[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.480]
Neil, a guy said that you were to blame for 9-11 as he was dying on the shoe.

[00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.480]
He thought you were like a little bit too.

[00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.840]
He stopped me in a men's room at Shulis.

[00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.740]
Now we know Pharrell is officially made.

[00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:14.420]
Let's hear it.

[00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.020]
He finally has had his first encounter with Gilbert.

[00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.180]
Oh my God, dude.

[00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.640]
I was like, dude, get away from me, please.

[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:21.680]
I didn't, you know, I didn't.

[00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.260]
He said if you hired all of the pilots and I'm like, oh, and Jesus Christ, dude, have a stake.

[00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:31.540]
That just was unbelievable.

[00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:32.320]
I couldn't believe it.

[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.500]
I'm in a men's header at the Shulis and I got some guy telling me that you're the devil.

[00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.680]
By the way, when you go back to Boca this afternoon or this morning, whatever,

[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.340]
how you're going, stop by and knock on your neighbor's door and just calm him down a little bit.

[00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.840]
Put his hair piece back in the center of it a little bit.

[00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.900]
He thinks that you posted his address, but you didn't.

[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.120]
And I'm also going to take over.

[00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.340]
Assoles can call him up to show what a can't tank-risk old dork he is.

[00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.840]
Absolutely.

[00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.660]
They can call him up and tell him anything and he gets all bent out of shape about it.

[00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.060]
We didn't put your address on our website yet, Mo.

[00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:00.900]
I yet, Mo.

[00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:02.220]
Yeah, I think what he did was.

[00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.500]
He did.

[00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:03.220]
Yeah, didn't I?

[00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:07.960]
I honestly think that when he found out that his address was on your website, he pulled his calf muscle.

[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:08.760]
Did he?

[00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.240]
He's even went that around today.

[00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.640]
He's got some kind of calf injury.

[00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.820]
Now, was he still reaching around to stick that tube back in this morning or not?

[00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.040]
Or did we embarrass him out of that?

[00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.060]
No, I haven't seen.

[00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.560]
He just pissed out of your butt, Mo.

[00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:25.360]
I was just trying to avoid any, you know, halitosis butt picking, crotch grabbing.

[00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:26.040]
Yeah.

[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.180]
I try to avoid all that.

[00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.040]
You really bring like a rubber cushion for that chair that you have to sit in that studio?

[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.620]
How many people got married in Toronto this weekend?

[00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.000]
About third of men?

[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.300]
Like, I mean, I know the game thing's going on.

[00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.840]
Is it a huge, have they taken over the entire city?

[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.440]
Yes.

[00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:42.960]
That was, that wasn't yesterday.

[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.200]
That's been that way for years.

[00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.280]

[00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.680]
I know how many Americans went up there and got married.

[00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.000]
About third of men.

[00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.660]
That is sweet.

[00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:49.520]
Have a great day, Neil.

[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:50.500]
You too, Scott.

[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:52.800]
Need some action.

[00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.380]
And now the sound of Jimmy Stewart.

[00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.280]
Making love to Catherine Hepburn.

[00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.640]
Now, some humorless schmuck out there is going to say,

[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.140]
oh, that's a very poor taste.

[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.340]
She just died yesterday.

[00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.740]
Her body isn't even lukewarm yet.

[00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:29.980]
You're already making fun of poor Kate.

[00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.380]
I don't think either one of them would cure at this point, do you?

[00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.700]
No.

[00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.000]
Jimmy Stewart and Catherine Hepburn are both pushing up daisies.

[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.620]
She never stole a freight train, but she was 96.

[00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:39.620]
Don't you think that's old enough?

[00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:40.140]
Yes.

[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.380]
I mean, I guess when you croak, you figure, well, whatever the number is,

[00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:46.440]
it wasn't quite old enough.

[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.160]
You know, but I think 96 is old enough.

[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.700]
I'll take it.

[00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.600]
I think 90 is old enough.

[00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.800]
By the way, I should mention this Saturday, my mother will be 90.

[00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:56.020]
What?

[00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.840]
Nothing?

[00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.300]
Are you laughing because I just said 90 isn't off?

[00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.080]
No, I just told myself a joke I never heard before.

[00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.840]
I wasn't necessarily thinking about her when I said that.

[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:04.260]
Of course not.

[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.760]
You would know.

[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.600]
Here's our poll question from our Catherine Hepburn's dead.

[00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:09.620]
What are their dialect lines?

[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.680]
Gregory Peck 87.

[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:13.400]
Chat Huntly.

[00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.600]
Well, you know, it's funny that you mentioned chat Huntly.

[00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.220]
Even though it was David Brinkley who died, he was 82.

[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.100]
But that documentary I told you about, which I'm going to play a couple of minutes from it,

[00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.820]
eventually.

[00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.160]
Star Wars Dreams on CBC News were last night.

[00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.000]
Our half documentary on this bullcrap, your government wasting $8 billion a year

[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.160]
on Star Wars again.

[00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.120]
See, basically, what this is all about.

[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.380]
It doesn't make any difference whether it's Reagan or W.

[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:39.720]
It's really not relevant.

[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:45.000]
Although Reagan, you know, put on a better, he was a better, a Bella Figura, whatever that means.

[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.880]
But it's the same bunch of Nazis, the same lunatics.

[00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:50.960]
Picking up right where they left off.

[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.260]
And so they're back with his Star Wars craft again.

[00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.460]
So they showed in the middle of the show that there was a,

[00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.460]
they were showing the different clips about that crap during the cold war

[00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.000]
and about hide under your desk in school when they dropped the bomb.

[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:08.700]
And here was Chat Huntly of all people in a PSA and immediately stand up and

[00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.640]
and put your arm over your face and then dive under the nearest table.

[00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:12.920]
It was a panic.

[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.360]
Yeah, we had that on.

[00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.000]
It was Chat Huntly.

[00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.840]
Duck and cover.

[00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:17.840]
Duck and power.

[00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.120]
Exactly.

[00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.980]
Duck and cover.

[00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.520]
Which by the way, speaking of duck and cover, you'll enjoy being a boy's picture on our website today and

[00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:24.200]
deservedly so.

[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.200]
You can not only see his getting ready to stuff, but also his giblets are on there.

[00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:31.820]
World famous giblets.

[00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:34.900]
Here's the result of our pull from Friday.

[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:39.880]
What celebrity with a marginal or weak face is still hot and wouldn't as luck would have it?

[00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.200]
Oh, I can't believe that this changed.

[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:44.140]
I didn't even look at that.

[00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.560]
Look at that.

[00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:45.560]
The result changed.

[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.540]
But I saw a flick with about 10 seconds of it with Cameron Diaz on Saturday.

[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:52.860]
And they have a point.

[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.260]
Depending on what day of the week it is.

[00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:56.040]
There's some time right here.

[00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:57.700]
Her face isn't, I don't know.

[00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.500]
It's not that she's all that pretty, but she has a nice smile.

[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:01.480]
She has charisma.

[00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.240]
She's a wonderful soft, you know.

[00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:04.840]
Well, that's what they're saying.

[00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.720]
Her face isn't the greatest, but she's hotter than tamale.

[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.260]
What celebrity with a marginal or weak face is still hot?

[00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:12.520]
Demi, more 257.

[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.200]
She comes from the behind and wins it.

[00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:14.640]
Demi.

[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:19.140]
Cameron Diaz 248 was in the lead all the way right to the end.

[00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:21.800]
Jamie Lee Curtis 216.

[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.420]
Jackie Johnson 206.

[00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:28.160]
Sarah Cajesica Parker as Eric puts it on here 173.

[00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.700]
Eric had a tremendously traumatic weekend, by the way.

[00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:33.820]
Jillian Barbury 112.

[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.520]
Ellen Barkin 80.

[00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:39.460]
Leah Remini 61.

[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:40.580]
She can do Jim.

[00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:41.120]
Avramini.

[00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:42.760]
They both have no UV.

[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.120]
Mimi Rogers 52.

[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:47.560]
Sean Connery 47.

[00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:49.220]
Sandra Bernhard 46.

[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:50.820]
Dean Kane 39.

[00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:53.540]
You see, you can tell that most of our audience are head of a sexual

[00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:54.920]
males because of Dean Kane.

[00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:57.840]
If we had a lot of fags and women out there, Dean came and had a lot more votes.

[00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:59.940]
Naomi Campbell 27.

[00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:01.920]
James Woods 23.

[00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:03.320]
Oh my god.

[00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:04.600]
What is wrong with you people?

[00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:06.020]
I had to be a crank vote, didn't it?

[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:06.780]
Yeah.

[00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.000]
Because I watched once upon a time in America.

[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.460]
Yesterday, the full three hour and 49 minute version,

[00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:14.480]
the director's cut, which is now available in your video store.

[00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:19.080]
Although two disc special edition, yes, people might be referring to James Woods.

[00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:19.640]
Shlong.

[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:23.720]
Remember that's one of those rumors when you're reading that book or that article

[00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:25.580]
about who's got the biggest one in Hollywood.

[00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:26.620]
Wouldn't make it a difference.

[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.080]
John Holmes had a big shlong too.

[00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:28.620]
Was he hot?

[00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:29.640]
Oh, oh,

[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.560]
Jada Jada Pinkett Smith 23,

[00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:33.860]
tried with Jada.

[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:34.240]
Yes.

[00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:35.920]
LL Cool J 18.

[00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:37.760]
Robert Redford 17.

[00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:40.460]
Sophia Coppola 15 votes.

[00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:40.920]
Oh.

[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:42.400]
Holy Toledo.

[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:44.400]
As Rick Weaver would say,

[00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:46.760]
well, wouldn't it be great to have Rick Weaver back doing him dolphin games?

[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:48.760]
Bernie Mac 13.

[00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:51.420]
Maureen Dowd 12.

[00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:52.760]
Laurie Medcalf 11.

[00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:53.480]
Paul Newman 11.

[00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:55.380]
Scott Beo in last place with 10.

[00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:57.200]
And I haven't seen him in a coonsate.

[00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.980]
So I have no idea what Scott's looking like these days.

[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:00.580]
Probably old, you know?

[00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:02.740]
Yeah, probably not looking all that good.

[00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:06.740]
Here's our passage from the Hillary book today.

[00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:08.720]
And anybody who's caught with Hillary book by the way,

[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:09.560]
will do 10 to 20.

[00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:12.380]
Why the hell are you people buying this book?

[00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:13.640]
Is there something wrong with these people?

[00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:16.240]
I bought it only because I felt like duty bound, you know?

[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:19.280]
Yeah, like a schmuck.

[00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:21.340]
But at least I'm making something useful out of it.

[00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:24.200]
Every day on the show exclusively since this is not the BBC.

[00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:26.700]
That fact's was so pathetic.

[00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:27.780]
Save your breath.

[00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:28.340]
They're reading it.

[00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:30.240]
I don't give a crap what they're doing on the BBC.

[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:32.100]
Our audience isn't listening to the BBC.

[00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:34.720]
I'm doing a pubic service here.

[00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:37.560]
I'm saving people like 28 bucks to their hard on cash.

[00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:42.440]
Hillary says on page two, how many days we've been doing this?

[00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:44.940]
One, two, three, four, five.

[00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:46.120]
This is day number six.

[00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:49.540]
So in six days, of course, there's only the top part of page two.

[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:54.160]
I'd say in about three years, we might get to the end.

[00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:58.420]
She says, my parents were typical of a generation who believed in the endless possibilities

[00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:02.360]
of America and whose values were rooted in the experience of living through the great depression.

[00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:06.120]
They believe that now don't be interjecting.

[00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:07.580]
You know, I think we don't.

[00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:09.520]
No, I didn't know was a run on sentence.

[00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:12.120]
There are two sentences in here.

[00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:12.400]
Okay.

[00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:16.760]
They believed in hard work, not entitlement, self-reliance, not self-indulgence.

[00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:20.940]
I'll even read the next paragraph as a bonus because it's a holiday week.

[00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:25.540]
That is the world in the family I was born into on October 26, 1947.

[00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:29.040]
We were middle class midwestern and very much a product of our place in time.

[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:34.220]
My mother, Dorothy Halla Rotem, was a homemaker whose days revolved around me and my two younger

[00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:37.160]
brothers and my father, Hugh E. Rotem, owned a small business.

[00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:41.600]
The challenges of their lives made me appreciate the opportunities of my life even more.

[00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:45.120]
Oh, should I have the violin's playing in the back, you know, I need oxygen.

[00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:49.280]
I mean, this is such a thrill.

[00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:57.840]
God, talk about hearts and flowers and just, it's crap is what it is, but that's okay because

[00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:00.500]
Hillary wrote it. Where's my cello lady?

[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:11.340]
The challenges of their lives made me appreciate the opportunities of my own life even more.

[00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:18.040]
You know, these assholes out there that are talking about her, you think she's going to be present?

[00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:22.360]
Seriously, if you're getting about the present, Pozo, what qualification does she have to be

[00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:26.040]
present of the God, they have my SPCA, anything, anything.

[00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:26.860]
I don't know.

[00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:30.100]
I mean, what are we talking about here?

[00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:34.220]
Oh, but her name is Clinton, so you and she was the once married to the president.

[00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:37.880]
She's the ice princess and she and Janet may have been getting it on for all we know.

[00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:42.460]
It's pretty damn embarrassing, seriously. Where the hell did we come up with these losers?

[00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:45.700]
Oh, it's thinking of that. Did you see the result of the, the poll?

[00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:48.560]
The online poll that we voted in?

[00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:49.680]
No, I did not.

[00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:51.120]
Move on.org.

[00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:54.120]
Well, we'll get to that. We had to post it over the weekend, but we'll get to that because it'll

[00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:56.260]
kill some really good time and we got today's poll.

[00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:00.960]
I'll be honest with you that there only a handful of new stories on the website today because

[00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:04.880]
there's nothing going on other than Kate Hepburn dying. I think and of course the

[00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:08.820]
aeromaps got a lot of a couple of chinks in the armor again and another shooting over there today.

[00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:10.880]
So says Israeli radio.

[00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:15.500]
Few little bumps in the road there after all these years you don't expect a smooth transition

[00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:21.160]
doing right? A few more people got to die. A whole bunch more people got to die and then maybe

[00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:28.680]
then maybe we'll talk turkey. 12 minutes after 10 at 560 WQA and this is tomorrow's Canada day

post I was like it it was about drugs so I watched three hour and 49 minute version of lots of

[00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:46.780]
part of time in america state the directors cut special to a disk edition with Robert deniro

[00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:52.760]
and Elizabeth Montgomery why do I always call her that I don't even can do Elizabeth Montgomery although

[00:15:52.760 --> 00:16:01.360]
one is dead Elizabeth Montgomery no one to George and Joe pesci see and the very grotesque and

[00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:08.920]
unsexual James Woods and a very young and later on very hot uh Brian loom he just kind of vanished

[00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:12.520]
and he was in a whole bunch of movies Brian loom and he was on that soap opera as the warm turns

[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:16.480]
and I guess they turned his warmer on a couple times too many and that was the end of him Brian

[00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:22.220]
loom you know who had great not only did he have great eyes but also the young Elizabeth McGovern

[00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:26.660]
man she had beautiful she had beautiful and that's awfully nice of her to show her breasts as often

[00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:30.460]
as she can and they'll let her and I'll tell you who else was really good and there was Tuesday

[00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:37.320]
well right she she was a pretty lady played Carol and a great young so you can you could tell

[00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:42.960]
Carol was enjoying it you know when they did the diamond heist and Robert deniro raped her and

[00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:51.140]
where really wasn't a rape right it was a thing it was a episode it was a thing and then when she

[00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:55.660]
came into their office she was like reaching around trying to figure out whose thing it was at any

[00:16:55.660 --> 00:17:00.040]
rate three hours and 49 minutes and the ending is still and if you'd listen to the commentary

[00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:04.860]
there's a guy that they have on the special features I don't know who the hell a guy was let's see

[00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:11.780]
uh footage not an original release yeah it's it's different if you're well someday when you're

[00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:19.740]
like want to hibernate and get a couple of half gallons of uh rires score ice cream I can't

[00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:23.700]
I can't find who the hell does that but at any rate there's a guy that does a narration the

[00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:28.360]
commentary later on it on the special disc and when you get to the end he says the same thing

[00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:33.280]
that we've all said that since the last scene well I mean I'm not going to spoil it because it's an

[00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:37.980]
old movie the last scene is the narrow back in the opium parlor again and it chops all over the

[00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:44.460]
place you know right and it ends with that big silly not just a smile but that big smid

[00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:48.500]
eat and grin on his face kind of like one of the movie that we saw recently we're ended where she

[00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:53.800]
liked broke out with a smile I don't want to say magnolia and you think uh huh and then the narrator

[00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:57.900]
says well a lot of speculation that the whole thing was just a pipe dream that's a little play on

[00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:04.300]
words right yeah and you think to yourself well if that's the case I just spent three hours and

[00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:08.780]
49 minutes uh watching a guy dreaming about something happen that never maybe happen right I hate that

[00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:13.420]
but what difference does it make it's just a freaking movie anyway no it's real it's reality oh is

[00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:17.620]
it yeah and if they and if it's a dream in the movie then uh then it's not real and that's uh that's

[00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:22.440]
wrong israel see there he goes again boys and girls there he goes picking on israel again

[00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:38.740]
later it sucked he said so bad he actually had to get up and walk out now that's interesting

[00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:43.000]
because I just got the facts minutes ago saying this was great and now we get a guy to get up and

[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:48.300]
walk down now this guy seems incredible I don't know why maybe because I think because it's the same

[00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:52.340]
guy that was in train spotting but the actor really shouldn't have anything to do with director

[00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:57.800]
right director from oh it was the same director that's what I heard oh my god well there's

[00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:01.040]
another one I watched that until he got his hand stuck in the toilet bowl reaching for his

[00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:58.580]
eating ass how can I have forgotten that since George is going to be doing the show next Monday

[00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:01.880]
and Monday Wednesdays and Fridays for the next two months basically

[00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:08.440]
eating ass the last thing I want to hear about oh I will say this I want to go on record

[00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:11.540]
to saying right now although I will not be listening when George is doing the show I'm not one

[00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:14.260]
of those people that since around like an old buddy do you know what I mean

[00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:17.960]
absolutely and listen to the radio when I'm not working taking notes calling in but I would

[00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:22.600]
much rather and I'm not saying this gratuitously I'm saying it from the bottom of my parts I would

[00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:29.300]
much rather hear about a eating ass than the marlins I as much as I love for well you know I do

[00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:34.120]
just got but this marlin thing is just leaves me limp you know all these people again I'll take

[00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:38.040]
two tickets I'll take eight tickets I don't want to hear about the marlins okay which which is fun

[00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:41.900]
I'm not telling them what to talk about or what that's not I'm just expressing an opinion I'd rather

[00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:48.180]
hear about eating ass than hear about the freaking Florida marlins okay it is so talk about beating a

[00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:53.500]
dead horse my god well it is unlikely we will be getting into eating ass why is that well just

[00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:57.360]
because we exhausted that in the day and a half that I talked it's an exhausted ass right but there

[00:22:57.360 --> 00:23:02.440]
is no chance yes we will be discussing the marlins there's a better chance there's slim but there's

[00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:05.860]
a better chance that you'll be discussing eating ass than the marlin at length and you will not

[00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:10.620]
be given any marlin tickets away no all right thank god for saying the word marlin I'm serious I

[00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:15.400]
can't I just can't deal with I know it's a long hot humid boring summer but it there's got to be

[00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:20.660]
something beside the freaking Florida marlins it's just oh I was thinking this yesterday the idea

[00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:24.320]
and I don't know however used to do it because remember when I was a big cubs fan there for a while

[00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:28.900]
was a hairy carry thing really and I'd sit there and I watch every guy damn game from the first

[00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:35.400]
pitch total I asked out I I could no longer watch a an entire baseball game in fact I can't watch

[00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:39.280]
an inning I couldn't watch a whole inning of baseball and I anymore than I could like a you know

have wild hot sex with Mohawar David and tear piece with his bag it's just it's just inconceivable

[00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:49.780]
to me you know how you drug past the gas station they'll have the high school cheerleaders doing a

[00:23:49.780 --> 00:23:54.580]
car wash to raise right we'll be giving tickets away to those all right now we're talking all right

[00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:59.580]
pulled up my ass and died. I shot him in the face with my vapor. The worst happened

[00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:04.080]
later when I covered his desk with used toilet paper. To walk in the strip club my

[00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:09.280]
contestants were filled up. Moons the bartender took a dump in a tip club went over to a

[00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:13.640]
dancer had a fucking cigar. She lifted a leg up and I knew she was a

[00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:19.920]
father. 99% of my life I was lied to. I just found out my mom got all gas and I do.

[00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:25.340]
I told her I grow up to be a famous rapper. They were wrecked about strange noises made on the

[00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:29.500]
grandpa. You know you will endure when the women rush to leave. You try to hold

[00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:34.480]
the back but you must eat it really. This guy at White Castle said it was pretty cool.

somebody maybe had did a couple too many magic mushrooms or something with ferella of see one

[00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:44.160]
thing about Scott as much as great as he is and we love him and we're delighted that he's with us

[00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:49.600]

I tell you one thing about those other diets where they have like the pre-packaged food, all of that food blows.

[00:34:18.570 --> 00:34:21.870]
It really does. They give you like little boxes of crap, with a lot of chemicals in it.

[00:34:22.070 --> 00:34:26.930]
That's one of the things that sets balance for life apart from the others is because they give you great fresh delicious food

[00:34:26.930 --> 00:34:30.390]
and it keeps you satisfied. If you're not satisfied and you're cheating like crazy,

[00:34:30.630 --> 00:34:32.590]
what the hell's the point of being on it and spending a lot of money?

[00:34:33.070 --> 00:34:36.830]
But with balance for life, they deliver right to your door by 6 a.m. a little black sack.

[00:34:36.830 --> 00:34:41.450]
And that's the key to your success and lose some weight with balance for life because all your food for the day is in there.

[00:34:41.830 --> 00:34:45.550]
And you get to choose between two alternatives for each meal every day that's run a program.

[00:34:45.970 --> 00:34:52.550]
No cooking, no shopping, no cleaning, no worries, no calorie counting, no carbohydrate counting because they do all accounting for you based on the zone diet.

[00:34:52.970 --> 00:34:58.150]
All you have to worry about is reaching outside your door there by 6 a.m. a.m. and grabbing your little black sack. Just grab it.

[00:34:58.570 --> 00:35:03.110]
Three gourmet meals, two delicious snacks right inside there, and believe me the food is fresh and delicious.

[00:35:03.110 --> 00:35:08.990]
They got fructadas and omelets and all kinds of delicious goodies, beef and fish and chicken. You name it, they got it. See food?

[00:35:09.610 --> 00:35:13.550]
So if you're really frustrated, try out all the other diets and you haven't been able to lose that weight yet.

[00:35:13.710 --> 00:35:19.190]
If you're out of shape lethargic, if you're diabetic or maybe on the verge, do yourself a big favor and at least try balance for life.

Well congratulations, get a life.

[00:35:52.370 --> 00:36:01.570]
We got an inside wall street 10. Now she's gonna pay for it.

[00:36:01.570 --> 00:36:03.570]
Alright!

[00:37:06.010 --> 00:37:12.890]
10.46.5.60. WQ. I'ma got the mad dog at 2. The Humper at 4. In the studio no less till 6.30. Now they're tough to sign.

[00:37:13.450 --> 00:37:16.910]
Then you got the pre-game show Marlins undecided Braves at the Marlins.

[00:37:18.090 --> 00:37:19.850]
705. Let's not talk about the Marlins showing.

[00:37:19.950 --> 00:37:23.070]
Okay. Even though they give up 45 runs in three games and pull the middle game out.

[00:37:23.410 --> 00:37:29.270]
In the case follows the baseball game, Joe and Mark overnight 2 to 5 in the morning and then the crusty old fart and guilty at 5.00 a.m.

[00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:34.970]
177 votes already. The last thing I want to hear about on the Arrangeers show is sports.

[00:37:35.190 --> 00:37:40.190]
Sports. 46. I guess that's why clearance don't listen to this show.

[00:37:41.310 --> 00:37:50.330]
See if you walk out there in a hall you'll hear this show coming from Muff's Orifice and from the other Orifice you'll hear Clarence listen to Fox Sports.

[00:37:50.330 --> 00:37:56.330]
If you're in team, if you ran out there right now, be in your boy, run out there right now and see what Clarence is listening to.

[00:37:56.490 --> 00:38:01.570]
Come on. He didn't get a diary. Who's that Clarets? Oh he does keep a diary though.

[00:38:03.410 --> 00:38:06.390]
You ought to read those steamy entries about him and the beast.

[00:38:07.350 --> 00:38:11.330]
Sports. 46. Hockey. 40. They don't want to hear about that at all.

[00:38:12.070 --> 00:38:16.470]
Let's do a hockey show. Eating ass George eating ass 21.

[00:38:17.710 --> 00:38:21.670]
I mentioned white lottery. I'll vote it more than once. Music 20.

[00:38:21.830 --> 00:38:25.750]
They don't want to hear about my music. But I tell you that you were going to was it you're going to December or last December.

[00:38:26.450 --> 00:38:30.610]
Something all those music shows. Oh my God. We might as well shut the transmitter off.

[00:38:31.070 --> 00:38:36.070]
I thought they were great. Me too. Yeah, you did not. I did. I liked it. Yeah.

[00:38:36.550 --> 00:38:43.430]
Just like you like the bedtime. Well, I think that's that's the new deal. Sure. If George likes it, that means that we won't do it.

[00:38:44.370 --> 00:38:47.750]
Because it means it's going to go like let's see eating ass 26.

[00:38:48.150 --> 00:38:52.230]
Moe Howard. I never did tell the thing about for well that I'm about to schedule. I'll get to it.

[00:38:52.470 --> 00:38:55.430]
One thing about this week. We have we don't have to rush. You know what I mean?

[00:38:56.270 --> 00:39:00.150]
Take your time. Relax. We almost killed the first hour here already. We had a call.

[00:39:01.870 --> 00:39:06.990]
Moe Howard, David, 22. And if you want to see about that movie 28 days later, they have their own website.

[00:39:07.990 --> 00:39:10.930]
You can just do a search on it because I don't know right now what it was.

[00:39:10.930 --> 00:39:17.110]
But they had their own website. Danny Boyle. That's the director. Am I right? Then he do trans spotting.

[00:39:17.290 --> 00:39:22.250]
Okay, I guess we guess. Oh no, you're not the one who watched trans spotting right? I watched it.

[00:39:22.650 --> 00:39:28.890]
You watched it. Sure. Oh my God. Of course. Oh, see, I you know something. I get chills just thinking about that.

[00:39:29.030 --> 00:39:35.050]
I got through it. And it takes me quite a lot of my hell of a lot to gross me out. Believe you me. They don't come more perverted than me.

[00:39:35.050 --> 00:39:40.530]
But watching some guys swishing around with his hand and then toilet bowl after he's just taken and not just any toilet bowl.

[00:39:40.670 --> 00:39:50.070]
Oh, man. The last thing I want to hear about on the Eroger show sports 48 hockey 43 eating ass 26.

[00:39:50.350 --> 00:39:56.450]
Moe Howard, David, 22. And you like that? Absolutely. Music 21. Politics 15.

[00:39:57.290 --> 00:40:01.670]
Q. I. Am office politics. I think we should have probably put office politics, but we don't have room for it.

[00:40:02.170 --> 00:40:06.830]
Movies eight and religion only two out of 193 votes in just a half an hour or less.

[00:40:07.430 --> 00:40:12.970]
193 votes already. Religion only two, which is a great. We got a couple of call. We got a car phone there.

[00:40:15.910 --> 00:40:20.310]
We got a car. Is that what he said? Yeah. I have to play that again.

[00:40:21.410 --> 00:40:26.930]
Don't be picking on the bird. That's bad. The man's been dead for a couple of years now. And you're picking on the bird.

[00:40:26.930 --> 00:40:31.390]
I bet that Johnny Dark shows up there sucking around demanding a free lunch if you keep that up. You think?

[00:40:32.530 --> 00:40:36.470]
Here's Miami. Hello. That's the best thing. Say anything. The bird.

[00:40:37.090 --> 00:40:41.750]
What do you say anything? Just say something. Yeah, what's one of the all time best movie stuff?

[00:40:42.230 --> 00:40:47.730]
I'm telling you now. I'm not kidding. The guy on the radio gave it three stars. The newspaper Miami hero three and a half.

[00:40:47.730 --> 00:40:54.690]
And I'd give it a negative 15,000. That was the worst movie I've seen in my life. And I tortured myself and sat for the whole thing.

[00:40:55.170 --> 00:41:01.370]
I'll be damned. Well, it figures if it's by the same people that did train spotting it had to be a piece of crap.

[00:41:01.570 --> 00:41:09.030]
Oh, if you're part of expression in that the English accent. Well, I hate that. Can't stand in Brits.

[00:41:09.370 --> 00:41:13.970]
I don't know. I get the shmits from here in Brits. Well, thanks again. We got you down, pal. I gotta go. I'm getting sick.

[00:41:16.650 --> 00:41:23.030]
That's good. Well, I feel really redreemed because I watched the two dispensal once a pound of time in America,

[00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:28.610]
which is a damn good flick. One of my favorites, including lots and lots of scenes we had never seen before and killed a really good afternoon.

[00:41:28.750 --> 00:41:32.410]
When I could have been outside the middle of hundreds of thousands of screaming, missing fags, I'll pass.

[00:41:33.510 --> 00:41:39.910]
And so I enjoyed it a lot. And I could have instead been in the theater watching 28 days later.

[00:41:40.610 --> 00:41:46.410]
I probably would have walked out. My first of all, I wouldn't go to see it because if it's by the same group of British misfits who did train spotting,

[00:41:46.410 --> 00:41:53.590]
I would want to go see it. Yeah. Let's take a look at that eating ass. Keep your eye on it. It's moving up.

[00:41:53.650 --> 00:41:58.990]
It was a late edition. 31 already. See? Just I just mentioned this. I never tell you what to talk about.

[00:41:59.490 --> 00:42:07.230]
And you'll notice religion only to is way this in last place. Right. That's why I think it's time to stoke up those religious shows again.

[00:42:09.290 --> 00:42:16.390]
Point the thing with all these religious fakers, all this God bull crap. Oh, there was an not only that watch that thing on the BBC or CBC last time.

[00:42:16.390 --> 00:42:26.210]
Right. That documentary. But also there was an interesting show on whenever the hell was over the weekend about the Aztecs about all these different gods, you know, in the sun God and love that stuff.

[00:42:26.650 --> 00:42:28.070]
Oh, yeah. It was really pretty interesting.

[00:42:28.270 --> 00:42:37.070]
Total collateral. Right. Exactly. And about all these different gods. Everybody had their own gods and everybody made up their stories and all this other bull crap.

[00:42:37.070 --> 00:42:44.470]
And of course the the eagle was at the eagle or was it the hawk? Whatever the hell was some big bird eating the snake was represented the.

[00:42:44.470 --> 00:42:53.370]
Yeah. This has been going on since man first crawled out of the slime if you pardon me, steal that expression and you're still with a God bull crap. What are you going to give up the baloney?

[00:42:53.450 --> 00:43:06.570]
Okay. What are you going to give it up? Oh God. Right. Man, it's so sad. All these people still kill each other because our gods better than your God. You don't believe in the same crap. And Jesus is going to come and get you now, but a great lead into that segment.

[00:43:07.910 --> 00:43:22.170]
From that document to the last night star wars. The long wind and wilderness is being prepared as the new high frontier. Just a little clip to protect America from the fear of missiles fired over the top of the world from countries like North Korea.

[00:43:24.810 --> 00:43:42.570]
If in fact North Korea were ever to develop a missile that could hit the United States, we would see it. And it is very unlikely that any present in the United States could wait to see if North Korea were to launch that missile and then see if our system could somehow intercept it.

[00:43:42.570 --> 00:43:56.070]
It's much more likely that the United States would move preemptively to intercept it before it could be launched. There are many many options for the missile defense to protect yourself against a rogue state threat.

[00:44:00.050 --> 00:44:05.070]
America's defense is online on sea and in the air.

[00:44:08.270 --> 00:44:11.070]
But it's greatest right is from space.

[00:44:16.750 --> 00:44:25.070]
The 50-year quest for a secure roof over America does never lost its hold on the nation's ideological warriors.

[00:44:33.030 --> 00:44:48.930]
For some true believers, the fear of America's nuclear vulnerability has always stirred visions of the biblical armageddon, the battleground of the final struggle between good and evil.

[00:44:49.730 --> 00:45:02.850]
The world could likely come to cataclysmic end in the very near future. And then the heaven will pass away with the terrible noise and the heavenly bodies will disappear in fire and the earth and everything in it will be destroyed.

[00:45:05.370 --> 00:45:08.630]
Midnight hours on us, the road to Armageddon.

[00:45:28.890 --> 00:45:31.530]
The Ring of T Дажеir...

[00:45:38.190 --> 00:45:48.890]
There are so many movies and TV teams ready to start MO and the Returner will become through this tragedy.

[00:45:48.890 --> 00:45:54.450]
President. Gee shocked. Yeah. Yeah. They ripped him an ass. It was great. It was on a CBC news world last night. Oh

[00:45:55.170 --> 00:45:58.570]
Something you probably won't be seeing on your local TV channels in the US

[00:45:58.570 --> 00:46:00.210]
It's one of those things, you know

[00:46:00.210 --> 00:46:04.790]
You can either give the public the truth and tell it like it is or you can continue like a wave in a flag and singing

[00:46:04.790 --> 00:46:11.630]
God bless America. Oh, which that was an interesting point late in the movie. There once upon a time in America after he walks out of the mansion

[00:46:11.630 --> 00:46:15.790]
Mm-hmm after refusing to kill James Woods mister or is it named Mr

[00:46:15.790 --> 00:46:18.190]
No, no, no, no. He was noodles

[00:46:18.190 --> 00:46:20.510]
But what was the name of the whatever the hell a guy's name was?

[00:46:21.130 --> 00:46:24.590]
He was the chairman of the commerce committee whatever the hell of a James Woods

[00:46:25.990 --> 00:46:29.730]
And he walks out to the corner he gets through the gate and he stands there and he starts

[00:46:30.190 --> 00:46:31.930]
There's first to see with a garbage truck

[00:46:32.830 --> 00:46:38.970]
And we have the feeling that James Woods hopped in the back of the garbage truck and there's getting chewed up to pieces and then

[00:46:39.950 --> 00:46:44.250]
The two old big cars come down the street with a big prolly a party animals in it

[00:46:44.250 --> 00:46:47.090]
And he here Kate Smith with God bless America. That is a great scene

[00:46:47.810 --> 00:46:51.930]
What does it mean? We haven't got any idea, but it's a great scene. It's no trans spotting

[00:46:52.610 --> 00:46:55.650]

[00:49:51.430 --> 00:49:52.450]
near your home, oh.

[00:49:53.370 --> 00:49:54.090]
Thank you.

[00:49:54.610 --> 00:49:55.830]
Hi, my name's Huy.

[00:49:56.210 --> 00:49:57.630]
That's a pretty one, I'm having this.

[00:49:57.930 --> 00:49:59.810]
I feel like running down this street.

[00:49:59.810 --> 00:50:02.810]
Lincoln, look, look, I'm an Lincoln man.

[00:50:03.330 --> 00:50:04.370]
You want a Mickey Mouse!

[00:50:05.050 --> 00:50:05.610]
Where am I?

[00:50:06.310 --> 00:50:06.950]
Who looks?

[00:50:07.170 --> 00:50:08.050]
Do you want to read me Pally?

[00:50:08.310 --> 00:50:09.030]
Here's your major.

[00:50:09.310 --> 00:50:12.430]
I don't read my highly desirable ass ass.

[00:50:13.050 --> 00:50:13.290]
What?

[00:50:14.250 --> 00:50:15.730]
I'm an Lincoln man.

[00:50:16.350 --> 00:50:17.710]
I'm an American man.

[00:50:18.150 --> 00:50:19.270]
Can I have a race?

[00:50:19.430 --> 00:50:20.250]
May I, just?

[00:50:20.810 --> 00:50:22.930]
Hey, Lincoln, I'm an American man.

[00:50:23.350 --> 00:50:24.450]
Take a look at this hair.

[00:50:25.010 --> 00:50:26.630]
And from all of that, who's on it?

[00:50:26.970 --> 00:50:27.890]
Hey, don't!

[00:50:27.890 --> 00:50:29.130]
Your hair dropped me!

[00:50:29.450 --> 00:50:31.490]
Yeah, alright, I was on radio, you know.

[00:50:32.010 --> 00:50:33.250]
I was on the radio.

[00:50:33.950 --> 00:50:36.630]
Just so gun the tool that you won't feel acting.

[00:50:39.490 --> 00:50:41.590]
I was on the radio.

[00:50:41.590 --> 00:50:41.590]

[00:50:42.610 --> 00:50:44.930]
I was on the radio.

[00:50:46.010 --> 00:50:47.430]
I was on the radio.

[00:50:50.910 --> 00:50:51.910]
Hello, Paul.

[00:50:52.390 --> 00:50:55.890]
Dupin' I decided to stop by and see how you were doing.

[00:50:58.590 --> 00:51:00.230]
Oh, this is terrible.

[00:51:02.530 --> 00:51:06.910]
No, no, no, no, no, no.

[00:51:07.510 --> 00:51:11.450]
You know, the difference between late and the movie scene with Sarah Golefarb there at

[00:51:11.450 --> 00:51:14.530]
the institution, difference between her and Mo with the same stage as she had better

[00:51:14.530 --> 00:51:14.810]
here.

[00:51:15.530 --> 00:51:16.010]
Uh-oh.

[00:51:16.530 --> 00:51:18.570]
Now, speaking of Mo, I just can't stop.

[00:51:18.730 --> 00:51:19.610]
I'm just transfixed.

[00:51:19.750 --> 00:51:23.010]
Maybe I am hypnotized by the new picture we have on our website.

[00:51:23.010 --> 00:51:27.530]
But if you look at the head, that's the work of brilliance on here.

[00:51:27.630 --> 00:51:31.170]
The fact that the head is, it's actually moving around.

[00:51:31.610 --> 00:51:31.730]
Yeah.

[00:51:31.890 --> 00:51:36.490]
I like the other cut and paste ones with, you know, our cute, but this one, he's, uh,

[00:51:36.610 --> 00:51:37.070]
that's him.

[00:51:37.370 --> 00:51:37.810]
Yeah.

[00:51:41.190 --> 00:51:42.070]
Oh, God.

[00:51:42.470 --> 00:51:43.470]
It's a beautiful thing.

[00:51:44.850 --> 00:51:47.810]
So anyway, did I finally finish telling about how Furella is not going to be doing in

[00:51:47.810 --> 00:51:49.190]
the film in this, uh, this film?

[00:51:49.330 --> 00:51:51.330]
No, but I was told that it's not definite yet.

[00:51:51.890 --> 00:51:53.570]
Oh, and I like, who told you that, tough?

[00:51:54.450 --> 00:51:56.490]
When did you tell you this recently?

[00:51:58.190 --> 00:51:59.130]
Recently like when?

[00:51:59.290 --> 00:52:00.270]
Now you were sitting there.

[00:52:00.310 --> 00:52:02.050]
You were freaking that you're witness, okay?

[00:52:02.410 --> 00:52:02.510]
Yeah.

[00:52:02.510 --> 00:52:06.630]
When he told me this morning, he thought a show that, uh, it's not going to happen and

[00:52:06.630 --> 00:52:07.450]
yada yada yada yada.

[00:52:07.570 --> 00:52:11.930]
He barring some cataclysmic thing that, uh, we're, it's going to be apologized if you

[00:52:11.930 --> 00:52:14.110]
got the wrong impression, but it's not a done deal.

[00:52:14.110 --> 00:52:17.370]
It's just very unlikely that I, well, why don't we just say it's not going to happen?

[00:52:17.370 --> 00:52:17.630]
Okay.

[00:52:17.690 --> 00:52:19.650]
Why don't we just do it the way we've always done it before?

[00:52:19.650 --> 00:52:22.370]
Or we could just say nothing and turn on the radio and something will be on there.

[00:52:22.390 --> 00:52:22.750]
Yeah, that's right.

[00:52:22.930 --> 00:52:26.310]
Turn it on next Monday morning at 10 and see what the lasagna may be for all of just

[00:52:26.310 --> 00:52:26.810]
keep going.

[00:52:26.990 --> 00:52:30.010]
You know, he has a habit of although today I must say he must have been in a hurry for

[00:52:30.010 --> 00:52:34.410]
something because you notice I didn't have to say, see, it's got to have to like encourage

[00:52:34.410 --> 00:52:35.350]
him to leave, which is fun.

[00:52:35.510 --> 00:52:37.710]
I enjoy doing that, but I didn't have to do that today.

[00:52:38.330 --> 00:52:40.110]
So he must have had like a hot date or something.

[00:52:40.410 --> 00:52:43.790]
Anyway, TBA to be announced at a leader date.

[00:52:43.810 --> 00:52:46.710]
So two in next week, but we think it's going to be George Monday Wednesday and Friday,

[00:52:46.710 --> 00:52:49.410]
and I'll be on Tuesday and Thursday, although it's probably not a good idea.

[00:52:50.470 --> 00:52:54.190]
Now, and especially these last two weeks, last week and this week a very bad idea, you

[00:52:54.190 --> 00:52:55.570]
won't be seeing that happen again next year.

[00:52:55.810 --> 00:52:56.430]
Guaranteed Greg.

[00:52:57.750 --> 00:53:00.650]
The last thing, especially look at that phone, is that one call might as well get out of

[00:53:00.650 --> 00:53:01.410]
the way it'll be short.

[00:53:01.750 --> 00:53:02.290]
Here's Hollywood.

[00:53:02.470 --> 00:53:02.650]
Hello.

[00:53:03.270 --> 00:53:03.530]
Hello.

[00:53:03.970 --> 00:53:04.370]
Yes, sir.

[00:53:04.650 --> 00:53:05.450]
Neil, how you doing, man?

[00:53:05.770 --> 00:53:05.890]
Good.

[00:53:06.510 --> 00:53:11.630]
Hey, I listened to you since I was about like a six and a half years old.

[00:53:12.130 --> 00:53:12.390]
Oh, right.

[00:53:12.730 --> 00:53:13.470]
Since you were a baby.

[00:53:13.470 --> 00:53:13.750]
Yeah.

[00:53:14.190 --> 00:53:16.610]
And two things.

[00:53:17.030 --> 00:53:23.910]
One, Mohaward is definitely not what he appears to be.

[00:53:24.290 --> 00:53:24.650]
Absolutely.

[00:53:25.350 --> 00:53:27.210]
No, he's a donkey, donkey's ass.

[00:53:27.690 --> 00:53:33.430]
And two, Richie Hebner and Chuck Meyer did have a homosexual relationship.

[00:53:33.830 --> 00:53:35.190]
I swear, God.

[00:53:36.150 --> 00:53:39.390]
Jesus Christ, Christ Almighty, and Hallelujah.

[00:53:39.890 --> 00:53:41.610]
Holy Jesus Christ, Almighty.

[00:53:41.610 --> 00:53:43.330]
The, uh, low, holy, holy wood.

[00:53:43.390 --> 00:53:43.570]
Okay.

[00:53:43.630 --> 00:53:44.330]
Have a great day, pal.

[00:53:44.390 --> 00:53:45.190]
Call us when you get out.

[00:53:46.270 --> 00:53:49.090]
He must have just watched the Requiem over the weekend.

[00:53:50.410 --> 00:53:53.850]
The last thing I want to hear about on the near Roger show is sport 74.

[00:53:54.010 --> 00:53:55.750]
And that was our only call, by the way.

[00:53:57.130 --> 00:53:58.310]
Don't answer him, be an aboy.

[00:53:58.370 --> 00:53:59.390]
Let him, let me do screenless.

[00:54:00.390 --> 00:54:02.390]
I don't want to put you ahead of very stressful weekend.

[00:54:04.050 --> 00:54:06.250]
Or was it we that had a very stressful weekend, George?

[00:54:07.310 --> 00:54:07.630]
What?

[00:54:07.790 --> 00:54:08.050]
I'm sorry.

[00:54:08.210 --> 00:54:09.190]
I was, uh, good.

[00:54:09.190 --> 00:54:09.590]
My ears.

[00:54:09.870 --> 00:54:10.170]
Good.

[00:54:10.610 --> 00:54:13.370]
The last thing I wanted to hear about on the near Roger show sport 74.

[00:54:13.810 --> 00:54:16.710]
We got enough sports, the other 20 hours or 16 hours that they wouldn't want to lay

[00:54:16.710 --> 00:54:18.250]
that at Mark and the Joe and Joe and Mark.

[00:54:19.010 --> 00:54:19.970]
Uh, that's right.

[00:54:19.970 --> 00:54:21.050]
They're only on three hours now.

[00:54:21.050 --> 00:54:23.070]
So three, uh, the other 17 hours a day.

[00:54:24.090 --> 00:54:27.910]
Sports, sports, sports, marlin, sports, sports, marlin, sports.

[00:54:28.290 --> 00:54:31.690]
I mean, come on already with a marlin, with a marlin droppings, okay?

[00:54:32.150 --> 00:54:32.550]
Jesus.

[00:54:33.590 --> 00:54:35.950]
Tockey 55, eating ass 51.

[00:54:36.230 --> 00:54:38.410]
You know what's how fast eating ass is moving up the list?

[00:54:38.410 --> 00:54:42.410]
Yeah, they're saying you have just grossed them out with that eating ass stuff about it

[00:54:42.410 --> 00:54:43.910]
100 times more often than I have.

[00:54:44.450 --> 00:54:45.630]
What's that eating ass?

[00:54:46.570 --> 00:54:48.130]
I've done shows on eating ass.

[00:54:48.270 --> 00:54:51.050]
No, but you meant the only thing I ever said about it, I've said two thing.

[00:54:51.110 --> 00:54:51.390]
Oh, wait a minute.

[00:54:51.490 --> 00:54:52.070]
This is very important.

[00:54:52.250 --> 00:54:56.890]
How many of those animals and is there a way to build a barrier to prevent another

[00:54:56.890 --> 00:54:58.410]
jump from animals to humans?

[00:54:58.870 --> 00:54:59.110]
Right.

[00:54:59.430 --> 00:55:04.950]
Now, do you think the oncoming winter or fall this year would have any impact?

[00:55:05.090 --> 00:55:07.410]
How the hell does he know you stupid bits are talking about SARS?

[00:55:07.410 --> 00:55:08.350]
No more SARS.

[00:55:08.350 --> 00:55:09.010]
Bye bye.

[00:55:09.350 --> 00:55:11.490]
Now, in that finished this year, now, what was that just saying?

[00:55:11.990 --> 00:55:14.290]
You were talking about how it was eating ass.

[00:55:14.290 --> 00:55:18.010]
They had to have two summers ago that was the extent of my eating ass content.

[00:55:18.110 --> 00:55:21.310]
The only thing I've ever said about eating ass is that I find it disgusting that a grown

[00:55:21.310 --> 00:55:24.310]
man like Dwight Lutterdale would be like picking out a dead woman like a ambitious like

[00:55:24.310 --> 00:55:24.490]
that.

[00:55:24.550 --> 00:55:25.350]
That's all I ever said.

[00:55:25.530 --> 00:55:29.210]
Oh, something about picking ass.

[00:55:29.510 --> 00:55:30.890]
And then of course, we got to that more business.

[00:55:31.030 --> 00:55:31.390]
Absolutely.

[00:55:31.650 --> 00:55:32.290]
It was really disgusting.

[00:55:32.830 --> 00:55:34.330]
I knew he was a CD old fart.

[00:55:37.210 --> 00:55:39.490]
Moe Howard David had spoken of that 37.

[00:55:40.130 --> 00:55:42.130]
Last thing they want to hear about is Moe.

[00:55:42.450 --> 00:55:44.450]
Music 24, politics 20.

[00:55:45.430 --> 00:55:49.750]
And I have a feeling that those 20 are probably people who don't like my political stand

[00:55:49.750 --> 00:55:50.390]
in yours either.

[00:55:50.770 --> 00:55:55.770]
People right wing assholes who sat on this lunatic, this dangerous maniac, this religious

[00:55:55.770 --> 00:55:56.990]
nutcase that we got in there.

[00:55:57.190 --> 00:55:58.370]
Nothing like rap Nazis.

[00:55:58.890 --> 00:56:02.170]
Yeah, nothing more than Ronald Reagan with worse acting and worse here.

[00:56:03.350 --> 00:56:05.210]
Moe 15, that's not too bad.

[00:56:05.330 --> 00:56:06.750]
Only 5% to 1 here about the movies.

[00:56:06.910 --> 00:56:07.750]
We like the movie shows.

[00:56:08.050 --> 00:56:09.570]
QWAM office politics only 11.

[00:56:09.710 --> 00:56:10.410]
That's one of their favorites.

[00:56:10.750 --> 00:56:12.850]
And religion only 5 out of 295 votes.

[00:56:13.110 --> 00:56:18.170]
A spectacular response on our poll today because the website has got the new, what what

[00:56:18.170 --> 00:56:20.710]
name are we going to give that is that just dancing Moe?

[00:56:20.730 --> 00:56:25.690]
Sure one out of dancing to work Moe, whatever dancing to our dual, what are dwarf Moe who

[00:56:25.690 --> 00:56:26.310]
never looked better.

[00:56:26.490 --> 00:56:26.890]
Absolutely.

[00:56:27.170 --> 00:56:29.610]
And he don't even have on his lime green pants or checkered pants.

[00:56:29.610 --> 00:56:34.430]
He's got a lovely kind of puse red reddish, have the color eyes and brings here that

[00:56:34.430 --> 00:56:38.150]
reddish outfit, rust, brick, whatever, poly, brindle, brindle suit.

[00:56:38.290 --> 00:56:39.230]
You look lovely Moe.

[00:56:39.270 --> 00:56:39.790]
Never look better.

[00:56:40.850 --> 00:56:43.710]
So anyway, like I said, the schedule would be whatever the hell we feel like putting on

[00:56:43.710 --> 00:56:43.850]
it.

[00:56:44.070 --> 00:56:47.490]
So there's an incentive to in it and see if we're ever shots up at 10 o'clock.

[00:56:47.750 --> 00:56:49.490]
Well, at least if nothing else, you have a nice crossover.

[00:56:49.810 --> 00:56:51.090]
Oh, sure, for like four hours.

[00:56:51.210 --> 00:56:51.890]
What do you think, George?

[00:56:52.050 --> 00:56:55.070]
Who is that fruitcake there in the island who is having diarrhea all over me?

[00:56:55.510 --> 00:56:57.350]
We're going to talk about coos and Quinn.

[00:56:58.270 --> 00:57:01.450]
I see WQAM.

[00:57:05.010 --> 00:57:06.210]
WQAM screenless line.

[00:57:08.010 --> 00:57:08.490]
No.

[00:57:09.410 --> 00:57:11.210]
Now here's the line six watch.

[00:57:11.510 --> 00:57:12.370]
Keep your ear open.

[00:57:13.170 --> 00:57:13.650]
WQAM.

[00:57:14.530 --> 00:57:15.570]
I'm water parking.

[00:57:15.810 --> 00:57:16.850]
Because you are coming to numbers.

[00:57:17.190 --> 00:57:18.110]
This is the chronic guy.

[00:57:18.250 --> 00:57:18.550]
Chronic.

[00:57:18.770 --> 00:57:19.350]
Chronic go away.

[00:57:19.750 --> 00:57:20.670]
And we got your fax this morning.

[00:57:20.670 --> 00:57:21.430]
It's in the Schmidt can.

[00:57:21.590 --> 00:57:21.710]
Okay.

[00:57:22.010 --> 00:57:22.270]
Chronic.

[00:57:22.270 --> 00:57:23.970]
This is another guy changes his name every day.

[00:57:24.550 --> 00:57:25.570]
Get a life.

[00:57:25.770 --> 00:57:26.590]
Get a life.

[00:57:26.590 --> 00:57:27.370]
Go away.

[00:57:29.070 --> 00:57:33.790]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line.

[00:57:33.990 --> 00:57:37.790]
These people today, boy, it's going to be this way all week and you wait till next week.

[00:57:37.970 --> 00:57:38.410]
Woo.

[00:57:38.610 --> 00:57:39.070]
Oh, God.

[00:57:39.290 --> 00:57:42.250]
You'll wish that for I was filling from like 10 to 2 Monday Wednesday and Friday.

[00:57:42.390 --> 00:57:42.610]
What do you mean?

[00:57:42.790 --> 00:57:43.510]
I already do.

[00:57:43.890 --> 00:57:44.550]
Why is that?

[00:57:45.490 --> 00:57:46.070]
Less work.

[00:57:46.350 --> 00:57:46.910]
Same pay.

[00:57:47.690 --> 00:57:49.010]
Less work and same pay.

[00:57:49.110 --> 00:57:50.350]
That's our motto of QAM.

[00:57:50.570 --> 00:57:51.730]
I'm teaching them well.

[00:57:52.210 --> 00:57:54.250]
Although I didn't take my own message this year.

[00:57:54.350 --> 00:57:55.990]
I should have I shouldn't be here today.

[00:57:56.410 --> 00:57:57.670]
I should still be sleeping.

[00:57:57.790 --> 00:58:00.650]
You know something I can't get back on this thing again because they just won't stop

[00:58:00.650 --> 00:58:01.770]
looking at dancing mo.

[00:58:02.090 --> 00:58:03.610]
They're obsessed with dancing mo.

[00:58:03.910 --> 00:58:05.530]
Give poor dancing mo arrest.

[00:58:05.890 --> 00:58:06.210]
Absolutely.

[00:58:06.930 --> 00:58:07.950]
307 votes on it.

[00:58:08.030 --> 00:58:09.030]
Religions only got six.

[00:58:10.050 --> 00:58:10.850]
So there you go.

[00:58:10.930 --> 00:58:14.110]
That's one of your specialities as they say is that anti-religion crap.

[00:58:14.310 --> 00:58:16.290]
And I ordered a book from Amazon.com.

[00:58:16.350 --> 00:58:18.670]
I'm very proud to say my first time I've ordered anything from them.

[00:58:19.470 --> 00:58:20.150]
They're great.

[00:58:20.150 --> 00:58:20.790]
They are great.

[00:58:21.970 --> 00:58:25.390]
They send you back a confirmation within about just a few seconds.

[00:58:25.590 --> 00:58:26.290]
By the third man.

[00:58:26.490 --> 00:58:28.430]
And then this morning I got a thing on there.

[00:58:28.430 --> 00:58:31.610]
Little bird told us you placed your first order and they give you a bunch of other propaganda.

[00:58:32.010 --> 00:58:32.890]
But they're right on top of it.

[00:58:32.990 --> 00:58:33.830]
Amazon.com.

[00:58:34.450 --> 00:58:37.910]
And rather than going into about a dozen book stories trying to find this book by the

[00:58:38.350 --> 00:58:39.770]
investigative staff at the Boston Globe.

[00:58:39.770 --> 00:58:42.350]
It's called Be Trail Crisis in the Catholic Church.

[00:58:43.030 --> 00:58:44.110]
And I ordered it on there.

[00:58:44.110 --> 00:58:46.210]
I'll have it a couple of days right in my box.

[00:58:46.210 --> 00:58:49.850]
And it is very rare that you will find a better price for anything anywhere else.

[00:58:49.850 --> 00:58:50.090]
Right.

[00:58:50.330 --> 00:58:52.170]
They go out of their way to find you the best price.

[00:58:54.690 --> 00:58:56.050]
So what's not to lie, right?

[00:58:56.550 --> 00:58:56.550]

[00:58:57.870 --> 00:58:58.230]
WQAM.

[00:58:58.990 --> 00:59:01.230]
What happened to the pictures of the Beater Boy Sweepers?

[00:59:02.810 --> 00:59:03.350]
They're gone.

[00:59:04.210 --> 00:59:05.810]
They were replaced by the chicken.

[00:59:05.990 --> 00:59:08.470]
They were replaced by dancing mode.

[00:59:08.590 --> 00:59:09.170]
Don't be complaining.

[00:59:09.330 --> 00:59:09.530]
Okay.

[00:59:09.610 --> 00:59:10.310]
This is got to be.

[00:59:10.410 --> 00:59:10.410]

[00:59:10.570 --> 00:59:11.090]
That's for Beater Boy.

[00:59:12.070 --> 00:59:12.950]
That's old stuff.

[00:59:13.090 --> 00:59:13.290]
Okay.

[00:59:13.370 --> 00:59:14.030]
That's from last week.

[00:59:14.090 --> 00:59:15.810]
We're trying to put that behind us.

[00:59:15.870 --> 00:59:16.110]
Okay.

[00:59:16.110 --> 00:59:17.870]
We can look over the pictures page.

[00:59:18.910 --> 00:59:19.930]
They're on the pictures page.

[00:59:19.930 --> 00:59:20.410]
They're still there.

[00:59:20.670 --> 00:59:21.870]
Well, no, they will be.

[00:59:22.090 --> 00:59:23.570]
They will be on the pictures page.

[00:59:23.570 --> 00:59:25.370]
So just put it back in your pants and relax.

[00:59:25.570 --> 00:59:29.470]
And eventually you'll have more pictures of Beater Boy to get you all worked up on the

[00:59:29.470 --> 00:59:31.410]
boy with the mugshot pictures as soon as we get those.

[00:59:31.670 --> 00:59:31.910]
Great.

[00:59:32.410 --> 00:59:33.930]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[00:59:34.290 --> 00:59:38.430]
See no matter what you do, how can we possibly have a complaint on the day when we have the

[00:59:38.430 --> 00:59:40.390]
new dancing dwarf mode?

[00:59:40.710 --> 00:59:41.390]
Oh, they'll find a way.

[00:59:41.930 --> 00:59:42.750]
Oh my god.

[00:59:42.750 --> 00:59:44.670]
That's such a phenomenal thing.

[00:59:46.030 --> 00:59:47.590]
That could be the best thing we admit.

[00:59:47.770 --> 00:59:48.730]
Even better than Mozo.

[00:59:48.870 --> 00:59:49.810]
I don't care what anybody said.

[00:59:50.010 --> 00:59:50.770]
That's not seriously.

[00:59:51.390 --> 00:59:52.390]
This be the best.

[00:59:53.870 --> 00:59:54.670]
It's hypnotic.

[00:59:54.930 --> 00:59:55.670]
W-D-Q-A-M.

[00:59:56.430 --> 00:59:58.030]
So Henry's number is April and May.

[00:59:59.810 --> 01:00:00.510]
How big your pardon?

[01:00:01.130 --> 01:00:02.850]
So Henry's number is April and May.

[01:00:03.430 --> 01:00:04.230]
His rating is.

[01:00:04.310 --> 01:00:05.990]
Is that a statement or a question?

[01:00:06.950 --> 01:00:08.710]
What were his ratings for April and May?

[01:00:09.050 --> 01:00:10.530]
Phil Henry's number is for April and May.

[01:00:10.530 --> 01:00:16.910]
How about the George Washington Carver's numbers for 1872 and 1873 and a parkridge and

[01:00:16.910 --> 01:00:17.390]
a pear tree?

[01:00:17.470 --> 01:00:18.270]
That's the same guy.

[01:00:20.030 --> 01:00:21.250]
I'm going to tell you something, sir.

[01:00:21.390 --> 01:00:24.230]
We don't like to start a big song and dance with him, but we will send Gilbert to your

[01:00:24.230 --> 01:00:26.610]
house and we're like a little nap second.

[01:00:26.650 --> 01:00:27.170]
He won't leave.

[01:00:27.330 --> 01:00:28.010]
How do you like that?

[01:00:29.810 --> 01:00:31.110]
W-D-Q-A-M, line nine.

[01:00:31.190 --> 01:00:31.910]
It's always bad news.

[01:00:32.090 --> 01:00:32.210]
Hello?

[01:00:32.590 --> 01:00:33.110]
God bless.

[01:00:33.470 --> 01:00:34.610]
See, the toilet is bad news.

[01:00:34.810 --> 01:00:35.370]
It's line nine.

[01:00:36.170 --> 01:00:37.630]
You're going to have a great summer, George.

[01:00:37.810 --> 01:00:38.590]
I'm just going to be fine.

[01:00:38.970 --> 01:00:39.710]
I'm feeling it now.

[01:00:39.710 --> 01:00:41.050]
Can you feel it?

[01:00:41.110 --> 01:00:41.710]
Can you smell it?

[01:00:41.850 --> 01:00:42.710]
I can taste it.

[01:00:43.810 --> 01:00:44.570]
W-D-Q-A-M.

[01:00:44.830 --> 01:00:47.990]
David, retire and take that later with you.

[01:00:48.950 --> 01:00:49.970]
W-D-Q-A-M, hello.

[01:00:50.810 --> 01:00:51.070]
Hello?

[01:00:51.510 --> 01:00:51.790]
Yes, sir.

[01:00:52.470 --> 01:00:53.050]
Sounds like me.

[01:00:53.650 --> 01:00:55.110]
Hey, Neil, this is Victor.

[01:00:55.830 --> 01:00:56.270]
Hi, Victor.

[01:00:57.050 --> 01:00:58.230]
Listen to you, sure, quite often.

[01:00:58.370 --> 01:00:59.970]
How I get a first time calling in.

[01:01:00.570 --> 01:01:00.770]
Great.

[01:01:01.270 --> 01:01:02.430]
I had a question for you.

[01:01:03.370 --> 01:01:05.130]
Some family and others that I would discuss.

[01:01:05.890 --> 01:01:09.430]
Would you happen to know why New York City is called the Big Apple?

[01:01:09.810 --> 01:01:13.090]
I know you're a source of information and you might have the answer to that.

[01:01:13.150 --> 01:01:14.330]
Because it's rotten to the core.

[01:01:14.570 --> 01:01:16.030]
I really don't know, but somebody will know.

[01:01:16.090 --> 01:01:17.290]
Somebody will call in and tell us.

[01:01:17.810 --> 01:01:18.290]
Okay, great.

[01:01:18.910 --> 01:01:21.910]
Well, thanks for your input on that.

[01:01:21.970 --> 01:01:22.750]
Have a great day, Victor.

[01:01:23.230 --> 01:01:23.630]
Thank you, buddy.

[01:01:24.070 --> 01:01:24.210]
Okay.

[01:01:25.270 --> 01:01:26.430]
It's rotten to the core.

[01:01:26.690 --> 01:01:27.330]
I really don't know.

[01:01:27.410 --> 01:01:28.190]
Have you ever thought about that?

[01:01:28.250 --> 01:01:28.950]
Why it's called the Big Apple?

[01:01:29.210 --> 01:01:29.770]
No, not really.

[01:01:30.550 --> 01:01:32.170]
You got the Big Gohuna, the headhound,

[01:01:32.170 --> 01:01:35.550]
the big cheese, the big enchilada, all of these other clichés.

[01:01:35.630 --> 01:01:36.950]
Somebody will call in and tell us that.

[01:01:37.030 --> 01:01:38.130]
Probably somebody who's from New York.

[01:01:38.830 --> 01:01:41.830]
And let's hope that we get that over with early because we don't want to talk to too many New Yorkers.

[01:01:42.010 --> 01:01:43.650]
Now, especially like Richie from Borset.

[01:01:44.410 --> 01:01:45.870]
Well, Richie, you really are bad, man.

[01:01:45.970 --> 01:01:46.850]
You are one of the...

[01:01:46.850 --> 01:01:47.090]
Oh.

[01:01:48.870 --> 01:01:50.970]
You know, I guess it's just a category of people.

[01:01:51.110 --> 01:01:51.990]
The sports nerds, you know.

[01:01:52.710 --> 01:01:57.050]
The overgrown people are walking around with their horror cone outfits on and their little Yankee cats.

[01:01:57.290 --> 01:01:58.330]
Oh, you know.

[01:01:58.630 --> 01:01:59.970]
It's fine when you're like a little kid.

[01:02:00.930 --> 01:02:02.250]
Once you get to be a little bit older.

[01:02:02.510 --> 01:02:03.110]
Factor, man.

[01:02:03.290 --> 01:02:04.190]
At that point, you grow up.

[01:02:04.310 --> 01:02:05.810]
You try to grow up and say, okay, that was fine.

[01:02:05.910 --> 01:02:07.950]
Like, when I go to a ballgame, I'll put on some paraphernalia.

[01:02:08.130 --> 01:02:11.150]
But the rest of the time, I'll try to be like a real person, like an adult, you know what I'm saying?

[01:02:11.890 --> 01:02:12.050]
Oh.

[01:02:12.190 --> 01:02:12.850]
Not a QIM.

[01:02:14.850 --> 01:02:17.150]
11-13 at 5-60 WQM.

[01:02:17.150 --> 01:02:21.650]
If your mattress is lumpy and saggy and bumpy, forget about it because it's hurting your back and hurting your health.

[01:02:21.670 --> 01:02:23.290]
You don't feel good when you get out of bed in the morning.

[01:02:23.630 --> 01:02:24.770]
And that's why you need a great mattress.

[01:02:24.970 --> 01:02:25.410]
Where do you do it?

[01:02:25.450 --> 01:02:26.470]
You call dial amacres.

[01:02:26.470 --> 01:02:31.690]
Just like our good friend Moses has done and George has done and Miguel has done and I've been doing for years now.

[01:03:31.490 --> 01:03:35.630]
My, and local, this is Sports Real High City.

[01:03:36.150 --> 01:03:37.570]
Way to A.

[01:03:40.190 --> 01:03:46.130]
Oh Canada, you think that you're in luck.

[01:03:46.130 --> 01:03:49.610]
You stole our all-star game.

[01:03:49.790 --> 01:03:52.870]
Cause your own sports really suck.

[01:03:53.990 --> 01:03:55.590]
You got dog sled runs.

[01:03:56.070 --> 01:03:57.550]
You should moose with guns.

[01:03:57.730 --> 01:03:59.550]
What a way to entertain.

[01:04:01.210 --> 01:04:02.830]
And you fish for ice.

[01:04:03.210 --> 01:04:04.670]
You think hockey's nice.

[01:04:05.270 --> 01:04:07.850]
Cause it's played without a brain.

[01:04:08.830 --> 01:04:10.870]
Who a Canada?

[01:04:12.990 --> 01:04:14.870]
Who knows ya?

[01:04:16.470 --> 01:04:18.870]
Give me my all's all game.

[01:04:19.650 --> 01:04:21.050]
My wrongs.

[01:04:21.090 --> 01:04:23.150]
It's back now.

[01:04:23.670 --> 01:04:30.130]
Cause baseball in Canada makes me a blue child.

[01:04:32.170 --> 01:04:33.210]
How about some blue J tickets?

[01:04:33.410 --> 01:04:34.050]
Anybody want them?

[01:04:34.870 --> 01:04:36.890]
Love in 1905, 60 WDQM.

[01:04:36.970 --> 01:04:38.730]
This is a disgusting story, but typical.

[01:04:38.730 --> 01:04:40.330]
What we talking about religious nuts before.

[01:04:40.850 --> 01:04:42.850]
Crazy religious people, all that Armageddon bullshit.

[01:04:43.230 --> 01:04:44.690]
Wasting our taxpayer dollars.

[01:04:46.450 --> 01:04:48.530]
Frisk, backspan on game marriages.

[01:04:48.970 --> 01:04:50.190]
This is just amazing.

[01:04:50.470 --> 01:04:51.570]
Yeah, the right wingers are terrified.

[01:04:51.710 --> 01:04:53.670]
They're scared, Schmittless, after last week's Supreme Court ruling.

[01:04:54.910 --> 01:04:58.210]
Striking down those anti-sotomy laws in Texas and elsewhere.

[01:04:59.190 --> 01:05:03.430]
Set a majority leader Bill Frisk said yesterday he supported a proposed constitutional amendment

[01:05:03.430 --> 01:05:06.330]
to ban homosexual marriage in the United States.

[01:05:07.830 --> 01:05:09.730]
Get a Supreme Court ruling out of Panachean.

[01:05:09.810 --> 01:05:12.290]
Of course, here in Canada and other, making him crap in their boots.

[01:05:13.670 --> 01:05:22.170]
The Tennessee Republican said the Supreme Court decision last week on gay sex threatens to make the American home a place where criminality is condoned.

[01:05:23.370 --> 01:05:26.170]
Now, how stupid you have to be to believe this.

[01:05:26.550 --> 01:05:30.530]
How in the end or thought, how bigoted, how full of hate and sickness you have to be.

[01:05:30.750 --> 01:05:34.010]
Not only to believe something like this, but to actually say it in public about this much.

[01:05:35.470 --> 01:05:40.750]
I have this fear that the zone of privacy that we all want protected in our homes is gradually,

[01:05:41.110 --> 01:05:44.470]
or I'm concerned about the potential for it gradually being encroached upon,

[01:05:44.730 --> 01:05:49.070]
where criminal activity when the other home would in some way be condoned Frisk told ABCs this week.

[01:05:50.170 --> 01:05:54.450]
And I'm thinking of whether it's prostitution or illegal commercial drug activity in the home

[01:05:54.450 --> 01:05:58.490]
to have the courts come in in the zone of privacy and begin to define it gives me some concern.

[01:05:58.790 --> 01:06:00.890]
See, what he's failing to say is they've already done it.

[01:06:01.830 --> 01:06:06.510]
Previously, because the Sodomy Laws already did that, only they said that certain types of behavior were illegal.

[01:06:08.310 --> 01:06:10.390]
See, that was okay. He didn't have a problem with that.

[01:06:12.530 --> 01:06:16.430]
In addition to which, the Supreme Court ruling has got nothing to do with illegal activity.

[01:06:18.770 --> 01:06:23.330]
Asked whether we supported an amendment that would ban any marriage in the US except the union of a man and woman Frisk said,

[01:06:23.330 --> 01:06:27.370]
I absolutely do, of course I do. Yes, yes, yes, yay, yay.

[01:06:28.190 --> 01:06:31.610]
I very much feel that marriage is a sacrament and that sacrament should extend and can extend.

[01:06:31.850 --> 01:06:36.010]
Oh, by the way, you do understand that because the United States recognizes marriages in Canada,

[01:06:36.330 --> 01:06:40.450]
that all the fags that are coming up here and getting married, that they have to be recognized in the US,

[01:06:40.650 --> 01:06:41.390]
you do understand that.

[01:06:41.750 --> 01:06:42.390]
No, you do not.

[01:06:42.590 --> 01:06:42.990]
Now you do.

[01:06:44.430 --> 01:06:49.350]
Anyway, Frisk, you know, if you take the r-out in his name, what you got?

[01:06:51.010 --> 01:07:01.570]
I very much feel that marriage is a sacrament that sacrament should extend and can extend to that legal entity of a union between what is traditionally in our Western values has been defined as between a man and a woman so I would support the amendment.

[01:07:02.970 --> 01:07:10.030]
Same-sex marriages are legal in Belgium and Netherlands, Canada's Liberal government announced two weeks ago it would enact similar legislation soon in the entire country.

[01:07:10.410 --> 01:07:16.410]
Representative Marilyn Musgrave, Republican of Colorado, was the main sponsor they proposed to lawford May 21st to amend the Constitution.

[01:07:16.410 --> 01:07:23.690]
A constitutional amendment and a proposal says marriage in the US shall consist only of union of a man and a woman.

[01:07:24.050 --> 01:07:32.690]
Neither this Constitution nor the Constitution of any state under state or federal law shall be construed to require that marital status or the legal incidence thereof be conferred upon unmarried couples or groups.

[01:07:33.650 --> 01:07:39.610]
To be added to the Constitution, the proposal must be approved by two thirds of the House and Senate and ratified by three-fourths of the states.

[01:07:39.610 --> 01:07:44.830]
First said yesterday he respects the Supreme Court decision but feels that justice is overstep their bounds.

[01:07:45.330 --> 01:07:55.630]
Generally I think matters such as Sodom he should be addressed by the state legislatures he said that's where those decisions with the local norms, the local morays are being able to have their input reflected and that's where it should be decided not the court.

[01:07:55.970 --> 01:08:00.130]
This is a Nazi is what this is, okay? This is a card-carrying Nazi.

[01:08:01.710 --> 01:08:04.350]
Bill Frist, the Senate majority leader, a good Republican, okay?

[01:08:05.490 --> 01:08:14.110]
Should we decide it by the states? Just like the states should decide whether they want to discriminate whether the blacks, blacks, blacks, voters go to school, all of these things or be a rat be owned.

[01:08:15.730 --> 01:08:30.930]
I mean this is just an- this is amazing, the local norms and the local morays. In other words, if you're given a blowjob, if you're giving oral sex to somebody in Florida, that's different than doing it in Washington, state of Washington or in California or certainly then in Pennsylvania.

[01:08:32.290 --> 01:08:35.390]
Oh, much cheaper. Cost of third, man.

[01:08:36.110 --> 01:08:43.850]
I mean, just stop and think of the idiocy of these religious nut cases which of course he's a prime one of those. He's one of the real good ones. Religious nut.

[01:08:45.650 --> 01:08:54.330]
Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, the local norms and local morays. And again, that's that old states rights thing which used to be code for segregation and now it's code for discriminating against facts.

[01:08:54.330 --> 01:09:04.350]
Because once you take the facts away from that, what are these people going to have next? Who can be the next scapegoat, George? How about Hispanics? You guys haven't- you haven't had your turn yet? Well, I'm safe from a Cuban word Republicans remember.

[01:09:04.770 --> 01:09:18.970]
Oh, that's right. Well, Republicans, Hispanics aren't Republicans. Right. And the next group will be atheists and agnostics. Godless heathens. Here's the story from Bob and Bokka. Thank you. Bob, why is New York City called the Big Apple? You ask and we got it for you.

[01:09:20.430 --> 01:09:41.870]
This is by far the most frequently asked questions submitted to our New York history hotline it says here. In popular folklore, the name is usually traced to early jazz musicians or long-go sports figures, often the explanation of the so-called origin of this phrase is accompanied with plausible sounding historical or biographical details giving it an unmistakable but also totally spurious ring of truth.

[01:09:43.070 --> 01:09:52.770]
Because this question continues to have psych curiosity because the real facts are quite well known to serious historians. We provide the following authoritative account based on our unique archival sources. It says.

[01:09:53.990 --> 01:10:01.090]
The story may disappoint some readers truth after all is often less colorful and fiction, but these are the facts and it goes on for pages and pages, but I'll just read a little bit.

[01:10:02.370 --> 01:10:18.650]
In the early years of the 19th century, refugees from more torn Europe began arriving in New York and great numbers. Many were remnants of the crumbling print aristocracy forced to seek refuge aboard from abroad from the dread month senior months your guillotine. Did you know him? Oh, yeah.

[01:10:19.590 --> 01:10:32.010]
He had a sharp tongue. Arriving here without funds or friends many of these were forced to survive as one contemporary put it by their own wits or worse. One of these arriving in late 1803 or 1804 was Madame Waselle Evelyn Claudine de Saint-Everaume.

[01:10:32.610 --> 01:10:41.650]
The author of the noted career wit and literature and herself a favorite of Marie Antoinette Evelyn was by all accounts remarkably attracted beautiful vivacious well educated and was soon a society favorite.

[01:10:41.650 --> 01:10:52.030]
For reasons never disclosed over a planned marriage the following year to John Hamilton, son of the late Alexander Hamilton was called off at the last minute soon after with support from several highly placed admirers.

[01:10:52.170 --> 01:10:59.570]
She established a salon in fact appears to have been an eloquently furnished board, Delo in a substantial house that still stands at 142 bonds street.

[01:10:59.910 --> 01:11:09.770]
Then one of New York City's most exclusive residential districts. Evelyn's establishment quickly won and for several decades maintained a formidable reputation is the most entertain in the street of the city's many temples of love.

[01:11:09.770 --> 01:11:18.810]
A place not only for love making but also for elegant dinners high stakes gambling and witty conversation. The girls many of them fresh rivals from Paris or London were noted for their beauty and bearing.

[01:11:19.790 --> 01:11:34.030]
More than a few of them apparently were actually able to secure wealthy husbands from among the establishments clientele when New Yorkers insisted on anglicizing her name to Eve Evelyn apparently found the biblical reverence highly amusing and for her part will refer to the tempresses and her employees my irresistible apples.

[01:11:35.290 --> 01:11:40.370]
The young men about town soon got into the habit of referring to their amorous adventures and having a taste of Eve's apples.

[01:11:43.430 --> 01:11:52.750]
This knowing phrase established the speaker is one of the in crowd and at the same time made a clear he had no need to visit one of the coarser establishments that crowded nearby Mercer street for instance.

[01:11:53.130 --> 01:11:58.650]
The enigmatic reference in Philip Hohn's famous diary to Ida sweet is apple cider remember Ida sweet is apple cider.

[01:12:14.070 --> 01:12:20.490]
Ida sweet is apple cider. Ida spend the week inside Ida.

The radio's on your account.

[01:13:50.890 --> 01:13:51.970]
Ida sucks.

[01:13:54.470 --> 01:13:58.950]
Well my name is Gary Condon and I am living my worst beer.

[01:14:01.150 --> 01:14:05.310]
Because I banged one of my interns and she went and disappeared.

[01:14:07.870 --> 01:14:10.850]
Oh, Sean really worth some price.

[01:14:11.510 --> 01:14:18.090]
So when I told him come try and lie and I was often shown drunk, often heard said,

[01:14:27.490 --> 01:14:45.150]
We heard such a phrase, child drunk lookin and maybe I often got him sick on bad days to sober up about.

[01:14:45.970 --> 01:14:46.330]
Ida can I be there.

He's the best.

[01:14:54.970 --> 01:14:57.690]
398 votes already on a poll. That is a shocker. You know what?

[01:14:57.790 --> 01:14:59.130]
Especially considering there ain't nobody around.

[01:14:59.690 --> 01:15:01.250]
Look at that phone. Is there anybody on it?

[01:15:01.350 --> 01:15:03.190]
No. Is there anybody in town who doesn't have to do it?

[01:15:03.190 --> 01:15:03.710]
No. No.

[01:15:04.670 --> 01:15:07.050]
Like I said, George is going to be starting to show at 1134.

[01:15:08.470 --> 01:15:09.830]
You know, it was a little under the weather today.

[01:15:09.950 --> 01:15:11.750]
You need little practice. You need to break it in.

[01:15:11.950 --> 01:15:13.050]
You're, you know, it's been a while now.

[01:15:15.150 --> 01:15:17.330]
The last thing I want to hear on the near Roger show is,

[01:15:17.330 --> 01:15:19.110]
oh, you know what else we should have put on her? George!

[01:15:19.470 --> 01:15:21.490]
There you go. I thought you were going to do that, like, right now.

[01:15:21.490 --> 01:15:22.370]
If it wasn't going to do that,

[01:15:22.410 --> 01:15:24.470]
they would be just taking a retool to shot at you.

[01:15:24.770 --> 01:15:26.890]
And why didn't we do it? Because I forgot.

[01:15:27.330 --> 01:15:27.410]
Oh.

[01:15:29.130 --> 01:15:30.470]
Well, they enjoy doing that.

[01:15:30.730 --> 01:15:31.250]
Sure they do.

[01:15:31.590 --> 01:15:34.130]
It's like a nice outlet for those people who hate you like poison

[01:15:34.130 --> 01:15:35.170]
or at that many of them.

[01:15:36.270 --> 01:15:38.430]
You were thinking, hey, Beanaboy, you think we should add that on there?

[01:15:38.630 --> 01:15:39.730]
Last thing I want to hear is George.

[01:15:42.490 --> 01:15:44.030]
I've done enough to George in the last week.

[01:15:44.270 --> 01:15:45.050]
No, no, no, no, no.

[01:15:45.050 --> 01:15:47.070]
Let's see, if you're going to like start wimping out,

[01:15:47.390 --> 01:15:48.510]
set that all aside.

[01:15:48.650 --> 01:15:49.750]
This is a radio show now.

[01:15:49.910 --> 01:15:50.850]
Okay, the fact that you've made his,

[01:15:50.850 --> 01:15:52.990]
the fact that you made his life a living hell

[01:15:52.990 --> 01:15:55.710]
and that his pukin is guts out and sick as a dog today

[01:15:55.710 --> 01:15:59.110]
and got 16 different colors mucus coming from every orifice in his body.

[01:15:59.350 --> 01:16:01.370]
I mean, that is your fault, but that's not the question.

[01:16:02.370 --> 01:16:02.810]
But yeah.

[01:16:03.350 --> 01:16:04.010]
Okay, yeah.

[01:16:04.450 --> 01:16:05.810]
Yeah, let's put that on there, Eric.

[01:16:05.970 --> 01:16:07.670]
The last thing I want to hear on the near Roger show is,

[01:16:07.810 --> 01:16:10.210]
George, why not?

[01:16:10.670 --> 01:16:11.090]
Why not?

[01:16:11.870 --> 01:16:14.090]
Give him a whole week to get all whipped up to a frenzy.

[01:16:14.790 --> 01:16:18.130]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the 80.

[01:16:18.470 --> 01:16:20.250]
We don't have one person with any comment

[01:16:20.250 --> 01:16:21.350]
about once a time in America.

[01:16:21.690 --> 01:16:23.450]
And that's because they haven't seen once a pound of time in America,

[01:16:23.910 --> 01:16:24.790]
especially the new one.

[01:16:25.730 --> 01:16:28.610]
We had two calls on it, 28 days later,

[01:16:29.030 --> 01:16:31.410]
and they said later, they said it sucks.

[01:16:32.550 --> 01:16:33.270]
It blows.

[01:16:34.310 --> 01:16:36.390]
One guy actually got up and walked out of his so bad

[01:16:36.390 --> 01:16:37.230]
after just a few minutes.

[01:16:37.330 --> 01:16:38.470]
He said he couldn't take no mole.

[01:16:40.350 --> 01:16:41.710]
No more calls about that.

[01:16:42.510 --> 01:16:45.030]
No calls on Catherine Hepburn, and you want to know why?

[01:16:45.190 --> 01:16:47.010]
Because most of our audience don't even know who the hell that was.

[01:16:48.350 --> 01:16:51.810]
Do you think that anybody under 40 has any idea who Catherine Hepburn was?

[01:16:52.050 --> 01:16:53.710]
Even outside of that bit you played earlier?

[01:16:54.730 --> 01:16:55.630]
What do you mean by that?

[01:16:56.130 --> 01:16:57.490]
The Catherine Hepburn and Jimmy Stewart.

[01:16:57.730 --> 01:16:59.710]
They don't know who Jimmy Stewart was.

[01:16:59.930 --> 01:17:00.310]
Even if they're like,

[01:17:00.910 --> 01:17:02.030]
about 30 men.

[01:17:02.170 --> 01:17:02.590]
Or maybe not.

[01:17:02.750 --> 01:17:03.070]
I don't know.

[01:17:03.570 --> 01:17:05.830]
Do you think that 20-year-old people know who Jimmy Stewart was?

[01:17:06.170 --> 01:17:07.130]
Well, because of that movie.

[01:17:07.890 --> 01:17:09.730]
That Christmas thing.

[01:17:09.730 --> 01:17:10.990]
They show it every five minutes.

[01:17:10.990 --> 01:17:12.090]
Oh, geez.

[01:17:13.370 --> 01:17:14.490]
Wonderful life.

[01:17:16.230 --> 01:17:19.390]
But Kate Hepburn, she wasn't anything that younger people watch.

[01:17:19.990 --> 01:17:20.830]
I'm golden pond.

[01:17:21.050 --> 01:17:21.650]
Oh, like you said.

[01:17:21.650 --> 01:17:22.350]
Get out of here.

[01:17:22.530 --> 01:17:23.410]
I'm golden pond.

[01:17:23.710 --> 01:17:24.590]
I was a little far away.

[01:17:24.870 --> 01:17:26.710]
Henry Fonda was 110 in that movie.

[01:17:27.110 --> 01:17:27.630]
You kid me?

[01:17:28.090 --> 01:17:29.530]
Even Jane wouldn't go see it.

[01:17:30.690 --> 01:17:31.890]
I'm golden pond.

[01:17:32.390 --> 01:17:33.150]
The African Queen.

[01:17:33.670 --> 01:17:34.570]
What about him?

[01:17:35.390 --> 01:17:36.350]
Oh, you know it.

[01:17:36.890 --> 01:17:37.170]
Yeah.

[01:17:37.630 --> 01:17:38.350]
Johnny Mattress.

[01:17:38.350 --> 01:17:41.250]
She was in the African Queen.

[01:17:41.390 --> 01:17:41.710]
I forgot.

[01:17:41.850 --> 01:17:43.390]
I know Humphrey Bogart was in the African Queen.

[01:17:43.530 --> 01:17:43.730]
Right.

[01:17:44.250 --> 01:17:44.950]
I don't know.

[01:17:45.030 --> 01:17:47.130]
Those movies are so old and stale.

[01:17:47.370 --> 01:17:49.330]
There's some of those old movies that are still great.

[01:17:49.590 --> 01:17:50.190]
Like, canine mutiny.

[01:17:50.190 --> 01:17:51.090]
That's great.

[01:17:51.230 --> 01:17:52.310]
That will never age.

[01:17:52.630 --> 01:17:52.730]
Right.

[01:17:52.810 --> 01:17:56.830]
And again, nobody in this audience, I would say 95% this audience never saw it and doesn't

[01:17:56.830 --> 01:17:57.610]
even know what the hell it is.

[01:17:57.770 --> 01:17:58.810]
It's good in spider-pumpery.

[01:17:59.210 --> 01:18:00.670]
It's the Greg Reed story.

[01:18:02.330 --> 01:18:03.510]
Looking for the strawberries.

[01:18:03.770 --> 01:18:05.410]
He wants to know who I ate the strawberries.

[01:18:05.410 --> 01:18:10.810]
And he's rolling his balls in his hand, kind of like Moe.

[01:18:12.090 --> 01:18:13.090]
Rolling his giblets.

[01:18:13.710 --> 01:18:14.330]
It's a great movie.

[01:18:15.950 --> 01:18:17.530]
But nobody has any idea what it is.

[01:18:17.570 --> 01:18:17.990]
He doesn't mind.

[01:18:18.070 --> 01:18:18.850]
Of course, you do.

[01:18:19.050 --> 01:18:19.690]
I don't know why.

[01:18:21.190 --> 01:18:22.110]
Because it was good.

[01:18:23.310 --> 01:18:24.870]
Yeah, but why would you have encountered it?

[01:18:24.950 --> 01:18:26.750]
Why would you have seen it?

[01:18:26.850 --> 01:18:30.330]
Because once upon a time before cable, remember those days?

[01:18:31.310 --> 01:18:31.750]
No.

[01:18:32.250 --> 01:18:32.770]
Yes, I do.

[01:18:33.770 --> 01:18:35.550]
I remember howdy-duty, mister.

[01:18:35.830 --> 01:18:38.870]
I remember as a little kid when I used to go down the street every day because we didn't

[01:18:38.870 --> 01:18:39.870]
have our TV set yet.

[01:18:40.290 --> 01:18:43.810]
And there was a little girl down the street and her parents had the first TV set in the

[01:18:43.810 --> 01:18:43.990]
hood.

[01:18:44.990 --> 01:18:47.390]
And every afternoon, I think it was five or five thirty.

[01:18:47.490 --> 01:18:51.550]
I would go down there just like clockwork and sit down with this little punky girl and

[01:18:51.550 --> 01:18:52.790]
we would watch howdy-duty.

[01:18:53.390 --> 01:18:53.510]
Right.

[01:18:54.790 --> 01:19:00.790]
Well, on Saturday, on Channel 6, as a child, especially if it was really hot or raining

[01:19:00.790 --> 01:19:05.790]
which was any given Saturday, you had no choice but like after Tarzan, around Noonish,

[01:19:06.370 --> 01:19:09.490]
there was nothing but old movies on on Saturday afternoon on Channel 6.

[01:19:09.830 --> 01:19:13.190]
So you were a captive audience because all the other channels had-

[01:19:13.190 --> 01:19:14.690]
Did they have Saturday Indian boy?

[01:19:15.370 --> 01:19:16.510]
No, you better believe it.

[01:19:16.650 --> 01:19:17.790]
Every other week, practically.

[01:19:18.090 --> 01:19:19.070]
Every other channel had some sort of support.

[01:19:19.070 --> 01:19:20.930]
There was a support for Saturday Indian boy.

[01:19:21.290 --> 01:19:22.090]
He turned out to be a drunk.

[01:19:22.690 --> 01:19:22.830]
Maybe?

[01:19:22.950 --> 01:19:24.510]
No, yeah, he blew it in the morning.

[01:19:24.710 --> 01:19:26.870]
He made two movies, blew all his money on liquor and women.

[01:19:27.690 --> 01:19:33.330]
Because he was an actual like from the Boondocks Indian boy that they found under an elephant

[01:19:33.330 --> 01:19:37.330]
or something and gave him a job and he blew it all and drank and self-added or something

[01:19:37.330 --> 01:19:37.990]
like that.

[01:19:38.070 --> 01:19:39.510]
But every movie's on.

[01:19:39.550 --> 01:19:42.570]
Every one of the stories of all these Hollywood people has got so many people in this

[01:19:42.570 --> 01:19:43.730]
audience right now, jealous.

[01:19:44.090 --> 01:19:47.270]
They wish they had all the fame and the money in the notoriety and all the women and

[01:19:47.270 --> 01:19:48.130]
all the-whatever.

[01:19:48.350 --> 01:19:51.750]
And in the meantime, almost every story ends in tragedy.

[01:19:52.130 --> 01:19:55.930]
Whether it's Robert Blake, whether it's the three stooges.

[01:19:55.930 --> 01:19:56.670]
Absolutely.

[01:19:57.650 --> 01:20:03.250]
Up until yesterday, I never knew the name of the guy that operated the deli and had the

[01:20:03.250 --> 01:20:04.010]
head of the club.

[01:20:06.210 --> 01:20:09.370]
Back during prohibition, the deli and the club.

[01:20:09.710 --> 01:20:11.370]
In once upon a time in America.

[01:20:11.510 --> 01:20:12.330]
Oh, oh, oh.

[01:20:12.330 --> 01:20:13.510]
And his name was Fat Mo.

[01:20:14.110 --> 01:20:14.290]
Mo.

[01:20:14.570 --> 01:20:14.910]
Absolutely.

[01:20:15.230 --> 01:20:16.210]
I never knew that.

[01:20:16.350 --> 01:20:20.150]
You know, they're red-haired, they're real Jewish looking, uh, cherubic goofy guy.

[01:20:20.830 --> 01:20:24.310]
And I get the feeling there's a scene.

[01:20:24.310 --> 01:20:26.730]
I guess they show this because it's kind of like Momento.

[01:20:26.870 --> 01:20:28.650]
It's like all out of joint, the scenes are different.

[01:20:29.950 --> 01:20:33.390]
And there's a scene where Robert De Niro comes back, noodles, you know.

[01:20:33.950 --> 01:20:37.550]
And he comes back and he calls him from the phone booth across from the deli.

[01:20:38.390 --> 01:20:39.310]
The old hangout.

[01:20:39.910 --> 01:20:41.590]
And he tells him that he's there and he's coming in.

[01:20:41.670 --> 01:20:42.930]
So he kicks out the last customers.

[01:20:43.310 --> 01:20:47.630]
And then there's something that you really can't tell if it's a guy or it's, uh, like

[01:20:47.630 --> 01:20:48.010]
a trend.

[01:20:48.090 --> 01:20:48.990]
It's definitely not a woman.

[01:20:50.290 --> 01:20:51.090]
Do you know what I'm saying?

[01:20:51.750 --> 01:20:51.950]
Mm-hmm.

[01:20:52.030 --> 01:20:53.350]
It's either a guy or something in between.

[01:20:53.350 --> 01:20:58.230]
And Mo has, uh, Fat Mo has kicked everybody else out because he knows noodles is coming

[01:20:58.230 --> 01:20:58.690]
back in.

[01:20:58.870 --> 01:21:02.570]
But he's got this one character at the table and he takes some money and rolls it up in

[01:21:02.570 --> 01:21:06.090]
its hand and wishes it a good night and sends it out the door.

[01:21:06.850 --> 01:21:07.430]
Oh, I see.

[01:21:07.530 --> 01:21:11.770]
You get the feeling because we never see Fat Mo with any woman in the story.

[01:21:11.770 --> 01:21:14.430]
And of course everybody else in the group is just banging their brains out.

[01:21:14.650 --> 01:21:19.050]
So you get to think that Mo might be a little, you know, one of those, one of us, me, one

[01:21:19.050 --> 01:21:19.370]
of mine.

[01:21:20.390 --> 01:21:21.130]
Do you know what I'm saying?

[01:21:21.970 --> 01:21:22.330]
Jewish?

[01:21:22.330 --> 01:21:22.730]
What?

[01:21:22.970 --> 01:21:25.250]
A little Jewish like, right, like her friend Dave.

[01:21:26.690 --> 01:21:29.130]
5667-0560 boy, it's going to be a brutal summer, George.

[01:21:29.250 --> 01:21:31.030]
I don't want to get you nervous around like that here.

[01:21:31.150 --> 01:21:33.130]
I might want to consider a very serious illness right now.

[01:21:33.170 --> 01:21:33.950]
Might be something to think about.

[01:21:33.950 --> 01:21:34.510]
I'm working on that.

[01:21:34.810 --> 01:21:35.730]
20 till noon.

[01:21:35.870 --> 01:21:36.770]
Well, just talk to Beena Boy.

[01:21:36.870 --> 01:21:37.470]
He'll help you out.

[01:21:46.010 --> 01:21:46.870]
It's day.

[01:21:47.170 --> 01:21:53.310]
If I am a child at 566OWWQA.

[01:21:56.330 --> 01:22:01.470]
After miserable attempts at comedy and being a nice guy, Schwarzenegger's back as the

[01:22:01.470 --> 01:22:02.410]
re-gurgitator.

[01:22:02.650 --> 01:22:03.550]
Please, maggot.

[01:22:03.950 --> 01:22:05.630]
What you gonna do, man, in your big cute?

[01:22:06.570 --> 01:22:07.050]
Exactly.

[01:22:10.790 --> 01:22:12.430]
What's society enough, evil?

[01:22:12.710 --> 01:22:13.830]
Who else are you gonna throw it to?

[01:22:14.230 --> 01:22:16.070]
Oh, hell, he's getting away.

[01:22:16.570 --> 01:22:17.510]
I can't help you.

[01:22:17.810 --> 01:22:18.810]
Oh, yeah, try this.

[01:22:19.230 --> 01:22:20.630]
I scream in the shower, come on.

[01:22:20.630 --> 01:22:21.070]
I scream.

[01:22:22.250 --> 01:22:22.470]
I scream.

[01:22:25.410 --> 01:22:29.490]
Urging the forces of evil, Schwarzenegger is re-gurgitator.

[01:22:30.550 --> 01:22:31.430]
He does it for me.

[01:22:31.570 --> 01:22:33.590]
16 till noon at 566OWWQA.

[01:22:33.790 --> 01:22:36.710]
Catherine Hepburn said she was 96 and I think she was overrated.

[01:22:37.990 --> 01:22:38.350]
Yeah.

[01:22:39.590 --> 01:22:41.090]
I'm just expressing that opinion.

[01:22:41.230 --> 01:22:44.290]
That's supposed to say that when somebody thought I just thinks she was overrated.

[01:22:44.410 --> 01:22:45.710]
She was okay.

[01:22:45.890 --> 01:22:48.430]
She did a lot of stuff and she was, you know, she was okay.

[01:22:48.470 --> 01:22:49.690]
She was coming from the right place.

[01:22:50.790 --> 01:22:52.730]
Just like Spencer Tracy.

[01:22:53.010 --> 01:22:54.210]
I think he was highly overrated.

[01:22:54.850 --> 01:22:55.790]
He was always the same.

[01:22:55.910 --> 01:22:57.030]
He was always the same.

[01:22:57.570 --> 01:22:59.170]
He was always Spencer Tracy.

[01:23:00.470 --> 01:23:04.570]
In fact, the Spencer Tracy and guess who's coming to dinner, every movie that I ever saw

[01:23:04.570 --> 01:23:09.230]
him and including Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Dr. Jik and Mr. Dave Hyde, was the same.

[01:23:11.070 --> 01:23:12.750]
How many times have I said that this year?

[01:23:13.050 --> 01:23:13.650]
3rd man.

[01:23:13.830 --> 01:23:14.470]
And I'll say it again.

[01:23:14.730 --> 01:23:15.290]
Always the same.

[01:23:16.730 --> 01:23:20.350]
I mean, a great actor, somebody like Marlon Brando, for example, was he the same and

[01:23:20.350 --> 01:23:22.270]
a godfather as he was in, say, on a waterfront?

[01:23:22.370 --> 01:23:23.090]
No, of course not.

[01:23:24.210 --> 01:23:28.490]
He too many movies he was ever the same and was the one with Matthew Broderick and that

[01:23:28.490 --> 01:23:30.470]
was because that was a spoof of the godfather.

[01:23:30.570 --> 01:23:31.150]
What was the name of that?

[01:23:33.050 --> 01:23:34.170]
The first person.

[01:23:34.170 --> 01:23:34.430]
First person.

[01:23:35.450 --> 01:23:36.730]
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

[01:23:37.190 --> 01:23:39.430]
Boy, you see when you least expect it, boys.

[01:23:40.650 --> 01:23:41.610]
George is out of the weather.

[01:23:41.610 --> 01:23:43.630]
So he's a little bit behind, of course, being a boy.

[01:23:43.790 --> 01:23:48.230]
He's had an incredibly stressful couple of weeks here, which that definitely is coming

[01:23:48.230 --> 01:23:50.650]
to an end very soon, like at this moment.

[01:23:51.870 --> 01:23:53.010]
That's what inspired me, boy.

[01:23:53.130 --> 01:23:57.010]
I think an active genius came out of him when he got that dancing dwarf, Moe, on there.

[01:23:58.330 --> 01:24:00.010]
I would, this lack of calls here, then.

[01:24:00.110 --> 01:24:02.810]
I'm just tempted to sit here and stare at that and laugh the whole rest of the show.

[01:24:03.050 --> 01:24:04.370]
Although you notice how well we've done this.

[01:24:04.430 --> 01:24:05.270]
It's almost noon already.

[01:24:05.730 --> 01:24:05.890]
Right.

[01:24:06.410 --> 01:24:08.950]
How many calls have we had here, about three or four?

[01:24:09.130 --> 01:24:10.370]
Well, maybe one or two real one.

[01:24:10.410 --> 01:24:11.990]
It's only seemed like five hours since I said that.

[01:24:11.990 --> 01:24:12.650]
No, it has not.

[01:24:12.810 --> 01:24:14.150]
It's gone by tremendously fast.

[01:24:14.670 --> 01:24:15.730]
437 votes on the pool.

[01:24:15.870 --> 01:24:16.690]
So somebody's out there.

[01:24:17.090 --> 01:24:17.690]
Somebody's out there.

[01:24:17.730 --> 01:24:18.810]
Greg, ah, let me just say this.

[01:24:19.450 --> 01:24:24.450]
I don't want to like start, start something like Butch Boss, but I think seriously, I think

[01:24:24.450 --> 01:24:28.250]
that the way we've been jerked around here last couple of weeks with all the respect

[01:24:28.250 --> 01:24:29.790]
to Farrell and anybody else.

[01:24:30.310 --> 01:24:31.990]
This isn't some kind of a game.

[01:24:32.530 --> 01:24:36.330]
This show, this show has been like the centerpiece on this radio station for five and a half

[01:24:36.330 --> 01:24:36.510]
years.

[01:24:36.630 --> 01:24:37.870]
We finally got our time back.

[01:24:38.110 --> 01:24:40.990]
So we thank Farrell for that and whoever made that decision.

[01:24:42.410 --> 01:24:44.730]
But we've been doing things how many years now?

[01:24:45.150 --> 01:24:47.730]
We've done it all five years or did we do best of the first year?

[01:24:47.730 --> 01:24:49.710]
I think the very first year I've had you do the summer, right?

[01:24:49.950 --> 01:24:52.110]
I think it was best of this first year, but I forget.

[01:24:52.690 --> 01:24:53.530]
It's been four years.

[01:24:54.330 --> 01:24:54.550]
Okay.

[01:24:54.870 --> 01:24:56.170]
So for four years, we've done.

[01:24:56.190 --> 01:25:01.350]
And granted, George has got his detractors out there, including me, but the fact that

[01:25:01.350 --> 01:25:05.250]
a matter is we've done pretty damn well in the summertime and it's a low budget operation.

[01:25:05.250 --> 01:25:07.950]
He makes basically the same crappy money that he does the rest of the year.

[01:25:08.370 --> 01:25:09.230]
And the life goes on.

[01:25:09.310 --> 01:25:10.330]
There's nobody in town anyway.

[01:25:12.050 --> 01:25:15.450]
But I think that to keep yank at our chain and duck comes in there, woman, it tells

[01:25:15.450 --> 01:25:18.190]
me one thing and then he comes in here while I'm on the year in the middle of the show

[01:25:18.190 --> 01:25:20.390]
and tells you another, we're not playing that game anymore.

[01:25:20.730 --> 01:25:20.830]
Okay.

[01:25:21.090 --> 01:25:21.750]
We're not doing that.

[01:25:22.410 --> 01:25:22.830]
We're not?

[01:25:23.310 --> 01:25:24.010]
No, we're not.

[01:25:25.590 --> 01:25:27.810]
I'm not tolerating that crap.

[01:25:27.990 --> 01:25:30.890]
In other words, it's a week before you start on that day.

[01:25:30.950 --> 01:25:33.870]
And if they haven't got their act together, in addition to which, what's the reason for

[01:25:33.870 --> 01:25:34.110]
that?

[01:25:34.630 --> 01:25:35.850]
Well, what's the point in that?

[01:25:36.090 --> 01:25:37.610]
You know, like, like you don't know.

[01:25:38.030 --> 01:25:41.630]
It was all based on somebody else sticking their nose in where it doesn't belong and

[01:25:41.630 --> 01:25:42.910]
like injecting themselves.

[01:25:43.190 --> 01:25:44.190]
We don't need any injection.

[01:25:44.190 --> 01:25:44.530]
Okay.

[01:25:44.690 --> 01:25:46.250]
Well, the motorbike continue just fine.

[01:25:46.970 --> 01:25:49.990]
And if you do a little bit of a cross over there every day, like we've been doing, that's

[01:25:49.990 --> 01:25:50.230]
great.

[01:25:50.450 --> 01:25:51.290]
That's all we need.

[01:25:52.610 --> 01:25:54.290]
We can handle it.

[01:25:54.370 --> 01:25:58.630]
It's kind of like when Moe came in the picture, which was a sad, sad, I apologize.

[01:25:58.850 --> 01:26:03.110]
I hate to use that analogy, but there were things that were said, oh, what did he ever

[01:26:03.110 --> 01:26:04.590]
have to talk about before I came along?

[01:26:04.890 --> 01:26:09.250]
As if somehow, until Moe Howard David, it was inflicted on this radio station, all the

[01:26:09.250 --> 01:26:11.230]
other 26 years I didn't market before then.

[01:26:11.230 --> 01:26:14.430]
I must never have had any material right thing to talk about because that's all he talks

[01:26:14.430 --> 01:26:15.350]
about is Moe Howard David.

[01:26:15.590 --> 01:26:16.770]
Well, it's good to hear you admit it.

[01:26:17.210 --> 01:26:17.930]
Yeah, you're right.

[01:26:18.410 --> 01:26:19.030]
Am I right?

[01:26:19.170 --> 01:26:19.530]
Absolutely.

[01:26:19.930 --> 01:26:21.490]
Thanks, Moe.

[01:26:22.350 --> 01:26:23.450]
It's the same thing.

[01:26:24.050 --> 01:26:24.870]
We'll get by.

[01:26:26.110 --> 01:26:28.930]
You know, it's like the old toe in and one toe out.

[01:26:29.050 --> 01:26:29.890]
You know, am I in the closet?

[01:26:29.890 --> 01:26:30.810]
Am I out of the closet?

[01:26:30.870 --> 01:26:31.370]
Am I in this?

[01:26:31.550 --> 01:26:31.870]
Am I in that?

[01:26:32.430 --> 01:26:33.310]
Now how are that?

[01:26:33.890 --> 01:26:36.490]
We're going to proceed the way we always proceed on this show.

[01:26:38.410 --> 01:26:39.670]
Jesus, God Almighty.

[01:26:39.670 --> 01:26:40.990]
Well, it's still out of Dundee.

[01:26:41.350 --> 01:26:45.390]
I just, I've just been worn out on that whole equivocating crap that was on under radio

[01:26:45.390 --> 01:26:45.690]
station.

[01:26:45.890 --> 01:26:50.510]
The only thing that I've ever seen in the Mac fast was this thing when it put for all

[01:26:50.510 --> 01:26:52.010]
on 8 to 10 and got me back 10 to 2.

[01:26:52.150 --> 01:26:53.930]
And I'm glad because they might have changed their mind.

[01:26:54.070 --> 01:26:56.430]
That's the only time I've ever seen the Mac swiftly.

[01:26:58.190 --> 01:27:03.730]
But generally, everything else is this long, drawn out, convoluted process.

[01:27:04.210 --> 01:27:08.870]
And it depends on how Greg felt when he got out of bed this morning and how many B.M.

[01:27:09.970 --> 01:27:14.790]
baked beans he had for dinner over the weekend and how many little green men they found

[01:27:14.790 --> 01:27:17.830]
crawling around inside the spectrum parts.

[01:27:18.630 --> 01:27:19.590]
And enough for that.

[01:27:19.830 --> 01:27:20.910]
You know, we're just going to proceed.

[01:27:21.010 --> 01:27:23.550]
Georgia beyond starting next week, Monday, Wednesday and Friday.

[01:27:23.710 --> 01:27:25.730]
I'll be doing Tuesday and Thursday, July and most of August.

[01:27:26.030 --> 01:27:28.010]
Just like we have last couple of years and life will go on.

[01:27:28.130 --> 01:27:28.290]
Period.

[01:27:28.370 --> 01:27:28.690]
That's it.

[01:27:30.330 --> 01:27:30.930]
That's the fact.

[01:27:31.090 --> 01:27:31.950]
That's a statement of fact.

[01:27:32.090 --> 01:27:32.910]
It's not negotiable.

[01:27:32.990 --> 01:27:33.670]
It's not going to change.

[01:27:33.950 --> 01:27:34.570]
That's it, muff.

[01:27:35.150 --> 01:27:36.150]
Like it or lump it, okay?

[01:27:36.630 --> 01:27:37.770]
And don't come back to me again tomorrow.

[01:27:37.770 --> 01:27:41.170]
I'm going to say, wow, they had another meeting and forget about it.

[01:27:41.250 --> 01:27:44.370]
Let them have other meetings having to do with other shows on a radio station, not with

[01:27:44.370 --> 01:27:44.670]
this one.

[01:27:45.950 --> 01:27:47.530]
They're using us as like a play toy.

[01:27:47.710 --> 01:27:48.170]
Do you see what I'm saying?

[01:27:48.510 --> 01:27:50.370]
Yeah, and screw them.

[01:27:52.130 --> 01:27:54.950]
I mean, I don't want to be given away Marlon tickets on this show.

[01:27:55.290 --> 01:27:55.790]
Follow my drift.

[01:27:55.950 --> 01:27:56.910]
I don't want to be doing that.

[01:27:58.230 --> 01:27:58.490]
Okay.

[01:27:58.750 --> 01:27:59.970]
If you want Marlon ticket line, hello.

[01:28:00.650 --> 01:28:01.010]
Neil.

[01:28:01.430 --> 01:28:01.770]
Yes, sir.

[01:28:02.070 --> 01:28:02.910]
Let me turn on the radio.

[01:28:03.830 --> 01:28:04.390]
Happy Monday.

[01:28:04.870 --> 01:28:05.390]
Back to you.

[01:28:05.990 --> 01:28:06.590]
Back it.

[01:28:07.150 --> 01:28:07.510]
Okay.

[01:28:07.510 --> 01:28:07.870]
Good one.

[01:28:08.030 --> 01:28:08.770]
What do you want?

[01:28:09.310 --> 01:28:09.430]
Huh?

[01:28:10.950 --> 01:28:12.610]
I think you're putting it out of the bag.

[01:28:13.650 --> 01:28:18.310]
The last thing I want to hear about on the Roger Show is we got 452 votes.

[01:28:18.510 --> 01:28:19.370]
Sports 109.

[01:28:20.310 --> 01:28:22.370]
Eating ass has moved up into second place.

[01:28:22.370 --> 01:28:23.230]
George 88.

[01:28:23.910 --> 01:28:24.670]
Hockey 78.

[01:28:25.070 --> 01:28:26.250]
Mohawar David at 54.

[01:28:26.810 --> 01:28:27.710]
Music 32.

[01:28:28.270 --> 01:28:29.150]
Politics 29.

[01:28:29.530 --> 01:28:31.370]
I see Mohawar David is like almost 12%.

[01:28:31.370 --> 01:28:32.710]
Everything else is under 10%.

[01:28:32.710 --> 01:28:35.070]
If it's under 10%, I'm assuming it ain't too bad.

[01:28:35.070 --> 01:28:36.410]
Politics 29.

[01:28:37.350 --> 01:28:38.430]
Movies only 25.

[01:28:38.570 --> 01:28:39.730]
That's only 5.5%.

[01:28:39.730 --> 01:28:40.850]
Religion 16.

[01:28:41.410 --> 01:28:43.330]
QAM Interoff is politics 13.

[01:28:43.750 --> 01:28:44.870]
And George has already got 8.

[01:28:44.910 --> 01:28:45.330]
You only got 8.

[01:28:45.330 --> 01:28:45.870]
You only got 8.

[01:28:45.870 --> 01:28:46.370]
A few seconds.

[01:28:46.710 --> 01:28:46.930]
30.

[01:28:47.210 --> 01:28:48.070]
Everybody got 8 votes.

[01:28:48.270 --> 01:28:48.950]
Wait till I get home.

[01:28:50.770 --> 01:28:52.290]
It's going to beat up your wife just out of frustration.

[01:28:52.310 --> 01:28:53.650]
I'm going to creep the poll.

[01:28:54.350 --> 01:28:55.110]
Oh, for me.

[01:28:56.010 --> 01:28:58.210]
Now you see the result on this move on dot org thing.

[01:28:58.430 --> 01:28:59.770]
No, you were teased about that.

[01:28:59.990 --> 01:29:00.450]
Oh, why?

[01:29:00.910 --> 01:29:01.810]
It's almost noon.

[01:29:01.810 --> 01:29:02.850]
I haven't even done this yet.

[01:29:02.930 --> 01:29:04.010]
See I'm holding back the VISTA.

[01:29:04.010 --> 01:29:04.610]
You know how.

[01:29:04.610 --> 01:29:07.810]
Because with the tremendous quality of calls we have here today, I know what the hell I'm

[01:29:07.810 --> 01:29:08.170]
doing here.

[01:29:08.430 --> 01:29:09.110]
I know what's going on.

[01:29:09.730 --> 01:29:11.730]
And let me say it again, Muftel, Greg, to bug out.

[01:29:11.830 --> 01:29:13.310]
Okay, we don't have a problem here.

[01:29:13.410 --> 01:29:13.970]
We're doing just fine.

[01:29:14.250 --> 01:29:16.690]
Now that we got our 10 to 2 back and we got to leave it, that's all we want.

[01:29:17.510 --> 01:29:20.470]
Don't be starting to like stick other testicles and tentacles into the program.

[01:29:20.770 --> 01:29:21.990]
George will handle it just great.

[01:29:22.270 --> 01:29:23.790]
Well, in his own way.

[01:29:24.850 --> 01:29:25.170]
Right?

[01:29:25.490 --> 01:29:26.270]
I'll this handle it.

[01:29:26.790 --> 01:29:27.370]
It's fine.

[01:29:27.910 --> 01:29:28.490]
Threat the ball.

[01:29:28.690 --> 01:29:29.570]
Bounce it around a couple of times.

[01:29:29.570 --> 01:29:30.070]
They'll like it.

[01:29:30.110 --> 01:29:31.090]
They'll think it's a sports show.

[01:29:32.730 --> 01:29:34.390]
So anyway, move on.org.

[01:29:34.590 --> 01:29:36.050]
We had that Make Believe primary.

[01:29:36.250 --> 01:29:37.190]
And I will say this.

[01:29:37.530 --> 01:29:41.510]
They chose the same week that Howard Dean officially announced his candidacy earlier

[01:29:41.510 --> 01:29:41.990]
in the week.

[01:29:42.330 --> 01:29:48.150]
And also number two, two of the move on organizers of this outfit are big Howard Dean supporters.

[01:29:48.510 --> 01:29:50.270]
So there is a slant.

[01:29:50.710 --> 01:29:53.530]
But I thought the result was pretty interesting.

[01:29:54.150 --> 01:30:00.470]
In a little over 48 hours, 317,647 members voted making the vote larger than both the New

[01:30:00.470 --> 01:30:03.310]
Hampshire Democratic primary and Iowa caucuses combined.

[01:30:03.870 --> 01:30:05.490]
So it does have some significance.

[01:30:05.670 --> 01:30:05.870]
Okay.

[01:30:06.150 --> 01:30:07.610]
Over 317,000 votes.

[01:30:08.990 --> 01:30:13.250]
Former from October or Howard Dean 43.87% 139,000 votes.

[01:30:14.050 --> 01:30:14.630]
44%.

[01:30:15.630 --> 01:30:19.790]
Dennis Cassin is 24% with a bad herpes, but with a good mouth and a good mind.

[01:30:20.970 --> 01:30:24.490]
John Kerry 15.73%.

[01:30:25.150 --> 01:30:26.350]
You following these numbers?

[01:30:26.650 --> 01:30:27.710]
Kerry was third.

[01:30:29.110 --> 01:30:30.750]
Fourth was Edwards.

[01:30:30.810 --> 01:30:34.650]
John Edwards from your friends in Carolina 3.19% not much.

[01:30:35.030 --> 01:30:36.690]
I mean, what's small potatoes after Kerry?

[01:30:37.910 --> 01:30:42.290]
After that, Dick Ebbhart 2.44% Mr. Personality.

[01:30:42.670 --> 01:30:46.890]
Our own Bobby Graham only had 2.24% 71.13% and two of those votes were ours.

[01:30:47.730 --> 01:30:53.550]
Carol mostly brawn 2.21% so he just barely beat her out and she even lost her election

[01:30:53.550 --> 01:30:54.450]
to the re-lection of the Senate.

[01:30:55.710 --> 01:31:03.630]
Some of the good news, Julie Lieberman had only 1.92% and Al Sharpton 0.53%.

[01:31:04.330 --> 01:31:05.210]
You ready for that?

[01:31:07.230 --> 01:31:09.550]
That's better than some sports station ratings.

[01:31:10.630 --> 01:31:12.450]
Yeah, like you mean the big O.

[01:31:12.970 --> 01:31:17.910]
Let me say to you and Julie Lieberman had only 6,095 votes 1.92% and yet in spite of

[01:31:17.910 --> 01:31:20.450]
that, all these people, well, Carol Lieberman is one of the front-runners.

[01:31:20.470 --> 01:31:20.850]
No, he's not.

[01:31:21.290 --> 01:31:21.950]
No, he's not.

[01:31:21.950 --> 01:31:25.550]
He's not the fact that he's as far to the right as this administration and he's not

[01:31:25.550 --> 01:31:29.270]
the fact that he's an orthodox Jew that nobody in and I'm not case and a hawk other than

[01:31:29.270 --> 01:31:30.330]
that nobody likes him anyway.

[01:31:33.150 --> 01:31:36.730]
But poor Bobby Graham, see Bob Graham isn't known out of Florida, out of the South.

[01:31:37.070 --> 01:31:40.470]
In fact, he may not even be known just even out of the state, much less the South.

[01:31:41.170 --> 01:31:41.990]
Well, at the day of shining.

[01:31:42.630 --> 01:31:46.430]
Yeah, it's a damn shame because we voted for him on an also he's a very bad speaker.

[01:31:46.630 --> 01:31:49.330]
I mean, you know, I'm not taking anything away from him.

[01:31:49.330 --> 01:31:50.350]
I just tell you the way it is.

[01:31:50.990 --> 01:31:54.130]
General Wesley Clark didn't have any votes, but I did put over the weekend on our website

[01:31:54.130 --> 01:31:57.930]
a story to passify that one luck job about how Clinton says that Clark would make a good

[01:31:57.930 --> 01:31:58.270]
present.

[01:31:59.550 --> 01:32:00.350]
Aren't you proud of me?

[01:32:00.990 --> 01:32:01.170]
Quite.

[01:32:01.610 --> 01:32:04.930]
Just to passify because if you could have seen how great he was on meat the press couple

[01:32:04.930 --> 01:32:07.530]
weeks ago, you'd have been very impressed.

[01:32:07.870 --> 01:32:13.570]
What's your five six seven O five 60 pound five 60 on a AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line.

[01:32:13.850 --> 01:32:15.610]
I hope some of our people voted on that thing.

[01:32:15.650 --> 01:32:16.450]
I move on to work.

[01:32:16.890 --> 01:32:17.510]
Probably a bunch.

[01:32:18.450 --> 01:32:20.370]
I'm not too many WQ I am.

[01:32:20.790 --> 01:32:21.930]
Yeah, I want to go on with Neil.

[01:32:22.550 --> 01:32:23.010]
I beg your pardon.

[01:32:23.450 --> 01:32:24.550]
I wanted to get on with Neil.

[01:32:24.810 --> 01:32:25.590]
You're on right now, sir.

[01:32:25.690 --> 01:32:26.130]
How are you?

[01:32:26.290 --> 01:32:26.530]
What's that?

[01:32:27.250 --> 01:32:27.810]
I said, how are you doing?

[01:32:28.530 --> 01:32:28.990]
Oh, I'm good.

[01:32:29.150 --> 01:32:29.350]
I'm good.

[01:32:29.490 --> 01:32:32.010]
I just wanted to see if I could add something to the list.

[01:32:32.570 --> 01:32:32.750]
Yeah.

[01:32:33.150 --> 01:32:37.310]
I was hoping I can't believe it hasn't mentioned yet, but it hasn't mentioned yet.

[01:32:37.350 --> 01:32:39.530]
I want to hear on your show is callers.

[01:32:39.690 --> 01:32:41.470]
My God, they're horrendous.

[01:32:41.850 --> 01:32:47.110]
It's like a terrible, terrible insult to the intelligence of you and everyone you talk

[01:32:47.110 --> 01:32:47.350]
to.

[01:32:47.550 --> 01:32:48.210]
That is correct.

[01:32:48.430 --> 01:32:50.050]
I just can't believe it hasn't mentioned yet.

[01:32:50.170 --> 01:32:50.890]
That's about all I got.

[01:32:50.970 --> 01:32:54.150]
We're going to add it just in your honor, sir, because you're absolutely correct.

[01:32:54.250 --> 01:32:54.750]
Thank you very much.

[01:32:54.890 --> 01:32:55.390]
Hey, no problem.

[01:32:55.430 --> 01:32:55.910]
Have a good day, buddy.

[01:32:56.130 --> 01:32:56.390]
You too.

[01:32:56.630 --> 01:32:59.210]
See, now he was an exception because he started articulate and brightening.

[01:32:59.410 --> 01:33:01.890]
He didn't call to have a conversation or be one of those wise guys.

[01:33:02.010 --> 01:33:03.650]
He just called to make an observant point.

[01:33:03.770 --> 01:33:04.050]
He's right.

[01:33:04.230 --> 01:33:05.970]
Let's put that on there right away, Eric.

[01:33:06.410 --> 01:33:06.730]
Cawers.

[01:33:07.390 --> 01:33:09.090]
See, this is a list that could be added to.

[01:33:09.150 --> 01:33:10.030]
There's no problem with that.

[01:33:10.270 --> 01:33:10.390]
Nope.

[01:33:10.650 --> 01:33:13.770]
We added on your name just to give him a chance to take a cheap shot with the enjoyed

[01:33:13.770 --> 01:33:15.930]
tremendously, especially when you're on a butt end.

[01:33:17.770 --> 01:33:19.090]
Good thing you're not a hockey player.

[01:33:19.090 --> 01:33:19.990]
You get a lot of butt ends.

[01:33:20.030 --> 01:33:20.670]
I'll guarantee you that.

[01:33:20.970 --> 01:33:21.670]
I play roller hockey.

[01:33:22.110 --> 01:33:23.190]
Good thing you don't hang out with clearance.

[01:33:23.390 --> 01:33:25.630]
I guarantee you don't get a butt end every time you turn around.

[01:33:25.730 --> 01:33:26.610]
He'd be on all fours.

[01:33:26.770 --> 01:33:28.110]
I have protective gear just for that.

[01:33:28.870 --> 01:33:29.230]
Clarence?

[01:33:30.070 --> 01:33:30.430]
Yes.

[01:33:32.310 --> 01:33:35.230]
So anyway, Beener, when you went out in the hallway before, what was Clarence listening

[01:33:35.230 --> 01:33:35.430]
to?

[01:33:36.670 --> 01:33:38.890]
He actually had the radio off because stuff was in there.

[01:33:39.430 --> 01:33:41.930]
But as I walked out, he turned it on and it was your show.

[01:33:42.410 --> 01:33:43.130]
Get out of here.

[01:33:43.490 --> 01:33:44.850]
Clarence is listening to the show.

[01:33:45.330 --> 01:33:46.130]
Just in case.

[01:33:46.510 --> 01:33:46.870]
Monitoring.

[01:33:47.050 --> 01:33:48.930]
Just in case we bring him out of the closet today.

[01:33:49.090 --> 01:33:49.630]
Today's the day.

[01:33:49.770 --> 01:33:51.730]
Well, listen, we just had the big gay pride weekend.

[01:33:51.910 --> 01:33:52.970]
Clarence wants to make an official.

[01:33:53.390 --> 01:33:54.050]
That, Clarence.

[01:33:54.050 --> 01:33:57.730]
In fact, I was sworn I saw his twin on Youngstreet yesterday and they have big parade

[01:33:59.210 --> 01:34:00.770]
with a big bow on his navel.

[01:34:01.470 --> 01:34:02.070]
Big pink bow.

[01:34:02.250 --> 01:34:02.810]
He's a lovely thing.

[01:34:04.110 --> 01:34:07.150]
And actually, if you look at those pictures, remember a minute ago when I was talking

[01:34:07.150 --> 01:34:11.210]
about dancing dwarf moe, the other pictures on there like like the moe raping me.

[01:34:11.330 --> 01:34:13.410]
His, I mean, it's not really a very good cut out.

[01:34:13.410 --> 01:34:14.590]
I must say, no, it's amusing.

[01:34:14.790 --> 01:34:15.070]
It's great.

[01:34:15.230 --> 01:34:15.950]
He's very energetic.

[01:34:16.430 --> 01:34:21.530]
But if you, the one picture that most realistic besides dancing dwarf moe is the one

[01:34:21.530 --> 01:34:23.550]
of clearance in the beast, right?

[01:34:23.950 --> 01:34:24.290]
Am I right?

[01:34:24.550 --> 01:34:26.270]
The heads actually look like they're on a body.

[01:34:26.390 --> 01:34:29.050]
Now, that might have been the beast about a hundred pounds ago, right?

[01:34:30.250 --> 01:34:30.470]
Yeah.

[01:34:30.790 --> 01:34:36.230]
And if you, if you work out lovely and girlish, Clarence looks in that picture.

[01:34:36.330 --> 01:34:39.130]
I'm telling you, he looks just like he's going to float away any second.

[01:34:41.330 --> 01:34:43.370]
And you know what they say about those sports nerds, huh?

[01:34:43.450 --> 01:34:44.470]
The guy, the jock sniffers?

[01:34:44.810 --> 01:34:49.610]
No, but you know, love him 57 at 560 WQ.

[01:34:49.610 --> 01:34:52.070]
And we got the fourth of July coming up this week, Friday.

[01:34:52.590 --> 01:34:53.870]
Oh, it is Friday in it.

[01:34:54.050 --> 01:34:56.750]
Yeah, this Friday, like I said, and my mother's birthday on Saturday.

[01:34:56.790 --> 01:34:57.550]
She'll be 90.

[01:34:58.350 --> 01:34:59.170]
That's pretty old.

[01:34:59.470 --> 01:35:02.370]
You know, Barbara Cusgler carries the biggest range of Weber grills and accessories for

[01:35:02.370 --> 01:35:06.250]

625 squirms cooking area.

I guarantee you they got it waiting for you.

[01:36:12.390 --> 01:36:15.250]
Barbara Cusgler America's best Barbara Cusgler with stores and plantation.

[01:36:15.830 --> 01:36:19.450]
On university driving, a prestigious fountain shopping center called 9.5.4.

[01:36:20.410 --> 01:36:21.290]
423.1400.

[01:36:22.150 --> 01:36:23.030]
423.1400.

[01:36:23.370 --> 01:36:26.750]
And Carl Springs on a corner sample in Rock Island roads, column there at 9.5.4.

[01:36:27.090 --> 01:36:29.070]
7.5.766.68.

[01:36:30.950 --> 01:36:34.130]
If you've still been dragging your feet about getting all your Barbara Cusgler supplies,

[01:36:34.350 --> 01:36:38.230]
4th of July has come up this weekend so we'll make an immediate pit stop at Barbara Cusgler.

[01:36:46.390 --> 01:36:48.290]
I'm banging the butt, honey.

[01:36:48.370 --> 01:36:48.630]
Okay.

[01:36:49.150 --> 01:36:50.030]
Barry Manelow.

[01:36:50.390 --> 01:36:55.150]
He's had a ton of hits, but none as painful as the one he took when he walked into a wall

[01:36:55.150 --> 01:36:56.230]
and broke his nose.

[01:36:56.730 --> 01:36:57.190]
Ow!

[01:36:57.190 --> 01:37:03.090]
And now Barry's singing about it in his brand new CD can't smell without you, with

[01:37:03.090 --> 01:37:06.090]
fractured versions of Barry's hits like Ko-Faqa-Vanna.

[01:37:13.390 --> 01:37:18.550]
As well as a remastered and really nasally version of Mandy recorded at the moment of impact.

[01:37:24.630 --> 01:37:25.510]
But that's not all.

[01:37:25.510 --> 01:37:29.490]
Barry Manelow's can't smell without you is swollen with hits.

[01:37:29.610 --> 01:37:33.390]
You nose and love like I break the schnauz.

[01:37:33.630 --> 01:37:34.990]
I made it through the pain.

[01:37:35.470 --> 01:37:39.630]
Looks like I broke it and a title track with Barry's trademark hook.

[01:37:40.030 --> 01:37:44.470]
You know I can't smell without you.

[01:37:44.850 --> 01:37:48.730]
I can't breathe without you.

[01:37:49.270 --> 01:37:52.930]
I can't stiff and I can't thick.

[01:37:53.450 --> 01:37:55.090]
It looks like my face.

[01:37:55.090 --> 01:37:55.990]
Fucking head and that works.

[01:37:56.130 --> 01:37:56.710]
They're salivating.

[01:37:57.050 --> 01:37:58.350]
Operation Iranian Freedom.

[01:37:58.630 --> 01:37:59.090]
Let's hear it.

[01:37:59.090 --> 01:37:59.910]
I can see it now.

[01:37:59.950 --> 01:38:00.330]
Can't you?

[01:38:01.410 --> 01:38:01.770]
Oh yeah.

[01:38:01.870 --> 01:38:04.470]
So I get it pictures of the eye of Tolla, the big schmata head there.

[01:38:05.850 --> 01:38:07.110]
Everything crumbling around them.

[01:38:08.470 --> 01:38:11.390]
Are you checking the number of votes we have on this website today, Bonerboy?

[01:38:12.770 --> 01:38:13.450]
Kick it ass.

[01:38:14.750 --> 01:38:15.110]
509.

[01:38:15.310 --> 01:38:18.510]
No callers has been up there for a while and no votes for you.

[01:38:18.970 --> 01:38:23.510]
So while I understand the plea from that last caller who was very, very accurate in his

[01:38:23.510 --> 01:38:23.830]
comments.

[01:38:23.830 --> 01:38:27.670]
The audience, we have a large segment of our audience, they like bubble heads, okay?

[01:38:28.250 --> 01:38:29.950]
That's why we try to give everybody a little something.

[01:38:30.070 --> 01:38:32.290]
The callers on the show are an embarrassment to the human race.

[01:38:32.710 --> 01:38:34.910]
But you know, it's the way it goes.

[01:38:36.090 --> 01:38:38.010]
I pay attention to the same, but then we take calls or not.

[01:38:38.090 --> 01:38:41.670]
Whether I sit here reading those very articulate bed times stories for four hours or not.

[01:38:41.910 --> 01:38:43.550]
And then I'll get as a bunch of cramp forward anyway.

[01:38:45.810 --> 01:38:46.450]
Periodicals on an eye.

[01:38:46.570 --> 01:38:47.630]
And you know what else we didn't have?

[01:38:48.510 --> 01:38:48.830]
Chica.

[01:38:49.970 --> 01:38:50.510]
Very good.

[01:38:50.510 --> 01:38:53.430]
We never had any spy report on jikas performance Friday night.

[01:38:54.370 --> 01:38:57.250]
When he filled in for a decay again, you think how many people do you think we're listening

[01:38:57.250 --> 01:38:57.830]
after that game?

[01:38:57.930 --> 01:38:58.810]
Five thirty man.

[01:38:59.170 --> 01:39:02.710]
That by the way was the twenty five to seven game or whatever the final score was of that

[01:39:02.710 --> 01:39:04.790]
one, Boston twenty five in a Marlon seven.

[01:39:05.010 --> 01:39:07.590]
And they would have lost all three other than for a big comeback in the second game.

[01:39:07.910 --> 01:39:10.790]
But they gave up forty five runs and three games against a real team.

[01:39:10.930 --> 01:39:12.130]
I just mentioned that in passing.

[01:39:14.450 --> 01:39:17.170]
For my good friend Scott Farrell, who is a Marlon intensive.

[01:39:17.430 --> 01:39:19.770]
I'm sure that after a few months.

[01:39:19.770 --> 01:39:21.430]
He'll cure himself of that.

[01:39:21.730 --> 01:39:21.910]
Right.

[01:39:22.610 --> 01:39:23.250]
It'll happen.

[01:39:24.330 --> 01:39:25.690]
Five hundred nine votes.

[01:39:25.930 --> 01:39:27.270]
The last thing I want to hear.

[01:39:27.390 --> 01:39:29.150]
Oh, look at the way George is moving up there, beater.

[01:39:29.770 --> 01:39:31.190]
He is moving up that list.

[01:39:31.350 --> 01:39:32.110]
I'm proud of you.

[01:39:32.710 --> 01:39:33.650]
You're zooming up there.

[01:39:33.830 --> 01:39:34.230]
Just wait.

[01:39:34.970 --> 01:39:39.430]
The last thing I want to see we should rephrase it.

[01:39:39.550 --> 01:39:41.010]
The last thing I want to hear or hear about.

[01:39:41.110 --> 01:39:41.630]
I'm near Roger.

[01:39:41.630 --> 01:39:42.190]
Show is.

[01:39:42.510 --> 01:39:42.910]
What's the thing?

[01:39:43.670 --> 01:39:44.050]
Whatever.

[01:39:44.470 --> 01:39:46.350]
Let's rephrase the question just a little bit there.

[01:39:46.370 --> 01:39:47.070]
Eric, if you have time.

[01:39:47.070 --> 01:39:50.250]
Thanks again to our close personal friend Eric for bailing us out over the weekend because

[01:39:50.250 --> 01:39:51.150]
we had some issues.

[01:39:51.450 --> 01:39:52.270]
Thank you, Eric.

[01:39:56.010 --> 01:39:57.150]
Oh, my God.

[01:39:57.610 --> 01:39:59.150]
That just didn't sound real sincere.

[01:39:59.170 --> 01:40:00.270]
I want you to say that again.

[01:40:00.330 --> 01:40:01.530]
We're a little bit more enthusiasm.

[01:40:02.550 --> 01:40:03.990]
Eric, thank you very much.

[01:40:04.190 --> 01:40:06.230]
Thank you very much for bailing his ass out over the weekend.

[01:40:06.590 --> 01:40:09.970]
Since being your boy had some final issues there before straightening his life out and

[01:40:09.970 --> 01:40:10.850]
getting him back on track.

[01:40:11.130 --> 01:40:11.430]
Oh, yeah.

[01:40:11.490 --> 01:40:12.790]
Back on the tracks.

[01:40:13.410 --> 01:40:13.770]
Schmuck.

[01:40:14.590 --> 01:40:18.290]
The last thing I want to hear about here or hear about on the near Roger show is sports

[01:40:18.290 --> 01:40:18.850]
120.

[01:40:19.270 --> 01:40:20.950]
If following that clearance, they're sports down.

[01:40:21.070 --> 01:40:23.450]
They've had it when your goddamn sports up to their ears.

[01:40:23.790 --> 01:40:24.970]
Oh, they've had it.

[01:40:25.410 --> 01:40:26.470]
They can't stand it.

[01:40:27.190 --> 01:40:28.690]
What do you think is going to be the ACC?

[01:40:29.110 --> 01:40:30.130]
They're going to stand in big east.

[01:40:30.370 --> 01:40:31.210]
What about those headphones?

[01:40:31.410 --> 01:40:32.390]
What about Virginia Tech?

[01:40:32.690 --> 01:40:34.750]
Who gives a flying fig, OK?

[01:40:35.450 --> 01:40:36.310]
Give me one.

[01:40:37.450 --> 01:40:38.130]
No, they don't.

[01:40:38.130 --> 01:40:38.850]
They're going to think fig.

[01:40:39.010 --> 01:40:39.550]
That's what you were thinking.

[01:40:39.630 --> 01:40:40.610]
What's your name on passion?

[01:40:40.610 --> 01:40:41.530]
See us as that.

[01:40:41.690 --> 01:40:42.010]
Kate.

[01:40:42.570 --> 01:40:42.970]
Kate.

[01:40:43.170 --> 01:40:43.430]
Whatever.

[01:40:43.430 --> 01:40:44.150]
She OK.

[01:40:44.310 --> 01:40:45.130]
Kate Pasek.

[01:40:45.350 --> 01:40:46.610]
I've ever seen a flying fig.

[01:40:47.270 --> 01:40:49.310]
Yes, as a matter of fact, I think there was one in most.

[01:40:49.470 --> 01:40:50.950]
That's what he was reaching there to grab.

[01:40:51.070 --> 01:40:51.870]
They keep flying in there.

[01:40:51.930 --> 01:40:52.730]
They keep zooming in there.

[01:40:53.510 --> 01:40:55.430]
He keeps trying to yank him out.

[01:40:56.910 --> 01:40:59.810]
The last thing I want to hear about on the near Roger show is sports 120.

[01:40:59.990 --> 01:41:01.670]
We will never talk about sports on this show.

[01:41:02.110 --> 01:41:07.250]
Eating ass is moved in the second place and may just pass sports momentarily, which I

[01:41:07.250 --> 01:41:08.730]
guess that is kind of a sport, wouldn't you say?

[01:41:09.270 --> 01:41:10.750]
It depends on how you look at it.

[01:41:11.030 --> 01:41:11.230]
Yeah.

[01:41:11.230 --> 01:41:12.490]
It depends on how you look at it.

[01:41:12.570 --> 01:41:13.270]
Some people it's a career.

[01:41:13.690 --> 01:41:14.610]
Depends on how you look at it.

[01:41:14.730 --> 01:41:15.370]
Eating ass 100.

[01:41:15.870 --> 01:41:16.450]
Hockey 89.

[01:41:16.710 --> 01:41:20.050]
Now that is a sport and my favorite and even for all admits it's his favorite, but he

[01:41:20.050 --> 01:41:22.990]
doesn't talk about it too much because he's already learned that you people don't care.

[01:41:23.210 --> 01:41:24.250]
Plus it's the middle of the summer.

[01:41:25.730 --> 01:41:27.910]
And of course, there's not going to be any season after this one.

[01:41:27.950 --> 01:41:28.970]
So what's the point?

[01:41:29.050 --> 01:41:31.910]
And they're not resigning any players with big bucks because they know there's not going

[01:41:31.910 --> 01:41:32.950]
to be a season next year.

[01:41:34.110 --> 01:41:36.190]
Moe Howard David at 57, 10.9%.

[01:41:37.150 --> 01:41:37.470]
Absolutely.

[01:41:37.830 --> 01:41:38.990]
Maybe we got to stop picking on Moe.

[01:41:38.990 --> 01:41:39.310]
What do you think?

[01:41:39.450 --> 01:41:39.590]
No.

[01:41:39.970 --> 01:41:43.750]
Or maybe at least put his, we're not going to put your home address on a website mode.

[01:41:43.870 --> 01:41:44.230]
Just relax.

[01:41:44.390 --> 01:41:45.730]
We would never do anything that grotesque.

[01:41:45.790 --> 01:41:50.210]
We might run it on some tea room walls though in the appropriate places.

[01:41:50.550 --> 01:41:54.170]
In fact, well, music 33.

[01:41:54.870 --> 01:41:56.530]
Now that's not too bad, you know what?

[01:41:57.390 --> 01:41:59.130]
Because I thought that they hated my music.

[01:41:59.250 --> 01:42:01.270]
I thought this audience generally speaking because I'm an old fart.

[01:42:01.370 --> 01:42:02.090]
I admitted O 35.

[01:42:02.090 --> 01:42:03.450]
I just went up as I said it.

[01:42:04.070 --> 01:42:07.370]
I'm an old fart and I would like the music of the 50, 60s and 70s.

[01:42:07.370 --> 01:42:09.670]
In the last of the 20, 30 years, there hadn't been too much.

[01:42:09.850 --> 01:42:11.870]
It's crap, especially rap is garbage.

[01:42:12.510 --> 01:42:13.030]
It is.

[01:42:13.130 --> 01:42:13.890]
Oh, that's Kate Hepburn.

[01:42:14.090 --> 01:42:18.810]
She had various health problems in later years, including hip replacement surgery and

[01:42:18.810 --> 01:42:19.410]
tremors.

[01:42:20.090 --> 01:42:21.130]
She had tremors?

[01:42:21.810 --> 01:42:22.850]
I never noticed that.

[01:42:23.530 --> 01:42:23.910]
Didn't you?

[01:42:24.670 --> 01:42:24.830]
Yeah.

[01:42:26.010 --> 01:42:26.810]
Music 35.

[01:42:26.990 --> 01:42:28.810]
Pollocks 631, only 5.8%.

[01:42:28.810 --> 01:42:31.530]
They want us to keep bashing bush and we're going to continue doing that.

[01:42:31.670 --> 01:42:34.710]
No matter what the numbers on here show, we will continue being one of the few shows

[01:42:34.710 --> 01:42:38.210]
in the history of mankind to tell like it is about these Nazis who stole your government.

[01:42:39.030 --> 01:42:39.710]
Movies 30.

[01:42:40.630 --> 01:42:41.210]
How many?

[01:42:41.390 --> 01:42:42.290]
Five third man.

[01:42:42.590 --> 01:42:43.470]
George 27.

[01:42:43.470 --> 01:42:46.250]
You have moved from nowhere to 27.

[01:42:46.250 --> 01:42:50.550]
In fact, you're only eight votes away from fifth place at the moment and zooming up the

[01:42:50.550 --> 01:42:50.770]
list.

[01:42:51.170 --> 01:42:51.870]
Religion 18.

[01:42:52.170 --> 01:42:54.070]
Now that came from 0 to 18 awfully fast.

[01:42:54.250 --> 01:42:56.750]
That must be some of them right wing Bible thumping assholes.

[01:42:57.090 --> 01:42:58.370]
Maybe Dennis voted a few times.

[01:42:59.530 --> 01:42:59.890]
Oh, that's right.

[01:42:59.890 --> 01:43:00.110]
I forgot.

[01:43:00.190 --> 01:43:02.430]
He doesn't want to hear about religion because that would include all those child molesting

[01:43:02.430 --> 01:43:04.670]
priests, all those priest stories that you made up.

[01:43:04.670 --> 01:43:09.570]
QA Mog that I just keep going and winning QA M office politics 15 that second to last

[01:43:09.570 --> 01:43:11.370]
and now we got three for the callers.

[01:43:11.390 --> 01:43:12.610]
Oh, I don't want to hear callers.

[01:43:12.630 --> 01:43:13.470]
They can't stand it.

[01:43:13.750 --> 01:43:15.010]
Our callers are great.

[01:43:15.150 --> 01:43:18.250]
Here's one on line nine, which is always guaranteed WQA M.

[01:43:18.550 --> 01:43:19.790]
He'd wait to respond on call.

[01:43:19.810 --> 01:43:20.310]
There he is.

[01:43:20.510 --> 01:43:20.810]
Yeah.

[01:43:21.750 --> 01:43:22.450]
You know something?

[01:43:22.650 --> 01:43:24.870]
I just realized that's the same guy.

[01:43:25.550 --> 01:43:25.950]
Yeah.

[01:43:26.170 --> 01:43:29.790]
No, no, no, you know, I'm talking about that's the same guy as the chronic spartz you've

[01:43:29.790 --> 01:43:29.870]
got.

[01:43:29.930 --> 01:43:30.750]
That's the same guy.

[01:43:31.030 --> 01:43:31.030]

[01:43:31.030 --> 01:43:32.330]
That is the chronic spartz you've got right.

[01:43:33.130 --> 01:43:35.450]
But I didn't realize he was also the whispering guy.

[01:43:36.450 --> 01:43:36.990]
That's him.

[01:43:39.970 --> 01:43:43.810]
So you see, you've been it's always nice to know that because that, you know, it's.

[01:43:45.610 --> 01:43:47.950]
Now you know, damn well, this has got to be.

[01:43:47.990 --> 01:43:49.050]
Isn't this the same person here?

[01:43:49.070 --> 01:43:53.010]
The one you just fact me that keeps changing names from Chris to Tony.

[01:43:53.430 --> 01:43:55.890]
It's just love your show recently moved from day to day to keep cruel.

[01:43:55.890 --> 01:43:57.970]
Otherwise, known as the home of the newly wedded nearly dead.

[01:43:58.930 --> 01:43:59.990]
Now, this is somebody different.

[01:43:59.990 --> 01:44:02.630]
I listen to you, Scott Mad Dog in the hammer by the internet.

[01:44:03.250 --> 01:44:05.650]
Uh, the receptionist flawless and keep oral.

[01:44:06.050 --> 01:44:07.530]
It's better than the radio when I lived in Miami.

[01:44:07.670 --> 01:44:10.970]
I'm sure that because you don't have all those high tension wires and all that crap.

[01:44:11.970 --> 01:44:14.350]
Yeah, if you're in Miami, you got to hear QM like through a strainer.

[01:44:14.770 --> 01:44:16.070]
You have to strain to hear it.

[01:44:16.430 --> 01:44:17.890]
My thoughts on how we're David at it.

[01:44:17.950 --> 01:44:19.390]
Yuck, it says why you K.

[01:44:19.530 --> 01:44:19.830]
Yuck.

[01:44:20.690 --> 01:44:22.850]
I'd rather watch May and A sitting in the sun mold.

[01:44:23.130 --> 01:44:24.690]
And I see this should be a comment.

[01:44:25.010 --> 01:44:29.410]
I'd rather watch May and A sitting in the sun molding than eat it and eat it than listen

[01:44:29.410 --> 01:44:31.270]
to him and his boy to a good guilty locks.

[01:44:31.970 --> 01:44:33.470]
The man is a tumor with a voice.

[01:44:33.670 --> 01:44:34.330]
So that's interesting.

[01:44:34.530 --> 01:44:35.170]
Tumor with a voice.

[01:44:35.790 --> 01:44:37.350]
Maybe he's a back home with the voice.

[01:44:38.070 --> 01:44:40.850]
Keep bragging on a meals great fun regards M in Cape Coral.

[01:44:40.950 --> 01:44:41.530]
Thank you very much.

[01:44:41.570 --> 01:44:42.250]
M in Cape Coral.

[01:44:42.330 --> 01:44:44.090]
Have a wonderful day and a great holiday.

[01:44:45.330 --> 01:44:46.510]
The votes are pouring in on the polls.

[01:44:46.650 --> 01:44:47.750]
Everything is just hunky dory.

[01:44:47.870 --> 01:44:50.690]
See now if you're one of those people very emotional and high strung, you'd say,

[01:44:50.730 --> 01:44:51.750]
Oh, gee, the phone.

[01:44:51.930 --> 01:44:53.330]
I mean, there are a lot of people calling right now.

[01:44:53.430 --> 01:44:55.210]
Screamless, but I'm not taking them till I'm good and ready.

[01:44:57.390 --> 01:44:58.630]
Just remember what I told you.

[01:44:58.710 --> 01:45:01.170]
The phone means absolutely nothing.

[01:45:01.630 --> 01:45:02.950]
Yeah, but what about that?

[01:45:05.430 --> 01:45:07.770]
Absolutely, positively WQ I am.

[01:45:08.730 --> 01:45:09.510]
An example line.

[01:45:09.670 --> 01:45:09.990]
Yes, sir.

[01:45:10.510 --> 01:45:10.930]
Yeah, me.

[01:45:10.950 --> 01:45:12.470]
I called you a couple of years ago.

[01:45:12.670 --> 01:45:13.950]
Whatever happened to Steve's pizza.

[01:45:14.890 --> 01:45:15.770]
What do you mean by that?

[01:45:17.010 --> 01:45:20.010]
Remember, we had a conversation about that.

[01:45:20.390 --> 01:45:20.950]
What does that mean?

[01:45:21.030 --> 01:45:22.330]
Whatever happened to Steve's pizza?

[01:45:22.330 --> 01:45:23.010]
Are they out of business?

[01:45:23.390 --> 01:45:23.770]
I don't know.

[01:45:23.770 --> 01:45:24.990]
Whatever happened to him.

[01:45:25.950 --> 01:45:27.750]
We'll dig into that for his sonny.

[01:45:27.830 --> 01:45:29.130]
OK, we'll check it out.

[01:45:29.650 --> 01:45:31.130]
That's about that wasn't a good example.

[01:45:32.130 --> 01:45:34.390]
No, that was actually one of our better calls today.

[01:45:35.210 --> 01:45:35.770]
Top 10.

[01:45:36.110 --> 01:45:36.590]
Top 10.

[01:45:36.790 --> 01:45:37.190]
Absolutely.

[01:45:37.410 --> 01:45:38.290]
Sure, he was pretty good.

[01:45:39.750 --> 01:45:40.570]
What's wrong with you?

[01:45:40.730 --> 01:45:41.510]
What was wrong with that guy?

[01:45:41.630 --> 01:45:43.310]
He wants to know what happened to Steve's pizza.

[01:45:43.310 --> 01:45:44.070]
It was a good place.

[01:45:44.170 --> 01:45:46.810]
It was on Biscayne nearby, about 125th or whatever.

[01:45:47.330 --> 01:45:47.730]
Remember it?

[01:45:47.950 --> 01:45:48.090]
No.

[01:45:48.890 --> 01:45:51.970]
It was next to the old pumper mix.

[01:45:51.970 --> 01:45:54.010]
There was on the corner there, across from that scam

[01:45:54.010 --> 01:45:56.350]
a diet place I had there for a few months, a landlord.

[01:45:56.950 --> 01:45:59.150]
Thanks again, Paul Light, by the way, for sent me up

[01:45:59.150 --> 01:45:59.910]
and at Vogue's business.

[01:46:00.030 --> 01:46:01.530]
That was very embarrassing many, many years ago.

[01:46:01.810 --> 01:46:04.030]
It was a long time ago, almost a-

[01:46:04.350 --> 01:46:04.890]
3rd man.

[01:46:05.030 --> 01:46:05.450]
Years ago.

[01:46:07.650 --> 01:46:09.710]
I mean, when you go into a diet place

[01:46:09.710 --> 01:46:12.250]
and you see a big fat guy, well, I don't want to get into that.

[01:46:12.730 --> 01:46:14.350]
Isn't that a shame that we don't have PD Lenny

[01:46:14.350 --> 01:46:15.090]
to kick around anymore?

[01:46:15.270 --> 01:46:17.270]
He just makes my skin crawl that guy.

[01:46:17.370 --> 01:46:17.810]
What do you mean?

[01:46:17.950 --> 01:46:18.750]
Oh, and you know something?

[01:46:19.490 --> 01:46:19.650]
What?

[01:46:20.070 --> 01:46:20.870]
I better not say it.

[01:46:20.870 --> 01:46:21.750]
I'll tell you off the ear.

[01:46:22.110 --> 01:46:22.190]
OK.

[01:46:22.430 --> 01:46:23.510]
No, about that spot that he does?

[01:46:24.410 --> 01:46:24.730]
Yeah.

[01:46:24.790 --> 01:46:26.470]
Remind me to tell you one of these, like tomorrow morning.

[01:46:26.790 --> 01:46:26.970]
All right.

[01:46:27.810 --> 01:46:29.790]
1213 at 560 WQM.

[01:46:29.790 --> 01:46:31.230]
Hey, if you're in a really dead end job,

[01:46:31.230 --> 01:46:34.350]

That is absolutely correct.

Only 10 bucks a month and three nights a week for just four

[01:46:49.250 --> 01:46:50.530]

We're sports radio five 60s.

You ain't you, A.M.

[01:47:52.130 --> 01:47:52.710]
Gay.

[01:48:01.950 --> 01:48:04.150]
We are coming, the F.A.G.

[01:48:04.510 --> 01:48:05.230]
We are F.A.G.

[01:48:07.250 --> 01:48:09.630]
Yeah, we are F.A.G.

[01:48:10.390 --> 01:48:13.190]
We are coming, the F.A.G.

[01:48:13.870 --> 01:48:15.230]
What did I play shit?

[01:48:15.290 --> 01:48:17.490]
Oh, I'll play with you, remember.

[01:48:18.010 --> 01:48:20.270]
Oh, gay guys got your back.

[01:48:20.370 --> 01:48:20.930]
Remember that?

[01:48:21.130 --> 01:48:22.510]
Because that's where we're looking for lovers,

[01:48:22.750 --> 01:48:23.410]
where you're cracksack.

[01:48:23.650 --> 01:48:25.490]
To finish held by me, F.A.G.

[01:48:25.670 --> 01:48:27.670]
I got less facial hair than a levy,

[01:48:27.910 --> 01:48:28.650]
so it'll make fun.

[01:48:28.810 --> 01:48:30.290]
Don't poke your nose at the queer,

[01:48:30.470 --> 01:48:31.870]
cake boy, lifestyle, I joke.

[01:48:32.310 --> 01:48:34.310]
Stop your gay jokes and start being violent

[01:48:34.310 --> 01:48:36.510]
because you might get a taste of homosexual violence.

[01:48:36.790 --> 01:48:38.670]
We don't play your book, my target,

[01:48:38.670 --> 01:48:39.970]
like a dog in a territory.

[01:48:39.970 --> 01:48:41.010]
You know, I ain't market,

[01:48:41.230 --> 01:48:42.890]
but when you see us with our Ray Bans,

[01:48:43.050 --> 01:48:45.890]
we're just buying the parts that we want to get our hands on.

[01:48:46.610 --> 01:48:48.870]
We are F.A.G.

[01:48:48.890 --> 01:48:49.690]
We're the F.A.G.

[01:48:50.010 --> 01:48:50.390]
Sensor.

[01:48:51.070 --> 01:48:51.270]
Ooh.

[01:48:53.070 --> 01:48:54.970]
And don't you forget it.

[01:48:55.610 --> 01:48:57.670]
We are F.A.G.

[01:48:57.990 --> 01:48:59.750]
Really all that hardest wall.

[01:49:00.110 --> 01:49:02.010]
We're just singing, baby.

[01:49:02.710 --> 01:49:04.250]
Let me see you just prance with me.

[01:49:04.470 --> 01:49:05.410]
Just prance with me.

[01:49:05.570 --> 01:49:06.050]
Now slide.

[01:49:06.870 --> 01:49:07.570]
Ooh, right there.

[01:49:07.570 --> 01:49:09.650]
Let me see you do some waistband.

[01:49:10.170 --> 01:49:11.250]
Oh, perfect.

[01:49:11.670 --> 01:49:12.470]
And then Chris Limp.

[01:49:15.950 --> 01:49:16.770]
That's it, baby.

[01:49:16.990 --> 01:49:18.010]
Just prance.

[01:49:19.050 --> 01:49:19.350]
Whoa.

[01:49:20.190 --> 01:49:21.130]
Now look what you went and did.

[01:49:21.730 --> 01:49:22.650]
Oh, I got a white dissolve.

[01:49:24.350 --> 01:49:25.870]
Oh, we change to this everywhere.

[01:49:27.110 --> 01:49:28.870]
Showtons, take a fairy.

[01:49:29.190 --> 01:49:30.610]
Just think nobody has a white talent.

[01:49:33.490 --> 01:49:34.450]
Okay, love us.

[01:49:34.630 --> 01:49:35.550]
Cut this crap out.

[01:49:36.930 --> 01:49:37.430]
You're no.

[01:49:37.690 --> 01:49:38.410]
You're any caroling.

[01:49:38.890 --> 01:49:39.370]
That's right.

[01:49:39.530 --> 01:49:39.730]
We're here.

[01:49:39.870 --> 01:49:41.290]
We're checking out your rear.

[01:49:41.470 --> 01:49:42.550]
So beware, Bill Fist.

[01:49:42.650 --> 01:49:42.890]
A first.

[01:49:43.870 --> 01:49:45.930]
1218 at 560 WQYM.

[01:49:45.950 --> 01:49:47.410]
Yeah, they're going to have to find a new scapegoat.

[01:49:47.450 --> 01:49:49.610]
This is going to require a lot of changing the stationery

[01:49:49.610 --> 01:49:51.730]
and rewriting letterhead and all kinds of stuff, you know?

[01:49:52.550 --> 01:49:52.890]
Too bad.

[01:49:54.690 --> 01:49:55.910]
563 votes on his pool.

[01:49:56.070 --> 01:49:58.330]
And George is moving miraculously up the list.

[01:49:58.410 --> 01:49:59.550]
He's past movies.

[01:49:59.910 --> 01:50:01.030]
He's past politics.

[01:50:01.230 --> 01:50:02.210]
He's past music.

[01:50:02.410 --> 01:50:04.670]
And now he's in the fifth place with 36 votes.

[01:50:04.670 --> 01:50:06.330]
You've got a long way to go to catch Moe.

[01:50:06.330 --> 01:50:07.070]
No problem.

[01:50:07.390 --> 01:50:10.350]
Confidence is high that George can catch Moe.

[01:50:10.390 --> 01:50:12.990]
The last thing I want to hear or hear about on the near Roger show

[01:50:12.990 --> 01:50:13.950]
could be movie talking.

[01:50:14.190 --> 01:50:15.270]
Oh, right.

[01:50:15.470 --> 01:50:16.090]
They like that today.

[01:50:16.090 --> 01:50:17.070]
They're in a different mood today.

[01:50:18.430 --> 01:50:23.170]
On the back, it says the review David Meyer in New York Times,

[01:50:23.170 --> 01:50:24.230]
which this is 84.

[01:50:24.430 --> 01:50:25.450]
This is 19 years ago.

[01:50:26.670 --> 01:50:29.410]
Maybe the definitive gangster picture, really equal.

[01:50:29.650 --> 01:50:31.730]
See, I don't look upon this as a gangster picture.

[01:50:32.210 --> 01:50:32.650]
Right.

[01:50:33.970 --> 01:50:34.690]
Godfather, goodfellas.

[01:50:35.910 --> 01:50:36.010]
Huh?

[01:50:36.570 --> 01:50:36.690]
Right.

[01:50:37.330 --> 01:50:38.330]
A lot of those were in Nebraska.

[01:50:39.090 --> 01:50:39.210]
Right.

[01:50:39.450 --> 01:50:40.330]
Those were gangster pictures.

[01:50:40.810 --> 01:50:42.930]
This to me is more like autobiographical.

[01:50:43.030 --> 01:50:44.370]
This is the story of these people.

[01:50:44.430 --> 01:50:45.930]
Now the fact that they happen to be gangsters,

[01:50:46.030 --> 01:50:46.890]
that's how they made their living.

[01:50:47.090 --> 01:50:47.230]
Right.

[01:50:47.390 --> 01:50:50.130]
That, of course, is the, you know, that's the core of the movie.

[01:50:50.450 --> 01:50:52.430]
But to me, that's not how I look upon this movie.

[01:50:52.610 --> 01:50:55.130]
I just, I never thought that this is a gangster movie per se.

[01:50:55.470 --> 01:50:55.830]
Right.

[01:50:56.330 --> 01:51:00.470]
It's a story about a bunch of friends who bonded together with kids

[01:51:00.470 --> 01:51:03.630]
and then went through life, you know, and kind of wanted a part

[01:51:03.630 --> 01:51:04.410]
for whatever reasons.

[01:51:04.770 --> 01:51:06.470]
And then like eventually came to an end.

[01:51:07.110 --> 01:51:08.190]
Not necessarily a good one.

[01:51:08.450 --> 01:51:09.610]
Now that's the way I look at it.

[01:51:10.630 --> 01:51:11.430]
Anybody disagree?

[01:51:11.830 --> 01:51:11.930]
Nope.

[01:51:12.210 --> 01:51:12.790]
Too bad.

[01:51:14.050 --> 01:51:15.590]
Did B.N. Boycey this movie?

[01:51:16.690 --> 01:51:17.690]
Once upon a time in America?

[01:51:18.030 --> 01:51:18.250]
Yes.

[01:51:18.490 --> 01:51:18.630]
Yeah.

[01:51:19.030 --> 01:51:20.190]
Well, what do you say it like that for?

[01:51:20.750 --> 01:51:22.590]
No, because I have more like of an, of course.

[01:51:23.350 --> 01:51:25.910]
But you also saw kids in that other bully.

[01:51:27.770 --> 01:51:28.170]
What?

[01:51:28.870 --> 01:51:29.430]
Wully, bully.

[01:51:30.250 --> 01:51:32.170]
Don't see bully, by the way, all your people out there.

[01:51:32.270 --> 01:51:33.370]
I know what happened in Weston.

[01:51:33.490 --> 01:51:34.970]
I know it wasn't Weston back then.

[01:51:34.990 --> 01:51:36.390]
It was called West Hollywood or whatever.

[01:51:36.690 --> 01:51:37.190]
It sucks.

[01:51:37.570 --> 01:51:38.370]
It's a bad movie.

[01:51:38.810 --> 01:51:39.410]
Bad acting.

[01:51:39.810 --> 01:51:41.170]
It's gratuitous, stupid violence.

[01:51:41.410 --> 01:51:41.890]
And don't see it.

[01:51:41.910 --> 01:51:42.990]
It's a piece of crap.

[01:51:43.710 --> 01:51:44.430]
Don't see bully.

[01:51:46.450 --> 01:51:47.390]
Come into Q.A.M.

[01:51:48.450 --> 01:51:48.810]
Yeah.

[01:51:49.030 --> 01:51:49.190]
Hi.

[01:51:49.330 --> 01:51:50.910]
I just really wanted to change my vote.

[01:51:50.990 --> 01:51:52.790]
I was a fool and I voted for sports.

[01:51:52.990 --> 01:51:54.850]
And I definitely want to vote for callers now.

[01:51:55.330 --> 01:51:56.510]
I don't know what the options are.

[01:51:56.690 --> 01:51:57.610]
And I hate change.

[01:51:58.190 --> 01:52:00.770]
It's a killer and I just can't stand it.

[01:52:00.830 --> 01:52:01.690]
It's about to drive me nuts.

[01:52:01.770 --> 01:52:02.650]
I'm sure you guys too.

[01:52:03.330 --> 01:52:05.130]
But last thought, love George.

[01:52:05.250 --> 01:52:05.910]
I think he's great.

[01:52:06.190 --> 01:52:08.130]
I'm excited to see him this, or hear him this summer.

[01:52:08.470 --> 01:52:08.610]
Wow.

[01:52:08.790 --> 01:52:09.910]
And thanks a lot.

[01:52:10.410 --> 01:52:11.370]
God bless you, man.

[01:52:11.970 --> 01:52:12.390]
Thanks a lot.

[01:52:12.390 --> 01:52:12.550]
Best part.

[01:52:12.710 --> 01:52:13.650]
We've ever had on this show.

[01:52:13.750 --> 01:52:14.350]
Thank you so much.

[01:52:14.590 --> 01:52:15.470]
That was the best suck job.

[01:52:15.670 --> 01:52:15.830]
Wow.

[01:52:15.970 --> 01:52:16.430]
Squirt Squirt.

[01:52:16.990 --> 01:52:17.610]
That's howl.

[01:52:17.910 --> 01:52:18.650]
That was great.

[01:52:19.030 --> 01:52:21.490]
He did both of us at the same time in just a few seconds.

[01:52:22.110 --> 01:52:22.470]
Thank you.

[01:52:23.450 --> 01:52:24.430]
Thank you so much.

[01:52:24.530 --> 01:52:25.270]
No, that was good.

[01:52:25.850 --> 01:52:26.330]
That was good.

[01:52:26.330 --> 01:52:32.290]
But because most of the people they just want to use this is an opportunity as a as a as a release for their

[01:52:32.290 --> 01:52:37.470]
Ventum is that illiterate asshole would say that's for sale their Ventum V E and T. I.M.

[01:52:37.790 --> 01:52:38.330]
The smock.

[01:52:39.390 --> 01:52:40.610]
But this guy is right.

[01:52:40.770 --> 01:52:41.810]
The caller is generally speaking.

[01:52:41.970 --> 01:52:44.510]
Oh, you got to bring in C span to cover your callers.

[01:52:44.590 --> 01:52:46.630]
You got to bring I mean, I'm nice.

[01:52:46.710 --> 01:52:47.630]
I'm kind of a moron.

[01:52:47.630 --> 01:52:50.370]
I may be stupid, but I'm not that stupid that on national TV.

[01:52:50.370 --> 01:52:54.770]
I'm going to embarrass myself bringing some high fluten hot shot from the national media.

[01:52:54.770 --> 01:52:55.750]
And so they can listen to.

[01:52:55.830 --> 01:52:56.510]
But it comes.

[01:52:56.830 --> 01:52:57.390]
But it comes.

[01:52:57.710 --> 01:53:01.330]
And then can you imagine if you actually announced that C span was in their taping.

[01:53:01.350 --> 01:53:01.870]
Oh, yeah.

[01:53:02.250 --> 01:53:03.790]
Then we really get some beauties.

[01:53:04.050 --> 01:53:05.690]
Then we have the guy with the eyes.

[01:53:05.870 --> 01:53:07.670]
We have that one that misfit.

[01:53:07.970 --> 01:53:08.770]
We'd have them all.

[01:53:09.230 --> 01:53:09.490]
Right.

[01:53:09.970 --> 01:53:12.610]
Just venting over to show their ass to the world on C span.

[01:53:12.610 --> 01:53:12.990]
Black dome.

[01:53:13.130 --> 01:53:13.490]
See an end.

[01:53:13.650 --> 01:53:14.590]
Where would a hell they could.

[01:53:14.750 --> 01:53:15.810]
Where would a hell they could hang it out.

[01:53:16.570 --> 01:53:17.430]
But that's okay.

[01:53:17.570 --> 01:53:19.150]
Because the Czechs were real nicely by the way.

[01:53:19.410 --> 01:53:20.190]
Thanks again, Clarence.

[01:53:20.210 --> 01:53:21.670]
It showed up on the 25th.

[01:53:21.670 --> 01:53:22.270]
Whatever it was.

[01:53:22.930 --> 01:53:23.790]
Clarence is the best.

[01:53:24.390 --> 01:53:28.450]
Now a little suggestion for being a boy since you've been going through these very traumatic times.

[01:53:29.030 --> 01:53:33.550]
It would be a real good idea to get to make like a note right on your wrist like in Memento.

[01:53:33.910 --> 01:53:34.670]
Right on your wrist.

[01:53:34.970 --> 01:53:37.110]
Get in that time sheet.

[01:53:38.570 --> 01:53:40.170]
Maybe even put the dates in there.

[01:53:40.270 --> 01:53:41.250]
They're like the dead like a wall.

[01:53:42.170 --> 01:53:43.070]
It's on the wall.

[01:53:43.710 --> 01:53:45.370]
It's been posted up right behind me.

[01:53:45.670 --> 01:53:51.190]
Well, well, put a thing on your wrist to check the wall for time sheet for time sheet reminder.

[01:53:51.630 --> 01:53:51.910]
Yeah.

[01:53:52.430 --> 01:53:53.530]
Take a look at the wall.

[01:53:54.170 --> 01:53:55.750]
And we're not talking about pink Floyd either.

[01:53:55.910 --> 01:53:56.010]
Okay.

[01:53:56.770 --> 01:53:57.230]
Pink Floyd.

[01:53:57.290 --> 01:53:57.930]
Who the hell is that?

[01:53:59.290 --> 01:54:03.770]
567.0560.560 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line.

[01:54:04.510 --> 01:54:06.870]
We got dancing dwarf Mo on our website today.

[01:54:06.950 --> 01:54:09.230]
It's a thing that will just keep you the best right.

[01:54:09.630 --> 01:54:11.390]
And listen, I wanted to do this thing right now.

[01:54:11.470 --> 01:54:13.590]
If you get like hypnotized, you're in transpired at.

[01:54:13.810 --> 01:54:16.190]
We will take no responsibility for it.

[01:54:16.570 --> 01:54:16.670]
Right.

[01:54:16.810 --> 01:54:17.670]
Don't look at it while you're driving.

[01:54:17.670 --> 01:54:18.330]
What was the show?

[01:54:18.410 --> 01:54:19.370]
Was it the prisoner?

[01:54:20.230 --> 01:54:21.650]
Were they had a thing like that?

[01:54:21.910 --> 01:54:22.790]
No, maybe it wasn't.

[01:54:22.890 --> 01:54:23.170]
I don't know.

[01:54:23.430 --> 01:54:24.250]
You know what I'm talking about.

[01:54:24.530 --> 01:54:24.650]
Right.

[01:54:24.790 --> 01:54:25.830]
The big swirly, the big pepper.

[01:54:25.850 --> 01:54:26.830]
Right. Was that on the prisoner?

[01:54:27.050 --> 01:54:27.470]
It might have been.

[01:54:27.890 --> 01:54:28.390]
I think so.

[01:54:30.670 --> 01:54:31.690]
Ask number six.

[01:54:32.190 --> 01:54:34.850]
Who's number two when you go take a number one and two?

[01:54:35.270 --> 01:54:36.370]
I always get my numbers confused.

[01:54:36.530 --> 01:54:40.450]
But when I get to number three, then I really start straining real bad.

[01:54:41.110 --> 01:54:43.650]
Not only can I remember what it is, but I'm not sure I can do it.

[01:54:44.530 --> 01:54:45.250]
1126.12.

[01:54:45.390 --> 01:54:46.350]
Oh, don't do that.

[01:54:46.350 --> 01:54:46.790]
I'm not sure.

[01:54:47.110 --> 01:54:47.690]
No, you see this.

[01:54:47.750 --> 01:54:48.810]
It's 1230 already.

[01:54:48.930 --> 01:54:52.890]
Mandate it to hand it for Barra ball game again at crab braves in the Marlins.

[01:54:53.410 --> 01:54:58.730]
It really is amazing to me that Moe is going to the ball game tonight because his Atlanta

[01:54:58.730 --> 01:55:01.730]
braves are going to that would be like my going to a Panther game because the Leafs were

[01:55:01.730 --> 01:55:02.310]
in town planned.

[01:55:02.930 --> 01:55:03.570]
See what I'm saying?

[01:55:04.490 --> 01:55:05.590]
Nice going, Moe.

[01:55:06.590 --> 01:55:06.990]
Right.

[01:55:07.310 --> 01:55:07.710]
Absolutely.

[01:55:07.970 --> 01:55:08.150]
Sure.

[01:55:08.470 --> 01:55:09.650]
I support him on that.

[01:55:09.910 --> 01:55:11.470]
He admits he likes the braves.

[01:55:11.850 --> 01:55:12.990]
He's a front running phony.

[01:55:13.270 --> 01:55:16.330]
And so he's going to area.

[01:55:16.330 --> 01:55:16.530]
He's going to be a team.

[01:55:17.750 --> 01:55:19.610]
And like I said, there would be his poor taste.

[01:55:19.610 --> 01:55:22.970]
It's my going to a Panther game and rooting for the my Toronto Maple Leafs to beat the

[01:55:22.970 --> 01:55:23.850]
crap out of the Panthers.

[01:55:24.350 --> 01:55:25.590]
Very, very poor style.

[01:55:26.630 --> 01:55:29.110]
26 past noon at 560 WQM.

[01:55:29.110 --> 01:55:29.870]
I don't have to tell you.

[01:55:29.950 --> 01:55:30.810]
It's the end of June.

[01:55:31.210 --> 01:55:33.930]
And don't forget is you're watching one of those that's got like the you've got to move

[01:55:33.930 --> 01:55:35.770]
it ahead for the 31st.

[01:55:36.490 --> 01:55:36.850]
Yeah.

[01:55:37.370 --> 01:55:38.310]
You know what I'm talking about?

[01:55:38.490 --> 01:55:39.430]
The time change thing.

[01:55:39.790 --> 01:55:40.110]
Yeah.

[01:55:40.410 --> 01:55:41.610]
Mine is, but Carlos is not.

[01:55:42.270 --> 01:55:43.350]
Carlos, what do you mean by that?

[01:55:43.470 --> 01:55:44.770]
It's satellite self-adjusting.

[01:55:45.550 --> 01:55:47.870]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

[01:55:47.870 --> 01:55:48.230]
Whoa.

[01:55:49.530 --> 01:55:53.670]
Carlos has a satellite self-adjusting watch that I bought for him so that he would never

[01:55:53.670 --> 01:55:55.410]
be late for anything, but that was months ago.

[01:55:56.030 --> 01:55:57.790]
It must be working really well.

[01:55:58.270 --> 01:55:59.270]
But you got to look at it first.

[01:55:59.690 --> 01:56:00.430]
Yeah, I see.

[01:56:00.630 --> 01:56:01.350]
I don't want to look at it.

[01:56:01.870 --> 01:56:06.490]
I hear it's kind of like angle like a J. Hurricane season is here.

[01:56:06.710 --> 01:56:08.670]
Before Storm hits you, put up shutters to prevent.

[01:56:08.830 --> 01:56:09.850]
See, there should be a commoner.

[01:56:09.950 --> 01:56:10.330]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:56:10.830 --> 01:56:11.690]
Who wrote this copy?

[01:56:11.790 --> 01:56:13.730]
It's an awful, awful glaring error.

[01:56:14.210 --> 01:56:18.370]
Before Storm hits comma, can I start this over again, please?

[01:56:18.470 --> 01:56:18.550]
No.

[01:56:18.650 --> 01:56:19.270]
I feel so bad.

[01:56:19.370 --> 01:56:22.610]
No, because these people are paying a lot of money and the people are right to copy

[01:56:22.610 --> 01:56:23.110]
an ed building.

[01:56:23.130 --> 01:56:24.690]
I don't want to mention like Adam or anybody.

[01:56:24.830 --> 01:56:25.950]
They don't even look at this stuff.

[01:56:26.050 --> 01:56:28.070]
They just hand you a sheet of paper with a bunch of words on it.

[01:56:28.310 --> 01:56:30.710]
You want to give the emphasis in the right spot, don't you?

[01:56:31.690 --> 01:56:32.250]
Sure, why not?

[01:56:32.390 --> 01:56:33.010]
Got it all, mighty.

[01:56:33.010 --> 01:56:34.210]
Our sales department blows.

[01:56:35.070 --> 01:56:35.590]
Let me say it again.

[01:56:35.670 --> 01:56:37.010]
We all know that Hurricane season is here.

[01:56:37.090 --> 01:56:38.250]
It is the 31st of June.

[01:56:38.370 --> 01:56:39.590]
That's what it says in my watch right now.

[01:56:39.950 --> 01:56:42.650]
Before Storm hits, you put up shutters to protect the windows and doors of your home.

[01:56:42.650 --> 01:56:45.050]
But what about the roof of your house, baby?

[01:56:45.590 --> 01:56:48.950]
The Somae paint factory makes roof mastic, a roof coating that can help you hurricane

[01:56:48.950 --> 01:56:49.650]
proof your roof.

[01:56:50.070 --> 01:56:53.730]
Somae's roof mastic saved hundreds and hundreds of roofs during hurricane Andrew while

[01:56:53.730 --> 01:56:57.270]
unprotected roofs were peeling off and flying away right on down the old Hershey highway.

[01:56:57.870 --> 01:57:00.850]
Somae's also got waterproof coatings for every kind of roof ever invented.

[01:57:01.170 --> 01:57:06.610]
So called the Somae paint factory at 305-63363333.

[01:57:06.610 --> 01:57:09.910]
The Somae paint factory is the oldest quality paint and waterproof coating manufacturer in

[01:57:09.910 --> 01:57:10.730]

[02:09:46.750 --> 02:09:46.750]

[02:09:46.750 --> 02:09:47.350]
I hope you run out to buy my book.

[02:09:47.350 --> 02:09:47.810]
I hope you run out to buy my book.

[02:09:47.810 --> 02:09:48.210]
I hope you run out to buy my book.

[02:09:48.210 --> 02:09:48.310]
I hope you run out to buy my book.

[02:09:48.310 --> 02:09:49.430]
I hope you run out to buy my book.

[02:09:49.430 --> 02:09:50.550]
I hope you run out to buy my book.

[02:09:50.550 --> 02:09:51.470]
I hope you run out to buy my book.

[02:09:51.470 --> 02:09:51.530]
I hope you run out to buy my book.

[02:09:51.530 --> 02:09:52.570]
I hope you run out to buy my book.

[02:09:52.570 --> 02:09:54.970]
I hope you run out to buy my book.

[02:09:54.970 --> 02:09:56.790]
I hope you run out to buy my book.

[02:09:56.790 --> 02:09:58.030]
Bill is such a horn dog.

[02:09:58.030 --> 02:10:00.950]
He probably would have never noticed I had man legs anyway.

[02:10:01.450 --> 02:10:01.870]
And Chelsea?

[02:10:02.270 --> 02:10:07.170]
Well, if you buy my book, you can read all about the affair I had with Santa Bernhard and our love child.

[02:10:07.570 --> 02:10:09.270]
Now, I wasn't born a Democrat.

[02:10:09.710 --> 02:10:13.330]
I switched parties after looking in the mirror and seeing the body of Tiponio.

[02:10:13.770 --> 02:10:14.570]
So buy my book.

[02:10:14.770 --> 02:10:16.570]
Now, because I can never have enough.

[02:10:17.010 --> 02:10:21.530]
If you order a copy today, I will personally autobat the all-newd scratches that fold out.

[02:10:22.090 --> 02:10:22.530]
We should.

[02:10:25.310 --> 02:10:26.230]
1245-560-W.

[02:10:26.350 --> 02:10:27.470]
Don't buy the book by the way.

[02:10:27.570 --> 02:10:28.310]
Save the 28 bucks.

[02:10:28.450 --> 02:10:28.730]
It sucks.

[02:10:28.870 --> 02:10:29.730]
She doesn't say a damn thing.

[02:10:29.830 --> 02:10:32.490]
And if you live long enough, you'll hear the entire book read right here on his show.

[02:10:32.870 --> 02:10:34.870]
Maybe we have to accelerate the apace of my reading it.

[02:10:34.950 --> 02:10:35.310]
No.

[02:10:36.630 --> 02:10:37.450]
No way, Jose.

[02:10:37.810 --> 02:10:38.310]
Is that a threat?

[02:10:39.130 --> 02:10:44.550]
Here's a fact from Jack who says I've never heard any mention of Jennifer Connellese performance in the movie The Hot Spot.

[02:10:44.710 --> 02:10:46.350]
Anyone seen it's supposed to be worth of it says.

[02:10:46.530 --> 02:10:48.490]
And the answer is, he missed my comment about it.

[02:10:48.890 --> 02:10:49.950]
And you said, bad movie.

[02:10:50.190 --> 02:10:50.770]
Good nudity.

[02:10:51.590 --> 02:10:53.390]
Good nudity, bad movie, including hers.

[02:10:55.450 --> 02:10:55.950]
Hers what?

[02:10:56.070 --> 02:10:57.050]
Her nudity or her form?

[02:10:57.290 --> 02:10:57.310]
Her nudity.

[02:10:57.610 --> 02:10:57.650]
Right.

[02:10:58.250 --> 02:11:02.810]
Oh, I don't remember the performance, but I do remember she showed her boobs and so did Virginia Madsen.

[02:11:03.210 --> 02:11:03.390]
Okay.

[02:11:03.490 --> 02:11:05.490]
So in other words, it depends on how horny and desperate you are.

[02:11:05.590 --> 02:11:07.810]
If you want to see Jennifer Connellese boobs or whatever, that's great.

[02:11:08.150 --> 02:11:09.290]
And there's one of the short of movie.

[02:11:09.810 --> 02:11:09.910]
Huh?

[02:11:10.130 --> 02:11:11.270]
Don Johnson is in that movie.

[02:11:11.710 --> 02:11:12.010]
Don Johnson?

[02:11:12.530 --> 02:11:12.770]
Yeah.

[02:11:13.950 --> 02:11:16.050]
Well, he was good in one movie in the boy's dog.

[02:11:16.050 --> 02:11:16.830]
And that was in the bad.

[02:11:16.930 --> 02:11:18.550]
Then we got that mommy vice stuff.

[02:11:18.570 --> 02:11:19.930]
And that was the end of Don Johnson.

[02:11:19.930 --> 02:11:21.630]
Then he became a real asshole.

[02:11:21.830 --> 02:11:22.750]
What a real attitude.

[02:11:23.650 --> 02:11:29.170]
And before you go to the one short thing for me, what that just say, freeze major, my

[02:11:29.170 --> 02:11:31.190]
any vice, you're under arrest, absolutely.

[02:11:31.430 --> 02:11:32.550]
I'm not going to do that.

[02:11:32.690 --> 02:11:33.070]
Oh, you.

[02:11:33.650 --> 02:11:34.250]
Oh, fine.

[02:11:34.590 --> 02:11:35.230]
I don't care.

[02:11:35.450 --> 02:11:36.050]
You won't you?

[02:11:36.330 --> 02:11:36.590]
Yes.

[02:11:36.890 --> 02:11:38.150]
Don Johnson, you're going to haircut.

[02:11:38.390 --> 02:11:38.690]
Thank you.

[02:11:38.770 --> 02:11:39.670]
Thank you.

[02:11:40.170 --> 02:11:40.690]
Hello.

[02:11:41.570 --> 02:11:42.090]
Hello.

[02:11:42.950 --> 02:11:42.950]

[02:11:43.270 --> 02:11:44.530]
Only here.

[02:11:45.530 --> 02:11:46.050]
Hello.

[02:11:46.430 --> 02:11:46.830]
Okay.

[02:11:47.370 --> 02:11:48.050]
Pardon me?

[02:11:48.550 --> 02:11:49.790]
I think that was gone.

[02:11:50.410 --> 02:11:51.130]
Do you notice that?

[02:11:52.890 --> 02:11:53.750]
Did you notice that?

[02:11:53.850 --> 02:11:53.950]
Yeah.

[02:11:54.370 --> 02:11:55.310]
I thought it like Johnson.

[02:11:55.530 --> 02:11:55.690]
No.

[02:11:55.990 --> 02:11:57.190]
He didn't.

[02:11:57.190 --> 02:11:58.310]
Isn't that incredible?

[02:11:58.990 --> 02:11:59.390]
Absolutely.

[02:12:00.290 --> 02:12:01.410]
He said no change.

[02:12:01.410 --> 02:12:02.830]
It sounds just like Don Johnson.

[02:12:03.690 --> 02:12:04.410]
What do you think, sir?

[02:12:05.250 --> 02:12:05.650]
I like that.

[02:12:05.890 --> 02:12:06.490]
He'll leave me.

[02:12:06.550 --> 02:12:06.790]
Okay.

[02:12:06.910 --> 02:12:07.270]
Thank you.

[02:12:07.530 --> 02:12:10.750]
If you look up the expression dreaming, living in a dream world in the dictionary, you'll see

[02:12:10.750 --> 02:12:12.110]
Stan Major's picture next to it.

[02:12:13.590 --> 02:12:16.970]
643 votes, being a boy, that's pretty impressive because being a boy keeps track of these

[02:12:16.970 --> 02:12:17.130]
things.

[02:12:17.270 --> 02:12:18.750]
He keeps his thumb on it all day long.

[02:12:19.290 --> 02:12:22.690]
Oh, really checking this thing especially now.

[02:12:23.670 --> 02:12:29.290]
The last thing I want to hear or hear about on the new Roger Show is sports, 141 pulling away,

[02:12:29.630 --> 02:12:35.970]
pulling away in a stretch, eating ass, 117, hockey, 103.

[02:12:37.890 --> 02:12:40.470]
I guess those three are like in a class by themselves, right?

[02:12:41.430 --> 02:12:41.870]
Oh, yeah.

[02:12:42.030 --> 02:12:42.890]
Oh, you're wrong, dude.

[02:12:42.990 --> 02:12:45.570]
You've got a lot of Panther fans, a lot of hockey fans are really knowledgeable.

[02:12:45.570 --> 02:12:46.790]
Remember, a gunp-orously?

[02:12:49.930 --> 02:12:51.710]
Oh, my goodness.

[02:12:52.630 --> 02:12:55.850]
More Howard David than 70, 10.8%.

[02:12:55.850 --> 02:12:56.850]
George 47.

[02:12:57.050 --> 02:12:58.210]
I don't think you're going to catch the moment.

[02:12:58.810 --> 02:12:59.450]
Wait till I get home.

[02:12:59.970 --> 02:13:01.330]
No, don't get dick with it.

[02:13:02.650 --> 02:13:04.830]
Music 41, you're pulling away from music which is good.

[02:13:04.890 --> 02:13:06.930]
In fact, if we get enough encouragement, I'm going to play some music.

[02:13:07.090 --> 02:13:07.750]
Correct the lead.

[02:13:08.010 --> 02:13:08.690]
That sounds good, huh?

[02:13:10.510 --> 02:13:10.970]
Wait a minute.

[02:13:11.470 --> 02:13:12.150]
Oh, please.

[02:13:14.250 --> 02:13:16.030]
Let me just reach right over here.

[02:13:16.770 --> 02:13:19.410]
I don't have like all bad taste of music.

[02:13:20.690 --> 02:13:21.850]
For example, huh?

[02:13:22.710 --> 02:13:24.790]
I think what it is they get up to when I play a lot of the old stuff.

[02:13:25.150 --> 02:13:26.370]
No, it's the boy band stuff.

[02:13:26.510 --> 02:13:27.230]
It's the gay stuff.

[02:13:27.390 --> 02:13:29.030]
I don't ever play that stuff on the air.

[02:13:29.170 --> 02:13:30.690]
I did, therefore, that was a long time ago.

[02:13:30.770 --> 02:13:31.990]
I played it when it was popular.

[02:13:32.350 --> 02:13:35.490]
When we had that real, that stuff, the TRL going.

[02:13:36.230 --> 02:13:37.410]
And that was a fun time.

[02:13:37.410 --> 02:13:39.150]
Like I said, a couple of weeks ago, there was some fun.

[02:13:39.150 --> 02:13:42.850]
I mean, maybe it wasn't great music, but people were into music at that time.

[02:13:42.910 --> 02:13:44.430]
We were into that show and we were into all that stuff.

[02:13:44.830 --> 02:13:47.530]
And a lot of flesh, yeah.

[02:13:48.590 --> 02:13:50.270]
And now what are they into crap again?

[02:13:51.490 --> 02:13:56.970]
Like even you just said the on Friday, the reason that the CD sales are down is because most of the music sucks.

[02:13:57.490 --> 02:13:59.570]
Who wants to pay for a swill?

[02:14:00.890 --> 02:14:02.090]
When you can steal us for free.

[02:14:06.010 --> 02:14:07.750]
How is there anybody that's like this song?

[02:14:09.890 --> 02:14:10.770]
I'll go out.

[02:14:13.050 --> 02:14:13.830]
I'll go out.

[02:14:16.690 --> 02:14:19.510]
You'd find somebody because this is a very sour group down there.

[02:14:19.590 --> 02:14:22.050]
You know, if I'm not a Shakira, she couldn't sing her out of a paper.

[02:14:22.270 --> 02:14:22.970]
She blows.

[02:14:23.890 --> 02:14:25.510]
Yeah, you only wish she blows, okay?

[02:14:25.830 --> 02:14:26.510]
I think she does.

[02:14:27.410 --> 02:14:28.590]
Well, she's Colombian.

[02:14:28.750 --> 02:14:29.390]
Well, I tell you one thing.

[02:14:29.450 --> 02:14:31.430]
That picture on the cover I never even noticed on.

[02:14:31.430 --> 02:14:36.210]
She's, well, I mean, I know she looks pretty good, but this picture is a spectacular picture.

[02:14:37.710 --> 02:14:40.010]
She looks really amazing in that picture.

[02:14:40.810 --> 02:14:41.890]
And then we could play a little bit of Vanna.

[02:14:42.950 --> 02:14:43.270]
Okay.

[02:14:43.650 --> 02:14:44.790]
It smells like teenage smegma.

[02:14:45.130 --> 02:14:45.690]
Got their new album?

[02:14:46.290 --> 02:14:47.730]
No, I don't.

[02:14:47.810 --> 02:14:48.710]
I have their old one.

[02:14:48.730 --> 02:14:49.650]
It's more than enough for me.

[02:14:51.270 --> 02:14:53.190]
Oh, let's not get into a discussion of that again.

[02:14:53.270 --> 02:14:53.910]
What's the point?

[02:14:55.450 --> 02:14:58.370]
And then we could finish up our one hit wonder stuff from last year.

[02:14:58.370 --> 02:14:59.310]
We never finished that up.

[02:14:59.310 --> 02:15:00.770]
We're waiting all the stuff in the drawer.

[02:15:00.770 --> 02:15:02.190]
I got those lists that we went through.

[02:15:02.490 --> 02:15:04.010]
We'll be blew off almost a whole audience.

[02:15:04.810 --> 02:15:05.210]
Huh?

[02:15:07.090 --> 02:15:11.690]
And I got a bunch of these CDs that I went and I've wasted all that money on, but I'll never play again if I live in B500.

[02:15:11.890 --> 02:15:13.830]
I gotta get a change in my pocket.

[02:15:14.150 --> 02:15:16.170]
Go and sing a little thing.

[02:15:16.730 --> 02:15:18.170]
Don't you want to tell a whole thing?

[02:15:19.010 --> 02:15:20.370]
I give you a way.

[02:15:20.790 --> 02:15:22.390]
At least tell a child.

[02:15:22.890 --> 02:15:24.390]
I get to save a whole thing.

[02:15:24.830 --> 02:15:26.690]
I'll let go of these things.

[02:15:26.690 --> 02:15:28.690]
So I think basically that's the choice for the audience.

[02:15:28.750 --> 02:15:31.170]
Either Neil's music, the rest of the week, or the audio from Batman.

[02:15:33.030 --> 02:15:35.730]
I had to get rid of the robin so that we could use the phone.

[02:15:36.650 --> 02:15:38.030]
32 pussy foot road.

[02:15:38.470 --> 02:15:38.710]
What?

[02:15:38.970 --> 02:15:39.930]
Far from Wayne Manor.

[02:15:40.650 --> 02:15:42.570]
He said, don't pussy foot around, Robin.

[02:15:42.870 --> 02:15:43.470]
Something like that.

[02:15:44.250 --> 02:15:47.670]
See, I thought at least this would be one show that would be safe to have the audience.

[02:15:48.410 --> 02:15:49.830]
Oh, you can't tell no more, you know?

[02:15:51.370 --> 02:15:54.650]
There, every day where you look, because all this photographic crap going on.

[02:15:54.650 --> 02:15:57.750]
Thank God we got that FCC up there to really crack down.

[02:15:57.990 --> 02:15:58.630]
That's it.

[02:15:59.930 --> 02:16:01.370]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[02:16:01.570 --> 02:16:02.810]
I've got a Bill Clinton article.

[02:16:03.030 --> 02:16:03.490]
Can you believe that?

[02:16:04.470 --> 02:16:05.190]
I believe it.

[02:16:05.890 --> 02:16:07.110]
Bill Clinton wrote this article.

[02:16:07.110 --> 02:16:09.110]
I was printed in the New York Daily News on Saturday.

[02:16:09.890 --> 02:16:13.110]
And it's the headline is Out of Control by Bubba.

[02:16:14.350 --> 02:16:16.690]
It's your money says President Bush when he promotes tax cuts.

[02:16:17.010 --> 02:16:19.290]
I disagree with this tax policy, but admire his spin.

[02:16:20.090 --> 02:16:21.850]
The same argument applies with greater force,

[02:16:21.850 --> 02:16:25.070]
where the big media conglomerate should be allowed to control more television and radio stations.

[02:16:25.410 --> 02:16:26.230]
It's your airwaves.

[02:16:27.290 --> 02:16:32.570]
The American people own the bandwidth that broadcast media companies used to deliver programs to our TV and radio sets.

[02:16:32.770 --> 02:16:37.510]
Because the space on that bandwidth is limited, the FCC regulates who has access to our eyes and ears.

[02:16:37.850 --> 02:16:42.310]
For more than 60 years, the FCC allowed companies to own a number of local TV stations,

[02:16:42.570 --> 02:16:46.570]
provided that no single company owned enough to reach more than 35% of the population of the US.

[02:16:47.110 --> 02:16:51.630]
But on June 2nd, by a three to two vote, the FCC raised the limit to 45%,

[02:16:51.630 --> 02:16:55.310]
giving big media firms the chance to gobble up many more local TV stations.

[02:16:55.630 --> 02:17:01.310]
In fact, a single time corporation will be able to control up to three of the TV stations in America's nine largest cities.

[02:17:02.290 --> 02:17:06.110]
The FCC also opened the door to local TV newspaper mergers in many places,

[02:17:06.370 --> 02:17:08.610]
so you'll be getting your news and information from the same company,

[02:17:08.670 --> 02:17:11.450]
regardless of whether you're tuning on the TV or opening up your newspaper.

[02:17:12.070 --> 02:17:12.950]
Why is this bad?

[02:17:12.950 --> 02:17:18.110]
Because more monolithic control over local media will reduce the diversity of information that opinion and entertainment people get.

[02:17:18.510 --> 02:17:22.270]
Interesting local coverage will be supplanted by the lowest common denominator in your mass market, mush.

[02:17:23.090 --> 02:17:26.510]
But don't cable TV in the Internet give people more sources of information?

[02:17:26.850 --> 02:17:29.030]
In theory, yes, in practice, not necessarily.

[02:17:29.410 --> 02:17:33.590]
Big media firms own most of the cable networks and supply much of the content for major internet sites.

[02:17:34.330 --> 02:17:36.470]
Is this another Democrat versus Republican battle?

[02:17:36.790 --> 02:17:40.370]
Is my concern motivated by the growing influence of right-wing voices in the broadcast media?

[02:17:40.870 --> 02:17:46.050]
While it's true the FCC votes for the long party lines and Republicans for looser standards, Democrats against,

[02:17:46.390 --> 02:17:49.690]
and while I have noticed the conservative slant and morbid organizations these days,

[02:17:50.050 --> 02:17:51.970]
the debate over media ownership isn't a partisan one.

[02:17:53.570 --> 02:18:05.370]
Organizations from the National Organization for Women's of the National Rifle Association have spoken out against what the FCC decided to do more than 750,000 Americans of all political persuasions registered their opinion of the new rules with the FCC,

[02:18:05.670 --> 02:18:07.330]
and nearly 100% of them were opposed.

[02:18:08.290 --> 02:18:14.530]
The lack of diversity independence in the broadcast media may be why it didn't hear much about this big issue on TV or radio in recent months.

[02:18:15.050 --> 02:18:19.270]
But the opposition is truly a grassroots movement and won't go away even if it's not on the evening news,

[02:18:19.630 --> 02:18:22.310]
and the voice of the people is beginning to be heard at least on Capitol Hill.

[02:18:23.390 --> 02:18:31.210]
The Senate Commerce Committee acted quickly after the FCC vote to approve legislation on a bipartisan basis that would reinstate more sensible media ownership rules.

[02:18:31.210 --> 02:18:38.410]
All the Republicans as well as Democrats opposed the FCC decision, it's unclear whether the Commerce Committee legislation can pass the full Senate or in the House.

[02:18:39.070 --> 02:18:44.550]
The FCC ruling also faces challenges in the courts, but there's no guarantee the Commission's error will be corrected any time soon.

[02:18:44.950 --> 02:18:46.650]
Therefore, Congress is our best hope.

[02:18:47.550 --> 02:18:54.230]
Whatever your political philosophy of your favorite competition and diversity in the media, you should call, write, or email your senators and representatives.

[02:18:54.230 --> 02:19:09.590]
The stakes are high, and issues as FCC Commissioner Michael Cops is whether a few corporations will be seated in hand skate keeper control over the civil dialogue of our country, more content control over our music entertainment information, veto power over the majority of what our families watch here and read.

[02:19:10.250 --> 02:19:16.570]
People joke about my liking McDonald's and I do, but actually I prefer to go down to Lang's Dilly, a great family establishment near my house.

[02:19:16.570 --> 02:19:24.570]
In the brave new world being defined by the FCC, there will be more mic media on our airwaves and far fewer broadcast equivalents of our favorite local diners.

[02:19:25.050 --> 02:19:29.210]
Unlike restaurants, the airwaves belong to us. We shouldn't give up our right to have more choice.

[02:19:29.430 --> 02:19:30.090]
Nice going, Baba.

[02:19:30.230 --> 02:19:32.110]
Oh, do we miss him badly or what?

[02:19:32.290 --> 02:19:33.510]
Yeah. God.

[02:19:36.770 --> 02:19:41.950]
Although I would like to point out that it was under his watch in 96 or 7, whatever the hell he or was, that they started with his crap.

[02:19:41.950 --> 02:19:50.970]
Would his do happily and triumphant under his watch when he was president, but nevertheless better late than never. Nice going, Baba.

[02:19:51.590 --> 02:19:52.930]
Do we miss him bad or why?

[02:19:53.110 --> 02:19:58.910]
See, I'd be interested in reading a book that he wrote, not to worry, who quite frankly, if I never saw that, but you're going to be too soon.

[02:19:59.090 --> 02:20:00.950]
Oh, you shouldn't say that, Neil. Why?

[02:20:01.790 --> 02:20:02.950]
That's the way I feel about her.

[02:20:03.050 --> 02:20:09.330]
She's to say small potatoes would be an insult to those little potatoes that we can never think of the names of those little whatever those are.

[02:20:09.330 --> 02:20:11.250]
Right. Those little ones.

[02:20:12.590 --> 02:20:14.510]
Whatever those things are, like potato.

[02:20:14.550 --> 02:20:18.930]
It's an insult to the small potatoes to call him every small potato. She's less than that.

[02:20:19.310 --> 02:20:26.590]
She's insignificant in the course of human events. Well, she said it from near a big stick and all of a sudden now she talks a big game.

[02:20:26.650 --> 02:20:33.510]
Didn't she vote to give the president a power to go in there to work with this illegal war? Now that she's foaming at the mouth about.

[02:20:34.130 --> 02:20:41.110]
Yeah, she sure as hell did she jumped on the bandwagon. She's an opportunist, a carpet bagging opportunist, uh, ice princess bitch.

[02:20:41.690 --> 02:20:47.270]
I think that's something I'm pretty nicely if you ask me and her book sucks, but other than that, she's a dynamo.

[02:20:48.630 --> 02:20:54.530]
The last thing I want to hear or hear about on the near Roger show is we've got a staggering response.

[02:20:55.910 --> 02:20:59.910]
665 volts and we still got an hour to go. Aren't you impressed? Yeah, sure.

[02:21:00.330 --> 02:21:02.070]
Bonehead boy. Very.

[02:21:04.150 --> 02:21:14.370]
Oh, I said impressed not idiotic sports 148 eating ass 119. But you were really putting on a big run there for while now all of a sudden the sports has pulled away.

[02:21:14.370 --> 02:21:26.450]
Hockey, although there might be some slap over hockey 104, Mohawar, David, it's 72 George moving up nicely 48 steadily climbing climbing, use it 41.

[02:21:26.850 --> 02:21:37.070]

[02:21:46.430 --> 02:21:52.050]
See if we could just hear them speak on the internet. You want to sit on our website the response on our website fabulous the phone sucks.

[02:21:53.510 --> 02:21:58.610]

It's the one to two hours.

[02:23:35.670 --> 02:23:39.090]
Sure you're a fat homophobic racist. But hey, don't despair.

[02:23:39.630 --> 02:23:45.310]
Now there's an extremist way to lose weight, introducing Papu can and boost step into the oldies.

[02:23:45.310 --> 02:23:48.970]
Let's ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, come on, let those legs.

Yes sir. Get those knees in the breeze.

[02:24:00.370 --> 02:24:05.950]
Yes, now you can start the insanity with Papu can and boost step into oldies.

[02:24:06.230 --> 02:24:07.670]
Ask for it by secret hamshank.

[02:24:08.010 --> 02:24:14.510]
It's a minute after one at five, five sixty WQ. I'm happy Monday two. The man dogs coming up at two, Hank in the studio 4 to 630.

[02:24:20.390 --> 02:24:20.830]
Oh right.

[02:24:20.910 --> 02:24:24.090]
Peter five and a.m. Before Mo Mo one jail.

[02:24:24.410 --> 02:24:24.770]
Absolutely.

[02:24:26.230 --> 02:24:29.590]
Five six seven oh five sixty good article in time magazine. It's on our website.

[02:24:29.590 --> 02:24:33.010]
I'm not going to read it because it's way too long and I don't want to do a lot of reading.

[02:24:33.110 --> 02:24:35.290]
Do we want to do a lot of bedtime story? No, that's no fun.

[02:24:36.470 --> 02:24:38.110]
No fun at all. It might be too informative.

[02:24:38.590 --> 02:24:44.230]
But anyway time magazines Sunday June 29th as in yesterday who lost the WMD is the weapons out and testifies.

[02:24:44.370 --> 02:24:50.690]
So does the finger pointing a preview of the coming battle by Massimo Calibrecy and Tim Timothy J burger.

[02:24:51.830 --> 02:24:53.110]
Obviously come from different hoods.

[02:24:54.290 --> 02:24:56.470]
Five day we get a call yet about once upon a time in America.

[02:24:56.650 --> 02:24:59.750]
Oh, nothing about what? Oh like somebody that's seen the new one.

[02:25:00.230 --> 02:25:02.090]
No, not the new one that even the old one.

[02:25:02.090 --> 02:25:04.910]
If we forget about the new one, the ending is the same. Why shouldn't I say that?

[02:25:05.570 --> 02:25:06.590]
The ending is the same.

[02:25:08.650 --> 02:25:10.830]
It still ends with that look on his post.

[02:25:13.790 --> 02:25:16.530]
He's singing past the pipe or something like that.

[02:25:16.710 --> 02:25:17.190]
Water pipe.

[02:25:17.750 --> 02:25:19.630]
That's it WQ I am.

[02:25:25.830 --> 02:25:27.190]
He was headed down to her to you.

[02:25:27.410 --> 02:25:32.230]
Hey there, the best. Don't be knocking our callers. Okay. WQ I am.

[02:25:32.230 --> 02:25:35.490]
Hey, Nail. Yes, sir. How you doing today? Pretty good.

[02:25:35.770 --> 02:25:41.450]
Hey, I saw that I once upon a time in America. And this is entertaining.

[02:25:42.370 --> 02:25:45.710]
That one little kid. The one gets killed.

[02:25:46.090 --> 02:25:47.410]
It looked like Ralph Macho.

[02:25:48.090 --> 02:25:49.990]
Yeah, he did, but it wasn't him. But it did.

[02:25:50.090 --> 02:25:53.410]
I thought that too. Yeah. I couldn't. I couldn't.

[02:25:53.450 --> 02:25:56.210]
It couldn't have been because the movie was 84, which is 16.

[02:25:56.350 --> 02:25:59.530]
I know. Right. Right. But boy, that kid was a ringer for him.

[02:25:59.530 --> 02:26:00.930]
You're right. Yeah. I thought that too.

[02:26:01.550 --> 02:26:04.550]
Hey, I thought I'd recommend for a dream this weekend. Yeah.

[02:26:05.030 --> 02:26:09.350]
Oh, man. That's the one time heavy, heavy duty. Yeah.

[02:26:09.530 --> 02:26:11.510]
You only see that movie once. That's enough.

[02:26:11.870 --> 02:26:13.990]
Make sure you want to put those purple ones right back on the shelf.

[02:26:14.410 --> 02:26:17.250]
Man, she was called Alan Burst and this incredible. And that was.

[02:26:17.930 --> 02:26:20.330]
It was actually was great acting all around.

[02:26:20.390 --> 02:26:24.090]
Even the Marlins kid was doing the way in. He did a good job.

[02:26:24.470 --> 02:26:25.470]
He did a great job.

[02:26:25.470 --> 02:26:27.110]
I'm right. I'm right. I'm right.

[02:26:27.670 --> 02:26:29.250]
Thank you, pal. I have a great life.

[02:26:29.810 --> 02:26:31.470]
Here's a guy. So once upon a time in America,

[02:26:32.950 --> 02:26:37.450]
5 6 7 0 5 60, 5 5 60 on the 80.

[02:26:37.690 --> 02:26:40.730]
But we don't want to get into a big long conversation about the significance of what it

[02:26:40.730 --> 02:26:43.750]
mattered about the opium dream and all this.

[02:26:43.810 --> 02:26:46.050]
We don't want to get into that. Do we? No. No, because that's long and

[02:26:46.050 --> 02:26:48.230]
progress. Most people haven't seen it. Anyway, it's too freaking long.

[02:26:48.570 --> 02:26:52.310]
People don't have the patience to sit down and watch a long, long drawn out movie.

[02:26:52.310 --> 02:26:56.050]
You know, took me three tries. I mean, maybe the Debbie does Dallas

[02:26:56.210 --> 02:26:59.710]
ology. They might sit still for that.

[02:26:59.710 --> 02:27:01.130]
WQ I am.

[02:27:01.170 --> 02:27:02.570]
Hey, Neil. What's going on, man?

[02:27:02.570 --> 02:27:03.790]
How are you doing, sir?

[02:27:03.890 --> 02:27:06.050]
Have you, did you check out that article in Seed Link?

[02:27:06.050 --> 02:27:10.050]
It was the same article about two pages after the for all article about the DEA

[02:27:10.050 --> 02:27:12.130]
closing down the Bung Shop.

[02:27:12.130 --> 02:27:16.030]
No. I remember we saw on the other side of the page. There was an advertisement for a

[02:27:16.210 --> 02:27:20.210]
Bung Shop. It was very cool. How American the DEA shutting down the Bung Shop?

[02:27:20.210 --> 02:27:20.510]
It sounds real American to me.

[02:27:20.510 --> 02:27:23.870]
All right. Take it easy, Neil. Thanks for the good news. Okay. There you go.

[02:27:24.730 --> 02:27:28.410]
Shunning down the Bung Shop because God only knows what kind of crap those people be smoking.

[02:27:28.510 --> 02:27:30.690]
That's the American fucking way. You got it.

[02:27:31.190 --> 02:27:35.370]
The DEA has taken everybody away. I'm sick and terribly.

[02:27:35.530 --> 02:27:39.150]
I'm all repression, all the bull crap, all the right wingers and the public sits back and goes.

[02:27:40.230 --> 02:27:43.910]
Just like that. That's what they don't care. They're too busy.

[02:27:45.710 --> 02:27:49.510]
5, 6, 7, 05. I mean, with the fact that we couldn't even get Jeff Bush out in Florida.

[02:27:49.510 --> 02:27:53.730]
Was that tell you? I mean, I mean, God.

[02:27:54.210 --> 02:27:57.630]
The guy practically stands up there and says, hey, I got devious plans.

[02:27:57.810 --> 02:27:59.790]
I'm a liar. I don't care what you voted on that class.

[02:27:59.830 --> 02:28:02.410]
I lied through my teeth. I'm going to do whatever the hell I want.

[02:28:02.550 --> 02:28:05.910]
We stole the election and screw you. Hey, let's vote them back in again.

[02:28:07.570 --> 02:28:10.110]
There is absolutely no hope for the state of Florida.

[02:28:10.370 --> 02:28:13.630]
That's why you don't have no casino gambling. That's why you have a governor who's a Bozo

[02:28:13.630 --> 02:28:16.390]
and his brother is a even bigger Bozo, a president day.

[02:28:16.390 --> 02:28:20.070]
And of course, this one, they're grooming to be his successor and his son George as in the pee.

[02:28:20.590 --> 02:28:24.270]
He's going to be the one after that. Isn't it amazing how he had the Kennedys doing the same thing?

[02:28:24.570 --> 02:28:28.510]
Yeah. Two terms for John, two terms for Bobby and two terms for Teddy.

[02:28:28.710 --> 02:28:30.390]
They had it all drawn up there on their roadmap.

[02:28:30.790 --> 02:28:34.450]
Roadmap to a dictatorship, but they weren't nearly as evil.

[02:28:37.350 --> 02:28:40.870]
No, they were better crooks though. Right. Don't you think?

[02:28:41.950 --> 02:28:46.250]
Oh, they were crooks. The old man, I mean, you know, we talk about the George Prescott.

[02:28:46.250 --> 02:28:49.090]
What was his name? The old one, Herbert Walker, Prescott, whatever.

[02:28:49.310 --> 02:28:51.270]
Prescott Bush. That was his name, the Nazi.

[02:28:53.990 --> 02:28:58.070]
Well, it runs in a family or snickering, but I guess I should have been more specific when I said the Nazi.

[02:28:58.310 --> 02:29:00.030]
It's the original Nazi. The grandpa.

[02:29:01.230 --> 02:29:05.530]
And then of course, you had Joe Kennedy, the bootlegger, the rum runner,

[02:29:06.550 --> 02:29:09.450]
who never made a legal penny in his life.

[02:29:12.270 --> 02:29:17.790]
The bottom line of the story is boys and girls that the people who are honest very rarely get ahead in this country.

[02:29:17.950 --> 02:29:20.770]
They just made market some head, but they very rarely get ahead.

[02:29:20.830 --> 02:29:23.530]
You have to be a crook. You have to lie. You have to cheat. You have to be full of crap.

[02:29:23.670 --> 02:29:28.250]
You have to pull all the right strings, smear the right hands, and then you get into a real strong place like George.

[02:29:30.450 --> 02:29:31.550]
Nobody can Q.A.M.?

[02:29:31.550 --> 02:29:35.010]
What the f**k are mass destruction? Oh, I...

[02:29:37.710 --> 02:29:43.210]
See, and you're knocking our calls? What's wrong with you? WQ.A.M.?

[02:29:43.950 --> 02:29:44.430]
Jamba?

[02:29:47.450 --> 02:29:48.430]
WQ.A.M.?

[02:29:50.070 --> 02:29:50.890]
There he was.

[02:29:51.030 --> 02:29:56.990]
Now, there we go. There's Gilbert Solomon right there, who just can't restrain himself,

[02:29:57.290 --> 02:30:01.590]
who's bugging our buddy for real in the tea room, which by the way, quit bugging people in the tea room, you asshole.

[02:30:01.590 --> 02:30:06.950]
And is back under again, which we have to keep dumping him, because he keeps saying the f-word on the year.

[02:30:07.690 --> 02:30:15.230]
Gilbert Solomon, which if our management had any balls at all, he'd be in the place where Beatr Boer was last weekend.

[02:30:15.990 --> 02:30:17.890]
He'd be cool in this freaking goofy heels.

[02:30:20.750 --> 02:30:25.270]
Gilbert Solomon won't stop. This man needs to be in a rubber room somewhere without a phone.

[02:30:25.610 --> 02:30:27.870]
And we don't have any support from our people there in management.

[02:30:27.870 --> 02:30:32.290]
All we get is a bunch of assholes sitting around having meetings deciding who they're going to stick in here to fill in

[02:30:32.290 --> 02:30:35.510]
in the starting next week Monday, Wednesday and Friday. I already made my case on that.

[02:30:37.090 --> 02:30:39.870]
We're having no more conversation about that. The book is closed.

[02:30:42.830 --> 02:30:46.610]
56670560.560 on the AT&T in Verizon line. WQ.A.M.

[02:30:47.070 --> 02:30:48.170]
Hi, can I talk to Neil?

[02:30:48.550 --> 02:30:52.210]
Speaking. Hi, Neil. I'd like to... is this place to put somebody on the pole?

[02:30:52.870 --> 02:30:53.470]
No, it's not.

[02:30:53.930 --> 02:30:55.450]
Oh, very good. How about...

[02:30:55.450 --> 02:30:57.630]

[02:30:57.990 --> 02:30:59.390]
What? What, what, what, what?

[02:31:01.710 --> 02:31:04.710]
You have to be joking me. You want to put Farrell on there?

[02:31:05.710 --> 02:31:09.530]
He's like a flon, like you said earlier, just a little bidal, do you?

[02:31:10.190 --> 02:31:11.790]
OK. Too much, too much for him.

[02:31:11.830 --> 02:31:14.810]
OK, well put him on there. Thanks, Pellet. Let's get Farrell on there, what do you say?

[02:31:15.370 --> 02:31:17.370]
We don't want him to get a big swollen head.

[02:31:19.530 --> 02:31:20.870]
We don't want him getting out of control.

[02:31:20.870 --> 02:31:25.150]
You know, I mean there have to be some people out there that can't stand in the fight and repulsed up noxious and

[02:31:25.150 --> 02:31:27.350]
Dominating and overbearing right?

[02:31:27.730 --> 02:31:31.930]
I guess well, what do you mean you guess don't be wishy washy?

[02:31:31.930 --> 02:31:35.130]
I mean you want to get all the negative votes or what you're just looking for attention

[02:40:25.830 --> 02:40:31.550]
British foreign secretary Jack Struss at Friday. He stood by the accuracy of government intelligence on Iraqi weapons as a new pool indicated

[02:40:31.550 --> 02:40:37.370]
That public disenchanted over the matter across the labor party. It's lead over the conservatives for the first time in eleven years

[02:40:39.470 --> 02:40:45.230]
Tony Blair has taken the pipe baby. We're not talking about the one at the Robert the Niro head and once upon a time

[02:40:46.630 --> 02:40:51.110]
Structural the House of Common Select Committee on Foreign Affairs that a disputed claimant intelligence dossier that

[02:40:51.110 --> 02:40:56.750]
Sodom was saying could unleash an unconventional weapons attack in 45 minutes and come from a credible intelligence source

[02:40:56.750 --> 02:41:04.870]
He also denied allegations have been added to the document to a embellish the findings and support Prime Minister Blair's argument that direct represented an immediate threat

[02:41:04.870 --> 02:41:15.310]
The committee is investigating charges that the government impulated intelligence to exaggerate the menace that Sodom and his weapons pose to justify military action and a story goes on

[02:41:16.410 --> 02:41:20.030]
How do you like that Tony Blair in deep political do do you know?

[02:41:20.810 --> 02:41:27.110]
I have a feeling that a year and a half from now the same could be here. We can only cross our legs and in eyes and pray and fingers

[02:41:28.030 --> 02:41:33.050]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the 18 T and Verizon line WQAM

[02:41:33.570 --> 02:41:37.890]
How about the L. Yes, how are you okay?

[02:41:38.270 --> 02:41:46.270]
Hey, did you see the movie when we were giants? No, no, you never saw that movie. You like history movies?

[02:41:48.030 --> 02:41:54.170]
Sometimes that's a good that's a good history movie. What is the bad? It's a World War two. It's about the big three

[02:41:54.790 --> 02:41:58.150]
I'm a PR and Rose and Roosevelt and

[02:41:58.650 --> 02:41:59.990]
Staling Island and

[02:42:00.630 --> 02:42:03.430]
If they are in Roosevelt and Kurt Hill and Ston the big four

[02:42:03.430 --> 02:42:07.910]
I saw it and you know if you like a movie it was strictly about dialogue

[02:42:07.910 --> 02:42:12.810]
If you know about all the phone calls between all the leaders and everything and you know

[02:42:13.290 --> 02:42:16.010]
It's more like a play. It's not like a movie with action

[02:42:16.010 --> 02:42:19.470]
But what it does show is it shows a lot of World War

[02:42:20.790 --> 02:42:21.230]
Photograph

[02:42:22.230 --> 02:42:27.670]
Actual footage of World War two through the movie as you know as we you know going through Africa and then going of course

[02:42:27.670 --> 02:42:29.250]
Normandy get back France and all that

[02:42:29.830 --> 02:42:35.730]
But you know it's a three hour movie, but I mean you'll enjoy it. The Bob Hoskins has Churchill and

[02:42:35.730 --> 02:42:37.490]
I think it's

[02:42:38.450 --> 02:42:40.730]
That guy's name. P. Me Herman is Stalin

[02:42:41.650 --> 02:42:48.170]

Palm 5 60 on it. You know, Geldy was talking about watching Willie maze play in our Geldy

[02:43:09.890 --> 02:43:16.730]

Oh, uh, no seriously like

[02:43:20.190 --> 02:43:23.550]
He was I think in 73 is when Willie maize returned

[02:43:23.550 --> 02:43:25.630]
So he was three years old

[02:43:26.670 --> 02:43:30.510]
Now do you remember what you watched when you were two and three years old? No, no

[02:43:31.830 --> 02:43:35.050]
Carla, I'm Geldy, but the fact that you're a punk why don't you just admit it? Okay?

[02:43:35.350 --> 02:43:41.050]
You didn't see you a Willie maize make that great basket catch off vickwards in the 1954 World Series in which the giants

[02:43:41.950 --> 02:43:46.510]
Shot the universe by sweeping the Indians forced rate dusty roads with a pinch hit homeruns

[02:43:57.730 --> 02:44:02.050]
Well, I saw Willie maize make that great catch in 54 of course. That was along before I was born but

[02:53:15.540 --> 02:53:20.280]
Makes me puke but nevertheless if it was a pretty good flick. I still might watch it Robert Downey Jr

[02:53:20.840 --> 02:53:24.440]
Robert time he oh can't stand him but again if it was a good flick right

[02:53:25.300 --> 02:53:28.340]
Didn't he wasn't he in a good movie with the Kano Reeves? There's another one makes me sick

[02:53:28.340 --> 02:53:30.560]
But that one about on the roof where they had the broad tied up

[02:53:30.560 --> 02:53:32.700]
I can never think of the name of that you don't know what I'm talking about

[02:53:32.700 --> 02:53:35.600]
No, but I think they were both in that one at least Kano Reeves would

[02:53:35.600 --> 02:53:39.580]
But anyway, there are plenty of people I'm not too crazy about but it would have to be

[02:53:40.360 --> 02:53:43.480]
Somebody that are really just despised to make that absolute

[02:53:44.120 --> 02:53:48.240]
Draw the line in the sand and say if they're in it, I'm not gonna see it. Will Smith is in that category

[02:53:50.400 --> 02:53:51.820]
Have we ever done that pull?

[02:53:53.320 --> 02:53:57.080]
I don't know if we've done that exactly. I think we're doing that tomorrow good

[02:53:57.480 --> 02:54:01.120]
Is that a movie pole? Does that qualify as a movie pole? Uh-oh

[02:54:01.120 --> 02:54:02.120]
Uh-oh

[02:54:03.940 --> 02:54:09.580]
I don't give a crap what a quality qualify it qualifies as being something timely and we'll get a lot of response on it

[02:54:09.600 --> 02:54:14.120]
And quite frankly, let's see tomorrow's Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday, you know

[02:54:14.120 --> 02:54:17.760]
I'm just writing out the tide here, you know

[02:54:18.660 --> 02:54:21.920]
That's right. You see having no like Natalie Wood I'm right going out with the tide

[02:54:21.920 --> 02:54:27.880]
The quota time of Bob and Tom bid I wish we still had that that was a great bit remember that

[02:54:28.340 --> 02:54:28.940]
How'd it go?

[02:54:30.020 --> 02:54:33.580]
It's something about Natalie Wood when I was the tide away. It was one of those

[02:54:33.580 --> 02:54:37.900]
These CDs, it's not on there. It's an old Bob and Tom anyway

[02:54:39.600 --> 02:54:43.620]
The point I'm throughout the house I sang before you move me again. Oh the movie pole tomorrow

[02:54:43.620 --> 02:54:47.340]
He always tried to throw me off to make it seem like I'm a daughtering old man, which I am

[02:54:47.340 --> 02:54:50.340]
But I don't want to see that way. I have to keep putting on a good act

[02:54:51.500 --> 02:54:56.860]
Tomorrow we do the movie pole the actor actors who absolutely if they were in the movie you wouldn't go see it under any circumstances

[02:54:56.860 --> 02:54:58.740]
And that's my choice. Will Smith

[02:54:59.140 --> 02:55:06.840]
Spill it with THRFF. However you like to spell it. It still smells the same. He is just obnoxious and arrogant and he thinks his stuff don't stink

[02:55:06.840 --> 02:55:08.780]
And plus he don't have any talent

[02:55:09.600 --> 02:55:17.640]
Can he sing? Can he act? Well, where's the talent? You should see six degrees of separation just so you can see how bad a movie can be yeah

[02:55:18.580 --> 02:55:21.540]
What a pseudo intellectual piece of tripe

[02:55:22.140 --> 02:55:27.120]
What is it about? Faggery. So how are to have commercial about Faggery and how great it is

[02:55:28.860 --> 02:55:34.260]
With Will Smith. Yeah as a fag. No, no, we don't want him. We got enough problems already

[02:55:34.260 --> 02:55:36.200]
We got Bob Coons and we got a bunch of other right, you know

[02:55:36.660 --> 02:55:37.920]
We don't want him at all

[02:55:38.580 --> 02:55:41.920]
Send it back to his lovely wife. He does have a beautiful wife. What's your name? Cheetah

You know something I'm putting it down will take suggestions right now. I'm putting that down for other

[03:04:13.760 --> 03:04:18.800]
In fact in you know what I agree. I wouldn't watch it either and I did see him in

[03:04:19.760 --> 03:04:23.880]
What's eating Gilbert great, but he was a perfect role in that because he played a retard

[03:04:25.520 --> 03:04:30.040]
Well, if Gilbert was in there was a retard for sure. Okay. Thanks for the art have a great day

[03:04:30.040 --> 03:04:34.100]
Okay, that's a good one Leo DiCaprio. That's that's on my list. I've got a short choice

[03:04:34.100 --> 03:04:36.560]
Is a matter of fact who was the other one I was talking about

[03:04:37.820 --> 03:04:40.400]
What's that? Which will Smith? Well, no

[03:04:40.400 --> 03:04:45.140]
I would watch a movie with Will Smith before I would watch Leo DiCaprio. I will not do it

[03:04:46.160 --> 03:04:48.580]
I mean to me he is such a screaming

[03:04:49.240 --> 03:04:55.320]
Minsing embarrassing faggot. I can't even begin to and then of course the tabloids always was seen with 15 women in his apartment

[03:04:55.320 --> 03:04:59.280]
Yeah, right and then then if you read if you read a little bit further down in the story

[03:04:59.280 --> 03:05:03.160]
While there were like six lesbians out on the balcony and there was the only other people seen in the apartment

[03:05:03.160 --> 03:05:06.740]
I mean come on are you fooling anybody Leo give me a break

[03:05:07.380 --> 03:05:11.180]
Oh, he makes math Damon look like Hercules. I'll leave Madelow. I like mad Damon

[03:05:11.180 --> 03:05:17.620]
Even you like some of his movies right and why do I mention him in the same breath? I don't know that was bad

[03:05:17.620 --> 03:05:19.400]
I apologize mad I apologize

[03:05:20.400 --> 03:05:25.360]
Look at what we got on it pull an even eight eight oh oh

[03:05:25.360 --> 03:05:26.840]
oh 100

[03:05:28.480 --> 03:05:30.920]
Wow, and you know what we got all over two Scott Farrell

[03:05:32.040 --> 03:05:34.560]
We got our lead in now. We got our tended to back

[03:05:35.600 --> 03:05:38.860]
We're making some progress and of course it all depends on who gets the diaries

[03:05:39.640 --> 03:05:42.920]
The spring books already over ended like 12 days ago June 18

[03:05:43.640 --> 03:05:48.620]
So we'll see how to fall out was we'll see if our people got the diaries if they were loyal if they're back on a show now

[03:05:48.620 --> 03:05:53.420]
It's tended to if we're making a comeback or if Greg read like just stuck that thing right through our heart like Dracula

[03:05:53.860 --> 03:05:54.720]
That's how I feel

[03:05:55.560 --> 03:06:00.540]
Like somebody stuck me with a spear right through my back. Oh, that's how I feel Greg with a 9-1 crab

[03:06:01.640 --> 03:06:06.140]
Just took the energy just like pulling a guy named plug out of the hot balloon

[03:06:06.140 --> 03:06:10.560]
And now like somebody blew it back into us. You know it a little blowback

[03:06:12.440 --> 03:06:19.600]
What 151 at 560 WQ we got the mad dog Jim Madd. It's gonna talk some Marlon crap. I sure hope not talk football

[03:06:19.600 --> 03:06:22.860]
I don't want to tell you about what to talk about don't talk about the marlins. It's so boring

[03:06:22.860 --> 03:06:28.320]
You see the fact that they like Farrell so much and even in spite of the Marlon crap and all those free tickets

[03:06:28.660 --> 03:06:30.220]
That's quite an endorse me, you know it

[03:06:31.000 --> 03:06:36.000]
Because you know as well as I do that most of our audience finds the Marlon stuff as terminal is as listening to paint dry

[03:06:36.000 --> 03:06:39.080]
And he's still out of 812 votes. He's still only got four

[03:06:40.280 --> 03:06:43.700]
So I think he might be more popular than god damn the six million dollar man

[03:06:44.240 --> 03:06:47.980]
And all those sandwiches. Hey, let me tell you right now if you want to get a great night sleep

[03:06:47.980 --> 03:06:50.060]
You can go to a beddinger department store and get ripped off

[03:06:50.060 --> 03:06:51.200]
You can buy a bunch of crap

[03:06:51.200 --> 03:06:55.520]
You can go through a big saw into dance you can lay down on the thing for about 10 seconds and see if you like it

[03:06:55.520 --> 03:06:59.300]
That's not the smart way to buy a mattress the smart way to do it is like all of us a Q.way

[03:06:59.300 --> 03:07:03.480]
And do that is make one easy call to the experts the bedding experts at the auto mattress

[03:07:03.480 --> 03:07:08.220]
1 800 mattress you won't believe how easy it is to pick out a perfect bed for you and your back

[03:07:08.220 --> 03:07:11.480]
Because if you're not getting a good night's sleep all day long you feel like crap

[03:07:11.480 --> 03:07:15.640]
If you go into a show room they try to steer you toward a house brand or discontinued said something

[03:07:15.640 --> 03:07:18.940]
They're trying to get rid of never happens at the auto mattress. They don't sell any crap

[03:07:18.940 --> 03:07:22.260]
They don't even have it in stock all they want to do is study the top quality in the world

[03:07:22.260 --> 03:07:28.240]
Sealy sort of Simmons temper pede no sales gimmicks no false promises and they got the high-end beds too for your high rovers

[03:07:28.240 --> 03:07:34.080]
They got Sealy's crown jewel line and the top models from every brand in the world all at every day on beatable low prices

[03:07:34.080 --> 03:07:37.940]
So just make the one easy call and you'll see what a spectacular deal it is all the way around

[03:07:37.940 --> 03:07:43.360]
Because the dollar mattress they've got that comfort exchange policy if you're not completely satisfied if you don't love that

[03:07:43.360 --> 03:07:43.680]
mattress

[03:07:43.680 --> 03:07:49.000]
They look change it for you with no questions as and they take away the crappy old bedding and set up the new one for free

[03:07:49.000 --> 03:07:52.540]
You get to choose to date and time for liberty that fits your schedule when you're going to be home

[03:07:52.540 --> 03:07:57.040]
And it's convenient for you any to our window nobody else in the universe does all of these things for you

[03:07:57.040 --> 03:08:02.120]
So if you want to get you a great new mattress and a super night sleep for years to come make the one simple call

[03:08:02.120 --> 03:08:05.440]
Like the rest of us have been doing out for a long time call one 800 mattress

[03:08:05.440 --> 03:08:11.000]
1 800 MATTR ES for dollar mattress or check them out on the way of that mattress dot com

[03:08:11.000 --> 03:08:15.180]
My life and look all this is sports radio by city

[03:08:16.000 --> 03:08:17.020]
Way to a

[03:08:19.000 --> 03:08:21.320]
Diddy trucker diddy cock it

[03:08:24.520 --> 03:08:30.340]
Is it used to have no wings?

[03:08:31.740 --> 03:08:37.480]
Any girl to what is just the thing that he is gay

[03:08:39.400 --> 03:08:44.840]
He likes you where a stretch that he looks like a light phone head

[03:08:49.640 --> 03:08:50.540]
and

[03:08:50.540 --> 03:08:55.380]
your

[03:08:55.380 --> 03:09:08.300]
Right

[03:09:19.260 --> 03:09:25.080]
We don't get to be close when it is the meeting time

[03:09:26.420 --> 03:09:32.280]
On your side, we don't know the old look back

[03:09:34.640 --> 03:09:38.820]
156-560W, he makes my skin crawl, Leo de Campery, how are we going to word that tomorrow?

[03:09:38.940 --> 03:09:41.560]
That's kind of a tough one. I was just thinking how we're going to word it, you know?

[03:09:41.860 --> 03:09:42.960]
Right, well we got all night.

[03:09:44.380 --> 03:09:47.320]
What do you mean, what's this week, Kimo-Sabi? What's that week, crap?

[03:09:47.320 --> 03:09:49.400]
You're not the one that words the pull, you do bad pull.

[03:09:49.700 --> 03:09:50.540]
I got a turt in my pocket.

[03:09:54.100 --> 03:09:54.460]
Great!

[03:09:57.920 --> 03:10:00.160]
Oh, your one's been shaking hands with Moa, huh?

[03:10:00.380 --> 03:10:01.960]
Maybe you guys can kiss and make up.

[03:10:03.460 --> 03:10:09.900]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, I was just thinking about for real describing how he had, you know,

[03:10:09.980 --> 03:10:12.720]
walks around with his hand in the back of his pants, digging for gold.

[03:10:14.580 --> 03:10:16.360]
And then, you know, shakes people's hand.

[03:10:16.460 --> 03:10:19.480]
I wouldn't be shaking Moa Howard, David, his hand, eight times sooner if I were you, unless you're going to,

[03:10:19.680 --> 03:10:22.000]
unless you carry some of that disinfectant around with him.

[03:10:22.140 --> 03:10:22.580]
I always do.

[03:10:23.020 --> 03:10:23.240]
Do you?

[03:10:23.540 --> 03:10:28.180]
See, back when the sourcing was getting everybody a little panicky up here, all these people walking around with these little tiny,

[03:10:28.720 --> 03:10:29.800]
what do they call that stuff?

[03:10:29.980 --> 03:10:31.040]
The waterless hand wash.

[03:10:31.540 --> 03:10:31.860]
Exactly!

[03:10:32.740 --> 03:10:36.540]
And they were scrubbing and rubbing and then doing a good WDQIM.

[03:10:37.320 --> 03:10:37.560]
Neil.

[03:10:37.960 --> 03:10:38.300]
Yes, sir.

[03:10:38.620 --> 03:10:40.260]
Why are you such a miserable individual?

[03:10:41.160 --> 03:10:43.000]
Meaning, this is the retired guy.

[03:10:43.440 --> 03:10:45.180]
Oh, this is the retired guy to win the race.

[03:10:45.420 --> 03:10:46.140]
You're so angry.

[03:10:46.420 --> 03:10:47.680]
Yeah, you're so, so full of crap.

[03:10:48.140 --> 03:10:48.560]
Drop dead.

[03:10:49.120 --> 03:10:49.520]
WDQIM.

[03:10:50.200 --> 03:10:51.940]
Hey, it's a lady in my room.

[03:10:51.940 --> 03:10:52.980]
All right, let's hear it.

[03:10:53.000 --> 03:10:53.460]
All right.

[03:10:53.960 --> 03:10:57.640]
I'm actually one of the contestants for next month.

[03:10:58.140 --> 03:11:00.180]
This month, actually, couple of contest.

[03:11:00.620 --> 03:11:01.240]
Is this any more?

[03:11:02.920 --> 03:11:06.280]
And I wanted to call and tell you about the movie 28 Days.

[03:11:06.300 --> 03:11:09.260]
I didn't hear the beginning of the show and I don't know if anybody brought it up,

[03:11:09.260 --> 03:11:10.540]
but it's a really great movie.

[03:11:10.840 --> 03:11:11.560]
It's a great movie.

[03:11:11.720 --> 03:11:15.460]
One guy said it was so bad he got up and walked out just a half hour into it.

[03:11:15.500 --> 03:11:15.920]
He was old.

[03:11:16.560 --> 03:11:17.760]
He was not old.

[03:11:17.800 --> 03:11:18.580]
It was a great movie guy.

[03:11:19.580 --> 03:11:19.700]
No, no, no, no, no.

[03:11:19.700 --> 03:11:19.920]
Oh, okay.

[03:11:19.940 --> 03:11:24.740]
Well, I thought it was great and my boyfriend thought it was great and I don't know if you've seen

[03:11:24.740 --> 03:11:27.740]
Shalow grave, which is also by Danny Boyle.

[03:11:27.940 --> 03:11:29.560]
It's kind of like that.

[03:11:29.700 --> 03:11:30.120]
It's similar.

[03:11:30.420 --> 03:11:31.100]
It's very good though.

[03:11:31.540 --> 03:11:33.460]
But it's not like, I can't see it.

[03:11:33.600 --> 03:11:34.860]
It's not like train spotting.

[03:11:34.960 --> 03:11:35.400]
No, I didn't know.

[03:11:35.420 --> 03:11:35.820]
No, no.

[03:11:36.120 --> 03:11:39.200]
I thought train spotting once thought it was interesting.

[03:11:39.200 --> 03:11:42.240]
But too much and it wasn't like that.

[03:11:42.480 --> 03:11:44.800]
In other words, there are no hands in the toilet bowl in this one.

[03:11:44.980 --> 03:11:45.760]
No, no, no.

[03:11:45.780 --> 03:11:47.880]
And it's not your typical zombie movie.

[03:11:48.040 --> 03:11:48.820]
They're not zombies.

[03:11:49.620 --> 03:11:50.040]
Pretty good.

[03:11:50.460 --> 03:11:51.020]
Okay, thanks.

[03:11:51.420 --> 03:11:52.360]
We got Ron Boulevardry.

[03:11:52.520 --> 03:11:53.540]
The scan came out great.

[03:11:54.200 --> 03:11:54.840]
Oh, great.

[03:11:55.040 --> 03:11:55.260]
Thanks.

[03:11:55.480 --> 03:11:56.200]
Thanks for the pictures.

[03:11:56.360 --> 03:11:56.920]
Roll it right back.

[03:11:57.340 --> 03:11:57.740]
Okay.

[03:11:57.920 --> 03:11:58.420]
See you.

[03:11:58.680 --> 03:11:58.820]
Bye.

[03:11:59.360 --> 03:12:00.100]
Yeah, there's another.

[03:12:00.100 --> 03:12:00.960]
Don't forget, get those.

[03:12:01.160 --> 03:12:01.680]
What is it?

[03:12:01.820 --> 03:12:03.300]
Contest at neo-riders.com.

[03:12:03.460 --> 03:12:03.600]
Yes.

[03:12:04.060 --> 03:12:04.600]
For the pictures.

[03:12:04.960 --> 03:12:07.560]
And this is our fourth and final one of these hot couple contest,

[03:12:07.720 --> 03:12:08.420]
at least for right now.

[03:12:09.100 --> 03:12:11.380]
And you could win a trip to the Bahamas for two or two,

[03:12:11.900 --> 03:12:15.100]
Jamaica for two months, the Heetnism 2 or 3 or 4 or 5.

[03:12:16.420 --> 03:12:17.820]
And we got a long way to go though.

[03:12:17.900 --> 03:12:21.240]
I like the fact we're starting this early because it gives you two weeks to get the pictures in.

[03:12:21.380 --> 03:12:23.960]
And then Monday, June 14th, we'll put the pictures on our website.

[03:12:24.280 --> 03:12:25.480]
And they'll have a full week to vote on them.

[03:12:25.580 --> 03:12:27.980]
And Monday, June 21st, we'll pick the winner.

[03:12:29.780 --> 03:12:31.600]
Maybe more likes to do that too, pick the winner.

[03:12:31.600 --> 03:12:35.600]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60, WDQAM.

[03:12:36.400 --> 03:12:36.980]
Nobody there.

[03:12:37.120 --> 03:12:37.480]
What a shame.

[03:12:37.820 --> 03:12:39.300]
That was probably going to be our best call today.

[03:12:39.880 --> 03:12:40.320]
WDQAM.

[03:12:40.420 --> 03:12:40.920]
Can I say it?

[03:12:43.960 --> 03:12:44.400]
WDQAM.

[03:12:44.720 --> 03:12:45.320]
Nobody there.

[03:12:45.600 --> 03:12:46.040]
WDQAM.

[03:12:46.860 --> 03:12:47.300]
Yeah.

[03:12:47.540 --> 03:12:48.200]
A meal please.

[03:12:48.640 --> 03:12:49.220]
Yes sir, speaking.

[03:12:50.240 --> 03:12:50.680]
Nail.

[03:12:51.060 --> 03:12:51.680]
Speaking, yes.

[03:12:52.080 --> 03:12:53.300]
Come here for the cold springs.

[03:12:55.980 --> 03:12:56.860]
Sandra Bowick.

[03:12:57.280 --> 03:12:58.720]
She makes my skin crawl.

[03:12:59.000 --> 03:12:59.560]
Are you serious?

[03:13:00.160 --> 03:13:01.180]
Yes, I am.

[03:13:01.180 --> 03:13:02.740]
Is she too, is she too clumsy?

[03:13:03.600 --> 03:13:04.400]
No talent.

[03:13:06.580 --> 03:13:09.920]
And I think that, you know, that she's the primates NEP one.

[03:13:10.000 --> 03:13:12.500]
There's an early movie she did speed or something like that.

[03:13:12.640 --> 03:13:12.780]
Yeah.

[03:13:12.900 --> 03:13:14.180]
We're out to run away bus and all.

[03:13:14.960 --> 03:13:19.580]
And she ended up, uh, I, after that I was convinced she could not act.

[03:13:19.740 --> 03:13:22.020]
She might be a little bit better, but I think, you know,

[03:13:22.120 --> 03:13:24.320]
it's the one of those typical things where Holly would, uh,

[03:13:25.080 --> 03:13:27.500]
get, put someone in whoever they want to put in.

[03:13:27.560 --> 03:13:29.120]
And they could just promote the hell out of them.

[03:13:29.120 --> 03:13:30.940]
Okay, I think she's cute, but have a great day.

[03:13:31.320 --> 03:13:33.940]
You know, I think that the, uh, Faggot guy, that was the same guy again.

[03:13:34.680 --> 03:13:35.040]
Really?

[03:13:35.400 --> 03:13:36.000]
You know what I'm talking about?

[03:13:36.460 --> 03:13:37.380]
The chronic Schwarzer guy.

[03:13:37.520 --> 03:13:38.800]
And anyway, my dog's coming up now.

[03:13:38.820 --> 03:13:39.600]
Bye, bye, bye.

[03:13:40.160 --> 03:13:43.200]
When the electric show, I'm fighting the NQAM,

[03:13:43.360 --> 03:13:44.280]
planning for learning.

[03:13:44.560 --> 03:13:46.040]
Big gigantic dark ass.
