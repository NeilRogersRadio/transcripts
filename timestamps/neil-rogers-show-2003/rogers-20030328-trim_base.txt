[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.620]
Friday you first is

[00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.040]
Good I rack you up there

[00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.080]
Yeah, I saw them on radio back then

[00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.940]
We didn't take their cry

[00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.960]
No in Pearl Harbor or when the Japs drop their bombs

[00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.300]
We bombed them back and now this audience

[00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:28.360]
They hit us hard and our cards are little flags way

[00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.220]
As that sunny

[00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.700]
Loving retired voice of others the wrong way

[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:36.400]
Or

[00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.240]
They

[00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.020]
did by push endless

[00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.640]
This family, we they got this country up

[00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.320]
And the link to the darkest days and I used to read

[00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:05.060]
I don't want to be a packs of mariners

[00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:07.480]
In the goddamn USA

[00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:09.600]
Oh!

[00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.180]
What's a few thousand innocent lives

[00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.640]
Stop living in the past

[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.240]
If you want that SUV to drive

[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.800]
You're gonna need more gas

[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.480]
It's the greatest country in the world

[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.380]
They train us to believe

[00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.520]
And anyone who says that obviously

[00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.660]
And so forth to the

[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.480]
You turn a thousand barrels to be in America

[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.380]
Because where we take triadly leaves

[00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:51.980]
Where the flag is with us

[00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:53.660]
With our hand in the sand

[00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.460]
It blindly follows the powers that pee

[00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.560]
Appacetic

[00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.640]
Up washing state from news

[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.400]
On a 6.5 inch screen

[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.700]
Raccoons, ratchet balls, and fire

[00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.540]
Everything's okay

[00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:11.660]
In the goddamn USA

[00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.160]
Oh, black America

[00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.160]
Alright, it's 903 at 560 WQ

[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.440]
I got bad news from all by the way I'm not croaking yet

[00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.000]
I have my doubts there for a couple of days

[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.460]
I had some, you know, a couple of off days

[00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.380]
And I have a feeling that he was crossing his fingers and his legs

[00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.460]
Even had a couple of them hair pieces crossed

[00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:31.700]
Yeah, too late

[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.440]
If I'm gonna cross my fingers and legs

[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.680]
I'd be hoping the next trend isn't like this last one mole

[00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:37.400]
That's what I'd be hoping

[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.240]
Boy, you know, coming back into this building

[00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.480]
There is one good thing to be said for it

[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.680]
That is encountering some of the people

[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.040]
I mean, just to go to take a leak

[00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.840]
And I counter some people I haven't seen in a while

[00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.420]
It just makes me realize the incredible hatred

[00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.820]
That there isn't this building for the mole-meister

[00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.180]
I mean, just venom

[00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.980]
I mean, incredible

[00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.940]
Nobody's perfect, but in his case I think we may be

[00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.880]
I think he's got a hundred percent batting average now

[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.680]
It's always been a soap opera at every radio station

[00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.860]
Not like this

[00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.660]
Not like this, man

[00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.140]
This is just amazing

[00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:07.900]
A astonishing shocking

[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:09.160]
Yeah

[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.820]
Anyway, I found a picture of Marlon Brando that we were looking for desperately

[00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.260]
I was looking for it's in this week's National Inquire

[00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:16.780]
We're dated March, April 1

[00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.520]
And it's no April Fool, in fact

[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.720]
Oh, it's on page 6

[00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.780]
Marlon Brando suffering heart failure

[00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.380]
And here's a picture of poor Marlon

[00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.440]
That looks like somebody offered him a series of bankwoods he couldn't refuse

[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.520]
I mean, good, golly Miss Molly

[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:33.480]
Very sad, you know

[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.180]
But he's always been kind of like F-Duff

[00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:38.080]
I think he's a good author

[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.160]
Yeah, everywhere he's just a great actor

[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.460]
We love the Godfather

[00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:44.240]
Yeah

[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.220]
But you know what happened to the Godfather

[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.000]
Our poll yesterday and anybody who saw the poll encountered late wonders

[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.360]
How come you left off Fox News

[00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.680]
Well, we didn't leave off Fox News, we had them all on there

[00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.680]
But the problem being again when you deal with those right wingers out there

[00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.140]
They want to dittle with your poll

[00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.640]
You know

[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.480]
Here they're always blaming all the illiberal pinkos for dittling with each other's polls

[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.340]
But they want to dittle with our poll, you know

[00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:07.820]
And we're getting tired of them, did it

[00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:10.560]
So once they started to zoom in the Fox up there from the middle of the pack

[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.360]
Which is where it was

[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.680]
I said, hey, we're being freaked man

[00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.000]
Let's creep the creeps

[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.580]
Get them out of there so we had a yank frog's off the other thing

[00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:19.340]
Which is just as well

[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.020]
Because we're talking about news

[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:22.860]
We're not talking about propaganda

[00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.900]
We're not talking about spin all spin all day

[00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:27.100]
Cheerleading

[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.080]
1183 votes on a poll and spite of the fact we touch locks off of there

[00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.920]
Which of these do you think is doing the best, uh, given the best war coverage

[00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.780]
MSNBC

[00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.660]
And we're sold

[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.660]
256, 21 and a half percent MSNBC winning

[00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.060]
Don't know I'm not watching any of it

[00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:43.900]
204

[00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:45.380]
CNN 175

[00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.960]
I guess those are the people I like their news about two three hours later

[00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:51.360]
The internet 172

[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.200]
BBC 149

[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.120]
That is shocking

[00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.520]
NBC, the only one of the commercial networks to get even a tickle in this

[00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.960]
58 NPR National Public Radio also 58

[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.680]
CBC 56 and two badmost people here can't get it like on a regular basis

[00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:10.020]
Although now you can get it on our website we got a link on there at the where's it right under the, uh, the thing

[00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:11.000]
Raeid's uh thing

[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.160]
How about that Raeid

[00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:14.940]
Yeah, I don't know you won't hear from him no more

[00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:19.300]
But we discovered that just in time just to get his last communication from a bag that

[00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:20.580]
No more Raeid

[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.680]
So either his internet is down or

[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.140]
Oh, he had it coming anyway

[00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.840]
Or worse

[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.920]
CBC 56 votes, ABC 31

[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:28.960]
And again, CBS

[00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:34.060]
That gigantic series of tear drops from the CBS eyes because there's second win 25 votes

[00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:35.120]
They're almost as low as Mo

[00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:37.180]
As low as you can go

[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:41.600]
We're figuring here about a two five and men in this last trend in the monthly in the February

[00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:44.260]
So he goes from the mountaintop right to the

[00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:45.040]
Crapper

[00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.620]
And since most of the months, uh, yeah

[00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:49.220]
See you can't tell month to month

[00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:53.620]
But over a period of time is what gives you a pretty good idea of who's really listening out there

[00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.360]
Over a period of months and years and all of these things

[00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:00.480]
And so when you like average it out when you realize that month after month after month

[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:03.840]
And there was that bogus January which was pretty much the anti-neil vote, you know

[00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:07.480]
So they're all onium. Oh, it's really a sad situation

[00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:11.040]
Although Zach, I know Zach lost 28 pounds

[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.660]
He's looking pretty, you know, for him

[00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:16.580]
Well, he's crappin his brains out every day because he never knows when the axe is going to fall

[00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:18.400]
Or is that what is he's crappin his brains out

[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:19.960]
Letta lose his voice really fast

[00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:20.720]
Yeah, upset stuff

[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:24.100]
So George tells me the lifestyle's convention yesterday was sensational

[00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:27.360]
Or even before we get into that, even more sensational news

[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:30.520]
Because I thought you screwed up yesterday which would not be the first time

[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:34.120]
But I thought you screwed up and uh, tell me that we're out of here 1150 today

[00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:38.520]
And I look at the, see somebody here screwed up, I want to say it was clearance again

[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.860]
Or month or whatever make, I guess clearance makes the schedules right?

[00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:42.260]
You're asking me

[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:44.180]
Carles out again

[00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:46.540]
Well, I've been wanting to have the apartment down there

[00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:50.700]
Yeah, well, well, I guess he's a little bit out of sorts, you know, after he got the

[00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:52.900]
From Dixie

[00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:54.280]
Normus

[00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:54.840]
Carles did?

[00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:56.800]
No, clearance

[00:06:58.640 --> 00:06:59.680]
Carles wasn't that lucky

[00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:02.020]
Clarence, although he could have been one day

[00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:04.800]
I'll tell you one thing, I've never seen him this happy all the time I've been working here

[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:08.760]
Walking around with a big smile ear to ear on his uh, push, not Carles, Clarence

[00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:13.640]
Well, maybe it was something involving the two of them, maybe Eridixie was in the middle, I don't know

[00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:17.300]
With a gigantic strap on, I don't know what the deal is

[00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:21.400]
But at any rate, so he screwed up the whole schedule here, so it said 1250 to Barla game

[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:25.360]
And I'm thinking, boy George, you know, give me this great hope that we have a really short show today

[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:27.100]
And come to find out that he was right

[00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:29.540]
Oh, yeah! We're on Hurley to 1150

[00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:33.380]
So now that we finally got some momentum, we got those five billboards up all around town

[00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:37.300]
We got a big number in February, and now they're screwing us with Marlon's exhibition baseball

[00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:40.360]
Oh, they're not screwing us, they're screwing the audience

[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:44.320]
But they're screwing us in the long run because it's going to chase a lot of people away

[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:46.200]
Although, I'm sure we have at least, huh?

[00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:46.860]
What's it day?

[00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:50.160]
I'll guarantee you there are a lot of people going to be tuned to that Marlon game

[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:51.120]
Fuck third man!

[00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:53.100]
Yeah, yeah

[00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:57.160]
Guaranteed, Guaranteed, man, they're going to be just lining up here and ex-

[00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:00.580]
The good news is, I believe it's the last night's exhibition game, am I right?

[00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:05.100]
Because the scene starts on Monday, I don't see any more exhibitionist games on the schedule over the weekend

[00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:10.420]
We got a couple of more Panther crap, Panther droppings, lost again in St. Louis last night

[00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:13.840]
Two seconds left in the game, it's in the net, I'll be damned

[00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:17.780]
I'll be stinking damn, and they lose two to one in St. Louis

[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:23.760]
As the street continues, as they continue to, I'll tell you one thing, they're consistent, all of those consistent as Mo

[00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:27.620]
They score either one or two goals every game, basically

[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.920]
Huh? Can't be more consistent than that, they don't want to overdo it, I guess

[00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:33.140]
So it's been a depressing season at the Macarena

[00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:38.300]
Question is, who's going to have the most seasoned ticket holders for next year? Is it going to be Marlon's or the Panthers?

[00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:39.000]
Huh?

[00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:42.400]
You know how many seasoned ticket holders the Marlon's are going to have this year?

[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:43.420]
About 30 men!

[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:47.060]
Anyway, we got a good poll today, we got a lot of stuff right out of here early at 11.50

[00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:51.500]
Oh god, my health is coming back, thanks to my good doctor friend, everything is looking roses

[00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:55.060]
Of course I come back to town, the very first day we got tornado warnings all over the place

[00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:59.140]
It's raining like the end of the world, although it beats the Asara's warning in Toronto

[00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:00.180]
Did you see that on the news?

[00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:05.360]
Major panic in the city, and all around the world

[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:09.100]
Because what does that stand for, severe acute respiratory syndrome, something like that?

[00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:15.120]
Yeah, yeah, and they don't really have a cure for it, although I will say this, that most of the people who are coming down with it are not dying

[00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:20.800]
Well, that's good, they're isolating them and they're chatting with whatever, I don't know, but antiviral something

[00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:27.180]
There have only been a few people in North America that died from it, but nevertheless, and then I'm really sure how it spread

[00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:30.920]
They're saying it might be airborne, which would really be a bad piece of news, but I don't think so

[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:33.460]
Because it was airborne, it would be like millions of people that already

[00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:37.720]
They think that what they think it is just like droplets from coughing or sneezing

[00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:41.620]
And, well, I just came back from Toronto, so I want to spread it around

[00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:46.600]
In fact, I went in, just in case that's the way it works, I went in open to door to most studio and he was in the middle of it

[00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:48.700]
Yeah, segment, what the heck?

[00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:49.260]
What the heck?

[00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:54.780]
Just to share a good crap with Mo, although he probably has some good crap himself after seeing that number

[00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:57.100]
You know, they got all excited when I was January and all

[00:09:57.100 --> 00:10:00.340]
And then right, I think that's maybe the lowest number he's had all along

[00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:03.980]
It's probably I figure about a two-five, about a two-three, maybe a one, huh?

[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:06.340]
Pretty lame in there, looks like to me

[00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:08.920]
We're gonna boycott the deal, Roger!

[00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:12.360]
See, that's not gonna work, Mo, it's just ain't the way, you know, do a good show

[00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:16.320]
Become a human being, which I realize is highly unlikely when you get to be in your mid-70s

[00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:18.440]
It's probably unlikely, but, you know, give it a shot

[00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:23.400]
Because just being the anti-neil or the anti-everybody else on a radio station, that ain't gonna cut it

[00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:26.340]
I'm coming back from the doctor yesterday, I turned on the Humper

[00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:30.580]
And he was taking a couple of really good jabs at the Mo Meister

[00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:31.900]
Yeah, uh-huh

[00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:33.940]
See, I got a couple of them now

[00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:36.860]
Some guy called it and said he was at the beast the thing the other night

[00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:37.400]
Yeah

[00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:40.840]
And everybody was friendly and was having a great time and Hank says that's because Mo wasn't there

[00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:43.920]
We need a report on that

[00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:44.740]
On what?

[00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:46.900]
The beauty for the beast thing

[00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:50.920]
Well, the good news for the audiences that it's Friday, which means it's

[00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:52.580]
Beast Way in Day

[00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:53.560]
That Friday

[00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:56.900]
That Friday at QA M he'll be in here, bouncing up and down on the scale

[00:10:56.900 --> 00:11:00.200]
He better get with it because that may pass him like he's standing still, you know

[00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:02.000]
So he can give us the report first hand

[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:02.780]
That is correct

[00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:03.820]
Well, we got a short show

[00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:07.940]
11 past nine at five sixty WQAM

[00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:09.160]
We're at three-oh man

[00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:12.200]
It would be like if we started and said oh by the way, you're only until nine thirty

[00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:13.320]
We got a bunch of crap on there

[00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:15.420]
Oh no, not only the line thirty man

[00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:16.220]
Ah, nine one

[00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:17.180]
About thirty man

[00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:20.020]
You know, for years I've been telling you about the health benefits of olio, man

[00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:22.800]
I keep telling you because it's great stuff, it really does stuff for you

[00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:25.960]
Olio, man, soft gels contain pharmaceutical-grade olivore

[00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:31.420]
Not just ordinary pedestrian crappy olivore, but the best, super concentrated and loaded with health benefits

[00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:34.480]
Olio, man, NBA can help reduce the risk of heart disease and high cholesterol

[00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:38.280]
Plus, there are fourteen different olio, man, formulas for you to choose from

[00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:42.720]
Each one combines pharmaceutical-grade olivore with vitamins, minerals, herbals to support specific needs

[00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:45.260]
From your bones, your blood pressure to your immune system

[00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.700]
Just to cut the formulas that are right for you and what you'll be needing

[00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:49.920]
And right now we got three new olio, man, formulas

[00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:52.000]
One to help you sleep, one to help you control your weight

[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:55.460]
And cell Q10, which is damn important for your heart

[00:11:55.460 --> 00:12:00.080]
You'll find olio-meda publics, records, wall greens, whole food markets, navaros, and sedanos

[00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:03.140]
Or order it online if you prefer at olio-meda-merica.com

[00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:06.140]

Call them toll free and ask away, call 1-866-olio-med

[00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:12.620]

[00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:17.780]
I am!

[00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:22.900]
And local, this is 43560-1-2-A-M

[00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:26.180]
Getin' poundin'.

[00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:32.280]
If you watch only one reality show this season, you'll wanna watch the show where the kids finally get into the action

[00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:37.500]
Tonight on Fox, the premiere of Touched by an American Idol

[00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:43.400]
Young boys from all over the country will compete for the affection and fortune of American icon Michael Jackson

[00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:44.600]
That's a beautiful thing.

[00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:46.140]
Touched by an American Idol

[00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:47.300]
What's it doing now?

[00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:49.120]
This is called growing and changing

[00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:54.700]
It's reality TV like no other, and you get to vote on who gets to sleep and Michael's bed

[00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:55.220]
Honestly!

[00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:59.120]
Touched by an American Idol Tuesday night at 10 on Fox

[00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:00.600]
Which role was shearing along?

[00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:02.140]
But I don't wanna share!

[00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:05.860]
917-560-WDKM

[00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:07.460]
We may have to speed up the show today, you know?

[00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:10.000]
Like you want the music stations, speed up the music?

[00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:11.760]
So we're gonna talk a lot faster now.

[00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:12.640]
I can't talk any faster.

[00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:14.880]
Anyway, I should've mentioned that on the Oliomet spot

[00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:19.060]
I just looked at this and the attack at the end is appropriate for right now, and I left it off.

[00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:21.620]
And I don't wanna screw up because we don't wanna get our good friends upset.

[00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:22.880]
They want something even more free-olio-men.

[00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:27.460]
If you're planning on attending the NASDAQ tennis tournaments this week, make sure you stop by the Oliomet booth.

[00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:33.840]
They're gonna be given away free samples and raffling away gift baskets packed with Oliomet products so you can have your hands on it right away in the Oliomet too.

[00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:39.960]
Anyway, here's a poll today and I'm inspired by three, a series of three letters to the editor in the hero.

[00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:42.880]
See, I see which letters they pick out to put in certain newspapers.

[00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:49.500]
Not that they would use the editorial pages, not just their own editorial opinions, but the letters to try to make a point, but they do.

[00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:51.860]
Protests protested.

[00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:57.880]
So in other words, those people who read the hero, which includes me, read both papers, my forest, my necessity.

[00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:01.740]
There are no more protesters who read the Mime Hero.

[00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:05.780]
Because all three letters basically say the same thing which I'm gonna read them.

[00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:07.820]
And boy, it's pretty scary.

[00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:11.220]
Wait till you're the first one from Alan Savitz and Carl Gables.

[00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:14.740]
The piece-knicks are unwittingly helping our enemies.

[00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:18.020]
They will prolong the conflict and put our soldiers at risk.

[00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:23.400]
Most of these idealists don't realize the important part that psychological warfare and propaganda plan every war.

[00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:27.480]
The marches in New York, Washington and other cities have a demoralizing effect on our troops.

[00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:32.920]
Once our president, Congress, and more than 60% of the people have approved and committed our soldiers to a war,

[00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:37.140]
it is duty and obligation of every American to support our troops on the field of battle.

[00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:38.560]
Do we support our troops, yes?

[00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:39.060]
Absolutely.

[00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:42.420]
Then it says there should be laws enacted to this effect.

[00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:43.160]
Oh yeah.

[00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:44.000]
Wait.

[00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:46.520]
I'm not making this up.

[00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:52.920]
If we allow freedom of expression during a war, it will result in the death of many good Americans in our allies.

[00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:58.800]
Under these circumstances of war, it's an act of treason and a lack of loyalty, allegiance and trust to openly display,

[00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:01.500]
and opposition to what we already have engaged in.

[00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:05.340]
I guess this figure must be not old enough to remember Vietnam.

[00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:10.820]
Too bad we didn't have a lot more war protesters like in the mid-60s.

[00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:11.780]
I'm stunned.

[00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:18.400]
If we allow freedom of expression during a war, so this guy must love the Patriot Act 1 and Patriot Act 2 and 3 and 4 and 5,

[00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:19.860]
and all the other sequels that are going to come.

[00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:20.480]
The third Reich.

[00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:21.660]
Right, there you go.

[00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:24.240]
Alan the Gables, man, you need some help, Alan.

[00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:32.240]
Mark Goodman and Kiba Scanzas, the shame of the protest nationally and internationally, is that they reflect a hatred for our president more than they concerned about humanity.

[00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:39.520]
Apparently nothing could be more evil than the president's bravado, his absent linguistic skills and a friendly ruling by the Supreme Court.

[00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:40.600]
How about his, oh sorry.

[00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:43.340]
What sacrifice have these people made for the Iraqi people?

[00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:52.320]
No banners be moaning Saddam to stop the torture, no calls to stop the massacre of the Kurds and Shiites, no demands to get rid of weapons of mass destruction, no doubt over the years,

[00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:56.320]
these heroes have suffered great anguish over the plight of the Iraqi people since Mark and Kiba Scanzas.

[00:15:57.300 --> 00:16:07.680]
It seems to me that the Iraqi people have suffered tremendously the last 12 years because of UN sanctions and now they're suffering unbelievably bad because all these gigantic bombs are dropping and innocent men, women and children on both sides are dying.

[00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:13.660]
And also a lot of that friendly fire I don't think is being fired by war protesters over here is being fired by a careless people over there.

[00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:14.940]
Well you know crap happens.

[00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:17.260]
Let me just say this to be part of the last of these three letters.

[00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:25.420]
There isn't one person who has been died, who has died, been maimed or wounded in Iraq and last a week plus now.

[00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:31.280]
Who would be dead right now if it wouldn't have been for this invasion, this illegal war, not one.

[00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:31.960]
Right.

[00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:38.900]
So talk about suffering, talk about the grotesque images, not just of the American POWs but of the children and I mean it's unbelievable.

[00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:49.160]
And now they're saying you know in Baghdad the phones are going out the TV, they knocked the TV channel off the air, the lights are finally going out and they're saying this war is going to go on for months.

[00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:57.100]
So you can just imagine the goodwill that's really building up in the city of Baghdad, a city of five million people by the way, same as the city of Chicago, same side.

[00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:58.680]
Heroes. We're going to be held as heroes.

[00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:00.200]
Yeah.

[00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:03.180]
And I hope the flower shops are still living by the way.

[00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:08.060]
And then latent bank in Miami writes the third of this trifective letters in the herald this morning.

[00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:11.660]
The appropriate time to protest wars when the political decisions being made.

[00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:17.660]
Once our troops are in the field that is insensitive and even cruel to these men, women and their families to degrade their sacrifice.

[00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:21.080]
I mean, are you listening to these words?

[00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:22.860]
We're not degrading their sacrifice.

[00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:27.960]
We're lamenting the fact that they were sent there in a first place and that a lot of them are going to come home and boxes and body bags.

[00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:30.740]
That's what we're lamenting, not their sacrifice or fitting children.

[00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:37.900]
Volunteers in our armed forces don't take the clear war and they simply swore to protect and defend our constitution, which puts that decision in the hands of others.

[00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:43.640]
The right to protest, so freely exercised, is guaranteed by the same constitution that our uniform military upholds.

[00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:48.120]
War protesters owe our servicemen and women gratitude not scorned.

[00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:52.660]
I haven't seen anybody. See this, this is the, you know what this reminds me of? It's like Iraq and 9-11.

[00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:54.580]
Right. There's no linkage. No, what's it?

[00:17:54.580 --> 00:18:04.960]
When also speak of that, the latest thing that they've tried to say is that this onsar al-Islam group, who's fighting the Kurds by Iran by the border, they're connected to al-Qaeda.

[00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:11.960]
There was a lengthy piece on MSNBC this morning they pointed out that there are another bunch of fundamentalist Muslims who have nothing to do with al-Qaeda.

[00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:15.700]
Oh, sure. They have a post-aligned to Iran and Iraq. So I just mentioned that in passing, okay?

[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:21.700]
But don't confuse this with the facts. Just put out this big blur of stuff and then kind of let it all like sift together, you know?

[00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:24.920]
A heady stew. Yeah, just tied all in together. Cool.

[00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:30.840]
So somehow this concept that there's anybody out there protesting against the troops, I haven't seen it.

[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.280]
No. Any more than I've seen anybody saying, hey, we love Sodom. I keep hearing that.

[00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:41.620]
Or you're a polygist for Sodom who's saying, no, we're not. We understand he's a butcher. So now we're going to match the butcher a bag that with the butcher of Washington.

[00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:47.780]
That's what we've done. And there are a lot of innocent men, women and children on all sides over there who are being slaughtered.

[00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:53.420]
And for them to tell us now this is going to go on for months, let me say it again. I see so much of Vietnam all over again.

[00:18:53.900 --> 00:19:01.780]
And how dare you people protest and how I mean this line again, if we allow freedom of expression during a war, it'll result in the deaths of many good Americans and our allies.

[00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:09.460]
So I guess what you said we have to bring in just eliminate, suspend all civil liberties at this point.

[00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:13.440]
Everybody dump me up and we'll just play God bless America all day, every day.

[00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:21.520]
And we can't have an election next year because I told you in the middle of the world that there's some people who believe that, you know, who feel that way.

[00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:27.440]
Let's just any further elections until everything is done until that we make the future.

[00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:31.840]
We got that hose tied in about so many way those letters inspired me to this to pull today.

[00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:38.460]
What's your take on the war protesters and we've got seven, let's see, 367 excellent choices for you.

[00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:49.220]
I'm one of them. I support them 100%. They're exercising their rights. They're unpatriotic. They're bad for troop morale. They're a bunch of commy pinko assholes or I protest mohauer davidit.

[00:19:49.660 --> 00:20:03.660]
Those are the seven choices on our pool today. What's your take on the war protesters? I'm one of them. I support them 100%. They're exercising their rights. They're unpatriotic. They're bad for troop morale. They're a bunch of commy pinko assholes or I press protest mohauer davidit.

[00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:11.060]
So anyway, all the good news is we got two pieces of good news. We got the new computer. Thanks to me for coming out in my spare check.

[00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:17.640]
Got a nice computer that's as fast as lightning. So George wants to apologize to Bell Sof for all the grief he's been given out. No, they still suck.

[00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:23.820]
Now don't be saying that we got to find the fine connection here. We got 1200 votes on yesterday's a blow by the computer of this building.

[00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:33.140]
And I have a fine connection home, although it's not Bell Sof is comcast. I'm telling you, you've got old wiring in your house. All right. You got old wiring. Old and moldy.

[00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:40.080]
Yeah, you just marked my word. See, if there was something wrong with their service, how could we be getting this lightning? I mean, incredible service here.

[00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:46.520]
You follow what I'm saying just because we got the neighborhood go out and get you a new computer. That's what you need to get a computer top of the life.

[00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:55.400]
Throw that one out. Get you a top of the line. The best, the most expensive, the best of money can buy. The real good news is that like I started to say, the lifestyle is convention.

[00:20:55.400 --> 00:21:03.160]
The church reports that there were just a bunch of a bunch of wonderful people there yesterday. You could feel the love. You could feel as much of it as you wanted to.

[00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:11.000]
Now bet. And he said, no, no depressing people. None of the crap that we hear a lot every day. See, well, I don't want to even go into it because they have a car.

[00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:21.080]
No, what's the point? There are some happy people here in South Florida. The problem being that we they don't have time for us. They're busy having a good time and enjoying life and more power to them. That's right.

[00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:28.560]
They're enjoying it while they can. As opposed to see the one thing about this town is that South Florida smells of old people.

[00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:37.300]
No, seriously, you rolled out a window in your car and you try to get some fresh air. Oh, it smells like death out there. I thought it was swamp gas.

[00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:46.240]
You're walking the streets, you know, trying to get a little exercise, little fresh air. Oh, it smells like death like old people like to cheese. Yeah, like to jam.

[00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:52.660]
It smells like most peace and is bagged. Oh, and I never got around to the Cleveland Clinic yesterday to make it a deposit.

[00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:57.980]
But you mark my words one of these days when I get inspired, I've been eating about 40 pounds of sorbitol candy.

[00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:02.540]
And I'm going to go over there and like give them an editorial comment what I think of their health care.

[00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:11.940]
Anyway, better hurry right along. I will do screenless today. We get a lot of comments in about the war protesters and about the comedy pinkos.

[00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:15.960]
Let's suspend freedom of expression. I mean, I'm reading some of this stuff and it's just staggering to me.

[00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:22.600]
The idea and this is always the tactic you've got to go along. You got to go step along. Otherwise you're a comedy pinko.

[00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:28.140]
I mean, what are we fighting for? I thought that's what we're defending is the right to do all of these things.

[00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:34.440]
The right to keep this country free and the freedom of speech all the bill of rights. I thought that's what people are supposed to be fighting for.

[00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:39.020]
Even though of course in this war, it doesn't represent any threat to any of those things. That is what we're fighting for. So shut up.

[00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:46.200]
Oh, well said. What did you say? 26 past nine at five. Six people do screenless.

[00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:50.320]
Two by the way, we'll get the phone. So everybody's just going to talk almost a day off here again today like this.

[00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:57.180]
Yeah. This is the kind of week I can handle. They off here a sick day off there. The short show with a ball game.

[00:22:57.260 --> 00:23:02.880]
I like that. I think about two and a half days a week sounds good. Maybe with a ball game thrown in for one short show.

And you're welcome. 9-32-560-WQ-Mertjard Pearl. US Architect of the War on

[00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:14.200]
Lovelief and the

[00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:17.640]
agreement with you however people have a right to free speech yeah i am sick of

[00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:19.500]
this totalitarian government craft

[00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:20.640]
patriot at his

[00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:23.120]
the as i had a slow down i would have slipped

[00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:25.240]
and i didn't

[00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:27.680]
but i happen to be a person who believed that

[00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:31.740]
sedh on his threat to us and therefore i kind of support the war and i

[00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:33.160]
actually do support the war

[00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:38.880]
i also you know i also having been a huge protesters of the in our more

[00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:41.240]
completely one hundred percent

[00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:42.500]
unequivically

[00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:45.460]
demand that the people who are protesting this war be

[00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:47.160]
given all their rights to protest

[00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:49.480]
i love it i think our troops

[00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:51.460]
actually like the fact

[00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:55.980]
that they can say to themselves we are fighting for the freedom of the american

[00:27:55.980 --> 00:27:59.580]
see first of all the troops are sitting over their watch in msnbc and cnc

[00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:00.560]
and i don't know

[00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:05.240]
do they know that there's something every every conflict all troops know that

[00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:05.700]
that's a good

[00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:07.900]
it does not hurt our true folks

[00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:12.360]
our troops are proud americans i have got a son in the united states maybe

[00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:14.200]
on station in the version golfing

[00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:15.920]
and i'm telling you

[00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:20.120]
like the idea that he is fighting for what we call freedom

[00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:21.360]
right here in the

[00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:25.120]
he is proud of the fact that his country allows people to come out and speak

[00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:25.840]
their mind

[00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:30.320]
now how can you possibly say i'm fighting for freedom of speech and freedom of

[00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:32.900]
this and that if we start suppressing freedom of this

[00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:35.780]
the last three letters i read from the herald are just enough to return my

[00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:36.060]
stomach

[00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:39.880]
i mean this business about if we allow freedom of expression during a war

[00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:42.760]
so we're just supposed to declare martial war suspend all freedoms

[00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:45.540]
and everybody who step in line that sounds very familiar to me

[00:28:45.540 --> 00:28:46.000]
i'll point

[00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:47.060]
it look

[00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:48.400]
i hate

[00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:50.560]
but i don't like you that word but i hate

[00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:52.280]
George bush

[00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:53.480]
yeah i think he has a piece

[00:28:54.140 --> 00:28:55.960]
of basically walking talking

[00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:56.740]
excrement

[00:28:56.740 --> 00:28:58.940]
i get more

[00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:03.000]
him in the lowest of the steam i wouldn't use him for the dog catcher

[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000]
but that doesn't mean that i disagree

[00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:08.420]
with the concept which may or may not be right i mean i

[00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:12.780]
totally open open the suggestion but i do believe that sadaam

[00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:15.600]
has proven himself to be a ruthless

[00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:16.480]
m-affer

[00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:18.400]
yeah you mean like to bell castrow

[00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:21.680]
and like in like the chinese and like the North Koreans and like the

[00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:23.380]
Iranians and like i could listen

[00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:27.880]
me all right robert mogabi and i could listen probably twenty or thirty if we

[00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:28.280]
had the time

[00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:29.820]
castrow

[00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:31.260]
let me say this okay

[00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:35.620]
when sadaam was driven out of quay and there's a bit of courses to other

[00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:38.560]
quay should be part of a record not because of the history of the area

[00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:43.180]
but when he was driven out of quay having lost the war okay he lost the war

[00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:48.060]
when he said the oil wells of quay non-fire yeah i was just vengefulness that was

[00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:52.000]
just hatefulness right brother islamic so i can ask you something so that at

[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.780]
that point why didn't we do something then

[00:29:54.420 --> 00:29:56.880]
because the father of the president moron

[00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:58.660]
who was equally stupid yeah

[00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:01.300]
i don't have to explain that to you do i really

[00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:05.160]
so well i'd listen i don't want to waste my time here to the end of me waste but i

[00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:08.920]
want to spend a whole show to debate it more called that's fine okay thanks and good luck

[00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:12.480]
yourself good luck to your son love you buddy i don't want to debate the pros

[00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:15.300]
and cons i mean if you support the war you're in title if you don't support it if

[00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:19.440]
you're on the side of that's fine but the idea this this concept of well the troops

[00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:22.180]
are already there fighting and anybody who uh... dare speak out against this is

[00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:25.700]
unpaid throughout this is the oldest trick in a book this is the trick that these

[00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:28.900]
batches have been used since before they got into office either you're with us

[00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:32.080]
you're against us it's the good against the evil the yin and the yang that all

[00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:36.660]
this other bull crab that's such a simplistic moronic mentality but obviously

[00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:39.020]
there are a lot of morons out there and that's so those are the people who buy

[00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:43.540]

[00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:23.440]
uh... these raffles weren't you know are are just laughing at it

[00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:25.480]
at our administration this administration

[00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:30.320]
uh... spending spending spending and eventually we're going to end up

[00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:33.360]
going broke that is exactly what they wanted to do

[00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:34.880]
and you know

[00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:38.880]
this thing about you know either your way this or your gandest

[00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:40.520]
uh... they're not going to twist

[00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:41.640]
the mentality

[00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:43.460]
of the definition of war

[00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:44.740]
in my mind

[00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:49.540]
we want the aggressor they were the aggressor there's no reason for us to

[00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:51.340]
treat

[00:32:52.820 --> 00:32:53.620]
with aggression

[00:32:53.620 --> 00:32:56.400]
well you know when you when you stop and think about it since the overwhelming

[00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:58.700]
majority the countries in the world are opposed to this war

[00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:03.260]
uh... if you if you operate based on that philosophy read the read the

[00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:05.040]
with us or against this good guys are bad guys

[00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:07.920]
we're putting ourselves against the overwhelming majority the rest of the

[00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:10.380]
world which i don't think most american people are ready to do that except the

[00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:14.340]
the absolute american first the u.s.a. is shouting crowd at that bunch

[00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:15.100]

[00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:25.580]
complaints in congress is he's not spending enough for home and security in

[00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:28.440]
the mirrors of the big cities in this country are still waiting empty handed

[00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:30.820]
where's all that money got to come from do all these things that were supposed to

[00:33:30.820 --> 00:33:31.160]
be doing

[00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:35.600]

uh...

[00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:40.800]
to the

[00:33:41.740 --> 00:33:42.740]
the key

[00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:06.260]
in the air but it's just uh very strange i think it's astrological five six seven oh five sixty

[00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:09.900]
see we're trying to do this exercising no america's right a free speech on this program

[00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:13.500]
screenless want to get to a thousand people before that stupid ballgame attendled new we got a

[00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:18.120]
long way to go we want to get a lot of people on here here and again you have to push and prod are

[00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:22.280]
you awake are you alive are you feeling anything you're feeling the change anything at all

[00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:30.180]
wqa m fine you know how you doing okay sir uh you know about this uh this deficit that uh

[00:38:30.180 --> 00:38:34.520]
the budget administration's running up here you know it's a it's an interesting thing that uh

[00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:40.200]
we should be paying attention to who holds the note on all of this debt that we're accumulating

[00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:46.260]
and that's uh the world that we're going against holds the note mainly our major trade partners

[00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:52.660]
which is number one canada a number two mexico and then china and germany written in france all

[00:38:52.660 --> 00:38:56.920]
those evil doors yeah well you know the government of tony blare is with us but the people of

[00:38:56.920 --> 00:39:02.160]
Britain certainly aren't right and so i think that there's you know a multitude of reasons why

[00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:07.640]
these people aren't hard behind the u.s. in this war and one of the reasons aside from the horror

[00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:14.300]
are i think we got the focal anions yeah well it's the major economic impact that this is going to have

[00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:21.260]
uh with all of the countries that we owe this debt to our trade deficit and right now with

[00:39:21.260 --> 00:39:26.460]
uh with green span there there are the government's plan seems to have been to lower the interest rates

[00:39:26.460 --> 00:39:33.220]
very low but uh once these economies start hiccoping and we possibly go into a slight deflationary

[00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:39.480]
mode we're going to have a major spike in interest rates which will make the debt grow uh you know

[00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:44.600]
by the way the dollar is down 43 the as-desk down six and a half points but the markets only

[00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:48.480]
been open 20 minutes we had a long way to go yeah i think i think that's probably what the

[00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:53.940]
markets are seeing here is that the longer term this goes and the greater the debt is this debt

[00:39:53.940 --> 00:39:58.980]
is owed to somebody on this this debt and this is this is a bunch that came in inheriting record

[00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:03.580]
uh surpluses in the budget how do you like that yes that's taken too long did it even before nine

[00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:07.480]
eleven it's a it's amazing and what's even more great is is that this money that they're going to

[00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:12.560]
be spending for all of these corporations to rebuild the rack and for some of the homeland

[00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:18.640]
defense that's going on is going to these companies who are offshore in Barbados because the

[00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:23.900]
well-stone amendment to the homeland security bill was stripped out the day after he was killed

[00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:29.220]
and uh the well-stone amendment was to prevent any of this homeland security or rebuilding money

[00:40:29.220 --> 00:40:34.120]
to be given to corporations that had option you know we're not paying us taxes sure makes you

[00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:37.720]
wonder about that plane crash you know listen have a great day pal I have the right weekend hang

[00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:41.360]
in there five six seven oh fine not that I'm one of those conspiracy theorists and people I've

[00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:46.660]
mentioned that and I said oh no but sure was handy hey I came in handy five six seven oh five

[00:40:46.660 --> 00:40:49.900]
sixty we've got uh let's see ninety eight and better so we're hundred votes now how much you

[00:40:49.900 --> 00:40:54.760]
want to bet how about your life on it let's bet Greg's life on it that there's over a hundred

[00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:59.220]
votes on a pool already just a matter of moments down just refurished we clicked on our brand new

[00:40:59.220 --> 00:41:06.000]
hundred and six votes oh what's your take on the war protesters they're exercising their rights

[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:10.140]
thirty six I support them a hundred percent thirty there are a bunch of commie pinko

[00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:17.700]
uh assholes fifteen I protest Moe Howard David at fourteen I'm one of them eight they're bad for

[00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:22.160]
troop morale two and they're unpatriotic one so if you take those really hostile negative

[00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:27.520]
let's see their bunch of common fifteen and uh two seventy eighteen eighteen out of one oh six

[00:41:29.140 --> 00:41:34.160]
which means eighty eight voting on the other side I mean I didn't I say this just the other day

[00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:39.620]
the idea that we have to sit here and and even talk about the fact that we have the right to express

[00:41:39.620 --> 00:41:43.380]
an opinion whether it's popular or not whether it's uh goes along with the government or not

[00:41:43.380 --> 00:41:47.040]
well what kind of crap is that what are these young people over there who are putting their

[00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:50.860]
lives on the line voluntarily by the way we don't have a draft that this is an all volunteer

[00:41:50.860 --> 00:41:55.440]
armed force now and so we do appreciate their efforts all of it's obviously being put in a wrong

[00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:58.500]
place that's what we're pissed off about but what in the world are we doing here

[00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:04.200]
what are we what are we thinking about we're thinking

[00:42:05.980 --> 00:42:10.580]
putting their lives on the line what is it that they're defending shut up yeah see there you go

[00:42:10.580 --> 00:42:15.680]
again defending American freedom well I thought that freedom is what these people don't want

[00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:20.220]
I mean this is what the right wing has always been doing for the last seven years since

[00:42:20.220 --> 00:42:24.220]
they started a flexion their muscle and everybody else went to sleep which is exactly what happened

[00:42:25.100 --> 00:42:28.840]
and that is uh you know where the ones that are going to dictate the uh course of events

[00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:31.520]
where the ones are going to call all the shots and the rest of you just dummy up

[00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:36.140]
and go step in the line behind you think it's you just fight for the right to

[00:42:36.140 --> 00:42:40.260]
there you go right exactly that's right like Martin Sheen I'm actually those kids

[00:42:40.260 --> 00:42:46.560]
in his I mentioned somebody else was the daddy five six seven oh five sixty WQ I am

[00:42:50.420 --> 00:42:54.220]
WQ I am hello yeah yes sir speaking

[00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:59.160]
hey Neil you know I don't know if you've promised if your premise is wrong about saying the

[00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:03.760]
government is suppressing people you know I've been taking all the different newspapers all around

[00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:09.160]
the world and I think it's the news media around the world that's whipping up all this thing about

[00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:14.180]
the protesters plus I don't the protesters don't get an opportunity to speak

[00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:19.500]
well I don't know what news media you've been looking at but it seems to me that the US media in fact

[00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:23.440]
I got an article on that which I'm going to get to in a minute a consultants tell radio TV

[00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:28.180]
clients the protest coverage drives off viewers why no I'm going to get to that but the fact is if

[00:43:28.180 --> 00:43:33.340]
you watch the media from anywhere from Canada from the BBC from England from Europe uh it's quite

[00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:36.340]
the contrary they're not goose stepping it aligned there the ones who are telling it a lot what's

[00:43:36.340 --> 00:43:40.560]
really happening no I agree but including about the protesters they're not not going to protesters

[00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:43.780]
no I know they're not but they're not giving them an opportunity to speak their

[00:43:43.780 --> 00:43:48.820]
sure they are why do you say that oh no I've been reading different papers from all over the place

[00:43:48.820 --> 00:43:54.180]
from where give me give me a for instance like where uh New York Times for example I get the

[00:43:54.620 --> 00:43:59.760]
I go out to zero just to see their point of view I go to newspaper in Iran see there

[00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:04.080]

[00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:47.620]
comments at the Oscars last Sunday see if you don't like what he said if you don't agree with what

[00:46:47.620 --> 00:46:52.460]
he said you're entitled if you don't like what I say you're entitled but he had a right to say it

[00:46:53.240 --> 00:46:56.540]
he had a right to write his books he had a right to make his movies which he had to go to Canada

[00:46:56.540 --> 00:46:59.820]
make the last one bowling for Columbine because nobody here would make it in this country

[00:47:04.660 --> 00:47:09.880]
so we're going to attack attack that's ball crab I think you know all you have to do is say I think

[00:47:09.880 --> 00:47:14.180]
he's full of crap that that's all right you're full of crap I don't agree with you I think that's

[00:47:14.180 --> 00:47:17.280]
a ridiculous whatever you just said or they could count it with some evidence of their own but they

[00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:20.760]
don't have it yet but you notice how much we've been getting to that all these weeks yeah I haven't

[00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:25.540]
heard any yet the fact that that that's the most evidence we've had so far as I'm a fact that

[00:47:25.540 --> 00:47:32.200]
that's it well I'm pretty convinced oh wow don't be too sure for broadcast media patriotism

[00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:36.780]
pays this is in the estates today's Washington Post it says now apparently is the time for all good

[00:47:36.780 --> 00:47:42.300]
radio and TV stations to come to the aid of their country's war this is the message pushed by broadcast

[00:47:42.300 --> 00:47:46.700]
news consultants who've been advising news and talk stations across the nation to wave the flag

[00:47:46.700 --> 00:47:53.240]
and downplay protest against the war get the following production pieces in the studio now patriotic

[00:47:53.240 --> 00:47:58.360]
music that makes you cry salute get cold chills go for the emotion advised McVeigh media a

[00:47:58.360 --> 00:48:02.840]
Cleveland-based killer crab a Cleveland-based consultant and a war manual memo to its station

[00:48:02.840 --> 00:48:07.140]
clients air the national anthem at a specified time each day as long as the USA is at war

[00:48:07.140 --> 00:48:12.700]
the company which describes itself as the largest radio consultant in the world also has been

[00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:18.380]
counseling talk show stations to make sure your hosts aren't over the top polarizing discussions

[00:48:18.380 --> 00:48:22.900]
are shaky ground this is the not time not the time to take sheep child shots to get reaction

[00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:28.060]
not what our young men and women are in harm's way the influential television news consulting firm

[00:48:28.060 --> 00:48:33.160]
Frank and maggot associate oh yeah Frank maggot associates recently put in even starker terms

[00:48:33.160 --> 00:48:38.660]
covering war protest may be harmful to a station's bottom line oh yeah how do you like that oh my

[00:48:38.660 --> 00:48:42.860]
god in a survey released last week on the eve of the war the firm grew up found that war

[00:48:42.860 --> 00:48:48.260]
protest were the topic that tend lowest among 60 far-bred viewers across the nation maggot said

[00:48:48.260 --> 00:48:52.840]
only 14% of respondents said TV news wasn't paying enough attention to anti-war demonstrations

[00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:57.060]
and peace activists just 13% thought in the event of war the news should pay more attention to

[00:48:57.060 --> 00:49:02.180]
dissent maggot who represent who's representative did not return phone calls offers no direct advice

[00:49:02.180 --> 00:49:06.700]
about what stations should do however the research has implied message reinforces any war activist

[00:49:06.700 --> 00:49:12.880]
assertions that media outlets have marginalized opposing voices and that is absolutely correct

[00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:16.640]
the anti-war woman in this country is far bigger than I was during the first few years of the Vietnam

[00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:19.620]
war but you wouldn't know what from the cover it said Adam I think you're a Washington activist

[00:49:19.620 --> 00:49:23.800]
I think the media has been completely biased you don't hear the sending voices you see people marching

[00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:27.860]
in the streets but you rarely hear what they have to say in the media many stations employ

[00:49:27.860 --> 00:49:32.220]
news consultants to offer advice about programming promotion on air personnel their influence is

[00:49:32.220 --> 00:49:35.860]
considered strongest in smaller markets where many radio and tv stations have smaller stamps

[00:49:35.860 --> 00:49:40.300]
and less experienced management of their network or big city brethren like our experience management

[00:49:40.300 --> 00:49:45.920]
here McFae sells its expertise to dozens of radio stations that offer such formats as Christian Rock

[00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:52.240]
a music rock country music a news and talk there's a thing in here about the OEM in the weeks

[00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:57.800]
leading to the war Washington talk station WTNT AM is broadcast an almost unbroken stream of pro war

[00:49:57.800 --> 00:50:02.920]
talk from Lexa G Gordon-Liddy Laura Engraham Michael Savage and Don Eimes another syndicated

[00:50:02.920 --> 00:50:08.280]
host heard on WTNT Glenn Beck promoted and staged pro war rallies in various cities drawing

[00:50:08.280 --> 00:50:13.620]
on welcome attention to his employer clear channel communications the nation's largest radio operator

[00:50:13.620 --> 00:50:18.340]
on WMAL one of Washington's most popular talk stations the daytime schedule is dominated by

[00:50:18.340 --> 00:50:22.420]
lardass limbaugh and shan hadity both of whom have long argued in favor of the war

[00:50:23.080 --> 00:50:28.480]
and then it goes about WTOP AM and FN Washington the area is only full-time all-new station has

[00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:32.500]
pitched in support of the war effort on its website it's got a whole series of related links

[00:50:32.500 --> 00:50:38.660]
including thankartroops.com all these other patriotic supporting the war WTOP's website offers

[00:50:38.660 --> 00:50:46.080]
only two links through anti-war groups united for peace and move on so this business that

[00:50:46.080 --> 00:50:51.060]
public in this country that that's why I love the cvc so much and the bbc because they're given

[00:50:51.060 --> 00:50:54.720]
news they're not cheerleading they're not worried about the bottom line they're not worried about

[00:50:54.720 --> 00:50:59.900]
slanting it and you know all of that other crap they're not worried about consultants I have a

[00:50:59.900 --> 00:51:04.000]
feeling the cbc and a bbc probably don't have consultants telling them how to do the news during

[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:09.660]
times like these so you're getting a dog and pony show is usually not getting the real news

[00:51:09.660 --> 00:51:14.340]
and on msnbc as much as their preferable the other merconette worse from romson and they want our

[00:51:14.340 --> 00:51:21.100]
poies today uh this business this hearts in floursting it's it it it takes away from the reality

[00:51:21.100 --> 00:51:24.480]
of the war they keep showing these pictures well here's sergeant joshimwats from a Washington DC

[00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:29.100]
and putting these pictures up on a bulletin board like these are actors and some kind of a movie

[00:51:29.100 --> 00:51:33.200]
not like it's real not like people are getting injured and killed not like they're in harm's way

[00:51:33.200 --> 00:51:37.960]
but it's like their characters and some kind of a made for tv movie stop demoralizing us oh sorry

[00:51:40.140 --> 00:51:45.020]
171 votes they're pouring in what's your take on a war protesters like I said 180

[00:51:45.020 --> 00:51:50.860]

[00:51:50.860 --> 00:51:56.580]
I support them 100% 49 they're a bunch of kame pink o'assles 25 13 20%

[00:51:57.240 --> 00:52:01.580]

I'm one of them 11 they're banned for troop morale six and they're on patriotic too

[00:52:09.040 --> 00:52:12.820]
that whole article by the way is on our website today on neo-wargers.com along with a lot of

[00:52:12.820 --> 00:52:21.860]
other great bedtime stories wqa m hi how are you okay I have a question I hate to play the what if

[00:52:21.860 --> 00:52:25.980]
game but it's been bothering me okay I wanted your opinion if

[00:52:26.620 --> 00:52:34.800]
Al Gore the trip was in office are we where we are today I don't think so I don't think so

[00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:38.420]
either not that I'm a big Al Gore fan even though I did vote for him but I don't think so right I

[00:52:38.420 --> 00:52:42.600]
don't think so because because the people are behind this president are not the same people who

[00:52:42.600 --> 00:52:47.260]
are behind Al Gore yeah exactly Richard Proul and Wolfowitz and Ramesford these most of these

[00:52:47.260 --> 00:52:53.280]
people are whole over from pop a bush exactly the war mongers aren't aren't back there and I'm

[00:52:53.280 --> 00:53:01.700]
thinking we're not you know we're not as gung ho to go in and keep in mind in 1999 when this

[00:53:01.700 --> 00:53:06.460]
American enterprise institute in this peanuts start when they put all this stuff in writing

[00:53:06.460 --> 00:53:12.540]
that was long before 9-11 that they had all of this stuff planned yes that's very true and I just

[00:53:12.620 --> 00:53:18.660]
you know I wonder you know I wonder many things but you know we're just not where we are today

[00:53:18.660 --> 00:53:22.560]
well just remember when people steal election they must do it for some reason well yeah I'm sure

[00:53:22.560 --> 00:53:27.980]
there was a greater plan you know in mind and I hope this wasn't it but it's a part of it it's

[00:53:27.980 --> 00:53:33.300]
a beginning it's a beginning of the scary plan yeah I just wanted to tell George I saw that

[00:53:33.300 --> 00:53:37.660]
ten and teller show last night of creationism and frightening and he for you just slapped himself in

[00:53:37.660 --> 00:53:42.680]
the head he's not supposed to do it no it was it was scary I mean he'll if it's ever on catch it

[00:53:42.680 --> 00:53:49.620]
it was scary okay I'll do it thanks a lot yeah see Al Gore maybe wouldn't and he may not have

[00:53:49.620 --> 00:53:54.240]
much of a personality not that this guy does anyway but I think we'd be in a lot the different shape

[00:53:54.680 --> 00:53:59.000]
I'm not saying 9-11 wouldn't happen because the FBI and the CIA would have been any more competent then

[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:03.920]
then they were with bush in there but the way we would have reacted to it and what would have

[00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:08.500]
been subsequent I mean you know you're you're it's just stop and think about it 50% of the

[00:54:08.500 --> 00:54:13.620]
American public believes that 9-11 was pulled off by Iraqis that Sodom had something to do with it

[00:54:13.620 --> 00:54:18.540]
not one tiny shred of evidence yet and still out one tiny shred of evidence we've been in the

[00:54:18.540 --> 00:54:25.260]
country now for over a week not one teeny tiny piece of chemical or biological weapons so far

[00:54:25.260 --> 00:54:29.860]
but those who find the suits and the atropine and the adiada yeah and of course they respotted by

[00:54:29.860 --> 00:54:33.220]
saying well of course anybody who's ready to go to war and I was going to be invaded is going to

[00:54:33.220 --> 00:54:36.980]
be prepared for a biological attack we don't believe them but nevertheless we're still looking for

[00:54:36.980 --> 00:54:46.720]
the evidence haven't found a shred not a shred not a scrap there was no connection between Sodom

[00:54:46.720 --> 00:54:51.900]
who's saying Iraq and 9-11 non-Zipity due to zero but are intelligent and believe and believe

[00:54:51.900 --> 00:54:56.980]
you me if there was you'd be what you'd be seeing it they'd be parading it around they'd be carrying

[00:54:56.980 --> 00:55:03.200]

of course we don't have any idea who's got the accounts anymore you know like the people all I

[00:58:18.080 --> 00:58:22.680]

[00:59:02.960 --> 00:59:15.160]
so carry on but here's our opinion I don't embrace as I watch the market fall it's as

[00:59:15.160 --> 00:59:24.740]
bluff I call his bull to sell feel like shoving the real facts in his face and say show me a

[00:59:24.740 --> 00:59:36.420]
commonly grown such things are good like I knew he was the Alan Greenspan way to go all over red

[00:59:36.920 --> 00:59:43.560]
and all time go the Alan Greenspan way to go

[00:59:43.560 --> 00:59:52.660]
so speed of that article I read little bits from the Washington Post up name me on on a national level

[00:59:53.180 --> 00:59:58.320]
a liberal talk show host who is against the war who is anti-disadministration who speaks his mind

[01:00:06.700 --> 01:00:14.060]
name me one can you do it no I can't I can't and as far as cheap panel communication is concerned

[01:00:14.060 --> 01:00:17.260]
stop and think about who they have on here Dr. Laura who's calling all the protesters

[01:00:17.260 --> 01:00:20.600]
communists I mean you know she and by the way that's so she had yesterday would have kind of

[01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:25.040]
eased up that seemed a little bit behind it was a tape from like two months ago but anyway Dr. Laura

[01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:31.620]
you got a large ass a Schmidt-Misturus like large ass light uh and more ways than one I guess

[01:00:31.620 --> 01:00:36.680]
and what what else is he Gordon Litty Ollie North right I'll Glenn Beck rhymes with Dreck

[01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:43.680]
I miss uh I miss any Howard sperm now is a goose stepping in a bandwagon Phil Henry Phil Henry's

[01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:47.060]
become one of those are you sure I haven't heard him do that but everybody tells me that uh

[01:00:47.060 --> 01:00:52.680]
well why is that how is that possible invasion of the body snatchers how is no seriously how is

[01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:58.340]
that possible it's somebody like our old friend Phil who was so so far to the opposite side who

[01:00:58.340 --> 01:01:04.300]
was like anti establishment and like cutting edge and just uh real goofball you know that I guess

[01:01:04.300 --> 01:01:08.140]
they're all getting the consultants are telling the same thing if you want to be on man so I think

[01:01:08.140 --> 01:01:12.300]
the people in this town not to pat myself on the back or me and George or whatever's going on

[01:01:12.300 --> 01:01:16.960]
this program but this is one of the very few places to quote that lady that I hate like poison

[01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:20.840]
I called you a few several a couple months ago but it's true this is one of the very few places

[01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:26.500]
you'll hear any voice of the scent which is which is terrifying the sense of a woman the the

[01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:33.260]
sense of a woman for which I have only one thing to say yeah yeah I don't want to make light of

[01:01:33.260 --> 01:01:38.460]
our troops but I will on a lighter note they had one of these embedded reporters with the Marines

[01:01:38.460 --> 01:01:43.160]
and as they were going through the desert yeah hitting up he said oh you can hear the Marines all

[01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:48.340]
going you know and I that's all I could think about was sent of a woman how about the set of South

[01:01:48.340 --> 01:01:54.680]
Florida you can smell a death is in the air baby remember the song love is in the air sure how about

[01:01:54.680 --> 01:02:04.520]
how about death is in the air just a thought book of Brian W.Q.A.M. hi hi yes ma'am oh this is Neil

[01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:13.020]
yes it is I'm picking everybody up cold oh okay I watched a debate just now with Daniel

[01:02:13.020 --> 01:02:20.260]
Ellsberg you know who he is right and the Republican right-winger well what we know you know

[01:02:20.260 --> 01:02:26.020]
you're being redundant Republican right-winger oh Bill Crystal oh god who that's my skin crawl

[01:02:26.020 --> 01:02:31.640]
I know he said he had to admit that he has he's contracted with Fox News uh-huh what does that

[01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:38.520]
tell you yeah but the thing that impressed me was um mr. Ellsberg he said his favorite

[01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:44.560]
source of news is the Canadian broadcast there you go I am trying to they're they're really great

[01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:49.500]
they're just bringing news they're not like uh- slanting it they're not waving pom-poms they're not

[01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:52.980]
throwing darts they're just presenting the truth and they're analyzing it and they put it all

[01:02:52.980 --> 01:02:59.920]
out there for you to digest it was number one right he was also a former Marine Ellsberg right

[01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:05.600]
and you know he wrote the Pentagon thing we're Pentagon papers right he's very informative and

[01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:12.260]
I don't think he picks candidates he picks him when he votes I think he votes with his conscience

[01:03:12.260 --> 01:03:19.320]
you know it's not Democratic Republican he'll go with the person that has morals and responsibility

[01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:24.360]
well what do we find one of those what exactly the start I think he's still looking

[01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:30.960]
mm-hmm one of the callers because I say Michael Moore for president oh how do you like that I

[01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:35.640]
I vote for him so I would vote ten times for him well one of the callers uh- suggested that the

[01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:40.960]
protesters go out there they want to have a party they want to have a huge party so that's

[01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:47.700]
why they're protesting in the streets yeah right well I'm a protester good for you well in Rochester

[01:03:47.700 --> 01:03:52.640]
in February for the first Persian Gulf War we were out there in the cold you know what Rajas

[01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:59.160]
I sure do freezing to death it was no party yeah so um these people are totally brainwashed

[01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:05.360]
good luck to us we don't thank you keep it up five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty

[01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:09.440]
on the AT&T always the same I mean if you didn't live through the Vietnam war was it

[01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:15.160]
precisely the same in the early days the war with the country was all gone whole and LBJ has given

[01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:18.720]
a solid an answer we're gonna go in there and bring freedom into democracy in the Vietnam and

[01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:23.140]
all of southeast in Asia and buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh and it's gonna be a piece of cake and we're

[01:04:23.140 --> 01:04:27.200]
gonna put uh- get him with Forza and they just kept getting more and more bogged down and more and

[01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:31.740]
more kids kept coming home in body bags and more and more lies to the American public and again

[01:04:31.740 --> 01:04:38.320]
just like now the media was almost entirely manipulated whatever the Pentagon told them that's what

[01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:44.240]
we'd hear and of course the Pentagon as it turned out was lying through their teeth just like now

[01:04:44.940 --> 01:04:48.240]
how can you say that? Come you know you'll notice we don't admit to anything

[01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:53.220]
Nobody dies because of armostates even our friendly fire. Oh, there must have been that transporter on a British plane

[01:04:53.220 --> 01:04:55.880]
It must have been there fault. Everything is somebody else's fault

[01:04:55.880 --> 01:04:59.020]
So how can there be any credibility when you listen to the Pentagon?

[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:04.640]
They have as much credibility as the Iraqi minister that's on every day with his full crap none

[01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:07.040]
None it's just full crap. It just spin

[01:05:08.680 --> 01:05:13.980]
And in the meantime while our casualties were like in the thousands and thousands in mounting and they kept saying well

[01:05:13.980 --> 01:05:20.520]
There were 16 Americans killed and 15,000 of yet the me's North Vietnamese and of course who the hell knows North Vietnamese from South Vietnamese

[01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:24.960]
Just like now and you know this last couple days they're starting to bring this out in this war

[01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:30.160]
Same thing we can't identify the enemy. We don't know the good guys from the bad guys

[01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:33.020]
See I hate to break the news to all you George W. Lookers out there

[01:05:33.020 --> 01:05:36.140]
But there's nothing on somebody's forehead at least yet

[01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:41.540]
No, they're not wearing t-shirts out there to say hey, I'm a good guy. I'm a bad guy

[01:05:41.540 --> 01:05:46.320]
Any and of course as it turns out some of the people pretend to be good guys are bad guys and the other way around sometimes

[01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:48.720]
We don't know we just don't know

[01:05:49.420 --> 01:05:55.320]
Because they're not welcoming us with open hands and hearts and flowers and they don't appreciate the fact that we've like laid waste to

[01:05:55.320 --> 01:05:56.660]
parts of their country

[01:05:57.840 --> 01:06:01.500]
And how do you like to be one of those five million people living in Baghdad now by the way?

[01:06:01.560 --> 01:06:06.360]
Why your city is rocked with these massive explosions day after day and that of course we're hearing about well

[01:06:06.360 --> 01:06:09.100]
This this pinpoint accuracy of these new weapons

[01:06:09.880 --> 01:06:12.240]
Well, what is that what does that have to do with anything?

[01:06:12.240 --> 01:06:15.060]
I mean sure we could be bombing a crap and just indiscriminately killing people

[01:06:15.060 --> 01:06:17.180]
But the world wouldn't sit still for that in any of the country

[01:06:17.740 --> 01:06:22.760]
That's the only reason they're doing that is that the public would never sit still for that even if they don't get hit

[01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:24.160]
They're choking on that oil smoke

[01:06:24.900 --> 01:06:30.560]
From the fires yeah, oil fires to provide cover right against the bombing and when you combine that with the sandstorms

[01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:34.680]
Like we had two and three days ago two days in a row and there are frequent problem there

[01:06:34.680 --> 01:06:37.900]
Are you combined all that it must be really good talking about the swell in the air?

[01:06:38.220 --> 01:06:40.720]
There was a story on NPR about how deadly that stuff is

[01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:45.920]
They're talking about how many children how many enormous hours of children are gonna become asmatic and adults as well

[01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:52.040]
Especially children asmatic and die including all of the children who have died the last 12 years under UN sanctions

[01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:58.400]
Honey, yeah exactly radio back then right listen stop and think about the facts

[01:06:58.400 --> 01:07:02.620]
Take a look what's really going on instead of being just an emotional or our political knee jerk asshole

[01:07:02.620 --> 01:07:07.840]
Okay, let me say it again both political parties in this country sucking if we're for the weak need yelling yellow

[01:07:09.100 --> 01:07:15.360]
Belly Democrats this couldn't be going on right now who all goose step down including Tom Dachel who was right there sucking around and John

[01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:20.140]
Edwards and all the other ones and the right and John Kerry whoever every other day has got a different opinion

[01:07:23.720 --> 01:07:26.940]
That billboard we got we've got balls. I sure like to see anybody in a congress

[01:07:26.940 --> 01:07:32.300]
It's got them there are a couple of people like John Connors and Charlie Wrangler. There are a few people not too many

[01:07:36.620 --> 01:07:37.420]
WQ I am

[01:07:38.520 --> 01:07:39.680]
Why yes, sir?

[01:07:40.900 --> 01:07:42.300]
Yeah, what is it?

[01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:49.060]
Who's this Neil sounds like me? I'm glad to hear you and I'm glad to hear you for this radio off a couple things so far

[01:07:50.980 --> 01:07:57.380]
First of all, I've stood on your pole. I believe that in fact I know for effect is the protests or bad for troop morale

[01:07:58.440 --> 01:08:01.700]
Yeah, I've been there and Vietnam and

[01:08:02.180 --> 01:08:09.460]
Secondly, I don't understand how our military first of all these are basically untrained troops, right?

[01:08:09.820 --> 01:08:13.660]
You know, they're they're not the combat veteran that is correct and

[01:08:14.940 --> 01:08:19.060]
They the leaders apparently of these these guys have forgotten

[01:08:19.780 --> 01:08:24.340]
What happened in Vietnam you cannot identify the enemy right like you said well ago?

[01:08:24.360 --> 01:08:30.060]
They don't have T-shirts on saying hey, I'm a good guy. I'm a bad guy. That's right and these guys with the white flags saying hey

[01:08:30.060 --> 01:08:34.980]
I'm okay and I don't agree with the guy well get used to it now happen in Vietnam it happened in Gulf War

[01:08:34.980 --> 01:08:39.700]
What happens in every war? Yes, you're absolutely correct right and I just I think

[01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:43.380]
I don't think this is a good thing

[01:08:43.380 --> 01:08:48.060]
You mean the war the war wrong with you I was I was question

[01:08:48.740 --> 01:08:54.580]
The sensibility of going in there and then all of a sudden they were in there and after watching endless hours on

[01:08:56.160 --> 01:08:57.620]
Television I'm thinking you know

[01:08:57.620 --> 01:09:01.540]
There's gonna be a lot more casual and now that they're telling us it's gonna last months probably I mean

[01:09:01.540 --> 01:09:07.200]
You know weak these turns into weeks and weeks turns into months and then like in Vietnam months turns into years

[01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:12.820]
Can you imagine the cost and for dollars and human lives that we're talking about that was a full 14 years

[01:09:12.820 --> 01:09:19.040]
12 13 year war right that's right and I don't think this will be that long and

[01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:25.180]
Everyone's questioning the the repatriates in Iraq well crap man

[01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:30.420]
We're we invaded their their land. Yes, but there are not they hate their leader. That's their property

[01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:32.240]
And they're gonna gonna

[01:09:32.840 --> 01:09:39.160]
Bitches anybody that price to I mean doesn't the American public understand the the insanity of this idea of preemptive wars

[01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:42.240]
We think that they represent a threat or they might do something to us someday

[01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:44.820]
Therefore we're gonna invade and bond the crap out of them now

[01:09:44.820 --> 01:09:50.520]
And just a concept of that is so alien to everything that this country is supposed to stand for and always has and the public saying

[01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:54.120]
Yeah, let's go get on you're right. You're right. You're right, but we did we have a choice?

[01:09:54.120 --> 01:09:56.180]
We the public of course not

[01:09:56.180 --> 01:09:58.280]
Tell them that we don't have a joy. You know something with it

[01:09:58.280 --> 01:10:01.480]
But again going back to the protesters when you say it's bad for trooper well

[01:10:01.480 --> 01:10:02.240]
I understand what you're saying

[01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:06.480]
But on the other hand if more people would have been doing that in the Democrats would have had the fortitude to do it in Congress

[01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:11.340]
Maybe would wouldn't be in there right now why I agree with that but too late now that remains we are yeah

[01:10:11.340 --> 01:10:13.620]
So I disagree with the protest

[01:10:13.620 --> 01:10:19.180]
Because I will keep but keep in mind that it was after the protest grew during Vietnam and night after night more

[01:10:19.180 --> 01:10:23.920]
Hundreds of thousands of people on television all over the country. That's what eventually brought us to

[01:10:26.820 --> 01:10:27.580]
Yes

[01:10:28.820 --> 01:10:30.980]
The Middle Eastern world

[01:10:30.980 --> 01:10:40.540]
Will be exploded to dom at people killed with the gas that we sold him first time aggressor nation and they only

[01:10:40.540 --> 01:10:48.380]
One that's going now more blood will be spilled to get that oil flowing forget about Korea and

[01:10:48.380 --> 01:10:51.680]
The notes there to do nanta were right

[01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:57.440]
Queen is really it over and over into our head

[01:10:57.440 --> 01:11:00.680]
That iraq has some

[01:11:00.680 --> 01:11:03.800]
Weapons of past destruction

[01:11:13.460 --> 01:11:20.580]
Three thousand people killed are now forgotten let's exploit them instead

[01:11:20.580 --> 01:11:31.000]
Hey, there's oil to be gone and going after sent down to play kato sama. There's no longer mention of the name in law

[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:39.340]
This but no one seems concerned all company and complacent believe in every word of this cartel administration

[01:11:39.340 --> 01:11:45.000]
That controls us by fear for lady am manipulation and a right

[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:50.900]
Queen is really it over and over into our heads

[01:11:50.900 --> 01:11:57.140]
That iraq has some weapons of past destruction

[01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:16.000]
The loss of civil rights is the rights that we're paying we're all suspects now not the ascrop is saying

[01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:20.180]
I have nothing to hide table's ockers all are saying

[01:12:20.180 --> 01:12:22.360]
I know be the end of the

[01:12:22.360 --> 01:12:28.580]
Don't have any reservations out of provoked battle and world annihilation

[01:12:28.580 --> 01:12:34.560]
Old regime must fall in have a virgin installed with no objection at all

[01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:38.100]
Till the crap don't have the balls and the right

[01:12:38.100 --> 01:12:50.040]
Queen is really it over and over into our parade was that iraq has some weapons of past destruction

[01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:58.220]
You've heard only I drag has some weapons of past destruction

[01:12:58.220 --> 01:13:01.980]
You have a certain couple of trash of everybody

[01:13:03.860 --> 01:13:07.060]
That is the greatest piece of recorded material in the history of the human race

[01:13:07.060 --> 01:13:10.380]
That's just my own humble opinion okay nice go and bokeh

[01:13:10.380 --> 01:13:15.100]
1034 or 26 to 11 I'm talking extra fast because we got that damn Marlon exhibitionist game at 10 till noon

[01:13:15.100 --> 01:13:16.400]
Good golly

[01:13:17.980 --> 01:13:24.380]
Seriously imagine the number of people going to be sitting around their radio is listen to Marlon exhibition game against the exposed two fandom teams

[01:13:25.080 --> 01:13:30.900]
Now go back to this last call or what he was talking about about how in every war these things go on these fake surrenders

[01:13:30.900 --> 01:13:37.040]
This is an on CNN today on their website CIA warned a regular Iraqi forces could pose threat

[01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:48.720]
A classified CIA intelligence report widely distributed among Bush administration policy makers and military leaders in February warned that a regular Iraqi forces could pose the greatest threat to US and coalition forces

[01:13:48.720 --> 01:14:00.040]
Especially to supply lines and rear units US officials say the reported in February 3 said bath party militia and the so called Fedein Saddam could be expected to use hit and run tactics against rear units

[01:14:00.040 --> 01:14:06.440]
The report also said that such units might fire on Iraqi civilians in order to tie down US and British forces according to US officials

[01:14:07.380 --> 01:14:16.940]
Other US intelligence reports part of the were also predicted officials say that Iraqi forces might fire on their own people in order to create scenes of civilian bloodshed suitable for propaganda used by the regime

[01:14:16.940 --> 01:14:30.120]
Which would blame the carnage on coalition forces US officials revealed the existence of the February report in response to questions about whether the tactics that have led to most of the American British deaths and POWs today were a surprise to US intelligence officials and policy makers

[01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:36.740]
And officials said the CIA report was widely distributed to policy makers and war fighters no surprise here said a US official

[01:14:36.740 --> 01:14:46.360]
All of this pain all of this make believe shock and dismay and all shocks

[01:14:47.300 --> 01:14:51.040]
We knew damn well that's what they're going to do because it happens in everywhere

[01:14:51.600 --> 01:15:01.100]
Let me ask you ask away if a foreign government were to attack us to liberate us from our illegal regime and bomb the hell out of our cities and a bunch of innocent people in the person

[01:15:02.200 --> 01:15:06.660]
Yes, we'd be taking flowers and dancing across the white plant something in the flower

[01:15:06.660 --> 01:15:12.040]
Yeah, I'd like to give a bunch of flowers to this administration

[01:15:13.900 --> 01:15:21.120]
5.670560, 0.560 on the AT&T in Verizon wireless line join George tomorrow afternoon noondatube

[01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:29.580]
Boy, you're busy either the guy about that. Wow, sorry, my name. Joe. You didn't even know you were going to be there. Noondatube tomorrow, Georgia is just busy running around trying to make a living

[01:15:29.580 --> 01:15:38.620]
Support that damn kid and the rest of the family too and Bill Siles of Boulevard of savings enjoy free food from a griller's choice in Atlantic City subs

[01:15:38.620 --> 01:15:43.540]
Where I write in the bread make the difference known to two Bill Siles Boulevard of savings, which is located at the summer

[01:15:44.660 --> 01:15:51.620]
It's 36th Street west of 27th Avenue. I had all the dealers you know, I want all the understand that but there are people out there

[01:15:51.620 --> 01:15:56.560]
Don't know that McGill didn't bother putting that in there because he's busy. Yeah running away from Doreen and

[01:15:56.560 --> 01:16:02.020]
Hey, Doreen is our pal now. Okay, the much-molyne Doreen who took all the abuse from the molemyster. Okay, heroin.

[01:16:03.500 --> 01:16:04.400]
She's on heroin.

[01:16:06.140 --> 01:16:11.160]
You know something after putting up with him, I wouldn't blame her. Hey, go up those checkered papers. Get out of here, you silly old cute.

[01:16:12.260 --> 01:16:20.780]
301 votes on the poll. What's your take out of war protesters? They're exercising their rights. 107. I support them 100% 78.

[01:16:20.780 --> 01:16:33.080]
I protest Mojaro David it is moving into third place with 44 votes. Okay, I I I there are a bunch of commie pinko assholes 41 13.6%.

[01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:44.260]
I'm one of them 17 one of the protesters. They're bad for troop morale eight and they're on patriotic six. So if you had a percentage of the negative votes, let's see 4.5 and

[01:16:45.120 --> 01:16:54.280]
13.6 is 18.1. So the 18 poor the other 82% say you go guys, whatever. In other words, even if you don't agree with them, how could anybody say they don't have a right to do it?

[01:16:55.580 --> 01:17:05.140]
They don't have the right to do it. Again, if you missed the beginning of the show, there are three letters in a row under protest protested in the editorial page in the

[01:17:05.140 --> 01:17:14.160]
middle of the day. And these three letters, which I read on the year and I'm not going to read again are just so so mind boggling to show you the mindset that we're dealing here. We're in a war so everybody else shut up.

[01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:26.920]
And this this on the heels not that many years, Vietnam made it in 75. I believe was the last year when Ford replaced our soon to be impeached and now a departed president.

[01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:38.280]
75 that's only 28 years ago. I grant you if you're like 25 now that's before you were even born, but if you're like let's say 35 40 on up, right?

[01:17:39.340 --> 01:17:46.340]
You remember I said the Vietnam sure you go. And if you're in if you're 40 and over, you certainly remember vividly.

[01:17:46.700 --> 01:17:53.840]
See, when you look at these polls, by the way, like in time in Newsweek, and you'll see that the most gong hole for this war are like 18 to 34 year olds.

[01:17:54.940 --> 01:18:08.760]
At least the ones who aren't over there because we have no draft. I wonder number one, if those 18 to 34 year olds would be so gong ho if they had to be the ones who were over there doing the fighting and be involved in all this insanity that's going on and be if they really had been alive during Vietnam.

[01:18:09.680 --> 01:18:22.360]
And not only was Vietnam a discretion in terms of the administration of Johnson and Nixon and Kissinger and all the lies and the generals and all the bull crap, which of course now Bob McNamara all of them all while writing books.

[01:18:22.360 --> 01:18:27.740]
We made a mistake. We lied. Well, a little bit late now. You know, it's not going to bring back those 58,000 people in the body bags.

[01:18:31.300 --> 01:18:37.440]
But it was a disgrace from the standpoint that when a lot of those young people came back from Vietnam, a lot of those soldiers who had been drafted by the way.

[01:18:38.300 --> 01:18:42.740]
And they came back from being traumatized over there. They were treated like crap when they came back to this country.

[01:18:43.780 --> 01:18:50.260]
They became the pariahs, not the politicians, not the generals, not the people who forced them to be there and butchered up all those innocent, the men, women and children.

[01:18:50.860 --> 01:18:52.940]
But they became the pariahs here in their own society.

[01:18:53.940 --> 01:18:58.860]
Tragedy, a horrendous chapter in American history and I have a feeling that we might just be doing it again.

[01:19:00.620 --> 01:19:05.320]
I hope not. I hope the whole thing is over by the weekend. I hope when we come back Monday, well guess what?

[01:19:05.320 --> 01:19:11.560]
They all came in. They surrendered. Sodoms go to the French Riviera and the life goes on and we're going to like install democracy over there.

[01:19:12.220 --> 01:19:17.480]
Right. Stop and think about that. We're going to install our government when you want it or not.

[01:19:18.540 --> 01:19:24.840]
And keep in mind, I mean, even though it's war between two different sets of religious fanatics, which I think one of our pieces on the website talks about that.

[01:19:25.380 --> 01:19:29.160]
But keep in mind that these people aren't coming from the same places we are at all.

[01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:33.920]
How can you say that we don't want the best for them?

[01:19:33.940 --> 01:19:36.560]
Wrong headgear. Yeah. Yeah. We know what's best for you.

[01:19:36.940 --> 01:19:40.180]
So, dummy up and let us install our government, our puppet or else.

[01:19:40.560 --> 01:19:42.980]
Including that general from Orlando that we talked about yesterday.

[01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:49.020]
Who just happened to be good buddies with all these right wing chicken hawks. One of their people.

[01:19:49.660 --> 01:19:59.140]
I mean, it's so transparent. It's so obvious. All you have to do is read for like 10 minutes a day and you'll see what the linkage between all these people, who they are, what they're all about, how long they've planned on the day.

[01:19:59.140 --> 01:20:08.660]
All of us and what their plans are for beyond us. And you'll say, oh my God. I think 19 to 11 at 560, Ravel Rousing Radio WQAM.

[01:20:08.860 --> 01:20:12.940]
My and local. This is for 305. 60.

[01:20:16.620 --> 01:20:20.080]
What believe a word? Neil said it. The tongue was notarized.

Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, 15. Watch the dirt away. We're gonna watch the watch, watch the dirt away.

[01:20:30.260 --> 01:20:35.220]
We're gonna soapy soap, dope the dirt away. And we know when we're in the tub, we watch the dirt away.

[01:20:40.420 --> 01:21:04.700]

I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub

[01:27:01.180 --> 01:27:24.620]
I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub

[01:27:29.220 --> 01:27:54.600]

[01:28:00.340 --> 01:28:24.580]
I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub

[01:28:35.400 --> 01:28:54.560]
I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub

[01:29:11.660 --> 01:29:24.540]
I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub

[01:29:26.980 --> 01:29:54.520]
I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub, I'm in the tub

[01:29:54.520 --> 01:30:02.480]
Who do you feel more strongly about? Either positively or negatively? George, Neil, Mohaw or David, you see what I'm saying?

[01:30:03.140 --> 01:30:11.340]
No, no, no, no, I'm talking about a radio people. Who do you feel more strong? Because the people out there, there are like a bunch of them who just hate you like poison.

[01:30:11.560 --> 01:30:13.800]
Yeah, there are some who like you a lot.

[01:30:13.840 --> 01:30:14.660]
But third man!

[01:30:17.400 --> 01:30:23.080]
But, you know, basically for the god is criminal, don't you know, I'm creating blasphemy by doing what?

[01:30:23.080 --> 01:30:30.020]
By filling in for you. Oh, well thank goodness for that, especially when I've been sick by taking that clinics and aspirin.

[01:30:30.200 --> 01:30:32.720]
And I'm not taking the Botox into Botox by the way.

[01:30:34.340 --> 01:30:39.180]
I'm not taking nothing up the Botox, contrary to popular rumor around town.

[01:30:40.020 --> 01:30:44.380]
Now we're gonna have to like really, we better do that, we better rush along if you part that expression ball boy.

[01:30:44.640 --> 01:30:48.580]
You know what this is like today? It's like handing over the audience to rush anybody else.

[01:30:48.660 --> 01:30:55.260]
Here you go. The less than an hour we're gonna just hand the audience over to somebody else because we got a stupid exhibition baseball going on.

[01:30:55.460 --> 01:30:56.280]
Nice go and Greg.

[01:30:56.280 --> 01:30:59.800]
5 and look all this is 560.

[01:31:00.260 --> 01:31:01.280]
The radio's on your...

[01:31:02.340 --> 01:31:03.500]
You win!

[01:31:04.020 --> 01:31:04.020]

[01:31:05.640 --> 01:31:08.020]
Friday you bastard!

[01:31:09.180 --> 01:31:23.840]
Go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go

[01:31:52.820 --> 01:31:59.220]
and I thrust with ped eerste my man friend did it it I'll just head make up with jitter someday

[01:31:59.220 --> 01:32:07.040]
and then ask him to write my pun right coffee very nover again

[01:32:08.740 --> 01:32:14.140]
though I would not feel the most nice no and I would not

[01:32:14.140 --> 01:32:20.160]
Be ashamed about a ginger and more gay union

[01:32:20.160 --> 01:32:23.800]
Just bold and then stroking away

[01:32:23.800 --> 01:32:28.420]
I die, I always kill you're not my type

[01:32:28.420 --> 01:32:29.520]
Yeah!

[01:32:29.840 --> 01:32:32.620]
You sound like a nine year old kid

[01:32:32.620 --> 01:32:33.020]
Hey!

[01:32:33.680 --> 01:32:36.260]
Get only a macho manly guy

[01:32:36.260 --> 01:32:37.540]
You don't know this!

[01:32:37.780 --> 01:32:40.220]
That makes me flip my wig

[01:32:41.160 --> 01:32:44.200]
If ginger was a lover of mine

[01:32:45.280 --> 01:32:48.240]
I'd bury my boldest feigny nose

[01:32:48.240 --> 01:32:52.260]
And sight is simply re-rended

[01:32:52.260 --> 01:32:52.860]
Welcome!

[01:32:53.940 --> 01:32:57.220]
No, I would not be a sport old

[01:32:57.220 --> 01:33:00.740]
Now, if I was not a closet of fame

[01:33:00.740 --> 01:33:04.760]
That's why a ginger and more gay union

[01:33:04.760 --> 01:33:08.880]
Would make me feel dizzy and gay

[01:33:08.880 --> 01:33:09.940]
You're gay!

[01:33:11.220 --> 01:33:14.460]
Yeah, ginger and more gay union

[01:33:14.460 --> 01:33:18.500]
Would make my swirl pony ass just safe

[01:33:18.500 --> 01:33:22.660]
If we had a ginger and more gay union

[01:33:22.660 --> 01:33:25.920]
And any wooden have to get me raped

[01:33:25.920 --> 01:33:27.880]
It's a Lv. 02 at 560 WQAM

[01:33:28.420 --> 01:33:31.280]
The station would be gigantic balls donna

[01:33:31.280 --> 01:33:33.500]
We got big fat oozing balls

[01:33:33.500 --> 01:33:35.120]
Elephant balls to WQAM

[01:33:35.120 --> 01:33:36.940]
I noticed coming to work this morning

[01:33:36.940 --> 01:33:38.760]
I was always on the other ones

[01:33:38.760 --> 01:33:40.820]
Did they have sports logos on mine?

[01:33:40.880 --> 01:33:41.660]
I never noticed that

[01:33:42.120 --> 01:33:43.320]
I didn't see any

[01:33:43.320 --> 01:33:44.280]
I haven't paid no attention

[01:33:44.280 --> 01:33:46.920]
I see them all the time

[01:33:46.920 --> 01:33:50.800]
I saw the ones on the turn pack

[01:33:50.800 --> 01:33:51.640]
They're all over the place

[01:33:51.640 --> 01:33:54.420]
We have five billboards

[01:33:54.420 --> 01:33:55.800]
Which means one for each year

[01:33:55.800 --> 01:33:57.860]
On the station

[01:33:59.240 --> 01:34:00.280]
And of course Moe

[01:34:00.280 --> 01:34:01.080]
He's been here one year

[01:34:01.080 --> 01:34:01.720]
He's got one

[01:34:03.080 --> 01:34:03.980]
And on his

[01:34:03.980 --> 01:34:05.980]
On his billboard

[01:34:05.980 --> 01:34:08.000]
Which I see in the turn pack right around Gryffin Road

[01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.720]
And there's the logos of all the sports teams

[01:34:10.720 --> 01:34:11.980]
I have a new of them!

[01:34:12.400 --> 01:34:14.380]
We got big balls

[01:34:14.380 --> 01:34:15.820]
And nobody's going to intimidate us

[01:34:15.820 --> 01:34:18.200]
Except the course of certain people

[01:34:19.240 --> 01:34:19.700]
WQAM

[01:34:20.540 --> 01:34:22.260]
I've heard your part

[01:34:23.180 --> 01:34:24.840]
Speaking, but I can barely hear you

[01:34:24.840 --> 01:34:25.620]
Hey, what's up, Neil?

[01:34:26.300 --> 01:34:28.620]
I've been watching that movie

[01:34:28.620 --> 01:34:30.060]
Boat ship with Kid the Gooding Jr

[01:34:30.680 --> 01:34:33.000]
And also, how many ferrys you think are fighting in?

[01:34:33.960 --> 01:34:34.400]
WQAM

[01:34:36.800 --> 01:34:37.240]
QAM

[01:34:37.240 --> 01:34:38.580]
Hey, can I do the Neil?

[01:34:38.740 --> 01:34:39.020]
Speaking

[01:34:40.520 --> 01:34:42.520]
I'm listening to you, and I hear you

[01:34:42.520 --> 01:34:44.500]
And you tell these guys the hang in there

[01:34:45.720 --> 01:34:47.480]
What would you like me to tell them?

[01:34:47.960 --> 01:34:50.060]
I go back to the election

[01:34:50.060 --> 01:34:52.680]
And hang in there, we got another one coming up

[01:34:52.680 --> 01:34:54.500]
And they stupid asses

[01:34:54.500 --> 01:34:56.520]
They don't change anything

[01:34:56.520 --> 01:34:58.040]
They put a captain in here

[01:34:58.940 --> 01:35:00.240]
And they give you a letter

[01:35:00.240 --> 01:35:01.680]
And they push by a landslide

[01:35:01.680 --> 01:35:03.360]
And look, I mean, I can do

[01:35:03.360 --> 01:35:05.680]
I can't hold it by the hand and take them forcibly

[01:35:05.680 --> 01:35:07.360]
And make them do what they should do

[01:35:08.320 --> 01:35:10.720]
You're right, but it is so freaking scary

[01:35:10.720 --> 01:35:13.420]
That the people just, you know, they got their head in the sand

[01:35:13.420 --> 01:35:14.700]
And they don't want to open their eyes

[01:35:14.700 --> 01:35:16.400]
And see what's really going on around them

[01:35:16.400 --> 01:35:18.320]
And they use the same old tire tactics

[01:35:18.320 --> 01:35:20.100]
Oh, Bill McRide, he's going to raise your taxes

[01:35:20.100 --> 01:35:22.240]
To paper that education thing, the classroom thing

[01:35:22.240 --> 01:35:24.180]
And then right away the people buy into that

[01:35:24.180 --> 01:35:26.280]
And then of course as soon as the election is over

[01:35:26.280 --> 01:35:28.640]
Here's this lunatic that we call the governor

[01:35:28.640 --> 01:35:30.020]
Well, we're going to subvert

[01:35:30.020 --> 01:35:32.600]
Which he already got caught on tape saying the thing

[01:35:32.600 --> 01:35:35.420]
We're going to have the public rescind that class size thing

[01:35:35.420 --> 01:35:37.220]
And now they're saying, well, you don't have to do that

[01:35:37.220 --> 01:35:38.780]
It's not going to cost as much as we thought

[01:35:38.780 --> 01:35:41.460]
The public just keeps shooting themselves in the feed

[01:35:41.460 --> 01:35:43.440]
I think we got a bunch of massacres out there

[01:35:43.440 --> 01:35:44.340]
They enjoy the punishment

[01:35:44.820 --> 01:35:47.320]
I agree, and I'm listening to that

[01:35:47.920 --> 01:35:48.940]
Michael Moore's book

[01:35:48.940 --> 01:35:51.100]
I listen to a driving around on audio

[01:35:51.100 --> 01:35:51.520]
Right

[01:35:51.520 --> 01:35:54.380]
If people could just if they don't want have the time to read

[01:35:54.380 --> 01:35:55.980]
If they just listen to the guy

[01:35:55.980 --> 01:35:56.340]
Yep

[01:35:56.880 --> 01:35:58.220]
That's all they need

[01:35:58.220 --> 01:36:00.960]
And that ought to light a fire under their ass

[01:36:00.960 --> 01:36:03.000]
And get them to thinking about this

[01:36:03.520 --> 01:36:04.200]
Don't hold your breath

[01:36:04.200 --> 01:36:05.180]
Yeah, you're right

[01:36:05.180 --> 01:36:06.980]
Listen, I appreciate the show

[01:36:06.980 --> 01:36:07.940]
Okay, thanks a lot

[01:36:09.180 --> 01:36:11.280]
Five, six, eight, I wish we could make a big difference

[01:36:11.280 --> 01:36:13.520]
But no, we won't

[01:36:13.520 --> 01:36:15.620]
But at least we have the opportunity to say something

[01:36:15.620 --> 01:36:17.560]
And we're doing it, that's all it's a best you can do

[01:36:17.560 --> 01:36:18.520]
And as we can

[01:36:18.520 --> 01:36:22.440]
And there's one little tiny place on a crappy little station on the end of the dial with a signal

[01:36:22.840 --> 01:36:23.580]
Bumper on A

[01:36:23.580 --> 01:36:25.280]
And it sounds like it's coming through a strainer

[01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:26.880]
But that's the best we can do

[01:36:26.880 --> 01:36:28.120]
But at least we're trying to do something

[01:36:30.820 --> 01:36:31.820]
W-Q-A-M

[01:36:32.360 --> 01:36:33.520]
Yes, good morning, Neil

[01:36:33.520 --> 01:36:34.480]
I'm back to you, okay

[01:36:35.260 --> 01:36:37.900]
Yeah, there are no balls on your billboard

[01:36:38.340 --> 01:36:39.380]
Oh, I know that

[01:36:40.340 --> 01:36:42.200]
Oh, you know, I'm wearing the sports team

[01:36:42.200 --> 01:36:43.300]
That's how you meant like real ones

[01:36:44.800 --> 01:36:46.680]
Now the sports team, no balls on that

[01:36:46.680 --> 01:36:48.780]
Okay, anyway, you two make a difference

[01:36:48.780 --> 01:36:50.740]
At least you make a difference in my day

[01:36:50.740 --> 01:36:52.540]
And even the people who get in my camp

[01:36:52.540 --> 01:36:54.740]
Come out of town and I have it on my radio

[01:36:54.740 --> 01:36:56.100]
And people go, who's that?

[01:36:56.400 --> 01:36:58.480]
They asked me to turn it up

[01:36:58.480 --> 01:37:00.700]
Because even, oh, like you say

[01:37:00.700 --> 01:37:03.060]
All around the country, there isn't much of this going on

[01:37:03.060 --> 01:37:04.920]
And it's just ridiculous

[01:37:04.920 --> 01:37:07.400]
Because driving around all day, I just saw some more on

[01:37:07.400 --> 01:37:09.260]
With a bumpers that go on the backwards truck

[01:37:09.260 --> 01:37:11.040]
With the number three for Dale Earnhardt

[01:37:11.040 --> 01:37:12.160]
And one time, the other one

[01:37:12.680 --> 01:37:14.880]
Said, sore lose them in

[01:37:14.880 --> 01:37:17.040]
And still riding around with these stupid bumper sticks

[01:37:17.040 --> 01:37:19.820]
Yeah, I saw some more on with one that even said

[01:37:19.820 --> 01:37:21.140]
Gems for US Senate

[01:37:21.960 --> 01:37:24.020]
Hey, at least they get them out of here anyway

[01:37:24.460 --> 01:37:26.060]
Neil, keep on doing what you're doing

[01:37:26.060 --> 01:37:27.360]
And at least you make some people fake

[01:37:27.360 --> 01:37:28.180]
Thanks a lot, pal

[01:37:29.320 --> 01:37:30.040]
See you

[01:37:30.040 --> 01:37:32.260]
Did I say, Pally? I shouldn't have said Pally

[01:37:32.260 --> 01:37:33.320]
Hi, Pally!

[01:37:34.520 --> 01:37:35.760]
560, 750, 560

[01:37:35.760 --> 01:37:38.320]
We're going to do the brakes early because we've got to like, uh, yeah

[01:37:38.760 --> 01:37:40.860]
We're going to accelerate the hour, apologize for that

[01:37:40.860 --> 01:37:42.520]
But we have nothing to do with this baseball crap

[01:37:42.520 --> 01:37:44.000]
We'll use the time compression machine

[01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.220]
Yeah, we're going to compress it as tight as we can

[01:37:46.220 --> 01:37:47.700]
And the hour two was that choice, right?

[01:37:47.840 --> 01:37:48.580]
Yes indeed

[01:37:48.580 --> 01:37:50.420]
That's three times three strikes in your outtroy

[01:37:50.420 --> 01:37:51.540]
Towards our favorite guy

[01:37:51.540 --> 01:37:53.200]
He's the only guy

[01:37:53.200 --> 01:37:55.860]
He's the pimped for the life of the sales department in fact

[01:37:55.860 --> 01:37:57.800]
And we got to get try on that picture somewhere

[01:37:57.800 --> 01:38:01.300]
We got to like take a dark magic marker and paste them on

[01:38:01.300 --> 01:38:04.180]
Yeah, Troy doesn't want to be associated with those assholes on that post

[01:38:04.180 --> 01:38:04.740]
Right on Plania

[01:38:04.740 --> 01:38:06.240]
Because they're dropping like flies

[01:38:06.240 --> 01:38:07.420]
There's John penis he's gone

[01:38:08.040 --> 01:38:09.400]
There's Adam Stulverman he's gone

[01:38:09.400 --> 01:38:10.400]
There's Frank with a cigar

[01:38:10.400 --> 01:38:12.900]
He had to business on the street car he's gone

[01:38:13.320 --> 01:38:14.960]
There's a PD Lenny who's just gone

[01:38:14.960 --> 01:38:16.200]
There's Brian Schmoetz is gone

[01:38:16.200 --> 01:38:19.020]
All we got left from that, let's see, 24689

[01:38:19.020 --> 01:38:22.340]
You got Adam was a good guy but uh, real quiet and get screwed over

[01:38:22.340 --> 01:38:25.860]
You got Todd Drek who lives up to his name and fat boy in Scrooan

[01:38:27.760 --> 01:38:29.240]
Mmm, mmm, mmm

[01:38:29.240 --> 01:38:31.820]
You know something, I thought I smelled something here

[01:38:31.820 --> 01:38:33.740]
Now look over there with that picture I see where it's coming from

[01:38:33.740 --> 01:38:34.740]
Kinda smells like

[01:38:34.740 --> 01:38:35.040]
Roy!

[01:38:35.720 --> 01:38:41.000]

But here's a store that's there to try to help you do it

[01:38:46.020 --> 01:38:50.140]
The lights of West Boka, a super store for ratkins, divers, running low carb sugar free diet

They got an knowledgeable staff that knows adkins and low carb dieting inside and out

[01:39:22.220 --> 01:39:24.300]
And they're open seven days a week from 10 to 10

At Delights they carry the most complete line of adkins brand products

[01:41:27.880 --> 01:41:29.320]
QA and hello yes sir

[01:41:29.320 --> 01:41:31.340]
Good morning Neil and back to you

[01:41:31.340 --> 01:41:35.260]
Uh you know for since our inception we've had political satire

[01:41:35.260 --> 01:41:42.780]
And it really bugs me that uh the thing about condolese you can't play that not that it's important at all

[01:41:44.380 --> 01:41:44.900]
Right

[01:41:44.900 --> 01:41:53.080]
And uh why is it now we've had two generations of people so dumb with no historical reference that they can't

[01:41:53.080 --> 01:41:59.780]
They have to accept the fact that you're either this or that you're shallow one dimensional you can't have a mind to your own

[01:41:59.780 --> 01:41:59.980]
Right

[01:41:59.980 --> 01:42:04.720]
It just upsets the hell out of me that uh this is what's going on

[01:42:04.720 --> 01:42:10.200]
Read a history book it's all about dumbing them up first and then taking over

[01:42:10.200 --> 01:42:14.740]
I said a few years ago that I wanted to write a book called the Dumbing of American I think I should have done it

[01:42:14.740 --> 01:42:23.960]
You oughta done it it's happening the omni-er age and I have some historical reference I'm not the brightest bulb in the sign but if I can see it it's got to be there

[01:42:24.540 --> 01:42:28.140]
I love your show Neil keep it up here you're the only smart guy on the radio

[01:42:28.140 --> 01:42:29.980]
That's what I always tell him okay thanks a lot pal

[01:42:30.680 --> 01:42:32.860]
I'm the only smart guy on radio anybody believe me?

[01:42:32.880 --> 01:42:33.920]
No me either

[01:42:33.920 --> 01:42:40.180]
5 6 7 0 5 6 you don't forget join George tomorrow noon to two at Bill Scydles Boulevard of Savings enjoy free food from

[01:42:40.180 --> 01:42:45.400]
Griller's Choice in Atlantic City subs and get there early because uh the people who work there at Bill Scydles like to

[01:42:45.400 --> 01:42:47.660]
Hop up all the free food before the audience gets there

[01:42:48.680 --> 01:42:52.980]
So get there real early and maybe there'll be some of the few scraps left over for you and of course George will be there

[01:42:52.980 --> 01:42:55.120]
Maybe get a scrap with him

[01:42:55.660 --> 01:42:58.880]
Maybe let's have naked pictures from yesterday's uh lifestyles convention

[01:43:00.300 --> 01:43:02.380]
He said there were a lot of boobs that showed up there

[01:43:03.860 --> 01:43:04.680]
WQ I am

[01:43:05.680 --> 01:43:06.800]
Hello? Yes sir

[01:43:06.800 --> 01:43:08.760]
Well sir how you doing?

[01:43:09.820 --> 01:43:15.200]
I'm talking about this war stuff but um a lot of people don't understand what's going on right here

[01:43:15.200 --> 01:43:15.800]
And what is it?

[01:43:15.820 --> 01:43:24.740]
The head of the emergency management had to resign because TV TV striver the day county manager wanted him to lie

[01:43:24.740 --> 01:43:29.340]
And say that we were totally ready for a terrorist attack

[01:43:29.340 --> 01:43:30.000]
Right

[01:43:30.740 --> 01:43:34.500]
And don't forget about the uh latest scandal at the airport too but that just passed me

[01:43:34.500 --> 01:43:37.000]
I mean I'm working airlines is about to file bankruptcy

[01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:37.420]
Right

[01:43:37.420 --> 01:43:40.320]
Which is one of the biggest employers in day county

[01:43:40.320 --> 01:43:40.580]
Right

[01:43:40.580 --> 01:43:42.900]
I mean it's just and then you know

[01:43:42.900 --> 01:43:47.540]
Pinka Peking was in bed with them to get them to make a hub down here

[01:43:47.540 --> 01:43:51.140]
So you could have enough money to do all this crap over at MIA

[01:43:51.140 --> 01:43:58.300]
And now it's like the commission has to uh swear in everybody because they don't trust anybody from the government

[01:43:58.300 --> 01:44:00.060]
I mean it's ridiculous

[01:44:00.060 --> 01:44:03.740]
Well at least I got something in common with them anyway I don't trust anyone in the government either

[01:44:03.740 --> 01:44:05.400]
And by the way George did you get your stuff?

[01:44:05.600 --> 01:44:07.160]
I got it I got it I'm holding on to it right now

[01:44:07.160 --> 01:44:08.160]
He's smoking it right now

[01:44:09.180 --> 01:44:10.460]
He's squeezing it real hard

[01:44:10.460 --> 01:44:12.180]
That's for you baby, we have a good one

[01:44:12.180 --> 01:44:13.500]
Thanks amigo now what are those?

[01:44:13.680 --> 01:44:18.120]
Much of CDs uh VCDs of a cartoon from my daughter

[01:44:18.540 --> 01:44:18.900]
Alright

[01:44:18.900 --> 01:44:21.520]
Thank you sir, George's thank you very much

[01:44:22.120 --> 01:44:25.520]
That was down the only 18, that's down the only a couple of points things are looking really good

[01:44:25.520 --> 01:44:28.560]
Well I mean as compared to like a catastrophe

[01:44:29.480 --> 01:44:33.920]
But I have a feeling that if this work continues to go on longer and if they're starting to see

[01:44:33.920 --> 01:44:36.080]
It's going to go on for months and months and months

[01:44:36.080 --> 01:44:37.400]
I have I could be wrong

[01:44:37.880 --> 01:44:42.720]
But I have a feeling that this whole investment thing a lot of other people are going to wind up losing their ass

[01:44:42.720 --> 01:44:46.220]
And when you look in fact let's go back to that for one moment please there's that screen

[01:44:46.220 --> 01:44:48.460]
Now they're doing a spot, damn it

[01:44:49.140 --> 01:44:52.560]
But when you look like a JDS Unifase like $2.93 a share

[01:44:52.560 --> 01:44:55.540]
And the prices of some of these other highly touted stocks

[01:44:56.960 --> 01:44:58.900]
Cisco the greatest company in the world

[01:44:58.900 --> 01:45:01.940]
Shikricks all these other you know they're all in the cramp or man

[01:45:01.940 --> 01:45:03.460]

[01:45:04.400 --> 01:45:07.140]
Some microsystems like $23 bucks a share whatever the hell this

[01:45:09.800 --> 01:45:12.040]
I forget I forget that uh

[01:45:13.440 --> 01:45:19.380]
Palm which I think they split it I gave you like 85 shares for a one maybe worth 85 maybe was about 30 man

[01:45:19.380 --> 01:45:20.880]
But still I worth anything

[01:45:22.920 --> 01:45:26.620]
Uh gigantic fraud this is what's going on in the rest of the public were sitting back on

[01:45:26.620 --> 01:45:29.920]
Little remember like that whether it's N Ron whether it's global crossing

[01:45:29.920 --> 01:45:32.480]
Whoever the hell it is all these tech stocks that were pile of crap

[01:45:32.480 --> 01:45:34.200]
You know what I'm going to do starting next week

And I'm going to get a bunch of my money back

[01:45:39.500 --> 01:45:45.680]
I'm not going to wait for Rimmer anymore because he's a bad you know one of those good guy but just uh you know talks a good game to do anything

[01:45:45.680 --> 01:45:48.220]

I'm gonna sue and I'm gonna get my money back and I you know every time one of these ads comes on TV

[01:45:53.760 --> 01:46:00.020]
If you were if you're a broker invested more than 25% of your portfolio in tech and you lost a zillion dollars

[01:46:00.020 --> 01:46:03.400]
You know I'm gonna I'm gonna call these ambulance chasing bastards and get some my money back

[01:46:03.400 --> 01:46:07.800]
You go girl I was rafed it most it was rate bet I was rafed it a lot worse

[01:46:07.800 --> 01:46:10.780]
And we all know gang rapes not fun that's exactly right

[01:46:12.600 --> 01:46:18.840]
Oh I have a very low tolerance for a risk and then you go in there and this guy is well I double you down on this and I'm doing that and I'm about you know full crap

[01:46:18.840 --> 01:46:23.120]

[01:46:27.880 --> 01:46:28.240]
Okay

[01:46:29.760 --> 01:46:31.980]
Oh Neil yes sir I'm sorry about that

[01:46:31.980 --> 01:46:32.700]
Go be sorry

[01:46:32.700 --> 01:46:34.740]
I'm expecting you to pick up so quick

[01:46:34.740 --> 01:46:36.200]
I'd like to pick it up real quick

[01:46:36.800 --> 01:46:37.860]
How's it going great

[01:46:38.420 --> 01:46:40.480]
I'm not calling to get your ass or anything

[01:46:40.480 --> 01:46:42.240]
Go ahead I'll bend over right now

[01:46:42.240 --> 01:46:44.460]
I love you no no I'm not calling for that

[01:46:44.460 --> 01:46:46.580]
I love you I'll listen to you all the time though

[01:46:46.580 --> 01:46:51.500]
I just uh something you said yesterday though I just wanted to take a little exception with

[01:46:51.500 --> 01:46:54.640]
I'm not I'm not in agreement really with you as far as the worst thing

[01:46:54.640 --> 01:46:59.140]
I think I'm a little I'm a little more though I consider myself a liberal on most things

[01:46:59.140 --> 01:47:03.140]
I'm not really in agreement but you said something about um when you talk about how it's turned

[01:47:03.140 --> 01:47:03.940]
How he's um

[01:47:05.480 --> 01:47:06.620]
Pandering to the right

[01:47:06.620 --> 01:47:09.220]
Well oh my well let me just explain something

[01:47:09.220 --> 01:47:11.440]
You know I don't listen to Howard so I don't know that for a fact

[01:47:11.440 --> 01:47:13.240]
But we did have we didn't have a facts

[01:47:13.240 --> 01:47:18.640]
That said that and I've had other people tell me that that he's gone gung ho on behind bush and award so on

[01:47:18.640 --> 01:47:21.920]
If I'm wrong about that then I'll retract it but I don't know

[01:47:21.920 --> 01:47:25.920]
He is pretty gung ho over he is gung ho about the war and he is and he is uh

[01:47:25.920 --> 01:47:29.460]
I would say you know more pro war than he is against it

[01:47:29.460 --> 01:47:35.180]
But I mean just for this panning I mean you can't you can't just count the fact that maybe he's just saying what he is thinking because

[01:47:35.180 --> 01:47:41.800]
I could like I don't believe that you're panning to the liberal than any democrats by saying what you saying I think you're saying what you believe

[01:47:41.800 --> 01:47:47.540]
No I have a panning in liberals I wouldn't be saying the democratic party sucks and there's a bunch of cowards which I say all the time

[01:47:47.540 --> 01:47:53.260]
That's true I don't think you're panning so I just want to say that I really I really don't believe that he's panning for the right or anything

[01:47:53.260 --> 01:47:59.240]
I think I think the point that the facts are what's trying to make and I agreed with it then and I still agree with it now is that he's he's

[01:47:59.240 --> 01:48:05.020]
sucking up to the very same people who would love to nothing better than to get him off the ear and have been trying to get him off the ear for years

[01:48:05.020 --> 01:48:11.300]
It's ironic and it is very ironic you're right because it is true but it's unfortunate that he can't see through that

[01:48:13.140 --> 01:48:22.120]
Yeah well I don't know I just don't I just don't think if someone's not of the you know of the same mind you can't just automatically say that they're panning for the right because you know

[01:48:22.120 --> 01:48:25.260]
Hey everyone's got the can I have their own uh take on it

[01:48:25.260 --> 01:48:34.900]
At least as of today it's still allowed yeah okay thanks a lot pal all right thanks yeah 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line

[01:48:34.900 --> 01:48:40.980]
400 and what is it 436 votes the votes are pouring in most of them say we don't want to hear that Marlon game we do though

[01:48:41.640 --> 01:48:47.320]
Because this is a nice way to get out of here for a nice extended weekend it's a beautiful thing make like a couple hours extra on a weekend

[01:48:47.320 --> 01:48:50.680]
I thought you were just joking yesterday when you said ballgame at 1150 what

[01:48:50.680 --> 01:48:57.160]
Well I guess they figured Montreal the frogs up there might as well play the game early nobody's gonna show up anyway

[01:48:57.160 --> 01:49:02.920]
In fact I'm sure that at Montreal those expose are gonna have a huge crowd to see that very big exhibition game today

[01:49:02.920 --> 01:49:08.780]
But third man at the very least I want to hurt mode this morning coming to work I heard him talking about the braves have

[01:49:08.780 --> 01:49:14.620]
Schmidt can the skip carry and Pete van Weer and who's kind of boring but they put them over on the radio

[01:49:15.800 --> 01:49:21.060]
And I hate to agree with mode too much but nevertheless he is right on that I love skip here he's great

[01:49:21.900 --> 01:49:27.240]
People don't do people don't watch a ballgame if they have no interest in it people watch teams play who have an interest

[01:49:27.240 --> 01:49:30.820]
Either in watching their team win or else you can get their ass kicked one or the other

[01:49:31.700 --> 01:49:35.460]
And then of course gildi man I know you wrong I don't want to hear a home or he should just be out of it

[01:49:35.460 --> 01:49:40.540]
Gildi you're such a little suck hole okay which is one more reason we don't want gildi doing them Panther games next season

[01:49:40.540 --> 01:49:46.660]
I'm all for jigs man the jigsmice do we don't want to see him get stabbed in the back right sure we'll just get him another one of those

[01:49:46.660 --> 01:49:52.620]
Eye operations so we can see whatever the hell's going on in fact when the Panther games this year you don't want to see too much of what's going on you sure don't

[01:49:52.620 --> 01:49:58.380]
Miss too many goals WQ I am yes sir speaking

[01:49:58.980 --> 01:50:06.760]
Neil yes I think the amicadon is inevitable and I believe that Jeremiah was a bullfrog Jeremiah 61

[01:50:06.760 --> 01:50:15.040]
Mm-hmm Jeremiah was a bullfrog in fact I think he croaked good friend of mine 5 6 7 0 5 60 5 60 on the AT&T

[01:50:15.040 --> 01:50:19.840]
And Verizon wireless law ahead a lot of good calls today already there's another one for it though and that was one of the better ones

[01:50:21.400 --> 01:50:22.220]
WQ I am

[01:50:23.140 --> 01:50:31.540]
And now the end of niels contractors near and so the listeners will face the final curtain

[01:50:31.540 --> 01:50:35.620]
My listeners he has said it clear

[01:50:35.620 --> 01:50:39.720]

[01:50:56.340 --> 01:50:57.020]
Oh

[01:50:58.160 --> 01:51:06.800]
Regrets niels had a few why but that again to few to mention niel did what he had to do

[01:51:06.800 --> 01:51:17.000]
Kick the competitions ass without exemption are you sure niels planned each chart of course each careful step

[01:51:19.080 --> 01:51:20.040]
Oh

[01:51:20.040 --> 01:51:26.420]
But more much more than this he did it his way

[01:51:26.420 --> 01:51:27.900]
All right yes

[01:51:27.900 --> 01:51:36.000]
There was times I'm sure the listeners knew when niel bit off more than he could show okay

[01:51:36.520 --> 01:51:36.820]
But

[01:51:38.280 --> 01:51:39.120]
Oh

Spill it out

[01:51:47.820 --> 01:51:48.340]
He faced

[01:51:48.340 --> 01:51:49.120]
Oh

[01:51:49.820 --> 01:51:51.560]
And he stood tall

[01:51:52.640 --> 01:51:53.480]
And

[01:51:53.480 --> 01:51:53.680]
And

[01:51:53.680 --> 01:51:53.840]
And

[01:51:53.840 --> 01:51:54.020]
And

[01:51:54.020 --> 01:51:54.100]
And

[01:51:54.100 --> 01:51:54.560]
And

[01:51:55.940 --> 01:51:56.780]
And

[01:51:56.780 --> 01:51:56.800]
And

[01:51:56.800 --> 01:51:56.800]

[01:51:56.800 --> 01:51:56.980]
And

[01:51:56.980 --> 01:51:56.980]

[01:51:56.980 --> 01:51:56.980]

[01:51:56.980 --> 01:51:56.980]

[01:51:56.980 --> 01:51:56.980]

[01:52:00.320 --> 01:52:01.160]
What

[01:52:01.160 --> 01:52:01.360]
What

[01:52:05.380 --> 01:52:06.220]
That's

[01:52:07.920 --> 01:52:09.920]
I'm not looking

[01:52:10.980 --> 01:52:22.400]
Now as we see him go out damn set up, we found it all was so of using to think he did that all that

[01:52:22.400 --> 01:52:33.680]
And me I say not in a shy way. Oh, no, oh, no, not Neil. He did his way.

Take off those jacket pants.

[01:55:59.240 --> 01:56:04.540]
I'm going to have some real short segments here. We got that damn ballgame coming up in

[01:56:04.540 --> 01:56:10.740]
like 19 and a half minutes. And yeah, just about. And how many spots we got again between

[01:56:10.740 --> 01:56:14.560]
now and 10 of? About 30, man.

[01:56:15.500 --> 01:56:19.840]
W-A-T-Q-I-M. Hello? Yes, sir. Neil. Yes.

[01:56:20.340 --> 01:56:25.600]
Damn, Neil. It was that guy who I was at, that was incredible, wasn't it? Oh, God.

[01:56:25.600 --> 01:56:28.940]
In fact, that's why I'm backed up so bad. Now the serenade went on for about seven and a

[01:56:28.940 --> 01:56:33.200]
half minutes, but it was great. Now, Neil, I just started tuning in now, Neil, when this

[01:56:33.200 --> 01:56:37.460]
guy started singing that, now what's the story with you now? What's the deal with you?

[01:56:37.740 --> 01:56:45.740]
You really leave it now? Am I leaving now? Well, about 19 minutes. He's just getting

[01:56:45.740 --> 01:56:48.300]
ready for about three and a half years down the road. He's preparing for it.

[01:56:49.720 --> 01:56:53.200]
Well, Neil, whatever you do, I'll always miss you, Neil, if I never hear your voice again.

[01:56:53.200 --> 01:56:57.740]
Okay. Okay, thanks. Maybe I'll just poke on you today. Okay, that's the takes here,

[01:56:57.800 --> 01:57:01.620]
that segment. Well, no, seriously, it's my fault, but again, I had it all planned out

[01:57:01.620 --> 01:57:04.880]
in my mind, but I was sure that it wasn't. I wasn't going to cut that serenade off because

[01:57:04.880 --> 01:57:08.480]
he did such a magnificent job. And every time you thought he was done, you know,

[01:57:08.640 --> 01:57:15.000]
scored, scored. He just kept moving right along. 1132 at 560 W-Q-I-M. How I'll tell you

[01:58:26.760 --> 01:58:32.700]
Line and local, we're sports radio 560, UA, UAM.

[01:59:02.700 --> 01:59:15.820]
He's a queer, a wolf, means and proof and a promising queen with letting his shoes

[01:59:15.820 --> 01:59:28.540]
fall and confused, self-hating, Jew, who wears fancy, underneath his shoes.

[01:59:28.540 --> 01:59:37.720]
There is a meerkung, very so he's got to get married.

[01:59:38.220 --> 01:59:51.820]
There is a fairy and he's got to get married. Self-hating, homo, now he's got to get married.

[01:59:51.820 --> 02:00:08.740]
He's both skin of the white house homo. He's a fan of Tagutish, smoke with a glow of dawn,

[02:00:09.480 --> 02:00:20.860]
of Thomas Brown. That's what he stole for. That's he drunk on and he never.

[02:00:20.860 --> 02:00:33.180]
He's tuned on our road. There is a screaming, lifting, very so he's got to get married.

[02:00:35.060 --> 02:00:47.640]
There is a fairy and he's got to get married. Self-hating, homo, but he's got to get married.

[02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:02.400]
So come to find out that we're Jeff Heiss, neighbor Dave, okay, who I do that tremendous

[02:01:02.400 --> 02:01:06.360]
serenade, goes to prove not everybody's all bad, you know, by the way Dave.

[02:01:06.540 --> 02:01:07.380]
Hi, I'm Tally.

[02:01:07.920 --> 02:01:12.440]
And the number two, the beast weighed in and the bad news is no change, 227, no change.

[02:01:13.140 --> 02:01:16.740]
But he admitted that they took him out to some, I don't know, some place, some joint.

[02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:18.720]
Yeah, gotsby's.

[02:01:18.840 --> 02:01:19.800]
And he smoked it and he got hungry.

[02:01:20.120 --> 02:01:22.880]
No, I'm not talking about that. He was in another one. Some crew, some crab.

[02:01:23.080 --> 02:01:26.080]
But no more excuses actually. Now that I'm back here, okay, beast.

[02:01:26.360 --> 02:01:29.620]
If that's gave us a down next week, we're going to put his ass back on emotional.

[02:01:29.820 --> 02:01:31.680]
How do you like that for punishment? How fate worse than death.

[02:01:33.100 --> 02:01:37.840]
I again apologize for the format here in his last hour, but this is all, you know,

[02:01:37.840 --> 02:01:39.700]
that's the same clearance he's not here today anyway.

[02:01:40.980 --> 02:01:42.160]
Right? Right.

[02:01:42.720 --> 02:01:45.300]
The log is like all backed up like a cheap toy fault.

[02:01:45.940 --> 02:01:48.100]
It's clearance is fault. And of course, don't mess with me.

[02:01:48.340 --> 02:01:49.600]
No, she told me that's his fault.

[02:01:50.200 --> 02:01:52.820]
Oh, yes, she, WQAM.

[02:01:53.400 --> 02:01:54.440]
Hi, I'd like to speak to Neil.

[02:01:54.580 --> 02:01:54.860]
Speaking.

[02:01:55.160 --> 02:01:58.440]
Hi, Neil. Listen, you need to stop talking when I'm trying to call.

[02:01:59.460 --> 02:02:00.580]
You're like, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

[02:02:00.600 --> 02:02:01.260]
Yeah, you're right.

[02:02:02.720 --> 02:02:04.900]
I'm just giving me the highest sign. Let me know when that is.

[02:02:04.900 --> 02:02:05.440]
Listen.

[02:02:09.440 --> 02:02:10.240]
Go ahead.

[02:02:10.880 --> 02:02:13.560]
I need you, I need you to move in with me.

[02:02:13.760 --> 02:02:13.900]
No.

[02:02:14.060 --> 02:02:15.220]
Until this war is over.

[02:02:15.420 --> 02:02:20.000]
So, so you can, you know, impart some intelligence on this man that I'm married to.

[02:02:20.120 --> 02:02:20.360]
Yeah.

[02:02:20.540 --> 02:02:25.320]
That if this marriage survive this war, we'll be able to survive anything because we're

[02:02:25.320 --> 02:02:28.000]
on to completely opposite sides of the spectrum.

[02:02:28.100 --> 02:02:29.140]
I heard a rumor about him.

[02:02:29.300 --> 02:02:30.040]
He's an asshole.

[02:02:30.320 --> 02:02:30.760]
That's what I heard.

[02:02:30.920 --> 02:02:31.060]
Exactly.

[02:02:31.700 --> 02:02:33.160]
And I tell him every day.

[02:02:34.460 --> 02:02:39.620]
But what's so sad is that basically the majority of your listeners are on your side.

[02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:40.000]

[02:02:40.320 --> 02:02:44.980]
And so it's kind of like you're preaching to the choir because all the assholes are listening to rush

[02:02:45.420 --> 02:02:46.420]
and then shnit.

[02:02:46.560 --> 02:02:49.680]
Nobody, listen, I mean everybody, they're preaching to their own choir too,

[02:02:49.780 --> 02:02:51.660]
but the fact of the matter is somebody's got to say it.

[02:02:51.900 --> 02:02:54.600]
I'm not sitting here now even up to believe I'm going to change the world

[02:02:54.600 --> 02:02:56.980]
or change any 10 block radius in South Florida.

[02:02:57.360 --> 02:03:00.300]
But you know, at least we're spouting it out there and people can digest it

[02:03:00.300 --> 02:03:01.540]
or puket or whatever they want with it.

[02:03:01.600 --> 02:03:02.220]
It's got to be said.

[02:03:02.220 --> 02:03:02.980]
I love it.

[02:03:03.080 --> 02:03:03.320]
I love it.

[02:03:03.320 --> 02:03:03.340]
I love it.

[02:03:03.340 --> 02:03:04.800]
You can't I'll be like a bunch of minor birds.

[02:03:05.020 --> 02:03:09.860]
Yeah, he can turn it around to make me, you know, sound like I'm an idiot because I kind of,

[02:03:09.860 --> 02:03:15.000]
you know, I think like you and when I listen to you, you just kind of just telling one very simple thing.

[02:03:16.360 --> 02:03:19.860]
Sodom Hussein and the Iraqis did not invade this country.

[02:03:19.980 --> 02:03:20.680]
They were not respite.

[02:03:20.780 --> 02:03:21.780]
Nothing to do with 9-11.

[02:03:22.040 --> 02:03:23.400]
That's the end of the discussion.

[02:03:23.540 --> 02:03:24.840]
There doesn't need to be anything else said.

[02:03:24.920 --> 02:03:27.160]
And nobody in Iraq has asked for help.

[02:03:27.320 --> 02:03:27.500]
Right.

[02:03:27.680 --> 02:03:28.060]
That's correct.

[02:03:28.200 --> 02:03:29.080]
Why are we there?

[02:03:29.080 --> 02:03:32.600]
I'm not I'm not getting the whole thing and you know, I'm a little part of it.

[02:03:32.600 --> 02:03:35.100]
Because it's part of it's part of our master plan.

[02:03:35.100 --> 02:03:37.280]
Yeah, I'm a liberal idiot according to him.

[02:03:37.400 --> 02:03:38.240]
Yeah, he loves you.

[02:03:38.280 --> 02:03:41.680]
And I'm like, oh, so you're telling me I would cut him off real fast fast.

[02:03:41.840 --> 02:03:42.860]
And you can say answer mama.

[02:03:43.140 --> 02:03:44.180]
Anyways, I love it.

[02:03:44.240 --> 02:03:49.340]
Keep it up because you you you know, you're just tell it like the majority of us feel.

[02:03:49.540 --> 02:03:49.740]
Thanks.

[02:03:49.760 --> 02:03:50.740]
We don't so have a weekend.

[02:03:50.740 --> 02:03:51.840]
You too, by the way.

[02:03:51.840 --> 02:03:52.380]
See, there you go.

[02:03:52.420 --> 02:03:54.140]
She's upset because she's got some bozo there.

[02:03:54.140 --> 02:03:55.540]
But he's probably, you know, hung like a mooser.

[02:03:55.540 --> 02:03:57.120]
Maybe, you know, maybe he looks pretty good.

[02:03:57.300 --> 02:03:58.020]
Maybe he pays the bills.

[02:03:58.020 --> 02:03:59.020]
And maybe he pays the bills.

[02:03:59.160 --> 02:04:00.380]
Maybe he's got a lot of money like the beast.

[02:04:00.460 --> 02:04:01.940]
The beast comes from big money, by the way.

[02:04:02.540 --> 02:04:05.680]
So next time we do one of those contest, she was not too bad.

[02:04:05.780 --> 02:04:08.260]
That young lady that he wound up with that day with the beast.

[02:04:08.420 --> 02:04:08.820]
Yeah, he was better than he was.

[02:04:08.820 --> 02:04:09.560]
Here we worry.

[02:04:09.640 --> 02:04:10.920]
We have little faith in all.

[02:04:11.060 --> 02:04:12.540]
Hey, we're never going to him a date.

[02:04:12.800 --> 02:04:14.080]
Hey, we were largely responsible.

[02:04:14.240 --> 02:04:15.180]
At least that's my story.

[02:04:15.360 --> 02:04:16.300]
He owes us big time.

[02:04:16.500 --> 02:04:17.780]
Maybe you'll share some of that great childhood.

[02:04:18.020 --> 02:04:19.100]
Not me, not this kid.

[02:04:19.120 --> 02:04:19.840]
I might eat in this country.

[02:04:19.980 --> 02:04:21.940]
You know, this ain't going to be no food in here while I'm here.

[02:04:21.980 --> 02:04:22.400]
Got your sack?

[02:04:22.580 --> 02:04:24.160]
No, huh, starting tomorrow.

[02:04:24.800 --> 02:04:25.160]
They bring him.

[02:04:25.160 --> 02:04:27.100]
In fact, there's the amenities right up there to let me forget.

[02:04:27.280 --> 02:04:27.600]
Don't forget.

[02:04:27.880 --> 02:04:29.320]
Don't forget to take a break.

[02:04:29.660 --> 02:04:30.700]
I'm going to do that right now.

[02:04:31.200 --> 02:04:33.260]
Boxed ourselves in a corner here, but that's okay,

[02:04:33.260 --> 02:04:34.960]
because Dave, the serenader there,

[02:04:35.080 --> 02:04:36.080]
it was worth the price.

[02:04:36.520 --> 02:04:37.320]
And it killed some great time.

[02:04:37.740 --> 02:04:39.720]
18 till noon at 5.60 WDQ.

[02:04:39.720 --> 02:04:41.520]
I'm still reluctant about ordering a bet over the phone.

[02:04:41.660 --> 02:04:42.120]
Don't be.

[02:04:42.400 --> 02:04:43.640]
It's the smart thing to do.

[02:04:43.700 --> 02:04:44.060]
Be smart.

[02:04:44.180 --> 02:04:44.780]
Not like Frado.

[02:04:45.160 --> 02:04:45.560]
Be smart.

[02:04:45.900 --> 02:04:46.940]
Pick up the instrument and call.

[02:04:47.300 --> 02:04:48.000]
1-800-MAC.

[02:04:48.060 --> 02:04:49.680]
Chris over a million people have done it, including me.

[02:04:49.900 --> 02:04:52.560]
And a lot of us, 1-800-MAT-T-R-E-S.

[02:04:52.620 --> 02:04:53.260]
That's all you have to do.

[02:04:53.260 --> 02:04:55.760]
You'll be talking to somebody that really knows their betting stuff inside and out.

[02:04:56.120 --> 02:04:58.340]
And you can choose from the top manufacturers in the world.

[02:04:58.520 --> 02:04:59.920]
Cele, Sir, Listen, and King Coral,

[02:05:00.180 --> 02:05:01.400]
Donald McTrish, Kerry is only the best.

[02:05:01.460 --> 02:05:03.320]
And once everyone you're looking for, they got it in the stock ready

[02:05:03.320 --> 02:05:05.340]
for just about immediate delivery.

[02:05:05.480 --> 02:05:06.740]
Every size and style of the sun.

[02:05:07.180 --> 02:05:09.020]
Donald McTrish is ranked number one in customer satisfaction.

[02:05:09.540 --> 02:05:11.880]
They got more repeat and referral customers than anybody in the universe

[02:05:11.880 --> 02:05:13.820]
because they know how to treat their customers right.

[02:05:14.180 --> 02:05:16.260]
Once you buy from Donald McTrish just the first time,

[02:05:16.500 --> 02:05:18.880]
you'll never dream of going back and wasting your time on a sure way

[02:05:18.880 --> 02:05:20.440]
that they can go to the department store again.

[02:05:20.700 --> 02:05:22.780]
And don't forget, when you do buy the mattress from Donald McTrish,

[02:05:22.780 --> 02:05:26.280]
they set up the brand new one and take away your crappy old soil betting for free.

[02:05:26.600 --> 02:05:28.460]
You heard me right, Donald McTrish sets up the new one,

[02:05:28.560 --> 02:05:30.020]
takes away the old betting for free.

[02:05:30.340 --> 02:05:32.560]
So make the call right now and into our great night's sleep tonight.

[02:05:32.780 --> 02:05:35.180]
Next Sookas and for years to come from Donald McTrish.

[02:05:35.280 --> 02:05:37.140]
1-800-MAT-T-R-E-S.

[02:05:37.440 --> 02:05:38.480]
That's 1-800-MAT-T-R-E-S.

[02:05:38.580 --> 02:05:41.440]
Be sure and tell him that Neil and Fat Boy and Neighbor Dave turned into C.

[02:05:41.560 --> 02:05:43.420]
My, My, And Look All.

[02:05:43.860 --> 02:05:45.580]
This is 4-T-L-5-60.

[02:05:46.540 --> 02:05:47.760]
Way, Way, Yeah.

[02:05:49.120 --> 02:05:54.180]
Yep, tonight on inside the behind the true Hollywood celebrity music biography profile story,

[02:05:54.180 --> 02:05:57.520]
we take a good heart and stiff look and to start him.

[02:05:57.900 --> 02:06:00.840]
He sang a stirring bow that called holding back the years,

[02:06:01.260 --> 02:06:05.840]
which was about, uh, I have no f***ing idea.

[02:06:06.720 --> 02:06:08.220]
He was simply ready.

[02:06:08.260 --> 02:06:09.120]
Holdin' back.

[02:06:10.740 --> 02:06:12.720]
His voice was beautiful.

[02:06:13.440 --> 02:06:15.960]
But how do you hold back years anyway?

[02:06:15.960 --> 02:06:19.740]
Gavin Pitcher is one of those guys from some half-assed entertainment magazine

[02:06:19.740 --> 02:06:23.520]
who ends up being interviewed and we can't find anyone famous to say anything.

[02:06:23.700 --> 02:06:28.560]
And what is that thing where he goes strangled by the wish-nix and beta or whatever?

[02:06:28.620 --> 02:06:31.240]
Bang, bang, bang, always here by me.

[02:06:32.600 --> 02:06:34.840]
But he's just deliberately confusing.

[02:06:35.140 --> 02:06:39.260]
But simply read frontman Nick Hucknell defends his interpretation of the song.

[02:06:39.420 --> 02:06:40.640]
Look, it's very simple.

[02:06:41.020 --> 02:06:44.820]
Holding back the years, thinking of the fear I've had so long,

[02:06:44.820 --> 02:06:48.420]
when somebody hears, listen to the fear that's gone.

[02:06:48.760 --> 02:06:48.960]
Right.

[02:06:49.400 --> 02:06:50.180]
What does that mean?

[02:06:50.580 --> 02:06:51.620]
Uh, well, is it obvious?

[02:06:52.140 --> 02:06:52.580]
It's...

[02:06:52.580 --> 02:06:55.440]
Holdin' back the years, thinking of the years,

[02:06:55.920 --> 02:06:58.620]
or somebody else's, or somebody else's, or someone else's gone.

[02:06:59.080 --> 02:06:59.860]
Now do you see?

[02:07:00.320 --> 02:07:01.840]
Uh, I didn't hear you.

[02:07:01.940 --> 02:07:02.780]
You turned on the blender.

[02:07:03.080 --> 02:07:03.220]
What?

[02:07:03.760 --> 02:07:04.420]
I never mind.

[02:07:04.820 --> 02:07:05.660]
What about when you sing,

[02:07:06.020 --> 02:07:07.740]
chance from the escape from all I've known?

[02:07:08.200 --> 02:07:10.220]
Nothing had the chance to be good and nothing ever could?

[02:07:10.500 --> 02:07:12.540]
Oh come on, is Nick crystal clear that I'm actually saying?

[02:07:12.540 --> 02:07:17.580]
Chance from the escape from all I've known?

[02:07:18.060 --> 02:07:18.940]
Don't you get it?

[02:07:19.100 --> 02:07:21.860]
Hi, who keeps a bloody jackhammer in there, covered?

[02:07:22.440 --> 02:07:26.760]
Simply read, one big hit, dozens of dumbass words.

[02:07:27.280 --> 02:07:30.140]
It's a big juicy, stopping went and look at show business,

[02:07:30.420 --> 02:07:31.820]
tonight on Inside of A Haunt.

[02:07:31.940 --> 02:07:33.060]
It's Jake, I'm a riverbub.

[02:07:33.360 --> 02:07:33.720]
No way.

[02:07:34.140 --> 02:07:38.240]
All right, that's gonna do it pretty much for the rest of the Marvel exhibition.

[02:07:38.240 --> 02:07:40.380]
This game where he explodes coming up, anybody interested?

[02:07:40.500 --> 02:07:40.580]
No.

[02:07:40.740 --> 02:07:42.000]
Any, uh, don't forget.

[02:07:42.620 --> 02:07:43.660]
Opening day on Monday.

[02:07:43.840 --> 02:07:44.260]
Any interest?

[02:07:44.460 --> 02:07:44.560]
No.

[02:07:45.180 --> 02:07:45.900]
530, man.

[02:07:46.400 --> 02:07:47.540]
501 votes on Apple.

[02:07:47.760 --> 02:07:48.280]
What's your take?

[02:07:49.600 --> 02:07:51.040]
On award protesters.

[02:07:52.080 --> 02:07:53.360]
They're exercising their rights.

[02:07:53.660 --> 02:07:54.100]
179.

[02:07:54.260 --> 02:07:55.720]
I support them 100% 127.

[02:07:56.260 --> 02:07:57.700]
There are a bunch of commy-tinkal assholes.

[02:07:57.840 --> 02:07:58.060]
75.

[02:07:59.500 --> 02:08:01.280]
I protest, no Howard David at 67.

[02:08:02.020 --> 02:08:03.840]
I'm one of them 24 protesters that is.

[02:08:04.760 --> 02:08:07.840]
They're bad for SuperRal 17 and they're on patriotic 13.

[02:08:09.140 --> 02:08:11.360]
New York, oh, this is good, took a ride.

[02:08:11.360 --> 02:08:12.300]
The league.

[02:08:13.180 --> 02:08:13.860]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

[02:08:13.860 --> 02:08:14.860]
Running through my pack.

[02:08:15.140 --> 02:08:17.800]
He gave a corner and then bought a small front.

[02:08:18.220 --> 02:08:18.860]
Big Mac.

[02:08:19.340 --> 02:08:19.900]
You be Ellen.

[02:08:20.520 --> 02:08:22.380]
No, yeah, I'm the one who told you.

[02:08:22.840 --> 02:08:23.660]
You be Ellen.

[02:08:24.320 --> 02:08:25.080]
Ellen.

[02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:27.500]
You be Ellen.

[02:08:28.520 --> 02:08:28.760]
Ellen.

[02:08:29.700 --> 02:08:31.200]
You be Ellen.

[02:08:33.280 --> 02:08:34.240]
What's your point?

[02:08:34.580 --> 02:08:37.820]
21 tickets, you be 90 days.

[02:08:38.260 --> 02:08:40.540]
One rose, three, three.

[02:08:40.540 --> 02:08:44.380]
One rose, three, four, three.
