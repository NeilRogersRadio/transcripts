[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.720]
S'rider you questions

[00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:12.700]
They say the things are not quite right on raw street

[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:14.600]
Hello, George

[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:21.360]
The Dallas sinking low and red in the air

[00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.260]
I was rea

[00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.520]
But Alan Reese fans says this whole

[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.220]
I think I've moved since so can you

[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.300]
Cause my portfolio is D-O-A on raw street

[00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.860]
On raw street

[00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:44.900]
I've done a test in all my stocks on raw street

[00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.540]
And stick the money in my stock not raw street

[00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.660]
Not raw street

[00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.960]
My savings will be sick but bad

[00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.240]
I'll stop getting into the best

[00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:08.780]
Because the Dallas ain't going nowhere on raw street

[00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.660]
On raw street

[00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:16.060]
The Dallas ain't going nowhere on raw street

[00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.600]
Hello, D-O-A-M

[00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:17.540]
Hello

[00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.600]
How can I hear that echo now, George?

[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:23.620]
I guess or go ahead

[00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:24.920]
How you doing, Dale? My name's Lance

[00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.520]
And I was wanting to talk to you about your billboards

[00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.280]
I'm in the modeling business and I have a...

[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.640]
Yeah, this is Reverend Jones

[00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:34.300]
I don't know who he is

[00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.660]
Yeah, how we do?

[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.080]
Anyway, nice year from Reverend Jones to get a start on a Friday

[00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.400]
He's in the modeling business

[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.400]
What?

[00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.320]
He couldn't even wait for the open to finish playing

[00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:43.080]
Exactly

[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.960]
Well, he wanted to like segway off since most obviously

[00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.260]
So whipped up about the billboards

[00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:48.660]
And makes it into this thing like

[00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.260]
Well, I'm bozo, don't you understand?

[00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.040]
You're audience already listening!

[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.780]
We know that

[00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.080]
We're giving the people who are already listening

[00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.400]
a little heads up on where they are

[00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.620]
Because, you know, they like the show

[00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.160]
And of course you'd probably be talking about where yours is

[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.060]
to except that most of the people don't like your show

[00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.940]
And you only got one anyway, one small one

[00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:04.620]
And a billboard

[00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.460]
With no lights on it

[00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:07.960]
Right, with no lights on it

[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.480]
Because George and Viener Boy are up there with the ladders

[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:12.180]
turning the light, poking the lights out with their shift

[00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.740]
But he went through that whole herniatic thing

[00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:16.460]
numerous times

[00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.760]
Then again at the end of the show I thought he was going to bust a gut

[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.060]
Who's going to like pop on right there at the end of the show

[00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.020]
It's funny every other time he does it

[00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.920]
In addition to which doesn't he always tell us he doesn't listen to the show?

[00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.680]
And you saw how does he know I'm talking about the billboard locations

[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.560]
We even plug where his billboard was too

[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.160]
Which I noticed there's he don't care about that

[00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.680]
See it's the idea that the people who are already listening

[00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.720]
They're curious they want to see what they look like

[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.400]
It's not a question that we don't understand

[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.660]
That they're already listening

[00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:41.380]
We do know that

[00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.080]
Mo, I understand you're lot sharper than we are

[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.860]
Okay, lot sharper than our Gensu knives

[00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.480]
We understand that, Chmendrick

[00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.620]
But the fact of the matter is that we like to tell our people

[00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.820]
Because they they want to see in addition to which my face is on here

[00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.500]
Because it's like that's my face

[00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.120]
That's why we're on radio

[00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.880]
And another is Don I miss beautiful

[00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:58.120]
No

[00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.340]
Is Howard Stern lovely?

[00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.600]
No

[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.860]
Whoever said that people on radio had faces for outside

[00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.720]
But that doesn't mean if you have a Howard Stern billboard

[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:05.980]
His picture might not be on it

[00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.700]
Or Don I miss who looks like a dead man

[00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.300]
Or me who looks like whatever I look like

[00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.100]
Who cares?

[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.460]
See because we're not vain

[00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:13.780]
We're not trying to project something

[00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.800]
Some phony image that some people do

[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.100]
I'm not going to mention no names, you know

[00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.800]
I can't stop!

[00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.260]
I know I can't help yourself

[00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.520]
It's your thing

[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:21.320]
It's you

[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.600]
And speaking of him, speaking of Mo

[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.740]
If you go to the website right now or anytime

[00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:27.640]
You get a chance but right now it'll be a good time

[00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:28.780]
Get a good chuckle

[00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.260]
Anybody hasn't seen it?

[00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:31.960]
Go to theoranges.com right now

[00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.040]
It's scrolled on under the pool

[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.160]
Which by the way, the Howard Stern people messed with our pool

[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.380]
Right at the end, did you see that?

[00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:37.140]
Yeah, I'm love

[00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:38.020]
They didn't fool us

[00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.940]
Mad Dog wanted

[00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:39.880]
All right

[00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.800]
But at any rate, underneath the a pool result word

[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.400]
Since features you'll see the lovely Troy Stratford

[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.700]
Formerly number 23 Mimeo Dolphin running back

[00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:48.860]
We used to be a good guy

[00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.660]
And he's got the stolen Mo

[00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.640]
Howard David and weekend hair piece on there

[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:54.040]
Look at that

[00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.800]
And it's hopping up and down

[00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:57.080]
It's the old up

[00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.400]
And down all over Troy's head

[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.440]
That's a beautiful thing

[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.720]
We picked up the spare hair

[00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.680]
In fact, that was the piece that was going to be

[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.060]
If we had most picture on a billboard

[00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:09.640]
That was the piece that we're going to have on there

[00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.340]
But that's what we couldn't put the picture

[00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.060]
We lost the piece as the billboard changes

[00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.560]
Troy intercepted it

[00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.160]
So here's the addresses of the billboard

[00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:22.040]
It's just amazing to me how whipped up to a frenzy here's about that

[00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.800]
Which I guess what he's really parked off about is the fact that we got what?

[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.360]
4.5 and he's got that one little dinky billboard

[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.280]
Well, that shows what they think he emote

[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.800]
Which ain't much

[00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:31.640]
It ain't much

[00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.480]
And you don't know why?

[00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.240]
If there's a buck, I smell it

[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.980]
That's the problem

[00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:38.920]
You got your nose up the wrong answers

[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:07.660]
Anyway, 1562 votes allegedly on yesterday's poll

[00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:08.900]
While PD Lenny was in there, hawk on a china

[00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.660]
I promoted the show RUHOT on ABC

[00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:14.140]
There was a full page ad and some whatever for it

[00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:15.740]
And I was promoting a crap out of it

[00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:16.740]
I saw it, you didn't

[00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.760]
And you saw it and you said, ah, the show blows

[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.520]
And I was there because I asked you how it was

[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.040]
They had a week bunch of people and they had a week bunch the first week

[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.520]
You could spell it with two E's with an E-A-K

[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:28.320]
How it was weak

[00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:29.320]
And you loved the frenzy

[00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:30.040]
And I watched it

[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.820]
It's got nothing to do with Lorenzo

[00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:33.380]
I don't really care who the judges are

[00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:36.700]
That's just a meaningless

[00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:40.420]
Nobody watches that show to show to see who the judges are

[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.180]
All of Lorenzo looked like he used to some of us might

[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:46.560]
What is this saying?

[00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:47.360]
What is this?

[00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:52.040]
Neil, Wayne Wright, three time winner of the triple crown in the 30 to 40's died

[00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:54.260]
Wayne Wright?

[00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:55.140]
What does that mean?

[00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:56.040]
I don't know, I thought it means something

[00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:57.860]
In the 30's to in 40's?

[00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.340]
Oh my god, from Rickle must be 120 years old

[00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:02.160]
Thank you, Rick, for the assimilating information

[00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:05.040]
Anyway, we'll get back to RUHOT

[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:09.000]
Which inspired me for our poll day we got a great poll about the reality TV shows

[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.580]
Which I didn't realize there were like 6,000 of them

[00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:16.020]
Anyway, yesterday we asked our very growing poll man

[00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:17.080]
The popularity is incredible

[00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:17.720]
What do we up to?

[00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:20.800]
45,000 votes now since they looked away?

[00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:24.220]
Yes

[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.420]
They're just going wild

[00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:28.420]
Look at that, are you checking those numbers?

[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:28.800]
Yeah

[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:32.060]
It was like 1400 in some odd when PD Lenny came in

[00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:33.020]
Now let us enter 1600

[00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:37.600]
Anyway, one of the last number before I printed this out was 1562 votes

[00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:41.120]
Howard Stern 295, Mad Dog 291, which we know

[00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:44.920]
It was bogus to Howard Stern people are pumping them in like crazy

[00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:46.960]
Now it's part of that ego thing again, you know?

[00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:49.240]
It is what it is, just accepted

[00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:53.000]
Mad Dog, more people listen to Mad Dog who listen to this show than anybody else

[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.600]
Howard Stern was a very strong second, it was a good horse race

[00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:58.400]
Phil Henry had 176, he was third

[00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:58.960]
Are you sure?

[00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:01.840]
Fat Rush Limbaugh had 155

[00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:07.620]
Schmidt had 130 and of course a lot of those, especially the Schmidt votes yesterday were phony

[00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:09.920]
They were also pouring in like in clumps and clusters

[00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:12.520]
The hopper had 116

[00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:17.400]
Mike Goldberg, Randy Rhodes, 104, which I'm still

[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:18.760]
Do you really believe that?

[00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:19.860]
Yeah

[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.900]
You kept saying that all day yesterday, I believe it

[00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:25.620]
Veda, Veda, Veda

[00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:29.020]
Just the sound of that just makes me

[00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:31.660]
Bob and Tom, it was all small potatoes after that

[00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:38.720]
Bob and Tom had 52, Paul and Old Ron on Zeta 44, Joe and Mark had 30, even beating out Mohawar David

[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:42.500]
They're on and like in a wee hours in the morning when nobody's awake and they still had more votes

[00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:46.660]
For people listen to them than Mohawar David, they have 30, he had 28

[00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:49.480]
Pretty weak, Mo, no wonder he's so belligerent

[00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:54.200]
Pozo, Romy had 23

[00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:58.400]
I think he still pissed off about the Doreen business

[00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:01.020]
You know what I mean?

[00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:03.100]
No, explain it

[00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:06.980]
I think he's really got a big buck up his old smelly

[00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:11.360]
Right, Tom got a buck up his ass man, a big, it's crawling around in there, it's grabbing him nuts

[00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:15.640]
See that opens up the Pandora's box for some more homophobic comments, he can make on Monday

[00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:16.760]
Takes of notes, Mo

[00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:19.900]
That's his main thing

[00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:24.160]
Anti-women, anti-fags, that's basically the whole thing on your show now

[00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:29.760]
In fact, wouldn't surprise me if we have a whole bunch of women's and gay organizations go after his ass now

[00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:30.600]
What about the Dikes?

[00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:33.060]
What did I just say, gay organizations

[00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:34.800]
Mohawar David had 28

[00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:38.240]
This poll yesterday, other than the O.W. radio personality, he'd listen to most

[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:40.140]
A gym rome, Romy had 23

[00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:45.760]
Steve Cain's 16, Jeff the Forest 14 was the late edition DFO with his 85 billboards

[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:48.580]
By the way, today we'll be telling you where all of DFO's billboards are too

[00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:55.300]
George Nuri, Al Bistuk, Dr. Laura had 13, Rick Shaw had 11, Ricky Tickey

[00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:59.320]
Tom joiner, the flyjock had 9, Ed Kaplan at 8

[00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:05.620]
Joyce Kaufman 6, Joe Rose had 6, the big lip band had 5, and Fuddy had 3

[00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:10.420]
That's because we don't have his little kids to listen to his show, they don't listen over here on AM

[00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:12.160]
And certainly not on the stations

[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:18.840]
Eddie, not the chronic asshole, Faxir says the new fashion of freedom this and freedom that is opposed to French

[00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:24.340]
This and French that only further solidifies these stupidity of Americans because the funny thing is they actually are

[00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:27.880]
Flemish fries, Lom's of freedom, Lom's of freedom which are Belgian

[00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:29.920]
It was the Belgians who invented French fries

[00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:31.360]
The other word they stand on this issue

[00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:34.000]
Between the rock and hard and the Iran

[00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:38.220]
It was the illiterate of the Western hemisphere who decided they were French fries to begin with

[00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:42.880]
Love you tons, thanks for continuing to try on this shallow-minded Quagmars' Eddie, another Eddie not the chronic

[00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:45.320]
Thank you Eddie not the chronic, thank you very much

[00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:51.960]
And the Belgians invented, so if we have to do this, if these people are compelled to show their childishness to the world

[00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:55.360]
Why can't we just call them fries? Don't we anyway?

[00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:56.000]
Pretty nice

[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.900]
But fries with that? Nobody says you want French fries with that?

[00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:00.260]
Nobody says that

[00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:01.020]
That large fries call

[00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:06.580]
Nobody goes into a drive through a burglar king and says, oh give me a big Mac or whatever the hell it is

[00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:09.360]
What they say? What's burglar king?

[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.680]
Give me a wapper and order a large French fry

[00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:15.360]
Anybody say that? No, of course not

[00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:20.680]
But there are some people who just have to make a big cemissata everything just to make their point

[00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:22.080]
Where hey you French fasters

[00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:24.240]
And we do hit the French but for different reasons

[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:24.560]
Sure

[00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:26.440]
We always hit the French, at least we're consistent

[00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:28.180]
Oh look at this, or Elizabeth's or a deal

[00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:30.360]
Oh Elizabeth's heart is home safe by the way

[00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:30.600]
Oh!

[00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:33.840]
And we got more of her relatives on there all over the place

[00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:39.160]
Or police say she suffered psychological damage, isn't that shocking? Aren't you surprised?

[00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:39.360]
Yeah, I think

[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.000]
Aren't you surprised?

[00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:41.540]
Wow

[00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:44.660]
Boy, again I don't want to make light of it but it's just...

[00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:50.020]
And then last night, the sweet and a bad hair piece is Aaron Brown with a really bad red hair piece on there

[00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:51.360]
Looks like a beaver dot on his head

[00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:56.400]
He's going through his little speech, he has like a little monologue he goes through 10 o'clock every night

[00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:01.800]
And about well, we don't apologize for the coverage here because nothing has really changed in the UN or on the war front

[00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:05.300]
And blah blah blah blah and this is a feel good story about how we fondleism

[00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:09.320]
You know, he's trying to rationalize the fact that the media are in a feeding frenzy over this story

[00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:11.300]
And just beating it into the ground like they do with everything else

[00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:16.620]
On and on and on and over and over until you got Elizabeth's smart coming out of every orifice in your body

[00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:16.800]
Correct

[00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:18.420]
And I'm saying enough is enough already

[00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:23.660]
Well, when you get a little more information about these scumbags that kidnapped her

[00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:28.460]
And when you decide what time and what channel they're going to upload their brains out on national TV

[00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:30.500]
Then let us know that we'd like to hear that

[00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:35.980]
But other than that, I think we've heard more than enough from all these relatives

[00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:41.260]
And this is another thing that's disturbing to me is that all the friends and relatives every time one of these things comes along

[00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:46.020]
They just can't get enough coverage, they can't be on enough networks, they can't be on enough to thank everybody

[00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:49.820]
After the first 500 times it gets to be a little bit ponderous, you know what I'm saying?

[00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:51.120]
Yeah, I know what you're saying

[00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:54.160]
The uncles, you know, the uncles, they want their 15 seconds of fame

[00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:57.540]
Anyway, I don't care what George said

[00:11:58.120 --> 00:11:58.980]
Are you hot?

[00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:00.220]
Was really hot last night

[00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:02.520]
It's a great show and now they're finally catching on and finally again

[00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:04.740]
Oh, but that's just a parade of flesh and I say

[00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:05.180]
Oh, right

[00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:06.960]
Yeah, that's right, that's what we want

[00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:08.340]
Last night was hot

[00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:13.880]
Last night was just fine and was something there for everybody even if you don't like Lorenzo Lama's who cares

[00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:17.380]
913 at 560 WQM

[00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:19.700]
It's getting to be 100 degrees in the shade just about every day

[00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:21.860]
In fact, it's going to warm up here this weekend 50s

[00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:22.520]
Oh, right

[00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:24.540]
But down there like 90s

[00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:28.920]
This turning on a hot stove to cook dinner and that kind of weather turned you off like a lot of people have probably does

[00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:32.560]
Maybe you should start thinking about grilling already even though it's only the middle of March

[00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:37.000]
And for all your barbecue needs, shop at Barbecue's Galore they've got the guaranteed lowest prices in town

[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:43.120]

This is my and local, this is for 205 cities

[00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:45.840]
French people piss me out

[00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:55.500]
The Middle Easters' world will be exploded to dumb at people killed

[00:13:55.500 --> 00:14:02.000]
With the gas that we sold him, first time a crescer nation and the only one that's going

[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:08.220]
Now more blood will be spilled to get that oil flowing, forget about Korea

[00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:17.920]
The nooks they're talking about, we're right we is drilling it over and over and to our head

[00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:24.220]
At Iraq have some, weapons of mass destruction

[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:41.000]
3,000 people killed are now forgotten, let's exploit them instead

[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:54.100]
Hate their oil to be counted, going after sedum too, playing kato sama, there's no longer mention of a name in law this but no one seems concerned all

[00:14:54.100 --> 00:15:05.980]
Humvee and complacent believe in every word of this cartel in administration that controls us by fear through leading a manipulation and the right wing

[00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:17.500]
Is drilling it over and over and to our heads that are at asylum, weapons of mass destruction

[00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:36.380]
The loss of civil rights is a price that we're paying, we're all suspects now, not the ass drop is saying

[00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:48.100]
I have nothing to hide, tables, hawkers all are saying, blind obedient cattle don't have any reservation, louder provoked, battle, and world annihilation

[00:15:48.100 --> 00:16:05.100]
Old regime must fall, it's had a virgin insult with no objection at all, then the crack don't have a fault and a right wing is drilling it over and over and to our parade watch this

[00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:18.680]
I have some weapons of mass destruction, here only I have some weapons of mass destruction

[00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:22.620]
Great news for George War starts Tuesday

[00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:27.480]
Are you lucky? You know I was thinking about something, what's that?

[00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:36.580]
What's ordinarily when there's anything going on in the world, our station might be one of the last that anybody would tune into unless it's a ball game or some kind of a golf tournament or some crap like that, like a sports emergency

[00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:43.640]
But sports, that's a great lie, we ought to have a sounder for that

[00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:47.940]
QAM sports emergency

[00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:55.920]
Well but seriously, because thanks to our good friends at the chief channel, there is no more news station, right?

[00:16:56.420 --> 00:17:01.760]
So they're locked into like Dr. Laura and Laura and stuff like that, so nowhere is there any local talk

[00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:05.080]
What's that word?

[00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:08.660]
I said local, I see, that's right, it doesn't go on me

[00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:10.660]
What time is she on anyway? The goddess?

[00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:13.540]
I have no idea

[00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:17.420]
Afternoon, she called Beach, how would I know?

[00:17:17.580 --> 00:17:19.560]
How do we know? Well I'll tell you, ask Peta

[00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:21.520]
Leonard, he might know

[00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:26.260]
Peta, I think she's on the afternoon, but forgetting about that

[00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:30.920]
So the idea is since we have the flexibility, like if something's happening in the world, you just...

[00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:33.040]
The diplomat from one of the other

[00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:35.840]
Thank you Paula, you just open up the pot and there it is

[00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:42.680]
So the moment that the hostility start when you're on ear anyway, you just open it up, pot it up, you're gonna have a big week next week I think

[00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:43.920]
Because the war starts Tuesday

[00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:49.520]
And we'll have lots of food in here so that we can just eat and listen to a big war party

[00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:51.900]
Sounds good to me, I'll bring my war paint

[00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:53.860]
I might come down for it but I doubt it

[00:17:54.620 --> 00:18:00.400]
So here's the poll today, and again I don't care what anybody says, you're entitled to your own opinion, this is a good show

[00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:04.340]
And you know, assholes like Tom Jicke can write, well this is just gratuitous flesh

[00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:08.220]
You know what, that's what the public wants, including me, including George, including Carlos

[00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:09.960]
And probably including Tom, you know

[00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:14.880]
We're not looking for so much intellectual stimulation on TV, maybe once in a while, you know

[00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:16.180]
Right, a flesh parade

[00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:20.060]
Right, a flesh parade, what's wrong with that? That's what the public wants, right?

[00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:22.200]
Right, F&A, T&A, and F&A

[00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:27.980]
So my poll question today, and I didn't realize it was gonna be such a star-spangled banner of so many shows, God

[00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:34.740]
Yeah, because you know the great originality of TV, if there's one, there's a building, if there's one and it's a hit, there's a thousand

[00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:40.100]
Although you notice how fast the Quixote thing peedered out on a kind of its sucked, maybe?

[00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:44.640]
On a kind of the Quixote, as they came up with sucked, and a kind of the fact that they just drove them into the ground

[00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:47.760]
He wants to be a millionaire 15 times a week, and they killed it

[00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:51.380]
Like everything else television touches, they kill it, they butcher it

[00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:55.720]
And that's all they know how to do, they overdo everything like the Elizabeth Smart thing, like the alien stuff

[00:18:55.720 --> 00:19:01.740]
They can't just do it and do it well, if somebody catches on and somebody says, hey, we like that

[00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:03.900]
Oh great, it's like if you had a steak

[00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:07.620]
And you said, when I was a delicious, oh here, have ten more

[00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:10.660]
Well, no, I just only wanted one, no, here have twenty more

[00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:15.080]
And you finally start puking on steak, you finally start up-sucking meat

[00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:18.960]
Anyway, which TV reality showed you like best speaking of meat?

[00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:20.400]
Are you hot?

[00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:24.920]
13 nights on ABC by the way, they had an excellent panel last night

[00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:29.260]
And they were like, I would say, three guys and three chicks, they were like, pretty god damn good

[00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:31.560]
And maybe more than that, I forget, they were good

[00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:35.120]
Huh? I can't remember that one girl's name, didn't we figure it out before the show?

[00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:37.320]
Rachel, yeah, yeah, yeah

[00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:41.780]
See? I know, Rachel and then it was- and I even looked back if you go to their website, are you hot?

[00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:47.640]
They got the contestants from all four or five weeks, whatever that's been on the air, they're all on there

[00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:51.620]
And there's some people that quite frankly, their picture shouldn't be on my billboard

[00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:53.760]
They can have better pictures, not just bigger but like-

[00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:56.340]
Oh, when you looked like that, how could you have your picture on the billboard?

[00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:59.620]
You want people to- yeah, I didn't really bother me, everybody knows what I looked like

[00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:02.040]
And I look- I'm an old, uh, bag, it looks bad

[00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:05.020]
And that's the way it goes, I got a face for radio, doesn't bother me?

[00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:06.060]
I saw it again this morning

[00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:09.120]
See? That's what happens when you're a personality, when you're a celebrity

[00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:13.080]
Is people know what you look like, and to be honest with you, there's a lovely king on CNN right now

[00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:14.300]
They just showed his ugly putt, huh?

[00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:16.960]
Yeah, I'm not even in the same category with him when it comes to ugly

[00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:19.340]
But he don't mind, see what I'm saying?

[00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:20.160]
Mm-hmm

[00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:21.140]
Look there, right?

[00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:26.700]
The Virginian, the gunslinger, the white-erp, uh, gunsmoke, bonanza

[00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:32.620]
I mean, everybody was like, going into lone ranger, the lone stranger, uh, a wild-bill hitchcock

[00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:37.340]
They were all on there, and the same with cops show, the same thing

[00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:41.540]
So TV, if something goes over, man, like, oh, it's a hit, it's a freaking hit

[00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:45.780]
Like Robert Dubell said, it's a big, big fat-titted hit, remember that?

[00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:47.520]
Yes, they do

[00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:48.000]
Yeah

[00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:50.480]
That was Howard Beale, of course

[00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:54.660]
And maybe they could have Howard Beale as one of the, uh, that's right, he's dead

[00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:56.700]
Damn it, see if they just had Peter Fincher round

[00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:59.720]
They could have him on to be one of the judges on, are you hot?

[00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:02.800]
I'm as mad as hell, I'm as good as H.S. anymore

[00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:03.060]
Oh!

[00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:06.540]
In fact, maybe they could just prop his body up there to replace Lorenzo Lama's to make you happy

[00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:08.360]
Since you hate Lorenzo Lama so much

[00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:10.760]
You're just jealous because of how he used to look

[00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:11.640]
Whatever

[00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:13.940]
Look at it this way, he don't look so great anymore

[00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:16.860]
So he got a feel pretty good about that, he's looking worse by the day

[00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:18.660]
What was that movie he was in with all the snakes?

[00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:21.940]
Snake eater, but there was no snakes in it

[00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:22.980]
Well, maybe there was a snake

[00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:25.000]
Yeah, there was, there was, he kept grappling with it

[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.640]
And then he made snake eater too, he's a goofball

[00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:30.300]
But he sure did used to look good

[00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:33.160]
In fact, he could have been on that show as a contestant as a post-opanalyst

[00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:35.700]
But you're right, he's doing the Howard Stern routine

[00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:39.780]
Funny you mentioned that to me this morning, because since I listened to him doing the judging last night, I thought

[00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:41.760]
But he's starting to sound like Howard, you know?

[00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:42.640]
I don't mean our Howard

[00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:46.160]
Cleaning back and trying to be cool and just shut up

[00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:47.100]
I like him

[00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:51.580]
You're okay with my book for Lorenzo, don't hang any crap off his little banana of this guava eaten stick

[00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:54.780]
27 past nine and five sixty WQAM

Hey Mo, are you hot?

[00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:00.880]
No

[00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:04.320]
I'm the type of place that's really hot that's Emil Coach Chinese buffet

[00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:08.400]
In fact, whether you're lovely, whether you're ugly, whether you're slim, whether you're a gigantic tub

[00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:12.120]
And of course, at all buffet is you'll see some people you'll think, what are they doing at a buffet?

[00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:14.440]
Why are they just, well that's how they got like that?

[00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:15.840]
Practice makes perfect

[00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:20.680]
Three locations of the great Emil Coach Chinese buffet is try him this weekend, go for a feast before the war starts

[00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:23.920]
And then always a good idea to like stir up for the famine?

[00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:24.640]

[00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:27.940]
You'll find him in sunrise, North Miami Beach, in their newest location in Pembroke Pines

Everything is fresh and delicious, nothing sits out there getting moldy and oldy

[00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:35.200]
Six different kinds of soups, they got dozens of succulent entrees

This is 420-560

[00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:52.260]
Way, way, yeah

[00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:54.960]
Feel Roger, God

[00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:02.280]
Tonight, Dolan Clinton

[00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:04.900]
Let me ask you something Bob, what's your wife looking for?

[00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:07.400]
Bob Dol says, what do you mean?

[00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:10.580]
A number of times she makes a speech, she's staring up at the sky

[00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:17.040]
Yeah, let me tell you something that I racked, I ordered 79 bombing missions in Iraq back in 98

[00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:20.920]
But your people put a stop to it, there's a fox ring a bell

[00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:24.100]
But Bob Dol says, you got a blowjob

[00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:30.020]
Yeah, Bob, all your people who fixated with my penis and still are

[00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:31.960]
They'll ignore and slush

[00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:34.300]
Laced I don't need any help from my penis

[00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:36.700]
Bob Dol could always use a hand

[00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:38.440]
Bob, are those garter socks you wear?

[00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:40.600]
My, you want a date? They're not my type

[00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:42.480]
Bob, can you do this?

[00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:45.560]
No, Bob Dol says no

[00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:47.240]
Oh, look at this really fast

[00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:49.160]
Look, look, I'm making a shot of puppets

[00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:50.840]
I'm not even in the same room stupid

[00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:52.100]
I know he can't see me

[00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:53.340]
All the same to me, communist

[00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:55.100]
Yeah, I'm done

[00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:57.100]
You got my check

[00:24:57.920 --> 00:24:59.420]
934 or 560, nobody can see him

[00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:01.160]
Now is that for real online winner? Is that a joke?

[00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:02.780]
Carlos, it's real

[00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:05.600]
It says, Poppano Park, Brian Sears, ho

[00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:08.240]
Hello, I have to get Brian, he's right next to me

[00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:12.260]
I ride around the 11th morning and I've heard you praise Brian Sears

[00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:14.080]
And I said, well I got to wait till I come to his barn

[00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:15.900]
Because he's not usually here in the morning

[00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:16.420]
Right

[00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:19.320]
He's here right now about 10 feet, he was waiting like 5 minutes

[00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:20.920]
Let me just hold him 2 seconds

[00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:21.880]
Here he comes

[00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:23.900]
Brian, here he is, he's on the air

[00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:27.280]
Here he comes, he was standing there while you were doing the whole monologue there

[00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:27.760]
Here he comes

[00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:29.980]
Here this is a man of closest sweetheart

[00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:31.640]
Hello, Neil

[00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:32.480]
Yes sir

[00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:33.900]
Hi, this is Brian Sears

[00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:34.880]
Is it really?

[00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:36.660]
Yeah

[00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:37.320]
This is Brian Sears

[00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:38.800]
Yeah

[00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:43.620]
I just called the lady that I enjoyed your show and thanks for all the things

[00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:45.780]
How long you sticking around Brian?

[00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:48.300]
I'm going to stay down here till the middle of April

[00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:49.220]
Really?

[00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:49.980]
Yeah

[00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:53.080]
Well thanks for being there

[00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:58.000]
Okay, I appreciate your show and you know what the good work

[00:25:58.000 --> 00:25:58.900]
And you too

[00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:01.120]
And no more than 8 in one night, okay Brian?

[00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:01.840]
Okay

[00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:02.860]
That's going to be the limit

[00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:04.240]
All right

[00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:05.300]
Okay, we're all up to it

[00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:07.040]
Okay, I think I don't know if that was for real or not

[00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:07.980]
Do we know if that was for real?

[00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:08.840]
I guess you could have been

[00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:11.080]
Maybe there's Wally Hennessey doing a voice

[00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:12.260]
How's it going, A Wally?

[00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:14.080]
So that takes care of our calls

[00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:16.460]
You had a whole bunch of money for a minute but I guess they ran away

[00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:17.600]
Which is fine with me, you know?

[00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:20.740]
The poll is up, I don't think we're going to get a big response on this poll

[00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:21.380]
You wonder why?

[00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:22.580]
Take a look at what's leading us

[00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:25.400]
We get a quick 40 votes as soon as it goes up

[00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:26.760]
21, they all suck

[00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:28.140]
Well, whatever you like

[00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:32.300]
Yeah, maybe we can all sit around watching Sean Hannity or whatever

[00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:36.060]
And the popular thing to say but the reality of it all is that's very much

[00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:37.900]
Yeah, you want to, I mean nobody's tracing your vote

[00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:40.560]
We don't have your house and check out which ones you're watching

[00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:41.660]
They don't all suck

[00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:45.580]
In fact, if I would have been for RU Hot real world and road rules

[00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:47.760]
They had some plenty of moments on there too

[00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:48.600]
In their time

[00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:51.220]
Real world this season is a whole new level

[00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:52.220]
Is it really?

[00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:53.020]
Well, not for you

[00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:53.860]
Oh

[00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:56.580]
Well, I'm just saying for whatever anybody wants to see

[00:26:56.580 --> 00:26:57.040]
That's all

[00:26:57.040 --> 00:26:59.600]
I mean, is, oh god, you can't be talking about that

[00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:02.080]
I did go out for the intellectuals out there all three of them

[00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:05.140]
I did go out and get the books yesterday that I was looking for

[00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:06.440]
Desperate must have been my lucky day

[00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:09.020]
Perpetual War for Perpetual Peace by Gord Vidal

[00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:11.920]
And the Honey of the President by Joe Coniston and Gene Lyons

[00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:13.880]
Which is a big, thick book

[00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:16.760]
Like almost 400 pages, it's big and it's thick

[00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:17.840]
That's what Bubba said

[00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:22.100]
The Honey of the President, the 10-year campaign to destroy Bill and Hillary Clinton

[00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:25.200]
Excellent book already scanned through it

[00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:29.680]
5,670, 5,60, pound, 5,60 on the AT&T line

[00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:34.120]
8 million mid-time stories from the tabloids today

[00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:37.060]
So if nobody's got any material, that's okay with me

[00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:38.760]
Because we got tons and tons of crap here

[00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:41.640]
Let's see Survivor 5, the Osborne 5

[00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:45.480]
They all suck 29, that's our crowd, sour, your sour folks

[00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:48.640]
Quit being so sour, I know you're stuck there, that's your problem

[00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:49.300]
In your lion

[00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:54.180]
You don't know if they're lying or not, but why are they so glad they're negative on everything?

[00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:55.160]
Oh, you know the answer to that

[00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:57.740]
They're always accusing me, oh it's another one of Niels' negative pulls

[00:27:57.740 --> 00:28:00.320]
Well, this isn't negative, we're asking you, what do you like the best?

[00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:02.120]
That's a positive, do you like anything?

[00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:02.360]
No

[00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:04.740]
Is there anybody that you like, oh, do you like yourself?

[00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:06.160]
I like hate

[00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:11.920]
Real World MTV 3, Fear Factor 2, are you hot, Scott, a pair, and one of those is mine

[00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:14.740]
So 53 votes, small potatoes, nothing

[00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:19.540]
We just have it hit on, of course we didn't put Mohawar David on this poll or how it's turned

[00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:23.120]
So we're just going to get the kind of response that we're looking for

[00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:23.880]
Very sad

[00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:28.880]
So it's appropriate that I'm handing the keys of the king to you for the next week

[00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:32.960]
Because you can see that the tremendous enthusiasm we had from them most of this week

[00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:34.380]
Right down the toilet, you know what I mean?

[00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:35.640]
Well, they're busy

[00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:37.160]
Doing what?

[00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:37.720]
Duck taping

[00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:40.580]
We'll get ready, that's right, duck taping in and that's where I getting ready for Tuesday and war

[00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:41.940]
Here's Miami, hello

[00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:44.600]
Good morning, my baguette friend

[00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:45.660]
Yeah, huh, huh

[00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:49.100]
Thanks, Mo, Mo doing a voice on his way up to Boka

[00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:52.100]
By the way, don't break your neck looking at your thing on a turnpike

[00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:55.780]
Spinning around like Linda Blair trying to get one last peek

[00:28:55.780 --> 00:28:58.740]
Well, he's got to see it in the daytime because you can't see it at night, that billboard

[00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:00.840]
Doesn't have your picture on, Neymar Mo

[00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:06.500]
Troisdrapper told the piece 5,670 and anybody see that thing on our website?

[00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:08.960]
Evidently not, besides us

[00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:12.860]
You would have thought 50,000 people would have been calling just in his hysterics over the Troisdrapper

[00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:15.780]
Bouncy, bouncy, how we're, how we're David, here at the peace on our website

[00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:18.040]
No, nothing, you know, it's out of the floor, I keep forgetting

[00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:19.860]
Keep forgetting where I'm on here

[00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:22.280]
Here's Point and V, chill out

[00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:27.360]
Hey, Neal, I went out and I bought the Michael Moore book

[00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:31.920]
And I bought another one of his books called Downsized This

[00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:33.660]
Right, that was the first one

[00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:34.980]
Yeah, have you read that one?

[00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:35.500]
No

[00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:40.160]
You got to get your hands on that one too, that one's all about corporate America

[00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:48.000]
And it's a lot like this movie Roger and me, you know, about closing down the factories

[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:54.560]
And all of these different things that is, unfortunately, it's written in 96

[00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:57.820]
So a lot of the politics have changed since then

[00:29:57.820 --> 00:30:05.760]
But the policies are still the same within the corporations and the contributions from to the political parties

[00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:07.320]
They're still coming from the same places

[00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:11.220]
So it's still semi-relevant, actual and booked out

[00:30:12.260 --> 00:30:12.780]
Okay

[00:30:12.780 --> 00:30:14.520]
Yeah, give it a read

[00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:15.600]
Okay, thanks

[00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:18.020]
Michael Moore likely to win Oscars a matter of fact

[00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:21.420]
If all the scenarios, plows, is predicted if the US invades are back next week

[00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:27.320]
And Michael Moore wins the best documentary category for bowling for Columbine, the 75th US award ceremony on March 23rd

[00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:28.900]
will be a historically controversial event

[00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:35.020]
Given the intense divisions over the war in the US especially in the anti-war Hollywood community

[00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:38.460]
Win by Morca to clips such historically political years of 72 and 78

[00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:44.200]
In the first case, Marlon Brando sent a model dressed as an Apache woman to reject his best actor award for the Godfather

[00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:50.200]
In a protest on behalf of Native Americans in 1978 a pro-Palestinian Vanessa Redgrave won Best Actress for Julia

[00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:56.360]
And referred to Zionist hoodlums from the stage of the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion where protestors burned her an epigee outside

[00:30:57.440 --> 00:31:02.360]
Moore's angry documentary condemns American culture as paranoid, gun-crazy at home and militaristic abroad

[00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:08.340]
Put him in front of a worldwide audience of a billion you can expect a forceful tirade against President George W and his war plans

[00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:15.600]
It says on the surface bowling for Columbine's Oscar win seems as much as a foregone conclusion as the onset of the bombing and Baghdad

[00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:16.420]
How do you like that?

[00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:20.440]
And of course he couldn't get it filmed in America

[00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:25.180]
He had to come up here to Canada to find people who would film it for him

[00:31:25.180 --> 00:31:27.360]
But we don't want to put that propaganda on you right?

[00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:32.060]
So there you go, it was a great Michael Moore but we don't want to talk about stuff like that

[00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:33.580]
We want to talk about reality shows

[00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:41.480]
They don't, they hate him 54, how many we votes we got? 54 out of 101, almost half say they all suck

[00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:43.280]
They suck, they suck, they suck

[00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:49.540]
Survivor 9, the Osborne's 9 real world MTV 6, are your hots got 5 blind day 3 in American Idol

[00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:52.540]

[00:31:52.820 --> 00:31:54.560]
Got it

[00:31:54.560 --> 00:32:00.660]

[00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:05.640]
Nice gone mad dog, let's think in Joe Rosad one, the Humber doing a short Gulfstream where he'll be in heaven 3 to 650

[00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:12.720]
6 50, it's you and basketball or baseball against Rutgers, Eddie Captain to baseball game and ESPN radio for what it's worth overnight

This is Joe from the morning, with new rockers

[00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:31.740]
This is Suserebro

[00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:35.760]
Tienes preguntas?

[00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:43.380]
It's a terrorist warning

[00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:53.120]
So as you drive on into words, be alert

[00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:58.560]
The White House says we're all doomed now

[00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:01.860]
Can't be sure where they might strike a neck

[00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:05.920]
Yeah, we're nervous, wrecks cause of all of the stress

[00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:09.680]
Rum's feds as we better watch out

[00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:15.100]
He used the word I fear, it's the terrorist warning

[00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:22.680]
The government says we prove it

[00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:24.980]
And I'm scared

[00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:30.260]
They say not if but when now

[00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:33.560]
Not specific threats or a joke

[00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:37.520]
Yeah, I think there are hopes they could give me a stroke

[00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:41.720]
I think that I just will ignore it

[00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:43.080]
Yeah, live my life

[00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:45.040]
Enjoy the ride, live my life

[00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:47.900]
I can't advise terrorists

[00:33:54.460 --> 00:33:57.600]
I'm placed next 560 WQM happy Friday too

[00:33:57.600 --> 00:34:00.780]
Gill and Homestead is becoming beyond chronic on a fax machine

[00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:02.840]
But nevertheless, at least he's responding what I'm talking about

[00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:06.400]
The real world on MTV was the original every season it gets better says Gill

[00:34:07.660 --> 00:34:10.800]
Yeah, he's probably just real from the real world

[00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:18.560]
560-560-050560 on the AT&T in Verizon wireless line

[00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:22.340]
I'll tell PDO to thank you so much for this copy

[00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:26.340]
I'll tell PDO to go on air

[00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:28.260]
What's he leaving?

[00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:30.940]
Before the war starts

[00:34:31.860 --> 00:34:34.180]
Here's Fort Lauderdale, our lonely only call

[00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:35.980]
Hello, Neil

[00:34:35.980 --> 00:34:42.260]
Yes, the crystal burger is on the corner of Verizon

[00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:43.400]
Yeah, we already know, thank you

[00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:45.360]
Sunrise in power line, we already know it's old news

[00:34:46.020 --> 00:34:47.900]
Oh my god

[00:34:48.340 --> 00:34:48.740]
Wooo!

[00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:51.780]
It is a scary, you know what?

[00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:54.640]
Good thing I got a pile of stuff here I could go to midnight

[00:34:54.640 --> 00:34:55.200]
Really?

[00:34:55.740 --> 00:34:58.460]
I could! I got piles, man, don't tease me like that

[00:34:58.460 --> 00:35:04.740]
For example, the oldest human footprints have been found in volcanic ash in Italy

[00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:11.080]
They were made by individuals scrambling down the flanks of an active volcano about 350,000 years ago

[00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:16.000]
Now the Bible says it was only 5,000 years old, so what kind of commie pinko propaganda is this, huh?

[00:35:16.340 --> 00:35:17.620]
Satan put the footprints there

[00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:21.480]
Italian scientists who identified three separate fossilized trackways

[00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:27.140]
say the people that made them walk on two feet using their hands holding the stud of themselves on a difficult descent

[00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:30.920]
Do the oldest footprints to be found of the genus Homo?

[00:35:31.540 --> 00:35:32.360]
Hey, what?

[00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:39.060]
The group that we belong to, the researchers told the BBC, the genus Homo is what they're saying

[00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:40.100]
Gay, am I Homo?

[00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:41.620]
What was it?

[00:35:41.780 --> 00:35:47.100]
Gay, he's obsessed, man, if there's anybody more Homo phobic than Moll, I haven't encountered that person yet

[00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:53.040]
I'm sure we got a few in the audience, which is his crowd, but my god, gay, obsessed, obsessed

[00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:54.860]
And of course you know what they say about those kind of people?

[00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:55.700]
No, what do they say?

[00:35:55.860 --> 00:36:00.200]
The ones that always point to finger, the finger kind of finger kind of like does a boomerang

[00:36:01.820 --> 00:36:06.600]
Commentators say the prints were probably made by Homo, Hydeburg genus

[00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:08.440]
Sounds like nuts, he faggot's today

[00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:15.660]
Hydeburg genus, a 400 in the Andrthols that dominated Europe at this time, and most of what's in South Florida right now at this time, the Andrthols

[00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:22.240]
Paolo Miato and his colleagues from the University of Pato were studying the trackways known to locals as devil's trails

[00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:24.600]
And they say they are particularly detailed

[00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:29.760]
The prints were found in the western margin of Rachamonofina, volcanic complex in southern Italy, and a

[00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:37.560]
Pryoclastic flow they did back between 285 and 225,000 years ago, almost 400,000 years old, they're almost ready to live in some rise

[00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:39.140]
How do you like that?

[00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:49.440]
And yet the religious doubt there, now the Bible says the god created a 5,000 years ago, 5600, whatever the hell it's supposed to be, and anybody who would believe that crap

[00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:51.600]
God, save us from them

[00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:53.460]
Oh God

[00:36:53.460 --> 00:36:58.260]
5,6705, because once I get into this tablet stuff, man, I'm not turning back

[00:36:59.200 --> 00:36:59.800]
Okay

[00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:05.160]
The Josey Lambi thing about Jack O'Tyde of the mob with Alvin Malnick

[00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:12.240]
Justin trades Kelly speaking to Tabloid show of reality shows, Justin Guarini from American Idol

[00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:14.500]
Justin trades Kelly for a guy

[00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:23.280]
Boy stars noisy sex needles neighbors sexy Jennifer Esposito's mating call has a rare apple's neighbors of fuming

[00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:26.780]
Britney's decoy spells trouble, but unless she's got a decoy

[00:37:26.780 --> 00:37:32.120]
So Sydney fears dad's explosions and wants to move OJ daughter trapped in a house of pain

[00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:36.240]
And this is the saddest story of them all, I'm gonna put this right on top of my pile

[00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:38.940]
Remember we had to think a couple days ago about who's gonna cook first?

[00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:39.400]
Yeah

[00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:45.140]
And Jack par didn't get too many votes probably because most of our audiences know enough to remember Jack par just me and Boka Brian

[00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:51.000]
Jack par was far and away the greatest host of the tonight show he really invented

[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:57.080]
I mean Steve Allen and Jerry Lester were before him, but in terms of what it turned into with the guests in the table and the chairs

[00:37:57.080 --> 00:37:58.860]
That was Jack par stirred up that

[00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:00.480]
He was sensational

[00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:02.860]
Jack par silenced by stroke

[00:38:02.860 --> 00:38:03.540]
Oi

[00:38:04.260 --> 00:38:06.660]
Not a good shape 84 and maybe on a way out

[00:38:06.660 --> 00:38:13.040]
You don't care about that because you know from Jack par I still the old the clips when they do the history of television and stuff like weaver

[00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:20.240]
Right, oh he had an incredible guest Alexander King, but at any rate 5 6 7 here's a lady in the Pembroke Pines

[00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:20.540]
Hello

[00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:29.800]
Okay, I thought it said Pembroke Pines we get to make those Morse planes

[00:38:30.260 --> 00:38:31.800]

[00:38:37.580 --> 00:38:42.280]
I've made that note but what I wanted to say is that the thing you need that know?

[00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:43.280]
Yeah

[00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:43.940]
Oh

[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:51.920]
I'm the bits that you're playing are fantastic. I don't know who writes them if it's all Boka Brian or whoever

[00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:53.680]
But you know Moe Howard David writes him

[00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:54.040]
Pardon?

[00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:55.160]
Moe Howard David

[00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:56.340]
No way

[00:38:57.120 --> 00:39:04.860]
I'm glad we got rid of him years ago, but you're stuck for a while you're just like a little bright spot on the station

[00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:07.780]
I don't listen to anything else on that station. I don't blame him

[00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:08.460]
I don't blame him

[00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:12.760]
And I love the appearance of the new website. I don't know who that fellow is on there flipping his wig

[00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:17.720]
Troy Stratford former dolphins running back from her football player now one of our esteemed salespeople

[00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:18.620]
Is that so?

[00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:21.040]
A man who can't write his own copy but he's not a bad guy

[00:39:21.540 --> 00:39:26.300]
It's real cool. It's a good book. Good book on your website

[00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:28.920]
Well thanks for recognizing our existence and have a great weekend

[00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:31.060]
Absolutely. And you know, could we go off?

[00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:31.660]
I will

[00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:32.640]
Well, Deseretani

[00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:34.160]
I certainly will. Thank you.

[00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:34.820]
Okay, but bye

[00:39:34.820 --> 00:39:36.900]
As soon as the show ends I'm going right to the window and jump

[00:39:37.340 --> 00:39:42.000]
5-6-7-0-5-60, pound 5-60 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line

[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:46.760]
A very silent crowd here this morning. Maybe they want to talk about Ward. We want to talk about the Ward?

[00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:51.020]
No. No. We want to argue about the Iraqis and the Iraqis

[00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:56.800]
And I still don't believe that. I don't care what you say. I don't believe that bogus number she had on there with that. That can't be possible.

[00:39:56.840 --> 00:40:04.620]
The fact that we get all these spy reports all the time. We don't get all these. We get one here and one there like a couple of week maybe at tops on a big week.

[00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:06.400]
And even the negative one.

[00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:07.760]
Carlos, you know what he's talking about?

[00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:09.880]
Never have any of this on the phone.

[00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:12.260]
No, I mean, what are you saying?

[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:18.640]
The old Yenthas, the old talk show groupies. The people were like obsessed with crack from 100 years ago.

[00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:21.480]
That kind of talk was big. About 5 minutes.

[00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:22.540]
Yeah. Exactly.

[00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:24.480]
God.

[00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:26.840]
And what does this fact say?

[00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:31.820]
Well, I wanted to wish you a while on your upcoming vacation. This morning was taped and local on a Howard David had show.

[00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:33.020]
What does that mean?

[00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:34.380]
Taped and local.

[00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:34.980]
I don't know.

[00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:39.380]
The guy's show pop is he was playing the, oh, he were playing the interview with some sports agent from the previous day.

[00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:43.440]
He just wanted to hear himself talk. Probably just wanted to kill some time because Gildey's out looking for another job.

[00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:49.340]
Isn't it funny when they promote the Howard David and show they play a bit about Gildey's wife calling and talking to who wears the pantyhose in the family?

[00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:50.620]
They don't even want to promote Mo.

[00:40:50.940 --> 00:40:54.040]
Well, that bit, by the way, is older than the thusula older than those footprints they found.

[00:40:55.320 --> 00:41:00.220]
I'll miss you next week, but we'll tune into George. Please pass along to George if he gets bored one day once you see the phone's light up.

[00:41:00.340 --> 00:41:03.440]
Pose the question. It's been over 30 years since the dolphins have won the Super Bowl.

[00:41:03.540 --> 00:41:05.220]
What makes you think they went in the next 30 years?

[00:41:05.540 --> 00:41:09.000]
He'll get great response and all you have to do with answer to calls with bits. Yes, no.

[00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:10.900]
Okay, here you go.

[00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:12.840]
No, I don't think George is going to be doing that.

[00:41:12.940 --> 00:41:15.000]
No, no, no, no, no.

[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:20.000]
No, going pretty good until he got to that 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60.

[00:41:20.220 --> 00:41:21.520]
Anyway, I'm going to do the jackparks.

[00:41:21.700 --> 00:41:24.820]
Please, thank you. Now that they got a bunch of calls on, they got enough of this thing.

[00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:27.960]
Jack Parse silenced by stroke.

[00:41:28.940 --> 00:41:33.880]
Legendary talk show host Jack Parse facing his last day without one of his most valuable assets, his ability to speak.

[00:41:35.220 --> 00:41:43.820]
The 84-year-old former tonight show host, close friend Regis Gilbert and Charles Groden rushed to his hospital bedside to try to cheer him up and offer words of comfort to his beloved wife Miriam.

[00:41:44.180 --> 00:41:48.700]
But they were shocked to see the effects on Parse help from a devastating stroke which robbed him of his famous voice.

[00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:54.700]
They tried everything to entertain Jack but all they got was a flicker of a smile and a brief look of understanding Miriam 84 tells the globe.

[00:41:56.240 --> 00:41:57.660]
In an exclusive interview.

[00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:02.940]
Both Regis and Chuck were upset to see Jack this way but neither of them let Jack know they were how they were feeling.

[00:42:03.820 --> 00:42:05.760]
Another was the thing one of the other articles about this.

[00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:10.440]
It's not in this one. It's one of the other tabloids about Jack Par where he was ripping Larry King and some of the other interviews.

[00:42:10.940 --> 00:42:15.540]
And rightfully so he's one of the few guys that's got the balls to rip a lot of the crap that goes on today.

[00:42:15.660 --> 00:42:17.020]
The powder puff interviews and the asking.

[00:42:17.460 --> 00:42:18.400]
You know what I'm talking about?

[00:42:18.740 --> 00:42:19.460]
I'm sure you do.

[00:42:20.540 --> 00:42:23.780]
So poor Jack Par, he may be on a way out and we're pretty upset about that.

[00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:27.300]
Those of us old farts like me and Bokka Brian and that's about it and maybe Mo.

[00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:30.380]
Here's a call from Miami. Hello.

[00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:33.320]
Hey, Neil, I have a question about co-cuting 10.

[00:42:33.980 --> 00:42:34.200]
Yeah.

[00:42:34.940 --> 00:42:36.540]
How many noes rooms do you take a day about?

[00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:38.400]
Between 100 and 200.

[00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:41.500]
Do you think it helped you when you got your stroke?

[00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:44.560]
Just to rebound as fast as you did?

[00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:45.440]
No.

[00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:48.200]
Because I had a very minor and I don't think anything would do with that.

[00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:52.200]
It doesn't have, I don't think it has much to do with your circulation. It has to do with your heart.

[00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:55.040]
I think that's why when I had my stress test which I shouldn't have had.

[00:42:55.280 --> 00:42:57.760]
I think that's why my heart's still in good shape because I've been taking it for years.

[00:42:58.460 --> 00:43:00.860]
I've started taking it about three weeks and I can tell it's different.

[00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:03.400]
Yeah, it'll get you a little bit of your pulse rate way down.

[00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:05.400]
That's what I feel a lot.

[00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:06.760]
It's great for your heart man.

[00:43:06.940 --> 00:43:10.440]
I'm telling you, I wouldn't exaggerate about it. It's very important stuff.

[00:43:10.820 --> 00:43:14.560]
No, I listen to what you say and I got all your meds too so I was pretty good to stuff stuff.

[00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:15.060]
There you go.

[00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:15.720]
Thanks a lot.

[00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:20.580]
Okay, keep popping it man. He's popping it and the only med in a co-cuting 10 too. He's popping it.

[00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:23.200]
What TV reality showed you like best?

[00:43:23.460 --> 00:43:25.840]
Well, the votes are starting to pour in but unfortunately it's not a good sign.

[00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:30.260]
164 but that ain't exactly pouring in either, isn't it?

[00:43:30.260 --> 00:43:32.000]
The 90s say they all suck.

[00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:33.540]
Cut, it's just I, I'm sorry.

[00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:36.840]
I'm sorry but right now I have to draw the line in the sand.

[00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:37.340]
You know what I mean?

[00:43:37.620 --> 00:43:37.800]
Yeah.

[00:43:38.180 --> 00:43:39.840]
What kind of a town is that?

[00:43:40.020 --> 00:43:41.140]
What kind of a place is that?

[00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:42.020]
Sour, chicken.

[00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:42.660]
Sour.

[00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:43.640]
Sour.

[00:43:44.140 --> 00:43:46.280]
That explains so much of the crap we get here out of the phone.

[00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:49.580]
Hey, homo, you know the same old tires, the 20, 70 years later.

[00:43:49.740 --> 00:43:53.680]
The same morons, the same hateful people, the same people just full of this,

[00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:55.500]
they're just this enchanted with life.

[00:43:56.360 --> 00:44:00.820]
Man, maybe we can get the Dr. Mangalita come in for a couple of weeks and take care of some of these people.

[00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:01.540]
A whole bunch of them.

[00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:03.940]
We can have like a mass Dr. Jack had come down, huh?

[00:44:04.340 --> 00:44:09.920]
You know, if you change the question to anything else and still included that option, they all suck.

[00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:10.740]
Don't you think?

[00:44:10.860 --> 00:44:12.780]
Oh, they all suck is, oh I'm just gonna put it on.

[00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:12.980]
Right.

[00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:16.020]
Can you imagine how few votes we'd have if we didn't put the all suck?

[00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:16.940]
It's got 90 votes.

[00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:18.080]
What's your favorite food?

[00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:22.320]
And you've got much more than half of the 164 votes and that's got 94.

[00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:24.720]
That's 55% say they all suck.

[00:44:25.260 --> 00:44:30.880]
The Osborne 16 survivor 14 American Idol 10, real world MTV 7, are you hot 7?

[00:44:31.120 --> 00:44:34.620]
Fear factor 4, blind day 3, any other ones are like small potatoes so far.

[00:44:35.100 --> 00:44:37.380]
They don't watch that crap. They're busy watching important stuff.

[00:44:37.460 --> 00:44:39.700]
They're listening to the NPR and they're watching PBS.

[00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:41.300]
You believe me?

[00:44:41.500 --> 00:44:41.620]
No.

[00:44:41.740 --> 00:44:42.540]
No, of course they're not.

[00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:45.860]
But they're sure a lot more refined intellectual than we are.

[00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:52.080]
We're supporting you 560, 2AM.

[00:44:54.260 --> 00:44:56.300]
Friday you bastard.

[00:44:56.780 --> 00:44:58.920]
Just in time for St. Patrick's Day.

[00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:01.820]
Case-mo records presents drinking songs.

[00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:03.780]
Absolutely much the deal up.

[00:45:04.860 --> 00:45:06.420]
Yeah, you know how I feel.

[00:45:07.380 --> 00:45:11.180]
Classic drinking songs, the whole family can sing together.

[00:45:11.180 --> 00:45:14.820]
Nice Corona, the girl, good to meet you.

[00:45:14.820 --> 00:45:15.800]
Good to meet you.

[00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:17.180]
She look like real lonely.

[00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:18.720]
And they're nice Corona.

[00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:20.500]
I think it's a kisser.

[00:45:20.900 --> 00:45:22.140]
I'm different than hers.

[00:45:22.340 --> 00:45:23.840]
She look like one as shit for her.

[00:45:23.940 --> 00:45:30.320]
Nice Corona, the girl, 2, 3, must be sad.

[00:45:31.580 --> 00:45:32.800]
You're drinking songs.

[00:45:33.060 --> 00:45:36.660]
Or could be for midnight St. Patrick's Day and get a free bar back.

[00:45:36.660 --> 00:45:38.900]
Now I know what was it.

[00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:41.240]
It's a mixed with Yeager, Mister.

[00:45:42.920 --> 00:45:45.040]
There's a bathroom on the right.

[00:45:47.100 --> 00:45:47.900]
All right.

[00:45:48.260 --> 00:45:49.900]
10.02.560 WQM.

[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:51.020]
Happy Friday to instance.

[00:45:51.020 --> 00:45:51.700]
I won't be your Monday.

[00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:52.720]
Happy St. Patrick's Day.

[00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:54.480]
We'll play all the St. Patrick's Day bits today, won't we?

[00:45:54.580 --> 00:45:55.220]
Are you dead?

[00:45:55.840 --> 00:45:56.380]
You bet.

[00:45:56.880 --> 00:45:59.480]
Well, there's a president day updating his efforts on Middle East peace.

[00:46:01.940 --> 00:46:02.340]
Yeah.

[00:46:02.340 --> 00:46:06.840]
Now after recent elections, the nation of Israel has a new government.

[00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:08.720]
All we can say of that is.

[00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:09.760]
Oh, exactly.

[00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:13.700]
Anyway, Josie Lambeade, our close personal friend who used to be the Sun Central

[00:46:13.700 --> 00:46:15.720]
has now moved up into the world with the tabloid to star.

[00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:18.740]
Star confidential is his column.

[00:46:18.860 --> 00:46:20.820]
It says is Jack O. Murray to the mob.

[00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:23.300]
This one you thought that Michael Jackson's life couldn't get any stranger.

[00:46:23.300 --> 00:46:27.140]
He hears some news that shows once again and the truth is stranger than fiction.

[00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:32.440]
Waco Jack O's new friend is a multi-millionaire South Florida tax lawyer and developer

[00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:36.540]
whom law enforcement officials suspected for years of being involved in organized crime.

[00:46:36.660 --> 00:46:38.860]
The king of pop and the mob say they'd so Jack O.

[00:46:39.540 --> 00:46:44.040]
Several sources in the Miami area identified the new man in Jackson's life as Alvin Malnick,

[00:46:44.940 --> 00:46:47.840]
who is famous in the underworld as Jackson is in the pop music world.

[00:46:48.080 --> 00:46:50.460]
They've had dinners together, Michael is stated Alvin's house,

[00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:53.920]
and they've been looking like the best of friends has one source post to Malnick.

[00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:55.620]
So who is this guy Malnick?

[00:46:55.620 --> 00:46:57.120]
Let's just say he's a smart one.

[00:46:57.940 --> 00:46:59.140]
He never got an app for anything.

[00:46:59.380 --> 00:47:04.560]
Through the late 60s and 70s Malnick was an alleged associate of the notorious Florida monster Meyer Lansky.

[00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:08.260]
Oi! Malnick also co-owns Title Ones of America,

[00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:11.500]
a company that charges the poor up to 300% interest on loans.

[00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:15.940]
In the early 80s the New Jersey Gaming Commission didn't mince its words when abandoned

[00:47:15.940 --> 00:47:18.440]
Atlantic City casinos from doing business with Malnick.

[00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:23.640]
You call the 69 year old man a person of unsuitable character and reputation engaged in organized crime.

[00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:29.440]
Malnick denies any mob connection but his back-routed reputation make you wonder why Jackson would hang out with him.

[00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:33.300]
Stewart Beckerman, Jackson's mob piece didn't return calls for comment.

[00:47:33.980 --> 00:47:39.040]
Malnick meanwhile has been entertaining Jackson at the swanky Miami Beach restaurant that he founded, The Forge.

[00:47:40.500 --> 00:47:45.460]
Witnesses saw the two friends chow down on some of the joint's trademark 70 dollar stakes away from prying eyes

[00:47:45.460 --> 00:47:49.240]
in the place's wine cellar where some bottles spent $75,000.

[00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:52.900]
After one such dinner, Jackson was seen serenading Malnick on a piano.

[00:47:56.020 --> 00:47:57.400]
Oh my god!

[00:47:58.200 --> 00:48:01.560]
After one such dinner, Jackson was seen serenading Malnick on a piano.

[00:48:01.700 --> 00:48:04.340]
Oh, it's speaking of playing instruments.

[00:48:05.700 --> 00:48:09.260]
You know Elizabeth Smart that they found in the She's Home and Safe and everything like that?

[00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:09.820]
Yeah.

[00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:12.000]
You know she did a thing for this show?

[00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:14.400]
That's right, she did it for God.

[00:48:16.780 --> 00:48:18.620]
You go girl, let's hear it Liz.

[00:48:22.140 --> 00:48:26.500]
Nine months, she's held against her will and she still does this for us which we appreciate very much.

[00:48:29.220 --> 00:48:31.400]
I don't want to harp on it but...

[00:48:34.740 --> 00:48:39.540]
Energy toward reconciliation, for the world and development.

[00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:45.880]
There can be no peace for either side of the Middle East unless there is freedom for both.

[00:48:48.100 --> 00:48:50.220]
Reaching that destination will not be easy.

[00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:53.760]
We can see the way forward.

[00:48:55.880 --> 00:48:57.780]
Now the parties must take that way.

[00:48:59.020 --> 00:48:59.880]
Step by step.

[00:49:00.060 --> 00:49:01.920]
You can call them on the parties during it.

[00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:08.300]
An America will be the active partner of every party that seeks true peace.

[00:49:11.880 --> 00:49:12.920]
All right.

[00:49:33.620 --> 00:49:34.640]
Nice going, Elizabeth.

[00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:36.080]
Thank you, sweetheart.

[00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:43.880]
Alvin and Michael were having a grand old time one so it says Alvin just had triplets with his 28 year old wife and Michael has three little ones so they have a lot in common.

[00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:50.500]
Malik also opened the doors of his 20 million dollar plus 21 bathroom, 40,000 square foot ocean front mansion to the singer.

[00:49:51.460 --> 00:49:56.800]
Malik is only one of a slew of Laco Jaco hangers on who's raised eyebrows among Jacksonologists.

[00:49:57.600 --> 00:49:59.320]
Do you know the rest of the thing is Jacksonologists?

[00:49:59.660 --> 00:50:00.040]
I do not.

[00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:03.860]
It was just reported that Jackson paid a voodoo dot what we know about that about the spell.

[00:50:05.160 --> 00:50:11.420]
Now comes the alleged mobster Malik by the way emailed confidential that is carefully worded statement when questioned about his relationship with Jackson.

[00:50:11.700 --> 00:50:17.560]
I have no present or past business relationship of any kind with Michael Jackson nor is one contemplated milk at a Malik road.

[00:50:18.660 --> 00:50:25.640]
And then Josie goes on to say you suppose Jackson called him called on him because the voodoo didn't work or were we just witnessing the birth of gangster pop?

[00:50:26.020 --> 00:50:27.620]
That's what Josie Lamby says in the star.

[00:50:27.860 --> 00:50:28.760]
Shame on you Josie.

[00:50:29.260 --> 00:50:34.140]
I think we ought to get a picture of Josie Lamby with that same hair piece bouncing up and down that Troy Stratford's got that would be great.

[00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:35.760]
See if you'll drive down. We got it here in the studio.

[00:50:36.300 --> 00:50:38.400]
Anti-war sheen blows up at exec.

[00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:46.780]
The quiet controversy swirling around television's commander in chief, the opinionated Martin Sheen, who plays president Bartlett on NBC's The West Wing has exploded.

[00:50:48.860 --> 00:50:51.240]
Sheen went ballistic on a rep for the show's maker.

[00:50:51.240 --> 00:50:58.540]
The 62-year-old actor is one visible anti-war advocate out there and his bosses at the show's production company Warner Bros. didn't really like it.

[00:50:58.640 --> 00:51:00.720]
Could be bad for the show's huge ratings, they say.

[00:51:01.260 --> 00:51:02.940]
That view was private until now.

[00:51:03.440 --> 00:51:07.700]
Sheen was being interviewed by a dozen foreign reporters March 5th when the topic of war with the rack was discussed.

[00:51:08.340 --> 00:51:12.980]
I'm told Sheen launched into an ugly tirade calling the Bush administration everything from dogs to crazy.

[00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:17.500]
Warner Vice President Andrew Schiff didn't like it. He stood up between Sheen and the crowd and said,

[00:51:17.500 --> 00:51:20.120]
I'll ask everyone to discuss the show, not politics.

[00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:25.040]
Wrong thing to tell Sheen, his face turned beat red as he stood up and yelled,

[00:51:25.280 --> 00:51:28.800]
we have the right to talk about whatever the hell we want. Who are you to tell us what we can talk about?

[00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:31.900]
Then the two and added about their respective positions with Sheep Singh.

[00:51:32.260 --> 00:51:36.780]
I'm just doing my job and Sheen countering with, do yours and I'll do mine among other things.

[00:51:37.320 --> 00:51:41.660]
Needless to say, Sheen was a no-show with the company's cocktail party afterward as for Sheep Singh,

[00:51:41.660 --> 00:51:45.140]
which acknowledges a brief moment of understanding and adds Martins a passionate guy.

[00:51:45.820 --> 00:51:48.260]
Right, how do you like that? You go, Martin.

[00:51:48.680 --> 00:51:52.640]
Don't mess with old Martin Sheenie, man. He gets pissed off and fired up.

[00:51:53.680 --> 00:52:00.680]
Now, speaking of reality shows, which this audience obviously has once no part of, 54% say they all suck.

[00:52:00.860 --> 00:52:03.020]
Yeah, yeah, back at you, okay? Suck this.

[00:52:05.300 --> 00:52:06.980]
God. Just right off the bag.

[00:52:06.980 --> 00:52:10.320]
You know, like you said, just give that option a negative, they'll grab it, they'll squeeze it.

[00:52:10.800 --> 00:52:13.340]
Everything sucks. They got a foot of option on their life sucks.

[00:52:14.380 --> 00:52:18.200]
Okay? Yeah, seriously. I'm one of the polls in the near future. Life sucks.

[00:52:18.860 --> 00:52:20.620]
What's your favorite thing? It all sucks.

[00:52:22.380 --> 00:52:24.900]
Justin trades Kelly for a guy.

[00:52:25.220 --> 00:52:25.660]
Oi!

[00:52:27.360 --> 00:52:31.200]
Another one of these unbelievable stories that nobody wants to deal with.

[00:52:31.340 --> 00:52:31.840]
You're gay.

[00:52:31.840 --> 00:52:37.440]
Jilted Justin Gaurini is crying on a shoulder of a high school pal after being dumped by American Idol winner Kelly Clarkson.

[00:52:37.820 --> 00:52:42.340]
But those who know that Kuroli heard Kuroon are curious about his close relationship with Michael Leach,

[00:52:42.760 --> 00:52:44.800]
who grew up with the American Idol runner-up in Pennsylvania.

[00:52:45.620 --> 00:52:49.740]
Given the way they often act and publish, some people are wondering if they're closer than they let on, says a friend.

[00:52:50.180 --> 00:52:53.260]
Now that Justin Kelly are over, Michael and Justin couldn't be happier.

[00:52:54.360 --> 00:52:55.060]
You're gay.

[00:52:55.560 --> 00:53:00.500]
Rather than be defensive about the relationship, Michael admits he shares a very special friendship with Justin.

[00:53:01.340 --> 00:53:04.080]
Justin and I are each other's best friend, Michael, tells the star.

[00:53:04.380 --> 00:53:07.080]
Even when we're not together, we've managed to stay close.

[00:53:08.060 --> 00:53:11.500]
Michael who once lived with Justin 24 in Miami, see how it all comes back?

[00:53:11.960 --> 00:53:12.100]
Yeah.

[00:53:12.560 --> 00:53:17.080]
Visited him there while he made the move to the American Idol movie from Justin to Kelly.

[00:53:17.540 --> 00:53:21.900]
Not only did Justin, whose romance with Kelly fizzled during filming, fly Michael to Miami twice,

[00:53:22.180 --> 00:53:24.100]
but he shared his sweet at the Rony Plaza with him.

[00:53:24.460 --> 00:53:26.400]
But we didn't sleep in the same bed, Michael explains.

[00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:36.440]
To blow off steam, the two often hung out at the old Haunt, the studio karaoke bar in the Shubber and Hotel on South Beach.

[00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:38.940]
They'd come together and leave alone, says another source.

[00:53:39.260 --> 00:53:41.520]
Maybe they met Muffin there. He's beginning that karaoke stuff.

[00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:41.900]
You know what?

[00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:45.520]
They'd come together and leave alone.

[00:53:46.080 --> 00:53:48.620]
Shockingly a videotape shot in February and seen by star reporter,

[00:53:48.620 --> 00:53:52.920]
who was just in his close companion, singing Elton John Duetz to one another.

[00:53:53.120 --> 00:53:53.620]
You're gay.

[00:53:54.180 --> 00:53:54.900]
You ready for that?

[00:53:55.760 --> 00:53:56.600]
No, not ready.

[00:53:56.640 --> 00:54:00.260]
It looked like they were looking at each other's eyes when they were singing, says another party out.

[00:54:00.780 --> 00:54:03.140]
It was slightly odd watching them sing love duets.

[00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:06.660]
Michael doesn't hide his strong feelings for Justin, say sources.

[00:54:07.020 --> 00:54:09.860]
He acts as if Justin is his possession of source tells the star.

[00:54:10.120 --> 00:54:10.740]
How do you like that?

[00:54:11.100 --> 00:54:12.580]
But their closeness has led to blowups.

[00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:17.900]
At Crow bar in Ikehub in Miami, Michael stormed out in a huff because he felt people were mobbing justances

[00:54:17.900 --> 00:54:20.780]
and I witnessed Justin found him moping later that night at studio.

[00:54:21.380 --> 00:54:24.020]
That same night, Michael leaped to his feet when a drunk and male party

[00:54:24.020 --> 00:54:27.660]
who were climbed on stage to sing and dance with Justin and wrapped his arms around him.

[00:54:28.020 --> 00:54:32.760]
Justin slipped out of his hole but not before Michael get right up there and start glaring at the guy and I witnessed it.

[00:54:33.500 --> 00:54:35.620]
She stared him down. I mean, he stared him down.

[00:54:36.340 --> 00:54:39.800]
Also with a studio, the two giggle through a computer game of strip poker resources.

[00:54:40.260 --> 00:54:42.860]
You can choose what type of model you wish to play with, says the I witnessed.

[00:54:43.220 --> 00:54:44.500]
They were playing with a male model.

[00:54:46.140 --> 00:54:47.720]
You'd see a picture developing here?

[00:54:48.520 --> 00:54:49.480]
Yeah, like we did.

[00:54:49.480 --> 00:54:51.560]
What did I tell you when that show was first on American Idol?

[00:54:51.700 --> 00:54:55.040]
All these assholes were writing all this stuff about Justin and what's your name?

[00:54:56.120 --> 00:54:56.700]
Kelly, Kelly.

[00:54:57.400 --> 00:55:00.000]
Yeah, all this guy said boy, he looks like a real fruitcake to me.

[00:55:00.060 --> 00:55:06.240]
I mean, he looks a little, you know, believe you me, my Gator is as strong as it gets.

[00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:08.540]
I can sniff one out from a million miles away.

[00:55:08.980 --> 00:55:13.500]
And in his case, even, I mean, I even see me wonder could tell you know, you could smell it.

[00:55:15.580 --> 00:55:20.860]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line.

[00:55:20.980 --> 00:55:22.840]
How's that phone looking, Carlos? Kind of weak in it.

[00:55:23.140 --> 00:55:24.500]
Couple of calls on here. Not too much.

[00:55:24.780 --> 00:55:25.880]
That's okay. I'll do the work today.

[00:55:26.160 --> 00:55:28.480]
It's my last day before vacation. I should have to do all the work.

[00:55:29.840 --> 00:55:33.200]
Which TV reality show do you like best is our poll on neo-roger.com?

[00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:36.100]
Maybe they just aren't voting on to pull that much because they're busy looking at Troy

[00:55:36.100 --> 00:55:39.120]
with Mohawar David's piece bouncing up and down on his head.

[00:55:40.080 --> 00:55:44.700]
They all suck. 117, 53.6% say our reality show is suck.

[00:55:46.380 --> 00:55:52.820]
The odds of born's 20, survivor 17, American Idol 13, real world MTV 10, are you hot Scott 7?

[00:55:54.260 --> 00:55:57.500]
I think it would have more except the fact that you turned him off on that show and almost turned me out.

[00:55:57.700 --> 00:56:04.120]
I just stumbled on a by accident. Fear factor 7, blind date 6, amazing race and Joe millionaire and in a cool...

[00:56:04.880 --> 00:56:08.540]
Smith shows got four based on what?

[00:56:08.820 --> 00:56:11.140]
Maybe the fat brother of it. Oh my God.

[00:56:11.600 --> 00:56:15.500]
Must be the people like that movie, porkeys and all of its sequels.

[00:56:15.920 --> 00:56:17.460]
Porkeys won through 50? Yes.

[00:56:18.180 --> 00:56:20.260]
So let's talk about Caddy's shack. What are you saying?

[00:56:21.520 --> 00:56:24.200]
12 minutes after 10 at 5.60 WDQAM.

[00:56:24.340 --> 00:56:27.200]
Hey, show me the money. Come out to Pompato Harnestack tomorrow, March 15.

[00:56:27.680 --> 00:56:30.260]
And not only will we show you the money, but if you're 18 or older,

[00:56:30.260 --> 00:56:36.260]
you can win a chance to get into the money machine and get 20 seconds to grab as much cash and betting vouchers as you can hold in your hands.

[00:56:36.700 --> 00:56:37.400]
More than a hundred...

[00:56:37.400 --> 00:56:39.280]
More than a thousand...

[00:56:39.760 --> 00:56:40.200]
How many?

[00:56:40.940 --> 00:56:43.600]
I almost said a hundred thousand. Well, dick in the Steve, they'll come up with the extra.

[00:56:44.020 --> 00:56:44.620]
And Brian's serious.

[00:56:45.320 --> 00:56:48.120]
More than a thousand dollars of your up for grabs and it won't cost you a cent to enter,

[00:56:48.200 --> 00:56:51.560]
because Pompato Park has free general parking and free admission every day and night.

[00:56:51.880 --> 00:56:55.360]
But that's not all you can also take any losing betting tickets next Saturday night.

[00:56:55.460 --> 00:56:59.560]
This Saturday and at tomorrow, print your name and address on the back end or win not only a chance to get into the money machine,

[00:56:59.560 --> 00:57:03.840]
but also vacation trips to the Bahamas, including round trip airfare from Fort Lauderdale.

[00:57:04.140 --> 00:57:07.840]
The grand prize they'd trip for two to treasure K Hotel Resort and Marina in Abacota Bahamas.

[00:57:08.020 --> 00:57:09.560]
You must be present to win tomorrow.

[00:57:09.940 --> 00:57:12.460]
That Saturday, March 15, sounds a lot like tomorrow to me.

[00:57:12.780 --> 00:57:14.960]
There'll also be music, fun, great harness racing, action.

[00:57:15.340 --> 00:57:17.600]
Pompato Park, a block south of the 90th Boulevard on Powerline Road.

[00:57:17.880 --> 00:57:20.680]
First post on Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday, 715.

[00:57:21.120 --> 00:57:24.820]
And don't forget, sign all casting every day, 7 days a week, at Pompato Park.

[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:29.800]
The ride and roll, this is 20-year-old bicycle.

[00:57:30.500 --> 00:57:31.420]
You way up.

[00:57:33.120 --> 00:57:34.420]
The West is...

[00:57:34.420 --> 00:57:36.320]
It's like heartburn showtime.

[00:57:36.540 --> 00:57:39.160]
Wait, look, they don't just have heartburn.

[00:57:39.440 --> 00:57:41.440]
They also have pressure and loading, that's gas.

[00:57:41.760 --> 00:57:42.540]
Oh no!

[00:57:44.060 --> 00:57:45.580]
Holy crap, exactly!

[00:57:45.840 --> 00:57:48.200]
Sorry guys, they need more than just heartburn relief.

[00:57:48.520 --> 00:57:49.440]
They need Mee La Tuna.

[00:57:49.700 --> 00:57:51.460]
Yeah, Mee La Tuna, it's a mop.

[00:57:52.540 --> 00:57:55.580]
Fast heartburn relief, plus strong gas relief, Hay Lock Snacks.

[00:57:55.640 --> 00:57:56.560]
Says it's treat diarrhea!

[00:57:57.420 --> 00:57:58.080]
Yes, not!

[00:57:59.680 --> 00:58:01.760]
That's 17 to 560 WQM.

[00:58:01.780 --> 00:58:04.040]
Look at that, the market's up again, 76 points under now.

[00:58:04.280 --> 00:58:08.100]
And a few points under Nasdaq, I can't see what it is if he ever gets his stupid head out of his way.

[00:58:08.560 --> 00:58:09.340]
Come on, let's go here.

[00:58:09.460 --> 00:58:11.660]
Let's put the stupid 7.5 points under Nasdaq.

[00:58:11.680 --> 00:58:13.060]
Not too shabby after a big day yesterday.

[00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:13.780]
What do you think?

[00:58:14.160 --> 00:58:14.720]
Is it on the way back?

[00:58:14.840 --> 00:58:15.020]
No.

[00:58:17.260 --> 00:58:19.240]
567-05, I had a vision last night.

[00:58:19.240 --> 00:58:20.840]
I had a lot of vision, what would you call it?

[00:58:21.040 --> 00:58:22.640]
I was conjuring up a dream.

[00:58:23.140 --> 00:58:23.620]
A night dream.

[00:58:24.880 --> 00:58:29.560]
When I went to bed and I put my head on a pillow, and of course realizing I was doing this show today and then I had next week vacation.

[00:58:30.920 --> 00:58:31.020]
Yeah.

[00:58:31.400 --> 00:58:31.880]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:58:31.980 --> 00:58:36.640]
In other words, I was thinking about going to sleep the night before your last show before vacation.

[00:58:36.920 --> 00:58:38.080]
Or, nearly, I don't think about that.

[00:58:38.380 --> 00:58:43.380]
But I thought about it in the context of what if it was my last show at the end of the contract and they was the last thing?

[00:58:43.540 --> 00:58:44.440]
Oh yeah, right.

[00:58:45.140 --> 00:58:46.340]
And I thought, wow!

[00:58:47.700 --> 00:58:48.020]
Yeah!

[00:58:49.440 --> 00:58:54.880]
Let me tell you right now, if I last that long, if we all stay alive that long, that's going to be some show.

[00:58:55.040 --> 00:58:55.560]
Yeah, what a show.

[00:58:56.220 --> 00:58:58.380]
That is going to be some show.

[00:58:58.940 --> 00:58:59.920]
Make no mistake about it.

[00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:01.420]
I can't wait for that day.

[00:59:01.560 --> 00:59:09.000]
I can't wait for that night before when I put my head on a pillow knowing that when I wake up in the morning, I shave, I smit, I shower, I do all of those SH things.

[00:59:09.320 --> 00:59:10.160]
And I come on the air.

[00:59:11.080 --> 00:59:11.400]
Huh?

[00:59:11.800 --> 00:59:12.420]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:59:12.620 --> 00:59:12.760]
Yeah.

[00:59:12.760 --> 00:59:17.740]
And it's going to be a real barn burr, baby, because I'm not going to hold anything back.

[00:59:17.900 --> 00:59:21.300]
Not that I hold too much back now, but it's all going to flow, man.

[00:59:21.840 --> 00:59:23.420]
Like, opening up most colloscomy back.

[00:59:23.520 --> 00:59:25.580]
It's going to flow and flow and blow.

[00:59:25.820 --> 00:59:27.200]
You just wait and flow some more.

[00:59:27.540 --> 00:59:27.740]
Yeah.

[00:59:28.480 --> 00:59:30.080]
In fact, people will have flow on the show.

[00:59:31.280 --> 00:59:32.500]
Here's a call from Opalaka.

[00:59:32.620 --> 00:59:32.820]
Hello.

[00:59:33.220 --> 00:59:34.280]
Hey, Mio, how are you doing?

[00:59:34.640 --> 00:59:35.100]
Okay, sir.

[00:59:35.500 --> 00:59:36.100]
I got two things.

[00:59:36.260 --> 00:59:36.920]
I have a question.

[00:59:36.920 --> 00:59:41.720]
Who wants the girl that sings that song about Randy's dreamboat?

[00:59:42.680 --> 00:59:43.820]
And I'm a real albergati.

[00:59:44.760 --> 00:59:46.260]
Yeah, that's a great song.

[00:59:46.620 --> 00:59:47.300]
I request that.

[00:59:47.700 --> 00:59:52.900]
And also a suggestion for a future poll, possibly favorite war protest song.

[00:59:54.560 --> 00:59:54.900]
Okay.

[00:59:55.940 --> 00:59:58.840]
I can tell you weapons of mass destruction is mine.

[00:59:59.640 --> 01:00:00.860]
Yeah, I like that.

[01:00:00.860 --> 01:00:07.800]
I like even the Peter Paul Marry, where I've all.

[01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:10.020]
Where I've all the goofballs gone.

[01:00:10.180 --> 01:00:12.060]
Where I've all the folk songs going.

[01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:13.300]
Okay, have a great weekend, pal.

[01:00:13.580 --> 01:00:13.800]
You too.

[01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:14.380]
Have a good vacation.

[01:00:14.820 --> 01:00:15.340]
Thank you.

[01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:18.460]
Where have all the protest songs gone?

[01:00:18.680 --> 01:00:21.560]
We're not going to play no protest songs except the course for weapons of mass destruction.

[01:00:21.860 --> 01:00:24.440]
Which everybody agrees that that Boca-Bride in pieces is a masterpiece.

[01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:25.220]
Did I tell you?

[01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:25.600]
Yes.

[01:00:26.220 --> 01:00:27.140]
Number one with three bullets.

[01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:30.060]
I'm the levably good.

[01:00:30.220 --> 01:00:34.340]
Even people who want the war, even the right wingers out there, even the chicken hawks.

[01:00:34.340 --> 01:00:35.880]
They probably like the song just for the hell of it.

[01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:36.960]
Because it's such a good job.

[01:00:37.340 --> 01:00:38.480]
Nice job, chicken neck.

[01:00:38.820 --> 01:00:39.200]
Oyster neck.

[01:00:41.180 --> 01:00:43.900]
141 people say all TV reality shows suck.

[01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:53.240]
I don't know why I'm looking at that way because I'm forgetting what our poll really in one way.

[01:00:53.480 --> 01:00:54.160]
It's therapy.

[01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:54.860]
Sure.

[01:00:54.860 --> 01:00:59.180]
It's a therapeutic way for these crazy people to get it out of their system.

[01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:00.340]
And no further talking.

[01:01:00.460 --> 01:01:00.860]
Yeah, there you go.

[01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:03.040]
Don't have to suck around and pretend you like him.

[01:01:03.420 --> 01:01:03.740]
Just...

[01:01:03.740 --> 01:01:04.520]
And no further talking.

[01:01:04.620 --> 01:01:05.280]
Everybody sucks.

[01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:06.980]
What's wrong with little sucking?

[01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:09.920]
The Osborne's 24.

[01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:11.680]
And I'll say it again.

[01:01:11.780 --> 01:01:12.540]
I don't like that show by.

[01:01:12.580 --> 01:01:13.040]
I do like him.

[01:01:13.140 --> 01:01:13.560]
He's a hoot.

[01:01:14.300 --> 01:01:17.760]
If they could just show the Pepsi spot over and over again, they'd be better in their show and probably get bigger number.

[01:01:18.700 --> 01:01:20.380]
Survivor 21, American Idol 16.

[01:01:20.820 --> 01:01:21.620]
Real World MTV.

[01:01:21.620 --> 01:01:23.600]
There have been some good shows there at 12.

[01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:25.240]
Fear factor 8.

[01:01:25.420 --> 01:01:25.820]
Blind date.

[01:01:25.980 --> 01:01:26.120]
8.

[01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:26.640]
Are you hot?

[01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:26.940]
7.

[01:01:27.060 --> 01:01:27.240]
Amazing.

[01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:27.720]
Race 6.

[01:01:27.980 --> 01:01:28.680]
Do a millionaire 500.

[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:30.220]
Everybody else small potatoes after that.

[01:01:30.900 --> 01:01:32.140]
Out of 200 and some odd 50.

[01:01:32.300 --> 01:01:33.400]
Whatever it is.

[01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:35.320]
See the problem.

[01:01:35.420 --> 01:01:38.320]
The problem is the demographics on the reality shows.

[01:01:39.420 --> 01:01:42.520]
If I was like still on Zeta who were doing the show like on a real radio station.

[01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:45.440]
Then you'd see first of all, you'd see 400 or 500 votes if they're already.

[01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:46.140]
That's number one.

[01:01:46.300 --> 01:01:48.900]
And number two, instead of they suck, you'd have a lot more enthusiasm.

[01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:49.380]
Right.

[01:01:49.380 --> 01:01:53.320]
Now some of the people in the audience say, well that's caused all those young punks there about your bottle heads.

[01:01:53.380 --> 01:01:53.880]
What do they know?

[01:01:54.140 --> 01:01:55.580]
Well, at least they'd be honest, you know.

[01:01:55.620 --> 01:01:55.720]
Right.

[01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:56.940]
They want to see flesh.

[01:01:57.620 --> 01:01:57.760]
Right.

[01:01:58.140 --> 01:01:59.000]
They want to see flesh.

[01:01:59.160 --> 01:01:59.620]
They want to see.

[01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:00.780]
They want to be a little titillated.

[01:02:00.860 --> 01:02:01.480]
What's wrong with that?

[01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:03.620]
What's wrong with little titillation?

[01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:07.580]
And that's what that one chick said last night to Lorenzo.

[01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:08.240]
What's wrong with little?

[01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:08.960]
Anyway.

[01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:10.980]
But not our crowd, man.

[01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:11.640]
We're on AM.

[01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:13.900]
I've told you for years, AM's garbage.

[01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:14.760]
It's just crap.

[01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:16.480]
The signal is crackly.

[01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:17.980]
AM is like nickers.

[01:02:17.980 --> 01:02:20.180]
It's like white buck shoes, you know.

[01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:23.960]
It went out with men's two piece bathing suits.

[01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:26.360]
AM radio is a fossil.

[01:02:26.540 --> 01:02:34.580]
Of course they have digitalized the AM radio, but I don't think you want to be spending the pucks for digital radio transmission anytime soon.

[01:02:34.820 --> 01:02:36.780]
In addition to which nobody's got any digital receivers anyway.

[01:02:37.460 --> 01:02:37.560]
No.

[01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:38.960]
That was like AM stereo.

[01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:39.520]
Remember that?

[01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:40.200]
No guide.

[01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:46.060]
Remember which meaning we're out, meaning we need running around saying, oh yeah, well we're AM stereo on IOD for about an hour and a half.

[01:02:46.060 --> 01:02:46.720]
I think it wasn't.

[01:02:46.860 --> 01:02:48.560]
Well nobody's got any AM stereo radios.

[01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:49.600]
Oh, oh.

[01:02:51.460 --> 01:02:54.900]
You'd be amazed at how good the stuff sounds and these great speakers I've got here by the way.

[01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:55.880]
You'd be very impressed.

[01:02:56.780 --> 01:02:57.420]
Like that one knee.

[01:02:57.520 --> 01:02:58.800]
What's that one thing on the ACN?

[01:03:00.180 --> 01:03:01.280]
The terrorist warning.

[01:03:01.580 --> 01:03:04.500]
Oh, to it's a beautiful morning that that thing.

[01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:09.960]
If you could hear the sounds, the bells and the chimes and one channel to be able to once amazing.

[01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:14.580]
I'm just rambling again because I'm fantasizing about that last show.

[01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:16.780]
Is that going to be great?

[01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:18.640]
Here's Miami.

[01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:18.980]
Hello.

[01:03:22.540 --> 01:03:23.660]
Yeah, he'll be on it.

[01:03:24.700 --> 01:03:25.580]
Here's Boyton Beach.

[01:03:25.860 --> 01:03:27.360]
Hello, Neil.

[01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:28.200]
Yes, sir.

[01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:29.300]
Hey, how you doing, man?

[01:03:29.700 --> 01:03:29.920]
Okay.

[01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:31.720]
I just want to comment on reality TV.

[01:03:32.260 --> 01:03:32.500]
Uh huh.

[01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:33.440]
Well, you know, it's funny.

[01:03:33.580 --> 01:03:37.480]
When I was a little kid they used to tell me all the time that nothing that you saw on TV was real.

[01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:40.980]
And now today it seems like everything on TV they're trying to tell you is real.

[01:03:40.980 --> 01:03:42.280]
No, we all know it's not real.

[01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:47.020]
I mean, you know, let's all agree on it to begin with except some people that are morons that are very naive.

[01:03:47.020 --> 01:03:48.060]
We all know it's not real.

[01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:49.600]
But that's not the point.

[01:03:49.780 --> 01:03:52.400]
The point is you can still enjoy it if there's enough interesting stuff to watch.

[01:03:52.520 --> 01:03:53.000]
This is true.

[01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:55.400]
It is great entertainment, but it's far from reality.

[01:03:56.020 --> 01:03:56.760]
No, no question.

[01:03:57.740 --> 01:03:58.160]
All right.

[01:03:58.240 --> 01:03:59.600]
Well, I just want to give my two cents.

[01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:01.160]
Thank you for your vacation, man.

[01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:01.680]
Thanks very much.

[01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:06.760]
I mean, whoever said TV had anything to do with reality TV is like Howard Beale said that great speech about work carnival.

[01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:07.540]
We're a circus show.

[01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:09.000]
We're like, you know, freaks and whatever.

[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:09.460]
That's right.

[01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:11.940]
God, that was a great movie.

[01:04:12.060 --> 01:04:13.860]
It's too bad more if you haven't seen network, you know.

[01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:14.960]
But it's my coast.

[01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:17.300]
You know me, my bizarre taste.

[01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:20.300]
I'm way out there on the edge on the fringe of human existence.

[01:04:22.140 --> 01:04:25.520]
5, 6, 7, oh, there's the guy from Sandy Utah from the police.

[01:04:25.740 --> 01:04:26.120]
It's over.

[01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:26.900]
Yeah.

[01:04:28.740 --> 01:04:29.440]
Thank God.

[01:04:29.580 --> 01:04:30.000]
Thank you.

[01:04:30.180 --> 01:04:30.800]
Thank you.

[01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:31.640]
There was a guy.

[01:04:31.920 --> 01:04:32.460]
It's over.

[01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:33.500]
He said, Elizabeth's home.

[01:04:33.620 --> 01:04:34.020]
It's over.

[01:04:34.980 --> 01:04:36.440]
Oh, that was, you know something?

[01:04:36.860 --> 01:04:40.720]
I think that was right in league with that was right in there, man.

[01:04:40.900 --> 01:04:41.160]
Let's go.

[01:04:41.220 --> 01:04:42.500]
Another one of my magic moments.

[01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:46.360]
5, 6, 7, oh, 5, 60.

[01:04:47.100 --> 01:04:47.840]
Palm 5, 60.

[01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:49.440]
Let's talk about something exciting here today.

[01:04:49.460 --> 01:04:50.900]
I don't want to sit here and read all these tabloids.

[01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:55.840]
I do have one about Catherine Hepburn, by the way, which we've been very Catherine Hepburn intensively.

[01:04:55.900 --> 01:04:57.820]
And guess who was on biography channel last night?

[01:04:58.080 --> 01:04:58.500]
Catherine Hepburn.

[01:04:58.700 --> 01:04:59.100]
Good guess.

[01:05:00.040 --> 01:05:00.700]
Excellent guess.

[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:03.900]
Remember we discovered that she's still alive?

[01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:04.200]
Yeah.

[01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:06.720]
She didn't do nearly as well on our death poles.

[01:05:06.980 --> 01:05:07.500]
I thought she would.

[01:05:07.580 --> 01:05:10.200]
And now if they would have known, guess how old she is?

[01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:16.140]
But if you could see this picture, you would swear that she's not still alive.

[01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:20.200]
Anyway, it says still feisty Catherine Hepburn turning 96.

[01:05:20.980 --> 01:05:22.700]
And she's held back to making it to 100.

[01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:25.260]
Oh, and they're going to move to sunrise lakes.

[01:05:26.300 --> 01:05:28.960]
Man, if you could see this picture, well, you know what we get to 96.

[01:05:29.960 --> 01:05:32.440]
Most of us hope we only look that good if we get to 96.

[01:05:34.380 --> 01:05:36.020]
I'll be honest with you, Ma looks alive.

[01:05:36.060 --> 01:05:38.360]
I'm not not that Ma's 96, but she's getting there.

[01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:40.260]
Looks a lot better than this.

[01:05:41.080 --> 01:05:42.460]
Although she's still the same.

[01:05:44.220 --> 01:05:47.280]
56670560, pound 560 on EAT and T in Verizon Line.

[01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:48.380]
Here's a lady in Miami.

[01:05:48.380 --> 01:05:48.740]
Hello.

[01:05:49.800 --> 01:05:50.440]
Yes, ma'am.

[01:05:50.540 --> 01:05:51.040]
Hey, Neil.

[01:05:51.820 --> 01:05:54.560]
I wanted to ask you, who is that that you guys use on that bit?

[01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:55.560]
This is about 30.

[01:05:56.740 --> 01:05:57.600]
Who is that?

[01:05:57.860 --> 01:05:59.180]
Yeah, where does that come from?

[01:05:59.260 --> 01:05:59.740]
Is that like a football?

[01:05:59.740 --> 01:06:01.600]
That whole dirty bastard from that Regis bit.

[01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:02.340]
Oh, okay.

[01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:04.120]
Can I ask you a question and have you played it again?

[01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:06.680]
I beg your pardon?

[01:06:06.940 --> 01:06:08.640]
I want to ask you a question and then you play that bit.

[01:06:09.260 --> 01:06:09.600]
Oh, okay.

[01:06:10.020 --> 01:06:10.320]
Okay.

[01:06:10.860 --> 01:06:15.540]
You know that surgeon who did the surgery on Feedler's Thumb?

[01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:20.440]
How many surgeries did he need to use on Moly's hair piece?

[01:06:20.860 --> 01:06:21.520]
I heard him.

[01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:22.420]
There you go.

[01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:23.300]
Good setup.

[01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:23.740]
Thank you.

[01:06:23.780 --> 01:06:24.520]
I'll miss you next week.

[01:06:24.860 --> 01:06:25.180]
Thanks.

[01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:25.440]
Bye.

[01:06:29.260 --> 01:06:31.560]
Are they picking on Moly's hair piece again?

[01:06:31.740 --> 01:06:32.500]
Yeah, good.

[01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:34.180]
Hey, Bozo.

[01:06:34.180 --> 01:06:34.980]
They already know.

[01:06:35.180 --> 01:06:36.400]
They're already listening to billboards.

[01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:37.220]
Why do you tell them?

[01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:38.240]
Because they want to see him.

[01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:38.780]
Asshole.

[01:06:39.240 --> 01:06:42.740]
See, I'm not going to call him Bozo because that's like a clown, you know?

[01:06:43.180 --> 01:06:43.440]
Mozo.

[01:06:44.100 --> 01:06:44.920]
Yeah, Mozo.

[01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:45.900]
That's, I like that.

[01:06:46.120 --> 01:06:46.500]
Very good.

[01:06:46.900 --> 01:06:47.640]
Hey, Mozo.

[01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:51.340]
We're telling them where they are because they'd like to take a look at him.

[01:06:51.420 --> 01:06:52.220]
You asshole.

[01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:53.180]
You invasible.

[01:06:53.320 --> 01:06:53.880]
You moron.

[01:06:53.880 --> 01:06:54.960]
You crusty old fart.

[01:06:55.040 --> 01:06:55.820]
You asshole.

[01:06:55.880 --> 01:06:57.660]
And Doreen hates you by the way like poison.

[01:06:57.780 --> 01:06:59.840]
She wishes you would die a wicked nasty death.

[01:06:59.940 --> 01:07:00.960]
You asshole.

[01:07:01.100 --> 01:07:01.900]
How do you like that, Mo?

[01:07:03.580 --> 01:07:03.900]
Boy.

[01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:07.160]
Mozo.

[01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:08.000]
I love that.

[01:07:08.260 --> 01:07:08.400]
Correct.

[01:07:08.500 --> 01:07:09.520]
There's another great bid for you.

[01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:10.740]
Mozo, the clown.

[01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:12.400]
Don't you like it?

[01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:13.120]
I can hear it already.

[01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:13.720]
Hey, Brian.

[01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:14.900]
I'll call him after the shot.

[01:07:15.500 --> 01:07:17.060]
26 after 10 and 5 60.

[01:07:17.140 --> 01:07:17.620]
Double know me.

[01:07:17.720 --> 01:07:18.120]
Forget it.

[01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:21.060]
I got to that spot after the show because of what's his name?

[01:07:21.060 --> 01:07:21.300]
I'm not sure.

[01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:21.700]
I'm not sure.

[01:07:21.700 --> 01:07:21.860]
I'm not sure.

[01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:22.240]
I'm not sure.

[01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:22.700]
I'm not sure.

[01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:23.900]
I'm not sure.

[01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:25.580]
I'm not sure.

[01:07:25.580 --> 01:07:26.120]
I'm not sure.

[01:07:26.120 --> 01:07:26.800]
I'm not sure.

[01:07:28.220 --> 01:07:29.800]
I'm not sure.

[01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:29.920]
I'm not sure.

[01:07:29.920 --> 01:07:29.940]
I'm not sure.

[01:07:29.940 --> 01:07:29.940]

[01:07:29.940 --> 01:07:29.940]

[01:07:29.940 --> 01:07:30.660]
I'm not sure.

[01:07:30.660 --> 01:07:30.660]

[01:07:30.660 --> 01:07:30.660]

[01:07:30.660 --> 01:07:30.660]

[01:07:30.700 --> 01:07:31.300]
I'm not sure.

[01:07:31.300 --> 01:07:31.900]
I'm not sure.

[01:07:31.900 --> 01:07:32.360]
I'm not sure.

[01:07:32.360 --> 01:07:33.280]
I'm not sure.

[01:07:34.860 --> 01:07:36.020]
I'm not sure.

[01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:38.620]
I'm not sure.

[01:07:38.620 --> 01:07:39.080]
I'm not sure.

[01:07:41.400 --> 01:07:42.520]
I'm not sure.

[01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:45.580]
I'm not sure.

[01:07:45.980 --> 01:07:47.700]
I'm not sure.

[01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:50.940]
I'm not sure.

[01:07:52.120 --> 01:07:55.900]
And the MO piece is just pop it up and down on his bald on his skinheads.

[01:07:55.900 --> 01:07:56.620]
A lovely thing.

[01:07:57.020 --> 01:07:58.880]

Here.

[01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:25.000]
Renting on the airways, horny, bitchy one.

[01:09:27.180 --> 01:09:30.880]
Fennacies will have to do.

[01:09:31.420 --> 01:09:33.220]
You ain't getting on.

[01:09:35.940 --> 01:09:39.100]
Reality escapes you.

[01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:42.080]
You lie and you scheme.

[01:09:44.300 --> 01:09:47.200]
Randy, dream on Randy.

[01:09:48.340 --> 01:09:49.800]
You'll never have me.

[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:55.340]
Sorry, steamboat Randy.

[01:09:56.540 --> 01:09:58.580]
Little bitch with dreams.

[01:09:58.580 --> 01:10:07.960]
Going down life's sink in highway is that sad.

[01:10:08.840 --> 01:10:10.400]
Lonely clouds.

[01:10:12.520 --> 01:10:23.220]
Everyone knows the only one who's ego's in the clouds.

[01:10:25.080 --> 01:10:33.700]
That bloodshot and wasted talking trash with a smile.

[01:10:34.660 --> 01:10:42.820]
Your heads up your ass and ain't been out in a while.

[01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:43.640]
Back down.

[01:10:45.880 --> 01:10:51.680]
It ain't been out in a while.

[01:10:52.340 --> 01:10:55.440]
I think that mole is old enough to collect antisocial security, don't you?

[01:10:56.680 --> 01:10:57.400]
1033-5.

[01:10:57.560 --> 01:11:04.660]
So when we are at old station, let's face it, there's a bunch of old fat guys mostly juiced in around like they're promoing on a fox thing and we're proud of it.

[01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:07.220]
You know, I've got to be pushing 64-65.

[01:11:08.260 --> 01:11:11.800]
And I just turned 60 and Hank is a little bit older than I am a few months.

[01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:14.280]
And Mad Dog, let me tell you this.

[01:11:14.940 --> 01:11:16.740]
People think because he sounds young, that's great.

[01:11:16.740 --> 01:11:17.740]
Of course I sound young too.

[01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:20.380]
But stop and think about it.

[01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:26.660]
When Mad Dog was on the dolphins and they went back to back championships, those super balls, how many years ago do you think that was?

[01:11:27.180 --> 01:11:28.220]
About third man.

[01:11:28.580 --> 01:11:28.900]
Exactly.

[01:11:29.900 --> 01:11:31.120]
72 and 73.

[01:11:31.500 --> 01:11:36.840]
I got those old pictures from that I brought with us from IOD, the old promotional pictures.

[01:11:37.220 --> 01:11:39.060]
You're putting Madditch and Bo Camp on all these people.

[01:11:39.580 --> 01:11:42.120]
What a thick lustrous head of hair.

[01:11:42.520 --> 01:11:42.940]
Madditch had.

[01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:43.760]
Did he really?

[01:11:43.980 --> 01:11:44.100]
Yeah.

[01:11:44.440 --> 01:11:45.600]
Did you want to run your fingers through it?

[01:11:45.700 --> 01:11:46.200]
No, not me.

[01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:47.420]
Oh, me either.

[01:11:47.420 --> 01:11:48.900]
But anyway, he's a great guy.

[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:50.180]
We love to Mad Dog and everybody else.

[01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:55.040]
Two, he won that poor yesterday in spite of how the sperm people had desperately tried to screw it up there at the end.

[01:11:55.140 --> 01:11:56.140]
And I have no idea why.

[01:11:56.740 --> 01:12:04.520]
You know, when you've got that much success, when you have that much money, when you have that much fame, why is it that this insecurity always goes through his audience?

[01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:05.320]
What is that all about?

[01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:06.900]
The Howard's sperm audience.

[01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:08.600]
I don't know, the emotional cripples.

[01:12:09.100 --> 01:12:09.640]
Could be.

[01:12:09.780 --> 01:12:10.700]
I don't know what that's all about.

[01:12:11.140 --> 01:12:14.720]
Joe Rose for the Mad Dog today at one because Mad Dog is on his way to a weekend.

[01:12:15.500 --> 01:12:17.480]
Hank is a three from Gulfstream.

[01:12:17.480 --> 01:12:18.820]
Plunge in his brains out over there.

[01:12:19.200 --> 01:12:19.580]
Six, fifty.

[01:12:19.740 --> 01:12:21.240]
You have against Rutgers baseball.

[01:12:22.100 --> 01:12:27.480]
After the UM baseball game at EK and in two to seven in the morning at CSPN radio because, you know, it's cheap.

[01:12:28.580 --> 01:12:30.780]
Here's our chronic, our most chronic of all factors.

[01:12:31.780 --> 01:12:33.240]
You know, I'm thinking about this factor.

[01:12:33.260 --> 01:12:34.180]
You know that you just sent me?

[01:12:34.980 --> 01:12:35.340]
Yeah.

[01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:37.300]
For factors every day at least once.

[01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:40.680]
Didn't we have a period where he sent us a couple of hostels?

[01:12:40.980 --> 01:12:42.020]
You know, they all get cranky.

[01:12:42.100 --> 01:12:42.900]
That's the thing, you know.

[01:12:43.260 --> 01:12:44.100]
They get cranky.

[01:12:44.600 --> 01:12:48.480]
Not that many months ago he sent us something at all bent out of shape and, you know, was spewing.

[01:12:49.220 --> 01:12:53.160]
But anyways, it's just how the QM staff on a picture page of your website observations.

[01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:54.880]
Josh Darrow has to be gay.

[01:12:55.280 --> 01:12:56.740]
Greg Reed has to be gay, you know.

[01:12:57.220 --> 01:12:58.560]
And Lou Ann is a hottie.

[01:12:58.720 --> 01:13:00.160]
Absolutely positively not.

[01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:00.520]
Wow.

[01:13:01.180 --> 01:13:03.380]
Get this man some MagnaVision reading glasses.

[01:13:03.620 --> 01:13:04.980]
Okay, maybe Mikey, let's them behind.

[01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:06.540]
Lou Ann is a hottie.

[01:13:06.620 --> 01:13:07.220]
Wow, even.

[01:13:07.340 --> 01:13:07.560]
Bro!

[01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:08.420]
I wouldn't say that.

[01:13:09.020 --> 01:13:11.060]
She's about as hot as a goddamn ice cube.

[01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:12.440]
Get serious.

[01:13:12.440 --> 01:13:14.220]
Well maybe he was drunk when he was looking at the website.

[01:13:14.340 --> 01:13:14.760]
That could be.

[01:13:14.840 --> 01:13:15.600]
Maybe he was looking at the website.

[01:13:15.700 --> 01:13:17.960]
Now, maybe he was looking at a Troy Stratford when that lovely piece on.

[01:13:18.060 --> 01:13:19.100]
That could be it.

[01:13:20.060 --> 01:13:22.480]
5'6'7'05'60".

[01:13:22.480 --> 01:13:23.300]
That's 5'60.

[01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:24.840]
The lovely piece on earth.

[01:13:25.300 --> 01:13:26.320]
It's a beautiful thing.

[01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:26.920]
Make no mistake.

[01:13:28.120 --> 01:13:31.040]
In fact, maybe the caption on it should say,

[01:13:31.340 --> 01:13:33.120]
Troy Stratford says, give piece a chance.

[01:13:35.240 --> 01:13:36.220]
Here's Miami, hello.

[01:13:37.340 --> 01:13:38.000]
I'm Climio.

[01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:38.800]
Yes, sir.

[01:13:39.340 --> 01:13:39.820]
Good morning.

[01:13:39.820 --> 01:13:41.200]
And back to you.

[01:13:41.480 --> 01:13:45.840]
Well, first and foremost, I want to congratulate George for winning the poll.

[01:13:46.060 --> 01:13:47.300]
You as a gay poll, remember?

[01:13:48.540 --> 01:13:48.680]
Yeah.

[01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:49.700]
Okay.

[01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:49.920]

[01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:52.420]
5'6'7'05'60".

[01:13:52.420 --> 01:13:54.260]
5'60 on the AT&T.

[01:13:54.720 --> 01:13:56.320]
Same old, tired trolls.

[01:13:56.540 --> 01:13:58.940]
Man, that last show was starting to sound really appealing to me.

[01:13:59.500 --> 01:14:01.100]
Maybe we can fast forward.

[01:14:01.620 --> 01:14:04.060]
Get a hold of James Dere and Pat Boone.

[01:14:04.180 --> 01:14:05.060]
Give me that time tunnel.

[01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:06.880]
And Malcolm McDowell.

[01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:11.180]
Fast forward like 3.5 years to that very last show on QAIM.

[01:14:11.400 --> 01:14:16.580]
And then we'll actually invite all of these lifeless group balls to call them for one last time.

[01:14:17.580 --> 01:14:20.460]
You know, we'll have Eddie on Eddie, all of them.

[01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:22.880]
Got one of the eyes, the guy with a fanny pack.

[01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:25.200]
One of those people going to do, by the way.

[01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:27.120]
Oh, they said, by the way, by the by.

[01:14:27.380 --> 01:14:28.420]
One of those people going to do.

[01:14:28.620 --> 01:14:30.900]
Well, I'm saving up for lots of gasoline.

[01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:33.660]
We're going to have one giant mass emulation for them all.

[01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:35.240]
That sounds good.

[01:14:35.240 --> 01:14:36.580]
My word, as well.

[01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:37.240]
My word, as well.

[01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:39.120]
Here's Miami.

[01:14:39.260 --> 01:14:39.380]
Hello.

[01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:39.940]
When is this?

[01:14:41.660 --> 01:14:42.200]
Miami.

[01:14:43.720 --> 01:14:44.640]
Hello, my deans.

[01:14:44.920 --> 01:14:45.280]
Yes, sir.

[01:14:46.340 --> 01:14:49.060]
Yeah, these reality TV programs.

[01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:49.780]

[01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:51.840]

Yeah.

[01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:58.000]
A good comedy, a good drama, anything to be better.

[01:14:58.340 --> 01:15:02.500]

[01:22:16.840 --> 01:22:16.940]
I'm not a man.

[01:22:17.240 --> 01:22:18.440]
I'm not a man.

[01:22:18.560 --> 01:22:20.420]
I'm not a man.

[01:22:20.580 --> 01:22:21.780]
I'm not a man.

[01:22:22.020 --> 01:22:23.160]
I'm not a man.

[01:22:23.160 --> 01:22:23.960]
I'm not a man.

[01:22:24.720 --> 01:22:25.280]
I'm not a man.

[01:22:25.280 --> 01:22:27.080]
I'm not a man.

[01:22:27.080 --> 01:22:28.940]
I'm not a man.

[01:22:28.940 --> 01:22:29.420]
It's stuck.

[01:22:29.720 --> 01:22:30.560]
And it's a good one.

[01:22:30.720 --> 01:22:31.560]
You've got a hundred dollars.

[01:22:31.940 --> 01:22:32.880]
Run, you run, you run.

[01:22:33.260 --> 01:22:35.240]
Run, jump, jump, jump, jump, Например.

[01:22:36.320 --> 01:22:37.040]
Ten fortities.

[01:22:37.220 --> 01:22:39.300]
We got that fax pouring-off the machine one moment please.

[01:22:39.560 --> 01:22:39.780]
Mm-hmm.

[01:22:39.980 --> 01:22:40.740]
Yeah, theverithin.

[01:22:41.260 --> 01:22:42.760]
Oh, I thought it was going to be something really awesome.

[01:22:43.580 --> 01:22:43.580]

[01:22:44.240 --> 01:22:46.740]
You know something like the faxés are becoming as chronic as

[01:22:46.740 --> 01:22:47.660]
the carers becoming?

[01:22:48.940 --> 01:22:51.800]
boners' blend really has low downpadded's, so I just heard

[01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:55.300]
a bit about the billboards and knives ... it's cute.

[01:22:56.140 --> 01:22:57.960]
one thing of many that drives me crazy.

[01:22:58.860 --> 01:23:00.380]
Hello, he has to say program.

[01:23:00.540 --> 01:23:03.260]
Well, that's old real old fashion, you know, old parts like him.

[01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:04.920]
Even older than me.

[01:23:05.860 --> 01:23:08.020]
I guess a program is more important than a show.

[01:23:08.160 --> 01:23:11.060]
So look for the upcoming name change, the Howard David program.

[01:23:11.400 --> 01:23:11.760]
Okay.

[01:23:13.180 --> 01:23:15.160]
The Howard David Mozo show.

[01:23:16.020 --> 01:23:18.040]
10 before 11 at 560 W. Come.

[01:23:18.160 --> 01:23:19.880]
I'm thinking of playing like stuff the rest of the day

[01:23:19.880 --> 01:23:21.520]
because they don't seem to have very much material to do.

[01:23:21.700 --> 01:23:22.600]
You notice that.

[01:23:23.120 --> 01:23:23.900]
But it's Friday.

[01:23:24.180 --> 01:23:25.160]
Friday is generally a lately.

[01:23:25.400 --> 01:23:26.140]
I've been pretty well.

[01:23:26.140 --> 01:23:28.600]
It probably gets the spring break thing and weekend thing.

[01:23:28.660 --> 01:23:28.940]
Yeah.

[01:23:28.980 --> 01:23:30.020]
The war thing.

[01:23:30.280 --> 01:23:31.440]
The war thing they're getting ready for it.

[01:23:31.480 --> 01:23:32.920]
They're in the home depot now getting all their

[01:23:32.920 --> 01:23:33.660]
goddamn duct tape.

[01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.380]
They're showing all these assholes out there protesting against

[01:23:36.380 --> 01:23:37.020]
the war protesters.

[01:23:37.200 --> 01:23:37.840]
That's the new thing.

[01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:38.060]
Yeah.

[01:23:38.180 --> 01:23:40.560]
All the right wing top show host, which is almost every one of them.

[01:23:40.680 --> 01:23:42.400]
They're whipping up all their people going out there with their

[01:23:42.400 --> 01:23:43.940]
American flags and their weapon.

[01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:44.480]
Everybody up.

[01:23:44.500 --> 01:23:46.580]
Let's kill Martin Sheen and Barbara Streisand.

[01:23:46.800 --> 01:23:47.480]
You know, that kind of crap.

[01:23:47.760 --> 01:23:49.160]
They're getting pissed off from far enough.

[01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:51.460]
Let's do something patriotic like kill a bunch of people.

[01:23:51.460 --> 01:23:52.200]
That's right.

[01:23:53.760 --> 01:23:54.920]
Here's North Miami Beach.

[01:23:54.920 --> 01:23:55.160]
Hello.

[01:23:56.020 --> 01:23:56.760]
Good morning, Neil.

[01:23:57.140 --> 01:23:57.580]
Yes, sir.

[01:23:57.900 --> 01:23:58.140]
How are you?

[01:23:58.400 --> 01:24:00.440]
I realize you weren't taking suggestions for the poll.

[01:24:00.700 --> 01:24:01.380]
But I want to go opinion.

[01:24:01.460 --> 01:24:03.040]
You think cops is reality or no?

[01:24:04.060 --> 01:24:05.000]
I never watched it.

[01:24:05.200 --> 01:24:05.540]
Technically.

[01:24:06.240 --> 01:24:06.640]
Is it?

[01:24:06.720 --> 01:24:07.020]
It's a crop.

[01:24:07.380 --> 01:24:08.880]
They just follow cops around with the camera.

[01:24:09.160 --> 01:24:09.840]
Is it a good show?

[01:24:10.340 --> 01:24:11.180]
It can be.

[01:24:11.320 --> 01:24:11.700]
It has been.

[01:24:12.840 --> 01:24:13.860]
Has the potential to be.

[01:24:13.940 --> 01:24:17.040]
I mean, if you like blood and gore and car crashes and drug

[01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:19.720]
war and beat up, you mean we're going to should be our president?

[01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:20.160]
OK.

[01:24:20.160 --> 01:24:20.820]
Well, think about it.

[01:24:20.820 --> 01:24:22.000]
We'll give it some considerations, sir.

[01:24:22.100 --> 01:24:22.500]
Thank you.

[01:24:22.500 --> 01:24:23.620]
You think cops should be on air?

[01:24:23.880 --> 01:24:24.320]
Yeah, sure.

[01:24:25.300 --> 01:24:25.800]
Do you do?

[01:24:26.620 --> 01:24:27.060]
For what?

[01:24:27.120 --> 01:24:28.860]
Now you're going to get Eric all bent out of shape.

[01:24:28.860 --> 01:24:29.960]
We got everything on it.

[01:24:30.140 --> 01:24:30.640]
We're all ready.

[01:24:31.040 --> 01:24:31.400]
And what?

[01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:32.380]
I wouldn't want to do that.

[01:24:32.740 --> 01:24:33.340]
Don't do that.

[01:24:33.340 --> 01:24:34.620]
We got 357 votes.

[01:24:34.640 --> 01:24:35.380]
That's not bad.

[01:24:35.520 --> 01:24:36.200]
Not still our fact.

[01:24:36.300 --> 01:24:38.100]
We had a whole bunch of them that don't have any votes yet.

[01:24:38.140 --> 01:24:39.080]
Like I'm a celebrity, sir.

[01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:40.220]
We're a life-batch lorette.

[01:24:40.460 --> 01:24:42.440]
Shipmates, fraternity, life, Nashville, star.

[01:24:42.780 --> 01:24:43.940]
Oh, there's a zillion of them here.

[01:24:44.100 --> 01:24:45.660]
Road rules doesn't have any.

[01:24:45.740 --> 01:24:46.500]
And of course, you know why?

[01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:47.280]
Why?

[01:24:47.720 --> 01:24:48.640]
That's not our crowd.

[01:24:48.700 --> 01:24:49.920]
Our crowd don't watch road to me.

[01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:50.940]
They don't watch MTV.

[01:24:51.220 --> 01:24:52.400]
Although real world's got 14.

[01:24:53.240 --> 01:24:53.420]
True.

[01:24:53.620 --> 01:24:54.460]
That must have been a mistake.

[01:24:56.040 --> 01:24:58.360]
What TV reality show do you like the best we ask?

[01:24:58.480 --> 01:25:00.820]
They all suck 188.52.6%.

[01:25:01.460 --> 01:25:02.440]
And you know something.

[01:25:02.520 --> 01:25:03.460]
I'm being hard on those people.

[01:25:03.500 --> 01:25:05.920]
But up until last night, my scene at R.U. Hunt,

[01:25:06.020 --> 01:25:07.080]
I would have voted that too.

[01:25:08.520 --> 01:25:09.840]
No, I already said that.

[01:25:09.900 --> 01:25:10.740]
I would have voted for real world.

[01:25:11.660 --> 01:25:13.320]
So like I said, I wouldn't say they all suck.

[01:25:14.040 --> 01:25:16.480]
Osborne 36, your vibrant 28, American Idol 22,

[01:25:16.480 --> 01:25:18.400]
real world 14, fear factor 10.

[01:25:18.500 --> 01:25:20.160]
Are you hot and blind date each with nine?

[01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:22.160]
Each with only nine.

[01:25:22.820 --> 01:25:23.720]
It's not our crowd, man.

[01:25:24.980 --> 01:25:26.880]
Our crowd is only in moldy, baby.

[01:25:27.100 --> 01:25:28.260]
Old and moldy.

[01:25:28.380 --> 01:25:29.620]
We got the Geratoral set.

[01:25:29.760 --> 01:25:31.060]
We got the Palladant crowd now.

[01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:33.380]
That's what clearance is.

[01:25:33.520 --> 01:25:36.460]
Those demographics are getting older and older and older.

[01:25:36.720 --> 01:25:38.040]
Let's hire a few more old hosts.

[01:25:38.280 --> 01:25:38.940]
Incredible clearance.

[01:25:38.940 --> 01:25:39.620]
You're doing it.

[01:25:40.980 --> 01:25:42.860]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 6, 10.

[01:25:42.860 --> 01:25:44.360]
I last attempt to get these lines

[01:25:44.360 --> 01:25:45.060]
and smoke it on here.

[01:25:45.160 --> 01:25:45.860]
Otherwise, we're going to like,

[01:25:46.360 --> 01:25:48.020]
we only be two hours anyway.

[01:25:48.860 --> 01:25:49.620]
Because we got seen.

[01:25:49.740 --> 01:25:52.700]
Patty's day coming up and play mostly bits the rest of the way.

[01:25:53.180 --> 01:25:54.560]
I hate to do because people say,

[01:25:54.700 --> 01:25:55.560]
well, that's a cop out.

[01:25:55.580 --> 01:25:57.320]
He's going to make a case now Monday, God damn it.

[01:25:58.460 --> 01:26:00.040]
But you're just laying down again.

[01:26:00.620 --> 01:26:01.500]
Here's a call from Jupiter.

[01:26:01.660 --> 01:26:01.820]
Hello.

[01:26:02.420 --> 01:26:05.320]
Two of the best things I like about raping Mo are.

[01:26:05.860 --> 01:26:08.640]
I never have to worry about getting AIDS because that's

[01:26:08.640 --> 01:26:08.640]

[01:26:08.720 --> 01:26:09.580]
Oh, God.

[01:26:10.980 --> 01:26:12.120]
Oh, that voice.

[01:26:13.200 --> 01:26:13.920]
That voice.

[01:26:16.040 --> 01:26:17.680]
Five six seven oh five six.

[01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:18.760]
The pound five six.

[01:26:18.940 --> 01:26:21.600]
The on the AT&T and Verizon wireless lines,

[01:26:21.680 --> 01:26:23.520]
just stop and think about what a public service we do on

[01:26:23.520 --> 01:26:25.780]
this program, letting you know that these people are out there.

[01:26:25.820 --> 01:26:26.700]
Even though you didn't hear that one.

[01:26:26.740 --> 01:26:27.540]
It was not a big deal.

[01:26:27.820 --> 01:26:31.200]
Just a mindless faceless voice.

[01:26:32.420 --> 01:26:32.780]
Dullesville.

[01:26:34.760 --> 01:26:35.460]
Here's plantation.

[01:26:35.740 --> 01:26:35.920]
Hello.

[01:26:37.720 --> 01:26:38.700]
Oh, that me, I'm sorry.

[01:26:39.920 --> 01:26:40.420]
Can you hear me?

[01:26:40.940 --> 01:26:47.120]
I beg your pardon. Is this a mobile implantation you talking to? Yes sir. Oh cool. What's up? Hey, what about that show?

[01:26:47.220 --> 01:26:48.080]
Undress on MTV

[01:26:49.520 --> 01:26:55.040]
Undress no, it's not a reality show. What is that? I thought it was soap opera. Oh, oh, they

[01:26:55.640 --> 01:27:00.900]
Okay, we'll move on then. I'm sorry. Nice try, pal. Bye. Bye. See you. Bye. Bye. Bye

[01:27:01.360 --> 01:27:04.340]
But I don't get hostile with him. He thought it was a reality show

[01:27:05.380 --> 01:27:08.420]
Now you're getting just as hostile as they are. You're gonna love George next week

[01:27:08.420 --> 01:27:11.480]
He's gonna be real hostile anti social hostile

[01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:16.240]
We're gonna apply for his anti social security. I'm gonna be some old night for next week

[01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:22.120]
Yeah, get out the big ship for next week. Oh, that's gonna be really good. I saw it. Oh, I can I can hear it now

[01:27:25.580 --> 01:27:28.120]
Jorge fills in for the pipe smoke of this morning at nine o'clock

[01:27:28.120 --> 01:27:32.820]
You know when you used to tell me that I guess I was an Amsterdam when he started doing that last summer with that pipe smoker business

[01:27:32.820 --> 01:27:39.560]
And I see I sometimes it's hard to separate his voice the reality like that fact said from the vocal Brian bits

[01:27:39.560 --> 01:27:44.840]
But the fact that he actually was saying that Jorge fills in for the pipe smoke of this morning at nine o'clock

[01:27:44.840 --> 01:27:48.080]
I mean this man is so terminally homophobic that that's all he knows

[01:27:48.080 --> 01:27:50.380]
Like a lot of the people in the audience. That's his only comeback

[01:27:50.380 --> 01:27:55.500]
You know, and this is come back and using these archaic terms for it to like pipe smoker

[01:27:55.500 --> 01:28:00.300]
Who now I never even heard of that until you started telling me about this the pipe smoker in the 1900s

[01:28:00.300 --> 01:28:04.640]
I think that's the term they used in fact maybe that should be the name of my show the pipe smoker program

[01:28:05.460 --> 01:28:07.360]
The three P's I smoke a pipe

[01:28:08.980 --> 01:28:11.160]
5 6 7 0 5 60

[01:28:11.160 --> 01:28:15.500]
man you are an old funny dutty mo and old funny dutty

[01:28:16.080 --> 01:28:18.200]
Trust me. No wonder he lives in bokeh

[01:28:19.380 --> 01:28:20.860]
Here's a call from Davy hello

[01:28:20.860 --> 01:28:26.560]
Hey, you know what's up long time. Yes sir. All right black man young black man and Davy

[01:28:26.560 --> 01:28:33.840]
I want to write excellent. That's what I'm talking about two things. Okay one real world put me down for that vote if you can

[01:28:33.840 --> 01:28:37.960]
Okay, two of these freedom fried things. I know you were talking about him yesterday

[01:28:37.960 --> 01:28:42.140]
I work at a place out in Daniel. I'm not gonna specify the name. We're working the cafeteria

[01:28:42.140 --> 01:28:48.100]
But yeah, my goodness. They they I've mentioned to them as a joke, you know, hey, let's change the French to freedom

[01:28:48.100 --> 01:28:52.120]
And they just go right along with it. I don't want to say Bama red neck. I don't want to say

[01:28:55.860 --> 01:28:56.220]
I

[01:28:56.860 --> 01:28:57.220]

I think what are you gonna do about it?

[01:32:00.120 --> 01:32:02.940]
Huh? It's my show. I'll do what I want.

[01:32:03.160 --> 01:32:06.240]
Just like I was telling that shrieman paint they called a rain.

[01:32:06.680 --> 01:32:07.800]
That's not nice.

[01:32:08.220 --> 01:32:09.620]
Ready and made not nice.

[01:32:09.980 --> 01:32:11.340]
You see the size of that broadened?

[01:32:11.560 --> 01:32:12.860]
Talk about jumpable.

[01:32:12.860 --> 01:32:15.240]
Somebody wants to paint yes or no on a race.

[01:32:15.520 --> 01:32:17.240]
I wish you know about promotions anyway.

[01:32:17.440 --> 01:32:20.440]

[01:32:22.780 --> 01:32:23.340]
Uh oh!

Yeah. I can smell the prince match him a belly.

[01:32:28.180 --> 01:32:31.720]
You have to go in the air and say those nasty things about me.

[01:32:32.640 --> 01:32:34.740]
Oh, there you come into my place of business.

[01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.360]
Don't you know we'll have like Elko a theater.

[01:32:37.360 --> 01:32:38.320]
I've had enough.

[01:32:38.600 --> 01:32:43.960]
You promised old dead rat hair paste wearing fossilized metal music filled motherless.

[01:32:43.980 --> 01:32:46.440]
I'll see here. That's all you're fired.

[01:32:47.100 --> 01:32:47.960]
Hey, you bastard.

[01:32:48.400 --> 01:32:49.460]
Don't come near me.

[01:32:49.760 --> 01:32:51.740]
Oh, I'm gonna cross the whole room.

[01:32:52.080 --> 01:32:53.120]
Don't put on his face.

[01:32:53.400 --> 01:32:54.580]
You're gonna crush him.

[01:32:55.320 --> 01:32:56.860]
And between my buns.

[01:32:57.580 --> 01:32:58.720]
I'm getting out of here.

[01:33:03.140 --> 01:33:03.940]
Get me.

[01:33:04.420 --> 01:33:06.620]
Yeah, I'm gonna get you a blast of pressure.

[01:33:07.360 --> 01:33:08.460]
It helps us.

[01:33:08.460 --> 01:33:08.460]

[01:33:08.460 --> 01:33:13.420]
Hi.

[01:33:13.420 --> 01:33:28.580]
4

[01:33:43.240 --> 01:33:50.760]
time-time slash are you hot? If you got it go do it again. Oh geez. Well no I hate to do this

[01:33:50.760 --> 01:33:54.120]
because your damn computer is so slow there and I'll host my internet access. I'll be

[01:33:54.120 --> 01:34:03.520]
learning now. No no seriously. Click that thing on again. I'm going. You got it? No. I click

[01:34:03.520 --> 01:34:09.240]
come on. How is that possible? You memory must have really suffered during that stroke.

[01:34:11.780 --> 01:34:17.400]
Don't tell me we've got a faulty bunch of crap down here huh? Come on let's get with it.

[01:34:18.920 --> 01:34:22.460]
Let's see you've been throwing it out there. No way that's all we don't be defecated anymore.

[01:34:22.580 --> 01:34:27.880]
You just you just out of control. What is with these people? Go away. I just wanted him to hear it

[01:34:27.880 --> 01:34:32.440]
from you. That's why you don't have to do it. Let me ask you this question. Yeah. If you like a

[01:34:32.440 --> 01:34:38.840]
program, see not sure if you like a program, what's wrong with this concept? Listen to it. Enjoy it,

[01:34:38.840 --> 01:34:45.140]
save it, squeeze it. Yank it. Well what's wrong with that? No no. Why do you have to keep

[01:34:45.140 --> 01:34:49.340]
faxing me? I don't want to see your scrolling crap the way when Paul you make me nauseous. Okay.

[01:34:49.600 --> 01:34:54.920]
I can't stand you. So that's my fault. Have you got this? Yeah. I got it on there. Okay you see

[01:34:54.920 --> 01:35:00.740]
where it says the hot gallery? Right. Click that on. Okay. Well no. First guy Kevin from Illinois that's

[01:35:00.740 --> 01:35:08.780]
got the bad teeth. You said he had bad teeth? Yes. Okay. There's Kerry. She's okay. She's a little

[01:35:08.780 --> 01:35:15.140]
scary. She's all right. I give her about nine. Wouldn't you? Okay. I don't have that up yet.

[01:35:16.240 --> 01:35:20.620]
What are you talking about? I clicked it. It's low. You should be able to flip through these like

[01:35:21.020 --> 01:35:25.560]
flatsaxes, man. Like Dr. Gupta's pedaling and flatsaxes and waffles on certainly not news network.

[01:35:26.300 --> 01:35:30.260]
Then you got me. Let me be coming up now. Lisa, what are you talking about?

[01:35:32.040 --> 01:35:38.640]
I'm. I'm traveling like that. It's nobody who does. Click it on next. I can't get the hot gallery out.

[01:35:42.040 --> 01:35:46.420]
And anyway after Travis, I'm sure some people in the audience are following along. There's Kevin from

[01:35:46.420 --> 01:35:52.960]
Weston, Florida, who's 18. He's a club promoter and he's a you know the point I was trying to make

[01:35:52.960 --> 01:35:58.260]
beside the fact that he's not only I give him about a 42 on a scale of 10. If he isn't an

[01:35:58.260 --> 01:36:04.760]
identical twin to Tony Dow with a great with a great body, huh? A little gay banter here now. I

[01:36:04.760 --> 01:36:08.420]
mean, he looks like Tony Dow's twin brother. Are you? Tony Dow look, I remember it from this morning.

[01:36:08.520 --> 01:36:12.000]
I'm getting this. I'm running low on virtual memory. I can't do anything. I say how about you,

[01:36:12.080 --> 01:36:16.980]
Carlos? Can you get on this? What's the website? I forget about it. Just forget it.

[01:36:18.320 --> 01:36:25.000]
This is Kevin from Weston, Florida, a local boy. He was a zone two finalist and semi final,

[01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:29.520]
whatever that means. I don't know what that means. He's a club promoter and he looks like Tony Dow's

[01:36:29.520 --> 01:36:35.360]
twin brother with a great body. It's all I can say. Just mention that in passing. Stars, noisy

[01:36:35.360 --> 01:36:41.220]
sex needles, neighbors, sexy Jennifer Esposito's, Esposito's mating call has her big apples,

[01:36:41.360 --> 01:36:46.660]
neighbors, howling. Seems that the spin city bombshell is making so much noise in bed that the board

[01:36:46.660 --> 01:36:50.020]
in her East Village co-op is threatening legal action if she doesn't put a sock in it.

[01:36:51.220 --> 01:36:55.600]
And I'm done with she's putting something else in it. We've asked her several times to insulate

[01:36:55.600 --> 01:36:59.760]
her apartment so we don't have to hear all that's going on. One neighbor complains when she has

[01:36:59.760 --> 01:37:05.460]
visitors, it's clearly heard. How do you like that? Talking about being a wild...

[01:37:07.480 --> 01:37:14.540]
...and it's the 31st summer of Sam's Star when I'm really into somebody I give so much.

[01:37:15.900 --> 01:37:22.540]
Esposito has been romantic with all my children, Hunk, Cameron Mathison, Angelina Jolie's ex-husband

[01:37:22.540 --> 01:37:27.940]
Johnny Lee Miller, model restaurant to her Christchurch and most recently Jato's ex-Christ Judd.

[01:37:31.020 --> 01:37:35.620]
Rhymes with Crud. Her spokesperson insists that Esposito's been too busy in California to

[01:37:35.620 --> 01:37:38.700]
have bothered the neighbors for the past year but board members are demanding that she

[01:37:38.700 --> 01:37:42.700]
crumple at least 80% of her apartment to cut down on the sound effects which not only include

[01:37:42.700 --> 01:37:47.460]
her bedroom or areas but also her screaming at her dog Frankie Bean and blasting,

[01:37:47.660 --> 01:37:52.220]
deafening techno music says the neighbor we know more about her life than we care to.

[01:37:54.540 --> 01:37:56.220]
But she gives her all she said,

[01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:58.060]
Welcome. How do you like that?

[01:37:59.520 --> 01:38:04.300]
I'm pissed off. Huh? This thing won't open, it won't go anywhere. I'm going to have to reset the

[01:38:04.300 --> 01:38:07.880]
computer. There's some good looking people on that thing. That's what I'm trying to tell you,

[01:38:07.920 --> 01:38:11.920]
it was a great show last night and obviously I'm the only one at the sod. I saw it and George

[01:38:11.920 --> 01:38:16.660]
were the only two people at sod. What's her name? Why don't you give me your name? Jennifer Jessica?

[01:38:16.660 --> 01:38:21.940]
No, that's not Rachel. Rachel. Rachel. Rachel was a sweetheart. She was beautiful.

[01:38:22.720 --> 01:38:25.880]
I'm telling you, there were like a half a dozen people on that show last night that there is

[01:38:25.880 --> 01:38:29.620]
almost nobody in this audience that wouldn't have said, oh, and you know another thing I do like

[01:38:29.620 --> 01:38:33.860]
about that show? Sat. Now you're telling me that the one guy which we don't know who he is,

[01:38:33.860 --> 01:38:38.000]
the one judge he's gay. I don't know what he is. Yeah. And then you got Lorenzo Lamas,

[01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:41.580]
who's obviously a real lady. And then he's not gay. Right. You may be may not like him.

[01:38:41.920 --> 01:38:46.060]
And then of course, what's your name there in the middle? Rachel. Rachel Sumpenter.

[01:38:46.660 --> 01:38:51.420]
Is that it? You'd like to. Yes, I would. But in any way, the point I'm trying to make is it

[01:38:51.420 --> 01:38:55.220]
doesn't make any difference whether it's the guys or the chicks, but they all, these far ones saying

[01:38:55.220 --> 01:38:58.680]
in other words, they're not looking at it from this. Oh, gee, if I say something good about the guy,

[01:38:58.680 --> 01:39:02.800]
I'm gonna throw the bag. You know, that whole uptight thing like most of our small audience is that tight.

[01:39:03.060 --> 01:39:07.440]
No, no, they just, you know, they, in other words, I think that's a real step in a right direction

[01:39:07.440 --> 01:39:10.880]
for television. In other words, I can look at a human being and say, hey, there's somebody

[01:39:10.880 --> 01:39:14.940]
looks really good. That doesn't mean I want to hop on their bones necessarily. Or maybe I do,

[01:39:14.940 --> 01:39:20.200]
who knows, but that's the whole different subject. And I think that's a breath of some kind of air.

[01:39:20.620 --> 01:39:24.460]
You know what I mean? Yeah. Here's West Palm Beach. Hello.

[01:39:25.240 --> 01:39:30.380]
You know, yes, sir. Uh, remember last week when Bush had his press conference and there was

[01:39:30.380 --> 01:39:36.820]
some speculation about whether he was medicated, you know, more endowed even mentioning it. Yeah.

[01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:44.340]
In her column. Well, when he was on about an hour ago, he was talking like in a total monotone.

[01:39:44.340 --> 01:39:47.700]
Yeah, I put a few seconds of it on. I almost fell asleep. I had to get it off.

[01:39:47.920 --> 01:39:52.560]
Well, he just had this blank look in a total monotone. I'm wondering.

[01:39:52.620 --> 01:39:56.820]
The least he's consistent. Yeah. Well, that's true. And you know, see a colon there to prop him up.

[01:39:56.980 --> 01:40:02.680]
Right. Well, wasn't his father taking some kind of, uh, mood drug back then?

[01:40:02.680 --> 01:40:07.740]
I think he started doing that after he puked in Japan after he puked all over the Japanese Prime Minister.

[01:40:07.820 --> 01:40:12.180]
I think he started taking some crap. Yeah, that could be. Well, you know, God is, uh,

[01:40:12.180 --> 01:40:16.400]
you know, guiding everything W does. That's right. He's guiding his hand.

[01:40:16.840 --> 01:40:19.340]
Have you noticed how he's sticking it right up our back?

[01:40:19.420 --> 01:40:25.800]
Um, have you noticed how a fundamentalism and right wing politics go hand in hand?

[01:40:26.680 --> 01:40:31.840]
I mean, like you really never see a left-winger that's a fundamentalist Christian.

[01:40:32.260 --> 01:40:35.160]
No, if you never see left-wingers pushing religion, at least I don't.

[01:40:35.200 --> 01:40:38.580]
Right. Trying to, you know, with the, well, what it amounts to, right-wingers are

[01:40:38.580 --> 01:40:42.440]
intolerant. They want to tell everybody else what to think, what how to do, and, and everybody

[01:40:42.440 --> 01:40:47.120]
must think like them. Everybody must have to and go step like them. And that's what, that's become

[01:40:47.120 --> 01:40:51.180]
all about. We have, we have the Democrat Party, which is the impotent party, totally impotent.

[01:40:51.360 --> 01:40:54.260]
And we have the Republican Party, which is now the right-wing, uh, fascist party,

[01:40:54.640 --> 01:40:58.140]
taking over about much religious zealots. And, and there's nothing left in between for the masses,

[01:40:58.140 --> 01:41:02.520]
which is most everybody. There's nothing in between. Well, you know, you've, you've talked about how,

[01:41:02.700 --> 01:41:07.380]
you know, all the stuff that was written down in the Bible, who knows what went on then. But,

[01:41:07.380 --> 01:41:13.520]
look, look at the Mormon church. We know everything about the origins of that church. We know the,

[01:41:13.720 --> 01:41:19.040]
most of the documents are fake. We know, uh, Joseph, don't be knocking Joseph Smith now. He's

[01:41:19.040 --> 01:41:24.820]
with Pell Mareboy. He was a con man. Good upstate New York con. Uh, uh, yeah. He was a convicted

[01:41:24.820 --> 01:41:30.900]
con man. And yet you still have people like in Baker? Yeah, exactly. You never gonna have a great

[01:41:30.900 --> 01:41:35.100]
day. Okay. Okay. Good call, but I mean, just now we're starting to snooze off a little bit. You

[01:41:35.100 --> 01:41:41.300]
know what I'm saying? What? Five, six, seven, oh, five, 60 pound, five, 60 on a AT&T and Verizon.

[01:41:41.540 --> 01:41:44.480]
See with me. I mean, when you're preaching to the choir, I don't want to keep repeating this and

[01:41:44.480 --> 01:41:47.880]
rehashing that same stuff over and over again. What's the point? You know where I stand? You know

[01:41:47.880 --> 01:41:52.840]
where we sit. And that's it. Right? Right. On what's the point of continuing to hash? I gave you all

[01:41:52.840 --> 01:41:56.520]
the books. In fact, we ought to put those two books both on our website, Carlos. Can you handle

[01:41:56.520 --> 01:42:01.940]
that or should we wait till next week? Well, I can tell you Eric about it. Well, that's what I'm

[01:42:01.940 --> 01:42:08.160]
talking about. Now don't start, you know, don't start again. Gore-Vidal, perpetual war for perpetual

[01:42:08.160 --> 01:42:14.360]
peace. How we got to be so hated. And the hunting of the president, the 10-year campaign to

[01:42:14.360 --> 01:42:21.500]
destroy a villain Hillary Clinton by Joe Connison and Gene Lyons. You got it? Got it. Oh, that was

[01:42:21.500 --> 01:42:27.040]
delicious. Hmm. What was it? That was like a peppermint flavored grips. And I haven't eaten, I can

[01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:30.820]
don't eat peppermint. I don't know what that was. To finish. You maybe swallow. There's Tony Blair.

[01:42:31.240 --> 01:42:38.560]
Can now result in the emergence of an independent, democratic and viable Palestinian state,

[01:42:39.120 --> 01:42:45.600]
living side by side in peace and security. Isn't this amazing that just an hour ago,

[01:42:45.700 --> 01:42:49.840]
the president and Roland Coulden were on their together talking the very same topic about how we

[01:42:49.840 --> 01:42:53.620]
got to get this middle east peace process going again. We got to have a Palestinian state. And

[01:42:53.620 --> 01:42:58.360]
here's Tony Blair. It's like he's got a puppet in his pocket. We think they call each other.

[01:42:58.500 --> 01:43:02.960]
Very much. First. You're welcome, Tony. You're out, Tony. You're done. You're dead meat sweet.

Well, at least Are You Hot's moving up a little bit, you know on a Richter scale?

[01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:53.860]
It's good. They checked out that website. Maybe they'll watch it next Thursday night.

[01:45:54.840 --> 01:46:00.580]

[01:46:09.960 --> 01:46:14.720]
the mole meet my folks, the bachelor and the rest have either one or the big. A lot of them still have none.

[01:46:16.420 --> 01:46:22.020]
Just amazes me. What is it that our audience watches? What do they watch? Besides the WWF, they watch.

[01:46:25.920 --> 01:46:30.720]
You know something I think you just hit it. For years we've been looking for the big hit show

[01:46:30.720 --> 01:46:35.620]
that's a that can't miss right. Gears specifically toward the self-port audios, a show called

[01:46:35.620 --> 01:46:40.680]
We know how you smell it. We're as soon as we figure out how you smell it. We just have we just

[01:46:40.680 --> 01:46:47.460]
have a bunch of angry looking people sitting around going. Yeah, what do you hate? What do you hate?

[01:46:47.460 --> 01:46:49.600]
What do you hate? It's a hit. Sure. It's a hit.

[01:46:49.700 --> 01:46:59.340]
I'm a mad at hell. I think it's perfect. Here's a call from a Miami Beach. Hello.

[01:47:01.340 --> 01:47:12.160]
Yes, sir. I just received my email of you amusing quotes. I thought I'd like to share with you about

[01:47:12.160 --> 01:47:15.920]
the frame. About what? About the frame. Thank you. No, thank you.

[01:47:17.480 --> 01:47:20.760]
Carlos, if you put it in realize we're not getting like a zillion calls today, but if you put

[01:47:20.760 --> 01:47:25.240]
it in more 400-year-old people, you're not going to live to be like 30. You know what I'm saying?

[01:47:26.480 --> 01:47:27.780]
Don't be doing it, Jack.

[01:47:31.340 --> 01:47:35.060]
Hey, Hans, speaking of Jack, is would you call that a reality show? No.

[01:47:35.660 --> 01:47:40.820]
What would you call it? Those are all, uh, I'm trying. Members of a staff and then it's all set up

[01:47:40.820 --> 01:47:44.540]
and, you know, they do stuff. I see. Oh, the reality show is when the kids emulated and tried to do

[01:47:44.540 --> 01:47:49.140]
what they get killed in the acrylic, which is actually funny, by the way. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60,

[01:47:49.300 --> 01:47:54.760]
pound 5, 60. I have a list of... I'm telling you, man, we're starting to get the Randy Rose crowd.

[01:47:54.920 --> 01:47:59.020]
Wow. Yeah, see that? The old person we had yesterday, that's scary to me.

[01:47:59.700 --> 01:48:05.120]
When we got 6.9% of this audience who listens to the goddess, like her ranting and raving about how

[01:48:05.120 --> 01:48:09.020]
she's going to save the world from the clutches of right-wing fascism, I got news for her, man. We

[01:48:09.020 --> 01:48:14.200]
got tourists here on the station and I got news for you too, Mozo. We need those 7,500 billboards.

[01:48:14.460 --> 01:48:17.780]
And what we're going to do all next week is George's is going to read the addresses over and over again.

[01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:22.280]
Right. And also continue going back and poking the lights out on yours so nobody can see it at night.

[01:48:22.600 --> 01:48:26.660]
Well, we got, you know, phones. I got a cell phone. And in addition, what's he worried about people

[01:48:26.660 --> 01:48:30.780]
seeing it at night when it's dark out because his audience has passed their bedtime anyway when it

[01:48:30.780 --> 01:48:38.720]
gets dark now? Follow what I'm saying. Come on. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T and for

[01:48:38.720 --> 01:48:43.160]
rise in line. Let's see if we can get somebody a little younger on this next call. North Miami. Hello.

[01:48:44.240 --> 01:48:47.580]
Hello. Yes, sir. Neil. Are you under the age of 100?

[01:48:48.440 --> 01:48:54.520]
41. Good. All right. Perfect. Neil, I saw that hot, that hot or not show. And now that actually,

[01:48:54.520 --> 01:48:58.980]
there was some good look at people in that show. That's my point. There were some beautiful people on that show.

[01:48:59.620 --> 01:49:07.680]
Even the guys and I'm a breeder. Yeah. Listen, I called you about five years ago. And I was grabbing on 95

[01:49:07.680 --> 01:49:12.720]
and in a testament to your divine powers. You were talking about the Bobby Materials Stadium.

[01:49:13.180 --> 01:49:16.700]
Do you remember that? And I look over on the 95 and there it is. Unfire.

[01:49:17.460 --> 01:49:22.920]
Right. I remember that. Listen, Neil, I want to keep going to mess with me.

[01:49:23.660 --> 01:49:26.920]
That's right. That's right. If I was you, I'd keep my eye on most billboard.

[01:49:28.080 --> 01:49:34.200]
You know, I don't even know who Mo is. Good. Listen, Neil, I want to make a comment about the

[01:49:34.200 --> 01:49:37.860]
visitors that we get. I remember about a year and a half. I remember that call about two months

[01:49:37.860 --> 01:49:44.900]
ago where the Fox, the Fox lady called in about kind of Lisa. Yeah. And I barely caught that. And,

[01:49:44.900 --> 01:49:50.940]
you know, everyone, everyone always accused of your show of being racist and yet, yet, yet, and I remember.

[01:49:50.940 --> 01:49:56.680]
No, they don't. Wait a minute. No, not everyone. Fox News Heather and John Gibson and Mo Howard

[01:49:56.680 --> 01:50:00.960]
David and a couple of other people. Nobody else has ever accused this of being a racist show,

[01:50:01.060 --> 01:50:05.640]
including the listening audience. Nobody's ever said that. No, I remember back in the days when you

[01:50:05.640 --> 01:50:10.860]
were on W on O D and, you know, I remember that you're making guy calling you up and rooting out saying how,

[01:50:10.860 --> 01:50:17.200]
you know, you guys, you'll pick on the football players, the black guys, but it's Patrick kicking the

[01:50:17.200 --> 01:50:24.100]
snout out of his pregnant wife was okay. But that's one guy. That's one guy. I agree. But his

[01:50:24.100 --> 01:50:29.040]
part was well taken. You know, but I just want to just want to make a comment about, you know, the

[01:50:29.040 --> 01:50:33.360]
moral day weekend and the visitors we have now and all these F-50 heads that are coming in for the

[01:50:33.360 --> 01:50:38.340]
winner of musical festival, you know, and everything else. And to be honest with you, about a year and

[01:50:38.340 --> 01:50:43.640]
half ago when this whole thing exploded, my moral day weekend and I live on top beach. And I'll be

[01:50:43.640 --> 01:50:50.640]
honest with you, these people didn't create the chaos that you portrayed on your radio show. And I

[01:50:50.640 --> 01:50:54.100]
know that there's people calling in from Davey that never been a top beach in a life. But I can't

[01:50:54.100 --> 01:50:58.680]
tell his monkey's out of here in the tonight. And I didn't see it, man. I see a lot worse things

[01:50:58.680 --> 01:51:03.500]
with a white party this week, the spring break. It's year round here. You know, it's not just the

[01:51:03.500 --> 01:51:09.300]
moral day. Yeah, that's my two cents. Okay. All right. That's right. Thank you. What did he say?

[01:51:09.580 --> 01:51:16.660]
He said I'm a racist five six seven oh five 60 pound five 60 see this is the last desperate gas. You

[01:51:16.660 --> 01:51:20.900]
see everything else that they tried to Catholic church, the fact thing, everything else didn't work.

[01:51:21.100 --> 01:51:25.280]
So now wow, he's a racist. See, play that condolence and have their restitution. So that didn't work

[01:51:25.280 --> 01:51:27.340]
either. Didn't work.

[01:51:30.300 --> 01:51:33.820]
Desperate. You want to read some of those right wing websites, man? You just you either laugh or

[01:51:33.820 --> 01:51:38.280]
cry some of the crap that they write. These are the most paranoid delusional people on the face of

[01:51:38.280 --> 01:51:42.120]
the globe. The only problem is that a bunch of them are running the country now. That's the sad part.

[01:51:43.300 --> 01:51:50.940]
And boy, talk about a bunch of red, necky gun, totten, flag, waven, right wing. And these people are

[01:51:51.480 --> 01:51:57.060]
civil rights workers. Who now are they kidding? Huh? These are the same people who like to shove

[01:51:57.060 --> 01:52:00.880]
Rosa Parks back to the back of the bus. And by the way, the guy that called him with that Rosa

[01:52:00.880 --> 01:52:04.220]
Parks deal that day on a poll about who's going to croak next, he wouldn't fool anybody.

[01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:09.760]
Well, my work is complete. My work is done. What was the name of that? So my work,

[01:52:09.960 --> 01:52:13.940]
you know, it's sad. It's just pathetic. You don't know whether to laugh or cry with these people

[01:52:14.780 --> 01:52:18.420]
because nobody is permitted to go on a year and express themselves. And especially now that we

[01:52:18.420 --> 01:52:27.040]
got Michael Powell, the son of a colon rolling as the chairman of the FCC. Well, we're going to

[01:52:27.040 --> 01:52:33.020]
call Powell, okay? And your whole FCC screw your ass. You piece of crap. Once more deregulation,

[01:52:33.280 --> 01:52:36.500]
once the chief channel and one or two other companies own every goddamn radio station,

[01:52:36.820 --> 01:52:41.240]
every TV station, every freaking newspaper. In fact, why don't we just like Rupert Murdoch

[01:52:41.240 --> 01:52:46.120]
on them all? How's that sound? Sure. And you talk about a freaking hypocrite, man. Although,

[01:52:46.460 --> 01:52:51.220]
I mean, talk about a genius. Yeah. We talked about this a few days ago. On the one hand, he's got the

[01:52:51.220 --> 01:52:56.100]
Fox entertainment network that brings in all of this money, the young demographics and brings in a ton

[01:52:56.100 --> 01:53:01.420]
of money with everything cutting edge, pushing the envelope as far as he possibly can. And on the

[01:53:01.420 --> 01:53:05.380]
other hand, raking in all of those big bucks from the advertising on a Fox entertainment. So he's

[01:53:05.380 --> 01:53:11.720]
going on his fascist news network, all spin all day, all right, wing lies all day, all crap all day.

[01:53:12.040 --> 01:53:18.780]
I'm going to do it. And the insane. Pretty clever. And pretty dangerous.

[01:53:19.720 --> 01:53:27.480]
26 after 11 at 560 WQM 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line. Haven't even

[01:53:27.480 --> 01:53:31.960]
gotten to our story about Sydney fears dad's explosions and wants to move. OJ daughter trapped in a house

[01:53:31.960 --> 01:53:38.180]
of pain. Oi, we will get to it. Maybe and maybe not, you know, maybe not. This thing's flying along

[01:53:38.180 --> 01:53:43.680]
today. Here it is almost 11 30 already, George. Tom layman and Joe Prieto, Halle, Pontiac GMC are

[01:53:43.680 --> 01:53:47.780]

[01:58:28.260 --> 01:58:32.880]
anti-American sentiment that's unfolded there is astounding while we support our troops there's

[01:58:32.880 --> 01:58:36.900]
nothing more frightening than notion going to war with Iraq and the prospect of all the innocent

[01:58:36.900 --> 01:58:42.920]
lives will be lost they said in a separate statement Thursday Maine said I feel the president is

[01:58:42.920 --> 01:58:47.020]
ignoring the opinion of many in the West and alienating the rest of the world my comments were made

falling leaves man these deluded people here they're all talking Stanley Cup they're in

[01:59:54.860 --> 01:59:59.880]
they're on drugs they're on crack go ahead what did you think of the Valerie Burray trade

[02:00:00.700 --> 02:00:05.480]
wait what do you mean I think of it it's it wasn't a trade it was just unloading salary it was

[02:00:05.480 --> 02:00:10.180]
what they keep doing do you know anything about the guy you got though no I know anybody ever

[02:00:10.180 --> 02:00:14.800]
raised just another kid he's just another prospect not just another kid he actually had a great

[02:00:14.800 --> 02:00:19.940]
rookie year last year he didn't make it we think Louis this year because the problem was

[02:00:20.400 --> 02:00:26.560]
his great rookie year was in direct uh research sure let me say this to you let me say this to you

[02:00:26.560 --> 02:00:31.460]
right now can I say something to you they unloaded salary and the fact is they can have all these

[02:00:31.460 --> 02:00:36.220]
promising youngsters for as long as they want but if they're going to continue not using the money

[02:00:36.220 --> 02:00:40.860]
from Pavel Burray salary and Valerie Burray salary everybody else that they dumped out of there

[02:00:40.860 --> 02:00:45.400]
they're they're going to continue to be nothing but years of frustration net franchises in big big

[02:00:45.400 --> 02:00:50.220]
trouble they've got the nucleus of what could be a really good team if they had if they had some

[02:00:50.220 --> 02:00:53.500]
federal guys in there how would you like to still have Ray Whitney and Mike Sonser and Scott

[02:00:53.500 --> 02:00:58.220]
Melonby on the team Scott Melonby who scored four goals in the one game last week I understand that

[02:00:58.220 --> 02:01:03.000]
I'm a huge blue fan well I'm just telling you they they've they've got to the team you know

[02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:07.560]
and you couldn't have a bunch of of underpaid huh one of the guys you didn't even mention with

[02:01:07.560 --> 02:01:12.840]
two wives that takes two wives that's ancient history I mean people that want to keep talking about

[02:01:12.840 --> 02:01:16.880]
that that's ancient history but I'm just talking about it in the last year and a half or two years

[02:01:16.880 --> 02:01:24.900]
right here's my other question why is it that seems like New Jersey and Detroit always are able to

[02:01:24.900 --> 02:01:29.200]
make great deals with the trade deadlines don't these other organizations get tired of it like the

[02:01:29.200 --> 02:01:34.520]
fans do I mean how does Detroit get Matthew Schneider's trade deadline I don't like Matthew Schneider I

[02:01:34.520 --> 02:01:39.220]
think he's highly overrated but I'd rather have Matthew Schneider than Phil Howesley was 100

[02:01:39.220 --> 02:01:42.920]
years old but because Detroit is willing to spend the money they fill that place every night they

[02:01:42.920 --> 02:01:48.840]
make a fortune they got a ton of money and that's why they do it it's like it's like it's like the

[02:01:48.840 --> 02:01:52.360]
Rangers now who are still within shouting distance of making it because they got a $75 million

[02:01:52.360 --> 02:01:56.480]
payroll you realize the Panthers payroll is the third or fourth lowest in league it's $23 million

[02:01:56.480 --> 02:02:01.440]
dollars fine out the joke even even the Buffalo Sabers who are just being bought thank God to save

[02:02:01.440 --> 02:02:04.660]
them out through the deals going through and out of the sale but even the Sabers who've got a bigger

[02:02:04.660 --> 02:02:09.080]
payroll in the Panthers how do you compete when you're not paying anybody when you're not bringing

[02:02:09.080 --> 02:02:13.280]
in any asses in the seats this group man Alan Cohen and his buddies you know they may have meant

[02:02:13.280 --> 02:02:17.680]
meant the best but they had no clue what they were getting into they have no idea what they're doing

[02:02:17.680 --> 02:02:22.600]
now I mean I've only been down to maybe a dozen games this year but it's still the same

[02:02:22.600 --> 02:02:26.320]
thing I mean people want to get paid they yeah I had a call the other day oh you're wrong the

[02:02:26.320 --> 02:02:30.320]
other it was a good crowd for the Montreal game there weren't 4,000 people there for that game I'm

[02:02:30.320 --> 02:02:37.620]
like no seriously I saw the telecast here on TSN okay on the sports network and they panned and

[02:02:37.620 --> 02:02:41.760]
they were talking about how this this place isn't drawing any people in the Florida franchises got

[02:02:41.760 --> 02:02:45.560]
to get some asses in the seats they pan back and show that arena in the middle of the first period

[02:02:45.560 --> 02:02:51.100]
if there were 4,000 people there my name is Danny Galavan okay and of the 4,000 maybe a hundred new

[02:02:51.100 --> 02:02:55.960]
anything about the game well that's beside the point but you know they still got to get the cash

[02:02:55.960 --> 02:02:58.940]
man they got to get some asses in the seats and they're not going to do it by missing the playoffs

[02:02:58.940 --> 02:03:04.640]
every year right what a good question yes sir do you think Chris Osgood can do anything at this point

[02:03:04.640 --> 02:03:09.060]
in this career I don't I don't I think he gets a bum rap I don't think he's all that bad I think

[02:03:09.060 --> 02:03:14.340]
he he want to stand like couple of red wings exactly I think that was I think that was a good

[02:03:14.340 --> 02:03:18.120]
deal in addition to which they Sean Brook wanted to hold him up for big bucks Sean Burke is yeah

[02:03:18.120 --> 02:03:23.380]
I don't I think he's overrated oh and Phoenix was demanding all kinds of exactly I think I think

[02:03:23.380 --> 02:03:29.660]
they did good yeah okay good luck to pal good luck to the Leafs we'll need it Doug Gilmore seven

[02:03:29.660 --> 02:03:35.440]
shifts but I'm being bye bye Dougie and I see you again remember 93 got wiped out by old Dave

[02:03:35.440 --> 02:03:39.880]
Lowry not only scored a goal last night for Calgary but wiped out Doug Gilmore in the same game

[02:03:40.680 --> 02:03:47.100]
that's for you Dave you following all of this what little hockey talk that's okay that was good

[02:03:47.100 --> 02:03:51.220]

the first time aggressor nation and the only one that's growing now more blood will be

[02:30:25.210 --> 02:30:34.090]
to get that oil going forget about the ryan the nooks there talking that the right wing is

[02:30:34.110 --> 02:30:44.930]
really it over and over into our head that iraq has some weapons of mass destruction

[02:30:55.950 --> 02:30:56.830]
and

[02:30:56.830 --> 02:31:01.810]
3000 people killed are now forgotten let's exploit them instead

[02:31:01.810 --> 02:31:09.610]
a there's oil to be gone and going after sent down to plain kato sum up there's no longer

[02:31:09.610 --> 02:31:17.590]
mention of the name in law that but no one seemed concerned all come be in complacent believe in

[02:31:17.590 --> 02:31:25.510]
every word of this cartel administration that controls us by fear through media manipulation and the

[02:31:25.510 --> 02:31:36.710]
right wing is really it over and over and over to our heads that iraq has some weapons of

[02:31:45.250 --> 02:31:46.030]
mass destruction

[02:31:48.230 --> 02:31:55.770]
the law for civil rights is the rights that we're paying we're all suspects now not the

[02:31:55.770 --> 02:32:02.210]
ash drop this saying i have nothing to hide table talkers all are say it's like no

[02:32:09.730 --> 02:32:15.750]
old ryan must fall it's how the virgin is told with no objection at all

[02:32:15.750 --> 02:32:22.810]
and the craft don't have the balls and the right wing is really it over and over

[02:32:22.810 --> 02:32:31.230]
and over to our brain wash man iraq has some weapons of mass destruction

[02:32:32.890 --> 02:32:39.530]
you're told the i'd racked that son with the mass destruction

[02:32:45.150 --> 02:32:49.410]
we sure do from 19 at five six you know it's not interesting that we had these two

[02:32:49.410 --> 02:32:54.090]
faces back to back and here's what it says i'm puzzled i heard hangs trying to get the beast

[02:32:54.090 --> 02:32:58.030]
to date for some contest now i love Hank is a taco snail and the beast looks like his son

[02:32:58.030 --> 02:33:01.210]
but when's the last date Hank had they didn't pay for it why it's none of your business

[02:33:01.910 --> 02:33:05.150]
here's what it says haven't heard anything lately about the beast getting laid in the Baham as well

[02:33:05.150 --> 02:33:08.590]
that is a good point now do we just smith hand that promotion it's still on their website

[02:33:08.590 --> 02:33:13.550]
qm dot com still going on and will go on well how can we don't hear any more promos for it

[02:33:14.090 --> 02:33:18.610]
ii on our on our show yeah because we don't want to make a five minute break

[02:33:19.150 --> 02:33:22.510]

[02:33:50.430 --> 02:33:53.870]
this that you're fixing me now at this stage of the game yeah that's my fault he gave it to me

[02:33:58.290 --> 02:34:03.670]
uh picture of the new billboard on one twelve go to the my main international and it looks just

[02:34:03.670 --> 02:34:10.070]
like me on earth says uh yeah good nine to one five sixty wq amp oh yeah i'm a little bit

[02:34:10.070 --> 02:34:16.970]
leery of one thing on a billboards they look great but like on hanks it says the hammer three to

[02:34:16.970 --> 02:34:21.290]
seven you know what i mean i mean if anybody doesn't know that that's his nickname on a station

[02:34:21.290 --> 02:34:24.310]
and the day they have no idea that it's Hank Goldberg so you know what i'm saying right because

[02:34:24.310 --> 02:34:28.250]
hanks been around the market for a hundred years right they might think it's on sea hammer yeah right

[02:34:28.250 --> 02:34:33.330]
that's right market is kind of a different audience but i'm serious i mean i guarantee i

[02:34:33.330 --> 02:34:40.150]
hanks been on the station what about seven years on qa amp longer than us uh huh the six seven

[02:34:40.150 --> 02:34:45.370]
years whatever it's been and you know people know Hank Goldberg they know the name and like when

[02:34:45.370 --> 02:34:49.290]
he goes on the spn the i don't know because i don't think i've ever seen Hank on the spanish

[02:34:49.290 --> 02:34:54.370]
him on the abc thing with erasing but like they don't say oh well here's the hammer to talk about

[02:34:54.370 --> 02:34:59.310]

[02:36:28.650 --> 02:36:32.770]
middle east proposal now israel must support the Palestinian state and the Palestinians have to do

[02:36:32.770 --> 02:36:36.090]
this and about to be put a root put about and so isn't this interesting they should have been

[02:36:36.090 --> 02:36:39.930]
doing this like two years ago yeah wasn't uh bubbled doing that and you remember the comments

[02:36:39.930 --> 02:36:43.810]
we're not going to get bogged down in the middle east that the whole israeli Palestinian

[02:36:43.810 --> 02:36:47.710]
thing like the Clinton administration did we're not going to get bogged down you know we got bigger

[02:36:47.710 --> 02:36:52.870]
fish to fry like taking away everybody's civil rights and then all of a sudden nine eleven

[02:36:52.870 --> 02:36:57.110]
happened now all of the same isolationist bastards now all of a sudden their experts all over

[02:36:57.110 --> 02:37:02.070]
the world we're going to solve it and of course if they do see it seems to me because they told

[02:37:02.070 --> 02:37:09.750]
CBS news which i forgot to mention in a moment less less than of less than clarity they tell

[02:37:09.750 --> 02:37:15.490]
CBS news oh guess what um al-Qaeda is in total disarray in fact then rather had it on last night

[02:37:15.490 --> 02:37:21.110]
you see it on the CBS news yeah that al-Qaeda is basically beat but on the other hand in the same

[02:37:21.110 --> 02:37:25.090]
sentence they're saying uh wow but we know there's going to be another attack and they're going to

[02:37:25.090 --> 02:37:28.610]
kill a bunch of innocent people they just can't they just can't do what like they did before

[02:37:30.050 --> 02:37:34.630]
so in other words a bunch of double talk but if that's true and of course there are many other

[02:37:34.630 --> 02:37:38.790]
terrorist groups but if that's true since they were the main focus of our focus and if this

[02:37:38.790 --> 02:37:42.950]
middle east piecing is going to get that those are two more reasons not to be going into a

[02:37:42.950 --> 02:37:46.510]
rack see what i'm saying yeah and not to be stirring up the whole Muslim world again everybody

[02:37:46.510 --> 02:37:51.410]

Oh, what you're, oh oh

[02:44:09.770 --> 02:44:10.930]

Uhhhh

[02:44:19.430 --> 02:44:21.030]
Uhhhh

[02:44:21.030 --> 02:44:22.870]
Uhhhh

[02:44:22.870 --> 02:44:23.690]
Uhhhh

[02:44:23.690 --> 02:44:24.350]
Uhhhh

[02:44:26.170 --> 02:44:30.830]
You're so, oh

[02:44:30.830 --> 02:44:31.370]
Tell me

[02:44:48.250 --> 02:44:51.170]
I couldn't believe when you were telling me this before the show about his perm.

[02:44:52.030 --> 02:44:53.110]
I thought you were joking me.

[02:44:53.210 --> 02:44:54.830]
We were talking about the Are You Hot Show.

[02:44:55.510 --> 02:45:00.450]
But here it is from the A&P Howard Spurm has to see the producers of the series Are You

[02:45:00.450 --> 02:45:04.330]
Hot to Search for America's Sexiest People, claiming the show is based on ideas on his

[02:45:04.330 --> 02:45:05.110]
radio program.

[02:45:05.990 --> 02:45:09.230]
The lawsuit filed yesterday in Superior Court accused the network of copying unique

[02:45:09.230 --> 02:45:13.730]
aspects of a Stern Radio segment in which members of his crew ingest evaded the bodies

[02:45:13.730 --> 02:45:17.370]
of in-studio contestants, stern as seeking $100 million in damages.

[02:45:17.870 --> 02:45:23.570]
The 49-year-old radio personality claims ABC show duplicate some tactics used on his

[02:45:23.570 --> 02:45:27.590]
show, including blood criticism of contestants and the use of a laser pointer to highlight

[02:45:27.590 --> 02:45:30.670]
areas of their bodies, which I noticed that your body did it once last night.

[02:45:32.190 --> 02:45:37.170]
Are You Hot Features contestants in various stages of dress, mostly undress, posting

[02:45:37.170 --> 02:45:39.550]
in front of three panelists who rate them solely on looks?

[02:45:40.230 --> 02:45:44.390]
The show is produced by Scott Einsiger, former executive producer of Stern's ETH cable

[02:45:44.390 --> 02:45:50.410]
show, and former Stern's sidekick, Jackie Martlin, is listed as a consultant.

[02:45:51.530 --> 02:45:56.030]
Before ABC's program debuted, Stern was still in talks to develop a TV series based on

[02:45:56.030 --> 02:45:57.510]
his radio segment according to the lawsuit.

[02:45:57.510 --> 02:46:01.710]
He planned a broadcast to show possibly on a pay cable channel that wouldn't be subject

[02:46:01.710 --> 02:46:06.190]
to censorship, but when ABC aired Are You Hot Talks for a Stern TV show collapsed,

[02:46:06.450 --> 02:46:07.490]
the lawsuit would be sand.

[02:46:08.010 --> 02:46:11.270]
Stern says he warned the network to serve as a misappropriation, but ABC disregarded him,

[02:46:11.390 --> 02:46:12.350]
and now he stood for $100 million.

[02:46:12.750 --> 02:46:12.930]
Oh!

[02:46:13.550 --> 02:46:14.450]
Good luck to you Howard.

[02:46:14.610 --> 02:46:18.890]
Next he needs the Mark Honey for stealing his idea about radio, and then the first angle

[02:46:18.890 --> 02:46:20.750]
he's going to sue him for stealing English.

[02:46:21.330 --> 02:46:23.990]
Do you think that he needs the money or the publicity most?

[02:46:26.890 --> 02:46:30.610]
560-560 on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line, WKYM.

[02:46:30.830 --> 02:46:30.830]

[02:46:32.070 --> 02:46:32.510]
Hello.

[02:46:41.390 --> 02:46:41.530]
Yeah.

[02:46:42.810 --> 02:46:45.450]
I've been listening to the show for about 15 years.

[02:46:45.910 --> 02:46:46.150]
Uh huh.

[02:46:47.410 --> 02:46:49.670]
Now George is starting to get that laugh.

[02:46:49.930 --> 02:46:50.610]
You know that laugh?

[02:46:53.930 --> 02:46:54.530]
That's it.

[02:46:56.310 --> 02:46:56.410]
Yeah.

[02:46:56.970 --> 02:46:58.910]
You need to take care of George.

[02:46:59.090 --> 02:47:01.970]
Make sure he's like to lays off the laugh a little bit.

[02:47:02.230 --> 02:47:03.310]
You lay off the laugh George.

[02:47:03.970 --> 02:47:03.970]

[02:47:05.150 --> 02:47:06.330]
The other thing is Neil.

[02:47:06.850 --> 02:47:11.070]
I mean you've been lagging on a Canadian for years and years and years, and now you're off.

[02:47:11.090 --> 02:47:13.530]
The French Canadians, not the AC.

[02:47:13.530 --> 02:47:15.610]
You better know your Canadians Mr. Cause you sure don't.

[02:47:16.350 --> 02:47:17.650]
Yeah well I don't cause the...

[02:47:17.650 --> 02:47:20.170]
The French Canadians are in Quebec either in Montreal.

[02:47:20.170 --> 02:47:22.750]
We don't have no frogs here in Ontario and Toronto.

[02:47:23.330 --> 02:47:23.950]
Uh okay.

[02:47:24.290 --> 02:47:25.050]
Not allowed man.

[02:47:25.230 --> 02:47:26.310]
No say per Missy out key.

[02:47:26.790 --> 02:47:27.170]
Okay.

[02:47:27.730 --> 02:47:28.230]
Right in.

[02:47:28.590 --> 02:47:28.790]
Good.

[02:47:29.430 --> 02:47:29.770]
Okay.

[02:47:29.810 --> 02:47:35.190]
So anyway before you take another great call we have a special guest in the studio of course it's our regular Friday segment.

[02:47:35.230 --> 02:47:36.470]
Well I almost forgot about that so.

[02:47:37.090 --> 02:47:40.010]
Okay well we can find out before we get into the...

[02:47:40.010 --> 02:47:40.110]
What?

[02:47:40.490 --> 02:47:41.710]
We can fight out.

[02:47:42.590 --> 02:47:43.790]
Maybe you can fight out.

[02:47:44.630 --> 02:47:49.870]
Before we get to the wait thing about how he's doing how many applicants do we have?

[02:47:49.990 --> 02:47:50.710]
I mean we have...

[02:47:50.710 --> 02:47:52.330]
I think we actually are starting to get some in now.

[02:47:53.150 --> 02:47:54.310]
Well give me like a number.

[02:47:54.410 --> 02:47:55.550]
I don't know I'm not in charge of that.

[02:47:55.670 --> 02:47:55.830]
Yeah.

[02:47:56.030 --> 02:47:56.790]
That's a clearance thing.

[02:47:59.030 --> 02:48:00.210]
We're starting to get some in.

[02:48:00.570 --> 02:48:00.570]

[02:48:01.050 --> 02:48:01.330]
Good.

[02:48:02.270 --> 02:48:03.770]
So in other words you're not choosing it.

[02:48:03.870 --> 02:48:04.490]
This is just...

[02:48:04.490 --> 02:48:07.790]
This is just a companion to go somewhere like you know exactly.

[02:48:08.030 --> 02:48:09.150]
Like like I'm guiding light.

[02:48:09.470 --> 02:48:10.550]
What's his name is a companion?

[02:48:10.690 --> 02:48:12.390]
Now Ben is a companion.

[02:48:12.390 --> 02:48:13.090]
He's an escort.

[02:48:13.510 --> 02:48:14.210]
You know they win...

[02:48:14.210 --> 02:48:17.970]
They get separate rooms when they go to the Crystal Palace you realize.

[02:48:17.990 --> 02:48:19.610]
Very well I think we should...

[02:48:19.610 --> 02:48:21.190]
I think you should emphasize that.

[02:48:21.350 --> 02:48:23.770]
In fact I think they're going to be in separate wings of the casino.

[02:48:24.330 --> 02:48:24.990]
No pressure.

[02:48:25.110 --> 02:48:26.490]
Separate elevator separate wings.

[02:48:26.970 --> 02:48:28.990]
The only wings that the beast will be to have he eaten those.

[02:48:29.250 --> 02:48:30.630]
Now how are you doing on balance for life?

[02:48:30.810 --> 02:48:31.790]
I lost a pound this week.

[02:48:35.630 --> 02:48:36.370]
I don't know.

[02:48:38.270 --> 02:48:41.710]
So now well at least the one good thing I'll say that would make you 228?

[02:48:41.710 --> 02:48:42.070]
Yes.

[02:48:42.470 --> 02:48:44.430]
So that equals the all time low.

[02:48:45.390 --> 02:48:46.090]
That's not bad.

[02:48:46.210 --> 02:48:47.870]
It's 56 pounds off since you started.

[02:48:48.110 --> 02:48:48.250]
Right.

[02:48:48.810 --> 02:48:50.970]
And I mean we'll be perfectly honest with the audience.

[02:48:51.090 --> 02:48:53.570]
He hasn't exactly been on a straight-nero path the whole time.

[02:48:53.690 --> 02:48:53.790]
No.

[02:48:53.890 --> 02:48:57.170]
When on a couple of cruises with his well-to-do parents who keep knocking out.

[02:48:57.390 --> 02:48:58.950]
See if your parents really cared about you.

[02:48:59.030 --> 02:49:01.170]
I would say if they loved you without be carrying it too far.

[02:49:01.450 --> 02:49:04.030]
If they cared about you even a little bit they wouldn't be doing that.

[02:49:04.070 --> 02:49:06.130]
They wouldn't be putting that temptation in front of your eyes.

[02:49:06.250 --> 02:49:08.310]
So they're actually planning another cruise and a trip to Vegas.

[02:49:08.710 --> 02:49:10.170]
To a very after-cospital I hope.

[02:49:10.430 --> 02:49:11.390]
Yeah that's what we hope.

[02:49:11.390 --> 02:49:11.810]
No, no.

[02:49:11.970 --> 02:49:13.210]
See you're not paying any attention to me.

[02:49:13.390 --> 02:49:14.130]
Like it's a joke.

[02:49:14.690 --> 02:49:17.130]
You're talking to a guy that just had his second stroke.

[02:49:18.230 --> 02:49:19.410]
And you know what it came from?

[02:49:22.030 --> 02:49:24.090]
Besides Mo Howard, David and QAM and Greg Reed.

[02:49:24.090 --> 02:49:25.390]
The other thing was fat.

[02:49:27.170 --> 02:49:28.270]
Fat and active now.

[02:49:28.330 --> 02:49:30.150]
Are you at least working an out a little bit?

[02:49:30.230 --> 02:49:30.710]
I am working out.

[02:49:30.910 --> 02:49:32.010]
I have a trainer and working out.

[02:49:32.390 --> 02:49:33.090]
You have a trainer?

[02:49:33.290 --> 02:49:33.410]
Yeah.

[02:49:33.770 --> 02:49:36.850]
I think what he really means is he ate at Monty Trainers is what he's trying to say.

[02:49:38.050 --> 02:49:39.010]
He has a trainer.

[02:49:39.730 --> 02:49:43.650]
Just like that chimp on the new maid for Mrs. Wallace on passions.

[02:49:43.770 --> 02:49:44.630]
It's got a trainer.

[02:49:45.710 --> 02:49:47.210]
Probably the same on its training with a chimp.

[02:49:47.390 --> 02:49:48.850]
Well nice going beast, not too bad.

[02:49:50.190 --> 02:49:52.910]
And Mo we understand his very upset over this promotion you're doing.

[02:49:52.990 --> 02:49:54.890]
That's the word I'm here, which is another reason we like it a lot.

[02:49:54.970 --> 02:49:57.090]
It's okay, he brings me up every morning so it's good publicity.

[02:49:57.610 --> 02:49:58.070]
Does he really?

[02:49:58.310 --> 02:49:58.310]

[02:49:58.670 --> 02:49:59.390]
What about what?

[02:49:59.650 --> 02:50:01.610]
I don't know, he'd like to throw me in there and his little stack.

[02:50:02.250 --> 02:50:03.290]
Like the three under the bus?

[02:50:03.450 --> 02:50:04.070]
He's all inclusive.

[02:50:04.210 --> 02:50:05.170]
Carlos is in there now.

[02:50:05.310 --> 02:50:07.470]
Yeah that's it's getting so crowded out of that bus man.

[02:50:07.470 --> 02:50:08.630]
We're going to have to get a fleet of buses.

[02:50:08.630 --> 02:50:12.970]
They're going to have to get some Mack trucks at the QA and parking lot because Mo keeps throwing everybody under there.

[02:50:13.710 --> 02:50:16.110]
He tried to throw Doreen under there but she wouldn't fit.

[02:50:17.750 --> 02:50:19.170]
Poor Doreen the queen man.

[02:50:19.450 --> 02:50:22.350]
I'll tell you I give her big, big marks man for big balls.

[02:50:22.650 --> 02:50:23.510]
More than you got beast.

[02:50:24.530 --> 02:50:25.170]
I have to agree.

[02:50:25.310 --> 02:50:25.910]
That's not saying much.

[02:50:26.370 --> 02:50:28.110]
No but seriously she had big balls.

[02:50:28.230 --> 02:50:29.290]
She told him right to his face.

[02:50:29.290 --> 02:50:32.830]
She said you mother scratch and piece of old whatever she said.

[02:50:33.450 --> 02:50:36.150]
She not taking any crap from that comergy and the old piece of dirt.

[02:50:36.150 --> 02:50:38.530]
And then she kicked his bag right in his buses what I heard.

[02:50:38.850 --> 02:50:40.970]
She kicked his costume back right in his buses.

[02:50:40.990 --> 02:50:41.890]
You're a bastard.

[02:50:42.270 --> 02:50:42.630]
Exactly.

[02:50:43.310 --> 02:50:45.350]
Nice going Doreen we take everything back.

[02:50:46.030 --> 02:50:47.350]
I'm going to lock all this.

[02:50:47.810 --> 02:50:48.690]
This is five sixty.

[02:50:49.310 --> 02:50:50.590]
The rain is all yours now.

[02:50:51.450 --> 02:50:52.370]
See you in.

[02:50:54.350 --> 02:50:56.930]
Don't you go back to Canada you cute bastard.

[02:50:56.930 --> 02:51:03.050]
But there is a fairy and he's gone again Mary.

[02:51:03.650 --> 02:51:09.430]
Mary is a fairy and he's gone again Mary.

[02:51:10.890 --> 02:51:13.910]
Still living homo stories.

[02:51:14.710 --> 02:51:17.010]
Yard again Mary.

[02:51:17.770 --> 02:51:21.990]
Oh no, that's the girl in a hole.

[02:51:24.810 --> 02:51:34.290]
He's a queer or a wolf means and who then I'm nothing queer.

[02:51:35.410 --> 02:51:40.970]
Letting his shoes fall and crowned few.

[02:51:42.910 --> 02:51:49.930]
Now hating you who wears panties underneath his shoes.

[02:51:49.930 --> 02:51:51.410]
I'm actually the lesbian.

[02:51:51.410 --> 02:51:59.470]
Mary is a me if I'm very so he's got to get Mary.

[02:52:00.110 --> 02:52:06.810]
Mary is a fairy and he's gone again Mary.

[02:52:07.290 --> 02:52:13.490]
Still hating homo now he's got to get Mary.

[02:52:14.250 --> 02:52:18.070]
So scared of the white house homo.

[02:52:18.070 --> 02:52:21.690]
Final diplomatic moments.

[02:53:06.990 --> 02:53:09.630]
I'm going to lock all this.

[02:53:09.630 --> 02:53:09.630]

[02:53:10.130 --> 02:53:10.130]

[02:53:10.410 --> 02:53:15.270]
I'm going to lock all this.

[02:53:23.770 --> 02:53:24.850]
Just a bit of resolution.

[02:53:25.410 --> 02:53:31.370]
I'm not aware the truth and eventuality are a circumstance that anybody else has suggested let alone the leaders of those nations.

[02:53:31.470 --> 02:53:37.070]
So what he said, he said that we're in the final stages of diplomatic whatever you know what that means?

[02:53:37.370 --> 02:53:38.030]
We're on Tuesday.

[02:53:38.310 --> 02:53:39.270]
Get ready.

[02:53:39.770 --> 02:53:40.670]
Strap yourselves in.

[02:54:36.590 --> 02:54:38.310]
Your song is what happened with him?

[02:54:38.370 --> 02:54:39.070]
Did he take up an arm?

[02:54:40.130 --> 02:54:42.610]
Yeah, he said on the ground in the Middle East. That's what he said

[02:54:43.910 --> 02:54:45.870]

WQ I am

[02:54:56.590 --> 02:54:57.710]
Hey Neil how are you?

[02:54:57.810 --> 02:54:58.230]
I'm great.

[02:54:58.870 --> 02:55:04.430]
I'm not doing so well. I've been listening to some of these callers lately. I took a little break because of my job

[02:55:04.430 --> 02:55:08.690]
And I couldn't listen to your show unfortunately and just recently been sort of listening back to it.

[02:55:08.690 --> 02:55:09.050]
Yeah.

[02:55:09.450 --> 02:55:11.870]
Oh my gosh what happened to this place?

[02:55:12.110 --> 02:55:12.890]
What do you mean by that?

[02:55:13.590 --> 02:55:20.890]
Well here like for example since you're doing a non-the-no screen routine here, you know every time you hear that little somebody calling you home or something they hang up

[02:55:20.890 --> 02:55:25.990]
They run back to their radio so they can control over your neck and their squeezing themselves right?

[02:55:26.290 --> 02:55:28.050]
Unbelievable. Nothing ever changes.

[02:55:28.250 --> 02:55:29.990]
The video is getting worse down in this cell.

[02:55:29.990 --> 02:55:33.790]
You're right that's why I'm here. That's why I'm in Toronto with a big smile on my face looking out the sunshine.

[02:55:33.930 --> 02:55:35.110]
It's going to be a beautiful weekend.

[02:55:36.510 --> 02:55:39.770]
Unbelievable. I'm back in my bag and I'm getting out of dodge.

[02:55:40.330 --> 02:55:41.250]
I'll see you at the border Ray.

[02:55:41.730 --> 02:55:43.610]
Hey. Have a good weekend Neil.

[02:55:43.670 --> 02:55:44.370]
I'm great thanks.

[02:55:44.690 --> 02:55:44.850]
Thanks.

[02:55:45.350 --> 02:55:46.770]
See there you go he's catching on.

[02:55:47.250 --> 02:55:49.550]
This show is I've put you that for years and it's the truth.

[02:55:50.310 --> 02:55:56.050]
This show and the people who call it are a direct reflection of what's off load is all about at least on the your call and end.

[02:55:57.370 --> 02:55:59.150]
There can be no question about that.

[02:55:59.330 --> 02:56:04.850]
You can it's kind of like taking a rectal or thermometer and sticking it into the anus of that state of that penisula.

[02:56:05.910 --> 02:56:06.870]
Oh there's Wolflet's Creek.

[02:56:06.990 --> 02:56:09.110]
And throughout the weekend for all it's just a promo.

[02:56:09.290 --> 02:56:11.550]
I thought it was like something really important for him to be on it this time.

[02:56:11.550 --> 02:56:16.070]
And they Wolflet's Creek when you assume that something really like major major performance going on.

[02:56:16.130 --> 02:56:18.070]
When you know he's a pin in the ass.

[02:56:18.170 --> 02:56:18.930]
He's not a shill.

[02:56:20.630 --> 02:56:23.510]
Another shy and we got Peter Arnet over there speaking of communist.

[02:56:24.190 --> 02:56:29.310]
Can you believe that the doctor or Laura said that those people are protesting against the word 90% of our comments.

[02:56:29.470 --> 02:56:30.550]
I'm shocked and surprised.

[02:56:30.890 --> 02:56:35.510]
I mean somebody ought to tell Dr. Laura that that common is the crap went out with most checkered pants.

[02:57:05.510 --> 02:57:07.010]
I'm scared to be scared.

[02:57:08.130 --> 02:57:10.210]
Don't talk about the old line.

[02:57:10.730 --> 02:57:12.430]
This drug and rich kid.

[02:57:13.790 --> 02:57:15.730]
Don't talk about these even.

[02:57:16.390 --> 02:57:17.630]
Some are their meat.

[02:57:18.430 --> 02:57:19.950]
I'm his president.

[02:57:20.270 --> 02:57:20.790]
