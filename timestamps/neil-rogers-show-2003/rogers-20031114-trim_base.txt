George Bush is a liar

[00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.920]

Rumsfeld says, all is well and other soldier does

[00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.020]
A jubilut?

[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.820]
Outspoken Democrat, in the mail they get in

And the sinister media, as you believe in

[00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.860]
George Bush is a liar

[00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.660]
This song is something that'll never get on their channel

[00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.080]
George Bush is a liar

[00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.060]
A traitor and dignity in a criminal PC

[00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.560]

Oh, there's a lot to come back, could be said about that but a better not be

So here we go, Lloyd Pettit died

[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:51.340]
He died?

[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.900]
He died November 11th in Milwaukee, the age of 76

[00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.880]
He was uh, big with a Milwaukee boxy

[00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.420]
And his wife donated money to build the Milwaukee's Bradley Center

[00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.980]

And also Tony Thompson died

[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.000]
Well, somebody is faxing me about dead people

[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.400]
He died?

[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.100]
Not Tommy Thompson, the cheesehead

[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:17.400]
Tony Thompson

[00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.760]
noted session drummer was a member of two super groups in the 70s and 80s

[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.020]
See, I shouldn't have eaten that omelette

[00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:24.860]
I mean, thanks a lot Troy for balance for life

[00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:26.360]
It was really delicious as shrimp omelette

[00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.000]
I didn't need it, I didn't want it

[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.320]
And now, and I, you know, now my throat's all like full of crap

[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.780]
You know what I mean?

[00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:32.660]
Flamie

[00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.960]
Ah!

[00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.740]
Ah!

[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.040]

[00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:35.260]
Like that

[00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.160]
I didn't want that

[00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.300]
As holes, why does Troy Stratford do that to me?

[00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.060]
Troy, you're not a bad guy and thanks for the shirts from my buddy Shelley Bloom

[00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:44.760]
But Jesus Christ, man

[00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:46.560]
Haven't I been screaming?

[00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:47.540]
I don't want food in here

[00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:48.880]
I had like two strips of bacon yesterday

[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.540]
It's the only food I've eaten in here all week long

[00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.120]
And here comes my buddy Troy

[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.140]
With two big sacks of stuff, you know

[00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.840]
Good stuff

[00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:55.860]
But I don't want it

[00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:56.720]
I don't need it

[00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:57.800]
I don't want it

[00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.620]
Good stuff, there's a nice cookie in there too

[00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:02.200]
Should I eat that?

[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:03.200]
No, I'm gonna go get it

[00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:04.020]
I'm gonna get it now

[00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.400]
Ah!

[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.460]
Ah!

[00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:07.560]
You're gonna die

[00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.100]
You'll send my blood sugar way up

[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:14.200]
I see that

[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.640]
I think it's like an oatmeal cookie

[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.080]
Help me, one raisin, they were great

[00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.960]
They're really delicious

[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:19.200]
And they send my, they're full of sugar

[00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.080]
And they'll send my bloccee

[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:22.060]
If you're on a balance for life

[00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.880]
You wouldn't select this

[00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:23.880]
If you're diabetic like me

[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.600]
Because you know, it's gonna send your blood sugar way up

[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:26.740]
Made with honey

[00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.600]
Mmm

[00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.660]
Mmm

[00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:29.260]
Do it

[00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:31.580]
Man, oh man

[00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:32.460]
It'll be sick by noon

[00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:33.940]
Good, then I can go home early

[00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:34.600]
Sounds good to me

[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.600]
Grab my junior honey

[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:37.540]
Yeah, I'm okay

[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:40.820]
Anyway, what the hell was I doing here?

[00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:42.020]
I'm trying to do a goddamn radio show

[00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:43.020]
We're talking about dead people

[00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.780]
Tony Thompson

[00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.300]
noted session drummer is a member of two super groups in the 70s

[00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.020]
The disco funk group Sheik

[00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:50.460]
So I'd beg hits with Leia Freak

[00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:51.820]
Good times in dance dance dance

[00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.280]
I thought that was the Beach Boys dance dance dance

[00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:55.180]
Different song

[00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:59.220]
And later Superstar Rock Group power station

[00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:00.820]
Which included the late Robert Palmer

[00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.060]
I had top ten hits with some like it out and get it on

[00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:05.700]
I had November 12th in Los Angeles

[00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.960]
A renal self-cancer at age 47

[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:10.660]
renal self-cancer

[00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:11.180]
He died?

[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:12.000]
47

[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.000]
So thanks a lot for the dead people

[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.040]
Whoever faxed that to me

[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.700]
Die like flies, I'm telling you

[00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:18.880]
Here's the result of yesterday's pull

[00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.140]
And I'm driving home for my mother's at lunch yesterday

[00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:23.560]
By the way, mom's doing just fine

[00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:24.880]
Doing better than most of us

[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:25.800]
Damn it

[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:26.920]
Anyway, she's doing okay

[00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:28.860]
Well good

[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:31.360]
I knew he'd be very concerned

[00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:34.880]
And I'm driving home. It's about a quarter to two

[00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:37.000]
And I'm listening to the mad dog

[00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:39.440]
And here's a series of callers

[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:40.500]
And of course, you know

[00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.360]
I mean everybody's entitled their opinion

[00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:43.800]
No it was a quarter to four

[00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:44.460]
I take that back

[00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:45.320]
Because it was almost the end of it

[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:45.780]
How could it be?

[00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:46.360]
It was going to wonder how

[00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:47.460]
I left you early

[00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:47.880]
Far be forever

[00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:50.400]
It's my blood sugar is already going up from the cookie

[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.280]
I can see it

[00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:54.160]
And the calls of course

[00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:54.700]
Well you know

[00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.900]
I spent the whole day with Ferrell today

[00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:58.160]
Jim and he wants to thank you

[00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:59.600]
You're the only one on that station

[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:00.660]
Who told it like it was

[00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.900]
And you were the one who was nice to him

[00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:03.480]
And really a friend

[00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:04.060]
Baba ba ba ba ba

[00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:04.680]
And I had the idea

[00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:05.900]
Well I want to say right now

[00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.060]
As much as I love the mad dog

[00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:07.600]
And I really do

[00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:09.320]
We don't always agree on everything

[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:09.960]
And that's fine

[00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:12.280]
But a lot of you callers out there

[00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:13.480]
It's easy to open up a big mouth

[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:14.980]
When you're on the outside of a situation

[00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:16.160]
Looking in and you have no idea

[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:17.540]
What's really going on in here

[00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.300]
Everybody out there is an expert

[00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:20.880]
And by we really like them

[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.020]
You know something I like them

[00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:23.240]
I thought he was a hoot

[00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:23.980]
And now we say that

[00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:24.940]
I thought it was a hoot

[00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:26.160]
But the fact of the matter is

[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:27.320]
He dug his own grave

[00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:29.620]
And now he only dig his own grave

[00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:30.940]
But every time somebody tried it

[00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:32.200]
Like extend a hand to pull him out

[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:33.760]
He'd like heap more dirt on it

[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:34.280]
And like dig it

[00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.340]
Like he had a shovel inside the ground

[00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:37.980]
It was digging deeper to try to go to China

[00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:40.140]
Now anybody out there

[00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:41.300]
Whether they spent the day with him

[00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:42.340]
Or whether they're best of friends

[00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:42.900]
Or whatever else

[00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:44.040]
You can bullcrap all you want

[00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:45.480]
Because nobody supported him

[00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:46.460]
Or in the station that I did

[00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:48.680]
Including a supposed good buddy Mo

[00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:50.900]
He was dancing on his grave yesterday morning

[00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:51.800]
You're an asshole Mo

[00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:53.400]
And I managed to get to the whole week

[00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:54.400]
And never saw Mo once

[00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:55.900]
I was going to write that in my diary

[00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:57.300]
I got through a whole week at QM

[00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.020]
And never saw that miserable bastard one

[00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:00.440]
And the beast figured it out

[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:01.960]
The dog ran off with his hairpiece

[00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:03.560]
That's why he's been wearing them silly hats all week

[00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:04.520]
So you haven't seen him

[00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:05.680]
You haven't seen the ganks the cat

[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:06.980]
I haven't been anywhere near him

[00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:07.780]
I didn't see him

[00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:08.620]
I didn't smell him

[00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:10.280]
And he should only rot and heal the moment

[00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:11.740]
He's smelling like a felon

[00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:13.140]
And he's supposedly a

[00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:13.880]
For else good friend

[00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:14.140]
You know

[00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:15.680]
Well, I'm the weed known inside of for years

[00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:16.360]
And then

[00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:17.560]
Then yesterday morning

[00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:18.700]
He's dancing on his grave

[00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:20.280]
Which I will dance on your grave Mo

[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:21.760]
But just like I'm on the cover of our CD

[00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:22.420]
No, I will

[00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:23.280]
I'll fart in his face

[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:24.560]
And I'll dance on his grave

[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:25.860]
And we'll give me great pleasure

[00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:27.820]
Because he's a hateful, miserable prick

[00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:30.200]
And if a girl thinks that's his brain

[00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:31.080]
Well, good luck to him

[00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:34.180]
You know, and a mad dog's got his construction business

[00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:35.820]
And sure, I'm out of town most of the time

[00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:38.540]
But you don't have to be here to really get the flavor of what's going on

[00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:40.980]
Plus, I heard some other incredible stories here this morning

[00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:42.340]
That I wasn't even aware of

[00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:45.040]
But one thing I neglected yesterday

[00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:46.420]
Which after the break I want to get to it

[00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:48.460]
Because it's very important for the audience to understand

[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:49.640]
Who think that

[00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:51.100]
Wow, you know, it's just a few ugly words

[00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:52.520]
Neal says worse stuff than that

[00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:53.200]
And he got blown out

[00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:55.120]
Important for the audience to understand

[00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:56.680]
Really some of the stuff that went on

[00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:58.500]
He wasn't going to be fired on Wednesday

[00:07:58.500 --> 00:07:59.460]
He was going to be suspended

[00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:02.380]
And then it is a termination to be made

[00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:03.480]
TBA to be announced

[00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:05.160]
After like a face to face it down

[00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:06.580]
After a 24 hour cooling off period

[00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:08.480]
Can we salvage this one more time

[00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:10.020]
For the 500th time, you know

[00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:11.900]
And then sit

[00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:13.100]
Well, I'll get to that

[00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:13.600]
Save it

[00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:15.220]
Tease it

[00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:16.320]
Win and down

[00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:16.840]
Get in there

[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:17.320]
Yeah

[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:20.260]
Man, what a week

[00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:21.460]
I should know how to pick him, don't I

[00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:22.920]
You're a magical

[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:24.600]
But I'll be gone soon

[00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:26.720]
1009 at 560 WQ

[00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:28.260]
And hey, speaking of low carbs

[00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:30.600]
Hmm, well I'll cook you

[00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:30.920]
Well

[00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:32.460]
You're good

[00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:33.960]
Well, why did he do that to me

[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:34.760]
Evil

[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:36.860]
Troy Schreffer, I hate you like poison

[00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:37.360]
Of course

[00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:37.900]
And asshole

[00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:40.440]
Why did he doesn't need to bring me in

[00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:42.020]
Oh, I know what all the food is

[00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:44.220]
I had enough of his food to sink a battleship

[00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:45.020]
It's really fast through

[00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:45.840]
No, I like it

[00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:47.020]
That is good

[00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:47.440]
They are good

[00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:47.660]
Really

[00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:49.780]
God, and unfortunately

[00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:50.840]
See, there's the difference

[00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:52.180]
It's good that we're doing this spot now

[00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:52.440]
Right

[00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:53.120]
Made with pressure

[00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:55.040]
This cookie is made with like honey and sugar

[00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:56.240]
And it's loaded with card sugar

[00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:58.780]
The ones you'll find at the lights don't have that

[00:08:58.780 --> 00:08:59.520]
You know

[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:00.880]
They've got the other stuff

[00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:01.700]
And they're sure you're substitute

[00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:03.020]
And they're still taste delicious

[00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:05.220]
But your blood sugar doesn't go skyrocketing

[00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:05.520]

[00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:33.220]
And I turn on that sweaters

10-15 at 5-60 W-Cerm

[00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:40.800]
So here's the poll we took yesterday

[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:41.640]
The second poll

[00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:43.000]
But do we have a response in this?

[00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:43.660]
Here what?

[00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:44.080]
Huh?

[00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:45.980]
But I do want to say it again

[00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:47.240]
I'm hearing these calls on Mandage

[00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:47.800]
You show yesterday

[00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:49.580]
Driving home from mommy's about a quarter to four

[00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:50.920]
I thought I was going to lose my mind

[00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:54.180]
You know everybody's entitled their opinion

[00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:55.500]
But the fact of the matter is

[00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:57.500]
All these instant armchair quarterbacks out there

[00:12:57.500 --> 00:12:58.580]
Who we didn't know what's going on

[00:12:58.580 --> 00:12:59.920]
You don't know squat, okay

[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:02.760]
All 99% of you have any idea what you're talking about

[00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:04.660]
Is what you hear from other people on the year

[00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:06.780]
And then I find out some of the stories

[00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:07.820]
Which I'm not going to repeat them

[00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:09.060]
Because I was asked not to repeat them

[00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:10.300]
The stuff going on in here

[00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:11.320]
I mean it

[00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:13.620]
It's a miracle like I said yesterday

[00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:14.840]
That lasted that long

[00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:15.960]
It's a miracle

[00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:18.200]
So anybody who thinks that

[00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:20.680]
Forbunnel got the short end of the stick in this place

[00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:21.320]
Is dreaming

[00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:22.080]
And again

[00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:23.100]
I like the guy

[00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:24.600]
But he's a hard

[00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:26.880]
What's the word I'm looking for?

[00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:27.600]
Not to crack

[00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:28.380]
A hard and very

[00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:32.020]
He's a hard coconut to crack man

[00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:32.640]
I'll take that

[00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:35.740]
I mean it's hard to penetrate that skull

[00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:37.180]
And get the message through in there

[00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:37.440]
Okay

[00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:39.320]
Just ease back for a little while

[00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:40.000]
For a few months

[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:40.600]
Cut the crap

[00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:42.180]
And take the mind of the bank

[00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:43.240]
Which is what I kept telling him

[00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:43.980]
Over and over again

[00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:44.640]
Would he do it?

[00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:44.960]
No

[00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:45.780]
Would he listen to me?

[00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:46.000]
No

[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:46.780]
Well listen to anybody

[00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:48.520]
Because you don't shut up long enough to listen

[00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:48.820]
Ah

[00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:49.160]
Ah

[00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:49.500]
Ah

[00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:49.720]
Ah

[00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:52.500]
And this business

[00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:53.760]
I get faxes from people saying

[00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:55.320]
Well you know that act with that voice

[00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:56.240]
There's no act

[00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:57.260]
And there's no phony voice

[00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:57.720]
That's it

[00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:58.480]
That's exactly

[00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:00.000]
What you see is what you get

[00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:02.080]
Little more profanity off the air

[00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:03.360]
A little more

[00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:03.840]
Not too much

[00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:05.260]
14

[00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:06.000]
Is that possible?

[00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:08.000]
1460 votes on a pool from yesterday

[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.580]
Who would you like to see replaced for all

[00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:10.640]
For me to 10 on QAM

[00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:12.120]
And wouldn't you know there's the little dog

[00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:12.960]
And they're already this morning

[00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:13.700]
With nice seeing Joe

[00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:14.360]
Joe's a good guy

[00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:14.980]
Yes he is

[00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:16.620]
Nobody don't like Joe Rose

[00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:17.720]
And like I said every now and then

[00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:18.600]
A little bit of a backstab

[00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:20.100]
Ha ha ha ha

[00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:20.980]
I've always said

[00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:22.360]
I don't know why he said that about him

[00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:23.200]
I guess because it's true

[00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:24.420]
Who do you step?

[00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:25.420]
I don't know

[00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:26.200]
We'll figure it out

[00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:27.920]
I've forgotten it so long now

[00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:30.220]
But it was kind of interesting

[00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:31.760]
Because I heard him talking about

[00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:31.980]
Wow

[00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:33.120]
You know it's like old times again

[00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:33.800]
Here's the beast

[00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:35.180]
And Joltey and Gryper in here

[00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:36.320]
Gryper should have been fired

[00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:37.000]
By the way again

[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:37.420]
Clarence

[00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:38.660]
Now here's the deal

[00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:39.940]
Augurantia

[00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:41.060]
The Clarence is doing Gryper

[00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:41.760]
The other way around

[00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:42.360]
They're doing it

[00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:43.060]
No seriously

[00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:46.360]
Because the thing that broke the camels back on Wednesday morning

[00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:47.820]
I said this yesterday I'll say it again

[00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:50.500]
One of the things that dismayed

[00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:51.880]
The middle-level management people here

[00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:53.540]
Was the fact that what Ferrell said

[00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:55.260]
Wasn't dumped and it went on the air

[00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:57.220]
Now you know as well as I do

[00:14:58.100 --> 00:14:59.780]
That they've been watching

[00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:01.860]
Like they've been dumping crap left and right in there

[00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:02.920]
So if the audience thinks you know

[00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:03.820]
Stuff that's on the air

[00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:04.840]
Well I wasn't all that bad

[00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:06.100]
That's the stuff that got on the air

[00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:07.220]
Okay right

[00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:08.700]
They've been hit that dump button

[00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:09.280]
Like it was a guy

[00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:10.680]
Them pesa container

[00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:11.900]
They were gonna get another delay

[00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:13.500]
So that they could do double dump

[00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:14.700]
Double dump

[00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:15.960]
I've had those days

[00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:17.380]
In fact a couple of days ago

[00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:18.420]
How about the 20

[00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:19.440]
How about an hour from now

[00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:19.700]
No

[00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:21.040]
Oh yeah that's the egg ramblet

[00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:21.560]
And the cookie

[00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:22.820]
Thanks a lot Troy

[00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:23.340]
You idiot

[00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:24.580]
Jesus Christ

[00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:26.360]
See this was the last day

[00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:27.520]
Plus it's because you came back

[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:27.960]
I said yeah

[00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:28.720]
I don't want to do it

[00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:29.520]
No you're the one

[00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:31.540]
You probably told the Troi's tractor to do it

[00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:32.640]
And it brings that other Troy in here

[00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:34.560]
Oh here's two sackfuls of food, Neil

[00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:35.080]
Last year

[00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:35.600]
But I'm leaving tomorrow

[00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:36.900]
Mo and all here's a whole bunch of food

[00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:37.640]
Last test to kill him

[00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:37.860]
Yeah

[00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:38.840]
Ashtoles

[00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:40.860]
Who would you like to see

[00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:42.760]
Replace for while 8 to 10am on QAM

[00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:44.840]
1460 votes

[00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:46.100]
Plus we had 560

[00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:47.700]
We did over 2,000 votes

[00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:49.700]
On the two polls about the

[00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:50.320]
For all situation

[00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:51.460]
We got another one for today

[00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:52.120]
And over the weekend

[00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:53.760]
Which a little more specific

[00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:54.840]
About the situation

[00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:57.500]
Well now let's let's let them be experts

[00:15:57.500 --> 00:15:59.100]
Since they all know what's going on

[00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:00.680]
1460

[00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:02.440]
Rick and suds 457

[00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:04.700]
Nobody even came close

[00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:05.740]
To Rick and sud

[00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:07.260]
Of course like I keep telling you

[00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:08.020]
And it could have happened

[00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:08.400]
Damn it

[00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:09.400]
No they're not going to be on

[00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:10.400]
Because it requires some money

[00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:11.480]
Plus guess what

[00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:12.380]
You know what they don't do

[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:13.780]
Spor right

[00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:14.340]
That's it

[00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:15.960]
They don't do a sports show

[00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:16.860]
Rick and suds

[00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:18.440]
So how do we have them here

[00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:19.700]
On a radio station that's obsessed

[00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:21.120]
That's sick with his crap

[00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:22.420]
That we're always talking about

[00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:22.860]
Sports

[00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:23.420]
Right

[00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:26.040]
Rick and suds 457

[00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:27.320]
I mean just a gigantic number

[00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:28.500]
Don't care

[00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:29.320]
I won't listen anyway

[00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:30.060]
303

[00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:31.460]
That's 20.7%

[00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:32.080]
Those are the people

[00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:33.500]
Who got some other morning show they like

[00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:34.880]
They're busy doing something

[00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:35.380]
Else in the morning

[00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:36.100]
Whatever it is

[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.720]
Jeff DeForest a shocker

[00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:39.260]
199

[00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:42.180]
And you remember last time we did a pull

[00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:42.900]
Similar

[00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:44.140]
Uh he did very well

[00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:45.740]
Yes so and I thought it was like a set up deal

[00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:46.560]
But it wasn't

[00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:47.360]
They like him for like

[00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:47.860]
They like the foe

[00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:49.180]
Now why do you

[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.640]
Why do you say it that way like

[00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:53.120]
You can't figure out why

[00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:54.440]
That's that that's what I'm reading

[00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:56.780]
No I think you're right

[00:16:56.780 --> 00:16:58.180]
No I like the foe

[00:16:58.180 --> 00:16:58.900]
I like more of that

[00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:00.600]
I don't think compared to say to like the

[00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:02.420]
Little and big dogs to the dog guys

[00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:03.720]
That he's like even the same categor

[00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:05.340]
I mean with all the respect the foe

[00:17:05.340 --> 00:17:06.280]
Wish you nothing but the best

[00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:07.420]
If they brought you in here on Monday

[00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:08.260]
I said hey all right

[00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:09.340]
There's the foe

[00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:09.760]
Dance straight

[00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:11.100]
How let's go to the Indians

[00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:11.920]
You know something like that

[00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:13.320]
Goldie could bond like old times

[00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:14.200]
No yeah

[00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:15.600]
Goldie

[00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:17.340]
Hey listen I saw Goldie in the whole

[00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:18.800]
This morning I was going in her take a leak

[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:20.020]
In fact he went right in there with me

[00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:20.980]
Which is kind of surprising

[00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:22.260]
You're not my type Yolte

[00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:22.720]
Stay away

[00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:24.260]
He does stand far from the urinal though

[00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:25.060]
Yeah he did

[00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:26.720]
We were like against the wall

[00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:28.820]
And uh he was giving me a bit

[00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:29.780]
I can't repeat on a year

[00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:31.200]
Because I promised I was going to repeat

[00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:32.280]
Everybody I talked to in here

[00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:33.180]
Oh don't say they're okay

[00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:34.780]
Nobody did say something

[00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:37.100]
And uh I can't remember what that was

[00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:38.120]
Water sure is cold

[00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:38.960]
Yeah he said

[00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:39.540]
Haha

[00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:41.280]
No I was I had a line there

[00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:42.200]
And then you distracted me

[00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:43.760]
Something they told me that I can actually repeat

[00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:45.200]
Now I forgot to because all the other stuff

[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:45.800]
I can't repeat

[00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:47.480]
Well forget about him

[00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:48.920]
Jeff DeForest 199

[00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:50.620]
Just forget I said Keldie okay

[00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:53.120]
Joe Rose 158

[00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:55.220]
Jim Manage the man dog 112

[00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:55.860]
All right

[00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:57.340]
Which I would have thought he'd do it on better net

[00:17:57.340 --> 00:17:59.380]
But I guess a lot of people like him right where he is there

[00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:00.260]
And uh two to four

[00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:01.160]
That's a good spot

[00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:04.080]
The big oh oh 58

[00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:07.240]
Uh that that omelette's already working his way back to you you know

[00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:08.700]
Uh that was that

[00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:10.000]
No that was unacceptable

[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.020]
I'm sick and tired of coming in here

[00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:13.100]
And having it in the middle of the show

[00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:15.940]
To run and take a big gigantic egg omelette crap

[00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:17.400]
I don't want that you know

[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:18.420]
Yeah

[00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:20.760]
That's going to be a lot worse than that believe me

[00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:23.940]
Moen Geldie together again

[00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:25.300]
60 to 10 a.m 29

[00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:27.500]
Only 29 out of 14

[00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:28.920]
I don't know almost 1500 votes

[00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:32.160]
29 1.9 percent want them to do the whole four hours together

[00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:35.900]
Kimba Bo camper who filled in admirably well weekly yesterday morning

[00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:37.200]
Good guy but boring

[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:37.960]
28

[00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:41.620]
And Joe is a gackie wait till you see this wow

[00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:43.480]
Here's a gackie sucks okay

[00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:44.120]
10

[00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:47.380]
Yeah 10

[00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:50.820]
0.6 percent 10

[00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:54.120]
Out of almost 1500 votes not too good Joe

[00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:57.220]
They think you're really coma inducing in your penis face but nevertheless

[00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:00.760]
And they're they're right on both counts but he's a great guy

[00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:06.900]
Right he's a great guy he is well not great. He's a good guy an excellent guy like I said he's okay

[00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:11.300]
He never stole a freight train plus he did some nice things for charity there and then you got it damn

[00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:15.340]
You got killed doing it during hurricane Andrew. Why do people laugh about that? See that's a one thing

[00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:17.800]
I'm not gonna start knocking for real because you know

[00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:21.500]
He's not hearing I can't he ain't coming back and he's gonna be somewhere else soon. I guess I don't know

[00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:23.220]
But but it did bother me

[00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:27.840]
Well there were several things that bothered me but the one that really bothered me was that bit like when dance night

[00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:29.860]
I got killed and I crashed and

[00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:35.380]
Would um Danny heatly with it and the guy did the Atlanta thrashers games for a season

[00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:40.600]
And was always hysterical. Yeah, it was always great that somebody died. See I don't you know

[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.740]
There's some people if they died. I don't want to mention any names

[00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:50.720]
But uh huh? Huh? No, I didn't say that I did some people if they croaked it would be very amusing absolutely

[00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:58.300]
But generally speaking I don't find that funny, but he always I'll be with that. I had a little problem that now

[00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:01.220]
This call that you've on here from Mark Claire, New Jersey. Who could that be hello?

[00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:02.620]
What yes, sir?

[00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:07.260]
Lloyd Pettit and Dan Keller were two of the greatest talking out. Are you on a speaker phone?

[00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:10.080]
I'm sorry. Why are you on a speaker phone? Is this better?

[00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:14.980]
Well if you get read a little within a couple of feet of the phone and just not scream so that would be great my bad

[00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:19.580]
Your bed Lloyd Pettit and Dan Kelly two of the greatest announcers of all time. They're both dead

[00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:24.920]
Dead and even worse than that Dan Kelly's kid is there in Colorado and abortion. Yeah, he's awful

[00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:26.860]
He's horrible. I got a question for you

[00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:31.460]
Anyway, go ahead by the way to leave I can't believe it's picking a hockey

[00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:35.020]
I went to bed the leaves are losing four to one after two periods

[00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:39.340]
I thought they're taking it up the old shoot again last then in LA right after they blew it man on and I wake up

[00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:43.880]
This morning to find him made a great comeback four four to time nice going bad nice going leaves

[00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:49.060]
The question was about that game. What is Jack Nicholson doing at a hockey game? What was this at

[00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:53.560]
When you're better for the elites and see there's my psychic powers again. How do you like that? What it is?

[00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:58.640]
Well, he had nothing else to do. Well, I tell you what Jack Nicholson wouldn't know a cross-check from a porno flick. Okay

[00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:03.980]
Okay, that's all the material I guess. Yeah, who the hell was that that was somebody in a business

[00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:07.380]
Well, not somebody with a great booming voice. Yeah, let's put him on 8 to 10

[00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:11.420]
Then the resume. Yeah, set us a resume. Okay. Now. I think I think we'll be okay

[00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:18.140]
Now, let's see here's somebody says why didn't you put the crow on the pool yesterday? It says he's worthy

[00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:22.960]
He's worthy. Well, let me just say this to you. Okay. I like that one

[00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:26.660]
Yeah, let's put him on a he's worthy. Let me rent. Merit

[00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:33.040]
Mani Ramirez see that's funny for about three seconds, but two hours of how about you and me

[00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:35.000]
Yeah, the trove me this ball

[00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:41.280]
I ain't got to cut a plus the fact that the people in a building would have never come to work because I can't stand at the smell of a talcum powder

[00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:45.860]
People think I'm making that stuff up. I have never he's a good guy. I like the crow

[00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:49.560]
He has no business being on the air, but then we have a lot of people in that category here

[00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:54.480]
Oh, say I got sidetracked from Robert creeper should have been fired. Oh, that's a sidetracked myself. See

[00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:58.020]
Because I went through that yesterday and they didn't dump it

[00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:04.340]
But Robert creeper will never be fired here because he and Clarence our program director are very very tight

[00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:07.420]
If you get my drift there's a Jewish sports fraternity here

[00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:11.600]
Sports fraternity in other words, it's a little circle jerk the beast is the pivot man

[00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:15.520]
He's in the middle and you got Clarence and the Robert creeper around the edges on the outside

[00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:22.260]
Yeah, that's it. It's the Jewish sports circles here at QAM. You know what I'm saying? Absolutely

[00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:27.460]
Why I already changed the thing in there so we can't he can't say come on mo you can do it absolutely. Thank you

[00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:33.060]
So here's today's pool here's a good fact from David and Miami see I don't really care today

[00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:35.800]
I'm just I'm just gonna ramble. I don't I don't care

[00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:39.060]
I got a bunch of bedtime stories like I always do I don't I don't care about any of it

[00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:44.500]
Because it's just so aggravating to me to listen to these people and I you know, I've been doing this a long long time

[00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:49.200]
And I'm worried the fact that everybody out there radio land thinks that wow we really know what's going on

[00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:51.720]
You don't know crap, you know this is squat, you know

[00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:54.060]
If you did know you'd probably blow your brains out

[00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:58.220]
God you probably like take your radio and bury it in the ground somewhere

[00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:02.260]
Seriously if they had any idea what this place is all a boot but you don't

[00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:08.300]
Well, listen to these idiots calling in Ellen and you know how right we are about certain things

[00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:12.220]
New England Paul who was the chronic factor and how come he won't read by faxes right now?

[00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:19.640]
He's become he's like one junior on the morning show. Yeah, they have to have the access. They have to have it in he had

[00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:23.600]
But not just access. He's like he he makes mark the death fans seem like

[00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:26.300]
You know, Gervhidal. I mean just it's just ludicrous

[00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:32.480]
With nothing to say the same crap every day just another chronic like I've always said the chronics on the fax machine

[00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:36.920]
Are the same as the chronics on the your phone and the chronics on the phone or the same as the chronics on the fact

[00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:41.360]
And generally it's the same people right is across over if I get another voice you will take their call anymore

[00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:43.060]
There's a factor factor involved there

[00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:48.480]
But anyway, David Miami says I like this. He says I remember after hearing rush check himself into the hospital

[00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:51.740]
He received thousands of emails supporting him since he's coming back Monday

[00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:55.700]
I decided to send him an email telling my do not support him only problem is you can't

[00:23:56.540 --> 00:24:00.920]
If you go on his website order to send him an email you must register in order to register

[00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:06.640]
You must buy either his newsletter tie coffee mug or some other item or maybe some oxy cotton would be good

[00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:12.900]
Therefore the only individuals who would send him an email are fans who buy his crap and of course all of the messages will be positive

[00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:15.860]
rushes like caster where they 100% approval rating

[00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:18.340]
I've got good parallel there man

[00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:23.240]
Says David and Miami excellent facts David keep it up. Keep up the good work. Who I would have you are

[00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:25.500]
Anyway, we'll give it the new pool

[00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:29.760]
And then the thing about I never got to the thing about the you see here

[00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:34.200]
I went through another whole segment your fault very smart because I was busy talking about Robert Creeper should have been fired

[00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:40.140]
But he'll never get fired because like I said um, he's got a good head on his shoulders. That's what Clarence said

[00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:44.300]
I said how come he ain't getting fired. He said good head on his shoulders

[00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:51.260]
27 past 10 at 560 absolutely wq and by the way more let me say it again

[00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:55.580]
They all hate you like poison. They don't like you. They can't stand you. They make you make them sick

[00:24:55.580 --> 00:25:00.840]
I like his new hat and everybody was especially grossed out by the fact that he really I mean all along

[00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:05.080]
Oh, who's the one who's the one who's your biggest supporter here who's the only the longest blah blah blah come on for all who we

[00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:11.500]
And he just was squeezing himself in fact. I hear he killed the muskrat he was so said he squeezed it so hard yesterday

[00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:12.840]
That's why I had to put the head on

[00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:15.380]
Yeah, I'm calling Peter

[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:17.320]
Bulger

[00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:22.420]
Anyway speaking of that, you know, and he left before we could get his new mattress

[00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:26.200]
That's the bad part about for our I want that mattress. I'm gonna. Yeah. I don't think he's gonna get it

[00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:31.280]
I saw fat boy wadlin in the hall on his walker this morning. You're tumbled right on his ass

[00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:38.460]
And I'm serious. He is brutal. He's in bad shape. He's a big fat tub. Hey fat boy. It's been nice knowing. I don't think I'll be seeing him again

[00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:39.780]
You know reminds me of tiny

[00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:42.100]
In our last last spring

[00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:47.500]
February I came home for a while a couple of months actually and I thought to myself when I live

[00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:49.740]
I don't think I'll be seeing tiny again alive

[00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:51.540]
We should start it off as pool

[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:56.500]
And you know what happened like on the 21st of February last year. He died my little dog

[00:25:57.060 --> 00:26:01.020]
He died and I'm thinking the same with fat boy my big fat friend

[00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:03.820]
I don't not think I'll be seeing him alive

[00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:07.640]
But unlike tiny who's probably his ashes are in a little canister

[00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:10.260]
Fat boy, there'll be in a piano case

[00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:12.120]
Just the ashes just the ashes

[00:26:12.620 --> 00:26:14.320]
Anyway, dollar mattress is where it's at

[00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:18.120]
If you want to get some good ash, this is the place to do it on a great mattress and dollar mattress

[00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:16.580]
And open this room and go to the bathroom.

[00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:24.780]
Yes, it's the wonderful world of radio.

[00:29:25.660 --> 00:29:26.700]
Ah, radio.

[00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:29.760]
Where you can hear your own voice.

[00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:36.040]
Let the WQAM school of broadcasting provide you with the essential tools you'll need

[00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:39.180]
to make your wet radio dreams come true.

[00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:42.060]
I mean a one-quam crew.

[00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:44.320]
We will lose you, Elora.

[00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:45.240]
Yeah, cool.

[00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:48.600]
1034, this is two at the 560 WQAM.

[00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:49.880]
Now what's that schedule look like today?

[00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:51.180]
We just have a bunch of blanks in there.

[00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:53.560]
No, it says a mad dog at two.

[00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:54.600]
The Humproot 4.

[00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:58.880]
It thinks again that mad dog at hang for their nervous contributions yesterday.

[00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:00.460]
Found our books and piece to abandon paper rescue.

[00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:01.020]
Thank you guys.

[00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:02.840]
And by the way, Hank, lose announce, will you?

[00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:05.620]
First time I've seen Hank in months, you know?

[00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:07.420]
And I don't know.

[00:30:07.660 --> 00:30:09.520]
He just said to me he's giving up on the way.

[00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:10.520]
It was good.

[00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:11.000]
That's that.

[00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:11.960]
He was big.

[00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:12.980]
And I love Hank.

[00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:16.220]
Hank's great, but he just maybe skipped like lunch.

[00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:18.020]
See what I'm saying?

[00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:18.580]
That's the start.

[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:19.520]
I know.

[00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:20.240]
I understand what he said.

[00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:21.640]
I just got to eat in a bunch of crap.

[00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:22.420]
Who the hell am I to talk?

[00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:23.380]
I didn't even want it.

[00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:25.400]
It was the furthest thing from my mind.

[00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:28.260]
There's all that stuff from how he's sitting on here.

[00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:29.020]
Did I look at it?

[00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:29.140]
No.

[00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:29.940]
Was I going to eat it?

[00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:30.740]
Did I touch it?

[00:30:30.740 --> 00:30:30.940]
No.

[00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:31.740]
No, in a food either.

[00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:31.960]
No.

[00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:34.800]
And all of a sudden, Troy Stratford, they just,

[00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:36.540]
that's another reason I cannot be here.

[00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:37.620]
They just want to horror me.

[00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:39.200]
They just want to use me and abuse me.

[00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:44.360]
And they just, you know, just stick a goddamn pump into my ass and keep stuffing the food in there, you know?

[00:30:46.860 --> 00:30:48.220]
45 votes on our new pool.

[00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:49.180]
I just went up on there.

[00:30:50.020 --> 00:30:52.200]
This is a chance because it'll be up there all weekend to vent.

[00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:53.400]
Once and for all.

[00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:56.480]
And then Monday we like kind of wipe the slate clean and we'll start out with whatever line.

[00:30:56.700 --> 00:30:57.900]
I think it's going to be pretty good though.

[00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:01.620]
I think we got the little dog and the big dog and the big dog and little dog.

[00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:03.240]
I think you're going to have some dogs in there, right?

[00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:05.200]
All dogs all day.

[00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:06.020]
Who let the dogs in.

[00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:06.520]
Dog radio.

[00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:11.680]
Anyway, what's your take on the firing of Scott Furell, which is not like either one of the pools we did yesterday?

[00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:14.480]
Oh, and I should, did I read the result of the other one?

[00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:15.580]
Not enough.

[00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:17.380]
I don't think he did.

[00:31:17.380 --> 00:31:23.440]
I did not, but I forgot to mention that Joe and Mark, you know, I love Joe Castello, but every time that he influences me to put them on a pool,

[00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:27.260]
and then they whipped their audience up overnight and the number goose, they almost caught the mad dog.

[00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:31.960]
Now as much as we like those guys, is there any comparison whatsoever?

[00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:32.720]
No.

[00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:36.600]
Oh, I see you're not saying a word because I love Joe.

[00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:37.140]
Yeah, okay.

[00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:37.580]
So good.

[00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:38.020]

[00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:39.740]
He's one of your customers.

[00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:42.600]
Anyway, what's your take on the firing of Scott Furell?

[00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:43.600]
I hated him anyway.

[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:45.260]
Greg reads an asshole.

[00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:47.400]
Well, see, that kind of is a given.

[00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:48.360]
I don't care.

[00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:49.220]
Never listen to him.

[00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:50.720]
Neil is much more vulgar.

[00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:54.460]
Is that one on there?

[00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:54.940]
Wait a minute.

[00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:57.820]
I don't think Eric maybe have left one out.

[00:31:58.100 --> 00:31:59.400]
Oh, no, it's on there, but don't have any votes.

[00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:01.320]
His voice nearly killed me.

[00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:02.380]
No great loss.

[00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:05.440]
The radio business blows, which of course, uh, absolutely.

[00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:06.120]
We know that.

[00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:06.940]
And he had it coming.

[00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:07.780]
He was over the top.

[00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:10.000]
Those are the, let's see, 368.

[00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:10.780]
Who do we appreciate?

[00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:13.880]
Great choices on our pool today as we try to like bring it back to some perspective.

[00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:14.820]
Let me just say this.

[00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:16.460]
So I don't forget to finish that story.

[00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:24.740]
Is that Wednesday morning, evidently, was kind of like the stride that broke the camels back in some of the crap that he said on the year.

[00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:27.660]
Even after he had said he wasn't going to be doing and talking about that stuff.

[00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:34.440]
And there was enormous stress and pressure and 8 million meetings and signing his documents that have been going on for weeks and months and months.

[00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:38.820]
And even at that point, he wasn't getting fired.

[00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:40.060]
He was being suspended.

[00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:46.780]
And his response to his impendant, and they were going to like let a day go by cool off.

[00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:47.200]
Come in here.

[00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:48.120]
We'll sit down and talk.

[00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:53.740]
But instead of that, on the phone, first, he abused our program director clearance, which is easy to do.

[00:32:53.740 --> 00:32:55.420]
But I mean, just abuse the crap bottom.

[00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:59.720]
And then our operations manager, Muff, he just...

[00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:05.720]
And the best part of the deal is that both of these two guys were guys who had been going to bad form and keeping him his job for weeks and weeks and weeks.

[00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:07.300]
This is what really frosted their ass.

[00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:14.980]
Is that in spite of tremendous pressure from ownership over in a West Coast, which you can understand, because they're under pressure with their license they need to protect.

[00:33:15.340 --> 00:33:17.620]
But in spite of that, he still goes and rips them on.

[00:33:17.620 --> 00:33:19.620]
And if I'm, ah, screw you, I'm going to hell, I'll see you in court.

[00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:21.360]
And a lot of things were worse than that.

[00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:22.220]
I won't repeat on the ear.

[00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:23.360]
That you can't repeat.

[00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:24.420]
But I can't repeat on the ear.

[00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:25.460]
And I don't know if I want to want to job.

[00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:29.460]
So that kind of like was the end.

[00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:32.180]
That no, that kind of like, that was the end.

[00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:37.840]
So for those people out there who think that they know something and we're calling in yesterday, oh gee, well you know.

[00:33:38.260 --> 00:33:42.680]
You and the other guys in your state, the other guys at a station, a lot of them haven't got a clue what they're talking about.

[00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:49.300]
You got Moa in the morning, who's got his agenda of screwing anybody you can, you know, stabbing in the back just to try to solidify his own position.

[00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:57.440]
You've got yours truly who sits here with no extra grind one way or the other on another for all situations who like the guy who promoted the hell out of the guy who enjoyed the crossovers every day.

[00:33:57.660 --> 00:33:59.360]
But I got to tell you the way it actually was.

[00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:00.980]
And a lot of you don't want to hear the truth.

[00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:05.200]
Because you can't handle the truth, speaking of technical sympathy, LA Kings, our leafs game.

[00:34:06.380 --> 00:34:09.140]
And then he had the mad dog on there, which he's entitled was opinion.

[00:34:09.140 --> 00:34:09.840]
And he liked the guy.

[00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:11.480]
You know, I like the guy too.

[00:34:11.740 --> 00:34:15.560]
I didn't maybe have as much interaction because I don't go to all those ball games and stuff.

[00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:18.680]
And mad dogs come at was he was always a gentleman.

[00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:20.920]
Every time they met they hit some nice conversations.

[00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:22.920]
He never stole a freight train. That's fine.

[00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:25.120]
But that's not what we're talking about.

[00:34:25.220 --> 00:34:26.840]
That's personal and we're talking about business.

[00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:27.640]
See?

[00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:30.560]
We're talking business and mad dog was talking personal.

[00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:35.260]
And I didn't hear Hank yesterday, so I don't know what he said on his show.

[00:34:35.720 --> 00:34:36.800]
So that's what I can tell you.

[00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:38.460]
I hear his word starts.

[00:34:38.460 --> 00:34:40.540]
What's your take on the firing of Scott Ferell?

[00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:45.160]
Greg Reads and Asshole, which I thought that was a given anyway, 36, 84 votes.

[00:34:45.180 --> 00:34:45.960]
That's what George voted.

[00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:47.460]
What?

[00:34:48.220 --> 00:34:49.500]
I think that's what you wasn't that what you voted?

[00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:50.460]
Mental.

[00:34:50.780 --> 00:34:51.460]
I don't care.

[00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:52.880]
Never listened to him, 13.

[00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:55.380]
That's 15.4%.

[00:34:55.380 --> 00:34:56.680]
No great loss, 10.

[00:34:57.520 --> 00:35:00.180]
The radio business blows Robert Creeper voted.

[00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:00.540]
Yeah.

[00:35:00.820 --> 00:35:00.940]
Yeah.

[00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:06.100]
Unless, of course, you've got a job guaranteed for life, Creeper, like you do.

[00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:06.960]
With your boyfriend.

[00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:07.640]
Absolutely.

[00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:08.780]
He had it coming.

[00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:10.100]
He was over the top six.

[00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:12.140]
His voice nearly killed me.

[00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:14.000]
Five, five people said that.

[00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:17.120]
I hated him anyway for and Neil is much more vulgar one.

[00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:20.380]
See, that's the thing I keep hearing a lot of these idiots these sports news calling.

[00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:21.760]
Well, I'll come Neil and get fired.

[00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:22.560]
He's much more vulgar.

[00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:25.300]
Let me say to you again, like I said yesterday, in case you missed the show.

[00:35:26.180 --> 00:35:29.780]
A year ago for anybody who, first of all, even backing up before then.

[00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:34.540]
If anybody knows about Jack Thompson and about what he can do to your career,

[00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:39.200]
to your life, to your, whatever kind of brain you used to have in your head, I know.

[00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:41.760]
Nobody in the world knows better than I know.

[00:35:42.820 --> 00:35:48.200]
Because I had two years of my life turned upside down by this great self-appointed moralist from heaven.

[00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:49.140]
Okay.

[00:35:49.340 --> 00:35:50.320]
So I know all about it.

[00:35:53.060 --> 00:35:58.160]
And then a year ago, we had the Congolesea business, which was another story.

[00:35:59.200 --> 00:35:59.440]
Right.

[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.300]
The two comedy bits we were playing to Bokobry and Bits, which we played over and over again.

[00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:06.020]
And about some outside right wing edged, today we decided to start up with us.

[00:36:06.140 --> 00:36:09.840]
The Fox News people picked it up and that we were getting all kinds of threats here at the radio station.

[00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:10.540]
We're going to do this.

[00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:14.280]
And so needless to say, I was under enormous pressure at that time.

[00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:17.560]
And it was made very clear to me that we aren't going to play those things no more.

[00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:22.160]
And if I did play those things, some more, I'd have my ass canned.

[00:36:22.540 --> 00:36:23.840]
And I said, okay.

[00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:25.080]
Gee.

[00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:26.560]
Because I'm an adult.

[00:36:26.740 --> 00:36:29.120]
I don't have any need to play those things anymore.

[00:36:29.540 --> 00:36:31.880]
And I'm not going to like shoot myself in the foot.

[00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:35.320]
I can use the cash, especially after my church.

[00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:37.860]
And that's just the way it is.

[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:38.580]
Life goes on.

[00:36:39.020 --> 00:36:44.620]
If you're a mature adult and you have like self-preservation as one of your goals, that's one of the things you do.

[00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:48.060]
When you work for people, they tell you, oh, this is something you're not going to do or buy by.

[00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:48.860]
You're saying, okay.

[00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:49.720]
And you don't do it.

[00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:51.220]
You mean you don't always say that.

[00:36:51.660 --> 00:36:53.780]
Especially when you don't have any need to do it.

[00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:56.580]
Do we have any need to play condolese?

[00:36:56.940 --> 00:36:57.120]
No.

[00:36:57.500 --> 00:36:57.660]
No.

[00:36:57.660 --> 00:36:57.660]

[00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:02.120]
That's my point, right there.

[00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:05.000]
Anyway, 20, what is it?

[00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:07.020]
18 before 11 at 5.60 QAM.

[00:37:08.140 --> 00:37:09.560]
I'm in law.

[00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:12.880]
This is 4.20 or 5.60 QAM.

[00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:13.420]
You way, yeah.

[00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:18.140]
Jenner the Herpes got you hurting.

[00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:24.340]
Ask your doctor about Vatret.

[00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:28.340]
Valtret.

[00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:30.200]
Because love hurts.

[00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:34.600]
Valtret.

[00:37:37.940 --> 00:37:38.380]
Absolutely.

[00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:40.780]
16 before 11 at 5.60 WQM.

[00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:41.700]
Happy Friday to you.

[00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:42.940]
122 votes.

[00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:44.080]
You should have seen the poll.

[00:37:44.180 --> 00:37:45.200]
Maybe it'll be that way again today.

[00:37:46.180 --> 00:37:51.760]
The way the votes were pouring in in on-person and we did over 2,000 votes on the two polls in one day yesterday.

[00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:54.080]
I think that since alien that's a record.

[00:37:54.540 --> 00:37:55.740]
Let's fire somebody else.

[00:37:55.980 --> 00:38:00.180]
I think that's a great idea.

[00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:01.180]
The firing of the wake.

[00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:03.960]
We had several suggestions for you yesterday by the way.

[00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:06.600]
By the way, George is here today.

[00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:08.440]
If you want to pick on him, feel free.

[00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:16.200]
That just amazes me because I know that after 100 years that I got a lot of people despise me out there.

[00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:20.020]
But you're much more polarizing than I am.

[00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:21.420]
Why is that?

[00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:22.900]
You're so bland.

[00:38:24.220 --> 00:38:25.900]
No, don't be put it off on me.

[00:38:26.420 --> 00:38:27.500]
A lot of people like you.

[00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:30.300]
But the ones who dislike you would like poison.

[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:32.700]
Hate you would such a vitriol.

[00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:35.040]
Maybe it's the spick factor.

[00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:38.580]
How do you know that they're Jews?

[00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:41.520]
Here's Miami.

[00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:41.800]
Hello.

[00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:45.240]
You ready?

[00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:48.600]
Yeah, okay.

[00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:49.580]
But your phone ain't ready.

[00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:50.360]
Okay, that's a problem.

[00:38:50.420 --> 00:38:51.880]
Underwater caller wants me to retire.

[00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:56.620]
560-50560, 0.560 on the AT&T.

[00:38:56.860 --> 00:38:57.900]
That was Pete Bulldozer's boyfriend.

[00:38:58.020 --> 00:38:58.680]
Recognize the voice.

[00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:00.580]
Come up for Eris Wheatheart.

[00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:02.500]
West Palm Beach.

[00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:02.760]
Hello.

[00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:02.820]
Hello.

[00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:04.980]
Yes, sir?

[00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:05.860]
Yes.

[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:09.120]
Why don't you get a black DJ there and I pray it just Jews stations.

[00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:10.560]
Why don't you really do?

[00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:12.000]
Yeah, get a black DJ.

[00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:13.140]
We don't have no DJs.

[00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:13.340]
Okay.

[00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:15.200]
Call a power and see what I don't do it.

[00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:16.560]
Get a white DJ.

[00:39:17.340 --> 00:39:17.680]
Get a life.

[00:39:18.820 --> 00:39:19.400]
Here's Miami.

[00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:19.720]
Hello.

[00:39:21.620 --> 00:39:21.980]
Miami.

[00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:23.820]
Good morning, Neil.

[00:39:23.940 --> 00:39:25.320]
Yes, Neil.

[00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:30.040]
Listen, there's a great anti-war song on the Wichita oblong.

[00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:32.440]
I can't see John McDonald on the fish.

[00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:33.620]
I don't know if you remember this guy.

[00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:38.000]
But if you change the words from Vietnam to a Rocky name,

[00:39:38.580 --> 00:39:42.220]
it would make a great song for nowadays with me to be right up to date.

[00:39:42.580 --> 00:39:43.840]
I don't know if you remember the song.

[00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:44.200]
Yes.

[00:39:44.860 --> 00:39:45.880]
One, two, three.

[00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:46.940]
What are we fighting for?

[00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:48.880]
One, two, three o'clock, four o'clock rock.

[00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:50.180]
Five, six, seven o'clock, yeah.

[00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:51.160]
Yeah, right.

[00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:51.860]
I'll hand it in the comments.

[00:39:52.140 --> 00:39:52.700]
He's dead too.

[00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:54.220]
Maybe Boca could do something.

[00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:55.320]
Maybe Boca can do something.

[00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:57.140]
Okay, we'll pass it along and have a great weekend.

[00:39:57.640 --> 00:39:58.100]
Okay, thank you.

[00:39:58.140 --> 00:39:58.400]
Bye-bye.

[00:39:58.400 --> 00:39:59.500]
Okay, a lot of open lines.

[00:39:59.580 --> 00:40:01.400]
I thought we'd get a phenomenal response here today,

[00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:04.040]
but they don't want to handle it now because they can't deal with the truth like I said.

[00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:06.120]
They'd rather have a visceral reaction.

[00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:08.960]
Ah, you guys are sucking all this other crap like yesterday.

[00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:10.580]
Calling in, sucking up, you know,

[00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:12.080]
to whoever happened to be the host at the moment.

[00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:14.420]
And as much as I love the mad dog, it's just,

[00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:17.760]
oh, when you're the only one, Jim, who really is telling it like it is,

[00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:18.780]
and you're the only one.

[00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:20.780]
Oh, man, I'm so tired of that crap.

[00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:23.460]
At least it is on this show.

[00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:25.300]
I mean, I'm not saying they don't get a little bit of, you know,

[00:40:26.060 --> 00:40:28.060]
hysteria and hate because that's an issue of the market.

[00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:30.880]
At least on this show, we get some hostile people,

[00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:33.560]
even a retire, you know, and it's a breadth of fresh air, really.

[00:40:34.460 --> 00:40:35.640]
Charge sucks, you know, whatever.

[00:40:36.180 --> 00:40:38.460]
As opposed to, oh, you are so right, you know,

[00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:40.260]
all this other bull crap, that's so boring.

[00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:41.600]
Ponderous.

[00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:43.860]
And that's because I've told you for years,

[00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:46.620]
most of the people that call radio talk shows are desperate,

[00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:50.920]
desperate people who just hope that somebody can validate their resistance under planet.

[00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:53.360]
Like the ones who call and say,

[00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:56.540]
well, don't you agree with me that, you know, whatever, fill in the blank?

[00:40:56.660 --> 00:40:58.920]
Don't you agree that I'm an asshole?

[00:40:59.100 --> 00:41:01.320]
Yeah, as a matter of fact, now that you mentioned it,

[00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:03.720]
here's a call from Bokeh, hello.

[00:41:03.940 --> 00:41:05.200]
That's a perfect leading for me.

[00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:06.280]
Neil, are you an asshole?

[00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:08.060]
No, my wife and I love your show.

[00:41:08.460 --> 00:41:11.040]
I'm a practicing psychiatrist that happened to be off today.

[00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:11.500]
Uh-huh.

[00:41:11.580 --> 00:41:17.360]
And I can't tell you how valuable it was to let the frill go very, very dangerous to,

[00:41:17.900 --> 00:41:19.420]
to, to, to, to, to any of the teenagers listening.

[00:41:19.980 --> 00:41:21.260]
Listen, my wife has been...

[00:41:21.260 --> 00:41:22.160]
What, what do you mean by that?

[00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:26.760]
Well, just the decadent, you know, it's one thing to have decadent.

[00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:31.280]
Uh, it's another thing to have decadent, so I think damage is a psyche when, when people...

[00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:33.000]
Damage is the psyche of the listeners?

[00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:34.480]
Actually, it's got a little bit over the top.

[00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:36.060]
Well, that's, that's my view.

[00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:37.960]
Is this the professional shrink who calls us?

[00:41:37.980 --> 00:41:38.580]
Yes, I have.

[00:41:38.580 --> 00:41:39.020]
Oh, okay.

[00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:41.960]
Yeah, I, I, that went through my mind before you even said that,

[00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:43.940]
because as soon as you said, I'm a psychiatrist, yeah.

[00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:46.360]
Go practice your asshura, go shrink it, okay?

[00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:48.000]
In fact, from what I'm hearing, it already shrunk.

[00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:50.940]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound fire.

[00:41:51.060 --> 00:41:52.960]
He's got one of them like them, Gene's, you know, pre- shrunk.

[00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:57.420]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound fire, 60 on EAT and T.

[00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:00.160]
Oh, yeah, terrorizing the teenagers out there.

[00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:01.500]
Ooh, man.

[00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:03.260]
Talk about over the top.

[00:42:03.380 --> 00:42:06.520]
Trace that call and let's get the straight check it in the butterfly net for this guy.

[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:08.020]
I'm telling you, I love it.

[00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:10.220]
I, this, I don't know when this started.

[00:42:10.220 --> 00:42:14.220]
Not many, many months ago, I had a whole new attitude about these callers.

[00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:15.520]
Yeah.

[00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:18.360]
Now, each and every one of them, and it's own bizarre way,

[00:42:18.660 --> 00:42:20.760]
and it's own sick twisted way, like him.

[00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:21.880]
That was great.

[00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:22.900]
Yeah, what?

[00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:24.860]
Each one of them has some redeeming social value.

[00:42:24.940 --> 00:42:28.220]
In fact, you can take a coupon with it to Publix and redeem it.

[00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:28.600]
Mm-hmm.

[00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:30.140]
Makes me feel better about myself today.

[00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:30.640]

[00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:32.300]
Hey, it's exactly what I'm thinking.

[00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:34.640]
153 votes.

[00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:37.240]
What's your take on the firing of Scott Furella?

[00:42:37.340 --> 00:42:39.360]
By the way, Greg has a message for these people who are voting.

[00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:40.140]
Greg hates you.

[00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:43.540]
Greg's an asshole, 64, 41.8%.

[00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:47.760]
Don't care, never listen to Furella, 26.

[00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:49.940]
The radio business blows 17.

[00:42:50.220 --> 00:42:53.600]
I don't know why I put that on there, but I guess that's kind of like a supporter Furella kind of thing,

[00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:55.860]
because he's gotten canned more times than you can say it.

[00:42:56.700 --> 00:42:57.800]
No great law, 17.

[00:42:58.180 --> 00:42:59.800]
He had it coming, he was over the top 12.

[00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:01.960]
His voice nearly killed me, nine.

[00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:06.180]
I hated him anyway, six, and Neil is much more vulgar, two.

[00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:11.240]
So far, you're going to see the polls have been up out about 20 minutes.

[00:43:11.540 --> 00:43:11.900]
Okay.

[00:43:13.340 --> 00:43:15.420]
I said the polls have been up there only about 20 minutes.

[00:43:15.540 --> 00:43:16.040]
Did you say K?

[00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:16.960]
Yeah.

[00:43:19.020 --> 00:43:20.920]
The 159 votes in 20 minutes.

[00:43:21.780 --> 00:43:25.080]
Multiply that time is three, and you've got 480 votes in an hour at this pace.

[00:43:25.420 --> 00:43:25.660]
Wow.

[00:43:26.220 --> 00:43:26.820]
Two, what do I mean?

[00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:28.840]
So I think you're onto something.

[00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:30.760]
The firing of the wake, sir, it's...

[00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:31.880]
Oh, by the way, Robert.

[00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:31.880]

[00:43:32.020 --> 00:43:32.520]
...reapers next.

[00:43:35.180 --> 00:43:35.900]
567-05.

[00:43:36.100 --> 00:43:36.760]
Never had to eat pound.

[00:43:37.020 --> 00:43:37.140]
What?

[00:43:37.380 --> 00:43:39.680]
That'll never have had that as long as clearance is the program director.

[00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:40.900]
What if clearance gets canned first?

[00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:41.420]
Ha!

[00:43:41.700 --> 00:43:42.600]
Now maybe you're out of something.

[00:43:43.540 --> 00:43:46.680]
But he did such a good job of getting me my check, not only on time, but ahead of time.

[00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:47.760]
How's your bonus coming up?

[00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:48.540]
Oh, yeah, it was just a good time.

[00:43:48.540 --> 00:43:49.180]
Already got mine!

[00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:51.580]
Got mine, George, or could use that for Christmas.

[00:43:51.740 --> 00:43:52.080]
Got mine!

[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:53.880]
Here's for Lauderdale.

[00:43:54.020 --> 00:43:54.160]
Hello.

[00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:55.520]
And Neil.

[00:43:56.020 --> 00:43:56.320]
Yes, sir.

[00:43:56.840 --> 00:43:58.520]
His voice was really annoying.

[00:43:58.520 --> 00:43:59.060]
Raspi.

[00:43:59.420 --> 00:43:59.780]
Yeah.

[00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:01.220]
It looked like a bad...

[00:44:02.180 --> 00:44:03.160]
Like a bad record.

[00:44:03.580 --> 00:44:05.540]
Yeah, like fingernails on a blackboard, that kind of thing?

[00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:06.440]
Yeah.

[00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:07.840]
I got a question for you.

[00:44:07.860 --> 00:44:08.120]
Go ahead.

[00:44:08.820 --> 00:44:13.860]
Up in Toronto, because Ron Wapel, he's a harness to be where he's going to drive.

[00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:16.080]
Yeah, not as much as he used to, but he's still a...

[00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:18.000]
His son Randy is a champion, and he's great.

[00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:18.840]
Who?

[00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:20.440]
Randy Wapel's his son.

[00:44:21.020 --> 00:44:22.160]
Oh, okay.

[00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:27.060]
Him and Chris Christoffer were the eating drivers in the Toronto Circuit, but Ron still drives some trodders known in.

[00:44:27.100 --> 00:44:27.600]
And he's still around.

[00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:30.360]
Now, do they still come down and eat the pompano?

[00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:33.340]
I don't think Ron comes down here anymore.

[00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:40.160]
All right, because I lived in a pretty old for a while, and actually my dad used to race horses at three old ants.

[00:44:40.180 --> 00:44:40.300]
Right.

[00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:42.860]
At the Battlelands, and I was just...

[00:44:42.860 --> 00:44:43.460]
Well, let me ask you this.

[00:44:43.580 --> 00:44:45.140]
Did you ever see an honest racer freehold?

[00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:47.080]
An honest one?

[00:44:47.220 --> 00:44:47.340]
Yeah.

[00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:48.080]
Well, think about it.

[00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:50.680]
5670560, pound 56...

[00:44:50.680 --> 00:44:51.280]
Just a joke.

[00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:52.580]
It's just a joke, Jackimo.

[00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:53.520]
I mean, Jackie Lee.

[00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:57.020]
5670560, pound 56...

[00:44:57.020 --> 00:44:59.300]
On the AT&T, let's start some harness racing talk.

[00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:00.260]
Eric Goudelle.

[00:45:00.780 --> 00:45:01.340]
How you doing, Eric?

[00:45:01.460 --> 00:45:03.360]
You're okay in my book, and spider-what Dick Feinberg says.

[00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:07.200]
And, or, as Dick Feinberg, I mentioned in Mike Mayows column two days ago.

[00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:08.080]
Or was it yesterday?

[00:45:08.260 --> 00:45:09.140]
I think yesterday morning.

[00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:11.340]
About the poker room and about the gambling.

[00:45:11.660 --> 00:45:12.900]
It's just a Yahoo state dick.

[00:45:13.020 --> 00:45:14.380]
Okay, I forgot to tell you that the other night.

[00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:17.680]
Oh, and let me tell you about my night at that rich...

[00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:18.740]
It's the track the other night.

[00:45:18.900 --> 00:45:19.080]
Okay.

[00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:19.680]
Oh.

[00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:23.000]
5670560, pound 56...

[00:45:24.940 --> 00:45:27.740]
On the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line.

[00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:29.720]
In fact, it gave new meaning to that old expression.

[00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:32.860]
Do you know what's the expression I'm talking about?

[00:45:32.940 --> 00:45:34.640]
You know, fat rich reminds me of my mother.

[00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:35.100]
That one.

[00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:36.340]
Good to see you, Rich.

[00:45:36.540 --> 00:45:37.220]
Keep losing that weight.

[00:45:38.860 --> 00:45:39.600]
Here's Lake Worth.

[00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:39.840]
Hello.

[00:45:40.940 --> 00:45:41.720]
Hello, Neil.

[00:45:42.020 --> 00:45:42.440]
Yes, sir.

[00:45:43.060 --> 00:45:44.720]
It's Veggie from Lake Worth.

[00:45:45.220 --> 00:45:45.860]
Oh, no.

[00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:47.700]
I'm so listening, Neil.

[00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:49.100]
I'll be damned. Where the hell you been?

[00:45:49.620 --> 00:45:50.900]
I've been under the rocker.

[00:45:51.020 --> 00:45:51.680]
I finally came out.

[00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:53.960]
This is Veggie who used to be Veggie from Boko,

[00:45:54.080 --> 00:45:56.520]
who's now a Veggie from Lake Worth because he's getting a lot older.

[00:45:57.500 --> 00:45:59.940]
Yeah, getting older, moving north, you know how to have it.

[00:46:00.020 --> 00:46:00.200]
Right.

[00:46:01.340 --> 00:46:02.360]
Still not being Canada.

[00:46:03.540 --> 00:46:04.420]
I sure hope not.

[00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:06.280]
I have a good one now.

[00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:07.480]
Okay, Veggie, nice hearing from you.

[00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:08.960]
I can see you got your usual great material.

[00:46:09.780 --> 00:46:10.520]
See, there's a guy.

[00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:11.920]
It's Veggie from Lake Worth.

[00:46:12.100 --> 00:46:12.880]
Did he have anything to say?

[00:46:12.980 --> 00:46:13.100]
No.

[00:46:13.220 --> 00:46:13.920]
Just call to say hello.

[00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:16.440]
Just call it kind of like, hey, Jared, it's Toby checking in.

[00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:18.940]
That's where we're going to start doing.

[00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:20.460]
We're going to have check-ins, okay?

[00:46:20.460 --> 00:46:22.720]
And believe you me, the way this place is going lately,

[00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:23.940]
we ought to start with check-ins.

[00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:27.280]
80 people say Greg reads an asshole.

[00:46:28.180 --> 00:46:28.900]
Absolutely correct.

[00:46:29.180 --> 00:46:29.920]
Shame on you, Greg.

[00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:32.100]
And I'll say it again because I told it like it was yesterday

[00:46:32.100 --> 00:46:34.280]
in spite of all the bull crap that I was hearing on the other show.

[00:46:36.260 --> 00:46:37.820]
Greg made the problem.

[00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:39.460]
He created it.

[00:46:40.180 --> 00:46:42.840]
By busting up the first team, I said to him a hundred times

[00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:44.600]
if it's not broke, don't fix it.

[00:46:44.700 --> 00:46:45.540]
Don't mess with success.

[00:46:45.820 --> 00:46:46.560]
Everything's going great.

[00:46:46.820 --> 00:46:49.580]
He messed with it and for two years now.

[00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:53.040]
He's still been trying to undo the mess he made.

[00:46:53.420 --> 00:46:56.140]
Like if your dog had a big wild diarrhea on the floor

[00:46:56.140 --> 00:46:57.220]
and it took you two years.

[00:46:57.880 --> 00:47:00.040]
20 visits by dry concepts and all the other

[00:47:00.040 --> 00:47:02.280]
cleaning equipment in the world to try to clean it up.

[00:47:02.740 --> 00:47:03.500]
And that's what he's doing.

[00:47:03.820 --> 00:47:10.300]
Try to put the pieces together, the big egg that he cracked like punky punky punky punky punky punky punky punky punky.

[00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:13.940]
And not only that, but what did I say when they brought Pharrell in here?

[00:47:14.960 --> 00:47:18.540]
At a time we had just not that long ago gone through all the condolese of business

[00:47:18.540 --> 00:47:22.200]
and all the threats to the license and all this bent out of shape hysteria.

[00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:22.840]
Oh my god.

[00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:26.900]
And then he brings a guy in here and some callers made this point and I agree with it.

[00:47:27.180 --> 00:47:29.700]
It's very much like ESPN and Rush Limbaugh.

[00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:33.800]
When they brought him in, they knew he's a racist piece of tub right wing crap.

[00:47:34.040 --> 00:47:37.360]
So why should it surprise me that I'll read this comment about Donovan McNabb?

[00:47:38.500 --> 00:47:39.400]
They brought him in.

[00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:40.180]
They knew what they were going to get.

[00:47:40.320 --> 00:47:42.400]
And oh gee, you know, and the same thing here.

[00:47:42.700 --> 00:47:44.620]
What did they think they were going to get when Pharrell?

[00:47:44.660 --> 00:47:45.360]
Was he going to change?

[00:47:46.620 --> 00:47:47.940]
Wasn't that going to clean up?

[00:47:48.020 --> 00:47:48.540]
Of course not.

[00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:52.040]
It's like if you bring out, go on, and bring a wild animal in the house and say,

[00:47:52.180 --> 00:47:55.280]
oh gee, he's crapping all over the house and I just can't get him to calm down.

[00:47:55.800 --> 00:47:56.820]
I can't imagine why.

[00:47:57.660 --> 00:47:59.860]
In fact, I think there's a great similarity there.

[00:47:59.940 --> 00:48:01.100]
I think it describes the situation.

[00:48:02.220 --> 00:48:03.940]
Yeah, I think you got a good point there, Neil.

[00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:05.180]
Yeah, I got a good point.

[00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:08.420]
Here's Miami. Hello.

[00:48:10.420 --> 00:48:10.740]
Miami.

[00:48:11.080 --> 00:48:11.660]
Yes, sir.

[00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:17.840]
Listen, on that survey, you know, there's some of us that actually like that guy.

[00:48:18.740 --> 00:48:19.260]
What do you mean?

[00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:22.600]
Well, I mean, I drive around, you know.

[00:48:22.660 --> 00:48:23.660]
You mean talking about Pharrell?

[00:48:23.820 --> 00:48:24.420]
Right, yeah.

[00:48:24.440 --> 00:48:27.340]
Well, that's why we've got, it's leading with the Greg Reads and Asshole.

[00:48:27.540 --> 00:48:30.180]
Maybe you didn't understand the Greg Reads, the General Manager.

[00:48:30.440 --> 00:48:33.100]
So that's the one, yeah, well, no, not just in everything.

[00:48:33.400 --> 00:48:35.800]
It's just that I thought maybe there should have been one on there.

[00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:38.940]
You know, something like, well, we actually like the guy.

[00:48:38.940 --> 00:48:40.400]
No, no, that's why we said that.

[00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:42.140]
And also the radio business blows there too.

[00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:44.060]
Very obvious categories that are a vent.

[00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:45.560]
Now, now maybe I didn't word them well.

[00:48:45.560 --> 00:48:47.200]
Oh, I think they did because they're getting a lot of votes.

[00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:48.420]
But that's what those are for.

[00:48:48.660 --> 00:48:52.140]
Oh, okay, because you know, I listen to you and I listen to him.

[00:48:52.720 --> 00:48:54.880]
And he has me laughing so hard.

[00:48:55.080 --> 00:48:57.080]
Hey, listen, I'm going to tell you I said this yesterday.

[00:48:57.320 --> 00:48:58.720]
I said again, I enjoyed following him.

[00:48:58.720 --> 00:48:59.560]
We had a great crossover.

[00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:00.580]
We had a good time here together.

[00:49:00.780 --> 00:49:01.880]
I didn't have any problem with him.

[00:49:02.220 --> 00:49:03.700]
But the fact is, he's his own worst enemy.

[00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:05.520]
Listen, it can't just speak.

[00:49:05.620 --> 00:49:07.460]
I've coincident that he keeps getting canned everywhere.

[00:49:07.460 --> 00:49:09.180]
He goes, you think it's just a coincidence?

[00:49:09.580 --> 00:49:13.760]
No, no, in fact, in fact, when I would listen to him before they toned him down some.

[00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:14.020]
Right.

[00:49:14.220 --> 00:49:16.620]
I used to wonder how long he's going to be.

[00:49:16.620 --> 00:49:17.360]
Right, exactly.

[00:49:17.740 --> 00:49:18.040]
You know?

[00:49:18.460 --> 00:49:21.920]
And the problem is, like with a lot of other people, he would tone it down for a couple of days.

[00:49:22.020 --> 00:49:24.580]
And then all of a sudden, when he leaves his expected, boom, there you go again.

[00:49:24.620 --> 00:49:25.380]
He would blow up again.

[00:49:25.480 --> 00:49:28.460]
That's sad because I wish we could have kept it going.

[00:49:28.580 --> 00:49:30.900]
I was having a good time and I think a lot of other people here were too.

[00:49:31.180 --> 00:49:34.240]
Yeah, it was a good time and I'm going to miss him.

[00:49:35.020 --> 00:49:36.560]
Well, we'll see what happens.

[00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:37.420]
Yeah, I guess so.

[00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:38.820]
It's a horse ball business.

[00:49:39.460 --> 00:49:40.220]
Have a great day.

[00:49:40.380 --> 00:49:41.100]
Thanks for taking my time.

[00:49:41.100 --> 00:49:41.480]
Thank you.

[00:49:41.620 --> 00:49:42.380]
Thanks for making your call.

[00:49:44.320 --> 00:49:45.560]
56670560, pound 560.

[00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:46.060]
It is.

[00:49:46.100 --> 00:49:46.880]
It's a horrible business.

[00:49:47.060 --> 00:49:48.700]
I've been telling you people that for a long time.

[00:49:49.320 --> 00:49:53.880]
But Scott, and I'm positive you're listening now unless he's concerning on some of their station or plotting or planning.

[00:49:54.560 --> 00:50:00.060]
You know, I don't even know why I'm going to say it because I tried telling him to be right in here when he'd come in here during his breaks.

[00:50:01.020 --> 00:50:03.680]
All this week, Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday morning, I tried telling him that.

[00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:11.160]
I tried telling that from Toronto when he'd come in here in the morning in the early hours on his breaks when we'd converse when we would be verbal intercourse back and forth.

[00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:14.400]
I told him that on the air a million times.

[00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:17.700]
If I told him once on the air, I told him.

[00:50:18.680 --> 00:50:21.680]
Just take the money to the bank, do whatever they tell you and have a good time.

[00:50:21.880 --> 00:50:22.240]
That's all.

[00:50:23.020 --> 00:50:23.660]
Tone it down.

[00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:25.500]
If that's what they want, tone it down.

[00:50:26.580 --> 00:50:28.860]
Staying a few extra words on here isn't...

[00:50:28.860 --> 00:50:31.200]
I mean, it's like proven to points like being a hard ass.

[00:50:31.700 --> 00:50:32.520]
Being a hard ass.

[00:50:32.520 --> 00:50:36.940]
You're not going to tell me what to say and screw you, Duffin, stick it up your butt, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, yeah.

[00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:38.460]
You know, what is that?

[00:50:39.500 --> 00:50:46.280]
Not to mention the stuff that evidently was going on off the air, which also some of those people who were calling them out of the Augusta Day weren't privy too.

[00:50:46.520 --> 00:50:47.780]
And neither was I until this morning.

[00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:55.340]
So like I said, it's very easy to be an armchair quarterback, just like the experts on there on these ball games they call them in the station around the clock 20 hours a day.

[00:50:55.980 --> 00:50:59.900]
But in this particular case, there may have been a little bit more there than meets the old eye.

[00:50:59.900 --> 00:51:06.360]
Why, why, and local, your sports radio 560, you and you and you, and you.

[00:51:07.380 --> 00:51:09.620]
By the way, you bastards.

[00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:11.880]
Thank you.

[00:51:13.340 --> 00:51:15.400]
Thank you very much.

[00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:15.940]
Sure.

[00:51:16.820 --> 00:51:17.700]
I did it.

[00:51:18.900 --> 00:51:20.920]
I Germany, the K-David's.

[00:51:22.560 --> 00:51:25.140]
I am the covenator.

[00:51:26.300 --> 00:51:27.320]
Thank you.

[00:51:27.320 --> 00:51:32.120]
It's time to say, has the minister to California's problems.

[00:51:32.760 --> 00:51:38.500]
First of all, I like to thank my worthy opponents, Ariana Harvington.

[00:51:39.980 --> 00:51:40.400]
Thank you.

[00:51:40.960 --> 00:51:46.500]
Thank you for making my silly accent sound normal compared to your silly accent.

[00:51:48.420 --> 00:51:49.660]
Cruz, Bustamante.

[00:51:50.460 --> 00:51:53.400]
There's a place for you in my administration.

[00:51:54.480 --> 00:51:57.600]
I need someone to model on it that Covenants mentioned.

[00:51:59.980 --> 00:52:04.460]
And Carrie Coleman, there's a position for you in my cabinet.

[00:52:05.240 --> 00:52:06.660]
Get my medicine cabinet.

[00:52:07.740 --> 00:52:10.240]
Just don't tie any of the stubby in there.

[00:52:10.800 --> 00:52:11.120]
Get it?

[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:12.920]
Thank you.

[00:52:13.220 --> 00:52:20.780]
But seriously, seriously, my first day in office, a plan to announce some broad reaching initiatives.

[00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:22.400]
That's right.

[00:52:22.940 --> 00:52:26.260]
I'll initiate the plan to reach out and touch a bunch of broads.

[00:52:29.980 --> 00:52:34.300]
And lastly, I would like to thank my lovely white Maria.

[00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:39.140]
She should serve as a role model for all Californians.

[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:46.380]
During my term as Covener, while you're getting screwed, just lay there and tell me I'm doing a good job.

[00:52:48.320 --> 00:52:49.160]
Thank you.

[00:52:50.040 --> 00:52:51.020]
Thank you very much.

[00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:52.020]
I'll be back.

[00:52:54.580 --> 00:52:56.060]
You have to go to a 560.

[00:52:56.220 --> 00:52:59.340]
I added another register to an error, another category for the poll.

[00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:01.580]
Because the guy that called the truck driving guy, he's right.

[00:53:01.840 --> 00:53:06.220]
I never thought about that because I thought that I had a couple of, you know, but they don't always understand it.

[00:53:06.520 --> 00:53:07.200]
It's too indirect.

[00:53:07.560 --> 00:53:08.700]
So I added, I'm pissed.

[00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:09.560]
I love Ferell.

[00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:10.380]
Okay.

[00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:10.700]
All right.

[00:53:11.180 --> 00:53:11.860]
That's pretty direct.

[00:53:12.300 --> 00:53:12.700]
I'm pissed.

[00:53:12.800 --> 00:53:13.720]
I loved Ferell.

[00:53:13.960 --> 00:53:14.700]
Okay, you got it.

[00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:16.160]
All right.

[00:53:16.660 --> 00:53:19.880]
200 and, uh, boy, a lot of votes, man, in a half an hour, George.

[00:53:21.500 --> 00:53:23.080]
241 votes in a half an hour.

[00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:24.400]
Aren't you impressed?

[00:53:25.020 --> 00:53:25.160]
Quite.

[00:53:25.660 --> 00:53:29.200]
Greg reads an asshole 105, talk about restating the obvious.

[00:53:29.380 --> 00:53:30.240]
43 and a half percent.

[00:53:30.540 --> 00:53:30.940]
I don't care.

[00:53:31.020 --> 00:53:32.740]
I never listened to him 35, meaning Ferell.

[00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:34.840]
What's your take on the firing of Scott Ferell's the question?

[00:53:35.260 --> 00:53:37.400]
The radio business blows 26.

[00:53:37.960 --> 00:53:38.580]
No great loss.

[00:53:38.820 --> 00:53:39.220]
24.

[00:53:39.620 --> 00:53:40.180]
He ended coming.

[00:53:40.180 --> 00:53:41.320]
He was over the top 22.

[00:53:41.780 --> 00:53:42.920]
His voice nearly killed me.

[00:53:43.020 --> 00:53:43.280]
15.

[00:53:43.540 --> 00:53:44.360]
That's what Phyllis said.

[00:53:44.360 --> 00:53:45.280]
It's water Nazi.

[00:53:46.100 --> 00:53:46.360]
What?

[00:53:46.920 --> 00:53:47.280]
Nothing.

[00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:48.300]
Was my mic on?

[00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:50.720]
Uh, I hated him anyway nine.

[00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:55.040]
Neil is much more vulgar for, and we just put on Pistyle of Ferell and it's got one vote already.

[00:53:55.560 --> 00:53:56.660]
To try to be a little more direct.

[00:53:58.420 --> 00:54:03.020]
Radio talk show host John Matthews has been a fixture of the Houston broadcast scene for more than a decade.

[00:54:05.580 --> 00:54:07.200]
This is a right-winger, by the way.

[00:54:07.740 --> 00:54:14.140]
Was indicted by a Fort Bend grand jury on a charge of indecency with the child, this enrichment Virginia.

[00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:17.840]
The indictment which was unsealed Wednesday after Matthews was arrested,

[00:54:18.040 --> 00:54:23.500]
Matthews knowingly and intentionally exposed it to a girl under the age of 17, October 9.

[00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:29.780]
The indictment ledges there was exposure, but no contact with the child Fort Bend County District Attorney John Healy said.

[00:54:30.080 --> 00:54:34.920]
The conservative talk show host who also writes a column for a Fort Bend Virginia weekly newspaper

[00:54:34.920 --> 00:54:38.940]
was taken into custody by Sugarland police about 3pm and driven to police headquarters.

[00:54:39.400 --> 00:54:43.820]
Transferred to Cali Jail and Richmond, he was released on $10,000 personal reconnaissance bond.

[00:54:44.420 --> 00:54:46.960]
Made no statements to reporters as he left jail Wednesday evening.

[00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:48.960]
His attorney also declined to comment.

[00:54:50.720 --> 00:54:56.380]
Uh, the officer delivered him to jail after 5pm lowered the sunbises of his car as he pulled into the facility

[00:54:56.380 --> 00:54:59.060]
to prevent news photographers from taking Matthews pitcher.

[00:54:59.600 --> 00:55:04.620]
The outspoken Matthews has been a constant critic of liberals Bill Clinton and Houston Mayor Lee Browns.

[00:55:04.620 --> 00:55:09.040]
The administration resigned from his post at KSEV AM700.

[00:55:10.740 --> 00:55:15.320]
Matthews often opened the segments of his show with the instrumental piece, Rebel Rouser by Dwayne Eddie,

[00:55:15.720 --> 00:55:17.560]
and had loyal following the list of his who called the show frequently.

[00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:18.600]
Lot of good old boys.

[00:55:19.200 --> 00:55:25.180]
Lot of them boys that Howard Dean was talking about, them Confederate flag, wave and pickup truck driving, etc.

[00:55:25.820 --> 00:55:26.020]
Guys.

[00:55:27.160 --> 00:55:31.120]
Station owner Dan Patrick told listeners Wednesday the station will conduct a search for a placement.

[00:55:31.120 --> 00:55:35.420]
Oh, we know that a nationwide search outfit that probably get like what's his name that we just have in the morning there.

[00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:36.700]
The, um, what's his name?

[00:55:36.860 --> 00:55:38.940]
Sonny Fox's old guy Ron Ron Hershey harway.

[00:55:39.700 --> 00:55:41.100]
He maintains his innocence.

[00:55:42.680 --> 00:55:45.520]
Let's see, does it have any more information in here about this?

[00:55:45.660 --> 00:55:47.820]
I have a libel suit file against him.

[00:55:49.720 --> 00:55:56.280]
The investigation began last month after an allegation against Matthews and made the investigation began after the girls' parents contacted police to an intermediary.

[00:55:56.340 --> 00:55:58.580]
He declined to discuss details of the case.

[00:55:58.580 --> 00:55:59.280]
So there you go.

[00:55:59.420 --> 00:56:04.400]
The only reason I mentioned is because it's a conservative holier than I've talked to your host once again.

[00:56:04.620 --> 00:56:05.600]
It always seems to be the case.

[00:56:06.060 --> 00:56:09.660]
Just like Rush with all of them pills who will be back on Monday all you did who heads out there.

[00:56:09.940 --> 00:56:11.420]
La tada tada tada tada tada tada tada tada tada tada tada tada tada.

[00:56:11.420 --> 00:56:11.920]
Can't wait.

[00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:18.600]
Whenever he's great in the sunshine state when Rush comes back and they can say, oh, you're the best Rush.

[00:56:18.760 --> 00:56:20.080]
We feel so sorry for you.

[00:56:20.200 --> 00:56:20.560]
Absolutely.

[00:56:20.980 --> 00:56:21.140]
Right.

[00:56:21.460 --> 00:56:21.940]
He's a victim.

[00:56:22.160 --> 00:56:27.280]
He's just a victim of that doctor who got him hooked on him, Oxycontin's and then Laura sets in all other crap.

[00:56:29.400 --> 00:56:32.660]
Once you take on the firing of Scott Furell, we got a lot of votes, man.

[00:56:33.580 --> 00:56:33.940]
253.

[00:56:34.260 --> 00:56:35.680]
I bet you were over 300 in an hour.

[00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:36.900]
Wow.

[00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:37.500]
That's something.

[00:56:38.140 --> 00:56:38.760]
Isn't that amazing?

[00:56:39.140 --> 00:56:40.720]
You'll see we got 25 minutes to go.

[00:56:41.160 --> 00:56:45.900]
So if you people really put your nose to the grindstone in your keyboard and put your nose on your mouse.

[00:56:47.060 --> 00:56:49.780]
Once you take on the firing of Scott Furell, 253 votes.

[00:56:50.320 --> 00:56:51.560]
Greg Reads an asshole, 108.

[00:56:52.020 --> 00:56:52.360]
I don't care.

[00:56:52.480 --> 00:56:54.620]
I never listened to him 36th Radio Business Blows 26.

[00:56:54.620 --> 00:56:55.280]
No great loss 25th.

[00:56:55.660 --> 00:56:56.400]
He had a coming.

[00:56:56.460 --> 00:56:57.540]
He was over the top 22.

[00:56:57.900 --> 00:56:59.160]
His voice nearly killed me 15.

[00:56:59.700 --> 00:57:00.960]
I hated him any way nine.

[00:57:01.220 --> 00:57:01.800]
I'm pissed.

[00:57:01.980 --> 00:57:02.900]
I love Furell, eight.

[00:57:03.160 --> 00:57:03.920]
See, that's moving up.

[00:57:04.180 --> 00:57:06.160]
And he was much more vulnerable, or vulgar only four.

[00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:08.820]
So you have heard, and must be the same four I heard calling in a station.

[00:57:09.060 --> 00:57:10.100]
I don't know where they come up with that crap.

[00:57:11.240 --> 00:57:15.000]
Oh, and I, oh, that's what really frosted me a little bit with my good friend, the mad dog.

[00:57:15.020 --> 00:57:15.440]
Oh, right.

[00:57:15.620 --> 00:57:21.200]
Because the guy who I heard the first one called him said, oh, well, there's nothing that he said on the year while he was here that.

[00:57:21.740 --> 00:57:24.200]
Neil and Howard wouldn't have said themselves.

[00:57:25.400 --> 00:57:26.440]
Howard David, right.

[00:57:26.660 --> 00:57:27.020]
More Howard.

[00:57:27.620 --> 00:57:27.980]
Yeah.

[00:57:28.960 --> 00:57:30.760]
And mad dog said, yep, you're right.

[00:57:31.940 --> 00:57:32.900]
Or something like that.

[00:57:33.120 --> 00:57:34.280]
I think he said, oh, right.

[00:57:34.560 --> 00:57:35.780]
Because he's always saying, oh, right.

[00:57:36.920 --> 00:57:40.140]
And I thought to myself, well, whatever you say, Mr. Mad Dog, I love you.

[00:57:40.220 --> 00:57:41.560]
You're a great guy, but you're full of crap.

[00:57:43.640 --> 00:57:44.780]
Here's a call from Weston.

[00:57:44.840 --> 00:57:45.000]
Hello.

[00:57:45.740 --> 00:57:46.420]
Hello, Neil.

[00:57:46.580 --> 00:57:47.000]
Yes, sir.

[00:57:47.520 --> 00:57:48.540]
Hi, this is Alan.

[00:57:48.540 --> 00:57:49.200]
Hey, Alan.

[00:57:49.400 --> 00:57:53.180]
Hey, listen, I just wanted to, uh, collect, you know, that I do miss for real.

[00:57:53.200 --> 00:57:55.820]
I think for real was, uh, for real was funny as hell.

[00:57:55.880 --> 00:57:56.120]
Right.

[00:57:56.740 --> 00:57:57.100]
Okay.

[00:57:57.340 --> 00:58:01.480]
And, uh, you know, the only thing is that I don't want you to say is the wrong way.

[00:58:01.660 --> 00:58:06.400]
But most of the time I hear you, I only hear you talking about his lamb blast and all your callers.

[00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:08.680]
And I don't actually get what your form at is.

[00:58:08.920 --> 00:58:09.220]
Yeah.

[00:58:09.440 --> 00:58:09.700]
Okay.

[00:58:09.820 --> 00:58:12.140]
Now, maybe, maybe I'm just naive, but.

[00:58:12.300 --> 00:58:13.140]
Well, let me ask you something.

[00:58:13.640 --> 00:58:16.080]
How long are you, how long are you, I bet you're pardoned?

[00:58:16.080 --> 00:58:19.460]
I found for else to be much more interesting and entertaining than me.

[00:58:19.840 --> 00:58:21.020]
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

[00:58:21.180 --> 00:58:22.380]
Yeah, how long have you been listening to this show?

[00:58:23.760 --> 00:58:26.500]
Off and on for about, uh, okay.

[00:58:26.640 --> 00:58:30.380]
Well, honestly, yeah, just, okay, the past, just the past couple of months.

[00:58:30.400 --> 00:58:34.200]
But I've heard you show before, but I never really was into talk radio.

[00:58:34.380 --> 00:58:34.560]
Yeah.

[00:58:34.820 --> 00:58:37.660]
Well, you're, you're entirely your opinion.

[00:58:37.780 --> 00:58:38.520]
You like whatever you like.

[00:58:38.520 --> 00:58:40.700]
Like you may like vanilla ice cream and I like a rocky road.

[00:58:40.700 --> 00:58:42.940]
But the fact that it matters, I've been doing it here for 28 years.

[00:58:43.320 --> 00:58:46.160]
So I must be doing something other than just lamb basting with callers, you know.

[00:58:46.520 --> 00:58:48.320]
I haven't been just ripping callers for 28 years.

[00:58:48.320 --> 00:58:50.700]
I think you must have had a very good show.

[00:58:50.700 --> 00:58:52.280]
Oh, yeah, once upon a time it was a good show.

[00:58:52.460 --> 00:58:53.700]
I'm not a much, most of the time I hear you.

[00:58:53.840 --> 00:58:56.460]
You're lambasting all your dollars to all of the media in concert.

[00:58:56.760 --> 00:59:00.980]
And let me ask you, have you heard, Alan, have you heard the callers?

[00:59:02.160 --> 00:59:03.240]
Yeah, well, so do March.

[00:59:03.400 --> 00:59:04.100]
Okay, thank you.

[00:59:05.540 --> 00:59:07.660]
5670560, pound 560 on the AT&T.

[00:59:07.760 --> 00:59:08.940]
There's another expert on this program.

[00:59:08.940 --> 00:59:09.800]
Alan, have a great day.

[00:59:10.040 --> 00:59:11.200]
If you like throughout better, great.

[00:59:11.400 --> 00:59:12.260]
There are people like him better.

[00:59:12.320 --> 00:59:13.120]
People didn't like him at all.

[00:59:13.320 --> 00:59:14.000]
It's a matter of taste.

[00:59:14.140 --> 00:59:15.220]
I'm not here competing with him.

[00:59:15.600 --> 00:59:17.100]
Although I do think that was in his mind.

[00:59:17.180 --> 00:59:18.580]
I think that was a part of our problem.

[00:59:19.720 --> 00:59:20.000]
Why?

[00:59:20.160 --> 00:59:21.160]
You're not on opposite each other.

[00:59:21.180 --> 00:59:22.320]
No, I understand that.

[00:59:22.400 --> 00:59:24.440]
But it was always, well, I'm going to get triple numbers you've got.

[00:59:24.540 --> 00:59:25.640]
I'm going to show you because I'm the bet.

[00:59:25.720 --> 00:59:26.500]
You know, then that's fine.

[00:59:26.660 --> 00:59:28.080]
They have a big ego.

[00:59:28.260 --> 00:59:29.420]
But I mean an enormous ego.

[00:59:29.520 --> 00:59:31.320]
Here we did have a gigantic out of control ego.

[00:59:31.900 --> 00:59:32.080]
You know?

[00:59:32.320 --> 00:59:32.460]
Yeah.

[00:59:32.860 --> 00:59:36.500]
And when you talk a big game like that, you better produce a 5, 6 ain't going to cut it.

[00:59:36.500 --> 00:59:37.340]
I mean, it was a good number.

[00:59:37.740 --> 00:59:40.420]
And of course it was during a book that the station had all the way around it.

[00:59:40.500 --> 00:59:40.660]
He wrote.

[00:59:41.100 --> 00:59:41.700]
And he helped that.

[00:59:41.880 --> 00:59:42.260]
No question.

[00:59:42.800 --> 00:59:44.280]
It's a good idea to stay on long enough too.

[00:59:44.280 --> 00:59:48.400]
Yeah, it's a good thing to stay on any station long enough to really show you can produce something.

[00:59:48.680 --> 00:59:51.760]
But when you keep getting canned after a short period of time because you can't total line,

[00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:54.140]
or it can't even come close to the line, then you've got a problem.

[00:59:55.800 --> 00:59:57.060]
See, I don't know what I have.

[00:59:57.160 --> 00:59:58.400]
What I've said that wasn't clear enough.

[00:59:58.560 --> 01:00:02.500]
I guess there is a segment of the audience out there would like me to come on and just land-based management and say,

[01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:04.900]
boy, they really made a bad mistake this time.

[01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:07.320]
And I can't understand what they did.

[01:00:08.460 --> 01:00:10.520]
And like I said, the guy wasn't going to get fired anyway.

[01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:11.580]
He was going to be suspended.

[01:00:11.940 --> 01:00:13.820]
And there was still a chance to salvage a situation.

[01:00:14.180 --> 01:00:17.180]
You know, and this guy had more, even they ever ready, cats only got nine lives.

[01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:17.700]
Our medic.

[01:00:17.700 --> 01:00:19.580]
You know, it has management that they have to answer.

[01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:20.140]
That is correct.

[01:00:20.300 --> 01:00:24.120]
The people who own the goddamn license, that is correct, such as they are with their band-you-up in the tree.

[01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:25.640]
And that's them.

[01:00:27.220 --> 01:00:29.300]
And you can only push a situation so far.

[01:00:29.300 --> 01:00:34.520]
And when the people who have helped you to stay employed and keep your paycheck coming every two weeks,

[01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:38.380]
are on the phone trying to say, hey, well, you know, we've got to suspend you for a couple of days

[01:00:38.380 --> 01:00:39.660]
because they're upset about this.

[01:00:40.020 --> 01:00:42.960]
And the boat will sit down and we'll make, ah, you're sticking up your ass.

[01:00:43.060 --> 01:00:46.540]
And I can't repeat all of the language and all of the comments and the characterization.

[01:00:47.140 --> 01:00:49.180]
But it was not a pretty sight or sound.

[01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:50.920]
And that's it.

[01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:57.720]
And so I can sit here and tell it very directly in the accurately, at least from where I'm sitting.

[01:00:57.720 --> 01:01:00.360]
And there's a segment out there that I could penetrate.

[01:01:00.680 --> 01:01:01.660]
It's just like the rush thing.

[01:01:01.860 --> 01:01:02.220]
It's the same thing.

[01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:04.020]
And believe me, I'm not comparing for all the rush.

[01:01:04.340 --> 01:01:06.640]
But I'm just saying, it's the same kind of mentality.

[01:01:07.700 --> 01:01:11.060]
We like so and so and therefore, no matter what you tell us, it isn't going to make any difference.

[01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:12.660]
Because we all got screwed.

[01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:20.680]
5-670560, pound 560 on the AT&T.

[01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:22.940]
And I do want to say this, something that happened while you were away.

[01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:24.140]
Oh, thank God.

[01:01:24.140 --> 01:01:29.080]
Because I came back and I said, hey, for help, we must go to Jim Yeltsin.

[01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:29.860]
Right on.

[01:01:30.180 --> 01:01:32.100]
And so we got fixed it and here we fixed line one.

[01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:32.760]
Is working now?

[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:33.720]
Which you'll notice that.

[01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:35.020]
There ain't nobody on it right now.

[01:01:35.420 --> 01:01:36.520]
Or maybe there is somebody on it.

[01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:36.760]
Hello?

[01:01:38.420 --> 01:01:39.660]
I thought we fixed line one.

[01:01:39.900 --> 01:01:41.340]
Or maybe it's not.

[01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:42.600]
Maybe this is maybe not.

[01:01:42.660 --> 01:01:44.120]
No, no, no, no, we've been using it all week.

[01:01:44.580 --> 01:01:45.280]
Sure you have.

[01:01:45.420 --> 01:01:45.660]
Hello.

[01:01:45.860 --> 01:01:46.560]
Maybe you think you have.

[01:01:46.620 --> 01:01:47.100]
Line one.

[01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:49.280]
No, we haven't used it all week.

[01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:49.940]
I think you're the line one.

[01:01:49.940 --> 01:01:50.960]
Oh, it just died again.

[01:01:51.660 --> 01:01:52.120]
You see?

[01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:54.720]
And you want to know why?

[01:01:54.900 --> 01:01:55.440]
Because you're here.

[01:01:55.900 --> 01:01:57.040]
Because George is here.

[01:01:57.300 --> 01:01:58.100]
How do you like that?

[01:01:58.120 --> 01:01:59.280]
It's been working all week.

[01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:00.260]
He fixed it on Monday.

[01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:03.280]
And he also fixed the office phone too.

[01:02:03.300 --> 01:02:03.900]
Yeah, for how long?

[01:02:04.460 --> 01:02:04.800]
About a minute.

[01:02:06.060 --> 01:02:07.840]
It's 11 past 10 at 5.

[01:02:07.940 --> 01:02:09.400]
60 or I didn't tell you about Frat Richie.

[01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:10.500]
We had a great time in Pomfano.

[01:02:10.620 --> 01:02:11.020]
But now we didn't.

[01:02:11.100 --> 01:02:11.740]
We had a terrible time.

[01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:14.020]
I thought it wasn't exciting there because it always is.

[01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:16.880]
But it was just a, hey, Wally Ross Jr.

[01:02:17.100 --> 01:02:17.960]
What got into you, sweetheart?

[01:02:18.060 --> 01:02:18.800]
Wally Ross Jr.

[01:02:18.980 --> 01:02:22.100]
had three winners including two gigantic long shots the other night at Pomfano.

[01:02:22.100 --> 01:02:26.660]
The 40th anniversary season of Great Harness Ration is underway at Pomfano Park right now.

[01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:28.080]
The racing tonight and four nights a week.

[01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:31.580]
Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday, first post time, 705.

[01:02:31.940 --> 01:02:34.880]
For top-class nighttime harness racing and high stakes poker too,

[01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:38.160]
the poker room is open noon to midnight every live racing day.

[01:02:38.860 --> 01:02:40.300]
Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday.

[01:02:40.660 --> 01:02:43.000]
And Pomfano Park is also open every afternoon evening,

[01:02:43.140 --> 01:02:45.220]
seven days a night a week for the best in simulcasting.

[01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:48.320]
You got your harness through a bright highlight action from all across North America

[01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:50.400]
that you can watch and plunge your guts on.

[01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:51.880]
The dining room in the top of the park.

[01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:53.200]
Oh, by the way, let me tell you about a dessert.

[01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:54.040]
Oops.

[01:02:54.320 --> 01:02:55.240]
Oh, they have a great note.

[01:02:55.320 --> 01:02:55.680]
Oh, seriously.

[01:02:57.840 --> 01:02:58.400]
Cheesecake, wantons.

[01:02:59.100 --> 01:03:00.060]
With strawberry sauce.

[01:03:00.820 --> 01:03:02.800]
When you hold the poker, oh, park in the dining room and you have that,

[01:03:02.860 --> 01:03:04.620]
you will think that you'd, and they heated up the heat.

[01:03:04.620 --> 01:03:05.360]
That's how it's heated up.

[01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:05.680]
Like heated, you want to.

[01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:07.120]
Whoo! What a combination.

[01:03:07.460 --> 01:03:09.540]
The food at the top of the park on the sixth floor is great.

[01:03:09.900 --> 01:03:12.480]
Don't forget, general parking and admission always free at Pomfano Park,

[01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:15.060]
especially when you park way out in No Man's Land because you're waiting for

[01:03:15.060 --> 01:03:16.800]
a fair rich to show up with your pass, which you didn't.

[01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:19.640]
New this season is a 20% increase in purses.

[01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:22.660]
A nightly giveaway of a $400 betting voucher and a revamped free

[01:03:22.660 --> 01:03:25.780]
power player rewards program that gives you points either for betting the horses

[01:03:25.780 --> 01:03:29.060]
or playing poker that you can redeem for special gifts in betting vouchers.

[01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:32.640]
Every Wednesday at Pomfano Park is dollar night, dollar draft beers, hot dogs, sodas,

[01:03:32.760 --> 01:03:33.540]
and lots more.

[01:03:33.860 --> 01:03:36.840]
Pomfano Park, go there tonight, post time, $705, and plunge your guts out

[01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:43.140]
for the new racing schedule called 954-972-2000 or on our web, Pomfano Park.com.

[01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:46.240]
Pomfano Park, a block south Atlantic Boulevard on Power Line Road.

[01:03:46.740 --> 01:04:02.360]
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my

[01:04:32.340 --> 01:04:35.020]
Harry Potter Harry

[01:04:35.020 --> 01:04:39.040]
And here my kids are light light

[01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:42.840]
They said we're so loud

[01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:47.320]
The first printing is so loud

[01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:51.300]
The first printing is so loud

[01:04:51.300 --> 01:04:54.020]
And the next thing is to bring

[01:04:54.020 --> 01:04:58.160]
I've spent six hours in the dark night

[01:05:01.500 --> 01:05:05.480]
Harry Potter Harry Potter

[01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:07.580]
I'm just weak

[01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:10.480]
Delicious neighbor of fact

[01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:11.920]
K-Pain

[01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:13.440]
K-Pain from Bell

[01:05:15.380 --> 01:05:21.400]
Harry Harry Harry Potter

[01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:21.940]
Harry Harry Harry Potter

[01:05:21.940 --> 01:05:24.020]
Harry Harry

[01:05:24.020 --> 01:05:27.340]
11.16 to 5.60 here's a fact from Frank and Melborn who said

[01:05:27.340 --> 01:05:27.520]
The last time I was in the dark night

[01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:28.620]
I was just blinded by the right

[01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:29.560]
Unbelieveable

[01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:30.980]
They sent the religious right conservative

[01:05:30.980 --> 01:05:32.220]
Idiots want to negate the election

[01:05:32.220 --> 01:05:32.720]
Bill Clinton

[01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:35.000]
Now the same bunch is rapidly defending W

[01:05:35.540 --> 01:05:36.920]
Thanks for putting the book on your side

[01:05:36.920 --> 01:05:38.340]
I wouldn't have bothered to read it otherwise

[01:05:38.340 --> 01:05:40.000]
And by the way, Ms. Fudge

[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:41.860]
David Brock Handeball is to come out of the closet

[01:05:41.860 --> 01:05:43.560]
And finally admit and fess up

[01:05:43.560 --> 01:05:44.200]
What are you doing?

[01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:44.820]
Gonna do it?

[01:05:44.900 --> 01:05:45.080]
No

[01:05:45.080 --> 01:05:45.740]
Fony

[01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:46.880]
Screamer

[01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:49.960]
I think the wheels are starting to come off the Iraq occupation

[01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:50.540]
Says Frank

[01:05:50.540 --> 01:05:55.360]
The CIA just leaked the memo about the Iraqi starting to conclude that we can be driven up by a guerrilla war

[01:05:55.360 --> 01:05:58.740]
I think this shows the CIA is turning on a bush administration for outing

[01:05:58.740 --> 01:06:02.280]
Plame and Chinese brow beating the analyst about the WMD intelligence

[01:06:02.980 --> 01:06:06.140]
It's weird to think that the CIA may be trying to help rid the country of this regime

[01:06:06.140 --> 01:06:07.880]
But I'll accept help from any source he says

[01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:10.520]
The media seems to be finding some backbone last night

[01:06:10.520 --> 01:06:12.920]
Ted Coppel went after Cheney even posed the question

[01:06:12.920 --> 01:06:16.140]
Is Cheney a strong VP and bushed just a figurehead?

[01:06:16.140 --> 01:06:16.980]
How do you like that?

[01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:17.640]
Absolutely

[01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:19.020]
Thank you, Frank and Mel Boren

[01:06:19.020 --> 01:06:19.820]
There's a little bit of hope

[01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:22.420]
And like you said, if the Democrats would find some backbone

[01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:24.460]
Well, they're busy filibustering right now in the Senate

[01:06:24.460 --> 01:06:25.840]
That's good, that's some backbone

[01:06:26.840 --> 01:06:27.160]
Handball

[01:06:27.160 --> 01:06:28.640]
Keep all them right-wing judges out of there

[01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:30.880]
And we did it not only we do it by 1130

[01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:32.340]
We did it way before 1130

[01:06:32.340 --> 01:06:34.760]
Which you can't even believe it, can't believe your eyes

[01:06:35.540 --> 01:06:37.560]
310 votes and it's only 1117

[01:06:38.540 --> 01:06:40.320]
What's your take on a firing of Scott Ferell?

[01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:41.900]
Greg Reid's an asshole 1116

[01:06:42.380 --> 01:06:44.220]
I don't care, never listen to him 43

[01:06:44.220 --> 01:06:45.900]
No great loss 31

[01:06:45.900 --> 01:06:47.760]
The radio business blows 30

[01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:49.580]
I'm pissed, I love Ferell 29

[01:06:50.220 --> 01:06:52.040]
He ended coming, he was over the top 27

[01:06:52.040 --> 01:06:53.720]
His voice nearly killed me 17

[01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:57.000]
I hated him any way 12 and Neil is much more vulgar 5

[01:06:57.940 --> 01:06:59.640]
Although Scott was much more entertaining

[01:07:00.460 --> 01:07:01.780]
Well that's what that other guy said

[01:07:01.780 --> 01:07:03.180]
He said I'm just bitching about the corner

[01:07:03.180 --> 01:07:04.120]
He didn't get your show

[01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:05.140]
He didn't understand it

[01:07:05.140 --> 01:07:06.280]
But he has been listening for a while

[01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:07.980]
And he did hear it once in a past day

[01:07:07.980 --> 01:07:08.560]
I don't know

[01:07:08.560 --> 01:07:10.780]
He listens every single day

[01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:16.000]
560.560 on the AT&T and Verizon line

[01:07:16.880 --> 01:07:17.800]
Plantation, hello

[01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:19.040]
Bush and 2000

[01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:20.620]
Yeah okay, Bush and 2000

[01:07:20.620 --> 01:07:22.200]
Alright, good for you, Pellet

[01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:23.620]
See you on the back of the truck

[01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:26.680]
Here's a call from North Miami Beach, hello

[01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:28.020]
How you doing?

[01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:28.440]
Okay

[01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:30.740]
I'm beautiful, Florida

[01:07:30.740 --> 01:07:33.160]
Don't unpack, man, don't do it

[01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:34.480]
Ever since I got here

[01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:35.640]
Oh

[01:07:35.640 --> 01:07:36.440]
Yeah

[01:07:36.900 --> 01:07:39.180]
Ever since I got here I've been listening to you guys

[01:07:39.180 --> 01:07:41.780]
And Ferell tells me what's up every night

[01:07:41.780 --> 01:07:43.560]
And I've been going to the Pansley's game

[01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:44.320]
Scarlett

[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:47.720]
Sheila Braun James the other night

[01:07:47.720 --> 01:07:49.760]
And I've been listening to you guys today

[01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:51.720]
And you guys are going to say what's up

[01:07:51.720 --> 01:07:52.920]
Or where they're going this time

[01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:56.860]
So is there another station I can listen to and get

[01:07:56.860 --> 01:07:57.900]
You know what's happening

[01:07:57.900 --> 01:07:59.080]
Yeah, 880.50

[01:07:59.080 --> 01:07:59.900]
They'll tell you where to go

[01:07:59.900 --> 01:08:01.680]
In fact, if you wait long enough I'll tell you where to go

[01:08:03.640 --> 01:08:06.300]
He would tell them what's up and where to go in this town

[01:08:06.300 --> 01:08:07.100]
Are you ready for that?

[01:08:07.460 --> 01:08:08.100]
Hey Pellet

[01:08:08.100 --> 01:08:08.260]
Go to hell

[01:08:08.260 --> 01:08:09.300]
Yeah, say it again

[01:08:09.300 --> 01:08:09.720]
Go to hell

[01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:13.480]
560.560

[01:08:13.480 --> 01:08:14.600]
Pellet 560

[01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:16.660]
Thank you for serving it up so nicely sir

[01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:18.380]
Fastball right down the middle

[01:08:19.400 --> 01:08:20.040]
560.7

[01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:21.240]
Now, did you fart in there or what?

[01:08:21.400 --> 01:08:21.860]
No, not me

[01:08:21.860 --> 01:08:23.940]
Well, something I didn't do the egg fart in here yet

[01:08:23.940 --> 01:08:24.880]
But I will trust me

[01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:25.860]
Maybe they're gassing you

[01:08:26.220 --> 01:08:27.140]
Do we have a match?

[01:08:27.860 --> 01:08:29.140]
Your breath would have up close for it

[01:08:29.140 --> 01:08:31.360]
So I can light my incest in here

[01:08:31.960 --> 01:08:34.580]
Here's the facts from Henry or says I'm not sure if you've seen this already or not

[01:08:34.580 --> 01:08:37.740]
But it's an article I was sent to me from the November 5th edition of the Business Week online

[01:08:39.180 --> 01:08:42.420]
Discusses bushes, bushes, post-war blunders despite the Harvard MBA degree

[01:08:43.300 --> 01:08:44.780]
Hope you enjoyed it if you haven't seen it

[01:08:44.780 --> 01:08:45.860]
Oh, it's a whole article

[01:08:45.860 --> 01:08:46.620]
Thank you, Henry

[01:08:47.500 --> 01:08:48.700]
PSC says don't retire

[01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:50.120]
What?

[01:08:50.340 --> 01:08:51.120]
Oh yeah, I like that thing

[01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:51.560]
Would you please?

[01:08:52.060 --> 01:08:52.560]
Light it and the

[01:08:54.060 --> 01:08:55.240]
Oh, it's several pages

[01:08:55.240 --> 01:08:56.200]
Oh, how many more pages?

[01:08:56.200 --> 01:08:58.360]
Oh, that's the end of it. Thank you. Thank you, Henry. Have a nice life

[01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:00.720]
5.670560

[01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:04.520]
This is your chance to really tell it like it is and look at that phone, man. Pretty weak

[01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:07.640]
Pretty weak. Your chance to really let it all hang out

[01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:09.440]
We will sit here and listen right till 2 o'clock

[01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:12.640]
Unless you just want to call into the old suck ass routine

[01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:14.640]
Oh, see, there he goes again ripping the callers

[01:09:16.300 --> 01:09:17.340]
Here's Dear Field. Hello

[01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:20.640]
Dear Field Beach

[01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:21.260]
Hello

[01:09:21.260 --> 01:09:21.960]
Yes, sir

[01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:24.540]
Hey, I have a couple of questions

[01:09:24.540 --> 01:09:26.760]
Maybe it'll clear it up for me. Let's clear the air

[01:09:26.760 --> 01:09:30.720]
Let's clear the air. Was he getting a lot of complaints?

[01:09:31.960 --> 01:09:32.460]
For real?

[01:09:33.060 --> 01:09:33.420]
Yes

[01:09:33.420 --> 01:09:35.440]
From the callers and from the sponsors

[01:09:35.440 --> 01:09:37.700]
The callers, forget about the callers

[01:09:37.700 --> 01:09:39.900]
The callers have nothing to do with whether we're on ear or not

[01:09:39.900 --> 01:09:41.920]
Callers are, see there I go again with the callers

[01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:42.460]
Uh-huh

[01:09:42.460 --> 01:09:45.680]
Yeah, the sponsors were a batelin out of the show some of them

[01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:51.760]
And there was a lot of stuff going on behind the scenes that he was, you know, they were working 20 hours at 8 to try to salvage it

[01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:52.040]
Right

[01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:53.820]
And he just couldn't understand that

[01:09:54.920 --> 01:09:55.280]
Evidently

[01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:59.060]
Because he wasn't breaking any FTC rules or anything like that, right?

[01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:00.500]
Uh, no, that's not right

[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:01.780]
Wow, he was

[01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:07.840]
From what they tell me, I mean, I didn't hear all of his show every day, but from what I'm hearing he was way over the edge a lot of times

[01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:14.980]
I'm just trying to understand his mentality, was it like a artistic control type situation or, you know, I don't understand it

[01:10:14.980 --> 01:10:20.760]
No, it's called being, uh, who wouldn't have liked that? George was just gonna be good, and I think that sums it up very well

[01:10:20.760 --> 01:10:24.540]
Uh, either he just doesn't get it or he's just such a hard ass and gets it to Massive Ego

[01:10:24.540 --> 01:10:26.600]
It's like he's right in a whole rest nature

[01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:29.000]
The whole rest of the world is out of step is what he thinks

[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.120]
I don't know, I never encountered anybody like him

[01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:33.040]
Well, you need that self-preservation

[01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:39.240]
Right, right, in other words, if you go to work in the morning and your boss is if you come in here wearing purple shoes again tomorrow

[01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:42.740]
I'm gonna fire your ass and you'll show up the next day and you got purple shoes on

[01:10:42.740 --> 01:10:46.200]
That means you don't, I mean, how important is it to wear purple shoes, right?

[01:10:46.680 --> 01:10:50.020]
Some people just don't have that self-preservation thing in them

[01:10:50.020 --> 01:10:52.460]
And those people keep getting canned over and over again

[01:10:52.460 --> 01:10:55.600]
That's why I'm trying desperately to explain to the audience, but they don't get it

[01:10:55.600 --> 01:10:56.780]
Well, he wasn't entertaining

[01:10:56.780 --> 01:10:58.580]
He wasn't no question, absolutely

[01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:03.020]
Whatever your boss says, you gotta do, and that's it

[01:11:03.020 --> 01:11:03.800]
Absolutely

[01:11:04.340 --> 01:11:05.420]
Have a great day, Palli

[01:11:05.420 --> 01:11:08.680]
Well said, now see, that guy was, you know, he understands it

[01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:11.960]
See, there's a difference between saying you liked him and he was entertaining

[01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:17.300]
Which I would say yes to both of those very much so, and on the other hand, he put himself in an untenable position

[01:11:17.700 --> 01:11:18.060]
Period

[01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:23.860]
And even when people hear who in positions of power would say, hey, let me help you with this

[01:11:23.860 --> 01:11:25.280]
Let me see if we can salvage this

[01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:28.040]
Hey screw you up, I'm gonna touch you ass, you're gonna see when you're in court

[01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:32.160]
Yeah, you can't do that, you can't just run over the whole rest of the world

[01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:34.860]
Like you're a giant mouth of a steamroller

[01:11:35.220 --> 01:11:36.100]
Alienating your ally

[01:11:36.100 --> 01:11:38.580]
In fact, I think that's a good analogy, a steamroller with a mouth

[01:11:39.780 --> 01:11:40.500]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:11:40.500 --> 01:11:40.800]
Yeah

[01:11:41.620 --> 01:11:42.680]
You can't do it

[01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:46.420]
Otherwise, this thing keeps happening to you repeatedly, you're gonna believe me

[01:11:46.420 --> 01:11:49.660]
I know a little bit about this business, I've been in about 100 years

[01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:52.180]
Otherwise, you keep getting fired

[01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:55.620]
And no matter how entertaining you, see I could be a hell of a lot more entertaining

[01:11:55.620 --> 01:11:59.840]
To go back to that guy I called before, if I could just say air, and believe me, I support that

[01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:01.180]
But that's not the way it is

[01:12:01.180 --> 01:12:01.540]
Right

[01:12:02.700 --> 01:12:06.220]
I support being able to say every word that's ever been invented on a year

[01:12:06.220 --> 01:12:07.440]
There's no excuse for you

[01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:11.360]
No way that the FCC has, it wasn't created for that

[01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:16.180]
The FCC was created to make sure that stations weren't interfering with each other technically on a radio dial

[01:12:16.180 --> 01:12:17.900]
That's the only reason it existed

[01:12:20.180 --> 01:12:22.620]
The FCC act of 34 whatever it whole was

[01:12:22.620 --> 01:12:27.340]
And then all of a sudden a bunch of assholes like Jesse Homs and some other right wingers over the years that evolved into this thing

[01:12:27.340 --> 01:12:30.580]
Oh, well, we're gonna be the word police and the excuse always is

[01:12:30.580 --> 01:12:32.500]
Well, we have to protect the children

[01:12:32.500 --> 01:12:35.460]
As if the children haven't heard every word that's ever been invented

[01:12:35.460 --> 01:12:38.260]
And some that we adults don't even know what they mean at this point

[01:12:38.260 --> 01:12:39.100]
Who do you think's inventing them?

[01:12:39.240 --> 01:12:39.980]
Right, that's right

[01:12:41.420 --> 01:12:44.020]
So if it's up to me, he could say whatever he wants

[01:12:44.020 --> 01:12:45.420]
And all of us would be a hell of a lot

[01:12:45.420 --> 01:12:49.160]
That's why I'm thinking that thing with the XM radio or whatever it is, satellite radio

[01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:50.400]
That's the way to go

[01:12:50.840 --> 01:12:53.580]
Get off the broadcast airwaves and then go on the satellite thing

[01:12:53.580 --> 01:12:57.100]
Which is not regulated by the FCC and see a bunch of assholes who do...

[01:12:57.100 --> 01:13:00.040]
I mean, you even listen to what they just make it up as they go along

[01:13:00.040 --> 01:13:04.800]
First we had the George Carl and Seven Words back in the 70s or was the WBAI thing

[01:13:05.780 --> 01:13:07.800]
And then they've expanded it from there

[01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:13.200]
And when that thing came down in 87 I guess it was about sexual activity or...

[01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:16.380]
Excautory... no, sexual organs or extracurricular activity

[01:13:16.940 --> 01:13:18.140]
But based on what?

[01:13:18.460 --> 01:13:19.180]
What does that mean?

[01:13:19.700 --> 01:13:20.840]
Yeah, based on what?

[01:13:21.160 --> 01:13:27.160]
So in other words sexual activity and the extracurricular organs and activity are things that aren't part of life

[01:13:27.160 --> 01:13:30.320]
In other words, I guess the people at the FCC Michael Powell never farted

[01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:30.780]
Okay?

[01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:31.920]
Never took a crap

[01:13:32.700 --> 01:13:33.540]
He's a smoothie

[01:13:33.540 --> 01:13:34.120]
Is it?

[01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:34.960]
You know, it's smoothie?

[01:13:35.140 --> 01:13:36.360]
Maybe he eats some banana smoothies

[01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:37.600]
Or maybe he just eats the old banana

[01:13:39.020 --> 01:13:39.860]
Who the hell knows?

[01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:43.700]
But I mean, I've been trying to explain that for years and years all

[01:13:43.700 --> 01:13:45.200]
You're just over the top man

[01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:47.160]
You're just too liberal and too right or not

[01:13:47.160 --> 01:13:48.020]
That's just the way it is

[01:13:48.540 --> 01:13:50.400]
There's no such thing as a little bit of freedom of speech

[01:13:51.800 --> 01:13:54.020]
And when it's a pain court when they ruled about, you know,

[01:13:54.220 --> 01:13:55.640]
Fire yelling, firing, a crowded theater

[01:13:55.640 --> 01:13:58.700]
Okay, we can understand that because that speech that endangers somebody else

[01:13:58.700 --> 01:14:02.180]
Okay, if you put somebody else in danger, you can't excuse that kind of speech

[01:14:02.180 --> 01:14:04.480]
Or if you slander somebody else, you can't excuse that

[01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:06.960]
But sure to that there should be no restrictions on speech

[01:14:07.540 --> 01:14:11.580]
In public, radio, TV, shortwave, pub-tent, internet, anywhere

[01:14:11.580 --> 01:14:13.460]
You should be able to say whatever the F you want

[01:14:13.980 --> 01:14:15.360]
See, there's a good example

[01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:15.820]
Mm-hmm

[01:14:16.300 --> 01:14:19.760]
We got to play little games, we got to use initials, we got to, you know, that whole deal

[01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:24.440]
It's wrong, it's bull crap, and the problem with the majority of the American public is

[01:14:24.440 --> 01:14:26.240]
That they've been conditioned to accept that

[01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:29.500]
It's bull crap, I heard some woman call up by the mad dog yesterday

[01:14:29.500 --> 01:14:31.400]
Well, I had, of course, some old bag, you know

[01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:37.500]
Oh, I'm glad for Elle is off because my little children, my children, you know, I had them in the backseat of the car

[01:14:37.500 --> 01:14:41.300]
Go driving them to school in the morning, and I don't want them to have to hear that language and that's a-

[01:14:41.300 --> 01:14:42.880]
But you know what, then turn another station on

[01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:48.020]
And for an additional which, if you got little kids on there, why the hell do you want them listening to a sports show in the first place, bitch?

[01:14:48.220 --> 01:14:49.000]
Right, writing their brain

[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:52.520]
Right, but that sports garbage put on a music stage, put on Y100

[01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:53.720]
Y

[01:14:54.260 --> 01:14:55.760]
Or put on WLRN

[01:14:55.760 --> 01:14:56.420]
There you go

[01:14:56.420 --> 01:14:59.920]
Well, no, but whatever, put on something they might want to listen to, put on some rock music

[01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:01.560]
Who's with here?

[01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:04.520]
Put on, well, you know, a kid they don't care, put on power

[01:15:05.120 --> 01:15:08.700]
Put on the party radio, a party in your pants, and stop listening to it

[01:15:08.700 --> 01:15:11.200]
It's like the dog barking at the moon thing again

[01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:12.740]
Trying to make it go away

[01:15:12.740 --> 01:15:15.200]
If you don't like it, there's eight minute other choices lady, okay?

[01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:17.200]
And that really frosted my ass too

[01:15:18.820 --> 01:15:20.340]
Here's Jim, who faxes and says

[01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:24.600]
I sure like to have been at Scott where I'll stand up gig of Uncle Funny's on Wednesday night

[01:15:26.020 --> 01:15:29.200]
Oh, I don't think that took place, do you?

[01:15:29.860 --> 01:15:30.520]
I don't know

[01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:32.480]
I think there might have been a postponement

[01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:33.020]
Absolutely

[01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:35.420]
My life and law

[01:15:35.420 --> 01:15:37.840]
This is sports radio by city

[01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:41.600]
New way, New way, and...

[01:15:41.600 --> 01:15:42.820]
An embarrassment

[01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:52.500]
A dupton rosy got more and more

[01:15:53.580 --> 01:15:55.740]
One or two more

[01:15:55.740 --> 01:15:58.500]
You'll be just like your hero

[01:15:58.500 --> 01:15:59.960]
Be a barrel

[01:16:02.160 --> 01:16:04.240]
Oh, now we know

[01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:09.000]
The only thing in your belly is Ray Bay

[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.520]
All these kids make us real mad

[01:16:12.460 --> 01:16:17.280]
Cause there is something with you that can't be had

[01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:19.300]
It's called a dad

[01:16:20.780 --> 01:16:22.980]
Your children can't win

[01:16:22.980 --> 01:16:27.840]
You don't have a need for a man when you're a lesbian

[01:16:31.500 --> 01:16:35.200]
Oh, there's a new rosy child

[01:16:35.200 --> 01:16:39.060]
She's got a way to keep them company

[01:16:39.060 --> 01:16:42.780]
You will be waiting a while

[01:16:42.780 --> 01:16:46.340]
A dupton rosy or a barren woman

[01:16:46.340 --> 01:16:50.160]
You better hope that your show keeps going

[01:16:50.160 --> 01:16:54.980]
Cause when it's done girl we want all the kids to bat

[01:16:57.940 --> 01:17:00.920]
Give them back, give them back

[01:17:00.920 --> 01:17:03.280]
Give them back their babies

[01:17:04.980 --> 01:17:09.860]
Let's be in the room rosy but hot, really lovely looking lesbians are in today

[01:17:09.860 --> 01:17:12.140]
Not big fat bull bikes like you

[01:17:12.140 --> 01:17:13.600]
That's what you can understand

[01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:15.820]
She heard that bikes were in and they said no, not you

[01:17:16.700 --> 01:17:19.340]
29 till noon at 560 WQM

[01:17:19.340 --> 01:17:22.420]
I better get the story about Uncle Funny's where they'll hang up

[01:17:22.420 --> 01:17:23.820]
Here's a poppin'o, hello

[01:17:24.700 --> 01:17:25.940]
Yes sir, how you doing?

[01:17:25.960 --> 01:17:28.020]
I was at Uncle Funny's on Wednesday

[01:17:28.020 --> 01:17:29.880]
And the girl in the front there

[01:17:29.880 --> 01:17:32.860]
You know the one that we're paying everything for

[01:17:32.860 --> 01:17:34.020]
I love his I never been there

[01:17:34.020 --> 01:17:39.480]
Well, she told us that due to contractual disagreements with QAM and Uncle Funny's for

[01:17:39.480 --> 01:17:42.060]
Well, wasn't going to be performing they let us in for free

[01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:44.860]
We had to buy the two drinks you know they have a two drink minimum

[01:17:44.860 --> 01:17:45.200]
Right

[01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:46.600]
But they let us in for free

[01:17:46.600 --> 01:17:49.560]
Now during the performance they were telling us that Farrell was fired

[01:17:49.560 --> 01:17:51.860]
But I thought that was all a joke you know I didn't think that was real

[01:17:51.860 --> 01:17:52.300]
Really?

[01:17:52.620 --> 01:17:54.240]
But that's what they told us

[01:17:54.820 --> 01:17:55.180]
Absolutely

[01:17:56.860 --> 01:17:58.500]
So he was he was an O-show

[01:17:58.500 --> 01:17:59.600]
He was an O-show

[01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:00.880]
Okay thanks for the report Pally

[01:18:00.880 --> 01:18:01.440]
Alright buddy

[01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:02.700]
Okay, don't make them a stick again

[01:18:02.700 --> 01:18:04.420]
So here's an interesting facts

[01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:08.560]
From Chris who says this morning on the highly weighted Mr. Ego

[01:18:08.560 --> 01:18:10.680]
Christian slash due radio show

[01:18:10.680 --> 01:18:14.140]
He thanked his very dear friend Jack Thompson for a job well done

[01:18:14.140 --> 01:18:17.660]
I'm getting the very rude and filthy talking Scott Farrell off the R&W QAM

[01:18:17.660 --> 01:18:20.420]
Mr. Ego went on to say that have Neil removed from the air

[01:18:20.420 --> 01:18:23.600]
Would be a great achievement for improving community standards in South Florida

[01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:24.300]
Says Chris

[01:18:24.300 --> 01:18:25.280]
Well Mr. Ego

[01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:26.640]
That's for you okay

[01:18:26.640 --> 01:18:28.420]
And by the way what station is that again?

[01:18:28.880 --> 01:18:29.320]
Hahaha

[01:18:30.360 --> 01:18:32.460]
What state does anybody know the call it is?

[01:18:32.480 --> 01:18:33.660]
Does it have call it?

[01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:33.820]
No

[01:18:33.820 --> 01:18:34.880]
Does it have any audience?

[01:18:35.020 --> 01:18:35.140]
No

[01:18:35.140 --> 01:18:36.080]
Does it have any numbers?

[01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:36.600]
No

[01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:38.700]
No, but they have 80 million spots, a dollar of holler

[01:18:40.320 --> 01:18:43.160]
For Steve's hair and Steve's penis and Steve's hearing aid

[01:18:43.160 --> 01:18:47.820]
And Steve's implants and Steve's nipple rings and whatever else he's got

[01:18:47.820 --> 01:18:48.440]
And breast and pussy

[01:18:48.440 --> 01:18:51.520]
And Steve's crucifix and Steve's adoption clinic and all these other things

[01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:52.320]
All of these things

[01:18:53.500 --> 01:18:55.860]
Boy, talk about insane jealousy okay?

[01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:57.640]
Man talk about a guy just going wild

[01:18:58.620 --> 01:19:02.300]
5,6,7,0,5,60 pound 5,60 on the AT&T

[01:19:02.300 --> 01:19:02.740]
You know what I mean?

[01:19:02.800 --> 01:19:03.200]
Absolutely

[01:19:03.200 --> 01:19:05.040]
On the AT&T Verizon line

[01:19:06.380 --> 01:19:07.800]
Here's the West Palm Beach hello

[01:19:08.520 --> 01:19:09.160]
Hi Neil

[01:19:09.160 --> 01:19:09.840]
Yes sir

[01:19:10.660 --> 01:19:16.140]
Man hey can Scott go on the air like right now or does he have no contract here?

[01:19:16.680 --> 01:19:19.920]
Well you know he said that he's when one of his shows he said

[01:19:19.920 --> 01:19:21.740]
People are asking me to go up against Neil

[01:19:21.740 --> 01:19:22.360]
Right

[01:19:23.060 --> 01:19:25.020]
So I mean I would listen to you but

[01:19:25.020 --> 01:19:28.380]
You know something they put Phil Henry with those tapes on against me

[01:19:28.380 --> 01:19:29.920]
I think they can put what they got rush on

[01:19:29.920 --> 01:19:31.320]
I don't really care I do my own show

[01:19:31.320 --> 01:19:33.620]
Hey let me tell you something else

[01:19:33.620 --> 01:19:36.320]
See that wouldn't surprise me because that ego thing that he's got

[01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:39.260]
He really believes that he's going to kick my ass and show me

[01:19:39.260 --> 01:19:41.640]
He's another one of these people who's obsessed with me

[01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:43.400]
I don't know why because I wasn't a competition

[01:19:43.400 --> 01:19:44.440]
Whether I was promoting him

[01:19:44.440 --> 01:19:46.320]
You're the big dog

[01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:48.740]
You're the big dog

[01:19:48.740 --> 01:19:51.000]
You're the big enchilada, the fat old Jew right?

[01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:55.640]
You know you say Anna

[01:19:56.200 --> 01:19:59.120]
This is just a sake of conversation

[01:20:00.760 --> 01:20:05.500]
You're not allowed to say the words and stuff you can't speak freely

[01:20:06.080 --> 01:20:11.380]
That's your whole gig is you know you say package

[01:20:11.380 --> 01:20:13.160]
And we know oh we're hip

[01:20:13.160 --> 01:20:14.160]
No I don't say package

[01:20:14.160 --> 01:20:16.560]
You got me confused with him I don't say package

[01:20:16.560 --> 01:20:17.560]
That's his package

[01:20:17.560 --> 01:20:19.420]
How about that side of it?

[01:20:19.460 --> 01:20:21.080]
Rax and big package yeah right?

[01:20:21.200 --> 01:20:24.320]
Yeah you know and we're hip so we get it you know

[01:20:25.420 --> 01:20:30.380]
Yeah but wouldn't it be a hell of a lot funnier if we didn't have to hint around if we could just say the damn words

[01:20:30.380 --> 01:20:31.680]
That's your whole gig though

[01:20:31.680 --> 01:20:33.180]
No that's not the whole gig you know

[01:20:33.180 --> 01:20:36.200]
That was the whole gig I'd be out the digging ditches right now

[01:20:36.200 --> 01:20:37.320]
No you're doing it great

[01:20:37.320 --> 01:20:38.840]
I'd be standing at the soup kitchen

[01:20:38.840 --> 01:20:41.760]
And the Osborns you know the Osborns right?

[01:20:41.900 --> 01:20:43.140]
How does the F word all the time?

[01:20:43.880 --> 01:20:47.880]
I read in the paper I don't have the CD that you could buy the CD of his whole show

[01:20:47.880 --> 01:20:51.680]
And they said you can listen to it with or without the bleeps

[01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:51.900]
Right

[01:20:51.900 --> 01:20:58.740]
And at least the person who wrote about it in the paper said that without the bleeps it wasn't as funny because you just hear him say the F word

[01:20:58.740 --> 01:20:59.700]
Well bleep them

[01:21:00.100 --> 01:21:01.480]
Have a great day palying

[01:21:01.480 --> 01:21:02.560]
Okay see ya

[01:21:02.560 --> 01:21:06.600]
blind one ain't working anymore I just thought I mentioned in case fix it's in the building because he did fix it

[01:21:06.600 --> 01:21:09.560]
And it was lit up there and all of a sudden it just died because George came back today

[01:21:09.560 --> 01:21:11.140]
By the way George is here so Ripman asked

[01:21:11.640 --> 01:21:13.340]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 16

[01:21:13.340 --> 01:21:14.940]
Well how they enjoy ripping you in there?

[01:21:14.960 --> 01:21:17.920]
You better adopt the same attitude I got now screw it you know what I'm saying?

[01:21:18.040 --> 01:21:19.580]
Oh screw it trust me

[01:21:19.580 --> 01:21:26.280]
Everybody out there is an expert and in this town they all got a problem all you do is bitch about the colors it's all I've ever heard and this one so much more

[01:21:26.280 --> 01:21:36.360]
You know something great put him on from 10 to 2 on 940 on 850 whatever for a few weeks until you know Jack starts with him again it ain't gonna last okay I don't care who they put on

[01:21:36.360 --> 01:21:40.360]
I'm here doing the best I can every day that's all muttling along that's right

[01:21:40.360 --> 01:21:47.900]
I just muttling along here in the middle of this abesely outfitting the checks right to the bank enjoying myself Toronto Amsterdam Miami where the hell I happen to be

[01:21:47.900 --> 01:21:54.220]
Mostly any place but Miami and the life is wonderful in fact Hank and I were commiserating yesterday about that

[01:21:54.760 --> 01:21:59.900]
About the fact that life is as good as it gets if we weren't so fat but that's beside the point more fat

[01:22:01.140 --> 01:22:04.860]
All more than others yeah some and I see there you go again why do you do that?

[01:22:05.180 --> 01:22:13.960]
That's what I do because you're a prick right no wonder they hate you well see I like Hank I like Hank a lot that's why I don't want him to die

[01:22:14.380 --> 01:22:25.140]
Yeah I was a little bit dismayed I was very happy to see him he's a great guy really seriously one of my favorite people one of the nicest guys ever worked with and especially and there was that period when we first came here I'll say it again

[01:22:25.140 --> 01:22:33.180]
But I couldn't understand why he was so psychotic then I worked here a few months and I understood and then I said to him and a mad dog I said just take the money in the back

[01:22:33.180 --> 01:22:39.320]
Screw it they're never gonna change and just go with the flow and look how much greater we're doing right now if we could just not be so fat

[01:22:39.900 --> 01:22:48.880]
What what's this happened to the audio here did you hear that just happened all by itself do you hear it no oh I sure didn't hear all week long I've been battling these speakers the

[01:22:48.880 --> 01:22:56.720]
Oh over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again maybe a creeper's on the pot with clearance

[01:22:57.940 --> 01:23:02.040]
Sitting on each other's lap taking turns here's Pembroke Pines hello

[01:23:03.380 --> 01:23:10.660]
Yes is that panthers no panthers one is the guy with a clicker yeah the ball three beats more free pizza

[01:23:14.520 --> 01:23:24.200]
Panthers didn't look so good last night Roberto Lohan go down he did let it in a couple of really greasy goals but he keeps him in the game if it weren't for him in the first period they'd been down like six nothing anyway

[01:23:24.920 --> 01:23:31.920]
So they just I don't know that one game was great I enjoyed it that for nothing white wash over Tampa Bay well we went to the other night but you know

[01:23:31.920 --> 01:23:38.680]
Rick Dudley this one to keep changing coaches that's not the job they need more talent they need more scores on it to stevey wise by the way nice goal and a great

[01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:43.360]
Kid that kids gonna be hell of a player just make sure we keep him okay keep him don't let him go away

[01:23:43.860 --> 01:23:51.380]
Pay him whatever he wants when he becomes a star which he will my commiserations to you panther fans because I have a feeling that the coaching change

[01:23:51.380 --> 01:24:01.920]
ain't gonna change too much because the coaches don't play the game here's Miami hello you yes sir what are you doing hey don't bitch that lady on the

[01:24:01.920 --> 01:24:08.220]
mad dog show yesterday which one you know I don't want her little kids in the backseat yeah that's like you know me and my wife get that on in the

[01:24:08.220 --> 01:24:13.380]
room watching a porn or flick Mikey comes knocking on the door and yeah come right on in son watch the you know the porn or flick here

[01:24:13.380 --> 01:24:21.100]
with us right for the money shot right he might enjoy it yeah but yeah I mean is for is there any chance for my come back or not

[01:24:21.100 --> 01:24:27.880]
to this station or any station what or hill hill show up somewhere I think he ain't coming back to this station I guarantee you that

[01:24:27.880 --> 01:24:33.100]
and what we're talking about about him being a competitor with you I mean you think you do that you think you want to compete against you I

[01:24:33.100 --> 01:24:40.340]
think he wants to yeah that's not cool huh that's not cool why not it's I have no problem with that doesn't bother me

[01:24:41.180 --> 01:24:46.580]
but you guys are like buddies and stuff no we're not buddies I mean on the year we were I barely even know the guy just saw him in

[01:24:46.580 --> 01:24:52.480]
here every once in a while and then you know I never saw him outside the building okay all right now we're okay have a right there

[01:24:55.440 --> 01:25:01.600]
oh here's the fact that says from Mike I don't know if you heard Mo this morning or I did not I didn't hear him and I didn't see him I didn't smell

[01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:08.020]
him I heard a little bit right there at the end see I get in the car when I'm here about 10 to late oh man I'm as I smart you know

[01:25:08.020 --> 01:25:14.580]
I don't come in like real early anymore anymore because that way I don't encounter it I did see guilty in the hallway that

[01:25:14.580 --> 01:25:21.200]
that we are we bonded but he's okay he's all right he's all right not great he's just fine

[01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:32.160]
haha now seriously if I had to give you an honest answer do you like yoli I like him he's all right he's unfortunately I don't know he's in a bad spot

[01:25:32.160 --> 01:25:38.540]
yeah I know that I'm not going to repeat anything he said Steve I'm not repeating what you said to me this morning because like I said I like

[01:25:38.540 --> 01:25:46.640]
you're a good guy and you're in a tough spot but I all week long so I don't get to hear Mo because I heard that when Joe Rose

[01:25:46.640 --> 01:25:53.660]
went in there oh a little story did you hear about this no I told you oh I did hear about it anyway Joe Rose came in

[01:25:53.660 --> 01:25:59.780]
and Joe had jotted down like I used to sometimes do although don't do it no Mo like a few things to talk about you

[01:25:59.780 --> 01:26:04.480]
know the dolphin game and I'm working and he had like a littlest and he put the paint down on the

[01:26:04.480 --> 01:26:09.800]
counter there in there while Mo was still on the air saying his goodbyes and then Joe walked out there and so

[01:26:09.800 --> 01:26:14.440]
during a commercial break the beast tells me Mo looked over and saw the list and one of them up the

[01:26:14.440 --> 01:26:19.840]
fourth thing on the list was for Joe to talk about Howard's hair piece Howard from Boca right Howard's hair

[01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:24.440]
piece and of course Mo I guess didn't take it too well absolutely didn't like it so there was like a little

[01:26:24.440 --> 01:26:29.520]
chill in the ears what I was describing the atmosphere during a crossover when Joe Rose came in and Mo

[01:26:29.520 --> 01:26:34.680]
shuffled out I do mean shuffle it says I don't know if you're in Mo this morning it's incredible how he's after

[01:26:34.680 --> 01:26:40.700]
your job around 615 him and Gildey came out of a break just after Neil Rogers promo was played Howard asked

[01:26:40.700 --> 01:26:46.280]
Goldie why was Scott fired Goldie said for crossing line I suppose Howard said I want to know what

[01:26:46.280 --> 01:26:50.840]
difference there is with what we just heard the promo Howard said there is a hypocrisy of QA

[01:26:50.840 --> 01:26:55.840]
minutes ridiculous I believe Howard said your promo something to do with rape although I'm not sure I just missed the promo

[01:26:55.840 --> 01:27:00.860]
the promo had one of those Wilk Chamberlain rape me cuts or something like that right yo yo yo let's

[01:27:00.860 --> 01:27:05.820]
rate Mo it said rape yeah but the interesting part is he's the one that was saying it gang rape is funny yeah

[01:27:06.600 --> 01:27:10.580]
oh did I say that I don't think so I think Howard said gang rape is funny depending

[01:27:11.180 --> 01:27:17.980]
huh depending on who's receiving well when he's when he's receiving it's always gang rape is funny

[01:27:23.480 --> 01:27:32.020]
a panic oh yeah yeah you two work of the uh have a good day of paradise okay

[01:32:56.900 --> 01:33:00.460]
you know has a lot of good stuff to say but his voice oh man it was bad my

[01:33:00.460 --> 01:33:04.220]
I turned it on the morning when I was taking my kids to school he was he is hard

[01:33:04.220 --> 01:33:07.160]
to listen to yeah and it was like my kids what's wrong with that guy he's got a bad

[01:33:07.160 --> 01:33:11.500]
cold I don't know I don't know if he's faking it or what you know yeah it was

[01:33:11.500 --> 01:33:15.480]
terrible but anyways Neil love your show then listen to you to forever I

[01:33:15.480 --> 01:33:19.420]

[01:33:49.180 --> 01:33:54.640]
high-strung you know high-strung yeah you know it's just a high-end

the sports section but wouldn't you think that jica's column should be on the

entertainment pages where the radio and TV is supposed to be no it's on a sports

[01:35:04.300 --> 01:35:08.120]

a rock he said in the middle just shaking his face that some boys who were

[01:39:26.840 --> 01:39:32.720]
down by the crick their feet in the water their hands on their marbles and

[01:39:32.720 --> 01:39:38.500]
play things and at half past four there came a young lady she looked like a

[01:39:38.500 --> 01:39:44.280]
pretty young creature she sat on the grass she pulled up her dress and she

[01:39:44.280 --> 01:39:50.200]
showed them her ruffles and laces and white fluffy dark she said she was

[01:39:50.200 --> 01:39:56.140]
learning a new way to bring up her children so they would not spin while the

[01:39:56.140 --> 01:40:02.060]
boys in the barnyard were shoveling rep you send later from yesterday's

hunt while the girl in the meadow was rubbing her eyes at the fellow down by

[01:40:08.420 --> 01:40:14.880]
the dark he looked like a man with a size of a home in the country with a big

[01:40:14.880 --> 01:40:20.860]
fence out front if he asked her for lightly she'd show him her little betdog

[01:40:20.860 --> 01:40:27.580]
who was subject to fits and maybe she let him grab hold of her small tender hands

[01:40:27.580 --> 01:40:33.960]
with a movement so quick and then she'd bend over and suck out his candy so

[01:40:33.960 --> 01:40:40.360]
tasty made a butter Scotch and then he spread with cream all over her cookies

[01:40:40.360 --> 01:40:46.000]

[01:42:04.600 --> 01:42:07.440]
probably George throughout the sheet that I had when I left yesterday I had

[01:42:07.440 --> 01:42:10.800]
the number on it how much we had I didn't touch anything in this it was a little

over 40 grand but somebody Schmitt can't it I touched nothing 5 6 7 0 5 60 how's

[01:42:15.060 --> 01:42:18.500]
that pull coming a lot of votes baby I mean it's incredible heavy heavy duty

[01:42:19.760 --> 01:42:24.660]
453 votes and really what it boils down to again there's only one person I'm

[01:42:24.660 --> 01:42:28.200]
gonna blame for all of this mess we went through again it is not Jack Thompson it

[01:42:28.200 --> 01:42:33.780]
is not the Scott Farrell it's a Greg read which by the way he's still leading the

[01:42:33.780 --> 01:42:38.080]
pack on a poll so even the audience knows it pack in the poll he's packing it

[01:42:39.340 --> 01:42:42.800]
because the bottom line is why do you why do you put somebody on who does a

[01:42:42.800 --> 01:42:47.100]
certain thing who's what will you know what you're getting that's it and then

[01:42:47.100 --> 01:42:50.340]
you're gonna like try to oh well gonna harness that energy and I'm gonna like

[01:42:50.340 --> 01:42:54.040]
do this I'm gonna do that and it all is a result of the fact that he broke

[01:42:54.040 --> 01:42:57.120]
the morning show make no mistake about it that's why he was so sheepish yesterday

[01:42:57.120 --> 01:43:00.200]
I've been here all week how many times do you think he actually came in here

[01:43:00.200 --> 01:43:05.120]
like said hi he stuck it after I talked about on the air a dozen times he

[01:43:05.120 --> 01:43:08.660]
stuck his head in the door yesterday and I was talking about this whole business

[01:43:08.660 --> 01:43:12.940]
and like you know that nervous sheepers look he gets and he's all

[01:43:12.940 --> 01:43:15.860]
congratulations on the great ratings again and like flew out of there you know

[01:43:15.860 --> 01:43:21.140]
because he knows I'm on to him he's not fooling me doesn't matter that he

[01:43:21.140 --> 01:43:26.460]
created a nightmare and we've had a succession from the Ron Hershey highway days

[01:43:26.460 --> 01:43:32.560]
I mean the morning road killed crew Jeff D. Foam the Seminole Indian disaster crew

[01:43:32.560 --> 01:43:36.020]
I mean you know it's just and then of course Mo and let me say one thing about

[01:43:36.020 --> 01:43:39.700]
that facts about Mo from a little bit ago see that bears out what I've said

[01:43:39.700 --> 01:43:42.860]
before he's not just happy with Dancin on Farrell's grave yesterday morning

[01:43:42.860 --> 01:43:46.040]
which he did for three solid hours with his audience with his phony baloney

[01:43:46.040 --> 01:43:50.620]
chronic's okay he's not just satisfied with that what he would love to see is

[01:43:50.620 --> 01:43:55.440]
everybody else get fired so that would be like job security for him hey that's

[01:43:55.440 --> 01:43:59.440]
how paranoid he is no it really paranoid is when it doesn't exist that's how

[01:43:59.440 --> 01:44:03.820]
nervous he is and rightfully so because everybody in the building hates you like

[01:44:03.820 --> 01:44:06.900]
poison mo you're right about not going to that goddamn rating party for the

[01:44:06.900 --> 01:44:09.480]
reason being that you have no friends in the building you know what you are Mo

[01:44:09.480 --> 01:44:13.160]
absolutely correct you have no friends in the building you know they got the

[01:44:13.160 --> 01:44:17.480]
what yeah look yeah I'm looking and we still can't find a piece and his dog ate

[01:44:17.480 --> 01:44:21.260]
his muskrat so he's walking around with a silly hat on all this week I'm told

[01:44:21.260 --> 01:44:26.800]
because of the fact he can't fight his muskrat the dog ate it five six seven oh five

[01:44:26.800 --> 01:44:32.280]
sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line what a place

[01:44:32.760 --> 01:44:36.220]

[01:45:02.720 --> 01:45:07.440]
like you just ran the yeah a little bit about the rest is talking about

[01:45:07.960 --> 01:45:12.360]

[01:48:30.880 --> 01:48:34.180]

[01:48:34.180 --> 01:48:34.740]
counter there

[01:48:34.740 --> 01:48:36.900]

[01:48:49.360 --> 01:48:52.440]

[01:48:52.440 --> 01:48:54.680]

little bit you have to be a rocket scientist because i'm sure not a little bit

[01:50:25.500 --> 01:50:28.720]
clever and like the guy said before and go to the age and like using certain

[01:50:28.720 --> 01:50:30.980]

so Greg reads is how much the need for your charity and i said

[01:54:49.700 --> 01:54:50.640]
long me fifty dollars

[01:54:50.640 --> 01:54:55.140]
cost seventeen at five sixty wq i'm here's the fact that says i agreed that it was

[01:54:55.140 --> 01:54:57.700]
uh... for all self-destructive nature that was firing however

[01:54:58.860 --> 01:55:02.260]
the real issues that the people like jackass tomson don't like what's on the

[01:55:02.260 --> 01:55:05.400]
radio they can listen to something else absolutely correct but of course you

[01:55:05.400 --> 01:55:09.180]
not dealing with the no nobody should be allowed where i can listen to uh

[01:55:10.040 --> 01:55:12.540]
nobody should be allowed to tell me what i can listen to is what they mean

[01:55:12.540 --> 01:55:15.900]
and if his ratings were a barometer a lot of people wanted listen to him

[01:55:15.900 --> 01:55:19.320]
Greg read is not the bad guy here perhaps for the first time it says and he just

[01:55:19.320 --> 01:55:20.700]
walked out of here would like to have heard this

[01:55:21.100 --> 01:55:24.680]
the bad guys are people like jackass tomson and fox news header it says thanks

[01:55:24.680 --> 01:55:26.140]
well there's no question about that but

[01:55:27.140 --> 01:55:30.700]
the fact is we put on a whirling out of control dervish and expect to be able to

[01:55:30.700 --> 01:55:34.120]
like kind of temperate you know i'm saying i think i don't with this temperance

[01:55:34.120 --> 01:55:37.040]
saying oh just calm down skipping oh gee it just bit me you know

[01:55:37.480 --> 01:55:42.600]
skip just weird up skipping oh speaking of skipping and he's the only one at

[01:55:42.600 --> 01:55:45.120]
self-department that came in here anywhere near me this week who hasn't given

[01:55:45.120 --> 01:55:48.300]
a dime to abandon pair rescue the good news is a week without Todd Dreck

[01:55:48.300 --> 01:55:52.000]
oh what a pleasure and a week without Bob Eisenberg

[01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:55.940]
oh what a pleasure Bob's a good guy no he's not

[01:55:56.520 --> 01:56:00.140]
why do you say that Bob Eisenberg what are you getting from him because you'd

[01:56:00.140 --> 01:56:03.360]
never would say that he tries he comes in here with copy periodically

[01:56:04.080 --> 01:56:07.100]
that piece of copy of mouth that's got the two bad mistakes in it you mean

[01:56:07.100 --> 01:56:10.260]
write that one yeah but at least then he he doesn't even prove

[01:56:10.260 --> 01:56:12.440]
free that he didn't even look at that's too much effort

[01:56:12.920 --> 01:56:16.300]
plus Todd Rex running a boiler room agency out of here just like we heard the

[01:56:16.300 --> 01:56:19.860]
day i found out about that from Jeff no yeah he's running a boiler room out

[01:56:19.860 --> 01:56:22.980]
of here he's got his own little agency like PD Lenny did that's why those spots

[01:56:22.980 --> 01:56:25.860]
I don't want to mention which ones they are have that crap copy on here that

[01:56:25.860 --> 01:56:30.420]
because he's he's doing it and they let it but the good news is i haven't

[01:56:30.420 --> 01:56:33.480]

thought this whole time i got a guy who lets his personality from day one how they've tried to do

[02:00:09.640 --> 02:00:14.040]
with change him and it's ridiculous he got the rating form and he was doing exactly what they

whether they hated him or loved him just like you do and he's doing his job and for some reason

[02:12:45.960 --> 02:12:49.720]
absolutely nothing that i said these last two days there wasn't right on the money

[02:12:50.540 --> 02:12:55.140]
i had my thumb right on it and then we'll take it from us how we tried on the inside to

[02:12:55.660 --> 02:13:00.560]
make it all good right and how i said here the the three days that i was here this week until

[02:13:00.560 --> 02:13:03.940]
the ball blew up and i'm sitting here to please don't do the you know don't say

[02:13:03.940 --> 02:13:08.900]
ah you say this all time it's it's always it always comes back to me which i don't do that i

[02:13:08.900 --> 02:13:12.400]
don't there you know but he's he's hallucinates certain things i believe

[02:13:13.660 --> 02:13:17.380]
he tried to explain the difference right more than one occasion how do you explain something

[02:13:17.380 --> 02:13:21.560]
as somebody who doesn't listen how do you have a convert it reminds me of my mother i was there

[02:13:21.560 --> 02:13:26.720]
in my mother's yesterday for lunch and after lunch i should just get up and walk out because

[02:13:26.720 --> 02:13:31.400]
and no matter what i say she's not listening anyway and at one point she started and i could see

[02:13:31.400 --> 02:13:36.660]
what i'm talking her the wheels are run very slowly in her old hand and then at that point oh i

[02:13:36.780 --> 02:13:41.060]
forgot what i was gonna say but but even though she did forget what she was gonna say to interrupt me

[02:13:41.060 --> 02:13:45.480]
she made it a point that no matter what i was saying she still didn't hear it you see what i'm saying

[02:13:45.480 --> 02:13:49.880]
so her the madness in her method still worked because she wasn't gonna pay any attention

[02:13:49.880 --> 02:13:53.840]
what i was gonna say and it was the same with him you cannot listen to somebody answering or

[02:13:53.840 --> 02:13:58.340]

really depressing maybe they can't have a wake the quiz i have not a influence in tv in america

[02:15:42.720 --> 02:15:46.760]
is fostered a complacent nation as a danger to democracy former vice president al Gore said

[02:15:46.760 --> 02:15:52.560]
Tuesday Gore speaking on media and democracy at middle tenisee state university told attendees

[02:15:52.560 --> 02:15:56.860]
that a client of newspapers as the country's dominant method of communication leaves average

[02:15:56.860 --> 02:16:01.580]
americans without an outlet for scholarly debate i guess he never heard this show when you say

[02:16:01.580 --> 02:16:06.940]
we have scholarly debate all the time every day intellectual every call our democracy is suffering

[02:16:06.940 --> 02:16:10.900]
in the age when the dominant medium is not accessible to the average person and doesn't lend itself

[02:16:10.900 --> 02:16:15.720]
most readily to the conveyance of complex ideas about self-governance score said instead it pushes

[02:16:15.720 --> 02:16:19.300]
toward a lowest common denominator only must have heard this show

[02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:23.880]
Gore said the results of that inaccessibility are reflected most prominently in the change

[02:16:23.880 --> 02:16:27.520]
priorities of the country's elected officials who will feel that debating important issues is

[02:16:27.520 --> 02:16:32.560]
relatively meaningless today how do they spend their time instead raising money to buy a 30 second

[02:16:32.560 --> 02:16:38.840]
tv commercials students and members of the community filled the 235 c. auditorium for Gore's

[02:16:38.840 --> 02:16:42.520]
appearance several hundred more walked to speech on a big screen monitor set up in the building's

[02:16:42.540 --> 02:16:47.240]
it was the first to two lectures students at 200 college campuses across the country also watch

[02:16:47.240 --> 02:16:51.120]
Gore speech by satellite and ask the former vice president questions by calling a tool for your number

[02:16:52.740 --> 02:16:57.000]
he said democracy in america flourish at the height of the newspaper era which empowered

[02:16:57.000 --> 02:17:01.060]
the one to influence the many that change with the advent and subsequently popularity of

[02:17:01.060 --> 02:17:05.320]
television to say no in the average american watches four hours of tv a day what does it do to

[02:17:05.320 --> 02:17:09.580]
us that has relevance to democracy does it encourage passivity it is connected to the obesity

[02:17:09.580 --> 02:17:13.800]
is it connected to the obesity academic if people are just staring at little box four hours

[02:17:13.800 --> 02:17:18.540]
a day and has a big impact on democracy said and there's nothing worse than staring at little

[02:17:18.540 --> 02:17:25.700]
box all day or big one that's what Peter North said Gore said a remedy to tv's dominance maybe

[02:17:25.700 --> 02:17:31.000]
the internet a print based man he's right he invented it he ought to know a print based meeting

[02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:35.820]
that's extremely accessible to the average person we have to choose to rehabilitate our democracy

[02:17:35.820 --> 02:17:39.660]
in part by making creative use of these new meeting by insisting within the current institution

[02:17:39.660 --> 02:17:43.400]
and i'm going to tell you right now whether without al Gore if you want the truth go to the internet

[02:17:43.900 --> 02:17:48.060]
and there's a lot of bullcrap under two and a lot of phony scam ads you got to know where to look

[02:30:37.580 --> 02:30:42.240]
call from normal camp that's excellent and you want to know why why you see because this is the

[02:30:42.240 --> 02:30:47.320]
kind of crap that goes on in this community and then the game has played this way i threaten you

[02:30:47.320 --> 02:30:52.160]
i intimidate you i make your life a hell and therefore i can do all kinds of shanigans behind the

[02:30:52.160 --> 02:30:56.320]
scenes and you're never going to write about me or talk about me or let the public know that it's

[02:30:56.320 --> 02:31:00.900]
me jack Thompson who's doing all of these things who's behind all of this crap then it can

[02:31:00.900 --> 02:31:04.720]
happen on this show jack i'm going to tell you why and if you're listening right now you have to

[02:31:04.720 --> 02:31:09.900]
get your toothbrush packed up because you're going to jail because years ago after you stole two

[02:31:09.900 --> 02:31:15.060]
years of my life with all the shanigans when it was my turn and we finally got to decide an agreement

[02:31:15.940 --> 02:31:20.220]
after two years of living hell and in that agreement you said you wouldn't listen to this program

[02:31:20.220 --> 02:31:24.380]
you wouldn't mention my name you wouldn't refer to me in any way shape or form then we had to get

[02:31:24.380 --> 02:31:29.340]
a permanent injunction against you harassing me and uh... and stalking that was before the stalking

[02:31:29.340 --> 02:31:34.300]
laws run a books so that you can't come within that figure what it was three hundred yards of my

[02:31:34.300 --> 02:31:40.820]
house of me of anything so i'm off limits for you jack and i'm not going to be intimidated like

[02:31:40.820 --> 02:31:43.940]
the rest of the people in the media in this town so you can pull all your hanky-panky behind the

[02:31:43.940 --> 02:31:49.680]
scenes and send thousands of psychotic emails to Greg Reid and Norm Kent and get help to get the

[02:31:49.680 --> 02:31:54.200]
for al fired off the air i think the audience has a right to know what it's all about

[02:31:54.660 --> 02:31:59.520]
and why the station had to spend ninety percent of their waking hours of fending this guy off

[02:31:59.520 --> 02:32:04.260]
because i know him better than anybody else i spent two years of living hell so you can

[02:32:04.260 --> 02:32:08.640]
say all the letters you might be and norms call for the benefit of the audience was oh uh please

[02:32:08.640 --> 02:32:12.100]
have me a lot mentioned me by name on a year well you're not supposed to be listening anyway the only

[02:32:12.100 --> 02:32:15.380]
way you know i'm mentioning your name and when by the way they're coming on faxes from the audience

[02:32:15.380 --> 02:32:18.580]
and then we're entitled to mention your name your public figure such as you are

[02:32:20.160 --> 02:32:26.640]
see i'm not scared so i'm going to sit here and let the audience know who it was and why it is

[02:32:26.640 --> 02:32:31.920]
and just like i said yesterday the idea that one person can dictate community standards in an area

[02:32:31.920 --> 02:32:38.080]
like this where we got four million people living is an outrage but this is the way the game is played

[02:32:38.080 --> 02:32:42.020]
oh well if you mentioned my name on a year i'm going to start saying no you're not not concerning

[02:32:42.020 --> 02:32:46.660]
me you're not or you're going to jail because you're in violation already of our agreement you're

[02:32:46.660 --> 02:32:51.480]
not supposed to even mention my name i don't exist as far as you're concerned

[02:32:54.720 --> 02:32:59.360]
jack five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on a t here's the fact that says i think

[02:32:59.360 --> 02:33:03.420]
Greg will be making a trip over to Naples next week to explain the morning fiasco first he bust

[02:33:03.420 --> 02:33:08.520]
up the first team then has radio boot camp in San Diego with a huge expense then bust the team up

[02:33:08.520 --> 02:33:13.200]
now here's a guy he likes and six months later he's gone sir you are absolutely correct sir

[02:33:13.200 --> 02:33:21.340]
well said but you see in light of the fact that Greg read new there where there was this individual

[02:33:21.340 --> 02:33:24.580]
out there in this community that's all the more reason he shouldn't have put for all on the first

[02:33:24.580 --> 02:33:29.200]
place remember those discussions we had sure of what is he thinking about doesn't he realize what's

[02:33:29.200 --> 02:33:36.160]
going to happen here five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on and the reason you won't

[02:33:36.160 --> 02:33:40.240]
read about it in the newspapers is because people like Tom jikkin he already had to go through hell

[02:33:41.500 --> 02:33:45.440]
and others and so they're all scared they're all scared to tell you the real story behind the

[02:33:45.440 --> 02:33:51.660]
story what's going on here i'm not one twenty what do we got one twenty one twenty twenty bucks out

wqa m nil yes sir how you doing today's regular sensational you know i knew there was a big problem

[02:36:55.440 --> 02:37:01.360]
in this country right when we uh went through our elections and we got bush elected if you look back

[02:37:01.360 --> 02:37:06.400]
and you remember seeing the tv screen on who got all the electoral votes and what areas were blue

[02:37:06.400 --> 02:37:11.740]
and what areas were red right if you notice what's what's what's where the main space that had red

[02:37:12.300 --> 02:37:18.220]
yahoo states you got it but yahoo's yes the nazi people well the red you know what the red

[02:37:18.220 --> 02:37:23.940]
you know what the red stands for don't you stands for red neck that's right exactly exactly and if you

[02:37:23.940 --> 02:37:29.260]
look all the blue were florida california new york new jersey michigan minnesota that's right

[02:37:29.260 --> 02:37:34.400]
Pennsylvania the whole of New England that the california you got it all around the edges we're

[02:37:34.400 --> 02:37:39.000]
living and breathing people live and in the middle of the deep soft it's all yahoo exactly all you

[02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:42.920]
had to do was look at the tv screen and it told you right there in your face who were we who we

[02:37:42.920 --> 02:37:45.840]
were dealing with of course it didn't tell you where they fixed the votes in florida but that's

[02:37:45.840 --> 02:37:49.420]
another story exactly isn't there is that comforting to know that now that we got these electronic

[02:37:49.420 --> 02:37:53.800]
voting machines it'll be so much easier for them to fix all the elections now exactly exactly they

[02:37:53.800 --> 02:37:57.240]
can have their technicians go in their play with them in fact you're saying i'm dye bolding

[02:37:57.240 --> 02:38:01.600]

doing neo man free speech and uh you know screw them uh republican thanks a lot pal i have a great day

[02:38:16.820 --> 02:38:20.220]
you too but yeah this idea that there are certain people that think they can pull all our shenanigans

[02:38:20.220 --> 02:38:23.860]
behind closed doors and i'm going to intimidate everybody and nobody's ever going to talk about me

[02:38:23.860 --> 02:38:27.300]
and nobody's going to know that i'm the one who's uh creating all this stirring behind the scenes

[02:38:27.300 --> 02:38:33.140]
bull crap that stops today that stops right now on his show okay that stops right this moment

[02:38:34.560 --> 02:38:38.340]
and shame on you people in the rest of the media in this tunnel are so easily intimidated i know

[02:38:38.340 --> 02:38:41.440]
this guy can make your life a living hell and although most of you don't have the kind of agreements

[02:38:41.440 --> 02:38:45.420]
that i've got where this guy can't even like breathe my name or think about me quit thinking about me

[02:38:45.420 --> 02:38:52.000]
jack he's thinking about it right now yeah oh yeah make no mistake about that that too it's got a new

[02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:57.900]
Roger's bubble head mmm can't imagine what he's doing with it bubble five six seven oh five sixty

[02:38:57.900 --> 02:39:06.340]
out pound five sixty on the AT&T and for us in wireless line shame on you Norma for being such a pussy

[02:39:06.340 --> 02:39:10.260]

down baby you got it right there you got the signature on the paper you got all the documents man

[02:39:20.660 --> 02:39:24.220]
wouldn't it be wonderful to dredge up all of that stuff again and lay it out there for the public

[02:39:24.220 --> 02:39:28.500]
so they understand the kind of a living hell that some of us have to go through because of one man

[02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:33.360]
because one guy who decided i'm going to decide what's going to be on the radio i'm the super

[02:39:33.360 --> 02:39:38.260]
moralist because the Lord told me so yeah right yeah and God told me you're full of crap

stuttering gill and homestead says i'm so happy to see your station is finally realizing that

[02:45:42.800 --> 02:45:46.680]
there are people in homestead i was able to meet McGill and see your station van on the corner

[02:45:47.160 --> 02:45:51.140]
304th in u.s. 1 would like to invite all a homestead to that location for a chance to win a gift

[02:45:58.840 --> 02:46:04.900]
they have good work stuttering gill and homestead i think he's stuttering on it so how much we got

[02:46:06.240 --> 02:46:10.960]
that 140 or something 120 we got something i bet you we do over 200 down there it's not too good

[02:46:10.960 --> 02:46:17.380]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on a AT&T in Verizon wireless line wqa m

[02:46:17.380 --> 02:46:22.220]
do we do over 200 down here sir all right there's my radio here real fast go ahead

[02:46:22.220 --> 02:46:27.240]
right um yeah just wanted to make a point about the about the song clarity especially

[02:46:27.240 --> 02:46:31.880]
you were talking in the in a 10 o'clock hour about the condolences song and the right now

[02:46:31.880 --> 02:46:35.400]
you know i think i think that people forget that it's not just the matter of playing

[02:46:35.400 --> 02:46:41.760]
you know joke songs to make fun of people i mean they can make fun of it it's satire it's to make

[02:46:41.760 --> 02:46:46.620]
a point exactly it's it's that's hard to make people think about what these people are doing

[02:46:46.620 --> 02:46:50.080]
that's not about the fact that they're you know they look funnier that they are that they act when

[02:46:50.080 --> 02:46:54.500]
you're top money it's it's what they're doing it's the make you think and they'll look a little

[02:46:54.500 --> 02:46:58.400]
bit deeper into some of the actions and it's the fact that for example kind of these the right

[02:46:58.400 --> 02:47:03.140]
to the as a qualified for her job you know that she really that she really it is nothing but a

[02:47:03.140 --> 02:47:08.460]
chevron shield that's correct exactly so i mean i mean if people should not get that out of shape

[02:47:08.460 --> 02:47:12.640]
about about the fact that you play or don't play and in fact i think that the censored version

[02:47:12.640 --> 02:47:16.440]
makes the point even stronger you know what i'm saying right anyway it's one of the exact point

[02:47:16.440 --> 02:47:22.300]
in the wish you a great a great weekend you two thanks thank you here's one that says George

[02:47:22.300 --> 02:47:25.800]

funny not to be on here it says besides rick is just an obnoxious but head suds was always the

[02:47:59.420 --> 02:48:06.940]
heart of that show in my opinion says giri amen giri oh no you see that he slipped he finally admitted

[02:48:06.940 --> 02:48:10.300]
he hated rick like poison no i'm just agreeing with giri you just got through saying you hated

[02:49:23.840 --> 02:49:29.440]
hypocritical where's that poppy i poppy the council tells us that it's okay to be tolerant but we

In bush Fatherland nation, fascist USA.

[02:57:39.360 --> 02:57:49.200]
You gotta hate those Jews, and sentence liberals to believe everything we can.

[02:57:50.640 --> 02:57:52.680]
And the state run new.

[02:57:54.760 --> 02:58:00.700]
Blood war and four gold red, feel up your escalade.

[02:58:02.140 --> 02:58:07.640]
A roof and tiny bush venue, fascist USA.

[02:58:09.680 --> 02:58:12.600]
We don't mind you see our jobs go,

[02:58:12.600 --> 02:58:15.500]
a bunch of enemies go,

[02:58:16.960 --> 02:58:20.420]
we're fascinated by a chain of

[02:58:20.420 --> 02:58:24.640]
don't need no stupid books.

[02:58:24.860 --> 02:58:30.900]
All's hour is racing, the tax of courage can win.

[02:58:33.060 --> 02:58:38.480]
Everybody's earning vases, like the US ain't.

[02:58:38.500 --> 02:58:40.760]
We're at their 10th day, we lost a lot of weight, isn't it?

[02:58:42.000 --> 02:58:43.580]
Oh, the Nazi end of his comment.

[02:58:45.980 --> 02:58:47.940]
26 before 2 at 5, 60 W.

[02:58:48.060 --> 02:58:49.160]
Didn't he look like he lost some weight?

[02:58:49.640 --> 02:58:50.040]
Absolutely.

[02:58:50.200 --> 02:58:51.140]
To me, like an answer to.

[02:58:52.740 --> 02:58:55.700]
Oh, the IOC, OK's, transsexual athletes in the Olympics.

[02:58:56.140 --> 02:58:56.840]
That's a relief.

[02:58:57.360 --> 02:59:01.820]
Athletes who have undergone sex change operations will be eligible to compete in the Olympics for the first time

[02:59:01.820 --> 02:59:03.760]
that our new rules being finalized by the I-

[02:59:03.760 --> 02:59:08.740]
see the international Olympic Committee convene meeting in Sweden of all play well.

[02:59:08.940 --> 02:59:13.520]
Why not there last month of medical experts in the field and will announce its policy in the next few weeks.

[02:59:13.700 --> 02:59:18.180]
We have no discrimination, IOC medical director Patrick Shamash told the AP yesterday.

[02:59:18.600 --> 02:59:22.180]
The IOC will respect human rights details are still being worked out.

[02:59:22.180 --> 02:59:28.400]
But Shamash said transsexual athletes will be eligible for the Olympics once they pass a certain amount of time after sex change surgery.

[02:59:28.960 --> 02:59:31.400]
Will the real men please stand up?

[02:59:33.560 --> 02:59:35.160]
And that what they say here usually in the morning?

[02:59:36.240 --> 02:59:36.940]
All the time.

[02:59:37.220 --> 02:59:39.540]
Most of our middle-level management people stay seated.

[02:59:40.200 --> 02:59:43.580]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T.

[02:59:44.060 --> 02:59:44.400]
Absolutely.

[02:59:44.800 --> 02:59:45.820]
And Verizon Wireless Line.

[02:59:45.940 --> 02:59:46.540]
We're doing screenless.

[02:59:47.180 --> 02:59:49.780]
705 votes by the way we did go 701 by 130.

[02:59:50.300 --> 02:59:50.780]
How do you like that?

[02:59:50.980 --> 02:59:51.320]
I knew it.

[02:59:51.980 --> 02:59:52.500]
No, you didn't.

[02:59:53.120 --> 02:59:56.080]
What's your take on the firing of Scott for well, that's our poll question today.

[02:59:56.340 --> 02:59:59.040]
And let me say it again, I'm glad that we were able to do the faxes and whatever.

[02:59:59.500 --> 03:00:00.960]
To paint a better picture of me.

[03:00:01.180 --> 03:00:08.280]
And I will say this because you can talk about the Greg Factor and how he screwed up the morning show and about how Ferels over the top which he is in out of control and yoddy-oddy.

[03:00:08.420 --> 03:00:14.740]
But it is true that we're not for the crount that herringing of one individual that none of this would have ever happened.

[03:00:15.320 --> 03:00:15.400]
Right.

[03:00:15.720 --> 03:00:18.400]
We'd still be rolling along, singing our song with a big box.

[03:00:18.540 --> 03:00:20.580]
People out there would be happy if they wanted to listen to it.

[03:00:20.660 --> 03:00:22.000]
If they wanted to and not they could.

[03:00:22.240 --> 03:00:23.340]
See, that's what it's all about.

[03:00:23.460 --> 03:00:24.900]
Jack, it's all about freedom of choice.

[03:00:25.260 --> 03:00:26.500]
Freedom of what you want to listen to.

[03:00:26.580 --> 03:00:27.800]
If you don't like it, don't listen to it.

[03:00:27.800 --> 03:00:29.980]
There's 80's in and other stations on there.

[03:00:30.240 --> 03:00:32.720]
Turn on Mr. Ego there and let him lick your cheeks, okay?

[03:00:35.020 --> 03:00:36.440]
Same old tired baloney.

[03:00:37.800 --> 03:00:39.900]
707 and a most amazing part of all of this.

[03:00:40.140 --> 03:00:41.540]
Scott Ferel ain't even a fag.

[03:00:41.920 --> 03:00:42.840]
That's pretty amazing, huh?

[03:00:44.380 --> 03:00:48.520]
I mean, I mean, first there, there's me and then there's Janorino who's allegedly a dyke in this and that.

[03:00:48.840 --> 03:00:49.580]
And I believe it.

[03:00:49.740 --> 03:00:53.160]
But nevertheless, oh, I'll tell you who at Luther Campbell, he's no fag.

[03:00:53.880 --> 03:00:54.920]
No, I saw those videos.

[03:00:54.920 --> 03:00:55.460]
Yeah.

[03:00:56.880 --> 03:00:59.260]
707 votes, what's your take on a firing in Scott Ferel?

[03:00:59.760 --> 03:01:01.000]
Greg Rees and Assel, 195.

[03:01:01.460 --> 03:01:02.760]
And by the way, Kim and he were admitted to that.

[03:01:02.980 --> 03:01:04.140]
He said, yes, I am an Assel.

[03:01:04.480 --> 03:01:04.880]
That's the wrong.

[03:01:04.940 --> 03:01:05.740]
I won't get to argument here.

[03:01:06.560 --> 03:01:07.000]
I'm pissed.

[03:01:07.160 --> 03:01:08.520]
I love Ferel, 157.

[03:01:09.220 --> 03:01:09.980]
I don't care.

[03:01:10.060 --> 03:01:10.680]
I never listen to him.

[03:01:10.760 --> 03:01:11.160]
101.

[03:01:11.580 --> 03:01:12.480]
No great law, 72.

[03:01:13.100 --> 03:01:14.760]
The radio business blows 53.

[03:01:15.100 --> 03:01:15.460]
It blows.

[03:01:16.120 --> 03:01:16.780]
He had a coming.

[03:01:16.780 --> 03:01:17.840]
He was over the top 50.

[03:01:18.480 --> 03:01:20.480]
His voice nearly killed me, 39.

[03:01:21.120 --> 03:01:22.480]
I hated him anyway, 30.

[03:01:23.880 --> 03:01:25.560]
How many people said I hated him anyway?

[03:01:25.580 --> 03:01:26.540]
About 30, man.

[03:01:26.660 --> 03:01:27.700]
And he was much more vulgar.

[03:01:27.920 --> 03:01:32.500]
10 out of 707 only 10, 1.4%.

[03:01:33.780 --> 03:01:35.880]
But that's like I said, I heard that a couple of times

[03:01:35.880 --> 03:01:37.920]
on a station from Colors, we're trying to let Draup Hitler.

[03:01:38.060 --> 03:01:40.720]
And then of course, also a mo this morning, who's looking again trying to throw

[03:01:40.720 --> 03:01:41.520]
a darts in my direction.

[03:01:41.860 --> 03:01:43.040]
Throw them all you want, mo, okay?

[03:01:43.680 --> 03:01:44.600]
Throw them all you want.

[03:01:44.900 --> 03:01:47.440]
Although I understand that you're the catcher in the family.

[03:01:49.500 --> 03:01:51.200]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[03:01:51.820 --> 03:01:55.520]
And of course, as they say at the deli, they call me old catcher on the rye.

[03:01:57.620 --> 03:01:58.300]
WDQ I am.

[03:01:58.880 --> 03:01:59.900]
Hey, yes sir.

[03:02:00.560 --> 03:02:03.320]
How can you get the Parish Hilton video on the internet?

[03:02:04.320 --> 03:02:05.140]
You know how to bring it up?

[03:02:05.320 --> 03:02:05.940]
The what video?

[03:02:06.640 --> 03:02:07.940]
Parish Hilton, a pornographic.

[03:02:07.960 --> 03:02:09.440]
You do a search like I did.

[03:02:10.520 --> 03:02:10.620]
Yeah.

[03:02:10.620 --> 03:02:15.560]
And look for places that have forums where people share files with other people as opposed to websites

[03:02:15.560 --> 03:02:17.180]
that want to offer it to you for money.

[03:02:17.720 --> 03:02:21.700]
Just put in Parish Hilton video or see Parish Hilton video.

[03:02:22.260 --> 03:02:25.560]
And it took me about a half hour of searching through different sites, but I found it.

[03:02:26.280 --> 03:02:26.560]
Okay.

[03:02:26.860 --> 03:02:27.120]
Okay.

[03:02:27.420 --> 03:02:28.240]
Have a good time.

[03:02:29.000 --> 03:02:29.960]
I don't even know what you're talking about.

[03:02:30.140 --> 03:02:31.020]
The Parish Hilton sucks video.

[03:02:31.340 --> 03:02:31.600]
I got it.

[03:02:31.680 --> 03:02:34.680]
My part of her having sex with Shannon Doherty's ex husband.

[03:02:34.800 --> 03:02:35.240]
Oh, who?

[03:02:35.620 --> 03:02:36.300]
Parish Hilton.

[03:02:36.900 --> 03:02:38.260]
I don't even know who that line is.

[03:02:38.420 --> 03:02:40.440]
She's the the millionaire social light.

[03:02:40.620 --> 03:02:41.140]
She's on the news.

[03:02:41.280 --> 03:02:41.980]
If you don't watch me.

[03:02:42.140 --> 03:02:43.600]
Oh, even from the Conrad Hilton, the crowd.

[03:02:43.740 --> 03:02:43.960]
Right.

[03:02:43.960 --> 03:02:46.000]
Oh, I haven't seen that story.

[03:02:46.200 --> 03:02:47.080]
Jesus, we're so off.

[03:02:47.640 --> 03:02:49.240]
I'll bog down with this other crap here.

[03:02:49.280 --> 03:02:50.940]
I'm missing all the important stuff going on in the world.

[03:02:51.920 --> 03:02:52.960]
I got to hear on my USB.

[03:02:53.800 --> 03:02:57.840]
You have the video on that little thing.

[03:02:58.200 --> 03:02:58.560]
I do.

[03:02:58.900 --> 03:03:00.000]
A lot of things on this little thing.

[03:03:00.040 --> 03:03:00.460]
Oh, my God.

[03:03:00.520 --> 03:03:02.540]
Georgia's got that Parish Hilton video on his little thing.

[03:03:02.620 --> 03:03:03.240]
I can't believe it.

[03:03:03.320 --> 03:03:03.920]
I'll put it away.

[03:03:05.900 --> 03:03:08.560]
5.670560, pound 5.60 on the AT&T.

[03:03:08.640 --> 03:03:10.000]
It Verizon wireless line.

[03:03:10.240 --> 03:03:11.920]
Boy, am I sure glad I came back here this week.

[03:03:11.940 --> 03:03:12.840]
Oh, man.

[03:03:12.840 --> 03:03:14.060]
Who needed this place?

[03:03:15.040 --> 03:03:15.900]
Anybody wonders?

[03:03:16.020 --> 03:03:17.700]
Well, how come the line's spending more time in South Florida?

[03:03:18.000 --> 03:03:20.260]
Well, this week is a real good example for you.

[03:03:21.760 --> 03:03:22.240]
WQIM.

[03:03:22.900 --> 03:03:23.380]
Yes.

[03:03:23.640 --> 03:03:23.940]
How you doing?

[03:03:24.080 --> 03:03:24.800]
I'm doing pretty good.

[03:03:25.180 --> 03:03:26.100]
This is for George.

[03:03:27.120 --> 03:03:27.120]

[03:03:27.540 --> 03:03:28.880]
I don't know my mama Bingo.

[03:03:29.260 --> 03:03:29.260]

[03:03:32.720 --> 03:03:33.500]
He wishes.

[03:03:35.720 --> 03:03:39.000]
Oh, I knew your Frank Lumber came out of hiding pretty sad club.

[03:03:39.380 --> 03:03:41.400]
Your Frank Lumber has been holding back, but they've coming out.

[03:03:43.300 --> 03:03:43.660]
WQIM.

[03:03:44.140 --> 03:03:44.760]
Hey, Neil.

[03:03:44.980 --> 03:03:45.420]
Yes, sir.

[03:03:45.660 --> 03:03:47.080]
Are you guys still down at home, Stan?

[03:03:47.500 --> 03:03:49.020]
Yeah, we're still down there till 2 o'clock.

[03:03:49.140 --> 03:03:50.420]
Hey, this is Georgia Gaki.

[03:03:50.580 --> 03:03:51.600]
Oh, we're all on them.

[03:03:55.680 --> 03:03:57.060]
See, the reason we didn't know he...

[03:03:57.060 --> 03:03:59.520]
We know it wasn't Joe's because he didn't say where it's supposed to be.

[03:03:59.580 --> 03:03:59.980]
Oh, my.

[03:04:00.600 --> 03:04:01.160]
Oh, my.

[03:04:01.480 --> 03:04:01.840]
Oh, my.

[03:04:02.320 --> 03:04:02.940]
Oh, my.

[03:04:03.300 --> 03:04:03.640]
Oh, my.

[03:04:04.120 --> 03:04:04.780]
Oh, my.

[03:04:05.120 --> 03:04:05.420]
Oh, my.

[03:04:05.900 --> 03:04:06.200]
Oh, my.

[03:04:06.200 --> 03:04:06.580]
Oh, my.

[03:04:06.580 --> 03:04:06.580]

[03:04:06.840 --> 03:04:06.840]

[03:04:07.180 --> 03:04:07.540]
WQIM.

[03:04:07.640 --> 03:04:07.780]
Hello.

[03:04:11.740 --> 03:04:12.380]
What was that?

[03:04:13.580 --> 03:04:14.040]
I met.

[03:04:14.320 --> 03:04:15.080]
I can't say anything.

[03:04:15.180 --> 03:04:16.940]
It was another one of your people, the way in the background.

[03:04:17.140 --> 03:04:17.860]
I can hear what they said.

[03:04:18.040 --> 03:04:18.520]
What are your people?

[03:04:18.740 --> 03:04:19.380]
No, not one of mine.

[03:04:19.580 --> 03:04:19.760]
Fag.

[03:04:20.380 --> 03:04:20.700]
WQIM.

[03:04:21.080 --> 03:04:21.500]
Hey, Neil.

[03:04:21.720 --> 03:04:22.060]
No, one of yours.

[03:04:22.220 --> 03:04:22.720]
They're all fags.

[03:04:22.820 --> 03:04:23.140]
Yes, sir.

[03:04:23.320 --> 03:04:23.680]
How you doing?

[03:04:23.840 --> 03:04:24.140]
Pretty good.

[03:04:24.760 --> 03:04:25.640]
I was curious.

[03:04:25.960 --> 03:04:31.680]
How long do you think it'll be before Rush blooms back up to 400 pounds out of the Eiffel Tower?

[03:04:31.720 --> 03:04:32.080]
About a week.

[03:04:32.180 --> 03:04:32.900]
Ain't off, nothing.

[03:04:33.420 --> 03:04:34.740]
You really believe he's off it?

[03:04:35.200 --> 03:04:35.360]
No.

[03:04:35.360 --> 03:04:40.060]
I mean, they say like one out of maybe 50,000 people actually succeed in those places.

[03:04:40.060 --> 03:04:44.580]
And especially you think in five weeks after he was taking like 30,000 pills a month or whatever

[03:04:44.580 --> 03:04:46.660]
now it was, you think he's really dried out?

[03:04:46.840 --> 03:04:48.060]
No, he's going to bloom back up.

[03:04:48.080 --> 03:04:51.660]
And I think it'll be a month before he's back on it and then apologize.

[03:04:52.300 --> 03:04:53.900]
Yeah, he'll be back, yeah, apologize.

[03:04:54.300 --> 03:04:55.900]
Maybe it'll go on for another 10, 20 years.

[03:04:56.180 --> 03:04:56.320]
Yeah.

[03:04:56.440 --> 03:05:01.920]
And do you think on Monday he's going to have the guts to take calls that aren't, you know, people just hit him.

[03:05:01.920 --> 03:05:05.260]
They're just going to screen him so heavily they probably like have armed guards.

[03:05:05.260 --> 03:05:06.300]
Not like they usually do.

[03:05:06.480 --> 03:05:07.940]
No, you have to screen him even more heavily.

[03:05:08.080 --> 03:05:10.560]
They probably have people with oozy standing at your door when you make a call.

[03:05:11.000 --> 03:05:11.760]
Good luck, you pal.

[03:05:11.940 --> 03:05:12.700]
All right, thank you.

[03:05:12.720 --> 03:05:14.000]
Diddo diddo.

[03:05:14.000 --> 03:05:18.380]
What the rosh returns on Monday and we don't mind promoting it cause who the hell gives a crap, you know.

[03:05:18.620 --> 03:05:24.680]
Those ditto heads, those idiots who want to buy his right wing bull crap, his right wing paranoid crap about out of clinton's, you know, they killed everybody.

[03:05:25.380 --> 03:05:27.140]
Didn't they also kill Jesus?

[03:05:27.280 --> 03:05:28.460]
I think that's what Mel Gibson's a.

[03:05:29.980 --> 03:05:30.280]
Oh, my.

[03:05:31.340 --> 03:05:33.300]
This is 20 or by six.

[03:05:33.880 --> 03:05:34.460]
You are.

[03:05:37.120 --> 03:05:41.840]
The voice of the Toronto Maple Leafs and you're listening to the hockey authority.

[03:05:42.040 --> 03:05:42.880]
Neil God.

[03:05:46.160 --> 03:05:46.880]
Oh.

[03:05:47.020 --> 03:05:48.600]
Has full.

[03:05:49.080 --> 03:05:50.800]
Has full.

[03:05:50.960 --> 03:05:54.720]
That way, my thing is such an asshole.

[03:05:54.720 --> 03:05:55.580]
All right.

[03:05:55.720 --> 03:06:05.380]
He yelled at Manage that greed turned because he wouldn't take a shower with Hank Olberg as whole.

[03:06:06.020 --> 03:06:07.640]
As whole.

[03:06:08.140 --> 03:06:11.720]
He's realizing a suction as whole.

[03:06:12.320 --> 03:06:15.560]
He's just like Hitler and Abe Abrong.

[03:06:16.000 --> 03:06:18.940]
What's that he's pounding on?

[03:06:39.240 --> 03:06:41.300]
Has full.

[03:06:41.980 --> 03:06:43.700]
Has full.

[03:06:44.040 --> 03:06:47.780]
He's looking for essential assholes.

[03:06:48.360 --> 03:06:54.820]
He only think there is love to save his property right away.

[03:06:58.740 --> 03:07:00.220]
It does, they might even count it.

[03:07:00.340 --> 03:07:02.160]
On your case, if you vote for a boy, they'll count it twice.

[03:07:02.840 --> 03:07:05.440]
Sixty to two mad dog help us out with an ice check for a band of hair.

[03:07:05.500 --> 03:07:06.460]
You said it's a good cause.

[03:07:06.460 --> 03:07:07.840]
You said the dolphins are going to the dogs.

[03:07:08.380 --> 03:07:09.180]
Is what he said.

[03:07:09.320 --> 03:07:10.180]
And I would agree with that.

[03:07:10.680 --> 03:07:12.080]
Obviously, I'm fancy got out of here.

[03:07:13.560 --> 03:07:14.980]
He likes that job, man.

[03:07:15.140 --> 03:07:15.960]
He loves that job.

[03:07:16.660 --> 03:07:18.660]
Listen, I'll see you in a couple of months, man dog.

[03:07:18.660 --> 03:07:19.140]
Nice seeing you.

[03:07:19.540 --> 03:07:20.200]
I'll be out of here.

[03:07:21.400 --> 03:07:22.280]
At any rate, good man.

[03:07:22.720 --> 03:07:23.840]
And he's just staying two to four.

[03:07:23.940 --> 03:07:25.380]
That's the boy you just got to write out of my mouth.

[03:07:25.600 --> 03:07:26.440]
Okay, he's staying two to four.

[03:07:26.740 --> 03:07:28.580]
So I think that means Joe Rose, don't you, eight to ten?

[03:07:28.760 --> 03:07:29.300]
Sounds good to me.

[03:07:29.440 --> 03:07:30.300]
Little dog and a big dog.

[03:07:30.660 --> 03:07:31.580]
And yours truly in between.

[03:07:31.580 --> 03:07:32.440]
And George, once in a while,

[03:07:32.580 --> 03:07:33.900]
did I hear from his big friends?

[03:07:34.780 --> 03:07:35.100]
Howdy, Gordon.

[03:07:35.580 --> 03:07:36.560]
Now, this is a good fact.

[03:07:36.740 --> 03:07:38.980]
See, they think that I disagree with this, but I think they got a good point.

[03:07:39.180 --> 03:07:43.080]
It says, I think that many of the senators who voted for their war resolution against their true feelings

[03:07:43.080 --> 03:07:45.420]
were in the same position as you were in, and they conned a Lisa matter.

[03:07:45.760 --> 03:07:49.240]
They would lose their jobs because Carl Rowe and the Bushies had the American people so convinced

[03:07:49.240 --> 03:07:51.720]
that a vote not to support them was a vote for Sodom.

[03:07:52.000 --> 03:07:54.980]
Look what happened to Max Cleelan and Paul Wellstone probably would have lost his job.

[03:07:55.320 --> 03:07:59.100]
So they caved in and chose to keep their jobs so they can do more in the Senate defeat other Bush programs

[03:07:59.100 --> 03:08:01.600]
as we need you to stay rather than go over playing that bit.

[03:08:02.480 --> 03:08:04.020]
It says, you may not think it's a fair comparison.

[03:08:04.120 --> 03:08:04.460]
No, you're wrong.

[03:08:04.520 --> 03:08:05.620]
I think it's an excellent comparison.

[03:08:05.900 --> 03:08:09.700]
But the right wingers are taking over our government and brainwashing the true patriotic flag waivers.

[03:08:09.880 --> 03:08:11.300]
So Congress can't speak out either.

[03:08:11.600 --> 03:08:12.820]
They would have appeared on patriotic.

[03:08:12.820 --> 03:08:14.040]
That's a very good point.

[03:08:15.300 --> 03:08:20.100]
But that's why I really give Hayamaarts to Howard Dean because he's the one guy who really had the balls in spite of all of that.

[03:08:20.500 --> 03:08:22.680]
Of course, he was no longer, you know, he was the member of Congress.

[03:08:22.860 --> 03:08:27.960]
He's a former Vermont governor, but nonetheless, Howard Dean had the big pair.

[03:08:30.140 --> 03:08:33.940]
56670560, pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line.

[03:08:35.100 --> 03:08:35.460]
WDQAM.

[03:08:36.120 --> 03:08:37.900]
Yeah, I have a question for you.

[03:08:38.160 --> 03:08:38.300]
Yes.

[03:08:39.600 --> 03:08:45.040]
The guy that just broke the 8500 skydives in 24 hours.

[03:08:45.980 --> 03:08:46.640]
What about him?

[03:08:46.800 --> 03:08:48.140]
Do you have any information on that?

[03:08:48.260 --> 03:08:48.400]
No.

[03:08:50.420 --> 03:08:52.640]
56670560, pound 560 on the AT&T.

[03:08:52.740 --> 03:08:53.220]
What a jerk.

[03:08:53.400 --> 03:08:53.780]
What an idiot.

[03:08:53.920 --> 03:08:54.460]
What an imbecile.

[03:08:54.560 --> 03:08:55.140]
See, we're back to that.

[03:08:55.240 --> 03:08:55.900]
We're going to call him again.

[03:08:56.000 --> 03:08:57.040]
Talking about the call has been idiots.

[03:08:57.900 --> 03:08:59.660]
Now, you know that guy who called earlier still listening.

[03:08:59.780 --> 03:09:02.420]
I would like him to analyze that last call and see what he would say.

[03:09:03.380 --> 03:09:03.700]
Right?

[03:09:04.140 --> 03:09:05.340]
You should have answered his question.

[03:09:06.020 --> 03:09:07.980]
No, I think we asked him what he thought the last call.

[03:09:08.300 --> 03:09:09.040]
He's an asshole.

[03:09:09.060 --> 03:09:09.380]
Right.

[03:09:09.660 --> 03:09:10.500]
That's what that guy would say.

[03:09:10.660 --> 03:09:11.940]
Make no mistake about it.

[03:09:12.740 --> 03:09:16.580]
If we had asked Mo, if the last guy to call was an asshole, he'd say absolutely.

[03:09:16.760 --> 03:09:18.780]
See, even he would agree a crusty old fart like Mo.

[03:09:19.680 --> 03:09:23.120]
So anyway, I think one of the reasons Mad Dog don't want to do 8 to 10 in the morning.

[03:09:23.140 --> 03:09:28.400]
He doesn't want to start his day out by seeing the Mo man every morning by taking a look at that nasty piece of crap.

[03:09:30.580 --> 03:09:31.660]
He didn't deny it.

[03:09:31.800 --> 03:09:33.360]
I said, you don't want to see Mo every morning doing.

[03:09:33.620 --> 03:09:34.440]
You come in here and see him no Mo.

[03:09:36.220 --> 03:09:37.620]
And you know what he said?

[03:09:37.740 --> 03:09:39.460]
No, no, no, no.

[03:09:39.460 --> 03:09:40.400]
That's what he said.

[03:09:42.000 --> 03:09:44.800]
Can you imagine starting out your day every morning taking a look at that?

[03:09:46.020 --> 03:09:48.100]
That nasty, miserable bastard?

[03:09:48.420 --> 03:09:49.420]
I'm gonna say something else.

[03:09:50.300 --> 03:09:51.300]
W-Q-I-M.

[03:09:52.960 --> 03:09:53.360]
Nailer.

[03:09:53.620 --> 03:09:54.300]
Yes sir, speaking.

[03:09:55.040 --> 03:09:56.000]
Hey, Naila good morning.

[03:09:56.320 --> 03:09:56.660]
Good evening.

[03:09:56.960 --> 03:09:57.180]
Good evening.

[03:09:57.440 --> 03:09:57.840]
Good evening.

[03:09:58.040 --> 03:09:58.040]

[03:09:58.060 --> 03:09:58.860]
Top of the evening to you.

[03:09:59.300 --> 03:10:00.940]
Listen, I got to just say one thing.

[03:10:01.000 --> 03:10:02.580]
I've been listening to you for a long time.

[03:10:02.580 --> 03:10:02.740]
Right.

[03:10:03.020 --> 03:10:07.140]
And I just cannot believe that this guy is still around harassing me.

[03:10:07.440 --> 03:10:11.740]
I think he tacked up in the head out to wherever he spots like that.

[03:10:12.000 --> 03:10:12.320]
Yeah.

[03:10:12.940 --> 03:10:19.220]
But it's just amazing that I mean, but she like 10, 15 years ago this guy was all over you.

[03:10:19.280 --> 03:10:23.460]
It's amazing that a brilliant mind like that has nothing better to do than listen to the radio.

[03:10:23.480 --> 03:10:24.880]
A brilliant mind like that?

[03:10:25.140 --> 03:10:27.300]
I guess he's listening to the radio.

[03:10:27.540 --> 03:10:29.040]
He's a lawyer and all this other stuff.

[03:10:29.040 --> 03:10:29.640]
Oh yeah.

[03:10:30.340 --> 03:10:34.820]
You would think he'd have some better to do than listen to the radio all day.

[03:10:35.460 --> 03:10:35.860]
You think.

[03:10:36.280 --> 03:10:36.840]
You think.

[03:10:37.040 --> 03:10:38.800]
Other than sitting around him is underwear at home, right?

[03:10:39.000 --> 03:10:40.120]
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, you and him.

[03:10:40.680 --> 03:10:41.480]
I'll speak to you later.

[03:10:41.780 --> 03:10:42.760]
Okay, have a great day pal.

[03:10:42.980 --> 03:10:45.060]
You think but some people ain't got no life.

[03:10:45.260 --> 03:10:45.820]
That's the problem.

[03:10:46.860 --> 03:10:52.120]
They have no life in fact, their entire existence is running around with some kind of fantastic vision

[03:10:52.120 --> 03:10:53.460]
of saving mankind from itself.

[03:10:53.520 --> 03:10:54.100]
I have no life.

[03:10:54.320 --> 03:10:55.620]
Another religious oh weko.

[03:10:58.040 --> 03:11:01.540]
56670560.560 on the AT&T and Verizon line WDQIM.

[03:11:01.880 --> 03:11:04.400]
$21.52.

[03:11:04.780 --> 03:11:05.420]
Okay, thank you.

[03:11:05.480 --> 03:11:06.000]
Here's the change.

[03:11:06.840 --> 03:11:08.380]
Is he feeling the change yet or what?

[03:11:08.860 --> 03:11:09.260]
WDQIM.

[03:11:10.560 --> 03:11:10.960]
Speaking.

[03:11:12.100 --> 03:11:12.700]
Hi, Neil.

[03:11:12.920 --> 03:11:13.240]
How are you?

[03:11:13.740 --> 03:11:14.360]
Fine, are you?

[03:11:14.580 --> 03:11:14.780]
Great.

[03:11:15.400 --> 03:11:17.960]
I can't believe the crow didn't get any books on your poll.

[03:11:18.220 --> 03:11:22.120]
Crow as the crow flies, he was, I don't know, I guess we should have probably put him on there, you know what?

[03:11:22.660 --> 03:11:23.440]
I'll talk to you later.

[03:11:23.440 --> 03:11:23.900]
Okay.

[03:11:24.020 --> 03:11:26.000]
I got your crow bodice right here, home boy.

[03:11:26.040 --> 03:11:28.800]
Yeah, he's, plus we didn't put him on there because he's on another station now.

[03:11:28.800 --> 03:11:33.060]
Any doing the mornings on that 940 with their 0.000, I'll take your work for it.

[03:11:33.060 --> 03:11:33.560]
I think he is.

[03:11:34.700 --> 03:11:35.940]
And I think what's his name?

[03:11:36.040 --> 03:11:39.040]
Clarence is still booking the guest on that morning show over there for his buddy and a wiener.

[03:11:40.200 --> 03:11:40.520]
WQIM.

[03:11:41.600 --> 03:11:44.800]
Would you like to compare you and Ferrell or if you're not afraid?

[03:11:45.640 --> 03:11:46.580]
If I'm not afraid.

[03:11:47.040 --> 03:11:48.540]
Yeah, but is that, is that, is that, you and Ferrell?

[03:11:48.720 --> 03:11:49.520]
Well, this sounds like Dennis.

[03:11:50.220 --> 03:11:50.660]
It is.

[03:11:50.760 --> 03:11:51.440]
It is.

[03:11:52.880 --> 03:11:53.680]
There you go.

[03:11:54.580 --> 03:11:55.340]
There you go.

[03:11:55.520 --> 03:11:56.920]
Wings all the wackos out of the woodwork.

[03:11:57.000 --> 03:11:58.460]
Crazy Dennis, the professional Catholic.

[03:11:59.460 --> 03:12:00.240]
What do I tell you?

[03:12:00.260 --> 03:12:00.800]
I haven't lost it.

[03:12:01.000 --> 03:12:02.000]
No, we don't talk to you.

[03:12:02.100 --> 03:12:02.560]
Okay, we don't talk.

[03:12:02.660 --> 03:12:04.500]
We talked a lot of assholes, but not in your category.

[03:12:04.500 --> 03:12:05.540]
We're in a separate category.

[03:12:06.000 --> 03:12:06.820]
They have their own show.

[03:12:06.880 --> 03:12:09.580]
We don't need your analysis of me and Ferrell or anybody else.

[03:12:09.760 --> 03:12:11.800]
I'm not going to sit here and take crap from an idiot like you.

[03:12:11.980 --> 03:12:12.460]
Okay, Schmuck.

[03:12:13.200 --> 03:12:14.880]
And by the way, you can go back into closet now.

[03:12:14.980 --> 03:12:15.080]
All right.

[03:12:15.220 --> 03:12:16.720]
They clear the skillens out for the weekend.

[03:12:17.340 --> 03:12:17.980]
Three to six.

[03:12:18.940 --> 03:12:19.260]
WQIM.

[03:12:20.480 --> 03:12:20.800]
QAM.

[03:12:20.920 --> 03:12:21.060]
Hello.

[03:12:22.180 --> 03:12:22.760]
Yes, Neil?

[03:12:22.900 --> 03:12:23.280]
Yes, sir.

[03:12:24.780 --> 03:12:25.120]
Hello.

[03:12:25.440 --> 03:12:26.140]
Yes, sir, speaking.

[03:12:27.340 --> 03:12:27.880]
Hey, Neil.

[03:12:28.180 --> 03:12:28.320]
Yes.

[03:12:28.800 --> 03:12:30.120]
What happened to Ferrell, man?

[03:12:30.560 --> 03:12:31.120]
Gone, baby.

[03:12:31.560 --> 03:12:31.900]
No, my.

[03:12:32.120 --> 03:12:33.420]
What happened to him, though?

[03:12:33.460 --> 03:12:34.940]
He was fired to did.

[03:12:35.500 --> 03:12:35.840]
Why?

[03:12:36.040 --> 03:12:38.620]
Because he was too dirty.

[03:12:38.980 --> 03:12:39.760]
Too dirty of a mouth?

[03:12:40.120 --> 03:12:40.740]
Too dirty.

[03:12:40.900 --> 03:12:41.440]
They're so dirty.

[03:12:43.360 --> 03:12:44.260]
All right, Neil.

[03:12:44.320 --> 03:12:44.780]
Thank you, man.

[03:12:44.940 --> 03:12:45.400]
Well, here he is.

[03:12:45.420 --> 03:12:46.720]
No, no, not on this station anyway.

[03:12:47.560 --> 03:12:49.920]
Because we got professional agitators running around.

[03:12:49.920 --> 03:12:50.880]
He's offensive.

[03:12:51.240 --> 03:12:54.800]
And like I said, just, you know, didn't have enough common sense to like lay low for a little

[03:12:54.800 --> 03:12:55.020]
while.

[03:12:55.020 --> 03:12:56.740]
The things, you know, just couldn't do it.

[03:12:56.880 --> 03:12:57.660]
Couldn't control himself.

[03:12:58.060 --> 03:12:59.980]
So there's plenty of blame to go all the way around.

[03:13:01.340 --> 03:13:03.680]
Although when George came in this morning, he says, I know who I blame.

[03:13:04.320 --> 03:13:05.320]
More than anybody else.

[03:13:05.540 --> 03:13:05.780]
Great.

[03:13:06.160 --> 03:13:06.320]
Yeah.

[03:13:06.640 --> 03:13:07.260]
That's what George said.

[03:13:09.320 --> 03:13:10.740]
Five, six, seven, oh five, 60.

[03:13:11.040 --> 03:13:11.760]
Pound five, 60.

[03:13:11.800 --> 03:13:12.300]
How much we got?

[03:13:12.560 --> 03:13:13.000]
Three, ten.

[03:13:13.280 --> 03:13:13.800]
Three, ten.

[03:13:13.940 --> 03:13:14.480]
Not too bad.

[03:13:14.840 --> 03:13:16.200]
We've got another appearance later, too.

[03:13:16.500 --> 03:13:18.320]
Down at home, Stab, which I better promote right now.

[03:13:18.320 --> 03:13:19.800]
I'm going to get all bent out of shape.

[03:13:20.980 --> 03:13:22.460]
Three hundred and ten bucks down there in Homestead.

[03:13:22.540 --> 03:13:29.160]
Now later on this afternoon, the QM panel, be at the Walmart Supercenter, 33501, 33501,

[03:13:29.240 --> 03:13:30.560]
South Dixie Highway, Florida City.

[03:13:30.840 --> 03:13:31.780]
Florida City, baby.

[03:13:31.880 --> 03:13:33.400]
I bet you we got a lot of listeners down there.

[03:13:34.140 --> 03:13:36.280]
Two, thirty to four, thirty to seven with our best meal merchandise.

[03:13:36.580 --> 03:13:39.340]
And maybe you can give me a little airplane spin while you're at it, too.

[03:13:40.320 --> 03:13:42.560]
Nine minutes till two at five, 60 QAM.

[03:13:42.560 --> 03:13:44.520]
Slide and local.

[03:13:44.920 --> 03:13:47.420]
We're sports radio five, 60 QAM.

[03:13:47.760 --> 03:13:48.640]
You A-M.

[03:13:50.180 --> 03:13:52.380]
Friday, you bastards.

[03:14:06.880 --> 03:14:10.580]
Sitting at home, watching Dwight Lutter Dale.

[03:14:10.580 --> 03:14:14.320]
Talking about how bombs are stealing 95s are rail.

[03:14:14.740 --> 03:14:18.220]
When sudden, Lee with a bullet tend to dish up.

[03:14:18.360 --> 03:14:21.680]
On to the screen came his partner and Bishop.

[03:14:21.680 --> 03:14:25.360]
She said this just end to eyewitness news.

[03:14:25.840 --> 03:14:32.940]
It's governor Martinez and the two live crew will have more details coming up at five, thirty.

[03:14:33.280 --> 03:14:36.560]
He pulled them from the stores because they so jerky.

[03:14:37.040 --> 03:14:38.540]
Oh, they're so dirty.

[03:14:38.540 --> 03:14:40.440]
Oh, they're so dirty.

[03:14:41.020 --> 03:14:42.180]
Oh, they're so dirty.

[03:14:42.600 --> 03:14:44.160]
They curse all the time.

[03:14:44.740 --> 03:14:45.920]
Oh, they're so dirty.

[03:14:46.380 --> 03:14:47.760]
So, so, so dirty.

[03:14:48.460 --> 03:14:49.680]
Oh, they're so dirty.

[03:14:50.040 --> 03:14:51.680]
They curse all the time.

[03:14:52.040 --> 03:14:54.920]
Bob had heard the album and he was a Paul.

[03:14:55.120 --> 03:14:56.920]
He said thank you Janet Reno.

[03:14:57.460 --> 03:14:58.620]
I'm glad that you're called.

[03:14:58.840 --> 03:15:01.720]
We got to take a stand against this 13.

[03:15:01.720 --> 03:15:06.120]
Rom, besides it's really close to election time.

[03:15:06.480 --> 03:15:09.980]
His Broward judge friend said I will not fail ya.

[03:15:10.280 --> 03:15:13.720]
Will censor any mention of Janet tell ya.

[03:15:13.980 --> 03:15:17.340]
They're selling sceptics going through puberty.

[03:15:17.840 --> 03:15:18.980]
The two live crew.

[03:15:19.240 --> 03:15:21.020]
Yeah, they so dirty.

[03:15:21.620 --> 03:15:22.940]
Oh, they're so dirty.

[03:15:23.740 --> 03:15:25.020]
Oh, they're so dirty.

[03:15:25.600 --> 03:15:26.680]
Oh, they're so dirty.

[03:15:27.080 --> 03:15:28.760]
They curse all the time.

[03:15:35.960 --> 03:15:39.860]
He could crap a butt to show he had guts.

[03:15:39.960 --> 03:15:43.200]
The most of the people said this guy is a pus.

[03:15:43.900 --> 03:15:47.100]
He rid the land of that noise delusion.

[03:15:47.700 --> 03:15:50.860]
Even though it went against a constitution.

[03:15:51.400 --> 03:15:54.460]
And what did Luke do during all of the jobs?

[03:15:54.880 --> 03:15:56.580]
So can thousand more copies.

[03:15:56.940 --> 03:15:58.740]
At 12.95, he bought a lot of money.

[03:15:58.740 --> 03:15:59.780]
He's got a brand new Mercedes.

[03:16:00.640 --> 03:16:03.800]
It's really perky driving into the bank.

[03:16:04.080 --> 03:16:05.620]
Cause he so dirty.

[03:16:06.220 --> 03:16:07.560]
Oh, they're so dirty.

[03:16:08.160 --> 03:16:09.660]
Oh, they're so dirty.

[03:16:10.060 --> 03:16:11.400]
Oh, they're so dirty.

[03:16:11.660 --> 03:16:13.360]
They curse all the time.

[03:16:13.860 --> 03:16:15.060]
Oh, they're so dirty.

[03:16:15.520 --> 03:16:16.860]
So, so dirty.

[03:16:17.420 --> 03:16:18.840]
Oh, they're so dirty.

[03:16:19.240 --> 03:16:20.800]
They curse all the time.

[03:16:21.100 --> 03:16:22.980]
156, 4-2 at 5-60.

[03:16:23.020 --> 03:16:24.640]
W-Q-M, the mad dog is standing by.

[03:16:24.640 --> 03:16:26.200]
He said the dolphins are going to the dogs.

[03:16:26.200 --> 03:16:26.800]
That's what he said.

[03:16:26.880 --> 03:16:27.420]
Something like that.

[03:16:27.460 --> 03:16:28.700]
He also said no mo.

[03:16:28.920 --> 03:16:29.700]
Nobody meant by that.

[03:16:29.760 --> 03:16:30.300]
He said no mo.

[03:16:30.380 --> 03:16:31.620]
We kept seeing it on the way out the door.

[03:16:32.120 --> 03:16:32.540]
Off the door.

[03:16:33.380 --> 03:16:34.440]
You got the hopper at 4.

[03:16:34.940 --> 03:16:36.040]
And then he's going to have the day wants that.

[03:16:36.040 --> 03:16:36.780]
You'll find the six.

[03:16:36.800 --> 03:16:42.500]
And of course, that's going to be really very interesting to hear what they want that has to say on the way out.

[03:16:43.500 --> 03:16:45.180]
The big ol' Orlando Alzeguiri at 7.

[03:16:45.180 --> 03:16:46.180]
And what's the story?

[03:16:46.300 --> 03:16:48.900]
It says at the Kendall Al House question mark.

[03:16:49.000 --> 03:16:49.880]
Do we have any update on that?

[03:16:49.960 --> 03:16:50.100]
No.

[03:16:50.440 --> 03:16:51.260]
Kendall Al House?

[03:16:53.280 --> 03:16:54.300]
There you go.

[03:16:54.440 --> 03:16:56.360]
The big ol'

[03:16:56.780 --> 03:16:59.820]
And then you got an AK after 10 o'clock tonight.

[03:16:59.960 --> 03:17:00.960]
ESPN Radio overnight.

[03:17:01.300 --> 03:17:02.260]
And a whole bunch of ball games.

[03:17:02.260 --> 03:17:02.860]
Man and stuff.

[03:17:03.180 --> 03:17:08.720]
You got Syracuse another girl school to get the hurricanes back into winning shape after two really bad and embarrassing humiliating weeks.

[03:17:08.860 --> 03:17:10.300]
Get everybody out of their saw remote.

[03:17:10.460 --> 03:17:12.260]
So they're playing little tiny girl school from Syracuse.

[03:17:13.580 --> 03:17:14.620]
The Orange Men.

[03:17:15.100 --> 03:17:16.840]
Little tiny are there about like this tall.

[03:17:16.920 --> 03:17:18.220]
The Orange Men are just going to step on them.

[03:17:18.480 --> 03:17:19.140]
Make an orange crush.

[03:17:20.080 --> 03:17:22.180]
And then you got the Baltimore Ravens against it offence.

[03:17:22.240 --> 03:17:26.220]
And of course, because Brian Greasey's playing even though the Ravens have no offense, we all know that.

[03:17:26.840 --> 03:17:28.940]
Because Brian's starting on Sunday could be pretty interesting.

[03:17:29.060 --> 03:17:29.280]
You know what?

[03:17:29.280 --> 03:17:31.700]
Hey Brian, quit falling down and quit doing it.

[03:17:32.120 --> 03:17:32.920]
Brian, quit doing that.

[03:17:33.020 --> 03:17:33.820]
Quit making that sound.

[03:17:34.320 --> 03:17:38.680]
So Gary says, who says that the risk of being a chronic factor because he just facts to good facts a little while ago.

[03:17:38.760 --> 03:17:39.920]
But that's okay. Some information.

[03:17:40.000 --> 03:17:42.560]
He says I believe the crowbar a lot of that silly show on 940.

[03:17:42.660 --> 03:17:44.080]
And is now playing ball in Japan.

[03:17:44.660 --> 03:17:46.280]
He's turning Japanese. How do you like that?

[03:17:46.480 --> 03:17:47.460]
Back in Japan.

[03:17:48.260 --> 03:17:50.960]
Yeah, because he's already played ball out there I believe.

[03:17:51.160 --> 03:17:51.820]
But he's still live there.

[03:17:52.200 --> 03:17:53.820]
Right? He speaks it fluently.

[03:17:53.920 --> 03:17:54.500]
He speaks Japanese?

[03:17:54.900 --> 03:17:57.900]
Yeah he does. Are you serious? Maybe that's where he got that talcum powder from.

[03:17:58.280 --> 03:17:59.860]
He speaks Japanese better than he does English.

[03:18:01.400 --> 03:18:02.240]
Oh, see.

[03:18:03.000 --> 03:18:04.680]
I almost was able to get out of here.

[03:18:04.820 --> 03:18:07.880]
We almost got to the end of the week and there's George starting up again.

[03:18:08.020 --> 03:18:11.520]
That was really bad. Are you suggesting that the crow speaks crowbonyx?

[03:18:11.560 --> 03:18:12.140]
Is that what you're saying?

[03:18:12.460 --> 03:18:13.280]
Yeah, but not in Japan.

[03:18:13.340 --> 03:18:14.840]
And he loves it by the way. The crow loves us.

[03:18:15.040 --> 03:18:16.220]
He loves crowbonyx. He loves it.

[03:18:17.020 --> 03:18:18.360]
Cashmere bouquet. He's a good guy.

[03:18:18.620 --> 03:18:20.140]
I love the crea is a great guy.

[03:18:20.560 --> 03:18:22.980]
He don't belong on a year and that's why he's playing ball in Japan again.

[03:18:24.040 --> 03:18:25.520]
Because he's busy turning Japanese.

[03:18:25.780 --> 03:18:28.140]
Okay, here this is the last time we're going to examine this here.

[03:18:28.400 --> 03:18:30.720]
Because starting Monday we move on to bigger and better upper things.

[03:18:31.120 --> 03:18:31.860]
Like out of town.

[03:18:32.640 --> 03:18:34.500]
What's your take on the firing a scot for well?

[03:18:34.520 --> 03:18:36.380]
That's our poll question of any arages.com.

[03:18:37.780 --> 03:18:38.540]

[03:18:38.780 --> 03:18:39.320]

[03:18:40.400 --> 03:18:41.160]
No, 751.

[03:18:41.340 --> 03:18:43.060]
Oh, you mean 250 bucks down there in a homestead?

[03:18:43.180 --> 03:18:44.660]
Thank you folks in homestead. Not bad.

[03:18:45.140 --> 03:18:45.620]
Not great.

[03:18:46.240 --> 03:18:47.220]
That was just phase one.

[03:18:47.780 --> 03:18:48.980]
Right, that was only phase one.

[03:18:48.980 --> 03:18:52.060]
You can move into phase two. Jim and Tammy Baker will sell you a beautiful condo for 10 million.

[03:18:52.720 --> 03:18:56.580]
And then Miguel the saffron floor to city Walmart SuperSetter 33501.

[03:18:57.040 --> 03:18:58.160]
33501 South Texas, you highway.

[03:18:58.460 --> 03:19:00.140]
230 to 430. Bring some cash.

[03:19:01.300 --> 03:19:02.520]
751 votes on for well.

[03:19:02.920 --> 03:19:04.980]
What's your take? Greg reads an asshole 206.

[03:19:05.980 --> 03:19:07.320]
I'm pissed. I loved for well 170.

[03:19:08.120 --> 03:19:09.720]
I don't care. Never listen to him. 106.

[03:19:10.020 --> 03:19:11.120]
No great loss. 77.

[03:19:11.440 --> 03:19:14.540]
And by the way, you know, Jack Thompson's been emailing Greg and Norm Kent.

[03:19:14.840 --> 03:19:17.540]
I want credit. I want more credit for the getting a for all fired.

[03:19:17.540 --> 03:19:18.800]
Okay, we'll give you all the credit.

[03:19:19.440 --> 03:19:21.760]
Jack Thompson and Moral Gables got the Scott for real far.

[03:19:21.840 --> 03:19:23.920]
Now you want all the credit. You got it.

[03:19:24.260 --> 03:19:25.240]
No great loss. 78.

[03:19:25.380 --> 03:19:26.800]
The radio business blow is 56.

[03:19:27.500 --> 03:19:29.380]
He had a coming. He's over the top 56.

[03:19:29.760 --> 03:19:31.360]
56. Q. 56.

[03:19:31.800 --> 03:19:33.500]
His voice nearly killed me 39.

[03:19:34.180 --> 03:19:37.240]
I hated him anyway 30 and Neil is much more vulgar only 12.

[03:19:38.200 --> 03:19:41.740]
Only 12 out of 757 votes said I'm much more vulgar.

[03:19:41.820 --> 03:19:43.680]
I'm much more dirty. How do you like that?

[03:19:45.320 --> 03:19:45.720]
Filthy.

[03:19:46.320 --> 03:19:46.720]
Disgusted.

[03:19:46.720 --> 03:19:47.140]
Viled.

[03:19:47.480 --> 03:19:48.280]
Grotesque. Old.

[03:19:48.640 --> 03:19:50.000]
And out of this joint.

[03:19:50.040 --> 03:19:50.920]
Bye bye bye.

[03:19:52.360 --> 03:19:53.320]
Thank God.

[03:19:53.720 --> 03:19:54.740]
Get me out of here.

[03:19:55.600 --> 03:19:57.160]
He's got a big heart on it.

[03:19:57.160 --> 03:19:57.560]
Good for him.

[03:19:57.980 --> 03:19:58.220]
Oh.
