[00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:09.580]
Friday night is in the White House doing all his presidential bill.

[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:18.060]
He's there in the Oval Office though he's not sure what an oval is.

[00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:26.260]
His practice in his speech that he's been working on for weeks should be a breeze.

[00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:35.140]
But it's not for a man who thinks that if you're from Iran, your ear will ease.

[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.760]
Saturday he's still no smarter.

[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.160]
Things went in the center, central gold.

[00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.840]
You could say his brain is useless, kind of like the Chinese clocked up, ventricles.

[00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.880]
Now he goes to give the speech with words his bow cap cannot reach. He looks so brave.

[00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:09.540]
But he won't tell you how he feels instead he'll talk about some bad mistakes he'll make.

[00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:19.880]
He can't spell, he cannot run out loud.

[00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:29.000]
He can't speak so what he says is always in doubt.

[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.460]
You'll never clue, you'll bring it instead.

[00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:41.200]
So he just babbles on.

[00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.540]
Babbles on.

[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.300]
He's got to give that ain't too bad.

[00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:09.420]
Same occupation as dad once had closes his eyes when he counts to ten.

[00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:12.060]
Helps him to remember all of them.

[00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.180]
Like the bush we had before he's got the same name on the Oval Office store.

[00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.520]
He's in there thinking unlike Clinton.

[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.540]
How to make this country wonderful again.

[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.480]
Open George W. You ain't like his dad when he courtesit more to bomb back dad.

[00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.820]
If Saddam wants another fight it might scare George and make him want to cry.

[00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.720]
Close his eyes when it goes to betting dreams of the recount making smile.

[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.200]
If you're better when you hear him say.

[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.500]
The USA will be wonderful someday.

[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:50.180]
He might promise us everything that don't need spittle and he's got to change me.

[00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.700]
To blame if something goes wrong.

[00:02:53.700 --> 00:03:00.280]
Once the press gets to him he'll realize the impressive ain't so wonderful.

[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:01.140]
Mal.

[00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.620]
Mal.

[00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:16.640]
Good morning, happy new year to you.

[00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.980]
It's 9.04.56.00 WQAM.

[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.560]
For those of you who haven't figured this out it's not George and it's not Neil.

[00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.420]
This is Carlos. I will be taking requests and playing some best of Neil tapes today.

[00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.060]
So give me a call off the air and I'll be happy to play anything you got.

[00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.340]
I'm honored to welcome so many people who devote their lives to the well-being of others,

[00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.340]
to the Rose Garden here in the White House.

[00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.740]
There are around 5 million hardcore users of the illegal drugs in America today.

[00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.960]
We must do and we will do drugs.

[00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.800]
We must increase the floor drugs into America.

[00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.840]
This will make working in close cooperation with Mexico a priority.

[00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.120]
And we emphatically disagree.

[00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.300]
There are American hearts being laid down in the bottom of our chests.

[00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.460]
About that special feeling we get in the cockles of our hearts.

[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.320]
Maybe below the cockles, maybe in the subcock area, maybe in the liver.

[00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:22.620]
Maybe in the kidneys. Maybe even in the colon. We don't know.

[00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:30.140]
I'm just a regular Joe with a regular job.

[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.060]
I'm your average white suburbanites.

[00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.400]
I like football and porn, I'm books about war.

[00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:45.060]
I got an average house where the nice hardwood floor, my wife and my job,

[00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:52.360]
my kids and my car. I'll feed on my table and a cube of six ago.

[00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:59.420]
But sometimes I just paint it up to keep a man like me.

[00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:05.900]
No way. No, I've got to go out and have fun.

[00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.920]
It's someone else's expense.

[00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:11.640]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:19.560]
I try really slow in the ultra fast lane while people behind me are going insane.

[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:32.160]
I use public toilets and I piss on the seat.

[00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:36.180]
I walk around in the summer time saying, how about this heat?

[00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:37.580]
I'm on a story.

[00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:52.900]
Sometimes I park in the handicap spaces while handicaps people make handicaps and faces.

[00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:54.180]
I'm on a story.

[00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.200]
I'm on a story.

[00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:05.160]
Maybe I shouldn't be singing this song.

[00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:09.180]
Ranting and raping and carrying on.

[00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:13.400]
Maybe they're right where they tell me I'm wrong.

[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.400]
I'm on an extra wheelie.

[00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.800]
Come on up to the road.

[00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:27.540]
You know what I'm going to do?

[00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:31.500]
I'm going to get myself a 1967 Cadillac Yolderado convertible.

[00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:37.660]
I paint with a whale skin off the caps and all other cow and carrier and big brown baby

[00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:38.980]
and I see a lion's red head lights.

[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:44.180]
I'm going to cry around on that baby at 150 miles per hour, getting one mile per gallon.

[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:48.920]
I'm on a port of mountains, burgers and McDonald's, the old fashioned not by the great old style of home containers.

[00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:53.440]
I'm going to run second down those grease ball burgers, I'm going to wipe my mom with the American flag

[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:56.140]
and then I'm going to toss the style of home containers right off the side.

[00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:58.740]
And then I'm going to cut them thing anybody can do about it.

[00:06:58.820 --> 00:06:59.240]
You know why?

[00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:01.500]
Because we got the bomb. That's why.

[00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:03.700]
Two words, nuclear f**king weapons.

[00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:07.900]
So they rush a Germany, Romania, they can have all the democracy they want.

[00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:11.040]
They can have a fifth democracy, cake walk right through the middle of the enemy square.

[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:13.760]
I don't make a lick of difference because we ain't got the bomb.

[00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:15.280]
So they've done ways.

[00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:19.420]
Now then, he's frozen and as soon as we find a cure for cancer we're going to throw out the Duke.

[00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:20.760]
And he's going to be pretty pissed off.

[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:21.340]
You know why?

[00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:24.780]
If the government's taking a cold shower, we multiply that by 15 million times.

[00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:26.380]
That's how pissed off the Duke's going to be.

[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:30.140]
I'm going to go to the Duke and John gets a lady and we marmin' a Sampeck and a B.

[00:07:30.140 --> 00:08:00.120]

for foot five kind around and faced he with a couple of

[00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:02.200]
kids and he was in charge of the Vatican Pope John

[00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:19.940]
you see the folks and freaks to get married back then and spread the money

[00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:22.220]

Pope John the scat the secret he didn't confess was that he was a pregnant girl

[00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:48.220]
biggest

[00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:50.080]
cars and boats

[00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:51.920]
now we're talking about bridges over the

[00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:53.440]
causeway not the ones in your mouth

[00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:56.020]
I don't have any of my friends

[00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:56.940]
okay

[00:28:56.940 --> 00:28:57.640]

before I put it deep breath

[00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:02.680]
but it's regulated by the United States Corps of Engineers

[00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:03.320]

navid blue waterway

[00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:09.960]

[00:29:10.340 --> 00:29:11.100]
but that

[00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:13.020]
I said if I knew the answer to the question

[00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:14.500]
I wouldn't have asked it in the first place

[00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:16.300]
okay well all I'm saying sir

[00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:19.040]
is that the United States Corps of Engineers

[00:29:19.780 --> 00:29:21.180]
are the ones that regulate

[00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:22.160]
bridges over

[00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:23.700]
navid blue waterways

[00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:24.280]
over one

[00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:26.360]
navid blue waterway

[00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:27.160]
yes sir okay

[00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:27.840]

[00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:28.280]
yeah

[00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:30.380]
so it's up to them to decide

[00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:32.040]
what time

[00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:34.420]
the bridges should not be open

[00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:36.780]
to the marine traffic

[00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:37.220]
yes

[00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:40.960]
and what time should they not be open to marine traffic sir

[00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:43.740]
I'm telling you that they

[00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:45.760]
come up with the times

[00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:47.040]
well what is the time

[00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:51.760]
I believe it's at wish our times sir

[00:29:52.820 --> 00:29:55.540]
that they are not open to marine traffic

[00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:58.160]
other than that they are open to marine traffic

[00:29:58.160 --> 00:30:01.300]
so in other words any schlep with a boat can come along and back up traffic

[00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:01.980]
for too long

[00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:03.720]
that is absolutely correct sir

[00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:05.900]
well what kind of a comment is much a crap is that

[00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:08.000]
that is not a communist bunch of crap sir

[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.760]
sounds like some kind of the end of all

[00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:11.220]
fascist honey pinko

[00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:13.140]
you got five people in the blue

[00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:14.300]
beos to one boat

[00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:15.360]
wait exactly

[00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:17.740]
the boat is going to stop the 5,000 cars

[00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:19.760]
is that it?

[00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:23.560]
no I think that 50,000 cars ought to stop for one jack as in his boat

[00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:24.960]
I think that's what they ought to do

[00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:29.380]
man you better know your laws mr because you sure don't

[00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:29.860]
that's right

[00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:32.200]
I suppose you want the van brigad closed

[00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:34.640]
to both traffic and the hurricane too

[00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:37.160]
I want the bridges closed period okay

[00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:38.620]
I want them closed I want the bridge

[00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:39.720]
tent to go home and watch

[00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:41.780]
his MTV and get the hell out of our life

[00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:44.040]
you know the way I want those bridges closed

[00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:45.880]

[00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:47.320]

all I was trying to do was deal with the reality of sex and teenagers

[00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:03.340]
maybe if jesse hums at both the chapel new gang rich have butters of corn a little

[00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:05.200]

[00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:10.080]
flogging the dog never hurt anybody and if people did a little more of it we

[00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:14.000]
might say some lies hell if clinton just stayed home and spanked a monkey

[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:18.340]
he'd even be in less hot water teaching kids about masturbation would be

[00:33:18.340 --> 00:33:23.180]
no big deal we could even take some standard teaching tools and just twist them

[00:33:23.180 --> 00:33:28.000]
around a little bit like see dick run when you see dick run

[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:31.680]

pump the python walk the door wax the carrot or tickle the taco

[00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:53.400]

[00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:57.360]
we're working on a story about uh... the city here promoting on your website

[00:38:57.360 --> 00:39:00.620]

i guess i am i've been listening to a couple days and just you know we are

[00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:09.260]
did you did you hear me go through the entire uh... rationale what that that

[00:39:09.260 --> 00:39:11.400]
song had nothing to do with kindleysa rice

[00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:16.520]
what about the song kindleysa kindleysa that has that that's obviously about

[00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:20.900]
kindleysa and i want to know why you're why you're playing this on your show

[00:39:21.860 --> 00:39:24.780]
i see i'd like to know why you know that this is really interesting

[00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:28.140]
why are you calling me asking me why should play this we make we have song

[00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:31.720]
parodies about bill clinton dozens of them nobody ever complained about that

[00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:35.380]
we have some parodies about al Gore dozens of them nobody ever complained about

[00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:35.800]
those

[00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:39.900]
about that i think i think american folks up in here in the york were pre-offended

[00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:43.760]
by it and you want to let me say this to you care we're not in new york

[00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:47.460]
uh... okay we don't broadcast in the york were on wqm in my army and and

[00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:50.700]
effect of the matter is that i'm not except for people like you and the people

[00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:54.160]
at the that right wing newsmax dot com will make a big simmiss about this

[00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:56.600]
if we're for that they wouldn't be aware that we exist

[00:39:56.600 --> 00:39:59.620]
the over the month this organization that up

[00:39:59.620 --> 00:40:03.540]
offended by it as a national organization but but the fact of the fact of the

[00:40:03.540 --> 00:40:07.280]
matter is we've been playing these songs for many many many months we've never

[00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:11.320]
had one single complaint and when interlopers like you from outside like from

[00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:15.080]
fox news are from some right wing website want to tell us what i mean for you

[00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:17.340]
to ask me how come you're playing that because we want to play it

[00:40:17.340 --> 00:40:20.980]
okay me i want what's coming what is it what is it what is it what is it do for

[00:40:20.980 --> 00:40:24.560]
you what is it called it's called comedy that's what it's called you have a sense

[00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:29.060]
of humor do you think it's funny how uh... they call connolly the right in and it's

[00:40:29.060 --> 00:40:31.620]
in it in it in it in it in it in it in it in it in it in it in it well here you

[00:40:31.620 --> 00:40:34.340]
bella funny called her the house Negro case of a color whatever we want

[00:40:34.340 --> 00:40:39.580]
but this is a little bit different i mean it's not good it's not the least bit

[00:40:39.580 --> 00:40:43.020]
different she is the house they receive people at fox made out understand this

[00:40:43.020 --> 00:40:45.880]
not everybody in the world is the right wing or like we put more dot they're

[00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:49.060]
actually are those of us who are progressive or moderate liberal whatever we are

[00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:51.920]
who also have the right to speak to express whatever help we want

[00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:55.760]
so it's a what repeat again what you just had for me there you think she is a

[00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:56.000]
what

[00:40:56.660 --> 00:40:57.920]
she's the house negro

[00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:01.760]

[00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:05.480]
well what you mean wrong with that it's a fact that's my opinion in my title

[00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:06.860]
my opinion you're certainly a

[00:41:06.860 --> 00:41:07.620]
and i don't hear

[00:41:08.540 --> 00:41:13.720]

[00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:16.160]
obviously this is why nobody returned your calls

[00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:17.520]
uh...

[00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:18.380]
whether whatever your name is

[00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:21.040]
uh... because we knew that you were trying to stir up a bunch of crap and

[00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:22.200]
take something out of context

[00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:23.880]
when i asked you to do that

[00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:28.000]

[00:41:37.180 --> 00:41:40.540]
was very common i think you did you hear me explain the origin of that song

[00:41:40.540 --> 00:41:41.740]
the rest of the two-ton song

[00:41:41.740 --> 00:41:44.280]

[00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:07.680]
Hello.

[00:47:08.100 --> 00:47:11.060]
Hello, I was calling about the watt, but you have to settle in a paper.

[00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:14.320]
What kind of wavits are they?

[00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:16.780]
I have some lops.

[00:47:17.420 --> 00:47:22.700]
I have some lops. Some spotty lops and some solid colored lops.

[00:47:23.140 --> 00:47:24.000]
Oh, wonderful.

[00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:28.060]
And I have a straight ear dough and I have two dwarfs.

[00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:29.980]
What a dwarf.

[00:47:30.300 --> 00:47:31.260]
They're small radies.

[00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:36.940]
Oh, okay. We have a farm and we like to play with the wavits on a farm.

[00:47:38.620 --> 00:47:42.060]
You wouldn't happen to have any like little wavit handcuffs.

[00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:44.140]
Do you want?

[00:47:44.540 --> 00:47:46.980]
Little handcuffs for a wavit.

[00:47:47.420 --> 00:47:48.240]
A handcuffs?

[00:47:48.540 --> 00:47:48.760]
Yes.

[00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:50.980]
I'm sorry, I never heard of them.

[00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:51.900]
What's going on?

[00:47:52.040 --> 00:47:54.480]
Well, we used them when we hunt them on the farm.

[00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:57.320]
We like to hunt the wavits.

[00:47:58.120 --> 00:48:01.520]
And we take them and nail them to a tweed by their ears and in skin and moway.

[00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:08.860]
Hello.

[00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:13.320]
And now I think that's what you don't do at taste, rabbit.

[00:48:13.500 --> 00:48:14.880]
Sir, I couldn't say you're a rabbit.

[00:48:15.340 --> 00:48:19.040]
We have a little game we play called all wavits must die.

[00:48:19.900 --> 00:48:22.080]
No, sir, no, sir, no, sir.

[00:48:22.940 --> 00:48:26.140]
I wouldn't say you're a rabbit at first.

[00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:27.100]
50 dollars.

[00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:28.620]
I like to hunt the wavits.

[00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:31.760]
Well, that's okay. You go out in the wild and you hunt rabbits.

[00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:32.960]
But they aren't for kill.

[00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:36.600]
I like to put them in a little pin and then hunt them down unmaskably.

[00:48:36.860 --> 00:48:38.100]
No, sir, I'm sorry.

[00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:39.580]
And say you're a rabbit.

[00:48:39.820 --> 00:48:43.260]
Sometimes we even spare them to the head with a wasty water.

[00:48:47.480 --> 00:48:56.980]
Ooh, I need your love, John.

[00:48:57.800 --> 00:48:59.680]
Yes, you know it's true.

[00:49:00.680 --> 00:49:04.000]
I hope you'll need my love, John.

[00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:09.160]

[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:14.400]
Touch me, use me, bust me.

[00:49:15.060 --> 00:49:17.900]
I need my share of love, John.

[00:49:19.120 --> 00:49:20.520]
Eight times a day.

[00:49:21.760 --> 00:49:24.800]
I love you every day, John.

[00:49:25.420 --> 00:49:28.000]
Just look straight after blinds.

[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:31.900]
I think this is my best side.

[00:49:32.260 --> 00:49:34.340]
Get a tight shot of my behind.

[00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:36.900]
Oh, oh, oh, me.

[00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:42.100]
Touch me, use me, bust me.

[00:49:42.760 --> 00:49:45.600]
I need my share of love, John.

[00:49:46.840 --> 00:49:48.220]
Eight times a day.

[00:49:49.360 --> 00:49:51.960]
Eight times a day.

[00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:55.520]
It's just a low-ball average.

[00:49:56.520 --> 00:49:59.420]
Eight times a day.

[00:49:59.420 --> 00:50:03.700]
It's just a low-ball average.

[00:50:03.700 --> 00:50:06.480]
Ooh, I need your love, John.

[00:50:07.100 --> 00:50:08.260]
Yes, you know it's true.

[00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:13.420]
I hope you'll need my love, John.

[00:50:14.080 --> 00:50:16.200]
My house payment is you.

[00:50:16.740 --> 00:50:18.600]
Oh, oh, oh, me.

[00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:23.860]
Touch me, use me, bust me.

[00:50:23.860 --> 00:50:27.320]
I need my share of love, John.

[00:50:28.080 --> 00:50:30.020]
Eight times a day.

[00:50:31.020 --> 00:50:33.780]
Eight times a day.

[00:50:34.580 --> 00:50:37.380]
To teach my husband how to.

[00:50:38.660 --> 00:50:40.760]
Eight times a day.

[00:50:41.620 --> 00:50:44.880]
It's good to see you, Danny Quail.

[00:50:45.580 --> 00:50:48.220]
Love me every day, John.

[00:50:48.880 --> 00:50:50.880]
You're always on my tail.

[00:50:51.820 --> 00:50:55.300]
Make me scream for pain, John.

[00:50:55.680 --> 00:50:58.100]
Cause soon I'll be in jail.

[00:50:58.640 --> 00:51:00.500]
Oh, oh, oh, me.

[00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:05.880]
Touch me, use me, bust me.

[00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:09.340]
I need my share of love, John.

[00:51:10.500 --> 00:51:11.900]
Eight times a day.

[00:51:13.160 --> 00:51:15.360]
Eight times a day.

[00:51:16.940 --> 00:51:19.040]
Eight times a day.

[00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:26.600]
Eight times a day.

[00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:29.900]
We are ECTIOs.

[00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:32.640]
In direction time.

[00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:36.300]
I'm gonna pick up my shoes, strip off my dress.

[00:51:36.900 --> 00:51:42.840]
It makes me wet when I see you get a big erection.

[00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:45.620]
That's too big for my mouth.

[00:51:46.620 --> 00:51:49.860]
I want it mercenary and a cup of juice.

[00:51:50.740 --> 00:51:53.500]
And take it up my lubricated food shoes.

[00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:58.940]
Give me an erection and they'll be to the wall.

[00:52:00.380 --> 00:52:03.260]
E-R-E-C-T-I-O-N.

[00:52:03.840 --> 00:52:05.820]
I wanna drink your balls.

[00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:10.180]
I want your love and what we ought to be when you shoot your own thing.

[00:52:10.840 --> 00:52:12.600]
And then I'll give it a blow.

[00:52:13.600 --> 00:52:16.640]
Give the warning it gets and big it gets.

[00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:19.820]
And we've done till you take up this.

[00:52:20.200 --> 00:52:23.480]
I wanna wrap my lips around your cold thing too.

[00:52:24.260 --> 00:52:26.600]
And make your wonder where we're going soon.

[00:52:27.580 --> 00:52:29.980]
That's the way right, John.

[00:52:30.700 --> 00:52:32.740]
And it's unferconcised.

[00:52:33.940 --> 00:52:36.720]
E-R-E-C-T-I-O-N.

[00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:39.300]
I wanna drink your balls.

[00:52:40.300 --> 00:52:43.480]
E-R-E-C-T-I-O-N.

[00:52:43.820 --> 00:52:46.060]
I wanna drink your balls.

[00:52:48.100 --> 00:52:50.280]
Goodbye, Chris Barley.

[00:52:51.260 --> 00:52:52.280]
You great big fatty.

[00:52:52.940 --> 00:52:57.400]
Always acting like a great big fat dumb retard.

[00:52:58.140 --> 00:53:00.840]
In every field you've ever made.

[00:53:02.700 --> 00:53:04.760]
Too bad for David's fate.

[00:53:06.040 --> 00:53:08.640]
His career could fade cause.

[00:53:09.260 --> 00:53:11.660]
All he has left is that label.

[00:53:12.240 --> 00:53:16.340]
TV show he won't be making bloody movies no more.

[00:53:18.920 --> 00:53:22.800]
As he wants it to be just like John Balushi.

[00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:25.740]
And have drawn candy's chips.

[00:53:26.920 --> 00:53:28.680]
You finally made it.

[00:53:29.180 --> 00:53:33.360]
But we're not too careful what you wish.

[00:53:34.880 --> 00:53:40.840]
You gave us lots of laughter on Saturday night.

[00:53:41.340 --> 00:53:44.840]
But you were way too young to die.

[00:53:45.280 --> 00:53:48.480]
To commit bad men to a side.

[00:53:51.760 --> 00:53:53.360]
Goodbye, Chris Barley.

[00:53:54.380 --> 00:53:58.660]
What did you eat to blow up like a big balloon.

[00:53:59.160 --> 00:54:00.500]
Eating like a fool.

[00:54:00.500 --> 00:54:04.080]
That would only bring you certain death.

[00:54:05.500 --> 00:54:07.820]
The farmers are upset.

[00:54:09.580 --> 00:54:16.380]
And all you left was some cable movies and a few pairs of your pants.

[00:54:16.860 --> 00:54:20.340]
That will fill to make community poos.

[00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:26.060]
And you wanted to be just like John Balushi.

[00:54:26.740 --> 00:54:29.120]
And have drawn candy's chips.

[00:54:30.120 --> 00:54:31.880]
You finally made it.

[00:54:32.280 --> 00:54:37.200]
But we're not too careful what you wish.

[00:54:38.260 --> 00:54:41.260]
Your cast has been hold of piano.

[00:54:41.900 --> 00:54:43.960]
That's six feet wide.

[00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:48.120]
Now you reach the pizza in the sky.

[00:54:48.820 --> 00:54:51.360]
You got so fat you died.

[00:54:53.080 --> 00:54:55.180]
Chris Barley the night they had some broadon.

[00:54:55.180 --> 00:54:58.140]
They're one of the tabloids shows last night.

[00:54:58.140 --> 00:54:59.760]
The night before he croaked.

[00:55:00.100 --> 00:55:05.740]
How much heroin and coke and fish food and whatever else he was doing.

[00:55:05.900 --> 00:55:06.280]
All together.

[00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:08.400]
And vodka on top of it.

[00:55:08.700 --> 00:55:11.640]
You got to wash it down with some good vodka.

[00:55:12.400 --> 00:55:13.700]
That's what Boris said.

[00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:16.680]
It wasn't bad enough that he was doing a hero.

[00:55:17.160 --> 00:55:18.800]
So he's dead Chris Barley.

[00:55:19.220 --> 00:55:20.900]
This guy comparing.

[00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:25.320]
Who cares about that.

[00:55:25.740 --> 00:55:28.720]
Why don't we get all upset if they're beaten up their wife and their girlfriend.

[00:55:28.900 --> 00:55:29.900]
Why don't we get upset about that.

[00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:34.680]
How come nobody gave a crap at the Jimmy Johnson side of Lawrence Phillips who's up about a goddamn gangster.

[00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:36.480]
How come that nobody cared about that.

[00:55:36.940 --> 00:55:39.340]
But we're concerned if he passes a drug test or not.

[00:55:39.500 --> 00:55:41.680]
That really concerns me whether he's smoking marijuana.

[00:55:42.180 --> 00:55:44.260]
Not whether he's going to be beaten women up all over the place.

[00:55:44.940 --> 00:55:47.800]
What kind of mentality we be talking about in this country man.

[00:55:47.940 --> 00:55:48.760]
We're talking about people.

[00:55:48.860 --> 00:55:52.820]
They can't sit down and look at this thing rationally because most of them are emotional cripples.

[00:55:54.940 --> 00:55:58.140]
And this crap about the NBA is going to do pot testing.

[00:55:58.360 --> 00:56:00.760]
David Robinson says, oh yeah, we should all subject to it.

[00:56:00.880 --> 00:56:01.660]
It's a no brainer.

[00:56:01.780 --> 00:56:03.360]
The NBA has a no brainer.

[00:56:03.420 --> 00:56:05.800]
Okay. It's for a bunch of illiterate freaks is what it is.

[00:56:05.920 --> 00:56:06.560]
David Robinson.

[00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:07.680]
You asshole.

[00:56:08.060 --> 00:56:08.640]
Here's Miami.

[00:56:08.660 --> 00:56:09.020]
Hello.

[00:56:09.220 --> 00:56:09.840]
A meal.

[00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:10.360]
Yes, sir.

[00:56:10.560 --> 00:56:11.140]
How you doing?

[00:56:11.320 --> 00:56:11.580]
Okay.

[00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:12.640]
You sound pit dog.

[00:56:13.160 --> 00:56:13.800]
Go ahead, sir.

[00:56:13.840 --> 00:56:14.200]
I'm listening.

[00:56:14.380 --> 00:56:17.140]
Okay. Well, anyway, on the second hand smoke with the marijuana.

[00:56:17.680 --> 00:56:23.920]
I have a friend who basically did not smoke because of the government watching over him.

[00:56:24.200 --> 00:56:24.380]
Yeah.

[00:56:24.840 --> 00:56:27.740]
And he enjoys burning every couple of times.

[00:56:27.940 --> 00:56:33.980]
So when he went to get a mandatory, you know, pissed us and he came back positive.

[00:56:34.040 --> 00:56:39.920]
He told his, his probation officer, he's like, oh no, I was in a room with a bunch of people smoking.

[00:56:40.300 --> 00:56:40.440]
Yeah.

[00:56:40.660 --> 00:56:43.840]
And the probation officer gave him a bunch of like evidence.

[00:56:43.840 --> 00:56:46.760]
I got a great bit for Bulk of Brian by the way of the two in a second hand row.

[00:56:47.020 --> 00:56:48.440]
A second hand smoke, but anyway.

[00:56:48.940 --> 00:56:49.500]
Go ahead.

[00:56:49.780 --> 00:57:00.260]
Anyway, he says that the probation officer gave him a bunch of evidence about how much second hand smoke you had to be in exposed to for you to come back positive for even a miniscule amount.

[00:57:00.380 --> 00:57:05.640]
You had to be in a room that was spogged up for a couple of hours, you know, constantly breathing it.

[00:57:05.820 --> 00:57:06.040]
Yeah.

[00:57:06.180 --> 00:57:12.940]
And I mean, if you smoke pot in the bath at any point, if you like to smoke that stuff and you're in a room and they've been smoking it for two hours,

[00:57:12.940 --> 00:57:14.940]
you're going to tell me you're not going to take a hit or whatever.

[00:57:15.360 --> 00:57:16.720]
And I mean, snowboarders.

[00:57:16.720 --> 00:57:18.540]
So, so, so, so let me ask you so what I good did.

[00:57:18.880 --> 00:57:21.380]
Well, no, wait, oh, I want to hear this about snowboarding. Let's hear this.

[00:57:21.660 --> 00:57:26.440]
No, I mean, snowboarding into Olympics, who is not going to think that these snowboarders are not pot addicts?

[00:57:26.540 --> 00:57:29.940]
Give me a big, all these guys are a bunch of pot addicts.

[00:57:30.800 --> 00:57:31.660]
Pot addicts, oh yeah.

[00:57:31.920 --> 00:57:33.900]
I mean, they are the biggest burnouts.

[00:57:34.080 --> 00:57:35.640]
All the surfers I knew in high school.

[00:57:35.820 --> 00:57:37.780]
Yes, surfers and snowboarders, there you go.

[00:57:37.800 --> 00:57:40.120]
I love your logic, man. This is great.

[00:57:40.120 --> 00:57:42.200]
I mean, just follow the bouncing dots.

[00:57:42.200 --> 00:57:46.140]
Here we go from A to Z to T to, uh, to FU.

[00:57:46.240 --> 00:57:47.780]
Okay, great, great job, pal. Excellent.

[00:57:48.160 --> 00:57:49.600]
That could have been the greatest call in history.

[00:57:50.200 --> 00:57:54.020]
Oh, man, those, those chronic pot heads, man, those snowboarders.

[00:57:54.360 --> 00:57:57.040]
I wonder about Sandra Schmurler, the curler. I wonder what she's doing.

[00:57:57.620 --> 00:57:59.760]
She's probably got her hair up in curlers that bitch.

[00:58:00.300 --> 00:58:03.700]
Oh, and Sweden, by the way, when a woman's curling mites against Canada.

[00:58:04.040 --> 00:58:04.840]
Oh, my God.

[00:58:05.300 --> 00:58:09.080]
The Canadians, like 95% of all curlers in the world are Canadians,

[00:58:09.220 --> 00:58:12.420]
and they already lost one match between that and maybe losing this gold medal.

[00:58:12.420 --> 00:58:13.640]
They may never come out of hiding.

[00:58:13.940 --> 00:58:17.560]
They may like start doing like the Eskimos and build igloos and go inside and never come out.

[00:58:17.820 --> 00:58:18.800]
Come out, oot.

[00:58:19.380 --> 00:58:20.860]
Here's a mobile lady in Hollywood. Hello.

[00:58:21.240 --> 00:58:22.640]
Hello, Neil. Yes, ma'am.

[00:58:22.760 --> 00:58:25.800]
Good morning. I, this is the first time I'm calling you.

[00:58:25.940 --> 00:58:30.980]
However, I listen to you for years and I do admire many of the things that you say.

[00:58:30.980 --> 00:58:37.160]
But, however, I take issue a little bit this morning with the pot testing with regard to your employment.

[00:58:37.700 --> 00:58:46.360]
There are some situations where it is very dangerous to smoke pot, particularly if you like to drink beer, lunch, or even have a drink at lunch,

[00:58:46.400 --> 00:58:50.360]
and you mix it with the pot. There are things you can do that you normally wouldn't do.

[00:58:50.440 --> 00:58:50.840]
Like what?

[00:58:51.140 --> 00:58:56.000]
Well, for example, I know of a personal experience because it happened to be an insurance agent,

[00:58:56.000 --> 00:59:05.900]
and we have a very serious situation that occurred in one of our insured business operation where the man did that just that at lunch time.

[00:59:06.260 --> 00:59:12.720]
He came back and then the job that he had been working on for 10 years stuck his hand in the mixing bat and cut it off.

[00:59:12.920 --> 00:59:16.160]
All right. Excellent. Well, I'll let him teach him. I guess he won't be doing that again.

[00:59:16.360 --> 00:59:17.180]
No, I guess he won't.

[00:59:17.240 --> 00:59:18.000]
So what's the problem?

[00:59:18.260 --> 00:59:23.480]
Well, the problem is that drug testing on the job is in many cases very important.

[00:59:23.480 --> 00:59:27.700]
And so if you smoke pot, you shouldn't be doing it while you're working.

[00:59:27.940 --> 00:59:29.620]
I mean, maybe if you're working in a job in a job in a job.

[00:59:29.620 --> 00:59:32.420]
Well, wait a minute. You said you shouldn't be doing it while you're working,

[00:59:32.540 --> 00:59:37.740]
but if it stays in your system for up to a month, then how do you know when you're doing it?

[00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:42.920]
Well, I suppose you smoke it recreationally on a weekend at home, not when you're on a job.

[00:59:43.300 --> 00:59:46.980]
Well, I don't know very much about how long it stays in your system.

[00:59:47.160 --> 00:59:48.760]
I just got through telling you up to a month.

[00:59:49.020 --> 00:59:50.820]
What about beer testing after lunch?

[00:59:50.820 --> 00:59:53.400]
Yeah, that's right. How about booze testing after lunch?

[00:59:53.520 --> 00:59:54.400]
Well, let me tell you something.

[00:59:54.820 --> 00:59:55.860]
How about those kind of...

[00:59:55.860 --> 00:59:57.840]
How about those breathalyzer tests after lunch?

[00:59:58.000 --> 00:59:58.760]
Well, I don't...

[00:59:58.760 --> 01:00:01.260]
I mean, where do we stop this insanity is what I say?

[01:00:01.460 --> 01:00:05.340]
Well, actually, I really do believe that we have become insane with testing,

[01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:11.140]
except that in the case of drugs, it is a very important thing in some situation.

[01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:14.660]
I'm not saying that we should be testing everybody for everything,

[01:00:15.020 --> 01:00:17.960]
because we're losing totally our rights in this country.

[01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:23.160]
We don't have any rights in this country. We have a right to be oppressed by a fascist police state is what we have.

[01:00:23.160 --> 01:00:25.960]
We don't have any rights. This isn't a free country. It's a joke.

[01:00:26.180 --> 01:00:30.040]
Hey, listen, we still have the right to talk to you about these things which makes it a right.

[01:00:30.220 --> 01:00:30.420]
Yeah.

[01:00:30.980 --> 01:00:34.140]
Unfortunately, we're limited as to what we can say.

[01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:38.140]
Debbie, you still got to watch your language or the word police are going to come down and take you away.

[01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:42.260]
Well, that's something else again. I don't agree with that either.

[01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:44.820]
I think if you want to say all things, you can say them,

[01:00:44.820 --> 01:00:49.740]
and that shouldn't be oppressed by anybody, and whether it's on the radio or TV or wherever.

[01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:54.700]
But the point is that I don't know if you agree to this completely,

[01:00:54.820 --> 01:01:00.120]
maybe impartially you agree that there are certain situations where drug testing,

[01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:04.380]
whether it be marijuana or heroin or whatever, is an important factor.

[01:01:04.380 --> 01:01:08.200]
I would say if you're working in a candy store, then they definitely should be able to drug testing.

[01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:11.180]
You don't want somebody or any kind of a restaurant. They don't want you to have the profits.

[01:01:11.380 --> 01:01:12.880]
Right, don't have a shop. That would be a good one.

[01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:17.640]
Have a great day, sweetheart. We have an open line in date, 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, and pound 5, 60.

[01:01:17.940 --> 01:01:21.660]
Because God forbid, if you smoked weed like two weekends ago and you had a beer for lunch today,

[01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:25.580]
we know that you are a danger to society. God forbid.

[01:01:26.260 --> 01:01:28.200]
Pizza chef or delivery boys definitely.

[01:01:28.420 --> 01:01:32.420]
Yeah, that's right. Chinese food delivery guy, Don Delawese, he would never.

[01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:34.340]
And he didn't even have to smoke weed. How do you like that?

[01:01:34.860 --> 01:01:37.760]
And he still had the munchies. He was a hungry boy.

[01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:40.520]
He was just a big chubby, hungry guy. That's all.

[01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:44.200]
And he ate all $40 worth of Chinese food on the way back to the house.

[01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:47.580]
Can you imagine if they tested radio management for alcohol after lunch?

[01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:49.780]
Oh, yeah. If they went up there right now.

[01:01:50.140 --> 01:01:54.100]
Oh, my God. How about brain testing for management? That sounds good to me.

[01:01:54.700 --> 01:01:58.040]
Of course, where there's no sense, there's no feeling. Here's North Miami. Hello.

[01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:01.040]
Hello. Yes, sir. Yeah, you doing Neil? Great.

[01:02:02.180 --> 01:02:03.920]
I have a question. Yes.

[01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:06.480]
I have two questions and then I want to say something about the fire.

[01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:10.200]
How come you can't get ice cream like Italy here?

[01:02:10.380 --> 01:02:13.960]
Because I have a lot of pistachio. I don't eat a lot of ice cream, but man, I used to eat it.

[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.740]
I eat it every day in Italy. The stash of ice cream in Italy.

[01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:20.800]
Gelato sir, gelato is not ice cream. It's gelato. It's made with, doesn't have all that cream.

[01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:23.860]
And it's not all that chalk and artificial crap.

[01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:26.460]
It's made from all natural stuff. And they don't make it here.

[01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:29.680]
You know, once in a while a place will come along and try to make good gelato.

[01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:32.760]
And even if it is good, the public's taste here is so bad because they're busy eating

[01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:36.080]
buyers and seal-fests and eat these that those places go out of business.

[01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:41.260]
Man, I used to eat. I mean, I don't, I'm not an ice creamer, but I was eating it every day, twice a day.

[01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:42.880]
Yeah. I mean, every little shop had it.

[01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:45.460]
Well, when I go to Italy, I eat it a lot and I scream too.

[01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:48.660]
Hey, and I have a question for George.

[01:02:49.260 --> 01:02:53.700]
You guys used to have this commercial called Field Extreme Watches. Was it his voice, honey?

[01:02:54.060 --> 01:02:55.820]
Yes. Oh, I thought.

[01:02:55.820 --> 01:02:58.800]
Yeah, he apologizes profusely for it, too.

[01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:01.400]
And about that, let me ask you a question.

[01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:05.300]
If this guy would have been from Amsterdam or it's legal to smoke pot, what were they going to say to the guy?

[01:03:05.500 --> 01:03:08.220]
Well, you know, it's interesting because that, now that is a good point.

[01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:14.000]
Merriwana, they were just saying on CNN that Merriwana is not among the substances listed at the Olympics as being illegal,

[01:03:14.260 --> 01:03:17.320]
but that it reverts back to the country and the laws there.

[01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:22.980]
So if it were one of the Dutch players in like a soccer player, of course they're not playing on soccer in the winter or a little bit,

[01:03:22.980 --> 01:03:27.060]
but whatever the Dutch competitors are, ice skater, then it would not be a problem.

[01:03:27.180 --> 01:03:31.300]
How do you like that? Canada says that's blatantly unfair in a bunch of crap and they're requiring foul.

[01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:32.060]
Hey.

[01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:34.900]
Oh, boy. That's not. I don't think that's very fair.

[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:35.580]
How do you like that?

[01:03:36.220 --> 01:03:37.760]
How do you like that green apple, sir?

[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:39.140]
Those green apple, I don't know.

[01:03:39.140 --> 01:03:45.400]
So I say that this guy, this Graziano or Greg Gabriotti, I say he should move to Amsterdam would be a good idea.

[01:03:45.740 --> 01:03:46.600]
Hey, there you go.

[01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:47.700]
Least he'd have a good time.

[01:03:48.140 --> 01:03:50.240]
And as far as drug testing in the workplace?

[01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:50.620]
Yes.

[01:03:50.620 --> 01:03:57.400]
So they can figure out, it's a they can drug test you at the moment and know how much you've had at that particular moment.

[01:03:57.700 --> 01:04:02.560]
I think they should just band it all together because there's no way that you're going to tell me what I have to do in my house.

[01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:07.080]
In my car, or what I do at any time, then I'm not at work because I only work for them for eight hours.

[01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:08.340]
Not the rest of my day.

[01:04:08.540 --> 01:04:10.100]
So that's the bottom line with that.

[01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:12.160]
Next thing they're going to be doing fish food testing.

[01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:15.920]
Hey, there you go. Yeah, why don't we just survey and see your fat.

[01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:18.220]
I want you to visit see how much food you've been eating.

[01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:19.240]
Right. Exactly.

[01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:21.960]
Yeah, I mean, what do you draw the line? You know what I mean?

[01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:24.720]
Let me get a cute to have been checked this woman mouth.

[01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:26.940]
Maybe she's been giving moral sex to somebody in the parking lot.

[01:04:26.940 --> 01:04:29.040]
All right. Now you're talking. Okay. Have a great day pal.

[01:04:29.140 --> 01:04:29.540]
How you do?

[01:04:29.640 --> 01:04:31.420]
Okay. Sounds like a job he wants.

[01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:32.460]
I did that one time.

[01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:34.020]
It was about 15 years old.

[01:04:34.300 --> 01:04:35.620]
And there I go.

[01:04:37.180 --> 01:04:39.420]
Welcome to the clear channel collective.

[01:04:39.880 --> 01:04:41.340]
You have been assimilated.

[01:04:41.780 --> 01:04:45.320]
Resistance is futile and will result in your termination.

[01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:53.360]
We know what's best for radio and you will be required to assist in the assimilation of all relative radio stations.

[01:04:54.040 --> 01:04:58.680]
Irrelevant radio stations will become all news and left to die.

[01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:09.120]
Since talent is expensive, they will be transported to what we believe are relevant radio stations with smaller wattages and scattered in a network of confusion.

[01:05:09.120 --> 01:05:15.740]
And by the time they are rendered helpless, the collective will have already disposed the man for profit.

[01:05:16.340 --> 01:05:20.560]
Now grab that frying pan and repeat after us.

[01:05:21.180 --> 01:05:22.380]
We know what we're doing.

[01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:24.200]
We know what we're doing.

[01:05:24.620 --> 01:05:26.040]
We know what we're doing.

[01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:27.460]
Fuck you.

[01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:28.940]
Hi there boys and girls.

[01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:36.560]
Today we've been a very extra special friend, Stout and I, to show us all about something really special.

[01:05:37.780 --> 01:05:39.540]
I'm in the door right now.

[01:05:39.740 --> 01:05:41.160]
Come on in the sky, man.

[01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:43.500]
Arja, laddie.

[01:05:44.100 --> 01:05:46.340]
Hey, brought by something I wanted to show you.

[01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:48.080]
I wonder what it is.

[01:05:48.300 --> 01:05:49.960]
It looks like a...

[01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:50.340]
The pussy.

[01:05:51.380 --> 01:05:52.740]
It's my bag boy.

[01:05:53.260 --> 01:05:53.860]
What the bag?

[01:05:54.060 --> 01:05:54.360]
Hey.

[01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:55.200]
What?

[01:05:55.440 --> 01:05:56.120]
Can I touch it?

[01:05:56.400 --> 01:05:57.260]
Sure, go ahead.

[01:05:57.760 --> 01:05:58.920]
Run your hands, everybody.

[01:05:59.000 --> 01:05:59.960]
That's... that's...

[01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:00.960]
Hey, like...

[01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:03.720]
What's this right here?

[01:06:03.900 --> 01:06:05.220]
That is my ball pipe.

[01:06:05.220 --> 01:06:07.220]
What do you do with the blow pipe?

[01:06:07.460 --> 01:06:08.500]
You blow on it, laddie.

[01:06:08.620 --> 01:06:09.280]
You blow...

[01:06:09.940 --> 01:06:12.440]
Hey, you put your mouth around it and your blow.

[01:06:13.020 --> 01:06:14.040]
Oh, can I do that?

[01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:15.960]
Hey, would you like to blow my pipe, laddie?

[01:06:16.140 --> 01:06:16.940]
Oh, can I?

[01:06:17.240 --> 01:06:17.980]
Sure, go ahead.

[01:06:18.500 --> 01:06:18.700]
Okay.

[01:06:19.340 --> 01:06:20.120]
Come on laddie.

[01:06:20.500 --> 01:06:22.980]
You got to put your mouth around it, laddie.

[01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:23.660]
Don't be afraid.

[01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:24.500]
It's not going to break.

[01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:25.420]
Like this?

[01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:27.200]
Hey, that's a boy.

[01:06:27.700 --> 01:06:29.500]
Stick it on the way down yet through.

[01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:30.400]
It's bigger.

[01:06:30.660 --> 01:06:31.960]
Hey, it means you're doing it right.

[01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:34.100]
What's this over here?

[01:06:34.100 --> 01:06:35.140]
That's my chanter.

[01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:37.000]
What do I do with that?

[01:06:37.220 --> 01:06:40.680]
What you do with that, laddie, is you put your both hands on it,

[01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:44.980]
you cover the hole and you run your hands up and down the shaft real quick.

[01:06:45.780 --> 01:06:48.560]
Hey, you run your hands up and down it there.

[01:06:48.840 --> 01:06:51.980]
Now what you want to do, laddie, is you want to blow on the pipe,

[01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:56.020]
you want to squeeze the bag nice and gentle,

[01:06:56.620 --> 01:06:59.400]
and then you want to run your hands up into the shaft real quick.

[01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:00.600]

[01:07:00.900 --> 01:07:02.420]
All together, all at the same time.

[01:07:02.420 --> 01:07:03.700]
Okay, here we go.

[01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:04.640]
Good laddie.

[01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:06.500]
Hey, let's squeeze that.

[01:07:07.160 --> 01:07:07.640]
Sure.

[01:07:08.240 --> 01:07:09.000]
There's good laddie.

[01:07:09.780 --> 01:07:10.320]
Keep blowing.

[01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:11.760]
No harder laddie.

[01:07:12.220 --> 01:07:12.600]
Harder.

[01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:14.140]
Squeeze the bag.

[01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:15.220]
Squeeze more.

[01:07:15.740 --> 01:07:17.080]
Run your hands up and down the shaft.

[01:07:17.540 --> 01:07:18.320]
You picked faster.

[01:07:18.740 --> 01:07:19.820]
Run your hands up and down the shaft.

[01:07:20.060 --> 01:07:20.440]
Keep blowing.

[01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:21.480]
Keep blowing.

[01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:21.840]
Oh, no.

[01:07:23.420 --> 01:07:24.600]
You're doing it, laddie.

[01:07:24.780 --> 01:07:25.220]
I'm a pilot.

[01:07:25.740 --> 01:07:26.360]
Oh, no.

[01:07:26.840 --> 01:07:27.640]
Oh, no.

[01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:28.540]
Oh, no.

[01:07:28.540 --> 01:07:28.640]
Oh, no.

[01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:28.860]
Oh, no.

[01:07:29.780 --> 01:07:30.800]
Oh, no.

[01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:31.420]
Oh, no.

[01:07:31.420 --> 01:07:31.740]
What's that?

[01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:33.100]
You can do that again.

[01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:37.080]
I have to look at you, but I've been listening WQM for,

[01:07:37.220 --> 01:07:42.000]
I've got five to six years, and I've watched the morning show,

[01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:44.900]
evolving everything, and I have a problem.

[01:07:44.980 --> 01:07:48.380]
I'm taking my kids to school and these thinking commercials for,

[01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:53.460]
for the guy that curses nasty, nasty things,

[01:07:53.520 --> 01:07:54.640]
and there's no warning.

[01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:56.360]
It just blurt out, you know,

[01:07:56.680 --> 01:08:00.020]
f*** you, and you can hear the bleep,

[01:08:00.120 --> 01:08:01.640]
you can hear the f***, you know,

[01:08:01.840 --> 01:08:03.720]
and you can hear the venom in his voice,

[01:08:04.020 --> 01:08:08.120]
and you know, I don't have a chance to turn off my radio quick enough.

[01:08:08.500 --> 01:08:10.940]
Now, I heard it, you know, I had a problem again the other day.

[01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:13.100]
I can't explain that stuff to my kids.

[01:08:13.480 --> 01:08:16.100]
I've been listening to this station for a long time,

[01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:20.180]
and I think you're ruining it by infiltrating it with his nasty language.

[01:08:21.240 --> 01:08:22.880]
And I don't know what I can do,

[01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:26.480]
but I just thought I'd better call, you know, and tell you,

[01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:27.620]
it's different with Hank.

[01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:29.540]
If Hank calls someone in son of a bitch,

[01:08:29.540 --> 01:08:32.420]
he just heard the guy act like a son of a bitch,

[01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:34.220]
and there's a reason for it.

[01:08:34.280 --> 01:08:37.540]
But the other guy with his fart and his asshole

[01:08:37.540 --> 01:08:39.660]
and just the way he curses,

[01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:42.000]
he's ruining your first team.

[01:08:42.660 --> 01:08:48.540]
And I think Joe Roach had stand up and get this off,

[01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:50.140]
kick off his program,

[01:08:50.140 --> 01:08:56.240]
because there's a lot of people like me that have children,

[01:08:56.920 --> 01:08:58.700]
and I just don't like to hear someone say,

[01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:00.680]
pissed off on my way to work.

[01:09:01.340 --> 01:09:04.220]
Pissed off gets me fired up when I hear someone say that,

[01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:06.320]
and I don't think it's appropriate.

[01:09:07.140 --> 01:09:09.460]
You know, if you're going to have to enance a little program

[01:09:09.460 --> 01:09:11.520]
in the middle of your day, leave it there.

[01:09:11.860 --> 01:09:13.140]
To make the other programs,

[01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:15.480]
it's demeaned us,

[01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:17.560]
and it really insults my intelligence,

[01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:19.560]
and you know, that's not clear.

[01:09:19.700 --> 01:09:20.280]
I don't know what it is.

[01:09:20.400 --> 01:09:21.080]
I'll talk to you later.

[01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:23.980]
This is Debbie.

[01:09:24.300 --> 01:09:24.900]
Oh, hi, Debbie.

[01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:27.580]
I'm interested in getting some operations done.

[01:09:28.040 --> 01:09:28.380]
Okay.

[01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:30.680]
And some body contouring and some liposuction.

[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:31.300]
Mm-hmm.

[01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:33.480]
And I was wondering if you get some tummy talk,

[01:09:34.100 --> 01:09:36.720]
and the lip augmentation cosmetic breast surgery

[01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:38.520]
faced all of these things.

[01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:39.100]
Mm-hmm.

[01:09:39.400 --> 01:09:40.680]
And those wondering...

[01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:41.480]
What are you like to start with?

[01:09:41.820 --> 01:09:43.980]
Well, I need to get everything done.

[01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:46.080]
Probably the first thing I'd like to have removed

[01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:48.480]
is my thing.

[01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:50.000]
Okay, we don't do that.

[01:09:50.300 --> 01:09:52.360]
No. Could you do breast implants, though?

[01:09:52.780 --> 01:09:54.460]
Uh, it can't be done,

[01:09:54.600 --> 01:09:55.940]
but I don't know what they would do right away.

[01:09:56.040 --> 01:09:57.920]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[01:09:58.420 --> 01:09:58.780]
Mm-hmm.

[01:09:59.140 --> 01:10:00.060]
How much?

[01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:01.580]
Uh, 5,000.

[01:10:01.980 --> 01:10:02.320]
Excellent.

[01:10:02.740 --> 01:10:04.760]
I'd like to have my skin resurfaced, too.

[01:10:05.100 --> 01:10:05.440]
Uh-huh.

[01:10:05.540 --> 01:10:06.480]
And there's the surgery.

[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:07.320]
Uh-huh.

[01:10:07.680 --> 01:10:10.480]
Have the lamb stop crying yet, mommy?

[01:10:11.180 --> 01:10:11.740]
Excuse me?

[01:10:12.140 --> 01:10:13.660]
Don't hurt mommy's little baby.

[01:10:13.660 --> 01:10:16.180]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:19.940]
I'd like to get the liposuction that I saw on TV.

[01:10:20.540 --> 01:10:20.840]
Okay.

[01:10:21.260 --> 01:10:23.100]
Can you make me look more like a woman?

[01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:24.600]
Well, we'll have to see you first

[01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:25.780]
in the upon looking at you.

[01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:27.060]
We can tell you that when we see you.

[01:10:27.480 --> 01:10:29.300]
Should I wear my skin suit,

[01:10:29.480 --> 01:10:31.100]
made of body parts, mommy?

[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:32.900]
Uh, if you'd like to.

[01:10:33.340 --> 01:10:35.160]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[01:10:35.620 --> 01:10:36.500]
Would you like to make an appointment?

[01:10:37.220 --> 01:10:37.660]
Yes.

[01:10:38.140 --> 01:10:38.480]
Okay.

[01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:41.300]
Um, there is a $100 consultation fee.

[01:10:41.660 --> 01:10:42.200]
That's fine.

[01:10:43.900 --> 01:10:44.300]
Okay.

[01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:49.060]
Um, my name is Buffalo Bill.

[01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:49.720]
Okay.

[01:10:49.820 --> 01:10:51.040]
Let me get a little information from you.

[01:10:51.140 --> 01:10:51.320]
Okay.

[01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:54.500]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[01:10:54.920 --> 01:10:55.620]
I understand.

[01:10:56.060 --> 01:10:58.060]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[01:10:58.580 --> 01:11:00.480]
Do you want to come in for a consultation?

[01:11:00.820 --> 01:11:04.260]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[01:11:04.940 --> 01:11:05.340]
Okay.

[01:11:06.280 --> 01:11:07.480]
Would you like to make an appointment?

[01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:08.460]
Or do you want to call me back?

[01:11:08.620 --> 01:11:10.520]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:12.880]
I got my skin suit and it's like,

[01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:13.640]
I feel like, uh,

[01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:15.240]
Bill.

[01:11:15.900 --> 01:11:17.960]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[01:11:18.460 --> 01:11:19.260]
I understand that.

[01:11:19.340 --> 01:11:19.660]
Would you like to?

[01:11:19.900 --> 01:11:21.840]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[01:11:22.440 --> 01:11:23.480]
Would you like to make an appointment?

[01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:25.520]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:26.340]
Okay.

[01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:27.240]
I will talk to you in the time.

[01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:27.600]
Okay?

[01:11:27.900 --> 01:11:29.540]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[01:11:29.900 --> 01:11:30.340]
Hello?

[01:11:32.220 --> 01:11:34.420]
They say I love his tapoo.

[01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:38.360]
That what we're doing is wrong.

[01:11:39.700 --> 01:11:42.800]
But I don't care what they say.

[01:11:43.580 --> 01:11:46.140]
Because my love is so strong.

[01:11:47.420 --> 01:11:50.140]
They tell us we should be ashamed.

[01:11:51.520 --> 01:11:53.700]
We're not husband and wife.

[01:11:55.300 --> 01:11:58.020]
But I cherish each moment with you.

[01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:02.160]
I'm so glad you're in my life.

[01:12:13.180 --> 01:12:14.980]
You're my prison bitch.

[01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:16.340]
My prison bitch.

[01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:18.720]
You're not a light of the men.

[01:12:19.220 --> 01:12:21.920]
I'm glad we share a prison cell.

[01:12:22.360 --> 01:12:24.440]
We're lights go out at 10.

[01:12:25.060 --> 01:12:27.440]
I can't accept who I feel.

[01:12:27.800 --> 01:12:29.980]
Now that wouldn't be a crime.

[01:12:30.560 --> 01:12:32.140]
As long as I'm in my life,

[01:12:32.140 --> 01:12:32.140]

[01:12:32.140 --> 01:12:32.140]

[01:12:32.140 --> 01:12:32.920]
I'm doing you.

[01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:35.420]
I don't mind doing time.

[01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:39.740]
Cause you're my prison bitch.

[01:12:40.260 --> 01:12:41.260]
My prison bitch.

[01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:43.440]
And I have no regrets.

[01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:49.000]
I got you for a candy bar and a pack of cigarettes.

[01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:51.800]
At first you were resistant.

[01:12:52.700 --> 01:12:54.840]
But now you are my friend.

[01:12:55.460 --> 01:12:59.100]
I knew that I would give you in the end.

[01:12:59.100 --> 01:13:02.260]
Oh, prison bitch.

[01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:09.600]
I guess that you were sick from a football.

[01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:13.340]
Prison bitch.

[01:13:14.620 --> 01:13:16.060]
Prison bitch.

[01:13:16.820 --> 01:13:19.640]
And now you are my prisoner.

[01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:24.080]
I'm your prison bitch.

[01:13:24.520 --> 01:13:25.500]
Your prison bitch.

[01:13:25.880 --> 01:13:27.520]
And you're a sex machine.

[01:13:27.520 --> 01:13:30.840]
I only have one request.

[01:13:31.400 --> 01:13:33.040]
How about some Vaseline?

[01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:33.640]
Sure.

[01:13:34.180 --> 01:13:36.500]
I'm tired of this prison cell.

[01:13:36.980 --> 01:13:38.900]
I need to get away.

[01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:42.100]
My sentence made you seven years.

[01:13:42.460 --> 01:13:44.560]
Now seven times a day.

[01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:46.160]
I'm your prison bitch.

[01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:47.520]
Your prison bitch.

[01:13:47.960 --> 01:13:48.400]
You're not a human.

[01:13:50.520 --> 01:13:52.820]
I really hate these markers.

[01:13:53.300 --> 01:13:54.900]
That you don't know.

[01:13:54.900 --> 01:13:55.020]
I'm a cop.

[01:13:55.900 --> 01:13:58.820]
I thought that I could break away.

[01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:01.160]
But now I'm losing hope.

[01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:05.040]
But I'm part of a pin of love so.

[01:14:05.580 --> 01:14:08.620]
And now the prison bitch.

[01:14:10.260 --> 01:14:11.420]
Prison bitch.

[01:14:12.900 --> 01:14:17.080]
Burn out the lights cause I can hardly wait.

[01:14:18.900 --> 01:14:19.700]
Prison bitch.

[01:14:19.700 --> 01:14:20.980]
You're made in one way.

[01:14:21.220 --> 01:14:22.440]
Prison bitch.

[01:14:22.620 --> 01:14:25.940]
And when I get out, I'm ready.

[01:14:26.380 --> 01:14:27.240]
You go straight.

[01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:30.380]
You're my prison bitch.

[01:14:30.820 --> 01:14:31.780]
My prison bitch.

[01:14:32.300 --> 01:14:34.260]
I'll never say goodbye.

[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.320]
You're not like all the others.

[01:14:37.900 --> 01:14:40.440]
Too bad they had to die.

[01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:44.700]
On the second thought I've lived outstack.

[01:14:45.220 --> 01:14:47.120]
If you want me to.

[01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:49.760]
Your prison bitch.

[01:14:50.220 --> 01:14:55.720]
Is never leaving you.

[01:14:58.860 --> 01:15:00.720]
That person would not sell me.

[01:15:01.060 --> 01:15:02.260]
But now you're my soulmate.

[01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:03.200]
That's so perfect.

[01:15:03.780 --> 01:15:05.440]
I know, not again.

[01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:07.580]
Now I know what they call you.

[01:15:07.860 --> 01:15:09.020]
Heart criminal.

[01:15:09.720 --> 01:15:11.800]
You're about to find out what you call this.

[01:15:12.140 --> 01:15:12.740]
The polka.

[01:15:16.140 --> 01:15:17.180]
Oh.

[01:15:18.560 --> 01:15:18.780]
Oh.

[01:15:19.160 --> 01:15:20.180]
Oh.

[01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:22.320]

[01:15:23.540 --> 01:15:23.540]

[01:15:23.680 --> 01:15:24.000]
Oh.

[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:24.360]
Oh.

[01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:30.720]
And the leader.

[01:15:31.240 --> 01:15:32.200]
And the leader.

[01:15:32.760 --> 01:15:32.920]
And the leader.

[01:15:32.920 --> 01:15:34.420]
She's from the movie.

[01:15:35.420 --> 01:15:41.200]
With your fucking yellow teeth so far apart.

[01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:47.380]
Candle-eat-the-candle-eat-the-what you be doing.

[01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:53.620]
Just the old-fashioned black-ed-token schwarzer-thong.

[01:15:55.060 --> 01:16:00.320]
Is you think, cause you are at home, bootly-flipply-thong?

[01:16:01.320 --> 01:16:06.960]
Is you deflacte and jam-nam-e-kobi-smart?

[01:16:07.900 --> 01:16:09.380]
Does they lack?

[01:16:10.140 --> 01:16:13.140]
Are you shunned, they're used to the leader?

[01:16:14.480 --> 01:16:19.500]
Oh, the way you watch and talk, the white is cause.

[01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:25.560]
Georgia, Jr., say he trust you, unbelievable.

[01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:32.300]
Who tell our allies on the greedy oil wall?

[01:16:34.040 --> 01:16:39.100]
But then he make you clean all the white house bathrooms.

[01:16:40.620 --> 01:16:45.300]
The cup of sea, the toilet, and then scrub the floor.

[01:16:46.940 --> 01:16:51.800]
They tell you no where's the door, not the leader.

[01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:58.400]
Your phone keeps on helping make them all a wretch and you.

[01:16:59.740 --> 01:17:05.200]
Your nape-legger, look you slide, it's bevel-throw.

[01:17:06.700 --> 01:17:11.640]
The GOP want you to be that talk is true.

[01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:18.200]
One day while you be flippin' back, you may realize

[01:17:19.600 --> 01:17:24.600]
That's the dream you just like your esterone.

[01:17:25.700 --> 01:17:31.460]
That's when your head will move from side to side, drunkenly low.

[01:17:32.500 --> 01:17:37.580]
Until push and rummage, they be crackin' at home.

[01:17:40.460 --> 01:17:44.920]
Oh, don't make me angry, oh, go away, look what I got mine.

[01:17:45.920 --> 01:17:49.400]
My baby's a turtle, look at the noise.

[01:17:51.920 --> 01:18:00.020]
Hit my baby far, will you buy more of my records?

[01:18:02.420 --> 01:18:07.140]
What is there at all?

[01:18:07.960 --> 01:18:11.540]
Do some more of my records?

[01:18:12.820 --> 01:18:17.200]
Oh, my face is still rolling.

[01:18:19.900 --> 01:18:23.200]
Cause you take it, sell it, talk down.

[01:18:23.560 --> 01:18:27.700]
I'll drop this baby on the ground.

[01:18:28.700 --> 01:18:31.140]
Do sell records.

[01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:38.140]
Oh no, I'm losing my grip.

[01:18:41.700 --> 01:18:44.340]
The baby dangles the ground.

[01:18:47.700 --> 01:18:55.640]
As I hold it at the window, I can feel your crowd.

[01:18:58.260 --> 01:19:02.840]
Dangling the baby at the window.

[01:19:04.700 --> 01:19:08.420]
I'm a pair of bar, as you know.

[01:19:09.360 --> 01:19:18.220]
And I might just let it go, cause it's way too young to school.

[01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:21.040]
My my records.

[01:19:22.620 --> 01:19:24.100]
Look, it's dangling.

[01:19:25.740 --> 01:19:27.000]
My my records.

[01:19:27.420 --> 01:19:28.160]
Oh my face.

[01:19:28.640 --> 01:19:29.900]
Around your office, baby.

[01:19:30.720 --> 01:19:32.000]
But I'm your hand.

[01:19:45.380 --> 01:19:47.920]
I took your calls from the ebonyx.

[01:19:48.900 --> 01:19:51.020]
They say the putabee's rat furl me.

[01:19:51.020 --> 01:19:53.320]
Now I can't get no job.

[01:19:53.660 --> 01:19:55.980]
Cause I don't got no literacy.

[01:19:56.980 --> 01:19:58.740]
I's talking like an old Negro.

[01:19:59.620 --> 01:20:01.840]
Ebonyx thought they how this way.

[01:20:02.400 --> 01:20:04.000]
Now I can't do nothing.

[01:20:04.700 --> 01:20:07.000]
But my hair is it say that's okay.

[01:20:07.740 --> 01:20:09.620]
Change my name to shoot, roll.

[01:20:10.080 --> 01:20:12.640]
Drive a doos and a quarter and a Cadillac.

[01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:20.540]
I remember when I was feeling all the white man's cars.

[01:20:20.540 --> 01:20:23.100]
Hanging outside, developing their bar.

[01:20:23.440 --> 01:20:25.420]
Grind the blues, my poverty.

[01:20:26.200 --> 01:20:28.360]
White devil's got no job for me.

[01:20:28.700 --> 01:20:33.280]

[01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:03.540]
Got nothing to do with literacy.

[01:21:04.440 --> 01:21:05.960]

[01:21:12.120 --> 01:21:14.240]
Ebonyx ain't getting me anywhere.

[01:21:14.860 --> 01:21:16.780]
Maybe I'll mug an old white bitch.

[01:21:17.440 --> 01:21:19.540]
Steal a purse and pull her hair.

[01:21:19.540 --> 01:21:21.760]
Then I gonna take her money.

[01:21:22.180 --> 01:21:25.000]
My cereal and the fridge are dead.

[01:21:28.420 --> 01:21:32.780]
I remember when I was feeling all the white man's cars.

[01:21:33.260 --> 01:21:35.360]
Hanging outside, developing their bar.

[01:21:35.700 --> 01:21:37.660]
Grind the blues, my poverty.

[01:21:38.240 --> 01:21:40.520]

You know what we're thinking we drive into our team

[01:23:09.920 --> 01:23:14.120]

You cut it away quite liberally

[01:25:45.840 --> 01:25:47.520]
When I was circumcised

[01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:49.820]
Somehow a glue back on me

My force gets back after hanging like a fruit fly

[01:25:56.840 --> 01:26:00.260]
All day, all day my force gets back

[01:26:00.260 --> 01:26:02.920]

And then we wrap our company down the size

[01:26:18.680 --> 01:26:23.180]

This is Dwayne's stump of Black Tooth

[01:27:15.320 --> 01:27:18.940]
Telling you, if you do drugs this weekend, don't drive

[01:27:18.940 --> 01:27:23.520]
Wrong again, Dwayne, it's don't do drugs, don't do drugs

[01:27:23.520 --> 01:27:24.540]
That's what I said

[01:27:24.540 --> 01:27:26.720]
No, it's not, it's not even close to what you said

[01:27:26.720 --> 01:27:29.760]
You coming this booth, I'll show you how close it was, Sherlock

[01:27:31.560 --> 01:27:34.420]
We're gonna do it again, Dwayne

[01:27:34.940 --> 01:27:36.800]

Weekends are for drugs, do drugs

[01:27:50.100 --> 01:27:52.820]
Okay Dwayne, thank you very much for coming in

[01:27:52.820 --> 01:27:55.900]
I think with a little editing, we've got something we can use

[01:27:55.900 --> 01:28:01.200]
Don't do drugs, and if you must drink this holiday, we can do not drive

[01:28:02.500 --> 01:28:06.500]
The Pope is coming and going on George Duke

What the hell are you doing to me?

[01:30:23.920 --> 01:30:25.160]
What do you mean, sir?

[01:30:25.420 --> 01:30:26.820]
Why am I reading in the paper?

[01:30:26.820 --> 01:30:29.360]
You're gonna put a Disney theme park in Brooklyn?

[01:30:29.840 --> 01:30:31.660]
Well, sir, we're just scouting locations

[01:30:31.660 --> 01:30:35.700]

What's underneath Butt Munch? Don't tell me to calm down!

[01:31:07.380 --> 01:31:08.820]
We got lucky with lead row instead

[01:31:08.820 --> 01:31:10.040]
It's $128 million!

[01:31:10.640 --> 01:31:13.020]
Now, you're trying to ruin my whole network!

[01:31:13.300 --> 01:31:15.160]
What kind of programming are you running?

[01:31:15.260 --> 01:31:16.860]
I'm in my way

[01:31:16.860 --> 01:31:17.780]
Hang on a minute

[01:31:19.400 --> 01:31:20.000]

And head off the module, waiter!

[01:31:30.800 --> 01:31:31.640]
Okay, boss

[01:31:31.640 --> 01:31:33.180]
Good God!

[01:31:33.560 --> 01:31:35.480]
Sir, the network is fine

[01:31:35.480 --> 01:31:37.320]
Why couldn't you come up with American Idol?

[01:31:37.320 --> 01:31:40.240]
Good God, you're still running James Bob movies!

[01:31:40.520 --> 01:31:42.000]
They're 60 years old!

[01:31:42.320 --> 01:31:45.160]
Why don't you just put steamboat willing on to be done with it?

[01:31:45.520 --> 01:31:47.660]
Please don't, I'd make a couple of damn dollars!

[01:31:48.380 --> 01:31:50.400]
Well, the movie division's fine

[01:31:50.400 --> 01:31:55.280]

[01:31:59.560 --> 01:32:02.260]
You got to start swinging some of these titles past me!

[01:32:09.060 --> 01:32:10.220]
It ain't even Bob!

[01:32:10.720 --> 01:32:12.360]
I know you can't hear me!

[01:32:13.040 --> 01:32:13.080]

[01:32:13.480 --> 01:32:15.020]
Yes, sir! I'm on the bucket!

Here's a number of numbers!

[01:32:18.200 --> 01:32:19.360]
Get on it, Raymond!

[01:32:19.540 --> 01:32:21.240]
To take that blue bird with you!

[01:32:21.580 --> 01:32:22.900]
All right!

[01:32:23.380 --> 01:32:25.040]
I said, yes sir!

[01:32:25.100 --> 01:32:27.620]
I'd be very careful the next time I started my car!

[01:32:27.800 --> 01:32:28.260]
Why were you?

[01:32:28.460 --> 01:32:29.600]
What do you mean, sir?

[01:32:29.600 --> 01:32:30.460]
I'm not done with you!

[01:32:30.680 --> 01:32:30.820]
What?

[01:32:31.060 --> 01:32:31.660]
I'm not done!

[01:32:31.660 --> 01:32:34.220]
Sir, I'll put him in your job!

[01:32:34.560 --> 01:32:36.100]
But sir, you're terrible!

[01:32:36.440 --> 01:32:36.740]
I'm sorry!

[01:32:37.020 --> 01:32:38.500]
Baby, I put remits in there!

[01:32:38.880 --> 01:32:41.100]
I don't want to be president of Disney Remus!

[01:32:41.560 --> 01:32:42.500]
Oh, man!

[01:32:42.900 --> 01:32:44.240]
What a wonderful day!

[01:32:44.720 --> 01:32:46.100]

Cause I love what you do!

[01:33:04.220 --> 01:33:05.940]
Kind of wish that I was you!

[01:33:06.160 --> 01:33:07.900]
Just a little more of C!

[01:33:11.200 --> 01:33:18.240]
Prickly, prickly, prickly, prickly, prickly, prickly, prickly, prickly, prickly, prickly, prickly!

[01:33:18.800 --> 01:33:23.080]
Prickly, I wear your t-shirt as my 90!

[01:33:26.640 --> 01:33:31.320]
Prickly, I like to have you on my body!

[01:33:33.660 --> 01:33:37.880]
When it comes to any day, there's no way you're gonna win

[01:33:37.880 --> 01:33:40.460]
Or best theme of performance!

[01:33:41.800 --> 01:33:45.840]
I've been doing this so long in the time you had your day

[01:33:45.840 --> 01:33:49.940]
Even though I love your song, you best stay out of my way!

[01:33:49.940 --> 01:33:56.700]
With me, you know that I think you're a hot-y, yeah!

[01:33:58.080 --> 01:34:03.200]
With me, love when you strip down, show your body!

[01:34:10.880 --> 01:34:12.140]
Hey, push!

[01:34:14.700 --> 01:34:16.060]
Hey, push!

[01:34:18.900 --> 01:34:22.940]
I stumble and I fumble just to talk is really hard

[01:34:22.940 --> 01:34:26.960]
Without pre-written notes from Power over Andrew Cardi!

[01:34:27.060 --> 01:34:27.700]
Hey, push!

[01:34:29.160 --> 01:34:30.880]
My brain is made of dudeo!

[01:34:30.980 --> 01:34:31.600]
Hey, push!

[01:34:32.460 --> 01:34:34.840]
But that don't seem to bug you!

[01:34:35.240 --> 01:34:38.560]
I have no opposition and you have no opinion!

[01:34:39.280 --> 01:34:39.440]
Hey, push!

[01:34:40.100 --> 01:34:41.500]
This pose is pretty high!

[01:34:42.560 --> 01:34:46.500]
Come out, rage by the shudden wave of white collar crime!

[01:34:46.820 --> 01:34:50.240]
Unless, of course, the CEO's her old friends of mine!

[01:34:50.480 --> 01:34:51.140]
Hey, push!

[01:34:52.320 --> 01:34:54.040]
That's as little as I'm a girl!

[01:34:54.400 --> 01:34:55.100]
Hey, push!

[01:34:55.520 --> 01:34:57.700]
That Harry Blasher, he's a homo!

[01:34:58.100 --> 01:35:02.920]
The Saudis they attacked us, but who don't give a crap its team push?

[01:35:03.320 --> 01:35:04.580]
Just an era of friends!

[01:35:06.400 --> 01:35:09.840]
Hester shirt were in pursuit of evil jurors every day!

[01:35:09.840 --> 01:35:13.540]
Just like those drug lords being pursued by OJ!

[01:35:15.380 --> 01:35:17.320]
You don't care what I'm doing!

[01:35:17.820 --> 01:35:18.480]
Team push!

[01:35:19.680 --> 01:35:21.500]
And I thought I was stupid!

[01:35:22.080 --> 01:35:23.900]
The media controls you!

[01:35:24.400 --> 01:35:26.320]
You do what you told the team push!

[01:35:26.780 --> 01:35:28.580]
If you didn't see it on TV it ain't true!

[01:35:29.540 --> 01:35:33.340]
The media isn't our control with stories they're a spinning!

[01:35:33.680 --> 01:35:36.820]
No matter what goes wrong, it will just blame it all on Clinton!

[01:35:36.820 --> 01:35:38.040]
Team push!

[01:35:38.800 --> 01:35:41.100]
I don't have no interest going down!

[01:35:41.720 --> 01:35:45.200]
I'm on a higher ball ground, because I can't wouldn't know how!

[01:35:45.580 --> 01:35:49.700]
He's a moral brother and a bug founder, Team push!

[01:35:51.460 --> 01:35:53.160]
I'm not a baby!

[01:35:56.600 --> 01:35:58.360]
I'm not a baby!

[01:36:01.740 --> 01:36:03.520]
I'm not a baby!

[01:36:03.520 --> 01:36:07.640]
The way does look at me, is obscene!

[01:36:08.640 --> 01:36:11.420]
Not till they bet your glad!

[01:36:12.360 --> 01:36:13.800]
I'm not a baby!

[01:36:14.340 --> 01:36:17.060]
I finally turned 18!

[01:36:19.340 --> 01:36:22.200]
And I'm scantily clad, yeah!

[01:36:22.540 --> 01:36:23.360]
Oh, me!

[01:36:23.820 --> 01:36:26.280]
All you want to do with me!

[01:36:26.720 --> 01:36:28.380]
Not a baby!

[01:36:28.380 --> 01:36:34.580]
I thought I'm really hot, well, it's because I'm not sit here!

[01:36:35.120 --> 01:36:37.960]
I used to be and there!

[01:36:38.300 --> 01:36:42.040]
This schoolgirl dressed way above my knees!

[01:36:42.200 --> 01:36:43.300]
Above my knees!

[01:36:43.460 --> 01:36:50.600]
When you think of what you do to me, remember that I'm!

[01:36:50.720 --> 01:36:53.280]
Legal baby, that's no crime!

[01:37:00.400 --> 01:37:04.680]
Sister G, the dance machine, a sweet and none-with-happy beat!

[01:37:05.140 --> 01:37:06.820]
Jump the gyre into the beat!

[01:37:07.360 --> 01:37:11.420]
Sister G, the dance machine, sister G, is eccellency!

[01:37:11.980 --> 01:37:16.080]
Laddy Catholic, Dr. Reign, forward out, we're way too late!

[01:37:16.560 --> 01:37:18.360]
She can shake that tasty beat!

[01:37:18.860 --> 01:37:22.660]
She's quite a side of life and might look like a real cool dance in the pool!

[01:37:23.320 --> 01:37:25.340]
Look at her go, swinging high and low!

[01:37:25.340 --> 01:37:27.540]
She's a legal boy, very model-o-two!

[01:37:28.160 --> 01:37:32.320]
Sister G, the dance machine, a dance machine, a perfect only thing!

[01:37:32.760 --> 01:37:36.820]
She'll knock you off your feet, when you hear her well and sit!

[01:37:37.240 --> 01:37:41.020]
I got a bad habit of jumping like a rabbit when the music turned me on!

[01:37:41.660 --> 01:37:46.460]
I know it sounds happy, but I'm so goddamn happy that you didn't hit his gawd!

[01:37:46.720 --> 01:37:49.540]
Sister G, the sweet and none-with-happy beat!

[01:37:49.880 --> 01:37:50.780]
A shaken bouncing tone of fun!

[01:37:50.780 --> 01:37:55.480]
Dying bad for 85, then that none-with-happy beat!

[01:37:56.260 --> 01:38:01.180]
Sister G, the dance machine, sister G, the dance machine, sister G!

[01:38:01.300 --> 01:38:04.540]
Sister G, the dance machine, sister G!

[01:38:06.080 --> 01:38:07.300]
Sister G, the dance machine, sister G!

[01:38:07.760 --> 01:38:08.080]
The dance machine, sister G!

[01:38:08.280 --> 01:38:09.120]
Sister G, sister G!

[01:38:09.540 --> 01:38:12.460]
Sister G, the dance machine, sister G!

[01:38:12.460 --> 01:38:16.660]
All the dance machines, all the dance machines, all the dance machines!

[01:38:16.660 --> 01:38:23.060]
All the dance machines, all the dance machines, all the dance machines!

[01:38:31.200 --> 01:38:34.280]
My wife took their card or the mall!

[01:38:35.400 --> 01:38:38.760]
She drives my viewer again, she's three feet tall!

[01:38:40.140 --> 01:38:43.040]
I wouldn't ride with her no way!

[01:38:44.040 --> 01:38:47.520]
I said I'd need it and I laid it again!

[01:38:48.320 --> 01:38:52.340]
So I'm just sitting on a bench in the rain

[01:38:53.040 --> 01:38:56.780]
Waiting for the early first to take me away

[01:38:56.780 --> 01:39:03.900]
I'm just sitting on a bench in the rain with my friend's time!

[01:39:08.300 --> 01:39:11.940]
Looks like it's time to check my change!

[01:39:12.940 --> 01:39:16.020]
Christ of my stands don't always stay the same!

[01:39:16.720 --> 01:39:20.420]
All that God will do what Yeta tells me to do!

[01:39:21.200 --> 01:39:24.620]
The private high-rides, she must be in a stand!

[01:39:25.500 --> 01:39:28.480]
Just sitting here and resting my bones!

[01:39:29.480 --> 01:39:32.460]
Wondering why my wife won't leave me alone!

[01:39:33.540 --> 01:39:36.860]
We've talked it over and I never went!

[01:39:37.880 --> 01:39:42.020]
I just wind up schlepping through the mall again!

[01:39:42.060 --> 01:39:45.900]
Oi, so I sit on a bench in the rain

[01:39:46.740 --> 01:39:50.500]
Waiting for the early first to take me away

[01:39:50.500 --> 01:39:58.700]
Oi, I'm just sitting on a bench in the rain with my friend's time!

[01:39:59.880 --> 01:40:01.860]
There he is!

[01:40:01.860 --> 01:40:05.320]
To have damn time I've been waiting here all day in this rain!

[01:40:05.560 --> 01:40:11.460]
I will only go and stop trying to smoke!

[01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:19.380]
Welcome back to the glittering pageantry of the Mojáudé de David'a Show!

[01:40:19.700 --> 01:40:21.100]
We have a full ducket today!

[01:40:21.880 --> 01:40:25.520]
Including the cavalcade of our articulate athlete of yours!

[01:40:26.120 --> 01:40:27.960]
You know that pipe smoke is still at it!

[01:40:30.960 --> 01:40:31.560]
What?!

[01:40:31.560 --> 01:40:33.380]
They make fun of me all the time!

[01:40:34.840 --> 01:40:36.500]
Why they don't adore me?

[01:40:36.500 --> 01:40:38.680]
They're there, everything will be alright Mo!

[01:40:39.420 --> 01:40:40.800]
Get your hands off me, a fairy!

[01:40:41.080 --> 01:40:41.540]
You're queer!

[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:42.920]
You're a tomb chumper!

[01:40:43.220 --> 01:40:45.780]
Real men don't touch only during the game!

[01:40:46.060 --> 01:40:46.780]
Yes, Master!

[01:40:46.920 --> 01:40:47.620]
They want singing!

[01:40:48.120 --> 01:40:49.200]
I'll give them singing!

[01:40:49.560 --> 01:40:50.280]
Get on a piano!

[01:40:50.740 --> 01:40:51.080]
Over there!

[01:40:51.360 --> 01:40:51.820]
Ok, Mo!

[01:40:52.060 --> 01:40:53.280]
Now, hit it!

[01:40:54.420 --> 01:40:57.380]
Back in my day, men were straight!

[01:40:58.380 --> 01:41:01.060]
The end day is not today!

[01:41:02.220 --> 01:41:04.620]
That's why I can't tolerate!

[01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.420]
Just got slid days!

[01:41:09.280 --> 01:41:12.520]
Spoils were in day by day!

[01:41:28.800 --> 01:41:29.280]
Stop it!

[01:41:29.400 --> 01:41:30.400]
Stop it! You're more on!

[01:41:30.580 --> 01:41:31.340]
What's the matter, Mo?

[01:41:31.600 --> 01:41:32.720]
My wig fell off again!

[01:41:33.380 --> 01:41:35.260]
Ok, alright, where were we?

[01:41:35.640 --> 01:41:37.780]
Spoils were in day by day!

[01:41:37.960 --> 01:41:39.160]
Ah, take it from here!

[01:41:39.660 --> 01:41:42.420]
The guys that like to worship men!

[01:41:43.860 --> 01:41:46.220]
Clicking we will see full indoor!

[01:41:46.600 --> 01:41:48.240]
We live in the middle of the game!

[01:41:50.340 --> 01:41:53.560]
Didn't mean to soothbrush daydance!

[01:41:53.560 --> 01:41:57.240]
Or to tickle hair retained!

[01:41:58.300 --> 01:42:01.200]
Jesus Christ, I really hate!

[01:42:02.920 --> 01:42:06.320]
Jesus, God's Lynn Gai!

[01:42:09.640 --> 01:42:10.740]
Hi, Felicia!

[01:42:11.120 --> 01:42:12.420]
Gee, I love your dress!

[01:42:12.740 --> 01:42:14.720]
And your hair looks so shiny and manageable!

[01:42:15.140 --> 01:42:17.480]
Are you still shampooing with head and shoulders?

[01:42:17.960 --> 01:42:18.880]
Gosh, chick!

[01:42:19.160 --> 01:42:21.560]
I stopped using head and shoulders a long time ago!

[01:42:21.560 --> 01:42:24.680]
I mean, honestly, who grows hair on their shoulders anyway?

[01:42:25.120 --> 01:42:25.880]
Yeah, right.

[01:42:26.260 --> 01:42:27.780]
So, what are you using now?

[01:42:28.380 --> 01:42:31.520]
Well, it's like head and shoulders only without all those additives!

[01:42:31.940 --> 01:42:33.160]
It's just called head!

[01:42:33.700 --> 01:42:34.940]
Let's tell him about it, girls!

[01:42:35.980 --> 01:42:39.720]
If you're tired of the ocean, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

[01:42:39.720 --> 01:42:42.680]
Reveal fairness and feeling through, yeah, yeah!

[01:42:42.840 --> 01:42:45.920]
Just remember what I've said, yeah, yeah!

[01:42:45.960 --> 01:42:48.180]
You feel better if you get some head!

[01:42:48.400 --> 01:42:50.660]
Wow, where can I get head?

[01:42:50.660 --> 01:42:55.840]
Lots of places, Chick. You can stop by my place later and I'll be happy to give you some

[01:42:55.840 --> 01:43:00.620]
head in 50 minutes. I'll have you shampooed, styled, and blown dry.

[01:43:00.920 --> 01:43:05.240]
You don't miss a lick, do you? Head sound great, but is it expensive?

[01:43:05.780 --> 01:43:11.400]
Not at all, Chick. My brother says there are places downtown where you can get head for less than $10.

[01:43:12.040 --> 01:43:18.380]
Golly, at that price, everyone should be getting head. That's right, Chick. When you say head, you set a mouthful.

[01:43:18.380 --> 01:43:23.480]
Hi, I'm Dr. Raymond Falotti from Freedom Island Industries, here to kill you. Why you should get head?

[01:43:24.020 --> 01:43:28.920]
First, it lubricates each limp hair follicle, leaving in a wreck, listening shaft. Then the scalp's

[01:43:28.920 --> 01:43:33.780]
natural oils are sucked out of the root, leaving your hair soft, shiny, and exhausted. Nothing

[01:43:33.780 --> 01:43:39.880]
does the job like head. Great. Can I get head from my hairdresser Bruce? Probably, but you might

[01:43:39.880 --> 01:43:41.660]
want to try your girlfriend first.

[01:43:42.560 --> 01:43:50.900]
So I can get my head today, yeah, yeah, let's work, go the long, long way, yeah, yeah, you look better and you'll feel

[01:43:50.900 --> 01:43:54.780]
terrific, yeah, yeah, when you get head, you're a lucky step.

[01:43:55.500 --> 01:44:00.860]
What hair with lots of volume? Nothing gets it up like head. Available at a price you won't find

[01:44:00.860 --> 01:44:03.640]
hard to swallow, and it's going down every day.

[01:44:05.820 --> 01:44:10.380]
Connie, we're out of shampoo. Can you go out and get some head?

[01:44:10.940 --> 01:44:15.920]
What did you say? I said I want you to go out and get head.

[01:44:16.200 --> 01:44:19.980]
Oh, thank you, sweet Jesus, I'm going down down.

[01:44:20.500 --> 01:44:25.320]
And head makes a great holiday gift. Last Christmas, my wife gave me some head.

[01:44:25.820 --> 01:44:29.320]
Then I gave her a pearl necklace. I've never seen her so choke up.

[01:44:29.700 --> 01:44:33.980]
My girlfriend used to give me head, then we got married. Now I'm lucky if I get Jurgens

[01:44:33.980 --> 01:44:35.620]
lotion and a national cheer grab.

[01:45:05.100 --> 01:45:08.520]
Oh yeah, oh god.

[01:45:11.540 --> 01:45:16.880]
Head shampoo. Come on, give it a shot. My hair looks great.

[01:45:18.620 --> 01:45:19.640]
You're the map.

[01:45:23.240 --> 01:45:28.660]
Yo, man, we'll start with your Gothamers book. So anyway, let's do a model in West Palm Beach.

[01:45:29.220 --> 01:45:31.860]
Neil, can't disagree with you more about the pot smolty.

[01:45:32.160 --> 01:45:36.780]
Okay, I'm an ex pot addict from the age of 15 to 25.

[01:45:36.900 --> 01:45:40.360]
Yeah, I'm telling you, I was more dicting than code than anything.

[01:45:40.360 --> 01:45:43.480]
I mean, we had to start more dicting than fish food too, I bet.

[01:45:43.620 --> 01:45:45.640]
Correct. You're joking in this pants another room.

[01:45:45.760 --> 01:45:47.080]
Better take a sample, by the way.

[01:45:47.340 --> 01:45:51.560]
Before we got 38 now, I stopped 13 years ago, but before we played baseball, we smoked,

[01:45:51.760 --> 01:45:55.380]
before we went to the movies to smoke, before we had sex, we smoked, before anything,

[01:45:55.380 --> 01:45:57.820]
we need a pot. We couldn't do it without pot.

[01:45:58.140 --> 01:46:00.280]
Yeah, a lot of my friends are still a lot of people.

[01:46:00.280 --> 01:46:04.200]
Let me ask you this as much as I frown upon people who are like obsessed with pot,

[01:46:04.320 --> 01:46:07.940]
because there are people who are juvenile and sit around sifting and picking seeds all day,

[01:46:07.960 --> 01:46:12.020]
and I think that's a life, but nevertheless, how did it have to wait a minute?

[01:46:12.260 --> 01:46:14.620]
But how did they have this green stuff that had no seeds in them?

[01:46:14.620 --> 01:46:16.380]
I mean, how did it affect your life?

[01:46:16.600 --> 01:46:20.860]
It affected it tremendously because it opened the door to, and you're going to think this is

[01:46:20.860 --> 01:46:25.560]
joking. Open the door to Coke. It opened the door to the toilet.

[01:46:25.940 --> 01:46:26.160]
Yeah, yeah.

[01:46:26.320 --> 01:46:29.820]
No, once you violate your body, I guess you better never have a beer because next thing you're

[01:46:29.820 --> 01:46:33.580]
going to be dead on. I never liked beer, but I'm telling you, it affected me in the workplace,

[01:46:33.580 --> 01:46:36.040]
it affected me driving. I had a lot of...

[01:46:36.040 --> 01:46:39.660]
No, but the argument that, you know, it's the same argument as you better never have a beer,

[01:46:39.660 --> 01:46:42.400]
because then you're going to become an alcoholic, and you're going to start drinking,

[01:46:42.540 --> 01:46:47.660]
you know, sticking vodka bottles in your pocket. I mean, there are always going to people,

[01:46:47.660 --> 01:46:50.880]
be people no matter what you're talking about, they're the alcohol stains of the world are going

[01:46:50.880 --> 01:46:54.620]
to go out and eat until they get to be 500 pounds. Does that mean we should outlaw any foods

[01:46:54.620 --> 01:46:59.180]
that are fattening? No, no, but I, you know, I've changed, I have two kids of my own now,

[01:47:00.140 --> 01:47:05.860]
and they're 14 and 11, and they're getting to that age where I remember when I was...

[01:47:05.860 --> 01:47:09.120]
Were they just going to let you better stop? Yeah, no, no, no, I've stopped a long time ago,

[01:47:09.280 --> 01:47:13.100]
but I'm saying now I'm overprotective. He can smell like his debris in his home.

[01:47:13.240 --> 01:47:16.860]
I mean, by parents, like George's, there were refugees from Cuba that came down here.

[01:47:16.860 --> 01:47:20.420]
Well, no humans don't smoke, we know that. They didn't know any better,

[01:47:20.420 --> 01:47:23.800]
they were working 14 hours a day, I was alone at home, and all my friends did,

[01:47:23.960 --> 01:47:27.860]
and we did, and I'm telling them I didn't know anything, but I couldn't disagree with you

[01:47:27.860 --> 01:47:32.900]
anymore. I'm testing for it, and I hope they keep it out of everything, because it's

[01:47:32.900 --> 01:47:35.720]
different from my life. You know something, I know that when I go over to Holland man,

[01:47:35.840 --> 01:47:38.460]
every time I've only been in Amsterdam about 30 times, I'm going to go over there,

[01:47:38.500 --> 01:47:42.660]
it's a miracle that the country can function, you know what? Let me tell you something,

[01:47:43.140 --> 01:47:48.340]
well, while we were at it, we were less aggressive. Let me ask you, have you ever been to Amsterdam?

[01:47:48.940 --> 01:47:51.500]
Never been to Holland. Well, get on a plane to go there, you might learn something.

[01:47:51.820 --> 01:47:55.100]
There's a pot addict for you there, boys and girls, there's a good lesson for everybody.

[01:47:55.540 --> 01:47:59.300]
He's obsessed. It's like the fish food addicts. I say we go to publics right now,

[01:47:59.420 --> 01:48:02.480]
and we may enforce them to take it right out of the freezer container, because we have fish food

[01:48:02.480 --> 01:48:05.620]
addicts already, and those people are going to kill themselves on that crap, because they're out of

[01:48:05.620 --> 01:48:10.900]
control. And let's close down every bar, because we got alcoholics. Let's bring back pro-abition,

[01:48:10.900 --> 01:48:15.140]
baby. Let's prohibit everything. Then we got sex addicts. Just watch, what's his name?

[01:48:15.280 --> 01:48:19.520]
Jerry Springer, he'll do about 20 shows on that this week. Sex addicts. People who can't get enough,

[01:48:19.540 --> 01:48:24.140]
they're doing it. The NBA they want to do drug testing. We got a guy, a Canadian, a jock,

[01:48:24.320 --> 01:48:28.400]
if a snowboarder can wear a jock strap, whatever the hell he was. This guy may lose his gold medal,

[01:48:28.400 --> 01:48:32.200]
because he may have actually inhaled a little bit, or may have actually smoked a little bit,

[01:48:32.400 --> 01:48:35.760]
or may have actually walked through a room somewhere where somebody may have smoked it, or not,

[01:48:35.760 --> 01:48:39.040]
as the case may be. And they found like a little trace in his...

[01:48:39.040 --> 01:48:42.660]
Squirt, Squirt? Yeah. And they're having a nervous breakdown now, because they, you know,

[01:48:42.880 --> 01:48:47.920]
suit a fed. What else? What else can we test for in your system? Definitely have fish food testing,

[01:48:47.920 --> 01:48:51.380]
because we know it makes your blood sugar go away up, and you become irresponsible, and got

[01:48:51.380 --> 01:48:54.960]
only knows you're going to, you're not fit for driving. I wouldn't be surprised if they stop

[01:48:54.960 --> 01:48:58.760]
you at street corners now. It's stoplights, and they do on the spot checks blood sugar test.

[01:48:58.920 --> 01:49:04.040]
You know, they give you that little pin prick, if I can say that. And yeah, look at my finger tips,

[01:49:04.040 --> 01:49:08.280]
man, look at all those pin pricks. That's right, when you diabetic. You have a lot of pin pricks

[01:49:08.280 --> 01:49:12.600]
on the tips of your fingers, but at any rate, they're going to be starting to do that spot checks

[01:49:12.600 --> 01:49:17.260]
on street corners now. And if your blood sugar is like over 250, but, hey, you're straight to jail!

[01:49:17.900 --> 01:49:20.160]
You're a menace to society, you're going to kill somebody out there.

[01:49:20.780 --> 01:49:24.400]
Airline pilot, before you get on that plane, make sure he didn't have no fish food before he took

[01:49:24.400 --> 01:49:30.980]
off. Here's the four-letter deal. Hello. Yes, sir. For some color, I guess I'd be in acute colors,

[01:49:30.980 --> 01:49:36.940]
since I'm not chronic. Okay. Anyway, I consider myself a well-trained, high-precision cynic.

[01:49:37.160 --> 01:49:40.840]
Yes, sir. You're like me with a lot of the things that you talk about. But in the United States, of

[01:49:40.840 --> 01:49:44.980]
course, what right we all have really is the right to be as irresponsible as we want to be,

[01:49:45.300 --> 01:49:50.140]
until you reach a certain limit. And we have these freedoms, and people sort of they abuse them

[01:49:50.140 --> 01:49:53.600]
until it starts costing somebody some money somewhere, and then they got to go and do something

[01:49:53.600 --> 01:49:59.380]
about taking that freedom away. But what does that mean? When has marijuana ever been decriminalized

[01:49:59.380 --> 01:50:04.800]
in America? Well, I mean, it hasn't. But the reasons for that. Are they tried prohibition with

[01:50:04.800 --> 01:50:09.460]
booze? That's your work real well, didn't it? No, and it's a problem. Work for Joe Kennedy real well.

[01:50:09.540 --> 01:50:13.860]
If you can't expect our people to be responsible with the freedoms that they have, like we have a small

[01:50:13.860 --> 01:50:18.840]
business, and we've got, you know, we do contracting enough sort of thing, and you've got guys,

[01:50:19.020 --> 01:50:24.980]
they're not exactly the top model society, but they go out and they're doing physical labor for you,

[01:50:24.980 --> 01:50:30.060]
and they're either climbing rooftops and things like that, and we've had cases in the past where

[01:50:30.060 --> 01:50:34.580]
people were on the influence of the substance, and they can't access it. And then the customer,

[01:50:34.800 --> 01:50:38.860]
well, if you're liable for it, I can understand it, and you're talking about a physical right,

[01:50:38.960 --> 01:50:43.660]
I understand it. And then not only that, but the employee who's you too, even though he was the one

[01:50:43.660 --> 01:50:48.000]
who was irresponsible on the job. So what do you do about that? Well, in that case, that's an

[01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:52.780]
exception. I wouldn't have any problem with that. I can see an NBA where if a guy is stone, he's not

[01:50:52.780 --> 01:50:56.200]
going to injure somebody out on the court, if anything, he'll take fewer shots. And he probably

[01:50:56.200 --> 01:51:00.700]
wouldn't beat up the coach. Well, a good point. But the thing is, we have something that we do at

[01:51:00.700 --> 01:51:04.400]
work here, not that it works, but it's an attempt anyway that's called a drug free workplace.

[01:51:05.020 --> 01:51:08.960]
And you start off your relationship with the business under the assumption that, you know,

[01:51:09.040 --> 01:51:12.100]
you're not going to, this isn't going to be something you're going to be doing on the job. So

[01:51:12.100 --> 01:51:16.220]
we're allowed to drug test before you start the job and that sort of thing. And what's sad about

[01:51:16.220 --> 01:51:20.540]
this is it's amazing how many people who call up looking for a job, and you say, oh, but by the

[01:51:20.540 --> 01:51:24.420]
way, this is a drug free workplace, how many people show up fill out the forms and then just never

[01:51:24.420 --> 01:51:30.760]
appear again. But isn't that their choice? You just got to your family. But, you know, but the thing is,

[01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:35.700]
if business is going to be responsible for what its employees do, then we have to know we have to

[01:51:35.700 --> 01:51:39.180]
feel safe and secure that they're not going to be out to our agency. No, I would have known with that.

[01:51:39.240 --> 01:51:43.280]
I think that you got a, you know, you have a right because you're liable and you have a right to

[01:51:43.280 --> 01:51:48.740]
make sure that they're not doing whatever might impair their senses, etc. But that's a very rare

[01:51:48.740 --> 01:51:53.620]
exception. If somebody's doing an office job at a desk, unless of course they're making decisions,

[01:51:54.240 --> 01:51:59.060]
decisions that, you know, are like national security risking something like that. Yeah, I can

[01:51:59.060 --> 01:52:05.260]
understand that. Or for radio equipment or something like that. Exactly. And I think I might help

[01:52:05.260 --> 01:52:09.960]
have some drugs for these bastards over here. But the thing is, you know, once again, as a society,

[01:52:10.100 --> 01:52:14.720]
if the people aren't going to be responsible enough to be able to decide when they are aren't going

[01:52:14.720 --> 01:52:18.120]
to use the substances you can't expect. But you know, you know, something, you can't expect them to be

[01:52:18.120 --> 01:52:21.760]
involved. But you know, something, sir, let me say something to you. And that is that as long

[01:52:21.760 --> 01:52:26.140]
as things are forbidden, when you go to Europe, there is no drinking age in any country that I

[01:52:26.140 --> 01:52:31.880]
know of in Europe. And yet, as Italy, especially, public drunkenness is frowned upon to such an extent that,

[01:52:32.020 --> 01:52:35.220]
I mean, they would, they would come and beat the crap out of you if they found you staggering around

[01:52:35.220 --> 01:52:39.600]
drunken the street. They would take you under cover somewhere and give you a lecture and sober you

[01:52:39.600 --> 01:52:44.460]
up and tell you better not to ever do it again. And you don't, you don't have any problem of young

[01:52:44.460 --> 01:52:48.760]
people staggering around drunk or killing each other because they're drinking and driving. You

[01:52:48.760 --> 01:52:52.200]
don't have that. Now the French have it because they got a bunch of drumps over there to begin with.

[01:52:52.380 --> 01:52:55.840]
But I'm talking about in countries where they're generally socially responsible in the first place,

[01:52:56.020 --> 01:53:00.700]
like Italy and like Holland and those. You don't have that problem. There's no drinking age.

[01:53:00.800 --> 01:53:02.000]
There's no smoking age. There's no smoking age.

[01:53:02.120 --> 01:53:05.960]
There's no alcoholism rates, you know, in the world, though. And why have this fame in Russia have very

[01:53:05.960 --> 01:53:10.040]
high alcoholism rates and they also have... What does that have to do with Italy? It doesn't.

[01:53:10.740 --> 01:53:14.520]
What does that have to do with Holland, which is the freest country in the world? What does that have to do with it?

[01:53:14.540 --> 01:53:16.880]
It depends on the culture. They grow up with that kind of freedom and the U.S.

[01:53:17.300 --> 01:53:22.160]
Ah, there you go. That's what I just got through saying to you. So as big older you make things for

[01:53:22.160 --> 01:53:27.620]
bitten the more people want them. That's my point. Okay, before I leave or you cut off...

[01:53:27.620 --> 01:53:31.620]
I want to give you something. I don't know if you can use this as a card, but I want to do a

[01:53:31.620 --> 01:53:39.900]
celebrity impersonation for you. Yeah. Okay, see it. Now that wasn't bad. Georgia was almost

[01:53:39.900 --> 01:53:43.920]
cute. It wasn't a very good... Yeah. The consensus is, let's see, Mike from the key says it's too

[01:53:43.920 --> 01:53:48.260]
expensive. That's his... Wow, that's his opinion. He likes it a little weed now and he said,

[01:53:48.400 --> 01:53:52.760]
too damn expensive. Here's Miami. Hello. Neil. Yes, sir. What's up, Neil? I love your show.

[01:53:53.040 --> 01:53:58.660]
Thank you so much. Listen, it is kind of expensive, but I wanted to say this whole Marijuana thing is

[01:53:58.660 --> 01:54:03.940]
just out of hand. I mean, the government, they must be some like babbling chimps, pushing buttons

[01:54:03.940 --> 01:54:08.160]
somewhere. They don't realize that Marijuana is probably the basis in toxic on this planet.

[01:54:08.160 --> 01:54:13.240]
It's less harmful than alcohol. It has never been documented to give cancer like, you know,

[01:54:13.400 --> 01:54:17.280]
cigar and cigar. Yeah. I'm not complaining about cigar. It doesn't send your blood sugar raising

[01:54:17.280 --> 01:54:21.640]
up like sugar does either, but sugar. I guarantee you right now, sugar was a lot more dangerous

[01:54:21.640 --> 01:54:26.580]
than marijuana ever can be. And I don't think they did any sugar testing on this Schmendor

[01:54:26.580 --> 01:54:30.780]
Gabriotti guy at this snowboard that won a gold medal over their nogginal. Absolutely. It's sugar.

[01:54:30.780 --> 01:54:34.340]
Let's take his blood sugar and see if he was doing fish food before he did the thing.

[01:54:34.760 --> 01:54:39.860]
Absolutely. And, you know, I like the guys too. I was listening to the idea. I was wondering how come

[01:54:39.860 --> 01:54:43.840]
you didn't like Garcia and Vegas. I wanted to ask you out as well. That's like my cigar.

[01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:48.100]
You know, I do like Garcia Vegas. I like them, but it's they don't make them in Nix, which is my

[01:54:48.100 --> 01:54:52.000]
sponsor. So I'm not going to come on here and say, hey, I smoke Garcia Vegas. Which one do you like

[01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:56.840]
in particular? The Galante's? You never have the English Corona's? Oh, I don't touch those

[01:54:56.840 --> 01:55:00.100]
English ones. Oh, yeah. The English Corona's are fabulous, especially if you're rolling your

[01:55:00.100 --> 01:55:05.540]
open. Okay. But thank you, Roniel. Okay. Have a great day. Let's go to Miami. Hello.

[01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:10.380]
Neil. Yes, sir. Hey, how's it going? Great. Well, listen, you know, a couple bad things.

[01:55:10.520 --> 01:55:14.240]
Unfortunately, marijuana is classified as a schedule one drug, which means it's right up there

[01:55:14.240 --> 01:55:20.880]
with cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, and Jerry Springer is perhaps the worst drugs of all mankind.

[01:55:21.940 --> 01:55:27.820]
And fish food. And fish food. But, you know, this is just a word for that guy who was that guy

[01:55:28.220 --> 01:55:32.980]
kidding when he there was a guy you called in. He said, I run a workplace and I tell people that I

[01:55:32.980 --> 01:55:37.840]
drug test, but I don't really drug test. And then that just sort of weed out the part in mind

[01:55:37.840 --> 01:55:43.440]
the point. I mean, we doubt the people that really don't want to get drug. What was it? What was it?

[01:55:43.440 --> 01:55:48.160]
What was I missed that whole thing? But he said that he drug tested drug test. No, he's done drug

[01:55:48.160 --> 01:55:51.300]
test. And he said that a lot of people come by and they fill out the application when they find

[01:55:51.300 --> 01:55:55.580]
out it's a drug free workplace that they don't hear from him again is what he said. All right. Well,

[01:55:55.580 --> 01:55:59.720]
I think he's a fascist because, you know, he's basically just got a bunch of people that we're

[01:55:59.720 --> 01:56:04.380]
doing like yard work or something, you know. But they're going up on roofs and things and he's

[01:56:04.380 --> 01:56:09.840]
responsible. He's got the liability insurance for that. I can understand that. I don't know, man.

[01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:13.580]
I mean, if you're if you're still looking, if you're still not on any substance, I don't care what

[01:56:13.580 --> 01:56:18.160]
is. I don't want to be responsible for your work or driving or whatever else you're doing.

[01:56:18.300 --> 01:56:22.120]
You know, the thing is that they might not be up on the roof and be stoned at the same time.

[01:56:22.120 --> 01:56:25.820]
They might go home, watch Jerry Springer and then be stoned and then go back to work and be

[01:56:25.820 --> 01:56:29.640]
perfectly straight and still fail at miserable tests. Okay, I think this shows on now. What the

[01:56:29.640 --> 01:56:33.360]
hell was the point? I wasn't that away to run long enough to find out. Here's a lady in Miami.

[01:56:33.380 --> 01:56:38.400]
Hello. Hello, Neil. Yes, ma'am. Hi, how are you? Great. How you be doing? I'd be doing fine.

[01:56:38.660 --> 01:56:42.540]
All right. I just wanted to make a comment about the pot head that called earlier that said he's

[01:56:42.540 --> 01:56:48.200]
more for 10 years. Yeah. He said that the marijuana made him try other drugs. I think that he's

[01:56:48.200 --> 01:56:52.900]
been betrayed as everyone else has been betrayed by all the upside people in this country because

[01:56:52.900 --> 01:56:58.400]
they tell you that marijuana be bad for you and it's evil and all this stuff. And then when you try

[01:56:58.400 --> 01:57:02.420]
it and it's not that bad, you say, well, they lied about this. Well, maybe they lied about everything

[01:57:02.420 --> 01:57:11.620]
else too. So deliciously different marijuana deliciously different marijuana.

[01:57:14.220 --> 01:57:19.660]
This poor guy is going to go back to Canada with his middle between his legs. Never be the same again

[01:57:19.660 --> 01:57:24.080]
because they found this little teeny tiny trace of marriage wini in his test.

[01:57:24.880 --> 01:57:29.740]
Neil? Yes. I say we all get on a plane, go to Italy and smoke a blight. All right.

[01:57:29.900 --> 01:57:33.420]
All right. See you. Hi. The Pope is over there. He's doing it. If it's okay for the Pope,

[01:57:33.540 --> 01:57:37.500]
how come I didn't smoke it? Well, you think that big puffer over the Vatican is? That's not what

[01:57:37.500 --> 01:57:42.500]
you think it is. That's the celebratory smoke. Yeah, they're celebrating it all right. Why do you

[01:57:42.500 --> 01:57:46.160]
think they keep burning incense? Covered up. That's why they do a lot of things. That's why they put

[01:57:46.160 --> 01:57:50.120]
those gowns on to cover it up. That's why they wear those kilts and sculls and baby. Covered up.

[01:58:07.500 --> 01:58:14.140]
Ask anybody in that neighborhood. They tell you this country where the Gantra be good.

[01:58:14.960 --> 01:58:22.560]
Raslanan has some he wants to sell and from a mile away you can detect the smell of smoke.

[01:58:24.180 --> 01:58:34.000]
Smoke Gantra smoke smoke. He light up the split and talk. Smoke Gantra smoke smoke.

[01:58:35.120 --> 01:58:47.980]
Smoke Gantra smoke smoke. The Gantra be good. You can carry lots of herb in the gunny sack.

[01:58:48.760 --> 01:58:59.540]
Smoke it every day until your longstone blight. With all the money that we have made. Jamaica doesn't need any foreign aid.

[01:58:59.540 --> 01:59:07.880]
American tourists come here and say, got nothing like this in the US say they smoke.

[01:59:09.300 --> 01:59:19.260]
Smoke Gantra smoke smoke. They light up the split and talk. They begin to cough and choke.

[01:59:20.680 --> 01:59:27.000]
Smoke Gantra smoke smoke. The Gantra be good.

[01:59:30.380 --> 01:59:37.260]
Mama tell her son you are an astamian. You like to smoke the giant stiff whenever you can.

[01:59:38.200 --> 01:59:44.520]
Many people coming here for miles around. A bite the earth for you by the ounce of nip.

[01:59:45.620 --> 01:59:53.200]
Raslanan say to her mama you right. They can't you be good tonight and then they smoke.

[01:59:54.740 --> 02:00:00.820]
Smoke Gantra smoke smoke. They light up the split and talk.

[02:00:02.480 --> 02:00:08.300]
Smoke Gantra smoke smoke. Smoke Gantra smoke smoke.

[02:00:08.300 --> 02:00:12.280]
Smoke Gantra smoke smoke. They can't you be good.

[02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:21.220]
Yamon why don't you go back to Canada you two bastard.

[02:00:21.660 --> 02:00:25.040]
Nieu my queen God.

[02:00:25.680 --> 02:00:28.900]
No the Affleck casting call.

[02:00:29.380 --> 02:00:30.500]
All right Tom Broca.

[02:00:31.380 --> 02:00:32.380]

It's crazy.

[02:01:12.360 --> 02:01:13.440]
It's insanity.

[02:01:13.680 --> 02:01:14.760]
Great the line, please.

[02:01:15.020 --> 02:01:16.140]

You got the job.

[02:01:52.800 --> 02:01:54.180]

you can play with each other's wood

[02:07:18.100 --> 02:07:20.340]

they don't keep well

[02:07:46.860 --> 02:07:48.960]
besides why black people want to eat

[02:07:48.960 --> 02:07:49.760]

but they talk too loud with funny lips

[02:08:09.960 --> 02:08:11.220]
they serve other customers

[02:08:11.220 --> 02:08:11.880]

You're crushing from me with one mighty blow

[02:15:05.900 --> 02:15:17.640]
When we're there we go down

She went shopping for a brand new look

[02:16:38.800 --> 02:16:41.780]
and she steals the item right on the book

[02:16:42.300 --> 02:16:45.000]
Not too happy with the feel curious

[02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:47.900]
Under deep deep is what she wants to be

[02:16:47.900 --> 02:16:49.440]

Watches new clothes so she grabs the view

[02:16:57.700 --> 02:17:00.580]
On the ragged sack in Avenue

[02:17:00.580 --> 02:17:03.860]

That's three lanes wide

[02:17:24.180 --> 02:17:26.600]
I can't see over the view

[02:17:26.600 --> 02:17:29.000]

The truth is finally out that Jean Mandage was truly the fifth beat.

[02:23:08.980 --> 02:23:12.080]
You gotta give it a little love and give it a little love.

[02:23:13.240 --> 02:23:15.300]
Everyone looks alive.

[02:23:17.080 --> 02:23:20.020]
To be, now your head's to save.

[02:23:20.720 --> 02:23:22.480]

That's a random among anyway.

[02:23:45.820 --> 02:23:51.020]
The mad dog was just a little ambivalent when we asked him if he wanted to do it again.

[02:23:51.160 --> 02:23:52.940]
Now, I don't think so.

[02:23:53.020 --> 02:23:59.500]
So we had Luke the Broughtsey family little visit and tell him either his brains or his signature would wind up on the contract.

ran a six million dollar prostitution ring how do you like that

[02:27:20.240 --> 02:27:24.600]
in fort lauderdale he had fifty women under payroll their names neatly lined up on

[02:27:24.600 --> 02:27:28.000]

everything in his god damn countries illegal man everything is uh... the forbidden

[02:27:51.620 --> 02:27:55.740]
fruit if we can say on of course that's so forget that talk about a fruit

[02:27:56.320 --> 02:27:58.420]
forget about that everything's illegal

[02:27:59.280 --> 02:28:02.280]
everything's immoral unless of course it's the politicians who are doing it

[02:28:02.280 --> 02:28:06.680]
like dan romer he's doing it over there and like uh... bill clinton of course he's uh...

[02:28:06.680 --> 02:28:10.160]
doing it the left and right in which we like him a lot more respect him because he's

[02:28:10.160 --> 02:28:13.400]
getting that that's okay but if we're getting at the next course it's evil and we all

[02:28:13.400 --> 02:28:20.640]
go to go to jail chuvan island unacceptable on acceptable your brainwashed baby when you

[02:28:20.640 --> 02:28:24.620]

[02:28:24.620 --> 02:28:29.260]
goody two shoes we have to have a drinking age and we have to have a we have to have an age for

[02:28:29.260 --> 02:28:33.840]
everything a smoking age in other words when you're twenty one it's okay to get yourself

[02:28:33.840 --> 02:28:37.340]
lung cancer but if you're nineteen and that you're not old enough to make that decision

[02:28:37.340 --> 02:28:42.420]
just like this crap about the age of majority every you know most countries where it's just a

[02:28:42.420 --> 02:28:46.920]
matter of opinion most countries even some that we consider very backward uh... the the legal

[02:28:46.920 --> 02:28:52.680]
age for consensual sexual acts is fifteen or sixteen in this country it's what seventeen for

[02:28:52.680 --> 02:28:57.940]
heterosexual acts and eighteen for yes here there's a different age for heterosexual or homosexual

[02:28:57.940 --> 02:29:03.120]
acts of course or is it eighteen for both there's all these gray areas depending on which state

[02:29:03.120 --> 02:29:07.620]
you're in i didn't say gay areas i said what what's well we'll find out what state you're in

lies in a prone or uh... what position if if you're more than two years older you can be sixteen

[02:29:12.020 --> 02:29:15.060]
as long as the person isn't more than two years older and over eight while it's an

[02:29:15.060 --> 02:29:19.560]
added so in other words if a little guy's banged a sixteen year old chick he's in violation of

[02:29:19.560 --> 02:29:23.760]
laws that we're saying to me something like that isn't that ridiculous yeah isn't that absurd

[02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:42.640]
i'm james brown

[02:33:42.640 --> 02:33:43.460]
nil

[02:33:43.460 --> 02:33:45.060]
uh included

[02:33:46.100 --> 02:33:47.720]
here's minis springs hello

[02:33:48.500 --> 02:33:52.180]
yeah hi i was calling because i heard the guy talking about

[02:33:52.180 --> 02:33:54.980]
uh the fact that it was legal and it was legal

[02:33:54.980 --> 02:33:57.540]
but you know i don't i don't smoke marijuana

[02:33:57.540 --> 02:33:59.660]
i haven't done since college days but

[02:33:59.660 --> 02:34:02.400]
but the thing is i'm a firm believer that uh

[02:34:02.400 --> 02:34:04.060]
as long as it doesn't kill you

[02:34:04.060 --> 02:34:06.420]
and you're harming anybody else go ahead and do

[02:34:06.420 --> 02:34:08.220]
let me ask you this

[02:34:08.220 --> 02:34:10.380]
can you go into a drugstore right now

[02:34:10.380 --> 02:34:11.400]
and buy rat poison

[02:34:11.820 --> 02:34:13.200]
yes yes you can

[02:34:13.200 --> 02:34:17.120]
and that will kill you and you know it's got warning labels on the on the can or

[02:34:17.120 --> 02:34:18.060]
whatever you're buying it

[02:34:18.060 --> 02:34:20.500]
and you can go you can go into any story

[02:34:20.500 --> 02:34:22.360]
you can go into a supermarket you go into drugstore

[02:34:22.360 --> 02:34:26.240]
and by legally all kinds of substances that will kill you

[02:34:26.240 --> 02:34:28.600]
you can go into home depot and buy paint thinner

[02:34:28.600 --> 02:34:30.520]
and if you drink it it will kill you

[02:34:30.520 --> 02:34:32.480]
i guarantee you that make no mistake about it

[02:34:32.480 --> 02:34:36.240]
so the idea that something may or may not be harmful for you which is all very

[02:34:36.240 --> 02:34:39.440]
subjective by the way and a lot of it very dubious and debatable

[02:34:39.440 --> 02:34:43.760]
but since when is that the guy the only job that i see the government is to tell us

[02:34:43.760 --> 02:34:45.360]
you know give us the information

[02:34:45.360 --> 02:34:48.580]
tell us can this be harmful to me how harmful is it

[02:34:48.580 --> 02:34:50.160]
and then let me make my own guide damn decision

[02:34:50.160 --> 02:34:51.520]
well that's what i'm saying

[02:34:51.520 --> 02:34:55.240]
you know the thing is is that the only reason it was made illegal

[02:34:55.240 --> 02:34:59.620]
is because it's relatively easy to grow and difficult to attack

[02:34:59.620 --> 02:35:04.060]
and by the lobbying of both alcohol

[02:35:04.060 --> 02:35:08.160]
and cigarettes which it's well alcohol is relatively easy

[02:35:08.160 --> 02:35:10.740]
but the question of cigarettes growing it

[02:35:10.740 --> 02:35:14.240]
drying it out and actually making cigarettes on your own most people aren't going to do

[02:35:14.240 --> 02:35:17.740]
whereas anybody could like grow plant in a backyard

[02:35:17.740 --> 02:35:19.880]
and they just simply take a few leaves

[02:35:19.880 --> 02:35:22.240]
let them dry out in the oven and then smoke it

[02:35:22.240 --> 02:35:22.880]
oh my god

[02:35:22.880 --> 02:35:27.160]
and apparently that's what they don't want

[02:35:27.160 --> 02:35:30.660]
and there would be a lot of competition for those two other industries

[02:35:30.660 --> 02:35:32.220]
oh my god

[02:35:32.220 --> 02:35:36.520]
whereas in the back row that's proving beyond a shadow without

[02:35:36.520 --> 02:35:38.260]
that's killing people every day

[02:35:38.260 --> 02:35:40.640]
there are people puffing on faggots right now

[02:35:40.640 --> 02:35:42.400]
who are going to croak from lung cancer

[02:35:42.400 --> 02:35:45.160]
and emphysema and we've warned them and we've warned them

[02:35:45.160 --> 02:35:46.880]
and we've had all those craggy voice guys

[02:35:46.880 --> 02:35:49.420]
the guy that used to play Hamilton burger on peri Mason

[02:35:49.420 --> 02:35:51.040]
what the hell was his name and what the guy i'm talking about

[02:35:51.040 --> 02:35:52.600]
i'm dying from lung cancer

[02:35:52.600 --> 02:35:55.640]
and John Wayne and all these other big macho guys that are croaking

[02:35:55.640 --> 02:35:57.180]
and if you you know they tell you that

[02:35:57.180 --> 02:35:59.780]
and you still want to smoke then go ahead be my guest

[02:35:59.780 --> 02:36:01.740]
and enclosed just don't blow it in my face

[02:36:01.740 --> 02:36:03.560]
that's what the moniker said

[02:36:03.560 --> 02:36:05.180]
they're puffing on cigarettes too

[02:36:05.780 --> 02:36:07.140]
exactly have a great day

[02:36:07.140 --> 02:36:09.340]
okay what are we getting all worked up about

[02:36:09.340 --> 02:36:10.980]
just because we realize we live in a country

[02:36:10.980 --> 02:36:12.320]
where our freedoms are very limited

[02:36:12.320 --> 02:36:15.300]
we have a bunch of assholes sitting around deciding

[02:36:15.300 --> 02:36:16.640]
what you can do and what you can't do

[02:36:16.640 --> 02:36:18.180]
and telling you what's good for you and what's not

[02:36:18.180 --> 02:36:20.900]
and then we have some idiots who are going along with that

[02:36:20.900 --> 02:36:22.140]
who want to be manipulated

[02:36:22.140 --> 02:36:25.700]
well if you want to be manipulated okay go to some fascist god damn place

[02:36:25.700 --> 02:36:27.100]
go to some communist country

[02:36:27.100 --> 02:36:28.340]

go live with the del he'll tell you what you can do

[02:36:30.580 --> 02:36:32.680]

under the watchful eye of the cardinals man i don't mean stand musiel

[02:36:39.080 --> 02:36:41.040]
you won't be able to do anything that's fun

[02:36:41.040 --> 02:36:43.060]
because they're busy doing taking them all up themselves

but breath there ain't no freak in french fries

[02:44:04.640 --> 02:44:07.940]
now get out of my sight before I shove your teeth so far down

[02:44:07.940 --> 02:44:11.640]
you f*** it so you'll have to sit on the jack burger to eat it

[02:44:11.640 --> 02:44:14.520]
oh and have a nice day

[02:44:15.580 --> 02:44:16.780]
I tried

[02:44:17.600 --> 02:44:18.940]
and there paint

[02:44:18.940 --> 02:44:23.520]
I don't think I like you anymore

[02:44:25.920 --> 02:44:28.620]
you used to watch me shave

[02:44:28.620 --> 02:44:31.520]
now you do stare at the floor

[02:44:31.520 --> 02:44:33.340]
and own there penis

[02:44:33.940 --> 02:44:36.140]
I don't like you anymore

[02:44:36.140 --> 02:44:44.660]
I used to be you and me a paper towel and a dirty magazine

[02:44:45.740 --> 02:44:49.440]
that's how we needed to get back

[02:44:52.040 --> 02:44:55.000]
now it seems things are changing

[02:44:55.000 --> 02:44:59.100]
I think that you're the one who blamed there penis

[02:44:59.100 --> 02:45:01.900]
I don't like you anymore

[02:45:01.900 --> 02:45:03.880]

[02:45:03.880 --> 02:45:05.960]
near right now

[02:45:05.960 --> 02:45:10.040]
I don't think I like you anymore

[02:45:12.480 --> 02:45:15.140]
because when you get to drinking

[02:45:15.900 --> 02:45:20.420]
you put me places I've never been before there right now

[02:45:20.420 --> 02:45:22.980]
I don't like you anymore

[02:45:25.920 --> 02:45:30.340]
why can't we just get a grip on our man to hand

[02:45:30.340 --> 02:45:31.720]
relationship

[02:45:32.340 --> 02:45:36.260]
time to time is a truly how we feel

[02:45:38.900 --> 02:45:41.920]
if we put our heads together

[02:45:41.920 --> 02:45:46.020]
we just stay home forever and there penis

[02:45:46.020 --> 02:45:49.180]
I don't like you after all

[02:45:50.480 --> 02:45:55.380]
oh and runny while you're shaving the shave my phone

[02:45:58.360 --> 02:45:58.980]
stop

[02:45:58.980 --> 02:46:03.120]
perhaps one of the most interesting words in the English language today is the word

[02:46:04.140 --> 02:46:08.140]
f**k out of all the English words that begin with a letter F

[02:46:08.140 --> 02:46:11.940]
is the only word that is referred to as the F word

[02:46:11.940 --> 02:46:14.580]
it's the one magical word

[02:46:14.580 --> 02:46:19.600]
just by its sound can describe pain, pleasure, hate and love

[02:46:19.600 --> 02:46:22.940]
f**k as most words in the English language

[02:46:22.940 --> 02:46:29.800]
is derived from German, the word flikin, which means to strike. In English, f*** falls into

[02:46:29.800 --> 02:46:36.860]
many grammatical categories as a transit of verb, for instance, John f***ed Shirley. Its

[02:46:36.860 --> 02:46:41.920]
meaning is not always sexual. It can be used as an adjective, such as John's doing all

[02:46:41.920 --> 02:46:50.160]
the f***ing work. As part of an adverb, Shirley talks to f***ing much. As an adverb, enhancing

[02:46:50.160 --> 02:46:58.000]
an adjective, Shirley is f***ing beautiful. As a noun, I don't give a f***ing. As part

[02:46:58.000 --> 02:47:05.980]
of a word, abso f***ing loosely or inf***ing credible. And as almost every word in a sentence,

[02:47:06.640 --> 02:47:12.240]
f***ing f***ing f***ers. As you must realize, there aren't too many words with the versatility

[02:47:12.240 --> 02:47:19.280]
of f***ing. As in these examples describing situations such as fraud, I got f***ed that

[02:47:19.280 --> 02:47:28.080]
they use carlot. This may, off f*** it. Trouble, I guess I'm really f***ed now. Aggression,

[02:47:28.680 --> 02:47:35.560]
don't f*** with me, buddy. This missile, why don't you go outside and play hide and go f*** yourself.

[02:47:36.360 --> 02:47:43.780]
I'm sure you can think of many more examples. Say it loudly and proudly. F*** you!

[02:47:43.780 --> 02:47:54.260]

Be careful with that.

[02:49:46.440 --> 02:49:47.940]

This is Stand By and Steam for Sofa King.

And Sofa King's price is not as low,

[02:51:18.700 --> 02:51:19.740]
they're so fucking low.

[02:51:20.040 --> 02:51:21.580]
You'll never find them anywhere else.

Listen to me.

[02:51:22.700 --> 02:51:24.440]

Sofa King good.

[02:51:57.300 --> 02:52:01.160]
It used to be hot back in the good old days,

[02:52:01.760 --> 02:52:05.300]
before the old part came and politicians stayed whole day.

[02:52:06.340 --> 02:52:09.100]
This town was once alive.

[02:52:10.680 --> 02:52:12.840]
They even had spring grey.

[02:52:14.760 --> 02:52:18.100]
There were things to do all night,

[02:52:19.560 --> 02:52:21.040]
inbroward and in day.

[02:52:21.540 --> 02:52:23.140]
Let the old fart walking dead,

[02:52:23.460 --> 02:52:25.200]
and the tower to the left,

[02:52:25.760 --> 02:52:27.100]
the crooked wheels,

[02:52:27.620 --> 02:52:29.360]
who just got off the boat.

[02:52:29.440 --> 02:52:31.720]
I heard Neil Rogers cry.

[02:52:33.320 --> 02:52:37.160]
It's just a day that cry on me die.

[02:52:39.420 --> 02:52:41.360]
Everyone who thought the day knew best,

[02:52:41.540 --> 02:52:42.680]
or the ones who brought us forward,

[02:52:42.840 --> 02:52:45.040]
they told us to buy a meal.

[02:52:46.160 --> 02:52:49.080]
Can you believe there was a time?

[02:52:50.520 --> 02:52:52.120]
They had casinos and hal

[02:52:52.120 --> 02:52:52.980]
and dales,

[02:52:54.740 --> 02:52:57.180]
tried to organize the crime,

[02:52:58.880 --> 02:53:01.120]
but the experiments had failed.

[02:53:01.120 --> 02:53:03.240]
When the brain did kick his down,

[02:53:03.400 --> 02:53:05.400]
and tore the thugs up down,

[02:53:05.620 --> 02:53:07.380]
they pissed along the place.

[02:53:07.600 --> 02:53:09.300]
It's a big cut in the screen.

[02:53:09.440 --> 02:53:11.560]
I heard Neil Rogers cry.

[02:53:13.280 --> 02:53:16.720]
This is the day that cry on me die.

[02:53:19.180 --> 02:53:21.260]
Why did they place a cousin in

[02:53:21.260 --> 02:53:22.980]
what's self-serving as a woman

[02:53:22.980 --> 02:53:25.020]
was at the knee?

[02:53:26.180 --> 02:53:28.360]
I heard Neil Rogers cry.

[02:53:29.900 --> 02:53:34.360]
What about the bad boy?

[02:53:37.460 --> 02:53:40.500]
All the white folks hate the black folks,

[02:53:40.720 --> 02:53:42.920]
and the black folks hate the white folks,

[02:53:43.040 --> 02:53:45.180]
to hate all but the right folks

[02:53:45.180 --> 02:53:47.080]
is an old established rule,

[02:53:47.280 --> 02:53:50.000]
but during the national brotherhood week,

[02:53:50.000 --> 02:53:52.600]
national brotherhood week,

[02:53:52.960 --> 02:53:55.040]
lean a horn and sheriff's park

[02:53:55.040 --> 02:53:57.040]
are dancing cheap to cheeky.

[02:53:57.040 --> 02:54:01.480]
It's fun to utilize the people you despise

[02:54:01.480 --> 02:54:04.500]
as long as you don't let them in your school.

[02:54:08.040 --> 02:54:10.360]
Older poor folks hate the rich folks,

[02:54:10.560 --> 02:54:12.660]
and the rich folks hate the poor folks,

[02:54:12.900 --> 02:54:14.880]
all of my folks hate all of your folks.

[02:54:15.100 --> 02:54:16.720]
It's American as apple pie,

[02:54:16.900 --> 02:54:19.800]
but during national brotherhood week,

[02:54:20.680 --> 02:54:22.380]
national brotherhood week,

[02:54:22.740 --> 02:54:24.300]
New Yorkers love the poise

[02:54:24.300 --> 02:54:26.980]
and the cats or reekens cause it's very sheesh.

[02:54:27.000 --> 02:54:29.220]
Step up and shake the hand of

[02:54:29.220 --> 02:54:31.280]
someone you can't stand,

[02:54:31.540 --> 02:54:34.020]
you can tolerate him if you try.

[02:54:37.560 --> 02:54:39.780]
Older Protestants hate the Catholics,

[02:54:40.200 --> 02:54:42.260]
and the Catholics hate the Protestants,

[02:54:42.440 --> 02:54:44.180]
and the Hindus hate the Muslims,

[02:54:44.180 --> 02:54:46.260]
and everybody hates the Jews,

[02:54:46.460 --> 02:54:49.380]
but during the national brotherhood week,

[02:54:49.380 --> 02:54:51.640]

who are inferior to you.

[02:55:00.920 --> 02:55:04.420]
It's only four a week, so have no fear.

[02:55:05.200 --> 02:55:07.960]
Be grateful that it doesn't last for you.

[02:55:12.900 --> 02:55:15.280]
Woo! Hiya, Pally!

[02:55:15.820 --> 02:55:17.680]
I'm sorry, I've waited to see you in there.

[02:55:18.100 --> 02:55:20.420]
Don't look okay. I'm making you.

[02:55:20.420 --> 02:55:22.060]
You always close the door, will you?

[02:55:22.440 --> 02:55:23.640]
I can't.

[02:55:24.800 --> 02:55:26.980]
Don't go looking in the door.

[02:55:27.940 --> 02:55:30.380]
I spread my legs when I splatter.

[02:55:31.400 --> 02:55:33.280]
My cheeks are touching the floor.

[02:55:34.040 --> 02:55:36.500]
Don't want nobody to see me like that.

[02:55:37.520 --> 02:55:38.820]
I'm reading the paper.

[02:55:39.780 --> 02:55:41.240]
Then the handicaps door.

[02:55:42.060 --> 02:55:43.900]
Please don't come in.

[02:55:50.420 --> 02:55:51.940]
Beasts and gildies.

[02:55:52.360 --> 02:55:52.880]
Ah!

[02:55:53.620 --> 02:55:54.840]
Mark and Jo.

[02:55:55.920 --> 02:55:56.680]
Sorry.

[02:55:57.140 --> 02:55:58.420]
Who had come in?

[02:55:58.660 --> 02:55:59.600]
You're not gonna come in.

[02:55:59.980 --> 02:56:00.620]
You're not gonna come in today.

[02:56:00.820 --> 02:56:01.400]
I'm not.

[02:56:03.200 --> 02:56:04.600]
Reagan or Hay?

[02:56:05.040 --> 02:56:06.020]
That's disgusting.

[02:56:06.580 --> 02:56:07.700]
Mad George Jim.

[02:56:07.920 --> 02:56:08.700]
I am.

[02:56:08.980 --> 02:56:11.300]
I can't look the door.

[02:56:11.860 --> 02:56:14.760]
Because I can't see.

[02:56:19.400 --> 02:56:20.040]
I'm not.

[02:56:20.740 --> 02:56:21.380]
I'm not.

[02:56:21.380 --> 02:56:21.440]
I'm not.

[02:56:21.440 --> 02:56:22.820]
Don't go looking in the door.

[02:56:23.760 --> 02:56:25.940]
I'm dropping toys in the well.

[02:56:27.180 --> 02:56:28.520]
Please don't turn around.

[02:56:28.780 --> 02:56:29.460]
Try to ignore.

[02:56:30.880 --> 02:56:32.440]
I'm putting to do something.

[02:56:33.780 --> 02:56:34.960]
I'm in here making.

[02:56:35.980 --> 02:56:37.360]
With my pants on the floor.

[02:56:38.180 --> 02:56:39.780]
Next to my chin.

[02:56:39.780 --> 02:56:40.240]
Ooh.

[02:56:42.520 --> 02:56:42.760]
Ooh.

[02:56:43.080 --> 02:56:43.080]

[02:56:43.680 --> 02:56:43.740]
Huh?

[02:56:45.080 --> 02:56:45.680]
Damn.

[02:56:47.200 --> 02:56:48.320]
Finally done.

[02:56:50.940 --> 02:56:52.780]
Hey, my hand's all broke.

[02:56:54.080 --> 02:56:55.360]
The hand's all broke.

[02:56:56.420 --> 02:56:58.020]
My hand's all broken.

[02:56:59.220 --> 02:57:00.120]
It's not me.

[02:57:00.820 --> 02:57:02.420]
It's not me.

[02:57:03.160 --> 02:57:03.160]

[02:57:03.580 --> 02:57:04.820]
It's not me.

[02:57:05.340 --> 02:57:06.400]
What's gonna help me?

[02:57:07.400 --> 02:57:08.160]
It's not me.

[02:57:09.820 --> 02:57:10.460]
Harry.

[02:57:12.040 --> 02:57:13.320]
All right.

[02:57:13.740 --> 02:57:16.140]
Let's play who wants to be a millionaire.

[02:57:18.100 --> 02:57:19.140]
Pop daddy.

[02:57:19.820 --> 02:57:20.620]
Sitting in the chair.

[02:57:21.280 --> 02:57:22.020]
I'll call you Puffy.

[02:57:22.400 --> 02:57:23.040]
Yo, yo, man.

[02:57:23.180 --> 02:57:23.540]
Yo, yo.

[02:57:24.060 --> 02:57:24.580]
Are you ready?

[02:57:25.220 --> 02:57:25.420]
Yeah.

[02:57:26.000 --> 02:57:27.460]
Here's your $100 question.

[02:57:28.060 --> 02:57:29.820]
Finish this nursery rhyme.

[02:57:30.380 --> 02:57:30.680]
All right.

[02:57:31.060 --> 02:57:33.100]
Hickory, dickory, blank.

[02:57:33.620 --> 02:57:39.900]
Is it A-Doc, B-Pier, C-Marena, or D-Inlet?

[02:57:40.520 --> 02:57:41.700]
Whoa, man.

[02:57:42.160 --> 02:57:43.620]
Is $100 a question right here?

[02:57:43.860 --> 02:57:44.620]
You're kidding me, right?

[02:57:45.320 --> 02:57:45.960]
This is $100.

[02:57:46.640 --> 02:57:47.440]
For $100.

[02:57:47.960 --> 02:57:49.280]
This ain't the million dollar question.

[02:57:49.920 --> 02:57:51.000]
Well, this is the first one.

[02:57:51.740 --> 02:57:51.960]
Man.

[02:57:52.160 --> 02:57:53.000]
It's only for $100.

[02:57:53.440 --> 02:57:54.440]
Is this a black thing?

[02:57:54.780 --> 02:57:55.980]
Would you like to use a light one?

[02:57:56.340 --> 02:57:56.860]
Yeah, all right.

[02:57:56.940 --> 02:57:57.360]
What do I got?

[02:57:57.480 --> 02:57:57.880]
What do I got?

[02:57:58.360 --> 02:58:01.420]
Well, we have the ask the audience, the 50-50, and the phone a friend.

[02:58:01.420 --> 02:58:02.540]
Ask the audience.

[02:58:02.800 --> 02:58:04.340]
That's only white people in here.

[02:58:04.580 --> 02:58:06.040]
That 50-50 ain't gonna help me.

[02:58:06.200 --> 02:58:06.580]
Oh, you know what?

[02:58:06.640 --> 02:58:07.500]
I'm gonna phone a friend.

[02:58:07.860 --> 02:58:11.120]
I'm gonna phone a friend on the $100 question finishing the nursery rhyme.

[02:58:11.420 --> 02:58:11.760]
Yeah.

[02:58:12.420 --> 02:58:13.040]
All right.

[02:58:13.140 --> 02:58:13.920]
Who are we gonna call, Puffy?

[02:58:14.380 --> 02:58:14.960]
Oh, my boy.

[02:58:15.120 --> 02:58:16.120]
Old dirty bastard.

[02:58:17.020 --> 02:58:18.140]
Old dirty bastard.

[02:58:18.480 --> 02:58:19.780]
Yeah, dirty we call him.

[02:58:20.380 --> 02:58:23.360]
Our friends from AT&T will get old dirty on the line.

[02:58:23.800 --> 02:58:25.220]
And hopefully he can help you.

[02:58:27.740 --> 02:58:28.220]
Yo.

[02:58:28.920 --> 02:58:29.620]
Old dirty.

[02:58:30.260 --> 02:58:31.000]
Yeah, man.

[02:58:31.520 --> 02:58:33.820]
Registra Filman from who wants to be a millionaire.

[02:58:33.960 --> 02:58:34.600]
How are you?

[02:58:34.800 --> 02:58:37.120]
I got your friend here, Puff Daddy.

[02:58:37.460 --> 02:58:38.460]
Yo, dirty was that?

[02:58:38.700 --> 02:58:39.180]
Was that?

[02:58:39.920 --> 02:58:40.160]
Was that?

[02:58:41.580 --> 02:58:42.240]
Was that?

[02:58:42.920 --> 02:58:43.700]
Was that?

[02:58:43.700 --> 02:58:43.860]
Was that?

[02:58:43.940 --> 02:58:44.260]
All right.

[02:58:44.580 --> 02:58:44.740]
All right.

[02:58:45.900 --> 02:58:46.780]
Old dirty.

[02:58:47.080 --> 02:58:47.620]
Old dirty.

[02:58:48.480 --> 02:58:52.200]
Puff Daddy's in a little bit of trouble here on the $100 question.

[02:58:52.400 --> 02:58:54.100]
Hey, the first time, man.

[02:58:54.240 --> 02:58:55.000]
First question.

[02:58:55.560 --> 02:58:57.640]
And the next voice you hear will be his.

[02:58:57.720 --> 02:58:58.460]
He'll come on the line.

[02:58:58.580 --> 02:58:59.580]
He'll ask you the question.

[02:58:59.580 --> 02:59:01.680]
And he'll give you four possible choices.

[02:59:01.980 --> 02:59:02.400]
Are you set?

[02:59:02.800 --> 02:59:03.420]
Hey, man.

[02:59:03.940 --> 02:59:05.320]
Next voice you hear will be his.

[02:59:05.580 --> 02:59:07.800]
And 30 seconds begins now.

[02:59:08.200 --> 02:59:09.260]
Was that?

[02:59:10.440 --> 02:59:11.140]
Your dirty.

[02:59:11.360 --> 02:59:12.640]
Finish this off for me, all right?

[02:59:12.780 --> 02:59:13.300]
Hey, man.

[02:59:13.460 --> 02:59:15.580]
Pickering, dickering, blank.

[02:59:16.100 --> 02:59:18.820]
Is it A-Doc?

[02:59:19.420 --> 02:59:23.640]
B-P-R-C-Morino?

[02:59:24.280 --> 02:59:26.760]
Or D-Illit?

[02:59:27.280 --> 02:59:28.640]
Oh, oh.

[02:59:28.640 --> 02:59:29.500]
Come on, man.

[02:59:29.560 --> 02:59:30.360]
I don't got much time.

[02:59:30.400 --> 02:59:31.320]
I know this, man.

[02:59:31.480 --> 02:59:31.980]
I know it.

[02:59:32.080 --> 02:59:32.880]
I see his pier.

[02:59:33.440 --> 02:59:34.080]
P, you sure?

[02:59:34.640 --> 02:59:35.940]
About... about 30, man.

[02:59:36.180 --> 02:59:37.180]
There's a lot of money, man.

[02:59:37.400 --> 02:59:38.140]
About 30.

[02:59:38.380 --> 02:59:38.840]
All right, man.

[02:59:38.980 --> 02:59:39.640]
Thank you very much.

[02:59:39.860 --> 02:59:40.540]
All right, man.

[02:59:41.280 --> 02:59:42.820]
Times off, uh, old dirty.

[02:59:43.220 --> 02:59:43.800]
Said pier.

[02:59:44.320 --> 02:59:44.680]
Whew.

[02:59:45.020 --> 02:59:46.500]
You still have two lifelines left.

[02:59:46.780 --> 02:59:48.280]
We are on the $100 question.

[02:59:48.740 --> 02:59:49.500]
You know what, Regis?

[02:59:49.660 --> 02:59:50.540]
Want to poll the audience?

[02:59:50.900 --> 02:59:52.420]
No, I like to add it, I find.

[02:59:53.240 --> 02:59:53.880]
Actually, no.

[02:59:53.940 --> 02:59:55.580]
There's only, uh, three lifelines.

[02:59:55.580 --> 02:59:56.260]
You've used one.

[02:59:56.340 --> 02:59:56.940]
You have two left.

[02:59:56.940 --> 02:59:57.540]
No, no, no.

[02:59:57.860 --> 02:59:59.240]
I get another lifeline.

[02:59:59.620 --> 03:00:01.060]
It's a brand new one to the game.

[03:00:01.640 --> 03:00:02.020]
Uh, no.

[03:00:02.220 --> 03:00:02.920]
What is that, Puffy?

[03:00:03.260 --> 03:00:04.300]
It's called Shoot the Host.

[03:00:04.920 --> 03:00:06.220]
Puffy, you can ask the audience.

[03:00:06.540 --> 03:00:07.660]
I call it Shoot the Host.

[03:00:07.840 --> 03:00:09.000]
Puffy, use the 50-50.

[03:00:09.200 --> 03:00:09.780]
What's the answer?

[03:00:10.000 --> 03:00:11.320]
Puffy, it's Dark, it's A.

[03:00:11.740 --> 03:00:12.220]
It's Dark.

[03:00:12.440 --> 03:00:13.440]
My final answer is Dark.

[03:00:13.580 --> 03:00:14.020]
It's Dark.

[03:00:14.340 --> 03:00:15.180]
And it's a good one.

[03:00:15.300 --> 03:00:16.140]
You got a hundred dollars.

[03:00:16.540 --> 03:00:17.740]
Run, you run, you white bull!

[03:00:17.900 --> 03:00:18.460]
Run, Sheldon!

[03:00:18.780 --> 03:00:20.200]
Run, you white bull!

[03:00:32.240 --> 03:00:37.540]
Run, you white bull!

[03:00:38.020 --> 03:00:38.060]
Run, you white bull!

[03:00:38.060 --> 03:00:38.060]

[03:00:38.060 --> 03:00:38.060]

[03:00:38.060 --> 03:00:38.060]

[03:00:38.060 --> 03:00:38.060]

[03:00:38.060 --> 03:00:38.060]

[03:00:38.060 --> 03:00:38.060]

[03:00:38.060 --> 03:00:38.060]

[03:00:38.060 --> 03:00:38.060]

[03:00:38.060 --> 03:00:38.060]

[03:00:38.060 --> 03:00:38.060]

[03:00:38.060 --> 03:00:38.060]

[03:00:38.060 --> 03:00:38.880]
Run, you white bull!

[03:00:38.880 --> 03:00:38.880]

[03:00:38.880 --> 03:00:40.460]
Run, you white bull!

[03:00:40.460 --> 03:00:43.220]
Run, you white bull!

[03:00:43.220 --> 03:00:44.940]
Run, you white bull!

[03:00:44.940 --> 03:00:45.040]
Run, you white bull!

[03:00:45.040 --> 03:00:46.640]
Run, you white bull!

[03:00:46.640 --> 03:00:48.760]
Run, you white bull!

[03:00:49.180 --> 03:00:49.620]
Run, you white bull!

[03:00:50.560 --> 03:00:55.480]
Run, you white bull!

[03:00:55.480 --> 03:00:55.960]
Run, you white bull!

[03:00:55.960 --> 03:00:56.920]
Run, you white bull!

[03:00:56.920 --> 03:00:56.920]

[03:00:56.920 --> 03:00:56.920]

[03:00:59.460 --> 03:01:01.080]
The lines are jammed up.

[03:01:01.320 --> 03:01:02.660]
Yeah, there isn't a doubt.

[03:01:03.720 --> 03:01:06.540]
Call up and tell me what it's all about.

[03:01:07.120 --> 03:01:08.080]
I got you down.

[03:01:09.800 --> 03:01:11.240]
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[03:01:11.600 --> 03:01:12.340]
Holy cow.

[03:01:15.700 --> 03:01:19.200]
I'll tell you once more before I hang up the phone.

[03:01:19.940 --> 03:01:20.620]
I got you down.

[03:01:23.800 --> 03:01:24.980]
I got you down.

[03:01:26.340 --> 03:01:26.900]
I got you down.

[03:01:28.100 --> 03:01:29.320]
I got you down.

[03:01:31.680 --> 03:01:33.060]
I got you down.

[03:01:35.900 --> 03:01:37.180]
I got you down.

[03:01:41.080 --> 03:01:44.600]
Here on the show, there's a new topic each night.

[03:01:45.620 --> 03:01:48.660]
Who'd you have sex with with a black or with a white?

[03:01:49.120 --> 03:01:49.780]
I got you down.

[03:01:51.300 --> 03:01:52.860]
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[03:01:53.300 --> 03:01:53.900]
Holy cow.

[03:01:57.320 --> 03:02:00.840]
I'll tell you once more before I hang up the phone.

[03:02:01.100 --> 03:02:02.580]
I got you down.

[03:02:03.020 --> 03:02:05.780]
Oh my God, I feel so good.

[03:02:06.100 --> 03:02:07.300]
Oh yeah, oh yeah.

[03:02:07.300 --> 03:02:08.980]
Oh, I'm sure you're going to be.

[03:02:08.980 --> 03:02:10.800]
Oh yeah, who's your daddy?

[03:02:11.260 --> 03:02:12.400]
Who's your daddy?

[03:02:13.500 --> 03:02:14.780]
Oh my God.

[03:02:15.380 --> 03:02:16.660]
Oh, you're close, my boss.

[03:02:16.960 --> 03:02:18.080]
Play with my boss.

[03:02:18.820 --> 03:02:21.020]
Oh, I feel so good.

[03:02:22.020 --> 03:02:23.180]
I'm just around number one.

[03:02:23.480 --> 03:02:25.380]
There's a ton of people.

[03:02:25.380 --> 03:02:27.700]
Oh my God, what are you doing?

[03:02:28.240 --> 03:02:29.000]
I'm just running.

[03:02:29.820 --> 03:02:29.960]
Hey!

[03:02:34.620 --> 03:02:35.820]
What else?

[03:02:36.360 --> 03:02:37.800]
I'll be to a tower.

[03:02:42.600 --> 03:02:44.700]
When I was hung like a gold.

[03:02:45.300 --> 03:02:46.320]
Like a gold.

[03:02:46.760 --> 03:02:47.960]
Like my political, my name.

[03:02:49.500 --> 03:02:51.960]
She said, for her he blew you.

[03:02:52.560 --> 03:02:54.400]
You got a look for you.

[03:02:54.760 --> 03:02:56.020]
I said, for you.

[03:02:56.220 --> 03:02:58.640]
She called the circle the size of four and look of size.

[03:02:59.140 --> 03:03:02.500]
He grabbed my human, gave a blade, a swing.

[03:03:02.900 --> 03:03:04.560]
And then he cut me.

[03:03:05.240 --> 03:03:06.180]
He cut me.

[03:03:07.140 --> 03:03:12.520]
I used to be real and leave a bow on home like an axe.

[03:03:13.880 --> 03:03:18.340]
I was bigger than that until the rabbi caught me.

[03:03:18.620 --> 03:03:20.940]
He cut me, cut me, cut me, cut me.

[03:03:22.040 --> 03:03:24.740]
Try to find a Jew that's how you do.

[03:03:25.060 --> 03:03:27.200]
That's how you're supposed to know me one.

[03:03:27.640 --> 03:03:28.780]
The only one.

[03:03:29.160 --> 03:03:31.520]
Because of your he blew you.

[03:03:31.680 --> 03:03:33.640]
He can be hung of your Jew.

[03:03:34.200 --> 03:03:35.320]
He hung of your old Jew.

[03:03:35.520 --> 03:03:37.000]
And my police, I'm still on.

[03:03:37.200 --> 03:03:38.640]
The police, I still are.

[03:03:38.820 --> 03:03:41.640]
My religious humanity.

[03:03:41.640 --> 03:03:43.720]
He had the rabbi cut me.

[03:03:44.280 --> 03:03:45.360]
He cut me.

[03:03:46.160 --> 03:03:48.700]
I say, please don't cut me.

[03:03:48.880 --> 03:03:49.540]
Don't worry.

[03:03:50.040 --> 03:03:51.620]
Oh, like a nut.

[03:03:53.060 --> 03:03:55.840]
Help me try to grow without taking a hand.

[03:03:56.080 --> 03:03:58.300]
And not be home like an athlete.

[03:03:58.840 --> 03:04:00.000]
Rub me, rub me, rub me.

[03:04:00.120 --> 03:04:02.800]
Rub me, rub me.

[03:04:03.020 --> 03:04:03.280]
Rub me, rub me.

[03:04:03.360 --> 03:04:05.380]
Rub me, rub me.

[03:04:05.380 --> 03:04:06.280]
Rub me, rub me.

[03:04:06.280 --> 03:04:06.660]
Rub me, rub me.

[03:04:06.680 --> 03:04:07.940]
Oh, like a nut.

[03:04:08.400 --> 03:04:09.300]
Yes, please.

[03:04:09.300 --> 03:04:11.240]
Oh, like a nut.

[03:04:26.760 --> 03:04:28.680]
Yes, please.

[03:04:29.220 --> 03:04:30.700]
Oh, like a nut.

[03:04:30.720 --> 03:04:31.340]
Yes, please.

[03:04:32.140 --> 03:04:34.000]
Oh, like a nut.

[03:04:40.300 --> 03:04:42.300]
Hey baby, wanna do?

[03:04:42.980 --> 03:04:45.040]
Yeah, hop into my Lincoln.

[03:04:45.320 --> 03:04:47.360]
Oh, it's a nice car, baby.

[03:04:47.800 --> 03:04:48.900]
You bet your ass, baby.

[03:04:49.180 --> 03:04:50.780]
Yo, T-Bow, man, do the time.

[03:04:51.060 --> 03:04:51.980]
Oh, yeah, man.

[03:04:52.340 --> 03:04:53.040]
Oh, okay, man.

[03:04:53.420 --> 03:04:54.280]
Hey, what's that?

[03:04:54.880 --> 03:04:55.520]
It's nothing.

[03:04:55.760 --> 03:04:57.000]
It's a dog.

[03:04:57.360 --> 03:04:59.500]
Oh, no, man, it's a little bit far, man.

[03:04:59.820 --> 03:05:01.020]
It's a little bit far, man.

[03:05:01.580 --> 03:05:03.980]
It's a little bit far, man.

[03:05:03.980 --> 03:05:07.040]
It's Barbie with all the fly accessories.

[03:05:07.840 --> 03:05:09.200]
Fish and head stockings.

[03:05:09.620 --> 03:05:11.180]
Three in-spite heels.

[03:05:11.760 --> 03:05:13.620]
Genuine needle marks on the arm.

[03:05:13.960 --> 03:05:14.980]
And removable teeth.

[03:05:15.680 --> 03:05:17.320]
Oh, man, yo, yo, yo, check it.

[03:05:17.500 --> 03:05:19.120]
Oh, look out for your teeth, miss.

[03:05:19.380 --> 03:05:22.740]
I put on a red finisher, and I slapped the roof all week on the bits.

[03:05:23.100 --> 03:05:24.080]
Boy, yeah, man.

[03:05:24.440 --> 03:05:26.000]
That bitch is down, T.

[03:05:26.340 --> 03:05:26.800]
Oh, man.

[03:05:27.160 --> 03:05:28.300]
Take off that finisher, miss.

[03:05:28.960 --> 03:05:30.240]
Hooker, bitch, Barbie.

[03:05:30.240 --> 03:05:33.880]
And coming soon, Andre the talking pig.

[03:05:34.340 --> 03:05:34.620]
What?

[03:05:35.140 --> 03:05:37.280]
Bitch, get your ass in the car.

[03:05:37.680 --> 03:05:38.880]
I said, put it down.

[03:05:48.540 --> 03:05:50.260]
Run along to the gate square.

[03:05:50.420 --> 03:05:52.560]
And it's got a great big zipper in the back of my pants.

[03:05:52.860 --> 03:05:54.460]
Get off the horse at the old barn door.

[03:05:54.460 --> 03:05:55.480]
Got my saddle burned around.

[03:05:55.640 --> 03:05:56.520]
I'm arriving on the horn.

[03:06:00.420 --> 03:06:02.480]
Look inside, poster dancing all around.

[03:06:02.760 --> 03:06:04.360]
There goes Johnny and his mother's night gown.

[03:06:04.720 --> 03:06:06.320]
All the man left and all the man right.

[03:06:06.680 --> 03:06:08.260]
All the man needs his appellation fight.

[03:06:13.180 --> 03:06:15.280]
Give your partner a silly smirk.

[03:06:15.600 --> 03:06:17.200]
All going hands for a big circle jerk.

[03:06:17.660 --> 03:06:19.200]
Volunteers all raise your hand.

[03:06:19.460 --> 03:06:21.160]
Who's going to be the next pivot man?

[03:06:26.120 --> 03:06:28.060]
Invatch your partner home for a drink.

[03:06:28.380 --> 03:06:31.920]
Lick your lits and give him a wink with a great big smile and a great big nod.

[03:06:32.300 --> 03:06:34.240]
Let him know your gerbil's beclawed.

[03:06:35.220 --> 03:06:38.180]
Getting a head start in learning is very important for your child.

[03:06:38.420 --> 03:06:40.500]
No matter what language your school system recognizes.

[03:06:40.760 --> 03:06:42.140]
Class repeat after me.

[03:06:44.040 --> 03:06:44.520]
AEIOU.

[03:06:44.740 --> 03:06:49.780]
And if your school system endorses black English, then getting that head start means getting hooked on ebonyx.

[03:06:49.780 --> 03:06:51.400]
Class repeat after me.

[03:06:52.920 --> 03:06:53.420]
AEIOU.

[03:06:54.060 --> 03:06:59.340]
Hooked on ebonyx teaches your child the intricacies of this new language through direct comparison with regular English.

[03:06:59.580 --> 03:07:00.200]
Just listen.

[03:07:00.300 --> 03:07:01.480]
Can I please have a cookie?

[03:07:01.680 --> 03:07:03.400]
Good. Now try it in ebonyx.

[03:07:03.540 --> 03:07:05.520]
Give me the damn cookie bits.

[03:07:05.800 --> 03:07:06.960]
Very good to me.

[03:07:07.080 --> 03:07:13.880]
Hooked on ebonyx is the learn-of-home language system that will have your bright young preschooler talking like a violent gang member in just six short weeks.

[03:07:14.280 --> 03:07:15.280]
He'll learn the double negatives.

[03:07:15.500 --> 03:07:16.600]
I know, fuck them.

[03:07:16.600 --> 03:07:17.400]
The excess plural.

[03:07:17.400 --> 03:07:19.040]
No, no, no, no, that's what it reminds.

[03:07:19.560 --> 03:07:21.060]
And the proper way to pose an inquiry.

[03:07:21.200 --> 03:07:23.120]
Yeah, let me ask you a question.

[03:07:23.300 --> 03:07:24.760]
Hooked on ebonyx. Order today.

[03:07:25.060 --> 03:07:26.720]
And by the time your child is ready for school.

[03:07:26.940 --> 03:07:28.980]
Hey, go into no dance school.

[03:07:29.080 --> 03:07:33.000]
He'll be ready to drop out. That's our guarantee. Hooked on ebonyx.

[03:07:33.080 --> 03:07:35.040]
Hooked on ebonyx is not endorsed by anyone in the right mind.

[03:08:05.520 --> 03:08:10.840]
You come onto me and whisper things in my ear.

[03:08:11.160 --> 03:08:14.280]
It sounds so odd.

[03:08:14.980 --> 03:08:18.940]
But if you want to tell me, you're slow.

[03:08:19.980 --> 03:08:22.700]
There's things about me that I don't think you know.

[03:08:24.300 --> 03:08:25.820]
I'm underage.

[03:08:27.120 --> 03:08:31.160]
I said and jean, you should be scared of me.

[03:08:31.160 --> 03:08:36.120]
Cause you forgot that she lived for sweet when he.

[03:08:37.320 --> 03:08:41.520]
If I sweet, you would have breathed and made.

[03:08:42.480 --> 03:08:46.320]
She was 25 but she's just a teen.

[03:08:47.480 --> 03:08:51.360]
Perfectee. I've been my last sweet.

[03:08:52.720 --> 03:08:54.940]
Daddy called me a cop last night.

[03:08:55.240 --> 03:08:57.680]
So my rest got perfect to see.

[03:08:57.680 --> 03:09:00.700]
Because I'll have such a ring.

[03:09:00.940 --> 03:09:04.620]
None of my skirts teach my needs.

[03:09:05.240 --> 03:09:10.660]
And I but just think right out of my show.

[03:09:11.440 --> 03:09:12.880]
She's underage.

[03:09:13.140 --> 03:09:13.920]
She'll think.

[03:09:14.580 --> 03:09:18.760]
First 25, you should be scared of her.

[03:09:19.320 --> 03:09:19.560]
Yeah.

[03:09:19.860 --> 03:09:23.960]
And rolling stones, breath made of a dynamite.

[03:09:26.440 --> 03:09:29.140]
She's looking right by.

[03:09:29.920 --> 03:09:33.900]
She was 25 but she's just a teen.

[03:09:35.880 --> 03:09:36.860]
I did this for me.

[03:09:36.940 --> 03:09:38.360]
Maybe we changed into the world of my Tyson.

[03:09:38.740 --> 03:09:43.040]
We got to be little words for the day.

[03:09:43.600 --> 03:09:44.560]
The world is pin of code.

[03:09:45.260 --> 03:09:45.860]
Pin of code.

[03:09:46.420 --> 03:09:48.500]
In the middle of the time, my pin of show gets cold.

[03:09:48.860 --> 03:09:49.280]
Don't be done.

[03:09:49.660 --> 03:09:50.080]
Don't be done.

[03:09:50.080 --> 03:09:51.580]
I'll be back kids.

[03:09:52.340 --> 03:09:53.800]
Oh, goodness.

[03:09:55.420 --> 03:09:57.560]
Do I gotta go?

[03:09:57.560 --> 03:09:59.320]
Do I gotta go?

[03:09:59.320 --> 03:10:01.000]
Oh, I don't have a pants.

[03:10:01.940 --> 03:10:02.800]
Oh, oh.

[03:10:05.900 --> 03:10:06.380]
Hey.

[03:10:16.420 --> 03:10:17.300]
Oh.

[03:10:17.760 --> 03:10:18.500]
Oh.

[03:10:18.780 --> 03:10:18.780]

[03:10:26.720 --> 03:10:29.020]
I'm in here.

[03:10:29.260 --> 03:10:30.800]
I'm in here.

[03:10:31.460 --> 03:10:34.060]
Missy right now.

[03:10:35.840 --> 03:10:36.480]
Oh.

[03:10:38.960 --> 03:10:40.780]
Farnie.

[03:10:42.160 --> 03:10:42.960]
Farnie.

[03:10:44.360 --> 03:10:46.060]
Farnie.

[03:10:46.060 --> 03:10:48.200]
We just wait a minute.

[03:10:48.660 --> 03:10:49.080]
Eee.

[03:10:53.040 --> 03:10:58.080]
Oh, that was stupid.

[03:10:58.340 --> 03:11:01.520]
Oh, here comes another one.

[03:11:03.080 --> 03:11:05.340]
Wait, I'm in sort of butt there.

[03:11:06.980 --> 03:11:07.580]
Coming.

[03:11:08.120 --> 03:11:08.880]
Here come kids.

[03:11:11.100 --> 03:11:12.220]
Roll another one.

[03:11:15.880 --> 03:11:16.840]
Okay.

[03:11:31.360 --> 03:11:36.140]
I was gonna clean my room until I got on.

[03:11:37.760 --> 03:11:40.380]
I was gonna get up and find the broom.

[03:11:40.880 --> 03:11:41.980]
But then I got hot.

[03:11:43.320 --> 03:11:44.740]
Loud at my room.

[03:11:45.040 --> 03:11:46.260]
Still messed up.

[03:11:46.620 --> 03:11:48.320]
And I know why, why, man.

[03:11:48.740 --> 03:11:49.380]
Yeah, yeah.

[03:11:49.560 --> 03:11:50.380]
Yeah, cuz I got hot.

[03:11:50.800 --> 03:11:51.920]
Yeah, cuz I got hot.

[03:11:52.360 --> 03:11:53.460]
Yeah, cuz I got hot.

[03:11:54.220 --> 03:11:55.120]
Loud at hot.

[03:11:55.780 --> 03:11:59.120]
I was gonna go to class before I got hot.

[03:11:59.400 --> 03:12:00.060]
Come on, yo.

[03:12:00.100 --> 03:12:00.620]
Check it out.

[03:12:01.000 --> 03:12:03.560]
I could have cheated and I could have passed.

[03:12:03.560 --> 03:12:05.100]
But I got hot.

[03:12:06.160 --> 03:12:07.660]
Loud at my room.

[03:12:07.660 --> 03:12:09.500]
I'm taking a next semester.

[03:12:09.780 --> 03:12:11.480]
And I know why, why, why, why.

[03:12:11.760 --> 03:12:13.800]
Yeah, cuz I got hot.

[03:12:14.060 --> 03:12:15.260]
Yeah, cuz I got hot.

[03:12:15.520 --> 03:12:16.460]
Yeah, cuz I got hot.

[03:12:16.740 --> 03:12:22.180]
Yeah, cuz I got hot.

[03:12:23.960 --> 03:12:26.520]
I was gonna pay my child support.

[03:12:27.060 --> 03:12:28.120]
But then I got hot.

[03:12:28.280 --> 03:12:28.700]
No, you what?

[03:12:28.700 --> 03:12:29.940]
They did it loud.

[03:12:30.300 --> 03:12:32.240]
I think of my whole paycheck.

[03:12:32.400 --> 03:12:34.680]
And I know why, why, me.

[03:12:35.200 --> 03:12:35.300]
Yeah.

[03:12:35.440 --> 03:12:36.840]
Cuz I got hot.

[03:12:37.180 --> 03:12:37.760]
They do it loud.

[03:12:38.540 --> 03:12:40.140]
They do it loud loud.

[03:12:40.400 --> 03:12:41.560]
Loud at that.

[03:12:42.020 --> 03:12:43.920]
I wasn't gonna run from the cops.

[03:12:44.340 --> 03:12:45.340]
But I was hot.

[03:12:45.760 --> 03:12:46.920]
I'm serious man.

[03:12:47.560 --> 03:12:49.700]
I was gonna pull right over and stop.

[03:12:50.180 --> 03:12:51.300]
But I was hot.

[03:12:52.520 --> 03:12:53.780]
Loud I got hot.

[03:12:53.940 --> 03:12:55.220]
Now I'm a peerup.

[03:12:55.340 --> 03:12:56.160]
Please check in.

[03:13:04.940 --> 03:13:05.520]
And now I'm...

[03:13:05.520 --> 03:13:05.520]

[03:13:05.520 --> 03:13:07.180]
I was gonna make love to you

[03:13:07.180 --> 03:13:08.780]
Oh, did I got a heart?

[03:13:08.860 --> 03:13:09.400]
Oh, what should I say?

[03:13:09.400 --> 03:13:09.860]
I'm sorry

[03:13:09.860 --> 03:13:15.320]
Oh, did I got a heart?

[03:13:18.300 --> 03:13:18.880]
Yeah

[03:13:23.620 --> 03:13:24.200]
Egooo

[03:13:24.200 --> 03:13:25.360]
Sibuuu

[03:13:28.020 --> 03:13:30.380]
I miss my entire life

[03:13:30.380 --> 03:13:31.800]
Yeah, because I got high

[03:13:31.800 --> 03:13:36.280]
Yeah, lost my keys and white

[03:13:36.280 --> 03:13:37.580]
Because I got high

[03:13:37.580 --> 03:13:39.700]
Say what, say what, say what, say what

[03:13:39.700 --> 03:13:41.900]
Now I'm sleeping on the sidewalk

[03:13:41.900 --> 03:13:44.120]
And I know why, why me

[03:13:44.120 --> 03:13:46.260]
Yeah, hey, because I got high

[03:13:46.260 --> 03:13:48.000]
Because I got high

[03:13:48.000 --> 03:13:49.880]
Because I got high

[03:13:51.480 --> 03:13:53.300]
I'm a stop singing the song

[03:13:53.300 --> 03:13:54.760]
Because I'm high

[03:13:56.800 --> 03:13:59.260]
I'm singing this whole thing wrong

[03:13:59.260 --> 03:14:00.720]
Yeah, because I'm high

[03:14:00.720 --> 03:14:02.840]
Bring it back, bring it back, come on

[03:14:02.840 --> 03:14:05.080]
And if I don't still want to copy

[03:14:05.080 --> 03:14:07.300]
I'm a wild, why me

[03:14:07.300 --> 03:14:09.280]
Yeah, hey, because I'm high

[03:14:09.280 --> 03:14:10.760]
Because I'm high

[03:14:11.300 --> 03:14:12.320]
Because I'm high

[03:14:12.320 --> 03:14:13.180]
Are you real?

[03:14:13.180 --> 03:14:14.340]
Yeah, I don't matter

[03:14:16.860 --> 03:14:18.840]
He really is high

[03:14:18.840 --> 03:14:21.320]
You should be real, why me

[03:14:22.220 --> 03:14:22.940]
I'm a wild, why me

[03:14:22.940 --> 03:14:25.140]
Would you fear your nephew is in hell?

[03:14:26.960 --> 03:14:28.600]
I feel that my nephew

[03:14:29.360 --> 03:14:31.300]
is not with the Lord at no

[03:14:31.880 --> 03:14:33.720]
Not with the Lord, in other words in hell

[03:14:33.720 --> 03:14:35.740]
I don't know, I feel no one alone

[03:14:35.740 --> 03:14:37.960]
No one can be cause a

[03:14:37.960 --> 03:14:39.200]
He can't

[03:14:39.200 --> 03:14:41.500]
cause his body is like a limo

[03:14:42.060 --> 03:14:43.700]
You fear that that Roman Catholic

[03:14:43.700 --> 03:14:45.540]
Communionist, they ate your nephew's body

[03:14:45.540 --> 03:14:46.580]
Yes, sir

[03:14:46.580 --> 03:14:48.860]
All right, we have on the line in Van Aes here

[03:14:49.480 --> 03:14:52.040]
Roman Catholic priest on KFI in 640, hello

[03:14:52.040 --> 03:14:53.220]
How you doing? Good

[03:14:54.640 --> 03:14:57.100]
First of all, I put my condolences to you

[03:14:57.100 --> 03:14:58.240]
on the line with your nephew

[03:14:58.240 --> 03:15:00.140]
Are you a priest? Yes, I am

[03:15:00.660 --> 03:15:03.180]
Okay, so I just want to let you

[03:15:03.180 --> 03:15:04.780]
press by something for you, okay?

[03:15:05.360 --> 03:15:06.420]
Yes, sir, this is just

[03:15:06.420 --> 03:15:07.920]
you've been missing form about

[03:15:07.920 --> 03:15:09.220]
the Catholic Church

[03:15:10.500 --> 03:15:12.920]
What if you just hang on on explain to what I believe

[03:15:12.920 --> 03:15:14.500]
and then you can draw your own conclusion

[03:15:14.500 --> 03:15:15.300]
Are you a priest?

[03:15:15.780 --> 03:15:17.460]
Release me from teaching it

[03:15:17.460 --> 03:15:18.440]
and you draw your own conclusion

[03:15:18.440 --> 03:15:20.480]
Let the father explain, okay?

[03:15:20.900 --> 03:15:23.080]
Okay, first of all, we believe that

[03:15:23.080 --> 03:15:24.060]
when we see communion

[03:15:24.600 --> 03:15:27.460]
we receive the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ

[03:15:27.460 --> 03:15:28.940]
Oh, to my God

[03:15:28.940 --> 03:15:30.600]
Well, hold on, man, I mean

[03:15:30.600 --> 03:15:33.100]
I'm just calling to let you know what I believe is

[03:15:33.100 --> 03:15:34.380]
You eat flesh and blood

[03:15:34.380 --> 03:15:36.420]
If you want to look at it, that way that's fine

[03:15:36.420 --> 03:15:38.320]
Oh, my God, I want to find

[03:15:38.320 --> 03:15:41.160]
This is our belief and you draw your own conclusion

[03:15:41.160 --> 03:15:41.820]
I want to find

[03:15:42.460 --> 03:15:44.380]
Now, you've got to let the father explain

[03:15:45.460 --> 03:15:47.920]
Well, when I want to hear you talk about it

[03:15:47.920 --> 03:15:49.340]
What if he doesn't listen from?

[03:15:49.740 --> 03:15:52.960]
This is our hell-raiser, like Clive Parker's young man

[03:15:52.960 --> 03:15:55.680]
Okay, the young sir, because you've been missing form about

[03:15:55.680 --> 03:15:58.280]
What happens to your nephew and I will tell you

[03:15:58.280 --> 03:16:00.840]
You eat the butt, you eat the whole damn thing

[03:16:01.720 --> 03:16:04.240]
Excuse me? Don't you eat it?

[03:16:04.260 --> 03:16:05.280]
We eat the host, yeah

[03:16:05.280 --> 03:16:05.940]
The host?

[03:16:06.140 --> 03:16:08.640]
But he sees the whole body of the man

[03:16:09.560 --> 03:16:10.540]
That's not what I said

[03:16:10.540 --> 03:16:13.040]
You said you eat the blood and the flesh

[03:16:13.040 --> 03:16:13.640]
Of whom?

[03:16:14.120 --> 03:16:15.000]
On the man?

[03:16:15.400 --> 03:16:16.640]
No, on Jesus Christ

[03:16:16.640 --> 03:16:19.380]
Oh, God, that is a blasphemy

[03:16:19.380 --> 03:16:21.220]
Well, if you choose to believe that

[03:16:21.980 --> 03:16:24.140]
I'm trying to do it until you're not by belief

[03:16:24.140 --> 03:16:25.900]
So you need to take it to the religion form

[03:16:25.900 --> 03:16:28.240]
Do you eat up on the booty too?

[03:16:28.660 --> 03:16:29.640]
I'm not going to answer that

[03:16:29.640 --> 03:16:31.460]
I don't understand what that means

[03:16:31.460 --> 03:16:34.880]
What does this man talk about eating the Lord Jesus?

[03:16:35.720 --> 03:16:36.360]
Let him finish

[03:16:36.360 --> 03:16:38.320]
Let him just say what he has to say

[03:16:38.320 --> 03:16:40.480]
The scriptures man, where Jesus took bread

[03:16:40.480 --> 03:16:42.280]
And blessed and broken and said

[03:16:42.280 --> 03:16:44.100]
Take this and eat it

[03:16:44.100 --> 03:16:45.320]
This is my body

[03:16:45.320 --> 03:16:47.720]
And then he said the cup of wine he said

[03:16:47.720 --> 03:16:49.720]
Take and drink this is my blood

[03:16:50.320 --> 03:16:52.600]
And again he said, I'm going to eat my body

[03:16:52.600 --> 03:16:54.580]
And drink my blood and I'm going to write the name

[03:16:54.580 --> 03:16:55.520]
Oh my God

[03:16:56.420 --> 03:16:57.920]
This is good Friday

[03:16:57.920 --> 03:17:00.760]
Exactly, and you're talking about eating up on Jesus

[03:17:01.460 --> 03:17:02.640]
I'm going to tell you that

[03:17:02.640 --> 03:17:03.660]
For me what we believe

[03:17:03.660 --> 03:17:05.440]
You grab it on Jesus, ain't you?

[03:17:05.440 --> 03:17:06.100]
You want?

[03:17:06.660 --> 03:17:08.340]
Grab it all over on Jesus

[03:17:08.340 --> 03:17:09.720]
If I think you choose to believe

[03:17:09.720 --> 03:17:11.720]
And my nephew, what about him?

[03:17:12.180 --> 03:17:13.260]
Okay man, I'm again

[03:17:13.260 --> 03:17:14.400]
I'm back on Jesus

[03:17:14.400 --> 03:17:23.820]
Then Catholics, Matt, done your boy

[03:17:23.820 --> 03:17:25.680]
You want to laugh on the floor?

[03:17:25.960 --> 03:17:26.740]
You want to laugh on the floor?

[03:17:26.740 --> 03:17:27.980]
You want to laugh on the floor?

[03:17:28.100 --> 03:17:29.020]
You want to laugh on the floor?

[03:17:29.420 --> 03:17:33.060]
I'll tell you

[03:17:33.060 --> 03:17:34.660]
Listen to me

[03:17:34.660 --> 03:17:38.720]
It's like a brother best homie

[03:17:41.680 --> 03:17:44.340]
Listen father, I thank you for taking the time

[03:17:44.340 --> 03:17:45.540]
I really do

[03:17:45.540 --> 03:17:46.840]
How are you? I'm your good Easter

[03:17:46.840 --> 03:17:49.800]
You pay for your sins

[03:17:49.800 --> 03:17:50.980]
Well, only better to die

[03:17:50.980 --> 03:17:52.320]
That's true, thanks father

[03:17:52.320 --> 03:17:55.220]
That was a Roman Catholic priest

[03:17:55.220 --> 03:17:58.000]
They're making on my boy like a brother best friend

[03:17:58.000 --> 03:17:59.620]
Oh, you can eat me

[03:18:06.900 --> 03:18:07.620]
What was it?

[03:18:13.180 --> 03:18:14.120]
What's it called man?

[03:18:14.740 --> 03:18:16.260]
Oh, you could eat me, bro

[03:18:17.160 --> 03:18:28.060]
Oh, you could eat me, bro

[03:18:46.620 --> 03:18:51.520]
Oh, you could eat me, bro

[03:18:52.060 --> 03:18:53.660]
Oh, God

[03:18:55.520 --> 03:18:56.900]
So, I understand

[03:19:23.660 --> 03:19:26.900]
Has that sonny love been retarded?

[03:19:27.220 --> 03:19:30.380]
Voice of bombers the wrong way

[03:19:33.280 --> 03:19:36.860]
And oven barons can be in America

[03:19:37.660 --> 03:19:40.820]
Where they follow books like cheese

[03:19:40.820 --> 03:19:43.880]
The United States of arrogance

[03:19:43.880 --> 03:19:46.300]
And by Bush and his family

[03:19:46.300 --> 03:19:48.340]
We beg of this country

[03:19:48.340 --> 03:19:52.240]
Of the humbling torque the largest maze

[03:19:52.240 --> 03:19:53.660]
And I disagree

[03:19:54.340 --> 03:19:57.700]
I don't want to be a Pax America

[03:19:59.380 --> 03:20:02.200]
In the goddamn USA

[03:20:07.240 --> 03:20:10.880]
What's a few thousand innocent lives

[03:20:12.340 --> 03:20:13.600]
Stop living it the last

[03:20:13.600 --> 03:20:18.020]
If you want that SUV to drive

[03:20:18.020 --> 03:20:20.700]
You're gonna need more gas

[03:20:21.600 --> 03:20:25.000]
It's the greatest country in the world

[03:20:25.600 --> 03:20:27.200]
They train us to believe

[03:20:27.200 --> 03:20:31.300]
And anyone who says that obviously

[03:20:31.300 --> 03:20:36.220]
And so forth to lead

[03:20:37.560 --> 03:20:41.300]
And oven barons to be in America

[03:20:41.300 --> 03:20:44.180]
Where we take triologically

[03:20:45.080 --> 03:20:48.520]
We've a flag in one hand with our hand in the sand

[03:20:48.520 --> 03:20:51.280]
And blindly follow the powers that be

[03:20:51.280 --> 03:20:53.680]
Habitat tick, ho, ho

[03:20:53.680 --> 03:20:55.480]
Up, washing stink from news

[03:20:55.480 --> 03:20:58.360]
On a 65 inch screen

[03:20:59.300 --> 03:21:00.620]
Scratch your balls and fire

[03:21:01.300 --> 03:21:02.600]
Everything's okay

[03:21:03.920 --> 03:21:06.640]
In the goddamn USA

[03:21:27.100 --> 03:21:30.780]
Go, let's marry

[03:21:36.640 --> 03:21:38.560]
Oh, oh, oh

[03:21:38.560 --> 03:21:43.120]
As Nancy K was leaving her ring

[03:21:43.120 --> 03:21:46.120]
She's lucked up from behind

[03:21:46.640 --> 03:21:51.400]
Bang, bang, ton, you're still the hammer came down

[03:21:51.400 --> 03:21:53.200]
Upon her knee

[03:21:54.180 --> 03:21:58.660]
Bang, bang, ton, you're still the hammer made sure

[03:21:58.660 --> 03:21:59.740]
On victory

[03:22:08.460 --> 03:22:12.820]
A limb-pick-madden round on you is an ugly ground

[03:22:12.820 --> 03:22:15.200]
Over every move

[03:22:16.640 --> 03:22:18.580]
She can't find the groove

[03:22:18.580 --> 03:22:19.780]
She's off balance

[03:22:19.780 --> 03:22:23.120]
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[03:22:23.120 --> 03:22:25.560]
She foregoes her plan

[03:22:25.560 --> 03:22:29.720]
Makes her way into the stand murder on her mind

[03:22:30.560 --> 03:22:34.320]
She has never minded a challenge

[03:22:34.320 --> 03:22:37.020]
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[03:22:38.320 --> 03:22:41.400]
The crowd they make a break for the door

[03:22:41.400 --> 03:22:45.220]
But it's too late to run

[03:22:45.220 --> 03:22:52.160]
Bang, bang, ton, you're still the hammer just smashing in their heads

[03:22:52.160 --> 03:22:58.580]
She would not leave little hammer till everyone was dead

[03:23:08.560 --> 03:23:11.040]
2048, Tom, you're at the perigate

[03:23:11.040 --> 03:23:13.360]
St. Pete checks his book

[03:23:14.440 --> 03:23:18.240]
He gives her a look and he tells her

[03:23:18.240 --> 03:23:20.800]
Now, out, out, out

[03:23:22.320 --> 03:23:23.600]
She claims she's innocent

[03:23:24.320 --> 03:23:27.860]
Laces up and throws a 50 ton of teeth on the line

[03:23:28.980 --> 03:23:33.500]
This guy's out of line and he's got to go

[03:23:33.500 --> 03:23:35.500]
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[03:23:36.400 --> 03:23:39.840]
As St. Pete was turning the page

[03:23:39.840 --> 03:23:43.500]
Tom, you're took perigate

[03:23:44.080 --> 03:23:47.940]
Bang, bang, ton, you're still the hammer rang saint
