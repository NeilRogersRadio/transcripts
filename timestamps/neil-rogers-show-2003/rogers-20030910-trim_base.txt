[00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:05.480]
The Jets are saying they got to play better defense against the Dolvin blizzard

[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.040]

One minute after that the elevator will rise to pages

[00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.540]
Three of your guys can pick up the bags and carry them out

[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.320]

[00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:34.140]
Okay, right am I right? Yes. Don't know much about crap don't know much about herpes I think I have herpes

[00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.100]
No, actually I do know quite a bit about it, but that's another story for another day

[00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.960]
I know a lot about the thick head herpes like calm down. Oh, okay

[00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.500]
That must have been why he was out yesterday hit like a chanker or something these stayed out for a whole day

[00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.700]
Well, it was God is right. He's such a pussy, you know

[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.680]
By the way speaking of Scott Scott junior in there may get paid does sometimes soon clearance was in her yesterday apologizing

[00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.240]
Yeah, you're full of crap clearance. You're we're on to you

[00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:02.280]
We're on to your baloney. Okay. He's stonewalling. He's just stalling installing and pushing it back and pushing it back

[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:07.400]
You know just try to like save a few bucks for a cheap ass outfit. Okay, let's get right to it

[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.280]
We don't have a lot of time today. We got a short show. We got just tons of crap

[00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.460]
Man, just tons and tons and tons of crap. Here's a little piece of advice for you by the way

[00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:18.960]
Everybody in the audience do not take Santa Cod unless you need it. You know what I'm saying? Wow

[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:25.680]
Well, you know my my words are healing up from that awful bacon experience that ate 75 pieces of bacon from how he was there

[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:31.400]
And I'm finally like it's almost gone, but I'm thinking well, you know you the stool softener is good

[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:37.520]
We can't talk about that. Can we stool softer? It's not lunch yet. Huh? No seriously, but it can't hurt

[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:43.120]
So for whatever reason I just took a Cennacott last night before I went to bed. That was a bad movement, man

[00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.440]
Wow this morning. I just woo

[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:51.920]
Heavy duty experience don't take Cennacott unless you really needed my should be taken Cennacott

[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:55.660]
Believe me. I'll keep you busy. My you'll be crapping your brains out all day long

[00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.500]
Anyway, the poor result from yesterday

[00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:59.360]
I don't know they just

[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:04.080]
The hundred and three votes. It's not too bad, but this was they're just not concerned, you know?

[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:09.020]
No, I'm not they're very very calm tomorrow. By the way, it's trests draft for his birthday on 9-11

[00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:12.100]
Happy birthday Troy. We're not playing the thing till tomorrow, right?

[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:16.080]
What's your take on this Thursday's two-year anniversary of 9-11? It's tomorrow

[00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:23.780]
It's tomorrow stay calm stay cool. We don't want to get anybody into a panic. Don't start losing your grip on reality

[00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:26.680]
George has suggested no

[00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:34.200]
Be afraid be very afraid nothing will happen 698 58% of this audience is fully confident that nothing is gonna happen tomorrow

[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:39.480]
Well, you know what you're all wrong because something's gonna happen. Yeah, so it'll come up right tomorrow

[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:41.860]
Maybe and maybe not

[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.620]
Maybe your son will come up tomorrow or go down

[00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:51.840]
Nothing will happen 698. What me worry 289? I'm buying duct tape and vis Queen

[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:56.540]
It was a late vision on their 92 say they're buying their duct tape and vis Queen

[00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:03.460]
Badchman will happen 54. I'm staying close to home all day 36 and I won't travel tomorrow 34 out of

[00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:08.180]
1203 votes on yesterday's pull we got two polls today. How do you like that two for the price of none?

[00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:11.320]
Here's the first one for this hour only

[00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:17.280]
We got a short show now. You know that's a crank call Scott. Don't you mind me beach? You know that line six is a crank mind me beach

[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:23.780]
That was great

[00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:29.660]
Edward Teller's dead is right 25 what a Nazi bastard he was

[00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:35.540]
I wonder if he was related to Nistva on guiding light top of our but at any rate

[00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:41.660]
Edward Teller's that you know you got the Tom Lerthing back though the Edward Teller song on there, right? We do you know

[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:48.080]
Yeah, we got the Tom Ler album back there. He's probably all of them. I don't know so never heard from Edward Teller the hell he didn't

[00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:51.180]
Or no, it was very fun brown well same difference. Doc

[00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:56.460]
Anyway, here's the first pull for today before we get to the heavy duty stuff all before we do it though

[00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:59.040]
This story about the lottery ticket this

[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:07.040]
In today's Harold and I just looked at this and I talked to myself. There's only one remedy for doing that

[00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:08.240]
Throwing your brains out

[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:14.820]
Who had the 50 million dollar ticket float as biggest lotto loser? It says when the clock tick passed 12 a.m

[00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:17.320]
Tuesday yesterday time ran out on somebody's dream

[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:26.860]
A 50 million dollar winning lottery ticket bought in North Bay village on March 12th expired the largest jackpot in Florida lottery history to go unclamed

[00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:34.680]
It was the 20th winning Florida ticket to be lost and more likely forgotten about the previous record was $60 million pot left behind in 1991

[00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:37.540]
I think I just feel the heavy pot

[00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:43.140]
Lottery winners have 180 days to claim their prizes the money now goes into the Florida education enhancement trust fund

[00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:46.100]
What does that mean that the kids go to school for like two days a year now

[00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:50.560]
Some of it will be reinvested in a new games for the lottery spokeswoman Sheila Griffin said

[00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:55.400]
Keep in mind the lottery is the biggest ripoff the biggest legalized ripoff in history mankind. Am I right?

[00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:56.160]
Absolutely

[00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:01.980]
One person is spying about the ticket Mohammed iZim Hosein owner of coal's food market in North Bay

[00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:06.580]
But let's still got his cut as the vendor who sold the winning numbers the lottery paid him 10 grand

[00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:11.380]
I gave some to a friend who works with me and sent some to my wife and bagel et al esh was on the only problem

[00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:15.460]
He might not be so happy if he checks with her and finds out she had a 50 minute ticket too late bitch

[00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:15.860]
I mean

[00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:18.920]
It says if the ticket holder finally shows up

[00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:25.520]
Then we'd have a five box of Kleenex party because he or she would be crying. Yeah Griffin said

[00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:27.660]
How do you like that?

[00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:31.460]
Who the hell is Griffin? Oh Sheila Griffin from the Florida lottery crying

[00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:37.280]
If you seriously stop and think about that you'll look in the drawer. Oh, look at that. There was my lottery ticket

[00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:37.500]
Oh

[00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:41.760]
There it is. I've been looking for that damn thing and of course you don't write down the numbers

[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:46.200]
You just and you look at it and there's like 22 23 35

[00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:50.280]
45 50 and 53 and then you reach in the other drawer

[00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:55.380]
A lot to be involved in really your freaking brains out you'd have to you just have to kill yourself wouldn't you?

[00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:59.440]
Absolutely rubber room at least now. What do you mean another winner sky?

[00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:03.480]
You see here we come in like Georgia becoming very cynical about our great-cowars. Here's Palm Beach. Hello

[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.400]
Get a lie buddy get a lie

[00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:13.660]
I win huh I win I picked it. What do you mean you win? He was good. I liked him. He was enjoyable

[00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:19.220]
Uh, he was almost he sounded a little like the dice man on a bad day with like a sore throat

[00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:23.440]
Here's the first poll for today which of these best describes why listen to the Nioh Roger show

[00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:28.200]
Which of these best describes why you listen to the Nioh Roger show for humor

[00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:34.860]
For liberal talking a few laughs. There's nothing else on I hate Neil, but I can't turn it off

[00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:36.680]
Neil is the radio god

[00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:43.360]
No, good. I'm a QAM listener or I love the crank callers which were two for two so much the first guy was good though

[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:48.480]
Yeah, that was the retire and that was the uh guy with the 85 horses. I'm starting to enjoy him actually

[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:51.580]
You know what when he's got something good like that? He was good today

[00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:54.800]
So it goes to show you if you just keep plugging away sooner lady might have something like mo

[00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:55.160]
You know

[00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:59.260]
Someday he might say something good on here. Absolutely. Haven't had nothing good so far

[00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:04.100]
It's only been like a year and a half. Can you say that? He's got such great hits in it in addition to way

[00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:07.460]
He does have a lot of hits mostly once you don't want like to think at her piece like that one

[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:11.800]
He was out sick with like a chirpy and like little extra crotch rot yesterday

[00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:14.080]
Come on mo booch up a little bit if you're gonna work on his station

[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:16.940]
You got to show up or be they like the rest of us by the way mad dogs off today

[00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:22.500]
You know i'm saying oh right because we work whenever we feel like it because we got a marlin game pregame at 12.35

[00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:27.300]
The red hot marlin's why believe are they 15 games over now scott 15 16

[00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:29.840]
16 81 65

[00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:31.800]
Oh my god

[00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:34.540]
They are sure they are assured of not having a losing season

[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:39.220]
I don't want to doubt your word, but I want to look in the paper here

[00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:40.660]
I'm not you know, I'm sure you're right

[00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:48.080]
But 16 games over would be astonishing and still nobody shows up when I have the home games because there's nobody there and nobody cares

[00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:52.840]
Anyway, they got the meds again this afternoon and we'll have that game for you like at 110 to start and game

[00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:55.680]
12.35 the pregame so we get out of here early to which we say

[00:10:55.680 --> 00:11:00.660]
Uh 80 and 65 it says here 80 and 65 my mistake

[00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:04.840]
But you are yeah, I gotta say one thing for scott here so consistent

[00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:09.040]
No, it would like to think with Mussolini and Romeo yesterday no matter what he says you know, it's wrong

[00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:12.580]
That's why I picked up the paper as soon as you said it because I already saw it

[00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:14.960]
They're 15 games over they have 17 games

[00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:16.980]
165 17 left

[00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:22.820]
So somebody who said earlier in the season marlins are gonna win 91 games and we all laugh and say what an idiot

[00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:27.460]
What I'm more on that person may have been right they may have been absolutely correct sir shocking

[00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:29.640]
So there you go. Let's uh

[00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:34.580]
Got the first pull up there. We got another pull in the 11 o'clock hour for the rest of the show and I got eight million

[00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:39.640]
The things here how we got to rush plus we got these tremendous calls like the one from Miami. Hello

[00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:40.700]
I'm listening

[00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:44.400]
So weak so weak

[00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:47.060]

Is spokesman for the Lawrence Livermore laboratory. He was 95. That's plenty old enough 95 Jesus

[00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:38.740]
Wouldn't all of us like to make it to 95. I'll take that

[00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:43.480]
You know the only people who aren't crazy about only making it to 95 it was her like 94 and a half

[00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:51.300]
Right, I suppose even my mom who's a little over 90 she'd like to make it to 95. She's still pretty strong mom

[00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:53.300]
I just don't I don't think it's in the cards

[00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:58.360]
Well, you know when you when you wind up being a bag lady at the age of 90

[00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:04.120]
You keep it that way. I don't think this is a big future. Yeah, well, you know that condo. She's got that I own

We got a lot of stuff again. We only got two and a half hours. We got the big Marlon Meds game any interest? No

[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:21.500]

Oh, there's the whining about the damn dolphin lost to a girl's team well

[00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:40.220]
Yeah, they got a shot

[00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:47.140]
Here's my any on six all calls are on six today, which is an omen. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. Is this a real call?

[00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:50.400]
This is a real call. I can't believe it

[00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:58.340]
And you know, we I tell you something the Q&A program is the Q&A programming department. I think it's gonna is upgraded at the town level

[00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:06.080]
Um, regarding sports radio programming Q&A but only technically when it comes to the play by play stuff. Yeah

[00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:11.980]
What is going on? I mean we've got the hurricanes and the dolphins are signature

[00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:16.480]
um sports on the station right and they have mohauer david

[00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:21.520]
Who is that one and embarrassment and all the how many times you're gonna tell us

[00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:26.300]
That every player is a former giant a former charger a former patriot don't care

[00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:31.200]
Yeah, well, well in most cases a former human being

[00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:38.740]
The gaki. I mean he crushed it. He crushed it. He crushed it. We every plane is a terrible sucks. Okay. Okay. Yeah

[00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:44.400]
I mean just I don't know what you're point that our play by play uh people are a little bit lacking now you've left out

[00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:50.760]
I noticed jugs McDonald from the panther game and a panther signed a old-liled old line big deal and you know the panther off the jone

[00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:55.820]
Like what is it? The panthers are off the map nobody cares about them. You can go to the park. You're absolutely right

[00:17:55.820 --> 00:18:00.040]
That's right. If nobody cares about the marlins you can imagine how many people really care about the panthers

[00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:02.700]
That's stretching it

[00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:04.700]
Have a great yes

[00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:07.760]
He crushed it he crushed it he crushed it

[00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:18.720]
But there's one thing he left out oh my oh my oh my oh my he left that out

[00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:22.060]
From the hyperventilating hysterical Joe Zagaki

[00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:27.220]
Bushlegan embarrassing good guy though, but really bush league in his performance and fits in perfectly with the um

[00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:29.440]
Just like a glove no wonder they want him to know other broadcast

[00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:34.320]
I mean why would they want to have like a bushly guy like Bill's inford doing you know guys like a real professional

[00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:40.640]
They don't want that they want the screaming amateur hour Joe Zagaki, but nevertheless. That's you and like I said it fits in perfect

[00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:45.160]
This story that I was about to do before we took that very important call

[00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:48.420]
Saudi police say Barbie dolls a threat to morality

[00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:55.960]
Okay, ready. I can see that Saudi Arabia's religious police have declared Barbie dolls a threat to morality

[00:18:55.960 --> 00:19:02.240]
Complaining that the revealing clothes of the Jewish toy. Which is what they call it already banned the kingdom our offensive to Islam

[00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:04.160]
Oh, yeah, didn't you know Barbie was Jewish

[00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:10.020]
You know everybody on the Jewish because if you get a kind doll he circumscuses back right then he's got that ring around his

[00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:11.020]
collar

[00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:15.160]
The committee for the propagation of virtue and prevention of vice. Oh, I like that

[00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:16.900]
What's that what's the acronym for that crap?

[00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:21.560]
The committee for the propagation of virtue and prevention of vice as the religious police are officially known

[00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:26.160]
lists the dolls on a section of its website devoted to items deemed offensive to the conservative

[00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:28.400]
Saudi interpretation of Islam

[00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:32.580]
Jewish Barbie dolls with a revealing clothes and shameful postures

[00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:40.020]
Accessories and tools. Oh, there's nothing worse than a shameful tool right our symbol of decadence to the perverted west

[00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:44.300]
Let us be aware of her dangers and be careful so to post her on the site Barbies a threat

[00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:51.980]
The poster plastered with pictures of Barbie in short dresses and tight pants all right with a few of her accessories reads a strange

[00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:57.060]
Request a little girl asks her mother mother. I want jeans the low-cut shirt and a swimsuit like Barbie

[00:19:57.540 --> 00:20:02.380]
Such posters are distributed to schools at hung in streets by the religious police or moot. What is it?

[00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:08.080]
Mutawa? Mutawa whatever the hell they okay goyem and dependent body affiliated with the office of the prime minister

[00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:10.600]
Vice police officials weren't available for comment

[00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:19.860]
Sheek Abdullah al-Merdas a preacher in a re-admask said the Mutawa take their anti-barbi campaign to the shops confiscating dolls from sellers and imposing a fine

[00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:27.040]
How do you like that? Oh, we're fine right although illegal barbies the creation of California based motel are found on the black market

[00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:31.600]
Where a contraband doll could cost a hundred reels which is 27 bucks US or more

[00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:34.680]
It's no problem that little girls play with dolls

[00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:40.040]
But these dolls are not of the developed body of a woman and where we're feeding clothes al-Merdas said these revealing clothes will be

[00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:44.900]
Imprited in their minds and they'll refuse to wear the clothing we're used to as Muslims the sheikh said as in shakia booty

[00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:51.100]
Isn't that incredible? We're not talking about people in the stone age are we? No, oh thank goodness for that

[00:20:53.020 --> 00:21:00.080]
So Jewish Barbie doll oh brother. Yeah, these Shmata heads man just enough to make you want to puke your guts up

[00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:02.580]
We're gonna we got a couple of calls in them

Which sounds good for every day then it oh yeah, can you imagine don't tease because all the other fakers on this station

[00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:17.820]
They get by with two hours three hours and we got a four-hour thing we got to do for this kind of money

[00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:23.060]

Okay, you better hop on it because 11 o'clock this is gonna disappear 89 votes

[00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:34.500]
Neil is the radio god 26 for humor 16

Rate something to change monthly 5.19 APR

[00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:14.580]
I'm a local

[00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:16.560]
This is my city

[00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:18.040]
The radio's on yours

[00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:20.560]
Q-A-M

[00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:23.040]
F*** yourself

[00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:28.700]
Will I hate what to do with on Q-A-M?

[00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:31.140]
Put that bag in back on again

[00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:34.800]
I want what they had before these are my kind of guys

[00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:38.780]
When the hell they do it anyway

[00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:41.660]
If the man we sounded died was really gay

[00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:43.380]
I want more at Christmas

[00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:45.260]
Because the voices feel high

[00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:49.000]
When I listen to the sports

[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.660]
A manly voice won't get my attention

[00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:54.380]
I will really get me sent to the shorts

[00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:57.040]
A squeaky high voice will give me an erection

[00:24:57.040 --> 00:25:00.160]
I'll hate what to do with on Q-A-M

[00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:02.640]
Put that bag in back on again

[00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:06.080]
I'm going to miss here at straight men when voices this high

[00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:10.480]
Now I'll have to get deeper in that closet again

[00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:13.280]
So I can impress all the macho friends

[00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:16.560]
The check out Chris Moore at night to help the fans inside

[00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:23.040]
Yeah, there ain't nothing like having macho sports guys as voices has some fractions

[00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:24.700]
They were 12 years old

[00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:26.560]
Yeah, I can't neglect that

[00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:30.120]
Yes, stand up real close to the radio and press the sound

[00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:32.200]
Get their voices out of there

[00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:34.900]
Really makes my balls take over here

[00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:36.760]
And that crow man

[00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:39.520]
Well, he's smarter than my infrared brother

[00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:39.880]
Yep

[00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:43.360]
1032 and 560 WQM

[00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:45.060]
We sure aren't getting much uh

[00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:46.020]
Uh, uh, uh, slap over

[00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:48.240]
You know what I'm talking about? In other words, when we came to Q-A-M

[00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:50.200]
Five and a half years ago, almost six now I guess

[00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:53.360]
Uh, it's like we brought our own audience

[00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:54.460]
Right? You know what I'm talking about?

[00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:55.440]
I don't

[00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:57.960]
140 votes on here and uh, I'm a Q-A-M list

[00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:00.100]
There's only three in other words, when they vote for it,

[00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:03.300]
That means they listen to the station and the fact that they listen to Q-A-M

[00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:05.200]
And we're on here is why they're listening to this show

[00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:07.620]
Well, I need to good, I mean, what is that?

[00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:10.000]
2.1%? That's pretty lame

[00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:13.320]
56 people say they're listening mainly for liberal talking a few laughs

[00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:16.800]
Neil is the radio god 41, of course that's the operative answer

[00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:21.360]
For humor 28, there's nothing else on five, that's a good point

[00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:23.360]
I hate Neil but I can't turn it off for

[00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:27.300]
I'm a Q-A-M list, there are only three and I love the crank colors only three out of the first 140 votes

[00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:30.620]
Big facts just in here

[00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:35.340]
What does that say? Oh no, who is that? I can't even pronounce the name Larry Hovis

[00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:36.700]
Okay

[00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:39.360]
Is that a, do you know who that is? Sergeant Carter?

[00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:41.380]
But is that his name? Larry Hovis

[00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:42.600]
Yeah, Larry Hovis, that sounds right

[00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:47.540]
Actor and comedian best known for his role as Sergeant Carter on the long-running TV show Hogan's Heroes

[00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:49.460]
He was also regular on Gomer Pyle

[00:26:50.740 --> 00:26:51.540]
Uh, USMC

[00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:53.640]
Well, guess what? He died

[00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:59.780]
And also Ronan Martin's laughin who guessed that on numerous games shows during the 70s including match game and the Liars Club

[00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:04.020]
died September 9th yesterday of cancer in San Marcos, Texas at age 67

[00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:04.620]
Did you die?

[00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:07.640]
Larry Hovis, I have no idea who that is

[00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:10.280]
I didn't watch Hogan's Heroes

[00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:10.580]
Oh, it was great

[00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:12.660]
No, it was not great

[00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:14.680]
You thought you never watched it?

[00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:16.600]
Well, maybe that's why I don't know it was great

[00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:17.300]
It was funny

[00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:21.640]
Didn't watch Gomer Pyle USMC, didn't watch that, that was just silly

[00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:24.600]
I did watch Ronan Martin's laugh and I don't remember no Larry Hovis though

[00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:28.480]
I watched match game, religiously, I love match game, it's still on the Gendro channel all the time

[00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:30.300]
Never seen Larry Hovis, this kind of a liar

[00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:36.580]
The Liars Club, who was on the Liars Club was that Mike Stokey who was also on Panamide Quiz?

[00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:39.300]
I don't know, I don't know

[00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:40.360]
Somebody will let us know

[00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:42.200]
So Parker Bryan or one of those old guys will let us know

[00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:43.860]
Anyway, Larry Hovis, who?

[00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:45.720]
I could say but then I'd be lying

[00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:49.700]
Stars from Hogan's Heroes, it says in its facts, they're dropping like flies

[00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:52.780]
Well, goddamn man, he's just a hell of a lot of that death going on, you know what?

[00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:56.240]
What are all these calls on here? I got just too much stuff

[00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:58.660]
We only got till 1230 and then you know me

[00:27:59.280 --> 00:27:59.600]
1230

[00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:02.240]
I'd like to get a few of these idiots on, here's Poppano, hello

[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:03.760]
Hi, Dale

[00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:05.680]
Yes sir, how are you sir?

[00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:06.780]
I'm doing great

[00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:11.420]
Good, the first time I've ever called, I usually don't have time to call you, I work for a living

[00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:11.960]
Right

[00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:15.680]
And one thing you really are, you're a very funny guy in fact

[00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:21.440]
I'm a too bright, I don't even understand how you can attract an audience with you both you and Georgia, extremely intelligent, bright

[00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:23.300]
Yeah, I don't know how you get an audience down here

[00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:27.640]
I wanted to discuss a little bit about this religious fanaticism and how the interest is to the world

[00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:28.680]
Take all the time you like

[00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:32.920]
Yeah, I don't know if you're a fan of Bill Mars

[00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:36.920]
No, I think Bill Mars is an asshole but anyway

[00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:41.740]
But basically he said that the religious fanaticism is dangerous

[00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:47.620]
So the Islamic fanaticism is very dangerous because we feel like they can just blow themselves up and take everyone else with them

[00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:52.620]
The Christian fundamentalists are at least amusing, at least they're not there

[00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:56.920]
They're amusing? Well ask the abortion doctors who got shot and killed while they're amusing or not

[00:28:57.140 --> 00:28:59.060]
Take everyone with them

[00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:00.980]
Yeah, I'm not a sh**

[00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:07.360]
Ask all the people who died in the crusades and in the Spanish Inquisition if it was amusing, have a nice day sir, don't call me again

[00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:10.580]
What is this guy? Do I need to Bill Mars fan?

[00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:12.380]
Bill Mars is such an asshole

[00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:16.820]
No, I don't want this guy to take it personally because he likes us but his call is horrible

[00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:20.700]
So keep listening, we hope you'll listen but your call was protested and unacceptable

[00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:25.660]
And it's just unconscionable that you would say Shazkrab about the fundamentalist Christians are amusing

[00:29:25.660 --> 00:29:30.480]
Not only are they not amusing, they're annoying, they're obnoxious, they're dangerous, they're crazy people

[00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:33.700]
And this is what the problem is is that America takes it all too lightly

[00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:40.140]
We're talking about religious extremists, see this is the reason that the mainstream media because they're so afraid to lose sponsors and offend anybody

[00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:47.680]
That's why this whole thing with 9-11, there's very little discussion about religious extremism except the course with Muslim extremists

[00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:48.960]
Yeah, they're the only bad ones

[00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:53.980]
Right, they're the only bad ones and you recall that people like Billy Graham, Sun, Franklin Graham and all these others in the beginning

[00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:56.560]
We're making these grotesque as usual comments about Islam

[00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:59.620]
And oh well that's really a violent religion and all that stuff, you know

[00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:01.540]
As opposed to Christianity and the other ones

[00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:08.680]
And Judaism which the Jewish God was telling them to like smite all of their enemies, make sure they don't miss any, you know

[00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:12.300]
Religion is sick, it's not a debatable point

[00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:19.800]
I mean, you people that are brainwashed and can't mentally emancipate your brains from all the religious indoctrination and bull crap

[00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:22.300]
Hey, I understand, it's not easy

[00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:29.220]
From the moment that you're old enough to understand even before you really comprehend they start hockin and bangin' it in there and bangin' it in there

[00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:31.520]
That's what the altar bar said, they keep bangin' it in there

[00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:32.380]
Correct them, that's right

[00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:35.380]
Don't get soar about it

[00:30:36.780 --> 00:30:39.500]
But it's just, oh Christian, now what is this?

[00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:45.720]
This is a vision of the cap of what is Bob Eisenberg, this guy is on top of stuff, man since we got him that new piece from Czech Alphairi

[00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:48.020]
You almost think he has some clue what he's doing

[00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:50.060]
Hey, by the way Bob, you're an asshole too

[00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:55.620]
Remember those days? Sure, down on the second floor of Bob Eisenberg running around telling people I was an F&A school

[00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:57.240]
He got his record, he got to know you though

[00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:59.720]
Yeah, he got to know me, he got to know me as a real asshole

[00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:02.380]
I'm an asshole Bob and I'm proud of it, how do you like that? Then Bob and me

[00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:05.780]
Doesn't bother me, I'm an asshole with a big fat paycheck twice a month

[00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:09.460]
Including today, Clarence I hope, it better be there, it better be showing up sweetheart

[00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:14.900]
Clarence, who's a real big all of a sudden trying to hold people's money back like poor Scott Jr. there

[00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:18.160]
Yeah, the audience has heard this, they know the game, what is this pop it'll be to allegedly

[00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:19.820]
See, this time, you didn't put it on there

[00:31:19.820 --> 00:31:27.020]
See Scott, don't pay attention what George tells it because George is a bad, a bad, a bad, a bad, a bad, a bad, a bad, a bad, a bad, a bad, a bad, a bad person who gets too emotional

[00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:30.640]
He starts writing down a bunch of numbers, he gets all wild, you know

[00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:34.840]
He just got to calm down, he's got a few more doggy downers before the show would be good

[00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:39.240]
But when you put on there like question mark and the ass sure stuff like that and then you keep putting it on

[00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:40.440]
Are you notice how those people disappear?

[00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:41.920]
Yes

[00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:43.380]
You want to know why they disappear?

[00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:45.360]
Tell me, because I hang up on them

[00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:46.340]
I thought so

[00:31:46.340 --> 00:31:46.980]
I see

[00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:48.980]
Here's Pomfano Beach allegedly, hello

[00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:50.020]
Hey Neil, how you doing?

[00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:51.280]
Pretty good, is this a real call?

[00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:52.180]
It's a real call

[00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:52.920]
I see

[00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:53.760]
Yes

[00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:58.000]
Well, I wanted to make a comment about GW first and say that

[00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:58.480]
Yes

[00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:00.700]
I was pretty upset when the whole election thing went down

[00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:03.620]
Can barely hear this call for some strange reasons Scott, yes go ahead

[00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:08.220]
Anyways, I was upset about the election but I had no idea what we were in store for

[00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:11.660]
And just really pisses me off when I think about all that

[00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:16.760]
But as far as your poll today goes, I have a suggestion for you

[00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:17.320]
Okay

[00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:22.100]
And why don't you add poll building shows to the reason why people like to listen?

[00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:24.160]
The reason why people listen?

[00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:24.660]
Yeah

[00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:27.980]
Because they like to poll building shows

[00:32:27.980 --> 00:32:33.080]
Well, I think the choice could be I like Neil's poll like Hank says

[00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:33.960]
There you go

[00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:35.900]
I think it's become a central part of the show

[00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:36.660]
It has

[00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:39.140]
Give a chance for us to say whether we like it or not

[00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:39.800]

[00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:48.980]
It wasn't a good call on line 9 Scott, you keep hanging up on those people on line 9

[00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:49.920]
I like Neil's poll

[00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:50.160]
Yeah

[00:32:50.820 --> 00:32:51.180]

[00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:10.220]
Okay, now what's the I'm the puppet master beta so what are we putting on here now?

[00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:13.140]
I like Neil's poll

[00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:18.220]
That's cute, you know, that's good, but if he goes LL or he can spell the however

[00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:21.020]
I'm okay if people are too stupid to understand it then we can't be bothered

[00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:21.800]
That was a good call

[00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:24.080]
I suggest you answer that was a good guy see

[00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:27.720]
I'm like the guy before him that would mend well that you know

[00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:31.880]
Evidently thinks he's intelligent, but he's telling me to Christian it a fundamentalist Christianity now

[00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:37.700]
Maybe I didn't let him finish do you think so no he was no he was serious. Yeah, I waited a second to see if like he was going to there was some

[00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:40.680]
Some gag or some pun or something

[00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:46.920]
So sarcastic don't want to want me to believe that crap about fundamentalist Christians are humorous. They're not humorous

[00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:51.760]
They're pathetic. They're dangerous. They're crazy people who's responsible for this war right now

[00:33:54.060 --> 00:33:56.260]
Are you not can W again? Yes good

I

Why is there a new price?

[00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:09.780]
46 thank you Mr President for those low gas prices. I can't get that punk out of my mind I call that day you know about the glorious

[00:37:09.780 --> 00:37:13.480]
Free freeing of the Iraqi people and the lowering of the gas prices at

[00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:15.820]
What asshole man what a bush liquor

[00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:23.640]
Suicide bomber kills three people in Iraq as the carnage goes on other American soldier died this morning trying to get the little more information about that

[00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:31.400]
But it's just becoming so routine like murders in Miami that they don't even report much on it anymore you know what I'm saying that's old unless you catch the

[00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:38.400]
Bourbon there real quick you don't even know another US soldier dead but this is a separate story a suicide bomber exploded in SUV

[00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:44.420]
Outside the US intelligence headquarters killing three other Iraqis and wounding dozens including four Americans a Kurdish security

[00:37:44.420 --> 00:37:51.320]
Officials said today the US military and Baghdad had said six Americans were wounded later said four intelligence officers were hurt along with the

[00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:58.340]
Kurdish Peshmerga guard at the building you know those Peshmerga's who the Kurdish the Kurdish official who spoke on condition you know

[00:37:58.340 --> 00:38:02.320]
I was taking yesterday again. I could go off on a long rant. We don't have time today

[00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:11.400]
But how is it possible that the public is so God them stupid like the thing with a Taliban all of those years went on nobody

[00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:18.040]
gave a flying thing about the Taliban about the women with the burkas about they couldn't listen to the music how repressive they were and about the

[00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:24.200]
Spartan existence that these people were forced to live on nobody cared until after 9-11

[00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:29.440]
Then all of a sudden we started seeing eight billions to every day there were like a whole other whole bunch of stories

[00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:36.420]
About the Taliban and the repression that the foisted on the poor Afghan people did how many people in America really

[00:38:36.420 --> 00:38:41.600]
Give a flying crap about Afghanistan don't tell me about 30 or we wouldn't like five right hey even the Afghan

[00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:47.160]
Hounds didn't care about it the brownie hounds didn't care about God in Afghanistan it couldn't fight it on a map with both hands

[00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:53.080]
Nope and then all of a sudden here comes the America I'm going to tell you right now the American media are the enablers

[00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:57.840]
There were the ones who enabled Kenny star and all the right-wing Republicans do all that penis gate with Bill Clinton

[00:38:57.840 --> 00:39:04.720]
There were the ones who made the whole big son of dance and made it possible for us to get as far as all that impeachment crap and waste millions of dollars of your tax money

[00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:12.260]
And are the same ones who are letting this asshole off the hook who just raised another three million bucks down here in Florida over the last couple days

[00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:18.820]
Just great shame on you as Michael Moore would say but in this case I'm talking about the freaking American media

[00:39:18.820 --> 00:39:23.180]
It's a pretty sad commentary when it takes Tammy Fade into the truth

[00:39:23.180 --> 00:39:25.640]
The media is sick and they've got badly

[00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:27.900]
Amiga sick and we need help badly that's the problem

[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:38.860]
Anyway the answer all Islam organization with suspected ties to al-Qaeda was formerly based near some place that I can't pronounce about 30 miles east of Urbila near the Iranian border

[00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:44.900]
Answer headquarters was bombed by US jets during the war surviving members of the group were thought to have fled to Iran

[00:39:44.900 --> 00:39:48.940]
They're now believed to have returned to Iraq which is now becoming a hotbed of terrorist activity

[00:39:48.940 --> 00:39:53.440]
Which it wasn't before we started the Iraq attack the operation Iraqi freedom right?

[00:39:54.320 --> 00:40:02.620]
How do you like them apples huh? I'm saying that again don't let me say that anymore don't say I'll hit you know my I get a we all do that we get on for some of the right sticks in your mind if san

[00:40:02.620 --> 00:40:05.680]
It don't let me do that no more okay

[00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:12.600]
Because some things I mean after well gets to be irritating even though it might be true like I think I have herpes like most in at this morning

[00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:20.560]
I think I have herpes cut it out mo that would be irritating that would be I think I have herpes especially herpes on a scalp under his I think he just I think he had a scalp glued on too tight

[00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:31.060]
That's why he was out yesterday so he's got herpes under his earpea to peel it off how is that pull coming this is our first pull we got the important one this is just you know just for clarification

[00:40:31.060 --> 00:40:37.640]
I think it's kind of interesting don't you once in a while no you know you don't like this pull of course I like this pull well no one you get me crap

[00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:43.080]
Now you sound like Scott there is you trained him bad you trained him so badly hey Scott paying no attention to George

[00:40:43.740 --> 00:40:47.320]
Venerable was paying attention to George look what happened to him so he wasn't

[00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:59.140]
226 votes so far which of these best describes why you listen to me or I just show for liberal talking a few laughs 84 I think I think that covers it right sure

[00:40:59.780 --> 00:41:16.380]
the other four god 65 for a humor 48 there's nothing else on 10 for people who don't like Dr. Laura and Russian all the other crap that's on when we're on but that's a good excuse that's why I put it there I love the crank callers 9 I'm a QM list of 6 pretty weak

[00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:25.520]
Duff and clearance pretty weak you should be bringing us more to the table than that if we had all right we were on like a talk station I'm not talking sports talk

[00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:34.880]
We are like I would be used to be when it was great for about five minutes if we wanted that then we'd be siphoning a tremendous number of listeners from the other shows on a station

[00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:41.380]
And we could get instead like a 10 or 11 share and then we could get 30 men right but we're stuck with whatever we got I hate

[00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:58.080]
Neil but I can't turn it off for and I like Neil's pole which Eric being very cute spelled P O L E crossed the output P O L cute Eric he's getting almost too good you know it's scary he's great he the Eric is great so we take it see this goes to show you as long as you're still breathing it's never too late to be rehabilitated absolutely

[00:41:58.080 --> 00:42:08.740]
No, not you Moe you're there's no hope for you it's too late Carol King wrote that song it's too late now number the name of the song it's too late yeah it wasn't any of the song you know like

[00:42:08.740 --> 00:42:17.100]
Carol King she couldn't sing right of a paper sack what did she write she wrote some good songs though Carol King like a hundred did she well about there she wrote a lot of music

[00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:24.640]
Carol King she couldn't sing for a Schmidt can't like Bob Dylan Bob Dylan wrote great music though and couldn't sing at all we not a note just a no in and whiny

[00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:32.700]
FCC says Howard Stern's Ranchie Radio Show is a news program like that nice going how he

[00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:41.780]
When you think about news shows what comes to mind it says there's meetings on CNN's a website there's meet the press and face the nation of course if you do a good job on meet the press

[00:42:41.780 --> 00:42:46.980]
Oh yeah rule the world that was another memorable call like that asshole

[00:42:48.340 --> 00:42:54.620]
Oh, you know something this this you just facts me that was that oh this is gotta be on a pool

[00:42:55.080 --> 00:43:00.580]
Oh, we'll have to leave this up there till like 11 30 or something do you want to know why I know why

[00:43:00.580 --> 00:43:09.580]
Hi, this is sunny Fox I listen to your Rogers could I can hear the word asshole right because I like to hear the word asshole that Eric I hate to force you to pull one more on here it's my bad

[00:43:10.220 --> 00:43:15.340]
Because here's the facts from Ralphie uses I listen to your show because I like to hear the word asshole so that's that's the other choice

[00:43:15.340 --> 00:43:22.040]
Center because I like to hear the word asshole speaking of which I saw guy wearing a t-shirt that said my mother told me I could be anything I wanted to be I decided to be an

[00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:26.960]
asshole to which we say oh yeah what's wrong with that what's wrong with being an asshole

[00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:33.980]
Huh anyway getting back to this story about Howard sperm the federal communications commission ruled yesterday that Howard's

[00:43:33.980 --> 00:43:39.980]
Ronshey radio program is a bona fide news interview program the decision was in response to request made by the New

[00:43:39.980 --> 00:43:44.180]
York based infinity broadcasting ink which wanted a ruling that it's widely syndicated

[00:43:44.180 --> 00:43:49.740]
Stern show as a news program an example of equal time requirements for political candidates the decision will allow

[00:43:49.740 --> 00:43:55.520]
Stern to put actor Arnold Schwarzenegger on the air without having to offer equal time to the scores of other candidates running for government

[00:43:56.740 --> 00:44:03.040]
California citing an 84 decision that qualified the Donahue talk show for news exemption and of course don't you always think generally a

[00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:05.460]
Fill Donahue and Howard Stern like in the same vein oh

[00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:10.520]
Difference being that Howard is still on the year the FCC said there should be room for less conventional

[00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:16.280]
Interview formats to increase coverage of the political process since the Donahue decision other news interview programs

[00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:21.320]
Or segments there are with unique and innovative format elements such as the Sally Jesse Raphael showed Jerry Springer

[00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:26.400]
And politically incorrect with the anxious idiotic Bill Mar have qualified for the news interview you know Bill Mar is just a

[00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:32.640]
Puts you know I wouldn't even say he's an asshole he's a Puts he's just very he's ineffectual he's like a poor man's dick

[00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:40.320]
Cavitt right I can't stand it he's just a wimpy little nerdy guy and the bitch stupid that stupid book about if you ride

[00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:48.520]
A loan you're riding with Osama I mean what a stupid bunch of crap you know and then Ariana Huffington who lately has been writing some good stuff but you know

[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:55.500]
What what what what what was the one that she wrote her and she said the same thing something like that right some of you drive it

[00:44:55.500 --> 00:45:00.600]
As you be you're a terrorist something like that some similar kind of crack can't stand Bill Mar

[00:45:01.340 --> 00:45:08.320]
See pull it then hold politically incorrect thing to people well, you know he's he's anti-established man big deal who cares so

[00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:12.780]
So for often the so's Ralph Nader what what he do for us look what he helped us get look what he

[00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:21.560]
Look all you people have voted for Nader in 2000 shame on you man shame on you including Michael Moore as much as I love Michael Moore he voted for Nader

[00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:27.400]
And speaking of Donahue he not only voted for Nader he was banging the drums he was the cheerleader

[00:45:27.860 --> 00:45:34.300]
It is pom-poms out remember that I do I mean you know I'm not saying a Ralph Nader doesn't have some very good points

[00:45:34.300 --> 00:45:41.660]
But the point is that what's the sense of throwing your vote away so and it isn't that what I was screaming back then I was screaming look what we got now

[00:45:41.660 --> 00:45:47.440]
You want to look what we got you warned everybody I warned you vote for Nader and throw your vote away

[00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:52.440]
It'll be close enough they can like weasel this thing in there and they weasel their way and man there's nothing worse than a God damn weasel

[00:45:52.440 --> 00:46:00.360]
That's what they did sneak this bunch of goi men here again the Bush your masters see this is supposed to be a democracy

[00:46:01.380 --> 00:46:07.620]
Not a goddamn monarchy and between the Kennedys and the Rockefellers and the Bushes you see what it's all about

[00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:16.740]
Handful of very very dubious suspicious wealthy families who acquired their wealth most of them through a by hook and mostly by crook

[00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:19.340]
Just like Joe Kennedy with his goddamn bootleg

[00:46:19.340 --> 00:46:27.080]
By the way how's Brian greasy's toe doing every time I hear that I think I said Brian greasy I don't know why I don't know

[00:46:27.080 --> 00:46:32.700]

[00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:43.620]
Did you know that no I do know well now you know that

[00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:51.340]

Hurricanes though because applies a limited and of course how it's also got a great selection certified pre on cars trucks SUVs you know what I'm going to say next because we always tell you because a lot of people are nervous about shopping for a car because they have the marginal credit or maybe their income is kind of limited like George

[00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:27.440]
but if you have credit problems it's not a problem at how it because the whole idea that being in business is they want to sell you a vehicle if the 2003 blowout sale going on right now at Halibut AX EMC with 134 1 South Dixie highway if you haven't been here I have no idea why because they've been there forever on US 1 right across from the falls open area

jet fuel formula and box top robbery along with fractured furi tales narrated by miss Edward Everton and Mr. Peabody it's a brilliant hilarious show way ahead of its time and you are absolutely correct

[00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:44.100]
the facts who's on the sale listen your show for humor and read the website for news so-called liberal conservative talk is contrived and boring and then here comes the good part and again it's not a knock on the goddess but he's he's right

[00:52:44.580 --> 00:53:02.460]
someone like Randy has her heart in the right place but she's just spinning her wheels especially in this town she had organized buses yesterday to take protest just the only thing you'll be in this we're saying was Randy the bus doesn't have air conditioning he's going to give herself a coronary embolism for nothing sir you again you are absolutely correct

[00:53:02.460 --> 00:53:10.180]

[00:57:12.820 --> 00:57:17.260]
job and then of course he says well I've got devious plans for that for that the

[00:57:17.260 --> 00:57:23.760]
constitutional at the school size amendment that'll then the public passes it and he

[00:57:23.760 --> 00:57:28.580]
starts unleashing his devious plans and tries to like twerk the world of the public like you guys didn't really

[00:57:28.580 --> 00:57:33.560]
mean this did you I mean he comes right out he gets caught on tape saying a screwed a public

[00:57:33.560 --> 00:57:38.440]
okay I've got some devious plans for that and the public says hey we like that let's put you back in the

[00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:42.420]
way again I'm starting to wonder if maybe Janet might have done a little bit better

[00:57:42.420 --> 00:57:50.340]
than bills bills make bride you think no how is that possible how can the electorate in Florida be so

[00:57:50.340 --> 00:57:56.540]
guided and stupid are they a bunch of mug ones I forgot man that's that's astonishing to me it's amazing

[00:57:58.440 --> 00:58:02.220]
here's the good news though right on the heels of that about him raising the three million box he

[00:58:02.220 --> 00:58:05.480]
hasn't got a child in chance if you like somewhere tomorrow against any Democrat I'm

[00:58:05.480 --> 00:58:09.200]
going to who that was they could bring back George McGovern again they could dust off water Mondale

[00:58:09.200 --> 00:58:15.220]
who lost him in a soda even and he still would be bush with a sweeping six to one vote

[00:58:15.220 --> 00:58:19.360]
the Santa Cruz California City Council became the first local government in the

[00:58:19.360 --> 00:58:24.920]
country yesterday to ask Congress to look into a peaching president bush yeah it's

[00:58:24.920 --> 00:58:30.740]
time for us to open up this can of worms of councilman Tim Fitz Morris no relation to

[00:58:30.740 --> 00:58:37.200]
Morris Gibb late in grade was butchered in a month sion i city leaders say bush violated

[00:58:37.200 --> 00:58:40.460]
international treaties by going to war in a rack and that the president manipulated public

[00:58:40.460 --> 00:58:45.660]
fierce to justify the war and undercut constitutional rights and he is the resolution

[00:58:45.660 --> 00:58:50.400]
authorizes Santa Cruz Mayor Emily Riley dissent letter to the House Judiciary Committee chairman James

[00:58:50.400 --> 00:58:54.720]
Sensenbrenner asking if Bush is committed any impeachable offenses that could lead to his ouster

[00:58:54.720 --> 00:58:59.160]
or let's only hope the council vote came in pack chambers where supporters of the

[00:58:59.160 --> 00:59:03.920]
resolution lined the walls some carried signs that read honor the constitution impeachment now

[00:59:04.560 --> 00:59:06.780]
and god bless and keep bush out of power

[00:59:07.460 --> 00:59:09.720]
what do you like that i like it a lot

[00:59:09.720 --> 00:59:13.560]
and the settlement of those signs was echoed by members of the council the vote again was six to one

[00:59:14.280 --> 00:59:17.220]
i happen to think what's going on is a high crime in mr. Meanor but let's

[00:59:17.220 --> 00:59:22.040]
leave that to the u.s congress to decide said councilman in u.s. and u.c. Santa Cruz professor Mike Rocken

[00:59:22.540 --> 00:59:25.900]
Tom Mullin a retired dentist was one of three people at the meeting who spoke out against the

[00:59:25.900 --> 00:59:29.040]
resolution it's not an issue that the city council should be involved in this just

[00:59:29.040 --> 00:59:33.500]
serves to divide the community he be saying such divisive political stands aren't

[00:59:33.500 --> 00:59:37.040]
unusual in the coastal town a year ago Santa Cruz became the first of what was

[00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:41.900]
well to 165 city councils to oppose the war against Iraq Santa Cruz was also one of

[00:59:41.900 --> 00:59:44.840]
more than a hundred cities declaring its opposition to the patriarch so did

[00:59:44.840 --> 00:59:47.300]

Neil's pool only one I thought that guy had a good suggestion but nobody else did

[01:04:33.740 --> 01:04:38.540]
apparently what I'm saying he's right the pool is an important part of the show but that's not

[01:04:38.540 --> 01:04:42.960]
why they listen and anyway here's the second pool since it is such an important part of the show

[01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:48.000]
wackos in the world absolutely correct the the news story is from Alabama yeah it talks about how

[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:55.940]
the governor's request for a tax increase was rejected despite the fact that he told the voters

[01:06:55.940 --> 01:07:05.280]
of Alabama that it was their Christian duty to help the poor by shifting the burden of paying taxes

[01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:13.380]
more to the people who could afford paying taxes and the comment in the paper was from a political

[01:07:13.380 --> 01:07:22.660]
expert in Alabama that Christians do believe but they also vote their pocketbooks so what does

[01:07:22.660 --> 01:07:31.720]
that tell you about who their god really is and once again Alabama leading the nation in

[01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:38.820]

Are you sure?

[01:14:51.800 --> 01:14:55.440]
74 votes are our second poll. This is the main poll of the day. This is the main event.

[01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:00.080]
74 votes on here already. Other than George W. Bush, who's the most dangerous man in the world today.

[01:15:00.080 --> 01:15:05.780]
Dick Cheney 17, don't see too much of Dick. Donald Rumsfeld, the 14th yesterday.

[01:15:05.900 --> 01:15:10.240]
Mo Howard David and the Pope are in a flat footed time. How do you like that? Ever see the two of them together? No.

[01:15:11.560 --> 01:15:17.760]
Mo Howard David had probably because the thread he might spread the Z's. I think I have herpes. Yeah. That makes them dangerous.

[01:15:17.760 --> 01:15:22.500]
Right there. Forget about that terrible show. No bad ratings. Mo Howard David and the Pope 9 of peace.

[01:15:22.500 --> 01:15:30.320]
Oh, some of it. Same here. Here. Here. Here do. Well, some have been lawden eight. Kim Jong Il eight. Nobody knows who that is.

[01:15:30.740 --> 01:15:35.820]
On Neil Roger six in Russia. And well for somebody says, put Pat Robertson and Jerry Fala on her. Right away. Thank you, Ben and mine.

[01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:43.520]
How you been? That's a good suggestions right there. Pat Robertson and Jerry Fala speaking of dangerous fundamentalist Christian lunatics.

[01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:52.500]
Readness down the erode the hell in a hand basket for fun and profit. By the way, I guess Pat Robertson was really all better to shave about poor Chuck Taylor there in Liberia.

[01:15:52.920 --> 01:16:06.980]
Who? All those diamond deals he had going ill. Pat Robertson, all of his quick friends over there in Africa. I just mentioned that in passing also five six seven oh five 60 pound five 60 on a AT&T and Verizon line. Here's for Lauderdale. Hello. Hello.

[01:16:06.980 --> 01:16:14.180]
Yes, sir. First two things. I have. I have somebody I want to pull your poll. All right. Reno.

[01:16:15.680 --> 01:16:26.320]
Janet Reno is the most dangerous man in the world. Okay. Next second thing. The second thing that color that called it about Arnold Swollon Packer. I don't think he's been 400 pounds in 10 years.

[01:16:27.620 --> 01:16:41.180]
Okay, well, that's a hell of a call man. I told you. Wow. By the way, Eric, don't put Janet Reno on there. It's just a little funny. You guys try a little a little lane humor five six seven oh five 60.

[01:16:41.580 --> 01:16:48.840]
The reason I mentioned is because anything you could mention it because Eric is being so efficient. You've seen it happen. It just all the sudden pops right up there on a pool.

[01:16:49.840 --> 01:17:01.100]
He's going to be picked up or jam. Although she is certainly a lot more much than the pope. Where we going? Cool Gables. Hello. Good morning, Neil. How are you? Yes, sir. Good morning to you. I've got one for your poll. Okay. Richard Pearl.

[01:17:02.120 --> 01:17:15.320]
Not choice. Dr. Death. When I see that fundamentalist, I get I have to go under the bed. He's scary. Oh, he sure is. And if we put him on there, we probably should put Paul Wolfowitz. Well, yeah, they're the they're connected at the hip.

[01:17:15.320 --> 01:17:27.280]
Right over the calls by Ted Kennedy. The other day was great. It was beautiful to see that wasn't it? Yes, it was. And you know, I was I have another point, but I was distracted by that 400 pound Arnold call. Oh, you're beautiful.

[01:17:27.620 --> 01:17:43.700]
You know, the who the governor of the state is really isn't overall that important to the rest of us in the country except for one thing. Just like in Florida, the governor gets to pick the secretary of state who then picks the secretary of elections like Catherine Harris, those types of characters.

[01:17:43.700 --> 01:17:57.700]
And that is the importance of the governor. It isn't just that, but the fact is that it is again, it's attempt by the right wing lunatics. But these people are wanted to subvert the will of the public and overturn a legal election, which is unusual in this country to have legal legitimate elections anymore.

[01:17:58.100 --> 01:18:13.260]
And then that's what it's all about. It has nothing to do with the great Davis. And so they prop up this, you know, somebody was tremendous popularity because they know that all the pop stars, anybody who's a pop icon in this country for whatever reason is almost unbeatable. And that is Arnold, you know, I'm more on.

[01:18:13.260 --> 01:18:24.400]
Well, the purpose of it is to get a hold of the electoral college votes of California, which is has a great impact on that. I think I'm going to have well, we'll see because you know, listen, I'll bet George and Scott's life on a right now.

[01:18:24.500 --> 01:18:34.480]
And next year's election, George W's got as much chance of winning a California is you got to finding 50 million cash in your backyard in that lottery ticket. I agree with you, but it is part of their ongoing campaign that you were.

[01:18:35.140 --> 01:18:45.480]
And but something that I did see this morning that was very disturbing that further confirms what you've been saying in my mind about the press being fully beholden to this president of their campaign.

[01:18:46.180 --> 01:18:58.120]
As I was watching or listening to in the background that American morning show on CNN that has Darren Kagan there. And she cuts who Walter Rogers, their correspondent in Baghdad. I'm sure you've seen him.

[01:18:58.120 --> 01:19:09.840]
Yes, I mean, he gave the report on that poor soldier that was killed trying to disarm a one of those improvised bombs. And he reported that in the last 24 hours, six of our troops have been killed.

[01:19:10.700 --> 01:19:20.060]
And I've been scouring everywhere all over the internet. Where the hell is that still? Yes, yes. I can't even find a story on the internet about the one soldier that admitted got killed.

[01:19:20.700 --> 01:19:30.560]
I'm just stunned by this at a time when the president is receiving a lot of criticism for this 87 billion dollars on top of the hundred seven billion dollars in tax cut.

[01:19:30.760 --> 01:19:31.840]
Why I don't hear too many people.

[01:19:31.900 --> 01:19:38.920]
Okay, well, I just check. I'm just checking right now. I'll read it to you. They're finally admitting now to after days without an American fatality.

[01:19:39.540 --> 01:19:44.720]
Two US soldiers were killed in separate incidents over the last 24 hours. US central command says.

[01:19:44.720 --> 01:19:54.060]
Well, Walter Rogers just confirmed that he had spoken with them at sent comm and six soldiers according to his report this morning that six soldiers have died in the last 24 hours.

[01:19:54.100 --> 01:20:02.620]
And for what? And for now, that's the question we got. American kids dying over there every single day. They've been lied to. Now they're saying we have no idea how long you're going to have to be there.

[01:20:03.060 --> 01:20:12.120]
We have no idea when there's no end in sight that the war is really still going on as well. Wolfowitz said. And this, you know, the public has been lied to and everybody watching. Whoopi Goldberg.

[01:20:12.120 --> 01:20:22.760]
Well, I have one question to ask you and everyone else out there. If our troops want to come home and their tours of duty have been extended longer than the contract that they have signed.

[01:20:23.500 --> 01:20:27.000]
Aren't they now technically conscripts?

[01:20:27.280 --> 01:20:32.980]
You're asking me. Well, I'm just I'm just throwing that out at this sort of like a point of order. Maybe for a consideration.

[01:20:33.220 --> 01:20:37.100]
Point of order. Point of order folks. Point of order. I don't know. Somebody maybe knows the answer. I don't know.

[01:20:37.100 --> 01:20:46.240]
You know, aren't they technically conscripts and that they're there beyond their. I think under the pay for you to act in under the mandate of Donald Hermann Gehring-Rumsfeld.

[01:20:46.240 --> 01:20:50.300]
They're going to be there as long as we want them to be there regardless. That's true. Good luck to us all, Neil. Thank you.

[01:20:50.340 --> 01:20:55.480]
I think I think it's the Scott Jr. philosophy. We just decided they're going to be there without pay. Have a great day, sir.

[01:20:55.640 --> 01:20:58.100]
Be good. Yeah, we're really taking good care of veterans. Aren't we?

[01:20:58.100 --> 01:21:06.560]
The administration. So scandal. The people in Santa Cruz are right, man. They got it right on the money in peach today.

[01:21:07.620 --> 01:21:14.380]
Before this insanity just gets to well already is totally out of control. 87 billion. Yeah.

[01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:21.640]
It's worth it. And it has nothing to do with the war on terror as he keeps saying nothing to do with it. Zero. Zipity do da.

[01:21:21.640 --> 01:21:27.020]
The the P-neck people decided this holy racketack years ago we put even a stolen 2000 election.

[01:21:29.360 --> 01:21:33.880]
But don't and of course you won't find that in the mainstream media. You won't find nothing about that.

[01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:39.760]
I'll say it again without the media. They are complicit. They're a part of this. Audio media assholes out there.

[01:21:39.760 --> 01:21:43.200]
And I know you listen to people of the CNN bureau or Miami. You all listen to this show.

[01:21:43.960 --> 01:21:50.640]
Your bunch of lunatics. Your bunch of grave robbers shame on you. Just like in Vietnam it only went after the public.

[01:21:51.300 --> 01:21:57.380]
Went nuts mostly on college campuses first and then finally when the public began realize how many thousands of kids were coming home in body bags.

[01:21:57.740 --> 01:22:03.760]
And they really totally turned against the war only then did the media finally decided like start telling us the truth.

[01:22:05.120 --> 01:22:09.900]
Because if you wait here truth from the US government. I'm not just talking about Bush. I'm talking about anybody in the US government.

[01:22:09.900 --> 01:22:14.020]
You wait here the truth you're going to wait a long time till hell freezes over heavy duty for a hockey game.

[01:22:15.380 --> 01:22:23.200]

He was trying to suggest a name it then he wasn't no he didn't get the name

[01:27:10.640 --> 01:27:15.360]
Oh, you didn't well, that's why I asked him about all and first of all he was like screaming and mum

[01:27:36.720 --> 01:27:39.760]
Hey first of all nail. Yeah, I was watching Paul both of what's up

[01:27:39.760 --> 01:27:42.980]
Yeah, I couldn't believe there's no hold yet

[01:27:43.460 --> 01:27:48.800]
Secondly, did you see the Democratic candidate to pay last night? No, he did not somebody called about it

[01:27:48.800 --> 01:27:54.180]
Well, I think sparks actually had a agenda. I think the reason that the sparks news wanted sparks or hit me

[01:27:54.180 --> 01:27:54.760]
I want to put the

[01:27:55.800 --> 01:28:02.420]
Absolutely unwatchable space rescue up there. I was actually watching it a bit. It was it was comedic

[01:28:03.180 --> 01:28:05.740]
It was what comedic comedic comedic

[01:28:06.480 --> 01:28:09.120]
Okay, mostly grown and Al Sharpton were just

[01:28:10.100 --> 01:28:16.260]
They were comics released for the rest of them, but the answers they were given and the fact that they won't touch themselves or

[01:28:16.860 --> 01:28:21.180]
Anybody else or hardly got to go George Bush at all. They weren't touching each other

[01:28:21.180 --> 01:28:24.760]
No, they were touching each other. I'll be damned. That would have been a lot more exciting

[01:28:24.760 --> 01:28:25.220]
I guess

[01:28:26.640 --> 01:28:31.840]
I'm sorry and missed it and the way the way it's not I'm glad I missed it. I think I did the right thing

[01:28:31.840 --> 01:28:35.300]
Well, pretty human's not another pretty thing to look at it was very difficult to walk away

[01:28:35.300 --> 01:28:39.100]
I mean probably probably a choice if I would have just stayed at home either whoopee or that so

[01:28:41.900 --> 01:28:48.820]
Have a great day. Thanks for making your call. Oh, I almost forgot about this. There a girl 12 years old settles piracy suit for two grand

[01:28:49.980 --> 01:28:56.320]
This is so embarrassing man. I mean what when is the public kind of like start being alarmed by the kind of crap that's going on, you know?

[01:28:57.560 --> 01:28:59.860]
George Orwell is spinning in his grave a

[01:28:59.860 --> 01:29:06.000]
12-year-old girl in New York was among the first to be sued by the record industry for sharing music over the internet is off the hook

[01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:13.800]
After her mother agreed yesterday to pay to grand the settle the lawsuit apologizing admitting that her daughter's actions violated US copyright laws

[01:29:13.800 --> 01:29:20.940]
The hurried settlement involving Brianna LaHara an honors student was the first announced one day after the recording industry

[01:29:20.940 --> 01:29:25.520]
Associates of America file 261 such lawsuits across the country

[01:29:25.520 --> 01:29:31.400]
Lawyers for the RIAA said Brianna's mother Sylvia Torres contacted them early yesterday to negotiate

[01:29:32.320 --> 01:29:34.980]
We understand now that file sharing the music was illegal

[01:29:34.980 --> 01:29:41.600]
Tore said in the statement distributed by the recording industry you can be sure Brianna would be doing that no mo no mo

[01:29:42.740 --> 01:29:49.800]
As a matter of fact she was playing that on the phone. She stole that from us, too. Yeah, she said Brianna won't be doing that

[01:29:49.800 --> 01:29:50.240]
No

[01:29:53.240 --> 01:29:57.160]
Brianna added I'm sorry for what I've done. I love music. Don't want to hurt the artists. I love

[01:29:58.700 --> 01:29:59.980]
Case against Brianna

[01:30:02.040 --> 01:30:07.960]
Was a potential minefield for the music industry from a public relations standpoint the family lives in a city housing project in the York

[01:30:07.960 --> 01:30:12.660]
Upper West Side and they said they mistakenly believed that we're in Tadalodon, low music over the internet because they had paid

[01:30:13.480 --> 01:30:19.300]
2999 for software that gives them access to online file sharing services. How do you like that making it even more embarrassing?

[01:30:20.520 --> 01:30:24.220]
Even in the hours before you believe them. No, but it sounds good

[01:30:24.220 --> 01:30:29.020]
Even in the hours before the settlement was announced Brianna was emerging as an example of what critics said was overzealous

[01:30:29.020 --> 01:30:33.940]
Enforcement by the powerful music industry the top lawyer for Verizon Communications Inc.

[01:30:34.120 --> 01:30:39.200]
Charge jury yesterday during a Senate hearing that music lawyers had resorted to a campaign against 12-year-old girls

[01:30:39.200 --> 01:30:43.180]
Rather than try to help consumers turn to legal sources for songs online

[01:30:44.180 --> 01:30:48.560]
Verizon's internet subsidiary is engaged in a protracted legal fight against the RIAA

[01:30:48.560 --> 01:30:54.480]
Over copyrights of penis and Verizon customers Senator Dick Durbin, Devacred of Illinois also alluded to Brianna's case

[01:30:55.340 --> 01:31:02.320]
Are you headed to junior high school surround up the usual suspects Durbin asked RIAA president Carrie Sherman during a Senate judiciary hearing?

[01:31:03.020 --> 01:31:12.980]
Durbin said he appreciated the piracy threat of the recording industry, but added I think you have a tough public relations campaign to go after the offenders without appearing heavy-handed in the process

[01:31:13.560 --> 01:31:17.080]
Sherman responded that most people don't shoplift because they fear they'll be arrested

[01:31:17.780 --> 01:31:22.420]
We're trying to let people know they make it caught therefore they should not engage in this behavior Sherman said

[01:31:22.420 --> 01:31:27.580]
Yes, there are going to be some kids caught in this, but you'd be surprised at how many adults are engaged in this activity

[01:31:28.280 --> 01:31:34.580]
And other they got the public really scared crap in their pants nobody's gonna be sharing files downloading no more now

[01:31:35.400 --> 01:31:37.800]

Hi, sir

[01:36:23.540 --> 01:36:24.260]
Mr. Mouse

[01:36:24.980 --> 01:36:28.160]
What the hell are you doing to me?

[01:36:28.700 --> 01:36:31.680]
What do you mean sir? Why am I reading in the paper?

[01:36:31.680 --> 01:36:36.680]
You're going to put a Disney theme park in Brooklyn. Well, sir. We're just scouting locations

[01:36:36.680 --> 01:36:40.600]
Jesus I'm scouting CEOs you are killing me

[01:36:40.600 --> 01:36:43.680]
But sir look what we've done with New York City Times Square

[01:36:44.800 --> 01:36:45.360]
Raymond

[01:36:49.360 --> 01:36:50.960]
Car on the vacuum cleaner

[01:36:50.960 --> 01:36:53.580]
Remus get that blue bird out of here

[01:36:55.140 --> 01:36:59.720]
Eisner but sir look what we don't admit down man had 40 second street is incredible

[01:36:59.720 --> 01:37:04.420]
I don't want publicly. I support it that but you took all the point away. You're telling me

[01:37:04.420 --> 01:37:09.580]
I'm going through gabbles gone like pets. We're just scouting areas calm down

[01:37:09.580 --> 01:37:15.340]
Listen to me but much don't tell me to calm down. We got lucky with lead low and stitch 128 million dollars

[01:37:15.340 --> 01:37:20.060]
Now you're trying to ruin the whole network. We're kind of programming. Are you running?

[01:37:21.480 --> 01:37:22.860]
Hang on a minute

[01:37:23.500 --> 01:37:23.560]
You

[01:37:24.540 --> 01:37:25.180]
Remus

[01:37:25.180 --> 01:37:29.140]
Yes, I blew my crap all over your shoulder

[01:37:29.920 --> 01:37:32.280]
When you're so up for heaven's sake

[01:37:33.180 --> 01:37:35.500]
And cut off the module cleaner

[01:37:35.500 --> 01:37:42.940]
Good god sir the network is fine. Why couldn't you come up with American Idol? Good god

[01:37:42.940 --> 01:37:47.000]
You're still running James Bob movie. There's 60 years old

[01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:52.560]
Why don't you just put steamboat willing on and be done with it? Please don't make a couple of damn dollars

[01:37:53.200 --> 01:38:00.140]
Well the movie division's fine you mentioned we owe in stitch and now we have the new emnight shumma on movie coming out later this summer

[01:38:00.660 --> 01:38:07.280]
Signs what the hell does that mean stop sign yield sign you got to start swinging some of these titles pass me

[01:38:10.840 --> 01:38:11.320]
Remus

[01:38:15.260 --> 01:38:17.220]
I know you can't hear me

[01:38:22.860 --> 01:38:24.960]
You're not here Remus and take that

[01:38:24.960 --> 01:38:28.780]
All right, my sir

[01:38:28.780 --> 01:38:33.260]
Yeah, sir, I'd be very careful the next time I started my car. Why were you?

[01:38:33.640 --> 01:38:36.660]
What do you mean sir? I'm not done with you what bad done?

[01:38:37.180 --> 01:38:39.120]
I put hand a storm in your job

[01:38:39.940 --> 01:38:41.660]
You're terrible. I'm sorry

[01:38:41.660 --> 01:38:46.040]
Baby, I put Remus in there. I don't like to be president of Disney Remus

[01:38:46.040 --> 01:38:46.660]
Oh

[01:38:46.660 --> 01:38:51.000]
My what a wonderful day. Get out of here. You're nothing

[01:38:51.540 --> 01:38:57.740]
level four five sixty double the QA and we got 224 votes other than GW's the most dangerous man in the world today

[01:38:57.740 --> 01:39:02.840]
Dick Cheney time with Don Rumsfeld 43 piece or some of your mama 34 the Pope 21

[01:39:02.840 --> 01:39:07.600]
King junk yield 20 John Ascroft is steadily climbing up toward the top 18

[01:39:07.600 --> 01:39:12.340]
Mo Howard David is on Ascroft's back 17 the O'Rodgers 13, Marceline Ball 11

[01:39:12.980 --> 01:39:18.680]
Jerry Falwell one Pad Robertson one Richard Pearl one and Paul Wolf of which one that's because most people have no idea who they are

[01:39:18.680 --> 01:39:19.600]
Which is very unfortunate

[01:39:20.200 --> 01:39:26.380]
news corporation chairman Rupert Murdoch we know who he is a real asshole the brains behind the anxious ultra right wing

[01:39:26.380 --> 01:39:27.440]
Fox Network

[01:39:28.420 --> 01:39:37.660]
Rupert Murdoch said there's a 6040 chance that president GW Bush will veto a bill that blocks the federal rule allowing TV networks such as Murdoch's Fox to buy more local stations

[01:39:38.980 --> 01:39:43.800]
As once again the Bush family continues to frame the world of the public they have the biggest plans

[01:39:44.380 --> 01:39:47.740]
Bush will veto the bill if he has enough supported Congress to sustain the move

[01:39:47.740 --> 01:39:51.840]
Murdoch said yes they are marks of a Morgan Stanley median communications conference in Boston

[01:39:51.840 --> 01:39:56.740]
The FCC passed the new medium ownership rules in June as we all know to our dismay

[01:39:57.680 --> 01:40:02.340]
If there is any chance at all of the presidential being a vetoing upheld by the center of the Congress

[01:40:02.340 --> 01:40:07.460]
I think you'll find that Bush will veto it and the new rules put up by the FCC will stand Murdoch said

[01:40:07.660 --> 01:40:09.260]
I give that a 60 to 40 chance

[01:40:10.240 --> 01:40:19.700]
The Senate appropriations committee last week approved a bill that would block the rule interest groups including the national rifle association and consumers union have argued that it would reduce programming diversity

[01:40:19.700 --> 01:40:27.240]
Networks including Viacom Inc. CBS GE's NBC and Fox say consolidation will help them compete with cable and satellite TV

[01:40:27.240 --> 01:40:28.000]
right

[01:40:28.820 --> 01:40:34.860]
The new station ownership rule would allow networks to buy local stations reaching as much as 45% of us viewers up from the previous

[01:40:34.860 --> 01:40:39.800]
Limit of 35% we feel the campus completely outdated should be their Murdoch center response to a question

[01:40:40.460 --> 01:40:47.140]
He said foxes increased news and news services on its stations by 50% in the past two years more than locally owned stations have done

[01:40:47.140 --> 01:40:51.380]
He also said the cost of sports programs for cable and satellite TV distributors will come down

[01:40:51.380 --> 01:40:54.060]
right fair and unbalanced man

[01:40:55.120 --> 01:40:58.660]
There you go just it just continues. There's no end to it no way to incite

[01:40:58.660 --> 01:41:01.480]
Whatever the public wants Bush will give me the opposite

[01:41:01.480 --> 01:41:05.820]
But you know something it's going to pass overwhelming me in the Senate and as a result he'll never be able to

[01:41:06.300 --> 01:41:08.920]
Deliver him but never be able to have his veto upheld. Oh

[01:41:09.500 --> 01:41:10.180]
What a shame

[01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:17.680]
5 6 7 over oh 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T and Verizon line a lot of pressure to there were these two and a half hours shows

[01:41:17.680 --> 01:41:18.980]
You know, but I could get used to it

[01:41:19.920 --> 01:41:22.100]
I'm thinking three hours max, you know

[01:41:22.780 --> 01:41:25.580]
Who's starting like October 1 three hours max same pay

[01:41:26.160 --> 01:41:29.800]
Everybody on a station three hours sick from all like about maybe three minutes. Absolutely

[01:41:31.100 --> 01:41:32.360]
Here's for a lot of Dale. Hello

[01:41:33.620 --> 01:41:38.580]
Pretty good. Good. I'm gonna jump around a little bit first the guy will call a few calls back

[01:41:38.580 --> 01:41:44.540]
Wanted to give you a name, but you couldn't understand him. You said aerial sure on oh and well get him on there right away

[01:41:45.160 --> 01:41:51.880]
And wasn't my pick my pick is runny. I think runny is a scary son of a no, but aerial sure on belongs on there absolutely correct

[01:41:51.880 --> 01:41:53.800]
Okay, I also watch oh

[01:41:53.800 --> 01:41:56.940]
I also watch some of the

[01:41:57.580 --> 01:42:00.680]
The debate in front of the black caucus last men as well black caucus

[01:42:02.140 --> 01:42:06.760]
And some of the things that I did here in the media part of what you didn't say do caucus did you

[01:42:07.720 --> 01:42:14.760]
Call out to go ahead and caucus. Okay, okay, some of the things that I heard were and just you were speaking of earlier also

[01:42:15.160 --> 01:42:16.760]
one of the questions was asked to

[01:42:17.340 --> 01:42:19.880]
The carry does he think that president

[01:42:20.560 --> 01:42:21.240]
Bumble's quad

[01:42:21.780 --> 01:42:26.560]
Purposefully to Steve the public and he's dance. He did a great gene killing impersonation

[01:42:26.560 --> 01:42:30.180]
Then the person went to Bob Graham and F. Tim and his answer was yes

[01:42:30.180 --> 01:42:33.480]
You know beautiful. It was straightforward. It was perfect

[01:42:33.480 --> 01:42:37.840]
Yeah, their Graham is really sensational, which is probably why I haven't got a chance. I know it's Gary

[01:42:38.320 --> 01:42:42.880]
He's such a up front person. He's like right. What we I was on the intelligent committee

[01:42:42.880 --> 01:42:47.460]
We knew and he should have known that there was no imminent threat that he had that

[01:42:47.460 --> 01:42:53.380]
But I'm afraid had nothing to do with anything. I've been doing nine and eleven and yes

[01:42:53.380 --> 01:42:54.840]
He purposely deceived the public

[01:42:55.380 --> 01:42:59.820]
And I was waiting for a follow-up question. Do you think that's an impeachable offense? But no one ever asked it

[01:42:59.820 --> 01:43:00.100]
Mm-hmm

[01:43:01.600 --> 01:43:03.960]
Here right away as a wafer, you know in the beginning

[01:43:03.960 --> 01:43:08.560]
He supported he voted for it and then they turns around now while he didn't have an exit plan yadda

[01:43:09.080 --> 01:43:13.740]
He's he's a wafer. How are deemed to me as the only one that's really a butch stuff and it's right from the beginning

[01:43:13.740 --> 01:43:16.420]
Oh, yeah, I'm part of that part of something else. They had asked that

[01:43:18.180 --> 01:43:20.480]
No more foot Lieberman if

[01:43:21.260 --> 01:43:21.740]
Oh

[01:43:21.740 --> 01:43:25.400]
If we should cow-towel to

[01:43:26.140 --> 01:43:32.240]
To Israel and of course he was with him and hawing about it and ask how routine how are teams like no

[01:43:32.240 --> 01:43:36.300]
You can't be partisan on both on either side either you're gonna be you know

[01:43:36.300 --> 01:43:39.800]
You're gonna be a somebody who's gonna bring peace or you're gonna kiss somebody's ass

[01:44:12.960 --> 01:44:18.440]
According to the email that we received as tech support they did give out the information they were bound

[01:44:18.440 --> 01:44:23.740]
They said to give out the information, but they were trying to get around that by letting people know that look

Speaking of that here's hi Alia. Hello. A Neil. Yes, sir. How you doing great. I know if you got a chance to

[01:51:41.520 --> 01:51:44.080]
And or if you saw the article but last week

[01:51:44.080 --> 01:51:49.300]
um in the Mami Harold they had like a really small article and towards the end of the article

[01:51:49.840 --> 01:51:52.980]
They asked Laura Bush what she thought about what was happening

[01:51:53.500 --> 01:51:59.620]
Uh with the soldiers that were coming back in you know bodyguides. Yes, and she answered that she didn't want to

[01:52:00.380 --> 01:52:03.820]
Uh in a beautiful mind she didn't want to worry about what was happening

[01:52:04.700 --> 01:52:09.900]
Instead of being sympathetic to the families of all the soldiers that have died. Yeah, she was like

[01:52:09.900 --> 01:52:15.520]
I don't want to worry about it. I'm thinking oblivious. Yeah. Yeah. In other words if he just blocks it out of her mind and pretends it doesn't happen

[01:52:15.520 --> 01:52:22.140]
Then she wouldn't have to feel so guilty and so bad the same way that she's blocked out of mind that her daughters like to drink a lot and party and booze but

[01:52:22.760 --> 01:52:29.420]
Right. All right. Thank you very much. Thank you for pointing that out. Okay. As if we don't know what a bunch of degenerates the Bush family already are

[01:52:30.300 --> 01:52:33.900]
Nice divorce there Neil. I'm sorry. And I semester with a Silverado SNL

[01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:38.720]
But the public doesn't care. They just don't care like I said

[01:52:38.720 --> 01:52:45.220]
Cheb Bush gets caught with his guy. They impance down with his mouth wide open making stupid idiotic comments on tape and a public says

[01:52:45.220 --> 01:52:48.520]
Hey, well, how soon can we put it back in here again? We like this a crook

[01:52:49.100 --> 01:52:50.460]
We like this freaking liar

[01:52:51.780 --> 01:52:56.640]
So why should we get upset about you know, we just we just live our little pathetic meaningless lives and do the best we can

[01:52:56.640 --> 01:53:01.600]
That's all your life means as much as as it means to you and that great philosophy sure

[01:53:01.980 --> 01:53:07.500]
That's right if it means a lot to you then it's important, you know if it'll mean nothing and uh oh I like this

[01:53:08.240 --> 01:53:12.800]
Law let students forego senior year. I wanted to mention this yesterday. I think I didn't mention you but touch

[01:53:12.800 --> 01:53:14.200]
Don't it. I touched it briefly

[01:53:14.740 --> 01:53:17.780]
Of all the ways attempted to free up space and florida crowded classrooms

[01:53:17.780 --> 01:53:22.440]
This one could be a dream come true for high schoolers in a hurry a diploma without a senior year

[01:53:22.440 --> 01:53:24.660]
Which I think most of you are aware of if you paint any attention

[01:53:25.360 --> 01:53:28.740]
Supporters of a law granting high school diploma in just three years that will help curb

[01:53:28.740 --> 01:53:34.560]
Crouting and florida schools critics virul to private early graduates of extra-curricular activities and senior year milestones

[01:53:35.860 --> 01:53:42.740]
The state's top education officials already warning that the new law essentially enabling students to forego their senior year is not for everyone

[01:53:42.740 --> 01:53:47.700]
It shouldn't be abused. It was meant for a small group of band of students who were not only mature enough

[01:53:47.700 --> 01:53:54.460]
But smart enough to graduate education commissioner Jim Horan said it's not an attempt under classized pressure to do away with the 12th grade

[01:53:54.460 --> 01:53:55.940]
Right, of course not

[01:53:56.680 --> 01:53:58.620]
It's not part of those devious plans you think

[01:53:59.540 --> 01:54:04.080]
The fast track graduation laws among several measures passed this spring in a wake of the voter approved

[01:54:04.080 --> 01:54:07.820]
Amendment requiring the state to take immediate actions to reducing class sizes

[01:54:08.420 --> 01:54:13.840]
The amendment sets caps for every grade including no more than 25 students per high school by class by 2010

[01:54:14.760 --> 01:54:15.720]
Under the option

[01:54:15.720 --> 01:54:21.740]
Students can graduate with six fewer credits as long as they double up on English classes to learn four credits and study a four

[01:54:21.740 --> 01:54:27.900]
Language for two years see there allowed to skip several elective credits including physical education art and life management courses

[01:54:27.900 --> 01:54:31.340]
Yaudi-yaudi-yaudi-na partridge and it just you know it's more the same crap

[01:54:31.340 --> 01:54:36.780]
Can complain about the education in florida because generally speaking they're ain't none. Did I say florida in America?

[01:54:37.800 --> 01:54:38.640]
For a cent

[01:54:39.400 --> 01:54:43.440]
87 billion dollars and that's only the tip of the iceberg now they're saying the critics and the

[01:54:43.440 --> 01:54:46.600]
Mac really so that's that's only the lowball figure

[01:54:47.680 --> 01:54:50.840]
Because Georgie always did like the highball himself every now and

[01:54:50.840 --> 01:54:55.020]
But he liked the eight ball before he found Jesus and weighs a little behind the eight ball now

[01:54:55.480 --> 01:54:58.700]
With that Humpty Dumpty problem that he can't put the pieces back together again

[01:54:59.700 --> 01:55:05.040]
87 million to try to extricate ourselves from this mess all based on attack a lies

[01:55:07.040 --> 01:55:08.720]
But nevertheless the public says

[01:55:08.720 --> 01:55:14.420]
Hey, what times the party start when do we get to vote for Arnold and what times the movie Goldberg show back?

[01:55:14.420 --> 01:55:18.140]
We like to lie and how about the what's that treasure island show? What is it called?

[01:55:19.780 --> 01:55:25.560]
Oh, I shall temptation island temptation. I don't watch any of those shows. I do like the previews though

[01:55:25.560 --> 01:55:28.120]
Well, there's some interesting people on the previews

[01:55:28.120 --> 01:55:33.500]
They're depending on the lineup they get that temptation island. I still say the best of those shows was the um

[01:55:33.500 --> 01:55:40.420]
Am I hot are you hot? Are you hot? Is it hot? Is it boiling? Is it rated like word or it's spurt that damn Lorenzo ruined it for everybody

[01:55:40.820 --> 01:55:41.200]
I

[01:55:42.500 --> 01:55:46.940]
Don't know why you got such a bone up your ass about Lorenzo Lamas. Uh, because he sucks

[01:55:48.020 --> 01:55:50.580]
Well, that makes him even more desirable to some

[01:55:53.100 --> 01:55:56.920]
Rumsfeld 50 let's take a peek at this 58 for uh, Rummy right now

[01:55:56.920 --> 01:55:58.720]
He is dangerous now because he's losing it

[01:55:58.720 --> 01:56:03.220]
He's absolutely losing it and the troops when he was over there on the last weekend said hey don't come talk to us

[01:56:03.220 --> 01:56:05.600]
We don't we want to go home. We don't want to have nothing to do with you

[01:56:17.060 --> 01:56:20.800]
I was somebody a documentaries on on the Nazis and on the Nuremberg trials

[01:56:21.540 --> 01:56:24.360]
I'm thinking Nuremberg would be a great place for a Rumsfeld and

[01:56:25.120 --> 01:56:31.300]
Wolfowitz and Richard Purl and they still have that courthouse don't they all of these guys and dick chaining the translators

[01:57:03.060 --> 01:57:05.480]

[01:57:06.180 --> 01:57:10.540]
It's kosher pet Robertson one and Richard Purl one out of two hundred ninety seven votes so far

[01:57:11.640 --> 01:57:13.820]
Here's a call from four lottery. Oh, hello

[01:57:13.820 --> 01:57:15.760]
Anya how are you pretty good sir?

[01:57:16.200 --> 01:57:21.460]
Excellent um what just two points first of all I was it was pretty amusing and I know it's just talked to

[01:57:21.460 --> 01:57:26.180]
Twisted sense of humor that I have but uh, I was I put on the news yesterday and

[01:57:26.180 --> 01:57:30.680]
To see you know a group of women in front of the hotel that

[01:57:31.760 --> 01:57:35.720]
Here's that right all holding a fine thing that they love the bush

[01:57:37.240 --> 01:57:38.500]
I'm about true

[01:57:38.500 --> 01:57:43.360]
Kind of was that we know there. I bet you Janet might have been one of them. I didn't see her

[01:57:43.360 --> 01:57:50.900]
I bet you somebody had a good friend of yours like yellow put this on. What about Donna Shalela? You think she might have been there?

[01:57:51.320 --> 01:57:53.820]
I think she wanted to be there. Mm-hmm. Yeah

[01:57:54.340 --> 01:58:00.400]
The second thing is um you were talking about how popular uh the ratings on what these show were

[01:58:01.360 --> 01:58:05.720]
And honestly I think it's because this is actually the first show that has

[01:58:05.720 --> 01:58:11.080]
Cruision humor on it you know humor that you know it of course from someone

[01:58:11.080 --> 01:58:15.820]
Originally for someone who is from Iraq or from Iran or someone from that region

[01:58:15.820 --> 01:58:20.680]
So I think that my prediction is in the future you're gonna see a lot of shows

[01:58:20.680 --> 01:58:24.000]
Copping that chemistry. There's gonna be a lot more show

[01:58:24.520 --> 01:58:29.740]
Now hard to talk about really genius gonna have it is show it finally that magic flying carpet is gonna come in handy

[01:58:29.740 --> 01:58:30.340]
Exactly

[01:58:32.220 --> 01:58:37.140]
Thanks, Rodiel. Thank you pal. I have a great day good calls today by the way George for uh, you know all your skeptics out there

[01:58:37.140 --> 01:58:40.260]
Yeah, we started out we had one or two and even you know

[01:58:40.260 --> 01:58:44.540]
We should have known the first guy even though it's one of our chronic regulars who did the uh

[01:58:44.540 --> 01:58:46.640]
Edward Teller that he was great. He was great

[01:58:46.640 --> 01:58:51.400]
Which goes to show that even when you're dealing with some dickhead like that once in a great while he come up with something good

[01:58:51.400 --> 01:58:54.240]
Brad that was way back at uh hours ago hundred hours ago
