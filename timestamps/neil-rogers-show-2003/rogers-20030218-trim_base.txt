[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:44.180]
But during national brother to eat national brother to eat

[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.080]
It's American as apple pie, but during

[00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.320]
national brother to eat

[00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.620]
National brother to eat

[00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:18.080]
New Yorkers love the Puerto Ricans cause it's very chic

[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:25.460]
Step up and shake the hand of someone you can't stand you can tolerate him if you try

[00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:29.540]

[00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:00.160]
Oh

[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:05.920]
I don't agree for that kind of the some of the facts yesterday about thank goodness

[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.640]
We don't give the time on a show 903 at 560 WQA. I was just I don't know

[00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.160]
Now he made me conscious about it. Don't you feel a little self conscious? No, I

[00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:17.220]
Don't I mean

[00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:23.800]
So anyway, the support yesterday we got a pretty good response on that the only problem being that George is pissed off and fired up about the result

[00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:29.640]
Yeah, well the most bizarre movie you've ever seen pulp fiction went by a landslide

[00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.920]
But we'll get to that in a second South Korea before you get into a big panic today

[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.960]
I know everybody's on edge of course for the purple alert and

[00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.200]
South Korea it was a nutcase a nut job of

[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.120]
Man, purple mental illness all those people had died on the subway and that fire

[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.120]
He walked under with a milk carton full of flammable crap and live it on fire

[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.880]
But anyway, it was not a terrorist act so calm down, please

[00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.420]
Also the thing in Chicago a lot of a crap going on you know what yeah

[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.280]
Chicago Club was told a close second floor currently where Chicago official but but

[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:11.140]
The owner says is it turned disputes the charge day a second floor facility was supposed to be closed according to the city but

[00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.740]
The owner's attorney says an agreement reached in October between the club called E2 in the city

[00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:19.800]
Allow it to operate as long as the lounge on the north side of the building rain closed

[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.440]
So there's a big conch terms about that is they're trying to you know find the skate code and

[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.660]
Who's responsible for these why do they keep calling it a stampede? Isn't that kind of an unusual?

[00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.960]
Yeah to apply to people but nevertheless yeah

[00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:36.960]
Stampede what would you call it?

[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.600]
I don't know stampede. I guess okay

[00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.680]
Color terrible disaster 21 people dead and

[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.540]
That was another thing speaking to people being edgy

[00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:51.340]
They thought because a couple of their friends have it only got sick and we're like passing out inside their club right poison

[00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.540]
I assume that they assumed that it was poison

[00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.260]
Yeah, right because we're all getting

[00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.040]
Where would they get that idea? I don't know maybe from the federal government or some

[00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:04.840]
Panic man, I don't know and so they all started hitting for the exits because they wanted to get out as fast as they could and

[00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.140]
Escape the poison gas that wasn't there in the first place and a whole bunch of people died

[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.840]
Speaking of that Japanese tourist are arrested with gas canister and grill at Miami Airport

[00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.740]
Now what why could we possibly have a call on there already that never happens on this show?

[00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.540]
I just noticed out of the corner my eye Fort Lauderdale. Hey, how you doing?

[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:31.140]
Okay, sir. All right. It's good to have you back. Yes, it is. Oh, yeah, George did a okay job

[00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.020]

[00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.860]
I was um chillin' for the last night, right? You know, I'm away

[00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:10.060]
Driving somewhere and I'm happy to catch some of the limbaugh and I was just one last night

[00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.940]
No, it was early evening big around three o'clock

[00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:26.920]
It's a good thing I do give the time because for people like you there a little bit confused early evening early evening is three o'clock

[00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:34.640]
I'm just trying to get high coordinates right I see well what did Lord asked have to say that the screw your mind up so bad

[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:41.320]
I just wanted to see I just want to hear him try to blame this on label lick and blame it on somebody else

[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.320]
They want this one

[00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:50.240]
Why strike that was going on the process in that we don't like strike? No the process in that thing going on

[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.280]
Yeah, and I'm sure enough he done labeled it and labeled it on of it

[00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:01.340]
Yeah, well don't make them a stick again and get a new phone. Thank you. That was great and a watch would be good and a watch would be excellent

[00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:07.060]
And like a compass and a road map would be excellent too. It was listening on his way to somewhere last night the Lord asked

[00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:10.880]
Then it turned out it was like no early in the evening like about three o'clock

[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:23.220]
Well, it's only me but I find that most amused yeah, especially since the call is from South Florida the land of the lost

[00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:28.700]
Sir don't take it personally because you're a wonderful guy, but you're just a little bit confused and lost you hit right in

[00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:35.580]
Anyway, Japanese tourists was arrested after carrying a canister a gasoline that a barbecue grilled through Miami International Airport, Poli said

[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:43.020]
out sushi ishi guru 45 was charged with creating a potential safety hazard Friday in a violation of airport security directives

[00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:48.980]
Poli said this is from the Boston Harold website. How come it took so long to get this on there? I just found this this morning

[00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:10.340]
He told me had a little gas and his canister

Ishi girl was taken into custody when he refused to give up the canister two boxes of matches and a barbecue grill

[00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:17.860]
We're also found in his possession

Sounds logical to made on it sure of course you're gonna have a barbecue grill

[00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:27.800]
You gotta have some gas and some matches authorities became more suspicious after examining Ishi girl's passport

Well, we order like on rock radio. We see the time and temp correct temperature. It says here is M look at that

[00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:36.740]

Wasn't that propitious that I just did that I checked for the temperature

[00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:45.020]

[00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:02.580]
Then change the way you feel everyday by sleeping on a great mattress from dollar mattress

So anyway, I heard at the ass end of Moe show there this morning

[00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:15.220]
He was sent at this kid the Steve Beckler who died from heat stroke the world's picture that he was taken pills with a fed rain

[00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:20.600]
Right now I just printed out the latest the very latest updated story from sports illustrated on this

[00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:27.420]
And they still haven't done the octopsie Brawich County Medical Examiner doctor Joshua purpose said a bottle of pills was found in Beckler's locker

[00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:30.900]
But it was unclear if he had taken any of them or if they contributed to his death

[00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:36.600]
The octopsie said would help determine that asked about reports the pills were a supplement containing a fed rain pepper said

[00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:41.260]
He didn't know what type of pills they were saying they could be anything from medication to vitamins

[00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:46.240]
Okay, I just mentioned that now maybe there was some other information here that they knew on a morning show do you think?

[00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:49.420]
I don't think oh well that's good

[00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:52.460]
That's probably just as well when you work on that place don't think too much now

[00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:55.680]
You notice that pause there in the last break before I hit the acute yes

Now you're gonna hear a lot of those you want to know why was that because I'm just I'm taking an easy next day

[00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:04.140]
By all means just here's the I don't want to feel stressed and pressed

They need to loosen it up a little bit

[00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:13.620]

We're not on a real uh oh we're here at QA I'm looking for a read I mean that's that in itself speaks volumes now

[00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:25.460]
Take it every bit as seriously as they do

[00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:27.980]
Very well said I think George

[00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:34.860]
That is an excellent uh view on a way we should do things from now on from this moment forward

[00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:38.460]
We're gonna take our jobs just as seriously the whole this whole business

[00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:42.400]
And a whole QA M experience just as seriously as management prize

[00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:43.500]

[00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:01.920]
Anyway, I see there's a change in the schedule. I'm not touching that with your tongue, okay

[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:10.140]
Uh Tuesday February 18th and looking at the schedule and I see a change on here that was just facts to me and it looks uh very very important

[00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:16.140]
U.M. A Providence basketball cancel last night for obvious reasons because of the horrendous weather

[00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:21.080]
And so it's gonna be on tonight but not on QA because we got the Panthers at the Cunodians

[00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:23.940]
So we got on Waxi 790

[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:30.860]
Oh my right we got that game of some time it doesn't bother putting the I guess uh 730

[00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:32.840]
I'm assuming I

[00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:37.640]
Nobody cares anyway. No, no, I mean you know they put all this stuff on there like uh, you know

[00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:42.100]
It's something to do clearance. I guess it's something to keep you busy and make you look very program directorish

[00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:48.140]
But nobody gives a crap oh my oh my Waxi 790 good golly miss Molly, you know

[00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:49.920]
How about a half an inch of snow here in Toronto?

[00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:53.560]
I guess I already mentioned that but just so you don't feel too bad for me not not too much

[00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:57.120]
Still a little bit of few flakes out there but warming up almost to uh

[00:17:58.060 --> 00:17:58.820]
Acceptable stages

[00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:02.160]
Here's the a poll for today which we're gonna put together again

[00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:07.540]
Now some people in the audience are gonna say oh you're not doing a movie pull again two days in a row are you yeah?

[00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:08.220]
Why not?

[00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:12.580]
Really it went over so well yesterday was phenomenal

[00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:14.940]
Don't you think yeah

[00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:19.240]
I usually have a couple of bedtime stories and I also have the tabloids for example

[00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:22.920]
I've got a choice what I'm gonna do is like mix and match all the jack-o stories

[00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:25.120]
So I can jack-o

[00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:27.360]
Interest them with uh what

[00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:33.200]
Powerful I'm I'm just saying that they're all so good between the globe the star and the inquirer

[00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:36.360]
And then of course Lisa Maria and not the Lisa Marie Debbie Roe

[00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:41.780]
He counts exclusively her globe reader is the intimate details of her marriage to the king of pop yeah

[00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:47.700]
Which of course was a sham the boys and his bed her tragic miscarriage and the mystery of the frozen placenta ooh

[00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:52.040]
It's mystery the truth behind the Peter Pan nose job

[00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:57.440]
And all of these things so basically most of the stuff that was good in the tabloids was about Michael

[00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:02.240]
I've re I've discovered why there are so many people obsessed with Michael Jackson again in these stories

[00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:06.640]
You want to know why don't please lay that on us because it has nothing to do with Iraq and the war oh

[00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:13.020]
Good point now. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe I'm just taking the easy way out like that bitch said to you that one day a month or two ago

[00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:19.260]
Maybe it's a cop-up, but the fact of the matter is I think there's a certain burnout factor if you catch my drift

[00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:20.940]
Ha ha ha ha ha

[00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:25.520]
Just a little bit of a burnout. Yeah, and they're also they're dropping rumors

[00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:28.660]
I think they're trying to you know lay it to us gently

[00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:34.920]
That any time of the next couple of days the orange alert which I know what a CNN is finally dropped MSNBC still has it on there

[00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:36.740]
I don't know about foxes. I don't watch them

[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:40.240]
But the orange alert may be ruled back to yellow

[00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:44.360]
So we don't have to be quite so hysterical anymore and a lot of people are gonna be really pissed off

[00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:46.240]
You know the people who went out there and bought the duck tape on

[00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:51.240]
Of his queen and this queen and that queen they're gonna be pissed off. Maybe they're gonna take it back

[00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:52.580]
Oh

[00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:59.620]
I hope they put no refunds at home people on all the crap that they sold to people no refunds. Well keep it for a cloudy day

[00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:06.620]
For a mushroom cloudy day. I keep it handy just in case a radioactive cloudy day because come to fight out that some of the

[00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:11.760]
Good part of the rationale that they got everybody all panicky about came from a an unreliable

[00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:15.440]
Alcatta prisoner who lied they give a lie detector test they said wow

[00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:19.600]
He lied. It's a bunch of bull crap

[00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:24.400]

[00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:27.880]

Here's the list we have so far very short list

[00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:51.880]
And I'm sure the audience will come through with flying colors again today

[00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:58.980]
And we don't want to have what was the most erotic movie you've ever seen not x rated not what were the 50 most erotic movies

[00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:02.200]

Blue lagoon

[00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:07.520]
Yeah, I thought it was only me though

[00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:09.820]
Put that down. But that was the first one you mentioned this morning. Sure

[00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:11.940]

Mall Holland Drive which uh, and I did you actually see the part of it where they had to die seen and all the boobs and stuff

[00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:31.460]

[00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:33.120]

[00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:44.620]
Interspersing a couple like the marine doubt column is pretty good

[00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:49.320]

Gangrate is funny. Okay, 932 and 560 WDQAM

[00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:16.600]
Oh, I should apologize to the Dwight-Eyes now our fans out there the I like I crowd

[00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:23.340]
Was that because yesterday was president's day. I mentioned everybody except two Andrew Johnson and Ike

[00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:26.320]
Oh, you wouldn't got the almond act. I didn't go and get the oh

[00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:33.920]
One of my areas of expertise. I don't have too many harness racing drivers from 100 years ago and presidents

[00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:37.220]
I know those anything else forget about it. What about hot gay sex?

[00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:42.960]
The little bit. Okay, most dramatic movie and see the right away. They got two fatal attraction

[00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:45.720]

Anything on your just like yesterday. I give you that the fight club and you what and I kind of about your votes

[00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:56.540]
It's just a commentary not like we're not gonna put it on or nothing fatal attraction

[00:25:56.920 --> 00:26:01.400]
The reason it wasn't quite as sexual as it might have been is because Michael Douglas was in it and Glenn close

[00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:05.400]
Don't get too close. Uh-huh and

[00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:06.500]
two chocolate

[00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:12.960]
Okay, where's that chocolate day? There's a line there. I don't know if that's an accent or if it's just a

[00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:14.400]
Chocolate

[00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:19.440]
What is that what it is? Whatever they know what it did they know it's show a lot. What is it?

[00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:25.360]
Should they go to the board movie show a lot? No, they talk a lot. Oh

[00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:29.820]
Okay, great go up to a great start

[00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:36.620]

[00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:43.280]
Our neurotic webmaster. Okay, I'm gonna give it a two of them. I'll take it up everything just don't start

[00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:47.100]
Like I said, I'll let you know when we send the first batch up there

[00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:51.740]
And then we'll get that on there so we can get some votes started right away instead of like waiting until later on today

[00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:57.320]
You do understand that not everybody has the ability to sit for on tar four hours or like a later on in the day

[00:26:57.320 --> 00:26:59.360]
You know when it gets late in the afternoon like about midnight

[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:02.460]
We're walking about these things

[00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:08.600]
You know some taking a nice long pause here that's take your breath

[00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:14.440]
I am just why the hell should I like you said you hit it right on the nose. Why should we take it any more seriously than they do

[00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:20.060]
And anybody that's watched Greg Reed in the way he's mishandled this operation the last five plus years in fact

[00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:23.280]
Even before I was thinking about it last night to show how depressed I am oh god

[00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:28.140]
Even before we ever before I ever started you already been the flunky there the copy flunky

[00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:31.260]
Yeah, but before I ever started he was playing the shenanigans well

[00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:36.620]
Tough calls to tell Neal a Greg had him called because the studio isn't gonna be ready by December 30th

[00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:40.580]
This is like months and months and months and months after we signed the deal right

[00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:43.720]
Oh, it's not gonna be ready and that was just the beginning

[00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:47.480]
And of course there was also the other thing about part of my a paid that I had coming that they

[00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:53.320]
You didn't want to pay that he had to write me a personal check because it was too embarrassing because the beesleys didn't want to pay it

[00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:57.680]
And that was just the beginning of a wonderful relationship Greg you're just you're the best

[00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:00.620]
Here's for a lottery. Hello

[00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:06.420]
Yeah, sir, yes, sir your chronic movies. I was going nine and a half weeks

[00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:10.740]
That's funny you should say that because when we talked about this yesterday

[00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:16.580]
George said for sure nine and a half weeks is gonna be one of the first ones I'll call in absolutely and the other will be a manual

[00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:22.420]
The manual that's a good one which one there's been a hundred I know that for the first one. All right

[00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:24.720]
But are you sure that wasn't ex-rated some of the more?

[00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:28.000]
I don't believe it well. I don't know. I have weeks was not

They made you all make up. Yeah, I'll have to look at up. Okay. Thanks the manual that wasn't how's that

[00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:36.060]

[00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:49.900]
Yeah, do the spell check. Okay, cuz our neurotic web mice didn't like to make spelling mistakes

[00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:54.260]
Just relax Eric. Okay. We're just having some fun of your expenses usual. Just calm down

[00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:57.960]
I think it's an air route. Quick be in such a grouchy fat cow

5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T see I'm I'm just as a matter of fact

[00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:07.040]
I get a call yesterday from Duff in the middle of the afternoon

[00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:11.940]
Unacceptable. I mean, I don't mind hearing from it if he got something really important to tell me

[00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:18.520]
I he can call something really like major you know like the like the station just blew up something like that heaven for bid

[00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:19.480]
See what I'm saying?

[00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:23.980]
No, what are you saying anything short of that for the next couple of weeks. I don't want to hear from anybody

[00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:30.160]
Nobody seems to understand and I don't want to like dwell on it because I feel pretty good. That sound great

[00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:30.640]
Yeah

[00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:33.000]
But other than that I'm

[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:38.120]
Each day after you have a stroke each day your brain on skit see your brain has to heal

[00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:40.180]
Do you understand new pathways new?

[00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:43.500]
Understand that there are cells that die on your stroke, right?

[00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:47.140]
And your brain has to heal and you have this feeling of like all this blood in the top of your head

[00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:50.020]
Which you do obviously have blood, but you feel it, you know, right?

[00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:54.200]
And then each day it gets a little progressively better and better and like today

[00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:57.880]
It's a lot better and yesterday when I thought like about 11 o'clock. I was just gonna say hey, I'll see you

[00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:00.680]
But somehow I persevered now if that would have happened today

[00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:04.060]
I just said hey, I'll do a Gregory now just take a five-hour lunch

[00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:07.240]
So be nice guy and trying to do the right thing

[00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:09.620]
He called to tell me what he could have called me and told me this morning

[00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:13.640]
Which he did about the billboards this and but I mean better about all this other stuff

[00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:16.620]
Don't call me Duff. Okay, I know he's listening right now. He's doing his duty

[00:30:16.620 --> 00:30:20.480]
Not that I don't like talking to your wonderful guy. You're a great American in yadda yadda yadda

[00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:22.500]
But don't bug me. Okay. Leave me alone

[00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:25.420]
If Jody wants to call now, that's another story

[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:30.920]
Or if the neurotic webmeister if he wants to call that's another story because at that point I will have the phone disconnected

[00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:35.440]
Here's Miami. Hello

Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. Yeah, I had to actually the previous call it to call it my first one

[00:30:40.820 --> 00:30:44.620]
None and a half. Okay, now I think we gotta do it. We got a limited to two. Do you think that's a good idea?

[00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:47.580]
Yeah, yeah, let's a little bit to two go ahead

[00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:49.580]
Basic instincts

[00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:52.260]
Okay, what's the one that I had?

[00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:56.940]
Nine and a half weeks where it was the other but I also want to let you know that Emmanuel was an X-rated movie unfortunately

[00:30:56.940 --> 00:30:59.880]
I will be a crystal. Okay. I'll just cross it out

[00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:06.540]
But my point my my picks were nine and a half weeks and basic instincts. Okay. Good ones. Thanks. Thank you

[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.540]
You're welcome manual. I crossed out. It's x-rated

[00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:11.960]
And it's not like one of those euro

[00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:15.380]
It's an x-rated flick. We're not putting x-rated flickers

[00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:19.260]
Then you'll have Debbie does Dallas and you'll have a see more butts and see more whatever

[00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:26.240]
We don't want to we're not gonna put those on there. We already done that stuff anyway. Didn't we we did the favorite porno star

[00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:28.280]
Must have been while I was out

[00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:32.180]
Maybe it's like I don't know maybe seven or eight years ago. Maybe it was on like another channel

[00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:34.860]
Maybe it was another lifetime. I don't know it seems seems we did

[00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:38.640]
Could have been when you weren't there because we didn't want to embarrass you with all that stuff right

[00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:44.520]
5 6 7 0 5 7 8 5 60 on the 18 the most erotic movie you've ever seen

[00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:51.060]
Not x-rated in other words the kind of a movie where you'd like to sit real close to the screen and get a grip on life

[00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:54.920]
You thought what I'm saying you got very emotional. I thought I know right

[00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:58.040]
Kind of like in the old days watching the parkridge family

[00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:02.280]
What are you laughing about this is no laughing matter mister?

[00:32:03.260 --> 00:32:06.140]
It was either Susan. They are all and or David Cassidy

The breathless wonder what would he do if we weren't here every day

[00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:33.500]
Masterbait to somebody else I guess I guess

[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:37.100]

Well the ones who like one of those still vote for it

[00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:25.220]
I was gonna say if other ones come along later on it can't change their vote

[00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:31.180]
Right, so sometimes it's not a good idea to put it on too early until we have a much more substantialist

[00:34:31.180 --> 00:34:37.100]
But that's okay put it up there anyway. It'll give what's his name something to do 941 at 560 WQM

[00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:36.280]
There's nothing like really good head and you got that headset on oh my god

[00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:40.840]
Feel it feel like you had your head one of those like like a long scan

[00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:44.740]
You know and one of those things where they like put the thing over your head and like lock it up real tight

[00:39:45.340 --> 00:39:49.740]
And it feels like they're gonna squish your brains out of your head. Maybe that's what happened a Greg long time ago, you know

[00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:52.380]
You know

[00:39:52.380 --> 00:39:54.280]
Here's a call from Tamara. Hello

[00:39:54.280 --> 00:40:00.060]
Neil. Yes, sir. How you doing great. I saw a movie way back in the 70s

[00:40:00.060 --> 00:40:03.460]
I think it was Richard Hard it was body heat

[00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:07.660]
Body what body heat body heat

[00:40:08.220 --> 00:40:12.820]
It was a hot movie it steamed up my glass William hurt Kathleen Turner. It was pretty hot. Oh, yeah

[00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:15.420]
I remember that that was pretty good. That was excellent long time ago. You're right

[00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:22.240]
Okay, good choice. Thank you. Thank you so much. Just put your backses that said that as a matter of fact. Did they really?

[00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:28.320]
Well, let me reach back here on my trusty fax machine. It seems to work a hell of a lot better than the one down there. It'll fall over

[00:40:30.140 --> 00:40:32.380]
Let's see. Oh, this is a suggestion for another poll

[00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:40.860]
From Tom what's most likely to happen a terrorist attack and attack by Iraq or North Korea losing your health care coverage

[00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:46.960]
Retirement benefits or job or push reducing the 400 billion dollar defense budget by a few billion to feed the poor and hungry

[00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:52.780]
For Tom, I guess Tom hasn't taken off of that ginkgo baloba or maybe too much. I'm not really sure

[00:40:52.780 --> 00:40:54.520]
Here's one. It says out of sight

[00:40:55.100 --> 00:40:57.200]

[00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:16.740]

Did I tell him that because Carlos was emailing it to him? Oh, he's emailing oh, I hate that. I hate this emailing crap

[00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:28.540]
That that's why we get all screwed up. You know call me old-fashioned and I do a little bit of email

[00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:33.260]
Although I noticed Lynn Samuels hasn't emailed me last couple days. I wonder if she's very net snowstorm in New York

[00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:35.620]
You what you think? What's going on Lynn?

[00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:38.720]

[00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:49.040]
Well, oh, here's a good one. Yeah, this is definitely a in a very kind of like tender way the summer of 42 was it tender

[00:41:49.900 --> 00:41:54.820]
Huh, I forgot it. I thought it long time ago get out of here with Jennifer O'Neill and Gary's grime

[00:41:55.620 --> 00:41:59.960]
Don't you remember Gary grime you get to see your cookies in that movie then they had the class of 44

[00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:04.760]
Which was the sequel which they should have gotten about where they had the guys the fraternity initiation thing

[00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:06.760]
They had a tie the belt of their shlong. Oh God

[00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:11.060]

[00:42:11.940 --> 00:42:12.340]

[00:42:13.380 --> 00:42:17.280]
Summer of 42. Okay, I son. I got that guy who's writing these down Carlos

[00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:21.140]
I'm writing them down. We're verifying during the break. It's second so on you're very well

[00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:23.600]
I'm doing checks and balances going on over. I see well

[00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:27.440]
Let's get this one right okay because the entire future of the human race is hinging on our pool

[00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:32.500]
And we will not be talking about Joe million or today if you want to hear about Joe million or turn on lardass when he comes on

[00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:33.660]
This evening about midnight

[00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:39.520]
Tracy says my one vote and like you just said body heat somebody must have had a psychic

[00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:41.000]
Something

[00:42:41.580 --> 00:42:43.740]
We're in cappling turners to look like a woman

[00:42:44.460 --> 00:42:48.020]
And sounded like one too now she looks more like Ted Turner right there

[00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:52.720]

[00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:59.240]
Tracy had a sudden she came back to her real fast good choice there Tracy. Thank you

[00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:02.320]
Good choice. She suddenly can't got her senses back

[00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:09.240]
But we're building a nice like there summer of 42 that was a very you know it was kind of like stand by me

[00:43:10.660 --> 00:43:17.840]
You know the youthful sex exploration and the Gary Grimes and his boyfriend and a reading the sex books and their drawn pictures of body parts and whatever else

[00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:23.460]
And then finally uh her uh husband was it her husband? I guess her husband is a hundred years ago

[00:43:23.460 --> 00:43:25.460]
She got the telegram and her husband died in the award

[00:43:26.180 --> 00:43:31.420]
And she gets the telegram and she's of course crying and just the totally distraught and Gary Grimes comes in

[00:43:31.900 --> 00:43:33.600]
And she undresses him

[00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:43.260]
And hops in the sack and then of course he never sees Ray the movie he starts out and then at the end the narration of Gary Grimes is an adult

[00:43:43.260 --> 00:43:47.860]
There are few movies like that. Do you know what I mean? Yeah, it's like a flashback kind of like Joe Gerstin, you know

[00:43:48.940 --> 00:43:52.680]
Where he's flashing back on his days in glory by the way Joey

[00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:57.540]
What do we do with a Mercedes Joe? A lot of people have been wondering that he left the Mercedes behind her right

[00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:02.620]

[00:44:03.420 --> 00:44:06.380]

So Joe Rose will be on for man dog today one to three Hank Goldberg three to seven four four hours an upper day

[00:44:16.100 --> 00:44:18.760]
Well, I hope he's a training. I hope we lost an answer to it

[00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:23.700]
And then we got the shiko panther and people with seven eight panthers at the Montreal Canadian 7th 3rd night

[00:44:23.700 --> 00:44:30.180]
To play the frogs 80k from GA after the hockey game and Joe and Mark overnight who are really pissed off that they can't get their own website

[00:44:30.820 --> 00:44:32.860]
So they're using some kind of temporary thing

[00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:39.520]
Because clearance doesn't want them to have their own website because it might it might take a couple of hits away from the QAM

[00:44:39.980 --> 00:44:40.380]
Website

[00:44:40.380 --> 00:44:45.300]
You know the sports intensive website and since clearance is part of the evil sports fraternity there

[00:44:45.300 --> 00:44:48.000]
He don't want that to happen and don't forget whatever you do the u.m

[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:53.000]

The Madonna one but the I forget the name of the actress it is but it was some Italian chick more. I'll look it up for it

She was the same actress that was in flash Gordon as one of Ming's evil hench women

[00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:40.380]
But you don't know who it is. Well, she's worrying like a thing over her head so you can't recognize her not like some Italian swept away by an usual destiny in the blue sea of august

[00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:46.020]

I thought cinema paradise always kind of erotic too, but was huh

[00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:39.660]
It was not an erotic movie the only thing I remember is the little kid peeing in the gargoyle

[00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:32.200]
And if that's what we have to do to get him under 200 pounds. That's what we'll do

[00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:37.460]
Anyway, if you'd like to lose the way to not be sick and fat and believe me the two go hand in hand

[00:47:37.460 --> 00:47:40.340]
There's synonymous you can't be fat and healthy

[00:47:41.180 --> 00:47:47.220]
And I don't want to mention the thing about Steve Beckler again the picture that died. You know what he was that fat out of shape

[00:47:47.220 --> 00:47:52.700]
He I mean really fat. They showed some clips of him in spring training this morning on the news. He was a chubby boy

[00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:57.000]
And he's out there in a heat and he gets heat prostration. He had a body temperature of 108

[00:47:57.680 --> 00:48:02.740]
And his organs were failing and they're very sad but fat makes you sick. Try take it from me. I know

[00:48:02.740 --> 00:48:07.980]

I thought I said it this morning

[00:50:34.440 --> 00:50:38.500]
You said it yesterday when I mentioned the possibility of doing this pool today about the most erotic movie

[00:50:38.500 --> 00:50:40.180]
You said that's what they're going to be voting

[00:50:40.180 --> 00:50:41.460]

Have you taken your ginkgo balloba? I'll take you, so you forgot to take it again

[00:50:46.660 --> 00:50:51.720]

Fatal attraction appear last tango and paris appear

[00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:06.180]
The postman always rings twice one blue lagoon one what i was mine sorry

[00:51:06.180 --> 00:51:12.020]
Uh basic instinct one body he won and summer lover is one and that's it so far

[00:51:13.620 --> 00:51:15.560]
A long way to go you know what

[00:51:16.660 --> 00:51:20.780]
Lot of votes to count the late return will come in and maybe I don't know you think good

[00:51:20.780 --> 00:51:24.660]
I don't have what's the big deal with i don't have weeks see it would be erotic a kinbasin or naked

[00:51:24.660 --> 00:51:28.500]
It would be erotic if it weren't for Mickey Rork in there. Oh see he nullified it

[00:51:28.500 --> 00:51:29.480]
He worked was in there

[00:51:30.140 --> 00:51:34.300]
With his greasy hair and oh my god you have to be smitten me

[00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:39.340]
The Rorkmeister he might be listening right now by the way the big big fan of the show

[00:51:39.340 --> 00:51:42.340]
He loves to hate this show like poison all we haven't heard about him in a long time

[00:51:42.340 --> 00:51:44.280]
I don't come from a place where somebody says

[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:48.720]
My come gonna walk away. Okay. I don't know. Maybe you're from a different planet

[00:51:48.720 --> 00:51:56.700]
Yeah, we could be from a different planet. Let's hope so five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on a AT&T and Verizon wireless line

[00:51:57.800 --> 00:51:58.860]
Fort Lauderdale hello

[00:52:01.240 --> 00:52:01.800]
Hello

[00:52:01.800 --> 00:52:03.180]
Fort Lauderdale hello

[00:52:03.180 --> 00:52:07.900]
Yes, sir. Yes, you're feeling better. Thanks. First the correction. It was

[00:52:07.900 --> 00:52:14.640]
Jessica Lang with Nicholson and the postman only rings twice not Kathleen Turner. Okay, and then

[00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:19.420]
I have two and they're both Ellen Barkin movies one is Sea of Love

[00:52:20.580 --> 00:52:24.860]
And the other one that I don't recall the name of it it came out a couple years ago

[00:52:24.860 --> 00:52:30.820]
She plays a detective and she investigates a murder that involves a club of

[00:52:31.600 --> 00:52:36.160]
It's a lesbian club and she kind of gets drawn into it really yeah

[00:52:36.860 --> 00:52:43.740]
Both very good movies somebody will know that one. Okay. Thanks. Yeah. Okay. Sea of Love one of my favorite songs by Phil Phillips

[00:52:43.740 --> 00:52:49.300]
And then the honeydrippers made it which sure was pointless. Why do they do that to make money the money money trippers

[00:52:49.820 --> 00:52:54.520]
The money drippers I need when the song is redone that never should have been redone in the front

[00:52:54.520 --> 00:52:59.500]
In fact, that would be a good pull right that would be an excellent pull what was what song was remade

[00:53:00.120 --> 00:53:03.880]
Uh, that never should have been made in the first place. I mean, there's some way to word that right

[00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:05.460]
I'm not sure I do that to not know what you mean

[00:53:05.960 --> 00:53:10.200]
You know what I mean sure in fact, I like to impose when the audience can't exactly figure out what we mean

[00:53:10.200 --> 00:53:13.680]
Because then they really get all screwed up sea of love with Ellen

[00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:20.180]
Looks like she took a bad hit to the face Barkin really. Oh god. Maybe that's why it's out of her mouth her mouth is crooked

[00:53:20.180 --> 00:53:24.500]
Yeah, not to mention the rest of her face, which is also crooked and so that's pretty erotic to me

[00:53:24.520 --> 00:53:24.800]
Yeah

[00:53:25.620 --> 00:53:26.100]
erotic

[00:53:26.680 --> 00:53:30.660]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on a AT&T line

[00:53:30.660 --> 00:53:33.660]
It's just changing for the first time over here. Let's take a look

[00:53:34.200 --> 00:53:38.520]
Nine and a half weeks has got eight body heat for the two moon moon junction three

[00:53:39.560 --> 00:53:44.480]
Unfaithful three and then the Mahal and drives got a pair blue lagoon's got two somebody else out there enjoyed blue lagoon

[00:53:44.480 --> 00:53:49.640]
Of course, they probably enjoyed Brooke Bush shields and her body double

[00:53:51.340 --> 00:53:55.400]
Well, that's right. She had a stunt double in her because she used to be a taken on a

[00:53:55.400 --> 00:54:01.520]
Yeah, she knows you know, poor little Brooke in that stuff. Well, she didn't pretty pay this is the same 14 year old

[00:54:01.520 --> 00:54:07.320]
She was 14 years old. She was doing those Levi's ads or whatever they were slapping her ass on the thing on the cheeks

[00:54:08.280 --> 00:54:09.720]
Yeah, but you didn't see nipple

[00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:14.220]
God forbid so Burke shield and Chris Atkins. No forget about him

[00:54:14.220 --> 00:54:16.680]
I did mention before the show to George that last night

[00:54:16.680 --> 00:54:20.780]
I saw about five minutes of a movie called if it's Tuesday it must be Belgium

[00:54:21.780 --> 00:54:24.600]
That we've all heard of that movie, but did anybody ever actually see it

[00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:28.060]
No, nobody ever saw it

[00:54:28.060 --> 00:54:32.000]
So I saw part of it last night and it was about these American tourists around a tour bus

[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:37.700]
And they visit a whole bunch of different European countries in like 16 days or something and they spent a couple of days in Holland

[00:54:37.700 --> 00:54:39.960]
It amps the damn and a couple days in Belgium, etc

[00:54:40.920 --> 00:54:45.800]
And a cameo appearance in that movie by the lovely Luke Halpin who played the Sandion flipper

[00:54:46.460 --> 00:54:52.120]
When he was just a little punk when he was flippin it and here was the Luke Halpin had a little cameo near about three four minutes

[00:54:53.440 --> 00:54:56.500]
Was about I let's see 1969 he would have been about what George

[00:54:57.560 --> 00:55:02.840]
Yes, can they but I just a joke just a little bit all of the type because just a joke probably about 20 years old

[00:55:02.840 --> 00:55:05.220]
Looked really good could I use the next dream meal or two there?

[00:55:05.620 --> 00:55:08.460]
I know if I'd have been an Amsterdam at the time I'd have fed him a couple of extra meals

[00:55:08.460 --> 00:55:14.160]
But nevertheless Luke Halpin looking pretty good. We love you Luke. Even though you're old now and kind of a sour poise

[00:55:14.620 --> 00:55:17.880]
Ever since that morning we called him live on Zeta on the earth, but he

[00:55:17.880 --> 00:55:20.900]
He booked up a little bit he became a preacher. Do you know that no?

[00:55:21.080 --> 00:55:23.960]
I didn't became a preacher or some kind of a born again guy boy

[00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:28.700]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the 18 now. We'll say this

[00:55:29.400 --> 00:55:32.040]
Oh wait a minute. There's a return to the blue lagoon

[00:55:32.760 --> 00:55:33.120]
Yes

[00:55:34.980 --> 00:55:40.140]
Mila Jovovich and I don't know that the guy is right. Yeah, how the guy sure is a hell lot better looking and Chris Atkins ever dreamed

[00:55:40.140 --> 00:55:43.880]
I had a much more ample penis all the way never saw. Yeah, but hey listen

[00:55:43.880 --> 00:55:46.500]
It just had to be you know return to the blue lagoon

[00:55:46.500 --> 00:55:51.080]
It's right on there. I'm writing it on there right right. Do I want it on there? Are you crazy?

[00:55:51.420 --> 00:55:52.960]
I'm gonna have to change my vote

[00:55:53.520 --> 00:55:57.000]
Because you turned them because paradise was Willie Ames and

[00:55:58.160 --> 00:55:58.800]
Phoebe case

[00:56:01.600 --> 00:56:06.980]
Phoebe case the bird was a big fan of Phoebe if our Phoebe Kates because and I think Phoebe King too

[00:56:07.840 --> 00:56:12.480]
Because he said she was voyish and goish and I think the boys part is what he was attracted to most

[00:56:12.480 --> 00:56:22.260]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on a return to the blue lagoon should be noted that Mila actually does share her nipples with us in that movie unlike brook

[00:56:22.260 --> 00:56:28.520]
I see well that was the real Mila okay, it's supposed to brook that pussy ice brook. She was too busy hanging out with Michael Jackson

[00:56:29.420 --> 00:56:35.440]
Oh, oh, well wasn't that wasn't yes. I think even before maybe not before because Liz was always there

[00:56:36.080 --> 00:56:36.880]
Brook Shields was

[00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:41.440]
Yeah, what's your and the chip and bubbles? Oh

[00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:46.460]
Good God. Oh, I was dating Michael. Yeah, she started talking like him too

[00:56:47.220 --> 00:56:48.340]
Here's Miami. Hello

[00:56:49.760 --> 00:56:52.720]
Miami when is this hello? Yes, sir?

[00:56:53.340 --> 00:57:00.140]
Yeah, what about the movie monster ball with Hollywood? What was it monster ball with Hollywood?

[00:57:00.680 --> 00:57:01.660]
Monster balls

[00:57:02.420 --> 00:57:03.140]
Monster's ball

[00:57:04.100 --> 00:57:09.300]
Monster's ball. Hollywood. Billy Bob Thornton. I understand that there's hot sex in there and you actually get to see his monster ball

[00:57:10.320 --> 00:57:15.400]
Monster's ball. I didn't know how they very head monster balls. Maybe that's why she's having all that problem with the

[00:57:15.400 --> 00:57:22.920]
That's on the tabloids but the sex seven does one good sex scene in a movie making an erotic movie even the movies not erotic at all

[00:57:22.920 --> 00:57:29.760]
It's a matter of your choice. That's the point whatever it is that turns you on okay whatever cranks your chain

[00:57:29.760 --> 00:57:35.780]
However desperate you are at the moment. What's the most erotic movie you've ever seen and the answer is

[00:57:37.660 --> 00:57:41.500]
Monster balls. No, but what was Carlos just gonna say what are you uh

[00:57:42.180 --> 00:57:47.820]
Are we asking I guess you must have seen that movie. I don't know. Yeah, yeah, because there's only one one really hot scene in it

[00:57:47.820 --> 00:57:54.380]
And the rest is has is not erotic at all. It's well this guy that just ball he liked it. Okay. He said it was a three-hanky job

[00:57:54.380 --> 00:57:55.540]
All right, so just leave him alone

[00:57:56.300 --> 00:57:59.220]
Okay, most erotic know the rabbi says angel heart

[00:57:59.960 --> 00:58:02.300]
I think that certainly qualifies. Don't it? Sure

[00:58:04.980 --> 00:58:07.100]
The rabbi shame on you

[00:58:07.100 --> 00:58:08.800]
He's been made with the gorge. It's is again

[00:58:09.640 --> 00:58:15.040]
Oh, here's another uh the saline who with Molly Ivan's that's pretty interesting you were talking to Scott Chape and again

[00:58:16.220 --> 00:58:22.160]
Huh, but what does that mean? I don't know which practice is were you talking to Scott Chape and again?

[00:58:22.320 --> 00:58:26.820]
Feel better still all I see about having the stroke because the first one you remember that no

[00:58:27.680 --> 00:58:32.480]
The first stroke I had at i.o.d. was run on the heels of that asshole Scott Chape and

[00:58:33.060 --> 00:58:37.900]
Making a big song dance because of the fact that I was talking about I played that thing on the ear

[00:58:38.640 --> 00:58:43.040]
That bill called her tape that bill had of that something from i.o.d from years ago

[00:58:43.040 --> 00:58:48.680]
Where Raniri was on air and Henry Burrow and Bill and they were all ripping each other whatever from some Christmas party or something

[00:58:48.680 --> 00:58:50.680]
And Phil costume was on there. Remember that?

[00:58:51.080 --> 00:58:55.560]
What was before my time that I remember the stories and I think that's what precipitated that

[00:58:56.200 --> 00:59:02.300]
In tempered display by Scott Chape and whose voices are on virtually every television station from coast to coast

[00:59:02.300 --> 00:59:05.760]
He's making more money than all of us put together, but nevertheless. He's an asshole. Okay

[00:59:06.380 --> 00:59:10.280]
Okay, I came in and just got me hysterical about that. Oh a lot of people are gonna have their feelings

[00:59:10.280 --> 00:59:12.780]
As if we care on the show other paintings

[00:59:12.780 --> 00:59:17.180]
You know, he was kind of like no. I he pretending he didn't get it and again underlining

[00:59:18.080 --> 00:59:23.200]
Pretending he doesn't get it another train monkey. Yeah, right exactly very well put mo

[00:59:23.640 --> 00:59:27.160]
And by the way if I have to I can't deal with it anymore hearing about tiger woods

[00:59:27.160 --> 00:59:29.460]
Maybe it's just bad luck or maybe maybe he's monitoring

[00:59:29.920 --> 00:59:35.000]
Maybe he knows what time I come sponsoring in here in the morning crawling in here in the studio and crank up the pot

[00:59:36.980 --> 00:59:42.020]
Every time I open up the pot he's talking about tiger woods and Ernie L's and oh that's gonna be so wonderful to say

[00:59:42.020 --> 00:59:46.320]
And tiger woods and then he wanted that thing about the effidring with the a pitcher and I'll say it again

[00:59:46.320 --> 00:59:51.280]
Both CNN and the sports illustrator the very latest article say they didn't know what was in a bottle

[00:59:51.280 --> 00:59:55.520]
Could have been vitamins. It could have been some of that stuff. They don't know they have to do the autopsy first

[00:59:57.300 --> 00:59:59.580]
I of course you don't worry about accuracy. Have you heard that show?

[01:00:00.860 --> 01:00:05.160]
No, it's not gonna happen. It's something something he's not concerned about and if you don't believe me just listen

[01:00:05.540 --> 01:00:10.340]
Uh, how about the movie personal best during burial himming way where she plays a lesbian Olympic athlete

[01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:15.340]
Merrill Hemingway doing lesbianism is a rotic. That's great. I saw it personal best

[01:00:16.580 --> 01:00:16.940]
Okay

[01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:21.680]
You're writing these down Carlos. Oh, yeah

[01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:24.880]
Georgia's writing them down. Oh look we got a horse race. Good

[01:00:26.380 --> 01:00:27.400]
How about body double

[01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:34.280]
Was that a lot of you know? Well, I think that was your rotic it sure did have some parts in it

[01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:36.160]
Sure because he was looking at his body

[01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:41.580]
No, seriously. No, you're right. Good. I got all about it. Put that on your body. Double leave it to me

[01:00:41.580 --> 01:00:44.160]
I remember that vividly. I saw it about six seven times. It was cute

[01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:49.380]
What was the most it was cute? Yeah, this is how the good plot you could dance to it

[01:00:50.140 --> 01:00:53.280]
What was the most erotic movie not x-rated you've ever seen is our pool today

[01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:56.180]
We're doing another pool just to piss off that guy to get very upset about pools

[01:00:56.860 --> 01:01:05.540]
That's because he won't sat on one hurt real bad nine and a half weeks 13 body heat 10 fatal attraction seven on faithful six

[01:01:06.260 --> 01:01:07.520]
two moon junction

[01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:09.060]
five

[01:01:09.060 --> 01:01:11.560]
Sureland fennful frontal by the way is why they're voting for that

[01:01:12.180 --> 01:01:17.760]
Kakamon junction blue lagoon four last hango and Paris four basic instinct three

[01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:21.260]
Last and then we got the twos and ones and something like that

[01:01:21.700 --> 01:01:26.900]
Look at my home drives only got one 64 votes so far to pull us up in up two minutes. So hop on it

[01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:32.920]
For all these other factors anymore. We would Johnny Devon and please add to the list well. We'll see in a movie that you call erotic

[01:01:34.100 --> 01:01:37.000]
I don't know the problem one to mark. Oh, I have no no

[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:40.080]
They've always been there. Have to be a freak. That's the problem with him

[01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:45.680]
He never looks like he should like good ed wood. He dressed in drag. That's erotic. Did he pop wood in Ed wood?

[01:01:47.180 --> 01:01:47.580]
Huh

[01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:53.320]
I'm asking Nadine says asked my daughter to give me the scoop on her dating time with Johnny while in Miramar

[01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:55.780]
She was elected to give me the good details Julie's now 38

[01:01:55.780 --> 01:01:58.860]
I'm angry that she would be so close mouth. We've always shared anyway

[01:01:58.860 --> 01:02:03.100]
I've got Tom Raleigh Knight's love his face is Nadine right on Nadine's excellent taste

[01:02:03.100 --> 01:02:06.260]
There's a lady after my own heart. Okay, a real lady

[01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:10.680]
Johnny Devon if we can't have him good old Tom whirling

[01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:14.760]
Causes a little bit of a swelling for some and he'll be on tonight on smallville and mama

[01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:23.280]
Did you tell me that both of them mama and the Clark Jess become deathly ill and nobody can figure out why but I have a feeling at the end of the show by 10 o'clock tonight

[01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:28.920]
They'll be okay. Don't you think probably they seem to sew it all right up before the end

[01:02:29.300 --> 01:02:33.020]
Because they'll be coming back again next week. Hey, I'll tell you a place that's not the only okay

[01:02:33.020 --> 01:02:37.680]
It's great and that's the Emerald coast speak on Toronto my good friend Richard who is a big maple leaves fan

[01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:43.000]
He's from Toronto and the good news for you as he came down a South Florida several years ago to open the first Emerald coast in sunrise

[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.880]
And now they've expanded with three locations

[01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:48.180]
Besides sunrise there are North Miami beats in the newest location Pemper Pines

[01:02:48.180 --> 01:02:53.980]
Everybody wants to be the Emerald coast, but there's only the original okay because everybody else has got a Chinese buffet now

[01:02:53.980 --> 01:02:57.760]
They're not even the same category with the Emerald coast when you walk in the door

[01:02:57.760 --> 01:03:02.100]
You'll see what I'm talking about a sea of delicious fresh goodies everything fresh and crunchy

[01:03:02.100 --> 01:03:06.720]
Six different soups would probably aren't crunchy, but they're delicious and dozens of succulent entrees

[01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:10.640]
Not just Oriental but all kinds of other good stuff beef and chicken and pork and you name it

[01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:14.240]
Oriental surf and turf on the weekends New York strip steak made a word of the gourmet center

[01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:18.460]
That's a sizzling ashing grill with teriyaki steak shrimp chicken seafood hand-car primer

[01:03:18.460 --> 01:03:22.660]
The Emerald coast for most healthy living too because they don't use any crap no corn starch

[01:03:22.660 --> 01:03:26.840]
No MSG. They use only cholesterol free oils and all their cooking and believe me

[01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:29.720]
You'll feel the difference you'll ever walk out of there with a headache just a full public

[01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:34.520]
There were faith features of whole salad bar new sushi bar Greg and fresh room cocktail too

[01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:39.520]
And their famous lobster fest is back at Emerald coast featuring lobster thermators and lobster bisque

[01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:45.060]
One requirement is bring a gigantic appetite or crowbar and open up some room in your pants for the dessert bar

[01:03:45.060 --> 01:03:50.600]
Featuring pies and cakes pastries ice cream with all your favorite toppings and fresh fruit the perfect ending to a gigantic

[01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:53.760]
Unbelievable unparalleled feast you'll find them in sunrise

[01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:55.440]
Pine Island of 44th Street

[01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:58.360]
They're on Collins Avenue just north of 163rd North Miami Beach

[01:03:58.360 --> 01:04:02.120]
And you also find the Emerald coast at the intersection of flamingo and pember groves and pember pines

[01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:04.520]
The except reservations take underliverable as well

[01:04:04.520 --> 01:04:08.940]
Be sure and look for the new Oriental chicken salad when you hop in to the Emerald coast called 954

[01:04:10.540 --> 01:04:10.920]
5723822

[01:04:10.920 --> 01:04:14.160]
I think a lot of the people who eat there will not be hopping in you know what I mean

[01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:22.220]
Nobody more like waddling in some of those big porkers 954 5723822 for the world famous Emerald coast Chinese buffet

[01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:26.980]
Horse radio 560

[01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:07.640]
Why sure?

[01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:11.980]
Well, you're from New York, right?

[01:05:14.380 --> 01:05:17.540]
Now right fight down. I just flipped my wig again

[01:05:17.540 --> 01:05:19.520]

[01:05:38.340 --> 01:05:41.200]

[01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:41.840]

Well, they told me in no one's eight in times

[01:05:46.140 --> 01:05:47.620]
Let's not get in for that right now

[01:05:47.620 --> 01:05:49.080]
That sounds familiar

[01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:51.160]
So what you you hear the news?

[01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:54.640]

[01:05:54.860 --> 01:05:57.980]
No, they're gonna suspend that little hustle hulio

[01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:02.160]
That's right. They want to let that little spit bastard go

[01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:03.000]

[01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:05.940]

[01:06:29.900 --> 01:06:30.700]
What are you

[01:06:30.700 --> 01:06:31.880]
What are you

[01:06:31.880 --> 01:06:33.080]
What are you

[01:06:33.080 --> 01:06:33.780]
What are you

[01:06:33.780 --> 01:06:34.280]

[01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:37.080]
What are you

[01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:37.240]
What are you

[01:06:37.240 --> 01:06:38.080]
And by the way mo

[01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:38.900]
Break hate you

[01:06:38.900 --> 01:06:43.400]
Anyway 10 20 at 5 60 W to Q I M we're doing the most erotic movie you've ever seen

[01:06:43.400 --> 01:06:46.500]
Don't let me forget now behind the great divide by Paul Krugman

[01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:48.380]
Okay, don't forget

[01:06:48.380 --> 01:06:52.220]
It is one of the bedtime stories on our website today along with about a hundred million other ones

[01:06:52.580 --> 01:06:53.820]
But that's good. I mean really

[01:06:54.180 --> 01:06:58.240]
Excellent in terms of the difference of opinion about the whole Iraq thing in the US and the rest of the world

[01:06:58.240 --> 01:07:00.040]
Because of the news media

[01:07:00.700 --> 01:07:06.120]
Because of the way the stories are being presented and the fact that the news media here feel that they have to be like a bunch of cheerleaders

[01:07:06.900 --> 01:07:09.940]
At least some of them not to mention of course the Fox people who feel that

[01:07:09.940 --> 01:07:12.440]
The media is sick and they can't be happy

[01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:13.400]
That said, we saw it get to that

[01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:17.860]
Also the thing about the guy that access 2.2 million credit cards but hasn't used them yet

[01:07:18.820 --> 01:07:20.000]
Hey, what is that all about?

[01:07:20.780 --> 01:07:21.260]
Well, he's waiting

[01:07:21.260 --> 01:07:27.260]
A hacker has gained access to as many as 2.2 million visa and mastercard accounts the two companies announced yesterday

[01:07:27.260 --> 01:07:32.420]
The hacker breached the security system of a company that processes credit card transactions on behalf of merchants

[01:07:32.420 --> 01:07:34.500]
Visa and mastercard be saying

[01:07:35.020 --> 01:07:41.480]
None of the visa accounts has been used fraudulently visa spokesman John Abrams said the affected accounts make up about a third of one percent of the

[01:07:41.480 --> 01:07:47.880]
560 million mastercard visa cards in the US spokesman for the two companies said they've notified the banks that issued the affected cards

[01:07:49.320 --> 01:07:55.660]
Both card companies have zero liability policies which protect card was from being held responsible for an authorized or fraudulent charges

[01:07:55.660 --> 01:07:58.300]
The audio now let me ask you what happens for example

[01:07:59.660 --> 01:08:03.320]
Somebody steals your credit card right like those gypsy still my credit cards enroll many years ago

[01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:09.500]
Right and they go and they make a bunch of fraudulent charges they get the merchandise from the stores. What happens to the merchants?

[01:08:10.860 --> 01:08:14.080]
What happens to the merchants right because they're not going to get paid?

[01:08:15.340 --> 01:08:17.720]
I guess they're screwed you think

[01:08:19.660 --> 01:08:25.760]
Yeah, no there must be something they must have some kind of insurance whether agreement with the American Express or visa mastercard

[01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:29.400]
There must be some kind of way than they get covered just like the card holder gets covered

[01:08:31.160 --> 01:08:35.400]
I really don't know maybe maybe some astute listener out there will know just something to think about okay

[01:08:36.280 --> 01:08:40.500]
Also, we got healthy ice cream question mark. I don't know if I want to talk about that. Just read about it on our website

[01:08:40.500 --> 01:08:41.880]
Okay, I don't want to talk about ice cream

[01:08:43.020 --> 01:08:47.100]
You'll be pleased to know that I haven't even thought about ice cream although I did discover it. I don't want to talk about it

[01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:55.680]
No, my blood sugar is excellent. I'm coming along very nicely. Thank you. I blood pressure is outstanding

[01:08:56.440 --> 01:08:58.720]
But I discovered something called almond brittle

[01:08:59.240 --> 01:09:02.460]
You know how they have all this great candy up here that you don't find in the States correct

[01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:08.760]
During the next break, I'm going to go into wastebask in the other room and just take the package out so I can tell you who makes it

Jacko child sex scandal said to explode reports this week's inquirer

[01:16:20.220 --> 01:16:29.240]
Have you read this? No the Michael Jackson child molestation investigation could explode spectacularly into the open once again

[01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:34.180]
As a brand new witness who stayed with Michael at his neverland ranch considers telling all

[01:16:34.760 --> 01:16:36.800]
The inquirer has learned exclusively

[01:16:38.040 --> 01:16:43.580]
Nearly 10 years ago the singer's world caved in when a 13 year old boy accused the entertainer sexually abusing him

[01:16:43.580 --> 01:16:47.340]
But the youngster did not testify against jacks new bodice silence for a staggering

[01:16:47.920 --> 01:16:52.780]
40 million dollars the inquirer is withholding his name 40 million. You know what was that much?

[01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:58.380]
I knew it was 30 something I didn't know it 40 million says the inquirer and the inquirer don't lie

[01:16:58.380 --> 01:17:02.640]
Now the sensational scandal which jacks and the head hope was doused could reignite

[01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:08.240]
Santa Barbara County Sheriff deputies were aware of these second youngster back in 94 disclosed insider

[01:17:08.240 --> 01:17:10.720]
They talked with him and even had him in a safe house

[01:17:10.720 --> 01:17:14.320]
But neither he nor the boy who brought the initial allegations made it to a grand jury

[01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:19.080]
Because the first boy's family was paid off this boy and his family decided to back out

[01:17:19.080 --> 01:17:21.060]
They didn't want to be the only ones taking on Michael

[01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:25.240]
They were definitely fearful of what it might do to their lives especially to boys life

[01:17:25.240 --> 01:17:29.920]
So they try to keep his involvement a secret and for the most part of the state a secret until now

[01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:39.660]
But the past is being dredged up again in the boy now a young man is considering what to do the recent ABC special on Michael's odd life and a natural obsession with children

[01:17:39.660 --> 01:17:45.300]
Has stirred up allegations that Jackson hope that this appeared but now is most frightening nightmares threatened to turn real

[01:17:46.260 --> 01:17:52.380]
Robert Wagner reformer Beverly Hills Policeman employed his chief of security neverland ranch for three years has written a book that will

[01:17:52.380 --> 01:17:55.940]
Rekindle questions about Jackson's sleepovers with young children

[01:17:57.060 --> 01:18:00.640]
Wagner said he counted up to 150 youngsters who slept with Jackson between

[01:18:00.640 --> 01:18:07.560]
1990 and 1993 he also said he was troubled by Jackson's habit of inviting favored children to a viewing booth in his private cinema

[01:18:07.560 --> 01:18:11.340]
Where he says there was a bed and chair and then closing the curtains around them

[01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:14.420]
What movies do you think they were watching in there George?

[01:18:15.800 --> 01:18:22.020]
Erotic Santa Barbara District attorney Thomas Sneedon says the Jackson case from a decade or remains open but inactive

[01:18:23.920 --> 01:18:27.780]
Now I'm not gonna read your book. Huh nothing it's my imagination

[01:18:29.340 --> 01:18:33.580]
Inquirer files trip up Jackson's claims at the bottom they got like a little uh in set

[01:18:34.280 --> 01:18:39.400]
With a few examples of the B.S. He was talking about that special which you'll notice he had to have his own special to be but it

[01:18:39.400 --> 01:18:40.580]
No, no, it's about it

[01:18:40.580 --> 01:18:45.620]
The inquirer caught the king of pop telling a number of bald face lies in the course of his TV special

[01:18:45.620 --> 01:18:49.180]
Here are some of his claims coveted by the information from our files

[01:18:49.780 --> 01:18:55.820]
Plastic surgery Jackson he claims he's had only two operations both on his nose the inquirer

[01:18:55.820 --> 01:18:58.160]
Jackson has head up to eight operations on his nose

[01:18:58.160 --> 01:19:03.960]
The vision he's had is jaw squared as eyebrows raised a club foot in his chin and since 1983 is progressively lighten his

[01:19:03.960 --> 01:19:04.760]
Completion

[01:19:04.760 --> 01:19:06.280]
Sleeping with children

[01:19:06.760 --> 01:19:10.860]
Jackson he claims it's not sexual. We were going to sleep. I tucked them in it's very charming

[01:19:11.660 --> 01:19:18.680]
Inquirer in the 1993 molestation investigation of Jackson the 13-year-old victim said he had sexual contact with me on many occasions

[01:19:18.680 --> 01:19:20.040]
He kissed me on the lips

[01:19:20.040 --> 01:19:23.460]
Gradually by the buttocks and put his tongue in my mouth. I told him I didn't like that

[01:19:23.460 --> 01:19:25.500]
But he said there was nothing wrong. He said

[01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.060]
Cancer boy Gavin Jackson

[01:19:29.660 --> 01:19:34.060]
He uh Jackson held hands with 12-year-old Gavin during the interview and admitted they sleep to get in the same rooms

[01:19:34.060 --> 01:19:38.240]
Flames he has permission from the boys family the inquirer Gavin's father

[01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:43.160]
David Arvisa was outraged that the boys mother was lost into sleeping Jackson's bed and said it's obvious

[01:19:43.160 --> 01:19:47.660]
Gavin shouldn't be up on Jackson's ranch unsupervised but his mother doesn't care

[01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:53.540]
And parenthood Jackson claims he's a good parent for the inquirer top child care experts were stunned

[01:19:53.540 --> 01:19:56.980]
At the way Jackson treated his children during the tipping of the TV special

[01:19:56.980 --> 01:20:00.720]
Shakeily feeding his baby through a veil and making the older ones wear masks

[01:20:00.720 --> 01:20:06.700]
New Jersey psychologists Dr. Patricia Ferrell said Jackson is contributing to serious mental health problems for these kids in the future

[01:20:06.700 --> 01:20:09.380]
The father of the year Michael Michael

[01:20:10.700 --> 01:20:11.940]
Motorcycle how do you like that?

[01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:15.800]
That's just a little piece of intercourse the globe and the star each have their own take

[01:20:16.480 --> 01:20:20.640]
Which we'll get to just briefly little tidbits here near because people do care

[01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:24.400]
They do want to know right as much as we hate to admit it and you want to know why like I said before

[01:20:25.660 --> 01:20:27.120]
Why because it's something different

[01:20:27.640 --> 01:20:31.580]
I mean it's something old but it's something old. It's been brought back and it's not sawed him

[01:20:31.580 --> 01:20:36.180]
And it's not a rack and it's not the bushmeister and it's not all these depressing grotesque it's not the orange alert

[01:20:36.180 --> 01:20:38.960]
It's not Tom Raid. It's not cheesehead Tommy Thompson

[01:20:40.040 --> 01:20:41.760]
See what I'm saying what's OJ up to

[01:20:42.300 --> 01:20:45.640]
It's not OJ any all the way if he would want to go and kill somebody this week

[01:20:45.640 --> 01:20:49.840]
I'm sure they'd love to hear about that too. Oh, can you imagine what a public service he'd be doing

[01:20:49.840 --> 01:20:55.560]
I mean nobody important though. Jay nobody deserves to be alive. You know find some scumbag kill some people

[01:20:55.560 --> 01:20:56.560]
There you go

[01:20:56.560 --> 01:20:59.780]
The sailor who fell from grace with the sea

[01:20:59.780 --> 01:21:03.680]
They say that on there. I saw it. Whatever. You know, we're not gonna argue with them

[01:21:04.300 --> 01:21:08.260]
Well, I mean doesn't have any pie it says with with Chris Christopher's and Sarah Miles

[01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.900]

You know what Chris Christopher's and looks like. Yes. All right. Shave his beard. They're Sarah Miles. I see

[01:21:20.040 --> 01:21:24.740]
Offbeat moody romantic melodrama about the effect of wintered women's affair on some critics were mixed

[01:21:24.740 --> 01:21:27.240]
Erotic love scenes idiosyncratic

[01:21:28.120 --> 01:21:28.640]
script

[01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:33.700]
Seacost landscape appeals to fans of non-mainstream love stories. I already wrote it down

[01:21:33.700 --> 01:21:38.280]
And did you know what I'm gonna say her who yeah, I won't get a vote. It's too long to write it down

[01:21:38.280 --> 01:21:41.580]
The sailor who fell from grace with the sea

[01:21:41.580 --> 01:21:42.680]
Oh, what is that?

[01:21:43.080 --> 01:21:50.040]
A sliver with Sharon Stone where she spreads her legs that was basic instinct where she uh spreads her legs

[01:21:50.040 --> 01:21:53.600]
But nevertheless don't confuse them. Well, what about sliver? I don't know about sliver. Yes

[01:21:53.600 --> 01:21:56.840]
Did he like another like spread another was a shower scene

[01:21:57.260 --> 01:22:01.220]
Those cameras there was a shower scene and seen in psycho, too, but it wasn't an erotic movie

[01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:02.520]
neurotic

[01:22:04.060 --> 01:22:04.780]
Corriguer carcola

[01:22:04.780 --> 01:22:07.620]
Some is got color you learn here, which we already got it. No, it was x-rated

[01:22:07.620 --> 01:22:15.140]
And a little humor and as deliverance Ned Vady puts on the Academy Award winning performance right as he takes it back to him

[01:22:15.780 --> 01:22:17.880]
Uh video drum, which was on a poor yesterday

[01:22:17.880 --> 01:22:22.380]
It says was an 80s movie where a woman was having sex with a demon that was in her home

[01:22:22.380 --> 01:22:25.880]
I was still scraping off the sponge on my ceiling from watching that one and you say

[01:22:26.580 --> 01:22:27.260]
That whatever

[01:22:28.680 --> 01:22:32.120]
But what kind of an answer is that I'm sitting here with my pen poised

[01:22:32.920 --> 01:22:35.100]
Waiting for a decision. I like that. It was a good movie

[01:22:35.100 --> 01:22:40.220]
I know I didn't consider it erotic. I mean in spite of Debbie Harry who didn't show us anything in that was she Harry?

[01:22:40.680 --> 01:22:41.040]
No

[01:22:41.800 --> 01:22:44.480]
She was dressed that's what America wants to know was Debbie Harry

[01:22:45.320 --> 01:22:48.060]
So we still haven't got the name of that movie that the guy was just dying

[01:22:48.060 --> 01:22:51.100]
Uh, but he got it off the fact as a matter of fact. I think what was it?

[01:22:51.180 --> 01:22:56.340]
Somebody says that it's called exotic gun the chick wears a schoolgirl outfit and the customer becomes obsessed with her very hot

[01:22:56.340 --> 01:23:00.320]
All right, uh for Mark who sent another facts and uh

[01:23:00.320 --> 01:23:01.700]
Mark has good taste

[01:23:02.440 --> 01:23:04.920]
Because he made a suggestion on the previous facts that I just sent you

[01:23:06.200 --> 01:23:09.280]
The only facts that I got you just sent me is the new copy for dial amateurs

[01:23:09.860 --> 01:23:10.860]
That didn't come from me

[01:23:11.420 --> 01:23:15.500]
Well must come from fat boy and since we already ran run spot you better get with it mister

[01:23:15.500 --> 01:23:18.780]
Okay fat boy you fat tub. That's why it's a little bit slow

[01:23:19.400 --> 01:23:25.500]
Because in case you haven't noticed us fat people move real slow and in his case they want or real slow like to his

[01:23:25.500 --> 01:23:26.140]
fax machine

[01:23:26.880 --> 01:23:28.580]
But better late than ever fat boy

[01:23:28.960 --> 01:23:33.920]
20 to 11 at 560 WQM Joe Rose for the mad dog at one the hump are three this afternoon

[01:23:33.920 --> 01:23:39.040]
Hey, I'll tell you a place where you can go and really pick out or you can go get a shout out if you like maybe an anti-poto

[01:23:39.700 --> 01:23:41.480]
Boris Karloff always like an anti-poto

[01:23:42.520 --> 01:23:45.200]
Why do they always say that when people imitate Boris Karloff

[01:23:46.180 --> 01:23:46.900]
Anti-poto

[01:23:46.900 --> 01:23:49.620]

[01:24:08.520 --> 01:24:11.080]
That's why they make so much pizza because he's got so much dough

[01:24:11.080 --> 01:24:15.140]
You want to know why because it's consistently outstanding and everybody pays a paupery price

[01:24:15.140 --> 01:24:18.720]
Even the rimmers pay for a little eat at the pizza lot you might pay a little bit more

[01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:23.520]
But it'll be well worth the price you'll find the original Broward pizza lot on university dry right between

[01:24:23.520 --> 01:24:27.500]
Griffin and 595 behind pair one imports with acres of free parking for you

And the food like I said is fresh. It's delicious. The prices are incredibly embarrassingly low

[01:24:31.960 --> 01:24:36.040]

You know what's how Gilbert fit right in there so this period is so pretty.

[01:28:01.820 --> 01:28:04.900]
I just checked Gilbert and Eric is the answer is still no.

[01:28:05.200 --> 01:28:07.020]
1047 at 560 WQA.

[01:28:07.160 --> 01:28:11.400]
Our audience right on top of it, a merchant is responsible for the charges that result from a stolen card.

[01:28:11.880 --> 01:28:16.340]
It's the responsibility of the merchant to establish proof the card does in fact belong to the card holder, the buyer.

[01:28:16.820 --> 01:28:18.860]
I take credit cards over the internet which is a high risk.

[01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:21.440]
I get about four chargebacks per month stolen card.

[01:28:21.700 --> 01:28:22.460]
Thank you very much.

[01:28:24.220 --> 01:28:25.220]
And here's another one.

[01:28:25.660 --> 01:28:28.840]
There are different rules pertaining to liability responsibilities for credit card usage.

[01:28:28.840 --> 01:28:38.560]
If the merchant is an internet or mail order telephone or to merchant, there are no effective ways they can authenticate the identity of the consumer making the purchase, nor is there usually a signature to go with a purchase.

[01:28:39.320 --> 01:28:44.980]
When there's a fraudulent transaction that takes place, the merchant is liable for the transaction and any penalties associated with the transaction.

[01:28:45.640 --> 01:28:55.240]
In the physical world as usually a signature associated with the transaction, even if the transactions are fraudulent when the card holder is responsible for 50 bucks that a transaction amount, while the issue is responsible for the rest.

[01:28:56.020 --> 01:28:58.060]
In most cases, the issue or waves the $50.

[01:28:58.360 --> 01:28:59.920]
Thank you very much Mike.

[01:29:01.600 --> 01:29:03.880]
Carlos with the K and Eric Carlos with the K from yesterday.

[01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:04.460]
Yes.

[01:29:04.820 --> 01:29:06.240]
Rhymes with say.

[01:29:07.300 --> 01:29:09.520]
He says how about cruel intentions one and two.

[01:29:12.360 --> 01:29:14.200]
I wrote him down already, but whatever.

[01:29:14.720 --> 01:29:17.680]
Well, if you're going to write these down, don't I mean let me know about it.

[01:29:18.360 --> 01:29:21.780]
I'm just staying ahead of the game so that I can give them to Carlos so that we don't fall behind.

[01:29:22.760 --> 01:29:24.900]
I see cruel intentions one and one and two.

[01:29:25.100 --> 01:29:26.140]
I mean you're just cruel intentions.

[01:29:26.600 --> 01:29:28.380]
There was a hot kiss in one of them.

[01:29:28.600 --> 01:29:29.340]
Mom just put me up.

[01:29:30.140 --> 01:29:31.880]
Now here's the fact it's very important.

[01:29:31.980 --> 01:29:39.140]
It goes to show that even though we have two computer aces here, computer nerds, that we still need the audience to be monitoring them at all times very carefully.

[01:29:39.140 --> 01:29:41.500]
Because we're not perfect, even Eric's not perfect.

[01:29:41.860 --> 01:29:46.100]
I went to your site to vote for the summer of 42 and it appears that Eric as an error.

[01:29:46.920 --> 01:29:51.340]
Eric has listed summer lovers twice and left out summer 42 wanted to let you know.

[01:29:51.480 --> 01:29:52.820]
Thank you very, very much again.

[01:29:53.200 --> 01:29:54.800]
Now let me just monitor this.

[01:29:54.920 --> 01:29:56.380]
Okay, we're monitoring you, Eric.

[01:29:56.920 --> 01:29:59.720]
I'm looking, I think they're from the summer of 42 with five votes.

[01:30:00.100 --> 01:30:01.200]
I see summer lovers only once.

[01:30:02.560 --> 01:30:06.920]
So like I said, I retract my thank you, Betty, Betty, much and whatever.

[01:30:06.920 --> 01:30:08.700]
Maybe they just couldn't find it, you know.

[01:30:09.040 --> 01:30:10.640]
I'm looking at summer 42 right now.

[01:30:10.660 --> 01:30:11.540]
It's got five votes.

[01:30:12.520 --> 01:30:13.420]
Didn't get mine.

[01:30:14.020 --> 01:30:16.320]
Whatever happened to Greg Grimes, he just disappeared, huh?

[01:30:17.420 --> 01:30:17.980]
I guess I don't know.

[01:30:20.320 --> 01:30:21.320]
He just disappeared.

[01:30:22.380 --> 01:30:23.100]
What a shame.

[01:30:23.420 --> 01:30:27.040]
Pretty baby says a P to P to P to P to P to file.

[01:30:27.220 --> 01:30:27.760]
I wrote that.

[01:30:28.380 --> 01:30:29.040]
Oh, I see.

[01:30:32.240 --> 01:30:34.820]
Pretty baby, Berkshield is most definitely naked in this one.

[01:30:34.820 --> 01:30:37.960]
She's like a leather and Lolita.

[01:30:38.180 --> 01:30:39.380]
I like the original with Suanne line.

[01:30:39.520 --> 01:30:40.800]
It says that was the one with James Mason.

[01:30:41.320 --> 01:30:42.180]
Let's see a theme.

[01:30:43.140 --> 01:30:44.440]
That was one with James Mason.

[01:30:44.780 --> 01:30:45.240]
Was it?

[01:30:45.920 --> 01:30:46.560]
I believe.

[01:30:46.760 --> 01:30:47.460]
I don't think I ever saw it.

[01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:50.840]
You never saw James Mason and Suanne line in Lolita.

[01:30:51.100 --> 01:30:54.580]
Maybe you never saw Judy Garland and James Mason in the stars born.

[01:30:55.420 --> 01:30:55.900]
You're right.

[01:30:56.020 --> 01:30:56.640]
I didn't.

[01:30:56.660 --> 01:30:59.040]
Oh my god.

[01:30:59.120 --> 01:31:00.420]
And I'm going to tell you there's another.

[01:31:00.700 --> 01:31:02.400]
That would be a good movie for poll two.

[01:31:03.760 --> 01:31:05.580]
Movies that had no business being remade.

[01:31:05.720 --> 01:31:06.760]
Not tell you one right now.

[01:31:06.780 --> 01:31:08.040]
Well speaking of Mo.

[01:31:08.560 --> 01:31:09.140]
Speaking of Mo.

[01:31:09.960 --> 01:31:10.760]
La Cajafol.

[01:31:10.920 --> 01:31:11.920]
What was the name of the Robin Williams?

[01:31:12.300 --> 01:31:13.740]
That's where he got that Faggot owner.

[01:31:13.860 --> 01:31:14.640]
What is the thing is from?

[01:31:14.700 --> 01:31:15.300]
The Bird Cage.

[01:31:15.800 --> 01:31:16.200]
The Burke.

[01:31:16.440 --> 01:31:20.300]
If ever there was a movie that it was a crime to remake.

[01:31:20.780 --> 01:31:21.400]
That was it.

[01:31:21.860 --> 01:31:24.860]
And what was the Hitchcock movie that Faggot remade because some Hitchcock movie?

[01:31:25.220 --> 01:31:27.000]
That everybody said, why did they do that?

[01:31:27.440 --> 01:31:29.140]
Well, they might have been psycho like three times.

[01:31:29.380 --> 01:31:30.100]
It was psycho.

[01:31:30.300 --> 01:31:30.500]
You're right.

[01:31:30.500 --> 01:31:31.460]
It might have been Rear.

[01:31:31.500 --> 01:31:31.860]
Break them.

[01:31:32.020 --> 01:31:32.220]
Window.

[01:31:33.940 --> 01:31:35.320]
How do we call them re-naked that one?

[01:31:35.840 --> 01:31:36.140]
What's that?

[01:31:36.420 --> 01:31:36.840]
Rear window.

[01:31:37.300 --> 01:31:38.340]
No, I was a...

[01:31:38.340 --> 01:31:39.420]
You forget about it.

[01:31:40.580 --> 01:31:41.660]
You weren't with me on that.

[01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:45.800]
I think Roger Vadim's and God created a woman with Rebecca DiMorne was a very central film.

[01:31:46.080 --> 01:31:47.620]
What was the movie she was in that I liked so much?

[01:31:47.920 --> 01:31:49.680]
Where she played the Housekeeper's name?

[01:31:49.820 --> 01:31:50.840]
The Hand that Rocks the Canadian.

[01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:52.700]
I loved that movie a lot.

[01:31:53.500 --> 01:31:54.220]
It was just fine.

[01:31:54.580 --> 01:31:56.200]
It wasn't sexy or erotic or anything.

[01:31:56.200 --> 01:31:57.340]
No, it was just the fine.

[01:31:57.740 --> 01:31:58.760]
It was good.

[01:31:58.760 --> 01:32:00.440]
It was like a scary, you know?

[01:32:01.280 --> 01:32:02.460]
And she played a real bitch.

[01:32:03.440 --> 01:32:05.020]
The Hand that Rocks the Canadian.

[01:32:06.100 --> 01:32:09.320]
Anyway, it says Roger Vadim's and God created a woman with Rebecca DiMorne was central.

[01:32:09.320 --> 01:32:11.500]
Also think Roger Vadim's and God created a woman with a rigid part.

[01:32:11.640 --> 01:32:13.260]
Doe in 1957 was very erotic.

[01:32:13.600 --> 01:32:15.900]
The only similarity between the two was the title and the director.

[01:32:16.480 --> 01:32:16.600]
Huh?

[01:32:17.520 --> 01:32:18.660]
So what do we do about that?

[01:32:19.360 --> 01:32:23.820]
Right down in God created woman and let them fight over what you're talking about.

[01:32:24.240 --> 01:32:25.140]
Yeah, because we can't...

[01:32:25.140 --> 01:32:27.620]
I mean, you know, the list is only limited to 7,000 names.

[01:32:27.620 --> 01:32:31.480]
Because even Eric, we wouldn't want to do that too.

[01:32:31.580 --> 01:32:31.760]
What do we?

[01:32:31.880 --> 01:32:32.960]
Well, don't answer questions.

[01:32:33.820 --> 01:32:35.200]
Here are two from somebody else.

[01:32:35.380 --> 01:32:37.280]
Since sirens, there are two movies with this name.

[01:32:37.420 --> 01:32:39.100]
Another one with two movies with the same name.

[01:32:39.340 --> 01:32:39.520]
Good.

[01:32:39.880 --> 01:32:40.700]
Good choice.

[01:32:41.460 --> 01:32:41.900]
Is it?

[01:32:42.060 --> 01:32:42.300]
Yeah.

[01:32:42.680 --> 01:32:43.520]
Well, let me write it down.

[01:32:43.900 --> 01:32:44.820]
Now, how do we differentiate it?

[01:32:44.820 --> 01:32:45.540]
I want to change by vote.

[01:32:47.160 --> 01:32:49.260]
It says this one has Ellie McPherson,

[01:32:49.500 --> 01:32:49.740]
uh?

[01:32:52.680 --> 01:32:53.480]
Ellie McPherson.

[01:32:56.800 --> 01:32:57.600]
Ellie McPherson,

[01:32:57.600 --> 01:32:59.920]
who's the erotic life in early 1900s,

[01:32:59.920 --> 01:33:00.720]
hundreds of Australia.

[01:33:00.900 --> 01:33:02.020]
In other words, down under.

[01:33:02.160 --> 01:33:05.100]
Portia D'Rossi, who is a lesbian and real life from Ellie McPherson,

[01:33:05.120 --> 01:33:05.760]
she's in there.

[01:33:05.980 --> 01:33:06.420]
All naked.

[01:33:06.720 --> 01:33:08.160]
But, yes, that too.

[01:33:08.180 --> 01:33:11.060]
Then, then, just as we were beginning a little steam,

[01:33:11.260 --> 01:33:11.600]
there are a little momentumances.

[01:33:12.440 --> 01:33:14.380]
It has Hugh Grant and Sam Neilinet,

[01:33:14.600 --> 01:33:16.940]
but fortunately, they're not directly involved in any of the erotic scenes.

[01:33:17.100 --> 01:33:17.820]
Well, thank the Lord.

[01:33:18.060 --> 01:33:18.460]
Thank you.

[01:33:19.140 --> 01:33:21.820]
For the notorious by their absence during any of the nakedness.

[01:33:22.080 --> 01:33:22.880]
Hugh Grant.

[01:33:23.180 --> 01:33:25.560]
What is this story?

[01:33:25.620 --> 01:33:27.040]
He must have naked pictures of Queen Elizabeth.

[01:33:27.040 --> 01:33:29.460]
I could use wall cast in that because he was supposed to be like a really

[01:33:29.460 --> 01:33:30.760]
dorky, middice and...

[01:33:30.760 --> 01:33:31.620]
Err, he's a very interesting person.

[01:33:31.620 --> 01:33:32.100]
And that's him.

[01:33:32.300 --> 01:33:34.180]
Perpet like Louisa and passions, a real dork.

[01:33:35.620 --> 01:33:39.280]
Veldus Jure from 1967 with Catherine De Nueve had her most awesome.

[01:33:39.540 --> 01:33:40.360]
Remember Catherine De Nure?

[01:33:40.540 --> 01:33:40.740]
See.

[01:33:41.860 --> 01:33:43.260]
Over those spots used to do on TV.

[01:33:43.440 --> 01:33:44.360]
They used to run like every 10 minutes.

[01:33:44.600 --> 01:33:45.420]
I'm Catherine De Nure.

[01:33:45.620 --> 01:33:45.940]
Remember that?

[01:33:45.940 --> 01:33:46.640]
No estate louder.

[01:33:46.780 --> 01:33:47.100]
One of those.

[01:33:47.200 --> 01:33:47.840]
Something like that.

[01:33:47.980 --> 01:33:48.560]
Some one of those.

[01:33:48.840 --> 01:33:50.780]
She was also in the hunger with Susan Serendin,

[01:33:50.880 --> 01:33:52.800]
which was taught at least at once.

[01:33:52.800 --> 01:33:55.540]
She plays a surgeon's wife who works in a bordella for kicks.

[01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.340]
She likes her sex rough and degrading.

[01:33:58.520 --> 01:34:00.160]
Very hot for a very arty movie.

[01:34:00.880 --> 01:34:01.520]
Veldus Jure.

[01:34:01.660 --> 01:34:02.160]
You got it down?

[01:34:02.400 --> 01:34:02.540]
Yep.

[01:34:03.080 --> 01:34:04.780]
Well, we got a big list here.

[01:34:05.560 --> 01:34:07.700]
And a lot of homework for you people to be doing over the weekend.

[01:34:07.840 --> 01:34:10.120]
They're going to be out there running tapes like crazy or maybe just stealing.

[01:34:10.440 --> 01:34:11.660]
Getting a few bootlegs from Jury.

[01:34:12.900 --> 01:34:15.380]
What was that movie we were going to get a bootleg copy of and you never did?

[01:34:15.980 --> 01:34:17.120]
I did, but I never watched it.

[01:34:17.380 --> 01:34:17.640]
Eight Mile.

[01:34:18.620 --> 01:34:18.940]
Oh!

[01:34:19.260 --> 01:34:20.140]
Oh my god.

[01:34:20.440 --> 01:34:21.140]
Oh, excuse me.

[01:34:21.140 --> 01:34:22.240]
I wouldn't even watch it for free.

[01:34:22.660 --> 01:34:23.560]
I know my eight Mile.

[01:34:23.660 --> 01:34:25.060]
Okay, I know my eight Mile and telegraph.

[01:34:25.060 --> 01:34:26.560]
I know my eight Mile and telegraph.

[01:34:26.560 --> 01:34:29.440]
Even though I haven't been here in a long time, I know I like to palm of your hand, okay?

[01:34:30.520 --> 01:34:34.620]
And if there's one place I don't want to return to ever, it's Detroit.

[01:34:36.480 --> 01:34:40.800]
Pre-1967, one of the world's great, exciting, vibrant, happening places.

[01:34:41.840 --> 01:34:44.680]
Post-1967, you wouldn't drop a turd in that town.

[01:34:44.800 --> 01:34:48.100]
That's how degrading and disgusting that city is, okay?

[01:34:49.980 --> 01:34:51.080]
How did the poll come in?

[01:34:51.080 --> 01:34:52.040]
I'm glad you asked.

[01:34:52.060 --> 01:34:53.240]
What was the most erotic movie?

[01:34:53.240 --> 01:34:55.080]
Not X-ray, do you've ever seen body heat?

[01:34:55.500 --> 01:34:56.880]
What the hell was body heat?

[01:34:57.760 --> 01:34:58.420]
Because I didn't see it.

[01:34:58.440 --> 01:34:58.640]
I don't know.

[01:34:58.720 --> 01:35:02.660]
Murder mystery, Kathleen Turner and William Hurt have an affair and wind up killing her husband.

[01:35:02.680 --> 01:35:04.440]
I think you said Kathleen Turner wasn't in it.

[01:35:04.900 --> 01:35:05.700]
No, that was not in it.

[01:35:05.780 --> 01:35:06.140]
The other one.

[01:35:07.480 --> 01:35:08.740]
Kathleen Turner is body heat.

[01:35:09.400 --> 01:35:10.400]
Can we get this straightened out?

[01:35:10.500 --> 01:35:12.440]
The postman always wanted to see why his turner.

[01:35:12.600 --> 01:35:18.520]
The one that they said was Kathleen Turner, but it's not a stessical line, but Kathleen Turner at her tiny, but perky titties.

[01:35:18.520 --> 01:35:19.440]
My head is body.

[01:35:19.680 --> 01:35:20.640]
My head is body.

[01:35:20.640 --> 01:35:20.960]
My head is spinning.

[01:35:21.600 --> 01:35:24.500]
Anyway, body heat's got 35, 9.5 weeks, it's got 31.

[01:35:25.320 --> 01:35:28.200]
Blue lagoon, this is only two, really getting a big number.

[01:35:28.980 --> 01:35:30.840]
Way way down to blue lagoon 13.

[01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:32.040]
Of course, that's a long time ago.

[01:35:32.320 --> 01:35:32.740]
Blue lagoon.

[01:35:33.020 --> 01:35:33.180]
Right.

[01:35:34.180 --> 01:35:35.360]
What year would you say that was?

[01:35:35.540 --> 01:35:35.660]
I don't know.

[01:35:35.720 --> 01:35:36.420]
I saw it in the theater though.

[01:35:37.400 --> 01:35:38.100]
70 something?

[01:35:39.120 --> 01:35:39.480]
No.

[01:35:39.880 --> 01:35:41.080]
Well, maybe right around 80.

[01:35:41.720 --> 01:35:42.240]
More or less.

[01:35:42.420 --> 01:35:42.860]
I'll look it up.

[01:35:43.120 --> 01:35:43.760]
I feel like it.

[01:35:43.760 --> 01:35:48.720]
Basic instinct 10, unfaithful 10, and everybody else is like single digits after that.

[01:35:49.080 --> 01:35:49.520]
1980.

[01:35:50.420 --> 01:35:51.420]
What did I just say?

[01:35:51.600 --> 01:35:52.080]
What did I say?

[01:35:53.740 --> 01:35:54.180]
1980.

[01:35:55.040 --> 01:35:55.700]
Here's Miami.

[01:35:55.880 --> 01:35:56.060]
Hello.

[01:35:56.820 --> 01:35:57.380]
How can deal?

[01:35:57.660 --> 01:35:58.440]
That was a lucky guess.

[01:35:58.580 --> 01:35:58.960]
Yes, sir.

[01:35:59.260 --> 01:36:00.120]
Hope you feel and better.

[01:36:00.460 --> 01:36:00.780]
I am.

[01:36:00.860 --> 01:36:01.160]
Thank you.

[01:36:01.460 --> 01:36:01.760]
Okay.

[01:36:01.980 --> 01:36:07.220]
You mentioned Pulp Fetch, the Torrentino made another one, a reservoir dog.

[01:36:08.620 --> 01:36:09.720]
Did you ever see that movie?

[01:36:09.920 --> 01:36:11.220]
That was an erotic movie?

[01:36:11.660 --> 01:36:12.080]
Yeah.

[01:36:12.480 --> 01:36:13.420]
In sorts.

[01:36:14.200 --> 01:36:16.600]
Mr. Green, Mr. Blue, Mr. Red.

[01:36:16.800 --> 01:36:16.800]

[01:36:17.260 --> 01:36:17.400]
Yeah.

[01:36:17.840 --> 01:36:18.980]
Yeah, that's a great movie.

[01:36:19.560 --> 01:36:20.280]
It was erotic?

[01:36:20.800 --> 01:36:21.180]
Sure.

[01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:22.800]
In a sense.

[01:36:23.980 --> 01:36:24.940]
It was great.

[01:36:25.580 --> 01:36:26.000]
Okay.

[01:36:27.280 --> 01:36:27.700]
Okay.

[01:36:28.420 --> 01:36:29.520]
I never heard anything.

[01:36:30.080 --> 01:36:33.400]
You're always telling me I should see that movie, but nobody ever knew that it was on the

[01:36:33.400 --> 01:36:33.640]
phone.

[01:36:33.860 --> 01:36:34.660]
You should see that movie.

[01:36:35.160 --> 01:36:35.720]
Yes, you have.

[01:36:35.780 --> 01:36:36.180]
No, no, no.

[01:36:36.360 --> 01:36:39.400]
You said as soon as I finished with Shinverse List and the other one.

[01:36:39.560 --> 01:36:40.480]
Born on the 4th of July.

[01:36:40.480 --> 01:36:44.000]
No, born on the 4th of July and what's the one that Jason was always trying to get me

[01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:44.260]
watched?

[01:36:45.180 --> 01:36:45.540]
Shocked.

[01:36:45.580 --> 01:36:45.700]
Shocked.

[01:36:45.820 --> 01:36:46.280]
I didn't know it.

[01:36:46.340 --> 01:36:49.260]
As soon as I finished with those three, I should watch or whatever he just said, reservoir

[01:36:49.260 --> 01:36:49.460]
dog.

[01:36:49.600 --> 01:36:51.900]
I never heard you never heard me recommend a Quentin Tarantino movie to you.

[01:36:52.160 --> 01:36:52.460]
Oh.

[01:36:53.480 --> 01:36:55.380]
Excuse me, but it certainly wasn't erotic.

[01:36:56.260 --> 01:36:56.940]
No, no.

[01:36:57.240 --> 01:36:58.460]
It was about a fancy rocker.

[01:36:58.600 --> 01:37:00.360]
He's a crazy person.

[01:37:00.900 --> 01:37:02.100]
Oh, that guy was the crazy guy.

[01:37:02.160 --> 01:37:02.460]
You're right.

[01:37:03.840 --> 01:37:04.960]
You didn't even realize that.

[01:37:05.020 --> 01:37:06.060]
That was the crazy guy.

[01:37:07.120 --> 01:37:08.480]
I knew it was a crazy guy.

[01:37:08.480 --> 01:37:09.400]
560.

[01:37:09.680 --> 01:37:09.680]

[01:37:09.760 --> 01:37:10.380]
0560.

[01:37:10.560 --> 01:37:13.320]
Pound 560 on the AT&T Inforizon Wireless Line.

[01:37:13.420 --> 01:37:15.480]
My, my, and look all.

[01:37:15.820 --> 01:37:16.000]
6.

[01:37:16.120 --> 01:37:16.540]
4.

[01:37:16.660 --> 01:37:16.840]
3.

[01:37:16.960 --> 01:37:17.580]
0560.

[01:37:18.020 --> 01:37:19.720]
Way, way, yeah.

[01:37:20.900 --> 01:37:22.500]
You get a lot of it.

[01:37:23.380 --> 01:37:23.820]
Five.

[01:37:24.440 --> 01:37:27.480]
The Rogers on SportsHole Radio WQA.

[01:37:32.020 --> 01:37:36.600]
I want to tell you the truth about the interview with me.

[01:37:36.600 --> 01:37:38.380]
A lot of it was life.

[01:37:39.060 --> 01:37:41.720]
Not for my own mouth, here it is.

[01:37:42.160 --> 01:37:44.420]
On my magic tree branch.

[01:37:44.840 --> 01:37:46.440]
At Neverland branch.

[01:37:46.780 --> 01:37:49.620]
Oh, I sit and write my songs all day.

[01:37:49.840 --> 01:37:51.940]
And I don't wear my pants.

[01:37:52.740 --> 01:37:54.700]
It can poisely over.

[01:37:55.160 --> 01:37:56.980]
I took them in my bed.

[01:37:57.640 --> 01:37:59.800]
I give them milk and cookies.

[01:38:00.100 --> 01:38:02.360]
So that's not what lawyers said.

[01:38:03.360 --> 01:38:07.500]
My Lord will must fell off from plastic surgery.

[01:38:08.240 --> 01:38:13.140]
And my natural black skin can't be white enough for me.

[01:38:13.580 --> 01:38:18.320]
I prefer water balloons over making love.

[01:38:19.120 --> 01:38:23.880]
I have never touched a breast without wearing my glove.

[01:38:24.380 --> 01:38:26.660]
Making love is messy.

[01:38:27.120 --> 01:38:29.120]
For me, it's unknown, known.

[01:38:29.120 --> 01:38:34.360]
That's why I sent all of my sperm fedics to Debbie Roll.

[01:38:34.800 --> 01:38:37.440]
Ah, Kate Monier attacked me.

[01:38:37.720 --> 01:38:39.720]
She ripped off all my clothes.

[01:38:40.460 --> 01:38:45.180]
I've only had two plastic surgeries on my nose.

[01:38:45.460 --> 01:38:50.360]
Not because it looked bad, but because I couldn't smell.

[01:38:51.080 --> 01:38:55.860]
And if you don't believe me, you can freaking go to hell.

[01:38:55.860 --> 01:38:58.640]
And party with the devil.

[01:38:59.740 --> 01:39:00.900]
Tommy Montola.

[01:39:01.840 --> 01:39:04.240]
Suspects he put my hair on fire.

[01:39:04.440 --> 01:39:06.260]
I drink Coca-Cola.

[01:39:06.600 --> 01:39:07.200]
Come on.

[01:39:07.440 --> 01:39:09.100]
Love 020560 WQ.

[01:39:09.100 --> 01:39:10.280]
I'm happy Tuesday too.

[01:39:10.420 --> 01:39:12.120]
A risky business has very erotic scenes.

[01:39:12.120 --> 01:39:13.760]
Is one of our chronic enough factors.

[01:39:14.620 --> 01:39:15.460]
What do you think?

[01:39:15.760 --> 01:39:17.820]
Well, it does have an erotic theatre.

[01:39:18.140 --> 01:39:18.260]
Three.

[01:39:18.980 --> 01:39:19.940]
Okay, risky business.

[01:39:20.140 --> 01:39:20.620]
Get it on there.

[01:39:21.660 --> 01:39:23.500]
Now, this one I find most amusing.

[01:39:23.500 --> 01:39:25.000]
I guess I know what it'll have for crack.

[01:39:25.220 --> 01:39:26.460]
Porkeys is what it says.

[01:39:27.080 --> 01:39:30.800]
I love the scene where the female gym teacher starts howling like a wolf and a smell of

[01:39:30.800 --> 01:39:31.260]
jockstrap.

[01:39:31.260 --> 01:39:34.320]
She jumps on the other teacher right in the middle of the class, how many orphans?

[01:39:34.480 --> 01:39:36.820]
I was played by Kim Katrol, the famous Kim Katrol.

[01:39:37.140 --> 01:39:37.380]
Yes.

[01:39:38.300 --> 01:39:39.020]
What is it?

[01:39:39.100 --> 01:39:39.660]
Is she having a shower scene?

[01:39:40.020 --> 01:39:41.940]
It's as very sexy, I'm serious.

[01:39:42.520 --> 01:39:43.480]
And you're agreeing with her?

[01:39:44.260 --> 01:39:46.200]
Well, it's a comedy, but that doesn't mean that it can't have sex.

[01:39:46.200 --> 01:39:47.940]
Porkeys, how about American pie?

[01:39:48.140 --> 01:39:50.440]
I'm sure there may be people who find scenes in erotic.

[01:39:50.440 --> 01:39:58.860]
I don't know.

[01:39:58.880 --> 01:39:59.220]
I don't know.

[01:39:59.500 --> 01:40:01.240]
I mean, these are comedy movies.

[01:40:01.440 --> 01:40:05.900]
Didn't have the, you know, because there's like a breast here or a hint of a penis there

[01:40:05.900 --> 01:40:08.200]
or a rectum there.

[01:40:08.540 --> 01:40:10.100]
You know, it doesn't, you know, it's a twitching song.

[01:40:10.980 --> 01:40:13.160]
I guess some of these were getting from the real desparados.

[01:40:13.300 --> 01:40:15.400]
You know, we put it that one up there?

[01:40:15.820 --> 01:40:16.060]
What?

[01:40:16.440 --> 01:40:16.820]
The porkeys?

[01:40:17.160 --> 01:40:17.760]
Of course not.

[01:40:17.880 --> 01:40:18.980]
Why do you think that was erotic?

[01:40:19.460 --> 01:40:20.020]
Hell no.

[01:40:20.380 --> 01:40:20.420]
I don't know.

[01:40:20.420 --> 01:40:20.420]

[01:40:20.420 --> 01:40:20.420]

[01:40:20.420 --> 01:40:20.420]

[01:40:20.420 --> 01:40:20.420]

[01:40:20.420 --> 01:40:20.420]

[01:40:20.420 --> 01:40:20.420]

[01:40:20.420 --> 01:40:20.420]

[01:40:20.420 --> 01:40:20.420]

[01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:22.980]
Chaser was erotic, not erotic.

[01:40:23.920 --> 01:40:27.060]
What was the most erotic movie you've ever seen, not X-rated?

[01:40:27.560 --> 01:40:28.320]
What a list we got.

[01:40:28.580 --> 01:40:31.540]
Blu-la-goon, last hangover in Paris, paradise.

[01:40:34.040 --> 01:40:35.900]
Mulholland, now how's that doing, by the way, paradise?

[01:40:36.240 --> 01:40:39.980]
That was a real cheesy ripoff of Blu-la-goon.

[01:40:40.560 --> 01:40:41.420]
Not doing too good.

[01:40:41.560 --> 01:40:42.000]
I don't look at that.

[01:40:42.120 --> 01:40:42.840]
Where the hell is it?

[01:40:43.320 --> 01:40:44.140]
Got no votes.

[01:40:44.140 --> 01:41:12.780]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

[01:41:15.020 --> 01:41:42.760]
I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I swear I

[01:42:12.740 --> 01:42:19.960]
swear

[01:42:19.960 --> 01:42:24.060]
of vampire wild things, the sailor who fell from grace with a sea.

[01:42:25.440 --> 01:42:26.920]
Was that the grace from passions?

[01:42:27.580 --> 01:42:27.920]
Could have been.

[01:42:28.060 --> 01:42:28.500]
It was a disgrace.

[01:42:29.120 --> 01:42:33.760]
In fact, I wish grace would take her tomato soup cake and fall in the sea with that.

[01:42:34.800 --> 01:42:36.140]
Good passions today, by the way.

[01:42:37.260 --> 01:42:39.660]
As we find Ivy at the bottom of the stairs net wheelchair,

[01:42:40.320 --> 01:42:44.300]
a sliver exotic, a pretty baby, Lolita cruel intentions, and God created woman,

[01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:45.820]
sirens belled his jaw.

[01:42:46.760 --> 01:42:47.780]
What did I leave off?

[01:42:49.120 --> 01:42:50.440]
I don't know, I gave my list to Carlos.

[01:42:51.080 --> 01:42:57.160]
No, but I just left off one and I just told you, oh, uh, frisky business, very good.

[01:42:57.540 --> 01:42:57.960]
That's it.

[01:42:58.380 --> 01:42:59.380]
That's where we are at the moment.

[01:43:00.700 --> 01:43:01.980]
And we got a real battle going.

[01:43:02.020 --> 01:43:03.020]
I'm going to strip you a two way battle.

[01:43:03.020 --> 01:43:03.580]
I don't like that.

[01:43:03.640 --> 01:43:05.900]
I hate that because then they then they did it all around with it.

[01:43:07.300 --> 01:43:09.140]
In fact, yes, either did it all around with it.

[01:43:09.280 --> 01:43:10.100]
It's 40-40 now.

[01:43:10.120 --> 01:43:11.280]
And I don't have recent body heat.

[01:43:11.280 --> 01:43:13.240]
Each have 40 and blue, the moon way back to 15.

[01:43:13.480 --> 01:43:14.460]
So they did learn with it.

[01:43:14.460 --> 01:43:16.020]
And the poll too.

[01:43:17.760 --> 01:43:18.900]
Here's for Lauderdale.

[01:43:19.040 --> 01:43:19.160]
Hello.

[01:43:19.760 --> 01:43:20.460]
How about Andy?

[01:43:20.460 --> 01:43:20.940]
How you doing?

[01:43:21.420 --> 01:43:21.620]
Okay.

[01:43:22.100 --> 01:43:25.840]
How about Mr. Goodbar or American graffiti?

[01:43:27.340 --> 01:43:30.680]
American graffiti was around with Richard Sear.

[01:43:33.020 --> 01:43:34.220]
American jiggle.

[01:43:34.280 --> 01:43:34.740]
I'm sorry.

[01:43:35.220 --> 01:43:36.600]
Oh, American jiggle.

[01:43:36.720 --> 01:43:39.820]
American graffiti was a like a Ronnie Howard movie.

[01:43:40.060 --> 01:43:41.760]
Yeah, like Happy Days Part 2.

[01:43:42.460 --> 01:43:43.360]
American jiggle.

[01:43:43.360 --> 01:43:43.440]
Hello.

[01:43:44.200 --> 01:43:46.160]
American jiggle was up with Richard Gear.

[01:43:46.440 --> 01:43:47.900]
Oh, with Richard Gear.

[01:43:48.200 --> 01:43:48.360]
Good.

[01:43:48.720 --> 01:43:49.000]
God.

[01:43:49.440 --> 01:43:50.100]
Richard Sear.

[01:43:50.720 --> 01:43:51.640]
Okay, let's put it down.

[01:43:51.740 --> 01:43:52.500]
Richard, just think through.

[01:43:52.560 --> 01:43:53.080]
Yeah, we got it.

[01:43:53.760 --> 01:43:57.180]
What about, you know, the credit card thing I want to kind of talk to you about.

[01:43:57.780 --> 01:44:03.580]
The deal is that if you have the credit card in your hand and you swipe it through the machine,

[01:44:03.900 --> 01:44:07.320]
if you have a merchant, you're not responsible for that money.

[01:44:07.600 --> 01:44:13.340]
It's only if you take a credit card over the phone or over the internet is when the merchant

[01:44:13.340 --> 01:44:14.440]
is responsible for it.

[01:44:14.480 --> 01:44:18.000]
So, so much skills are credit card and good somewhere and, you know, hands it to someone.

[01:44:18.180 --> 01:44:21.080]
They can charge wherever they want and the merchant is not responsible for it.

[01:44:21.100 --> 01:44:25.560]
The credit card company still pays them the money because it's not their response to the money.

[01:44:25.660 --> 01:44:27.600]
That's not what those two factors said.

[01:44:28.220 --> 01:44:28.760]
Yeah, it did.

[01:44:28.880 --> 01:44:34.220]
If you actually read it, it just basically says that, you know, if it's done over the internet without a signature,

[01:44:34.900 --> 01:44:37.440]
that the merchant is responsible.

[01:44:37.800 --> 01:44:42.140]
It's like when you call in for a hotel reservation and they say, give me your credit card number.

[01:44:42.140 --> 01:44:48.220]
And if you're on the charge, if you cancel, they really can't charge your card because they never actually had the card holder,

[01:44:48.860 --> 01:44:52.380]
you know, they're swiping the card in the machine.

[01:44:52.540 --> 01:44:55.800]
That's why when you get to the hotel, they always ask you for the imprint of the card.

[01:44:56.740 --> 01:44:56.980]
Right.

[01:44:57.500 --> 01:44:58.340]
Do you understand what I mean?

[01:44:58.760 --> 01:44:59.000]
Yeah.

[01:44:59.500 --> 01:45:00.620]
It's just pretty simple.

[01:45:00.820 --> 01:45:03.480]
If you have the credit card in your hand, you swipe it through the machine.

[01:45:04.080 --> 01:45:08.360]
You're not responsible for it, but if it's taken over the phone, that's another thing.

[01:45:08.540 --> 01:45:10.580]
I mean, you know, you have to pay for that.

[01:45:10.580 --> 01:45:11.940]
Okay. Thanks a lot.

[01:45:12.020 --> 01:45:12.580]
All right, bye.

[01:45:12.860 --> 01:45:16.180]
I think, I think, don't you think I should say thanks a lot because now I have no idea what we're talking about.

[01:45:16.380 --> 01:45:16.540]
Right.

[01:45:16.920 --> 01:45:21.020]
What? I thought we headed down Pat with those other two factors that agreed and he said, I think the opposite.

[01:45:21.100 --> 01:45:23.220]
Isn't what he said in the opposite of what the facts have said, I believe.

[01:45:23.660 --> 01:45:24.280]
I'm confused.

[01:45:24.920 --> 01:45:27.280]
So we got American Jiglo with Richard Gears.

[01:45:27.480 --> 01:45:28.760]
Yeah, I don't, I don't understand that.

[01:45:28.900 --> 01:45:32.320]
How can any movie that Richard Geer be in unless, of course, now who else was in that?

[01:45:32.540 --> 01:45:32.980]
Sharon Stone.

[01:45:33.220 --> 01:45:34.500]
I don't, I never saw American Jiglo.

[01:45:35.080 --> 01:45:35.580]
Come on.

[01:45:35.700 --> 01:45:36.420]
Now, look it up, Carl.

[01:45:36.560 --> 01:45:37.080]
I should look at him.

[01:45:38.780 --> 01:45:44.480]
The only problem I have beside the fact is bookway, 6,000 pounds is the fact that the print is so tiny.

[01:45:46.400 --> 01:45:49.380]
This is, this, this is what tells me whether I'm still liable or not.

[01:45:49.460 --> 01:45:52.140]
The fact that I can still read the print in this book without your magnavisions.

[01:45:52.820 --> 01:45:54.180]
Law and Hutton.

[01:45:54.540 --> 01:45:55.360]
American graffiti.

[01:45:57.760 --> 01:45:59.480]
Richard, drive, oh, I'm looking at a movie.

[01:45:59.500 --> 01:46:00.160]
Give it up, you.

[01:46:00.720 --> 01:46:03.640]
American Jiglo, when you calm down, look at so hysterical.

[01:46:03.940 --> 01:46:12.200]
Richard Geer, Law and Hutton, Hector Eliano, Elisando, Nina Van Palant, Bill Duke and Brian Davies.

[01:46:12.320 --> 01:46:13.400]
Well, who the hell is Law and Hutton?

[01:46:13.480 --> 01:46:14.160]
We know who that is.

[01:46:14.280 --> 01:46:14.600]
Who is she?

[01:46:15.180 --> 01:46:17.620]
She is an actress, a model and an actress.

[01:46:18.760 --> 01:46:20.100]
Yeah, and, and old.

[01:46:20.880 --> 01:46:21.120]
Old?

[01:46:21.800 --> 01:46:25.460]
Well, the movie is like I could open up the book again, see what you're, was it's an old freaking movie?

[01:46:25.700 --> 01:46:26.880]
Put it down, okay, American Jiglo.

[01:46:27.080 --> 01:46:28.140]
I would give that guy a shot.

[01:46:28.420 --> 01:46:29.020]
Give him a little shot.

[01:46:29.020 --> 01:46:30.220]
I'm not arguing with any of these people.

[01:46:31.180 --> 01:46:34.920]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 6, 8, we're going to have a gigantic pool here today, folks.

[01:46:35.240 --> 01:46:37.800]
And everybody's invited to hop right on our pool.

[01:46:38.420 --> 01:46:39.700]
Just a piss off that, uh,

[01:46:41.600 --> 01:46:43.920]
Conferring guy, that schmuck, that Jackass.

[01:46:46.060 --> 01:46:47.240]
Here's for a Lutterdale, hello.

[01:46:47.860 --> 01:46:48.460]
Hey, Nail.

[01:46:48.840 --> 01:46:49.320]
Yes, sir.

[01:46:49.760 --> 01:46:50.840]
I got a couple for you.

[01:46:51.400 --> 01:46:55.460]
Okay, one is sort of like Mr. Geer movie, the guy in the movie, that great,

[01:46:55.460 --> 01:46:58.860]
It's really hell said but in there people were like

[01:46:58.860 --> 01:47:03.480]
with a lot of hot scenes in that movie with all those girls that you know

[01:47:03.480 --> 01:47:05.840]
but that hospital publication in there.

[01:47:06.360 --> 01:47:06.640]
Okay.

[01:47:07.120 --> 01:47:09.900]
And the second is for all the brothers out there,

[01:47:10.340 --> 01:47:10.840]
Jungle Fever.

[01:47:11.500 --> 01:47:13.680]
I mean there's some pretty hot scenes in there you know.

[01:47:15.280 --> 01:47:16.300]
Jungle Fever?

[01:47:16.860 --> 01:47:21.080]
Yeah, you know, Westwich nights and NFL and I fell asleep

[01:47:21.080 --> 01:47:22.560]
like an influencer laughing.

[01:47:22.640 --> 01:47:22.800]
Sure.

[01:47:23.440 --> 01:47:24.080]
All right.

[01:47:24.240 --> 01:47:24.360]
Yeah.

[01:47:24.900 --> 01:47:25.740]
Should I wait?

[01:47:27.100 --> 01:47:27.500]
Yeah.

[01:47:27.820 --> 01:47:30.940]
It should a lot of scenes where it's been a hundred and a gather of beds and all that.

[01:47:31.200 --> 01:47:34.500]
It's like a the first white beef that ever came out on TV.

[01:47:35.380 --> 01:47:37.320]
A lot of hot, excuse and scenes in that thing.

[01:47:37.920 --> 01:47:38.180]
Okay.

[01:47:38.220 --> 01:47:38.840]
Thanks a lot, pal.

[01:47:39.500 --> 01:47:42.800]
We got you now people versus Larry Flint and Jungle Fever and whatever.

[01:47:43.640 --> 01:47:46.580]
Here's an article by Ariana Huffington about once every five years to

[01:47:46.580 --> 01:47:49.180]
something that makes sense and the rest of the time is the raping right-wing lunatic.

[01:47:50.760 --> 01:47:51.860]
What is this?

[01:47:52.620 --> 01:47:55.340]
Well, this fact is dodo dodo this goes out to Moe.

[01:47:55.420 --> 01:47:56.540]
How about the crying game?

[01:47:58.520 --> 01:47:59.300]
How about it?

[01:47:59.540 --> 01:48:00.260]
I never saw it.

[01:48:00.460 --> 01:48:02.460]
I understand it's got baggery and cross-dressing.

[01:48:02.640 --> 01:48:03.120]
That's all I know.

[01:48:03.680 --> 01:48:06.240]
Well, in that case, the crying game.

[01:48:06.440 --> 01:48:06.600]
All right.

[01:48:06.980 --> 01:48:08.820]
Get it on that list immediately if not sooner.

[01:48:09.280 --> 01:48:09.980]
How about bully?

[01:48:10.740 --> 01:48:10.880]
Yes.

[01:48:11.740 --> 01:48:12.020]
Boe?

[01:48:13.380 --> 01:48:15.360]
You'd not be like it with bully.

[01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:16.080]
What?

[01:48:16.760 --> 01:48:18.460]
Great for a lot of reasons.

[01:48:20.020 --> 01:48:20.820]
I don't know.

[01:48:21.260 --> 01:48:22.340]
Is that bully bully?

[01:48:22.960 --> 01:48:23.920]
Yeah, it was a little bit.

[01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:24.800]
Well, he's not a fact.

[01:48:25.240 --> 01:48:25.980]
Here's Ethanus.

[01:48:26.060 --> 01:48:27.380]
And not sure if anybody mentioned this one.

[01:48:27.440 --> 01:48:28.280]
It's called bound.

[01:48:28.440 --> 01:48:29.620]
We got well bully now, right?

[01:48:30.140 --> 01:48:33.960]
Bound starring Jennifer Tilly as a mob boss's wife and Gina Gershawna as their lesbian

[01:48:33.960 --> 01:48:34.720]
next door neighbor.

[01:48:34.960 --> 01:48:35.160]
Yeah.

[01:48:35.400 --> 01:48:37.160]
They phone love playing a killer mob husband.

[01:48:37.240 --> 01:48:38.140]
Great lesbian scenes.

[01:48:38.140 --> 01:48:41.340]
This is the first film directed by the Wachowski brothers directors of the Matrix.

[01:48:42.520 --> 01:48:42.920]
Bound.

[01:48:43.160 --> 01:48:43.460]
Got it?

[01:48:43.640 --> 01:48:43.900]
Bound?

[01:48:44.420 --> 01:48:45.360]
Bolly and Bound.

[01:48:45.560 --> 01:48:46.520]
I think we're following.

[01:48:46.660 --> 01:48:47.500]
We're getting to a theme here.

[01:48:47.700 --> 01:48:49.440]
And the lesbian scenes could have been hotter, but nevertheless.

[01:48:50.120 --> 01:48:50.720]
I see.

[01:48:51.340 --> 01:48:51.880]
I see.

[01:48:51.960 --> 01:48:52.540]
This is a book.

[01:48:52.800 --> 01:48:53.780]
Have you read this book, Ariane?

[01:48:53.820 --> 01:48:55.380]
Having them pigs at the trough?

[01:48:55.700 --> 01:48:59.920]
How corporate greed and political corruption around the mining market might be good because every now and

[01:48:59.920 --> 01:49:03.560]
end like I said, she does something lucid and makes a little bit of sense.

[01:49:03.560 --> 01:49:06.820]
And then the rest of the time she goes and reverts to her origins again.

[01:49:07.620 --> 01:49:11.640]
Like that crazy thing about the, the SUVs and the gas and all of that.

[01:49:11.640 --> 01:49:14.220]
Oh, my goodness.

[01:49:16.220 --> 01:49:18.140]
It just makes you want to sit down and cry.

[01:49:18.400 --> 01:49:19.700]
I mean, where's the logic in that?

[01:49:19.980 --> 01:49:21.800]
We're helping terrorists by buying SUVs.

[01:49:21.980 --> 01:49:25.240]
What difference does it make whether you're getting 10 miles through a gallon or 20 miles

[01:49:25.240 --> 01:49:25.620]
through a gallon?

[01:49:25.620 --> 01:49:26.680]
You're still buying gas.

[01:49:27.080 --> 01:49:30.400]
As a matter of fact, if you're buying any product that was transported here with gas.

[01:49:31.040 --> 01:49:31.220]
Right.

[01:49:32.920 --> 01:49:33.860]
I mean, come on, Ariane.

[01:49:33.960 --> 01:49:35.000]
Get a life, sweetheart.

[01:49:35.660 --> 01:49:37.180]
I understand that you've had some real tough times here.

[01:49:37.200 --> 01:49:39.080]
Husband was a fact, but that's beside the point.

[01:49:39.400 --> 01:49:39.580]
Really?

[01:49:39.580 --> 01:49:40.420]
I didn't know that.

[01:49:41.160 --> 01:49:41.520]
Yeah.

[01:49:41.760 --> 01:49:44.720]
Don't you remember he ran for governor or something in California and then he finally out

[01:49:44.720 --> 01:49:45.860]
and outed in the whole dealer?

[01:49:46.180 --> 01:49:46.360]
Yeah.

[01:49:46.500 --> 01:49:46.860]
No.

[01:49:47.640 --> 01:49:48.340]
Well, he was.

[01:49:48.540 --> 01:49:49.140]
See, you learn something.

[01:49:49.180 --> 01:49:50.260]
It's just barely 11 o'clock.

[01:49:50.320 --> 01:49:50.500]
Right.

[01:49:50.580 --> 01:49:50.860]
It's down.

[01:49:51.180 --> 01:49:53.780]
12 minutes after 11 at 5.60 WQAM.

[01:49:54.580 --> 01:49:55.360]
Showed on Iraq.

[01:49:55.580 --> 01:49:57.140]
There's Nick Robertson over there showing us.

[01:49:57.140 --> 01:49:58.560]
See, we haven't hardly mentioned that all today.

[01:49:59.360 --> 01:50:00.480]
And don't we feel better for it?

[01:50:01.180 --> 01:50:02.620]
I mean, what is there to say anymore?

[01:50:02.760 --> 01:50:04.180]
You know, what is there to say?

[01:50:04.400 --> 01:50:04.560]
Nothing.

[01:50:04.740 --> 01:50:05.820]
Get lots of work going in.

[01:50:06.260 --> 01:50:07.460]
Whatever resolution it takes.

[01:50:07.460 --> 01:50:09.600]
However much arm twisting and pulling it takes.

[01:50:09.940 --> 01:50:14.760]
And we know that Bush has got naked pictures of Tony Blair and Amousse and Prince Charles.

[01:50:14.760 --> 01:50:16.080]
They're all in there together doing it.

[01:50:16.380 --> 01:50:16.960]
They're humping it.

[01:50:17.660 --> 01:50:18.900]
And that's the way it is.

[01:50:19.620 --> 01:50:20.780]
As Walter Crockite would say.

[01:50:21.440 --> 01:50:22.240]
He's still alive, you know?

[01:50:22.660 --> 01:50:22.880]
Yeah.

[01:50:23.820 --> 01:50:24.220]
Barely.

[01:50:24.400 --> 01:50:25.720]
He don't look too good.

[01:50:26.420 --> 01:50:27.460]
13 past 11.

[01:50:27.620 --> 01:50:29.160]
If I always better shape them, David Brinkeley.

[01:50:29.420 --> 01:50:31.680]
Hey, have ever been presented with an opportunity when you should have could have

[01:50:31.680 --> 01:50:32.940]
would have done something but didn't do it.

[01:50:32.940 --> 01:50:34.780]
You couldn't pull the trigger fast enough and get it done.

[01:50:34.780 --> 01:50:37.320]
There is an incredible Fannie Mae mortgage rate out there.

[01:50:37.440 --> 01:50:39.780]
You really ought to consider taking advantage of a 3.45%.

[01:50:40.880 --> 01:50:45.560]
And this rate's available to you by calling financial group at 1-800-94053.

[01:50:46.520 --> 01:50:53.160]
If you were to compare a 7% rate with 3.45%, you'd save yourself 3,500 bucks in the first year alone for each 100,000-U.O.

[01:50:53.720 --> 01:50:56.220]
100,000 bucks cost you only 447 a month.

[01:50:56.520 --> 01:50:58.040]
This is an opportunity that won't last.

[01:50:58.180 --> 01:50:59.220]
It's a 40 year low.

[01:50:59.660 --> 01:51:03.280]
So if you've been thinking about refinancing or buying a home, this is what you ought to do.

[01:51:03.280 --> 01:51:07.340]

[01:51:33.060 --> 01:51:34.160]
You ain't too way.

[01:51:34.600 --> 01:51:36.420]
Hi, this is Jim.

[01:51:37.200 --> 01:51:38.420]
Love your show, Neil.

[01:51:38.980 --> 01:51:39.620]
Love you.

[01:51:40.200 --> 01:51:41.140]
Love you.

[01:51:50.520 --> 01:51:56.180]
His name is Joey's gotta show on Foss pretending he's rich.

[01:51:56.180 --> 01:51:59.520]
But I grew up with Joe so I should know.

[01:51:59.740 --> 01:52:01.180]
I caught him sometimes he pitched.

[01:52:02.140 --> 01:52:03.600]
He gets okay I guess.

[01:52:04.820 --> 01:52:08.040]
Because I wore a dress and thought he was mine.

[01:52:09.120 --> 01:52:16.220]
All that candlelight in life is a handsome guy and that's no lie, but he's the truth I swear it.

[01:52:17.040 --> 01:52:23.720]
I walked in on him and spun down in Jim with a pill jacket and a carrot and he's got smelly feet.

[01:52:23.720 --> 01:52:26.420]
And his hair is full of grease.

[01:52:26.880 --> 01:52:28.200]
And his another treat.

[01:52:29.500 --> 01:52:33.040]
He's got a fetish for G.C. men long to the G.

[01:52:33.480 --> 01:52:35.240]
Why, why did he never did care?

[01:52:36.780 --> 01:52:39.220]
And he was Mrs. Pac-Man underwear.

[01:52:41.120 --> 01:52:43.960]
And he's the only dresses up like Cher.

[01:52:44.920 --> 01:52:47.720]
1118 at 560 W.D. Jim here's a credit card professional.

[01:52:48.640 --> 01:52:50.280]
Some of them might know the real answer to our question.

[01:52:50.400 --> 01:52:50.560]
Hello.

[01:52:51.240 --> 01:52:52.500]
Neil, how are you this morning?

[01:52:52.760 --> 01:52:53.220]
Pretty good sir.

[01:52:53.720 --> 01:52:53.880]
Good.

[01:52:54.560 --> 01:52:57.060]
I was in an appointment didn't hear the original question.

[01:52:57.360 --> 01:53:01.760]
But I heard that gentleman's answer and he was incorrect.

[01:53:02.120 --> 01:53:07.180]
If I could ask you what was the original question you had about the credit card?

[01:53:07.940 --> 01:53:16.480]
The original question was if somebody steals your credit cards and you're not responsible or maybe only responsible for the first 50 bucks, where does that leave the merchant?

[01:53:16.480 --> 01:53:19.120]
In other words, somebody has to pay for the merchandise to be responsible.

[01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:21.460]
Where does the merchant come in?

[01:53:23.060 --> 01:53:31.700]
If someone hands the merchant a stolen credit card and they swipe the card through their machine and the person signs a receipt,

[01:53:32.560 --> 01:53:44.780]
the merchant is stuck on the hook not only for the goods but they will charge back his account for the credit card money if it is advanced to him.

[01:53:44.780 --> 01:53:47.460]
The merchant is the one who is stuck.

[01:53:48.300 --> 01:53:48.320]
Okay.

[01:53:50.500 --> 01:53:52.440]
On your whole circumstances like that.

[01:53:52.880 --> 01:53:53.120]
Okay.

[01:53:53.400 --> 01:53:57.600]
Yeah, I had two facts to sing exactly what you're singing and this guy knows better than the rest of us.

[01:53:57.740 --> 01:53:58.320]
Okay, thanks a lot.

[01:53:58.340 --> 01:53:59.040]
Yeah, you're welcome.

[01:53:59.240 --> 01:54:00.220]
You too.

[01:54:00.620 --> 01:54:01.320]
There you go.

[01:54:01.780 --> 01:54:03.300]
Three out of four can't be wrong, right?

[01:54:04.360 --> 01:54:04.540]
Sure.

[01:54:06.460 --> 01:54:08.420]
This facts though leaves me limp.

[01:54:09.660 --> 01:54:10.300]
Which one?

[01:54:10.660 --> 01:54:13.140]
The one you just fact me, how about poison ivy?

[01:54:13.240 --> 01:54:14.740]
Jew bear more is so hot.

[01:54:15.160 --> 01:54:16.400]
Oh, man.

[01:54:16.540 --> 01:54:17.220]
What's the point of telling?

[01:54:17.460 --> 01:54:18.980]
She's almost as hot as Tom Green.

[01:54:21.500 --> 01:54:22.900]
Jew bear more is hot.

[01:54:24.240 --> 01:54:27.240]
She used to be pure, she got all scared out of here.

[01:54:27.440 --> 01:54:28.000]
Get out of here.

[01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:28.780]
Get out of here.

[01:54:29.120 --> 01:54:30.920]
Stop, stop, stop.

[01:54:32.360 --> 01:54:33.820]
She's not even lukewarm.

[01:54:34.620 --> 01:54:36.300]
Even luke Easter was hotter than her.

[01:54:36.440 --> 01:54:37.400]
Okay, you don't even know who that is.

[01:54:37.400 --> 01:54:37.660]
No.

[01:54:38.020 --> 01:54:39.080]
Anybody remember luke Easter?

[01:54:39.220 --> 01:54:39.360]
No.

[01:54:39.480 --> 01:54:41.000]
Is that Dick Feinberg at Poppett O'Park?

[01:54:42.580 --> 01:54:43.840]
Jew bear more is so hot.

[01:54:43.900 --> 01:54:45.140]
Okay, poison ivy, what do you say?

[01:54:45.380 --> 01:54:46.360]
I already wrote it down.

[01:54:47.320 --> 01:54:49.160]
Just for them, I mean, just a human.

[01:54:49.400 --> 01:54:50.480]
It has a scene.

[01:54:51.440 --> 01:54:52.300]
Does it really you seen it?

[01:54:52.740 --> 01:54:52.840]
Yep.

[01:54:54.580 --> 01:54:58.920]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, be pound 5, 6, be on the 18 and 10 for eyes on wireless line.

[01:54:59.220 --> 01:55:01.940]
Don't let me forget this great article behind the great divide by Paul Krugman,

[01:55:02.040 --> 01:55:02.880]
which I'm going to read right now.

[01:55:03.740 --> 01:55:06.340]
He doesn't forget that article by Paul Krugman?

[01:55:06.340 --> 01:55:07.240]
Yeah, that's the one.

[01:55:07.400 --> 01:55:11.900]
From today's New York Times, it says here's like, are you interrupting again?

[01:55:11.980 --> 01:55:14.600]
No, I think Moe had a real good point about you.

[01:55:15.720 --> 01:55:18.940]
There's been much speculation while Europe and the US are suddenly at such odds.

[01:55:18.940 --> 01:55:20.700]
Is it about culture, about history?

[01:55:21.220 --> 01:55:23.500]
But I haven't seen much discussion of an obvious point.

[01:55:23.640 --> 01:55:26.460]
We have different views partly because we see different news.

[01:55:27.700 --> 01:55:28.540]
Let's back it up.

[01:55:28.640 --> 01:55:31.500]
Many Americans now blame France for the chill and US European relations.

[01:55:31.500 --> 01:55:33.760]
There is even talk of boycotting French products.

[01:55:34.360 --> 01:55:36.320]
But France's attitude is exceptional.

[01:55:36.860 --> 01:55:41.140]
Last Saturday's huge demonstrations confirm polls that show deep distrust of the Bush administration

[01:55:41.140 --> 01:55:44.760]
and skepticism about an Iraq war and all major European nations,

[01:55:45.040 --> 01:55:46.760]
whatever position their governments may take.

[01:55:46.760 --> 01:55:51.020]
In fact, the biggest demonstrations where countries whose governments are supporting the Bush administration,

[01:55:51.540 --> 01:55:53.460]
A.K.A., Italy and Spain.

[01:55:54.900 --> 01:55:59.340]
There were big demonstrations in America too, but distrust of the US overseas has reached such a level,

[01:55:59.440 --> 01:56:03.620]
even among our British allies, that a recent British pull ranked the US as the world's most dangerous

[01:56:03.620 --> 01:56:05.960]
nation way ahead of North Korea and Iraq.

[01:56:06.680 --> 01:56:09.260]
So, to why don't other countries see the world the way we do?

[01:56:09.820 --> 01:56:11.520]
News coverage is a large part of the answer.

[01:56:11.700 --> 01:56:13.580]
Eric Althamon's new book, What Liberal Media,

[01:56:13.940 --> 01:56:15.560]
doesn't stress international comparisons,

[01:56:16.020 --> 01:56:18.560]
but the difference between the news reports of Americans in European Sea

[01:56:18.560 --> 01:56:20.440]
is a stark demonstration of his point.

[01:56:21.340 --> 01:56:23.120]
At least compared with their foreign counterparts,

[01:56:23.440 --> 01:56:26.720]
the liberal US media are strikingly conservative and in this case hawkish.

[01:56:27.620 --> 01:56:29.560]
I'm not mainly talking about the print media.

[01:56:29.660 --> 01:56:32.700]
There are differences, but the major national newspapers in the US and the UK

[01:56:32.700 --> 01:56:35.020]
at least seem to be describing the same reality.

[01:56:35.640 --> 01:56:38.700]
Most people, though, get their news from TV and their differences immense.

[01:56:40.400 --> 01:56:45.080]
The coverage of Saturday's anti-war rally was a reminder of an extent to which the US cable news in particular

[01:56:45.080 --> 01:56:48.920]
seems to be reporting about a different planet than the one covered by foreign media.

[01:56:49.820 --> 01:56:51.800]
What would someone watch in cable news of seen?

[01:56:52.320 --> 01:56:55.640]
On Saturday, news anchors on Fox described that administrators in New York

[01:56:55.640 --> 01:56:58.340]
as the usual protesters or serial protesters.

[01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:01.640]
CNN wasn't quite so dismissive, but on Sunday morning,

[01:57:01.640 --> 01:57:03.500]
the headline on the network's website read,

[01:57:03.720 --> 01:57:05.220]
anti-war rallies delight Iraq,

[01:57:05.720 --> 01:57:08.900]
and the accompanying picture showed marchers in Baghdad, not London or New York.

[01:57:09.560 --> 01:57:12.720]
This wasn't all the way the rest of the world's media reported Saturday's events,

[01:57:12.720 --> 01:57:13.940]
but it was now the character.

[01:57:14.100 --> 01:57:17.820]
For months, both US major cable news networks have acted as if the decision

[01:57:17.820 --> 01:57:20.340]
to invade Iraq has already been made and have been effected

[01:57:20.340 --> 01:57:23.280]
as their job to prepare the American public for the coming war.

[01:57:23.740 --> 01:57:26.520]
So it's not surprising that the target audience is a bit blurry

[01:57:26.520 --> 01:57:29.400]
about the distinction between the Iraqi regime and al-Qaeda.

[01:57:29.860 --> 01:57:33.200]
Surveys show that a majority of Americans think that some or all of the 9-11

[01:57:33.200 --> 01:57:37.280]
hijackers were Iraqi, while many believe that Saddam Hussein was involved in 9-11,

[01:57:37.580 --> 01:57:39.540]
acclaim even the Bush administration has never made.

[01:57:40.240 --> 01:57:43.240]
And since many Americans think that the need for war against Saddam is obvious,

[01:57:43.620 --> 01:57:45.800]
they think that Europeans won't go along our cowards.

[01:57:46.800 --> 01:57:50.100]
Europeans who don't see the same things on TV are former inclined to wonder

[01:57:50.100 --> 01:57:52.940]
why Iraq, rather than North Korea, or for that matter, Al-Qaeda,

[01:57:53.240 --> 01:57:54.940]
has become the focus of US policy.

[01:57:55.560 --> 01:57:57.680]
That's why so many of them question American motor,

[01:57:57.680 --> 01:58:01.100]
suspecting that it's all about oil, or that the administration is simply picking

[01:58:01.100 --> 01:58:02.780]
out a convenient enemy and knows it can defeat.

[01:58:03.160 --> 01:58:05.500]
They don't see opposition to an Iraq war as cowardice.

[01:58:05.800 --> 01:58:08.220]
They see it as courage, a matter of standing up to the bullying,

[01:58:08.580 --> 01:58:09.320]
Bush administration.

[01:58:10.020 --> 01:58:13.400]
There are two possible explanations for the great transatlantic media divide.

[01:58:13.780 --> 01:58:16.940]
One is that European media have a pervasive anti-American bias that leads

[01:58:16.940 --> 01:58:20.940]
them to distort news, even in countries like the UK, where leaders of both major

[01:58:20.940 --> 01:58:23.100]
parties are pro-bushed and support an attack on Iraq.

[01:58:23.580 --> 01:58:26.800]
The other is that some US media outlets operating an environment in which

[01:58:26.800 --> 01:58:29.980]
anyone who questions the administration's foreign policy is accused of being

[01:58:29.980 --> 01:58:33.980]
unpatriotic have taken it as their assignment to sell the war, not to present

[01:58:33.980 --> 01:58:37.240]
a mix of information that might call the justification for or into question.

[01:58:37.700 --> 01:58:38.360]
So which is it?

[01:58:38.520 --> 01:58:42.300]
I've reported you decide since Paul Krugman in today's New York Times.

[01:58:44.640 --> 01:58:46.100]
The usual protesters.

[01:58:46.520 --> 01:58:50.940]
Oh, that Fox Man, he can't complain about their news because they don't present it.

[01:58:53.060 --> 01:58:54.860]
Here's a call from Pembroke Park.

[01:58:55.080 --> 01:58:55.200]
Hello.

[01:58:55.200 --> 01:58:58.840]
Hey, you know, one Mr. Looking for Mr. Goodbar.

[01:58:59.420 --> 01:58:59.880]
Okay.

[01:59:00.720 --> 01:59:04.200]
And the other, the credit card guy that just called you is absolutely correct.

[01:59:05.060 --> 01:59:10.800]
Even if the guy gives you the card and you take an ID from the card from the guy

[01:59:10.800 --> 01:59:14.920]
and they dispute that charge, the merchant is still responsible.

[01:59:15.040 --> 01:59:15.620]
It's still stuck.

[01:59:15.920 --> 01:59:16.940]
And still stuck for it.

[01:59:18.100 --> 01:59:23.340]
And also, have you ever watched the subway ads when the Jared guy is on there

[01:59:23.340 --> 01:59:24.680]
for the diet thing?

[01:59:25.340 --> 01:59:28.620]
If you look at the bottom of the screen where they have a little tagline,

[01:59:29.060 --> 01:59:33.860]
it says subway is a registered trademark of the American Medical Association.

[01:59:35.520 --> 01:59:35.920]
Really?

[01:59:36.180 --> 01:59:36.360]
Yeah.

[01:59:36.880 --> 01:59:37.720]
What does that mean?

[01:59:38.020 --> 01:59:38.660]
I have no idea.

[01:59:38.740 --> 01:59:39.100]
I don't know.

[01:59:39.960 --> 01:59:41.780]
But I've watched it and I saw that.

[01:59:41.980 --> 01:59:44.980]
I'll tell you what, if I see Jared one more time, I'm going to puke my guts out.

[01:59:45.060 --> 01:59:45.980]
I can't stand him.

[01:59:46.260 --> 01:59:49.900]
Yeah, I mean, I started to think maybe the American Medical Association owned subway

[01:59:49.900 --> 01:59:50.420]
so I'm one.

[01:59:51.040 --> 01:59:56.580]
But on the bottom of the tagline, it says subway is a registered trademark of American Medical Association.

[01:59:57.140 --> 02:00:00.220]
I'll tell you, I'm going to find out about that because I've got a friend that owns two subway franchises

[02:00:00.220 --> 02:00:00.880]
and I will find out.

[02:00:01.100 --> 02:00:01.460]
All righty.

[02:00:01.840 --> 02:00:02.380]
Thanks a lot, Pat.

[02:00:02.880 --> 02:00:04.640]
See, there's four out of five out of credit cards.

[02:00:06.260 --> 02:00:07.180]
Now let me ask you this.

[02:00:07.300 --> 02:00:07.840]
Would you eat subway?

[02:00:09.480 --> 02:00:09.700]
Ah, yeah.

[02:00:09.700 --> 02:00:10.340]
What has this passed?

[02:00:10.880 --> 02:00:11.740]
You don't have to answer the question.

[02:00:11.740 --> 02:00:13.060]
Oh, it was a rhetorical question.

[02:00:13.320 --> 02:00:13.440]
Okay.

[02:00:13.720 --> 02:00:14.900]
Oh, it sounded pretty direct.

[02:00:15.380 --> 02:00:18.260]
You want to look like Jared or whatever's name is?

[02:00:18.260 --> 02:00:19.060]
I think I could have tried.

[02:00:19.620 --> 02:00:21.260]
Man, he bugs me.

[02:00:21.380 --> 02:00:21.900]
Oh, you're right.

[02:00:22.100 --> 02:00:26.640]
And then those spots up here, because subway is a humongous franchise in Canada, I mean, it's

[02:00:26.640 --> 02:00:27.700]
just gigantic up here.

[02:00:28.380 --> 02:00:29.340]
And like, here we have 10 seconds.

[02:00:29.500 --> 02:00:30.380]
Here we have 10 seconds.

[02:00:30.500 --> 02:00:31.700]
There's Jared on your screen again.

[02:00:31.740 --> 02:00:32.740]
Just bugging a crap out of you.

[02:00:32.980 --> 02:00:33.680]
Jared, you're my hero.

[02:00:35.180 --> 02:00:35.900]
You know what?

[02:00:35.980 --> 02:00:39.180]
Another year is coming gone and it's middle of February already, but a lot of people are

[02:00:39.180 --> 02:00:40.820]
still getting their life back together for the new year.

[02:00:40.980 --> 02:00:43.600]
And as a result, they want to get everything looking in tip-top shape.

[02:00:43.900 --> 02:00:44.400]
How do you do that?

[02:00:44.500 --> 02:00:47.320]
One of the ways is to call my good pizons at drug concepts.

[02:00:47.860 --> 02:00:48.940]
What a job they do.

[02:00:49.080 --> 02:00:52.180]
When your carpets don't look brand new, these people will come in without the expensive

[02:00:52.180 --> 02:00:55.920]
buying brand new carpeting and make them look like you just had new carpeting laid right

[02:00:55.920 --> 02:00:56.440]
on the floor.

[02:00:56.640 --> 02:00:58.580]
There's nothing like it in laid right on the floor.

[02:00:58.940 --> 02:00:59.240]
That's right.

[02:00:59.320 --> 02:01:03.020]
They really look and smell just like brand new lemony fresh because they dry clean your

[02:01:03.020 --> 02:01:03.480]
carpets.

[02:01:03.560 --> 02:01:07.240]
So the only company in the world that does this and believe me, you will see and feel

[02:01:07.240 --> 02:01:09.200]
the difference and smell and all these other things.

[02:01:09.560 --> 02:01:10.660]
And the same for your carpeting.

[02:01:10.940 --> 02:01:14.460]
I mean, for your drapery rather, expensive area rugs and your poultry as well, all your

[02:01:14.460 --> 02:01:16.140]
good stuff that make it look just like brand new.

[02:01:16.140 --> 02:01:19.860]
And if you have a problem with pen orders, milled orders caused by water damage, like a

[02:01:19.860 --> 02:01:23.480]
magic one, they'll wave it right in your room and make it go away and just like brand

[02:01:23.480 --> 02:01:23.680]
new.

[02:01:23.940 --> 02:01:26.580]
So if you want to get a great deal, always at a guaranteed written price that they

[02:01:26.580 --> 02:01:30.100]
give you before they start the job, do what I've been doing in my house for over 20 years

[02:01:30.100 --> 02:01:31.500]
and everybody else with the brain is doing.

[02:01:31.840 --> 02:01:35.520]
Catch on to the secret of dry concepts because they are simply the best in the world.

[02:01:35.820 --> 02:01:36.520]
Call them tool free.

[02:01:36.680 --> 02:01:37.380]
They won't let you down.

[02:01:37.380 --> 02:01:39.980]

I'm a pretty 2.560 WQM where he leaves me limp man, where to gear he makes me nauseous,

[02:03:31.340 --> 02:03:32.160]
him and Bruce Willis.

[02:03:32.960 --> 02:03:36.160]
There's just a few of those guys and of course with the majority of the heterosexual population

[02:03:36.160 --> 02:03:39.980]
out there, if there's a sex scene in a movie like this, we're talking about today, or even

[02:03:39.980 --> 02:03:42.000]
in a porn movie, they don't care what the guy looks like anyway.

[02:03:42.500 --> 02:03:45.660]
Maybe it makes them feel better about themselves if the guys really grotesque.

[02:03:45.780 --> 02:03:46.600]
You mean like Ron Jeremy?

[02:03:47.020 --> 02:03:47.660]
Oh sorry Ron.

[02:03:47.840 --> 02:03:48.000]
You're like that.

[02:03:48.980 --> 02:03:51.340]
Sorry Ronny, you disgusting fat Harry pig.

[02:03:51.920 --> 02:03:53.900]
Anyway in the realm of the senses, did you see this one?

[02:03:53.960 --> 02:03:55.680]
Yeah, I never heard of it but I wrote it down.

[02:03:55.860 --> 02:04:00.920]
Language Japanese subtitles, English, in the realm of the senses there's this story of

[02:04:00.920 --> 02:04:04.720]
an ex prostitute who becomes involved in an obsessive love affair with the master of

[02:04:04.720 --> 02:04:08.380]
household where she's employed as a servant in the realm of the senses, okay?

[02:04:08.900 --> 02:04:09.060]
All right.

[02:04:10.180 --> 02:04:12.060]
And Lynn Samuels is okay, she's alive.

[02:04:12.220 --> 02:04:14.540]
By the way, I got your facts excellent, I'm impressed.

[02:04:15.560 --> 02:04:17.720]
That's all I'm gonna say because you said don't say nothing.

[02:04:19.700 --> 02:04:20.060]
Okay.

[02:04:20.640 --> 02:04:22.440]
Well don't ask any questions, got it?

[02:04:22.440 --> 02:04:24.080]
My wife looks fine, have a nice day.

[02:04:25.060 --> 02:04:28.140]
Dress to kill somebody says, what does it say here from Sean?

[02:04:28.580 --> 02:04:31.200]
Not the chronic Sean's model but some of the Sean.

[02:04:32.260 --> 02:04:36.600]
It says, two movies dressed together with Angie Dickinson at the shower scene in the

[02:04:36.600 --> 02:04:36.900]
beginning.

[02:04:37.120 --> 02:04:38.580]
What about the scene in the taxi cab?

[02:04:38.760 --> 02:04:39.420]
Didn't they do it in the cab?

[02:04:39.680 --> 02:04:40.120]
Yeah I guess.

[02:04:41.100 --> 02:04:41.940]
You didn't see Dress to kill?

[02:04:41.940 --> 02:04:42.880]
Yeah, 100 years ago.

[02:04:43.320 --> 02:04:45.460]
Oh come on, that was an excellent movie with Michael King.

[02:04:45.580 --> 02:04:46.080]
Yeah it was great.

[02:04:46.240 --> 02:04:50.300]
And Angie Dickinson, before she knew Larry King and her body double.

[02:04:51.200 --> 02:04:51.460]
Right.

[02:04:52.360 --> 02:04:55.360]
And no way out with Kevin Costner, it says the sex scene in the limo.

[02:04:55.580 --> 02:04:58.380]
No way out we put that down too but Kevin Costner was in it.

[02:04:58.500 --> 02:04:58.780]
Oh.

[02:04:58.780 --> 02:04:59.020]
Oh.

[02:05:00.620 --> 02:05:01.960]
Hey he's no Mickey Rourke.

[02:05:02.480 --> 02:05:03.720]
Yeah there's another one.

[02:05:03.980 --> 02:05:04.280]
Right.

[02:05:04.820 --> 02:05:08.820]
See I get to feel like I don't know and Lynn Samuel says the most erotic sex scene she

[02:05:08.820 --> 02:05:10.320]
ever saw in a movie was in Don't Look Now.

[02:05:11.200 --> 02:05:11.600]
Okay.

[02:05:12.100 --> 02:05:12.820]
Got it down?

[02:05:13.380 --> 02:05:14.160]
Don't look now.

[02:05:14.480 --> 02:05:15.200]
Don't look now.

[02:05:15.480 --> 02:05:16.220]
My, my, my.

[02:05:17.300 --> 02:05:19.540]
What was the most erotic movie you've ever seen?

[02:05:19.740 --> 02:05:20.400]
Not X rated.

[02:05:20.540 --> 02:05:22.620]
Nine and a half weeks 46, body heat 43.

[02:05:23.040 --> 02:05:23.460]
By the way.

[02:05:23.600 --> 02:05:23.940]
By the way.

[02:05:23.940 --> 02:05:24.300]
Yes.

[02:05:24.680 --> 02:05:26.820]
Speaking to nine and a half weeks and Mickey Rourke.

[02:05:26.880 --> 02:05:27.240]
Yes.

[02:05:27.240 --> 02:05:31.260]
Kim Basinger said of her episode filming that movie with me.

[02:05:31.260 --> 02:05:31.840]
He smelled bad.

[02:05:32.020 --> 02:05:32.780]
He smelled really bad.

[02:05:32.860 --> 02:05:33.440]
He didn't bathe.

[02:05:33.440 --> 02:05:35.140]
He had bad personal hygiene.

[02:05:35.720 --> 02:05:36.040]
Wow.

[02:05:36.200 --> 02:05:36.740]
What a surprise.

[02:05:37.040 --> 02:05:37.500]
Ken O'Hell.

[02:05:37.840 --> 02:05:39.060]
So big deal.

[02:05:40.200 --> 02:05:41.120]
Uh, Blue Lagoon.

[02:05:41.120 --> 02:05:43.100]
At least, at least he looked up to his billing anyway.

[02:05:45.360 --> 02:05:47.460]
Nine and a half weeks 46, body heat 43.

[02:05:47.620 --> 02:05:50.500]
Blue Lagoon way in third place, way on ESN 21.

[02:05:51.080 --> 02:05:52.480]
Basic instinct 16.

[02:05:52.900 --> 02:05:54.300]
Last time you went Paris 14.

[02:05:55.040 --> 02:05:55.880]
I never saw that.

[02:05:55.940 --> 02:05:56.920]
Must have been highly overrated.

[02:05:58.500 --> 02:06:00.040]
And very old ancient.

[02:06:00.680 --> 02:06:02.840]
Lyle Orchard 14 fatal of fraction 13.

[02:06:03.520 --> 02:06:04.300]
Unfaithful 12.

[02:06:04.480 --> 02:06:05.360]
Mulholland Drive 10.

[02:06:05.520 --> 02:06:06.020]
Now we're talking.

[02:06:06.420 --> 02:06:07.120]
Monsters balls.

[02:06:07.540 --> 02:06:07.720]
Nine.

[02:06:08.780 --> 02:06:09.460]
Summer lovers eight.

[02:06:09.800 --> 02:06:11.440]
Two moon Kakamoon junction eight.

[02:06:11.760 --> 02:06:13.180]
Postman always comes twice eight.

[02:06:13.480 --> 02:06:14.120]
Wild things eight.

[02:06:14.480 --> 02:06:15.520]
And summer 42 seven.

[02:06:15.740 --> 02:06:16.620]
Down from their coast.

[02:06:17.260 --> 02:06:17.580]
Got it.

[02:06:18.040 --> 02:06:18.420]
Got it.

[02:06:18.700 --> 02:06:19.340]
As we're building.

[02:06:19.420 --> 02:06:20.880]
Now, see, this is the way to do it, Carlos.

[02:06:21.160 --> 02:06:23.020]
Unlike the way we did yesterday, which is okay.

[02:06:23.140 --> 02:06:24.540]
We had almost 850 votes.

[02:06:24.540 --> 02:06:25.020]
I'm like that.

[02:06:25.140 --> 02:06:25.340]
You know.

[02:06:25.340 --> 02:06:27.680]
But this is better.

[02:06:28.360 --> 02:06:29.060]
Don't you agree?

[02:06:30.280 --> 02:06:30.460]
Yeah.

[02:06:32.020 --> 02:06:32.920]
As if you had a choice.

[02:06:33.060 --> 02:06:33.760]
My phone is ringing.

[02:06:33.800 --> 02:06:34.940]
It must be a package on says.

[02:06:35.040 --> 02:06:36.160]
Can you hear my phone ringing in the back?

[02:06:36.360 --> 02:06:36.460]
No.

[02:06:36.680 --> 02:06:36.860]
Good.

[02:06:37.120 --> 02:06:37.860]
God, that was scary.

[02:06:38.060 --> 02:06:40.140]
I didn't hear it jumped out of the seat right here in the middle of the show.

[02:06:40.960 --> 02:06:42.040]
The phone is ringing in the other room.

[02:06:42.680 --> 02:06:43.040]
Yeah.

[02:06:43.620 --> 02:06:45.720]
Or maybe it could be a, or could be Ed McMahon.

[02:06:45.840 --> 02:06:48.160]
Or it could be Jeff Cohen from the pizza lot.

[02:06:49.720 --> 02:06:50.400]
Hello, Neil.

[02:06:50.920 --> 02:06:51.500]
Yes, Jeff.

[02:06:52.200 --> 02:06:54.020]
I'm sorry to hear that you aren't feeling good.

[02:06:54.020 --> 02:06:55.780]
I was late to hear.

[02:06:56.720 --> 02:06:57.080]
Yeah.

[02:06:57.380 --> 02:06:59.440]
Well, you're usually a little bit behind the eight balls.

[02:06:59.880 --> 02:07:00.300]
That's true.

[02:07:00.440 --> 02:07:01.320]
Are you feeling all right now?

[02:07:01.520 --> 02:07:02.180]
I'm feeling pretty good.

[02:07:02.200 --> 02:07:02.680]
I'm coming along.

[02:07:02.780 --> 02:07:03.100]
Not bad.

[02:07:03.460 --> 02:07:06.340]
I need you at least to make it till the plantation store is doing good.

[02:07:06.480 --> 02:07:07.140]
You know what I'm saying?

[02:07:09.020 --> 02:07:09.020]

[02:07:09.560 --> 02:07:13.500]
You need to keep me alive for another few months until I get that thing up to speed and plantation.

[02:07:13.980 --> 02:07:14.240]
Right.

[02:07:14.540 --> 02:07:14.540]

[02:07:14.740 --> 02:07:16.300]
Now I'm healing sunrise and plantation.

[02:07:16.540 --> 02:07:20.100]
Go in here and buy a bunch of food because he's feeding the rimers for free.

[02:07:20.540 --> 02:07:21.740]
I'll leave me hanging, dude.

[02:07:21.740 --> 02:07:22.640]
Get better.

[02:07:24.120 --> 02:07:27.360]
Listen, I needed to use you a little bit for change.

[02:07:27.380 --> 02:07:27.380]

[02:07:27.640 --> 02:07:28.660]
Well, what a, for change.

[02:07:28.760 --> 02:07:29.660]
How unusual, yeah.

[02:07:29.860 --> 02:07:30.000]
Right.

[02:07:30.360 --> 02:07:32.440]
I just got a delivery from city furniture.

[02:07:33.060 --> 02:07:34.700]
My two little kids got dead.

[02:07:35.020 --> 02:07:37.340]
They put it together in the wrong rooms.

[02:07:37.560 --> 02:07:39.980]
And I can't get through to them on their phone number.

[02:07:40.080 --> 02:07:41.500]
I was on hold for 15 minutes.

[02:07:42.260 --> 02:07:43.360]
And nobody's answering.

[02:07:43.400 --> 02:07:48.360]
If my kids come home from school and they're better in the wrong room, they're going to be traumatized and never want to go back to city.

[02:07:48.360 --> 02:07:49.740]
A big, really guy like you.

[02:07:49.840 --> 02:07:51.520]
Why don't you just move around yourself?

[02:07:52.100 --> 02:07:52.900]
I can't.

[02:07:52.940 --> 02:07:54.480]
Sorry, they got to be put together and stuff.

[02:07:54.940 --> 02:07:55.280]
Yeah.

[02:07:55.820 --> 02:08:00.960]
So anyway, I was hoping somebody from city furniture might hear this and call.

[02:08:01.380 --> 02:08:01.660]
Okay.

[02:08:01.720 --> 02:08:02.840]
I'll give people at city furniture.

[02:08:02.940 --> 02:08:07.100]
Jeff Cohen from the pizza loft is pissed off and he's giving you some bad publicity on the air.

[02:08:07.720 --> 02:08:08.320]
And you would like to read.

[02:08:08.520 --> 02:08:14.460]
I've talked to the, I've talked as a matter of fact that they can respond so quick to put the beds where they're supposed to be before I get kids get out of school.

[02:08:14.900 --> 02:08:15.620]
That would be wonderful.

[02:08:16.040 --> 02:08:16.440]
Right.

[02:08:16.760 --> 02:08:18.520]
And then you might even feed them for free for a while.

[02:08:18.800 --> 02:08:21.820]
You might, but I already told you there are other drivers because I wasn't there.

[02:08:22.300 --> 02:08:23.140]
Just like the rimmers.

[02:08:23.660 --> 02:08:24.020]
Unbelievable.

[02:08:24.840 --> 02:08:25.160]
Unbelievable.

[02:08:25.560 --> 02:08:27.800]
Anyway, I appreciate you letting me use you once again.

[02:08:29.200 --> 02:08:29.980]
Stay healthy.

[02:08:30.360 --> 02:08:30.760]
Anytime.

[02:08:31.480 --> 02:08:33.120]
And do some exercise, man.

[02:08:33.260 --> 02:08:34.400]
We talked about it in the past.

[02:08:34.880 --> 02:08:35.640]
Say goodbye, Jeff.

[02:08:36.160 --> 02:08:36.640]
Bye, Neil.

[02:08:37.780 --> 02:08:39.760]
Okay, Jeff Cohen from the pizza loft real free loader.

[02:08:40.080 --> 02:08:43.620]
But anyway, people with city furniture take care of him because he can be really dangerous, you know?

[02:08:45.080 --> 02:08:48.320]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T line.

[02:08:48.460 --> 02:08:50.860]
So we had two tremendous, like almost personal calls.

[02:08:50.940 --> 02:08:55.880]
Fat Rich yesterday to tell us that Brian Sears won eight races at Pompe and O'Park on last Saturday night.

[02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:57.900]
And that this Saturday is the big ol' like a pre-final.

[02:08:58.040 --> 02:08:58.620]
And I haven't a big night.

[02:08:58.620 --> 02:09:00.480]
And he had the two of it in 147 and the six broke.

[02:09:00.840 --> 02:09:04.820]
And then we had the Jeff Cohen just now asking for a personal favor about his kids furniture.

[02:09:06.100 --> 02:09:08.820]
Then I think you feel like really loved and wanted and useful.

[02:09:09.720 --> 02:09:10.040]
Yeah.

[02:09:10.540 --> 02:09:12.920]
Well, you know, like he said, at least he was honest about it.

[02:09:13.020 --> 02:09:16.260]
As long as you're still alive, Neil, let me use you and get the plantations through up to speed.

[02:09:16.520 --> 02:09:16.580]
Right.

[02:09:16.620 --> 02:09:19.280]
Let me see if you can't straighten out my furniture problem from city furniture.

[02:09:20.080 --> 02:09:20.680]
Which why not?

[02:09:21.020 --> 02:09:21.760]
That's what I'm here for.

[02:09:22.080 --> 02:09:22.820]
I'm here to serve.

[02:09:24.440 --> 02:09:27.840]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T.

[02:09:27.860 --> 02:09:28.420]
Here's Miami.

[02:09:28.440 --> 02:09:28.760]
Hello.

[02:09:29.360 --> 02:09:30.300]
Hi. How are you, Neil?

[02:09:30.520 --> 02:09:30.740]
Okay.

[02:09:31.840 --> 02:09:36.820]
First of all, before I tell you the films, you were talking about Alfred Hitchcock before.

[02:09:36.820 --> 02:09:41.840]
And I think to someone said, rear window was not remade as a movie.

[02:09:42.020 --> 02:09:43.500]
I've never seen it, but it was remade.

[02:09:43.740 --> 02:09:45.300]
And actually they had a perfect casting.

[02:09:45.480 --> 02:09:47.480]
They had Christopher Reeben, the wheelchair.

[02:09:47.900 --> 02:09:48.560]
Oh, that's right.

[02:09:48.700 --> 02:09:48.920]
That thing.

[02:09:48.920 --> 02:09:49.280]
You're right.

[02:09:49.580 --> 02:09:50.640]
You're absolutely right.

[02:09:51.040 --> 02:09:52.320]
And that was another one.

[02:09:52.560 --> 02:09:53.300]
That was another one.

[02:09:53.360 --> 02:09:54.400]
It never should have been remade.

[02:09:54.680 --> 02:09:54.860]
Right.

[02:09:55.440 --> 02:09:55.560]
Yeah.

[02:09:55.740 --> 02:09:56.640]
Oh, there's a lot of them.

[02:09:58.040 --> 02:10:02.520]
Also, before I tell you my films, you might have to take off last hang on Paris if you're saying that.

[02:10:03.740 --> 02:10:04.880]
Not X-rated film.

[02:10:04.880 --> 02:10:05.800]
Yeah, I think you're right.

[02:10:05.940 --> 02:10:06.860]
I think it wasn't X-rated film.

[02:10:06.860 --> 02:10:07.900]
That was an X-rated film.

[02:10:08.380 --> 02:10:08.520]
Oh.

[02:10:09.520 --> 02:10:16.380]
I hate to burst all those people's bubbles and mall and brando, but that was an X-rated film.

[02:10:16.760 --> 02:10:17.160]
Yeah, you're right.

[02:10:17.320 --> 02:10:18.740]
Okay. Take that off of there, please, Eric.

[02:10:18.900 --> 02:10:21.680]
I thought about that at first, and then I thought, well, nobody else said anything.

[02:10:21.680 --> 02:10:22.860]
So I'll just dummy up, you know.

[02:10:22.940 --> 02:10:23.320]
But you're right.

[02:10:23.620 --> 02:10:23.900]
Okay.

[02:10:24.380 --> 02:10:30.900]
The three that I would like to mention, a couple of them while I've been on the phone, you've already mentioned bound.

[02:10:31.640 --> 02:10:31.820]
Right.

[02:10:31.820 --> 02:10:35.260]
I just mentioned Dress to Kill, which also had Nancy Allen.

[02:10:37.860 --> 02:10:40.040]
And another film, The Hunger.

[02:10:41.580 --> 02:10:42.500]
From The Hunger?

[02:10:42.960 --> 02:10:45.680]
The Hunger with Susan Sarandon and Kevin De Nouve.

[02:10:46.180 --> 02:10:47.220]
On Kevin De Nouve?

[02:10:47.500 --> 02:10:48.060]
And David Bowie.

[02:10:48.260 --> 02:10:49.600]
And David Bowie, that's right.

[02:10:49.820 --> 02:10:51.140]
Oh, my God.

[02:10:51.540 --> 02:10:54.760]
But he was not really in that erotic scene.

[02:10:54.980 --> 02:10:57.820]
I wonder who is the richest one in Amelbeach, or wasn't him?

[02:10:58.980 --> 02:11:01.740]
Actually, it was an excellent non-bam part.

[02:11:02.020 --> 02:11:02.880]
Yeah, yes, you didn't say that.

[02:11:02.960 --> 02:11:03.600]
Yeah, good movie.

[02:11:03.920 --> 02:11:04.500]
Yeah, so it's very good.

[02:11:04.500 --> 02:11:05.420]
Okay, thanks a lot, Pali.

[02:11:05.660 --> 02:11:06.260]
Have a great day.

[02:11:06.640 --> 02:11:07.100]
And back to you.

[02:11:07.480 --> 02:11:14.960]
20-till noon at 5.60 W.D.C., when the list is getting bigger and expanding and growing like the Jack and the Beanstalk.

[02:11:16.260 --> 02:11:18.540]
You know, for years I've been telling you about the health benefits of Oli.

[02:11:18.540 --> 02:11:20.320]
I mean, look at a healthy guy like me, for example.

[02:11:20.700 --> 02:11:20.840]
Right.

[02:11:20.920 --> 02:11:22.080]
And I keep telling you what?

[02:11:22.420 --> 02:11:22.620]
Huh?

[02:11:23.040 --> 02:11:25.720]
Well, if they would send me some of the stuff I'd pop in my purse, okay?

[02:11:25.720 --> 02:11:26.880]
At this point, I'll take anything.

[02:11:27.420 --> 02:11:30.240]
And I keep telling you because this stuff really works for a lot of people out there.

[02:11:30.380 --> 02:11:34.960]

And now we've got three brand new formulas from Oliomet.

which trust me when I tell you, is very important for your heart.

[02:12:03.100 --> 02:12:04.680]
My heart's good, by the way, I got a good squeeze.

They've just tasted your snack.

[02:12:42.420 --> 02:12:46.080]
American Idol is bad on TV.

[02:12:47.700 --> 02:12:51.440]
American Idol, who's it going to be?

[02:12:53.320 --> 02:12:58.540]
We're going to find out who can sing and who will hear some nasty things.

[02:12:58.800 --> 02:13:02.200]
Here's your chance of life on fame like I can't even shit.

[02:13:02.200 --> 02:13:04.520]
American Idol watches fame, aim voters.

[02:13:05.060 --> 02:13:07.660]
It's up to you.

[02:13:08.500 --> 02:13:12.620]
American Idol, it's season two.

[02:13:13.500 --> 02:13:17.340]
American Idol, two days a week.

[02:13:18.420 --> 02:13:22.700]
American Idol, you're the sure can't shrink.

[02:13:24.600 --> 02:13:26.680]
Simon Cowell is an evil chap.

[02:13:27.260 --> 02:13:29.240]
You'll just want to give a hell of a slap.

[02:13:29.240 --> 02:13:32.120]
Ryan St. Gris is all alone.

[02:13:32.260 --> 02:13:34.900]
Now that things have become a little home.

[02:13:34.940 --> 02:13:37.080]
Randy Jetson's still on board.

[02:13:37.580 --> 02:13:38.880]
He's having me out on my door.

[02:13:39.400 --> 02:13:43.180]
American Idol, right now it's cool.

[02:13:44.240 --> 02:13:48.060]
How soon will it be like all I have to?

[02:13:50.680 --> 02:13:53.520]
And if you're holding off, it'll get off now.

[02:13:53.680 --> 02:13:54.020]
Go, go.

[02:13:54.800 --> 02:13:56.540]
I'm going to watch you, Simon.

[02:13:56.540 --> 02:13:59.100]
But I don't like you, Simon.

[02:14:00.140 --> 02:14:00.580]
Bye.

[02:14:01.460 --> 02:14:01.720]
Bye.

[02:14:04.280 --> 02:14:06.180]
Live in 45 at 5.60 W.

[02:14:06.320 --> 02:14:09.140]
Here's a fact from somebody who sent this.

[02:14:10.400 --> 02:14:11.680]
Chris and Boca, thank you, Chris.

[02:14:12.600 --> 02:14:14.440]
Your website is a treasure trove and you're right.

[02:14:14.820 --> 02:14:17.800]
You are the man for this liberal progressive radio syndicate.

[02:14:17.980 --> 02:14:18.060]
No.

[02:14:18.780 --> 02:14:20.720]
A chronic non-collar, Chris and Boca who loves you,

[02:14:20.840 --> 02:14:23.080]
educated degenerate masses, please,

[02:14:23.300 --> 02:14:24.400]
if you wanted to tweak the self-righteous,

[02:14:24.400 --> 02:14:26.160]
raise the stakes, Al Frankenmines,

[02:14:26.480 --> 02:14:29.380]
and it's the same story again about how the liberals want to put together a radio network.

[02:14:29.500 --> 02:14:29.640]
No.

[02:14:29.780 --> 02:14:30.180]
No, thanks.

[02:14:30.820 --> 02:14:33.360]
Not going back ever to that so-called

[02:14:33.740 --> 02:14:35.420]
topical change-the-world talk radio,

[02:14:35.720 --> 02:14:37.300]
because there are no market for it.

[02:14:38.700 --> 02:14:40.100]
Liberals are like ostriches.

[02:14:40.200 --> 02:14:41.900]
They have their heads in the sand, even like moderates.

[02:14:42.020 --> 02:14:45.320]
They're busy playing kaka in the idea that especially if you're having a stroke,

[02:14:45.840 --> 02:14:47.240]
I'm going to like stick my head out there.

[02:14:47.600 --> 02:14:48.920]
Let somebody else do it, okay?

[02:14:49.160 --> 02:14:49.680]
Stick it out there.

[02:14:50.460 --> 02:14:51.020]
Yeah, stick it out.

[02:14:51.160 --> 02:14:52.060]
When it doubts, stick it out.

[02:14:52.060 --> 02:14:54.140]
Thanks anyway, Chris, but the answer is still.

[02:14:54.380 --> 02:14:54.700]
Absolutely.

[02:14:54.820 --> 02:14:54.940]
No.

[02:14:55.560 --> 02:14:56.760]
And you're right about the website.

[02:14:56.920 --> 02:14:59.640]
I only wish that more and more people would go on there and read our bedtime stories.

[02:15:00.540 --> 02:15:01.520]
Good stuff on there.

[02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:03.620]
Am I right?

[02:15:04.040 --> 02:15:04.360]
Absolutely.

[02:15:05.300 --> 02:15:05.780]
Every color.

[02:15:06.420 --> 02:15:07.200]
Even Carlos agrees.

[02:15:07.340 --> 02:15:08.260]
He's just astonished.

[02:15:08.540 --> 02:15:12.500]
I mean, you know, you can find this stuff if you want to sit around and go to like 600 different websites to find it,

[02:15:12.600 --> 02:15:14.560]
but that's why we put it on there soon, and I have to do that.

[02:15:15.580 --> 02:15:18.560]
And also it gives Carlos and the aircoaches used to uscreen with each other.

[02:15:19.040 --> 02:15:20.820]
Did you put the lover with Jane March on a list?

[02:15:20.820 --> 02:15:21.060]
Yes.

[02:15:21.520 --> 02:15:22.060]
You did?

[02:15:22.220 --> 02:15:22.500]
Yes.

[02:15:22.600 --> 02:15:23.440]
Well, that's what it says here on this fact.

[02:15:23.600 --> 02:15:24.680]
We put the lover with Jane March.

[02:15:24.860 --> 02:15:25.540]
I don't know who she is.

[02:15:25.620 --> 02:15:28.100]
Yeah, yeah, she's really cute, really cute.

[02:15:28.240 --> 02:15:28.960]
She came to Frederick March?

[02:15:29.400 --> 02:15:29.760]
Unfortunately.

[02:15:30.160 --> 02:15:30.820]
How about how March?

[02:15:31.800 --> 02:15:32.720]
Or the eyes of?

[02:15:34.420 --> 02:15:34.720]
March.

[02:15:34.860 --> 02:15:35.480]
Unfortunately what?

[02:15:36.200 --> 02:15:38.940]
I don't know if it's that one or another one that she's in with Bruce Willis.

[02:15:39.420 --> 02:15:39.620]
Ah!

[02:15:40.120 --> 02:15:40.300]
Ah!

[02:15:41.120 --> 02:15:42.560]
It's all close to lunchtime, too.

[02:15:43.020 --> 02:15:46.520]
The good news is that I looked for that candy wrapper that almond brittle and I couldn't find it.

[02:15:48.140 --> 02:15:51.020]
So I must have thrown it out in the trash, damn it.

[02:15:51.240 --> 02:16:00.600]
Well, I'll go buy the keyest store, the convenience store next time, and of course I won't buy one at all, but I'll look at the label and see who the manufacturers who makes it because believe me if you like candy.

[02:16:00.840 --> 02:16:01.000]
Oh!

[02:16:01.940 --> 02:16:06.660]
Almond brittle, you have never in your life tasted there two big squares of it in each year, a little pack.

[02:16:07.920 --> 02:16:11.640]
And by the time you get them with that you'll say, I'm going to go back and buy ten or twelve more of those.

[02:16:11.760 --> 02:16:12.660]
Damn it, those are just.

[02:16:13.100 --> 02:16:14.020]
See, that's the problem.

[02:16:14.520 --> 02:16:26.360]
That's why we're all dying over here because everything, now this story about healthy ice cream is on a website which I'm not going to read it because it's too much bedtime stories, too much reading, but could eating ice cream make you healthier if so it might also make someone rich.

[02:16:26.880 --> 02:16:34.140]
There is growing interest in adding new, new, new, pharmaceuticals, foods with medicinal properties to ice cream, new, pharmaceuticals, okay?

[02:16:34.420 --> 02:16:34.620]
Ah!

[02:16:35.200 --> 02:16:36.660]
See, I'm choking just from saying that.

[02:16:37.700 --> 02:16:48.080]
Getting them in ice cream is relatively easy research, you say the trick is to do it in such a way that the finished product still tastes like ice cream and not like fish as this happened in some early experiments.

[02:16:48.100 --> 02:16:49.500]
Oh, how about for fish food?

[02:16:50.120 --> 02:16:51.160]
Okay, the natural.

[02:16:51.620 --> 02:16:52.260]
That might do it.

[02:16:53.700 --> 02:16:58.800]
There are a lot of people who don't want us to screw up their ice cream since Bob Roberts associate professor of food, sides of Penn State.

[02:16:59.180 --> 02:17:01.640]
These are the same people who say are eating it because it tastes good.

[02:17:01.980 --> 02:17:03.800]
I don't eat it because it's good for me.

[02:17:03.800 --> 02:17:08.800]
Well, I mean, does anybody really eat anything because it's good for them unless they think it tastes good?

[02:17:08.800 --> 02:17:13.140]
I mean, I like broccoli which you don't, but I don't eat it specifically because it's good for me.

[02:17:13.380 --> 02:17:16.440]
I eat it because it's supposed to be good for me and I like the way it tastes.

[02:17:16.660 --> 02:17:20.000]
There are probably some grunola minded people that do that kind of thing.

[02:17:20.020 --> 02:17:21.020]
Oh, like you were given?

[02:17:21.240 --> 02:17:22.220]
Yeah, he did.

[02:17:22.220 --> 02:17:22.500]
He's done.

[02:17:22.640 --> 02:17:23.860]
He didn't do a lot of good, didn't it?

[02:17:23.900 --> 02:17:24.080]
Yeah.

[02:17:24.440 --> 02:17:25.160]
He's still dead.

[02:17:25.720 --> 02:17:26.300]
Here's Miami.

[02:17:26.440 --> 02:17:26.660]
Hello.

[02:17:27.900 --> 02:17:28.260]
Hello?

[02:17:28.660 --> 02:17:29.040]
Yes, sir.

[02:17:29.700 --> 02:17:31.540]
Yes, I want to add a movie to your phone.

[02:17:31.860 --> 02:17:32.320]
Sure, go ahead.

[02:17:32.320 --> 02:17:34.280]
Okay, the movie is Jade.

[02:17:34.920 --> 02:17:40.000]
I can't remember the name of the lady that was in it for a non-robot caruso,

[02:17:40.160 --> 02:17:42.420]
post-part in it as well.

[02:17:42.840 --> 02:17:44.180]
How old is that movie?

[02:17:45.620 --> 02:17:52.160]
I think the movie is about, I think it came out in about 98, I think.

[02:17:53.860 --> 02:17:57.440]
Because I'm not sure if it's too new to be in my book, but I'm looking for there's jam.

[02:17:58.040 --> 02:17:59.680]
There's Jacob Delired, a Jade.

[02:18:00.460 --> 02:18:02.620]
1995, so it's eight years old.

[02:18:02.740 --> 02:18:03.060]
Oh, how old?

[02:18:03.580 --> 02:18:11.160]
And it's starred, um, Cass David Caruso, Linda Fiorentino, Richard Crenna,

[02:18:11.900 --> 02:18:16.220]
Chaz Palmentieri, Michael, Beane, and Donna Murphy.

[02:18:17.960 --> 02:18:19.040]
And we got it down.

[02:18:19.080 --> 02:18:19.360]
Thanks.

[02:18:19.840 --> 02:18:20.280]
Thank you.

[02:18:20.640 --> 02:18:21.160]
You're welcome.

[02:18:21.340 --> 02:18:21.620]
Got it.

[02:18:21.700 --> 02:18:21.920]
Jade.

[02:18:22.040 --> 02:18:22.240]
Got it.

[02:18:22.240 --> 02:18:22.540]
Okay.

[02:18:23.380 --> 02:18:29.940]
A Friedkin back to the, uh, oh, boy, this print is so small, back to the hackery of the Guardian.

[02:18:31.840 --> 02:18:35.720]
Indeed, from the prowling camera tour of the Baroque Oriental San Francisco,

[02:18:35.880 --> 02:18:40.300]
Manchester Bominionaires Playboy, to the creepy, choral music and jarring soundtrack,

[02:18:40.700 --> 02:18:44.960]
this ugly murder thriller pushes close to horror movie territory.

[02:18:45.860 --> 02:18:46.720]
How do you like that?

[02:18:47.340 --> 02:18:48.040]
I will get it.

[02:18:48.420 --> 02:18:49.660]
The print is too damn small.

[02:18:50.120 --> 02:18:51.720]
Man, it is teeny tiny.

[02:18:52.040 --> 02:18:52.700]
You're going to have to hit him.

[02:18:52.700 --> 02:18:53.840]
My Magdivision reading glass.

[02:18:53.940 --> 02:18:54.700]
Pretty soon, Mr.

[02:18:55.460 --> 02:18:56.520]
He's not going to be an old fart.

[02:18:58.420 --> 02:18:59.740]
51 for nine and a half weeks.

[02:18:59.880 --> 02:19:00.740]
It's pulling away again.

[02:19:00.820 --> 02:19:01.280]
Look out.

[02:19:02.540 --> 02:19:03.720]
Body heat 44.

[02:19:04.240 --> 02:19:04.660]
Blue Lagoon 22.

[02:19:05.620 --> 02:19:06.080]
Small potatoes.

[02:19:06.300 --> 02:19:06.740]
Blue Lagoon.

[02:19:08.380 --> 02:19:10.160]
That's what they said about Chris Ankins, and I'm over.

[02:19:10.220 --> 02:19:10.960]
Wasn't it small potatoes?

[02:19:11.460 --> 02:19:12.460]
Well, the water was cold.

[02:19:13.080 --> 02:19:13.760]
Is that what it was?

[02:19:14.220 --> 02:19:15.360]
What was he doing out there?

[02:19:15.420 --> 02:19:16.800]
Anyway, here's higher Leah.

[02:19:16.900 --> 02:19:17.120]
Hello.

[02:19:18.220 --> 02:19:18.820]
Yeah, Neil.

[02:19:18.820 --> 02:19:19.640]
Yes, sir.

[02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:21.560]
How about showgirls?

[02:19:22.660 --> 02:19:23.100]
Showgirls?

[02:19:23.180 --> 02:19:23.620]
Yes.

[02:19:25.020 --> 02:19:25.740]
How about that?

[02:19:25.940 --> 02:19:27.240]
That stripping movie?

[02:19:27.760 --> 02:19:28.000]
Yeah.

[02:19:28.920 --> 02:19:29.980]
You know that one, George?

[02:19:30.620 --> 02:19:30.760]
Yeah.

[02:19:30.960 --> 02:19:31.640]
Big controversy.

[02:19:31.800 --> 02:19:32.200]
Remember that?

[02:19:32.780 --> 02:19:33.200]
No.

[02:19:33.840 --> 02:19:36.940]
Elizabeth Berkeley, Gina Gershon, La Noudite.

[02:19:37.480 --> 02:19:37.660]
No.

[02:19:37.860 --> 02:19:40.160]
The guy that wrote Basic Instinct took a lot of heat for it.

[02:19:40.480 --> 02:19:42.220]
Basic, a lot of body heat?

[02:19:42.480 --> 02:19:42.600]
Yeah.

[02:19:43.500 --> 02:19:45.460]
I thought we were going to have to have a lot of makeup in it.

[02:19:45.860 --> 02:19:46.280]
How about your porn?

[02:19:46.820 --> 02:19:48.320]
Bad movie, but a lot of nudity.

[02:19:49.020 --> 02:19:49.880]
Well, that's the point.

[02:19:50.040 --> 02:19:50.220]
We did it.

[02:19:50.260 --> 02:19:51.660]
We're not asking which was a good movie.

[02:19:51.780 --> 02:19:53.420]
See, what about Henry and June?

[02:19:53.560 --> 02:19:54.360]
I was on this faceties.

[02:19:54.360 --> 02:19:54.500]
Oh.

[02:19:54.840 --> 02:19:55.120]
You put that.

[02:19:55.600 --> 02:19:55.900]
No?

[02:19:58.020 --> 02:20:00.100]
Well, it was supposed to be an erotic movie.

[02:20:00.200 --> 02:20:00.560]
How's that?

[02:20:01.080 --> 02:20:01.620]
But it wasn't.

[02:20:01.620 --> 02:20:03.320]
It was a scene that was supposed to be erotic between...

[02:20:04.380 --> 02:20:05.320]
No, I can't think of the other.

[02:20:05.320 --> 02:20:06.400]
Henry Fonda and June Allison?

[02:20:06.760 --> 02:20:07.300]
Yeah, there you go.

[02:20:07.700 --> 02:20:07.920]
Uh-huh.

[02:20:09.720 --> 02:20:10.060]
Yeah.

[02:20:10.280 --> 02:20:11.180]
And it was pretty wet.

[02:20:11.380 --> 02:20:12.960]
Is she still alive by the way, June Allison?

[02:20:13.140 --> 02:20:13.620]
I think so.

[02:20:13.880 --> 02:20:14.220]
Leahy.

[02:20:14.680 --> 02:20:14.940]
Huh?

[02:20:14.940 --> 02:20:18.160]
I didn't see she still depends.

[02:20:19.600 --> 02:20:21.460]
Was that June Allison or was that somebody else?

[02:20:21.700 --> 02:20:21.860]
Yeah, it was.

[02:20:21.860 --> 02:20:23.880]
Well, at least our bit accuses her of selling depends.

[02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:24.920]
Yeah, it was June Allison.

[02:20:25.040 --> 02:20:26.100]
That's a long time ago too.

[02:20:26.220 --> 02:20:27.420]
So I'm wondering if she's still around.

[02:20:27.980 --> 02:20:28.340]
Depends.

[02:20:32.180 --> 02:20:32.860]
That's the right one.

[02:20:33.540 --> 02:20:34.060]
It's not?

[02:20:34.340 --> 02:20:34.940]
No, the other one.

[02:20:35.720 --> 02:20:36.520]
Oh, this is...

[02:20:36.520 --> 02:20:36.760]
It's like the low it.

[02:20:37.480 --> 02:20:38.860]
We launched it less than 10 days.

[02:20:38.860 --> 02:20:39.420]
That's not even that easy.

[02:20:39.420 --> 02:20:41.180]
We're going to be servers, storage, databases.

[02:20:41.780 --> 02:20:44.240]
We need to be wireless ready in six months' time.

[02:20:44.240 --> 02:20:44.860]
No, that's fine.

[02:20:44.960 --> 02:20:45.620]
It's on board.

[02:20:46.060 --> 02:20:47.720]
Maybe it's June Allison for depends.

[02:20:48.100 --> 02:20:48.120]
That's true.

[02:20:48.440 --> 02:20:49.800]
In fact, I don't even think it's in here.

[02:20:49.940 --> 02:20:51.000]
I think it's...

[02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:51.660]
Oh, no.

[02:20:52.160 --> 02:20:52.420]
Huh?

[02:20:54.420 --> 02:20:54.820]
Hi.

[02:20:55.140 --> 02:20:56.060]
I'm June Allison.

[02:20:56.740 --> 02:20:59.100]
Notice you haven't seen me in movies for a long time.

[02:20:59.540 --> 02:21:01.620]
That's because I always wet my pants.

[02:21:02.360 --> 02:21:05.680]
Remember my love scene with Jimmy Stewart and that money strat and fixer?

[02:21:05.800 --> 02:21:06.820]
No, I was soaked.

[02:21:07.640 --> 02:21:08.580]
Do you know Gene Kelly's face?

[02:21:08.580 --> 02:21:09.360]
Okay, that's not for that.

[02:21:10.800 --> 02:21:12.360]
We'll have to find out if she's still alive.

[02:21:12.360 --> 02:21:13.040]
Look it up, Carlos.

[02:21:13.200 --> 02:21:16.120]
There's something to do in between putting down these 50,000 movie titles for the most

[02:21:16.120 --> 02:21:16.660]
erotic movie.

[02:21:16.940 --> 02:21:17.980]
So Henry and June, you say no?

[02:21:18.680 --> 02:21:19.960]
No, let's put it on there anyway.

[02:21:20.280 --> 02:21:22.160]
Just to humor these people.

[02:21:22.400 --> 02:21:24.660]
Listen, maybe they were extra horny when they saw it.

[02:21:24.720 --> 02:21:27.960]
Maybe it did the job for them at that particular moment on that given day.

[02:21:28.160 --> 02:21:28.260]
Okay.

[02:21:28.460 --> 02:21:29.320]
Uma Thurman, by the way.

[02:21:29.560 --> 02:21:30.260]
Uma Thurman.

[02:21:30.400 --> 02:21:31.600]
Is she related to Emma Sumak?

[02:21:32.600 --> 02:21:32.960]
I'll check.

[02:21:35.140 --> 02:21:35.960]
What is it again?

[02:21:36.400 --> 02:21:37.060]
Emma Thurman?

[02:21:37.340 --> 02:21:37.540]
Uma.

[02:21:38.200 --> 02:21:38.860]
Uma Thurman.

[02:21:39.060 --> 02:21:39.300]
Uma.

[02:21:39.900 --> 02:21:40.520]
Uga Buga.

[02:21:40.980 --> 02:21:46.380]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on EAT and T and Verizon Wireless Lime.

[02:21:46.520 --> 02:21:49.300]
We got Joe Rose for the Mad Dog at one and the Humper in the studio.

[02:21:49.720 --> 02:21:50.660]
Four of a hour.

[02:21:50.940 --> 02:21:54.360]
He's going to work up his sweat and work off like maybe 20, 30 calories anyway.

[02:21:54.520 --> 02:21:55.260]
Four Latter-day, oh hello.

[02:21:55.820 --> 02:21:57.020]
I think I got two choice.

[02:21:57.220 --> 02:21:57.280]
One.

[02:21:57.900 --> 02:21:58.180]
Okay.

[02:21:58.460 --> 02:21:59.360]
He was great adventure.

[02:22:00.680 --> 02:22:01.800]
It's the crazy guy again.

[02:22:01.900 --> 02:22:02.120]
You're right.

[02:22:02.280 --> 02:22:03.380]
Boy, he just out of control.

[02:22:04.320 --> 02:22:05.100]
The crazy guy.

[02:22:05.780 --> 02:22:06.460]
Yeah, okay.

[02:22:09.020 --> 02:22:09.900]
Here's Miami.

[02:22:09.900 --> 02:22:10.280]
Hello.

[02:22:10.540 --> 02:22:11.180]
Hey.

[02:22:11.420 --> 02:22:12.060]
Yes, sir.

[02:22:12.280 --> 02:22:12.800]
What's up?

[02:22:12.900 --> 02:22:13.320]
How you doing?

[02:22:13.580 --> 02:22:13.880]
Okay.

[02:22:13.940 --> 02:22:14.700]
I got a couple of movies.

[02:22:14.900 --> 02:22:17.280]
Wild Things with Matt Dillon.

[02:22:17.720 --> 02:22:18.100]
I'm there.

[02:22:18.140 --> 02:22:18.920]
Got it.

[02:22:18.920 --> 02:22:19.340]
Okay.

[02:22:20.140 --> 02:22:20.780]
Founder.

[02:22:20.780 --> 02:22:21.700]
Body double.

[02:22:22.320 --> 02:22:23.560]
Blinded a form of film.

[02:22:23.960 --> 02:22:24.480]
Got it too.

[02:22:25.560 --> 02:22:25.900]
Okay.

[02:22:26.560 --> 02:22:34.160]
There was one against all odds back in the 80s with Jeff Bridges and Rachel Ward.

[02:22:34.160 --> 02:22:39.680]
There was a scene there in Mexico and the, uh, and the, uh, by the, uh, tunes or whatever.

[02:22:40.680 --> 02:22:41.660]
They were like naked.

[02:22:42.440 --> 02:22:42.840]
Okay.

[02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:45.580]
And, uh, the lonely girl.

[02:22:47.680 --> 02:22:49.120]
Where I forgot her name.

[02:22:49.340 --> 02:22:51.200]
My, her name I think was Applephone or something?

[02:22:51.400 --> 02:22:52.160]
The splonchick.

[02:22:52.540 --> 02:22:53.120]
Apple Queen.

[02:22:53.820 --> 02:22:53.960]
Yes.

[02:22:55.260 --> 02:22:59.500]
And she, and they, there's a rape scene where they shovel holes in their, in her thing.

[02:23:00.720 --> 02:23:01.700]
The literally a hose.

[02:23:02.140 --> 02:23:03.640]
They showed a hose in her thing.

[02:23:03.880 --> 02:23:04.620]
Yeah, in her thing.

[02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:05.320]
Okay.

[02:23:05.420 --> 02:23:06.300]
Well, thanks very much.

[02:23:06.540 --> 02:23:07.480]
The low-literal area goes.

[02:23:07.840 --> 02:23:08.680]
Georgia hose in her thing.

[02:23:08.900 --> 02:23:09.080]
Yeah.

[02:23:12.440 --> 02:23:12.980]
I'm here, though.

[02:23:14.140 --> 02:23:15.800]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[02:23:16.040 --> 02:23:19.420]
So you got these now, uh, show girls against all odds in the lonely girl.

[02:23:19.740 --> 02:23:22.460]
As the list is not the 422,000.

[02:23:23.140 --> 02:23:23.780]
Good God.

[02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:27.440]
So once you put that, they make sure you run a lot of these movies.

[02:23:27.600 --> 02:23:31.680]
So once it comes to real time to put on the duct tape in a viscene, you've got a lot of good entertainment now.

[02:23:31.680 --> 02:23:31.960]
It's there.

[02:23:32.320 --> 02:23:32.720]
Supplies.

[02:23:34.920 --> 02:23:37.280]
Lots of good panic supplies.

[02:23:38.840 --> 02:23:39.840]
Well, who hell is this guy?

[02:23:40.180 --> 02:23:42.640]
I'm not case standing out in the goddamn snow.

[02:23:42.720 --> 02:23:43.460]
That was meat in the middle.

[02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:46.840]
But you appreciate him all over again when you see him in his, like, white, white, white, white, white, white.

[02:23:46.840 --> 02:23:47.720]
Oh, the naked cowboy.

[02:23:47.880 --> 02:23:48.680]
Yeah, the naked cowboy.

[02:23:49.260 --> 02:23:52.660]
Every five minutes, he got him on the internet, uh, on the TV.

[02:23:53.000 --> 02:23:54.460]
And what, and what's his story?

[02:23:54.660 --> 02:23:55.620]
What's the ugly tattoos?

[02:23:56.060 --> 02:24:00.060]
He plays the guitar in his underwear, you know, cowboy boots and a cowboy hat.

[02:24:00.060 --> 02:24:00.960]
And he's the naked cowboy.

[02:24:00.960 --> 02:24:02.000]
He's famous, don't you know?

[02:24:02.120 --> 02:24:03.080]
He plays with it in his underwear.

[02:24:03.260 --> 02:24:04.300]
Well, that's pretty original.

[02:24:05.460 --> 02:24:06.500]
And there's Geneimo.

[02:24:06.540 --> 02:24:08.180]
She's getting blown all over the goddamn place.

[02:24:08.300 --> 02:24:09.020]
Nice going, Geneimo.

[02:24:09.120 --> 02:24:09.360]
We're lucky.

[02:24:09.480 --> 02:24:11.580]
Maybe they'll blow you away with your silly ass crap on CNN.

[02:24:12.060 --> 02:24:12.840]
Certainly not news.

[02:24:12.960 --> 02:24:13.760]
And they're proven it today.

[02:24:15.380 --> 02:24:16.620]
51 for nine and a half weeks.

[02:24:16.840 --> 02:24:17.920]
46 for body heat.

[02:24:18.080 --> 02:24:19.000]
22 blue lagoon.

[02:24:19.100 --> 02:24:19.640]
Basic instinct.

[02:24:19.920 --> 02:24:20.240]
18.

[02:24:21.100 --> 02:24:23.240]
Last time when Paris was supposed to be off the list.

[02:24:25.400 --> 02:24:25.800]
Carlos.

[02:24:25.800 --> 02:24:30.460]
I said Eric and he built with the telling him to take that off the list.

[02:24:30.860 --> 02:24:33.220]
Urgent, urgent, urgent, get that off it.

[02:24:33.260 --> 02:24:34.060]
It was x rated.

[02:24:34.580 --> 02:24:35.780]
Get that thing off.

[02:24:36.440 --> 02:24:37.000]
Or not.

[02:24:37.120 --> 02:24:37.580]
I don't really care.

[02:24:37.960 --> 02:24:40.760]
Unfateful 14 while working 14 fatal attraction 13.

[02:24:41.020 --> 02:24:41.820]
Wild things.

[02:24:42.540 --> 02:24:42.820]
11.

[02:24:43.160 --> 02:24:44.840]
Matt Damon was in with the wild thing.

[02:24:45.620 --> 02:24:46.440]
I don't know if he was in it.

[02:24:46.840 --> 02:24:47.360]
He bothers me.

[02:24:47.420 --> 02:24:48.280]
That's what the guy just said.

[02:24:48.400 --> 02:24:51.980]
Only moments ago if you would have been paying close attention instead of watching reruns of Kathy Lee.

[02:24:52.700 --> 02:24:53.280]
Kathy Lee.

[02:24:54.320 --> 02:24:55.240]
And let's see.

[02:24:55.380 --> 02:24:55.920]
Wild things 11.

[02:24:56.320 --> 02:24:57.100]
Mulholland Drive 11.

[02:24:57.280 --> 02:24:58.520]
And monsters of balls.

[02:24:59.000 --> 02:24:59.540]
He's got 11.

[02:25:01.740 --> 02:25:02.640]
How do you like that?

[02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:04.840]
So basically still a two horse race.

[02:25:05.140 --> 02:25:06.720]
It's 11.56 at Q.A.M.

[02:25:07.920 --> 02:25:08.900]
I am.

[02:25:09.680 --> 02:25:11.580]
This is 20 or 5.6.

[02:25:12.020 --> 02:25:13.160]
Q.A.M.

[02:25:13.340 --> 02:25:14.520]
Where are it?

[02:25:14.640 --> 02:25:15.520]
It beat at 12.00.

[02:25:15.520 --> 02:25:17.840]
The one I heard on WQA.

[02:25:20.440 --> 02:25:22.220]
She don't win.

[02:25:23.700 --> 02:25:26.580]
When she played in the flesh.

[02:25:27.620 --> 02:25:29.680]
She plays school.

[02:25:31.440 --> 02:25:33.380]
And now she does his scratch.

[02:25:34.820 --> 02:25:37.200]
How about she's so hard.

[02:25:38.620 --> 02:25:40.660]
And so in the heart.

[02:25:42.760 --> 02:25:45.980]
Well, I get this thing.

[02:25:45.980 --> 02:25:52.520]
I'm not a bad guy.

[02:25:52.520 --> 02:25:53.500]
I'm not a bad guy.

[02:25:53.500 --> 02:25:53.500]

[02:25:53.500 --> 02:25:53.500]

[02:25:53.500 --> 02:25:53.500]

[02:25:53.500 --> 02:25:55.500]
I'm not a bad guy.

[02:25:55.700 --> 02:25:57.660]
I'm not a bad guy.

[02:25:57.660 --> 02:26:01.840]
I'm not a bad guy.

[02:26:04.620 --> 02:26:07.820]
I'm not a bad guy.

[02:26:13.740 --> 02:26:15.760]
I'm not a bad guy.

[02:26:16.760 --> 02:26:19.760]
Tramher.

[02:26:35.080 --> 02:26:37.100]
我不知道.

[02:26:37.100 --> 02:26:39.860]
She's a sticky fan of flair.

[02:26:50.500 --> 02:26:50.860]
I

[02:26:55.580 --> 02:26:55.940]
Sure

[02:26:55.940 --> 02:27:00.340]
Sure you do we believe you 202 at 560 WQM our big noon to to a two hour

[02:27:00.960 --> 02:27:04.960]
Whatever the hell it is we need some noon noon to one hours by the way tell vocal Brian okay, okay

[02:27:04.960 --> 02:27:09.460]
You'll be very limited limited supply most of them are suck bad by the way. I should mention him

[02:27:10.180 --> 02:27:14.000]
The guilty one is great in the way to ribs, but other than that the rest of them blow

[02:27:17.620 --> 02:27:20.680]
The Michael Jackson stuff I just you know, I can't deal with it

[02:27:20.680 --> 02:27:22.880]
He's not a touch with reality as if he's or any bulletin

[02:27:23.800 --> 02:27:28.200]
He's got a touch with reality his children are fantasy props and what he's doing is dangerous

[02:27:28.780 --> 02:27:30.120]
says the star

[02:27:31.220 --> 02:27:32.060]
verdict bad

[02:27:33.160 --> 02:27:36.000]
Sad mad and bad or the three of columns here

[02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:39.300]
Michael Jackson thinks he's showing his love for children by sleeping with him the same bed

[02:27:39.300 --> 02:27:42.180]
But this is a terrible act that could scar a child for life

[02:27:43.060 --> 02:27:47.380]
What he's doing with children is inherently dangerous and horribly wrong says J. Howell a

[02:27:47.380 --> 02:27:52.600]
Nationally known crime victims attorney from Jacksonville and the author of state and federal statutes concerning child abuse

[02:27:52.600 --> 02:27:58.900]
Jackson isn't breaking the law by climbing into bed with the child his owner somebody else's but it's just totally irresponsibly says

[02:27:59.600 --> 02:28:03.420]
What kind of responsible adult would allow his kids to sleep with a 44 year old man

[02:28:03.420 --> 02:28:06.840]
And what kind of normal responsible male adult would want to sleep and go with a child?

[02:28:06.960 --> 02:28:10.340]
I'd be surprised that child protection groups are not looking into this and by the way

[02:28:10.340 --> 02:28:11.860]
I'm sure they are there's you think they are

[02:28:13.680 --> 02:28:18.200]
Charming they're taking a peek in the way he says we all ought to be doing that. He says everybody ought to be sick with children

[02:28:21.220 --> 02:28:26.280]
So thank guy that we have Michael back to well, let's see here's one and this is cute forget your subway diet

[02:28:28.720 --> 02:28:29.120]

That's a bad. Well, frankly, Tommy had a beer haircut bad hair. Come before he was in a bad right here's one

[02:28:50.720 --> 02:28:53.780]
It's just how about the color of night with Bruce Willis. Oh, how come all these movies?

[02:28:53.780 --> 02:28:55.720]
The one who was talking about they heard me

[02:28:57.080 --> 02:29:03.560]
So we put it down there or not whatever color of night. Why not we got 50,000 of us why not why not just put every movie

[02:29:03.560 --> 02:29:09.360]

[02:29:10.740 --> 02:29:16.060]
Mickey got a bang out of it. Let's see color of night. There's a pool scene where a little Bruce makes an appearance

[02:29:16.060 --> 02:29:20.840]
I don't want to see I don't want to see. Oh, what was the movie I was talking about were Kevin Bacon?

[02:29:20.840 --> 02:29:25.480]

[02:29:26.700 --> 02:29:29.600]
Kevin hanging out what else happened besides that

[02:29:30.940 --> 02:29:35.720]
Now what what does this mean how about the mandates all right bit care to play it. What does that mean?

[02:29:36.620 --> 02:29:40.760]
They're talking about mandates sink. I don't know what that means. Okay, but I do like the McDonald's one

[02:29:40.760 --> 02:29:45.460]
Oh, that's great forget your subway diet. Here is a pussy. Love it all right

[02:40:44.120 --> 02:40:48.320]
Really boring movie if you'd ever stood next to him even though he may not be if you're a persuasion

[02:40:48.320 --> 02:40:50.720]

Phenomenal looking young man. He was though. Why did they do that? Why did every movie?

[02:40:55.160 --> 02:40:59.100]
It was in just about he had to be a freak what was that about you go haven't seen Donnie Brasco though

[02:40:59.100 --> 02:41:07.380]

It was different, but it wasn't bizarre and this is like a bizarre as bizarre when we

[02:45:38.720 --> 02:45:42.080]
We try to make some cash was he playing the duck? Yeah, thanks. Oh

[02:45:43.600 --> 02:45:48.060]
Here's Miami. Hello. Hello Neil. Yes, sir. How about the serial boys

[02:45:48.840 --> 02:45:56.000]
What is it? Zero like like nothing zero boys. See it all like like in reek a zero boys. Yeah

[02:45:56.360 --> 02:45:57.340]
What is that?

[02:45:57.700 --> 02:46:00.700]
That's a movie about this guy's like like this art

[02:46:02.080 --> 02:46:04.800]
I don't know I don't remember it too well, but it's pretty good though

[02:46:05.180 --> 02:46:06.900]
Was it erotic or just bizarre?

[02:46:07.220 --> 02:46:08.520]
Briss art. Okay

[02:46:09.440 --> 02:46:12.580]
That's the guy to have a sure God is back to where we were yesterday again

[02:46:12.580 --> 02:46:16.380]
I'll tell you what let's do the thing we did last Friday. What was it? Oh, that's right. There wasn't any pull

[02:46:17.160 --> 02:46:19.420]
Let's do that. Okay. It's easier

[02:46:21.880 --> 02:46:23.180]
God this crowd man

[02:46:23.180 --> 02:46:28.720]
The drugs must have shipped and I got over there too soon the real good stuff must have come out right after I left it did over the weekend

[02:46:28.720 --> 02:46:31.380]
I think so I think you just it hasn't reached you yet. Oh

[02:46:32.340 --> 02:46:37.400]
Talk to Tommy about he can probably hook you go outside and wait for the truck to roll in talk to Zoltan about it

[02:46:37.400 --> 02:46:43.740]
Where would he be working these days he can probably hook up five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T and

[02:46:43.740 --> 02:46:48.100]
Verizon wireless line. Joe Rosal be along a one-tay about how he feels sorry for guilty

[02:46:48.700 --> 02:46:53.880]
And how poor girl he's getting screwed over real bad on that morning show and how girl is whining to everybody in town

[02:46:54.380 --> 02:46:59.660]
What am I gonna do? Yeah about the bad ratings and stuff. Joe's gonna talk about that between one and three today

[02:47:00.700 --> 02:47:01.400]
When you think?

[02:47:02.260 --> 02:47:02.540]
Unsure

[02:47:03.080 --> 02:47:07.860]
Because he was girl he's mentor as I told you before the show to have forgotten all of that had vanished

[02:47:07.860 --> 02:47:09.820]
I guess maybe when I had the stroke it came back

[02:47:10.260 --> 02:47:11.020]
The fact that

[02:47:11.540 --> 02:47:12.940]
Joe Rosal was always guilty's

[02:47:12.940 --> 02:47:14.180]
Taking him under his wing

[02:47:14.180 --> 02:47:18.780]
And so when they used to have the first team and they were like three guys and it was always like two against one

[02:47:18.780 --> 02:47:23.200]
Which it easier is gonna be unanimous or two against one no matter how you how you slice it right

[02:47:23.200 --> 02:47:28.260]
It was always Joe Rosalind guilty against poor D4. I think that's what pushed D4 over the edge, you know what?

[02:47:28.600 --> 02:47:30.180]
I think that's why he did that deal with the Indians

[02:47:30.180 --> 02:47:34.260]
No, that's seriously let's blame Joe Rose for what you say. Oh right sure. Why not?

[02:47:34.720 --> 02:47:37.500]
You done it Joe you pushed poor D4 over the edge

[02:47:37.880 --> 02:47:42.540]
That's why I had to walk around with an ankle bracelet on all the time because of you because always sticking up for that

[02:47:42.540 --> 02:47:44.040]
Winnie Winpy guilty

[02:47:44.800 --> 02:47:48.480]
I think guilty's getting exactly way to serve as managed hence to be a real suck whole

[02:47:49.020 --> 02:47:50.640]
And doing a hell of a job of it by the way

[02:47:51.440 --> 02:47:52.760]
Here's Pembert Pines. Hello

[02:47:53.420 --> 02:47:57.360]

[02:48:09.480 --> 02:48:14.760]

Uh, I D I bought a vampire motorcycle

[02:49:16.280 --> 02:49:18.340]

The whole time here it is. I'm curious yellow and it's was a foreign movie was like a Swedish movie

[02:49:53.260 --> 02:49:56.600]
I guess yeah, because got a Swedish name so I guess it must be a Swedish movie

[02:49:57.940 --> 02:50:04.460]
Sexual fantasies very bold for 67. It's a theoretical take on such liberal precept as non-violence

[02:50:04.460 --> 02:50:10.320]
Ensure that in its time the picture drew flak from all quarters. That's kind of movie. We like right it a lot of flak

[02:50:10.320 --> 02:50:11.980]
I wonder for Bertha saying the theme

[02:55:05.500 --> 02:55:06.340]
Yes sir

[02:55:06.340 --> 02:55:07.640]
I got three

[02:55:08.660 --> 02:55:09.100]
Masked

[02:55:09.100 --> 02:55:12.100]
I could tell the truth and I did

[02:55:12.100 --> 02:55:13.020]
Uh huh

[02:55:13.020 --> 02:55:14.200]
That's a crazy guy again

[02:55:14.200 --> 02:55:14.420]
Yep

[02:55:15.400 --> 02:55:16.060]
Here's Hollywood

[02:55:16.060 --> 02:55:16.800]
Hello

[02:55:16.800 --> 02:55:18.660]
Hey what's your lovey baby

[02:55:20.300 --> 02:55:20.740]
Uh

[02:55:21.420 --> 02:55:22.240]
Miami hello

[02:55:22.720 --> 02:55:23.700]
Hey, how you doing

[02:55:23.700 --> 02:55:24.220]
Okay

[02:55:24.220 --> 02:55:25.560]
I got two for the four

[02:55:25.560 --> 02:55:26.720]
One uh what

[02:55:26.720 --> 02:55:28.200]
It was one with both Derek Tarr

[02:55:28.200 --> 02:55:29.100]
I think was Tarzan

[02:55:29.100 --> 02:55:30.320]
The she or her and Tarzan

[02:55:30.320 --> 02:55:30.900]
She was like

[02:55:30.900 --> 02:55:31.720]
He was Tarzan

[02:55:32.360 --> 02:55:32.980]
And then uh

[02:55:32.980 --> 02:55:34.040]
How about in Manic City

[02:55:34.040 --> 02:55:34.880]
There was one Susan

[02:55:34.880 --> 02:55:35.880]
Another Susan Sarandon

[02:55:36.680 --> 02:55:37.200]
On the

[02:55:37.200 --> 02:55:38.200]
The last city was

[02:55:38.200 --> 02:55:39.420]
Donnie Darko

[02:55:39.920 --> 02:55:40.280]
Yeah

[02:55:40.940 --> 02:55:42.100]
That's really bizarre movie

[02:55:42.100 --> 02:55:43.020]
All right, yeah you have a good one

[02:55:43.020 --> 02:55:45.000]
He'd back to Bizarre movies again okay

[02:55:45.900 --> 02:55:46.260]
Heartland

[02:55:47.740 --> 02:55:48.100]
Heartland

[02:55:48.940 --> 02:55:49.760]
Isn't that what he said

[02:55:51.180 --> 02:55:52.620]
What was the first one that he said

[02:55:52.620 --> 02:55:54.780]
I don't know it was bad so I put it out of my head

[02:55:54.780 --> 02:55:55.260]
Oh okay

[02:55:55.260 --> 02:55:56.000]
Cross them all out

[02:55:56.000 --> 02:55:57.300]
He's I think he's still doing bizarre

[02:55:58.100 --> 02:56:00.260]
Which I think this is the bizarre student one hour

[02:56:00.260 --> 02:56:01.260]
So must be bizarre right

[02:56:01.260 --> 02:56:02.240]
Three in a row

[02:56:02.240 --> 02:56:04.060]
Five six seven oh five sixty

[02:56:04.480 --> 02:56:05.400]
Pond five sixty

[02:56:05.400 --> 02:56:07.280]
The crazy guys are coming on glued

[02:56:07.280 --> 02:56:08.500]
He's becoming told that

[02:56:08.500 --> 02:56:09.760]
You know who else is going to be on glued

[02:56:10.440 --> 02:56:10.860]
Who's that

[02:56:10.860 --> 02:56:11.980]
Because it's already Tuesday

[02:56:11.980 --> 02:56:12.620]
Little Jerry

[02:56:12.620 --> 02:56:13.940]
You know with the squeal of the little writing

[02:56:13.940 --> 02:56:15.780]
Because he knows that you're not going to send me the facts

[02:56:16.900 --> 02:56:17.820]
Has he sent me any

[02:56:18.300 --> 02:56:18.920]
Probably not

[02:56:20.540 --> 02:56:21.520]
Got to be very frustrated

[02:56:21.520 --> 02:56:23.140]
In fact maybe a little chronic Jerry

[02:56:23.140 --> 02:56:24.380]
Maybe he's the crazy guy

[02:56:24.960 --> 02:56:26.040]
When you come right down to it

[02:56:26.040 --> 02:56:27.480]
Stop and think that would make a lot of sense

[02:56:27.480 --> 02:56:28.480]
Ever seen the two of them together

[02:56:28.480 --> 02:56:29.160]
No no

[02:56:31.900 --> 02:56:33.240]
Here's four lottery all hello

[02:56:33.240 --> 02:56:34.440]
Hello Neil

[02:56:34.440 --> 02:56:35.260]
Yes

[02:56:35.260 --> 02:56:37.880]
I've got two for you one on the bizarre side

[02:56:37.880 --> 02:56:39.060]
Kentucky Fried movie

[02:56:39.980 --> 02:56:42.640]
And on the erotic side the one that Madonna did

[02:56:43.100 --> 02:56:44.860]
Was it just the final love or

[02:56:44.860 --> 02:56:45.340]
So

[02:56:45.340 --> 02:56:45.720]
Let that

[02:56:46.360 --> 02:56:47.820]
Okay, thanks over two

[02:56:47.820 --> 02:56:49.980]
Why are they still doing bizarre

[02:56:49.980 --> 02:56:50.900]
Why are we doing that

[02:56:50.900 --> 02:56:52.160]
I don't know

[02:56:52.700 --> 02:56:54.040]
Because just to piss me off

[02:56:54.040 --> 02:56:55.860]
See if they can give me another stroke before one o'clock

[02:56:55.860 --> 02:56:57.020]
They're working on it

[02:56:57.560 --> 02:56:58.920]
Why we're not doing bizarre

[02:56:58.920 --> 02:56:59.460]
That was yesterday

[02:56:59.460 --> 02:57:00.740]
We have to draw the line

[02:57:00.740 --> 02:57:01.760]
We draw the line

[02:57:01.760 --> 02:57:02.380]
Do you understand

[02:57:03.660 --> 02:57:05.440]
Just like we draw the line at nine

[02:57:05.440 --> 02:57:07.380]
What does that under by the way is that in here

[02:57:08.260 --> 02:57:09.020]
Is that not

[02:57:09.760 --> 02:57:10.760]
I don't I don't know

[02:57:10.760 --> 02:57:13.420]
Now see tell me to run tell me to get with it okay

[02:57:13.420 --> 02:57:15.840]
He's got a great a greatest hits

[02:57:15.840 --> 02:57:16.360]
Diddy

[02:57:16.360 --> 02:57:18.700]
Well, I got a package downstairs so that maybe

[02:57:18.700 --> 02:57:20.540]
Because I went out there and checked my message during the break

[02:57:20.540 --> 02:57:23.460]
Yeah, and there's a package downstairs which means

[02:57:23.880 --> 02:57:24.240]
Either

[02:57:24.840 --> 02:57:27.340]
It's another one of those CDs either from him or somebody else

[02:57:27.340 --> 02:57:28.320]
Or maybe a more than one

[02:57:28.320 --> 02:57:31.240]
Or it's $10 million small bills from Ed McMahon

[02:57:32.180 --> 02:57:38.520]
Don't they bring a giant check and you'll discover the answer to which one of these two it was tomorrow morning at nine as to whether I'm here or not

[02:57:38.520 --> 02:57:39.460]
Follow what I'm saying

[02:57:39.460 --> 02:57:39.800]
Yeah

[02:57:41.260 --> 02:57:42.680]
Let's see if we can break this streak

[02:57:42.680 --> 02:57:43.900]
Want to give it a shot

[02:57:43.900 --> 02:57:45.140]
Here's the Fort Lauderdale

[02:57:45.140 --> 02:57:45.400]
Hello

[02:57:47.700 --> 02:57:48.580]
Fort Lauderdale

[02:57:49.620 --> 02:57:51.120]
As we go for four in a row

[02:57:51.120 --> 02:57:51.800]
All right

[02:57:51.800 --> 02:57:52.700]
And we succeeded

[02:57:52.700 --> 02:57:53.740]
All right

[02:57:56.220 --> 02:57:57.100]
Miami hello

[02:57:57.100 --> 02:57:57.800]
Hey Neil

[02:57:57.800 --> 02:57:58.560]
Yes sir

[02:57:58.560 --> 02:58:02.000]
I got a couple but they both might have been rated X when they came out

[02:58:02.000 --> 02:58:03.020]
Is that cowboy

[02:58:04.120 --> 02:58:04.920]
Uh X

[02:58:04.920 --> 02:58:06.640]
That was rated X in the beginning

[02:58:06.640 --> 02:58:07.660]
Yeah but it would lay

[02:58:07.660 --> 02:58:09.320]
That can be on air because it wasn't

[02:58:09.320 --> 02:58:11.460]
It was not rated X later on it was rerelease

[02:58:11.460 --> 02:58:12.820]
Right it was rerelease and it was

[02:58:12.820 --> 02:58:15.640]
Or I don't know if the time is cheap and I don't know what the deal was with that one

[02:58:15.640 --> 02:58:17.560]
Right I think it was rereleased without being X

[02:58:17.560 --> 02:58:20.060]
Maybe the other one is and I'm serious about the title

[02:58:20.060 --> 02:58:21.240]
I spit on your grave

[02:58:22.720 --> 02:58:24.020]
I spit on your grave

[02:58:24.020 --> 02:58:25.960]
Yeah that's a neurotic movie

[02:58:25.960 --> 02:58:27.360]
Rape and then revenge

[02:58:27.360 --> 02:58:28.920]
Exactly that's the one

[02:58:28.920 --> 02:58:29.860]
Okay thanks

[02:58:29.860 --> 02:58:31.900]
Maybe he's been listening to them all okay

[02:58:32.640 --> 02:58:35.000]
Maybe I'm not going to go with that when the guy got his penis cut off in the bathtub

[02:58:35.000 --> 02:58:36.060]
That that was really erotic

[02:58:36.060 --> 02:58:37.040]
And how about the rape scene

[02:58:37.040 --> 02:58:38.060]
Gang rape is funny

[02:58:38.060 --> 02:58:38.940]
See so I've heard

[02:58:39.460 --> 02:58:39.820]
Okay

[02:58:39.820 --> 02:58:41.100]
Well so we're not putting those out

[02:58:41.100 --> 02:58:42.400]
Midnight cowboy that I can put on there

[02:58:42.400 --> 02:58:43.480]
Because it was X in the very beginning

[02:58:43.480 --> 02:58:44.500]
And then later on they discovered

[02:58:44.500 --> 02:58:47.320]
That Dustin Hoffman aka Ratso was so ugly

[02:58:47.320 --> 02:58:49.100]
That there could nothing be nothing erotic about that

[02:58:49.540 --> 02:58:51.980]
Even though John Boyd was a hustler in etc and so on

[02:58:51.980 --> 02:58:53.600]
There was too much faggery in there

[02:58:54.340 --> 02:58:55.780]
I don't think that's the reason it was rated

[02:58:55.780 --> 02:58:58.540]
That's the erotic if it had faggery in it

[02:58:58.540 --> 02:58:59.600]
Oh that's a good point

[02:59:00.160 --> 02:59:02.280]
20 to 1 at 560 WQ

[02:59:02.280 --> 02:59:04.760]
Nobody said cruising with Al Pacino thank goodness

[02:59:04.760 --> 02:59:06.420]
The low point of his career

[02:59:07.420 --> 02:59:08.340]
I tell you one thing

[02:59:08.340 --> 02:59:10.300]
The low point of the beast weight

[02:59:10.300 --> 02:59:12.040]
Has been like last one was he in Friday

[02:59:12.040 --> 02:59:12.560]
Yes

[02:59:13.700 --> 02:59:16.020]
He's lost 51 pounds and balanced for life

[02:59:16.020 --> 02:59:17.580]
And I guarantee you I promise you

[02:59:17.580 --> 02:59:19.020]
That if we have to chain him to the wall

[02:59:19.020 --> 02:59:21.400]
If we have to do like our own liposuction

[02:59:21.400 --> 02:59:22.660]
With a with a with that

[02:59:23.080 --> 02:59:25.860]
The thing we got over there against the wall

[02:59:25.860 --> 02:59:27.700]
That what is it

[02:59:27.700 --> 02:59:28.380]
What do we got

[02:59:28.380 --> 02:59:30.660]
That big OJ thing that the cleaver

[02:59:30.660 --> 02:59:31.480]
The machete

[02:59:31.480 --> 02:59:32.480]
The machete

[02:59:32.480 --> 02:59:33.460]
Yeah we have to do that

[02:59:33.460 --> 02:59:34.140]
Take it to him

[02:59:34.140 --> 02:59:35.220]
He'll be under 200 pounds

[02:59:35.220 --> 02:59:36.620]
Balance for life is what he's doing

[02:59:36.620 --> 02:59:38.020]
And we can do the same for you

[02:59:38.020 --> 02:59:39.600]
See I tried telling Troy balance for life

[02:59:39.600 --> 02:59:41.180]
Don't put Jeff high on this thing

[02:59:41.180 --> 02:59:42.140]
Don't put fat boy on there

[02:59:42.140 --> 02:59:43.160]
Which he tried for a couple of weeks

[02:59:43.160 --> 02:59:43.740]
Then it worked

[02:59:43.740 --> 02:59:45.120]
Was it embarrassing as hell

[02:59:45.120 --> 02:59:45.840]
Of course

[02:59:46.820 --> 02:59:47.780]
Because he's hopeless

[02:59:47.780 --> 02:59:48.700]
We just written him off

[02:59:48.700 --> 02:59:50.620]
But for those of us who still have a chance

[02:59:50.620 --> 02:59:52.200]
Who still would like to stay alive

[02:59:52.200 --> 02:59:54.260]
Would like to be able to walk without assistance

[02:59:55.280 --> 02:59:56.400]
This is the answer for it

[02:59:56.400 --> 02:59:57.020]
Because it's simple

[02:59:57.020 --> 02:59:57.600]
It's easy

[02:59:57.600 --> 02:59:58.980]
And you know how difficult it is

[02:59:58.980 --> 02:59:59.840]
When you go in the supermarket

[02:59:59.840 --> 03:00:00.940]
What am I going to buy

[03:00:00.940 --> 03:00:01.640]
What can I get

[03:00:01.640 --> 03:00:03.160]
Now with balance for life

[03:00:03.160 --> 03:00:04.340]
There's no counting a calories

[03:00:04.340 --> 03:00:05.200]
No counting of anything

[03:00:05.200 --> 03:00:05.900]
No cooking

[03:00:05.900 --> 03:00:06.440]
No shopping

[03:00:06.440 --> 03:00:06.900]
No cleaning

[03:00:06.900 --> 03:00:07.360]
No worries

[03:00:07.360 --> 03:00:09.000]
You just pick up your little black sack

[03:00:09.000 --> 03:00:09.760]
Right outside

[03:00:09.760 --> 03:00:11.080]
You do a six o'clock every morning

[03:00:11.080 --> 03:00:13.000]
And there's all your food for the entire day

[03:00:13.000 --> 03:00:14.360]
The only choice you have to make

[03:00:14.360 --> 03:00:15.120]
Is that little menu

[03:00:15.120 --> 03:00:16.140]
They give you a choose between

[03:00:16.140 --> 03:00:17.980]
Two alternatives for each of the meals on

[03:00:17.980 --> 03:00:18.980]
Every day you're on a program

[03:00:18.980 --> 03:00:19.460]
And that's it

[03:00:19.460 --> 03:00:20.800]
And the food is delicious

[03:00:20.800 --> 03:00:22.200]
Three fresh gourmet meals

[03:00:22.200 --> 03:00:22.980]
Two delicious snacks

[03:00:22.980 --> 03:00:24.160]
Right in your black sack

[03:00:24.160 --> 03:00:25.240]
And that's all you need all day

[03:00:25.940 --> 03:00:27.900]
And the weight will just pour off your body

[03:00:27.900 --> 03:00:28.460]
You'll be full

[03:00:28.460 --> 03:00:30.380]
Because there's plenty of food to keep you going all day in there

[03:00:30.380 --> 03:00:32.320]
And it's all based on the zone diet

[03:00:32.320 --> 03:00:33.200]
Which is very effective

[03:00:33.200 --> 03:00:34.140]
And watches them

[03:00:34.140 --> 03:00:35.300]
Makes the weight

[03:00:35.300 --> 03:00:36.660]
Just melt off your body

[03:00:36.660 --> 03:00:38.280]
I'm getting tongue-tied just thinking about it

[03:00:38.280 --> 03:00:39.380]
So let balance for life

[03:00:40.740 --> 03:00:41.840]
And in better health

[03:00:41.840 --> 03:00:43.040]

I'm really getting tongue-tied

[03:00:48.240 --> 03:00:49.240]
Because I'm thinking about the beast

[03:00:49.240 --> 03:00:50.920]

This is 43560

[03:01:01.300 --> 03:01:03.080]
Way and way

[03:01:03.080 --> 03:01:04.320]
The Riddians

[03:01:04.320 --> 03:01:05.700]
Done as dirt

[03:01:05.700 --> 03:01:07.400]
And now

[03:01:07.400 --> 03:01:09.000]
It's time for

[03:01:09.000 --> 03:01:10.460]
Leave it to Ozzy

[03:01:10.460 --> 03:01:13.380]
Starring Barbara Billingsley as June Cleaver

[03:01:13.380 --> 03:01:15.560]
Hugh Beaumont as Ward Cleaver

[03:01:15.560 --> 03:01:18.480]
And the irrepressible Ozzy Osborne

[03:01:18.480 --> 03:01:19.880]
As the Oz

[03:01:20.480 --> 03:01:22.840]
Oh good morning Ozzy

[03:01:22.840 --> 03:01:24.700]
Oh, fuck you mom

[03:01:24.700 --> 03:01:25.940]
Oh dear

[03:01:26.480 --> 03:01:30.360]
I can see someone woke up on the wrong side of the van

[03:01:30.360 --> 03:01:32.320]
Oh, so funny, oh

[03:01:32.320 --> 03:01:34.860]
I can't believe it, I must be headhurt

[03:01:34.860 --> 03:01:36.860]
What the fuck is Sharon?

[03:01:37.700 --> 03:01:38.160]
Sharon!

[03:01:38.900 --> 03:01:39.620]
Who's Sharon?

[03:01:40.100 --> 03:01:42.180]
Is that one of your friends from school, dear?

[03:01:43.180 --> 03:01:43.940]
Yeah

[03:01:43.940 --> 03:01:45.380]
Good morning Ozzy

[03:01:45.380 --> 03:01:46.900]
What the fuck is that?

[03:01:47.140 --> 03:01:48.000]
Get out of my face

[03:01:48.660 --> 03:01:51.380]
Now Ozzy, that's no way to talk to your father

[03:01:52.300 --> 03:01:54.900]
Say son, what have you got planned for today?

[03:01:55.160 --> 03:01:57.020]
We may have got planned for today

[03:01:57.020 --> 03:01:57.220]
What?

[03:01:57.780 --> 03:02:00.160]
I don't know, it's just one of the Prince of Darkness

[03:02:00.160 --> 03:02:02.200]
Have to hand out a f***ing antenna

[03:02:02.740 --> 03:02:06.900]
I mean, I'm gonna go fight the head over the boss of the Harsk

[03:02:06.900 --> 03:02:08.040]
Oh, is that up?

[03:02:08.400 --> 03:02:10.400]
You have fun now, okay Ozzy?

[03:02:10.500 --> 03:02:11.900]
Yeah, yeah sure, one

[03:02:11.900 --> 03:02:13.180]
Go f*** yourself

[03:02:13.860 --> 03:02:16.340]
We hope you enjoyed this episode of

[03:02:16.340 --> 03:02:17.320]
We The Too Ozzy

[03:02:17.320 --> 03:02:20.580]
tune in next week when you hear Ozzy say

[03:02:20.580 --> 03:02:21.960]
f***ing out of here

[03:02:22.480 --> 03:02:22.960]
1236

[03:02:23.540 --> 03:02:25.880]
Excuse me, at 560 WQA

[03:02:25.880 --> 03:02:27.860]
Did I step on one of his, yeah

[03:02:27.860 --> 03:02:29.580]
Sorry about that Ozzy

[03:02:29.580 --> 03:02:30.780]
You might just kill it

[03:02:31.580 --> 03:02:32.720]
Or maybe the

[03:02:32.720 --> 03:02:34.340]
Brady Bunchel show up again

[03:02:34.340 --> 03:02:35.360]
Or Donnie and Marie

[03:02:35.360 --> 03:02:38.400]
Now, was that you and Allison or Florence Henderson?

[03:02:38.720 --> 03:02:39.060]
What's Florence?

[03:02:39.940 --> 03:02:40.800]
So what do we got?

[03:02:40.800 --> 03:02:43.240]
I want to give you the list of the ones that don't have any votes

[03:02:43.240 --> 03:02:44.680]
I mean, I don't have leases on top

[03:02:44.680 --> 03:02:45.800]
It's strictly a tourist race

[03:02:45.800 --> 03:02:47.600]
It's not the most bizarre anymore

[03:02:47.600 --> 03:02:48.380]
That was yesterday

[03:02:48.380 --> 03:02:49.740]
It's not which floor to business

[03:02:49.740 --> 03:02:51.000]
You miss most that went out of business

[03:02:51.000 --> 03:02:52.900]
It's not which president had hemorrhoids

[03:02:54.340 --> 03:02:57.220]
What was the most erotic, not ex-rated movie you've ever seen?

[03:02:57.460 --> 03:02:59.160]
9.567, body heat 58

[03:02:59.160 --> 03:03:01.020]
Everybody else, malpathed is including George

[03:03:01.020 --> 03:03:02.480]
But the ones that have zero

[03:03:02.480 --> 03:03:03.760]
This is interesting because

[03:03:03.760 --> 03:03:05.160]
Why do they do this?

[03:03:06.060 --> 03:03:06.840]
Out of sight

[03:03:06.840 --> 03:03:08.340]
Video-drome, sliver

[03:03:08.340 --> 03:03:09.820]
Against all odds

[03:03:09.820 --> 03:03:11.960]
Don't look now, dressed to kill Henry and June

[03:03:11.960 --> 03:03:13.980]
In the realm of the senses, no way out

[03:03:14.660 --> 03:03:15.480]
Showgirls, paradise

[03:03:15.480 --> 03:03:18.100]
The lone legal, the lover, color of night

[03:03:18.100 --> 03:03:20.640]
Crash, dark tide, I'm curious yellow

[03:03:22.520 --> 03:03:22.920]
Clute

[03:03:22.920 --> 03:03:24.460]
One million years BC

[03:03:24.460 --> 03:03:25.500]
Where did that come from?

[03:03:25.640 --> 03:03:26.320]
Did I put that down?

[03:03:26.460 --> 03:03:28.700]
That's the caveman movie that the guy was talking about

[03:03:28.700 --> 03:03:29.280]
What do you tell about that?

[03:03:29.320 --> 03:03:32.020]
Summer of Sam, tattoo, white castle and wildard heart

[03:03:32.020 --> 03:03:32.560]
All of these

[03:03:32.560 --> 03:03:34.460]
Like, uh, 20 of them at least

[03:03:34.460 --> 03:03:35.660]
Have the big

[03:03:35.660 --> 03:03:36.040]
Oh!

[03:03:36.200 --> 03:03:36.460]
Nothing

[03:03:37.840 --> 03:03:39.340]
I mean, I realize there's a long way to go

[03:03:39.340 --> 03:03:41.340]
To them our morning, but is not kind of shocking to you?

[03:03:41.420 --> 03:03:41.620]
No

[03:03:42.460 --> 03:03:43.960]
That they continue calling these in

[03:03:43.960 --> 03:03:44.800]
And this is the problem

[03:03:44.800 --> 03:03:46.260]
That's what happens when you want to call it

[03:03:46.260 --> 03:03:47.680]
15 or 20 or 30

[03:03:47.680 --> 03:03:48.820]
And say oh, by the way

[03:03:48.820 --> 03:03:50.400]
Four of more free yesterday's poll

[03:03:50.400 --> 03:03:51.920]
You didn't say that at the beginning

[03:03:51.920 --> 03:03:53.900]
Call up and name all of the movies

[03:03:53.900 --> 03:03:55.620]
That you can think of that have nudity

[03:03:55.620 --> 03:03:56.940]
Or where people touch each other

[03:03:56.940 --> 03:03:57.660]
Yeah, that's it

[03:03:57.660 --> 03:03:59.300]
Or where they thought about doing it

[03:03:59.300 --> 03:03:59.820]
Would have been good

[03:03:59.820 --> 03:04:00.800]
Or talked about it

[03:04:01.760 --> 03:04:02.840]
Here's Miami, hello

[03:04:04.780 --> 03:04:05.500]
I'm Goliol

[03:04:07.020 --> 03:04:07.580]
Okay

[03:04:07.580 --> 03:04:08.100]
Hello

[03:04:08.620 --> 03:04:09.220]
Yes, sir

[03:04:09.900 --> 03:04:10.740]
Is this me?

[03:04:11.040 --> 03:04:12.460]
It sounds just like you

[03:04:13.680 --> 03:04:14.240]
Yeah

[03:04:14.240 --> 03:04:14.920]
Hey, uh

[03:04:14.920 --> 03:04:17.020]
Look, that lies in COD

[03:04:17.860 --> 03:04:19.320]
Oh, James Spader again

[03:04:20.820 --> 03:04:22.420]
Come on, George

[03:04:22.420 --> 03:04:24.280]
Yes, he don't like James Spader

[03:04:24.280 --> 03:04:25.640]
But what was the ronic about that?

[03:04:25.720 --> 03:04:26.700]
Nothing erotic happened

[03:04:26.700 --> 03:04:29.580]
Well, if you're not a boy or an exhibition

[03:04:29.580 --> 03:04:31.560]
This hit my dot gets your lady

[03:04:31.560 --> 03:04:32.440]
That's right

[03:04:32.440 --> 03:04:34.200]
This guy's a boy or an exhibitionist

[03:04:34.200 --> 03:04:35.620]
Thank you very much for now

[03:04:35.620 --> 03:04:36.080]
You're welcome

[03:04:36.080 --> 03:04:37.120]
No, I've been anything to see

[03:04:37.120 --> 03:04:37.860]
Have a great day here

[03:04:37.860 --> 03:04:38.320]
I'm just gonna let you know

[03:04:38.320 --> 03:04:39.620]
Don't let George crap on your parade

[03:04:39.620 --> 03:04:41.140]
Okay, he does it all the time

[03:04:41.920 --> 03:04:43.220]
Sex lives in video tape

[03:04:43.220 --> 03:04:44.640]
He liked it, it cranked his chain

[03:04:44.640 --> 03:04:45.620]
Put it down

[03:04:45.620 --> 03:04:46.820]
Or put it down

[03:04:46.820 --> 03:04:47.800]
I'm not working with him

[03:04:47.800 --> 03:04:49.420]
But don't be knocking that guy

[03:04:49.420 --> 03:04:50.880]
Just because he happens to be desperate

[03:04:50.880 --> 03:04:52.280]
Maybe that'll think for James Spader

[03:04:52.280 --> 03:04:52.700]
I don't know

[03:04:52.700 --> 03:04:53.260]
He must

[03:04:54.280 --> 03:04:55.140]
Now, what was that movie

[03:04:55.140 --> 03:04:56.360]
I kept telling you about that

[03:04:56.360 --> 03:04:57.140]
And where I came

[03:04:57.140 --> 03:04:58.640]
Re-Kanu Reeves movie

[03:04:59.460 --> 03:05:00.620]
Also with James Spader

[03:05:00.620 --> 03:05:01.240]
What the hell was that?

[03:05:01.300 --> 03:05:02.080]
Was that the erotic?

[03:05:02.240 --> 03:05:02.760]
I don't think so

[03:05:04.280 --> 03:05:05.600]
I think they were doing each other

[03:05:05.600 --> 03:05:06.460]
What do you know that Kiano?

[03:05:06.460 --> 03:05:06.820]
He like

[03:05:06.820 --> 03:05:08.260]
He swings it in all direction

[03:05:09.960 --> 03:05:11.380]
Let's do a pint crash

[03:05:11.380 --> 03:05:11.740]
Hello

[03:05:13.200 --> 03:05:13.600]
Hello

[03:05:13.600 --> 03:05:14.440]
Yes sir

[03:05:14.440 --> 03:05:16.380]
No, glad to see you back in action buddy

[03:05:16.380 --> 03:05:17.420]
Thank you so much

[03:05:17.420 --> 03:05:18.200]
How about

[03:05:18.200 --> 03:05:18.860]
Dutututu

[03:05:18.860 --> 03:05:19.640]
Deliverance

[03:05:21.140 --> 03:05:22.040]
Yeah, how about it

[03:05:25.400 --> 03:05:26.320]
Nobody had that

[03:05:26.320 --> 03:05:27.800]
It was it was amusing the first time

[03:05:27.800 --> 03:05:28.800]
But this time was kind of like

[03:05:28.800 --> 03:05:29.980]
Look on the weak side

[03:05:29.980 --> 03:05:30.880]
Do you know what I'm saying?

[03:05:32.500 --> 03:05:33.780]
When you say it was just a little

[03:05:33.780 --> 03:05:34.420]
We- A little

[03:05:38.720 --> 03:05:40.040]
But it wasn't a hell of a movie

[03:05:40.040 --> 03:05:40.740]
I'll say that

[03:05:41.760 --> 03:05:42.960]
Back when Bert Reynolds wasn't

[03:05:42.960 --> 03:05:44.000]
We're in a stupid hair piece

[03:05:44.000 --> 03:05:45.560]
Was he wearing a hair piece in that movie

[03:05:45.560 --> 03:05:45.860]
Or not?

[03:05:46.020 --> 03:05:46.540]
I don't know

[03:05:46.540 --> 03:05:47.320]
It's hard to tell

[03:05:47.320 --> 03:05:47.860]
Let's ask

[03:05:47.860 --> 03:05:48.800]
An expert

[03:05:51.940 --> 03:05:53.280]
You mean an expert on hair pieces

[03:05:53.280 --> 03:05:54.840]
Right, somebody who would know

[03:05:57.360 --> 03:05:58.520]
I don't think he would know

[03:05:58.520 --> 03:05:59.740]
About other people's hair pieces

[03:05:59.740 --> 03:06:02.560]
I- I- I- I- I- I- I- Yes he- he don't want to tell

[03:06:02.560 --> 03:06:03.880]
I- I- I- I-

[03:06:03.880 --> 03:06:05.060]
Because you have Gator, doesn't that

[03:06:05.060 --> 03:06:06.980]
Well, in fact the information, okay, Mo

[03:06:06.980 --> 03:06:07.720]
That's the way he is

[03:06:07.720 --> 03:06:08.420]
He's a hard-ass

[03:06:08.420 --> 03:06:09.420]
Oh, by the way, don't forget

[03:06:09.420 --> 03:06:10.220]
Joe Roosevelt long ago

[03:06:10.220 --> 03:06:12.640]
Want to talk about how he's been protecting guilty all these years

[03:06:13.920 --> 03:06:14.740]
Here's Oakland Park

[03:06:14.740 --> 03:06:15.080]
Hello

[03:06:17.740 --> 03:06:18.460]
Oakland Park

[03:06:18.820 --> 03:06:20.000]
Yes, I love you, I do

[03:06:20.000 --> 03:06:20.720]
Okay

[03:06:20.720 --> 03:06:22.460]
Are you guys a mission a good one?

[03:06:22.800 --> 03:06:23.580]
Uh, Downs

[03:06:24.360 --> 03:06:25.020]
Got it

[03:06:25.020 --> 03:06:26.180]
Yes, got it

[03:06:26.180 --> 03:06:28.100]
We got it like a long time ago

[03:06:28.100 --> 03:06:29.040]
But you may not have been listening

[03:06:29.040 --> 03:06:30.500]
Which you're in C. George comes right back

[03:06:30.500 --> 03:06:31.200]
Sarcastic

[03:06:31.200 --> 03:06:32.620]
Yes, I think that was George's thing, man

[03:06:32.620 --> 03:06:33.400]
You probably were

[03:06:33.400 --> 03:06:33.620]
Yes

[03:06:33.620 --> 03:06:33.620]

[03:06:33.620 --> 03:06:35.040]
Yes, then at that time and you're entitled

[03:06:35.040 --> 03:06:36.120]
But we do have it on a list

[03:06:36.120 --> 03:06:37.200]
Okay, thanks a bunch

[03:06:37.200 --> 03:06:38.020]
Thank you

[03:06:38.020 --> 03:06:38.480]
See?

[03:06:38.760 --> 03:06:40.020]
You have to be sarcastic with this guy

[03:06:40.020 --> 03:06:41.420]
Now, what do they hate you like poison?

[03:06:41.520 --> 03:06:41.740]
Funny

[03:06:41.740 --> 03:06:42.880]
Nice to people like me

[03:06:42.880 --> 03:06:43.620]
Come on

[03:06:43.620 --> 03:06:45.020]
Be nice, don't be calling people

[03:06:45.020 --> 03:06:45.740]
Assholes

[03:06:45.740 --> 03:06:47.840]
And chopping them off and things like that

[03:06:47.840 --> 03:06:49.100]
Be nice to them

[03:06:49.100 --> 03:06:50.260]
Even that crazy guy

[03:06:50.260 --> 03:06:51.560]
Be nice to them a little bit

[03:06:51.560 --> 03:06:52.820]
You-asshole

[03:06:52.820 --> 03:06:53.900]
Got what he eyes?

[03:06:54.120 --> 03:06:54.760]
Be nice to him

[03:06:54.760 --> 03:06:56.680]
He might, uh, someday come in handy for you

[03:06:56.680 --> 03:06:58.080]
I can't wait to go over it

[03:06:58.080 --> 03:06:59.480]
And Gilbert be nice to go

[03:06:59.480 --> 03:07:01.700]
You know what? Let's have a big party in Owen Vitamon

[03:07:01.700 --> 03:07:03.960]
In fact, maybe Gilbert and the guy with the eyes

[03:07:03.960 --> 03:07:05.940]
And the guy with the fanny pack and come in hang out

[03:07:06.360 --> 03:07:08.220]
Outside with freaky carlos someday

[03:07:08.220 --> 03:07:08.860]
On the lobby

[03:07:08.860 --> 03:07:10.560]
Only if they bring Jack with the hands

[03:07:10.560 --> 03:07:13.140]
I think that's a match made in purgatory right there

[03:07:13.140 --> 03:07:14.920]
Or you're Jack with the hands that goofy guy

[03:07:14.920 --> 03:07:15.560]
That would be good

[03:07:16.040 --> 03:07:16.780]
All those people

[03:07:16.780 --> 03:07:18.360]
If you wonder why Nio doesn't do it

[03:07:18.360 --> 03:07:19.520]
With those personal appearances anywhere

[03:07:19.520 --> 03:07:21.000]
I think we just gave it like the first clue

[03:07:21.000 --> 03:07:22.000]
Okay, the first hint

[03:07:23.340 --> 03:07:24.200]
1251 at 56

[03:07:24.200 --> 03:07:25.380]
If you know what Tom Brady's got

[03:07:25.380 --> 03:07:25.880]
What?

[03:07:26.960 --> 03:07:28.620]
Besides all the other obvious things

[03:07:28.620 --> 03:07:29.720]
He's got a bald spot

[03:07:29.720 --> 03:07:32.800]
I had no idea

[03:07:32.800 --> 03:07:34.580]
Which goes to sure that nobody's perfect

[03:07:34.580 --> 03:07:36.120]
Even somebody is lovely as Tom Brady

[03:07:36.120 --> 03:07:38.360]
He's got a bald spot that's growing

[03:07:38.360 --> 03:07:39.960]
In fact, I wouldn't be surprised too very long

[03:07:39.960 --> 03:07:41.880]
He'll be going to see my good buddy Chuck Alphieri

[03:07:41.880 --> 03:07:44.020]
In fact, next time that I meet up with Tom Brady

[03:07:44.020 --> 03:07:45.760]
I'm gonna say, hey, Tommy is I pat him on the back

[03:07:45.760 --> 03:07:46.680]
Put my hand on his knee

[03:07:46.680 --> 03:07:48.480]
Tommy, I got some good advice for it

[03:07:48.480 --> 03:07:49.800]
Go see the best hair guy in the world

[03:07:49.800 --> 03:07:50.720]
Who make you look beautiful

[03:07:50.720 --> 03:07:51.920]
Even more than you already do

[03:07:51.920 --> 03:07:52.960]
Chuck Alphieri

[03:07:52.960 --> 03:07:55.280]
His natural hairline system is the best technology

[03:07:55.280 --> 03:07:55.960]
Go on anywhere

[03:07:55.960 --> 03:07:57.740]
Which is why it looks like the real thing

[03:07:57.740 --> 03:07:58.520]
The choice is yours

[03:07:58.920 --> 03:08:00.620]
You can have that Sam Dovelson look

[03:08:00.620 --> 03:08:01.780]
Or that Mohawar David had looked

[03:08:01.780 --> 03:08:02.760]
That silly ass look

[03:08:02.760 --> 03:08:04.340]
Where people are laughing their ass off at you

[03:08:04.340 --> 03:08:05.460]
Because it's so obvious

[03:08:05.460 --> 03:08:06.860]
It's like a dead animal tied in your head

[03:08:06.860 --> 03:08:07.660]
And it's not the real thing

[03:08:07.660 --> 03:08:09.480]
Or Charlie's natural hairline system

[03:08:09.480 --> 03:08:11.220]
That looks like the hair is growing right under your scalp

[03:08:11.220 --> 03:08:11.840]
That's the difference

[03:08:11.840 --> 03:08:12.560]
Simple as that

[03:08:12.560 --> 03:08:14.420]
And then they got the guys with the dangerous pills

[03:08:14.420 --> 03:08:16.120]
The guys don't want to drill holes in your head

[03:08:16.120 --> 03:08:17.460]
And the blood is dripping down your forehead

[03:08:17.460 --> 03:08:18.640]
Forget about those things

[03:08:18.640 --> 03:08:20.820]
Charlie gives that 38-year-old T-2

[03:08:20.820 --> 03:08:22.000]
He got nothing loose but the bald spot

[03:08:22.000 --> 03:08:24.340]
Because if after 30 days you don't love the way it looks

[03:08:24.340 --> 03:08:27.080]
And feels if you're not getting laid at least 10-15 times today

[03:08:27.080 --> 03:08:28.860]
Charlie gives you a full refund no questions

[03:08:28.860 --> 03:08:29.260]
Acts

[03:08:29.260 --> 03:08:30.860]
And be sure to mention the Arrogers

[03:08:30.860 --> 03:08:32.640]
You get extra 200 bucks off the regular price too

[03:08:32.640 --> 03:08:34.220]
When you call it a Charles Alphier Studios

[03:08:34.220 --> 03:08:36.020]
And get your hair back for once and for all

[03:08:36.020 --> 03:08:38.240]
So look better and younger than you ever thought you would again

[03:08:38.240 --> 03:08:40.680]
1-800-3-124-13

[03:08:40.680 --> 03:08:43.320]
1-800-3-124-13

[03:08:43.320 --> 03:08:46.200]
Or check them out on the web at CharlesAlphiery.com

[03:08:46.200 --> 03:08:47.620]
I'm a live and local

[03:08:47.620 --> 03:08:49.420]
This is 5-16

[03:08:49.940 --> 03:08:50.980]
The radio is all yours

[03:08:50.980 --> 03:08:53.240]
I'm a huge fan

[03:08:53.240 --> 03:08:54.500]
I like the Wii Wii

[03:08:54.500 --> 03:08:56.400]
Tonight on CBS

[03:08:56.400 --> 03:09:00.420]
There's a brand new CSI spin-off at really irrox

[03:09:00.420 --> 03:09:02.320]
CSI Baghdad

[03:09:02.320 --> 03:09:04.760]
TV's fuckiest forensic franchise

[03:09:04.760 --> 03:09:06.620]
Investigates the one homicide

[03:09:06.620 --> 03:09:09.400]
Nobody on Predator is going to care about

[03:09:09.400 --> 03:09:12.000]
So this must be the victim

[03:09:12.000 --> 03:09:12.360]
Yep

[03:09:12.920 --> 03:09:14.240]
Let's see a racking male

[03:09:14.240 --> 03:09:15.780]
Early 60s

[03:09:15.780 --> 03:09:17.040]
Big thick greasy mustache

[03:09:17.040 --> 03:09:19.900]
Wearing green military fatigues

[03:09:19.900 --> 03:09:21.940]
Yep he's dead all right

[03:09:21.940 --> 03:09:22.740]
Yep he's dead

[03:09:23.660 --> 03:09:24.100]
Okay

[03:09:25.820 --> 03:09:27.100]
You want to go wrap a cup of coffee?

[03:09:27.280 --> 03:09:28.360]
Yeah sure it's good on the grade

[03:09:29.540 --> 03:09:30.420]
CSI Baghdad

[03:09:30.420 --> 03:09:32.980]
Who brought out the world's most bearded dictator

[03:09:32.980 --> 03:09:35.360]
Who perpetrated this deadly act ever then

[03:09:35.360 --> 03:09:36.060]
Who

[03:09:36.660 --> 03:09:37.540]
Who cares

[03:09:38.000 --> 03:09:39.440]
Why don't you go and do fine?

[03:09:39.640 --> 03:09:40.780]
Who killed some of them?

[03:09:41.140 --> 03:09:41.580]
Yeah

[03:09:42.040 --> 03:09:44.820]
Yeah, uh-huh, we're gonna get right on that

[03:09:44.820 --> 03:09:47.100]
What am I going to tell his loved ones?

[03:09:47.640 --> 03:09:49.320]
No, the loved ones

[03:09:49.320 --> 03:09:52.820]
Oh that's good, that is funny, you're a funny guy

[03:09:52.820 --> 03:09:54.580]
Oh thank you

[03:09:54.580 --> 03:09:58.360]
That's tonight on a brand new episode of CSI Baghdad

[03:09:58.360 --> 03:10:00.380]
Right after no survivor irrox

[03:10:00.380 --> 03:10:01.780]
Only on CBS

[03:10:05.320 --> 03:10:07.540]
I'd have played this one more time to make me feel bad

[03:10:07.540 --> 03:10:10.340]
If you can, I'd like to throw a bomb a rag

[03:10:11.160 --> 03:10:14.500]
If the markets are a drama, bomb a rag

[03:10:14.500 --> 03:10:15.140]
Oh

[03:10:15.140 --> 03:10:18.820]
If the terrorists are frisky, Pakistan is looking

[03:10:18.820 --> 03:10:22.260]
Shifty, North Korea is too risky, bomb a rag

[03:10:23.080 --> 03:10:26.320]
If we have no allies with us, bomb a rag

[03:10:26.320 --> 03:10:27.120]
Okay

[03:10:27.120 --> 03:10:30.380]
If we think that someone's this, this bomb a rag

[03:10:31.040 --> 03:10:33.360]
So to hell with the inspections

[03:10:33.360 --> 03:10:35.280]
Let's look up for the elections

[03:10:35.280 --> 03:10:38.400]
Close your mind and take the righteous bomb a rag

[03:10:39.160 --> 03:10:42.420]
Fall in line and follow orders, bomb a rag

[03:10:43.300 --> 03:10:46.260]
For our right exceeds our borders, bomb a rag

[03:10:46.720 --> 03:10:47.080]
Unbelabel

[03:10:56.480 --> 03:10:58.020]
258-560 WQAM

[03:10:58.020 --> 03:10:58.420]
Ah

[03:10:59.080 --> 03:11:00.380]
Take a look at this pool baby

[03:11:00.380 --> 03:11:01.940]
What was the most erotic now?

[03:11:02.040 --> 03:11:03.300]
They found them in what the pool is today

[03:11:03.300 --> 03:11:04.460]
Are they still working on the design?

[03:11:04.480 --> 03:11:04.940]
You racerhead

[03:11:04.940 --> 03:11:08.500]
I think that's the winner

[03:11:08.500 --> 03:11:10.200]
Racerade didn't do as well as you thought yesterday

[03:11:10.200 --> 03:11:12.780]
No, a lot of people didn't see that movie and then that's a good thing

[03:11:13.220 --> 03:11:15.320]
Yeah, maybe that's excellent for the human race

[03:11:15.320 --> 03:11:17.100]
That's a good sign of why a lot of us are still here

[03:11:17.480 --> 03:11:19.900]
Is the fact that we did not see eraser head

[03:11:20.880 --> 03:11:23.440]
The most erotic movie not x-ray that you've ever seen

[03:11:24.400 --> 03:11:25.840]
9.5 weeks, 69

[03:11:27.080 --> 03:11:27.940]
Did I make that up?

[03:11:28.060 --> 03:11:29.620]
No, and you just look at that and what does it say?

[03:11:29.820 --> 03:11:30.120]
69

[03:11:31.260 --> 03:11:32.320]
Body heat 61

[03:11:33.140 --> 03:11:34.360]
Blue Lagoon 29

[03:11:35.620 --> 03:11:36.980]
Basic instinct 23

[03:11:36.980 --> 03:11:38.080]
Wild work at 19

[03:11:38.080 --> 03:11:39.720]
Wild things 19

[03:11:40.700 --> 03:11:41.900]
Monsters ball 16

[03:11:43.660 --> 03:11:44.300]
Unfaithful 16

[03:11:44.300 --> 03:11:45.820]
Fatal attraction 15

[03:11:45.820 --> 03:11:47.180]
Mulholland Drive only 13

[03:11:47.180 --> 03:11:49.120]
Now you have to see that again from the very beginning

[03:11:49.120 --> 03:11:49.680]
Yes, I did

[03:11:50.600 --> 03:11:53.060]
In fact, I'm sure because it was one of my movie channels

[03:11:53.060 --> 03:11:55.300]
If I go and check this schedule which I'll do in a minute

[03:11:55.300 --> 03:11:56.940]
Uh, it's probably going to be on again soon

[03:11:56.940 --> 03:11:58.400]
Because I didn't see it right from the very beginning

[03:12:00.180 --> 03:12:03.540]
I'll be around that I have my 50 keys to understanding what it's all about

[03:12:04.120 --> 03:12:05.240]
Maybe all the look at this

[03:12:05.240 --> 03:12:07.400]
The postman always rings twice 12 already

[03:12:08.340 --> 03:12:10.420]
And you were pooping that like what's that?

[03:12:11.460 --> 03:12:14.220]
Summer lovers 10 two moon junction 10 and the rest

[03:12:14.220 --> 03:12:16.720]
Kind of like in the George Catereray small potatoes

[03:12:17.780 --> 03:12:20.020]
So this was okay for me this worked out well not tomorrow

[03:12:20.020 --> 03:12:20.720]
What we're going to do?

[03:12:21.180 --> 03:12:25.320]
The 50 favorite dead actors through they will do the 50 favorite uh dead actresses

[03:12:25.320 --> 03:12:28.620]
Okay, and then Friday will do the 50 favorite talk show host

[03:12:28.620 --> 03:12:30.880]
Speaking of uh interesting people

[03:12:30.880 --> 03:12:33.060]
Joe Rose is coming along next to the mad dog

[03:12:33.060 --> 03:12:34.160]
We got Hank Olberg at three

[03:12:34.160 --> 03:12:36.320]
We got the Panther game on QAM

[03:12:36.320 --> 03:12:40.460]
Pantheon's at Canadians we got the UN game on Waxi and we're just all over the damn place

[03:12:40.460 --> 03:12:41.560]
Bye bye bye

[03:12:41.560 --> 03:12:43.820]
Then you'll watch your show on FI-C

[03:12:43.820 --> 03:12:46.160]
The only QAM Miami for Larnay

[03:12:46.160 --> 03:12:48.300]
So the types mocha thinks that this thought of you

[03:12:48.300 --> 03:12:49.440]
