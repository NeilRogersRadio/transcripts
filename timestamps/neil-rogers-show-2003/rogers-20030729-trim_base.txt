[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.580]

[00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:07.140]
Fills in at the floor. We got Marlon's on deck. By the way, oh, I forgot to talk to Pharrell about that. Damn it

[00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:13.120]
Don't let me forget on Thursday to bust his walls, okay? Okay, man. It's late scratch by the way. I beg your pardon

[00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:14.540]
Joe Rose

[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:20.120]
Mad dog is a scratch and Joe Rose is gonna have to fill in oh, right. Oh my god

[00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:25.600]
I don't understand that place. Does anybody ever work when they're supposed to? What kind of schedule is everybody there on?

[00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:27.300]
Huh

[00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.040]
Summer time. No, seriously. You think that everybody's getting like a busman's holiday their most on vacation again tomorrow

[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.480]
Here I am slave it over on my today got no sleep. I feel like a death boil over

[00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.420]
But I show up like the trooper that I am my couple a couple of days a week

[00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.500]
It's only two months in fact. It's less than two months. Nice going norm you jackass

[00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.960]
Now what was I just saying before you interrupted something very important? Marlon. Yeah, no about about

[00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:56.680]
Pharrell I got to bust his balls on Thursday because you know all this Marlon hype and the fact of the matter is there's seven

[00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.740]
What is it seven or eight games over now? Beena boy. I think they're eight

[00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:07.520]
I thought it was seven but it could be a bottom line is there only one game away from the wild card now the fillies are falling like a rock and

[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.960]
Arizona courses the other team that they had to beat out and they beat them last night and they get

[00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.160]
10,000 people there at P.P. Park to watch the red hot Marlon

[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.260]
You know, it's just the same old crap. It's never gonna change nobody freaking cares

[00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.240]
Oh, but it rained yesterday afternoon that it rained during the game. No, I

[00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.440]
Mean you talk about lame excuses man talk about a front-running phony town and they can't even do that

[00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:36.580]
On the weekend when they're given away crap then they have their 20 25,000 18,000 people and then during the week nights

[00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:37.920]
It's the same old garbage again

[00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.200]
10,000 people

[00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.900]
That's of course that is tripled most audience

[00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.800]
Absolutely never less and you know something. It's not that far off

[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.600]
I

[00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.520]
Hope that joke costellers not awake it because we like to a lot. Okay. He's one of the people in the building we like very much, but

[00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.540]
But those numbers man on the overnight show

[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.140]
Get the telescope baby. You can't find him. You can't find him. I'd have to have them search party. Can you believe it?

[00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:05.340]
I believe it now

[00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.780]
What do you think the reason is for that because overnight when you're the only live local show? Haven't I said this before yes?

[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.340]
When you the only oh, there's my retired guy WQ I am

[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:17.200]
Hello

[00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:20.160]
That's not him

[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.340]
Not called earlier online night. Oh, honey. No, that was no, that's not him

[00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.920]
He doesn't call him line 9 so you don't even know your chronic smister

[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.000]
Oh, that was a different one you better start learning your chronic smister because you sure don't know him

[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.460]
We're gonna put your ass over there with a guy named Bridgetender pretty soon

[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.060]
Line 9 is that Schwarzer guy that calls every day like him and faxes the one day. He's Chris one day

[00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.120]
He's sloy me one day. He's most you perfect. That's that guy now. This guy might be the retired guy

[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.180]
WQ I am

[00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.940]
Yes, sir, can you play it for all tapes please?

[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.600]
It's the other asshole. So anyway, can you play the for all tapes please?

[00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.900]
Good play the George tape go play with yourself Jackass

[00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.140]
So what was I just about to do before that? I was disappointed we haven't heard from the retired guy yet

[00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:07.120]
In fact, you know something maybe this guy is the retired guy for all we know good per right right could be

[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.480]
Okay, so forget about those numbers here's the uphole for today. Oh, not another pull

[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.180]
It sure might be a little bit and of course in honor of the stone being up here tomorrow

[00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.740]
The greatest rock performer or performers I put the essence parentheses there

[00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:31.440]
So now it could be one person or a group the greatest rock performers of all time and I got like four which are obvious

[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:37.840]
Okay, and then after that and I'm saying performers not necessarily the greatest music right see what I'm saying

[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.040]
No, I understand and in an effort to go along with that. I have a suggestion

[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:48.260]
Okay, well, let me do the first four before you start muscling in before you get a little bit overbearing is the retired guy on yet

[00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.740]
I don't think that's it. Oh, here's a call from Davy. Hello

[00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:57.820]
That's yeah, huh?

[00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.040]
The other guy well, let's see we had so far the

[00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:05.380]
Played a for all tapes. Please that asshole the tape guy and we got to this clumbal

[00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:12.420]
We don't have the retired guy yet. Maybe didn't know I was gonna be on today the greatest rock performers of all time Elvis the stones obviously

[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.140]
The Beatles or Steve Tyler

[00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.940]
See I could have put Erosmith, but who knows from Erosmith, right? I don't know everybody

[00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:26.760]
No, but I'm talking about performance against you're missing the per no man Erosmith everybody knows Erosmith

[00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:33.060]
Okay, okay, okay, you just don't like those lips. What are you talking about big fantasy V? No, you're not

[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.580]
You're like his daughter. No, I'll yeah, I'm not the hot for his daughter

[00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:44.340]
We have a crap about him. Now there's my first four now. Who you gonna end? I changed it to Erosmith by the way since you said performer

[00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.000]
Yeah, kiss

[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.180]
Kiss okay. Oh, you're not kiss they probably just did a holiday and express last night

[00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:56.220]
Now let's see who was that also gonna say oh not Wayne Newton, please

[00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:01.920]
No, see that's the reason I put rock performer because I know that some old fossil

[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:05.100]
But that's an after crap. You know the one I'm talking about he put on a good show

[00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:10.600]
I understand every word that he said where when he sang a song. He spoke to so oh god

[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:39.620]
Actually kind of sick and it was right I was nothing on night. Well, I had no idea what I was saying

[00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:43.920]
I'm as healthy as a horse, but I can't function on my cup of water sleep. I'm just I don't know

[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:48.000]
I think maybe I'm just getting nervous about my big trip coming up

[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.820]
You know my big their extended vacation coming up soon my 10 days or whatever it is by the way

[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:10.960]
You see I wouldn't put the beach boys on there because I

[00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:17.220]
Think I thought footage of one of their content. No, but it was almost never that many way Brian was busy with his teddy bear in bed

[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:18.400]
eating

[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:24.420]
Eating cheos and he never got out of bed so he almost never took with the group or at least for a long time

[00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:27.100]
And then they had like all these fill in people

[00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:34.300]
Plus did you ever hear Mike love sing live? I saw footage. That's as close as I am. I mean, I'm sorry

[00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:37.560]
I mean I love the beach boys don't get me wrong. They know Marvin Gaye, but I love the beach boys

[00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:38.700]

[00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:33.200]

So both of those are big turn off for me. Thirdly, he never said a funny thing in his life

[00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:27.520]
Ever I mean even say the cruise once said

[00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:32.540]
Which I thought was kind of a reason that's not as funny as that other track. It stuck in my head

[00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:36.000]
I mentioned what are they track one of the ones that you fire off it starts not saying

[00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:43.140]

[00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:46.900]
I know seriously all the world was there

[00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:50.880]
That was a guy in drag

[00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:57.660]
And who the hell is she to be calling anybody negative

[00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:02.000]
I beg your pardon are you starting with a darky shit?

[00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:04.520]
I didn't say I

[00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:14.840]
Know I did not did you dump that yeah, I didn't say it. Oh, I did not I purposely stuff right on the line between

[00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:18.420]
What I am the tea I can't believe you dump me that's your tongue to your

[00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:23.480]
You don't worry about what I touched my tongue to mr. Believe me. I don't want to know lately a lot

[00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:26.480]

[00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:29.660]
No, seriously, I mean you you dumped that yeah, I dumped it

[00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:32.620]
I wanted time jickered after right another column, but he of course is out of touch

[00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:14.280]

That's boka Brian Jr. That's the mexican love song. What do you mean boka Brian's son?

[00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:33.140]

And he's a he's a amateur guitar player are you are you serious? Are you sure?

[00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:44.140]
He lives in a Ted Kaczynski shack and on top of a mountain in north Georgia

[00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:50.660]
But he has electricity and he plays the electric guitar and he aspires to be a a comedy funny song kind of guy

[00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:51.380]
Just like daddy

[00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:57.760]
And that's one of his early attempts he needs to probably a great fit. How come I don't have that next because it's it's

[00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:02.660]
It's even it was an afterthought he gave it to me like on a on a coaster disc not even on a regular boka Brian disc

[00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:15.820]
Blurred out a lot of work. I got dumped already. It's not even 11 o'clock in the morning

Yeah, well during the break. I want you to listen to it. Go back. You're being paranoid about those drops

[00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:38.920]

[00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:42.920]

[00:16:55.640 --> 00:17:00.980]
Stuart woman proposes trust god license plate. This is so freaking American. So this depressing

[00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:08.260]
Stuart a 46 year old woman wants the legislature to approve a trust god license plate with a profits used for

[00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:09.760]
Christian purposes

[00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:11.560]
trust god

[00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:16.720]
News and Hilton aboard again Christian who attends Morningside Church in Port St. Lucille

[00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:21.780]
Said money collected from the sale of the plates we go to Christian radio stations and charities through her

[00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:26.420]
Non-profit organization the god connection. How about if we get some of the money for the

[00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:27.820]
God connection

[00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:33.020]
The plate if approved would sell for 25 bucks in addition to cost of vehicle registration

[00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:36.400]
I thought the license plate would be a wonderful way to raise ongoing funds for

[00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:41.700]
For more media for a god hilton said where beseeds with so much negative media

[00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:43.800]
Nice to get a positive message out

[00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:49.780]
Hilton of Stuart need driver license data from 15,000 Florida motorist dude want to buy the plate before the petition

[00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:53.500]
You go to legislature. She soliciting drivers by word of mouth and through her website

[00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:58.820]
But the ACL use is a state license plate is not the appropriate venue for real good

[00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:02.100]
We're not be good. How what if we got a neo god license plate? Yeah

[00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:05.940]
What we have to do we have that one over here on the back of the computer remember

[00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:07.300]
But I mean like a real one sure

[00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:10.320]
Sounds very self-aggrandizing the minute start the campaign

[00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:17.700]
It's is in March if federal appeals were ruled against several pro choice groups who contended that Florida's choose life license plate was unconstitutional

[00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:21.480]
That played approved the 1998 is generate more than a million bucks from sales

[00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:26.280]
Which of course that million bucks and buy a lot of guns to blow up abortion clinics and kill abortion doctors, right

[00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:28.620]

But also in his license tags so it gets his new tag he can't find a screw so he puts the tag on the inside of the back window

[00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:57.780]
Which ordinarily would be okay, but he's got dark tinted windows and you can't the Ken O see it right and so the cop stops

[00:19:57.780 --> 00:20:03.200]
I mean luckily for you we happen to be a big gigantic fan. I was in wall probably a bag

Elvis the stones

[00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:32.320]
By the way if you're big stones fan well if you're big stones fan you already got all of their hits

[00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:35.800]
Right, I got every album. Oh with this double CD set

[00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:39.320]
Are you making derogatory comments about the stone? Absolutely not. I love the stuff

[00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:41.800]
But 40 licks is just I mean it's got

[00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:47.280]
No, my 40 40 and they're all each one of them is like

[00:24:57.660 --> 00:24:59.360]
So could be the stones or could be

[00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:04.360]
And I don't see her name on her yet. I don't see porcelia

[00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:07.820]
It's bad enough that you were so disrespectful on the year the other day after she croaked

[00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:10.820]
Old gorilla post, but I mean to come on

[00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:16.080]
Let's have a little respect for a seal. Yeah, okay. All our Hispanic listen about there all three of them

[00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:18.060]
Well, Maddie Bell by the way if you give us that breakdown

[00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:23.060]
That should be interesting since he's so desperate to give us some stuff that fat boy didn't legally give us yesterday

[00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:27.260]
And don't call me anymore fat boy you tub. Oh god stop calling me

[00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:33.560]
But it would be nice to see the ethnic breakdown in this book, wouldn't it? We always get that from Eddie Bell

[00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:36.780]
See if we have any Julio's out there any niggas

[00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:43.640]
Jimmy Hendrix for the Pulse is Greg north Miami an excellent choice when you say sure

[00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:46.480]
In fact, I feel like I'm an apropel. He's right now

[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:48.840]
All he needs a big cloud of smoke

[00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:50.140]
Here you go

[00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:54.160]
And up here that certainly could be arranged. Let's see Johnny says

[00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:59.020]
Number one kiss the alive tour for example number two now here's interesting

[00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:00.660]
Huh

[00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:06.820]
David Lee Roth during the original van Halen they saw them at the Miami Highlight fronton kick ass as Johnny

[00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:11.740]
So we should say back here is Johnny we should say Van Halen yeah. Oh yeah, David Lee Roth. Oh

[00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:14.060]
Van Halen with David Lee Roth

[00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:18.920]
No, just say Van Halen now know what we're talking about all right. What's wrong with you, man

[00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:22.440]
Are you some kind of a communist Van Halen with semi-hagor? Didn't really count

[00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:24.340]
We're not counting that good part

[00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:27.100]
They'll know what we're talking about okay

[00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:33.320]
Van Halen if you want to just Van Halen quick quick complicating see I'm trying to make this simple

[00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:36.020]
We got a lot of simple people out there and you're trying to make it complicated

[00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:38.620]
All I can say to you is

[00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:46.080]
Okay, so let's get the we got already got kissed. Let's get Van Halen on there now

[00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:50.340]
Here's and we got a whole bunch for Bruce Springsteen get him on right away. Oh, although I hate him like poison

[00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:53.180]
See this isn't my this isn't my taste. I vote for whom I like

[00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:56.380]
In fact, I'm gonna cast my vote right now, okay

[00:26:57.060 --> 00:26:57.420]
Okay

[00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:03.260]
And it's not for arrow Smith as much as I love him. Don't surprise you tonight. Yeah, you did huh?

[00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:06.420]
The greatest rock performers of all time

[00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:10.360]
I just want to make sure that there are other votes that came up on here because otherwise it'll make it too obvious

[00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:13.080]
Would you vote for Elvis? No, I did not vote for else

[00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:16.900]
I voted for Wayne Newton myself. I voted for

[00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:21.500]
I was tough it was between her and

[00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:29.980]
I

[00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:33.820]
Guess we don't got time to wait for the whole thing to be between her and

[00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:41.400]
See when you pick when it starts out with the vocal. It's a lot quicker. So I voted for the stones you voted for

[00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:50.060]
Kiss kiss why was there that pause there because we're having a conversation about

[00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:53.120]
Queen I didn't know queen was up there about a queen

[00:27:53.860 --> 00:27:58.220]
Oh, we got to get queen on there Freddie and the mercury, huh? Let's get queen on there

[00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:02.320]
How could you leave out queen out of sight out of mind?

[00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:07.940]
That's not even a one that's Gary Glitter. I know it's Gary Glitter

[00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:09.780]
But he's busy looking at kitty porn now leaving alone

[00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:12.060]
So we got Bruce Springsteen on there

[00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:15.960]
Here's a very interesting facts that says

[00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:20.900]
George had an interesting see there it is again interesting conversation with the caller if they conclusion

[00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:22.740]
Yes, today show well. It's about time

[00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:27.280]
The caller was talking about the courtroom see Michael Corleone. I sure hope he brought the KY

[00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:29.300]
Well, they are Italian, you know

[00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:34.340]
They used olive oil the collar that that's right. He used to know his father in the olive oil business

[00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:41.580]
The caller's opinion was that Frankie didn't testify because he didn't want to embarrass the pentangeline name is being a rat

[00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:44.500]
And the presence of his brother all I can say to that is

[00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:51.640]
George's opinion as well as mine and just about everybody else for the brain was that Frankie climbed up because he didn't want his brother

[00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:53.380]
Wacked no no kidding

[00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:58.120]
This makes the most sense because of in chins or spoke no English no speaking English

[00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:01.180]
In fact the first thing he said when he got off the plane was

[00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:06.780]
And had no idea what the leeway was what was going on. So how could he be embarrassed?

[00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:10.880]
George feels the caller's opinion was valid. What do you think what what?

[00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:14.920]
I said he had a valid point, but I still I still stand by my original

[00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:22.040]
He said to a wimp, you know, said to wish he was she a little wimp. He did not have a valid point. He was an idiot. I disagreed. I disagree with you guys

[00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:27.940]
You know what we really don't give a flying crap. How do you like that? And you know what I did say crap there are almost something else

[00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:34.320]
Almost big go ahead. No, stay outside. I'll let it go this time. Oh, okay for all time say no

[00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:37.580]
No, what do you mean you disagree? What's there to disagree about that? That's what it was all about

[00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:43.280]
He looked at him and they had him so they had his brother and just his very presence there meant that if he testified

[00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:47.360]
That's the way it works. Don't you understand? Well the Kosovo Stras

[00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:50.420]
It's that's the first rule of Kosovo Stras is

[00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:53.520]
You've been reading too many stupid books man

[00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:55.640]
The thing you've learned it brings all over you nice time to leaks

[00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:58.920]
Exactly that's a very good book. I then read the book. The book is great

[00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:05.360]
You have to play all the godfather drop-ins for the next two and a half hours. What do you say?

[00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:06.020]
That's my honor

[00:30:06.020 --> 00:30:08.720]
I think your brain is going to stop

[00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:12.020]
Anyway, it goes on about Bruce Springsteen in about these 53 years old

[00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:16.560]
He plays for three hours in the Audi Audi and he's a performer high-energy. Okay, we got springsteen

[00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:19.780]
Here's another one. It says springsteen. They love Bruce Springsteen. I can't stand him

[00:30:19.780 --> 00:30:22.940]
But he is not about me. It's all about you for what? I don't like him either

[00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:27.320]
During many of the springs was a chronic factor, but it's okay

[00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:32.400]
He says I know you're not a big fan of his, but I'd like to suggest Bob Dylan for your pool. Okay

[00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:36.880]
I thought the best tour was Bob Dylan and the band in 1974

[00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:38.680]
Don't you agree?

[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.660]
I don't mind his music as long as he's not singing it

[00:30:44.660 --> 00:30:50.480]
Good point. Well, he doesn't say anyway. I mean is there anybody out there who including him who really believes that Bob Dylan can sing?

[00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:54.100]
No, no. No, he can't sing. He winds. He just makes scuttle noises

[00:30:57.280 --> 00:30:59.800]
Okay, look at this the pool is up. It's about time Eric

[00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:07.900]
Pulles up the greatest rock performer or performers of all time. Stone's for a kiss for Beatles 3 pink Floyd 3 Elvis 2

[00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:14.440]

French people piss me out

[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:47.000]
Axel Rose can put out two albums at once

[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:54.560]
Bruce Springsteen can release two at a time but only one artist can top that now releasing four albums all at once

[00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:56.140]
It's Bob Dylan

[00:33:56.140 --> 00:33:56.760]
Blue

[00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:07.740]
Yes, only Bob Dylan can put out 90 completely new songs at once because no one gets have up these songs or any good

[00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:14.800]
What's he singing about who knows some say the lyrics are about love and rejection

[00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:17.820]
I just say their page 52 of the New York telephone directory

90 great songs who knows but bio four and they're just 59 cents a pound and look for four more Dylan albums next month

[00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:38.840]
Other state of mind man. He's the rascal house of music. Maybe we'll mistake about it

[00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:42.340]
1102 at 560 WQM 59 votes on the poll pretty weak

[00:34:42.340 --> 00:34:46.220]
That you wouldn't want to know why because a lot of them are still waiting for their group right

[00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:48.240]

Listener George says the Beatles are my favorite all-time band but

[00:49:14.460 --> 00:49:17.740]
Comment not I see but again listener George you're confusing. I'm not saying

[00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:23.020]
Don't what's the best group you've ever seen live because a lot of people never saw concert right?

[00:49:23.020 --> 00:49:28.700]
Right I've seen a few in my time but then on TV it's not the same thing but whatever you get that idea

[00:49:28.700 --> 00:49:31.760]
It's as how many in your listening audience actually saw them on stage

[00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:39.000]
I have trouble voting for them based on vintage black and white Ed Sullivan show clips is the pull about who we think was best or we saw that was best

[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:43.580]
Who you think was best listener George think think think remember you read for Franklin think

[00:49:44.340 --> 00:49:49.320]

Now that's pretty amazing because Elvis

[00:52:13.800 --> 00:52:15.720]
Well, I guess it's a generational thing

[00:52:16.240 --> 00:52:20.940]
Because his big thing wasn't just his music, but and just his gyrating hips on Ed Sullivan

[00:52:21.500 --> 00:52:22.760]
But all his years in Vegas

[00:52:23.780 --> 00:52:25.700]
including when he parked up to gigantic

[00:52:26.520 --> 00:52:27.580]
Angus sign and was like

[00:52:27.580 --> 00:52:32.660]
Busting the buttons off those tight outfits. He was wearing yeah, but it was you know I'm talking about sequins

[00:52:32.660 --> 00:52:36.740]
The sequins off those white outfits were like popping all over the stage

[00:52:37.860 --> 00:52:40.820]
Too many cheese peaches and what was the other thing and the uh

[00:52:40.820 --> 00:52:42.900]

[00:52:49.700 --> 00:52:52.400]
Now be your boys not too fond of them unless they're nice ones

[00:52:54.040 --> 00:52:57.840]
Police are on the list. I still say that's the greatest song of all time

[00:52:59.060 --> 00:53:02.960]
Irving breath you take and you you would say uh, it's so commercial

[00:53:03.780 --> 00:53:08.540]
First 500 times I heard it. No, no, see that's not that's not the barometer is what did you hear it too many times?

[00:53:08.540 --> 00:53:12.260]
You know, I mean there are a lot of times that were played way too much. It's just fine

[00:53:12.260 --> 00:53:16.560]
I love the police. I had the greatest hits in my car and see he stepped on it. I was saying a lot of songs were played too much

[00:53:17.700 --> 00:53:21.060]
Like that. Yeah, but if you take it on the face of it that one still sucks

[00:53:21.060 --> 00:53:22.640]
What about the white stripes?

[00:53:23.860 --> 00:53:25.900]
Kakka okay, it says they make real

[00:53:27.840 --> 00:53:33.580]

[00:53:33.580 --> 00:53:39.500]
There reminds me of something that comes from rock school that aids the 70s absolute how about to appease the muskrat wearing DG in the morning

[00:53:39.500 --> 00:53:46.060]
They put pad boon on the list. Oh sure speaking of old how about fan out fats dominoes a great performer and Chuck Berry sure

[00:54:10.100 --> 00:54:11.280]
Right, how's he listening now?

[00:54:12.420 --> 00:54:16.880]
Maybe they don't allow it up there. You think maybe Tom Dachel is afraid that you know some of that

[00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:22.420]
Bush propaganda will seep in that somebody might read about Ann Coulter or miss Fudge some of the last stuff

[01:02:27.620 --> 01:02:31.380]
Being a boy's been doing a spectacular job in between Jelsons is on our website

[01:02:31.380 --> 01:02:34.280]
As long as I can stay away from the police in between arrests

[01:02:34.860 --> 01:02:38.860]
In fact, even got in when somebody mentioned the police before staying in the police. He got real nervous

[01:02:39.680 --> 01:02:44.140]
Let's see. It's a sincere in Canada. How about Russia? Did we put Russia on there? I thought we did we did

[01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:48.260]
Well, we were supposed to I read it off of there, but you know what Eric should be on there

[01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:54.340]
He's got nine votes just calm down boys and girls. It's already gotten nine votes. How about Metallica

[01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:56.820]
Right, what do you say what do you say?

[01:02:57.320 --> 01:02:57.680]
Indeed

[01:02:58.460 --> 01:03:03.780]
How about Motley crew? Okay, what's the concert amazing? How about Moby

[01:03:05.380 --> 01:03:09.660]

Talk about live performances to Morrison in Miami. Yeah, I don't whip it right out baby

[01:03:50.500 --> 01:03:54.800]
Well, what is wrong with us? Yeah, he stands out in the crowd. He sticks out in the crowd

[01:03:56.760 --> 01:03:59.940]
Way out but the rumor I hear is that he never actually did it

[01:03:59.940 --> 01:04:03.220]
He's related that he was guy. He never really whipped it up. It was his thumb. He still

[01:04:03.220 --> 01:04:04.800]
Yeah, it looked like a thumb

[01:04:05.240 --> 01:04:07.940]
It was a digit in my case little finger, but anyway

[01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:12.840]
Button mushroom. Oh, no seriously. That's what I heard that he never really did that but that they uh

[01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:17.680]
Based on the threat of it and he was simulating masturbation on stage and so they are busted his hands

[01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:20.940]

How freaking embarrassing is that?

[01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:04.020]
Exactly I like the beginning

[01:05:07.380 --> 01:05:13.700]
I tell you everybody in town is gonna be doing that all day long. You can't once you start. You can't stop can't stop

[01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:14.820]
Is that a

[01:05:14.820 --> 01:05:20.700]
I'm closer on this song by the way who needs the stones we can have a cedric crews

[01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:23.080]
I'm versus cedric's hardwick

[01:05:24.680 --> 01:05:29.060]
Want it? That's what they said he was a great actor by the cedric carbon

[01:05:30.380 --> 01:05:36.480]
That's before your time. I'm talking about the way I do I thought it was with the days baby the 40s the 50s the 60s

[01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:40.640]
Those are the days and now look what we got now man. Dreck we got Dreck

[01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:45.080]
I'll tell you one thing we got we got the beast. We're still keeping them right now. I'm gonna go back on what I said before

[01:05:45.080 --> 01:05:46.140]
I'm gonna give him a shot, okay

[01:05:47.460 --> 01:05:51.960]
Because you know because for real I made up all kinds of stories about him eating Tony Roma's ribs and

[01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:57.000]
Drink all these drinks. That was just bull crab. That'll be it's one thing to joke with almost anything else

[01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:02.580]
But when it comes to trying to keep a guy alive with a diet don't be sticking around with that. Okay, Scott

[01:06:04.620 --> 01:06:06.260]
See, I don't you know, I don't really have that many

[01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:12.080]
Drops from where we don't I'll take your children. I'll sell them to some Haitians. Okay

[01:06:12.080 --> 01:06:17.560]
Anyway, if you're trying to lose weight do what the beast is doing right now try balance for life because it's for very simple people

[01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:23.960]
It's a no-brainer. There's no cooking involved no shopping no cleaning no worries no calorie counting no carb counting no nothing

[01:06:23.960 --> 01:06:26.980]
All you do is you go to your door every morning by six o'clock at a.m

[01:06:26.980 --> 01:06:29.400]
And you reach out there and pick up your little black sack

[01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:35.060]
Everybody should have a little black sack and in your sack is all the food you need for the entire day three delicious gourmet meals

[01:06:35.060 --> 01:06:40.500]
Two delicious snacks are right in there. We're talking about in fact the beast tells us remember who's talking about this the other day

[01:06:40.500 --> 01:06:43.420]
That the food is good. It wasn't a past is better than ever

[01:06:43.420 --> 01:06:47.720]
It is gourmet for sure delicious and there's enough food in that sack to keep you full all day long

[01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:50.980]
So you don't have to worry about cravings and cheating and all that other stuff which makes you fail

This is the only company by the way it lets you choose between two choices for each meal every day

[01:06:55.140 --> 01:06:58.160]

How about little Richard somebody says but we're shooting a lot of faxes on this. I'm trying to like

[01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:25.500]
Make a mince here, okay?

[01:09:26.500 --> 01:09:29.520]
Well, that one's not gonna do because it's got that real seven minutes long though

[01:09:30.300 --> 01:09:32.720]
How about this one? This is also seven minutes

[01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:40.120]
And on this particular album cover he's looking right at

[01:09:40.120 --> 01:09:43.000]
You know that it would be our true night

[01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:46.700]
You know that I would be a liar

[01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:50.040]
If I was to say to you

[01:09:51.640 --> 01:09:53.800]
Girl we couldn't get much higher

[01:09:54.340 --> 01:09:59.660]
Is that a great day? What I mean? I don't know so there you go the doors of Cecil Cruz or your tough choices today

[01:10:00.280 --> 01:10:02.080]
Life is full of tough choices, you know

[01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:09.660]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 how is Cecil doing Cecil's moving in the third place, you see that?

[01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:12.560]
You have little faith yeah, what

[01:10:13.460 --> 01:10:18.920]
See you being as negative as you are you would say that those are crank votes and let's say you're probably right

[01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:24.060]
Uh stones 43 Beatles 35 Cecil crab I mean see you know Cecil Cruz

[01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:26.860]
Cecil Cruz 24 20 5th row

And other damn things changed on me again

[01:10:31.140 --> 01:10:34.500]
So what happened all of that Cecil's up to 26 26

[01:10:35.400 --> 01:10:39.500]
Uh now do you say that you're 20 say you don't say the yes on the end of you 26

[01:10:40.180 --> 01:10:42.840]
You do say it. I'm seeing how can I'm getting into my Italian again

[01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:48.500]
I hate that because Italian and Spanish there's so many words that are so similar and I start to there must be um

[01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:56.020]
You know like we have Spanish like when people write Spanish in English sure there must be like something for like Spanish and Italian you know I mean

[01:10:57.280 --> 01:11:01.360]
Because the countries aren't that far apart and uh there must be people that like have hung out

[01:11:01.360 --> 01:11:03.320]
Have maybe like a little Italian in them

[01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:07.200]
Sure, there must have been a time when the languages were almost identical since they started out the same

[01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:10.680]
So there must be like some kind of hybrid. I don't know if there's a name for you. Yeah

[01:11:10.680 --> 01:11:14.180]
Anyway, Kisses got 20 springstein 19 the who 18

[01:11:15.080 --> 01:11:19.040]
Led's that now how could Bruce Springsteen be ahead of the whole that's right. For God. He does always long concerns

[01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:19.500]
He's great

[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:26.680]
No, that's what everybody says. He's another uh the who 18 led Zeppelin 17 pink Floyd 17 11 is 15

[01:11:26.680 --> 01:11:30.360]
Thank God the king is starting to move up a little bit. Well, he's a little slow now

[01:11:30.780 --> 01:11:34.000]
Kind of like I'mus Jimmy Hendrix 12 rush 11

[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:38.520]
Elton John 10 Bob Dylan 9 and from there. It's really small taters

Kind of take oh and you know what there's no paper in my facemaking you know the facemaking at one moment, please

[01:11:55.040 --> 01:12:03.160]

Do I like this or what a lot?

[01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:13.600]
You know, I might actually have changed my vote that would be bad

[01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:18.500]
But let me start at this I've been wanting to change my vote

[01:12:18.500 --> 01:12:23.340]
Wouldn't it be like UnCanadian for me to do that now that this big relief concert is coming here tomorrow on the stones

[01:12:23.340 --> 01:12:25.860]
They're all this hoopla don't be like UnCanadian ain't that Canadian?

[01:12:26.860 --> 01:12:27.180]
But I

[01:12:40.140 --> 01:12:40.620]
I

[01:12:40.620 --> 01:12:40.620]

[01:12:40.620 --> 01:12:40.920]
Is it

[01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:50.300]
Who told you that somebody it's about oral sex yeah, so what's wrong with that ask your mom twice is nice

[01:12:51.960 --> 01:12:54.420]
Oh, no, I'm not asking my mom for it. No, she's

[01:12:57.200 --> 01:13:00.180]
Maybe you'd like to ask my mom can her teeth come out

[01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:05.660]
Maybe build Tanner knows something about remember that the character on his show on my 100 mama lap

[01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:07.580]
Pinka remember that

[01:13:08.100 --> 01:13:13.380]
And you know I was thinking about that the other you know how long ago he was doing that I mean he's has been on ear Miami for old many years

[01:13:13.380 --> 01:13:19.460]
Maybe 15 anyway, no actually I bet it's more than 20 yeah, no, I made maybe 15

[01:13:21.100 --> 01:13:27.140]
And he was doing that stuff 20 years ago right with that whole family you know and he was with at the

[01:13:27.140 --> 01:13:31.220]
Holy old crowd he was appealing to all the young hula's but at mama lap, pingusta anyway

[01:13:31.900 --> 01:13:40.500]

Not stuff that I necessarily would watch but right I can see in turn or was a great show just absolutely correct

[01:13:52.860 --> 01:13:55.880]
You're right they would they would play in the wreck bar down in

[01:13:56.640 --> 01:13:58.260]
Years ago and then

[01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:03.220]
Thanks that we used to do concerts at highlight and those were great concerts also

[01:14:03.220 --> 01:14:08.620]
And then I had the misfortune of taking my daughter to a Madonna concert and I hate Madonna. Yeah

[01:14:08.620 --> 01:14:13.640]
But it was an unbelievable concert. I mean that woman really put on a show

[01:14:13.640 --> 01:14:20.020]
So and then the last thing is if you ever seen Tina Turner and Cecilia Ruiz in the same room together

[01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:23.620]

Hey man same person man

[01:14:25.140 --> 01:14:27.780]
Yeah, I love you have a great day

[01:14:28.440 --> 01:14:30.460]

Want to put Tore Amos sure you do good concert she does she plays the piano and sings at the same time a la you know

[01:15:02.260 --> 01:15:04.620]
I can't believe it and she's a Toledo

[01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:11.120]
Okay, and T-Rex and Jethro Dull we're not putting dark madam canyons on her unless you know something to make up

[01:15:11.940 --> 01:15:13.920]
What they didn't make it up getting

[01:15:15.660 --> 01:15:20.440]
God just because we're old and stuffy and out of it. Are we just to play that?

[01:15:22.140 --> 01:15:26.740]

Everyone

[01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:35.340]
We want to apologize

[01:15:38.980 --> 01:15:42.320]
Even though he's alive and he's in France with sharing compassion

[01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:47.420]
I don't know about you other passions viewers out there

[01:15:47.420 --> 01:15:53.660]
But you're getting a little bit impatient with the story line now wouldn't it be nice finally before she croaks with the baby down there in the pit

[01:15:53.660 --> 01:15:58.220]
I mean, it's not bad enough that Julian and the and what's your name their tabitha are in hell or whatever

[01:15:58.960 --> 01:16:05.060]
Whatever Rebecca and it's not bad enough that we can't get Ethan to find the open at God damn Dury he's dropping the keys in the soap

[01:16:05.660 --> 01:16:10.100]
But good god almighty somebody finds Sheridan down there and that pit before it's too late

[01:16:11.320 --> 01:16:13.800]
You have no idea what I'm talking about nope good

[01:16:14.360 --> 01:16:19.820]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 if you had any idea what fun you're missing out on you just

[01:16:19.820 --> 01:16:22.320]
I've heard a bit of it the other day fun

[01:16:22.940 --> 01:16:25.280]
tons of fun. It's a panic and they just

[01:16:25.780 --> 01:16:32.360]
Tantalize you and tease you and and drag you along in a story line never the story lies never ever come to an end

[01:16:32.360 --> 01:16:36.900]
It just goes on and on and on and they do it intentionally just to terrorize you

[01:16:38.260 --> 01:16:39.020]
WQA and hello

[01:16:39.540 --> 01:16:41.700]
Yeah, I'd like to speak to you speaking

[01:16:43.580 --> 01:16:46.520]
How about Ozzy Osborne how about him there you go

[01:16:47.940 --> 01:16:53.360]
You got it man, okay, thanks. Thanks. How can we leave Ozzy off we're we're slipping. We just

[01:16:54.020 --> 01:16:59.980]
Were we up to them? I mean we all respect that Don was slipping, you know, I had my chance if you'd come on here with a complete list

[01:16:59.980 --> 01:17:00.980]
Then what would they do?

[01:17:02.760 --> 01:17:07.040]
Then they bitch about it. They say well, what about now? You're right. No, I don't want to have a complete list

[01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:10.180]
But I mean some of the real obvious ones like the doors and Ozzy Osborne

[01:17:10.600 --> 01:17:15.960]
Who by the way never did bite the head off the bat that sets bull crap? Did you read about with that? No

[01:17:15.960 --> 01:17:20.060]
Well, I'm not gonna go in it. No, that was bull crap. He never really did that. I thought he did

[01:17:20.060 --> 01:17:26.240]
Well, I thought if I'm a mistake and I heard him telling the story and people were throwing like fake stuff

[01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:32.300]
In the thing and somebody threw a real one and he grabbed it before he knew it was real right?

[01:17:32.300 --> 01:17:38.860]
I did it. Well, exactly. Okay, he bit into it, but it was like that and they wasn't it was not an intentional act like part of a show right right now

[01:17:38.860 --> 01:17:43.440]
The pigeon was on purpose not during the show, but during that meeting he ate Walter pigeon on stage

[01:17:47.500 --> 01:17:55.800]
How about frankin for Lauderdale who's gonna have a great sense of humor says how about the traveling Wilbur is oh my god, Frank

[01:17:56.480 --> 01:18:00.480]
You think Frank is serious? I don't know the traveling Wilbur

[01:18:02.520 --> 01:18:06.680]
Roy Orbison who else was in the traveling Wilbur is Tom Petty Bob Dylan

[01:18:07.680 --> 01:18:10.520]
was mining then one more George Harrison

[01:18:11.320 --> 01:18:12.040]
George Harrison

[01:18:14.120 --> 01:18:19.580]
He's not traveling no more. I'll tell you that why look put him on there just because he took the time to send us the facts

[01:18:19.580 --> 01:18:21.680]
Okay, that's a kind of good mood. I mean now that I'm almost awake

[01:18:22.660 --> 01:18:25.800]
Here you go. Here's the facts from Keith and Boko who says craft work

[01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:29.360]
Put on the best show I've ever seen their number one choice for me, but since they're an

[01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:34.340]
Electronic band from Germany. I'm probably going first in the vote for him craft work good music by the way I like their stuff

[01:18:34.340 --> 01:18:36.860]
Been listening since 72 Gary Newman

[01:18:37.460 --> 01:18:42.660]
The guy who's famous for his most awful song cars used to put on one hell of a show back in eighties and

[01:18:43.260 --> 01:18:45.120]
It says Tori Amos. We just got that

[01:18:45.820 --> 01:18:49.200]
Peter Gabriel or Genesis with Peter always put on great shows

[01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:55.360]
We'll put Peter Gabriel and Genesis as two separate ones. They can take you think how about speaking of Genesis

[01:18:55.360 --> 01:18:58.900]
How about trippy little Phil Collins? Okay, huh?

[01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:02.900]
Don't step on him now. No. Now he's a Phil Collins a good lot of votes

[01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:10.200]
This is outstanding man. What a great way to kill three hours and we got our big one to two hour kind of we got Joe Rose for the mad dog today

[01:19:10.200 --> 01:19:11.580]

195 days he's got off and of course Joe

[01:19:15.800 --> 01:19:21.080]
We know it's gonna have a very entertaining one to a two to four hour because he's gonna be talking about hour from Boko for two hours

[01:19:21.520 --> 01:19:28.780]
Maybe you'll have them on as against did let me ask you this did it ever done on Mo no that there must be some reason why everybody hates him

[01:19:28.780 --> 01:19:33.620]
That just means got this fascination with me and maybe it's I guess it's your fault my fault that everybody else hates him

[01:19:33.620 --> 01:19:35.040]
All we have nothing to do with it. That's it

[01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:41.420]
But did it ever dawn on him to start sitting there in moments of quiet food when they're changing his bag sticking the tubes deep inside his

[01:19:42.600 --> 01:19:47.980]
Wondering why is it that everybody hates me like poison is it that I'm full of crap that I'm a daughtering nasty old prick

[01:19:47.980 --> 01:19:53.320]
What is it that I do that causes everybody to just hate me like poison because everyone else is an asshole?

[01:19:53.740 --> 01:19:57.840]
I see so in other words he's in step the rest of us all just out of step. Okay. Thank you

[01:19:58.200 --> 01:20:00.400]

[01:24:38.100 --> 01:24:38.800]
Q. I am

[01:24:40.260 --> 01:24:40.620]
Hola

[01:24:42.600 --> 01:24:44.260]
No sale WQ. I am hello

[01:24:46.380 --> 01:24:47.220]
Q. A. M

[01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:52.860]
WQ. M three strikes in your mouth. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. I've got a few

[01:24:53.540 --> 01:24:55.280]
You said something in early you said

[01:24:55.280 --> 01:24:59.560]
Well, wait a moment. Yeah, let me just ask you this because you you see you've got a few

[01:24:59.560 --> 01:25:00.600]
Okay, I'll give you one

[01:25:01.240 --> 01:25:05.260]
No, but again the question is the greatest rock performer of all time. So how can there be a few?

[01:25:05.340 --> 01:25:08.820]
It's like saying the best of ten in restaurant in town is and then give me ten of them, you know

[01:25:08.820 --> 01:25:13.200]
Yeah, well, there's some really great ones though. I know. I know it's tough. Okay Bob Marley

[01:25:14.080 --> 01:25:14.440]
Okay

[01:25:15.680 --> 01:25:21.140]
Rock the Bob. Okay. Thanks, man. Yeah, you're welcome. See bye. Bye. Bye. You're welcome George Bob Marley. Yep

[01:25:21.740 --> 01:25:23.900]
Didn't like his haircut too much, but he uh, you know

[01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:27.040]
He could weigh a lot of a pound a sound

[01:25:27.760 --> 01:25:31.680]
The Little River band. Oh, I did not like the Little River band. You know at all

[01:25:31.680 --> 01:25:34.520]
I liked him for about a minute, you know, and then I got a real soul

[01:25:35.140 --> 01:25:35.500]
So

[01:25:36.360 --> 01:25:41.780]
And Maurice Canadian 2 and so is I hate to even say the words Celine Dion. Oh my god

[01:25:42.580 --> 01:25:46.600]
You know our good friend Dion who used to be our good friend. He had a suher to make her change her last name

[01:25:47.400 --> 01:25:51.980]
Probably because any collection connection between Celine Dion and music is purely coincidental. She blows

[01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:57.880]
Collective soul. Oh you too. Whoo. We'll want to put you to honor sure

[01:25:59.400 --> 01:26:04.700]
We're not too happy about it. We'll put it on there. How about the clash how about the clash man

[01:26:07.220 --> 01:26:12.760]
Get some real rock and roll on this list not a bunch of pansies. How about the Ramones? All right

[01:26:12.760 --> 01:26:17.700]
Rest Bob Marley just mentioned only moments ago Janice dropped the moments ago and the police did we put the police on there? Yes

[01:26:17.700 --> 01:26:19.860]
Or did the Beenerborg get paranoid

[01:26:21.060 --> 01:26:26.500]
In their heyday it says on this fact what effects are just pouring in here man. It's unbelievable

[01:26:27.340 --> 01:26:34.620]
In their heyday Emerson Lake and Palmer had unbelievable live performances including a giant mythical beast that flew over the stage

[01:26:34.620 --> 01:26:40.580]
Grand piano that rose to 40 feet off the ground a rotated end over and while Keith Emerson played it a revolving drum turret

[01:26:40.580 --> 01:26:43.960]
Power techniques and one one two then a floor crystal

[01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:50.040]
So it's putting the money Emerson Lake and Palmer got it not gonna get a lot of host though

[01:26:50.040 --> 01:26:54.460]
I think it's more of a generational thing with them. Mm-hmm out of sight out of mind long since

[01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:58.940]

[01:27:48.820 --> 01:27:53.780]
Betty says I've seen the stones arrowsmith guns and roses and numerous other acts, but non-compared to

[01:27:54.260 --> 01:27:57.540]
Are you ready ready cold play? Okay

[01:27:58.260 --> 01:28:01.740]
Their live performance is electrifying and filled with energy Chris Martin is a genius

[01:28:01.740 --> 01:28:06.800]
He plays the piano acoustic and electric guitars his voices rich and buttery. I'm in love with them. Hi, George

[01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:08.780]

Cold plays great. Oh my oh look at that. I wish I had to know this with a bitch Derek out earlier

[01:28:15.660 --> 01:28:22.600]
See how he spelled to me Hendrick somebody to somebody clues us in on this it says J.I. M.I. is if we didn't know we know our Jimmy Hendricks man

[01:28:23.720 --> 01:28:30.840]
And he spelled a Jimmy as in J.I. M. M. what that's depressing blast for me. It says and you are absolutely correct straight in it out Eric

[01:28:30.840 --> 01:28:32.680]
The mother. I am I

[01:28:33.700 --> 01:28:35.720]
Kind of like Diny, you know Jimmy while you do this

[01:28:37.160 --> 01:28:41.760]
Kind of like a Jimmy yeah and Danny and Danny and Jimmy

[01:28:42.660 --> 01:28:45.700]
You know I cut myself shaving this morning to dad to my other woe

[01:28:45.700 --> 01:28:49.040]
It's not that I want to belly it going here, but just a little nick I had like a bad blade or something

[01:28:49.500 --> 01:28:54.360]
And because I take the planets, you know that blood thinner and it just keeps it's not a big deal

[01:28:54.360 --> 01:28:57.800]
And it's not like bleeding all over my chin, but it's like, you know

[01:28:58.580 --> 01:29:05.420]
Doesn't want to stop I guess they don't make those stiptic pencils. It's a skeptic stiptic. Yeah, skeptic pencils. Do you know talking about?

[01:29:05.920 --> 01:29:11.300]
Absolutely, you must do the medicine cabinet. No, I do not have one. I should have you should they still make them yeah

[01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:16.360]
Oh my god, I remember I'm like a son of a bitch. Yeah, but they stopped the bleeding. Yeah, they do

[01:29:16.360 --> 01:29:20.340]
Well, maybe we could get one for Moe on those ratings here. Stop the bleeding stick it in his

[01:29:20.340 --> 01:29:20.960]
somewhere

[01:29:22.400 --> 01:29:27.680]
What about iron maiden somebody says Louise says that iron maiden? Okay. Why not? Why not?

[01:29:27.800 --> 01:29:31.820]
It's free. Not to lie. Okay, so that gets us all up today with the effects is here my god

[01:29:31.820 --> 01:29:35.260]
It's just a zillion of merry minutes about third man at least

[01:29:35.800 --> 01:29:39.780]
case you didn't hear Moe Howard david's numbers by the way the book that just came out today

[01:29:39.780 --> 01:29:47.420]
They blew they bit they stunt they suck. It was an embarrassment a humiliation. It was degrading subhuman

[01:29:47.420 --> 01:29:50.540]
So were they good? Huh? Were they good? No, no

[01:29:51.180 --> 01:29:54.900]
He could have reached the new I I think if we did a little bit of research in fact our good friend

[01:29:54.900 --> 01:29:57.520]
Maddie Bell I'm sure we'd be delighted to do that because he also hates Moe like poison

[01:29:58.280 --> 01:30:03.700]
If we did a little bit of research, you they could go back in the last what is that how many years they've been all sports about seven or eight

[01:30:04.460 --> 01:30:05.740]
No seriously how many you think

[01:30:06.520 --> 01:30:09.160]
Seven or eight sounds right. Yeah, seven or eight years they've been all sports

[01:30:09.160 --> 01:30:11.600]
I think if they went back through all in fact, muff might do that in the

[01:30:12.200 --> 01:30:14.580]
Hersberg time or clearance or the two of them could put their

[01:30:15.420 --> 01:30:17.760]
heads together and

[01:30:17.760 --> 01:30:20.700]
Come up with that information. I think that he broke the all-time lows

[01:30:20.700 --> 01:30:25.400]
So we can go on and say wow midday. We're not talking about midday. Okay. We did great. We're number one

[01:30:25.400 --> 01:30:29.760]
But we'll just just set that aside that we're just doing our Marcel Marcel imitation here anybody could be number one

[01:30:29.760 --> 01:30:34.500]
I'm a day where you try to deflect okay when you talk about your own numbers if they're really bad

[01:30:34.500 --> 01:30:38.540]
Talking about anybody else doing good and how does meaning anything is not an excuse mo

[01:30:38.540 --> 01:30:44.040]
Okay, in fact we need an asterisk for this book because how the hell did we follow follow you?

[01:30:44.480 --> 01:30:44.880]
careful

[01:30:45.940 --> 01:30:47.980]
What's one that flumb ball?

[01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:53.120]
No, you know, I just ate oh I just ate two grapes. Oh God

[01:30:53.660 --> 01:30:57.260]
Not in two grapes. I have a bunch of red and seedless grapes in refrigerator

[01:30:57.740 --> 01:31:01.260]
I don't know. I was just jonjen for something sweet. I put two grapes in my push and man

[01:31:01.260 --> 01:31:05.640]
Like that is so if we should hear you choke since no one's there to him like you

[01:31:05.640 --> 01:31:11.080]
What's the it would be you could say in my amputein Neil Neil choke on sour grapes. What's the Canadian number for 911?

[01:31:16.860 --> 01:31:20.280]

[01:32:10.840 --> 01:32:13.260]

[01:35:09.440 --> 01:35:11.280]
and

[01:35:18.320 --> 01:35:25.640]
Probably T-560 WQM now, Sean and Hollywood is a regular chronic factor, and I used to like a lot until, and I, he's in Teddo's opinion, thanks for full of crap.

[01:35:26.360 --> 01:35:33.420]
He says, I personally hold a view that you are the risen Christ, but when it comes to every breath you take, and I in the sky, listen closely, says the same song.

[01:35:33.880 --> 01:35:37.140]
Sure. I must respectfully insert the puke card here, he says.

[01:35:39.820 --> 01:35:46.200]
Every breath you take is a funeral dourge with a juvenile top sticks like cord progression that was played on nauseam, ended up running a Grammy.

[01:35:46.440 --> 01:35:51.960]
No, don't worry, be happy, also want to Grammy. I'd rather hear my own Requiem, he says. Or maybe just Requiem, for dream.

[01:35:52.340 --> 01:35:58.960]
Yeah. The cool thing about your pull is that the best brands don't always translate into the best concerts, may I suggest...

[01:35:58.960 --> 01:35:59.680]
Yes.

[01:35:59.680 --> 01:36:05.500]
Yes, for a good mix of sound quality music, music and the actress, as Sean and the answer is...

[01:36:05.500 --> 01:36:09.380]
Yes, you can suggest, yes, don't be, we had to put in our pull, but we will, because we're in a good mood, right?

[01:36:09.760 --> 01:36:11.320]
Yes. What we...

[01:36:11.320 --> 01:36:11.380]
Yes.

[01:36:12.160 --> 01:36:18.840]
It says, a friend once dragged me kicking and screaming to the Charlie Daniels van Constan years before he became a PTL side show.

[01:36:19.320 --> 01:36:23.160]
I went on over the promise to be playing a drug in country's skank, it was great.

[01:36:23.160 --> 01:36:27.480]
The band members were all great instrumentalists, good graphics, great songs, hadn't heard better since.

[01:36:27.900 --> 01:36:31.840]
The good tunes never get airplay. We want to put Charlie Daniels van on there, why not?

[01:36:32.720 --> 01:36:37.100]
Let's put, and Charlie Daniels van on there, just for the hell of it.

[01:36:37.200 --> 01:36:41.600]
Boy, they're sure a lot of stuff pouring in, man. Just pouring in here, including...

[01:36:41.600 --> 01:36:43.340]
Where the hell was the one that I, where is it?

[01:36:44.100 --> 01:36:50.760]
Because I found, I actually found the song, this will shock, this will absolutely shock whoever sent that in, but I can't find it in facts.

[01:36:51.440 --> 01:36:56.040]
The one that had the Mitch Ryder, right? You know the one I'm talking about?

[01:36:56.160 --> 01:36:58.640]
Here it is. Here it is, thank you very much.

[01:36:59.280 --> 01:37:02.280]
It says, the Kingsword Too Bad, we all want to put the Kings on there?

[01:37:02.440 --> 01:37:03.920]
Absolutely. Kingsword great.

[01:37:04.160 --> 01:37:04.340]
Sure.

[01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.540]
In fact, you know who would like the Kings, I bet you'll see their crews.

[01:37:07.640 --> 01:37:08.920]
Is that 80s, okay, welcome in.

[01:37:09.200 --> 01:37:11.680]
No, I'm coming. Can you imagine her singing Lola?

[01:37:12.660 --> 01:37:14.240]
Oh, that's you sweetheart.

[01:37:15.340 --> 01:37:18.760]
Anyway, this fact says, love the stones of Aerosmith, but...

[01:37:18.760 --> 01:37:22.540]
But, Mitch Ryder and, oh, this is one of our list, there's an April Springs.

[01:37:23.060 --> 01:37:23.480]
Have I got pardon?

[01:37:23.880 --> 01:37:25.740]
I just know where you're going, so I'm groaning right now.

[01:37:28.100 --> 01:37:28.460]
Why?

[01:37:28.560 --> 01:37:29.400]
Just because we have it?

[01:37:29.800 --> 01:37:31.800]
No, just because there's suggestions.

[01:37:32.320 --> 01:37:35.420]
Mitch Ryder and the friggin' Detroit wheels the best rockers ever.

[01:37:37.320 --> 01:37:38.400]
You knew this was in there?

[01:37:38.540 --> 01:37:38.940]
Yeah, I know.

[01:37:39.340 --> 01:37:42.000]
Well, I knew it was the same blue yet, the clock yet.

[01:37:43.560 --> 01:37:44.900]
What if Nancy stay in line?

[01:37:45.280 --> 01:37:45.700]
Work, work.

[01:37:47.280 --> 01:37:47.940]
You're stuck.

[01:37:48.240 --> 01:37:50.480]
I have been in there all the time.

[01:37:51.600 --> 01:37:52.300]
Jump up.

[01:37:52.960 --> 01:37:53.360]
Get it.

[01:37:54.700 --> 01:37:55.360]
That's enough.

[01:37:57.080 --> 01:37:58.680]
You don't like Mitch Ryder and the Detroit wheels?

[01:37:58.880 --> 01:37:59.000]
No.

[01:37:59.060 --> 01:38:00.520]
I think you're a friggin' communist man.

[01:38:00.660 --> 01:38:00.860]
Maybe.

[01:38:02.200 --> 01:38:07.440]
God, and what kind of a slut keeps hangs on to a dress bluer otherwise with a cumstain on it, huh?

[01:38:07.600 --> 01:38:08.500]
That's my question.

[01:38:08.720 --> 01:38:09.160]
It's that slut.

[01:38:09.560 --> 01:38:12.800]
A fat disgusting slut, an opportunistic slut.

[01:38:12.800 --> 01:38:15.380]
It wants the black meal somebody and make a fortune.

[01:38:16.320 --> 01:38:18.360]
Cow, pig, disgusting slut.

[01:38:19.880 --> 01:38:22.620]
And of course, the American media got to make a...

[01:38:22.620 --> 01:38:23.780]
Oh, she's the amarder.

[01:38:23.920 --> 01:38:25.620]
You know, she's celebrity now.

[01:38:25.620 --> 01:38:26.000]
You're good.

[01:38:26.500 --> 01:38:26.960]
You slut.

[01:38:27.380 --> 01:38:27.840]
You whore.

[01:38:27.920 --> 01:38:28.520]
Well said.

[01:38:28.780 --> 01:38:29.720]
Couldn't have said a bit of myself.

[01:38:30.500 --> 01:38:31.780]
Here's Rich and Palm Beach says,

[01:38:31.980 --> 01:38:33.560]
Neal's poll, some notable left-outs.

[01:38:34.040 --> 01:38:34.540]
Primus.

[01:38:35.320 --> 01:38:35.560]
Mm-hmm.

[01:38:36.740 --> 01:38:37.100]
Mm-hmm.

[01:38:37.900 --> 01:38:38.880]
I like primus.

[01:38:39.720 --> 01:38:40.120]
Mm-hmm.

[01:38:41.680 --> 01:38:43.860]
Is he still on MSNBC in the morning?

[01:38:44.700 --> 01:38:44.860]
Yes.

[01:38:45.400 --> 01:38:46.080]
Primus in the morning.

[01:38:46.420 --> 01:38:47.080]
King Crimson.

[01:38:47.220 --> 01:38:48.440]
King Crimson moves on here.

[01:38:48.540 --> 01:38:48.640]
Sure.

[01:38:49.040 --> 01:38:49.800]
The sex pistols?

[01:38:50.760 --> 01:38:51.500]
How are they doing?

[01:38:53.060 --> 01:38:54.100]
Well, Johnny's just fine.

[01:38:55.240 --> 01:38:55.960]
Psychedelic fruers?

[01:38:58.300 --> 01:38:58.960]
What is this?

[01:38:59.120 --> 01:39:00.180]
Van House, Bauhaus?

[01:39:00.380 --> 01:39:00.740]
Bauhaus.

[01:39:01.140 --> 01:39:01.500]
Bauhaus?

[01:39:01.640 --> 01:39:02.000]
How?

[01:39:02.120 --> 01:39:03.020]
See, I don't know any of these groups.

[01:39:03.120 --> 01:39:04.720]
This is not my bag at all.

[01:39:04.860 --> 01:39:05.680]
Okay, I'm an old fart, huh?

[01:39:06.020 --> 01:39:07.580]
Bauhaus is old, like from the 80s.

[01:39:07.820 --> 01:39:08.680]
Bauhaus is old.

[01:39:08.960 --> 01:39:09.740]
Speaking of Bauhaus.

[01:39:09.740 --> 01:39:10.580]
Is that 80s?

[01:39:10.700 --> 01:39:11.260]
I'm not going to get it.

[01:39:11.900 --> 01:39:13.560]
Enjoy the vision, Rich and Palm Beach.

[01:39:13.640 --> 01:39:14.620]
When you put whatever ones on there,

[01:39:14.720 --> 01:39:16.760]
I'll leave that to you, because that's way out of my league.

[01:39:16.840 --> 01:39:18.220]
Okay, a crusty old fart like me.

[01:39:18.420 --> 01:39:19.320]
What do I know from that, Dreck?

[01:39:19.720 --> 01:39:19.820]
Huh?

[01:39:20.500 --> 01:39:20.860]
I don't know.

[01:39:21.060 --> 01:39:21.520]
What do you know?

[01:39:21.520 --> 01:39:22.400]
I don't know from that stuff.

[01:39:22.960 --> 01:39:23.440]
There were no ones.

[01:39:24.040 --> 01:39:25.200]
Did we ever put the revolts on there?

[01:39:25.380 --> 01:39:25.840]
I thought we did.

[01:39:26.240 --> 01:39:26.360]
Yep.

[01:39:27.140 --> 01:39:27.320]
Okay.

[01:39:27.880 --> 01:39:29.320]
Sex pistols we did, Johnny, run.

[01:39:29.580 --> 01:39:30.100]
And white snake.

[01:39:30.100 --> 01:39:30.920]
Then we put that on there.

[01:39:31.020 --> 01:39:32.360]
Did you veto it because you were hard-ass?

[01:39:32.480 --> 01:39:33.300]
Well, put it on there now.

[01:39:33.520 --> 01:39:34.100]
Okay, then be told.

[01:39:34.260 --> 01:39:35.000]
We just discussed it right now.

[01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:36.020]
Actually, what's the concert?

[01:39:36.980 --> 01:39:37.540]
The end.

[01:39:37.900 --> 01:39:39.620]
It was a very good concert.

[01:39:39.800 --> 01:39:40.460]
It put on a very good show.

[01:39:40.660 --> 01:39:42.120]
Well, excuse us, okay?

[01:39:42.300 --> 01:39:44.760]
I mean, what you say that like, well, like, there you go.

[01:39:45.920 --> 01:39:46.900]
I don't care.

[01:39:47.180 --> 01:39:47.640]
I don't care.

[01:39:47.800 --> 01:39:48.240]
I don't protest.

[01:39:48.420 --> 01:39:50.500]
I'm not one of these people that pretends to know all the music

[01:39:50.500 --> 01:39:52.920]
from like 100 years or all the movies or all the,

[01:39:52.960 --> 01:39:53.340]
I don't know.

[01:39:53.720 --> 01:39:53.920]
Crap.

[01:39:54.420 --> 01:39:58.120]
If I knew crap, I sure as I wouldn't be here working two days a week

[01:39:58.120 --> 01:39:58.820]
over a hot mic.

[01:40:00.840 --> 01:40:02.360]
447 votes on the pool.

[01:40:02.540 --> 01:40:04.480]
Each or hard out, more, your numbers suck.

[01:40:04.480 --> 01:40:06.380]
Your paycheck is stealing.

[01:40:06.600 --> 01:40:08.640]
Every time it gets a paycheck, it's like stealing, you know?

[01:40:08.980 --> 01:40:09.160]
Mm-hmm.

[01:40:09.240 --> 01:40:10.100]
You gotta be on death row.

[01:40:11.700 --> 01:40:12.420]
Stones 54.

[01:40:13.240 --> 01:40:15.300]
Oh, I look who's moving toward the top.

[01:40:15.520 --> 01:40:16.380]
Is that aegitake?

[01:40:16.520 --> 01:40:17.260]
I'm in a no.

[01:40:17.420 --> 01:40:19.460]
See, and I'm in for, that's bad, because I'm influencing that.

[01:40:19.720 --> 01:40:21.200]
Yeah, we need to balance it out.

[01:40:21.380 --> 01:40:21.380]

[01:40:21.520 --> 01:40:22.060]
You're pushing it.

[01:40:22.160 --> 01:40:22.340]
You're pushing it.

[01:40:22.440 --> 01:40:22.440]

[01:40:24.400 --> 01:40:24.900]
See, great.

[01:40:25.540 --> 01:40:27.760]
So, see, very hard one.

[01:40:30.500 --> 01:40:31.000]
Hard one.

[01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:31.020]
Hard one.

[01:40:33.260 --> 01:40:33.580]
I'm in for it.

[01:40:33.580 --> 01:40:37.100]
Everywhere I live, I'm in for it.

[01:40:37.460 --> 01:40:38.920]
You're in for it.

[01:40:39.840 --> 01:40:42.560]
I guarantee if she wouldn't have croaked in that, you know,

[01:40:42.600 --> 01:40:44.300]
at that early time, if she could have been here tomorrow,

[01:40:44.440 --> 01:40:45.340]
we'd have gone over half a minute.

[01:40:45.440 --> 01:40:46.180]
Is that aegitake?

[01:40:46.320 --> 01:40:48.600]
That would have been, she would have been the one they,

[01:40:48.860 --> 01:40:49.840]
when I put us over the wood pile.

[01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:50.780]
We could have had a call in.

[01:40:51.920 --> 01:40:52.560]
Stones 54.

[01:40:53.540 --> 01:40:54.180]
Seedrick 47.

[01:40:54.620 --> 01:40:54.780]
Cruz.

[01:40:55.800 --> 01:40:56.440]
Beatles 45.

[01:40:56.660 --> 01:40:58.500]
Even a hand of the Beatles, how do you like that?

[01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:02.020]
Did you ever see any of those old tapes from the Ed Sullivan show where he had them on?

[01:41:02.240 --> 01:41:02.360]
Yeah.

[01:41:02.760 --> 01:41:04.500]
And said the Beatles, the Beatles.

[01:41:05.180 --> 01:41:05.380]
The Beatles.

[01:41:05.880 --> 01:41:07.640]
Shoot, I'd never understood him.

[01:41:08.180 --> 01:41:08.700]
Or as...

[01:41:08.700 --> 01:41:11.860]
Murf Griffin said one time, the fabulous VGs.

[01:41:12.620 --> 01:41:14.300]
Why don't remember things like that?

[01:41:14.460 --> 01:41:16.220]
Yeah, because they were so bad and so embarrassing.

[01:41:16.840 --> 01:41:16.840]

[01:41:16.840 --> 01:41:18.980]
And another man with no talent whatsoever.

[01:41:19.620 --> 01:41:20.060]
Could he sing?

[01:41:20.260 --> 01:41:21.200]
Could he play the piano?

[01:41:21.420 --> 01:41:22.120]
Could he act?

[01:41:22.220 --> 01:41:23.320]
Did he do good interviews?

[01:41:23.700 --> 01:41:24.460]
Did he have a good show?

[01:41:24.620 --> 01:41:24.700]
No.

[01:41:24.880 --> 01:41:26.300]
But he invented a wheel of fortune.

[01:41:26.840 --> 01:41:27.280]
Well then.

[01:41:27.280 --> 01:41:31.580]
And a bunch of other games shows, which is why he's got the...

[01:41:31.580 --> 01:41:33.480]
He has a deep buried in the closet.

[01:41:33.760 --> 01:41:35.020]
Harry coconuts or something like that?

[01:41:35.700 --> 01:41:37.080]
No, he didn't have Harry coconuts.

[01:41:37.200 --> 01:41:38.240]
I don't think he had any coconuts.

[01:41:38.520 --> 01:41:39.820]
Did he have a lovely pair of Harry coconuts?

[01:41:40.120 --> 01:41:42.320]
Danny Adenio said he had no coconuts.

[01:41:44.680 --> 01:41:45.580]
Remember Danny Adenio?

[01:41:45.700 --> 01:41:45.900]
Yeah.

[01:41:47.320 --> 01:41:48.760]
He had the fever all right.

[01:41:49.380 --> 01:41:50.940]
He said Peter in the morning and fever at night.

[01:41:52.780 --> 01:41:53.500]
Beatles 45.

[01:41:54.620 --> 01:41:55.940]
You don't even know what that means.

[01:41:56.540 --> 01:41:59.740]
When I worked in Sarasota on WSPB about 100 years ago...

[01:41:59.740 --> 01:42:00.640]
You know how many years ago?

[01:42:00.740 --> 01:42:01.580]
About 30 minutes.

[01:42:01.680 --> 01:42:02.740]
Exactly, 1973.

[01:42:03.980 --> 01:42:07.120]
See that throppin comes in real handy once in a blue moon.

[01:42:07.280 --> 01:42:08.680]
About 30 minutes.

[01:42:08.780 --> 01:42:08.940]
Years.

[01:42:09.900 --> 01:42:12.940]
We had a guy who used to do morning show called Peter Johns.

[01:42:14.040 --> 01:42:16.860]
Very pompous, deep voice, deep voice, but a real pompous ass.

[01:42:17.460 --> 01:42:18.440]
He did a morning show.

[01:42:18.580 --> 01:42:20.980]
I did mid days and then we had a guy called Lowell Schumacher.

[01:42:20.980 --> 01:42:22.420]
The old turkey buzzer was his nickname.

[01:42:22.480 --> 01:42:23.000]
Wacky guy.

[01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:23.420]
He was fun.

[01:42:23.420 --> 01:42:26.620]
He was kind of like Suds Coleman, only a bigger skinnier guy.

[01:42:28.240 --> 01:42:29.420]
At any rate, one day...

[01:42:30.980 --> 01:42:32.300]
Of course, keep in mind, this is 73.

[01:42:33.680 --> 01:42:36.160]
And here's Lowell Schumacher, the old turkey buzzer, who is on here.

[01:42:36.200 --> 01:42:37.060]
And he's promoting the lineup.

[01:42:37.220 --> 01:42:38.840]
He says, of course, don't forget tomorrow morning at 6.

[01:42:38.980 --> 01:42:40.680]
It's Peter Johns.

[01:42:40.960 --> 01:42:41.820]
He says, you know what they say?

[01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:43.680]
Peter in the morning and fever all night.

[01:42:45.280 --> 01:42:46.620]
I heard a different version of it.

[01:42:47.220 --> 01:42:48.700]
And he just lost it.

[01:42:48.880 --> 01:42:50.960]
I mean, I think we had to pick him up off the floor.

[01:42:50.960 --> 01:42:53.040]
He just never recovered practically.

[01:42:53.120 --> 01:42:54.740]
We had to put him into an oxygen tank.

[01:42:54.880 --> 01:42:56.920]
He just... that was the old turkey buzzer.

[01:42:56.980 --> 01:42:59.120]
My close personal friend Lowell Schumacher.

[01:42:59.140 --> 01:43:00.640]
Got only knows where he might be right now.

[01:43:00.760 --> 01:43:01.580]
Did you say turkey buzzer?

[01:43:02.480 --> 01:43:03.640]
The turkey buzzer.

[01:43:04.760 --> 01:43:05.200]
Yeah.

[01:43:06.320 --> 01:43:07.420]
55 for the stones.

[01:43:07.620 --> 01:43:08.660]
48 for Celia.

[01:43:08.800 --> 01:43:10.360]
Maybe she's moving in on the stones.

[01:43:10.460 --> 01:43:12.180]
Wait till she catches Mick Jagger.

[01:43:12.660 --> 01:43:13.920]
Wait till she hops on his ass.

[01:43:14.580 --> 01:43:15.460]
To run for his life.

[01:43:16.660 --> 01:43:17.540]
Beavils 45.

[01:43:17.860 --> 01:43:19.100]
And after that, it's...

[01:43:19.100 --> 01:43:19.900]
Forget about it.

[01:43:20.440 --> 01:43:22.240]
Here's one that says, the village people, what are you saying?

[01:43:22.780 --> 01:43:22.960]
Sure.

[01:43:23.520 --> 01:43:24.060]
They were good at it.

[01:43:24.140 --> 01:43:25.080]
They put on a hell of a show.

[01:43:25.280 --> 01:43:27.320]
It was... it was... it was... it was... it was funny.

[01:43:28.020 --> 01:43:29.760]
Here's one that says, the grateful dead question.

[01:43:29.860 --> 01:43:30.740]
Mark, did we put them on there?

[01:43:31.140 --> 01:43:31.560]
I thought we did.

[01:43:31.920 --> 01:43:33.520]
Even though we are very invertebrate.

[01:43:33.800 --> 01:43:33.920]
We did.

[01:43:34.280 --> 01:43:36.360]
We had a lot of fans wanting to see Jerry in a gang.

[01:43:36.820 --> 01:43:38.840]
And if we would have been for them, we never would have had no fish food either.

[01:43:40.580 --> 01:43:41.860]
Not that I have any idea what...

[01:43:41.860 --> 01:43:43.160]
It's the same concept, right?

[01:43:43.700 --> 01:43:45.940]
The whole bed in Jury's thing would have grateful dead in the fish food.

[01:43:46.520 --> 01:43:49.020]
My favorite says this one is the chorus.

[01:43:49.140 --> 01:43:50.520]
Not cars, but the chorus.

[01:43:50.700 --> 01:43:50.940]
You are.

[01:43:51.240 --> 01:43:52.280]
Yeah, the chorus are good.

[01:43:52.400 --> 01:43:52.960]
I like the chorus.

[01:43:53.180 --> 01:43:53.920]
How do you like that?

[01:43:54.080 --> 01:43:54.460]
I'm shocked.

[01:43:54.600 --> 01:43:56.140]
You know of them.

[01:43:56.920 --> 01:43:58.080]
Because all that...

[01:43:58.080 --> 01:43:59.900]
That European MTV stuff.

[01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:00.980]
All those videos?

[01:44:01.820 --> 01:44:02.280]
That's right.

[01:44:02.360 --> 01:44:02.940]
You're the lucky one.

[01:44:03.160 --> 01:44:03.540]
Aha!

[01:44:04.020 --> 01:44:04.320]
That's right.

[01:44:04.600 --> 01:44:07.180]
They actually show videos on TV and Europe boys and girls.

[01:44:07.300 --> 01:44:08.100]
They break the news here.

[01:44:08.560 --> 01:44:10.240]
I know it's an alien concept, MTV.

[01:44:10.500 --> 01:44:11.580]
And they should only croak at MTV.

[01:44:11.940 --> 01:44:13.180]
And especially, what's his name?

[01:44:13.180 --> 01:44:14.380]
They should take with them right off the bat.

[01:44:15.620 --> 01:44:16.020]
Carson...

[01:44:16.020 --> 01:44:17.220]
Carson Deely.

[01:44:17.340 --> 01:44:17.460]
Of course.

[01:44:17.560 --> 01:44:17.900]
The other day.

[01:44:18.020 --> 01:44:18.020]

[01:44:18.020 --> 01:44:18.020]

[01:44:18.140 --> 01:44:18.140]

[01:44:18.320 --> 01:44:18.560]
The other day.

[01:44:18.660 --> 01:44:18.660]

[01:44:18.840 --> 01:44:18.840]

[01:44:19.160 --> 01:44:19.720]
The other day.

[01:44:19.720 --> 01:44:19.900]
The other day.

[01:44:19.900 --> 01:44:19.900]

[01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:20.000]

[01:44:20.960 --> 01:44:21.220]

[01:44:21.300 --> 01:44:21.500]

[01:44:21.700 --> 01:44:22.100]

[01:44:22.100 --> 01:44:22.100]

[01:44:22.100 --> 01:44:22.100]

[01:44:22.260 --> 01:44:22.760]

[01:44:23.040 --> 01:44:23.080]

[01:44:23.080 --> 01:44:23.600]

[01:44:23.760 --> 01:44:25.180]

[01:44:54.240 --> 01:44:54.240]

[01:44:54.240 --> 01:44:54.240]

[01:44:54.240 --> 01:44:54.440]

[01:46:05.460 --> 01:46:06.120]
The other day.

[01:46:06.120 --> 01:46:07.080]
The other day.

[01:46:07.400 --> 01:46:08.180]
The other day.

[01:46:12.820 --> 01:46:14.020]
The other day.

[01:46:14.020 --> 01:46:14.300]
The other day.

[01:46:14.300 --> 01:46:14.300]

[01:46:14.300 --> 01:46:14.300]

[01:46:14.300 --> 01:46:14.300]

[01:46:14.300 --> 01:46:14.300]

[01:46:15.820 --> 01:46:16.460]
Oh, gosh.

[01:46:16.500 --> 01:46:17.500]
Look at that twerk, though.

[01:46:17.500 --> 01:46:17.500]

[01:46:17.500 --> 01:46:17.500]

[01:46:18.780 --> 01:46:19.100]
Keywatch.

[01:46:19.560 --> 01:46:19.700]
Keywatch.

[01:46:19.700 --> 01:46:19.880]
Keywatch.

[01:46:19.880 --> 01:46:19.920]
Keywatch.

[01:46:19.920 --> 01:46:19.920]

[01:46:21.680 --> 01:46:22.720]
1232 at 560.

[01:46:22.860 --> 01:46:25.100]
Now, where's that the thanks about the crap macaroni and cheese?

[01:46:25.340 --> 01:46:26.060]
Oh, here it is from Mark.

[01:46:27.180 --> 01:46:29.820]
It says Toronto's own very naked ladies deserve to be on the list.

[01:46:29.980 --> 01:46:30.520]
And you are...

[01:46:30.520 --> 01:46:31.860]
I'm so lovely, correct.

[01:46:32.220 --> 01:46:33.740]
So, I'm pretty sure they're going to be at the concert.

[01:46:34.040 --> 01:46:35.200]
Are they going to be at the concert, George?

[01:46:35.420 --> 01:46:35.780]
Are they going to be at the concert, George?

[01:46:35.780 --> 01:46:35.780]

[01:46:35.780 --> 01:46:37.140]
Are they going to be at the concert, George?

[01:46:37.220 --> 01:46:40.480]
Are they going to be at the concert?

[01:46:40.580 --> 01:46:43.880]
Are they going to be at the concert, George?

[01:46:43.880 --> 01:46:44.600]
I'm going to hang on with.

[01:46:44.720 --> 01:46:46.120]
This is better than sex.

[01:46:46.540 --> 01:46:48.760]
You can't hold Jesus Christ.

[01:46:49.480 --> 01:46:50.560]
And in fact, it's...

[01:46:50.560 --> 01:46:51.000]
All right.

[01:46:51.200 --> 01:46:51.640]
That'd be funny.

[01:46:52.400 --> 01:46:53.060]
There it is.

[01:46:53.480 --> 01:46:55.120]
The more Howard David of Keychains.

[01:46:55.220 --> 01:46:55.680]
Sounds great.

[01:46:55.800 --> 01:46:56.860]
That'd be crunchy, clean.

[01:46:57.680 --> 01:47:02.400]
We're going to have our fundraiser for a band and pet rescue again this year, starting August 1, which is only a couple days away.

[01:47:03.360 --> 01:47:07.360]
And we're going to have the best of Neil 2002-2003 since we didn't have it this last year.

[01:47:07.900 --> 01:47:10.140]
And we might actually sell a few of those before they start...

[01:47:10.140 --> 01:47:13.060]
Before they start making those illegal copies, which we hate people who do that.

[01:47:13.060 --> 01:47:14.580]
And you're going to wind up going to jail.

[01:47:15.060 --> 01:47:16.140]
But anyway, that's all.

[01:47:16.200 --> 01:47:17.420]
Now, how are we going to do that?

[01:47:17.540 --> 01:47:18.940]
Is it going to be available on the Web August 1?

[01:47:19.580 --> 01:47:20.140]
That on our website?

[01:47:21.140 --> 01:47:22.040]
What do you mean you don't know?

[01:47:22.220 --> 01:47:22.760]
Who does know?

[01:47:23.360 --> 01:47:25.220]
Everything should be ready in the week of August 1.

[01:47:25.520 --> 01:47:27.300]
Everything should be ready in the week of August 1.

[01:47:28.620 --> 01:47:31.060]
Well, the week of August 1, the last time I checked it was Friday.

[01:47:31.780 --> 01:47:33.220]
Well, the week of August 2nd, like I said.

[01:47:33.400 --> 01:47:34.040]
Third, fourth.

[01:47:34.180 --> 01:47:35.200]
Whatever that week is.

[01:47:35.780 --> 01:47:36.580]
And then, the week of August, like I said, in the week of August.

[01:47:36.580 --> 01:47:37.600]
First week of August, does that?

[01:47:37.600 --> 01:47:38.260]
August, okay.

[01:47:38.340 --> 01:47:38.820]
August 4th.

[01:47:38.840 --> 01:47:39.480]
Just calm down.

[01:47:39.480 --> 01:47:42.960]
Okay, I realize it's a little bit tough math there working all the way from the first to the fourth.

[01:47:43.540 --> 01:47:44.700]
Oh, we don't have the same age.

[01:47:44.940 --> 01:47:46.080]
Sounds like Monday the Fourth.

[01:47:46.120 --> 01:47:47.760]
So in other words, next week, you'll be in the week.

[01:47:47.760 --> 01:47:48.480]
Monday, going to the Wednesday.

[01:47:48.620 --> 01:47:49.380]
One of the Saturdays.

[01:47:49.860 --> 01:47:51.460]
Now, who am I supposed to be looking for, Bernadette?

[01:47:51.500 --> 01:47:51.840]
I don't know.

[01:47:52.400 --> 01:47:53.040]
Bernadette Peters.

[01:47:53.520 --> 01:47:54.480]
I don't see the list here.

[01:47:54.540 --> 01:47:58.460]
And of course, that's this freaking Toronto national post.

[01:47:58.760 --> 01:48:00.040]
This paper blows, man.

[01:48:00.340 --> 01:48:02.320]
In fact, this paper is right there with Harold and the Sunsental.

[01:48:02.480 --> 01:48:02.960]
Thank the Lord.

[01:48:03.060 --> 01:48:04.200]
We got three other newspapers here.

[01:48:04.400 --> 01:48:06.820]
We got four daily newspapers here, like in a real city.

[01:48:07.180 --> 01:48:08.200]
And this one sucks.

[01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:10.860]
But they give it away free and the price is right.

[01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:12.720]
Anyway, we'll get Bernadette ladies on there.

[01:48:12.800 --> 01:48:13.420]
Got it, be in her head.

[01:48:13.840 --> 01:48:14.220]
We got it.

[01:48:15.060 --> 01:48:18.060]
They're excellent musicians who do an amazing job of getting the audience involved in their show.

[01:48:18.200 --> 01:48:23.300]
It's unfortunately because many of their best-known songs employ amusing and intentionally childlike lyrics.

[01:48:23.580 --> 01:48:25.440]
They're often, I'm fairly dismissed as a.

[01:48:26.080 --> 01:48:26.580]
What am I missing?

[01:48:26.900 --> 01:48:27.340]
I thought you had to.

[01:48:27.360 --> 01:48:28.220]
What did you need to talk about?

[01:48:28.240 --> 01:48:29.320]
What is he talking to?

[01:48:29.740 --> 01:48:30.240]
Let me go.

[01:48:31.640 --> 01:48:33.220]
Why is he talking on the ear?

[01:48:33.660 --> 01:48:34.340]
It's one of those things.

[01:48:37.500 --> 01:48:38.500]
What an asshole.

[01:48:39.240 --> 01:48:40.800]
Anyway, intentionally a childlike lyrics.

[01:48:40.800 --> 01:48:42.540]
They're often unfrily dismissed as an obli group.

[01:48:42.640 --> 01:48:46.040]
However, I know many got people who've changed their opinion when they saw them live.

[01:48:46.560 --> 01:48:47.020]
Great showmen.

[01:48:48.200 --> 01:48:48.940]
Great showmen.

[01:48:49.100 --> 01:48:49.480]
Great guys.

[01:48:49.600 --> 01:48:53.800]
What other band could have their fans throwing boxes of craft macaroni and cheese at them and not have it being installed?

[01:48:54.200 --> 01:48:56.300]
Great show is always says market and honor with that fact.

[01:48:56.460 --> 01:48:57.540]
What are craft foods?

[01:48:57.860 --> 01:48:59.380]
Part of the Philip Norris family.

[01:48:59.660 --> 01:49:02.180]
And we know what your kids want for dinner.

[01:49:02.180 --> 01:49:04.860]
More craft nicotine and cheese please.

[01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:12.180]
It's craft-zone creamy delicious processed cheese melted over pure hugely addictive nicotine.

[01:49:13.020 --> 01:49:13.940]
Kids love it.

[01:49:15.760 --> 01:49:17.120]
It's the nicotine.

[01:49:17.480 --> 01:49:18.320]
It's the cheese.

[01:49:19.500 --> 01:49:20.800]
No, you're right.

[01:49:21.020 --> 01:49:21.880]
It's the nicotine.

[01:49:22.160 --> 01:49:24.800]
My kids can't get enough of craft nicotine and cheese.

[01:49:25.020 --> 01:49:26.240]
Where is it you old hag?

[01:49:26.460 --> 01:49:27.040]
Where is it?

[01:49:27.480 --> 01:49:28.360]
Now, Pilly.

[01:49:28.760 --> 01:49:30.280]
Stop digging under those seat cushions.

[01:49:30.280 --> 01:49:32.520]
I've got more nicotine and cheese right here.

[01:49:32.580 --> 01:49:34.060]
Oh, great mom.

[01:49:35.700 --> 01:49:36.260]
Mmm.

[01:49:37.260 --> 01:49:39.040]
Craft nicotine and cheese.

[01:49:39.780 --> 01:49:41.180]
It's the nicotine.

[01:49:41.700 --> 01:49:43.460]
Craft nicotine and cheese.

[01:49:43.700 --> 01:49:45.120]
Part of the Philip Norris family.

[01:49:45.400 --> 01:49:50.140]
We keep trying to distance ourselves from being an evil representative of tobacco-related death.

[01:49:50.380 --> 01:49:52.360]
But somehow it just isn't working.

[01:49:52.520 --> 01:49:53.300]
That's all moody unlucky.

[01:49:53.480 --> 01:49:53.760]
Exactly.

[01:49:54.400 --> 01:49:55.480]
I thought I'd drop that in there.

[01:49:55.600 --> 01:49:56.000]
It's kind of cute.

[01:49:56.800 --> 01:49:57.660]
I like it.

[01:49:58.120 --> 01:49:58.740]
I loved it.

[01:49:58.740 --> 01:50:00.480]
And obviously they did too, the whole family.

[01:50:00.780 --> 01:50:03.160]
Here's a fact from Josh and Volko who says, no joke.

[01:50:03.780 --> 01:50:06.840]
The best performance I've ever seen is from a band called Gwarr.

[01:50:07.240 --> 01:50:07.760]
He's right.

[01:50:08.140 --> 01:50:08.540]
Gwarr?

[01:50:09.300 --> 01:50:09.920]
He's right?

[01:50:10.160 --> 01:50:11.520]
Well, they're kind of performance artists.

[01:50:11.840 --> 01:50:13.180]
I don't think Gwarr or Gwarr.

[01:50:13.380 --> 01:50:13.640]
Gwarr.

[01:50:15.320 --> 01:50:16.860]
It's a lot of, it's a visual thing.

[01:50:17.020 --> 01:50:20.340]
They wear crazy, crazy costumes made of form rubbery and...

[01:50:20.340 --> 01:50:20.740]
That sounds like...

[01:50:22.440 --> 01:50:23.560]
Yeah, that's what that sounds a little like.

[01:50:23.700 --> 01:50:26.580]
Now, then they take people from the audience and they have this monster, suck them up.

[01:50:27.240 --> 01:50:28.360]
They have monsters suck them?

[01:50:28.360 --> 01:50:30.940]
Yes, up and down.

[01:50:31.400 --> 01:50:32.500]
And otherwise, yeah.

[01:50:32.880 --> 01:50:33.500]
I'll be damned.

[01:50:33.780 --> 01:50:38.200]
Anyways, as Gwarr is the band that plays Fokie Metal and Hoses, the audience down with Take Blood

[01:50:38.200 --> 01:50:41.100]
is the battle, the battle enemies on stage is a great show.

[01:50:41.460 --> 01:50:43.060]
And let's get them on their GWAR.

[01:50:43.260 --> 01:50:44.560]
Okay, I used to work on that station.

[01:50:45.780 --> 01:50:48.460]
Here's one that says, how about Aureo Speedwagon, eh?

[01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:50.240]
Okay, yeah, I mean, great.

[01:50:50.460 --> 01:50:52.800]
Well, look, I mean, we're not endorsing.

[01:50:52.800 --> 01:50:55.720]
We want to do a disclaimer here that we don't have anything to do with all of these choices.

[01:50:55.960 --> 01:50:57.920]
We're embarrassed and humiliated and degraded.

[01:50:57.920 --> 01:51:01.920]
And I just buy Aureo Speedwagon, but like Bob Dylan and Springsteen are known as, but...

[01:51:02.720 --> 01:51:03.880]
It's up to you guys.

[01:51:04.020 --> 01:51:07.080]
Okay, it's up to the public out there, which is why McDonald sells so much crap.

[01:51:08.480 --> 01:51:11.800]
Here's one that says Neil, a group that I think needs to be on the list, is sublime.

[01:51:12.580 --> 01:51:12.860]
Yes.

[01:51:13.760 --> 01:51:18.400]
Their style of punk rock, Skarregae, was like no other.

[01:51:19.040 --> 01:51:19.440]
Skarregae?

[01:51:19.920 --> 01:51:20.280]
Yeah.

[01:51:20.960 --> 01:51:22.200]
What is Skarregae?

[01:51:22.280 --> 01:51:22.780]
You're a liar.

[01:51:23.880 --> 01:51:26.920]
I'm so glad I know nothing about that.

[01:51:26.920 --> 01:51:27.800]
Oh, I'm so delighted.

[01:51:28.100 --> 01:51:30.420]
The lead singer, Brad D. Noel, died of a heroin overdose.

[01:51:30.640 --> 01:51:31.120]
That's unusual.

[01:51:31.400 --> 01:51:31.840]
Yeah, man.

[01:51:32.100 --> 01:51:35.760]
Like so many great ones, originally saying, smoke to a joint of what you have the parody.

[01:51:36.260 --> 01:51:38.280]
So how about a tribute to Brad by playing it?

[01:51:38.280 --> 01:51:38.840]
We certainly will.

[01:51:38.880 --> 01:51:41.140]
Closing fire, Norma, and get syndicated.

[01:51:41.360 --> 01:51:42.820]
Do you know that that Tom Donle like us?

[01:51:42.960 --> 01:51:45.900]
Remember, he did that thing with the alleged rape victim with Kobe Bryant?

[01:51:46.100 --> 01:51:46.240]
Yes.

[01:51:46.640 --> 01:51:47.360]
Just for publicity.

[01:51:47.640 --> 01:51:50.820]
You know, he syndicated on 60 stations and he couldn't break his way out of a paper sack.

[01:51:50.820 --> 01:51:51.460]
He's so bad.

[01:51:51.920 --> 01:51:53.080]
He was on TV last night.

[01:51:53.480 --> 01:51:54.340]
Oh, no.

[01:51:54.700 --> 01:51:55.860]
Oh, the...

[01:51:55.860 --> 01:51:56.560]
Oh, the man.

[01:51:56.820 --> 01:51:58.080]
Do you have that leather jacket on?

[01:51:58.600 --> 01:51:58.880]
No.

[01:51:59.140 --> 01:52:01.360]
No, it was wearing like some nasty S30 T shirt.

[01:52:02.300 --> 01:52:03.020]
Oh, God.

[01:52:04.960 --> 01:52:05.680]
Holy crap.

[01:52:07.160 --> 01:52:08.440]
But in any rate, I just...

[01:52:08.440 --> 01:52:08.940]
I don't care.

[01:52:09.140 --> 01:52:09.860]
You know, I'm on the way out.

[01:52:10.480 --> 01:52:11.460]
I'm phasing out.

[01:52:12.100 --> 01:52:15.280]
If it wasn't for my close personal friend, Mitch Hirsch, I'd already be out, over and out.

[01:52:15.940 --> 01:52:17.100]
How about adding Rod Stewart?

[01:52:17.300 --> 01:52:20.260]
How could we forget, even though I find him repulsing and grotesque in his music and knowing,

[01:52:20.400 --> 01:52:21.140]
and it just gross.

[01:52:22.640 --> 01:52:23.840]
Says Kate, thank you, Kate.

[01:52:23.940 --> 01:52:25.060]
Rod Stewart, of course, right?

[01:52:25.060 --> 01:52:25.680]
Right on.

[01:52:25.860 --> 01:52:28.480]
Now, let me ask you, how are the doors doing now that we really...

[01:52:28.480 --> 01:52:30.740]
We stiff them, but I guess Jim won't mind.

[01:52:31.280 --> 01:52:32.060]
We stiff the doors.

[01:52:33.080 --> 01:52:34.360]
Are they moving up at all?

[01:52:36.320 --> 01:52:37.260]
Yeah, they got 11.

[01:52:38.720 --> 01:52:39.160]
See?

[01:52:39.800 --> 01:52:40.820]
They're already in double digits.

[01:52:40.980 --> 01:52:42.480]
They only been out there for a few seconds.

[01:52:42.560 --> 01:52:43.460]
About third, man.

[01:52:44.200 --> 01:52:48.880]
Stone, we're asking today the greatest rock performer, performer or group ever.

[01:52:49.660 --> 01:52:50.180]
Stone's 55.

[01:52:50.900 --> 01:52:52.420]
Celia Cruz's 52, man.

[01:52:52.420 --> 01:52:54.100]
That little little son that's going to be walking.

[01:52:54.500 --> 01:52:56.480]
That little little son that's going to be...

[01:52:56.480 --> 01:52:57.620]
She's going to win.

[01:52:58.000 --> 01:52:58.360]
I know.

[01:52:58.620 --> 01:52:59.540]
I feel it.

[01:52:59.960 --> 01:53:00.920]
I can smell it.

[01:53:01.220 --> 01:53:01.780]
Can you smell it?

[01:53:01.820 --> 01:53:02.500]
That's right there.

[01:53:03.420 --> 01:53:04.300]
Beatles 47.

[01:53:04.460 --> 01:53:05.420]
Put the sauce on it.

[01:53:05.940 --> 01:53:07.240]
It'll cover up that stench.

[01:53:08.160 --> 01:53:11.700]
Pink Floyd 26, Led Zeppelin 25, Kiss 25.

[01:53:12.740 --> 01:53:13.580]
How about Kiss?

[01:53:13.760 --> 01:53:14.840]
I want to give you a kiss.

[01:53:15.120 --> 01:53:17.120]
We're springstained 24, the Hooth 23.

[01:53:17.540 --> 01:53:18.040]
Bush 19.

[01:53:18.620 --> 01:53:19.020]
I mean, rush.

[01:53:19.200 --> 01:53:19.700]
Did I say Bush?

[01:53:19.700 --> 01:53:20.700]
Well, that's right.

[01:53:20.740 --> 01:53:22.020]
That's how many votes he got in Broward.

[01:53:23.040 --> 01:53:23.820]
Bush 19.

[01:53:24.140 --> 01:53:24.480]
Remember that?

[01:53:25.040 --> 01:53:26.680]
And then turn out to be like about two million.

[01:53:27.460 --> 01:53:32.880]
Rush 19, Bob Dylan 17, Elvis 17, Jimmy Hendricks 17, Erosmith only 13.

[01:53:33.240 --> 01:53:34.400]
What kind of crap is that?

[01:53:35.520 --> 01:53:35.920]
Comey.

[01:53:36.380 --> 01:53:37.180]
No, that's just...

[01:53:37.180 --> 01:53:39.840]
I should have voted for them because you know how obsessed I am with Erosmith.

[01:53:40.820 --> 01:53:42.720]
Doors 11, Elton John, she's got 11.

[01:53:43.080 --> 01:53:44.460]
And Van Halen, V. Heaven 10.

[01:53:45.260 --> 01:53:46.540]
So that's the ones in double digits.

[01:53:46.740 --> 01:53:46.960]
Let's see.

[01:53:47.480 --> 01:53:48.500]
We got it.

[01:53:48.540 --> 01:53:48.540]

[01:53:48.760 --> 01:53:49.340]
We got it.

[01:53:49.500 --> 01:53:49.800]
We got it.

[01:53:50.200 --> 01:53:52.840]
We got 20 more minutes of this stuff and we can get the poll finished out.

[01:53:52.880 --> 01:53:54.080]
And one to two I can take.

[01:53:54.160 --> 01:53:55.960]
And I mean, we can play our...

[01:53:56.540 --> 01:53:57.040]
Oh, seriously?

[01:53:57.780 --> 01:54:01.540]
I am so proud of myself how I did this show today with about three minutes of sleep.

[01:54:01.660 --> 01:54:02.900]
I have no idea how I did this.

[01:54:03.420 --> 01:54:03.840]
You did it.

[01:54:04.140 --> 01:54:04.140]

[01:54:04.220 --> 01:54:05.200]
Did a poll, that's how.

[01:54:06.440 --> 01:54:07.100]
What does that mean?

[01:54:07.440 --> 01:54:08.580]
We're poll building all day today.

[01:54:08.920 --> 01:54:10.400]
We are building a big poll.

[01:54:10.720 --> 01:54:10.820]
Okay.

[01:54:10.920 --> 01:54:12.960]
And there's nothing like building a big poll.

[01:54:13.380 --> 01:54:13.980]
Some of us, of course.

[01:54:14.380 --> 01:54:15.440]
A small poll will do.

[01:54:16.500 --> 01:54:18.920]
20 to 1 at 560 WQM.

[01:54:18.980 --> 01:54:22.180]
You know, when dry concepts come to my house, I always have a big smile on my push.

[01:54:22.180 --> 01:54:25.280]
And especially when they leave because my carpets, they leave looking just like brand new.

[01:54:25.380 --> 01:54:27.800]
Which is why I've been using them for over 20 to long,

[01:54:27.800 --> 01:54:30.120]
excruciating amazing years in my house.

[01:54:30.220 --> 01:54:31.060]
And they never let you down.

[01:54:31.080 --> 01:54:32.760]
They always do us to pin us on believable job.

[01:54:33.540 --> 01:54:36.880]
Dry concepts has been the number one carpet cleaning company for over 20 years in South Florida.

[01:54:37.240 --> 01:54:40.780]
And the only carpet cleaning company that actually dry cleans your carpeting.

[01:54:41.060 --> 01:54:45.260]
And now dry concepts offer as you an opportunity to say 15% on the next carpet cleaning.

[01:54:45.260 --> 01:54:52.520]
Just call dry concepts if the usual toll free number 1-800-248-5071 has to be put on their stand by list.

[01:54:52.840 --> 01:54:55.820]
And then dry concepts will call you the next time they've been opening in their schedule.

[01:54:56.100 --> 01:54:58.140]
Just like when you fly stand by, it's the same concept.

[01:54:58.460 --> 01:55:03.340]
If you're available when they have an opening, they'll lock 15% off the regular price and save you some cash this summer.

[01:55:03.700 --> 01:55:06.440]
So called dry concept today and has to be put on their stand by list.

[01:55:06.560 --> 01:55:08.740]
They might even have an opening for you on the very day that you call.

[01:55:09.060 --> 01:55:11.520]
And you'll still get that 15% off the regular price of the job.

[01:55:11.840 --> 01:55:13.800]
Don't forget, they give you a written guaranteed price upfront.

[01:55:13.800 --> 01:55:17.420]
Your carpets are drying a couple of hours. They smell like any fresh and look just like brand new.

[01:55:17.760 --> 01:55:18.680]
You can't be the one with a stick.

[01:55:18.960 --> 01:55:21.800]
Call them today and tell them that old neil told you to call dry concepts toll free.

[01:55:21.980 --> 01:55:25.300]
It's 1-800-248-5071.

[01:55:28.500 --> 01:55:30.420]
This is 420 of my city.

[01:55:30.980 --> 01:55:31.860]
You way, yeah.

[01:55:33.600 --> 01:55:34.460]
Got the job.

[01:55:34.780 --> 01:55:38.200]
Screech from Save By The Bell had his own dry out on NYPD Blue.

[01:55:39.220 --> 01:55:40.400]
Hello, I'm Andy.

[01:55:40.580 --> 01:55:42.960]
Hi, my name's Dustin Diamond.

[01:55:43.280 --> 01:55:44.740]
Where you can call me Screech.

[01:55:44.900 --> 01:55:47.880]
That was my name on Save By The Bell on your new partner.

[01:55:48.100 --> 01:55:49.140]
I don't like the sound of that.

[01:55:49.340 --> 01:55:50.680]
Oh, don't worry about it.

[01:55:50.760 --> 01:55:56.020]
By the 11th season, I was Mr. Bell's assistant principal. I'll make a great call.

[01:55:56.200 --> 01:55:57.560]
I don't think so, Aspase.

[01:55:57.740 --> 01:56:02.680]
Hey, Zach used to call me Screech-y-r-r-u. And AJ called me the Screech-in-ator.

[01:56:02.980 --> 01:56:05.220]
But I don't think I like Aspase.

[01:56:05.560 --> 01:56:07.900]
Open your mouth again and you're gonna get bitch slapped.

[01:56:07.900 --> 01:56:10.920]
Mr. Bell didn't use to protect me from bitch slappers.

[01:56:11.160 --> 01:56:13.360]
What do you do if I call him down here?

[01:56:13.520 --> 01:56:14.420]
So I'm gonna kick his ass.

[01:56:14.620 --> 01:56:16.380]
Huh? What if I call AJ?

[01:56:16.720 --> 01:56:17.620]
I'm gonna kick his ass.

[01:56:17.840 --> 01:56:19.020]
Yeah, we just be buds.

[01:56:19.260 --> 01:56:20.200]
In your dreams, pal.

[01:56:20.380 --> 01:56:21.740]
You sound very disturbed.

[01:56:22.320 --> 01:56:23.800]
Right back at you, douchebag.

[01:56:23.920 --> 01:56:25.840]
Hey, I'm not a disturbed person.

[01:56:26.080 --> 01:56:29.500]
I just played one on TV for 15 years.

[01:56:29.860 --> 01:56:31.600]
So, you're not gonna break your jaw.

[01:56:32.120 --> 01:56:33.960]
1246 is 560 WQ.

[01:56:33.960 --> 01:56:35.140]
I'm happy Tuesday to you.

[01:56:35.260 --> 01:56:36.400]
And again, we are.

[01:56:36.460 --> 01:56:37.280]
It's dumb Tuesday.

[01:56:37.280 --> 01:56:38.020]
I'm dumb.

[01:56:38.160 --> 01:56:38.620]
George is dumb.

[01:56:38.800 --> 01:56:40.300]
In Vinaibor, of course, we already knew that going in.

[01:56:40.860 --> 01:56:41.760]
Are we dumb or what?

[01:56:42.240 --> 01:56:42.560]
Dumbest.

[01:56:42.880 --> 01:56:44.180]
You know which one I'm talking about here?

[01:56:45.580 --> 01:56:45.900]
I...

[01:56:45.900 --> 01:56:47.780]
This is one of my favorite groups in the world.

[01:56:48.580 --> 01:56:51.300]
The doors was bad, but this is worse because they're gonna be here tomorrow.

[01:56:52.380 --> 01:56:53.060]
Did you know that?

[01:56:53.720 --> 01:56:54.400]
No, I didn't.

[01:56:54.600 --> 01:56:55.480]
I must have been in the promo.

[01:56:56.140 --> 01:56:56.880]
And there's Canadian A.

[01:56:56.920 --> 01:56:56.940]
And there's Canadian A.

[01:56:56.940 --> 01:56:57.300]
Guess who?

[01:56:58.660 --> 01:56:59.180]
I don't know.

[01:56:59.260 --> 01:57:00.080]
How many guesses do you give me?

[01:57:01.080 --> 01:57:01.720]
Dr. Bell.

[01:57:01.800 --> 01:57:02.060]
Third, man.

[01:57:02.860 --> 01:57:03.820]
Don't step on it.

[01:57:03.920 --> 01:57:04.520]
I would never.

[01:57:04.920 --> 01:57:04.920]

[01:57:05.160 --> 01:57:06.680]
I don't have any idea where this goes.

[01:57:06.680 --> 01:57:08.080]
First song I heard in America.

[01:57:09.840 --> 01:57:11.080]
You stepped on it.

[01:57:11.380 --> 01:57:11.920]
I thought it was...

[01:57:11.920 --> 01:57:12.400]
I thought it was...

[01:57:12.400 --> 01:57:12.980]
Well, that was...

[01:57:12.980 --> 01:57:13.240]
Prelude.

[01:57:14.060 --> 01:57:14.920]
Doesn't start yet.

[01:57:15.120 --> 01:57:16.360]
This is the one I wanted to play in.

[01:57:17.160 --> 01:57:19.460]
Like I said, this is probably the best song I ever sang.

[01:57:20.400 --> 01:57:20.840]
What's your thing?

[01:57:21.220 --> 01:57:22.920]
See, you cut the other one off before the big grunt.

[01:57:23.160 --> 01:57:23.820]
That's my favorite part.

[01:57:23.880 --> 01:57:25.080]
I don't have time for that.

[01:57:25.200 --> 01:57:26.040]
It's not a music show.

[01:57:26.200 --> 01:57:27.100]
It's always fun for a grunt.

[01:57:27.680 --> 01:57:28.040]
See an A.

[01:57:28.200 --> 01:57:28.800]
Step on it again.

[01:57:29.040 --> 01:57:29.480]
Burton comes.

[01:57:29.640 --> 01:57:31.180]
He's gonna come here and think the crap out of you.

[01:57:31.420 --> 01:57:32.000]
Is Burton coming?

[01:57:33.620 --> 01:57:34.220]
I don't know.

[01:57:34.360 --> 01:57:35.740]
It sounds like it smells like it's word.

[01:57:35.740 --> 01:57:35.900]
Burton.

[01:57:35.900 --> 01:57:35.900]

[01:57:38.860 --> 01:57:39.300]
Man.

[01:57:40.060 --> 01:57:40.280]
Man.

[01:57:41.240 --> 01:57:42.700]
I'm sorry about cheering a heavy load.

[01:57:42.920 --> 01:57:46.060]
I was gonna happen to you in any uniform now.

[01:57:47.240 --> 01:57:47.480]
Ow!

[01:57:48.800 --> 01:57:50.940]
I'll be there and shake your hand.

[01:57:51.200 --> 01:57:51.840]
We left him off.

[01:57:51.980 --> 01:57:53.200]
Well, get him on there right away, Eric.

[01:57:53.340 --> 01:57:54.320]
Immediately if not sooner.

[01:57:54.520 --> 01:57:55.620]
It's embarrassing.

[01:57:55.900 --> 01:57:57.380]
We are so pathetic.

[01:57:58.160 --> 01:57:58.740]
We're tragic.

[01:57:58.960 --> 01:58:00.580]
We want to just walk out right now.

[01:58:00.660 --> 01:58:01.260]
We didn't need the money.

[01:58:01.380 --> 01:58:01.600]
You know what?

[01:58:01.680 --> 01:58:02.640]
Between the stroke and the dope.

[01:58:03.200 --> 01:58:03.540]
Yeah.

[01:58:03.960 --> 01:58:05.700]
And my lack of sleep and the whole day.

[01:58:05.740 --> 01:58:06.980]
All the other fuzzarai.

[01:58:07.080 --> 01:58:07.780]
And stroking the dope.

[01:58:08.300 --> 01:58:09.360]
Anyway, stroke this.

[01:58:09.480 --> 01:58:11.240]
This is why not the best Canadian group of all time.

[01:58:11.360 --> 01:58:14.260]
And tomorrow's co-headliners, the guest who says RSS.

[01:58:15.580 --> 01:58:16.720]
What is it saying to bottom of that?

[01:58:16.840 --> 01:58:17.740]
I can't you cut a chopped off.

[01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:18.580]
George's one.

[01:58:19.600 --> 01:58:20.980]
You're just something man.

[01:58:22.460 --> 01:58:23.080]
Me old man.

[01:58:23.260 --> 01:58:24.060]
I can't read that in the bottom.

[01:58:24.480 --> 01:58:26.680]
Thank you very much for reminding me because that would have been.

[01:58:26.860 --> 01:58:28.500]
That would have been in Fomnia.

[01:58:29.080 --> 01:58:31.640]
It probably would have had a hitman here in a half an hour.

[01:58:32.240 --> 01:58:33.420]
Here's one that says the movie blues.

[01:58:33.560 --> 01:58:34.460]
Everybody got a thanks mark.

[01:58:34.480 --> 01:58:36.960]
I mean, got the movie blues and also Stevie Ray Vaughan.

[01:58:39.480 --> 01:58:41.900]
And was going to go see, I can't read this.

[01:58:42.080 --> 01:58:42.720]
Something about Abba.

[01:58:42.980 --> 01:58:44.540]
Oh, gonna suggest Abba but talk twice.

[01:58:44.540 --> 01:58:45.540]
No, I think Abba there.

[01:58:45.840 --> 01:58:49.700]
That show, by the way, goes on all over the world.

[01:58:49.740 --> 01:58:50.280]
Are you aware of that?

[01:58:50.520 --> 01:58:50.640]
Yeah.

[01:58:51.560 --> 01:58:52.740]
I think got to be on there.

[01:58:52.780 --> 01:58:53.920]
That show has to be on.

[01:58:53.980 --> 01:58:55.940]
There's Abba and Abba wannabe's and Abba.

[01:58:56.040 --> 01:58:57.080]
Abba, you have to Abba do.

[01:58:57.280 --> 01:58:58.140]
They're all over the place.

[01:58:58.700 --> 01:58:58.800]
Right?

[01:58:59.420 --> 01:59:00.540]
Abba, that was funny.

[01:59:00.960 --> 01:59:01.700]
No, it was not.

[01:59:01.920 --> 01:59:02.580]
I thought even...

[01:59:02.580 --> 01:59:03.760]
It wasn't even mildly amusing.

[01:59:03.980 --> 01:59:04.620]
You were hysterical.

[01:59:04.700 --> 01:59:08.880]
So this trade, maybe won't you climb on board?

[01:59:09.240 --> 01:59:10.000]
No, I don't play that.

[01:59:10.120 --> 01:59:11.700]
I mean, it's okay, but it's at his moments.

[01:59:13.920 --> 01:59:14.660]
Oh, another...

[01:59:14.660 --> 01:59:16.700]
I guess you saw him that I absolutely love.

[01:59:17.420 --> 01:59:17.640]
Love it.

[01:59:18.480 --> 01:59:20.060]
Skip the one that I absolutely love.

[01:59:20.180 --> 01:59:20.780]
Which one is that?

[01:59:20.980 --> 01:59:21.420]
No sugar.

[01:59:22.040 --> 01:59:23.060]
I mean, I don't have time.

[01:59:24.040 --> 01:59:24.480]
You crazy?

[01:59:24.920 --> 01:59:26.520]
You know how to say sugar is better though, yeah?

[01:59:26.880 --> 01:59:27.560]
I forgot.

[01:59:27.840 --> 01:59:28.240]
I know it.

[01:59:29.940 --> 01:59:32.240]
That girl is walking on that road.

[01:59:32.240 --> 01:59:33.840]
That girl is in that tunnel.

[01:59:36.880 --> 01:59:38.520]
And when all of them go to the bathroom,

[01:59:38.600 --> 01:59:39.960]
they'll go to the bathroom.

[01:59:39.960 --> 01:59:40.840]
They'll come and get ready.

[01:59:41.140 --> 01:59:41.340]
They'll come and get ready.

[01:59:44.160 --> 01:59:44.980]
I'll say one thing.

[01:59:45.080 --> 01:59:46.200]
That one is she sound like a man,

[01:59:46.200 --> 01:59:47.380]
but she couldn't sing for crap.

[01:59:48.380 --> 01:59:49.560]
She just made a lot of noise.

[01:59:51.180 --> 01:59:53.300]
Which I guess is why we call it Hootsie Cootsie, right?

[01:59:53.520 --> 01:59:54.180]
Hootsie Cootsie Mama?

[01:59:54.720 --> 01:59:55.660]
Well, Hootsie anyway.

[01:59:55.960 --> 01:59:57.500]
Not too much of the Hootsie with her, I don't think.

[01:59:57.500 --> 01:59:58.640]
Certainly no Cootsie.

[01:59:59.080 --> 02:00:01.300]
I heard she had a gigantic strap on as their mom heard,

[02:00:01.360 --> 02:00:02.600]
but I probably shouldn't mention it on the ear.

[02:00:02.640 --> 02:00:03.140]
No, that's bad.

[02:00:03.280 --> 02:00:05.720]
You shouldn't say that, because some people get very upset.

[02:00:06.180 --> 02:00:06.820]
Is that aegi?

[02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:07.240]
That's aegi?

[02:00:07.340 --> 02:00:07.660]
That's aegi?

[02:00:07.660 --> 02:00:08.040]
No, no.

[02:00:08.080 --> 02:00:10.360]
And then the next time Beener tries to start that QM van.

[02:00:11.320 --> 02:00:11.680]
Let's see.

[02:00:11.840 --> 02:00:12.340]
How many times...

[02:00:12.340 --> 02:00:14.380]
Look at that cheese right up on a mix of...

[02:00:14.380 --> 02:00:15.500]
Aston's 59.

[02:00:16.140 --> 02:00:17.400]
Celia Cruz 54.

[02:00:17.620 --> 02:00:18.500]
For good old Cecil Cruz.

[02:00:19.920 --> 02:00:20.880]
Tienes must macho.

[02:00:21.080 --> 02:00:22.960]
Celia Cruz or...

[02:00:22.960 --> 02:00:23.300]
Freddie Cruz.

[02:00:23.740 --> 02:00:24.280]
Ann Murray.

[02:00:25.040 --> 02:00:25.960]
Beatles 50.

[02:00:26.620 --> 02:00:27.300]
Kiss 27.

[02:00:27.580 --> 02:00:28.240]
Pink Floyd 27.

[02:00:28.360 --> 02:00:29.200]
Springsteen 25.

[02:00:29.340 --> 02:00:30.140]
Led Zeppelin 25.

[02:00:30.580 --> 02:00:31.540]
The Ho 24.

[02:00:32.620 --> 02:00:33.580]
Rush 19.

[02:00:33.960 --> 02:00:34.700]
Bob Dylan 19.

[02:00:35.440 --> 02:00:36.260]
Elvis 18.

[02:00:36.480 --> 02:00:37.160]
Jimmy Henry 17.

[02:00:37.300 --> 02:00:38.060]
The doors 14.

[02:00:38.420 --> 02:00:39.120]
Thank goodness they're moving.

[02:00:39.440 --> 02:00:40.260]
They're sliding it up there.

[02:00:40.820 --> 02:00:41.960]
Sliding it up to the other side.

[02:00:42.340 --> 02:00:43.440]
Aerosmith 13.

[02:00:43.880 --> 02:00:44.740]
Grateful dead 12.

[02:00:45.180 --> 02:00:46.220]
The dirty dozen Elton John.

[02:00:46.300 --> 02:00:47.000]
It doesn't.

[02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:47.900]
Van Halen 11.

[02:00:48.140 --> 02:00:50.280]
And then after that, single digits, including a...

[02:00:50.280 --> 02:00:51.420]
Billy Joel with Elaine Yine.

[02:00:51.780 --> 02:00:52.520]
Please, please, me a lot.

[02:00:52.520 --> 02:00:56.660]
This is another disgusting story you keep feeding me these damn things it's awful.

[02:00:56.900 --> 02:00:57.560]
Now I'm a troublemaker.

[02:00:58.220 --> 02:00:59.280]
Just making these up.

[02:00:59.640 --> 02:01:00.400]
Sacramento, California.

[02:01:01.100 --> 02:01:05.680]
Four lawsuits filed to California claimed to hope his witnesses officials have been covering up alleged sex abuse of children.

[02:01:06.100 --> 02:01:09.180]
But congregation leaders adding to a series of similar suits nationwide.

[02:01:09.380 --> 02:01:09.840]
All right.

[02:01:10.500 --> 02:01:13.240]
The law firms involved in the suits filed last week in three northern California.

[02:01:13.640 --> 02:01:16.700]
Counties are holding public meetings this week in search of more victims and witnesses.

[02:01:17.660 --> 02:01:21.880]
It's a widespread problem and nothing's been done about it to protect these children to protect future children.

[02:01:21.880 --> 02:01:26.840]
And said, Bill Breesburg, one of the Sacramento attorneys who filed four lawsuits in California last Thursday.

[02:01:27.360 --> 02:01:29.960]
Once the church leaders knew about it, they didn't do a damn thing to stuff.

[02:01:30.200 --> 02:01:31.120]
Sounds familiar, don't it?

[02:01:31.240 --> 02:01:33.360]
Just like our good friends at the Cantler Church.

[02:01:36.100 --> 02:01:38.860]
By the way, I did do some investigative work all the sex with time.

[02:01:38.940 --> 02:01:41.640]
I've had off and been putting bits in the VCS.

[02:01:42.300 --> 02:01:45.000]
I did do some investigation, you know how many straight priests there are in the world.

[02:01:45.080 --> 02:01:45.520]
Yeah, I...

[02:01:45.520 --> 02:01:46.200]
That's what I found out.

[02:01:47.800 --> 02:01:50.920]
And one of them was Father Marin who went with us no more so I guess eight.

[02:01:52.040 --> 02:01:53.600]
And what was the other...what was his name?

[02:01:54.900 --> 02:01:56.160]
Oh, Father Pernoy.

[02:01:56.740 --> 02:02:00.560]
Yeah, he was Father Pernoy. He was also Father. That's good. That's his name.

[02:02:00.680 --> 02:02:02.800]
Oh, I know. He's dead. Yeah.

[02:02:03.320 --> 02:02:05.140]
What a shame. Father Karris. No.

[02:02:05.680 --> 02:02:07.980]
Thank you. That would have kept me up all night.

[02:02:08.240 --> 02:02:08.840]
Alex Karris.

[02:02:08.920 --> 02:02:11.200]
That's the power of Christ to pay you.

[02:02:11.340 --> 02:02:14.460]
Oh! The power of Christ to pay you.

[02:02:17.440 --> 02:02:20.160]
Okay, it's enough. Like I told you, we don't have time for all that stuff.

[02:02:20.160 --> 02:02:21.360]
Is that angry? Is that coming?

[02:02:21.800 --> 02:02:23.860]
No. Is that angry? Is that the bow?

[02:02:26.140 --> 02:02:29.860]
It was coming from the other side, man. I'm sorry. Watch it.

[02:02:30.040 --> 02:02:31.700]
She's breaking on through from the other side.

[02:02:31.780 --> 02:02:34.180]
The spirits? She's breaking back on through from the other side.

[02:02:34.900 --> 02:02:36.160]
She's trying to make it come back.

[02:02:37.480 --> 02:02:39.500]
Anyway, here's a...did I do this sublime thing?

[02:02:39.600 --> 02:02:40.920]
Oh yeah, I got...I love today.

[02:02:41.160 --> 02:02:41.800]
No, it's going on.

[02:02:41.800 --> 02:02:44.960]
I don't either. I'm an incoherent and we're having a great show as a result.

[02:02:45.220 --> 02:02:47.560]
I guess I should never sleep. We'd have a great show every day ago.

[02:02:48.120 --> 02:02:48.920]
Like rumor.

[02:02:50.660 --> 02:02:52.620]
Stone's 59, Celia 55.

[02:02:52.840 --> 02:02:55.860]
I'm guarantee I have all the confidence in the world. He's going to pull it ahead.

[02:02:56.660 --> 02:02:57.300]
WDQA, hello.

[02:02:58.220 --> 02:02:59.100]
Hi, how you doing?

[02:02:59.520 --> 02:03:00.220]
Pretty good. How you doing?

[02:03:00.820 --> 02:03:01.120]
P-T.

[02:03:01.760 --> 02:03:03.580]
We haven't a Zixi chick longer yet?

[02:03:04.080 --> 02:03:05.860]
Zixi chick. So let's get him on right away.

[02:03:06.260 --> 02:03:07.400]
The European version.

[02:03:08.820 --> 02:03:10.200]
Okay, pal. What are you saying?

[02:03:10.640 --> 02:03:11.120]
That was that, huh?

[02:03:11.760 --> 02:03:12.500]
That was my guy.

[02:03:13.760 --> 02:03:14.480]
Yeah, European.

[02:03:16.320 --> 02:03:16.680]
5670560.

[02:03:16.880 --> 02:03:17.680]
And 0.560.

[02:03:18.760 --> 02:03:21.840]
I'm the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line. WDQA, hello.

[02:03:22.720 --> 02:03:23.120]
Oh, Neil.

[02:03:23.520 --> 02:03:24.560]
Yes, sir. How about Chicago?

[02:03:25.380 --> 02:03:27.740]
Oh, my God. Another one of my all-time favorite groups.

[02:03:27.880 --> 02:03:29.740]
I feel like I'm an idiot today and I'm probably am.

[02:03:30.160 --> 02:03:30.760]
Okay, thank you.

[02:03:30.860 --> 02:03:31.280]
Thanks, pal.

[02:03:31.820 --> 02:03:32.180]
Chicago.

[02:03:32.500 --> 02:03:35.500]
And also I got some of that here too, which I know gets you upset.

[02:03:36.440 --> 02:03:36.880]
Sure does.

[02:03:37.320 --> 02:03:38.220]
You don't want Chicago?

[02:03:38.480 --> 02:03:39.280]
I want Chicago a lot.

[02:03:39.540 --> 02:03:40.160]
The older, the better.

[02:03:40.940 --> 02:03:43.940]
Old days, Saturday and the park, all of these things.

[02:03:44.340 --> 02:03:46.080]
Well, how about a bar, if you would?

[02:03:52.640 --> 02:03:55.600]
Yeah, what do I think about it?

[02:03:56.620 --> 02:03:58.380]
Get that right, we am all for it, man.

[02:03:58.540 --> 02:03:59.620]
Don't be stepping on poor serious.

[02:03:59.740 --> 02:04:00.760]
He's got enough tourists already.

[02:04:02.120 --> 02:04:04.880]
Well, I guess that's a bonus because we get here a few clips here,

[02:04:04.920 --> 02:04:05.760]
which of course blows off.

[02:04:05.840 --> 02:04:07.580]
No, the fact that we left these people on.

[02:04:08.200 --> 02:04:09.000]
Oh, there we go.

[02:04:10.400 --> 02:04:11.160]
My goodness.

[02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:15.260]
How is Terry Cat doing?

[02:04:15.720 --> 02:04:15.820]
Oh.

[02:04:22.120 --> 02:04:23.920]
Okay, but again, we're talking about performers.

[02:04:23.920 --> 02:04:24.780]
Keep that in mind.

[02:04:24.940 --> 02:04:27.680]
Just keep that in the before you cast your all-important vote.

[02:04:28.300 --> 02:04:29.640]
We're talking performers.

[02:04:30.300 --> 02:04:34.200]
Onstage, people like to really sing and perform as opposed to like in the studio.

[02:04:34.720 --> 02:04:36.040]
Like for real, in front of an audience.

[02:04:36.700 --> 02:04:40.000]
And entertain and amuse the new ladies and jump up and down and scratch through it.

[02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:40.640]
That's the fuck that.

[02:04:44.480 --> 02:04:47.980]
We got somebody at QM, those about scratching his ass by the way.

[02:04:53.620 --> 02:04:54.100]
I don't know.

[02:04:55.180 --> 02:04:55.180]

[02:04:55.960 --> 02:04:55.960]

[02:04:56.300 --> 02:04:56.640]
I don't know.

[02:04:57.300 --> 02:04:57.500]
I don't know.

[02:04:58.500 --> 02:05:00.040]
Wouldn't that have been a hell of a combo?

[02:05:00.360 --> 02:05:01.220]
Celia Cruz and Chicago.

[02:05:01.300 --> 02:05:02.300]
That would have taken her up.

[02:05:02.520 --> 02:05:02.880]
Dynamite.

[02:05:03.700 --> 02:05:05.300]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[02:05:05.500 --> 02:05:08.000]
Pound 5, 60 on the 18 team for Ryzen Wireless Land.

[02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:09.360]
We got that big one or two hour coming up.

[02:05:09.400 --> 02:05:10.380]
And then we got Joe Rose.

[02:05:10.500 --> 02:05:14.020]
We got a rip Mo and Asperger two hours between two and four rhymes with Mo.

[02:05:14.620 --> 02:05:17.640]
Joe Zaganki also rhymes with Joe and Mo and Joe.

[02:05:18.260 --> 02:05:19.500]
Zaganki filling it for the Humper at four.

[02:05:19.620 --> 02:05:21.840]
And then we got the Marlins and the Arizona Diamondback.

[02:05:22.180 --> 02:05:24.260]
You've got to do better than 10,000 people people.

[02:05:25.540 --> 02:05:27.100]
The team is hot as a pistol.

[02:05:27.720 --> 02:05:29.640]
For all's trying to get the entire town to work up.

[02:05:29.680 --> 02:05:30.240]
They were frenzy.

[02:05:30.320 --> 02:05:31.640]
All the way to notice he's given up, I think.

[02:05:32.180 --> 02:05:34.020]
And they're only one game out of a wild card.

[02:05:34.180 --> 02:05:35.840]
They got 10,000 people there last night.

[02:05:35.840 --> 02:05:38.120]
And they're playing Arizona, which is one of the two teams right now.

[02:05:38.520 --> 02:05:40.880]
They're battling for that wild card deal along with the Phillies.

[02:05:41.480 --> 02:05:44.020]
And he came to the baseball game and he lowly rated Joe and Mark overnight.

[02:05:44.020 --> 02:05:47.280]
I said that was great to this May, you know, because they're good guys, especially Joe.

[02:05:47.480 --> 02:05:48.180]
I mean, Mark, yeah.

[02:05:48.560 --> 02:05:49.780]
But horrible.

[02:05:50.420 --> 02:05:51.600]
What are we going to do about that?

[02:05:52.720 --> 02:05:53.240]
I don't know.

[02:05:53.660 --> 02:05:54.740]
I blame you for that.

[02:05:55.160 --> 02:05:58.240]
It is like, because Joe is trying to be like another, you know,

[02:05:58.340 --> 02:06:01.840]
with eating ass and big racks and packages.

[02:06:02.700 --> 02:06:03.680]
He's trying to do that stuff.

[02:06:04.860 --> 02:06:06.460]
Talk about something real intellectual.

[02:06:06.700 --> 02:06:09.100]
Talk about some heavy-duty stuff, Joe, about solving the problems of the world.

[02:06:09.200 --> 02:06:11.680]
Because all the people that are up overnight are like in some of the acts,

[02:06:11.780 --> 02:06:12.840]
they're much in neurotic assholes.

[02:06:13.300 --> 02:06:15.300]
They don't know from racks and packages and stuff.

[02:06:15.400 --> 02:06:16.580]
They don't even know what they're talking about.

[02:06:17.500 --> 02:06:19.420]
What are we going to do to improve the Joe and Mark show?

[02:06:20.640 --> 02:06:21.280]
Ignore it.

[02:06:22.940 --> 02:06:23.580]
New hosts.

[02:06:24.040 --> 02:06:24.820]
Now come on, that's bad.

[02:06:25.060 --> 02:06:25.320]
Very bad.

[02:06:25.520 --> 02:06:28.620]
In fact, maybe Mo, if we move Mojo in the time slot.

[02:06:29.160 --> 02:06:29.540]
Not bad.

[02:06:29.820 --> 02:06:30.480]
They can switch the water.

[02:06:30.740 --> 02:06:32.600]
What are we leaving you, folks, when we leave it,

[02:06:32.600 --> 02:06:37.200]
your capable hands now, the greatest rock performer or performers of all time,

[02:06:37.440 --> 02:06:44.340]
Stone 60, Celia Cruz, 56, Beatles 51,

[02:06:45.240 --> 02:06:45.860]
Cinque d'uno,

[02:06:47.160 --> 02:06:51.980]
Kiss 28, Pink Floyd 28, Led Zeppelin 26, Bruce Springsteen 25,

[02:06:52.220 --> 02:06:56.280]
the who 24, Bill and 22, Rush 19, Rush will be here tomorrow too, by the way.

[02:06:56.280 --> 02:06:56.760]
I mentioned it.

[02:06:56.840 --> 02:06:56.940]
Yes.

[02:06:57.220 --> 02:07:01.720]
Elvis 19, the grateful dead 17, Jimmy Hendrix 17.

[02:07:02.960 --> 02:07:06.680]
I'm in local, your sports radio 560, Celia.

[02:07:07.060 --> 02:07:07.540]
Celia.

[02:07:09.520 --> 02:07:11.560]
Oh, this is Pope John Paulins.

[02:07:11.920 --> 02:07:15.780]
And if he asks me, the only thing more fun than playing Grandass with a Swiss guy

[02:07:15.780 --> 02:07:17.040]
is the Neil Rogers.

[02:07:17.160 --> 02:07:17.660]
One to two.

[02:07:17.740 --> 02:07:17.980]
Power.

[02:07:18.260 --> 02:07:18.560]
Oh.

[02:07:19.760 --> 02:07:22.140]
Surely you've got all the Harry Potter books.

[02:07:22.280 --> 02:07:24.560]
And you've got the Harry Potter homespunectomy kit.

[02:07:24.680 --> 02:07:28.180]
But now you've got to get the Harry Potter pet prodsology kit.

[02:07:28.300 --> 02:07:29.520]
Man, that please great.

[02:07:29.520 --> 02:07:30.660]
Check out your cat.

[02:07:30.780 --> 02:07:31.520]
Oh, shit.

[02:07:33.020 --> 02:07:33.880]
Oh, crocodile.

[02:07:34.600 --> 02:07:35.140]
Five of it.

[02:07:35.540 --> 02:07:36.160]
Hey, hey, hey.

[02:07:36.200 --> 02:07:38.220]
The Harry Potter pet prodsology kit.

[02:07:38.300 --> 02:07:39.640]
Barnyard Edition sold separately.

[02:07:40.060 --> 02:07:40.300]
Wow.

[02:07:40.480 --> 02:07:42.460]
How did my hot wheels car get inside a missing?

[02:07:43.980 --> 02:07:45.700]
Meg my tricycle.

[02:07:51.240 --> 02:07:55.620]
This month on ABC, get ready for all new blue.

[02:07:56.080 --> 02:07:58.200]
And more out of work child actors.

[02:07:58.200 --> 02:07:59.900]
Andy Cifuets new partner.

[02:08:00.300 --> 02:08:01.880]
Zach from Save by the Bell.

[02:08:02.180 --> 02:08:03.320]
Dies in week three.

[02:08:03.600 --> 02:08:07.340]
Only to be replaced by Screech from Save by the Bell.

[02:08:07.600 --> 02:08:09.220]
Andy, don't hand that drink.

[02:08:09.600 --> 02:08:11.140]
I'll show it to the bell, please.

[02:08:11.460 --> 02:08:15.820]
Then Screech has a run in with new lieutenant, Larry Bud Melman.

[02:08:16.080 --> 02:08:17.980]
Hi, I'm I drunk.

[02:08:18.380 --> 02:08:21.820]
In week five, meet the new team of top cops.

[02:08:22.180 --> 02:08:25.180]
George W. Bush and William Jefferson Clinton.

[02:08:25.500 --> 02:08:26.420]
I love you, Harlem.

[02:08:26.640 --> 02:08:27.620]
And I don't have interest.

[02:08:27.620 --> 02:08:33.380]
And in week seven, Fred Rerunberry takes the role of Sergeant Scusey from Internal Affairs.

[02:08:33.680 --> 02:08:34.720]
Hi, hi, hi, hi.

[02:08:34.920 --> 02:08:40.020]
All new blue with all old actors this month on ABC.

[02:08:40.740 --> 02:08:43.600]
My fellow Americans, we have entered a new era.

[02:08:44.180 --> 02:08:49.320]
And this new era requires new responsibilities both for the government and for our people.

[02:08:50.360 --> 02:08:55.720]
And realize that for the first time ever, we do not believe women should be educated

[02:08:55.720 --> 02:08:59.360]
or should have health care or should leave their homes.

[02:09:02.180 --> 02:09:09.140]
People are going about their daily lives, working and shopping and playing as shallow materialistic consumers

[02:09:09.140 --> 02:09:12.060]
who care only about getting rich or getting ahead.

[02:09:12.760 --> 02:09:13.880]
And this is good for America.

[02:09:16.640 --> 02:09:21.500]
I'm encouraging school children to kill all Americans and we will prevail.

[02:09:21.500 --> 02:09:22.820]
Good riddance.

[02:09:26.500 --> 02:09:32.280]
Tonight on Action News, Britney's new CD, it might be a bit too much for your young team.

[02:09:41.980 --> 02:09:43.500]
This is retarded.

[02:09:43.820 --> 02:09:46.540]
No, I was just going to stand on that level that we're not fucking now.

[02:10:14.360 --> 02:10:15.700]
Why hate hate?

[02:10:15.700 --> 02:10:17.580]
Unless of course it's my own.

[02:10:18.520 --> 02:10:19.800]
I am Republican.

[02:10:20.640 --> 02:10:22.360]

A bad economy is a good thing.

[02:10:43.240 --> 02:10:45.640]
I am a Republican.

[02:10:46.260 --> 02:10:48.940]
I support an unprovoked war against Iraq.

[02:10:49.320 --> 02:10:55.900]
Not only because I'm ordered to do so, but I believe exploiting the deaths of 3000 Americans is good for business.

[02:10:56.540 --> 02:10:57.900]
I am a Republican.

[02:10:58.500 --> 02:11:01.360]
I am proud to have ex-cons running my government.

[02:11:01.880 --> 02:11:04.280]
I know they will never come for me.

[02:11:04.900 --> 02:11:06.780]
Or I have nothing to hide.

[02:11:07.520 --> 02:11:09.360]

And you will know me.

[02:11:27.860 --> 02:11:34.860]
That will be me in the leatherhead cover being led around the fetish club naked by a leash.

[02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:38.980]
Oh God, I love that.

[02:11:39.340 --> 02:11:46.180]
It's like the end of the pile of the scarlet campers in the ladies room.

[02:11:48.680 --> 02:11:50.320]
Yes, sir.

[02:11:51.260 --> 02:11:53.900]

You make me your slave.

[02:12:03.540 --> 02:12:04.500]
Mm-hmm.

[02:12:04.800 --> 02:12:05.260]
Right.

[02:12:06.020 --> 02:12:06.400]
Right.

[02:12:08.420 --> 02:12:08.780]
Right.

[02:12:09.160 --> 02:12:09.260]
Right.

[02:12:09.260 --> 02:12:09.260]

[02:12:09.920 --> 02:12:09.920]

[02:12:16.140 --> 02:12:18.320]
Don't be fooled by the rocks in my pants.

[02:12:18.620 --> 02:12:20.680]
I'm busy with the big fat potterrican.

[02:12:21.160 --> 02:12:22.880]
I got a secret you may not understand.

[02:12:23.440 --> 02:12:24.340]
I'll bet you didn't know.

[02:12:24.500 --> 02:12:25.440]
I'm really a man.

[02:12:25.780 --> 02:12:27.860]
I shake, leap, weather, eat, and bully all jack.

[02:12:27.860 --> 02:12:30.340]
But I'm still known as the girl from the block.

[02:12:30.820 --> 02:12:32.380]
Hornin' men want me a lot.

[02:12:32.920 --> 02:12:34.800]
But very little know that I have a thing.

[02:12:35.160 --> 02:12:38.220]
I started dressing like this in my teens.

[02:12:38.560 --> 02:12:39.720]
Dressing like a book of queen.

[02:12:40.200 --> 02:12:42.580]
With just some collagen and silicone teats.

[02:12:43.040 --> 02:12:45.240]
My body's well rounded.

[02:12:45.700 --> 02:12:47.620]
Like I told you, I'm a manly man.

[02:12:48.140 --> 02:12:49.980]
That's not footage cheese on my can.

[02:12:50.440 --> 02:12:52.320]
I got my knee back there in the jam.

[02:12:52.760 --> 02:12:53.580]
My hair is real.

[02:12:54.040 --> 02:12:54.860]
Give it a squeeze.

[02:12:55.880 --> 02:12:57.080]
And my hair too.

[02:12:57.340 --> 02:12:59.460]
I do a better cap on the feminine vice.

[02:12:59.740 --> 02:13:00.580]
But I got a little cold.

[02:13:01.100 --> 02:13:02.380]
So I don't have a choice.

[02:13:04.480 --> 02:13:06.820]
I like the surprise in the eyes of the boys.

[02:13:07.100 --> 02:13:09.380]
When they get a load of eye on circumcised toy.

[02:13:09.600 --> 02:13:11.760]
Nothing else is falling, no harmonies.

[02:13:12.080 --> 02:13:14.020]
But under my clothes, the rest is me.

[02:13:14.560 --> 02:13:16.360]
Don't be fooled by the rocks in my pants.

[02:13:16.780 --> 02:13:18.840]
I'm busy with the big fat potterrican.

[02:13:19.200 --> 02:13:21.040]
I got a secret you may not understand.

[02:13:21.600 --> 02:13:22.460]
I'll bet you didn't know.

[02:13:22.460 --> 02:13:23.680]
I'm really a man.

[02:13:23.940 --> 02:13:26.160]
A shady buttery skin, a whole little jock.

[02:13:26.400 --> 02:13:28.360]
But I'm still known as the girl from the block.

[02:13:28.860 --> 02:13:30.700]
Hornet night what me a lot.

[02:13:31.140 --> 02:13:33.360]
But very easy to know that I have a big crew.

[02:13:33.360 --> 02:13:33.900]
Wait a minute.

[02:13:34.980 --> 02:13:39.660]
Coming up tonight, on inside the behind the true Hollywood celebrity music biography profile

[02:13:39.660 --> 02:13:40.180]
story.

[02:13:40.660 --> 02:13:43.840]
We take a good, hard stiff look and to start up.

[02:13:44.540 --> 02:13:47.340]
They succeeded with an upbeat tone about pulling through.

[02:13:47.740 --> 02:13:49.200]
Just when you think you're going to fail.

[02:13:49.740 --> 02:13:50.640]
Then they failed.

[02:13:50.640 --> 02:13:53.400]
They were swing out sister.

[02:14:00.980 --> 02:14:06.380]
You know, we still get mail from people about how our song changed their lives.

[02:14:06.700 --> 02:14:11.500]
Lying through her teeth, swing out sisters Corrine Vluery lives in a sewer of denial.

[02:14:11.960 --> 02:14:16.500]
Refusing to face the fact that her happy little song did f*** all to get her anywhere.

[02:14:16.660 --> 02:14:18.220]
I'm sorry for Corrine, myself.

[02:14:18.880 --> 02:14:20.080]
I've come to terms with it.

[02:14:20.080 --> 02:14:24.980]
Corrine's bandmate Andy Carnall visits her often at their home.

[02:14:25.200 --> 02:14:32.380]
I mean, I've accepted the fact that we were a f***ing band who didn't deserve more than one hit record.

[02:14:32.540 --> 02:14:32.780]
No!

[02:14:33.180 --> 02:14:34.120]
We suck, baby.

[02:14:34.320 --> 02:14:34.900]
We're irrelevant.

[02:14:35.180 --> 02:14:36.520]
No, no, no.

[02:14:36.920 --> 02:14:37.680]
Don't stop.

[02:14:38.240 --> 02:14:39.000]
To ask.

[02:14:39.360 --> 02:14:42.180]
Now you found a break to make it last.

[02:14:42.220 --> 02:14:43.140]
Oh, we're lame.

[02:14:43.400 --> 02:14:44.140]
Break out.

[02:14:45.600 --> 02:14:48.220]
Come on, sing with me now, Andy, please.

If you love me, sing with me.

[02:14:51.540 --> 02:14:52.440]
Oh, God!

[02:14:52.640 --> 02:14:53.480]
Come on, go start.

[02:14:54.280 --> 02:14:55.320]
To ask.

[02:14:56.020 --> 02:14:58.660]
Now you found a break to make it last.

[02:14:59.200 --> 02:15:02.720]
You've got to find a way, say what you want to say.

[02:15:03.100 --> 02:15:04.020]
Swing out sister.

[02:15:04.800 --> 02:15:07.700]
You can't run a puke, but that's what makes great television.

[02:15:08.480 --> 02:15:13.140]
It's a big juicy, something went look at your business tonight, on Inside the Bind.

[02:15:20.260 --> 02:15:23.260]
even though anyone with an IQ over four can see it's not.

[02:15:23.320 --> 02:15:31.120]
It's Fox News, with a powerful, prime time lineup so powerful that we're gonna keep repeating the word powerful as much as possible.

[02:15:31.260 --> 02:15:32.980]
First at eight, it's the O'Reilly back here.

[02:15:36.500 --> 02:15:37.840]
Well, Bill, if I could just say that.

[02:15:37.860 --> 02:15:38.600]
Oh, no, you don't.

[02:15:38.780 --> 02:15:39.940]
I'm not thinking the way with that.

[02:15:39.940 --> 02:15:43.440]
Then at nine, it's more debatable debate on Fox News.

[02:15:43.640 --> 02:15:46.740]

Fox News presents the edge with Paulazon.

[02:15:58.500 --> 02:16:01.660]

Well, I don't know how you're doing on yours.

[02:30:33.600 --> 02:30:37.020]
The WWWF City Dance Slapdown

[02:30:37.600 --> 02:30:40.260]
We'll be ashamed now, not get off

[02:30:40.260 --> 02:30:42.620]
We'll be ashamed now, not get off

[02:30:42.620 --> 02:30:43.040]
We'll be ashamed now, not get off

[02:30:43.040 --> 02:30:48.320]
And school in the world's weakest and geekiest claim the title of world's biggest city

[02:30:48.320 --> 02:30:50.520]
No, I'll pay

[02:30:50.520 --> 02:30:52.620]
I'll pay the end of punishment

[02:30:52.620 --> 02:30:55.160]
No, the accusation

[02:30:55.160 --> 02:30:56.680]
I'm telling my dad

[02:30:56.680 --> 02:30:58.500]
I'm telling my dad

[02:30:59.600 --> 02:31:00.800]
I'm telling my mom

[02:31:02.760 --> 02:31:06.880]
It's the WWWF City Dance Slapdown

[02:31:06.880 --> 02:31:09.900]
Who will claim the title and rule?

[02:31:11.140 --> 02:31:13.920]
Find out this Saturday night on ESPN

[02:31:14.800 --> 02:31:19.200]
He likes to set up color people

[02:31:19.200 --> 02:31:20.160]
Here

[02:31:22.060 --> 02:31:26.980]
He likes to frame the color people

[02:31:27.960 --> 02:31:29.300]
Are you sure?

[02:31:34.900 --> 02:31:36.200]
Do you hear this?

[02:31:36.440 --> 02:31:36.580]
Yeah

[02:31:37.700 --> 02:31:39.000]
It's like a Beatles song

[02:31:41.700 --> 02:31:43.020]
There's a channel missing

[02:31:44.360 --> 02:31:46.420]
I think it's because of the way you want

[02:31:46.420 --> 02:31:49.080]
Your board, this board or the boat

[02:31:49.620 --> 02:31:51.340]
I love it

[02:31:52.900 --> 02:31:54.620]
I can't wrap some of the sea of cruising

[02:31:54.620 --> 02:31:55.520]
There's a lot there

[02:31:55.520 --> 02:31:58.180]
All the summer for men

[02:31:58.180 --> 02:32:01.300]
They drop the bloody blood

[02:32:05.580 --> 02:32:07.020]
All right

[02:32:07.020 --> 02:32:08.300]
This is the best

[02:32:09.340 --> 02:32:10.780]
Is that a good idea?

[02:32:13.700 --> 02:32:14.900]
What's the spit cause?

[02:32:15.780 --> 02:32:16.800]
Officer for men

[02:32:24.280 --> 02:32:25.360]
He played out the city

[02:32:26.140 --> 02:32:27.900]
No, I'm playing it off the DCS

[02:32:27.900 --> 02:32:29.740]
I dubbed it

[02:32:29.740 --> 02:32:31.300]
Here board's only W1 Channel

[02:32:35.200 --> 02:32:35.560]
Wrong

[02:32:36.480 --> 02:32:37.380]
The hook is what?

[02:32:37.600 --> 02:32:38.000]
There's the proof

[02:32:39.580 --> 02:32:40.240]
Oh, it's here

[02:32:40.240 --> 02:32:40.960]
This one, okay

[02:32:43.300 --> 02:32:44.440]
No, it would make a difference

[02:32:44.440 --> 02:32:46.240]
It must be trackings

[02:32:46.240 --> 02:32:46.780]
It actually has a lot of things

[02:32:46.780 --> 02:32:46.780]

[02:32:46.780 --> 02:32:47.860]
It's gonna be separated in it

[02:32:47.860 --> 02:32:48.600]
That one good

[02:32:52.720 --> 02:32:54.080]
What happened again?

[02:33:00.860 --> 02:33:01.580]
Oh, Jay

[02:33:02.260 --> 02:33:03.800]
I think you did it

[02:33:06.780 --> 02:33:09.600]
But I want to know for sure

[02:33:10.920 --> 02:33:12.340]
You should be able to believe that

[02:33:12.340 --> 02:33:14.640]
If you like to play golf at 10 o'clock at night

[02:33:16.120 --> 02:33:17.340]
You wouldn't know what I think

[02:33:17.340 --> 02:33:19.140]
I think you're gonna get passed around

[02:33:19.140 --> 02:33:21.060]
Like my son is at the end of the ride

[02:33:22.200 --> 02:33:23.200]
You slide

[02:33:25.440 --> 02:33:27.300]
You'll get the power to fall

[02:33:27.300 --> 02:33:28.940]
You are

[02:33:32.300 --> 02:33:33.040]
You are

[02:33:33.040 --> 02:33:33.780]
You are best

[02:33:33.780 --> 02:33:37.000]
You are best

[02:33:37.000 --> 02:33:37.480]
You are best

[02:33:37.480 --> 02:33:37.840]
You are best

[02:33:37.840 --> 02:33:44.620]
You are best

[02:33:45.680 --> 02:33:47.700]
Everyone had enough OZ coverage

[02:33:47.700 --> 02:33:49.020]
Their lives

[02:33:49.020 --> 02:33:51.380]
Me, you, nobody cares anymore

[02:33:51.380 --> 02:33:53.420]
And no, Jay, just sitting there

[02:33:53.420 --> 02:33:54.680]
Looking bored

[02:33:54.680 --> 02:33:58.140]
Spending $200,000 an hour on legal fees

[02:33:58.920 --> 02:34:00.060]
I'm not impressed

[02:34:00.060 --> 02:34:02.800]
I just want to laugh my day back

[02:34:02.800 --> 02:34:05.880]
Get off my day back

[02:34:08.460 --> 02:34:09.720]
Oh, Jay

[02:34:12.240 --> 02:34:13.600]
Oh, Jay

[02:34:13.600 --> 02:34:14.520]
Nobody used to the silver

[02:34:14.520 --> 02:34:16.520]
Phone 20p, make my ass

[02:34:16.520 --> 02:34:17.580]
Come on

[02:34:19.240 --> 02:34:21.540]
How much did you pay for all of that?

[02:34:23.780 --> 02:34:25.160]
Now you're going to hell

[02:34:25.160 --> 02:34:27.420]
And some loser named Kato has a career

[02:34:29.500 --> 02:34:30.780]
You make my turn

[02:34:30.780 --> 02:34:31.840]
Look like a boss

[02:34:32.760 --> 02:34:33.340]
Wow

[02:34:34.300 --> 02:34:34.880]
Wow

[02:34:38.520 --> 02:34:39.680]
Come on

[02:34:39.680 --> 02:34:40.760]
Get the power

[02:34:40.760 --> 02:34:41.700]
My say-say

[02:34:41.700 --> 02:34:43.780]
My say-say-say

[02:34:43.780 --> 02:34:45.040]
My say-say-say

[02:34:45.040 --> 02:34:45.840]
You'll get a nade withITE

[02:34:45.840 --> 02:34:45.860]
What, inspired me like bar spoon?

[02:34:45.860 --> 02:34:46.940]
Alright, you will get a big, skirt simple compromise

[02:34:46.940 --> 02:34:49.700]
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my love

[02:34:49.700 --> 02:35:00.400]
Who's he, who's he, who is he?

[02:35:01.240 --> 02:35:05.680]
Well, not sure

[02:35:05.680 --> 02:35:05.700]
Now what, he got you

[02:35:05.700 --> 02:35:09.300]
Let me tell you

[02:35:09.300 --> 02:35:09.420]
that you liked水

[02:35:09.420 --> 02:35:10.080]
in your dreams

[02:35:10.080 --> 02:35:12.080]
Oh, Jay was soon to be free

[02:35:13.640 --> 02:35:18.080]
Watching every day on the TV try the other days are here crack a smile

[02:35:18.080 --> 02:35:22.920]
Waiting for the motion for the big mistrips when humans are the country doing a big high five years walking

[02:35:23.480 --> 02:35:25.140]
Thanks to see I'm talking

[02:35:25.140 --> 02:35:29.380]
Oh Jay be doing in the huby right back. Oh, hey, he's seen

[02:35:31.960 --> 02:35:32.400]
You

[02:35:38.320 --> 02:35:43.140]
Welcome back, baby's days Monday night football. We're proud of back with us an old friend just

[02:35:45.180 --> 02:35:48.960]
Listen, we're we're sorry about some of those jokes the Buffalo Civil Range thing

[02:35:48.960 --> 02:35:50.260]
I don't want to wait a lot

[02:35:50.940 --> 02:35:52.100]
How's that doing in a car tree?

[02:35:59.380 --> 02:36:01.300]
Well

[02:36:17.140 --> 02:36:17.380]
Oh

[02:36:29.380 --> 02:36:29.720]
The

[02:36:32.580 --> 02:36:33.060]
night.

[02:36:33.060 --> 02:36:35.300]
I told you don't bother me while I'm in here.

[02:36:35.400 --> 02:36:37.120]
I said hello.

[02:36:37.420 --> 02:36:38.640]
It's Mickey Mouse.

[02:36:39.220 --> 02:36:40.360]
Oh, Mr. Mouse.

[02:36:40.520 --> 02:36:41.000]
Good morning.

[02:36:41.120 --> 02:36:41.780]
How are you?

[02:36:41.980 --> 02:36:44.640]
What the hell are you doing to me?

[02:36:45.580 --> 02:36:46.400]
Nothing, sir.

[02:36:46.580 --> 02:36:48.080]
You're freaking killing me.

[02:36:48.240 --> 02:36:48.900]
No, I'm not.

[02:36:49.020 --> 02:36:51.440]
I got David Kelly calling me every three minutes.

[02:36:52.060 --> 02:36:53.860]
Why did we move the process?

[02:36:54.300 --> 02:36:55.860]
Sir, you told me to move the bride.

[02:36:55.880 --> 02:36:56.860]
I didn't tell you.

[02:36:56.980 --> 02:36:58.480]
You must have misunderstood me.

[02:36:58.480 --> 02:36:59.580]
No, sir.

[02:36:59.740 --> 02:37:01.700]
You said move the practice to Monday.

[02:37:01.700 --> 02:37:03.520]
Hey, hey, listen, butt wipe.

[02:37:04.160 --> 02:37:04.680]
I'm the boss.

[02:37:04.980 --> 02:37:05.860]
I make the decisions.

[02:37:05.920 --> 02:37:07.200]
You take the heat.

[02:37:07.540 --> 02:37:09.260]
You all move the practice.

[02:37:09.700 --> 02:37:09.940]
OK.

[02:37:10.420 --> 02:37:11.660]
How are we going with it anyway?

[02:37:11.800 --> 02:37:13.240]
I am mad.

[02:37:13.360 --> 02:37:14.100]
Hold on.

[02:37:14.160 --> 02:37:14.840]
What are you doing?

[02:37:15.080 --> 02:37:15.600]
Remaz.

[02:37:16.520 --> 02:37:17.080]
Yeah, boss.

[02:37:17.500 --> 02:37:19.400]
Shot the hell up.

[02:37:19.760 --> 02:37:21.220]
I'm on the phone, Remaz.

[02:37:21.540 --> 02:37:22.000]
Hi, there.

[02:37:22.460 --> 02:37:23.180]
Yes, sir.

[02:37:23.200 --> 02:37:23.860]
What was your question?

[02:37:24.160 --> 02:37:25.040]
I'm telling you.

[02:37:25.180 --> 02:37:26.900]
I'm going crazy over here.

[02:37:26.900 --> 02:37:32.020]
Between David Kelly and now Michael Jackson called me every three minutes, I'm going to

[02:37:32.020 --> 02:37:33.460]
go out of my freaking mind.

[02:37:34.480 --> 02:37:35.340]
Hold on.

[02:37:36.080 --> 02:37:36.460]
Remaz.

[02:37:37.260 --> 02:37:38.260]
Yeah, here you go.

[02:37:38.820 --> 02:37:39.540]
Stop it, Remaz.

[02:37:40.520 --> 02:37:41.760]
I'm going to fall low.

[02:37:42.100 --> 02:37:43.680]
Stop falling low, Remaz.

[02:37:44.600 --> 02:37:45.120]
Remaz.

[02:37:45.120 --> 02:37:45.280]
Remaz.

[02:37:45.920 --> 02:37:47.740]
It's one thing to my hand, Remaz.

[02:37:48.080 --> 02:37:49.280]
That's your penis, boss.

[02:37:49.480 --> 02:37:50.860]
My other hand, Remaz.

[02:37:51.800 --> 02:37:53.040]
That's the phone, boss.

[02:37:53.160 --> 02:37:53.400]
Right.

[02:37:53.620 --> 02:37:55.740]
I can't hear anything, Remaz.

[02:37:56.000 --> 02:37:56.880]
Stop sawing the phone.

[02:37:56.880 --> 02:37:56.880]

[02:37:56.880 --> 02:37:56.880]

[02:37:56.880 --> 02:37:56.880]

[02:37:56.880 --> 02:37:56.880]

[02:37:56.880 --> 02:37:56.880]

[02:37:56.880 --> 02:37:56.880]

[02:37:56.880 --> 02:37:56.880]

[02:37:56.880 --> 02:37:57.000]
I'm going to fall.

[02:37:57.500 --> 02:37:57.820]
Sorry.

[02:37:58.180 --> 02:37:59.020]
I said, sir.

[02:37:59.640 --> 02:38:01.520]
The moves are working out very well.

[02:38:01.880 --> 02:38:04.900]
The practice is fourth and it's time slot and fourth and fourth.

[02:38:05.560 --> 02:38:05.560]

[02:38:05.560 --> 02:38:05.560]

[02:38:05.560 --> 02:38:05.560]

[02:38:05.560 --> 02:38:05.560]

[02:38:05.560 --> 02:38:05.720]
What?

[02:38:05.720 --> 02:38:06.000]
What?

[02:38:06.020 --> 02:38:06.020]

[02:38:06.260 --> 02:38:06.260]

[02:38:06.300 --> 02:38:06.300]

[02:38:08.840 --> 02:38:09.360]
What?

[02:38:09.960 --> 02:38:09.980]
What?

[02:38:09.980 --> 02:38:10.020]
What?

[02:38:10.020 --> 02:38:10.260]
What?

[02:38:10.260 --> 02:38:10.260]

[02:38:10.260 --> 02:38:10.260]

[02:38:10.260 --> 02:38:10.260]

[02:38:10.260 --> 02:38:10.400]
What?

[02:38:10.400 --> 02:38:10.400]

[02:38:10.400 --> 02:38:10.400]

[02:38:10.400 --> 02:38:10.400]

[02:38:10.400 --> 02:38:10.440]
What?

[02:38:10.840 --> 02:38:11.240]
What?

[02:38:16.140 --> 02:38:16.620]
What?

[02:38:19.600 --> 02:38:20.040]
What?

[02:38:20.200 --> 02:38:20.200]

[02:38:20.200 --> 02:38:20.200]

[02:38:20.200 --> 02:38:20.200]

[02:38:20.200 --> 02:38:20.200]

[02:38:20.200 --> 02:38:20.200]

[02:38:20.200 --> 02:38:20.200]

[02:38:20.200 --> 02:38:23.220]
What's the hell you're doing with a high monocoreal?

[02:38:23.980 --> 02:38:24.040]
What?

[02:38:24.200 --> 02:38:24.300]
What?

[02:38:24.300 --> 02:38:24.300]

[02:38:24.300 --> 02:38:24.300]

[02:38:24.300 --> 02:38:25.140]
Don't play, Remaz.

[02:38:25.400 --> 02:38:27.020]
I'll jam the thing down your throat.

[02:38:27.880 --> 02:38:29.580]
Get the food right away from me.

[02:38:29.920 --> 02:38:31.000]
Oh, come on, Blueberry.

[02:38:31.760 --> 02:38:32.720]
I'm allergic.

[02:38:33.240 --> 02:38:34.020]
I saw.

[02:38:34.340 --> 02:38:36.840]
Sir, over 25 million people saw.

[02:38:36.920 --> 02:38:37.700]
Shut up, Eisner.

[02:38:38.360 --> 02:38:38.580]
Listen.

[02:38:38.960 --> 02:38:39.060]
Yeah.

[02:38:39.480 --> 02:38:40.840]
You see me what I'm doing here?

[02:38:41.720 --> 02:38:42.800]
Sir, you're on the phone.

[02:38:43.260 --> 02:38:44.860]
I know I'm on the phone.

[02:38:44.960 --> 02:38:45.980]
Do you see what I'm doing?

[02:38:46.660 --> 02:38:48.900]
You're an imagination for crying out loud.

[02:38:49.520 --> 02:38:51.240]
I'm moving my hands up and down.

[02:38:51.420 --> 02:38:51.860]
Slide aside.

[02:38:52.200 --> 02:38:53.020]
I'm the puppet master.

[02:38:53.780 --> 02:38:54.460]
I say it.

[02:38:54.640 --> 02:38:55.340]
You do it.

[02:38:55.640 --> 02:38:59.640]
Now Fox is going to air all the stuff that you cut out of a Michael Jackson interview.

[02:39:00.440 --> 02:39:03.560]
But sir, you told me to edit out all that stuff to make him look like a man.

[02:39:03.560 --> 02:39:04.820]
And then, then, then, then, then.

[02:39:05.380 --> 02:39:06.260]
Puppet master.

[02:39:06.700 --> 02:39:06.980]
Me.

[02:39:08.020 --> 02:39:08.460]
Idiot.

[02:39:09.380 --> 02:39:09.820]
Oh.

[02:39:11.980 --> 02:39:12.420]
Puppet!

[02:39:14.500 --> 02:39:15.340]
Reveal the mind.

[02:39:15.460 --> 02:39:16.260]
Here's the apple.

[02:39:16.580 --> 02:39:18.260]
What the hell are you doing now?

[02:39:18.760 --> 02:39:19.680]
It's in the floor, though.

[02:39:19.880 --> 02:39:21.620]
It's nothing wrong with the floor, Remus.

[02:39:21.800 --> 02:39:22.780]
What's this in my ear?

[02:39:23.200 --> 02:39:24.420]
That's your penis, boss.

[02:39:24.620 --> 02:39:26.040]
My other ear, Remus.

[02:39:27.060 --> 02:39:27.960]
That's the phone, boss.

[02:39:27.980 --> 02:39:29.160]
That's the phone, Remus.

[02:39:29.320 --> 02:39:29.660]
Get out.

[02:39:29.940 --> 02:39:30.880]
Come on over to work.

[02:39:31.040 --> 02:39:31.600]
Get out.

[02:39:32.300 --> 02:39:32.740]
Eisner.

[02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:33.320]
Yes, sir.

[02:39:33.460 --> 02:39:33.880]
Killin' me.

[02:39:34.820 --> 02:39:35.540]
Killin' me.

[02:39:35.760 --> 02:39:36.520]
I'm sorry, sir.

[02:39:36.840 --> 02:39:37.600]
Killin' me.

[02:39:37.980 --> 02:39:38.340]
I'm sorry.

[02:39:38.800 --> 02:39:39.720]
Killin' me, softly.

[02:39:40.820 --> 02:39:42.200]
And what about Roberta Flack?

[02:39:42.760 --> 02:39:43.220]
What about her?

[02:39:43.500 --> 02:39:43.800]
I don't know.

[02:39:44.240 --> 02:39:45.860]
I just thought I'd say that because I love that song.

[02:39:46.240 --> 02:39:48.860]
Anyway, the votes with the 20 or more, that's all we'll give now.

[02:39:48.980 --> 02:39:49.860]
Grateful dead 24.

[02:39:50.420 --> 02:39:51.840]

[02:40:02.400 --> 02:40:02.700]
The Beatles.

[02:40:03.380 --> 02:40:04.400]
And look at that.

[02:40:04.520 --> 02:40:04.920]
It's an 80.

[02:40:05.180 --> 02:40:05.700]
That's the one coming.

[02:40:17.080 --> 02:40:17.740]

I'm sorry.

[02:43:05.220 --> 02:43:05.220]

[02:43:05.220 --> 02:43:05.220]

[02:43:06.920 --> 02:43:08.420]
But what do I do?

[02:43:10.160 --> 02:43:12.000]
What do I do?

[02:43:12.180 --> 02:43:13.820]
What do I do?

[02:43:18.640 --> 02:43:23.980]
But you and me, for me, is much better, 6 to 10, not 5.

[02:43:24.500 --> 02:43:27.780]
It's only right that I should get more sleep at night.

[02:43:28.320 --> 02:43:31.580]
I think we might be happy to get there.

[02:43:31.580 --> 02:43:33.000]
But what do I do?

[02:43:33.700 --> 02:43:35.320]
I think we might be happy to get there.

[02:43:35.920 --> 02:43:36.600]
What do I do?

[02:43:37.020 --> 02:43:42.000]
What do I do?

[02:43:44.560 --> 02:43:46.380]
What do I do?

[02:43:46.380 --> 02:43:47.360]
What do I do?

[02:43:48.220 --> 02:43:50.140]
What do I do?

[02:43:50.200 --> 02:43:50.980]
What do I do?

[02:43:51.900 --> 02:43:57.320]
What do I do?

[02:43:57.320 --> 02:44:00.020]
What do I do?

[02:44:00.020 --> 02:44:00.300]
What do I do?

[02:44:04.760 --> 02:44:15.940]
Ooh, you're a ugly bearded one. Your time has come.

[02:44:16.340 --> 02:44:19.260]
We think it's about time you died, or summer?

[02:44:19.660 --> 02:44:22.480]
Ooh, we want you to arrive, get or alive.

[02:44:22.860 --> 02:44:25.840]
There is not a place that you can hide, or summer?

[02:44:25.840 --> 02:44:28.160]
Ooh, you make a sick, such a prick.

[02:44:28.400 --> 02:44:30.480]
Time to say goodbye, wait until she outlaw.

[02:44:30.760 --> 02:44:33.060]
Please tell him that we also had high-bye.

[02:44:33.620 --> 02:44:35.200]
Bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye.

[02:44:35.500 --> 02:44:35.760]
Woo!

[02:44:36.860 --> 02:44:38.680]
Did you just die, or summer?

[02:44:41.960 --> 02:44:43.800]
Come a little closer, huh?

[02:44:44.320 --> 02:44:45.060]
A will ya, huh?

[02:44:45.500 --> 02:44:47.560]
Jump this forehead up your ass and die.

[02:44:47.880 --> 02:44:48.460]
Or summer?

[02:44:48.820 --> 02:44:51.540]
Hiding in Afghanistan, the Taliban.

[02:44:52.040 --> 02:44:55.040]
Soon, you will be running out of time or summer.

[02:44:55.040 --> 02:44:57.280]
Ooh, you make a sick, such a prick.

[02:44:57.580 --> 02:44:59.780]
Time to say goodbye, wait until she outlaw.

[02:45:00.040 --> 02:45:04.400]
Please tell him that we also had high-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye.

[02:45:04.820 --> 02:45:05.000]
Woo!

[02:45:06.220 --> 02:45:07.940]
Did you just die, or summer?

[02:45:09.380 --> 02:45:11.240]
Did you just die, or summer?

[02:45:15.180 --> 02:45:21.160]
Coming up tonight, on inside the behind-the-true Hollywood celebrity music biography profile story,

[02:45:21.160 --> 02:45:24.920]
we take a good, hard stiff look into start-up.

[02:45:24.920 --> 02:45:27.180]
Sure, bad a fair amount of whang,

[02:45:27.600 --> 02:45:30.580]
but man, they had chung coming up air-hears.

[02:45:30.920 --> 02:45:32.960]
They were wang chung.

[02:45:33.180 --> 02:45:36.120]
Everybody whang chung, just madly,

[02:45:37.660 --> 02:45:39.600]
everybody whang chung, just madly.

[02:45:39.600 --> 02:45:43.220]
What we were saying with that song was basically, you know,

[02:45:43.880 --> 02:45:45.540]
everybody have fun tonight.

[02:45:46.100 --> 02:45:49.000]
It's like, it's like f**king Zen, you know?

[02:45:49.000 --> 02:45:51.440]
It's all Chinese and Zen like.

[02:45:51.900 --> 02:45:52.080]
Yeah.

[02:45:52.420 --> 02:45:53.760]
It's a nice exclusive interview.

[02:45:54.120 --> 02:45:55.840]
Wang chung's lead singer, Jack Hughes,

[02:45:56.480 --> 02:45:59.540]
engages in some really pre-moent-electual masturbation.

[02:45:59.620 --> 02:46:02.340]
You was on the same bed,

[02:46:03.660 --> 02:46:07.060]
and I danced all day.

[02:46:07.440 --> 02:46:09.640]
And then, in dance hall days,

[02:46:10.220 --> 02:46:12.200]
we were saying basically, you know,

[02:46:12.540 --> 02:46:14.440]
dance hall days.

[02:46:15.460 --> 02:46:16.480]
F**king amazing.

[02:46:16.480 --> 02:46:18.340]
I beg you, I beg you.

[02:46:18.620 --> 02:46:20.900]
What you want to name the band Wang Chung for?

[02:46:21.140 --> 02:46:23.300]
You stupid f**king gold blouse.

[02:46:23.520 --> 02:46:26.720]
We'll hear from the band's first manager, Anthony, up your uncle.

[02:46:27.020 --> 02:46:29.660]
Cool, Jack was such a pretentious little no-bend.

[02:46:30.120 --> 02:46:32.600]
And his hope will also be about the name of the band.

[02:46:32.920 --> 02:46:35.840]
And tonight, never before seen footage of Jack Hughes

[02:46:35.840 --> 02:46:38.320]
explaining himself until his head explodes.

[02:46:38.840 --> 02:46:41.620]
Well, the philosophy of Juan Chung

[02:46:41.620 --> 02:46:43.700]
seeks to find a pitch of music

[02:46:43.700 --> 02:46:46.520]
which conforms to the principles of cosmic order.

[02:46:46.720 --> 02:46:50.020]
This is the yellow bell that rings at the center of the universe.

[02:46:50.280 --> 02:46:51.940]
Create a vibration, and not only that,

[02:46:52.080 --> 02:46:53.340]
but Juan Chung works for the band.

[02:46:56.400 --> 02:46:58.120]
It's a big juicy,

[02:46:58.400 --> 02:47:02.480]
sopping wet look at show business tonight on Inside the Behind.

[02:47:04.600 --> 02:47:06.220]
151-560 W.D. Cuyamont,

[02:47:06.220 --> 02:47:06.760]
I'll tell you one thing.

[02:47:06.820 --> 02:47:08.880]
Our poll is coming along just about the way I expected.

[02:47:09.260 --> 02:47:10.300]
Beatles third, right?

[02:47:10.800 --> 02:47:11.040]
Right.

[02:47:11.040 --> 02:47:16.400]
60 votes, stones on top, 73, and sandwich right in between, number two spot.

[02:47:16.480 --> 02:47:18.180]
It's an angry, that's going to be a double.

[02:47:18.620 --> 02:47:20.040]
It's an angry, that's a double.

[02:47:20.440 --> 02:47:21.580]
Little C-Soul-Cruz.

[02:47:21.780 --> 02:47:23.040]
We have the idea.

[02:47:25.100 --> 02:47:25.680]
Oh man.

[02:47:25.820 --> 02:47:26.380]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

[02:47:26.720 --> 02:47:27.620]
Does it for me?

[02:47:27.820 --> 02:47:28.160]
Pindaho.

[02:47:30.040 --> 02:47:32.580]
Summer time in South Florida guarantees three things.

[02:47:32.620 --> 02:47:33.500]
Heat humidity in hurricanes.

[02:47:33.820 --> 02:47:34.900]
You know, you can't control the weather,

[02:47:35.040 --> 02:47:37.920]
but you can control how you protect your home during hurricanes season.

[02:47:37.920 --> 02:47:41.400]

That's 1-800-538-0191.

[02:48:57.960 --> 02:49:04.940]
That pipe smoker and uncircumse I skew, would bend and gauge in the fatal of death.

[02:49:07.260 --> 02:49:14.340]
I'm a cranky homo-fold, not that I mind it, but I'm way too old.

[02:49:14.700 --> 02:49:22.560]
I fantasize about fear and death, and at risk with feed-loos my boyfriend did it.

[02:49:22.560 --> 02:49:29.360]
I'll just make up with Ginger in some thing, and then ask him to rate my fun.

[02:49:30.780 --> 02:49:32.900]
No, there ain't no more again.

[02:49:34.980 --> 02:49:46.160]
Though I would not feel the most fooling, and I would not be ashamed about a Ginger and more gay union

[02:49:46.160 --> 02:49:49.700]
Just bold and then stroking away.

[02:49:51.500 --> 02:49:54.200]
Boy, baby, kill me, you're not my guy.

[02:49:55.000 --> 02:49:55.500]
Yeah!

[02:49:55.880 --> 02:49:58.420]
You sound like a nine-year-old kid.

[02:49:58.720 --> 02:49:59.040]
Hey!

[02:50:00.280 --> 02:50:02.260]
Only a macho-menly guy.

[02:50:02.620 --> 02:50:03.520]
You don't know me.

[02:50:03.800 --> 02:50:06.200]
That makes me lift my wings.

[02:50:07.620 --> 02:50:14.180]
If Ginger was a lover of mine, I'd bury my oldest baby now.

[02:50:15.200 --> 02:50:19.180]
Inside his pimply rear end, today, today, today.

[02:50:19.900 --> 02:50:23.120]
No, I would not be a sport-old.

[02:50:23.400 --> 02:50:23.620]
Now!

[02:50:24.140 --> 02:50:34.740]
If I was not a closet of faith, that's why a Ginger and more gay union would make me feel giddy and gay.

[02:50:35.660 --> 02:50:37.440]
Everybody follow my thousand balls.

[02:50:37.760 --> 02:50:44.160]
Yeah, Ginger and more gay union would make my sorrel-boney ass kill-stay.

[02:50:44.920 --> 02:50:52.160]
If we had a Ginger and more gay union, then he wouldn't have to get me raped, evident.

[02:51:14.160 --> 02:51:19.680]
Full motivation on the fields of battle.

[02:51:20.680 --> 02:51:26.600]
He's open-served to a nation of a feeding cattle.

[02:51:27.880 --> 02:51:29.920]
We'll see nobody's back.

[02:51:31.460 --> 02:51:33.720]
Work ask it straight with class.

[02:51:35.240 --> 02:51:38.900]
And that the television shed face won't feed you.

[02:51:41.880 --> 02:51:46.280]
I'll tell you something that you won't be seeing on the news.

[02:51:49.120 --> 02:51:53.060]
We're burning, we're burning, we're burning our troops.

[02:51:56.180 --> 02:51:59.960]
We're burning, we're burning, we're burning our troops.

[02:52:07.080 --> 02:52:09.180]
And we have good ways on.

[02:52:10.300 --> 02:52:12.740]
We're keeping us in the dark.

[02:52:13.920 --> 02:52:16.380]
A noble act of praise on.

[02:52:17.340 --> 02:52:19.520]
We're far best interests at heart.

[02:52:21.060 --> 02:52:23.060]
No need no civil rights.

[02:52:24.580 --> 02:52:26.620]
If you have nothing to hide,

[02:52:27.700 --> 02:52:30.940]
so just relax on your back as a question-y-all.

[02:52:34.820 --> 02:52:37.360]
Why do you concern long as you're the winner?

[02:52:37.840 --> 02:52:39.200]
It's all gonna be you.

[02:52:42.240 --> 02:52:49.360]
We're burning, we're burning, we're burning, we're burning our troops.

[02:52:53.280 --> 02:52:56.560]
That little black thing that's walking on that little black thing,

[02:52:56.560 --> 02:52:57.520]
has that stupid-

[02:52:57.520 --> 02:52:58.440]
Bye, bye, bye!

[02:52:58.980 --> 02:53:01.260]
I'm gonna show you what I'm fighting for.

[02:53:01.840 --> 02:53:04.440]
I wanna give you a kiss.

[02:53:04.620 --> 02:53:06.260]
You can kiss my rear end.

[02:53:06.380 --> 02:53:06.840]
Absolutely.
