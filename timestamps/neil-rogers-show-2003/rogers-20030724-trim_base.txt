[00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.980]
wow and I'm excited man in fact maybe if they'd have paid more attention to Hitler there'd be a lot more people still alive

[00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.800]

[00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.480]
hey

[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.180]
Well, he calls the front man, and asks me a young girl for food.

[00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.100]
She said it's not my job.

[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.060]
But he didn't want to be rude.

[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.920]
She knocked on the door, and then walked to her surprise.

[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.320]
It was her that he was at the Nothin' Bungering Prize.

[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.420]
He sent you to the water, but he claimed it was romance.

[00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.460]
And told me, couldn't you keep his life happy in his place?

[00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.340]
You call that a penis?

[00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.800]
OK, here's my buddy, WQA, and hello.

[00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:01.960]
Hello?

[00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:03.200]
Oh, it's not him.

[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:03.880]
Yes, sir.

[00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:05.820]
Yellow.

[00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:07.100]
Yes, hello.

[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:08.460]
Hello.

[00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.940]
Q-A-N.

[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:12.920]
OK, here we could have done that.

[00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:13.360]
Give out a ticket.

[00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:15.040]
It's that guy wanted tickets, and that's all.

[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.040]
Either that or you want to hear some more Celia Cruz.

[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.180]
Oh, yeah, we got lots of Celia for it.

[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.020]
And to make up for George is a really just a self-hating

[00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.960]
spick who just can't stop picking on people who are dead.

[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:27.500]
Shame on you.

[00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.260]
No wonder you were getting death threats.

[00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.580]
Yeah.

[00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.320]
This is the poll question George asked yesterday.

[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:34.880]
If they were all to disappear tomorrow, who

[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:35.820]
would you miss the least?

[00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.460]
1120 votes, pretty good for a George poll.

[00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.640]
Clergy men, women, that's what I voted for.

[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.040]
Fortune tellers, rabbis, nuns, fakers.

[00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:45.360]
In other words, 478.

[00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:48.000]
Fashion designers, 254.

[00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:50.540]
That found homophobic to me.

[00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:54.660]
Professional athletes, 121, talk to your host, 105.

[00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:00.900]
DJs in VJs 94, actors in actresses 33, artists 20,

[00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:02.220]
and musicians only 15.

[00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:04.700]
Because we all, as George said yesterday,

[00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:05.220]
I did hear that.

[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:06.620]
You said, we all love music.

[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.040]
One dynamite.

[00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:10.460]
And just, I don't want them to think I only

[00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:11.200]
have that one song.

[00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:12.460]
I got like, I've got millions.

[00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:16.040]
All right, here we go.

[00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:16.880]
All right.

[00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:21.620]
I'll do that like a man in a dress, a big fat girl looking

[00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:24.160]
at a man in a dress, a sailor.

[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:32.240]
Wow.

[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.100]
I mean, could she sing?

[00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:35.040]
Did she look good?

[00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:35.960]
Was she entertaining?

[00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:37.920]
But boys, she was an icon.

[00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:41.360]
And I think that I wasn't going to even talk about it,

[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.080]
but I just want to dig down into my pile here.

[00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:43.900]
We don't have a lot of time.

[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:45.520]
We got a ball game at 1230, dammit.

[00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:46.460]
Yeah.

[00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:48.200]
No, no, seriously, I have the one day

[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:49.320]
when we didn't want a ball game.

[00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:50.080]
This would have been the day.

[00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:51.440]
Because we want to be rating intensive.

[00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:52.780]
Although I don't think it's going to be too good.

[00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:54.460]
I think it's going to be really bad.

[00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:56.480]
I believe that it's going to be nasty.

[00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:00.420]
Oprah, top, top icon, VH1 says.

[00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:01.580]
So that should tell you the reason

[00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:03.880]
that Sadia Cruz was so big in the Kubano community.

[00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:07.960]
If Oprah, and this is VH1's assessment

[00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:11.820]
of the 200 greatest pop culture icons of 10 episode ranking

[00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:13.280]
of actors, musicians, politicians,

[00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:15.800]
academic sports figures, and fictional characters.

[00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:19.000]
Oprah was number one, Elvis number two.

[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.020]
Ready for that?

[00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:21.580]
No.

[00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:24.940]
So probably Sadia Cruz is number one in the Cuban community,

[00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:26.740]
and this year, there's this numero dos.

[00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:27.740]
Wouldn't you think?

[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:28.620]
Crying shame.

[00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:30.840]
And Iliana Rosanna Dan is probably numero.

[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:34.140]
numero zero.

[00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:36.760]
Oh, she was on one of the talking hits

[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:38.220]
Jose, they pressed up for about two minutes.

[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:39.780]
I just see her in my blood boils.

[00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:40.560]
I get pissed off.

[00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:42.480]
I just want to puke.

[00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:45.760]
Well, that couldn't be the guy in for Lauderdale online.

[00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:46.480]
Six could it?

[00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:47.280]
Yes, it is.

[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:47.720]
Me neither.

[00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:49.760]
No, that wasn't him.

[00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:51.420]
Now, that was, that was Fony Red.

[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.400]
Now, it was so weak, so lame.

[00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:56.240]
You aren't even the same league with my Pizzerna.

[00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:56.480]
I'm out there.

[00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.540]
You got to do it like with the rest of real enthusiasts.

[00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:01.540]
That was lame, man.

[00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:02.200]
That was very weak.

[00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:03.520]
He's probably in the Vajasion.

[00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:05.880]
In fact, maybe he's the what's your name's funeral?

[00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:10.320]
Don't be making fun of Sadia Cruz again all day today.

[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:11.240]
They hate you now.

[00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:12.140]
They can't see you.

[00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:13.820]
Anyway, now let's see.

[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:15.800]
Which one of these would be good music in the background?

[00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:16.580]
One moment please.

[00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:18.400]
OK, for my Hillary out chapter today,

[00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:19.700]
we got a shirt one for it.

[00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:22.600]
Living history, Hillary Rodham Clinton each day,

[00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:24.460]
a chapter a day or a paragraph,

[00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:26.220]
but it keeps the dial doctor away.

[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:28.700]
Here we go.

[00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:31.940]
Now that's too upbeat for this.

[00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:32.420]
Mm-hmm.

[00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:34.600]
There we go.

[00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:35.860]
Little one mellow.

[00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:38.620]
My father was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania,

[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:40.980]
the middle son of Hugh Rodham Sr. and Hannah Jones.

[00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:43.480]
He got his looks from the line of Blackhade Wells

[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:45.040]
Cold Miners on his mother's side.

[00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:47.420]
By Hannah, he was hard-headed and often gruff.

[00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:49.460]
Although he laughed, the sound came from deep inside

[00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:51.800]
and seemed to engage every part of his body.

[00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:54.840]
I heard that his laugh is same big rolling gaffer

[00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:56.400]
that can turn heads in a restaurant

[00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:58.980]
and send cats running from the room to his Hillary.

[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:03.460]
When I did, he didn't even step on it.

[00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:04.300]
But he liked that.

[00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:12.960]
Oh, man, could she sing?

[00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:13.180]
No.

[00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:13.740]
Or what?

[00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:14.960]
That's Celia Cruz.

[00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:19.760]
So you people of Miguel and Beater Boy

[00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:21.160]
that I was settled with there on Tuesday,

[00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:22.860]
they live in a whole different,

[00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:24.960]
which leads to the poll question today.

[00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:26.140]
Let's get that on there right away.

[00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:28.580]
They live in this Cuban-centric world

[00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:30.860]
where they exclude like stuff

[00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:32.060]
from the outside from the real world

[00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:33.140]
that everybody else cares about.

[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:34.840]
They just don't get it.

[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:35.460]
I think offense.

[00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:36.580]
I'm good.

[00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:39.640]
That's what it was intended for to make you a very offended.

[00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:42.140]
Here's the poll today.

[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:44.600]
How come I wrote your real face down on here?

[00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:46.780]
I'm just a, no, because that's what you were saying.

[00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:48.800]
But I, no, as soon as you, I put,

[00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:52.020]
and I wrote it down because I didn't want to forget it.

[00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:54.540]
Your real face, for Celia, a man in a dress.

[00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:57.340]
She had a lot in common with the pope.

[00:09:58.240 --> 00:09:59.800]
Although he was a snappier dresser.

[00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:02.240]
Which ethnic religious or racial group

[00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:03.400]
is the most overly sensitive?

[00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:05.560]
That's our poll question today on neo-rogyens.com.

[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.740]
Which ethnic religious or racial group

[00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:09.420]
is the most overly sensitive?

[00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:11.860]
And you'll notice Eric that I underlined

[00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:14.880]
and put like in gigantic overly sensitive question mark.

[00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:19.000]
So here's my, a group for right now, my selection,

[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:21.360]
blacks, Cubans, Cubans.

[00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:23.280]
So great, but Jews, oh!

[00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:25.920]
Rednecks, Chinese or Catholics.

[00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:28.640]
I couldn't think of anybody else,

[00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:29.580]
but I'm sure somebody might.

[00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:31.640]
That's a pretty good start.

[00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:35.500]
Overly sensitive, two ethnic, to ethnocentric,

[00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:39.140]
to obsessed with their own caca,

[00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:41.240]
whatever you want to put it.

[00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:41.820]
Caca?

[00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:44.080]
I'm amazed that you didn't do the

[00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:46.400]
Osuori owner busted story, a bigger partner.

[00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:49.940]
An Israeli antiques collector who sent a burial box

[00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:52.120]
purported to be that of Jesus' brother James,

[00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:54.400]
the late Jimmy Christ, to Toronto late last year,

[00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:56.480]
has been arrested on suspicion of forgery.

[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.840]
It turns out it wasn't the burial box of Jimmy Christ.

[00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:03.680]
Odette Golan accused of creating two forgeries

[00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:05.780]
that trick the religious and archeological world

[00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:07.100]
appeared in court yesterday,

[00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:08.460]
and they after police arrested him.

[00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:10.740]
I can imagine if it would have turned out to be

[00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:12.460]
the real thing he could have achieved great heights.

[00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:18.300]
Odette Golan, in court police unveiled forgery equipment

[00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:19.860]
they said was found in Golan's home,

[00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:23.460]
including stencil stones and partially completed forgeries.

[00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:24.060]
Oy!

[00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:26.220]
Golan also was suspected in connection

[00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:27.700]
with a shoebox-sized tablet

[00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:29.180]
and scrabbed with forged instructions

[00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:30.980]
for caring for the Jewish temple.

[00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:32.220]
In other words,

[00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:34.320]
indiziable bliss.

[00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:38.060]
More I play with it, the more I like it.

[00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:40.020]
Its got its moments.

[00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:42.180]

I got it with that!

[00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:51.500]
He was on for the last three weeks in a book.

[00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:52.420]
This was the big deal,

[00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:53.800]
I was supposed to bail us out of it,

[00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:55.040]

You're wrong,

[00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:00.260]

Because sports just makes me

[00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:50.520]
But when I'm around

[00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:56.780]
I just don't know what to do. I'm a sport

[00:14:56.780 --> 00:15:06.660]

[00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:54.020]
I haven't seen him yet today. Well here probably he's probably busy in sports meetings

[00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:57.400]
28 votes on there already on a pole which is popped up well

[00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:59.700]
I think religious or I beg your pardon and go vote

[00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:05.960]
Oratial group is the I know who you're voting for is the most overly sensitive

[00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:07.920]
Lact 12

[00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:09.740]
Cubans 11

[00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:12.340]
Juz 5

[00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:17.180]
And no votes if a redneck Chinese are clever. We should have put Irish on there

[00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:23.100]
I mean we certainly are going to put a Italian's on there because Italians and me with a godfather all that stuff in the sopranos

[00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:26.860]
The Italians get picked on all the time and they like do with a good sense of humor

[00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:33.460]
Whatever Italian American definitely do have it but most people don't pay any attention to that

[00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:40.020]
The average Italian person you talked about there's like screaming about all these stereotypes about the city and they're not doing that

[00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:42.140]
No, the other two

[00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:45.880]
Any more than the Irish are screaming about the fact that we all always talk about the

[00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:50.020]
Drug and Red Faced Irishman with the big nose like you know Mike Disney people like that

[00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:56.820]
Here's a thanks from our good close personal friend PR Ralph. Oh, Azucar

[00:16:56.820 --> 00:16:57.480]
One

[00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:02.780]
Don't say that I immediately start thinking of salia every time you say Azucar

[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.360]
It says I've come up with a great idea during commercials on the Marlins game

[00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:11.200]
You can cross over with the book number as you get a bigger audience and I'll be listening till 2pm

[00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:14.480]
It's at a beach that air now we can't do that we got the commosals

[00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:18.640]
We got to get on those commosals, don't we? Oh, yeah, we got lots of commosals

[00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:20.300]
Daura Haller on the Marlins game

[00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:25.180]
Hey, they're red hot. They're five games over 500 anybody care. No as long as they're given freebies away

[00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:29.700]
You know this and of course I just hope when when did he start giving crap away on the show for Ralph?

[00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:32.760]
That wasn't in June that just started last week or two right?

[00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:33.540]
I

[00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:39.380]
Think in two two weeks. Yeah, see that's after the spring book was over because it ended like June 18

[00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:41.040]
I

[00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:44.120]
Think in July as we're gonna take a real big hit boy and again

[00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:49.920]
He's what he's doing is letting these freeloading bastards who have they couldn't care about the station about him about his show

[00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:53.080]
All they want is free crap. We've been through it many times and

[00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:56.440]
And there are how many times that I say we're never gonna do that again

[00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:58.280]
And then we get sucked into it again, you know

[00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:00.700]
Miguel would come in there with a little hurt look on it

[00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:04.600]
Oh, I promised so and so you know and we'd have to give away a bunch of crap and the show just

[00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:08.900]
DeTiri rates into a bunch of free loading assholes. There's nothing interesting about that

[00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:14.380]
Yeah, that's entertainment. Yeah, right. So I think in July is when he's gonna take a hit

[00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:21.440]
Hopefully not. I mean we're the counting on him because the rest of us are bunches of doddering old dying Jews and we're counting on him to be the hero now

[00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:25.940]
We'll see time will tell like about one o'clock this afternoon

[00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:29.160]
Now you're gonna have to wait till tomorrow morning when I make my cameo guest appearance

Second thing about about them actually killing the two brothers. Yeah, they actually

Who say in pussy? I'm sorry pussy and pussy

[00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:58.520]
Yeah, the reason they haven't shown the picture shit is because they're actually doing a cut and taste and it takes a little water

[00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:03.140]
Yeah, right to do to do one of those if they had been or working on it

For him to be from listening to your radio station just because of that because of what because of that my wife

[00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:23.000]
I'm kicking my birthday three days

[00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:24.540]
Well, don't be a

[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:28.980]
Kick her ass out on the street. No, did you see the godfather?

[00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:34.300]
Yeah, the problem is I have a tie to the front yard. You remember to say with Carlo and

[00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:39.420]
What's your name? They're Connie weld. I don't want to plan any seeds in your mind, but that's the idea

[00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:44.100]
Get that belt out. How to great time pal?

[00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:47.120]
Be the crap out of that bitch. Now see you shouldn't be saying it now

[00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:49.280]
I'm gonna start sounding like Tom do like us that asshole

[00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:55.340]
That bag it that bag it who just decided to give out the name of the rapie victim in the alleged Kobe Bryant rapie

[00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:59.600]
And of course his whole show is based on like the Tom Cruise character in Magnolia hating women

[00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:00.120]
That's his whole

[00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:01.800]
He's not

[00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:04.100]
Will you stop saying that crap?

[00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:09.520]
Here's the good news though. We got some good news today house votes to block expended FCC

[00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:14.560]
Elimits and even though the president they continues to say which is a joke that he's been a veto the bill

[00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:17.760]
The vote was four hundred to twenty one

[00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:23.860]
All right a vote of four hundred to twenty one lawmakers approved the spending bill with language blocking the FCC

[00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:30.460]
Decision to let companies on TV stations serving up to forty five percent of the country's viewers the current ceiling is thirty five percent

[00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:33.680]
And Michael Powell is pissed off and assured the finance

[00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:37.740]
He issued a written statement before the vote defending the commission's decision

[00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:42.320]
Yadi yadi yadi we're confident in our position Powell said we created enforceable rules

[00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:46.480]
They reflect the realities of today's media marketplace the rules will benefit Americans by protecting

[00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:52.380]
Localism competition and diversity who the hell are you kiddin? Obviously not even too many of your own people mr. Powell

[00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:53.800]
Junior another liar

[00:21:55.980 --> 00:22:02.620]
Representative David Obey the Democratic Wisconsin chief sponsor they provision that would derail the liberalized FCC rules acknowledge and interview that a tough

[00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:07.040]
Fightly head over keeping language intact in the bills final version, but he declared victory for now

[00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:12.160]
It's extremely rare to be able to reverse a regular throw a decision that gives away the store to the big boys

[00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:16.040]
Obey said well said Obey one can Obey ice-cold baby

[00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:21.540]
So there you go. We may maybe there's a little bit of hope and all you assholes out there all you bush liquors

[00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:28.380]
Like I've said before if you're religious fanatic or if you're a multi-millionaire or billionaire then then all more power to them

[00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:34.360]
That you be out you have all the reason the world to support him and he's Nazis other everybody else. I don't understand it. You get it?

[00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:36.180]
No, I don't know

[00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:43.420]
I just can't I can't stop singing that I can't stop all day all night. You're in the shower now one

[00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:47.680]
Tantamera she's she's dynamite. She's an icon. She was an icon

[00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:52.320]
I'm a big huchi kuchi gorilla face woman in a man's body with a big dress

[00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:57.240]
Well, I can't stand it and she didn't even have no bananas on her head like a Carmen Miranda

[00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:03.920]
So can this must match you'll Carmen Miranda the Pope or Desiree Nez or a salia Cruz. I don't lump Desi in there

[00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:09.720]
Lucy Lucy at least he was a great businessman. He's the bravest behind a whole operation right?

[00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:10.840]
He played like a

[00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:16.060]
Bozo like Luis on the passions he played a poetic that wasn't his real business

[00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:18.020]
But he was like what was his real business?

[00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:25.820]
It's right. He had 47 and five sixty WQM every week over half the customers of Dalai mattress are repeating referral customers because they know

[00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:40.040]
come in it and then, but see.

[00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:43.900]
PEP 33 and PEP 65, 60, we got the,

[00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:47.140]
no mad dog today and we got no Humper, because we got the Marlin Game,

[00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:50.220]
1230 Marlins on deck, 105 Marlins at the Braves,

[00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:52.540]
second of their shirts, here's their own Braves,

[00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:54.440]
there's no question about that, one again last night up there.

[00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:57.820]
And guess who we got it for for the Humper today, one guess.

[00:25:58.020 --> 00:25:58.840]
Perfect, I think.

[00:25:58.880 --> 00:25:59.320]
Good guess.

[00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:03.260]
And he still sucks, feels a gacky old penis face will be on 4-7,

[00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:06.720]
the big 7-10, oh he should be on that list too, you know what?

[00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:09.960]
Well, I don't know, I think about his ethnic attitudes,

[00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:12.000]
but he definitely could be Cuban-centric.

[00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:14.700]
At least he sounds like it.

[00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:18.900]
Then we got Eddie K-10-2 and Joe Mark overnight, 2-5-1-8-M.

[00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:21.600]
How's the first 100 and some votes coming on the pool?

[00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:25.540]
He has 108, which ethnic religious or racial group is the most overly sensitive.

[00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:29.980]
Blacks 48, Cubans 45, we got a neck and neck nose to those battle there

[00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:32.220]
between the Blacks and Cubans.

[00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:34.500]
Now, how do we differentiate like the Black Cubans?

[00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:37.900]
Uh-huh, they don't consider themselves Black.

[00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:40.300]
They don't consider themselves Cuban?

[00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:43.120]
You shut up.

[00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:46.540]
Blacks 48, Cubans 45,

[00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:51.740]
Jewish 13, Catlix 2, Rednex None, and Chinese None.

[00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:54.560]
I don't know why I put Chinese on there, just I had to put something else.

[00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:56.480]
Huh? Yeah, I guess.

[00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:59.160]
And I put Rednex as I had to put some category of white people,

[00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:02.620]
he came to say like, anglos or white people, right?

[00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:03.400]
I guess.

[00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:09.000]
567-0560, pound 563 on the AT&T.

[00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:11.820]
And by the way, we're not going to be doing 1130-1230 comedy,

[00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:13.280]
but so I was joking about that on Tuesday.

[00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:14.600]
That wouldn't that be wrong?

[00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:16.380]
Somehow, that'd be wrong.

[00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:17.320]
Although,

[00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:20.840]
here's Del Rey-Bee, hello.

[00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:22.080]
Good morning, Neil.

[00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:22.840]
Yes, sir.

[00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:25.900]
You were saying that you didn't know C. E. Cruz,

[00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:29.020]
but wasn't there a big song in the 60s by Celeste Lester that heard?

[00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:31.320]
Yeah, good point.

[00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:31.600]
Excellent.

[00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:32.980]
One of my favorites is a matter of fact.

[00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:34.440]
You both get both of the brine on it.

[00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:35.000]
Okay.

[00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:35.700]
Thanks.

[00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:37.720]
Remember C. Cruz, Frankie Ford?

[00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:38.500]
Sure.

[00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:42.600]
What about the Papua de Lilla?

[00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:45.060]
No, no.

[00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:45.660]
No, no.

[00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:49.380]
The cool is turning over on her braid.

[00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:50.640]
But she didn't want to keep this.

[00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:51.760]
She's no good or great.

[00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:55.740]
Oh, baby, that's so good.

[00:27:57.380 --> 00:27:57.820]
So good.

[00:27:57.820 --> 00:27:58.120]
Yeah, baby.

[00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:01.140]
So good.

[00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:01.700]
So good.

[00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:02.400]
So good.

[00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:03.080]
So good.

[00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:04.620]
So good.

[00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:05.240]
So good.

[00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:05.940]
So good.

[00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:06.100]
So good.

[00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:08.900]
See, I can't for life, I may imagine.

[00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:11.140]
For example, it's because there are a lot of our audience,

[00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:12.460]
can't stand Elvis, okay?

[00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:13.340]
Okay.

[00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:15.600]
I mean, with me as far as Elvis, I can take him or leave.

[00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:16.700]
And I liked a lot of his music,

[00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:17.620]
but I can take him or leave.

[00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:19.220]
He's not like to me a big icon.

[00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:20.080]
I can leave him.

[00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:20.880]
Okay.

[00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:24.380]
But I can't imagine anybody who's a big Elvis fan,

[00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:26.360]
even those assholes that slip up there to Graceland.

[00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:28.780]
I can't imagine them calling in death threats

[00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:29.760]
to the radio station.

[00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:30.360]
No, no.

[00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:32.520]
Because somebody said, well, I thought Elvis sucked

[00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:33.880]
or I thought Elvis was like overrated

[00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:35.820]
or Elvis couldn't sing as well as a paper sack.

[00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:37.500]
I don't get that, do you?

[00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:37.800]
No.

[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.420]
I mean, that carries the,

[00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:43.120]
and evidently it wasn't just the death rate calls off the year,

[00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:45.540]
but there were obviously a lot of people out there

[00:28:45.540 --> 00:28:46.300]
in radio land.

[00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:47.760]
Of course, these aren't people

[00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:49.160]
who are supposed to be listening to us anyway.

[00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:51.760]
But I got very offended because of the fact,

[00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:53.860]
and I say it again, I didn't know who she was.

[00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:56.120]
I never heard of her in my life.

[00:28:57.160 --> 00:28:57.700]
Never heard of her.

[00:28:57.780 --> 00:28:59.100]
And the reason that we're carrying on about this

[00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:00.980]
is because obviously we're missing out

[00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:02.740]
on such an important facet of our life.

[00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:05.120]
If you understand, we're missing out on the good stuff.

[00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:08.380]
That's what she's not racing.

[00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:09.340]
That's what she's cool about.

[00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:10.160]
Yeah, Latvia.

[00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:12.280]
That's not tropical.

[00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:13.660]
That'll be called,

[00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:14.700]
Oh, it's tropical.

[00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:15.260]
Yeah.

[00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:18.920]
Tropical acres with your thoughts,

[00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:19.700]
people in the land.

[00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:21.180]
You're in.

[00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:22.980]
What the hell is this thing?

[00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:26.520]
See, just generally speaking,

[00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:27.700]
forgetting about Celia Cruz,

[00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:29.440]
I just don't like that Ho Chi Kuchi music.

[00:29:29.660 --> 00:29:30.480]
No matter who's singing it.

[00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:33.340]
Yeah, even if the least of the girl is singing it,

[00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:34.540]
which he does do some of that stuff,

[00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:35.500]
some of that salsa crap,

[00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:38.140]
I hate that music that it's so corny.

[00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:39.920]
It is so dated.

[00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:41.240]
Right?

[00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:41.760]
Yeah.

[00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:43.700]
Even for an old fossa like me,

[00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:46.740]
it's like, like you made a good point before the show day,

[00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:47.460]
which is about time.

[00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:49.500]
You said that she is to music,

[00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:51.440]
to Hispanics,

[00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:53.440]
what somebody like from the 20s,

[00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:54.340]
and I mentioned Rudy Valley,

[00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:55.460]
which is long before your time,

[00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:57.360]
but she's like the Rudy Valley of music,

[00:29:57.540 --> 00:29:58.420]
to Hispanics.

[00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:00.140]
And you're saying,

[00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:01.340]
who the hell was Rudy Valley?

[00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:02.460]
He was an old,

[00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:03.960]
crusty looking,

[00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:06.060]
couldn't see his way out of a paper sack.

[00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:07.860]
He was great on those Edison Sloan news,

[00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:08.620]
though, it sounded really good.

[00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:10.740]
I bet she she would have been dynamite, I know.

[00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:13.920]
Come on, Celia, bring it sweetheart.

[00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:14.800]
Celia!

[00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:15.280]
Bring it!

[00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:16.400]
Keep it back here.

[00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:17.880]
With musical help, Dan.

[00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:19.920]
They're loving you step by, Celia.

[00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:20.820]
They love you, Paul.

[00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:22.080]
They love you,

[00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:22.620]
they love you,

[00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:24.140]
they love you,

[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:28.100]
How do they say,

[00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:28.740]
I'm not a corn,

[00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:29.800]
that's like that song you're playing.

[00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:32.860]
What, I wouldn't she just say there?

[00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:33.780]
La puta.

[00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:39.560]
Yeah, that's what she said.

[00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:40.360]
She said,

[00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:41.060]
Come on, Celia.

[00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:42.520]
Shame on you,

[00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:43.460]
potty mouth, old bitch.

[00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:46.020]
What, girl, a face?

[00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:48.600]
Which ethnic religious or racial group

[00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:49.920]
is the most overly sensitive,

[00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:51.680]
black, 60, Cubans, 51,

[00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:52.840]
and dark folks are pulling away?

[00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:54.620]
June 17, Chinese,

[00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:55.360]
four, Catholic,

[00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:55.740]
three,

[00:30:56.220 --> 00:30:57.960]
non-forered next set of 135 votes.

[00:30:58.100 --> 00:30:59.120]
No red necks are sensitive,

[00:30:59.340 --> 00:31:00.380]
because to be sensitive,

[00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:00.900]
first of all,

[00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:01.680]
you've got to be able to understand

[00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:02.660]
what people are saying about it.

[00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:04.760]
Their, your IQ has got to be like,

[00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:05.240]
at least,

[00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:06.260]
but third man,

[00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:07.080]
at least that high.

[00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:07.560]
What do you know,

[00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:12.920]
yeah, I feel like I'm on speed today.

[00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:13.620]
Like we're in a big hurry,

[00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:15.320]
because we have a really, really short show

[00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:16.260]
until 12 30.

[00:31:16.580 --> 00:31:17.660]
Rating's coming out at one o'clock.

[00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:18.740]
We're very sorry about that.

[00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:19.300]
We're not going to,

[00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:20.820]
well, you think maybe we ought to put something

[00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:22.060]
on the website about it,

[00:31:22.140 --> 00:31:23.080]
or should we just keep him hanging

[00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:23.900]
till 10 o'clock tomorrow?

[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:24.620]
We'll keep him hanging.

[00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:24.880]

[00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:28.640]
Here's a call from Gary Acquired Tamarack.

[00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:28.920]
Hello.

[00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:30.500]
How you doing, Uncle Mill?

[00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:31.280]
Okay, sir.

[00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:34.280]
I wonder how we could put this way on the pole.

[00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:35.240]
I don't know if we would fit,

[00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:36.580]
but all that conscientombs

[00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:38.700]
with that bull crap going on in the Senate

[00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:41.060]
or in hatch saying that the other

[00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:43.960]
Democrats aren't good Catholic people

[00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:45.480]
with a whole thing with prior.

[00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:47.420]
Did you hear that, Boone?

[00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:49.940]
Democrats aren't good Catholic people?

[00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:53.840]
Yeah, they're trying to say that because

[00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:56.500]
this prior, the Attorney General from Alabama,

[00:31:56.500 --> 00:31:58.600]
they're trying to put up for a federal judge.

[00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:00.740]
Orangas came out with some crap

[00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:03.780]
that the Democrats aren't good Catholic people.

[00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:04.600]
Yeah.

[00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:06.140]
And he said,

[00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:07.400]
What does that mean?

[00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:09.960]
He said that they're not religious people

[00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:12.100]
because they're not okay in this guy,

[00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:15.100]
because he asked him what it is for a Catholic.

[00:32:15.660 --> 00:32:17.380]
Since when is that more of an asshole Catholic?

[00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:18.400]
Since when is he Catholic?

[00:32:19.380 --> 00:32:21.560]
It's just ridiculous with what they're doing

[00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:22.800]
because he even asked him

[00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:25.720]
if he was what was his religious affiliation.

[00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:26.300]
Yeah.

[00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:28.060]
And it just goes to show

[00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:29.680]
that Republican conservatives,

[00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:31.400]
all of these religious zealots,

[00:32:33.260 --> 00:32:35.420]
zealots to, you know,

[00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:37.620]
zealot, harlot, something,

[00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:38.460]
harlot.

[00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:39.420]
Okay, I have a great thing.

[00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:40.480]
What is he talking about?

[00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:41.740]
I didn't understand a word of it.

[00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:42.420]
I mean, just, you know,

[00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:46.020]
just relax, okay?

[00:32:46.140 --> 00:32:46.560]
Well, yeah, I mean,

[00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:48.240]
Orangad Oronsnatch,

[00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:48.940]
Ankerna Change,

[00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:50.740]
he's the same nut job he always has,

[00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:52.140]
been just like Strom Thurman

[00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:53.660]
wasn't until he stuck his ass in the box

[00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:55.760]
and the Jesse Hums and all these other goyems.

[00:32:55.860 --> 00:32:57.040]
Okay, just calm down.

[00:32:57.360 --> 00:32:57.940]
Enjoy life.

[00:32:58.340 --> 00:32:59.480]
Quick, get yourself so worked up

[00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:00.660]
about a bunch of Nazis, okay?

[00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:02.440]
About a bunch of goose stepping fascists

[00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:04.320]
who've taken over the control of the American government.

[00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:06.320]
Easy for me to say.

[00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:08.980]
Beautiful day here, by the way.

[00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:11.280]
Saw you in 72 right now.

[00:33:11.380 --> 00:33:12.760]
Gonna be 79 low humidity.

[00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:13.460]
It's great.

[00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:15.460]
I understand it's like the end of the world there.

[00:33:15.620 --> 00:33:16.600]
Yeah, we're under water already.

[00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:17.860]
Aw, cheese.

[00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:21.340]
22, 11 at 560 WQM.

[00:33:21.340 --> 00:33:23.500]
The Marlins and the Atlanta Braves

[00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:25.060]
at 1230 with a pregame today.

[00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:26.400]
Are we excited about that?

[00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:27.080]
Or what?

[00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:28.360]
Yeah, the ratings can wait for the Marl.

[00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:29.000]
They're not going to be good.

[00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:29.640]
They're going to be.

[00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:30.900]
I predict.

[00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:31.980]
Come on, just put the optimistic.

[00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:33.640]
No, I'm supposed to be honest.

[00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:35.040]
Okay, this is the honest show.

[00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:36.300]
I'm just telling you my gut feeling.

[00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:39.080]
And I have this sick feeling in the pit of my stomach.

[00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:41.300]
It's going to be really a week.

[00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:43.480]
Hey, listen, you can't be on top forever.

[00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:46.260]
And especially when we're counting on Farrell.

[00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:48.140]
I mean, you know, let's see if he can pull his way.

[00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:49.160]
You know, if he can pull it.

[00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:52.200]
Summer time, Neil Deals are going on right now

[00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:54.200]
at Halibut, the Ag GMC and a sunshine

[00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:55.660]
and a rain, whatever makes no difference.

[00:33:56.100 --> 00:33:58.620]
Here's Neil Deal, numero uno is what it says here.

[00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:04.340]
Get 0% financing for 60 months on every 2003 GMC

[00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:05.560]
or Pontiac in stock.

[00:34:06.020 --> 00:34:07.600]
Neil Deal, numero dose.

[00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:12.140]
In any language, get yourself up to a $4,000 rebate

[00:34:12.140 --> 00:34:14.700]
on every 2003 GMC and Pontiac in stock.

[00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:17.840]
Current GMC and Pontiac owners get an additional rebate

[00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:21.340]
up to a grand from your good, close, personal pizons at Halibut.

[00:34:21.660 --> 00:34:23.200]
And of course, Halibut is also got, as always,

[00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:25.260]
a great selection of unbeatable certified pre-owned car

[00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:26.240]
structures UVs.

[00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:28.520]
If you have marginal credit like Beener Boy,

[00:34:28.660 --> 00:34:31.280]
who just, we might have to tell that stir

[00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:32.380]
about the rental car later on.

[00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:34.300]
Pretty embarrassing.

[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:36.120]
So if you've got marginal credit like him

[00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:37.240]
or most people who work in radio,

[00:34:37.660 --> 00:34:39.160]
don't be afraid to shop at Halibut

[00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:40.300]
because they're not going to worry about

[00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:41.700]
perfect credit to get you a deal.

[00:34:42.180 --> 00:34:43.600]
Attention, everybody in the world,

[00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:47.300]

during these summer doldrum days.

[00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:50.440]
So be sure to stop by Halibut and experience

[00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:52.780]
just how easy it is to shop there for a great deal.

[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.240]

[00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:16.280]
That's at Halibut, Ag GMC,

[00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:18.160]
who are beyond the shadow of a doubt.

[00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:19.140]
Professional grade.

[00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:21.740]
I am low.

[00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:24.140]
This is which when you'll price it,

[00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:25.180]
you will.

[00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:29.520]
She was a community I got.

[00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:33.260]
In a community that leaves and I got.

[00:35:33.780 --> 00:35:36.100]
As far as I can tell,

[00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:41.760]
she was the fantastic iconoclastic Celia Brood.

[00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:44.320]
You know,

[00:35:56.820 --> 00:36:01.860]
if you have sounds of Celia Cruz,

[00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:03.240]
she's dead, you know.

[00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:04.580]
Oh, she was so beautiful.

[00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:07.060]
We need that in New York.

[00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:09.220]
In New York, she's a boy.

[00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:10.560]
She's a biogaric,

[00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:12.200]
a black guy who is in New York.

[00:36:16.620 --> 00:36:17.820]
Two-year group,

[00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:19.940]
new social tools for you.

[00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:22.140]
Available now with the Tuesdays,

[00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:23.540]
used CD and Boya.

[00:36:23.780 --> 00:36:25.740]
I wonder if she ever heard of Tommy Matolia's house.

[00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:26.940]
She sounds off me from her duty, you know.

[00:36:27.340 --> 00:36:27.780]
Braaaah!

[00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:28.340]
Yeah,

[00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:30.160]
Halia Celia's same difference,

[00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:31.120]
same person I think.

[00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:31.560]
That's that.

[00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:32.760]
Yeah, they're much more hot.

[00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:42.220]
Me too, no guerrilla faces.

[00:36:42.220 --> 00:36:43.160]
That would you cry and say,

[00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:44.340]
no, she's the leader,

[00:36:44.660 --> 00:36:45.540]
but a hot one is dead.

[00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:49.260]
Never have a hot bean in her house.

[00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:49.640]
She's not living.

[00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:51.640]
Yeah.

[00:36:51.940 --> 00:36:52.260]
Oh.

[00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:53.900]
So what can you be making out of me?

[00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:54.340]
That was the takeout.

[00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:54.800]
Yeah,

[00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:55.800]
oh man.

[00:36:58.960 --> 00:36:59.740]
Yeah, you know something?

[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:00.500]
No, wait a minute.

[00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:01.660]
Is that her or is that a man?

[00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:03.720]
That is her, isn't it?

[00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:03.860]
Yeah.

[00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:04.500]
It could be both.

[00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:07.060]
How was it then?

[00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:08.940]
Oh, that is her.

[00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:09.640]
Right?

[00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:12.740]
That's what she sounds like.

[00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:15.100]
I thought she'd over the head when I was just

[00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:16.140]
standing around like an ombre.

[00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:17.860]
And look like

[00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:18.900]
guerrilla.

[00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:19.480]

[00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:21.660]
guerrilla.

[00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:22.080]

[00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:22.080]

[00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:22.580]
yeah,

[00:37:22.580 --> 00:37:22.660]
yeah,

[00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:23.400]
yeah,

[00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:26.860]
she don't be knocking us okay.

[00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:28.980]
We're paying tribute here to old guerrilla posts.

[00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:31.180]
Don't be knocking us for being disrespectful.

[00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:35.340]
Which ethnic religious or racial group is the most overly sensitive

[00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:36.440]
is our pull question today.

[00:37:36.740 --> 00:37:37.520]
180 votes.

[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:38.680]
Blacks 84,

[00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:39.720]
human 64.

[00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:41.120]
Nobody else even closed.

[00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:42.020]
Do's only 20.

[00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:42.560]
Oi!

[00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:44.280]
Chinese 7,

[00:37:44.780 --> 00:37:45.520]
Catholics 5,

[00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:46.600]
and Rednecks None.

[00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:47.580]
None.

[00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:48.040]
Zero.

[00:37:48.620 --> 00:37:49.640]
No sensitive Rednecks,

[00:37:49.700 --> 00:37:50.600]
and that's a damn good thing.

[00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:51.860]
Don't be picking on a Trader Trash.

[00:37:53.220 --> 00:37:54.640]
Here's a call from West Palm Beach.

[00:37:54.740 --> 00:37:54.920]
Hello.

[00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:57.460]
Hey, I got a little bit of a material here.

[00:37:57.800 --> 00:37:58.900]
What do you want me to start with first?

[00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:00.820]
Whichever one I like.

[00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:03.100]
Here in Cuban Central,

[00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:04.160]
weapon beaching.

[00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:06.200]
And I just,

[00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:08.400]
I can't even whistle one fundamental without

[00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:09.120]
people looking at me.

[00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:10.800]
Because I'm a white looking Latino.

[00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:12.700]
And that.

[00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:17.360]
I want to add Haitians to the list.

[00:38:17.780 --> 00:38:18.700]
Because they can't,

[00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:21.560]
they don't have the same Cuban rule where they put the toe in the crease

[00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:23.060]
or the toe in the stand and

[00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:24.540]
brought the line to can't get in.

[00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:24.760]
So.

[00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:25.200]
It's a good point.

[00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:27.520]
I'm doing great.

[00:38:27.980 --> 00:38:28.420]
Yeah, I do.

[00:38:28.460 --> 00:38:28.960]
You're up there.

[00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:29.940]
I'm, I'm, yeah.

[00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:30.720]
miserable.

[00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:31.700]
Sorry pal.

[00:38:32.220 --> 00:38:32.420]
Thanks.

[00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:35.180]
Better you than me.

[00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:36.600]
Let's put Haitians on there.

[00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:37.120]
And what about,

[00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:39.080]
what about Jamaican?

[00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:39.420]
Yeah,

[00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:41.340]
I would really put them give them some recognition

[00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:42.520]
to cut off your supply.

[00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:45.480]
Let's get the Haitians and the Jamaican.

[00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:47.280]
Yeah, yeah, for damn sure.

[00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:50.440]
You know, that's another,

[00:38:50.660 --> 00:38:51.880]
that's an excellent pull question.

[00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:52.820]
I don't think we've ever done.

[00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:58.080]
I'm, and I just thought of the Jamaican thing.

[00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:00.000]
I don't know how you phrased it correctly,

[00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:02.700]
but what ethnic or religious or racial group do you have the most

[00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:03.580]
difficulty with?

[00:39:04.460 --> 00:39:04.800]
That's good.

[00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:06.020]
That's not worded well.

[00:39:06.020 --> 00:39:06.760]
But you know, you know,

[00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:07.440]
I'm going with that.

[00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:08.640]
I get the jizz of that.

[00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:10.320]
Because I'm thinking Jamaicans, man, I just,

[00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:11.120]
I don't know what it is.

[00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:12.000]
Maybe I have bad luck.

[00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:15.380]
Maybe I just don't meet a nice Jamaicans.

[00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:16.780]
Because most of them just have that,

[00:39:16.780 --> 00:39:18.100]
especially the women I've mentioned this,

[00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:19.820]
at least 20 million times.

[00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:20.760]
Not 30 million.

[00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:21.540]
30 million times.

[00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:24.900]
That imperious kind of condescending hostile attitude.

[00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:25.600]
And that whole,

[00:39:25.940 --> 00:39:28.600]
that whole affected the speech pattern,

[00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:29.600]
that whole thing, that pet,

[00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:30.540]
whatever that is,

[00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:32.060]
makes me want to burp.

[00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:32.600]
Yeah, mine.

[00:39:33.380 --> 00:39:34.600]
What is, no, not the amine.

[00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:35.700]
You know what I'm talking about?

[00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:36.800]
Yeah, correct.

[00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:37.680]
You know, who else does that?

[00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:38.900]
Even my friend Clifton Pullman.

[00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:40.180]
I don't know what he's from one of

[00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:41.280]
the other islands there, man.

[00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:42.540]
Orators.

[00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:44.000]
Oh, I don't know.

[00:39:44.020 --> 00:39:44.900]
No, it worse than that.

[00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:45.780]
Bahamas.

[00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:47.260]
Some place that Celia once

[00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:47.760]
visited.

[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:49.260]
One dynamite.

[00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:50.180]
Yeah, maybe in Gitmo.

[00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:54.160]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60,

[00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:55.240]
pound 5, 60,

[00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:56.820]
auto AT and T in Verizon.

[00:39:57.200 --> 00:39:58.000]
Wireless line.

[00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:01.140]
Just like Mickey told Eisner,

[00:40:01.140 --> 00:40:03.360]
I'd be very careful next time I started your car.

[00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:06.080]
Here's Fort Lauderdale.

[00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:06.360]
Hello.

[00:40:07.020 --> 00:40:07.420]
Hey.

[00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:08.420]
Yes, sir.

[00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:10.520]
I wanted to add Jamaican,

[00:40:10.620 --> 00:40:12.020]
but you read my mind.

[00:40:12.140 --> 00:40:13.120]
I'm either the punch.

[00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:13.560]
That's right.

[00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:15.300]
Everything you just said,

[00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:17.440]
oh my god, I used to work with Jamaicans.

[00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:19.580]
Yeah, they have this attitude,

[00:40:19.580 --> 00:40:21.000]
this air about them.

[00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:23.020]
It's like, if I fart,

[00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:24.680]
you better smell my ass.

[00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:26.420]
Right, that's what Peter Boy said this morning.

[00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:27.340]
His parts don't stink.

[00:40:27.340 --> 00:40:28.420]
That's the way they are, Phil.

[00:40:28.780 --> 00:40:31.560]
Oh, man, I'm telling you.

[00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:33.120]
But yeah, give me a vote.

[00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:34.980]
For Haitians and Jamaicans.

[00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:35.900]
OK, man.

[00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:37.260]
Thanks, Uncle.

[00:40:37.700 --> 00:40:38.200]
Uncle, man.

[00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:38.600]
Uncle, man.

[00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:39.800]
OK, see, what are my name?

[00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:40.840]
Uncle Remus.

[00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:48.160]
91 for black, 73 for Cubans, only 23 for the Jews.

[00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:50.120]
We're always getting to our changed.

[00:40:50.820 --> 00:40:52.040]
Or maybe we're just getting a wholesale.

[00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:54.360]
Seven for Chinese, five for Canada.

[00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:56.240]
We got to get the Jamaicans and Haitians on it.

[00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:57.600]
It'll spice it up just a little bit.

[00:40:58.820 --> 00:41:00.200]
A little salsa to it.

[00:41:02.860 --> 00:41:04.200]
Ha, ha.

[00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:08.980]
For the life of me, I just, I know there are people like jazz,

[00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:11.440]
there are people like really a hard acid rock,

[00:41:11.900 --> 00:41:12.380]
Hasidic rock.

[00:41:13.220 --> 00:41:15.080]
But salsa, I just don't get it.

[00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:16.160]
What is the appeal of that?

[00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:17.700]
It's a dance to it.

[00:41:18.220 --> 00:41:19.060]
Yeah, right.

[00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:22.120]
And when it stands to well, it looks amazing.

[00:41:23.020 --> 00:41:24.060]
Yeah, OK.

[00:41:25.340 --> 00:41:26.600]
Whatever you say, Beanervoy,

[00:41:26.700 --> 00:41:28.640]
see, he's really enthusiastic about this because

[00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:30.620]
it's come to find out that he's even more Cuban centric

[00:41:30.620 --> 00:41:32.660]
than Miguel that he was two and half the other day.

[00:41:32.660 --> 00:41:34.260]
He was two and a man asked Tuesday.

[00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:35.400]
Really?

[00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:37.000]
Well, I just like to do a picture of that.

[00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:38.500]
Yeah, you like to dance.

[00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:39.660]
Oh, God.

[00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:40.480]
Here's Miami.

[00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:42.280]
This might be the color of the waiting for Miami.

[00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:42.660]
Hello.

[00:41:43.580 --> 00:41:43.940]
Neil.

[00:41:44.220 --> 00:41:44.780]
Yes, sir.

[00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:48.460]
Hey, man, actually, I kind of do you

[00:41:48.460 --> 00:41:49.860]
wouldn't like selling a cruise?

[00:41:50.340 --> 00:41:52.160]
Yeah, because well, number one,

[00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:53.960]
she's black and she's Cuban.

[00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:54.420]
I don't know.

[00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:55.140]
You don't like Cuban.

[00:41:55.620 --> 00:41:56.660]
Well, based on what?

[00:41:56.800 --> 00:41:57.700]
What do you mean I don't like humans?

[00:41:58.340 --> 00:41:59.220]
No, you don't like anything.

[00:41:59.220 --> 00:42:00.340]
You know, it's a plane about them.

[00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:01.880]
You know, I got to.

[00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:03.820]
Why are you sitting there on the other end of the line here?

[00:42:03.860 --> 00:42:04.660]
What are you talking about?

[00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:06.280]
Yeah, you parade them all the time.

[00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:08.000]
I'd be raiding them for being Cuban.

[00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:11.000]
You know, I, you want to hear.

[00:42:11.580 --> 00:42:13.980]
Why couldn't you be in that house of Oude and Cousin?

[00:42:14.100 --> 00:42:14.960]
Why weren't you in there?

[00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:17.260]
Apple.

[00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:21.680]
I just want to take the pause long and let me get it in there.

[00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:23.400]
Hey, buddy, this is the kind of stuff.

[00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:24.720]
260 to be exact.

[00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:28.200]
Which ethnic religious or racial group is the most overly sensitive?

[00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:30.700]
Blacks 103, Cuban 75,

[00:42:30.700 --> 00:42:33.080]
that last asshole, I'm not sure what he was, just an asshole.

[00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:35.180]
He has 5,000 votes in my book.

[00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:40.140]
Jews 23, Chinese 7, Catholic 6, redness 1, Haitians 1,

[00:42:40.420 --> 00:42:41.700]
and I'm sure that you're making it yet.

[00:42:43.340 --> 00:42:45.120]
But your day is coming in the sunshine.

[00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:45.940]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:42:46.140 --> 00:42:46.960]
No, there's a day is coming.

[00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:50.180]
Here's a call from Miami.

[00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:50.480]
Hello.

[00:42:50.740 --> 00:42:51.240]
When is the US?

[00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:53.360]
Hello?

[00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:54.200]
Yes, sir.

[00:42:54.380 --> 00:42:54.700]
Hey, we're on.

[00:42:54.840 --> 00:42:58.100]
Just wanted to make some comments on the study of cruise deaf.

[00:42:58.100 --> 00:43:02.380]
I think your choice of humor is taste list.

[00:43:02.700 --> 00:43:06.780]
And it's just not funny.

[00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:09.900]
That she is a Cuban idol and she is the queen of self-so.

[00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:12.820]
I would never make any jokes about a dead person.

[00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:13.740]
And I just think it's funny.

[00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:14.780]
Why not?

[00:43:15.580 --> 00:43:17.220]
Because it's not a funny thing, Neil.

[00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:19.440]
It's, you know, especially you not being Cuban.

[00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:20.280]
You wouldn't understand.

[00:43:20.620 --> 00:43:23.020]
It's like, you know, it's just staring up.

[00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:25.680]
Shit, and it's not.

[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:26.720]
That's great.

[00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:27.180]
Okay.

[00:43:27.620 --> 00:43:28.340]
That's the end of him.

[00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:28.660]
Yeah.

[00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:29.040]
Get that.

[00:43:30.580 --> 00:43:31.140]
Too bad.

[00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:32.480]
Because I was in, let's you make your point.

[00:43:32.580 --> 00:43:34.200]
But then you had to have blurred out Mierda on the ear,

[00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:35.300]
which I'm not putting on the ear.

[00:43:35.540 --> 00:43:36.260]
He could have said Mierda.

[00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:37.280]
He could have said that.

[00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:37.980]
I'd let that go.

[00:43:38.180 --> 00:43:39.840]
Because the FCC don't speak it upon him.

[00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:42.120]
And that's throwing up anything.

[00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:44.400]
I'm just, we've had plenty of other people have died

[00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:45.340]
and we've joked about it.

[00:43:45.420 --> 00:43:46.440]
I mean, you know, once somebody's dead,

[00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:47.780]
it's not going to hurt their feelings anymore.

[00:43:48.180 --> 00:43:49.920]
But again, this guy wants to prove,

[00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:52.780]
I guess he's upset that the black somebody had a Cubans on our pool.

[00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:54.000]
He wants to boost that up a little bit,

[00:43:54.060 --> 00:43:55.460]
that quotient on the pool.

[00:43:55.460 --> 00:43:57.140]
And I thought you did a good job there, sir.

[00:43:57.340 --> 00:43:58.100]
It's not the only one.

[00:43:58.220 --> 00:43:59.460]
And I took a bird of that out.

[00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:00.200]
Right.

[00:44:02.100 --> 00:44:03.880]
Just throwing up crap and it's tasteless.

[00:44:04.060 --> 00:44:05.660]
I mean, think of all the other people who have died,

[00:44:05.660 --> 00:44:06.560]
that we've, you know,

[00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:07.600]
while she was an icon.

[00:44:07.820 --> 00:44:09.680]
And how about people who are icons in a white community?

[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:11.480]
How about like when Strom Thurmond died,

[00:44:11.580 --> 00:44:12.920]
he was an icon in the red that community.

[00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:14.540]
They read that's calling bitching about that.

[00:44:14.620 --> 00:44:14.820]
No.

[00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:17.420]
If that's true, it's a die.

[00:44:18.420 --> 00:44:19.600]
And we were going to make fun of my shirt.

[00:44:19.620 --> 00:44:20.740]
Sure, you have no problem.

[00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:23.540]
Are you comparing, I see the cruise to Fidel Castro?

[00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:25.960]
Just the beard.

[00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:29.720]
You know that baby blue car that you drive?

[00:44:30.740 --> 00:44:31.460]
That baby blue.

[00:44:31.860 --> 00:44:33.760]
That would be real, real cautious.

[00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:36.040]
Next time George started your car for you.

[00:44:36.180 --> 00:44:36.840]
I mean, baby red.

[00:44:36.980 --> 00:44:37.380]
Baby red.

[00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:37.980]
It's a red car.

[00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:39.160]
I get a mirror on us.

[00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:39.680]
Baby blue.

[00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:40.380]
You're a little bit more like a carless.

[00:44:40.820 --> 00:44:41.680]
Baby blue azul.

[00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:42.340]
Okay.

[00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:45.460]
Drive that right across the bay to

[00:44:46.860 --> 00:44:48.280]
is what my suggestion is,

[00:44:48.340 --> 00:44:50.320]
into a real fast before your time runs out.

[00:44:52.020 --> 00:44:52.760]
You're a little push.

[00:44:54.220 --> 00:44:55.020]
It's tasteful.

[00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:56.820]
I'm just having a little bit of fun with it.

[00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:57.060]
Okay.

[00:44:57.160 --> 00:44:57.920]
That in fact, that isn't me.

[00:44:58.100 --> 00:44:58.660]
Look at this.

[00:44:58.720 --> 00:44:59.620]
Here's a horrible story.

[00:45:00.140 --> 00:45:01.200]
We could dwell on this all day.

[00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:03.620]
Three US soldiers killed in Iraq for the evidence

[00:45:03.620 --> 00:45:05.760]
that the insurgency hasn't waned.

[00:45:06.580 --> 00:45:08.400]
Three American soldiers were killed today

[00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:09.960]
when their convo was hit by gunfire

[00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:11.620]
and rocket propelled grenades in northern Iraq.

[00:45:12.140 --> 00:45:13.360]
The killings were further signed

[00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:14.960]
at an insurgency against American troops

[00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:16.160]
as not losing strength,

[00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:17.780]
as Washington hoped after the death

[00:45:17.780 --> 00:45:19.400]
Tuesday of Sodom Hussein's son,

[00:45:19.820 --> 00:45:20.480]
Udi and Puse.

[00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:22.080]
How do you like that?

[00:45:22.580 --> 00:45:24.260]
I thought all the problems would be over.

[00:45:24.580 --> 00:45:24.960]
Right.

[00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:26.440]
Didn't work.

[00:45:26.780 --> 00:45:28.380]
Didn't take the heat off either, uh, W.

[00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:30.040]
You watch.

[00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:31.320]
His impeachment day is coming.

[00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:32.120]
You mark my words.

[00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:32.520]
Okay.

[00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:33.100]
Don't tease.

[00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:34.980]
His impeachment day is coming.

[00:45:36.760 --> 00:45:38.640]
1056 at 560 WQM.

[00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:39.600]
Here's something you ought to be having

[00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:40.920]
in your purse and that's Oliomid.

[00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:42.620]
Oliomid, so if you'll contain

[00:45:42.620 --> 00:45:44.700]
the finest olive oil you've ever had in your body,

[00:45:44.700 --> 00:45:47.340]
not just ordinary everyday pedestrian olive oil,

[00:45:47.340 --> 00:45:48.040]
like no name,

[00:45:48.260 --> 00:45:49.180]
but super concentrated,

[00:45:49.180 --> 00:45:50.260]
loaded with health benefits.

[00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:51.400]
Oliomid, every day,

[00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:53.400]
can up produce the risk of all kinds of nasty things,

[00:45:53.580 --> 00:45:54.420]
like heart disease,

[00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:55.480]
duff and high cholesterol.

[00:45:55.900 --> 00:45:57.680]
Plus, there are 14 different Oliomid formulas

[00:45:57.680 --> 00:45:59.180]
to choose from each one from binding,

[00:45:59.560 --> 00:46:00.720]
the finest, the purest,

[00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:02.140]
the best olive oil you've ever heard of

[00:46:02.140 --> 00:46:02.580]
with vitamins,

[00:46:02.780 --> 00:46:03.380]
minerals and herbals

[00:46:03.380 --> 00:46:05.100]
to support specific parts of your health,

[00:46:05.100 --> 00:46:05.760]
like your bones,

[00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:06.820]
to your blood pressure,

[00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:07.500]
your immune system,

[00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:08.060]
and lots more.

one after you can show your weight

[00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:17.740]
and sell Q10 for your heart.

[00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:19.060]
Pick some up today at Publix,

that's 1-866-6536-333.

in your push every day.

My high and local

[00:46:38.580 --> 00:46:41.060]
year sports radio 560s,

[00:46:41.100 --> 00:46:41.420]
you ain't

[00:46:41.420 --> 00:46:42.580]
you ain't

[00:46:44.580 --> 00:46:45.860]
Trangilando el pollo para acá.

[00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:52.560]
The normal yellow people.

[00:46:56.260 --> 00:46:58.240]
This one to the sound of

[00:46:58.240 --> 00:46:59.160]
Gondra falling

[00:46:59.160 --> 00:46:59.720]
play,

[00:47:00.460 --> 00:47:02.920]
all going into the scene.

[00:47:03.180 --> 00:47:03.360]
One,

[00:47:03.580 --> 00:47:03.860]
one,

[00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:04.300]
one,

[00:47:04.300 --> 00:47:04.520]
one,

[00:47:04.520 --> 00:47:04.560]
one,

[00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:05.880]
big of both female

[00:47:05.880 --> 00:47:07.880]
and they're like J.F.K.

[00:47:08.840 --> 00:47:09.040]
Good,

[00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:09.580]
a poor,

[00:47:09.700 --> 00:47:10.280]
a better

[00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:10.860]
play,

[00:47:11.320 --> 00:47:11.520]
hurt.

[00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:13.680]
If J.F.K.

[00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:14.360]
at four times,

[00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:15.040]
I'd be

[00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:16.120]
would have known

[00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:18.180]
a five-foot-of-the-cheap

[00:47:18.180 --> 00:47:18.820]
and crappy

[00:47:18.820 --> 00:47:20.160]
play that flow.

[00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:21.500]
I've got a

[00:47:21.500 --> 00:47:22.280]
step my head

[00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:24.120]
about the only way

[00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:25.420]
I would go.

[00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:30.500]
Now, head to the only one

[00:47:30.500 --> 00:47:31.560]
that's left the life

[00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:32.180]
today.

[00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:33.980]
From what they call

[00:47:33.980 --> 00:47:35.540]
the Kennedy curse,

[00:47:36.840 --> 00:47:37.800]
if Doris

[00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:38.760]
he'd kill Gallon

[00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:39.660]
was a life

[00:47:39.660 --> 00:47:40.520]
she'd say,

[00:47:40.940 --> 00:47:42.240]
here up it's only

[00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:43.520]
gonna get worse.

[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:45.780]
I've said

[00:47:45.780 --> 00:47:46.900]
you the sound of

[00:47:47.020 --> 00:47:47.520]
Gallon Gallon

[00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:48.460]
is a

[00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:50.720]
four-foot-of-the-cheap

[00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:51.720]
flutter-foot-of-the-cheap

[00:47:51.720 --> 00:47:53.020]
flutter-foot-of-the-cheap

[00:47:54.460 --> 00:47:55.680]
flutter-foot-of-the-cheap

[00:47:55.680 --> 00:47:56.600]
flutter-foot-of-the-cheap

[00:47:57.700 --> 00:47:58.820]
flutter-foot-of-the-cheap

[00:47:58.820 --> 00:48:01.020]
flutter-foot-of-the-cheap

[00:48:01.020 --> 00:48:01.420]
with the cancer

[00:48:01.420 --> 00:48:02.140]
hearse was not

[00:48:02.140 --> 00:48:02.720]
I'd play in it's

[00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:03.540]
level two at five

[00:48:03.540 --> 00:48:04.120]
sixty-two

[00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:04.780]
to Q.A.M.

[00:48:04.860 --> 00:48:05.420]
See, I

[00:48:05.420 --> 00:48:06.100]
played that

[00:48:06.100 --> 00:48:06.620]
because that's one

[00:48:06.620 --> 00:48:07.140]
example

[00:48:07.820 --> 00:48:09.400]
of I can play dozens

[00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:10.340]
maybe that's what I'll do

[00:48:10.340 --> 00:48:10.900]
all day today

[00:48:10.900 --> 00:48:11.420]
with a little time

[00:48:11.420 --> 00:48:11.740]
we've got

[00:48:11.740 --> 00:48:12.780]
is every break

[00:48:12.780 --> 00:48:13.580]
when we play a comedy

[00:48:13.580 --> 00:48:14.080]
bit it'll be

[00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:14.560]
something about

[00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:15.440]
somebody who died

[00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:16.800]
an American icon

[00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:17.840]
or at least supposedly

[00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:18.880]
like J.F.K.

[00:48:18.940 --> 00:48:19.100]
Jr.

[00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:20.080]
right, don't forget the

[00:48:20.080 --> 00:48:20.780]
goodbye series

[00:48:20.780 --> 00:48:21.780]
we have eight of those

[00:48:21.780 --> 00:48:22.060]
alone

[00:48:22.060 --> 00:48:23.400]
now but most of those

[00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:24.380]
are making fun of people

[00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:26.160]
most of those are like

[00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:27.300]
heartfelt all of the

[00:48:27.300 --> 00:48:27.680]
sonopera

[00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:28.600]
there's another class

[00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:29.060]
of his life

[00:48:29.820 --> 00:48:30.380]
that's the

[00:48:30.380 --> 00:48:31.980]
hurtive example right there

[00:48:31.980 --> 00:48:32.440]
okay

[00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:33.420]
I've been ripping

[00:48:33.420 --> 00:48:34.080]
Frank Sinatra

[00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:34.820]
ass

[00:48:34.820 --> 00:48:36.400]
for as long as I can remember

[00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:37.300]
okay could he sing

[00:48:37.300 --> 00:48:37.900]
was he

[00:48:37.900 --> 00:48:39.180]
involved with a bunch of

[00:48:39.180 --> 00:48:40.000]
gangsters who made his

[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:40.780]
career for him

[00:48:40.780 --> 00:48:41.580]
that's still in the

[00:48:41.580 --> 00:48:41.980]
godfather

[00:48:41.980 --> 00:48:42.820]
about him in the

[00:48:42.820 --> 00:48:43.680]
Tommy Dorsey band

[00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:44.280]
yes

[00:48:44.860 --> 00:48:46.100]
now let me ask you this

[00:48:46.100 --> 00:48:46.780]
who do you think

[00:48:46.780 --> 00:48:47.140]
in the

[00:48:47.140 --> 00:48:47.460]
in the

[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:49.080]
scheme of things

[00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:51.380]
was a greater icon

[00:48:51.380 --> 00:48:52.160]
forget about ethnic

[00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:52.600]
background

[00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:53.020]
no quite

[00:48:53.020 --> 00:48:54.000]
in the history of the world

[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:54.760]
Frank Sinatra

[00:48:54.760 --> 00:48:56.240]
or Sanya Cruz okay

[00:48:56.240 --> 00:48:57.000]
Frank yeah

[00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:57.660]
Frank is

[00:48:57.660 --> 00:48:58.060]
all this

[00:48:58.060 --> 00:48:58.260]
lot

[00:48:58.260 --> 00:48:58.640]
dummy up

[00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:00.080]
Sinatra

[00:49:00.080 --> 00:49:00.620]
see what I'm saying

[00:49:00.620 --> 00:49:00.900]
sure

[00:49:01.480 --> 00:49:02.680]
we did anybody call

[00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:03.800]
all look at all the

[00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:04.720]
Frank Sinatra bits

[00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:05.200]
that we've got

[00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:06.200]
one foot in the grave

[00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:07.600]
goodbye all blue eyes

[00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:08.960]
strange things in my box

[00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:10.760]
exactly strange things in his

[00:49:10.760 --> 00:49:11.080]
box

[00:49:12.940 --> 00:49:13.840]
including a picture

[00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:14.720]
of a gorilla face

[00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:17.360]
nobody ever called

[00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:18.180]
in made death

[00:49:18.180 --> 00:49:18.940]
reds are got all been

[00:49:18.940 --> 00:49:19.360]
out of shape

[00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:20.360]
see because generally

[00:49:20.360 --> 00:49:21.280]
most people have a sense

[00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:22.020]
of humor but when it

[00:49:22.020 --> 00:49:22.940]
comes into an ethnic

[00:49:22.940 --> 00:49:23.260]
thing

[00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:23.540]
they're like

[00:49:23.540 --> 00:49:25.280]
oh my god you know

[00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:26.400]
in fact even with all

[00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:27.300]
the black stuff that I

[00:49:27.300 --> 00:49:28.360]
play other than one

[00:49:28.360 --> 00:49:29.220]
episode which was

[00:49:29.220 --> 00:49:30.360]
by a bunch of outside

[00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:30.960]
agitators

[00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:31.960]
it had nothing to do

[00:49:31.960 --> 00:49:32.540]
with anybody in the

[00:49:32.540 --> 00:49:33.700]
community any black people

[00:49:33.700 --> 00:49:34.180]

float area

[00:49:34.820 --> 00:49:36.120]
uh but other than that

[00:49:36.120 --> 00:49:36.780]
you know we don't

[00:49:36.780 --> 00:49:37.760]
get complaints about that

[00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:38.080]
stuff

[00:49:39.720 --> 00:49:40.480]

a collection

[00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:45.740]
abracurant we have to wait

[00:49:45.740 --> 00:49:46.680]
for an icon to die

[00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:47.700]

[00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:03.940]
overly sensitive

[00:50:20.500 --> 00:50:22.000]
one of those traitor parts in

[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:22.300]
miramar

[00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:25.420]
hello

[00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:27.940]
good morning now

[00:50:27.940 --> 00:50:28.820]
when is this

[00:50:28.820 --> 00:50:31.460]
hi um i definitely think it's

[00:50:31.460 --> 00:50:31.760]
the black

[00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:33.900]
uh that's for sure

[00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:35.720]
and then just uh just

[00:50:35.720 --> 00:50:37.240]
a little thing i like to talk

[00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:38.180]
about regarding

[00:50:38.180 --> 00:50:39.940]
what's going on in iwak

[00:50:40.860 --> 00:50:41.560]
are you there

[00:50:41.560 --> 00:50:42.520]
i'm here i'm

[00:50:42.520 --> 00:50:43.880]
listening with big red

[00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:45.340]
i think the whole thing is a

[00:50:45.340 --> 00:50:46.000]
smoke screen

[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:47.100]
what we've been doing

[00:50:47.100 --> 00:50:48.420]
you know going these

[00:50:48.420 --> 00:50:49.580]
countries and blowing them up

[00:50:50.540 --> 00:50:52.060]
i think what's happening is

[00:50:52.060 --> 00:50:53.040]
because the middle east

[00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:55.020]
he hates israel

[00:50:55.020 --> 00:50:56.580]
and we protect israel

[00:50:57.220 --> 00:50:58.600]
i think that's why we went in there

[00:50:58.600 --> 00:50:59.220]
because it's no

[00:50:59.220 --> 00:51:00.220]
wait wait wait wait wait

[00:51:00.220 --> 00:51:01.500]
let's listen to what you just said

[00:51:01.500 --> 00:51:03.840]
he hates israel and we protect israel

[00:51:03.840 --> 00:51:04.980]
who's he

[00:51:06.260 --> 00:51:07.360]
okay he i'm sorry

[00:51:07.360 --> 00:51:09.280]
the president or the u.s

[00:51:10.280 --> 00:51:12.280]
we so we give them money left

[00:51:12.280 --> 00:51:14.980]
right in center uh the middle east

[00:51:14.980 --> 00:51:16.480]
because we hate israel therefore we

[00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:17.100]
give them money

[00:51:17.100 --> 00:51:19.060]
no the middle east hates israel

[00:51:19.060 --> 00:51:19.740]
yeah

[00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:23.300]
so that that's where the problems are

[00:51:23.300 --> 00:51:24.060]
stemming from

[00:51:24.060 --> 00:51:24.820]
that's why

[00:51:25.440 --> 00:51:26.740]
everybody hates us in the world

[00:51:26.740 --> 00:51:28.040]
off meaning the u.s

[00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:30.460]
because we're we're supporting

[00:51:30.460 --> 00:51:31.380]
israel

[00:51:31.380 --> 00:51:33.540]
because i'm tired so everybody

[00:51:33.540 --> 00:51:34.180]
hates to do it

[00:51:34.180 --> 00:51:35.060]
okay thank you

i wanted to add the rudest group of

[00:52:13.980 --> 00:52:15.360]
people to your list which would be

[00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:16.720]
in my opinion the canadian

[00:52:18.340 --> 00:52:20.480]
that said we're not asking who's the

[00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:21.020]
rudest

[00:52:21.020 --> 00:52:21.840]
okay

[00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:23.560]
in addition to what you're talking about

[00:52:23.560 --> 00:52:24.940]
french canadian because it so

[00:52:24.940 --> 00:52:26.400]
happens that outside of a Quebec

[00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:27.880]
canadians are probably some of the

[00:52:27.880 --> 00:52:29.220]
most polite people on the face of the

[00:52:29.220 --> 00:52:29.540]
earth

[00:52:29.540 --> 00:52:31.080]
except when they come down here

[00:52:31.080 --> 00:52:32.540]
let me let me say it again

[00:52:32.540 --> 00:52:33.980]
except for the french canadian see

[00:52:33.980 --> 00:52:35.520]

[00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:41.320]
them all this money we heard that from

[00:52:41.320 --> 00:52:42.040]
the previous guy

[00:52:42.540 --> 00:52:44.180]
because the middle east is uh a

[00:52:44.180 --> 00:52:45.720]
quagmire or some crap like that

[00:52:45.720 --> 00:52:47.160]

[00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:47.660]
at-box

[00:52:48.720 --> 00:52:50.060]
and then we got this guy

[00:52:50.060 --> 00:52:52.140]
to tell us that the canadians are

[00:52:52.140 --> 00:52:53.600]

[00:52:53.600 --> 00:52:55.860]

the face of the globe and don't

[00:52:58.960 --> 00:53:00.920]

we got the big moulson whatever the

[00:53:03.420 --> 00:53:04.360]
hell of the name of that is uh with

[00:53:04.360 --> 00:53:05.400]
the stones and everybody else

[00:53:05.400 --> 00:53:06.180]
the guess who

[00:53:07.820 --> 00:53:09.040]
who else is going to be in it rush

[00:53:09.940 --> 00:53:11.780]
acdc just to think about and a bunch

[00:53:11.780 --> 00:53:13.280]
of other people and the isolated

[00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:14.320]
brothers what's left of them

[00:53:15.240 --> 00:53:17.260]
on july 30th but you ought to see the

[00:53:17.260 --> 00:53:18.640]
the hassle they've been having here

[00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:21.940]
first first the uh powers that be

[00:53:21.940 --> 00:53:24.500]
here the police they started laying

[00:53:24.500 --> 00:53:25.620]
on all these rules you can't bring

[00:53:25.620 --> 00:53:26.920]
coolers and you can because they're

[00:53:26.920 --> 00:53:27.720]
going to have like about a half

[00:53:27.720 --> 00:53:28.820]
a million people there maybe more

[00:53:28.820 --> 00:53:31.260]
okay and you can't do this and you can't

[00:53:31.260 --> 00:53:32.360]
do that and then of course everybody

[00:53:32.360 --> 00:53:33.960]
started getting really sour on that

[00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:35.000]
and the media started making a big

[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:36.760]
think about that well if you know

[00:53:36.760 --> 00:53:38.060]
why even bother going if you can't

[00:53:38.060 --> 00:53:39.940]
have any fun so they finally

[00:53:39.940 --> 00:53:41.660]
backtracked on a lot of that stuff

[00:53:42.820 --> 00:53:44.100]
and then they were trying to say well

[00:53:44.100 --> 00:53:45.560]
the stones might actually pull out

[00:53:45.560 --> 00:53:47.180]
you know a lot of hype a lot of crap

[00:53:47.180 --> 00:53:49.120]
like that now they're saying now they're

[00:53:49.120 --> 00:53:50.840]
going so far as to say well we know

[00:53:50.840 --> 00:53:51.680]
there's going to be a lot of people

[00:53:51.680 --> 00:53:52.960]
smoking a wacky weed there we're

[00:53:52.960 --> 00:53:54.140]
just going to look the other way i

[00:53:55.240 --> 00:53:56.580]
mean it's one thing to do it but it's

[00:53:56.580 --> 00:53:57.560]
nothing to come out and actually

[00:53:57.560 --> 00:53:59.500]
announce it in fact they might even have

[00:53:59.500 --> 00:54:01.580]

[00:57:39.020 --> 00:57:41.560]
Kennedy fn way and what the hell did he ever do

[00:57:48.140 --> 00:57:49.780]
invent a job to have something to do

[00:57:49.780 --> 00:57:51.980]

she was a good actress but i thought she was highly

[00:57:58.220 --> 00:58:00.580]
overrated and uh you know we have the jimmy

[00:58:00.580 --> 00:58:02.120]

[00:58:07.880 --> 00:58:09.680]

[00:58:16.300 --> 00:58:17.660]
faulty for this because he's got a big

[00:58:17.660 --> 00:58:19.220]

so we'll have to do ten o'clock tomorrow evening the whole report it'll be probably

[01:05:51.700 --> 01:05:53.500]
a little bit anticlimactic wouldn't you think

[01:05:54.300 --> 01:05:58.220]
now what you say that i mean although there are a lot of stations where they

[01:05:58.220 --> 01:06:01.560]
don't tell their uh... the paid help what the numbers are but we don't play that

[01:06:01.560 --> 01:06:04.700]

this thing i know is from now did you talk about this at length or not at all

[01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:08.860]
about the report we had it on our website thanks to bonerboy

[01:14:08.860 --> 01:14:12.540]
but more than a more than a thousand victims of abuse in the Boston art

[01:14:12.540 --> 01:14:15.400]
sticies right we mentioned it and pointed them to the website

[01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:20.360]
over six decades likely more than a thousand people were molested by Roman Catholic priest

[01:14:20.360 --> 01:14:24.600]
and church workers while leaders in the Boston art sticies engage in a massive and

[01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:28.800]
excusable failure to do anything about it the massive 20 general seven report Wednesday

[01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:31.500]
that outlines the result of a lengthy criminal investigation

[01:14:33.580 --> 01:14:37.320]
whether consider this is this is the part i like the best the sentence

[01:14:37.980 --> 01:14:40.860]
whether considering the number of victims or the number of accused priest

[01:14:40.860 --> 01:14:45.840]
the magnitude of the art sticies history of clergy sexual abuse of children is staggering

[01:14:46.380 --> 01:14:50.600]
mass attorney general tom riley said in his report the mispronement of children was so

[01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:53.720]
massive and so prolonged that it borders on the unbelievable

[01:14:53.720 --> 01:14:58.780]
for the way he said how do you like that for those people who kept trying to come up with that

[01:14:58.780 --> 01:15:03.300]

[01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:57.740]
will understand i mean what's an american right what is an american any number of these things i

[01:17:57.740 --> 01:18:01.360]
mean a native american is an indian you know you can go play the assemble bingo that that's a

[01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:05.560]
native americans everybody else is like from someplace else that's why i keep saying the thing with

[01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:11.760]
the labels it makes me want a barf okay listen i live part of the year right here in a great city

[01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:16.820]
where the people the five-minute people they generally get along we don't have any ghettos i mean

[01:18:16.820 --> 01:18:21.260]
there's some neighborhoods that aren't as good as others but we don't have any ghettos and of course

[01:18:21.260 --> 01:18:25.920]
a lot of the violent crime which is increasing as thanks to guns being smuggled across the border

[01:18:25.920 --> 01:18:31.360]
mostly from detroit i'm not getting a lot of the thing about it but you can just use your imagination

[01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:36.380]
that's where most of the crime is coming from which is just a fraction of what i remember the story

[01:18:36.380 --> 01:18:42.660]
i had that day about detroit and winzer now about all the differences the differences between the

[01:18:42.660 --> 01:18:47.020]
stats there people killed by guns and detroit winzer which are right across the ambassador bridge

[01:18:47.020 --> 01:18:52.300]
right across the border and they and they adjusted the stats you know for population is obviously

[01:18:52.300 --> 01:18:56.680]
detroit's much bigger than winzer but i mean it was staggering it was just unbelievable

[01:18:57.220 --> 01:19:01.200]
and the reason that more people aren't getting killed by guns here is because most people don't

[01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:06.280]
have them a most people don't want them a i just mentioned that in passing especially as compared

[01:19:06.280 --> 01:19:10.960]
to america where now there are as many guns as there are people it's about 280 million people

[01:19:10.960 --> 01:19:16.180]
and there's 280 million guns well the time like this guy in New York yesterday nobody's talking

[01:19:16.180 --> 01:19:21.940]
about that i noticed right see that that's a new deal in american politics if you can't beat him

[01:19:21.940 --> 01:19:28.020]
shoot him yeah this guy was gonna run for office against this york guy and you know if you

[01:19:28.020 --> 01:19:31.620]
get this is an easier way eliminate him that's like the good old days of politics

[01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:41.740]
i was just getting your grips in that right 20 i was getting choked up about for sure you

[01:19:43.160 --> 01:19:48.120]
oh seriously i don't want to like make fun of her well sure i do but no but i mean why would

[01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:52.520]

[01:23:32.940 --> 01:23:38.060]
1147 at 560 wqm I think maybe I phrased my question wrong today maybe a better question would have

[01:23:38.060 --> 01:23:42.960]
been instead of who's most overly sensitive which group is most emotional

[01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:48.180]
because I think that's really the key to this whole city of cruise historian

[01:23:48.180 --> 01:23:56.500]
safforda is the hysterical he's like a conny in a godfather she's hysterical

[01:24:04.700 --> 01:24:07.420]
that's enough sweetheart put the lid on it on the box

[01:24:08.800 --> 01:24:13.140]
173 say blacks are the ethnic religious or racial group that are most overly sensitive

[01:24:13.920 --> 01:24:18.640]
I don't know how you can say that well I mean if this certain things certain things right you always

[01:24:18.640 --> 01:24:22.640]
got to Jesse Jackson's popping up any else sharpens and making things into a racial issue that

[01:24:22.640 --> 01:24:27.280]
really aren't and things like that everybody's got their certain things but generally speaking I

[01:24:27.280 --> 01:24:31.900]
don't think you're average your schwarf sir I mean a black person is like all that Cubans 132 they

[01:24:31.900 --> 01:24:36.580]
got my vote because after spending all these years in safforda can there be any doubt no now you

[01:24:36.580 --> 01:24:44.100]
voted for blacks me yeah I voted for Irish oh some of the words you're not saying I voted for blacks

[01:24:44.900 --> 01:24:51.280]
how could you do that oh Jay think of the things that have come up not necessarily here locally which

[01:24:51.280 --> 01:24:56.620]
I see your point but just overall no but I don't think sensitive is that that's you can't say

[01:24:56.620 --> 01:25:00.660]
well think of current events maybe recently on the show concerning bits and things like that

[01:25:01.580 --> 01:25:05.400]
but I'm not gonna have any already made reference to that that wasn't our listening audience that

[01:25:05.400 --> 01:25:11.860]
was outside agitated right I'm being all encompassing as opposed to local no no no okay well whatever

[01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:17.580]
and addition was that was all foamed by a bunch of lily white right wing assholes too

[01:25:17.580 --> 01:25:24.060]
who are I don't stand that is black as you and I are well me anyway black 175 Cubans 132 Jews 50

[01:25:24.060 --> 01:25:28.100]
Jamaicans nine seeds they're moving up very slowly but surely they creep in on your

[01:25:28.100 --> 01:25:34.080]
mark those Jamaicans Catholics eight Chinese seven Haitians four red X2 it's amazing that Catholics

[01:25:34.080 --> 01:25:37.700]
only have eight because all this fear and history especially in the wake of that boss in our

[01:25:37.700 --> 01:25:42.700]
size these report about oh they're picking on the Catholics again and then we go that that one

[01:25:47.860 --> 01:25:51.900]

[01:25:51.900 --> 01:25:57.760]
story goes according to a lore that he shot and killed this guy because he thought the guy was

[01:25:57.760 --> 01:26:01.640]
Charlie Chaplin turned out it wasn't Charlie Chaplin it was this other director who's lore and

[01:26:01.640 --> 01:26:12.160]

[01:26:20.540 --> 01:26:26.840]
he who was making a play for his young wife William Randolph Hearst on his on his cruise on

[01:26:32.860 --> 01:26:33.460]
the cruise

yeah damn it here's a lady in four Lauderdale hello hello Neil yes man hi I often listen to you

[01:38:17.010 --> 01:38:24.890]
um about Toronto you know I lived in Toronto as a girl in the 53th house had some very good Canadian

[01:38:25.610 --> 01:38:30.570]
then I moved to New York because I resolved with a job and I had romantic interests and so on

[01:38:30.570 --> 01:38:37.810]
but you know that it's amazing this ethnic population change in our lifetime you know right

[01:38:37.810 --> 01:38:44.710]
when I lived there there wasn't a single Chinese or Chinese restaurant there wasn't a single black you

[01:38:44.710 --> 01:38:52.730]
know and the minority groups then were fins and serbs Eastern Europeans you know Dutch

[01:38:52.730 --> 01:38:59.950]
uh okay I you know it was a very very nice place but I think a lot of this change in population

[01:39:00.490 --> 01:39:06.790]
it's due to the fact a lot of these people come from what was formerly the British Empire you know

[01:39:06.790 --> 01:39:12.890]
Hong Kong Singapore and Jamaica I mean they've all made enormous changes and moved around

[01:39:12.890 --> 01:39:18.470]
just as my native country England now you know about me as large populations of

[01:39:18.470 --> 01:39:26.750]
your Macons and Pakistan is but I wanted to ask you just um Toronto still have a massive hall

[01:39:27.510 --> 01:39:33.590]
I have no idea because it used to have symphony concerts massive hall you know after the Canadian

[01:39:34.970 --> 01:39:41.510]
massacres but I do remember there was always a large Jewish population it's holy blah blah holy

[01:39:41.510 --> 01:39:50.550]
blossom temple you know I have no idea anyway regardless of Toronto I lived there as I say before

[01:39:50.550 --> 01:39:56.750]
they even thought of a subway do the I guess the cable cars don't run up and down young and

[01:39:56.750 --> 01:40:00.670]
basically there's still some cable cars around there's still a few of them just a really fancy

halondale hello yes sir hi how are you all right how are you great I wanted to talk to you I take

[01:44:44.290 --> 01:44:50.010]
issue with what you said about frank synatra yeah you say frank synatra sounded like he was talking

[01:44:50.010 --> 01:44:53.970]
when he was singing you couldn't sing for crap that's my thing the reason the reason that he

[01:44:53.970 --> 01:44:57.670]
sounded like he was talking when he was singing is because you understood every word he said

[01:44:57.670 --> 01:45:01.650]
not like other singers that when he is when he sings you can look to any other singer listen to

[01:45:01.650 --> 01:45:05.210]
a whole song at the end of the song you won't be sure of a few words they said with

[01:45:05.210 --> 01:45:09.570]
frank synatra sang you understood every word he said yeah I still think he couldn't sing for

[01:45:09.570 --> 01:45:14.750]
crap that's my opinion I did not and I mean what's that we can argue it till midnight I think he's

[01:45:14.750 --> 01:45:19.510]
stunk well it's not a question argument from the frank synatra's the greatest thing that ever lived

[01:45:19.510 --> 01:45:23.630]
when he sang you can understand every word he said you can understand you can understand every

[01:45:23.630 --> 01:45:27.710]
word that I'm saying right now too including goodbye that doesn't mean I'm a great singer does it

[01:45:27.710 --> 01:45:32.830]
no can you understand what I'm saying yeah I understand you as long as I slow down the old

[01:45:33.490 --> 01:45:39.970]
sounds like he called though I'm a reporter I'm sure glad he called yeah not another old fart

[01:45:39.970 --> 01:45:45.250]
a good another old New York fart you could understand it and he wouldn't respond to the fact that

[01:45:45.250 --> 01:45:50.370]
I said he couldn't sing that's not important you could just understand every word when victim

[01:45:50.370 --> 01:45:55.170]
victim on saying you can understand every word when l martino sings you can understand every word

[01:45:55.170 --> 01:46:00.390]
in fact I'd rather hear l martino sing you know you know when lute reads saying you also malved

[01:46:00.390 --> 01:46:07.490]
everything you could understand every word well l martino was in a godfather yeah I can even

[01:46:07.490 --> 01:46:13.410]
say I can slap I understand everything he just said it don't make him a great singer doesn't

[01:46:13.410 --> 01:46:18.070]
no oh he might have been in my opinion opera singer what the hell kind of crap is that see that's

[01:46:18.070 --> 01:46:23.190]
that old I mean the fossilized crap making excuses you could understand every so

[01:46:23.190 --> 01:46:28.030]
but you're just a brainwashed guy from another generation that's all pal it's sad brainwashed by

the mob and it's true a lot of the people that they put over in Vegas I'm not going to mention
