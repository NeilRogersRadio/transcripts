Chelsea Victoria Clinton arrived three weeks early on February 27th 1980 at 1124 pm

[00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:57.980]
while I was recovering bill would put his foot on my throat yank me by my hair and say woman don't spoil her

[00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:05.820]
I said okay Chelsea was sold by her opium addicted father when she was eight years old

[00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:12.800]
Chelsea looked at him and said bad things about her daddy that sealed the decision for bill

[00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:19.700]
I didn't know whether to laugh or cry but even more frightening at the age of 15

[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:27.700]
Chelsea had come back to haunt us she escaped and returned home only to be sold again to a

[00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:35.960]
whorehouse who would want to do that to kids who had never done anything to them me Hillary

[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:43.140]
Rodham Clinton Chelsea said come on mom don't do it oh yeah right I said

[00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:49.680]
looking like a dazed boxer who had just been pummeled in the ring she leaned toward me and whispered

[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:58.920]
in my ear you bitch those are great I bought that book it's 1145 at 560 WQ I'm here's one

[00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:04.560]
it says one day the time Valerie Bertinelli and then the mother never wore a bra it says what

[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:11.220]
body Franklin never wore a braziate but she was uh old and uh yeah pasty yeah I just

[00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:15.420]
think that's a good way to describe body Franklin she was really like pasty though we in fact maybe

[00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:20.040]
should work a couple of pasties you can probably see him anyway there you go one day the time there's

[00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:25.580]
another one for Eric I certainly hope that you and Eric are having a good relationship here so far

[00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:29.400]
you've got to need to mend your fences with Eric now that we no longer have our computer ace

[00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:36.400]
and believe me he ain't coming back okay right that down right it and granted on the wall he ain't

[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:45.800]
coming back no way no how is there any chance no no way ran out of lives on his show five callos

[00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:48.560]
oh yeah it's true

[00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:55.500]
haha it's an 80's that gave me no I bet you Miguel is very excited about the prospect

[00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:00.220]
of getting those wouldn't he's not in the room I don't know where he was he got nobody in there came

[00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:08.400]
back nobody I'll be damned we're uh rudderless five six seven oh five sixty well you know

[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:13.420]
it probably be a good idea if we just both dummyed up here for a minute or two whenever he's

[00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:17.960]
something if he came back in there we thought just silence just do it now now I can't do it okay I

[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.880]
don't have the heart to do that because he's getting married on Saturday he's got enough

[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:26.960]
brief coming up believe me well hi what work can he have possibly gone I mean like he just got

oh you had to go out and service Doreen during this last break yes here's a call from Boca hello good

[00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:57.880]
morning Neil how you doing today okay I got a suggestion for your poll and then a story that

[00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:03.280]
occurred on the Joe and Mark show last night okay my question is Lizzie McGuire there's a star

[00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:07.660]
of the star that shows Hillary Duff who's going to be the new Britney Spears but that's my suggestion

[00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:13.620]
okay last night on the mark and Joe show they had a guest dr. duty who gives you the

[00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:20.100]
Egolyn clean stuff so he gives him the stuff they both drink it down and it tastes terrible and they're

[00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:25.200]
saying how it's like fear factor with the horrible taste so then they're reading the ingredients on

[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:33.060]
it so it says the exactly stool softener milk of magnesia and then he goes sorbitol so it's

[00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:40.280]
that's interesting so I'm listening to the show sure enough about an hour later uh-huh he had a

[00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:51.540]
22 foot stool mark Eisenberg had a 22 foot stool yeah and I thought it'd be interested in the story

[00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:56.240]
how it was it was typical of their show I want to tell you a little of the since you mentioned that

[00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:00.640]
it goes to sure it must be on psychic wavelength yesterday I was out shopping at my a little

[00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:05.940]
supermarket nearby two blocks away and at the you know they always put these at the counter they

[00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:10.380]
put these uh what do they call those things to catch your eye uh impulse by impulse buying things

[00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:15.560]
so they had these all these little boxes of like hard candies and of course when you're fat you're

[00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:19.440]
always on a diet you're always trying to find something that's sweet but doesn't have any carbs you

[00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:25.680]
know and it said no sugar and it has no sorbitol but it had something called isomalt right

[00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:30.080]
and it were like about 20 of these raspberry a little around hard candies delicious great tasting

[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:33.940]
you know just something a suck on if I can say that and I brought them home and of course

[00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:38.080]
with them I'm sitting watching TV with an hour or two I have sucked on all 20 or 30 of these

[00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:43.520]
uh maybe was a good man these little candies I'm going to tell you something between five and seven

[00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:49.520]
p.m. last night I must have been the busiest man in the province of Ontario I can't even begin

[00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:53.840]
to describe it to you know it's so funny what you said about Joe and Mark show Joe has talent

[00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:59.200]
he's a funny guy I agree with you and but he he programs to the wrong age you program to the 18

[00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:06.380]
year olds I totally agree Mark Eisenberg on the other hand yeah the guy his it's hard to believe

[00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:14.680]
how first of all stubborn he is okay really he kneel he is the biggest piece of crap I've

[00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:21.780]
ever come across in my entire life number one one two one I didn't close yeah not even close I'm

[00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:27.660]
telling you you should listen to the show yeah he wants everybody in jail for the thought police to

[00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:34.680]
this police the guy is a Nazi and and even Joe who has the hold his tongue Mr. Diplomat he would

[00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:40.300]
stab him in the back fatally there be more blood in your studio believe me it would make Carlos

[00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:46.560]
look like a nosebleed like a piker okay like a piker you have a good day thank you too that was my

[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:51.860]
totally this was going to be great George you have so little faith man these have been this group has

[00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:56.500]
been one of the best bunches of calls because uh huh this is great today I'll give you a

[00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:59.740]
buzz grade well I'm not going to say it's ever going to happen again but you know you just keep

[00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:03.720]
doing it for a hundred years and sooner or later you hit the jackpot don't think that this was

[00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:10.000]
good you hit the pot with this 22 foot three how do you measure there's another guy that says

[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.920]
Mark Eisenberg is see the word that comes to mind I'm going to try to be diplomatic because he's not a

[00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:17.780]
bad I don't know why do I always say that I'm doing the same thing like that woman or whoever

[00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:22.280]
the caller was it said you know you're boring but you're not a bad guy how do I know if Mark

[00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:28.380]
Eisenberg's in ice guy I don't know I'm I've laid my eyes on his fat pudgy body a total maybe

[00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:33.040]
three minutes in a whole time that he's been on the station I don't see him I don't know from him

[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:38.900]
I'll say it he's in ice guy okay okay I'll agree with you he's in ice guy but the word that comes

[00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:47.180]
to mind is dored the L.A.R.D. dored okay okay which you can relate to that a little bit but I

[00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:52.100]
mean I mean by comparison you're like a whirling nervous you're like a Mexican jumping

[00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:57.580]
being in a heat compared to exactly just like that compared to to Mark Eisenberg he's boring

[00:11:57.580 --> 00:12:01.660]
usually it's terminal and didn't I say that way back in the beginning I was bemoaning the

[00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:05.720]
fire said a joke hostile why have you teamed up with this guy first of all what do you need

[00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:11.000]
another guy you're only on now for three hours anyway two to five in a morning right well you're

[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:20.920]
not going to get any calls you need something somebody that how was that what was that that well

[00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:27.160]
where did that come from shortcut oh my god that was mark Eisenberg even his laugh could put you

[00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:35.800]
into a coma that was that was that was shocking that was scandalous when I wait man I want you to

[00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:39.020]
play that get you know give your pause here I want you to play it again

[00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:44.540]
nice step down it one more time

[00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:51.140]
because I because I taped it right there I want to make sure I put it in my D I got a hand

[00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:56.960]
that my DCS no that's seriously no I know in fact just to be on the safe side I wanted

[00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:01.800]
one more please folks bear with me to do this on the air I want to make sure I got it extra

[00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:10.420]
special one more time there we go see there you go I got it that exciting we got Mark Eisenberg with

[00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:17.380]
a laugh of a dullard if it's small potatoes you know it's overnight but of course it's

[00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:21.240]
another good excuse mokin blame them like he already has in the past he sandwiched between

[00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:26.540]
cv4 he was sandwiched between two non sports shows now he's got his buddy for real on there who does

[00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:30.780]
do a sports show after a fashion in the clock so we can't blame him anymore so all he could say is

[00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:36.680]
he's failing so badly so desperately because he's following a non sports show meaning Joe and Mark

[00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:41.360]
okay now how can you blame an overnight show and the fact that you got like these

[00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:46.320]
minuscule horrendous numbers early in the morning and then you're so desperate that you have people

[00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:51.540]
calling can you imagine us ever doing that on our most desperate days and believe me we've had

[00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:56.020]
plenty of them yeah can you imagine inviting the audience to call in and suck our ass and then

[00:13:56.020 --> 00:14:01.300]
tell us how much they like us and how everybody else sucks I'd rather shoot myself hey well I'd rather

[00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:07.380]
shoot you too right I'd rather let you but I mean what what kind of kaka is that talk about

[00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:12.200]
desperation kaka although he did have a great line mode this morning we did the crossover with

[00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:16.520]
Scott at the eight o'clock he had a sensation line can you believe I had one color calling and

[00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:20.180]
tell me that I suck this morning I didn't hang up on him and you know something maybe he's got a

[00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:25.560]
point maybe I do suck and I thought to myself yeah now you're talking more now you're making some

[00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:29.020]
sense that's absolutely first honest thing he said in the whole time he's been on a radio station

[00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:35.200]
year and a half almost now does that he sucks am I getting all whipped up again that's good that

[00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:40.620]
place has don't say it's all good or hate when you say that I can't stand it rubber is the only one

[00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:52.780]

bigger thing first you get angry and then you say then you start laughing you start going with it okay

[00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:41.720]
if there are a bunch of morons out there and this is what america has become what you really has

[00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:45.580]

[00:34:57.540 --> 00:35:00.740]
they finished and then they had to draw the love was like they would do in the lottery to

[00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:05.560]

[00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:09.620]
put them in alphabetical order when that be all but no favoritism to the people that have

[00:35:09.620 --> 00:35:13.740]
blessed with an a in their name as opposed to you know the Arnold who has a you know an ass and

[00:35:13.740 --> 00:35:17.700]
so it has to be random because people are going to be drawn towards the top names and uh

[00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:22.360]
none and none and none i mean he speaks the language poorly he hasn't got a clue what it's all about

[00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:27.520]
he has his opinions are like uh all over the place just like a president oh you took the

[00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:30.720]
words right out of it just like the president so i'm thinking it's perfect because that's what

[00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:34.880]
america is becoming a nation of adults a nation of idiots except you know what more people like Arnold

[00:56:59.620 --> 00:57:04.740]
I'm telling you that that you put some of the beach on your foil the whole thing comes to purple.

Okay. Thanks.

[00:57:06.760 --> 00:57:08.340]
Do you ever see that show? No.

[00:57:09.360 --> 00:57:10.400]
Miguel? No.

[00:57:12.360 --> 00:57:16.120]

[00:57:28.960 --> 00:57:34.800]
No. That's a preview for it and didn't look at it. It looked like it's a Baywatch parrot proof.

[00:57:35.460 --> 00:57:39.740]
I'll tell you what show that I thought was good but wasn't on long enough to put on here because nobody saw it.

[00:57:40.280 --> 00:57:42.640]
Who's what was it called are you hot or who's hot.

[00:57:43.580 --> 00:57:50.780]
That's what all it was about. Are you hot? That was a show that was designed specifically to a rouse your groin man.

[00:57:50.880 --> 00:57:57.640]
It was it and then Lorenzo ripped off how you're going to start ripping Lorenzo Lomis again to and what was the show he was on Falcon Crash right?

[00:57:58.120 --> 00:58:03.280]
Well, why isn't that on there because nobody watched it. The hell they didn't wasn't that but your barber stand right on there.

[00:58:03.380 --> 00:58:08.900]
Exactly. Who was hot on that show Lorenzo Lomis and Tony Hunter too right.

[00:58:10.240 --> 00:58:18.480]
Now don't tell me that just because you have a bug up your ass about Lorenzo Lomis that when he was younger that you didn't I mean even in your macho Cuban mentality.

[00:58:19.500 --> 00:58:26.560]
I'd rather do a Lomis. No, okay. See there you go Lorenzo Lomis may have been one of the 10 best looking men it was ever born.

[00:58:26.860 --> 00:58:32.080]

[00:58:39.540 --> 00:58:43.260]
Yeah, because he's about 75 years old trying to act like he's 30 Miguel is better looking.

[00:58:44.220 --> 00:58:50.920]
Of course right now right now I'll go along with that. Of course I don't I can't see what he looks like from here here.

[00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:59.300]
I'll hold him up to you. Oh, I don't look too good. 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on a AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line.

[00:58:59.300 --> 00:59:02.140]
Especially after he rolled around on that Smith that was on the floor Thursday.

[00:59:02.800 --> 00:59:07.340]
Yeah, it wasn't anywhere near it. It was me and Scott getting all splattered with bloody mucus. Really? Yeah.

[00:59:07.960 --> 00:59:15.440]
Well in for all case how could you tell him? Yeah, he's kind of a crusty guy.

[00:59:16.040 --> 00:59:20.200]
Fine and I'm not going to dinner with you when I come back Scott. Sorry about that. Now see he's going to take it personal.

[00:59:20.760 --> 00:59:24.940]
And I he's one of those people that if you tell him something he's he's talking he just keeps talking.

[00:59:25.460 --> 00:59:29.820]
So if you tell him I'm not going to I'm not doing dinners. Okay, because I'm on perpetual diet.

[00:59:30.180 --> 00:59:35.260]
I'm desperate to lose some weight. If I would lose that extra 20 or 30 pounds. I've been screaming about for 30 years now.

[00:59:35.360 --> 00:59:42.560]
I wouldn't have heels spurs and all these other things. You know. I just want your when you're fat.

[00:59:43.580 --> 00:59:48.920]
It puts all this extra pressure on your joints. You know. Yeah, I heard that.

[00:59:48.920 --> 00:59:54.640]
And there's nothing wrong with having a little pressure on your joint, but a little bit too much may not be a good thing.

[00:59:56.260 --> 01:00:00.780]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the ATAT line. Here's Miami. Hello.

[01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:12.420]
Yeah, sir. Here's a good one for your gay audience. It's the best show that they rerun sometimes. You can still catch it with the original Wild Wild West.

[01:00:16.340 --> 01:00:24.920]
With either we remember the guy's name. The lead actor Adam James West. I'm not good with name, but I'm good with body.

[01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:32.020]
Was it Robert Conrad? George says that guy. Was it Robert Conrad? That was him. Okay.

[01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:39.340]
Got it down, man. Thanks. Wild Wild West. I'm looking at any votes. Robert Conrad was he was good looking guy. I guess. Yeah.

[01:00:39.340 --> 01:00:44.300]
Yeah. Rugged. Yeah. A little bit too rugged for me. A little too macho for me. Not hard enough.

[01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:52.060]
5 and he went pretty. 5 6 7 0 5. It's not like John Schneider who was real pretty on a very pretty at a pretty silly show. He was pretty.

[01:00:53.240 --> 01:01:00.960]
I'm not giving up on you know. Just it's a hopeless case. No, when you got these cuban. I'm sitting here with two cuban.

[01:01:01.140 --> 01:01:06.580]
Is that a real. I mean, I'm either one of his ever going to admit that any guy ever looked good or was pretty right in like that.

[01:01:06.580 --> 01:01:11.180]
Well, that's good looking guy. I know what a good looking guy looks like. Well, that's good. You know, you're desperate these days.

[01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:21.240]
Yeah. Never watched the show for this reason. 68 people. 16.9% of this audience lie through their teeth. Charlie's Angels 47. They watched 39.

[01:01:21.460 --> 01:01:27.680]
Wonder Woman 35, which I just saw this morning on the action channel. You don't get that either. Yeah. Look at that.

[01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:33.580]
Look at that. Too bad you missed it. Where are they offered? I'd like to give them my thanks.

[01:01:33.580 --> 01:01:39.560]
They departed through the windows. In some case, you do feel. Yeah. They asked me to give you a message.

[01:01:39.780 --> 01:01:44.380]
Boy, should you ever again come up against such a criminal as the penguin? There's the penguin.

[01:01:44.460 --> 01:01:50.300]
Don't you ever get captured in your self. I just heard a call. The police. The job of crime fighting is that.

[01:01:50.300 --> 01:01:56.540]
It is Bruce Wayne with his buddy, Dick. 5 6 7 0 5 60 is budding.

[01:01:57.020 --> 01:02:05.660]
Is budding. Buddy. Dick. Where was I? No list here before I got sidetracked small.

[01:02:06.440 --> 01:02:10.620]
Duke's as of 27 dream. A G. 26 real world. 22 smallville 14.

[01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:18.980]
On happily ever after 13, charm 12, partridge family is stuck on 10. Dallas 9, flipper 9.

[01:02:19.880 --> 01:02:23.680]
Oh, that's what the question I was asking before before I interrupted myself on flipper.

[01:02:24.300 --> 01:02:32.460]
It was like Luke Alpin and a brother bud. And then it was Ranger Ricks. Now maybe Ranger Ricks looked a little rugged kind of like Robert Conrad.

[01:02:32.460 --> 01:02:36.180]
And we're just talking about right. Barely chest. Ranger Ricks.

[01:02:36.180 --> 01:02:45.480]
A big, barely chest. You know, like a big old barrel. You remember that? His chest was huge. He was like broad.

[01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:55.560]
His chest was like a broad. Well, like a flat broad with hair. This is George by the way. He's talking about.

[01:02:55.680 --> 01:03:02.000]
He had the hearts for Ranger Ricks when he was a kid. Yeah. Martin flipper. Flippin it. I'll never forget that call.

[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:06.900]
I made on Zeta the Luke Alpin. And it was one of the highlights of my mediocre career. That was so so exciting.

[01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:13.800]
Welcome up early in the morning. And he was pretty good. And he's a born again Christian Luke Alpin lives in Fort Lauderdale, which is where they taped most of those shows.

[01:03:14.340 --> 01:03:20.980]
Was it C. World was at it? The aquarium, Miami, C. Query, I see. Well, whatever. He lives in Fort Lauderdale. And he's a good guy.

[01:03:21.500 --> 01:03:25.900]
And spread that born again. By the way, let me just make a suggestion. All the people in the audience out there.

[01:03:26.860 --> 01:03:31.840]
This is very important. You really ought to write this down. Put it in fact like in Memento, write it down on your wrist.

[01:03:32.820 --> 01:03:38.720]
And on other body parts. Okay. And that is that anybody who is a religion, anybody believes that the religion stuff needs to be.

[01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:46.580]
We need to get a butterfly net. I'm not just talking about people who participate because it's like tradition or just a thing to do, you know, like a social club.

[01:03:46.900 --> 01:03:50.600]
But people are really are the religionist. If we could just run them all up what a great place this would be.

[01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:56.740]
Why in local? We're sports radio five sixty. She went to a.m.

[01:03:58.320 --> 01:04:01.020]
Oh boy. It's the one to two hour.

[01:04:02.180 --> 01:04:05.720]
Ladies and gentlemen, the brothers who came.

[01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:14.460]
One, two, three, four, five. Well, once in a row. We know they're not alive because we found my hiding spot in back bed.

[01:04:14.460 --> 01:04:20.200]
And now that they're dead, I don't feel it in a bit sand. They're the things that were so damn sick.

[01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:25.880]
Loads and dumb sons were roasted on the stick. They were vapors. Murderous. Bloodlooms and crows.

[01:04:26.180 --> 01:04:33.820]
And now they're just a memory and I rackety history books. In the end they went out like jerks. I wonder if they finally lost those evil cockies.

[01:04:33.820 --> 01:04:38.800]
They were spurps. Watchin' TV while our hell broke loose. And a mom hit that cup loose.

[01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:49.480]
Big old ugly youth. They finally died. We're little brother who saved by his side. I wonder if the daddy even tried to save his son's or one seat terrified.

[01:04:50.260 --> 01:05:00.800]
We finally closed the book and back to song. They were full of hate and stole from song. Now they're on the hell bound seven trains. Say goodbye to the brother to save.

[01:05:17.660 --> 01:05:30.780]
I know you're gonna think I'm crazy but I'm telling you I hear something I'm sad. Hey, that's just a TV. Don't be so paranoid.

[01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:58.680]
They're not gonna be so paranoid. They're not gonna be so paranoid. They're not gonna be so paranoid.

[01:05:58.680 --> 01:06:00.760]
They're not gonna be so paranoid. They're not gonna be so paranoid. They're not gonna be so paranoid. They're not gonna be so paranoid.

[01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:11.540]
From Elizabeth Taylor, the woman who first brought you the fragrance white diamonds. I'm back with the sensual remember for hours.

[01:06:11.840 --> 01:06:22.500]
Elizabeth Taylor presents white castle. The essence of meat and onions and pickles. It's a sack of sent you'll never forget. Elizabeth Taylor's white castle.

[01:06:22.500 --> 01:06:33.840]
All my men love white castle under the sheets. A fragrance that lingers on and on and on. Maybe longer than you'd like. Elizabeth Taylor's white castle.

[01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:43.820]
Live white castle. Love white castle. Eat white castle. Wear white castle from Elizabeth Taylor in six ounce bottles or buy the sack.

[01:06:43.820 --> 01:07:04.280]
Are you suffering from a wreckle dysfunction? Real man's just not what it used to be. Really? Oh man. What up, pussy? I don't win. You gotta be kidding. You mean to tell me you're just hanging a droopy prune? Wow. You're a sissy. You're not even gay. You're beyond gay, dude.

[01:07:04.280 --> 01:07:14.200]
Would he have someone lift his spoon of corn flakes for you in the morning? Let's face it. If you really need this stuff, you're not a man at all. I mean how many men actually need this garbage?

[01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:31.180]
Three? Anybody who buys peanuts and hamsters just wants to get bigger and stay that way overnight. That's all. There's no real medical use for it. Unless you're a swishy-whose. What do you offended? Hey, we're a pharmaceutical company. We can do any goddamn thing we want now.

[01:07:31.180 --> 01:07:44.860]
Any sh** we got on his shelf will make you think you need it. And guess what? You're so f**king stupid. I can say all this and you'll still run to your doctor for a script. Oh man, what a loser. Probably Republican.

[01:08:34.340 --> 01:08:52.400]
Everyone can be placed for a day. This is gonna be famous. Don't gotta be famous. The money is so pro-plan. The 3500 is something to stop them.

[01:08:53.740 --> 01:09:01.820]
You on Fox right after 101 things removed from the human body. It's 101 things removed from Richard Simmons.

[01:09:02.200 --> 01:09:13.920]
I want to get started right away. Zagnus. Squicky toy. SpongeBob SquarePants. Rolex. Hold it. This is big.

[01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:22.600]
One hundred one things removed from Richard Simmons' butt. On Fox. What do you get?

[01:09:52.600 --> 01:10:02.420]
Sack a bull around the world in a frostbassy. You can look 10th on Chevy trucks that get the tough jobs done even if they have to float.

[01:10:02.780 --> 01:10:03.600]
Sack a bull.

[01:10:15.520 --> 01:10:28.660]
I'm about to double the station. That's the station. Oh, there's a lovely Queen still. This looks like a full spot. My every beach at last.

[01:10:30.060 --> 01:10:43.420]
He was sitting be meeting me. All right, nothing like taking a dip in some manhole. I'll just just just a cup of tea. My balls could use a little vitamin C.

[01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:48.520]
Hey, what kind of body. Oh, that looks like a. Her.

[01:10:50.020 --> 01:10:51.140]
I'm not.

[01:10:53.940 --> 01:11:05.380]
I know. But listen, you know, he want to help me. You think you think that got a knowledge under his tutelage. Well, actually I was gonna ask you.

[01:11:35.380 --> 01:11:37.500]
What? I need a school.

[01:11:53.080 --> 01:11:59.300]
You know when you feel the weight of sadness, you feel lonely and don't enjoy the things you once loved.

[01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:01.300]
Hey, Rex, how's it going, boy?

[01:12:02.300 --> 01:12:11.400]
Oh, my. I don't enjoy you anymore. These are some symptoms of depression. It's off to your doctor about solar. The number one prescribed brand of its kind.

[01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:16.420]
Hi, Rex. I'm on solar. Now, so I'm better. How's it going, boy?

[01:12:17.060 --> 01:12:22.540]
Oh, my leg. Hey, but that's okay. I've got two of them.

[01:12:22.540 --> 01:12:28.240]
Oh, give my ankle back. You a trick star. So locked is not for having.

[01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:34.000]
Oh, the best blood all over the carpet. I was gonna get a new one anyway. So locked.

[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:34.320]
I'm not.

[01:12:41.140 --> 01:12:42.980]
I'm not.

[01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:53.800]
Show the dark wrinkles on my face. It shots of both dots can raise.

[01:12:58.560 --> 01:13:07.480]
For every A they kind of annoy and don't like him injecting the dead in boys on your hand.

[01:13:10.780 --> 01:13:17.560]
He only adults of this treatment wanted to tell me more would put the six feet under.

[01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:18.100]
Yeah.

[01:13:23.580 --> 01:13:27.600]
It makes up my crossbeats.

[01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:28.920]
And I think so.

[01:13:29.460 --> 01:13:30.960]
Little different.

[01:13:31.940 --> 01:13:33.800]
The other stuff.

[01:13:35.460 --> 01:13:39.280]
One of the same best things by far.

[01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:41.600]
I'm only risk and parallel in it.

[01:13:41.700 --> 01:13:45.740]
So you can take your coat on stock and find yourself another.

[01:13:46.420 --> 01:13:48.160]
So go around there.

[01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:52.660]
One 11 and at five sixty WQM we had mad dog coming up and two.

[01:13:52.780 --> 01:13:55.200]
Do you see who's on a schedule for tomorrow two to four?

[01:13:57.200 --> 01:13:58.440]
Yes. Little dog.

[01:13:59.140 --> 01:14:02.400]
Yes. Joe Rose is going to be out of my just I just mentioned that.

[01:14:05.120 --> 01:14:09.260]
Yeah. I just want to make sure that you promote the hell out of this show.

[01:14:09.260 --> 01:14:09.760]
I know why you're on.

[01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:10.460]
I'm feeling good.

[01:14:12.220 --> 01:14:14.080]
He's our new hero Joe Rose.

[01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:15.540]
Antimo.

[01:14:16.340 --> 01:14:17.460]
Oh, speaking of Willie Ames.

[01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:20.660]
Yeah, I had seen something about this or maybe we read it.

[01:14:20.660 --> 01:14:26.180]
We were talking about it once before he created producers and stars in Bible man.

[01:14:26.300 --> 01:14:27.620]
A Christian video series for children.

[01:14:27.740 --> 01:14:29.540]
He became a religious nut, but it's canceled.

[01:14:30.380 --> 01:14:31.000]
Oh, good.

[01:14:32.500 --> 01:14:33.960]
The aims is this is a second wife.

[01:14:33.960 --> 01:14:37.840]
I've been married for ten years after the cancellation of eight is enough in 81.

[01:14:38.340 --> 01:14:40.340]
Willie turned to rock music and cocaine.

[01:14:41.340 --> 01:14:45.260]
It was only after he read wire John Belushi's biography that he realized that if he didn't

[01:14:45.260 --> 01:14:46.580]
shape up he might end up dead.

[01:14:47.180 --> 01:14:48.460]
At the time he met a second wife.

[01:14:48.700 --> 01:14:49.960]
He had been clean for six months.

[01:14:50.340 --> 01:14:57.120]
Bible man is a superhero who defeats villains such as Dr. Decepto and Madame Glitz with prayer and the sword of truth.

[01:14:57.320 --> 01:14:57.860]
Antimo, I will.

[01:14:58.600 --> 01:14:59.940]
Amen to my direction man.

[01:15:02.380 --> 01:15:04.360]
Who's in front of your Charlie's Angels with fifty?

[01:15:04.520 --> 01:15:06.100]
I mean, to think about I never watch them.

[01:15:06.600 --> 01:15:08.420]
Why even waste our time with that right?

[01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:10.960]
No, those are sincere sanctimonious people.

[01:15:11.260 --> 01:15:11.440]
Not.

[01:15:12.100 --> 01:15:13.920]
Never watch this show for that reason 71.

[01:15:14.280 --> 01:15:15.260]
Charlie's Angels 50.

[01:15:15.660 --> 01:15:16.540]
Baywatch 40.

[01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:18.140]
Wonder Woman 35.

[01:15:18.660 --> 01:15:19.780]
Duke's a hazard 28.

[01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:21.320]
Dream Agini 27.

[01:15:21.900 --> 01:15:24.040]
Real Rural 24 after that kind of small potatoes.

[01:15:24.760 --> 01:15:27.940]
Speaking of potatoes, if you can't eat it because you're on a low carb diet.

[01:15:28.060 --> 01:15:34.740]
If you're on the Atkins or any other low carb sugar-free diet, then here's a story that you're going to love shopping in because it's entirely dedicated to you.

[01:15:34.740 --> 01:15:36.080]
Do you like the West Bokeh?

[01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:41.160]
Number one low carb store in the entire universe with over 900 low carb sugar-free products and stocking.

[01:15:41.260 --> 01:15:44.280]
You can be sure that lots of stacks and all kinds of good things are waiting for you on the shelves.

[01:15:44.460 --> 01:15:47.860]
Unlike your supermarket where it's almost impossible to find these things.

[01:15:48.220 --> 01:15:48.920]
Do you like the West Bokeh?

[01:15:49.060 --> 01:15:51.400]
Is introducing new stuff every month and this month there's no exception.

[01:15:51.620 --> 01:15:52.880]
So what's said on the 10th of June?

[01:15:53.220 --> 01:15:54.160]
Who's account is this now?

[01:15:54.220 --> 01:15:55.000]
By the way, is this Skippy?

[01:15:55.640 --> 01:15:56.040]
I don't know.

[01:15:56.400 --> 01:15:57.280]
Hey, Skippy, you suck.

[01:15:57.440 --> 01:15:58.560]

Uday! Uday! I'm a breakfast!

[01:21:41.780 --> 01:21:45.700]
Ever since those two boys of my work killed, they're always late!

[01:21:46.620 --> 01:21:47.520]
Did it wait?

[01:21:50.440 --> 01:21:52.120]
Good morning, Uncle George!

[01:21:53.580 --> 01:21:54.620]

As usual, those two dead sons of mine are nowhere to be found!

[01:22:02.560 --> 01:22:03.940]
I think I know where they are Saddam.

[01:22:04.360 --> 01:22:06.160]
I'll bet they're right out there on the front lawn.

[01:22:06.680 --> 01:22:08.280]
Watch your open the door and find out.

[01:22:08.500 --> 01:22:12.060]
Oh, I don't like to do that, but OK, Uncle George!

[01:22:13.040 --> 01:22:14.280]

Hiding in Afghanistan!

[01:23:23.020 --> 01:23:23.620]

[01:23:32.240 --> 01:23:34.000]

This is the day, your summer!

[01:23:41.400 --> 01:23:43.360]
This is the day, your summer!

[01:23:47.200 --> 01:23:50.020]
You know, sweetheart, these times we live and have me frighten.

[01:23:50.340 --> 01:23:53.060]
I wish there was a place to go where we could feel safe.

[01:23:53.400 --> 01:23:55.640]
Honey, this might just be the time to move to a bump!

[01:23:56.020 --> 01:23:56.080]
Bump!

[01:23:56.080 --> 01:23:56.280]
Bump!

[01:23:56.840 --> 01:23:58.140]
I thought it was an Egypt!

[01:23:58.460 --> 01:24:00.720]
Right, there's a bump right here in America, dear!

[01:24:00.920 --> 01:24:01.960]
You know, East Bump!

[01:24:02.520 --> 01:24:04.580]
And let me tell you, there was nothing in Bump!

[01:24:04.820 --> 01:24:06.460]
That any terrorist would want to attack!

[01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:07.740]
But what about bump!

[01:24:08.080 --> 01:24:10.360]
Boss, is it expensive to live in Bump?

[01:24:10.740 --> 01:24:11.760]
Bump is cheap!

[01:24:11.760 --> 01:24:13.980]
But we have to act fast if we want to live in Bump!

[01:24:14.300 --> 01:24:16.280]
Because everyone's going to want to move to Bump!

[01:24:16.480 --> 01:24:17.460]
Very, very soon!

[01:24:17.700 --> 01:24:18.560]
But won't bump!

[01:24:18.820 --> 01:24:21.260]
Become a target once everyone moves to Bump!

[01:24:21.640 --> 01:24:24.100]
Oh, get- we'll cross that reddewary come to it!

[01:24:24.180 --> 01:24:25.780]

[01:24:26.580 --> 01:24:26.900]
Bump!

[01:24:27.460 --> 01:24:31.740]
Because the safest place to be right now is out in the middle of...

[01:24:31.740 --> 01:24:32.080]
Bump!

[01:24:32.700 --> 01:24:36.600]
What if Bill Clinton did indeed get his own TV talk show?

[01:24:37.460 --> 01:24:38.760]

[01:25:37.320 --> 01:25:38.300]
Everybody, right here!

[01:25:40.240 --> 01:25:41.240]
So, Yasser?

[01:25:41.580 --> 01:25:42.000]
Yes, sir?

[01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:44.680]
Is there any way we can solve this whole thing?

[01:25:45.080 --> 01:25:46.100]
I don't think so, sir.

[01:25:46.320 --> 01:25:48.420]
Let's say I send you over a couple of queens of King.

[01:25:48.900 --> 01:25:50.420]
What do you mean I do not understand?

[01:25:50.660 --> 01:25:51.540]
Sure you do, buddy!

[01:25:51.960 --> 01:25:53.100]
I'm talking about Flusis,

[01:25:53.420 --> 01:25:55.140]
Huchis, Zipper Monkeys!

[01:25:55.960 --> 01:25:56.400]
Well...

[01:25:56.400 --> 01:25:58.200]
Loosen your tablecloth and think about it.

[01:25:58.260 --> 01:25:59.140]
Meantime Scoot over!

[01:25:59.220 --> 01:26:00.280]
My next guest is here!

[01:26:00.280 --> 01:26:01.900]
Al, thanks Bill!

[01:26:02.500 --> 01:26:05.180]
Our next guest is the former political machine.

[01:26:05.620 --> 01:26:07.240]
He's got snow on the roof,

[01:26:07.600 --> 01:26:08.760]
a fire in the furnace,

[01:26:09.180 --> 01:26:10.640]
and a bug up his butt.

[01:26:11.680 --> 01:26:12.560]
Please welcome...

[01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:13.660]
Newton Gengrich!

[01:26:14.560 --> 01:26:15.340]
Alright, mate!

[01:26:16.140 --> 01:26:17.020]
Welcome there, buddy!

[01:26:17.140 --> 01:26:18.360]
How's things by you, Newty?

[01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:21.320]
Well, my new wife's got a colesome leave, and her.

[01:26:21.480 --> 01:26:23.480]
Good for you, you soulless bastard!

[01:26:23.920 --> 01:26:25.160]
We'll be right back with care and tops!

[01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:25.860]
Stay with me!

[01:26:26.580 --> 01:26:27.820]
126 at 5.16.

[01:26:28.040 --> 01:26:30.260]
Here's the fact that it's as anybody's heard in the WLRR

[01:26:30.260 --> 01:26:32.280]
and WPBT have been running and rerunning

[01:26:32.280 --> 01:26:34.760]
Silia Cruz concert specials for the last few weeks

[01:26:34.760 --> 01:26:37.420]
is really getting ponderous as a daring and dense.

[01:26:37.840 --> 01:26:39.760]
Her influence in the world of transvestism

[01:26:39.760 --> 01:26:40.760]
cannot be overstated,

[01:26:41.080 --> 01:26:42.260]
especially here in South Florida,

[01:26:42.420 --> 01:26:43.260]
near the airy illusionist,

[01:26:43.900 --> 01:26:45.340]
which is the PC term from Adora,

[01:26:45.740 --> 01:26:47.020]
to define the cocks' base.

[01:26:47.140 --> 01:26:48.260]
Is there her look on Silia?

[01:26:49.360 --> 01:26:50.120]
Who are these people?

[01:26:51.220 --> 01:26:51.380]
Huh?

[01:26:52.560 --> 01:26:53.380]
And also it says,

[01:26:53.560 --> 01:26:55.640]
what does SN agree to Kay Va Kamenando?

[01:26:56.480 --> 01:26:57.860]
Is that a girl that's coming?

[01:26:57.860 --> 01:26:58.300]
No!

[01:26:58.500 --> 01:27:00.460]
Mean, is it something about a black woman?

[01:27:00.880 --> 01:27:01.080]
Yes.

[01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:04.300]
And that black woman that goes walking?

[01:27:04.800 --> 01:27:06.100]
Is that a girl that's coming?

[01:27:06.620 --> 01:27:08.240]
That little black woman that goes walking?

[01:27:09.380 --> 01:27:10.180]
On Aglita?

[01:27:10.540 --> 01:27:10.720]
Yes.

[01:27:11.340 --> 01:27:11.800]
I see.

[01:27:12.960 --> 01:27:14.100]

My high school student.

[01:28:24.100 --> 01:28:26.680]
I love this. This is Fort Real 560.

[01:28:27.420 --> 01:28:29.020]
Way to A.M.

[01:28:30.860 --> 01:28:34.440]
Remember this golden gasser.

[01:28:40.120 --> 01:28:42.240]
Wonderful WQAM.

[01:28:43.520 --> 01:28:47.840]
Bye bye to my piece of the pie.

[01:29:03.760 --> 01:29:17.820]
I'm going to get a little bit of a

[01:30:47.820 --> 01:30:50.700]
good news is that cheap blue herself away.

[01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.480]
Cause everybody knows that it's LA.

[01:30:53.920 --> 01:30:56.840]
They let murderers walk every day.

[01:30:57.960 --> 01:30:58.400]
Yes.

[01:30:59.600 --> 01:31:03.680]
Another last of her side thanks to your psychopic wife

[01:31:03.680 --> 01:31:06.580]
who had a stupid face like Brin.

[01:31:07.380 --> 01:31:13.720]
A news radio was a main show except that you were there.

[01:31:15.280 --> 01:31:19.720]
And some characters from the simpsons and laws.

[01:31:20.760 --> 01:31:21.380]
Their laws.

[01:31:22.060 --> 01:31:25.400]
It's not all that fits your life would have lasted long.

[01:31:26.040 --> 01:31:29.080]
But she left you no choice.

[01:31:31.580 --> 01:31:34.120]
Good by joy, big claw.

[01:31:34.700 --> 01:31:36.220]
That you made a front such.

[01:31:36.760 --> 01:31:41.120]
Films as I buried an expert a rumble of hands a gun.

[01:31:41.120 --> 01:31:44.680]
And honey I just blew your head off.

[01:31:45.640 --> 01:31:48.780]
Now Lionel Huts can't get rid off.

[01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:51.640]
She's dead anyway.

[01:31:53.120 --> 01:31:55.520]
Saturday night has fallen further.

[01:31:56.040 --> 01:32:00.620]
In the case instead the reason you let any way.

[01:32:02.900 --> 01:32:04.980]
And the substance you die.

[01:32:05.200 --> 01:32:07.020]
Cause of your psychotic wife.

[01:32:07.020 --> 01:32:09.980]
With that stupid name like Brin.

[01:32:10.900 --> 01:32:17.240]
And the simpsons will never be the same again.

[01:32:19.200 --> 01:32:23.580]
And assholes like your hesitant preacher box.

[01:32:24.060 --> 01:32:24.620]
So right.

[01:32:25.220 --> 01:32:26.620]
It's a good thing she said.

[01:32:26.940 --> 01:32:32.040]
Cause now they can't defend that bitch you had for a while.

[01:32:42.660 --> 01:32:44.720]
And she's dead anyway.

[01:32:44.960 --> 01:32:48.380]
And she's dead anyway.

[01:32:48.380 --> 01:32:49.140]
And she's dead anyway.

[01:32:49.140 --> 01:32:49.200]
And she's dead anyway.

[01:32:49.200 --> 01:32:50.480]
And she's dead anyway.

[01:32:51.160 --> 01:32:52.800]
And she's dead anyway.

[01:32:53.100 --> 01:33:05.180]
And she's dead anyway.

[01:33:05.180 --> 01:33:06.520]
Where is it?

[01:33:06.780 --> 01:33:08.540]
So if you think you're part of.

[01:33:08.800 --> 01:33:10.480]
There's people that you will stuff.

[01:33:10.800 --> 01:33:14.900]
You won't find things that are rough in the guidey family.

[01:33:22.300 --> 01:33:24.880]
Grandma's Cape got blown up by a missile.

[01:33:25.320 --> 01:33:28.860]
And falling from the sky over Kabul.

[01:33:30.860 --> 01:33:33.380]
Laying in her sack she heard the whistle.

[01:33:34.380 --> 01:33:37.380]
And I'm done to the back of her pet meows.

[01:33:38.260 --> 01:33:39.180]
She's a real girl.

[01:33:39.600 --> 01:33:42.180]
Slowly rolling through the desert.

[01:33:42.580 --> 01:33:43.920]
And I'm on the Arlesia.

[01:33:44.320 --> 01:33:46.280]
Naked from her head to toe.

[01:33:46.960 --> 01:33:48.260]
And her swipe only.

[01:33:48.500 --> 01:33:50.100]
Somehow she had a skip.

[01:33:50.300 --> 01:33:50.860]
I heard.

[01:33:51.280 --> 01:33:52.620]
And I'm on for Grandma.

[01:33:52.620 --> 01:33:54.740]
And Latin had no more clothes.

[01:33:55.820 --> 01:33:56.940]
And I'm done to the first time.

[01:33:57.020 --> 01:33:59.420]
Roll that meow like she was a man.

[01:33:59.860 --> 01:34:00.360]
I'm mad.

[01:34:00.620 --> 01:34:01.120]
I'm mad.

[01:34:01.120 --> 01:34:03.500]
As the sand tells in her face.

[01:34:05.160 --> 01:34:07.720]
And squirted by the Taliban.

[01:34:08.380 --> 01:34:11.800]
The sea old woman headed for Osama's place.

[01:34:12.080 --> 01:34:16.180]
That's because Grandma's Cape got blown up by a missile.

[01:34:17.600 --> 01:34:20.060]
And falling from the sky over Kabul.

[01:34:22.080 --> 01:34:24.560]
Laying in her sack she heard the whistle.

[01:34:25.600 --> 01:34:29.020]
And I'm done to the back of her pet meows.

[01:34:29.020 --> 01:34:29.980]
And I'm on for Grandma's Cape.

[01:34:29.980 --> 01:34:32.180]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

[01:34:33.780 --> 01:34:39.500]
I'm done to the back of her pet meows.

[01:34:39.500 --> 01:34:43.340]
In a place that fell just like the bad day at the zoo.

[01:34:44.320 --> 01:34:46.420]
If she's got back dressed in dress,

[01:34:46.680 --> 01:34:48.440]
I dream every week she would.

[01:34:49.140 --> 01:34:52.180]
If she wanted to bring us up for that land.

[01:34:53.620 --> 01:34:57.960]
It seems like you gotta do it just like CNN

[01:34:59.480 --> 01:35:02.800]
Why is this as usual sound like the Palabite night?

[01:35:04.060 --> 01:35:08.000]
Hey, girls, but don't wear packs that's a Palabite night

[01:35:08.640 --> 01:35:11.080]
Tell about that, and we'll take you back

[01:35:11.080 --> 01:35:13.880]
Run as well, we'll go back to bed with time

[01:35:14.720 --> 01:35:17.460]
I want to dance, we'll go forward

[01:35:17.460 --> 01:35:20.460]
Let's make commands that are performing

[01:35:20.460 --> 01:35:23.720]
Is friends might get like, directions of my neighborhoods

[01:35:23.720 --> 01:35:25.040]
When I called Paul talented

[01:35:25.040 --> 01:35:28.880]
His cute killing was delivered by 9

[01:35:29.460 --> 01:35:33.360]
And as a bright example he send it to the cameraman

[01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:38.500]
And use a bump all the time we met in the gunna sound

[01:35:38.500 --> 01:35:42.800]
And dance like the Palabite tonight

[01:35:42.800 --> 01:35:44.060]
enta precedes crossbright

[01:35:46.200 --> 01:35:50.680]
One of the great lines in the history of the human race smells like a bad day at the zoo.

[01:35:50.820 --> 01:35:52.920]
21-2, don't you love that?

[01:35:53.160 --> 01:35:54.000]
That's one of my favorites.

[01:35:54.160 --> 01:35:56.740]
Only the sick Bokobrank can come up with something like that folks.

[01:35:56.920 --> 01:36:02.480]
Okay, how's that pool coming over the years which TV show have you watched most because you thought a regular on the show was hot?

[01:36:03.520 --> 01:36:05.200]
I never watched the show for that reason.

[01:36:05.540 --> 01:36:05.960]
74.

[01:36:06.360 --> 01:36:06.660]
Uh-huh.

[01:36:07.040 --> 01:36:09.120]
Okay, 75 now. Just changed again.

[01:36:09.460 --> 01:36:10.580]
Just to prove their point.

[01:36:11.360 --> 01:36:12.480]
Charlie's Angels 52.

[01:36:13.080 --> 01:36:17.560]
Oh, you know, when I left off my three sons that played before that gradey, but forget about it.

[01:36:17.780 --> 01:36:18.280]
That's just for you.

[01:36:18.740 --> 01:36:19.040]
I know.

[01:36:19.400 --> 01:36:19.680]
It was.

[01:36:20.340 --> 01:36:23.200]
Charlie's Angels 52, Baywatch 42, Wonder Woman 38.

[01:36:23.700 --> 01:36:24.740]
Dukes of Hanzo 31.

[01:36:25.500 --> 01:36:28.360]
Maybe somebody thought Fred McMurray was hot, but I doubt it.

[01:36:28.480 --> 01:36:29.560]
I think they made it 39.

[01:36:30.180 --> 01:36:30.300]
What?

[01:36:30.840 --> 01:36:31.920]
And Fred Merch.

[01:36:32.520 --> 01:36:39.800]
The real world 24, smallville 16, unhappy ever after 15, charmed 14, flipper 13, clip it, Luke.

[01:36:40.600 --> 01:36:42.380]
Partridge family 10, Dallas 10.

[01:36:42.480 --> 01:36:43.740]
Everybody else is in single digits.

[01:36:43.940 --> 01:36:45.220]
Although, this even choir went on her late.

[01:36:45.520 --> 01:36:46.040]
It's got eight.

[01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:47.740]
And it's great.

[01:36:48.700 --> 01:36:49.320]
20 till two.

[01:36:49.380 --> 01:36:50.580]
We got the mad dog who's great.

[01:36:50.600 --> 01:36:51.340]
He's coming up at two.

[01:36:51.400 --> 01:36:52.840]
The Humper from Ashulah's at four.

[01:36:52.960 --> 01:36:54.360]
Go watch him eat Marlins game tonight.

[01:36:54.520 --> 01:36:55.100]
Any K at 10.

[01:36:55.400 --> 01:36:56.260]
Joe and Mark overnight.

[01:36:56.520 --> 01:36:57.260]
They're working on it.

[01:36:57.980 --> 01:36:59.380]
I think they're starting working real hard.

[01:36:59.900 --> 01:37:01.940]
And it says in a copy year that summer's over.

[01:37:02.140 --> 01:37:02.720]
Is summer over?

[01:37:03.060 --> 01:37:03.940]
Well, not yet.

[01:37:04.160 --> 01:37:04.480]
Read the number.

[01:37:04.480 --> 01:37:06.200]
They are barbecues and no more vacations.

[01:37:06.340 --> 01:37:06.840]
Is that true?

[01:37:06.980 --> 01:37:07.140]
No.

[01:37:07.140 --> 01:37:08.820]
This copy is pathetic.

[01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.760]
Anyway, if you want to lose the weight, it doesn't make any difference whether it's summer time,

[01:37:12.200 --> 01:37:15.840]
Sookas winter time, fat people, all of us, we're constantly working to lose weight.

[01:37:15.940 --> 01:37:17.460]
We try every diet under the sun.

[01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.360]
If you want to do it the easy way, do what the beast is doing again.

[01:37:20.460 --> 01:37:21.260]
How's he doing, by the way?

[01:37:21.300 --> 01:37:22.680]
It says he was lost over 50 pounds.

[01:37:23.640 --> 01:37:24.820]
I have to wait a minute lately.

[01:37:26.380 --> 01:37:29.120]
When is this copy, oh, they crossed out the date?

[01:37:31.100 --> 01:37:31.820]
92, 2002.

[01:37:34.800 --> 01:37:35.840]
Oh my god.

[01:37:35.840 --> 01:37:37.240]
A choice, dreadbird, man.

[01:37:37.380 --> 01:37:39.140]
You are an asshole of this guy.

[01:37:39.320 --> 01:37:43.600]
He's always studied like a really kind of like a hard worker, like a real guy.

[01:37:44.640 --> 01:37:46.780]
You like to rub on a bald spot, you're like Buddha.

[01:37:47.100 --> 01:37:47.620]
And come to me.

[01:37:47.620 --> 01:37:48.520]
He's just another one of them.

[01:37:48.600 --> 01:37:49.280]
Anyway, here's the deal.

[01:37:49.820 --> 01:37:52.000]
The beast has lost over 50 pounds of balance for life.

[01:37:52.060 --> 01:37:53.320]
He's back on his black sack.

[01:37:53.880 --> 01:37:55.780]
And the reason that it works is because it's so simple.

[01:37:55.900 --> 01:37:59.220]
Even for simple things like him, it's a piece of cake without the cake because

[01:37:59.840 --> 01:38:02.140]
they let you choose between two alternatives for every meal.

[01:38:02.260 --> 01:38:04.960]
You fill out a little menu once a week and there are two choices for each meal.

[01:38:04.960 --> 01:38:08.460]
And we're talking three gourmet meals and two delicious snacks every single day.

[01:38:08.820 --> 01:38:11.200]
Five feedings a day and they come in little black sack,

[01:38:11.500 --> 01:38:14.120]
which they deliver right to your door every morning by 6 a.m.

[01:38:14.240 --> 01:38:18.140]
No cooking, no shopping, no cleaning, no worries, no calorie counting, no carb counting,

[01:38:18.420 --> 01:38:19.600]
just fresh delicious goodies.

[01:38:19.760 --> 01:38:23.120]
And the beast did tell us a couple of weeks ago the food is now better than ever.

[01:38:23.520 --> 01:38:24.300]
So here's the deal.

[01:38:24.420 --> 01:38:27.220]
If you're tired of being overweight, out of shape, lethargic, diabetic,

[01:38:27.720 --> 01:38:30.100]
walking around wearing pep-pup tents instead of real clothing,

[01:38:30.400 --> 01:38:33.460]

5.6.6.6.6.6.6.

[01:38:53.980 --> 01:38:55.340]
The radio's on your phone.

[01:38:56.240 --> 01:38:56.940]
You win!

[01:38:59.140 --> 01:39:00.240]
Those checkered pants.

[01:39:01.300 --> 01:39:30.220]
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it

[01:39:44.540 --> 01:40:00.200]
do it, do it all right, gonna go round and round right, gonna go round and round right, you see.

[01:40:00.200 --> 01:40:04.740]
So I would not feel the most fooling.

[01:40:04.880 --> 01:40:12.340]
And I would not be ashamed about a ginger and more gay union

[01:40:13.200 --> 01:40:16.280]
Just bold and then stroking away.

[01:40:18.200 --> 01:40:20.640]
For me, Kelly, you're not my guy.

[01:40:22.200 --> 01:40:24.720]
Just sounds like a nine-year-old kid.

[01:40:24.720 --> 01:40:28.520]
And only a macho-menly guy.

[01:40:28.840 --> 01:40:29.820]
You don't know me.

[01:40:30.040 --> 01:40:32.520]
That makes me lift my wings.

[01:40:34.080 --> 01:40:36.420]
It's a joke with a lover of mine.

[01:40:37.480 --> 01:40:40.520]
I bury my oldest baby nose.

[01:40:41.640 --> 01:40:44.040]
Inside his imply rear end.

[01:40:45.740 --> 01:40:49.440]
No, I would not be a sport-old.

[01:40:49.660 --> 01:40:52.880]
If I was not a closet of fame,

[01:40:52.880 --> 01:40:56.920]
That's why a ginger and more gay union

[01:40:56.920 --> 01:40:59.840]
would make me feel guilty.

[01:41:01.540 --> 01:41:03.740]
Everybody follow my thousand balls.

[01:41:04.020 --> 01:41:06.880]
Yeah, ginger and more gay union.

[01:41:07.200 --> 01:41:10.580]
That would make my sorrows only a spill safe.

[01:41:11.480 --> 01:41:14.880]
If we had a ginger and more gay union,

[01:41:15.880 --> 01:41:18.440]
Then they wouldn't have to get me raped, did it?

[01:41:19.940 --> 01:41:22.340]
Just sit right back in the smoke gun.

[01:41:22.520 --> 01:41:24.320]
Join and take a big bonhear or two.

[01:41:24.940 --> 01:41:26.720]
Ever since he was on doby,

[01:41:27.140 --> 01:41:28.760]
Somehow you'll always do.

[01:41:29.300 --> 01:41:31.300]
That he was a great big smoking man.

[01:41:31.580 --> 01:41:33.220]
His hits were strong and true.

[01:41:33.720 --> 01:41:35.540]
Without a lot of God-ja,

[01:41:35.880 --> 01:41:37.460]
He would know what to do.

[01:41:38.080 --> 01:41:39.800]
He would know what to do.

[01:41:42.020 --> 01:41:44.380]
Little times they started getting rough.

[01:41:44.600 --> 01:41:46.100]
His tiny buzz was tossed.

[01:41:46.100 --> 01:41:48.780]
If not for the courage of the old male man,

[01:41:48.980 --> 01:41:50.500]
His package would be lost.

[01:41:50.900 --> 01:41:52.860]
His package would be lost.

[01:41:53.360 --> 01:41:54.880]
And then the police came knocking,

[01:41:55.240 --> 01:41:57.040]
Just diskilling him again to smile.

[01:41:57.580 --> 01:41:58.700]
And downkilling him.

[01:41:59.880 --> 01:42:01.380]
The bag of weed.

[01:42:02.140 --> 01:42:05.100]
A little cocaine and a pipe.

[01:42:06.460 --> 01:42:07.800]
A water bomb.

[01:42:08.520 --> 01:42:10.840]
And out to foot in and jail.

[01:42:11.360 --> 01:42:13.500]
All on Gilligan's car.

[01:42:25.080 --> 01:42:27.780]
Well, we were out on our first date.

[01:42:28.320 --> 01:42:32.000]
After eating at a Mexican can't pay.

[01:42:33.640 --> 01:42:36.100]
Probably where drive it is my car.

[01:42:37.100 --> 01:42:38.100]
She let one's go,

[01:42:38.360 --> 01:42:40.280]
That almost blew us both away.

[01:42:42.080 --> 01:42:44.720]
I asked her to do cut the cheese.

[01:42:45.500 --> 01:42:46.080]
Then she heard me.

[01:42:46.080 --> 01:42:46.080]

[01:42:46.080 --> 01:42:49.920]
I was going around to look at the exact girl's house.

[01:42:51.480 --> 01:42:52.580]
Girl's house.

[01:42:54.320 --> 01:42:56.320]
Girl's on the part,

[01:42:56.760 --> 01:43:00.380]
But I think the older her,

[01:43:00.600 --> 01:43:04.260]
The aided through my clothing and my hat.

[01:43:05.160 --> 01:43:07.940]
And so I rolled the window down.

[01:43:08.260 --> 01:43:10.040]
So I could get some air.

[01:43:10.660 --> 01:43:12.920]
And it felt like something died in there.

[01:43:15.760 --> 01:43:17.240]
Girl's on the part,

[01:43:18.520 --> 01:43:19.900]
Girl's on the part,

[01:43:20.040 --> 01:43:23.260]
She kept on telling me that girl's on the part.

[01:43:23.640 --> 01:43:24.520]
But I knew.

[01:43:27.360 --> 01:43:30.020]
I heard another deadly squirt.

[01:43:30.580 --> 01:43:34.120]
Then I held my nose and covered it with my shirt.

[01:43:35.940 --> 01:43:38.560]
I turned around to get her back.

[01:43:38.560 --> 01:43:40.700]
With just a matter of time,

[01:43:40.820 --> 01:43:42.800]
People are another attack.

[01:43:44.560 --> 01:43:47.040]
So I asked her to do is okay.

[01:43:47.660 --> 01:43:49.100]
Then she looked at me.

[01:43:49.500 --> 01:43:50.620]
Then she had to say,

[01:43:50.860 --> 01:43:52.660]
Well, it's girls on the part.

[01:43:53.660 --> 01:43:55.420]
Girls on the part,

[01:43:55.520 --> 01:43:58.780]
Because I can't see the girls on the part.

[01:43:58.880 --> 01:44:00.120]
But I do.

[01:44:03.740 --> 01:44:05.420]
Girls on the part,

[01:44:06.840 --> 01:44:08.220]
Girls on the part,

[01:44:08.400 --> 01:44:11.400]
Because I can't see the girls on the part.

[01:44:12.200 --> 01:44:13.040]
But I knew.

[01:44:14.740 --> 01:44:15.900]
But I knew.

[01:44:17.580 --> 01:44:18.560]
But I knew.

[01:44:22.500 --> 01:44:25.960]
Hey, look at that schedule.

[01:44:25.960 --> 01:44:27.420]
I'm Thursday, by the way, George.

[01:44:27.860 --> 01:44:29.240]
I'll be the other room. I can't see the schedule.

[01:44:29.620 --> 01:44:30.300]
One o'clock.

[01:44:30.660 --> 01:44:31.780]
I always love those marlins.

[01:44:32.260 --> 01:44:33.440]
Oh, yeah. You lucked out.

[01:44:33.440 --> 01:44:34.640]
You as a bride.

[01:44:35.440 --> 01:44:39.060]
Would they curse my name?

[01:44:40.660 --> 01:44:40.860]
Huh?

[01:44:42.400 --> 01:44:45.200]
If I parted in heaven,

[01:44:48.180 --> 01:44:52.460]
Would I stand the shame?

[01:44:54.960 --> 01:44:59.340]
If I parted in heaven,

[01:45:02.200 --> 01:45:05.680]
Would the Lord she smell?

[01:45:08.660 --> 01:45:12.700]
Send me straight to hell.

[01:45:12.840 --> 01:45:13.120]
Yes.

[01:45:13.480 --> 01:45:19.440]
Or can anybody smell?

[01:45:21.340 --> 01:45:22.640]
Up in heaven?

[01:45:22.640 --> 01:45:24.980]
Up in heaven?

[01:45:36.640 --> 01:45:40.060]
Just gas at the same.

[01:45:43.640 --> 01:45:47.040]
Doesn't linger in heaven.

[01:45:49.340 --> 01:45:54.520]
Would you be ashamed?

[01:45:57.040 --> 01:46:00.760]
To hold my finger in heaven?

[01:46:04.040 --> 01:46:07.920]
I know these things.

[01:46:10.240 --> 01:46:14.380]
When the flat lady sings,

[01:46:14.380 --> 01:46:20.580]
Cause I'll be the one who brings.

[01:46:22.240 --> 01:46:24.180]
Cheers to heaven.

[01:46:28.380 --> 01:46:34.520]
Cause I know I'll be one who brings.

[01:46:35.740 --> 01:46:35.880]
Huh?

[01:46:36.280 --> 01:46:37.820]
Cheers to heaven.

[01:46:41.640 --> 01:46:45.120]
We're sports radio 560, QAM.

[01:46:46.940 --> 01:46:49.940]
This is Joe Boyle, the voice of the Toronto Maple Leafs.

[01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.880]
And you're listening to the Hockey Authority Neal God.

[01:46:55.880 --> 01:47:00.280]
This month on ABC, get ready for all new blue.

[01:47:00.740 --> 01:47:02.820]
And more out of work, child actors.

[01:47:03.300 --> 01:47:06.520]
Any civilist, new partner, stack from Save by the Bell.

[01:47:06.520 --> 01:47:11.960]
Dies in We Cree, only to be replaced by Screech from Save by the Bell.

[01:47:12.220 --> 01:47:15.780]
As he don't have that drink, I'll show this for Bell please.

[01:47:16.100 --> 01:47:20.560]
Then Screech has a run in with new lieutenant Larry Bud Millman.

[01:47:20.700 --> 01:47:22.660]
Hi, I'm I drunk.

[01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:26.520]
In We Crive, Mitha new team of top cops.

[01:47:26.840 --> 01:47:29.840]
George W. Bush and William Jefferson Clinton.

[01:47:30.140 --> 01:47:31.080]
I love you, Harlem.

[01:47:31.280 --> 01:47:32.260]
And I don't have interest.

[01:47:32.260 --> 01:47:37.900]
And in week seven, Fred Re Runberry takes the role of Sergeant Skizzy from Internal Affairs.

[01:47:37.900 --> 01:47:39.460]
Hi, hi, hi, hi.

[01:47:39.580 --> 01:47:42.440]
All new blue with all old actors.

[01:47:42.480 --> 01:47:48.240]
This month on ABC, my fellow Americans, we've entered a new era.

[01:47:48.800 --> 01:47:53.940]
And this new era requires new responsibilities both for the government and for our people.

[01:47:55.080 --> 01:48:00.340]
And we realize that for the first time ever, we do not believe women should be educated

[01:48:00.340 --> 01:48:03.980]
or should have health care or should leave their homes.

[01:48:06.820 --> 01:48:13.780]
People are going about their daily lives working and shopping and playing as shallow materialistic consumers

[01:48:13.780 --> 01:48:16.700]
who care only about getting rich or getting ahead.

[01:48:17.400 --> 01:48:18.520]
And this is good for America.

[01:48:21.260 --> 01:48:26.140]
I'm encouraging school children to kill all Americans and we will prevail.

[01:48:26.140 --> 01:48:27.360]
Good riddance.

[01:48:30.860 --> 01:48:35.600]
MTV presents 9 inch nails unplugged.

[01:48:37.220 --> 01:48:40.420]
I want a f*** you like an animal!

[01:48:41.240 --> 01:48:42.840]
Damn it, this thing's not on!

[01:48:44.340 --> 01:48:45.900]
How come this isn't working?

[01:48:49.040 --> 01:48:52.360]
What you threat you knocked over my bonge?

[01:48:54.660 --> 01:48:59.820]
9 inch nails unplugged only on MTV.

[01:49:04.100 --> 01:49:12.980]
The Middle Eastern world will be exploded to dom at people killed with the gas that we sold him.

[01:49:13.240 --> 01:49:21.240]
First time a crescer nation and the only one that's growing now more blood will be spilled to get that oil flowing.

[01:49:21.240 --> 01:49:32.760]
Forget about Korea and O-S-N-N-T-R-W-E-N is drilling it over and over and to our head.

[01:49:32.980 --> 01:49:39.120]
That iraq has some weapons of master's destruction.

[01:49:49.900 --> 01:49:52.260]
3,000 people killed.

[01:49:52.820 --> 01:49:55.880]
I now forgotten let's exploit them instead.

[01:49:56.420 --> 01:50:02.300]
Hey, there's oil to be gotten going after sent down to Plankato Sama.

[01:50:02.960 --> 01:50:08.900]
There's no longer mention of the name in Latin but no one seemed concerned all.

[01:50:08.900 --> 01:50:26.180]
Company and complacence believe in every word of this cartel administration that controls us by fear through media manipulation and the right wing is drilling it over and over and to our heads.

[01:50:27.060 --> 01:50:32.460]
That iraq has some weapons of master's destruction.

[01:50:42.920 --> 01:50:47.280]
The loss of civil rights is the price that we're paying.

[01:50:47.640 --> 01:50:51.260]
We're all suspects now, not the ash crop is saying.

[01:50:51.800 --> 01:50:53.220]
I have nothing to hide.

[01:50:53.620 --> 01:50:55.460]
Table talkers all are saying.

[01:50:55.880 --> 01:50:59.360]
Blind obedience, cattle don't have any reservation.

[01:50:59.360 --> 01:51:03.820]
Thousand provoked battle ants, world annihilation.

[01:51:04.200 --> 01:51:09.820]
Old regimes must fall in halibur, too, with no objection at all.

[01:51:10.160 --> 01:51:20.020]
Timber crack don't have the balls and the right wing is drilling it over and over and to our parade watch pants.

[01:51:20.020 --> 01:51:25.440]
I rack has some weapons of master's destruction.

[01:51:27.320 --> 01:51:33.760]
Only I rack has some weapons of master's destruction.

[01:51:39.020 --> 01:51:40.520]
Bye bye bye!

[01:51:41.080 --> 01:51:45.420]
The middle watch is shown on 5-sevene don't you hear me? I'm Miami for more days.

[01:51:45.420 --> 01:51:47.380]
That damn fat guy, I can't stand him.
