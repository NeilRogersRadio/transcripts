[00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:16.000]
Why is that on here?

[00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.020]
Robert's on here.

[00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.780]
Because he's fat?

[00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.200]
Oh, oh, M.

[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.080]
Oh, my!

[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:24.180]
Oh, my!

[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.800]
Oh, my!

[00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:28.640]
Oh, my!

[00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:28.960]

[00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:28.960]

[00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:29.040]
Oh, my!

[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:29.440]
Oh, my!

[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:29.440]

[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:29.800]
Oh, my!

[00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:29.980]

[00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:29.980]

[00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.680]
On the down and only rock

[00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.780]
The side of who's saying try to beat the climb

[00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.220]
For hot news, he will pick up

[00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.520]
Who knows what his guy,

[00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:45.980]
Pitting at his mustache

[00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.820]
Small box and anthrax

[00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.380]
He's got a few cans

[00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.020]
And that uranium

[00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.020]
He bought from France

[00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:55.820]
He made a sandwich

[00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.380]
He has just a tan

[00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.280]
Let's give him a little light

[00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.360]
So he can see back dead

[00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.160]
He said American bomb

[00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:07.220]
He said American bomb

[00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.680]
He's got a lot of money

[00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.660]
He's got a lot of money

[00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:13.840]
He's got a lot of money

[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:14.680]
He said American bomb

[00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.380]
He said American bomb

[00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.780]
To keep him all in the wall

[00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:22.540]
Oh, my!

[00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:23.680]
Oh, my!

[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.360]
We did it once before

[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.520]
But now you need some more

[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.660]
Of these American bombs

[00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:30.480]
Yes!

[00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.220]
It's an American bomb

[00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.120]
It's an American bomb

[00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.080]
It's an American bomb

[00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.080]
We did it before

[00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.940]
We had a great time around building this morning

[00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.520]
For the first time that I had a long time

[00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.980]
You know what?

[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:50.400]
Had a great time this morning

[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:50.620]
What?

[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.480]
Why is this morning any different from all the other morning

[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:55.760]
You were hanging out the whole way

[00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:56.560]
Have it a good time

[00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:57.600]
Gildey and I were body

[00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.520]
Zach and I

[00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.060]
In fact, I actually ate Gildey's his cheese sandwich on a whole wheat bread

[00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.760]
And if I were to be it, Zach would have eaten it

[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:06.500]
So I kept him alive

[00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:07.880]
Zach's a good guy but he's fat

[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:09.700]
And why is he on the air

[00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:10.680]
That's our question today

[00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.000]
Why is Zach on the air?

[00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.360]
Sports sports sports sports sports sport sport

[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.980]
And I can't believe that who you are

[00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.640]
Our fat engineer, Julio, who is a great guy

[00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.640]
And I like a lot but I can't believe he was offended because I called him fat

[00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:22.760]
He's not just fat

[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:23.240]
He's like

[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.540]
He prefers pleasantly plump

[00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:27.580]
Is what he's...

[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.980]
Fat, fat tub Julio

[00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:30.740]
Luce him or wait

[00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:31.920]
He's doing adkins

[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.880]
Dr. Bob was on with Paulus on this morning

[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.000]
I see an end and anybody see that

[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.620]
He was on there again, mumbling

[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.180]
And fact, maybe that's why you and Dr. Bob got along so famously that time when we did that appearance

[00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.320]
I didn't even talk to him

[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.480]
Well, you and me, we didn't talk to him

[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.160]
I would be like the mumbles on the back of the door a little bit

[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.000]
Didn't exchange a word because you're a small potatoes

[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.940]
Right, always like since he likes to eat

[00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.040]
And I don't know if that's what I have to do to prefer his alive

[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.340]
So we had nothing to do for his hash browns

[00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:56.560]
I was just reporting what they

[00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.940]
Why Zach on the air?

[00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.560]
Sports, why are you on the air?

[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:01.400]
Can you explain that to me?

[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.280]
He's good, he says

[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.360]
Thanks for the bacon by the way and the cheese sandwich

[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.960]
That was great

[00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:08.560]
No problem

[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.360]
Listen to me, tomorrow when you get food

[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.540]
Of course tomorrow won't be milling around on the hallway

[00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.620]
See it's pleasant here when somebody's out sick

[00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:15.920]
I don't want to mention no names

[00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.180]
But you know what we hate?

[00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.200]
Like old times everybody had a good time this morning

[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.740]
Nobody's like walking on eggshells worried about like watching their back

[00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.680]
Watch your back, Zach, that's what I'm hearing

[00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:26.500]
I hope your mom's not listening

[00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.700]
I want to get nervous, she's probably taking digels

[00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.860]
She's probably popping gaviscon like pez

[00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.620]
But anyway, huh?

[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.020]
Why is he on the air?

[00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:38.060]
Now he's a good guy but he's just he's terrible on the air

[00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:39.780]
He's like the boards, he's like the bigs

[00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.740]
There's another one, he's a good great guy

[00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:43.560]
Sports, but is that it sports?

[00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.880]
Somebody who like his capable and Troy Ackman is coming to the uh

[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.540]
I think if Dave wants that

[00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:51.460]
Uh, made that call

[00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:52.540]
I think he ought to be fired

[00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.400]
If we can verify that Dave wants that

[00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.040]
Called Troy the boy and invited him to come

[00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.880]
First of all, what's Jay Fiedler going to think?

[00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.020]
Oh my god, our good Jewish boy from Dartmouth

[00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:02.700]
Jay Fiedler with the big ears and a bad arm

[00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:03.560]
What's he gonna think?

[00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:05.980]
He's gonna be pissed off and fired up

[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.120]
And you know, when we keep hearing

[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.840]
Well Dave wants that, so God I got Ricky

[00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.400]
And he, well great, more power to him

[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.140]
But you know, one out of two is only 50%

[00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:15.300]
Which ain't that good in football

[00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:16.860]
You know?

[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.380]
Not too good, so if that's to your fire Dave, you're out

[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.920]
If you're tight, if you're concerning with Troy the boy

[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.060]
Because the last thing that we need, the last thing

[00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.220]
And I say we, that the dolphin fans want

[00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:28.520]
Is a f*** quarterback

[00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:29.120]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.820]
Now you can fill them to blank with like washed up

[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:33.320]
Old

[00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:34.820]
Or whatever you like

[00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.360]
I know what Carlos is in there thinking because he's givin' it

[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.040]
He's thinking gay, yeah that's what he's thinking

[00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.140]
Here's the facts from Poppano Park

[00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.500]
From our close personal friends Steve Wolfe and Dick Feinberg

[00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.000]
Who are just obsessed with this program

[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.700]
Find a way I lost money last night

[00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.840]
Not a lot, lost a few bucks

[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.220]
What do you look at me like that for?

[00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:57.740]
Steve Wolfe will keep that 20 that I won off mad dog

[00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:59.560]
Instead of giving it to Carlos

[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.400]
If I wouldn't know you're gonna waste that money on buying faggots out there I would've kept it myself

[00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:06.100]
How much is a cost for a pack of cigarettes nowadays?

[00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:07.820]
I don't know, 275

[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.740]
Am I close?

[00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.340]
Three dollars he said

[00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.880]
Three bucks? Three bucks for a pack of faggots

[00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:14.460]
Eight bucks!

[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.080]
Stop and think about that

[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:17.660]
20 in a pack?

[00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:18.320]
Yeah

[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:20.800]
That's more than a buck of peace

[00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.140]
I mean it's more than like ten cents a piece

[00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:24.940]
How much do come out to ten bucks a piece?

[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.280]
Seriously that's ridiculous

[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.680]
If you took the three bucks for 20 faggots

[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.460]
And you got as a bunch of paper with bad chemicals in it by the way

[00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.700]
I don't think it's the tobacco

[00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:36.540]
I think it's the paper that goes to

[00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:38.140]
No I'm Tonya

[00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:39.740]
And the ammonia and the rat poop

[00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:42.620]
If you get some good rappers and rat pee on like they do in Amsterdam

[00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:45.220]
Then you'd have like higher quality more concentrated

[00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:46.760]
It's probably more spazier than you

[00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:47.860]
Pure finer cancer

[00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.260]
A gigantic pristine tumor

[00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:52.840]
Isn't that what we all long for?

[00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:54.040]
It's not a tumor

[00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:57.080]
Remember in the movie The Ace or The Great Santini?

[00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:58.340]
Remember what his name was?

[00:05:59.140 --> 00:05:59.460]
Tumor?

[00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:01.900]
Yes, that was a good movie

[00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:05.000]
Well I'll tell you I'm just wait how come we're all such a good mood this morning

[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.940]
We don't want you to feel bad because I know you're listening mo

[00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:09.400]
We hope that you're better right on which it had bad health on anybody although

[00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:10.500]
But anyway

[00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:12.480]
But we just had a good time

[00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.980]
Like you said it rekindled the old times like with the first team

[00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:16.420]
Everybody friendly out there in the hallway

[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.160]
We have a nice little alcohol

[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:21.180]
The oldies seem to be handling it just fine in there and the show too

[00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:25.000]
With the help of Zach and Robert of course

[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.320]
Right of course with their fantastic helping of course the help of how he's who I think

[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:29.600]
Brought all that good food in there

[00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:33.240]
I'm pretty sure it was I don't know

[00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.580]
They're with the whole wheat cheese sandwich

[00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:37.440]
Very plain, very all

[00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.740]
I was gonna say all American I was probably British

[00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:41.500]
Yeah but with lots of butter which is why it was good

[00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:42.400]
Why do you say lots of butter?

[00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:45.220]
Well I tell you one thing my brain's out right afterward

[00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:47.280]
It's the only way they make it just like it's a fun rocker

[00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:50.260]
So if you got a sense of stomach you'll need to fun rockers

[00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.760]
I like their food a lot but yeah they butter the bun

[00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:54.220]
All you can tell them don't butter the bun

[00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:56.260]
Hold the butter what fun is that

[00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:59.980]
You ever tell them to hold the butter and they stand there holding it just like this?

[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:00.560]
No they do

[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:03.340]
Anyway here's this

[00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:09.500]
In fact see we can be having a great time in here every day on this radio station like the old times

[00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:12.480]
But there's this alright you know this is good that it happened

[00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:16.520]
I hope he's feeling okay and he's back you know sometime in next month or two

[00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:21.260]
But the fact of the matter is that there's like a dark cloud that hangs over this station

[00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:27.960]
In these morning hours it's like I guess it's not like this one I'm out of town doing the show

[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:29.240]
What do you mean?

[00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:35.300]
But I mean here it's just now today was fantastic

[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:38.640]
Listen how much happy everybody is today everybody

[00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:44.420]
Why don't you want to work in a workplace it's a hostile environment where you come in everybody's peeking around a corner

[00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:48.100]
Or you're gonna have a close encounter with somebody who hates you like poison and you hate them

[00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:50.860]
Or you're gonna like say the wrong thing and you know

[00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:57.180]
You have to overt all those you know when you're walking out of hallway you have to like do the green apple quicks

[00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:59.280]
They'll avoid all the daggers that are going up and down the hall

[00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:03.600]
Kill some people yeah not to mention the water now he's got her ear to the wall monitoring

[00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:09.640]
Oh this is such a pleasant day today little to be expected anyway the effects says

[00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:13.560]
Dick want to mean the fact she's kind of planning a special match race at Pompoon Park between

[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.220]
Seymour butz and Fox Valley Tushy those are two of the horses who are racing right now to track

[00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:19.440]
Seymour butz

[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.880]
Seymour butz by the way one of the great I'm not gonna say great but one of the most prolific

[00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:29.740]
Prenographers in history of the business what do you think they got about 75,000 different titles out

[00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:35.680]
Seymour butz at least I can't remember what do you mean you guess it said that's almost as bad as the race announcer

[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:39.780]
Liberty Bell Park Joe Icoran calling back in the early 1980s and driver still to

[00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:43.200]
Campolis pulled out his little pickle in the center of the track and is now driving at home

[00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:45.280]
Little pickle is the name of the horse

[00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:51.740]
Now can you imagine how much spirit time somebody's got on her hands to be faxing me this kind of dribble

[00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:55.280]
I'll at least need to mention David Ingram today and quite frankly I can see why

[00:08:55.880 --> 00:09:01.880]
Don't take it personal day you're okay but you're not getting our money anyway big event tomorrow for George

[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:05.520]
Where are we probably missing a head of time?

[00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:06.800]
I don't know kill time.

[00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:13.040]
Joy George tomorrow for happy hour at five to seven of treasurer I'm located off the Palmetto just north of the 120 second street exit

[00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:19.600]
Stop by for prizes and drink specials tomorrow afternoon and probably see more butz will be there hanging it out

[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:24.380]
You'll see more butz if you go there probably then you do sit around alone at home unless you got a mirror

[00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:30.980]
So anyway our facts yesterday I mean our poll whatever it is we got a tremendous response about George unbelievable

[00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:39.820]
See I'm surprised about this because for somebody that's his vanilla and boring and as George you wouldn't think that we'd get that

[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:47.560]
Hostel I mean just in general that emotional of a response but you do generate a tremendous emotional response not

[00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:52.360]
Not necessarily a good one but you can't have everything where would you put it?

[00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:57.540]
So we'll get to the results of that poll in a moment and then we got today's poll which we'll be building because obviously

[00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:05.200]
And we want to really thank Howard Cohen the Miami hero for at least don't go out and buying a radio the story was a piece of crap

I

[00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:32.860]
To everyone knows what would happen to a man unlucky enough to survive an attack by a werewolf

Recurting it to you and turning you into

[00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:14.440]
Where cow?

[00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:23.800]
Coming from outrageous someone else I agree 916 at 560 WK by the way we already know about the a fox piece this morning as they continue with their right wing of

[00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:30.240]
Diet times we don't really care because like red China we don't recognize fox news on this program are they a news?

[00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:37.500]
No they're just a right wing arm they're in a pindage of the administration which we don't recognize tonight's the big night by the way you're going to be watching out to state the union

[00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:46.640]
I'm not no no I'll be watching hockey games all women all the time soft lures light fm breaks new ground with a female DJ lineup

[00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:54.940]
I mean the idea that a bunch of right wing assholes sitting up in New York or whatever the hell are broadcasting from that they're going to like manipulate us or have anything to do with this program in Miami

[00:13:55.840 --> 00:14:01.300]
It's ludicrous on the face of it on the face of it so butt out find some real stuff to talk about

[00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:06.340]
Yeah like there's a few kami pinkos run on the loose besides us

[00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:12.560]
And here's a picture of the entire stamina is go Kimba oh and game a great view down look at grandview

[00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:20.940]
Dell he don't look a day over 80 boy look at that you mentioned his name and there's the picture now how does he fit into that he wears a skirt to work I guess does he really I don't know maybe he's the PD

[00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:29.660]
No he is not the PD the PD is some guy Kevin Carter I don't know he's he's from I don't know who the PD is

[00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:38.560]
Rock Jack Kimba I didn't read the whole thing because quite frankly it's boring itself and they play slush music why would a station that play slush me why would that be a big thing

[00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:47.300]
That a PlayStation that plays the carpenters all day long or whatever hell they play is got all female DJ's nobody listen to the DJ's on that station

[00:14:48.300 --> 00:15:08.140]
Other than Kimba with her very hard and there's a picture of Kimba look at that where she puts that who you to shame what's he going about 425 these days she's a Hawking woman Kimba me Kimba you shwok that's her whole stick I'm looking for the name of the PD or how it is the Greg butel fits in at light FM

[00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:25.320]
Let's see the program director there his name is something Sydney miss Sydney is Sylvia Sydney I don't know who it is I don't have time to screw around with it but on the picture there he is there is Ellen Jaffy isn't she a magic reject Ellen Jaffy or was she on was she on go though

[00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:37.640]
Big the day before she on big she she was on the issue on something Ron Phillips I think he's the PD Kimba Gail Garten Susan Wise Ellen Jaffy and Greg VL how does she fit into it?

[00:15:38.800 --> 00:16:08.120]
I think that's an excellent question maybe somebody has the answer for us how Greg VL fits in on all female lineup on light FM why would anybody write an article about that and then not to be out done new times has got a big piece this week culture that's KULCH you are that's to be real oh artsy far see hip hop till you drop yet another South Florida radio station enters the fray this time on autopilot and it's all about the MIB men in black used to be she wants to put a time on a

[00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:15.380]
great station and then they bought the station and destroyed it first tax and an outtip channel would destroy everything they touch at least that's what kid curry says

[00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:30.740]
kid curry is widely quote in here he says for Christ sakes everybody plays hip hop scoffs kid curry program director power 96.5 the chief Miami competition for WMIB along with the similarly hip hop R&B form at a WEDR rank number one and two respectively audio audio

[00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:58.080]
on the noting the private functions is on air DJ's work curry continues we have mixers who play a party's for major corporations here the executive sitting there all over 30 and they're all getting play hip hop don't forget those 30 year olds have grown up with hip hop it's nothing new them anymore say homogenized world is that a homogenized world and that goes on about David Ross says this and David Ross said that it's an excellent so on we don't really care about that because we don't listen to hip hop do you listen hip hop

[00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:15.720]
I'm trying to think about if I do not is it a tough question not a person I wouldn't know whatever we're gotten that kind of response I would like to send a memo and writing think about it from an away from the back you could have emailed me I don't make it a point to sometimes it's a lot of you listen to hip hop

[00:17:16.340 --> 00:17:23.120]
yeah you know listen to hip hop don't give me that missy Elliott that's okay when she comes on MTV do you really it's got the bees and

[00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:34.240]
kind of a weird video yeah so anyway I have nothing to with us because I don't think anybody here really listen to you listen to WMIB now we don't listen to men in black everybody vehemently shaking their head

[00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:44.240]
but that Carlos's cap just spun around like Linda Blair's head and we don't listen to a light FM no in fact even I'm far too much to admit ever to be listening to light FM

[00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:52.000]
which I never I wouldn't know where to find it on the dial 101.5 I have no idea well it said that in the article I don't listen to it well I don't listen to FM period here there's nothing

[00:17:52.000 --> 00:18:04.460]
to listen to on FM why not at pull come out yesterday George but pull the pull about you why do you hate George so much he's boring a Schmidt 435 31.3%

[00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:10.900]
which yeah I mean that's something you can't help you're just boring that's just you they're not holding it against you necessarily they might

[00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:27.300]
I don't hate him he's okay 364 and I don't hate him I love George 267 you put those two together you got 48.7% nearly half what are you smoking about nearly half either love George or say he's okay

[00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:45.060]
now that means that a little bit more than half say something in the territory as in he's boring a Schmidt 435% he's a nasty little spick 107 people said that too much eating ass talk 51 people he's an anti-Semite 41 too much religion talk 31 and too much mumbling

[00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:58.060]
the movement like 25 is what they be saying so I think what they're trying to say is that George loses about 50% of the audience when he's on we used to think it was

[00:18:58.060 --> 00:19:08.240]
little less than that but I think now the real numbers are coming out slaying said to be soprano's imitation another show that I don't watch two young men this is Santa

[00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:27.420]
and a California two young men killed their mother and tried to cover their tracks by chopping off her head and hands the way they saw done on the sopranos authority said yesterday Jason boutista 20 is 15 year old half brother was not identified because of his age and which half were arrested over the weekend for investigation of the murder share a share of Michael Corona said

[00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:37.480]
Corona refused to say where Jane and boutista 41 was killed but said a preliminary autopsy showed she was strangled her head and hands were found in the apartment she shared with her sons in Riverside east of LA

[00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:46.420]
I don't know what mode of you could possibly give her killing your mother Corona said the family originally from Illinois moved to California six years ago and moved into the Riverside apartment about six months ago

[00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:56.740]
according to the sheriff of teased it was killed in this member janeway 14 the sons allegedly tried to dump her body in ocean side the next day were spotted by a security guard and ended up throwing the body in norenged county ravine

[00:19:56.740 --> 00:20:11.980]
the guard gave police the license number of Jason boutista's car obviously a rocket scientist Jason boutista desk clerk at the holiday in the non terrier was arrested at California State University in San Bernardino January 24 allegedly told investigators he and his brother lived with their mom but they hadn't seen her for weeks but soon confessed

[00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:18.660]
boutista also told investigators he had seen an episode of the surprise where he saw the same type of dismemberment that had been done before dumping a body

[00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:25.660]
the brothers did this he said because they believe it would take away any identifying information that law enforcement could use a rainbow schedule for today

[00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:34.460]
how do you like that real rocket scientist killed off mom I mean I think a lot of us if we ever decided to kill off mom would be a lot more clever than that George

[00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:57.820]
yeah you got the feed off too let's see Kimba is the resident now that's terrible calling Kimba like a bold something like a bull in the china shop that's what it said when you people stop picking on poor just because she has a deep voice and she looks you know like was that a bulletin that was a bull it's in five six seven oh five six you are having a

[00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:07.780]
poll yet they're not going to call you want to call about that we're not going to discuss that stupid thing I mean we could but I wouldn't waste my time we don't recognize box news or hither or anybody that faxes about that

[00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:25.180]
if you if you could see the ass sucking faxes in there from the unmancatable one you know HH from wherever he's from this week it's just amazing to me the mental illness that permeates this community and it's it's scary one day just yesterday faxes which I don't read more than like two or three words

[00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:40.660]
saying the lashing out about you mostly about little spec a Jew and all this other crap and then today like well this morning I saw on Fox we don't care okay don't you understand we don't care we don't like you we don't want to hear from you we can't stand you we find you anxious we wish that the air you breathe will be

[00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:52.180]
beautified by bull and excrement okay we just can't stand anything about you HH or whatever had your call yourself this week chronic faxing idiot you here's our facts today I mean our poll why do I keep saying that I don't

[00:21:52.240 --> 00:22:05.120]
try to get my facts straight who is that we've done this before but it's fun we like doing this and the audience likes doing it because they don't have to think too hard who is the hottest person that is public figure the reason I put public figure

[00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:17.180]
on here is because we don't want to say oh Mary Schwartz down the road we don't know from Mary Schwartz okay plus Mary is a game for goyam anyway do you need Jews name Mary beside that one in the Bible no no

[00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:27.580]
frankly it's for goyam who is the hottest person in the world public figure here's the list we could I compiled so far so far obviously many more to come Britney Spears

[00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:39.620]
howie Berry she not looking at good these days howie she's not Brad Pitt well I put I put guys on here because there

[00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:45.780]
obviously some women and some others like me who may be a little on right want to vote for guys J. Lowe

[00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:49.380]
Rackham Tom Welling Tom Brady and a corner Kovah

[00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:56.460]
Carmen Electra Elizabeth Hurley what covered Electra you don't think she's gonna get votes Carmen Electra

[00:22:56.460 --> 00:23:01.920]
yeah a couple Elizabeth Hurley Sharon Stone who's old but nevertheless she'll get some votes Cameron D.

[00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:06.240]
Us and Penelope Cruz that's my short list with the audience having the opportunity to add many many more

[00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:13.140]
Penelope Cruz that big crooked he does have a big crooked nose I have a beautiful picture Penelope Cruz in one of the tabloids right here

[00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:20.180]
she didn't have a big crew you only wish you had a big crooked one like that and quite frankly so to a lot of us but nevertheless

[00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:25.980]
so there's the list we got so far we'll see the tremendous look at the outpouring and the response we're getting so far already

[00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:34.300]
do I do our list as in none five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line

[00:28:13.420 --> 00:28:16.900]
on what who's that who is that screaming on the phone to you because I can't hear them

[00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:24.600]
who is that it's Joe Joe who I can't put you on the hotline we can't put you on on the hotline

[00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:29.220]

overnight show and then he got married you put those two together and quite frankly we don't

[00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:01.320]
want to see him anymore either so we had well first of all does it really make a difference the

[00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:04.620]
fact of the matter is that everybody in this building comes in here and dicks around the audience

[00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:09.100]
doesn't care about this the audience is waiting here at radio show and how long is this

a project that you're working on how long is this going to take Carlos till about about 1245

[00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:21.160]
1250 he said 1253 40 just until we go into the last break he said

[00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:28.060]

[00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:09.900]
just one big one kind of like a Mariah Carey in the middle of her chest and Tom Brady's got one

[00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:15.140]

for customer five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on a AT&T I mean I realized that

[00:54:54.290 --> 00:54:58.570]

[00:54:58.570 --> 00:55:05.950]
know they they can afford to pick like five ten see what I'm saying 15 20 15 or 20 but try to

[00:55:05.950 --> 00:55:10.290]
narrow it down to just one just for old time six and since that's what the question is not who are

[00:55:10.290 --> 00:55:15.490]

gorge for a couple of all sorts tickets but yeah oh this guy it's a crazy guy again it's a crazy

[00:57:20.590 --> 00:57:24.510]
backdust that she makes my toes thing okay put that cheese right at the door she'll be in about

[00:57:24.510 --> 00:57:30.910]
a half an hour Christina Aguilera she gets gorge going she gets me going right to the bowl

[00:57:31.870 --> 00:57:36.930]
especially her videos the one the Mulan Rouge one that was that was bad enough where she looked

[00:57:36.930 --> 00:57:42.330]
like Minnie Mouse and Heat but the new one about what is it called the dirty dirty dirty ass

[00:57:42.330 --> 00:57:46.650]
beautiful dirty and grotesque and mousey I went that piercing she's got a she is

[00:57:46.650 --> 00:57:53.750]
mousey man mousey mousey mousey in fact if I'm flipping the channels and I see here I immediately

[00:57:53.750 --> 00:57:59.330]
blurred out automatically I go oh I can't just like that that's how mousey looking at bitches

[00:57:59.830 --> 00:58:04.630]
but you know she's on TV a lot she's in the videos she's making music or something close by

[00:58:05.210 --> 00:58:09.330]
something similar and see this I think this is interesting don't you the way because I would

[00:58:09.330 --> 00:58:15.610]
some in the past we've done them disservice we always said other than Britney Spears or Brad Pitt

[00:58:15.610 --> 00:58:21.330]
see well well why do we have to do that put them in there and let them stand up on their own two

[00:58:21.330 --> 00:58:27.330]
things and where is that picture Britney without the makeup maybe she's skanky looking I don't think

[00:58:27.330 --> 00:58:31.510]
so but I guess it's possible a lot of people without makeup you might be surprised if that Carlos

[00:58:31.510 --> 00:58:35.650]
is going to start wearing makeup tomorrow see if it's an improvement you know no I doubt it can't

[00:58:35.650 --> 00:58:42.910]
hurt that much we know it definitely can't hurt did you look at the picture on the QM email no you

[00:58:42.910 --> 00:58:50.430]
hard-hearted little bastard well why not the guy look on the QM dot com you you look at it

[00:58:51.450 --> 00:58:56.390]
and if it's bad enough forced George to look at who he sent it to I don't know no oh that's

[00:58:56.390 --> 00:59:02.190]
right he probably sent it to us on there which we don't get those that's because they just won't

[00:59:02.190 --> 00:59:08.990]
listen to us they took us days days just for the first part of that to put up a link to our website

[00:59:08.990 --> 00:59:12.050]
and because there are much a hard asses over here in this place because they don't want to be

[00:59:12.050 --> 00:59:15.630]
associated with this program and quite frankly we don't want to be associated with them

[00:59:16.690 --> 00:59:20.610]
and so we said okay that's fine you got the link to our website on QM dot com under my picture

[00:59:20.610 --> 00:59:26.510]
there now please either you remove where it says email kneel since we don't do email or just

[00:59:27.010 --> 00:59:31.250]
disable it so that when people click there they know to click below because it doesn't do anything

[00:59:31.250 --> 00:59:35.970]
did they do that no so when you click the email it's still it's still uh that looks like it's

[00:59:35.970 --> 00:59:40.790]
got to do something and they fill out the email which goes like to a dead end I think it goes into

[00:59:40.790 --> 00:59:47.290]
clearances back down file isn't that pathetic that you have to go through so much angst just

[00:59:47.290 --> 00:59:52.390]

check it I'll sit there actually he will actually go through the work I check it with he wants you

[01:00:32.530 --> 01:00:36.250]
to send him like 50 dollars in exchange for that just to show you the tremendous sacrifice he's

[01:00:36.250 --> 01:00:42.730]
making for you he's still unlucky by the way 10 past 10 at 560 wqa we all have different lifestyles

that's I'm not making that up I'm not exaggerating that's exactly how that went down now was Johnny

[01:13:18.890 --> 01:13:22.930]
Depp would have been quite that friendly which he was friendly but not that friendly because Johnny

[01:13:22.930 --> 01:13:28.510]

[01:18:08.470 --> 01:18:09.110]
Who's got a problem?

[01:18:09.370 --> 01:18:11.850]
Little bald head at time, jick over there to sunset and who's a geek?

[01:18:12.850 --> 01:18:13.650]
Oh, he's on a touch.

[01:18:13.650 --> 01:18:19.410]
Let me tell you something, Mr. Jika, you haven't written anything about anything going on local in about 400 years, okay?

[01:18:19.590 --> 01:18:21.190]
And I'm out of touch with what's going on here.

[01:18:21.530 --> 01:18:25.650]
We just had a rating book come out, AMFMPM, MIB is on here.

[01:18:25.750 --> 01:18:26.710]
Now, what's the heraldas discovered?

[01:18:26.890 --> 01:18:28.030]
You haven't.

[01:18:29.050 --> 01:18:32.490]
We kicked ass again here in the middle of a grotesque book for this radio station.

[01:18:32.810 --> 01:18:34.930]
All the other things that are going on in radio and TV.

[01:18:35.910 --> 01:18:36.750]
Does he write about them?

[01:18:36.830 --> 01:18:36.930]
No.

[01:18:37.010 --> 01:18:39.870]
No, another big puff piece today again about NetworkCraft.

[01:18:40.210 --> 01:18:41.670]
Anybody could write that from anywhere.

[01:18:41.670 --> 01:18:42.670]
They could be like on a moon.

[01:18:42.870 --> 01:18:44.730]
They could be on the rings of Saturn and write that crap.

[01:18:45.410 --> 01:18:47.710]
And he's got the hoots but the balls to be talking about.

[01:18:47.870 --> 01:18:49.750]
Well, it'll be hard for him to feel the pulse.

[01:18:49.950 --> 01:18:53.150]
You know something Tom, it's hard for anybody to feel the pulse where it is not even their own.

[01:18:54.630 --> 01:18:55.930]
And you're part of the problem.

[01:18:56.250 --> 01:18:57.330]
This place is Dead'sville.

[01:18:58.690 --> 01:19:02.250]
Brittany for Love says Greg, not that Greg.

[01:19:02.930 --> 01:19:06.170]
When I'm a good boy, Sarah Serena for discipline when I'm a bad boy.

[01:19:07.290 --> 01:19:07.650]
Serena.

[01:19:08.390 --> 01:19:10.910]
And the best of everything, Love Greg says.

[01:19:11.530 --> 01:19:13.730]
Not that not the one in any of the other ones.

[01:19:13.730 --> 01:19:14.850]
We know so many of them these days.

[01:19:16.450 --> 01:19:19.530]
Here's one that says you might have mold growing and at building a mold inspector.

[01:19:19.890 --> 01:19:22.050]
That building needs to have air sampling test done right away.

[01:19:22.350 --> 01:19:23.470]
Absolutely correct.

[01:19:23.770 --> 01:19:26.550]
Call me Mike at Yadi Yadi Yadi, Abel Home Inspections.

[01:19:28.450 --> 01:19:29.370]
He's got a phone number.

[01:19:29.610 --> 01:19:31.150]
Well, we can't do that because we're not authorized.

[01:19:31.610 --> 01:19:33.930]
It might not be economically expedient at this time.

[01:19:34.850 --> 01:19:36.930]
To do something about the death in the building.

[01:19:36.930 --> 01:19:39.230]
I'm telling you, there's definitely a disease in events.

[01:19:40.170 --> 01:19:42.070]
Sounds like a major, major lawsuit.

[01:19:42.270 --> 01:19:42.930]
Uh-huh to me.

[01:19:44.030 --> 01:19:45.750]
Against the proprietors of this sick building.

[01:19:46.130 --> 01:19:47.690]
Lucy Lynn or is that Lucy Liu?

[01:19:48.070 --> 01:19:48.610]
Lucy Liu.

[01:19:48.870 --> 01:19:49.330]
Lucy Liu?

[01:19:49.570 --> 01:19:50.210]
Lucy Liu?

[01:19:50.930 --> 01:19:51.570]
Charlie's Angels.

[01:19:51.770 --> 01:19:52.930]
Is she Liu McVeele?

[01:19:53.070 --> 01:19:53.430]
How is Lucy Liu?

[01:19:54.650 --> 01:19:57.170]
Did the guy with a glasses die from Charlie's Angels?

[01:19:57.350 --> 01:19:59.670]
The guy, uh, the police chief?

[01:20:00.810 --> 01:20:01.530]
I don't know.

[01:20:01.770 --> 01:20:03.790]
You know the one with the thick lenses, the lady.

[01:20:03.850 --> 01:20:04.590]
I know you're talking about it.

[01:20:04.630 --> 01:20:05.130]
I don't know if he died.

[01:20:05.130 --> 01:20:05.750]
I think he died.

[01:20:06.210 --> 01:20:06.470]
He died.

[01:20:06.470 --> 01:20:07.130]
Look it up, Carlos.

[01:20:07.670 --> 01:20:09.470]
Look up the guy with a glasses from Charlie's Angels.

[01:20:11.150 --> 01:20:12.210]
I'm pretty sure he died.

[01:20:12.650 --> 01:20:13.650]
He was in a lot of good stuff.

[01:20:13.810 --> 01:20:14.990]
I got in my nerves.

[01:20:14.990 --> 01:20:15.950]
He had a very annoying voice.

[01:20:16.770 --> 01:20:17.610]
Uh, T. Alley Oni.

[01:20:19.650 --> 01:20:21.110]
Who makes the hell of a macaroni?

[01:20:21.330 --> 01:20:22.090]
You don't T. Alley Oni?

[01:20:24.910 --> 01:20:25.470]
What about her?

[01:20:27.250 --> 01:20:28.750]
Lucy Liu, is she going on here?

[01:20:29.690 --> 01:20:30.590]
A lot of people like her.

[01:20:30.970 --> 01:20:31.730]
Okay, she's not.

[01:20:32.050 --> 01:20:33.150]
What do you do with that to me?

[01:20:33.990 --> 01:20:35.890]
I'm not asking you to cancel her beauty.

[01:20:35.930 --> 01:20:37.750]
This can't all be the world accordion of the Georgian.

[01:20:37.770 --> 01:20:38.850]
You're a narrow taste.

[01:20:39.410 --> 01:20:39.990]
Sure, kid.

[01:20:40.410 --> 01:20:40.730]
Okay.

[01:20:41.570 --> 01:20:45.890]
Just like the guys that are on here, do you think that I want to put, uh, who'd I put on here?

[01:20:46.310 --> 01:20:48.050]
Like a, uh, Brad Pitt?

[01:20:50.230 --> 01:20:51.010]
Old meat, man.

[01:20:51.170 --> 01:20:51.510]
Old meat.

[01:20:51.830 --> 01:20:52.550]
Lucy Liu's on here.

[01:20:52.650 --> 01:20:53.550]
What about T. Alley Oni?

[01:20:53.950 --> 01:20:54.890]
With her hot macaroni?

[01:20:56.210 --> 01:20:57.610]
I know who she is.

[01:20:57.830 --> 01:20:59.210]
Um, she's not ugly.

[01:21:00.770 --> 01:21:01.730]
I wouldn't call her hot.

[01:21:01.730 --> 01:21:02.530]
She's not ugly.

[01:21:03.030 --> 01:21:05.690]
The question is, who is the hottest person in the world in Georgia's?

[01:21:05.770 --> 01:21:06.590]
She's not ugly.

[01:21:06.830 --> 01:21:06.910]
Okay.

[01:21:07.070 --> 01:21:08.610]
So in other words, let's make a list.

[01:21:09.110 --> 01:21:10.030]
This is, we can do that.

[01:21:10.050 --> 01:21:11.450]
You think the other list ran along with it?

[01:21:11.630 --> 01:21:12.230]
One of the opinions.

[01:21:12.450 --> 01:21:14.550]
We can do this from now and she'll be in the contract.

[01:21:14.790 --> 01:21:15.350]
You can't get the ears.

[01:21:15.710 --> 01:21:16.650]
She's mediocre looking.

[01:21:16.850 --> 01:21:18.170]
So now we're not putting her on her.

[01:21:18.230 --> 01:21:18.390]
No, no.

[01:21:18.630 --> 01:21:20.670]
No, adequate doesn't, let me sit again.

[01:21:20.750 --> 01:21:23.550]
One more time before I start getting real hostile and vote on yesterday's poll again.

[01:21:24.530 --> 01:21:25.570]
I'm answering the question.

[01:21:27.210 --> 01:21:28.270]
Attiquate doesn't cut it.

[01:21:28.410 --> 01:21:29.810]
So the answer is no.

[01:21:30.990 --> 01:21:31.310]
No.

[01:21:31.510 --> 01:21:31.510]

[01:21:32.290 --> 01:21:33.250]
The hottest person in the world.

[01:21:33.410 --> 01:21:36.270]
If she's the hottest person in the world, I will just stick to doing ourselves is what you're

[01:21:36.270 --> 01:21:36.450]
saying.

[01:21:36.830 --> 01:21:40.330]
I could ask you about that damn spot and about that guy saying, especially, okay?

[01:21:40.770 --> 01:21:40.890]
Who?

[01:21:41.170 --> 01:21:42.190]
I got nothing to do with that.

[01:21:42.530 --> 01:21:43.530]
How about LL Cool J?

[01:21:43.690 --> 01:21:44.890]
Somebody says, what do you say to that?

[01:21:45.810 --> 01:21:46.130]
Sure.

[01:21:47.710 --> 01:21:49.550]
Now, how do you like, oh, this is Captain Rick again.

[01:21:49.610 --> 01:21:50.990]
I think it's had a little bit too much this morning.

[01:21:52.310 --> 01:21:54.430]
Maybe Captain Rick is that crazy guy that calls.

[01:21:56.190 --> 01:21:58.730]
You know, the one I always refer to was the crazy guy that we had on Wildback.

[01:21:58.730 --> 01:22:00.250]
Maybe that's Captain Rick.

[01:22:00.250 --> 01:22:00.390]
I don't know.

[01:22:00.430 --> 01:22:01.390]
Just look at the handwriting here.

[01:22:02.330 --> 01:22:03.790]
I think Captain Rick is losing it.

[01:22:03.850 --> 01:22:04.970]
Aubrey Harman.

[01:22:06.810 --> 01:22:07.650]
Who is that?

[01:22:07.850 --> 01:22:08.270]
Is that a guy?

[01:22:08.650 --> 01:22:09.130]
No.

[01:22:09.810 --> 01:22:10.990]
Well, maybe it is.

[01:22:11.370 --> 01:22:14.030]
Jason Seahorn, football player.

[01:22:15.390 --> 01:22:18.690]
Oh, she's Jason Seahorn's wife is the hottest.

[01:22:19.490 --> 01:22:20.770]
Aubrey Harman, though idea.

[01:22:21.810 --> 01:22:24.490]
Is she kind of like Donnie Harman, Tom Harman?

[01:22:25.230 --> 01:22:28.530]
Now, Tom Harman's son, Mark Harman.

[01:22:29.070 --> 01:22:29.610]
Very good.

[01:22:30.030 --> 01:22:33.830]
And he was married to Florida, Tennessee.

[01:22:35.970 --> 01:22:37.350]
What did they have to do with Rick Nelson?

[01:22:37.530 --> 01:22:39.130]
Wasn't Rick Nelson married to his sister?

[01:22:39.630 --> 01:22:40.090]
I don't know.

[01:22:41.050 --> 01:22:41.330]
Huh?

[01:22:41.650 --> 01:22:44.730]
And then Rick Nelson died in a plane crash because he was doing something on the plane.

[01:22:45.390 --> 01:22:46.630]
And his kids had no other kids on the show.

[01:22:46.850 --> 01:22:50.150]
Kids were real long here and I had him on the show and they said no, they don't sleep naked together.

[01:22:50.150 --> 01:22:51.010]
And they wanted to beat me up.

[01:22:51.650 --> 01:22:52.530]
And what else?

[01:22:52.910 --> 01:22:53.710]
And they had that music.

[01:22:53.810 --> 01:22:55.230]
But what did Mark Harman have to do with that?

[01:22:55.370 --> 01:22:56.650]
Well, he was, he was married to whom.

[01:22:56.870 --> 01:22:57.590]
Who was doing who?

[01:22:57.590 --> 01:22:59.410]
Then also kids were doing each other.

[01:23:00.390 --> 01:23:01.770]
And Ozzy was doing Harriet.

[01:23:02.150 --> 01:23:03.010]
And who was Mark Harman?

[01:23:03.770 --> 01:23:05.590]
Mark Harman was a football player.

[01:23:05.850 --> 01:23:06.650]
UCLA, quarterback.

[01:23:07.830 --> 01:23:09.390]
See, I know a little bit about football.

[01:23:09.610 --> 01:23:12.410]
OK, all you assholes out there that think I'm not a, because I'm an old fag.

[01:23:12.550 --> 01:23:12.810]
Sorry.

[01:23:13.490 --> 01:23:17.250]
What I've forgotten about sports would make me dangerous on this station if I ever remembered it.

[01:23:18.390 --> 01:23:21.310]
And here comes Francis O'Hare on the outside with Bucky Dale.

[01:23:21.530 --> 01:23:21.850]
Oh, sorry.

[01:23:22.330 --> 01:23:25.570]
Let's go back and talk on Harness Racing from 1960 at Hazel Park.

[01:23:25.570 --> 01:23:25.930]
OK.

[01:23:27.650 --> 01:23:30.390]
Let's talk about some of those great looking Harness Racing drivers.

[01:23:31.670 --> 01:23:34.770]
Like Terry Morgan used to be about 30 years ago when he could drive.

[01:23:34.990 --> 01:23:35.590]
Oh, sorry, Terry.

[01:23:36.590 --> 01:23:39.670]
Let's see, Captain Rick says, Aubrey Harman.

[01:23:41.150 --> 01:23:42.590]
OK, Faxes are coming in.

[01:23:42.690 --> 01:23:43.690]
The votes are poured in on there.

[01:23:43.790 --> 01:23:49.710]
Although a lot of people still don't have any, which makes me consistently wonder why do people nominate these people on every pool all the time?

[01:23:49.790 --> 01:23:50.770]
And nobody ever gets any votes.

[01:23:52.230 --> 01:23:53.110]
Anyone know why?

[01:23:53.410 --> 01:23:55.490]
Because they look at the pool and they say, oh, I'm voting for Brittany.

[01:23:55.870 --> 01:23:59.190]
Although I did call in about Kristen, but I'm voting for Brittany.

[01:23:59.610 --> 01:24:02.770]
So what do you call in for Kristen, then, Damn it. Does Kristen have any votes yet?

[01:24:03.990 --> 01:24:05.550]
Oh, almost everybody's got at least one now.

[01:24:05.650 --> 01:24:08.330]
Like I said, the audience is really turning on to this 282 votes.

[01:24:08.790 --> 01:24:09.770]
Nicholas Shays got none.

[01:24:10.050 --> 01:24:10.890]
I should have voted for Nick.

[01:24:11.090 --> 01:24:12.570]
He sure is a hell of a lot hotter than Brad Pitt.

[01:24:14.530 --> 01:24:15.770]
Well, what do you give me a look like that?

[01:24:15.930 --> 01:24:16.490]
What do you like?

[01:24:17.010 --> 01:24:18.510]
You see, you don't understand what that means.

[01:24:18.990 --> 01:24:19.830]
You don't understand it.

[01:24:19.830 --> 01:24:23.590]
Just because he's face, he's got a proboscis, he's hot.

[01:24:23.810 --> 01:24:25.010]
Do you understand? Have you ever seen him naked?

[01:24:25.270 --> 01:24:26.410]
I have. Close to it.

[01:24:27.310 --> 01:24:30.090]
Very close to it. Not close enough, but...

[01:24:30.090 --> 01:24:31.490]
Tyra Banks don't have any.

[01:24:31.670 --> 01:24:33.150]
And the Christine Aguilarie don't have any.

[01:24:33.230 --> 01:24:34.290]
Oh, thank God.

[01:24:35.270 --> 01:24:37.390]
That restores my faith a little bit in the human race.

[01:24:37.670 --> 01:24:38.270]
Oh, I see her.

[01:24:38.430 --> 01:24:39.030]
Oh, geez.

[01:24:39.250 --> 01:24:40.490]
Put out the cheese, please.

[01:24:40.910 --> 01:24:41.350]
Geez, Louise.

[01:24:42.750 --> 01:24:43.510]
Christine Aguilarra.

[01:24:43.810 --> 01:24:45.450]
Don't get sucked in by the hype, okay?

[01:24:45.670 --> 01:24:46.910]
It's one thing that gets sucked in.

[01:24:47.350 --> 01:24:49.090]
But don't get sucked in by the hype.

[01:24:49.850 --> 01:24:51.730]
It's Angie Harmon. People want me to tell you.

[01:24:51.810 --> 01:24:55.510]
Well, his handwriting looks like he's been doing acid with Dick Feinberg.

[01:24:55.850 --> 01:24:57.150]
He must have gotten the same shipment.

[01:24:57.810 --> 01:24:59.210]
So we're putting that on her, Angie Harmon.

[01:25:02.050 --> 01:25:02.770]
Jason Seahorn.

[01:25:02.950 --> 01:25:03.830]
What's it? Well, who's he?

[01:25:04.210 --> 01:25:06.750]
He's a football player or basketball player.

[01:25:06.830 --> 01:25:07.310]
Jaiyats, he says.

[01:25:07.710 --> 01:25:09.450]
Oh, that's right. Jason Seahorn plays with the giant.

[01:25:09.630 --> 01:25:10.150]
What do I know?

[01:25:10.230 --> 01:25:11.310]
I told you an other thing about sports.

[01:25:12.210 --> 01:25:12.690]
Angie what?

[01:25:13.510 --> 01:25:13.870]
Harmon.

[01:25:17.150 --> 01:25:18.170]
Okay, let me give it a listen.

[01:25:18.350 --> 01:25:21.730]
We got so far because we got a lot of people doing image stream because they didn't realize

[01:25:21.730 --> 01:25:23.190]
Goldie was on by himself this morning.

[01:25:23.810 --> 01:25:29.150]
Who is the hottest person, public figure, not your wife, not your boyfriend, your girlfriend, your sister-in-law?

[01:25:29.310 --> 01:25:30.430]
We're talking about public figures.

[01:25:30.590 --> 01:25:32.610]
Somebody's celebrity, somebody's a lot of jock, somebody like that.

[01:25:33.430 --> 01:25:33.850]
In the world.

[01:25:34.750 --> 01:25:36.210]
How come Janet Reno ain't honey here yet?

[01:25:36.810 --> 01:25:39.490]
Britney Spears, Hallie Berry, Brad Pitt.

[01:25:40.050 --> 01:25:42.770]
You think they really had something going, Janet Reno and Sister Jean?

[01:25:43.850 --> 01:25:45.190]
I haven't played that in so long.

[01:25:45.190 --> 01:25:46.150]
I've got to play that today.

[01:25:46.290 --> 01:25:47.550]
Don't let me forget Sister Jean, please.

[01:25:47.770 --> 01:25:48.510]
It must be played.

[01:25:49.210 --> 01:25:50.210]
Did you see the picture of Britney?

[01:25:50.930 --> 01:25:51.410]
No, Angie.

[01:25:52.750 --> 01:25:53.070]
Harmon.

[01:25:53.430 --> 01:25:57.190]
And the look you gave me was like, eh, compared to some of the other people on the list.

[01:25:57.630 --> 01:25:58.430]
So what you're saying, no?

[01:25:58.890 --> 01:26:00.010]
They both say crosser out.

[01:26:00.050 --> 01:26:01.050]
Okay, crosser out, Eric.

[01:26:01.730 --> 01:26:03.350]
Knock Angie right off that list right now.

[01:26:03.450 --> 01:26:05.290]
If I get Jason Seahorn, I think it's pretty her and she is.

[01:26:05.870 --> 01:26:06.910]
He's not a bad looking guy.

[01:26:07.990 --> 01:26:10.750]
Britney Spears, Hallie Berry, Brad Pitt, Jaiylo, Tom Welling.

[01:26:12.510 --> 01:26:13.230]
Tom Brady.

[01:26:13.770 --> 01:26:16.230]
Remember Tom Brady won a Super Bowl of the Patriots last year?

[01:26:16.310 --> 01:26:17.070]
Oh, God.

[01:26:17.510 --> 01:26:18.430]
No, that wasn't what I wanted.

[01:26:18.430 --> 01:26:24.510]
What we wanted was, uh, Anna Kwanakova, Carmen Electra, which George thinks he's not too hot.

[01:26:24.630 --> 01:26:25.470]
The worm has been there.

[01:26:26.570 --> 01:26:27.670]
I wouldn't be surprised.

[01:26:28.030 --> 01:26:29.350]
Well, the worm's been all over on Saturday.

[01:26:29.590 --> 01:26:30.610]
In fact, the worm is still around.

[01:26:30.670 --> 01:26:31.790]
It's one of the stories on our website.

[01:26:32.670 --> 01:26:33.610]
Beware of the worm.

[01:26:34.770 --> 01:26:38.230]
Elizabeth Hurley, Sharon Stone, the little old but nevertheless, she's doing okay.

[01:26:38.510 --> 01:26:39.270]
She's holding her own.

[01:26:39.270 --> 01:26:43.250]
Carmen Diaz, Penelope Cruz, which George is violent about that.

[01:26:43.610 --> 01:26:45.490]
Jessica Simpson, you ought to be pleased she's on air.

[01:26:45.930 --> 01:26:46.050]
Eh.

[01:26:49.670 --> 01:26:51.790]
Well, you sure turned fast, I'll tell you.

[01:26:52.090 --> 01:26:55.210]
You never thought she was spectacular and hot and everything like she's just fine.

[01:26:55.390 --> 01:26:58.690]
You said she looked great in person that she was a lot better looking than her pictures,

[01:26:59.030 --> 01:27:00.810]
and that you would have done her right here on the tabletop.

[01:27:01.390 --> 01:27:01.610]
Yeah.

[01:27:01.990 --> 01:27:07.630]
Oh, Shania Twain, Catherine Zeta Jones, who's married to Michael Douglas, who thinks he's a real sex pot.

[01:27:07.630 --> 01:27:08.630]
I'm going to tell you something.

[01:27:08.990 --> 01:27:10.930]
I've had Bob movements that are sexier than he is.

[01:27:11.350 --> 01:27:13.330]
He is not sexy in the least bit.

[01:27:13.730 --> 01:27:15.650]
And you know what, when he was younger, never was then either.

[01:27:16.390 --> 01:27:18.190]
They showed his ass in one of the movies.

[01:27:18.290 --> 01:27:18.910]
Oh, no!

[01:27:19.130 --> 01:27:19.990]
It's all flapping.

[01:27:20.230 --> 01:27:20.470]
Oh!

[01:27:20.870 --> 01:27:22.730]
It's the meat gut suck out of it.

[01:27:22.730 --> 01:27:23.910]
Oh, no!

[01:27:24.370 --> 01:27:25.110]
Flaping in the wind.

[01:27:25.330 --> 01:27:27.550]
Well, if anybody sucked, I don't want to go into it.

[01:27:28.110 --> 01:27:30.430]
No, but you're the one responsible for that if that happened.

[01:27:30.670 --> 01:27:31.730]
I don't want to repeat what you said.

[01:27:32.530 --> 01:27:33.450]
And Rique Grisius.

[01:27:34.130 --> 01:27:35.130]
Does he have any votes in Rique?

[01:27:35.470 --> 01:27:37.070]
How about Antonio Sabato, Jr.?

[01:27:37.070 --> 01:27:37.870]
He doesn't need the moment of lazy.

[01:27:37.970 --> 01:27:39.730]
I get him confused with Antonio Banderas.

[01:27:40.510 --> 01:27:42.490]
But I'm sure Antonio Sabato, Jr. is the moment of lazy.

[01:27:42.630 --> 01:27:43.290]
He's a good looking guy.

[01:27:44.130 --> 01:27:44.730]
He's got a vote.

[01:27:46.390 --> 01:27:47.510]
Lived Tyler's only got one.

[01:27:47.630 --> 01:27:49.570]
That's because they don't like Eros Smith.

[01:27:49.710 --> 01:27:50.730]
What is wrong with you people?

[01:27:51.270 --> 01:27:53.950]
They're into dead people like Kurt Cobain.

[01:27:54.690 --> 01:27:55.170]
Nicholas Shade.

[01:27:55.390 --> 01:27:56.750]
Does he have any, my good buddy, Nick?

[01:27:57.050 --> 01:27:58.710]
How about he doesn't have any right there in the bottom, huh?

[01:27:59.450 --> 01:27:59.550]
No.

[01:28:01.090 --> 01:28:02.890]
Christian Croc, does Christian Croc have one?

[01:28:03.830 --> 01:28:04.770]
Maybe she does have one.

[01:28:04.790 --> 01:28:06.470]
That's why he don't want anything to do with her.

[01:28:07.110 --> 01:28:08.910]
Christian Croc, do you see any votes for Christian?

[01:28:10.010 --> 01:28:10.930]
Small Vellia, too.

[01:28:11.050 --> 01:28:11.550]
She's got a pair.

[01:28:12.590 --> 01:28:13.930]
Clarkson ain't nothing to write home about.

[01:28:14.790 --> 01:28:19.450]
Heather Locklear, Tyler Banks, Charlize Theron, Jennifer Garner, Jackie Johnson, Channel 7,

[01:28:19.450 --> 01:28:20.010]
No, Weather.

[01:28:21.350 --> 01:28:22.570]
She's spreading over that map.

[01:28:23.010 --> 01:28:23.810]
Christine Aguilera.

[01:28:26.230 --> 01:28:31.270]
By the way, when you think of it, tomorrow, we throw the show and you do all that very hard work in there before the show.

[01:28:31.590 --> 01:28:32.830]
What we need is just by itself.

[01:28:33.050 --> 01:28:33.590]
Oh, I know.

[01:28:33.590 --> 01:28:36.390]
So I don't have to go through all of this that, like I just did.

[01:28:37.310 --> 01:28:38.610]
Because that comes in handy.

[01:28:38.770 --> 01:28:40.690]
Especially when we're talking about Christine Aguilera.

[01:28:40.770 --> 01:28:41.270]
Oh, I know.

[01:28:41.470 --> 01:28:42.870]
See, and now it just comes out automatic.

[01:28:43.130 --> 01:28:43.930]
You just mentioned her name.

[01:28:44.790 --> 01:28:48.070]
Liv Tyler, Jennifer Conlay, Johnny Depp, who's prettier than a lot of these people.

[01:28:49.350 --> 01:28:50.070]
Lucy Liu.

[01:28:50.350 --> 01:28:50.890]
Lucy Liu.

[01:28:51.590 --> 01:28:53.190]
Is she kind of like Lucy Goosey, too?

[01:28:54.150 --> 01:28:54.710]
I'll check.

[01:28:55.410 --> 01:28:56.290]
I'll get back to you.

[01:28:56.330 --> 01:28:57.090]
Wouldn't surprise me.

[01:28:57.550 --> 01:29:01.010]
It's 1042, but a lot of these people on this list are Lucy Goosey by now.

[01:29:01.450 --> 01:29:03.210]
1042 at 560 WQM.

[01:29:03.310 --> 01:29:07.650]
I can't believe that all the time has gone by so fast and Brandy's this year celebrating their 2050 year in business.

[01:29:08.090 --> 01:29:09.670]
They've been around almost as long as I have.

[01:29:10.110 --> 01:29:14.570]
Any independent family schooster that's been around nearly a quarter of a century has got to be doing a lot of things right.

[01:29:14.930 --> 01:29:22.530]
Like offering an unbeatable select of men's and women's famous brand names like Rockports, Echoes, Mephisto, Timberland Clarks, SAS, Floreshymes, and all the other top names.

[01:29:22.910 --> 01:29:25.130]
And the wide range of sizes at Brandy's is unbeatable.

[01:29:25.210 --> 01:29:26.330]
Men's size 6 to 15.

[01:29:26.330 --> 01:29:28.010]
They can even fit Tom Welling.

[01:29:28.350 --> 01:29:30.750]
Women's 5 to 12 and women's from the very narrow to the very wide.

[01:29:31.150 --> 01:29:33.670]
And don't forget their professional sales staff that will help you choose the right styles.

[01:29:34.050 --> 01:29:36.010]
And then sit you down and fit those shoes with your individual feet.

[01:29:36.150 --> 01:29:37.990]
That's what we call service around these parts.

[01:29:38.370 --> 01:29:45.430]
With over 40,000 pairs in stock and their 8,000 square foot megastore can be damn sure that the exact kind of style you're looking for is in stock.

[01:29:45.530 --> 01:29:47.970]
We're going to pop up on your shoes, on your feet, on your thing.

[01:29:48.310 --> 01:29:51.910]
So when you need shoes, get into Brandy's shoes where there's always a sale or special sales promotion.

[01:29:52.310 --> 01:29:54.010]
Brandy's a great, great place to shop for shoes.

[01:29:54.010 --> 01:29:56.010]
You'll find them at 1290 North Federal Highway.

[01:29:56.150 --> 01:29:57.830]
And the good news is you won't fight a roll of shoe man there.

[01:29:57.950 --> 01:30:01.110]
Thank goodness. They're in Pompano Beach open daily 9 to 9 Sundays 10 to 5.

[01:30:01.250 --> 01:30:04.510]
All this wicked Brandy shoes take 10 bucks off an A shoes priced over 50 bucks.

[01:30:04.630 --> 01:30:09.070]
This offer's got an every famous brand in the store with the exception of SAS shoes going on right now.

[01:30:09.070 --> 01:30:13.090]
This wicked Brandy's in Pompano Beach. See that's what I tell you.

[01:30:14.110 --> 01:30:17.070]
That's the Christian here. We're rolling along and all of a sudden.

[01:30:17.250 --> 01:30:19.970]
See what's just happening? Let's try that one more time.

[01:30:20.750 --> 01:30:21.790]
In fact, win a minute.

[01:30:23.210 --> 01:30:24.310]
Aight, Snorke!

[01:30:24.330 --> 01:30:24.570]
See?

[01:30:26.270 --> 01:30:27.390]
And then you do.

[01:30:27.890 --> 01:30:32.210]
There I am, local. We're Sports Radio 560, ceiling.

[01:30:32.670 --> 01:30:33.390]
We're ZOM.

[01:30:35.210 --> 01:30:36.810]
And I am a pussy.

[01:30:38.590 --> 01:30:40.990]
It's the most talked about video the year.

[01:30:41.410 --> 01:30:43.630]
Roblo direct stars and performs in.

[01:30:43.810 --> 01:30:45.110]
No, no.

[01:30:45.630 --> 01:30:46.830]
The critics are raving.

[01:30:47.270 --> 01:30:48.670]
Jesus will says it blows.

[01:30:48.670 --> 01:30:50.510]
Roger Ebert says it sucks.

[01:30:50.730 --> 01:30:52.230]
Mary Hart says it was hard to swallow.

[01:30:52.590 --> 01:30:55.290]
Roman Polanski says what's the big deal? Mine was 13.

[01:30:55.610 --> 01:30:57.270]
You after says this one's loaded.

[01:30:57.610 --> 01:30:58.410]
With entertainment.

[01:30:58.830 --> 01:31:01.390]
Jean Shalott says this one fires no blanks.

[01:31:01.390 --> 01:31:02.650]
No, no.

[01:31:03.250 --> 01:31:05.870]
Roblo filmed in sensual round in spread of vision.

[01:31:06.110 --> 01:31:07.550]
No, no.

[01:31:07.950 --> 01:31:08.890]
Roblo is coming.

[01:31:09.150 --> 01:31:12.350]
In your living room with a spasmodic release of his directorial debut.

[01:31:12.710 --> 01:31:13.950]
No, no.

[01:31:14.610 --> 01:31:15.610]
Written PG-13.

[01:31:15.990 --> 01:31:16.650]
It's mid-16.

[01:31:18.190 --> 01:31:20.490]
If you blow too much, you're in trouble.

[01:31:20.650 --> 01:31:21.930]
10.475.60.

[01:31:22.090 --> 01:31:25.370]
So guess who was on biography on what was biography was on MSNBC.

[01:31:25.690 --> 01:31:27.150]
Whatever they call their biography things.

[01:31:27.390 --> 01:31:28.310]
Guess who was on that Sunday.

[01:31:29.250 --> 01:31:29.610]
Roblo.

[01:31:29.790 --> 01:31:30.250]
Good guess.

[01:31:31.090 --> 01:31:31.830]
How'd you get that?

[01:31:32.410 --> 01:31:32.770]
Psychic.

[01:31:33.250 --> 01:31:34.030]
I'll tell you one thing.

[01:31:34.110 --> 01:31:34.890]
He sure was pretty.

[01:31:35.090 --> 01:31:36.290]
And I emphasize the was part.

[01:31:36.610 --> 01:31:37.530]
Like girly pretty.

[01:31:37.770 --> 01:31:38.650]
Yeah, exactly.

[01:31:38.930 --> 01:31:39.510]
In fact, he sure did.

[01:31:39.590 --> 01:31:40.530]
He was like his high school picture.

[01:31:40.850 --> 01:31:43.590]
And of course he had the hair that was real popping in the 70s.

[01:31:43.670 --> 01:31:43.750]
Yeah.

[01:31:44.330 --> 01:31:45.310]
He looked like a girl.

[01:31:45.310 --> 01:31:47.350]
He looked like David Cassidy-ish.

[01:31:48.030 --> 01:31:48.810]
That's a good full question.

[01:31:48.830 --> 01:31:49.370]
New ad better here.

[01:31:49.490 --> 01:31:50.990]
Susan Day, David Cassidy, you're Roblo.

[01:31:52.690 --> 01:31:54.430]
And I don't care what anybody said.

[01:31:54.530 --> 01:31:55.190]
I don't want to go into it.

[01:31:55.290 --> 01:31:55.910]
But you know what I'm saying.

[01:31:56.210 --> 01:31:56.570]
What do you say?

[01:31:56.970 --> 01:31:57.870]
He's married with kids.

[01:31:58.570 --> 01:32:01.570]
I don't care what anybody tells me about her.

[01:32:02.270 --> 01:32:02.490]
Roblo.

[01:32:03.370 --> 01:32:04.850]
But he's not looking too good anymore.

[01:32:04.970 --> 01:32:05.930]
You want to know why he's getting old.

[01:32:06.850 --> 01:32:07.430]
He's getting old.

[01:32:07.990 --> 01:32:08.950]
Yeah, we're all getting old.

[01:32:09.010 --> 01:32:09.590]
We don't look so good.

[01:32:09.710 --> 01:32:11.270]
In fact, some of us never looked too good.

[01:32:13.310 --> 01:32:14.730]
I'm not looking at Carlos necessary.

[01:32:15.270 --> 01:32:18.090]
I never looked too much different when I looked like now,

[01:32:18.090 --> 01:32:19.070]
which is really scary.

[01:32:19.670 --> 01:32:21.650]
When I was like 10, I looked like I do now.

[01:32:21.910 --> 01:32:23.110]
Although I do need a haircut real bad.

[01:32:23.250 --> 01:32:23.830]
That's okay.

[01:32:24.790 --> 01:32:25.990]
Tomorrow I've got to go get a haircut.

[01:32:26.770 --> 01:32:27.630]
But not at that place.

[01:32:27.810 --> 01:32:28.610]
Now I'm going to that place.

[01:32:28.790 --> 01:32:28.790]

[01:32:29.230 --> 01:32:30.490]
Because I like the one barber there.

[01:32:30.590 --> 01:32:31.770]
I don't care if the other guy's an asshole.

[01:32:31.890 --> 01:32:33.330]
You know what I'm going to walk to walk and say,

[01:32:33.430 --> 01:32:34.290]
give me the built-clinton haircut.

[01:32:34.610 --> 01:32:37.010]
Yeah, tip the barber directly and then just give the other guy a haircut.

[01:32:37.010 --> 01:32:37.270]
A cigar.

[01:32:38.070 --> 01:32:38.930]
Give the other guy a cigar.

[01:32:39.330 --> 01:32:39.790]
I used one.

[01:32:40.150 --> 01:32:40.370]
Yeah.

[01:32:40.790 --> 01:32:41.930]
A soiled one from my...

[01:32:41.930 --> 01:32:42.270]
Rectum.

[01:32:42.650 --> 01:32:44.410]
Oscar de la Hoya somebody says.

[01:32:44.590 --> 01:32:45.650]
He's a pretty good looking guy.

[01:32:45.750 --> 01:32:46.090]
What do you say?

[01:32:46.210 --> 01:32:47.130]
I don't know what he looks like.

[01:32:47.330 --> 01:32:47.650]
Boxer.

[01:32:48.050 --> 01:32:48.930]
I don't know who he is.

[01:32:49.010 --> 01:32:49.870]
I just don't know what he looks like.

[01:32:50.150 --> 01:32:50.770]
Oscar de la...

[01:32:50.770 --> 01:32:51.350]
Oh, yeah.

[01:32:51.910 --> 01:32:52.650]
He's not going on.

[01:32:53.170 --> 01:32:54.830]
Here's some pictures of Antonio Sabato,

[01:32:54.850 --> 01:32:55.090]
Jr.

[01:32:55.290 --> 01:32:56.270]
He used to look a lot better than any other.

[01:32:56.270 --> 01:32:57.110]
He does have a lazy eye.

[01:32:57.610 --> 01:32:59.010]
Oh, he looks nasty now.

[01:32:59.870 --> 01:33:02.410]
He replaced Mark Wahlberg as the Calvin Klein underwear boy.

[01:33:02.590 --> 01:33:05.950]
He played Jack Jagger Cates on General Hospital for two years.

[01:33:06.770 --> 01:33:07.550]
I didn't know that.

[01:33:07.910 --> 01:33:08.410]
Well, I tell you what,

[01:33:08.490 --> 01:33:09.270]
in General Hospital,

[01:33:09.430 --> 01:33:11.310]
she had a lot of good looking studs on there.

[01:33:12.130 --> 01:33:12.810]
Richard Simmons.

[01:33:13.590 --> 01:33:14.390]
I mean, no.

[01:33:15.130 --> 01:33:16.510]
Blacky, what else is named Blacky?

[01:33:17.310 --> 01:33:17.890]
John Stamos.

[01:33:18.130 --> 01:33:20.070]
Yes, you do know John Stamos.

[01:33:20.070 --> 01:33:20.990]
Oh, no, it's called Housel.

[01:33:21.090 --> 01:33:21.650]
Yeah, but the House.

[01:33:21.870 --> 01:33:22.590]
Not General Housel.

[01:33:23.010 --> 01:33:23.070]
Yeah.

[01:33:23.650 --> 01:33:24.510]
Who else was on there?

[01:33:24.630 --> 01:33:25.590]
Rick Springfield was on there?

[01:33:26.510 --> 01:33:26.810]
Really?

[01:33:27.590 --> 01:33:28.350]
And he was in a set.

[01:33:28.350 --> 01:33:28.790]
What is that?

[01:33:29.390 --> 01:33:29.730]
What is that?

[01:33:29.790 --> 01:33:30.570]
What kind of a look is that?

[01:33:31.390 --> 01:33:31.970]
Rick Springfield.

[01:33:32.230 --> 01:33:33.970]
Rick, I think about his music.

[01:33:34.550 --> 01:33:35.510]
When you say Rick Springfield,

[01:33:35.590 --> 01:33:36.350]
I think about his music.

[01:33:38.950 --> 01:33:40.950]
What would you expect me to think about his face?

[01:33:40.950 --> 01:33:44.790]
That great sci-fi show he was in for about five minutes.

[01:33:44.950 --> 01:33:46.110]
They killed him off on the first episode,

[01:33:46.110 --> 01:33:47.150]
which is a bad mistake.

[01:33:48.070 --> 01:33:49.290]
Battlestar Galifika wasn't at the one.

[01:33:49.390 --> 01:33:49.870]
That's very good.

[01:33:49.890 --> 01:33:50.670]
Lauren Green.

[01:33:50.810 --> 01:33:51.350]
And now he's dead.

[01:33:51.490 --> 01:33:54.570]
That'll teach him to kill off Rick Springfield in the first episode.

[01:33:55.030 --> 01:33:57.990]
Back in those days, Rick Springfield looked like a fine American.

[01:33:58.250 --> 01:33:58.490]
Okay.

[01:33:58.890 --> 01:34:00.570]
You don't think he was ex sucked, huh?

[01:34:03.210 --> 01:34:04.730]
How could you possibly say that?

[01:34:05.190 --> 01:34:06.050]
Even though it's true.

[01:34:07.710 --> 01:34:08.090]
Let's see.

[01:34:08.090 --> 01:34:09.530]
He also starred in Steven Spielberg,

[01:34:09.670 --> 01:34:11.250]
short-lived TV series called Earth 2.

[01:34:12.570 --> 01:34:14.830]
He also guest starred in six episodes of Mel Road Place.

[01:34:14.970 --> 01:34:16.350]
And once he played Header Locked Beer's husband,

[01:34:16.770 --> 01:34:19.590]
he has a, oh, what about the guy speaking of guys that Mel Road Place?

[01:34:20.010 --> 01:34:20.710]
What was that guy?

[01:34:22.010 --> 01:34:22.610]
Oh, that guy.

[01:34:23.070 --> 01:34:24.610]
No, there was a guy Mel Road Place,

[01:34:24.910 --> 01:34:26.810]
who was, what the hell was his name?

[01:34:26.970 --> 01:34:28.130]
He probably don't look good to do it anymore.

[01:34:28.230 --> 01:34:29.030]
That's a long time ago.

[01:34:30.110 --> 01:34:33.390]
That's like saying Pat Peterson from Notzlantic.

[01:34:33.730 --> 01:34:34.710]
Can I almost say LA Law?

[01:34:35.190 --> 01:34:35.550]
Notzlantic.

[01:34:35.630 --> 01:34:36.190]
14-slit.

[01:34:37.010 --> 01:34:38.170]
I never saw Mel Road Place.

[01:34:40.010 --> 01:34:41.350]
I don't think I ever watched it either,

[01:34:41.450 --> 01:34:44.150]
but like in some of these shows where they go back and show clips, you know,

[01:34:44.230 --> 01:34:46.250]
like in Header Locked Beer's bio, things like that.

[01:34:47.430 --> 01:34:49.890]
There was a, somebody will know, somebody will fast,

[01:34:49.990 --> 01:34:52.010]
is, if that Rachel, the Brunette, the Miller Light commercial,

[01:34:53.770 --> 01:34:55.050]
nobody knows who that is.

[01:34:55.970 --> 01:34:57.090]
R-A-C-A-T-L.

[01:34:57.190 --> 01:35:00.070]
Rachel, if that, Rachel, I don't know who that is.

[01:35:00.530 --> 01:35:01.930]
It's a George Checkouter website.

[01:35:02.270 --> 01:35:03.410]
So I'll put this off to the side.

[01:35:03.410 --> 01:35:07.490]
R-A-C-H-E-L-E-V-E-E-Y-E-T-T-Like Corvette.

[01:35:08.550 --> 01:35:09.450]
Here's one, look at this.

[01:35:09.590 --> 01:35:10.250]
It says Ginger.

[01:35:10.430 --> 01:35:12.190]
My suggestion for your pull is Catherine Hepburn.

[01:35:12.530 --> 01:35:15.790]
When I look at her all I can say is it's time to get it on, sign H. David.

[01:35:18.090 --> 01:35:18.810]
That's kind of cute.

[01:35:18.910 --> 01:35:20.150]
Let me tell you who's sick and needs help.

[01:35:20.290 --> 01:35:23.370]
And now I just want to club with a baseball bat.

[01:35:24.430 --> 01:35:25.810]
Let me give you one guess, okay?

[01:35:26.770 --> 01:35:27.650]
His ex-nabour?

[01:35:28.870 --> 01:35:29.230]
Yeah.

[01:35:29.690 --> 01:35:30.050]
David?

[01:35:30.350 --> 01:35:30.630]
Yeah.

[01:35:30.830 --> 01:35:31.790]
I want to tell you something, David.

[01:35:31.790 --> 01:35:34.370]
I don't want to play Butch Boss here on the radio, but you're getting on my nerves.

[01:35:34.370 --> 01:35:38.730]
The problem with David is, once in a great while, out of every 100 facts is one of his pretty good.

[01:35:39.470 --> 01:35:40.130]
Worth a while.

[01:35:40.190 --> 01:35:41.290]
Like in Stereoports on High Bulls.

[01:35:41.290 --> 01:35:42.230]
Something that we can use.

[01:35:42.710 --> 01:35:43.030]
Whatever.

[01:35:43.770 --> 01:35:48.850]
But the other 99, which he would just as well save time and all his energy, here's I vote for Errol Flynn.

[01:35:50.110 --> 01:35:52.110]
A lot of rumors about Errol Flynn, by the way.

[01:35:52.230 --> 01:35:54.650]
And those books that Holly would vote for the most in the name of that series of books.

[01:35:55.330 --> 01:35:56.550]
Holly would babble on.

[01:35:56.730 --> 01:35:57.050]
Oh yeah.

[01:35:57.470 --> 01:35:58.850]
That's where we get paid to do it here, folks.

[01:35:59.110 --> 01:35:59.490]
Babble on?

[01:36:00.150 --> 01:36:03.370]
He's supposed to have been doing it with everybody from what I hear.

[01:36:03.510 --> 01:36:03.690]
Errol Flynn?

[01:36:03.930 --> 01:36:03.990]
Yeah.

[01:36:04.250 --> 01:36:04.830]
And Kerry Grant.

[01:36:05.530 --> 01:36:07.010]
And Sir Lawrence Olivia and Danny K.

[01:36:07.250 --> 01:36:07.410]
Oh, Lawrence.

[01:36:07.830 --> 01:36:08.130]
Yeah.

[01:36:08.610 --> 01:36:09.110]
And Danny K.

[01:36:09.290 --> 01:36:10.130]
What's his name is Lawrence?

[01:36:10.610 --> 01:36:11.510]
Olivia and Danny K.

[01:36:12.430 --> 01:36:12.830]
Yeah.

[01:36:13.170 --> 01:36:13.650]
And you know what?

[01:36:14.450 --> 01:36:15.130]
And you know what?

[01:36:15.210 --> 01:36:16.330]
Both of those things rhyme with.

[01:36:16.530 --> 01:36:16.690]
Yeah.

[01:36:16.950 --> 01:36:17.070]
Yeah.

[01:36:17.670 --> 01:36:18.590]
I knew you'd know it.

[01:36:20.390 --> 01:36:24.350]
56670560, pound 560 on the AT&T Inforizon Wireless Line.

[01:36:24.770 --> 01:36:25.370]
Leah Romini.

[01:36:26.450 --> 01:36:27.750]
Who's Leah Romini, huh?

[01:36:28.530 --> 01:36:28.770]
Who?

[01:36:29.770 --> 01:36:30.410]
Leah Romini.

[01:36:30.730 --> 01:36:31.530]
Oh, Leah Romini.

[01:36:31.970 --> 01:36:33.270]
Well, what do I know about that?

[01:36:33.390 --> 01:36:33.530]
Remini.

[01:36:34.070 --> 01:36:36.550]
I don't want to know what she's on.

[01:36:36.630 --> 01:36:37.090]
Is she any good?

[01:36:37.230 --> 01:36:37.570]
She hot?

[01:36:37.810 --> 01:36:38.290]
Would you do her?

[01:36:38.670 --> 01:36:39.350]
Yeah, I do her.

[01:36:39.570 --> 01:36:41.510]
Well, you would do anybody at this point of your life.

[01:36:41.650 --> 01:36:42.690]
That's not the answer to the question.

[01:36:42.810 --> 01:36:44.570]
Is she really smoldering?

[01:36:45.030 --> 01:36:46.170]
You mean you wouldn't do Doreen?

[01:36:49.430 --> 01:36:50.070]
Leah Romini.

[01:36:50.310 --> 01:36:50.830]
Yes or no?

[01:36:51.110 --> 01:36:51.150]
Yes.

[01:36:51.150 --> 01:36:52.290]
Thumbs up or thumbs down?

[01:36:52.630 --> 01:36:52.850]
Okay.

[01:36:52.990 --> 01:36:53.530]
Leah Romini.

[01:36:53.750 --> 01:36:55.330]
R-E-M-I-N-I.

[01:36:56.110 --> 01:36:57.330]
Looks like Remini to me.

[01:36:57.330 --> 01:36:57.390]
Remini.

[01:36:58.350 --> 01:36:58.670]
Remini.

[01:37:01.690 --> 01:37:02.330]
Jolene Blalock.

[01:37:03.630 --> 01:37:05.550]
Didn't we have a salesperson named Jim Remini?

[01:37:05.730 --> 01:37:06.590]
What station was that on?

[01:37:06.930 --> 01:37:07.950]
Was that an old WS News?

[01:37:08.070 --> 01:37:09.230]
We had a sales guy with IOD.

[01:37:09.670 --> 01:37:10.190]
I would do that.

[01:37:10.250 --> 01:37:10.630]
He had a Jim Remini.

[01:37:10.850 --> 01:37:11.630]
He had a UV-L-U.

[01:37:11.630 --> 01:37:12.170]
He had what?

[01:37:13.630 --> 01:37:14.970]
He had a sleep avenue problem,

[01:37:14.970 --> 01:37:16.830]
so they surgically removed his UV-L-U.

[01:37:16.870 --> 01:37:17.150]
Really?

[01:37:17.390 --> 01:37:18.070]
His little flapper?

[01:37:18.250 --> 01:37:18.550]
So he would say...

[01:37:18.550 --> 01:37:19.990]
What that's bad when they take out your flapper?

[01:37:20.290 --> 01:37:21.390]
I have no UV-L-U.

[01:37:21.390 --> 01:37:22.250]
Oh, yeah, I remember him.

[01:37:22.590 --> 01:37:23.270]
He was a nerd.

[01:37:23.610 --> 01:37:24.430]
He lost a lot of weight.

[01:37:24.830 --> 01:37:26.090]
Remember, he started out as fat.

[01:37:26.090 --> 01:37:27.370]
If he walked in here...

[01:37:27.370 --> 01:37:28.330]
Oh, yeah, he had glasses.

[01:37:28.330 --> 01:37:29.610]
He was a nerd-y guy.

[01:37:29.990 --> 01:37:30.770]
He was a nerdy guy.

[01:37:30.770 --> 01:37:31.270]
He was a nerdy guy.

[01:37:31.390 --> 01:37:32.530]
Why is that most salespeople?

[01:37:32.810 --> 01:37:33.370]
Those are nerdy guys.

[01:37:33.910 --> 01:37:34.310]
G-Y.

[01:37:34.870 --> 01:37:35.270]
I don't know.

[01:37:35.490 --> 01:37:35.890]
Why is that?

[01:37:36.430 --> 01:37:36.930]
Look at here.

[01:37:37.350 --> 01:37:37.890]
Look at ourselves.

[01:37:38.250 --> 01:37:39.090]
Oh, that's nerd.

[01:37:39.790 --> 01:37:39.910]
Nerd.

[01:37:40.610 --> 01:37:41.330]
PD Lenny.

[01:37:41.670 --> 01:37:42.410]
Total nerd geek.

[01:37:43.690 --> 01:37:44.350]
Fat boy.

[01:37:44.510 --> 01:37:45.090]
Beyond nerd.

[01:37:45.290 --> 01:37:46.890]
You know, whatever is 10 stages beyond.

[01:37:47.050 --> 01:37:47.670]
Thought choice, right?

[01:37:47.850 --> 01:37:48.510]
Thought choice, right?

[01:37:48.510 --> 01:37:48.550]
Thought choice, right?

[01:37:48.690 --> 01:37:49.770]
Thought he had a geek nerd.

[01:37:50.050 --> 01:37:50.430]
Thought a nerd.

[01:37:50.650 --> 01:37:51.610]
He is so...

[01:37:51.610 --> 01:37:52.650]
You have to wear that tie.

[01:37:52.830 --> 01:37:53.390]
Now, he's a good guy.

[01:37:53.390 --> 01:37:54.750]
I like to try a lot.

[01:37:55.250 --> 01:37:56.410]
Although I tell you one thing,

[01:37:56.470 --> 01:37:57.510]
good thing for you dolphin fans.

[01:37:57.510 --> 01:37:58.230]
They got Ricky Williams.

[01:37:58.230 --> 01:38:00.230]
Because that bogus running game, you know?

[01:38:00.770 --> 01:38:02.030]
Mark Higgs and Tristrad.

[01:38:02.170 --> 01:38:03.290]
All those make believe running backs.

[01:38:03.290 --> 01:38:04.030]
They used to have...

[01:38:04.030 --> 01:38:05.150]
Troys a good guy over here, man.

[01:38:05.250 --> 01:38:05.770]
With his bald head.

[01:38:05.890 --> 01:38:07.370]
But could he run with that bald or what?

[01:38:07.410 --> 01:38:07.570]
No.

[01:38:08.490 --> 01:38:09.930]
Now, as my grandma would say,

[01:38:10.050 --> 01:38:11.090]
F-meer-er running back.

[01:38:11.890 --> 01:38:13.390]
Now, what about your lean-play lock?

[01:38:13.390 --> 01:38:13.770]
Who is she?

[01:38:13.950 --> 01:38:13.950]

[01:38:14.870 --> 01:38:16.030]
What was her quick guess?

[01:38:16.250 --> 01:38:16.250]

[01:38:16.250 --> 01:38:17.750]
Also, she did a maximum...

[01:38:19.270 --> 01:38:19.630]
...pictorial.

[01:38:21.090 --> 01:38:21.830]
She's very hot.

[01:38:22.330 --> 01:38:22.730]
I see.

[01:38:23.270 --> 01:38:24.010]
Here's the update.

[01:38:24.010 --> 01:38:25.210]
The hottest person in the world.

[01:38:25.330 --> 01:38:26.510]
Not the hottest 600 people.

[01:38:26.670 --> 01:38:28.370]
Not the most mediocre look-worm people.

[01:38:28.450 --> 01:38:30.590]
You like to take a guy to a big bath and like Erie with.

[01:38:31.670 --> 01:38:34.350]
No, we're talking about the hottest person that is your wildest fantasy.

[01:38:34.710 --> 01:38:36.030]
That just to see them there on the screen.

[01:38:36.230 --> 01:38:37.150]
Makes you like Wicked and Knees.

[01:38:37.370 --> 01:38:39.470]
Like that one picture they showed a roblo in his bathing suit.

[01:38:39.470 --> 01:38:40.570]
And who's about like, I don't know, 18?

[01:38:41.790 --> 01:38:43.250]
I'm just telling you, an MSNBC.

[01:38:43.470 --> 01:38:45.490]
And that was before the cable of coming and fixed my picture, too.

[01:38:46.130 --> 01:38:47.670]
Which, thank God for AT&T broadband.

[01:38:47.910 --> 01:38:48.270]
They're the best.

[01:38:48.810 --> 01:38:49.950]
So you go to show...

[01:38:49.950 --> 01:38:51.930]
We get on the air and we start ripping these people.

[01:38:52.010 --> 01:38:53.010]
We know what we're talking about.

[01:38:53.010 --> 01:38:54.370]
And George would like to apologize.

[01:38:55.530 --> 01:38:57.310]
Like Bell South and AT&T.

[01:38:57.590 --> 01:39:02.410]
See, in my house it turned out that when it came to installed in my internet access,

[01:39:02.610 --> 01:39:05.430]
my road runner, whatever we call it, that they...

[01:39:05.430 --> 01:39:06.270]
It was a couple of kids.

[01:39:06.550 --> 01:39:06.690]
Punk.

[01:39:06.810 --> 01:39:07.750]
They know what they were doing.

[01:39:08.550 --> 01:39:10.170]
And so they used the existing wiring.

[01:39:10.470 --> 01:39:11.630]
They didn't replace a bunch of crap.

[01:39:11.990 --> 01:39:13.050]
It was garbage.

[01:39:13.670 --> 01:39:14.850]
So the guy came yesterday morning.

[01:39:14.850 --> 01:39:15.670]
He did the whole thing.

[01:39:15.890 --> 01:39:17.250]
But he put about putting in new wire.

[01:39:17.570 --> 01:39:19.210]
And now I'm going to tell you something.

[01:39:19.410 --> 01:39:20.990]
My internet is so fast at the house.

[01:39:20.990 --> 01:39:23.150]
If you don't even have to type it anymore, just think it.

[01:39:23.390 --> 01:39:23.990]
And it goes right to it.

[01:39:24.790 --> 01:39:26.010]
Bell South continues to stop.

[01:39:26.010 --> 01:39:26.490]
Look at that.

[01:39:26.550 --> 01:39:28.170]
Just punched up Bell South on my computer.

[01:39:28.430 --> 01:39:29.170]
When you said that.

[01:39:30.690 --> 01:39:34.450]
And like Carlos was trying to tell you before you start wrapping them again,

[01:39:34.730 --> 01:39:36.870]
and Spiro can cause you again on your answering machine.

[01:39:36.950 --> 01:39:37.550]
I wish you would, though.

[01:39:38.130 --> 01:39:38.850]
Is that...

[01:39:38.850 --> 01:39:39.830]
Maybe it's not Bell South.

[01:39:40.090 --> 01:39:41.150]
We got Bell South right here.

[01:39:41.250 --> 01:39:43.230]
And after the problems we used to have here,

[01:39:43.410 --> 01:39:46.050]
for whatever reason they straightened it out, this thing is fine here.

[01:39:46.070 --> 01:39:46.810]
They commercial.

[01:39:46.970 --> 01:39:49.610]
Have I had any problems on this thing since I did that with the other one day?

[01:39:49.610 --> 01:39:50.790]
It went out a couple of times.

[01:39:50.810 --> 01:39:51.810]
Remember, but very briefly.

[01:39:52.330 --> 01:39:53.430]
But all of the neighborhood.

[01:39:54.630 --> 01:39:54.970]
It's got to be...

[01:39:54.970 --> 01:39:56.230]
Well, why don't you move out of that neighborhood?

[01:39:56.430 --> 01:39:58.510]
You don't belong in Hollywood anyway with all those old people.

[01:39:58.790 --> 01:39:59.290]
I'm getting there.

[01:40:01.370 --> 01:40:02.430]
Maybe I'll buy your house.

[01:40:02.570 --> 01:40:03.130]
I belong in Hollywood.

[01:40:03.450 --> 01:40:04.350]
So I wish Spiro would call,

[01:40:04.450 --> 01:40:06.590]
because I want to find out about Bell South Home Networking.

[01:40:06.650 --> 01:40:08.290]
Spiro Aneus or Spiro Canton?

[01:40:08.750 --> 01:40:08.750]

[01:40:10.150 --> 01:40:12.010]
I don't have the right copy here, you know?

[01:40:12.150 --> 01:40:12.610]
Oh, yes I did.

[01:40:13.610 --> 01:40:15.070]
Got a new copy from Fatboy.

[01:40:15.210 --> 01:40:15.830]
How is Fatboy?

[01:40:15.950 --> 01:40:16.790]
I hadn't seen him in a long time.

[01:40:16.910 --> 01:40:17.050]
Fat.

[01:40:18.370 --> 01:40:21.510]
I don't say that, say Pleasantly Plump like Julio likes.

[01:40:21.930 --> 01:40:22.910]
Let me tell you something, okay?

[01:40:22.990 --> 01:40:25.190]
On this show, especially in my case,

[01:40:25.510 --> 01:40:26.310]
since I'm fat.

[01:40:26.410 --> 01:40:27.630]
If I was skinny would be nasty.

[01:40:27.890 --> 01:40:32.330]
We don't refer to fat people as Pleasantly Plump or anything like that.

[01:40:32.670 --> 01:40:34.370]
There's nothing pleasant about being fat.

[01:40:35.090 --> 01:40:35.530]
Julio.

[01:40:36.790 --> 01:40:39.370]
I mean, is he really that out of it?

[01:40:39.570 --> 01:40:40.730]
He doesn't understand that...

[01:40:40.730 --> 01:40:41.250]
Yeah, sensitive.

[01:40:41.450 --> 01:40:44.630]
In other words, he's got a real sore nerve that I hid.

[01:40:44.630 --> 01:40:47.570]
I think it's right in this pooping.

[01:40:48.170 --> 01:40:49.590]
Come on Julio, lose that weight.

[01:40:49.710 --> 01:40:50.550]
He said he's doing atkins.

[01:40:50.670 --> 01:40:51.990]
Keep it up, lose an answer to, okay?

[01:40:52.230 --> 01:40:53.350]
Have a contest with a beast.

[01:40:54.110 --> 01:40:54.550]
Can't hurt.

[01:40:54.910 --> 01:40:55.810]
Pass up a meal or two.

[01:40:56.070 --> 01:40:56.810]
Bring the food in for us.

[01:40:56.970 --> 01:40:57.410]
We'll eat anything.

[01:40:57.970 --> 01:40:59.030]
Except Carlos, who's picky.

[01:40:59.390 --> 01:40:59.950]
See, that's the thing.

[01:41:00.010 --> 01:41:00.970]
When you weigh like 40 pounds,

[01:41:01.330 --> 01:41:02.450]
and you can bathe in the sink,

[01:41:02.750 --> 01:41:04.310]
you shouldn't really be that picky at this point.

[01:41:04.370 --> 01:41:05.370]
That's why he only weighs four pounds.

[01:41:05.370 --> 01:41:07.050]
And when you're making like a buck and a half an hour,

[01:41:07.350 --> 01:41:08.630]
and they're like a $25 windfall,

[01:41:09.490 --> 01:41:11.030]
like yesterday is like five weeks salary,

[01:41:11.310 --> 01:41:12.390]
you can't afford to be that picky.

[01:41:12.550 --> 01:41:13.990]
Well, he obviously doesn't buy food with that money.

[01:41:13.990 --> 01:41:15.030]
I say, he buys slopes.

[01:41:15.730 --> 01:41:17.490]
Maybe you can bring him in some of that great soups here,

[01:41:17.590 --> 01:41:18.290]
that Nissan soup.

[01:41:19.370 --> 01:41:21.310]
10.57 at 5.60 WQM.

[01:41:21.430 --> 01:41:22.130]
If you're sleeping on a crap,

[01:41:22.130 --> 01:41:23.010]
you'll ruin our mattress.

[01:41:23.250 --> 01:41:23.770]
Believe me.

[01:41:24.230 --> 01:41:25.470]
Your back will tell you the message,

[01:41:25.490 --> 01:41:26.590]
and it's not a good one either,

[01:41:26.770 --> 01:41:28.130]
because you're not getting a good night's sleep.

[01:41:28.330 --> 01:41:29.150]
And so you wake up in the morning,

[01:41:29.170 --> 01:41:30.350]
feel ungrumpy and out of shape,

[01:41:30.510 --> 01:41:32.190]
and all day long, you feel like crap.

[01:41:32.550 --> 01:41:33.490]
If you want to feel great,

[01:41:33.650 --> 01:41:34.610]
get you a name, brand mattress,

[01:41:34.910 --> 01:41:35.730]
and an unbeatable price,

[01:41:35.950 --> 01:41:37.310]
and unbeatable deal all the way around.

[01:41:37.590 --> 01:41:38.550]
You know what I'm talking about now,

[01:41:38.570 --> 01:41:40.030]
but I'm getting two, it's dial amatrus.

[01:41:40.450 --> 01:41:41.210]
I always do it,

[01:41:41.230 --> 01:41:42.130]
and you ought to be doing the same.

[01:41:42.130 --> 01:41:43.390]
Call 1-800-MATRUS,

[01:41:43.510 --> 01:41:44.290]
it's a piece of cake.

[01:41:44.570 --> 01:41:45.190]
They got seely,

surda, simons,

[01:41:46.090 --> 01:41:47.330]
kingcool, every size, and stuff.

[01:41:47.630 --> 01:41:48.830]
You'll have 30 days to try it out,

[01:41:48.850 --> 01:41:50.830]
and your home with the best comfort exchange policy in the world.

[01:41:51.130 --> 01:41:53.970]
A lot of stores make your sleep on your new mattress for at least 30-60 nights,

[01:41:54.250 --> 01:41:55.090]
before making an exchange,

[01:41:55.250 --> 01:41:56.830]
which means if you're not comfortable the first night,

[01:41:57.130 --> 01:41:58.970]
you just bought 59 more sleepless nights.

[01:41:59.050 --> 01:42:00.430]
Then they charge you for restock.

[01:42:00.550 --> 01:42:02.370]
Read, livery, and you pay full retail price on exchanges.

[01:42:02.790 --> 01:42:03.750]
And as far as livery is concerned,

[01:42:03.910 --> 01:42:04.890]
they'll show up when they feel like it.

[01:42:05.150 --> 01:42:06.650]
Not a dial amatrus for real comfort,

[01:42:06.730 --> 01:42:07.910]

[01:42:25.610 --> 01:42:26.370]
and the mattress is too,

[01:42:26.790 --> 01:42:28.130]
the betting consultant suggests.

[01:42:28.490 --> 01:42:29.970]
So make the call right now to dial amatrus,

[01:42:29.990 --> 01:42:31.390]
and enjoy a great night's sleep call.

[01:42:31.750 --> 01:42:34.170]
1-800-MATRUS MATTRES.

[01:42:34.530 --> 01:42:35.430]
It tells them that fat boy,

[01:42:35.470 --> 01:42:36.250]
that's PhAT,

[01:42:36.590 --> 01:42:37.650]
fat boy, told you to call.

[01:42:37.990 --> 01:42:40.130]
1-800-MATRUS for our good friends at dial amatrus.

[01:42:40.130 --> 01:42:40.650]
5-800-MATRUS MATTRES.

[01:42:40.650 --> 01:42:41.270]
It's my life,

[01:42:41.550 --> 01:42:42.210]
and look all,

[01:42:42.570 --> 01:42:44.330]
this is 4205-60,

[01:42:44.830 --> 01:42:46.470]
the way you am.

[01:42:48.410 --> 01:42:50.030]
Bang in the butt, honey.

[01:42:51.870 --> 01:42:53.990]
Don't fear the taxi cab,

[01:42:54.230 --> 01:42:55.470]
but that driver said,

[01:42:55.550 --> 01:42:56.010]
oh, Pog.

[01:42:56.830 --> 01:42:59.390]
You looked at me so quesitally,

[01:42:59.690 --> 01:43:01.290]
I could tell he was in a dock.

[01:43:02.050 --> 01:43:05.230]
So I acted out my puncture in,

[01:43:05.490 --> 01:43:08.030]
and with my arms the trees I made.

[01:43:08.030 --> 01:43:10.050]
There's no bug to speak English,

[01:43:10.430 --> 01:43:11.030]
and they're mulled.

[01:43:14.770 --> 01:43:17.250]
I went down to my amabeeach,

[01:43:17.290 --> 01:43:19.090]
where the weather is nice and sunny.

[01:43:19.710 --> 01:43:22.350]
I walked into a liquor store,

[01:43:22.650 --> 01:43:24.310]
but a guy there talks real funny.

[01:43:24.990 --> 01:43:26.670]
I asked him for a pint of,

[01:43:26.730 --> 01:43:27.890]
hold your beam, he says,

[01:43:28.130 --> 01:43:29.950]
not the end of what does that mean?

[01:43:30.770 --> 01:43:32.290]
The butter speaks English,

[01:43:32.710 --> 01:43:33.570]
and I'm all,

[01:43:34.590 --> 01:43:36.650]
I'm going to Delhi.

[01:43:37.830 --> 01:43:39.650]
Hell, I think I'm in Pakistan,

[01:43:39.710 --> 01:43:41.570]
speaking with smelly.

[01:43:42.630 --> 01:43:44.750]
Or you can go back to Iraq.

[01:43:52.650 --> 01:43:55.810]
I came here many years ago,

[01:43:56.910 --> 01:43:58.030]
learned my abysses.

[01:43:59.230 --> 01:44:01.150]
I don't say much is grossiest,

[01:44:01.630 --> 01:44:02.930]
I say pretty pretty,

[01:44:02.950 --> 01:44:06.090]
so get yourself to a classroom,

[01:44:06.290 --> 01:44:07.650]
quit here in America now,

[01:44:07.830 --> 01:44:09.210]
stop making this thing.

[01:44:09.590 --> 01:44:11.210]
You know what, I speak English.

[01:44:11.630 --> 01:44:12.170]
Come in and mull.

[01:44:14.910 --> 01:44:15.870]
I'm going with you, Lucky.

[01:44:16.030 --> 01:44:17.170]
11-03-560,

[01:44:17.250 --> 01:44:18.270]
WQM Happy Tuesday,

[01:44:18.390 --> 01:44:19.510]
we're having a great time today.

[01:44:19.630 --> 01:44:20.650]
Mo was out sick this morning,

[01:44:20.810 --> 01:44:21.630]
guilty of the show's soul.

[01:44:21.750 --> 01:44:23.010]
We had a lot of food out there in the hallway.

[01:44:23.550 --> 01:44:24.210]
Bonded with Zach,

[01:44:24.390 --> 01:44:25.790]
and Robert, everybody was bouncing around.

[01:44:26.010 --> 01:44:26.610]
Like all times,

[01:44:26.670 --> 01:44:27.670]
just this one day, you know.

[01:44:28.290 --> 01:44:30.150]
Like a visiting...

[01:44:30.150 --> 01:44:31.370]
Yeah, I'm visiting to the past,

[01:44:31.590 --> 01:44:33.010]
in the time-tunnel with James Deerin.

[01:44:33.850 --> 01:44:34.670]
You know, this iced tea,

[01:44:34.770 --> 01:44:35.570]
I want to thank ponytail

[01:44:35.570 --> 01:44:37.050]
for ruining my throat.

[01:44:37.310 --> 01:44:38.170]
Now he didn't do it intentionally.

[01:44:38.330 --> 01:44:39.430]
He did it with the best of intentions.

[01:44:39.850 --> 01:44:40.270]
One of these,

[01:44:40.290 --> 01:44:40.850]
once in a while,

[01:44:40.950 --> 01:44:41.710]
he snapped his iced tea,

[01:44:41.770 --> 01:44:43.730]
but I'm sitting here drinking this

[01:44:43.730 --> 01:44:45.070]
by the gallon yesterday and today,

[01:44:45.150 --> 01:44:46.710]
and I'm getting like scratchy throat,

[01:44:46.790 --> 01:44:48.590]
thinking I'm catching a bug or something in the vents here.

[01:44:48.770 --> 01:44:49.610]
It's got nothing to do with that.

[01:44:49.690 --> 01:44:50.330]
It's the iced tea.

[01:44:52.050 --> 01:44:52.690]
Do you know what I mean?

[01:44:52.850 --> 01:44:54.070]
Have you ever drank anything that like,

[01:44:54.530 --> 01:44:56.530]
sir, you know I'm trying to describe,

[01:44:56.950 --> 01:44:57.890]
and like if you started like,

[01:44:58.030 --> 01:44:58.810]
Fleming up a little bit,

[01:44:58.810 --> 01:45:00.150]
and like it's just iced tea,

[01:45:00.230 --> 01:45:00.850]
especially, is like,

[01:45:00.970 --> 01:45:01.430]
caustic.

[01:45:02.070 --> 01:45:02.750]
See what I'm saying?

[01:45:02.830 --> 01:45:03.970]
Like, to show it's caustic.

[01:45:04.130 --> 01:45:05.510]
Well, some of those have lemon.

[01:45:05.690 --> 01:45:06.570]
They've got lemon iced teas.

[01:45:07.330 --> 01:45:08.850]
Yeah, and lemon is acidic in here.

[01:45:08.850 --> 01:45:10.050]
That's what I'm drinking,

[01:45:10.210 --> 01:45:10.790]
is it's acidic,

[01:45:10.990 --> 01:45:11.570]
like Gary Sarner.

[01:45:12.450 --> 01:45:13.010]
And I'm not...

[01:45:13.010 --> 01:45:13.790]
I haven't...

[01:45:13.790 --> 01:45:14.970]
I've only seen Gary Sarner briefly

[01:45:14.970 --> 01:45:16.610]
for about 10 seconds outside twice,

[01:45:16.710 --> 01:45:17.210]
since I've been back,

[01:45:17.410 --> 01:45:18.910]
which is another reason I'm in a very good mood.

[01:45:19.330 --> 01:45:20.850]
Because he really makes me nauseous.

[01:45:21.050 --> 01:45:21.510]
And then, of course,

[01:45:21.510 --> 01:45:22.710]
seeing his double in Amsterdam,

[01:45:22.930 --> 01:45:24.430]
maybe that's one of the reasons I've burned out in Amsterdam.

[01:45:24.690 --> 01:45:25.810]
I've seen his double over there so much,

[01:45:26.250 --> 01:45:27.610]
hanging down in the middle of the red light district,

[01:45:27.610 --> 01:45:28.250]
all the time.

[01:45:28.990 --> 01:45:30.430]
I say, hey, Gary, how you done?

[01:45:30.910 --> 01:45:31.770]
Lemon, lemon, like that.

[01:45:32.130 --> 01:45:32.490]
Real nerd.

[01:45:33.270 --> 01:45:34.290]
Here's the fact that it says,

[01:45:34.450 --> 01:45:36.030]
I don't know if you already mentioned,

[01:45:36.270 --> 01:45:36.610]
Beyonce Knowles.

[01:45:39.630 --> 01:45:40.070]
Okay.

[01:45:40.490 --> 01:45:41.070]
Okay, what?

[01:45:41.550 --> 01:45:42.110]
She's cute.

[01:45:42.310 --> 01:45:44.290]
Her picture is in one of these tabloids here.

[01:45:44.410 --> 01:45:45.610]
She looks like...

[01:45:45.610 --> 01:45:46.090]
She's hot.

[01:45:47.210 --> 01:45:47.610]
She's hot.

[01:45:47.830 --> 01:45:47.830]

[01:45:47.830 --> 01:45:49.690]
Beyonce, that's what I sent to on the last either.

[01:45:50.350 --> 01:45:51.670]
I'm sure you already know that.

[01:45:52.290 --> 01:45:52.950]
He knows his ass.

[01:45:53.250 --> 01:45:54.050]
He knows his ass,

[01:45:54.270 --> 01:45:54.630]
Cento.

[01:45:55.090 --> 01:45:55.590]
Serena Williams.

[01:45:55.590 --> 01:45:57.890]
I've not given this to William Sisters,

[01:45:57.890 --> 01:45:58.410]
our hot.

[01:45:58.630 --> 01:45:59.570]
Okay, they're not hot.

[01:46:00.870 --> 01:46:02.110]
You think that they're hot?

[01:46:02.470 --> 01:46:03.970]
I've finished them pretty hot and sweaty,

[01:46:04.170 --> 01:46:04.590]
but not...

[01:46:05.450 --> 01:46:05.450]

[01:46:05.450 --> 01:46:06.370]
Naomi Campbell?

[01:46:07.910 --> 01:46:09.510]
Is she kind of like Luther Campbell?

[01:46:11.270 --> 01:46:12.230]
Who is Naomi Campbell?

[01:46:12.450 --> 01:46:12.690]
Model.

[01:46:14.050 --> 01:46:15.110]
What about pink?

[01:46:17.550 --> 01:46:18.990]
She's interesting as opposed to...

[01:46:18.990 --> 01:46:19.730]
What are you giving me?

[01:46:19.870 --> 01:46:20.830]
He's like Adamant.

[01:46:21.070 --> 01:46:22.550]
He is just absolutely Adamant.

[01:46:22.730 --> 01:46:23.470]
He don't like that hair.

[01:46:23.750 --> 01:46:25.150]
Oh, her hair isn't really pink anymore.

[01:46:25.150 --> 01:46:25.610]
No.

[01:46:25.990 --> 01:46:27.150]
Whichever you're going to have a name pink,

[01:46:27.270 --> 01:46:28.990]
why do you have like Auburn hair now?

[01:46:29.130 --> 01:46:29.930]
Parts that are still there.

[01:46:30.450 --> 01:46:30.650]
Yeah.

[01:46:31.210 --> 01:46:32.950]
And parts you're interested in checking out.

[01:46:33.410 --> 01:46:34.630]
How do you know that for sure?

[01:46:35.050 --> 01:46:35.750]
I'll get back to you.

[01:46:35.930 --> 01:46:36.210]
Okay.

[01:46:36.710 --> 01:46:38.270]
Naomi Campbell, did you say yes or no?

[01:46:38.390 --> 01:46:40.570]
I can't believe we got lost on that in the middle of...

[01:46:40.570 --> 01:46:41.770]
Well, we're in the pink of things here.

[01:46:41.830 --> 01:46:42.350]
I'll tell you that.

[01:46:43.190 --> 01:46:43.750]
Naomi Campbell.

[01:46:45.430 --> 01:46:45.710]
Okay.

[01:46:45.950 --> 01:46:47.050]
Got a good list going here, folks.

[01:46:47.350 --> 01:46:48.810]
And this is the kind of show we're going to do every day.

[01:46:48.910 --> 01:46:49.730]
I think you know something?

[01:46:50.530 --> 01:46:51.470]
All we need to do now,

[01:46:51.490 --> 01:46:52.550]
this makes it a little bit more difficult.

[01:46:52.730 --> 01:46:53.950]
If we can just come up with some list,

[01:46:53.950 --> 01:46:55.570]
it's not repetitive like we always do.

[01:46:55.690 --> 01:46:56.850]
We don't want to do the same stuff.

[01:46:57.250 --> 01:46:58.930]
Although tomorrow we will be doing your favorite businesses

[01:46:58.930 --> 01:46:59.690]
that are not all in business.

[01:47:00.290 --> 01:47:01.870]
But, uh, no, seriously, a list.

[01:47:02.570 --> 01:47:04.530]
How about businesses that aren't in business yet?

[01:47:05.670 --> 01:47:06.730]
And, that's a good one.

[01:47:07.230 --> 01:47:08.830]
Businesses that you once thought ago

[01:47:08.830 --> 01:47:10.210]
and you knew it turned out to be a bunch of cramp.

[01:47:10.290 --> 01:47:10.930]
Something like that.

[01:47:11.910 --> 01:47:12.330]
What is this?

[01:47:12.470 --> 01:47:12.950]
Mark Harmon.

[01:47:13.330 --> 01:47:14.110]
Oh, here's the bio.

[01:47:14.810 --> 01:47:16.350]
His wife Pam Dobbers from Gross Point,

[01:47:16.410 --> 01:47:17.830]
Michigan and West Mindy and more commendy.

[01:47:18.410 --> 01:47:18.590]
Oh.

[01:47:19.070 --> 01:47:19.130]
Okay.

[01:47:19.390 --> 01:47:21.150]
Son of Tom Harmon and Elise Knox.

[01:47:21.470 --> 01:47:22.970]
Sister Kelly is the Tic-Tac model.

[01:47:22.970 --> 01:47:24.610]
Older sister is Chris Tinker.

[01:47:25.070 --> 01:47:26.650]
That's the one who was married to her over at Nelson.

[01:47:27.110 --> 01:47:28.910]
That makes him the uncle of actress Tracey Nelson

[01:47:28.910 --> 01:47:31.890]
and musician's Matthew and Gunner Nelson of the band Nelson.

[01:47:32.330 --> 01:47:34.070]
In 1987, Harmon and his wife Pam Dobbers

[01:47:34.070 --> 01:47:36.730]
sued a sister Chris for custody of his younger son Sam.

[01:47:37.930 --> 01:47:41.590]
We've seen all of those on VH1 and on MSNBC, et cetera.

[01:47:41.830 --> 01:47:43.010]
I kind of enjoy watching those shows.

[01:47:43.010 --> 01:47:43.670]
Those are kind of it.

[01:47:43.830 --> 01:47:44.730]
And a biography channel.

[01:47:46.230 --> 01:47:46.690]
Let's see.

[01:47:46.810 --> 01:47:48.450]
Please play Mo's Got a Brand New Bag.

[01:47:48.890 --> 01:47:49.570]
What is that called?

[01:47:49.710 --> 01:47:50.550]
Mo's Got a Brand New Bag.

[01:47:50.690 --> 01:47:51.170]
Is that the name of it?

[01:47:52.670 --> 01:47:53.410]
I don't know.

[01:47:54.290 --> 01:47:54.790]
Let's see.

[01:47:54.930 --> 01:47:57.950]
The bad news is that Boca Brian.

[01:47:58.110 --> 01:47:58.910]
Oh, don't forget about that.

[01:47:58.930 --> 01:47:59.890]
Is he coming in today or tomorrow?

[01:48:00.010 --> 01:48:00.250]
Tomorrow.

[01:48:00.410 --> 01:48:01.330]
Oh, tomorrow because it's very early.

[01:48:01.410 --> 01:48:02.190]
I told him earlier.

[01:48:02.390 --> 01:48:05.650]
Heading coming early to make sure that all of that good stuff gets done.

[01:48:06.250 --> 01:48:06.850]
Now, let's see.

[01:48:08.510 --> 01:48:09.590]
How it gets raped,

[01:48:10.110 --> 01:48:10.990]
Fagidor and Ingenia,

[01:48:13.070 --> 01:48:13.810]
MHD Play.

[01:48:14.070 --> 01:48:14.670]
I don't know what that means.

[01:48:16.570 --> 01:48:17.270]
You're fired.

[01:48:17.530 --> 01:48:20.230]
I do like you're fired.

[01:48:22.750 --> 01:48:23.910]
I'm looking at all the mobs.

[01:48:24.090 --> 01:48:27.430]
Because some of the ones that are not in here, including we don't even have the CD.

[01:48:27.610 --> 01:48:28.530]
Do you have a copy of the CD?

[01:48:28.910 --> 01:48:29.070]
No.

[01:48:29.650 --> 01:48:30.490]
Mine is in Toronto.

[01:48:30.670 --> 01:48:31.230]
I didn't bring it back.

[01:48:31.330 --> 01:48:35.570]
I assumed like anybody else with a brain at we would have a whole bunch of copies here.

[01:48:35.850 --> 01:48:36.430]
We don't have one.

[01:48:36.970 --> 01:48:38.230]
We don't have a single one.

[01:48:38.950 --> 01:48:41.650]
Mo drops the bomb of the Tony Bruno show.

[01:48:43.090 --> 01:48:45.970]
Mo, howl, I find all kinds of mobs.

[01:48:46.110 --> 01:48:47.770]
But the one they're looking for, I don't think we've got here.

[01:48:47.770 --> 01:48:51.090]
And even with the Chris and Aronde one, which is one of my favorites,

[01:48:51.290 --> 01:48:52.010]
that's not here.

[01:48:52.210 --> 01:48:52.790]
Do you have that there?

[01:48:53.150 --> 01:48:53.290]
No.

[01:48:53.950 --> 01:48:56.310]
So, Bokam, when you come in tomorrow, how about bringing this one to the CD?

[01:48:56.610 --> 01:48:58.250]
And we might even pay for it, but I doubt it.

[01:48:59.710 --> 01:49:01.390]
So, John and Lakeworth was a good guy.

[01:49:01.490 --> 01:49:02.530]
We'll play that when we get around to it.

[01:49:02.650 --> 01:49:03.210]
We feel like it.

[01:49:03.890 --> 01:49:04.370]
What else?

[01:49:04.630 --> 01:49:06.330]
Catherine Bell of the TV show, JAG?

[01:49:06.450 --> 01:49:06.850]
What do you say?

[01:49:07.510 --> 01:49:07.770]
Yes.

[01:49:09.530 --> 01:49:11.970]
Off a lot of the hottest people in the world about there, you know what?

[01:49:13.690 --> 01:49:16.270]
Catherine Bell, which makes you feel real sorry about living in sound.

[01:49:16.270 --> 01:49:17.210]
No relation to Maddie.

[01:49:18.730 --> 01:49:19.570]
Oh, thank God.

[01:49:19.650 --> 01:49:21.730]
He probably comes out to her in kneecap.

[01:49:22.650 --> 01:49:23.110]
Any questions?

[01:49:23.350 --> 01:49:24.610]
Check out FHM Magazine.

[01:49:24.890 --> 01:49:29.110]
Well, Dr. Day, we don't have to have any questions because George says absolutely no problem at all.

[01:49:31.190 --> 01:49:32.930]
Let's see, we get all Mark Harman straight now.

[01:49:33.210 --> 01:49:34.970]
Neil, I own my own environmental consulting firm.

[01:49:35.090 --> 01:49:35.510]
I'm a big fan.

[01:49:35.590 --> 01:49:37.450]
We'd like to offer free air sampling and bulk sampling.

[01:49:37.490 --> 01:49:38.210]
No strings attached.

[01:49:40.150 --> 01:49:41.690]
Hey, I better give you this number.

[01:49:41.930 --> 01:49:43.430]
Okay, and a guy's name is George with a J.

[01:49:43.490 --> 01:49:45.830]
Save the guy's name is George with a J.

[01:49:45.830 --> 01:49:46.610]
Oh, it's big.

[01:49:46.870 --> 01:49:47.490]
So there you go.

[01:49:47.710 --> 01:49:48.290]
We'll give it the death.

[01:49:49.790 --> 01:49:54.430]
I would like to suggest Jason Statham, star of the transporter and co-star of a beautiful thing.

[01:49:54.630 --> 01:49:55.590]
He's got a beautiful thing.

[01:49:56.370 --> 01:49:56.730]
Wow.

[01:49:57.790 --> 01:49:58.990]
Are we going to get to see it?

[01:49:59.070 --> 01:49:59.570]
I wouldn't like him.

[01:50:00.970 --> 01:50:01.530]
How do you know that?

[01:50:02.170 --> 01:50:03.570]
How do you know I wouldn't like him?

[01:50:03.890 --> 01:50:04.530]
He's not your type.

[01:50:04.970 --> 01:50:05.830]
Well, what's my type?

[01:50:06.730 --> 01:50:10.030]
Not big, burly, skin-headed muscle guys.

[01:50:11.510 --> 01:50:12.410]
That's not my type.

[01:50:12.770 --> 01:50:13.330]
Last time I checked.

[01:50:13.330 --> 01:50:14.530]
I think he looked pretty good.

[01:50:14.550 --> 01:50:15.030]
Back there on the wall.

[01:50:15.130 --> 01:50:15.770]
There's two of them.

[01:50:16.030 --> 01:50:16.230]
Back in.

[01:50:16.910 --> 01:50:18.230]
And so I guess not.

[01:50:18.790 --> 01:50:18.790]

[01:50:19.010 --> 01:50:19.650]
That's not hard.

[01:50:19.810 --> 01:50:23.150]
Well, does that mean because it's not my type that he's not, uh, it couldn't be?

[01:50:23.290 --> 01:50:24.210]
Well, somebody likes him.

[01:50:24.430 --> 01:50:25.190]
Somebody likes him.

[01:50:25.190 --> 01:50:25.510]
That's good.

[01:50:25.790 --> 01:50:28.630]
He's okay, by the way, as far as like the movies that he's in.

[01:50:28.670 --> 01:50:29.450]
Soma Hayek.

[01:50:30.150 --> 01:50:30.510]
Whatever.

[01:50:31.070 --> 01:50:33.110]
Katzm Delt from Jag, which we just put on there again.

[01:50:33.230 --> 01:50:33.530]
Look at that.

[01:50:33.750 --> 01:50:34.710]
From Tim and Homestead.

[01:50:34.850 --> 01:50:35.250]
Thank you, Tim.

[01:50:35.410 --> 01:50:36.170]
Soma Hayek, you said.

[01:50:36.410 --> 01:50:37.790]
She's cute but very overrated.

[01:50:37.870 --> 01:50:42.010]
Everybody makes such a big deal about her and she's just like Penelope Cruz.

[01:50:43.650 --> 01:50:46.030]
No, Penelope Cruz is downright unattractive.

[01:50:46.190 --> 01:50:46.950]
Look at that nose.

[01:50:47.550 --> 01:50:50.410]
Who knows, looks like it's been broken several times, even more than J-Lo.

[01:50:50.970 --> 01:50:52.370]
Well, shame on you, man.

[01:50:52.910 --> 01:50:53.470]
Shame on you.

[01:50:54.730 --> 01:50:56.730]
Next year we pick it on Anthony and Apollo Tonno.

[01:50:56.870 --> 01:50:58.070]
Just as we got that Italian nose.

[01:50:58.210 --> 01:50:58.310]
Who?

[01:50:59.290 --> 01:51:01.790]
10 past 11 at 5.60 W-Q-A-M.

[01:51:01.950 --> 01:51:02.210]
What?

[01:51:03.110 --> 01:51:03.750]
The poliano.

[01:51:04.490 --> 01:51:05.270]
The Apollo Tonno.

[01:51:05.390 --> 01:51:06.410]
Hey, you better get with it, mister.

[01:51:07.170 --> 01:51:08.630]
You don't get to learn your soccer players.

[01:51:09.750 --> 01:51:11.690]
Hey, guys, with the new year now in full swing.

[01:51:11.690 --> 01:51:13.870]

Why do I keep drinking in size T?

[01:51:21.110 --> 01:51:21.830]
I know it's killing me.

[01:51:22.170 --> 01:51:23.630]
And I'm sitting here drinking it like a moron.

[01:51:23.650 --> 01:51:24.210]
Am I an idiot?

[01:51:24.370 --> 01:51:24.870]
Yes, I am.

[01:51:25.350 --> 01:51:26.990]
I'm an absolute imbecile.

[01:51:27.730 --> 01:51:29.790]
If you sit in here, I know the stuff is irritating my throat,

[01:51:29.790 --> 01:51:31.430]
which I can't afford to have any irritated throat.

[01:51:31.610 --> 01:51:33.970]

My, my, and locals.

[01:52:20.710 --> 01:52:22.410]
This is Sports Radio 560.

[01:52:23.130 --> 01:52:24.590]
You ain't can way, yeah.

[01:52:26.650 --> 01:52:28.610]
With the sewer of this place.

[01:52:35.490 --> 01:52:36.010]
The

[01:52:36.010 --> 01:52:43.850]
door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door door.

[01:52:44.070 --> 01:52:47.750]
My amo how it day ended, decrepit and am ancient.

[01:52:48.110 --> 01:52:51.650]
All my own face are blue and red is purple, face.

[01:52:51.950 --> 01:52:53.470]
I don't know why they hate me.

[01:52:53.850 --> 01:52:55.390]
Oh, why they always wait me.

[01:52:55.730 --> 01:52:58.410]
It must be because I can't be blue and red is purple.

[01:52:59.290 --> 01:53:02.670]
My amo, on my arm like a ramic now he mappalaka wad.

[01:53:02.830 --> 01:53:06.630]
I got things on my nose and nobody knows that under my clothes I wear fancy hoes.

[01:53:06.690 --> 01:53:08.290]
But that no mean that I'm gay.

[01:53:08.550 --> 01:53:10.430]
If you take my arms away and you ought to see my legs.

[01:53:10.630 --> 01:53:14.390]
Am I as well keep on smoothing, shaved, and show a little glazed the next time I'm raping it.

[01:53:14.590 --> 01:53:16.830]
I can go through a surgeon, but that gives me to shivers.

[01:53:17.030 --> 01:53:18.930]
I wouldn't want the walk I'm looking like Joan Rivers.

[01:53:20.030 --> 01:53:20.690]
Where am I?

[01:53:21.350 --> 01:53:23.310]
I fired the beast, the fat little freak.

[01:53:23.730 --> 01:53:25.630]
I hit him up paper now we can afford to eat.

[01:53:25.630 --> 01:53:31.230]
The reason I dismissed that stinkin' fat bastard is because he wouldn't shut up and he can't play connesial.

[01:53:32.210 --> 01:53:34.630]
I saw him talk over there, nobody talks when I rap.

[01:53:34.990 --> 01:53:35.850]
I rap then you talk.

[01:53:36.530 --> 01:53:39.030]
Look at me, I'm in, I ain't no square.

[01:53:39.710 --> 01:53:42.030]
I'm a ding-dong daddy man, I'm really dead.

[01:53:43.250 --> 01:53:45.890]
I, I have anyone I want, I don't care.

[01:53:46.290 --> 01:53:48.910]
But believe they make me flip my wig made a smelly green hair.

[01:53:49.510 --> 01:53:52.150]
I've had fired myself and even happens to the greets.

[01:53:52.150 --> 01:53:54.890]
When one said you'll get out of here whilst we break your legs.

[01:53:55.230 --> 01:53:57.690]
So now I sit by the pool, life's as good as it gets.

[01:53:58.350 --> 01:54:01.050]
With my paladin cartel, placing bets on the gems.

[01:54:01.430 --> 01:54:04.830]
In paradise, paradise, I don't kiss nobody's ass in paradise.

[01:54:06.450 --> 01:54:08.530]
I'll be shivering on the street until I get the gems.

[01:54:08.830 --> 01:54:10.650]
But the cleaners aren't ready with my lime green pants.

[01:54:10.990 --> 01:54:11.670]
How long does it take?

[01:54:11.910 --> 01:54:12.730]
Get the calling from play.

[01:54:12.970 --> 01:54:15.030]
It was just a little thought, so what I love this day.

[01:54:15.270 --> 01:54:17.470]
I think that's funny when I know the sandwich buddy.

[01:54:17.810 --> 01:54:19.730]
I can do what I want, but the management loves me.

[01:54:19.730 --> 01:54:22.010]
Gonna tell you something, oh, something you ought to know.

[01:54:22.070 --> 01:54:24.230]
But along this time I wanted you to be my home.

[01:54:24.530 --> 01:54:26.410]
You are my type pal, now I am straight, no no.

[01:54:27.150 --> 01:54:28.090]
Who's the pretty old dog?

[01:54:28.170 --> 01:54:29.270]
I don't take no for an antics.

[01:54:29.310 --> 01:54:29.550]
Look at that.

[01:54:29.870 --> 01:54:32.050]
And when it's time, you, give me the hell out of it.

[01:54:32.190 --> 01:54:32.910]
But I've been, who?

[01:54:33.370 --> 01:54:33.510]
Who?

[01:54:33.570 --> 01:54:33.930]
Who the door is?

[01:54:34.430 --> 01:54:34.790]
Who?

[01:54:35.210 --> 01:54:35.950]
Who the door is?

[01:54:36.250 --> 01:54:37.090]
Who the door is?

[01:54:37.630 --> 01:54:37.770]
Who?

[01:54:37.950 --> 01:54:38.750]
Who the door is?

[01:54:39.050 --> 01:54:40.230]
Who the door is?

[01:54:40.590 --> 01:54:40.810]
Who the door is?

[01:54:40.810 --> 01:54:41.850]
Who the door is?

[01:54:42.130 --> 01:54:43.730]
Who the door is?

[01:54:51.910 --> 01:55:05.910]
Who the door is?

[01:55:06.070 --> 01:55:06.070]

[01:55:06.070 --> 01:55:06.070]

[01:55:06.070 --> 01:55:06.070]

[01:55:06.070 --> 01:55:06.070]

I'm moving right along.

[02:00:45.250 --> 02:00:46.290]
Jennifer Conley.

[02:00:47.790 --> 02:00:49.530]
I'm just telling you the way it is.

[02:00:49.830 --> 02:00:50.270]
That's fine.

[02:00:50.530 --> 02:00:52.210]
He had such beautiful, smooth skin.

[02:00:52.690 --> 02:00:56.450]
Anyway, Jennifer Conley and Ricky the greasiest.

[02:00:56.610 --> 02:00:58.210]
How come he is so poorly here?

[02:00:58.410 --> 02:00:59.690]
We got all the Anglo's out there.

[02:01:00.670 --> 02:01:02.470]
Jessica Simpson has got a parent's photo.

[02:01:02.670 --> 02:01:04.630]
You said about you wouldn't have touched her with anybody else.

[02:01:04.930 --> 02:01:05.850]
With Carlos's hand.

[02:01:07.170 --> 02:01:08.050]
Christine Aguilara.

[02:01:08.170 --> 02:01:08.830]
Oh no.

[02:01:09.690 --> 02:01:11.330]
Thank God she ain't doing too well.

[02:01:11.330 --> 02:01:12.110]
Oh I snore.

[02:01:12.270 --> 02:01:12.450]
Yeah.

[02:01:13.190 --> 02:01:14.030]
She's got a peer.

[02:01:14.330 --> 02:01:15.130]
Ty Banks says one.

[02:01:15.290 --> 02:01:18.810]
And poor Nicholas Shay from 98 degrees he has none.

[02:01:19.170 --> 02:01:20.050]
That's because they vanished.

[02:01:20.490 --> 02:01:21.270]
They just disappeared.

[02:01:21.430 --> 02:01:21.890]
Like overnight.

[02:01:22.450 --> 02:01:24.690]
They woke up one day and they ate no more 98 degrees.

[02:01:24.810 --> 02:01:26.110]
It's more like 98.6 now.

[02:01:26.390 --> 02:01:26.690]
With Keith.

[02:01:27.130 --> 02:01:28.490]
Remember Keith 98.6?

[02:01:28.730 --> 02:01:29.050]
No.

[02:01:29.330 --> 02:01:29.650]
The song?

[02:01:29.910 --> 02:01:30.550]
Oh yeah, the song.

[02:01:31.670 --> 02:01:33.190]
Don't like that song at all by the way.

[02:01:33.410 --> 02:01:33.490]
Yeah.

[02:01:33.770 --> 02:01:37.130]
So we're building a list here today and if Tom don't like it if he wants to see it,

[02:01:37.230 --> 02:01:37.990]
sit here or rant.

[02:01:38.130 --> 02:01:40.570]
You'll want about how the economy sucks it.

[02:01:40.570 --> 02:01:44.930]
The president say right wing fascist and a goose stepper and all of his other, uh, et cetera and so on.

[02:01:44.950 --> 02:01:45.750]
We've already told you that.

[02:01:45.830 --> 02:01:46.830]
What else am I going to do about it?

[02:01:47.330 --> 02:01:48.450]
What am I going to do about it?

[02:01:50.610 --> 02:01:53.730]
This business of change the world radio and all this other bull crap.

[02:01:53.930 --> 02:01:54.870]
Oh they much love that.

[02:01:54.930 --> 02:01:56.510]
Who cares what the hell they love.

[02:01:56.750 --> 02:01:57.790]
I don't give a flying crap.

[02:01:58.710 --> 02:02:04.530]
Just like the day that bitch called this show here like she's orchestrating what we can say and who we can criticize and everything else on this goddamn show.

[02:02:05.930 --> 02:02:10.350]
As far as I'm concerned, come to Lisa can take a w and stick him right up her butt as far as I'm concerned.

[02:02:10.350 --> 02:02:10.690]
Okay.

[02:02:13.350 --> 02:02:14.850]
Just take sure that we are.

[02:02:14.930 --> 02:02:16.330]
Stop and think about it for a second.

[02:02:17.710 --> 02:02:23.430]
5 6 7 0 5 60 don't forget by the way speaking of hot babes and who's going to be there tomorrow any special thing?

[02:02:23.970 --> 02:02:30.650]
No, just us and babes general just you in general general babes join George tomorrow for a happy R5 to 7 to 3.

[02:02:30.750 --> 02:02:33.590]
So I'm going to Miguel will be there because I guess she's letting him out of the house once in a while again.

[02:02:33.690 --> 02:02:34.290]
I'm sure he'll be there.

[02:02:34.310 --> 02:02:34.890]
It's for work.

[02:02:34.890 --> 02:02:42.010]
Fatboy will be there and Boca Brian will be there because he sure ain't getting much located off the palm metal just north of the 120 second street exit.

[02:02:42.230 --> 02:02:44.850]
Stop by for prizes and drink specials unless he's still with Judy.

[02:02:47.610 --> 02:02:52.110]
Anyway, okay he's rolling his eyes and it's a not supposed to say any 25 huh?

[02:02:53.350 --> 02:02:54.290]
They're good friends.

[02:02:54.550 --> 02:02:55.490]
Is that it?

[02:02:55.530 --> 02:02:55.750]
Yeah.

[02:02:55.770 --> 02:02:57.790]
Like I said he ain't getting any so he'll be there desperate.

[02:02:58.210 --> 02:03:00.590]
In fact he might be kind of like rubbing up against Fatboy.

[02:03:01.290 --> 02:03:04.590]
Which all you got to do just show up there and you'll be rubbing up against that Carlos would be there.

[02:03:04.650 --> 02:03:06.630]
I bet the Carlos would be there with bells on believe me.

[02:03:06.870 --> 02:03:07.810]
It's a very spacious place.

[02:03:08.030 --> 02:03:09.610]
You can find room around room to hide.

[02:03:09.750 --> 02:03:10.150]
Yeah.

[02:03:10.850 --> 02:03:13.390]
Carlos would be over there kind of like rubbing up against the wall.

[02:03:14.310 --> 02:03:15.850]
Well the wall is warm I guess.

[02:03:15.990 --> 02:03:20.750]
And our favorite DJ Big Pussy who likes to bust Carlos chops all the while that we're there.

[02:03:20.990 --> 02:03:21.270]
Really?

[02:03:21.430 --> 02:03:21.830]

[02:03:22.510 --> 02:03:23.850]

[02:03:24.750 --> 02:03:25.350]
About being in gay?

[02:03:26.070 --> 02:03:27.150]
Now Carlos is gay?

[02:03:27.730 --> 02:03:28.490]
Just when he's there.

[02:03:28.930 --> 02:03:29.270]
I see.

[02:03:30.870 --> 02:03:31.570]
Oh I see.

[02:03:31.910 --> 02:03:32.210]

You want to finish this show?

[02:03:42.570 --> 02:03:42.690]
No.

[02:03:42.790 --> 02:03:43.630]
Go take it away from the person.

[02:03:43.830 --> 02:03:44.650]
There's a person still there.

[02:03:44.710 --> 02:03:45.930]
There is one.

[02:03:46.170 --> 02:03:47.250]
One ain't going to cut it.

[02:03:47.470 --> 02:03:50.350]
I'm not going to one little Pepsi ain't going to cut it between now and one o'clock.

[02:03:51.250 --> 02:03:52.370]

[02:03:53.530 --> 02:03:53.830]
Okay.

[02:03:53.990 --> 02:03:54.610]
Thank you so much.

[02:03:54.770 --> 02:03:57.210]
Hey Jeff Cole we need and we appreciate the diet snapple.

[02:03:57.210 --> 02:04:00.050]
We were going to hand him out to the homeless voice people on the corner.

[02:04:01.970 --> 02:04:04.110]
But I can't make a living walking around with a sign.

[02:04:05.090 --> 02:04:07.210]
Seriously that stuff tears up your throat.

[02:04:07.630 --> 02:04:08.250]
It's acidic.

[02:04:09.790 --> 02:04:10.510]
Nasty stuff.

[02:04:11.590 --> 02:04:12.610]
Sitting around drinking that.

[02:04:12.750 --> 02:04:16.670]
For example they have like that herbal kind of iced tea that they sell at Jinxing iced tea.

[02:04:16.750 --> 02:04:17.190]
Have you ever had that?

[02:04:17.570 --> 02:04:19.930]
In the supermarket in those big humongous containers.

[02:04:20.270 --> 02:04:21.250]
Like no water jug you got there.

[02:04:21.310 --> 02:04:21.930]
That's good stuff.

[02:04:22.790 --> 02:04:22.990]
Yeah.

[02:04:23.110 --> 02:04:24.010]
Drink that by the gallon.

[02:04:24.410 --> 02:04:24.930]
I'll give it a shot.

[02:04:24.930 --> 02:04:26.950]
I die a gin sing iced tea.

[02:04:27.230 --> 02:04:29.410]
Does it make it long and hard?

[02:04:29.810 --> 02:04:31.130]
It makes it very long.

[02:04:32.870 --> 02:04:33.590]
For some.

[02:04:34.230 --> 02:04:35.150]
26 past 11.

[02:04:35.410 --> 02:04:36.030]
See already.

[02:04:36.370 --> 02:04:36.950]
Can you hear that there?

[02:04:37.050 --> 02:04:38.250]
I took one sip of that Pepsi.

[02:04:38.390 --> 02:04:39.730]
Well it clears your throat right out.

[02:04:39.730 --> 02:04:40.970]
I love that carbon Pepsi spot.

[02:04:41.170 --> 02:04:42.110]
I don't care what anybody said.

[02:04:42.170 --> 02:04:42.570]
I just saw it.

[02:04:42.730 --> 02:04:43.430]
The Osborne spot.

[02:04:43.570 --> 02:04:43.690]
Yeah.

[02:04:44.170 --> 02:04:45.190]
With the obvious.

[02:04:45.970 --> 02:04:46.610]
That's a hoot.

QA.

[02:06:30.050 --> 02:06:39.610]
I got a lot of friends there on the police force here that in confidentiality have told me how much of an asshole prints it.

[02:06:52.150 --> 02:06:54.010]
She spoke to me.

[02:06:54.510 --> 02:06:55.750]
She told me in name.

[02:06:56.350 --> 02:06:58.850]
I couldn't understand a single thing.

[02:06:59.270 --> 02:07:03.230]
She said she'd only been drinking some milk but she let bomb.

[02:07:04.130 --> 02:07:04.710]
Yeah baby.

[02:07:05.170 --> 02:07:07.330]
She spoke to me.

[02:07:07.870 --> 02:07:09.110]
She got very close.

[02:07:10.010 --> 02:07:12.510]
A bit many go-and-go-toes.

[02:07:12.730 --> 02:07:16.770]
She's playing games like body shots and quares.

[02:07:16.770 --> 02:07:18.070]
Yeah baby.

[02:07:18.930 --> 02:07:21.470]
What is he looking like?

[02:07:21.510 --> 02:07:24.870]
Like the bright singing Gary, don't be all night.

[02:07:25.570 --> 02:07:29.210]
They were neck-ab-roll and she ran out.

[02:07:29.430 --> 02:07:31.370]
Cause that girl had to have her energy.

[02:07:31.530 --> 02:07:32.470]
I'm like a girl.

[02:07:32.930 --> 02:07:34.130]
She drank, she drank.

[02:07:35.010 --> 02:07:37.890]
Yeah baby all the booze, the booze.

[02:07:38.310 --> 02:07:40.750]
She's crazy cause she looks like a frog.

[02:07:41.090 --> 02:07:42.270]
Like she drinks like a fish.

[02:07:42.950 --> 02:07:45.490]
I think it's obvious she ain't punished.

[02:07:45.490 --> 02:07:47.590]
She drank, she drank.

[02:07:47.810 --> 02:07:51.270]
Get placed in my drink and all the booze, the booze.

[02:07:51.370 --> 02:07:53.570]
Everybody wants their dance.

[02:07:55.870 --> 02:07:59.150]
She was a little where I side of her band.

[02:08:01.190 --> 02:08:03.010]
Number 32 and 560 W.

[02:08:03.170 --> 02:08:05.950]
By the way Diana Ross, where's that story I had about Diana Ross?

[02:08:06.130 --> 02:08:09.050]
And about how she's boozing up so bad she's committing so-socages?

[02:08:09.570 --> 02:08:11.730]
Here's a nominee that'll definitely be on there.

[02:08:11.830 --> 02:08:12.450]
Fox News Heather.

[02:08:13.010 --> 02:08:16.670]
Alright, even though we find them disgusting and contemptible and obnoxiously, uh,

[02:08:16.950 --> 02:08:17.930]
Repetitionally right wing.

[02:08:19.010 --> 02:08:19.930]
Uh, but Fox News Heather.

[02:08:20.090 --> 02:08:21.110]
Everybody want to do her.

[02:08:21.410 --> 02:08:22.770]
N-A-U-E-R-T.

[02:08:23.430 --> 02:08:24.730]
No just but Fox News Heather.

[02:08:24.910 --> 02:08:26.350]
Not gonna come back to the wonder who the hell it is.

[02:08:26.610 --> 02:08:27.690]
Fox News Heather got it.

[02:08:28.830 --> 02:08:32.190]
Here's a facts from Mustive who says it's becoming a chronic factor as well.

[02:08:32.670 --> 02:08:34.770]
I'm not standing there for some of the old Detroit DJs.

[02:08:34.830 --> 02:08:36.250]
Well we could play that thing again but we're not.

[02:08:36.710 --> 02:08:37.990]
Tom Shannon's also a bastion.

[02:08:38.230 --> 02:08:40.590]
Joel Sebastian was one of my very favorite DJs, okay?

[02:08:40.590 --> 02:08:41.630]
If that'll make you happy.

[02:08:41.930 --> 02:08:42.890]
Even more so than Kimba.

[02:08:43.310 --> 02:08:43.850]
Reek and ball.

[02:08:44.490 --> 02:08:47.290]
Lea Ellen and the Pakistan horn, Don Zee and the Zee Zombies.

[02:08:47.570 --> 02:08:49.150]
Dick Purton of course, Conrad Patrick.

[02:08:49.390 --> 02:08:51.190]
Conrad Patrick was down here on Channel 51.

[02:08:52.310 --> 02:08:53.190]
For about 10 minutes.

[02:08:53.530 --> 02:08:53.990]
Do you know that?

[02:08:54.690 --> 02:08:54.930]
No.

[02:08:55.190 --> 02:08:57.370]
Who's to be in WSYZ and CKLW?

[02:08:57.790 --> 02:08:59.070]
Uh, Jim Davis, I don't know who that is.

[02:08:59.230 --> 02:09:00.810]
Scotty Regan and Pat St. John.

[02:09:01.150 --> 02:09:01.650]
Thank you Steve.

[02:09:02.090 --> 02:09:03.670]
All those with an A's, maybe can we go back?

[02:09:03.830 --> 02:09:03.930]
No.

[02:09:04.050 --> 02:09:06.250]
You want to run minutes about Detroit because it's so sad.

[02:09:06.470 --> 02:09:06.890]
Oh oh.

[02:09:07.410 --> 02:09:11.850]
If you have air sampling done in your office for about approximately 250 bucks it says you'll

[02:09:11.850 --> 02:09:14.830]
have documentation to sue the Schmidt out of these assholes that run your building.

[02:09:14.830 --> 02:09:15.350]
Says Mike.

[02:09:15.610 --> 02:09:17.610]
PSDW use some guy named George with a J.

[02:09:20.030 --> 02:09:21.770]
Don't take it personal or hate.

[02:09:23.150 --> 02:09:28.050]
But this guy says who of course has got his business that it and we appreciate his efforts to save our lives.

[02:09:28.450 --> 02:09:30.130]
He says don't use a guy named.

[02:09:30.210 --> 02:09:30.390]
Jorge.

[02:09:30.750 --> 02:09:30.910]
Right.

[02:09:32.950 --> 02:09:34.290]
Here's a call from Fort Lauderdale.

[02:09:57.550 --> 02:09:57.950]
Hello.

[02:09:58.510 --> 02:09:59.310]
Good morning.

[02:09:59.810 --> 02:10:00.210]
Yes sir.

[02:10:00.310 --> 02:10:01.130]
Brannes to you.

[02:10:01.130 --> 02:10:02.750]
Uh, what did you make a comment on Tom Chic

[02:10:34.590 --> 02:10:37.730]
that was the last time you were in the car.

[02:10:37.730 --> 02:10:37.730]

[02:10:37.730 --> 02:10:38.630]
Nobody's got to know who won.

[02:10:39.430 --> 02:10:41.910]
So what I got put next to it.

[02:10:42.310 --> 02:10:42.550]
Nothing.

[02:10:42.670 --> 02:10:44.950]
You can name some movies that she's been in and nobody will know those.

[02:10:45.310 --> 02:10:45.630]
Okay.

[02:10:45.790 --> 02:10:47.150]
We just describe Monica Belucci.

[02:10:47.530 --> 02:10:47.590]
Okay.

[02:10:47.750 --> 02:10:48.130]
We love.

[02:10:48.230 --> 02:10:49.370]
I love those Italian names.

[02:10:49.630 --> 02:10:49.730]
Okay.

[02:10:50.710 --> 02:10:51.290]
What was that movie?

[02:10:51.450 --> 02:10:51.570]
Cinema.

[02:10:52.370 --> 02:10:53.470]
I love that movie too.

[02:10:53.630 --> 02:10:54.050]
You ever see that?

[02:10:54.190 --> 02:10:54.330]
Yeah.

[02:10:54.470 --> 02:10:58.310]
With the urine, the kid peeing in the gutter and it comes out the gargoyle smell and peeing in the little loser.

[02:10:58.390 --> 02:10:58.470]
Yeah.

[02:10:58.530 --> 02:10:58.550]
It was a kid.

[02:10:58.550 --> 02:10:59.090]
It was a hysterical.

[02:11:00.830 --> 02:11:03.090]
56670560, £560 on the AT&T and Verizon.

[02:11:03.630 --> 02:11:04.350]
Lareless line.

[02:11:05.690 --> 02:11:09.190]
See I didn't realize that you should have probably whipped me with a noodle or something.

[02:11:09.290 --> 02:11:12.130]
But I haven't been taking these people's calls because these factors are just pouring in.

[02:11:12.250 --> 02:11:12.590]
They're calling.

[02:11:12.610 --> 02:11:19.110]
And between the air quality thing and between the other the poll and between little Jerry who's out of control today,

[02:11:19.110 --> 02:11:21.870]
who's today Steve with 75 little cross-tick factors.

[02:11:22.070 --> 02:11:25.590]
None of which do I read by the way they all go into Shmit Can for the squeal of the little writing.

[02:11:26.030 --> 02:11:33.890]
Seriously, the facts machine, I wish the audience could see it because it is such incredible tangible evidence of the state of mental health in this town.

[02:11:34.510 --> 02:11:37.130]
You can't complain about the state of the mental health because there isn't any.

[02:11:38.690 --> 02:11:40.510]
It's like you were open a window and you hear them going,

[02:11:41.110 --> 02:11:43.570]
you see on network they were all going on matter in hell.

[02:11:43.690 --> 02:11:44.410]
I'm not going to take any more.

[02:11:44.590 --> 02:11:45.950]
You open a window out here and you hear,

[02:11:45.950 --> 02:11:47.930]
like that, it's all our facts people.

[02:11:49.810 --> 02:11:54.690]
I would say that the calls that we get are light years ahead of what we get on the facts machine.

[02:11:55.070 --> 02:11:58.250]
The people most of them on the facts machine aren't, they're not up to calling.

[02:11:59.070 --> 02:12:00.530]
Oh, their voice might be recognized.

[02:12:01.050 --> 02:12:04.370]
No, it's not just that I don't think they can make that that many digits consecutively.

[02:12:04.570 --> 02:12:05.590]
They're telling the facts number.

[02:12:05.790 --> 02:12:06.750]
Somebody's doing it for them.

[02:12:07.850 --> 02:12:11.750]
You got a little Jerry with a squeakly who's like out of control today just psychotic.

[02:12:12.730 --> 02:12:14.690]
Notice that none of his facts is ever get read.

[02:12:16.190 --> 02:12:18.790]
Harvey from Hunger who was in his stereo over Fox News.

[02:12:19.030 --> 02:12:22.130]
First of all Harvey from Hunger, what were you watching Fox News for in the first place this morning?

[02:12:22.510 --> 02:12:24.430]
Jack asked, apparently a lot of people were.

[02:12:25.130 --> 02:12:25.890]
What do you mean by that?

[02:12:26.170 --> 02:12:26.670]
All the calls.

[02:12:27.410 --> 02:12:28.190]
All this and that said.

[02:12:28.430 --> 02:12:28.550]
Yeah.

[02:12:29.590 --> 02:12:32.110]
Evidently they cure a lot more than we do because I couldn't give a crap less.

[02:12:33.210 --> 02:12:37.310]
Then we got fat boys, neighbor Dave, who needs desperate help.

[02:12:37.930 --> 02:12:38.470]
Desperate help.

[02:12:40.030 --> 02:12:45.790]
You got Joey aka Tracy Foster who faxes everybody in the building and has since the day we ever said foot in the building,

[02:12:45.790 --> 02:12:47.770]
I'm sure before that it writes with a crayon.

[02:12:48.090 --> 02:12:48.250]
Right.

[02:12:49.650 --> 02:12:53.350]
So in other words on a fact generally when you look at the fast machine it just looks back and you go,

[02:12:53.950 --> 02:12:55.170]
like that and you know what's on there.

[02:12:57.790 --> 02:12:59.170]
Here's a call from Delray Beach.

[02:12:59.410 --> 02:12:59.410]

[02:12:59.910 --> 02:13:00.510]
Hi Neil.

[02:13:00.710 --> 02:13:01.230]
Yes sir.

[02:13:01.530 --> 02:13:04.730]
Yeah, I'm surprised he's charging up the fake hell on your list.

[02:13:05.070 --> 02:13:05.590]
Faith hell.

[02:13:05.990 --> 02:13:06.770]
You know I'm a me.

[02:13:06.770 --> 02:13:08.150]
Yeah, a little faith.

[02:13:08.150 --> 02:13:10.170]
I don't suggest any names for what it's worth.

[02:13:10.370 --> 02:13:10.750]
That's true.

[02:13:10.850 --> 02:13:13.310]
George is just he's censoring as we go along.

[02:13:13.390 --> 02:13:14.050]
He didn't know the suit.

[02:13:14.150 --> 02:13:14.970]
He didn't submit any.

[02:13:15.110 --> 02:13:16.610]
You already said Brittany anyway so.

[02:13:17.110 --> 02:13:17.390]
Yeah.

[02:13:17.530 --> 02:13:19.870]
I got to tell you he George is right though.

[02:13:20.110 --> 02:13:21.130]
And I'll be cruise.

[02:13:21.310 --> 02:13:23.270]
I know she's getting votes but oh god.

[02:13:23.570 --> 02:13:24.830]
She is so pedophily ugly.

[02:13:25.250 --> 02:13:26.810]
How about Christine Aguilera?

[02:13:27.550 --> 02:13:29.110]
Well she's not getting too many votes.

[02:13:29.430 --> 02:13:30.210]
So you know.

[02:13:30.390 --> 02:13:31.830]
Thank God for that.

[02:13:31.930 --> 02:13:33.090]
At least there's some hope out there.

[02:13:33.210 --> 02:13:33.790]
Oh I'm there.

[02:13:33.950 --> 02:13:34.110]
Yeah.

[02:13:34.650 --> 02:13:36.130]
Anyway you guys have a great day.

[02:13:36.350 --> 02:13:37.290]
It's like you're talking with you.

[02:13:37.290 --> 02:13:37.710]
Thanks a lot.

[02:13:38.050 --> 02:13:38.370]
Okay bye.

[02:13:38.670 --> 02:13:39.190]
Okay there you go.

[02:13:39.250 --> 02:13:41.270]
He said the faith hill and you said sure why not.

[02:13:42.430 --> 02:13:44.410]
You know I can't I can't get rid of this thing out here now.

[02:13:44.510 --> 02:13:45.410]
There we go.

[02:13:45.550 --> 02:13:47.270]
Because I don't want to play the rejoin again.

[02:13:47.390 --> 02:13:48.370]
I haven't come up like dead air.

[02:13:48.870 --> 02:13:53.410]
I don't want my brother coming out of that the tea room with just his tea bag hanging in his hand.

[02:13:54.630 --> 02:13:55.470]
So here's our album.

[02:13:55.610 --> 02:13:58.250]
Put these all up here and you decide who you want to have come in here and check the year out.

[02:13:58.270 --> 02:13:59.450]
And then we'll just sue everybody.

[02:14:00.110 --> 02:14:00.430]
Millions.

[02:14:00.870 --> 02:14:01.830]
Will it duck to side?

[02:14:02.250 --> 02:14:03.210]
Will it duck to side?

[02:14:03.210 --> 02:14:04.830]
What's he got to do with it?

[02:14:05.050 --> 02:14:09.190]
Do you think this company is going to spend money to check the year quality out here?

[02:14:09.390 --> 02:14:13.410]
But let's make sure that even though they don't own the building they make decisions about who comes in here and does things.

[02:14:14.530 --> 02:14:15.690]
That's what you think mister.

[02:14:16.130 --> 02:14:17.370]
See now that I'm back down here.

[02:14:17.510 --> 02:14:18.470]
Oh I'm stepping in.

[02:14:18.790 --> 02:14:20.430]
Now I'm playing butch boss for a little while.

[02:14:22.310 --> 02:14:24.450]
Don't you remember that when we had over there at IOD?

[02:14:24.790 --> 02:14:25.490]
Of course I did.

[02:14:25.510 --> 02:14:28.850]
If you could have seen the pictures of the stuff that they stuck out of the events in that building.

[02:14:29.670 --> 02:14:30.030]
Mountains.

[02:14:30.230 --> 02:14:31.350]
It looked like Mount Rushmore.

[02:14:31.350 --> 02:14:32.790]
Mountains of Meng.

[02:14:34.390 --> 02:14:39.570]
Huge enormous chunks of crap that have been in that building in events for like a hundred years.

[02:14:39.730 --> 02:14:41.050]
That has never been to a tall giraffe.

[02:14:41.250 --> 02:14:42.230]
Oh my god.

[02:14:42.550 --> 02:14:45.530]
And we're sitting there and everybody in the building had corporate disease at IOD.

[02:14:47.450 --> 02:14:50.390]
Coffing and teary eyes and blurry.

[02:14:50.630 --> 02:14:54.170]
And then of course when they sold us a pack and we really had teary eyes.

[02:14:55.050 --> 02:14:58.530]
Till we realized that they had much better equipment and they were going to pay me off for some months.

[02:14:58.710 --> 02:14:59.190]
And then we said.

[02:14:59.450 --> 02:14:59.850]
Oh right.

[02:14:59.850 --> 02:15:00.110]
Yeah.

[02:15:00.670 --> 02:15:02.330]
Then all of a sudden tears went away.

[02:15:02.930 --> 02:15:04.230]
Maybe there were tears of joy.

[02:15:04.490 --> 02:15:05.970]
They had a lot of good freebies at Paxington.

[02:15:06.150 --> 02:15:07.470]
Who did that song, Tears of Joy?

[02:15:10.050 --> 02:15:13.370]
How about tears for fears or tears of a clown or tears in heaven?

[02:15:13.930 --> 02:15:15.010]
Tears in heaven I like.

[02:15:16.090 --> 02:15:17.890]
Twenty till now let's do some music shows.

[02:15:17.930 --> 02:15:21.410]
Yeah just to piss off Tom who wants us to save the world from the right wing which we can't do.

[02:15:22.190 --> 02:15:22.830]
Track some of my tears.

[02:15:23.350 --> 02:15:23.690]
Smokey.

[02:15:23.870 --> 02:15:24.410]
He's smokey.

[02:15:24.590 --> 02:15:24.790]
You'd be good.

[02:15:25.370 --> 02:15:26.410]
I love Smokey Robinson.

[02:15:27.570 --> 02:15:28.430]
It's just like here.

[02:15:28.430 --> 02:15:29.350]
If you listen it's a miracle.

[02:15:29.490 --> 02:15:32.710]
I got tears in my ears from crying while I'm lying on my bed thinking to you.

[02:15:32.930 --> 02:15:34.450]

I just say that's a sympathy vote.

[02:17:10.610 --> 02:17:11.590]
Somebody go on there vote for him.

[02:17:11.750 --> 02:17:12.510]

The bagel Hi restaurant in Delhi is a real Nakhaya.

Hi, I'm a cranky homophole.

[02:19:19.230 --> 02:19:23.050]
Not that I'm minded but I'm way too old to do.

[02:19:23.330 --> 02:19:25.710]
I bet the size about being in bed.

[02:19:26.670 --> 02:19:30.810]
In a trist with feed loads my man friend did it.

[02:19:31.430 --> 02:19:34.050]
I'll just make up with Jinder some day here.

[02:19:34.510 --> 02:19:37.530]
And then ask him to rate my bun.

[02:19:39.210 --> 02:19:41.030]
Oh there's an over again.

[02:19:43.070 --> 02:19:46.510]
So I would not feel for more spoon.

[02:19:46.750 --> 02:19:47.010]
Now!

[02:19:47.510 --> 02:19:54.330]
And I would not be ashamed about a Jinder and more gay union.

[02:19:55.050 --> 02:19:57.890]
Just pull and then stroke and away.

[02:19:59.950 --> 02:20:02.570]
Boy, baby, kill me you're not my type.

[02:20:03.530 --> 02:20:03.750]
Yeah!

[02:20:04.150 --> 02:20:06.690]
You sound like a nine year old kid.

[02:20:06.970 --> 02:20:07.230]
Hey!

[02:20:08.490 --> 02:20:10.510]
Only a macho-mending guy.

[02:20:10.830 --> 02:20:11.810]
You don't know this.

[02:20:11.810 --> 02:20:14.490]
That makes me flip my wig.

[02:20:15.690 --> 02:20:18.450]
If Jinger was a lover of mine,

[02:20:19.550 --> 02:20:22.470]
I'd bury my boldest feigny nose.

[02:20:23.750 --> 02:20:26.310]
Inside his hip-bley rear end.

[02:20:27.750 --> 02:20:31.430]
No, I would not be a sport-old.

[02:20:31.650 --> 02:20:31.910]
Now!

[02:20:32.350 --> 02:20:34.830]
If I was not a closet of faith,

[02:20:36.010 --> 02:20:39.030]
That's why a Jinder and more gay union

[02:20:39.030 --> 02:20:41.790]
would make me feel guilty.

[02:20:43.670 --> 02:20:45.770]
Everybody follow my thousand pulls.

[02:20:46.030 --> 02:20:48.710]
Yeah, Jinger and more gay union.

[02:20:49.190 --> 02:20:52.650]
That would make my swirl pony ass feel safe.

[02:20:53.030 --> 02:20:53.170]
Gay.

[02:20:53.650 --> 02:20:56.810]
If we had a Jinger and more gay union,

[02:20:57.870 --> 02:21:00.030]
Then he wouldn't have to get me raped.

[02:21:00.230 --> 02:21:01.910]
I'm 48 at 56 UW-QM.

[02:21:01.910 --> 02:21:02.430]
Here's a fast.

[02:21:02.650 --> 02:21:04.070]
Now, there's some of Hyatt.

[02:21:05.310 --> 02:21:06.670]
It says his number one.

[02:21:08.130 --> 02:21:08.930]
And you say,

[02:21:10.350 --> 02:21:10.670]
Overrated.

[02:21:10.970 --> 02:21:11.230]
Okay.

[02:21:11.410 --> 02:21:12.690]
But, you know, everybody's,

[02:21:12.710 --> 02:21:13.530]
Ah, Selma, high end.

[02:21:13.630 --> 02:21:13.970]
Look for him.

[02:21:15.010 --> 02:21:16.590]
So, not on the list or you're on the list.

[02:21:16.690 --> 02:21:17.130]
On the list.

[02:21:17.350 --> 02:21:17.550]
Oh.

[02:21:17.910 --> 02:21:20.050]
Well, gee, I just threw the damn Moshmit Candid.

[02:21:21.250 --> 02:21:21.910]
How do you spell it?

[02:21:23.470 --> 02:21:24.990]
Selma, I'm a beater, Hayek.

[02:21:25.210 --> 02:21:26.110]
H-A-Y-E-K.

[02:21:27.130 --> 02:21:27.450]
Hayek.

[02:21:28.230 --> 02:21:29.830]
I thought that's something you like canoeing.

[02:21:30.950 --> 02:21:33.150]
How can you forget faith, Hill or Angeli and Jolie?

[02:21:33.310 --> 02:21:34.050]
Well, we didn't forget faith.

[02:21:34.150 --> 02:21:34.970]
We just put her on there.

[02:21:34.970 --> 02:21:35.510]
You're damn it.

[02:21:35.730 --> 02:21:36.610]
And Angeli and Jolie?

[02:21:37.450 --> 02:21:38.370]
What's upon a time?

[02:21:39.270 --> 02:21:40.470]
What, about 40-50 years ago?

[02:21:40.570 --> 02:21:41.710]
And she's got all those tattoos.

[02:21:41.830 --> 02:21:42.030]
Ah!

[02:21:42.410 --> 02:21:44.590]
Billy Bob got all over her and it...

[02:21:44.590 --> 02:21:45.650]
David says, my bad.

[02:21:46.510 --> 02:21:48.630]
Katana Baker is the brunette in the middle of my commercial.

[02:21:48.730 --> 02:21:49.430]
The mud-wrestling one.

[02:21:49.830 --> 02:21:51.050]
If that Rachel is the blonde.

[02:21:51.690 --> 02:21:54.630]
So, Katana Baker is responsibly on who those people are.

[02:21:55.490 --> 02:21:56.570]
Obscure doesn't begin.

[02:21:57.470 --> 02:21:58.690]
Just calm down, okay?

[02:21:59.090 --> 02:21:59.190]
No.

[02:21:59.810 --> 02:22:02.490]
How about playmates, Heather Kizar, or Stacey Sanchez,

[02:22:02.490 --> 02:22:03.770]
two very hot babes?

[02:22:05.850 --> 02:22:06.810]
We don't know who they are.

[02:22:06.950 --> 02:22:07.510]
Playboy playmates?

[02:22:07.850 --> 02:22:08.210]
I assume.

[02:22:09.010 --> 02:22:10.330]
It says, how about playmates?

[02:22:10.410 --> 02:22:12.230]
I don't think they're like playmates in a playpin.

[02:22:12.570 --> 02:22:13.750]
They're probably playboy playmates.

[02:22:13.870 --> 02:22:14.450]
They're hot either way.

[02:22:14.810 --> 02:22:16.090]
Maybe they're playmates like in a bedroom.

[02:22:16.290 --> 02:22:16.670]
I don't know.

[02:22:17.350 --> 02:22:18.290]
You want to go check it out?

[02:22:18.350 --> 02:22:18.490]
Yeah.

[02:22:18.710 --> 02:22:19.270]
I bet you do.

[02:22:20.090 --> 02:22:20.970]
We don't know who they are.

[02:22:21.550 --> 02:22:22.830]
Here's one that says from Lou.

[02:22:24.350 --> 02:22:27.550]
Maybe Neil likes Penelope Cruz because he knows looks like a great big penis.

[02:22:27.550 --> 02:22:28.430]
What an ugly bitch.

[02:22:28.550 --> 02:22:28.930]
There you go.

[02:22:29.090 --> 02:22:29.710]
I think, uh, yeah.

[02:22:30.170 --> 02:22:30.710]
They nailed it.

[02:22:30.710 --> 02:22:33.650]
I don't like Penelope Cruz or a big penis nose.

[02:22:33.810 --> 02:22:35.810]
Big crooked with a bump and a-

[02:22:35.810 --> 02:22:37.370]
And Carla, this is a nibbid on this.

[02:22:37.630 --> 02:22:38.670]
Exasperated with what she was saying.

[02:22:38.750 --> 02:22:39.610]
How is she doing on a bull?

[02:22:39.610 --> 02:22:40.830]
All but she's number six.

[02:22:41.350 --> 02:22:41.450]
What the heck?

[02:22:41.450 --> 02:22:43.070]
She's running a crumb and a lector's ass.

[02:22:44.390 --> 02:22:45.230]
Right on her ass.

[02:22:46.710 --> 02:22:48.030]
There's another spite vote.

[02:22:49.190 --> 02:22:49.650]
Anyway.

[02:22:50.110 --> 02:22:51.170]
Very important stuff.

[02:22:51.410 --> 02:22:52.010]
Star reports.

[02:22:53.890 --> 02:22:56.230]
The superhero series Birds of Prey May have fallen,

[02:22:56.370 --> 02:22:58.110]
but this young Superman series, Smallville,

[02:22:58.190 --> 02:22:59.390]
is still flying fairly high.

[02:22:59.390 --> 02:23:02.130]
In tonight's episode, Clark's father,

[02:23:02.610 --> 02:23:04.650]
a foster dad, Jonathan John Schneider,

[02:23:04.950 --> 02:23:06.550]
is arrested for shooting Lionel Luther.

[02:23:07.990 --> 02:23:09.750]
But a lot of people had a reason to want Luther dead,

[02:23:09.810 --> 02:23:10.630]
including his son Lex.

[02:23:11.150 --> 02:23:12.710]
Meanwhile, Lana's lawyer, dad,

[02:23:13.210 --> 02:23:14.710]
gets our Patrick Cassidy.

[02:23:16.030 --> 02:23:17.650]
Mysteriously, refuses to offend Jonathan.

[02:23:18.010 --> 02:23:19.930]
Who shot Lionel Luther is Smallville turning into?

[02:23:21.510 --> 02:23:22.450]
Dallas, it says.

[02:23:23.230 --> 02:23:24.670]
I think we do have corporate disease in here.

[02:23:24.730 --> 02:23:25.590]
Maybe it's not the iced tea.

[02:23:26.150 --> 02:23:27.330]
I'm gagging again in this room.

[02:23:29.910 --> 02:23:31.570]
What do you look at me like, I'm just telling you,

[02:23:31.730 --> 02:23:33.610]
I think we have a corporate dish, Mutzin here.

[02:23:34.230 --> 02:23:36.610]
So there's the skinny on Smallville for tonight.

[02:23:37.830 --> 02:23:39.030]
As Lionel Luther gets shot.

[02:23:40.810 --> 02:23:42.070]
He didn't see that on the previews.

[02:23:42.890 --> 02:23:45.370]
I guarantee he didn't see it coming.

[02:23:45.590 --> 02:23:46.350]
I saw the preview.

[02:23:46.950 --> 02:23:48.350]
David Brinkley sat last days.

[02:23:48.350 --> 02:23:49.850]
This is a very tragic, sad.

[02:23:51.730 --> 02:23:53.850]
A raging fire, we saw that story a couple weeks ago.

[02:23:53.970 --> 02:23:54.830]
They had a carry-em out.

[02:23:55.550 --> 02:23:56.970]
Raging fire at David Brinkley's house

[02:23:56.970 --> 02:23:58.770]
has brought an even-sadder situation to light.

[02:23:59.090 --> 02:24:01.730]
News legend, Brinkley 82, is living out his last days

[02:24:01.730 --> 02:24:03.590]
as a frailed bedridden and confused,

[02:24:03.590 --> 02:24:05.150]
invalid sources tell the star.

[02:24:05.970 --> 02:24:07.070]
That was clear to rescueers.

[02:24:07.070 --> 02:24:09.330]
They carried him to safety after a raging blaze

[02:24:09.330 --> 02:24:10.350]
early January 13.

[02:24:10.950 --> 02:24:13.510]
Destroyed his Jackson-Moyoming and vacation townhouse.

[02:24:14.850 --> 02:24:15.950]
Man, it's bad in here.

[02:24:16.470 --> 02:24:17.730]
He really didn't understand what was happening

[02:24:17.730 --> 02:24:19.130]
when I picked him up and carried him out of the bedroom.

[02:24:19.530 --> 02:24:22.790]
He said, Tate and County deputy Chad something or other,

[02:24:22.990 --> 02:24:24.270]
who was credited with saving his life.

[02:24:24.530 --> 02:24:26.670]
I was told by his caregiver he's got dementia.

[02:24:28.430 --> 02:24:30.430]
Gee, ought to be working in management here, you know what?

[02:24:30.750 --> 02:24:31.990]
Can you pick that up on purpose?

[02:24:32.670 --> 02:24:33.710]
Is there something you can take?

[02:24:36.610 --> 02:24:39.130]
Well, I tell you, it's a good thing we had this one last dive Pepsi.

[02:24:40.070 --> 02:24:40.650]
I'm serious.

[02:24:41.430 --> 02:24:42.530]
I'm gagging in this room.

[02:24:43.870 --> 02:24:45.970]
I think they got the poison gas coming in here.

[02:24:45.970 --> 02:24:48.670]
Make a must have the hose hooked up again, like the old days.

[02:24:50.830 --> 02:24:54.670]
560-560, pound 560 on the AT&T of Verizon Wireless Line.

[02:24:54.830 --> 02:24:57.570]
Many, many open lines, very sad, tragic.

[02:24:59.030 --> 02:25:01.710]
Tom's upset because we're not screaming in the out of the fascists.

[02:25:02.450 --> 02:25:03.610]
495 hosts on a pool.

[02:25:05.570 --> 02:25:07.170]
And a lot closer than I thought it would be.

[02:25:07.310 --> 02:25:09.110]
Brittany and Haley and Anna are battling it out.

[02:25:09.290 --> 02:25:11.110]
Even Elizabeth Hurley's on her ass with 49.

[02:25:11.810 --> 02:25:12.890]
She's pretty good.

[02:25:14.010 --> 02:25:14.410]
Yes.

[02:25:15.070 --> 02:25:17.470]
That is young as she used to be, but still holding up quite well.

[02:25:17.610 --> 02:25:18.550]
But then again, who is?

[02:25:19.150 --> 02:25:19.690]
Who is?

[02:25:21.670 --> 02:25:23.230]
Here's a car from the Redlands, hello.

[02:25:23.650 --> 02:25:24.390]
Booga. Booga.

[02:25:24.830 --> 02:25:25.050]
Yeah.

[02:25:25.430 --> 02:25:26.150]
That is all.

[02:25:26.390 --> 02:25:27.670]
Okay, great. Good call.

[02:25:28.890 --> 02:25:30.650]
Here's the lady in Coke and a creek. Hello.

[02:25:31.070 --> 02:25:31.930]
Hi, Neon, how you doing?

[02:25:32.050 --> 02:25:32.310]
Okay.

[02:25:32.990 --> 02:25:36.950]
I was going to say Tom Brady, but that was a while ago, so you already have him.

[02:25:37.070 --> 02:25:37.970]
I can tell you.

[02:25:39.350 --> 02:25:41.350]
I'm not giving him up.

[02:25:42.550 --> 02:25:46.210]
I think the guy you're talking about in the nearest place might be Jack Wagner.

[02:25:46.650 --> 02:25:47.330]
No, no.

[02:25:47.630 --> 02:25:48.470]
Oh, no.

[02:25:51.450 --> 02:25:55.090]
Jack Wagner from the soap opera from the General Hospital.

[02:25:55.230 --> 02:25:56.730]
Yeah, that's a great deal.

[02:25:57.110 --> 02:25:59.350]
The hospital has improved greatly over the last year.

[02:25:59.990 --> 02:26:01.190]
I don't like that show ever.

[02:26:01.530 --> 02:26:03.090]
You should never, never, ever.

[02:26:03.750 --> 02:26:05.770]
And just watch for one or two days.

[02:26:06.130 --> 02:26:06.330]
Yeah.

[02:26:06.530 --> 02:26:09.050]
There are many, many fine gentlemen on the show.

[02:26:09.050 --> 02:26:09.350]
Really?

[02:26:09.530 --> 02:26:10.310]
On General Hospital?

[02:26:10.310 --> 02:26:12.530]
Well, not a guiding lights on on a three anymore.

[02:26:12.710 --> 02:26:12.830]
Yeah.

[02:26:13.530 --> 02:26:14.150]
Who knows?

[02:26:14.210 --> 02:26:16.250]
You can just do me a favor and watch it.

[02:26:16.370 --> 02:26:17.970]
And then you can say something about it.

[02:26:17.970 --> 02:26:18.630]
I'm sure you will.

[02:26:18.790 --> 02:26:23.010]
There's maybe four or five young gentlemen on there.

[02:26:23.190 --> 02:26:23.630]
Oh, right.

[02:26:23.970 --> 02:26:24.110]
Yeah, I'm sure.

[02:26:25.450 --> 02:26:29.990]
Is there any way I could possibly make a request for tomorrow morning from 9 to 10?

[02:26:30.170 --> 02:26:30.430]
Sure.

[02:26:31.630 --> 02:26:34.130]
Prins and Bich from the front of mine.

[02:26:34.550 --> 02:26:37.010]
I can also comment on the 9 to 10.

[02:26:37.530 --> 02:26:37.690]
Yeah.

[02:26:37.690 --> 02:26:41.470]
I have been listening to you forever since the beginning IOD.

[02:26:42.010 --> 02:26:44.630]
And it was just a habit of 10 to 2.

[02:26:44.730 --> 02:26:49.030]
I really prefer 10 to 2 because I listen to Bob and Tom in the morning and I always forget.

[02:26:49.030 --> 02:26:49.470]
Good choice.

[02:26:49.710 --> 02:26:50.030]
Good taste.

[02:26:50.490 --> 02:26:51.950]
You know, they come in all the way.

[02:26:52.110 --> 02:26:55.210]
I listen to them all through Fort Lauderdale and all around.

[02:26:55.310 --> 02:26:56.370]
I do a little bit of delivery driver.

[02:26:56.530 --> 02:26:57.950]
I hear them most of the morning.

[02:26:58.230 --> 02:26:58.350]
Right.

[02:26:58.590 --> 02:27:01.590]
But I can't get in the habit of turning you on at 9 o'clock.

[02:27:01.730 --> 02:27:04.310]
And I just, so you see you 10 to 2 that I have been doing.

[02:27:04.310 --> 02:27:06.450]
And I've been doing a bad, bad mistake here.

[02:27:06.450 --> 02:27:10.450]
He tried to patch up another day part with his strongest day part and he took the franchise

[02:27:10.450 --> 02:27:11.710]
and he's chopping it apart.

[02:27:12.070 --> 02:27:14.790]
And he just doesn't use his being if he's got one.

[02:27:14.910 --> 02:27:17.510]
He just did over the show and we should never have permitted him to do it.

[02:27:17.650 --> 02:27:21.370]
And now he's got this dilemma because we got the mad dog doing great between 1 and 3.

[02:27:21.750 --> 02:27:23.170]
And how do we put the pieces back together?

[02:27:23.350 --> 02:27:23.970]
I have no idea.

[02:27:24.550 --> 02:27:24.810]
Yeah.

[02:27:24.990 --> 02:27:30.410]
Well, it's because it was a habit and it's hard to change but I've got to get used to turning it over to you.

[02:27:30.530 --> 02:27:31.510]
But I like Bob and Tom.

[02:27:31.510 --> 02:27:32.430]
I like you better.

[02:27:33.270 --> 02:27:33.270]

[02:27:33.270 --> 02:27:37.990]
But it's just, um, you can find more Bob and Tom bits like prison bits between 9 and 10.

[02:27:37.990 --> 02:27:38.970]
You'll think you're listening to them.

[02:27:39.190 --> 02:27:44.730]
Yeah, prison bits would be great for my friend Rick who's laying in Miami right now and, um, it's a hell.

[02:27:44.850 --> 02:27:45.070]
Okay.

[02:27:45.170 --> 02:27:46.310]
But I appreciate it, Neil.

[02:27:46.610 --> 02:27:47.010]
See ya.

[02:27:47.370 --> 02:27:47.970]
Thanks, bye.

[02:27:48.110 --> 02:27:48.430]
Thank you.

[02:27:50.090 --> 02:27:53.050]
What was the name of the time restaurant in Miami in the mid 60s?

[02:27:53.050 --> 02:27:54.550]
It made a great, uh, oh yeah, that's cute.

[02:27:54.550 --> 02:27:56.250]
Ah, you're cute.

[02:27:58.110 --> 02:27:59.810]
Very, very sick on a fax machine.

[02:27:59.970 --> 02:28:02.910]
And you remember, I made that comment and now they're all, it's like an invitation.

[02:28:04.130 --> 02:28:04.930]
Just spewing.

[02:28:05.110 --> 02:28:06.770]
I'm on a fax machine.

[02:28:08.890 --> 02:28:11.210]
And you wonder when you're out there driving what's going on?

[02:28:11.470 --> 02:28:12.090]
No, I don't.

[02:28:12.190 --> 02:28:13.850]
Oh no, you just know where you are.

[02:28:14.770 --> 02:28:15.770]
You know where you are.

[02:28:16.650 --> 02:28:22.270]
In fact, since I've been back, if I'm in a car with somebody else driving, I have a fit.

[02:28:22.270 --> 02:28:27.310]
Because I can't, I can't stand it because in fact, when somebody else is driving, you can get to more chance to pay better retention.

[02:28:27.530 --> 02:28:29.150]
But all the stuff that's going on around you, right?

[02:28:29.190 --> 02:28:30.590]
And you see all the crazy people out there.

[02:28:31.150 --> 02:28:34.890]
And then they go home and they go to their fax machine and they fax us on the show.

[02:28:35.630 --> 02:28:36.350]
Like that.

[02:28:37.150 --> 02:28:40.590]
Jenna Jamison has made some more men hit the scene than anyone on your list.

[02:28:40.730 --> 02:28:41.550]
Who's Jenna Jamison?

[02:28:42.890 --> 02:28:44.110]
Joe is a big fan of hers.

[02:28:44.330 --> 02:28:44.790]
Talks about it.

[02:28:44.790 --> 02:28:49.230]
Well, when Carlos is shaking his head, you look like, like Linda Blair, it's spun around all the way one time.

[02:28:49.390 --> 02:28:49.750]
Poor star.

[02:28:50.010 --> 02:28:50.510]
Popular one.

[02:28:50.510 --> 02:28:51.090]
Yeah.

[02:28:52.310 --> 02:28:59.250]
And with Carmen Electra on, there's only, you know, just what there's, it's only, I don't understand what Carmen Electra on there.

[02:28:59.370 --> 02:29:02.350]
It's only just unless you know if Ron Jeremy has been there, then forget it.

[02:29:03.090 --> 02:29:08.150]
In other words, if we can have a skank or like Carmen Electra on there, we can have a poor star like Jenna Jamison on there.

[02:29:08.250 --> 02:29:08.450]
Yeah.

[02:29:09.210 --> 02:29:10.890]
Well, why can't a poor star be on there?

[02:29:11.290 --> 02:29:11.790]
Sure they can.

[02:29:12.570 --> 02:29:14.010]
She certainly qualifies if you can.

[02:29:14.010 --> 02:29:14.310]
Okay.

[02:29:14.870 --> 02:29:17.190]
Jenna Jamison, I'm sure this is not spelled correctly.

[02:29:17.430 --> 02:29:19.310]
He's got J-A-M-E-S-O-N.

[02:29:20.250 --> 02:29:21.490]
Isn't it probably with an eye?

[02:29:22.270 --> 02:29:23.250]
No, I think that's right.

[02:29:24.150 --> 02:29:24.630]
Are you sure?

[02:29:25.890 --> 02:29:27.610]
J-A-M-E-S-O-N?

[02:29:27.730 --> 02:29:28.150]
Are you sure?

[02:29:28.470 --> 02:29:28.990]
I'm pretty sure.

[02:29:29.270 --> 02:29:30.190]
Okay, I'll put it down.

[02:29:30.650 --> 02:29:31.670]
What's all the wine owe from that?

[02:29:32.670 --> 02:29:33.570]
Okay, so there you go.

[02:29:33.690 --> 02:29:34.730]
We got the list and it's expanding.

[02:29:34.730 --> 02:29:35.850]
It's growing the noon to one hour.

[02:29:35.970 --> 02:29:37.970]
We're going to talk about the fascists controlling the government.

[02:29:38.030 --> 02:29:38.890]
Anybody believe that?

[02:29:38.930 --> 02:29:39.070]
No.

[02:29:39.250 --> 02:29:39.350]
No.

[02:29:40.670 --> 02:29:42.010]
Every time I get a facts like that.

[02:29:42.010 --> 02:29:43.850]
No, gee, you're like caving it in your right.

[02:29:44.990 --> 02:29:46.230]
Just go to our website.

[02:29:46.470 --> 02:29:47.290]
Okay, do a little bit of reading.

[02:29:47.310 --> 02:29:48.490]
Find out what else is really going on.

[02:29:48.590 --> 02:29:48.770]
Okay.

[02:29:49.150 --> 02:29:50.030]
About the Goof Stepers.

[02:29:51.530 --> 02:29:53.510]
11.57 at 5.60 WQM.

[02:29:53.590 --> 02:29:55.670]
For the past few weeks, you've heard us talk about Flores Pizza.

[02:29:55.830 --> 02:29:58.230]
The freshest, most delicious Italian food in a long time.

[02:29:58.710 --> 02:30:00.630]
And Judy brought us food from Flores for lunch last week.

[02:30:00.630 --> 02:30:01.850]
It's absolutely better than ever.

[02:30:02.270 --> 02:30:03.190]
The sauce was incredible.

[02:30:03.370 --> 02:30:03.710]
It's true.

[02:30:03.770 --> 02:30:05.030]
Nothing comes out of the can in Flores.

[02:30:05.330 --> 02:30:08.110]
You can tell that just by the just made fresh taste from the sauce.

[02:30:08.650 --> 02:30:11.290]
Oh, you know, this PD Lenny, I'm going to tell you something.

[02:30:11.290 --> 02:30:14.170]
If I had a two by four, it wouldn't be good enough.

[02:30:14.270 --> 02:30:15.310]
Just to beat the crap out of him.

[02:30:15.410 --> 02:30:18.430]
The copy, you can't complain about his copy because he doesn't give you any.

[02:30:18.830 --> 02:30:20.410]
Anyway, they have first they made pizza.

[02:30:20.410 --> 02:30:23.470]
Don't fresh baked garlic rolls that they bake right there on a spotted Flores.

[02:30:23.850 --> 02:30:24.650]
The portions are gigantic.

[02:30:24.650 --> 02:30:27.530]
They use more cheese and meats on their pies than anybody else in town.

[02:30:27.930 --> 02:30:29.790]
George Miguel thought the food was delicious too.

[02:30:30.050 --> 02:30:31.350]
Didn't George think that was delicious?

[02:30:31.370 --> 02:30:31.370]

[02:30:31.370 --> 02:30:31.530]
Yes.

[02:30:31.830 --> 02:30:32.330]
Everybody thought that.

[02:30:32.390 --> 02:30:34.070]
In fact, he's got everybody in the nation on here.

[02:30:34.490 --> 02:30:38.290]
You'll be fighting for that last slice of pizzas as PD Lenny fits from Flores.

[02:30:38.350 --> 02:30:39.530]
But don't take my word for it.

[02:30:39.530 --> 02:30:41.870]
Fight out from PD Lenny because he's the pizza maven.

[02:30:42.310 --> 02:30:50.870]
Go to 731 North East 79th Street Art Fiskane Boulevard or call Flores at 305 758 503 51 758 553 51 to get delivery.

[02:30:51.090 --> 02:30:54.250]
They deliver from 34th and Biscayne all the way to 135th and Biscayne.

[02:30:54.370 --> 02:30:56.410]
They'll go to Quasad, Cricket Club, the Jackie Club.

[02:30:56.710 --> 02:30:59.710]
Flores even delivers this far west of 12th Avenue east of Collins 71st.

[02:30:59.850 --> 02:31:00.350]
So call him.

[02:31:00.550 --> 02:31:05.050]
If you're nice to a little Judy, she'll tell you about the great pizza specials like 1399 for a large cheese pie.

[02:31:05.050 --> 02:31:08.010]
The five liter of soda and six delicious chicken wings call Flores right now.

[02:31:08.030 --> 02:31:17.230]
I tell him that PD Lenny writes the worst copy in the history of broadcasting 305 758 503 51 that's 305 755 553 51.

[02:31:17.570 --> 02:31:21.510]
Tell him that Neil and PD Lenny sent you by to Flores one of the real survivors in South Florida.

[02:31:22.710 --> 02:31:24.750]
Do you know what that means?

[02:31:24.750 --> 02:31:26.470]
This is sports when you'll buy city.

[02:31:26.470 --> 02:31:36.530]
I am my favorite Republican, this is Madronge, and it's time for the real Excuse-Man uploading.

[02:31:37.670 --> 02:31:41.050]
It's time once again for the Neil Rogers 12-Dewa-Dower.

[02:31:43.990 --> 02:31:46.070]
New from Time Likeless Music.

[02:31:47.110 --> 02:31:50.630]
It's the synatra compilation that buries the competition home.

[02:31:50.630 --> 02:31:54.850]
Die with me, let's die, let's die away.

[02:31:56.590 --> 02:32:03.470]
I sure could use some soccer for goose, because I'll be dead any day.

[02:32:04.150 --> 02:32:08.030]
Come die with me, let's die, let's die away.

[02:32:08.510 --> 02:32:13.390]
Don't miss out on the last collection of hits from old blue eyes before the maggots get to him.

[02:32:14.410 --> 02:32:21.990]
Start digging a hole, because I'll die any day.

[02:32:23.390 --> 02:32:31.390]
I'll be a cool cadabaret, new corpse, new corpse.

[02:32:31.950 --> 02:32:34.450]
Frank Sinatra's greatest hit, the final chapter.

[02:32:34.810 --> 02:32:37.790]
Yes, the chairman of the board with a fond final farewell.

[02:32:39.010 --> 02:32:42.390]
Rigger Mordus, Rigger Mordus.

[02:32:42.710 --> 02:32:49.630]
I'll be stiff for them to bypass, ask the Undertaker.

[02:32:50.590 --> 02:32:54.010]
The say I've gone to meet my maker.

[02:32:54.690 --> 02:32:57.610]
The order has credit card ready and call 1-800-Cadabaret.

[02:32:57.850 --> 02:32:59.270]
That's 1-800-Cadabaret.

[02:32:59.630 --> 02:33:01.330]
Order today before it's too late.

[02:33:02.290 --> 02:33:03.350]
It's too late.

[02:33:05.690 --> 02:33:07.530]
Take a look at that beautiful thing off the facts.

[02:33:08.670 --> 02:33:13.250]
It's black, it's something, it's like a naked body with a Catholic penis.

[02:33:13.630 --> 02:33:15.130]
I wonder who she is.

[02:33:15.610 --> 02:33:19.610]
5-670560-0.560 on the 18 and T in Verizon Wireless Lines.

[02:33:19.830 --> 02:33:21.430]
Who is the hottest person in the world today?

[02:33:21.830 --> 02:33:23.690]
Living or close to it?

[02:33:24.310 --> 02:33:31.450]
Got a long list including Jenna Jameson, Sama Hayak, Faith Hill, Monica Balucci.

[02:33:32.610 --> 02:33:35.010]
I think Jamie Presley is hotter than the others in your pool.

[02:33:35.070 --> 02:33:37.850]
It says here and you say she's hot.

[02:33:38.710 --> 02:33:39.550]
So why isn't she on there?

[02:33:40.690 --> 02:33:43.030]
Spelled wrong, can't be J-A-I-M-E.

[02:33:43.390 --> 02:33:44.110]
It is.

[02:33:46.250 --> 02:33:47.310]
How do you know?

[02:33:48.150 --> 02:33:49.310]
Carlos does these things.

[02:33:49.550 --> 02:33:50.630]
Jaime Presley?

[02:33:52.470 --> 02:33:53.270]
Jamie Presley.

[02:33:53.490 --> 02:33:54.010]
Is it Jamie?

[02:33:55.210 --> 02:33:56.150]
What kind of a spelling is that?

[02:33:56.250 --> 02:33:57.710]
She really looks great but she can't spell.

[02:33:57.910 --> 02:33:58.930]
Of course who the hell gives a crap.

[02:33:59.950 --> 02:34:03.010]
Natasha Hensridge from the species movies?

[02:34:03.530 --> 02:34:04.250]
Yeah, she's hot.

[02:34:04.430 --> 02:34:05.630]
She used to be a model and then she started to get into the movies.

[02:34:05.690 --> 02:34:10.050]
She's an awful lot of hot people out there and not too many people down here getting the hold of them.

[02:34:12.810 --> 02:34:13.610]
Natasha Hensridge.

[02:34:14.450 --> 02:34:15.910]
I thought kind of a name is that.

[02:34:16.210 --> 02:34:16.370]
Weird.

[02:34:17.810 --> 02:34:18.530]
Natasha Hensridge.

[02:34:18.970 --> 02:34:21.810]
I thought she was in Rocky and Bullwinkle from the species movies.

[02:34:23.010 --> 02:34:23.370]
Yes.

[02:34:25.390 --> 02:34:26.410]
She was the species.

[02:34:27.330 --> 02:34:27.690]
Uh-huh.

[02:34:28.090 --> 02:34:29.390]
Okay, Jamie Presley, we got your message.

[02:34:29.530 --> 02:34:30.210]
Wait till you hear this one.

[02:34:30.290 --> 02:34:31.210]
You're going to puke your guts out.

[02:34:31.290 --> 02:34:32.030]
I don't think we need lunch.

[02:34:34.310 --> 02:34:38.130]
Richard says Richard must have either a great sense of humor or visually impaired.

[02:34:39.050 --> 02:34:41.330]
Hi Neil, what about Anne Coulter that right wing bitch?

[02:34:41.510 --> 02:34:42.190]
She's kind of hot.

[02:34:43.790 --> 02:34:47.350]
You know, I don't think I've ever seen her or a picture or anything.

[02:34:47.650 --> 02:34:48.790]
You've never seen her?

[02:34:48.990 --> 02:34:49.290]
Nope.

[02:34:51.710 --> 02:34:52.270]
Nope.

[02:34:52.750 --> 02:34:53.690]
Oh, I see her.

[02:34:54.490 --> 02:34:58.430]
She makes Christina look like Rosie O'Donnell.

[02:34:58.550 --> 02:35:00.190]
Christina the Spanish talk show hostess.

[02:35:01.470 --> 02:35:02.590]
Christina Aguilar.

[02:35:02.750 --> 02:35:04.250]
Oh, and that one too.

[02:35:05.590 --> 02:35:07.190]
Like Miss Twiggy is what she's like.

[02:35:08.270 --> 02:35:11.550]
A nasty, nasty, ready looking, scrawny bitch.

[02:35:13.230 --> 02:35:17.610]
In other words, her looks, I'll write in there with her personality and her politics.

[02:35:19.390 --> 02:35:24.810]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T and Verizon Line.

[02:35:25.110 --> 02:35:26.430]
I better take an allegory and know it.

[02:35:27.870 --> 02:35:29.510]
As soon as I get home, I'm popping an allegory.

[02:35:30.410 --> 02:35:31.670]
The allergies in this room.

[02:35:32.250 --> 02:35:34.090]
I think we're being like bombarded.

[02:35:34.090 --> 02:35:37.070]
Maybe we better get one of those negative ion machines in here in this studio.

[02:35:39.750 --> 02:35:40.470]
Don't you think?

[02:35:40.990 --> 02:35:41.670]
That sounds pretty negative.

[02:35:42.870 --> 02:35:43.950]
Here's a call from Jupiter.

[02:35:44.150 --> 02:35:44.290]
Hello.

[02:35:45.170 --> 02:35:45.590]
Jupiter?

[02:35:46.030 --> 02:35:46.410]
Yes, sir.

[02:35:47.470 --> 02:35:49.930]
Heather Graham and Denise Richards.

[02:35:51.390 --> 02:35:51.810]
Okay.

[02:35:52.570 --> 02:35:53.590]
You put them on the list?

[02:35:53.910 --> 02:35:54.330]
Yes, sir.

[02:35:55.110 --> 02:35:55.450]
All right.

[02:35:55.630 --> 02:35:56.450]
Your wishes are command.

[02:35:57.170 --> 02:35:57.810]
Thank you very much.

[02:35:58.210 --> 02:35:58.370]
Okay.

[02:35:58.650 --> 02:35:59.090]
Now, who are they?

[02:35:59.310 --> 02:36:00.490]
Bob Graham, right.

[02:36:01.270 --> 02:36:01.950]
And Keith Richards.

[02:36:01.950 --> 02:36:02.730]
Is it Graham?

[02:36:05.230 --> 02:36:05.550]
Yes.

[02:36:05.710 --> 02:36:06.510]
And like the cracker.

[02:36:07.450 --> 02:36:08.250]
She's a cracker.

[02:36:08.650 --> 02:36:09.310]
And Denise Richards.

[02:36:10.110 --> 02:36:10.290]
Jess.

[02:36:10.530 --> 02:36:11.850]
Is she a kinder Renee Richards?

[02:36:13.290 --> 02:36:13.650]
I'll crack.

[02:36:14.030 --> 02:36:15.090]
Or maybe Henri were shard.

[02:36:15.570 --> 02:36:17.670]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60.

[02:36:17.870 --> 02:36:18.970]
That's a big panther all started.

[02:36:19.230 --> 02:36:21.210]
I mean, the National Hockey League All-Star Game come up Sunday.

[02:36:21.370 --> 02:36:21.890]
Am I going to be there?

[02:36:21.930 --> 02:36:22.090]
No.

[02:36:22.190 --> 02:36:22.630]
No, no interest.

[02:36:23.050 --> 02:36:25.510]
All these other festivities, all this stuff is open to the public.

[02:36:25.510 --> 02:36:26.110]
Am I going to be there?

[02:36:26.150 --> 02:36:26.310]
No.

[02:36:26.410 --> 02:36:26.950]
Couldn't care less.

[02:36:28.350 --> 02:36:29.650]
I don't go to watch sufficient games.

[02:36:29.790 --> 02:36:31.930]
I don't go to games where there's no checking, no hitting, no nuts.

[02:36:31.930 --> 02:36:33.810]
And there'll be some big names there, no mario.

[02:36:34.530 --> 02:36:36.270]
Good news is, all the yokanans are going to be there.

[02:36:36.310 --> 02:36:36.490]
Oh!

[02:36:36.850 --> 02:36:37.450]
In place of murder.

[02:36:37.570 --> 02:36:38.190]
And I's going, Oli.

[02:36:38.810 --> 02:36:39.390]
Well deserved.

[02:36:41.630 --> 02:36:42.790]
You know who he is, don't you?

[02:36:42.950 --> 02:36:43.470]
All the yokanans?

[02:36:44.210 --> 02:36:45.910]
Hey, Oli, you're supposed to be from Finland.

[02:36:46.110 --> 02:36:47.470]
They're teaching English in the schools there.

[02:36:47.690 --> 02:36:49.270]
How come you can't speak English properly yet?

[02:36:49.350 --> 02:36:50.530]
Oli, like, ten words will be good.

[02:36:52.250 --> 02:36:53.090]
But we'll take it.

[02:36:53.270 --> 02:36:54.530]
He can stick the biscuit in the basket.

[02:36:54.530 --> 02:36:55.530]
And that's what the panthers need.

[02:36:56.890 --> 02:36:57.510]
Lot of excitement.

[02:36:57.510 --> 02:36:58.470]
And how can't you feel it?

[02:36:58.610 --> 02:36:58.770]
No.

[02:36:58.870 --> 02:36:59.190]
Smell it.

[02:36:59.250 --> 02:36:59.390]
No.

[02:37:00.270 --> 02:37:02.350]
And I notice under the penalty of death probably,

[02:37:02.770 --> 02:37:04.150]
Gildi doing the show solo this morning,

[02:37:04.550 --> 02:37:07.330]
not too much hockey talk under this morning, very, very little.

[02:37:07.890 --> 02:37:09.450]
Sticking with that football format.

[02:37:09.710 --> 02:37:10.410]
A little bit of basketball.

[02:37:10.750 --> 02:37:12.910]
How the heat keeps getting the screw with these bad calls.

[02:37:13.330 --> 02:37:14.930]
Pat Roddy's screwed because they don't like him anymore.

[02:37:15.050 --> 02:37:15.810]
Yadi, yadi, yadi, all that.

[02:37:16.070 --> 02:37:17.770]
I'd have thought he'd would have taken the opportunity.

[02:37:18.070 --> 02:37:18.230]
No.

[02:37:19.450 --> 02:37:21.970]
But he took the opportunity to like to plug our show couple of times.

[02:37:22.850 --> 02:37:24.730]
Is that he must be really grown a big pair.

[02:37:25.570 --> 02:37:28.050]
And, concerning with me and the hallway out there with that food.

[02:37:28.750 --> 02:37:29.750]
Oh, and you know what I think?

[02:37:30.490 --> 02:37:32.470]
Now I'm starting to think about this frog in my throat,

[02:37:32.470 --> 02:37:33.530]
all these things that are going on.

[02:37:33.830 --> 02:37:34.510]
That's sandwich.

[02:37:35.230 --> 02:37:35.230]

[02:37:35.350 --> 02:37:35.870]
Grilled cheese.

[02:37:36.130 --> 02:37:36.150]
Grilled cheese.

[02:37:36.150 --> 02:37:37.790]
Not just with butter.

[02:37:37.890 --> 02:37:38.730]
Who knows what was on it?

[02:37:39.390 --> 02:37:40.190]
Had my name on it.

[02:37:40.230 --> 02:37:40.870]
But it had larger.

[02:37:41.330 --> 02:37:41.650]
No.

[02:37:41.810 --> 02:37:44.490]
It might have had like arsenic and olease without the olease.

[02:37:46.010 --> 02:37:47.930]
What better way to like, you know, leave something like that

[02:37:47.930 --> 02:37:49.170]
and not be here on that day.

[02:37:49.290 --> 02:37:49.590]
You know what I'm saying?

[02:37:50.370 --> 02:37:52.790]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, 0, 0, 5, 60.

[02:37:53.050 --> 02:37:55.450]
On the AT&T and Verizon, wireless line.

[02:37:55.470 --> 02:37:56.970]
There's only one person we can call and get through

[02:37:56.970 --> 02:37:57.670]
and we'll answer on it.

[02:37:57.690 --> 02:37:58.210]
Oh, it's not.

[02:37:58.330 --> 02:37:58.770]
Yeah, he'll know.

[02:38:00.950 --> 02:38:01.890]
Britney's got 67.

[02:38:02.090 --> 02:38:03.330]
Howley Berry's got 59.

[02:38:03.930 --> 02:38:05.110]
Howley Berry is beautiful.

[02:38:05.330 --> 02:38:06.670]
She's just very beautiful.

[02:38:07.430 --> 02:38:10.190]
But to put her in the same category with Britney Spears,

[02:38:10.370 --> 02:38:11.710]
I find abhorrent.

[02:38:12.730 --> 02:38:13.770]
You don't agree with me?

[02:38:14.790 --> 02:38:15.570]
Okay, it's special.

[02:38:16.650 --> 02:38:18.990]
Especially in like, now maybe I'm a little bit jaded.

[02:38:19.390 --> 02:38:19.630]
There are great.

[02:38:19.630 --> 02:38:19.890]
Yeah, no.

[02:38:19.950 --> 02:38:22.150]
Jaded as Steve Hatter would say to his daughter, Liv.

[02:38:23.230 --> 02:38:25.170]
Because I'm looking at these pictures on the star.

[02:38:25.170 --> 02:38:26.970]
And you can make anybody look on flattering.

[02:38:26.970 --> 02:38:29.010]
And obviously they've taken pictures of Howley when she,

[02:38:29.190 --> 02:38:30.370]
she looked like Howley.

[02:38:30.390 --> 02:38:30.610]
Right.

[02:38:30.730 --> 02:38:33.790]
I mean, boy, you might not have had a good sleep.

[02:38:33.870 --> 02:38:34.730]
I mean, look at that.

[02:38:34.850 --> 02:38:35.210]
I understand.

[02:38:35.910 --> 02:38:36.770]
She's having a rough day.

[02:38:37.410 --> 02:38:38.570]
I'm not saying she's smelly.

[02:38:38.570 --> 02:38:40.230]
You know, a shower, you know, perks people up.

[02:38:40.650 --> 02:38:42.210]
Gets the blood pumping in your face.

[02:38:42.490 --> 02:38:42.690]
Yeah.

[02:38:43.350 --> 02:38:46.810]
But we have way greater discrepancies on that list than Howley and Brittany.

[02:38:47.490 --> 02:38:50.210]
Like humans and karma and electric.

[02:38:50.470 --> 02:38:51.090]
And humanoids.

[02:38:51.850 --> 02:38:53.970]
Are you picking on poor karma and electric again?

[02:38:55.270 --> 02:38:55.630]
Soiled.

[02:38:57.170 --> 02:38:57.530]
Tainted.

[02:39:00.390 --> 02:39:01.990]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[02:39:02.530 --> 02:39:03.950]
Pound 5, 60 on the 18th.

[02:39:03.950 --> 02:39:06.270]
One, the trail leaving and Verizon wireless line.

[02:39:07.910 --> 02:39:10.330]
You must have some bug up your ass about Penelope Cruz.

[02:39:10.530 --> 02:39:11.770]
Maybe you got Penelope up your ass.

[02:39:11.870 --> 02:39:12.330]
Maybe that knows.

[02:39:13.310 --> 02:39:13.530]
Oh.

[02:39:14.450 --> 02:39:15.310]
Just a thotter.

[02:39:15.410 --> 02:39:17.330]
Maybe you, maybe I don't want to talk about eating ass.

[02:39:17.450 --> 02:39:18.090]
I would need stifles.

[02:39:18.090 --> 02:39:19.110]
I'll leave that to you in Dwight.

[02:39:19.410 --> 02:39:20.230]
Here's Pember Pine.

[02:39:20.370 --> 02:39:20.550]
Hello.

[02:39:21.510 --> 02:39:22.110]
Yeah, me.

[02:39:22.370 --> 02:39:22.770]
Yes, sir.

[02:39:23.210 --> 02:39:23.910]
Yes, sir.

[02:39:23.910 --> 02:39:24.710]
Rita and Venus.

[02:39:24.950 --> 02:39:25.770]
Venus and Sir Rita.

[02:39:25.770 --> 02:39:27.630]
Bad, bad, bad, bad, Fony voice.

[02:39:28.250 --> 02:39:29.090]
Put them on the list.

[02:39:29.150 --> 02:39:29.810]
Bad, Fony voice.

[02:39:30.470 --> 02:39:31.370]
Put it on the list.

[02:39:35.010 --> 02:39:35.370]
Lies.

[02:39:35.510 --> 02:39:36.030]
Oh man, baby.

[02:39:36.150 --> 02:39:38.230]
6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[02:39:38.750 --> 02:39:40.370]
Pound 5, 60 on the 18th.

[02:39:40.550 --> 02:39:41.230]
And figure that out.

[02:39:41.350 --> 02:39:43.330]
You're real men out there with Slusis last loser out.

[02:39:44.110 --> 02:39:46.010]
Join George Semar for a happy hour treasure island.

[02:39:46.170 --> 02:39:46.930]
And we'll see you every other week.

[02:39:47.030 --> 02:39:48.510]
Usually on Wednesday, last week on a Thursday.

[02:39:48.510 --> 02:39:49.410]
I'm not really sure why.

[02:39:49.910 --> 02:39:52.110]
One was it because the feature couldn't show up until 30.

[02:39:52.710 --> 02:39:55.250]
We wait for the game from all we're hearing it was well worth waiting for.

[02:39:55.590 --> 02:39:56.290]
Okay, everybody have it.

[02:39:56.350 --> 02:39:57.030]
You didn't do martial arts.

[02:39:57.670 --> 02:39:58.570]
I popping time.

[02:39:58.590 --> 02:39:59.230]
I'll do other arts.

[02:39:59.490 --> 02:39:59.490]

[02:39:59.490 --> 02:40:00.690]
Probably was pretty pissed off about that.

[02:40:00.970 --> 02:40:01.430]
And art too.

[02:40:01.930 --> 02:40:03.810]
But nevertheless, she did everybody else is what I'm here.

[02:40:04.630 --> 02:40:05.650]
And maybe you'll get done too.

[02:40:05.750 --> 02:40:06.350]
Maybe you'll get lucky.

[02:40:06.570 --> 02:40:11.050]
Maybe a good chance to see Carlos chasing Fat Boy around as he waddles trying to get away on his walker.

[02:40:11.430 --> 02:40:12.590]
It's a beautiful thing to watch.

[02:40:13.730 --> 02:40:15.410]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[02:40:15.610 --> 02:40:18.650]
Well, he's still warm kind of, you know, except that he's pants a lot.

[02:40:19.770 --> 02:40:20.690]
This is what I'm hearing.

[02:40:22.290 --> 02:40:25.010]
10 past noon at 5, 60, WQM, the mad dog.

[02:40:25.010 --> 02:40:26.590]
He's slightly poor.

[02:40:26.850 --> 02:40:30.750]
They were really slicing him up a little bit yesterday just because he picked a wrong team two years in a row.

[02:40:31.750 --> 02:40:36.150]
And like I said, because you played the game, doesn't make you an expert.

[02:40:36.290 --> 02:40:36.970]
We love the mad dog.

[02:40:36.990 --> 02:40:39.210]
He's kicking ass on that show, et cetera, and so on.

[02:40:39.350 --> 02:40:43.250]
But because you played the game, doesn't mean you really understand it.

[02:40:43.270 --> 02:40:44.130]
That you can be objective.

[02:40:46.650 --> 02:40:48.930]
John Madden, by the way, has got David Brinkley syndrome.

[02:40:50.310 --> 02:40:51.030]
Like that.

[02:40:51.250 --> 02:40:52.370]
Oh, that was so bad.

[02:40:53.050 --> 02:40:56.390]
I thought L. Michaels and John Madden was going to be the greatest broadcasting team in this video.

[02:40:57.150 --> 02:41:02.130]
And they might have been like 10 years ago before John completely lost any semblance of irrationality.

[02:41:03.570 --> 02:41:07.610]
And there's Al trying to bring him back to his senses like, well, he didn't have any time outslifed there.

[02:41:07.670 --> 02:41:11.370]
So really wouldn't make any difference, but there won't be any free kick yet.

[02:41:12.730 --> 02:41:18.050]
And instead of just saying, I screwed up or just shutting up, he continued and then went that way to the whole game.

[02:41:18.690 --> 02:41:19.570]
Poor John Madden.

[02:41:20.870 --> 02:41:24.550]
And it said, and this is what happens when the economy goes down my hand basket.

[02:41:24.890 --> 02:41:28.990]
And people we thought were wealthy and could go on for the rest of their lives have to keep working until they croak.

[02:41:29.510 --> 02:41:30.610]
That's the bush effing way.

[02:41:32.110 --> 02:41:33.350]
That should make Tom happy.

[02:41:33.430 --> 02:41:36.330]
Now don't you think Tom, that's something that thanks about the right way.

[02:41:36.390 --> 02:41:37.110]
We got to be real happy.

[02:41:38.410 --> 02:41:40.510]
Next, we're going to be working on, yeah.

[02:41:40.510 --> 02:41:41.870]
Wait till she gets it.

[02:41:43.050 --> 02:41:43.990]
Delights to us, welcome.

[02:41:44.170 --> 02:41:47.350]
Megastore for the Atkins, Dead Rain and Low Carb Sugar Free Died is a pleasure going to love shopping.

[02:41:47.490 --> 02:41:50.990]
And because they're whole stories for you, they have you especially in mind.

[02:41:51.370 --> 02:41:53.990]
Because they've got over 600 delicious low carb food products.

I mean, you can go into your supermarket and get your meat and cheese and seafood and your seafood meat and cheese.

[02:41:58.450 --> 02:42:00.950]
But what about the rest of the stuff to keep you on a straight and narrow path?

[02:42:01.430 --> 02:42:06.550]
And Delights this week try the new Enchanted Low Carb Cookies and six delicious flavors, only one or two carbs per cookie.

So whether it's the delicious carbolite ice cream, breads, chips, muffins, cheesecakes, pasta and sauces, whatever you like.

[02:42:14.950 --> 02:42:17.930]

[02:42:18.230 --> 02:42:19.210]
How many stores let you do that?

[02:42:19.490 --> 02:42:20.610]
Well they let you do that in pubics?

[02:42:20.730 --> 02:42:20.850]
No!

[02:42:21.010 --> 02:42:21.650]
I don't think so.

[02:42:22.190 --> 02:42:24.470]
They got an knowledgeable stuff that knows their stuff inside and out.

[02:42:24.470 --> 02:42:26.870]
They're open every day of your life, seven days a week from 10 to 10.

[02:42:27.070 --> 02:42:30.530]
And at Delights you'll find the most complete line of Atkins brand products anywhere.

[02:42:30.930 --> 02:42:32.730]
And the best part of the whole deal is you save money.

[02:42:32.730 --> 02:42:37.710]
Because they're priced 25% off all day every day on Atkins products, the books, the vitamins, everything.

[02:42:37.950 --> 02:42:40.990]
But now you heard the reports and fact Dr. Bob was on CNN this morning again going,

[02:43:20.210 --> 02:43:27.430]
I don't hear anything to you. Oh, sir, okay, there we go. I think we're all crumbling out of the pressure, or maybe it's only me

[02:43:27.430 --> 02:43:33.910]
I have a goal. This is the way to the best way to win, yeah

[02:43:35.390 --> 02:43:37.070]
And do I like that?

[02:43:47.410 --> 02:43:55.890]
When the squad aback it's lonely, he likes receivers that are wise.

[02:43:55.890 --> 02:43:57.710]
A rat!

[02:43:58.250 --> 02:44:01.930]
Some people say that number eight is gay.

[02:44:02.330 --> 02:44:02.590]
Sure.

[02:44:03.190 --> 02:44:06.090]
They say Troy loves the big brown eye.

[02:44:06.750 --> 02:44:08.030]
A-ake man.

[02:44:09.070 --> 02:44:09.230]
Yep.

[02:44:10.030 --> 02:44:13.090]
He goes down on his knees, A-ake man.

[02:44:14.830 --> 02:44:18.250]
It's guy he likes to please A-ake man.

[02:44:19.830 --> 02:44:23.390]
He loves to snap cowboys on their behind.

[02:44:23.390 --> 02:44:25.170]
Back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back to him.

[02:44:28.170 --> 02:44:31.670]
He's got a spot to spare pétation.

[02:44:33.910 --> 02:44:35.970]
America's team has world now.

[02:44:36.930 --> 02:44:38.010]
Oh where find.

[02:44:38.830 --> 02:44:40.010]
What is Troy gay?

[02:44:40.710 --> 02:44:42.910]
I've heard some people say

[02:44:43.730 --> 02:44:49.050]
In the huddle he goes down A-ake man.

[02:44:50.510 --> 02:44:53.590]
He goes down on his knees, Eggman.

[02:44:55.570 --> 02:44:58.550]
I can't some balls to squeeze, Eggman.

[02:45:00.530 --> 02:45:06.490]
Don't clip him cause he likes it from behind.

[02:45:07.450 --> 02:45:08.790]
I hear the rumors all over town.

[02:45:09.010 --> 02:45:11.810]
Now that's the day once I was going to get canned for that phone call

[02:45:11.810 --> 02:45:13.070]
I had allegedly made it to Eggman.

[02:45:13.170 --> 02:45:14.130]
If that's true, Dave, you're out.

[02:45:14.210 --> 02:45:15.310]
We don't like your mustache anyway.

[02:45:16.430 --> 02:45:17.350]
1217-560.

[02:45:17.350 --> 02:45:19.490]
I got Carlis on the assignment and I looked at Melrose Place.

[02:45:19.670 --> 02:45:22.350]
I would have thought for sure somebody would have called Interfaxed

[02:45:22.870 --> 02:45:24.650]
in the name of the actor I'm looking for from Melrose Place.

[02:45:25.590 --> 02:45:30.030]
Once I tell you, I mean he was hotter than your Barbecue.

[02:45:31.530 --> 02:45:33.630]
Okay, I'm telling you, when that show was big,

[02:45:33.830 --> 02:45:35.350]
remember when that show was big, Melrose Place?

[02:45:35.750 --> 02:45:36.270]
About five minutes.

[02:45:36.690 --> 02:45:37.870]
Do you remember the name of the character?

[02:45:38.790 --> 02:45:39.950]
I didn't watch the show.

[02:45:40.950 --> 02:45:43.130]
So how is he supposed to find who you're thinking about?

[02:45:43.790 --> 02:45:47.130]
Because I have the names of the actors and actresses who played in the show.

[02:45:47.130 --> 02:45:48.250]
Okay, at the top of the name of the...

[02:45:48.250 --> 02:45:50.730]
Start from the list and give me the names and I'll tell you who I'm talking about.

[02:45:50.950 --> 02:45:51.010]
Who's the guy?

[02:45:52.470 --> 02:45:53.190]
Thomas Collabra.

[02:45:53.270 --> 02:45:53.410]
Ah!

[02:45:53.930 --> 02:45:54.570]
Jack Wanger.

[02:45:55.010 --> 02:45:55.370]
Ah!

[02:45:56.470 --> 02:45:56.830]
Almost.

[02:45:57.450 --> 02:45:58.290]
Oh, we're fine.

[02:45:58.870 --> 02:45:58.870]

[02:45:59.850 --> 02:46:00.390]
Rob Estes.

[02:46:00.630 --> 02:46:01.910]
Now we, uh, Rob Estes.

[02:46:02.070 --> 02:46:02.650]
Now not anymore.

[02:46:02.850 --> 02:46:03.250]
He don't go to Estes.

[02:46:03.250 --> 02:46:05.890]
But as I'm talking about Rob Estes from Silk Stockings.

[02:46:06.790 --> 02:46:09.550]
Well, I'll tell you, he sure was on the list like five minutes ago.

[02:46:09.670 --> 02:46:10.370]
Not anymore, too old.

[02:46:10.670 --> 02:46:11.710]
Olden, he's had it.

[02:46:11.990 --> 02:46:12.470]
Keep going.

[02:46:13.570 --> 02:46:13.930]
Who?

[02:46:14.210 --> 02:46:14.750]
Ron Popeel.

[02:46:14.930 --> 02:46:16.470]
John Haymes, something or other.

[02:46:16.470 --> 02:46:17.010]
No.

[02:46:17.850 --> 02:46:18.470]
Haymes Newton.

[02:46:18.950 --> 02:46:20.150]
No, Haymes, we Newton now.

[02:46:21.690 --> 02:46:22.410]
Next page.

[02:46:22.650 --> 02:46:23.610]
Oh, come on, Carlos.

[02:46:23.790 --> 02:46:24.050]
Quick, quick.

[02:46:24.050 --> 02:46:25.050]
Make it a big project.

[02:46:26.090 --> 02:46:27.930]
This is an important stuff.

[02:46:29.950 --> 02:46:30.790]
One moment, please.

[02:46:31.070 --> 02:46:31.230]
Yeah.

[02:46:31.390 --> 02:46:32.170]
Your call is important.

[02:46:32.350 --> 02:46:34.230]
Oh, you mean to say that your computer is that slow?

[02:46:34.350 --> 02:46:35.190]
That's not on the next page?

[02:46:35.310 --> 02:46:36.430]
All the operators are going to be the...

[02:46:36.430 --> 02:46:36.750]
You're the computer expert?

[02:46:37.250 --> 02:46:37.630]
Oh, that's right.

[02:46:37.750 --> 02:46:39.990]
Your call will be answered in the order of the...

[02:46:40.510 --> 02:46:40.870]
Oh.

[02:46:42.670 --> 02:46:44.370]
It's the moment that you say it.

[02:46:44.390 --> 02:46:45.770]
You'll know exactly who I'm talking about.

[02:46:46.230 --> 02:46:46.690]
Oh, yeah.

[02:46:46.950 --> 02:46:47.550]
You will.

[02:46:47.750 --> 02:46:48.010]
Okay.

[02:46:48.130 --> 02:46:48.850]
Even you'll know.

[02:46:49.690 --> 02:46:52.390]
Even a stuffy old head of roll like you will know who I'm talking about.

[02:46:52.670 --> 02:46:54.370]
If he ever gets to it, what are you doing in there?

[02:46:54.690 --> 02:46:55.010]
Clicking.

[02:46:55.130 --> 02:46:55.830]
He's clicking it.

[02:46:56.050 --> 02:46:56.330]
He's clicking it.

[02:46:57.210 --> 02:47:00.130]
They don't have a side anymore, so he's got to find other...

[02:47:00.130 --> 02:47:01.710]
Like, fansize some other people.

[02:47:01.710 --> 02:47:06.570]
560, 560, 560, 560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line.

[02:47:06.670 --> 02:47:07.910]
I find this to be so un-American.

[02:47:08.410 --> 02:47:09.710]
I think it's a communist plot.

[02:47:10.670 --> 02:47:11.690]
What's going on here today?

[02:47:12.670 --> 02:47:13.150]
Here's Miami.

[02:47:13.350 --> 02:47:13.510]
Hello.

[02:47:14.710 --> 02:47:15.570]
Anthony Sbato, Jr.

[02:47:15.810 --> 02:47:16.030]
No.

[02:47:16.470 --> 02:47:16.690]
Miami.

[02:47:16.850 --> 02:47:17.010]
Hello.

[02:47:18.010 --> 02:47:18.330]
Yes, sir.

[02:47:18.730 --> 02:47:18.950]
Neil.

[02:47:19.130 --> 02:47:19.770]
How are you?

[02:47:20.070 --> 02:47:20.230]
Great.

[02:47:20.970 --> 02:47:21.870]
Hey, two things.

[02:47:22.430 --> 02:47:23.690]
I've got somebody for your poll.

[02:47:23.850 --> 02:47:24.470]
I think it's really hot.

[02:47:24.610 --> 02:47:24.870]
Okay.

[02:47:25.210 --> 02:47:26.090]
Some folks down here.

[02:47:26.290 --> 02:47:26.890]
Sophia Vergara.

[02:47:27.550 --> 02:47:28.410]
Sophia Vergara?

[02:47:29.750 --> 02:47:31.510]
You're Georgia saying you're Georgia...

[02:47:31.510 --> 02:47:33.410]
Georgia's shaking it right now and it's head-to.

[02:47:33.870 --> 02:47:33.870]

[02:47:34.390 --> 02:47:35.250]
Oh, that's saying yes.

[02:47:35.450 --> 02:47:35.790]
He's nodding.

[02:47:35.810 --> 02:47:37.890]
I used to drive conceptivism.

[02:47:37.970 --> 02:47:38.730]
They did a great job.

[02:47:38.790 --> 02:47:39.170]
They're excellent.

[02:47:39.730 --> 02:47:40.470]
Yeah, they're very, very good.

[02:47:40.550 --> 02:47:41.050]
I was very pleased.

[02:47:41.590 --> 02:47:42.070]
Thanks, Neil.

[02:47:42.070 --> 02:47:43.350]
Have a great life.

[02:47:43.650 --> 02:47:43.970]
I'll mount it.

[02:47:44.210 --> 02:47:45.030]
Yeah, okay.

[02:47:45.130 --> 02:47:45.770]
What other names now?

[02:47:45.830 --> 02:47:46.310]
Come on, let's go.

[02:47:46.410 --> 02:47:48.250]
In fact, maybe I'll even remember it before you get with it,

[02:47:48.310 --> 02:47:52.430]
because you're so useless today, as opposed to like most other days.

[02:47:53.610 --> 02:47:54.190]
Still nothing.

[02:47:54.330 --> 02:47:55.790]
You still don't have any more names from the cast.

[02:47:55.790 --> 02:47:57.770]
That can't be all the names from the cast.

[02:47:59.230 --> 02:48:00.430]
From Melrose Place.

[02:48:04.590 --> 02:48:05.810]
I'm about to read a show.

[02:48:06.170 --> 02:48:06.290]
Who?

[02:48:07.190 --> 02:48:07.890]
Grant Show.

[02:48:08.110 --> 02:48:08.730]
No, hell no.

[02:48:09.130 --> 02:48:09.610]
Grant Show.

[02:48:10.550 --> 02:48:12.070]
I don't know who that is, but that ain't it.

[02:48:12.390 --> 02:48:12.790]
Keep going.

[02:48:14.070 --> 02:48:15.050]
Here's a call from Boca.

[02:48:15.110 --> 02:48:15.310]
Hello.

[02:48:16.230 --> 02:48:16.630]
Hello?

[02:48:16.870 --> 02:48:17.230]
Yes, sir.

[02:48:18.410 --> 02:48:18.850]
Hey, Brook.

[02:48:19.050 --> 02:48:21.590]
How about Brook Burke from the E. Entertainment Channel?

[02:48:21.930 --> 02:48:22.290]
Brook Burke?

[02:48:22.590 --> 02:48:23.210]
David Sharvey.

[02:48:23.850 --> 02:48:25.170]
No, not David Sharvey.

[02:48:25.170 --> 02:48:26.030]
Hey, Brook Burke.

[02:48:26.630 --> 02:48:26.930]
Yeah.

[02:48:27.270 --> 02:48:28.010]
What do you say, George?

[02:48:28.530 --> 02:48:29.170]
From the E.

[02:48:29.210 --> 02:48:29.330]
Yes.

[02:48:29.330 --> 02:48:29.810]
Oh, he says yes.

[02:48:30.610 --> 02:48:31.250]
That's good.

[02:48:31.390 --> 02:48:32.010]
George said C.

[02:48:32.690 --> 02:48:33.670]
Are you a Jew?

[02:48:33.810 --> 02:48:34.270]
I'd like to see.

[02:48:35.330 --> 02:48:36.290]
5667-0560.

[02:48:36.730 --> 02:48:38.170]
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

[02:48:39.330 --> 02:48:41.930]
5661-18T and Verizon Wireless Line.

[02:48:42.430 --> 02:48:43.170]
Oh, God.

[02:48:43.170 --> 02:48:43.330]
Good.

[02:48:43.490 --> 02:48:43.970]
And Ashby.

[02:48:44.250 --> 02:48:44.390]
Who?

[02:48:44.750 --> 02:48:46.130]
Lyndon Ashby.

[02:48:46.450 --> 02:48:46.970]
David Sharvey.

[02:48:47.170 --> 02:48:48.010]
You got to be kidding me.

[02:48:48.330 --> 02:48:50.270]
What did Sharvey autograph to pick your personal for me?

[02:48:50.410 --> 02:48:50.950]
I was basically there.

[02:48:51.090 --> 02:48:51.430]
I was basically there.

[02:48:51.610 --> 02:48:52.570]
He was on Baywatch.

[02:48:52.870 --> 02:48:53.370]
David Sharvey.

[02:48:53.370 --> 02:48:54.070]
Keep going.

[02:48:54.870 --> 02:48:55.570]
That's it?

[02:48:56.190 --> 02:48:56.630]
No.

[02:48:56.870 --> 02:48:57.670]
You know something?

[02:48:57.890 --> 02:48:58.590]
You're a...

[02:48:58.590 --> 02:48:59.650]
This is a plot I did.

[02:48:59.770 --> 02:49:00.470]
He gave you a light.

[02:49:00.770 --> 02:49:01.430]
I saw gasoline.

[02:49:01.850 --> 02:49:03.130]
No, maybe your brain is not me.

[02:49:03.350 --> 02:49:03.350]

[02:49:03.350 --> 02:49:03.970]
It is not me.

[02:49:04.350 --> 02:49:05.370]
He was like one of the major...

[02:49:05.970 --> 02:49:07.450]
When Ashby was at his, how did it speak?

[02:49:07.950 --> 02:49:08.910]
Even more than twing geek.

[02:49:09.370 --> 02:49:11.650]
He was like a big, huge, gigantic.

[02:49:11.950 --> 02:49:13.530]
I would say like about this, this long.

[02:49:15.210 --> 02:49:17.010]
5667 and this audience doesn't know?

[02:49:18.130 --> 02:49:18.890]
Andrew Shoe.

[02:49:19.390 --> 02:49:19.650]
Ah!

[02:49:20.750 --> 02:49:21.310]
That's it.

[02:49:22.150 --> 02:49:22.790]
Andrew Shoe.

[02:49:22.790 --> 02:49:23.890]
Now where did you find that?

[02:49:25.230 --> 02:49:25.550]
Caller.

[02:49:25.930 --> 02:49:26.590]
From a caller.

[02:49:26.750 --> 02:49:27.530]
Thank you so much.

[02:49:27.810 --> 02:49:28.890]
You don't know who Andrew Shoe is?

[02:49:29.010 --> 02:49:29.010]

[02:49:29.530 --> 02:49:31.790]
I think it's time to drop the other shoe if you asked me.

[02:49:32.970 --> 02:49:34.730]
We got him on Earth's S-H-U-E, right?

[02:49:36.010 --> 02:49:36.650]
Andrew Shoe.

[02:49:36.910 --> 02:49:37.910]
You know him if you've seen him.

[02:49:38.290 --> 02:49:40.590]
You say, oh yeah, he used to be pretty big on it, Shoe.

[02:49:40.890 --> 02:49:41.490]
Okay, Andrew Shoe.

[02:49:41.590 --> 02:49:43.850]
We got to put a couple of guys on here for the ladies out there

[02:49:43.850 --> 02:49:46.170]
and those other ladies who would like to dress up on a weekend.

[02:49:48.370 --> 02:49:51.110]

And Verizon wireless line.

[02:49:55.650 --> 02:49:56.710]
Here's a call from Miami.

[02:49:56.710 --> 02:49:57.050]
Hello.

[02:49:57.390 --> 02:49:58.330]
Oh, hello, Neil.

[02:49:58.530 --> 02:49:58.890]
Yes, sir.

[02:49:59.090 --> 02:50:00.390]
I have a name for this.

[02:50:00.670 --> 02:50:04.010]
How about Jerry Ryan from Boston Public?

[02:50:04.810 --> 02:50:05.150]
Jerry.

[02:50:05.790 --> 02:50:06.030]
Ryan.

[02:50:06.490 --> 02:50:07.790]
Towards your give me four thumbs up.

[02:50:07.810 --> 02:50:08.150]
Jerry Ryan.

[02:50:08.310 --> 02:50:09.650]
She's the cyborg we have up on the wall.

[02:50:09.730 --> 02:50:10.130]
Oh, yeah.

[02:50:10.250 --> 02:50:10.550]
Okay.

[02:50:11.230 --> 02:50:11.910]
Good choice.

[02:50:12.190 --> 02:50:12.530]
All right.

[02:50:12.590 --> 02:50:13.190]
Thank you.

[02:50:13.290 --> 02:50:14.430]
How are you be spelling that?

[02:50:14.670 --> 02:50:14.870]
Jerry.

[02:50:15.270 --> 02:50:16.050]

[02:50:16.550 --> 02:50:17.290]
Jerry with an I.

[02:50:17.390 --> 02:50:18.010]
Yeah, I'm with a J.

[02:50:18.010 --> 02:50:19.130]
R-Y-A-N.

[02:50:19.250 --> 02:50:19.870]
Oh, Ryan.

[02:50:20.310 --> 02:50:20.470]
Ryan.

[02:50:20.470 --> 02:50:21.350]
Oh, that sounds pretty simple.

[02:50:21.590 --> 02:50:23.090]
Like in saving a private Ryan.

[02:50:23.790 --> 02:50:23.930]
Right.

[02:50:24.270 --> 02:50:24.930]
Is it Meg Ryan?

[02:50:25.070 --> 02:50:25.630]
Life of Ryan.

[02:50:26.050 --> 02:50:26.250]
Right.

[02:50:27.150 --> 02:50:27.790]
Ryan Foster.

[02:50:29.790 --> 02:50:30.430]

[02:50:30.770 --> 02:50:31.350]
Singing in the Ryan.

[02:50:33.050 --> 02:50:33.690]
5667-0560.

[02:50:33.950 --> 02:50:34.290]
Guy Mitchell.

[02:50:34.490 --> 02:50:35.030]
Singing in the Ryan.

[02:50:35.150 --> 02:50:35.530]
I remember that.

[02:50:35.610 --> 02:50:37.470]
Is Volka Bryant going to bring the stuff that we need here tomorrow

[02:50:37.470 --> 02:50:38.510]
the library's time?

[02:50:38.530 --> 02:50:38.850]
Sure.

[02:50:39.030 --> 02:50:39.830]
Because he better.

[02:50:39.910 --> 02:50:40.690]
That's all I want to say to him.

[02:50:40.730 --> 02:50:41.250]
He just better.

[02:50:41.410 --> 02:50:42.770]
I'm not going to make any threats.

[02:50:44.070 --> 02:50:45.090]
Although, you know, we do have to be...

[02:50:45.090 --> 02:50:45.530]
It's shocking.

[02:50:45.530 --> 02:50:46.970]
We have a lot that is not here.

[02:50:47.130 --> 02:50:47.490]
There are a lot of things that are empty on there.

[02:50:47.710 --> 02:50:49.330]
There are a lot that is not here.

[02:50:49.330 --> 02:50:51.250]
Yeah, you're too fresh for this show as well.

[02:50:51.310 --> 02:50:51.910]
I'm hearing it.

[02:50:51.930 --> 02:50:52.650]
That's what most said.

[02:50:53.390 --> 02:50:54.990]
He said, what a freshie thing you are, man.

[02:50:56.770 --> 02:50:57.570]
5667-0560.

[02:50:57.570 --> 02:50:58.570]

[02:51:00.790 --> 02:51:02.310]

[02:51:02.450 --> 02:51:04.750]
intemperally grotesque pictures that Star put in there.

[02:51:05.370 --> 02:51:05.970]
And Josie Lambert,

[02:51:06.030 --> 02:51:07.330]

I just want to say that all day of it.

[02:51:51.170 --> 02:51:51.610]
Lucy Liu.

[02:51:51.730 --> 02:51:52.130]
Lucy Liu.

[02:51:52.350 --> 02:51:53.490]
Isn't there something about Santa?

[02:51:54.170 --> 02:51:54.710]

Christine Aguilara's got 5.

[02:52:02.350 --> 02:52:03.810]
I'm not going to do that again because if I do that,

[02:52:03.930 --> 02:52:04.750]
I'll get all screwed up again.

[02:52:05.410 --> 02:52:07.290]
Jessica Simpson 4, Faith Hills God 4.

[02:52:07.410 --> 02:52:08.190]

Heath Law Ledger's got 1.

[02:52:23.610 --> 02:52:24.770]
I don't know who that is, Heath Ledger.

[02:52:25.470 --> 02:52:26.770]
Hayden Christiansen don't have 1.

[02:52:27.930 --> 02:52:29.470]
Maybe for the movie they're like...

[02:52:29.470 --> 02:52:29.890]
They play...

[02:52:29.890 --> 02:52:33.310]
They play like Mel movies, but the Patriot was it bad and he's at it.

[02:52:33.590 --> 02:52:34.810]
Fox News Heather don't have any.

[02:52:34.930 --> 02:52:36.590]
And he's at his Monica Balutsi.

[02:52:36.590 --> 02:52:39.850]
Now with two Z's...

[02:52:39.850 --> 02:52:41.830]
With two Z's...

[02:52:42.830 --> 02:52:43.590]
Oh my God.

[02:52:44.670 --> 02:52:45.770]
And now with the guy said...

[02:52:45.770 --> 02:52:46.850]
See, her name is Balutsi.

[02:52:46.990 --> 02:52:47.590]
With two Z's.

[02:52:47.630 --> 02:52:48.450]
Now with two Z's.

[02:52:48.630 --> 02:52:49.710]
You know how your Italian Mr.

[02:52:49.870 --> 02:52:50.550]
did Eric do that.

[02:52:51.150 --> 02:52:52.050]
Who made the mistake?

[02:52:53.210 --> 02:52:53.490]
Carlos.

[02:52:53.670 --> 02:52:55.250]
Carlos made the mistake and Roman is Italian.

[02:52:56.330 --> 02:52:57.170]
Cut the crap, Spic.

[02:52:58.010 --> 02:52:59.570]
Fox News Heather don't have any.

[02:52:59.650 --> 02:53:00.110]
That's amazing.

[02:53:00.590 --> 02:53:02.390]
Noah Campbell's got done some a high act.

[02:53:02.550 --> 02:53:03.130]
Jenna Jamison.

[02:53:03.750 --> 02:53:04.530]
Jamie Presley.

[02:53:05.370 --> 02:53:06.170]

Heather Graham.

[02:53:07.470 --> 02:53:08.210]
Leah Remini.

[02:53:08.290 --> 02:53:08.850]
They have none.

[02:53:09.570 --> 02:53:10.510]
So better get with it.

[02:53:10.790 --> 02:53:11.510]
582 votes.

[02:53:11.670 --> 02:53:13.870]
The votes are pouring in and some of them are actually for real.

[02:53:14.230 --> 02:53:16.030]
Just like you were pulled yesterday about...

[02:53:16.030 --> 02:53:16.930]
Man, that's cool about George.

[02:53:17.010 --> 02:53:18.950]
If you missed that, you missed a shocker.

[02:53:19.510 --> 02:53:22.370]
We had 75 million 462 thousand votes.

[02:53:23.810 --> 02:53:24.770]
A mixed bag.

[02:53:24.990 --> 02:53:25.470]
They hate him.

[02:53:25.570 --> 02:53:26.030]
They love him.

[02:53:26.090 --> 02:53:26.590]
He's boring.

[02:53:26.670 --> 02:53:27.370]
He's obnoxious.

[02:53:27.590 --> 02:53:28.550]
He's an anti-Semite.

[02:53:28.790 --> 02:53:29.610]
He's a little Spic.

[02:53:29.830 --> 02:53:31.110]
He's a...mumbler.

[02:53:31.770 --> 02:53:33.190]
And that came in last, by the way.

[02:53:33.190 --> 02:53:34.070]
And that would have been the correct vote.

[02:53:34.190 --> 02:53:34.650]
That was my vote.

[02:53:34.650 --> 02:53:35.730]
He's the only you think that.

[02:53:36.130 --> 02:53:36.710]
No, I don't.

[02:53:36.810 --> 02:53:37.170]
You...

[02:53:37.170 --> 02:53:39.110]
I'm the only one ever said you're a mummer.

[02:53:39.270 --> 02:53:40.930]
You're the only one that's ever said that I'm a mumble.

[02:53:41.670 --> 02:53:43.570]
Plus the other 25 people have voted that.

[02:53:44.270 --> 02:53:44.430]
Right.

[02:53:45.110 --> 02:53:49.050]
When you multiply that times a thousand, that's 25,000.

[02:53:49.050 --> 02:53:50.590]
And it doesn't multiply that number by a million.

[02:53:50.810 --> 02:53:51.010]
Right.

[02:53:51.350 --> 02:53:52.650]
And you got 25,000 million.

[02:53:53.690 --> 02:53:55.030]
Which is how much money we're going to...

[02:53:55.030 --> 02:53:57.030]
That's the budget deficit right now.

[02:53:57.070 --> 02:53:58.350]
That's what the president is going to tell you tonight.

[02:53:58.830 --> 02:53:59.750]
Things aren't looking too good.

[02:54:00.030 --> 02:54:01.310]
How's the market doing, by the way?

[02:54:01.570 --> 02:54:02.930]
Oh, there's what's his name, Joe Biden.

[02:54:02.930 --> 02:54:05.550]
And the response would be the same response that occurs,

[02:54:05.770 --> 02:54:09.150]
seeing Israelis knocking down a building,

[02:54:09.790 --> 02:54:12.330]
or seeing a child killed in a crossfire.

[02:54:12.990 --> 02:54:14.750]
Are they killing kids on crossfire?

[02:54:14.810 --> 02:54:16.610]
Or they are desperate for ratings on CNN, aren't they?

[02:54:18.050 --> 02:54:19.930]
26 past 0.5, 60 WQA.

[02:54:20.690 --> 02:54:21.410]
Am I one who's doing it?

[02:54:21.450 --> 02:54:22.990]
I think it's the one with the boat tie.

[02:54:23.050 --> 02:54:23.430]
What's his name?

[02:54:23.590 --> 02:54:24.950]
Tyler Taylor.

[02:54:25.590 --> 02:54:26.470]
Tyler, what's his name?

[02:54:26.490 --> 02:54:27.150]
It's on the food channel.

[02:54:27.450 --> 02:54:28.770]

[02:57:29.110 --> 02:57:31.450]
You can't carry the way Mo is squintin' on me.

[02:57:31.770 --> 02:57:32.110]

[02:58:05.650 --> 02:58:07.770]
Like an old cock-ass-shoot.

[02:58:09.710 --> 02:58:11.270]
It even tails legs.

[02:58:11.270 --> 02:58:15.350]
Like when I melt the hot wax in my eyes.

[02:58:17.190 --> 02:58:18.670]
This old one here sings.

[02:58:20.110 --> 02:58:22.190]
So I gotta get a brand new bag.

[02:58:24.630 --> 02:58:27.630]

[02:58:39.770 --> 02:58:40.870]
Any famous Roderard World?

[02:58:42.150 --> 02:58:43.670]
I heard he made a $20 bet.

[02:58:43.770 --> 02:58:45.850]
He lost his somebody and everybody all across the globe.

[02:58:45.910 --> 02:58:47.830]
I heard the president is going to reference it

[02:58:47.830 --> 02:58:49.050]

[02:58:51.710 --> 02:58:52.890]

[02:58:53.930 --> 02:58:54.530]
560 W.C.M.

[02:58:54.550 --> 02:58:56.170]
On the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Lines.

[02:58:56.470 --> 02:58:59.530]
Roma Downey, who is Monica from Duce By an Angel.

[02:59:00.030 --> 02:59:01.650]
And you say...

[02:59:01.650 --> 02:59:02.270]

[02:59:03.210 --> 02:59:04.130]
You know who that is?

[02:59:04.430 --> 02:59:06.110]
Yes, you watch Duce By an Angel.

[02:59:06.470 --> 02:59:08.270]
He's black, he's old black, and fat.

[02:59:08.270 --> 02:59:09.450]
But other than the choke fat.

[02:59:09.570 --> 02:59:10.770]
And for the ladies, Mike Piazza.

[02:59:12.690 --> 02:59:13.010]
No.

[02:59:13.550 --> 02:59:15.010]
I don't think he's got something for the ladies.

[02:59:15.230 --> 02:59:15.570]
But anyway.

[02:59:16.810 --> 02:59:17.450]
Head to their grant.

[02:59:17.590 --> 02:59:18.330]
We already got his grant.

[02:59:18.450 --> 02:59:18.870]
Thank you very much.

[02:59:18.950 --> 02:59:19.550]
How about Bob Graham?

[02:59:21.290 --> 02:59:22.950]
How did he have that surgery or not?

[02:59:24.510 --> 02:59:25.070]
I thought he did.

[02:59:25.130 --> 02:59:26.170]
He always teases with us.

[02:59:26.270 --> 02:59:27.330]
He was going in for surgery.

[02:59:27.330 --> 02:59:27.830]
He had surgery.

[02:59:28.030 --> 02:59:29.650]
They were going to put the pieces back together again.

[02:59:29.750 --> 02:59:30.290]
Like Humpty Dumpty.

[02:59:30.630 --> 02:59:31.630]
And then he's going to decide March.

[02:59:31.630 --> 02:59:32.390]
If he's going to run or not.

[02:59:32.530 --> 02:59:34.210]
But I never heard another word about that.

[02:59:35.390 --> 02:59:36.950]
We heard about most Colostomy bag.

[02:59:36.950 --> 02:59:38.950]
But other than that, we never heard about...

[02:59:39.590 --> 02:59:40.630]
B.D.I.Babby.

[02:59:40.910 --> 02:59:42.090]
Rachel Weiss, the mummy.

[02:59:45.150 --> 02:59:46.450]
Okay, here's the...

[02:59:46.450 --> 02:59:46.910]
Okay.

[02:59:47.010 --> 02:59:47.290]
He votes.

[02:59:47.650 --> 02:59:48.950]
Now, how do you spell that next last name?

[02:59:49.030 --> 02:59:50.690]
Because they got W-E-I-C-Z.

[02:59:51.830 --> 02:59:52.590]
Rachel, you're right.

[02:59:53.170 --> 02:59:53.430]
You think?

[02:59:54.590 --> 02:59:56.270]
Well, I just want to make sure you get spelling.

[02:59:56.470 --> 02:59:57.190]
That's fairly close.

[02:59:57.450 --> 02:59:57.610]
Okay.

[02:59:57.910 --> 02:59:58.730]
Do the spell check.

[02:59:59.070 --> 03:00:00.650]
I know they don't have spell check on names.

[03:00:00.870 --> 03:00:01.270]
Fucked you.

[03:00:01.710 --> 03:00:02.450]

[03:00:06.510 --> 03:00:07.270]

There you go.

[03:00:12.210 --> 03:00:13.490]
Is she as cute as...

[03:00:13.490 --> 03:00:14.190]

[03:00:14.890 --> 03:00:15.410]

[03:00:15.810 --> 03:00:16.050]

[03:00:16.770 --> 03:00:17.570]
Oh, yeah.

[03:00:17.910 --> 03:00:19.450]
Natalie Portman, who's even cuter than...

[03:00:19.990 --> 03:00:20.810]
Little Hayden Christensen.

[03:00:21.110 --> 03:00:22.070]
What was that movie I saw him in?

[03:00:22.150 --> 03:00:24.570]
Where he liked all of a sudden blossoming in like a real human being?

[03:00:24.890 --> 03:00:25.310]
I don't know what it was.

[03:00:26.170 --> 03:00:26.690]
Jessica Alba.

[03:00:27.890 --> 03:00:29.270]
She makes that diet drink.

[03:00:29.450 --> 03:00:31.470]
The Alba 66 that you get the same old cancel.

[03:00:31.470 --> 03:00:31.950]
She's hot.

[03:00:32.470 --> 03:00:33.310]
Jessica Alba.

[03:00:33.370 --> 03:00:34.750]
Look at all the hot chicks out there.

[03:00:34.750 --> 03:00:35.590]
And you guys can't get laid.

[03:00:35.710 --> 03:00:36.450]
What's wrong with you?

[03:00:36.570 --> 03:00:37.610]
Who can't?

[03:00:37.610 --> 03:00:39.190]
Oh, no comment.

[03:00:39.770 --> 03:00:40.850]
Buffy provided an ambulance.

[03:00:41.170 --> 03:00:41.350]
Buffy?

[03:00:41.870 --> 03:00:43.250]
From Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

[03:00:43.530 --> 03:00:43.950]
Sermishelgiller.

[03:00:44.530 --> 03:00:44.950]
And?

[03:00:45.590 --> 03:00:47.130]
Oh, she's not related to that kid.

[03:00:47.350 --> 03:00:47.710]
What's his name?

[03:00:47.830 --> 03:00:49.170]
That Michael Guslargiller.

[03:00:49.510 --> 03:00:50.190]
Whatever his name is.

[03:00:50.870 --> 03:00:51.510]
I hope not.

[03:00:51.750 --> 03:00:54.690]
She's cute, but not like these other people in the list.

[03:00:55.290 --> 03:00:58.470]
Look, the problem with you is you're not given me like the definitive...

[03:00:58.470 --> 03:01:01.950]
We can't make a list of every female in a face of the earth and a handful of males

[03:01:01.950 --> 03:01:05.290]
threw in in there gratuitously just to please some of us old fags in a couple of ladies.

[03:01:05.990 --> 03:01:06.290]
Right.

[03:01:06.770 --> 03:01:07.390]
Serena Williams.

[03:01:07.650 --> 03:01:08.490]
There's no chance.

[03:01:08.750 --> 03:01:09.410]
There is no chance.

[03:01:09.590 --> 03:01:12.530]
She's about as hot as the top of your stove when it's on like high cook.

[03:01:12.910 --> 03:01:13.170]
Okay?

[03:01:13.470 --> 03:01:16.190]
She's about as hot as putting your head in the ice box.

[03:01:16.910 --> 03:01:18.190]
Did I say the top of your stove?

[03:01:19.250 --> 03:01:21.390]
I don't know what I'm talking about because Muff was just here.

[03:01:21.430 --> 03:01:22.270]
Remember, like that.

[03:01:22.470 --> 03:01:22.590]
You know?

[03:01:23.150 --> 03:01:24.510]
He's just all wild.

[03:01:24.670 --> 03:01:25.450]
He's just a wild man.

[03:01:26.330 --> 03:01:27.430]
Which is the way we like him.

[03:01:27.430 --> 03:01:28.590]
He's always good when he's a wild man.

[03:01:28.790 --> 03:01:29.650]
Talking all kinds of crap.

[03:01:29.810 --> 03:01:30.870]
I wasn't paying any attention to anything.

[03:01:31.030 --> 03:01:36.710]
He said, 56670560.560 on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line.

[03:01:36.770 --> 03:01:37.630]
The list is expanding.

[03:01:37.810 --> 03:01:38.150]
It's growing.

[03:01:38.190 --> 03:01:39.050]
It's getting gigantic.

[03:01:39.610 --> 03:01:42.450]
And the race at the top, even though I have a feeling it's very very contrived today.

[03:01:42.490 --> 03:01:43.050]
But that's okay.

[03:01:43.470 --> 03:01:44.090]
Makes it exciting.

[03:01:44.570 --> 03:01:45.210]
608 votes.

[03:01:45.730 --> 03:01:47.030]
Still many that have zero.

[03:01:47.570 --> 03:01:49.550]
Britney's got 69, howdy berry 67.

[03:01:50.030 --> 03:01:51.290]
She's giving her a run for her money.

[03:01:51.990 --> 03:01:52.490]
You know what?

[03:01:52.670 --> 03:01:53.150]
Do you believe it?

[03:01:54.590 --> 03:01:55.770]
Now, if you had a choose.

[03:01:56.550 --> 03:01:58.690]
Not that Carlos is not like, yeah.

[03:01:59.070 --> 03:02:00.450]
Like you're going to choose, right?

[03:02:01.970 --> 03:02:04.770]
If you had a choose between Britney Spears and Halle Berry,

[03:02:05.010 --> 03:02:07.090]
and Nick it is a jabourd, hop it right into your sack.

[03:02:07.570 --> 03:02:09.570]
And the bed, and the bed that is, not your sack.

[03:02:11.030 --> 03:02:11.650]
Which one?

[03:02:14.230 --> 03:02:15.310]
What are you laughing about?

[03:02:15.790 --> 03:02:16.810]
Carlos says the young and.

[03:02:19.290 --> 03:02:20.250]
The young and the ugly?

[03:02:20.770 --> 03:02:21.570]
I see that show.

[03:02:24.010 --> 03:02:26.550]
Britney Spears 69, howdy berry 67.

[03:02:26.930 --> 03:02:28.050]
Anna Cornelhoi, her 60.

[03:02:28.490 --> 03:02:29.850]
The world's greatest fag hag.

[03:02:30.510 --> 03:02:31.890]
Elizabeth Hurley 53.

[03:02:32.230 --> 03:02:34.310]
Jackie Johnson, channel 7, weather 41.

[03:02:34.710 --> 03:02:35.990]
Carmen, electro 38.

[03:02:36.570 --> 03:02:38.330]
Penelope's cruise 32 and spotted.

[03:02:38.490 --> 03:02:40.890]
Georgia's grotesque and unexcatable comments.

[03:02:41.150 --> 03:02:41.290]
Craigs are crazy.

[03:02:41.450 --> 03:02:42.150]
No, it's not yet.

[03:02:42.370 --> 03:02:43.030]
Chennai 20.

[03:02:43.930 --> 03:02:44.970]
Catherine Zeta Jones, right?

[03:02:45.130 --> 03:02:47.230]
So in other words, anything you don't agree with is a crank vote.

[03:02:47.510 --> 03:02:48.150]
No, just that.

[03:02:48.430 --> 03:02:49.910]
Catherine Zeta Jones 26.

[03:02:51.870 --> 03:02:54.010]
Jennifer Garner 18.

[03:02:54.310 --> 03:02:55.150]
Sharon Stone 16.

[03:02:55.410 --> 03:02:56.230]
Jalos got 16.

[03:02:56.550 --> 03:02:57.490]
That's a silly s vote.

[03:02:57.790 --> 03:02:58.810]
Oliver Reckens voted for her.

[03:02:59.270 --> 03:03:00.490]
And Brad Pitt, he's got 15.

[03:03:01.030 --> 03:03:02.090]
Jennifer Connelly 14.

[03:03:02.450 --> 03:03:03.370]
And then it goes down from there.

[03:03:03.830 --> 03:03:04.570]
How's Tom Brady doing?

[03:03:04.670 --> 03:03:05.130]
Only 8.

[03:03:06.370 --> 03:03:08.410]
Kristen Crucks got 6 and Tom Williams got 5.

[03:03:08.630 --> 03:03:09.430]
I'm going to tell you right now.

[03:03:09.510 --> 03:03:11.810]
Anybody who thinks that Kristen Crucks is prettier than Tom Walling

[03:03:11.810 --> 03:03:13.730]
really needs an eye adjustment right now.

[03:03:14.230 --> 03:03:15.370]
She's prettier than Tom Walling.

[03:03:15.430 --> 03:03:15.990]
No, she is not.

[03:03:17.330 --> 03:03:20.010]
He is far more in there isn't even a contest.

[03:03:20.350 --> 03:03:22.490]
Now we'll see this when he starts taking his clothes off.

[03:03:22.610 --> 03:03:24.910]
You put the Superman outfit back on Clark, okay?

[03:03:26.290 --> 03:03:30.190]
Extraordinarily disappointing for a strapping 6 foot 4-year-old man

[03:03:30.190 --> 03:03:31.370]
with size 14 shoes.

[03:03:31.630 --> 03:03:34.370]
He's got like two little tiny raisins where his nipples ought to be.

[03:03:34.730 --> 03:03:36.470]
He's got like, remember the show where he was like in it?

[03:03:36.610 --> 03:03:38.050]
And it's always cold on the set.

[03:03:38.430 --> 03:03:39.150]
No, you don't understand.

[03:03:39.450 --> 03:03:40.050]
There's nothing there.

[03:03:40.570 --> 03:03:41.450]
There is nothing there.

[03:03:41.570 --> 03:03:42.070]
He's got a scratch.

[03:03:42.270 --> 03:03:43.210]
He looks like a Dutchman.

[03:03:43.250 --> 03:03:45.650]
He's got that scrawny, emaciated kind of like post-Auschwitz body.

[03:03:45.650 --> 03:03:46.330]
Not good.

[03:03:46.990 --> 03:03:47.650]
Not good.

[03:03:48.390 --> 03:03:49.990]
So we're talking about chin-ups.

[03:03:50.370 --> 03:03:50.890]
From the chin-up.

[03:03:51.250 --> 03:03:54.030]
Now she got, we noticed, whether she's got like any breast or not?

[03:03:54.530 --> 03:03:56.370]
I haven't noticed any of significance.

[03:03:56.610 --> 03:03:57.570]
No, see that's my point.

[03:03:58.010 --> 03:03:59.130]
So maybe that's the thing on the show.

[03:03:59.250 --> 03:04:01.650]
And I'm saying that to blonde, whatever hell her name is,

[03:04:01.770 --> 03:04:02.630]
the one with the computer geek,

[03:04:03.390 --> 03:04:05.750]
she's the one I think is much more attractive than Nellana.

[03:04:06.270 --> 03:04:07.070]
So for the tender.

[03:04:07.430 --> 03:04:09.990]
But the role that she plays when you play a geeky role,

[03:04:10.130 --> 03:04:12.450]
people don't look upon you as being like, ah-ha!

[03:04:12.630 --> 03:04:12.850]
You know?

[03:04:13.010 --> 03:04:13.130]
Yeah.

[03:04:13.350 --> 03:04:13.550]
You're right.

[03:04:14.310 --> 03:04:15.230]
Right? Right.

[03:04:15.230 --> 03:04:18.250]
But she's not as hot as like Miguel on passions.

[03:04:18.450 --> 03:04:18.810]
Who?

[03:04:19.270 --> 03:04:20.030]
Miguel on passions.

[03:04:20.910 --> 03:04:21.670]
What's his real name?

[03:04:21.810 --> 03:04:22.610]
What's the actor that plays him?

[03:04:22.990 --> 03:04:24.650]
Jesse Ventura.

[03:04:25.610 --> 03:04:25.970]
Montaguto.

[03:04:26.130 --> 03:04:27.770]
Oh, Jesse, what's his name?

[03:04:28.050 --> 03:04:29.050]
He's not even Hispanic.

[03:04:30.730 --> 03:04:31.350]
What's his name like?

[03:04:31.430 --> 03:04:31.670]
Jesse?

[03:04:32.070 --> 03:04:32.870]
I wouldn't think so.

[03:04:34.430 --> 03:04:35.550]
It'll come to me momentarily.

[03:04:35.950 --> 03:04:36.870]
Can't believe I forgot that.

[03:04:36.970 --> 03:04:38.190]
That's my Alzheimer's kicking in.

[03:04:39.650 --> 03:04:41.310]
Now who's going to carry me in and out of bed

[03:04:41.310 --> 03:04:42.650]
when I get to be like David Brinkeley?

[03:04:42.750 --> 03:04:44.030]
Who's going to like pick me up in their arms

[03:04:44.030 --> 03:04:46.350]
and take me to the turlant and things like that?

[03:04:47.690 --> 03:04:49.890]
56670560, pound 560 on the 18.

[03:04:50.210 --> 03:04:52.570]
Yeah, Carlos, I don't want him picking me up under any circumstances.

[03:04:52.830 --> 03:04:54.390]
Even if I don't know who it is, I'll still know.

[03:04:54.790 --> 03:04:56.610]
There'll be a part of me saying, oh no, it's ugly Carlos.

[03:04:56.810 --> 03:04:57.470]
I'll be chucked.

[03:04:57.790 --> 03:04:58.390]
Don't touch me.

[03:04:58.590 --> 03:05:02.150]
We'll hire some decent looking people to pick you up.

[03:05:02.710 --> 03:05:04.530]
Like Moses, he's a bodybuilder now.

[03:05:04.590 --> 03:05:05.010]
He can do it.

[03:05:05.130 --> 03:05:06.030]
Remember in Clockwork Orange?

[03:05:06.630 --> 03:05:10.950]
How the old guy had his roommate, the big, burly muscular guy,

[03:05:10.950 --> 03:05:12.710]
who was actually the guy in the Darth Vader suit, by the way.

[03:05:12.710 --> 03:05:13.230]
Oh, yes, I did.

[03:05:13.370 --> 03:05:14.130]
Shlip him a rail, huh?

[03:05:14.430 --> 03:05:15.370]
Like a little rag doll.

[03:05:15.510 --> 03:05:15.570]
Right.

[03:05:15.830 --> 03:05:18.910]
We'll hire some big, good, singing in the rain.

[03:05:19.370 --> 03:05:19.370]

[03:05:19.370 --> 03:05:20.490]
I'm singing in the rain.

[03:05:20.630 --> 03:05:21.430]
What a great movie, man.

[03:05:21.610 --> 03:05:22.150]
Clockwork Orange.

[03:05:22.290 --> 03:05:22.630]
Yes, it was.

[03:05:22.790 --> 03:05:26.370]
And they put an X rating on it just because we saw Malcolm McDowell's penis

[03:05:26.370 --> 03:05:28.750]
or whatever wasn't a hit some vulgar language and violence.

[03:05:30.230 --> 03:05:32.850]
That was one of the all-time great movies at Clockwork Orange.

[03:05:33.010 --> 03:05:33.250]
Absolutely.

[03:05:35.070 --> 03:05:36.150]
Most people don't get it.

[03:05:36.350 --> 03:05:36.690]
Right, Dim?

[03:05:38.170 --> 03:05:40.730]
21-1-560WQM.

[03:05:40.730 --> 03:05:43.310]
In fact, when Muff went out here, I said, how's it going, Dim?

[03:05:43.870 --> 03:05:44.710]
He didn't say that.

[03:05:46.950 --> 03:05:48.050]
What are you smirking about?

[03:05:48.170 --> 03:05:48.810]
You're such a smirking.

[03:05:48.850 --> 03:05:51.650]
If the audience could see the smirks on your face during the show,

[03:05:51.730 --> 03:05:54.150]
they'd realize really what a hard-ass little spick you actually are.

[03:05:54.230 --> 03:05:55.410]
The vote, yes, they would have been a lot different.

[03:05:56.550 --> 03:05:57.710]
It would have been much different.

[03:05:58.350 --> 03:06:01.790]
Jesse, uh, and almost came to be there, Miguel, I'm glad.

[03:06:01.890 --> 03:06:02.690]
That's important to stuff.

[03:06:03.010 --> 03:06:04.610]
By the way, you got to see today's episode.

[03:06:05.070 --> 03:06:07.130]
Should I tell them what I've been at sport?

[03:06:07.430 --> 03:06:08.510]
No, I was at sport yesterday.

[03:06:08.750 --> 03:06:09.710]
Some, you know, bodybuilder.

[03:06:09.710 --> 03:06:14.170]
Should I tell them about what Sheridan decided what she's going to do about the antifonial?

[03:06:14.230 --> 03:06:14.230]

[03:06:14.930 --> 03:06:17.170]
Whether she's going to let me get the experimental drug?

[03:06:17.910 --> 03:06:19.810]
Quit turning my mic off, you jackass.

[03:06:21.510 --> 03:06:22.210]
Should I tell them?

[03:06:22.310 --> 03:06:22.670]
Because I know.

[03:06:22.910 --> 03:06:23.350]
Well, never mind.

[03:06:23.590 --> 03:06:25.150]
Well, even today, you will find out though.

[03:06:25.190 --> 03:06:25.650]
That's a good news.

[03:06:25.770 --> 03:06:27.510]
They've milked it for weeks and weeks and weeks.

[03:06:27.750 --> 03:06:29.330]
You got to make up your mind already, Sheridan.

[03:06:29.610 --> 03:06:30.930]
They named a street in Hollywood after you.

[03:06:30.970 --> 03:06:31.810]
Make up your mind, bitch.

[03:06:32.630 --> 03:06:34.050]
Now, I'll tell you, she's beautiful.

[03:06:34.610 --> 03:06:35.390]
Sheridan on passions?

[03:06:36.230 --> 03:06:36.870]
Oh, man.

[03:06:37.930 --> 03:06:39.230]
See, you know, watch the show.

[03:06:39.330 --> 03:06:40.250]
See, I have no idea who that is.

[03:06:40.290 --> 03:06:41.550]
I don't know what the actress's name is.

[03:06:42.730 --> 03:06:44.330]
But she is a knockout.

[03:06:44.490 --> 03:06:47.350]
Allison Mack is the name of the girl on Smallville, the blonde.

[03:06:48.070 --> 03:06:48.370]
That's right.

[03:06:48.550 --> 03:06:49.430]
I think she's pretty hot.

[03:06:49.690 --> 03:06:50.290]
She is pretty hot.

[03:06:50.750 --> 03:06:51.990]
No one will know who she is.

[03:06:52.610 --> 03:06:53.750]
She's worthy, but no one.

[03:06:53.750 --> 03:06:55.330]
Does she know Johnny and Mack by the railroad track?

[03:06:55.810 --> 03:06:56.970]
They didn't do 12 in last poll.

[03:06:57.070 --> 03:06:57.670]
Let's try this time.

[03:06:57.910 --> 03:06:58.730]
Now we're not putting her on there.

[03:07:00.770 --> 03:07:01.110]
Jesse...

[03:07:01.110 --> 03:07:01.950]
Cut, Alva.

[03:07:02.730 --> 03:07:03.950]
Jesse's girl, Rick Springfield.

[03:07:04.830 --> 03:07:05.550]
It'll come to me.

[03:07:06.190 --> 03:07:08.330]
19-1 at 560 W.Q.M.

[03:07:08.370 --> 03:07:10.290]
The number one Chinese buffet in the universe is the

[03:07:10.290 --> 03:07:11.610]
Emerald Coge Chinese buffet.

[03:07:11.790 --> 03:07:13.010]
This isn't just for like a snack.

[03:07:13.650 --> 03:07:15.150]
This is for when you got a really big appetite.

[03:07:15.150 --> 03:07:16.410]
You want to really go and pick out.

[03:07:16.530 --> 03:07:18.430]
And I'm not talking about just a bunch of mushy stuff,

[03:07:18.710 --> 03:07:20.910]
just to fill up that vacant pit in the middle of your stomach.

[03:07:21.170 --> 03:07:23.090]
We're talking about delicious food, crunchy and fresh.

[03:07:24.350 --> 03:07:25.810]
They got three locations for you.

Find Emerald Coast in sunrise.

[03:07:27.330 --> 03:07:28.090]
They're in North Miami Beach.

And their newest location is in prestigious Pembroke Pines.

[03:07:33.870 --> 03:07:35.110]

entrees, including Oriental Surf and Turf on the weekends.

New York Stiffstake made order the gourmet center.

[03:07:43.570 --> 03:07:45.410]
And you've got to make a pit stop at the gourmet center

[03:07:45.410 --> 03:07:46.550]
because it's fantastic.

[03:07:46.790 --> 03:07:49.490]
It's a sizzling Asian grill featuring teriyaki steak,

[03:07:49.770 --> 03:07:51.270]
shrimp chicken seafood, hand-carved primord.

[03:07:51.610 --> 03:07:53.010]
The Emerald Coast bro is healthy living too.

[03:07:53.110 --> 03:07:55.890]
No MSG, no cornstarch, and no oil that's loaded with crap.

[03:07:56.030 --> 03:07:57.450]
Only cholesterol free oils and all the cooking.

There's a new sushi bar, fresh shrimp cocktail too.

And the famous lobster fest is back at Emerald Coast,

[03:08:04.430 --> 03:08:07.110]
featuring lobster thermators and lobster bisque as well.

[03:08:07.470 --> 03:08:09.510]
Try to leave some room for dessert because they got a fantastic

[03:08:09.510 --> 03:08:12.470]
dessert bar with pies, cakes, pastries, ice cream

[03:08:12.470 --> 03:08:13.830]
with all your favorite toppings.

[03:08:14.210 --> 03:08:14.970]
What's this happening there?

[03:08:15.610 --> 03:08:15.790]
Oops.

[03:08:16.270 --> 03:08:16.870]
What'd you just do?

[03:08:17.150 --> 03:08:18.690]
He's dicking with my mic again.

[03:08:19.990 --> 03:08:20.610]
He's dicking around.

[03:08:20.730 --> 03:08:22.170]
I didn't even tell you what's happening with Sheridan

[03:08:22.170 --> 03:08:22.590]
Parsons.

[03:08:24.090 --> 03:08:26.710]
Anyway, pies, cakes, pastries, ice cream with all your favorite

[03:08:26.710 --> 03:08:28.710]
toppings, even fresh fruit, even watermelon,

[03:08:28.990 --> 03:08:31.190]
and the perfect menu to an unforgettable pick-out.

[03:08:31.310 --> 03:08:32.710]
Not just a meal, a pick-out.

[03:08:32.710 --> 03:08:34.430]
When in doubt, go pick out of the Emerald Coast.

[03:08:34.810 --> 03:08:36.570]

[03:08:36.910 --> 03:08:39.270]

[03:08:46.990 --> 03:08:49.990]
call them at 9.5.4.5723822.

[03:08:50.310 --> 03:08:52.570]
Tell Richard Goldeafs go and be sure and start doing it quick

[03:08:52.570 --> 03:08:54.870]
because they're fading like the numbers.

[03:08:55.270 --> 03:09:00.410]
That's 9.5.4.5723822 for the world famous Emerald Coast Chinese buffet.

[03:09:00.410 --> 03:09:03.850]
Five and a local, big 60s, five cities.

[03:09:04.370 --> 03:09:05.810]
The radio's on your...

[03:09:05.810 --> 03:09:07.770]
...2 a.m.

[03:09:09.770 --> 03:09:11.710]
A disgusting program.

[03:09:12.350 --> 03:09:15.250]
I urge everyone to complain to this station.

[03:09:17.490 --> 03:09:20.910]
I know. We're cordoned in front of a taped audience.

[03:09:21.210 --> 03:09:24.650]
It's a beautiful, televised, sunny Hollywood, California.

[03:09:27.450 --> 03:09:29.250]
Disturbed by an angel.

[03:09:29.250 --> 03:09:31.130]
Oh, my God.

[03:09:33.250 --> 03:09:33.330]
Kathy?

[03:09:33.730 --> 03:09:34.290]
Yes, Mom?

[03:09:34.610 --> 03:09:37.670]
Are you having that not-so-fresh feeling?

[03:09:38.370 --> 03:09:39.430]
How'd you know?

[03:09:39.810 --> 03:09:41.150]
Mom's know these things.

[03:09:42.910 --> 03:09:43.590]
Hello?

[03:09:44.070 --> 03:09:45.670]
Oh, it's you.

[03:09:45.950 --> 03:09:46.990]
Don't come over here.

[03:09:47.190 --> 03:09:48.530]
Mom, who's that?

[03:09:49.830 --> 03:09:51.670]
It's...it's Delegrease, Mom.

[03:09:52.690 --> 03:09:53.810]
What's she doing?

[03:09:54.410 --> 03:09:55.610]
I got a scream.

[03:09:56.130 --> 03:09:57.450]
That not-so-fresh feeling.

[03:09:57.450 --> 03:09:57.690]
You're right.

[03:09:58.430 --> 03:09:59.210]
You're breath.

[03:10:00.510 --> 03:10:01.950]
I can't breathe.

[03:10:02.130 --> 03:10:04.410]
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus!

[03:10:04.630 --> 03:10:05.710]
Mom, what's she doing?

[03:10:06.290 --> 03:10:07.090]
Make her stop!

[03:10:07.770 --> 03:10:09.550]
Mom, I just made a mistake.

[03:10:09.710 --> 03:10:11.170]
Let me get this in that.

[03:10:12.010 --> 03:10:13.370]
Oh, Mom?

[03:10:14.010 --> 03:10:14.690]
Have I?

[03:10:14.790 --> 03:10:15.430]
Yes, Kathy.

[03:10:16.290 --> 03:10:18.450]
You've been dused by an angel.

[03:10:18.850 --> 03:10:19.510]
Oh, Mom?

[03:10:19.870 --> 03:10:20.590]
Oh, Kathy?

[03:10:21.010 --> 03:10:21.870]
Oh, Stella.

[03:10:22.110 --> 03:10:23.090]
Turn in next week.

[03:10:23.310 --> 03:10:27.330]
And find out what happens when Delegrease meets Mr. T from the 18.

[03:10:27.330 --> 03:10:27.830]
What?

[03:10:28.210 --> 03:10:29.090]
You want us to get in, my?

[03:10:29.710 --> 03:10:32.030]
All next week on Stegi-Eggs!

[03:10:34.350 --> 03:10:35.910]
1246 at 560 W. Crim.

[03:10:35.990 --> 03:10:40.710]
Here's the fact that George Gorge's Roma Downey is old, fat and black question mark.

[03:10:40.890 --> 03:10:44.390]
You appear to be confusing her with dused by an angel, coast, our Delegrease.

[03:10:44.710 --> 03:10:45.650]
Come back to what it says.

[03:10:46.050 --> 03:10:46.430]
Oh, sorry.

[03:10:46.830 --> 03:10:47.230]
Switch those.

[03:10:48.970 --> 03:10:51.070]
So in other words, you thought we were talking about Delegrease?

[03:10:51.570 --> 03:10:51.710]
Yes.

[03:10:51.730 --> 03:10:54.310]
It was about 100 years old and Aunt Yamama looking?

[03:10:54.570 --> 03:10:55.270]
Well, they always were their names.

[03:10:55.270 --> 03:10:57.130]
So Roma Downey is who is she on air?

[03:10:57.230 --> 03:10:57.350]
No.

[03:10:57.710 --> 03:10:58.310]
No, still?

[03:10:58.790 --> 03:11:01.970]
She's a handsome woman, but never the last time.

[03:11:01.970 --> 03:11:02.590]
She's a hot.

[03:11:02.950 --> 03:11:04.110]
Kind of like me Kimba, like that.

[03:11:04.290 --> 03:11:05.130]
And not like that.

[03:11:05.410 --> 03:11:06.790]
Oh, here she is.

[03:11:06.930 --> 03:11:07.530]
Very handsome.

[03:11:07.690 --> 03:11:07.910]
You're right.

[03:11:08.010 --> 03:11:08.810]
Roma Downey, a picture.

[03:11:09.310 --> 03:11:10.390]
A classy regal looking.

[03:11:10.410 --> 03:11:11.410]
You're saying a voice.

[03:11:11.830 --> 03:11:12.550]
You're trying to say a voice.

[03:11:12.950 --> 03:11:13.390]
No, no.

[03:11:13.610 --> 03:11:14.170]
Yes, you are.

[03:11:14.310 --> 03:11:19.870]
The first one that says from T. R. North, my miscarina Williams is absolutely flat out, says he puts her in a Williams on her.

[03:11:19.870 --> 03:11:20.070]
Okay.

[03:11:21.470 --> 03:11:24.710]
I keep her voglée out of my desk for some lunchtime pleasure.

[03:11:25.270 --> 03:11:28.750]
And her essence mag layout was nice, but the pages are all, I can't even read it.

[03:11:28.830 --> 03:11:29.070]
Sticky.

[03:11:29.190 --> 03:11:31.510]
I can't read it because even this is like stuck over.

[03:11:31.830 --> 03:11:33.350]
Anyway, she's amazingly hot to a lot of us.

[03:11:33.590 --> 03:11:37.090]
Here's the rub when you have a pose, you forget there are darkies who make up a good set of your audience.

[03:11:37.210 --> 03:11:38.330]
They really just gloss over.

[03:11:39.850 --> 03:11:41.330]
Did you put Serena Williams on there or not?

[03:11:41.690 --> 03:11:42.030]
Yes, he did.

[03:11:42.050 --> 03:11:42.930]
You better get with it, mister.

[03:11:44.110 --> 03:11:45.850]
A two-pack would have gotten a first set of votes.

[03:11:45.850 --> 03:11:47.670]
And I'm sure Serena would have outdo quite a few in a pool now.

[03:11:47.670 --> 03:11:50.110]
But it's your show entertainer, so I suppose, and I try to contribute.

[03:11:50.370 --> 03:11:51.110]
Well, they'll feel so bad.

[03:11:51.230 --> 03:11:52.630]
Don't go off with your tail between your legs.

[03:11:53.070 --> 03:11:55.310]
We put Serena on there, even though I think she's rather...

[03:11:55.310 --> 03:11:55.970]
What do you know?

[03:11:56.110 --> 03:11:57.070]
Whatever, crunch your boat, man.

[03:11:58.470 --> 03:12:00.090]
I mean, Halle Berry wasn't exactly...

[03:12:00.090 --> 03:12:01.870]
Why does the fall and snow last time I checked her out?

[03:12:02.150 --> 03:12:06.490]
Race has got no factor in this, but if Serena is what you like, they got tire banks and they owe me Campbell.

[03:12:07.190 --> 03:12:07.450]
Right.

[03:12:08.090 --> 03:12:08.870]
Who else do we have?

[03:12:08.890 --> 03:12:11.370]
We discussed Harry Belafonte's daughter, but she's too old for you now.

[03:12:11.890 --> 03:12:12.150]
Shuri.

[03:12:13.870 --> 03:12:14.190]
Metcalf.

[03:12:14.290 --> 03:12:15.170]
Who the hell is Metcalf?

[03:12:15.170 --> 03:12:17.710]
It just says Metcalf.

[03:12:18.470 --> 03:12:19.030]
I don't know.

[03:12:19.350 --> 03:12:20.750]
I remember Mike, I metcalf.

[03:12:21.190 --> 03:12:23.150]
Here's one that says 20 years ago, Bobby Hall.

[03:12:23.530 --> 03:12:24.050]
20 years ago.

[03:12:24.890 --> 03:12:25.830]
How about you, Dory?

[03:12:25.970 --> 03:12:27.290]
He was pretty good about 20 years ago.

[03:12:28.850 --> 03:12:30.770]
I met that's from our friend who used to work for the hero.

[03:12:30.890 --> 03:12:31.290]
What's your name?

[03:12:31.390 --> 03:12:31.950]
That from Detroit.

[03:12:32.710 --> 03:12:34.870]
They used to be our good friend that we've missed for years and years now.

[03:12:35.250 --> 03:12:35.710]
Our lady friend.

[03:12:37.270 --> 03:12:38.150]
Rachel, I'll look to Andrew.

[03:12:38.490 --> 03:12:38.750]
No!

[03:12:41.190 --> 03:12:43.310]
Our lady friend who used to work at the hero

[03:12:43.310 --> 03:12:46.770]
in the action line who used to bring me the Vic Burton CDs all the time.

[03:12:47.110 --> 03:12:47.630]
And Kathy.

[03:12:47.630 --> 03:12:48.270]
And, uh, Kathy.

[03:12:48.470 --> 03:12:49.090]
We live in good.

[03:12:49.730 --> 03:12:50.610]
Let's hear it for George.

[03:12:51.230 --> 03:12:52.330]
Kathy, let me just stand.

[03:12:54.230 --> 03:12:54.650]
Let's see.

[03:12:54.770 --> 03:12:55.950]
The big fat one is Delarist.

[03:12:55.990 --> 03:12:58.510]
This one is Roma Downey and the picture is like all night.

[03:12:58.510 --> 03:12:58.970]
Yeah, okay.

[03:12:59.650 --> 03:13:00.310]
Got my angels.

[03:13:01.310 --> 03:13:02.110]
Too much for George.

[03:13:02.110 --> 03:13:02.530]
You okay?

[03:13:02.590 --> 03:13:05.470]
We're sorry, but we are putting Serena on there because that brother's getting a little...

[03:13:05.470 --> 03:13:05.810]
And he's right.

[03:13:05.930 --> 03:13:08.390]
Too back should have been on there, but that was your fault for not making me put it on there.

[03:13:08.890 --> 03:13:10.050]
Well, let's put Biggie on there, too.

[03:13:10.510 --> 03:13:11.310]
Yeah, okay.

[03:13:11.310 --> 03:13:12.670]
Well, they should have both been on there.

[03:13:13.590 --> 03:13:14.150]
Well, guess what?

[03:13:14.250 --> 03:13:15.050]
Maybe we can do that again.

[03:13:15.210 --> 03:13:16.210]
And L.O. Cool, too.

[03:13:16.230 --> 03:13:17.090]
Like starting now.

[03:13:17.590 --> 03:13:17.750]
Right.

[03:13:18.150 --> 03:13:19.470]
And notorious O.M.

[03:13:19.510 --> 03:13:20.210]
And then it was on there?

[03:13:21.150 --> 03:13:22.210]
What about, uh, old dirty?

[03:13:23.210 --> 03:13:23.850]
Yeah, old dirty.

[03:13:25.230 --> 03:13:25.930]
About 50, man.

[03:13:26.310 --> 03:13:26.690]
About 30.

[03:13:28.230 --> 03:13:31.310]
560, 705, 60, 05, 60 on EAT&T.

[03:13:32.350 --> 03:13:33.370]
And Verizon Wireless Line.

[03:13:33.670 --> 03:13:34.490]
Thanks so much to Howard.

[03:13:34.490 --> 03:13:38.690]
Whatever his name was, the hero for that big puppies on light 101.5.

[03:13:39.110 --> 03:13:40.850]
And the all-female dish-juck, he's on there.

[03:13:40.850 --> 03:13:43.310]
And if it makes any difference, people who want to hear a slush,

[03:13:43.470 --> 03:13:45.750]
it would make any difference if they had many mouse on there.

[03:13:45.870 --> 03:13:46.230]
You know what I'm saying?

[03:13:47.670 --> 03:13:48.470]
Introducing the songs.

[03:13:49.850 --> 03:13:53.470]
In fact, to be honest with it, it would make any difference if they had Mickey Mouse.

[03:13:53.730 --> 03:13:54.350]
Oh, I snore.

[03:13:54.550 --> 03:13:56.850]
Calling, uh, calling, uh, whatever his name is.

[03:13:57.970 --> 03:13:59.810]
Ah, I mean, Dad's just getting nervous every time I do that.

[03:13:59.910 --> 03:14:01.750]
Don't forget tomorrow, I'll get that under like a separate video.

[03:14:02.170 --> 03:14:02.990]
Right after the show is better.

[03:14:03.070 --> 03:14:05.790]
So we don't have to, like, keep embarrassing me for my technical incompetence.

[03:14:06.610 --> 03:14:07.250]
Jesse, uh...

[03:14:07.250 --> 03:14:07.570]
Ventura.

[03:14:08.050 --> 03:14:08.370]
Ventura.

[03:14:08.530 --> 03:14:09.370]
Now, what the hell is his name?

[03:14:09.370 --> 03:14:10.030]
Now I'm upset.

[03:14:10.370 --> 03:14:11.170]
And you never looked it up.

[03:14:12.090 --> 03:14:13.170]
Never looked up passions.

[03:14:13.390 --> 03:14:14.390]
What's wrong with you, Carlos?

[03:14:15.310 --> 03:14:16.210]
Boy, where should we start?

[03:14:18.350 --> 03:14:19.030]
The cap.

[03:14:20.490 --> 03:14:21.490]
The eyebrow ring.

[03:14:22.890 --> 03:14:26.170]
That's gonna be our pulled-amour-all-carlos, cap-on or cap-on.

[03:14:27.890 --> 03:14:29.090]
Or just, K?

[03:14:30.730 --> 03:14:32.230]
Just look up real quick passions.

[03:14:32.250 --> 03:14:33.310]
It'll have the cast on there.

[03:14:33.410 --> 03:14:34.290]
You got Luis and Miguel.

[03:14:34.410 --> 03:14:34.870]
Luis Miguel.

[03:14:35.550 --> 03:14:36.830]
Part of the sick humor under here.

[03:14:36.890 --> 03:14:39.050]
You got Antonio and Pilar.

[03:14:39.050 --> 03:14:39.770]
Who's from down here.

[03:14:39.830 --> 03:14:42.810]
Remember that woman I call that day and tell us that the woman who plays Pilar on her,

[03:14:42.830 --> 03:14:45.470]
who is the mama of all three of them and Teresa?

[03:14:46.130 --> 03:14:47.090]
She's from down here.

[03:14:47.450 --> 03:14:48.310]
She's one of us.

[03:14:48.490 --> 03:14:48.770]
Well, you.

[03:14:49.450 --> 03:14:50.550]
I say she's great.

[03:14:50.870 --> 03:14:51.490]
She's a hoot.

[03:14:51.530 --> 03:14:52.030]
She's a panic.

[03:14:52.890 --> 03:14:53.890]
Antonio, all me whole.

[03:14:54.090 --> 03:14:55.270]
What are we gonna do, me whole?

[03:14:55.390 --> 03:14:56.050]
She's a panic.

[03:14:56.630 --> 03:15:01.010]
You better start watching that show because pretty soon you're gonna start losing touch with what we're talking about here.

[03:15:01.190 --> 03:15:02.130]
And that'll be real bad.

[03:15:02.570 --> 03:15:05.150]
We just can't talk about babes with hot, big boobs every day.

[03:15:06.610 --> 03:15:07.430]
You got it yet?

[03:15:07.650 --> 03:15:09.090]
Jesse, come on.

[03:15:09.250 --> 03:15:09.490]
Let's go.

[03:15:09.650 --> 03:15:10.030]
It's passions.

[03:15:10.250 --> 03:15:11.610]
You don't have the cast of passions.

[03:15:11.810 --> 03:15:12.550]
It's taking...

[03:15:12.550 --> 03:15:14.190]
This is our computer wizard, by the way.

[03:15:14.390 --> 03:15:15.790]
No wonder Eric hates you like poison.

[03:15:16.910 --> 03:15:19.910]
And makes fun of you and says your little punk wouldn't know a computer from your ass.

[03:15:21.190 --> 03:15:22.770]
Nine minutes till one at five, 60.

[03:15:22.930 --> 03:15:25.130]
The world famous mad dog is coming up at one o'clock.

[03:15:25.170 --> 03:15:25.530]
Oh, right.

[03:15:25.630 --> 03:15:26.730]
And you don't mess with a mad dog.

[03:15:27.430 --> 03:15:29.890]
Even if he got his 20 bucks in your pocket or what's left of it, Carlos?

[03:15:30.730 --> 03:15:31.270]
Snow and Miami.

[03:15:31.450 --> 03:15:31.750]
That's right.

[03:15:31.750 --> 03:15:38.570]
Tom Lehman and Joe Prieto over there at Halipada, they got so many cars on the lot they got no place to stick them.

[03:15:38.810 --> 03:15:40.630]
Even Tom Lehman had a park some cars in his driveway.

[03:15:41.210 --> 03:15:42.110]
So obviously...

[03:15:42.110 --> 03:15:42.610]
That's what that's called.

[03:15:42.790 --> 03:15:43.070]
Tom, that cat.

[03:15:43.230 --> 03:15:44.050]
Thank you so much.

[03:15:44.290 --> 03:15:45.370]
Oh, Jesse met cat.

[03:15:45.570 --> 03:15:45.870]
Thank you.

[03:15:46.210 --> 03:15:47.450]
Mike met cat with the harness driver.

[03:15:48.150 --> 03:15:49.570]
See, and I didn't even put it together.

[03:15:50.710 --> 03:15:52.370]
Boy, oh boy, I'm slipping bad.

[03:15:52.690 --> 03:15:53.390]
Sorry, Tom Lehman.

[03:15:53.490 --> 03:15:56.210]
Right in the middle of your spot, I realized that I'm on the way out just like David Brinkley.

[03:15:56.490 --> 03:15:58.030]
Maybe Tom Lehman will carry me around.

[03:15:58.190 --> 03:15:59.390]
You know, he's a good guy, likes this show.

[03:15:59.790 --> 03:16:02.950]
Anyway, they got so many cars on the lot they want to stick one in yours in your driveway.

[03:16:03.150 --> 03:16:08.570]
That is, Halipada's is blowing out all the new vehicles regardless of profit, including the Pontiac Vibes,

[03:16:08.670 --> 03:16:14.690]
starting at a very measly $13,998, and up to $5,000 off on a Regim Cyanboy in stock.

[03:16:15.070 --> 03:16:19.250]
Plus, it's a 0% financing or up to a $3,000 rebate.

[03:16:19.570 --> 03:16:22.830]
And of course, as always, Halips got a...it seems like a C of automobiles there,

[03:16:23.110 --> 03:16:26.810]
a dependable selection of pre-owned cars, trucks and SUVs that almost goes on forever.

[03:16:26.810 --> 03:16:31.010]
And if anybody else in town says you're not good enough for them, the good news is that Halipada Pontiac,

[03:16:31.050 --> 03:16:35.810]
you are always good enough for those folks because they'll cut you deal even if you have crappy credit or no credit at all.

[03:16:36.170 --> 03:16:40.290]
It's the litter-blizzard emergency clearance level on right now at Halipada Pontiac GMC,

[03:16:40.430 --> 03:16:45.190]
134-1 South Dixie Highway, that's US-1 Red Cross Street from the falls open every single day,

[03:16:45.430 --> 03:16:46.270]
seven days a week.

[03:16:46.330 --> 03:16:48.850]
And if you mention the Arranger Show, they'll even save you some more cash.

[03:16:49.190 --> 03:16:54.150]
Call the Near Rogers Neal Deal Hotline right now at 1-888-534-4211.

[03:16:54.150 --> 03:16:56.890]
That's 1-888-534-4211.

[03:16:57.050 --> 03:16:58.430]
Talk to Jesse Metcalf when you call.

[03:17:00.510 --> 03:17:02.590]
What's wrong with that? Maybe Jesse's there selling cars.

[03:17:02.850 --> 03:17:04.410]
You never know. They got a good sense of humor.

[03:17:04.730 --> 03:17:07.150]
And Halipada Pontiac GMC who'll be professional grade...

[03:17:10.230 --> 03:17:13.450]
...their sports radio 560-2AM.

[03:17:15.290 --> 03:17:16.670]
Don't get big in the boat, Ellen.

[03:17:47.150 --> 03:17:48.890]
Blamping your lips like Ann.

[03:17:49.170 --> 03:17:51.950]
Golders rose green. Fox News Heather.

[03:17:52.850 --> 03:17:54.890]
We really like to f**k you.

[03:17:55.570 --> 03:17:58.930]
Oh yeah. Fox News Heather.

[03:17:59.650 --> 03:18:01.710]
We really like to f**k you.

[03:18:02.430 --> 03:18:04.250]
We really like to f**k you.

[03:18:05.290 --> 03:18:07.050]
Do you ever think about doing that, Elisa?

[03:18:07.350 --> 03:18:08.610]
Do you think that's you?

[03:18:09.670 --> 03:18:11.110]
You want to touch him?

[03:18:11.490 --> 03:18:11.950]
Three-way.

[03:18:13.210 --> 03:18:14.650]
You're not going to miss it.

[03:18:14.910 --> 03:18:16.570]
You should make me go, ma'am.

[03:18:17.470 --> 03:18:21.290]
The listen picked rose but between your punks.

[03:18:21.450 --> 03:18:24.230]
I'll bet it tastes like bubble gum.

[03:18:25.050 --> 03:18:27.630]
See you next time you need a story done.

[03:18:28.150 --> 03:18:31.270]
Since it takes a bit for you to make you come.

[03:18:32.050 --> 03:18:33.150]
Fox News Heather.

[03:18:33.810 --> 03:18:36.010]
We really like to f**k you.

[03:18:36.770 --> 03:18:37.430]
Oh yeah.

[03:18:38.570 --> 03:18:40.030]
Fox News Heather.

[03:18:40.850 --> 03:18:42.870]
We really like to f**k you.

[03:18:42.990 --> 03:18:45.310]
You'll be pleased to know she's got the three votes Fox News Heather.

[03:18:45.450 --> 03:18:46.570]
She's way down to the small potatoes.

[03:18:47.090 --> 03:18:49.070]
The hottest person public figure in the world.

[03:18:49.070 --> 03:18:52.330]
People that everybody knows Britney Spears 72, Halley Berry 71.

[03:18:52.410 --> 03:18:53.570]
Looks like they're dealing with that result.

[03:18:53.770 --> 03:18:56.330]
Keep it us on the edge of our seats just like passions.

[03:18:57.070 --> 03:18:58.730]
And Jesse Metcalf.

[03:18:59.510 --> 03:19:00.990]
Well, you know, it just, it doesn't fit in.

[03:19:01.050 --> 03:19:02.450]
Metcalf is not a Hispanic name.

[03:19:03.170 --> 03:19:05.790]
Of course neither is Lopez-Slaish Fitzgerald.

[03:19:05.930 --> 03:19:07.450]
But there's a little Hispanic in him, you know.

[03:19:08.590 --> 03:19:10.030]
That's what Antonio said.

[03:19:10.430 --> 03:19:13.090]
Anyway, Britney's got 72, Halley's 71.

[03:19:13.370 --> 03:19:16.110]
And according to Julia 62, she's kind of fading.

[03:19:17.830 --> 03:19:19.030]
Elizabeth Hurley 54.

[03:19:19.650 --> 03:19:21.950]
Jackie Johnson, Channel 7 Weather Babes got 43.

[03:19:22.110 --> 03:19:22.510]
You go girl.

[03:19:22.870 --> 03:19:23.870]
Carmen Lector 38.

[03:19:25.030 --> 03:19:25.670]
You go away girl.

[03:19:26.470 --> 03:19:26.910]
Chenaya 24.

[03:19:27.610 --> 03:19:30.130]
Penelope Cruz rhymes with Schmous.

[03:19:30.610 --> 03:19:31.710]
32 and Luz.

[03:19:32.030 --> 03:19:33.350]
Catherine Zeta, Jones 26.

[03:19:33.650 --> 03:19:34.590]
Why does she say Zeta?

[03:19:34.590 --> 03:19:36.350]
You know what he says Zeta?

[03:19:37.410 --> 03:19:39.250]
Maybe she's eaten too much baked Zeta.

[03:19:39.590 --> 03:19:40.250]
You think that would be?

[03:19:40.490 --> 03:19:41.510]
Maybe she's a Guida.

[03:19:43.450 --> 03:19:46.390]
Jennifer Garner's got 30 for 20 from Alias.

[03:19:46.850 --> 03:19:48.750]
JLo's got 18, which shocks me.

[03:19:49.650 --> 03:19:52.070]
A lot of guys like that big, big smelly ass.

[03:19:52.370 --> 03:19:53.430]
Maybe some chicks voted for her.

[03:19:53.450 --> 03:19:54.410]
Jennifer Conley's 16.

[03:19:54.490 --> 03:19:55.130]
That could be it.

[03:19:55.250 --> 03:19:56.690]
Catherine Bulldike out there.

[03:19:56.950 --> 03:19:57.890]
Sharon Stone's 16.

[03:19:59.030 --> 03:19:59.910]
Brad Pitt 15.

[03:20:00.490 --> 03:20:01.350]
Cameron Diaz 12.

[03:20:03.630 --> 03:20:06.110]
Charlize Theron Devils advocate two days in a valley 11.

[03:20:06.450 --> 03:20:07.550]
How come she gets a whole lot?

[03:20:07.610 --> 03:20:08.670]
Because they're not going to know who she is right.

[03:20:09.690 --> 03:20:10.590]
Liv Tyler 9.

[03:20:10.890 --> 03:20:11.530]
Tom Brady 8.

[03:20:11.730 --> 03:20:13.990]
He's been stuck on 8 for a long time, poor Tommy.

[03:20:14.850 --> 03:20:15.810]
Heather Lockley Raid.

[03:20:16.150 --> 03:20:18.030]
Kristen Cruck from Smallville's got 7.

[03:20:18.590 --> 03:20:19.250]
Little Lana.

[03:20:19.690 --> 03:20:20.870]
Then he's Richard's got 6.

[03:20:21.210 --> 03:20:22.110]
Tom mollens up to 6.

[03:20:22.930 --> 03:20:24.030]
Keep moving on it, Tom.

[03:20:24.470 --> 03:20:25.990]
He needs to work out a little bit, you know.

[03:20:26.970 --> 03:20:28.250]
He needs to pump it up a little bit.

[03:20:29.930 --> 03:20:32.750]
And if Condra want to pump it up, maybe some of us will help him.

[03:20:33.630 --> 03:20:35.510]
Lucy Lou from Charlie's Angels 6.

[03:20:35.870 --> 03:20:36.710]
We love Lucy Lou.

[03:20:37.450 --> 03:20:40.050]
I have no idea who that is, but I still love her because I love that name.

[03:20:40.550 --> 03:20:42.050]
I wish they all I would have been like Lucy Lou.

[03:20:42.810 --> 03:20:44.010]
Maybe we'll change the name of the show now.

[03:20:44.130 --> 03:20:45.070]
Loose like a show.

[03:20:45.090 --> 03:20:45.270]
Asian girl.

[03:20:46.630 --> 03:20:47.510]
Johnny Depp 6.

[03:20:47.710 --> 03:20:48.650]
Antonio Savito Jr.

[03:20:48.870 --> 03:20:49.310]
Got 6.

[03:20:49.790 --> 03:20:50.770]
Would have one eye to the sky.

[03:20:51.250 --> 03:20:52.450]
Christina Aguilar has got 6.

[03:20:52.550 --> 03:20:53.310]
No, I'm not playing that again.

[03:20:53.770 --> 03:20:54.530]
Faith Hill's got 6.

[03:20:54.910 --> 03:20:56.190]
Jamie Pressley's got 5.

[03:20:57.030 --> 03:20:57.850]
Oh, brother.

Fox News Heather have 3.

[03:21:05.590 --> 03:21:06.230]
And with a pair.

[03:21:07.390 --> 03:21:09.390]
What do we got about 600 names on here?

[03:21:09.710 --> 03:21:12.650]
Julien Blaylock, Beyonce Knowles, Aheath Ledger.

[03:21:13.950 --> 03:21:18.690]
Jenna Jamison, Natasha Hensridge, Sophia Vergara, and Brooke, Brooke, Brooke.

[03:21:19.090 --> 03:21:19.670]

[03:21:20.170 --> 03:21:23.210]
And last but not least, one, Leah Rimene, Soma Hayek.

[03:21:23.550 --> 03:21:27.830]
Marty Havelad, Nick Lache, Leshe, Natalie Portman, and Jessica Elles.

[03:21:27.830 --> 03:21:29.530]
And with 0, several.

[03:21:30.330 --> 03:21:31.610]
Do I need even deer mention with 0?

[03:21:32.510 --> 03:21:32.830]
No.

[03:21:33.330 --> 03:21:34.690]
Do I want to, that would be like rubbing it in.

[03:21:34.890 --> 03:21:35.950]
That would be like piling on.

[03:21:36.630 --> 03:21:37.130]
Wouldn't it?

[03:21:37.930 --> 03:21:39.970]
So take a look at that 660 votes.

[03:21:40.190 --> 03:21:44.430]
As we continue our search for the hottest person in the world that we want to just reach out and grab around.

[03:21:44.510 --> 03:21:44.950]
You know what I'm saying?

[03:21:46.070 --> 03:21:49.330]
And just put our hand in the shoulder like, you know, just be good friends.

[03:21:50.870 --> 03:21:55.830]
Just pat him on the back and say, just the fact that you were alive makes me feel better about life.

[03:21:55.890 --> 03:21:56.710]
Bye, bye, bye.

[03:21:57.830 --> 03:22:01.510]
Watch your show on time, 660, and QAM might be for a lot of data.

[03:22:01.690 --> 03:22:04.630]
When you put it in your mouth, it doesn't stick to your tongue.
