I was going to call for we all my God. Please lend me your hand. Give me a helping hand

[00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.280]
This is a care package

[00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.620]
I've been waiting for weeks. I saw the camera game on TV last time. Are you sure?

[00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.480]

[00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.840]
If I could tell you well, we've gone through here. Of course you've gone through some good stuff up into it. Still have refogs

[00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.940]
Phil Henry remember him

[00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:32.580]
You're saying who yeah

[00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.660]
You saw if you got the floor something I just woke up. It's panorcloth. I get off your at midnight

[00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.220]
No, she's still in she's finished in school in Minnesota. Oh, oh

[00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:56.180]
So I have a one-room flat somewhere in the Rose Bowl country. It's really weird. It's rain passadena

[00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.960]
Yeah, I'm in passadena. It's a little old talk host from passadena. Yeah, and

[00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.260]
Right. It's about 50 degrees. It's pouring rain. So when are you coming back?

[00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:12.440]
I hear you were predicting a year. I think maybe a little probably be about right. Why is that? Are they giving you a bunch of crap? No

[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:13.640]
I they're on having a good time

[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.220]
But I'm listening to people calling me up here saying your meals on the air saying you're fucking wind out there

[00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.580]
I never said that's a lot of crap. I never said that well

[00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.940]
Steve Nichol your good post personal friend is the one I keep going on here

[00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.280]
And his 85 different talk shows that we got because he's got all these vacant gaps. He can't fill in

[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.480]
And it's all he talks about is how you're never going to make it out there and they're giving you a bunch of crap

[00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.320]
I don't know why he would do the other way. He would I never said that

[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.680]
I there was a there was a blurb in the paper

[00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:45.160]
There too after you started and they said you know about the first day and they started bitching about the language and about the

[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.200]
She killed bit and all of the service stuff

[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.880]
Well, I don't use

[00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.080]
30 language affection. No, dammit and

[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.020]
What the characters that I use do you say you say asshole?

[00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.000]
Uh, I believe Harvey wireman once or twice. Oh, yeah, but I don't you don't

[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.180]
Even if it's a fake voice doing it. It's a little it's a little nut for lost Angela's

[00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:12.280]
The place like WIOD. I know it sounds like WID used to be right? Well, I don't know

[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.900]
I think people just don't people don't I talk to people about the station about how it wasn't Miami

[00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.740]
They don't even understand they never happen again film

[00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.160]
It never there will never again in the history of our business be what we had it was great

[00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.420]
But what happened back? Uh when you come back

[00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.080]
When I'm not joking. I'm serious. What time can you be in the plan? I'll pick you up personal to your point

[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.680]
I don't know man. I think you know if I keep one of a limo for you

[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:43.400]
I don't know. It's uh, I can't I can't keep living my life this way. I'm 44. I gotta start living so are they here?

[00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:49.460]
Are like the packing well so to speak or they uh, you know they should be the program director's yours a guy named David hall and

[00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.240]
wrongly. I thought they were hall voices and now everybody thinks he's a complete swine

[00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:00.020]
Um, and Tony was the first night time actually is a great animal. Yeah

[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.240]
What am I hearing there is that for free?

[00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.620]
Yeah

[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.900]
It's a thing. It's a computer. It does like a

[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:15.840]
The late motor like that like it. I'm listening to you at highlight. We finally got our DCS in here after weeks and weeks and

[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:21.380]
now we're railing and gnashing our teeth and screaming and yelling. It's unbelievable. You guys were using carts instead?

[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.640]
Well, we were using we were using a thing called the audio vault which is okay except that

[00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.540]
It doesn't do what we needed to do. You know what I'm saying? It looks very impressive

[00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.700]
And you can store like about 10 different things in there, but if you're still more than 10 things you can never find them

[00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.260]
So there's three six to you. Can you do this with a phone collar? Can you make them?

[00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:45.380]
No, no, it's just a computer that you store a drop engine. You know like I poop my poop

[00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.020]
I poop my pants

[00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.000]
Like that, you know, it's great

[00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.100]
It's a terrific. Well, we got a lot of real good-looking stuff in here

[00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.880]
A lot of it doesn't work, but they're too busy a binop 400 other radio stations this week

[00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.300]
So in fact, there was a trend that you know the book came out which I'm sure you must know and we all made bonus

[00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:06.080]
I heard I haven't gotten the check yet, but why not? Yeah, I got a lot of things up

[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.760]
You haven't gotten the check yet. It's the 21st in November. I have not done my bonus check. No

[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.000]
You want to be kidding me. I'm sure it's an oversight. I'm sure

[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.560]
But I heard it was a good book. I don't know. What's a great? You're a phenomenal book

[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.960]
You say there's a trend just just came out now. Well, we don't have any idea what it is

[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:31.480]
Now came out. I was on vacation. I was in Rome for nine days and I come back and I'm desperately asking and begging was there a trend

[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:35.600]
Yeah, and it even only came up with maybe even our PD doesn't know what it is

[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.980]
He hasn't gotten up off the floor long enough to find out what it was

[00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:43.000]
You know, but here we got this is the October September August trend

[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.840]
We got that like two days into November. It scared me. It's got here so fast

[00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:52.900]
Yeah, and I the program director says oh, we just got the October trend. I'm like it's only the second day of November

[00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.220]
Yeah, and I asked him what was it goes what it is in your trend man

[00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:01.220]
It was like it ends in the middle of October so it's not yours. Well, that's always good and I said thank you

[00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:07.000]
And went off the grid again, but the day after I got here we did a check that

[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.360]
I actually feel a little near on the air and you know the usual stuff

[00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.740]
And they threatened to sue the next day

[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.080]
We're on the air and and they're actually I talked to the lakers and told them what I was doing

[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.740]
They said I was a lot of graph basketball and that was the end of that. Oh, yes

[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.760]
So which I never saw again the general manager took him put in his office

[00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.600]
Yeah, if you get him on more he'd have a set that would be great

[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:31.360]
But

[00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:33.840]
Yeah, it's it's fun

[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:39.020]
So it's right by mr. Station mr. IOD because you don't have to look over your shoulder quite as much

[00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:42.880]
Or back there I didn't have to look over my shoulder quite as much. Yeah, one of that. Yeah

[00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:48.680]
What happened here in in Los Angeles? In fact here you look over your shoulder. You don't see anything. So it's great

[00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.380]
Yeah, they're but they're there

[00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.060]
We it's kind of like many apples here. It's like I'm

[00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:58.800]
On a staff of a fairly conservative sounding radio station and then in nine o'clock

[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:04.860]
The master of understate media. Yeah, it gets a little strange. So okay

[00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:06.260]
um

[00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:10.880]
That's the story. I mean, so you're doing okay. I am doing fine

[00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:14.700]
It's it's it's good to be home and and see all of my friends and

[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:21.480]
But I was calling I called George to see if the CDs were out or they in the store. Yes, they are and they're going like hotcakes

[00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:25.020]
I'd love to be able to get one and have it autographed by you or

[00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:31.900]
If the sea of growth. I said autographed for one of yours when we did I think of the fashion while we

[00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:35.800]
You know autograph that we had a very jismal turnout although where we're up to like about 50 grand

[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:39.520]
I'll rate say even the end of November so we're doing a real great on sale right yeah

[00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:43.720]
I think it's because they're in a border. You know and people just don't want to come out and see our every faces again

[00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:46.460]
For a fate. Yeah, seriously the fashion all was a disaster

[00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:50.320]
We had like almost nobody there and we still raised about nine grand. I don't know how the fashion

[00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:53.740]
We had a big thing at the pizza lot which we did well there this weekend with the sawgrass

[00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:57.580]
So we'll see we give the game based based on this this sawgrass idea has it

[00:06:58.340 --> 00:06:59.420]
California last week

[00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:02.460]
Now they got something called the Ontario mills ball

[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:09.080]
And they said this is a fantastic and unique concept in shopping and you've got to see this is a and I go

[00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:13.640]
It's a sawgrass mills ball. Look how let go joins you. Yeah, what is the mall out there?

[00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:19.260]
It's like um it's years ago that was there about 10 years ago, but it's like the biggest mall in the world

[00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:24.860]
Well, you can you in California? Yeah, we think of a mall of America in Minnesota. No, no

[00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:28.860]
Well, it may used to be maybe it's not any more the biggest but you know you've got to know what I'm talking about

[00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:32.780]
Somewhere LA. Yeah, there's the west west endless gallery

[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:38.300]
Glendale gallery other. Yeah, I think that's a gallery. Yeah, which is the

[00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:45.140]
It's disgusting. Well, they got a lot of really overpriced crap in there a whole bunch of junk and a lot of smog

[00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:46.760]
I don't know about this

[00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:52.460]
It was it was brutal for a while. Are you sure? It was a solid smog for a month. Yeah

[00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:54.020]
You know and

[00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:59.900]
And the people you know, I thought Miami they drove crazy in Miami and I forgot how nuts they are here

[00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:01.480]
You have a least they go somewhere there

[00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:07.900]
In the ghetto so when I go is it I leave it night. What is it in Watts? It's actually I shouldn't say the ghetto

[00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:16.000]
It's a working class part of Los Angeles called Korea town, but it is a part of the city they got burned during the 92 riots

[00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:22.920]
In fact, I don't know if you knew this but the the the closest KFI during the riots had to broadcast from a remote site because they had

[00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:25.200]
National guards around in the station

[00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:30.780]
So I leave there at I don't know 12 15 at night and I got to go up Normandy

[00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:35.680]
Which is the Normandy of course Normandy the flashpoint of the riot right and I'm doing like now

[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:38.080]
Yeah, it's it's brutal

[00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:44.840]
We don't have some of the old j-stuff started a nice couple a-sa I couldn't care when but everybody else thinks it's great

[00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:47.060]
So I guess I'm gonna have to talk about yeah, you got to do it

[00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:48.180]
but you know

[00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:49.260]
And

[00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:53.280]
Well our panthers are doing good one night night and

[00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:57.940]
I looked terrific and look really flat to me they played pretty crappy Kevin Stevens

[00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:00.020]
I think needs a couple more drinks will be all done

[00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:06.820]
Then the hockey games are out here they both do they both talk about 15 and night and neither one of them's any good

[00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:10.620]
No, but he is not drawing anybody are you kidding me? Well, they got 15,000

[00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:16.660]
For their last home game well that has to be the biggest part they've had all year because most of the games I've watched you could have your own section

[00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:20.620]
And they've been announcing like 12 5 and 12 8 they're not drawn

[00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:25.140]
And they the anion I'm putting the mighty ducks they do draw yeah, they're lucky

[00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:30.400]
But that's a Disney thing though. Yeah, but they do draw they just change the name of the angels to the anion

[00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:33.060]
Yeah, that's a term around yeah

[00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:36.680]
That'll really try to get an Austrian other 10 years

[00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:41.860]
So we got we I don't even want to tell you what's going on here because I don't want to get you to depressed

[00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:44.260]
Well, what do you mean in terms of the station in terms of it?

[00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:49.200]
Yeah, and to well in terms of all of the above you know, it's just when we first moved into the new studio over here

[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:53.940]
Which we got around do I think on the 10th of October and it you know like I said looked really

[00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:57.540]
Play-tool and they were like really so you know what can we do for you?

[00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:01.720]
Whatever you want and this and that and then we started trying to work with this stuff for a couple of days

[00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:05.880]
And all of us including me were in here like till 10 o'clock midnight every night

[00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:08.480]
Loading stuff because the way you know

[00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:11.060]
Roy Presman is the chief engineer is a real asshole

[00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:12.920]
No, he is

[00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:19.980]
And any he started telling us well, you know those parts you got 30 days to get rid of all the curts

[00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:22.440]
He started laying down all this crap and being like a dictator

[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:29.200]
Yeah, and in the meantime we got a whole room full of cards still stacked up the machining and all the work that we did on these mini-d's

[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:34.680]
You know these mini CDs we loaded all this stuff on mini CDs and what you know who is smoking?

[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:39.800]
Oh, yeah, you know who is smoking there. Yeah, so I come back from vacation. I get it. We get a memo wait to hear this

[00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:43.460]
I come back from nine great days in Rome the weather was great

[00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:48.340]
I had the time of my life. I felt great come in here the first day on Tuesday like two days ago

[00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:54.360]
There's a memo from our illustrious program director finally got off the floor a lot of to put out a memo and it says

[00:10:55.440 --> 00:11:01.900]
According to our chief engineer no smoking will be allowed in this building absolutely except for you know who

[00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:09.160]
Oh boy. Yeah, talk about a knife in my back. Okay, so today we all decided well you know who can be anybody

[00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:15.260]
So George's you know who and Wayne and Adam and suds everybody here is you know who and we're all smoking up a storm today

[00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:22.080]
It's a w. I. D. Smoking day. Well was you know who supposed supposed to be you. Yeah, it was you I assume yes

[00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:24.120]
I was thinking it might be Steve no

[00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:29.720]
I think he goes out and stands in the parking lot in between hanging out in the truck of his car for hours at a time

[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:33.900]
No smoking except for you know who so I'm gonna win a vacation of course

[00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:39.040]
They played a lot of best uptakes and I had they were old tapes and they had a bunch of GDs in there with my

[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:44.560]
bucket course body bought happy to be listening last Monday and it were like 75 GDs in the first hour

[00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:47.920]
And of course he was making a friday phone calls. What's going on with that GD place?

[00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:55.020]
They're not gonna stuff actually now the new deal is George has got to like spend 45 hours a day editing out GDs from the old best uptakes

[00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:58.840]
Oh boy. Yeah, you know what they have here the best of

[00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:00.700]
System that they have here at the CD

[00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:06.960]
These guys it's amazing the alarm watching them as I'm doing the show the horn off turns around and he edits

[00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:12.160]
This is the compact disc as we're doing the show because they do and they do best of overnight

[00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:16.820]
They do an hour of my show this kid's editing the thing as we go and it's ready to go at midnight

[00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:19.360]
It's just get the compact. Yes. We don't want to get carried away

[00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:21.620]
It's like it's it's incredible

[00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:25.960]
Some of the technology some of it is I don't want to push through all right too much, you know

[00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:30.620]
Really boy. Oh man. Oh man. This guy makes much ween seem like a good humor man

[00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:34.120]
This is the sourest the most arrogant though

[00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:37.700]
He thinks like all sheep engineers he thinks he runs the joint this guy's a maniac

[00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:41.060]
And I had a fight this guy to get to DCS in here

[00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:46.800]
We have practically world war three I'd have a bad of a big meeting with a big triumvirate from packs and the broadcast thing

[00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:52.000]
They get to DCS in there and he's a broken man now. So his new deal is he's gonna get that fast

[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.840]
He just stopped smoking and Arnomat or what I'd say that's the new deal

[00:12:55.480 --> 00:13:01.780]
Re time happy equipment don't work, but he's worried about who smoking or not. Oh boy. It's all believe it. It's incredible

[00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:06.180]
Is it better or worse so far? I would say on a scale zero. It's minus infinity

[00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:11.420]
I know they're pretty much leaving me alone, but but we got Ron and Ron in the morning

[00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:13.200]
We came in here one day a couple weeks ago

[00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:19.060]
To check the joint out and Ron Diaz this guy have you ever seen these guys? He's a big guy

[00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:24.080]
He's a big guy. I said that he's like he could be a tumestall he could be a

[00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:25.700]
He's like an Indian

[00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:28.260]
Because like our store Indian yeah

[00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:33.240]
He's like a totem pool this guy. I said they ought to stick about in front of some old bingo over here in Hollywood

[00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:39.700]
He just got he never cracks a smile and then the tool came in here the little guy Bennington has got not red locks

[00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:44.300]
He's got deadlocks. He's got drill locks that are so chmutzie and so full of crap that you know

[00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:48.500]
There's stuff crawling around of there the most bizarre looking guys. I mean they make us look good

[00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:53.180]
I've never seen anything like him and of course all they talk about is racist crap about the rights and same

[00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:57.740]
Pete which I have no idea what the people here care about they you know right so I come on at 10 o'clock

[00:13:57.740 --> 00:14:00.680]
And I feel like I'm coming from five years of dead air

[00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:07.460]
Then Rick and Sudden they have to do the course are we negotiating their deal and having very little success to that and

[00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:13.960]
Then deep will of course flew the coop and I heard it. I heard you and the dolphins of course all the sports are going over there for a

[00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:17.000]
gigantic ridiculous amount was two and it's gonna lose their ass but

[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:22.940]
And the reason we have we have no show we got we got a man did hang it on at night because still dolphins season over

[00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:28.940]
He'll be gone. Yeah, so at the end of the summer we have no programming from six p.m. The six a.m. What?

[00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:33.780]
What happened with the dolphins? I mean I thought that that was the whole corner start of the well

[00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:38.160]
I mean how they can put up like three seven million plus millions of for freebies all kinds of stuff

[00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:42.860]
And they just reached the point where was you know, it was gonna be a losing proposition. Oh get a lot of this

[00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:46.040]
There was a guy just that there's those sports radio in Los Angeles

[00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:52.580]
But there's one space out of San Diego called extra which has seven D7000 right right as the Mexican government is right right

[00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:54.480]
And they get into LA well

[00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:58.240]
We could go these guys down there who do the afternoon show did a

[00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:03.140]
Guess what I think dear doors interview no and it made the paper

[00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:08.280]
Three people call their show. I don't know whether they were calling for Miami or here or what and they call them

[00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:12.240]
Because so what is it like film Henry's been on the year six weeks and you're already copied as I call

[00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:16.980]
And the dude the host of the shows is oh no, no, we'll do what that the bill Henry guy does

[00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:21.740]
I was down in Miami two years ago for the Super Bowl. I heard that whole Brian Cox thing

[00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:26.640]
That's like and you know you know to be able to what I'm doing

[00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:33.600]
You guys are doing some phony dear door thing and and uh so dear door threat to sue and one thing about Los Angeles

[00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:38.680]
Where they threaten to see in Miami. Yeah, they will see here. Yeah, the most with the edges

[00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:42.180]
Well, I'm sending them all down here because if you are just having a suit cocks up there because

[00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:46.080]
Cox broadcasting I'm discovering. I don't want to mention any particular lawsuits

[00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:50.840]
But they're like paying off everybody. I mean all you got to do is to them and look at them ugly. They're okay. Here's some money

[00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:55.960]
You know what I you're right. We can't see anything specific. No, and I'm hearing stuff. Yeah

[00:15:56.460 --> 00:16:01.240]
It's weird and I talked to a norm about the thing and norms like ready to hang himself

[00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:05.940]
You know over that bill anyway. Yeah, I didn't think the norm was hung but

[00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:10.140]
But why no no interest you know while we're hanging in there. We're doing the best we can

[00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:14.340]
We have no idea what the trend was we have a program director who's walking around kind of in coherent

[00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:17.040]
Who does about sixteen different shifts a week now?

[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:21.220]
Seriously, we have no programming from eight o'clock at night. They play best Iran and Ron tapes

[00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:23.500]
Because they haven't figured out who to put on at night

[00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:26.800]
We got that Ron bar sports abortion overnight from the West Coast

[00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:30.440]
Which we got 75 different sports shows on as you know no audience

[00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:32.660]
And we got long as the news department

[00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:38.860]
What is doing the news in the morning and that's it right and then we got the traffic guys stumbles through the news at noon every day

[00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:43.860]
Which traffic that is our news department and suds does the news and afternoon drive

[00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:45.080]
Yeah

[00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:47.700]
Well, I just shouldn't laugh

[00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:54.680]
Really should laugh I'm gonna give you two chuckles anyway, but I when you come and go

[00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:58.320]
I'll tell you that when you come and rise now, but when you come and back

[00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:02.740]
Well, I don't know I I sure would like to plan a little pair of beings swing

[00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:08.500]
We'll put Rick and suds back in the morning put you back on an afternoon drive and see they they messed with a thing that was already

[00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:13.280]
There was no problem. You know I'm saying like radio people always do. Oh, and then we got to consult them by the way

[00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:15.060]
Oh, it ain't stable is yes

[00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:21.820]
Yeah, but I like you you like you. I well our show has been exempt from the new memos that have come out about how we have to have

[00:17:21.820 --> 00:17:28.220]
Shiny bright happy cars on the air and about how they have to screen the cars extensively and they have to like

[00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:31.700]
Coach the cars and what to say. I mean it is so on

[00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:35.780]
W. I. O. G. It's unbelievable. It's guys got no concept of what the stations all about

[00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:43.100]
See he runs this Kayla sex out here. Yeah, and there you wouldn't believe it the Kayla sex is the LA version or they're trying to do

[00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:50.240]
What we did in Miami. Yeah, yeah, God is a bad a body really bad and the Howard's on there right Howard's turn

[00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:55.580]
Howard's doing good in the morning the rest of the station got to want something. Yeah, they got like these three guys in the midday

[00:17:55.580 --> 00:18:02.140]
They call them the regular guys, you know like hey, I can relate then they got I don't know for sure

[00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:06.360]
The two-hour show between two and four and they have this Ricky Rackman kid. It was all right

[00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:11.140]
Love the name and then they got that cat for all y'all who you know is

[00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:15.900]
Yeah, if you ever as a palmo but he doesn't have a show because he's running. Yeah, yeah

[00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:20.760]
And I don't know what else they got some street kid on a 10 o'clock at night who comes on the kids from East LA and he goes

[00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:24.020]
Okay, the elections are over. I don't know you pissed off

[00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:27.680]
Very so

[00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:33.820]
They got four conversations here in the oil and its old just right. It's a pretty bad. I'll tell you one thing

[00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:38.240]
And since we've been over this new building the calls have really I'm telling you you never seen nothing like this

[00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:41.980]
Old like they're dropping off. They have dwindled down to a precious few

[00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:45.700]
I mean, I've been back third day from vacation. I'm already going on another vacation now

[00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:47.040]
It's unbelievable

[00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:52.400]
But we do have the billboards up. They look great, but this dude Sabo is is in your corner, right?

[00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:53.980]
Major asshole

[00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:59.480]
Major asshole. I mean this guy he has no clue what this market is all about

[00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:01.640]
He has no clue what our format is all about

[00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:07.580]
He's another one of these guys who thinks that you can take a formula and you can go from one market to another

[00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:11.720]
You know I'm saying but you know as well as I do that this is not like any other market

[00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:17.680]
I know it and he doesn't get it. Well the guy's from rock and roll and so he figures he's from hunger. That's a guy. Yeah, he's from hunger

[00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:23.400]
Wallace and I already went seven minutes past a break, but it's great here your voice as a talk to you and

[00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:29.260]
Well, I'm we'll pack your sandwiches. We'll make you a spread like it ever so I have a limousine waiting for you at the airport

[00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:44.420]

For a river. He's gonna be here for the king, Genie. Yeah. Yeah, you know

120 suits of the YG if you want to get over and get a great lunch or great dinner any day of the week seven days a week

[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:06.320]
Okay

[00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:15.900]
All right

[00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:30.380]
Holy cow

I'll tell you once more before I hang up the phone. Okay, check out

[00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:41.080]
Oh

My

[00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:02.840]
Tell you what's more before I hang up the phone

[00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:03.700]
I got you

[00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:08.240]
I got you

[00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:24.060]
I got you

[00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:24.060]

[00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:31.100]
You have sex with me

[00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:33.600]
You're right. I got you down

[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:37.560]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, holy cow

[00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:44.800]
I'll tell you once more before I hang up the phone

[00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:51.380]
Okay, you down. Oh god. What do you sell it at W. I. Damn emotionally spent after a hearing from Phil Henry

[00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:57.760]
Oh, here's guess what it's still didn't get on after waiting all that time. Hey, that is shame. I'm really excited for you

[00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:03.360]
Only in this town can we get Phil Henry on there and then follow it with that you know what I'm saying

[00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:08.340]
On the leaveable so typical that there are no words to describe it

[00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:16.300]
We have two open lines that he out of town lines one triple eight nine four nine W I O D one eight eight eight nine four nine

[00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:18.780]
Well, I guess a regular every day for a couple of hours

[00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:22.060]
Here's a lady in North Miami Beach. Hello

[00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:27.360]
Hello, yes, ma'am. I want to you to know. I'm gonna take up donations

[00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:30.560]
So that you and Phil and

[00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:36.080]
They're reconfudging. I'll get back on your own radio station and tell the rest of them what to do

[00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:37.900]
To blow it out there. That's right. Yeah

[00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:44.160]
I mean this station was very highly successful the only problem was that they weren't making as much money as they wanted

[00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:48.700]
And then all of a sudden in the last year that cox-ordered they started making a lot of money with it and

[00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:54.980]
And then this right gets a hold of the station for a song they practically give it as a holiday gift and they start tinkering with it

[00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:59.800]
Bringing them consultants and just the case and everybody out to door. I don't know what these people are thinking about

[00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:02.780]
They're not thinking they got themselves a ninja jack

[00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:08.680]
And they're basically a neat radio station and they're they're we're watching it to cigarette right in front of our push

[00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:14.840]
If they had a brain it'd be dangerous exactly now one thing I'm even without one they're pretty dangerous. Yes

[00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:18.840]
Oh, I might want to record your show. Why not?

[00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:23.360]
Good because my kid moved away and he is dying

[00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:30.020]
He has to have some tape as long as he don't do anything sinister with it. You can record it. Yeah. No, what he's doing

[00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:32.720]
He says if he plays it up there

[00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:38.120]
The guys he's working with will make donations and maybe you're getting invited to thevania. Yeah

[00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:38.940]
Uh-huh. Where?

[00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:40.560]
Come to where?

[00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:42.420]
Pennsylvania

[00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:48.200]
