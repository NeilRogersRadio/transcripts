[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.540]
I'm Jennifer Rem news talk and entertainment radio six ten so Jennifer Rick wants to apologize

[00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:10.940]
I just want to say one thing okay and that is take all the time you want the mark of a professional is not to make

[00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:16.860]
Excuses. I mean we're all human. We all make mistakes but the reality here is four minutes after 12

[00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:22.340]
He was supposed to be out of here at 10 o'clock this morning and he's using your show to make excuses

[00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.180]
For the deficiencies and hits and that's really all I have to say it's unprofessional

[00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.420]
It's weak and it's getting kind of boring

[00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.980]
Anybody have a hard or a liver? Yeah, and that's it

[00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.800]
That's it you want to respond to what Jennifer said

[00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.880]
Basically apparently she's criticizing the content of your show because you invited me in here

[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.760]
No, I'm criticizing you for spending the next two hours of your day

[00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.820]
Yeah, Nio said come on in sit down

[00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.860]
So you're criticizing me because I took him up on his invitation

[00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.180]
I think you're making excuses. I think you'd be better off getting in your car and going home

[00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.720]
Yeah, she's working on your show tomorrow morning. What I don't want to pull words in her mouth

[00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.760]
I don't think she's criticizing you for staying

[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.200]
I think she's criticizing you for staying for the purpose of

[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.300]
scapegoating the two two share in the morning. Yeah making excuses

[00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.660]
Rick in all sincerity your time would be better spent if you got in your car went home and

[00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.300]
Prepared for a real show tomorrow morning without

[00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:30.500]
Get baby without slamming the news department without slamming Steve nickel Bob Green Paxon or anybody else

[00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.380]
Just do your job and so basically Neil can do that, but I can't

[00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:40.420]
I'm saying you're wasting everybody's time and I've got to go back to the newsroom and prepare the one o'clock

[00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:41.560]
See a Jennifer

[00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:49.360]
See you have a wet spot in your chair right now. No, I don't unless you left it there because I

[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:56.740]
You didn't do it. No, I don't you were just chomping at the bit waiting for you her to finish the news so she could come back and we would have a

[00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:02.560]
I do that frequently with her at the end of the news just like I did with Jackie at the 10 o'clock news when I asked her if she

[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:09.120]
I felt that she was responsible for the demise of our morning show on this radio station superb conductor

[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:16.700]
Yeah, and you invited me in here, but yet she criticized me. What if I had said no Neil? I'm not gonna come in here

[00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:18.500]
What about it?

[00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.640]
So then you wouldn't have come in here

[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.060]
Why would I turn down the invitation you said would you please come in and sit down? I didn't say please at all

[00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:31.180]
I never said the audience. I owed you time. Sit down. Sit your ass down and let's air the sound right

[00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.220]
And you gave a rather descriptive because you stood there in the doorway as usual and went through this

[00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.560]
hysterical routine about the people sliding doors and having fits in the news room

[00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.100]
And they were all bent out of shape into place coming unglued as well as you know me

[00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:51.420]
I have never been hysterical about anything well as close to it but not hysterical in tone, but just hysterical in

[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.840]
mindset

[00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:55.680]
Yes, hey

[00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:02.280]
It was a hysterical confrontation, but you said you always be Mr. was what you said you owe me mister

[00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.160]
Yeah, I said okay, I'll sit down and then I said I'll be here an hour

[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.280]
Every night North Miami. Hello. Yes. How you doing? You'll listen to chronic. Yes, it is

[00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.520]
I just wanted to let Rick know that I will not be listening from two to six

[00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:23.900]
Unfortunately, I don't think a show is very interesting. Yeah, and mr. Echo the other guy suds is just echoing these little jokes

[00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.180]
You can hardly hear so you don't like their show is what you're saying don't like their show

[00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.260]
Let me ask you this yes if we could get Chuck Meyerback

[00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:38.160]
If that's not gonna help if we could have Chuck doing the news and bonding and interacting with Rick and suds in the afternoon

[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.960]
Would that sway you in any way? No, I wouldn't sway me at all. I'll make a note to miss you sir

[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.060]
Well, hey, I'm sorry. Yeah, nothing personal. I don't know you personally

[00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.140]
But as as you're as a as a show it is boring. You don't talk about anything

[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:56.520]
Once I listen to you once and you were you were taking a consensus of McDonald's delivers and you spend 20 minutes

[00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.980]
Trying to find out if for any McDonald's and Miami delivers to your home. I mean that's got to be the most boring thing next to sports

[00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.900]
I mean who the next next next to sports the sports. Yeah

[00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.660]
I'm sorry, you know, I love your show, but when you talk about hockey, I don't listen. Okay

[00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:12.980]
Well, that's good. We got rid of him right

[00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.100]
Hey world cup tonight game number two eight o'clock in Montreal

[00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.120]
I'm gonna play hockey highlights for four hours. It's the smartest to piss him off

[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.080]
He's a chronic but at least he admitted it in the beginning who cares about him

[00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:26.660]
You don't care about it at all. I don't

[00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.220]
Here's the lady in my in other words. He's hard to please. He like he likes me

[00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.280]
But he doesn't listen when I talk about hockey or sports, which is a great deal of what I talk about

[00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:40.140]
So he doesn't listen very much and he hates you guys, but felt compelled to call and be heard right

[00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:44.100]
An accurate snout. I should have asked him if he likes Phil. I'm sure he likes Phil

[00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:49.220]
Okay, so Mark Hopkins in the other room with dark glasses on waiting to participate in the blood bath

[00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.540]
He would like to throw in a couple of cents worth

[00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:56.000]
No, it's seriously. We're gonna invite everybody in the building to come in today and trash somebody

[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.560]
We don't care who you trash who you rip what kind of cost of comments you have

[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:00.340]
Which is one of the great

[00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:05.340]
Fatick is an asshole is what he said which I find very

[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.100]
In temperate remark Greg and I have always gotten along fairly well

[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.080]
And he does covet that studio their next door and he does

[00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:17.020]
He does play bush boss from time to time, but asshole

[00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:21.860]
I think might be stretching it just a little bit as in breakfast. Here's a mobile and candle. Hello

[00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:23.200]
Now yes, sir

[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:25.360]
About what

[00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.840]
About

[00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:31.460]
Yeah, but your phone is like it sounds like Woody Woodpecker's got his thing in it. He does

[00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:37.600]
Listen early in the morning. It sounds like he's got his wood in it. Yeah, at six o'clock in the morning

[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:44.020]
When you're getting up and you're ready to go to work and everything you you don't want to hear somebody whining and moaning and grown

[00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:46.180]
And like really does all the time

[00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:49.380]
Then why are you listening every morning to know that I do that at six a.m

[00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:51.920]
I turned you off and I listen to my cranberry

[00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:52.800]
Yeah

[00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:57.040]
Then how do you know I do it every morning you're wrong. I don't do that every morning

[00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:00.020]
Well every time I listen to you it seems like you're

[00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:02.460]
Apparently they you're picking along you're picking around days I guess

[00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:06.020]
Or something your kids or your wife or your

[00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:08.240]
Yeah, that's right. Why?

[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.640]
And that's that doesn't

[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.820]
How come you can't be more like me and never hear me belly ache intervention about anything

[00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:20.220]
Well, I mean first thing in the morning, you know you you're ready to get called what would you like us to talk about sir

[00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:22.560]
We'll start tomorrow. Oh, sometimes you're hysterical

[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:30.300]
You're funny yourself, but yeah, what was that so okay? Well, let me just make a note no wives no kids in that last guy no McDonald

[00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:33.020]
No, let me ask you something. What about Chuck?

[00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:37.440]
Sir everybody's got all their own problems nobody wants to hear you talk about yours

[00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:44.580]
Okay, listen to me. Are you pleased thank you Leah would you please listen to me sir if we had Chuck Meyer if we brought Chuck in tomorrow on a freight train

[00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:47.200]
I don't even know who Chuck's Myers is what I want to hear him

[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:51.460]
Okay, see I think you're embarking up the wrong tree. Yeah, okay. Thanks pal

[00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:53.080]
Thanks for the high marks

[00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:57.820]
I think you're embarking up the wrong tree. I don't think Chuck Meyer is the answer to your career the so

[00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:03.740]
But he said you I don't think that's a truck. I mean I like Chuck. He's a great news guy like I said how about best in the market

[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:10.920]
I already I already went through that again. You want me to continue with the peeing all over his leg and we'll have a flood in here pretty soon

[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:18.720]
But the fact is that having a great news guy is not relevant to whether or not people are gonna want to do you think people listen to Howard because they like the news on his show

[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:24.660]
You know, it's a majority of his show from what I've heard robin is always doing the news and he is always commenting

[00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:27.200]
Would you say that robin is a great news person?

[00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:31.520]
No, yeah, and who used to do the news on my show on Zeta

[00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:34.280]
I thought he was great the bird right

[00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:42.580]
Yeah, I knew but do you think he's a great news? It was news. It was news like I'd never heard before. Yeah, that's what we're all looking for oh

[00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:45.500]
Oh, there's a different news like that

[00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:46.940]
Yeah

[00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:53.320]
But I don't know why he's bringing up Chuck does the news like the bird I don't know what no

[00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:58.200]
Did Chuck didn't do the news like the bird you just got your saying yeah? I said it was innovative

[00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:01.300]
You said does Chuck do news like that that's innovative. I said yeah

[00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:04.720]
Chuck do you do the news like the bird?

[00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:11.900]
Chuck Chuck Chuck he'll queue up in a minute. Oh, yeah, he does the news like the bird

[00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:14.140]
He does

[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.960]
So anyway, welcome to blood bath part one which I think this isn't the end

[00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:23.980]
This is like Chicago said only the beginning. I don't you know, I don't it's not gonna be productive

[00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:30.340]
It's not useful, but it sure kills some good time and the stimuli. It's a lot of calls and probably get a lot of people talking about this damn radio station again

[00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:33.840]
Which is I think gotta be productive even if they're ripping us an ass

[00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:39.500]
Let's let's I'm a serious let's start our own damn self promotion here for the next 18 days or whatever it is

[00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:45.040]
Because we know we're sure not gonna get any from Cox or the smart key out front still says coast your way through the workday

[00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:47.240]
97.3 coast this

[00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:55.040]
You notice that no talk about bush league and unprofessional. Do you know that from the day this station was sold

[00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:01.160]
There has never been one mention on that marquee of anything related to the AM

[00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:06.560]
I'm very aware and including the dolphins which always were no matter what else was going on in the world

[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:11.540]
When there was a dolphin game broadcast on here with our 70 hour free game show it was all not that the marquee

[00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:15.800]
I mean, I'll nothing but geeks drive on this road anyway, but it's just it's just a

[00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:24.200]
Symptomatic of the whole attitude that they've got is that the marquee says nothing about the AM and never will till they get we get away from them

[00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:30.480]
Right spite right how many years ago did I tell you that the operative word here was spite

[00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.620]
71214 at radio spite

[00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:37.760]
W. What?

[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:39.720]
Spite

[00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:53.180]
Once you go pro's act you'll never go back rickinson six to 10 a.m. on news talk at entertainment radio

[00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:56.760]
610 WIOD that is another lie okay

[00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:02.320]
No, you know it you know that's a lie

[00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:07.280]
What when one was doing the news in the morning when he was filling in which I think he's a fine news

[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:09.820]
No, you don't

[00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:10.860]
One

[00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:19.500]
A little flat and a little deadpan so in other words you're not you're not interested in having a good news guy

[00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:24.800]
Come on Phil and having a good new go. Oh, she's that's so much is great. Yeah

[00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:29.140]
Let's have Phil come in here and be the arbiter of this this is great

[00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:32.920]
Great

[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:38.720]
So who do you want to rip me say I yeah and do it in your own voice when I said yeah

[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:43.340]
That's a good guy really made me angry. I didn't hear it. I didn't hear it. Yeah, I know

[00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:48.980]
I know it's taking shots at us. He was taking shots and you did not defend us my friend Phil Hendry

[00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:51.360]
Yeah, part of rain shut down. Yeah, exactly

[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:54.200]
But I remember asking Bob because you would said to me

[00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:57.040]
I guess it was about a year ago you said you know we had very big numbers in the afternoon

[00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:00.280]
Yeah, you said you had sixes no you they never had sixes

[00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:03.000]
What are you talking about are you are you in that

[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.460]
I read your part in 2554 you had sixes

[00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:07.720]
Absolutely sir

[00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:14.100]
In 12 plus we had a five knives. Okay. I asked Bob he said that you were a liar

[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:20.380]
About that about what that you never have Bob Green Bob a Lou yeah, Bob a Lou

[00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:25.060]
Let's go pull up the old books. It's easy to find Barbara green easy to find

[00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:31.180]
Buckburg green Barbara green said that but yeah, yeah, yeah, how you doing? She's great. She's looking good

[00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:34.600]
She uh she told me that you guys never had those kinds of numbers

[00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:39.100]
It's easy to verify. Huh? It's easy to verify whether we do it. I don't think you did either

[00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:42.040]
But you made I think you're like embellishing a little in other words

[00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:46.000]
But I first you start with a four and then it becomes a five and it's the the passage of time

[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:54.540]
You know it becomes a six let me tell you something. I had a bonus of $10,000 if I got a 5.1. Yeah, I got a 5.12 plus

[00:11:54.540 --> 00:12:00.860]
Yeah, I got a 5.0. They didn't give it to us. Yeah, okay. I've had that too. I missed by a tenth of a point

[00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:06.040]
They don't give it to you. We hit 12 plus numbers of 5.0. Yeah, we had 2554

[00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:10.420]
What did I have in the sixes? I don't know this right after Alex Bennett left

[00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:14.840]
This is like this is our first deal before we were actually even under contract. That was our first book out of the hole

[00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:23.440]
Second, excuse me second book out of the hole. Yeah after Alex Bennett in a dump in in in in 12 plus 12 plus in 2554 numbers were higher than that

[00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:31.460]
Now and and I think you brought that up to take a shot at me. No, I did not I think that you were hurt by it's what

[00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:36.260]
Well Rick has said very often that his numbers in the afternoon were better than yours. I know you have one great book

[00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:41.700]
I had one book in the winter of 95 and that was it and that we still just you know is a great talent without a book

[00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:45.780]
No, that's the truth. I mean that's not it though in my target demo

[00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:49.180]
I always I hit number one six out eight books in our target

[00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:53.320]
Yeah target demo, which is like men which you know goes to show you smarter than I am

[00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:57.800]
Well, I mean that just that was a part if I want to head the bonus based on men

[00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:00.500]
I'd have had my bonus every book since I've been here for eight years

[00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:05.620]
But being a schmuck and being easily influenced and easily caught. Oh, you don't need an agent. You know, we'll take a yeah

[00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:10.840]
We want screw you did the guy ever calling him by the way that no that's guy contract tampering did

[00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:15.140]
When's he caught? I don't know but he spoke of you highly. Yeah

[00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:17.160]
John Buckwell spoke of you

[00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:19.780]
I like our fuck well speaks highly of you and

[00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:24.060]
And Mitch Dolan the general manager wabc and Johnny Dolan

[00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:30.260]
Down there in the urinal so I think Johnny's on the line right now with a crank call what had been in to say is today that upset you

[00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:36.560]
It didn't upset me it upset Adam. I did not hear it. What had been in to say oh that crap about that

[00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:39.400]
He was on while you weren't afternoon there would have been more crossover

[00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:43.920]
Well, there would have been more cycling learning audience to afternoon. Yeah, I didn't hear that

[00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:53.240]
Yeah, I didn't hear that part about how the morning the morning audience oftentimes turns their radio off part when Margaret was on a few days ago

[00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:57.380]
Rip in me for too much for the hockey hockey hockey or whatever. She was ripping it about how I was a jealous

[00:13:57.380 --> 00:14:01.440]
Oh, she doesn't like us either she hates me because I'm glad to see the fact that fills go to LA

[00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:05.720]
She's not staying is she cuz I'll be glad to see her girl. Yeah, okay. She's gone

[00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:10.440]
Then you know something I am jealous of the fact that he's going to LA not but I wouldn't want to work for this company there

[00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:11.900]
Right you'd want to work on Los Angeles

[00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:17.320]
What have I told you you told me you hated Los Angeles. I do why would you want to work there?

[00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:19.980]
Well, I mean, there's only he said here there. Yeah, exactly

[00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:22.640]
There's there's a better play of

[00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:26.360]
That room where you can hide there you have to live like in Watts

[00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:32.240]
Right you don't have to Hollywood hills and look to see if you can see the sign every day and find your way home

[00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:36.980]
I have conveyed the same sentiment have it. Yeah, that's right. Well, you know, we're can we do a break?

[00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:39.860]
I wanted to ask you question. Well, I don't want to have time to ask

[00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:47.720]
Why have I never want to try why haven't I never gone gone beyond why have you never broken out of Miami and done what you should do and that is

[00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:54.080]
Go to a one of the top five markets. Are you again trying to lure me to break my contract with the Paxon people?

[00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:55.720]
I think I think

[00:14:55.720 --> 00:15:00.720]
And I say this about Rick and suds too. I think that you're you're deserving so in other words

[00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:06.540]
As you leave what you would like to see is a total disintegration of W. I. D. with that with that make you feel better in other words

[00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:12.000]
Then then you can tell your then you can tell your grandchildren say you know when I left that place it went in a crapper man

[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.340]
It's just completely disintegrated. Let me ask you something do you have a part of the break?

[00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:19.260]
Please I think I can because it's 1222 and W I O D

[00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:22.300]
Use talking entertainment radio

[00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:23.360]
610

[00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:24.360]
W I

[00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:25.580]
O D

[00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:26.880]
Okay, 1225

[00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:33.520]
Thanks Chuck. So let me ask you a question. Do you think that Chuck Myers the answer to the Rick and suds?

[00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:34.840]
Jesus

[00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:37.540]
Rick and suds you're starring Chuck Myers. Right.

[00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:43.640]
Sure. He's trying to Chuck. Yeah, we used to feature Chuck a lot. It's like your show of show is featuring Sid Caesar

[00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:46.080]
It's tough to prep a morning show, isn't it?

[00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:52.160]
I mean seriously because you get up and would you please get on mic please right here. There you go

[00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:57.980]
Yeah, tough to prep a morning show. Yeah, but that's a question. I always wanted to ask you and why you wouldn't bust out

[00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:02.220]
Oh, that's right. We were back at market envy because I made a lot of good career decisions

[00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:08.180]
Well, actually when I was still doing regular talk when I went to Nashville when I left the WNWS

[00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:12.240]
And I went to Nashville LA see and I was a disaster for a month with those pickers

[00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:19.020]
I thought god I get a guy out of here and I had a deal with WWW DB and Philly Philly right and I was going to work for them

[00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:21.300]
Jerry Williams was there and Irv Homer and those guys

[00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:27.980]
And the day that I was supposed to leave I went in and say goodbye to the Casper and he sweet talked me and to come back down here to WS news

[00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:30.980]
So my furniture all went up to Philly

[00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:34.740]
And I came back down here and I had to wait like a week to get my furniture back

[00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:41.000]
But that's and I've had all kinds of chances, you know the ABC people were enchanted with me and the guys who like

[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:46.960]
There's Walt Sabo that got a lot of trouble. Well, Sabo hired us for waxing. Did he? Yeah, well he's

[00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:50.780]
Consulting Kaley's while he's the one who put the guys on a KFI in the afternoon

[00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:55.760]
And it was supposed to be like Rick and Sun. That's a saboteur for the John and the John and John can yeah

[00:16:56.440 --> 00:17:01.200]
Which means nothing to this audience so we got to get back to why would you want to go somewhere and start nothing to this line

[00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:04.700]
Why do somebody want to leave it? I'll give you an example Jerry Williams in Boston

[00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:11.020]
How long has he been there 30 years for maybe I heard him in 75 when I was in I've been there at least 35 years

[00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:17.060]
Okay came down here to WNWS for a year out of Boston right hated it

[00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:21.220]
I mean he had we had a gigantic book. We had humongous numbers. I think he had a six four

[00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:24.100]
I was on a night. I had an 11 something and

[00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:29.980]
Alice Rantel had a fiber we had enormous numbers. They were all old of course because of the you know kind of talk

[00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:35.140]
But he hated it here and got mugged on the air the last night before he left

[00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:39.280]
I was on the air he came in to say goodbye and then he walked out into the hallway

[00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:42.060]
There were two black guys out there who would who mugged him

[00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:45.000]
And they're running around the building and he comes in

[00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:51.700]
Clutching his neck and they've yanked off the chain off his neck and his watch and I don't know what he's talking about

[00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:57.520]
I had to give out the somebody please call 911 on the air on the years you never heard that was in the radio station

[00:17:57.520 --> 00:17:59.020]
Yes, he got mugged in the station

[00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:03.740]
And it was like this it was like a room the studio was a room where there's only one way out

[00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:08.060]
There's no windows no place to go and thank God that they never a great idea and somebody yelled out

[00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:13.080]
Hey, it's a radio station and which they had no idea what the building was because it looked like an office building

[00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:17.720]
You know little uh whatever and so when they found out that we were on the air they panicked and they ran out

[00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:21.280]
And that was the last night he was he came in to say goodbye on the air

[00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:26.180]
Got mugged in the back to Boston and he's he's still on our keon

[00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:29.760]
I'm assuming he's still doing great there so that so the the answer is that uh

[00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:35.800]
Sticking around in a market for many many years if you're if you're doing well

[00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:39.460]
Yeah, and you can develop it on that it doesn't go away. I can answer for that

[00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:42.240]
He's got a mind like a steel trap for a memory

[00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:44.640]
He remembers people weren't even born

[00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:48.140]
So you know what that makes you

[00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:54.720]
My heart locale indigenous you know everything about everything about here. Yeah, you've been there for some years

[00:18:55.180 --> 00:19:01.180]
But you you bring up people and history that that you know somebody always can identify with because you

[00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:05.080]
Been through it all so what is that for the merit? Nobody. Nobody cares about my amie

[00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:10.140]
Do you think our audience cares about nothing nothing can say redneck nothing can suffice for time

[00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:11.980]
And if you went out to Los Angeles or New York

[00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:15.920]
You wouldn't be as adapted as you are to hear to knowing everything. I'd be gigantic in LA

[00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:19.760]
I'd be I'd have 15 shares, but you wouldn't know what you're talking about for a long time Boston

[00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:22.320]
I'd have a 30 share do you know how weak the radio is up there?

[00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:28.940]
I got front hawk stations up there too. I terrible awful. Yeah weak then why don't you go because you hated here

[00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:34.020]
You love Boston. I would think that would be the reason is because you know everything now's the time

[00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:36.100]
Yeah, now's the time to break out

[00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:39.520]
This mantle this whole

[00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:45.740]
How much how much did the guy in New York the Bob of Green how much did the Beverly Green pay to come in here and try to uh

[00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:50.700]
I just walked in because I was enjoying it. I walked in see 58 guys standing in the control room the whole radio

[00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:57.180]
So yeah stop doing business listening to this. Yeah, and I had to just this is just a preview of things to come

[00:19:57.180 --> 00:20:00.220]
And the best of is after we find out for sure you that you're out of town

[00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:04.720]
Yeah, I train his love the track. I know and then then you'll really open it up in my back. I know that

[00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:05.960]
No, it's gonna happen

[00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:11.700]
You're not turned out the air conditioner after Jennifer got finished with me. Yeah, she got man

[00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:16.200]
No, we just don't say the same thing. I used to be great. We'll say that after you've gone and he used to be great

[00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:20.180]
Yeah, you were never got the numbers of Rick and suds did but hey you know not everybody care

[00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:24.880]
Well, let me ask you this okay. This is a good opportunity. Okay. You've heard a lot of his show in the afternoon

[00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:28.960]
Not recently because he's his mind is blown yeah, but like during the first two years

[00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:34.240]
Well, no, you know that that's true. I wouldn't say that. I say that. I'm trying. I'm you're trying

[00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:40.500]
This is this is a this is a summer and this is a season that is a difficult yeah, I'm to work everybody knows right

[00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:47.700]
So I'm doing different. I'm talking about the Halcyon days of your show the first two years when we were all pinging our pants and

[00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:50.940]
Ella would race down to the car to get in the car just so I wouldn't miss a minute

[00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:53.160]
Now would you say that your show?

[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.600]
Rick in the afternoon forget about the numbers

[00:20:56.600 --> 00:21:00.200]
Was better than the show that Phil has been doing an afternoon

[00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:06.180]
No, you can't say that you can't see what do we do exactly

[00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:09.460]
We do it. What are you doing? It's totally different radio show

[00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:13.960]
How do you make a subjective judgment? You the only thing you can do is judge it objectively

[00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:18.440]
If I brought you in a slice of pepperoni pizza right and a piece of dog crap

[00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:23.380]
Okay, and I said taste both of these even though they're entirely different

[00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:30.840]
Okay, and I said which one tastes better you probably would say the pepperoni pizza even though I was used to do a matter of opinion

[00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:35.780]
If I would like to find people that would say Phil is much more hilarious than you guys will ever be

[00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:38.260]
And I could find a call to this morning

[00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:42.560]
Said Phil is the greatest house ever been on a radio station and I'm he hates you and I'm just

[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:47.900]
Accepted I could find it was great. We could find our people that love each one of us and hate everybody else

[00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:54.320]
So what I'm saying is the only way you can you can gauge it is objectively and that is if you had bigger numbers in me in the afternoons

[00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:58.840]
It's quite possible that you belong at different time different time different

[00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:03.700]
What are we talking the game? No, let me tell you something. I think you would be great for more three years ago

[00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:07.300]
I would think you would be great. No, I would be good for mornings at all. I did mornings for many years

[00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:10.720]
I I can't do it better than us. I can't I can't do mornings better than us

[00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:12.860]
Let me tell you why get up in the morning and I can't

[00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:17.340]
All of us go three o'clock in the morning you like like Neil Neil features Neil

[00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:21.420]
Okay, Neil doesn't need any callers. He can go on. He's very interesting. Oh, thank you

[00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:22.480]
Yeah, you don't callers

[00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:27.300]
There you go. Like not prevent it and just be quiet. Okay, listen following you. It's a good thing. I don't

[00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:28.400]
Phil

[00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:34.160]
Phil can get by without any callers because you can you know you feature you whatever your talent is

[00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:41.400]
That is featured whether it's being whoever you want to be whether whatever it's you I feature the callers

[00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:45.340]
I feature the people I give them a forum just a minute

[00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:50.500]
You sit in here with suds you're the of the three of us the only one other than Phil's characters

[00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:55.720]
You're the only one and has a sidekick right suds and if we don't get any calls

[00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:59.520]
We're dead suds and I you don't need calls you got some

[00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:04.740]
Quizzling sitting in here that you can play off of all morning long doesn't mean it's necessarily entertaining

[00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:13.440]
Well, that's true. I don't want to be the one to say what I am saying is we feature the audience in the audience if you give them and what about Chuck the right

[00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:17.120]
Curum we used to feature Chuck y'all so the

[00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:22.340]
It took two and a half hours and we figured out the audience has replaced Chuck

[00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:28.460]
Which I know he's a big guy but it's just always been our show we could probably like you know the audience

[00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:35.500]
The people the seats of my audience people look forward to Ted people look forward to you know whoever the audience has always been our show

[00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:38.840]
Yeah, we have a knack of allowing them to do what's the one we just

[00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:43.220]
But we just automated Phil that we do that. He'll hands up on him

[00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:47.600]
Hang's up on who if they get going Phil said yeah, that's fine and hangs up on him

[00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:50.880]
If they get going with me, I say okay go what what do you got going?

[00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:53.920]
What you're saying is you treat the colors better than Phil does

[00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:56.740]
Differently see look at this you well

[00:23:56.740 --> 00:24:02.480]
But you just said you hang you exploit them and get something out of them like for example when Woody called yesterday morning

[00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:09.120]
I said oh my it's Woody just sat there like because he's going after you he was going after you and I did the same thing

[00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:12.840]
You're doing to me right now letting people go after somebody else to it

[00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:16.200]
But I'm exactly and I want it. No, you're letting other people doing your sit back

[00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:20.380]
You got a full board of colors you love it, but if you're right what he called right now and said anything

[00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:26.400]
He'd be gone in two seconds. Well, that's your thing see. I think that Gilbert is you keep stressing Chuck Meyer

[00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:29.640]
I think they Gilbert is somebody ought to be thinking about as part of that to two

[00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:33.760]
Okay, he is dangerous that guy. He is dangerous right. He's a ratings killer

[00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:35.420]
He's a cost. He'll remember

[00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:40.580]
You know, who is the first person after I finally dumped Gilbert after we you know

[00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:43.200]
We had exploited him for the two minutes worth of entertainment

[00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:47.320]
And abused him as much who is the next person that decided to pick up on Gilbert

[00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:51.640]
Come on me no before you I

[00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:58.320]
Don't recall Alex Bennett. No, yes. I didn't listen now. Alex. I couldn't he did hurt anybody else

[00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:03.960]
And that was one of his first mistakes besides setting foot in this town. I was nowhere was using Gilbert

[00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:08.020]
I was nowhere and doing the whole thing with a speed and with the government people love Gilbert

[00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:09.780]
I find him a sterical

[00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:11.100]
Managed

[00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:13.700]
Not on his own managed

[00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:18.240]
So are you saying that Gilbert is going to be part of the afternoon show featuring Gilbert? You know everything

[00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:23.020]
I say he says sorry. No, no, I'm trying to clarify. I'm not going to take anything for granted

[00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:27.780]
I'm trying to find out if you are going to ever wise up or you're going to continue using Gilbert as a crutch

[00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:31.660]
Yeah, exactly. He is not a crutch

[00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:37.240]
Yeah, as long as it's entertaining whatever it is it will be featured on the afternoon show as soon as it

[00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:39.600]
Ceases to become entertaining in my opinion it will be gone

[00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:45.460]
So in other words, you're saying Gilbert is going to be on the show as long as anything that on is

[00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:48.840]
Yeah, we'll be on when it's easy to be entertaining

[00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:55.940]
It will be off. Yeah, you you uh you you said to me many times that suds can't stand getting up that early right you don't like

[00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:59.480]
He hates it right. Yeah, right. He's just doing anything

[00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:03.840]
If it's not in front of it, you guys if you guys were knocking a ball out of the park there in afternoons

[00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:07.420]
And that's the place for you to be and one of the things is about you

[00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:10.700]
Well, yeah, it is

[00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:13.600]
See he's still doing it even though he's doing it in his voice

[00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:18.260]
He's taking a brutal shot at you and he doesn't want to uh he doesn't want to couch know to show it is

[00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:23.820]
Why don't know why it's a brutal shot? I mean you would say that you have a two two why film you would say that you had a feeling

[00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:28.260]
Rating I'm not saying a feeling show me really arbitrary this okay in other words

[00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:33.260]
We're gonna decide because they had better numbers in the afternoon that I you have had overall

[00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:36.300]
Okay, yeah, which is the better show okay?

[00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:38.960]
And I would be I mean to say that

[00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:42.380]
That's like saying you're gonna have to have an orange better

[00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:46.800]
I just got through Tony with the example of the pepperoni pizza and the dog turn that's right

[00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:50.720]
And he the station did have better numbers. Well then you'd have to say that they're right you did a big one

[00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:55.840]
No station had better numbers right the station overall had right exactly so everything is the letter alive

[00:26:55.840 --> 00:27:01.660]
I was doing that like I was like driving so everything is my cranberry would cycle over into rickens suds

[00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:04.000]
Well, not only that rickens suds were following me

[00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:09.540]
Now let me ask you were my number is bigger than yours or yes, yes bigger so however

[00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:16.060]
Wait a second. I want an accurate answer clock. You were inheriting a gigantic audience right the number one audience in the market we kept them

[00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:24.100]
You kept all of them hum wise afternoon drive time time spent listening which you know as a combination of both is much less than the afternoon

[00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:27.480]
Yeah, and there's nothing you'll ever do to combat that mm-hmm. I mean

[00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:33.340]
Less than what does fill it doesn't mean days it mid days they partner. He's got a huge kneels

[00:27:33.340 --> 00:27:39.760]
Like an eight hour or ten I've seen it like ten and nine hour to yourself and that's unheard of but that's you

[00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:45.380]
You can have that in the days people are one I was on mornings in Zeta you didn't have that not nine or ten the pretty damn

[00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:49.700]
Well, but you didn't have nine or ten and that's not because they like to show is just because of the

[00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:55.960]
But it was a byproduct of the we need to have five time spent listening in the afternoon five hours, which is pretty damn good. Yeah

[00:27:56.860 --> 00:28:01.300]
But it's not quite about which afternoon show was better was it more enjoyable?

[00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:01.660]
I say

[00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:05.980]
Concerts because if you had more success there

[00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:12.580]
Then you obviously, you know if you had a bigger audience there than obviously it's more successful show plus frankly

[00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:15.760]
I think that you do better with your advertisers than I do

[00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:20.020]
I think I've got a credibility problem with my characters where advertisers have freaked out that nobody's gonna

[00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:25.500]
Believe what I'm saying when it comes to a live spot, you know, okay, but the and also

[00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:27.900]
the thing in the and I

[00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:37.060]
Certainly and and I've listened to you know, I've listened to you you go out you schmooze clients better than I do all of this is new to me when I

[00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:41.260]
When I came to WI never ever had to do with me never had never had to tolerate

[00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:44.900]
I never had to talk to a salesperson before I get here. Yeah, which was a shock

[00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:50.380]
Okay, let me give you a little something in reverse. All right, so since we have been on afternoons

[00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:54.380]
There was a census that came in that changed the entire rating system

[00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:58.220]
And the numbers for the station have gone down because the Hispanic numbers when they took the

[00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:03.920]
Trend Phil went through the roof and last trendy went up to a floor. I had about a five five in there and

[00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:06.720]
We had a good trend. I think we had a good month, but I'm sorry

[00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:11.240]
We're talking about in the 90s when we used to be on afternoons and it was a different census

[00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:13.260]
Which the numbers is the numbers?

[00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:18.480]
You still the early night take a long nap and miss a decade the early 90s. I'm sorry

[00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:22.700]
I met the 1990 census and when a gear 90s. No, we all did

[00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:28.800]
Our numbers changed and I think went down with the census. Well, I hope Jennifer's listening to this because man

[00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:31.560]
What I'm trying to pay him a compliment

[00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:38.480]
It's what but then what you're saying is is that I think the number three we had bigger numbers in afternoon drive is really an

[00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:45.680]
Inoperative statement because there's a whole lot of okay, so now I thought now all of you do now that we're operating within the same time frame

[00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:51.240]
Right, it'll be interesting to see in the next year or two absolutely will compare every time a trend comes out

[00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:52.500]
I'll say well Phil had a four

[00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:58.840]
No, well, I don't know if Rick and suds are starting off with a two one in the afternoon Phil had a four

[00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:01.820]
He left him a four or whatever will be the last day will be all right

[00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:06.120]
And you're do you think that's fair because it's the same it's we're in the again 90s now right

[00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:07.960]
Okay, sure absolutely okay

[00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:13.140]
1240 at W.I.O.D. It's the end of the summer if you've been waiting for the best time of the year to buy a new Toyota your weight is over

[00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:16.140]
By the way Eli came to me in the hall this morning and he said

[00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:18.900]
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba in a copy and ba ba ba I said

[00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:24.260]
Eli no matter what the story is with a copy no matter what the agency tells you no matter what mark Jacobson says

[00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:26.520]
You're still an asshole and he said okay

[00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:29.480]
I'm finding what a what a

[00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:30.420]
You're

[00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:39.820]
Wow, okay 1242 at W.I.O.D. Welcome to our blood bath. So what is the facts have to say is an acoustic facts?

[00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:43.700]
It's this is from South you know him no, but I know the handwriting

[00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:49.400]
Rick why don't you admit that you're just bad and boring the two of you

[00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:52.720]
There's nothing interesting to cheese man

[00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:57.180]
I'll always be really old. I can't read it. I can read it and then they don't know it's a little bit

[00:30:57.180 --> 00:31:01.260]
There's nothing interesting to listen to on your show sign south. Yeah, okay

[00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:03.900]
So he likes you. Yeah

[00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:10.080]
So there's the deal in that when the trends come out every month. I'm gonna put like I'll take Phil's last number

[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:19.140]
Now how's this going to work by the way? Well, you got a compare book to you know annually to annually

[00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:22.640]
So you think it's time for me to get out huh? Is that what you're saying?

[00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:28.620]
Frankly, I think and I think the audience would agree if they were if they were gonna be honest

[00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:35.360]
Yeah, and I think the audience would like me to get out is that no I think the audience knows that you guys are better

[00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:38.260]
Uh, then Miami. That's what sells it

[00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:44.700]
Yeah, well, Sal realizes that you're well. He's saying your show is bad. Let me see that. Let me see that close

[00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:45.880]
for Miami

[00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:53.680]
No, no, no, there is no Sal. Okay. This is this is the same handwriting and see you dignified this if you would have showed it up to me close

[00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:59.900]
For like years. It's the same handwriting with a variety of names and just and it's always negative and how come you're a ripping Q

[00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:04.840]
I am and nobody else does that in your gel. It's just it's garbage. I don't even read it. Okay, but anyway

[00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:08.240]
Yeah, I think that a lot of people might ask you to ask the question

[00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:13.080]
You know, why are you not in a bigger market and that's and that's my question because I've been lazy because it's been

[00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:17.260]
No, no seriously. It's very I don't do any show prep. I don't like in the old days

[00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:19.580]
I used to do all that reading and research and guessing

[00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:23.240]
I just wander in here and I have a couple of things written down and that's all I do and

[00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:26.240]
It's it's lazy in terms of how you approach your show

[00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:30.320]
But you mean in terms of how you approach your career the same way. Yes, so you're not a good idea

[00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:33.740]
It's too much work. It's lost when they talked me out of having an agent. They figured at that point

[00:32:33.740 --> 00:32:39.440]
Well, he's now we know he's not going anywhere. We got him for as long as we want when Bob Neal said in there with your friend Bob all

[00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:44.920]
Lou and said yeah, we want you to retire with us about make the deal if you want to make it up for 10 years 15 years

[00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:46.720]
What and that's that's a true story

[00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:49.800]
Yeah, make make the middle for as long as you want because we want you to work

[00:32:50.260 --> 00:32:52.780]
For W. I. Do until you croak something like that

[00:32:53.380 --> 00:32:56.520]
Or until we make you croak and they're working until you're croak

[00:32:56.520 --> 00:33:02.440]
So I did it without any agent without any advice with that and that they manipulated me at that position because I'm weak

[00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:05.260]
Unlike you who finally after a better late than never

[00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:08.480]
Wiesed up and got yourself an agent and still going to wind up working for cock

[00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:14.040]
Well, yeah, so you're you're taught no at least you're going to a great market in a big radio station

[00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:18.440]
But you're still working for a horsecraft company, which I know you can't comment on but you know, it's true

[00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:24.640]
They fired honestly me. They fired you in Atlanta. Yeah, they did fire a mark. They fired me in Atlanta. Yeah, G. M.

[00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:27.120]
An Atlanta fired me. That's true. Yeah, when I was in Atlanta

[00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:30.740]
Uh, I wasn't they giving you know, I felt like Rod's

[00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:34.500]
No, I'm not talking in this market whatsoever. They haven't their head unlike us

[00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:40.080]
No, no, but seriously, but wait a minute. They like him. They hate us. I'm a pan in the ass you forget it all together

[00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:41.100]
They hate us

[00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:45.400]
But they like him and they still haven't done anything for him that to me

[00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:49.200]
I mean if they like you if they love you and they still want to lift a finger to promote you

[00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:53.320]
Give me that's it all but that's what they do to promote you guys it was not

[00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:57.540]
A form across the board. Not a thing in the beginning in the beginning when I first came here

[00:33:57.540 --> 00:34:01.120]
And you were we had a son we had billboards. We had the great campaign

[00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:04.720]
But since I got here they haven't done that's another thing you're talking about they haven't done for anybody

[00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:07.840]
We had the numbers with a billboard now you did the numbers without the billboard

[00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:09.900]
You came here

[00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:14.240]
You came here you were a new kid on the block nobody in Miami had any idea who you were

[00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:18.840]
They had never been exposed to your act. They still wear his he was on waxy. I've been here for 20 years

[00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:21.000]
So they could always justify well

[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:24.820]
I we don't need to promote those guys. They got their own built in cum nobody knew from Phil Henry

[00:34:24.820 --> 00:34:29.420]
And they also probably figure well. It's just gonna sound like I make him excuses then if I say well

[00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:34.660]
Why should Rick be the only one? Yeah, it's all bad. I'm just saying that it was a uniform black

[00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:37.940]
Of the kind of promotion you're talking about

[00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:42.840]
Uh, they did do a TV campaign in the spring in 94 and they brought it back. Yeah

[00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:48.300]
We had two golf tournaments, which you're a thing right there one of these what's mine right in front of you

[00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:50.760]
A coserier. Yeah, he's pop it. He's starting to pop on the room screen

[00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:55.240]
Um, we had a couple of golf tournaments, which I think they promoted pretty well, you know

[00:34:56.180 --> 00:34:57.040]
Yeah, well, they did

[00:34:58.260 --> 00:35:02.220]
How about the trip to Ireland Phil they did that on your behalf of Ireland? Oh my god

[00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:04.740]
Phil Henry turns into a corporate suck. Oh

[00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:08.880]
The trip to Ireland trip to Ireland and then they ran around town everybody

[00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:11.780]
It's because you have no credibility and everybody thought it was a put on

[00:35:11.780 --> 00:35:16.220]
I know the guy who booked the trip by the way the guy in LA. No don't know the guy your

[00:35:16.220 --> 00:35:20.400]
Listen to the guy the one guy who bought Robertson. I think you bought two or four of them or something

[00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:24.400]
I got a letter from the guy in Los Angeles who was who was uh doing the trip and said

[00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:28.780]
We had a number of phone calls a curious thing people were asking were you kidding?

[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:32.220]
Yeah, like a hundred phone calls for people to know if it was a joke or not tonight

[00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:36.460]
I don't think people are even aware that Neil and I aren't here. It's just you that that was um

[00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:42.400]
That was the the first time did you and I also that was the first time that I actually learned how to do us all now

[00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:45.700]
While we were talking over each other which you so where would I go?

[00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:47.880]
You know, I want to hear more of this career advice on a year

[00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:52.660]
New York is the obvious place if we got all these if they have these so-called

[00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:56.420]
Tell it like it is hosts in New York and I and I can't say I've never heard Lynn Samuels

[00:35:56.420 --> 00:35:58.940]
But they have the you know the Bob Grant and everybody in your

[00:35:58.940 --> 00:36:01.960]
Bob Grant well the so-called in your face. Oh

[00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:07.200]
Jesus this man's been dead for 20 years that New York has the New Yorkers got the flexibility and the

[00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:10.320]
Calist skin to yeah to really enjoy your show, you know

[00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:14.800]
You guys are perfect for what? What is the benefit for him though?

[00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:19.840]
So what your thing is that LA is too laid back which is what they're famous for they would never put up no no not at all

[00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:24.740]
Not Los Angeles to be great for you, you know, I just a lot of fags out New York should be more of your kind of a

[00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:29.400]
Press is a lot of fags in New York New York is more of a no-one is boss is in North the Northeast is more of your kind of a

[00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:30.920]
What is the benefit of New York though?

[00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:32.880]
Larger. Yeah, is it money?

[00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:38.500]
You've got more for the whole of New York you've got you've got every syndicate or in every network in the world sitting up there

[00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:42.600]
Waiting to just put you right about working down here. Who the hell ever hears people don't hear you

[00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:47.880]
You've got all right you my amy audience that here you and I love you and it would not your you're missing my point

[00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:51.420]
But I'm talking about in terms of you've got people in the industry up there right CBS ABC

[00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:57.600]
I'm sure one all these other companies that are gonna sit there and all my amy's up and coming look at the guys who have gone to New York

[00:36:57.600 --> 00:37:01.480]
Or to Los Angeles who it within five seconds got a television deal

[00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:05.880]
Mark and Brian yeah, you guys within five seconds were out of a television Brian

[00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:11.980]
But they got a TV show at NBC didn't they for a day mother love goes out there for who's it Stephanie Miller does a night time

[00:37:11.980 --> 00:37:17.760]
Sure KFI she gets a TV offer to go to Fox. Oh, yeah, love was the same thing all of these guys all the same lot

[00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:23.320]
They mean they're already there. Huh? They're already there. They're all in the same lot radio TV. It's all

[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:29.140]
One you're about if you got some talent you go out there and you can make something really happen as opposed to getting

[00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:34.720]
Excited over the first TV gig and not having it so in other words what you're saying is instead of like planning for the 30th of September

[00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:40.860]
It's going to work for the pack and what we ought to be doing behind the scenes is talking to all these agents in New York and

[00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:43.360]
plotting to get out of here and just guys

[00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:48.440]
You know what we can talk about it. You know what it reminds me of years ago in between radio jobs

[00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:52.320]
I was um, I went to work for snowing and snowing. Do you know what they are?

[00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:54.600]
No, snowing and snowing is an

[00:37:54.600 --> 00:38:02.060]
Expenses and an employment agency and what they do is they hire people that they can't find jobs for and you sit around and you pretend

[00:38:02.060 --> 00:38:03.460]
That you're going to find jobs for other guys

[00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:10.680]
And you seriously you read the one ads in the paper and you call these people up and you try to get their permission to have a listing

[00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:16.180]
So that when some guy comes to you you really con him into believing that you're going to find him a job and of course you never do

[00:38:16.780 --> 00:38:21.940]
So anyway, it was during the Thanksgiving holiday. This is a true story. There were about six of us who are the counselors

[00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:27.880]
and the the boss who was got to be dead by now, but anyways name was George

[00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:34.520]
Was this old bizarre really weird guy and we had one young lady who was working for us one of the counselors

[00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:37.360]
And she was getting these crank heavy breathing calls at home, you know

[00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:40.540]
You know this stuff and one morning at the

[00:38:40.540 --> 00:38:45.680]
Seriously at the meeting I'm just wondering where Johnny Dolan was the boss pops up. Maybe it was John

[00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:50.760]
The boss George pops up and says hey, uh, Susie you're not getting any crank calls lately are you?

[00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:57.960]
True story nobody ever told him she was getting crank calls, but somehow this boss knew

[00:38:58.480 --> 00:38:58.960]
George

[00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:06.260]
So anyway, we all all six of us because the pay was like minimal at best and the guy was an asshole

[00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:11.380]
And it was just the total scam and so we decided that we were all gonna quit at the same time

[00:39:12.380 --> 00:39:17.040]
And we did and we had the holiday weekend for Thanksgiving and Monday

[00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:21.880]
Monday play and the guy walked in and we're all empty orifice is every desk was empty

[00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:22.680]
There was nobody there

[00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:28.280]
And he had a people sitting out in the waiting room waiting for imaginary people to find them jobs who didn't exist

[00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:33.420]
And you what you're saying is we should do the same thing the pactions that would you would like us to do with that make you feel better

[00:39:33.420 --> 00:39:38.140]
I'll tell you what and I'm being very honest that I know that people would like we can talk about

[00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:42.640]
Are you a paid agent of Cox enterprise now you trying to sabotage the sale of the radio station?

[00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:45.540]
No because you know the truth is that

[00:39:45.540 --> 00:39:49.300]
In Cox would admit this coax does want to talk to agents either, you know

[00:39:49.300 --> 00:39:55.100]
They know company does you know, yeah, and I don't think that my agent has any better relationship with with

[00:39:55.100 --> 00:40:00.060]
I have mine. I have an agent. They won't talk to him. I had to negotiate my own deal. Let's still pay my agent

[00:40:00.060 --> 00:40:03.860]
Yeah, that's the way business business goes

[00:40:03.860 --> 00:40:08.460]
But I still have my guy talking to them about a side syndication deal if and when that happens

[00:40:08.460 --> 00:40:11.100]
But anyway the point is we can sit and talk about companies

[00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:17.880]
Radio companies down to the years lie to talent and we know this sometimes you work for better guys and sometimes you don't

[00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:24.640]
But the time has come where you have to seize the moment sees the events at the tide as Shakespeare said and to

[00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:28.600]
So what you're saying is what you're saying is man

[00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:36.400]
All I had to do is

[00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:38.180]
I've been hearing this from you off the year

[00:40:38.180 --> 00:40:46.440]
That what you have to do don't you understand I have a contract now do you really think I mean your contract your contract got two years left free

[00:40:47.140 --> 00:40:54.480]
Three years and two months see guys renegotiating which they planned on being they planned on you being dead by then if you remember the memo

[00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:57.500]
They came out it was posted on the wall we have him for any company

[00:40:57.920 --> 00:41:02.440]
Uh, and saying that you need to go to go to go to my deal with who with Paxon in other words either you're gonna pay me more

[00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:08.960]
I'm not coming to work. Is that what you're saying? I would think that the time would be opportune to renegotiate with a new owner

[00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:10.460]
Wouldn't you am I am I wrong?

[00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:15.920]
With a new owner wouldn't you think that it would be a proposal? How can you do that you can't

[00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:21.000]
Being very sweet. Let me ask you this question

[00:41:21.460 --> 00:41:29.120]
Is it possible that I'm satisfied within the confines of reality in the this market that I'm satisfied with how much I'm making

[00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:33.720]
I think you're satisfied with how much you're making. I think that I think that you

[00:41:34.420 --> 00:41:39.780]
Deep down desire a a larger piece a large broadcast industry

[00:41:39.780 --> 00:41:42.960]
No question about that. That's right. I would like to be able to talk to

[00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:49.680]
Living in people in Boston, New York L.A. But when you work for Cox broadcasting and they put you on here in Key West on the station

[00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:53.160]
It's got the towering on a ground. It was laying on it. That's a true story

[00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:55.560]
That's not can do and then they put you on for my own

[00:41:56.240 --> 00:41:59.660]
That's never shown up with one diary in the arbitrage for my own

[00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:05.020]
Let me put you on SU when they put a Jew Fag from upstate New York on here in Tampa with a bunch of red legs

[00:42:05.020 --> 00:42:06.640]
It's not conducive to

[00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:12.820]
Enhancing your career that is that's you're in your mind right? You're your so in other words you're eating a lot of stuff

[00:42:12.820 --> 00:42:19.020]
You think that SU when you think that the tap of thing is as is known across the country and Neil Rogers is not a

[00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:23.020]
marketable product because he didn't happen no no that's not what I just said

[00:42:23.020 --> 00:42:27.520]
I said that putting us on in those markets wasn't conducive to creating what you're talking about

[00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:33.120]
We never had an opportunity that may well be but we're talking about one you know, we're talking about there's a lot of different companies right

[00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:37.240]
There's a lot of different ways of doing what he's trying to say is had it button done well

[00:42:37.780 --> 00:42:40.600]
Then maybe you know maybe not we have a chance

[00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:47.600]
They can't or it's turns not on in Tampa by the right I'm this is and I miss has like fractions there. Yeah, marginal number

[00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:54.140]
So what does Tampa prove Tampa proves nothing we actually have like all radio market absolute orders are really ugly. It's a redneck state

[00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:55.920]
redneck and

[00:42:56.420 --> 00:43:02.740]
If it's a funny thing for a radio station like wiod to succeed as it has in a market in a city where there's one comedy club

[00:43:02.740 --> 00:43:06.060]
The comedy scene here's not supported at all. There's no local comics

[00:43:06.060 --> 00:43:09.300]
I mean they're out in the only comedy club that's open is out in West Brow

[00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:14.220]
I don't even know what city it's in any comedy clubs do well. Yeah manyapolis of all the rotten

[00:43:14.220 --> 00:43:18.780]
What do you know? I don't want to go outside. That's right, but I mean Chicago and only people with a great sense of human

[00:43:18.780 --> 00:43:24.340]
I'll tell you what I mean. They've got they've got seven or eight great comedy clubs Chicago, New York

[00:43:25.620 --> 00:43:32.120]
DC LA San Francisco comedy scene just just blossoms in those places and here's here's Miami where there is

[00:43:32.780 --> 00:43:34.320]
People seem to be humor impaired

[00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:38.160]
You know, you know, just don't more impaired speech the language

[00:43:38.780 --> 00:43:44.080]
Well, whatever. So I mean the point that I'm making is that there are there are larger horizons

[00:43:44.220 --> 00:43:47.640]
And as a member of the American Federation of Television Radio artists

[00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:52.260]
These all are you a fan dormant are you a fan? I wish you say yeah, American Fag

[00:43:52.260 --> 00:43:57.900]
That's why he wants me out. Yeah, are you a no, I'm not a member. You're not a you know. I could join them. No, I am. That's not a problem dormant

[00:43:57.900 --> 00:43:59.540]
They let fags in dormant

[00:44:00.060 --> 00:44:01.080]
255 at wiod

[00:44:01.540 --> 00:44:07.900]
To an old and guess who's next the Jets beautiful dolphins on radio

[00:44:07.900 --> 00:44:10.100]
Use talking entertainment radio

[00:44:11.020 --> 00:44:13.420]
16 W I O D

[00:44:15.060 --> 00:44:17.420]
Ligrid way how you just can't miss it

[00:44:20.080 --> 00:44:21.880]
Use talking entertainment radio

[00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:25.560]
610 w i o d

[00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:29.140]
So the deal is we're all going to k fi we didn't want to pack some people to know

[00:44:29.140 --> 00:44:32.860]
But we're all gonna be leaving on the same bus and we're all going to LA good. It's going amtrak

[00:44:32.860 --> 00:44:37.080]
Wouldn't that you would feel better about that you'd feel like like it linus and the security stay in the company

[00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:41.780]
I think and the longer you stayed with Cox the more you'd recognize that I think they do have your best interests at heart

[00:44:41.780 --> 00:44:44.420]
And that's how you just said during the break

[00:44:44.420 --> 00:44:46.620]
There you go. That's how we just said during the break

[00:44:47.340 --> 00:44:52.720]
Oh, man. Okay, what he just said about these people during the break. Oh crap

[00:44:53.500 --> 00:44:56.800]
Like you'd like I was telling you if they would have put us on a year on and k fi

[00:44:56.800 --> 00:45:01.140]
Uh, even though there's the three-hour time difference. Mm-hmm. What would be wrong with that?

[00:45:01.420 --> 00:45:06.420]
I'm gonna show up a switch. I could do a show from like noon to four which would be nine to one out there

[00:45:07.480 --> 00:45:10.900]
Right? Yeah, before here. Yeah. What would be wrong with that?

[00:45:11.780 --> 00:45:15.500]
If you did your show what noon to four here and that's nine to one out there

[00:45:15.500 --> 00:45:19.160]
So wouldn't screw with their morning drive show which probably is five tonight and by the way that show

[00:45:19.160 --> 00:45:22.680]
If you heard that show handle. Yeah. Oh my god. Yeah

[00:45:23.980 --> 00:45:24.380]
Grotesque

[00:45:24.380 --> 00:45:28.740]
You have a second market and a company but then again keep in mind they had Tom like us on a year

[00:45:28.740 --> 00:45:32.580]
They had Tom and Tom like us who left this market in the middle of the night. Yeah, I know it

[00:45:32.580 --> 00:45:37.380]
Like the Indianapolis Colts with his Neil who bump a license tag on the back

[00:45:37.380 --> 00:45:41.660]
By the way speaking of Tom like it penis Arizona who he was doing pretty well in LA

[00:45:41.780 --> 00:45:45.700]
And I haven't I know what he's making and you're making more than he is right now. He was doing pretty well in LA

[00:45:45.700 --> 00:45:49.900]
You know, they did research on Tom like is they found out that people because he did one of these issues shows

[00:45:49.900 --> 00:45:54.620]
And he had her urban from the JDL on and he had all of the Tom Mester from the area nations and he did a lot of these

[00:45:55.460 --> 00:45:57.340]
explosive issue type shows

[00:45:57.840 --> 00:45:58.200]
um

[00:45:59.060 --> 00:46:03.720]
They finally found out that people tuned into a show to hear the issues they didn't necessarily didn't necessarily learn him

[00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:07.220]
Yeah, yeah, and and he never did really break through in LA

[00:46:07.740 --> 00:46:13.660]
In four and a half years in terms of in terms of just base numbers, but what's he gonna break through it? He's a piece of crap

[00:46:14.340 --> 00:46:16.660]
He is Tom like us is not a talent

[00:46:17.380 --> 00:46:23.920]
He uh he got a lot of ink and he got a lot of uh notarai. He's a self-promoter. Oh, yeah, you're the best I've ever seen

[00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:25.780]
Yeah, and if you had that skill

[00:46:26.500 --> 00:46:29.540]
Yeah, if you had like us to skill itself from or if I had a good agent

[00:46:29.540 --> 00:46:31.740]
It's right who wasn't in jail at the moment

[00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:36.000]
Okay, so I got a great agent. He just happens to be in person. Okay

[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:38.160]
And saying at the moment for the next 10

[00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:39.880]
You got what you who's your guy?

[00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:41.360]
Boss stiff

[00:46:44.260 --> 00:46:45.700]
No, that's in my deal

[00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:51.240]
That's in the original September 30th. How did that date happen? No, no, I'm just I'm just saying it's after a year of the change

[00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:56.420]
Whatever the date would be I just gave you the date. I was just any new company guys guys guys can I just kiss Jennifer goodbye?

[00:46:57.260 --> 00:46:59.340]
Are you gonna start picking on poor Jennifer again?

[00:46:59.800 --> 00:47:04.220]
She loves you. She didn't get to rip me and I just wanted to let her know that I was you know

[00:47:04.780 --> 00:47:09.760]
She thinks you're wasting your time. Yeah, okay. We're gonna take some calls all that we hit every line lit up

[00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:13.340]
Right when we work on a ticket. He calls now that we are gonna take calls. They all flew away

[00:47:13.340 --> 00:47:19.560]
What's like I said? It's an unfriendly crowd bokeh hey guys. Yes, sir mutiny at the bay. Yeah

[00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:27.100]
Rick and such show no can't deal with it very boring and unfunny yeah

[00:47:27.620 --> 00:47:30.820]
And those little promos that they run yeah the worst

[00:47:31.460 --> 00:47:35.620]
Anybody who doesn't listen to the show who listens to one of those promos

[00:47:35.620 --> 00:47:38.000]
Listen to the show okay

[00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:45.300]
So you're out. So maybe the show is okay, but the promo suck do you ever think about that?

[00:47:47.020 --> 00:47:54.740]
Very briefly. Yeah, but I don't know if those are Steve Nichols idea or what but those promos are awful

[00:47:55.240 --> 00:48:00.020]
They're not funny and what about and what about the other day parts? They're in the summer

[00:48:00.020 --> 00:48:03.440]
Phil Hendry. Yeah, that's show I've ever heard there you go

[00:48:03.440 --> 00:48:09.780]
That's number two vote best show in the man Miami and he's leaving us. I know what's gonna happen. Yeah, that's what makes it the best

[00:48:09.780 --> 00:48:15.860]
Okay, you're show neil. It's just kind of rolls along. Yeah, I'm just like that's what I said a few months ago

[00:48:15.860 --> 00:48:20.580]
I'm just like an old comfortable shoe and I'm just rolls along and I'm just here not that great

[00:48:20.580 --> 00:48:23.640]
When you're going to do some yard work, you just throw on that old comfortable

[00:48:23.640 --> 00:48:25.320]
Right, that's it a little dirt right

[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:29.440]
You know, I I mode along so see it's good. It's good that you're leaving Phil

[00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:32.560]
It's good because now I can be you know number one kid on the block again

[00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:35.100]
But keep proud. It's a direction. Okay. I'm here at

[00:48:35.100 --> 00:48:40.440]
Yeah, like Jennifer said jump in your car go home work on your show and you'll get better all right

[00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:43.760]
Okay, right now. Thanks for the advice. Okay, it's in front of me

[00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:46.080]
Miami on the purple line. Hello

[00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:47.540]
I forget it

[00:48:47.540 --> 00:48:50.460]
Rick don't even bother going home trying to work on it

[00:48:50.460 --> 00:48:52.380]
I got you know on the head

[00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:54.720]
You are without a doubt

[00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:57.120]
the most that is the worst

[00:48:57.760 --> 00:49:00.240]
Thing I've ever heard my life on the radio

[00:49:01.220 --> 00:49:03.800]
Without a doubt. Yeah, it's just

[00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:05.040]
All right, now let me ask you this

[00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:11.020]
Sir, sir if we brought back Chuck Meyer, do you think that it might like soften up the edges a little bit

[00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:14.020]
Nothing can help it. It's a worst

[00:49:14.520 --> 00:49:22.180]
If I talk them this phone for 36 hours, I couldn't scratch the surface of beginning to tell you just how terrible you are

[00:49:22.180 --> 00:49:26.960]
Well, how about 52 minutes you have you have not a single funny bone in your body

[00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:32.500]
Never heard one thing that I can even listen to for a minute your tail what my pants

[00:49:32.500 --> 00:49:38.080]
Get another career to get out of it. You're terrible. Nobody likes you guys have no talent

[00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:42.700]
Your day above that's dark. Ace Grazer losers beat it

[00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:49.200]
But what does he really think so that I hate people to beat around your myelin. You're taking a

[00:49:49.760 --> 00:49:54.100]
You know, but see that's one thing about the iod audience and even though they're listening to my show

[00:49:54.100 --> 00:49:58.480]
I'm just I'm not really that good. I'm just you know, I'm just here and there's nothing a lot of yard work

[00:49:58.480 --> 00:50:02.100]
They're doing a lot of yard work and they're killing some time and I'm perfect for that. That's good

[00:50:02.100 --> 00:50:08.820]
Like you said Phil, I think there's a lot of other greener pastures out there. Here's how lady hello. Yes, ma'am

[00:50:08.820 --> 00:50:12.980]
I think you're great to make my day now who you're talking to oh

[00:50:13.820 --> 00:50:17.400]
Thank God that some old lady likes me. Thank God. Thanks mom

[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:20.440]
I'll stop with that one. What about the Rick and Spud?

[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:25.680]
Would you do me a favor? What's that? Would you play the tape about your own? Yeah, okay

[00:50:27.120 --> 00:50:29.140]
See that's my crowd. That's all I got left

[00:50:29.140 --> 00:50:32.740]
Well, when you've been here for 50 years and your median demographic is death. What do you expect?

[00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:34.580]
Plantation hello

[00:50:35.620 --> 00:50:37.660]
Like Rick and Spud yeah right

[00:50:39.380 --> 00:50:43.660]
Yeah, but I have to admit when they had Marvin and Chuck myron all that the show was better

[00:50:44.300 --> 00:50:48.180]
Yeah, Marvin sure is how was a lot more entertaining than Adam was Marvin on your show

[00:50:48.180 --> 00:50:48.680]
Oh

[00:50:49.740 --> 00:50:54.920]
The best thing that Marvin used to do is show up and show it to the almost over yeah and tell Jennifer to shut up

[00:50:54.920 --> 00:50:56.740]
She's no Dorothy McIntyre herself

[00:50:57.300 --> 00:50:58.720]
She stuck yeah

[00:50:59.560 --> 00:51:06.300]
Where's I mean rick's alright. He just it's not his crowd in the morning put him in afternoons and see what see what they see what happens

[00:51:06.300 --> 00:51:10.960]
Give it a shot. Okay, and Phil Henry the best the best

[00:51:11.820 --> 00:51:17.160]
I hope he could be someone casted some down here someday. Okay, and now you're the best now

[00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:18.300]
And I'm the best

[00:51:18.300 --> 00:51:23.600]
Phil's the best and I'm the best and Rick is okay. He's good. He's weak. He's all right

[00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:28.940]
Fair okay. Thanks. Okay, so we finally got one. I said you're okay not that good, but

[00:51:29.580 --> 00:51:33.400]
Open line of brow art five two four nine four six three five two four WIdeen

[00:51:33.400 --> 00:51:35.560]
In other words, my show is okay for while you're gardening and while you're

[00:51:36.380 --> 00:51:36.820]
What you're doing?

[00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:42.360]
Rick and suds when you're doing a good douche here's a mobile in Miami. Hello. Oh, oh, yeah, sir

[00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:46.440]
I don't think it's fair that you know people are people that are calling in are judging

[00:51:46.440 --> 00:51:47.500]
Rick and suds

[00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:51.560]
Lot of reply just listeners that listen to only you. I mean there are different

[00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:55.360]
Well, I don't have too many good things to say about me either that's one good thing about the iodee audience

[00:51:55.360 --> 00:51:58.180]
They don't like anybody you huh? They still listen to you. I mean

[00:51:58.180 --> 00:52:03.100]
I think the guy that just called and just peed nothing but hey probably does not listen to Rick and suds

[00:52:03.100 --> 00:52:05.520]
I mean I listen to all three of you and

[00:52:05.900 --> 00:52:11.720]
With an ever-sending concert because that's what I'm in the car most and I you know there's different things to enjoy about each different show

[00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:12.000]
Yeah

[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:17.460]
Uh each each show I'm sure there's people who listen to Rick and sud that wouldn't turn the radio when you're on for nothing

[00:52:17.460 --> 00:52:20.680]
You're in seed. Thank God, you know, but that's uh that's just

[00:52:20.680 --> 00:52:24.200]
Different like different women in different food. You have to enjoy different things about them

[00:52:24.860 --> 00:52:27.640]
Right in your own right. I mean Rick and suds are great

[00:52:28.420 --> 00:52:32.400]
Uh your god and uh full of the antichrist and uh, you know, I just uh

[00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:34.840]
I enjoyed all three of them for different reasons

[00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:39.240]
I don't think we have a lot of crossover and go there between no

[00:52:39.240 --> 00:52:43.660]
Show and go pants. I think each show has its own audience. I think you're probably the only guy. Oh

[00:52:43.660 --> 00:52:46.340]
20 up talk for your talk. I can't listen to all they love. Yeah

[00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:48.260]
Thanks a lot pal

[00:52:48.720 --> 00:52:49.560]
Okay, there's the one

[00:52:49.960 --> 00:52:50.720]
Now I think you're right

[00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:53.460]
I think there is no crossover because I know when I come on a 10 o'clock

[00:52:53.460 --> 00:52:56.460]
We had a phone as dead as a doornail in fact, why don't you just to follow Ranieri

[00:52:56.960 --> 00:53:01.680]
Which we had very little crossover it was you know the first 10 15 minutes as I was sitting here be yesen

[00:53:01.680 --> 00:53:05.700]
Uh the lines would be lit and then by the time I finished with the first break we're rocking and rolling

[00:53:05.700 --> 00:53:07.500]
Now it's like wow

[00:53:08.520 --> 00:53:09.320]
Death deadly

[00:53:09.740 --> 00:53:12.060]
You mean there was crossover between you and Ranieri? Yeah

[00:53:12.880 --> 00:53:16.220]
Amazingly enough even though we did an entirely different show. We had older demographics

[00:53:16.220 --> 00:53:21.300]
But there was there was something there. There was some continuity now. It's like there's a just a total

[00:53:22.080 --> 00:53:25.980]
For all of this criticism that you got you're taking no, he's not it's not criticism

[00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:30.320]
It's just a fact. I'm not making that I'm not saying you know, I mean the people on the phone

[00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:33.400]
We ever had a situation like we have the last few months where every I mean

[00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:38.880]
I sit here for like 10 minutes and I'm rambling on and you you're expecting to see you know here they come nothing right

[00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:42.060]
Well, I know that I know but yeah, you know that for four hours

[00:53:42.060 --> 00:53:46.020]
But you don't but you don't need the calls you've got all these your own calls

[00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:49.220]
Um, but your boy are you lucky about that?

[00:53:49.520 --> 00:53:51.440]
You're probably going to

[00:53:52.560 --> 00:53:56.260]
L.A. here longer than any I'm going to L.A. You're probably gonna be here longer than me

[00:53:56.260 --> 00:53:59.460]
Yeah, cuz I'll be retired one of five years. I'm gonna be on here. You'll be the Dean

[00:53:59.460 --> 00:54:02.640]
You're probably on the Dean of Miami radio. Yeah, there we go for all of this this

[00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:04.440]
Oh, I hope not strongly

[00:54:06.420 --> 00:54:13.460]
Attitude about you guys and and that's because you guys have been around a long time people have strong feelings about your positive negative whatever

[00:54:13.460 --> 00:54:17.360]
You know, that's interesting that you would say that they kind of sound like something or Ron Benican's

[00:54:17.860 --> 00:54:18.260]
Benican's

[00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:21.720]
Benican, I remember him right

[00:54:21.720 --> 00:54:22.920]
Right, the saffron

[00:54:22.920 --> 00:54:26.900]
Yes, you're not a pelican because he's my I've only been up since three. I've had no sleep. It's okay

[00:54:26.900 --> 00:54:32.140]
I got one eye open. I can deal with this. Don't start making excuses again. Next you'll be blaming Dorothy McIntyre for it

[00:54:32.140 --> 00:54:32.820]
Yeah, you know

[00:54:33.420 --> 00:54:37.580]
Well, uh Jennifer said to go home and do some show prep food or do some gardening

[00:54:40.500 --> 00:54:47.780]
1113 at WIOD do add on to your existing home planning a new pool or just thinking of been closing a patio

[00:54:48.300 --> 00:54:50.580]
Well, then why don't you hire a carpenter?

[00:54:51.500 --> 00:54:55.260]
Feel hindry two to six p.m. On news talk and entertainment radio

[00:54:55.260 --> 00:54:57.300]
16 WIOD

[00:54:57.300 --> 00:55:01.340]
Okay, once 16 what do you mean how long before the audience figures their back on there's this is

[00:55:01.880 --> 00:55:06.120]
Pax and you're gonna be a billboards and ads and TV spots and

[00:55:06.120 --> 00:55:12.340]
Now we'll sandwich boards green savers will they will they return to the a.m. Dial for run and run. I don't know

[00:55:12.340 --> 00:55:18.960]
You know, I mean see that's the thing that's the question how many people in any given market can change can move an audience

[00:55:18.960 --> 00:55:23.700]
As they say that's what the programmers call it moving the audience. Can you move them from a m to fm?

[00:55:23.780 --> 00:55:27.320]
Can you move them from station one to station two? Can you move them from one day part to another?

[00:55:27.320 --> 00:55:34.400]
That's the true test. Yeah, and and how many of them seriously can figure out how to do is you know

[00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:36.340]
I mean you get a lot of people calling and say you know

[00:55:36.340 --> 00:55:39.820]
We went out and we did that don't get done. You're on a m. What is that a m? What number?

[00:55:40.520 --> 00:55:47.220]
610 and you'll right and when you don't say 97 points something because you're dealing with people who are not familiar with the a.m. World

[00:55:47.220 --> 00:55:48.360]
It's not part of their lives

[00:55:48.360 --> 00:55:54.360]
They didn't grow up with it and they had never had any reason in this market to turn it on Adam told me is actually called in car windows

[00:55:54.360 --> 00:55:58.000]
Telling people and punch the band button for them to show them where they're

[00:56:01.240 --> 00:56:07.380]
Well, that's encouraged. That's a nice code. Yeah, very good. So it's well buddy. Bud says the future of radios on a m. Miami. Hello

[00:56:08.660 --> 00:56:14.680]
Miami. Hello. Yes, sir. How you doing? You can't hear you. How you doing? Neil? Okay. All right. Well, basically I hit the point

[00:56:14.680 --> 00:56:16.880]
I couldn't take it anymore as far as I'm concerned

[00:56:17.360 --> 00:56:24.340]
All today you have an ex on the show

[00:56:24.340 --> 00:56:28.520]
And when they went to the morning you have a great show in photos still

[00:56:28.900 --> 00:56:31.720]
I mean all you bought an economy in there. There's just a bunch of thores

[00:56:32.680 --> 00:56:37.580]
Yeah, and as far as Jennifer you don't fit in sir. You have nothing negative to say you don't fit in

[00:56:37.580 --> 00:56:44.320]
No, he's a foreigner. Leave him all that's right. Okay. You'll catch on just keep listening. Okay, as far as Jennifer go ahead and do it

[00:56:44.320 --> 00:56:46.780]
Jennifer what?

[00:56:47.300 --> 00:56:52.440]
Jennifer's also she's not which she's just criticizing all Rick for staying in your show

[00:56:52.440 --> 00:56:57.540]
And the president she does she's coming back from her news and create a special credit. I think he did the same thing. He was crazy

[00:56:58.300 --> 00:57:03.900]
You know, just going on to do her own thing right make it know that I never told Jennifer what to do however

[00:57:03.900 --> 00:57:07.760]
She's told me all morning what I should be doing on my show. That's right. She'd I mean nothing

[00:57:07.760 --> 00:57:11.280]
Wasn't she the one who also did that pathetic show about the Jimmy Riding

[00:57:12.300 --> 00:57:14.700]
About the sympathetic all or Jamie did not

[00:57:14.760 --> 00:57:16.700]

Well here we were thinking you were a nice guy sir

[00:57:20.440 --> 00:57:23.620]
She did a five hour after they found the

[00:57:24.340 --> 00:57:30.440]
Five hour marathon news thing. Yeah, five hour newscast. Okay. Thank you so much. Here's a pompano hello

Now you should be a lot of that's that's the same guy that called on a green line. Yes, oh that's his

[00:57:38.300 --> 00:57:43.100]
That's his happy and funny and a lot of these people think they're actually being funny. That's their contributions

[00:57:43.100 --> 00:57:52.160]
That was pretty good. It was pretty safe to watch it. That's what I call so far. Here's Miami. Hello. A lot of enthusiasm. Miami. Hello. When is Diaz? How you doing? Okay?

[00:57:52.560 --> 00:57:58.720]
I just want to say that the rigging fudge show sucks. Yeah, yeah, Wayne get off the phone. I was a wait. Is this way?

[00:57:59.500 --> 00:58:02.480]

Yo that that jackass again the new world order NWO

[00:58:13.100 --> 00:58:19.200]
Psycho said. Uh-huh. Okay. We have an open line of dates. Seven five one, etc. Let's do a lady mobile in Miami. Hello

[00:58:19.740 --> 00:58:26.480]
Hello, I want to voice my opinion. Okay. I am a long long long time listener. I think Neil

[00:58:26.920 --> 00:58:31.360]
You helped your own I do hold my own a lot you have whatever anyway

[00:58:31.360 --> 00:58:36.780]
I think that there is nobody like Phil Henry from the moment I heard him with the cantaloupe in the peach

[00:58:36.780 --> 00:58:41.620]
I said who is this guy as I knew he was a genius and there's nobody better

[00:58:41.620 --> 00:58:45.100]
And I'm ready to move to LA. I have every friend waiting to hear him

[00:58:45.100 --> 00:58:50.660]
I just think if I own the station I'd have paid any amount of money to keep him because I think he's a genius

[00:58:50.660 --> 00:58:52.980]
Well, now you know why Cox won't let him muggle

[00:58:52.980 --> 00:58:55.100]
I didn't believe it. Well, I just don't get it

[00:58:55.100 --> 00:58:57.940]
But that's besides the point and as far as Rick and sad

[00:58:58.500 --> 00:59:01.580]
I used to listen because they were the only thing in town

[00:59:01.580 --> 00:59:06.300]
And I'm sorry to say that it's like my afternoon is spent all the time in the car

[00:59:06.300 --> 00:59:09.840]
I mean am I gonna suffer with WFPL or something because

[00:59:09.840 --> 00:59:14.500]
I'm just not a Rick and Sudsman and I feel sorry that I guess maybe my business will pick up

[00:59:14.500 --> 00:59:16.040]
I'll start you know going in

[00:59:17.360 --> 00:59:19.760]
Well see there's a blessing in this guy's for you

[00:59:20.240 --> 00:59:22.900]
Every dark cloud has got the requirement in the middle

[00:59:22.900 --> 00:59:24.220]
All right, we're having like

[00:59:25.420 --> 00:59:28.920]
Such withdrawals. We're all gonna miss Phil. We don't know what we're gonna do with our lives

[00:59:28.920 --> 00:59:34.180]
Like we didn't have a life without him. Yeah, well try and do a lot of gardening. Yeah, right. Okay

[00:59:34.780 --> 00:59:38.520]
Thanks, we don't I'll help you through it the gardening show that's yeah, I missed my calling

[00:59:38.520 --> 00:59:41.340]

[00:59:41.960 --> 00:59:46.240]
We have an open line a day at 751 Kvets. It's 121 at WIO dealer

[00:59:47.240 --> 00:59:49.380]

[00:59:51.940 --> 00:59:54.480]
Okay, you look just as bad at 915 as you do now

124 at WIO D here's a pompano. Hello. Hey guys. How's it going? Yes sir great

[01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:07.400]
I didn't know we had Milrose place on the damn radio now. We got a top that you do. I'll tell you what and um

[01:00:07.880 --> 01:00:12.560]
I listened to all three of you guys all day long and there's a lot of guys out there like me

[01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:18.260]
I didn't I don't have a chance to call you guys all day because I work and you know, I got off early today and off work too

[01:00:18.260 --> 01:00:23.340]
Um, I'll tell you what rake. You got a really good show in the morning. It's about the only thing worth a damn

[01:00:23.340 --> 01:00:28.100]
Bless you, sir. Hey, no problem. Uh, or maybe I'm just bored. I don't know

[01:00:28.100 --> 01:00:28.480]
Thanks

[01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:31.360]
Bless you again. All right

[01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:33.920]
I was almost

[01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:36.940]
Yeah, I like to put on the other ring. I almost touched it

[01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:43.700]
All right guys, that's all I got to say. Thanks a lot. Okay. Thanks. Thanks so much. There's a real good compliment for you

[01:00:43.700 --> 01:00:47.380]
No, I'm leaving in six minutes redlands. Hello. Hey, this is Douglas

[01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:48.940]
aka rat boy

[01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:55.320]
There is rat boy. I was I was calling to say I am one of the many crossovers out there

[01:00:55.320 --> 01:01:01.180]
And I think that the bloodbath is occurring because the the station hasn't promoted you guys the way it should have

[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.120]
And I think there's actually a pretty big

[01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:04.900]
crossover

[01:01:04.900 --> 01:01:12.420]
But it's just not the kind of people who get you know ratings books unfortunately to fill them out and because we're in the minority here and and so

[01:01:12.980 --> 01:01:14.100]
W does not

[01:01:14.100 --> 01:01:19.240]
Pair to be doing as well as it really is you know when the little slips of paper come across the desk

[01:01:19.240 --> 01:01:23.860]
It doesn't say what's really happening. It certainly doesn't reflect um, that's good. I like that

[01:01:23.860 --> 01:01:28.420]
What does that mean a ratings in midday are pretty good ratings in afternoon or back up there

[01:01:28.420 --> 01:01:35.740]
They're pretty strong. No, I'm not talking about she's out so no, I think they are but I think that your ratings are probably not as high as they really are

[01:01:35.740 --> 01:01:40.060]
What are you saying is he's like to be a part of this no way no no way man. Who's ratings are not as high?

[01:01:40.140 --> 01:01:43.740]
We're talking about no all three of you. I think it fills, kneels and rick and suds writing

[01:01:43.740 --> 01:01:46.620]
I think that all of your ratings are not as high as they would be

[01:01:46.620 --> 01:01:52.600]
Because of the demographic that's represented if you looked at the demographic that's representative of who could and would be listening to you

[01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:54.860]
I don't think that any of them dial

[01:01:55.620 --> 01:01:56.980]
No, this man's got a plug

[01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:03.000]
It's people who would never fill out a diary on a bet because they make it all kinds of money and I would not

[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:08.880]
Live or do busy to do it exactly. I will listen to you all day and and because I would listen to you and I like you all

[01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:10.440]
I would fill out the book if it came

[01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:14.540]
But I'm not going to do it for a dollar or five dollars or whatever ridiculous amount of money

[01:02:14.540 --> 01:02:18.340]
That is that they pay to do this it's a it's a poor polling method

[01:02:18.340 --> 01:02:22.600]
But if you could become an ethnic minority if you change your name to Gonzalez or get some charcoal

[01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:26.840]
They pay like probably 150 bucks a diary, you know, but it doesn't

[01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:28.000]
If I don't think it really

[01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:34.880]
Families that got 15 kids and they're all on welfare and I get the 15 diaries man five bucks a pop you're talking some serious

[01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:39.700]
Brand there's nobody in this room. There's nobody in this room that you're talking to that would fill out one either

[01:02:39.700 --> 01:02:41.920]
I think that for the people who really are your

[01:02:42.440 --> 01:02:47.560]
It's funny that you guys are all probably between like, you know, five and twelve shares depending on the day

[01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:52.340]
I got a television Nielsen diary once. Yeah, and I was really excited about it. I said look at this

[01:02:52.340 --> 01:02:53.620]
I am a Nielsen family

[01:02:57.160 --> 01:03:02.100]
Very very well, poor sure who wants to make an entire log of their entire week for a buck

[01:03:02.100 --> 01:03:05.880]
So you know what you know what I'm afraid of fill is if you got another log from the Nielsen diaries

[01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:08.980]
My favorite Martian would probably be the number one right is showing Miami

[01:03:09.540 --> 01:03:13.520]
Well, yeah, I would fill it out. You know just for kids I mean just for kicks and giggles

[01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:16.740]
I'm not doing that could could really swing things

[01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:19.260]
You could and if more people knew that

[01:03:19.260 --> 01:03:23.640]
That's right. It really screws things up here. We can really screw the methodology up exactly

[01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:25.260]
So when you next time you get a diary

[01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:31.040]
So I guess I'm just saying I don't think any of you have been done justice and did y'all to just

[01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:36.060]
Next time you get a diary will give you the extra ten bucks. I think I think I have been done justice

[01:03:36.060 --> 01:03:37.420]
I I've been offered a

[01:03:37.420 --> 01:03:42.580]
I've been offered a good position in it with a with a company in Los Angeles in hometown. Yeah, right

[01:03:42.580 --> 01:03:46.980]
I started in talk radio six years ago. I started in Ventura, California for you

[01:03:47.940 --> 01:03:51.800]
Okay, right boy. Have a great life and here's Miami under purple line. Hello

[01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:53.360]
Very hey Neil. Yes, sir

[01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:56.300]
Rick wound up right here. Well. Yeah

[01:03:56.300 --> 01:04:02.280]
I seem like it's Rick rip Rick day, but I tell you I'm a courier and I don't get a chance to call all day

[01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:05.620]
But I listen to the station all day long. I've been up and down the dial

[01:04:06.340 --> 01:04:09.060]
FM AM and everything else pretty much blows

[01:04:10.760 --> 01:04:14.980]
Okay, okay, I'm a sinked in right to the point. Thanks, Bill. That's true. Thank you so much

[01:04:14.980 --> 01:04:19.620]
Yeah, it's a pretty crappy radio market when you come right down to it. What are you gonna listen to what is there to listen to?

[01:04:20.500 --> 01:04:27.760]
Paul cash turnover. Yeah, Howard Stern right and now run and run in the fabulous sports babe. There you go

[01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:31.420]
Here's Boka. Hello. Hey guys. How you doing? Yes, sir. Hey

Just like to say I actually really like the Rick and shit that show

[01:04:35.540 --> 01:04:38.980]
Yeah, and uh, I'm just also embarrassed when you say it. Oh no, no, no

[01:04:38.980 --> 01:04:42.520]
I just listened to all three of you and I really like it and I have to say Rick

[01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:45.220]
Congratulations because before you guys came to mornings

[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:51.120]
This market was a train wreck for morning shows. It was just terrible. Thanks man. It really was

[01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:56.920]
I know I heard your first day on the air because I was in town interviewing for the job and you had on

We just went where they were I had a better news guy in the afternoon. Yeah, I don't like getting him there

Hi guys, I like all three shows. I think they're all excellent

[01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:12.460]
They're all different and I think that's what makes good radio

[01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:18.440]
I agree. I never change my dial it just stays right on w.i.o.d

[01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:20.160]
It's the only station I ever listened to

[01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:25.680]

I had that on in the office and I gotta tell you I mean the customers were just cracking out. It's hysterical

But we don't like Rick with like son. So let's have a show last year or the year before

[01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:32.000]
Such by himself is fantastic

[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:39.480]
All of us are your old 20 get rid of Rick or remind us of Steve Kane. Could we hear anybody else besides yourself since they're all there

[01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:45.840]
Jeans, I want to see you just a minute. No, just like a whole bunch of people. Well, let's just want to like one of the restaurants

[01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:47.660]
They can't one of the course a restaurant

[01:08:47.660 --> 01:08:49.120]
One of the young people

[01:08:49.120 --> 01:08:52.540]
So you took a little pole in the restaurant you remind me it's no the workers

[01:08:52.540 --> 01:08:58.640]
You remind me of deep pain and what regard you're very you're because you don't let you don't let's speak at all

[01:08:58.640 --> 01:09:03.580]
So I don't know no such has on the show for several days. He's fantastic

[01:09:04.540 --> 01:09:09.840]
He's in fact today. He's wonderful. He should be on by himself. Yeah, I agree and the rest of you are gods. Stay on

[01:09:09.840 --> 01:09:11.100]
Okay, thank you, Mrs. Spock

[01:09:11.100 --> 01:09:18.760]
Open line and day 751 talk about the baloney dispenser. That was good. You know who she sounded like she sounded like

[01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:25.360]
She sounded like the bra what's her name the a big fat? What does she call herself the one from Helen Dale from Lamar?

[01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:28.800]
The one that's always equal here big max that's what that sounded like

[01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:33.300]
Here's hollywood. Hello. Hi Neil. How you doing pretty good? Hey listen

[01:09:33.300 --> 01:09:37.120]
I enjoy the conversation and I was actually introduced to i.o.d

[01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:43.620]
I'm a white male mid 20s. Thank god. Are you a certain size? Yes, I am. Oh, thank the lord

[01:09:44.100 --> 01:09:47.920]
Stop it right there, please getting better by the minute. Okay. I was introduced to i.o.d

[01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:49.580]
Probably five years ago

[01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:53.340]
Because of the buttload bank gadget two to six hour which was

[01:09:53.920 --> 01:09:54.540]
Yeah, I'm on right now

[01:09:55.040 --> 01:09:57.500]
Which was Rick and Sud. He's on right now

[01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:02.780]
Yeah, we got a few fans and we got a few fans that want to hear you

[01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:07.140]
But anyway, definitely I then drifted back into the two out two to six

[01:10:07.140 --> 01:10:10.260]
Sorry, 10 to two and was I was introduced to you. Yeah

[01:10:11.080 --> 01:10:13.120]
The change over that brought Phil Hendrion

[01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:17.440]
I think that was not something that was conducive for Rick and Sud. They're not a morning show

[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:22.520]
And that's not anything against you Rick. It just happens to be that it's a it's a wrong time

[01:10:23.460 --> 01:10:28.440]
I've said that over and over right. I mean it's just not there's not a lot not a lot of continuity and

[01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:31.680]
Unfortunately, that's just you know, it's not a conducive show to that

[01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:35.200]
You excited about going to mornings though and if in the initial stages

[01:10:35.960 --> 01:10:37.420]
As it was presented. Yeah

[01:10:38.140 --> 01:10:42.140]
But he wouldn't have to do any show prep and no as a matter of fact

[01:10:42.140 --> 01:10:47.900]
It was there was a real long back and forth in fact that whole thing was boy gary and the lawsuit and all

[01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:55.020]
Another crab it was yeah, I wouldn't know and then and then gary Bruce left. Yeah, that was right the one the decision was made right

[01:10:55.020 --> 01:10:58.580]
He left and left us here and we just kind of fended for ourselves

[01:10:58.580 --> 01:11:05.400]
There was no program director. There was no promotion. There was we initiated a morning show with nobody helping out and no matter

[01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:06.200]
No nothing

[01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:10.580]
Neil. Well Chuck was there. Yeah, don't worry about the Chuck Meyer thing

[01:11:10.580 --> 01:11:15.940]
I think he was not really too good as a character and I didn't think he added anything to Rick's show

[01:11:15.940 --> 01:11:22.780]
I'm so glad that before he leaves somebody called and you know verified what I said before Chuck said you know great news guys a good guy

[01:11:22.780 --> 01:11:26.820]
But for some reason you got to fetish. I mean, I think Rick is in the fat guys or something

[01:11:26.820 --> 01:11:32.320]
I remember I think he filled in for you at one time you were not for a week. Neil right it was terrible

[01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:35.740]
I actually called to talk with him and he wouldn't let me get in a word edge wise

[01:11:35.740 --> 01:11:39.560]
Yeah, and it was just kind of difficult to imagine him having his own show

[01:11:39.560 --> 01:11:41.500]
But those hot newsmaker interviews man

[01:11:41.960 --> 01:11:44.880]
That's where it's at have a great day pal. Hey back to your reneering. Okay

[01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:50.680]
Yeah, let's bring back the monkey in the morning. Well, he's I don't know they just say stuff back at your reneering

[01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:54.800]
Yeah, who's listening right now about boy, but you they're foaming into mouth Henry and Roger

[01:11:54.800 --> 01:11:59.500]
How you doing guys and reneering they listen to every day, but especially now can you imagine no? I got to go

[01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:04.320]
I know that thank for having a break if we could take the break but it was very special time

[01:12:04.880 --> 01:12:08.160]
Well, I'm glad that we had so many compliments and so many good comments

[01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:13.460]
What was the confidence of this because Jennifer was upset so Neil brought you Neil said come in sit down

[01:12:13.460 --> 01:12:17.940]
And I said I don't want to get into this he said sit down you all actually was pretty quiet

[01:12:17.940 --> 01:12:20.500]
It was like deadly, and I thought well, let's start it up today

[01:12:20.500 --> 01:12:24.220]
You know, I thought I'm a toddler. We're gonna start up and let's kill some good time and we're doing it

[01:12:24.220 --> 01:12:28.400]
He had quite a sharp edge on it and so we went with it. Okay. Don't no accident's other way home now

I don't want to sit here and make a fool out of myself and that's it

[01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:41.940]
That was a cintillating couple of hours. I'll tell you that in fact

[01:14:41.940 --> 01:14:44.600]
We could probably make a format out of that and get a 45-share

[01:14:45.260 --> 01:14:46.580]
Here's a bokeh hello

[01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:50.160]
Yeah, Neil yes, sir. I think we should get rid of Rick and such yeah

[01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:54.400]
I think the show blows and I think when they go to the afternoon we're gonna bring back

[01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:58.420]
Wait a minute wait a minute hang out a second. Do you think Rick's in his car yet? Oh, he is okay. Go ahead

[01:14:58.420 --> 01:15:04.600]
Hi, I hope he goes off the bridge. Yeah, bring back Alex Bennett. Okay. I like the cardboard audience

[01:15:05.060 --> 01:15:08.920]
Yeah, that was good exactly and remember Hank hates you. Okay

[01:15:10.260 --> 01:15:14.620]
Here's Tamarack. Well, at least he said something different at time Tamarack. Hello. Hey, I think that guy with an asshole

[01:15:14.620 --> 01:15:17.900]
Okay, Rick and Suzard are gonna be great going back to the afternoon

[01:15:17.900 --> 01:15:22.700]
You know, they were right in the mornings, but the afternoon you know I really do agree that they're in afternoon

[01:15:22.700 --> 01:15:27.500]
After that they were comfortable and it's a lower slower pace and it's a different ballgame

[01:15:27.500 --> 01:15:29.580]
I think it's gonna be fine. Oh, for sure

[01:15:30.780 --> 01:15:34.180]
They're bored of Adam. Yeah, I don't like him very much

[01:15:34.180 --> 01:15:40.340]
Okay, what's the start with Adam? Why do we hate him? Let's pick on him some can I say the other word for went

[01:15:41.420 --> 01:15:45.320]
What pussy yeah, yeah, I'm the pussy. Yeah, I thought I'm a one of their

[01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:45.320]

[01:15:46.780 --> 01:15:51.780]
The thing that they had to do with the airport one of their tragic tripping yeah, and I just don't like me roasting the runway

[01:15:51.780 --> 01:15:53.940]
Not that I had rubbed you the wrong way

[01:15:54.520 --> 01:15:58.100]
um 21 years old and I'm certain size all right, and uh

[01:15:58.100 --> 01:15:59.020]
What else?

[01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:04.440]
Too bad feels leaving here's the guy who's 21 years old circumcised and was rubbed the wrong way by a pussy

[01:16:05.640 --> 01:16:08.920]
Yeah, uh, you know, Phil is Phil is one of the big

[01:16:09.480 --> 01:16:11.100]
That's like a good thing. He's going to California

[01:16:11.100 --> 01:16:17.660]
To a much bigger market to a much bigger radio station and gonna make more money and uh and deservedly so you know

[01:16:17.660 --> 01:16:19.940]
Exactly he deserved it, so we ought to be happy for him

[01:16:19.940 --> 01:16:22.900]
However, however, I do want to say this and I did say it while he was here

[01:16:22.900 --> 01:16:24.800]
So I'm not saying anything just because he walked out of the room

[01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:30.520]
But his the obsession that he's got with with trying to convince me to go someplace else

[01:16:30.520 --> 01:16:32.900]
I mean, you know, it's been trying to convince you huh?

[01:16:33.420 --> 01:16:38.080]
Every day for like the last four months including on the year today both oh and

[01:16:38.660 --> 01:16:42.960]
You know, maybe he's doing it because he feels that it's in my best interest or he you know, whatever it is

[01:16:42.960 --> 01:16:48.220]
I don't know why I just have a feeling there that when you're leaving someplace you like to see it kind of disintegrate, you know

[01:16:48.220 --> 01:16:54.080]
Kind of burning your bridges and right exactly and uh, I'm you know in November

[01:16:54.080 --> 01:16:58.140]
I'm gonna be 54 years old or I just I just can't and no, it's not great. It's disgusting

[01:16:58.140 --> 01:17:00.920]
And I can't envision after 20 years here

[01:17:00.920 --> 01:17:06.260]
Just picking up like Marco Polo and just starting all over again someplace. Oh, what's the point exactly?

[01:17:06.260 --> 01:17:09.180]
What's the point? I'm looking toward the end not toward the beginning

[01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:12.820]
Your old shoe comparison was good, you know, yeah, I'm a comfortable

[01:17:13.260 --> 01:17:18.420]
You're gonna be there next year tomorrow and you can do your gardening and to go out and get laid or something

[01:17:18.420 --> 01:17:22.580]
The meantime it's just buzzing in the background and I'm that's it exactly. There you go

[01:17:22.580 --> 01:17:24.700]
Neil have a good one and back to you

[01:17:25.620 --> 01:17:29.940]

You know when cap cities owned that radio station, which I don't want to say which one it is but uh, well

[01:17:41.660 --> 01:17:45.380]
I'm telling you the number of overtures I had from them and the only thing is cap cities

[01:17:45.380 --> 01:17:48.760]
He's very nervous very nervous. They don't want to put anybody we need controversial on there

[01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:54.160]
They're kind of like vanilla like butterscotch pudding, you know and as a result they just uh, he's great

[01:17:54.160 --> 01:17:57.620]
He's the best and we really want you but well, I don't need really have to say crap

[01:17:57.620 --> 01:18:01.100]
And you're not gonna say asshole are you and you're sure as I'm not gonna say penis on here

[01:18:01.920 --> 01:18:03.720]
Here's a mobile in Naples hello

[01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:09.980]
Hello, yes sir. Neil yes, I um, I started listening to your show when they were carrying you on

[01:18:10.460 --> 01:18:11.420]
WCN over here

[01:18:11.420 --> 01:18:15.740]

But I catch a little bit of them I get as much of your show as I can every day right and a good bit of fill

[01:18:27.680 --> 01:18:29.740]
I'm a 60 year old white male

[01:18:29.740 --> 01:18:34.440]
I think that your show is great most of the time until you get too pissed off

[01:18:34.440 --> 01:18:35.140]
um

[01:18:35.140 --> 01:18:42.060]

[01:18:48.200 --> 01:18:49.760]
Oh, you wouldn't let him listen to this show though?

[01:18:50.060 --> 01:18:53.580]
I well, he's not out where he's not out of school when you're on oh, thank god

[01:18:54.140 --> 01:18:59.720]
Yeah, I probably wouldn't let him listen to it anyway. No, but uh, um, I think I think you guys do it

[01:18:59.740 --> 01:19:03.480]
A good job. We have no talk radio over here to mount anything we can get

But I'm not going anywhere. Oh, that's the greatest piece of news. I heard all that one less the price is right

Okay, thanks a lot pal. Thank you. And Rick. Thanks you too

[01:20:17.780 --> 01:20:19.600]
Okay, so rick is gonna have a really good in fact

[01:20:19.600 --> 01:20:24.000]
He'll probably get home in about a half an hour. He'll be really flooring that baby on a way up the Hershey highway

[01:20:24.420 --> 01:20:30.640]
They just uh, you know, don't take it personally Rick, but they just don't like you that so I mean even the ones that like the show don't like you personally

[01:20:30.640 --> 01:20:33.740]
But who cares about that they hate me like poison and look what I'm doing

[01:20:34.820 --> 01:20:44.000]

This is a bad down. Yeah, you know something you're the best call we've had all day you're right

[01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:09.900]
This is a great radio station. We got a bunch of deadheads out there and you know, it's it's just not as much fun

[01:21:10.260 --> 01:21:12.740]
It's like it's like sex, you know, when there's somebody else involved

[01:21:12.740 --> 01:21:16.100]
It's always a lot more enjoyable or at least usually than when you're doing it by yourself

[01:21:16.100 --> 01:21:20.260]
And it's the same thing with these shows, you know when we've got an interactive audience sets

[01:21:20.260 --> 01:21:24.140]
You know no matter what it is they got something to say whether it's serious or joking or

[01:21:24.140 --> 01:21:30.200]
Jacking around or whatever they're doing, but this is such a deadhead place. It's just impossible. We choking him in

[01:21:30.200 --> 01:21:33.320]
Miss Yacht with the here right side of the town and everybody

[01:21:33.860 --> 01:21:38.580]
There's very difficult to laugh in day county. Yeah, you're right in the meantime, you know, you can

[01:21:38.580 --> 01:21:45.100]
There's something oh there's something odious about day counting. Yeah, I read to peace by yeah, right screw him

[01:21:45.100 --> 01:21:49.380]
The trouble is that is they want option. They can listen to radio gaborkian

Nice to cut your your your your your paint when you listen to that really

We started out deadly today. It was gonna be another one of those real yawners another ponderous day and other begging and plating and

[01:22:28.420 --> 01:22:32.120]
Just when I saw the opening there, you know, I've been feeling this in my bone

[01:22:32.540 --> 01:22:38.740]
Since I came back from vacation. You just knew that it was you could just anticipate it was bound to happen sooner or later

[01:22:38.740 --> 01:22:44.080]
And I decided why did hell not sooner and as soon as we had the gigantic opening we just jumped right into it

[01:22:44.080 --> 01:22:46.220]
Right are you sure positive

[01:22:47.200 --> 01:22:52.800]

Dolphins all right turn down the TV you checked out

Time capsule for the Smithsonian Institute. This has been it. Magnum mistake about it

[01:23:23.120 --> 01:23:26.300]
Here's dear field beach. Hello. Should have done that a long time ago. Right

[01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:30.580]
That's great ratings. I'm glad that you're staying where you aren't here. I agree with you

[01:23:30.580 --> 01:23:33.020]
You're at this far along the mouse will hang out another

[01:23:33.600 --> 01:23:38.620]
Six years till you hang on another four or five years and retire and uh, I have to take the IRA and

[01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:44.440]
Get a casino right anyway, uh, you uh, you like Johnny Dolan?

[01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:49.340]
Do I like Johnny Dolan? Yeah, I always hear you're ripping him and I had a little story for you

[01:23:49.340 --> 01:23:53.540]
Do I like him? You'd that's something though. Let me ask you this. Do you like terminal cancer?

[01:23:54.480 --> 01:23:56.760]
No, okay. Okay. Well, here's my story. Yeah

[01:23:57.380 --> 01:24:01.160]
This is teacher X-Board-Opple used to work at wins, right? You know, you were the fortune one

[01:24:01.160 --> 01:24:05.140]
You used to have the gate pass but all the other shleppers used to have to ask for permission to come in yeah

[01:24:05.140 --> 01:24:10.100]
I used to piss that SOB off because I would pretend I didn't hear him at the gate like three or four in the morning

[01:24:10.100 --> 01:24:12.540]
I keep him out there like for a half an hour or so

[01:24:13.300 --> 01:24:17.060]
He'd come running and what the hell is wrong with you? God damn it. I act like

[01:24:17.060 --> 01:24:20.600]
I don't know what you're doing. Yeah, like he owned the joint. Yeah, he thought he was uh, you know

[01:24:20.600 --> 01:24:25.640]
Joey Dolan. I know you fun. Yeah, he's a happy capper with all those nuts at his cheeks, right? He's the

[01:24:25.640 --> 01:24:32.720]
Happy chipmunk of the coast so for the last ten years. I've kept that little secret that uh, he's he's sat out there for 45 him and last

[01:24:32.720 --> 01:24:38.740]
I used to let hang out there for half an hour an hour. You know, I'm discovering you know that slogan nobody doesn't like syruly

[01:24:38.740 --> 01:24:44.400]
I'm discovering that nobody likes Johnny Dolan. Well, what is it on the weekends? My why I work my boss puts that

[01:24:44.960 --> 01:24:51.880]
Coast music on and I hear him happy weekend. What is that? That's the coast man

[01:24:51.880 --> 01:24:55.060]
That's Johnny. He's coasted it through a real happy life

[01:24:55.060 --> 01:24:58.980]
Anyway, I'm glad I'm sorry that Phil is leaving. I think he's

[01:24:59.420 --> 01:25:03.860]
This you know, we don't know what we have to. He's gone, but that's right. He's the best man. He's the best in the world

[01:25:03.860 --> 01:25:08.480]
Maybe we could pick him up on satellite somewhere. There you go. Love you. Show me. Okay, Pete. Bye. Get out of here

[01:25:09.740 --> 01:25:11.400]
Okay, here's uh, Margate. Hello

[01:25:11.400 --> 01:25:16.120]
Two quick comments for you. Yes, sir. I was listening to your show yesterday. I got really depressed about my foreskin

[01:25:16.120 --> 01:25:20.260]
So I took my cigar cutter and snipped it right off nice and uh

[01:25:21.800 --> 01:25:26.560]
And uh, Rick and suds. I've never listened to him before except for that one day when they had danger boy on

[01:25:26.560 --> 01:25:30.460]
On the golden uh, on the Passover over there. Yeah, on Passover. Yeah

[01:25:31.340 --> 01:25:33.760]
And they held me up by pouring the ants on his pants

[01:25:33.760 --> 01:25:38.680]
Mm-hmm, and uh, that was the only time and now I really hate the hell out of those long pictures

[01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:44.600]
Ha ha ha ha really? Yes, sir. Okay. All righty. You hear that Ricky. Hate you like poison. Hey

[01:25:44.600 --> 01:25:47.440]
But drive drive careful. Okay pal. Yeah, have a great day

[01:25:47.940 --> 01:25:52.920]
Yeah, it's just a thing Rick doesn't seem to understand of course. He's mellowed a lot since those well not a lot a little bit

[01:25:52.920 --> 01:25:55.980]
Not at all. Yeah, I know he has mellowed a little bit a years ago

[01:25:55.980 --> 01:25:59.720]
They really hated him like poison in fact. I think I might have not never hated him

[01:25:59.720 --> 01:26:04.920]
But I think I just um he was kind of a hard-ass remember those days when he was like really obnoxious now

[01:26:04.920 --> 01:26:06.980]
He's kind of uh, I don't know. He's lost the edge

[01:26:06.980 --> 01:26:13.300]
I think maybe if he goes back to being even more of a hard-ass and starts ripping into uh, Adam all the time and just uh, you know

[01:26:13.700 --> 01:26:18.140]
Did I'm saying? I think that might do the job for him creating kind of a new image or bring back the old one

[01:26:18.940 --> 01:26:21.500]
What they hate him enough. Here's Miami Beach. Hello

[01:26:22.600 --> 01:26:27.560]
Yeah, I'm new. Yes, sir. Yeah, no, I just want to say that Rick and Sus are pretty good. I mean

[01:26:28.140 --> 01:26:33.940]
You know, they have their days up and down. You know, everybody does like a 95-year-old uh, you know

[01:26:33.940 --> 01:26:38.640]
Somebody in a nursing home. Yeah, they have days not too often but once in a while to have a good day

[01:26:38.640 --> 01:26:41.240]
I started to listen to you guys because I we're gonna back in my career

[01:26:41.240 --> 01:26:46.280]
Yeah, and they only have eight a.m. Under radio in the cars. Yeah, so unfortunately I got stuck with that

[01:26:46.280 --> 01:26:50.560]
But then I started to listen to you guys and see another another one of these accidents where you got

[01:26:50.560 --> 01:26:55.560]
You just lucked into it. Are we lucked into you? Yeah, but it's pretty good. I'm impressed with you and Phil too

[01:26:55.560 --> 01:27:00.400]
And Rick says okay, you know, but I was good with you guys. Okay, but every you know, we'll go along with that

[01:27:00.740 --> 01:27:02.280]
Okay, you guys have a good one. Thanks pal

[01:27:02.280 --> 01:27:06.820]
Okay, so we says that Phil and I are great in Rick and Sus. They're okay

[01:27:06.820 --> 01:27:12.140]
I mean, you know, they're an acquired taste and once uh, I don't know what Rick is so defensive and psychotic about once

[01:27:12.140 --> 01:27:15.980]
They get back on there in the afternoon everything's gonna be fine and uh, I will though

[01:27:15.980 --> 01:27:20.500]
I'm gonna live up to my word as I try to do the thing about the ratings since I'm the ratings maven and keep

[01:27:20.940 --> 01:27:28.520]
See years ago people used to care about that now. They just uh, it's just not the same feeling the same ambiance when the trends come out when a book comes out

[01:27:28.520 --> 01:27:29.840]
It's uh, not the same

[01:27:30.740 --> 01:27:35.940]
But I think that it's gonna be interesting. We'll take the last number that Phil Henry has in the final trend

[01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:42.760]
And when that comes out, that'll be kind of like the standard, you know of whatever number they have to beat and of course if Rick doesn't beat it

[01:27:42.760 --> 01:27:48.620]
Well here's uh, Davie hello. Hey, here's my critique my io d critique. Yes

[01:27:49.200 --> 01:27:52.940]
Rick and Sus, uh, kind of boring a lot of dead air

[01:27:53.500 --> 01:27:59.100]
And kind of awkward seems like there's a lot of times where they're just trying to think of something to say or do that's funny

[01:27:59.100 --> 01:28:06.660]
I think that's an accurate assessment. Yeah, um, you're so you have the uncanny ability to do nothing and be extremely entertaining

[01:28:06.660 --> 01:28:13.600]
Right, I don't know. I take that as a compliment. I come in here every day for four hours and I make something out of nothing and I

[01:28:14.340 --> 01:28:19.080]
You know, I have no intention of changing that. I don't want to come in here with some kind of a pre-fab pre-arranged

[01:28:19.080 --> 01:28:23.520]
I don't want to do that anymore. I want to come in here and spontaneously generate crap

[01:28:23.520 --> 01:28:30.980]
Uh, hey, I'm telling you they take it as a compliment. That's how it's meant. Okay, and we feel the word genius has been bandied about and I can agree more

[01:28:30.980 --> 01:28:33.640]
Yep, I mean, it's electrifying listening to it

[01:28:33.640 --> 01:28:39.420]
But are you still it's frustrating and I'm sure it must have been for him too because you take a look at the the stuff that he's done

[01:28:40.160 --> 01:28:46.700]
And the amount of reaction and response to it and then you look at the ratings and the you know, like he was saying the lack of commercial

[01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:51.220]
Success and it just it just I don't understand it

[01:28:51.220 --> 01:28:53.520]
I don't get it the audience is a blessing in the curse

[01:28:53.520 --> 01:28:59.020]
It's a blessing because it provides fodder for him to do his thing right that blocking and play with the audience right tense

[01:28:59.020 --> 01:29:03.700]
But it's also a curse because people are just like what is he doing? I don't understand, you know

[01:29:03.700 --> 01:29:08.600]
So I think a lot he lost a lot of folks with his edge because it was a very sophisticated comic. Yeah

[01:29:09.140 --> 01:29:11.520]
And this of course being such a sophisticated market

[01:29:13.160 --> 01:29:17.720]
You two don't to George who's an incredible board off. Yes, he is the real type board

[01:29:18.200 --> 01:29:25.300]
Incredible work editing and producing the best of tapes and one final question who does the local tags on the national spot?

[01:29:27.300 --> 01:29:31.100]
They're they're really bad. Okay. I'll tell Kenny you said so

[01:29:31.520 --> 01:29:37.000]
Okay, thank you. Okay, even again a shot for Kenny in there. Here's plantation. Hello. Neil. Yes, sir

[01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:43.780]
Today was your best show ever I agree this is probably the best show in the history of radio. I would say you guys should do that every day until the

[01:29:43.780 --> 01:29:49.540]
Sailtakes over time I agree. I think that everybody also to come in on this show. I'll come in a few minutes early and

[01:29:49.540 --> 01:29:53.600]
We ought to hang around you that went in doubt. We'll hang it out. Yeah, at least for like an hour or so

[01:29:53.600 --> 01:29:55.100]
Okay, it's a deal

[01:29:55.660 --> 01:29:58.380]
Okay, so there's the deal Rick's gonna hang around till two every day

[01:29:58.380 --> 01:30:02.380]
Phil's gonna come in around noon 1230. We're gonna sit around and do this every day and when it out

[01:30:02.880 --> 01:30:04.180]
Blow it out shoot it out

[01:30:05.080 --> 01:30:09.740]
Right, so I knew it. I felt it was coming and guess what there it was and they loved it

[01:30:09.740 --> 01:30:13.580]
They just people in the building are sitting around people don't even know that this radio station's out here

[01:30:13.580 --> 01:30:16.180]
They're running out there changing to put an IOD on a marquee for what?

[01:30:16.820 --> 01:30:21.840]
According to broadcasting and bankruptcy expert Larry King you're listening to the worst talk radio in America

[01:30:21.840 --> 01:30:26.340]
