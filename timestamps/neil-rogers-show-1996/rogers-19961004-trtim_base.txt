[00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.500]
It's Friday you best good

[00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.500]
She's back she's back and she's mad

[00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.700]
Barbara Bush she and her posse are tracking down the world's biggest bad guy

[00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.080]
So bad we get a dude to that get a belly side one there once we catch him well

[00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.840]
First I figure out teach that main g-varm and to read and then I'll string him up

[00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.360]
She's judge and juric in her own kangaroo court

[00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.140]
It's hang him high starring Barbara Bush and Clint Eastwood

[00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.380]
It looks like he's high tailed it towards the east slim

[00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.760]
Yeah, you and Debbie ride on the head and cut him off at literacy pass

[00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.840]
Oh

[00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:46.400]
Sane can run but he can't huh. He's got a date with a tall camel and a short roll

[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.880]
In hang on the high high-hole

[00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.440]
What are you trying to say to it? So anyway, it's 1003 at W I O D happy Friday morning boy

[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.380]
Did we have an uplifting experience yesterday?

[00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:04.880]
Oh wow

[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:11.380]
Got the tour of the new W I O D studios up there in Hollywood. I'm gonna tell you something you could eat off the floor

[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.820]
You have never seen anything so majestic so state of the art so phenomenal

[00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.880]
You've never seen anybody especially after what we've gone through last three four years

[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.920]
I mean we can't even get a paperclip in this joint

[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.040]
These people have spent millions of dollars and it's and it's only the beginning

[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.380]
To give us state of the art we're gonna be able to do stuff up there that you wouldn't even believe

[00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.980]
But anyway before we get to that we got great hockey section in the USA today by the way

[00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.420]
Even if you're not one of those regular people it likes the color pictures

[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:46.220]
USA today has got a bonus pull-out section today on the hockey season which begins tonight of course and

[00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.660]
It's great. I mean it has got more crap in here

[00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:55.920]
It also says may believe Sergei Berrazen leads talented rookie core. That's the only thing we got

[00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.300]
He scores a hundred and fifty goals this year. Liefs might have a chance

[00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.460]
But it's got all this great stuff on here

[00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:05.060]
It's got about the different teams about the dynasties are hard to build

[00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.100]
It's got all the rosters of every team

[00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:12.740]
It's got a synopsis on each team who they pick who they don't panthers by the way they pick looks to me like they're picking us

[00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.660]
Third behind the flyers and the Rangers in our division

[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.780]
Which at least is better than that hockey show the United where they picked us forth all of it has a few cost of comments

[00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.280]
And nobody believed in this last year

[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:28.880]
So why should they believe us this year? And then it's got the team by team schedules on the last inside page for all the teams in league

[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.740]
So if you're a hockey fan even if you don't have TCI

[00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:34.780]
This is definitely something you ought to get USA today today

[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.020]
Also speaking of TCI

[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:43.060]
While I was up there in Hollywood with our people people's your tells me the good news the first complaint already

[00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.440]
We haven't even moved in the new building yet. They already got a phone call yesterday

[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.820]
Guess who from TCI? Oh

[00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.960]
They're upset poor babies. They're upset

[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.900]
They're upset because I got in a year and I gave that phone number out in their internal memo

[00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.520]
It says that what's your name there? She wants to hear from the customers and she haven't only got 10 million calls

[00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.540]
And he's a little upset. He's going on here saying this and saying that and that to call us

[00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:08.780]
Yeah, we want people to call you because now it's Friday the opening game is tomorrow night and you people are still

[00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.080]
Dittling around and are trying to put off the public and people are getting picked off

[00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.680]
So anyway Jeff rumor is here this morning

[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.580]
And you can ask him whatever you want right?

[00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:24.500]
Absolutely to Panthers begin this season tomorrow night. We're heading off to Philadelphia this afternoon and

[00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.480]
We may get an update before we leave the air today with regards to direct TV

[00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.380]
Yeah, and the hope is that

[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:36.960]
Vitamin or night and doesn't look like TCI will be on board. No, hopefully they will not be on board

[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.340]
Vitamin or night. So it'll probably be a mad rush to brandsmart and all the other spots

[00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:47.040]
Don't forget this and that is all the way to see there are a lot of people who have direct TV

[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.320]
Who may not be real big sports fans?

[00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.920]
So they only have the basic package?

[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.400]
Yeah, but if they have the basic package and they find out that if they get the sports package

[00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.340]
They're going to get the sports channel Florida on there

[00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:02.580]
They'll be on a phone with direct TV like immediately if not sooner of course they can do that right over the phone as we speak

[00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:07.220]
Negotiations continue from what I understand between East Coast and the West Coast and the hope is that there's nothing

[00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:11.460]
If you don't yeah, why do you keep playing that in the background? You're just because rumors here?

[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.020]
So anyway, we got Jim Leland is coming to manage the Marlin

[00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.680]
Great great great got the umpires walk it out

[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.860]
More trouble with baseball which they just keep shooting themselves in the leg and

[00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:25.680]
The beat of dog McLean here in the next we're gonna talk to Doug McLean

[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:30.000]
I got a great suggestion on something he might shop for you up in Philadelphia. I know they don't have any here

[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.400]
Well, we should also probably call it Don Cherry. We might call it Don Cherry

[00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:38.660]
We might feel some good time so Rimmer can avoid the obvious and can evade growing up and being a man

[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.880]
One thing I would warn you on this show at any given moment here in the first part of the show today

[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:47.540]
Beware of exploding balls, but don't worry about it too much. That's my suggestion

[00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:49.920]
Okay, that even Jennifer knew she knew what was going on

[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:52.780]
Well, this man is cut. Let me just I don't want to ally by for you

[00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:56.660]
But you're cut between a rock and a hard place is what you said which is a good excuse

[00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:01.260]
For the fact that you're just holding out the man hopes here someday he gets a job

[00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:05.780]
He hopes that somebody hires him besides sports Channel Florida. He's only gonna be busy doing a

[00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:11.160]
65 hockey games probably on the baseball telecast doing pregame and postgame and all kinds of other stuff

[00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:18.260]
He's gonna be working 13 months out of there, but he's just holding out that hope that the phone is gonna ring and who do you think is gonna be on the other end?

[00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:19.500]
Maybe it'll be Hank

[00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:26.340]
Well, just a couple things I will straighten out here. Well, yeah, I will all right here. We go number one

[00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:30.060]
Yes, number one. I mean we don't eat a fanfare number one

[00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:35.300]
I guess Hank and I didn't hear it, but Hank the other day I'm told

[00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:39.540]
That he said I was suing two people at QAM, which is just

[00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:45.860]
Yeah, as you know and I think everybody here in South Florida knew back

[00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:50.100]
Well, I guess it's several months ago now some things were said on the morning show

[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:58.700]
About my son Josh right we're totally inaccurate. There was a young high school soccer player with a name grimer or grimes or something

[00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:00.940]
Right that's stepped on

[00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:06.020]
Some kids head and the whole nine yards and I guess the boys were having some fun

[00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:10.600]
But the one guy in particular which was the guy that I had all my problems with when I was at QAM was

[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.360]
Yosegaki and

[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:16.060]
You know he said well, it's a cheap shot. What do you expect looking at his father is but anyway?

[00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:17.180]
We asked for the

[00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:18.980]
Yosegaki sucks, okay?

[00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:25.200]
Because we never heard that yeah, and if it was anybody else that has a son and all the and again

[00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:27.360]
he's not in the public eye and

[00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:34.980]
No need to even talk about the kid but for that to erroneously be said when everybody knows where we live in Coral Springs

[00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:38.600]
And the Harris is kid in Hollywood stepping on somebody else's head

[00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:40.880]
We just thought that we should listen to the tapes etc

[00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:44.620]
But we listen to him and not to make him out out of a mohill

[00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:50.440]
We just decided to to walk away right or wrong. We decided to walk away. So there was never any

[00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:51.100]
any

[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:56.300]
Well, you know you're not something anybody there right and

[00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:02.320]
Well, hey can say what he wants to say and I'm not gonna get down to his level, but the fact where did this all start?

[00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.020]
Didn't you get along with him when you were over there?

[00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:07.780]
Hank was great to me. He really was

[00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:15.560]
The guy the problem yeah, probably yeah, probably and allegedly I also started a rumor

[00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:21.320]
He says that he was going to New York which I did not start the fact the matter isn't there members of it is if it was yesterday

[00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:27.460]
We were sitting in Ottawa and Ron Colangelo who's now the PR guy for the for the Florida Marlins and

[00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:32.060]
Chris Moore myself and Ray Murray were sitting there having lunch and

[00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:38.700]
It was Chris Moore and Ron Colangelo that we're conversing and telling us what the story was with Hank and

[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:47.380]
The long and short of it is and I know it as true as today that Ray Murray came back to me and apologized because he told his editors

[00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:49.160]
Hey, you better check on this because

[00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:54.120]
There's a story in Ottawa that Hank may be going to New York to WFA. Yeah bottom line and all this

[00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:58.360]
I mean, that's a promotion. I mean Hank working at the best sports radio station in the country

[00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:05.040]
But anyway, Hank felt that it was me that started the rumor and he's been telling people I guess on the air ever since that

[00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:10.380]
Totally he's in accurate. He's used that as an excuse to justify the relentless endless attacks

[00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:16.240]
Against you, but it's interesting because I remember Andy Cald was the one even you didn't tell me that Andy Cald was the one

[00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:21.220]
I don't know where he heard it who came to me and said I hear the Hank's going to the FAN that's the rumor and of course

[00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:26.320]
You know me I always take that stuff and go and go with it because you know, that's just the way we do it here

[00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:30.540]
Well, I talked to Ray Murray. I talked to Ray Murray the Sun set and all I got in kind of his face

[00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:31.000]
I said listen

[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.020]
I said you don't need to be making making problems for me

[00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:36.700]
I mean I work with Hank and Hank was pretty upset the first time we talked about it

[00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:39.500]
But I thought at the end that I'd convinced him

[00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:44.980]
After he actually did a tie-hate against Ron Colangelo on the air that it wasn't me who started the rumor

[00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:47.060]
So is he going to FAN? No

[00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:53.200]
Thanks for signing the car for hello Don. Hey, how are you doing? Okay. Great. I'm always at the hurricane game on Saturday

[00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:56.880]
Yeah, good games. This game is great. You know, we lost it was fact

[00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:00.700]
But I wanted to know if you're going to the fan or not in New York

[00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:06.820]
Now you're not now. There was a report that said that you were going to the fans in New York by the end of the month

[00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:10.140]
I've never talked to the fan in New York and I wouldn't lie to you

[00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:16.100]
I read it on I was he on so well, you know, I'm sorry, but it's not true. I don't care where you heard it

[00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:18.740]
Well, that's what they said. He's doing different

[00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:22.820]
What they said I don't know do you know I mean this is the school for

[00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:24.440]
The radio from

[00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:31.520]
That's taking his BS radio from sign-on to sign-offs and I can't believe how many suckers there are in his town

[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:33.120]
For a signal listening

[00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:39.080]
Last year even near our firing do you remember that even near Roger the as well as you've yes radio

[00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:46.020]
Excuse me last week they said Neil was leaving didn't they yeah, is he leaving? No, but I was a fool. That was

[00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:52.620]
Yeah, right. Yeah, right so we got a little exercised about that and you know

[00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:56.400]
Let me say it again. There were other people who started a rumor Andy Kale pass it along and I ran with it

[00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:00.460]
And I'll be honest with you. I keep hearing those rumors again. I think Hank might be going to FA in in New York

[00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:02.540]
I don't want to be involved

[00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:08.720]
I mean, you know Hank can say what he wants to say, but there is reality and I'm not gonna get down

[00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:14.660]
And dirty with Hank because again, Hank was one of the guys that did go to bat for me while I was at the station

[00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:18.420]
He and Joe rose. Yeah, and quite frankly. He's using the bat in other ways again. Well

[00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:26.420]
What what can I say but I'm not gonna get down to that level, but I don't want those things being used as excuses because they're not when

[00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:28.600]
probably in reality the big reason why

[00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:29.720]
Hakes

[00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:33.780]
Upset with me is probably because I make all these appearances on your show

[00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:39.220]
Yeah, and probably because he doesn't know anything about hockey and this is a good cover up for it is that during the playoffs when there was such an

[00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:44.340]
Intensive amount of interest and people were just dying to hear more information about the panthers and about the playoffs

[00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:48.300]
Is that it put him in a very difficult position and it was only after the playoffs were over

[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:51.520]
Sometime later on that he finally admitted he doesn't know anything about it

[00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:53.560]
So what seemed to me that he would be anxious?

[00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:59.920]
I mean if you want to be on a so-called all-sports station wouldn't you want to have people on who know something about sports that you don't know about

[00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:04.820]
You would think Hank I'm telling you when I used to go in in the afternoon Hank would start laughing

[00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:06.880]
So you know what Rimmer you're a

[00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:11.140]
Refaced with your your breath of fresh air and no he he did go to bat for me

[00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:15.920]
With the powers that be but but that time I was buried by that time I was buried by

[00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:21.740]
Zagaki because I mean you can't believe some of the stuff that went on in that station in my shorts day there and quite frankly

[00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:23.460]
The best time I had there

[00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:28.820]
Yeah, Emma's one of the three weeks that I worked the morning show with Joe Rose and I got on there because Joe said

[00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:34.000]
Hey, listen, I want to work with this guy. I want this guy in the morning show and Joe's the guy and and the fact

[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.860]
The matter is when the lawyers letter went to Q.A.M. and and

[00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:42.440]
Joe got wind of it and Joe talked to me and actually didn't talk to me very much

[00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:44.080]
But you know that he was pretty upset about it

[00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:48.660]
But I said Joe my problem is not with you the problem was that the inaccuracies of of

[00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:52.520]
Zagaki and I think that right from day one we had problems there

[00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:55.180]
I mean I one time co-hosted a show with Joe Zagaki

[00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:59.080]
Yeah, and people in the building were appalled because he was running down the the hall

[00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:01.620]
Couldn't get to the old owners quick enough to

[00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:07.680]
Bitch and complain that I was put on his show without his knowledge. I'm a talkie talk. It was crazy hockey hockey

[00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:12.440]
No, it's also a hockey that's you want to do good sports talk radio and you know that radio is my love

[00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:17.720]
Right next to the floor to Panthers and hockey radios my first love you want to do good sports radio

[00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:24.180]
I worked at one of the great stations in America W.A.L. and Baltimore for 10 years your guest intensive your issue oriented

[00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:28.320]
You get to the people that are making the news last week when this story broke on the on the baseball

[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:32.680]
Empire I knew about it eight hours before about the umpires potentially walking out

[00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:34.980]
I talked to the umpire that was the crew chief there

[00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:36.020]
I thought the way and in fact

[00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:41.340]
It's a complete face kids on who work cheap and scream any Ellen the see how loud things if you want to talk to the crew chief

[00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:45.040]
That that was right there with Alamar we can get them on the phone here in three minutes

[00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:49.720]
Yeah, we got a lot of stuff going on. We got the umpires walking out allegedly. They're in court again this morning

[00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:53.740]
We got Jim Leland coming here, which is a trip and only be ecstatic about that

[00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:57.840]
We got the hockey season starting tomorrow night. We got just all kinds of crap going on

[00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:04.360]
So beware of exploding balls. Okay, we'll get Doug McLean on a couple of minutes to and we'll see what he can add to

[00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:09.980]
The mystery of the story 1015 at W.I.D. Jeff Rimmer the voice of the Panthers on sports channel Florida

[00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:12.580]
Which some of us are gonna be seeing see I don't want to sound selfish

[00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:14.200]
But I don't have any problem because I'm gonna get it

[00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:19.380]
I got the big dish if you folks out there like the big one a nice big cigar and your person of course people would good taste

[00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:22.860]
Everybody once in a while loves to light up and puff on something really great

[00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:26.640]
Mike cigars is the place for it not just a premier cigar store in this town

Dimes stores and drugstores mom and pop cigars stores a lot of places where you can just go and get a cheap cigar

Okay, 10 19 and WIOD here's the man here's Doug McLean

[00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:36.820]
We don't want you to like you know get over shadowed now. We got Pat Riley with a slick here

[00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:41.220]
We got Jim Leland as flying in as we speak from Pittsburgh. We got some big famous names there

[00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:44.040]
We got JJ with even a better here than Pat Riley

[00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:47.140]
Yeah, and you know all you did was go to the Stanley Cup finals

[00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:49.920]
We don't want you to get over shadowed now. Don't worry about that

[00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:53.760]
Now there's some heavy hitters, which is good. You know, it's nice to

[00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:56.120]
Nice to see them all

[00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:59.200]
Come to town, you know exactly and of course, you know

[00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:02.440]
You kind of put the pressure on them because you're the guy that took a team

[00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:07.060]
Nobody thought was even going to make the playoffs to the finals and these guys are making a big big big bucks

[00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:12.460]
And got the big names and they got yet to prove anything at least here. Yeah, they've proven quite a bit Nielo

[00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:15.140]
I mean really they it's like you and radio. I mean yeah

[00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:17.640]
Yeah, it's not kid herself. Oh, you're putting those guys in my class

[00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:21.320]
Well, I thought you were my friend. Well, they're in your money class. Yeah, just

[00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:27.180]
What river tells me almost now listen before we talk a little bit about this weekend you guys are going up to Philly

[00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:32.400]
You're leaving us after knowing I know that Eric Lindross always talked about a place that's a favorite of mine in the Philly area

[00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:37.960]
Wow, which is like a big it's like a big seven 11, but they got great sub sandwiches. Oh, yeah

[00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:41.020]
You ever hear a wild was no when you're up there? You want to get the guys over the world?

[00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:42.700]
You go to Rockies have you ever heard of that?

[00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:46.660]
You get about that. Wow was has got the best sub sandwiches. I'm wondering maybe some of you

[00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:50.680]
Maybe Rimmer's gonna buy dinner there tonight. He sounds like the type of place he'd buy dinner up there in Philadelphia

[00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:54.020]
Maybe you might find some like paste on balls for this guy

[00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:59.960]
I'm not not like permanent ones, but maybe you might find like a little small pair to start with because I know he can't find any down here

[00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:04.500]
Who is it for who for Rimmer? Oh really? Yeah, I'm not gonna get into that

[00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:05.620]
Yeah

[00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:12.720]
Yeah, so how do we look is anybody other than Shepherd? We got everybody healthy now everybody everybody looks good

[00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:17.680]
I you know, I think it's gonna be a tough weekend to say the least but now what is that what does that mean?

[00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:20.600]
Well, you know the home opener is always make it a little more interesting

[00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:25.960]
I'm hoping they're gonna be a little bit more uptight than we are because it's their home opener, but I think both teams are

[00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:32.380]
You know, I think Philadelphia and particular are gonna be a little what's that word you used before off?

[00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:32.980]
Yeah

[00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:37.300]
Because you know bus beat them out last year. I think it gives them a little more incentive

[00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:44.240]
But and is Lindross not playing I heard he's not yeah, you know, that's the word, but I mean TSN reported that to the day

[00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:48.520]
Somebody's telling me maybe oh 10 days, but I don't know, but it'll be a tough game

[00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:53.220]
I like our lineup. We've got some a little bit of a different look with Smith in there up front

[00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:59.940]
I've got Devorak playing with Lowry and Burns, which is kind of an interesting line in place of Ray and then I've got

[00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:01.440]
Lindsay

[00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:06.140]
Stracca and Smith which should be a little different look as well, you know, yeah

[00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:12.580]
So I kind of like the look of our team right now, and I think it's gonna be a little tougher year because the teams are gonna be everybody says

[00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:16.740]
They're gonna be gone and forced a little more. I found they gun first pretty good last year, but anyway, it'll be fun

[00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:19.520]
Team's not getting the respect in the media. Who's this George?

[00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:26.580]
Team's not getting the respect in the media everybody's got their preseason forecast and Doug to be honest with you

[00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:33.480]
The Panthers aren't anywhere near the top everybody's expecting other teams in this conference and particularly in this Atlantic division to finish ahead of Florida

[00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:35.580]
Well, I think that's

[00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:43.040]
Lots of people are saying that and I don't know why they wouldn't give us a little bit better looking at but really the who cares

[00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:48.960]
I mean we just have to go and play that's what we have to do and most teams in the league know that will be a tough team to play against

[00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:52.040]
You know, so that's the bottom line. We'll play hard and we'll

[00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:54.980]
You know, we I just have to hope that the kids come along

[00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:55.640]
You know the

[00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:59.700]
Warner's and Jovenoskies and even need a Myers got to be a little better this year

[00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:04.780]
And he's got potential that your boy Stracas got to play you know hard every night. Are we gonna?

[00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:09.440]
He'll score over 30. I don't want to let's forget something straight right now if I am to sit him out the odd game

[00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:12.780]
You know don't jump all over me kneel right off the back

[00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:16.740]
You're gonna you're already talking about sitting out Marty Stracan the season hasn't even started yet

[00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:18.180]
Well, I sure hope

[00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:22.700]
The tech is not getting interpreters past that along every time I write a name down

[00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:27.000]
I think you know the worst the egg of age now. I'll just play that's right. Just keep it in that's right now

[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.760]
You're talking as speaking of the meeting now by the way yesterday the fans at the

[00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:35.760]
Outer lunch and we're saying what are you going on with Neil again and talking hockey?

[00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:39.820]
Well, I just I phone them quite regularly for tips and you know, it's the bottom line

[00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:45.580]
Yeah, I figured now that the season's starting that would probably be good time you still own thanks for all that he contributed to you last year

[00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:51.860]
I think don't I mean how many times I have to thank the guy? I think like once a week would be good just just to keep the memory fresh

[00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:58.000]
As speaking to the media and maybe not giving the panthers. They're just do understand there was a story in the New York Times yesterday by Jola point

[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:03.180]
Where he talked about the panthers playing boring hockey and talked about you and being kind of arrogant

[00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:08.540]
No, he didn't say that he said I was thin skinned and cocky. Okay. Well arrogant and cocky pretty good

[00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:15.300]
I don't I mean I I know where at all. I mean last year he wrote a brutal article about us. We all saw that. Oh, yeah, that was ridiculous

[00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:16.180]
So I mean he's just

[00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:22.300]
It's fine. I mean I are you thin skinned up? I'm thin skinned. I don't think I am viewing I am Neil

[00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:28.460]
Not in the least not when you're compared to Rimmer that's one good thing always keep Rimmer around close man

[00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:33.660]
You look like a hard as you keep him around. It's something I've got to improve on. There's no doubt about that

[00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:37.920]
Well, if you quit eating those stale donuts, it's in Horton's making for you up there. You might be ahead of the game

[00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:41.420]
That's right. What about team toughness Doug is this team gonna be tough enough?

[00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:45.520]
Would you get off at Rimmer? I mean you guys talked about that all last year

[00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:49.860]
I mean, that's what you that mean see Neil they jump on one little thing

[00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:51.440]
And they run with it, you know

[00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:56.140]
Well, you know that only wanted you told me you wanted to address that issue

[00:20:56.140 --> 00:21:00.280]
I thought physically we're the toughest team in the playoffs last year in our conference

[00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:04.020]
But we've got Martin. We sent him down to greens where he'll be up and down

[00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:09.120]
I think he'll help Paul we don't want Paul laws fighting that much because he's a he's a too good a player now

[00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:12.360]
I mean Paul's really improved his game, but Paul will still

[00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:17.300]
Do that for us and I think that Martin will be up and down all year to help in that area

[00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:21.220]
I want about your new TV show that debuts tomorrow night at six o'clock on support channel

[00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:29.220]
I heard that I don't know I nailed the juice you haven't heard about have you know? I haven't heard a word about Rimmer's the host

[00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:32.940]
Yeah, and I mean here we are doing the show the other day and I've got to

[00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:37.580]
T try to get him to relax. He was so uptight now. He's supposed to be the TV guy. Yeah

[00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:41.240]
I mean it was well, that's because he knew he had made a commitment to come on here this morning

[00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:44.660]
And he knew he could never live up to all the promises he made so he's been uptight all week

[00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:50.780]
What they dropped the puck he'll be are he'll listen up a little bit and what about that radio show that I heard about that you might be doing

[00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:56.780]
Yeah, do you know anything about that? Yeah, it's just it was just a little bit of a communication problem

[00:21:56.780 --> 00:22:00.560]
But it's all I guess it's all worked out you guess

[00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:04.380]
Yeah, it's gonna be it's gonna be fun. They have a new format going to be

[00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:07.820]
Born it in huh are you gonna phone in on yeah? I will be phoning in on your shows

[00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:10.620]
No matter fact to keep you honest. That's a good idea every week

[00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:16.220]
That's an excellent idea. Is this me? It's gonna be your last appearance on the Neil Rogers show? No way no chance

[00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:19.640]
He wants to talk to somebody knows something about the game. I think it's a good idea

[00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:22.140]
You're really putting me in this spot now let me ask you something

[00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:26.860]
Seriously if you I mean obviously you playing arrangers on Sunday and then we got a

[00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:29.960]
We're playing arrangers more times in a month of October last year

[00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:33.220]
We didn't play him hardly at all till the end of the season and now we're loading up on arrangers in the beginning

[00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:37.400]
I mean how strange is that though? I don't get the schedule at all in fact if you look at the schedule

[00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:41.560]
You know last year everybody complained how bad it was yeah, you look at the schedule and man

[00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:45.240]
There's like the Leafs. I know the Leafs are gonna be in last place all year there's gonna be no pressure

[00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:49.180]
But they got they got one a couple of trips where they go and play San Jose

[00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:54.180]
They come back home then they go back to play Colorado. I mean whoever put this schedule together must have been on drugs

[00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:57.700]
Well, I'll tell you it I guess it's I don't know if the computer did or not

[00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:03.440]
Like what some mazes me is last year we played arrangers five times in the last month at right in this year

[00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:06.100]
We've got them four times in the month of October so it's

[00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:10.740]
It's strange and it's I don't like I'm not overly fussy about it

[00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:14.000]
I don't like the way we start you know because it is a tough schedule

[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:18.220]
We got seven of the first 13 against arrangers and fill in and you throw Colorado and Chicago yeah

[00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:19.820]
But I you know

[00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:23.200]
It's you got to play them so let's get on with it

[00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:24.240]
And what do you think about the Rangers?

[00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:27.940]
I mean there a lot of people who think that they wasted a ton of money on gratsky

[00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:33.080]
There are other people who are picking them to go all the way now because they think Messia can have a big year with gratsky there and they got

[00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:36.200]
You know Richter played so great in the World Cup. Yeah

[00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:43.180]
Richter leech Messia Gratsky Graves Graves yeah, they've got a real good team. I think they're gonna be strong

[00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:44.220]
I really do

[00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:50.140]
Gratsky, you know, we know I mean he's guaranteed a hundred points. I think that's what he'll do in the regular season

[00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:58.340]
And you know, I think I don't I think Wayne will be able to handle playing with Messia a lot better than people think

[00:23:58.340 --> 00:24:03.700]
I think he sort of that I gotta ask you this about gratsky because the Leafs didn't accomplish much in the playoffs last year

[00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:08.800]
But they did they did set a precedent that is they started beating the livin's not out of Wayne who's not used to that

[00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:14.820]
He's used to having guys standing around and watching him admire his passing and skating ability and he started really getting to them

[00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:19.020]
And he can't take it and I think after that they did the same thing the Troids series

[00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:24.860]
If you start hitting Gratsky he becomes a different player. Well, I think it's it's happened to him over the last couple years

[00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:28.280]
And in the playoffs it really picks up because in playoffs it's

[00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:34.400]
It's all business, you know, and we saw that the difference in our team in the playoffs compared to the regular season

[00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:39.020]
It's just it's that extra level, you know, and you do tend to go after people

[00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:43.660]
You just you forget about all the tradition then and yeah, it's you know go for it

[00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:46.060]
I don't know if I'm making any sense in it

[00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:51.200]
Not really I think you're doing what you do the best you know, I'm doing to be quite honest while I was dancing that

[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:52.840]
No, you're skiing I was tying my ski

[00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:57.840]
No, I think what you're doing is what you do best and that's covering all sides covered your butt, which is a good idea

[00:24:58.620 --> 00:25:03.600]
So so so who do you like in the division that we have to uh who you think we can uh the Rangers or the Philadelphia

[00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:05.940]
That we're gonna really have to beat out

[00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:09.100]
Because I'll be honest with you personally. I'll answer my own question first

[00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:14.640]
I think the Flyers had their big chance last year and I think they just didn't have the intensity that they had the previous year

[00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:17.420]
I think this year they might not be as good. She's I hope you're right

[00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:21.840]
I just every time I look at Renburg look at people clarinland I think it nervous at all

[00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:26.580]
You know they they can be such a dominant line that they can bury and that that's the only thing that

[00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:31.680]
That concerns me, you know, I don't know how much Howard chuckle do with the is their second line guy, but

[00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:34.860]
I I looked for Pittsburgh

[00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:38.940]
They're an interesting group too like I just don't know what's gonna happen with them because Hatcher

[00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:42.960]
Now they signed Muni on the blue line. They should be a little better, but I

[00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:43.900]
I don't know

[00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:44.600]
I'm gonna

[00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:48.520]
I'm gonna tell you that's really improved month. You all look like an interesting team. Yeah quite honestly

[00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:50.640]
Mario Tromblay is the coach there

[00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:55.800]
I'm gonna give you a little bit on Pittsburgh even though I don't I know we don't play him to later on but Pittsburgh

[00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:59.740]
Even though they got Kevin Hatcher defensively boy. They're worse than ever

[00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:04.580]
I know that comes with a shock, but defensively they're very suspect and they got a lot of promise

[00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:05.740]
Molinsky is gonna be traded

[00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:11.480]
There's no way he's gonna sign with them. Molinsky's gonna be gone. Ned Vets gonna hold out into the season for at least another couple of weeks

[00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:16.740]
Maybe more than that. So they got some problems there even with Mario. Yeah, I agree. It's gonna be interesting

[00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:21.140]
But I don't know I just I like the look of our team right now

[00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:24.400]
And I think we can compete with anybody. Yeah, so it'll be interesting Jersey now

[00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:27.880]
I see Bob McKenzie and TSN is picking Jersey to win the Stanley Cup. So

[00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:32.300]
How do you know from year to year what's gonna take place? There's Rolnik and end up in New Jersey

[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.260]
What Rolnik? I thought he just could trade the Phoenix

[00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:40.940]
Well, I know he hasn't signed yet either. He's not gonna play for Phoenix. You know that no

[00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:46.300]
I don't I think you will I think you'll play in any roomers force you can leave us before he head to the ice no more Brendan

[00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:49.680]
Shanahan stories now. Oh, I'm not telling it rimmers unbelievable

[00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:55.080]
They tell me he's putting his garbage out the other morning. Mel and he was gone by trying to counter present when he was waving him down

[00:26:56.480 --> 00:27:02.000]
Waving him down. I believe he's got to say hello. I told Mel next time he goes by just kick his garbage cans over

[00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:07.600]
Okay, coach best of luck this weekend. Thanks a lot. Bring back bring back at least

[00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:12.640]
Well, we'll settle for one out of two this weekend and we'll do some real business on Tuesday. Okay, take care guys. Okay

[00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:18.720]
Okay, Doug McLean giving the inside story there instead of some of the other BS we hear it's 10 30 at W.I.O.D

It's going on right now the 45th anniversary sale and it's gonna continue right to the second annual Italian Heritage Festival

[00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:18.280]
It's the big one. It's going on right now as I speak the 45th anniversary sale at Lorenzo's Italian sediment with Miami Beach and

[00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:21.420]
At Bennett Bob's fresh seafood and produce in Weston

[00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:23.500]
Talking entertainment radio

[00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:29.220]
610 W I O D what you're saying 1034 W I D Jeff rumors here

[00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:32.720]
We got the million different things going on. We got the lead on us coming in

[00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:37.100]
Which surprised me because I guess here's one guy who thinks money isn't everything

[00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:42.000]
And he probably took a look at that California angels roster and the dearth of pitching which they have done

[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:46.500]
And he said all the money in the world and all the Disney stock in the world isn't worth going out there and

[00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:49.220]
At this stage of my life and falling on my ass

[00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:52.920]
I mean I got at least in common here. He's coming to a team that even with John bulls

[00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:58.940]
And there were a lot of us including me made jokes about John bulls when he took over and the fact that he looked like he was lost and made a lot of

[00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:00.140]
very bizarre

[00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:05.400]
Decisions and strategy during some early games, but he brought that team along pretty good

[00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:11.720]
They finished only two games under 500 which is a miracle and leadlands basically taken over the nucleus of a team with some potential

[00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:15.520]
I talked to Dave don brosky the other day and and I kind of sit you know this

[00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:21.520]
Setting up an analogy because don brosky was a Montreal although he came to Montreal after I left and went the ball more Washington

[00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:27.220]
But I said to don brosky it was very much to me personally like when bulls

[00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:34.280]
Similar position guy Jim fanning was with the Montreal expose and he came after they fired dick Williams

[00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:39.400]
Came out of the front office to manage the expose and got him to the lead championship series

[00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:40.040]
but

[00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:46.140]
Fanning went back into the front office and they got an everyday manager and he's now scouting for some team and it may in fact

[00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:47.940]
Still be the Montreal expose because he lives in Montreal

[00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:54.480]
But I don't think without a doubt and I think it was Gordon needs who first broke the story in the Sun set

[00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:58.020]
No now eight weeks ago two months ago if you remember he said that

[00:29:58.020 --> 00:30:02.800]
Layland could end up managing the marlins and it was almost like a federal complete and I think that

[00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:05.260]
Eads was onto something then and

[00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:09.220]
Obviously was correct because today's gonna be unveiled as a new manager. It's a great move

[00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:15.160]
I've been around baseball a long time and this guy is without question Harold. It is the premier manager in the game

[00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:17.380]
And then you know they're gonna make some moves

[00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:20.120]
That's a one thing that you got to say whether you like

[00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:25.300]
Erison you like has anger you like any of these guys is that they have opened up the piercet rings down

[00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:31.180]
Especially I think with the marlins I think Wayne's got to realize that unless so they do something dramatic and drastic now

[00:30:31.180 --> 00:30:39.200]
That there's a good opportunity that the any prepared to do it

[00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:43.240]
Each year since that opening year when there was a lot of excitement and a lot of

[00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:46.880]
Interest as though this was something brand new and maybe it was to a lot of people here

[00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:50.400]
But it's not there now. I'm sure that dumbbrowski

[00:30:51.260 --> 00:30:57.140]
Be at the president smiley and hyzing himself of told Layland that he's coming here

[00:30:57.140 --> 00:31:00.300]
And they want to put the pieces of the puzzle together. They've got a great nucleus here

[00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:03.120]
They've got a great one two combination they brought in here last year

[00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:09.140]
Pitching wise they've got Gary chef field and those people that suggest that they've got a trade Gary chef

[00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:11.300]
I mean they couldn't be further from the truth

[00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:14.600]
This guy is the kind of baseball player you build a team around

[00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:19.740]
I think Konheim becomes the first baseman next year they go out and maybe they get banea although banea is now

[00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:21.460]
And my talks to people in Baltimore

[00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:24.500]
Banea is now hinting that he'd like to stay with the orals

[00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:27.500]
So I don't know if if that could happen, but who knows

[00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:31.620]
uh as well and we've heard the stories and I don't know if it's possible to get

[00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:35.740]
Berry bonds here, but boy wouldn't it be great to see bonds here. He's a great ball player

[00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:38.360]
But I don't I think it's pie in the sky. I don't think it's gonna happen

[00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:39.480]
but there are some

[00:31:40.620 --> 00:31:45.840]
free agents out there and obviously the marlins can make some trades because they do have some young players in their farm system

[00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:53.800]
That can make the marlins you read you read the theory bonds don't you think we've reached our uh juck asshole quota our quotient in this town

[00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:56.960]
Already we don't need berry bonds. I mean various trouble wherever he goes

[00:31:56.960 --> 00:32:01.400]
There's no question he's got the ability and chef fields got his own problems, but he's not even the league with berry bond

[00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:06.040]
But if you remember lalan and it's one of the great pieces of video that we've seen on ESPN

[00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:07.580]
over the years

[00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:08.860]
It was at

[00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:10.780]
Serath not serathoda

[00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:20.480]
Raidenton is where the pirate trained right and I guess bonds was moping off to the media and and moping off to some of his teammates and lalan went right in and the cameras were on him

[00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:24.300]
And if you remember he ungressed bonds right there and it became

[00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:32.360]
Some of the folk piece for months after that because on every show you saw lalan telling bonds the way it was and quite frankly

[00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:37.140]
You look at bonds today and he says the guy that he's got the most admiration for as a baseball manager

[00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:41.080]
Is lalan so if anybody can control this guy. It's Jim lalan

[00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:43.320]
Okay, we'll see

[00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:45.420]
Speaking of baseball by the way

[00:32:45.420 --> 00:32:49.700]
I think you and I are probably the only two people in a free world who disagree with all this hysteria

[00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:53.480]
About the alemar incident with the spinning you know last night in the um

[00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:56.520]
In the Dodger Braves game they brought up something very interesting

[00:32:56.520 --> 00:33:03.060]
That is that there was a precedent in 1942 build dicky of the anchkeys got into an incident with the bill summers the

[00:33:03.060 --> 00:33:05.060]
Elita mercenely umpire right real summer and

[00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:11.200]
Got into a shoving match and shoved him and canna saw mountain land this was the commissioner of baseball

[00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:18.100]
Of course anybody who knows baseball history knows that he was he was brought in in the 20s after the blacksock scandal to clean up

[00:33:18.100 --> 00:33:20.340]
Baseball. I mean he was the toughest disciplinarian

[00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:26.780]
He was a no nonsense guy to say the least and yet the suspension he added out to dicky for shoving an umpire was 30 games

[00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:31.220]
Starting during the regular season the following year not during postseason

[00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:36.320]
There is no precedent in baseball to suspend the player during postseason play

[00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:40.220]
Donald fear Donald fear said that very thing any other night on national television

[00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:47.720]
I'd love to get the america Lee crew chief on that work that series and there's no question in my mind that her speck provoke alemar

[00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:49.800]
alemar is not a hothead

[00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:54.340]
Uh, I cover the american league as you know for 10 years and in alemar's years

[00:33:54.340 --> 00:33:58.000]
Obviously they were in Toronto, but this guy is not a hothead

[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:03.400]
And you cannot see her speck because his back is to the camera in any of the views that we've seen on television

[00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:08.740]
But this guy was provoked and as I've said many times before I've seen umpires time and time again

[00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:14.440]
Provoke these players and they're gonna snap. I mean anybody will that you can push him so far and they're gonna go

[00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:18.120]
But alemar is a classy guy and I know it was not a class act

[00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:24.060]
But the guy was provoked and obviously he lost it and what bothers me about you know richie philips coming on to make an estate man

[00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:29.520]
The self-righteous statement last night is that they nobody seems to care about the game itself

[00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:31.560]
In other words, how can they possibly survive?

[00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:35.660]
You know, we had the uh the short and season two years ago

[00:34:35.660 --> 00:34:37.300]
We didn't have any playoffs no world series

[00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:42.260]
We've had all this decrease in fan interest now you finally get to the one time of the year when people like me

[00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:44.620]
Who don't watch all that much baseball during the regular season?

[00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:48.760]
I find myself watching most of these playoff games and certainly gonna watch the world series

[00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:53.880]
So people you know, there's a natural inclination people who don't watch a lot of football during the year watch the super bowl

[00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:59.000]
People don't watch a lot of hockey watch the playoffs and and now in the middle of this the umpires decide well

[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.180]
You know unless we absolutely get our way

[00:35:01.180 --> 00:35:07.460]
We're gonna walk the hell out even though we got a no strike clause in our contract that we finally just signed after walking out for 120 days

[00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:11.320]
We got a no-cruck strike deal and that we're still gonna walk out and you know what's gonna happen

[00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:14.060]
They're gonna be worse for the game. They're gonna be in federal court today, right?

[00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:17.480]
And they'll be a court in junction and the umpires will go back to work today

[00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:22.780]
There no question in my mind that the umpires are not good. Oh for sure. They're gonna have to they're gonna be forced to go back

[00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:25.940]
And they're gonna be in court today in Philadelphia and they'll be

[00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:32.200]
Rule to go back to work same as it was the other day when I talked to a machine the first time and he said that hey

[00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:33.180]
We've got to stand by

[00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:36.860]
her spec and and the umpires as a union a very strong union

[00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:42.860]
But he expected the right from day one had they gone in the initial time before the deal was made for a couple of days

[00:35:42.860 --> 00:35:44.900]
If you remember they made a deal he said that

[00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:48.140]
There's no no question in my mind that we're gonna be forced to go back to work

[00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:51.600]
But at least we're gonna take our stand and that's likely what Richie Phillips is doing right now

[00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:56.000]
And I think if you had a real making a state a real commissioner instead of on ceilig I think you'd see a

[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.480]
Got some problem a guy come in here and say okay, look

[00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:01.920]
There's no there's no way that we can suspend anybody during postseason now

[00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:08.780]
But uh, we'll agree to increase the suspension the 15 games or 20 games or whatever whatever the number might be

[00:36:08.780 --> 00:36:13.300]
The pacify the umpires the fast pacify the public who are up in arms about this and say listen

[00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:16.980]
We're not gonna accept that kind of conduct no matter what inside of it. It's unacceptable

[00:36:16.980 --> 00:36:19.160]
It's grotesque and we're not gonna accept it

[00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:25.720]
Does that crime fit a 20 game suspension? You're not really I don't think so but I'm gonna tell you you talk to the public and you listen

[00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:29.960]
And after after Joe Buck and McCarver went on about this precedent

[00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:35.940]
They then did a complete turnaround to say that what Alamar did was far worse than shoving an umpire

[00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:43.620]
So in other words spitting in somebody's face in the minds of the public today is much worse than actually physically confronting somebody and shoving them or hitting them

[00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:47.060]
I'm sorry. I don't buy that no, I don't buy either you made the analogy the other day

[00:36:47.060 --> 00:36:53.180]
With regards to cold lume you and what he did the draper in the playoffs and he gets two games right two games

[00:36:53.180 --> 00:36:59.160]
He could have ended that player's career to kill them he could have seriously heard them no question gets two games and Alamar

[00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:05.340]
And I'm not saying it's right. It's a classless act, but Alamar gets what five games and this guy gets two games

[00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:07.300]
And he almost killed somebody. Yeah forget it

[00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:11.360]
Okay 1043 a w i d j framer is here today having free lunch

[00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:28.580]
The Panthers kick off their new season tomorrow night. We got just all kinds of crap going on

[00:38:28.580 --> 00:38:33.540]
Here's a mobile and four-loader deal. Hello. Hey Neil. Yes, sir. This is Tom. Hey. I want to

[00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:37.940]
Ask you guys a couple questions and I'm gonna hang up because I'm gonna local line on a mobile

[00:38:37.940 --> 00:38:45.140]
But you touched on a couple of things one being the concept of a players manager versus a

[00:38:45.140 --> 00:38:48.320]
Got like Jimmy Johnson and I'm a Pittsburgher

[00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:54.160]
Yeah, if you have any comments on the difference between let's say a truly era and the Jimmy Johnson era

[00:38:54.160 --> 00:39:01.900]
And then the the last man era and let's hopefully say the Leland era and the second comment I want to ask you guys to

[00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:04.900]
You know comment on is

[00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:12.280]
What do you think about my Steelers and I'm gonna hang up and I appreciate how good Friday guys. Okay pal

[00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:15.400]
Do you think Jimmy Johnson's player don't you?

[00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:17.900]
Think Jimmy Johnson's a player's coach of course not

[00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:22.560]
He's he's a strict disciplinary and we'll put up with no crap

[00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:26.800]
But you know something and then this is sound pretty far afield

[00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:32.860]
But you saw that thing they had on CBC about the history of Toronto and Montreal hockey rivalry right and

[00:39:33.420 --> 00:39:39.880]
They had that segment on punch him like now for those not hockey fans and I don't know if to remember the least last one to Stanley Cup in

[00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:45.820]
1967 68 they won four Stanley cups in the 60s all under punch him like who took a franchise that in late 50s

[00:39:45.820 --> 00:39:48.440]
Was floundering and came in and built a dynasty

[00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:55.280]
In one four Stanley cups every former player from Frank Mahavallich and Carl Brewer and Ron Ellis and everybody else

[00:39:55.280 --> 00:40:00.320]
They head on bitched and belly-icked about the fact that him like was relentless and he worked him too hard

[00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:03.100]
The guys couldn't stand it and they were psychotic, but he was a winner

[00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:08.900]
Right absolutely so because he put the fear of guiding them and obviously Jimmy Johnson and you know

[00:40:08.900 --> 00:40:11.560]
I don't know if you'd want to say that he's not a player's coach

[00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:13.320]
He's a strong disciplinary and for sure

[00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:19.140]
But if you remember all the accolades that came his way when he first took over the dolphins who begged

[00:40:19.140 --> 00:40:25.040]
begged for some discipline one of the big problems with Don Shula in the latter years there that the dolphins were much

[00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:27.740]
Out of control. Yeah, definitely out of control

[00:40:27.740 --> 00:40:33.800]
They needed that discipline then you get a guy like keep buyers you say it's sour grapes or whatever saying that there's a lot of players

[00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:37.760]
That don't like Jimmy Johnson and I mean obviously he's put the fear of God in them

[00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:44.300]
But at the same time he's given them a chance to play and he wants them to practice hard and play hard much like punch him like

[00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:48.580]
I mean that's where I live and I'll give you a more current example in hockey and that's Scotty Bowman

[00:40:48.580 --> 00:40:53.100]
Now you're always telling me Scotty is crazy and scotties you know see now these then whatever you call them

[00:40:53.100 --> 00:40:58.160]
But the fact is the player is most of them hate Scotty Bowman Dino sister really hated them a primo hate some

[00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:03.180]
A lot of those guys can't stand him and again for a lot of the same reasons because he's a hard discipliner

[00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:06.420]
And he works him like crazy. He demands perfection and

[00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:12.520]
And a lot of guys don't want that in the body plate mind game. I he manipulates people. Yeah, but but granted

[00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:16.380]
But the fact is okay. They haven't want to stand the cup in longer than the leaves

[00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:20.280]
But they still have great teams. They won 62 games last year

[00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:22.340]
All kinds of records and they're a winner

[00:41:22.340 --> 00:41:24.820]
mention the penguins the late Bob Johnson

[00:41:24.820 --> 00:41:31.240]
He wants to stand like cup with Pittsburgh Scotty came and inherited the same team to give Scotty the credit or the penguins the credit when they want those back to back cups

[00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:32.900]
So what do you want to say is broken?

[00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:34.300]
Dynasty that

[00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:39.160]
Well Jimmy Johnson sure didn't be in the right place of the right time. He sure didn't inherit that all I noticed

[00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:43.220]
Sheila made that comment to Roy first on the other which I thought was a very

[00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:48.520]
And just a ridiculous comment to make is that he turned over a super a team to Jimmy Johnson

[00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:50.340]
I mean the team that the dolphins have right now

[00:41:50.860 --> 00:41:52.120]
Especially with marino injured

[00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:55.420]
There's no resemblance to the team that was playing for Shula last year

[00:41:55.420 --> 00:41:59.380]
If you remember Jimmy Johnson refers to gov as coach. He said hey, this is gonna be a bit of a building brought

[00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:05.440]
A situation obviously last year and Jimmy Johnson had a different point of view last year

[00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:08.280]
And that might be the only thing I'd like to debate with him

[00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:12.540]
And if you remember when he was on Fox and he doing his weekly columns in the herald and think it was

[00:42:12.540 --> 00:42:15.220]
He said hey the dolphins have got all the tools. They've got

[00:42:15.220 --> 00:42:20.220]
What it takes to win a super bowl and obviously he was kind of hedging his bed at that point put a little pressure on him

[00:42:20.220 --> 00:42:22.020]
He said, well sure sure we do

[00:42:22.020 --> 00:42:26.140]
But the fact of the matter is when he took over he said it's gonna be a bit of a building program here

[00:42:26.140 --> 00:42:31.080]
He got rid of a lot of dead wood. He got rid of players that obviously did not want to practice and

[00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:35.340]
Racing some good young enthusiastic players. You're gonna play it his way. Are you not gonna play?

[00:42:35.660 --> 00:42:40.800]
You're gonna be gone and what do you know about this David? It's beside the fact that Mike Tom's act is marginalized best

[00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:41.500]
I mean

[00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:44.080]
They really made a mistake letting Neil Adonial get away

[00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:49.240]
I liked Neil Adonial. He was at Maryland when we did the Maryland games at BAL and he's a pretty

[00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:51.620]
A competent quarterback now you can say well

[00:42:51.620 --> 00:42:55.720]
He's not doing much for the New York Jets, but that's not a very good football team the New York Jets

[00:42:56.780 --> 00:42:58.780]
Okay, let's do Miami. Hello

[00:43:00.340 --> 00:43:01.440]
Miami. Yes, sir

[00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:10.260]
Hello, yes, I am. Yeah, how you doing? You okay? How are you great? I have a few things I want to say first of all talking on the first topic of sports

[00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:13.520]
I guess I was born down here Miami with the 72

[00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:16.280]
Shula days and

[00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:23.680]
You know, I've been a sports fan down here. First of all number one. I feel sports should be the respect the players should be a respect of

[00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:28.880]
As a healthy sport not, you know as a healthy atmosphere of not taking drugs don't drink

[00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:31.660]
And this is the topic of the Alamoire situation

[00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:36.640]
I feel that you know, there shouldn't be no violence in sports

[00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:40.340]
The people getting the sports especially with the finance that they make

[00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:47.920]
This should be a role model to where this should be like Michael Irvin and very bonds very bond

[00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:51.780]
The Miami University Miami players all over the country Bobby Cox Warren Mone

[00:43:51.780 --> 00:43:58.140]
Right, right and you know then especially with the violence of fighting, but not spitting in in a

[00:43:58.140 --> 00:44:01.740]
Lawrence face. Yeah, not spitting in a person's face that

[00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:05.860]
Doesn't get the right look at the younger people that

[00:44:05.860 --> 00:44:11.320]
Yeah, but what that's why'd like to know what is it in sports that's going on with very few exceptions

[00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:16.060]
Represents a role model the young people. I was talking the other day about Alex Rodriguez with Seattle

[00:44:16.060 --> 00:44:22.280]
I said if young kids want a role model there is somebody they ought to look up to okay? No drugs no problems

[00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:24.200]
No, you know, no public

[00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:29.400]
Hanky-panky that anybody has to know about whatever it is he just goes out there gets the job done

[00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:33.060]
He's a squeaky clean as a wheel and and there's a role model for it

[00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:41.000]
But how many others can you name today? Not not too many. I mean I have so much of like a sub plan because a moment worked on a way to to my office

[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:44.300]
Want to say a few things okay? Well, Marlins have some some role models

[00:44:44.300 --> 00:44:49.200]
And I guess the way that stands out the most is you have Kona. Yeah, but but the problem of Jeff is he's a hell of a ball player

[00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:53.400]
And he's a good guy, but he's boring people find him boring which and I'll give you another guy

[00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:57.640]
He'll put them out with Dale Murphy with the braves who was there had all those great years with the braves

[00:44:57.640 --> 00:45:00.560]
He was a great player. He was squeaky clean. He used to do milk spots

[00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:04.700]
But he was too squeaky clean. He was people considered him boring

[00:45:04.700 --> 00:45:09.580]
Well, what do you want somebody to have an edge? No, I'm not saying I want. I'm just telling you what I feel is the problem

[00:45:09.580 --> 00:45:14.980]
I think these are not the people that the people talk about let's look at our panthers. I mean John van B's brook Rob need a

[00:45:14.980 --> 00:45:20.840]
Myer. I mean Scott Melon B these are our squeaky, but I think players we've already said the different breed right Neil? Yes, sir

[00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:26.800]
Yeah, we're quick though, but I feel that Alamoire should be suspended for the playoffs and

[00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:32.400]
about five five games next year, but yes, somebody did a mistake and he won't do it again. Number two is the coaches

[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:38.320]
Are not the team down here? Okay. Yes, it's great to have Schulis great to have Johnson good luck

[00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:45.720]
Jimmy and everything but and also that we all come together we go to the to the to the games that games are on TV

[00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:52.200]
It's great, but it's that if the money to spend for the players the players are the team not as much as the coaches

[00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:53.860]
Well, I'll agree to a point

[00:45:53.860 --> 00:45:59.700]
I mean obviously people go to games not to see Doug McLean behind the Panther bench or Jim Leyland and the Marlin dugout

[00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:02.640]
But you need the Jimmy Johnson the Leylands

[00:46:03.260 --> 00:46:08.380]
The Pat Riley's and the Doug McLean's because they're proven winners like at this a plan of Johnson's great

[00:46:08.380 --> 00:46:12.740]
No, I don't think we're going anywhere with the heat the Marlins we have a few a few players away

[00:46:12.740 --> 00:46:15.580]
The panthers I wish them luck. I'm not too much of hockey fan

[00:46:15.580 --> 00:46:17.860]
I'm gonna get into it and another thing that we

[00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:20.920]
To make it you know the long story short so I gotta get going

[00:46:20.920 --> 00:46:23.340]
I hope that the whole country comes together politically that

[00:46:24.040 --> 00:46:27.380]
That's not the change of subject but the cemetery in Miami disgusting what they did

[00:46:27.380 --> 00:46:30.720]
I wish I can secure myself out the time 24 hours a day

[00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:35.120]
That's all come together racists goes away and I have to get going thank you Neil. Okay, pal. You're great

[00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:37.600]
Have a great there. Well, you know good sediments

[00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:41.520]
But again pie in the sky the country isn't gonna come together and things like that are gonna stop

[00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:44.340]
And we got a lot of hate mongers and a lot of a little world's not gonna come together

[00:46:44.340 --> 00:46:46.520]
And they're not gonna stop hating each other in the Middle East

[00:46:46.520 --> 00:46:49.300]
But if we lived in a perfect world, hey, it would be great

[00:46:49.300 --> 00:46:53.040]
But he does work in mysterious ways. We have an open-line in date 751

[00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:57.000]
We got a parent-broward 5249463. We got a big parent-broward

[00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:02.580]
Which is more than some people can say 5249463. Here's the south Miami. Hello

[00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:10.500]
Hello. Yes, sir. Yes. I've never called before. I saw a program focused on south Florida this morning about

[00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:14.360]
discrimination in the workplace and the subject was on bilingual

[00:47:14.360 --> 00:47:20.200]
Being bilingual and talking, you know diverse languages. Yeah. My problem is okay

[00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:24.420]
I'm like the average American person. I was born and raised here just like many other people

[00:47:24.420 --> 00:47:28.480]
What does that have to do with what we're talking about? Okay, so what do we call them? Are we talking about sports?

[00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:32.880]
So can we just talk about anything in general? No, we're talking about sports. I'm sorry

[00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:37.380]
We got a guest here who is not bilingual all we know is a few frogs, but uh have a great day pal

[00:47:37.380 --> 00:47:41.080]
What was that? What the hell was that all about that wasn't the run and wrong listener?

[00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:46.220]
God are we moving up in the world? We have an open line in dayed 7519463

[00:47:46.220 --> 00:47:48.160]
Jeff uh, a remar from Quebec

[00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:54.260]
A frog well, we might as well. Tony speak French. Oh, there was a pro-trono story last time. I was up in Toronto

[00:47:54.260 --> 00:47:58.260]
There was a story in the Sun about a deli a kosher deli in Montreal

[00:47:59.120 --> 00:48:03.320]
Which has primarily obviously a Jewish clientele, but others as well and

[00:48:03.320 --> 00:48:07.820]
They have that thing about the signs about the bilingual signs right the province of Quebec

[00:48:07.820 --> 00:48:11.240]
And it come to fight out this deli which has been there for like two generations

[00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:17.500]
You know 50 years whatever and the signs in English as opposed to the French were too big bigger than the law

[00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:20.020]
allow as permits and so some of the

[00:48:20.700 --> 00:48:26.620]
Politicians there made a big stink about it and they forced them to like make the English part of the signs smaller and

[00:48:26.620 --> 00:48:33.300]
And now the English speaking people there are all bent out of shape because they think that they're caving in and they got this whole big

[00:48:33.300 --> 00:48:36.860]
Just over this one poor guy running a delicatessen because the a French and a

[00:48:36.860 --> 00:48:42.600]
Angle file so called up there hate each other so how the language laws but a problem in Montreal since the early 70s

[00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:48.360]
I moved there in 1977 and they had the first referendum shortly thereafter and the place has gone to

[00:48:49.020 --> 00:48:53.840]
Gone to hell because let me tell you it was one of the great cities in the 60s and even for expo 67

[00:48:54.540 --> 00:49:00.160]
Uh the 50s in the 60s even for expo 67 the world's fair was there and and it was a great city

[00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:05.960]
But all the major corporations that had their corporate head offices in Montreal all had to move out because of the bilingualism

[00:49:05.960 --> 00:49:08.840]
And Montreal is just a ghost town now

[00:49:08.840 --> 00:49:13.960]
Just a ghost town and even a man, you know what we had the Dicurvenon at last last talky season

[00:49:13.960 --> 00:49:15.900]
And I mean and I didn't know how we'd respond to it

[00:49:15.900 --> 00:49:17.640]
But boy he sure didn't back away from it

[00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:23.500]
Even in the hockey team on a Montreal-Canadian's boy if you got a captain on that team who's not a of French

[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:27.700]
A frog you got problems and then that's the way they're operating that team

[00:49:27.700 --> 00:49:31.860]
It's the French speakers against the English which is really pathetic and now they've got a French speaking

[00:49:32.420 --> 00:49:36.220]
Team captain who they're trying to trade you don't want to be captain of the Montreal-Canadian

[00:49:36.220 --> 00:49:41.880]
As a guy they're trying to get rid of right now you they say at least Mario Tromblay that's where his problem is

[00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:44.880]
My my apologies to Doug McLean's who says get off the coaches

[00:49:44.880 --> 00:49:50.400]
But let me tell you that Tromblay does not like Tershane and Tershane is being shopped around and maybe today

[00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:54.120]
You'll tell us the real story about Stefan Riche but I doubt it maybe over the Brandon Chanhan

[00:49:54.780 --> 00:49:58.300]
1056 at W.I.O.D. candle Toyota the biggest of best in the world

[00:49:58.300 --> 00:50:01.220]
Baby if you want a great Toyota. This is the place. They've sold over

[00:50:01.220 --> 00:50:05.340]
135,000 new cars and they're still going strong go in here and see why for yourself

[00:50:05.340 --> 00:50:10.820]
Is it the great service is it the fantastic selection is it the one price selling with the lowest price in the world right there on a windshield

[00:50:10.820 --> 00:50:14.640]
So no pressure no high-junction no games just great the deals all the way around

[00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:19.800]
It's probably a combination of all of the above and a good news for you right now is that all the new 97

[00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:24.560]
Toyota's are in there right now brand new 97 Camry's 97 Corolla's

[00:50:24.560 --> 00:50:30.300]
97 Corolla's rav 4's they got them all at unbeatable prices so no matter what anybody else tells you

[00:50:30.300 --> 00:50:35.900]
I guarantee a candle Toyota will give you the lowest price and the best deal all the way around on that new Toyota of your choice

[00:50:35.900 --> 00:50:39.700]
Kendall Toyota the reason to find right there on us one just out the daydland

[00:50:40.920 --> 00:50:42.760]
Talk in entertainment radio

[00:50:43.580 --> 00:50:47.180]
610 W.I.O.D. Miami Fort Lauderdale

[00:50:48.520 --> 00:50:53.360]
Okay 1058 at W.I.O.D. Rima is with us today the Panthers are leaving what about 230 you guys?

[00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:56.920]
230 this afternoon the guys will be listening on their way. I can assure you of that

[00:50:56.920 --> 00:51:01.140]
Okay, so probably a between 230 and 3 Rick and Sezel tell I'd bring in Chanahan's story

[00:51:01.640 --> 00:51:07.680]
Okay, here's a mobile in in Lake Worth. Hello. Hey Neil. Yes, sir. How's it going great great show Jeff

[00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:08.700]
Thank you

[00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:15.760]
Listen Jeff. I've listened to you on TV and senior and I listen to you on Neil show a lot

[00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:21.220]
And I've flipped over to QAM a couple times and not to rehash any of this

[00:51:21.220 --> 00:51:24.440]
But I think you got a lot more class than the fat Hummster

[00:51:24.820 --> 00:51:29.500]
I really do and that's my opinion. I think I think he just verbally attacks you

[00:51:29.500 --> 00:51:34.240]
I don't know for what reason and I really don't want to get into that but I I do think you have a lot more class to him

[00:51:35.080 --> 00:51:40.120]
And I like your comment excuse me. I said thank you for your comment. Okay. You got to need tickets or hats

[00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:40.640]
Oh

[00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:46.940]
Yeah, you're not kidding. You're not kidding. You're not fooling me. Hey Neil. I'm really

[00:51:46.940 --> 00:51:51.460]
P.O. And I called that woman yesterday. Yes, and I left here all blanchett. Yeah

[00:51:51.460 --> 00:51:56.540]
I got the number that you gave out and I called because I'm unfortunate. I'm under the cable

[00:51:57.520 --> 00:52:03.740]
strain there are the TCI spell. Yeah, and unfortunately I can't just run out and go get a dish right at this moment

[00:52:03.740 --> 00:52:06.140]
Right, you know, got a lot of financial things going on

[00:52:06.140 --> 00:52:10.240]
But I am gonna get one sooner or later. I'll just get your neighbors to call TCI

[00:52:10.240 --> 00:52:15.160]
I'm sure Neil got a lot of people to yesterday. I think it's just totally ridiculous

[00:52:15.560 --> 00:52:18.580]
I think it's a bunch of crap. I mean, I don't need to watch the food channel

[00:52:18.580 --> 00:52:22.460]
I don't need to watch the Haitian station. I want to watch some hockey. I mean these guys are

[00:52:23.060 --> 00:52:27.240]
Stanley Cup man. I mean, well, I guess Neil I guess Neil yesterday hit some

[00:52:28.040 --> 00:52:31.180]
Well some pressure points because you got a phone call as you alluded to earlier

[00:52:31.180 --> 00:52:33.840]
I think I don't call people. You got a phone call over there from

[00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:39.480]
The Cheryl Blanchett. I guess is where we call came and the fact that they would call and complain indicates

[00:52:39.480 --> 00:52:41.340]
I hell of a lot of people must have been calling

[00:52:41.340 --> 00:52:46.400]
But listen listen to this forget all the political bull crap that's going on about sunshine and

[00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:49.560]
We can forget it, but they're not going to that problem

[00:52:49.560 --> 00:52:54.600]
But what about you know, it's like it's a slap in the face to the customer and unfortunately I can't go out in the ceremony

[00:52:54.600 --> 00:52:58.240]
It'll cut the cable today. I can't do that financially at this point in time

[00:52:58.240 --> 00:53:01.800]
So I am under you know, they're the rest, you know, I mean

[00:53:01.800 --> 00:53:07.920]
But you know something they're only they're only forced tolling the obvious because the marlins are gonna be on there

[00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:11.160]
The panthers got 65 games this season going to be on there

[00:53:11.340 --> 00:53:16.180]
The Jimmy Johnson show the Reno show all these shows are going to be on there the Doug McLean show that

[00:53:16.180 --> 00:53:18.960]
I'm in a Phil's stuff here is going to be on sports Channel Florida

[00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:23.440]
So they're only postponing the inevitable TCI sooner or later and hopefully sooner

[00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:27.180]
They're going to have to cave in and put it on here because it's going to have too much stuff on there

[00:53:27.180 --> 00:53:33.200]
That the public wants to see and it's going to take more than just the sports fans or the hockey fan or the baseball fan

[00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:35.940]
It's going to take collectively all the people that are on that system

[00:53:35.940 --> 00:53:40.160]
To let them know because right now they're bragging that only 10% of their subscribers

[00:53:40.160 --> 00:53:46.500]
Are calling in and complaining that's crap and another thing you know like you said and I can't even see the Jimmy Johnson show

[00:53:46.500 --> 00:53:53.220]
The show's on there. I mean it this is stuff where I can understand if it's a station up in New York trying to be down to here

[00:53:53.220 --> 00:53:55.240]
Yeah, I want to show us the Rangers or the jets

[00:53:55.720 --> 00:54:01.820]
Different for this is hometown and it's just crap and I'm well, I guess I'm pissed keep up keep pushing the calls man

[00:54:01.820 --> 00:54:04.280]
Hey Jeff, so I won't be able to see you tomorrow night

[00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:09.720]
But good luck and have a good one while we're looking forward the season and hopefully sooner than later as Neil says

[00:54:09.720 --> 00:54:14.680]
They cave in and they give the people what they want here itself lorda and that is sports channel Florida

[00:54:14.680 --> 00:54:16.440]
Here's a lady and Miami. Hello

[00:54:16.440 --> 00:54:23.280]
Well my point is totally gone now because fortunately you stop talking about the umpires and the baseball and everything else

[00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:27.720]
We haven't stopped we haven't stopped talking about a we're talking about whatever you want to talk about

[00:54:27.720 --> 00:54:29.760]
Oh, because I just except for bilingualism

[00:54:30.540 --> 00:54:33.440]
I'm just so tired hearing about these

[00:54:33.440 --> 00:54:34.820]
These um

[00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:39.980]
Umpires who basically are really trying to kill the game

[00:54:39.980 --> 00:54:40.700]
I

[00:54:41.320 --> 00:54:45.760]
They're trying to show that they're more powerful and baseball and that really

[00:54:45.760 --> 00:54:49.440]
Fixed me off. I don't think they're trying to show that they're more powerful than baseball

[00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:53.200]
What they're trying to do is make a statement on behalf of john herspect

[00:54:53.200 --> 00:54:58.400]
They're trying to stay together and they know bottom line as I said here in the last 15 minutes

[00:54:58.400 --> 00:55:02.940]
They know bottom line. They're gonna go into court and Philadelphia and the judge is going to rule them back to work

[00:55:03.820 --> 00:55:06.320]
It's gonna happen later today, but what kind of

[00:55:06.860 --> 00:55:11.240]
Affishiating are you gonna have with umpires who are who are that kicked off?

[00:55:11.420 --> 00:55:16.640]
Well, they're gonna do their job. Well, I'm gonna tell you something the umpires have got a lot of problems

[00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:20.620]
And when john McSherry keel over and died from a heart attack an opening day in Cincinnati

[00:55:21.300 --> 00:55:25.280]
That just that all I did was just reinforced the fact was you know for years

[00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:28.160]
But nobody ever talked about that a lot of these guys are out of shape

[00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:31.880]
Eric Greg went up there to Duke University on the rice diet lost 60 pounds

[00:55:31.880 --> 00:55:35.540]
I don't know where he lost it because he was behind a plate last night and he landed Dodger game

[00:55:35.540 --> 00:55:38.600]
And he still stands to join out. He's still bigger than a house out of shape

[00:55:38.600 --> 00:55:42.500]
And his is officiating his horrendous how much money did they make

[00:55:42.960 --> 00:55:46.460]
They make good money. They do yes. They do. I mean because are they

[00:55:47.080 --> 00:55:53.120]
They think you know to me it seems like they're irritated with the fact that they're not making as much money as the players

[00:55:53.120 --> 00:55:56.000]
I've seen a lot of lousy calls in the past year

[00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:57.600]
Not just in baseball

[00:55:57.600 --> 00:55:59.640]
We saw a couple in the Dodger game last night

[00:55:59.640 --> 00:56:02.220]
The bottom of the night thinning. I mean

[00:56:02.800 --> 00:56:07.100]
I'm a Dodger fan and I was very very angry

[00:56:08.920 --> 00:56:14.100]
It's a situation though where that bothers me about the officials and they're gonna make mistakes be it hockey football

[00:56:14.100 --> 00:56:19.520]
We saw big mistake in the Monday night football game. What about the jet stain? Oh, well, it's just what I'm talking about

[00:56:20.960 --> 00:56:24.640]
Unconsciously unconscionable mistake and then for them to come out two days later and say well

[00:56:24.640 --> 00:56:29.160]
We made a mistake doesn't mean a hillabees. I mean I have a suggestion

[00:56:29.160 --> 00:56:31.200]
But no one will listen to it because I'm a woman

[00:56:31.200 --> 00:56:39.860]
But if they would say to the coaches. Okay, you have three times that you can say I want the game stopped and I want that look

[00:56:39.860 --> 00:56:41.380]
Well, they did that during the preseason

[00:56:41.380 --> 00:56:44.940]
But unfortunately they're not doing it during the regular season and it makes a mockery out of the game

[00:56:44.940 --> 00:56:50.340]
And you have games you already had that you already had that one game you had that one game decided by an

[00:56:50.340 --> 00:56:54.260]
Officials mistake and you're gonna have more of those before the season is over and it stinks

[00:56:54.260 --> 00:57:00.480]
It's I mean when you're gonna when you're gonna pay that kind of money to go out and support a team to watch your team play

[00:57:00.480 --> 00:57:06.660]
And then they're gonna wind up losing a game based on somebody's a bonehead call or the fact that nobody's got the balls to make the right call

[00:57:06.660 --> 00:57:10.480]
Which in that case they had a conference that went on long after the fact was over

[00:57:11.320 --> 00:57:15.300]
It's very this heartening. What's the point? Yeah, and then did you see that other game?

[00:57:15.420 --> 00:57:18.640]
I can't remember which thing was where the official was standing in the way the ball hit him on head

[00:57:19.580 --> 00:57:21.820]
Well, maybe that was an omen. Have a great day there

[00:57:22.540 --> 00:57:24.020]
Again, I I

[00:57:24.020 --> 00:57:26.600]
Hey, we're all human beings. We will all make mistakes

[00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:30.880]
But what bothers me is an especially in baseball is this

[00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:35.840]
Provoking by officials and umpires and in the case of her spec again

[00:57:35.840 --> 00:57:42.660]
Robert Alamar or Virdo Alamar is is a class act he what he did was classless

[00:57:43.280 --> 00:57:48.460]
But obviously he was provoked and if you look at the video love for what you don't have to worry about

[00:57:48.460 --> 00:57:52.380]
Look into video because any any especially channel seven just turn it on there for five minutes

[00:57:52.380 --> 00:57:56.960]
And even if they're talking about the war in the Middle East or whatever their whatever the topic is no seriously

[00:57:56.960 --> 00:58:03.000]
They have shown that 50,000 times in the last 24 hours just over and over and over again

[00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:08.820]
And of course the more that they show it the more it incites the public and the more you see the actual act of spitting in somebody's face

[00:58:08.820 --> 00:58:14.520]
The more it aggravates. Well, that's disgusting and you know people are basically almost unanimously on the aside of the umpires

[00:58:14.520 --> 00:58:16.900]
Except for the fact they don't believe they should walk out

[00:58:16.900 --> 00:58:23.720]
No, and I would think at this point that despite going to court today that the umpires will be on the field tonight

[00:58:23.720 --> 00:58:27.020]
I hope there's a coconut grove. Hello. Hello. Yes

[00:58:27.540 --> 00:58:31.040]
Uh Neil, hmm first time caller great show

[00:58:31.680 --> 00:58:33.920]
Except when you get into the sports talk business

[00:58:33.920 --> 00:58:37.880]
Yeah, and I feel like it's gonna be time to tune you out until after the hockey season

[00:58:37.880 --> 00:58:42.140]
Yeah, you know, you tell us when we call up that we can talk about what we want to you know

[00:58:42.560 --> 00:58:46.700]
You'll you'll lament about the fact that we don't let me ask you something. Let me ask you this go ahead

[00:58:46.900 --> 00:58:51.160]
How many guests do I have on this show? How often do I have a guest and I appreciate that yeah

[00:58:51.160 --> 00:58:55.500]
I appreciate the fact that Ramazan and you want to talk to rumour and you guys are doing sports for two hours

[00:58:55.500 --> 00:58:59.180]
Yeah, well you want to talk about something else. Why can't we do it between you and him too?

[00:58:59.180 --> 00:59:02.480]
Well, I mean a guy called just a few minutes ago wanted to talk about something else

[00:59:02.480 --> 00:59:05.140]
And you know something if rumour weren't here

[00:59:05.140 --> 00:59:08.280]
I still wouldn't do what I was this to kind of show I would discuss bilingualism

[00:59:09.320 --> 00:59:13.000]
Well, no, and maybe you're being syndicated a Montreal. Yeah

[00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:15.980]
Yeah, maybe that I'm up there with the frogs probably who douchebag

[00:59:17.400 --> 00:59:17.800]
No

[00:59:18.340 --> 00:59:22.200]
So now the words you just call to complain again. You have nothing to contribute you just call to complain

[00:59:22.200 --> 00:59:23.800]
Well, no, I would have something to contribute

[00:59:23.800 --> 00:59:27.960]
But all you want to do is talk about sports talk and I think that you as it's a it's a

[00:59:27.960 --> 00:59:34.280]
Validates a position that I have to tell you that I don't particularly can't listen to the Neil Rogers show when it's nothing but sports talk

[00:59:34.280 --> 00:59:38.260]
Yeah, I'm gonna listen to sports practice QAM. I mean there's there's other places to go

[00:59:38.800 --> 00:59:44.620]
You want to hear a bunch of pimpley-faced kids talking about what they think they know about sports that's QAM for the most part

[00:59:46.480 --> 00:59:46.920]
Well

[00:59:46.920 --> 00:59:46.920]

[00:59:46.920 --> 00:59:50.880]
I'll give you some time go. Maybe you can find Andrews ass in the woods

[00:59:50.880 --> 00:59:55.400]
Good luck pal. Get out of here two open lines and date seven five. Oh boy that last cigar

[00:59:56.960 --> 01:00:00.780]
Killer I may remember I have to take over the show may have to cancel a broadcast

[01:00:01.380 --> 01:00:07.780]
Two open lines and date seven five one W I O D. We have an open line and Broward five two four nine four six three

[01:00:07.780 --> 01:00:12.320]
Here's West Palm Beach. Hello Neil. Yes, sir. How you doing? Okay first off chef

[01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:15.120]
Total class not to have to kneel kneel

[01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:18.160]
Stoop down to the Hank's level

[01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:25.920]
Thank you. I have more special you by whatever you know by what you don't do and whatever you could do

[01:00:29.420 --> 01:00:33.620]
Go ahead no, I think the plate umpire has way too much power

[01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:37.540]
I mean I saw I didn't watch the game last night I was watching the overtime

[01:00:37.540 --> 01:00:41.580]
They replayed the overtime passes game last night. Yeah, and uh by flashback

[01:00:41.580 --> 01:00:46.220]
Just to see the scores. I saw one pitch in the Dodgers game that wasn't even close to the plate

[01:00:46.780 --> 01:00:52.080]
And he called I know exactly when you're talking about it. It was about two feet outside not just a foot outside

[01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:56.220]
Eric Greg called the pitch a strike that you couldn't hit with two bed slats tied together

[01:00:56.220 --> 01:00:59.420]
And I'm again, I'll say you can't be right on every pitch

[01:00:59.420 --> 01:01:00.820]
But when you're so wrong

[01:01:00.820 --> 01:01:03.320]
I mean when you've been trained for this when you've been doing it for years

[01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:08.760]
And yet when the quality of your work is so inconsistent and so slip shot it makes a joke out of the game exactly

[01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:11.760]
I have been the two marbles games of my life in fact

[01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:14.600]
I'll tell you who was it was Ryan Klusko because I remember him walking away

[01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:19.680]
Oh, yeah, getting up in Greg's face for a second then walking away, you know figuring he don't need to get suspended either

[01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:22.060]
But uh it was um it was unbelievable

[01:01:22.060 --> 01:01:26.340]
That was that that just kind of typified the baseball form and I saw that and said that

[01:01:26.340 --> 01:01:28.660]
That umpire is that much power that he just you know

[01:01:28.660 --> 01:01:34.640]
In the game of this important and that close score. He called him up. You know it's that's crazy. But um

[01:01:35.140 --> 01:01:38.480]
I don't know just watching the the pamphlet replay last night gave me goose bumps

[01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:42.460]
You know being there and yes about third time seen it but that was some kind of game

[01:01:42.460 --> 01:01:46.460]
Kind of what's your appetite for the start of the season? Oh, we got the midst of opening night

[01:01:46.460 --> 01:01:51.600]
I've got to work. We got to rerun hockey leagues up here. So I won't go but oh, I'm dying. I can't wait to get back

[01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:58.420]
Um, I just hope they haven't I hope they haven't put too much pressure on jolvan oski soldiers every time I open

[01:01:58.420 --> 01:02:02.760]
Paper's got full page picture of my front the guy's only what 20 years old

[01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:03.760]
Well

[01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:10.620]
Uh, good for jolvan oski and maybe bad for jolvan oski is that he is the guy that

[01:02:10.620 --> 01:02:16.280]
When you talk about the florida panthers aside from john van b's brook people start talking about and this is going to be his second year

[01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:18.520]
He's obviously got a lot to learn. He says it himself

[01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:23.080]
And this is going to be a more difficult year for jolvan oski because not unlike the entire team

[01:02:23.080 --> 01:02:28.640]
More is going to be expected of him and the the opposition is going to be getting form a little more than they were last year

[01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:32.840]
Kind of reminds me of merino a bit when merino took him to the soup bull right regatta

[01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:39.260]
And i'll say no we're going every year and then what happened? I mean, I hope to god that doesn't happen expectations are going to be high

[01:02:39.260 --> 01:02:42.560]
It's evenly high. I just don't hope it you know he's young. I hope it doesn't

[01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:48.640]
Effectamentally or he'll be fine. Yeah. Okay. Neil. Hey great show. Neil's talk as much sports as you want to screw those guys

[01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:51.400]
Okay, thanks a lot. Yeah, don't worry about these other guys

[01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:53.380]
They're listening and they just called you know

[01:02:53.380 --> 01:02:56.580]
Why are you talking about this and then of course if we weren't talking about this

[01:02:56.580 --> 01:03:00.380]
And you brought up 75 other things which I do most mornings. They don't call anyway

[01:03:00.380 --> 01:03:06.020]
So what what difference does it matter? I got news for you this this story and you talk about channel seven and over and over and over again

[01:03:06.020 --> 01:03:13.600]
Showing the video this story transcends sports and on every news show in in every market all they've talked about or the umpire

[01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:19.320]
Situation's been the lead story was lead story last night. Yeah, and on the major news right across the country

[01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:25.060]
And especially we get you know jim liland one of the most popular and most love managers in baseball in a long time

[01:03:25.060 --> 01:03:27.340]
He's coming here. He's not going to Boston

[01:03:27.340 --> 01:03:30.840]
He's not going to California or Chicago. He's coming here. That's great. I mean

[01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:33.460]
There are a lot of really profound things going on today

[01:03:33.460 --> 01:03:35.960]
The umpires are threatening to walk out again this afternoon

[01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:40.640]
So this is what's going on okay? If you can find something else going on here be fight a few bodies in the street

[01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:43.680]
I'd love to hear what it is and as far as bilingualism is concerned

[01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:44.840]
Polly vu

[01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:47.240]
You're rectum here's the Hollywood. Hello

[01:03:47.740 --> 01:03:50.960]
Hi Neil. Yes, sir. Listen. I have to agree with you second last call

[01:03:51.880 --> 01:03:57.280]
You know you show space today. Yeah, so why you still listening? Well, well because I like listening to

[01:03:57.340 --> 01:03:57.760]
Oh

[01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:04.800]
So in other words even if the show stinks you'll still be listening so what difference is I will yeah? Yeah

[01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:06.180]
I probably will tune you off you know

[01:04:06.180 --> 01:04:10.700]
Yeah after after you're done here in the Saudi world voice you'll turn me off blow it out your ass

[01:04:10.700 --> 01:04:11.520]
idiot

[01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:17.500]
Probably another one of Hank's boyfriends open line and date seven five one nine four six three seven five one

[01:04:17.500 --> 01:04:22.000]
Brackham and an open line on the abrower line five two four. He wouldn't know Andrews ass in the woods if he founded

[01:04:23.080 --> 01:04:24.420]
Here's a sunrise. Hello

[01:04:24.980 --> 01:04:31.600]
Yeah, go on. Okay, I remember the on only one one. Once every couple months. Yeah, we got a relic this time we're spending together

[01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:37.720]
That's right I do an excellent time. Hey listen to this baseball thing if it was that the first game that he's me did this

[01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:43.940]
How long do you think it would be before the appeals process when through and all that and he would this sentence was handed down

[01:04:43.940 --> 01:04:47.800]
Well number one he dropped his appeal right and the only reason these guys

[01:04:48.560 --> 01:04:54.340]
And it's happened all the time that these players are suspended the only reason why he appealed

[01:04:54.340 --> 01:05:00.580]
And any other player appeals is to delay the suspension for a convenient time right but there is a precedent and that he is

[01:05:01.300 --> 01:05:04.580]
If players are going to be suspended. It's for regular season play

[01:05:04.580 --> 01:05:09.580]
But we've seen so many times a base brawl if you will and and the player will

[01:05:09.580 --> 01:05:15.180]
Appeal his suspension and then all of a sudden he'll have pitched in the previous game or hit a home around the previous game

[01:05:15.180 --> 01:05:18.740]
And all of a sudden he's dropping this appeal and beginning his suspension immediately

[01:05:18.740 --> 01:05:24.540]
But there's no precedent for suspensions to take place during the playoffs during the postseason

[01:05:24.540 --> 01:05:29.300]
And it wasn't going to happen in this case and the outpires know it but again to rally around her spec

[01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:34.160]
They're making a statement. So is that like an actual rule in the book that suspension means all inter and regular season

[01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:38.500]
There's no precedent for suspensions in the postseason all right

[01:05:39.120 --> 01:05:41.180]
All right, well, I think you should

[01:05:41.700 --> 01:05:43.020]
Says time out

[01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:47.300]
When right now, oh, you'd like him to sit out now. Yeah

[01:05:47.300 --> 01:05:49.920]
You thought it was pretty rude and crude

[01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:52.720]
Well, what about being provoked?

[01:05:53.340 --> 01:05:54.740]
Look at it from his side

[01:05:55.480 --> 01:05:58.540]
Okay, a lot of people are provoked and they spend time in jail for it

[01:05:58.540 --> 01:06:05.960]
You know, like you get how many guys how many guys of you let me ask you this how many guys have you ever known to spend time in jail for spitting on some

[01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:09.800]
I'm talking on another case is like guys provoked out in the street and they're not talking about

[01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:17.200]
Point out a gun we're talking about in any sporting event where there's a level of intensity like there is in baseball or hockey or football

[01:06:17.300 --> 01:06:22.200]
where that's level of intensity and where there's a major disagreement and tempers flare

[01:06:22.940 --> 01:06:26.960]
And granted you don't see this very often. Thank goodness. How long have you been watching people?

[01:06:26.980 --> 01:06:31.980]
But we're talking about the potential for somebody doing something in in the heat of

[01:06:31.980 --> 01:06:34.480]
And he didn't take out a knife and slid his neck

[01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:36.560]
He didn't hit him and he didn't punch him in the face

[01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:41.420]
And then like Jeff says how do you know what happened to provoke him and nobody seems to care about that

[01:06:41.420 --> 01:06:47.280]
Yeah, why I got a stand up? How far how far do you push somebody before you expect to

[01:06:47.300 --> 01:06:51.120]
To respond or you expect they might respond and especially when you know we can't hit him

[01:06:51.120 --> 01:06:56.540]
He can't punch him. He can't push him. He can't shove him right what else was he gonna do if he was provoked to that point

[01:06:56.540 --> 01:06:59.440]
Okay, his team got in on the last game of season wasn't it

[01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:07.840]
Then he hit the home run to one of the game right so Saturday's last Saturday right every game during this season was just as important as each playoff games

[01:07:08.480 --> 01:07:14.140]
How do they differ just because they're playing for the world series each game was just as important to them because they got in on the very last game

[01:07:14.140 --> 01:07:18.020]
Well, that's that's ridiculous. I mean, that's the technicality once you get to the postseason

[01:07:18.020 --> 01:07:22.800]
You can especially in a short series in a three out of five you can't say every game during the regular seasons is important

[01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:24.980]
Let me ask you this question. How long have you followed baseball

[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:30.500]
Ever since the blue case winner the tronics that's a problem. Oh, you're from Toronto. Yeah. All right. How many times

[01:07:31.300 --> 01:07:33.820]
Did you see? I tied don't made a never haul off

[01:07:34.700 --> 01:07:43.980]
How many times did you see a manager and I'm thinking in terms of of Earl Weaver in ball the more Billy Martin in Texas or or New York with the Yankees

[01:07:43.980 --> 01:07:46.460]
Kick dirt in the outpires face

[01:07:47.640 --> 01:07:50.440]
Washington outpired bumping outpires part me

[01:07:52.140 --> 01:07:57.520]
All right, well wouldn't you think that some of those actions were just as bad as Roberto Alamars

[01:07:58.220 --> 01:08:01.460]
And I'm not condoning what he did, but he snapped and was provoked

[01:08:01.460 --> 01:08:04.340]
Why think one is a little more disgusting than the other and

[01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:10.240]
You know, I think dark kicking was allowed because I think

[01:08:10.700 --> 01:08:15.680]
That's as far as they should go. No, you've never seen one of Earl Weaver's tie rates in ball the more when he was managing

[01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:22.160]
The Orioles before being enshrined in the Hall of Famous last August some of the stuff that he did was not very classy either

[01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:26.240]
Okay, with all this hoopla. Maybe they should put something in the rule book to send it straight from now on

[01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:30.480]
That's a good idea and it once and for maybe he can use a real commissioner too, so we don't have to go through this

I just want to hear you when we make one of those great goals you have to come up with some lines some new lines

[01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:15.320]
I'm like

[01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:21.540]
This is great like jumping jelly beans. Yeah, put a little spice in it. Okay. Oh, it's a fat

[01:11:22.300 --> 01:11:25.240]
All right, okay listen. I went on one of those coffee crews

[01:11:25.240 --> 01:11:30.440]
Too pennies now you're talking. I went on one of those coffee cruises. Unfortunately, I had a late

[01:11:31.180 --> 01:11:38.040]
Sitting for dinner and after the waiter's finished dancing with the dessert the world cup was on so I run down to the main floor

[01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:44.820]
There's a cruise like to over 2000 people. I go the TV the big screen TV to have on there's two people sitting there

[01:11:44.820 --> 01:11:48.840]
Watching the hockey game. Yeah, I start talking with them. They're from Detroit, Michigan

[01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:51.740]
Then we start talking about the panthers and the red wings and so on so on

[01:11:51.740 --> 01:11:57.320]
So about 50 minutes after talking the the white wings over she says to me her two brothers

[01:11:58.200 --> 01:12:02.820]
Play in the national hockey league. I said what his two brothers. So it was Hatcher

[01:12:03.380 --> 01:12:05.800]
Gary Hatcher with his name. Hi, Mark Hatcher

[01:12:06.360 --> 01:12:10.060]
Mark Hatcher. That's what his name was. Oh, Mark when that guy stood up

[01:12:10.060 --> 01:12:14.280]
He is big as his brothers are Mark's bigger mark mark

[01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:20.000]
Mark played in Baltimore in the American Hockey League and is bigger than Kevin and Darian and I understand now

[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:25.460]
He's about 300 pounds right. He's a big guy. Yeah, so that was mr. Hatcher to you

[01:12:25.460 --> 01:12:28.280]
Pardon mr. Hatcher to you mr. Hatcher right?

[01:12:28.820 --> 01:12:31.800]
So that was a real neat thing to meet somebody there like that

[01:12:31.800 --> 01:12:35.460]
So but we were the only ones with two thousand people watching the hockey game there

[01:12:35.460 --> 01:12:40.480]
That's great. Yeah, so go panthers and thanks a lot. Okay. Have a great day. Take care

[01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:42.980]
Bye. Yeah, we sure don't want no violence in hockey all today

[01:12:42.980 --> 01:12:46.300]
You're as fringible for quid on a half board for those captain's front

[01:12:46.300 --> 01:12:47.000]
fringible

[01:12:47.540 --> 01:12:48.320]
with the puck

[01:12:48.320 --> 01:12:49.280]
28 seconds

[01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:50.600]
That's gonna fly away

[01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:52.080]
And no blonde here

[01:12:52.700 --> 01:12:54.680]
Maybe to get it to the pot here's a great

[01:12:54.680 --> 01:12:56.280]
Losing away from

[01:12:56.280 --> 01:12:56.680]
Sova

[01:12:56.680 --> 01:12:57.020]
That

[01:12:57.020 --> 01:12:57.480]
Liggy

[01:12:57.480 --> 01:12:57.860]
Bad

[01:12:58.500 --> 01:12:59.180]
Short handed

[01:12:59.180 --> 01:13:00.760]
And the panthers lead

[01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:02.020]
What's that up

[01:13:02.020 --> 01:13:02.540]
Oh

[01:13:02.540 --> 01:13:03.700]
Ball while p cow kick

[01:13:03.700 --> 01:13:06.300]
See if you just would have said ball while p cow kick

[01:13:06.300 --> 01:13:10.800]
You said that will be more memorable. You know, she Rachel Alexander's now in Washington

[01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:15.080]
Yeah, I keep beat writer for the Washington Post. Yeah, isn't that a frightening story about journal

[01:13:15.080 --> 01:13:20.100]
You're in the America on here's the same woman that was talking about Doug McLean getting petition signed in

[01:13:20.700 --> 01:13:25.160]
As summer side in p.e.i. By Tim Horton who owns the local donut shop

[01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:29.140]
Tim Horton who used to play for Leafs and the Sabers has been dead for over 20 years

[01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:34.980]
Has the biggest his wife owns the biggest chain of donut shops all over Canada Tim Horton's donuts

[01:13:34.980 --> 01:13:40.100]
And she just you know it goes to show you getting a little bit information is dangerous when you have no idea what you're talking about

[01:13:40.100 --> 01:13:43.360]
I went to surprise she didn't get a job on QAM. I went to

[01:13:43.860 --> 01:13:44.900]
Somerside p.e.i

[01:13:44.900 --> 01:13:49.580]
Obviously with the Panther training camp, but I went to that Tim Horton's donuts and I was looking for Tim

[01:13:49.580 --> 01:13:53.120]
But hey after an hour. I kind of got the hint. He wasn't gonna show up

[01:13:54.760 --> 01:13:56.900]
How about foster he would he might have been there

[01:13:57.940 --> 01:14:02.320]
Here's Hollywood hello. Hello. Yes, sir. Hey, how you doing today? Okay, sir

[01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:05.460]
Hello, Daniel and hello to Rimmer. Hello you all right

[01:14:06.220 --> 01:14:10.220]
Two things I wanted to touch on basically with baseball. I played baseball in my life

[01:14:10.220 --> 01:14:13.720]
And I was in a minor league for a while and how high up did you get?

[01:14:14.180 --> 01:14:15.180]
St. Lucy met

[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:20.780]
Played for a couple years and dropped out had a family and that and uh, but you know

[01:14:20.780 --> 01:14:25.120]
What's really just hard about baseball is last year? I went to the last game this season

[01:14:25.740 --> 01:14:28.860]
Took my four kids and uh, that's my fault, but

[01:14:30.500 --> 01:14:34.440]
They wouldn't even look at you in the bullpen. They wouldn't even look at you and give you an autograph or anything else

[01:14:34.440 --> 01:14:36.940]
That's really just hardening for the kids and everything else, you know

[01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:42.160]
And this was last year last year and I took it to the last game this year too and

[01:14:43.020 --> 01:14:46.460]
Same thing. It was like, you know, I changed my attitude again. I said well

[01:14:46.460 --> 01:14:53.460]
The kids are gonna take them and everything else and I don't I don't think they have any any sense that the kids are more important than

[01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:57.180]
Especially last game of the year without a doubt and you know what?

[01:14:57.780 --> 01:15:03.340]
I thought the baseball I thought baseball made a concerted effort last year after the long

[01:15:03.860 --> 01:15:06.620]
Lockout and the strike and baseball and a guy

[01:15:07.240 --> 01:15:11.380]
Probably that exemplified the way baseball players should be is Cal Ripken

[01:15:11.380 --> 01:15:14.620]
I hate to talk about a guy that I was around for 10 years and ball the more

[01:15:14.620 --> 01:15:17.320]
But the fact of the matter is if you remember while he was still chasing

[01:15:17.960 --> 01:15:20.580]
Lugarex record for consecutive games, which he's now surpassed

[01:15:20.580 --> 01:15:26.600]
He went out of his way to spend a half an hour either before batting practice or after batting practice

[01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:34.200]
Every city that he went to to sign autographs and baseball the players association even said we've got to get back to the grassroots

[01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:39.120]
We've got to let the fans know that we've got nothing but time for them and that's kind of disheartening to believe

[01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:43.020]
I'm going when you take four kids to a ball game, you know, I make 40 years a year or whatever

[01:15:43.020 --> 01:15:45.980]
But that's that's the size of point when you take a kid to a game or whatever

[01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:50.040]
It's this heartening if I get about here. I'm gonna spend a hundred dollars easy

[01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:51.800]
you know

[01:15:51.800 --> 01:15:55.820]
When they can't even get the risk of making a good point

[01:15:55.820 --> 01:16:00.540]
It's a very good point that now just to get into the ball game the average person can't afford to go very often

[01:16:00.540 --> 01:16:06.680]
I was telling you right that's right and then to top it off adding insult to injury if you want somebody's autograph

[01:16:06.680 --> 01:16:11.580]
Well come and see me at the at the card show and I'll you for 75 bucks. I'll give you an autograph

[01:16:11.580 --> 01:16:14.260]
You know you know you want to grab his hand when I played semi pro ball

[01:16:14.260 --> 01:16:16.300]
I mean, you know, I went out of my way to

[01:16:16.720 --> 01:16:20.760]
And I was no nobody you know, I'm saying but that's not the point the thing is

[01:16:20.760 --> 01:16:26.220]
You were there in they made a point of it then even in St. Lucy mess. They made a point of it

[01:16:26.220 --> 01:16:31.420]
To please the fans and her yeah, but I don't see that. I don't see that. I think that's really hurting the whole thing

[01:16:31.860 --> 01:16:35.980]
It don't dishearten me. It just disheartens the kids and that's what really gets me amen

[01:16:35.980 --> 01:16:43.220]
And how are you doing today? Great great. How's Neil doing great? You still smoking that doggy still has puffing on it

[01:16:43.220 --> 01:16:49.280]
All right come down pick that tool up a single while is there anywhere you can get a your autograph and his autograph and a bumpers thickam maybe sure

[01:16:49.280 --> 01:16:53.240]
Whatever you want I can come down a little while my name is Marty. Okay, 50 bucks. Hey

[01:16:55.120 --> 01:17:01.600]
No problem. You take me to lunch. Okay, Marty. All right. See you later. Bye. Bye. Why not? I could never charge for an autograph

[01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:07.360]
I'm Rick Weaver and that's my opinion for news talk radio 610 W I O D but Rick who wanted okay

[01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:10.600]
We have an open line of Howard 5249 468 for an autograph

[01:17:10.600 --> 01:17:12.800]
We see we got a card for everything okay

[01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:17.320]
We got something and wait till you see the new setup we're gonna have how are you gonna get all these carts?

[01:17:18.100 --> 01:17:20.200]
Card it over and

[01:17:20.580 --> 01:17:24.060]
Obviously, they'll all be on computer right right that'll be awesome. It'll be a project

[01:17:24.060 --> 01:17:28.220]
But everything's gonna be in the you won't believe it the stuff we're gonna be able to do in fact

[01:17:28.220 --> 01:17:31.460]
One of the things we discovered in that 360 which is a little machine

[01:17:31.460 --> 01:17:33.360]
It's got all the buttons on it for all the quick drop-ins

[01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:39.180]
We've got the various gun sounds which I would thought would be appropriate for my Bob Green tribute on two dear Wednesday

[01:17:39.180 --> 01:17:40.540]
Whatever's our first day in that studio?

[01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:46.960]
Are you starting? Are you huh? Oh, yeah, and it starts out of course with the son of the sound of the gun cocking and then

[01:17:47.660 --> 01:17:49.460]
And of course there's an unlimited number of

[01:17:49.460 --> 01:17:53.580]
We can do it like a variety of ways. So anyway, it's 1127

[01:17:54.220 --> 01:17:57.260]
At W they won't take it personal of course at W. I. O. D

[01:17:57.260 --> 01:18:01.240]
There's some realities in today's world that need to be addressed like the safety of you and your family

That's why liquid bullet is a product you should know about liquid bullets a small state of the art defense weapon

[01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:11.860]
That uses a high-powered chemical stream that is 80 times more powerful than mace

[01:18:11.860 --> 01:18:16.960]
But it's still safe to keep in a house with children. So while it's effective as a gun. It's lots safer trust me

[01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:19.940]
Liquid bullet reaches up to a 20 feet circle of defense

[01:18:19.940 --> 01:18:26.160]
It leaves your attacker helpless for up to 20 minutes, but there no after effects the liquid bullet can be concealed in the palm of your hand

[01:18:59.660 --> 01:19:04.740]
We're gonna turn it off pretty soon. Okay, just keep saying that man. You couldn't turn this show off if somebody held a gun to your

[01:19:04.740 --> 01:19:10.020]
Push it's 1131 a day or spitting your push exactly or called you a

[01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:18.820]
Dushbag here's West Palm Beach. Hello. Yeah, Neil. Yes, sir. Hey, listen did you hear the humster last night? No, I don't listen to the humster

[01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:25.060]
You made an attack on river. Oh, that's unusual. Yeah, and I have it on tape. Can I play it for you?

[01:19:26.260 --> 01:19:30.900]
Why bother well, I thought you might be interested. What does he say? I'll play it

[01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:42.620]
Yeah, sounds good. Okay, we have an open-line at a 751 one on the green line. What 800 what do you say? Oh, yeah?

[01:19:42.820 --> 01:19:46.860]
That's not new for him. Here's highly a hello. Hey, how you doing? No, okay, sir?

[01:19:47.160 --> 01:19:50.860]
First I want to thank the Lord that hockey season starts tonight

[01:19:51.620 --> 01:19:54.060]
Oh, three months too long. Yeah

[01:19:54.720 --> 01:20:01.300]
Second thing I wanted to comment on was about my cable company and I understood earlier in the week

[01:20:01.300 --> 01:20:07.280]
Somebody said to me that you you were publicly broadcasting the phone number for the direct line to TCI

[01:20:07.280 --> 01:20:12.660]
Yes, sir Colorado. Can you give it to me again, please? Okay, the best number in Denver is

[01:20:14.440 --> 01:20:16.420]
two it's area code 303

[01:20:18.780 --> 01:20:19.260]
267

[01:20:22.080 --> 01:20:25.280]
5500 and the guy to talk to his name is Jed Palmer

[01:20:28.180 --> 01:20:29.140]
Yeah, but

[01:20:29.140 --> 01:20:33.780]
And if people and people want to call Shera Blanchett at the local which is probably wasted time

[01:20:33.780 --> 01:20:41.780]
It's 954 it's a Broward number 723. I'm just giving this out for anybody else. Oh, no, five nine five four seven two three seventy one thirty eight

[01:20:41.780 --> 01:20:42.680]
And I don't care

[01:20:43.660 --> 01:20:48.800]
Because I've called up numerous times and so's my boss. We all have TCI and they really think

[01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:50.860]
Yeah, I

[01:20:50.860 --> 01:20:53.900]
It's not it's not it's not it's not it's they want you to think that it's a waste of time

[01:20:53.900 --> 01:20:57.580]
Maybe call him locally will be but if you keep calling their corporate headquarters out there in Denver

[01:20:57.580 --> 01:21:02.360]
It is not gonna be a waste of time if enough people call and keep calling and drive them up the wall

[01:21:02.360 --> 01:21:05.000]
And that because if you just sit back and wait

[01:21:05.500 --> 01:21:11.520]
Who knows if you're ever gonna get it? They're delaying the inevitable and the more people the more people that call and talk to them at

[01:21:11.520 --> 01:21:15.980]
The corporate office. I think the more they'll get the message that it's not just Panther hockey fans

[01:21:15.980 --> 01:21:21.940]
But everybody wants TCI to pick up sports channel. There's all kinds of programming in addition to the hockey program

[01:21:21.940 --> 01:21:27.000]
Which exactly it includes the Panther games the Doug McLean show

[01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:31.820]
There's the NFL show the Jimmy Johnson show. There's a pregame show. There's a game show. There'll be a Jim

[01:21:31.820 --> 01:21:36.300]
Monday night show. Hey, what show Jim Lee Linshow? Oh, they'll be a Jim Lee once we get the baseball season

[01:21:36.300 --> 01:21:37.120]
No, I had

[01:21:37.800 --> 01:21:42.860]
Yeah, it's done deal also that when you come at the Timmy Horton Stonehouse

[01:21:42.860 --> 01:21:48.000]
I wasn't when I was up an Edmonton few months ago. I tell you what I kept looking for Timmy too

[01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:54.000]
But he didn't show up a lot of people been waiting for him. Yeah, Carl Brewer said he's waiting to be and I with him

[01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:57.880]
But it's a long way one day we got to bring in the Ouija board maybe we can bring there you go

[01:21:57.880 --> 01:22:02.540]
Thank you. Thank you. Oh, you have a great day back to you. Yeah, with our luck Harold Ballard show up

[01:22:02.540 --> 01:22:07.000]
We have two open lines and I love seven dollars, huh? I loved her. You would have liked this guy

[01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:10.500]
You would have it's hey listen to me. I know he screwed up the leaves

[01:22:10.500 --> 01:22:14.680]
But what a great guest on a talk show and the Leafs and Montreal on this one I was living

[01:22:17.860 --> 01:22:21.120]
We got the asshole freedom

[01:22:21.660 --> 01:22:22.660]
The asshole

[01:22:22.660 --> 01:22:25.820]
The asshole for Jesus

[01:22:25.820 --> 01:22:28.160]
The asshole for gun

[01:22:28.160 --> 01:22:30.640]
The asshole for justice

[01:22:30.640 --> 01:22:33.120]
The asshole for crime

[01:22:33.120 --> 01:22:35.460]
The asshole for asshole

[01:22:36.140 --> 01:22:37.960]
The asshole for all time

[01:22:46.980 --> 01:22:49.800]
The asshole for making money

[01:22:50.500 --> 01:22:52.160]
The making all the rules

[01:22:52.160 --> 01:22:54.740]
Taking all our jobs

[01:22:54.740 --> 01:22:56.900]
They're filling us by school

[01:22:57.500 --> 01:22:59.480]
The asshole's on the water

[01:22:59.480 --> 01:23:01.500]
The asshole's on the sky

[01:23:01.500 --> 01:23:04.280]
The assignment says he'll want it

[01:23:04.280 --> 01:23:06.460]
The asshole's need a fly

[01:23:10.500 --> 01:23:11.080]
We

[01:23:15.540 --> 01:23:18.500]
Oh teach you won't you tell me

[01:23:18.500 --> 01:23:20.540]
Have I really made the grade?

[01:23:21.140 --> 01:23:22.840]
Have I held my quest?

[01:23:23.140 --> 01:23:27.500]
Or am I just another asshole on the grade?

[01:23:46.540 --> 01:23:47.620]
Oh

[01:23:47.620 --> 01:23:51.780]
Oh god

[01:23:54.500 --> 01:23:56.600]
The asshole's get the orders

[01:23:56.600 --> 01:23:58.500]
And the asshole's broke the boat

[01:23:59.120 --> 01:24:00.500]
The asshole's get elected

[01:24:01.040 --> 01:24:03.340]
The asshole's get the bull

[01:24:03.340 --> 01:24:04.000]
Brackum

[01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:05.920]
I want to start a fight

[01:24:05.920 --> 01:24:08.360]
That old asshole never died

[01:24:09.360 --> 01:24:12.680]
This land is big in smoke fly

[01:24:13.360 --> 01:24:15.320]
The asshole's been mourning

[01:24:15.320 --> 01:24:17.700]
The asshole's been asleep

[01:24:18.360 --> 01:24:20.100]
The asshole's been asleep

[01:24:20.100 --> 01:24:22.480]
The asshole's to the grade

[01:24:22.480 --> 01:24:25.960]
The asshole's been asleep

[01:24:25.960 --> 01:24:27.140]
The asshole's been asleep

[01:24:27.140 --> 01:24:29.980]
The assignment says he'll want it

[01:24:29.980 --> 01:24:31.900]
The asshole's on the grade

[01:24:38.360 --> 01:24:38.360]

[01:24:38.360 --> 01:24:38.520]
The asshole's been asleep

[01:24:43.220 --> 01:24:45.700]
All right, 104, WID, thanks, Rimmer

[01:24:45.700 --> 01:24:46.940]
It was OK in my book

[01:24:46.940 --> 01:24:49.000]
And there we go, they're off to Philadelphia

[01:24:49.560 --> 01:24:51.400]
Team will be on a way at 230 flight

[01:24:51.400 --> 01:24:53.280]
They're going to kick the flyers ass tomorrow night

[01:24:53.280 --> 01:24:55.400]
And who knows, might even wind up with a sweep opening

[01:24:55.400 --> 01:24:56.340]
We can against the Rangers

[01:24:56.340 --> 01:24:58.080]
They'll kid yourself, man, the Rangers

[01:24:58.080 --> 01:24:59.440]
Highly over-touted

[01:24:59.440 --> 01:25:01.440]
Especially with that needle nose on air

[01:25:01.440 --> 01:25:02.860]
He's going to cost him a lot of money

[01:25:02.860 --> 01:25:03.480]
And a lot of grief

[01:25:03.480 --> 01:25:04.380]
Mark my words

[01:25:04.940 --> 01:25:06.480]
Two open lines in date, 751

[01:25:07.060 --> 01:25:09.000]
So all you assar pushes out there

[01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.140]
I love those, those are my favorite callers, man

[01:25:11.140 --> 01:25:13.200]
Yeah, you're talking too much sports

[01:25:13.200 --> 01:25:14.680]
And we don't like this way, he's a...

[01:25:14.680 --> 01:25:16.060]
Yes, so once you find something else to do

[01:25:16.060 --> 01:25:16.900]
Go play pinoccal

[01:25:16.900 --> 01:25:18.760]
Go play solitary, you should be used to it

[01:25:18.760 --> 01:25:21.040]
Go do something constructive for once in your life

[01:25:21.840 --> 01:25:24.180]
Oh my god, it's unbelievable

[01:25:24.680 --> 01:25:25.900]
And of course they won't call now

[01:25:25.900 --> 01:25:28.040]
Because then they'll say, oh we are gone, we're long gone

[01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:29.860]
And of course you're not, you're out there right now

[01:25:29.860 --> 01:25:31.660]
You're on the edge of an nervous breakdown

[01:25:32.780 --> 01:25:33.980]
751 WIOD in date

[01:25:33.980 --> 01:25:35.880]
We got two open lines on the green lines

[01:25:35.880 --> 01:25:37.660]
1-800-944-9463

[01:25:38.380 --> 01:25:40.880]
1-800-944-WIOD

[01:25:41.340 --> 01:25:43.200]
So we got Monday and Tuesday

[01:25:43.200 --> 01:25:44.900]
There's the latest that we can see right now

[01:25:44.900 --> 01:25:47.940]
Two more days, two more trips to this joint

[01:25:48.860 --> 01:25:50.800]
And then on Wednesday we hope

[01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:52.460]
That everything will be in order

[01:25:52.460 --> 01:25:54.740]
It's getting pretty close, it's pretty close

[01:25:54.740 --> 01:25:57.120]
And it's space-age, it is state of the art

[01:25:57.120 --> 01:25:58.100]
And then some

[01:25:58.100 --> 01:26:00.120]
And they got guys working around the clock over there

[01:26:00.120 --> 01:26:03.140]
And our new joint, making it, you can't even believe it

[01:26:03.140 --> 01:26:05.860]
And you'll be able to tell just by the sound of it

[01:26:05.860 --> 01:26:07.240]
Just by all the things we'll be able to do

[01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:09.860]
Here's a lady mobile in Perine, hello

[01:26:09.860 --> 01:26:11.260]
Hi Neil, how are you?

[01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:15.540]
Great, I try to get on me for but I guess that guy wasted some more time

[01:26:15.540 --> 01:26:17.960]
But I wanted to know if you heard the comment this morning

[01:26:18.520 --> 01:26:20.200]
Concerning again the Alamore incident

[01:26:20.200 --> 01:26:21.880]
But Charles got odds good report?

[01:26:22.200 --> 01:26:22.340]
No

[01:26:22.340 --> 01:26:24.220]
Okay, I thought it was pretty interesting

[01:26:24.220 --> 01:26:26.920]
Because he said that he had a way to get back

[01:26:26.920 --> 01:26:29.340]
That the umpires could get back to Alamore

[01:26:29.340 --> 01:26:32.200]
Just by letting him play but every time he got up to bat

[01:26:32.200 --> 01:26:34.660]
No matter where the picture is thrown to call it as a strike

[01:26:34.660 --> 01:26:36.200]
They've already done this with guys

[01:26:37.160 --> 01:26:38.120]
That's nothing new

[01:26:38.120 --> 01:26:40.860]
So they could do that consistently and get away with it?

[01:26:40.920 --> 01:26:41.100]
No

[01:26:41.100 --> 01:26:42.260]
They couldn't

[01:26:42.260 --> 01:26:44.220]
Because there's too much spotlight on now

[01:26:44.220 --> 01:26:44.520]
Right

[01:26:44.520 --> 01:26:48.600]
They've done it quietly in the past where they've squeezed the pictures

[01:26:48.600 --> 01:26:50.880]
Or where they've expanded the strikes on with batters

[01:26:50.880 --> 01:26:53.020]
But there are too many people watching now

[01:26:53.020 --> 01:26:56.040]
Right, but to get their point across they really could do it

[01:26:56.500 --> 01:26:59.320]
And let me say it again, they would never get away with it now

[01:26:59.320 --> 01:27:02.900]
It would create such a black mark on the umpires

[01:27:02.900 --> 01:27:05.400]
And with millions of people watching during the playoffs

[01:27:06.140 --> 01:27:07.900]
They'd never recover from it

[01:27:07.900 --> 01:27:09.560]
It was an interesting thought though

[01:27:09.560 --> 01:27:11.460]
The report was good, I thought

[01:27:11.460 --> 01:27:13.300]
I don't agree that the report is good

[01:27:13.300 --> 01:27:14.480]
First of all, it's nothing new

[01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:18.280]
And Dave Palon talks about in his book at length which was written years ago

[01:27:18.280 --> 01:27:20.080]
As much as I like Charles Osgood

[01:27:20.080 --> 01:27:22.280]
And secondly, it's unacceptable

[01:27:22.280 --> 01:27:25.340]
It's like saying, well, we're going to make a mockery of the game

[01:27:25.340 --> 01:27:28.660]
Because we're pissed off because the guy did something cruel and grotesque

[01:27:28.660 --> 01:27:29.740]
And vulgar

[01:27:29.740 --> 01:27:30.420]
Right, right

[01:27:30.420 --> 01:27:31.700]
It's just not acceptable

[01:27:31.700 --> 01:27:32.960]
Right, you're right

[01:27:32.960 --> 01:27:35.440]
Anyway, I decided to pass on the information

[01:27:35.440 --> 01:27:36.620]
Okay, sweetheart, thank you

[01:27:36.620 --> 01:27:36.980]
Have a great day

[01:27:36.980 --> 01:27:37.760]
We are too bright

[01:27:37.760 --> 01:27:42.500]
Open line at day at 7519-463-751-WYOD

[01:27:42.500 --> 01:27:49.300]
And one in Broward, 524-21-Green lines, 189-449-463-189-444

[01:27:49.300 --> 01:27:49.920]
You know the rest

[01:27:50.940 --> 01:27:51.820]
Here's Davey

[01:27:51.820 --> 01:27:52.140]
Hello

[01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:54.240]
Hey, Neil, how you doing?

[01:27:54.500 --> 01:27:54.900]
Okay, sir

[01:27:54.900 --> 01:27:57.700]
I waited for over an hour, I wanted to say a load of rimmer

[01:27:57.700 --> 01:27:58.600]
Hi, rimmer

[01:27:59.480 --> 01:28:00.060]
He's gone

[01:28:00.060 --> 01:28:03.500]
I'm a first-time caller, I wanted you to know that you got me into hockey

[01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.460]
Last season I was listening to you talk about hockey

[01:28:06.460 --> 01:28:08.320]
And decided to go down to a game

[01:28:08.320 --> 01:28:10.920]
And I've gone to about four or five games last year

[01:28:10.920 --> 01:28:11.360]
Beautiful

[01:28:11.360 --> 01:28:13.660]
And it's an incredible sport

[01:28:13.660 --> 01:28:16.020]
I'm 30 years old, I was never into hockey

[01:28:16.700 --> 01:28:20.320]
And it's so easy just to get wrapped up and it's so exciting

[01:28:20.320 --> 01:28:22.000]
Right, compared to baseball

[01:28:22.520 --> 01:28:25.280]
Which I used to be a big fan of now it's kind of gotten boring

[01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:28.320]
But hockey is just incredible

[01:28:28.320 --> 01:28:34.120]
And I just want to let you know that I just wanted to reward all the Panther fans out there

[01:28:34.120 --> 01:28:36.720]
I have a couple of restaurants one of them I think you've been to

[01:28:36.720 --> 01:28:41.220]
And I want to give 10% off to all Panther fans for the whole month of October

[01:28:41.220 --> 01:28:42.540]
Have you ever heard of the LJ Diner?

[01:28:43.260 --> 01:28:43.420]
No

[01:28:43.420 --> 01:28:46.860]
Oh, I have one in Davey and one in Margate, I thought you've been there

[01:28:46.860 --> 01:28:47.160]
No

[01:28:47.660 --> 01:28:53.380]
Well, I want to anybody out there who says their Panther fan gets 10% off for the whole month of October

[01:28:53.380 --> 01:28:58.880]
Because I'm just really in love with hockey and I just want to pump up the Panther fans out there

[01:28:58.880 --> 01:28:59.280]
Okay

[01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:01.300]
Alright, take care, Neil, you're great

[01:29:01.300 --> 01:29:01.780]
See you

[01:29:01.780 --> 01:29:02.300]
Alright, bye-bye

[01:29:02.940 --> 01:29:08.040]
Open line in Davey, 751 WIOD, we got one in Broward, 5249, 463

[01:29:08.040 --> 01:29:10.540]
And two on the green lines where you've got to reprieve again

[01:29:11.280 --> 01:29:14.680]
Boka and West Palm and all those going up there they got another reprieve

[01:29:14.680 --> 01:29:17.220]
Because once we moved into the studios we still got the green lines

[01:29:17.220 --> 01:29:20.100]
What would life be without the green lines when you come right down to it, huh?

[01:29:20.460 --> 01:29:20.800]
Plus it

[01:29:21.280 --> 01:29:23.420]
That's it, here's a mobile in Hylia, hello

[01:29:23.420 --> 01:29:24.680]
Neil, yes sir

[01:29:24.680 --> 01:29:26.800]
He's in love with the Panthers, he's in his business real bad

[01:29:26.800 --> 01:29:28.700]
Well, both, maybe one of the above

[01:29:28.700 --> 01:29:31.200]
In any case, as far as the Alamar situation

[01:29:31.200 --> 01:29:31.500]
Yeah

[01:29:32.560 --> 01:29:36.240]
I don't agree with the Umpires, I mean I don't agree with what they're doing

[01:29:36.900 --> 01:29:40.380]
But I think that what they're doing is to get their point across at that

[01:29:40.380 --> 01:29:41.820]
Something like that never happens again

[01:29:41.820 --> 01:29:44.300]
Because everybody say, well Alamar is a classy guy

[01:29:44.300 --> 01:29:46.940]
But at that moment he's not being classy

[01:29:46.940 --> 01:29:47.520]
Yeah

[01:29:47.520 --> 01:29:50.040]
I mean you're not a murderer until you murder someone

[01:29:50.040 --> 01:29:50.480]
Yeah

[01:29:50.980 --> 01:29:53.660]
And I mean you know you never see an upspinning

[01:29:53.660 --> 01:29:59.040]
I know something I don't but I still don't see what the hysteria about this is

[01:29:59.040 --> 01:30:00.300]
I mean it was a vulgar thing

[01:30:00.300 --> 01:30:03.100]
Because if somebody spit in your face you'd be freaking out too

[01:30:04.540 --> 01:30:07.200]
I wouldn't like it but it wouldn't be the end of the world

[01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:10.080]
No but I mean you do something about it if it was in your power

[01:30:10.940 --> 01:30:11.720]
Like what?

[01:30:11.980 --> 01:30:14.840]
I'm beat to crap out of me but I sure as hell wouldn't take it sitting down

[01:30:14.840 --> 01:30:15.200]
Yeah

[01:30:15.200 --> 01:30:20.880]
And like I'm saying, Umpires as a brother whatever the hell they want to call it

[01:30:20.880 --> 01:30:23.740]
Yeah and that's why you know this guy's an entertaining guy

[01:30:23.740 --> 01:30:24.840]
And I'm glad Rimmer got him on

[01:30:24.840 --> 01:30:27.680]
But I knew right up front that he's not going to knock

[01:30:27.680 --> 01:30:29.520]
He's part of the Umpire opportunity

[01:30:29.520 --> 01:30:33.060]
He's on the same crew with her spec during the regular season, the American League

[01:30:33.060 --> 01:30:35.560]
So this guy's not going to come on here and knock her her spec

[01:30:35.560 --> 01:30:36.060]
Or

[01:30:36.060 --> 01:30:38.260]
Look it's not a question of knocking anybody

[01:30:38.260 --> 01:30:42.800]
It's just that if they let this go by or if they don't make a big deal about it

[01:30:42.800 --> 01:30:45.600]
I mean how big of a deal they got to make about it?

[01:30:45.660 --> 01:30:47.760]
I don't know because I don't think they've gotten their point of view

[01:30:47.760 --> 01:30:54.260]
How much dirt does the guy have to kick in the Umpires pants or into his face or on his uniform

[01:30:54.260 --> 01:30:57.220]
Before they make a big deal about that that's been going on for years

[01:30:57.220 --> 01:31:02.420]
And I guarantee that when Leo DeRosha and Stanky and some of those guys

[01:31:02.420 --> 01:31:04.840]
And Billy Martin were face to face with Umpires

[01:31:04.840 --> 01:31:06.860]
I'll guarantee that there was saliva

[01:31:06.860 --> 01:31:08.900]
They didn't do it the way that Alamar did

[01:31:08.900 --> 01:31:11.640]
But I guarantee there was saliva flowing back and forth

[01:31:11.640 --> 01:31:12.040]
That's it

[01:31:12.040 --> 01:31:13.820]
They were right in each other's face, that's right

[01:31:13.820 --> 01:31:14.900]
And nobody ever said

[01:31:14.900 --> 01:31:19.240]
It's a bit mad when you talk but one thing is to take a correction for five in your mouth

[01:31:19.240 --> 01:31:20.480]
But he's face

[01:31:20.480 --> 01:31:22.240]
But you have better aim the way Alamar did it so

[01:31:22.240 --> 01:31:23.600]
It's just true, in any case

[01:31:25.660 --> 01:31:30.200]
I'm torn between you two, I don't think either side should hurt the game to try to get their point of view

[01:31:30.200 --> 01:31:34.320]
That's what I'm saying I think it's, let them resolve it their own way, whatever they want to do

[01:31:34.320 --> 01:31:37.660]
But stop screwing the game of baseball because it's already on its last legs

[01:31:37.660 --> 01:31:39.540]
Yeah and the fans are the ones getting screwed in the middle

[01:31:39.540 --> 01:31:40.140]
As usual

[01:31:40.140 --> 01:31:45.920]
Let's get the playoffs in the serious over and then the Alamar and Alamar and Aruman beat them up for some

[01:31:45.920 --> 01:31:47.720]
Then we don't care but just get the games going

[01:31:47.720 --> 01:31:50.560]
And closing the always ass of the discolven

[01:31:50.560 --> 01:31:53.120]
They're complaining about talking about hockey for what an hour or two

[01:31:53.120 --> 01:31:53.500]
Yeah

[01:31:53.500 --> 01:31:58.080]
Yeah, we have to always hockey fans have to put up with the bullcraft football talk in the station

[01:31:58.080 --> 01:31:59.440]
99.9% of the time

[01:31:59.440 --> 01:32:01.500]
Right, so they don't like it, they can kiss my ass

[01:32:01.500 --> 01:32:03.480]
Football and boxing man enough with it already

[01:32:03.480 --> 01:32:04.320]
Unbelievable

[01:32:04.320 --> 01:32:05.060]
Have a great day, Pat

[01:32:05.060 --> 01:32:08.700]
Two open lines and now there's a real good sport boxing

[01:32:08.700 --> 01:32:10.880]
That's a good savory sport that all you guys could enjoy

[01:32:10.880 --> 01:32:13.780]
The ones that you can all bend out of shape about somebody spitting in the umpire's face

[01:32:13.780 --> 01:32:17.460]
There is a good savory sport with nothing but really respectable people involved

[01:32:17.460 --> 01:32:20.180]
Both in the ring and outside people like Don King

[01:32:20.700 --> 01:32:24.500]
People who never stole a freight train real good fights that look real fishy at best

[01:32:24.500 --> 01:32:26.300]
And ripping you off from your heart or in money

[01:32:26.300 --> 01:32:28.140]
But hey, nobody cares about that

[01:32:30.200 --> 01:32:32.440]
751 WIOD we got two open lines in date

[01:32:32.440 --> 01:32:33.960]
Here's a lady mobile in Coral Springs

[01:32:33.960 --> 01:32:34.320]
Hello

[01:32:34.320 --> 01:32:35.140]
Hi Neil

[01:32:35.140 --> 01:32:35.940]
Yes ma'am

[01:32:35.940 --> 01:32:39.120]
I wanted to weigh in on the Robert Roberto Alamar situation

[01:32:39.120 --> 01:32:39.900]
Oh, here we go

[01:32:39.900 --> 01:32:42.920]
Well, there's one thing I don't understand and I heard an interview

[01:32:42.920 --> 01:32:43.320]
Way away

[01:32:43.320 --> 01:32:48.160]
I heard an interview with Doug Steele, the commissioner, or acting

[01:32:48.160 --> 01:32:49.620]
Yeah, the make believe commission right

[01:32:49.620 --> 01:32:54.400]
I know, but why are the umpires like you said making such a big deal about it

[01:32:54.400 --> 01:33:00.380]
When they know full well that the contract between the last labor agreement

[01:33:00.380 --> 01:33:02.260]
The rules very clear

[01:33:02.260 --> 01:33:05.020]
They don't get suspended playoff games

[01:33:05.020 --> 01:33:07.000]
It's only for regular season games

[01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:07.220]
Right

[01:33:07.220 --> 01:33:11.500]
He always got no authority to suspend him for the playoff

[01:33:11.500 --> 01:33:13.660]
And they know that they can't go out on strike anyway

[01:33:13.660 --> 01:33:18.100]
And right, and which Jimmy you heard Jim McKinja say before he knew that they were going to have to go back to work

[01:33:18.100 --> 01:33:19.660]
Right, so what are they doing this?

[01:33:19.700 --> 01:33:23.120]
They're trying to win public sympathy as if it really makes any difference

[01:33:23.120 --> 01:33:24.880]
I mean, what's the point?

[01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:25.940]
What difference does it make?

[01:33:25.940 --> 01:33:27.220]
What side the public is on?

[01:33:27.320 --> 01:33:28.780]
Yeah, we have no influence over it either

[01:33:28.780 --> 01:33:30.280]
We want to see baseball

[01:33:30.280 --> 01:33:30.560]
Right

[01:33:30.560 --> 01:33:31.720]
We want to see major plays

[01:33:31.720 --> 01:33:34.700]
Those people are interested in it now during the playoffs in the series

[01:33:34.700 --> 01:33:36.320]
Those people want to see the games

[01:33:36.320 --> 01:33:37.860]
They don't give a crap about this anymore

[01:33:37.860 --> 01:33:40.400]
And a lot of the people who are all worked up about this

[01:33:40.400 --> 01:33:43.660]
Are people who keep seeing this on Channel 7, 10 million times an hour

[01:33:43.660 --> 01:33:46.540]
And so right away their experts and it's something for them to talk about

[01:33:46.540 --> 01:33:48.120]
And they're not even baseball fans

[01:33:48.120 --> 01:33:50.300]
I don't care who's calling the balls and strikes

[01:33:50.300 --> 01:33:52.220]
Take the college umpires and put them up there

[01:33:52.220 --> 01:33:53.060]
They can call the game

[01:33:53.060 --> 01:33:55.540]
No, I don't agree with that

[01:33:55.540 --> 01:33:58.120]
You don't play a 162 game season to get to the playoffs

[01:33:58.120 --> 01:33:59.860]
So you can make a mockery out of the game

[01:33:59.860 --> 01:34:02.900]
We all know that they have to go to work

[01:34:03.540 --> 01:34:04.740]
There's no choice in the matter

[01:34:04.740 --> 01:34:06.140]
They find a no strike agreement

[01:34:06.140 --> 01:34:07.120]
Right and they're going

[01:34:07.120 --> 01:34:09.580]
And of course they were going and they knew the score would say they're going

[01:34:09.580 --> 01:34:12.900]
They're not going to suspend Alamore for the playoffs because they can't

[01:34:12.900 --> 01:34:13.040]
Yeah

[01:34:13.040 --> 01:34:15.120]
So you know, let's get on with the game

[01:34:15.120 --> 01:34:16.060]
Right, amen

[01:34:16.060 --> 01:34:17.280]
I'm with you

[01:34:17.840 --> 01:34:18.400]
Thanks Phil

[01:34:18.400 --> 01:34:19.200]
Okay, see ya

[01:34:19.200 --> 01:34:22.160]
Yeah, let's get this stuff going and cut the crap already

[01:34:22.160 --> 01:34:25.660]
Now you people are so psychotic because somebody's spitting somebody's face

[01:34:25.660 --> 01:34:31.860]
One of the mildest defenses that can happen in America on a regular basis in a country where people shoot each other over a parking spot

[01:34:32.440 --> 01:34:34.220]
Where we have drive-by shootings

[01:34:34.220 --> 01:34:35.660]
Nobody cares about that

[01:34:35.660 --> 01:34:38.100]
But boy somebody's spitting somebody's face

[01:34:38.100 --> 01:34:39.460]
Now you're talking

[01:34:39.460 --> 01:34:41.900]
Now you're really getting me pissed off baby

[01:34:43.640 --> 01:34:44.420]
Uh oh

[01:34:44.960 --> 01:34:46.560]
Right, back at you

[01:34:47.560 --> 01:34:48.520]
Boy, oh boy

[01:34:48.520 --> 01:34:51.160]
What an echo like I said yesterday and I'll repeat it again today

[01:34:51.160 --> 01:34:53.800]
The public gets caught up in whatever the hype is

[01:34:53.800 --> 01:34:58.840]
Whatever the media gets everybody whipped up into a frenzy about whether it's OJ whether it's a spit non-era

[01:34:58.840 --> 01:35:05.500]
Puss whatever it is the public just dutifully comes along like a bunch like this is the most important devastating thing that's ever happened

[01:35:05.500 --> 01:35:11.440]
In the meantime the people at the NTSB and everybody else keeps lying every day and holding press conferences

[01:35:11.440 --> 01:35:15.480]
And lying about this plane that went down all these people that got killed nobody cares about that

[01:35:16.420 --> 01:35:20.400]
And let me tell you Robert Francis take your bald headed push and give it a rest already

[01:35:20.400 --> 01:35:23.440]
We're sick and tired of seeing you and all these BS stories already will you?

[01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:24.440]
God

[01:35:24.900 --> 01:35:28.900]
Just like I told you you'll never hear the real story from your government about that deal

[01:35:30.840 --> 01:35:32.260]
115 and WI would

[01:35:32.800 --> 01:35:34.460]
Talkin' entertainment radio

[01:35:35.500 --> 01:35:36.400]
610 WI OD

[01:35:38.880 --> 01:35:40.040]
Rick Riley, I'm sorry

[01:35:40.700 --> 01:35:46.220]
117 and WI, hey well listen I'm not you know, Adam's in here already getting into a big, a verbal battle with everybody on behalf

[01:35:46.220 --> 01:35:48.060]
Yeah, let Rick fight his own fights, okay?

[01:35:48.480 --> 01:35:53.620]
And I was wrong about that the pull we took you that a rumor grew at least a tiny pair before Rick ever even thought about it

[01:35:54.020 --> 01:36:00.560]
He's got to be upset, well too bad we got a project to do okay here mister and we got a grab it by our own hands because we got nobody directing it

[01:36:00.980 --> 01:36:02.200]
You know what I'm talking about?

[01:36:02.740 --> 01:36:04.200]
We got nobody directing it

[01:36:04.200 --> 01:36:05.280]
Here's Stuart, hello

[01:36:05.280 --> 01:36:06.120]
Mr. Rogers

[01:36:06.120 --> 01:36:07.340]
Yes sir, from Stuart sir

[01:36:07.340 --> 01:36:09.760]
Bad connection boy you got a bad hum on his phone

[01:36:09.760 --> 01:36:11.020]
It's raining pouring up here

[01:36:11.020 --> 01:36:15.900]
Okay, I heard the tail end that it's directing me, it does have the panthers or

[01:36:15.900 --> 01:36:23.380]
It's coming either tomorrow or very soon, but it's coming so upgrade now I would want the panthers say buy a truck going by

[01:36:23.880 --> 01:36:25.160]
Good A-camers, the riders

[01:36:25.160 --> 01:36:26.820]
Okay, good phone

[01:36:26.820 --> 01:36:29.240]
Wow, what a hum job on that phone

[01:36:29.840 --> 01:36:34.740]
Open line on the green line 1-800-944-9463, here's a Tamarack hello

[01:36:36.320 --> 01:36:36.760]
Tamarack

[01:36:37.800 --> 01:36:41.900]
Gone, Tamarack is gone, that's good, that's a good empty spot on the map, good place for it

[01:36:41.900 --> 01:36:45.040]
Open line of Broward 524, here's Miami, hello

[01:36:45.040 --> 01:36:46.520]
Hey, Neil, yes sir

[01:36:47.040 --> 01:36:48.840]
Hey, I live open, Pemberpines

[01:36:48.840 --> 01:36:49.500]
Yeah

[01:36:50.040 --> 01:36:51.940]
And we have ICS up there

[01:36:51.940 --> 01:36:52.720]
You have what?

[01:36:53.240 --> 01:36:54.520]
ICS, are you here in there?

[01:36:54.820 --> 01:36:55.480]
What the hell is that?

[01:36:55.560 --> 01:36:55.760]
Able

[01:36:56.200 --> 01:36:57.100]
Never heard of it

[01:36:57.100 --> 01:37:00.500]
Yeah, well they've never heard of the panthers either because we don't have it

[01:37:02.060 --> 01:37:02.940]
And ICS

[01:37:02.940 --> 01:37:05.820]
ICS, I have the other number right here

[01:37:05.820 --> 01:37:06.180]
Yeah

[01:37:06.780 --> 01:37:09.220]
And I thought Pemberpines was all TCI

[01:37:09.700 --> 01:37:11.800]
Well, that's our other choice

[01:37:11.800 --> 01:37:13.340]
What do you mean your other choice?

[01:37:13.340 --> 01:37:16.960]
We have either TCI or ICS

[01:37:16.960 --> 01:37:19.740]
I never heard of ICS, I don't think anybody else did eat it

[01:37:19.740 --> 01:37:22.720]
I don't know if they're affiliated or what, but I ate it with what?

[01:37:22.860 --> 01:37:23.600]
With TCI

[01:37:23.600 --> 01:37:24.340]
I sure doubted

[01:37:25.760 --> 01:37:32.960]
Well, I don't know, but they, I called them and they didn't know anything about anything, it sounded like they didn't know anything about anything

[01:37:32.960 --> 01:37:35.300]
Well, that's good, you have a good time with them

[01:37:35.300 --> 01:37:39.120]
Open line in day 751, oh brother, brother, brother

[01:37:39.120 --> 01:37:41.420]
What about Antonio about cable for years, huh?

[01:37:41.880 --> 01:37:44.720]
And all of a sudden you're getting stuck at, oh, what are we doing now?

[01:37:44.720 --> 01:37:45.740]
You're crying on my shoulder

[01:37:45.740 --> 01:37:49.160]
Like I haven't been telling you about this for like ever, forever and ever and ever

[01:37:50.960 --> 01:37:52.680]
Here's Davey on the purple line, hello

[01:37:52.680 --> 01:37:53.920]
Hey, how are you?

[01:37:54.060 --> 01:37:54.380]
Okay

[01:37:54.380 --> 01:37:56.920]
Hey, this is only 19 minutes, that's pretty good

[01:37:57.560 --> 01:37:58.400]
19 minute wait?

[01:37:58.740 --> 01:37:59.140]
Yeah

[01:37:59.140 --> 01:38:02.180]
Not bad, yeah, well we think out and start it over again, top of the hour

[01:38:02.180 --> 01:38:06.920]
Hey, well listen, let me just, it'll be a little suck up action later for you

[01:38:06.920 --> 01:38:11.680]
But all baseball needs to do is extend a debate, losing another couple thousand fans per stadium

[01:38:12.500 --> 01:38:13.260]
Say what?

[01:38:13.860 --> 01:38:17.700]
All baseball needs to do is extend a debate a little longer

[01:38:17.700 --> 01:38:22.460]
Right, and that's right, and they can, and they can, they can, they can just shut down altogether, you're right

[01:38:22.460 --> 01:38:31.060]
I mean, you know, last year's strike, what did that do to the baseball and, and then you just, just about put it in the, in the, in the, at the end of the rope

[01:38:31.060 --> 01:38:32.800]
These people are real intelligence

[01:38:32.800 --> 01:38:33.200]
Yeah

[01:38:33.200 --> 01:38:38.940]
So I gotta say, and the suck up action is that, you know, sports is at least 25 to 30% of the entertainment in this town

[01:38:38.940 --> 01:38:44.720]
So what you're doing is just following what the people want to listen to and what they want to get involved in

[01:38:44.720 --> 01:38:51.640]
And I remember last year, a year ago, how you let the, Mr.'s event, and go on and on about the OGL trial

[01:38:51.640 --> 01:38:55.800]
And you're just simply following what the, what the listeners and what everybody wants to talk about

[01:38:55.800 --> 01:38:59.860]
Let me sit again right now, this is the high-item, you're allowing them to talk

[01:38:59.860 --> 01:39:05.960]
And what I've done for years and years, you know, what I try to do, it doesn't work all the time, but what I try to do is talk about whatever is going on

[01:39:05.960 --> 01:39:09.980]
And right now, what Jim Leland-Coloured in town has been a Marlon manager today

[01:39:09.980 --> 01:39:13.980]
With the OMPIRE's having threatened to walk out, with the Panther season starting tomorrow night

[01:39:14.400 --> 01:39:16.960]
You know, with all this other stuff going on, this is what's happening

[01:39:16.960 --> 01:39:20.580]
Hey, listen, there's baseball, Erickson's gonna get a shot of quarterback

[01:39:20.580 --> 01:39:21.860]
There's a wide deal going on

[01:39:28.900 --> 01:39:29.840]
Right, that's right

[01:39:29.840 --> 01:39:31.860]
And they ought to take a lesson from you

[01:39:31.860 --> 01:39:36.240]
Well, and from Rimmer, see this is the guy they don't want over there because they're intimidated by him

[01:39:36.240 --> 01:39:39.640]
He's got, he knows, you could tell it, they know each other very well

[01:39:39.640 --> 01:39:44.060]
He knows all the people in sports, not just in hockey, but in baseball and football, basketball

[01:39:44.060 --> 01:39:46.880]
He knows them all personally, he's got everybody's home phone number

[01:39:46.880 --> 01:39:51.160]
You know, he just had George pick up the phone, here call his number, here's the guy in the phone in two seconds

[01:39:51.160 --> 01:39:56.460]
And why anybody wouldn't want a guy like this, unless they're threatened by them, is a very sad comment

[01:39:56.460 --> 01:40:00.060]
So the fat slob can sit over there and keep mouthing off all he wants in QAM

[01:40:00.060 --> 01:40:02.940]
If you really want to hear what's going on, you got to go to somewhere else

[01:40:03.440 --> 01:40:06.420]
And you know, you do a great job, thanks for being around

[01:40:06.420 --> 01:40:07.780]
Okay pal, have a great day

[01:40:08.160 --> 01:40:11.480]
Open line on the purple line, pound IOD, what are you doing Adam, you're getting me upset

[01:40:11.480 --> 01:40:13.100]
Get me upset

[01:40:14.280 --> 01:40:18.580]
Oh, so in other words, you're going to come in here every day at this time and pull Rick's spots for him

[01:40:18.580 --> 01:40:20.580]
You're going to come in here and pull it

[01:40:21.220 --> 01:40:23.800]
Oh my God, Brackdom Jesus

[01:40:25.880 --> 01:40:31.260]
I don't understand that, isn't that kind of a bizarre situation? You never did this before?

[01:40:32.660 --> 01:40:35.720]
Not in the afternoon, of course you weren't producing that show when they were on the afternoon

[01:40:36.260 --> 01:40:37.980]
Did Randy show in the afternoon for a week?

[01:40:38.180 --> 01:40:39.480]
Yeah, and did you pull her spots?

[01:40:39.900 --> 01:40:40.700]
She didn't have any

[01:40:40.700 --> 01:40:42.000]
Oh, that's a good point

[01:40:43.140 --> 01:40:45.560]
Here's a mobile in Fort Lauderdale, hello

[01:40:45.560 --> 01:40:48.320]
Speaking of Shotty, I'm firing, did you see the game last night?

[01:40:48.460 --> 01:40:48.920]
Yes I did

[01:40:51.680 --> 01:40:56.620]
The second out there that called Strike 3 with about four feet outside the strike zone

[01:40:56.620 --> 01:40:57.620]
Did you see that?

[01:40:57.700 --> 01:41:01.640]
Well he was making up for the one he called on Clasco earlier in the game that was six feet outside

[01:41:01.640 --> 01:41:03.480]
Remember when Ryan Clasco got in his face?

[01:41:03.560 --> 01:41:04.700]
No, I only watched the end of it

[01:41:04.700 --> 01:41:08.180]
Oh, he called on us Strike that, well you couldn't hit with a seven iron

[01:41:08.180 --> 01:41:10.020]
Yeah, it's unreal, it's unreal

[01:41:10.020 --> 01:41:14.060]
I enjoyed baseball this time of year, I couldn't give a crap less about it during the regular season

[01:41:14.060 --> 01:41:15.720]
And neither could most other people

[01:41:15.720 --> 01:41:22.380]
Right, I think I've got a good idea for Joe Robbie and the pro player Park next year

[01:41:22.380 --> 01:41:30.460]
When baseball starts, call up Channel 10, I'm sure they've got some of Joey Reynolds' audience standing around there somewhere

[01:41:32.060 --> 01:41:33.240]
Hardboard crowd baby

[01:41:33.240 --> 01:41:33.900]
Can you imagine?

[01:41:34.080 --> 01:41:35.480]
Sure looks better in those orange seats

[01:41:35.480 --> 01:41:38.260]
Listen to me, there's one thing that you gotta play

[01:41:38.260 --> 01:41:38.780]
Yeah

[01:41:38.780 --> 01:41:43.680]
And I love it and it sends it all up and down my spine

[01:41:43.680 --> 01:41:45.460]
Oh, you get chills in your rectum

[01:41:46.140 --> 01:41:47.660]
Play by play on the radio

[01:41:47.660 --> 01:41:49.100]
Oh, get out of here

[01:41:49.100 --> 01:41:51.640]
You just heard that other guy say that now

[01:41:51.640 --> 01:41:52.280]
No, no, no, I'll play

[01:41:52.280 --> 01:41:54.960]
Everybody's got chills in their rectum now from my play by play

[01:41:54.960 --> 01:41:58.860]
I don't wanna wait, I'm in my car, it's betraying like hell over here

[01:41:58.860 --> 01:42:02.520]
Oh, you don't wanna wait, now he's gonna tell me what to play and when to play it

[01:42:02.520 --> 01:42:03.940]
I want it now, man

[01:42:03.940 --> 01:42:05.640]
Don't we all

[01:42:05.640 --> 01:42:07.360]
Hey, and the card too

[01:42:07.360 --> 01:42:07.720]
Yeah

[01:42:07.720 --> 01:42:09.380]
Play it, God damn it

[01:42:09.380 --> 01:42:11.640]
But I think you just blew it

[01:42:11.640 --> 01:42:12.360]
No, I didn't

[01:42:13.880 --> 01:42:15.120]
Say I'm sorry

[01:42:15.120 --> 01:42:17.320]
I'm sorry, miss it, I'm very, very sorry

[01:42:17.320 --> 01:42:18.840]
I'm very effing sorry

[01:42:18.840 --> 01:42:20.360]
Okay, now it's better

[01:42:21.140 --> 01:42:23.160]
Okay, he didn't say what you thought he said or just

[01:42:23.600 --> 01:42:26.980]
We have an open line of Broward, 5249463

[01:42:26.980 --> 01:42:28.940]
These people, boy, I'll tell you one thing

[01:42:28.940 --> 01:42:32.480]
You won't find, you can't complain about pushing people in South Florida, man

[01:42:32.480 --> 01:42:33.320]
Because you sure are

[01:42:33.320 --> 01:42:36.100]
Play by play on the radio

[01:42:37.240 --> 01:42:39.060]
Play by play

[01:42:39.060 --> 01:42:43.420]
The one who's being kidnapped, back for sure, we go back, back, back, back, back, back

[01:42:43.420 --> 01:42:46.460]
He makes a one handed catcher against the Wolfman

[01:42:47.060 --> 01:42:48.340]
Oh, it's not that

[01:42:48.340 --> 01:42:50.740]
Now I'm a fortune in the summer

[01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:56.000]
The sound of the southern voice still streaming

[01:42:56.000 --> 01:43:01.200]
Me and the red head were up in the counter scene

[01:43:04.580 --> 01:43:08.460]
And out in San Luis for sure, they're the same

[01:43:08.460 --> 01:43:12.720]
Holy cow would have faced fall game

[01:43:12.720 --> 01:43:18.080]
But the sacks loaded and here comes that man again

[01:43:20.500 --> 01:43:24.700]
And if it's played by play on the radio

[01:43:25.460 --> 01:43:29.240]
Play by play on the radio

[01:43:29.240 --> 01:43:34.380]
Play by play, I saw it on the radio

[01:43:38.460 --> 01:43:41.900]
The swing of the splinter to Maggio's life

[01:43:42.460 --> 01:43:45.620]
The man and Mike's made it come alive

[01:43:46.600 --> 01:43:51.460]
Bernie and Mel and Bob was the prince of the guy

[01:43:55.460 --> 01:43:58.480]
Out of thin air pictures somehow appear

[01:43:58.480 --> 01:44:03.040]
You can smell the hot dawn and taste the beer

[01:44:03.040 --> 01:44:09.100]
Tell the excitement as the crowd begins to cheer

[01:44:10.680 --> 01:44:14.800]
And it was play by play on the radio

[01:44:14.800 --> 01:44:19.320]
Play by play on the radio

[01:44:19.320 --> 01:44:24.580]
Play by play, I saw it on the radio

[01:44:25.960 --> 01:44:30.820]
Play by play, I saw it on the radio

[01:44:31.560 --> 01:44:32.540]
It was a score!

[01:44:32.860 --> 01:44:34.480]
Kissed a wife, did not hate!

[01:44:35.020 --> 01:44:36.440]
Got the club prize, holigt!

[01:44:37.560 --> 01:44:38.120]
In том, does a Vocor—

[01:44:38.120 --> 01:44:39.220]
Smoked ice gibi, and soda

[01:44:39.220 --> 01:44:44.480]
Xiangleckus, swing his little dogads

[01:44:44.480 --> 01:44:45.380]
The field ran to the night battlefield

[01:44:45.380 --> 01:44:47.160]
Going back back back to school

[01:44:47.160 --> 01:44:49.760]
Lay back and sends the fight on the loop from home

[01:44:49.760 --> 01:44:54.880]
A man and Mike's made it come alive

[01:44:55.720 --> 01:44:57.820]
Flew into myczech

[01:44:57.820 --> 01:45:01.680]
And long on track, turn it up louder

[01:45:01.680 --> 01:45:04.820]
If the coaches are coming by

[01:45:07.820 --> 01:45:11.320]
And it's play by play on the radio

[01:45:11.320 --> 01:45:15.800]
Play by play on the radio

[01:45:15.800 --> 01:45:22.600]
Play by play, just a dance dance

[01:45:32.540 --> 01:45:46.600]
Play by play, just a dance dance

[01:46:01.120 --> 01:46:16.580]
Play by play on the radio

[01:46:16.600 --> 01:46:24.800]
Play by play on the radio
