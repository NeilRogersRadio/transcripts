Well, the negative things about right about the show are I don't care for the payphone challenge

[00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:28.240]
Okay, and also when Neil Rogers comes on it's such a different demeanor to you

[00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:31.780]

I know I did not know anything about her getting married in it in addition in addition to which she and Jim have been living together for how many years

[00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:19.740]
So was it like a big deal that she got married or like some major announcement in addition to which if I did know about it

[00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:20.660]
I wouldn't have called her anyway

[00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:24.740]
I can't my arm is long enough to hold a phone that far away from my ear anymore

[00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:26.500]
She's still waiting for the wedding present

[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:32.940]

Talk about a death wish. I have no idea what that whole thing is all about

[00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:44.620]
And I don't think they do

[00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:49.600]
In regards to in regards to anything. I just I just don't know what that is

[00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:53.940]
I don't understand it relationship. How can you understand any very bizarre? Yeah, right

[00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:56.200]
Yeah, most are

[00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:57.140]
Okay

[00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:22.180]
Hey, hey, did when that kneel comes on with that filthy mouth of his

[00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:29.780]
Don't you old far its understand we know you're gonna be there and you're still gonna be there at 1005 and at 1105 until you croak

[00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:35.000]
You'll be out there, but why do you lie? It's probably probably most most most no seriously like Pearl

[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:40.260]
She's probably close to a meeting her maker if she believes in any of that crap. Why doesn't she stop lying?

[00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:43.320]
I mean she's like guaranteeing herself a line in purgatory

[00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:45.920]
She

[00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:47.000]
May have just bit the

[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:52.080]
Take a number Pearl along with Mark and then the other one that made me in the supermarket take a number sweet heart

[00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:57.940]
Met you in a super mark. She started to say that in the lightning struck Lucristo came down. I

[00:13:57.940 --> 00:14:01.780]
Love that song. Yeah. Oh, I don't know why per say together together

[00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:04.020]
Let's go to I know

[00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:09.040]
That's well, that's a stretch man. It's a great song. It's one of my all-time favorite song

[00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:12.640]
Absolutely you can I never heard that song was on wk and rnd troid

[00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:19.680]
I was driving with my chief engineer from Kalamazoo to Detroit. Yeah, and Jim Jeffries who did the overnight show and Detroit was playing lightning strikes by

[00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:21.320]
Lucristo on Kener 13th

[00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:24.700]
It's a great song. It was probably one of the great rock stations in history of the industry

[00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:29.380]
In Detroit in Southfield no, not in wherever it was deer born

[00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:36.220]
You know do you remember when we were sitting in the office at WKXY in Sarasota and we used to go to like those little music meetings

[00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:40.320]
And he would play little samples for us and he put on the night the lights went out in Georgia

[00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:46.640]
And I hated that song. I said forget it. It'll never happen and we walked out for some reason I started whistling. He said

[00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:51.820]
It's on as soon as I started whistling it it was like on it was an instant hit

[00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:55.580]
I hated it for some reason and I don't know what brought that up. What does that have to do with me?

[00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:58.360]
I don't know. It's just like trickled my it trickled my my

[00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:05.760]
Electrifying story. I had about Kener 13 in Detroit and you're talking about the LK and in Sarasota

[00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:11.120]
Jeb was speaking of things that died that stink in

[00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:15.180]
You know in Sarasota we were on City Island right there on the bay. Yeah, and

[00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:21.820]
A mouse or a rat got in the transmitter one time and got fried. Yeah, and boy for like weeks and months

[00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:29.500]
You talk about a stench fried rat allarange man. It was the skull you remember at Y&D in fact buddy bud owned it then

[00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:34.300]
I think you were working there for a while two weeks. Yeah, we got paid either but there were two cheap

[00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:42.660]
The transmitter on a on a chassis. They just had the components laying on the floor. Yeah, well that wasn't a snake crawled in there one afternoon

[00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:44.820]
I told you there were a snake sitting outside

[00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:47.900]
But I think the work one more now a big day that was yesterday

[00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:53.960]
No, I'm not talking about in Bob Green's office. I talk about the rest of the afternoon. Oh, we're supposed to call Bob Doherb

[00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:57.640]
So I'll tell you okay. Yeah, very amusing. Did you

[00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:02.940]
Do you have a grease thing a grease container a grease trap a jar like we were talking about? Oh

[00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:10.360]
grease thing yeah now you don't for what what do you do with grease when you fry something on the stove? What do you do with the grease?

[00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:13.380]
Uh, I don't fry anything on a stove never

[00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:20.640]
Once in a blue moon and what I do is I take liquid detergent and put it in there like dissolve it and put it down the thing the sink

[00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:24.040]
Yeah, I'm the disposal like anybody else does not anybody else

[00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:27.420]
I knew back in the days when I was cooking stuff like that

[00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:32.280]
I just have a jar with grease in it right that's what brought that up. What do I do with the jar if you ever smell that?

[00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:34.620]
I don't put it in the refrigerator. No, no

[00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:38.340]
You seal it up and you put it under the sink exactly as far as is

[00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:43.040]
But when you go to use it after it's like half full that's the rink you know a red nice door that don't you?

[00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:49.800]
What do they do? Well put it on string beans no bacon grease sometimes they put it on something that might look like a stain. Oh, I see

[00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:54.660]
Oh really? It's cheaper than lard. Let's go to and lachyper and Vaseline Miami Beach. Hello

[00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:59.060]
Back at you can hardly a pay phone. Yeah, though worst

[00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:01.060]
Can't yeah

[00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:06.760]
That's okay. Yeah, just wanted to say regarding who doesn't news. Yeah, I

[00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:08.260]
For the Rick and such show I

[00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:11.820]
I say why not Jackie Quinn. I think she does a good job

[00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:13.840]
I think the show you had a

[00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:17.340]
Earlier in the week where she got mom by her dog

[00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:22.520]
She got mom by her job as long as she's getting involved by an animal

[00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:28.500]
But you don't understand Rick hates Jackie Quinn really? Yeah. What's wrong with her? I don't hate Jackie Quinn. Yes

[00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:34.340]
You do okay. I just Pfizer. Uh-huh. Well, how did he feel about Chuck Meyer? He loves Chuck Meyer

[00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:37.860]
He's got a blow up doll at home. It's got one of those little O-shaped mouths

[00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:41.840]
It's not possible that they could just like have like a sort of bluff easily. Well, you know like me

[00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:45.400]
Yeah, like maybe she could wear a Chuck Meyer mask. That would be good like a bag

[00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:50.620]
Okay, he said something about having the news called in remote from Holland and

[00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:52.280]
Something about a finger in the dice

[00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:56.060]
Thanks, pal. All right. Let's go to Miami. Hello

[00:17:56.060 --> 00:18:01.400]
If you can if you can imagine John Candy's arteries you should see the sewers in high a Leah

[00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:04.700]
Because they use so much cooking oil and it goes right down the drain

[00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:11.140]
Yeah, and literally there's a problem because it solidifies in the sewers. I hadn't thought about that it hardens

[00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:14.640]
Yeah, that's one of the reasons why you don't pour oil down the drain because you end up with like

[00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:20.280]
Something between Plato and you know you may have the analogy of the day too because John candy's been dead so long

[00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:22.220]
It was a nice reach. Yeah, isn't it? Yes

[00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:24.920]
Well, I mean it's probably I mean next would be like Sebastian Cabot

[00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:28.640]
That's the really big three-dimensional oil and the in the jacquery on you know, yeah

[00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:32.480]
Okay, well, thanks for pointing that out. Let's go to

[00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:34.160]
Yeah, mobile

[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:35.440]
Hello

[00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:42.740]
Hey, hello sir. Hello. That's Friday everybody a little slow on the draw today speak. Yeah, I guess we are

[00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:45.740]
Custom weight and I guess but I'm not complaining

[00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:53.180]
You'd never do the 13th and back at us and happy rush your shot at two pal. Yeah, you do

[00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:55.460]
Okay

That smell but yeah

[00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:02.680]
I'm sorry for you. I don't know if it ranks up with the rest of years, but

[00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:08.020]
Well, right. They're going down. Yeah, I had to go out of town for about a week and

[00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:11.600]
Either the night before I left or the day I left sometime

[00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:16.840]
Lightning hit my freezer and the freezer is in the garage. Yeah, boy

[00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:21.540]
About three days later. I got a call from my daughter who was coming in to feed animal

[00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:27.020]
She says I don't know if smells like one of the animals died, but they're all still eating and none of them really smell bad

[00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:30.840]
Yeah, but it ain't seen mom lately. Yeah, she was with me. Oh

[00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:37.920]
So I'm like home I couldn't figure out what was smelling so bad, but boy. It was really really bad

[00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:41.020]
So you went your meat went bad on you huh? Well, I bet

[00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:42.900]

Oh, it was pretty bad. Yeah, freezer full of fish after a while

[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:55.900]
Yeah, it's like when you walk into a supermarket and where maybe they've had a power out or something or the seafood laying around too long

[00:19:55.900 --> 00:20:01.440]
Everybody has smelled that. Oh brother. I don't know if they smelled it after a week. Oh

[00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:07.220]
God pretty dog on bad anyway, listen guys. You were talking about paying a dollar for a caller. Yes, sir

[00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:09.220]

[00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:44.080]
The diary is getting spelled out absolutely. You know if you were on a ballot. I'd be voting for you

[00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:22.200]
So what's wrong with the new Roger Thorpe? Why is everybody all freaked out? He's finally acting like a nice guy

[00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:24.260]

Okay 108 at ww. I would be happy friday happy new year happy rosa Lopez day on friday the 13th which is officially

[00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:56.700]
sinister

[00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:58.220]
It's an oldman

[00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:03.800]
Speaking of old people by the way. Thanks so much to all the old farts that called us morning the three or four of them anyway

[00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:10.020]
We can't stand when you come on that show. Why don't you come on at 10 o'clock then we'll listen to you

[00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:12.240]
Yeah, cuz you're listening right now are you fooling somebody?

[00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:15.400]
Are you yanking our chain you think that for one second?

[00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:21.660]
I believe that any of those people are not listening right now like hanging right under the age of their colostomy bag and squeezing it real tight

[00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:27.200]
As their teeth are fizzing louder than ever when I'd glass in the back of the room. Who are you kidding man?

[00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:30.080]
So how about that hockey game last night?

[00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:33.680]
I'll three to two and then of course a couple empty netters at the end which made it five to two

[00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:39.780]
But the final score didn't reflect the intensity the history of the game Curtis Joseph and my gricketer incredible in goal

[00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:44.520]
All kinds of scoring chances all kinds of goalpost being hit there which helped ricketer out by the way

[00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:46.480]
And this is the way it should be

[00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:48.600]
You know if the thing would end at last night

[00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:52.380]
I mean it's anti-climactic two quick games in your out you have to have the best of three

[00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:57.000]
And so now it sets it up for tomorrow night at eight in Montreal game of three in the world cup

[00:23:57.780 --> 00:24:02.560]
And uh, you know, I wasn't really a root and hard for Canada last night even in spite of that one twerp

[00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:05.360]
That called the other day especially when I found out he don't know hockey from his ass

[00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:08.220]
He wouldn't know Merritt Steerheim from Merritt Doki that guy

[00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:16.720]
Is that great that we have like some new blood in there that sees your odious has a step to side that we have Merritt Steerheim back to kick around again

[00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:20.760]
Another old crony another old flunky. Why do we bring back Steve Clark?

[00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:23.920]
That's what I say. Let's make him the ahead honcho with this town

[00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:25.740]
Then there's a thing in a herald here

[00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:31.920]
No vote for the new data arena would delight broward and might cost the county three million dollars might cost the money

[00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:36.560]
If the public if the public rejects the plan like there's some doubt here

[00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:41.580]
But the best article of all about this and by the way Dave Hyde you're on heavy drugs man

[00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:42.580]
I don't know what's wrong with you

[00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:45.480]
What's happened to you that thing about Mickey Harrison which I'll get to eventually

[00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:46.940]
Oh my god

[00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:49.380]
Dave Hyde I think is the anti-Christ

[00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:52.620]
Ritter steps away from the fray

[00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:58.020]
Tony Ritter chairman of nightritter and a key architect of the arena financing plan and date said Thursday

[00:24:58.020 --> 00:25:03.760]
He will no longer take an active role in the arena debate nightritter owns the herald no no no doubt

[00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:07.560]
I'm planning on fading into the background. He said in an interview

[00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:13.840]
He said the change in role was triggered by the successive Dan Paul's petition drive now that it's a political campaign

[00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:15.560]
I really can't be active he said

[00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:19.800]
Ritter said it would be inappropriate for nightritter to participate in the election campaign

[00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:21.900]
I do have a strong interest in the arena

[00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:24.200]
He said but I'm not going to have any kind of leadership role

[00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:29.020]
Right like there wasn't a conflict of interest in the first place like there always was with a herald where they use their new

[00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:33.580]
News pages to propaganda and try to put crap over on the public like the metro rail

[00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:38.160]
Anybody remember the way they sold us to metro rail and it seems to me that mirror it's still high

[00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:41.040]
I'm with the county manager back then in date county wasn't he?

[00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:47.500]
Oh my god, but now it's the a great elder statesman mirrored steerheim is coming back to save the city of Miami right

[00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:53.040]
What what is uh what kind of letters are those on there? What is that all about?

[00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:57.260]
Is that a new deal that we're liking in this leftovers in lowercase? Hello

[00:25:58.240 --> 00:25:59.120]
Purple line

[00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:01.260]
Hello speak to me

[00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:04.340]
Neil yes, sir. This is iron. How you doing?

[00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:07.020]
Oh

[00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:10.200]
Oh god, oh god. I just wanted to let you know that uh

[00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:11.080]
She the other

[00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:13.320]
Where is Pearl when we need her?

[00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:16.820]
The other day when you were talking on the radio

[00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:23.460]
About the moon of the Canada Cup. Yes, and the caller who didn't know anything and he said it was off sides

[00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:25.280]
And you vehemently

[00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:29.920]
It was offside it was offside, but let me let me also say this today

[00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:32.820]
It wasn't three or four steps offside

[00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:38.520]
No, it was a half a stride it was it was a I'd say about six inches very close because if you look

[00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:41.480]
You have to look at the puck and most of these people don't really understand the rules

[00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:43.720]
They're just looking at the bodies and brindamore

[00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:46.800]
Did appear to be well ahead, but the puck was on the line

[00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:51.660]
Iserman had to puck on the blue line and brindamore tried desperately to get escape back on the line

[00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:55.720]
But was about five six seven inches over the line it was offside, but they blew it they must have

[00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:59.900]
ESPN did a pretty good job on the showcasing and they showed it last time

[00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:01.480]
On cbc2 they showed it

[00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:03.600]
Neil, let me ask you a question you were

[00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:08.360]
You know, I remember back when the strike was ending and and I had said to you

[00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:13.460]
United pay pretty much anything to go to the pro hockey games and of course last year was unbelievable

[00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:15.840]
With the finals how expensive

[00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:20.720]
You know you you we hear about these outlandish prices that we have at the fleet center

[00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:22.960]
Yeah, you know, and I know that for me personally

[00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:27.900]
$48 that ticket that buy two seasons tickets is 96 bucks a game

[00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:34.040]
It's 41 hundred bucks plus parking we have even started to buy a soda or anything down there right

[00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:38.500]
Yeah, I mean you think they'll be 75 bucks a ticket for those seats where not here

[00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:40.540]
No, when we get to the new arena

[00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:41.080]
No

[00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:46.180]
No, because they're good. I don't think it's gonna be all that much more because they're gonna have all the revenue from the sky boxes

[00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:50.540]
I'm not saying I'm not going to say that they're ever gonna lower the price because I'll never believe that right

[00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:55.400]
But I don't think they'll have to jack them way up because they'll have all the revenue from the sky boxes and the advertising and all the other stuff

[00:27:55.400 --> 00:28:02.080]
In addition to which they might have a Mickey Erison to kick around because it looks like he's gonna be coming on his hands and ease and suck and win to be a tenet up in there

[00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:04.800]
Do you think though that there's really enough

[00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:13.520]
corporate sponsorship to sell those things when they're having enough problems with the dolphins and there and that's stuff about the club seats and the and the

[00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:16.960]
License rights for the extra money to buy club seat

[00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:22.220]
Yeah, but you've got to understand the reason that they raised the price on the boxes and the club seats and all of that stuff

[00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:26.160]
It pro player whatever the hell it is this week was because the

[00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:28.380]
Because of the tax situation

[00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:31.840]
That's why all those prices went way up. You know the other day

[00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:37.920]
Something because I'm in the car all the time. I do listen to the Hummer quite frequently. Yeah, I see here we go again

[00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:44.280]
Yeah, well, you know, I'm not gonna walk. No, I'm not not knocking but I'm just showing you how how interesting it is that one day

[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:49.720]
It seems like everybody in their brother listens to the Humper in the afternoon and the next day when they find out Phil is leaving

[00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:55.640]
He's the greatest thing since Halava. Well, all I know is that he has been two things number one

[00:28:55.640 --> 00:29:00.560]
He's been saying all along about Tony Reader and the puppet and then Mickey Erison

[00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:05.860]
I mean he if anybody blasts those guys it's him and I don't

[00:29:05.860 --> 00:29:11.720]
Well, you treat you do. I'm not I treated you just let him have it five seconds before I don't

[00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:20.380]
Well, I'm a phone, but he really let's I mean he is relentless. He's ruthless to them. Yeah, and the other thing is somebody called him up about a

[00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:24.760]
Montertuego and said to him what was his big problem with

[00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:30.760]
Jeff Rimmer and you and he said he said the big problem that he had with Jeff Rimmer was

[00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:36.320]
That he said he reported to you about that he was leaving to a m going to

[00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:39.920]
First of all Jeff Rimmer never told me that that was a listener that told me that

[00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:43.200]
Jeff Rimmer never said anything about Hank going to Q a m to a F a n

[00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:46.340]
That was a listener that started that rumor and had nothing to do with rumor

[00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:50.320]
But it's just an excuse because Hank is jealous and jealous and obsessed with me

[00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:55.880]
So therefore instead of taking shots at me he does it through rumor as if I really care right? Okay, I'm

[00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:59.120]
I'm back to you. Thank you 1015 at W I O D

Okay, 1018 at W I O D was just getting some great news through the grapevine

[00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:27.860]
So anyway, I just want to express my personal opinion. I think Jennifer Rem is a class act all the way

[00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:29.900]
I love Jennifer. She and I have worked together for years

[00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:34.820]
They I have no problems with Jennifer. She's entitled her opinion and the fact that Rick Riley got psychotic yesterday

[00:30:34.820 --> 00:30:37.000]
Because she expressed an opinion he didn't like

[00:30:37.620 --> 00:30:41.040]
Tough crap is basically the way I look at it. That's number one number two

[00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:46.940]
I'm delighted over the fact that we had an opportunity yesterday for Phil Henry to come on a year and do publicly

[00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:51.380]
What he's been doing off the earth for four months now and that is try to convince me to get out of here

[00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:56.940]
No seriously don't you find that I don't know what to use the word disingenuous

[00:30:56.940 --> 00:30:58.880]
sinister subversive

[00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:01.920]
I don't know what term to use

[00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:09.100]
Because I don't know what motivation there could possibly be there because I don't you see there some people you work within the business like years ago

[00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:13.020]
Like I worked with Bill Calder was a good friend of mine. We go to the track. He and his wife were good friends of mine

[00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:15.720]
A Craig Worthing was a good friend of mine when I worked at KT

[00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:16.400]
but

[00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:20.860]
Very rarely do I become close with people that I work with just as George Hilton

[00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:24.360]
That's the understatement of the century. I'm a hardass. Okay, but

[00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:29.240]
In this particular case, I've never even gone out and had a beer or a hamburger with Phil Henry

[00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:32.620]
He's been here two and a half years and there's just never I mean he's here in the afternoon

[00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:36.880]
I leave here at two and there's just never even been the occasion that we've ever even sat down and

[00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:38.960]
talked out of this building once

[00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:47.520]
So why the tremendous interest in my career and where I'm going and what I'm going to be doing I'm not going anywhere

[00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:53.700]
I'm satisfied with making the income that I'm making which starts with a very significant number

[00:31:55.700 --> 00:31:56.060]
and

[00:31:56.060 --> 00:31:56.180]
And

[00:31:56.720 --> 00:32:00.500]
You know, I'm like I said before I don't plan on doing this the rest of my life

[00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:05.800]
I don't want to be the Bob Barker of talk radio. I don't want to be like long John Neville and croak on the air

[00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:12.020]
I don't understand those people. I mean to each its own there are those guys who say oh, if you know once they quit

[00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:17.400]
They croak, you know, that's the that's why George Burns was on stage until the day that he croaked and that's fine

[00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:20.600]
There are some people like that who have evidently that's all there is in life

[00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:26.200]
Maybe after Gracie died that's all George had left to do was puff on cigars instead and hobble around on stage

[00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:27.860]
Maybe that was it whatever. I don't know

[00:32:29.020 --> 00:32:35.860]
But I somehow could probably scrape by I could somehow manage without the delight of coming in here and begging people to talk to me every day

[00:32:35.860 --> 00:32:39.840]
And I would just you know if I could eat out a life that would be it

[00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:43.580]
I would just go away and vanish and disappear and like Andy Williams

[00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:48.660]
That's one thing I do like about Andy Williams and I'm sorry the guy played the godfather yesterday

[00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:51.960]
Because I apologize profusely because Andy can't sing his way out of a paper sack

[00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:56.140]
But at least Andy Williams there's a guy who made a lot of my air outside another one Mike Douglas

[00:32:57.140 --> 00:33:00.220]
Anybody he was on with what's her name the other day? Who's the uh

[00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:06.060]
Who's that new talk show bitch what the hell is her name? She's really she's good what color white

[00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:12.580]
Not Rosio Donald or maybe it was Rosio Donald. Oh, like I said, I take that back. She's not good

[00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:17.160]
Man, no, it was Rosio Donald Mike Douglas because that's right because they were ripping the osmins again

[00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:18.160]
He took the shots for moments

[00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:24.600]
But why not the guy made millions of dollars. What does he need to be uh,

[00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:27.300]
Potschkin around now trying to be an entertainer

[00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:33.140]
So I'm not interested at this stage of my life at this age and after 20 years of

[00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:38.120]
Frustration in this town of like starting all over again of starting. Oh, I'm gonna be syndicated

[00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:39.920]
Great, that's wonderful sure

[00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:46.940]
I'd like to be on nationwide and talking to people and have eight million phone lines and have a thousand phone calls at all times and be making two three million a year

[00:33:46.940 --> 00:33:47.440]
great

[00:33:48.940 --> 00:33:54.860]
Maybe I'm lazy maybe I'm not highly motivated. Maybe I'm just a content even though I come in here and grumble on the year

[00:33:54.860 --> 00:34:02.420]
That's part of the stick. Okay, maybe I'm content with uh, you know, schlepping along with that check that I carry in a suitcase to the bank every Thursday

[00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:04.000]
Maybe it's uh enough for me

[00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:12.180]
But I just I find it just bizarre that this man on an almost daily basis

[00:34:12.180 --> 00:34:18.540]
Uh, you've got to call this agent and I got to get out of here and I'm gonna do this in windows in my contract and windows in the building

[00:34:18.540 --> 00:34:22.080]
I know I don't understand it. I don't know where this man is coming from

[00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:26.060]
Is he really my keeper? Is he looking out for my best interests?

[00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:27.960]
Do I believe that?

[00:34:29.860 --> 00:34:32.680]
Do you believe that do you think that that's what this is all about?

[00:34:32.680 --> 00:34:35.300]
Do you think or do you think that because somebody is leaving

[00:34:35.720 --> 00:34:41.320]
They would enjoy seeing what they left behind to disintegrate and as much respect as I have for Phil Henry

[00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:47.200]
Is that one of the great talents in this industry not just now but ever and I've said that for for since he came in this building

[00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:52.240]
Since he started doing afternoons and we really got the hang of what he's doing. He's a phenomenal tally's a funny guy

[00:34:53.780 --> 00:34:57.800]
But guess what before Phil came here we were doing great

[00:34:59.140 --> 00:35:04.500]
Do you know what I'm saying in other words somehow we survived here before he came this isn't a shot

[00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:07.660]
This is just a statement of fact since we're laying this all out on the table

[00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:13.200]
And I have a feeling that somehow maybe after he leaves even though there's going to be a gigantic void there

[00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:15.800]
We probably will have a chance to succeed again

[00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:22.160]
Especially with the more aggressive ownership that's going to do some marketing and hopefully do some things we might just make it

[00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:29.260]
But I just find it very very peculiar and very unusual that on an almost daily basis

[00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:34.600]
You got to get out of here and it's uh a gratton. I'm not going anywhere. Maybe just out of spite. I'm going to stay now

[00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:38.260]
Because I don't understand that whole deal. I don't get it

[00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:46.500]
It's like when I was walking across the street with Bob Neil the day that the announcement was made of the sale of the radio station

[00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:48.960]
And he said to me he said to me that

[00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:53.720]
Paxton bought WIOD primarily for Neil Rogers in the dolphins those were his words

[00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:56.040]
And he said well, you know if it doesn't work out

[00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:59.980]
There's always a Howard's network and there's always this and there's always and I thought boy

[00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:03.860]
We aren't even across the street yet and already they're like planting the seeds of wow

[00:36:03.860 --> 00:36:06.000]
You know you can always bail out

[00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:13.880]
Think about it or not

[00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:18.240]
1024 wiod dolphins play

[00:36:19.020 --> 00:36:24.120]
And then we like to talk about it every Monday night from six to eight p.m

[00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:32.040]
And sometimes I choose these joy sports talk six ten dolphin edition as deep hole in the mad dog broadcast live from David busters and Hollywood

[00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:38.520]
You can be a part of the action when great prizes like the Miller light NFL player of the year till gate cooler kid a

[00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:44.260]
Free suit from Austin work a digital satellite system and you can catch special appearances by dolphin players

[00:36:44.260 --> 00:36:49.520]
As since these guys planned the NFL you gotta get a whole new that's from our back and shanning limo service

[00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:55.980]
It all happens at one of the most amazing places in south florida david busters right off by 95 in sterling road

[00:36:55.980 --> 00:37:01.280]
There's 50,000 square feet of food and fun including D&B's million dollar midway

[00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:08.120]
Sports talk six ten dolphin edition live from david busters for Miller light gmc truck dealers

[00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:14.220]
Austin birth were really great fit cost less and news talk and energy mid radio six ten

[00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:16.280]
W.I.O.D

[00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:19.600]
News talk and entertainment radio

[00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:27.740]
six ten w i.O.D. You're being very difficult with me this morning. Yes, I am okay 1028 at wiod

[00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:31.320]
So what are you saying George you saying that out of a read with him? Oh, Adam agree

[00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:35.140]
But it's because Adam has become a little suck whole little underling and that's just the way it goes

[00:37:35.140 --> 00:37:36.640]
You know, I can't worry about that

[00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:42.040]
I think that once this thing gets over the guy that called this morning on rickshaw even though he was full of crap in one part

[00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:46.100]
Oh, he said oh, well, yeah that thing would Jennifer that was bad radio. It was great radio

[00:37:46.460 --> 00:37:50.320]
It was some of the best radio we've ever had on this radio station. Yes today. I'm gonna say it again

[00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:54.400]
Everyone in this building the it's like a clock that just stops

[00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:58.280]
We know when the little hand hits the big head and everything freezes in motion

[00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:03.680]
And that's how this building was there was no work going on even in the few departments where they're occasionally a sum

[00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:06.900]
There was nothing going on in this building everybody was gathered round

[00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:10.960]
They had the monitors on in every orifice in every toilet in every

[00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:13.560]
Nook and cranny it was all over the building

[00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:20.860]
And why was that because there was stuff going on it wasn't it wasn't contrived see mr

[00:38:20.860 --> 00:38:28.680]
Ego and a people on the light bulb for years they've been doing that real boring contrived controversy where they try to whip up all this a contrived hate see this was real hate

[00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:31.760]
This was written oh seriously. This was real

[00:38:32.300 --> 00:38:38.520]
Disagreement real honest stuff being laid out and that's one thing that I've always thrived on is like putting stuff on the air that nobody

[00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:42.700]
Else ever puts on the air the audience doesn't want to hear a bunch of contrived crap

[00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:46.280]
With the same mr. Kane and mr. Ciderman

[00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:49.380]
Nobody wants to hear that crap man. Oh man after the first

[00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:53.660]
400 pounds of that crap it starts smelling pretty bad and the taste ain't too good either

[00:38:55.020 --> 00:39:00.400]
But when you have people on who legitimately have some differences there and when you have people who are scapegoating and looking to

[00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:04.100]
Lash out and leash out in every direction to blame others for their failures

[00:39:04.100 --> 00:39:09.420]
It creates the opportunity for a real uh, whatever it was whatever you want for a real soap opera

[00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:15.680]
And I think if if there's one thing that can keep us going these next 10 days and you do realize now

[00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:19.680]
The number up there on the board. I told Adam were changing that number to instead of counting days

[00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:25.460]
We're counting shows because it's a smaller number and it it's it creates like a foreseeable end to this

[00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:29.160]
So we have 10 more shows after today

[00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:35.260]
During which we will be owned by Cox enterprises after which the transition will finally

[00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:41.520]
Finally at a long last take place. We're digging up Martin Luther King will come in on that day and say

[00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:45.800]
Free at last, etc and so on and the old people say oh free will take some

[00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:47.920]
That's right

[00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:54.820]
So here we are just laying it right out there on the line. I'm gonna say it again. I think that uh, you know what we once the

[00:39:54.820 --> 00:39:56.260]
Transition takes place

[00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:59.680]
Ron and Ron as much as I you know what I think are Ron and Ron

[00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:03.520]
I hope they bring all their people over here. I hope they do a 10 share in the morning

[00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:07.380]
Just so there's a possibility that we can have some dribble over in the other day parts

[00:40:07.380 --> 00:40:10.500]
And we might expand our humans instead of talking to the same people

[00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:15.000]
This is one of the biggest problems of this radio station that the uh current owners don't understand

[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:18.100]
And don't want to understand because it requires an effort to change

[00:40:18.100 --> 00:40:23.300]
You can't keep saying the same things to the same people over and over and over again

[00:40:23.860 --> 00:40:27.560]
You have to develop new cum. It's less like these promos that we keep running

[00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:32.520]
There isn't anybody who listens to this radio station that doesn't know we have sports talk that doesn't know

[00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:34.680]
We do the traffic that doesn't know we have new

[00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:38.640]
Exactly there isn't anybody who doesn't know these things already

[00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:45.500]
So what we keep doing is recycling the same cumin telling the same people the same things until they can recite it by rote

[00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:47.060]
You remember Kyle rote, Jr

[00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:50.060]
So maritoki said

[00:40:51.060 --> 00:40:52.200]
Here's my me b. Chilli

[00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:57.260]
You suck ass, oh okay. Thanks so much. Good. We waited for like what half an hour for that

[00:40:57.260 --> 00:40:59.300]
I'm glad you got a rich full life pal

[00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:01.860]

We have an open line on the purple line pound i.o. D1 and brown word

[00:41:07.940 --> 00:41:09.800]
Here's a lady in my me b. Chilli

[00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:12.000]
Hello, new yes

[00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:13.040]

[00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:20.380]
Hello, new yes, I want to wish you from the depth. I don't celebrate happy new year. I don't celebrate it

[00:41:20.380 --> 00:41:24.460]
You don't happy new year to you. Okay happy rochishana. Thank you. Goodbye

[00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:29.620]
Open line and date. I'm not going to come on here pretend for the benefit of our Jewish friends out there that um

[00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:31.280]
Who cares about this stuff?

[00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:35.640]
Stop wasting your money. Okay, go out and throw the moths as a way or whatever it is. We're doing now

[00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:37.460]
That's it paysock throw that stuff away

[00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:42.900]
With this with these Jewish holiday. So it's not really 1996. It's 57

[00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:44.560]
What what is it? What's the year?

[00:41:45.300 --> 00:41:48.580]
Anybody have the thing here? What who knows what it is and who cares

[00:41:49.180 --> 00:41:54.240]
You keep running around telling everybody. Oh, it's not 1996. It's 50 uh, it's 25 25

[00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:57.680]
Here's how it's what Zager and Evan said forget about it already will you

[00:41:58.240 --> 00:42:01.880]
With this religious with this kaka stuff with all this phony baloney stuff

[00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:07.040]
And that you're pure crap, but we'll gotta fast because it's the day of atonement

[00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:11.840]
We got to waitone for our sins. How about an animal sacrifice, huh? Let's go find that sickin

[00:42:12.580 --> 00:42:15.460]
Let's cut out the puffy can see if God is pleased at that

[00:42:15.460 --> 00:42:17.260]
I'm partial to goats personally in fact

[00:42:17.260 --> 00:42:20.020]
I would think that after all these years of sacrificing those animals

[00:42:20.020 --> 00:42:24.880]
I would think that a lot of these gods are getting the hardening of the arteries or hardening of something by now

[00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:31.380]
So cut the crap already. Okay, Zagazoon have a wonderful life and the happy as Shivu and whatever

[00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:33.200]
And happy rosalopas day

[00:42:33.820 --> 00:42:41.720]
I think that it's really fantastic that the rosalopas thing and Friday the 13th and rushes shown are all falling basically at the same time this year

[00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:43.020]
I think I see a lot of similarity

[00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:47.200]
Here's a call from Tampa and we have no idea why because they can't hear us

[00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:51.440]
Hello, yeah, like I said here's a candle hello

[00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:58.100]
Good morning, Neil. Yes, sir. How you doing? Okay. I love the references Zager and Evan's I haven't heard that name and and quite a long time

[00:42:58.100 --> 00:42:59.780]
Yeah, listen about Andy Williams

[00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:04.740]
Oh, please I'm so sorry. I mentioned that night. I know, but the thing is the guys got us up

[00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:10.040]
They're all out in Branson, Missouri. They don't fade away now. They go out there and they get their own convention

[00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:14.420]
All and they make a fortune from nine to five in Branson, Missouri

[00:43:14.420 --> 00:43:17.320]
What's Andy Williams got to do with that is he he's entertaining out there

[00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:23.240]
Yeah, he's got his own place. I couldn't believe it. It was on TV the other night. Yeah, and he looks like a hundred and ten

[00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:24.280]
Uh-huh, you know

[00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:29.280]
Well, thank God we don't have to see him anymore on TV. That's my point. Yeah, he's got his own thing out there

[00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:33.140]
My goodness was on there yesterday. They had to bring on his body parts in a jar

[00:43:33.140 --> 00:43:37.220]
All the people all the people that are at the you don't even hear about anymore

[00:43:37.220 --> 00:43:40.940]
They've all got their own little saloons out there making a fortune

[00:43:40.940 --> 00:43:45.880]
Well, let me ask you this question if you were Bob Barker and had probably 50 or a hundred million dollars floating around somewhere

[00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:50.360]
Would you be on here every day doing that stupid show or coming in the bug once or twice a week to take

[00:43:50.900 --> 00:43:52.080]
He looks ridiculous

[00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:57.600]
What's the point when when do people like Dick Clark and Ed McMahon? I mean, it's got enough for beer money

[00:43:57.600 --> 00:44:01.440]
One of these people ever have enough already. I don't know. It's really sad

[00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:04.900]
They want to keep working until the day they stick their ass in the ground. I don't get it

[00:44:04.900 --> 00:44:07.120]
I know they they said the thing about George Burns

[00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:11.240]
But like but like you were saying that was his whole life. Yeah, business

[00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:15.260]
He knew that great after great. I mean he and Gracie were like, uh, you know

[00:44:15.260 --> 00:44:17.920]
So close and once he died that was all he had left

[00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:22.720]
Yeah, I just read his autobiography one of the great love stories in history was George Burns and Gracie Alan

[00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:27.440]
Yeah, and that's all he had if he didn't if he didn't have a stage he had nothing else

[00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:31.300]
Yeah, the big cigar and the behavior the big one. Yeah, the big one not as big as Milton Burle

[00:44:31.300 --> 00:44:34.760]
But he had a big one, you know, I'll tell you I've been listening to the station and

[00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:39.540]
It's like listening to other people's grief from misery, but I'm telling you you guys

[00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:45.860]
With all this stuff going on has been some of the best radio. I've heard I can't I can't get enough today

[00:44:45.860 --> 00:44:52.180]
I'm gonna say I've been in the 20 years on here in this market yesterday was the greatest day of broadcasting in the history of Miami radio

[00:44:52.180 --> 00:44:53.740]
I heard a bit of it

[00:44:53.740 --> 00:45:00.080]
I called I called Phil and it made a made a reference to Ellis Rubin and he I didn't even I wasn't even sure

[00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:06.360]
Him being in town only two and a half years that he would he would know yeah Ellis Rubin and

[00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:11.720]
He got it right off the bat and and perceived to hang up on me quickly instead of what's funny

[00:45:14.260 --> 00:45:20.820]
I wasn't even sure he was gonna get that yeah, but the guy you don't get you don't get a curveball by him

[00:45:20.820 --> 00:45:26.700]
Yeah, that's for damn sure but one one thing a little slider one thing and so why do you think that Phil Henry is so anxious for me to leave

[00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:30.040]
W.I. O.D. Get out of this market. Why do you think that is I have no idea?

[00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:34.400]
I don't you think it's someone I don't you find it unusual? It's very unusual

[00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:44.660]
I think that nobody wants to get caught from the team no matter what it is and I still think he I don't care if he's going to KFI or YFI or

[00:45:44.660 --> 00:45:51.880]
The Jetsons Network. Yeah, he's going nobody likes to be cut from the team and I agree with you 100%

[00:45:51.880 --> 00:46:00.840]
The only people powerful enough to do what has been done to him is the Miami Dolphins organization and the deal with Brian Cox

[00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:03.100]
Yeah, who else could be behind it?

[00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:07.820]
Well, I think that had a lot to do with it. I mean, I don't you know, I can't say it for sure, but I think that

[00:46:07.820 --> 00:46:10.660]
I know you talk about

[00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:18.960]
I know you took them on you took on Brian Cox and maybe they've for whatever reason the dolphin organization is put up with me for all these years

[00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:26.160]
They they just the humor me and they just don't take me seriously and I've never pissed anybody in the organization off enough to the point where

[00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:29.580]
They've said oh, well if Roger's is on air goodbye, you know, that kind of thing

[00:46:29.580 --> 00:46:34.780]
I guess they figured that mr. Andrew there weren't go. I didn't get away with it

[00:46:34.780 --> 00:46:38.140]
They just had two thin of a forskin. I think that was the problem. Yeah, have a great day pal

[00:46:38.140 --> 00:46:45.980]
See ya two open lines in date 7519 463 751 W. I. Would. We have one in Broward 524 and two

This is the Neil Roger show

[00:46:57.460 --> 00:46:58.660]
This is your brain

[00:47:00.620 --> 00:47:01.720]
Any questions

[00:47:08.140 --> 00:47:13.940]
This I'm used to say to Robbie when dark and other calling it pro player part cause

[00:47:13.940 --> 00:47:15.100]
To the loo

[00:47:15.100 --> 00:47:17.440]
For a change

[00:47:18.120 --> 00:47:22.020]
The new rules are you have to show up in your underwear

[00:47:22.860 --> 00:47:26.820]
And no one ugly is allowed in there so you'll have lots of fun

[00:47:26.820 --> 00:47:29.080]
Checking out those fun

[00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:29.780]
Unbelievable

[00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:34.140]
So I can get my pigs

[00:47:34.140 --> 00:47:37.240]
Up with the game is over

[00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:39.700]
tight just like my food and the loo

[00:47:39.700 --> 00:47:42.980]
Back around over my bulking mouth

[00:47:42.980 --> 00:47:45.660]
Now you can see a lot more at the game

[00:47:46.220 --> 00:47:52.360]
Since everybody is undressed the same and you can look around to see what hanging down

[00:47:53.020 --> 00:47:54.720]
This is paradise vow

[00:47:54.720 --> 00:48:01.720]
I never realized how good it would feel being glad if my jockey's at the football field since derabi is gone

[00:48:02.360 --> 00:48:04.200]
And now it's bb part

[00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:04.760]

[00:48:08.300 --> 00:48:08.360]
Yeah

[00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:14.240]
This is the kind of blonde man for start on this film

[00:48:14.240 --> 00:48:16.160]
I'm gonna wrap it all along

[00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:17.360]
You check it out

[00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:18.560]

I'm gonna lay down

[00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:20.520]
I'm gonna lay down

[00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:21.880]
Well, I'll ride

[00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:22.940]
Horseback

[00:48:23.900 --> 00:48:26.420]
I hated it the full-of-a-posted

[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:29.460]
And met the new team mascot underwear man

[00:48:29.460 --> 00:48:32.640]
Looked for chicks and stared at the fun zone above

[00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:35.820]
At their tunnels of love

[00:48:35.820 --> 00:48:42.500]
I've never realized just how good it would feel being glad if my jockey's at the football field since derabi is gone

[00:48:42.500 --> 00:48:43.180]
Oh

[00:48:43.180 --> 00:48:44.840]
And now it's bb part

[00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:47.800]
Hey Colin cb part

[00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:50.780]
Let's hug it bb part

[00:48:51.580 --> 00:48:52.140]
Yeah

[00:48:52.820 --> 00:48:54.300]
Everybody gotta bring their own pp

[00:48:54.300 --> 00:48:56.140]
Don't forget Sunday one o'clock against the jets

[00:48:56.140 --> 00:48:56.820]
I'll be there

[00:48:56.820 --> 00:48:59.060]
Poor first foot first off in game in two years

[00:48:59.060 --> 00:49:01.100]
This is gonna be some happening. I'll tell you that

[00:49:01.100 --> 00:49:05.800]
I sure hope rich. I hasn't been eaten too much at the trackly at least so I have at least a half a seat to sit in

[00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:08.020]
1043 at w.i.o.d

[00:49:08.020 --> 00:49:11.340]
Here's the lady in Pembroke pines hopefully under the age of a hundred hello

[00:49:11.340 --> 00:49:12.920]
Hi, Neil. Yes, ma'am

[00:49:12.920 --> 00:49:15.200]
I wanted to talk to you about the acon sight for a minute

[00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:16.380]
if I could

[00:49:17.340 --> 00:49:19.200]
But I didn't want to bore you with that

[00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:19.660]
Yeah

[00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:21.980]
But I'm not having very much success

[00:49:21.980 --> 00:49:22.560]
Yeah

[00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:23.980]
And I don't know who to talk to

[00:49:23.980 --> 00:49:25.660]
I mean is there anyone that I can

[00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:29.420]
Do you have the book? Yeah, I have the book. I even have the cookbook

[00:49:29.420 --> 00:49:31.420]
Yeah, and how long have you been on it? A month

[00:49:31.420 --> 00:49:34.820]
Yeah, and how much have you lost? I lost 10 pounds in the first week

[00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:37.620]
I gained five pounds back in the third week

[00:49:38.520 --> 00:49:40.020]
And you were still on it? Yeah

[00:49:41.360 --> 00:49:41.740]
Faithfully

[00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:43.920]
You're drinking diet soda? Yep

[00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:46.920]
More water so than than anything else

[00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:50.120]
But I went to the woman over at Delight Perempepper pines

[00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:52.660]
And she said she's an authorite seller of all his products

[00:49:53.140 --> 00:49:57.460]
And I asked her what the problem was and she asked me if I was taking supplements and I told her no

[00:49:58.020 --> 00:49:59.640]
She told me that was the problem

[00:50:00.540 --> 00:50:05.100]
I uh, I don't agree nobody lost me. Nobody loses weight by taking supplements

[00:50:05.100 --> 00:50:10.300]
The only reason you take supplements are so that you don't lose essential nutrients while you're cutting down on

[00:50:10.980 --> 00:50:16.100]
Carbohydrates right and I don't supplements don't make you if just taking supplements made you lose weight

[00:50:16.100 --> 00:50:18.480]
Then everybody would just be popping pills and losing weight

[00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:20.900]
Exactly, and that's why I didn't believe in it

[00:50:20.900 --> 00:50:23.240]
But I mean who else can I turn to to help me?

[00:50:23.320 --> 00:50:25.740]
I know why don't you call it did you call the number in the book?

[00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:27.860]
Oh, I you know what I didn't even know there was one in there

[00:50:27.860 --> 00:50:30.800]
I don't remember what it is, but it's in there

[00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:33.180]
I definitely will look for it because I just

[00:50:33.180 --> 00:50:38.720]
And see what you need to do I don't I don't go along with anybody that just goes out and buys the book and does it on

[00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:44.160]
Your own you've got to find a doctor that believes in it and that'll supervise it and it'll take the periodic blood test

[00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:47.620]
And see how your cholesterol is doing in your triglycerides in the whole deal

[00:50:48.020 --> 00:50:49.580]
And uh and answer your questions

[00:50:49.580 --> 00:50:54.940]
You know, I'm never ever again, but gonna be putting a position of a playing doctor here on you

[00:50:54.940 --> 00:50:58.860]
I just don't know I don't know the answers. I understand that I didn't I

[00:50:58.860 --> 00:51:02.460]
And even if I were a doctor I couldn't I could I diagnosed you over the phone?

[00:51:02.460 --> 00:51:05.620]
Do I know am I following you around watching what you're eating all day every day?

[00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:06.420]
I don't know

[00:51:06.420 --> 00:51:11.760]
I just didn't know if there was anyone that I could just slow if you would have just slowed down

[00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:15.300]
I would understood it, but to gain five pounds back if you know, you know

[00:51:15.300 --> 00:51:19.100]
And maybe maybe you're eating stuff that isn't legitimate that isn't really on the diet

[00:51:19.100 --> 00:51:23.860]
Are you buying some of the uh because you mentioned a place are you buying cheesecakes and the other stuff?

[00:51:24.060 --> 00:51:29.020]
Well, I didn't buy there actually I did buy them, but I didn't like them so I made my own yeah

[00:51:29.020 --> 00:51:33.340]
But I you know, I checked all the carbohydrates and I watched you know what I was using in them

[00:51:33.820 --> 00:51:36.660]
And I have to say that I have stayed under 20

[00:51:37.840 --> 00:51:42.800]
Trying under 20 grams. Yeah trying to um, you know get things moving

[00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:47.140]
But I had I took me one day to get into ketosis. Well, maybe you got a yeast problem

[00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:54.380]
Yeah, but again, I can't really expect it could be a lot of things, but you got to you got to talk to a doctor

[00:51:54.380 --> 00:51:59.120]
You have to find a doctor that don't go huh? I are there actual doctors that follow this diet

[00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:04.700]
I mean I hear about all this fend fend and redux and all these pills and everything and I'm not interested in that

[00:52:04.700 --> 00:52:09.800]
But I didn't know if there were actual doctors that all those all those pills are our speed. That's all that stuff is

[00:52:10.200 --> 00:52:15.340]
I'm not interested in any of that. I just want to stick to the diet. Yeah, I know there were doctors that actually followed it

[00:52:16.120 --> 00:52:18.900]
Yeah, and that's why I called you because I really didn't know where to turn

[00:52:18.900 --> 00:52:21.320]
Yeah, I don't expect you to tell me what to do over the phone

[00:52:21.320 --> 00:52:25.720]
Well, I can have George give you the my doctor's number all the way see you're in brown. He's in Miami Beach

[00:52:25.720 --> 00:52:29.560]
But you know, it's up to you. Maybe you can call there him. He's he's on it himself

[00:52:29.560 --> 00:52:34.160]
He's a real big believer in it. I mean, I have never talked to anybody that hasn't lost weight on the diet

[00:52:34.160 --> 00:52:39.000]
Yeah, and that's why and I have a hundred pounds to lose right now like I'm trying to lose 20 now

[00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:41.940]
Well, then though if you got that much to lose you've definitely got to have a doctor

[00:52:41.940 --> 00:52:45.360]
You can't just buy a book and start patching around with your body

[00:52:46.520 --> 00:52:51.280]
Hang on a second. Okay. Thank okay line four you got the stuff right two open lines in day

[00:52:51.280 --> 00:52:56.700]
It's seven five one the doctors in docked in the I mean I sympathized with her plate, but I can't I'm not the guy

[00:52:57.120 --> 00:52:58.620]
Believe me. I'm fat as a pig

[00:52:58.620 --> 00:53:01.780]
seven five one nine four six three seven five one

[00:53:01.780 --> 00:53:02.620]
W-I-O-D

[00:53:02.620 --> 00:53:08.260]
We're gonna come to the answer this morning about why Phil Henry is so anxious for the rest of us to all bail out of W-I-O-D

[00:53:08.260 --> 00:53:13.060]
We're also going to find out we're gonna hear from Jews who are not celebrating a new year or a young kipper

[00:53:13.060 --> 00:53:15.360]
We're not going to shul we're gonna hear from them

[00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:21.260]
We're gonna also find out if Dave Hyde is doing speed or other drugs because lately between his column about the Troy

[00:53:21.260 --> 00:53:22.780]
Ackman book by skip bailess

[00:53:22.780 --> 00:53:27.300]
Which all it did was publicize the book see I don't see that anybody has fallen off the deep end

[00:53:27.300 --> 00:53:31.160]
I didn't see Troy Ackman get benched. I saw Dallas kick the crap out of the giants last week

[00:53:31.660 --> 00:53:36.780]
I don't see people swooning diving it off tall build tall buildings because Troy Ackman might be gay or might not

[00:53:37.220 --> 00:53:43.340]
Nobody really gives a crap and yet Dave Hyde helped to sell a lot of books and create a lot of interest in that and bring it to everybody's attention

[00:53:43.340 --> 00:53:48.300]
And now in his column today, which is one of these columns where he just has a lot of idle thoughts about this and that

[00:53:48.300 --> 00:53:52.000]
And I was reading it and as usual enjoying Dave Hyde's column because I like Dave

[00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:58.880]
But he gets to a thing about he says you know who I feel sympathetic towards in his heat situation while not agreeing with his arena stand

[00:53:58.880 --> 00:54:00.020]
Mickey Harrison

[00:54:00.620 --> 00:54:03.600]
His family got involved in the heat to help the area

[00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:06.500]
He took over the heat completely to keep the team in Miami

[00:54:06.500 --> 00:54:10.960]
All he wants to do is build a championship team not a sports empire all he does is get ripped

[00:54:11.600 --> 00:54:15.140]
And I'm wondering is this man is this supposed to be tongue in cheek is this a joke

[00:54:15.140 --> 00:54:18.840]
His family got involved in the heat to help out the area

[00:54:18.840 --> 00:54:21.880]
And that's why they wanted to push through they wanted to sneak through this arena

[00:54:21.880 --> 00:54:27.880]
They wanted to force the panthers out of town and they wanted to sneak through this new arena three and a half blocks away from the present one

[00:54:27.880 --> 00:54:31.440]
Right by the port of iami for the fun and benefit of the irison family and the herald

[00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:31.860]
I

[00:54:33.360 --> 00:54:42.240]
Mean let's let's get serious. Okay, not to mention of course all the high jinks with pat Riley and jawan Howard and all the other stuff that they tried to pull the wool over the NBA's eyes forget about that

[00:54:43.120 --> 00:54:47.720]
And the fact that they went up there and lied in broward counted to the commissioners and Pauline Winnick did the

[00:54:48.120 --> 00:54:56.300]
Micky's bidding up there and pretended that they really had an interest in going in the new broward arena and then brought all the information back to date and try to pull the wool over the people in date county

[00:54:57.580 --> 00:55:00.480]
Dave Hyde man, I think I think too many of those default shows man

[00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:03.620]
I think it'll do it to you better watch out for my friend Ruben

[00:55:04.460 --> 00:55:07.700]
Here's a mobile implantation. Hello. Yeah, how you doing great?

[00:55:08.080 --> 00:55:08.220]

One quick bang a big report for you. Yes sir corner of

[00:55:12.900 --> 00:55:14.560]
Now till and

[00:55:14.560 --> 00:55:20.480]
Howard yeah, I never see one of these before the pig sitting on the corner with a no pad and pen

[00:55:21.040 --> 00:55:24.040]
And the only thing I can figure out he's taking a seat belt survey

[00:55:24.980 --> 00:55:28.480]
Standing there smoking a cigarette and he just he just standing on the corner

[00:55:28.480 --> 00:55:32.360]
Down on the corner with a pad and pen no radar gun no nothing

[00:55:32.360 --> 00:55:36.660]
Yeah, maybe he's checking out who's being audio nice. Maybe he's making a list and checking it twice

[00:55:36.660 --> 00:55:41.480]
He's got a check here and a check there and but people flying by and his head's going left and right

[00:55:41.480 --> 00:55:44.380]
But he doesn't have a pistola. He's not the shoot no radar

[00:55:44.380 --> 00:55:49.260]
No pistol and no radar gun no nothing. Huh, I never seen a seat belt check before but

[00:55:49.840 --> 00:55:52.360]
Look like he's running his own little survey there great

[00:57:54.600 --> 00:57:57.080]
Yeah, yes sir good morning to you win as deus

[00:57:57.080 --> 00:58:04.480]
Uh this this Rick inside or this Rick and Jennifer M thing. I like to address that if I could the Rick and Rem thing

[00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:05.180]
Yeah, right

[00:58:05.640 --> 00:58:11.640]
We're good. They're great. They're me, you know, they're going back to afternoons, which is even more great

[00:58:12.160 --> 00:58:15.760]
But uh why why not? I'm gonna have to why but I think Rick

[00:58:16.320 --> 00:58:18.600]
Picking on Jennifer Rem is really low

[00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:21.760]
And we're him picking on everyone on the news and the traffic

[00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:26.760]
Traffic stuff. Let me just let me explain of course the traffic sucks, but let me explain this to you

[00:58:26.760 --> 00:58:32.040]
Okay, Jennifer is the news director, right and what Jennifer took exception to was the fact that Rick

[00:58:32.040 --> 00:58:39.120]
You know when I kind of like brought this all out of the closet yesterday that Rick was placing blame on Jackie a Quinn and

[00:58:39.120 --> 00:58:42.840]
certain other people in the news department for the demise of the numbers on a morning show

[00:58:42.840 --> 00:58:49.620]
And she took that personally and I would you know tend to agree with her like I told Rick the other day that bringing back Chuck Meyer is not the answer

[00:58:50.160 --> 00:58:55.720]
And uh, I don't think that most people tune into any show because they want to hear a certain news person

[00:58:55.720 --> 00:58:59.160]
Especially on this radio station not gonna understand if we were in all news station

[00:58:59.160 --> 00:59:03.960]
I'm gonna understand if we were like an old funny dutty station where people wanted to hear a Walter Cronkite doing the news

[00:59:03.960 --> 00:59:06.160]
But that's not the nature of this radio station

[00:59:06.160 --> 00:59:08.520]
You're only here in for five minutes on each side of the hour

[00:59:08.520 --> 00:59:16.500]
And it was long as somebody can seem to read more than two words without stumbling and falling down and just pass along the information and play the spot and get out

[00:59:16.500 --> 00:59:19.220]
That should be it that's exactly right

[00:59:19.220 --> 00:59:22.480]
And of course one of the things that never did come up in a course of conversation yesterday

[00:59:22.480 --> 00:59:27.080]
It was the fact that Rick has never gotten into a newscast on time in the 70 years or whatever

[00:59:27.080 --> 00:59:31.540]
It said that he's been on this radio station which of course puts additional stress on the news people

[00:59:31.540 --> 00:59:37.380]
So uh, that's what generated all of that and I think that when you want to make it into a personal thing that's that's up to the two of them but

[00:59:38.040 --> 00:59:43.640]
Well for him to bring it out like that and it's just so ass-lined for him to blame everyone in the news

[00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:48.580]
That you're only here in a total of five minutes on each side of the hour about the news. Yeah

[00:59:49.460 --> 00:59:52.900]
It's you know, it's a little fault and his program isn't bad anyway

[00:59:53.460 --> 00:59:56.840]
But to him to get so petty to try to blatantly blame well see

[00:59:56.840 --> 01:00:02.120]
I think that when you've got deficiencies and we've all got things that we can fix nobody does a perfect show

[01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:05.520]
I don't know anybody including yours truly who does a perfect show we can all improve

[01:00:06.100 --> 01:00:10.160]
Perfect as I get it but but yeah right but but when you're doing your gardening

[01:00:10.660 --> 01:00:16.020]
But the the thing is this that when you've got areas that need to be worked on like for example like I you know

[01:00:16.020 --> 01:00:20.420]
I tried suggesting different things to Rick over the years and he he'll solicit your opinion

[01:00:20.420 --> 01:00:23.400]
But then he what whatever you say he wants to do the opposite like

[01:00:23.400 --> 01:00:28.340]
Anyone you're not the other Gilbert and I'm telling you that this guy this guy that they have calling in

[01:00:28.340 --> 01:00:32.020]
I don't know what the guy's name is he's from somewhere in the Midwest and they pay him to make these calls

[01:00:32.020 --> 01:00:36.400]
You know time break out and Bob dole. Yeah, he's he's like a comedy guy allegedly

[01:00:36.980 --> 01:00:40.360]
This guy is the kiss of death. I'm telling you out in the last year

[01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:44.620]
I've never heard that guy come on without punching the button and turning that show off immediately

[01:00:44.620 --> 01:00:49.560]
And I think I got a some kind of idea of what humor is okay the guy's not funny

[01:00:49.560 --> 01:00:55.200]
He's pathetic no and Gilbert is is less than that and I bring those things up this morning and right away

[01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:56.900]
It's like I just brought in a knife again

[01:00:56.900 --> 01:00:58.440]
I'd like stab Rick in the back or something

[01:00:58.440 --> 01:01:01.480]
He just takes great offense with that and I don't know what that's all about

[01:01:01.480 --> 01:01:03.280]
Well, I think he just needs to grow up a little bit

[01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:06.360]
Well, that's part of it. I think instead of being stubborn in a hard ass

[01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:08.260]
Which I thought he was moving away from that a little bit

[01:01:08.260 --> 01:01:13.340]
You got to start patching up those areas that need some work instead of lashing out and looking for a scapegoat

[01:01:13.340 --> 01:01:19.200]
And blaming the newest person or the guy that the janitor that empties out the waste basket as for the reason why you're not doing his

[01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:27.640]
Great as you might definitely and I love Jennifer M everybody loves Jennifer. I bought her a lip to nice tea bottle

[01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:34.280]
Remember that little thing they were doing the bidding on the stuff in the garbage your cigar. Oh, yeah

[01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:38.680]
Remember yeah, why I have a lip to nice tea bottle that was on Phil show. Yes, it was right

[01:01:38.680 --> 01:01:44.960]
So I take exception and I take a personal work says about my Jennifer M it just keeps getting bigger

[01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:46.500]
Okay, pal have a great day

[01:01:46.500 --> 01:01:52.540]
Okay, we have an open line in date 751 is Jennifer in the building there? She on a she

[01:01:52.540 --> 01:01:55.980]
Resting or something because I noticed Jackie Quinn took off for the weekend

[01:01:55.980 --> 01:01:57.800]
She went up to the northeast somewhere to get out of here

[01:01:57.800 --> 01:02:00.200]
She probably went up there hoping to get hit by that hurricane

[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.560]
Because it was pretty hortant pretty intense here yesterday

[01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:08.980]
So she's gone and if Jennifer see I don't I don't know what the problem is

[01:02:08.980 --> 01:02:12.520]
I mean I like Terry Griffin is sitting in there right now. We love Terry Terry is great

[01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:13.840]
She does a super job on the news

[01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:17.380]
I don't think people specifically tune in the show because they want to your Terry do the news

[01:02:17.380 --> 01:02:21.260]
But she's sensational and it's great and we're gonna miss her because she's not going with us is she

[01:02:22.760 --> 01:02:23.120]
No

[01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:28.520]
Damn it and we wish that you were thank you. You know how I feel and the Jennifer

[01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:32.920]
She's been doing the news on this show for a long time. I'm most of the day parts and

[01:02:33.540 --> 01:02:36.420]
It's great and once in a blue moon. I'll come on at the end

[01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:41.660]
We'll have a little verbal intercourse back and forth and you know if my if the share on this show dropped a point

[01:02:41.660 --> 01:02:44.180]
Or when during those periods of time when the numbers go down a little bit

[01:02:44.180 --> 01:02:50.000]
I don't come on say oh it's the news people's fault. It's that damn Terry Griffin and that Jennifer Reem. It's their fault

[01:02:51.980 --> 01:02:53.820]
And I think it's unfortunate

[01:02:53.820 --> 01:02:58.320]
But I'm glad that it came up because I think that it'll force some people to reassess their attitudes

[01:02:58.320 --> 01:03:00.340]
Although I'm not sure that's really happened yet

[01:03:00.340 --> 01:03:05.120]
But I think that if we continue banging away at it some people will be forced to reassess their own performance

[01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:07.960]
and their own involvement and their own effort and their own

[01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:14.620]
Priorities and kind of like put things in perspective all of course there might be some people who are beyond doing that

[01:03:14.620 --> 01:03:17.140]
But again, I don't want to conjecture time will tell

[01:03:18.300 --> 01:03:20.280]
Here's my my hammy hello

[01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:20.840]
Hello

[01:03:21.540 --> 01:03:23.260]
Neil whatever. Yeah, hey

[01:03:23.260 --> 01:03:25.600]
Rick is a crybaby man

[01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:27.240]
Yeah, he wants that and you

[01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:32.420]
We're gonna get her for him this morning. He's a trainer ripper and you know when it's they she has a guts to go off on you

[01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:37.940]
He's a jack yeah, he's blaming her for all his problems. Yeah, he's a

[01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:43.340]
He should think responsibly stop talking about how many years if I told him to grow up here in Butchup

[01:03:43.340 --> 01:03:47.840]
Okay, and I'm thinking that right now if we really keep banging away on this to just maybe I know there's

[01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:50.040]
There are miracles they don't happen very often

[01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:56.500]
But just maybe there will be a little growth just a little fuzz a little for a little something might start and got only knows what that might turn into

[01:03:57.120 --> 01:04:03.920]
You're going to into the soul of stupidity. I think I can know you I OD my ammy fort-lotter day and you talk and entertain with radio

[01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:06.300]
610 W I OD

[01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:14.000]
Oh

[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:14.740]
Oh

[01:04:14.740 --> 01:04:14.740]

[01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:18.280]
What

[01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:18.960]
Oh

[01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:20.740]
Jennifer

[01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:25.960]
We like what you say

[01:04:27.860 --> 01:04:31.000]
Tell those assholes they can't all go

[01:04:32.180 --> 01:04:32.920]
In it

[01:04:32.920 --> 01:04:38.640]
Just so no one needs the headlines quite like

[01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:43.620]
We love the way

[01:04:43.620 --> 01:04:45.940]
You speak your mind

[01:04:49.860 --> 01:04:59.340]
You're right when you say that this place needs a giant and enormous glow job

[01:05:01.380 --> 01:05:02.200]
Jennifer

[01:05:03.380 --> 01:05:05.240]
Say it's not to be

[01:05:07.380 --> 01:05:07.860]
Jennifer

[01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:11.940]
That you'll really feel

[01:05:11.940 --> 01:05:17.900]
Jennifer says you don't like

[01:05:17.900 --> 01:05:19.340]
Baby

[01:05:19.340 --> 01:05:21.620]
A life

[01:05:21.620 --> 01:05:25.600]
Cost of what reads the headlines quite like

[01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:26.720]
Jennifer

[01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:34.240]
Jennifer

[01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:34.940]
Jennifer

[01:05:34.940 --> 01:05:41.660]
You're being very difficult with me this morning. Okay. 1106 at W I OD happy Friday happy Friday the 13th happy Russia

[01:05:41.660 --> 01:05:48.380]
Shona happy new year happy a weekend happy whatever you want to be happy about the market somebody must be happy the market's going bananas today

[01:05:48.380 --> 01:05:49.980]
It's a 55 point

[01:05:49.980 --> 01:05:53.260]
The next X up 18 points, which is the equivalent of like 90

[01:05:53.260 --> 01:05:57.960]
The Dow points it's going bananas. So let's just close it down right now before they change their mind

[01:05:58.460 --> 01:06:03.760]
We have got a board here that I wouldn't wish on Hermann Gehringman look at that what's going on here today?

[01:06:03.860 --> 01:06:06.280]
Is it because of Russia Shona didn't I predict this the other day?

[01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:11.400]
It's another excuse every day line and two of the Broward lines and the purple line

[01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:15.000]
I got two calls sitting there on the board after now of ranting and raving and carrying on

[01:06:16.060 --> 01:06:19.600]
And gesticulating and opening up and bleeding all over the place here for you

[01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:22.360]
It just so they don't care they got no comment they have no ideas

[01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:26.420]
It's just like the thing I brought up with Rick this morning about that guy that they pay to make those calls

[01:06:26.840 --> 01:06:32.000]
Who's you know there's I've always said there's nothing worse than somebody trying to be funny who wasn't

[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:36.500]
I bring that up to Rick and you people won't call you want you they got nothing to say about it one way or the other

[01:06:38.380 --> 01:06:42.240]
Because generally like I've said before the people who call our ass liquors and they just want to

[01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:45.240]
We'd appreciate themselves and that's that's the purpose of the call

[01:06:46.340 --> 01:06:50.820]
Here's for Lauderdale. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. Neil God. Yes, I am.

[01:06:50.820 --> 01:06:56.740]
A few comments. Let me show you your Dave Hyde, Harrison bang. I

[01:06:56.740 --> 01:07:02.160]
Agreed. Okay, we have two open lines in date seven five one we got one in Broward five two four one on a green line

[01:07:02.160 --> 01:07:08.040]
I tell you I've never heard some real losers in my time but going back to 9.15 this morning starting with pearl and pearl

[01:07:08.040 --> 01:07:13.800]
Mesta and the other geriatrics we've heard from is there anybody alive out there I'm extending the hand

[01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:18.900]
A friendship or the sort of democles or anything in between what is it that we can stick in you attoya

[01:07:20.280 --> 01:07:27.640]
Jesus God almighty talk about the aging demographic how about bringing Henry Barrow into the news on Rick and so two old oh sorry

[01:07:29.600 --> 01:07:32.380]
How about Tom Hopkins? Oh, it doesn't have a colon sorry

[01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:35.560]
Here's a bokeh hello

[01:07:35.560 --> 01:07:38.080]
Happy everything everybody right

[01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:40.760]
Thank you for the party some history

[01:07:40.760 --> 01:07:45.100]
101 this morning on the Rick and such show the what radio lesson

[01:07:45.900 --> 01:07:53.600]
I thought you were literally tutoring rip this morning no, I was just trying to give some input because they are making this big switch over the afternoon

[01:07:53.600 --> 01:08:00.640]
And I think Rick ought to concentrate. I'm trying to get him focused into concentrating on the things that he could do to improve the show as

[01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:06.960]
A post to lashing out and blaming news people and janitors and watchmakers and everybody else

[01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:13.000]
But I did catch one thing every suggestion you made to be sort of resistant right exactly that's the thing with Rick

[01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:19.280]
In fact, I should probably tell him that Gilbert is sensational and the guy that does those phone things is the funniest guy I've ever heard in my life

[01:08:19.280 --> 01:08:20.500]
They'll both disappear in a heartbeat

[01:08:20.500 --> 01:08:25.000]
Right now also I'm Jewish I don't celebrate the rest of son right

[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:25.920]
Oh great

[01:08:26.660 --> 01:08:31.000]
I call my mother she lives in Chicago I wish you're happy new year because she's a good old girl

[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.440]
But I don't care about it and there's a bad in me

[01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:39.000]
Well, I want to hear from all the non-observant Jews today who are much more concerned with eating humontosh and at Purim

[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:42.200]
And with being circumcised and with all these hocus-bocus holiday

[01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:48.840]
And a few other things first of all when the very just crash occurred Jennifer Renkin and I did a terrific show

[01:08:48.840 --> 01:08:53.380]
She's a bit of a great news lady on them to see that she's subject to any criticism

[01:08:53.960 --> 01:09:02.200]
And finally for Phil Henry listen without a meal and without the dolphins there is no WIOD

[01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:07.740]
And you know LA may be the greatest place in the world but buying good luck

[01:09:07.740 --> 01:09:13.740]
Let's stop blasting us and putting down our town the heck with it we've got a live here and we're going to make the best of it

[01:09:13.740 --> 01:09:16.660]
Well, I'm blasting it too I mean I hate it here in many respects

[01:09:16.660 --> 01:09:23.700]
But I'm making a good living and I like the weather but other than that I'm not changing my tune because Phil Henry is leaving

[01:09:23.700 --> 01:09:27.180]
That would be very disingenuous to use the word that I've become one of my favorites lately

[01:09:27.740 --> 01:09:31.760]
But I'm just I'm curious as to why he's got this fetish with yesterday

[01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:37.980]
It was trying to convince both Rick and suds and yours truly that the past years are greener every place else

[01:09:37.980 --> 01:09:47.340]
And we ought to be getting out of here and it just smacks to me of a Cox corporate effort to finish off and break this place into a million pieces before they handed over to Paxton

[01:09:47.340 --> 01:09:51.080]
There was no doubt in my mind that that's where they're coming from that's what they want to do

[01:09:51.080 --> 01:09:53.260]
You said it yesterday it's radio spike

[01:09:53.260 --> 01:09:56.880]
Yeah, well, I've said that for years but I mean now more so than ever

[01:09:56.880 --> 01:10:03.740]
I mean well how how if you've got any kind of honor if you've got any kind of decency if you've got any kind of credibility

[01:10:03.740 --> 01:10:10.660]
How do you make a financial deal with somebody and sell them a property and then try to destroy it before they take control of it

[01:10:10.660 --> 01:10:16.500]
It would be like it would be like you're selling somebody your house and then before the closing date you run around trashing the house

[01:10:16.500 --> 01:10:20.640]
So that when they come in on the closing they they they walk into a piece of crap

[01:10:21.180 --> 01:10:28.740]
Well, I don't think that I want to get sucked into that I think I'm just going to enjoy the programs and everything's going to turn out okay

[01:10:28.740 --> 01:10:29.500]
I agree

[01:10:29.500 --> 01:10:30.500]
All right

[01:10:30.500 --> 01:10:31.120]
Have a good one

[01:10:32.180 --> 01:10:38.500]
Okay, there you go another non-observant you we need a lot more of them calling in who are going to be wasting their time rushing to shul and putting on a phony act

[01:10:38.500 --> 01:10:40.580]
Because it happens to be one of the important holidays

[01:10:40.580 --> 01:10:45.000]
I mean how do you separate well this one's important and simple story that's not that important

[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:46.400]
Come on already

[01:10:46.980 --> 01:10:51.700]
Stop with this archaic stuff. By Ruchat Arnoia. Loheno Melachemi your money

[01:10:53.220 --> 01:11:01.600]
Jesus two open lines on the green lines all this religious stuff these bubble my sees that's the main reason that's the one thing to go along with what Phil was saying yesterday

[01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:05.100]
And I admitted it I would like to have a much broader forum speak to a lot more people

[01:11:05.100 --> 01:11:10.820]
But that's the main reason because there is no one anywhere in this country no one anywhere

[01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:23.860]
Who speaks out against organized religion and who just on a practically daily basis rips into all this hypocrisy and bull crap and the child molesting priests and all the hatred and all this stuff that's going on all over the world

[01:11:23.860 --> 01:11:29.960]
Because of these fairy tales because of these fantasies because of what religion does best and that is generating hatred

[01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:35.240]
And yes, I would like you know you've heard me say that for 20 years and probably getting tired of hearing it

[01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:42.280]
But there's a lot of other people that never heard anybody express that and maybe just a few of them might stop and think hey you know something that makes some sense maybe

[01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:52.240]
But hey it's not good business 12 minutes after 11 at W I O D that I'm aware total famous 7761 for just option

That's true

[01:14:12.220 --> 01:14:14.140]
I knew that how I know that Jim Scholler

[01:14:14.140 --> 01:14:16.100]
Everybody knows that Jim Scholler's cut

[01:14:17.180 --> 01:14:20.320]
In fact every time they make out the new line up you're the first one to get cut

[01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:21.660]

[01:14:21.660 --> 01:14:24.200]

Go out your showgirls and it's glamorous and it's fun it's exciting it's cool

[01:14:54.780 --> 01:14:59.020]
So were you there when they blew out boy Gary or was that after your departure?

[01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:03.520]
He came in and laughed after I did so that was fun

[01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:04.000]
Yeah

[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:05.400]
I missed him completely

[01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:10.200]
He was there a very brief time that was one of the shortest rains since the pigeons the over plantation

[01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:11.800]
Yeah about five minutes too long

[01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:12.600]
Yeah

[01:15:12.600 --> 01:15:13.820]
Yeah in and out

[01:15:13.820 --> 01:15:17.640]
Well you know what he told Randy he said well it's radio I got blown out that's radio

[01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:20.000]
Yeah you know I didn't get invited to that wedding either

[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:25.640]
I don't even think he sued anybody up there it just he got blown out that's radio that's the way life is say I V to A

[01:15:25.640 --> 01:15:30.520]
I think Randy forgot which which mental war you had to be committed to so I didn't get invited out of it

[01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:32.800]
So did you send Randy a wedding gift by the way?

[01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:35.080]
No I didn't hear it you know I didn't hear it all after the fact

[01:15:35.080 --> 01:15:36.020]
Did you attend her wedding?

[01:15:36.420 --> 01:15:36.640]
No

[01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:38.260]
Did you notice that they were getting married?

[01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:38.720]
No

[01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:39.300]
Yeah

[01:15:39.300 --> 01:15:40.540]
Did I care? No

[01:15:40.540 --> 01:15:41.060]
Right

[01:15:41.060 --> 01:15:41.760]
Okay

[01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:45.140]
Yeah so what's the point?

[01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:45.780]
Exactly

[01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:47.980]
I don't know why the hell did you call me?

[01:15:48.140 --> 01:15:49.080]
I heard the wedding was in

[01:15:49.080 --> 01:15:49.360]
Where?

[01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:50.660]
But I could be wrong

[01:15:50.660 --> 01:15:56.200]
Yeah she evidently was on here dissing me yesterday for not sending her a wedding gift and acknowledging there

[01:15:56.200 --> 01:15:58.440]
How the hell was I supposed to know they were getting married?

[01:15:58.520 --> 01:16:01.260]
You know what he doesn't make any difference because nobody's listening to her

[01:16:01.260 --> 01:16:01.680]
Right

[01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:03.480]
So I mean the only one that's what he told me

[01:16:03.480 --> 01:16:09.160]
The only one they're listening to is Lee Fowler and they're treating him like a dog

[01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:09.640]
So

[01:16:10.340 --> 01:16:12.900]
I heard that he was suicidal I mean literally

[01:16:12.900 --> 01:16:18.340]
Well yeah who wouldn't be I mean the guy I mean he goes I mean regardless of what you think about him

[01:16:18.340 --> 01:16:23.180]
And we're not he stole your act the fact of the matter is the guy goes in does his best day after day

[01:16:23.180 --> 01:16:27.400]
They're treating him like a dog he's on he goes in for kidney dialysis three times a week

[01:16:27.400 --> 01:16:29.260]
And still shows up on time to do a show

[01:16:29.260 --> 01:16:29.600]
Yeah

[01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:33.480]
And you know and he's the only one with any numbers and they treat him like dirt

[01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:36.560]
He has numbers he does he's the only one on the station who does

[01:16:36.560 --> 01:16:42.200]
How do you like that he's up there getting numbers stealing my act the Hummers the only one on QAM with any number stealing my act

[01:16:42.200 --> 01:16:43.400]
Well there you go, isn't it?

[01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:46.900]
Well and I'm still sitting here getting a few numbers doing my own act how do you like that?

[01:16:47.300 --> 01:16:48.520]
The act that never died

[01:16:49.320 --> 01:16:49.680]
Yeah

[01:16:50.680 --> 01:16:52.320]
Well listen Skyler this has really been

[01:16:52.920 --> 01:16:57.040]
Almost as good as that guy that calls Rick and Suts in the morning from Indiana so from Elkhardt Indiana

Here's a dear field hello hello yes sir just a non-religious you calling you up to say oh

[01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:24.600]
Oh

And I resisted I resisted Judaism ever since I was I can remember yeah I didn't even want to be barmed

[01:18:31.940 --> 01:18:36.080]
You got to be honest though Judaism is a great culinary religion

[01:18:36.080 --> 01:18:41.020]
Well it's a great gastronomic religion we got Homan Toshan on Purim we got the well you know

[01:18:41.020 --> 01:18:44.280]
I guess over I could live without without the stale bread with the monsters you know

[01:18:44.280 --> 01:18:47.180]
I used to like the holidays they used to like to take off school

[01:18:47.180 --> 01:18:54.080]
Yeah that's right lots of holidays including some two-dayers and eight-dayers and some real good long drawn out holidays

[01:18:54.080 --> 01:18:55.380]
There you go we're no dummies

[01:18:55.380 --> 01:19:02.640]
But I if I didn't go to Tampa and I didn't have a permit I couldn't watch Frank Mahavish or Johnny Power go and play hockey

[01:19:02.640 --> 01:19:03.360]
Really?

[01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:07.500]
So that was why I had to do it but that's not a Jews a lot of Jews in Toronto way

[01:19:07.500 --> 01:19:08.600]

[01:19:08.840 --> 01:19:15.180]
They got a whole sect up there very religious as a matter of fact Bathurstreet right from you go from Bathurstreet

[01:19:15.180 --> 01:19:18.900]
Bathurstreet but I'm up there right through Aiglington right up through

[01:19:18.900 --> 01:19:27.180]
Fields it's all Jewish there yeah there must be I'd say 250,000 yeah a lot of let's see Toronto's got a lot of Jews a lot of fags

[01:19:27.840 --> 01:19:31.720]
Oh they have a chat there the Canadian Homophile Association of Toronto

[01:19:31.720 --> 01:19:36.300]
They have lots of Asians or Oriental's or whatever you want to call me a lot of

[01:19:36.300 --> 01:19:42.880]
Many they have you know the thing at all the thing that I find fascinating is when we were in Rome I pointed out to John

[01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:48.060]
I said you know there's a lot more Middle Eastern people in Toronto than there are in Rome

[01:19:48.060 --> 01:19:50.880]
There's a lot more of times in Toronto than there are in Italy

[01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:57.740]
Well there's a lot there's two like little Italy's in Toronto which is amazing and there's just tons of China towns they're all over the place

[01:19:57.740 --> 01:19:59.980]
I swear you think you're an Asian sometimes

[01:19:59.980 --> 01:20:07.480]
But but I will say this the Asian people who live in Toronto are very much different than the ones who live here

[01:20:07.480 --> 01:20:10.060]
Well I wouldn't know because I haven't lived there in 20 years

[01:20:10.060 --> 01:20:14.520]
But apparently my relatives all say they're very studious hardworking

[01:20:14.520 --> 01:20:20.880]
Well that's generally true with most of them but they're much hipper and much more progressive and much more part of the mainstream

[01:20:20.880 --> 01:20:26.640]
But then again Toronto's a city that works where all the different people seem to get along and coexist in our part of the city

[01:20:26.640 --> 01:20:29.320]
As opposed to here where everybody's in their own little thing

[01:20:29.320 --> 01:20:32.520]
Well it's very cosmopolitan you know it's like New York

[01:20:32.520 --> 01:20:36.800]
Right well without all that without without without that many black people right

[01:20:36.800 --> 01:20:41.980]
That's true well there you'd be surprised there's got to be a hundred thousand Jamaicans Caribbean people up there now

[01:20:41.980 --> 01:20:43.800]
They're Caribbean but they're all driving cams

[01:20:45.180 --> 01:20:48.420]
But no very nice city between July and August

[01:20:48.420 --> 01:20:49.360]
Right yeah

[01:20:49.360 --> 01:20:52.580]
That's why I got down here because I just couldn't fathom the cold anymore

[01:20:53.440 --> 01:20:57.460]
It's just thought I'd call say hello you know I'm non-religious too

[01:20:57.460 --> 01:20:59.160]
There's a lot of us you'd be surprised

[01:21:00.200 --> 01:21:04.820]
No I wouldn't be surprised I think that the number of Jews who are really observant

[01:21:04.820 --> 01:21:11.040]
Except on these high holidays though Russia's shown on you I'm kipper is when all kinds of Jews who the rest of the year couldn't give it damn less

[01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:16.720]
All of a sudden become very religious and they're convinced that because they paid their dues at temple therefore they should go

[01:21:16.720 --> 01:21:23.820]
And they should drag their kids along and they should pop a Yarmulka on their head and they should they should force them to participate in all this meaningless exercise

[01:21:24.440 --> 01:21:29.000]
Exactly well they got to make an appearance for the boss or the who or they this they got to impress everybody

[01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:32.180]
Or the who which I think the who are going to be in the temple okay

[01:21:32.180 --> 01:21:32.860]
Are they Jewish?

[01:21:33.360 --> 01:21:36.300]
How do you enjoy the World Cup? I think it's great hockey

[01:21:36.300 --> 01:21:41.260]
I'm enjoying it a lot and like I said I really I'm not rooting for one country or the other

[01:21:41.260 --> 01:21:43.740]
I'm glad to see it go the full three games for tomorrow night

[01:21:43.740 --> 01:21:49.180]
Yeah but it's just it's just a real treat to see all and I'm going to tell you these guys are not fooling around

[01:21:49.180 --> 01:21:56.880]
Like for last night Lindross and LeClaire who are not only teammates but their line mates on the Legion of Doom on the flyers

[01:21:56.880 --> 01:22:02.500]
They're line mates on the same team during the regular season and they got into it a little bit and Lindross gave them a real shot

[01:22:02.500 --> 01:22:06.800]
I mean these guys are planned for country and it's for real and they mean it

[01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:08.080]
It's been great hockey

[01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:14.220]
It has been did you see time Chery going on on and on about this guy and that guy and all these fake injuries

[01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:19.600]
Yeah loves Bobby or loves Bobby or he's right Bobby or is the greatest player who ever played the game

[01:22:19.600 --> 01:22:21.760]
There's nobody even close he's absolutely right

[01:22:21.760 --> 01:22:26.640]
But I still would take Gordy however Bobby or way well you know why just for longevity

[01:22:27.320 --> 01:22:28.900]
If Bobby or would have played

[01:22:28.900 --> 01:22:33.780]
Yeah but you know it's interesting that he pointed out last night that Bobby or ruined his legs and finished his career

[01:22:33.780 --> 01:22:37.520]
Because he insisted in playing in the whatever it was called Canada Cup

[01:22:38.600 --> 01:22:39.820]
That's what he's very sad

[01:22:39.820 --> 01:22:41.140]
And he wanted for us that year

[01:22:41.720 --> 01:22:44.940]
But that I the Bobby or in Gordy how are both up there

[01:22:44.940 --> 01:22:49.260]
I still would lean a little towards how because in those days there was a little tougher

[01:22:49.260 --> 01:22:52.260]
There was only 16s and there's more longevity there

[01:22:52.920 --> 01:22:56.280]
Well that Bobby or probably was more talented

[01:22:56.280 --> 01:22:57.760]
I'll stick with Jim Dury myself

[01:22:57.760 --> 01:22:59.080]
Have a good one

[01:22:59.080 --> 01:22:59.640]
And back to you

[01:23:00.160 --> 01:23:03.480]
Okay we have two open lines in day 751 WIOD

[01:23:03.480 --> 01:23:06.120]
We have one in Broward like I said these people would know

[01:23:06.900 --> 01:23:08.760]
Merit the Steerheim from Merit Doki

[01:23:10.520 --> 01:23:11.800]
As in Poki

[01:23:11.800 --> 01:23:17.480]
It is astonishing to me maybe it's because of the fact that this area is so geographically isolated

[01:23:17.480 --> 01:23:24.280]
From we were talking about that yesterday while Phil was trying to convince me to go up in the northeast or just get out of here and go somewhere else and work

[01:23:25.100 --> 01:23:32.440]
About the fact that when you live up north or in the Midwest or far west I guess is the same thing too to a lesser degree

[01:23:32.440 --> 01:23:34.860]
Because you're geographically isolated

[01:23:34.860 --> 01:23:42.320]
But the deep south and especially Florida which on radio and you just it's like a cacophony of foreign languages

[01:23:42.320 --> 01:23:48.620]
That you're mostly esponial on AM radio at night and you just don't have any relationship to the other parts to what's going on

[01:23:48.620 --> 01:23:51.400]
And so the things that people are interested in here

[01:23:51.400 --> 01:23:55.960]
It's like when we got the hockey team and I started getting real enthused about it and everybody was talking to me

[01:23:55.960 --> 01:23:59.420]
Oh gee thank you for introducing us to something we never heard of before

[01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:04.140]
Like I was talking a foreign language like they thought oh boy this is really neat

[01:24:04.140 --> 01:24:05.800]
We never knew such a thing existed

[01:24:06.840 --> 01:24:09.380]
Which I find very difficult to comprehend

[01:24:10.340 --> 01:24:13.380]
Here's the Hollywood hello for now no comment

[01:24:15.280 --> 01:24:25.480]
Brilliant very good open line and date 751 WYOD 2 and Broward 5249463 and 2 on a green lines 180944 WYOD

[01:24:25.480 --> 01:24:27.620]
Here's a Pompano hello

[01:24:27.620 --> 01:24:30.340]
Hello yes sir hi good morning you. Where is Diaz?

[01:24:30.440 --> 01:24:35.840]
Buenos Diaz first time caller good love your show I'm a Julio and I still have my turtleneck no

[01:24:35.840 --> 01:24:36.560]
I'm not a single size

[01:24:38.460 --> 01:24:41.220]
Any of those things you got to deal with you know

[01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:48.080]
Neil in reference to your comment a couple of days ago about that we are the world millionaires

[01:24:48.080 --> 01:24:52.640]
That they should have shallow millions instead of singing this stupid sound

[01:24:53.160 --> 01:24:59.240]
Same thing happened that after Andrew when the Estefan went and organized his salsa concert

[01:25:00.020 --> 01:25:05.640]
And instead of shelling out their couple of millions they went out and organized the salsa concert

[01:25:06.200 --> 01:25:10.380]
Yeah these these performers are making hundreds of millions of dollars

[01:25:10.380 --> 01:25:13.180]
They had a thing on the other day this fat Oprah Winfrey bitch

[01:25:13.180 --> 01:25:18.520]
She made I think a hundred and seventeen million last year some obscene amount for what I have no idea

[01:25:18.520 --> 01:25:25.200]
And you know they could as a tax write off each donate a million to a variety of different charities

[01:25:25.200 --> 01:25:31.040]
Instead of like putting on this act which they do for public relations to give the appearance that they're so concerned

[01:25:31.040 --> 01:25:33.900]
And they're such great activists and they're so right

[01:25:34.500 --> 01:25:39.940]
Like Michael Jackson is so concerned about the children of the world which he is if he can do them and he's attracted to him

[01:25:39.940 --> 01:25:41.860]
But other than that that's the extent of his interest

[01:25:41.860 --> 01:25:47.460]
That's true actually I was leaving in New York you remember when the Estefan had the accident that she heard her back

[01:25:47.460 --> 01:25:48.120]
Yeah

[01:25:48.120 --> 01:25:51.320]
Well she was admitted to a hospital in New York I was leaving there

[01:25:51.320 --> 01:25:57.660]
And in New York City most of the hospital has Filipino nurses like 75% of the nurses are from the Philippines

[01:25:57.660 --> 01:26:02.360]
And this lady was so thankful for the nursing care that she received

[01:26:02.360 --> 01:26:09.580]
That instead of even a check to the nurses she went out and donate $10,000 to the government of the Philippines

[01:26:09.580 --> 01:26:14.840]
What would the 50 million poor people the Philippines were going to do with the $10,000?

[01:26:14.900 --> 01:26:18.640]
I'll tell you she could have bought a lot of pairs of shoes for those Filipino nurses with ten grand

[01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:25.300]
Exactly and you're short of your mouth but most of the Hispanic newspapers are ready when crazy

[01:26:25.300 --> 01:26:32.760]
They just look her from head to toe even when they killed that guy in the boat you know they just they're just obsessed with her

[01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:33.820]
Oh my god, they can't get me

[01:26:33.820 --> 01:26:39.520]
Rick Sanchez goes out and runs a guy over in his car and right away they're picking on poor Rick Sanchez because the guy died just in case you didn't know

[01:26:39.520 --> 01:26:45.160]
But Gloria and her husband they go out there and they kill some guy on a speedboat and right away she's a great activist

[01:26:45.160 --> 01:26:49.860]
And she's worried about boating safety or the boat of them are great people etc and so on

[01:26:49.860 --> 01:26:52.640]
It's like a saint I mean she can do no wrong

[01:26:53.160 --> 01:26:58.860]
Yeah I think she's well well well overblown I mean it's not like Luis Miguel I mean he's talked to Hispanic

[01:26:58.860 --> 01:27:01.620]
I don't know if he's overblown or not but I like it

[01:27:01.620 --> 01:27:07.100]
No but when he's been seeing all the Spanish songs and he's thick with his Spanish songs

[01:27:07.100 --> 01:27:12.160]
He never went to the like the famous crossover where we're looking for the you know

[01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:18.680]
No but you're wrong about that I mean I'd be the first one to defend Luis but the only reason that they have resisted that is because he can't speak English

[01:27:18.680 --> 01:27:26.400]
I mean he speaks very wet-back English and you notice it had one rendition of America he sings a couple of choruses there in English

[01:27:26.400 --> 01:27:32.480]
But that's about the extent of it and they just you know it's really sad too because he grew up in an entertainment family

[01:27:32.480 --> 01:27:37.680]
His father was Luis Reyes I'm sure you know and you would have thought that since he was like a singer and movie guy

[01:27:37.680 --> 01:27:41.680]
And it from being in a kid that one of the things if they had a little bit of vision

[01:27:41.680 --> 01:27:45.900]
They would have taught him English from when he was a kid when it's much easier to learn another language

[01:27:45.900 --> 01:27:51.700]
Yeah but it's unfortunately an impediment although he's no matter Italy, Spain, wherever he go all over the world

[01:27:51.700 --> 01:27:54.180]
He's gigantic so he's still making a few papers

[01:27:54.600 --> 01:27:59.260]
Anyway I love your show and I hope you don't have a bunch of calls now from his Spanish songs and communist

[01:27:59.260 --> 01:28:02.460]
I go on Easter because we offended the difference

[01:28:02.460 --> 01:28:03.540]
Too bad

[01:28:04.660 --> 01:28:05.980]
Take care and he'll have a good weekend

[01:28:05.980 --> 01:28:06.540]
And back to you

[01:28:07.420 --> 01:28:13.500]
Okay boy it's really grim today man it is really grim they must all either be at Rosa Lopez's house or on a way to shoulder

[01:28:13.500 --> 01:28:16.020]
And I one or the other it is very very grim

[01:28:16.720 --> 01:28:22.640]
And I don't understand please don't tell me that you don't have an opinion on all these different things that I've been asking about

[01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:25.000]
It's not possible it isn't possible

[01:28:26.460 --> 01:28:31.060]
But they just it's like the thing with Hank Goldberg and all of a sudden the thing with Phil Henry

[01:28:31.060 --> 01:28:38.200]
All of a sudden all these people who have been for the last two years resisting and fighting me every time I tell him that nobody in their right mind with a sense of humor

[01:28:38.200 --> 01:28:42.000]
And any taste whatsoever would be listening to the Humper at the same time that Phil was on

[01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:47.960]
And now yesterday they're coming on and well you know Rick you suck and Neil you're okay while we're doing the gardening you know you're like an old soft shoe

[01:28:47.960 --> 01:28:49.960]
But Phil's the greatest thing in the history of the market

[01:28:50.420 --> 01:28:55.520]
Why is it now that he's leaving they finally are discovering this as opposed to why I was trying to sell it to him

[01:28:55.520 --> 01:29:00.180]
Oh well you know the Humper Humper what the Humper blows
