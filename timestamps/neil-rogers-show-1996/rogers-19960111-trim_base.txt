[00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:04.740]
I've been doing this a long time. I know how to do a talk. I've been doing this a long time. I know how to do a talk.

[00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:05.880]
I'm gonna do no

[00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:12.860]
Police stop my car

[00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:16.880]
Police stop my car. No

[00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.300]
Yeah, police made me stop walk a straight line and blow a balloon

[00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.860]
No, police stop my car

[00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.520]
Police made me stop walk a straight line and blow a balloon

[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.080]
I'm in the first place

[00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:41.300]
No, no

[00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:50.800]
No, they say they're just making sure that they're not going to be able to do it.

[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.780]
There's no open bars in my car

[00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.240]
No, police rode a black

[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.680]
Police rode a black

[00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.020]
Police rode a black I can smell their donuts and they smell my breath

[00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.720]
No, police rode a black

[00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:29.360]
Police rode a black I can smell their donuts and they smell my breath

[00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.860]
They want to wish me a sober Christmas

[00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.360]
That's why they always call me over Christmas

[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.620]
They don't let me out on bail

[00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:43.460]
This Christmas from the bottom of their heart

[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.360]
Police love me up

[00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.820]
Police love me up

[00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:52.980]
They police love me up

[00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.040]

[00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.240]
So there were those long pussy stuff there like that jackass from Alabama and Cove

[00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.360]
Let him stay there

[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.400]
With a banjo on his ass

[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.520]
Yes, clue, though

[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:53.740]

[00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.020]
Miami Top

[00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.040]
Miami Top

[00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.440]
Miami Top

[00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:05.720]
Okay, so he's going to sell out our hockey team so he's lied a lot, he's got a bad complex and he's got a really freaky bad ball to head

[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:11.180]
But doesn't everybody in town want to say thank you to Wayne for doing the right thing with the dolphins today? No, why not?

[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.420]
Why the hell not? Don't you want to get on your hands and knees for Wayne? No, why not?

[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.740]
God damn it. No, all right

[00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:24.040]
So anyway, here we are it's 1009 at WIOD happy Thursday to you. I'm ecstatic

[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.600]
I'm getting my dolphin season tickets again. I'm going to be the most enthusiastic fan

[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:33.340]
This isn't the case of jumping on and off the bandwagon. This is a case of doing something based on principle

[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.080]
We don't need a bunch of sourpuses out there. Let's get somebody with a good sense of humor like Jimmy

[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.860]
Well, he may not have a good sense of humor when it comes to the game itself

[00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.140]
But I think that he's like a little more in touch with reality with like what's going on around him?

[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.620]
And all you people out there that were so recalcitrant all that time. I don't I don't understand it. I don't get it

[00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:58.100]
They took that pool like about four weeks before the end of the season almost everybody they wanted Jimmy and they wanted Shula out

[00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.540]
Wayne finally did something great and I think it's national. Thank you day

[00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:05.700]
Everybody in his town should call up and say thank you Wayne. No, why not?

[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:07.100]
Come on

[00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:12.240]
Show that spirit. It's the 11th of the goddamn January. Let's make a New Year's resolution

[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:18.520]
We're going to support these dolphins now winner lose thicker thin as long as we got a coach who's alive sounds good to me

[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.840]
Even if he does keep Gary Stevens, which I can't imagine why he's gonna do that

[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.440]
But that's what the rumor is who cares

[00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:28.260]
At least he might kick him in a pants a little bit and wake his ass up and say guess what that?

[00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:32.380]
Yard and half and a cloud of dust and throw in 60 bombs again. They're not going to get the job done

[00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.720]
So are we ready to really celebrate no

[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:36.200]
Damn it

[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:41.320]
I'm celebrating Melissa Rogiari and Eric and you do it every week. Melissa. You're a beautiful

[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:44.640]
You're predictable and a beautiful thing you piece of turd you first of all

[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:50.360]
She's got a big thing about his bill Tanner coming back to town. You think Bill Tanner's coming back? No, I don't either not if he's smart

[00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:52.940]
Because I think all those kids grew up anyway

[00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:59.500]
But anyway and that goes on about why 100 of course on air, which is another that's just another David Ross thing

[00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:05.800]
You know and then we hear about JNO which nobody here cares about in John Pocano who's the ops manager at whoa-oh in Fort Wayne

[00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:10.400]
Home of the Fort Wayne comments hockey broadcast for many many years and maybe it still is I don't know

[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.600]
And then we get a thing about love 94 and then if this is the best part

[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:21.020]
If you haven't caught them yet the WIOD AM 610 musketeers Neil Rogers Phil Henry and Rick and Sets will be at the adventure of borders books and music

[00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:25.920]
Saturday from noon to 2 p.m. Selling their best of CDs and cassettes which benefits center one

[00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:29.840]
She actually got all the info right to right time to right place nice go on Melissa sweetheart

[00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:34.380]
And I know you're listening right now in fact it's obvious from this column you're listening to WIOD every day

[00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:37.800]
Even while I'd brought up from big as whispering in your ass in your ear

[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:47.360]
Speaking of Rogers he says anyone catch Larry King on Henry show on Monday calling WIOD the worst talk radio station in the nation and Rogers the worst talk show host ever

[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:50.740]
Anybody catch that no as if that's the big story

[00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:57.260]
Another little shot in there right Melissa. I'm proud like I said yesterday. That's the proudest moment in my life

[00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.680]
To be vilified by a petulant Larry King

[00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:06.940]
Who just can't take the fact that there's anybody in this country got the balls to a finger him the way that I have

[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:08.440]
And he liked it. No

[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:09.680]
Yes, he did

[00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:14.820]
So thank you Melissa for if nothing else at least being consistent our center one total look at that

[00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:22.560]
130,000 341 rovert that 130 hump and we got like 20 days to go and we need a little under 20 grand to get to our 150 goal

[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:27.940]
Which I think we're gonna do because guess what as Melissa says this Saturday will be at borders in adventura noon to 2 at

[00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:31.300]
199th in Biscayne in North of date up there and that should be great

[00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:34.860]
We should have like a line of people up there kissing our rings

[00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:42.000]
For saying thank you for like bringing about public pressure and being responsible for one of the greatest moments in the history of this community. No, yes

[00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:45.720]
So it's 1013 at W. I. O. D

[00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:50.720]
Make him swear like Brian

[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:59.540]
Pack his breakfast in his grip

[00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:01.980]
Hit him off this sinking ship

[00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:09.480]
I

[00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:12.820]
So

[00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:18.280]
Yes, century village once him but he's not a Jew boy

[00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:24.080]
It's been great to be around get the hell out of Miami town. Yes

[00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:29.060]
So

[00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:30.080]
I

[00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:36.780]
Any way to we take up up for my

[00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:41.460]
Come on. Let's have a party here today. No. Yes. No

[00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:46.640]
1016 at W. I. O. D. No, we have all the day lines wide open here

[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:48.440]
We're telling him to stay and are two people ecstatic

[00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:52.000]
This is the day you've been waiting for it's gonna be official today four o'clock this afternoon

[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.860]
The guy would all that big freaky here is gonna be here Jimmy Johnson who drives a beautiful Corvette

[00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:59.340]
Even if it is filthy needs to be washed desperately which everybody can see that

[00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:04.920]
751 W. I. D. Come on. Let's let's have a little enthusiasm here. No. Yes. No

[00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:09.080]
God damn it. What's wrong with you people you saw our pie in his town, huh?

[00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:13.840]
This was so important everybody. I was asking that whole day that one day I kept asking

[00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:18.540]
Why is this so important? It's a football coach and evidently people got upset about that because it is important

[00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:23.980]
That's all we got here look at those day lines. Let's have a party. No come on wake up get with it. No

[00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:25.500]
You mothers

[00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:28.120]
Come on just one time. Okay. No

[00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:36.860]
Here's Lake Worth on the purple line. Hello. Hey, good morning. Neil. Yes, sir. I'd like to thank you first of all for all the good times in South Florida and

[00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:40.640]
Well, you're welcome. Welcome to the worst talk show in America

[00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:42.500]
Hey, you got that

[00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:45.720]
The only the only time I miss this show is

[00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:51.740]
When I have to leave our Florida because I am a truck driver, but other than that, I'm okay. Yeah

[00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:58.500]
You think I'm gonna call the Jimmy thing. Yes, I am static about it. I'm a dolphin fan and

[00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:02.380]
It was not a surprise to me. I thought that that was the right thing

[00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:08.240]
I say that we buy that all the tickets in that stadium all the season tickets should be sold out as soon as the announcements official

[00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:13.900]
Before this afternoon everybody should buy season tickets and sell out J. R. S. just like the Patriots did last year

[00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:19.380]
Even before they start okay and winner lose through thick and thin and it's gonna take him a couple of years

[00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:24.420]
He ain't gonna perform a miracle overnight. We go out there and show a little enthusiasm for a guy at least that's alive

[00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:29.280]
I'd say one thing we have a better balance than what he had left after the

[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:30.040]
laundry

[00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:35.160]
Go to get dragon on and dragon on why we didn't have no one on 15 season here

[00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:38.100]
Or three and 13 or whatever the hell it was

[00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:42.500]
It was three and 13 and then Jimmy was one and 15 regardless of that

[00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:45.720]
I think that he can do something a lot quicker than one year and even though

[00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:51.140]
I said it happens in two years. We'll have fun in those two years and I know he's gonna pack it in because no

[00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:55.980]
We're gonna be playing a great football this year. No in this coming year and

[00:10:55.980 --> 00:11:00.540]
Hey, I'm looking forward to going and see you at the games because I definitely want to be

[00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:03.300]
Seasick and holders all right and

[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:08.820]
Hey, I think it's gonna be happening back in Miami and the dolphins are gonna be right on the top. No

[00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:13.900]
All right, I'm with you pal. Thank you. I'll see you there right on the 50-yard line. Well be

[00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:19.820]
Well, it's done the 50-yard on the four section but way up there you come and wave just throw some crap down

[00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:24.800]
Just throw some cups down with little bit of schmutz in them. We'll be up there. Okay, pal. Have a great life

[00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:29.580]
Purple line is open. That's now the everybody a mobile line for all you

[00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:36.140]
Mobile one and AT&T wireless customers and those of you who don't like any more BS on your cellular phone at pound iod

[00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:40.380]
We got the whole deal going out for everybody. You're not closed out anymore. Are we pay for it? How do you like that?

[00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:46.240]
That thing should be smoking these days just like our listeners. Speaking of that here's a lady in oh, we got to do the mobile on their dime

[00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:47.680]
How come you called on your dime

[00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:51.140]
Hello, how you doing? Yes, sir? Oh

[00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:55.020]
Listen, this is the bad news that I heard in a long long time. No

[00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:59.260]
And for the first time I agree with something with you. Yeah, always listen to you

[00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:03.460]
But I never call and I like to show you if you wait long enough sooner or later will agree on something

[00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:07.620]
How do you like that if you just give me a chance? Give me 20 years and we'll agree on one thing anyway

[00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:11.860]
That's probably I'm not you for your courage and and the way you talk to people

[00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:14.820]
That's right. Tell me like it a like it that might be

[00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:20.200]
Oh, I think it's wonderful. All right. I'm glad you're happy pal. You're gonna be there at some of the games

[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:22.620]
You're gonna give us your tangible support

[00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:27.260]
Listen, I'm a diehard dolphin. All right, and these stars will be excited

[00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:33.680]
We all a lot of respect to Shula, but it's time for a big change time time to change those undies right? That's right

[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:36.100]
We need a big winner. I think we're in the right track now

[00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:38.180]
All right, see you there, pali

[00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:41.240]
Thank you much audio's I'll read the darch whatever you are

[00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:45.640]
We have an open line in date 751. We go on on the green line. I I want to see trop

[00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:49.100]
I mean I'm real outpouring even before the official announcement

[00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:52.520]
And I'm proud of the fact that I was well

[00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:57.100]
I had enough foresight to tell you four or five years ago that we were on a steep decline at this bs

[00:12:57.100 --> 00:13:01.100]
Are continuing to to lead people by the nose out there and tell you oh something's gonna happen

[00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:03.560]
By the way to panther defense sucks. I just want you to know that

[00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:06.540]
Three nothing lead last night then four two in the third period

[00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:09.620]
I'm gonna tell you another thing that Jovenowski man. You got to clear it out of your zone

[00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:14.020]
You can't play like that Eddie. Okay. You're a little on the week side these days. You're gonna be good someday

[00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:20.040]
But not right now and then the the geezer plays great. He does this all the time play great the whole game and letting one greasy

[00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:23.500]
Goal that tied the game where we wind up with one points that we should have two

[00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:24.900]
But hey, we'll be okay

[00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:27.600]
We're still doing pretty damn good our panthers

[00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:32.440]
They're you know, and then there's the article here which almost makes me believe which it's wishful thinking on my part

[00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:33.920]
I keep reading these things about

[00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:42.220]
The arena and about they're gonna have their good browards gonna get their act together and before it's like the end of the year

[00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:46.320]
And the proposed arena may do this and may do that and they're gonna make a decision on

[00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:50.980]
By the 30th or 31st of the month and then before the deadline that wait is imposed

[00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:55.460]
So maybe we can actually almost like Wayne a little bit of something good happens. Oh, well, maybe you're right

[00:13:55.460 --> 00:14:00.160]
Maybe I'm getting carried away. I'm just in one of those positive moods for one time because for crying out loud

[00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:02.760]
What else are we gone here except a lot of drugs in South Beach

[00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:05.320]
Yeah, that's like I said yesterday

[00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:10.940]
They had a big thing on channel seven news which I go desperate. I'm even watching. I will confess channel seven news now a lot

[00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:17.340]
I'm embarrassed to be watching it but not to embarrass to admit it because I will not watch channel four since they fired my friend barber

[00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:21.120]
The best I would never watch channel six with that slays suspended Tony Segredo

[00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:27.080]
And I might watch channel 10 news if they didn't had that Jimmy syphilis on air and syphilitis

[00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:33.620]
But so anyway, they had a big thing about all the bars especially the gay bars being rated on South Beach because they're looking for drugs

[00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:36.260]
I mean don't they understand that's all there is over there is like

[00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:41.460]
drugs in South Beach and a lot of pretty bodies all stuck up and mostly fags anyway

[00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:47.000]
But what so what's the big shock over there? Oh, there's drugs on South Beach. What a concept we just discovered it

[00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:52.500]
Anyway, so we got nothing else good going on. We got Jimmy Johnson signing two day

[00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:54.120]
Everything's gonna be phenomenal

[00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:58.200]
We don't care if the market goes down another hundred points. We're not worried about small potatoes like that

[00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:02.040]
We don't care if Hillary a hezzer finger in a cookie jar. We don't care what's going on

[00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:09.080]
We care about the fact that something good finally might be going on here that we all want even if we don't give a crap about the dolphins or football or anything else

[00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:13.680]
Something we're like making a movement into the 20th century no 1023 at WIOD

[00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:16.840]
News talk an entertainment radio

[00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:25.700]
610 WIOD the worst talk radio I've ever heard in my life is on W out no the worst talk radio I've ever heard in my life is on W out no

[00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:27.980]
This station stands for nothing

[00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:35.380]
Huh build doesn't have a clue

[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.720]
We dare to call him leader

[00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:39.600]
No

[00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:44.380]
About those roles

[00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:45.900]
That no

[00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:48.640]
But something's not complete

[00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:51.660]
Since 92 in November

[00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:52.940]
Yeah

[00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:56.480]
Cause this wild wife's

[00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:59.120]
Is our minds

[00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:03.140]
And everything's in so discrete

[00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:11.160]
But she's lying through his teeth. No people catching catching them cheat and just denied

[00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:11.300]
And I

[00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:15.500]
So

[00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:18.780]
So

[00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:22.340]
Hillary

[00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:24.720]
It's calling

[00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:33.300]
No, okay, 1028 at WIOD I love that WIOD George is taking a dump or something. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir

[00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:34.780]

[00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:36.300]
Okay

[00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:37.520]
Listen, I saw the Toronto

[00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:40.840]
What kind of a phone are you on you got like a cozy over that thing or one?

[00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:43.240]
The portable inside the worst

[00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:46.200]
I saw the highlights of Toronto game last night

[00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:49.760]
What do you mean I see the highlights I have the game I saw the game

[00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:52.140]
I saw the games

[00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:52.480]
Oh

[00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:56.380]
It games over 500 were kicking ass baby

[00:16:56.380 --> 00:16:59.340]
Hey, that was a physical game Matt Sundin is God

[00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:01.880]
It was great

[00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:07.360]
No, yes

[00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:10.720]
No, no, okay

[00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:17.640]
That's all I'm out there telling me yes again. Okay. Yes. No. Yes. Okay pal. Okay. Go leave. Go later. See you

[00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:22.260]
Tidome and Ken Baumgartner and that's the kind of guys he likes in Jamie Macau

[00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:24.180]
And he likes as an Sergio Momezzo

[00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:27.940]
He likes those goons out there that the enforcers that's right

[00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:31.360]
The Lisa are making a big move baby. You can almost smell it

[00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:34.800]
We have an open line in date. I don't want to see no open lines here today

[00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:37.780]
I'll tell you that we're having a big party. We're celebrating. I'm gonna be positive

[00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:43.400]
You people are the ones you know, I've been punching around since the yesterday since it became very obvious even the Jimmy's mother

[00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:48.520]
That he's gonna be here. It's official. He's gonna shave off his head and have a ball spot

[00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:53.100]
And I'm flipping around and there's like no enthusiasm. This is what everybody wanted

[00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:55.400]
They've been talking about it. You could puke from all the

[00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:59.500]
speculation that was going on there was even speculation going on in date county

[00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:02.720]
And now it's like, uh, yeah, who cares

[00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:09.220]
Bunch of sourpuses is what we got here. We finally got something good to grab onto something to be positive about

[00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:12.000]
And what do they got to say about it basically nothing

[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.160]
Look at that even at purple line, which is now for everybody that even used to have a cellular phone

[00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:20.620]
Even if you don't still have it pound i.o.d that thing is open one in date

[00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:22.360]
751 w.i.o.d

[00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:26.520]
We should have these phones should be smoking off the hook with Jimmy I just today

[00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:30.640]
Sand thank you so much Wayne for finally doing something that we wanted no

[00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:32.600]
Here's for Lauderdale. Hello

[00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:39.960]
Feel how you doing okay, sir. Hey listen. I cannot thank Wayne without thanking you at the same time. That's right inseparable thanks

[00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:45.460]
But the way in and I are inseparable. No, no, I wouldn't go that far. Yeah, but neither also listen

[00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:49.200]
I don't like that complexion. Yeah, listen. You know how you've been talking about though, you know

[00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:50.960]
Wayne in the dolphins for a few years

[00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:58.020]
Why are they giving Joe Rose? You know, I mean why they talking like he's the one who was negative about about the guy

[00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:02.400]
You know at least you know, I mean you say to right why is who talking well you know on that station. I listen a little bit

[00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:02.960]
I have to admit

[00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:09.680]
Uh, you know, but they keep pumping up Joe like you know, you were the only one negative and you were yeah right right right

[00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:14.200]
What do you make of that? Mm-hmm. What do I make of that that they're full of crap like they always are is what I make of it

[00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:16.840]
Yeah, anybody with two ears knows better than that

[00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:21.780]
Yeah, but they believe it. Yeah, no, they don't believe it. They don't believe they don't believe anything that they say

[00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:24.820]
They also don't believe that they're going to have any great numbers that they have any listeners

[00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:27.640]
They don't believe any of that they know that they're desperate over there

[00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:32.360]
Which is why they keep trying to rip us off they even have now attitude liners if you listen to their station

[00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:36.780]
Which I do every now and then they have attitude liners like we do which I'm embarrassed about ours

[00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:41.960]
You know like well, you know, we're the uh asshole station whatever that is whatever they say now

[00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:48.780]
What about what about their segue going from uh, you know that the shoeless sucking to now the Jimmy's sucking in less than a week?

[00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:51.400]
Yeah, I mean, you know that's not a no credibility

[00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:55.800]
Which they never had in the first place and I will give credit where credit is due because he is listening

[00:19:55.800 --> 00:20:00.100]
And that is that fat the a Hummer the fat Hummer over there did break the story before anybody

[00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:04.560]
And now his good buddy suspended Tony on there they even got promos on channel six

[00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:06.520]
Tony cigarette oh broke the story first

[00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:09.000]
He did not the Hummer broke the story

[00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:14.780]
All right, so how do you like that? I like it goes to show that everybody in this town is full of crap. No except me

[00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:17.380]
And me right all right. Thank you. Okay, pal

[00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:21.640]
Yeah, let's stand up for once right just for once in our lives. Let's stand up and be counted

[00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:26.080]
Oh, we have an open line and Broward five two four W. I. Would be we go one in the green line there

[00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:32.420]
Where the drunk lady finally passed on on the floor with her bottle of Vagram Al-Boon at one eight hundred nine four four nine four six three

[00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:36.720]
one eight hundred nine four four W. I. Would be this is a great day market on a calendar

[00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:41.340]
It's beautiful out there the sun is shining. It's like 70 something degrees. It's gonna be fantastic

[00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:43.080]
We got reason to have a smile on our pus

[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:49.220]
Something just good happen. That's all it doesn't make any difference. What it has to do with it. Just something good

[00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:54.960]
When's the last time you can remember something good happening here, huh? When's the last time

[00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:58.480]
Maybe March 1st 1976 when I came to town

[00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:03.720]
Since then not too much while we got the Panthers. We got the Marlins. We got the heat

[00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:08.140]
That was pretty good if you're a sports fan, but this transcends that

[00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:11.060]
This transcends it by miles

[00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:18.480]
Here's uh, doesn't it here's pop it OB tello. Yeah, sir party buddy. It's right. All right

[00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:22.000]
Did you see what kind of car he was driving? Yes, sir. That Corvette a nice dirty Corvette

[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:26.180]
Now we can afford to get that thing washed now that he doesn't have to depend on that money from Fox anymore

[00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:30.680]
I's got a real income coming in he can get Spencer to watch it. There you go good idea. I like that

[00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:34.960]
Hey, uh, you're absolutely right because uh, I'm a season ticket holder that

[00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:39.460]
Last year was my first year and if uh, Shul was coming back this year, I wasn't renewing

[00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:45.220]
I know a lot of people like that who were just at the rope sand they have no more and wanted no more of it

[00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:49.840]
I will be now though definitely no great. I mean, it's worth the money to know that you know

[00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:52.100]
You got a guy that can put a team together and

[00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:59.220]
At least there's an effort being made to bring in a guy who's had great success who like is in the 20th century

[00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:05.800]
Is not gonna put up with Brian Cox's annex isn't gonna put up with any bull crap is in control is in charge and is like

[00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:11.260]
You know what I'm saying is a motivator instead of a guy who's trying to live off his past successes from 20 years ago

[00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:14.740]
Stand it around with his arms folded like wondering what's going on. Yeah, exactly

[00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:20.080]
He might actually be uh jager will actually be involved in the game right there. You go wouldn't that be something exciting

[00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:24.640]
And now we need is uh because it looks like you know, he might be keeping uh Gary Steve and hopefully you can

[00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:29.880]
Kick him in the ass a little bit and get him to stop running that shovel pass and maybe get him to run some more running plays there

[00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:32.620]
Yeah, we might be in good shape and I want to say it again, you know

[00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:35.480]
Emmett Smith has got like one more year and there is a free agent

[00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:36.940]
I know a lot of people are talking about that. He'll be a free agent

[00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:41.340]
I wouldn't be at all surprised wouldn't that be I would get on my hands and ease and kiss the ground

[00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:46.140]
Yeah, if the dolphins had a running back who could like actually run more than like a yard and a half at a time

[00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:50.360]
Against the good team. It's all really near the running back in a good defensive pass rush

[00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:52.100]
You know, and I mean, you know, we'll be right up there

[00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:56.100]
Yeah, an offensive line a defensive line with a pass rush a middle line backer wasn't

[00:22:56.100 --> 00:23:01.980]
You know spitting at the crowd right and maybe a secondary that isn't as porous as a sieve which is a lot of work needs to be done

[00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:05.320]
And another thing I wanted to say kind of a request here

[00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:11.020]
Um, I know we've been talking about what's the name Larry King all week when I really talking about it. Larry who? No

[00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:12.520]
See it Jeff

[00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:17.500]
Um, did anybody request that I've got a ball spot instead of under the board lock that song

[00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:21.220]
Oh, what is that called by the way, Jura?

[00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:26.360]
It's called balled spot. I don't think I heard it all week. What a strange name that is. Okay, you got it

[00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:28.400]
Thanks a lot buddy and have a great line for you too

[00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:32.080]
We have an open line and Broward. We're starting to get these bastards awake here today

[00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:36.780]
I'm not just gonna sit back here. I'm turning on the sports show. They're talking about the heat. They're talking about

[00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:40.440]
Kakai. They're talking about what's wrong with you people, huh?

[00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:42.660]
What's wrong with you

[00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:47.700]
She was the best piece of ass I ever had in my life to be perfectly frank

[00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:52.620]
And a man in my position can't afford to be made to look ridiculous. What's wrong with you

[00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:56.740]
Are you losing your senses or what

[00:23:57.620 --> 00:24:03.020]
We got an open line there on a green line in Palm Beach and if there's somebody who's not drunk beside that crazy bitch that called before

[00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:07.060]
You can use it right now. We pay for it. How do you like that? Do you like it or not

[00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:10.620]

And when my employees laugh at me I wish I were dead

[00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:06.160]

[00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:09.920]
And top of me

[00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:14.920]
Should I paint it?

[00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:19.320]
When it's a cover it's all up to me

[00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:24.420]
He's got a ball spot

[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.360]
Just like a billion balls

[00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:31.960]
I feel three inches tall

[00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:36.520]
Please help me run bobe

[00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:42.960]
I know how Larry King feels he's got a ball spot

[00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:44.720]
Ball spot

[00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:52.400]
Oh when I painted my head my wife she said she's out of here

[00:25:54.480 --> 00:26:01.120]
And when I go to the John the guys are using my head for a mirror

[00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:03.080]
Yep it

[00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:15.140]
Should I paint it?

[00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:19.640]
Plans and top cover it it's all up to me

[00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:27.420]
He's got a ball spot just like a billion balls

[00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:31.080]
I feel three inches

[00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:36.200]
Please help me run bobe

[00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:41.100]
I know how Larry King feels

[00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:42.860]
He's got a ball spot

[00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:48.420]
1042 a WID you think he really knows how Larry King feels

[00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:51.840]
So we got two open lines and date where they dropped off to show the tremendous

[00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:54.960]
Would date is where the problem is that's where the enthusiasm is lacking

[00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:57.980]
Because all the Julios they don't know from Ymi Yansen that's the problem

[00:26:57.980 --> 00:27:00.800]
I got news for a Yansen place for the Leafs okay

[00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:02.580]
So anyway

[00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:06.020]
We got some good stuff here from our friends at the Amish country

[00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:09.080]
The natural cheese people is that the natural cheeses people

[00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:16.280]
And I got some of their Havardi with Dill and some of their Swiss with almost no carbohydrates by the way also some sliced boar heads boar's head

[00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:18.960]

Hmm kind of second just a little snack mom don't get panicky okay

[00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:25.500]
Just a nice little snack with almost zero carbs here this morning

[00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:31.240]
And I'm back on the Atkins and I'm feeling great and I'm just full of it today. I am loaded with it

[00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:34.420]
Got that chees just like melting your mouth those cheeses

[00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:38.160]
Here's the Aladian Lake worth that George is a so fond of hello

[00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:40.160]
Hello

[00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:43.400]
What happened in the Ladian Lake worth

[00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:44.700]
Hello

[00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:48.640]
I just talked to her what do you mean you just talked to her

[00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:49.900]
Hello

[00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:51.920]
Like seconds ago. Yeah

[00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:57.040]
Well, she's drunk okay leave that bitch alone okay put around her do something with her stick around hold

[00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:01.340]
Let's go to a deer field hello. She's probably having a party over Jimmy hello

[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:02.880]
deer field

[00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:05.200]
Oh

[00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:10.300]
It would help if I pressed the button hello. Well, I got so excited about the drunk lady that I got my finger on it

[00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:15.300]
Oh, it's excited. Yeah, Neil. This is a great day. I'm glad he's finally announcing it. Yeah

[00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:22.560]
Best things ever happened to offer both team in 20 some years. Yes, as far as Lara Kea's concern. He's blown for 20 so far

[00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:22.840]
No

[00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:31.180]
Now I was unfortunately stuck listening to him early mornings about five years ago. Yeah, we used to we I would do you use the carrier?

[00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:31.960]
We us

[00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:44.960]
And last thing I heard his radio show is vanished you can't find that anywhere can you no right?

[00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:50.160]
That would be a plus. Yeah, there would be a definite no it is a plus his radio show is off because he went on the afternoon

[00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:55.420]
Because mutual couldn't make any money on an all-night show which figures and so they they put about an afternoon driver

[00:28:55.420 --> 00:28:58.820]
They would thought that all the stations in America would drop their afternoon drive shows

[00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:03.100]
Including us to put that bald headed geek on a ear and they all said the same thing no

[00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:08.980]
Yeah, I had a chance to watch a big Wilson. Yeah, he was lame. He might have been nice

[00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:12.240]
He was a good guy, but he was not one of the greatest entertainers. That's right

[00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:16.460]
You knew him. I didn't have a chance to meet him, but he was he might have been as nice as a day as long

[00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:20.320]
But he was lame he played the piano and he did tinkle a lot on that piano

[00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:24.340]
He tinkled all over everybody was a good guy. I like big he was a friend of mine and I liked him

[00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:28.160]
But he shows sucked you know, let's be honest. That's for sure. Right. That's for sure Neil

[00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:33.560]
Thank you, and that's Larry's idea of talk radio is going back to that stuff from before Jesus was a baby

[00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:38.960]
That's why I like Shula so much. He likes all the old guys from a before you know, Methusla the big smooch

[00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:42.320]
Big ass kisser. He used to put me to sleep at three o'clock in the morning. Oh no

[00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:46.640]
I was trying to deliver blood now to end up having car accidents because that's why we hit him on the ear

[00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:50.260]
It was better than taking all those pills. He's always pedaling

[00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:56.100]
And that helps you okay, pali. Bye. Have a great day pali see. I'm starting to say that now too pali

[00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:57.520]
Oh god, do I hate that

[00:29:58.120 --> 00:30:04.240]
Jeff Ly says that all the time and it's always so insincere to hey pali. I'll get out of here you silly goose

[00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:10.680]
Open line and day 751 one and brown that center one total is 130,000 341

[00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:13.520]
Don't forget get into your borders books music and cafes stores

[00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:19.060]
You still got 20 days three weeks to go before our campaign ends the end of January and we'll be at the borders and have a tour of this

[00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:21.500]
Saturday noon to two fill and Rick and suds and me

[00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:25.580]
And we want to make that 150 grand so bad we can almost taste it we could smell it

[00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:29.260]
Here's the facts that says Rick and suds near Rogers and Phil Henry spelled right

[00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:36.120]
On behalf of national thank you day. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for not mentioning a damn thing about effing oj's video

[00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:40.960]
It seems that every damn channel had some crap to say about it last night shame on them

[00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:45.620]
We love you all environmental recycling ink. We love you guys too. No. Yes, we do

[00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:53.160]
OJ's video now oj can wipe his ass with it. Okay, and anybody that goes out there and buys that video will be shot on site. Okay

[00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:56.940]
29 bucks to hear the man lies some more haven't you heard him lie enough yet?

[00:30:57.180 --> 00:31:06.280]
Haven't heard enough lies about oj? No, yeah, there's the guy that had Bobby Shapiro on and every one of those god damn grave robbing lawyers on his show and just love sucking their ass. No, yes

[00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:14.760]
Let's do a mobile in Fort Lauderdale. Hello. Hi Neil. Yes, sir. How are you doing great welcome to our party, sir? Well, thank you

[00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:17.540]
Would you like to talk hockey for just a minute? Sure, whatever you like

[00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:21.500]
You know what I've got a point last night and a leaf's got a couple. We'll take whatever we can get

[00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:26.040]
What about Gord Murphy, huh? He's he's the Goli defenseman. We got he is his phenomenal

[00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:30.560]
Love Gord Murphy when I was watching that game when they were down two men when they were short two men right

[00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:37.840]
It seemed to me that watching them try to fight off those two penalties is almost as exciting as scoring a goal right. Oh, yeah, that was phenomenal

[00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:39.620]
Yeah, yeah, oh

[00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:41.900]
I'll tell you the rest of that defense phala and

[00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:44.980]
Carcler and jill van oski those guys got a butcher up big time

[00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:47.820]
Well, you know something I don't know if you've ever been out to Denver

[00:31:47.820 --> 00:31:52.000]
But you lose your breath real fast out there and I think they were just gassing towards the end there

[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:56.680]
Yeah, but Denver got back like at one thirty in the morning from Boston because they had to make up that game that was snowed out

[00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:59.040]
So they had like almost no sleep and

[00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:01.740]
You know if anybody should have run out of gas it was them

[00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:05.340]
But we got this new deal now where we had the same thing in that caps game here

[00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:07.460]
You get a four two lead in the third period you can't protect it

[00:32:07.460 --> 00:32:10.680]
We had a three nothing lead in that game. How can you blow a three nothing lead?

[00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:14.880]
What you're supposed to be a really solid defensive team which we're not now that's good

[00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:22.120]
How about that horrendous greasy gold a biserlet in that wrap around where the guy starts the other way and then a biser takes one big move in a wrong direction

[00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:26.860]
And by the time he gets back but I'm being it's in the net that was pretty weak john. Yeah pretty weak mr

[00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:32.420]
All-star. He's not get past them. Yeah, he always lets in one greasy goal man in this case it cost us the other point

[00:32:32.420 --> 00:32:37.320]
Hey, you you folks are very much involved with center one over there, right? Yes, we are um

[00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:43.500]
I thought it I bring something up in May. They're having a a road race for eight

[00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:46.640]
Are you familiar with that? No, I'm not it's a

[00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:51.520]
270 mile bike ride from Orlando to Miami. Mm-hmm, and

[00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:57.080]
It's another way for fundraising to take place in fact. There's a meeting tonight at center one well semi-all the stuff

[00:32:57.080 --> 00:33:00.940]
Okay, I'll factor to you. Okay. All right. Thanks a lot. All right, bubba. See ya

[00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:05.260]
Open line of Broward 5241 on the green line 1-800. Oh, it's speaking of center one

[00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:09.940]
Yesterday people were asking Phil to play the Larry King tape again and the various other stuff

[00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:16.860]
I'm driving home listening to this and one guy one guy from Venezuela another homophobic Julio

[00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:22.040]
He calls and is requesting some damn thing that he plays and he says well what the charity is this?

[00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:24.740]
So what it and Phil says center one is well what did they do?

[00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:30.880]
He says they help people with aids. Oh, uh instead of $60 now making $40 like these guys first of all where they wouldn't send

[00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:32.260]
60 cents in their first place

[00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:35.060]
But then when he found out what it was for and he's gonna reduce his

[00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:38.440]
Contribution because he heard it was for people with aids

[00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:41.260]
Spick yeah homophobic Julio's man

[00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:46.980]
I got news for if I had a dollar for every fag and buy a Julio that we got in this town

[00:33:46.980 --> 00:33:50.440]
I could retire right now guarantee you that that that's the damn truth

[00:33:51.660 --> 00:33:54.320]
All these closet people and this guy was from Venezuela

[00:33:56.500 --> 00:34:00.660]
All those guys in Venezuela do it. I'll tell you that right now and in Brazil man

[00:34:00.660 --> 00:34:03.760]
Even the women are man in Brazil. I've told you that many many times

[00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:06.380]
That's why I don't want to go there. You don't even know what you're dealing with

[00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:10.320]
1049 a WIOD the

[00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:16.020]
People in South Florida were pushing new buttons this week the ones controlling their heater

[00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:24.020]
Mother Nature caused it the weather channel predicted it and you got the news on the big chill from news talking entertainment radio

[00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:26.480]
610 WIOD

[00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:29.340]
The dolphins are gonna kick their ass

[00:34:29.340 --> 00:34:29.920]
Oh

[00:34:30.660 --> 00:34:37.680]
There comes a time in a young woman's life when she has to ask questions mom. I have to ask you a personal question

[00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:43.200]
Do you do sure I do I use vinegar and water why vinegar and water

[00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:51.540]
Because silly I'm Italian hidden valley douche in Italian French French or new chunky blue cheese

[00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:57.120]
1052 a WIOD we got an open line of date one and brown one on the green line three like I said

[00:34:57.120 --> 00:35:01.660]
They should all be smoking off the hook. You're just not enthusiastic. You're a bunch of deadheads man

[00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:04.840]
You should be parting right now. You should be rolling out the weed

[00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:08.680]
You should be getting out the goddamn buds in the bud lights. You should be getting out the moulson

[00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:11.360]
You should be having a party in your pantaloonies right now

[00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:17.760]
You should be grabbing whoever the hell is right next to you and just doing all kinds of wicked stuff like that guy from Venezuela is probably doing

[00:35:18.620 --> 00:35:19.880]
That homophobic Julio

[00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:27.060]
So anyway moving right like see you can't you know you try. Why do I do this you try to make gold out of chop to liver out of a chicken

[00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:28.180]
crap you can't do it

[00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:33.560]
When there's something they beg and they plead you finally give them what they want you say okay

[00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:35.880]
We're sick and tired of this we can't handle it anymore

[00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:40.660]
We don't want to support it and then maybe you start wondering if that might not have just been an excuse all along okay

[00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:43.500]
Oh here she is oh

[00:35:44.420 --> 00:35:45.680]

Because they're not gonna get any attention. Yeah, they'll be starting playing ball better

[00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:33.940]

Pardon me. I said what's your story? Why do you sound so incoherent and why do you keep pulling back?

[00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:01.300]

[00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:05.460]

[00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:06.380]
Okay, and we're paying tax money to support people like that. She's probably got 17 kids crawling around in the trailer

[00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:09.280]
Here's Hollywood. Hello

[00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:14.100]

[00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:19.040]
Meaning what? Well, wasn't he supposed to have some kind of press conferences this morning or no?

[00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:22.640]
He didn't have any press conference. He was on Y100 making an announcement about the

[00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:24.100]
Marrida and Marino uh

[00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:28.380]
charitable foundation for whatever that is and it had nothing to do with whether we there you go

[00:38:28.380 --> 00:38:32.260]
There's another guy that blurt's out the S-word you can't say crap on the air pal

[00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:37.240]
Maybe you can take one in this town. No, probably not

[00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:39.700]
But you can't say it

[00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:46.720]
We have an open line in date seven five one w come on. Let's get with it for crying out loud

[00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:50.620]
See there's another negative. Oh, isn't Dan gonna retire

[00:38:50.620 --> 00:38:55.880]
I just turned that there was a big announcement this morning on a radio right another guy that gets sucked in by David Ross

[00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:57.260]
And those figures and Y100

[00:38:58.020 --> 00:39:02.960]
When are you people ever gonna get a life because you're something on a radio right away? You believe it right?

[00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:07.360]
But the the um yeah the rain in Spain falls mainly on Uranus

[00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:08.480]
Right no

[00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:10.700]
Jesus god almighty

[00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:15.120]
Two open lines on the green lines. They don't care about Jimmy Johnson up there in Palm Beach

[00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:19.920]
They drive all the way down here to support the dolphins no matter who the coach is because they got nothing else anyway

[00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:25.420]
Except that purple palace and lot of stupid wrestling and a little of dinky minor league hockey team. That's all they got

[00:39:25.420 --> 00:39:28.360]
1-800-944-W-I-O-D

[00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:34.880]
Here's wet. What is that west bokeh? What is that? Hey now. Is there a west bokeh? Yeah, it's west

[00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:38.540]
And all right well excuse me and it's in between uh-huh

[00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:43.520]
Hey, I called you Tuesday and you called me an Irish pipe twister. Yeah, what's that supposed to mean?

[00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:49.360]
Just whatever it means like a Scottish bagpipe squeezeer. I'm Italian. Yeah, so what difference is it mate?

[00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:52.640]
And I do choose vinegar probably not even circumcised

[00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:57.100]
No, huh. How do you like that? Were you born in this country?

[00:39:57.960 --> 00:40:00.960]
Miami and you're not circumcised no and you're a tagging

[00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:03.380]
The Pope's pissed off about that. I'll tell you

[00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:08.860]
What why not? I don't know. What are your parents barbarians or something? They had mercy on you

[00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:10.120]
You're ass

[00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:14.780]
George just started a whole bunch of cheese in here and I know where it came from

[00:40:14.780 --> 00:40:18.120]
Listen to the movie. Yeah, right

[00:40:19.220 --> 00:40:24.400]
Speak all right. All right. What all right? So what's the purpose of the call? I have to get in the org man

[00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:30.580]
But what do you call for? I wanted to know why you called me that though. Oh what I was piped with this

[00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:35.300]
We have an open line on a purple line pound IOD. Here's the four-letterdale. Hello

[00:40:35.980 --> 00:40:41.960]
If the pipe fits where it four-letterdale's gone open line and powered five two four. Here's the Hollywood. Hello

[00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:46.120]
Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. I'm ready man. You're ready for what the dolphins? Uh-huh

[00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:53.200]
I think what one of the things that John's gonna do is he's gonna demand a crap loader respect from the players which

[00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:54.900]
Shoes it didn't have right

[00:40:54.900 --> 00:41:00.820]
He's got that first team me. He's gonna show you what leadership is all about just like Doug McClain did with our panthers

[00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:04.720]
He's gonna show you what being an active involved coach really means that

[00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:10.300]
And he's not gonna put up with the gene actins and Brian Cox and Louis Oliver's of the world for two seconds

[00:41:10.300 --> 00:41:14.820]
They better get it in their head right now if they plan on perpetuating that bull crap routine of theirs

[00:41:14.820 --> 00:41:21.900]
They can do it someplace else exactly not that I want to speak for Jimmy, but I do that first team meeting that he have that was beautiful

[00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:29.560]
Open line at Broward five two four nine four six three five two four w i o d and two on a green lines palm beach

[00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:34.240]
Try to get them enthused about anything except the goddamn cemetery village bingo is impossible

[00:41:35.100 --> 00:41:40.400]
1 800 nine four four nine four six three palm beaches the problem I've discovered that

[00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:42.920]
And as of like about noon today

[00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:47.740]
We're gonna transfer those two green lines those free palm beach lines over. She don't need those anyway

[00:41:47.740 --> 00:41:51.640]
She don't get no calls from because she's on an Orlando. She doesn't get the calls on those lines

[00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:52.820]
Who the hell needs those?

[00:41:53.140 --> 00:41:58.020]
Trans from over to purple lines and let's get these mobile people involved the active living and breathing people

[00:41:58.020 --> 00:42:01.360]
You may even get out of the house once in a great while like maybe once a month

[00:42:02.020 --> 00:42:06.100]
Is that a radio in your pocket? Are you just glad to see no

[00:42:06.100 --> 00:42:10.640]
We I O D my any fort-letter days use talking entertainment radio

[00:42:11.460 --> 00:42:14.440]
610 W I O D

[00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:17.220]
The worst talk radio I've ever heard in my life is on W out

[00:42:18.020 --> 00:42:18.020]

[00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:19.920]
Yes

[00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:20.220]
Yes

[00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:33.220]
I'm tombo dead for motel sex school is back in session and football seasons just around the corner and that means all you quarterbacks and cheerleaders will be looking to get laid

[00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:37.600]
Now it used to be you could have sex in the back seat of your father's car

[00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:44.820]
But with the size of those sub compacts they're making these days. There's hardly enough room to lose your chinos much less your cherry

[00:42:44.820 --> 00:42:52.160]
That's where motel sex comes in you can get a clean comfortable room with a bed in a nice bucket to keep your mad dog

[00:42:52.160 --> 00:43:00.540]
2020 nice and cold all for just $24 in most places a little more if you want a condom a little less if you don't plan on going all the way

[00:43:00.540 --> 00:43:02.160]
And we don't have to change the sheets

[00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:08.480]
So this way you can screw around all you want and you won't have to worry about taking a gear shift up the bike

[00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:12.580]
Oh, I'm tombo dead for motel sex and we'll leave the light on for you

[00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:37.520]
So you like it that way

[00:43:42.580 --> 00:43:49.060]
Not these not these everywhere Jesus Christ. He just passed right by me on your miles an hour if Jesus were coming back on a motorcycle

[00:43:49.060 --> 00:43:53.940]
They'd probably stop him for going too fast. I love these guys. Isn't that pathetic? I promote a

[00:43:53.940 --> 00:43:57.900]
An adult club in town. Yeah, and they won't let us advertise on the station

[00:43:57.900 --> 00:44:01.060]
So I don't know if I can mention the name on what station on your station why not

[00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:05.440]
Because the nature of our business not even the sex bitch show at night. Especially that one

[00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:09.860]
Why not let us touch that no wonder we can't have any spots on that show because it's a sex show

[00:44:09.860 --> 00:44:14.520]
But we can't have any sexual places on it. I'm a isn't that pathetic. What about your brown noses?

[00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:18.960]
We got down her in salesman. Although I think that's her call. She's the one that said now. I don't want none of that

[00:44:19.500 --> 00:44:24.600]
Yes, go ahead. What can I mention the name you can mention whatever you want all right to see his cabaret. Oh, you can't say that

[00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:27.920]
I just did what tootsies cabaret. I didn't say that. Oh

[00:44:28.740 --> 00:44:34.460]
Well, what is it? What do you do there? Well, it's a nude lady, you know nude ladies. Yeah, you know everything you need is right there

[00:44:34.460 --> 00:44:39.220]
So what's wrong with that? It's a beautiful thing. We want to invite Jimmy Johnson to come see Christy Canyon this week

[00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:45.840]
Christie's Canyon Christy's the Valley of the Canyon. Yeah, that amazing thing. Uh-huh 600 films

[00:44:46.940 --> 00:44:53.280]
Yeah, she's a star. Yeah, I bet I'll bet kind of a worn-out star at this point, but nevertheless a big star

[00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:57.240]
Real good. Okay, but you got to get it to me. Oh, okay

[00:44:57.240 --> 00:45:01.500]
Because Jimmy singles an easy to single guy. That's right now. I was married. We couldn't get him in there right

[00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:04.600]
He's always moaning because he's married to Mary and whatever she was you want to go in there

[00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:08.720]
But but we can get Jimmy in there Jimmy will be glad to come by when he says that

[00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:13.920]
Don's married to Dorothy is what Larry said is that what's going on now? That's what he said no. Yes, he did

[00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:18.820]
Well, listen pack. Good luck to you. Okay. I gotta go keep doing whatever you're doing. Yeah, right? Okay

[00:45:19.700 --> 00:45:24.540]
We have an open line on a green line 1-800-944 go up to Tutsi's and get whatever you want to get

[00:45:24.540 --> 00:45:26.620]
Okay, get some Tutsi's get laid get some something

Well, by the way, don't forget the young and a horny day. I think next getting out today. He's gonna shave

[00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:37.540]
Here's Hollywood. Hello. Yeah, Neil. Yes, sir. I tried to get through yesterday, but your lines were jammed

[00:45:37.540 --> 00:45:42.020]
In reference to that guy that was talking about a Jewish porn star

[00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:48.880]
Jerry Butler is Jewish. Yeah, I grew up with I don't want to know from him. He makes me sick to my stomach

[00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:56.680]
I'm just verifying that the guy is telling the truth, but I don't know where he came up with the name Berkowitz's last name is

[00:45:56.680 --> 00:46:03.380]
Ciderman I grew up with Rick Ciderman is a porn star. Paul Ciderman is his ring. Oh my god Rick son

[00:46:03.380 --> 00:46:07.160]
I wonder he sounds so deep pressed all the time and speaks with that list. I don't know

[00:46:07.160 --> 00:46:13.060]
But I just called to verify that gentleman's story. He is Jewish. I once said Jerry Butler in a movie to a very strange thing

[00:46:13.060 --> 00:46:19.200]
And thanks giving time with a turkey, but I don't want to win it whatever he said to he didn't I just called to

[00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:24.260]
The gentleman is telling the truth. Okay, well, I always thought he was pretty circumspect well

[00:46:24.260 --> 00:46:29.800]
He was always a strange character. Okay. All right. Thanks for the good news. Okay more Jewish hockey players too

[00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:32.980]
We need besides Matthew Schneider and Mike Hartman and who is the other one? I don't know

[00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:38.240]
Open line at day seven you know you what's wrong with you people come on. We're having a party here today

[00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:45.120]
As Mike Spindell once said on a station when he was on a year with nobody listening don't you people want to have a good time?

[00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:52.840]
Oh those were the days my friend those were the days when we had little pipsquicks on here

[00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:57.480]
You're a good guy Mike, but you belong down here about as much as most of our weekend programming is not at all

[00:46:59.300 --> 00:47:01.800]
Unbelievable don't you people want to have a good time

[00:47:02.660 --> 00:47:06.200]
Yes, what Mike that you're not our idea of a good time are you no

[00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:12.420]
Here's not on the ear and not off the ear you're a good guy, but just keep inspecting those restaurants. Here's Boka. Hello

[00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:14.120]
Hello

[00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:19.180]
Hello, yes sir Neil. Yes, I am. Hey, this is Bob from excitement. How are you?

[00:47:19.780 --> 00:47:24.900]
What is this like a setup job now? We just had one up pervert on a year now. We got another one now come on

[00:47:24.900 --> 00:47:26.300]
I'm not a pervert. Yeah, it's a setup

[00:47:26.300 --> 00:47:31.580]
No, you know what I just got these clippings from the newspapers as the high court up holes the band

[00:47:31.580 --> 00:47:36.960]
On racy shows during the day. Yeah, did you hear about that? It's the way it's not a racy shows

[00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:41.080]
It's just there's nothing new. It's the same thing that they came out with nine years ago

[00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:43.960]
Well, who decides if it's racy or not? That's what I'd like to know

[00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:48.100]
Only the Republicans figure that out. Okay, unbelievable

[00:47:48.940 --> 00:47:55.020]
The word police figure that out maybe if you say penis on the air that's uh, no, it's not racing

[00:47:55.020 --> 00:47:57.820]
That's not racing. All depends if it's circumcised or not. No

[00:47:58.660 --> 00:48:01.160]
So so what are we gonna have inspections now? Yes

[00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:06.400]
And you know what else? They're still trying to do away with adult entertainment down in date county

[00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:12.320]
So can I tell you something you guys think that you're gonna use me yeah, you're really crack me up. Okay

[00:48:12.320 --> 00:48:16.320]
You know, yes you do you think you're gonna use me to fight city hall here the people don't care

[00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:22.480]
Don't you understand the people don't care and the people who frequent those establishments are gonna be the last ones to speak out

[00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:26.780]
Because they don't want their name associated like in public that anybody would go into one of those places

[00:48:26.780 --> 00:48:28.320]
Even though everybody does okay

[00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:33.580]
Well, we're in the bottom line. We hope that we catch them on a good day and they'll realize that they're right to be in somewhere

[00:48:33.580 --> 00:48:37.920]
They don't they don't they're just a bunch of cowards. Okay, that's right

[00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:43.300]
Well, that's why they let a bunch of right-wing Julio's dictate what's going on here in date county and all over South Florida

[00:48:43.300 --> 00:48:47.340]
And that's why it's so backward and that's why if you haven't noticed lately, we don't got no tourists here

[00:48:47.340 --> 00:48:54.560]
Yeah, and you know when they'll miss it. Yeah, well, so so what do you want me to do? I'm gonna be them over the head

[00:48:54.560 --> 00:48:56.700]
Yes, you're not no, I'm not

[00:48:56.700 --> 00:49:00.240]
See you're trying to use me forget it get out of here. Go away

[00:49:01.260 --> 00:49:07.000]
We're having a party here today for Jimmy Johnson and everybody's got their clothes on and now we get two calls and roll two setup deals here

[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:13.220]
They're trying to muscle in on the show call the sex bitch there at night. That's her job. Although of course you wouldn't be caught dead in the place like that

[00:49:14.140 --> 00:49:15.760]
The uptight sex bitch

[00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:18.760]
Even Stevie Wonder was never so uptight

[00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:22.540]
Two open lines on the green lines where the calls from there today

[00:49:22.540 --> 00:49:26.600]
I wouldn't wish on Heinrich Kimler. That's how bad. I wouldn't wish him on lardass limbaugh

[00:49:27.540 --> 00:49:33.820]
1-800-944 you folks are weak. We're having a party in Dayton, Broward and you people are a bunch of party poopers, okay

[00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:37.300]
Talking about a lot of Drek. Let's get with it here

[00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:41.460]
Jimmy's gonna sign this afternoon. It's official. We got a real football coach

[00:49:41.460 --> 00:49:46.720]
We got some dolphin fans including me including Rick Riley including probably a lot of you who aren't even calling and tell us about it

[00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:47.840]
coming back into the fold

[00:49:48.600 --> 00:49:55.840]
So we can go out there with little real enthusiasm instead of faking it and even those sex guys that just called they know there's nothing worse than faking it

[00:49:56.800 --> 00:49:59.560]
It's 1113 at WIOD

[00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:06.260]
Any better than Neil Rogers that is great radio

[00:50:28.460 --> 00:50:29.380]
All right

[00:50:29.380 --> 00:50:33.640]
Budweiser be you're so crappy it makes even algae covered frogs sick

[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:41.180]
1116 at WIOD I'm waiting on those green lines. I'm still waiting for a little enthusiasm from Palm Beach

[00:50:41.180 --> 00:50:44.120]
And they don't know about these things we got to give away here either

[00:50:44.740 --> 00:50:46.300]
1-800-944

[00:50:47.560 --> 00:50:51.560]
They are the worst you know I keep talking myself out of that because you know you're desperate

[00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:54.240]
But not for them you guys suck

[00:50:54.820 --> 00:50:56.180]
Here's Miami Beach hello

[00:50:56.700 --> 00:51:01.260]
Hey good morning, Neil for a matter of fact from now I'm starting this season all sporting events in Dayton, Brad

[00:51:01.260 --> 00:51:03.920]
We're gonna be checking drivers licenses if you have a Palm Beach address

[00:51:03.920 --> 00:51:06.460]
We're gonna make it turn around and go back where you came from right

[00:51:07.760 --> 00:51:08.640]
Anyway, yes sir

[00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:15.820]
Miami Beach yes, okay first time caller here. Okay. Excuse me for like catching off guard there, but I have to say that

[00:51:15.820 --> 00:51:21.900]
Okay, I like your ads for the most part fastards up there. Yeah, well fifth fifth generation Miami in

[00:51:21.900 --> 00:51:26.640]
Yes, I'm not the Julio off and I'm hi alia, but I did grow up there, man. Yeah

[00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:32.960]
I just wanted to let you know I am a closet dolphin football fan. I don't show my emotion

[00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:36.260]
Outwardly for the team, but I do why not them

[00:51:36.740 --> 00:51:44.140]
Probably you were pretty embarrassed up until now. Yeah, pretty much so I do go to games every now and then I'm not a season ticket holder

[00:51:44.780 --> 00:51:48.820]
But one thing I do would like to comment on the state county crowd

[00:51:49.400 --> 00:51:58.360]
You've got all these Julios here that think it's more important to go to the three Kings parade when the dolphins are in some type of

[00:51:58.360 --> 00:52:00.520]
Conference playoff at the orange ball

[00:52:01.060 --> 00:52:04.520]
This is this was years ago. Yeah, and that was one of the games I went to

[00:52:04.520 --> 00:52:05.280]
Uh

[00:52:06.320 --> 00:52:13.960]
Stands were empty really so this I can't remember what game that oh my god, but all the Julios they have you expect the dog

[00:52:13.960 --> 00:52:17.080]
Complete with the three Kings parade. What are you?

[00:52:17.260 --> 00:52:17.680]
Munchracy?

[00:52:18.440 --> 00:52:20.640]
Yeah, that's what that was the big thing back then

[00:52:20.640 --> 00:52:26.040]
They had to go to the three Kings parade and you one had a chicken to slaughter to the god jungle afterwards

[00:52:26.460 --> 00:52:31.380]
So I they that that was more important and going to the dolphins playoff

[00:52:31.960 --> 00:52:32.380]
but

[00:52:33.080 --> 00:52:37.580]
I just wanted to let you know I am a closet dolphin fan and what are you giving away?

[00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:42.900]
Yeah, yeah, many more of those really cute movies from yesterday that I did

[00:52:42.900 --> 00:52:43.980]
We're giving away this

[00:52:45.340 --> 00:52:46.960]
Good luck to pal. Not here

[00:52:47.660 --> 00:52:51.620]
He's in the closet. You can be sure that opalion and date seven five one

[00:52:51.620 --> 00:52:55.940]
Yeah, bring your own chicken all you Julios when it come to the dolphin games this year bring your own chicken

[00:52:55.940 --> 00:53:01.300]
You know how we throw the rubber rats at the Panther games when a Panther score a goal when the dolphins a score a touchdown

[00:53:01.300 --> 00:53:04.200]
This year, which we hope will be a lot you're gonna throw a rubber chicken

[00:53:05.440 --> 00:53:07.940]
And if you come from Haleo probably throw a live chicken

[00:53:08.520 --> 00:53:10.460]
But sliced ahead first, you know what I'm saying

[00:53:11.420 --> 00:53:18.260]
Here's the lady in deer field beach hello. Hello. Yes. Hi Neil. Long time listener first caller great. How are you?

[00:53:18.420 --> 00:53:23.120]
I'm great. I have been sensational. I had to call and say that I definitely think you may

[00:53:23.120 --> 00:53:25.340]
Johnson's the greatest thing that could happen to the dolphin. Oh

[00:53:25.860 --> 00:53:30.980]
Finally, we got some enthusiasm leave it to a woman to be enthusiastic all these guys sound brain dead out there

[00:53:30.980 --> 00:53:36.540]
They should be having a party. They're not real football fans. I don't know what their story is they're much of sour pushes

[00:53:37.420 --> 00:53:41.340]
On me. I also wanted to ask you a favor. Can you play that song?

[00:53:42.420 --> 00:53:45.260]
Because I really can't tell that song well the dolphin song

[00:53:45.260 --> 00:53:49.100]
What song the song about the dolphins the real one?

[00:53:49.580 --> 00:53:53.540]
Yeah, well the one you played it once yesterday the

[00:53:54.440 --> 00:53:58.640]
Only reason I'm saying this as I really I don't know what song you're talking about

[00:53:59.880 --> 00:54:05.960]
Well, the reason I hope that Jimmy Johnson can make a difference if nothing else. I hope he cleans up Brian's mouth

[00:54:05.960 --> 00:54:06.720]
Yeah

[00:54:15.280 --> 00:54:16.280]
I'm not

[00:54:17.960 --> 00:54:27.720]
And it's tasteful the dolphins are cursing and man it's distracible cuz Brian Cox and the rest of them are saying

[00:54:28.680 --> 00:54:29.120]
Take my

[00:54:31.720 --> 00:54:43.380]
Words of love they toss in the microphone the dump button just can't seem to be left alone and all of this is because they like saying

[00:54:48.460 --> 00:54:52.380]
But they play football badly

[00:54:59.120 --> 00:54:59.980]
I don't say that

[00:55:03.020 --> 00:55:03.240]
Well

[00:55:05.340 --> 00:55:08.140]
Well, they make it to the Super Bowl

[00:55:10.140 --> 00:55:13.600]
But with an attitude as bad as there

[00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:17.640]
Tossing our hopes down the stair

[00:55:19.700 --> 00:55:20.660]
Oh

[00:55:20.660 --> 00:55:29.880]
The dolphins are cursing and man it's distracible cuz Brian Cox and the rest of them are saying

[00:55:30.440 --> 00:55:30.600]
So

[00:55:32.160 --> 00:55:34.320]
Yes, they're saying

[00:55:36.740 --> 00:55:38.220]
They're saying

[00:55:38.220 --> 00:55:38.780]
Like my

[00:55:38.780 --> 00:55:47.360]
All right, did you uh

[00:55:51.180 --> 00:55:53.100]

Jewish porno

[00:57:13.880 --> 00:57:14.320]

Ron Jeremy yeah, he's born in Israel. Oh, we know that. Oh, I don't know anybody that here that Harry would have to be the Jewish or Greek

[00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:22.860]
Yeah, but

[00:57:24.920 --> 00:57:29.220]
ESC is and grotesque I'm going on my way to the yarn to the

[00:57:29.220 --> 00:57:34.020]
Gerard to get my tickets go Jeremy in fact there's

[00:57:34.020 --> 00:57:37.040]
around the inner circles of the porno world

[00:57:37.040 --> 00:57:39.900]
I always said that Harry reams in the Ron Jeremy blows

[00:57:40.660 --> 00:57:43.660]
True each other there you go. Yeah, have a nice life

[00:57:43.660 --> 00:57:47.500]
Okay, there's a guy who's on his way to San Jose right now to get his season tickets for next year

[00:57:47.500 --> 00:57:50.140]
That's the people I want to hear from come on. Let's come out wherever you are

[00:57:50.140 --> 00:57:55.400]
Are you that stupid that you're going to sit back and wait? Oh, well he kept this uh Gary Stevens or we did this

[00:57:55.400 --> 00:57:58.460]
Yeah, come on you're just waiting for an excuse. You're not fooling me

[00:57:59.180 --> 00:58:08.160]
All this alleged enthusiasm and I took all this abuse for last year and a half because I jumped off the bandwagon with great enthusiasm and for very very legitimate reasons by the way

[00:58:09.060 --> 00:58:13.600]
And now all of a sudden when you wait to see their tremendous enthusiasm where the hell is it? It doesn't exist

[00:58:14.320 --> 00:58:16.580]
They're dead of the Nagat damn doornail

[00:58:17.140 --> 00:58:20.160]
Open line and Broward five two four nine four six three

[00:58:21.040 --> 00:58:25.000]
Here the most enthusiastic person we had so far was that woman I called a couple of calls ago

[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:29.040]
She's the only one that's all excited about Jimmy and I think she's awaiting for him the show up in a vet

[00:58:29.900 --> 00:58:34.560]
Here's Miami. Hello. Hi, Neil. How you doing? Okay good. I can't get into football yet

[00:58:34.560 --> 00:58:38.920]
Because I think the brain stem has made me brain dead as far as the dolphins go and okay

[00:58:38.920 --> 00:58:43.460]
There we go nobody excited about this because we got all these months to wait now for for that's right

[00:58:43.460 --> 00:58:47.420]
We got to wait till August and okay. I got to wait till at least after the panthers and you win the cup

[00:58:47.420 --> 00:58:51.020]
Yeah, right. Let me ask you a question. Why are they sitting out the war I can do and share

[00:58:52.140 --> 00:58:58.020]
You have to ask Doug McLean that I mean do you see any reason for no, I don't I don't either especially last night was I kept hearing

[00:58:58.020 --> 00:59:03.500]
People crying. I don't want to mention my friend Rimmer and Denise there last night about how we have this tremendous shortage of forwards

[00:59:03.500 --> 00:59:07.680]
And in the meantime, we're playing Paul laws on forward who got a goal last night by the way

[00:59:08.760 --> 00:59:13.240]
But we keep hearing about how they have to keep doing these short shifts because we're sure on the forwards

[00:59:13.460 --> 00:59:20.700]
And in the meantime, well these guys are sitting on a bench and they're and they're pulling why are they pulling up these guys from the miners to take their place like why if it's not

[00:59:20.700 --> 00:59:24.620]
And how come Harkin said on a bench almost the entire game last night when they did yank him up

[00:59:24.620 --> 00:59:27.460]
I don't I don't get it and they put them in in the last couple minutes

[00:59:27.460 --> 00:59:29.920]
But I don't want to start second guessing Doug McLean

[00:59:29.920 --> 00:59:32.240]
I do a great job, and I'm not going to pull a knees

[00:59:32.240 --> 00:59:37.420]
I'm gonna start second guessing the coach because I'm so much smarter than everybody else like Denise's you know

[00:59:37.420 --> 00:59:42.620]
Denise is so smart. He would be managing or doing something somewhere instead of sitting there talking about

[00:59:42.620 --> 00:59:49.280]
Wooster Mass. Are they sure talks enough about it? Oh God, you know, I watched the I watched a great team the other day play the Rochester Nighthawks

[00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:53.400]
The what the world look cross league. Oh great

[00:59:53.400 --> 00:59:58.080]
And it's good. It's like hockey on the out of here. You didn't you never watch it? No, I have not

[00:59:58.080 --> 01:00:03.380]
For about two seconds on ESPN when they got to fill up some time. That's where I watched it. Oh get out of here

[01:00:03.380 --> 01:00:07.920]
I was Rochester and it was yeah, I was like hockey, you know, they score a lot. Yeah, whatever you say

[01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:11.220]
I'm by the way Corey Hurts. I don't know anybody in Rochester who scored a lot

[01:00:11.220 --> 01:00:16.860]
Corey Hurts is Jewish. Would you believe it? No. Yeah, is he sounds like it? Yeah, maybe he's kind of sunny

[01:00:16.860 --> 01:00:23.900]
Hersh. Maybe crazy legs. Elroy. Maybe he is kind of sunny. Am I D? All right. Okay pal. Thanks for good news. Corey

[01:00:23.900 --> 01:00:27.420]
Hurts another Jew. All right. We're gonna have it all Jewish hockey team. How do you like that?

[01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:34.740]
Huh? That's what we're gonna have. We have two open lines in date. Your enthusiasm is just contagious. That's why there isn't any

[01:00:35.300 --> 01:00:39.000]
Look at this. It's right back to the same old two open lines in date and one and brown

[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:45.780]
Jimmy Johnson will be announced at four there have an oppressed conferences afternoon. This is what all of you people wanted

[01:00:46.780 --> 01:00:51.980]
All of you people that brow beat me for a year and a half come on you gotta be a fan you gotta come back into the fold

[01:00:53.060 --> 01:00:57.260]
And here we are ready to rock and roll to buy season tickets to get all enthused and excited

[01:00:57.260 --> 01:00:59.920]
And it's the same same dead

[01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:08.560]
non-response that I'm used to for 20 goddamn years the first week that I came here on WKAT in March of 1976

[01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:14.240]
In some old 400-year-old fossil calls me. Ah, you'll never last a month in his town pal

[01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:18.940]
Well, here we are almost 20 years later and I'm still here and God only knows why

[01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:24.600]
God only knows why I'm still in this God forsaken place because the enthusiasm level if anything

[01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:28.480]
It's less than it was 20 years does anybody know why no I don't

[01:01:29.860 --> 01:01:33.720]
They get something they can be excited about something they can sink their teeth into like Jimmy's here

[01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:37.040]
Whatever it might be do they get excited no damn right. They don't

[01:01:37.060 --> 01:01:40.720]
It's about time he got something right you little a hunchback geek

[01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:45.080]
Here's Hollywood hello. Hey, how you doing?

[01:01:45.220 --> 01:01:51.120]
Okay, sir, hey, I'm fired up man. All right, let me tell you Jimmy Johnson is a defensive line coach

[01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:52.940]
Okay, that's what this since

[01:01:52.940 --> 01:01:56.700]
Stand where and they're powerful with a guy that had the most tax for the dolphins

[01:01:56.700 --> 01:02:00.740]
We haven't had anybody that knows defensive line play man. There you go

[01:02:00.740 --> 01:02:04.820]
And this guy put together Jim Jeff coat he put together um

[01:02:04.820 --> 01:02:10.300]
Charles Haley. I mean that defensive line for Dallas. He put that together and that's what he's bringing here

[01:02:10.300 --> 01:02:15.320]
Yeah, and that's that's the greatest thing of the whole thing man is that we're gonna have a defense all right

[01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:17.280]
We haven't defense in years here

[01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:21.460]
Tom Oliver Donne can pack himself a salami sandwich and get out of here because he's history

[01:02:21.460 --> 01:02:25.160]
Tom out of a job. He's what he is right. Hey man, you know what?

[01:02:25.540 --> 01:02:30.640]
He's right that crap's got to go is what he said all we didn't say crap something that kind of sounds like crap

[01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:36.280]
But hey the word police get very upset when you say crap on the air so I don't say it again pal

[01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:39.240]
But you're right on target. We finally took me an hour and a half to get one guy

[01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:44.440]
We got one woman and one guy and an hour and a half that are really fired up and enthusiastic because Jimmy Johnson's coming

[01:02:46.060 --> 01:02:50.060]
See they don't know what they want they talk a lot these people they take all these pulls

[01:02:50.060 --> 01:02:55.280]
Oh, yeah, we all want this and they've been hockin a china just to fill up time on a sports shows for the last six months

[01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:56.420]
That's all it's been

[01:02:57.140 --> 01:03:02.680]
But as far as real emotion real passion how long have I been telling you this is a city without passion

[01:03:03.220 --> 01:03:07.240]
Like Gene Pintney would say the town without pity the town that is a pity

[01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:12.620]
And I come in here all fired up this morning. I'm watching a press conference his last night

[01:03:12.620 --> 01:03:17.500]
My leafs kick ass against the kings come from behind three times. They kick some serious ass

[01:03:17.500 --> 01:03:22.400]
Here's Andrew Chuck at the point. Hey shoots and scores and Leafs win the game five to four

[01:03:23.220 --> 01:03:26.340]
And Matt sendine sticks in a beautiful a lovely little

[01:03:26.340 --> 01:03:30.820]
Goldair as Harry Neal would say and the Panthers even though they did blow the lead

[01:03:30.820 --> 01:03:33.920]
They still get a point on the road which ain't too bad against the top team Colorado

[01:03:35.780 --> 01:03:40.800]
But these people don't give a crap because we got a drunken lady up there in Palm Beach who's worried about H.R.S. and

[01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:41.680]
SDS

[01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:43.360]
FDS

[01:03:43.900 --> 01:03:45.180]
Here's Kendall hello

[01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:48.100]
Why is IOD only five thousand watch?

[01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:50.520]
Why are you using that 40 voice?

[01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:52.420]
Put his rod scene job from 97

[01:03:52.420 --> 01:03:55.300]
Okay, that's good. Okay. Well blow it out your ash, Ron

[01:03:56.180 --> 01:04:00.720]
We have an open line at day 7519463 751

[01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:06.640]
W IOD I don't think we're only five thousand watts. Are we 10,000 watts during the daytime? I think that's what I thought

[01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:10.800]
I think we're 10,000 watts. Are we no oh not since he left

[01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:17.260]
Here's the lady in bokeh. Hello. Yes, hi Neil. How are you today? I'm doing great. Are you firing up about anything?

[01:04:17.260 --> 01:04:19.600]
Are you enthusiastic? I am more than enthusiastic

[01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:26.100]
I'm looking on clouds. In fact, I went to my doctor from my yearly physical today

[01:04:26.100 --> 01:04:31.880]
Yeah, and he's a big dolphin fan. He's excited. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. I went to public excuse me public afterwards

[01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:34.860]
That's all anybody was talking about is thank God

[01:04:34.860 --> 01:04:38.860]
Not on this show not on this show. I bring it up first thing right out of the box this morning

[01:04:38.860 --> 01:04:41.400]
Let's have a party. Let's celebrate. Let's hear all your enthusiasm

[01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:47.540]
Let's hear from all the really hopeful excited people and it's the same tired D and see they always blame that on me

[01:04:47.540 --> 01:04:51.140]
I'm supposed to be the guy that's so negative. I'm depressing. Uh, you know

[01:04:51.140 --> 01:04:54.620]
I look I'm desperate to find something to be positive about here when you find it

[01:04:54.620 --> 01:04:56.440]
They don't give a flying crap this audience

[01:04:56.440 --> 01:05:01.300]
But these are probably the people who did it home and criticize the dolphins that don't buy the tickets

[01:05:01.300 --> 01:05:03.280]
Marley had good reason the last two years

[01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:07.180]
Yeah, but now they got no reason that see that's the problem. They have no more excuses left

[01:05:07.180 --> 01:05:09.600]
They're probably spending their time now looking for a new excuse

[01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:14.840]
Well, I just hope that the people that are going out because I've been a season ticket holder for seven years

[01:05:14.840 --> 01:05:20.580]
And I've spoken to you before and I just hope the people that are buying them today or in the near future

[01:05:21.240 --> 01:05:25.900]
Because if they don't get to the Super Bowl next year all the sudden it's gonna be oh yeah, you know

[01:05:25.900 --> 01:05:27.820]
You know there's that there's that element. They're gonna

[01:05:27.820 --> 01:05:30.360]
Expect it overnight 17 and all again and all that crap

[01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:32.680]
But those people are more runs and they know nothing about the game

[01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:39.680]
And believe me the people that have had the season tickets around has been there as long as we have and they all for the last two years

[01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:40.600]
Have been saying

[01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:47.200]
Shula's got to go and J.J.'s got to be in right, you know, so where the hell are they now? Where are they probably out partying?

[01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:51.540]
I know that the make-believe sports station. They're talking about the heat. They're talking about Joe Rose's teeth

[01:05:51.540 --> 01:05:57.020]
They're talking about everything but what the hell is wrong with these people? I don't know for crying out loud

[01:05:57.020 --> 01:05:59.240]
I know and one other thing I want to talk to you about

[01:05:59.820 --> 01:06:03.800]
We're both guiding light fans. Yes, and I was I'm really disappointed

[01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:07.440]
Oh, at this critical critical stage of the story

[01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:13.140]
We got a different a make-believe actor in here. Exactly. What is it deal with that? That's why they're going off the ear that show because the

[01:06:13.140 --> 01:06:14.640]
the producers and the

[01:06:15.340 --> 01:06:18.180]
Whoever the hell of people are putting that show together a bunch of morons

[01:06:18.180 --> 01:06:25.360]
I mean the this guy's been on for they've been carrying this story for a year right and now all the sudden last week when it's the most critical

[01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:30.360]
They get this other actor who doesn't even compare to the other no not at all

[01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:34.920]
And they gave no explanation. They just said, you know, this part is now being today is being played

[01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:38.580]
Maybe he's sick. I mean, I don't know of course, but it's very important

[01:06:38.580 --> 01:06:40.900]
They couldn't postpone it after you wait for 52 weeks

[01:06:40.900 --> 01:06:45.800]
We couldn't await another week or two tell us got over his flu or whatever his story is exactly what tell us wrong with them

[01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:52.040]
I don't know my god very disappointed with that. Oh tragic and they even went a bad face mask now

[01:06:52.040 --> 01:06:56.480]
Doesn't even look the same because he's got a new he's got a schnauz it's like six times the size of the other guy

[01:06:56.480 --> 01:07:00.840]
I know. Oh my god and poor Lucy she's running around up there in circles on at

[01:07:02.020 --> 01:07:07.880]
Watchtower. I mean the at the at the other Brent as a woman was ugly, but this guy he would have never even passed as a woman

[01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:14.080]
Like the other one did well saying he was very ugly, but at least if it's 52 weeks in a row

[01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:18.100]
I'm sitting there screaming at my TV this Mary and can't you people don't you have two eyes?

[01:07:18.100 --> 01:07:21.560]
Can't you see that's not a woman? I know can't you smell it?

[01:07:21.700 --> 01:07:22.580]
I know my god

[01:07:23.240 --> 01:07:27.100]
And they built us up to this gigantic climax and now we got a ringer in there

[01:07:27.100 --> 01:07:30.600]
I know he's awful and they couldn't even a Christmas time bring back Mike Bauer

[01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:35.220]
What the hell is wrong with these people? Yeah, I never however year they used to bring back some of the old people at Christmas time

[01:07:35.220 --> 01:07:38.420]
Not this year what they did was show us a few cheap cheesy

[01:07:38.840 --> 01:07:44.800]
You know flashbacks with pop a bow or in build drunken build bow or in bird hopping around around around at one leg

[01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:50.080]
I mean what the hell was that in fact? I just went into paper and I didn't realize that Henry passed away

[01:07:50.960 --> 01:07:56.820]
Henry Chamberlain. Yeah. Oh, no. Yeah, Henry. They're gonna write it into the storyline. He died. Yeah

[01:07:57.440 --> 01:08:00.180]
I hate to tell you where I read it. It's one of those tabloids

[01:08:00.180 --> 01:08:05.460]
I could read that he's a little hairy Chamberlain died next. It'll be old hb Lewis. Yeah, that's right. Oh

[01:08:05.460 --> 01:08:10.080]
Yeah, he's been around a long time. Well, get it on I say get that show off all it's still we still have some good memories

[01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:15.240]
Yeah, well they did have a good storyline, but my opinion they blew it when they got this other actor in absolutely

[01:08:15.240 --> 01:08:18.260]
Correct. They'd be and I mean they have her jewelry with

[01:08:18.260 --> 01:08:22.260]
Everything a long time for them to figure out who that is isn't it?

[01:08:22.280 --> 01:08:26.360]
She's probably just lying on a table somewhere riding away until they figure out who that is

[01:08:26.360 --> 01:08:26.900]
I know

[01:08:26.900 --> 01:08:31.120]
I'll tell you if I wanted to really sharp detective on some case

[01:08:31.700 --> 01:08:34.940]
Frankie's the guy had have right on top of it. Oh, well of course. What a long kid

[01:08:34.940 --> 01:08:40.000]
Yeah, and soap operas you become a doctor overnight you become the best police officer overnight

[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:44.940]
You know that's the world of soap operas once they kick Philip and Beth off the show that was the end of it

[01:08:44.940 --> 01:08:49.100]
Yeah, absolutely okay, I'm not that crazy about the new hour of Xandry either

[01:08:49.100 --> 01:08:52.720]
Bring back the old one. She was a real shrier. She was a hell razor

[01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:57.160]
So now I just I have to change something instead of it being Neil God

[01:08:57.160 --> 01:09:02.500]

Here's coral gables purple line hello. Hello. Yes, sir. Uh, yeah

[01:13:11.340 --> 01:13:16.520]
I want to make a comment about the Jimmy Johnson thing here finally. Oh, yes. Let me tell you something

[01:13:16.520 --> 01:13:21.280]
I haven't been able to enjoy a beer for the last year because of the because of the shula you know every time I can

[01:13:21.280 --> 01:13:26.340]
Everybody's been crying in their beer. Oh man. It's getting too salty every time it's like you know

[01:13:26.340 --> 01:13:29.880]
I start watching I drink two or three beers. I can't finish my food. You know

[01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:34.640]
Maybe I can enjoy the damn game. I'm originally from Boston. I am a hockey fan. All right

[01:13:34.640 --> 01:13:40.920]
And you know, I came down here saying oh damn, you know, I can't be a patriot. At least I can be a dolphin fan. What a disappointment man

[01:13:40.920 --> 01:13:47.420]
You'll see Derek Sanderson behind that that stick it out in front the Bobby or there it is and air goes that crazy Dan Kelly again, you know

[01:13:48.100 --> 01:13:51.180]
The Bruins win a Stanley Cup, but that's a lifetime ago too, sir

[01:13:52.340 --> 01:13:58.300]
I'm gonna tell you Steve Casper's got to go if you're a Bruins fan Casper's got to go get rid of that guy's a twit

[01:13:58.300 --> 01:14:00.640]
Don Cherry says he's a twit

[01:14:01.220 --> 01:14:06.240]
And he's got the panties down here. I'm very enthusiastic about them. Yeah, it's easy to give up the Bruins right now

[01:14:06.240 --> 01:14:08.160]
They don't they don't make them leave though, you know, I mean

[01:14:08.600 --> 01:14:14.980]
Um, I got a good question. Um, does everybody actually know why shula doesn't like Jimmy Johnson? Uh, no

[01:14:14.980 --> 01:14:21.900]
up because uh, let me ask you this. Does the word jealousy come into play? Well that and you know his son did coach under Jimmy Johnson in Dallas

[01:14:21.900 --> 01:14:25.240]
Yeah, and um that was a little while ago

[01:14:25.240 --> 01:14:30.620]
Jimmy Johnson called shula to tell him that he was gonna get rid of his son and shula was very upset about it

[01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:34.220]
This is in the newspaper maybe a year and a half maybe two years ago. Mm-hmm

[01:14:34.220 --> 01:14:36.280]
Apparently it's down like what you saw we said, you know

[01:14:36.280 --> 01:14:39.980]
No one likes to hear the truth and apparently shula didn't want to hear it and of course as soon as

[01:14:39.980 --> 01:14:43.960]
Jimmy went to Fox after he and Jerry Jones had a big falling out in Dallas

[01:14:43.960 --> 01:14:50.120]
And even at that point the rumors started surfacing about Jimmy's coming and at that point shula became he reached the point

[01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:56.160]
Where he hated him because he saw Jimmy's ghost hovering over his ass every single moment of every day of his life

[01:14:56.160 --> 01:14:57.300]
Oh, yeah, I get you know

[01:14:57.860 --> 01:15:01.600]
Well, if I looked your show uh, um, first time caller great driver

[01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:06.980]
I listen to all the time thank God for Jimmy Johnson and thank God I can actually enjoy some damn good beer again

[01:15:06.980 --> 01:15:07.460]
All right

[01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:12.780]
See you there. Bye. Look for me right there on a 50 yard line with that big fat guy next to me up there

[01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:18.280]
We have an open line on the purple line, which is now the AT in T wireless and mobile one cellular line

[01:15:18.280 --> 01:15:23.140]
Which means anybody that's got a cell phone can call and we pay for it anybody and everybody no matter what you got

[01:15:23.140 --> 01:15:25.440]
How do you like that no matter how big it is

[01:15:26.060 --> 01:15:31.220]
Or small here's Miami Beach hello hey, yes, sir man. I'm pumped up all right

[01:15:31.220 --> 01:15:33.120]
Finally, we're gonna have some excitement

[01:15:33.120 --> 01:15:38.260]
But to a couple games a year, but I'm gonna go to a lot more games because it's exciting something new you know

[01:15:38.260 --> 01:15:42.940]
It's gonna be exciting. You know, it's gonna not gonna be some of the same old two yards in a cloud of dust really

[01:15:42.940 --> 01:15:47.840]
Let me ask your question off the subject to if you ever heard of a baseball player by the name of Bob Turley

[01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:51.280]
No, of course. I did 1956 Yankees 55

[01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:57.260]
He was on the same team with Don Larson and the Bob Grimm and those guys. I was a big Yankee fan in those days as a kid

[01:15:57.260 --> 01:16:03.780]
Now the reason I ever heard a bullet Bob Turley who started with the Baltimore Orioles by the way and then was traded to the Yankees

[01:16:03.780 --> 01:16:09.000]
Yeah, the reason I asked I was the rest of that pitching staff whitey Ford and Johnny Cux

[01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:14.880]
Right, yeah, I don't know because Jim Coates Jim Coates he left me some stuff of his

[01:16:14.880 --> 01:16:19.060]
Yeah, it's it worked anything. Are you better believe it? I've peddler right now

[01:16:19.060 --> 01:16:23.940]
I used to work for him and he just kind of took a liking to me and he left me like I got some baseball uniform

[01:16:23.940 --> 01:16:28.620]
Well, what kind of work was it if we said on the air? Oh, he was the insurance business. Yeah. Yeah

[01:16:29.040 --> 01:16:32.480]
What did he leave you pardon me he left you his balls? I got some

[01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:37.060]
Yeah, a lot of baseballs a uniform gloves some pictures

[01:16:37.060 --> 01:16:42.360]
Well, he left it with you like intentionally or like you gave it to me. Well, it's worth some stuff

[01:16:42.360 --> 01:16:47.380]
But you know it's worth some cash man. Where would I sell that at you find a collectibles place? Yeah

[01:16:47.380 --> 01:16:50.360]
Talk to one of them and then either that or put an ad in a collectibles

[01:16:50.360 --> 01:16:53.780]
magazine or something because you probably get ripped off by the collectibles people

[01:16:53.780 --> 01:16:57.980]
But he was pretty good in his family. He was outstanding. He had a tremendous fastball bullet bob

[01:16:57.980 --> 01:17:04.180]
Totally cool. That's right. He was fantastic. Great. Okay. I enjoy your show nice talking to you back to you

[01:17:04.180 --> 01:17:11.500]
So yeah bullet bob what number 19 my right is my memory right or what whitey Ford was 16. He was 19. What number was Don Larson

[01:17:12.840 --> 01:17:13.240]
18

[01:17:14.340 --> 01:17:15.860]
Come on one number was Don Larson

[01:17:15.860 --> 01:17:19.140]
I can see him now and at perfect game against Sal Magley in the Brooklyn Dodgers

[01:17:19.140 --> 01:17:25.640]
1956 World Series. I can see it right now Dale Mitchell is pinch hitting in the bottom of the ninth the count is one ball and two strikes

[01:17:25.640 --> 01:17:30.120]
And it's called strike three. I know hit a perfect game for Don Larson. I can see it now

[01:17:30.640 --> 01:17:35.640]
Well, he wear number 18 or what not that it's important. Trolley was 19. I know that I care. I bet my life on that

[01:17:36.520 --> 01:17:39.820]
Little wild there a little a control problem is most left-handers head

[01:17:39.820 --> 01:17:43.100]
No, tell me Bob filler was the left-hander anymore. I finally got that straightened out

[01:17:43.100 --> 01:17:48.020]
Herb scroll was the left-hander Cleveland Indians big cigar announcer now make believe a jocke announcer

[01:17:48.840 --> 01:17:51.020]
Bob Trolley bullet bob now we're talking

[01:17:52.860 --> 01:17:56.340]
Here's plantation hello, I'm come out. Yes, sir. Wonderful day

[01:17:57.120 --> 01:18:02.900]
Don truly drives a Ford and the Jim or drives a Corvette what is there need to say what does that tell you I rest my case

[01:18:02.900 --> 01:18:05.880]
I see you now now what we got to do is get rid of

[01:18:05.880 --> 01:18:10.880]
Dolphin Denny. Yes, and the picture. Oh, this is this is the best call of the day so far

[01:18:10.880 --> 01:18:13.940]
We that's to make the switch complete dolphin Denny must go

[01:18:13.940 --> 01:18:18.780]
Somebody who knows up Jimmy knows Jimmy call him up right now and tell him part of the deal with Wayne

[01:18:18.780 --> 01:18:23.040]
It must be in the contract is Dolphin Denny must go immediately if not sooner

[01:18:23.560 --> 01:18:29.220]
Neil you may not like this question long time. I don't like it long time with some or big fan of yours and

[01:18:29.220 --> 01:18:30.860]
But down the street from you

[01:18:31.480 --> 01:18:37.780]
The laughing Larry King call man called in came to your defense saying he was your dad and I know the story and everything

[01:18:37.780 --> 01:18:42.280]
You know what's really your dad. Yes. Well, you know what story what story is there

[01:18:42.820 --> 01:18:47.480]
Why I know you don't talk to him right and that's an ad that was him

[01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:51.940]
But how the hell would Phil Henry know that of course not yeah, I was just curious if it was a cranker food

[01:18:51.940 --> 01:18:56.520]
No, that was all what that was solid surfaces like about once every five years when

[01:18:57.080 --> 01:19:01.960]
Crawls over to the phone. It's a great day. I'm just curious if GJ doesn't go all the way

[01:19:01.960 --> 01:19:05.000]
What's gonna happen and how do people gonna react? Yeah, that'll be interesting

[01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:09.620]
You can probably predict it yourself because you know these people. I don't have fickle. They are very happy to all right

[01:19:10.020 --> 01:19:10.600]
See ya

[01:19:11.280 --> 01:19:13.560]
They're fickle not like me. I stick with my team

[01:19:15.300 --> 01:19:17.440]
Hey listen when you live here long enough it rubs off

[01:19:17.440 --> 01:19:22.980]
But I had good reason I make no apologies for even as bad as the Patriots stunk if should I would have been back next year

[01:19:22.980 --> 01:19:25.580]
I'd have been firmly on that Patriot bandwagon, okay

[01:19:26.140 --> 01:19:27.260]
Drew Blets. Oh God

[01:19:27.900 --> 01:19:33.320]
Bill parse and I got no problem with bill parcels. He's a great coach. I don't care how bad they stunk this year. He's a coach

[01:19:34.960 --> 01:19:38.820]
Fat but still a coach. It's 10 till noon at wio d

[01:19:39.580 --> 01:19:41.700]
Use talk entertainment radio

[01:19:42.820 --> 01:19:43.980]
610 wio

[01:19:45.020 --> 01:19:50.520]
Dallas blows and so does Jimmy Johnson you got that pal

[01:19:51.160 --> 01:19:56.360]
They were a group of unruly inner city students until she walked in

[01:19:56.360 --> 01:20:04.960]
Yes, what we're getting a new teacher. Yeah, it's probably an ugly old excuse me. Could I borrow your slide ruler?

[01:20:05.320 --> 01:20:10.060]
This summer Michelle Fyfe will be nurturing dirty minds

[01:20:10.920 --> 01:20:13.100]
Three times 23 equals

[01:20:13.880 --> 01:20:16.300]
69 yes, you know

[01:20:16.300 --> 01:20:17.220]
Math 30

[01:20:17.740 --> 01:20:19.960]
Who wants to bang my eraser

[01:20:22.040 --> 01:20:26.240]
After this class everybody needs a smoke in the boys room

[01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:30.100]
Michelle Fyfe stars and dirty minds coming soon

[01:20:30.100 --> 01:20:36.860]
Lisa horny 1154 at wio d we got an open line and broward like a big hole like a canyon there like a crater in Wayne's push

[01:20:37.980 --> 01:20:41.660]
5249 463 we're pretty happy with Wayne O. These days after this

[01:20:41.660 --> 01:20:43.240]
Baudzini business. No

[01:20:43.900 --> 01:20:45.240]
Here's a lady in Miami. Hello

[01:20:46.760 --> 01:20:50.600]
Lady in Miami is gone isn't that nice

[01:20:51.820 --> 01:20:53.600]
See what I mean about these women at colin

[01:20:53.600 --> 01:20:57.200]
I would say like 99% of the women I call in which is only about six anyway

[01:20:57.200 --> 01:20:59.700]
If you don't get to them right away, they're gone

[01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:06.420]
Because they have more important things than me which quite frankly I can't imagine too many things in this town more important than me bitch

[01:21:06.880 --> 01:21:09.980]
Open line and date with that bitch just hung up 751

[01:21:10.660 --> 01:21:12.180]
Here's the West Palm Beach hello

[01:21:12.180 --> 01:21:13.600]
Neil yes sir

[01:21:13.600 --> 01:21:16.500]
I'm happy about Jimmy becoming in can't hear you though your whispering

[01:21:16.500 --> 01:21:21.080]
Jimmy how I'm happy about Jimmy coming in but I got a problem with it. What's the problem?

[01:21:21.180 --> 01:21:23.280]
I think that's gonna mean Bobbi to the Panthers

[01:21:24.180 --> 01:21:27.620]
Don't you what is one thing have to do with the other I think it's a smoke screen

[01:21:28.100 --> 01:21:32.740]
I think you can be able to use this smoke screen. You people won't care as much wrong

[01:21:33.380 --> 01:21:35.700]
Okay wrong you'll care but I care a lot

[01:21:36.280 --> 01:21:40.800]
Okay, did you see a game last night? Of course with my cough to him in front of that. Well that all about

[01:21:41.340 --> 01:21:46.480]
He's spirit a guy and he got kicked out of the game for sparing that's right. Why wouldn't he replay? Why can we see what went up to that?

[01:21:47.440 --> 01:21:48.960]
They don't they don't replay penalties

[01:21:49.720 --> 01:21:51.580]
They don't know they don't

[01:21:51.580 --> 01:21:51.660]
I

[01:21:51.660 --> 01:21:58.780]
You sure about that I am so positive I bet you 80 million dollars against the nickel. They don't replay penalties

[01:21:58.780 --> 01:22:03.820]
I know the cover the camera guy sucks to that he can't cover the pocket they need to right

[01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:07.440]
But I thought I thought I've seen a replay with penalties before huh?

[01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:11.800]
I thought I've seen a place replay with penalties before no they have not they don't replay penalties

[01:22:12.280 --> 01:22:12.880]
Reason for

[01:22:13.520 --> 01:22:18.000]
And it's just a rule you do you can't you can only have replaced for certain things and penalties is not one of them

[01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:22.800]
That's a judgment thing no, I'm not saying why couldn't we watch the replay out? Oh, you mean why do they show the replay as well

[01:22:22.800 --> 01:22:27.900]
Again, why don't they show a lot of replays? You're a ask a ask Jeff Reemer when he gets back here ask the rim man

[01:22:27.900 --> 01:22:31.620]
Well, he doesn't have any control that well. He better start getting some control. I'll tell you that

[01:22:32.020 --> 01:22:33.040]
I'm a little bit

[01:22:33.620 --> 01:22:39.080]
So lost in game last game went but the penalty had nothing to do with the outcome of the game because they killed off the

[01:22:39.080 --> 01:22:42.960]
You're right. You're right, but I told you let down a third period like you said earlier

[01:22:42.960 --> 01:22:46.680]
So what was that about that's called crappy defense? That's called folding up like an accordion

[01:22:46.680 --> 01:22:49.200]
So it's called the bazaar lit in a greasy gold attire the game

[01:22:49.200 --> 01:22:51.960]
80 low. How we got down to that he's no these arm. I know

[01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:56.600]
But still you can't let a rapper on a greasy girl like that when you're going the wrong way you can't let that in there

[01:22:56.600 --> 01:23:00.860]
And by the way, I've been telling everybody about Patrick one how he stinks the joint out

[01:23:00.860 --> 01:23:03.260]
And if they saw that game last night, they know that I'm right

[01:23:03.260 --> 01:23:08.900]
Yeah, right. They came to have been like two to one. He stinks the joint out man. Colorado got a dead frog with that deal

[01:23:08.900 --> 01:23:13.640]
The set is gotta be just smoking to not a bento. Yeah, well he'll be in there soon believe me

[01:23:13.640 --> 01:23:14.100]
What

[01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.200]
You think what do you feel about the pantheon?

[01:23:19.740 --> 01:23:22.260]
I'd say a chance is our 99 to one against

[01:23:22.260 --> 01:23:28.160]
I hope I'm wrong, but don't look too good. Yeah, I'll see you next week game. Okay. See you

[01:23:28.160 --> 01:23:34.140]
Tuesday night we got the home game finally. Gee, it's a long drive because of that stinkin circus and all that elephant crap

[01:23:34.140 --> 01:23:35.740]
They're dumping all over the place in that arena

[01:23:36.220 --> 01:23:42.600]
Man, can you imagine the job that they must have to clean that thing out after the circus leaves town? Oh, we'd much rather have the circus

[01:23:42.600 --> 01:23:45.920]
It's such a wonderful atmosphere to take the children right

[01:23:46.820 --> 01:23:48.360]
Take your circus and jam it

[01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:55.980]
With your symphony orchestra too. Here's a mobile in four-lotterdale. Hello. Dale. Yes. Hey dumb buddy. Okay. One of your chronic. Yes, sir

[01:23:55.980 --> 01:24:02.700]
Did you say Jimmy was coming? Jimmy's coming. He's not even breathing hard. I don't think so. Squared, Squared

[01:24:02.700 --> 01:24:07.500]
Listen, I hope that if he doesn't come and Wayne was smiling about it, so what does that say?

[01:24:08.140 --> 01:24:10.380]
Yeah, he had the lightest teeth. I've ever come across

[01:24:11.720 --> 01:24:18.320]
Um, I hope that if he does come down here that we don't ruin him like we do all the other good players that we pick up

[01:24:18.320 --> 01:24:23.720]
All the good players. Is he gonna be playing or coaching? Well, well, we pick up a good player from another team

[01:24:23.720 --> 01:24:26.160]
They he comes up here as a dolphin

[01:24:26.160 --> 01:24:30.960]
Like Eric Green by the way, how come nobody mentioned what a great game key traction had for green Bay last week

[01:24:30.960 --> 01:24:35.360]
I noticed nobody mentioned that that he had some tremendous very pivotal catches in the green Bay win in the playoffs last

[01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:38.920]
Nobody mentions that. Yeah, and when he was with us last year

[01:24:40.200 --> 01:24:43.620]
Right, you know, I don't I think you'll find a different story with Jimmy

[01:24:43.620 --> 01:24:47.360]
When you get your new phone, I think you'll find it a lot less windy too

[01:24:48.060 --> 01:24:50.680]
We have an open line. Maybe you had the phone jammed up the wind tunnel

[01:24:50.680 --> 01:24:54.620]
Maybe that might have been it sounded awfully. I mean you're a good guy. I think but your phone blows

[01:24:54.620 --> 01:25:03.360]
Open line and Broward 5249 463 here's Miami, Buenos Satuya. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. How you doing? How about them? Doll fan? Yeah

[01:25:04.060 --> 01:25:10.980]
Jimmy joss in the best thing since the 71 72 season since hollava. Hey, how about 72 3 that sounds better to me

[01:25:10.980 --> 01:25:17.740]
Yes, 70 72 super bow 73 super bow. Yeah, oh, super bow. Yeah, everyone 72 season right we in there

[01:25:18.240 --> 01:25:28.040]

[01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:31.260]
All right go down. Okay. All right

[01:25:31.940 --> 01:25:32.340]
Open

[01:25:35.520 --> 01:25:38.080]
Open line and date. No. Yes, there is no

[01:25:39.740 --> 01:25:42.880]
75194. No, he's right like he said. No, there's not

[01:25:43.580 --> 01:25:46.300]
Okay, we don't have time this sir. We'll just just hang loose on here

[01:25:46.300 --> 01:25:50.380]
You're not going anywhere. It's kind of deadly. I noticed there was no traffic coming to work this morning kind of like a holiday

[01:25:50.380 --> 01:25:51.540]
Maybe that's what's going on

[01:25:51.540 --> 01:25:56.320]
Maybe people are parting in their pants today because I'm coming to work today. It was like a goddamn official holiday

[01:25:56.320 --> 01:26:02.040]
I have never ever never ever seen so little traffic on a non holiday non weekend day

[01:26:03.040 --> 01:26:05.740]
Did you see any traffic? Oh?

[01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:10.120]
You did or you didn't no, but you're not speaking now or what? I'm not to speak of

[01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:17.620]
I'm serious. There was like 75 was the grant me or just the nobody nowhere. Of course till you get to 79

[01:26:17.620 --> 01:26:19.100]
That's always jammed up with geeks

[01:26:19.860 --> 01:26:24.100]
But I mean, so it's a holiday excuse me for not understanding for not being a quick on the draw

[01:26:24.100 --> 01:26:30.340]
We hope you're enjoying your party and getting the good weed and doing the good stuff and the clean out those drugs and South Beach by the way

[01:26:30.340 --> 01:26:33.760]
No talk is cheap and man do we like it?

[01:26:33.820 --> 01:26:37.900]

To head the Miami Dolphins W I O D sports director Jeff de Forest reports on the hiring of KJ

[01:27:07.220 --> 01:27:12.500]
Jimmy's job hunt came to an abrupt end yesterday as Johnson got the job he had targeted for himself

[01:27:12.500 --> 01:27:16.320]
Ever since leaving the Dallas Cowboys after a tiff with owner Jerry Jones

[01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:24.220]
He began a relationship with Wayne Heisinga yesterday as the two hammered out a contract that will make Johnson the Finns third head coach in their history

[01:27:24.220 --> 01:27:26.460]
Johnson arrived at training camp early today

[01:27:26.460 --> 01:27:30.740]
Eight in the morning rolling up his sleeves and beginning his tenure as the Finns head coach

[01:27:30.740 --> 01:27:37.080]
Wayne Heisinga has already departed the Davey training camp meaning that a contract in all likelihood has already been signed

[01:27:37.080 --> 01:27:41.660]
The formal announcement should make it official today between four and four thirty this afternoon

[01:27:41.660 --> 01:27:48.340]
That didn't sound too enthusiastic. No, I tried again. Are you excited and enthused about Jimmy Johnson coming or what? Oh, yeah

[01:27:48.340 --> 01:27:49.500]
Work on it

[01:27:50.040 --> 01:27:50.520]

[01:28:15.080 --> 01:28:20.360]
Present Sean Connery and Richard Geer in a thrilling new version of the legend of Camelot

[01:28:20.360 --> 01:28:26.180]
There's a noble night outside. He wishes to join the round table King Arthur. Show him in

[01:28:26.780 --> 01:28:30.220]
Hi, your majesty. I'm Sir Lancelot that you can call me land

[01:28:30.220 --> 01:28:36.720]
Greetings Lance for the place is mine. It's the legendary story of King Arthur and his favorite night Lancelot

[01:28:36.780 --> 01:28:40.780]
As only Richard Geer could play him so how do you get to be king anyway?

[01:28:40.940 --> 01:28:47.400]
It was said that whoever could remove the sword Excalibur from the stone in which it was buried was the true king of England and you removed it?

[01:28:47.480 --> 01:28:52.220]
I did. Hmm. I've got something like that going really whoever so shall remove a certain

[01:28:52.220 --> 01:28:56.280]
Gerbil from my butt. Yes gets to replace it with something else

[01:28:56.280 --> 01:29:03.320]
Sean Connery Richard Geer and Freddie the hairless gerbil star in fist night. Actually my name's not really Lance the lot

[01:29:04.120 --> 01:29:09.520]
Then why do they call you Lancelot mostly because I get Lance the lot fist night coming soon to with the engineer

[01:29:09.520 --> 01:29:18.020]
No, no six at W I O D and let's go to West Palm Beach. Hello. Hey, how you doing? Okay. What is this with Eddie Bell for?

[01:29:18.440 --> 01:29:24.820]
He sucks. Why is he starting for the world? Because the fans voted don't you understand the Chicago fans?

[01:29:25.020 --> 01:29:32.220]
The stuff the ballot box either that or he's just his name. Now Stevie Wonder and Ray Charles were voting too

[01:29:32.220 --> 01:29:37.920]
Well, he's having a horrible year. He's not even a starter Jeff Hackett's starting Goli now Bell for his thanks to join out

[01:29:37.920 --> 01:29:44.000]
He's a second string gold tender Eddie the hummingbird for a lousy team on top of that well their mediocre at best. I hate them

[01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:49.740]
Now and what is this on another note with the all star voting by the way the Leafs are back in second place. Oh

[01:29:51.340 --> 01:29:55.160]
Yes, why was Ron Francis not picked up until the end?

[01:29:55.460 --> 01:29:57.840]
The guy is the second leading squad

[01:29:57.840 --> 01:30:04.420]
What do you mean picked up until the end? He was named as the Gary Betman the senior old timer or whatever that's why

[01:30:04.420 --> 01:30:12.400]
Well, it just seems to me like he should have been well. He wasn't over over Mario. Well, not over met

[01:30:12.400 --> 01:30:18.240]
Oh, that's right. They only picked the first guy don't they right? Well who picks the rest the coaches? The coaches picked the rest

[01:30:18.240 --> 01:30:22.920]
Well shouldn't the and then there's one old timer picked by Gary Betman for like each conference

[01:30:22.920 --> 01:30:29.100]
Ron Francis and Mike Gartner Mike Gartner at Leafs had another big goal last night. Oh, a beautiful play at a boy Mike

[01:30:29.100 --> 01:30:31.380]
Yeah, okay, so that's not actually

[01:30:32.100 --> 01:30:38.980]
It's a hot guy. It's a it's a popularity contest. Right garbage. Well, I mean he doesn't even play in the same line as Mario

[01:30:38.980 --> 01:30:39.600]
I mean

[01:30:39.600 --> 01:30:46.700]
I like except on the power and no one no one no one falls any of those guys anymore. Hey, what do you think the chancellor?

[01:30:46.700 --> 01:30:48.120]
Why do you say that?

[01:30:48.540 --> 01:30:53.240]
Why do you say that? Mario has people on his ass the entire game. They're all over him

[01:30:53.240 --> 01:30:57.440]
Well, I know but they don't you're just parroting what you heard somebody say who didn't know what he was talking about

[01:30:57.440 --> 01:31:03.440]
Mario gritskies the guy that nobody dares to touch. He's the untouchable one because I think they're afraid the smell is gonna rub off

[01:31:03.440 --> 01:31:04.680]
Well, I mean they don't see no

[01:31:04.680 --> 01:31:11.020]
They're only averaging like two power plays a game for the last month the penguins are no one's no one's found any of those guys

[01:31:11.020 --> 01:31:15.880]
Because they know how deadly that power play is and and what do you think the chances are that one being the best one ever

[01:31:16.440 --> 01:31:18.920]
Of what one the penguins powerfully now

[01:31:19.760 --> 01:31:24.740]
It's I don't know how you compare it with other it's very hard to do, but it's certainly the best in league

[01:31:24.740 --> 01:31:31.400]
It's it's awesome. It's incredible to watch. Okay, and and go Jimmy. That's great. Okay. Oh, see you

[01:31:33.100 --> 01:31:36.400]
We have an open line in the green line what and green land

[01:31:36.400 --> 01:31:40.040]
1-800-944 we could probably get better response on green land

[01:31:40.040 --> 01:31:44.000]
I'll tell you that those back suits they have nothing else to talk about do people actually live there?

[01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:50.220]
Then I love the guy that calls up Phil yesterday to show you how confused the public is this guy calls up when you know

[01:31:50.220 --> 01:31:54.040]
Our Rick it was a Julio so that explains that they're confused. They got like a gender

[01:31:55.060 --> 01:32:01.440]
Confusion thing there so he's talking about all the rest of the station and this and that and well, you know Rick gets to go to all these

[01:32:01.440 --> 01:32:04.980]
Exciting places and the Phil says you mean Neil. Oh, yeah, well, he has been the Amsterdam

[01:32:07.040 --> 01:32:11.880]
They don't have any idea who they're listening to who's saying what they're they're like clueless

[01:32:11.880 --> 01:32:14.320]
They couldn't tell you if you held a gun to their head. No

[01:32:15.220 --> 01:32:16.360]
Here's sunrise. Hello

[01:32:17.080 --> 01:32:20.560]
Hey, Neil. How's it going buddy? Okay, palie. All right, man

[01:32:21.360 --> 01:32:25.180]
I've been down here for a while and I haven't been a big dolphins fan

[01:32:25.180 --> 01:32:33.540]
But I just say man, I'm totally happy now. Yeah, and I want to see my stealers at least you know go to this Super Bowl before the dolphins dominate the whole thing

[01:32:33.540 --> 01:32:35.400]
Yeah, and another thing

[01:32:36.480 --> 01:32:40.180]
Um, I heard you play this thing like a spoof of macarena

[01:32:40.180 --> 01:32:42.640]
I was wondering if you could play that again. It's called melanoma

[01:32:43.880 --> 01:32:48.840]
Melanoma is a spoof of mech green no macarena, you know that stupid I saw

[01:32:48.840 --> 01:32:54.760]
When you go and say this is spoof of mech green. Did you hear that jurors? Yeah, I know what you're talking about even. I'm not that stupid

[01:32:54.760 --> 01:32:58.740]
Yeah, although terrible. It's a total Miami thing, but you know, yeah

[01:32:59.900 --> 01:33:00.340]
Okay

[01:33:01.120 --> 01:33:06.720]

[01:35:52.420 --> 01:35:55.960]
Used to be a guest on my show back at osgood old old old days

[01:35:55.960 --> 01:35:57.560]
Well, Elliott's a son needs a good guy

[01:35:57.560 --> 01:36:07.280]
So anyway the story is alleged sins of priest resurface after 25 years and alter boy story begins in the late 1960s in a Boynton beach parish

[01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:13.780]
In 1967 when Kevin Ralph Sidway was an 11-year-old Catholic alter boy

[01:36:13.780 --> 01:36:21.340]
He and at least four other boys from a Boynton beach parish told their parents the Reverend Rocco Charles de Angelo had sexually assaulted them father

[01:36:21.340 --> 01:36:22.460]
Oh, too God

[01:36:22.460 --> 01:36:28.000]
DeAngelo admitted to being a molester in the church when it apparently done nothing when it received a similar reporting year earlier

[01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:32.660]
Send him to a psych psychiatric hospital document show for the next quarter century

[01:36:32.660 --> 01:36:39.840]
Sidway wrestled with his demons attempting suicide at least once his only consolation his faith that the church would make sure as a

[01:36:39.840 --> 01:36:42.840]
Salem never again worked with the parishioners especially children

[01:36:42.840 --> 01:36:44.740]
But during all that time

[01:36:44.740 --> 01:36:51.980]
DeAngelo continued his priestly duties on the Gulf Coast including two stances head of a Tampa area church before retiring in 1993

[01:36:53.140 --> 01:36:58.080]
And it goes on and on it says diocese is still paying for alleged sins

[01:36:58.920 --> 01:37:02.000]
Halle Luia, but another isolated incident father old too

[01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:07.160]
Just one of the millions of stories out there in the Naked City with all those priests, huh? What can I tell you?

[01:37:08.300 --> 01:37:09.800]

[01:37:19.760 --> 01:37:27.220]
I am thrilled. Thank God and to be honest with you I sit in the wedge by the opponent side and that's where

[01:37:28.360 --> 01:37:32.740]
That stupid guy with that orange hat. What's the thing? It's all fanned. Denny. Yes. He stands there

[01:37:32.740 --> 01:37:38.400]
Believe me. We heckle my sister and I heckle him every game. He could be the world's biggest asshole

[01:37:38.400 --> 01:37:42.940]
Yeah, we tell next to Larry King. He's so drunk. Yeah, I mean it's disgusting

[01:37:42.940 --> 01:37:48.260]
So Jimmy, please get rid of that is often done. Yeah, hey him amen and the third thing

[01:37:48.260 --> 01:37:52.540]
I wanted to let you know because I don't think anybody has told you yet the guy from the guiding light the one

[01:37:52.540 --> 01:37:55.620]
That played the was the man and the woman whatever rent Lawrence. Yeah

[01:37:56.460 --> 01:37:58.620]
It was in the paper yesterday in the herald

[01:37:59.220 --> 01:38:05.380]
It was reported they found him in his dressing room. Yeah, going crazy removing his clothes and

[01:38:06.240 --> 01:38:06.940]
Flipping out

[01:38:06.940 --> 01:38:14.120]
Are you cereal? He had a nervous breakdown. He started removing his clothes and he was naked in his dressing room

[01:38:14.120 --> 01:38:18.640]
Oh my god. What a grotesque thought and now was he marion or Brent at the time?

[01:38:18.960 --> 01:38:22.720]
Who knows? I don't know if he was wearing a bra or you know underwear, but or both

[01:38:23.440 --> 01:38:27.140]
He was he's apparently that's why nobody has said anything

[01:38:27.140 --> 01:38:32.240]
He's apparently some kind of a sanatorium or some psychiatric ward. He's like flipped out. Oh my god

[01:38:32.240 --> 01:38:35.520]
See those soaps will drive you crazy whether you're watching them or in them

[01:38:35.520 --> 01:38:42.280]
Well, you know, he's probably real confused. I would think so he was like three people and he didn't like to be wearing all that heavy pancake makeup over that

[01:38:42.280 --> 01:38:45.980]
Phony Puss. He wasn't sure what the heck he was you know, he was there

[01:38:45.980 --> 01:38:48.280]
So that's why you've been having all these lousy

[01:38:49.040 --> 01:38:52.360]
Actors on there because they can't seem to find anybody. It was like such short notice

[01:38:52.360 --> 01:38:58.920]
Yeah, and I guess he ain't coming back at any time soon. No, I don't think so unless it's in a straight jacket or something like that

[01:38:59.500 --> 01:38:59.860]
Inclable

Have I ever been in Davie? Yeah, where's that? I heard that you've been in Davie quite a few times

[01:47:48.540 --> 01:47:50.660]
No, I have been through Davie very rapidly

[01:47:51.220 --> 01:47:53.220]
Oh, yeah, why how did Davie like it?

[01:47:53.760 --> 01:48:00.500]
How did what how did Davie like it Davie what well you said you've been in Davie Davie Jones? Yeah, yeah

[01:48:01.020 --> 01:48:02.900]
See you. Bye asshole

[01:48:03.620 --> 01:48:11.480]
Open line on the green line 1-800-944 in fact my roommate's name in college where he was from Jersey and his name was Tom Davie and I never was in Davie

[01:48:13.060 --> 01:48:15.320]
But that's another story. Okay, he was kind of ugly

[01:48:16.100 --> 01:48:20.640]
Here's a four-loader Dale. Hello. How you doing Neil? Okay. All right. That was guy was really unbalanced

[01:48:20.660 --> 01:48:25.020]
He was he was as good as that other guy before who was trying so hard to be funny that he cracked him

[01:48:25.020 --> 01:48:28.120]
He cracked up at the end of the call couldn't keep us straight push. Yeah, I know. Yeah

[01:48:29.600 --> 01:48:33.600]
See they see there's a whole there all these different groups of types of callers

[01:48:33.600 --> 01:48:38.840]
We have the callers who think that they're gonna get my goat and get me all worked up by calling and pretending that they hate me

[01:48:38.840 --> 01:48:43.680]
Or they're gonna say take some a shot and they think that I'm gonna take it personal where this to me is business

[01:48:43.680 --> 01:48:47.240]
I couldn't give a crap what they say as long as the phone rings as long as I get the paycheck

[01:48:47.240 --> 01:48:52.620]
Which I already got my check by the way this morning sir and that's it and they really believe that we

[01:48:52.620 --> 01:48:55.560]
Take these things seriously. They're just paying your check

[01:48:55.560 --> 01:48:59.780]
And if they ever if they ever heard the callers on the Phil Henry show including Larry King

[01:48:59.780 --> 01:49:03.340]
They know that they're not serious. Oh, right. Well, they you know, they're just

[01:49:03.340 --> 01:49:07.360]
They keep listening because they love you that's they do they couldn't they couldn't live without it

[01:49:07.360 --> 01:49:11.580]
But home with the flu today and opened up the paper and it was

[01:49:12.540 --> 01:49:16.400]
Can't wait for a Jimmy to start kicking everybody out and bringing everybody in

[01:49:16.900 --> 01:49:19.160]
Just wanted to say Jimmy Johnson Lordy

[01:49:19.920 --> 01:49:21.480]
Lordy Lordy yeah and

[01:49:21.480 --> 01:49:26.760]
I don't know if anybody else has noticed this, but this is the second time in a row now I hate Wayne

[01:49:26.760 --> 01:49:29.980]
But I mean I hate the Tampa Bay area even more than Wayne

[01:49:29.980 --> 01:49:35.260]
And this is the second time in a row that Wayne has personally shot upon the Tampa Bay area good for him

[01:49:35.260 --> 01:49:38.260]
I mean if you notice before thanks a lot Wayne. We love you. He did

[01:49:38.260 --> 01:49:40.440]
Well and now with Jimmy right

[01:49:41.520 --> 01:49:45.720]
Great anybody who dumps on Tampa Bay can't be all bad in our book right? No, yes

[01:49:46.500 --> 01:49:48.580]
All right, Dale. Okay, pal. See ya

[01:49:48.580 --> 01:49:52.440]
Get some clear a seal for Wayne. Okay, let's clear up our relationship with Wayne

[01:49:53.020 --> 01:49:57.920]
And that ugly push too. We have an opal on and brown or five two four nine four six three five two four

[01:49:57.920 --> 01:50:00.860]
It's like that Julio that called Phil yesterday. Oh, I hate that deal

[01:50:00.860 --> 01:50:05.880]
I hate that he said that and he goes on and on and then he starts using every expression from douchebag to

[01:50:06.360 --> 01:50:09.360]
Unbelieveable. I mean this guy. He could quote chapter in verse this kid

[01:50:09.360 --> 01:50:15.140]
Everything I've ever said on a year and of course he's probably a closet case and he's you know wrestling with it and his conscience too

[01:50:16.480 --> 01:50:18.760]
Here's a four-lawed nine. It's not W. I. O. D

[01:50:19.200 --> 01:50:21.020]
I'd like to speak to Neil Rogers who?

[01:50:21.620 --> 01:50:27.660]
Neil Rogers why you're like you sure what love it. Oh, thank god. Hello. Hello. This is me. Neil. Yeah. How you doing?

[01:50:27.880 --> 01:50:31.460]
Jack hey Jack pretty good. Um, I was gonna ask you a question

[01:50:32.760 --> 01:50:36.940]
About a boxing question. I don't know if we were talking on sports here. That was a boxing question

[01:50:37.640 --> 01:50:42.920]
Boxing is barbaric and grotesque come on come on. It is one of the greatest sport. No, it is not

[01:50:42.920 --> 01:50:47.020]
It's not a sport at all. Let me say it again. It's boxing and boxing is grotesque and barbaric

[01:50:47.020 --> 01:50:50.040]
I think it's hard to think see

[01:50:51.760 --> 01:50:55.860]
Yeah, okay, well anyway, let me ask you a question. Um, have you heard of the spider courage to shock?

[01:50:56.360 --> 01:51:00.940]
After I just got through saying that why would you ask me a question about boxing? It's not a sport. I don't follow it

[01:51:00.940 --> 01:51:04.320]
I have no interest in it's grotesque and barbaric. I heard somebody just say that

[01:51:05.040 --> 01:51:05.780]
It's crap

[01:51:06.580 --> 01:51:07.900]
It's for sadists

[01:51:08.800 --> 01:51:14.080]
All right, it's for people like cauliflower ears. It's for people who want to see the faces of death parts one through a thousand

[01:51:14.080 --> 01:51:14.840]
Have you seen those?

[01:51:15.160 --> 01:51:18.960]
I've seen them. Well, there you go. That's why you're like boxing. I'll answer this call up the weather channel

[01:51:18.960 --> 01:51:24.220]
They're selling a video of 80,000 greatest disasters of man. You can see bodies blown apart. You can see like all kinds of

[01:51:24.220 --> 01:51:29.260]
Christ right now, huh? Who could be pricing right now? Princess Diana. We have an open line and the brower line

[01:51:30.240 --> 01:51:35.160]
524946. Do you see you guys with your boxing man? See this is a joke and

[01:51:35.160 --> 01:51:41.020]
They're hosting you like crazy and you pay money for these fights to subsidize these overgrown morons these illiterate assholes

[01:51:41.020 --> 01:51:44.200]
And if they put it on pay-per-view you spend your last 30 or 40 bucks

[01:51:44.200 --> 01:51:47.640]
You can't even put a goddamn loaf of bread in the salami sandwich on the table

[01:51:47.640 --> 01:51:52.220]
But give me my 30 or 40 bucks so I can support this guy and then half of marfixed anyway

[01:51:52.800 --> 01:51:56.180]
It's like professional wrestling now. Oh, don't say that. Yes, it is

[01:51:57.960 --> 01:52:02.300]
Right, I think it's how they think see I see

[01:52:03.140 --> 01:52:07.820]
Here's Miami. Hello. Hey, no, what he means is it's hard to think when you've had your brains bashed in for 10 years

[01:52:08.220 --> 01:52:13.060]
You're a number one cheerleader. Yes, I believe these people are not excited about they're not at all excited

[01:52:13.060 --> 01:52:17.780]
I'm the only one you and me about 10 other people. That's all that's all I care about is the same old tired crap

[01:52:17.780 --> 01:52:22.960]
Yeah, maybe if you put on a dress and chose a little ass and we go to your ass and make up maybe we'll get excited

[01:52:22.960 --> 01:52:26.180]
Yeah, right not all of those like peepies like you yeah

[01:52:26.660 --> 01:52:31.940]
So I said that man shows a mask man, you know, you show some ass look at a mirror pal. You can't get bigger than that

[01:52:31.940 --> 01:52:34.440]
See there you go just exactly what I just got through sand

[01:52:34.920 --> 01:52:39.180]
There is one right there just exactly what I said right there just look at the mirror man

[01:52:39.780 --> 01:52:42.180]
I hope he's got one of those big tall ones in a mirror too

[01:52:43.320 --> 01:52:48.020]
Here's Miami on a purple line. Hello. Hello, Neil. Yes. How you doing? Okay

[01:52:48.560 --> 01:52:52.620]
Well Jimmy Johnson coming to town is their best thing since the signing of Damorino. Yeah

[01:52:53.560 --> 01:52:59.600]
I just can't wait to see the cut list. Oh by the way, there was a Holy O just now. So obviously he was wrong. He does like it. Yeah

[01:53:00.480 --> 01:53:03.060]
And uh trust me they all like it a lot

[01:53:03.660 --> 01:53:07.840]
Uh, I can't wait for George and he's not a real spick anyway. I can't wait to take out JB Brown

[01:53:07.840 --> 01:53:13.480]
Yeah, I mean all you slow guys. Right right Jean Atkins. Jean Atkins got to go right

[01:53:13.480 --> 01:53:15.460]
I hope Brian cars get that out of here too

[01:53:16.320 --> 01:53:19.080]
And uh, just hope Jimmy turns everything around and we can uh

[01:53:19.080 --> 01:53:23.480]
I hope they sit Brian in a back of the bus so we can like look forward and spit on everybody else

[01:53:23.480 --> 01:53:30.140]
I just uh, and Tarell Buckley get him on at bus two right away. Yeah, I mean I this is I'm an avid

[01:53:30.140 --> 01:53:34.420]
daughter fan and uh, I just didn't even want to watch football this year

[01:53:34.420 --> 01:53:38.860]
You're gonna see a whole new rage rage team this year. I'll guarantee you that you can go to the bank on it

[01:53:38.860 --> 01:53:43.340]
And I hope so no more of this three-and-out bull crap that we've been watching for four or five years now

[01:53:43.340 --> 01:53:47.220]
Yeah, I think I hope he gets really good. Steven's too. I mean, I don't think so

[01:53:47.220 --> 01:53:50.100]
I think that's the one thing I'm a little concerned about but hey listen a guy

[01:53:50.100 --> 01:53:54.400]
You gotta give him a little bit of a vote of confidence because he seems to know what he's doing

[01:53:54.400 --> 01:53:58.180]
So you know, yeah, maybe he's got the right pill for uh for him to take

[01:53:58.520 --> 01:54:03.900]
And maybe he knows where to stick it and uh and I think we're lyricing his film. Yeah, that was the funniest thing I've ever heard

[01:54:03.900 --> 01:54:07.460]
No, yes, it was I had to pull it out of the way. It's 10 minutes in history. No, yes

[01:54:08.340 --> 01:54:10.840]
All right, Neil. Thanks. I'll have a great day pal. See you

[01:54:11.480 --> 01:54:15.460]
Yes, see that was another thing filled comes on her does the best 10 minutes in the history

[01:54:15.460 --> 01:54:18.780]
First of all to show you what a bush Lake town it is this Melissa Ruggieri

[01:54:18.780 --> 01:54:23.260]
She writes some shot at me because Larry says it's the worst talk show in America instead of writing

[01:54:23.260 --> 01:54:27.420]
Phil Henry did the greatest con job on Larry King and history made a jackass out of him

[01:54:27.420 --> 01:54:30.380]
She writes, uh, you know, some backhanded shot about me. Oh, yes

[01:54:31.280 --> 01:54:33.900]
And then Phil gets done with that thing and the phone is like dead

[01:54:33.900 --> 01:54:37.920]
It's like there's no response out there where people ought to be just ring the phone off the hook in his

[01:54:37.920 --> 01:54:40.100]
Thericks just peeing in their pantalones

[01:54:40.100 --> 01:54:42.160]
It's just uh amazing

[01:54:42.160 --> 01:54:47.100]
Just never ceases the shock and amaze no matter how often you see it and feel it and smell it

[01:54:48.280 --> 01:54:50.940]
It's 237 at W. I. O. D.

[01:54:50.940 --> 01:54:56.420]
A deeper covering the news of South Florida and a guy on the prowl in Washington correspondence in LA

[01:54:56.420 --> 01:54:58.460]
Chicago, Atlanta and around the world

[01:54:58.460 --> 01:55:02.640]
That's why you get the best news on news talking entertainment radio

[01:55:03.240 --> 01:55:05.240]
610 W I O D

[01:55:05.240 --> 01:55:09.040]
Spread them and say cheese. No, yeah, kid baby

[01:55:10.560 --> 01:55:12.260]
She night and a current affair

[01:55:12.260 --> 01:55:16.460]
Shocking videos of the Brady bunches all night wesson oil orgies

[01:55:16.460 --> 01:55:18.380]
How about you sitting here? You ready for it? Yeah

[01:55:18.380 --> 01:55:22.960]
Plus never before seen episodes too racy for network television

[01:55:22.960 --> 01:55:25.140]
Mom, mom, it's coming and coming

[01:55:25.140 --> 01:55:27.040]
Aw, congratulations, honey

[01:55:27.040 --> 01:55:29.180]
Why don't you go tell Alice the news? She's in her room

[01:55:29.180 --> 01:55:31.160]
That's tonight on a current affair

[01:55:31.700 --> 01:55:35.200]
We forget our topic tomorrow will be a Julio's flying out of the closet

[01:55:35.200 --> 01:55:38.180]
We probably have to extend the show so Phil may be able to take the day off tomorrow

[01:55:38.180 --> 01:55:39.380]
That'll get that one guy upset

[01:55:40.420 --> 01:55:42.820]
1241 at W. I. O. D. We have a line ringing in date

[01:55:42.820 --> 01:55:47.680]
I just mentioned that in passing 7519 463 751

[01:55:47.680 --> 01:55:49.240]
Here's Davie. Hello

[01:55:50.200 --> 01:55:54.260]
Hello. Yes. Yes. It's in about time you leave Don Shulalone

[01:55:54.260 --> 01:55:58.520]
What is it? Leave Don Shulalone. He retired. Is everybody happy now?

[01:55:58.700 --> 01:56:02.180]
Is this a woman or a man? It's a man. I got a cold. Oh my god

[01:56:03.620 --> 01:56:05.840]
This isn't Brett Lawrence is it from the guiding light?

[01:56:06.440 --> 01:56:09.520]
Put your clothes back on Brett come on people are starting to talk

[01:56:09.520 --> 01:56:12.180]
I'm to leave him alone. What do you mean by leaving him alone?

[01:56:12.380 --> 01:56:15.980]
I'm asking him. Nobody's even talking about him today barely. We're talking about Jimmy Johnson

[01:56:15.980 --> 01:56:19.480]
So in other words if we in other words we shouldn't be happy that Jimmy Johnson is coming

[01:56:19.480 --> 01:56:24.220]
We should be in mourning for a few months. Would that make you happy? Oh that's that's what the problem is

[01:56:24.220 --> 01:56:28.020]
It's got nothing to do with Shulal you don't like Jimmy Johnson. That's what it is. So why didn't you say that?

[01:56:28.720 --> 01:56:31.360]
What is it? He wants he doesn't make it

[01:56:31.960 --> 01:56:35.260]
You hope he doesn't make it. Yeah, he's a jerk and

[01:56:35.260 --> 01:56:38.060]
You're a jerk takes one to no one. Okay asshole

[01:56:38.840 --> 01:56:42.960]
Open line and powered five two four now we're getting the good colors that I was talking about a little moments ago

[01:56:42.960 --> 01:56:46.580]
This is what it's all about in this town one asshole after another

[01:56:48.240 --> 01:56:51.780]
Five two four nine four six three five two four W.O.D

[01:56:51.780 --> 01:56:57.060]
It hopes that Jimmy and I say it the you know very uh, I'm not really sure what that was

[01:56:57.800 --> 01:57:01.480]
I think it was Brett Lawrence come on put put it back on the show

[01:57:01.480 --> 01:57:03.300]
So maybe he's losing his mind that would be great

[01:57:03.300 --> 01:57:10.560]
Can you imagine that just absolutely for real psycho he might actually throw Lucy right off the goddamn light light tower the lighthouse

[01:57:10.560 --> 01:57:12.180]
Whatever it is lighthouse for the stupid

[01:57:13.380 --> 01:57:17.900]
Here's for Lauderdale. Hello. Hey Neil how you doing today? Okay, sounds like you got a bunch of real air

[01:57:17.900 --> 01:57:20.720]
We got it listen. We got asked up to your earlobes today, man

[01:57:23.520 --> 01:57:26.680]
And this goes to Shulal this is the response from the iode audience

[01:57:26.680 --> 01:57:29.160]
We got a bunch of wiseasses out there who like you know

[01:57:29.160 --> 01:57:32.880]
How can it's gotta be the best thing that happened to this town? I'm telling a long time

[01:57:32.880 --> 01:57:38.380]
I mean I can't think of anything else too great going on here. I want to know if I love the Doddy and Steven's a split in the cab fair from

[01:57:38.380 --> 01:57:43.700]
Davie to the airport. They're in Davie is what I hear they're gonna split the cab there. We're gonna spend a lot of time in Davie

[01:57:43.700 --> 01:57:48.480]
Did you hear the Hummer last night? No, I did not thank God. Yeah, well he listened to your show

[01:57:48.480 --> 01:57:53.600]
I think you maybe you pay him back by listening to his now once in a great while during a break any let me say it again

[01:57:53.600 --> 01:57:58.480]
Anybody that would listen to the Hummer while Phil Henry is on the year needs very serious assistance

[01:57:58.480 --> 01:58:03.520]
Well actually was in the the end of Phil Henry and D.Fo was coming on so like I said that was

[01:58:03.520 --> 01:58:10.800]
That I understand it less or two evo yeah, and he had the penthouse pet of the year on his show in his studio

[01:58:10.800 --> 01:58:14.480]
What does that have to do with sports that's what I wanted. I know I could figure out

[01:58:14.480 --> 01:58:18.640]
But he had the penthouse pet of the year in his studio and they were

[01:58:18.640 --> 01:58:24.940]
She was gonna be performing at some club in Miami and they were going on and saying that there was a free buffet at this club

[01:58:24.940 --> 01:58:31.260]
Oh, so that's what it was. No. Yes, it was more free food for the hamster and he says well

[01:58:31.260 --> 01:58:33.860]
What untmys the buffet starting they said it's the clock

And they're talking about everything but in this town. I don't get it. I just don't understand it

[01:58:56.960 --> 01:59:00.840]

[01:59:00.840 --> 01:59:03.300]
And somebody be calling to ask if they're still going to have the early bird

[01:59:03.900 --> 01:59:05.600]

crawling out of their crack when he starts winning and his team starts winning

[01:59:52.660 --> 01:59:53.360]

[02:02:14.620 --> 02:02:19.460]
I mean it's just a bandwagon to let's stay there and I let's give this guy a chance for a three or four games

[02:02:19.460 --> 02:02:21.320]
And I think there's all that he knows it will

[02:02:21.940 --> 02:02:27.780]
Well, I'm not trying to suck around now, but I do think that uh this shows the the power that you have in this town

That's right uh, you know

[02:02:29.160 --> 02:02:33.460]
Because considering it's the worst talk show in America. It's amazing that I have this much power

[02:03:51.100 --> 02:03:56.320]
And why is that we keep investigating that we can't come up with an answer probably because some shoddy assholes

[02:03:59.700 --> 02:04:02.340]

Yeah, Neil yes, sir. How you doing? Okay, how the worst phones are people's telephone

[02:04:09.820 --> 02:04:11.580]
I think anyway up here in west Palm Beach

[02:04:12.100 --> 02:04:18.480]
For the payphone what is that that's a company that's one of the most do it's called people's telephone to really do it

[02:04:18.480 --> 02:04:19.260]
Your quarters

[02:04:20.840 --> 02:04:23.080]
Listen, we've been hearing a rumor up here that uh

[02:04:23.600 --> 02:04:25.440]
They made an offer for the panthers up here

[02:04:26.240 --> 02:04:32.200]
And they've been screwed around by Wayne or whatever it is yeah, which probably sounds like he's probably trying to you know up the price

[02:04:32.200 --> 02:04:36.400]
Panthers aren't going to Palm Beach pal forget about that the panthers are not going to Palm Beach

[02:04:36.400 --> 02:04:40.180]
Nobody wants to go to Palm Beach. Oh, it's not that bad. It is

[02:04:40.600 --> 02:04:45.240]
No, nobody's gonna go to Palm Beach. It's not gonna happen. Let me ask you were they gonna play?

[02:04:45.360 --> 02:04:50.820]
Well, the group that made the offer has a stadium fight already. So yeah, they also want an NFL team up

[02:04:50.820 --> 02:04:53.180]
You know, uh, you know, Pittsburgh

[02:04:53.180 --> 02:04:54.720]
Uh-huh, you know

[02:04:56.040 --> 02:04:58.320]
Nobody's going with you let me say it again

[02:04:58.320 --> 02:05:03.060]
There is nobody going to nobody is going to west Palm Beach to a hockey game

[02:05:03.060 --> 02:05:08.420]
I'm telling you that right now well if the panthers go you can come up and see our local team. We're not going

[02:05:09.740 --> 02:05:12.340]
Let me say it again don't take it personally unless you want to

[02:05:12.340 --> 02:05:14.520]
We are not going to west Palm Beach

[02:05:14.520 --> 02:05:19.420]
We are not driving all the way up there in arm and leg to west Palm to see anything

[02:05:19.420 --> 02:05:23.540]
Listen, we're all getting in the bus to go down and buy our season tickets. All right

[02:05:23.540 --> 02:05:24.900]

[02:05:42.760 --> 02:05:47.420]
Stort would be good, which I don't think is even in Palm Beach is it isn't that Martin County or some uh, you know

[02:05:47.420 --> 02:05:48.120]
Yokeal thing like that

[02:05:48.740 --> 02:05:53.080]
Let's put them up there like in Fort Pierce so we can have a nice relaxing drive to and from the game

[02:05:54.480 --> 02:05:56.240]
Here's a plantation. Hello

[02:05:57.180 --> 02:06:00.320]
Hey Neil. Yes, sir. How you doing? Okay? I forgot about me

[02:06:01.900 --> 02:06:08.340]
Um and I have a question for you. Yeah, this guy called a little while ago said everything south floor to have brown eyes

[02:06:08.340 --> 02:06:09.700]
What the hell does that mean?

[02:06:10.480 --> 02:06:14.940]
You have any idea? He has said something after that we had a dump so I would consider the source okay

[02:06:14.940 --> 02:06:18.760]
Well, that's good because he's a jet span. Oh, is that it? So if that tells you anything

[02:06:19.600 --> 02:06:23.660]
He's a loser. Well, he ought to know his crap then because if he's a jet span. He's got it up to his eyeballs

[02:06:24.920 --> 02:06:28.360]
Definitely, I'm at least you know, we're gonna get Jimmy Johnson. He's got rich co-tights

[02:06:28.360 --> 02:06:33.000]
So I guess he's got a lot to talk about there you go. I am very excited about Jimmy being here. Yeah

[02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:36.660]
So I'm one of a few and uh, we're strong. We'll be all right

[02:06:36.660 --> 02:06:38.920]
Okay, but don't overdo it because they're getting pissed off

[02:06:39.380 --> 02:06:44.820]
Okay, have a great day, but don't don't party too much because they're getting pissed off because they don't want anybody to be positive

[02:06:44.820 --> 02:06:46.020]
They love the negativity

[02:06:46.460 --> 02:06:50.300]
See, I've known that all the time that I've been here anytime you try to be positive on anything

[02:06:50.300 --> 02:06:53.920]
They get very upset about that and as much as they bitch at me. Oh, you're so negative

[02:06:53.920 --> 02:06:59.160]
What are we gonna get somebody out who's more positive and then anytime you find something that you really enjoy and that you like

[02:06:59.160 --> 02:07:02.240]
Oh, we're y'all want to hear about that now that's boring

[02:07:03.080 --> 02:07:08.700]
We want to hear a bitch in screaming belly it can complain. Okay, you suck. How's that y'all suck

[02:07:10.440 --> 02:07:11.240]
Now they're happy

[02:07:11.960 --> 02:07:16.000]
We have an open line on the uh per on the uh whatever that line is there the bokeh-pom beach line

[02:07:16.020 --> 02:07:21.340]
They're also ecstatic because we're gonna have all our teams up in Palm Beach County and everybody like from Kendall and down there in homestead

[02:07:21.340 --> 02:07:26.160]
We're all gonna get on god damn bus loads and truck loads and slip all the way up there, right? I don't think so

[02:07:27.960 --> 02:07:29.200]
Here's my me lakes hello

[02:07:30.700 --> 02:07:35.760]
Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. How you doing? Okay, hey listen now I was talking uh, I was listening last night rather than D-fo

[02:07:35.760 --> 02:07:41.600]
Yeah, what is it like once a week? He just goes off unrestling. He talked like for 20 30 minutes unrestling

[02:07:41.600 --> 02:07:44.380]
See that's what I'm talking about here. We got the big story in fact

[02:07:44.380 --> 02:07:48.180]
He's not even speculating. I mean, he's just already announcing it as though it's a done deal

[02:07:48.180 --> 02:07:51.560]
Jimmy Johnson is the new coach and then he went off on all these other things

[02:07:51.560 --> 02:07:58.500]
I mean, it's talking first he was talking about boxing and then he went off to wrestling and then my radio went off because I thought what what is this

[02:07:58.500 --> 02:08:04.420]
What's the difference between those two? I don't get it. I'm sorry. I don't understand what kind of like I've said the sports shows in this town

[02:08:04.420 --> 02:08:05.100]
They all suck

[02:08:07.100 --> 02:08:08.540]
Listen about the story

[02:08:08.540 --> 02:08:13.480]
Jennifer was talking about necrophilia. We have to pass a law about necrophilia now. Oh absolutely

[02:08:13.840 --> 02:08:14.200]
Yeah

[02:08:14.200 --> 02:08:18.660]
What's the guy who's gonna testify against the guy who's committing the act by the way? I don't know

[02:08:18.660 --> 02:08:20.820]
But I think he I think he's kind of quasi-modo

[02:08:20.820 --> 02:08:25.920]
And has been hanging out in the entry. How many how many people is that law gonna affect you think there's Moral

[02:08:27.340 --> 02:08:30.920]
Hey, let's keep the drug. There's a lot of walking stiffs out there. I think that counts too

[02:08:32.140 --> 02:08:36.840]
Okay, listen. There's a look. Let's keep the drugs out of South Beach bars and back in the high schools where they belong all right

[02:08:36.840 --> 02:08:43.360]
See you so it took all of this time and now the porkers just discovered there's drugs in the bars on South Beach

[02:08:43.480 --> 02:08:45.880]
Oh my god better late than never I guess huh

[02:08:46.560 --> 02:08:50.660]
They could ask like a school kid somewhere and they could have told him that but oh they just discovered that

[02:08:50.660 --> 02:08:54.460]
Because they're right on top of it, baby and they're jealous because they weren't getting the good stuff

[02:08:54.460 --> 02:08:55.340]
That's what it's all about

[02:08:55.960 --> 02:09:00.080]
Here's a mobile in the Palm Beach hello. Hello. Yes, sir. Yeah. Yes

[02:09:00.080 --> 02:09:03.680]
I just wanted to address that guy that was talking about the panthers moving to as a Palm Beach

[02:09:03.680 --> 02:09:09.540]
Yeah, let me tell you something. There's a good year blimp right now flying all around West Palm Beach with big huge

[02:09:09.540 --> 02:09:12.560]
Panthers sign on the side. Uh-huh. Well, that proves it to me

[02:09:12.560 --> 02:09:17.420]
Oh, well, I think they're trying they're trying what trying to get everybody hyped up about them. I'm okay

[02:09:17.420 --> 02:09:22.140]
Ain't gonna happen now. I know I just I live closest up here. I wish they wish it would but anyway

[02:09:22.720 --> 02:09:24.680]
Uh, don't you meet your job and okay later

[02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:26.320]
hahaha

[02:09:27.040 --> 02:09:30.800]
Uh-huh, you know, it's something I take back what I said before we never want to lose their Palm Beach lines

[02:09:30.800 --> 02:09:33.300]
And don't take this personally unless you want to in which case i'd love it

[02:09:33.880 --> 02:09:36.960]
But uh, it's it's like since we don't have the Tampa stuff anymore

[02:09:36.960 --> 02:09:41.400]
We don't have those yahu's over in Tampa, St. Pete and this really is a shot because you're not even an air league

[02:09:41.400 --> 02:09:45.600]
But it's like a step away. See like this guy he means well, but he's stuck up there

[02:09:46.200 --> 02:09:49.180]
And there's nothing up there. I mean when I worked there 21 years ago

[02:09:49.180 --> 02:09:50.540]
WJ in 1975

[02:09:50.540 --> 02:09:52.980]
I've told you this many times you're tired of hearing it. I'll tell you again

[02:09:52.980 --> 02:09:54.560]
It was not bad. It was okay

[02:09:55.160 --> 02:10:00.060]
And that town has deteriorated and deteriorated and it's just like whatever sign of life that used to exist there

[02:10:00.060 --> 02:10:05.820]
It's basically gone and the city itself was Palm is like one festering toilet now and um

[02:10:06.360 --> 02:10:07.280]
Other than that it's okay

[02:10:07.760 --> 02:10:12.180]
And so they become like wannabe's another you know, well, they can't do it down here in Miami

[02:10:12.180 --> 02:10:14.900]
So we'll have it up and they're not gonna have it up there in other words

[02:10:14.900 --> 02:10:17.460]
We're pretty goddamned inept we're embarrassingly inept

[02:10:17.460 --> 02:10:22.020]
But I mean if we can't do it down here you really think people are gonna come flocking in to Palm Beach

[02:10:22.020 --> 02:10:27.620]
Counting to see like a ballgame or a hockey you're dreaming it ain't gonna happen man. It ain't gonna happen

[02:10:28.740 --> 02:10:31.580]
But i'll tell you one thing not that I want to be selfish or anything like that

[02:10:31.580 --> 02:10:36.460]
But that site out there at the sawgrass you know like about a block in a half from my house sounds pretty god damn good to me

[02:10:36.460 --> 02:10:40.540]
So since Wayne is on a right track with all the other stuff why to hell not just one more time

[02:10:40.540 --> 02:10:44.180]
Start your day with the rick inside. I'll even make up. I don't say we didn't walk

[02:10:44.180 --> 02:10:45.500]
Kiss your ball. Come on. Come on.

[02:10:45.640 --> 02:10:48.680]
My name is Forte-Mallardale. Use talking entertainment radio

[02:10:49.300 --> 02:10:51.860]
610 W I O D

[02:10:51.860 --> 02:10:54.920]
Hey but heads it's a one to two hour

[02:10:58.400 --> 02:10:59.280]
Ha ha ha

[02:10:59.280 --> 02:11:03.500]
Miami has the dog food the greatest football team

[02:11:03.500 --> 02:11:05.500]
Oh

[02:11:18.980 --> 02:11:31.180]
Are you sure

[02:11:39.300 --> 02:11:40.020]
Oh

[02:11:54.420 --> 02:11:58.840]
Miami has the dog food the greatest football team

[02:11:58.840 --> 02:12:03.060]
We take the ball from full and go like no one's ever seen

[02:12:03.500 --> 02:12:07.440]
We're in the air we're on the ground we're always in control

[02:12:07.440 --> 02:12:07.760]
Oh

[02:12:11.500 --> 02:12:12.620]
Because we're the

[02:12:22.380 --> 02:12:26.840]
It's just about a facial lady

[02:12:27.720 --> 02:12:31.800]
He's in the back he's in the slack he's in the air he's in control he's got that hair for

[02:12:34.700 --> 02:12:35.440]
You wanted

[02:12:36.720 --> 02:12:38.720]
Now you got here we got yes

[02:12:38.720 --> 02:12:39.580]
We

[02:12:44.700 --> 02:12:47.180]
107 at W I D all I do think it's a

[02:12:48.360 --> 02:12:49.240]
Sad said

[02:12:51.520 --> 02:12:55.220]
When announcement of this magnitude has to be pushed back a half an hour because

[02:12:55.220 --> 02:12:56.740]
Bubba's gonna be speaking in four

[02:12:56.740 --> 02:13:02.400]
Bubba's holding a news conference in four so we got to push back the official announcing a Jimmy sign in the four thirty

[02:13:02.920 --> 02:13:06.240]
Which I think shows you just how screwed up this country's priorities really are

[02:13:06.240 --> 02:13:11.300]
We have an open line and Broward five two four nine four six three five two four W I O D

[02:13:11.300 --> 02:13:12.980]
Join our very very

[02:13:12.980 --> 02:13:14.720]
Mediocre party we're having here today

[02:13:14.720 --> 02:13:18.200]
I sat down to 10 I thought it was gonna be just a tremendous explosion of enthusiasm

[02:13:18.200 --> 02:13:23.140]
And then of course when I found out the default was talking wrestling and boxing last night for two hours

[02:13:23.140 --> 02:13:26.940]
And when fat Hank was on her trying to make it with some a washed out babe with big hooters

[02:13:26.940 --> 02:13:30.220]
Now we understand what it's really all about there is no enthusiasm here

[02:13:30.220 --> 02:13:32.140]
It continues to be big in the bush

[02:13:33.380 --> 02:13:40.320]
Here's highly on the purple line. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. I am a Julio. I am from highly and I'm an educated football fan. All right

[02:13:40.320 --> 02:13:47.180]
And I'm gay so hey there. Oh my god. There's the first honest caller. We've had this month

[02:13:47.980 --> 02:13:52.080]
And I am definitely gonna be roasting a pig today in honor of Jimmy Johnson

[02:13:52.080 --> 02:13:57.640]
All right, the man is great and thank God I can finally enjoy the game

[02:13:57.640 --> 02:14:01.200]
I think you just gave us all a good idea. Let's heat up the pork today in honor of Jimmy

[02:14:01.200 --> 02:14:06.520]
Yeah, I also got I got an observation though. Yes, you know, everybody likes Jimmy Johnson. Why is that? Oh, he's Southern

[02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:11.640]
Hey, he's a big talker. He can fill up a stadium and he's got the hair. He's just like Elvis. There you go

[02:14:12.020 --> 02:14:15.460]
He is like Elvis in fact, you know something. He may be the reincarnation of Elvis

[02:14:15.460 --> 02:14:18.780]
That's what I was thinking the same thing you never know everybody loves everybody loves Jimmy

[02:14:18.780 --> 02:14:21.780]
Hey, there's always sightings of him everywhere right there you go

[02:14:21.780 --> 02:14:24.360]
Well, there's your first gay Julio color, huh? All right

[02:14:24.360 --> 02:14:27.740]
I have a nice date and back to you. Put you up sweetheart. See you

[02:14:28.120 --> 02:14:28.920]
How do you like that?

[02:14:29.720 --> 02:14:34.200]
Another fag Julio, but this one's honest. He's the only honest one we got. Oh well about three or four others

[02:14:34.680 --> 02:14:38.820]
There's no reason to be hiding in a closet just because Mama Sita's gonna be all upset and you know that

[02:14:38.820 --> 02:14:41.120]
That muddy cone thing. They're all gonna be calling your names

[02:14:41.120 --> 02:14:43.420]
But hey, you can call it back at him because you know that they are too

[02:14:43.420 --> 02:14:49.000]
Papa Sita would be really upset because it makes him less macho, but he's too busy with his boyfriend. You don't got time to worry about him

[02:14:50.120 --> 02:14:55.320]
We have an open line with his boyfriend and his girlfriend with the big ass or is it the wife that's no the wife's got the big ass

[02:14:55.320 --> 02:14:57.840]
The girlfriend's got the big hooters. I'm sorry. I keep getting that confused

[02:14:58.540 --> 02:15:03.720]
We have an open line on the purple line and that's for anybody that's got like 18 T wireless and mobile one cellular

[02:15:03.720 --> 02:15:06.680]
That's what it's for anybody that's got a cell phone it works for free now

[02:15:06.680 --> 02:15:11.500]
I guess you don't know that do you because you've been kind of shut out for like a year now for over a year

[02:15:11.500 --> 02:15:12.380]
They've been shut out

[02:15:12.800 --> 02:15:16.360]
Thanks to those far-bison to go in with that BS phone service. They've been shut out

[02:15:16.920 --> 02:15:21.200]
Pound IOD it works. How do you like that pick it up and give it a shot? It works. What a miracle, huh?

[02:15:21.200 --> 02:15:22.240]
Oh and Merakle

[02:15:22.980 --> 02:15:27.580]
Una whatever that means. I don't know that stuff. I don't know from no spick. Here's Miami Lake. Hello

[02:15:27.980 --> 02:15:34.400]
Hello, Neon. Yes. How are you today? I'm doing very well so far a long time listener first time caller wonderful

[02:15:34.400 --> 02:15:38.960]
I was over there this morning at the station and you signed the inside of flap of my best of seats

[02:15:38.960 --> 02:15:42.400]
I signed your flap and it was a very enjoyable experience. Yeah, I wanted to thank you for that

[02:15:42.400 --> 02:15:45.560]
I heard you rip me oh somebody ripping D for earlier

[02:15:46.440 --> 02:15:49.640]
I heard that people's gonna be hosting the weekend show on Saturday. Right

[02:15:50.660 --> 02:15:54.020]
That's his punishment. That's his punishment. I

[02:15:54.020 --> 02:15:55.080]
I figured maybe they could find like a

[02:15:55.080 --> 02:15:58.800]
A full-time weekend guy instead of having him on Saturday and

[02:15:59.280 --> 02:16:00.220]
Nickel on Sunday

[02:16:00.680 --> 02:16:05.160]
Is Nickel gonna be on Sunday or that? Oh no the no this is oh this is the best part of the deal

[02:16:05.160 --> 02:16:07.460]
Wait till you hear this which the audience doesn't know about yet

[02:16:08.140 --> 02:16:10.620]
The the new morning news guy, okay

[02:16:11.280 --> 02:16:14.280]
From West Palm Beach. Yeah, he's not coming

[02:16:14.920 --> 02:16:18.860]
He was gonna be anchoring the Sunday morning weekend magazine and

[02:16:18.860 --> 02:16:21.820]
He ain't coming and he's not showing up either

[02:16:22.800 --> 02:16:26.580]
So you're right nickel bag is gonna continue doing Sunday mornings until they can find some

[02:16:26.580 --> 02:16:31.060]
Some some clown to come in here actually I heard you stay from him because while I was waiting in the lobby for the

[02:16:31.060 --> 02:16:35.240]
City to come back out. I heard him say that deeper was gonna be on Saturday and he'd still be here on

[02:16:36.200 --> 02:16:42.180]
On Sunday. Oh my god. Well, that'll give you good reason to sleep in late Sundays or just go somewhere else and

[02:16:42.560 --> 02:16:46.040]
Leave it on FM maybe or just turn over to Waxi and listen to the plant guy

[02:16:47.040 --> 02:16:51.740]
Well, listen Neil. I got a statement request for you. See if you could play the Dave game song Dave game

[02:16:52.480 --> 02:16:54.560]

Open line and date 75 with you know this is a computer start to give me really really pissed off

[02:17:02.920 --> 02:17:05.860]

That's why it's in Miami because it's push league is Mickey Mouse

[02:17:13.280 --> 02:17:16.260]
To settle the thing if you want to see that

[02:17:24.080 --> 02:17:24.100]

[02:17:46.160 --> 02:17:48.720]
He's a traveler with the hitch.

[02:17:48.760 --> 02:17:52.200]
He's quite the size of that rich Dave Gain.

[02:17:55.200 --> 02:17:59.820]
And with all of that dirt, he really shakes the earth.

[02:18:00.460 --> 02:18:03.220]
Dave Gain is son of a bitch.

[02:18:04.700 --> 02:18:08.120]
That is fat and just that's in her name.

[02:18:08.920 --> 02:18:10.400]
Dave Gain.

[02:18:10.900 --> 02:18:12.360]
This is Diet of Organ.

[02:18:12.600 --> 02:18:14.960]
We're taking you out to a special report from Dave Gain.

[02:18:15.120 --> 02:18:16.340]
All you can eat, Buck's A's.

[02:18:16.480 --> 02:18:17.900]

[02:18:18.360 --> 02:18:19.200]
Thank you, Diet of.

[02:18:19.640 --> 02:18:21.160]
We're here at the local supermarket.

[02:18:21.920 --> 02:18:22.980]
And they've gone undercover.

[02:18:23.400 --> 02:18:24.680]
Uh, Dave, undercover?

[02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:26.060]
That's right, undercover.

[02:18:26.840 --> 02:18:29.460]
I'm approaching the All You Can Eat Salabar for the seventh time.

[02:18:29.860 --> 02:18:31.420]
Sir, don't you think you've had enough?

[02:18:31.720 --> 02:18:33.000]
I thought this was a buffet.

[02:18:33.360 --> 02:18:34.660]
Yeah, but...

[02:18:34.660 --> 02:18:35.800]
Yeah, but nothing.

[02:18:35.800 --> 02:18:36.960]
You're a hunter.

[02:18:37.680 --> 02:18:42.360]
You want to see huge, dirty, sick section you, Dave Gain.

[02:18:45.580 --> 02:18:47.980]
Yeah, he can't beat wide.

[02:18:48.520 --> 02:18:51.780]
He's even bigger than Jeff Harding's Dave Gain.

[02:18:53.780 --> 02:18:58.840]
I couldn't look at fast, he'd surpassed with no slides.

[02:18:59.800 --> 02:19:00.620]
Dave Gain.

[02:19:01.800 --> 02:19:02.560]
Okay, that's it.

[02:19:02.560 --> 02:19:03.740]
You beat almost everything.

[02:19:03.740 --> 02:19:04.960]
Wait a minute. Let's go.

[02:19:05.060 --> 02:19:06.160]
I have none. I have none.

[02:19:07.080 --> 02:19:07.880]
I'm not drunk.

[02:19:08.380 --> 02:19:09.780]
I'll call out soon, John.

[02:19:11.780 --> 02:19:12.580]
Shade, shade.

[02:19:13.140 --> 02:19:14.120]
Shade, love you.

[02:19:15.580 --> 02:19:16.440]
What's 13 and 21?

[02:19:16.860 --> 02:19:19.040]
He's waiting with the auction to donate tonight.

[02:19:19.040 --> 02:19:19.800]
You might have gotten nervous.

[02:19:19.940 --> 02:19:21.120]
But anyway, the word is...

[02:19:21.120 --> 02:19:22.880]
This is serial, which you don't believe it probably.

[02:19:23.020 --> 02:19:25.420]
But it's real. Dave Gain is no longer on camera.

[02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:27.540]
He is the computer guy now.

[02:19:27.540 --> 02:19:31.820]
He's like sitting on a computer, which is why they can't get any news through it on the channel 4, which used to be channel.

[02:19:32.120 --> 02:19:33.440]
Seriously, they take it them off the ear.

[02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:35.600]
So we ought to give him a second chance.

[02:19:36.020 --> 02:19:37.320]
113 at WIOD.

[02:19:37.860 --> 02:19:39.580]
My name is Harvey Wyerman.

[02:19:39.740 --> 02:19:41.960]
I'm an attorney at Law and Tamarack, Florida.

[02:19:42.560 --> 02:19:49.500]
I listen to the Phil Hendry show because I haven't been able to wheel myself over to the radio to turn to another state.

[02:19:49.820 --> 02:19:51.420]
I can't get over to the radio.

[02:19:52.160 --> 02:19:52.920]
Phil Hendry.

[02:19:53.040 --> 02:19:53.780]
Oh, I can't.

[02:19:53.780 --> 02:19:56.500]
I'm 226 PM on News Talk and Entertainment Radio.

[02:19:56.540 --> 02:19:56.920]
No way.

[02:19:57.080 --> 02:19:58.800]
610 WIOD.

[02:19:59.340 --> 02:20:02.200]
Get down on your hands and ease and lick my boot.

[02:20:02.400 --> 02:20:02.580]
No.

[02:20:05.540 --> 02:20:06.140]
No.

[02:20:06.880 --> 02:20:07.160]
No.

[02:20:08.560 --> 02:20:10.340]
Are you so funny?

[02:20:10.900 --> 02:20:11.200]
No.

[02:20:11.920 --> 02:20:12.320]
No.

[02:20:16.540 --> 02:20:17.140]
Please.

[02:20:19.940 --> 02:20:24.860]
Don't put out this trick.

[02:20:26.740 --> 02:20:32.900]
It's a piece of crap to me.

[02:20:33.700 --> 02:20:39.100]
Can hardly hear my words.

[02:20:39.100 --> 02:21:08.460]
I can't get over to the radio.

[02:21:08.460 --> 02:21:08.460]

[02:21:08.460 --> 02:21:08.460]

[02:21:08.460 --> 02:21:08.460]

[02:21:08.460 --> 02:21:08.460]

[02:21:08.460 --> 02:21:08.460]

[02:21:08.460 --> 02:21:08.620]
I can't get over to the radio.

[02:21:08.620 --> 02:21:12.480]
So please.

[02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:18.120]
This song is a tear.

[02:21:20.680 --> 02:21:23.640]
I'm not going to trap me.

[02:21:24.020 --> 02:21:25.740]
Will believe.

[02:21:27.020 --> 02:21:27.420]
No.

[02:21:27.420 --> 02:21:32.880]
There should not be a hair.

[02:21:34.100 --> 02:21:36.660]
I can't be bothered.

[02:21:39.140 --> 02:21:39.460]
No.

[02:21:42.880 --> 02:21:42.880]

[02:21:46.280 --> 02:21:48.660]
Turned out like a piece of crap.

[02:22:01.920 --> 02:22:03.880]
This is the way it was to make shows.

[02:22:04.140 --> 02:22:04.900]
I can tell you that.

[02:22:05.160 --> 02:22:06.520]
2018 at WIOD.

[02:22:06.780 --> 02:22:07.360]
Here's Kendall.

[02:22:08.060 --> 02:22:08.960]
Hey, Neil.

[02:22:09.920 --> 02:22:12.260]
Hey, today is a great day, my friend.

[02:22:12.660 --> 02:22:13.400]
I thought so.

[02:22:13.800 --> 02:22:17.160]
I can only help.

[02:22:21.800 --> 02:22:23.760]
I don't think they're even jumping on yet.

[02:22:24.200 --> 02:22:25.240]
They wanted it.

[02:22:25.320 --> 02:22:25.960]
They wanted it.

[02:22:26.200 --> 02:22:27.300]
Now they got it.

[02:22:27.900 --> 02:22:29.580]
We're not sure we wanted it.

[02:22:29.800 --> 02:22:31.540]
How come we're picking on Neil Don?

[02:22:31.840 --> 02:22:33.280]
That's typical Miami.

[02:22:33.860 --> 02:22:34.680]
We want Jimmy.

[02:22:35.560 --> 02:22:36.040]
We don't.

[02:22:36.200 --> 02:22:39.120]
We want a baseball team.

[02:22:39.120 --> 02:22:40.260]
But now we don't.

[02:22:40.340 --> 02:22:43.000]
Only if they win world championships in the first couple of years.

[02:22:43.160 --> 02:22:43.340]
Right.

[02:22:43.840 --> 02:22:47.160]
How come the Panthers lost a couple of games on his trip and thank God they're leaving?

[02:22:47.640 --> 02:22:50.780]
Well, I called you last week because I'm that a free agent packer fan.

[02:22:51.820 --> 02:22:54.980]
I still have that option with that team if Jimmy doesn't pan out.

[02:22:56.720 --> 02:22:58.580]
You're keeping your options open, right?

[02:22:58.760 --> 02:22:59.580]
There you go.

[02:22:59.800 --> 02:23:01.120]
I have a question for you about Wayne.

[02:23:01.600 --> 02:23:03.780]
He wants a free stadium.

[02:23:04.140 --> 02:23:05.180]
All the gate receipts.

[02:23:05.180 --> 02:23:06.280]
All the concessions.

[02:23:06.640 --> 02:23:10.340]
All the parking plus TV and merchandising and all that.

[02:23:10.440 --> 02:23:10.640]
Right.

[02:23:11.520 --> 02:23:13.280]
And he expects to get that.

[02:23:13.280 --> 02:23:14.600]
I mean, is he going to get that somewhere?

[02:23:15.560 --> 02:23:15.920]
No.

[02:23:16.800 --> 02:23:18.620]
Are other owners getting that anywhere?

[02:23:20.100 --> 02:23:20.560]
No.

[02:23:20.820 --> 02:23:21.280]
I don't know.

[02:23:21.920 --> 02:23:22.980]
He's going to sell them.

[02:23:22.980 --> 02:23:23.420]
They're gone.

[02:23:23.560 --> 02:23:24.380]
They're going to Nashville.

[02:23:24.720 --> 02:23:29.780]
But I mean, is that just really outrageous or an outrageous?

[02:23:29.780 --> 02:23:33.360]
Don't you understand the deal is it's like the Jimmy Johnson thing.

[02:23:33.780 --> 02:23:36.940]
There's a whole, you know, the caller that called in before I gave me short

[02:23:36.940 --> 02:23:40.600]
trip because I was riding a high on the with this euphoric Jimmy is here thing.

[02:23:40.740 --> 02:23:42.140]
But I think he had a good point.

[02:23:42.500 --> 02:23:46.120]
The way this thing has been orchestrated, you know, the public was teased and taunted.

[02:23:46.660 --> 02:23:47.720]
Do we want Jimmy?

[02:23:47.940 --> 02:23:49.100]
Do we want to don to retire?

[02:23:49.660 --> 02:23:52.860]
Greeter things are going to, you know, greener pastures are on the other side with Jimmy.

[02:23:53.420 --> 02:23:57.640]
And it kind of is a real good cover up and a smoke screen just at the time when probably

[02:23:57.640 --> 02:24:00.300]
in about three weeks they're going to announce the Panthers are being sold in Nashville

[02:24:00.300 --> 02:24:01.660]
because you people won't build me an arena.

[02:24:01.980 --> 02:24:05.220]
But look at what a good guy I am because I brought Jimmy Johnson in and this is so much

[02:24:05.220 --> 02:24:06.060]
more important anyway.

[02:24:06.320 --> 02:24:06.580]
I guess.

[02:24:06.680 --> 02:24:07.360]
Does that make sense?

[02:24:07.560 --> 02:24:08.640]
I think the guy was right.

[02:24:08.820 --> 02:24:10.220]
Looking for somebody to pat him on the back.

[02:24:10.320 --> 02:24:10.500]
Right.

[02:24:11.180 --> 02:24:13.020]
Hey, can you make fun of some blind people?

[02:24:13.320 --> 02:24:13.320]

[02:24:13.320 --> 02:24:14.820]
Because my girlfriend's blind and I love her.

[02:24:15.320 --> 02:24:15.520]
No.

[02:24:16.140 --> 02:24:16.920]
Have a great day, pal.

[02:24:18.040 --> 02:24:18.360]
Oh.

[02:24:19.340 --> 02:24:20.080]
We have an open line.

[02:24:20.820 --> 02:24:22.100]
We have an open line in day.

[02:24:22.280 --> 02:24:23.100]
It's 751.

[02:24:23.260 --> 02:24:23.760]
Do you hear that?

[02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:25.540]
Can I make fun of some blind people?

[02:24:25.540 --> 02:24:27.560]
Can you see your way clear to doing that?

[02:24:27.860 --> 02:24:28.760]
That's bad, man.

[02:24:28.940 --> 02:24:29.560]
That's really bad.

[02:24:30.660 --> 02:24:35.400]
We got a blind abort that works here named Mike and quite frankly, he'd probably be

[02:24:35.400 --> 02:24:39.060]
better in management because our management, well, that's another story.

[02:24:39.720 --> 02:24:41.400]
121 at WYOD, George.

[02:24:42.520 --> 02:24:44.340]
It takes a mens warehouse sale.

[02:24:44.440 --> 02:24:45.700]
But I'm doing a read of mens warehouse.

[02:24:46.160 --> 02:24:47.620]
See, I knew it would work.

[02:24:48.340 --> 02:24:51.000]
I knew it would work for you are so easy.

[02:24:51.200 --> 02:24:52.900]
You're so, I'm embarrassed.

[02:24:52.900 --> 02:24:55.240]
I'm embarrassed for you that you're so easy.

[02:24:56.100 --> 02:24:57.020]
I wasn't even looking.

[02:24:57.180 --> 02:24:57.880]
And there you go.

[02:24:58.620 --> 02:25:00.960]
That's probably, well, what do you say about the blind people?

[02:25:01.360 --> 02:25:03.080]
Like I said, we got this blind board off of you.

[02:25:03.200 --> 02:25:06.080]
I think it's hard to think, see?

[02:25:08.560 --> 02:25:11.780]
I'm the type of guy with a big square head.

[02:25:12.200 --> 02:25:15.740]
I went on my fights except the ones that did.

[02:25:16.300 --> 02:25:22.000]
Yes, I'm the type of guy who pounded Michael Spinks and showed him that he's yours.

[02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:27.820]
And if the boxing really stinks, I'm the type of guy who always is alert.

[02:25:28.740 --> 02:25:32.040]
I show Carl Williams that the truth can really hurt.

[02:25:32.580 --> 02:25:36.000]
You're the type of guy that thinks that I'm a bum.

[02:25:36.580 --> 02:25:43.680]
So I just say to you that you are D-U-M-E dumb, I'm the type of guy with my weaving and

[02:25:43.680 --> 02:25:44.500]
my bobbin.

[02:25:44.960 --> 02:25:48.460]
I only lost one fight and the picture's name was Robin.

[02:25:48.460 --> 02:25:56.460]
I'm the type of guy who makes the people laugh and put the man down in a minute and a half.

[02:25:57.320 --> 02:26:04.060]
I'm the type of guy who makes the people stare just because I keep all my cash and don't

[02:26:04.060 --> 02:26:04.740]
keep his hair.

[02:26:05.120 --> 02:26:08.800]
I'm the type of guy and the public just attack me.

[02:26:09.060 --> 02:26:12.740]
And if you don't believe it, then you had better ask me.

[02:26:13.220 --> 02:26:14.460]
I'm the type of guy.

[02:26:14.640 --> 02:26:16.000]
That's what I'm hitting in the world.

[02:26:17.340 --> 02:26:18.560]
I'm the type of guy.

[02:26:19.220 --> 02:26:21.040]
Robin, give him some ground to keep your butt.

[02:26:21.320 --> 02:26:22.600]
Yes, I'm the type of guy.

[02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:24.300]
Next fight comes to my face.

[02:26:24.560 --> 02:26:26.700]
I'm the type of guy.

[02:26:27.080 --> 02:26:27.680]
Don't miss on me.

[02:26:27.840 --> 02:26:28.780]
I'm the type of guy.

[02:26:29.060 --> 02:26:29.060]

[02:26:30.940 --> 02:26:31.660]
What's 2060W?

[02:26:31.820 --> 02:26:32.860]
Can you explain something to me?

[02:26:33.520 --> 02:26:37.040]
Why is it that they have to have another trial for Nick on the young and a horny when the

[02:26:37.040 --> 02:26:41.000]
perpetrator of the shooting, the rapie in the case Amy has already come forward and said

[02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:41.740]
that she did the shooting?

[02:26:41.860 --> 02:26:43.040]
What do they have to have another trial for?

[02:26:43.420 --> 02:26:44.580]
Because that's the way it is.

[02:26:44.580 --> 02:26:47.080]
Because they have to drag it out for another two months.

[02:26:48.080 --> 02:26:52.220]
And because we have to have more confrontations with the warmen who this time will have a better

[02:26:52.220 --> 02:26:53.520]
shiver or something like that.

[02:26:54.320 --> 02:26:57.040]
We have an open line on the board just one and look at where it is.

[02:26:57.200 --> 02:26:59.940]
It's on a purple line which we opened up for the whole world now and that's sitting there

[02:26:59.940 --> 02:27:02.880]
dead which is really very depressing at pound I.O.D.

[02:27:03.600 --> 02:27:04.680]
But anyway in the meantime.

[02:27:05.680 --> 02:27:11.240]
I am me had done sure of but now he's his story.

[02:27:11.620 --> 02:27:11.740]
Yes.

[02:27:12.120 --> 02:27:21.240]
But now we have Jimmy Johnson and that's okay by me but we still have Cox and Cossar

[02:27:21.240 --> 02:27:23.460]
and Dan's Titanic lips.

[02:27:23.840 --> 02:27:24.080]
No.

[02:27:24.240 --> 02:27:26.640]
And their sister Mary Mendes.

[02:27:26.840 --> 02:27:27.020]
Yes.

[02:27:27.020 --> 02:27:29.940]
That's another new ass tulip.

[02:27:30.440 --> 02:27:32.780]
It's the same.

[02:27:33.220 --> 02:27:35.000]
I am a dolphin.

[02:27:35.720 --> 02:27:35.980]
No.

[02:27:36.240 --> 02:27:38.040]
I am a dolphin.

[02:27:38.580 --> 02:27:38.840]
No.

[02:27:39.100 --> 02:27:40.260]
I am a dolphin.

[02:27:40.480 --> 02:27:41.860]
It's MJJ.

[02:27:42.760 --> 02:27:43.480]
Yes.

[02:27:43.680 --> 02:27:46.260]
It's just the same I am a dolphin.

[02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:47.180]
No.

[02:27:47.560 --> 02:27:49.440]
I am a dolphin.

[02:27:49.740 --> 02:27:49.880]
No.

[02:27:50.400 --> 02:27:51.860]
I am a dolphin.

[02:27:52.100 --> 02:27:55.260]
It's no way they...

[02:27:58.180 --> 02:27:58.580]
Oh.

[02:27:58.760 --> 02:28:00.400]
I like that little hum job there on the end.

[02:28:01.380 --> 02:28:03.460]
128 must be almost time for the Hummer to come on.

[02:28:03.560 --> 02:28:06.460]
So we can talk about Playboy Bunnies or something like that.

[02:28:06.760 --> 02:28:07.900]
How's that bunny Barbara doing?

[02:28:08.060 --> 02:28:11.900]
How's Jim Gallant doing and at other asshole I used to be Mike Abernathy?

[02:28:12.860 --> 02:28:13.340]
Oh boy.

[02:28:13.520 --> 02:28:14.820]
We could go through all those great stories.

[02:28:14.940 --> 02:28:17.980]
They could tell you some lyric Kings stories those two guys but I'm sure somebody probably

[02:28:17.980 --> 02:28:19.120]
would just assume keeping quiet.

[02:28:19.200 --> 02:28:19.320]
No.

[02:28:19.500 --> 02:28:19.680]
Yes.

[02:28:20.840 --> 02:28:21.960]
Here's Fort Lauderdale.

[02:28:22.040 --> 02:28:22.260]
Hello.

[02:28:23.640 --> 02:28:24.440]
Fort Lauderdale.

[02:28:24.620 --> 02:28:24.860]
Hello.

[02:28:24.860 --> 02:28:25.700]
Yes sir.

[02:28:26.500 --> 02:28:27.020]
Neil.

[02:28:27.320 --> 02:28:27.580]
Yes.

[02:28:27.980 --> 02:28:29.580]
First time call a long time listener.

[02:28:29.820 --> 02:28:30.120]
Okay.

[02:28:30.540 --> 02:28:35.040]
I know you like the ponies and I've got little ponies story for you.

[02:28:35.500 --> 02:28:36.940]
A racing story.

[02:28:37.720 --> 02:28:40.500]
If I've if you've heard it just tell me enough stuff.

[02:28:40.660 --> 02:28:41.300]
What it's a joke?

[02:28:42.020 --> 02:28:42.800]
It's a story.

[02:28:43.080 --> 02:28:43.320]
Yeah.

[02:28:43.660 --> 02:28:48.320]
Okay we have an open line in Broward 5249463524WYOD.

[02:28:48.920 --> 02:28:49.780]
Here's Boca.

[02:28:50.300 --> 02:28:50.480]
Hello.

[02:28:51.400 --> 02:28:51.480]
JJ.

[02:28:53.500 --> 02:28:56.060]
You blew the brain stem out.

[02:28:56.200 --> 02:29:02.180]
The poor old man he would never admit that his coaching skills started to suck.

[02:29:03.440 --> 02:29:04.040]
JJ.

[02:29:09.300 --> 02:29:10.740]
They can't always be great.

[02:29:10.760 --> 02:29:12.000]
He usually has some pretty good stuff.

[02:29:12.100 --> 02:29:13.080]
You know who that was don't you?

[02:29:13.800 --> 02:29:14.560]
You know who that was George?

[02:29:15.440 --> 02:29:16.040]
George?

[02:29:16.280 --> 02:29:16.440]
Yes.

[02:29:18.580 --> 02:29:20.000]
I'm pretty sure it's this guy.

[02:29:22.840 --> 02:29:23.240]
Isn't it?

[02:29:23.240 --> 02:29:24.180]
Isn't it?

[02:29:24.680 --> 02:29:25.260]
It's not?

[02:29:25.760 --> 02:29:26.720]
No this guy was good.

[02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:27.340]
You're wrong.

[02:29:28.560 --> 02:29:28.960]
Okay.

[02:29:29.420 --> 02:29:30.280]
That's what it is.

[02:29:31.020 --> 02:29:32.040]
What would he use for that?

[02:29:33.500 --> 02:29:35.820]
Maybe some of these stories guitar this is Miami.

[02:29:36.540 --> 02:29:37.140]
This is good.

[02:29:37.580 --> 02:29:38.000]
Another bit of something.

[02:29:38.560 --> 02:29:41.840]
Oh this is the guy who I said they can't always be good in this city.

[02:29:42.480 --> 02:29:43.960]
Which they can always be good sometimes.

[02:29:45.480 --> 02:29:48.280]
You're all so glad away.

[02:29:48.320 --> 02:29:56.160]
Oh baby, instead of driving around the freeway, you should have been on Brazilian airway.

[02:29:56.880 --> 02:30:01.320]
Oh your friends call you the juice.

[02:30:02.580 --> 02:30:07.760]

[02:33:43.260 --> 02:34:05.720]
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[02:34:10.300 --> 02:34:35.700]
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[02:34:40.420 --> 02:35:04.680]
I love it when you run to play that goes like negative five yards and he just gives Stevens a look right they always show it but I think that the unimaginative offense in the NFL maybe Jimmy's got to picture on Gary Stevens and maybe he's gonna like whip him into shape you know what I'm saying I don't know after 10 years you really think that maybe he's gonna be calling the shots maybe he's just gonna be calling the shots and Gary's gonna be a gofer Gary's gonna bring him take out from pizza loft well he said the reason

[02:35:04.680 --> 02:35:34.660]
she wouldn't get rid of those people because they all did what he said he didn't want to have to bring anybody else in and train him yeah so maybe Steven maybe that was of course don't forget I mean that's just the the story but it's not a done deal at Steven's a stain that's what everybody is saying but that's you know that's up to Jim ah she's I'd love to see him go by I would pack him a several sandwiches back to college go play for East Tennessee girl school game in all right we'll enclose maybe the city though huh maybe the city that would be good yeah having all girls team up there you know girls in terminal badminton or something but in closing not

[02:35:34.660 --> 02:36:04.640]
everybody from games though is a redneck tough guy okay all right see ya bye just most we have an open line at day 751 W I O D we got one in Brad we still got one there on the Green Line in Palm Beach where you can't even shock them into their sensibilities you can't shake them out of their lethgy it's hopeless because we said we don't want to go up there to see no hockey games and guess what we won't under any circumstances get that through your head right now we are not coming okay we're not coming to Palm Beach for love or money we're also not coming up there to my near park I know that comes as a great shock to some of you but I'm not sure if you're gonna be able to do that I'm not sure if you're gonna be able to do that I'm not sure if you're gonna be able to do that I'm not sure if you're gonna be able to do that I'm not sure if you're gonna be able to do that I'm not sure if you're gonna be able to

[02:36:04.640 --> 02:36:15.860]
but hey don't take it personal it's business it's just too far to come up there and sit and watch those lovely people at myzner park open line and the Green Line near 1 800 it's ringing now as we speak

[02:36:36.420 --> 02:36:52.820]
it's coming there destruction panic in the street it's the apocalyptic music event of the summer it's the grateful dare in concert and if you make it out alive you'll be grateful too it's the be grateful you're not dead to starring the grateful dare a bunch of fat middle-aged men playing psychic

[02:36:52.820 --> 02:37:02.640]
Elegrat songs about peace and love while a new generation of angry young fans who totally missed the point right in the parking lot because they're pissed off at the boomers for taking all the good stuff

[02:37:02.640 --> 02:37:10.240]
ultimately forcing local authorities to cancel the show to prevent further injuries and loss of life it's the be grateful you're not dead to or coming soon to

[02:37:10.240 --> 02:37:14.980]
event you near to you the laxable bexiting still available okay so she's laughing and there I happen to like

[02:37:14.980 --> 02:37:19.140]
brigams yeah those of you go into the all-star game in Boston you want a great Italian meal don't get sucked into

[02:37:19.140 --> 02:37:23.560]
going to the north end in Boston they do have some good Italian restaurants up there but many of them are highly

[02:37:23.560 --> 02:37:28.260]
overrated and there's so many of them you won't pick the really good one probably unless you're lucky go to a place called

[02:37:28.260 --> 02:37:36.960]
Milano's on Newberry Street man in the back pay it is so good I'm telling you Milano's it is just in Cray Blay and you know if

[02:37:36.960 --> 02:37:42.720]
you're on a diet though don't go there they give you just a normal a normal portions and you start talking like

[02:37:42.720 --> 02:37:48.520]
this because your mouth is full of something here's Miami hello hello yes sir

[02:37:48.520 --> 02:37:55.540]
no yes I think the reason why a lot of people haven't been reacting why aren't they reacting well I feel that they're smart

[02:37:55.540 --> 02:38:00.920]
they're not jumping the gun what does that mean well I'm not jumping a gun for you

[02:38:00.920 --> 02:38:05.420]
who hasn't proven nothing here in Miami you might have proved it in Dallas no but this is what they wanted though

[02:38:05.420 --> 02:38:10.140]
don't you understand other words if this came as a surprise if this was like out of left field and they had to

[02:38:10.140 --> 02:38:14.220]
like kind of analyze it but this is what they've been screaming and shouting they've been going to the games with big

[02:38:14.220 --> 02:38:19.740]
bags over their head and the science saying we want JJ you know this has been a cause 11 is town for months now

[02:38:20.500 --> 02:38:28.840]
well has it not or I just dreamed of yeah that's right they they belly they belly ache well that's my point they belly

[02:38:28.840 --> 02:38:32.960]
ache and carry on you know we don't like this give us something else and then when you give it to him it's like well I don't

[02:38:32.960 --> 02:38:38.360]
know if I really want this after it's like a little kid with a toy you know I think what it is they want to be popular with the crowd

[02:38:38.360 --> 02:38:44.220]
oh is that it I think that's what it is right they so they so all that they saw all the emoting with the Tony

[02:38:44.220 --> 02:38:48.340]
cigaretteo and Jimmy syphilis now they want to like have that morning period they don't want to react you

[02:38:48.340 --> 02:38:55.440]
know overreact and piss off the dawn it's disrespectful you know well I know is I got my tickets all

[02:38:55.440 --> 02:38:59.120]
lined up for next season that if they don't want to you know it'll make for a more parking room for the

[02:38:59.120 --> 02:39:06.280]
rest of us screw that I've always liked Don Chula and everything but I knew there was time for change

[02:39:06.280 --> 02:39:10.600]
that's right it's not it's not personal it's business can't they understand it's not personal it's

[02:39:10.600 --> 02:39:19.060]
business that's all right but you know not to say in his hey days he was a great coach I mean as far as

[02:39:19.060 --> 02:39:24.620]
I'm concerned he was an offensive wizard yeah I mean he was the only guy to beat the bears that year I

[02:39:24.620 --> 02:39:29.900]
mean we didn't exactly have a great deal but I mean well that's something to remember that we meet the

[02:39:29.900 --> 02:39:35.240]
bears on a Monday night during the hour one and fifty fifteen and one season right so how long do you

[02:39:35.240 --> 02:39:40.440]
think it's gonna take for Jimmy Johnson to get something going down two years two years yeah I'm

[02:39:40.440 --> 02:39:45.780]
not saying super bowl in two years but two years before we really have a dynamite contending playoff

[02:39:45.780 --> 02:39:52.000]
uh... ass kicking team well I mean you can't expect it overnight and if he no seriously if these

[02:39:52.000 --> 02:39:55.780]
people are going to be impatient and they're going to expect like fourteen and two the first season

[02:39:55.780 --> 02:40:00.840]
and a super bowl of appearance I think that they're going to have expectations that are unrealistic well

[02:40:00.840 --> 02:40:06.020]
I mean even though people are looking to go to the super bowl he did bring him to the playoffs

[02:40:06.020 --> 02:40:11.280]
if he championship last year at brim to the playoffs this year so at

[02:40:13.080 --> 02:40:18.220]
well why they they they they backed in they backed into the playoffs this year thanks to Oakland

[02:40:18.220 --> 02:40:21.880]
blowing a big lead and thanks to the fact that Atlanta gave us a game and didn't kick that field

[02:40:21.880 --> 02:40:25.680]
goal and when they did go to the playoffs they got him embarrassed and humiliated so bad that even

[02:40:25.680 --> 02:40:31.140]
he was hanging his head like a dog well don't let's not try to rewrite history okay it's uh... it's

[02:40:31.140 --> 02:40:34.960]
pretty clear what the pan you just got through saying so yourself and how you try to talk yourself out

[02:40:34.960 --> 02:40:40.600]
of it but not really okay well you think about it for a while we have an open line and date seven

[02:40:40.600 --> 02:40:44.220]
five well you see they're not really sure in other words it's like I said like a kid with a toy

[02:40:44.220 --> 02:40:49.080]
or it's like it's like people going to a restaurant and they look over the menu and they say okay

[02:40:49.080 --> 02:40:53.160]
this sounds really good I'm gonna order this and they put the order in with the waiter and as they're

[02:40:53.160 --> 02:40:57.500]
sitting there talking and having their uh... to eighteen martinis they look over at the table next to

[02:40:57.500 --> 02:41:01.580]
them and the people next to them who got their you know a little bit sooner their entree is being

[02:41:01.580 --> 02:41:06.620]
served and they look at the plate on the table they said you know that other things sounded really good

[02:41:06.620 --> 02:41:14.180]
but that looks incredible you know what i'm saying so it's like well we wanted this but maybe that's

[02:41:14.180 --> 02:41:19.400]
uh... yeah right okay whatever you want whatever you say i can't change here's Miami hello

[02:41:20.040 --> 02:41:20.480]
good

[02:41:21.000 --> 02:41:21.620]
going to

spring training facilities yes i'm very excited about that yes

[02:41:42.420 --> 02:41:46.740]

[02:41:46.740 --> 02:41:51.540]
well i'm happy for you uh... we don't want to talk about boring stuff like baseball today pal okay

[02:41:51.540 --> 02:41:54.500]
there's an old fart see that's the only kind of people that care about baseball anymore is old

[02:41:54.500 --> 02:41:58.220]
farts like him that like the guy that asked me about the bob tourle you think even that guy don't

[02:41:58.220 --> 02:42:02.580]
care about baseball he just wants to make some cash from bob's old balls we have an open line in

[02:42:02.580 --> 02:42:07.200]
brown or five two four nine four six three five two four w i would be and who knows maybe bob's old balls

[02:42:07.200 --> 02:42:13.220]
or worth something these days uh the old bullet bob guy all the way to his age i kind of down it

[02:42:13.220 --> 02:42:20.660]
here's point and beach hello how fat is the hummer how fat is the hummer can you weigh him on a scale

[02:42:20.660 --> 02:42:27.440]
can you ship him through the mail how fat is the hummer hi Neil yeah uh being a seasoned ticket holder

[02:42:27.440 --> 02:42:32.040]
i do feel so what's all this big uh scoop that i you had the other day that we're still waiting

[02:42:32.040 --> 02:42:37.660]
to hear about what you probably made up uh... that what it's already happened oh okay no but

[02:42:37.660 --> 02:42:43.040]
actually story i feel trying to program the show again no i would i would have to avoid the folks

[02:42:43.040 --> 02:42:49.060]
see now i tried to be anonymous yeah right you try to be anonymous right this is the first real call

[02:42:49.060 --> 02:42:53.820]
in about a year just like jacke lee calling in and try to be anonymous i don't even compare me to that

[02:42:54.220 --> 02:43:00.000]
now i feel reborn uh i feel it's the second coming of the franchise i would get season tickets no matter

[02:43:00.000 --> 02:43:04.160]
whether jimmy was here now just make sure they're not in your mind no i'm in the end though

[02:43:04.160 --> 02:43:10.760]
i'll come see you oh yeah no but the the biggest difference that i'm looking for now is past rush

[02:43:11.360 --> 02:43:14.380]
i mean we're not going to see quarterback like mike tom's act

[02:43:14.380 --> 02:43:20.020]
steve wall boomer size and those are the orange yeah they're not going to write novels in the back

[02:43:20.020 --> 02:43:24.800]
field like jim kelly in the playoff game standing back there with five minutes to uh pick out an

[02:43:24.800 --> 02:43:30.100]
open receiver and pick his nose oh ridiculous and how come man which has been telling everybody

[02:43:30.100 --> 02:43:34.200]
the past three or four years oh you don't have to have a pass rush to uh you know be a real playoff

[02:43:34.200 --> 02:43:38.380]
contender and be a winning team this man for a guy that played the as many games as he didn't took

[02:43:38.380 --> 02:43:42.560]

[02:48:17.920 --> 02:48:23.240]
through the lunch boxes and taking out all the drinks with the kids even after the school said

[02:48:23.240 --> 02:48:27.700]
absolutely no way take any money to the arena what does Wayne have to do with that

[02:48:27.700 --> 02:48:34.840]
wasn't right uh Wayne's brother-in-law a part owner of the arena well yeah but i don't think that they

[02:48:34.840 --> 02:48:39.780]
uh well maybe they do i don't know the Gestapo of course Wayne i think yeah Gestapo got out there

[02:48:39.780 --> 02:48:44.000]

[02:48:52.000 --> 02:48:55.960]
hey sorry it's part of the arena's policy well didn't hear the music when he went into the circus

[02:48:57.740 --> 02:49:01.380]
that should have given you a little warning right off the bat that's what i told her yeah that's

[02:49:01.380 --> 02:49:06.160]
what i told her and she says uh they were taken all the five year old drinks out of their lunch boxes

[02:49:06.160 --> 02:49:11.060]
so they can't drink so they'd have to buy drinks and all the school said absolutely no money

[02:50:27.080 --> 02:50:32.620]
here's an orth Miami hello hi Neil yes sir a couple of years ago i read an in-depth article on

[02:50:32.620 --> 02:50:36.620]
Jimmy Johnson and the herald and a couple of facts from that article that kind of explain his

[02:50:36.620 --> 02:50:42.820]
success yes one is that he has a a doctorate in psychology from i think was university at Texas

[02:50:42.820 --> 02:50:48.940]
and his dissertation was in the area of motivational psychology which kind of explains how he can

[02:50:48.940 --> 02:50:55.180]
motivate people so effectively and the second point was he has an IQ of 170 oh my god which puts

[02:50:55.180 --> 02:50:59.620]
him in the top 10 to the top 1 percent which is like more than the collective IQ of the entire

[02:50:59.620 --> 02:51:04.120]
dolphin football squad which means he's up on a level probably with marv Levy if not smarter oh my

[02:51:04.120 --> 02:51:07.780]
god i that would be surprised if he has a little jewel in him somewhere even with a name like

[02:51:07.880 --> 02:51:13.420]
well possibly but that kind of explains his great success in motivating teams to national

[02:51:13.420 --> 02:51:17.000]
championship yeah that's what it's all about these people don't understand that they just they

[02:51:17.000 --> 02:51:21.760]
look at statistics they look at numbers on a page they listen to these so-called expert jocks on

[02:51:21.760 --> 02:51:26.620]
ear they don't understand what being a being a leader is all about marv Levy took a bunch of

[02:51:26.620 --> 02:51:30.460]
daughtering old clowns up there in buffalo and the pound of the crap out of the dolphins and got

[02:51:30.460 --> 02:51:34.060]

[02:51:53.460 --> 02:51:58.600]

[02:51:58.600 --> 02:52:03.280]

[02:52:03.280 --> 02:52:07.720]
me i'm negative that i'm too much of a sour poised that i'm whatever because you love that that's

[02:52:07.720 --> 02:52:11.240]
why you listen to this show even though it is the worst show in uh... in america make no mistake

[02:52:11.240 --> 02:52:17.100]
about that that's what you listen for hostility and hysteria and uh... whatever but definitely don't

[02:52:17.100 --> 02:52:22.100]
be positive and enthusiastic about something because uh... i mean seriously this is really this is

[02:52:22.100 --> 02:52:26.920]
