[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.640]
What's the subsession with Hoki?

[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000]
Oh

[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.440]
Come again

[00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.040]
This is

[00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.560]
Black

[00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.520]
Hey

[00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.520]

[00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.900]
another

[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.500]
Me.

[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.400]
Unbelievable located.

[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.980]
And it�s a high in the year

[00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:06.600]
by Terry Kirkner in the center.

[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:10.120]
And now the panthers getting

[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:11.780]
across Strudland kicked it ahead

[00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.280]
right onto the stick of Zubat.

[00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.140]
Zubat giving goals he hits the

[00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.480]
Florida line.

[00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.480]
Check from behind by Strudland

[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.900]
Panthers will turn Strudland's

[00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.180]
loose and here's my cup three on

[00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.260]
one.

[00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.200]
It's from high up to scores.

[00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.000]
My cup has opened the scoring

[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.680]
for Florida.

[00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.740]
24 seconds to go.

[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.680]
He hits the streaking

[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.260]
going up to eyes.

[00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.900]
Where verrみ back from Florida.

[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.440]
Top Fitzgerald over the line.

[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:03.280]
Stores!

[00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.180]
Top Fitzgerald and the Panthers are back in front.

[00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:08.360]
Oh!

[00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.820]
Three minutes to play in the third.

[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:16.580]
Yager to Mirana.

[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.700]
She has been going to the net.

[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.940]
Park comes out in front.

[00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:21.780]
And Bill Lindsay starts back.

[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:23.900]
Here's a two on one for Florida.

[00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:25.520]
Lindsay over the line.

[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:26.380]
Passes across.

[00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.940]
Please go over.

[00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.580]
You're ahead, Garpen-Law, it's three, one.

[00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:33.180]
Panthers.

[00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:36.020]
Unbelievable.

[00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.480]
Ayame Yager said before the playoffs started this season.

[00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.920]
He said, oh, he said, I really hate the playoffs because it

[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.640]
is so hard to play offensive hockey.

[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.140]
It's so much more fun during the regular season.

[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:50.040]
Oh, boy.

[00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.960]
Have the Panthers ever made that a true is a mirror in this

[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:53.340]
series.

[00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.380]
They've held this team down.

[00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.800]
It'll be just above 2.3 goals a game in the series.

[00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.300]
Settering pass in, but shot to flex it.

[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:02.960]
Backhander and Vs.

[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.760]
Brogdon Yager talked it away on the fire side.

[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.120]
Subok holding it in.

[00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.240]
Countdown underway and flak it.

[00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.460]
Set up right your team season.

[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.280]
They are going to stand in the finals.

[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.680]
As the Panthers have beaten Pittsburgh, three to one.

[00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:18.980]
Ah!

[00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:20.400]
Yes!

[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:22.160]
Yes!

[00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:22.480]
Yes!

[00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.100]
So anyway, anybody nervous out there at all Saturday like me

[00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.000]
having a heart attack, having a major heart attack.

[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.280]
I'm taking my blood pressure.

[00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:32.300]
I'm pacing the floor.

[00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.960]
I'm getting on my hands and knees, which I guess I'm used to.

[00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:36.640]
I'm just having a nervous breakdown, man.

[00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.760]
Holy crap.

[00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.520]
So if all agree, by the way, Channel 7 next door, you guys

[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:42.220]
did a great job.

[00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.520]
Of course, the fact that they got the Fox telecast on here

[00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:45.480]
might have something to do with it.

[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.780]
But boy, they're on top of this med like Rick Sanchez on that map.

[00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:50.380]
They are squatting on it.

[00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:52.320]
They are right on top of it.

[00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:53.080]
They're all over it.

[00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.820]
And of all the clips of Wayne Heizinger,

[00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:55.960]
did anybody see the one?

[00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.420]
You must have seen it where he just, he just like a kid,

[00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:00.280]
just lost it.

[00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.820]
He was right next to Scroodland there after the game.

[00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.700]
And he's like, this is just, and he puts his head like over

[00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:08.060]
on Scroodland's shoulder.

[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:09.520]
And he goes, ah!

[00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:11.320]
Oh my God.

[00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.960]
At a boy, Wayne, that's what I said.

[00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.460]
Ah!

[00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.000]
When it was finally all over.

[00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:16.900]
Thank God.

[00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:18.800]
Thank the Lord, Halle, Looia.

[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.860]
So it's great to see all the reals.

[00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:24.520]
And by the way, Kimba Bull Camp, where I got playing to say

[00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:27.480]
about you, you pusshead, you piece of walking turd.

[00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:29.320]
Jesus, God almighty.

[00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.320]
You know, these guys that are all on a bad wagon.

[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.360]
Now, the fans, we got room for everybody.

[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:34.380]
And I've said that all along.

[00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:37.360]
But for some dumb Jack, that's another story.

[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.240]
And that's what we got in this town pretending to be sports

[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.300]
casters are a bunch of dumb Jacks.

[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.020]
That's what we got, including Kimba.

[00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.260]
Oh, yeah, I heard your crap Saturday morning.

[00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.320]
I was unlucky enough to be in the car when he's going through

[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:53.140]
that thing about, wow, these people belly-ickened about all the

[00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:54.560]
empty seats through the regular seat.

[00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.580]
See, I hate to break the news to you, Kimba.

[00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:58.840]
I don't mind about, like I said, all the fans

[00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:01.260]
jumping on a bad wagon because this expands the fanbase

[00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:02.720]
of the best thing that we got in this town.

[00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:03.180]
That's great.

[00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:07.120]
But all you media people, so-called broadcasters and writers

[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.640]
and you're a list who have shined us all year long,

[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.560]
who didn't have even one Iota of interest

[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.360]
in hockey or the Panthers or anything, I say screw you guys.

[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:16.580]
Okay, like who are you fooling?

[00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:19.140]
Like Zagaki and the Hummer over there who's still saying,

[00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:21.220]
oh, welcome, we're talking about hockey.

[00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:24.720]
Yeah, and as far as the man witch and all these other

[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.400]
and vote-jangles, dumb Jack.

[00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:27.200]
That's where it's at.

[00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.360]
So we'll be talking to the coach a little bit later on.

[00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.360]
I'm going to give him some instructions.

[00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:32.160]
You know, he's no seriously.

[00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:33.740]
It's good to have a good pupil like that.

[00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:36.360]
The teacher and the student, he's an excellent student, Doug.

[00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:40.060]
Listen to me, you know, right on target and then we'll execute

[00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:42.920]
the same way in Colorado against the Lanch.

[00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:45.800]
That's got to be the worst nickname in all sports history

[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:46.680]
as the avalanche.

[00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:47.580]
Everybody knows it.

[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.260]
First they start calling the Aves and that sounded like crap.

[00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:53.360]
And now they're just the Lanch, even the name of its sucks.

[00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:57.700]

Well, no, it's 0.999 pure silver.

[00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:26.600]
In other words, it's pretty damn pure.

[00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:31.860]

Ah!

[00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:27.380]
Henry, 2-60M on News Talk and Entertainment Radio.

[00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:29.520]
6-10-W-I-O-D.

[00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:33.440]
Ah!

[00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:35.880]
Ah!

[00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:36.220]

[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:37.960]
There's a buzz on the street.

[00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:40.220]
I just can't get in town.

[00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:41.420]
Ah!

[00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:41.700]
Saturday night!

[00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:42.680]
Ah!

[00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:54.620]
10-17-W-I-O-D.

[00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:57.220]
Will be pleased and proud to know that almost the entire

[00:09:57.220 --> 00:10:00.120]
Canada country, the entire or whatever it is up there,

[00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:03.300]
Yahoo! Canucks have embraced the Panthers man.

[00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:04.360]
They love the underdog.

[00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:05.340]
They love the Panthers.

[00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:07.400]
We got a lot of Canadians on this team, a lot of Canucks.

[00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:10.020]
And the only place where it will be the exception is

[00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:12.560]
in Quebec, which who wants the frogs anyway, because the

[00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:15.120]
Quebec Nordic are now the Colorado Avalanche.

[00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:18.580]
So some of those Patrick, Wah, and Claude Lemieux fans will be

[00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:19.440]
rooting for the Avalanche.

[00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:19.860]
And that's good.

[00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:21.200]
Who wants them anyway, like I said.

[00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:22.140]
Did I just say that?

[00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:24.900]
I'm wound up like a goddamn snare drum.

[00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:26.040]
That's how tight I am today.

[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:28.580]
I thought I was having a heart attack for sure on Saturday.

[00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:30.120]
I'm pacing the floor.

[00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:31.180]
I'm like just...

[00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:33.220]
Seriously, it's as close as I thought in my life,

[00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:34.800]
ever to come and have a heart attack.

[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:36.580]
I just thought I'm never going to survive this.

[00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:37.640]
And I did.

[00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.140]
So what's going to be like the next seven games?

[00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:41.600]
Although I don't think it's going to be seven.

[00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:42.800]
I think we can beat them in six.

[00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:44.180]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:44.560]
Hello.

[00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:45.500]
Neil, good morning.

[00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:46.160]
Win is Diaz.

[00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:48.760]
Thank you very much for letting me be number one to say,

[00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:50.460]
God, these Panthers are incredible.

[00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:51.300]
Isn't it amazing?

[00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:52.160]
It's just...

[00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:53.800]
I got a pinch every part of my body.

[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:55.460]
I did exactly what you said, Neil.

[00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:58.400]
I have a nice big 35-inch Mr. Bishy with my nice,

[00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:00.720]
big 10, perfect 10 satellite dish.

[00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:02.760]
I was two inches away from that screen.

[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:03.040]
Yep.

[00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:05.040]
Even my wife sat in watch to form me.

[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:05.560]
She kept saying,

[00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:06.340]
how can they do that?

[00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:07.180]
He can't do that.

[00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:09.000]
He's never seen a game before.

[00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:09.360]

[00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:11.460]
And she's going ballistic.

[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:12.940]
It's incredible.

[00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:15.080]
I don't think we'll be getting no punks from Pittsburgh

[00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:15.900]
calling in today.

[00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:17.620]
Say, oh, gee, who won the game last night?

[00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:18.440]
Like, we're down on the Friday.

[00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:20.100]
I think we'll be getting out of that crap.

[00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:21.220]
Where's Scooby-Doo now?

[00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:21.720]
Right.

[00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:22.400]
He's watching.

[00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:24.200]
Did you notice toward the end of the game there,

[00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:25.440]
they were playing Dooby-Doo?

[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:25.660]
Right.

[00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:28.020]
And it was almost sarcastic there in Pittsburgh.

[00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:29.920]
But Neil, I mean, it's just...

[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:31.180]
Let me ask you one thing.

[00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:33.200]
I mean, what's the young kids that we have?

[00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:34.620]
Do you have any fears?

[00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:35.260]
Any ask?

[00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:37.520]
McLean, this is more than a bout quad Lemieux.

[00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:38.840]
Meaning what?

[00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:40.660]
Meaning the guys are total asshole.

[00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:42.620]
And with some of the, you know, the young kids,

[00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:44.520]
I mean, look what he did to Draper, you know?

[00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:44.700]
Yeah.

[00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:47.280]
At first of all, he's not going to be playing these first two games.

[00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:49.980]
That's the number one, which it should be a lot more than that, by the way.

[00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:50.540]
It should be the whole series.

[00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:53.100]
And a general manager that frog with the avalanche saying,

[00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:55.400]
oh, he's really disappointed and can't believe this is suspension.

[00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:57.360]
What del game was he watching that Detroit game?

[00:11:57.920 --> 00:11:59.160]
But no, I'm not worried about that.

[00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:00.160]
They've kept their cool.

[00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:01.140]
They've kept their poise.

[00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:02.980]
They haven't been sucked into a lot of stupid penalties.

[00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:04.140]
And I'm not worried about it at all.

[00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:07.280]
And, you know, I just hope that he doesn't decide to take off

[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:08.400]
on what our guys like that.

[00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:11.080]
Neil, I have to, if he does, let him go hit one of the ugly guys.

[00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:13.360]
I dug up some of my old tapes and I can still remember

[00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:16.520]
when we first were given the team and we were talking about the name.

[00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:18.700]
And somebody first told you about the panthers.

[00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:19.860]
You're sitting there going panthers.

[00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:20.140]
Yeah.

[00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:20.780]
Great.

[00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:21.700]
Has the sound now?

[00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:23.240]
Sounds a lot better now.

[00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:23.900]
It sure does.

[00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:25.140]
Well, it sounds better than avalanche.

[00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:26.500]
I'll tell you that.

[00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:27.220]
It sure does.

[00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:29.720]
Well, Neil, God bless you, the panthers,

[00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:31.360]
and my satellite dish and the CBC.

[00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:33.060]
And let's go, guy.

[00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:33.500]
All right.

[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:34.020]
Take care.

[00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:37.440]
So, anyway, what happened to that thing?

[00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:38.720]
Unbelievable.

[00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:39.500]
Oh, there it is.

[00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:43.240]
We have an open line at day 7519-463-751.

[00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:44.880]
This entire town is rocking.

[00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:48.380]
They were selling t-shirts and underwear and memorabilia

[00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:50.120]
and stuff that hasn't been in Vetter yesterday.

[00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:51.860]
They couldn't print it up fast enough.

[00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:54.260]
So everybody's making big bucks off of this.

[00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:57.660]
And Wayne and Marty Heisenger running around like a bunch of teenagers now.

[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.880]
And, yeah, I hope everybody saw that one clip when he went.

[00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:02.380]
It was beautiful.

[00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:03.620]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:04.040]
Hello.

[00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:05.180]
Good morning, Neil.

[00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:05.520]
Yes, sir.

[00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:06.120]
Buenos to you.

[00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:09.340]
Just the most unbelievable game that I've ever seen.

[00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:12.000]
I didn't think anything to keep the sixth game.

[00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:14.800]
But when it came down to where he scored that third goal,

[00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:16.960]
and you just knew that this was it that they were in.

[00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:20.100]
Yeah, you had that feeling when it kind of went up over Barrazo's shoulder

[00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:21.560]
and back behind his ass.

[00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:23.160]
And, yeah, it was beautiful.

[00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:26.000]
I mean, I had my towel wrapped so tight around my fingers.

[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.180]
I just about cut my damn fingers off.

[00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:28.460]
Yeah.

[00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:31.640]
But I want to remind the fans about something.

[00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:34.600]
Your colleague Rick is the guy that used to cut people off.

[00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:36.380]
Anytime they wanted to talk hockey and say,

[00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:38.240]
he used to tell them call Neil.

[00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:40.440]
Yeah, he's another late comeer, late bloomer.

[00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:40.740]
Yeah.

[00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:42.620]
And I get in the car this morning.

[00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:45.000]
The first thing I heard him doing with Plano's hockey highlights,

[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.380]
I just about drove off the road.

[00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:49.380]
A late spy report about Fat Hank.

[00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:49.800]
Yeah.

[00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:51.740]
In the Philadelphia series.

[00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:56.060]
Just before game six, it was the Monday before you came back on the air.

[00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:59.620]
He was doing an on air interview with script.

[00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:01.780]
And he was telling screw.

[00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:03.080]
No, no, I heard I heard that.

[00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:04.380]
I just got out of it.

[00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:05.420]
I only had the four minute.

[00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:06.200]
Right.

[00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:10.060]
That was the most embarrassing interview I ever heard in my life.

[00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:11.960]
He didn't have any idea what he was talking about.

[00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:14.840]
And it was scrambling that got the double minor for Slasian Brindabor.

[00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:16.860]
He didn't have any clue what he was talking about.

[00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:17.300]
Exactly.

[00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:20.120]
And there's our prime sportscaster.

[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:20.600]
Yeah, right.

[00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:21.860]
Good luck to us, Neil.

[00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:22.460]
Okay, pal.

[00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:23.040]
Bye.

[00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:26.180]
Yeah, there's a guy that really knows his stuff that fat hums there.

[00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:28.340]
Yeah, can we stop talking about this?

[00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:29.920]
I mean, we're just in the styling cup finals.

[00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:31.400]
Yeah, we're just in the finals.

[00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:32.840]
Can't we stop talking about it already?

[00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:33.300]
Right.

[00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:35.760]
We'll stop talking about it when we're ready to stop.

[00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:37.080]
Which ain't going to be for a long time.

[00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:37.520]
Okay?

[00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:39.800]
Because this town is buzzing finally.

[00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:41.520]
They finally cut out of the good stuff.

[00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:45.060]
And all you lazy slabs out there in the media who've been too lazy to like come to,

[00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:48.040]
you know, more than a couple of games and learn something about it too bad.

[00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:50.220]
Because now you're like way back down the road.

[00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:53.040]
We can look back over our shoulder and you're like 10 miles behind.

[00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:55.680]
Now, what does this say?

[00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:58.620]
This is from Mike Brophy, my good friend there with the,

[00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:01.020]
my good personal friend, hockey news in the Sanbury.

[00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:02.500]
I didn't give us any credit at all.

[00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:02.860]
There he is.

[00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:04.020]
He's got like six teams listed.

[00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:06.520]
They give us any, don't put Mike Brophy on here.

[00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:07.720]
He's okay.

[00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:09.360]
He's not a bad guy, but he's full of crap.

[00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:10.120]
This is Mike Brophy.

[00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:11.500]
See you right here with the hockey news.

[00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:14.080]
They don't come any better than Neil Roger.

[00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:15.840]
Like I said, Mike Brophy knows his stuff.

[00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:17.660]
It's 1022 at WIOD.

[00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:19.520]
So let's talk some more hockey,

[00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:21.600]
D-Full, Rubin and Hyde.

[00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:23.640]
Thursday nights live from Dave and Busters,

[00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:25.480]
I-95 and Sterling Rogue.

[00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:27.540]
Vips the sports writers on the radio,

[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.700]
with their eyes, ears, hands, and microphones focused on the Panthers.

[00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:33.540]
The sports writers on the radio,

[00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:36.520]
60-M Thursday live from Dave and Busters,

[00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:38.720]
on news, talk, and entertainment radio.

[00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:42.140]
610-W-I-O-D.

[00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:44.020]
What's the succession with Hokey?

[00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:45.120]
Oh, it's Wednesday, cleanly.

[00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:46.220]
Four, tens at a cross.

[00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:49.020]
Shot by Chanel, blocked by Jodie Hall.

[00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:50.140]
He's held up. Here's Lindsey.

[00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:51.400]
Lindsey working on board.

[00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:55.320]
Got down with Jodie Hall in front of Lindsey's car.

[00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:56.600]

[00:15:56.980 --> 00:15:58.960]
The Lee Palo, Lee and Phil Lindsey,

[00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:02.240]
for the Panthers back in front of the Panthers,

[00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:05.740]
the Tink of the Lee and their score 57 left to go.

[00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:09.620]
Yeah.

[00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:12.140]
So anyway, it's 1025 at WIOD.

[00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:14.000]
I want to let that little extra bleep on air for air.

[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.600]
Now is that really from Denver Discoller? Is this a joke? Hello?

[00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:18.300]
This is really from Denver, Colorado.

[00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:18.960]
Unbelievable.

[00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:20.300]
Good morning, Neil.

[00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:21.040]
Yes, sir.

[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:22.600]
I miss you so damn much.

[00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:23.300]
I bet.

[00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:26.680]
Panthers are awesome.

[00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:27.480]
Yes, they are.

[00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:29.820]
I went to a bar, a bar near the day,

[00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:31.740]
and they were showing the Rockies game,

[00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:33.400]
like the last inning, and I walked in,

[00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:35.960]
and I was like, can we watch the last half of the Panthers game?

[00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:36.280]
Yeah.

[00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:38.600]
Because it's kind of important, and they changed it for me.

[00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:39.160]
All right.

[00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:41.520]
And I was like the only person in there screaming,

[00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:43.000]
go, Panthers, it was awesome.

[00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:43.780]
Doesn't it?

[00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:46.720]
It's intense.

[00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:48.860]
Do you need any information at all?

[00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:50.640]
Do I need any information?

[00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:52.280]
Yeah, I work for US Air out here,

[00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:53.940]
and we're the ones that are running them back and forward.

[00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:54.540]
Yeah.

[00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:58.840]
Well, no, I guess they got there like at five o'clock

[00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:00.260]
in the morning on Sunday morning, right?

[00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:01.280]
No, nothing at all.

[00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:01.900]
At 115.

[00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:03.340]
Yeah, but I mean, our time.

[00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:04.960]
Oh, well, your time was at 315.

[00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:05.380]
Right.

[00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:06.880]
No, yeah, right.

[00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:07.340]
Whatever.

[00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:09.280]
Cool.

[00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:12.200]
And then they finally got some shut eye,

[00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:14.480]
and then they got up at noon, and they discovered

[00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:16.880]
that they were out of the hotel that they were supposed to be in,

[00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:18.600]
because the rooms were all sold out,

[00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:21.580]
and they had to schlep to another hotel, which is incredible.

[00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:22.240]
Nice.

[00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:23.720]
I don't know where they're standing on here, though.

[00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:25.300]
No, well, we don't want to let that word out.

[00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:27.360]
I'll be right over there.

[00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:29.640]
So if you got a big contingent coming in from here?

[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:31.460]
Unfortunately, no.

[00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:32.060]
No?

[00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:32.640]
No.

[00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:35.180]
Freaking nobody wants to come visit me, I guess.

[00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:37.820]
Oh, I can't believe that.

[00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:39.640]
I bet you people are making their plans today.

[00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:41.080]
I haven't called me yet.

[00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:42.100]
My phone hasn't rang yet.

[00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:45.020]
Like waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting.

[00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:46.780]
Well, maybe they're coming in on other airlines.

[00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:48.980]
I don't want to suggest that other airlines fly to Denver,

[00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:51.820]
like Delta and like that, but maybe that's what's happening.

[00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:53.280]
And I didn't like coming in, not at all, right?

[00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:54.040]
They're not?

[00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:55.160]
Right.

[00:17:55.580 --> 00:17:55.700]
Right.

[00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:57.380]
I know, I'm just kidding you.

[00:17:57.980 --> 00:18:01.420]
Well, I just, I had to call you, I mean, the Panthers are doing intense.

[00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:02.700]
Of course, I'm not there.

[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.240]
The town here is ape shot.

[00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:05.120]
I'll tell you that right now.

[00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:07.700]
Everybody in their brother is just, they're going nuts.

[00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:08.700]
I've missed the entire thing.

[00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:09.640]
I left in September.

[00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:10.080]
Yeah.

[00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:11.860]
And like, I'm here.

[00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:14.080]
I'm here in Colorado kind of sucks.

[00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:15.660]
And there's no humidity.

[00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:16.940]
And I want to go home.

[00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:19.300]
So you're going to get tickets to go see the games at least or not?

[00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:20.040]
I'm working.

[00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:22.240]
I'm going back to Florida on Thursday,

[00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:23.900]
because my sister's graduating from high school.

[00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:24.220]
Yeah.

[00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:27.360]
So like, I'm going to be working on Tuesday while they're playing the games.

[00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:29.060]
I'm going to get home deep out here.

[00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:29.560]
Yeah.

[00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:31.500]
I'm going to have some manager to pipe it through the whole store.

[00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:32.200]
There you go.

[00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:35.140]
They can play the Panthers games.

[00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:35.520]
Yeah.

[00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:36.480]
Can't ridiculous.

[00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:37.260]
Okay.

[00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:38.160]
Well, good luck to you, pal.

[00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:39.840]
I miss you a lot, Neil.

[00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:40.940]
You're God.

[00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:42.400]
Go Panthers.

[00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:42.800]
Okay.

[00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:45.440]
Oh, he was pretty boring.

[00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:47.720]
So anyway, no, it's probably a good thing he got out of here,

[00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:49.280]
because he was, you know, as soon as he left,

[00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:51.000]
we started good things happening here for us.

[00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:51.500]
He's all right.

[00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:52.440]
Just don't take it personal.

[00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:54.980]
Okay, let's go to Deerfield on the Purple Line.

[00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:55.260]
Hello.

[00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:56.180]
Yeah, Neil, how you doing?

[00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:56.680]
Great.

[00:18:57.020 --> 00:18:59.100]
Saturday night, the electricity was incredible.

[00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:02.480]
Right after the game, everybody was party and having a great time.

[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.020]
People were using the promo, the avalanche will fall.

[00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:08.140]
Yeah, like that.

[00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:09.180]
Yeah, not bad.

[00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:11.480]
And as far as ice cream.

[00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:14.300]
And by all, and I got to tell you this, because I know that most of you,

[00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:15.520]
oh, wait till you hear this.

[00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:17.940]
You know how I've been telling you the Stan Savrin,

[00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:20.040]
who does the sports beat show on KBL in Pittsburgh,

[00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:21.260]
hasn't given us any credit.

[00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:25.500]
So when the game was over, they had a 30 minute post game show,

[00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:27.340]
which I'm sure they thought was going to be their celebration.

[00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:28.700]
You know, their victory celebration.

[00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:30.540]
And it was like a wake.

[00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:34.700]
And Stan Savrin was still refusing to give us any credit.

[00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:37.060]
And he almost got into a fist fight with Guy Junker,

[00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:37.920]
who does the show with him.

[00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:40.020]
And the callers were like giving him a bunch of crap like geez.

[00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:42.380]
You got to give this panther team some credit, you know.

[00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:44.740]
And he just said, well, you know, it's the seven games.

[00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:46.100]
And I wish we had another seven games.

[00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:47.600]
I hate to break the news to you, Stan.

[00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:48.340]
And don't work that way.

[00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:50.100]
It's not a 14 game series at seven.

[00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:50.940]
You guys lost.

[00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:52.240]
He was brutal.

[00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:56.380]
Is there going to be anything with regard to a penalty imposed on the avalanche

[00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:58.760]
for what he did in the last game against Detroit?

[00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:00.120]
Who love you?

[00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:00.480]

[00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:03.300]
Well, when I, if you've been in a cocoon somewhere,

[00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:04.580]
he got suspended two games.

[00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:06.800]
No, I know that, but I'm saying someone said that he was going to be

[00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:09.660]
off a two minute penalty for what he did at the end.

[00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:12.820]
There's no, there's no carryover of penalties from one game to another.

[00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:14.900]
Okay, because I thought the media was saying.

[00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:16.740]
In fact, somebody on one of the things,

[00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:18.360]
because we got all these people talking about it,

[00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:19.320]
don't know what they're talking about.

[00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:22.300]
They said, well, they're going to be penalized for the next two games.

[00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:23.840]
So that sounded good to me, you know,

[00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:26.580]
they're like, they're going to be shorthanded for the entire two games.

[00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:28.840]
Yeah, he just gets suspended. That's their penalty.

[00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:30.020]
And it should be a lot more than two.

[00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:31.100]
It should be the whole series.

[00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:33.060]
It didn't know doubt about it because what he did was a...

[00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:33.660]
Rotesk.

[00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:34.840]
Yeah, is that...

[00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:36.660]
You think it's going to be, I mean, as physical,

[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.060]
I mean, the most physical of all the series so far.

[00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:41.100]
You're going to be real physical or a very physical team.

[00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:44.520]
Okay, because I know playing Philadelphia with regard to that series,

[00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:46.580]
Boston with that series, and now with Pittsburgh.

[00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:49.720]
In fact, that's the main reason that they knocked off Detroit

[00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:52.240]
is because Don Cherry has been talking about it a lot.

[00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:55.880]
Those five Russians on there on Detroit just like last year against New Jersey,

[00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:58.800]
once they start hitting the man, they all kind of turtle down around the ice

[00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:01.480]
and they take run for cover and they become very ineffective.

[00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:04.740]
But nobody's intimidated us all year and it's not going to happen now.

[00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:08.140]
This team reminds me so much, and I don't know if you'll agree with me of the island

[00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:09.840]
that they repeated four years in a row.

[00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:13.920]
A young aggressive team that doesn't take any crap from anybody.

[00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:15.480]
Yeah, but we don't have Denise Potphen.

[00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:17.300]
We do as a brunt.

[00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:20.240]
Yeah, that's it. Maybe he'll start taking credit for it now.

[00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:23.240]
Yeah, I think, no, Neil, you would need to take all the credit, man.

[00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:24.740]
You put this place on the map.

[00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:25.820]
You put this place on the map.

[00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:30.280]
And all I hear is the negative stuff from the meaty out the New Broward County arena

[00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:31.920]
which is going to be the best in the country.

[00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:35.400]
I think this O'Jellist that is coming into Broward that they have nothing better than the rest of the world.

[00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:39.160]
And I want you to keep in mind tomorrow is the final vote, okay?

[00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:43.420]
And I'm going to tell you on the day, on the day when we're going to be playing tomorrow night,

[00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:45.280]
the first game in the Stanley Cup finals,

[00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:49.600]
if any of those Broward commissioners has the balls to vote no, including John Rodstroman,

[00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:51.040]
they better run for cover.

[00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:55.140]
I think it's just a big game and all it is is just about technicalities that working out

[00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:58.960]
and they're just trying to make it look like they're doing an extra effort putting forward

[00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:01.500]
just to make everybody look good and the deal look sweet.

[00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:04.580]
They better walk in here tomorrow with a real happy look on their puts in.

[00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:06.660]
Everyone can get up at the same time and go,

[00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:07.260]
Yes!

[00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:09.140]
Yes!

[00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:10.920]
Or else.

[00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:14.820]
1996 will be incredible. We'll have the couple, have the arena in two years.

[00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:18.420]
I mean, this place is growing at leaps and bounds and thank you, Mr. Rodgers,

[00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:20.420]
let's look at it on the face of the map. And you're welcome.

[00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:22.540]
And you have a good one and go, Panthers!

[00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:25.960]
All right. We have an open line on a purple line, pound IOD.

[00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:29.180]
That's right, a lot of people out there, Joseph Gacky's out there in Denver,

[00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:32.480]
would have big silly look on his puts, like somebody put a lastick on his lips,

[00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:34.680]
like they're stretched from like one ear to the other one,

[00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:36.640]
and those big gigantic stupid eyebrows,

[00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:39.280]
and he's pretending like number one, he knows something about it,

[00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:40.600]
number two, he's enthused about it.

[00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:44.920]
Right, don't forget guys, whatever you do, don't take any hockey calls because it's boring.

[00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:50.020]
Atta boy, Joe! Atta boy, you really can sniff out something good when it's right there on your doorstep,

[00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:54.140]
can't you, Joe? You can really grab it when it's right there right in your fingertips.

[00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:56.060]
Here's the Gacky's sucks, okay?

[00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:57.400]
Here's Parkland, hello?

[00:22:57.960 --> 00:22:58.760]
No. Yes, sir.

[00:22:58.860 --> 00:22:59.820]
Hi, how's it going? Great.

[00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:04.280]
How much would you give? How much of your salary would you give up to have your name?

[00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:07.900]
The name, the phone number, and address of that asshole from Pittsburgh,

[00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:10.040]
who called you this week after game five?

[00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:10.800]
At least a buck.

[00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:11.760]
Unbelievable.

[00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:16.420]
You know something we can revel in the knowledge of knowing that that puts his hiding under his covers now.

[00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:20.740]
Sitting there crying in his beer, crying in his schnapps, looking out at his smoke stacks,

[00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:25.040]
getting ready for a 900 degree summer and a 20 below winter next year.

[00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:25.220]
Right.

[00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:28.200]
Go Panthers, you've done a lot to get everybody interested.

[00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:32.040]
I never was a hockey man before, I started getting involved for just standing cup playoffs,

[00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:32.780]
and now I love it.

[00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:34.060]
All right. So, let's go and take it all the way.

[00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:35.060]
Okay, pal. Have a good one.

[00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:37.140]
Thanks. Look what I just got here.

[00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:39.940]
I'll tell you one thing, I'm going to have to buy a new house.

[00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:42.940]
Look at that. Look at that.

[00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:44.060]
Here's another lithograph.

[00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:46.640]
This I'm sure is from our friends at Denise Potfans.

[00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:47.900]
I'm positive of that, right?

[00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:52.480]
This one don't have no note or no letter or no nothing on it, which I wish it did because.

[00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:55.180]
Oh, and look at that.

[00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:56.940]
It's number six 10 again on the back.

[00:23:57.060 --> 00:23:59.320]
You know how they give the certificate of authenticity on the back.

[00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:01.760]
And it's a number six 10 in the series.

[00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:08.600]
Stanley Cup 1996, and it's got the avalanche logo in the bottom left hand corner in the Panther logo in the bottom right.

[00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:12.260]
And it's just a beautiful beautiful thing.

[00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:14.720]
It's got the big thing of the cup and then a hockey player.

[00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:20.820]
And over it's just a great thing and the broken hockey stick and a big Stanley Cup puck.

[00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:22.280]
This is the best of mall.

[00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:26.580]
And then of course, once we win a Stanley Cup itself, then we'll have an even better one.

[00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:28.200]
So what's that number?

[00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:30.400]
I'm sure that if they want this, it's that same number.

[00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:35.020]
It's one 800 up your ass hat trick one 800 hat trick without the sea,

[00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:36.540]
a t t r i k.

[00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:40.700]
And I don't know how much this one is because there's no note or no nothing, but I thank you profusely.

[00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:43.380]
I assume it's from our friend Jeff over there at the knees pot band sports.

[00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:45.640]
And it's just another beautiful lithograph.

[00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:46.700]
Baby, you got to have it.

[00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:47.820]
You got to have every one of these.

[00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:55.120]
And we'll all have to have bigger houses so that we have a gigantic trophy room so we can hang all of our stuff in our placards and stuff so we can all be hung.

[00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:57.140]
1034 at WIOD.

[00:24:57.860 --> 00:25:01.960]
When you talk live on 610 WIOD, you'll be recorded.

[00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:05.060]
And we'll play the take back whenever we feel like it.

[00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:05.980]
Hank is God.

[00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:06.820]
I love Hank.

[00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:08.540]
I'm having a GFF air with Hank.

[00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:11.120]
1045 to go in the third period.

[00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:17.220]
Here's Yachter up to center Brad Lauer.

[00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:22.400]
While he's shooting played by Gord Murphy back out in Stracca.

[00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:23.520]
Let's look again.

[00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:25.180]
Great food by Stracca.

[00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:27.080]
Don't let you to Stracca!

[00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:27.920]
Stracca!

[00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:29.040]
Yes!

[00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:38.740]
Lemieux with six points in the series and 46 points in the playoffs.

[00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:44.980]
So he now trails Joe Sackett by a couple in that race.

[00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:52.180]
As he tries to join Sackett in the Adelaide,

[00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:54.220]
in the Stanley Cup Championship series,

[00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:56.460]
there's a three-but-one big-back storm!

[00:25:57.300 --> 00:25:57.720]
Yes!

[00:25:59.160 --> 00:25:59.620]
Yes!

[00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:01.240]
Oh!

[00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:10.540]
Netbed will take the faceoff for Pittsburgh against Brian Strudler.

[00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:19.240]
Lemieux poised in behind Netbed.

[00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:21.440]
But the Panthers win the drive.

[00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:22.960]
Fitzgerald gets it down.

[00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:26.100]
Siobab, Husslingab.

[00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:29.240]
Raise the verge to Daniel.

[00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:31.200]
He was hit by Hank.

[00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:35.600]
Now 20 seconds left to the panorons will have to hurry.

[00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:42.440]
Here's the shoot-in in Yachter's first one to it.

[00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:44.400]
I'll factor it back out.

[00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:50.960]
And this amazing story is going to continue.

[00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:54.480]
The third of Panthers' first game, seven.

[00:26:57.680 --> 00:26:59.280]
I'm going to start on this boom,

[00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:01.080]
and I'm going to wrap out it all year long.

[00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:11.320]
The second one is going to be the first one to win.

[00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:13.420]
Okay, 22-11 at WIOD.

[00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:15.580]
The town is pumped, by the way, if there's anybody out there

[00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:17.840]
that wants to make a lot of money in these next few days,

[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.340]
like with the rat people or any of the places

[00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:21.780]
that are selling all this different stuff,

[00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:24.640]
faxed to us because you'll probably never get through on a phone.

[00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:27.300]
Okay, the fax number is 758WIOD.

[00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:29.400]
758WIOD.

[00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:30.520]
So if you've got stuff to pedal,

[00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:31.680]
we're more than happy to sit here,

[00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:32.980]
give you a little plug, promote,

[00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:35.460]
because everybody in town should have some kind of paraphernalia.

[00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:37.220]
They should have a rat hanging out of their ass,

[00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:38.700]
or something on their windshield,

[00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:41.780]
everywhere they should be waving it and the stuff too.

[00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:43.940]
Here's Orlando. Hello.

[00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:44.940]
Hello?

[00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:45.560]
Yes, sir.

[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.980]
Hey, Neil, I wasn't not able to talk to you,

[00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:49.060]
but I'll talk to you anyway, I guess.

[00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:50.300]
Well, what you were on hold for?

[00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:52.080]
Just a little bit, because I'm in Orlando.

[00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:53.000]
I couldn't hear your show.

[00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:53.580]
Why not?

[00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:57.200]
Because there's no radio station up here that catches the signal.

[00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:59.080]
Because of the wind they blow in in the right direction there.

[00:27:59.460 --> 00:27:59.780]
Exactly, yeah.

[00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:01.900]
But I guess, some on the radio,

[00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:06.200]
I came up from my dad's house to watch the game on satellite

[00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:07.600]
to hear the CBC broadcast.

[00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:08.160]
It was awesome.

[00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:08.680]
Right.

[00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:09.700]
It was totally awesome.

[00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:11.960]
How'd you like when Don Cherry said that he's a Panther fan?

[00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:13.100]
He's pulled for the Panthers now.

[00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:13.880]
Yeah, yeah, you got it.

[00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:14.380]
I like that.

[00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:15.120]
Exactly.

[00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:18.480]
He was hinting around how he was going for the Panthers totally.

[00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:18.720]

[00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:21.260]
But it was amazing.

[00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:24.620]
I think they're going to kill the avalanche

[00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:26.680]
because their defense, Mario Lemieux,

[00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:29.900]
was talking about how the Panthers defense of the best he's ever played up against.

[00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:30.560]
You know something?

[00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:32.520]
Yesterday, he said he went beyond that.

[00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:35.840]
He said, this is the best team I've ever played against.

[00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:37.140]
Yeah, that's what we're talking about.

[00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:37.300]

[00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:38.480]
The best team he's ever played against.

[00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:38.520]

[00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:40.620]
First, he said, it's the best defensive team.

[00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:43.640]
Yesterday, he said, this is the best team I've ever played against.

[00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:46.940]
Well, I have to agree, because you watch all that.

[00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:52.780]
You watch their defense this year is better than the New Jersey Devils was last year.

[00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:56.340]
Yeah, but we don't have to play that kind of trap and clutch and grab, though.

[00:28:56.340 --> 00:28:59.420]
You know, we played tight defense, but at least we don't play that boring game.

[00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:02.460]
We tried playing that in the second period the other night almost back for it on us.

[00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:08.860]
Right. And for the sole bear fans, well, they lost game one and the first game of the...

[00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:09.740]
They're playing Utah?

[00:29:10.340 --> 00:29:11.020]
Yeah, Utah.

[00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:12.000]
Yeah, Utah.

[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.460]
I saw about two minutes of that last night.

[00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:15.660]
Yeah, they lost it over time, three to two.

[00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:16.080]
Geez.

[00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:17.280]
I'll tell you one thing.

[00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:19.680]
Alan Bester, formerly of the Maple Leafs, he made...

[00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:20.080]
I just...

[00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:22.000]
No, I'm actually watching about ten minutes of the first period.

[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:23.200]
He was incredible last night.

[00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:23.620]
Uh-huh.

[00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:24.960]
Yeah, he was awesome.

[00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:25.660]
Good goalie.

[00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:29.220]
Yeah, but if I can go back on hold, if that's possible, I'd love to hear you.

[00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:30.120]
Okay, for a little while.

[00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:30.840]
Okay, hang on.

[00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:33.520]
He's tying up one of our lines, but that's okay because it's a green line.

[00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:35.620]
And those people in Palm Beach, they won't be able to get through one.

[00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:36.360]
They're lined too bad.

[00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:37.760]
They deserve it.

[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:38.600]
Here's Miami.

[00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:38.980]
Hello.

[00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:40.200]
Hey, Neil Ryder.

[00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:40.720]
Yes, sir.

[00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:42.820]
Mr. Puckface.

[00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:43.520]
Uh-huh.

[00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:48.340]
Let's keep the basketball fans about hockey.

[00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:49.080]
Basketball.

[00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:49.840]
What the hell is that?

[00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:52.960]
Well, I mean, have you been to a heat game with the Chicago Bulls?

[00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:55.080]
I haven't been to a heat game period.

[00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:56.920]
Nor do I ever intend to go to one.

[00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:57.480]
You're lucky.

[00:29:57.800 --> 00:30:02.540]
I mean, when Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippin are here, the crowd cheers for the other team.

[00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:02.840]
Nice.

[00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:03.620]
All right.

[00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:07.680]
Can I like when the Marlins won nine in a row and they come out there the next day and they're

[00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:09.680]
booing Jeff Kona and really nice fans.

[00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:10.040]
Exactly.

[00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:12.480]
One thing about the Panther fans, we don't boo our own guys.

[00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:15.160]
We may get pissed off at him once in a while, but we don't boo him.

[00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:20.280]
After game six, we were outside waiting for Lemieux and Yager.

[00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:23.560]
And when they came out, nobody got their autographed.

[00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:23.660]
Yeah.

[00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:24.560]
We laughed.

[00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:25.140]
Really?

[00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:27.380]
We got under their skin.

[00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:29.120]
And that's why we love to say.

[00:30:29.420 --> 00:30:29.680]
OK.

[00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:30.460]
Go Panther.

[00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:30.980]
See a pal.

[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:32.180]
How's the heat doing, by the way?

[00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:33.160]
OK.

[00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:35.080]
We have an open line indeed.

[00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:40.020]
7519-463-751-WYOD.

[00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:43.940]
The TV stations were all over this thing like Stink on Rick Sanchez.

[00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:46.380]
I mean, it was a channel seven, like I said, in particular.

[00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:50.120]
Since they happen to be the beneficiary of being affiliated with Fox, they're going to have some of the games.

[00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:53.980]
I sure hope, not that I have to worry about it, because I'll be watching them all on CBC.

[00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:56.340]
Because now we get the entire number one crew.

[00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:58.940]
We get Bob Cole and Harry Neal doing a play by playing the color.

[00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:00.720]
We get Ron McClain and Don Cherry.

[00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:04.300]
And the number one crew in it for the finals, of course.

[00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:11.540]
But when Fox has some of these telecasts, I sure hope they're not planning on using that Fox tracks for the finals here.

[00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:15.880]
Because that would be an act of insulin, the likes of which we've never heard of.

[00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:16.860]
That's right.

[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.240]
So you Fox people ditch the crap.

[00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:25.160]
OK, don't try to take the Stanley Cup finals and turn some of these games into like a video game.

[00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:29.400]
OK, we have more than just two and three year old little punky kids watching the games now.

[00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:31.000]
So grow up and get a life.

[00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:34.120]
We don't want to see the puck sitting up there eight rows up in a crowd.

[00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:37.040]
Here's Fort Lauderdale. Hello.

[00:31:37.140 --> 00:31:37.580]
Hey Neal.

[00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:39.180]
Yes, sir. How you doing, sir?

[00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:39.920]
Fantastic.

[00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:42.740]
Man, it is electrifying, exciting and all the rest.

[00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:43.940]
My heart survived it.

[00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:45.260]
All I could say is Saturday night.

[00:31:45.260 --> 00:31:48.660]
I was going, yeah, it was unbelievable.

[00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:50.640]
Hey, listen, last Wednesday night.

[00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:53.080]
Last Wednesday night.

[00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:54.700]
And I tried to call you earlier.

[00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:58.260]
I was listening to that other stations, two AM.

[00:31:58.600 --> 00:31:58.780]
Yeah.

[00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:00.740]
And this guy, a Morocco, whatever's name is.

[00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:01.620]
Rocky Bend over you.

[00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:04.200]
When on record, this is Wednesday night.

[00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:10.040]
OK, when on record to say that they're not going to win a six game Thursday and Pittsburgh is the best.

[00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:11.780]
And even if they do win Thursday.

[00:32:11.780 --> 00:32:16.740]
Of course, I can't imagine why he's saying that since he's going to a job in Pittsburgh as of like yesterday.

[00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:18.160]
I think he left to go to Pittsburgh.

[00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:20.260]
So I wonder why he's sucking around with them already.

[00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:25.080]
Right. And then he said, even if the Panthers win game six, there's no way they're going to win.

[00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:25.920]
Right.

[00:32:26.340 --> 00:32:27.680]
And on and on and on.

[00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:31.460]
You know, so I just like to say one thing with him.

[00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:34.480]
Rocco Pendola throwing out your ass.

[00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:34.960]
Ah.

[00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:36.700]
All right. See you.

[00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:41.760]
Yeah, that's typical of the kind of, then there wasn't a default that picked the penguins to beat us.

[00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:43.460]
And six, I don't want to start picking on Jeff.

[00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:45.100]
Can't see the fourth for his knees.

[00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:49.680]
Who knows nothing about the sport. Unfortunately, I don't want to start picking on him and other sour push.

[00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:53.600]
And what about, oh, how can I have gotten through almost the entire first hour.

[00:32:54.420 --> 00:32:59.720]
And forgotten our good dear friend at the Miami, her old Greg Kotex, you son of a bitch.

[00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:05.720]
Isn't this the guy that said when we lost game four there, which we had the one nothing lead.

[00:33:05.740 --> 00:33:06.860]
We blew it in the third period.

[00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:10.640]
And instead of taking a three to one lead in the series, it wound up two two.

[00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:12.260]
And then we fell behind three two.

[00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:13.980]
And some of us still said, hey, no problem.

[00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:14.560]
We'll be okay.

[00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:20.620]
And after we lost that fourth game, which only even the series up into Cinderella broker slippers.

[00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:23.620]
And where it was nice while it lasted.

[00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:26.340]
And we burst the bubble at all. What was me?

[00:33:27.620 --> 00:33:28.640]
What's his number again?

[00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:29.540]
376.

[00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:30.600]
376.

[00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:31.560]
3492.

[00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:32.800]
3492.

[00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:39.940]
I know a lot of people are real busy today going out and buying banners and t-shirts and caps and paraphernalia and pucks and the schmucks.

[00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:45.920]
But if you have a moment, you might want to fill up his voicemail again and tell him, okay, that's for you, Greg Kotex.

[00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:46.720]
That's it.

[00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:49.280]
I think that's what Wayne was probably talking about.

[00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:51.960]
That's what he was thinking about when he put his head on Brian Scrootland shoulder.

[00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:55.880]
He said, that's for that Greg Kotex who don't believe you got to believe guys.

[00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:57.880]
And he don't believe you're out, Greg.

[00:33:58.240 --> 00:33:59.720]
You piece of walking pus.

[00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:01.900]
There is a piece of pus on two legs.

[00:34:02.100 --> 00:34:06.780]
Greg Kotex at the herald, which he fits it over there like a glove at that pus filled paper.

[00:34:08.180 --> 00:34:10.220]
Oh, yeah, we got no chance now.

[00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:13.120]
The dream is over and you could sense it and you can, yeah, we lost the game.

[00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:17.500]
It wasn't either one that told you every game and the playoffs is different than the one that preceded it.

[00:34:17.780 --> 00:34:19.960]
All those seasons statistics throw them out.

[00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:22.540]
All the games that preceded it throw them out.

[00:34:23.220 --> 00:34:28.720]
Because whatever and the only thing that was consistent for us, thank goodness is that we tied up Mario and Yager.

[00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:34.500]
The entire series, they didn't score a goal between them in the last five games of the series, which is just unbelievable.

[00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:37.000]
And we did a phenomenal job on him.

[00:34:37.020 --> 00:34:41.020]
And I want to tell you something else, Brian Scrootland, I've criticized him a lot during the year and he's deserved it.

[00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:44.760]
But in the playoffs, boy, he's had some of the most incredible moments in that game.

[00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:49.280]
Seven, he not only had Mario covered great, but he had Mario pissed off the whole game.

[00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:52.200]
He was yanking him. He was a slew foot of the mayor one time.

[00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:54.680]
He was in his face if you saw some of those face offs.

[00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:58.640]
Adam Oye Scrooy, he had Mario, he didn't know whether to scream or eat Tchaikita's banana.

[00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:01.660]
He didn't know whether to scream or eat Rob Brindomore's nose.

[00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:04.320]
So it's 1046 at WIOD.

[00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:06.520]
So Florida is new.

[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:10.940]
As others say, she was growing water to wash clothes.

[00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:18.360]
But she does routinely and that's when that child stuck in the water from South Florida's premier news team.

[00:35:18.620 --> 00:35:20.800]
We can express some strong from this promise of the meal.

[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:25.060]
With any strong from this promise of ours, the possibility gets upon across her even for tornadoes.

[00:35:25.060 --> 00:35:26.140]
Love this news.

[00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:28.220]
News talking entertainment radio.

[00:35:30.540 --> 00:35:31.420]
610, WIOD.

[00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:34.220]
This is your boy and the voice of the Toronto May beliefs.

[00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:36.320]
They don't come any better than Neil Rogers.

[00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:39.640]
Here is Grindable for Quinn on a half forward for Luke Gap in front.

[00:35:40.100 --> 00:35:43.820]
Grindable with the fuck, 28 seconds left in the foul of life.

[00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:45.120]
And the blonde hair.

[00:35:46.220 --> 00:35:47.460]
I'm nearly the getter to the point.

[00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:50.460]
Here's a phrase, blazing away from his club on the...

[00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:54.140]
...and the Panthers lead.

[00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:55.200]
What's happening?

[00:35:58.460 --> 00:35:59.460]
So, 1050 at WIOD.

[00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:02.040]
And let me just, we got some faxes here.

[00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:03.120]
Here's one from Zina.

[00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:05.480]
And I didn't hear the call, but I had a...

[00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:09.820]
Oh, first before that, Jim Schoenfeld or the Caps is the one that told Don Kowarski, go eat another donut.

[00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:11.060]
And you're absolutely correct.

[00:36:11.140 --> 00:36:12.360]
I had a couple of faxes about that.

[00:36:12.940 --> 00:36:15.460]
Zina says, Neil, I had a panther party at my home Saturday.

[00:36:15.460 --> 00:36:16.740]
And I had two barbecued penguins.

[00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:18.540]
Stakes thought my heart was going to come out of my chest.

[00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:20.480]
It was pounding so hard in my heart, too, what a game.

[00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:24.680]
And here's the PSD, the piece of ass out of the resistance.

[00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:28.320]
I called the WIOD Sunday morning, Sports Show, and asked,

[00:36:28.420 --> 00:36:31.300]
is anyone thank Neil Rogers for turning this town out of the most exciting,

[00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:33.020]
almost orgasm, and sport in his day and age.

[00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:36.060]
And I continued, Neil worked his ass off trying to open our eyes to hockey,

[00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:37.660]
and I haven't heard anyone say thanks to Neil.

[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:41.060]
Would you believe the host of the show, I think, it was Kimba Bojangles,

[00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:44.480]
completely blew off what I was saying, and said that we have to praise the Panthers

[00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:45.440]
and not Neil Rogers.

[00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:47.380]
What an assholes, Ena says.

[00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:49.000]
He completely missed the point.

[00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:50.560]
I wasn't taking away from the Panthers.

[00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:53.480]
I was commenting on how, at least in my case, if we were not for you,

[00:36:53.780 --> 00:36:56.340]
I would have been missing out on the electricity of such thrilling events.

[00:36:56.660 --> 00:36:58.220]
Plus, Beeser, I love you, says Zina.

[00:36:58.500 --> 00:36:59.300]
Nice going, Zina.

[00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:00.240]
No, God.

[00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:00.920]
There you go.

[00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:05.400]
See, the thing that pleases me is like the coach and the general manager

[00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:08.320]
and the president of the team and all the people in the organization.

[00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:12.940]
They know that some of us have worked our asses off, our fat asses off for three years,

[00:37:12.940 --> 00:37:16.600]
trying to get everybody into it and explain to them what they were missing,

[00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:20.620]
and put asses in those seats, even during ordinary pedestrian games,

[00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:23.600]
when it wasn't the Stanley Cup playoffs, it much less the finals.

[00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:28.840]
And so people like Bo Camper, who has no business to be talking about hockey in the first place,

[00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:32.400]
he can go on there and be a sour poise and plays a little silly cart and do his little thing.

[00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:33.380]
All he wants, okay?

[00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:34.940]
We act more mature on this show.

[00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:37.580]
Yeah, we don't play a bunch of silly little carts and sound effects.

[00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:39.500]
Okay, Bojangles, I'll grow up.

[00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:40.400]
You dumb jock.

[00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:42.440]
Here's Jupiter.

[00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:42.820]
Hello.

[00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:44.440]
Eddie Burr.

[00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:45.100]
Well, that's good.

[00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:46.100]
Blow it out, Eddie's ass.

[00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:46.560]
Okay.

[00:37:47.020 --> 00:37:48.000]
Here's the lady in North Miami.

[00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:48.440]
Hello.

[00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:49.140]
Hi, Neil.

[00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:49.660]
How you doing?

[00:37:49.660 --> 00:37:50.000]
Okay.

[00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:51.520]
I went to spec today.

[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:53.020]
I figured I'd try my luck.

[00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:54.600]
There were about 200 people in line.

[00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:55.040]
Yeah.

[00:37:55.380 --> 00:37:57.740]
And you know, they put all the numbers in a thing and pull them out.

[00:37:57.740 --> 00:37:58.000]
Terrible.

[00:37:58.160 --> 00:37:58.660]
That's awful.

[00:37:58.780 --> 00:37:59.180]
I hate that.

[00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:01.520]
I mean, whatever number, if you're close, you've got it.

[00:38:01.660 --> 00:38:01.980]
So what do they do?

[00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:05.340]
These poor people that stood on lines in Saturday night and then they wind up getting shine.

[00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:05.920]
That's bad.

[00:38:06.060 --> 00:38:06.400]
No, I know.

[00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:07.140]
They'll learn.

[00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:08.740]
They pick number 50.

[00:38:08.980 --> 00:38:09.680]
I'm 51.

[00:38:10.060 --> 00:38:11.240]
I am ecstatic.

[00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:12.560]
I know I got tickets.

[00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:13.260]
You got them?

[00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:14.160]
I get second in line.

[00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:16.620]
It turns out I have 151.

[00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:19.200]
I was 100 people behind.

[00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:20.340]
Oh, my God.

[00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:21.800]
Oh, I was so depressed.

[00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:23.180]
I blow my brains out.

[00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:24.080]
Or maybe there is.

[00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:24.360]
I did.

[00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:24.520]
I did.

[00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:27.980]
You know, my husband had a good point about Claude Lemieux.

[00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:28.300]
Yeah.

[00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:31.740]
He wears a face mask on his face.

[00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:32.180]
That's right.

[00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:33.000]
He's protected.

[00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:33.600]
Oh, sure.

[00:38:33.740 --> 00:38:36.100]
He's just like old Samuel Sinow also wears the face mask.

[00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:36.500]
That's right.

[00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:37.600]
They wear the plastic shield.

[00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:39.020]
So nobody can get their ass.

[00:38:39.020 --> 00:38:43.220]
But they need tender steering and the gouging and cross checking everybody else out there.

[00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:43.460]
Right.

[00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:43.940]
I know.

[00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:44.440]
I know.

[00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:47.100]
I hope we give him a good one like we did to Yager.

[00:38:47.180 --> 00:38:47.840]
He'll get a good one.

[00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:48.300]
No, not Yager.

[00:38:48.380 --> 00:38:48.980]
Who was it?

[00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:49.780]
Yager.

[00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:51.080]
Maybe in the Phil with Lindros.

[00:38:51.460 --> 00:38:51.620]
Yeah.

[00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:52.360]
And Yager too.

[00:38:52.460 --> 00:38:53.500]
Yager got belted twice.

[00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:53.720]
Oh, yeah.

[00:38:53.720 --> 00:38:54.060]
I know.

[00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:56.080]
He was unconscious in a couple minutes there.

[00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:58.440]
You know, we're looking for flags for the car.

[00:38:58.580 --> 00:39:02.160]
So if anybody, we went to sawgress this weekend and nobody had him.

[00:39:02.180 --> 00:39:03.200]
Everybody was out of them.

[00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:03.520]
Okay.

[00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:05.200]
We'll find a 751.

[00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:09.000]
Like I said, if he got Panther flags, Panther T-shirts, Panther Red.

[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:09.220]
He got a lot of flags.

[00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:10.060]
Pirifanelia.

[00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:11.420]
Facts it over to us.

[00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:12.320]
758.

[00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:12.960]
W-I-D.

[00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:15.580]
We'll put the word out and you'll be sold out in two minutes or less.

[00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:16.920]
Also, I had a great palm.

[00:39:16.980 --> 00:39:18.300]
Somebody faxed me here too.

[00:39:18.660 --> 00:39:20.520]
I don't know who it's from, but it's good enough to read.

[00:39:20.680 --> 00:39:22.800]
It says, first were the Bruins.

[00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:23.740]
They left them in ruins.

[00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:25.660]
Next came the flyers and other wrong hire.

[00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:28.220]
The penguins were great, but these birds, the cat ate.

[00:39:29.060 --> 00:39:29.860]
The cat's eight.

[00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:32.120]
The avalanche are good too, but the cats know what to do.

[00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:35.220]
By using the rat's power, his lord Stanley Cup will be ours.

[00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:36.500]
Let's go, Panthers.

[00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:37.460]
Nice going, guys.

[00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:39.300]
Whoever you are, go ahead.

[00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:41.920]
Here's the curl springs on the purple line.

[00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:42.180]
Hello.

[00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:43.540]
Yes sir.

[00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:43.560]

[00:39:43.580 --> 00:39:44.560]
A color long time listener.

[00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:45.020]
All right.

[00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:47.860]
Try to get tickets this morning.

[00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:49.780]
Bad luck didn't get any.

[00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:50.100]
Yeah.

[00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:52.420]
I wanted to tell you that I was flipping through the channels,

[00:39:52.420 --> 00:39:54.560]
winding my bed with my girlfriend last night.

[00:39:54.900 --> 00:39:57.980]
And watching channel seven highlights and everything.

[00:39:58.220 --> 00:39:58.900]
Pretty cool highlights.

[00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:01.000]
But we turned on sports wrap.

[00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:03.120]
Have you ever seen that show before?

[00:40:03.540 --> 00:40:05.880]
I was on that show last year, briefly.

[00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:06.420]
Twice.

[00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:08.500]
Before they decided they wanted Denise Poppan,

[00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:09.840]
I told her to blow it out their ass.

[00:40:09.900 --> 00:40:10.520]
Funny thing.

[00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:11.900]
We're lying in bed.

[00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:14.700]
You think it's Kim Bo campers on that show?

[00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:15.800]
No, Manwich.

[00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:16.540]
Manwich and...

[00:40:16.540 --> 00:40:17.120]
Manwich and...

[00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:18.560]
Manwich and deforest.

[00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:19.780]
Okay, deforest.

[00:40:19.980 --> 00:40:22.520]
And you flipped up left, as they said.

[00:40:22.740 --> 00:40:23.920]
Florida and Colorado.

[00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:28.380]
Florida's had success with Wabby for it.

[00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:30.980]
But instead of saying success, he came out and said,

[00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:35.000]
Well Florida's had sex with Patrick Wabby for it.

[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:36.300]
We were checked ass.

[00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:37.440]
Yeah, that's probably see.

[00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:39.460]
Manwich showered so many times with the dolphins,

[00:40:39.460 --> 00:40:42.000]
even when he wasn't playing that that's all he thinks about.

[00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:43.320]
You know, he's having sex with the player.

[00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:44.760]
What's the thing with you is the other guy,

[00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:46.980]
we just flipped it on for a second and he said that.

[00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:49.180]
And we were rolling on the floor.

[00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:52.920]
Yeah, well, I guess it's the divorce depot's high for anybody at this point.

[00:40:52.980 --> 00:40:55.440]
Yeah, and Manwich goes, we know what you have on your mind.

[00:40:55.580 --> 00:40:55.740]
Right.

[00:40:56.380 --> 00:40:57.800]
So this one is the call you up with.

[00:40:57.800 --> 00:40:58.660]
Well, they're on top of it.

[00:40:58.700 --> 00:40:59.780]
Make no mistake about that.

[00:40:59.780 --> 00:41:01.000]
They're right on top of these things.

[00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:03.820]
Well, Neil, just wanted to call you and let you know I'm on my way to work.

[00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:06.180]
Just wanted to let you know you are the hockey god.

[00:41:06.260 --> 00:41:06.720]
Okay, pal.

[00:41:06.780 --> 00:41:07.300]
Take care.

[00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:07.900]
Hang in there.

[00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:08.340]
Bye-bye.

[00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:10.820]
Yeah, the avalanche don't take them lightly, baby,

[00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:12.560]
because they got a great team and I'd like to point out,

[00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:15.360]
because I hear these very unknowledgeable people saying,

[00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:17.920]
oh, well, Claude Lemumus in those first two games is a big deal.

[00:41:18.260 --> 00:41:19.780]
You might think it is, but it's not.

[00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:20.320]
Okay.

[00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:23.620]
Because he was suspended earlier in the Detroit series when he,

[00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:28.460]
just beryld in the coslov and smacked him from behind,

[00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:31.360]
gave him a cheap punch in the back of the head when he wasn't looking.

[00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:33.600]
And he got one game for that.

[00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:35.940]
So what happened in that game?

[00:41:36.220 --> 00:41:36.820]
Avalanche one.

[00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:39.800]
Then he gets suspended for, you know, again, here,

[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:43.560]
and not suspended, but thrown out of the game in the sixth and final game.

[00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:45.980]
Early in the game, he did the number on Chris Draper.

[00:41:46.180 --> 00:41:47.920]
He gets throughout that game, Avalanche win a game.

[00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:51.780]
So two games he's missed already and they Avalanche won both games.

[00:41:51.940 --> 00:41:53.420]
So don't take this team lightly, okay?

[00:41:53.620 --> 00:41:55.320]
Because they could be damn dangerous.

[00:41:56.380 --> 00:41:57.660]
Mounted by Fetalov.

[00:41:58.340 --> 00:42:01.860]
Sackyke winds up in his own zone, leaving it for the defense foot.

[00:42:02.460 --> 00:42:03.440]
He's up to Saturday.

[00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:05.480]
Sackyke win a close shot.

[00:42:05.620 --> 00:42:06.380]
Big rebound.

[00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:10.800]
Here the wave of the Red Wing with 20 seconds left in the period.

[00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:15.080]
Here's a centering pass and a foot score.

[00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:38.900]
Pull it.

[00:42:39.340 --> 00:42:39.760]
Shot.

[00:42:40.620 --> 00:42:41.660]
A late ball, boys.

[00:42:41.740 --> 00:42:42.980]
15 seconds to go.

[00:42:43.140 --> 00:42:43.460]
You're down.

[00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:44.500]
Two instead of three.

[00:42:44.980 --> 00:42:46.320]
This could be a real asset.

[00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:46.780]
Look out.

[00:42:46.980 --> 00:42:47.580]
Not done yet.

[00:42:47.720 --> 00:42:48.180]
Bit bars.

[00:42:50.860 --> 00:42:51.660]
Bit bars.

[00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:52.080]

[00:43:18.220 --> 00:43:20.940]
And not only did they got a hell of a lot of guns out there offensive,

[00:43:20.940 --> 00:43:23.880]
but they got a much much much better defense than Pittsburgh.

[00:43:24.020 --> 00:43:25.340]
Okay, Magnum mistake about that.

[00:43:25.380 --> 00:43:26.840]
So just I just want you to keep that in mind.

[00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:27.200]
Okay.

[00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:29.440]
I'm not saying that we're not going to win because I think we are,

[00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:30.700]
but it ain't going to be no cakewalk.

[00:43:31.460 --> 00:43:32.660]
Here's the lady in Cooper City.

[00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:32.940]
Hello.

[00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:33.780]
Hi, Neil.

[00:43:33.900 --> 00:43:34.440]
Yes, ma'am.

[00:43:34.940 --> 00:43:38.100]
I tell you, Neil, about what, 47 minutes ago,

[00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:40.420]
I could have been diagnosed as having major depression.

[00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:41.320]
Why is that?

[00:43:41.620 --> 00:43:43.280]
Because I went down to, I think,

[00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:46.620]
I'm okay, I'll go down to specs, I'll get in line, you know, why not?

[00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:46.980]
Yeah.

[00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:51.080]
I'm driving by Blockbuster music over in Pemberg Pines near the Yamal.

[00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:51.580]
Yeah.

[00:43:51.660 --> 00:43:52.620]
And there was like nobody there.

[00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:53.740]
There were like 40 people there.

[00:43:53.880 --> 00:43:56.080]
So I was like, I'll go there because my chances will be better.

[00:43:56.560 --> 00:43:57.800]
So I go there and get my number.

[00:43:58.200 --> 00:43:59.880]
I was like, okay, I have about half an hour.

[00:44:00.060 --> 00:44:01.400]
Went to go get a soda, came back.

[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:03.620]
And a whole bunch of people were leaving.

[00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:04.980]
So I said, oh, you know what's going on.

[00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:07.380]
I said, okay, well, we picked a number that we're going to start with.

[00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:08.540]
I said, okay, what is it?

[00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:09.480]
663.

[00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:10.440]
I look at mine.

[00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:11.120]
Wow.

[00:44:11.460 --> 00:44:12.440]
That's 667.

[00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:14.280]
Wow, number five.

[00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:16.480]
I'm going to call some sitting in line.

[00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:17.860]
I'm really nervous.

[00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:21.000]
And first person gets four tickets.

[00:44:21.300 --> 00:44:22.560]
Second person gets four tickets.

[00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:24.180]
Third person gets four tickets.

[00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:26.000]
Next person gets four.

[00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:27.200]
And you're out.

[00:44:27.420 --> 00:44:28.160]
And they're all gone.

[00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:01.000]
In this moment, we are having a promise to make together

[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:02.880]
that we can make together.

[00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:04.560]
Thank you.

[00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:07.980]
eleven oh five at w-w-i-d you got a combination now man you got to teach

[00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:11.960]
your and the student together at one time how you doing Doug great how are you

[00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:15.780]
I'm telling you man I came so close to having a heart attack during that game on

[00:47:15.780 --> 00:47:19.400]
Saturday I could just imagine what you were going through I know it was actually

[00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:22.080]
an old nail at the edge you're on the bench because you're working and you're

[00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:27.220]
not really thinking as much about what can go wrong maybe and all your sort of

[00:47:27.220 --> 00:47:31.520]
you're busy I guess is the thing sometimes my mother she spends the games in the

[00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:36.220]
kitchen cleaning up she told me the other time sometimes things happen in a

[00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:39.540]
game and you get the feeling that maybe there's something in the air there

[00:47:39.540 --> 00:47:42.920]
you know because I was saying after they tied it up one one I was saying all we

[00:47:42.920 --> 00:47:45.940]
need is a lucky break I had a feeling all we need was something good to happen

[00:47:45.940 --> 00:47:50.080]
and then Wilkinson got his stick on Tommy shot there and that made a knuckle

[00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:52.920]
ball and got in the net and then even Garpert Law School it looked like maybe

[00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:56.020]
Brass was gonna stop it and he got a piece that went over his shoulder when you

[00:47:56.020 --> 00:47:59.320]
saw those two goals you get the feeling something is in the air for us I got

[00:47:59.320 --> 00:48:04.760]
admit when the third one in I felt pretty good yeah you could see that it was a

[00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:09.880]
relief so what kind of a grueling trip did you guys have out there well we we

[00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:13.760]
got here at five o'clock yesterday morning am and it was you know it was a good

[00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:17.880]
trip though we had lots of fun and lots of laughs and enjoyed the the moment you

[00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:21.980]
know it was pretty good I think the bus ride from Pittsburgh out to the airport was

[00:48:21.980 --> 00:48:25.640]
maybe the best bus ride I've ever been on in my life I mean it was put on a

[00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:30.960]
highlight tape and out of laughs and cheers and just just a lot of fun and you know

[00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:34.780]
watching CBC the other night cherry finally came out of the closet he says you

[00:48:34.780 --> 00:48:38.060]
know who I'm rooting for I'm rooting for the Panthers and they're on a claim

[00:48:38.060 --> 00:48:40.860]
pointed out that most of Canada I guess the exception here will be that

[00:48:40.860 --> 00:48:44.280]
segment of Quebec where those frogs are still you know the avalanche and the

[00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:48.160]
Nordican at-hole deal but other than Quebec I think Canada is behind us I guess

[00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:52.500]
it's unbelievable my brother and Vancouver told me that the Panther jerseys

[00:48:52.500 --> 00:48:56.900]
and hats and t-shirts out there unbelievable so I think it's really taken off

[00:48:56.900 --> 00:49:01.280]
all over the country so it's gonna that's pretty special you know that we've

[00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:05.040]
a such a new team and we've picked up lots of fans and I'll tell you if you

[00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:08.580]
watch your team it's tough not to like them yeah there's not one guy on his

[00:49:08.580 --> 00:49:12.600]
team that you can't help but like and you know the thing that is amazing is

[00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:15.640]
that guys who I don't want to get in what thing about who's gonna sit and who's

[00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:19.240]
gonna play but guys who have been sad out who've been healthy scratches at one

[00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:23.100]
time or another and some of them recently like Mike off he was healthy scratch a

[00:49:23.100 --> 00:49:26.780]
few times he's really come back alive and his he's got like totally rejuvenated

[00:49:26.780 --> 00:49:31.300]
in this series Garper Love who was scratched a few times here in the playoffs played

[00:49:31.300 --> 00:49:35.880]
a tremendous game on Saturday and got the big goal yeah that shows what kind of

[00:49:35.880 --> 00:49:39.500]
team guys are in and you have to be like that this time of year and it's it's

[00:49:39.500 --> 00:49:42.940]
tough on guys when they get saddled like it kills them to be quite honest you

[00:49:42.940 --> 00:49:47.080]
know because they all want to be out there but the team's number one this time of

[00:49:47.080 --> 00:49:52.100]
year you sacrifice for the team right now now what's the what's the feedback out

[00:49:52.100 --> 00:49:56.040]
there's somebody just facts me a column from the Rocky Mountain news in Denver

[00:49:56.040 --> 00:50:00.140]
that says Panthers will frustrate the avalanche it says McLean and his cats deserve

[00:50:00.140 --> 00:50:04.140]
utmost respect and credit and I'll take it a step further I don't think they've

[00:50:04.140 --> 00:50:06.680]
gotten either of those and I'll tell you one thing in Pittsburgh they were still

[00:50:06.680 --> 00:50:09.900]
crying to blues after that game stand server and on KBL was still not given

[00:50:09.900 --> 00:50:14.280]
to send a credit and it was really sad to see what lack of class they showed up

[00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:17.020]
there's some of those guys although the penguins I thought you showed a lot of

[00:50:17.020 --> 00:50:20.540]
class after the game but some of the sports writers liked it are they given us

[00:50:20.540 --> 00:50:23.520]
some credit out there in Denver they are there's been a lot I haven't seen

[00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:28.540]
today's papers but there hasn't been a lot of you know what I get a kick out of

[00:50:28.540 --> 00:50:32.900]
the respect thing and I've said it all year I the media is the problem that's

[00:50:32.900 --> 00:50:36.360]
that's where we don't get respect we get unbelievable respect from our peers

[00:50:36.360 --> 00:50:39.500]
that's the players and the league and the coaches and managers and that when

[00:50:39.500 --> 00:50:42.880]
you're in this business that's really all you care about you know because I'll

[00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:47.760]
say a Mario Lemieux and and Yomere Yaggin here these guys really respect the

[00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:51.480]
Panthers they know how hard it is to play against the Panthers and and the

[00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:54.360]
players in the league respect this team like you wouldn't believe and that's

[00:50:54.360 --> 00:50:57.900]
what it's all about well you know Mario after game six said I'm sure you saw

[00:50:57.900 --> 00:51:01.560]
the Clipper said it was the best defensive team after game seven and I don't

[00:51:01.560 --> 00:51:04.200]
know if you got a chance to see that but he said this is the best team he

[00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:07.400]
played against you know ever played against that right which is a hell of a

[00:51:07.400 --> 00:51:11.200]
compliment now it really is because Mario's a class guy really is and he had a

[00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:15.780]
tough series and you know he was the first guy over to shake hands after you know

[00:51:15.780 --> 00:51:19.860]
and I really appreciate it that and Eddie Johnson too of course being a next

[00:51:19.860 --> 00:51:22.700]
gold tender coming from him it really means something he said Beezer was so

[00:51:22.700 --> 00:51:25.940]
great which he was on Saturday said we could have kept playing for another seven

[00:51:25.940 --> 00:51:28.380]
days and the way he was playing we were not going to get another one in there

[00:51:28.380 --> 00:51:33.340]
no hope he keeps it up yeah he was if he's if he's ever played a better game than

[00:51:33.340 --> 00:51:36.980]
that I just don't know how how it's possible I mean he's what a playoff

[00:51:36.980 --> 00:51:41.420]
this guy yeah I mean it's been unbelievable really when you look at you know

[00:51:41.420 --> 00:51:45.380]
what he's done and I tell you he fought through some tough times this year and I

[00:51:45.380 --> 00:51:49.680]
give him all the credit in the world because he's a guy he's a guy that gives us a

[00:51:49.680 --> 00:51:53.760]
chance now what about the avalanche I know that Lemieux is going to miss the first two

[00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:56.940]
games and some of these people who aren't too I've been trying to point out that

[00:51:56.940 --> 00:52:01.340]
Lemieux got suspended for one of the games against Detroit after he smacked

[00:52:01.340 --> 00:52:05.060]
Karsloven back of the head and they won that game and then he got tossed out for

[00:52:05.060 --> 00:52:08.520]
doing the number on draper in the sixth game and they won that game easily so

[00:52:08.960 --> 00:52:11.720]
people that think because cloud Lemieux getting tossed out for a couple of

[00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:15.040]
games it's gonna make it easier I think they better be careful they've got a

[00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:18.720]
real good team I think the big thing they have gone at the other teams we

[00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:23.180]
played had didn't was they got tremendous depth like you watch the tapes and

[00:52:23.180 --> 00:52:27.340]
it's hard to find a problem area with them they're pretty sound everywhere you

[00:52:27.340 --> 00:52:31.340]
know so that's a concern I think they've got three or four legitimate stars

[00:52:31.340 --> 00:52:34.840]
but they've got a lot of real good players and they sure have a great defense I'll

[00:52:34.840 --> 00:52:38.460]
say that yeah they do and they're big and they're strong they're not a physically

[00:52:38.460 --> 00:52:42.660]
tough team I don't think but they're they're really sound in every area and

[00:52:42.660 --> 00:52:46.560]
you're not gonna intimidate them and you're not gonna you know you're not gonna

[00:52:46.560 --> 00:52:49.960]
wear them down I don't think so I'm a little nervous about them in Patrick

[00:52:49.960 --> 00:52:54.740]
Walk and can be beach as well so yeah but you know something we we have had his

[00:52:54.740 --> 00:52:58.260]
number especially when he was with much y'all but the thing that he was going

[00:52:58.260 --> 00:53:01.840]
down there on a golf holiday is that what it was the thing that really gets me

[00:53:02.560 --> 00:53:06.160]
the thing that really I believe about him is if you hit him with a lot of shots

[00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:09.200]
you're gonna score some goals if he if he has the great defense and if they

[00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:12.340]
protect him he'll make a couple of great saves in a game but as long as he

[00:53:12.340 --> 00:53:17.420]
doesn't get barrage with a lot of shots he'll be good 40 or 50 you'll be good

[00:53:17.420 --> 00:53:20.960]
for a star we'll throw 160 in there just to remind him but I'll tell you they've

[00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:24.480]
got a real good team but I'll tell you something now we got a real good team

[00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:27.920]
to we sure do and it's gonna be fun and I want you to know because you're out

[00:53:27.920 --> 00:53:31.820]
there but I'm telling you yesterday the TV stations here all of a sudden they

[00:53:31.820 --> 00:53:34.980]
discovered the Panthers they discovered hockey they discovered you they

[00:53:34.980 --> 00:53:38.240]
discovered Brian Murray and Bill Terry they rediscovered everything I'll tell

[00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:42.260]
you the guy that really bothers me a lot is Brian Murray doesn't get his name

[00:53:42.260 --> 00:53:46.680]
never gets mentioned very often but I'll tell you this guy is so solid what

[00:53:46.680 --> 00:53:51.380]
he's done for this organization is scary all he's the man right now all he did

[00:53:51.380 --> 00:53:54.400]
was build two of the last of the final four teams in a playoffs to

[00:53:54.400 --> 00:53:58.440]
Troiton the Panthers it's all he did that's right Mr. A thing is a lucky guy to have

[00:53:58.440 --> 00:54:02.120]
this guy I'll tell you that he's he's a he's the main man well Wayne is going

[00:54:02.120 --> 00:54:05.420]
through a second childhood yesterday I don't know if you got a chance to see him

[00:54:05.420 --> 00:54:08.340]
in a hallway out there when a game ended but he was out there with screwy and at

[00:54:08.340 --> 00:54:11.700]
one point he just lost and he kind of put his he put his head over again screwy

[00:54:11.700 --> 00:54:16.100]
shoulder and he went like that he just he just lost it he was speechless he had

[00:54:16.100 --> 00:54:19.520]
no words like you know what he's been on believe it he comes in the dressing room

[00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:23.720]
in my office before the games on the road and he just he just walks in

[00:54:23.720 --> 00:54:27.080]

all we got so lucky to you i feel so fortunate i i've been so excited and you've

[01:00:05.060 --> 01:00:08.420]
made it exciting to listen to and in in the little clips that you play here

[01:00:08.420 --> 01:00:08.880]
and there it's

[01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:11.220]
just so exciting and uh...

[01:00:11.220 --> 01:00:11.940]
we just can't wait

[01:00:11.940 --> 01:00:15.160]
to the line uh... this morning they did a lottery thing

[01:00:15.780 --> 01:00:18.200]
and i've been in line with a two and a half month old baby

[01:00:18.680 --> 01:00:20.880]
and survive that baby was great

[01:00:21.540 --> 01:00:25.920]
and now we're just totally psyched with the game fantastic excited and uh...

[01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:29.120]
thank you for making it exciting to listen to two little bits that you play

[01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:31.540]
watching that's what that's why i got to stay here all week they've been offering

[01:00:31.540 --> 01:00:35.760]
to send me to Denver you know but i just i feel compelled i feel like uh...

[01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:39.040]
i got to be there taping off the cbc bringing in these highlights getting

[01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:41.400]
everybody whipped up the uh... the town needs me you know

[01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:44.380]
most of the time they can live without me but right now this town needs me

[01:00:44.380 --> 01:00:48.160]
badly and spread what both campuses now you're the best cheerleader for this team

[01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:50.540]
okay have a good one i'll see you there

[01:00:50.540 --> 01:00:54.100]
alright how do you like that there's a lucky lady that got there of course

[01:00:54.100 --> 01:00:56.600]
these other people probably want to find out where she is and beat the

[01:00:56.600 --> 01:01:00.060]
stuffings out of her but that's just our grapes okay too bad you lose

[01:01:01.140 --> 01:01:05.460]
anyway this town is on fire the phones are smoking and let me say it again

[01:01:05.460 --> 01:01:09.800]
because it gives me tremendous satisfaction knowing and having known for many

[01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:13.480]
many many years of my life that there's nothing when it comes to sports that

[01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:17.640]
can touch hockey number one and not that can't even come close to the standing

[01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:18.500]
couple a us

[01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:22.560]
there's nothing that generates the excitement the psychosis and i'll say it

[01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:25.440]
again in case you missed it earlier i have it through the grapevine

[01:01:25.900 --> 01:01:29.680]
uh... by way of john shan and the executive producer of cbc's hockey night in

[01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:33.060]
canada that's Saturday nights game that's us the panthers and the penguins

[01:01:33.060 --> 01:01:37.400]

[01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:40.640]
watched that game that have ever watched any game on hockey night in canada

[01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:44.200]
they've been on the air televising since the early fifties so that's over forty

[01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:44.700]
years

[01:01:44.700 --> 01:01:46.040]
so how do you like that

[01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:49.560]
ooo we're boring team allegedly we must be getting somebody worked up

[01:01:49.560 --> 01:01:52.380]
eleven twenty two at w i o d

[01:01:52.380 --> 01:01:54.760]
use talk entertainment radio

[01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:55.940]
six ten

[01:01:55.940 --> 01:01:58.140]
w i o d

[01:01:58.140 --> 01:01:59.580]
what's the sub-session with hockey

[01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:02.140]
after the long the boards

[01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:07.420]
and it's put high in the year by Terry Kirkner in the center i

[01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:13.560]
and now the panthers getting across through the head right on the stick of

[01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:13.960]
zubah

[01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:16.880]
two-bygge and go as he hits the

[01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:18.140]
four-to-line

[01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:21.220]
just from behind by streetland panthers will turn

[01:02:22.060 --> 01:02:22.780]
streetland's loose

[01:02:22.780 --> 01:02:25.900]
and here's my cup three on one

[01:02:25.900 --> 01:02:28.100]
it's from high up to the scores

[01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:31.440]
my cup has opened the scoring for Florida

[01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:32.520]
yes

[01:02:33.640 --> 01:02:35.460]
only four seconds to go

[01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:39.020]
in the power play as love you hits the streaking yoghurt

[01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:41.620]
following up to the view net that's

[01:02:42.420 --> 01:02:43.280]
another one

[01:02:58.260 --> 01:03:00.060]
like the

[01:03:00.060 --> 01:03:00.200]
OL

[01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:01.000]
stuff

[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.320]
to head to top this year over the line.

[01:03:03.820 --> 01:03:06.700]
Stars top this year and the

[01:03:06.700 --> 01:03:08.100]
Panthers are back in front.

[01:03:08.220 --> 01:03:08.560]
Yes.

[01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:10.640]
Yes.

[01:03:12.020 --> 01:03:13.780]
Three minutes to play in the third.

[01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:17.540]
The auger to Mirana.

[01:03:18.540 --> 01:03:19.660]
Sands from going to the net.

[01:03:19.980 --> 01:03:22.780]
Park comes out in front and Bill Lindsay starts back.

[01:03:23.300 --> 01:03:24.920]
Here's a two on one for Florida.

[01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:27.440]
Lindsay over the line passes across.

[01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:28.980]
Please go over.

[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.660]
Your head garp and lob is three one.

[01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:37.680]
Panthers on the label.

[01:03:38.300 --> 01:03:41.560]
The army auger said before the playoffs started this season.

[01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:47.720]
He said he said I really hate the playoffs because it is so hard to play offensive hockey.

[01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:50.320]
It's so much more fun during the regular season.

[01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:54.480]
Well, boy, have the Panthers ever made that a true is a mirror in this series.

[01:03:55.100 --> 01:03:56.540]
They've held this team down.

[01:03:57.040 --> 01:03:59.920]
It'll be just about 2.3 goals a game in the series.

[01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:01.320]
Centering pass in.

[01:04:01.460 --> 01:04:02.520]
But shot to flex it.

[01:04:02.820 --> 01:04:03.520]
Back counter.

[01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:04.900]
And these broke on the auger.

[01:04:04.940 --> 01:04:06.940]
Talked it away on the fire side.

[01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:08.080]
Zubab holding it.

[01:04:08.340 --> 01:04:09.480]
Count down underway.

[01:04:09.980 --> 01:04:10.380]
And Florida.

[01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:12.680]
Set up right your team season.

[01:04:13.220 --> 01:04:15.500]
They are going to stand in the final.

[01:04:16.360 --> 01:04:18.140]
Panthers have beaten Pittsburgh.

[01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:18.720]
Trinidad.

[01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:21.020]
Yes.

[01:04:22.460 --> 01:04:22.960]
Yes.

[01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:23.680]

[01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:23.900]
Yes.

[01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:24.480]

[01:04:24.540 --> 01:04:24.660]
Yes.

[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:26.740]
Yeah, this is a pretty positive article here.

[01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:28.840]
It's the first one I'm reading from the Denver press.

[01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:31.280]
It's a lot better than anybody in Pittsburgh ever wrote about us.

[01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:35.160]
Panthers will frustrate the avalanche by Bob Kravitz in a Rocky Mountain news.

[01:04:35.420 --> 01:04:38.980]
And he goes on about all the integrate individuals we have on his team and about race

[01:04:38.980 --> 01:04:43.220]
shepherd and Martin Strocken, Robbie Nidemar and Jovonowski's passing and Vorak and

[01:04:43.220 --> 01:04:44.280]
Svalod, Sedermann, so on.

[01:04:44.620 --> 01:04:47.800]
It says this team is full of guys who are winning with more than effort.

[01:04:48.380 --> 01:04:49.020]
That's right.

[01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:50.340]
There's some talent there, baby.

[01:04:50.340 --> 01:04:52.240]
It's not just a and here's another one.

[01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:53.360]
What's this from New York Times?

[01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:54.520]
Panthers success.

[01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:55.660]
Leave it to be.

[01:04:56.340 --> 01:05:00.760]
And if that wasn't the greatest game that's ever been played by maybe not just by him by anybody,

[01:05:00.760 --> 01:05:01.900]
yeah, he did let the one in.

[01:05:01.900 --> 01:05:03.860]
I mean, guys have had a lot of shutouts, including him.

[01:05:04.140 --> 01:05:07.900]
But that game he stopped in Yagur on breakaways, clear cut right in front.

[01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:09.320]
Dave Rose, two, three shots.

[01:05:09.320 --> 01:05:12.420]
He's whacking at it and the beas are just was invincible, man.

[01:05:12.460 --> 01:05:17.660]
And the only goal they did get on a power play, Ned vid made a perfect shot just inside the post.

[01:05:17.700 --> 01:05:19.580]
I think the beas are was partially screened on it.

[01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:20.460]
No chance.

[01:05:20.820 --> 01:05:23.340]
But other than that man, he was like a like a wall.

[01:05:24.060 --> 01:05:25.680]
And if he keeps playing like that, guess what?

[01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:27.200]
We're going to be hoisting it and a cup too.

[01:05:28.100 --> 01:05:29.640]
Here's a mobile in West Palm Beach.

[01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:29.880]
Hello.

[01:05:30.620 --> 01:05:30.980]
Hello.

[01:05:31.300 --> 01:05:31.660]
Yes, sir.

[01:05:31.980 --> 01:05:32.400]
Neil.

[01:05:32.740 --> 01:05:33.300]
Yes, I am.

[01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:35.240]
Herbert for Harvard from Philadelphia.

[01:05:35.780 --> 01:05:36.160]
Yes, sir.

[01:05:36.380 --> 01:05:37.620]
Your team really looked great.

[01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:38.580]
Yes, they did.

[01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:40.040]
I just moved here.

[01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:41.620]
The panthers really looked super.

[01:05:41.980 --> 01:05:42.480]
Yes, they did.

[01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:45.060]
How many years ago were you in, Philly?

[01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:46.280]
I never was.

[01:05:46.620 --> 01:05:48.200]
I thought you were doing what?

[01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:50.220]
I thought you were on radio there.

[01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:51.100]
I don't think so.

[01:05:51.320 --> 01:05:51.600]
No.

[01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:53.960]
Not that I remember, of course, it could have been another life.

[01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:56.700]
Well, good luck to them.

[01:05:56.760 --> 01:05:57.660]
OK, thanks a lot, pal.

[01:05:58.080 --> 01:05:58.220]
OK.

[01:05:58.600 --> 01:06:00.940]
See you on the wonderful world of Dolly Banks, whatever that is.

[01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:06.980]
We have an open line in the Green Line 1-800-944-946-3184-44-W-I-O-D.

[01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:08.720]
Here's Sunrise.

[01:06:09.020 --> 01:06:09.160]
Hello.

[01:06:10.420 --> 01:06:11.140]
Good morning, Neil.

[01:06:11.320 --> 01:06:11.640]
Yes, sir.

[01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:15.800]
The unbelievable mighty panthers are seriously on the map.

[01:06:16.220 --> 01:06:20.260]
And the sales of Panther paraphernalia are up, including Gary Glitter.

[01:06:20.760 --> 01:06:20.980]
Uh-huh.

[01:06:20.980 --> 01:06:22.800]
Hey, it's teams with all the legacy, Neil.

[01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:24.780]
You know, the likes of Detroit, Chicago, and Toronto.

[01:06:25.220 --> 01:06:27.440]
Who haven't won the Stanley Cup in 60 years?

[01:06:27.580 --> 01:06:28.720]
And some combined.

[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:32.720]
Yes, they'll be watching the Cinderella Panthers on TV or Denver.

[01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:34.360]
Mm-hmm.

[01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:38.160]
Well, somebody that sounds just like Jeff Moss and looks like

[01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:40.840]
I'm sent me over a facts here, gazing into a crystal puck.

[01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:42.880]
This was in a hockey news before the season started.

[01:06:43.460 --> 01:06:48.880]
And it's got 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 11, about 13 or 14 different so-called experts

[01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:51.720]
picking their, uh, their finishes in the two conferences.

[01:06:52.500 --> 01:06:55.720]
Nobody picked the panthers higher than 9th in the Eastern Conference.

[01:06:56.100 --> 01:06:59.780]
And nobody, of course, picked us to be in the finals, okay?

[01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:00.780]
Uh, let's see.

[01:07:00.900 --> 01:07:03.820]
I'll give you, I'll give you the picks for the Stanley Cup champion, okay?

[01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:05.340]
New Jersey, New Jersey.

[01:07:05.420 --> 01:07:07.000]
By the way, I think they missed a playoffs, didn't they?

[01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:11.340]
Philadelphia, New Jersey, New Jersey, New Jersey, Philadelphia, New Jersey, New Jersey, New Jersey,

[01:07:11.340 --> 01:07:13.600]
Detroit, Colorado, Pittsburgh, and Detroit.

[01:07:13.940 --> 01:07:14.880]
Or Philadelphia, Detroit.

[01:07:15.160 --> 01:07:18.720]
So in other words, there's only one out of 14 guys that picked either one of the teams

[01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:19.780]
that's in the finals, Colorado.

[01:07:19.780 --> 01:07:24.200]
That was Jim Kelly in the Buffalo News, which I'm sure is the writer and out the quarterback.

[01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:27.420]
Neil, I called you earlier this year before the playoffs started.

[01:07:27.580 --> 01:07:32.220]
And I boldly said the panthers are the most improved team in all four sports.

[01:07:32.360 --> 01:07:32.540]
Yeah.

[01:07:32.620 --> 01:07:36.300]
And you questioned that by calling me an obvious expert.

[01:07:36.660 --> 01:07:38.340]
Well, when was this?

[01:07:38.540 --> 01:07:38.540]

[01:07:38.720 --> 01:07:40.900]
Oh, it was before the playoffs started, okay?

[01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:44.760]
And, uh, you know, I got it on tape too, but never mind.

[01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:47.380]
But anyway, you call me an obvious expert.

[01:07:47.380 --> 01:07:48.580]
Do I get credit for that now?

[01:07:49.140 --> 01:07:49.820]
Yes, you do.

[01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:50.820]
Thank you, sir.

[01:07:51.060 --> 01:07:53.360]
Do I get credit for getting struck and woolly back in line up?

[01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:54.380]
Oh, of course you do.

[01:07:54.380 --> 01:07:54.760]
There you go.

[01:07:54.840 --> 01:07:55.440]
Okay, we're even.

[01:07:56.080 --> 01:07:56.920]
You and I, pal.

[01:07:57.720 --> 01:08:00.160]
I'll get you on the phone with me next time I'll have a conference call.

[01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:00.380]
Yes?

[01:08:00.740 --> 01:08:03.380]
Neil, I heard Billy Smith has been working with the Beezer.

[01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:04.520]
What do you know about that?

[01:08:05.260 --> 01:08:06.320]
Well, what do me has been working with?

[01:08:06.360 --> 01:08:07.420]
And he's the goalie coach.

[01:08:07.540 --> 01:08:09.340]
What do you, what do you, what do you, there he going?

[01:08:09.460 --> 01:08:10.520]
An obvious expert again.

[01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:13.820]
He's our goalie coach, pal, and has been for how long?

[01:08:13.960 --> 01:08:15.520]
For since the inception of the team.

[01:08:15.700 --> 01:08:16.140]
No kidding.

[01:08:16.140 --> 01:08:16.900]
You know, kidding.

[01:08:17.020 --> 01:08:17.480]
No crap.

[01:08:17.680 --> 01:08:20.140]
Well, they remind me of the New York Islanders in late 70s.

[01:08:20.140 --> 01:08:20.540]
There you go.

[01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:23.860]
And Bill Klai's where he dug out the old bow ties again from those days.

[01:08:23.880 --> 01:08:24.660]
Just for good luck.

[01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:28.760]
They had a lot of solid young labors who played defense along with great goals,

[01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:31.680]
tended in excellent coaching that made them the complete team.

[01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:34.200]
Probably Denise Pott fans advice that's putting us over the top.

[01:08:35.040 --> 01:08:35.760]
All right, sir.

[01:08:35.860 --> 01:08:36.420]
You have a great day.

[01:08:36.460 --> 01:08:37.120]
And back to you.

[01:08:37.180 --> 01:08:37.500]
Bye, bye.

[01:08:37.540 --> 01:08:38.920]
Left him almost speechless with that.

[01:08:39.360 --> 01:08:43.200]
Open line and date 7519463751

[01:08:44.140 --> 01:08:44.620]
WIOD.

[01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:45.560]
Here's Palm Beach.

[01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:45.820]
Hello.

[01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:48.240]
Neil Panthers.

[01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:48.980]
Yes, sir.

[01:08:49.100 --> 01:08:49.380]
A claim.

[01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:49.940]
God.

[01:08:50.280 --> 01:08:50.680]
That's us.

[01:08:51.100 --> 01:08:51.420]
All right.

[01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:53.280]
This is your buddy, the sign man.

[01:08:53.440 --> 01:08:54.240]
I made you a gift.

[01:08:55.140 --> 01:08:56.860]
Your own personal license plate.

[01:08:56.860 --> 01:08:57.880]
You can't get anywhere.

[01:08:58.640 --> 01:09:00.320]
I'd like to drop it off to you tomorrow.

[01:09:00.680 --> 01:09:00.940]
OK.

[01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:03.100]
You said we could.

[01:09:03.620 --> 01:09:08.740]
I've called the code text from the Harold five times.

[01:09:09.220 --> 01:09:12.480]
Every time I've called completely filled up his.

[01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:13.440]
All right.

[01:09:13.740 --> 01:09:14.140]
Nice.

[01:09:14.300 --> 01:09:14.700]
Nice.

[01:09:15.280 --> 01:09:16.680]
You can't even get through.

[01:09:16.840 --> 01:09:18.820]
So you know that the crown ball.

[01:09:19.020 --> 01:09:23.260]
That slime ball who's goes Cinderella lost his slipper and the ride is over.

[01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:24.760]
And it was nice while it lasted.

[01:09:25.060 --> 01:09:25.780]
And they've let it.

[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:29.500]
The thing that really pisses me off is he's like kind of saying, well,

[01:09:29.740 --> 01:09:32.840]
they choked, you know, like the Marlins have done this and the dolphins have

[01:09:32.840 --> 01:09:35.680]
done this and the heat against the bulls like they choked in it.

[01:09:35.740 --> 01:09:37.780]
You know, well, what kind of crap is that?

[01:09:37.880 --> 01:09:41.180]
You know, whoever expected us to get past the first round of the playoffs,

[01:09:41.180 --> 01:09:42.600]
they had to have their head examined.

[01:09:43.220 --> 01:09:45.480]
You remember when you were a kid waiting for a Christmas?

[01:09:45.880 --> 01:09:46.040]
Right.

[01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:51.400]
That's how I've been on Saturday all day waiting for Saturday night to watch a game.

[01:09:51.420 --> 01:09:53.080]
It's like so nervous.

[01:09:53.300 --> 01:09:54.360]
I can't wait to see it.

[01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:54.700]
Yeah.

[01:09:55.160 --> 01:09:57.380]
Anyways, can I put in a small plug?

[01:09:57.980 --> 01:09:59.660]
By the way, Mike Huff got I said it.

[01:09:59.660 --> 01:10:01.240]
I said it to Doug McLean.

[01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:02.020]
I want to say it again.

[01:10:02.060 --> 01:10:05.880]
Here's a guy that a lot of us, including me, thought was pretty washed up.

[01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:07.280]
And I mean, he's 33 years old.

[01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:08.580]
He's been a journeyman player.

[01:10:08.580 --> 01:10:09.880]
He had a tough season.

[01:10:09.900 --> 01:10:13.520]
He was like slow and all of a sudden, man, this guy's like flying.

[01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:14.960]
And here he gets on that three on one.

[01:10:15.020 --> 01:10:17.000]
And thank God it was failure there on the other end of that.

[01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:17.740]
The passing play.

[01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:18.140]
Beautiful.

[01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:19.480]
And back to Huff.

[01:10:19.500 --> 01:10:20.500]
And he sticks it right in there.

[01:10:20.500 --> 01:10:21.460]
That was just incredible.

[01:10:21.720 --> 01:10:22.300]
It was a great game.

[01:10:22.300 --> 01:10:24.480]
Mike Huff has been skating like wildfire in the series.

[01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:25.240]
Anyway, go ahead.

[01:10:25.340 --> 01:10:25.940]
Beautiful game.

[01:10:26.820 --> 01:10:31.660]
Anyways, I'd like to put in a plug to I would, you know, for a small fee,

[01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:35.220]
make anybody any type of custom license plate.

[01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:37.620]
They tell me what they want.

[01:10:37.620 --> 01:10:38.880]
And I could design it for them.

[01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:39.120]
OK.

[01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:40.480]
And I give you my number.

[01:10:40.540 --> 01:10:41.340]
Sure, absolutely.

[01:10:42.700 --> 01:10:45.540]
407, 795, 592, 6.

[01:10:45.800 --> 01:10:47.860]
That is the sign man of South Florida.

[01:10:48.660 --> 01:10:50.880]
407, 795, 592, 6.

[01:10:50.940 --> 01:10:52.540]
And I'll put on anything they want.

[01:10:52.820 --> 01:10:57.180]
Logos, rats, any type of lettering, their name, whatever.

[01:10:57.460 --> 01:10:58.900]
I've made you one for your vet.

[01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:00.280]
And I hope you use it.

[01:11:00.440 --> 01:11:00.700]
OK.

[01:11:00.860 --> 01:11:01.900]
And I'll drop it off tomorrow.

[01:11:02.060 --> 01:11:02.640]
Thanks a lot, Tom.

[01:11:02.780 --> 01:11:03.400]

As I said, she was boiling the water to wash clothes, which she does routinely and that's

Oh!

[01:14:30.920 --> 01:14:31.180]
Yes.

[01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:33.040]
That's your handy goal.

[01:14:33.660 --> 01:14:34.800]

You'll be coach of the year.

[01:14:46.220 --> 01:14:47.940]
Because it's true.

[01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:48.860]
Unbelabeled.

[01:14:48.980 --> 01:14:50.980]
You brought us all this way.

[01:14:51.180 --> 01:14:52.680]
Who knew?

[01:14:54.940 --> 01:14:56.220]
Oh, panthers.

Oh!

[01:15:08.340 --> 01:15:08.980]
Oh!

[01:15:10.100 --> 01:15:10.400]
Oh!

[01:15:11.860 --> 01:15:12.100]
Oh!

[01:15:12.280 --> 01:15:12.380]
Oh!

[01:15:12.820 --> 01:15:12.820]

[01:15:13.180 --> 01:15:13.360]
Oh!

[01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:13.360]

[01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:13.380]
Oh!

[01:15:13.380 --> 01:15:13.380]

[01:15:13.380 --> 01:15:13.380]

[01:15:13.420 --> 01:15:15.060]
Okay, 21-Till-Lew and a W-I-O-D.

[01:15:15.060 --> 01:15:16.280]
We'll see everybody's on the bandwagon.

[01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:17.980]
