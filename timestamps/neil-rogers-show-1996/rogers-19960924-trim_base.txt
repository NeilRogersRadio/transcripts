[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.220]
A better Rick and suds and nobody could even tell that he'd been there good job

[00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.420]
I said you know his motto ought to be hey. You'll never even know we were there being in charge of you though

[00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.700]
Did he he wanted to charge me three hundred and fifty dollars woo. Yeah exactly

[00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.140]
He got as much payment as your bounce check did

[00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.700]
So anyway, it's nine thirty seven at double imagine how right in the push they were at that bank yesterday when they look in the thing

[00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.140]
And they see not only it wasn't a hold put on it. It was just that's just

[00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:27.640]
There's a little bit of air there

[00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.120]
You know what I think that there was some malloc involved there

[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:37.360]
I mean what kind of a moron looks at a balance and sees over a hundred dollars more than the amount of the check and then says

[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.560]
Well, guess let's bounce the check somebody who's dealing with your money not their

[00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:47.020]
Yeah, that's when it becomes important. Okay, let's try we have open lines by the way in Broward 524 to WIO D and date

[00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.200]
7519 463 is that you I'm Kipper again. Let's try West Palm. Hello

[00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:54.880]
West Palm good morning

[00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.100]
Sure all right here's a mobile

[00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:00.940]
How's it going bank?

[00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:02.720]
bank suck

[00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.260]
There you go I was here

[00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.960]
I was like that other guy you've never paid attention to until I got a computer and started doing my my checking on quick

[00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:17.320]
And I was just telling Neil that in a great you just press weapon style you enter your balance

[00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.520]
Five minutes by me you'll catch a penny

[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.860]
You know and I everyone I caught was the bank right and it's always a

[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:30.100]
Their favor whoever you're paying it's always in their favor because somebody don't read too well right and

[00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.800]
It is guy says he don't care why I added up even in smallmouth they was twenty bucks

[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.340]
You know you took a twenty dollar bill up if you got it laying on the road

[00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.720]
But you see he writes it off to he don't care about 50 cents which is fine

[00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:47.420]
But he doesn't know if it's fifty dollars because if you don't balance how you gonna know if it's 50 cents or 500 bucks

[00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:53.740]
Exactly so you know you sure you can just for sake of argument say all I'm not gonna worry over 50 cents because I'm a hot shot

[00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.960]
But you don't know what it is if you don't open up the statement and then like they did to Neil there

[00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:04.220]
You know then you end up with that thirty dollars thirty dollars twenty seven dollars early service fees and it's just a bunch of bs

[00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.360]
Well, you know sometimes it takes something to get your attention

[00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:13.100]
You realize how many mistakes you know the ineptitude of the people who are doing this they I don't know if I could do that

[00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:19.020]
Anyway to to be like a data entry person to sit there looking all those checks day after day all you do eight hours a day

[00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.820]
What the fact is they make a tremendous amount of money but you're one

[00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:27.040]
Well, I mean you know you know you have a computer how many times you hit the wrong key all of them you know yeah

[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:35.820]
Yeah, I listen to acronym for the date dolphins Dan's other leg put hopper in Nirvana good bye

[00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.260]
What do you do with the s? Let's go to Miami. Hello

[00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.760]
Rick and Pfff. Oh, it's back at you. Hey, what do you guys know about this real audio on the internet?

[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.860]
And it sucks. It sounds like really really crappy AM radio

[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:57.940]
That's that's the state of the art so we are gonna have it starting soon. Yeah, well, I've heard something that doesn't sound too bad

[00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:06.740]
What is too bad? I mean it sounds like it sounds normal. I've heard other radio stations. Yeah, it's that's what I've garbled it's

[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.080]
We're on whose computer you heard it on done matter you don't have one

[00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:15.580]
You don't have one

[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.040]
Don't start giving me these looks like you have one you have a computer I

[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.700]
Said I've heard it well. Thank you. Me an answer who's computer?

[00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:31.240]
You're making difference. I've used real audio the program that's out right now and it sounds like crap

[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:39.720]
How about your song that sounds like crap? I've heard I've never listened to that I wave also we're now we're on I wave

[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:46.620]
Our ROM and Adam says that sucks. Yeah, well guys. I was listening to Steve nickel on friday

[00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.300]
Mm-hmm, and he said your station was gonna be on it

[00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.500]
But he also said that Phil Henry

[00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:59.620]
They might time will cast a show from midnight to three out here and that he's talking to Phil's agent and to Phil about possibly doing that

[00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:05.160]
Carrying the show live in other words. It's nine to midnight out there. It'll be 12 to three here. Yeah, he said that

[00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:11.420]
The PD did yeah, oh, I don't know if he was drunk. I ran a

[00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:16.980]
Ran ran into an interesting home page is called the Steve nickel sucks home page. Have you seen that?

[00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.560]
Have you seen the nickel delusions of fantasy home page?

[00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:22.940]
It's on air somebody I'm Tony

[00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.300]
You know, don't you think it would be a lot easier seriously with all due respect to Phil wouldn't be a lot easier

[00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:33.600]
If Steve got in the back of like in the trunk. Yeah, you know, just got a bottle got in the trunk with some ear holes

[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.280]
Yeah, and Phil drove him out there with him and he could be the PD of KFI from nine to midnight

[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.460]
I think I had no seriously. I think I had the right solution for the whole dealer

[00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:49.180]
Because he is just he'll never be the same now so the show is going indicate into syndication before it ever starts right okay

[00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.860]
I'm logical to me fact right now tonight. We're gonna be carrying it even though it's not on

[00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:55.540]
The pot

[00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.860]
It would still be better than that sports crap

[00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:03.140]
We got all you do is imagine how great it would be from midnight to three

[00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:08.480]
Well, he said today was the due day whether he's gonna stay with with Paxen or not who?

[00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:10.000]
Steve nickel

[00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:14.160]
Whether who's gonna stay with Paxen on him? Oh

[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.220]
Today, why did you say all this? How the hell how let me you know?

[00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:21.240]
It's really interesting that he goes on the year Sunday morning and tells the audience all this stuff

[00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.400]
But none of us know anything about this

[00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:31.220]
Today is the D day is to whether he's gonna be the PD or not that's what he said how come we don't know that he's gonna decide whether he wants

[00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:32.180]
He's gonna decide

[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:33.840]
Yeah

[00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:41.320]
As he come in yet, don't you think it's a little cutting it a little bit close to the bone I do

[00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:44.080]
Is he there yet at the end of the building?

[00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:49.840]
We haven't checked the floors on the hallways. You still got almost a week. Yeah, as he dragged in yet

[00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:53.560]
And of course, let me also tell you since you brought this good news up

[00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:57.400]
We were just lamenting during the last break that like sports talk

[00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:00.820]
We don't have any idea if D.F.O. Stinger going to Q.A. M

[00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:03.900]
So we have no idea who's doing sports talk eight to midnight

[00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:08.700]
He's allegedly bringing some guy. I don't know if he's bringing this guy from Vegas in that he was talking about or who it is

[00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:13.220]
We've got somebody new coming on, but we don't know who it is or what they do or anything about him

[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:18.020]
Overnight we have no clue whether it's gonna still be this a Ron bar sport

[00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:23.700]
We don't have any idea what's gonna be on like half the broadcast day and he said to sail my go through Friday

[00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:28.760]
So that's what three days away. It's supposed to go through Friday. It will go through Friday. Oh, it is

[00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:30.360]
Yeah, yeah

[00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:36.620]
The 30th I mean the 30th is when they take over Friday it goes through the 27th right as of the 30th we will be back soon

[00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:42.160]
Good luck guys. You need it. Oh, okay. Thank you. Thanks for the good news

[00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:47.340]
Just click your hill. Let's see we're having their caring Phil from what from 6 a.m. To midnight 6 a.m. To 6 a.m.

[00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:50.480]
It's gonna they're gonna bring her back right out of the bay. They're gonna fish her ass

[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:56.580]
Yeah, he's dead for his four hours, right? And then they're gonna bring back what's his name my the payroll Earl pants

[00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:58.620]
Yeah, Earl Garner and Earl Pants

[00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:03.020]
I'm getting misty just thinking about it. Well why why does Phil even have to go?

[00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:08.220]
Why can't he just stay here instead of relocating and do the show from here and Simon cast it out to KFI rather than going to KFI

[00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:11.100]
That's right here except I think he'd rather be out there

[00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:12.700]
What

[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:15.540]
Wouldn't you

[00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:22.500]
Would you call me do you let's go to a mobile hello? Yes morning

[00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:23.200]
Morning

[00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:30.800]
Yeah, I got a bank story for you of knock you out of your socks. Yeah, not wearing any so

[00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:38.500]
Went to the bank to check the balance on my account about two months ago. I had $3,647

[00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:41.820]
More money in my account than I was supposed to

[00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:46.460]
Congratulations, and I walked up to the color and I said there's a mistake in my account

[00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:49.300]
And I'd like to get a correct it where you have to go see the manager

[00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:51.120]
So I went over to this young man

[00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:56.320]
And he said yep, you're absolutely right and I said well, I'd like to get it withdrawn

[00:07:56.760 --> 00:08:00.000]
Because I know if I if I spend it you're gonna come and put the in jail

[00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:04.940]
So he said well, we got to go through a procedure. Can you come back tomorrow?

[00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:09.300]
And I said sure it's not convenient, but I'll do it. I

[00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:12.300]
Went home. What was the procedure? Why did you have to come back tomorrow?

[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:19.280]
I don't know

[00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:24.380]
I had to come back from Moscow your account was impacted. It was rectal surgery as far as I was right anyway

[00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:33.020]
I go on that night the next day I go back to the bank and the guy says oh I want to talk to you about the two-bounce checks you have

[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:40.840]
And I said how can I have two-bounce checks? I've never written a check for more than my written my mortgage payment

[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:45.700]
I only write six or seven checks a month and I've got seven or eight thousand dollars

[00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:49.680]
And I account besides the 3647 dollars you mistakenly put in there

[00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:53.700]
He said we froze your account so the checks bounced

[00:08:54.480 --> 00:09:01.000]
Now your account's gonna remain closed this is what he had to do as they froze the account the amount you really had in

[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:07.620]
Plus the 3600 which is there because of their mistake because of their mistake. Oh, what bank was this?

[00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:14.000]
All right, so I I went to the guy go back to the bank and I said to the guy

[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.800]
Well, do you think it would be well they would now be they were protecting you though the fact I have an excellent credit record

[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:19.920]
I've never asked to check

[00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:25.620]
You know what what happens if more money came into your account or something that account wasn't frozen

[00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:31.000]
I'm going to prison. I think yeah, there's anyway the end result was I asked him if they would write a letter to the two-bounce

[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.020]
The checks were bounced off. Yeah, and

[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000]
Explained that it was their problem. They said yes, they would take care of it immediately

[00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:42.700]
That's two and a half months ago. I've been to the bank four times and now that computer won't write that letter

[00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:48.780]
Immediately is a figure of speech in the banking industry sir immediately is a lifetime that way you know you got it

[00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:53.060]
That's the figure of speech so they're not gonna write what do you mean the computer was frozen? They're not gonna write the letter

[00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:54.120]
up punchline

[00:09:54.880 --> 00:10:01.480]
After this was all over my account was opened up. Yeah, 10 days later. I still have the 3645 dollars my

[00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:04.580]
So my

[00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:10.460]
Companions that work decided I should write a check for that amount. I agree. Yeah, I think out there right

[00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:13.740]
So I wrote a check but I went to the bank to cash it

[00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:18.900]
I know the man at the bank the same guy been talking to all the time. Here's my check

[00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:22.480]
I'm gonna cash it. I'm gonna take this cash and I'm gonna walk out of the bank and I'm gonna keep it

[00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:26.780]
You should know to back you at time and he says you can't do that. It's illegal

[00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:33.960]
It's your money. Yeah, guess what my account was all straight now in about 37 seconds

[00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:35.980]
You didn't have to go home wait a day, huh?

[00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:39.520]
I love it. I'll freeze anything on your own. I would

[00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:45.880]
That's the only bad thing guys. I wouldn't hook my computer up to a bank for anything. I

[00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:50.540]
Don't trust them my computer is not hooked up to a bank at all. I hope so no

[00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:56.060]
It's but I still pay all my checks and everything electronically by a third party a third party

[00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:59.620]
I will guarantee you someday they'll dream up a way to clean out your accounts

[00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:02.780]
I don't every check you've gotten you have to live with studs

[00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:07.360]
I'm taking I'm I'm I'm plugging it this afternoon pal. Thank you

[00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:10.600]
947 if we take it a break you see where his mistake was

[00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:14.600]
Why did he have to be he still wanted to be so honest? Why do you go back in telecon?

[00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:17.520]
He was he was honest just write the chair. Well, he was afraid of going to jail

[00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:20.420]
Oh, is that he know it whenever it's in your favor. You got to go to jail

[00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:26.620]
It'll never come out and only person that I have ever known for a favor to come out in his favor forever is such Coleman

[00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:31.060]
He bought a little walk. He bought an entertainment center from Levitt's they never built him

[00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:35.380]
He made one payment. They never build him. It was like $15,000. He paid a

[00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:37.460]
142 dollars on it and that was about it

[00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:40.640]
Ten years ago, right? Oh at least yeah

[00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:47.020]
Now he's the only guy I've mentioned on the air you think Levitt's may go back in there look for a Coleman a suds a

[00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:49.440]
Cellburn something yeah, well forget it

[00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:56.180]
He's the only one to ever walk from so everybody else goes to jail and that's what this guy was afraid of so he was just covering his own butt

[00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:03.420]
Anyway, leave it to Levitt's 941 it or 948 it don't look at that. We just gave you seven minutes. There's your interest

[00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:05.580]
For bad guys

[00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:13.540]
When you talk live on 610 W IOD you'll be recording and we'll play the tape back whenever we feel like it

[00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:17.960]
952 at W IOD eight in front of 10 o'clock. So let me ask you this question

[00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:24.060]
Since it's no seriously, this is mind-boggling. We are we're stuck and we only find out stuff from the audience

[00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:27.120]
Thank God at least for a few of those bastards out there that we get little

[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:31.140]
Drips and drabs of stuff that's going on because nobody talks to us most of the time and

[00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:38.240]
Supposed he decides well the booze a good air anymore or something or I can't get Phil's show on overnight so I'm not staying

[00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:43.520]
Who's the PD then who's gonna be in charge of this? Adam Adam. I'm gonna do it

[00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:49.360]
Do you recall we didn't have a PD for some time and we were we did pretty good well in between

[00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:54.500]
Yeah, exactly like things went up and we're pretty successful

[00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:57.920]
Let's go to my own the long. Yeah

[00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:07.480]
Miami Beach 4.1 of the morning show I remember good morning. Yeah, long morning. I am a listener. Yeah, I need to ask you a question

[00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:12.680]
Well, we are the host maybe we are the host so we must answer these questions

[00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:18.360]
I may I realize that you can't have a show like yours without defending somebody that we offended you

[00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:24.040]
Yeah, oh good. Thank you. Okay. I hope I can return the favor sure

[00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:25.520]
You know

[00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:31.400]
To statements like professional Jew and young Kippur. There are things that are holy to us

[00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:34.700]
Yeah, I really think that you need to ease up with it wrong

[00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:38.240]
Row wrong well from a low life you like you I can

[00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:40.720]
Oh, yeah low life because I don't agree with you

[00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:43.320]
I don't run a show that but wait a minute

[00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:45.100]
So it's okay for you to call me a low life

[00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:47.780]
I thought I make fun of silly old holidays

[00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:53.600]
The only thing I call you a low life for is for making statements like that what you decide to do with your life is your business

[00:13:53.600 --> 00:14:00.300]
Oh really I don't find you wrong or right or anything else. Yeah, thank God for the rest of us who feel that this is our way of life

[00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:05.220]
You know something there's 80's Zillion religious shows on all over TV and radio

[00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:09.140]
When somebody comes on welcome you don't want to let me say anything

[00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:14.320]
Why don't you just say it the way it is if you have somebody to make the way it is but you just keep talking

[00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:17.260]
You don't want to do it anyway. You're used to having taken a breath

[00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:21.100]
I think probably I think probably yesterday the fast is

[00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:26.100]
Probably your way you're trying to make up for it now probably to low life like you yeah low life there

[00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:28.600]
We go again. Why don't you go to the way you go to the wall and

[00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:35.860]
Okay, why don't you rock it rock back and forth at the way like you go to Jerusalem with the Arabs there puts a

[00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:39.400]
Shmata's on okay, and why don't you go yank your sisters while you're at it?

[00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:43.120]

Okay, that's not about Bernie Koso are by the way

[00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:14.730]
It's 10.08 at W.O.D. Good morning to you happy Tuesday tough game last night tough game and let me say it again

[00:21:14.730 --> 00:21:20.330]
I'm seeing a little bit of some of the stuff we've seen in the past neurotic repetition over and over and over again

[00:21:21.050 --> 00:21:24.950]
Danny gets hurt we bring in Bernie who just came from the girl school and

[00:21:26.150 --> 00:21:32.750]
There's starting to blitz on every play how come it is that the cults kept running the draw play over and over and over and over and over again last night

[00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:35.590]
And anytime they felt like it and they pick up 10 15

[00:21:36.050 --> 00:21:37.670]
12 yards over and over again

[00:21:37.670 --> 00:21:42.590]
I don't think we've dropped stop their drop play once last night and yet in the fourth quarter when we're still

[00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:47.110]
Miraculously still in a game in spite of the fact that Nudnik missed another field goal

[00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:51.010]
We're still in a game and the Bernie's back they're getting creamed

[00:21:51.010 --> 00:21:55.290]
I mean their blitz and they're coming in I mean isn't got a chance they're turning them into a Thanksgiving wishbone

[00:21:55.930 --> 00:21:58.890]
And we don't do anything different nothing we don't run a draw play

[00:21:58.890 --> 00:22:03.470]
We don't throw a little screen pass except there at the end which Abdul Abdul Schwartz there Karim

[00:22:03.890 --> 00:22:05.270]
Says oops sorry

[00:22:06.370 --> 00:22:11.030]
It hit him in a bad place as usual and that would have been the first down and who knows they might still be playing at this point

[00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:13.130]
But it's one of those there was a tough night

[00:22:13.130 --> 00:22:17.150]
But sooner later we were gonna lose one and that damn Jim Harbour had to be the one to beat us

[00:22:17.150 --> 00:22:21.690]
But what he makes me sick to my stomach. I just get oh God. Why hate him?

[00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:24.410]
Is this Ann still on here by the any chance? Hello?

[00:22:24.490 --> 00:22:26.570]
Hi Neil. Hi here. It's still is Ann. Well, thank God I remembered

[00:22:27.210 --> 00:22:32.590]
Thank you. I have a bank horror story for you. Yeah back several years ago when I was working for the federal court

[00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:35.350]
So it was a student employee so I was considered self-employed

[00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:38.410]
So I had to pay my tax income tax quarterly right well

[00:22:38.410 --> 00:22:42.790]
I went ahead and got my income tax return in I was supposed to get back a little over a thousand dollars

[00:22:43.290 --> 00:22:49.290]
I get my income tax check back my refund check back and it's four hundred dollars and some odd sense, you know

[00:22:50.050 --> 00:22:52.790]
and I went back to my tax people agent our block and

[00:22:53.970 --> 00:22:59.610]
I said to him what's the problem with the lady looked back over my checks and it turns out that my bank had only paid

[00:22:59.610 --> 00:23:04.830]
The government where they were supposed to pay him seven hundred and fifty six dollars. They only paid the bank the government

[00:23:05.670 --> 00:23:09.930]
156 dollars nice only six hundred short right so they six hundred dollars short of the government

[00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:13.630]
Well the government made up for it out of my income refunds. There no problem with that

[00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:20.230]
I went to the bank the next day and I said to them what all I want from you is a letter stating that this was not my screw up

[00:23:20.230 --> 00:23:25.030]
It was yours to check with plainly written it was legible. There was no questions of it

[00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:28.870]
Just go ahead get me this letter. So if I get audited. It's not you know

[00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:32.230]
I'm not responsible for this. It was your screw up. Oh no problem

[00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:36.130]
But for deposited my page my income tax check that day

[00:23:36.130 --> 00:23:39.130]
Few days later I'm in the bank with my mom and I said to her look

[00:23:39.130 --> 00:23:43.690]
I'm gonna put in a few dollars so I get it up over my balance up over five hundred dollars to draw some interest

[00:23:43.690 --> 00:23:44.470]
She's okay

[00:23:45.270 --> 00:23:50.870]
So I'm in line and I asked the lady. I don't know what made me ask the lady for a balance when she did the deposit

[00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:54.630]
Yeah, you still owe us a hundred and four dollars

[00:23:55.450 --> 00:23:58.870]
And I went what they heard me all over the bank

[00:24:00.050 --> 00:24:04.170]
What turned out is that the bank without my knowledge or my permission

[00:24:04.170 --> 00:24:08.230]
With through six hundred dollars from my checking account and sent it to the federal government

[00:24:11.910 --> 00:24:15.070]
Unbelievable can you believe that which bank was this city bank?

[00:24:17.290 --> 00:24:22.370]
I will gladly tell you tell the world it was city bank. I think you left the H out yet really

[00:24:23.210 --> 00:24:23.690]
Wow

[00:24:24.270 --> 00:24:29.970]
A few weeks later I get my six hundred dollars plus interest back from the federal government. Yeah, which is great

[00:24:30.630 --> 00:24:35.090]
Ask me did I ever get a letter of apology or we're sorry or anything from the bank?

[00:24:35.730 --> 00:24:38.930]
The answer to the question is new. I did not unbelievable

[00:24:40.110 --> 00:24:45.510]
Nice, but they did I think they say themselves a lawsuit they didn't charge me a service charge for like two years

[00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:52.150]
So I kind of lucked out they all suck. They all suck. It's hopeless. It's hopeless

[00:24:52.150 --> 00:24:54.970]
When I when I finished this story up from what happened yesterday

[00:24:54.970 --> 00:24:58.990]
It's gonna make the previous days seem like a child's play. It's unbelievable

[00:24:58.990 --> 00:24:59.810]
I

[00:24:59.810 --> 00:25:04.430]
Was ready to call in I mean I'm sitting there looking on their computer screen

[00:25:05.410 --> 00:25:10.630]
While they're back in the room hockin a china with each other trying to figure to save push and I'm looking

[00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:15.490]
I can see like 16 lines you know from the ledger and my account for the marmos stakes

[00:25:16.050 --> 00:25:18.710]
Now if that's if they made four mistakes in

[00:25:19.330 --> 00:25:24.950]
One account in 16 lines you can imagine multiply at times the thousands and thousands of customers

[00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:30.090]
They have an it's one branch times the millions of customers they have around the country and it's a nice way to make a living

[00:25:30.090 --> 00:25:32.370]
You know, it's no wonder they're the biggest bank right?

[00:25:33.370 --> 00:25:38.510]
That's what I said. I said why I'm in a wrong racket. I beat buying up all the other banks too if I was ripping everybody off like this

[00:25:40.210 --> 00:25:40.570]
It's

[00:25:41.550 --> 00:25:45.910]
Jesse James isn't dead. He's gone into the banking business. Okay, sweetheart. I'll see you in raford

[00:25:45.910 --> 00:25:52.110]
And take care. Bye. Bye. Yeah, we're all going to jail because the banks are gonna put us there this this story yesterday

[00:25:52.610 --> 00:25:57.350]
And I sure hope that my good friend Kimberly is back from young kipper yesterday. Hope she didn't eat anything

[00:25:58.070 --> 00:26:02.770]
Because she has a lot to be forgiven for I'll tell you that these are nothing so over there at Haitian's bank

[00:26:02.770 --> 00:26:04.210]
Oh, the story gets even better

[00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:11.750]
It's 12 minutes after 10 at WIOD, you know long as it been since radio's bad boys were on the air in South Florida

[00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:19.990]
Too long and that's why they're back run and run mornings Monday September 30th on news talk and entertainment radio

[00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:22.270]
610 W I

[00:26:22.270 --> 00:26:23.490]
Oh, the

[00:26:24.630 --> 00:26:25.810]
Tank Goldberg

[00:26:25.810 --> 00:26:33.750]
Okay, 1016 at WIOD thanks to Lin at Kaiser and Blair Inc and they make

[00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:39.090]
T-shirts and caps and all kinds of good stuff. She sends me a lovely t-shirt. Thank you, Lin

[00:26:39.090 --> 00:26:46.730]
It says hurricane tracking chart and it's an orange and green no less is that interesting as in hurricane colors and

[00:26:47.670 --> 00:26:48.730]
It's got a map of

[00:26:50.590 --> 00:26:55.530]
What is the map of is it a map of Miami? Is it a map of the world? It's just a general map and

[00:26:56.530 --> 00:27:02.410]
It shows Miami and it's got all the various heracune who've had the suspensions and got a jail and are

[00:27:02.970 --> 00:27:09.370]
Way awaiting suspended indefinitely here's one pending no contest and there's one two three four five six seven on

[00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:11.910]
The front and on the back

[00:27:12.730 --> 00:27:14.050]
And even seen the back yet

[00:27:15.850 --> 00:27:17.650]
On the back it says

[00:27:21.570 --> 00:27:29.390]
Dedicated to hurricane center terms tropical storm hurricane watch hurricane warning misdemeanor felony probation domestic violence bad publicity

[00:27:29.390 --> 00:27:37.350]
No contest suspension NCAA investigation scholarship reduction. Oh, all right. Thank you Lin beautiful. We're with the great pride

[00:27:38.790 --> 00:27:43.310]
So anyway getting back to this thing yesterday at the bank so after my four-hour tirade yesterday

[00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:47.530]
I go over there. I drive into the bank. I walk in the door. I sit down

[00:27:47.530 --> 00:27:52.270]
I put my name you know how they have the little thing there the clipboard and you may put your name on a list to see

[00:27:52.270 --> 00:27:56.410]
Somebody who's a hot shot so I put my name on a list and I'm sitting there a couple of minutes

[00:27:56.410 --> 00:28:02.130]
I noticed that people are looking like the tellers are looking at each other very kind of like tense and there's almost nobody in there

[00:28:02.130 --> 00:28:04.530]
Damn it so I couldn't put on a big show and jump up and down and

[00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:09.550]
So eventually this guy who's very nice guy who's there only from another branch filling in

[00:28:09.550 --> 00:28:13.150]
I guess for Kimberly yesterday because it was yum kipper and guys like this

[00:28:13.150 --> 00:28:16.790]
Orthodox jackass that called before that low-life scumbag that called Rick

[00:28:16.790 --> 00:28:20.690]
They were like busy fasting and whatever and getting upset because I was making fun of it

[00:28:20.690 --> 00:28:23.330]
So anyway, I Kimberly wasn't there so this guy sitting in

[00:28:24.430 --> 00:28:26.750]
So he asked what he can do for me and blah blah blah

[00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:31.050]
I tell him and I've got this check and a bounce the check and the out of yada whatever else and what's the problem here

[00:28:31.050 --> 00:28:34.550]
So now the head teller my good friend gadget comes over

[00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:36.110]
Gidget goes Hawaiian

[00:28:37.310 --> 00:28:41.450]
And we start looking at the problem and of course they know there's an ongoing problem

[00:28:41.450 --> 00:28:46.430]
They know that there's been four hours of a vicious attacks and rightfully so on a year and they're very defensive and red in the face

[00:28:46.430 --> 00:28:48.830]
And we look at a computer on a computer screen

[00:28:50.530 --> 00:28:55.910]
Now meanwhile this guy and Gidget go back into the office for a second or two to make a phone call to one of the

[00:28:56.670 --> 00:28:59.010]
Bank hot shots that they've been on a phone with all day

[00:28:59.010 --> 00:29:02.810]
I guess to try to get this to the bottom of this mess why they're so inept

[00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:06.470]
So I'm sitting there and I'm looking at the computer screen and it's got like

[00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:09.290]
12 or I would say 15 lines

[00:29:09.770 --> 00:29:14.410]
From the ledger of this one account of my business account and as I'm looking at the lines

[00:29:14.410 --> 00:29:18.830]
First of all I look and here's a balance of $8,123

[00:29:19.610 --> 00:29:23.370]
Before the $8,000 check came in are you following me?

[00:29:23.710 --> 00:29:26.870]
$8,123 is the balance the check is 8,000 they bounce it

[00:29:27.410 --> 00:29:30.670]
There was no whole place done the deposit they just bounced it

[00:29:32.850 --> 00:29:36.090]
Then of course after that there's the $27 fee for the

[00:29:36.830 --> 00:29:42.430]
Insufficient funds another mistake that's mistake number two and as I'm glancing up and down this column

[00:29:42.430 --> 00:29:47.430]
I see two of my tax payments which end in 50 cents. They're all the same every week

[00:29:47.430 --> 00:29:52.970]
Okay, the same amount it ends in 50 cents to the IRS which I make to the bank and they pay the IRS

[00:29:54.270 --> 00:29:59.250]
The I see one of them on there with the 50 cents the next two that are on there are like zero zero

[00:29:59.910 --> 00:30:04.470]
Not to the next highest dollar the next lowest dollar in the banks for so here's a dollar now granted

[00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:08.110]
It's only a dollar that's missing which I'm not that concerned about as the 8,000

[00:30:09.550 --> 00:30:14.410]
But here's another dollar just in 16 lines out of the four mistakes that I see there in the 16 lines

[00:30:14.410 --> 00:30:16.830]
Here's another dollar that they ripped off from me and

[00:30:18.670 --> 00:30:24.570]
They can't figure out why oh, I don't know where we dropped that 50 cents and I said the 50 cents isn't really a big deal

[00:30:24.570 --> 00:30:26.630]
Even though the federal government might not like it too much

[00:30:26.630 --> 00:30:32.130]
But when you multiply 50 cents times however many customers you people are got it starts adding up to some serious money

[00:30:33.770 --> 00:30:36.070]
So to make a long story short after being in the bank

[00:30:36.590 --> 00:30:39.170]
Gidgets is okay do this and this is the way we're gonna solve it

[00:30:39.170 --> 00:30:44.050]
We got a we got a system set up and see me and I'll take care of Bob Bob. We're gonna have a discussion

[00:30:44.050 --> 00:30:50.350]
Okay, so I go with a straight not all the charges. It was their mistake. It was it was it's unconscionable

[00:30:52.810 --> 00:30:56.190]
$123 more than the amount of the check and they bounced the check

[00:30:56.590 --> 00:30:59.510]
So I go home assuming all is right with the world okay?

[00:30:59.510 --> 00:31:03.730]
I feed my dogs. I take the mail out of the mailbox. I'm sitting down going through the mail

[00:31:05.150 --> 00:31:05.510]
I

[00:31:05.510 --> 00:31:08.590]
Don't want to tell you where I was sitting going through the mail. I left the H out

[00:31:08.590 --> 00:31:12.010]
That's right. I was sitting there on the throne going through the mail

[00:31:12.010 --> 00:31:15.070]
That's a good place to do it something interesting to read all of a sudden wow

[00:31:16.470 --> 00:31:22.370]
Urgency really helped to speed up the process. I'll tell you that because here's another one of these tell tail envelopes from nations bank

[00:31:22.370 --> 00:31:25.490]
Regional Center in Tampa. I said, oh wait a minute. This can't be

[00:31:26.630 --> 00:31:31.630]
Because I've had them reinstore you know put the 8000 back in my personal account when I was in the bank

[00:31:31.630 --> 00:31:33.850]
But in the meantime too late I

[00:31:35.090 --> 00:31:40.730]
Opened this up and on your personal account number so and so items presented for payment on the 19th of September

[00:31:41.270 --> 00:31:46.010]
Check number so and so here's four of them that were paid but overdrawn so

[00:31:46.010 --> 00:31:49.310]
$27 fee charged they were nice enough to pay these small ones

[00:31:49.310 --> 00:31:53.250]
But they charged me a $27 fee which one of the checks was for like 60 bucks

[00:31:53.250 --> 00:31:56.590]
But a $27 fee then here's another one check number so and so

[00:31:57.450 --> 00:32:03.690]
$600 return in sufficient funds another $27 fee which happens to have been a check to norm cat for legal fees my attorney

[00:32:05.470 --> 00:32:08.170]
Which thank God it was to him and nobody else like somebody important

[00:32:10.450 --> 00:32:16.710]
So needless to say I'm back on the phone and I'm now starting to get really agitated aggravated while I was in the bank

[00:32:16.710 --> 00:32:19.130]
I mean what's the point of screaming and yelling? It's not gonna do any good

[00:32:19.130 --> 00:32:23.690]
I've done four hours on here, but now that I'm into this and I'm saying how can this be possible?

[00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:26.110]
How can there be so many stupid people there?

[00:32:27.350 --> 00:32:32.850]
And of course she's practically peeing in her pants because she knows that the it's just oh it's like the domino effect

[00:32:32.850 --> 00:32:34.990]
I said that's right like the fat stomino effect

[00:32:38.230 --> 00:32:43.570]
Just one mistake leading to another and another and of course I'm the one it's oh well baby glad to write a letter to

[00:32:43.570 --> 00:32:47.590]
Mr. Kent I said yeah right right a letter to Mr. Kent right a letter Maria

[00:32:49.830 --> 00:32:54.130]
And so this is where we are today and they're having another meeting and Kimberly is coming back from your kipper

[00:32:54.130 --> 00:32:56.830]
And I hope they have a wonderful life together and in the meantime

[00:32:56.830 --> 00:33:00.590]
I'm thinking of you know as I'm driving up to the bank yesterday after doing this show

[00:33:01.710 --> 00:33:04.470]
You know, I'm thinking naturally I'm gonna go over to that family bank

[00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:05.690]
I'm gonna close my account

[00:33:05.690 --> 00:33:12.190]
But in the meantime that it dawns on me. I've got thousands of checks thousands literally because I got that new

[00:33:12.190 --> 00:33:16.250]
laser printer from my computer thousands of checks on their bank

[00:33:17.710 --> 00:33:24.230]
Personalized that I'm gonna I'm not gonna wind up eating those in addition to which next week or whenever it's gonna be eventually

[00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:28.830]
We're gonna be paid by Paxon or switching over that whole system, which I don't even know how that's gonna work yet

[00:33:29.450 --> 00:33:34.750]
So now is probably not the most propitious and convenient time for me to be switching banks

[00:33:35.690 --> 00:33:36.170]
unfortunately

[00:33:37.210 --> 00:33:42.710]
So I'm sitting here still at the mercy of my good close personal friends at Haitians bank waiting for them to see if they can get

[00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:46.850]
They're act together and just like Rick told that one bonehead out there who didn't want to listen

[00:33:46.850 --> 00:33:49.250]
Oh, what's 50 cents? Well, if you feel like getting it

[00:33:49.250 --> 00:33:52.950]
Maybe it's not 50 cents. Maybe it's 50 bucks. Maybe it's a buck here. Maybe it's a buck there

[00:33:52.950 --> 00:33:56.770]
Maybe the course of it you're it adds up to 100 or 200 or 500 or whatever it might be

[00:33:57.990 --> 00:34:00.870]
So if you're another one of these people at trust your bank and never looks at your

[00:34:01.270 --> 00:34:06.010]
Establish and figures all you know, they got all our computers. They everything they got to have is right right

[00:34:06.770 --> 00:34:07.130]
Right

[00:34:07.710 --> 00:34:12.550]
You sit there and you look at that thing and you wonder what kind of a child what kind of a moron

[00:34:12.710 --> 00:34:20.330]
Can look at that screen and see a check comes in to be paid for eight thousand dollars. There's 8123 all insufficient funds

[00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:26.490]
Seriously, what kind of an education you have to have a kindergarten education to get that far or what

[00:34:27.530 --> 00:34:30.330]
All I can say is unbelievable pathetic

[00:34:32.010 --> 00:34:32.970]
1024 wiod

[00:34:33.670 --> 00:34:35.610]
Use talking entertainment radio

[00:34:38.030 --> 00:34:38.990]
610 wiod

[00:34:40.030 --> 00:34:43.010]
Gary Bruce tied to the track in front of a freight train

[00:34:43.010 --> 00:34:46.190]
1028 at wiod is the beat goes on so we're just

[00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:50.070]
And you know, I was trying was I was sitting there waiting for this guy to bank yesterday

[00:34:50.070 --> 00:34:53.490]
I'm putting together in my mind. At first it was people's bank of ilya

[00:34:53.950 --> 00:34:54.850]
then it became

[00:34:56.170 --> 00:34:56.570]
CNS

[00:34:56.990 --> 00:34:59.390]
Or was it the other way around was it NCMB first?

[00:35:01.050 --> 00:35:05.610]
I think NCMB and CNS co-existed, but one of them devoured the other or something

[00:35:05.610 --> 00:35:10.330]
Right, but I think it was NCMB from boy did I have problems with that that's when the trouble started

[00:35:10.330 --> 00:35:17.370]
Then it became CNS and then nations bank gobbled up CNS and they vanished and now we're where we are here today with Haitians bank

[00:35:18.050 --> 00:35:20.450]
Here's coil springs on a purple line. Hello

[00:35:20.450 --> 00:35:22.350]
Neil yes, sir. Hey, how you doing today? Okay?

[00:35:22.530 --> 00:35:29.530]
I loved the show. I just wanted to my heard yesterday dog in Haitians bank. I was I was loving it because I had problems when I first moved down here with

[00:35:29.530 --> 00:35:32.350]
I mean, I thought I was the only one that was having problems with them

[00:35:32.350 --> 00:35:35.330]
I mean they must hire the most stupid people on the face of the earth because

[00:35:35.330 --> 00:35:38.530]
The kind of mistakes that they make it just so

[00:35:39.770 --> 00:35:44.510]
Unconsciously, I've never had I've never had a problem with any banks before until until I came down here

[00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:44.930]
Yeah

[00:35:44.930 --> 00:35:46.710]
Well, what happens with my wife?

[00:35:46.990 --> 00:35:51.010]
Positive to pay check and she makes pretty good money. We deposit it and

[00:35:51.630 --> 00:35:59.390]
It got kicked back. Okay, and they never notified us until two weeks later and we ended up right in between 10 and 15 checks

[00:35:59.790 --> 00:36:04.230]
They all got kicked back and they didn't cover them which means they charged us the fee on each check

[00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:10.290]
The problem was they said it was an improper endorsement because we didn't put our account number on it. Oh boy

[00:36:10.290 --> 00:36:15.230]
And uh, but we signed it in other words you endorsed it but you didn't put the account number on it

[00:36:15.230 --> 00:36:19.030]
We don't put the thing that the thing that I thought was wrong was they actually took the check, you know

[00:36:19.030 --> 00:36:24.090]
The tele looked at it. I mean, I think it's somewhat their responsibility to make sure you know proper door right

[00:36:24.690 --> 00:36:28.670]
They put the money they didn't have any holds on it and they put the money directly into our account

[00:36:29.490 --> 00:36:35.090]
So they kicked it back and they put it away. I don't think that the law requires you to put your check number on the back

[00:36:35.090 --> 00:36:37.850]
I think that's just the procedure that some banks require

[00:36:37.850 --> 00:36:42.030]
But but there's no law that I mean you just have to endorse the check you sign it

[00:36:42.030 --> 00:36:45.070]
You don't have to put your account number on the back. Well, that's what they were saying

[00:36:45.070 --> 00:36:48.630]
But the thing that got me was they you know three days later

[00:36:48.630 --> 00:36:50.150]
They're hope to put a hold on our account

[00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:55.910]
But they made no attempt to notify us for two weeks, right? Which means we ended up losing me and it up getting charged by $800

[00:36:56.790 --> 00:37:02.170]
From nations bank because of all the C's plus some companies when you get it, you know when your check bounces

[00:37:02.170 --> 00:37:07.570]
They want to charge you extra to you know of course and uh, so we ended up pulling a lot of money

[00:37:07.570 --> 00:37:10.770]
And I thought like it was lost out of them and really really pissed me off

[00:37:11.830 --> 00:37:17.190]
But I don't know I've had a lot of problems with the nation's bag not like I just went in there as a matter of fact now

[00:37:17.190 --> 00:37:22.050]
The positive to check and I wanted to see if it's check cleared because it was actually to the IRS unfortunately

[00:37:22.050 --> 00:37:26.810]
But um I went in there and they didn't they couldn't even tell me what check number it was they had it cleared

[00:37:26.810 --> 00:37:29.530]
But on the screen it didn't have the check number on it

[00:37:30.870 --> 00:37:35.610]
You know what I'm saying yeah, so I don't know it's just I've had a lot of problems with the bank myself

[00:37:35.610 --> 00:37:39.050]
I thought when you were talking about nation's bank yesterday was it was a trip

[00:37:39.930 --> 00:37:42.090]
So well the story gets even better now

[00:37:42.090 --> 00:37:45.270]
I know but we luck pal. Okay, it was good talking. Good day. Thanks

[00:37:45.690 --> 00:37:48.750]
Yeah, kids even better and then of course from between the bank to my house

[00:37:48.750 --> 00:37:50.270]
Which takes about five or six minutes

[00:37:50.270 --> 00:37:57.550]
It gets even more exciting as I pick up this piece of crap out of the mail and then and this is just one out of maybe 15 or 20 of these episodes over the last few years

[00:37:57.550 --> 00:38:01.710]
And they just never once never never once never

[00:38:03.210 --> 00:38:06.170]
Has Kimberly Lieberman or anybody else picked up the phone

[00:38:06.170 --> 00:38:10.430]
They've got my phone number and called me and said oh gee there's a problem here

[00:38:10.430 --> 00:38:15.250]
We think you've got the uh check that is over drawn and uh, do you want to come over here and the straight it out or

[00:38:15.270 --> 00:38:19.090]
Maybe it's armor steak or your miss or you know, whatever never never once

[00:38:19.790 --> 00:38:21.990]
Because everybody is just a statistic

[00:38:23.530 --> 00:38:28.190]
And all this stuff goes through Tampa through the regional banking center in Tampa

[00:38:28.190 --> 00:38:33.170]
Where people haven't got any idea who you are or what you are or who's on first or what's going on

[00:38:33.170 --> 00:38:36.190]
All they know is that somebody puts something into a computer somewhere

[00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:42.790]
Some moron somebody with a kindergarten education put something into a computer and couldn't get it straightened out

[00:38:42.790 --> 00:38:49.450]
Couldn't get it right somebody with a mentality of a Johnny Dolan put the information to read a computer and your life is hanging into balance

[00:38:50.590 --> 00:38:54.870]
I mean we're talking about we're not talking about uh, you know how many eggs you got in a refrigerator

[00:38:54.870 --> 00:38:56.650]
We're talking about your money folks

[00:38:57.570 --> 00:38:58.710]
That's what we're talking about

[00:38:59.470 --> 00:39:02.630]
And the way they handle it and the way they deal with it's enough to a scared living

[00:39:04.110 --> 00:39:05.810]
Audio worked for me yesterday fine

[00:39:07.050 --> 00:39:12.130]
So that that might be a good addendum to the atkins you know if you're having a little bit trouble moving your balls when you're on the atkins

[00:39:12.130 --> 00:39:17.410]
Because it's a little bit vinding just start banking at Haitians bank. You'll be crap in your brains out

[00:39:18.770 --> 00:39:24.810]
Here's a lady in voka hello. Hello. Yes, ma'am. Yeah, I have a banking story from a couple years ago. Yeah

[00:39:24.810 --> 00:39:29.870]
It was a weekend, you know, and I decided that I wanted to eat so I went to the ATM machine

[00:39:29.870 --> 00:39:32.150]
You got some nerve. Yeah, it's terrible, huh

[00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:37.910]
So the thing came back. I wanted to withdraw from my checking right and it came back in sufficient funds in the receipt

[00:39:37.910 --> 00:39:41.690]
And I said what because I know there's enough money in there. So I did a balanced check

[00:39:41.690 --> 00:39:45.870]
Okay, now listen to this it said that my checking account was over drawn by

[00:39:46.490 --> 00:39:49.550]
$1,760,000 like

[00:39:49.550 --> 00:39:53.770]
43 cents. Hey listen if you got a screw off at least do a big time. That's the way to do it

[00:39:53.770 --> 00:39:56.610]
So then I checked my savings account and that was fine

[00:39:56.610 --> 00:40:00.270]
Okay, yet when I tried to withdraw from it, it wouldn't let me okay

[00:40:00.270 --> 00:40:03.190]
So Monday comes I go to the bank at the time it was

[00:40:03.670 --> 00:40:09.490]
First Union, which I just taken over southeast right so I go there and I explain the situation of them

[00:40:09.490 --> 00:40:12.450]
And I said you know I'd like to take some money out. I'm getting hungry, you know

[00:40:12.450 --> 00:40:14.890]
No, we can't do it your account is frozen

[00:40:15.530 --> 00:40:20.550]
Okay, now to make the long story short it took me two weeks to straighten it out

[00:40:20.550 --> 00:40:23.110]
Okay, in order to get access to my account

[00:40:23.110 --> 00:40:29.590]
I needed a letter of authorization from so and so and such and such up in North Carolina or whatever

[00:40:30.130 --> 00:40:34.310]
They had to present the letter to the teller and have her call him in all this other crap

[00:40:34.850 --> 00:40:36.490]
I couldn't believe it for two weeks

[00:40:36.490 --> 00:40:40.490]
They wouldn't even let me touch my savings account which had the correct balance

[00:40:41.150 --> 00:40:46.690]
So in other words some bozo punched in a whole bunch of extra zeros on something and it took two weeks out of your life

[00:40:46.690 --> 00:40:49.870]
Right, you know, I don't know what the law is on this, but it sounds to me

[00:40:50.250 --> 00:40:53.890]
It sounds to me like somebody ought to be suing the crap out of these banks

[00:40:53.890 --> 00:40:59.250]
Yeah, and did you over here? I think it's um sun bank. I don't want to say the wrong bank blah blah blah

[00:40:59.250 --> 00:41:01.290]
But sun bankers, son trust

[00:41:01.930 --> 00:41:05.530]
No, this is that it happened when it was sun bank. Okay, okay

[00:41:06.170 --> 00:41:10.250]
And there's an article on the paper about how right let's say you have four hundred dollars in your account

[00:41:10.250 --> 00:41:13.870]
You write a check or they say you have four hundred dollars in your account

[00:41:13.870 --> 00:41:18.050]
You write a check for four hundred ten dollars. They and then a check for a hundred dollars. Okay

[00:41:18.910 --> 00:41:22.470]
Now let's say the checks for a hundred dollars comes through the bank first

[00:41:22.470 --> 00:41:27.830]
Right, they are supposed to process that check first because they get the check first, right now

[00:41:27.830 --> 00:41:32.090]
If they want to and this is what I believe sun bank got into trouble for right?

[00:41:32.090 --> 00:41:36.370]
Let's say a check that comes in around is like on the same day, but later

[00:41:36.370 --> 00:41:39.670]
Okay, if that check will cause the other check to bounce

[00:41:39.670 --> 00:41:44.930]
They will process that checks first so that they can incur a bounce check fee on you for two days

[00:41:44.930 --> 00:41:47.910]
Right to get that 27 bucks or whatever it is, right?

[00:41:47.930 --> 00:41:50.770]
If I got that guy who says he never checks his bank statement

[00:41:50.770 --> 00:41:56.390]
Right, he is a psychopath because see a lot of people don't realize that banks are profit making institutions

[00:41:56.390 --> 00:41:58.990]
They're not non-profit service organizations

[00:41:59.510 --> 00:42:03.450]
Forget it. There are bunch of vultures right to the to rip us off whenever they can get away with it

[00:42:03.450 --> 00:42:07.890]
Right, and then a while after this happened I pulled out a first union right and I wanted to open an account

[00:42:07.890 --> 00:42:10.770]
Unfortunately, it hasians bank because they were right on the street

[00:42:10.770 --> 00:42:17.190]
You know, they open a new office. I go up there right and I had at the time something happened right

[00:42:17.190 --> 00:42:19.010]
I had a good thing, you know anyway

[00:42:19.010 --> 00:42:24.210]
I had twenty five thousand dollars to open an account with right yeah, they would not take my money and I said why

[00:42:24.670 --> 00:42:28.910]
Okay, it turned out to be to my benefit because I went somewhere else right yeah

[00:42:28.910 --> 00:42:32.430]
You bet with first union okay somewhere in the process

[00:42:32.430 --> 00:42:37.290]
I ended up owing first union eleven dollars that I had it paid because I didn't even know about it

[00:42:37.290 --> 00:42:40.290]
Yeah, and this eleven dollars thing is all over on my credit

[00:42:40.290 --> 00:42:45.270]
Oh, you've only got twenty when you've only got twenty five grand. Why should they expect you're gonna be able to pay the eleven bucks

[00:42:45.270 --> 00:42:51.050]
That's right. So I just couldn't believe it. It was just so absurd. I felt like I was going not to or I don't know

[00:42:51.610 --> 00:42:57.910]
But anyway, um, that's my way like you said yourself you lucked out yeah in the long run you were away ahead of the game

[00:42:57.910 --> 00:43:02.250]
Right, so don't do it against sweetheart. No, okay, good luck. Bye

[00:43:03.550 --> 00:43:10.730]
The beat goes on baby. It just goes on and on and on and just stupid idiotic pathetic mistakes

[00:43:10.730 --> 00:43:15.130]
Can't we just set up a system like you know what's going on? Oh

[00:43:15.130 --> 00:43:15.870]
We can't do that

[00:43:17.350 --> 00:43:22.310]
Because we don't know what's going on and by the way, you know that the one with the green here and the purple eyes

[00:43:22.310 --> 00:43:23.950]
That just gave she's only here for like two hours

[00:43:23.950 --> 00:43:29.250]
And she'll ever be here again and she doesn't know who you are so be sure and like put your penis imprint on the a check

[00:43:29.250 --> 00:43:31.570]
So she has some idea it's small, you know, she'll know it's you

[00:43:32.750 --> 00:43:38.430]
We have an open line in date seven five one. We got two and brown or five two four and two on the green lines one eight hundred

[00:43:38.430 --> 00:43:43.710]
Oye, Vesmir nobody cares about that game last night, huh? I still say we could have used a little and of course

[00:43:43.710 --> 00:43:48.810]
We still got Gary Stevens there who's still as offensive as ever. That was Jimmy's I think biggest mistake

[00:43:48.810 --> 00:43:52.630]
I have no idea maybe maybe Gary's got the pictures. Maybe that's what it's all about

[00:43:53.130 --> 00:43:54.710]
But boy you talk about

[00:43:56.170 --> 00:44:00.330]
Disaster the running game a working Bernie is getting cream and we just keep doing the same thing

[00:44:00.330 --> 00:44:06.450]
He drops back three or four yards and just gets blasted over and over and over again nice nice finish

[00:44:06.450 --> 00:44:10.830]
And we're still in the game that's the thing that otherwise you to said okay go to bed early forget about it

[00:44:10.830 --> 00:44:13.650]
We just got bombed and he got hurt and he'll be back in a couple of weeks

[00:44:13.650 --> 00:44:18.190]
We got to buy next week will be okay, but we still had a chance to pull that baby out

[00:44:19.570 --> 00:44:23.930]
And I just didn't see too much original too much exciting too much innovative too much

[00:44:23.930 --> 00:44:29.610]
And I still would like to see that Pockmark kid near the fourth quarter put that Craig Erickson in so what if he was the worst

[00:44:29.610 --> 00:44:32.070]
Lay that that brought ever had big deal. We don't care about that

[00:44:34.410 --> 00:44:35.590]
That's not what Bernie said

[00:44:36.970 --> 00:44:38.150]

Atkins diet. Yeah, so I went out and I checked out the book. Yeah, and

Retarded looking blimp. Yeah, and now I'm svelte and got people saying hi to me and treating me like a real

[00:47:53.250 --> 00:48:00.210]
Human being. Yeah, it's unbelievable. That's some my my impact here has been my all the way from from the keys to Minneapolis

[00:48:00.210 --> 00:48:02.850]
I am telling the Atkins great. I tried

[00:48:03.490 --> 00:48:08.150]
The over 11 years. I tried everything that came down the pipe and nothing works. Yeah

[00:48:08.770 --> 00:48:13.610]
And just to to why I walk down the street and I see people that are fat

[00:48:13.610 --> 00:48:19.090]
I'm just like thinking you've been fed a bunch of lies that they could just knew about this diet

[00:48:19.090 --> 00:48:21.410]
They could just you know change their life. Right

[00:48:21.970 --> 00:48:26.370]
It's incredible all these people that are running and buying the fat-free donuts and blowing up like a giant balloon

[00:48:26.370 --> 00:48:34.990]
It's ridiculous. Yeah, so I miss you fantastic man. Keep up the great work. All right. Can I say hello although it's probably prohibited by FCC

[00:48:37.230 --> 00:48:38.310]
Mon bag

[00:48:39.010 --> 00:48:39.490]
Who?

[00:48:39.910 --> 00:48:40.510]
Mon bag

[00:48:40.510 --> 00:48:42.950]

[00:48:54.030 --> 00:48:56.970]
We have an open line of power. How do you like that? They're losing it in Minneapolis

[00:48:56.970 --> 00:48:59.950]
Are they shouting in Minneapolis yet? Are they shouting in Atlanta?

[00:49:01.050 --> 00:49:06.210]
So here's somebody speaking of the Atkins somebody John and Delray Beach sends me a thing

[00:49:07.130 --> 00:49:13.210]
From uh, what is this from FAA not the airline people by the way speaking of the airline people Robert Francis

[00:49:13.210 --> 00:49:14.190]
I think you're a liar

[00:49:15.050 --> 00:49:19.630]
Food addicts anonymous is this FAA and it has a thing about sugar

[00:49:19.630 --> 00:49:23.030]
An incredible addictive thing and uh

[00:49:24.010 --> 00:49:27.770]
This is a guide to abstinence from sugar and all this other bull crap

[00:49:28.270 --> 00:49:33.430]
And it's I'm looking through and it's pretty boring to be honest with you John. It's really a terminal

[00:49:33.930 --> 00:49:38.850]
Oh, I see this is this is an organization where it's like a real thing. I thought it was like a put on

[00:49:38.850 --> 00:49:45.770]
This is a real group. This is like uh, what's that other one that they have the anonymous checkers? Yeah, chubby checkers right

[00:49:47.090 --> 00:49:47.590]
Oh

[00:49:47.590 --> 00:49:51.810]
Give me a break. No, it's for fat birds. It's called chubby peckers for fat chickens

[00:49:52.910 --> 00:49:57.890]
Now seriously what's the uh dieters over over eaters anonymous? That's the other one

[00:49:57.890 --> 00:50:04.910]
But this is food addicts anonymous FAA and it's a group to uh, you know help you get off the uh sugar and all other carbohydrates

[00:50:04.910 --> 00:50:08.310]
You're addicted. I don't care what anybody says. It's not a debatable point. It's a fact

[00:50:08.890 --> 00:50:11.130]
It's a fact man. It's addictive

[00:50:11.950 --> 00:50:19.310]
And if you want to deny it be in denial. Okay, we'll bring your we'll pack your sandwich and bring your flowers 1047 at W I O D

[00:50:19.310 --> 00:50:23.450]
And we say dolphins on radio. We mean simmering mad dog

[00:50:23.450 --> 00:50:28.630]
Just for my adults. I'm right turn down the TV

[00:50:28.630 --> 00:50:34.030]
Then crank up the dolphins on the only radio station you remember when the dolphins play

[00:50:34.590 --> 00:50:36.570]
News talking entertainment radio

[00:50:37.230 --> 00:50:40.410]
610 W I O T

[00:50:40.410 --> 00:50:43.090]
1051 a W I D somebody named Billy

[00:50:43.690 --> 00:50:47.550]
Whose out of states we can't hear me anyway. It's as a former student

[00:50:47.550 --> 00:50:52.210]
Listen to whatever the hell it says for 30 years. He lived in a florida's moved to a new Mexico

[00:50:52.210 --> 00:50:57.390]
And he sends me the Santa Fe, New Mexican from Thursday, September 19th

[00:50:57.390 --> 00:51:01.770]
And the front page story is about this former arch bishop Robert Sanchez

[00:51:02.330 --> 00:51:05.690]
Who says I didn't know abuse was a crime

[00:51:06.350 --> 00:51:11.670]
This is the most unbelievable pile of crap and this also I want to dedicate this story to that

[00:51:11.670 --> 00:51:16.990]
Orthodox or whatever that from you that called me for on Rick and suds that was so upset because I don't respect his

[00:51:17.750 --> 00:51:18.770]
archaic beliefs

[00:51:20.010 --> 00:51:23.110]
revelations included in the 700 page documents say

[00:51:23.690 --> 00:51:30.530]
A former archbishop Sanchez as he thought that in theological terms abuse of children is less grave than abortion or striking a priest

[00:51:31.270 --> 00:51:37.470]
He did not consider a priest who had fathered a child and been treated for alcoholism a threat and allowed him to return to parish work

[00:51:37.470 --> 00:51:42.230]
He was unaware of any extensive and continued damage that a child might suffer from sexual abuse

[00:51:42.990 --> 00:51:49.390]
He never thought of initiating extensive investigations and a sexual abuse by priests because he didn't want to divide congregations

[00:51:49.970 --> 00:51:55.350]
He also said that in one case an investigation of abuse was left to a priest who had also been accused of improprieties

[00:51:57.090 --> 00:52:00.050]
Here's the best here's the best line of all

[00:52:01.170 --> 00:52:08.390]
He said he didn't know until the late 1980s more than a decade after allegations of child abuse by priests first came to his attention

[00:52:08.390 --> 00:52:10.630]
That molesting children is a crime

[00:52:11.350 --> 00:52:18.030]
I certainly had no idea that I had any obligation to bring that type of offense against the person of the authorities who said

[00:52:20.190 --> 00:52:29.790]
He also revealed that he had sexual activity during the 19 years he served as archbishop who resigned to 1993 after three women publicly accused him of having sexual relationships with them

[00:52:31.450 --> 00:52:39.390]
And it goes on and on and on but this is this is the best he had no idea had any obligation to bring it to the authorities or that it was a crime

[00:52:40.410 --> 00:52:46.370]
molesting children of course not papa no problem father old tool God here's a lady in western hello

Oh god, you know how far that is at least 10 minutes

[00:55:09.270 --> 00:55:14.510]
We have an open line on a purple line pound iod mobile one cell AT&T wireless. We have one on a green line wanted

[00:55:14.510 --> 00:55:18.050]
Yeah, I'm I want out. I want out of Haitian's bank

[00:55:18.930 --> 00:55:23.590]
It wasn't bad enough that it was so embarrassing that it was it not not just not just another hold

[00:55:23.590 --> 00:55:26.590]
We've already had all the holds on the account in the past that wasn't bad enough

[00:55:26.590 --> 00:55:29.430]
But now we got like oh guess what it was our mistake

[00:55:29.430 --> 00:55:35.450]
You had more than enough to cover the check somebody just decided to bounce it and now you got other checks in your personal account bouncing

[00:55:37.130 --> 00:55:40.970]
And they didn't understand why panic in my apprehension as to well, you know

[00:55:40.970 --> 00:55:45.130]
You've screwed me with $8,000 in my personal account and you're putting it back in there now

[00:55:45.130 --> 00:55:48.750]
But what about the checks that may have coming against the earlier? Oh well

[00:55:48.750 --> 00:55:52.650]
There's nothing on there right now and I get home and guess what sure they're how sure as I was

[00:55:52.650 --> 00:55:54.770]
They just didn't bother to look that far

[00:55:56.050 --> 00:55:56.750]
Slip shot

[00:55:57.410 --> 00:56:01.270]
Slip shot unacceptable screwing around with other people's money

[00:56:02.930 --> 00:56:04.150]
Here's South Miami. Hello

[00:56:04.870 --> 00:56:06.410]
Hey, Neil how you doing okay?

[00:56:07.110 --> 00:56:10.610]
Another bank story for you here. All right. This is about trying to change banks

[00:56:10.610 --> 00:56:12.390]
It just seems like you could never win

[00:56:12.870 --> 00:56:16.930]
Like I have an account that I have a couple of small business accounts at Barnett Bank

[00:56:16.930 --> 00:56:20.530]
And like I always kept a minimum balance in there. So I wouldn't have to pay a

[00:56:21.110 --> 00:56:27.430]
service fee right and then all of a sudden, you know, I'm checking my bank statements and I see they're hitting me up for

[00:56:27.430 --> 00:56:31.750]
$18 on each account. So that's like 36 bucks a month and I'm throwing away

[00:56:32.570 --> 00:56:35.070]
All of a sudden and then I call them and they say well, you know

[00:56:35.070 --> 00:56:43.190]
We raised our minimum balance by $1,500 on each account. So I was shopping around for another bank to go to

[00:56:44.050 --> 00:56:44.450]
and

[00:56:45.090 --> 00:56:49.790]
So I you know by phone I found out you know, which ones have a minimum balance that I can afford

[00:56:50.630 --> 00:56:54.210]
Charge down everything. This one sounded great. You know, so I go to them

[00:56:56.210 --> 00:57:01.590]
You know it takes like an hour and a half or something sitting there and then you know going through all the paperwork and everything

[00:57:01.970 --> 00:57:07.870]
And then they put my deposits in and it's like great. This is gonna be great. I'm really glad. I'm doing this

[00:57:07.870 --> 00:57:13.810]
And then you know after I've gone through all this paperwork and have my money in their bank. Mm-hmm. She says

[00:57:14.450 --> 00:57:18.070]
By the way, you know, we have a 30-day hold on 30 days

[00:57:19.170 --> 00:57:25.410]
All my money they wouldn't let me tell you it doesn't matter what I put in what bank was it? What bank was that? That's called

[00:57:26.950 --> 00:57:29.870]
Bank United. It's like a South Miami bank

[00:57:31.430 --> 00:57:33.730]
Bank United. Yeah, what the hell is that?

[00:57:34.590 --> 00:57:38.490]
It's a bank that I don't have my money in and it's all they had to give me everything back

[00:57:38.490 --> 00:57:42.310]
You know and my my checks were cancelled on the back and they got all their bank

[00:57:42.310 --> 00:57:46.570]
What what could possibly be the reason for holding anything for 30 days?

[00:57:47.090 --> 00:57:54.310]
That's not even legal I don't think they say they like to establish a relationship with their new customer by pissing them off before they get started

[00:57:54.310 --> 00:57:58.610]
I couldn't believe it. Did they give me did they also hand you a jar of vacillation when they told you this?

[00:57:58.850 --> 00:58:05.930]
I just said give me my money back. Just give it back to me and then I go back to Barnett and like

[00:58:06.370 --> 00:58:11.110]
You know, I'm trying to put these these checks with all the stamps on the back of them back in say look

[00:58:11.110 --> 00:58:16.130]
This is what happened and you can call the other bank if you want to but I need to get this money in the bank

[00:58:16.130 --> 00:58:17.590]
Right and so like

[00:58:18.270 --> 00:58:23.890]
She says well, what were you doing? I say well, you know, I was closing out my accounts here because of your service charges

[00:58:23.890 --> 00:58:28.730]
You know they just too high and so like she says well wait just one minute. Yeah, this is a teller

[00:58:28.730 --> 00:58:31.430]
So she takes the time to go in to see the branch manager

[00:58:32.030 --> 00:58:34.630]
And then they call me in and say well, why do you want to close your accounts?

[00:58:34.750 --> 00:58:36.750]
And so you know, I tell them about the service charges and then

[00:58:37.470 --> 00:58:40.350]
She says well, this is something we don't tell most of our customers

[00:58:40.350 --> 00:58:44.110]
But we have this other account where the fees have you know

[00:58:44.110 --> 00:58:48.050]
Well, it's like to think with the credit cards or you can get a lower rate somewhere else well

[00:58:48.050 --> 00:58:51.730]
We'll charge you all right. We can't do it to the same deal right. We don't tell anybody about it

[00:58:51.730 --> 00:58:56.730]
But we got the same deal here you go. I can't go to a teller though. I have to do everything you know they gave me the

[00:58:58.510 --> 00:59:04.750]
cards to use the machine yeah, and I have to do all my deposits that way if I ever have to go to a teller

[00:59:04.750 --> 00:59:07.430]
Oh, it's like 395 per transaction

[00:59:08.870 --> 00:59:13.550]
You mean like to make a deposit? Yeah, you can't do it. You got to put it in you got to put it in the machine

[00:59:13.550 --> 00:59:18.570]
Well, what do you mean 395 per transaction? In other words, you're putting your money in and they're going to charge you to do that? Yeah

[00:59:19.050 --> 00:59:26.710]
If you go to a teller. Oh my god, that's the only way. Oh my god in heaven. I'm going to the wheeling wall right now

[00:59:26.710 --> 00:59:32.890]
If you find a bank, please let everybody know okay, yeah, I'm in South Miami. I don't know where I'm going to work on family bank

[00:59:33.530 --> 00:59:38.570]

[01:01:00.250 --> 01:01:00.470]

We lie in the sun till we get melanoma we bake like a bun you can spell the aroma we got love stars skin bigger than the metroidoma

[01:01:09.530 --> 01:01:09.970]

We don't care if we get melanoma we got the best tan from here to Arizona

[01:01:16.390 --> 01:01:19.110]
We don't have genital condoloma

[01:01:19.110 --> 01:01:19.650]
Hey

[01:01:22.430 --> 01:01:28.570]
1106 at W I O D and so anyway father O tool here is asked did you know that what Jason's siglar

[01:01:28.570 --> 01:01:32.750]
This is one of the a child molesting priest that what he did to the children of your first years was a crime

[01:01:32.750 --> 01:01:35.070]
He says I did not know it was a crime sir

[01:01:36.330 --> 01:01:43.490]
Question so you did not feel in your own heart of hearts in 1981 that sexual molestation of a child was a crime answer from father O tool

[01:01:43.490 --> 01:01:47.130]
Sir in 1981 I did not understand that to be a crime I

[01:01:47.850 --> 01:01:53.670]
Considered to consider it to be a moral infraction of his own life and it was an offense against the child, but not a crime

[01:01:55.110 --> 01:01:55.510]
Oh

[01:01:55.510 --> 01:02:00.550]
God talk about where and of course, you know this is the place remember the thing that 60 minutes did a few years ago

[01:02:00.550 --> 01:02:05.750]
Three four years ago. This is the place in New Mexico where they send all these other priests

[01:02:06.190 --> 01:02:11.490]
Who have been the diddlin with kids they send them there to like be rehabilitated instead of saying the prison where they belong

[01:02:12.330 --> 01:02:17.270]
Or sending them to some place to really get treatment for whatever their damn problem is they sent them to this place

[01:02:17.270 --> 01:02:22.070]
So they can molest the kids in the new Mexico. Maybe the Indians do and the Mexicans

[01:02:23.830 --> 01:02:25.570]
Here's Miami. Hello. Yes

[01:02:26.310 --> 01:02:27.410]
Hello, yes sir

[01:02:28.790 --> 01:02:34.330]
Uh, I'm calling in reference to you'd tirade on the banks. Yes, and I have

[01:02:35.330 --> 01:02:45.370]
My hatred for the banks goes back to February 1st 1965 hatred my hatred for the bank. Yeah, I was a newspaper reporter sent in by the

[01:02:46.230 --> 01:02:52.130]
Sports Editor to interview a guy by the name of Max Schmaling who on June 9th 1936

[01:02:52.690 --> 01:02:53.710]
Beath the liven daylight

[01:02:53.710 --> 01:03:00.150]
Joe Lewis right and I got I went through the story and so forth and towards the end of the interview

[01:03:00.150 --> 01:03:03.950]
He says to me. He says I'm German. He says we fired the bullets

[01:03:04.610 --> 01:03:09.190]
And he says you Americans pay to put him in the chamber and I says what he's talking about

[01:03:09.750 --> 01:03:13.030]
He says I sit with Hitler for two years

[01:03:13.030 --> 01:03:20.230]
He says Hitler would never get up from the table without laughing with those people in presence in saying if it wasn't for the federal

[01:03:20.230 --> 01:03:25.950]
Reserve system which is our banking system given me 43 million dollars. I would have never made it to power

[01:03:26.450 --> 01:03:32.950]
Now I did some research on this and I found that the federal reserve was established in the December of 1913

[01:03:33.450 --> 01:03:40.410]
And on January of 1933 Hitler had his rare intake by a guy by the name of on Hintikberg

[01:03:41.970 --> 01:03:46.390]
Yeah, yeah, remember he had a weird thing out of whether you're hearing me or not. Not hearing okay

[01:03:47.190 --> 01:03:52.170]
And Hintik there were 33 million vote caps. Yep, they're getting on these 12 billion

[01:03:53.070 --> 01:03:54.610]
And the reason

[01:03:54.610 --> 01:03:58.770]
Resolves is that Hitler politely chewed without a collector

[01:03:59.670 --> 01:04:01.510]
Now as the result of this

[01:04:02.230 --> 01:04:07.610]
The bankers here in America were saying well that's the fault of this stock market in

[01:04:07.610 --> 01:04:09.590]
December 29th

[01:04:10.510 --> 01:04:12.850]
We've been more years than the dolphins of a different

[01:04:16.570 --> 01:04:17.530]
Are you

[01:04:24.490 --> 01:04:27.350]
I think he's done are you sure positive

[01:04:28.070 --> 01:04:32.850]
So anyway, we have an open line in the green line 1 800 9 4 4 9 4 6 3

[01:04:32.850 --> 01:04:37.350]
Let's hear about the trilateral commission in the new world order. Okay, and about six pack shicker

[01:04:38.810 --> 01:04:43.430]
Here's the Tamarack hello. Hey don't know. Yes, sir. What about the game yesterday? Okay?

[01:04:43.850 --> 01:04:47.690]
Other front pages sports says no Reno no win no victory

[01:04:47.690 --> 01:04:53.250]
Yeah, I don't believe even with Dan with it. They would have won that game. How come how come Jim Kelly was out of the game for Buffalo

[01:04:53.250 --> 01:04:55.210]
And they beat the Cowboys on Sunday exactly

[01:04:55.210 --> 01:04:59.310]
I mean, you know Danny's great and all of that and he looked like he was really on there early in the game

[01:04:59.310 --> 01:05:02.310]
Although he was limping almost from the start, but he looked like his arm was really on

[01:05:02.310 --> 01:05:04.030]
And I thought we were gonna be in for a night

[01:05:04.030 --> 01:05:09.590]
But you notice something on that first drive again same old crap we get first in goal inside the five yard line field goal

[01:05:09.590 --> 01:05:13.590]
Same old crap again. That's it and you know something they got beat all up and down

[01:05:13.590 --> 01:05:16.890]
They're offensive line got beat 50 that's why they went into the game number one

[01:05:16.890 --> 01:05:21.170]
Rush defense. Yeah, but look who we played like I tried to tell people look who we've been playing

[01:05:21.170 --> 01:05:25.230]
This was this wasn't the jets exactly and he had seven starters out

[01:05:25.230 --> 01:05:31.330]
But can you figure why in that fourth quarter? I have to you just knew that they were gonna be blitzing Bernie on every third down

[01:05:32.270 --> 01:05:38.630]
And then we're in the last few minutes on every down why didn't we run it one draw play we never tried it once and

[01:05:38.630 --> 01:05:43.610]
They were stuffing it down our throat every time they ran the draw eight yards ten yards twelve yards

[01:05:43.610 --> 01:05:47.310]
And we never expected it. I mean they could do it anytime they wanted

[01:05:47.310 --> 01:05:52.370]
That's how they done and even even even with all the injuries on their defensive line

[01:05:52.370 --> 01:05:54.370]
We still couldn't run the ball. That's the thing that's scary

[01:05:55.070 --> 01:05:55.730]
That's it's it

[01:05:55.730 --> 01:05:59.470]
All right, Neil good talk to you. Okay pal have a good day and back to you

[01:05:59.470 --> 01:06:02.130]
Yeah, so we got to buy next week then Danny. I'll be back

[01:06:02.130 --> 01:06:07.710]
He's got a twisted ankle no need to have a panic all I tell you look pretty scary there when they had a shoe and one other thing

[01:06:07.710 --> 01:06:12.990]
I don't understand I don't want to start second guessing Jimmy, but he ain't perfect either okay, especially with their hairdo

[01:06:14.710 --> 01:06:18.650]
You remember when they took marino out and at that time we're thinking oh not that a kill

[01:06:18.650 --> 01:06:22.950]
He's ten to get oh jeez and and these got his shoe off okay, and he's over on the bench and they're like

[01:06:23.310 --> 01:06:27.310]
Massage in his foot. They bring in the masseuse and she's rubbing it and his foot too and

[01:06:27.310 --> 01:06:30.490]
And now they show Bernie now granted the cul-seg at the ball

[01:06:30.490 --> 01:06:37.230]
But Bernie is standing on a sideline talking joking with Craig Eriksson and with a couple other guys. He's got his is cap on

[01:06:38.330 --> 01:06:40.750]
He's not warming up his arm. He's not like getting ready

[01:06:40.750 --> 01:06:46.070]
He's not putting the helmet eyes not getting ready to go in it. He's just dittling around and and the deodor for my can't stand

[01:06:46.070 --> 01:06:49.730]
But for once in his life. He said there he said you know if if there's a turnover now

[01:06:49.730 --> 01:06:52.610]
The dolphins get the ball in the next few seconds. They got no quarterback

[01:06:53.850 --> 01:06:58.810]
They got nobody ready to go in there and then play quarterback because marino sure is how can't get back in there now no matter

[01:06:58.810 --> 01:07:01.910]
Even if he's okay. He's got what's he gonna do when there was one shoe

[01:07:04.110 --> 01:07:08.570]
So I don't know what they're thinking about over there, but maybe that's maybe there've been at the bank too much

[01:07:08.570 --> 01:07:11.010]
Maybe Jimmy's been to the bank too much. Oh, that could be it

[01:07:12.090 --> 01:07:18.230]
It's 12 minutes after 11 at WIOD some nights. I go for a walk in the clouds others. I have nightmares about reading this copy

[01:07:18.230 --> 01:07:20.330]
Other nights. I just die hard with the vengeance

[01:07:20.330 --> 01:07:26.410]
I like to get bushwack with the brothers McMullen ever see them check out the little shopper horrors with the swan princess

[01:07:26.410 --> 01:07:32.650]
Out of the Hula Moan or invite Mrs. Parker with a vicious circle over with the Hoosiers to have a bonfire of the vanities in the living room

[01:07:32.650 --> 01:07:36.810]
Hey, I'm nobody's fool, but I can't wait to rock around a clock after I scream and scream again

[01:07:36.810 --> 01:07:41.330]
What am I talking about? I'm talking about this copy. I'm talking about cinematics. It's really unbelievable

[01:07:41.330 --> 01:07:48.150]
It's great nothing but movies if you're a fright fan check out hell razor three hell on earth from beyond the grave in Frankenstein

[01:07:48.230 --> 01:07:54.090]
Must be destroyed like the action flicks to an infer last man standing expect numeracy in the specialist need a love lesson

[01:07:54.090 --> 01:07:58.310]
Try love has many pushes of faces love is a gun and love with a proper stranger

[01:07:58.310 --> 01:08:02.110]
If you've got movies on your mind, this is the place for you just one that work you need

[01:08:02.110 --> 01:08:06.110]
Cinematics with over 250 movies showing just this month during September

[01:08:06.110 --> 01:08:10.870]
Cinematics if you're really are into movies and if you're in a good copy man forget about WIOD

[01:08:35.290 --> 01:08:36.170]
Oh

[01:08:36.170 --> 01:08:39.450]
Feel Henry to the 60M on news talking entertainment radio

[01:08:39.450 --> 01:08:41.530]
610 WIOD

[01:08:43.350 --> 01:08:44.670]
I just can't wait until

[01:08:57.270 --> 01:08:57.910]
You

[01:08:57.910 --> 01:09:01.770]
Gonna watch it's well

[01:09:05.790 --> 01:09:08.470]
I've got no interest in politics

[01:09:09.430 --> 01:09:11.670]
Well, Robert Doltz just kind of makes me sick

[01:09:12.590 --> 01:09:14.870]
Who bad there isn't someone else to pick

[01:09:15.950 --> 01:09:18.350]
Because he reminds me of tricky dick

[01:09:19.150 --> 01:09:22.330]
That's why I'm betting at my books don't lose

[01:09:23.630 --> 01:09:29.110]
When no mission chooses a lot of people say he's ruthless

[01:09:30.110 --> 01:09:32.650]
His campaign rhetoric proves it

[01:09:33.470 --> 01:09:35.710]
Gonna watch his Robert Doltz's

[01:09:36.590 --> 01:09:38.630]
Your mind is well vote for me

[01:09:39.870 --> 01:09:41.890]
Your mind is well vote for me

[01:09:41.890 --> 01:09:44.230]
I know that Clinton isn't as tall

[01:09:44.990 --> 01:09:47.330]
And for that matter so is once a pro

[01:09:48.050 --> 01:09:51.050]
But I just cannot bet for Robert Doltz

[01:09:51.830 --> 01:09:54.030]
Everybody says he's too old

[01:09:54.830 --> 01:09:56.250]
That's why I'm telling you

[01:09:56.250 --> 01:10:01.530]
When no mission chooses

[01:10:01.530 --> 01:10:02.530]
Are we on the air?

[01:10:15.370 --> 01:10:17.890]
Your mind is well vote for me

[01:10:18.690 --> 01:10:20.810]
Fans beginning to blow the blow the

[01:10:21.690 --> 01:10:24.850]
Who the place election eleven seventeen at WIOD

[01:10:24.850 --> 01:10:28.570]
I can easily understand that especially with Bernie in there doing his side saddle routine

[01:10:28.570 --> 01:10:31.490]
But that's an ugly thing to watch. I'll tell you man. Oh man when he starts

[01:10:31.490 --> 01:10:36.190]
You know flapping his arms like a duck. That's a really ugly thing to have to watch

[01:10:36.730 --> 01:10:38.030]
Here's a poppin. Oh hello

[01:10:38.990 --> 01:10:42.310]
Yeah, I think that's why he wasn't so anxious to get into the game. Yeah

[01:10:42.310 --> 01:10:46.190]
He knows that he's too slow for the NFL man. Yes he is

[01:10:46.750 --> 01:10:49.950]
He wasn't a winner in Cleveland. He's he's he's never one in the big city

[01:10:49.950 --> 01:10:51.930]
As immobile as a statue

[01:10:51.930 --> 01:10:54.450]
Yeah, you see him get in the game. It's like oh boy

[01:10:54.450 --> 01:10:56.690]
Well wouldn't you wouldn't I mean I'm not a big Craig Urson

[01:10:56.690 --> 01:11:01.070]
Listen to me. Yeah, I'm not a big Craig Urson fan to say the best okay

[01:11:01.070 --> 01:11:03.990]
But at least he's young and he's mobile okay

[01:11:03.990 --> 01:11:06.690]
Wouldn't wouldn't you have thought there maybe in the last couple of series

[01:11:06.690 --> 01:11:09.930]
They might have tried sticking him in there since they knew that the cults were you know

[01:11:09.930 --> 01:11:14.450]
Blitz and like crazy and they were like you know and Bernie had no chance of getting away from the blitz

[01:11:14.450 --> 01:11:18.710]
They might have put somebody in who might have been able to get out of the pocket and scramble a little bit and make a play

[01:11:18.710 --> 01:11:22.150]
Right, we couldn't make one short reception in any of that and then of course

[01:11:22.150 --> 01:11:27.970]
Then of course Karim drops the screen pass. He finally gets he finally gets away from their past rush

[01:11:27.970 --> 01:11:32.210]
He finally makes a nice little screen pass and oops. There it is. That was the first downplay

[01:11:32.210 --> 01:11:36.350]
That would have kept the drive going who knows what would happen? Well, he was probably surprised that Bernie got it off

[01:11:36.350 --> 01:11:39.530]
Yeah, that's true, but uh, you know, he's too slow. He's got to go

[01:11:39.930 --> 01:11:43.350]
Right man, he just uh, you know, look and it also looked like she was

[01:11:43.350 --> 01:11:48.470]
He was back or something. I was trying to mix it up a little of on offense if nothing is working

[01:11:48.470 --> 01:11:52.550]
Don't destroy your hands up and uh, but we couldn't run the ball, you know at all

[01:11:52.550 --> 01:11:56.050]
I mean not not a lick not an inch not a not at all nothing

[01:11:56.710 --> 01:11:59.270]
Now they're running it up the middle honest again like last year right

[01:11:59.270 --> 01:12:01.950]
Right up the middle every every time they wanted to him

[01:12:01.950 --> 01:12:07.690]
And you got the feeling that any time they want to run the draw play it was gonna be like a shock towards like we didn't know what was coming right

[01:12:08.330 --> 01:12:10.830]
for anyways uh next week we won't lose guarantee

[01:12:10.830 --> 01:12:13.550]
I'm trying to and that's what I can say okay later thanks pal

[01:12:13.550 --> 01:12:17.210]
Yeah, next week I guarantee no dolphin loss. Yeah, I'm gonna bet my life on it

[01:12:18.150 --> 01:12:22.630]
We have an open line in Broward 524 and I also guarantee you that Bernie won't be starting next Sunday

[01:12:22.630 --> 01:12:25.310]
Of course, we're not playing next Sunday or Monday or oh thank god

[01:12:25.310 --> 01:12:29.010]
We got that week off to regroup and reorganize and get Danny healed up and uh

[01:12:29.010 --> 01:12:33.430]
Get a new second string quarterback. Sorry Bernie or a great guy. We love Bernie's a really good guy

[01:12:33.430 --> 01:12:36.870]
Never stole a freight train everybody loves him, but the send him back to Cleveland

[01:12:36.870 --> 01:12:39.770]
He could fit in good with their team right now. Oh, they don't have one

[01:12:40.630 --> 01:12:42.970]
Here's uh here's polka hello

[01:12:43.690 --> 01:12:49.010]
Hello, yes, sir. Hi. How you doing? Okay. I wanted to tell you a bank story of all bank stories

[01:12:49.010 --> 01:12:53.290]
You think eight thousand dollars is a lot. How'd you like to lose five hundred and forty nice

[01:12:54.930 --> 01:13:01.290]
Thousand thousand nice get it back though. Can't tell you the bank not allowed to terms of the lawsuit settlement

[01:13:01.290 --> 01:13:03.830]
Oh lawsuit the law I like the sounds of that

[01:13:04.530 --> 01:13:09.270]
Make a deposit the teller punches in two digits incorrect

[01:13:09.270 --> 01:13:14.670]
In other words the right numbers on the back of a cashier's check, but she punches in the wrong digits

[01:13:14.670 --> 01:13:18.690]
He may have the account number on the account number nice have a deposit ticket

[01:13:19.190 --> 01:13:21.150]
The bank says the money is missing

[01:13:22.310 --> 01:13:30.570]
60 days. They're still looking for the money. Uh-huh always make a copy of your cashier's checks or your checks that you deposit from other people

[01:13:32.290 --> 01:13:37.810]
Took over a year. Oh beautiful over a year and you sued the rest it cost me

[01:13:37.810 --> 01:13:42.110]
I had to pay over a hundred thousand dollars in attorneys fees. I sued their ass

[01:13:42.890 --> 01:13:44.710]
I got back very well

[01:13:44.710 --> 01:13:48.170]
But took a year out of my life

[01:13:48.750 --> 01:13:50.070]
Mm-hmm, okay

[01:13:50.810 --> 01:13:55.930]
And it wasn't crazy in stupid and it wasn't no care no bother and it wasn't Haitian's bank. Okay

[01:13:56.490 --> 01:13:58.870]
I'm not allowed to say which one from California that

[01:14:01.710 --> 01:14:06.490]
Okay, but they away from them. Okay. I'm gonna do it have a good doubt

[01:14:06.490 --> 01:14:10.230]
We're going to Las Vegas now that we got the money. Great. I hope you I hope you win millions

[01:14:10.230 --> 01:14:15.730]
We're moving there. Oh, you're going you're moving there moving there. I've headed here. I've been here 20 years

[01:14:15.730 --> 01:14:20.510]
Yeah, I've headed we are leaving Friday morning. Well save some space in the trunk

[01:14:21.470 --> 01:14:27.210]
You're welcome to come. Okay. Good luck. Good day. Yeah, best of luck. How do you like that? He hit the jackpot. All right

[01:14:28.310 --> 01:14:36.310]
So just a five hundred and forty thousand dollar mistake you think you got problems because we're dealing with really stupid stupid underpaid people

[01:14:36.310 --> 01:14:40.170]
I'm not saying they're bad people some of the people are very nice some of the people mean well

[01:14:40.170 --> 01:14:44.170]
But you know something what do they say about the best of intentions? Especially when they're dealing with your money

[01:14:44.570 --> 01:14:50.510]
I don't care about good intentions. I'd like to see at least an accurate job. Don't even smile at me. Okay. I don't care about that

[01:14:50.510 --> 01:14:55.050]
It would be nice, but don't even worry about smiling just get get it right get the numbers right

[01:14:55.550 --> 01:14:57.630]
Just get it right that's all that's all I X

[01:14:58.510 --> 01:14:59.650]
Oh, we can't do that

[01:14:59.650 --> 01:15:05.890]
I mean you sit there and you look at that thing and like I said I want you to stop and try to absorb this in your mind

[01:15:05.890 --> 01:15:11.670]
You're looking at 15 or 16 lines on a computer from a ledger from one account

[01:15:12.970 --> 01:15:16.110]
And there are four mistakes out of the 16 lines

[01:15:17.690 --> 01:15:19.750]
And all of them by the way in the bank's favor

[01:15:20.950 --> 01:15:22.050]
all of them to my

[01:15:23.550 --> 01:15:24.690]
Disturbance and discredit

[01:15:27.650 --> 01:15:31.890]
So like I said family bank sounds are pretty interesting. Have they spelled that with a B or not

[01:15:31.890 --> 01:15:36.330]
It's 10 what is it 11 20 oh, that's right. We're gonna have to start giving West Coast time now

[01:15:36.330 --> 01:15:39.990]
If we also have any spy reports about what Steve Nichols said on the year Sunday morning

[01:15:39.990 --> 01:15:43.330]
Since that's the only way we get to find out what he's thinking and what's going on

[01:15:44.350 --> 01:15:48.770]
Since he's pretty much invisible the rest of the week. I mean that just boggles my mind

[01:15:48.770 --> 01:15:52.850]
What that guy called in on Rick and suds this morning about today is the day

[01:15:52.850 --> 01:15:59.350]
He's gonna decide whether he's going with Paxon and Phil we're gonna be simul casting like right off the bat before he even starts and

[01:15:59.350 --> 01:16:05.150]
All this other oh man delusions of fantasy visions of sugar plums

[01:16:06.630 --> 01:16:11.510]
Did I say it's 11 22 at W. I. O. D. You can't say it often enough to screw up those best of tapes

[01:16:12.070 --> 01:16:20.050]
Then W. I. O. D. Your bandage takes us smarter to after each day. I like it. I like it

[01:16:20.870 --> 01:16:28.390]
Are you gay? Are you unsure of your sexuality? Yes being gay is a full-time commitment

[01:16:28.390 --> 01:16:35.270]
So before you sashay on out of the closet pick up a copy of it's okay to be a homo

[01:16:35.910 --> 01:16:40.310]
It's okay to be a homo is a surefire way to find out if you're gay

[01:16:40.950 --> 01:16:50.110]
The book contains page after page of probing questions like how would you say the phrase seven sailors suck slippery shafts

[01:16:50.110 --> 01:16:52.870]
Seven sailors suck slippery shaft or

[01:16:52.870 --> 01:16:59.710]
Questions like would you rather spank a bear bottom or spank your monkey? Oh, that's nice

[01:16:59.710 --> 01:17:05.150]
What kind of question is that? I mean if you really must know I'm not really into cruelty to animals

[01:17:05.150 --> 01:17:10.050]
Well with the exception of jirbel's I'd rather spank a bear bottom bitch. No

[01:17:10.310 --> 01:17:13.170]
Sorry, but bitch isn't until chapter eight

[01:17:13.170 --> 01:17:16.970]
Pick up a copy of it's okay to be a homo

[01:17:16.970 --> 01:17:19.770]
It's okay to be a homo available at all boys tend to rig the bill bookstores

[01:17:19.770 --> 01:17:24.470]
We're not talking about women 1127 at w. I. O. D. We have an open line on a green line

[01:17:24.470 --> 01:17:30.490]
Which I'm not really sure if the green line is gonna disappear after Friday or what the or who's gonna disappear to be honest with you?

[01:17:31.250 --> 01:17:36.730]
I was just talking one of one of our counter-executives who's hobbling around because his colon was stuck deep inside his

[01:17:36.730 --> 01:17:38.850]
Something like that. I thought that's where it's supposed to be

[01:17:38.850 --> 01:17:44.810]
But anyway, did you hear his story about he had like his uh gallbladder out a few years ago?

[01:17:44.810 --> 01:17:50.210]
How could you tell and his colon was like stuck part of it in his uh, I don't know somewhere

[01:17:50.210 --> 01:17:54.950]
I mean when you're doing you're that big it's hard to find where all the parts are anyway

[01:17:54.950 --> 01:17:59.330]
So anyway, we're just commiserating over the fact that nobody knows anything at this point

[01:17:59.330 --> 01:18:01.490]
But hey come Monday boy come Monday

[01:18:02.210 --> 01:18:06.930]
Here's pompano. Hello. Neil. Yes, sir. How you doing? I don't have a bank story for you because I have no money

[01:18:06.930 --> 01:18:09.250]
But uh on a note on last night's game

[01:18:09.250 --> 01:18:11.950]
The reason I didn't put her accident he was on an inactive list

[01:18:11.950 --> 01:18:14.490]
They they couldn't put him in if they wanted yes, they could

[01:18:14.490 --> 01:18:16.610]
Noted from the inactive list. Yes

[01:18:16.610 --> 01:18:21.050]
Oh, thanks. Yes, they could they that's that's the thing we were talking about this morning

[01:18:21.050 --> 01:18:25.610]
He was dressed and when you have one or more of the other first two string quarterbacks

[01:18:25.610 --> 01:18:30.650]
They could have put them in the fourth quarter if they did put him in he would have had to stay in but they could have put him in

[01:18:31.570 --> 01:18:36.050]
Oh, see I didn't realize that right then it's it's some crazy rule that they changed three four years ago

[01:18:36.050 --> 01:18:40.810]
Which I wasn't aware of till last night and especially this part about if they if they put him in

[01:18:41.590 --> 01:18:44.670]
Let's like say in the second quarter. Let's say both Khozar and Merino both got hurt

[01:18:44.670 --> 01:18:48.150]
Okay, okay, and they put him in in the second quarter and then you know

[01:18:48.150 --> 01:18:51.610]
One of the first two guys like shook off the injury was able to come back

[01:18:51.610 --> 01:18:53.710]
It can't put him back until the fourth quarter

[01:18:54.390 --> 01:18:59.930]
Now I know that sounds bizarre, but I think I see the reasoning behind it business if at least they're gonna let you dress

[01:19:00.450 --> 01:19:02.670]
The third string quarterback even though he's inactive

[01:19:02.670 --> 01:19:08.730]
It's it's done to discourage people from you know just willy nilly using three quarterbacks. See what I'm saying

[01:19:08.730 --> 01:19:12.050]
Well, how does fifth third get away with it then with Cornell Stewart

[01:19:12.670 --> 01:19:13.530]
Cornell Stewart

[01:19:14.190 --> 01:19:17.490]
Yeah, but he's but he's not on a roster as a quarterback. Oh, okay

[01:19:17.490 --> 01:19:19.690]
In other words, we could put uh

[01:19:20.270 --> 01:19:25.170]
I don't know somebody else in there as quarterback who's not really on or roster as a quarterback

[01:19:25.650 --> 01:19:28.330]
You follow what I'm saying right now I understand but in other words

[01:19:28.850 --> 01:19:36.290]
Erickson is obviously listed as a quarterback and is dressed but on the inactive list for the game and can only come in in case of injuries to the other two

[01:19:36.290 --> 01:19:43.850]
Oh, that means the problem still red with Garrett Stevens. Don't you think so absolutely. I mean I saw shades of a schula in their last night

[01:19:43.850 --> 01:19:46.090]
I mean granted. I don't want to take anything away from the courts

[01:19:46.090 --> 01:19:48.610]
But they're you know the two defensive ends both out

[01:19:49.010 --> 01:19:54.090]
They had two linebackers banged up. I mean and all of an and we can't do anything against them

[01:19:54.090 --> 01:19:55.610]
No imagination nothing different

[01:19:55.610 --> 01:19:57.670]
Straight up the middle over and over again

[01:19:57.670 --> 01:20:04.070]
And then of course Bernie getting buried over and over and at the fourth quarter was the one of the ugliest things ever seen in my life

[01:20:04.070 --> 01:20:07.030]
You're getting me both right he had

[01:20:07.730 --> 01:20:11.910]
Lest he had less than no chance. I felt so sorry for burning. Yeah, I really did

[01:20:11.910 --> 01:20:13.770]
I mean he not that he's that much of a talent

[01:20:13.770 --> 01:20:17.050]
But he's a good guy goes out there and gives you his best which isn't much

[01:20:17.050 --> 01:20:19.450]
But he gives you his best and he just was getting buried

[01:20:19.450 --> 01:20:21.810]
I mean they didn't give him two seconds of protection

[01:20:21.810 --> 01:20:24.830]
This is true. All right Neil take care. Good luck to us pal.

[01:20:24.830 --> 01:20:26.070]
Hardy boy. We'll be okay

[01:20:26.650 --> 01:20:31.210]
It just wasn't gonna be a 16 and oh here we knew that although some of these people super

[01:20:31.210 --> 01:20:34.130]
ball we beat three horse crap teams and right away to scream and super bowl

[01:20:34.130 --> 01:20:37.890]
I tried to tell you we're gonna lose a few here in there. Uh we'll just hope for the best

[01:20:39.130 --> 01:20:42.670]
Nice catch by OJ there by the way. OJ made a great catch and McDuffie too

[01:20:42.670 --> 01:20:48.150]
Open line and Broward 5249463524 w i o d here's Miami. Hello

[01:20:49.230 --> 01:20:51.670]
Miami Buenos dias. Hi Neil. Yes sir

[01:20:51.810 --> 01:20:54.790]
I'm another bank story for for you. Yes

[01:20:54.790 --> 01:21:01.370]
If I give you a check for arguments sake for $20 drawn on my bank city bank

[01:21:01.890 --> 01:21:04.550]
You decide to go and cash it over the counter

[01:21:05.170 --> 01:21:10.290]
They'll only give you $15 the charges five dollars if you cash to check over a counter

[01:21:12.070 --> 01:21:16.250]
How about if the check is for six bucks? Where you get it back back

[01:21:16.850 --> 01:21:17.690]
You get a dollar

[01:21:18.630 --> 01:21:20.550]
I've just called them now to confirm

[01:21:21.350 --> 01:21:25.850]
Provided well probably the other five bucks goes to the president of Mexico. I don't know

[01:21:26.890 --> 01:21:28.490]
Sure or his brother

[01:21:29.130 --> 01:21:34.010]
You might ask him to comment on that. That is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard nice

[01:21:35.550 --> 01:21:40.190]
Five bucks in other words if I write you would check now. How about if it's on the same bank? How if it's uh the check

[01:21:40.190 --> 01:21:41.690]
Our wait is on their bank on city bank

[01:21:42.610 --> 01:21:45.770]
They will ask me if I'm an account holder

[01:21:45.770 --> 01:21:50.650]
I don't have to prove it if I say yes they waive the five dollars charge uh-huh

[01:21:51.190 --> 01:21:52.330]
If I say no

[01:21:53.070 --> 01:21:55.710]
They'll deduct five dollars great beautiful

[01:21:56.370 --> 01:22:01.410]
Wonderful story. Okay. I got a check for you for five and a quarter pal. Thank you. Be right over. Yeah. See you

[01:22:01.890 --> 01:22:06.670]
Okay, we have no it see this is just I'm glad that this came up the last two days even in a very perverse and

[01:22:06.670 --> 01:22:08.630]
Massacistic way because I really don't need the grief

[01:22:09.450 --> 01:22:14.430]
But uh there are just so many nightmarish things that these bastards are doing to people and it's uh

[01:22:14.430 --> 01:22:18.950]
You know the the amount of regulation that goes on we're supposed to be being protected against all this crap

[01:22:18.950 --> 01:22:21.170]
But generally speaking they do whatever the hell they want

[01:22:22.090 --> 01:22:26.090]
And so instead of holding your check for like five years now they can only hold it for a year or whatever

[01:22:26.090 --> 01:22:32.610]
I mean it's just stupid they get credit for the money immediately and in the meantime you sit and wait until they're good and ready to give you credit for it

[01:22:33.990 --> 01:22:35.230]
Here's plantation hello

[01:22:35.950 --> 01:22:41.330]
Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. How you doing my name is Matt and I am the branch manager at family bank at sargrass

[01:22:41.330 --> 01:22:47.190]
Yes, sir one of my customers just came in here and said that the western branch tried to shanghai your account from me

[01:22:47.190 --> 01:22:52.070]
Yes, he did I just wanted to make sure that don't don't let them pull that crap on you come right down here

[01:22:52.070 --> 01:22:57.450]
I tried to explain to her that uh, I live right by your your right at sunrise in flamenco right that's right

[01:22:57.450 --> 01:23:02.790]
I live I could throw a gigantic brick for my house right through your window because I live that close not that I want to yet

[01:23:03.610 --> 01:23:07.890]
Well, I hope it doesn't come at that point, but listen I I really don't listen to you that much

[01:23:07.890 --> 01:23:10.230]
But I have the I've had the radio on here

[01:23:10.830 --> 01:23:17.390]
Listening to you and man, I can't believe how pissed off people are at banks. They are and they keep getting screwed over no

[01:23:17.390 --> 01:23:20.410]
Look, I don't need the grief. I don't need the aggravation

[01:23:20.410 --> 01:23:24.010]
I'm not being a hard-ass, but when they screw you over about the 10th or 15th time

[01:23:24.010 --> 01:23:27.250]
You keep making the same mistakes. I mean your patients starts running out

[01:23:27.250 --> 01:23:34.170]
Hey, well all I got to say is that the more these big banks keep doing that the more this bank is going to grow and be super because

[01:23:34.870 --> 01:23:38.310]
I every day people are coming here saying oh I'm pissed a great western

[01:23:38.310 --> 01:23:42.910]
I'm ticked off at nation's bank or net and that's the niche that we're filling out here. So

[01:23:43.870 --> 01:23:48.710]
I guarantee you'll be happy here, and I'm sure you'll have nothing good to say nothing but good stuff to say

[01:23:48.710 --> 01:23:53.330]
So you're also going to give me my zidian checks free like she was going to do over at the other place anything you want

[01:23:53.330 --> 01:23:56.870]
Man, everything is totally free. I'll say good carry it

[01:23:56.870 --> 01:24:03.570]
By the way my my mom is from Sicily and this guy that knows you I guess says you're a big fan of the godfather's right

[01:24:03.570 --> 01:24:10.310]
Like Italy love it, but I look forward to meeting you man. Okay, so I come and see you. Yep. Just ask for Matt

[01:24:10.310 --> 01:24:15.730]
I'm the manager out here. Okay. Will you be there tomorrow afternoon? I will make it. I'll make a point to be here. I will see you then

[01:24:15.730 --> 01:24:21.010]
Okay, look forward to thanks, Matt bye bye. Okay, so I'm gonna go see Matt. I'm gonna shine mod. Sorry mod Matt

[01:24:21.010 --> 01:24:25.950]
Stoy your way. Well, it's just I'm lazy like most people plus let's face it when you got a bank right down the corner

[01:24:25.950 --> 01:24:30.310]
You're not gonna go all the way down there to where is that where like William R and western? I'm not gonna go down here

[01:24:30.870 --> 01:24:36.490]
We have an open line in date 751. We got two and Howard five two four nine four six three five two four

[01:24:36.490 --> 01:24:40.730]
WIOD and one on the green line one eight hundred nine four four WIOD

[01:24:41.650 --> 01:24:46.770]
So based on what I just heard moments ago. I guess on Monday. We're gonna find out what's gonna happen on Monday

[01:24:47.790 --> 01:24:52.450]
Do you know what I'm saying in other words people like D for wondering if he's still gonna be with us

[01:24:52.990 --> 01:24:56.090]
We don't know until Monday until the takeover actually takes place

[01:24:56.090 --> 01:24:59.490]
Who's gonna be on who's on first is this who's gonna be the program director?

[01:24:59.790 --> 01:25:01.850]
Who's gonna be on overnight who's in charge?

[01:25:02.130 --> 01:25:03.110]
Are we getting paid?

[01:25:04.030 --> 01:25:08.610]
Which I could tell that story too, but I'd like to find out the answer first. I mean that's another great uh

[01:25:08.610 --> 01:25:12.850]
Well, uh paid he wants to get paid yeah, I'd like to get paid like maybe once in a while would be good

[01:25:12.850 --> 01:25:14.790]
It's something for us to think about maybe talk about

[01:25:15.210 --> 01:25:16.910]
That's part of the deal like once in a while

[01:25:19.150 --> 01:25:20.830]

My foot John really gets my panties in a while ladies

[01:25:25.630 --> 01:25:30.170]
Why spend harder money on different feminine hygiene products when all you need is one

[01:25:31.330 --> 01:25:37.670]
That's right. I'll new Vagia magic is over 22 feminine hygiene products in one just listen for cramps

Just sprinkle some Vagia magic on that dull Monday night be loaf and we guarantee there won't be any leftovers

[01:26:13.410 --> 01:26:17.770]
Hmm great Vagia loaf mom why if we didn't have court cases pending with the FDA

[01:26:41.210 --> 01:26:45.190]
1138 22 till noon at wiod as we continue in the dark here

[01:26:45.190 --> 01:26:49.090]
We have three days left after today three more shows and then all of a sudden the Cox

[01:26:50.290 --> 01:26:55.570]
Interest in this radio station now that was a bad way of putting it because Cox's interest in this radio station ended months ago

[01:26:56.150 --> 01:26:57.370]
Many my maybe years ago

[01:26:57.370 --> 01:27:04.090]
But their financial interest in the station ends as of this weekend sometime either Friday or Monday morning or a chavuis or whatever

[01:27:04.090 --> 01:27:08.530]
And then the Paxen people would be here on Monday and maybe maybe we'll find out who's on first

[01:27:09.570 --> 01:27:11.350]
Here's highly on a purple line hello

[01:27:11.990 --> 01:27:13.950]
Hi there Neil how you doing okay sir?

[01:27:14.450 --> 01:27:18.330]
Why listen? I just wanted to clarify one thing here on this quarterback issue

[01:27:19.010 --> 01:27:23.430]
The one car he called it was heading out of Pittsburgh doing this you know with Miller and Stewart

[01:27:24.070 --> 01:27:27.530]
The first game of the season Miller and Stewart weren't put it together

[01:27:27.530 --> 01:27:31.470]
They put Tom's that can then realize about the rule apparently

[01:27:31.470 --> 01:27:39.070]
I believe it was the first or second quarter the first play that Tom's that was in he throws the interception and the other two guys are out until

[01:27:39.630 --> 01:27:43.830]
The fourth quarter no they they said until overtime and that oh really?

[01:27:44.130 --> 01:27:46.710]
Yeah, so I mean and the reason is you know

[01:27:46.710 --> 01:27:51.290]
There's was the inactive type situation you can have three quarterbacks if you want

[01:27:51.890 --> 01:27:59.250]
That's why I understood it was it's the inactive quarterback you can have you know you can have three you can have five quarterbacks

[01:27:59.250 --> 01:28:02.690]
Active on a roster if you want if they're all listed as active correct correct

[01:28:03.230 --> 01:28:07.990]
So but it is a bizarre rule and whatnot and I just wanted to point that out and

[01:28:08.470 --> 01:28:13.650]
Appreciate the time let me talk here and enjoy your show even whatever happens after Friday, you know

[01:28:14.290 --> 01:28:19.730]
I'm not going anywhere. I'll be here. You could be an easy listing station. Okay pal take it easy see

[01:28:19.730 --> 01:28:23.910]
Okay, that's it. We're gonna be playing easy Perry Como and Tony Bennett

[01:28:23.910 --> 01:28:27.430]
He made a big comeback. We're gonna be playing a lot of easy listing music Peggy Lee and

[01:28:28.710 --> 01:28:30.930]
Syruvon we're gonna be playing some real easy music

[01:28:30.930 --> 01:28:35.110]
It's gonna be dreamy and it's gonna be great won't offend anybody it'll be beautiful thing

[01:28:35.110 --> 01:28:37.990]
I love it go get grant the wayward the wayward wind

[01:28:39.510 --> 01:28:45.770]
We have an open line in brass songs from before you were even an idea before you were in embryo on six 10 W I O D

[01:28:45.770 --> 01:28:51.330]
Open line of Broward 5249 463524 W I O D here's poppin O hello

[01:28:51.730 --> 01:28:56.290]
Born in the ill yes, sir. Hey, what whatever happened on on Friday when you're left early

[01:28:57.170 --> 01:29:02.750]
Whatever happened with what you on the air for a couple hours. I went out of town for the weekend. Oh you did? Yes, sir

[01:29:02.750 --> 01:29:06.430]
Okay, no one knew no one seemed to know what was going on and fiddle came on into his

[01:29:06.430 --> 01:29:08.790]
Well see I'll tell you what happened is that um

[01:29:08.790 --> 01:29:11.630]
US air which I had another good experience. I like US air

[01:29:11.630 --> 01:29:13.730]
It's my second time using them and I'm sure I'll use them again

[01:29:13.730 --> 01:29:17.690]
The only thing I don't like about them is they have a habit of changing flight times

[01:29:17.690 --> 01:29:22.170]
Like very very late in other words you may have tickets for weeks okay to go somewhere

[01:29:22.170 --> 01:29:25.730]
Yes, and then all of a sudden they they call you at least they call you which is nice

[01:29:25.730 --> 01:29:30.130]
And they say oh guess what you know your flight on such and such a date. Well, we just moved it up an hour

[01:29:30.590 --> 01:29:33.390]
So they just sent you running out of there to get your plane on time right

[01:29:34.170 --> 01:29:38.350]
Okay, secondly have you been watching Chris Burman on Monday night halftime highlights no

[01:29:38.350 --> 01:29:43.410]
Do you like Chris Burman? Yeah, I like Chris Burman, but to me he's like a banana split

[01:29:43.410 --> 01:29:48.950]
You know once in a while one is really delicious, but too much of it is just sickeningly sweet and Chris Burman

[01:29:49.390 --> 01:29:53.050]
I'm not I think I've been over Chris Burman. You know, I'm oversaturated

[01:29:53.050 --> 01:29:56.430]
Well, I saw very amusing quote in the paper a couple of weeks ago

[01:29:56.430 --> 01:30:03.390]
Gentlemen by the name of Norman chat had written that having Chris Burman hosts the Monday night halftime highlights is like having father

[01:30:03.390 --> 01:30:06.510]
Guido Sarducci preside over Christmas Mass at the Vatican

[01:30:07.790 --> 01:30:12.670]
Yeah, and I think that's quite appropriate. Okay, and for my opinion. I hope Defoe goes

[01:30:12.670 --> 01:30:16.670]
I'm tired of his monologues. I'm tired of him having to use Dr. Kavorki in a nevery

[01:30:18.450 --> 01:30:22.650]
I like to see him go through one newscast without saying that though the dolphin defense

[01:30:22.650 --> 01:30:27.610]
The dolphin offense last night was searching for Dr. Kavorki and so I was waiting for a call from Dr. Kavorki

[01:30:27.610 --> 01:30:30.030]
You know what I think that is I think that's a Steve Nichol thing

[01:30:30.030 --> 01:30:35.850]
I really do because he never used to do any of that and I think that the under he's been taken under the wing of our program director

[01:30:35.850 --> 01:30:39.130]
And that Steve Nichol has encouraged him to do these silly

[01:30:39.130 --> 01:30:41.970]
puns and all this and and just and and never ending

[01:30:42.690 --> 01:30:48.610]
Succession of those things. I agree with you. I I like Defoe much much better before when he was just doing the stuff and being himself

[01:30:48.610 --> 01:30:53.890]
And given the information and having some fun as opposed to trying to be a sit-down comic all the time

[01:30:53.890 --> 01:30:57.710]
Does he really write out his his monologues you say he had done in the past?

[01:30:57.910 --> 01:31:00.730]
Does he sit down and have things written out like his monologue to oh?

[01:31:00.870 --> 01:31:04.090]
I never said that about did I ever say that I think you've joked about it a few times

[01:31:04.090 --> 01:31:08.490]
Maybe he does. I don't know. I certainly those liners he must write those down because nobody could think of those

[01:31:08.490 --> 01:31:13.130]
It really sounds like it's totally scripted when he comes down the air for the first five or six minutes of the show

[01:31:13.130 --> 01:31:14.890]
Well, maybe he learned it from Mike Spindell

[01:31:14.890 --> 01:31:16.770]
Have a great day pal. Thank you Neil. See you

[01:31:16.770 --> 01:31:21.690]
Okay, so Defoe's out. We have all the lines in Broward wide open out. What the hell just happened there?

[01:31:21.910 --> 01:31:24.070]
Everybody's on a way to family bank note out to see Matt

[01:31:25.550 --> 01:31:32.170]
5249 463 524 w. I. O. D. and an open line on a green line 1 800 944 speaking of the green line in Palm Beach

[01:31:32.170 --> 01:31:38.070]
Somebody also sends me a great clipping from the local news of the Palm Beach post September 19 which is the last Thursday

[01:31:40.210 --> 01:31:45.690]
Speaking of that good old-time religion and here's a picture of this is I mean now is this a public school

[01:31:45.690 --> 01:31:49.590]
Maybe this is not a public school. I don't know because I'm just reading the the blurb here

[01:31:50.230 --> 01:31:54.850]
It says green acres Sherry and Brian Jackson teachers at John I Leonard High School

[01:31:54.850 --> 01:31:57.170]
Which doesn't sound like a parochial school to me

[01:31:57.770 --> 01:32:03.270]
Join more than 80 students at the flagpole to pray for the country in their school wins they before class

[01:32:03.270 --> 01:32:08.850]
The third Wednesday in September was see you at the pole prayer day at John I Leonard High

[01:32:10.870 --> 01:32:13.150]
See you at your pole prayer day

[01:32:15.650 --> 01:32:16.190]
You know

[01:32:16.190 --> 01:32:16.790]
In a public school

[01:32:18.530 --> 01:32:22.570]
Okay, whatever you say whatever this is America. Okay, they just don't get it. They don't understand

[01:32:22.570 --> 01:32:24.970]
Just leave me alone with your religion. Just put it where

[01:32:25.550 --> 01:32:28.910]
Radio stations like to show off their awards for news

[01:32:28.910 --> 01:32:33.310]
But only one radio station wins the award from the only judges who count

[01:32:34.230 --> 01:32:37.790]
Listen to the radio top of mind number one

[01:32:38.430 --> 01:32:41.290]
News talk and entertainment radio six ten

[01:32:41.290 --> 01:32:49.330]
W.I.O.D. I want to give you a kiss hey if you're thinking of having sex without protection you better think again

[01:32:49.330 --> 01:32:56.330]
Oh, this is making me so hot me too come on. Let's go all the way right here in the back seat of your car sure

[01:32:56.330 --> 01:32:59.330]
Um, okay, okay, you bring any protection?

[01:32:59.770 --> 01:33:00.310]
Protection

[01:33:00.310 --> 01:33:02.330]
Have sex if you didn't bring protection

[01:33:03.450 --> 01:33:08.350]
Darn look having sex without wearing a condom is like jumping out of a plane without wearing a parachute

[01:33:08.350 --> 01:33:11.030]
If you're not wearing one you ain't getting none

[01:33:12.410 --> 01:33:16.950]
I'm getting even hotter than I was last night too come on. Let's go all the way

[01:33:16.950 --> 01:33:23.510]
I told you not unless you brought protection. I did break protection. Here. Oh, yeah. It's a parachute a parachute

[01:33:23.510 --> 01:33:28.230]
Look, it's got a reservoir pep that's the reserve suit Paul my rip card baby

[01:33:28.230 --> 01:33:34.950]
Put your own rip card. Jirah. I always end up pulling my own rip card condoms go right up all

[01:33:36.010 --> 01:33:40.790]
Think of them as little parachutes for your penis. Okay, 1150 tendl noon at W.I.O.D

We got an open line and date we got the purple line. What did we do?

[01:33:43.410 --> 01:33:48.290]
Did we uh somebody fart in here real bad that we were rolling long singing a song and I was like the end all of a sudden

[01:33:48.290 --> 01:33:49.670]
It's that big brick wall again

[01:33:51.470 --> 01:33:57.130]
524 9463 all the lines in brown are wide open purple line mobile once L 18 T wireless bound I.O.D. etc

[01:33:57.750 --> 01:34:04.650]
Oh god here we go again. Here's the lady in Miami. Hello. Hello. Neil. How are you? Okay. Okay. Let me tell you what happens to me on Friday

[01:34:05.190 --> 01:34:09.830]
I went to the bank. I deposited a check for $3006 306

[01:34:09.830 --> 01:34:15.990]
Yes, when I got my slip I looked at it. It said 296

[01:34:15.990 --> 01:34:21.450]
How many moments was the amount? I would I deposited 306 306 and it was 296

[01:34:21.450 --> 01:34:23.870]
The slip is telling me 296 right

[01:34:23.870 --> 01:34:27.270]
So I went back inside and I said listen I deposited a check

[01:34:27.270 --> 01:34:31.750]
Oh the guy ready ready for me long time. I said look let me speak to the supervisor

[01:34:32.190 --> 01:34:37.690]
She came out to say listen I just deposited a check for 306 this thing is telling me 296

[01:34:37.690 --> 01:34:41.610]
That's a nice even $10 is missing right maybe the teller had to go to lunch

[01:34:42.610 --> 01:34:43.710]
Yeah, that's right

[01:34:43.710 --> 01:34:49.370]
So anyway she went back today to the teller she says this lady said she put the check in for 306

[01:34:49.370 --> 01:34:51.750]
She says no I don't think that I don't make the kind of mistakes

[01:34:52.310 --> 01:34:55.850]
So anyway when you look back on the check the check was the 306 right

[01:34:55.850 --> 01:35:01.850]
So of course the wrote me a letter and said there were sorry about him is understanding and accredited my account back for

[01:35:02.730 --> 01:35:03.530]
$10 yeah

[01:35:03.530 --> 01:35:08.610]
So these are the kind of things that happen if I didn't go back in if you if you wouldn't have looked at the receipt

[01:35:08.610 --> 01:35:12.770]
You wouldn't have even known it exactly and he would have pocketed my $10 before today

[01:35:12.770 --> 01:35:17.570]
Maybe this is a scam that's going on maybe there maybe there are tellers I mean tellers are very underpaid

[01:35:17.570 --> 01:35:21.070]
They work for probably less than minimum wage and they got the first grade education

[01:35:21.070 --> 01:35:27.950]
And many years ago Neil when I went the bank used to be a mere first before grade restaurant right before my first one under right

[01:35:27.950 --> 01:35:34.150]
Yeah, I went to the bank and I deposited $60 and when I went to my car and I look at the slip it says with draw

[01:35:34.150 --> 01:35:38.750]
$60 I went back inside this Cuban lady didn't speak no English

[01:35:38.750 --> 01:35:44.410]
Finally she got someone who could understood me because she said I'm on I'm speaking so fast right

[01:35:44.410 --> 01:35:52.550]
All right, she went to the asset list. Mom. I deposited $60 this thing says I'll withdraw $60 and $60 is deducted from my balance

[01:35:53.030 --> 01:35:58.070]
What's this? She says mom? I don't think you know what your sales went on and on a rather big argument

[01:35:58.070 --> 01:36:03.270]
She called security and everything really yeah, she called security and everything you know because Jamaicans when we get upset

[01:36:03.270 --> 01:36:04.550]
We rail areas hell

[01:36:04.550 --> 01:36:10.610]
You know and so anyway security says calm down calm down. They went to the teller

[01:36:10.610 --> 01:36:13.930]
She says to tell it do you remember this lady at your desk?

[01:36:13.930 --> 01:36:19.150]
I said who would know me I'm so tall I'm 511 you should know I am said yes, I remembered her

[01:36:19.150 --> 01:36:23.130]
She said did she deposit or withdraw she said no should deposit it $60

[01:36:24.270 --> 01:36:27.430]
The supervisor said what are papers or a slip is saying

[01:36:27.430 --> 01:36:28.370]
It's wrong

[01:36:30.110 --> 01:36:32.970]
Oh brother has been deducted from her balance

[01:36:33.530 --> 01:36:36.250]
So she told us to say try not to make these mistakes anymore

[01:36:36.250 --> 01:36:41.050]
But in the meantime I would be out of $60 right because this was cash money

[01:36:41.050 --> 01:36:46.490]
So 60 and the 10 from Friday and we're already up to 70 exactly and this is going on every day

[01:36:46.490 --> 01:36:51.070]
Which is by a real nice dinner like at Ruth Kriss Steakhouse for a couple of the tellers at the bank

[01:36:51.070 --> 01:36:54.550]
That's what is going on here you're depriving starving people are some nice meals

[01:36:54.550 --> 01:36:56.910]
They just want to go out on the weekend and have one good meal. That's all

[01:36:56.910 --> 01:37:01.470]
Of course what about these people who are going to see an island stuff like that they go there deposit them on

[01:37:01.470 --> 01:37:03.650]
They believe in the bunker especially here

[01:37:03.650 --> 01:37:07.710]
Can you imagine here in Florida with all these seen-out old parts to be gone? Oh

[01:37:07.710 --> 01:37:10.870]
I take the slip and put it in the purse and they don't look at it

[01:37:10.870 --> 01:37:15.270]
They must be salivating when they see these people come to the window that's right and at the end of the day

[01:37:15.270 --> 01:37:18.790]
When the money is over they pocket it because I used to work at the bank in Jamaica

[01:37:18.790 --> 01:37:24.330]
I know exactly how when you deposit and what goes on right at the end of the day they pocket that's money

[01:37:24.330 --> 01:37:27.010]
Beautiful, you know something maybe that's what it is

[01:37:27.010 --> 01:37:31.430]
Maybe it's not that the tellers aren't making much money while we you know because every week there's different tellers

[01:37:31.430 --> 01:37:33.110]
It's not that they're not making a lot of money

[01:37:33.110 --> 01:37:36.910]
It's just they're making so much money that they got enough to well leave town at the end of a couple of weeks

[01:37:36.910 --> 01:37:37.430]
Exactly

[01:37:38.470 --> 01:37:44.210]
All right something is going on. Okay, but the better don't play with my money. I'm getting me a new job on Monday

[01:37:44.210 --> 01:37:48.630]
Okay, okay sweetheart. Thanks a lot. I'm going to Haitians bank sounds good to me

[01:37:49.210 --> 01:37:54.130]
Two open lines in day and 7519 463 751 let me rip off your money come on

[01:37:54.130 --> 01:37:58.650]
Give me just don't look at the receipt all right in fact. I won't even give you a receipt. You trust me. Don't you? I'm a banker

[01:37:59.770 --> 01:38:01.550]
Here's a mobile in the Palm Beach hello

[01:38:01.550 --> 01:38:06.430]
Hey, Neil. How you doing? Okay, sir? Hey, I little banking anecdote. I work in coconut grove

[01:38:06.430 --> 01:38:08.390]
I live in Pembroke pine and

[01:38:08.990 --> 01:38:16.070]
The place that I work at in coconut grove is out of state there the payroll checks come from Ohio right and I was doing business

[01:38:16.670 --> 01:38:22.450]
The place that I work had made an arrangement with a a branch of this bank in coconut grove to

[01:38:23.250 --> 01:38:28.150]
Cash paychecks for the employees and to handle things without putting a humongous hold on them

[01:38:28.150 --> 01:38:31.010]
So I open an account at the branch down there

[01:38:31.870 --> 01:38:34.610]
In coconut grove and when I moved to Pembroke pines

[01:38:35.170 --> 01:38:41.110]
I just thought it'd be easier to do business with the same bank by having my business at the branch in Pembroke pines

[01:38:41.110 --> 01:38:46.270]
So I go up there and I close my account in coconut grove and I reopen with the same bank

[01:38:46.950 --> 01:38:53.250]
In Pembroke pines and I went into deposit my paycheck and like a week later I'm bouncing checks

[01:38:53.810 --> 01:38:55.290]
And I said what's going on now?

[01:38:55.410 --> 01:38:58.650]
This is the same branch that I had actually gone in and deposited my paychecks

[01:38:59.310 --> 01:39:02.310]
In Pembroke pines and and because you know

[01:39:02.310 --> 01:39:05.670]
They could look up on their computer that there were supposed to be no hold placed on the check right

[01:39:06.770 --> 01:39:08.790]
Through the branch in coconut grove

[01:39:08.790 --> 01:39:14.990]
So I'm talking you know

[01:39:15.790 --> 01:39:18.330]
I open the account up there and the next thing I know

[01:39:19.110 --> 01:39:22.350]
They're telling me that they have to put a hold on because it's a new account

[01:39:23.950 --> 01:39:24.890]
It's a new account?

[01:39:25.110 --> 01:39:28.690]
Yeah, when I when I reopen my account, you know with the same bank

[01:39:28.690 --> 01:39:31.150]
Yeah, well when I open a different branch in Pembroke pines

[01:39:31.150 --> 01:39:32.850]
That's a good story. That's a new twist anyway

[01:39:33.570 --> 01:39:38.470]
They said it's a new account and so I ended up you know bouncing a bunch of checks at 29 bucks a pop

[01:39:39.270 --> 01:39:42.090]
Uh, and and needless to say I don't do business with them anymore

[01:39:42.450 --> 01:39:45.890]
It is appropriate though that their initials are f you. I think that's interesting

[01:39:45.890 --> 01:39:49.450]
Okay, thank you and they're first in my mind. Yeah, okay

[01:39:50.070 --> 01:39:53.290]
Okay, we're coming to a halt here. I think I'm gonna catch your plane at noon again today

[01:39:53.290 --> 01:39:54.950]
That was a pretty good deal. I worked out really well

[01:39:54.950 --> 01:39:57.470]
I think a two hours is more than enough for for this crowd

[01:39:58.470 --> 01:40:03.350]
751 W. I. O D in day five two four nine four six three and brown one eight hundred nine four four

[01:40:03.350 --> 01:40:08.250]
W I. O D in a green line if anybody out there has any good rumors about what's gonna be happening here next week

[01:40:08.250 --> 01:40:11.730]
We cheer like to hear him because anywhere if you heard the acts the programmer

[01:40:11.730 --> 01:40:14.530]
Actually, we have a show called the program director acts himself

[01:40:15.650 --> 01:40:18.970]
Unlike over at Q. A. M. Where they have fat hank on there with a acid and woods guy

[01:40:18.970 --> 01:40:24.090]
We just have a guy come on here slightly inebriated on Sunday morning who talks to himself and

[01:40:24.090 --> 01:40:31.110]
writes memos on a year and talks about all this other fall to all and the fact that he's gonna go off to a seek his fortune to LA and program the Philan

[01:40:31.110 --> 01:40:31.430]
Re Show

[01:40:32.530 --> 01:40:36.290]
Here's the lady in North Miami Beach. Hello, hi Neil. How you doing? Okay, okay?

[01:40:36.410 --> 01:40:41.330]
Let me just tell you a horror story that probably miss the public better where I'm I want to cash my check

[01:40:41.330 --> 01:40:43.590]
Okay, and I got like hundred dollar bills

[01:40:43.590 --> 01:40:50.050]
So I didn't check the hundred dollar bills. I went to another bank to deposit the hundred dollar bills right my check and account

[01:40:50.050 --> 01:40:55.750]
Bank teller tells me I have a four I have a counterfeit hundred dollar bill that I got from nation's bank, right?

[01:40:56.550 --> 01:41:01.110]
By this time nation's banks are already closed and I'm crazy because I'm at a hundred dollars, right?

[01:41:01.710 --> 01:41:04.830]
So the next morning Saturday morning I go in there and I

[01:41:04.830 --> 01:41:09.530]
I say to them, you know, she said something under normal circumstances

[01:41:10.070 --> 01:41:12.150]
There's nothing we normally would do

[01:41:12.150 --> 01:41:15.690]
But cause we know you when you've been a customer for like 10 years

[01:41:15.690 --> 01:41:19.790]
We will take the hundred dollar bill and give you a new one, right? Yeah

[01:41:20.050 --> 01:41:26.490]
And pawn it off on somebody else right however if I if I was you know an average Joe off the street

[01:41:26.490 --> 01:41:29.790]
They would have been half a hundred dollars. Yeah, get it no good, right?

[01:41:30.270 --> 01:41:33.210]
So when you go to cash and large check and you 100 dollar bills

[01:41:33.210 --> 01:41:38.930]
You just tell that teller to verify that those are real hundred dollar bills whatever they have to do

[01:41:38.930 --> 01:41:44.170]
You know and then the same dumb bank. I'm like it's smuck a real honest person, right?

[01:41:44.470 --> 01:41:47.230]
I go to the bank to get changed for the store and I get 51

[01:41:47.230 --> 01:41:51.910]
So I give away 50 more like it back to the store. I open up the pack, right?

[01:41:52.570 --> 01:41:57.430]
One dollar on the top the rest are 50 all right, right?

[01:41:58.070 --> 01:41:58.770]
Don't need me

[01:41:59.890 --> 01:42:04.430]
Right sounds like 2500 bucks to me. Absolutely right dummy me

[01:42:04.430 --> 01:42:09.110]
Yeah, if I'm a nice guy figured right I go back to the bank, right?

[01:42:09.670 --> 01:42:13.670]
And I go to the teller who happens to be a Haitian lady and she still works there

[01:42:13.670 --> 01:42:18.850]
Yeah, I say to her I think you should look at this right? She says to me

[01:42:19.390 --> 01:42:26.330]
Why I said look at it so she opened it up. She sees a dollar on the top and the rest and 50 yeah, ran crisp

[01:42:26.870 --> 01:42:30.930]
Do you say it thinks she said thank you drop dead nothing

[01:42:32.170 --> 01:42:35.270]
She said nothing to me nothing nothing not

[01:42:35.270 --> 01:42:40.530]
I guarantee you that you would have been responsible for it. Absolutely just like the tellers at the track

[01:42:40.530 --> 01:42:42.670]
I bet you those tellers in a bank, you know, they have to

[01:42:43.370 --> 01:42:46.110]
Do an accounting at the end of the day and if they're short they got a

[01:42:46.510 --> 01:42:49.630]
Belly up the cash. So I think you're on a nice guy, right?

[01:42:49.930 --> 01:42:56.470]
I'm like she says thank you, but the bottom line of the story is I go in the next week to the same teller

[01:42:56.470 --> 01:43:03.850]
Yeah, to make it the positive. I'm the lady. He just brought her back 2500 dollars. Yeah, she asked me for a driver's license

[01:43:04.630 --> 01:43:06.270]
I went nuts

[01:43:06.990 --> 01:43:11.430]
Inc. Able nut I was at that window. I was screaming

[01:43:12.270 --> 01:43:17.530]
I was like a crazy woman. I said I'm gonna come over this counter and choke you

[01:43:17.530 --> 01:43:23.330]
You're asking me for a driver's license. I'm depositing my check and I brought you back 2500

[01:43:23.330 --> 01:43:29.110]
Save your ass last week and you forgot already on grateful bitch on grateful sound can you believe that yes?

[01:43:29.710 --> 01:43:35.450]
Put around a banana boat. Absolutely. Okay, sweetheart. Good luck. Bye. Bye. Okay, she gave back to 2500

[01:43:36.310 --> 01:43:39.010]

[01:45:02.470 --> 01:45:03.770]
Just pray for it Neal

[01:45:04.450 --> 01:45:07.870]
Listen Neal calling because I was listening to you a while ago and there's a

[01:45:07.870 --> 01:45:09.730]
You turn your show book on

[01:45:10.250 --> 01:45:12.790]
Religion or something that exposes the

[01:45:13.470 --> 01:45:16.270]
Fairy tales in the Bible and I wanted to get the name of the book

[01:45:16.970 --> 01:45:18.170]
The name of what book?

[01:45:18.830 --> 01:45:21.470]
I heard you had talked about her about six months ago. I'll book you had read

[01:45:21.870 --> 01:45:23.510]
That exposed a lot of the

[01:45:24.070 --> 01:45:26.530]
Other time period of the Bible or whatnot or

[01:45:27.470 --> 01:45:31.970]
You know what I'm talking about not in the least in Georgia's got his eyebrows. The second call we've had in his

[01:45:31.970 --> 01:45:35.070]
Yeah, I don't think so about right about some book that I allegedly that

[01:45:35.570 --> 01:45:40.750]
Yeah, it's about six or seven months ago. Yeah, I've read books about exposing it

[01:45:40.750 --> 01:45:44.170]
But I'm not sure if it was religion yeah, right? Yeah, I don't know

[01:45:44.630 --> 01:45:49.870]
Listen if it comes to your mind just mention or I'll be listening to you all day. Okay pal. All right. Bye. See it. God bless you

[01:45:50.290 --> 01:45:53.630]
Okay, we're coming down to a precious few now. We're coming down to Luis Miguel time

[01:45:53.630 --> 01:45:56.410]
I'll write wish you'd be good quality time for me to go over some bank statements

[01:45:56.410 --> 01:46:02.710]
We have two open lines and date 751. We got all of Broward and what can be going on up there? You don't kipper was yesterday, man

[01:46:04.230 --> 01:46:06.010]
W I O D Neal

[01:46:06.410 --> 01:46:08.870]
What did you just did it just ring? Yeah

[01:46:09.870 --> 01:46:13.370]
Um that guy was probably talking about a bulliocese book the outrage

[01:46:13.370 --> 01:46:18.590]
Said that there is a party about Christianity in that book. Yeah, and it's not about Christianity. It's about God

[01:46:19.030 --> 01:46:21.410]
Oh, okay, well the Jewish God the Christian God the

[01:46:21.970 --> 01:46:27.710]
Fairytale God whatever God you want to call him. Yeah, but that but that's not that that's not what the book is about the book is about the

[01:46:27.710 --> 01:46:31.350]
OJ right right right, but you did you did talk about that for a little bit

[01:46:31.350 --> 01:46:34.110]
Yeah, and that's the only thing that's what he's thinking about it

[01:46:34.110 --> 01:46:35.930]
In fact, even if he doesn't care about OJ

[01:46:35.930 --> 01:46:42.910]
It's worth getting the book just to go it's about three quarters of the way in the back of the book where he makes the very logical argument against the existence of God

[01:46:42.910 --> 01:46:48.070]
Right and does it very well? Well, I just wanted to contribute something to your show there. Thank you so much pal

[01:46:48.070 --> 01:46:54.390]
Can I call someone to do sure? Yes, sir? Chris Bonnodonna do you expect oh God? Okay? Oh my god. We were reduced to that, huh

[01:46:55.150 --> 01:46:57.090]
That's how far we fall in at this point

[01:46:57.970 --> 01:46:59.990]
You know, it's a damn good thing that I had this

[01:46:59.990 --> 01:47:04.430]
Contra Thompson with the bank because it sure as hell killed the last uh show in a half. I'll tell you that

[01:47:04.950 --> 01:47:08.830]
Because based on the nature of these people out there one thing about these last few months

[01:47:08.830 --> 01:47:15.390]
You know, I can always write it in my memoirs the audience sure didn't let us down after the Cox people let us just float off into oblivion

[01:47:15.390 --> 01:47:19.890]
The audience really was there to support us and lend their tangible support not

[01:47:20.650 --> 01:47:22.710]
Wow, it's been swell

[01:47:23.930 --> 01:47:29.190]
Here's Miami. Hello, any oh, yes, sir. I think the book the guy's talking about

[01:47:29.710 --> 01:47:32.910]
It in the name has something like about Calcutta

[01:47:34.370 --> 01:47:34.850]
Oh

[01:47:34.850 --> 01:47:35.490]
Calcutta

[01:47:35.490 --> 01:47:38.710]
No, I don't know if this oh Calcutta Calcutta right

[01:47:40.430 --> 01:47:45.990]
Yeah, that was it you talked about it about three four months ago the name of the book had something to do with Calcutta

[01:47:45.990 --> 01:47:51.330]
Yes, and it's from a real um major author that you're always uh talking about

[01:47:51.870 --> 01:47:56.130]
But for the life of me, I cannot remember the guy's name, but it's very uh, it's a very

[01:47:56.790 --> 01:48:01.050]
Famous guy very famous author. Yeah, but the name of this particular book

[01:48:01.570 --> 01:48:08.830]
Is something Calcutta that's as much as I can remember something Calcutta right, but I don't remember what the something part is

[01:48:09.450 --> 01:48:11.510]
I couldn't be oh could it

[01:48:11.510 --> 01:48:13.390]
It could be but I don't think so

[01:48:14.010 --> 01:48:18.710]
Okay, listen you gave us half a loaf that's a good start. Let me give you a bank horror story, okay

[01:48:19.290 --> 01:48:23.430]
Barnett bank says I know that uh your friend in the morning was bragging about

[01:48:23.430 --> 01:48:26.910]
As soon as Rick Riley said Barnett bank I crossed him off my list

[01:48:27.650 --> 01:48:30.730]
That has to be by far one of the worst

[01:48:31.050 --> 01:48:34.890]
I'll try to make this brief yeah several months ago

[01:48:35.610 --> 01:48:40.250]
I had a similar problem of what you had I take I deposit a cashier's check

[01:48:40.910 --> 01:48:49.230]
From another bank in Miami, okay, they placed a hold against the item, okay, I didn't that I was not notified that they have placed a hold

[01:48:49.230 --> 01:48:55.150]
I wrote some checks against it. Of course they bounced right to make the long story short

[01:48:56.450 --> 01:48:59.710]
After all of that got clarified and the bank admitted to their

[01:48:59.710 --> 01:49:06.310]
Uh problem and what have you and letters were written the whole nine years of course the return checks were reported to the credit bureau

[01:49:06.970 --> 01:49:15.930]
So I go ahead and I had lost my ATM card with Barnett. I requested a replacement. Guess what they denied my request for an ATM card

[01:49:15.930 --> 01:49:21.770]
Because my credit report showed the return checks that they bounce that they bounce because of their own flaw

[01:49:22.510 --> 01:49:27.130]
Nice so so when are you opening the account? Oh

[01:49:27.690 --> 01:49:31.630]
God unbelievable, okay, and I'll tell you this it took me

[01:49:32.290 --> 01:49:33.570]
Let's see when in September

[01:49:34.570 --> 01:49:42.350]
I just got this finally the replacement of the ATM card about three months of correspondence exchange time wasted at the main branch

[01:49:42.350 --> 01:49:48.370]
I talked to everybody and their mother at that branch. Yeah, finally get this situation clarified

[01:49:48.890 --> 01:49:52.110]
That those checks and I had to produce their letters

[01:49:52.750 --> 01:50:00.390]
Copy of the NSS checks copy of the deposit copy of the cashiers checks the whole story because of course the blame is always on the customer

[01:50:00.390 --> 01:50:05.070]
We're always the ones that are in here and we're always the deadbeat so we're always trying to pull a fast one

[01:50:05.070 --> 01:50:10.130]
We're always trying to spend money that we don't really have right the attitude that I was given with this

[01:50:10.950 --> 01:50:17.070]
They really and I have very I have a very short fuse. I have very little patience for that kind of attitude

[01:50:17.070 --> 01:50:21.850]
And I used to work in banking a long time ago. I started out in the business as a teller

[01:50:22.110 --> 01:50:29.010]
Okay, but the attitude that they gave me I mean, I feel like a deadbeat. I said oh man. That's it. I mean, I'm out of here

[01:50:29.010 --> 01:50:32.170]
I'm never even an ATM. This is not a credit card an ATM card

[01:50:32.930 --> 01:50:37.470]
My my question to them was will you tell him is regardless of that was your fault

[01:50:37.470 --> 01:50:40.810]
Will you tell him is that I cannot be granted?

[01:50:41.150 --> 01:50:48.110]
So in other words you're telling me that they send this information into the credit agency so that they screw up your credit

[01:50:48.110 --> 01:50:50.950]
That you were deadbeat and you're bouncing checks even though it's their mistake

[01:50:50.950 --> 01:50:54.930]
Absolutely and then when I ask for an ATM card and that a visa card

[01:50:55.510 --> 01:50:59.010]
An ATM card to get you down money out right or put it in

[01:50:59.010 --> 01:51:04.550]
Can give you one because your credit is messed up because of these three-bounce checks. Yes. Hope guess who made those checks bounce your idiot

[01:51:06.050 --> 01:51:11.690]
You know the word fire bomb comes to mind comes to mind pipe bomb. I had to I had to

[01:51:12.330 --> 01:51:13.490]
I thought about it

[01:51:13.490 --> 01:51:16.910]
All right, okay, see him Calcutta all right

[01:51:17.450 --> 01:51:23.290]
Two open lines in date Calcutta, huh? Okay, whatever he says maybe thinking of Miami's got a confused or Beirut

[01:51:24.470 --> 01:51:30.370]
7519 463 751 W. I. O. D. It's 1213 on a beautiful Tuesday, man. The sun is shining somewhere

[01:51:31.230 --> 01:51:34.650]
The summer back always having to promote the brand new morning show

[01:51:34.650 --> 01:51:40.550]
You're gonna love these guys are the best in the world. We'll tell you who they are. Go ahead. I can't think of their names

[01:51:40.550 --> 01:51:41.430]
Oh

[01:51:42.330 --> 01:51:44.750]
Good. No, I'm afraid of running

[01:51:45.830 --> 01:51:49.210]
Please run run it down on the walking with Chang

[01:51:49.890 --> 01:51:59.230]
Ha, hey, yeah, they're good all right then Rick and Suts 6 to 10 a.m. Mornings for a couple of more days on news talk and entertainment radio

[01:51:59.870 --> 01:52:06.010]
610 W. I. O. D. Where's my meat? So you think he really will be smarter any afternoon or what?

[01:52:06.710 --> 01:52:09.530]
1217 at W. I. O. D. We got 48 open lines in date

[01:52:09.950 --> 01:52:15.870]
122 and Broward. We're making a little comeback here. Not too good. Here's a bokeh. Hello. Hey, how you doing? Great

[01:52:16.310 --> 01:52:22.450]
Good listen, you know forget about bank horror stories. I got a Cox broadcast in horror story. Oh

[01:52:22.990 --> 01:52:27.670]
I'm telling you they're trying to get as much money out of that station as they can and they don't care who they alienate

[01:52:27.670 --> 01:52:28.410]
I was listening

[01:52:28.810 --> 01:52:34.910]
I watched the game and then I turned on I O. D. and heard Jim Manic with the locker room show. I want to give you a kiss

[01:52:34.910 --> 01:52:37.070]
Yeah, but then after that I'm turning

[01:52:37.070 --> 01:52:42.470]
on you know I was looking forward to talking to the game. I was you know I had a few you know beers during the game

[01:52:42.470 --> 01:52:46.190]
So I thought all right I'll call up and we'll talk football until I fall asleep. Yeah

[01:52:46.190 --> 01:52:51.590]
And they kept going stay tuned for sports talk with Kim Boe camper

[01:52:51.590 --> 01:52:57.890]
So they play about Ken commercials. Yeah, then they go next Kim Boe camper one of the killer bees

[01:52:58.430 --> 01:53:00.390]
And they play about five more commercials

[01:53:00.390 --> 01:53:04.710]
Stay tuned for sports talk right and then after all these commercials

[01:53:04.710 --> 01:53:12.710]
Guess what they have on some syndicated national sports show talking about some other game and some other team you mean Kim Boe never came on never

[01:53:14.370 --> 01:53:19.130]
Why would that be he wasn't a real the game ended like before midnight? I know he never came on

[01:53:19.130 --> 01:53:24.950]
Maybe he wasn't there. Maybe he was maybe he and nickel went out and got blitzed but the thing is they put on the only blitz

[01:53:24.950 --> 01:53:32.910]
The newly wasn't there, huh? They put all the commercials for the hour on in five minutes. Oh yeah

[01:53:33.390 --> 01:53:39.910]
Haven't you heard me say that the last several months now as long as we get the spots in they don't care right in other words

[01:53:39.910 --> 01:53:45.090]
I could take off every day. Oh, they suckered me man. Yeah, I mean, I mean they suckered me big time

[01:53:45.090 --> 01:53:50.370]
Because I thought Kim is gonna be on it. He's gonna tell us that things Kim only Kim can tell it right

[01:53:51.290 --> 01:53:55.910]
If Kim's gotten pretty good lately. Oh, has he really? Yeah, well, I haven't noticed that well

[01:53:55.910 --> 01:53:59.570]
He hasn't been stumbling over his own senses. Well, let's get maybe we can do the news

[01:53:59.570 --> 01:54:02.590]
Horus lately. It's just rolls off his oh in other words

[01:54:02.590 --> 01:54:07.710]
He's doing all kinds of cute little winlicks and cliches and tons for five minutes without answering you

[01:54:09.350 --> 01:54:15.030]
Great, but anyways, how's that now how about Bernie's feet? How big are they they shied 18 or 20?

[01:54:15.290 --> 01:54:17.470]
He trips over him he wasn't getting sacked

[01:54:17.470 --> 01:54:18.910]
He was tripping over his own feet

[01:54:18.910 --> 01:54:24.330]
I do know that Bernie has said to a lot of guys ever see a guy with big feet like this does that tell you what you need to know

[01:54:24.330 --> 01:54:28.130]
You don't want him to say what yeah, yeah, but you know, it's crazy

[01:54:28.130 --> 01:54:32.170]
He just he just what he waddles like a like a chicken and in heat

[01:54:32.170 --> 01:54:36.290]
I mean just the baddest thing he looked like an ugly duck right exactly right

[01:54:36.750 --> 01:54:39.610]
It was ridiculous. I feel sorry. I feel sorry for us

[01:54:39.610 --> 01:54:42.130]
I want Erickson in and I didn't know they couldn't put him in or Jimmy

[01:54:42.130 --> 01:54:44.150]
I would put him in the fourth quarter

[01:54:44.150 --> 01:54:49.290]
I was sitting in even even with all the bad zits I'd have put that kid in there in a heartbeat and said okay

[01:54:49.290 --> 01:54:51.470]
They're gonna be after you like think on stuff quarterback

[01:54:51.470 --> 01:54:56.670]
Erickson is he's had his moments and I know at least he's got some experience and he's not some

[01:54:57.850 --> 01:55:01.870]
He's bad. I think he's better than Bernie didn't do with throwing interception right

[01:55:02.310 --> 01:55:05.290]
Yeah, he did you know they went on a great length

[01:55:05.290 --> 01:55:10.030]
They went on a great length about his great experience when he when he ate the ball at one one of the 85 times

[01:55:10.030 --> 01:55:12.790]
He got sacked, you know, and he didn't just throw it away and get it picked off

[01:55:12.790 --> 01:55:16.710]
He lost two games last year right, you know, I mean give me a break

[01:55:16.710 --> 01:55:18.750]
Yeah, I think he's got the pictures

[01:55:18.750 --> 01:55:22.590]
I think I think Bernie and Gary Stevens have the pictures if he acts me well

[01:55:22.590 --> 01:55:25.430]
I like him, you know, but and what about geared offering Gifer it

[01:55:25.430 --> 01:55:28.510]
They're talking about stupid stuff. I have nothing to do with the game

[01:55:28.510 --> 01:55:31.010]
It was a good game and they're acting like it was a snorer

[01:55:31.010 --> 01:55:35.190]
Yeah, but you got to admit for a guy who's been in bomb six times Gifer don't look too bad. Oh god

[01:55:35.190 --> 01:55:41.630]
They got to get some young blood in there. Yeah exactly. They got to put like John Stewart there or something from MTV

[01:55:41.630 --> 01:55:44.670]
Yeah, that'll do it. Could he do or John Tess?

[01:55:45.710 --> 01:55:49.530]
That'll put you to sleep. Okay pal. Kim. Kim. Kim. Bissens you big kiss

[01:55:49.530 --> 01:55:51.990]
Okay, we have an open line on the blue line five two four

[01:55:51.990 --> 01:55:58.130]
So he's got a Cox broadcasting horse story. How do you like that as we once again lured the audience down the garden path

[01:55:58.130 --> 01:56:01.150]
Just like last Friday when at noon you thought oh he's there today

[01:56:01.150 --> 01:56:05.890]
We're having a show and he's to oh surprise come noon. It's the best of well

[01:56:05.890 --> 01:56:09.730]
Hey, I had to catch a plane. I'm not gonna go losing all that money on airline tickets

[01:56:09.730 --> 01:56:14.010]
That I buy way ahead of time or change all my plans just to get to be here. They don't care

[01:56:14.390 --> 01:56:19.770]
They don't give it them Steve nickel may have returned his head like Linda Blair and spun it around a couple times to impress George

[01:56:19.770 --> 01:56:22.410]
That I'm a pain in the ass, but we don't really care about that either

[01:56:23.770 --> 01:56:26.270]
Because we don't know if he's even gonna be here at this point

[01:56:27.290 --> 01:56:31.110]
He's like doing all the formatics and he's negotiating with this one and negotiating with that one

[01:56:31.110 --> 01:56:35.830]
But in the meantime, I guess a D day has arrived or may arrive or may not arrive. Okay, we don't know

[01:56:36.470 --> 01:56:37.990]
I'm still waiting for phone calls

[01:56:37.990 --> 01:56:42.570]
I just had a phone call with Norm Kent by the way of apologizing for that check bouncing and he said well

[01:56:42.570 --> 01:56:47.170]
Guess what and he started telling me all these horse stories about nations bank that made me feel very good about the fact

[01:56:47.170 --> 01:56:50.970]
I'm gonna be saying goodbye to nations bank as in probably tomorrow and when all those checks clear

[01:56:51.790 --> 01:56:56.350]
I mean just just take a look here. Just take a look at the I mean you can see it from there. Okay, the list

[01:56:56.350 --> 01:57:02.850]
I mean returned returned or they're overdrawn over a fee charge insufficient for and it's all their mistake

[01:57:04.510 --> 01:57:07.690]
And and at least I'll say one thing for them at least it's a new mistake

[01:57:07.690 --> 01:57:12.590]
It's not just another all we put a hold on it when we weren't supposed to it just we we just screwed up

[01:57:12.590 --> 01:57:15.130]
We bounced the check when he had more than enough to cover it

[01:57:15.130 --> 01:57:21.170]
That's the thing these people kept looking at yesterday. We kept looking at the screen over and over again like are we missing something over here?

[01:57:22.390 --> 01:57:28.990]
And even after they took out the $27 bogus fee for bouncing the check there was still more than a hundred dollars more than enough to cover the check

[01:57:28.990 --> 01:57:31.050]
I don't confuse us with the facts. Okay

[01:57:32.870 --> 01:57:33.550]
Smarty pants

[01:57:35.310 --> 01:57:35.710]
I

[01:57:35.710 --> 01:57:38.890]
Think I think it's a time for people to start suing the crap out of the banks

[01:57:38.890 --> 01:57:43.470]
I really lawsuit comes to mind immediately 1222 at WIOD

[01:57:44.130 --> 01:57:46.190]
Use talking entertainment radio

[01:57:46.190 --> 01:57:54.930]
Talk and entertain the radio 610 WIOD I looked up paintings. We apologize. I apologize never do it again

[01:57:54.930 --> 01:57:57.830]
Introducing a whole new kind of tampon from paytech

[01:57:57.830 --> 01:58:03.330]
If you're like me you want a tampon with a cardboard applicator, but it's got to be comfortable

[01:58:03.330 --> 01:58:10.570]
That's why I use new paytech silk-wide tampons with an improved applicator that's even easier to use it just feels better

[01:58:10.570 --> 01:58:15.190]
Oh, I know what you're thinking you're a guy. Why would you need to wear a tampon in the first place?

[01:58:15.630 --> 01:58:19.710]
Well, let's just say you don't want to know and for those heavy flu days

[01:58:19.710 --> 01:58:26.510]
I use paytech silk-wide plus no again. I know what you're thinking you're thinking what flow and once again

[01:58:26.510 --> 01:58:32.770]
You really don't want to know new paytech silk-wide tampons strong enough for a woman but made for a man

[01:58:32.770 --> 01:58:39.390]
Trust us. You don't want to know 1226 at WIOD. We have an open line a day at 7519 463

[01:58:39.930 --> 01:58:43.710]
751 in fact, we got a new banking show on a weekend come up. It's called bounce this

[01:58:44.770 --> 01:58:48.790]
Here's a mobile implantation hello. Neil. Yes, sir. How are you great?

[01:58:49.170 --> 01:58:55.050]
Here's the essence of today every time you rip a part of the society down here or a segment of this or something

[01:58:55.050 --> 01:59:00.570]
People are falling all over themselves to try and call up and defend what you're ripping saying you're wrong

[01:59:00.570 --> 01:59:06.910]
You made a mistake today from the banks nothing not a teller. No one has called to say you're wrong

[01:59:06.910 --> 01:59:09.650]
And how about I'm about four hours yesterday

[01:59:10.370 --> 01:59:14.870]
Absolutely. Yeah, it just goes on and on because it's you don't have enough time in a day

[01:59:14.870 --> 01:59:20.270]
If they look because it's it's indefensible but I was on a phone with norm can't telling him about how they bounced the checker

[01:59:20.270 --> 01:59:26.250]
Wrote him he starts telling me about a guy who canceled is like a multi-millionaire who yanked twenty million dollars out of

[01:59:26.250 --> 01:59:31.770]
Nations bank because he was fed up with their bullcrap. Yeah, he acted all right. He acted. That's right. I seal it. Okay, pal

[01:59:32.730 --> 01:59:33.090]
I

[01:59:33.090 --> 01:59:36.210]
Think norm was the one who yanked. Okay, we have an open line in days seven five one

[01:59:36.210 --> 01:59:40.010]
We got one in Broward five two four nine four six three five two four W I O D

[01:59:40.750 --> 01:59:46.390]
I mean you're putting tons of money. I'm talking about hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars through this

[01:59:46.390 --> 01:59:50.850]
Financial institution every year you might as well be a turd on toast man for all they care

[01:59:50.850 --> 01:59:55.290]
They don't care and they sure put a big act on for you when they know you're gonna go on a radio and slam

[01:59:55.290 --> 01:59:58.350]
I'm again for four more hours the next day which I have and

[01:59:58.350 --> 02:00:01.490]
Deservedly so because when I went home afterward I get this other bunch of crap

[02:00:02.270 --> 02:00:08.630]
You just keep getting these notices and they're very it's like never a never a phone call never somebody saying

[02:00:08.630 --> 02:00:13.970]
Gee, I think we got a problem here. Maybe it's your you slipped up on your math or maybe we slipped up over here

[02:00:13.970 --> 02:00:17.430]
But never no no not just to get the fees in there

[02:00:17.430 --> 02:00:23.330]
Just put the charges on there just do your thing on your computer and just life keeps going on and hope he don't find out and get pissed off

[02:00:25.190 --> 02:00:25.990]
Right Kimberly

[02:00:28.110 --> 02:00:30.070]
Here's Oakland Park on the purple line hello

[02:00:31.790 --> 02:00:39.390]
Neil yes, sir. Yes, sir. I've got one for you. I get a check from first nationwide bank in Amorac, right?

[02:00:39.550 --> 02:00:44.970]
Yeah, and I called the verify fund so I called the bank and it says you have to call a

[02:00:44.970 --> 02:00:47.390]
1900 number to verify fun

[02:00:48.750 --> 02:00:55.090]
And I said a 1900 it says yeah, there's a charge and I said well, thank you very much

[02:00:56.370 --> 02:01:00.810]
You have to call you have wait a minute you have to pay a charge to to verify your balance

[02:01:00.810 --> 02:01:03.650]
No, no, no, no, no, I received a check from

[02:01:04.530 --> 02:01:09.370]
From a customer who has a check of that I see what you say in other words to verify the

[02:01:10.190 --> 02:01:14.910]
Rear of that's on they they tell me I got to call a 1900 number. Yeah

[02:01:15.690 --> 02:01:21.250]
So you're not the customer of the banks that they're gonna rip you off naturally right right so all right

[02:01:21.250 --> 02:01:27.870]
I got another one. I get a check from a customer first union. I go to cash it since I don't have a

[02:01:28.810 --> 02:01:35.410]
And that's just since I don't have an account there. They make me put my fingerprint on the check before I cash it a

[02:01:35.410 --> 02:01:40.790]
Fingerprint a fingerprint like like did they put it did they put a number across your chest and take a photo?

[02:01:41.190 --> 02:01:45.430]
No, no, no, just just just just a fingerprint. Yes, a fingerprint

[02:01:46.290 --> 02:01:52.250]
Unbelievable, okay, and I got my third one. I would have told them to stick their thumb in there. I got a third one

[02:01:52.250 --> 02:01:54.790]
Check card. Yeah, I

[02:01:55.330 --> 02:01:59.030]
Go by a pair a pair sunglasses $150. Yeah

[02:01:59.730 --> 02:02:04.330]
They run the card through it doesn't register so they run it again, right?

[02:02:05.610 --> 02:02:12.090]
Apparently the card went through twice three hundred bucks. So so there's three hundred dollars with the charges right so

[02:02:12.850 --> 02:02:17.490]
Instead of taking $150 out there's 300 so that that makes

[02:02:18.570 --> 02:02:20.250]
4 or 5 of my checks bounce

[02:02:20.730 --> 02:02:27.010]
So I call them up and said listen the charges went through twice and they say listen listen. That's not our fault

[02:02:27.010 --> 02:02:30.850]
So I had about a hundred twenty five dollars worth of

[02:02:31.410 --> 02:02:34.350]
Bounce check charges because my card went through twice

[02:02:35.030 --> 02:02:38.430]
Well, you sound like a perfect candidate cop dial amateurs man get a big one

[02:02:39.510 --> 02:02:40.730]
And a mattress too

[02:02:47.490 --> 02:02:48.950]
I was in front of you

[02:02:49.490 --> 02:02:55.350]
Or if you're young you lose I've got the tamarack blues

[02:02:58.410 --> 02:03:01.610]
All I heard today

[02:03:03.110 --> 02:03:06.270]
Was hey, that's the hell out of my way

[02:03:06.270 --> 02:03:11.750]
I got the tamarack

[02:03:20.330 --> 02:03:21.130]
Oh

[02:03:21.130 --> 02:03:22.170]
Calling number 41

[02:03:22.770 --> 02:03:26.770]
41 over here. What do you mean I'm 41? You're crazy. I got that

[02:03:26.770 --> 02:03:35.810]
My friend

[02:03:36.770 --> 02:03:38.570]
If your life is

[02:03:40.870 --> 02:03:46.510]
Between commercial and West big nap you'll get the tamarack blues

[02:03:50.410 --> 02:03:55.350]
All right, what is it 10 30 somewhere maybe a Nova Scotia 1231 at W. I. D

[02:03:55.350 --> 02:04:00.550]
We have an open line in day 7519 463 751 W. I. Oh

[02:04:00.550 --> 02:04:06.070]
D and one in Broward Chris we probably have some listeners out there who are rather amazed that here

[02:04:06.070 --> 02:04:11.490]
It is like three days before the sale of the radio station goes through and we still haven't put the pieces of the puzzle together

[02:04:11.490 --> 02:04:15.090]
We still don't know who's on first. We know Ron and Ron start Monday morning

[02:04:15.090 --> 02:04:20.450]
Okay, I noticed that Rick's been doing everything in his power to denigrate them and to make sure that they he can help them fail

[02:04:20.850 --> 02:04:22.350]
See it's always gonna be that way

[02:04:22.350 --> 02:04:24.290]
It's always gonna be that kind of ego thing in other words

[02:04:24.290 --> 02:04:28.330]
If you go in the morning and you're flopped and then you go back to the afternoon and have a chance to succeed again

[02:04:28.330 --> 02:04:33.190]
That isn't sufficient. It's very important that they do a real bad number in the morning to make you feel better, right Rick?

[02:04:33.790 --> 02:04:42.650]
Okay, we have an open line of Broward 5249 463 524 here's a lady in Miami. Hello. Hi, Neil. Yes, ma'am. I have a horror story to tell you a horror story

[02:04:45.050 --> 02:04:49.170]
Okay, friend of mine got a thousand dollars on these savings alone

[02:04:50.350 --> 02:04:57.250]
And in the in the man the handkerchief he asked for specifically for a hundred dollar bills because she was going up to the Indians to play the machine

[02:04:57.250 --> 02:05:02.870]
So they gave her ten one hundred dollar bills and one of their little envelopes and gave it back to her

[02:05:02.870 --> 02:05:06.570]
So she puts the envelope in her purse goes to the machines when she gets there

[02:05:06.570 --> 02:05:11.030]
They have people walk around to make change because she has a guy a hundred dollar bill counterfeit

[02:05:11.030 --> 02:05:13.050]
Yeah, but you don't know what happened

[02:05:14.030 --> 02:05:18.910]
He takes the bill gives her the change comes back ten minutes later and says come with me

[02:05:19.670 --> 02:05:22.730]
She says what's the problem? He says will the bill you gave you is no good?

[02:05:22.730 --> 02:05:27.410]
She says well here she says I just got them from the bank just give me back that bill and I'll give you another one

[02:05:27.850 --> 02:05:33.850]
She gives him another one. It's counterfeit. Hmm. They take her in a room now at the seminal Indians

[02:05:33.850 --> 02:05:36.430]
It's freezing in there. It's a crap bottle right?

[02:05:36.430 --> 02:05:40.090]
They gave her a meat locker a meat the crap bottle yeah, wait a minute

[02:05:40.090 --> 02:05:44.330]
They're interrogating her as a manager the casinos in there and the securities in there

[02:05:44.330 --> 02:05:47.030]
Five minutes later who shows up five

[02:05:48.110 --> 02:05:48.910]
Secret service

[02:05:50.130 --> 02:05:56.690]
Oh, this is unbelievable. I mean this is just a normal lady, you know, this is not just a normal counterfeiting lady

[02:05:56.690 --> 02:05:59.430]
No, so they said to her can we search your purse?

[02:05:59.570 --> 02:06:03.270]
She said of course that they go to her purse. They said can we look can we search your car?

[02:06:03.270 --> 02:06:06.870]
She said absolutely you're gonna find a printing press under the front seat

[02:06:06.870 --> 02:06:13.610]
They searched your car. They didn't find anything they searched her purse. They kept her there for five hours nice

[02:06:14.410 --> 02:06:15.930]
freezing cold room

[02:06:15.930 --> 02:06:21.850]
She had to go get an attorney the next day and I don't know what the outcome is because everything is kind of in limbo right now

[02:06:21.850 --> 02:06:23.950]
But they confiscated three

[02:06:24.610 --> 02:06:26.790]
$100 bills from her that were counterfeit

[02:06:26.790 --> 02:06:31.830]
She went back to the bank the next day and explained to them that they gave her $100 bills

[02:06:31.830 --> 02:06:36.710]
She showed them the envelope everything. It's a will you could have switched the bills after you left the window

[02:06:40.410 --> 02:06:45.570]
Right, so in other words, they're saying that they didn't give her the now what bank was this it was

[02:06:47.870 --> 02:06:54.010]
It's a savings and loan savings of America. Oh

[02:06:54.010 --> 02:06:57.890]
From what I've heard the last two days it sounds like our banking institutions out for it

[02:06:57.890 --> 02:07:02.870]
I had to got lots and lots of counterfeit. So anyway, I went to the bank today lots and lots of counterfeit

[02:07:02.870 --> 02:07:06.530]
I cast a $200 check today and I asked for 50s and 20s

[02:07:06.530 --> 02:07:11.850]
I said to the girl before she gave me the envelope. I said do you check your bills before you hand them out

[02:07:11.850 --> 02:07:15.370]
She says what do you mean? I said I want to be sure you're not giving me counterfeit bills

[02:07:15.370 --> 02:07:19.530]
She got very annoyed really. Yes. She got a real annoyed. I said look later

[02:07:19.530 --> 02:07:25.290]
Well excuse me from you don't you have the pen that checks something. She says no, we don't do that here

[02:07:25.810 --> 02:07:27.370]
That was it Barnett

[02:07:27.370 --> 02:07:32.850]
Like I said I didn't get hundreds because I didn't want to be stuck with a hundred cow

[02:07:32.850 --> 02:07:36.710]
I thought the new hundreds couldn't be counterfeited, but I don't know it's it's crazy

[02:07:36.710 --> 02:07:43.170]
I think I think your next project is to write a book and I want you to document all these horror stories from the bank

[02:07:43.170 --> 02:07:48.990]
We could write an encyclopedia. I'm serious. Okay. Okay. I'll see you thing. Oh, bye. Bye. Bye

[02:07:49.530 --> 02:07:54.510]
Yeah, pawn off those counterfeits to the Indians. Okay, I'll get even with all those cancer sticks. They're peddling to the white man

[02:07:54.510 --> 02:08:00.930]
We have an open line in date seven five one nine four six three one and Broward five two four. How six pack doing?

[02:08:01.350 --> 02:08:03.490]
It's 1235 at W I O D

[02:08:03.490 --> 02:08:10.150]
To protect your amateur status. You'll get no pay for appearing on Neil won't like it the I O D amateur hour

[02:08:10.150 --> 02:08:13.990]
Cinder tapes impress yourself and humiliate your family

[02:08:14.470 --> 02:08:19.010]
Neil won't like it Sunday night at 11 on news talk and entertainment radio

[02:08:19.530 --> 02:08:22.490]
610 W I O D

[02:08:23.190 --> 02:08:25.530]
News talk and entertainment radio

[02:08:26.210 --> 02:08:30.950]
610 W I O D we had that on KAT 20 years ago

[02:08:31.530 --> 02:08:37.030]
20 years you remember that? Oh sure you do catch the cat and it had the big

[02:08:37.570 --> 02:08:39.610]
Silhouette of the cat with a CBS I

[02:08:40.210 --> 02:08:46.390]
20 years ago we had bus signs for KAT on a station that was like all dead people and we still had promotion

[02:08:46.390 --> 02:08:52.810]
How do you like that? But hey, we don't want to get started with that now because we got three more days three more days three more days

[02:08:53.670 --> 02:08:58.310]
We have two more open lines in day seven five one nine four six three seven five one one thing

[02:08:58.310 --> 02:09:03.510]
I'll say for the Cox broadcasting people boy they're consistent. They don't care about anybody

[02:09:03.510 --> 02:09:08.970]
I mean about anybody human considerations do not cross their mind whatsoever

[02:09:08.970 --> 02:09:13.490]
So if Larry Podwell is listening if you're still like a pissed off, okay?

[02:09:13.490 --> 02:09:18.010]
Because you told him you were buying a house and they said hey good luck go buy a house and in like two days later

[02:09:18.010 --> 02:09:20.030]
They can you ask it thank a Christmas time

[02:09:20.910 --> 02:09:27.050]
Trust me when I tell you it's not a question of if it's a question of when you're gonna get it right up the old

[02:09:27.050 --> 02:09:29.710]
Brackham from Cox broadcast because they just don't care

[02:09:30.730 --> 02:09:35.570]
It's like back when people were practically falling like flies in this building which we remember like it was yesterday

[02:09:36.510 --> 02:09:42.150]
When there was this corporate mong and disease in this room and in most rooms in this building because the air conditioning

[02:09:42.150 --> 02:09:44.450]
Vance hadn't been cleaned out in 20 or 30 years

[02:09:45.170 --> 02:09:48.850]
Well, I it's it's not economic not economically feasible at this time

[02:09:49.610 --> 02:09:53.230]
In other words, it's not economically feasible for them to worry about whether the

[02:09:53.710 --> 02:10:00.690]
Sanitation in this building is enough to sustain human life. That's basically what we were told in one of the most incredibly

[02:10:00.690 --> 02:10:02.990]
Unbelievable lines in the history of the human race

[02:10:03.770 --> 02:10:10.310]
It's not economically feasible at this time in other words don't bother us and then our friend Barry Cohen came in here

[02:10:10.310 --> 02:10:16.170]
It's still got those pictures by the way remember the pictures with the mountain it looks seriously look like mountains of mong

[02:10:16.990 --> 02:10:24.190]
That they sucked out of the events in this building hadn't been removed in the in centuries talk about a sick building talk about a sick puppy

[02:10:25.850 --> 02:10:31.010]
But it fits right in with that hey, it's only people we can't we're not worried about your health because we don't give a crap if you dropped

[02:10:31.010 --> 02:10:31.570]
That or not

[02:10:32.190 --> 02:10:36.930]
Once we have squeezed every every ounce of energy out of your body screw off. We're busy with other stuff

[02:10:36.930 --> 02:10:38.910]
We got that big thing in Syracuse going now

[02:10:40.310 --> 02:10:43.130]
And so anyway never we never even got into this this morning

[02:10:43.130 --> 02:10:48.010]
So I get the news from Rick and suds wait till you hear this wait till you hear this hold on tight

[02:10:49.810 --> 02:10:52.990]
WS UN in Tampa another Cox station and

[02:10:53.730 --> 02:10:58.570]
The sports station that they were simile casting within the same market whatever the call it is our

[02:11:00.390 --> 02:11:03.530]
WS UN is now simile casting the

[02:11:04.670 --> 02:11:08.050]
What is the what what not the coast? What's the other FMA God?

[02:11:08.790 --> 02:11:14.650]
Whatever it was their simile casting the FM and the sports station is now simile casting the coast

[02:11:16.730 --> 02:11:21.890]
Music on a M that's that's the ultimate desperation in Tampa with WS UN

[02:11:21.890 --> 02:11:27.490]
That's Cox broadcasting for you because you know that guy from the F.A. He said David Katen said this and he said that

[02:11:27.490 --> 02:11:30.190]
Okay, we'll take all our programs off the air place of music

[02:11:32.090 --> 02:11:35.770]
Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello. Oh, Niel. Yes, sir. How you doing great?

[02:11:36.330 --> 02:11:38.850]

Why don't you open the calendar smaller bank? I'm going to tomorrow because you know I got a Mickey Mouse business and

Officer that's it. I'll fix you right up. Right. Okay, man. I'm doing it and one more thing

[02:12:04.210 --> 02:12:07.710]
Yes, sir. Have you ever tried to take back a counterfeit that bang gave you?

[02:12:08.310 --> 02:12:12.010]
No, but I just they look at they look at you like you're crazy exactly like you do

[02:12:12.010 --> 02:12:18.110]
No way in hell they're gonna give up that that dollar and you know something they're probably printing it on the inside. Oh, yeah

[02:12:18.110 --> 02:12:19.690]
Okay, pal, thank you. They're luck to us

[02:12:20.530 --> 02:12:23.990]
Yes, matter of fact every now and then you do see them a dart into those little rooms

[02:12:23.990 --> 02:12:30.310]
Especially in that area where the drive-through is you know behind the counters where the tellers hang out and there those rooms off to the side

[02:12:30.310 --> 02:12:32.410]
I wouldn't be surprised if that's where the printing presses are

[02:12:33.170 --> 02:12:36.230]
There's probably like 20s 50s and hundreds going in there like a mile a minute

[02:12:36.230 --> 02:12:39.770]
Oh, excuse me a second. We just ran out of paper and you know, I mean how to ink. I mean

[02:12:41.630 --> 02:12:42.950]
Here's a sweetwater. Hello

[02:12:45.050 --> 02:12:45.450]
Sweetwater

[02:12:46.250 --> 02:12:56.250]
Going once going twice. I'll read the urge. Okay, probably some speak two open lines in day 7519 463751 WYOD. Here's Palm Beach. Hello

[02:13:02.590 --> 02:13:06.670]
I got a sports question for you. You're the only guy in town that knows I don't think so

[02:13:08.310 --> 02:13:13.390]
Yeah, okay, say the dolphins are under 20 yard line. Yeah, it's second-towel. That means they're not gonna score

[02:13:13.390 --> 02:13:18.970]
Right, maybe a fuel goal, but he'll probably miss it. Yeah, yeah, well, this is what this is about. Okay, they bring in that

[02:13:18.970 --> 02:13:26.430]
What's his name? Nuddy? Okay, he could his name is Joe Nudnic. Whatever is name. Nudnic. Yeah. Okay, he kicks it into the audience

[02:13:26.890 --> 02:13:27.870]
Into the audience

[02:13:29.470 --> 02:13:34.130]
Into the crowd. Yeah, wow, if I was second down does he get the kick it again? Of course not

[02:13:34.790 --> 02:13:39.550]
Why? Well, what do you mean why would you just give up the ball the ball is in a crowd. That's that's it

[02:13:40.130 --> 02:13:45.690]
You're sure? On second down. Yeah, you're gonna think kick it on third, huh?

[02:13:46.750 --> 02:13:52.250]
You get the kick it again. I'm third down. On third down. It's only third down. No way

[02:13:53.050 --> 02:13:56.750]
Not on second down. There's pride hours out there when the heart got one wrong

[02:13:56.750 --> 02:14:02.010]
I've never heard that before. I never even thought about that on second down because first of all unless it was right at the end of the game

[02:14:02.830 --> 02:14:06.790]
Now, how would you do that anyway? Just hype it. Tetic way. I mean you get the kick it again

[02:14:06.790 --> 02:14:09.630]
You do you miss it on third down you get to kick it on fourth down

[02:14:11.370 --> 02:14:14.950]
If you miss it on third down you get to kick it on fourth down since when

[02:14:15.750 --> 02:14:17.350]
When even if you don't kick it

[02:14:17.350 --> 02:14:21.110]
If the ball doesn't land in the playing field it just goes into the crowd

[02:14:21.110 --> 02:14:27.150]
It does you know you just know good you're like that guy on my any to keep kicking it right right. Yeah, you get the ball back

[02:14:27.830 --> 02:14:33.290]
You get to kick it again. I don't think so or you've got to find out we'll find out for you

[02:14:33.290 --> 02:14:39.330]
Okay, from somebody I've never even thought about it. Okay. Do we have time for one more question here? If it's as good as that one

[02:14:39.330 --> 02:14:40.070]
No chance

[02:14:40.630 --> 02:14:45.950]
Okay, we have two open lines on the green lines one eight hundred nine four four nine four six three one eight hundred nine four four four

[02:14:45.950 --> 02:14:47.910]
W-I-O-D here's

[02:14:48.490 --> 02:14:49.430]
Plantation hello

[02:14:50.490 --> 02:14:52.250]
Hello, yes, ma'am hi, Neil

[02:14:52.830 --> 02:15:00.270]
Um, I just want to tell you I've had some dealings with the same bank that you're branch. You're talking about the same person

[02:15:00.270 --> 02:15:07.450]
Yeah, and it's awful. You know, I mean you know, I mean Haitians bank do yeah. Yeah, we've Kimberly a disaster a

[02:15:07.450 --> 02:15:13.630]
Disaster a mitigated disaster. This is a government account. This is it's awful and we have changed

[02:15:13.630 --> 02:15:16.230]
We have changed, but personally

[02:15:17.690 --> 02:15:25.110]
I go I deal with family bank in Weston and Ed and Maude over there. I mean they really do treat you as

[02:15:25.910 --> 02:15:29.930]
It's great. I'm sure the Sunrise will do the same thing. Oh, yeah, they will believe me

[02:15:29.930 --> 02:15:33.470]
Matt will treat me like a member of the family or else, okay

[02:15:33.470 --> 02:15:37.930]
You heard really everybody said we got it on the tape. He said whatever you want. It's free

[02:15:37.930 --> 02:15:43.510]
That's right. Three money free checking free booze free whatever you want. Yeah, but you'll love them

[02:15:44.830 --> 02:15:51.050]
I hope you're right. Oh, you will. There's this other not a number there. You really treat you as a part. You know something

[02:15:51.050 --> 02:15:55.970]
You know what bothers me is that I'm not a number anymore at the other place either they all know me

[02:15:55.970 --> 02:16:01.110]
And they still and they still can't get it right and they still won't even give me the courtesy of calling and saying oops

[02:16:01.110 --> 02:16:02.430]
There's a problem here. Yeah

[02:16:03.370 --> 02:16:07.470]
Because they got so many fingers in the pot over there. It's like Cox broadcasting. They got so many

[02:16:07.910 --> 02:16:11.970]
Straw bosses running around here. Nobody know has any answers because everybody's got a title

[02:16:11.970 --> 02:16:19.690]
Yeah, you're right, but Ed and Maude they'll call Ed and Maude and Matt. Yep. Okay, sweetheart. All right. Thanks. Okay, family bank

[02:16:19.690 --> 02:16:22.050]
Let's give them a big boost and then after they screw up then we'll rip them

[02:16:22.390 --> 02:16:25.650]
We have an open line of pride. Not seriously. I mean, you know, they're going out on the limb

[02:16:25.650 --> 02:16:28.990]
They probably can survive without my business, but the fact is they're, uh, you know

[02:16:28.990 --> 02:16:31.030]
They're gonna do a good job. They're gonna bend over backward

[02:16:31.030 --> 02:16:34.610]
Which is more than I can say for the other place because they're too busy taking off for young kipper

[02:16:35.930 --> 02:16:40.630]
Oh brother. I mean just uh, oh here's another list of some more charges by the way. Here's a fee

[02:16:40.630 --> 02:16:42.010]
There's a fee. There's another one over here

[02:16:42.950 --> 02:16:46.910]
You know, it's it's a miracle anybody's got any cash left and a their accounts after all the bogus fees

[02:16:46.910 --> 02:16:51.090]
They keep deducting in there just keep yanking it out. Okay, the money's in there. Just keep dittling with it

[02:16:53.090 --> 02:16:55.510]
1247 and W.I.O.D. if you're tied and dittling with it

[02:16:55.510 --> 02:16:58.810]
If you want to put something really spectacular and satisfying in your push

[02:16:59.290 --> 02:17:01.190]
Then Mike cigars is where you'll find it

[02:17:01.190 --> 02:17:05.730]

They got part of this. They got their own house brand La Sensiatos

If you love a great cigar and even more women now are puffing on a big one on a cigar too

[02:17:32.790 --> 02:17:38.730]
That's right. It's become the in thing everybody is a puffing on it because first of all doesn't kill you as fans and cigarettes

[02:17:39.370 --> 02:17:43.270]
When we say dolphins on radio we mean Simfer and Mad Dog

[02:17:43.270 --> 02:17:44.510]
He's in front of that

[02:17:44.510 --> 02:17:47.430]
I just saw him by the dolphins arrive

[02:17:47.430 --> 02:17:48.850]
Turn down the TV center

[02:17:48.850 --> 02:17:49.470]
You check that

[02:17:49.470 --> 02:17:50.230]
Check out the dolphins

[02:17:50.230 --> 02:17:53.770]
On the only radio station you remember when the dolphins play

[02:17:54.330 --> 02:17:56.250]
News talking entertainment radio

[02:17:56.250 --> 02:17:57.430]

Guess what honey? I've got a big surprise for you

[02:18:12.370 --> 02:18:13.670]
Really? What is it?

[02:18:13.810 --> 02:18:15.110]
A new car? No

[02:18:15.110 --> 02:18:16.030]
A birthday present

[02:18:16.030 --> 02:18:16.370]
No

[02:18:16.370 --> 02:18:17.630]
Then what is it?

[02:18:17.710 --> 02:18:19.330]
I have syphilis

[02:18:22.310 --> 02:18:23.710]
God pen is still in

[02:18:23.710 --> 02:18:26.410]
Brought to you by the National Venerable Disease Board in this radio station

[02:18:26.410 --> 02:18:28.310]
Okay, 1250 at W-I-O-D

[02:18:28.310 --> 02:18:30.750]
We have a mobile in highly waiting. Hello

[02:18:31.730 --> 02:18:32.410]
Yes sir

[02:18:32.410 --> 02:18:35.730]
How you doing? I have a Haitian Spank Horror story

[02:18:35.730 --> 02:18:36.110]
Okay

[02:18:36.110 --> 02:18:37.230]
Can I share it with you?

[02:18:37.230 --> 02:18:37.570]
Yeah, I'm on

[02:18:37.570 --> 02:18:38.250]
Okay

[02:18:38.910 --> 02:18:41.910]
First of all you cannot get a regular checking account

[02:18:42.750 --> 02:18:44.490]
If you have bad credit

[02:18:44.490 --> 02:18:45.570]
Did you know that?

[02:18:46.730 --> 02:18:49.990]
You can't get a regular checking account if you have bad credit

[02:18:50.530 --> 02:18:52.170]
Right what does that mean? What what what what what?

[02:18:52.370 --> 02:18:54.110]
Here's the story I got my end

[02:18:54.110 --> 02:18:55.870]
So open up and accounts

[02:18:55.870 --> 02:18:56.410]
Yeah

[02:18:56.410 --> 02:18:58.690]
I give them my paycheck to open the accounts

[02:18:58.690 --> 02:19:01.270]
It deposits you know to open the checking account

[02:19:01.830 --> 02:19:02.310]
Okay

[02:19:02.790 --> 02:19:04.350]
Three or four days later

[02:19:04.350 --> 02:19:07.430]
I get a letter from the president of Haitian's bank

[02:19:07.430 --> 02:19:09.990]
That we were good to inform you

[02:19:09.990 --> 02:19:12.450]
We can we have to decline your

[02:19:13.070 --> 02:19:16.870]
Your application for a regular checking account due to your credit history

[02:19:16.870 --> 02:19:17.210]
Yeah

[02:19:17.210 --> 02:19:20.670]
This is after I spent two hours in the bank

[02:19:20.670 --> 02:19:23.450]
Just trying to open up the spanking checking account

[02:19:23.450 --> 02:19:26.050]
You know they wouldn't they didn't tell me that while sitting there

[02:19:26.050 --> 02:19:28.050]
Filling out and giving them all the information

[02:19:28.050 --> 02:19:28.810]
So what happened?

[02:19:29.030 --> 02:19:31.890]
So they I I go back to the bank

[02:19:31.890 --> 02:19:35.170]
I demand my money they say I can't be in my house to wait until to check clear

[02:19:37.130 --> 02:19:38.670]
Because you were dead meat right?

[02:19:39.370 --> 02:19:39.910]
Exactly right

[02:19:39.910 --> 02:19:41.970]
It's not a prior few problems a few years ago

[02:19:41.970 --> 02:19:42.930]
But anyway

[02:19:42.930 --> 02:19:46.350]
You know I had to raise help just to get my money

[02:19:46.350 --> 02:19:48.330]
That they they weren't going to let me keep in their bank

[02:19:48.330 --> 02:19:48.770]
Yeah

[02:19:48.770 --> 02:19:50.870]
And that's the end of that story

[02:19:50.870 --> 02:19:53.790]
I wrote them an out to you letter and thank God for Haitian's bank

[02:19:53.790 --> 02:19:54.650]
Yeah amen

[02:19:54.650 --> 02:19:55.170]
Amen

[02:19:55.170 --> 02:19:55.930]
Okay, thank you

[02:19:55.930 --> 02:19:57.770]
Just say goodbye just don't do it

[02:19:57.770 --> 02:20:00.010]
If you're thinking about opening up an account there just don't do it

[02:20:00.010 --> 02:20:02.310]
That's my best advice based on personal grief

[02:20:02.310 --> 02:20:03.850]
And so is like you wouldn't believe

[02:20:03.850 --> 02:20:06.250]
And how come I did have all those stupid checks made up

[02:20:06.250 --> 02:20:09.390]
Well see the first thing is I made up a bunch of checks for my old printer

[02:20:09.390 --> 02:20:10.910]
So I've got like 2000 of those

[02:20:10.910 --> 02:20:14.110]
And then all of a sudden I decided well you know this laser printer is really

[02:20:14.110 --> 02:20:14.710]
Hello a lot better

[02:20:14.710 --> 02:20:15.730]
I'm going to put that on there

[02:20:15.730 --> 02:20:16.830]
And it is a lot better

[02:20:16.830 --> 02:20:18.310]
And I like the way it looks better and all that other

[02:20:18.310 --> 02:20:19.950]
So I got 2000 more of those checks

[02:20:19.950 --> 02:20:22.870]
So I got 4000 checks sitting there on Haitian's bank

[02:20:22.870 --> 02:20:26.410]
For my laser printer that are going to be worthless now

[02:20:28.730 --> 02:20:33.450]
So I'm sure that Matt will you know provide with no problem at all 4000 checks

[02:20:34.330 --> 02:20:34.810]
Exactly

[02:20:35.450 --> 02:20:37.190]
And probably a hundred dollars in cash

[02:20:37.190 --> 02:20:38.850]
And a couple of good cigars

[02:20:39.650 --> 02:20:40.770]
Here's the mobile in Miami

[02:20:40.770 --> 02:20:41.730]
Hello

[02:20:42.270 --> 02:20:42.750]
Hello

[02:20:42.750 --> 02:20:43.350]
Yes sir

[02:20:44.090 --> 02:20:44.290]
Yeah

[02:20:44.290 --> 02:20:47.910]
How many about the question about if you kick it on the second down

[02:20:47.910 --> 02:20:48.210]
Right

[02:20:48.210 --> 02:20:49.550]
You get to kick it again

[02:20:50.690 --> 02:20:52.490]
Number one it's a dumb question

[02:20:52.490 --> 02:20:53.710]
And number two

[02:20:53.710 --> 02:20:57.350]
Once you kick the ball or you're like to kick the ball for unknown reasons

[02:20:57.350 --> 02:20:58.630]
You give up possession

[02:20:58.630 --> 02:21:00.090]
That's what I told a guy

[02:21:00.930 --> 02:21:02.010]
It doesn't make sense

[02:21:02.010 --> 02:21:05.110]
You would only do it if you got a few seconds left in the middle of the clock

[02:21:05.110 --> 02:21:08.930]
And you know you get the ball say wherever you want to play it

[02:21:08.930 --> 02:21:10.570]
And it's second down then you would go to

[02:21:10.570 --> 02:21:12.890]
You know you just don't have enough time to kick it again

[02:21:13.410 --> 02:21:14.410]
That would be the only problem

[02:21:14.410 --> 02:21:15.610]
Unless there was a penalty

[02:21:15.610 --> 02:21:17.070]
Was the only way you get to kick it again

[02:21:17.450 --> 02:21:17.810]
Yeah

[02:21:17.810 --> 02:21:18.470]
There's a penalty

[02:21:18.470 --> 02:21:19.270]
I want to kick the ball

[02:21:19.270 --> 02:21:20.010]
That's it

[02:21:20.010 --> 02:21:20.450]
Right

[02:21:20.450 --> 02:21:22.650]
That's what I mean it seems very basic

[02:21:22.650 --> 02:21:25.850]
And then the guy kept insisting and that's why I got like a dumbfounded

[02:21:25.850 --> 02:21:28.990]
Because once you kick the ball away you don't have possession of it anymore

[02:21:28.990 --> 02:21:30.910]
What differences to make if it goes into crowd

[02:21:30.910 --> 02:21:33.570]
In the back of the end zone up Uranus or whatever

[02:21:33.570 --> 02:21:35.170]
It's not your ball anymore

[02:21:35.170 --> 02:21:36.330]
I mean it doesn't matter

[02:21:36.330 --> 02:21:39.230]
Even if you attempt it and slips and falls on as the can

[02:21:39.230 --> 02:21:40.790]
And that's it

[02:21:40.790 --> 02:21:42.130]
I mean you change possession

[02:21:42.650 --> 02:21:44.210]
Once you elect to do it that's it

[02:21:44.210 --> 02:21:44.790]
Okay

[02:21:44.790 --> 02:21:46.430]
It's a do or die if it's the way

[02:21:46.430 --> 02:21:47.250]
So the guy lost five bucks

[02:21:47.250 --> 02:21:47.710]
All right

[02:21:48.290 --> 02:21:49.450]
That's the best part of the news

[02:21:49.450 --> 02:21:50.230]
That's right

[02:22:05.270 --> 02:22:05.670]
All right

[02:22:05.670 --> 02:22:06.730]
Have a good time with it

[02:22:06.730 --> 02:22:07.090]
Hey listen

[02:22:12.470 --> 02:22:13.970]
Two open lines one day

[02:22:13.970 --> 02:22:15.670]
One in Broward and one on the green line

[02:22:15.670 --> 02:22:18.010]
524-9463 and Broward

[02:22:18.010 --> 02:22:20.130]
524-WYOD

[02:22:20.130 --> 02:22:21.630]
Here's four Lauderdale on the purple line

[02:22:21.630 --> 02:22:21.910]
Hello

[02:22:21.910 --> 02:22:22.590]
Hello

[02:22:22.590 --> 02:22:23.130]
Yes sir

[02:22:23.130 --> 02:22:23.710]
How are you doing

[02:22:23.710 --> 02:22:24.130]
Great

[02:22:24.770 --> 02:22:27.190]
Um family bank would have been my second choice

[02:22:27.190 --> 02:22:27.650]
Okay

[02:22:27.650 --> 02:22:29.610]
My first choice is equitable bank

[02:22:29.610 --> 02:22:30.930]
They're a small little bank

[02:22:30.930 --> 02:22:32.770]
They have I think they'll have three branches

[02:22:32.770 --> 02:22:33.290]
Yeah

[02:22:33.290 --> 02:22:34.950]
One in North Miami Beach

[02:22:34.950 --> 02:22:35.790]
I'm one in uh

[02:22:35.790 --> 02:22:37.690]
University in Broward

[02:22:37.690 --> 02:22:38.810]
I don't know if that's too far

[02:22:39.410 --> 02:22:39.950]
East for you

[02:22:39.950 --> 02:22:42.190]
University in Broward that's not the two beds

[02:22:42.190 --> 02:22:43.130]
Right on the corner there

[02:22:43.130 --> 02:22:43.850]
Yeah I know where it is

[02:22:43.850 --> 02:22:45.350]
And they're just I mean

[02:22:46.270 --> 02:22:47.670]
I'm a small contractor

[02:22:47.670 --> 02:22:49.010]
I mean they know my name

[02:22:49.010 --> 02:22:50.110]
You got a problem

[02:22:50.110 --> 02:22:51.590]
Hey you got to come in and cover that check

[02:22:51.590 --> 02:22:52.590]
By one o'clock you know

[02:22:52.590 --> 02:22:54.590]
No bounce checks none of that crap

[02:22:54.590 --> 02:22:57.650]
And I mean I've been with them five six years

[02:22:57.650 --> 02:22:58.290]
I would never

[02:22:58.730 --> 02:23:00.050]
Never go with a big bank

[02:23:00.050 --> 02:23:00.530]
Yeah

[02:23:00.530 --> 02:23:02.870]
No listen if they're treating you well while we're working

[02:23:02.870 --> 02:23:03.850]
Getting worse than that is the

[02:23:04.630 --> 02:23:06.370]
Most of the banks are not even four today

[02:23:06.370 --> 02:23:07.370]
So all the money

[02:23:07.890 --> 02:23:10.270]
You know it's going to support from out of town back

[02:23:10.270 --> 02:23:10.830]
Right

[02:23:11.890 --> 02:23:12.510]
Okay pal

[02:23:12.510 --> 02:23:13.310]
That's my two cents

[02:23:13.310 --> 02:23:14.010]
Thanks a lot

[02:23:14.010 --> 02:23:14.510]
See ya

[02:23:14.990 --> 02:23:16.330]
Open line on the purple line

[02:23:16.330 --> 02:23:18.890]
And pound iod so anyway to make a long story short

[02:23:18.890 --> 02:23:20.230]
When they get too big for their bridges

[02:23:20.230 --> 02:23:22.190]
All I'll be honest with even before they got this big

[02:23:22.190 --> 02:23:23.250]
They still stuck the joint on

[02:23:23.250 --> 02:23:24.870]
They still kept making the same stupid mistakes

[02:23:24.870 --> 02:23:27.230]
And they still kept changing the tellers every five minutes

[02:23:29.510 --> 02:23:31.310]
And again I'm not saying that it's

[02:23:31.310 --> 02:23:32.810]
Have there some good people in there

[02:23:32.810 --> 02:23:33.890]
There are people who mean well

[02:23:33.890 --> 02:23:34.770]
There's some nice people

[02:23:34.770 --> 02:23:36.070]
And then there's some stupid people

[02:23:36.070 --> 02:23:37.650]
And there's some incompetent people

[02:23:37.650 --> 02:23:38.850]
But it's just uh

[02:23:38.850 --> 02:23:40.250]
You when you're dealing with your money

[02:23:40.250 --> 02:23:41.550]
You're just not going to take pot luck

[02:23:41.550 --> 02:23:42.930]
And a bunch of stories like

[02:23:42.930 --> 02:23:43.290]
Oh yeah

[02:23:43.290 --> 02:23:44.130]
Give us another chance

[02:23:44.130 --> 02:23:46.750]
You've had more chances than Carter's got pills okay

[02:23:48.130 --> 02:23:50.250]
And I was as stupid as I am in lazy

[02:23:50.250 --> 02:23:51.710]
Again there's that word lazy

[02:23:51.710 --> 02:23:53.730]
But having had all those other checks made up

[02:23:53.730 --> 02:23:54.850]
I thought to myself well

[02:23:54.850 --> 02:23:57.470]
I'm stuck now anyway for for quite a while

[02:23:57.470 --> 02:23:58.670]
With all those thousands of checks

[02:23:59.250 --> 02:24:01.290]
And now that I'm eventually going to get paid by Paxton

[02:24:01.290 --> 02:24:02.610]
Sooner or later somehow some way

[02:24:02.610 --> 02:24:05.110]
Maybe that uh we're just making this transition

[02:24:05.110 --> 02:24:07.250]
Would not be the best time to be changing banks anyway

[02:24:07.250 --> 02:24:09.070]
Actually it would be the best time

[02:24:09.070 --> 02:24:10.610]
This would be a good time to do it

[02:24:10.610 --> 02:24:12.130]
When you come right down to it

[02:24:14.330 --> 02:24:16.550]
And then of course maybe there'll be something about direct deposit

[02:24:16.550 --> 02:24:18.690]
I'm gonna say I don't want no direct deposit okay

[02:24:18.690 --> 02:24:20.350]
I don't want direct deposit

[02:24:20.350 --> 02:24:23.870]
I want my check in my hand

[02:24:23.870 --> 02:24:25.090]
I want to look at it

[02:24:25.090 --> 02:24:25.970]
I want to see it

[02:24:25.970 --> 02:24:28.450]
I want to have tangible evidence of how much it is

[02:24:28.450 --> 02:24:30.330]
I want to take it and put it in there myself

[02:24:30.330 --> 02:24:31.750]
I want to stick it right in there

[02:24:32.290 --> 02:24:33.710]
I want to receipt for it

[02:24:33.710 --> 02:24:35.070]
I want to be able to write out uh

[02:24:35.070 --> 02:24:36.470]
To do my stuff

[02:24:37.310 --> 02:24:39.830]
As opposed to letting other people do your stuff for you

[02:24:40.930 --> 02:24:42.550]
Here's a mobile in Palm Beach hello

[02:24:42.550 --> 02:24:45.590]
All right, let me say you straight on the can you kick it again?

[02:24:45.710 --> 02:24:47.890]
Question yeah the guy loses the five bucks

[02:24:47.890 --> 02:24:49.930]
But here's a story once you kick it

[02:24:49.930 --> 02:24:53.050]
You can't you can't re-kick it but you can attempt to kick

[02:24:53.830 --> 02:24:57.110]
And and uh not kick it and and redo it for example

[02:24:57.110 --> 02:24:58.910]
Let's say it's the end of let's say you're in overtime

[02:24:58.910 --> 02:25:00.670]
And you're gonna win with a field goal

[02:25:01.050 --> 02:25:03.390]
And you're down on the 10 yard line and third down

[02:25:03.390 --> 02:25:05.790]
You can do a fake you line up for a field goal

[02:25:05.790 --> 02:25:06.090]
Yeah

[02:25:06.570 --> 02:25:09.150]
I'm third down because if for some reason

[02:25:09.150 --> 02:25:14.290]
The guy must the snap and it goes over the guy's head and then they they just have to fall on it

[02:25:14.290 --> 02:25:17.690]
It's still their ball fourth down and how they can attempt to field goal again

[02:25:17.690 --> 02:25:21.850]
So if you haven't kicked it yet you can you can re-kick it

[02:25:21.850 --> 02:25:23.130]
It would try would only come up on it

[02:25:23.130 --> 02:25:25.310]
That's because you still have possession though

[02:25:25.310 --> 02:25:25.770]
Exactly

[02:25:25.770 --> 02:25:28.190]
In other words, that's why you were trying to do it on that

[02:25:28.190 --> 02:25:32.390]
If it's a bad snap if it's a bad snap and the holder recovers and gets tackled

[02:25:32.390 --> 02:25:35.530]
Now if you did that on third down now it becomes fourth down

[02:25:35.530 --> 02:25:36.890]
But you still have possession of the ball

[02:25:36.890 --> 02:25:37.590]
Exactly

[02:25:37.590 --> 02:25:39.610]
But this guy's talking about

[02:25:39.610 --> 02:25:40.350]
Right

[02:25:40.350 --> 02:25:42.890]
If you line up and kick the ball you can't kick it again

[02:25:42.890 --> 02:25:44.550]
Of course not once you kick it away

[02:25:44.550 --> 02:25:47.250]
That's what I tried to tell a guy very matter of frankly as well

[02:25:47.250 --> 02:25:49.190]
How come you can if it goes in the crowd

[02:25:49.190 --> 02:25:51.070]
What differences to make where it goes

[02:25:51.070 --> 02:25:52.670]
It doesn't make any difference but once you

[02:25:52.670 --> 02:25:54.050]
But you can attempt to

[02:25:54.990 --> 02:25:56.190]
Punt or you can

[02:25:56.190 --> 02:25:57.610]
Well it only comes up with a field goal

[02:25:57.610 --> 02:26:00.390]
You can attempt to make up to a ball on second to third down

[02:26:01.470 --> 02:26:05.210]
Muff this nap never kick it line up again and kick it again from 10 years further

[02:26:05.210 --> 02:26:06.390]
I think Muff is the word

[02:26:07.170 --> 02:26:08.090]
Okay pal thanks

[02:26:08.670 --> 02:26:13.570]
Okay we have two open lines in brown word 5249463524WOD

[02:26:14.070 --> 02:26:16.190]
So what are we going to do about this Nudnik kid huh

[02:26:16.190 --> 02:26:17.130]
What are we going to do about him

[02:26:17.130 --> 02:26:18.450]
What did I tell you about Stoy Annabitch

[02:26:18.450 --> 02:26:20.530]
And it was money everybody now says yeah it was money

[02:26:20.530 --> 02:26:23.470]
Even though Pete took less they didn't want to pay out them but this kid works cheap

[02:26:23.470 --> 02:26:25.210]
So big deal he kicks

[02:26:25.210 --> 02:26:27.750]
See one thing I don't care about this kicking the ball off deep

[02:26:27.750 --> 02:26:30.190]
If you have confidence in your defense

[02:26:30.810 --> 02:26:33.290]
Whether the other team starts on the 20 yard line

[02:26:33.290 --> 02:26:37.410]
Or the 27 or 30 yard line really shouldn't make all that much difference

[02:26:37.910 --> 02:26:42.170]
But when you have no confidence that the guys even going to make extra points much less the field goals

[02:26:42.170 --> 02:26:45.490]
And the first one that he did make by the way just to got inside that upright

[02:26:46.030 --> 02:26:48.290]
I got no confidence in Joe Nudnik I'm sorry

[02:26:48.890 --> 02:26:50.870]
I'll take the guy who puts the points on the board

[02:26:50.870 --> 02:26:55.490]
Thank you and as far as the extra five or six yards on a kickoff big deal if he got some defense

[02:26:56.970 --> 02:26:58.350]
Here's a mobile and Davie hello

[02:26:58.350 --> 02:27:01.670]
Yeah he's a 50% kicker in college and that's exactly what he is now

[02:27:01.670 --> 02:27:03.430]
He sucks he sucks okay

[02:27:03.430 --> 02:27:06.130]
Yeah I gotta tell you I'm Pete Soyanabitch is a rough ball

[02:27:06.990 --> 02:27:10.130]
And I was uh I can't believe what they did

[02:27:10.130 --> 02:27:13.690]
They did and the world and the biggest insult is they just gave him away

[02:27:13.690 --> 02:27:17.110]
Yeah they gave him the Kansas City for like an 85th round draft tour

[02:27:17.110 --> 02:27:18.170]
I'm a fifth round draft

[02:27:18.170 --> 02:27:18.630]
Right

[02:27:19.110 --> 02:27:20.030]
Yeah I love Pete

[02:27:20.030 --> 02:27:23.590]
Well that's because they know he's gonna go to Probo because they're all gonna be both before him

[02:27:23.590 --> 02:27:23.990]
Okay

[02:27:23.990 --> 02:27:24.970]
Yeah I'm thankful

[02:27:24.970 --> 02:27:26.010]
I tell him we wish him well

[02:27:26.010 --> 02:27:26.550]
All right

[02:27:26.550 --> 02:27:27.370]
Okay bye bye

[02:27:27.370 --> 02:27:29.050]
Pete Soyanabitch is God

[02:27:29.050 --> 02:27:31.210]
Yeah he missed a few here in here in the last couple of years

[02:27:31.210 --> 02:27:35.150]
Big deal everybody misses him soon or later but I got news for it when the money is on the line

[02:27:35.150 --> 02:27:40.290]
If there was a 52 yarder like that one yesterday I guarantee you Pete would have stuck it right through there and the ball too

[02:27:40.890 --> 02:27:42.350]
Say it like this

[02:27:42.950 --> 02:27:43.390]
610

[02:27:43.390 --> 02:27:44.610]
W i

[02:27:44.610 --> 02:27:45.770]
Oh baby

[02:27:45.770 --> 02:27:47.030]
I'm for glory

[02:27:47.030 --> 02:27:49.010]
News talking entertainment radio

[02:27:49.730 --> 02:27:50.170]
610

[02:27:50.170 --> 02:27:51.890]
W i o d

[02:27:51.890 --> 02:27:53.670]
The one to do our

[02:28:00.130 --> 02:28:00.730]
Yeah

[02:28:01.570 --> 02:28:08.450]
The makers of fail-packed eight diarrhea really formula introduced long-lasting fail-packed eight supositories honey

[02:28:08.450 --> 02:28:09.630]
Are you okay?

[02:28:09.910 --> 02:28:11.510]
Oh it's this darn diarrhea

[02:28:11.510 --> 02:28:15.250]
Try new pale-packed eight supositories I put some in the medicine cabinet

[02:28:15.250 --> 02:28:16.570]
supositories huh

[02:28:16.570 --> 02:28:22.650]
Fail-packed eight supositories go right to the seat of the problem for instant relief at last for days if not years

[02:28:22.650 --> 02:28:25.970]
Honey why is there a tennis ball in the medicine cabinet

[02:28:25.970 --> 02:28:28.270]
That's not a tennis ball that's a supository

[02:28:28.830 --> 02:28:33.070]
The package says it has unique blocking action to stop diarrhea fast

[02:28:33.070 --> 02:28:34.490]
Yeah for a horse maybe

[02:28:34.490 --> 02:28:35.370]
He's trying it

[02:28:35.370 --> 02:28:35.950]
Okay

[02:28:36.510 --> 02:28:37.110]
Wow

[02:28:37.110 --> 02:28:38.230]
How's it feel?

[02:28:38.410 --> 02:28:39.370]
Like a tennis ball

[02:28:39.370 --> 02:28:41.510]
Jesus how long does it take for this thing to dissolve

[02:28:41.510 --> 02:28:44.070]
Oh it doesn't dissolve it just sits there

[02:28:44.070 --> 02:28:44.490]
What?

[02:28:44.830 --> 02:28:45.430]
Blocking

[02:28:45.430 --> 02:28:46.270]
Oh god

[02:28:46.270 --> 02:28:49.490]
New pale-packed eight supositories with unique blocking action

[02:28:49.490 --> 02:28:55.030]
And for really severe diarrhea try a pale-packed eight extra large supositories with a patented football shape

[02:28:55.690 --> 02:28:57.250]
Okay 106 at W.O.D.

[02:28:57.310 --> 02:28:59.570]
Maybe that's what the dolphins could use some more runs blocking

[02:28:59.570 --> 02:29:03.890]
We have an open line of Broward 5249463524 W.O.D.

[02:29:03.890 --> 02:29:05.150]
Nice catch by the way Karim

[02:29:05.150 --> 02:29:06.470]
Hold the Karim please

[02:29:06.470 --> 02:29:07.650]
Oops there it goes

[02:29:08.970 --> 02:29:11.150]
Bernie finally gets away from these bastards

[02:29:11.150 --> 02:29:13.850]
Just one time one time with like a couple minutes left in the game

[02:29:13.850 --> 02:29:15.490]
We have one last dying gas

[02:29:15.490 --> 02:29:18.250]
Banner own like 15-17 yard line where the hell it is

[02:29:18.250 --> 02:29:21.410]
One time he gets away and throws a nice little screen pass

[02:29:21.410 --> 02:29:23.650]
A lovely little passes Harry Neal would say

[02:29:23.650 --> 02:29:25.330]
Oops it's on the ground

[02:29:27.050 --> 02:29:28.790]
There goes that Lou Alcindor again

Oh you didn't put it down. Oh no

[02:30:47.150 --> 02:30:49.870]
Oh jeez I gotta look at a waist basket for that card again

[02:30:50.310 --> 02:30:53.150]
I mean I don't want to sound ungrateful because it's a really beautiful neat

[02:30:53.150 --> 02:30:55.750]
Thing and it was like four hundred of her business cards in here

[02:30:55.750 --> 02:31:00.430]
And I appreciated very much but I can't find her card while she knows thank you. I think it was Laura

[02:31:01.870 --> 02:31:06.550]
So anyway, it's the hurricane tracking chart. It's got pictures here on the map of all the uh

[02:31:06.550 --> 02:31:08.870]
Hurricanes release some of them and they don't have room for all of them

[02:31:08.870 --> 02:31:13.610]
The ones who've been either suspended or pending or this or that and it's a beautiful thing

[02:31:13.610 --> 02:31:16.590]
And on the back it says dedicated to

[02:31:19.470 --> 02:31:21.610]
What does that say on the back oh

[02:31:22.290 --> 02:31:26.570]
Read read I didn't even see this dedicated to reinstate you

[02:31:27.410 --> 02:31:30.730]
That's the new name for University of Miami reinstate you

[02:31:30.730 --> 02:31:36.150]
And how about those uh koon Huskers that got beat on the weekend too. God was that beautiful

[02:31:36.650 --> 02:31:37.470]
Arizona State

[02:31:37.470 --> 02:31:43.530]
Exactly a slice of revenge for the 77 points that the koon Huskers ran up on him last year

[02:31:43.530 --> 02:31:45.730]
With their semi-pro football team and

[02:31:45.730 --> 02:31:49.650]
Prouncing him 19 to nothing which may not sound like a trouncing but from all accounts

[02:31:49.650 --> 02:31:53.230]
They really they stuck it to them. All right, Arizona State

[02:31:54.650 --> 02:31:57.090]
What is that what's all that distortion on there now?

[02:31:58.010 --> 02:32:01.410]
Are you hearing that that's not from the computer is it

[02:32:02.790 --> 02:32:05.350]
From the computer the hotkey or is that a card

[02:32:05.350 --> 02:32:05.510]
card

[02:32:07.870 --> 02:32:09.330]
Could it be the pot?

[02:32:10.110 --> 02:32:10.590]
Oh

[02:32:16.790 --> 02:32:19.310]
Let's just keep doing that one more time

[02:32:21.970 --> 02:32:22.790]
It's the pot

[02:32:23.750 --> 02:32:27.990]
We don't have a pot to kiss in how do you like that which pot it's two pots

[02:32:28.830 --> 02:32:31.110]
Oh, geez, it's Roosevelt pots

[02:32:36.510 --> 02:32:40.310]
What did all with the uh the volume the gain on that pot

[02:32:40.850 --> 02:32:45.770]
Oh, how do I know which one it is there's two different pots i'm didlin. I'm didlin. I'm didlin. Okay

[02:32:47.670 --> 02:32:53.190]
Okay, listen don't worry about it now. Okay, we're only gonna be here to what another five ten years in this building

[02:32:53.190 --> 02:32:57.070]
Before we move over that the brand new packs and nothing which they're thinking about building someday

[02:32:57.690 --> 02:33:03.410]
When they worry about getting my paycheck situation straight and out and taking a look at the what real life is all about

[02:33:03.410 --> 02:33:05.150]
Then they can start worrying about building some buildings

[02:33:05.650 --> 02:33:07.850]
Anyway, let's go to a Miami Beach hello

[02:33:08.890 --> 02:33:14.670]
Hello, yes, sir. How we doing great first time caller, but i've been listening to you off and on for years

[02:33:15.170 --> 02:33:17.810]
Uh, I'm talking about the counterfeit bills. It's very interesting

[02:33:18.530 --> 02:33:19.830]
Basically, you deal with any bank

[02:33:20.270 --> 02:33:27.110]
Uh, they've only enough to go in your one way or another sooner or later. Yeah, but the basic rule was caveat mTOR not the buyer beware

[02:33:27.830 --> 02:33:28.790]
but the customer beware

[02:33:29.790 --> 02:33:33.930]
and uh, bank space of the second lowest profession tax tax culture being the lowest

[02:33:34.890 --> 02:33:40.430]
And uh, really if you want if you want to know about your money all of its counterfeit because none of it's backed up by gold

[02:33:40.430 --> 02:33:45.070]
Okay, thank you so much. We have an open line in day get that guy together with that other one

[02:33:45.070 --> 02:33:48.850]
I was talking about the federal reserve and we'll have a mass snatch a match made in heaven

[02:33:49.530 --> 02:33:56.530]
Open line in date county seven five one w-y-o-d two and brownered five two four nine four six three five two four

[02:33:57.730 --> 02:34:03.810]
Let's go for the gold and go for the gusto and have a couple of drinks and cut the crap 11 after one a w-y-o-d

[02:34:04.450 --> 02:34:05.510]
Ah, mom

[02:34:05.510 --> 02:34:12.510]
Raisin brand again same old same old maybe it's time you gave your kids something different for breakfast

[02:34:12.510 --> 02:34:15.790]

Serve crunchies all right mom serve crunchies your kids will love the taste and the fun

[02:34:22.630 --> 02:34:27.670]
Searching through the light crispy flakes for mass burials of crunchy nuts here they are

Serve crunchies. There's even a board game on the back of the box. Hey, you can't land there. That's my you and safe even

[02:34:49.890 --> 02:34:56.050]
We'll see if in these final three days the Cox people have any pride left whatsoever which we seriously doubt since they don't give a crap

[02:34:57.350 --> 02:35:04.970]
Here's a bokeh on a purple line. Hello. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. I heard somebody speaking before about the nation's bank

[02:35:05.650 --> 02:35:12.250]
And they really pissed me off my wife when I moved down to Florida. We went to transfer our account into nation's bank

[02:35:12.250 --> 02:35:16.890]
Yeah, and we made a sizable deposit and all of a sudden about two weeks later

[02:35:17.450 --> 02:35:23.450]
They told us that they found some derogatory information on a credit report and

[02:35:24.410 --> 02:35:24.890]
they

[02:35:25.990 --> 02:35:27.450]
They didn't want to

[02:35:28.250 --> 02:35:32.990]
They didn't want your business. They didn't want our business. Anyway, they wanted to give you the business

[02:35:32.990 --> 02:35:38.570]
Well, they gave me the business and we found out we were dealing with a bunch of glory. I'm up in Washington somewhere

[02:35:38.570 --> 02:35:44.910]
Yeah, and what happened was they didn't want to refund the funds because they said it's gonna make 30 days

[02:35:44.910 --> 02:35:51.130]
We're not a town check to clear and 30 days and like somebody is gonna believe that okay in 30 days

[02:35:51.130 --> 02:35:58.190]
30 days you could take the check and walk it up to that bank out of town and cash it and walk back again and still have days left over

[02:35:58.190 --> 02:36:03.550]
Well, I call the civil liberties union and this is the old civil liberties union

[02:36:03.550 --> 02:36:13.250]
That's correct and they and they said that that that's that's discrimination and it's against it's against both federal laws to be discriminatory

[02:36:13.250 --> 02:36:19.730]
You're not applying for credit. You're only opening a checking account right and the checking account is only with your funds right

[02:36:20.250 --> 02:36:23.430]
And and they have no right they have no right to do it

[02:36:23.430 --> 02:36:28.270]
If you had an account in there and you had problems then they have a right to ask you to leave the bank right

[02:36:28.270 --> 02:36:34.210]
But not not under new account and if more people would write letters into Washington to the federal reserve

[02:36:34.210 --> 02:36:38.990]
No, I think more people would stop doing business with folks like that and start to do a business with smaller banks

[02:36:38.990 --> 02:36:42.530]
Then we all get all on the bed it really is really is disgusting

[02:36:42.530 --> 02:36:47.530]
And I have I'm in a nice bank down here in Florida and and it's a pleasure dealing with them

[02:36:47.530 --> 02:36:53.530]
Thank God, but nation nations bank. I don't think anybody should put one dollar of their money in that bank

[02:36:54.210 --> 02:36:55.210]
I'm taking it out

[02:36:55.690 --> 02:36:57.270]
When in doubt I'm moving out

[02:36:57.890 --> 02:37:01.930]
Hey, you you got the right idea. Okay, pal. Keep up the good work. Happy circus

[02:37:01.930 --> 02:37:03.810]
Okay, okay, bye

[02:37:04.370 --> 02:37:08.190]
Open line any purple line pound IOD we got one indeed we got one in brown we got one over here

[02:37:08.190 --> 02:37:11.730]
We got one over there we got one in this bank. We got one on that we got the boardwalk park place

[02:37:13.070 --> 02:37:15.910]
Oh, man see this is what happens when you get a monopoly

[02:37:15.910 --> 02:37:19.730]
That's where the boardwalk in a park place come in. It's a big gigantic monopoly

[02:37:19.730 --> 02:37:24.670]
It's like a gigantic octopus whose testicles and tentacles are grabbing up everybody in all directions

[02:37:24.670 --> 02:37:29.350]
And if you don't like the way they do business too bad because there ain't nobody else. That's what they're hoping for

[02:37:29.890 --> 02:37:34.470]
That's right and wouldn't it be great to see city bank come tumbling down with that mexican scandal, huh?

[02:37:34.790 --> 02:37:36.750]
Wouldn't that be great to see one of those big giant

[02:37:37.630 --> 02:37:40.070]
Octopi just take a big tumble and a big leap

[02:37:41.430 --> 02:37:47.570]
Here is the forlauderdale. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. Yeah, I want to explain about nations bank. Uh, I

[02:37:47.570 --> 02:37:50.890]
uh deposit funds and nations bank a few months ago. Yes, sir

[02:37:50.890 --> 02:37:54.130]
We get back from vacation house where we're having checks bouncing

[02:37:54.130 --> 02:37:57.370]
We can't we don't understand why and the

[02:37:57.370 --> 02:38:05.030]
Manager made the deposit for us. They said there was some problem with the deposit. They deducted 25,000 out of our account to this day

[02:38:05.550 --> 02:38:10.610]
They just gave it back to us but it took like a month to get it back. They had no explanation. They don't know where it went

[02:38:13.110 --> 02:38:14.650]
Nice and and uh

[02:38:15.150 --> 02:38:16.750]
It's like so frustrating because

[02:38:17.330 --> 02:38:23.250]
We deposit like on the first they can give us credit till the 23rd and it's our money and the bank management deposit

[02:38:23.770 --> 02:38:24.210]
Beautiful

[02:38:24.830 --> 02:38:31.970]
Nations is just uh one of those a nightmare a nightmare man a nightmare waiting to happen our money into the bank

[02:38:31.970 --> 02:38:36.230]
They had it. They showed it. We had the slips on it and somewhere up north

[02:38:36.230 --> 02:38:42.310]
Somebody deducted out their computers are so hazardous now. Yeah, I feel that there's so much bank fraud going

[02:38:42.310 --> 02:38:46.550]
Well, especially the people who are operating a man you got no idea just like I discovered yesterday here

[02:38:46.550 --> 02:38:52.530]
These 250 cents being taken off the payments that I made to the IRS now granted it's only a dollar there

[02:38:52.530 --> 02:38:53.990]
But that's only two transactions

[02:38:53.990 --> 02:38:57.990]
I'm not seeing all the other ones and I'm not seeing the thousands of other customers that they got

[02:38:57.990 --> 02:39:00.130]
It's a nice racket if you can get it

[02:39:00.130 --> 02:39:04.990]
It's be if they didn't even explain or have a have a comeback for whatever happened to it

[02:39:04.990 --> 02:39:07.890]
Because they have a back in now they haven't got a clue man

[02:39:07.890 --> 02:39:11.530]
The right hand don't have any idea which rectum the left hand is up trust me

[02:39:11.530 --> 02:39:15.790]
It's amazing. I wish to be able to open some small banks where you have personal uh

[02:39:16.390 --> 02:39:19.410]
You know with people around you like with real people right of uh

[02:39:20.010 --> 02:39:24.510]
Of courtesy. Yeah, there is none. Okay. Good luck to us pal. Okay

[02:39:25.410 --> 02:39:28.630]
Family bank that's our one last hope anyway out there in Westbroward

[02:39:28.630 --> 02:39:33.410]
That's the last gas we're gonna put we don't want to put a lot of weight on match shoulders out there at family bank

[02:39:33.410 --> 02:39:38.870]
But we just did okay tomorrow. I'm going in there with a with a bushel basket full of uh coins

[02:39:39.590 --> 02:39:43.630]
Not money. I think I'm gonna trust him with real money in the beginning. Let's see how they operate

[02:39:44.170 --> 02:39:48.610]
Open line in power at 524946 and guess what today didn't make it. How do you like that?

[02:39:49.950 --> 02:39:54.170]
Probably had to wait 40 minutes for that but guess what didn't make it today. Uh-huh redneck

[02:39:55.310 --> 02:39:59.170]
20 after one at WYOD if you use talking entertainment radio

[02:40:00.510 --> 02:40:02.830]
610 W I O D

[02:40:02.830 --> 02:40:08.170]
Well, mother you mentioned I really don't know if we do have it or not. I don't uh, I think the answer is oh no

[02:40:09.170 --> 02:40:13.310]
I don't think it's in there. Oh now that I take a puke at it. I think it's oh

[02:40:13.870 --> 02:40:18.990]
It's in there. So screw will just put it on now. We'll have all that good news stuff. Anyway in a few days. Won't wait we won't

[02:40:19.870 --> 02:40:23.290]
Okay, 123 at W I O D. Here's the deer field. Hello

[02:40:23.290 --> 02:40:25.110]
Hello Neil. Yes, uh

[02:40:25.110 --> 02:40:27.930]
First of all, I got a couple things to say first of all

[02:40:27.930 --> 02:40:35.910]
Maybe if we pay Karim Abdul a little more he can hold on to the bell. I doubt it. Can you believe that hold the Karim please

[02:40:36.390 --> 02:40:42.470]
In the clutch play I say we change his name back to Lou Alcindor Jr. Now and he can't go back to that Karim bull crap until he starts

[02:40:42.470 --> 02:40:46.890]
Either run and better or catch into ball or both. He stuck the joint out last night

[02:40:46.890 --> 02:40:51.610]
The pressure was on and he blew it. Yeah, just like D on the other night in that uh

[02:40:51.610 --> 02:40:56.010]
I love that maybe then right there at the end of the game. It was a beautiful thing. I loved it

[02:40:56.650 --> 02:41:02.610]
Tell me something why hasn't Jerry Jones the owner of Dallas? Why doesn't he show his face when they were getting embarrassed by the bills

[02:41:02.610 --> 02:41:06.110]
Do you notice that like when they're winning he's on the sidelines and uh

[02:41:06.110 --> 02:41:12.110]
But when they're losing he's gone he was down there on a sideline was he I think or no that was the week before

[02:41:12.110 --> 02:41:15.730]
That's when they lost to the pulse remember when vanyul hit the crossbar. Uh huh

[02:41:15.730 --> 02:41:20.510]
No, but for the for the bills game. I think when you want to know why because it was raining he don't want to get wet

[02:41:21.150 --> 02:41:27.490]
He don't want to get wet and there was there was a swisher with that bluish moth over his head back like a shroud

[02:41:27.490 --> 02:41:33.890]
He looked like something out of the Vatican here for crying a lot. He wanted to be anywhere else, but there he was trying to crawl into a hole

[02:41:33.890 --> 02:41:35.510]
I loved it. It was a beautiful thing

[02:41:35.510 --> 02:41:39.690]
I'm gonna tell you as long as bury swisher is in Dallas. I hope they lose every game

[02:41:39.690 --> 02:41:40.810]
Well, what they're saying though

[02:41:40.810 --> 02:41:46.310]
This is the first year that Dallas actually is not um riding on what you're not in red up. Right

[02:41:46.310 --> 02:41:50.650]
This is his team now and it's evident that they uh, they can't really handle it

[02:41:50.650 --> 02:41:56.550]
But who knows we'll see what happens. I just happy to see the dynasty go down and isn't it great since Jerry Jones has been such an asshole

[02:41:56.550 --> 02:41:58.770]
And besides he's running his own league over there in Dallas

[02:41:58.770 --> 02:42:02.230]
Isn't it great to see him given Emmett all of that money and Emmett to you know

[02:42:02.230 --> 02:42:04.250]
Basically sticking the joint out and it's him

[02:42:04.250 --> 02:42:09.650]
Michael getting all of that money and the being suspended five games and being in a wing somewhere waiting to go beat somebody up

[02:42:09.650 --> 02:42:12.590]
This is the Abtonia what goes around comes around man

[02:42:12.590 --> 02:42:15.370]
I've never seen said that that's what goes to show you though

[02:42:15.370 --> 02:42:19.190]
You can't buy yourself a good team. I mean to coach one and have good talent

[02:42:19.190 --> 02:42:24.130]
But if you spend all that money on Dion Emmett and Troy Ackman and everybody

[02:42:24.130 --> 02:42:28.670]
It still doesn't mean that you're gonna get a championship team man. Thank God for that. All right

[02:42:28.670 --> 02:42:32.710]
In closing no team that was one in three has ever won the Super Bowl

[02:42:32.710 --> 02:42:34.670]
Go down

[02:42:34.670 --> 02:42:38.850]
Okay, well that sounded even better. I was gonna check that I was gonna test it at works

[02:42:38.850 --> 02:42:39.590]
I fixed it

[02:42:39.590 --> 02:42:44.830]
Okay, I fixed it where the engineers wouldn't do what I fixed it. I went click like that and fixed it

[02:42:45.470 --> 02:42:50.270]
Well, okay, maybe that's all it took but of course that would take too much of their time because they're all worried about the coast

[02:42:50.270 --> 02:42:51.430]
And how it went out so hot 105

[02:42:52.090 --> 02:42:54.690]
So why don't they moving in their new building? Why don't they get in out of here?

[02:42:55.690 --> 02:42:57.850]
Why don't they get in out of our building

[02:43:00.010 --> 02:43:05.170]
Since we have 10 days to terrorize them and to park in what they've thought was their parking spots

[02:43:05.810 --> 02:43:09.990]
And it turned to get out there on a I still say Monday afternoon if Rick Riley's got any balls

[02:43:09.990 --> 02:43:12.350]
They'll be out there changing that marquee out front

[02:43:13.470 --> 02:43:20.370]
If Rick Riley has got even a tiny pair of ball bearings Monday afternoon their first afternoon show Hill of Adam or somebody out there

[02:43:20.370 --> 02:43:23.570]
Changing that marquee in front of in front of our building

[02:43:24.110 --> 02:43:26.410]
Saying W-Y-O-D God

[02:43:27.710 --> 02:43:28.150]
Down

[02:43:29.170 --> 02:43:32.010]
Yeah, we've been going down for like four months now

[02:43:33.310 --> 02:43:36.430]
Get that damn cart out of there will you okay? Thank you

[02:43:37.050 --> 02:43:39.930]
Here's a book on a purple line. Hello. Hey Neil. Yes, sir

[02:43:40.630 --> 02:43:46.370]
Story about nations bank. I know another one on another one. There's a million nations bank stories in the naked city

[02:43:46.370 --> 02:43:52.070]
We're gonna hear them all. Yeah, but I know where your guys money went. Yeah, I made a deposit for eight hundred dollars

[02:43:53.110 --> 02:44:00.850]
About oh four five days later. I get my uh my statement from the bank. You know the monthly statement you got eight thousand dollars 80 million

[02:44:02.010 --> 02:44:08.430]
Ha ha a million dollars. Yeah, no got no almost the bad no shot. Yeah, no shot

[02:44:08.430 --> 02:44:13.950]
So I immediately go up to the bank. That's what you had to getting the money no shot. Yeah, that's right

[02:44:13.950 --> 02:44:16.610]
I immediately go up to the bank though and check my

[02:44:17.390 --> 02:44:24.130]
On the ATM I checked my balance. Yeah, well they had they had taken the money out otherwise. I was opening up a

[02:44:24.710 --> 02:44:27.590]
Account in the Cayman's and I'm gonna wire it out right

[02:44:28.190 --> 02:44:30.410]
Open up all those Swiss bank accounts. That's right

[02:44:31.010 --> 02:44:33.610]
But I got there a little later than they did dammit

[02:44:33.610 --> 02:44:36.110]
But so that's where your money went anyway probably

[02:44:36.850 --> 02:44:39.490]
Okay, Neil. Okay, have a good time with it pal. Bye. See ya

[02:44:39.930 --> 02:44:42.890]

Here's a hollywood hello

[02:45:40.450 --> 02:45:44.930]
Neil yes sir good topic for two days bank and because I never expected two days

[02:45:44.930 --> 02:45:49.290]
But I'm gonna tell you something there's an endless supply of four bastards getting ripped off and screwed around

[02:45:49.290 --> 02:45:53.050]
Oh and self-flowered a bank and you can talk about this all week you'll have the phone split up good

[02:45:53.050 --> 02:45:54.450]
Okay sounds good to me

[02:45:54.450 --> 02:45:57.470]
Socks installed flower. Yeah, and you know

[02:45:57.470 --> 02:46:02.450]
I've got a horror story with bond at bank if I can share good excellent. That's Rick Riley's favorite

[02:46:02.450 --> 02:46:06.870]
Well, let me tell you I've got a cd account with them and the savings and the check-in now every month

[02:46:06.870 --> 02:46:12.050]
I get my interest from my cd and I'll go to the bank and I'll cash it and you know use it for whatever

[02:46:12.950 --> 02:46:15.890]
Well one day I did that and the next day

[02:46:15.890 --> 02:46:20.750]
I what I do is I put it into my savings account this interest money this one time next day

[02:46:20.750 --> 02:46:22.450]
I was gonna use some money for my savings account

[02:46:22.450 --> 02:46:25.330]
I said well let me call and see what I've got for a balance

[02:46:25.850 --> 02:46:28.850]
Well, I'll be whole I noticed that there's like $60 missing

[02:46:29.310 --> 02:46:33.730]
I said but wait why would I have 60 missing when I just put it deposit in yesterday

[02:46:33.730 --> 02:46:40.910]
Yeah, I've verified with the bank that when I went and cash an interest check from their bank the dumb broad

[02:46:41.570 --> 02:46:45.550]
holds the check for one day from their bank. I get my account. Yeah

[02:46:46.130 --> 02:46:48.110]
From their from their bank. They're big

[02:46:48.650 --> 02:46:52.370]
I said big and sucks down here. There's no two ways about it

[02:46:52.370 --> 02:46:57.370]
And it always is like they're looking for some way to stick it to you in other words

[02:46:57.370 --> 02:47:01.310]
It never the transactions just don't kind of go through as a matter of routine

[02:47:01.310 --> 02:47:04.630]
They're always looking for some way to put a hold to

[02:47:05.090 --> 02:47:09.550]
Bounce to do this to do something now. Let's say you go and make it the positive today

[02:47:09.550 --> 02:47:14.990]
Yeah, before the time of four o'clock and it says old transactions made before or after four for the next hour

[02:47:14.990 --> 02:47:18.170]
Oh two o'clock in my bank. We understand that but here's the kickoff

[02:47:18.170 --> 02:47:25.590]
You can make that deposit before the time but do you realize that is not credited to your account until that deposit goes to

[02:47:25.590 --> 02:47:28.090]
It's called an auditing department at night

[02:47:28.750 --> 02:47:32.930]
Then it gets posted to your account. Yeah, that's what they do down here

[02:47:32.930 --> 02:47:36.010]
And that's what screws things up too. It's not automatic

[02:47:36.010 --> 02:47:37.590]
But when you say it goes through an auditing

[02:47:38.430 --> 02:47:42.130]
Well that makes it sound like somebody's paying attention if that's the case

[02:47:42.130 --> 02:47:46.230]
How could they have bounced an eight thousand dollar check? I wrote to myself when there was

[02:47:46.970 --> 02:47:52.650]
8123 dollars right there in the computer for a balance because the auditing department themselves at night screwed up

[02:47:52.650 --> 02:47:59.530]
Oh nice very nice very nice auditing department over there at nibhilan cleary at the uh promenade plaza

[02:48:00.090 --> 02:48:05.050]
They need a good baffon ghoul or snorkel. That's what they need right okay. I'm gonna do it for them. Take it okay pal

[02:48:05.770 --> 02:48:08.410]
That's what they need they need they need a foot up their record

[02:48:08.410 --> 02:48:12.090]
That's what they need to wake those bastards up. Who was that was that Steve Nikolai just saw there

[02:48:12.770 --> 02:48:18.910]
So what's the story is he's still with us is he against us and what we already know that I mean is he gonna be around what's the deal now

[02:48:18.910 --> 02:48:24.630]
Oh, he's only sticking around if we can do the Phil Henry show tonight. Okay. Well, we'll find that out. I'll ask Phil

[02:48:25.530 --> 02:48:28.690]
Two open lines and Broward what are you laughing about that's the emis

[02:48:31.650 --> 02:48:32.450]
5249463524 wiod

[02:48:33.550 --> 02:48:36.610]
Oh the lady and my knees back see I put around whole I knew she'd be back

[02:48:37.730 --> 02:48:42.950]
Hello, yes, ma'am hi. I'm sorry that I was going I'm calling you from work. Why I fingered as much

[02:48:44.090 --> 02:48:48.910]
The thing is that I have been dying to get through to you because the same thing happened to me and they should make it happen to you

[02:48:48.910 --> 02:48:50.530]
Nations bank here we go again

[02:48:50.530 --> 02:48:55.530]
I'm I hope that all of those nations bank eight million executives are listening right now

[02:48:55.530 --> 02:48:56.730]
It's not just neo-rodgers

[02:48:56.730 --> 02:49:00.090]
It's not just somebody who's pissed off because they screwed me around 20 or 30 times

[02:49:00.090 --> 02:49:04.170]
It's everybody in their brother out there has had it with their damn stick and attitude and we don't care

[02:49:04.170 --> 02:49:08.970]
How many other banks they buy up or how big they get it's about time they started treating people like human beings

[02:49:08.970 --> 02:49:13.090]
Go ahead and know the funny is I thought that it was just me and then when you started telling the story

[02:49:13.090 --> 02:49:16.190]
Oh, oh my god, I mean yesterday yesterday was great

[02:49:16.190 --> 02:49:19.030]
That seemed to be getting more of the action than nations

[02:49:19.030 --> 02:49:24.270]
But today the nation's bank stories are we could have 10 million of them and we haven't even scratched the surface

[02:49:24.890 --> 02:49:29.390]
It's ridiculous. I mean I um, you know, I didn't have that big of an account

[02:49:29.390 --> 02:49:32.410]
I have a student account because I'm going to college right but um

[02:49:33.010 --> 02:49:34.950]
Anyway, and so something happened

[02:49:34.950 --> 02:49:39.290]
I had one of the check cards which was the only reason that I ever used nations bank because that was pretty convenient

[02:49:39.290 --> 02:49:43.610]
Yeah, and um, so they started bouncing checks that weren't

[02:49:43.610 --> 02:49:47.810]
That shouldn't have been you know, that's their specialty and

[02:49:47.810 --> 02:49:52.350]
So they're charging me service charges for these checks are keep getting passed through two and three times

[02:49:52.350 --> 02:49:56.370]
Because I'm telling the people who are trying to get their money that know it shouldn't be bouncing

[02:49:56.370 --> 02:50:02.810]
So I get $15 you know service charges from nations bank every time that they do it only 15 oh well

[02:50:02.810 --> 02:50:07.090]
Depended on oh now it's not 27. Oh really they've moved up in the world now

[02:50:07.670 --> 02:50:14.430]
And the companies, you know that I wrote these checks to then they're charging me service charges to so I call a customer service

[02:50:14.430 --> 02:50:19.890]
And they're giving me the runaround and it takes them two weeks even find out why they bounce my checks in the first place

[02:50:19.890 --> 02:50:25.690]
And the meantime all the checks I've written since then I'm also getting bounced so I was just my whole with a getting deeper and deeper and deeper

[02:50:25.690 --> 02:50:31.530]
And then oh they sent me this letter saying no, no, it was really my fault which it wasn't and but you know for um

[02:50:32.290 --> 02:50:33.230]
They're gonna give me

[02:50:34.390 --> 02:50:40.010]
I'm worried right just for um so that I won't be upset with him and won't leave them but I left him anyway

[02:50:40.010 --> 02:50:44.930]
So I have this little bitty bank that someone you're talking about that don't charge you service charges for anything right

[02:50:44.930 --> 02:50:51.110]
Not the ATM not checks not you don't have to have a minimum balance. It doesn't matter great and uh what bank is that

[02:50:51.110 --> 02:50:54.170]
It's a little one called tropical federal is a credit union

[02:50:54.170 --> 02:50:57.590]
Okay, it's based right here in the hospital that I work at mm-hmm

[02:50:57.590 --> 02:51:05.110]
And uh, I was gonna call recommend that before the guy called about um family bank or whatever it's called they don't charge you for anything not even um

[02:51:05.610 --> 02:51:12.130]
Not even when you have cash your checks written or or money um many orders nothing yeah, they don't charge your service charges great

[02:51:12.130 --> 02:51:16.630]
Which is how may is that nickel and I'm using this in the first place. Yeah, so anyway

[02:51:16.630 --> 02:51:21.150]
I thought I'd share that with you. Well stick with the winners sweetheart. I'll try. Thanks. Thanks. Bye. Bye. Bye

[02:51:21.150 --> 02:51:31.890]
We have an open line in day at 751. We got two and brownored 5249 463524 wiod as the plot keeps getting thicker and deeper and deeper and deeper

[02:51:34.270 --> 02:51:38.690]
Because people are tired man they're fed up you can screw around with their uh brain

[02:51:38.690 --> 02:51:45.750]
You can screw around with almost anything but don't screw around with their money. Okay, you got it. Don't screw with my money

[02:51:47.550 --> 02:51:47.910]
And

[02:51:47.910 --> 02:51:53.950]
Just like this joke that's been going on here for eight years in this radio station with and you have to make it into a joke

[02:51:53.950 --> 02:51:57.710]
It's like so many things in this joint you have to make it into a joke or you never survive it

[02:52:00.310 --> 02:52:05.090]
I came here eight years ago to work and it's like well everybody else gets paid every other Thursday

[02:52:05.090 --> 02:52:07.990]
If they would have said to me you get paid when everybody else does fine

[02:52:07.990 --> 02:52:13.050]
I have no problem with that they decided you're gonna get paid every Thursday because we just can't write a check that big

[02:52:14.310 --> 02:52:16.190]
So we're gonna pay every Thursday fine

[02:52:16.870 --> 02:52:22.970]
But like how do I get it when do I get it am I gonna get it and now lea downstairs in accounting

[02:52:22.970 --> 02:52:24.270]
She's great when lea's here

[02:52:24.270 --> 02:52:28.090]
We know that George only has to call her 20 or 30 times in reminder and I'll get the check

[02:52:28.930 --> 02:52:31.570]
But prior to this it was like I can remember a couple of times

[02:52:31.570 --> 02:52:34.070]
I went out the door and then all of a sudden turned around said to myself

[02:52:34.070 --> 02:52:37.650]
Hey, guess what this is just what they were hoping for it's Thursday and I don't have my check

[02:52:37.650 --> 02:52:41.010]
Let's see if he'll let us keep the money one more day, okay?

[02:52:41.270 --> 02:52:43.210]
Is opposed to like having some kind of a system

[02:52:44.050 --> 02:52:48.330]
Like here's how it works and it'll be in your box or it'll be in your hand or whatever

[02:52:50.730 --> 02:52:53.770]
That's all just don't mess with people's money

[02:52:54.690 --> 02:52:56.390]
Is that too much to ask?

[02:52:58.630 --> 02:53:02.170]
136 at WI would use talk and entertainment radio

[02:53:02.730 --> 02:53:04.310]
16 WI

[02:53:04.310 --> 02:53:09.630]
All right, this is G Gordon Liddy and they don't come any worse than Neil Rogers

[02:53:10.170 --> 02:53:17.870]
You're upset big Johnson and this is my partner Reggie Washington and it's time once again for this old crack house

[02:53:17.870 --> 02:53:25.190]
These project is a lovely two-story condemned brick row house and Reggie I see something that needs fixing already

[02:53:25.190 --> 02:53:29.290]
That's right. You know the street numbers is painted on the curb that makes a way

[02:53:29.290 --> 02:53:33.410]
So easy for the police to find a place let's fix that Reggie

[02:53:34.390 --> 02:53:37.590]
Very good now let's check the interior

[02:53:38.490 --> 02:53:44.570]
Hmm now that we're inside, you know what it's time for time to smoke some crack

[02:53:44.570 --> 02:53:46.210]
Sam straight

[02:53:50.490 --> 02:53:57.430]
Now another big problem with crack houses is awful smell from home is vomit and on the carpet or brothers

[02:53:57.430 --> 02:54:01.710]
Pitting on the staircase like my partner Reggie's doing right now

[02:54:01.710 --> 02:54:03.070]
Look at this man

[02:54:05.350 --> 02:54:13.430]
This presents a major problem. How do you get rid of that awful odor easy smoke some more crack

[02:54:15.070 --> 02:54:19.430]
You smell anything Reggie smell smells oh

[02:54:20.510 --> 02:54:23.670]
Well, that's all the time we have for today

[02:54:24.890 --> 02:54:30.090]
Join us next week for another edition of this old crack house

[02:54:30.950 --> 02:54:34.370]
That was two packs favorite show by the way 140 at W.I.D

[02:54:34.370 --> 02:54:37.330]
We have an open line in day. See I think we're all in between the breaks here

[02:54:37.330 --> 02:54:42.370]
Everybody's asking these questions about who's gonna do what and who's on first and are they gonna be engineers here in his

[02:54:42.370 --> 02:54:46.850]
Paxing doing this uh, we're asking too many questions just show up through your show and then that's it

[02:54:47.410 --> 02:54:50.630]
Just show up dummy up and don't ask any of these questions, okay?

[02:54:50.630 --> 02:54:54.730]
And if there's problems like if there's no log or stuff like that let it be their problem

[02:54:54.730 --> 02:54:57.910]
Don't let somebody else's problem become your problem

[02:54:58.630 --> 02:55:02.310]
That's what my bank says here's a mobile and west palm hello

[02:55:02.990 --> 02:55:10.350]
Oh Neil yes sir hey all this talk about the banks I completely agree with you and I can't believe I've heard all these carts

[02:55:10.350 --> 02:55:14.010]
And the only one that really really applies to the banks I haven't heard

[02:55:14.710 --> 02:55:15.690]
You do a

[02:55:15.690 --> 02:55:23.070]

Have a great life. See you

Imagine

Okay, 151 at WI.

[02:57:07.990 --> 02:57:08.870]
That's what we're going to be doing.

[02:57:08.970 --> 02:57:12.250]
You know how these rock stations, all the stations that change the format, they do like

[02:57:12.250 --> 02:57:14.690]
three days of Louis, Louis or stupid stuff like that.

[02:57:15.150 --> 02:57:17.850]
We're going to have three straight days of joy, rentals and Drew Michaels tapes.

[02:57:18.410 --> 02:57:20.830]
Then we can be sure on Monday we're starting from scratch.

[02:57:21.910 --> 02:57:22.790]
Here's Boynton Beach.

[02:57:23.010 --> 02:57:23.130]
Hello?

[02:57:23.470 --> 02:57:23.930]
Hello, Neil.

[02:57:24.170 --> 02:57:24.470]
Yes, sir.

[02:57:24.930 --> 02:57:28.110]
I've been to pos my paycheck in Great Western back when I'm not going to let them get away

[02:57:28.110 --> 02:57:28.570]
with this today.

[02:57:28.830 --> 02:57:29.010]
Yeah.

[02:57:29.010 --> 02:57:32.190]
They got nailed yesterday, paid over and over and over again.

[02:57:32.290 --> 02:57:32.970]
They got butchered.

[02:57:33.090 --> 02:57:34.150]
They got bloody bad.

[02:57:34.290 --> 02:57:35.230]
They got to get away again.

[02:57:35.230 --> 02:57:35.850]
Finish them off, man.

[02:57:36.150 --> 02:57:40.970]
For four years, my paychecks have been drawn off of Bank of New York and they've been

[02:57:40.970 --> 02:57:41.530]
holding them.

[02:57:41.970 --> 02:57:46.490]
I had a $4.50 check that I wrote that I get the bounce twice.

[02:57:46.710 --> 02:57:47.050]
I got paid.

[02:57:47.130 --> 02:57:47.950]
I got charged $50.

[02:57:48.550 --> 02:57:54.230]
$25.00 service charges each time on a $4.50 check because they hold my payroll check

[02:57:54.230 --> 02:57:55.830]
for five days every time.

[02:57:56.730 --> 02:57:58.890]
So Neil's saying, I'm done with them.

[02:57:59.070 --> 02:57:59.310]
Good.

[02:57:59.490 --> 02:57:59.930]
Thank God.

[02:58:00.250 --> 02:58:01.690]
Tom, to blow it out there, rectum.

[02:58:01.750 --> 02:58:02.490]
It's already done.

[02:58:02.690 --> 02:58:03.090]
Have a good day.

[02:58:03.170 --> 02:58:03.450]
Excellent.

[02:58:04.210 --> 02:58:06.670]
Yeah, if they're going to keep treating you like that, I mean, when you do business with

[02:58:06.670 --> 02:58:10.250]
people for so long and you know, when you deposit a check, it's just like here with the

[02:58:10.250 --> 02:58:13.910]
Cox people is much of a bunch of bastards as they are.

[02:58:14.190 --> 02:58:15.430]
At least, you know, their checks are good.

[02:58:15.810 --> 02:58:17.110]
Unlike over there at QAM.

[02:58:17.750 --> 02:58:20.770]
At least, you know, their checks are good and you think that even though they're

[02:58:20.770 --> 02:58:25.150]
based in Atlanta, when it's an $8 billion company, they shouldn't be putting ever a hold

[02:58:25.150 --> 02:58:25.690]
on that check.

[02:58:25.850 --> 02:58:29.730]
On that particular check, you don't need to hold it to squeeze it, to digest it, to

[02:58:29.730 --> 02:58:32.230]
spit it out, to regurgitate it, to see if it's going to be okay.

[02:58:32.570 --> 02:58:33.470]
Trust me, it's okay.

[02:58:33.790 --> 02:58:35.910]
The sisters can squeeze the few thousand out, okay?

[02:58:36.730 --> 02:58:41.970]
Boy, on just another excuse, like I said, to hang onto people's money and keep making

[02:58:41.970 --> 02:58:46.470]
any interest and making any interest and use your money to make a fortune so they can pay

[02:58:46.470 --> 02:58:48.910]
all the big salaries to those tellers and the shleppers, right?

[02:58:49.170 --> 02:58:49.410]
Right.

[02:58:49.910 --> 02:58:51.270]
Here's Miami on a purple line.

[02:58:51.370 --> 02:58:51.530]
Hello.

[02:58:51.930 --> 02:58:52.610]
How are you doing, Neil?

[02:58:52.790 --> 02:58:53.050]
Okay.

[02:58:53.050 --> 02:58:54.730]
I got a couple quick stories for you.

[02:58:55.010 --> 02:58:58.790]
First story, I made a couple deposits about three months ago at Barnett Bank.

[02:58:59.650 --> 02:59:02.470]
Now the total of deposits equaled about $8,000.

[02:59:03.210 --> 02:59:07.190]
Now I wrote all my checks out and, you know, same thing that these other colleges say,

[02:59:07.490 --> 02:59:08.530]
my check starts at bounce.

[02:59:08.990 --> 02:59:11.190]
So I call Barnett who I've been with for nine years.

[02:59:11.270 --> 02:59:11.450]
Yeah.

[02:59:11.730 --> 02:59:17.310]
And they tell me that for my particular account that my checks are only good for the first

[02:59:17.310 --> 02:59:18.090]
5,000.

[02:59:18.270 --> 02:59:21.570]
Any amount after that has to be on hold for 72 hours.

[02:59:22.630 --> 02:59:24.010]
I was never told to that.

[02:59:24.390 --> 02:59:28.150]
I had never, I had never bought in $5,000 deposit in one particular time.

[02:59:28.310 --> 02:59:29.690]
I was unaware of that.

[02:59:29.830 --> 02:59:31.190]
So now my checks start.

[02:59:31.310 --> 02:59:33.650]
So in other words, they just make it up as they go along.

[02:59:34.010 --> 02:59:34.310]
Exactly.

[02:59:34.850 --> 02:59:39.210]
They only gave me, even though I've been there nine years and I've had the same job

[02:59:39.210 --> 02:59:40.690]
and I've been cash in the same paycheck.

[02:59:40.970 --> 02:59:44.790]
They only give me a $5,000 immediate transactions.

[02:59:45.130 --> 02:59:46.070]
Anything over that.

[02:59:46.070 --> 02:59:47.970]
I have to wait 72 hours.

[02:59:48.650 --> 02:59:49.030]
Beautiful.

[02:59:49.990 --> 02:59:52.910]
That's what I call great service after nine years.

[02:59:53.270 --> 02:59:53.470]
Yep.

[02:59:53.770 --> 02:59:57.630]
And you figure a big bank like that, you know, would have some kind of, you know, some

[02:59:57.630 --> 03:00:00.370]
other things, you know, to do if they want to keep their customers happy.

[03:00:00.670 --> 03:00:01.550]
Here's another one for you.

[03:00:01.870 --> 03:00:06.450]
I just got back from a cruise a couple of weeks ago and I only brought one credit card

[03:00:06.450 --> 03:00:10.290]
because I figured I'd buy a limited amount of cash and I'd have one credit card, gold

[03:00:10.290 --> 03:00:12.210]
card, plenty of big line of credit.

[03:00:12.350 --> 03:00:12.930]
I'd have no problems.

[03:00:13.490 --> 03:00:17.270]
I used the card on the boat because they have like something like a Salon Sign card where

[03:00:17.270 --> 03:00:22.050]
you give them your credit card and then they give you a limit to whatever your credit card

[03:00:22.050 --> 03:00:24.150]
limit is and you can buy things on the boat drinks, whatever.

[03:00:24.270 --> 03:00:24.430]
Right.

[03:00:25.350 --> 03:00:29.850]
So after the first day, the first half of the day, the next day where it's C and I

[03:00:29.850 --> 03:00:34.530]
try to use my, my, my Salon Sign card and the waitress tells me, well, you have to go

[03:00:34.530 --> 03:00:37.170]
to see the purse or because your credit card's not working.

[03:00:37.710 --> 03:00:42.670]
My credit card company didn't even give carnival cruise line the option to get in touch

[03:00:42.670 --> 03:00:43.050]
with me.

[03:00:43.470 --> 03:00:44.570]
They just cancelled my card.

[03:00:45.110 --> 03:00:49.210]
So now I'm stuck on a boat with the only credit card I have is that particular bank and

[03:00:49.210 --> 03:00:49.890]
I have no money.

[03:00:50.290 --> 03:00:50.950]
I don't get it.

[03:00:50.970 --> 03:00:51.990]
They cancelled your card for what?

[03:00:52.130 --> 03:00:52.250]
Yes.

[03:00:52.570 --> 03:00:57.210]
When I did the Salon Sign card, I thought that it would go through carnival but apparently

[03:00:57.210 --> 03:00:58.390]
it goes through the Caribbean.

[03:00:59.030 --> 03:01:03.070]
So they must have figured that's gotten a hold of my credit card and they cancelled it.

[03:01:03.530 --> 03:01:04.790]
They cancelled it without...
