[00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:03.300]
Talk in entertainment radio.

[00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:07.560]
610 W I O D Miami Fort Lauderdale.

[00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.740]
610 W I O D, a tax income company.

[00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:21.760]
Well, I'll ride.

[00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.940]
Presents the Neil Rogers Show to talk to Neil call 751 W I O D in date.

[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.280]
524 W I O D in Broward.

[00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.140]
Mobile colors.

[00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:31.580]
It's pound I O D.

[00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.200]
But I'll pick up the tap for that one.

[00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:38.200]
Outside of date in Broward, call 1-800-944-W I O D.

[00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:44.140]
And now the tax and O Neil Rogers Show on 610 W I O D.

[00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:44.920]
It's big, Neil.

[00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.100]
It's big in a boat of it.

[00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.440]
324 W I O D.

[00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.940]
TV has got a lady named Katty Lee.

[00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.960]
Everybody thinks that she is squeaky clean.

[00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.900]
I'm gonna go a cover now and be a think.

[00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.000]
Katty's just a snob that thinks it's not gonna stink.

[00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.920]
And now she says she's gonna often leave her show.

[00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.740]
Well, baby, just pack up all your things and go, go, go.

[00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.500]
No.

[00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.740]
Go, Katty, go, go.

[00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.460]
No.

[00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.500]
Go.

[00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.460]
No.

[00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.040]
Just go, Katty, go, just go.

[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.980]
Because you ain't that good.

[00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.060]
Because she says the television is a big way to land.

[00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.840]
Stop talking about your kids and you're done husband.

[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.260]
Don't clear on me old Frank is a loving sheen.

[00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.040]
We said I want more time and baby I'm gone to scream.

[00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.060]
Monday night football, he's as good as that.

[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:44.440]
Ain't much going on.

[00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.860]
And on a little prank he's head, go, go.

[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.400]
No.

[00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.820]
Go, Katty, go, go.

[00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.280]
Boy, baby, reach to the show.

[00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.780]
No.

[00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:55.900]
Just go, Katty, go, go.

[00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.840]
Go, Katty, go, go.

[00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.700]
No.

[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:01.940]
Nobody's that good.

[00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:04.960]
Go, go, go.

[00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.260]
Go, Katty, go.

[00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:08.900]
10-03-A-W-I-D.

[00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:09.500]
Happy Thursday.

[00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.060]
2-E-I was planning on saying one more day, one more trip.

[00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.220]
But guess what?

[00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.240]
Well, just when you think you got it licked.

[00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.080]
Just when you think you got it down to a science,

[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.280]
all of a sudden you discover things don't ever work quite

[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.040]
according to plan.

[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.220]
So we're going to have to be here Monday, maybe Tuesday,

[00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.100]
but certainly no longer than that, right?

[00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.160]
We pray we are hoping.

[00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.800]
We are praying.

[00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:29.360]
We are praying a lot.

[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.500]
In spite of what it says in the hair out here, Jeff Nudnik

[00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:32.760]
with another award winning column.

[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.920]
By the way, I forgot to tell you the amazing information

[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.580]
about Andrews ass in the woods, George.

[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.180]
Off the air, be sure to remind me about that.

[00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.480]
Which kind of like gives me some insight

[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.180]
is to why some of those pimply-faced puny kids

[00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.920]
have been working over there last year or four years.

[00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.200]
Okay.

[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.740]
So anyway, getting back to Brendan Shanahan,

[00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.260]
who keeps sticking his stick at the wrong spot,

[00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.200]
rumor is that he's going to Detroit,

[00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:57.180]
but that's beside the point.

[00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.100]
So anyway, in the sunset in the morning,

[00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.200]
here we go, higher power at WI-D ratings.

[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.420]
See, they just don't get it.

[00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.100]
They just can't get it.

[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.480]
Somebody evidently somewhere along the line

[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.800]
convinced these people, and none of them ever talked to any of us.

[00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.540]
They convinced him that once Paxton took over this radio station,

[00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.740]
we weren't going to say crap or even take one.

[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:20.460]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.400]
And they just can't understand how, you know,

[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.260]
on the one hand, here's a board again Christian,

[00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:27.060]
which is all they know.

[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.400]
That's the only thing they seem to care about,

[00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:30.400]
other than the fact that you own eight million radio stations.

[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.080]
And here's all these potty mouths on here, here's Ron and Ron.

[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.420]
What does it say that they're doing?

[00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.520]
Ron?

[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.720]
It's got little number for what each one of us are doing on here.

[00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.520]
Let's see, Ron and Ron, where is it?

[00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.540]
Come on, we know what's in here somewhere, Jeff.

[00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.280]
Oh yeah, Ron and Ron, former promoters of the band-dead German tourists.

[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.800]
Neil Rogers is gay and Jewish,

[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.200]
as if that has anything to do with anything.

[00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:54.880]
And Rick and Suds, whose signature word is butt load.

[00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.700]
And Jeff, note that he evidently finds this astonishing

[00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.540]
to think that we're still on the year here

[00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.260]
on a radio station known by Bud Paxton.

[00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.040]
Well, get used to it, okay?

[00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.380]
Get over it and get used to it and get with the program,

[00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.160]
because that's just the way it is.

[00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:10.300]
There's nothing changing.

[00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.800]
And it's amazing that he quotes me and here again,

[00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.140]
see what we've got is we've got a whole series of articles

[00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.080]
that keep being spawned out of the first one many, many months ago

[00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:20.820]
back when the station was first sold.

[00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.440]
And so people keep going back to,

[00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.680]
and they keep stealing crap from other articles,

[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:26.920]
and they never talk to anybody.

[00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.020]
And they keep making articles about it

[00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.040]
as if to give the impression that they're on top of stuff

[00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.080]
and they know what's going on.

[00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:37.360]
Now that Paxton Communications purchase of WIOD

[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.900]
from Cox Enterprises is complete,

[00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.180]
the question is whether the station's gaggle

[00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.960]
or free speaking talk host, especially Neil Rogers,

[00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.840]
will be a caboched by Board of Game Christian Bud Paxton.

[00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:48.300]
Well, what do you think so far, Jeff?

[00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:50.820]
You asshole, what do you think so far?

[00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.620]
They just can't get it.

[00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.440]
How many days, how many weeks, how many months,

[00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:59.980]
how many years is it going to take before they get the message?

[00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:03.080]
But the best part of the article is Bob Green.

[00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:04.680]
Did you read this?

[00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:05.640]
Yes I did.

[00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.840]
Oh, it's so, it's so typical,

[00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:12.620]
and so beautiful, and so to the point,

[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:13.820]
exactly what you'd expect.

[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.080]
Because keep in mind, it's not important in life that you succeed

[00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.320]
but that people are used to work for your fail.

[00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.080]
That's the most important thing,

[00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.220]
not that we succeed, but that you fail.

[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.800]
It says in radio, ratings apparently are the highest power

[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.960]
as in...

[00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:30.660]
Can't you, Don Jeff?

[00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:34.540]
Assuming the transition to WIOD goes smoothly,

[00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.320]
that doesn't mean an easy ride thereafter for Paxton.

[00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:40.140]
So said Bob Green,

[00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.580]
who was General Manager at the station until last Friday.

[00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:47.260]
He was General Manager until last Friday.

[00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.400]
I thought it was General Manager until at the end of the day Monday.

[00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:52.060]
Well, what's one day, right? Don't get your facts right.

[00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:53.800]
Jeff, just keep writing a bunch of stuff.

[00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:55.540]
So said Bob Green,

[00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.380]
Green GM at Coast and Hot 105,

[00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:01.580]
described WIOD as management intensive.

[00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:05.620]
Management intensive, meaning that these guys are a pain in the ass

[00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:07.060]
and they need a lot of babysitting,

[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.300]
which is very fascinating and light of the fact that more often than not.

[00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.700]
Remember that period of time when we had no management at all?

[00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:14.620]
In between program directors,

[00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:17.320]
when Boy Geary got bounced out before Steve Nichol came in,

[00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:18.420]
and we had no PD,

[00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:20.820]
and we were just kind of rolling long singing a song,

[00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:21.700]
showing up every day.

[00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:25.000]
And Bob Green was out of town more often than not,

[00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:26.740]
which is often the case anyway.

[00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:30.820]
And if that's the case, it's a miracle we've survived as long as we have,

[00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:35.520]
because in the last four months, there has been literally virtually no management involvement,

[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.600]
at least from his and from Bob Green's and it's like turning the other cheek

[00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.900]
and we hope you fail and that's it.

[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.720]
Although it does say it still says thanks WIOD staff on the

[00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:49.000]
unmarked key out front, which we're very grateful for Bob.

[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:55.020]
He says, Paxton doesn't know what he's in for, both positive and negative,

[00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:55.960]
says Bob Green.

[00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:01.220]
He says, people who are talented as these people require a lot of attention

[00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:04.460]
to bring out great performances and still maintain our license.

[00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:08.960]
The positive is he said that Paxton's acquiring an incredible staff of people

[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:11.040]
who will take him on a ride, he'll never forget.

[00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:14.940]
The downside may be they'll take him on a ride, he'll never forget.

[00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:19.780]
The one thing we all know in here is that Bob Green took us on a ride,

[00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:20.920]
we'll never forget.

[00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:25.200]
Even the tiny bullman never had a closer bird's eye view of what it's like to be

[00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:26.700]
mired deep inside the turret.

[00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:28.400]
Let me tell you that Bob right now.

[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.700]
I mean we can forget about anything well we won't, but we could you know set aside

[00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:36.660]
for the time being some of the stuff that happened like a year ago, two years ago,

[00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:38.940]
three and over the last three years or so or four years.

[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.980]
But the last four months, this we don't forget.

[00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:47.940]
As in, let's just watch you slide and see how far down you go before the toilet flushes

[00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:49.120]
and if you go down with it.

[00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:50.400]
Well, guess what we're still here.

[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:51.100]
How do you like that?

[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:53.140]
All of us pain in the ass guys.

[00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:55.200]
And of course, who's he really talking about?

[00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:59.320]
He says these people who are as talented as these, meaning who is he talking about?

[00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:03.080]
There's me, there's Rick, there's suds, there's the sports guys, but he sure can't be talking about them.

[00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:09.140]
Green said Phil Henry, you left WIOD on Friday to work for Cox of KF Final Los Angeles.

[00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:13.000]
Eventually we'll be syndicated in South Florida, possibly on WIOD.

[00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:16.180]
And we're holding our collective breaths right now.

[00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:18.800]
Man, each one of us is taking good deep like right.

[00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:20.080]
And that's it. Just hold it.

[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:22.420]
Hold it like Bertannin says hold it.

[00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:23.380]
Not too tight.

[00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:25.540]
So there's another great.

[00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:33.660]
And then it goes on to talk about Pax and O'Neill and Z will go from all news to mostly news on Monday when Dr. Laura and Rush Limbaugh do their thing.

[00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:34.540]
It says this lesson.

[00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:41.020]
You will move from nights at WIOD and air 10 a.m. to noon and limbaugh be noon to three on a Monday through Friday,

[00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:47.840]
which raises the other interesting point about the QAM people since they absolutely refuse to or don't know what's going on.

[00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:49.820]
How's that Andrews asking the woods by the way?

[00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:51.220]
I heard a lot of interesting stuff about that.

[00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:52.240]
That's in the woods.

[00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:53.420]
So anyway,

[00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:59.780]
there just don't seem to be anybody telling anybody what's going on, including the people who have been told that they were going to work there.

[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:00.860]
Here's the best part.

[00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:05.760]
Adding to the long list of people who allegedly were told they were going to be working at QAM, but nobody ever talked to them.

[00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:08.320]
Doug McClain, coach of our Florida Panthers.

[00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:14.080]
They get on the earth the other morning and announce, hey, the Doug McClain show is going to be on QAM Wednesday mornings eight to nine a.m.

[00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:15.400]
Only one problem folks.

[00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:16.540]
Nobody ever told Doug.

[00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:20.940]
Nobody ever talked to the coach about it.

[00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:25.380]
Nobody ever made a deal with the coach about it, but hey, they go on here anyway.

[00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:27.800]
So I guess Jimmy syphilis is going to be working there.

[00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:28.940]
Rimmer is going to be working there.

[00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:30.300]
Ned Smith is going to be working there.

[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:32.520]
Everybody is going to be working there.

[00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:39.200]
And now that I hear this stuff about Andrews, askin' what's going to understand why Rimmer and going to be working here.

[00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:39.780]
He's too old.

[00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:42.940]
So anyway, that's the latest.

[00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:49.840]
We got all kinds of stuff about TCI here, which seems to be the real thing that everybody is up at arms of I got a memo here that I'm not supposed to have.

[00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:54.000]
And this is not the one that was sent to me yesterday, by the way, that's in confidential and don't you dare read it.

[00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:57.140]
Now, this is one that somebody sent to me who like slipped it out of there.

[00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:05.560]
About how they're very concerned about their relations with the public and yada yada yada yada and custom rann amosity may get worse before it gets better.

[00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:08.980]
Please continue to put the customer first philosophy to work.

[00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:13.000]
It's interesting that they would put that out in a memo because yesterday I know somebody who called there.

[00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:19.720]
Somebody who's got a lot of books, by the way, and called there about complaining about the TCI thing in no sports channel.

[00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:26.240]
And the operator on the other end said, get the small dish in kind of a curtway and good luck to you and goodbye.

[00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:30.060]
And that's it. Get the small just get the dish. Okay, and get lost.

[00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:35.500]
So obviously TCI is very concerned about their customers and maintaining public relations in this community.

[00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:40.060]
Before we get into that, though, here's another facts another isolated incident that only I would bring up.

[00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:43.240]
Priest admits to 15 year marriage and other resigns.

[00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:49.520]
St. Petersburg, a Roman Catholic priest was suspended after admitting he's been secretly married for 15 years.

[00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:57.440]
And another priest resigned when church leaders learned to use $225,000 of parish money to pay off a male lover.

[00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:09.880]
My sorrow is for my church, for the two priests themselves, for the people of the two parishes they have served, and for all the priests who will once again wonder if they too will be painted with a brush of infidelity.

[00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:15.120]
Bishop Robert Lynch said on Tuesday, Lynch announced both scandals after the Tampa Tribune reported Tuesday.

[00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:21.440]
The Reverend Patrick J. Clark of his spirit to Sanctu Catholic Church was married in 1981, but kept it a secret.

[00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:25.960]
Lynch recently received a copy of the marriage license in the mail.

[00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:35.400]
Lynch 52 admitted the marriage when confronted the bishop said Clark's suspension could be left that he could practice again as a priest if he decides the divorce his wife and don't spit in the bishop's push.

[00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:40.300]
Clark lived in the church rectumry as wife Barbara Stone, Roman, you're living in a separate home.

[00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:47.120]
The other priest, Reverend Simeon Gardner, was the pastor of St. Mary's parish in lutes, in lutes when he resigned.

[00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:55.300]
Oh, this is the best. Lynch said a member of the parish came to church leaders in mid-August with suspicions that money was being taken improperly.

[00:11:55.640 --> 00:12:02.380]
When officials confronted Gardner, he admitted he was using the money to pay another adult male with whom he had improper and impermissible sexual conduct.

[00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:06.800]
The church turned the matter over to state officials to consider possible criminal charges for stealing the money.

[00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:14.520]
This is a fact priest in lutes father old tool. God. Oh my God. Another isolated incident if there ever was one.

[00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:21.900]
10 13 at W I O D. How's Jeff Nudnick doing, by the way? Is he catching on or not? I don't think so.

[00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:29.860]
Talkin entertainment radio 16 W I O D 10 16 at W I D. I did mention that there's an exciting weekend coming up.

[00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:36.360]
We got the panthers starting with some of you won't see of course and we got Pompato Park opening for the fall meet on like tomorrow night. How you doing Gary Sibel?

[00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:45.620]
All right, Neil. How are you? Congratulations on your new endeavors here. The new general manager of Pompato Park, who's going to be wearing even more expensive suits now than ever in the past.

[00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:53.900]
Well, I'll have to buy a suit. Yeah. There you go. Yes, we are indeed opening up tomorrow night. We're looking forward to a real good opening.

[00:12:53.900 --> 00:13:04.900]
We have the October fest is part of our opening weekend festivities and it's going to be an awful lot of fun. Of course, the big thing we're all excited about is the beginning of card rooms on January 1st.

[00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:12.340]
Right. Beginning to get set up for that as well. We got free admission tomorrow night for everybody, which I did hear your spot by the way. I won't mention on Q.A.

[00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:17.160]
Am I heard that spot? And we also going to have a new track announcer. A lot of people are going to be upset.

[00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:24.680]
Gary isn't going to be announcing the races anymore. He's going to be going from table to table. Shmoosing and eating other people's food. But so who's going to be Connor races?

[00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:33.420]
A young man by the name of Steve Cross. He's from Saoada Downs, which as you know is also a five eighth smile track. He's familiar with a five eighth.

[00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:41.200]
I heard him up a couple weeks ago at the little brown jug calling races along with our favorite announcer Roger Houston.

[00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:45.480]
Have you had your if you were listening to Roger if you had your eardrums fixed yet?

[00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:56.720]
As a matter of fact, my right eardrum is still blown, but we're working on that now. Roger as a matter of fact had a really bad sore throat on the day before the jug on Wednesday.

[00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:04.100]
And told me the story how he went to the hospital that evening and had some kind of injections in his neck, but that's Roger telling the story.

[00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:13.600]
Yeah, right. So yeah, Steve's a good young guy calls a nice race has a good voice and hopefully he'll enjoy his stay down here in South Florida.

[00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:23.600]
Kind of ironic how this all turned out because you know if anybody had a crystal ball, somebody I know might have been a little bit more friendly and might have been a little bit more cooperative and might actually have wound up with that job.

[00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:30.860]
And they're all blasting up on the outside Jacky Mall in the gypsy's warrior out for the early lead.

[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:37.200]
Make that out in the middle of the race track. It's a slow Joe Dave. Yeah, well, whoever it is, Jack, whoever it might be, right?

[00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:47.340]
You do indeed know harness racing, though. I sure do. And when a guy calls horses go to the half mile pool six times in the same race, it must be a really long race. No wonder they're getting tired.

[00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:54.060]
Well, I was a kid growing up in New York. I used to listen to Jack Lee to give you some idea how old he might be when he was great. Right. When he was good.

[00:14:54.280 --> 00:15:03.720]
So anyway, setting him aside. If we can. So tomorrow night, we open at seven at seven thirty gates open at six. We got free admission for everybody in the first twenty five hundred people.

[00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:15.460]
Get what they get and I tell you what, I have my keys on it right now. This really nice key chain. It's heavy. I mean, this is a quality item here. And it's got the what will be the five dollar chip in

[00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:31.080]
a pompano parks card rooms. It really is a nice item. I mean, this is a nice giveaway and everybody will tour first twenty five hundred. You're going to get that tomorrow night. So good way to start out the season. I think. And the NL you won't no longer see any pompano pink around here as well.

[00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:38.660]
The place looks totally different. I hope you get here in the daylight where you can really get a view of what this place looks like.

[00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:47.080]
The track is not a magnificent job here fixing this place up. It is spotless from top to bottom. Great. And the dining room. Of course, we open a clubhouse.

[00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:53.820]
We'll be back open again for the fall meeting and we got all our guys coming back. Wally will be back. I'm sure and Joe Pavius here already. I guess.

[00:15:54.080 --> 00:16:04.280]
Yep. Joey's here. A lot of the guys are back rangers around. We have some new guys coming in. We have most of these guys are coming with between fifteen and twenty head, which is good.

[00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:10.860]
Rick Plano who's been racing at Vernon Downs in the state and Virgil Morgan Jr. a guy that races out in Ohio.

[00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:19.060]
And he had one of the heat winners in a little brown jug of horse by the name of Metropolis. Right. Vicki Howard is an owner of Bobby Inman's.

[00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:29.440]
The trainer they're coming from the meadows. Uh oh. Dean Collins. By the way, an Ohio horseman who at one time was the caretaker of Ramblin Willey.

[00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:37.140]
You remember the horse that God loved Bob Farrington. Uh it's right. Rick Hercules another guy coming and you're one of your favorite guys. Jeff Gregory is going to be back.

[00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:43.260]
All right. Oh, that's a man. Exactly. So it looks like Kevin Wallace will be back when Hazel Park closes in a couple of weeks.

[00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:51.140]
If he doesn't have too much money by that time boy. He is just I've been watching on the dish Hazel Park and he had five winners on Tuesday night.

[00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:57.860]
He didn't have any in the first six races five out of the last seven. He's breaking every record in history and he started there as you know because he was here late.

[00:16:57.860 --> 00:17:09.580]
He started a month late in the meeting and he's just a zillion wins ahead everybody. He really isn't. I've been looking at his stats up at Hazel Park this summer and he's driven not every race but pretty close to it at an incredible batting average.

[00:17:09.580 --> 00:17:18.080]
Yeah. So Kevin's coming back. All the main guys are coming back. We're looking forward to a great season. We have also increased the purses because the dark night

[00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:25.080]
is like a semi casting this summer has allowed us to do that. Yeah, we're done very well. Yeah, really did. I mean we have increases up to 29% in certain categories.

[00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:37.940]
17 five claimers are going for 29% more that pod is now up to $6,200. The 10 claimers going from 3,200 to 4,500. That's the 29% increase.

[00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:45.320]
So here's an across the board increase of about 20% right through. So beautiful. And that will go up throughout the season.

[00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:52.320]
Okay, looking forward to it. I'll see you tomorrow night. The fat man you can be sure will be the first one through the gates. So give the inspection and the certify everything is kosher.

[00:17:53.440 --> 00:18:01.860]
Well, no, have to go into the kitchen. I guess to check that there you know that's a no no for him for rich. No, no, no, no for the kitchen or the mutual.

[00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:07.900]
Yeah, kind of bad when he started to you know tasting the soup with a finger before everybody else got to that. I think that was the last straw.

[00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:14.180]
Well, we're ready for you or ready for wrench and everybody else that would love to come out tomorrow looking forward to seeing everybody.

[00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:21.120]
We'll be there. Thanks a lot, Gary. Take care. See you tomorrow night. Bye bye. Gary said well. The new general manager, a pomp and a park. Great guys been around for a long time.

[00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:28.720]
Here he's been a track announcer for many, many years. And now he you know, deservedly so gets bumped up to a higher post and we're going to have a really good meet.

[00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:36.460]
You can just feel it. You can smell it. It's going to be great. Okay, 7519 463 and day 524 W. I would be in proud. I got this TCI stuff.

[00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:42.320]
I want to get into a great life because I know as the moments draw closer to to to to to to to to Saturday night.

[00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:46.160]
And the Panther opener in Philadelphia, by the way, wait till you hear this.

[00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:52.620]
Wait till you hear this. Guess who's supposed to be who's invited himself on the show again tomorrow morning for two hours. Wait a minute.

[00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:59.960]
Wait a minute with the promise that he is grown. Okay, I know. I wish he could see the look on your face and the way you give me that.

[00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:08.400]
And I am just a skeptical if not more so than you are that he is growing up here is going to come in here and go ballistic until all of stories behind a story.

[00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:20.660]
And I don't even want to mention his name for fear of losing the audience. Here's a point in the cello. That was beautiful. Okay, whatever it was. It was beautiful. Here's yes. Hi. Yes. Hello, Neil.

[00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:25.640]
I thought that was on the phone. Yes. George is now doing just news drop-ins for Rimmer. Yes.

[00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:32.060]
I am just calling to say hello and good morning. I think you're the funniest man in the whole world. Yeah.

[00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:41.080]
This must be one of the coxist. And I got my men on 15 laps just right before that man called just now in that article you read.

[00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:51.720]
Yeah. I was laughing so hard I could not. Well, you really I peed my pants when I read it this morning. That way I had to put on plastic underwear just to keep reading it over and over again about Bob Green says this and Bob Green says that.

[00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:58.480]
And it's a very management intensive thing. We require a lot of attention, which is interesting because they're never here anyway. So what's all the attention?

[00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:07.140]
And then the one about the Cardinals or the whoever was so funny with you. How about how about the priest in lutes?

[00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:19.860]
The priest. Were all those Bible thumping Yahoo's are over there in lutes all those righteous Yahoo's. And here's a a a bag priest over there in lutes who's been ripping off the church so we could pay for his little whatever you had going on.

[00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:35.080]
So typical more isolated incidents, ma'am. Just remember that. Okay. No, I love you. So God bless you sweetheart and have a great day. And God bless you have no Nick too over there at the scum Sentinel. Okay, whatever his name is higher power.

[00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:42.800]
W. I. D. Ray. No, we're in business here to convert the world is what we're in business here for Jeff. We're here to say a prayer by Ruhatah or Nai Cox a hoist.

[00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:52.120]
Oh, I mean the stuff that you read in a course, it's so typical. It fits in like a rubber glove. It fits in beautifully too bad. The Yankees by the way pulled it out last night.

[00:20:52.280 --> 00:21:00.800]
Texas had a nice four to one leading that game. Did I tell you one Gonzalez is God. Boys, he good to tremendous home runs. One, it was just fair, but nonetheless it counts.

[00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:09.060]
And they had a four one lead. They blew it and lost it in 12 innings with a throwing year or five to four. But the Yankees are like they're on the ropes man. They're like hanging on by their toenails.

[00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:15.540]
And of course the Orioles like I told you and it's going to be interesting to see what happens today with the Alamo are thing because now he's dropped his appeal.

[00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:25.880]
And the union says Donald fear says the only thing we have to fear is me. He says that the suspension never would go out of the playoffs anyway.

[00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:29.960]
It would always have to be in a regular season. So there never was any chance of him sitting out the playoffs.

[00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:37.980]
And whether the umpires are going to sit still for this or not or wait till next to you the first five games. Who knows only the Lord knows and we don't know who he's betting on yet.

[00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:43.400]
1026 at W I O D talking entertainment radio.

[00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:52.920]
16 W I O D 1031 at W I O D God bless you children. We have very slow start here this morning on a phone. Looks like it's going to really be deadly.

[00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:59.400]
But then again I can take a lot of time and read all the memos there from TCI cable about how they really have your best interest at heart.

[00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:04.000]
Here's the Miami. Hello. New. Yes, sir. What's up? How you doing?

[00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:11.020]
I'm sorry game last night a replay on the dish. Yeah, I'm a double fan, but I'm fortunately here in Miami.

[00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:18.920]
Half a half. Yeah, I'm circumcised. Yeah, telling to put it away. Okay. Tell me to put it back in his pantaline.

[00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:25.280]
I saw a replay game with my friends on the D. I know was it was the Jersey and Detroit. It was the fact that you know,

[00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:29.420]
I'm a loser going like a mad dog. He's an animal. He's a jackass. Huh?

[00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:33.660]
Well, you're busted in and send everybody. Yeah. Hold on one second.

[00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:41.940]
Hello, me. Yes. That thing is unbelievable. What investment? I got the 18 inch last night. Yeah. In the dish too.

[00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:47.520]
Well, I don't know why people aren't out there buying them like crazy and I did hear more misinformation by the way this morning on QAM.

[00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:51.680]
Maybe if they talked to the guy from sports channel like we did yesterday instead of just sitting there and guessing,

[00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:56.880]
maybe they would know that yes, it is going to be on the small dish and they're praying that the first game will be on.

[00:22:57.100 --> 00:23:05.660]
And also they would know that at midnight Friday night, tomorrow night that all these cable companies like Continental and the Jones and some of these others will have the sports channel.

[00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:10.960]
Right. Other than TCI, which is busy screwing people. Yeah, we live down south and we've got a Delphiocable.

[00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:16.260]
Let me tell you something. That is the pits. They are the worst. The absolute worst. Yeah. But the reception is so clear.

[00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:24.060]
And I picked up the NHL center rice along with the other sports package that they offer for like 100 and pick it to 140.

[00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:31.180]
Right. All the regional sports channels are primed network and all the other ones. And it's a bargain. I'm telling you. From 100 bucks a year, you've got access to everything.

[00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:37.760]
Clarity is unbelievable. Took me a couple hours in the stall and we're home free. I'm great. That's the way to go.

[00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:43.620]
It's a baroque investment. I heard that the Sony is a lot faster than the RCA. I picked the Sony.

[00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:49.680]
A lot faster with what with the the brain like the actual receiver like you're changing from channel to channel.

[00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:59.620]
There's no like a lack. There's no. You know, you're. How long does it take it takes like a second? I don't know. I mean my the Sony's like super fast.

[00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:05.400]
Even if you input like 313 enter or whatever have you. I mean you're there. You don't have to press enter on a small dish.

[00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:09.440]
Period. No, you don't not on the RCA. Well, I've got the Sony.

[00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:14.700]
Well, like I said, so the so the extra time it takes for you to press the extra button is the only different.

[00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:17.440]
Well, you know, I'm glad you like what you got, but believe me that it's not a consideration.

[00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:25.840]
The RCA even the first generation, which is what I got. It changes one channel to next in a heartbeat in addition to which all of as you know,

[00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:34.340]
the hockey games are like all right next to each other. The baseball pack and the same with the football and all the sporting events so that you can just really go up and down and scan for

[00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:40.520]
to see what's going on all the different games or or punch in the number which everyone you want to do. But I mean it's that's not a consideration.

[00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:46.100]
Exactly. Well, we've been listening to you for years and you know, we finally get enough cash to buy it and for 400 bucks.

[00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:49.400]
It's a great investment. There you go. Neil, you got hang on a second. Yeah.

[00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:55.360]
A Neil. Yes, sir. One more thing. There's a room. We're going around in my gym. Yeah. That room is looking for steroids.

[00:24:55.920 --> 00:25:00.760]
Okay, but he could use him. He could use him. He could use him. Okay, get out of here.

[00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:07.040]
Okay, that was Denise Popman on the phone. We have really a wicked start here this morning. All the day lines are wide open.

[00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:14.740]
7519 463 to enbrouwered 524 W I O D to want to green lines. I get what is this going to be in every other day kind of a thing.

[00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:21.040]
Get used to it, man. Monday was great yesterday sensational Tuesday was a suicide inducing day. And I think today again,

[00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:26.200]
but hey, we just keep plotting right along as long as Jeff did that keeps putting my picture in the paper and stupid articles.

[00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:30.800]
We just keep plotting right along. Keep doing it, pal. Here's plantation. Hello.

[00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:37.800]
Good morning, Neil. How you doing? Okay. Listen, I was wondering when you were talking with the name Gary Cidell. Is it?

[00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:44.040]
Cidell, yes. What was he talking about? Card room. What does that have to do with on January 1st?

[00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:48.600]
Starting January 1st, there will be card rooms at Pompeydo Park for, you know, poker.

[00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:57.980]
For money, huh? Yeah. Oh, great. For money, right? And, um, uh, Kevin Wallace, he won't be there tomorrow, right?

[00:25:58.420 --> 00:26:03.560]
No, he will not. He's just still got a couple weeks to go at Hazel Park. Who's who's a who's a good jockey that will be there tomorrow?

[00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:08.380]
Good. Jockey. There will be no jockeys there. We have drivers there. We have any jockeys. Well, I don't know much about Hornets.

[00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:15.900]
Rally, Hennessy, Bruce Ranger, Joe Pavia. We got some outstanding drivers there. Okay. And, um, what's going to ask you?

[00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:24.380]
Um, yes. Do you think that the, um, the Panthers will try and pick up a score since the average is going to be out for two to three weeks?

[00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:31.720]
I don't hear anything about that. I haven't heard any indication that we are on the verge of getting anybody or that we're, I don't, I don't see it.

[00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:36.600]
Are you surprised that they didn't go go after anybody, a center or a winger during the off season?

[00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:42.080]
No, I'm not because they're, first of all, there wasn't that much available out there at a reasonable price that we're going to be willing to pay.

[00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:48.920]
And secondly, Brian Murray doesn't want to give up all these good young players we've got. Right. And what about, what about Primo? Did he stay with Detroit?

[00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:55.220]
The rumor is that he, the rumor I heard yesterday is that latest deal is Primo and Paul coffee to Hartford for Brendan Shanahan.

[00:26:56.380 --> 00:27:02.680]
Oh, right. But some of the Detroit players are a little nervous about having Brendan and Detroit because he just can't control a stick.

[00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:09.700]
Okay, pal. Have a great day. Okay. Okay. Look at this phone bank. Maybe we got the one mobile here and then we go to Louise. Hello, WYOD.

[00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:18.440]
Hey, Neil. How you doing? Okay, sir? How you feeling? I'm feeling great. Feeling great. Surprising. You would all the, you see the Malalukas kicking my butt.

[00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:25.700]
Yeah. You see him driving a nice 75. No, I did not. I don't have any Malalukas, man. They're like trapped them all down.

[00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:30.840]
No, it's terrible. Yeah. Terrible terrible thing. Anyway, I can't wait for hockey season to start.

[00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:34.940]
I'll put apart. Yeah, it's a good weekend. It could be great, great.

[00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:40.120]
I can see the excitement level here is phenomenal. I can see it right now. You can feel it. These people are like can't even control themselves.

[00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:48.420]
Yeah, but I got Jones. So I'll be able to watch it. Right? Sure. You got it. In fact, I got the memo right here from the Jones people that says one moment, please.

[00:27:49.380 --> 00:27:55.640]
Jones, Intercable and sports channel Florida and I was multi year carriage agreement and it says at midnight on Friday.

[00:27:57.220 --> 00:28:04.200]
Jones cable will click that baby on. Well, I'm going to stay up just to make sure there you go. It says, says Davey sister launched the service.

[00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:11.220]
October 5th at another words midnight for tomorrow night. Very good in play time for the game. Can I call somebody to back? Yes, sir?

[00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:18.800]
I tied your folks brain to back. Okay, have a good one and back to you. Okay, that clears out our busy board there. That's the end of this 1037.

[00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:25.080]
And that's the end of our show today. Like I said, I consider and read all the memos from TCI, which would kill some good time.

[00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:33.760]
But that's really not the purpose of the show 751 W I O D in day five, two, four, nine, four, six, three and Broward and one eight hundred nine, four, four, nine, four, six, three.

[00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:41.940]
You know, on Monday, I had this false sense of security that now that we had run and run on there in the morning, we were going to have this phenomenal lead in that there was going to be just this, this ongoing,

[00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:49.380]
continue weight. You know what I'm saying? This continuing thing where the phones were just going to be smoking and right into Rick and suds and right through the entire broadcast day.

[00:28:49.380 --> 00:29:02.980]
It would be like not having to jumpstart at any given point of the day. Right. Here's the purple line again. Hello. Hello. Nail. Yes, sir. Hey, Nail. How you doing? Okay. Well, first off, congratulations on the switch. Can't be anything, but positive.

[00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:10.920]
Well, if we had an audience that was awakened alive, that would really put me on top of the world, but we don't want to overdo it. We did too well yesterday, so we don't want to do two days in a row.

[00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:20.220]
I'm driving, but that doesn't particularly mean I'm awake or alive. Yeah, question about cigars. What's the right to correct humidity for for cigars?

[00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:28.080]
I haven't got any idea because I don't I don't have a human or an ordinary cigar freak. Now I'm just wondering with all the humidity down here, if it's even necessary.

[00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:35.780]
I would talk to if what's necessary to have a human or to keep them humidified. It is if you have AC because that D humidity. Yeah, that's right.

[00:29:35.780 --> 00:29:40.740]
Unless you're living outside, you got a problem. You know, if you're living outdoors, no problem at all. Okay.

[00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:47.620]
You're living under an overpass, but of course, you're living under an overpass, talking to your forwards of garrists. Well, you have a lot less overhead. That's true.

[00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:53.480]
All right. Who could I call 70 70 and 70? That's what somebody just called in for some puffer.

[00:29:54.260 --> 00:29:58.580]
Professional puffer. That's what I needed to know. Okay, pal. Thanks a lot. Best of luck. Okay. Blow some good ones.

[00:29:58.580 --> 00:30:07.320]
Okay, we have two open lines in day. It's 7519463. One on a purple line, pound IOD 2 and Broward 17 on the green lines, etc, etc, etc, etc, etc, etc.

[00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:16.320]
Unbelievable. So like I said, I sure like that Roberto Alamar. And it's interesting last night when they did have Donald Fira on the Yankee Ranger game.

[00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:23.340]
It's interesting that on the one hand, Tom Watts's name, Brennan was talking the one side of the story about how it was inexcusable.

[00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:30.500]
What he did and people were a gas and a gasp and a gap. But on the other hand, the other guy who was with Brennan, who I have no idea who he wasn't really blows.

[00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:37.840]
But he made a good point to Donald Fira too about the baiting by the umpires. They addressed that issue. And the fact that it's been going on for years and something needs to be done about it.

[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:43.600]
And that's definitely got to be addressed. So we're not saying nobody here has said that Alamar was right to spit in anybody's face.

[00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:49.240]
But on the other hand, what started it, baby? And they keep showing at replay over and over and over again.

[00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:56.760]
F you, F you, F you, F you, F you. There it is. You can't say it, but boy, if you got to be duff, duff, dumb and blind, not to see what they'll or say.

[00:30:58.140 --> 00:31:04.040]
Back and forth, F you, I feel too. F you. Great. There's good family entertainment that all the kids can enjoy.

[00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:06.840]
Here's a lady mobile and bokeh. Hello.

[00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:10.060]
I am a living, breathing and female while hallelujah.

[00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:17.780]
I don't mean to reiterate the paper. I just started listening to you. But always a point of the article today in the lifestyle section of sunset.

[00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:25.440]
I haven't got any idea. You know, I made reference to it. You and I must be the only ones who sought because nobody else got anything out of it or has anything to say about it as usual.

[00:31:25.940 --> 00:31:33.000]
I think the essence is that Jeff Nudden who writes this column just can't believe that Bud Paxen is letting us do our things.

[00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:41.820]
Yeah. I think a lot of these people were sitting back waiting to rub their hands in glee and expecting them to clamp down on us and stop us from doing our act, which was never the intent from the beginning.

[00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:51.160]
I didn't find it funny. How they're going to change the number to whatever W W God or whatever that it's right WG O D right.

[00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:59.700]
That was really funny or to Neil. Yeah. That would be good. Yeah. That was really funny. And then did you believe in the lifestyle section on the front page that left column?

[00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:07.700]
I would forget that guy's name. I think he's not one of your favorites. Ray wretched. Yeah. Yeah. He wrote about the situation between Al Mar.

[00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:13.620]
Yeah. I'm glad you brought that up because I forgot about him, which is easy to do. He wrote a really stupid as usual in sip and column.

[00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:23.100]
And the essence of it is that our kids. I thought he had a point though. I really did. What's that? Well, here's this girl who's 10 years old. Doesn't he or he years old. Doesn't even take the stupid pills.

[00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:33.080]
No, no, I'm not talking about that part. I'm talking about what you're referring to the part about the the Alamar incident. And he says, and here kids are seeing all these people cheering a guy who's bitten somebody's face. What's the message?

[00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:41.920]
I think in that case, the message is that they respect this guy that they like him a lot. And the fact is that they before they were booing and curing him in the batting practice.

[00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:50.220]
So a lot of people did boo him, but you don't hold something like that against someone for the rest of their lives. And you don't condemn them. And you don't, you know, everybody can lose control. Everybody can make a mistake.

[00:32:50.220 --> 00:33:00.820]
He didn't steal or freight train. He didn't hit anybody. He didn't kill anybody and life goes on. Exactly. But the point what I was just trying to say is that the girl gets a 10 days suspension and he gets a five.

[00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:13.200]
Yeah. So I mean, you know, what I don't know how about Michael Irvin. He's coming back this week. I mean, all he was doing was screwing around with a bunch of hookers and doing cocaine and stuff like that.

[00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:24.040]
He got five games. And of course football. They don't play as many games so people would say, well, that's pretty pretty stiff penalty. What kind of a penalty is that for a guy who was in all the crap that he was? And the fans will cheer him and life will go on.

[00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:35.220]
That's exactly right. And Albert Bell. Same way. Right. Exactly. So I guess we because Bobby Alamara lost control for a couple of seconds there for whatever reason and did something that's totally inexcusable.

[00:33:35.420 --> 00:33:40.900]
Therefore, he's in the same category with these other people with guys who are doing dope and screwing around on their wives. Hallelujah.

[00:33:41.620 --> 00:33:44.920]
And do you happen to see them? I think they really ought to show it a few more times.

[00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:55.520]
Yeah. You see the Michael Jordan interview last night. I saw about two minutes of it. I made the mistake as I was scanning through of dropping areas. His head is so shiny that it was blinded by the light.

[00:33:55.980 --> 00:34:08.800]
And the earring was big enough to hang most people's laundry on. So yeah, I saw it second or two of it. And then he was on there. I'm king plugging his perfume line. Here's the guy that's his cologne line. He's making $25 million for playing basketball.

[00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:20.340]
And now he's out there with a line of cologne for men. Smell just like me. My friend is a corporate attorney in Chicago and he represents a law firm that handles a lot of his cases.

[00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:33.980]
Yeah. But apparently he's got like this king thrown chair in his boardroom. And he'll come in there and put pants and not shirt on. And he's known to barely be closed during a lot of these meetings.

[00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:42.900]
He's like King Thompson and a chair. Hallelujah. I'm going to bow down in the rubber's ball spots if I get $5 million. Have a great taste. Bye. Bye.

[00:34:44.060 --> 00:34:54.300]
Open line and date 751. Oh, there's Brendan Shanahan there on the ice. What are they talking about here? Did we make the deal yet or not? There's Shanahan with Hartford on the ESPN. Well, we don't know what's going on because we don't have the audio up.

[00:34:54.300 --> 00:35:23.740]
Anyway, two open lines in Broward 5249463. Here's Miami. Hello. Miami. How you doing? Okay, sir? I have a David Lashers by report. I don't know if anybody's reported it. He's on another show now. He's on what show? It's clueless. The show of the movie. Yeah, on Fridays at 9 o'clock. Okay. No, just just you know that he's not on. You can't watch him on blossom. And now you can watch him on another show. Is he naked? No. He plays like a high school kid. So how was it? Okay, pal.

[00:35:23.740 --> 00:35:40.520]
That's a good news. Okay, we get all the good stuff for you here. Two open lines in day 751 to in Broward 524. I guess nobody else out there cares about the TCI thing. Nobody is interested in that. And the interesting part of their memos, which may or may not be accurate, but it says they're getting 30 to 33 calls a day.

[00:35:41.380 --> 00:35:55.620]
So if allegedly there are all these Panther fans and all these cable subscribers and they've got two to 300,000 subscribers in day to Broward locked in there with TCI. If the real are all these people who are pissed off, I'll tell you one thing. You're sure as hell not calling them 1045 at WIOD.

[00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:15.520]
Unbelabeled.

[00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:50.480]
Say goodbye to Aaron someers say hi to Ron and Ron. They're gonna work for taxes. Are you?

[00:36:50.660 --> 00:36:59.480]
And that's a matter of facts. They're gonna work for taxes. Are you sure? But Neil ain't changing his act.

[00:37:01.660 --> 00:37:04.020]
Taxes and upon again Christian.

[00:37:04.780 --> 00:37:10.360]
Oh, he wants to change the stations.

[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:15.640]
Letters. The WGOT now will work for taxes.

[00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:16.560]
They're good.

[00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:18.100]
Taxes he's the plan.

[00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:19.900]
Taxes.

[00:37:20.220 --> 00:37:22.300]
Taxes he's gone on work for taxes.

[00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:23.240]
Taxes.

[00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:25.600]
Taxes he'll make the sign of the cross.

[00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:36.080]
So listen to your about that priest in lutes. It's 1048 at WIOD. We got a couple of open hearts.

[00:37:36.380 --> 00:37:41.640]
Indeed. 7519463 751 WIOD.

[00:37:41.940 --> 00:37:48.760]
Baby, it's gonna be great. It's gonna be sensational when we get in that new studio. The audience will still be a bunch of stiffs, but we're gonna be having a great time.

[00:37:49.820 --> 00:37:53.120]
Here's a mobile in what? How the hell can that be? In Coco Beach? Hello?

[00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:56.960]
Come on. You're slapping my thigh.

[00:37:57.300 --> 00:38:01.480]
I just left Coco Beach and the holiday in, man. You were coming in loud and clear.

[00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:04.580]
They must have cranked that thing up to at least 50 watts now.

[00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:06.320]
It works. It's better than QAM.

[00:38:06.580 --> 00:38:08.660]
Beautiful. This way till we get our new transmitter.

[00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:09.980]
Another one.

[00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:14.800]
Hey, now the alarm of the situation in the urban situation is you're right. They're not the same.

[00:38:14.860 --> 00:38:16.300]
Irving should have been thrown out of a league.

[00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:16.640]
Right.

[00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:22.020]
And he got five games and I'll say it again. Baseball is 162 and football is only 16.

[00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:26.400]
So there is a difference there, but nevertheless, I mean five games is five games.

[00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:28.480]
And how do you make a comparison between it two?

[00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:35.200]
Guy lost his temper during the heat of an argument, spitting a guy's face, inexcusable, unacceptable, but it wasn't like the end of the world.

[00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:41.820]
And as other guys out there doing just grotesque things, cheating on his wife, screwing around, doing cocaine, and he gets five games.

[00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:44.080]
And now I bring them back and let's arm with the game.

[00:38:44.300 --> 00:38:45.240]
He should have been taught.

[00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:48.500]
Amen. Amen.

[00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:50.520]
Okay, pal. Have a great life.

[00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:53.060]
Shoot him and come, but he'll be back this weekend.

[00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:56.380]
I guarantee you when he comes out there, those Dallas fans, man, they'll be cheering.

[00:38:56.380 --> 00:38:58.440]
I don't know who they're playing or where they're playing. It's coming weekend.

[00:38:58.820 --> 00:39:00.440]
But where if it is, I hope they lose their ass.

[00:39:00.700 --> 00:39:03.780]
They just barely wriggle off against the hobbling eagles the other night.

[00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:05.740]
So I have a feeling that they could be right for it.

[00:39:05.820 --> 00:39:08.820]
And I didn't hear skip bailiffs with Ron and Ron yesterday. I wish I would have heard it.

[00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:09.960]
Evidently, it was on early.

[00:39:10.820 --> 00:39:16.740]
But from what he had to say about Barry Swisher, he's not exactly what people think he might be other than a sleaze bag.

[00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:21.480]
And I don't think we heard too much about Troy Ekman and his boyfriends, but that may be coming next time.

[00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:22.300]
Or maybe they will be.

[00:39:23.180 --> 00:39:24.420]
Here's Miami. Hello.

[00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:26.140]
Miami.

[00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:28.320]
Hello.

[00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:29.260]
Yes.

[00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:30.400]
Uncle Neil.

[00:39:30.660 --> 00:39:31.660]
Yes. How are you?

[00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:32.140]
Okay.

[00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:34.860]
Listen, I've been listening to you for about 15 years now.

[00:39:35.060 --> 00:39:35.280]
Yes.

[00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:40.800]
And I'm from Detroit and I have some friends of mine that know Dick Perkins as he knows you real well.

[00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:41.800]
Yes. He does.

[00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:45.380]
And I was out to dinner the other night with some friends.

[00:39:45.380 --> 00:39:45.960]
I know, Dick.

[00:39:46.260 --> 00:39:48.240]
You know, Dick, he used to work with you, didn't he?

[00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:49.140]
He did.

[00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:50.260]
And I was a lot of...

[00:39:50.260 --> 00:39:52.080]
Whatever you say, I mean, I'll just go along with what you say.

[00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:53.980]
Okay. Well, anyway, I was out to dinner.

[00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:56.620]
I was out to dinner the other night with a bunch of my friends.

[00:39:56.800 --> 00:39:59.380]
You know, I was telling them, you know, I've been listening to you for about 15 years.

[00:39:59.420 --> 00:39:59.580]
Yeah.

[00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:00.480]
You can tell I might come down here.

[00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:00.880]
Right.

[00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:05.260]
And these guys are telling me he says, you know, he says that boy nearly says, you know,

[00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:07.260]
he's been taking in the ass for 40 years now.

[00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:09.180]
And I'm just wondering if there's any truth to this.

[00:40:09.220 --> 00:40:09.640]
That's cute.

[00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:10.780]
Is it cute?

[00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:11.540]
That's really cute.

[00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:12.640]
What is there any truth to it?

[00:40:12.740 --> 00:40:12.900]
No.

[00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:15.200]
No, I don't think Dick has either.

[00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:15.920]
You don't think?

[00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:16.680]
How about you, have you?

[00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:17.860]
No, I don't.

[00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:20.640]
You sound like you just not with that scratchy voice like you may not make the new year.

[00:40:20.860 --> 00:40:22.460]
No, I just woke up right now.

[00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:24.080]
Yeah, evidently on the right side of bed.

[00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:24.540]
No, no.

[00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:24.720]
Okay, pal.

[00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:25.360]
Alright.

[00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:26.480]
Don't drop the vacillant.

[00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:29.520]
We have an open line in day, at 7519, for the...

[00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:30.580]
You know who that must be?

[00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:34.340]
That must be that same asshole from Detroit that got the bug up his ass about Kevin Wallas.

[00:40:34.340 --> 00:40:36.360]
That's what got him started today.

[00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:37.440]
That's the guy.

[00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:40.400]
That's the guy that Kevin Wallas had her.

[00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:40.920]
Guess what?

[00:40:41.060 --> 00:40:42.620]
Kevin didn't get in any trouble in Windsor.

[00:40:42.860 --> 00:40:43.900]
Kevin isn't being suspended.

[00:40:44.260 --> 00:40:45.560]
Kevin is winning races like Crazy.

[00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:48.500]
One five more at Hazel Park Tuesday, which I've seen myself on the satellite.

[00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:51.320]
And he's going to be down here and probably lead all the drivers again.

[00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:53.040]
Which we just love, okay?

[00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:55.300]
So look out for your own record.

[00:40:55.460 --> 00:40:56.620]
And don't worry about mine, okay?

[00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:57.920]
Everything's just fine.

[00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:00.540]
Two open lines on the green lines.

[00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:02.340]
1-800-944-9463.

[00:41:02.340 --> 00:41:05.360]
A little slow, and of course you sounded like scratchier than usual.

[00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:07.880]
And doesn't sound like he's going to be around too much longer.

[00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:08.580]
Damn it.

[00:41:09.340 --> 00:41:10.760]
Here's a Davy on a purple line.

[00:41:10.820 --> 00:41:11.000]
Hello?

[00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:11.700]
Neil God.

[00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:12.240]
Yes, sir.

[00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:13.120]
Hey, check this out.

[00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:15.800]
I'm sure you heard about this quote out of the scum sentinel.

[00:41:15.900 --> 00:41:16.080]
Yeah.

[00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:16.980]
Are Mickey Harrison?

[00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:18.280]
No, I did not hear it.

[00:41:18.580 --> 00:41:20.260]
Okay, here's what it says.

[00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:23.540]
I really would have no choice to...

[00:41:23.540 --> 00:41:24.480]
He's moving out.

[00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:25.740]
He's leaving us.

[00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:26.840]
He's leaving the other thread.

[00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:31.820]
And if the Miami Arena continues to be controlled by Heising and Management Company,

[00:41:31.820 --> 00:41:33.820]
I have no choice to sell or move teams.

[00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:34.200]
Right.

[00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:37.120]
He said that he's been saying that all along.

[00:41:37.420 --> 00:41:38.400]
This is the new deal.

[00:41:38.420 --> 00:41:40.940]
He's making the big threats and either you're going to vote for the thing,

[00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:41.920]
or I'm moving.

[00:41:42.220 --> 00:41:45.400]
Thank God Wayne never, you know, yanked a survive like that or lied about them.

[00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:47.800]
I'm glad when you're going to tell you something right now and you can mark it down.

[00:41:48.220 --> 00:41:51.520]
If Howard Coney would change their mind and decide they wanted to build this facility,

[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:53.120]
I will not play here.

[00:41:53.260 --> 00:41:56.380]
Say, thank God that Wayne is a man of his word and you never change his mind

[00:41:56.380 --> 00:41:57.920]
and the yanked a survive to make threats.

[00:41:58.120 --> 00:41:58.600]
Another thing.

[00:41:58.920 --> 00:41:59.280]
TCI.

[00:41:59.600 --> 00:41:59.760]
Yeah.

[00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:00.440]
Call them.

[00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:01.480]
Same thing.

[00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:02.780]
Go get the little dish.

[00:42:03.420 --> 00:42:04.140]
You know something?

[00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:05.200]
Oh, they really told you that?

[00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:05.820]
They told me that.

[00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:06.520]
That's very nice.

[00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:07.400]
Go get the look.

[00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:08.580]
I said, what do I have to do?

[00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:09.120]
Get a dish.

[00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:11.760]
And the lady says, well, the little dish has it.

[00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:13.800]
I said, three, you telling me to go get it?

[00:42:13.980 --> 00:42:15.220]
She said, well, we're not going to have it.

[00:42:15.660 --> 00:42:17.120]
Oh, she said, we're not going to have it?

[00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:17.440]
Yeah.

[00:42:17.820 --> 00:42:18.740]
Ha ha ha ha.

[00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:20.080]
All right.

[00:42:20.220 --> 00:42:21.420]
Let's hear it for TCI.

[00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:25.720]
Oh, I got this memo again right in front of me that says they're so concerned about

[00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:26.580]
public relations.

[00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:30.880]
It says, although customer animosity may get worse before it gets better as the season

[00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:35.120]
begins and we still have no agreement, please continue to put the customer first philosophy

[00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:38.520]
to work and letting the customer know that we're trying to bring the service to the customers

[00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:41.580]
who want it without having to require those who don't want it to pay for it.

[00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:41.920]
Yeah.

[00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:42.300]
Yeah.

[00:42:42.620 --> 00:42:43.580]
Customers first, right?

[00:42:43.860 --> 00:42:43.860]

[00:42:43.980 --> 00:42:44.840]
Go buy a dish.

[00:42:45.100 --> 00:42:45.780]
I love it.

[00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:46.500]
You got to love it.

[00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:47.760]
Hey, remember, I got a bag of it.

[00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:48.620]
And don't bother Ross.

[00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:50.900]
Just go buy a dish because we can't do it for you.

[00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:51.760]
Unbelievable.

[00:42:52.340 --> 00:42:55.400]
I remember back a month ago, you said that you had a Mickey Ererson.

[00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:56.460]
And asshole song.

[00:42:56.500 --> 00:42:56.780]
Yeah.

[00:42:56.780 --> 00:42:57.700]
You wouldn't let you play it.

[00:42:57.960 --> 00:42:58.360]
Oh, yeah.

[00:42:58.440 --> 00:42:59.560]
Do we still have that, George?

[00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:00.920]
Can you play that on the news nuggets?

[00:43:01.460 --> 00:43:02.480]
Oh, it's going to be on Niels nuggets.

[00:43:02.620 --> 00:43:04.020]
November 1st went at the stuff.

[00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:04.600]
Oh, it's filthy.

[00:43:04.660 --> 00:43:05.060]
That's right.

[00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:06.000]
We're not going to put it on here.

[00:43:06.060 --> 00:43:06.780]
Oh, you can't play that.

[00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:07.920]
But it'll be on the CD.

[00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:08.760]
You can go out and buy it.

[00:43:08.780 --> 00:43:09.280]
On your nuggets.

[00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:10.480]
It'll be on my nuggets.

[00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:11.120]
Oh, man.

[00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:12.560]
And that last guy too, if he's got any.

[00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:14.940]
We'll find out if rumors got any tomorrow.

[00:43:15.140 --> 00:43:16.400]
This is going to be a pretty exciting.

[00:43:16.540 --> 00:43:17.560]
Remember, go get some nuggets.

[00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:18.540]
Yeah, go grow up here.

[00:43:18.580 --> 00:43:19.420]
I'm chicken McNugget.

[00:43:19.420 --> 00:43:19.700]
Okay.

[00:43:19.900 --> 00:43:20.220]
See you.

[00:43:21.180 --> 00:43:21.620]
That's right.

[00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:22.620]
It's not that far away today.

[00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:23.220]
It is October turd.

[00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:25.300]
And come on November 1.

[00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:26.080]
Less than a month away.

[00:43:26.100 --> 00:43:28.380]
We'll have all our CDs and cassettes out for center one.

[00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:31.380]
And the best news is, at least the best news to me since he was nice

[00:43:31.380 --> 00:43:32.240]
enough to do it for us.

[00:43:32.700 --> 00:43:34.680]
Phil Henry put a whole bunch of stuff together.

[00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:37.300]
He and Andy compiled another best of Phil thing.

[00:43:37.660 --> 00:43:39.160]
And now the fact that he's not here anymore.

[00:43:39.260 --> 00:43:42.380]
The only way you're going to hear is a lot of Phil Henry great stuff is to buy that CD.

[00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:43.720]
Come November 1.

[00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:45.540]
So I think that's probably going to be the big best seller.

[00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:46.960]
We got another best of Niels.

[00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:48.940]
That's the best one ever got great stuff on it.

[00:43:48.940 --> 00:43:50.100]
And we also got Niels nuggets.

[00:43:50.100 --> 00:43:52.680]
Which has stuff that we can't play on the air.

[00:43:52.740 --> 00:43:55.700]
It's got stuff that we're tired of playing on the air like the bridge tender.

[00:43:56.060 --> 00:43:58.680]
And Jack in a box in that crap.

[00:43:59.100 --> 00:43:59.500]
Crap.

[00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:00.080]
Crap.

[00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:00.380]
Crap.

[00:44:00.380 --> 00:44:01.000]
The Crap.

[00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:01.600]
The Crap.

[00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:02.960]
On sensor is on there.

[00:44:03.220 --> 00:44:04.040]
You might even hear a little.

[00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:04.720]
Or two.

[00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:07.820]

Sister Squeeze Hill and the Farrah Park.

[00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:05.960]
We can't forget the people.

[00:45:06.740 --> 00:45:08.600]
Though we try to hide them.

[00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:10.280]
And forget we knew them.

[00:45:10.580 --> 00:45:13.020]
They used to work beside us.

[00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:16.820]
Even though this time they made us lose our minds.

[00:45:16.820 --> 00:45:21.380]
And we barrel with Alprent and Dean Gary Bruce Jeff Clark.

[00:45:21.380 --> 00:45:23.760]
Johnny Darken Joseph Gackie.

[00:45:23.780 --> 00:45:24.000]
Oh!

[00:45:24.260 --> 00:45:24.400]
Hey!

[00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:27.240]
Goldberg McGreen, Marvin Roman Warming.

[00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:29.860]
We're definitely Lewis Quinn and we're just going to forget.

[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:33.040]
We are all the people.

[00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:35.500]
Who are still here working.

[00:45:35.940 --> 00:45:37.160]
And Neil still working.

[00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:39.740]
We are all the people.

[00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:43.980]
Who are out there giving just a major living.

[00:45:45.380 --> 00:45:47.420]
I would like to exterminate rabbits.

[00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:49.780]
What's up, Doc?

[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:57.540]
And we're out there giving just a major living.

[00:45:58.080 --> 00:45:59.160]
We are all...

[00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:01.740]
This is Fred Rogers of Mr. Rogers' neighborhood.

[00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:02.720]
Not so loud, Fred.

[00:46:02.780 --> 00:46:04.160]
You might wake the kids up, cut the crap.

[00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:06.440]
Love it a clock right on the Schneider on WIOD.

[00:46:06.460 --> 00:46:08.100]
Look at this. This is just beautiful.

[00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:11.000]
I noticed by the way that maybe the audience is just oblivious.

[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:12.380]
We haven't had anybody calling yet.

[00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:13.940]
Not even any old Yent is saying,

[00:46:13.940 --> 00:46:15.840]
Oh, gee, where's the news?

[00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:17.500]
We'd like to know what's going on.

[00:46:17.700 --> 00:46:17.980]
Nobody.

[00:46:18.180 --> 00:46:20.780]
I mean, how often can you repeat the same stupid news anyway?

[00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:21.700]
We know what's going on.

[00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:23.820]
We know all the crap out there that's going on.

[00:46:23.820 --> 00:46:24.700]
Enough is enough already.

[00:46:24.760 --> 00:46:25.780]
We know that same stupid news.

[00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:31.160]
And so what kind of loosens it up a little bit and gives us more time to sit here and beg for phone calls and have a great time.

[00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:31.820]
And we're loving it.

[00:46:32.780 --> 00:46:33.660]
Here's a plantation.

[00:46:34.060 --> 00:46:34.340]
Hello.

[00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:35.040]
Hello.

[00:46:35.260 --> 00:46:35.600]
Yes, sir.

[00:46:35.720 --> 00:46:36.280]
Neil God.

[00:46:36.500 --> 00:46:37.080]
Yes, I am.

[00:46:37.080 --> 00:46:39.000]
What's with these journalists, man?

[00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:39.720]
You're analysts?

[00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:41.120]
Yeah, right.

[00:46:41.660 --> 00:46:46.980]
Why can't they just see that you guys are with the people who are here.

[00:46:47.480 --> 00:46:47.620]
Right.

[00:46:47.860 --> 00:46:50.760]
I mean, nothing's going to stop.

[00:46:51.100 --> 00:46:54.420]
Well, they're trying to make a story out of something that doesn't exist.

[00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:55.820]
In other words, they're looking for a hook.

[00:46:56.040 --> 00:46:58.160]
They're trying to say, oh, a lot of, you know, Paxton's born again.

[00:46:58.480 --> 00:47:02.160]
And there was all the speculation, mostly by them anyway, that once he took over.

[00:47:02.300 --> 00:47:05.520]
I mean, does anybody really think that any of us would have stayed here?

[00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:09.380]
If we were going to have to sit here and like read from the Bible on here every day, what were they thinking about?

[00:47:09.700 --> 00:47:10.320]
I don't know.

[00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:11.300]
What are they thinking about?

[00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:13.500]
We're going to turn this into a religious station.

[00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:17.900]
Isn't there more better stuff to write about or make stories about?

[00:47:18.060 --> 00:47:18.580]
Evidently not.

[00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:20.220]
I thought you were going to say better stuff, yeah.

[00:47:20.280 --> 00:47:21.180]
Yeah, almost.

[00:47:21.780 --> 00:47:22.400]
Well, close.

[00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:23.220]
I don't blame you.

[00:47:23.380 --> 00:47:25.740]
I think, well, I think they are writing about what you almost said.

[00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:26.520]
Yeah.

[00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:27.300]
A lot of shots.

[00:47:27.820 --> 00:47:27.820]

[00:47:28.340 --> 00:47:29.980]
I have a question for you.

[00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:35.160]
I did you like the quotes from Bob Green though about how, you know, we have a lot of heavy management has to be involved.

[00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:35.580]
Yeah.

[00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:38.820]
And we might take Paxon on a ride of his life for good or for worse.

[00:47:38.860 --> 00:47:39.380]
Yeah, right.

[00:47:39.560 --> 00:47:39.920]
Yeah, right.

[00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:40.020]
Yeah, right.

[00:47:40.140 --> 00:47:40.400]
Right.

[00:47:41.960 --> 00:47:42.680]
But anyway.

[00:47:42.860 --> 00:47:49.720]
But anyway, I got to say, I was wondering about Jesus.

[00:47:50.580 --> 00:47:51.220]
What do I like?

[00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:52.040]
So, yeah.

[00:47:52.220 --> 00:47:53.760]
What exactly, I mean, what was the story?

[00:47:53.860 --> 00:47:54.820]
He just went with the package.

[00:47:55.020 --> 00:47:55.760]
I never got the before.

[00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:56.580]
You know something.

[00:47:56.800 --> 00:48:02.180]
If I could tell you 100% positively sure, I'd be the first one to tell you.

[00:48:02.180 --> 00:48:03.820]
I mean, everybody's got a different opinion.

[00:48:04.300 --> 00:48:07.260]
I don't think in this case that what you see is what you get.

[00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:14.480]
I think that for whatever reason the Paxon people didn't take Phil's contract that they didn't take him on here.

[00:48:15.180 --> 00:48:17.120]
That's the only thing that we can gather.

[00:48:17.820 --> 00:48:23.160]
And at the Cox people said, well, let's hang on to him because he's a good talent and we'll find him a thing somewhere in the organization.

[00:48:23.540 --> 00:48:26.180]
And they had an opening out of KFI and LA and they put him on out there.

[00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:28.160]
And that's the best I can determine.

[00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:28.720]
Okay.

[00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:35.460]
Because you see way back in May when the announcement was made to the radio station when Paxon had the press conference,

[00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:40.820]
one of the first things he announced was that Aaron Summers wasn't going to be with us and Phil Henry wasn't going to be with us.

[00:48:40.820 --> 00:48:42.880]
Which at the time, I thought, oh, it's you, why are they doing this?

[00:48:42.940 --> 00:48:46.840]
Because now Phil's going to be a lame duck for four months and it's going to be really rough and it was.

[00:48:47.340 --> 00:48:47.440]
Yeah.

[00:48:47.460 --> 00:48:52.240]
So obviously at that time they wanted everybody to know for whatever reason that he was not going to be here.

[00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:53.580]
I can't understand that.

[00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:55.700]
That seems like a really good one.

[00:48:55.700 --> 00:49:00.860]
Not unless we can not unless we can see Brian Cox's fine hands somewhere in the middle of that, that hold often thing.

[00:49:01.400 --> 00:49:02.280]
Yeah, I'm serious.

[00:49:03.080 --> 00:49:04.840]
Well, one more question.

[00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:05.240]
Yes, sir.

[00:49:07.380 --> 00:49:08.180]
Uh, cheese.

[00:49:08.980 --> 00:49:10.180]
Keep coming back to him again.

[00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:10.900]
Yeah, right.

[00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:11.860]
Okay, pal.

[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:12.300]
All right.

[00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:12.840]
Have a great day.

[00:49:13.040 --> 00:49:14.960]
Okay. Maybe he'll tell you the answer.

[00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:22.140]
We have an open line at Broward 5249463524WID and a big pair in Broward and in the green line, whatever the place is.

[00:49:22.140 --> 00:49:23.500]
So what's the story on this?

[00:49:23.620 --> 00:49:25.140]
So were you telling me or were Steve telling me?

[00:49:25.660 --> 00:49:27.900]
Steve Nichol was telling me about the phone set up over there.

[00:49:28.260 --> 00:49:29.700]
We still have the purple line.

[00:49:29.840 --> 00:49:33.120]
We still have our three day three Broward and we still have 800 to the line.

[00:49:34.540 --> 00:49:37.280]
So all about we've been threatening Palm Beach that they might get cut off.

[00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:37.900]
They knew better.

[00:49:38.020 --> 00:49:38.940]
We couldn't cut them off.

[00:49:38.940 --> 00:49:40.140]
I mean, just for Paul Harvey Jr.

[00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:41.420]
You marked my words.

[00:49:41.420 --> 00:49:42.500]
He'll be on there in a heartbeat.

[00:49:43.100 --> 00:49:44.060]
75 what is it?

[00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:48.840]
1 800 94494631800 Paul Harvey Jr. God.

[00:49:49.880 --> 00:49:50.500]
Here's Hollywood.

[00:49:50.820 --> 00:49:51.120]
Hello.

[00:49:51.780 --> 00:49:52.280]
Neil God.

[00:49:52.280 --> 00:49:52.580]
Yes, sir.

[00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:53.340]
Oh, yeah.

[00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:53.760]
Okay.

[00:49:54.100 --> 00:49:54.380]
Good.

[00:49:54.540 --> 00:49:57.100]
Hey, I'm going to miss that Neil God off your CD.

[00:49:57.500 --> 00:49:57.800]
Yeah.

[00:49:58.620 --> 00:49:59.880]
What do you call it that bit?

[00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:00.860]
You're not going to miss it.

[00:50:00.860 --> 00:50:02.580]
We're just put a little bleep in there every now and then.

[00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:03.620]
So when we get psychotic.

[00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:04.660]
Oh, I like that.

[00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:04.980]
Yeah.

[00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:05.540]
I really did.

[00:50:05.820 --> 00:50:08.700]
Hey, listen the other day when Brian Norkross called in.

[00:50:08.740 --> 00:50:10.280]
I was talking to Rick and Sud.

[00:50:10.420 --> 00:50:10.560]
Yes.

[00:50:10.780 --> 00:50:11.100]
It's it.

[00:50:11.460 --> 00:50:13.660]
I heard Todd Tungan calling yesterday.

[00:50:13.860 --> 00:50:16.360]
I guess all the lightweight weather guys are calling Rick and Suds now.

[00:50:16.820 --> 00:50:20.560]
And I heard Todd telling Rick that Brian's the one to set up down here in Key West.

[00:50:20.560 --> 00:50:22.340]
He said he's got a real in there, so to speak.

[00:50:22.500 --> 00:50:23.220]
Well, someone called it.

[00:50:23.380 --> 00:50:23.860]
Whatever that means.

[00:50:24.020 --> 00:50:26.740]
Someone called you up and said he was in real tight down here in Key West.

[00:50:27.120 --> 00:50:27.480]
Yeah.

[00:50:27.480 --> 00:50:28.040]
And he got him in.

[00:50:28.220 --> 00:50:28.460]
I hear.

[00:50:28.700 --> 00:50:28.860]
Yeah.

[00:50:30.300 --> 00:50:31.620]
But someone called you.

[00:50:31.720 --> 00:50:33.320]
I believe in said that he said the afterward.

[00:50:33.900 --> 00:50:34.260]
Yeah.

[00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:39.540]
And what he said is he said, I hate to call up and mock up MUCK your afternoon.

[00:50:40.380 --> 00:50:41.480]
Oh, my God.

[00:50:43.300 --> 00:50:44.680]
He hates to call and mock.

[00:50:45.100 --> 00:50:45.880]
That's what he said.

[00:50:46.780 --> 00:50:47.000]
Unbelievable.

[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:50.420]
But getting back to the sport situation with.

[00:50:50.700 --> 00:50:51.760]
Not that you have to suck.

[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:52.120]
Yeah.

[00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:52.920]
Warmuck.

[00:50:53.180 --> 00:50:53.280]
Right.

[00:50:53.780 --> 00:50:56.520]
Devo had some interesting insights last night.

[00:50:56.700 --> 00:50:57.160]
About what?

[00:50:57.600 --> 00:51:08.280]
When he was talking about the situation and how it's so inappropriate for the umpires to even consider.

[00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:08.940]
Right to strike.

[00:51:09.160 --> 00:51:09.160]

[00:51:10.540 --> 00:51:12.880]
And I think he really kind of hid on it.

[00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:15.760]
You know, they don't have an option.

[00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:16.700]
You know.

[00:51:16.980 --> 00:51:17.940]
Well, you know, it's interesting.

[00:51:18.100 --> 00:51:22.460]
Last night they were saying, oh, yeah, well, we can do it anyway even though our contract prevents us from doing it.

[00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:23.480]
So what the hell does that mean?

[00:51:23.700 --> 00:51:24.000]
Exactly.

[00:51:24.280 --> 00:51:28.460]
That means take the contract and wipe your rectum with it because we're not going to live up to it.

[00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:31.120]
That's like what I think it was Reagan did with the flight controllers.

[00:51:31.540 --> 00:51:31.700]
Right.

[00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:32.500]
Just fired him.

[00:51:32.560 --> 00:51:32.940]
That's right.

[00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:33.820]
Boom across the board.

[00:51:33.980 --> 00:51:35.040]
He was a hell of a guy.

[00:51:35.120 --> 00:51:35.740]
Wasn't he that Reagan?

[00:51:36.060 --> 00:51:38.160]
He didn't care about unemployment as long as it wasn't his.

[00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:39.620]
Now, of course, he can't remember any of that.

[00:51:39.760 --> 00:51:40.100]
That's true.

[00:51:40.260 --> 00:51:40.860]
What was that?

[00:51:41.420 --> 00:51:41.660]
Right.

[00:51:41.660 --> 00:51:45.000]
But anyway, you're family starved to death and they died while I was in office.

[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:46.380]
Well, I don't remember being in office.

[00:51:46.380 --> 00:51:47.640]
So what's that all about?

[00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:48.040]
Yeah.

[00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:48.480]
Yeah.

[00:51:48.680 --> 00:51:49.280]
What contrast?

[00:51:49.660 --> 00:51:50.360]
What drugs?

[00:51:50.560 --> 00:51:51.040]
What CIA?

[00:51:51.540 --> 00:51:51.860]
Exactly.

[00:51:52.180 --> 00:51:52.980]
What is the deal?

[00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:57.100]
How come people just can't get over the situation with this with the drug deals?

[00:51:57.620 --> 00:51:59.740]
I mean, how long have we been now fighting drugs?

[00:52:00.220 --> 00:52:00.620]
30 years?

[00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:01.020]
Yeah.

[00:52:01.360 --> 00:52:03.120]
And we are going to know 30 seconds.

[00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:04.160]
We are not fighting drugs.

[00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:05.580]
That's the biggest farce in history.

[00:52:05.820 --> 00:52:11.140]
Well, don't you understand that the whole DEA, the whole all of the app, app,

[00:52:11.140 --> 00:52:15.280]
for asparagus of the drug, the anti-drug organization of the government.

[00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:17.760]
All it is is just it's keeping jobs for people.

[00:52:17.900 --> 00:52:18.280]
That's all.

[00:52:18.380 --> 00:52:18.640]
That's right.

[00:52:18.740 --> 00:52:19.160]
It's employment.

[00:52:19.300 --> 00:52:20.900]
It just does two things.

[00:52:21.020 --> 00:52:23.480]
It's good public relations because it makes it look like the government's out there

[00:52:23.480 --> 00:52:24.380]
to get all the drugies.

[00:52:24.700 --> 00:52:27.540]
And number two, it employs a lot of people, a ton of people.

[00:52:27.760 --> 00:52:27.880]
Right.

[00:52:28.020 --> 00:52:30.020]
And number three, it cost the taxpayers a lot of money.

[00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:31.680]
I just think it increases their national debt.

[00:52:31.800 --> 00:52:32.000]
Right.

[00:52:32.220 --> 00:52:32.540]
That's right.

[00:52:32.920 --> 00:52:33.980]
They're not fighting drugs.

[00:52:34.160 --> 00:52:35.460]
They know nothing about fighting drugs.

[00:52:35.580 --> 00:52:36.080]
It's a joke.

[00:52:36.280 --> 00:52:36.880]
It's a farce.

[00:52:36.900 --> 00:52:37.480]
It's a mockery.

[00:52:37.600 --> 00:52:41.020]
And anybody who doesn't believe that the CIA was up to their ass and Eric had a

[00:52:41.020 --> 00:52:45.240]
subversive activity, including the Kennedy assassination and the drugs, is a moron.

[00:52:45.320 --> 00:52:45.580]
Exactly.

[00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:47.160]
It's like the speeding laws.

[00:52:47.340 --> 00:52:49.440]
Did you hear yesterday Rick and Suz were going over that?

[00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:49.820]
No.

[00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:55.040]
They've increased the penalty for the at the state level, the state troopers now for speeding.

[00:52:56.320 --> 00:53:00.500]
For when they catch you now, the levels of speeding are, you know, it's like from one to nine miles an hour,

[00:53:00.620 --> 00:53:07.580]
went up to 25 bucks and from 10 to 15 went up to like, oh, oh, thank God the governor ain't going to run out of the pro-sec before it runs out of time.

[00:53:07.740 --> 00:53:08.260]
Thank the Lord.

[00:53:08.260 --> 00:53:10.820]
As though they're, you know, they really need to look for something to do.

[00:53:11.020 --> 00:53:13.820]
They need another source of revenues, what they need. They don't need more to do.

[00:53:13.880 --> 00:53:15.120]
They need another source of revenue.

[00:53:15.220 --> 00:53:15.780]
It's a joke.

[00:53:15.980 --> 00:53:19.320]
Law enforcement in the state of Florida has to do basically with one thing only,

[00:53:19.460 --> 00:53:23.560]
and that is getting revenue for the county, for the cities and for the state.

[00:53:23.700 --> 00:53:24.040]
That's it.

[00:53:24.320 --> 00:53:25.540]
That's it. It's not about speeding.

[00:53:25.780 --> 00:53:28.540]
It's not about safety and it's not about serious crime.

[00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:29.480]
Because that's dangerous.

[00:53:29.800 --> 00:53:32.420]
I was in Cooper City this morning.

[00:53:32.620 --> 00:53:32.820]
Yeah.

[00:53:33.080 --> 00:53:33.760]
Well, that's dangerous.

[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:34.600]
Oh, tell me.

[00:53:34.700 --> 00:53:37.820]
And I was driving through, I guess it was a speed sign.

[00:53:37.820 --> 00:53:39.440]
I didn't see the sign. It was a school phone.

[00:53:39.640 --> 00:53:39.920]
Uh-oh.

[00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:42.920]
And they had three cops there just sitting there.

[00:53:43.020 --> 00:53:43.960]
You think it nailed it, yeah?

[00:53:44.100 --> 00:53:44.780]
Not this time.

[00:53:45.060 --> 00:53:47.040]
Oh, I was watching my rear, you know what I mean?

[00:53:47.140 --> 00:53:47.360]
Yeah.

[00:53:47.780 --> 00:53:50.460]
But getting back to the sports situation, you're right.

[00:53:50.580 --> 00:53:51.820]
There is absolutely no parity.

[00:53:52.260 --> 00:53:55.860]
I mean, for, you know, for what the, you know, I want to tell you something.

[00:53:56.260 --> 00:54:01.320]
The reason, the response and all the verbiage that's going on about the spitting incident,

[00:54:01.960 --> 00:54:06.280]
so far outweighs all the stuff that was said about the Michael Irvin episode.

[00:54:06.480 --> 00:54:06.660]
Yeah.

[00:54:06.660 --> 00:54:08.100]
It's not even, there's no comparison.

[00:54:08.260 --> 00:54:12.300]
So in other words, America can handle a guy screwing around with a bunch of hookers,

[00:54:12.360 --> 00:54:16.680]
even if he's married, they can handle a guy who's doing cocaine or whatever drugs he might, you know,

[00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:19.380]
a, a, a variety of smorgasborded drugs.

[00:54:19.620 --> 00:54:20.220]
That's okay.

[00:54:20.360 --> 00:54:20.480]
Right.

[00:54:20.620 --> 00:54:23.340]
But if you're spitting somebody's face, now you're really done.

[00:54:23.360 --> 00:54:24.520]
So you crossed the line, man.

[00:54:24.520 --> 00:54:25.900]
Now I'm pissed off and you're an asshole.

[00:54:26.040 --> 00:54:27.880]
If this had to do that, what is that all about?

[00:54:28.120 --> 00:54:31.120]
If this had happened in the 50s or the 60s, nothing would have been said about it.

[00:54:31.180 --> 00:54:32.620]
Although I did notice he sprayed him pretty good.

[00:54:32.620 --> 00:54:33.140]
You notice that?

[00:54:33.260 --> 00:54:33.840]
No, I did.

[00:54:33.840 --> 00:54:36.680]
You noticed that the first 600 times I saw it, but he sprayed him pretty good.

[00:54:36.820 --> 00:54:37.380]
Maybe he was practicing.

[00:54:37.420 --> 00:54:38.440]
So the moral of the, exactly.

[00:54:38.700 --> 00:54:41.660]
So the moral of the story is if you're going to spray somebody, he spritz him real good.

[00:54:41.800 --> 00:54:42.000]
Right.

[00:54:42.960 --> 00:54:43.740]
Cover him, baby.

[00:54:43.840 --> 00:54:44.020]
Right.

[00:54:44.340 --> 00:54:45.360]
And then go get an AIDS test.

[00:54:45.480 --> 00:54:48.760]
Just like the, just like the insects, if you're going to spritz him and, uh, douse him.

[00:54:48.940 --> 00:54:50.780]
Well, I'm looking forward to you coming up here to Hollywood.

[00:54:51.240 --> 00:54:52.040]
We are too, man.

[00:54:52.060 --> 00:54:54.600]
In fact, we're going up this afternoon to check out the new adjoin.

[00:54:54.920 --> 00:54:55.240]
Excellent.

[00:54:55.460 --> 00:54:56.100]
And the place too.

[00:54:56.300 --> 00:55:00.320]
Well, I, I, I would like to hear you, you know, that, uh, Neil God CD, that's cool.

[00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:01.040]
Okay.

[00:55:01.340 --> 00:55:02.200]
Have a great day, pal.

[00:55:02.200 --> 00:55:02.420]
Thank you.

[00:55:02.560 --> 00:55:02.880]
See you.

[00:55:03.280 --> 00:55:04.140]
Not today, though.

[00:55:04.560 --> 00:55:10.780]
Open line of Broward 5249463524WID and two on the green lines 1 800 944.

[00:55:11.160 --> 00:55:13.920]
I think somebody owes me an apology and bokeh by the way.

[00:55:14.600 --> 00:55:18.400]
Somebody up there with a Delphi, uh, Philadelphia cable or whatever the hell it is.

[00:55:19.180 --> 00:55:25.360]
That guy that called yesterday and had the misinformation from some misinformed telephone operator who didn't know her ass from her elbow.

[00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:31.280]
And then we get our friend, Richard on there from sports channel Florida, who gives the correct information.

[00:55:32.540 --> 00:55:37.360]
And this guy had everybody up there in bokeh panicking all along and of course a lot of the panther players live up there in bokeh.

[00:55:37.940 --> 00:55:41.940]
Although I think if, uh, if Brandon Shanahan were to come here, they'd probably move far away.

[00:55:43.300 --> 00:55:45.060]
It's, uh, I don't want to get into that thing.

[00:55:45.060 --> 00:55:46.060]
Okay, at least not today.

[00:55:46.440 --> 00:55:46.800]
Do I?

[00:55:47.800 --> 00:55:49.720]
So how's Andrew's ass in woods, by the way?

[00:55:49.920 --> 00:55:50.760]
Here's Fort Lauderdale.

[00:55:50.760 --> 00:55:51.080]
Hello.

[00:55:52.080 --> 00:55:52.340]
Neil.

[00:55:52.520 --> 00:55:52.820]
Yes, sir.

[00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:55.280]
Just got off the line with, uh, direct TV.

[00:55:55.600 --> 00:55:55.800]
Oh.

[00:55:56.440 --> 00:56:00.980]
And inquired about sports channel being available down in this area.

[00:56:01.180 --> 00:56:01.380]
Yes.

[00:56:01.580 --> 00:56:08.100]
And they looked it up and went to a supervisor and said that sports channel is being blacked out in our area.

[00:56:08.520 --> 00:56:17.680]
It's not available from direct TV and the only, uh, sports programming channel that's available is the Sunshine Network.

[00:56:17.860 --> 00:56:18.900]
That's, uh, baloney.

[00:56:19.740 --> 00:56:21.460]
What, what do you mean it's being blacked out?

[00:56:21.680 --> 00:56:25.520]
They, it's not one of those channels that you can access on the small.

[00:56:25.620 --> 00:56:26.080]
Not yet.

[00:56:26.480 --> 00:56:29.320]
We discussed that with, uh, with a guy from his fourth channel yesterday.

[00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:31.100]
And did they say it was going to be available?

[00:56:31.100 --> 00:56:31.940]
They said it will be available.

[00:56:32.060 --> 00:56:36.900]
All they're doing is looking for a, eh, see this is the problem when you, because I've talked to people in direct TV too.

[00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:38.140]
They don't know their answer from their elbow.

[00:56:38.240 --> 00:56:38.540]
You're right.

[00:56:38.620 --> 00:56:48.100]
When you talk to these people who answered telephones, whether it's at your cable company, whether it's at the, uh, your satellite, uh, programming service, they don't know what they're talking about.

[00:56:48.100 --> 00:56:48.480]
No.

[00:56:48.860 --> 00:56:58.620]
And I, I could give you, I could waste our time and give you hours and hours of stories, both on the big dish and the small dish of talking to people who are just phone operators who don't have any idea what they're talking about.

[00:56:58.880 --> 00:57:01.120]
Well, maybe somebody will call in who knows what they're talking about.

[00:57:01.120 --> 00:57:03.320]
No, they know that he already already did yesterday.

[00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:11.880]
And he promised me that as soon as they have the, uh, the MS, the absolute information, as soon as they find out whether it's going to be this week's, the Saturday's game or after that.

[00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:15.400]
And what, uh, uh, channel it'll be on, we'll be the first ones to know.

[00:57:15.620 --> 00:57:16.620]
Well, we'll stay tuned.

[00:57:16.620 --> 00:57:19.840]
But he, he just about guaranteed me that it will be on a small dish.

[00:57:19.960 --> 00:57:20.680]
God bless them.

[00:57:20.780 --> 00:57:21.520]
Okay, pal. Thanks.

[00:57:21.600 --> 00:57:21.980]
See you.

[00:57:22.900 --> 00:57:24.620]
Which doesn't, you know, make it absolute 100%.

[00:57:25.140 --> 00:57:31.040]
But he sounded pretty sure of it and all they got to do is find some spot, which by the way, Richard, if you're listing 301 is open 302.

[00:57:31.220 --> 00:57:33.380]
They can move that sports guide to someplace else.

[00:57:33.500 --> 00:57:36.260]
There's some places open there in the 300s on a direct TV.

[00:57:36.820 --> 00:57:38.920]
So we're quit using that as an excuse direct TV.

[00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:44.120]
And let's get with the program in addition to which can you imagine how many dishes they could sell or how much more programming.

[00:57:44.120 --> 00:57:49.980]
Even people have already got the small dish who may not have the sports package would be on that phone, subscribing immediately.

[00:57:49.980 --> 00:57:52.940]
If that's the way they had to do to get the Panther game starting on Saturday.

[00:57:53.940 --> 00:57:55.140]
Here's a mobile in dear field.

[00:57:55.140 --> 00:57:55.540]
Hello.

[00:57:55.700 --> 00:57:56.240]
I know.

[00:57:56.640 --> 00:57:57.040]
Okay.

[00:57:57.620 --> 00:58:00.520]
Uh, you know, watching this Alamoor thing over and over again.

[00:58:00.600 --> 00:58:04.740]
I think if you look at it real close, what happened was he didn't spit on it.

[00:58:04.760 --> 00:58:06.340]
He bumped heads with David Johnson.

[00:58:06.340 --> 00:58:07.800]
One of his this exploded.

[00:58:07.900 --> 00:58:08.620]
Oh, is that what it was?

[00:58:08.700 --> 00:58:09.380]
That's what happened.

[00:58:09.380 --> 00:58:13.340]
In fact, that might have been David Johnson's cheek that blew up in in her in her.

[00:58:13.380 --> 00:58:15.420]
Yeah, I was going to say her spelt her spelt back space.

[00:58:15.440 --> 00:58:15.680]
Yes.

[00:58:16.420 --> 00:58:20.000]
In fact, wouldn't it be funny if it was Abe her spelt and not John her spelt?

[00:58:20.040 --> 00:58:20.520]
You never know.

[00:58:20.520 --> 00:58:22.640]
Because nobody knows about spitting better than Abe her spelt.

[00:58:23.520 --> 00:58:24.200]
Thank you, Neil.

[00:58:24.460 --> 00:58:25.400]
Thanks a lot. Good point.

[00:58:25.560 --> 00:58:26.260]
Yeah, it might have been David.

[00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:27.360]
You see his neck last night.

[00:58:27.400 --> 00:58:28.280]
Oh my god.

[00:58:29.080 --> 00:58:30.200]
I'm watching that game yesterday.

[00:58:30.340 --> 00:58:33.060]
The real Cleveland game and they keep showing the close ups.

[00:58:33.060 --> 00:58:35.420]
It's the most disgusting thing I've ever seen in my life.

[00:58:35.460 --> 00:58:38.140]
This is the man who invented your push fallen apart.

[00:58:38.540 --> 00:58:41.740]
And I go and I look into mirror and I said, you know, for an old fart, you don't look all that great.

[00:58:41.820 --> 00:58:42.260]
You never did.

[00:58:42.340 --> 00:58:46.180]
But I mean, compared to David Johnson, like everything is still in the right place.

[00:58:46.400 --> 00:58:49.900]
And my skin isn't like just sagging and falling off in places where it's illegal.

[00:58:50.180 --> 00:58:51.920]
Hey, get that Michael Jordan crap, man.

[00:58:52.040 --> 00:58:53.080]
You're a, you know, it'll be great.

[00:58:53.160 --> 00:58:54.200]
You can rub it on your ball spot.

[00:58:55.940 --> 00:58:57.800]
All these people, Elizabeth Taylor.

[00:58:58.700 --> 00:59:01.980]
All these people with more money than God and goddess.

[00:59:03.080 --> 00:59:06.620]
And they're coming out with, with essence of my rectum.

[00:59:06.620 --> 00:59:07.820]
Whatever the hell it is, they're peddling.

[00:59:08.100 --> 00:59:10.740]
I think everybody in America wants to smell like Michael Jordan.

[00:59:10.880 --> 00:59:11.140]
Don't you?

[00:59:11.280 --> 00:59:11.740]
George does.

[00:59:12.640 --> 00:59:17.160]
Open line in a Broward 5249463524WI would do one on a green line.

[00:59:17.420 --> 00:59:19.000]
So how many people are calling TCI?

[00:59:19.120 --> 00:59:20.300]
By the way, here's the number for you.

[00:59:21.200 --> 00:59:22.840]
Because I don't really think it's happening.

[00:59:23.320 --> 00:59:26.180]
I heard the worst team this morning, Hock and I trying to come about it.

[00:59:26.540 --> 00:59:28.240]
And we were talking about it a lot yesterday.

[00:59:28.280 --> 00:59:30.600]
It seemed to be like the only topic anybody cared about.

[00:59:30.740 --> 00:59:32.580]
A Saturday gets nearer.

[00:59:33.380 --> 00:59:37.320]
But they claim that they're not getting like inundated with phone calls.

[00:59:37.780 --> 00:59:40.540]
So on this memo that I received here, which I wasn't supposed to,

[00:59:40.580 --> 00:59:43.460]
but nevertheless, it was passed on to me by somebody at TCI.

[00:59:43.620 --> 00:59:45.020]
This is no one from yesterday, by the way.

[00:59:45.200 --> 00:59:48.140]
This is a new one from today that doesn't have anything on it saying absolutely confidential.

[00:59:48.480 --> 00:59:49.740]
And it doesn't say not for broadcast.

[00:59:51.180 --> 00:59:53.920]
So Cheryl, B and B and Shetta.

[00:59:55.200 --> 00:59:55.980]
I beg your pardon?

[00:59:56.260 --> 00:59:56.580]
That's right.

[00:59:56.740 --> 00:59:59.300]
Cheryl B I A N C H E T T E.

[00:59:59.300 --> 01:00:01.940]
Cheryl B and Keta, Cheta, whatever it is.

[01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:06.940]
Cheryl, she's one of the haunches there at TCI South Region.

[01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:09.560]
And it says, thank you for your help.

[01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:11.160]
This is to the employees of TCI.

[01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:15.080]
And please call me with questions or direct customers to me with questions.

[01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:18.420]
So she's inviting customers who have questions about sports,

[01:00:18.420 --> 01:00:22.620]
Santa, Florida and their TCI thing to call her at 9.5.4.

[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000]
7.2.3.71.38.

[01:00:25.180 --> 01:00:27.960]
Cheryl, talk to Cheryl and let her give you a good line of BS.

[01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:29.780]
Or tell you what it's all about.

[01:00:30.140 --> 01:00:30.440]
That's it.

[01:00:30.580 --> 01:00:31.780]
Cheryl at 9.5.4.

[01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:33.940]
7.2.3.71.38.

[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:34.760]
It says, thanks again.

[01:00:34.900 --> 01:00:35.600]
You're welcome, Cheryl.

[01:00:36.420 --> 01:00:40.460]
And let's get to show on the road because Richard from a sports Channel Florida yesterday was right.

[01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:45.740]
He said the only way that you're going to like pressure these people is to inundate them with phone calls 30 or 35 a day,

[01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:46.880]
especially from the same people.

[01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:48.360]
That ain't going to get the job done.

[01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:48.640]
Okay.

[01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:51.880]
11.14 at WIOD.

[01:00:52.900 --> 01:00:54.460]
Talkin' Entertainment Radio.

[01:00:54.920 --> 01:00:57.000]
6.10.00 WIOD.

[01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:58.600]
11.17 at WIOD.

[01:00:58.680 --> 01:00:59.880]
Anybody see A.Rod?

[01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:01.440]
Alex Rodriguez with the Roy Fire.

[01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:05.780]
Speaking of people's faces falling apart, Roy Firestone's got Davey Johnson disease.

[01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:10.300]
I haven't seen Roy in some time on TV or like off TV.

[01:01:10.540 --> 01:01:15.600]
And boy, last night, what the, he got hit with the, uh, with the, uh, Davey Johnson stick.

[01:01:16.660 --> 01:01:19.500]
His neck is in the, oh, man.

[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.080]
So anyway, he had Alex Rodriguez on it.

[01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:22.660]
And it was pretty good.

[01:01:22.780 --> 01:01:23.920]
And then he had Chulon a little later.

[01:01:24.420 --> 01:01:28.600]
But the Rodriguez interview was pretty good except for the fact he got into this thing about what, you know,

[01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:32.600]
you're young and single and all these girls and guys and everybody else is running up and down the street.

[01:01:32.860 --> 01:01:39.860]
And like, oh my God, it's, uh, A.Rod and, uh, all this other, and how do you maintain your, uh, you know, your sanity and keep your perspective?

[01:01:40.220 --> 01:01:43.840]
And then, and he puts his thumb where they're supposed to be.

[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:47.540]
And he puts his thumb once was enough where they're supposed to be.

[01:01:47.540 --> 01:01:50.180]
So anyway, then he goes into that God stuff.

[01:01:51.060 --> 01:01:52.820]
And I thought, why are you doing this, Alex?

[01:01:52.980 --> 01:01:53.900]
Why are you doing this?

[01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:57.160]
You know, but well, he looks to the Lord and Lord is, uh, he was a Dominican.

[01:01:57.700 --> 01:01:58.540]
Oh, yeah, he was.

[01:01:58.620 --> 01:01:59.540]
He had the froc on too.

[01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:01.020]
He said something about froc.

[01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:02.720]
I think I was the one that was saying that.

[01:02:03.740 --> 01:02:06.080]
So Alex Rodriguez is the best player in baseball.

[01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:08.960]
I'll tell you that Juan Gonzalo is ain't far behind for Texas boy.

[01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:14.360]
He is really something else, but because he plays in that, uh, in that backwoods place there, you know, who downows?

[01:02:15.340 --> 01:02:17.060]
Here's a mobile in the golden gate.

[01:02:17.060 --> 01:02:17.900]
Whatever that might be.

[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:18.220]
Hello.

[01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:18.920]
Neil.

[01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:19.440]
Yes, sir.

[01:02:19.820 --> 01:02:23.800]
Yeah, the cable company over here, CVI just changed over to time Warner.

[01:02:24.060 --> 01:02:24.280]
Yeah.

[01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:25.920]
And we have the sports channel.

[01:02:26.020 --> 01:02:27.980]
I was watching the Panthers show the other night.

[01:02:28.020 --> 01:02:28.580]
You got it already?

[01:02:29.140 --> 01:02:29.380]
Yep.

[01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:30.040]
All right.

[01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:34.260]
They said we will see no less than 65 regular season games.

[01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:35.040]
That is correct.

[01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:35.580]
Yep.

[01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:37.800]
So I just thought you'd like to hear that.

[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:38.960]
Congratulations, pal.

[01:02:39.060 --> 01:02:39.860]
Outside of Naples.

[01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:40.340]
All right.

[01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:41.520]
Good to hear from a happy camper.

[01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:41.940]
Bye-bye.

[01:02:41.940 --> 01:02:42.660]
Congratulations.

[01:02:43.020 --> 01:02:46.840]
Yes, sports channel is carrying 65, which is all of the Panther Telecast this year.

[01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:52.560]
There will be no channel 33 because they were losing money on it and it was a bum deal all the way around and it just didn't work out.

[01:02:52.760 --> 01:02:58.960]
So all the Panther Telecast 65, which is pretty good out of an 82 game season, will be on sports channel Florida.

[01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:04.840]
So the two to 300,000 people who subscribe to TCI, let's say, I mean, how many of them might be Panther fans?

[01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:06.680]
They're saying like, you know, 10%.

[01:03:06.680 --> 01:03:11.640]
So that's 20 to 30,000 people right there who are on the verge of getting screwed and don't even feel good.

[01:03:12.700 --> 01:03:13.980]
Here's a lady in Miami Beach.

[01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:14.220]
Hello.

[01:03:14.820 --> 01:03:15.220]
Hello.

[01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:15.960]
Yes, ma'am.

[01:03:16.140 --> 01:03:17.080]
Hi, mail, how are you?

[01:03:17.260 --> 01:03:17.620]
I'm great.

[01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:18.460]
Oh, good.

[01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:20.900]
Listen, I just wanted to ask you a question.

[01:03:21.180 --> 01:03:21.320]
Yes.

[01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:27.500]
My husband heard something on your show and he's just driving me crazy to find out what movie we're talking about.

[01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:28.780]
Is that something new?

[01:03:28.940 --> 01:03:29.700]
He's driving you crazy?

[01:03:29.940 --> 01:03:30.200]
I don't know.

[01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:30.780]
He always does.

[01:03:31.380 --> 01:03:31.560]
Uh-huh.

[01:03:31.860 --> 01:03:35.100]
Um, uh, past honey, junior.

[01:03:35.900 --> 01:03:37.260]
Past the honey, junior.

[01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:37.680]
Yeah.

[01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:39.140]
What the hell is that?

[01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:40.840]
I got the honey, junior.

[01:03:41.180 --> 01:03:41.800]
Get the honey.

[01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:43.220]
Oh, is that what it was?

[01:03:43.460 --> 01:03:43.660]
Yeah.

[01:03:43.980 --> 01:03:46.040]
Okay, he doesn't know where it was from.

[01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:47.260]
Was it something new?

[01:03:47.260 --> 01:03:50.440]
And then there's one where he says grab my junior, honey.

[01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:51.680]
Yeah, maybe that was the one.

[01:03:51.880 --> 01:03:52.280]
And that one.

[01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:54.660]
It's from FATSO with Dom Delewee's Nan Bandcroft.

[01:03:54.660 --> 01:03:55.380]
Do you ever see FATSO?

[01:03:55.820 --> 01:03:56.660]
No, look at me.

[01:03:56.780 --> 01:03:57.800]
Hit the name again, FATSO.

[01:03:58.200 --> 01:03:59.080]
Let me say it again.

[01:03:59.260 --> 01:03:59.660]
FATSO.

[01:04:00.220 --> 01:04:02.460]
With Dom Delewee's an Nan Bandcroft.

[01:04:03.420 --> 01:04:04.560]
You ate the yoni.

[01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:05.160]
Exactly.

[01:04:05.500 --> 01:04:06.200]
An anivan.

[01:04:06.460 --> 01:04:07.300]
You never saw it?

[01:04:07.460 --> 01:04:07.820]
No.

[01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:08.940]
Oh, you got to see that.

[01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:09.540]
Really?

[01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:11.620]
Is anybody in your family fat?

[01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:12.440]
No.

[01:04:12.780 --> 01:04:14.380]
Oh, like I said, don't waste your time.

[01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:15.500]
No, I'm not.

[01:04:15.820 --> 01:04:16.500]
Mostly for fat people.

[01:04:16.620 --> 01:04:19.920]
If you know, if you've never been fat or you're not fat now, you know, it'll be okay.

[01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:22.960]
But it's really appreciated by people who got to wait problem, you know?

[01:04:23.260 --> 01:04:23.700]
Oh, really?

[01:04:23.900 --> 01:04:24.080]
Yeah.

[01:04:24.340 --> 01:04:25.060]
But he just...

[01:04:25.060 --> 01:04:25.800]
Fat people like me.

[01:04:26.260 --> 01:04:27.160]
He loves that thing.

[01:04:27.460 --> 01:04:28.120]
Oh, you're not fat.

[01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:28.880]
Oh, yes, I am.

[01:04:29.140 --> 01:04:29.580]
Uh, no.

[01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:33.280]
By the way, thanks to Marcy and Walgreens yesterday when I went in there to pick up a couple of things.

[01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:35.340]
You say, I, you look so much better, the thin version.

[01:04:35.820 --> 01:04:38.760]
I said, just shut up and bring up the Snickers' cones and cut the crap.

[01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:40.180]
Thank you, Marcy.

[01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:40.860]
Okay, honey.

[01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:41.440]
And you too.

[01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:41.820]
Right.

[01:04:42.020 --> 01:04:42.260]
So, yeah.

[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:43.880]
Yes, he was very nice.

[01:04:44.100 --> 01:04:46.520]
I mean, isn't that nice to go into like a drug store and have a couple of things?

[01:04:46.660 --> 01:04:48.520]
Yes, I did get a couple of Snickers' cones.

[01:04:48.520 --> 01:04:50.140]
I'm sorry, but they just...

[01:04:50.140 --> 01:04:51.080]
They happen to carry them.

[01:04:51.740 --> 01:04:52.860]
It's like the Nike thing.

[01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:53.900]
No, you're carrying them.

[01:04:53.920 --> 01:04:56.780]
Do we get rid of the Nike logo or do we get rid of the Snickers' cones first?

[01:04:56.980 --> 01:04:59.540]
Because Snickers' cones are addictive and dangerous to your health.

[01:04:59.980 --> 01:05:01.600]
They're dangerous to mine because I can't stop.

[01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:03.840]
I can't stop the Snickers' cones.

[01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:06.700]
Like Dom Delewese said, I can't stop the Fat Ma.

[01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:08.660]
Remember that?

[01:05:09.140 --> 01:05:12.260]
When he was talking to his mother's picture, I can't stop the Fat Ma.

[01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:13.760]
Look at your chubby boy now.

[01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:18.900]
Open line indeed, 7519-463-751.

[01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:19.900]
You're Akee Yoni.

[01:05:20.300 --> 01:05:20.860]
Here's Hollywood.

[01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:21.260]
Hello.

[01:05:21.940 --> 01:05:22.860]
Father Jim Bob.

[01:05:23.220 --> 01:05:23.700]
Hey.

[01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:25.040]
How you doing?

[01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:26.120]
Good.

[01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:27.520]
You're not from Luke, sorry.

[01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:28.080]
Huh?

[01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:29.140]
You're not from Luke's.

[01:05:29.260 --> 01:05:30.020]
No, I'm not for you.

[01:05:30.020 --> 01:05:32.580]
I bet they're having a rip-roaring time over there.

[01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:33.380]
It sounds like the best.

[01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:35.680]
The only thing I find a thing about S. U. N. was that guy from Luke's.

[01:05:35.700 --> 01:05:39.880]
And I wish he could hear you today and just get a reply from him about that little...

[01:05:39.880 --> 01:05:42.840]
Well, the best part of that whole deal was that guy was a put on.

[01:05:43.100 --> 01:05:44.820]
Because it turns out that guy really loved the show.

[01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:46.500]
But it was just... it was great.

[01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:47.380]
Yeah, he was.

[01:05:47.660 --> 01:05:47.840]
Yeah.

[01:05:48.100 --> 01:05:50.520]
I got a little spy report for you about your friend in mine.

[01:05:50.820 --> 01:05:52.340]
Everyone's pal, Pat Robertson.

[01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:53.960]
Yeah?

[01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:56.260]
He was on your lap and I got a navel, right?

[01:05:56.860 --> 01:05:59.320]
And he had a little thing on here today about my navel.

[01:05:59.320 --> 01:05:59.760]
Huh?

[01:06:00.180 --> 01:06:00.860]
You got a navel?

[01:06:00.980 --> 01:06:01.680]
I got a navel.

[01:06:01.940 --> 01:06:02.180]
Yeah.

[01:06:02.460 --> 01:06:02.620]
Yeah.

[01:06:03.500 --> 01:06:04.300]
I bet he'd like that.

[01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:04.860]
What?

[01:06:05.100 --> 01:06:05.900]
I bet he'd like that.

[01:06:06.020 --> 01:06:06.600]
Oh, he loved it.

[01:06:06.740 --> 01:06:11.020]
And they had a whole little spiel on today about navel persons and body persons in general.

[01:06:11.980 --> 01:06:15.960]
And he even had a little doctrine, doctor from Miami, who...

[01:06:15.960 --> 01:06:17.200]
It's not body person, by the way.

[01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:18.520]
It's body mutilation.

[01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:19.180]
All right.

[01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:21.300]
When in doubt mutilated out.

[01:06:21.860 --> 01:06:22.760]
I love it.

[01:06:23.160 --> 01:06:25.140]
And then you got...

[01:06:25.140 --> 01:06:25.180]
And then you got...

[01:06:25.180 --> 01:06:28.520]
And then you got into the whole thing about after the doctor had done his little spiel.

[01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:29.000]
That...

[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:29.360]
I bet you...

[01:06:29.360 --> 01:06:31.360]
I bet you that's only one step away from self abuse.

[01:06:31.620 --> 01:06:33.620]
Oh, and it's not only that, it's Satanism.

[01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:34.160]
Mm-hmm.

[01:06:35.080 --> 01:06:36.760]
Probably the devil made these people do it.

[01:06:36.860 --> 01:06:38.140]
Those people that got those...

[01:06:38.140 --> 01:06:41.840]
Especially the ones that got the little ring in their tip of their penis.

[01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:43.860]
Well, you didn't even get into that.

[01:06:44.060 --> 01:06:44.780]
Oh my god.

[01:06:44.780 --> 01:06:46.100]
But the thing is now he did...

[01:06:46.100 --> 01:06:47.480]
The three basic things of the Satanism.

[01:06:47.580 --> 01:06:48.600]
First you got your baby killers.

[01:06:49.060 --> 01:06:49.260]
Yeah.

[01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:49.800]
Your abortionist.

[01:06:50.060 --> 01:06:51.920]
And then of course you went to those dirty facts.

[01:06:52.200 --> 01:06:52.660]
Of course.

[01:06:53.180 --> 01:06:55.240]
Well, you know, he put the baby killers before the dirty facts.

[01:06:55.520 --> 01:06:55.660]
Yeah.

[01:06:55.660 --> 01:06:56.620]
Right, but the third...

[01:06:56.620 --> 01:06:57.060]
Well, that's good.

[01:06:57.200 --> 01:06:59.060]
We're moving out down the rougher in and around.

[01:06:59.380 --> 01:07:05.900]
But the third was those people who mutilate their body and take it out of God's image the way God created them.

[01:07:06.100 --> 01:07:06.360]
Uh-huh.

[01:07:06.580 --> 01:07:09.020]
Meanwhile, I'll sit there next to his, you know, his little...

[01:07:09.020 --> 01:07:10.380]
Prodigy, his little girlfriend here.

[01:07:10.820 --> 01:07:12.560]
Does that include that bad...

[01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:13.920]
Wig that Ernest Langeley wears?

[01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:14.880]
Includes circumcizers.

[01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:15.500]
Yeah.

[01:07:15.820 --> 01:07:17.240]
I wonder if Pat Robinson circumcised.

[01:07:18.020 --> 01:07:20.560]
Because other than that, he's mutilated and he's a Satanist.

[01:07:22.180 --> 01:07:22.980]
Ha-ha.

[01:07:23.260 --> 01:07:24.840]
Only his masseuse knows for sure.

[01:07:25.220 --> 01:07:30.360]
And, uh, you know, if you want to get sports channel, all you got to do is do what Rupert Murdoch didn't just bribe him.

[01:07:30.940 --> 01:07:31.240]
Yeah.

[01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:32.360]
You know, you get in that...

[01:07:32.360 --> 01:07:35.820]
T.C.I. is getting that Fox News channel, like the fifth news channel we're getting now.

[01:07:35.980 --> 01:07:36.240]
Mm-hmm.

[01:07:36.360 --> 01:07:38.200]
What he did was he went out to cable companies.

[01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:39.500]
This is what I read in the paper.

[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:41.260]
He went out to cable companies and said,

[01:07:41.720 --> 01:07:44.640]
I'll pay you $13 per subscriber if you carry my news station.

[01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:45.660]
And T.C.I.

[01:07:45.720 --> 01:07:46.640]
Oh, I'm sure we can do that.

[01:07:46.740 --> 01:07:47.060]
Here you go.

[01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:48.220]
We have room for you now.

[01:07:48.260 --> 01:07:49.460]
No, no, you're missing the point.

[01:07:49.560 --> 01:07:50.460]
That's what they want to do.

[01:07:50.520 --> 01:07:51.720]
They want to make it a paid channel.

[01:07:51.880 --> 01:07:54.340]
So those people who want to get it have to pay extra for it.

[01:07:54.340 --> 01:07:56.340]
And they're saying, well, we're going to have to pay more for it.

[01:07:56.360 --> 01:07:57.400]
So we don't want to all the subs...

[01:07:57.400 --> 01:07:59.660]
You know, if they charge all their subscribers,

[01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:01.580]
how much is it going to come out to a month?

[01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:02.120]
A dime?

[01:08:02.580 --> 01:08:03.200]
Fifteen cents?

[01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:06.100]
How much can one channel, how much additional can it cost?

[01:08:06.360 --> 01:08:06.520]
Yeah.

[01:08:06.680 --> 01:08:07.340]
You thought I was saying?

[01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:08.100]
A few cents.

[01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:09.780]
A few cents that nobody would even notice in their bill.

[01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:10.940]
And since when have they been...

[01:08:10.940 --> 01:08:13.760]
Since when have they been picky about raising their customers rates anyway?

[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:14.920]
They do it all the time.

[01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:17.360]
Well, I think Wayne's behind it.

[01:08:17.420 --> 01:08:19.200]
Make sure you get sell-ups at the arena all the time.

[01:08:19.460 --> 01:08:19.860]
Good point.

[01:08:20.180 --> 01:08:20.260]
Yeah.

[01:08:20.360 --> 01:08:20.760]
Okay, pal.

[01:08:20.780 --> 01:08:21.100]
Thank you.

[01:08:21.780 --> 01:08:24.500]
We have an open line of Broward 5249463.

[01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:25.000]
That's a good idea.

[01:08:25.280 --> 01:08:26.380]
We don't have to worry about that.

[01:08:26.480 --> 01:08:28.280]
We got almost 12,000 season tickets sold.

[01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:29.860]
They're going to be like in the rafters.

[01:08:29.880 --> 01:08:31.440]
That's going to be a hard ticket to get this year.

[01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:35.160]
Unless, of course, I have to sell mine because I got those idiots in my section.

[01:08:35.500 --> 01:08:36.940]
Here's West Palm on the Purple Line.

[01:08:37.020 --> 01:08:37.200]
Hello.

[01:08:38.060 --> 01:08:38.380]
Neil.

[01:08:38.540 --> 01:08:38.880]
Yes, sir.

[01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:39.900]
Good morning, how you doing?

[01:08:39.900 --> 01:08:40.520]
I'm doing great.

[01:08:40.820 --> 01:08:41.840]
I got a bank story.

[01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:43.220]
I think you got to love the hair.

[01:08:43.420 --> 01:08:43.620]
Yeah.

[01:08:44.200 --> 01:08:44.700]
I get a letter.

[01:08:44.700 --> 01:08:46.080]
I better shut your outfit trap.

[01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:46.640]
Shut your trap.

[01:08:46.900 --> 01:08:47.140]
Go ahead.

[01:08:47.480 --> 01:08:48.600]
Go ahead and run her packs.

[01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:50.260]
I'm going to have to worry about that knitwear.

[01:08:50.820 --> 01:08:53.260]
I get a letter in the mail the other day for first union bank.

[01:08:53.780 --> 01:08:56.340]
I don't think with them now about a used-how car loan with them.

[01:08:56.460 --> 01:08:58.800]
So I'll put it up and it's a class action lawsuit.

[01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:00.940]
I got one of those.

[01:09:01.700 --> 01:09:04.300]
Oh, about charging insurance when you don't have insurance?

[01:09:04.540 --> 01:09:05.680]
Right, but they never did that to me.

[01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:07.280]
So I'm not part of the class action lawsuit.

[01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:08.860]
Oh, well, they did it to me.

[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:10.000]
Well, then you know all about it.

[01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:11.040]
24 million bucks.

[01:09:11.240 --> 01:09:11.400]
Right.

[01:09:12.060 --> 01:09:12.720]
I'll be damned.

[01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:18.520]
Yeah, they were like, you know, they were putting car insurance through for people who already had insurance.

[01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:20.280]
And without even them knowing about it.

[01:09:20.420 --> 01:09:20.780]
Exactly.

[01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:22.480]
They never told me anything about it.

[01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:22.740]
Right.

[01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:23.820]
Okay, Neil.

[01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:24.800]
How a good day.

[01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:26.460]
Don't spend it all on placement.

[01:09:26.820 --> 01:09:27.160]
Okay.

[01:09:27.340 --> 01:09:27.620]
Okay.

[01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:27.940]
Okay.

[01:09:28.520 --> 01:09:29.520]
Open line on the purple line.

[01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:30.080]
Pound IOD.

[01:09:30.140 --> 01:09:31.440]
We have two in Broward all of a sudden.

[01:09:32.340 --> 01:09:33.060]
5249-463.

[01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:37.140]
The wicked hand of the Lord must have come down and stricken those people in Broward as they were holding their instruments.

[01:09:37.420 --> 01:09:38.160]
Or maybe their phones.

[01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:40.320]
5249-463.

[01:09:40.740 --> 01:09:41.820]
Here's the lady in the gables.

[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:42.180]
Hello.

[01:09:43.300 --> 01:09:43.940]
Yes, ma'am?

[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:44.200]
Hi.

[01:09:44.380 --> 01:09:46.660]
I just wanted to call and give you a big report.

[01:09:46.660 --> 01:09:47.400]
Uh-huh.

[01:09:47.580 --> 01:09:48.340]
My MAPH.

[01:09:48.440 --> 01:09:49.520]
I got caught this morning.

[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:50.400]
Point going.

[01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:51.660]
You got caught?

[01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:52.140]
Yes.

[01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:55.140]
Got with their little radar gun.

[01:09:55.180 --> 01:09:56.680]
I hope they get a particular cancer.

[01:09:56.860 --> 01:09:57.840]
But anyway, we won't go there.

[01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:02.120]
They caught me going 56 and a 40 on a 3 lane.

[01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:02.820]
Oh, hey.

[01:10:03.300 --> 01:10:04.220]
3 lane highway.

[01:10:04.580 --> 01:10:04.760]
Yeah.

[01:10:04.920 --> 01:10:07.520]
So, I think, do you think-

[01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:09.420]
What was this on the Julia Tuttle on the MacArthur?

[01:10:09.420 --> 01:10:10.640]
I'm a Carthor Cosway.

[01:10:10.660 --> 01:10:10.840]
Yeah.

[01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:14.640]
Every morning there, there was four of them just standing around.

[01:10:14.640 --> 01:10:15.620]
I'm just going to go there every morning.

[01:10:15.820 --> 01:10:17.540]
Why don't you lighten up a little bit?

[01:10:18.640 --> 01:10:20.160]
Cut it back to about 73.

[01:10:22.060 --> 01:10:23.560]
I should have been going 73.

[01:10:23.780 --> 01:10:25.480]
No, I just think it's really ridiculous.

[01:10:25.740 --> 01:10:27.580]
That road is like a highway.

[01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:28.600]
It's a 3 lane highway.

[01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:29.920]
Why should this be limit before?

[01:10:30.260 --> 01:10:30.540]
Right.

[01:10:31.060 --> 01:10:31.340]
You're right.

[01:10:31.480 --> 01:10:31.660]
And I think-

[01:10:31.660 --> 01:10:31.660]

[01:10:31.660 --> 01:10:35.020]
That's a very convenient and easy way for them to nail people.

[01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:36.720]
And, you know, squeeze the box on.

[01:10:36.940 --> 01:10:37.800]
It's a business.

[01:10:38.040 --> 01:10:39.020]
Don't you people understand?

[01:10:39.400 --> 01:10:40.040]
It's a business.

[01:10:40.180 --> 01:10:41.300]
It has nothing to do with safety.

[01:10:41.820 --> 01:10:42.780]
It has nothing to do with worry.

[01:10:42.780 --> 01:10:45.480]
I mean, you see the way people drive in Dave County.

[01:10:45.480 --> 01:10:46.700]
Do you think they care about safety?

[01:10:47.340 --> 01:10:49.080]
They put people out here on the road that just came in.

[01:10:49.100 --> 01:10:50.460]
They just rolled it off a banana boat.

[01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:52.180]
Who don't even know what the Ella Car is all about.

[01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:53.780]
Don't know where to stick the ignition.

[01:10:54.060 --> 01:10:54.180]
Yeah.

[01:10:54.240 --> 01:10:54.860]
Just stick the key.

[01:10:55.160 --> 01:10:55.380]
Yep.

[01:10:56.260 --> 01:10:56.700]
And-

[01:10:56.700 --> 01:10:57.740]
As in their rectum.

[01:10:57.900 --> 01:10:58.000]
Right.

[01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:01.420]
And I think it might also have something to do with the little, uh,

[01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:03.340]
I don't know.

[01:11:03.820 --> 01:11:06.340]
All these rich people on Palm and Star Island.

[01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:08.340]
They probably don't want people like-

[01:11:08.340 --> 01:11:09.600]
Well, screw them, okay.

[01:11:09.740 --> 01:11:10.880]
I'm sure they don't want to worry.

[01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:12.540]
They don't want to need a Brian's house and break bread.

[01:11:12.900 --> 01:11:15.280]
Let him go over and see the Bee Gees and break a leg.

[01:11:16.860 --> 01:11:17.680]
I think so.

[01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:18.860]
Don't do it against me, though.

[01:11:18.920 --> 01:11:19.560]
No, I'm not.

[01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:20.000]
Okay.

[01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:20.700]
Bye.

[01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:23.660]
Okay, govern yourselves accordingly, folks.

[01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:24.620]
That's all I can tell you.

[01:11:24.700 --> 01:11:26.520]
They're waiting in the woods out there for you now.

[01:11:27.140 --> 01:11:28.100]
They're waiting in the woods.

[01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:31.820]
Your neighborhoods, you can't walk five blocks without getting mugged, murdered, or maybe both.

[01:11:32.540 --> 01:11:35.660]
But hey, you can't drive more than three miles an hour of the speed limit.

[01:11:35.800 --> 01:11:36.680]
They got you nailed.

[01:11:36.800 --> 01:11:37.540]
That's what's floored.

[01:11:37.540 --> 01:11:38.020]
It's all about.

[01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:38.720]
Get used to it.

[01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:39.280]
Get over it.

[01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:40.140]
Not going to change.

[01:11:40.140 --> 01:11:41.420]
You're not going to do anything about it.

[01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:43.160]
I've been screaming about that for years.

[01:11:43.320 --> 01:11:43.960]
Nobody cares.

[01:11:44.060 --> 01:11:46.000]
Until they get the ticket, nobody else can-

[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.420]
Well, they're out there protecting us and getting these dangerous drivers.

[01:11:48.660 --> 01:11:57.040]
The dangerous drivers are the old parts who can't see, who can't hear, or sitting on six telephone books to get up to the steering wheel, and who are just a nightmare on the road.

[01:11:57.300 --> 01:12:00.100]
Who are going like 20 miles under the speed limit in the left-hand lane.

[01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:03.180]
Who are like weaving in their big juveniles in the middle lane and-

[01:12:03.180 --> 01:12:05.160]
They're driving in all three lanes at the same time.

[01:12:05.420 --> 01:12:06.620]
They're driving in the lowest lane.

[01:12:06.620 --> 01:12:11.560]
Those are the dangerous people, and when's the last time you saw anybody pull over for driving like that?

[01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:12.040]
Mr.

[01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:15.680]

Can't beat that gator meat.

[01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:42.140]
Oh my God.

[01:12:42.940 --> 01:12:44.300]
Oh not.

[01:12:45.100 --> 01:12:49.100]
People are watching women of their brand.

[01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:51.280]
They're green-rooting people.

[01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:56.160]
But I'm not sharing some say his brain-less.

[01:12:56.440 --> 01:12:58.880]
That night's gonna talk in.

[01:12:59.420 --> 01:13:02.920]
Not much to look at, but I ain't looking.

[01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:06.880]
This smells just a little too much.

[01:13:07.300 --> 01:13:11.120]
This is as all a little too close.

[01:13:12.140 --> 01:13:16.320]
His mouth is just a little too long.

[01:13:17.620 --> 01:13:20.380]
But while they're grown-ins,

[01:13:20.420 --> 01:13:22.580]
I will be lonely darling.

[01:13:23.080 --> 01:13:26.380]
His got a really big trouser trowel.

[01:13:27.200 --> 01:13:30.660]
The girls with screaming be let it out.

[01:13:32.020 --> 01:13:35.400]
His got a really big trouser trowel.

[01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:40.000]
I'm fishing for the world.

[01:13:41.900 --> 01:13:45.040]
His got a really big trouser trowel.

[01:13:47.300 --> 01:13:48.900]
Oh my God.

[01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:50.340]
Oh no.

[01:13:51.800 --> 01:14:00.040]
His got a really big trouser trowel.

[01:14:00.740 --> 01:14:04.000]
His got a really big trouser trowel.

[01:14:05.220 --> 01:14:08.680]
His got a really big trouser trowel.

[01:14:08.840 --> 01:14:09.820]
Not that you have to stop.

[01:14:09.820 --> 01:14:13.920]
His got a really big trouser trowel.

[01:14:13.940 --> 01:14:22.500]
He's got a really big trouser trowel.

[01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:23.160]
He's got a really big trouser trowel.

[01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:29.100]
He's got a really big trouser trowel.

[01:14:29.140 --> 01:14:39.800]
I'm trying to get something clear to you.

[01:14:43.260 --> 01:14:47.360]
I'm trying to get something clear to you.

[01:14:53.160 --> 01:14:54.320]
I'm trying to get something clear to you.

[01:14:54.320 --> 01:14:54.380]
I'm trying to get something clear to you.

[01:14:54.580 --> 01:14:56.560]
I'm trying to get something clear to you.

[01:14:56.560 --> 01:15:02.460]
I'm trying to get something clear to you.

[01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:09.780]
I'm trying to get something clear to you.

[01:15:09.780 --> 01:15:10.200]
Okay.

[01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:11.800]
No more sunshine, no more.

[01:15:12.060 --> 01:15:14.400]
Sunshine is still there but they don't have the patterns anymore.

[01:15:14.780 --> 01:15:17.020]
And they're not going to have the marlins anymore next year either.

[01:15:17.700 --> 01:15:17.740]
Okay.

[01:15:17.740 --> 01:15:19.400]
No, 33 now.

[01:15:19.940 --> 01:15:33.360]
That's the other thing is that some of the packs and the article that they did in excess and some of them are telling me what's the big thing now that you can't you can't you say

[01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:35.700]

[01:16:14.980 --> 01:16:18.360]

brain but most of the american public gets swept up in whatever the media

[01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:48.440]
hype is of the day so if a bunch of people decided because they got the

[01:16:48.440 --> 01:16:50.540]
video clip and they can show it eight million times

[01:16:50.540 --> 01:16:54.200]

because he pulled his groin he ran into hex doll yesterday poor baby in practice and we did his groin

[01:23:04.980 --> 01:23:09.120]

[01:24:59.500 --> 01:25:02.520]
of the show is like he got two living people on there are like one and a half

[01:25:03.220 --> 01:25:07.700]
suds and half a rick and i'm telling you they're gonna get there they're gonna have a number in

[01:25:07.700 --> 01:25:11.620]
there that's gonna shock the living daylights out a lot of you including that one that called yesterday

[01:25:11.620 --> 01:25:17.020]
you know the guy that called twice we've had two calls Tuesday and Wednesday

[01:25:17.740 --> 01:25:21.700]
both days and i'm a little bit slow on my old age but now i was thinking about it this morning coming

[01:25:21.700 --> 01:25:27.700]
to work those were both cox calls see in the past we had the q a m setup calls from Andrew

[01:25:27.700 --> 01:25:32.820]
assing with boyfriends and now we're starting to get the cox calls of course probably like even

[01:25:32.820 --> 01:25:38.820]
while we're in the same building remember in when a stranger calls he says the other phone is in the

[01:25:38.820 --> 01:25:42.480]
house he's in the house in other words it like in the inside we're in the same building and the

[01:25:42.480 --> 01:25:47.660]
call is coming from there there's Roberto Alamar by the way who said on you that's what he said

[01:25:47.660 --> 01:25:51.660]
to the media guys i said what's the big deal already huh each ever seen little spittle and you

[01:25:51.660 --> 01:25:55.720]
notice every time they showed a shot in yesterday's games which i did watch all are part of all three

[01:25:55.720 --> 01:26:00.560]
games every time they show part of a game guys in the dugout are spitting all of their like slabber

[01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:04.560]
all over the place now i think he's a brought back a i mean baseball players have always spit a

[01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:09.340]

let me ask you something yes with with latins spitting is probably the most i mean with

[01:26:24.780 --> 01:26:29.180]
latins have a special significance for spitting that's the big effect exactly that's the most

[01:26:29.180 --> 01:26:33.160]
offensive thing you can do to somebody a spit at them or in their face or just in their direction

[01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:37.120]
like saying you are the lowest calm on the face right either that or mention their mother

i call to tell you how happy i am but how happy you are yeah i mean the tone of your voice is just like

[01:31:04.540 --> 01:31:09.100]
so much of the stress seems to be relieved that's right doc in my blood pressure is real good even

[01:31:09.100 --> 01:31:12.280]
though i am fat how do you like that my pressure was sensational i'm going to come and see

[01:31:12.280 --> 01:31:16.320]
them are afternoon okay well that's part of what i'm calling about after months and months and

[01:31:16.320 --> 01:31:20.320]
months of trying the hassling with banks and lawyers in the city of my any beach and my soon to be

[01:31:20.640 --> 01:31:25.900]
x-wife i'm able to close on my house tomorrow so i might not be here when you get here so we might

[01:31:25.900 --> 01:31:29.000]
run a reschedule but i'll leave it up to you because all you really need is to get your blood drawn

[01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:32.720]
oh no i'm not coming here unless you're there okay now let me ask you this because it was a very

[01:31:32.720 --> 01:31:37.520]
interesting message that your girl left on my machine which one the one about how since tomorrow is

[01:31:37.520 --> 01:31:41.980]
our last day well anyway it's not our last day well i heard that yeah so that's even better news

[01:31:41.980 --> 01:31:44.960]
so you're either the beginning the week and i'll come see the beginning the week and like that

[01:31:44.960 --> 01:31:48.800]
it worked out perfect see there had to be some good reason for us having to come back here one or two

[01:31:48.800 --> 01:31:53.820]
more times i felt the same way so whatever leave i get i just found out that i'm closing some and

[01:31:53.820 --> 01:31:57.720]
screw up your schedule and congratulations that's great so in other words you got rid of that

[01:31:57.720 --> 01:32:01.520]
l'm out see that you had that with the article was in the paper about that's right the albatross

[01:32:01.520 --> 01:32:06.840]
the right the uh... two hundred thousand dollar albatross the only albatross that we ever liked

[01:32:06.840 --> 01:32:09.660]
is the one Stanley dancer drill but then you're not into racing so what do you know

[01:32:09.660 --> 01:32:14.320]
i also i'm also listening to these stories about uh... the athletes and so forth

[01:32:14.320 --> 01:32:18.900]
their behavior is despicable and maybe there's going to be a start via back lash against that kind

[01:32:18.900 --> 01:32:23.600]
of behavior yeah unfortunately i don't know i'm not into it that much so i get to emotional about it

[01:32:23.600 --> 01:32:28.700]
good but uh... maybe uh... maybe a new conservativeism in terms of behavior but then again that ends

[01:32:28.700 --> 01:32:32.700]
up in turns into censorship when the uh... when the pendulum swings too far the other way

[01:32:33.260 --> 01:32:38.460]
very profound i think but you're you what you thought of that already i have no doubt nobody else

[01:32:38.460 --> 01:32:44.640]
said it sure thanks mark cc can graduate break a leg on your house oh god please i don't that applies

[01:32:44.640 --> 01:32:49.540]
to acting in performing that not not to closing on how's it okay i don't want to break anything except

[01:32:49.540 --> 01:32:55.060]

[01:40:22.920 --> 01:40:27.100]
keep the pressure up guys like i said make those calls what do you think about it right now we got

[01:40:27.560 --> 01:40:29.060]
about who uh... Troy

[01:40:29.880 --> 01:40:34.320]
Troy great and for oh draightened from uh from the ram yeah yeah i think that's a step in a right

[01:40:34.320 --> 01:40:38.840]
erection man i think that uh... keep sim the keep the buyers was never gonna be a uh... tight end

[01:40:38.840 --> 01:40:42.840]
and it was useless all the last season and didn't do very much this year either and it comes

[01:40:42.840 --> 01:40:46.900]
the time when you hang it up and you don't knock the coach and you just gracefully step aside and

[01:40:47.020 --> 01:40:51.820]
good luck to him yeah my brother he's uh... pf lice and told her up there he says yeah draightened

[01:40:51.820 --> 01:40:55.600]
was in the doghouse that's the reason why his numbers were down and plus the surgery in the

[01:40:55.600 --> 01:40:59.980]
offseason he just didn't get off to a great start and he goes yeah he goes he's gonna be a hell of

[01:40:59.980 --> 01:41:03.160]
not only that look at the crap team he was playing out true that's why it's that so will they

[01:41:03.160 --> 01:41:07.720]
say to you in a very good blocker he says well damn team don't block he can't be one guy blocking

[01:41:07.720 --> 01:41:12.200]
yeah so i think yeah that's true he'll be a big improvement over whatever we got trust me

[01:41:12.200 --> 01:41:15.320]

[01:41:15.320 --> 01:41:20.160]

[01:41:23.500 --> 01:41:28.060]
he was probably one of the t-seye people trying to cut down the flood of calls trying to well you know

[01:41:28.060 --> 01:41:32.340]

[01:42:58.980 --> 01:43:05.280]
team thing uh... one was reading with uh... with jennifer like he'd read a paragraph on a story and

[01:43:05.280 --> 01:43:08.880]

[01:43:09.460 --> 01:43:12.440]
yeah kind of for maddox is that also something from the uh... the new owners

[01:43:13.620 --> 01:43:18.980]

I knew I just talked to continental cable vision yes and you know when you get something they

[01:47:24.140 --> 01:47:29.940]
take something away so they're they're taking away w or r isn't that a kick in the teeth

[01:47:29.940 --> 01:47:36.740]
yeah instead instead of taking off that stupid food channel or one of those idiotic uh that's

[01:47:36.740 --> 01:47:40.300]
exactly what I asked them right I said when should take off the food channel with that god channel

[01:47:40.300 --> 01:47:45.800]
right so all well with the god channel you know you that you call we have to carry that it's a

[01:47:45.800 --> 01:47:49.820]
must carry channel well that's true forty five I have to carry that yeah and uh but the food

[01:47:49.820 --> 01:47:54.980]

[01:48:16.260 --> 01:48:20.800]
for them for whatever your pan what they're doing is robbing Peter to pay Paul yeah as I said

[01:48:20.800 --> 01:48:26.420]
they give me take away right that's right they always do that okay now good luck to pound thank you

[01:57:38.560 --> 01:57:42.620]

[01:57:42.620 --> 01:57:46.680]
slow i kicked up my heels kicked a little lush muts in your push and all of a sudden they responded

[01:57:46.680 --> 01:57:50.460]
phenomenally just like yesterday and we had a lot of people out there with something to say not

[01:57:50.460 --> 01:57:55.620]
too much of it too interesting we've been doing dishes and dishes and dishes and MCIs and MCIs and

TCI's and PPs and whatever else 751 9463 we'll end here from some more guys single straight guys

[01:58:04.740 --> 01:58:10.880]
over the age of 30 besides Phil Henry i'm sorry i think that most guys and now what about women

[01:58:10.880 --> 01:58:14.720]
how old is a woman have to go before getting married before she's considered an old maid

[01:58:14.720 --> 01:58:23.780]
which is code for dyke 35 yeah 32 32 so if you're female it never been married and you're over 32

[01:58:23.780 --> 01:58:29.380]
you're a dyke whether you know it or not or psycho bitch here's sunrise hello hello yes sir hey now i

[01:58:29.380 --> 01:58:35.420]
don't let me get down to the point on the let's get right to it yeah the athletes the athletes get

[01:58:35.420 --> 01:58:41.960]
in trouble uh basically the bottom line is that uh the fans don't give a fly in for oxfowl

[01:58:41.960 --> 01:58:46.660]
they just they don't care about uh about what goes on in the athletes you know so what's with that

[01:58:46.660 --> 01:58:50.420]
layer they so concerned about somebody spitting in the umpire space why is this like the greatest

[01:58:50.420 --> 01:58:54.740]
thing you want to know why it's just on me because it happened right in the uh in front of exactly

[01:58:54.740 --> 01:58:59.100]
right there you go everybody we didn't see we didn't see Michael Irvin there in at the in the white

[01:58:59.100 --> 01:59:02.720]
house uh carrying on and doing all that crap and all the cocaine they wouldn't care if Michael

[01:59:02.720 --> 01:59:07.220]
Irvin was driving the white Bronco yeah they really wouldn't care it's that's just like you

[01:59:07.220 --> 01:59:10.840]
relevant to them as long as they they he's winning football games even if he's not you know whatever

[01:59:10.840 --> 01:59:15.840]
if as long as he's doing his job you know how do we know it was they seeing not MI exactly yeah

[01:59:15.840 --> 01:59:20.680]
good point all right you that's all I had excellent points sir thank you that's right you don't

[01:59:20.680 --> 01:59:24.840]
give a crap and you also don't give a crap about Roberto Alamar Jr just act in indignant and you're

[01:59:24.840 --> 01:59:28.340]
a bunch of hypocrites and I bet you a lot of you guys spitting the whoever's face you want

[01:59:29.020 --> 01:59:35.580]
you never spitting a push we have an open line and Broward 5249463524 w i i should have asked

[01:59:35.580 --> 01:59:39.240]
that Julio that was under the 30 year old has never been married who got dumped if he was like

[01:59:39.240 --> 01:59:42.800]
impotent and then he would have probably pulled a tom cruise on us and got pissed off

[01:59:43.400 --> 01:59:48.340]
maybe that was the problem maybe he just couldn't make that damn thing work if he would just

[01:59:48.340 --> 01:59:53.400]
let it breathe a little bit here's the mobile in high alia hello from the old yes sir

[02:00:19.040 --> 02:00:26.940]

[02:00:26.940 --> 02:00:32.400]
rickensuds the new and improved better and brighter and smarter rickensuds 2 to 6 let's hear a lot

[02:00:32.400 --> 02:00:36.460]
of phone calls from people who really are enjoying rickensuds in the afternoon come on let's go

[02:00:36.460 --> 02:00:41.540]
right now i want numbers one through seven hundred check it in with me right now you don't think the

[02:00:41.540 --> 02:00:46.120]
fact that they're actually inheriting an audience into a clock might help a little bit what no what

[02:00:46.120 --> 02:00:52.000]
is that they had great numbers before when they were on in the afternoon and the fact that

[02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:55.700]
they're inheriting it to a clock a sizeable audience and hopefully still a big number we pray

[02:00:56.120 --> 02:01:01.000]
that can't hurt as opposed to starting from like a from a sitting still position at six o'clock

[02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:05.700]
in the morning on a station which overnight and late at night has got nobody listening now here's

[02:01:05.700 --> 02:01:10.720]
the deal dr. Laura is going off nights as a friday and then moving over to i and z 10 a m to

[02:01:10.720 --> 02:01:15.560]
noon starting monday and then lord acid on i and z from noon to three and then q a m's going to

[02:01:15.560 --> 02:01:19.240]
have some new bogus sports show from noon to three which they want to tell anybody about maybe

[02:01:19.240 --> 02:01:23.340]
they still don't know about themselves because they're just a bunch of fools and asses in the woods

[02:01:24.340 --> 02:01:27.740]
and so we are going to have a new nighttime guy sometime very soon

[02:01:29.240 --> 02:01:37.000]
not necessarily monday but very soon a new nighttime person and actually if he's any good he probably

[02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:41.560]
ought to get a 20 share in there at night see there there's nothing else on there is no nighttime

[02:01:41.560 --> 02:01:46.040]

[02:11:08.220 --> 02:11:15.040]
feel after 20 years to be going to a real studio oh god unbelievable and I was on your show once

[02:11:15.040 --> 02:11:20.960]
a j from the jane Scotchow yeah all the way back when you're at wins yeah and I said man this is it

[02:11:20.960 --> 02:11:25.020]
we're just trying to break into the business that wasn't a bad studio no it wasn't too bad it was

[02:11:25.020 --> 02:11:28.680]
pretty good stuff but that was brand new compared to what you're in now yeah see the problem is

[02:11:28.680 --> 02:11:32.620]
we got a nice board here but everything else that we got along with the DCS this computer thing we

[02:11:32.620 --> 02:11:37.960]
got's a piece of crap the car machines are from before between was born uh and it's it's a joke

[02:11:37.960 --> 02:11:42.180]
and it's just all state here stagnating and falling apart and they have refused to lift a finger to

[02:11:42.180 --> 02:11:47.040]
it's like we're supposed to come in here and make magic like the miraculously and don't bother them

[02:11:47.040 --> 02:11:53.220]
all right it makes me and Bob Green says it's a management intensive uh I don't know where's the

[02:11:53.220 --> 02:11:58.440]
intensive manager where's the involvement right they just don't want the problems okay they don't

[02:11:58.440 --> 02:12:01.980]
want problems they don't want phone calls they don't want people bothering them threatening them

[02:12:01.980 --> 02:12:06.980]
they they just like uh turning out the slush like on the coast in hot 105 that's up their alley that's

[02:12:06.980 --> 02:12:11.680]
their speed speaking of the coast this guy calls my house the other to ask for my wife and I'm like

[02:12:11.680 --> 02:12:16.840]
wonder who it is and it gets on the phone yeah this was Jonny dark and he was going to he center

[02:12:16.840 --> 02:12:21.840]
a autograph picture and she asked her you know do you know who I am and she looked at me like

[02:12:21.840 --> 02:12:28.200]
so I guess that's how they're trying to get listeners now they just calling lady they just

[02:12:28.200 --> 02:12:33.320]
called out the phone book some believable yeah and closing the brain stem was on with Roy

[02:12:43.620 --> 02:12:47.000]
he's a better and you know something that's why we're glad we got JJ because he

[02:12:47.760 --> 02:12:51.420]
don't count on Bernie to win any game for us because it's not going to happen didn't it seem

[02:12:51.420 --> 02:12:56.300]
like when buyers complained after not getting one pass and that game that was kind of that was it

[02:12:56.300 --> 02:13:01.080]
yeah see a key see I like I like this and he's not going to put up with any bull crap you don't want

on Sunday we got the move to our new studio Monday or Tuesday I mean this is so intensive

[02:13:25.880 --> 02:13:30.080]
but at least we're getting away from the Cox people those people are assholes and you can tell

[02:13:30.080 --> 02:13:35.720]
him I said so Johnny says so here's the North Miami hello hi Neil yes sir

[02:13:36.180 --> 02:13:41.460]
Neil I think it's time to drive a stake through Jerry Jones's heart okay I think it sounds good to me

[02:13:41.460 --> 02:13:45.980]
I and I'd like to do it did you hear what he said on Monday night football the other night no I did not

[02:13:45.980 --> 02:13:51.060]
he said Michael Irving has completed his 800 hours of community service now do a little

[02:13:51.060 --> 02:13:56.480]
ristening with me will you there's 30 days to almost except the goddamn 31 days with September

[02:13:56.480 --> 02:14:02.800]
30 days right yeah 24 hours to a day the whole time equal that's 720 hours yeah I think he's got

[02:14:02.800 --> 02:14:08.900]
80 more hours no he's been working on stopping overtime some days he did double duty that's right

[02:14:08.900 --> 02:14:14.900]
so to speak unbelievable exactly and I got a gun to my head you know why I'm a die hard

[02:14:14.900 --> 02:14:21.420]
a evils fan they just signed Mark Ripon well it's now let's see we had the deal Seattle traded

[02:14:22.600 --> 02:14:28.660]
the girl a mirror from Notre Dame Rick Myrer to Atlanta for Jeff George which is

[02:14:28.660 --> 02:14:34.380]
yeah that's what I heard this morning oh and you guys picked up Ripon because your guy got

[02:14:34.380 --> 02:14:39.620]
injured in the game Monday right and you're all screwed because you got three third burgers there

[02:14:39.620 --> 02:14:44.720]
but what was the last time Ripon played two years ago with the Rams last year awful he was awful

[02:14:44.720 --> 02:14:49.780]
just awful at least get George and for the Eagles for a while now he's yeah he listen Jeff George

[02:14:49.780 --> 02:14:53.420]
they don't want because not only can't he play but he's a big mouth he's trouble right right

[02:14:53.420 --> 02:14:57.040]
and these mark Ripon will stink the joint out but he'll keep his mouth shut and Ray Rose would have

[02:14:57.040 --> 02:15:03.440]
kicked the crap out of that's right oh well and in closing I forgot what I was gonna say okay

[02:15:03.440 --> 02:15:10.000]
box yeah in closing have a great day we have it open line in day 7519 463 I wonder how well what's

[02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:15.020]
his name Harry Callis gonna feel about having him at Philly yeah Harry Callis boy there's a guy

[02:15:15.020 --> 02:15:23.940]
he must have pictures here's plantation hello Neil yes sir about Roberto Alamar yes what we

[02:15:23.940 --> 02:15:30.900]
course do the players have the umpires are blowing the calls none none what do you mean what do you

[02:15:30.900 --> 02:15:35.960]
mean if they're blowing the calls you know there were there I was watching all parts of all

[02:15:35.960 --> 02:15:41.080]
yesterday's game games okay the three games right there were calls that were made on pitches there

[02:15:41.080 --> 02:15:46.500]
was one pitch in particular in the Yankee Texas game that was so low on outside that it I mean it

[02:15:46.500 --> 02:15:50.980]
was like it was it never was a strike you know I mean other words from the moment the pitcher let it

[02:15:50.980 --> 02:15:55.820]
go it was low on outside and it kept getting more low and further outside and this is a strike

[02:15:56.840 --> 02:16:02.760]
yeah it's it's unbelievable the stuff that they're calling yeah it's in addition in addition to

[02:16:02.760 --> 02:16:07.440]
which did you see in the Yankee game uh part of it did you see the disputed play where the guy

[02:16:07.440 --> 02:16:13.380]
ran inside the baseline now I'm rude I'm rude I'm rude I'm rude against the Yankees okay yeah and

[02:16:13.380 --> 02:16:19.460]
I'm hoping Texas way but in all fairness this guy was inside the baseline all the way down first

[02:16:19.460 --> 02:16:24.580]
base he you can't do that it's interference that's why the throw got by the first baseman and the

[02:16:24.580 --> 02:16:27.900]
Yankees are screaming in howlin and they don't reverse the call they got it wrong again that's

[02:16:27.900 --> 02:16:35.960]
right and and it just seems like the umpire a totally arbitrary what they call the strike zone and

[02:16:35.960 --> 02:16:41.680]
you know since they became unionized it's like nobody nobody can get fired the good old boy network

[02:16:41.680 --> 02:16:50.240]
it's just like I think it's NFL when they get the referees are now unionized so nobody gets fired

[02:16:50.240 --> 02:16:54.940]
nobody gets let go yeah yeah and then they make apologies when they blow a call like they did in

[02:16:54.940 --> 02:16:59.280]
the jets Washington game on Sunday the league apologizes and says oh yeah we blew it it's a

[02:16:59.280 --> 02:17:05.020]
high-imidey thing yeah and I'm going to tell you another thing too about the NFL the fact that they

[02:17:05.020 --> 02:17:09.140]
have eliminated the replay the instant replay is so grotesque and you know they hit the experiment

[02:17:09.140 --> 02:17:13.820]
in preseason where you had a couple of uh replays the coach had a choice right but the fact that

[02:17:13.820 --> 02:17:19.480]
they've taken a replay out means the game is a mockery and that games can be decided now by horrendous

[02:17:19.480 --> 02:17:24.040]
grotesque calls where the officials get together and they have this big long conference for like five

[02:17:24.040 --> 02:17:28.200]
minutes after the play is over well what's there to talk about you know either you saw it or you

[02:17:28.200 --> 02:17:32.620]
didn't see it at least if you got the replay okay here take a look either it was a touchdown or it

[02:17:32.620 --> 02:17:38.360]
wasn't he was in bounds or whatever the dispute is okay I don't care how much longer the game has to be

[02:17:38.360 --> 02:17:44.520]
but at least get it right it just seemed like when they had that replay and I'm all four two but it

[02:17:44.640 --> 02:17:49.080]
took like 15 minutes yeah but then that's because they didn't have the balls what they should do is

[02:17:49.080 --> 02:17:53.660]
have a special like they do in hockey you get the replay officials up there who take a look at it

[02:17:53.660 --> 02:17:59.000]
they make the decision they phone it down to the referee in charge and that's it by the way there

[02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:05.320]
was another athlete who spit actually spit on another opponent that was even a stasi right that's

[02:18:05.320 --> 02:18:12.880]
right that was the years ago on the US Open and by the way Rick and Sud morning afternoon I can't

more chance to prove to the public that you're not going to be a wimp you're not going to sit back

[02:19:02.900 --> 02:19:06.360]
you're not going to take a lot of crap you're not going to wait to rest of your life for somebody to

[02:19:06.360 --> 02:19:10.600]
give you a job that's never coming that you're not going to take crap from a bunch of a third

[02:19:10.600 --> 02:19:14.700]
burgers you're going to tell it exactly the way it is and you're going to start striking back

[02:19:14.700 --> 02:19:21.700]
like a man like this guy says be a man for Cran out loud here's big pine key hello

[02:19:21.700 --> 02:19:27.580]
hey Neil yes sir so much to say so little time to say you got some time but first of all

[02:19:28.200 --> 02:19:35.080]
we have TCI down here that's all we have sorry keys which is a wonderful thing so I called them up

[02:19:35.080 --> 02:19:41.320]
and they gave me an 800 number yeah yeah yeah we already had that okay you have we got 400

[02:19:41.320 --> 02:19:47.060]
numbers okay just keep calling all the numbers it down here we're we're trying to call them up

[02:19:47.060 --> 02:19:53.140]
people who advertise with TCI and tell them we're going to stop buying their product the little

[02:19:53.140 --> 02:19:58.060]
now that that's your spending your wheels there yeah everything's spinning the wheels well

[02:19:58.060 --> 02:20:04.300]
just keep making a calls man yep okay hang in there all right okay see you hear that the

[02:20:04.300 --> 02:20:08.680]
fetus tone and a lot of these people's voices because all all one of these telephone operators has

[02:20:08.680 --> 02:20:12.980]
to do is say well I can go get it this you know something like that or just acting different

[02:20:12.980 --> 02:20:16.320]
and then that's the end of it they give up they throw it at all that's what they're hoping for

[02:20:16.320 --> 02:20:21.720]
because they don't want to give you something for nothing they want to force you to pay extra for it

[02:20:22.540 --> 02:20:26.560]
and they claim they don't want to take something else off of there because they claim that only a very

[02:20:26.560 --> 02:20:31.500]
small number of people want sports channel Florida which means not only the Panthers it means the

[02:20:31.500 --> 02:20:36.460]
Marlins next season with Joangel and Dave O'Brien with somebody might want to watch that it means the

[02:20:36.460 --> 02:20:41.800]
the J.J. show the Danny Boy Show it means all kinds of sporting shows having new with our local

[02:20:41.800 --> 02:20:47.840]

there are a hell of a lot of people down here that are going to want it but hey don't confuse them
