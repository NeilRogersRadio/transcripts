[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]
Why there you best digs

[00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.220]
That's real

[00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.320]
Rogers is like a boy guy

[00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:08.000]
He's foreign

[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.940]
A. P. S. to the swish and decide

[00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.380]
Smoke a good stove and ride around in the vet

[00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:18.160]
You got a radio show you just for the chat

[00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.460]
Happy anniversary to me

[00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:29.260]
The only thing in this town that's real

[00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:32.860]
is the sound of the wind

[00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.560]
The only fall is the smile around

[00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.200]
Just to hear that famous farting sound

[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.060]
The only act can't die

[00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:42.940]
Take the bread off your sandwich

[00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.360]
And like a bonus, it's to marry Mandage

[00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.840]
Me, Rogers, you're the best

[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:52.760]
Oh

[00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.180]
You really put my hand me to the test

[00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.720]
Me, Rogers, always good to know you're there

[00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.280]
Me, Rogers, you're a blind guy, it's too late

[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.980]
Me, Rogers, the only thing I miss when I go

[00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:26.240]
I went away for a week and decided to have fun and blows

[00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.240]
But happy anniversary, Neil always loves your show

[00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.900]
Yeah

[00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.240]
Well, there she is

[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.360]
Hi, sweetheart

[00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.480]
Happy anniversary

[00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:44.540]
Thanks, Randy

[00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:45.280]
That's amazing

[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.820]
Is this Randy Roach or Ellie Brecker?

[00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:47.240]
Come on

[00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.620]
Tell me the real story

[00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:49.820]
She loved you

[00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.040]
Tell me what the two of you have gone

[00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.080]
Well, you know, I thought it was time she should do the story

[00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.900]
She, you know, she just, she loves you, what can I tell you?

[00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.280]
I know that, but she loves my mom's Mondel bread better

[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.380]
Now she likes the strutal

[00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:03.060]
And the strutal

[00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.240]
Yeah, she was big into Millie, she really was

[00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.560]
Yeah

[00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.540]
I think she's gonna write a book about her

[00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.060]
No, Millie's gonna write a book about her

[00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.040]
She's touching already

[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.240]
Wow, why did she write this?

[00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.020]
And I didn't say that, and she made me sound like an old bitch

[00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.840]
And I said, yeah

[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.860]
Oh, come on, I thought that was a nice little touch then

[00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:18.920]
Yeah, a little touch

[00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.100]
Yeah, so how you doing up there, boy, Gary, by the way, called me yesterday

[00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.420]
And he said, tell Randy, don't worry about making that video

[00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.580]
Because she won't be here anyway

[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.840]
Is it my life a living hell?

[00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.220]
Boy, oh boy, what comes around, that goes around

[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.400]
Is he really coming back?

[00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.680]
Huh?

[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.520]
There?

[00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.340]
Talk to you, Daly, he's got nothing to lose

[00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.340]
Let me put it that way

[00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.220]
No, seriously, is he gonna really

[00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.980]
That's what I got to tell you

[00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:43.620]
Oh, okay

[00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:44.380]
And I'm saying?

[00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:44.980]
Yeah

[00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:46.660]
Okay, whatever you say

[00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.320]
So, talk to you, Daly, I'll tell you every day

[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.760]
Well, I'm sure glad they put that ravishing picture of you in my article there, that was lovely

[00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:53.700]
Did you get that?

[00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:55.440]
Did I get what?

[00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:56.900]
Well, I said to you

[00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:57.860]
About what?

[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.120]
About people were calling me going, I can't tell if you like him or not

[00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:05.780]
And I said, I love him

[00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:06.200]
Yeah

[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.700]
But what was that about the ticket taker at Neverland?

[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:10.160]
What the hell was that?

[00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.160]
And why some kind of a child molester now or what?

[00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:13.160]
What does that mean?

[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.820]
It meant that I know how you feel about religion

[00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.520]
I said you had a lucrative career as a televanjulist, right?

[00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.980]
Yeah

[00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.200]
Because you love religion

[00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.980]
And that, and I also know how you feel about little Mikey there

[00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.200]
Also, I thought that you would get it

[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.020]
I got that

[00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:33.180]
Whatever you say, okay

[00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.040]
We're still trying to figure it out

[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.760]
Well, whatever

[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.080]
So when are you gonna go to Vegas, take little more green there with ya

[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.720]
Yeah

[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:40.920]
Give him a little massage

[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.340]
You know, I'm talking about it

[00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.040]
And I'll come back and give you some night numbers

[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.160]
He's not going with us

[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.560]
Huh?

[00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:46.660]
He's not going

[00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.620]
No, take him there, put him on the little bike

[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.260]
I'm not gonna put him on the bike

[00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:08.260]

[00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:08.260]

[00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:08.260]

[00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:08.260]

[00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:08.260]

[00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:08.360]
I'm not gonna put him on the bike

[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.680]
I'm not gonna put him on the bike

[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:09.000]
I'm not gonna put him on the bike

[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.980]
I'm not gonna put him on the bike

[00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:10.800]
I'm not gonna put him on the bike

[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:11.440]
I'm not gonna put him on the bike

[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.600]
I'm not gonna put him on the bike

[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:12.840]
I'm not gonna put him on the bike

[00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.480]
I'm not gonna put him on the bike

[00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:14.660]
I'm not gonna put him on the bike

[00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:15.380]
I'm not gonna put him on the bike

[00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:16.800]
I'm not gonna put him on the bike

[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:17.720]
I'm not gonna put him on the bike

[00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:18.600]
I'm not gonna put him on the bike

[00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.220]
I'm not gonna put him on the bike

[00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:24.260]
I'm not gonna put him on the bike

[00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.260]

[00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.280]
I'm not gonna put him on the bike

[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:24.280]

[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:24.780]
I'm not gonna put him on the bike

[00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:24.780]

[00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:25.240]
I'm not gonna put him on the bike

[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.700]
I'm not gonna put him on the bike

[00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:26.260]
I'm not gonna put him on the bike

[00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:27.340]
I'm not gonna put him on the bike

[00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.960]
I'm not gonna put him on the bike

[00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.160]
I'm not gonna put him on the bike

[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.820]
I'm not gonna put him on the bike

[00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:34.580]
I'm not gonna put him on the bike

[00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.180]
I'm not gonna put him on the bike

[00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.280]
I'm not gonna put him on the bike

[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.840]
I'm not gonna put him on the bike

[00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.420]
I'm not gonna put him on the bike

[00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:48.480]
I'm not gonna put him on the bike

[00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.300]
There you go, Randy Rhodes

[00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.980]
Noon to 3WJNO, 1230 on your AM dial

[00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:54.600]
Let's promote everybody else's show

[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.020]
That's one thing I've always done for years

[00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.200]
I'm not paranoid like those little butt suckers

[00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.440]
Over there at QAM who dump everybody else's name

[00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.380]
Because they're a bunch of paranoid little torps

[00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:03.260]
What are they worried about?

[00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:04.200]
They've been sold anyway

[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.600]
So what are they worried about?

[00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:06.560]
What are they got to lose?

[00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.580]
In fact, if they would start mentioning our names

[00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.900]
They might get an audience over there, but I doubt it

[00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.560]
Look at this, this is beautiful

[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.280]
It's a picture of a hippopotamus

[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.440]
And it says no solomente Hank Goldberg

[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.000]
Tom Biennes and the hippopotamus

[00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:19.560]
You see that? That's cute

[00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:20.660]
And that's Baniolnolus

[00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:22.620]
And by the way, if you're going by the airport

[00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:23.380]
Oh, I'm sorry

[00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.040]
Look at all these cute faxes

[00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:27.920]
There's one from my dentist, thanks Gary

[00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:30.940]
And it was one here from Mark Tadino

[00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:31.680]
Now there's a guy

[00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.640]
If we can't get JC in here, how about Mark Tadino

[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:35.460]
Let's see what he's got

[00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:36.560]
I love you Mark

[00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:38.280]
Man, why ever

[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:39.660]
Well, more so years ago

[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.660]
All kinds of good stuff in here

[00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.780]
Thanks to Sarah inside the building

[00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:44.540]
They got balloons

[00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:45.700]
They got a big thing on here

[00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.640]
The only problem is you know Norberto

[00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:49.960]
Who just came off the banana boat 20 or 30 years ago

[00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:53.240]
They haven't always put up the marquee signs in front

[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.500]
And I drive up to work this morning

[00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.720]
It says, Neil, thanks for 20 years of

[00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.560]
And it's supposed to say

[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:01.000]
Oy

[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.820]
And he put a J in front of the

[00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:03.300]
Oy

[00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:04.620]
How do you like that?

[00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:09.100]
Because the Cubans, the Hispanics, they don't pronounce the J, it's always silent

[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:12.680]
Isn't that what it was supposed to say?

[00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:13.640]
Thanks for 20 years of

[00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:14.120]
Oy

[00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:15.040]
But hey

[00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:16.420]
So that's cute

[00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:17.120]
Thanks to everybody

[00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:17.960]
Thanks Sarah

[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.160]
What she just saying

[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:20.200]
She said blow it out your ass

[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:20.800]
Probably

[00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:22.680]
Something like that

[00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:23.100]
Now it's cute

[00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:23.660]
We got balloons

[00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:26.360]
We got the helium ones which are my taking out their head of that little one

[00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.040]
Bob Green is in there all turned up

[00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.160]
Which means he's probably playing celebrity golf again out there

[00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:32.100]
And here we are

[00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:33.380]
20 years later

[00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:35.940]
You'll never make it six months in his town, man

[00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:37.400]
You'll never make it six months

[00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:38.300]
Let me say it again

[00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:41.100]
That man is dead, dead, dead

[00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:44.040]
It gives me so much joy to know that

[00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:48.140]
That collar, that particular one, along with many others by the way from the K-18 days

[00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:50.980]
But that one in particular, you know he's dead

[00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:54.120]
There's not even a little tiny bit of flesh left on those bones

[00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:56.100]
Even the worms are ignoring him now

[00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:56.720]
How do you like that?

[00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.880]
Even the worst maggots and faggots are ignoring his little bony ass

[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:02.540]
Because there's nothing left, not even a strip of flesh

[00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:03.540]
He's dead!

[00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:05.260]
And I'm still here 20 years later

[00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:06.060]
How do you like that?

[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:07.920]
Unbelievable

[00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:11.280]
So this is really a very emotional day

[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:12.060]
And if you believe that

[00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:15.800]
I told you if you just pump this, if you start about six months ahead, it's kind of like our vagus trip

[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:17.260]
We've started many, many months ahead

[00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:21.020]
And you really just pump it and pump it and pump it and push it and plug it

[00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:23.620]
And look at those brow lines going out there and I was we speak

[00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:24.180]
That's okay

[00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:27.480]
That lucky pitamizes what I was saying yesterday, that's like part of it

[00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:29.600]
And by the way, how about that game last night, huh?

[00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:30.960]
That was pretty weak

[00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:32.920]
Pretty bad officiating

[00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:35.320]
Pretty weak effort all the way around it was ponderous

[00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:38.940]
If that game could have gotten any longer, I would just be coming in from the game right now

[00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:45.800]
That was the slowest the most monotonous in addition to a just deadhead crowd with about 2500 empty seats

[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.060]
It was one of those things

[00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:48.320]
We'll take the point though, thank you

[00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:48.840]
That's alright

[00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:51.380]

[00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:52.860]

If you haven't been listening to Defoe's new Saturday morning show

[00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:57.300]
You've missed BBK

[00:07:57.940 --> 00:07:59.280]
You missed Jessica Geary

[00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:02.440]

[00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:37.520]
Oh my God!

[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:42.880]
You know, and I just heard you just been saying wonderful things about me.

[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.160]
I haven't heard them myself.

[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:45.340]
Oh thank God for that.

[00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:46.420]
Yeah.

[00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:50.240]
Oh my God.

[00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:50.820]
Uh oh.

[00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:52.760]
It's like when you know how any have a bird call.

[00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:00.480]
No seriously, you know how you have a bird call and then all of a sudden the bird shows

[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:00.720]
up.

[00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:01.560]
It flies out in a way.

[00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:02.780]
It just flies in the woods.

[00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:05.720]
It lands on your arm on your sleeve and then drops a little number on you.

[00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:07.360]
How you been Glenn?

[00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:08.880]
Well I feel pretty good.

[00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:10.460]
Yeah, you look pretty good.

[00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:13.500]
You look older like all the rest of us but generally the same.

[00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:14.420]
I got too much sun.

[00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:17.300]
I went swimming the other day but it was wonderful.

[00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:20.000]
So it's so amazing to be down here in South Florida.

[00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:23.080]
Well, I must tell you, I was a...

[00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:24.200]
This can't be happening.

[00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:24.840]
Driving down.

[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.280]
I had some business to do in Fort Loderdice day so I'm driving down to Miami and I'm on

[00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:32.120]
the 70 and I should be cause we had it was hot yesterday.

[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:33.360]
Let me ask you, you do traffic?

[00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:43.020]
It was hot yesterday and so I was thirsty and I just flew into Flores to get something

[00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:43.460]
to drink.

[00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:44.140]
Yeah.

[00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:45.060]
I saw Flores.

[00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:46.280]
That's the place you need to go.

[00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:46.980]
Now when was this?

[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:48.480]
Yesterday afternoon.

[00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:49.160]
You came in yesterday?

[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:49.900]
Uh huh.

[00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:55.560]
And I walked up to the guy standing and walked up to the guy behind the counter and he

[00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:58.380]
looks at me and he says, you're Glenn, aren't you?

[00:10:58.380 --> 00:10:59.860]
I said, wow.

[00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:03.480]
He says, I heard your cackle today on Neil's show.

[00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:08.240]
I don't know if that was the one or not.

[00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:09.820]
He's like every other bird.

[00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:12.340]
He leaves his trademark behind like I said on your sleeve.

[00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:14.400]
Do you know what the significance of yesterday?

[00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:17.100]
Are you showing up in town yesterday?

[00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:19.940]
Sonny's market reopened yesterday after a lot of high years.

[00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:21.040]
I thought I didn't know it had been closed.

[00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:21.920]
Sonny has reopened.

[00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:23.220]
I have questions about this.

[00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:25.360]
I want you to answer my questions.

[00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:26.400]
I have about this town.

[00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:28.620]
What happened to the television stations?

[00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:30.240]
I turned on the cable last night.

[00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:31.240]
I don't understand.

[00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:33.700]
NBC is on six.

[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:34.040]
Yeah.

[00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:36.420]
We were the weatherman is on four.

[00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:39.020]
Brian Norcross, the weather fairy is the news fairy now.

[00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:39.920]
Izzy.

[00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:41.000]
What's going on?

[00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:43.100]
Oh, Izzy is my painter.

[00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:47.680]
How come we were the weatherman and Bob Mayor on six?

[00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:48.080]
Yeah.

[00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:48.260]
Yeah.

[00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:51.200]
And how come Kelly Craig blew up like a bullfrog?

[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:52.320]
What's going on?

[00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:53.160]
Have you seen her lately?

[00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:55.520]
Kelly Craig, my good close.

[00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:56.300]
You remember Kelly?

[00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:59.560]
Oh, your good close personal friend Kelly loves me.

[00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:01.180]
Why does she hate you?

[00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:03.880]
I always knew I liked her for some reason.

[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.420]
No, seriously, it looks like somebody stuck a bicycle pump

[00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:08.220]
up a rass and blew her up about 30 pounds.

[00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:10.320]
Come on, Kelly, get on an egg in sweetheart.

[00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:12.520]
When did the stations change again?

[00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:13.360]
By the way, how slim I am.

[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:14.400]
Yes, you are.

[00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:15.940]
Not slim, but comparatively.

[00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:16.640]
Relatively?

[00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:18.800]
Yeah, relatively to the fat old slime that you were.

[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.560]
Well, that's because I stopped eating all those meals

[00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:21.520]
every day where you used to eat.

[00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:22.180]
Oh.

[00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:24.440]
I didn't come to eat lunch.

[00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:25.920]
Oh, well, yeah, well, well, yeah.

[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.560]
Well, that's not the reason I came.

[00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:30.400]
Anyway, I saw the Sun Sentinel article of Symbolca yesterday.

[00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:30.680]
Yeah.

[00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:32.600]
I saw the Sun Sentinel article very nice.

[00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:33.080]
I read it.

[00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:33.760]
You read Boka for what?

[00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:36.000]
I had to see some people in Boka.

[00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:36.260]
Yeah.

[00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:38.320]
And I picked up the paper and I was looking at the article.

[00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:38.780]
I was like, Gary.

[00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:39.380]
No.

[00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:42.040]
And I, and I saw that's the story.

[00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:43.700]
Glenn's going to be doing a JNO.

[00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:44.600]
That's what it is.

[00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:47.520]
And I saw, and I saw my name in the paper.

[00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:48.480]
I thought that was very nice.

[00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:50.320]
I come to town and they put my name in the paper.

[00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.300]
And I love.

[00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:55.320]
I wonder who card of that up.

[00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:56.580]
You know, it's nice and tight that is.

[00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:58.660]
Neil comments on his colleagues.

[00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:00.960]
And then this colleagues comment on Neil

[00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:04.600]
and this great quote from Larry King.

[00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:06.780]
I must say that quote was wonderful.

[00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:07.600]
What did it say?

[00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:08.960]
Neil is the worst.

[00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:11.400]
No, he said, I just Larry King.

[00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:14.000]
And they don't come any better than Neil Rogers.

[00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:14.680]
That's right.

[00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:15.780]
Yeah, I remember.

[00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:16.100]
Yeah.

[00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:17.800]
Why are they right at the end?

[00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:19.020]
He said, don't be 50 dollars.

[00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:22.280]
Well, oh, geez.

[00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:24.560]
Did you hear that in stereo?

[00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:27.780]
Larry King was on Letterman a couple of weeks ago.

[00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:29.520]
This is the most shocking moment of my life.

[00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:31.760]
And they showed a picture.

[00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:36.180]
They took out a picture of Larry King taking at W-I-O-D

[00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:38.420]
in 1963.

[00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:41.560]
I must say frightening.

[00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:42.380]
It was just.

[00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:43.200]
And then they'll do it that.

[00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:44.240]
Ha, ha.

[00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:46.080]
So.

[00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:48.580]
The worst talk radio I've ever heard in my life was on W-O-D.

[00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:51.020]
The worst talk radio I've ever heard in my life was on W-O-D.

[00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:51.420]
Yeah.

[00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:52.840]
Come on, Larry.

[00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:53.900]
Give us a call, will you?

[00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:54.680]
I will, I give it to you.

[00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:55.000]
OK.

[00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:56.820]
I just, he's going to call in.

[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:57.680]
You mark my words.

[00:13:57.680 --> 00:13:58.580]
He will be calling in.

[00:13:58.700 --> 00:13:59.520]
I'd say he's here.

[00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:00.640]
Oh, here's Brett with a whole bunch of stuff.

[00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:03.300]
I wonder if he's got JC locked up inside of that thing.

[00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:04.600]
Can we give another guest for you?

[00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:04.960]
Yeah.

[00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:07.920]
Oh, my God.

[00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:10.460]
Tom Chica, look how fat he got.

[00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:11.220]
How are you doing, Tom?

[00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:13.360]
He's not on the Atkins.

[00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:15.100]
Pull up a seat down here.

[00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:16.000]
Sit down for a second.

[00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:17.320]
We'll see if we can get another lawsuit going.

[00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:19.120]
So look at this.

[00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:20.420]
They're all showing up today.

[00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:22.020]
I wouldn't be surprised if Madeline Muriel

[00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:24.080]
hair shows up, which we'll have to order a double lunch.

[00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:25.460]
Well, we'll pray that she comes.

[00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:26.400]
This is quite a...

[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:27.640]
All right.

[00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:28.780]
Who do we pray to?

[00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:30.080]
Can you believe that?

[00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:31.800]
No, I was surprised coming in.

[00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:32.420]
Surprise.

[00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:33.760]
I'm surprised to see you.

[00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:36.560]
Well, I guess this is a day of surprises.

[00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:37.940]
This is a day of surprise.

[00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:39.400]
Day of total shock.

[00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:41.240]
Almost as shocking as the fact Melissa said,

[00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:42.540]
nice things about me in your newspaper.

[00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:43.440]
I'm nice and nice to meet you.

[00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:44.300]
She loves me.

[00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:44.800]
She does.

[00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:46.100]
She's a nice person.

[00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:47.040]
Yeah, and nice to see you.

[00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:49.060]
And if you just get away from that, God damn super, Dave, man.

[00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:49.460]
That guy.

[00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:51.520]
Do you know that she's a pompano almost every night?

[00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:52.260]
Yeah, I know that.

[00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:55.240]
And by the way, I see that horse that they gave us last week.

[00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:56.300]
Thank God I left early.

[00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:57.700]
I wonder about that.

[00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:59.720]
I said, don't give Neil a horse if you lose your...

[00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:00.580]
Yeah, if you're still running.

[00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:02.720]
Wally is still whipping and hitting me still running.

[00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:04.340]
I spelled my name wrong, Tom, but I still pray.

[00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:04.660]
Oh, well.

[00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:05.360]
You put it in the pit.

[00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:06.700]
No, I come to town.

[00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:08.140]
My name's in your paper, you know?

[00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:08.880]
That's pretty neat.

[00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:11.400]
Not everybody could do that.

[00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:12.900]
He hasn't lost it, folks.

[00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:13.920]
He still hasn't lost it.

[00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:14.920]
All right, let's do a break.

[00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:16.620]
We'll come back to the Glen Hill Polka show.

[00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:18.540]
I have that in there, by the way.

[00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:21.060]
I do have the Glen Hill Polka, which I'm sure you haven't heard in many years.

[00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:22.740]
Any, any, it's in there.

[00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:25.060]
1023 at WIOD.

[00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:28.140]
Use talking entertainment radio.

[00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:31.740]
610, WIOD.

[00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:32.960]
He'll Roger Scott.

[00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:35.140]
Look at that.

[00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:36.440]
I don't even know what I'm doing anymore.

[00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:38.000]
I'm just totally, uh...

[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:43.780]
If you miss the Neil Rogers show yesterday on 610 WIOD, you missed this.

[00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:45.500]
Is this the bird?

[00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:46.020]
Yeah.

[00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:47.060]
Bird, how you doing?

[00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:47.480]
OK.

[00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:52.520]
Listen, do me a favor, play anything, because I can't stand listening to you.

[00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:54.100]
You sound like a douchebag.

[00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:55.120]
Do what?

[00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:56.640]
Just do me a favor, play anything.

[00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:58.600]
Well, can I ask you a question before you go?

[00:15:58.780 --> 00:16:00.680]
Oh, God, you sound so stupid.

[00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:01.820]
I hate to talk to you.

[00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:02.440]
Yeah, go ahead.

[00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:03.620]
Why did you call me?

[00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:04.460]
I didn't call you.

[00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:07.320]
No, no, just to tell you not to say anything.

[00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:08.620]
Just play something.

[00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:11.220]
Oh, God can't stand it.

[00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:12.700]
Well, then why are you listening?

[00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:14.420]
Ah, play something already.

[00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:15.880]
Why won't you answer my...

[00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:17.220]
Oh, God, stand it.

[00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:18.040]
You won't...

[00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:19.160]
See, he won't talk to me.

[00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:20.460]
Oh, we got a car here.

[00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:20.840]
Hello.

[00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:23.700]
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

[00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:24.840]
Well, that's your brain's back.

[00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:25.800]
Some great memories, don't it?

[00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:26.260]
Sure does.

[00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:29.200]
Now, did you say to the bird, let's do that to you all over again.

[00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:30.160]
Let's recreate that.

[00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:32.000]
I wonder if Joey's going to show up here today.

[00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:33.600]
I have my nose up, Neil's ass.

[00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:35.440]
Wouldn't that be something for my 2010 anniversary?

[00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:37.800]
The only thing that would be a big surprise if that guy showed up.

[00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:38.280]
Brian.

[00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:38.740]
Yeah.

[00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:40.200]
Brian was a stooping over a little while.

[00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:41.440]
We had to stand him up straight again.

[00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:43.440]
Brian's a little stooped, but that's where it goes.

[00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:45.980]
Now, Joey is doing an overnight...

[00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:46.840]
Isn't that frightening, yeah?

[00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:48.060]
From the way he sees it.

[00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:49.600]
Nobody carries it down here, do they?

[00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:50.400]
No, God, God, the...

[00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:51.460]
No, he's out of the...

[00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:52.280]
The way he goes, Stan.

[00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:53.200]
Yeah.

[00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:54.520]
He's out of W.O.R.

[00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:55.380]
Now, does Stan...

[00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:56.400]
He's out of W.O.R.

[00:16:56.460 --> 00:16:57.460]
Yeah, that was from A.B.C.

[00:16:57.520 --> 00:16:58.300]
No, it's O.R.

[00:16:58.420 --> 00:16:58.980]
Oh, I don't wonder.

[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:01.320]
It's like the one you're on after before Arlene Francis.

[00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:02.980]
He's on like one to five in the morning.

[00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:04.980]
And does Stan do his show out of his house?

[00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:07.320]
No, that's like out of an orifice.

[00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:08.960]
Oh!

[00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:09.860]
Literally.

[00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:11.680]
Yeah, somewhere in Carl Springs, I think.

[00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:12.160]
Yeah.

[00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:15.760]
And he's got some other ultra right wing Nazi on there,

[00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:17.660]
doing some other show out of that same studio.

[00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:18.240]
Oh, yeah?

[00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:21.680]
So, listen, but now I know it.

[00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:22.340]
I'm ahead of you guys.

[00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:24.000]
Stan's coming in today with a two grand.

[00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:24.640]
All right.

[00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:25.680]
I know it.

[00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:28.700]
I knew he was just waiting for the appropriate day.

[00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:30.460]
Thank God, Stan's asleep as we speak.

[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:32.420]
And by the way, of people who are like down and out

[00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:35.400]
of their luck, you know our good friend, Captain Dave?

[00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:36.420]
Yeah, where is he?

[00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:38.220]
He hasn't called you?

[00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:39.740]
Can you believe it?

[00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:40.880]
I heard he was in the house.

[00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:41.600]
Well, I know your number.

[00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:43.520]
You heard what he's in town?

[00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:44.060]
California.

[00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:44.720]
California.

[00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:47.500]
And he called about two weeks ago on year one day

[00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:51.180]
and just out of the blue and talking about his struggling

[00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:53.620]
non-careers and actor and seeking his fortune

[00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:54.280]
and all this other.

[00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:57.460]
And I just had a premonition that because he was calling

[00:17:57.460 --> 00:17:59.500]
on year that I might just get a call at home.

[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.980]
And sure enough, I got home and there was a desperate call

[00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:02.580]
on my machine.

[00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:04.500]
What do you think he wanted?

[00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:04.940]

[00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:06.960]
He was sending money.

[00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:08.000]
Well, I see you say that.

[00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:09.020]
It sounds so insensitive.

[00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:10.420]
He said, don't be 50 dollars.

[00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:10.840]
Yeah.

[00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:14.660]
And it was, we have another gas.

[00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:16.440]
And I said, I've had so many bad experiences.

[00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:17.660]
All I can say is, no.

[00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:21.000]
Henry Barrow is here with a little something

[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.700]
with a bottle of booze.

[00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:24.760]
You notice how he keeps the decanter with him

[00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:25.380]
at all times?

[00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:26.660]
Oh my God.

[00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:28.280]
Henry, how you doing?

[00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:31.180]
That was a quick, were you really over there?

[00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:32.480]
My, my, my, my, my, my, was on a phone.

[00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:33.260]
It was that just a taste.

[00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:37.480]
Thanks for ever to get that taste and smell out of your system.

[00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:38.040]
Unbelievable.

[00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:40.400]
The great Henry Barrow who has an age of 20 years.

[00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:41.660]
30 years since he got out of here.

[00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:42.140]
Is back.

[00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:42.800]
That's right.

[00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:43.320]
Yeah.

[00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:44.220]
I'm great.

[00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:46.800]
So you're doing the dolphin games this year again, huh?

[00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:47.200]
Oh, really?

[00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:48.120]
Back on the sideline.

[00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:48.460]
Yeah.

[00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:49.480]
That's the room with that I hear.

[00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:51.440]
I hear they're going to Waxie.

[00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:52.840]
I just want to run here.

[00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:53.720]
I said in Henry Barrow.

[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.880]
That'd be good because they hate us like poison.

[00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:57.160]
Wake us up once in a while.

[00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:57.520]
Yeah.

[00:18:58.560 --> 00:18:59.440]
So now let's see.

[00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:01.580]
Are you and Mikey both drinking out of that same flask

[00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:02.820]
or is that just personal?

[00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:04.820]
No, we have wine at nine every day.

[00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:05.300]
Yeah.

[00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:06.080]
Yeah.

[00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:07.580]
Uh-huh.

[00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:10.180]
And why don't participate in that either?

[00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:10.500]
It doesn't.

[00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:12.420]
We have a separate bottle for you.

[00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:12.640]
Yeah.

[00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:12.800]
Good.

[00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:13.680]
That's great.

[00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:15.520]
He's probably going to call you again.

[00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:16.900]
He's driving and listening right now.

[00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:17.000]
Yeah.

[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:17.820]
Who's going to get out of the keys?

[00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:18.820]
Michael or Harrison?

[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:19.540]
One of those guys.

[00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:20.080]
One of those guys.

[00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:21.440]
Well, that would be great.

[00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:22.780]
Can you believe that he's here?

[00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:23.280]
Yeah.

[00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:24.320]
I heard that coming in.

[00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:24.740]
It's shocking.

[00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:25.600]
It's shocking.

[00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:25.820]

[00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:26.340]
Yeah.

[00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:28.760]
Now who's bringing a food here by the way, George?

[00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:32.060]
Is Flores coming by with about we have afforded for people bringing food today?

[00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:32.880]
Oh, great.

[00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:34.540]
I'm not touching any of it by the way.

[00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:36.200]
I'll sit here and watch everybody eat.

[00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:40.120]
You know, the thing you used to say the same thing 10 years ago.

[00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:40.780]
Oh, thanks.

[00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:43.060]
Henry just gave me one of those micro-neurysipositories.

[00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:44.180]
That's a beautiful thing.

[00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:46.140]
That's a little hand roll thing they did over time.

[00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:46.460]
Uh-huh.

[00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:48.860]
Yeah, I bet you they have a lot of hand roll things over there at Waxy.

[00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:49.940]
Well, you're leaving?

[00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:51.140]
A little while.

[00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:52.180]
Oh, come here.

[00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:54.580]
Yeah, we don't want to take away Tom's thunder here.

[00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:55.680]
Tom is looking for an audience.

[00:19:56.020 --> 00:19:56.200]
Yeah.

[00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:58.520]
Are you liking semi-retermine now or what?

[00:19:58.700 --> 00:19:59.320]
What are you talking about?

[00:19:59.440 --> 00:19:59.880]
Oh, no, I'm in.

[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.080]
Three stars in the paper today.

[00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:04.260]
I understand that, but it's just like you're like keeping a low profile.

[00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:05.480]
It used to be all over the place.

[00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:07.060]
No, I'm doing that show tonight.

[00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:10.100]
Like I said, you're keeping a low profile.

[00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:13.800]
Oh, you're filling in for Kaplan.

[00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:15.360]
Don't you wish you were on a station?

[00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:16.640]
No, where somebody could hear you at night?

[00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:19.120]
Well, if you're east of 95, it's fine.

[00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:21.460]
I like the way that Paxton has to have two stations.

[00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:23.100]
Where are this, by the way?

[00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:25.360]
The Paxton has got like the heat.

[00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:27.920]
We're complaining they wanted to drop, but they wanted to get off the station

[00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:30.080]
because they wouldn't put them on the light bulbs.

[00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:33.140]
So now he's on FTL to cover Broward in I&Z to cover day.

[00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:35.480]
Is Pete Bouldier on FTL?

[00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:38.260]
Pete Bouldier is the PD of FTL.

[00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:38.480]
Yeah.

[00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:41.540]
He's gone from Zeta to I&Z to the light bulb.

[00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:42.920]
And he's the program.

[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.000]
And I understand that they have an opening at Piper High next week at KPX.

[00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:47.780]
I think it's a little too upscale for Pete.

[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:48.840]
Rose Folger.

[00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:49.220]
Right.

[00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:51.420]
It's the program director of FTL.

[00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:51.820]
Correct.

[00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:53.740]
Well, it's on now by Paxton Ones.

[00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:54.500]
Paxton Ones.

[00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:55.500]
Paxton Ones everything.

[00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:57.000]
He owns like 500 radio stations.

[00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:57.440]
Oh, yeah.

[00:20:57.720 --> 00:20:58.540]
Up there too.

[00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:00.740]
He just bought two from a Russ in the Oasis.

[00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:03.700]
Russ keeps selling him straight.

[00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:04.660]
He's gonna buy the pantas.

[00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:05.620]
No, he's not.

[00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:07.500]
Wayne will be the owner.

[00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:09.220]
In fact, you should write that in the paper on Monday.

[00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:10.120]
You should be the first guy.

[00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:11.320]
Wayne will be the owner.

[00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:12.120]
Take it to the bank.

[00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:13.780]
What about that?

[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:14.700]
Million four.

[00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:15.600]
He's losing a month.

[00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:18.020]
I think Gary Batman is going to make him an offering.

[00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:18.540]
Can't refuse.

[00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:21.060]
I think the league may just subsidize a little bit of you.

[00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:23.520]
Are you saying, see, I'm out of, I'm like from out of town.

[00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:24.520]
I don't know what you people are talking about.

[00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:25.620]
What do you mean from out of town?

[00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:26.420]
Well, I don't live here anymore.

[00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:28.500]
We were discussing just yesterday on this show.

[00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:32.260]
The house they used to live in in the bird sanctuary around in Kendall.

[00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:33.180]
Sunset.

[00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:33.680]
Still standing.

[00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:34.500]
And buy every day.

[00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:35.220]
Do you?

[00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:36.080]
Do you?

[00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:37.460]
I heard you.

[00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:38.440]
I heard you.

[00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:39.600]
Well, kind of.

[00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:40.820]
How do I put it?

[00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:43.980]
How do I put it when we're on the air?

[00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:45.720]
You got your dump button ready?

[00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:48.660]
Do you go by and, you know, tinkle on the side?

[00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:48.740]

[00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:48.900]
No matter.

[00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:51.180]
In fact, my mother was looking for an apartment in Jerusalem.

[00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:53.500]
She was thinking of moving down and we stopped down.

[00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:54.980]
I said, you know, you still live here and she said, who?

[00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:56.560]
I said to Burr, she said, let's go somewhere else.

[00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:56.860]
Ah!

[00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:00.580]
I just noticed something.

[00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:00.900]
Yeah.

[00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:01.900]
I've been gone, what?

[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:02.580]
Three years.

[00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:03.220]
Almost.

[00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:03.620]
Is it three?

[00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:06.860]
And I would have thought you would have gotten rid of Randy's chair here.

[00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:08.220]
The one with all the stains on it.

[00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:09.960]
Oh, that's a Randy's memorial chair.

[00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:11.180]
It's still here.

[00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:13.420]
And you'd be amazed at what other people have done on that sense.

[00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:16.380]
Are you saying that dolphins are leaving IOD?

[00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:17.000]
Is that what you've been doing?

[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:17.540]
We have one more year.

[00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:19.000]
One more season.

[00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:21.260]
And then you can bet your life that they're leaving.

[00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:23.120]
You can go to the bank on it.

[00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:25.600]
And you think they'll go to the, where do you think they'll go?

[00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:27.500]
I don't know because it's okay.

[00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:29.280]
You see, you see, easily just bought, you're out of the market.

[00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:31.400]
You could easily just bought QAM and the kiss.

[00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:33.980]
And they don't want QAM.

[00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:34.720]
They want to sell it.

[00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:38.080]
I would be surprised if Wayne buys QAM and puts all the sports on there.

[00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:39.280]
Are you hearing that?

[00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:39.820]
Yeah.

[00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:40.880]
I'm hearing that.

[00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:42.240]
It's all sports anyway, isn't it?

[00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:42.760]
No.

[00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:45.340]
Well, alleged besides Lordeislin bought all their 80-fend,

[00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:47.500]
they sports paid an holiday with the station that quickly.

[00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:49.280]
I mean, it was just bought by Beasley.

[00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:50.400]
You're going to move it again that quickly.

[00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:50.820]
Oh, sure.

[00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:52.580]
Don't you know the way it is now?

[00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:53.380]
Like, I see it.

[00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:54.140]
It's like playing cards.

[00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:55.620]
It's like a deck of cards.

[00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:57.100]
This is getting like what's his name show?

[00:22:57.180 --> 00:22:57.820]
The guy from Sanford.

[00:22:57.820 --> 00:22:58.320]
Alex Bennett.

[00:22:58.600 --> 00:22:59.600]
And look what happened to him.

[00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:00.640]
Look what did for him, yeah.

[00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:04.120]
Oh, you were already out of here when Alex Bennett came in.

[00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:05.860]
You see, we did your real favor.

[00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:07.440]
I met him.

[00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:07.920]
Did you?

[00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:08.380]
Oh, yeah.

[00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:09.640]
How did you meet him?

[00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:12.140]
Alex Bennett does that what you said?

[00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:12.360]
Yeah.

[00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:15.760]
Well, he came in, he tried out for that,

[00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:18.680]
and he came in and did your show for a week while you were on vacation.

[00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:22.820]
And I played sidekick.

[00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:24.140]
Did you?

[00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:24.560]
Yeah.

[00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:25.540]
To Alex Bennett?

[00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:28.100]
I swear to God, do you think I'll ever forget it?

[00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:30.440]
You didn't hear it because you were out of town.

[00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:32.400]
Then he got the afternoon show.

[00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:35.200]
And I may have still been here then.

[00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:39.820]
Live from beautiful North Bay Village,

[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.780]
where he was busted by the police department for being a told loser.

[00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:48.040]
It's a salute to Alex Bennett.

[00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:53.620]
The man who constantly exercised his neck by looking over his shoulder.

[00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:56.800]
The man from California who didn't have a tan.

[00:23:57.200 --> 00:24:00.220]
The man who founded Great Punta Rippers fellow workers.

[00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:06.020]
But when ripped himself turned into a smithling, crying, complaining candy ass.

[00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:11.020]
The man who finally showed some semblance of intelligence when he packed his bags

[00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:12.680]
and got the hell out of town.

[00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:16.820]
One of the few men who could actually go back to an old job in an old town,

[00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:20.020]
telling old jokes and doing even older bits.

[00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:22.580]
We salute you, Alex Bennett.

[00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:29.220]
South Florida's never seen a bigger paranoid, a bigger backstabber, a bigger crybaby.

[00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:33.460]
Alex Bennett, you're a complete asshole.

[00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:34.820]
Oh.

[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.180]
I think that might have put him over the edge.

[00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:38.720]
That's promo.

[00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:39.580]
Yeah, that's him.

[00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:42.040]
That's how I'm talking about it.

[00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:42.600]
That's the one.

[00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:43.480]
Well, look at that.

[00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:44.140]
A bunch of cards.

[00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:44.760]
Thank you, Brett.

[00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:45.760]
Where's Jake C?

[00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:46.240]
By the way.

[00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:48.340]
He's probably hiding in a closet somewhere now.

[00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:51.680]
Anyway, Henry, it's nice to see about it.

[00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:54.560]
I thought it was one of the most tasteless things ever seen when you came into the news booth

[00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:55.760]
this morning and said to Meribur.

[00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:57.420]
I have just tasted your snapper.

[00:24:57.680 --> 00:24:59.960]
I thought that was the most gross test tasteless thing.

[00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:03.940]
So to speak, I was trying to think when was the first time I ever met you personally.

[00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:04.380]
Yeah.

[00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:09.400]
And I remembered it was at a Rod McHughan news conference I was sent to cover.

[00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:09.900]
Right.

[00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:11.640]
In which you stole the show.

[00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:13.140]
I did.

[00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:13.560]
Yeah.

[00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:14.800]
By doing what?

[00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:18.000]
He held a news conference before Rod McHughan.

[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:18.260]
Oh.

[00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:19.820]
And chatted with everyone.

[00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:20.660]
I don't even remember that.

[00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:22.800]
By the time Rod McHughan came out, was during the...

[00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:23.860]
A need of Ryan.

[00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:24.180]
Ryan.

[00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:24.860]
Oh.

[00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:26.520]
When you know where it was, it was in that...

[00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:28.400]
It's a fish market now up there on Biscayne.

[00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:29.440]
That's where it was.

[00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:29.840]
Oh, it is.

[00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:30.700]
It's a fish market.

[00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:35.420]
And we had rented that for the meetings of the Dade County fans and whatever it was.

[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:36.400]
Look at what?

[00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:38.380]
That person standing there.

[00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:40.520]
You know that person?

[00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:41.520]
Suds.

[00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:43.080]
I hadn't seen him in a long time.

[00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:43.680]
Yeah.

[00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:44.980]
It was just neat to see him.

[00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:45.280]
Yeah.

[00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:45.960]
That person.

[00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:46.720]
There is.

[00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:47.620]
That person there.

[00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:49.780]
Adam and George and Tom and Dick and Harry.

[00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:50.320]
There you go.

[00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:53.100]
Oh, Tom and Dick are there.

[00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:53.500]
Yeah.

[00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:54.860]
At least Tom.

[00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:56.920]
So anyway, 1037.

[00:25:56.940 --> 00:25:58.040]
Let me do a little bit.

[00:25:58.040 --> 00:25:58.980]
We got a lot of spots here.

[00:25:59.040 --> 00:25:59.240]
Okay.

[00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:00.600]
So don't just dummy up, Clint.

[00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:02.740]
23 to 11 at WID.

[00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:03.740]
What do you...

[00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:05.180]
All over South Florida.

[00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:07.880]
Baseball players are getting ready for the new season.

[00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:09.960]
And so are we.

[00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:12.040]
Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.

[00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:13.800]
March 5th, 6th and 7th.

[00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:19.060]
Talk Marlins baseball with DFO and the Marlins live from spring training on news, talk and

[00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:19.980]
entertain the radio.

[00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:23.220]
610, W-I-O-D.

[00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:25.440]
Yeah, you're right.

[00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:27.340]
It was sad we missed the open at their two barns.

[00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:27.720]
Calm down.

[00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:30.100]
Stew a stick in the open at we should have won at game last night.

[00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:30.980]
But hey, it's one of those things.

[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.200]
We had like two or three hundred people left by the end of the game.

[00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:34.720]
You talk about people leaving early.

[00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:35.340]
Oh, man.

[00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:36.640]
Did they bail out of their last night?

[00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:37.880]
I was about a three and a half hour game.

[00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:38.380]
Huh.

[00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:38.780]
Yeah.

[00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:41.340]
And it was the longest man the officiating was the worst.

[00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:43.000]
And they couldn't get their act together in the lines.

[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.880]
And they wanted to be the stars, not just the referee.

[00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:47.100]
But the linesman wouldn't drop the guy, damn puck.

[00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:49.240]
They would just stand there and like, uh, talk to players.

[00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:50.960]
And then the players would get overanxious.

[00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:52.380]
And then they threw him out of the face off circle.

[00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:54.580]
And they would do it again and again and again.

[00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:56.020]
And it just never stopped.

[00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:59.360]
Well, if they build out in sunrise, you'll be able to look at home between periods and walk the dogs.

[00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:00.160]
Right, exactly.

[00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:03.940]
So anyway, I don't want to talk a bigger part.

[00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:06.020]
I have no idea who that is.

[00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:07.420]
Oh, where's the food?

[00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:09.820]
Yeah, I didn't recognize them either.

[00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:13.280]
Boy, I wouldn't have recognized you for all the teams.

[00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:13.760]
I know.

[00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:14.480]
I had no clue.

[00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:15.260]
Is that incredible?

[00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:17.320]
What is a new look?

[00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:17.800]
Yeah.

[00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:20.360]
I'm wanted in 17 states.

[00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:21.120]
I had to grow up being stuck up.

[00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:22.620]
Yeah, I can imagine that.

[00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:24.560]
Too bad you're not wanted by 17 stations.

[00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:27.580]
But the way it goes.

[00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:30.800]
So you seem to start with that thing about the game because you know him.

[00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:31.940]
I didn't say anything.

[00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:32.480]
I know.

[00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:33.840]
But I was wondering.

[00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:34.840]
See, that's a good thing.

[00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:36.260]
There's no room for your head on the table.

[00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:40.260]
Because he used to put his head down on the table and give her a upset.

[00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:40.680]
I just think...

[00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:42.320]
Now the fact that you know there's four lunches coming in,

[00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:43.580]
that probably makes you feel a little bit better.

[00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:45.720]
Can I take like one or two of these calls?

[00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:47.740]
I don't want to see him rude, but Miami, hello.

[00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:49.280]
Yeah, I'm Neil.

[00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:49.920]
Yes, sir.

[00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:56.100]
I'm calling on behalf of the Spirit Restaurant to congratulate you on your 20 years of heart-yupin torture.

[00:27:56.180 --> 00:27:56.840]
Thank you so much.

[00:27:56.920 --> 00:27:57.700]
What restaurant is that?

[00:27:58.340 --> 00:27:59.460]
The Spirit Restaurant.

[00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:00.120]
The Spirit.

[00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:04.260]
We would like to donate four tickets to the Grand Prix on...

[00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:06.480]
for some lucky listener.

[00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:07.120]
Yeah.

[00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:09.760]
For today's race and tomorrow's race.

[00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:10.780]
And how do they get them?

[00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:14.160]
Well, they can come by the restaurant to the Spirit and pick it up.

[00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:14.940]
And what do they do?

[00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:16.660]
How many meals do they have to buy?

[00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:17.960]
20 or 30?

[00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:18.540]
None.

[00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:19.160]

[00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:21.280]
I bet she gets to give the address now, too.

[00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:22.580]
Oh, of course.

[00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:26.100]
Well, there's nothing like exploiting my anniversary to plug your restaurant.

[00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:26.900]
What's wrong with that?

[00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:28.680]
That's the epitome of this town.

[00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:29.540]
That's what it's all about.

[00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:31.340]
I like it.

[00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:32.660]
Well, we...

[00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:33.940]
I'm a first time caller.

[00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:37.400]
And I've enjoyed your show for years and years.

[00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:38.200]
Well, thank you so much.

[00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:38.860]
Where is this joint?

[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.520]
I mean, where is this great establishment of yours?

[00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:40.960]
Come on.

[00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:45.300]
It's on 836 and the North-West 72nd Avenue.

[00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:46.140]
My very own.

[00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:46.560]
Right.

[00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:48.520]
And Fat Rich knows all about it.

[00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:50.660]
Oh, so Fat Rich puts you up to this, huh?

[00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:51.360]
No, I know.

[00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:51.920]
He didn't.

[00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:52.380]
Sure he did.

[00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:54.900]
You know, he's our computer expert.

[00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:56.740]
Oh, that's what this is all about.

[00:28:56.900 --> 00:28:57.200]
Okay.

[00:28:57.460 --> 00:28:58.200]
That's why we're losing money.

[00:28:58.200 --> 00:28:59.640]
Okay. Great, exactly.

[00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:02.680]
Well, I'll give you some pointers on that later on.

[00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:03.840]
Okay, pal.

[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:04.740]
Good luck to you.

[00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:05.160]
All right.

[00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:05.440]
Okay.

[00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:08.260]
By the way, also anybody wants to drive by the airport

[00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:10.260]
and see any of our friends over there?

[00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:11.900]
What did you say all about that?

[00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:12.560]
What is it?

[00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:13.460]
What about the airport?

[00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:14.160]
I'm sorry.

[00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:15.300]
We have a bunch of...

[00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:17.020]
They call themselves the Cuban youth,

[00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:18.780]
not to be confused with the Buchanan youth.

[00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:19.440]
Oh, boy.

[00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:20.800]
But the Cuban youth,

[00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:23.340]
and they decided that a good way to bring attention to the fact

[00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:25.980]
that we had this unfortunate episode last weekend,

[00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:28.620]
would be to drive very slowly all through the airport.

[00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:29.980]
It might be international, like, yeah.

[00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:31.540]
Just drive around very slowly.

[00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:34.040]
At least it's not laying down in the streets, like we had the last time.

[00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:35.120]
So this is a big improvement.

[00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:36.760]
We're starting to move in the right direction.

[00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:38.420]
I can't believe they're public relations.

[00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:38.880]

[00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:39.460]
Exactly.

[00:29:40.060 --> 00:29:40.860]
How to win friends.

[00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:42.020]
How to win over the community.

[00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:45.040]
Sure understand how to win the rest of the community over to any cause

[00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:48.260]
by getting in everybody's way and getting them pissed off and worked up.

[00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:50.020]
It's only going to be 86 in the shade today.

[00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:51.900]
People are going to be sweating and cursing.

[00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:52.440]
It's the weekend.

[00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:53.500]
They're trying to get out of town.

[00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:54.920]
Trying to catch their plane.

[00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:56.320]
And of course, that's the way.

[00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:57.820]
Now, did you drive down here?

[00:29:57.820 --> 00:29:58.580]
Did you fly in?

[00:29:58.660 --> 00:29:59.800]
I drove down.

[00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:00.780]
I drove down.

[00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:03.400]
Yeah, I had some other stuff to do up in Palm Beach County.

[00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:05.740]
Oh, you are going to J&O.

[00:30:06.860 --> 00:30:07.740]
Good luck to you.

[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:08.920]
Nothing to do with radio.

[00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:10.160]
So I thought I would do this too.

[00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:11.200]
You're not going to J&O.

[00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:13.500]
I thought that would have been the great coup that Boy Gary would have had

[00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:14.600]
is to bring you on a rich area.

[00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:15.440]
It's boy Gary there.

[00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:16.960]
He's starting Monday morning.

[00:30:17.340 --> 00:30:18.540]
He's going to be the beauty of it.

[00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:18.720]
I did not.

[00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:19.600]
And do the morning show.

[00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:20.000]
What?

[00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:20.840]
Yeah.

[00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:23.140]
And the Gregory.

[00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:24.480]
What is he going to do in the morning?

[00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:25.180]
Suck.

[00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:28.420]
And Gregory Benjamin.

[00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:29.180]
What?

[00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:31.180]
Now is moving over to the country.

[00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:33.560]
Country club.

[00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:34.360]
Country club.

[00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:34.360]

[00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:35.300]
Are you at my point for the time?

[00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:37.940]
Of course, you know, that's the reason that nobody knows who you are anymore scholars

[00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:39.240]
because you're always off mic anyway.

[00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:41.900]
Yeah, well, I was just trying to, you know, shout through Tom Jikers head and go.

[00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:44.280]
No, he's trying to do the Dave Capri to style.

[00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:44.720]
That's right.

[00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:45.180]
That's right.

[00:30:45.180 --> 00:30:45.640]
That's right on the floor.

[00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:45.960]
I know.

[00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:47.100]
Who gets here to try it?

[00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:48.840]
That's where you'll find out.

[00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:51.680]
And then in about two weeks we'll get a call for you asking for money.

[00:30:51.860 --> 00:30:52.320]
Now, wait a minute.

[00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:52.540]
Yeah.

[00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:54.760]
Gregory Benjamin is going to play country.

[00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:55.720]
Is that what you're saying?

[00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:56.480]
That's what I'm saying.

[00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:57.300]
This is mine.

[00:30:57.380 --> 00:30:59.940]
And the worst part of it is he finally found a nits theory.

[00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:02.280]
He had like an eight share or something in the morning on J&O.

[00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:02.720]
Yeah.

[00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:04.100]
Only by default, I guess.

[00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:05.400]
But he was doing well.

[00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:08.220]
And now he's going over to the country because Gary Bruce is coming in.

[00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:08.620]
Yeah.

[00:31:08.980 --> 00:31:09.700]
And don't do that.

[00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:13.280]
He can't stand the other assholes who are in management there with whom Gary Bruce will be there.

[00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:15.200]
Is anybody supposed to be hearing you or what?

[00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:17.600]
I'm speaking right into a damn microphone.

[00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:18.040]
Yeah.

[00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:19.000]
Well, it's not turned on.

[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.300]
Maybe that's why you're not on here anymore.

[00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:21.980]
Maybe your voice just doesn't carry, you know?

[00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:22.240]
Oh.

[00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:25.160]
He's got the microphone all the way down his throat and he still can't hear him.

[00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:30.100]
Just want to say that Gary Bruce will fit in perfectly with the other ideas of this assholes at WJ&O.

[00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:30.580]
Thank you.

[00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:32.300]
You know what we have to play now.

[00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:35.240]
What the hell was that name of that thing that you did?

[00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:36.020]
Oh, the thing.

[00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:37.700]
Well, there were two of them.

[00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:38.560]
Could you be more vague?

[00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:40.060]
No, the one-y, twenty years.

[00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:41.400]
No, no, no, no, no, no.

[00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:42.300]
I'm not talking about that.

[00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:43.360]
First, there was...

[00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:45.700]
Oh, yeah.

[00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:51.280]
Oh, yeah.

[00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:54.500]
What?

[00:31:54.620 --> 00:31:55.700]
Nobody's going to talk this up?

[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:56.680]
I don't think so.

[00:31:57.160 --> 00:31:58.020]
Jeez, I'm offended.

[00:31:58.680 --> 00:31:59.680]
I'm going home now.

[00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:00.120]
Oh, step on it.

[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:02.320]
Wow.

[00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:06.580]
Has he still got it or what?

[00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:07.400]
I hope so.

[00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:08.420]
But the...

[00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:09.000]
I can't give it away.

[00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:09.540]
That's the problem.

[00:32:09.580 --> 00:32:10.160]
No, but wait a minute.

[00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:11.400]
Here it is.

[00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:12.800]
This is the one that was the award winner.

[00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:14.740]
So I, way, yeah.

[00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:17.560]
Where it's supposed to fill salt might I call any second now.

[00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:19.760]
On food is here, we want to think,

[00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:21.480]
boon again profusely.

[00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:25.020]
There's enough food here to feed the Chinese army.

[00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:26.800]
Fine.

[00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:28.180]
Why?

[00:32:32.140 --> 00:32:34.420]
One open line in date and one in brown.

[00:32:35.540 --> 00:32:35.700]
Hmm.

[00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:37.300]
Hmm.

[00:32:37.620 --> 00:32:37.740]
Hmm.

[00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:38.400]
Boy, this is good.

[00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:40.020]
Why?

[00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:43.200]
Why are you laughing at?

[00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:44.120]
Nothing.

[00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:45.640]
Everything's fine.

[00:32:45.780 --> 00:32:46.660]
I'm just sitting here.

[00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:48.200]
And you're over there, can't quite.

[00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:50.500]
Let me call it what's right about you.

[00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:52.220]
Just relax.

[00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:54.320]
What, bird?

[00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:58.240]
Here, give me your finger.

[00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:01.940]
Now stick your finger in this piece of pita bread, okay?

[00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:02.540]
Okay.

[00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:06.020]
I guess some of the food is arrived anyway.

[00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:07.560]
I think you're right.

[00:33:09.340 --> 00:33:09.560]
Hmm.

[00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:11.800]
Thanks, J.C.

[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:13.760]
Man, don't stay way too long.

[00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:17.580]
I just bit your finger off and you're still laughing.

[00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:21.260]
Hmm.

[00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:22.840]
You know what?

[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:23.740]
It's not bad.

[00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:25.860]
You got nine more of these, right?

[00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:26.360]
Yes.

[00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:28.900]
Put a little melt of mozzarella on this

[00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:29.860]
and you really got something.

[00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:33.220]
And it's okay any act is to it's what I understand.

[00:33:33.420 --> 00:33:33.620]
Oh, good.

[00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:36.460]
That may have been the best thing Skyler ever did.

[00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:37.800]
I think so, I think right there.

[00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:38.840]
But then it was...

[00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:40.340]
There was always Yarniel.

[00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:43.560]
Yeah, well that's kind of a different genre.

[00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:43.960]
Yeah.

[00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:46.300]
They can play the CDs if they want to hear that one.

[00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:47.140]
So that's old.

[00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:48.080]
Oh, look at that.

[00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:50.080]
There's my check from the sisters for three million.

[00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:51.620]
This is from David Katen.

[00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:53.240]
From David Katen.

[00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:53.880]
That's beautiful.

[00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:55.600]
Oh, I love it.

[00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:55.940]
Okay.

[00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:57.600]
It sounds like it's ticking too.

[00:33:57.740 --> 00:33:58.480]
Thanks a lot, David.

[00:33:58.640 --> 00:33:58.840]
Okay.

[00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:01.960]
And you know the Merck and Flickers Association.

[00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:03.880]
Okay, look at this stuff is coming in here.

[00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:07.080]
Boy, this makes me feel like I've almost accomplished something here for 20 years.

[00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:08.340]
Like learning how to be a freeloader.

[00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:09.480]
That's really what I've learned.

[00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:10.880]
That's what I should have said.

[00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:11.980]
And both of those articles,

[00:34:11.980 --> 00:34:14.600]
the only thing I've really learned in 20 years is how to be a good snorer.

[00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:15.800]
What is it, Six Stations?

[00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:17.280]
Well, I was trying to figure it out.

[00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:18.480]
Melissa was asking me and I said,

[00:34:18.540 --> 00:34:19.420]
How many stations have been on?

[00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:20.220]
How come I can't...

[00:34:20.220 --> 00:34:21.820]
Is that Mike really like working or what?

[00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:23.720]
I have it open, but it seems to be doing it.

[00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:25.940]
Because Jacob keeps moving it and he has to dump the pot.

[00:34:26.200 --> 00:34:28.100]
He's throwing this like a crazy quake in here.

[00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:29.760]
How many stations have I been on?

[00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:35.180]
K-A-T, N-W-U-S, I-N-Z, Zeta, and here.

[00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:36.760]
That's only five last time I checked it.

[00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:37.560]
I leave anybody out.

[00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:38.380]
And we think K-A-T.

[00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:39.060]
Did Double do it?

[00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:39.880]
Did you get one now, Dinsha?

[00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:41.140]
What do you mean by that?

[00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:42.320]
Did you...

[00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:42.940]
Where was it?

[00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:44.040]
Was it I-N-Z?

[00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:45.080]
You left and came back?

[00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:45.900]
Mm-hmm.

[00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:47.220]
No?

[00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:47.500]
No.

[00:34:47.620 --> 00:34:49.940]
Well, N-W-S, I left for a month and went to Nashville and came back.

[00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:51.120]
Oh, that's right.

[00:34:51.780 --> 00:34:51.780]

[00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:52.960]
The famous...

[00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:53.920]
The famous Nashville.

[00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:54.360]
Yeah.

[00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:55.400]
W-L-A-C.

[00:34:56.180 --> 00:34:57.040]
That was a lot of fun.

[00:34:57.200 --> 00:34:59.260]
They tend to be a little clannish up there in Tennessee.

[00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:01.700]
You're a K or however you want to spell it.

[00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:03.420]
Yeah, that was like a little bit of vacation.

[00:35:03.940 --> 00:35:05.520]
These people are definitely not going to wait.

[00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:07.140]
Here's Dr. Votz.

[00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:08.280]
Dr. Votz.

[00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:08.380]
All right.

[00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:13.380]
N-W-S, I just call to give you congratulations for your 20 years of loyal community service.

[00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:14.060]
Thanks, Doc.

[00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:16.380]
And I heard you did a great show last Sunday.

[00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:17.120]
I, too, by the way.

[00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:20.460]
I had a good time and I got a lot of callers.

[00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:20.900]
I called.

[00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:22.100]
I got news for it.

[00:35:22.180 --> 00:35:25.020]
If I could set up all my calls like you did, I have a full board every day, too.

[00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:27.440]
Well, I didn't tell them what to say when they called.

[00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:29.660]
And I just let a lot of people know that I was going to be on.

[00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:33.560]
You've always told me that only about 1% of listeners ever call in.

[00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:36.520]
So I figured if I let 150 people know I was going to be on,

[00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:38.300]
then 1.5 people would call in.

[00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:39.360]
Yeah, that doesn't matter.

[00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:39.780]
Uh-huh.

[00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:41.980]
Anyway, are you wearing that candy cane jacket today?

[00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:42.540]
No, I'm not.

[00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:43.480]
I burned that.

[00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:43.740]
Yeah.

[00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:46.060]
You sound like you're absolutely glowing.

[00:35:46.220 --> 00:35:47.080]
I buried it with you.

[00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:48.540]
Call a catch in time at the cat.

[00:35:50.260 --> 00:35:51.100]
Oh, that's a good one.

[00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:51.920]
I buried it right now.

[00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:53.240]
I had to answer the way over your head.

[00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:53.800]
Exactly.

[00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:58.040]
So I've called into compliment you on your communication skills, your cooperation,

[00:35:58.060 --> 00:36:00.860]
and I think you're a great example of how people can take care of themselves

[00:36:00.860 --> 00:36:03.680]
and get themselves healthier as they show we say matured.

[00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:06.740]
And you also call to thank me for reminding you of the Atkins diet

[00:36:06.740 --> 00:36:07.780]
and all the way you've lost probably.

[00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:07.980]
Uh-huh.

[00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:08.240]

[00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:10.420]
You've been as good for me.

[00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:12.780]
I hope I've been as good for you as you've been for me.

[00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:16.080]
Now, since you did that audition here on Sunday on that Neil Wont Like It Show,

[00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:17.240]
did Steve Nichol call you back?

[00:36:17.620 --> 00:36:18.360]
No, he never did.

[00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:20.140]
Let's just go get drunk.

[00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:22.220]
Well, listen, just sit there by the phone.

[00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:24.260]
Let your patient's cooler, he'll sit there by the phone.

[00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:24.440]

[00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:25.860]
That calls coming any second.

[00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:29.780]
The funny part is that he makes a show called Neil Wont Like It.

[00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:30.040]
Yeah.

[00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:31.740]
But if you'd heard it, you probably would have liked it.

[00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:33.360]
So he can't even make a show that Neil Wont Like.

[00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:34.080]
There you go.

[00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:34.900]
Oh, you want to bet?

[00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:37.480]
Tune in the rest of the weekend, Mark.

[00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:38.680]
We'll see you.

[00:36:38.780 --> 00:36:39.260]
Thank you.

[00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:40.000]
Bye-bye.

[00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:41.580]
I'm like that. The doctor's calling.

[00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:43.740]
Speaking of weekend shows at IOD.

[00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:44.620]
Was that what you're doing here?

[00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:45.820]
Believe me, we could use you now.

[00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:47.860]
No, no, trust me.

[00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:47.860]

[00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:48.620]
Trust me.

[00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:55.800]
I have heard rumors that one Irene Richard is going to be doing a weekend talk show.

[00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:57.980]
Boy, WIOD, is this true?

[00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:00.460]
Well, I didn't want to let it on the bag.

[00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:03.060]
The rumor has it that we have a travel show starting out of weekend.

[00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:04.940]
And the hostess is going to be...

[00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:06.620]
It really is Irene Richard.

[00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:07.500]
How do you like that?

[00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:08.280]
So it is true.

[00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:10.280]
Can you believe that I still have that card part?

[00:37:10.620 --> 00:37:11.820]
That card is...

[00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:12.960]
She on right after Meg Green?

[00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:14.740]
No, Meg's the history.

[00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:15.860]
She's too big for us now.

[00:37:15.940 --> 00:37:16.720]
She's on Channel 4.

[00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:18.820]
She's a big star in our 6th or whichever one it is.

[00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:19.660]
6th, right?

[00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:21.200]
She's all over the place.

[00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:23.180]
Getting that bogus information to her.

[00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:25.280]
How do you find programs in this market?

[00:37:25.540 --> 00:37:27.120]
This TV stations are all weird.

[00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:27.600]
You know?

[00:37:27.940 --> 00:37:28.860]
You don't move delightful.

[00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:29.820]
And then you keep track of it.

[00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:32.820]
That's the best way to do it.

[00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:35.340]
And by the way, speaking of the weather furry,

[00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:37.460]
I noticed it was your column today?

[00:37:37.940 --> 00:37:38.960]
I forget who wrote it.

[00:37:39.020 --> 00:37:40.080]
I tried to avoid looking at that.

[00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:44.000]
But anyway, I think Tom had the column about the ratings still suck it channel before.

[00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:46.880]
Did you know that there are 8th and 8th station fields?

[00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:49.420]
Yeah, you see they had that big interest there in the beginning.

[00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:52.400]
You know, when they first, the first day when Brian came on...

[00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:55.800]
Plus they had like, they've saturated us and every station in the market with spots

[00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:58.460]
to promote the fact that Brian Norcross, the weather furry,

[00:37:58.460 --> 00:37:59.520]
was going to be the news furry.

[00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:01.580]
And so the first day in the overnight,

[00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:04.560]
it looked like, oh my God, the channel for ratings are going through the roof.

[00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:06.800]
Do you know that they fired Barbara Sloan?

[00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:07.980]
Do you know Barbara?

[00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:08.460]
Yes.

[00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:10.220]
One of the nicest, one of the best.

[00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:11.660]
I mean, everybody there loved her.

[00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:12.860]
She was a real pro.

[00:38:12.940 --> 00:38:13.380]
Real pro.

[00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:14.120]
She was great.

[00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:16.400]
She was one of the sweetest people I've ever met in my life.

[00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:19.200]
And they can't harass because they wanted to bring in some young bin vet.

[00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:22.280]
And then they wanted to bring Brian over there for whatever.

[00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:24.700]
What are they thinking about this guy?

[00:38:24.940 --> 00:38:25.940]
Well, I think it's not a news guy.

[00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:26.720]
I think I've got a lot of...

[00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:30.580]
This is just my opinion, but I think you're going to see that as everyone's contract runs out,

[00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:32.580]
every one of the old people there will be let go.

[00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:33.060]
Really?

[00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:34.000]
That's my opinion.

[00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:35.380]
Not Dave Game.

[00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:37.520]
They did take him off here.

[00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:38.520]
Well, we cut the food business.

[00:38:38.860 --> 00:38:39.380]
A lot.

[00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:39.920]
I'll tell you that.

[00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:45.000]
And the old channel for colliders, WTVJ, is now channel six.

[00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:45.980]
It's the NBC station.

[00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:46.480]
The EO.

[00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:48.160]
And what a concept.

[00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:49.640]
And you wonder why I'm confused.

[00:38:49.980 --> 00:38:50.940]
And channel four is...

[00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:52.200]
Yeah, see.

[00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:55.660]
Like Nuck Tom said, you know, move to Lakeland and you'll find out a lot about what's there.

[00:38:55.660 --> 00:38:57.160]
It's not really that tough, you know.

[00:38:57.200 --> 00:38:57.540]
Okay.

[00:38:57.660 --> 00:39:01.680]
Because you look on the air and you see Tony Cigaretteau without the suspenders, you know, you're

[00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:02.480]
on the TV day.

[00:39:02.820 --> 00:39:02.820]

[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:06.300]
And you see Dave Game covering the screen, blanketing your screen, you know, where your

[00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:06.720]
amp is.

[00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:07.000]
Yeah.

[00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:08.120]
They took him off the ear.

[00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:09.560]
Yeah, just kind of...

[00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:09.860]
They did.

[00:39:10.060 --> 00:39:12.220]
Yeah, because they wanted to just see the new Ben Bet news anchor.

[00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:13.660]
He was kind of blocking the...

[00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:15.820]
He...

[00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:17.360]
That I must get a satellite dish.

[00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:17.800]
Yeah.

[00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:18.580]
And I did.

[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:19.520]
Yes, I did.

[00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:19.920]
A big dish.

[00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:20.560]
Yes.

[00:39:20.740 --> 00:39:20.980]
Great.

[00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:23.300]
I've had it for about almost two and a half years.

[00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:25.420]
You know that Tom had a dish before I did even.

[00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:25.720]
Yeah.

[00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:26.900]
I almost talked you into it.

[00:39:27.020 --> 00:39:27.120]
Right.

[00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:27.920]
Yeah.

[00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:30.100]
And I really enjoy it.

[00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:31.000]
It's very good.

[00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:32.100]
I just want to...

[00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:36.260]
In fact, Rich was the one that got me my first dish illegally, of course, with some Arab

[00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:37.440]
from Israel somewhere.

[00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:41.820]
And then, so that means Tom and you and I and Rich, that's four people in one room, Skyler

[00:39:41.820 --> 00:39:43.020]
of course, can't afford a dish.

[00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:44.080]
I haven't got cable yet.

[00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:44.360]

[00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:45.120]
If you could afford...

[00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:46.080]
You can't even afford a set.

[00:39:46.180 --> 00:39:47.480]
Much less for...

[00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:47.580]
Yeah.

[00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:48.700]
Now I know you're kidding.

[00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:49.760]
Yeah.

[00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:49.920]

[00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:50.540]
What did you do to you?

[00:39:51.300 --> 00:39:52.240]
Well, I'm sure the reason...

[00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:54.280]
Got any openings at ABC liquor's plenty, Chan?

[00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:56.680]
I'm sure the reason that Glenn got the dishes...

[00:39:56.680 --> 00:39:57.840]
You don't want to miss all that sports.

[00:39:58.920 --> 00:39:59.180]
Right.

[00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:01.080]
They do sports on the dish?

[00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:04.380]
In fact, probably the first time you got was GN, so you can see all the cup games.

[00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:05.740]
Because I know you were a big fan.

[00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:07.940]
Why would you want a dish if you don't want to watch sports?

[00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:09.860]
Oh, I didn't know they had...

[00:40:09.860 --> 00:40:11.060]
I didn't know they had it on there.

[00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:14.640]
You don't know Channel 6, I mean.

[00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:16.480]
He's watching the Sundance channel.

[00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:19.720]
But didn't I see this hockey game a few weeks ago?

[00:40:20.060 --> 00:40:23.620]
And the puck was like glowing blue, you know?

[00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:25.080]
And they hit it and it goes,

[00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:26.500]
and you could see it.

[00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:27.460]
How did it go?

[00:40:27.660 --> 00:40:27.920]
How did it go?

[00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:30.320]
That was exactly how it went.

[00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:30.640]
Yeah.

[00:40:30.980 --> 00:40:32.880]
There's something you might be thinking about doing.

[00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:35.260]
Do the audio, the sound effects for the Fox track.

[00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:36.260]
Yeah.

[00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:37.580]
That's exactly how it went.

[00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:40.660]
They just don't understand that they think that people don't watch the game.

[00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:42.720]
You know, this old thing about not following the puck.

[00:40:43.220 --> 00:40:44.360]
There aren't that many hockey fans.

[00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:45.580]
They have to develop hockey fans.

[00:40:45.580 --> 00:40:46.920]
They don't need blue lights around the game.

[00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:50.520]
Yeah, well, everything that Fox appeals to is like a prepubescent mentality.

[00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:51.380]
That's their whole idea.

[00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:53.660]
All of their program is presented at that level.

[00:40:54.020 --> 00:40:55.800]
So they figure, even if it's a hockey game,

[00:40:56.100 --> 00:40:57.500]
they have to appeal to little kids.

[00:40:57.620 --> 00:40:58.660]
And the little kids loved it.

[00:40:58.980 --> 00:41:01.340]
Anybody over the age of 10 hated it because, you know,

[00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:03.000]
it just interfered with your enjoyment of the game.

[00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:05.580]
And it's like, it was while I was watching a video game.

[00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:07.920]
I've never heard a hockey fan say they had a problem.

[00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:12.300]
No, the guy from John Shannon who produces hockey night in Canada said they've been doing their show for 50 years.

[00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:15.440]
They've never had one call from anybody saying, I can't see the puck.

[00:41:15.620 --> 00:41:17.560]
Why don't you do something that I can't follow the puck?

[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:19.480]
But hey, that's Fox for you.

[00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:21.580]
That's where we're more has some problems following the puck.

[00:41:21.580 --> 00:41:23.240]
Well, there you go, speaking of Fox.

[00:41:23.780 --> 00:41:25.920]
So anyway, it's 10.54. He'll be out next year.

[01:09:36.150 --> 01:09:43.610]
called from a plane on a way to la uh so which i expect from Gary Bruce the major asshole no not

[01:09:43.610 --> 01:09:48.850]

[01:10:08.050 --> 01:10:13.050]
worse than that yes i don't believe that how do you like all the nice things steveaux said about me

[01:10:13.050 --> 01:10:16.850]
in a paper the other day how do you like that except for a minor couple of minor character flaws

[01:10:16.850 --> 01:10:21.630]
i'm sorry i can't be perfect like you are Steve but i'm working on it okay i'm working to correct

[01:10:21.630 --> 01:10:26.610]
those minor flaws well listen i got one request today yeah would you play that little piece of him

[01:10:26.610 --> 01:10:32.510]
going with that that uh where he's stammering away you know because i love that i love that you

just tell me just tell me you don't mean uh mr. ego do you yeah now wouldn't i see isn't that

[01:10:37.950 --> 01:10:41.930]
interesting we're nearly called in and Henry and the whole gang from waxy how come we haven't had a

[01:10:41.930 --> 01:10:46.190]
call from anybody oh that's because it's probably paxon because i know that Steve would be just

[01:10:46.190 --> 01:10:52.650]
dying to call it over here just just just just just just just tell me what your problem is

[01:10:52.650 --> 01:10:57.970]

[01:11:05.090 --> 01:11:11.370]
hey it sounds it sounds evasive to me is what it is me evasive yeah and when you say what should

[01:11:11.370 --> 01:11:15.530]
you expect from boy gary does that mean you really haven't had the opportunity is is he there yet

[01:11:16.330 --> 01:11:21.250]
uh no as a matter of fact i heard a story that one reason that it was taken a while to get down is

[01:11:21.250 --> 01:11:26.150]
that there were no hotel rooms available in town to put him up in yeah and that was the language

[01:11:26.150 --> 01:11:31.330]
or maybe there were none that would accept him which sounds more likely to me well i don't want you to

[01:11:31.330 --> 01:11:34.910]
go away would you hang on for a minute yes because i want you to speak your old friend is going to

[01:11:34.910 --> 01:11:38.890]

[01:21:59.030 --> 01:22:02.990]
select group of them i'll tell you that small group but he said good things about you in the

[01:22:02.990 --> 01:22:07.510]
newspaper and i said good things about him that's true i do respect the fact that he's taken like a

[01:22:08.010 --> 01:22:11.810]

[01:24:32.750 --> 01:24:39.270]
we had a big one with the big dream remember with drapes on it and i was holding the drapes i was

[01:24:39.270 --> 01:24:43.870]
laughing so hard i had to hold myself up and falling on the floor and here's this poor man trying

[01:24:43.870 --> 01:24:48.390]
to finish the spot on here and just as right in the faces you are now that's how red you were the

[01:24:48.390 --> 01:24:52.390]
tears were rolling down your cheeks it was great you know for two hundred and fifteen bucks a week

[01:25:20.470 --> 01:25:24.770]
and the larry kings who proved just the opposite the very king that was a great call by the way though

[01:25:24.770 --> 01:25:30.030]
what do you make of it what what do you say i don't have a bonus but yeah well what do you say

[01:25:30.030 --> 01:25:35.950]
after hearing that call let's go is the guy an acid or an an you know something and he will when

during the news jc said that king wanted him on us a guest and be over here at quarter to twelve

[01:26:27.790 --> 01:26:34.070]
he was the midnight then and i had my guest over here at quarter to twelve yeah and uh he came out

[01:26:34.070 --> 01:26:39.130]
and said he knew nothing about it and didn't want me and he acted towards me like i was dung under

[01:26:39.130 --> 01:26:45.230]
his feet that was my one meeting with him uh huh yeah right yeah that's like larry i think larry

i think they crash you get an apology for that i will i give it to you okay same old hardass

[01:26:50.330 --> 01:26:55.030]
but he he calls on the phone this is now are you familiar with the call at fill Henry

did fill made larry look like an even bigger raston the bigger than ever he has in his life okay even

[01:27:00.730 --> 01:27:06.070]
then naturally with that phone call with doing Bob greens voice and crying on here this is like three

[01:27:06.070 --> 01:27:10.870]
four weeks ago and Phil's been playing the tape it's like legendary from coast to coast and on

[01:27:19.890 --> 01:27:25.030]
that thing we got it on tape all over the place where anybody could do a neo roger's kind of show

[01:27:25.030 --> 01:27:31.610]
and say dirty words that kind of broadcasting has appealed to a certain element that i do not

[01:27:31.610 --> 01:27:38.910]
desire to appeal to what word did you say asshole so so and now he calls and kisses my ass which

[01:27:38.910 --> 01:27:42.890]

[01:38:21.390 --> 01:38:26.070]
deck seeing those empty seats you know is there any way is there any way since you're such a

[01:38:26.070 --> 01:38:30.370]
knowledgeable hockey guy that you could slide down between periods the odd time just give me the odd

[01:38:43.910 --> 01:38:48.510]
these guys are the biggest bunch of second guess and fools I've ever seen in my life here's a

[01:38:48.510 --> 01:38:53.130]
guy's been in a league like he says six months he's got a team that's got 78 points that's right on

[01:38:53.130 --> 01:38:57.450]
the ass of the ranger still ahead of those overpaid flyers and all about tied with the Pittsburgh

[01:38:57.450 --> 01:39:02.090]
bank tied with those Pittsburgh pen with the blue and yaga and Francis and all of those goyem over

[01:39:02.090 --> 01:39:06.910]
there and all they want to know is how come he started this one and these people as you're finding

[01:39:06.910 --> 01:39:11.350]
out real fast dog they're not easy to please it only took me 20 years to find that out but I'll

[01:39:11.470 --> 01:39:15.470]
say it's really fine I really enjoy it down here and it's a pleasure but I'll say I'm lucky to have

[01:39:15.470 --> 01:39:20.210]
you as a big booster because oh boy this I thought the suction was bad from Larry King before

[01:39:20.210 --> 01:39:24.890]
done didn't we win last night I beg your pardon hey listen I said to Rimmer I'd fall in

[01:39:24.890 --> 01:39:30.050]
lungs we didn't lose yeah but anyway I'm really happy for you you know Rimmer said you know it

[01:39:30.050 --> 01:39:34.350]
tires like Kissing Denise Poppan that's what he said and I can't think of too many things more

[01:39:34.350 --> 01:39:38.710]
disgusting than that so how's the anniversary party going it's great it's dynamite Larry King

[01:39:38.710 --> 01:39:42.410]
called in before and we're trying to separate his tongue from i buttocks as we speak now it's

[01:39:42.410 --> 01:39:46.490]
it's unbelievable we got food here like you've never seen don cherry called in this morning you missed

[01:39:46.490 --> 01:39:51.210]
that I'll bet your kitten well I have to go on the ice but listen to everybody to boss and

[01:39:51.210 --> 01:39:55.310]
chicken the famous when I was down there no we got better than that not that we don't like

[01:39:55.310 --> 01:39:59.590]

[01:39:59.590 --> 01:40:04.250]

[01:40:08.270 --> 01:40:13.270]
you know what I'm saying Dougie you know and I out there doing a great job but it was a thrill of

[01:40:13.270 --> 01:40:16.910]
a lifetime to be on with you nailed there's no doubt about that I won't get the plotter that's what

[01:40:16.910 --> 01:40:21.750]
Rimmer always says the thrill of a lifetime remember to get lost and I said look at me viewing your

[01:40:21.750 --> 01:40:27.470]
mediocre career I would believe it he's the biggest pain that he is I can't listen I can't even go

[01:40:27.470 --> 01:40:32.530]
home and wipe my behind that phone is I walk in the door and the phone is ringing like frantically I

[01:40:32.530 --> 01:40:37.390]

[01:43:28.610 --> 01:43:30.290]
Or everybody in the building is moist

[01:43:31.490 --> 01:43:33.010]

That was great guys

[01:43:42.030 --> 01:43:46.310]
Oh no you know something as incredible as the Larry King call was

[01:43:46.310 --> 01:43:48.410]
This one could be a close second hello

[01:43:49.070 --> 01:43:52.910]
Oh I look I figured if Larry King could get away with calling so could I

[01:43:54.570 --> 01:43:55.610]
Steve Patterson

[01:43:55.610 --> 01:43:56.510]
Oh God

[01:43:59.490 --> 01:44:02.530]
You can blame Boca Brian for this call

[01:44:02.530 --> 01:44:03.770]
You son of a bitch

[01:44:03.770 --> 01:44:05.550]

Thanks a lot I had a call and wish you a happy anniversary

[01:44:08.370 --> 01:44:09.490]
Thank you very much for the opportunity

[01:44:09.490 --> 01:44:11.890]
And thanks for leaving us all of those stiff cards

[01:44:11.890 --> 01:44:13.870]
I mean all those cards that we could bulk erase

[01:44:13.870 --> 01:44:16.950]
Anybody ever bothered to tell me I didn't work there anymore

[01:44:16.950 --> 01:44:19.010]
I would have been happy to erase them and put them away

[01:44:19.010 --> 01:44:20.650]
We're too busy drinking over here

[01:44:20.650 --> 01:44:22.450]
We don't have time to communicate with the talent

[01:44:22.450 --> 01:44:23.870]
So it's been a pleasure

[01:44:23.870 --> 01:44:25.450]
What is it?

[01:44:25.710 --> 01:44:26.170]
Of course

[01:44:26.170 --> 01:44:30.430]
Of course God forbid I just come down to the schedule with my name not on it

[01:44:30.430 --> 01:44:31.090]
And that's the message

[01:44:31.090 --> 01:44:32.490]
Ron is weekend by the way

[01:44:32.490 --> 01:44:32.930]
Pardon?

[01:44:33.350 --> 01:44:35.950]

Me too

[01:44:37.970 --> 01:44:39.090]
Thanks a lot Steve

[01:44:39.090 --> 01:44:43.010]
Happy happy and I hope you don't have to go through another 20 years

[01:44:43.010 --> 01:44:43.810]
I pray

[01:44:43.810 --> 01:44:44.550]
Okay

[01:44:44.550 --> 01:44:45.010]
I pray every minute

[01:44:45.010 --> 01:44:46.470]
Okay, well congratulations

[01:44:46.470 --> 01:44:47.290]
Okay, bye

[01:44:47.290 --> 01:44:48.410]
See ya, get him out of here

[01:44:48.950 --> 01:44:50.830]
Okay so anyway that's Steve Patterson

[01:44:50.830 --> 01:44:53.490]
Now you were out of here before we had Steve Patterson

[01:44:54.110 --> 01:44:55.130]
I don't know him

[01:44:55.810 --> 01:44:57.090]
I assume production

[01:44:57.590 --> 01:44:59.250]
No no he was a weekend guy

[01:44:59.250 --> 01:45:00.630]
Oh there you go

[01:45:00.630 --> 01:45:03.570]
He was like in the same old Hen like his Chris Baker, Joey Reynolds

[01:45:03.570 --> 01:45:06.730]
Along a run of great winners that we've had on a weekend sir

[01:45:06.730 --> 01:45:07.050]
Yeah

[01:45:07.050 --> 01:45:10.490]
In fact my bottles are twitching now just to recounting all these great names

[01:45:11.190 --> 01:45:16.630]
Yeah you know it's interesting there's a couple of talk radio stations I hear up there

[01:45:16.630 --> 01:45:18.410]
They play music on the weekends

[01:45:18.410 --> 01:45:19.150]
Yeah

[01:45:19.150 --> 01:45:20.290]
You know they play

[01:45:20.290 --> 01:45:22.310]
Oh God is that a good idea for us

[01:45:22.310 --> 01:45:23.370]
Think about it

[01:45:23.370 --> 01:45:26.290]
They play like jazz or they play nice music

[01:45:26.290 --> 01:45:31.110]
You think about it you don't have to go through any of that trying to find

[01:45:31.110 --> 01:45:34.070]
But wouldn't that be a good compliment for us all jazz all weekend

[01:45:34.070 --> 01:45:34.910]
See ya buddy

[01:45:34.910 --> 01:45:35.390]
Yeah

[01:45:36.250 --> 01:45:36.730]
Exactly

[01:45:36.730 --> 01:45:37.390]
Right

[01:45:37.390 --> 01:45:38.550]
Yeah buddy

[01:45:38.550 --> 01:45:42.250]
Well such an interesting idea and it works

[01:45:42.250 --> 01:45:44.370]
You know I swear I hear him do it

[01:45:44.910 --> 01:45:49.110]
I just never thought about it when we were here dealing with all that

[01:45:49.110 --> 01:45:49.870]
And I say this

[01:45:49.870 --> 01:45:53.550]
Is Irene Richard still here who's getting ready to do a weekend show tomorrow?

[01:45:53.930 --> 01:45:56.790]
I wasn't thinking of Irene

[01:45:56.790 --> 01:45:58.130]
Is he going to consult him now or what?

[01:45:58.130 --> 01:45:59.610]
Yeah he's consulting

[01:45:59.610 --> 01:46:02.190]
And quite frankly at this point it could only be an improvement

[01:46:02.190 --> 01:46:05.070]
Okay so anyway it's 1225 and WIOD

[01:46:05.070 --> 01:46:09.990]
We ought to take some calls from some real people here in the next hour so because these people are going to get upset and cranky

[01:46:09.990 --> 01:46:10.950]
Oh but I've liked these

[01:46:11.390 --> 01:46:13.510]
The celebrities have been fast calling yes

[01:46:13.510 --> 01:46:14.370]
Flammely not one

[01:46:14.370 --> 01:46:14.930]
That one

[01:46:14.930 --> 01:46:16.390]
Yeah you'll never forget it

[01:46:16.390 --> 01:46:20.750]
I only wish we would have had a better follow that end to the obvious quality of the whole night

[01:46:20.750 --> 01:46:22.310]
It was perfect no the connection with their first

[01:46:22.310 --> 01:46:27.410]
Just something you just you seriously I mean a lot of the stuff is is stick but in his case

[01:46:27.410 --> 01:46:32.710]
No you go home and you look in the mirror and you ask yourself is there no shame anywhere in this world?

[01:46:33.230 --> 01:46:37.530]
Is there no ass anywhere that this man won't lick it's just it's just amazing

[01:46:37.530 --> 01:46:42.430]
It's astonishing and I think that once upon a time not in this room because this studio was near but somewhere in the

[01:46:42.430 --> 01:46:45.170]
Bibles of this building that man infested this place

[01:46:45.570 --> 01:46:50.990]
And you know that Rimmer who also is another guy that Larry says just said by the phone you got a call coming you're going to be working at DC

[01:46:50.990 --> 01:46:53.770]
You're going to have the biggest job in town a hundred thousand a month

[01:46:54.390 --> 01:46:58.850]
Another one of those guys that's heard Larry's the tales of wall which never come true he's going to pick him up at the

[01:46:58.850 --> 01:47:08.450]
Airport and bring him and he will be sitting in the studio yes and guess what is there anybody out there who where does the line form for people who would like to bring the food for Larry on that day

[01:47:09.030 --> 01:47:14.170]
Remember remember Godfather 3 I wouldn't be surprised if we have a bunch of canolies here on that day huh

Now you told them Villa deli is what you told them yeah yeah you think that'll happen could be

[01:47:20.470 --> 01:47:24.930]
But I wouldn't be surprised since that is over there on the beach I wouldn't be surprised if there's a few people over there on the beach

[01:47:24.930 --> 01:47:28.390]
What's that guy that used to call all the time I'm QAM what's the guy's name

[01:47:29.190 --> 01:47:34.210]
Every time that's all he would talk about is how Larry King over the money used to call Bill Carter he put Bill in his grave

[01:47:34.210 --> 01:47:40.270]
We won't call too many you know what I'm talking about if they if the this guy that's all he talks about he lives for the day

[01:47:40.270 --> 01:47:49.810]

Congratulations Neil and twilight I at 12 30 last night on 125 stations. I did the same thing

[01:51:16.630 --> 01:51:23.650]
So I'm gonna believe this somebody sends me a portable toilet. It says here's to 20 years down the toilet

[01:51:23.650 --> 01:51:25.810]
Oh the speakers in the back

[01:51:30.510 --> 01:51:36.710]
And it's a place called 225 unlimited toilet bank. It's a place that sells like little make-believe toilets

[01:51:37.230 --> 01:51:41.250]
Let's just reminisce with about W. Steeves for just a second. Yeah, wait

[01:51:41.250 --> 01:51:45.610]
Well, which time the first time you were there the second time the first time okay

[01:51:45.610 --> 01:51:48.750]
With the bullet holes in the right right

[01:51:49.190 --> 01:51:54.870]
The bullet holes in the front of the building and me doing a program with an umbrella

[01:51:54.870 --> 01:52:00.450]
You remember that well? I don't know well no way man. There was I'll tell you a better one than that

[01:52:00.450 --> 01:52:02.590]
There was a day when we had a torrential rain

[01:52:03.090 --> 01:52:09.250]
And on the front door do you remember this yeah the front door the station was like warped and there was a big opening between

[01:52:09.250 --> 01:52:14.890]
Remember the at the bottom of the front door in the sidewalk and like gallons and gallons of water came pouring in our flagless

[01:52:14.890 --> 01:52:20.090]
Street into the building and I can remember the phone guys crawling around on their hands and knees

[01:52:20.090 --> 01:52:25.270]
Putting that what is that stuff they put on a context that kind of like a dust or somewhere

[01:52:25.270 --> 01:52:29.470]
Where the hell it is to try to drive the phone context and they got done like about two minutes to eight

[01:52:29.470 --> 01:52:30.970]
I'm sitting there in bare feet

[01:52:31.550 --> 01:52:36.230]
Doing a talk show waiting to get electrocuted at eight o'clock on a Monday night. I remember

[01:52:37.390 --> 01:52:42.910]
Yeah, that the only good thing about that location is you can walk across the street and get some of the best the guys in the world

[01:52:42.910 --> 01:52:46.450]
Yeah, that way that made it worthwhile. Yeah, that's it

[01:52:46.450 --> 01:52:49.290]
Well listen, it's great to talk to you and

[01:52:49.290 --> 01:52:55.770]
Congratulations. I've been reading all the newspapers stuff about you and I'm glad they rediscovered that you're still in the market

[01:52:55.770 --> 01:53:00.470]
Yeah, like once every 20 years they figured it's you know worth while they bite their tongue and they write something

[01:53:00.470 --> 01:53:05.570]
I said, Bob, you know how that goes. Yeah, who else is there because I I haven't been listening the last 10 minutes

[01:53:06.150 --> 01:53:09.290]
So my women you didn't hear the Larry King call no

[01:53:09.830 --> 01:53:18.650]
Yeah, everybody so help me as as my hand to the sky if you ever hear the Larry King call that I got you will wet your pants at least 40 times today

[01:53:18.650 --> 01:53:23.650]
Was your wake? He was he was like semi-encoherty called on him. He was on a plane to LA

[01:53:23.650 --> 01:53:28.430]
The first connection we had was so I said it sounds like Larry King and a Ron Popeel

[01:53:28.430 --> 01:53:34.410]
Vigimatic Blender that's what it sounded like and then he actually called back again on a better connection to kiss my ass

[01:53:34.410 --> 01:53:39.370]
I have never I have never seen a man who's made more billions by licking ass than this man

[01:53:39.370 --> 01:53:41.010]
And he even licked mine in fact

[01:53:41.010 --> 01:53:46.790]
I'm gonna get myself a goddamn tattoo that says Larry King lick this. I'm gonna get a tattoo right on my hands

[01:53:46.790 --> 01:53:51.770]
I got a bumper sticker says how many jobs has Larry King got for you? Yeah, exactly

[01:53:51.770 --> 01:53:58.130]
Yeah, yeah, firmware is gonna put one of those on his guard too. So in other words, it was a normal Larry King call. Yeah

[01:53:58.130 --> 01:53:59.590]
It was just

[01:53:59.590 --> 01:54:02.130]
I have a collect cost in Larry King

[01:54:02.830 --> 01:54:04.210]
Yeah, there you go

[01:54:05.270 --> 01:54:07.210]
Typical Larry King call you got it

[01:54:07.990 --> 01:54:12.370]
That's that's something. Well hang in there Stan. Hey listen. I called on the 524 number

[01:54:12.370 --> 01:54:18.010]
You think I'll ever get back in your good crisis so I can have a VIP line so I don't have to read dial 100 times

[01:54:18.010 --> 01:54:19.110]
Yeah, might cost you

[01:54:19.910 --> 01:54:19.930]
Haha

[01:54:20.630 --> 01:54:23.150]
I good luck. See you everybody. Bye

[01:54:23.650 --> 01:54:29.110]
You know how quick he got off as soon as I said cost him. Hey listen. It was well worth it John Lynch and ESEA

[01:54:29.730 --> 01:54:36.170]
Hey Neil in Chicago. I'm sorry. This is Alex Bennett. Yeah sounds like it sounds like a real boring guy

[01:54:36.170 --> 01:54:40.110]
Happy anniversary. You're a good guy job. But you always were boring except when you got drunk at a party

[01:54:42.370 --> 01:54:47.590]
That's Disney but Disney quit drinking, you know, did he really? He quit since January all the red is gone out of his face

[01:54:47.590 --> 01:54:50.730]
I think that was only since he got Howard off the year. Oh, yeah

[01:54:50.730 --> 01:54:53.390]
I think that's when the red came back in with space when it knocked Howard off

[01:54:53.390 --> 01:54:57.210]
So ESEA how you doing? I'm good. I'm doing great

[01:54:57.210 --> 01:55:02.790]
I don't know. Luis Miguel Luis is he's ready to rock and roll. He's ready for you. Yeah

[01:55:04.430 --> 01:55:06.090]
I sure like to see that

[01:55:07.310 --> 01:55:13.070]
So how is this thing doing up there? Is he bringing that place to a great heights like he did here? Well

[01:55:19.070 --> 01:55:21.350]
That's the new the new format on CKG

[01:55:21.350 --> 01:55:25.990]
We're in the toilet again. Every four two. Yeah. No, no, everything's going fine here

[01:55:25.990 --> 01:55:28.910]
Um, we do miss you though quite a bit. Yeah, but

[01:55:29.690 --> 01:55:33.470]
Nothing quite like you on the air up here. Uh-huh. That's for damn sure

[01:55:33.470 --> 01:55:38.390]
I mean, there's nobody going around talking about everything else that goes on so uh

[01:55:38.390 --> 01:55:44.370]
You know, we really can't live like Harris. We've got to live like Harris. We truly should. Yeah, sure. Just like here. Mm-hmm

[01:55:44.370 --> 01:55:46.810]
Well listen, that's a real exciting John

[01:55:50.290 --> 01:55:53.390]
And it's great hearing from you especially ESEA. Don't take it personal. John you're okay

[01:55:53.390 --> 01:55:57.110]
But ESEA sees uh goddess. What can I tell you? Oh, thanks Neil. I love you

[01:55:57.110 --> 01:55:59.650]
What do you miss you? It's only because she used to bring you checks

[01:55:59.650 --> 01:56:03.810]
No, that's only because she went to the Luis Miguel concert with me and she was drooling just as much as I was

[01:56:03.810 --> 01:56:08.130]
Well, listen this October will fly you down special for another up close look. Okay sweetheart

[01:56:08.910 --> 01:56:10.290]
Okay, take care of yourselves

[01:56:10.290 --> 01:56:19.630]

[01:56:19.630 --> 01:56:22.010]
That's not how you spell ESEA. Okay, it is

[01:56:23.510 --> 01:56:26.130]
Listen Holyo. That's not how you spell ESEA

[01:56:27.110 --> 01:56:27.470]

[01:56:28.710 --> 01:56:29.070]
Yeah

[01:56:31.210 --> 01:56:33.070]
Spells ESEA does what it no

[01:56:33.770 --> 01:56:37.390]
I don't think so. I don't know what else that would say. Oh look at this here's the bookie

[01:56:38.830 --> 01:56:42.910]
Did you hear that call yesterday? Oh good. You wouldn't have showed up today if you would have

[01:56:43.310 --> 01:56:48.270]
So anyway, if your favorite bookie joint is burned down no problem at all because the pizza loft will be back in operation soon

[01:56:48.270 --> 01:56:52.370]
Yeah, a guy kid called up some holy only said that his best friend used to place all his bets

[01:56:52.370 --> 01:56:55.230]
Did you hear it? Right at the pizza lot. There's a guy up there

[01:56:55.230 --> 01:57:00.310]
What do you say the guy's name was Mike or some one of your stiffs and he said that they were working out running a bookie joint up there

[01:57:02.310 --> 01:57:04.730]
Yeah, I see you got that expensive house Jeff

Donnie Osmond show. Yeah, I do remember that always remember that for some

[01:57:17.330 --> 01:57:21.570]
There you can remember how Donnie Osmond had his shirt buttoned up

[01:57:21.570 --> 01:57:26.110]
He was sitting right where a broker Brian is right now and he had a shirt buttoned up to his the bottom of his chin

[01:57:26.110 --> 01:57:29.910]
Not that he was nervous being in here with his wife buttoned up the extra button remember

[01:57:30.310 --> 01:57:33.850]
She was really nervous. He was a great guy, but she was very uptight

[01:57:33.850 --> 01:57:40.330]
Right very room. Yeah, it's gory psychotic down touch him. Don't touch him. Sorry honey. He's a hairy and old now. It's all yours

[01:59:03.370 --> 01:59:08.070]
We'll keep you posted. The best news is news talking entertainment radio

[01:59:08.070 --> 01:59:14.710]
610 W I O D

[01:59:16.130 --> 01:59:16.850]
Oh

[01:59:27.050 --> 01:59:28.790]
20 years in my

[01:59:28.790 --> 01:59:31.270]
And the home of the strange

[01:59:34.610 --> 01:59:39.410]
Would have thought it would happen will not make me change

[01:59:41.230 --> 01:59:42.790]
The more I

[01:59:42.790 --> 01:59:43.190]
The

[01:59:43.190 --> 01:59:44.350]
And the

[01:59:44.350 --> 01:59:44.950]
The

[01:59:49.930 --> 01:59:51.770]
20 years in my

[01:59:51.770 --> 01:59:52.490]
And the

[01:59:52.490 --> 01:59:53.670]
And the

[02:00:08.510 --> 02:00:09.390]
And the

[02:00:09.390 --> 02:00:09.390]

[02:00:09.390 --> 02:00:09.390]

[02:00:09.390 --> 02:00:09.390]

[02:00:09.390 --> 02:00:09.390]

[02:00:09.390 --> 02:00:09.390]

[02:00:09.390 --> 02:00:09.390]

[02:00:09.390 --> 02:00:09.610]
Wow

[02:00:37.350 --> 02:00:37.590]
batteries

[02:00:37.590 --> 02:00:37.610]
Can

[02:00:37.610 --> 02:00:38.070]
Detail

[02:00:38.070 --> 02:00:38.090]
it

[02:00:38.090 --> 02:00:38.110]
The

[02:00:43.390 --> 02:00:47.950]
People are coldly rimmed though here, but when they're in hot,

[02:00:51.030 --> 02:00:56.110]
Summer and Tony is lyraking, spaded false hearts.

[02:00:58.130 --> 02:01:02.270]
The false turning blue and the delts to see it red,

[02:01:02.270 --> 02:01:06.310]
Palm beaches yell, the dream light is dead.

[02:01:06.790 --> 02:01:11.050]
All people come here to die, but the young ones get shot.

[02:01:14.450 --> 02:01:19.650]
Where the easy my enemy don't escape life.

[02:01:21.810 --> 02:01:27.350]
The whole world comes and it's focused, and it's on your guide.

[02:01:29.150 --> 02:01:33.230]
Share it with women, make sure they're in wings.

[02:01:33.510 --> 02:01:36.810]
And riots, bad diets, and war and hate.

[02:01:37.370 --> 02:01:42.150]
Can I also want a toothpick, nor could I say goodbye?

[02:01:45.350 --> 02:01:49.510]
Sometimes I feel that life is passing by.

[02:01:54.250 --> 02:01:57.970]
Okay, 1246 at WID, so anyway, this is just out of control today.

[02:01:58.090 --> 02:01:59.090]
It's been a dynamite.

[02:02:00.090 --> 02:02:02.990]
Here's a fact from Jerry Sullivan.

[02:02:03.650 --> 02:02:04.530]
Jerry Sullivan?

[02:02:06.350 --> 02:02:09.970]
He's now the general manager of WBDN in Clearwater.

[02:02:11.970 --> 02:02:12.450]
BDN.

[02:02:12.650 --> 02:02:14.910]
So from Miami, and then of course when they demoted him here,

[02:02:14.990 --> 02:02:16.750]
he was driving the overnight news truck.

[02:02:16.750 --> 02:02:17.470]
Remember that?

[02:02:17.670 --> 02:02:18.590]
That's a true story.

[02:02:18.950 --> 02:02:22.070]
That's the kind of company Cox broadcasting is Jerry Sullivan.

[02:02:22.070 --> 02:02:23.690]
One day he was the general manager.

[02:02:23.890 --> 02:02:28.270]
The next week he was driving the overnight news truck out on the streets.

[02:02:28.310 --> 02:02:29.610]
I think it was the program.

[02:02:29.750 --> 02:02:30.610]
The PD, yeah.

[02:02:31.370 --> 02:02:31.950]
That's right.

[02:02:32.070 --> 02:02:33.090]
Is that incredible?

[02:02:33.510 --> 02:02:33.970]
Remember that.

[02:02:34.350 --> 02:02:38.850]
In fact, from program directly, the only thing more exciting that will be when I come in next on Monday,

[02:02:38.850 --> 02:02:42.510]
and Steve Nichol is taking to Roberto's job, that'll be dynamite.

[02:02:42.610 --> 02:02:44.850]
You know when he starts cleaning the toilets and doing stuff like that?

[02:02:44.850 --> 02:02:48.350]
Which would be good because usually as his head down near one anyway, most of the time.

[02:02:48.710 --> 02:02:49.590]
So that's great.

[02:02:49.730 --> 02:02:52.070]
Well, I sure don't know what WBDN is in Clearwater.

[02:02:52.150 --> 02:02:52.530]
Clearwater.

[02:02:52.690 --> 02:02:54.570]
Probably a big e250 walk.

[02:02:54.590 --> 02:02:54.790]
Yeah.

[02:02:54.790 --> 02:02:55.410]
After research.

[02:02:55.870 --> 02:03:00.870]
Here's a gameless conduct, Alan Eagleton and the Corruption of Hockey by Russ Conway, a book

[02:03:00.870 --> 02:03:05.830]
from my good close personal friend, Jeff DeForest, who buys me a hockey book, which is incredible

[02:03:05.830 --> 02:03:07.510]
because he don't know nothing about it, but thanks, Steve.

[02:03:07.650 --> 02:03:08.310]
Well, I love a guy.

[02:03:08.430 --> 02:03:09.230]
Okay, you're really something.

[02:03:10.090 --> 02:03:12.990]
Now, speaking of Siddler Van, I don't know what to tell you.

[02:03:12.990 --> 02:03:15.170]
Now, wouldn't you think if he was a man she would be here today?

[02:03:15.190 --> 02:03:17.930]
The first guy I worked for in Miami 20 years ago.

[02:03:18.370 --> 02:03:20.050]
I don't know what he really was.

[02:03:20.050 --> 02:03:21.170]
He really was the...

[02:03:21.170 --> 02:03:22.510]
Yeah, but that was in the old days.

[02:03:22.570 --> 02:03:24.370]
He once I changed the style of the show.

[02:03:24.570 --> 02:03:24.970]
Oh, yeah.

[02:03:25.490 --> 02:03:28.450]
Oh, then all of a sudden I was like a piece of crap.

[02:03:28.670 --> 02:03:32.810]
Just like that goddamn Disney man, when he went up to Chicago, you know, he was singing a different tune.

[02:03:33.330 --> 02:03:35.110]
What do you think you'd call him would think of you today?

[02:03:35.650 --> 02:03:35.850]
Who?

[02:03:36.090 --> 02:03:37.930]
You call like he's rolling over in a grave.

[02:03:38.110 --> 02:03:38.550]
You know what I'm saying?

[02:03:38.630 --> 02:03:40.310]
She's saying it's the most disgusting show.

[02:03:40.490 --> 02:03:41.190]
That's my opinion.

[02:03:41.470 --> 02:03:42.110]
I'm like Disney.

[02:03:42.110 --> 02:03:43.150]
Happy 20th year.

[02:03:43.450 --> 02:03:44.010]
Thanks, Mike.

[02:03:44.770 --> 02:03:45.490]
How's Howard doing?

[02:03:45.530 --> 02:03:46.570]
I mean, how's things going?

[02:03:46.970 --> 02:03:47.950]
Oh, that was good.

[02:03:48.250 --> 02:03:48.370]
Good, good.

[02:03:48.510 --> 02:03:50.270]
I'm actually in Los Angeles right now.

[02:03:50.390 --> 02:03:50.970]
Are you really?

[02:03:51.270 --> 02:03:51.490]
Yeah.

[02:03:51.690 --> 02:03:53.730]
We just had a call from John Lynch and ESEA.

[02:03:54.170 --> 02:03:55.050]
Oh, my God.

[02:03:55.190 --> 02:03:56.110]
They weren't there with you, were they?

[02:03:56.370 --> 02:03:57.070]
No, no, no.

[02:03:57.110 --> 02:03:57.850]
I think they...

[02:03:57.850 --> 02:03:58.910]
Are they still working for us in Chicago?

[02:03:59.270 --> 02:04:00.890]
No, they said no, as a matter of fact.

[02:04:01.030 --> 02:04:04.850]
They said there's been a massive rebellion since you went to LA and when you come back, you got a couple of supplies.

[02:04:05.010 --> 02:04:05.890]
I don't know what they meant by that.

[02:04:06.090 --> 02:04:06.770]
I'll be back tomorrow.

[02:04:06.990 --> 02:04:07.650]
Yeah, there you go.

[02:04:09.010 --> 02:04:10.110]
So what's going on, Disney?

[02:04:10.110 --> 02:04:11.430]
Oh, I don't know.

[02:04:11.610 --> 02:04:11.950]
I just...

[02:04:11.950 --> 02:04:14.070]
I went inside Joe and I was born last night.

[02:04:14.070 --> 02:04:15.750]
We're seeing the gin blossoms tonight.

[02:04:15.990 --> 02:04:16.170]
Yeah.

[02:04:16.490 --> 02:04:18.230]
Just kind of hanging out doing that LA thing.

[02:04:18.490 --> 02:04:22.850]
In fact, John Lynch said that you've given up drinking, that you're knows that your whole head is all over the...

[02:04:22.850 --> 02:04:25.270]
That blood is drained back into your system now and that you're...

[02:04:25.270 --> 02:04:27.050]
You know, you've lost that beet red complexion.

[02:04:27.110 --> 02:04:28.610]
Yeah, I don't have my eternal suntan.

[02:04:28.750 --> 02:04:29.530]
Oh, thank God.

[02:04:30.350 --> 02:04:32.990]
That's probably from being in Chicago, not from Mother Drinking Part.

[02:04:33.090 --> 02:04:33.550]
Right, right.

[02:04:33.730 --> 02:04:34.610]
Trying to clean up my life.

[02:04:34.770 --> 02:04:34.950]
Yeah.

[02:04:35.290 --> 02:04:36.070]
You're my inspiration.

[02:04:36.330 --> 02:04:36.570]
Sure.

[02:04:36.890 --> 02:04:37.430]
Yeah, just...

[02:04:37.430 --> 02:04:37.870]
Yeah, exactly.

[02:04:38.170 --> 02:04:39.130]
Well, I was thinking about you.

[02:04:39.230 --> 02:04:39.990]
You know how that is, Mike.

[02:04:40.050 --> 02:04:40.830]
I just got overwhelmed.

[02:04:41.070 --> 02:04:41.390]
Absolutely.

[02:04:41.650 --> 02:04:45.950]
I think back to those great little meetings, we used to have at Denny's when we were putting our deal together.

[02:04:46.010 --> 02:04:47.410]
Yeah, those planned destined meetings.

[02:04:47.530 --> 02:04:50.610]
That's another thing about the class of this corporation, they got $8 billion.

[02:04:51.230 --> 02:04:55.450]
Where do they take you to meet you when they want to hire you to impress you with what a bunch of big spenders they are?

[02:04:55.750 --> 02:04:57.050]
They meet you at Denny's.

[02:04:57.310 --> 02:04:59.270]
You know, even a guy from GBS.

[02:04:59.450 --> 02:05:00.210]
What the hell was his name?

[02:05:00.790 --> 02:05:01.110]
GBS.

[02:05:01.430 --> 02:05:02.170]
Danny De La Retta.

[02:05:02.470 --> 02:05:03.670]
Even Danny De La Retta.

[02:05:03.710 --> 02:05:06.330]
In fact, he took me to Denny's, so I'd say it's an equal match, okay?

[02:05:07.270 --> 02:05:07.590]
Unbelievable.

[02:05:07.710 --> 02:05:08.930]
I used to go to those meetings.

[02:05:09.390 --> 02:05:09.390]

[02:05:09.390 --> 02:05:10.330]
A Denny's in 125th.

[02:05:11.030 --> 02:05:11.730]
In fact, I think that's right.

[02:05:12.050 --> 02:05:14.350]
Isn't that where we cemented the deal, my good friend Saul Fouce.

[02:05:14.410 --> 02:05:16.750]
By the way, a Saul, like in a prison near you, or where is he these days?

[02:05:16.770 --> 02:05:17.470]
I think he's near you.

[02:05:17.590 --> 02:05:20.410]
I heard he was in some country club prison in Orlando or something.

[02:05:20.490 --> 02:05:20.830]
Is he?

[02:05:20.990 --> 02:05:21.190]
Yeah.

[02:05:21.290 --> 02:05:23.090]
Because God, I could sure use a good agent, man.

[02:05:24.910 --> 02:05:25.950]
You don't need an agent.

[02:05:26.050 --> 02:05:27.130]
He never got any of my, okay?

[02:05:27.210 --> 02:05:29.370]
Yeah, that's what all you general managers always tell us.

[02:05:29.410 --> 02:05:29.870]
That's a good agent.

[02:05:30.590 --> 02:05:31.830]
We'll take good care of you.

[02:05:32.810 --> 02:05:34.750]
Well, I just want to call it a happy 20th.

[02:05:34.830 --> 02:05:35.530]
Oh, thanks, Diz.

[02:05:35.710 --> 02:05:36.010]
You bet.

[02:05:36.010 --> 02:05:36.850]
And we miss you.

[02:05:36.970 --> 02:05:37.710]
That's the way we are.

[02:05:37.730 --> 02:05:41.450]
And boy, Gary, you know, boy, Gary's starting Monday in the voice palm of JNO.

[02:05:41.750 --> 02:05:42.290]
No, he's not.

[02:05:42.610 --> 02:05:43.170]
Yes, he is.

[02:05:43.170 --> 02:05:43.610]
Are you serious?

[02:05:43.810 --> 02:05:46.010]
I swear to God, swearing you cola cats in time.

[02:05:46.010 --> 02:05:48.050]
He's going to be the PD and cold morning host.

[02:05:48.590 --> 02:05:50.510]
And we, the tears are in our eyes.

[02:05:50.610 --> 02:05:51.830]
And he wants to sample cats, your show.

[02:05:52.070 --> 02:05:52.430]
Exactly.

[02:05:53.270 --> 02:05:54.090]
Have it right here.

[02:05:54.230 --> 02:05:54.590]
Take care.

[02:05:54.690 --> 02:05:55.010]
See you.

[02:05:55.090 --> 02:05:55.190]
Back.

[02:05:55.810 --> 02:05:57.150]
Like Disney, boy, he's pretty boring.

[02:05:57.950 --> 02:06:00.010]
So he's, he's an okay guy.

[02:06:00.010 --> 02:06:00.770]
He's got a boring.

[02:06:00.990 --> 02:06:01.690]
Oh, okay.

[02:06:01.890 --> 02:06:03.650]
Well, that just wasn't what I was going to say.

[02:06:03.650 --> 02:06:04.270]
And he's Irish.

[02:06:04.530 --> 02:06:05.170]
What would you know?

[02:06:05.370 --> 02:06:06.310]
I noticed that's right.

[02:06:06.410 --> 02:06:08.030]
You never got a chance to speak to him.

[02:06:08.170 --> 02:06:09.050]
Thank God.

[02:06:09.130 --> 02:06:09.330]
Yeah.

[02:06:09.750 --> 02:06:10.910]
Why was he one of your favorites?

[02:06:11.970 --> 02:06:13.630]
That would be one way of putting it.

[02:06:13.670 --> 02:06:13.870]
Yeah.

[02:06:14.410 --> 02:06:14.610]
Yeah.

[02:06:15.110 --> 02:06:17.210]
I, uh, what do you want me to say about mine?

[02:06:17.210 --> 02:06:18.150]
Whatever you would like to say.

[02:06:18.530 --> 02:06:19.870]
Well, he's off the phone now.

[02:06:20.030 --> 02:06:20.110]
Yeah.

[02:06:20.110 --> 02:06:20.730]
No, I'm not.

[02:06:20.730 --> 02:06:21.690]
I was a good time to talk.

[02:06:22.230 --> 02:06:22.450]
Yeah.

[02:06:22.810 --> 02:06:23.470]
He's an LA.

[02:06:23.550 --> 02:06:24.110]
He can't hear you.

[02:06:24.290 --> 02:06:24.990]
Oh, that's right.

[02:06:25.330 --> 02:06:26.370]
No, there's nothing.

[02:06:27.450 --> 02:06:29.170]
I can say on the air about Mike Disney.

[02:06:29.190 --> 02:06:30.750]
So we'll just let it go.

[02:06:30.990 --> 02:06:31.610]
Just light along.

[02:06:31.810 --> 02:06:32.250]
It's, yeah.

[02:06:32.250 --> 02:06:32.310]
Yeah.

[02:06:32.590 --> 02:06:32.890]
Coast.

[02:06:33.210 --> 02:06:33.830]
Well, coast.

[02:06:33.910 --> 02:06:34.590]
No, that's over here.

[02:06:34.730 --> 02:06:35.710]
Oh, Annemarie.

[02:06:36.010 --> 02:06:37.150]
On the coast, Wendy Bennett.

[02:06:37.430 --> 02:06:39.070]
By the way, sure hope Wendy got some of the food.

[02:06:39.090 --> 02:06:39.310]
Okay.

[02:06:39.390 --> 02:06:40.790]
There's like 5,000 pounds of food.

[02:06:40.910 --> 02:06:41.090]
You did.

[02:06:41.230 --> 02:06:41.810]
Eat something.

[02:06:41.970 --> 02:06:43.530]
Please, Wendy, I'm begging you.

[02:06:43.810 --> 02:06:48.450]
Have you noticed since you were here last, Wendy Bennett, you have to look like real close.

[02:06:49.250 --> 02:06:51.370]
Like a, like a pencil, like a walking pencil.

[02:06:51.370 --> 02:06:52.510]
If she had an eraser, huh?

[02:06:52.710 --> 02:06:53.330]
She looks great.

[02:06:53.630 --> 02:06:54.790]
See, he's into that look.

[02:06:55.070 --> 02:06:55.330]
What?

[02:06:55.450 --> 02:06:55.890]
And our exit?

[02:06:56.070 --> 02:06:56.250]
Yeah.

[02:06:56.490 --> 02:06:56.850]
Yeah.

[02:06:56.850 --> 02:06:57.030]
Yeah.

[02:06:57.030 --> 02:06:58.710]
That's why he keeps playing all his carin carbon records.

[02:06:59.330 --> 02:07:01.110]
Yeah, he just relates to it.

[02:07:01.290 --> 02:07:03.170]
And, but she had to play the food I saw.

[02:07:04.230 --> 02:07:05.450]
I was on KAT.

[02:07:06.070 --> 02:07:06.830]
Some old fart.

[02:07:06.950 --> 02:07:10.710]
Maybe you remember it's one of our typical old nasty, wonderful, lovely, soft food of beach people.

[02:07:10.850 --> 02:07:10.950]
Call.

[02:07:11.330 --> 02:07:11.470]
Mr.

[02:07:11.850 --> 02:07:15.490]
You'll never last six months in this time with a goddamn attitude you'll got.

[02:07:15.630 --> 02:07:16.650]
You'll be out of here in six months.

[02:07:16.950 --> 02:07:19.750]
And the best part of it is we know he's dead or the noor nail.

[02:07:19.990 --> 02:07:20.110]
Okay.

[02:07:20.410 --> 02:07:24.890]
This old fart is pushing up daisy somewhere, probably pushing up weeds in a pickle pad somewhere.

[02:07:24.890 --> 02:07:25.890]
He's dead dead.

[02:07:26.570 --> 02:07:27.930]
And I'm excited to be here.

[02:07:28.050 --> 02:07:31.770]
If for no other reason, that motor to be motivated, but whatever it is.

[02:07:32.570 --> 02:07:34.370]
Use talk and entertainment radio.

[02:07:34.910 --> 02:07:37.890]
Six, ten, W-I-O-D.

[02:07:38.810 --> 02:07:39.770]
Well, see, that's good.

[02:07:40.110 --> 02:07:40.670]
It's selective.

[02:07:40.790 --> 02:07:43.310]
You know, as we get older, we pretend all my memory is failing.

[02:07:43.310 --> 02:07:44.490]
You know, I'm getting my Alzheimer's now.

[02:07:44.570 --> 02:07:45.610]
I can't remember who the hell you are.

[02:07:45.670 --> 02:07:46.770]
And of course, it's not by accident.

[02:07:47.610 --> 02:07:48.610]
Who the hell have we gone here?

[02:07:48.690 --> 02:07:50.010]
Oh, speaking of Miss Anorexia.

[02:07:51.530 --> 02:07:51.890]
Hello.

[02:07:52.550 --> 02:07:54.570]
Oh, she probably weed in one of her liners next door.

[02:07:54.570 --> 02:07:57.950]
Wendy Bennett, she's saying, it's 82 along the coast.

[02:07:58.450 --> 02:07:59.630]
That's what she's doing right now.

[02:08:00.070 --> 02:08:01.250]
And making like five bucks an hour.

[02:08:01.350 --> 02:08:02.370]
So who the hell can afford to eat?

[02:08:02.750 --> 02:08:04.550]
Wendy, it's only a four hour show sweetheart.

[02:08:04.730 --> 02:08:06.250]
Come on, we fed you this morning again.

[02:08:06.730 --> 02:08:10.010]
Johnny Dorx says he'll come in here and do like a couple of extra hours for you.

[02:08:10.730 --> 02:08:11.510]
What do we unhold?

[02:08:11.850 --> 02:08:13.130]
It's not just Hank Goldberg.

[02:08:13.630 --> 02:08:14.810]
It's a hip hop hot of us.

[02:08:15.490 --> 02:08:17.050]
How come we even had to call from Hank yet?

[02:08:17.150 --> 02:08:19.210]
No, the only reason I got that out of the way was so I could play.

[02:08:19.430 --> 02:08:21.230]
Johnny Dorx, then it's hot.

[02:08:21.450 --> 02:08:22.590]
Just so I can get that on.

[02:08:22.590 --> 02:08:25.230]
Just in case anybody forgot from yesterday.

[02:08:25.770 --> 02:08:26.570]
Wendy, are you there?

[02:08:28.070 --> 02:08:28.950]
Wendy, sweetheart.

[02:08:29.370 --> 02:08:30.310]
Okay, hello.

[02:08:30.610 --> 02:08:31.050]
Hello.

[02:08:31.390 --> 02:08:31.650]
Yes.

[02:08:32.030 --> 02:08:32.310]
Hi.

[02:08:32.610 --> 02:08:35.810]
You know something if I could scream this loud and write you the wall here too.

[02:08:35.830 --> 02:08:36.970]
Oh, break, I said hold on.

[02:08:37.250 --> 02:08:38.270]
From through a break.

[02:08:38.690 --> 02:08:39.230]
I'm sorry.

[02:08:39.570 --> 02:08:42.930]
What kind of crap are you playing right now?

[02:08:43.010 --> 02:08:44.150]
Who you got on right this moment?

[02:08:44.230 --> 02:08:48.690]
Listen, I got commercials going but I was too lazy to walk down to ten feet.

[02:08:48.890 --> 02:08:49.890]
So I thought I would just call.

[02:08:50.390 --> 02:08:51.470]
Well, thanks a lot, Wendy.

[02:08:51.470 --> 02:08:52.910]
I'll have to two zero, man.

[02:08:53.090 --> 02:08:53.970]
Yeah, thanks.

[02:08:54.070 --> 02:08:57.390]
I thought this party out there was for me but I was wrong for you.

[02:08:57.730 --> 02:09:00.090]
For you, we could bring in a teacup full of food and that would be enough.

[02:09:00.350 --> 02:09:01.130]
You know what I like.

[02:09:01.550 --> 02:09:01.930]
You know what I like.

[02:09:01.930 --> 02:09:04.450]
Your audience could totally be wrong and I'm pressing about whatever.

[02:09:04.930 --> 02:09:06.830]
You're a day man so I'm not going to spoil it.

[02:09:06.910 --> 02:09:08.450]
This call is from ten feet away, right?

[02:09:08.610 --> 02:09:09.770]
You hear the notice of quality.

[02:09:10.050 --> 02:09:10.270]
Yeah.

[02:09:10.670 --> 02:09:12.150]
Yeah, she's in the other room.

[02:09:12.230 --> 02:09:13.790]
She's on the other side of the same wall.

[02:09:14.270 --> 02:09:15.710]
I don't know if it's important things to do with that.

[02:09:15.810 --> 02:09:18.630]
No, but I'm talking about the great equipment we got in this building.

[02:09:18.630 --> 02:09:21.890]
The coxist is with $8 million internally within the building.

[02:09:21.890 --> 02:09:23.470]
You sound like you're calling from Uranus.

[02:09:23.530 --> 02:09:24.870]
Well, yeah, we could drink a ten-year.

[02:09:24.870 --> 02:09:25.930]
Yeah, it sounds like Larry King.

[02:09:25.950 --> 02:09:26.970]
You're on Larry King's left.

[02:09:27.330 --> 02:09:28.370]
It's like Larry King's left.

[02:09:28.430 --> 02:09:29.070]
Yeah, kind of.

[02:09:29.350 --> 02:09:30.070]
Well, thanks, Wendy.

[02:09:30.510 --> 02:09:32.910]
Hey, good luck to you in the next 20 years.

[02:09:33.010 --> 02:09:33.470]
Thanks a lot.

[02:09:33.570 --> 02:09:34.170]
All right, take care.

[02:09:34.230 --> 02:09:35.570]
He planned that glory as the fun.

[02:09:35.910 --> 02:09:36.410]
We'll do that.

[02:09:36.510 --> 02:09:36.890]
See ya.

[02:09:36.990 --> 02:09:37.250]
All right.

[02:09:37.570 --> 02:09:41.750]
So anyway, I guess Gloria and her husband are taking me out voting this weekend and on her, my anniversary.

[02:09:41.850 --> 02:09:42.710]
Stay away from her.

[02:09:42.810 --> 02:09:43.110]
Yeah, that's what I heard.

[02:09:43.250 --> 02:09:44.690]
Don't go too close to Gloria.

[02:09:45.050 --> 02:09:47.770]
If you see her coming down the road, just, you know.

[02:09:47.770 --> 02:09:48.130]
Turn.

[02:09:48.430 --> 02:09:49.050]
Just steer clear.

[02:09:49.190 --> 02:09:51.290]
I love those PSAs she's doing for safe voting.

[02:09:51.470 --> 02:09:53.190]
If anybody knows, you know what I'm saying?

[02:09:53.910 --> 02:09:55.570]
If anybody knows about safe voting.

[02:09:56.650 --> 02:09:57.290]
Here's Hollywood.

[02:09:57.610 --> 02:09:57.950]
Hello.

[02:09:59.190 --> 02:09:59.910]
Uncle Neo.

[02:10:00.270 --> 02:10:00.490]
Jess.

[02:10:01.190 --> 02:10:03.810]
I just wanted to wish you before I sing my song, a good performance.

[02:10:03.970 --> 02:10:05.250]
You and all the other Jewish guys there.

[02:10:05.510 --> 02:10:05.850]
Thanks.

[02:10:06.030 --> 02:10:07.150]
And an easy fast on Monday.

[02:10:07.450 --> 02:10:07.810]
Hi.

[02:10:08.590 --> 02:10:09.010]
What is it?

[02:10:09.150 --> 02:10:10.290]
Kind of faster on Monday.

[02:10:10.470 --> 02:10:10.870]
Oh, hey, V.

[02:10:11.070 --> 02:10:12.210]
I'm George to look it up on the calendar.

[02:10:12.690 --> 02:10:13.470]
So what does that mean?

[02:10:13.550 --> 02:10:15.350]
I'm Tuesday, Easter, Hamentation.

[02:10:15.470 --> 02:10:16.110]
I got a whole box.

[02:10:16.110 --> 02:10:17.910]
I got two boxes of Hamentation here.

[02:10:17.970 --> 02:10:19.570]
But you said you don't want me to bring it, because they've got...

[02:10:19.570 --> 02:10:21.130]
No, I'm taking them home to my mama.

[02:10:21.530 --> 02:10:21.810]
Okay.

[02:10:21.930 --> 02:10:22.330]
See you mama.

[02:10:22.670 --> 02:10:23.370]
I'll bring you some more.

[02:10:23.650 --> 02:10:23.890]
Okay.

[02:10:24.310 --> 02:10:25.610]
Anyway, here's your song, Uncle.

[02:10:26.730 --> 02:10:27.410]
Yo, Mahashana.

[02:10:27.950 --> 02:10:28.350]
Samaya.

[02:10:29.690 --> 02:10:30.490]
Yo, Mahashana.

[02:10:30.970 --> 02:10:31.370]
Samaya.

[02:10:31.670 --> 02:10:32.070]
Hi.

[02:10:32.790 --> 02:10:33.530]
Yo, Mahashana.

[02:10:33.670 --> 02:10:33.970]
It's him.

[02:10:34.090 --> 02:10:34.370]
Shani.

[02:10:35.350 --> 02:10:36.150]
Neil Rogers.

[02:10:36.650 --> 02:10:37.190]
Thank you, Ray.

[02:10:37.310 --> 02:10:38.110]
Like, yo, Mahashana.

[02:10:39.170 --> 02:10:39.510]
Licha.

[02:10:40.670 --> 02:10:41.530]
We love you, Neil.

[02:10:41.690 --> 02:10:41.970]
Beautiful.

[02:10:42.210 --> 02:10:42.690]
Happy anniversary.

[02:10:42.830 --> 02:10:43.250]
Thanks a lot.

[02:10:43.630 --> 02:10:43.850]
Bye-bye.

[02:10:43.850 --> 02:10:44.990]
Good, Purr-um.

[02:10:46.170 --> 02:10:46.310]
Good, good.

[02:10:46.310 --> 02:10:46.310]

[02:10:46.310 --> 02:10:47.070]
Nobody else have had people.

[02:10:47.070 --> 02:10:50.170]
Anymore, nobody calls up and says, um...

[02:10:50.170 --> 02:10:50.950]
Can I call my brother?

[02:10:51.110 --> 02:10:52.270]
Can I call my friend a douchebag?

[02:10:52.430 --> 02:10:52.970]
They don't do that anymore?

[02:10:53.030 --> 02:10:53.850]
Not quite as much.

[02:10:54.190 --> 02:10:54.970]
We kind of cured him.

[02:10:55.190 --> 02:10:56.030]
Happy Purr-um.

[02:10:56.170 --> 02:10:57.950]
Well, she still calls, by the way, the cockamone lady.

[02:10:58.030 --> 02:10:58.490]
Oh, good.

[02:10:58.910 --> 02:11:00.090]
But those things are past it.

[02:11:00.230 --> 02:11:01.230]
Oh, here's an important call.

[02:11:01.330 --> 02:11:01.530]
Hello.

[02:11:01.910 --> 02:11:02.250]
Hello.

[02:11:02.530 --> 02:11:03.010]
Yes, it is.

[02:11:03.530 --> 02:11:05.130]
Thank you for picking up my call.

[02:11:05.310 --> 02:11:06.590]
I just call to say happy anniversary.

[02:11:07.510 --> 02:11:08.950]
This is an important call, right?

[02:11:09.710 --> 02:11:10.650]
Oh, my God.

[02:11:11.030 --> 02:11:11.310]
Go ahead.

[02:11:11.370 --> 02:11:13.090]
What have you been doing for such a long time?

[02:11:13.870 --> 02:11:14.230]
What?

[02:11:15.570 --> 02:11:16.290]
Nick Lawrence.

[02:11:17.470 --> 02:11:17.830]
Wow.

[02:11:18.470 --> 02:11:19.830]
I didn't recognize your voice, Nick.

[02:11:19.930 --> 02:11:22.390]
This is the best producer and radio.

[02:11:22.490 --> 02:11:24.510]
The guy that got me those two male models from the...

[02:11:24.510 --> 02:11:27.470]
From the Elton John video I was talking about just the other day.

[02:11:27.570 --> 02:11:28.950]
That was my last active...

[02:11:28.950 --> 02:11:32.650]
That was his last act of benevolence and kindness and great deed.

[02:11:32.650 --> 02:11:34.350]
And I'll never forget it as long as I live.

[02:11:34.470 --> 02:11:35.350]
It is, Nick Lawrence.

[02:11:35.490 --> 02:11:35.910]
Yes, it is.

[02:11:36.050 --> 02:11:36.530]
Yes, Nick.

[02:11:37.270 --> 02:11:40.510]
In fact, we just heard your voice on that I prefer Stan Major, card two.

[02:11:41.210 --> 02:11:41.850]
I was on that?

[02:11:41.850 --> 02:11:42.990]
Yes, you were on that.

[02:11:43.090 --> 02:11:43.910]
My stuff was gone.

[02:11:44.350 --> 02:11:44.350]

[02:11:45.910 --> 02:11:48.290]
I hear that some of my friends are down there.

[02:11:48.430 --> 02:11:50.990]
I speak like a call and say hello and walk into much trouble.

[02:11:51.250 --> 02:11:51.430]
Yes.

[02:11:52.310 --> 02:11:54.410]
And what about when Steve's call coming in?

[02:11:55.130 --> 02:11:59.430]
Mr. Kane probably will try and call because he asked me what time you go off the air.

[02:11:59.550 --> 02:11:59.990]
Right.

[02:12:00.910 --> 02:12:00.910]

[02:12:02.470 --> 02:12:04.010]
Tell him when I come on the air.

[02:12:04.090 --> 02:12:05.510]
That's when he goes off the air.

[02:12:05.850 --> 02:12:07.650]
He forgot what time to show in.

[02:12:07.750 --> 02:12:07.930]
Yes.

[02:12:08.210 --> 02:12:08.550]
I'm sure he did.

[02:12:08.850 --> 02:12:09.230]
You're called.

[02:12:09.230 --> 02:12:09.730]
Don't worry.

[02:12:09.870 --> 02:12:11.670]
Don't forget Steve, we know you're listening right now.

[02:12:11.670 --> 02:12:13.230]
We're waiting for your call with Bated Breath.

[02:12:13.230 --> 02:12:14.610]
I'll make him get on the phone.

[02:12:14.690 --> 02:12:15.490]
Make him get on it.

[02:12:15.930 --> 02:12:16.710]
Okay, thanks, Nick.

[02:12:16.890 --> 02:12:17.490]
See ya.

[02:12:17.590 --> 02:12:18.670]
Nick Lawrence, there you go.

[02:12:18.710 --> 02:12:19.930]
That's a real guy right there.

[02:12:20.690 --> 02:12:21.090]
Yeah.

[02:12:21.590 --> 02:12:21.890]
Huh?

[02:12:22.110 --> 02:12:24.330]
He's going to be on the Mark Walberg show next week.

[02:12:24.510 --> 02:12:25.430]
On the Mark Walberg show?

[02:12:25.430 --> 02:12:26.410]
He is doing what?

[02:12:26.650 --> 02:12:26.830]
On the sixth.

[02:12:27.310 --> 02:12:28.110]
What's he going to be doing?

[02:12:28.130 --> 02:12:30.170]
He's got all these talk show hosts from all over the country.

[02:12:30.470 --> 02:12:30.630]
Yeah.

[02:12:31.090 --> 02:12:33.930]
I saw Randy Roode on one of those talk shows.

[02:12:33.930 --> 02:12:36.530]
I think he's going to be on a Danny Bono douchebag show as well.

[02:12:36.610 --> 02:12:36.850]
I think.

[02:12:36.850 --> 02:12:38.410]
And I'm getting ready.

[02:12:38.530 --> 02:12:39.250]
What is that?

[02:12:39.470 --> 02:12:40.710]
Oh, I thought you just left.

[02:12:40.970 --> 02:12:41.050]
Oh.

[02:12:42.390 --> 02:12:44.870]
More annoying than Latoya Jackson.

[02:12:45.310 --> 02:12:46.070]
W-I-O-D.

[02:12:46.230 --> 02:12:47.110]
Miami Ford Lutterdale.

[02:12:47.470 --> 02:12:49.350]
Use, talk, and entertainment radio.

[02:12:49.790 --> 02:12:52.330]
610-W-I-O-D.

[02:12:52.770 --> 02:12:54.650]
The best news, period.

[02:12:55.110 --> 02:12:56.870]
610-W-I-O-D.

[02:13:06.110 --> 02:13:09.370]
In-date in action in West Von A36 approaching the tow plaza.

[02:13:09.530 --> 02:13:13.090]
Accident clearing north on US1 to north of 304th Street.

[02:13:13.490 --> 02:13:17.590]
And keep in mind the Grand Prix of Miami kick-off today at the Homestead Mortisports Complex.

[02:13:17.990 --> 02:13:19.090]
Expect delays in the area.

[02:13:19.370 --> 02:13:21.670]
Especially the Homestead Extension other term pike.

[02:13:22.150 --> 02:13:23.270]
Emerald Palms is now leased.

[02:13:23.410 --> 02:13:24.710]
He's spectacular one in two bedrooms.

[02:13:24.710 --> 02:13:26.530]
As well as gigantic townhomes.

[02:13:26.650 --> 02:13:28.190]
Scott 233, 2020.

[02:13:28.810 --> 02:13:28.850]
22.

[02:13:29.030 --> 02:13:29.830]
This is marable.

[02:13:30.070 --> 02:13:31.910]
First six 10-W-I-O-D.

[02:13:33.650 --> 02:13:35.010]
Esos carros, Felizio.

[02:13:35.030 --> 02:13:35.470]
That is Neil.

[02:13:35.510 --> 02:13:35.830]
All right.

[02:13:37.610 --> 02:13:40.430]
The 610-W-I-O-D weather channel forecast.

[02:13:40.910 --> 02:13:41.790]
Partly cloudy.

[02:13:42.110 --> 02:13:43.250]
High around 85.

[02:13:45.270 --> 02:13:46.650]
84 degrees right now.

[02:13:46.650 --> 02:13:46.950]
What is it?

[02:13:47.150 --> 02:13:47.810]
I don't know.

[02:13:48.030 --> 02:13:48.930]
Oh, I don't either.

[02:13:49.270 --> 02:13:50.750]
You know, Neil, I feel really bad.

[02:13:50.930 --> 02:13:52.710]
I don't have an ass cake for you.

[02:13:53.170 --> 02:13:57.790]
All I can give you is my greatest respect and admiration and appreciation.

[02:13:57.830 --> 02:13:58.490]
Well, thanks Jennifer.

[02:13:58.670 --> 02:13:59.050]
We love you.

[02:13:59.110 --> 02:13:59.470]
I love you.

[02:13:59.530 --> 02:14:00.190]
Everybody loves you.

[02:14:00.310 --> 02:14:02.970]
I gave Larry a king-and-ass cake and guess what?

[02:14:03.470 --> 02:14:04.230]
He licked it.

[02:14:05.010 --> 02:14:06.130]
So anyway, you were saying.

[02:14:06.810 --> 02:14:08.430]
I can't give you a piece of it.

[02:14:08.590 --> 02:14:11.090]
But thanks for everything and congratulations.

[02:14:11.550 --> 02:14:13.310]
Well, when you find Vinnie, we'll sure a piece of that.

[02:14:13.430 --> 02:14:13.750]
Okay.

[02:14:13.950 --> 02:14:14.850]
I get in first.

[02:14:14.950 --> 02:14:15.170]
I get in first.

[02:14:17.650 --> 02:14:19.950]
We got a little pretty May I think.

[02:14:19.950 --> 02:14:22.930]
A station that delivers free sets.

[02:14:23.110 --> 02:14:23.790]
A library.

[02:14:24.370 --> 02:14:26.390]
A delivering sweet-hands.

[02:14:26.530 --> 02:14:27.850]
All weekend long.

[02:14:28.230 --> 02:14:31.670]
You can qualify by winning video cassettes of the movie deliverance.

[02:14:32.390 --> 02:14:36.290]
We require the tuneless and the radio all weekend long.

[02:14:36.350 --> 02:14:37.270]
The same thing.

[02:14:37.650 --> 02:14:42.110]
The grand prize winner will be flown to Doze in Georgia for a canoe trip for two

[02:14:42.110 --> 02:14:46.510]
down the Kahoodle-Lassie River, including accommodations in beautiful entry.

[02:14:47.030 --> 02:14:48.410]
It's easy to win.

[02:14:48.410 --> 02:14:50.270]
Now let's you just drop them back.

[02:14:50.570 --> 02:14:51.210]
Let's go to the right.

[02:14:51.490 --> 02:14:53.730]
All the pain is...

[02:14:53.730 --> 02:14:54.030]
Look, Mom.

[02:14:54.350 --> 02:14:55.410]
This is the 10th floor.

[02:14:55.550 --> 02:14:58.370]
Every time you hear that baby, it's going to like a bell.

[02:14:59.130 --> 02:14:59.890]
It's clean.

[02:15:02.470 --> 02:15:04.890]
It's a deliverance weekend long.

[02:15:05.190 --> 02:15:05.810]
We can fall.

[02:15:06.990 --> 02:15:08.330]
You're almost stationed.

[02:15:08.470 --> 02:15:09.310]
Get your word.

[02:15:12.010 --> 02:15:13.130]
You 95.

[02:15:14.010 --> 02:15:15.270]
You son of a bitch.

[02:15:15.270 --> 02:15:16.870]
Okay, 107 at W1.

[02:15:16.910 --> 02:15:18.210]
Scott and Laura Schwartz are here.

[02:15:18.390 --> 02:15:20.830]
Scott, of course, the great general manager of WTMI.

[02:15:21.010 --> 02:15:22.410]
You're a pseudo-inlectual classical station.

[02:15:22.410 --> 02:15:22.890]
What is that?

[02:15:24.210 --> 02:15:25.550]
Oh, it actually brought me a gift.

[02:15:25.630 --> 02:15:29.110]
It's probably like Mozart's greatest hits or some cock-a-round like that.

[02:15:29.170 --> 02:15:30.870]
We're celebrating our 25th anniversary.

[02:15:32.230 --> 02:15:32.230]

[02:15:32.230 --> 02:15:32.590]
Yeah.

[02:15:33.690 --> 02:15:34.410]
Oh, beautiful.

[02:15:34.630 --> 02:15:35.190]
That's a good pen.

[02:15:35.250 --> 02:15:36.930]
It's one of those like, what are those?

[02:15:37.210 --> 02:15:39.390]
Like a fank-mom block.

[02:15:39.590 --> 02:15:40.690]
Costed by 98 cents.

[02:15:42.170 --> 02:15:45.870]
And falling in love with classical music from WTMI.

[02:15:46.030 --> 02:15:47.290]
All you soods out there, baby.

[02:15:47.430 --> 02:15:47.970]
Here you go.

[02:15:48.230 --> 02:15:50.690]
Thanks so much to our good friends at WTMI.

[02:15:51.530 --> 02:15:52.970]
I only wish that their audience was alive.

[02:15:53.050 --> 02:15:55.050]
But nonetheless, they have a very high rank in it.

[02:15:55.070 --> 02:15:57.490]
And they're because they're all fancy, fancy and drive expensive cars.

[02:15:58.110 --> 02:15:58.970]
That's what they want.

[02:15:59.570 --> 02:16:00.350]
Here's Hollywood.

[02:16:00.430 --> 02:16:00.830]
Hello.

[02:16:01.630 --> 02:16:02.030]
Neil.

[02:16:02.290 --> 02:16:02.590]
Yes, sir.

[02:16:02.890 --> 02:16:03.910]
Hey, happy anniversary.

[02:16:04.130 --> 02:16:04.870]
Thank you so much.

[02:16:04.950 --> 02:16:07.530]
Last night when the screwed one got that penalty.

[02:16:07.930 --> 02:16:08.130]
Yeah.

[02:16:08.130 --> 02:16:10.650]
The potman gave you a tribute.

[02:16:11.370 --> 02:16:15.510]
He goes into his, he's there to say, un and a third.

[02:16:15.510 --> 02:16:16.770]
Oh, that's a bad break.

[02:16:17.110 --> 02:16:20.510]
And then he paused for a minute and then he went back to unbelievable.

[02:16:20.990 --> 02:16:22.310]
Un, believable.

[02:16:22.450 --> 02:16:24.110]
Yeah, notice he's been saying that a lot lately.

[02:16:24.250 --> 02:16:27.130]
I've had a tremendous impact on these even though she wanted to admit it.

[02:16:28.330 --> 02:16:30.050]
Yeah, those two guys are something else.

[02:16:30.270 --> 02:16:30.450]
Yeah.

[02:16:30.570 --> 02:16:33.210]
That last goal, they scored her about a 20 seconds.

[02:16:33.410 --> 02:16:35.010]
16.9 seconds left.

[02:16:35.130 --> 02:16:36.890]
It was one of the saddest moments in my life.

[02:16:36.890 --> 02:16:41.050]
For that, if we do that great job killing off those penalties and we're like just absolutely on fire,

[02:16:41.430 --> 02:16:42.630]
we missed the empty net twice.

[02:16:42.850 --> 02:16:44.410]
Two barns is like psychotic theory.

[02:16:44.410 --> 02:16:46.450]
He just can't put it away and the puck either.

[02:16:46.590 --> 02:16:47.530]
And then we blow it.

[02:16:48.130 --> 02:16:49.190]
But we'll take the point.

[02:16:49.410 --> 02:16:49.710]
Yeah.

[02:16:50.250 --> 02:16:55.050]
The Chris Mort says, you know, oh, they're saved by the Mb's broken.

[02:16:55.050 --> 02:16:58.390]
And there's like 20 minutes of dead air, 20 seconds of dead air.

[02:16:58.390 --> 02:16:58.570]
Yeah.

[02:16:58.630 --> 02:17:00.710]
And he finally comes up with, oh, it's in the net.

[02:17:00.890 --> 02:17:02.050]
Yeah, he said it trickled through.

[02:17:02.050 --> 02:17:03.630]
And I think he was talking about the puck too.

[02:17:03.950 --> 02:17:04.190]
Yeah.

[02:17:04.490 --> 02:17:05.270]
Well, thanks a lot, pal.

[02:17:05.270 --> 02:17:05.870]
Okay.

[02:17:06.050 --> 02:17:06.590]
Have a great life.

[02:17:07.490 --> 02:17:07.850]
Okay.

[02:17:08.050 --> 02:17:12.370]
So anyway, first of all, before I'm sure that Norma is going to get really emotional about the next call,

[02:17:12.450 --> 02:17:14.330]
but before we do that, what the hell was I just...

[02:17:14.330 --> 02:17:14.830]
Are you arranged to do that?

[02:17:14.850 --> 02:17:16.170]
Or you arranged the next call?

[02:17:16.370 --> 02:17:18.810]
Well, you know, now that we got JC here, this is small potatoes.

[02:17:19.310 --> 02:17:20.030]
How you doing, Brian?

[02:17:20.450 --> 02:17:20.830]
Hey, Neil.

[02:17:20.930 --> 02:17:21.470]
Happy anniversary.

[02:17:21.750 --> 02:17:24.990]
Here's the star of WFTL, a budding star on the horizon over there.

[02:17:25.530 --> 02:17:27.370]
I want to call two people, douche bags.

[02:17:27.710 --> 02:17:27.930]
Yeah.

[02:17:28.430 --> 02:17:33.870]
First, I want to call the Pizza Hut delivery man who came to my house yesterday morning in douche bag.

[02:17:33.870 --> 02:17:36.650]
And I'm always listening to you because he had you on in his car.

[02:17:37.410 --> 02:17:42.370]
And I also want to call my friend John, a douche bag, because he follows you around to every personal appearance,

[02:17:42.550 --> 02:17:43.530]
back he needs to go with him.

[02:17:43.550 --> 02:17:46.270]
And he always says, oh, Brian would have been here, but he didn't show up.

[02:17:46.270 --> 02:17:49.310]
And I said, well, in that case, why don't you get out of here, John, because I sure don't want to see you.

[02:17:49.490 --> 02:17:50.450]
So he is a douche bag.

[02:17:50.510 --> 02:17:51.790]
So why don't you show up, Brian?

[02:17:51.870 --> 02:17:52.410]
What's the problem?

[02:17:52.510 --> 02:17:54.230]
Did Norm get you all paranoid and nervous that night?

[02:17:54.890 --> 02:17:56.030]
What are you talking about?

[02:17:56.310 --> 02:17:58.010]
I mean, that night that you came to the Pizza Hut.

[02:17:58.290 --> 02:17:58.870]
Yeah, I remember that.

[02:17:58.890 --> 02:17:59.910]
My friend John tricked me.

[02:17:59.970 --> 02:18:01.470]
I didn't know that that's where I was going.

[02:18:01.710 --> 02:18:01.910]
Yeah.

[02:18:02.430 --> 02:18:04.830]
I guess that was the same way when Norm took your home that night.

[02:18:04.910 --> 02:18:05.530]
You didn't know where you were.

[02:18:05.610 --> 02:18:06.470]
I mean, it's just a joke.

[02:18:06.550 --> 02:18:07.750]
It's just a little joke.

[02:18:07.790 --> 02:18:09.030]
That's just a joke.

[02:18:09.330 --> 02:18:13.790]
How come Larry King said such bad things about you in the newspaper?

[02:18:14.290 --> 02:18:16.010]
But then, do you didn't hear his call before?

[02:18:16.550 --> 02:18:18.250]
He kissed my ass right here on the air.

[02:18:18.510 --> 02:18:18.510]

[02:18:18.830 --> 02:18:19.930]
My cheeks are blushing.

[02:18:20.050 --> 02:18:24.050]
Larry King kissed my ass right here on the radio from a call on a plane to LA.

[02:18:24.330 --> 02:18:24.930]
What did he say?

[02:18:25.530 --> 02:18:26.290]
Good question.

[02:18:26.550 --> 02:18:27.790]
That's the question of the day.

[02:18:27.790 --> 02:18:29.850]
Yeah, he was somewhat in coherent.

[02:18:30.050 --> 02:18:31.710]
But I think what he said was,

[02:18:32.250 --> 02:18:36.010]
Hi, this is Larry King and they don't come any better than Neil Rogers.

[02:18:36.150 --> 02:18:36.830]
Something like that.

[02:18:37.150 --> 02:18:37.410]
Yeah.

[02:18:37.710 --> 02:18:40.170]
Was he with one of those 19-year-old girls that he hanged out with?

[02:18:40.410 --> 02:18:40.810]
I don't know.

[02:18:40.990 --> 02:18:42.390]
You don't know more about that than I would, Brian.

[02:18:42.570 --> 02:18:42.850]
Uh-huh.

[02:18:42.930 --> 02:18:43.410]
That's true.

[02:18:43.630 --> 02:18:43.770]
Yeah.

[02:18:44.650 --> 02:18:46.690]
Anyway, Neil, are you going to be on the air?

[02:18:46.790 --> 02:18:48.070]
How many more years are you going to be on the air?

[02:18:48.430 --> 02:18:50.230]
I would say not too many, hopefully.

[02:18:50.730 --> 02:18:51.130]
Four or five.

[02:18:51.210 --> 02:18:51.870]
Four or five.

[02:18:51.870 --> 02:18:53.790]
You're grooming the seat for you, Brian.

[02:18:54.010 --> 02:18:56.890]
After you do your internship at WFTL.

[02:18:56.890 --> 02:18:57.710]
How about your internship?

[02:18:57.750 --> 02:18:59.030]
After you get into a real radio station.

[02:18:59.050 --> 02:19:01.270]
My community, sir, it is a real radio station.

[02:19:01.390 --> 02:19:01.530]
What?

[02:19:02.230 --> 02:19:04.130]
One thousand watts of power, man.

[02:19:05.110 --> 02:19:06.350]
I'll tell you one thing.

[02:19:06.350 --> 02:19:06.910]
I'll tell you one thing.

[02:19:07.050 --> 02:19:09.370]
Last night compared to QAM, you guys were a woman.

[02:19:09.530 --> 02:19:10.090]
I'm leading the game.

[02:19:10.630 --> 02:19:12.310]
QAM must be, now that it's been sold,

[02:19:12.450 --> 02:19:13.910]
they've cut their power out of two watts at night.

[02:19:14.270 --> 02:19:15.990]
You couldn't hear it like right outside the arena.

[02:19:16.490 --> 02:19:18.310]
And remember what a signal that used to have.

[02:19:18.330 --> 02:19:18.530]
Yeah.

[02:19:18.790 --> 02:19:20.570]
I think they're getting public service credits for that.

[02:19:20.790 --> 02:19:22.010]
Now, you've lasted 20 years.

[02:19:22.190 --> 02:19:23.510]
How long is Boy Gary?

[02:19:23.790 --> 02:19:26.790]
How many days is Boy Gary going to last doing morning's a J&L?

[02:19:26.790 --> 02:19:28.670]
What is up with that?

[02:19:31.530 --> 02:19:32.790]
This guy asks this question.

[02:19:33.510 --> 02:19:36.930]
It's Brian the board up and part time talk show host at WFTL.

[02:19:37.790 --> 02:19:39.390]
You're a full time talk host?

[02:19:39.430 --> 02:19:40.090]
This stays a week.

[02:19:40.250 --> 02:19:40.850]
At what time?

[02:19:41.210 --> 02:19:42.150]
All different times.

[02:19:42.450 --> 02:19:42.450]

[02:19:42.590 --> 02:19:43.170]
Or overnight.

[02:19:43.570 --> 02:19:45.030]
And then I'm on Saturday evenings as well.

[02:19:45.350 --> 02:19:45.570]
Yeah.

[02:19:45.790 --> 02:19:48.010]
Well, overnight's from like what three to five in the morning's

[02:19:48.010 --> 02:19:48.350]
three to six.

[02:19:48.810 --> 02:19:51.090]
So you follow the famous Mark Scheinbaum.

[02:19:51.430 --> 02:19:52.130]
That is correct.

[02:19:52.270 --> 02:19:54.270]
Who is a legend in his own mind in the industry.

[02:19:54.270 --> 02:19:55.570]
Oh, saying wow.

[02:19:55.790 --> 02:19:57.850]
Is it that guy that's wanted in 17 states?

[02:19:57.990 --> 02:19:58.130]
Yeah.

[02:19:58.350 --> 02:20:02.150]
I know that if I were working from midnight to three on a 250-watt radio station,

[02:20:02.370 --> 02:20:06.590]
I would say that I'm a legend in the industry too and be a member of the American Talkers Association like Mark Scheinbaum.

[02:20:06.870 --> 02:20:08.310]
Tell him you want midnight to three.

[02:20:08.450 --> 02:20:10.190]
Stick his ass on from three to six, Brian.

[02:20:10.410 --> 02:20:11.770]
Well, the theater bulge is listening.

[02:20:11.890 --> 02:20:12.490]
That's something good to find.

[02:20:12.490 --> 02:20:12.950]
There you go.

[02:20:13.170 --> 02:20:14.830]
Get this kid on when there's somebody still awake.

[02:20:15.010 --> 02:20:17.290]
Okay, don't put him on there where everybody's got their head on the pillow.

[02:20:18.110 --> 02:20:18.970]
So to speak.

[02:20:19.210 --> 02:20:20.070]
Well, listen, thanks, Brian.

[02:20:20.190 --> 02:20:20.950]
It's good hearing from you.

[02:20:21.030 --> 02:20:22.310]
And Norm says, love and kisses.

[02:20:23.030 --> 02:20:25.290]
You got off of there quick when I said that.

[02:20:25.410 --> 02:20:27.630]
A little out of it, I would say.

[02:20:27.770 --> 02:20:28.230]
What's that, Brian?

[02:20:28.490 --> 02:20:28.630]
Yeah.

[02:20:28.770 --> 02:20:29.770]
Well, he's under a lot of pressure.

[02:20:30.530 --> 02:20:31.910]
He's under a lot of duress.

[02:20:32.250 --> 02:20:33.470]
I think like a pink duress.

[02:20:34.210 --> 02:20:34.610]
Huh?

[02:20:35.330 --> 02:20:36.470]
So, yeah.

[02:20:36.830 --> 02:20:37.710]
I'm gonna come on.

[02:20:37.790 --> 02:20:38.150]
You can do it.

[02:20:38.230 --> 02:20:40.210]
Speaking of words, don't say a word just a second.

[02:20:40.270 --> 02:20:41.910]
So, Florida cries out.

[02:20:42.450 --> 02:20:44.990]
Take the bird and pluck him.

[02:20:44.990 --> 02:20:50.810]
Around the bird, across the bird, across the bird, across the bird, across the bird.

[02:20:51.030 --> 02:21:02.290]
Around the bird, across the bird, across the bird, across the bird, across the bird.

[02:40:36.670 --> 02:40:40.210]
we ought to take up a collection he's you know i mean he's going through a second childhood i mean

[02:40:40.210 --> 02:40:44.250]
when you're like 19 or 20 you know leave the house and you you just leave everything behind and

[02:40:44.290 --> 02:40:48.450]
you pack a bag and you go out and try to find your fortune when your day's age generally speaking
