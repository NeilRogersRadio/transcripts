[00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.720]
So we thank you for the cave by the way and back at you.

[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:15.540]
But this is, you know, they've done their very best, they've done their damnedest to kind of like sort through and see they could pick and choose and make sure that we start with a minimal amount of ability to succeed.

[00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.600]
Not that it's important that you do succeed in life but that your friends and former employees fail. Keep that in mind at all times.

[00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:33.980]
I was especially impressed with that that tape of the Aron and Ron replay last night that sold it kind of like that.

[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:41.220]
It was kind of typical I think as you give you an idea of the kind of technology that we've been saddled with here for the last several years.

[00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.800]
But keep in mind of course it's not supposed to be technology. You're supposed to come in and just make miracles man.

[00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:53.160]
Just sit in the chair, dummy up, don't cause any problems, don't make any waves and create a miracle for us please.

[00:00:54.160 --> 00:01:00.320]
Or else. Because it's not a question of if we're going to stab you through the heart, it's just a question of why.

[00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.820]
10 30.

[00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:33.540]
Woof at W.M.D. 3.5 hours for this kid till I just fly out that door head on down the street to the doctor to let him take a little just a little bit more blood.

[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.680]
Why don't they leave me alone already with that blood? I don't have that much left just leave me alone with the blood already will you doc go back to Italy.

[00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.520]
Here's a mobile in Cutlerage a date county call no less this must be important hello.

[00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:51.800]
Neil yes sir. Good morning. How are you doing? I'm doing great. So can I hold you for a time call I love your show.

[00:01:52.780 --> 00:02:00.020]
Great. I want to wish you well and you knew studios and my wife hates your show but I love it. I listen every day I work for you.

[00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:05.160]
Let's examine that for just a moment. What's your wife's problem? Is she some kind of a humorless bitch? Is that the problem?

[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:12.320]
Something like that. Isn't she getting enough from you? Is that the problem? Or maybe she's getting too much from me? That might be the problem based on your life.

[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:23.340]
Neil or maybe she just getting too much from somebody else. Maybe could be. Yeah. I listen to your show every morning I work for you to the company. Yeah. There's a lot of us out here that listen to your show all the time.

[00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:34.780]
I never listened or watch hockey before. Now I can get enough of it tonight's the big night. I guarantee that Panther Pack is long sold out this morning. I can't even work on that. I'm sure that.

[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:41.820]
I have a deaf. So I have the sports channel. So I'm okay. Great. You got the sports channel and 33. You can watch it in the stereo tonight, man.

[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:51.260]
I know. Listen. I wish you well. You know, you're the stuff you say on the air. Not nobody else can say what you say. I love your show.

[00:02:51.360 --> 00:03:01.580]
Nobody's got balls like these. That's what my doctor tells me. Neil, can I get a request? Please anything you like, pal? This is our last day. It's kind of a bittersweet moment in my life.

[00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:10.760]
Can I can you play that Castro song? The Castro song? Yeah, Castro. You ugly bastard. Castro. You ugly miserable.

[00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:18.380]
Comey Pinto. You fag. Is that it? That's it, sir. Okay. Sounds like it. Have a great day. Amigo. Thank you, sir.

[00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.640]

[00:03:48.540 --> 00:04:01.120]

If they will live

[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:50.480]
The embargo

You'll be coming to the key logo

[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:53.360]
USA

[00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:55.420]
USA

[00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.480]
We're turning all the raps and books away

[00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:00.940]
That's right Julia

You're a ghost

[00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.600]
Okay 1035 at WID Rick and Suds

[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:10.240]
From this building

[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.940]
Their last show in his joint this afternoon

[00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:13.480]
And Rick was over there last night

[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:14.540]
Trying to reinvent the wheel

[00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:15.760]
And do a pretty good job of it too

[00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:16.800]
By the way with our new studio

[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:17.480]
Our new equipment

[00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:20.720]
Our new massive very complex

[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.140]
And very space age

[00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:24.560]
And very shockingly and astonishingly

[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.000]
I can't even describe it to you

[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.620]
But I'll do my best tomorrow morning though

[00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:28.520]
While we're in there

[00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.300]
Pushing around and punching a bunch of buttons

[00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:31.500]
And making all kinds of sounds

[00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.220]
And you've never heard sounds like these

[00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:35.200]
I mean anybody can do stuff like that

[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:36.640]
But wait till you hear this crap

[00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:38.420]
And the sounds too

[00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:40.460]
Here's Pompano on the purple line

[00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:40.800]
Hello

[00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.360]
Well I'm in Hollywood now

[00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.000]
Here's Hollywood on the purple line

[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:44.760]
Hello Neil

[00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:46.660]
Here's Miami on the purple line

[00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:48.000]
Boy you're going like a bad out of hell man

[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.720]
Here's Homestead on the purple line

[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:52.800]
Are we gonna say cottage for this date count?

[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:54.320]
Oi

[00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:56.520]
Yes, good all, the Yuskidash

[00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:57.240]
Shamei Rabbi

[00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:58.900]
Yeah, yeah

[00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:00.160]
Well listen I gotta tell you Neil

[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.000]
I've tried real hard to list up till now

[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.720]
And try as the key word here

[00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:06.620]
I just can't seem to enjoy listening to Ron and Ron

[00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:07.640]
Oi

[00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:08.720]
Yeah

[00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:09.840]
I just...

[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:11.060]
What are you trying to say?

[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:13.060]
Nothing they talk about is relevant to anything

[00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:15.360]
Every commercial is for an area code 813

[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:18.760]
But don't you call me free

[00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:21.100]
Don't you pray like I do that

[00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:22.700]
January the 1st or 2nd

[00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:24.540]
Whatever day they get down here and start doing their show

[00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:25.420]
From our same studio

[00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:27.640]
That it might be a little bit more oriented

[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:28.880]
Like the local market here

[00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:30.840]
And steady here and about all those nose pickers over there

[00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:33.280]
I sure hope so and I didn't even know until just now

[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:34.060]
That they were coming here

[00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:34.780]
How do you like that?

[00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:35.900]
That's with this Ron and Ron

[00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:36.400]
Exactly

[00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:37.440]
Okay

[00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:39.480]
All right so I'll give it another try

[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:40.720]
I'll listen to I.N.Z only until

[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:41.380]
You worry then

[00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:43.240]
Now listen I don't know if you have any like goldfish

[00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:44.060]
Or tropical fish

[00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:46.340]
But if one of them starts swimming upside down

[00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:49.620]
We will be having a psychic on the show to help you communicate with them

[00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:51.220]
So you make sure that they're going to be okay

[00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:54.060]
But only if the fish was killed in a car accident last year

[00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:54.780]
Exactly

[00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:55.300]
Right

[00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:57.640]
Oh I have a very tasteless line for that

[00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:58.760]
But I certainly will not use it

[00:07:58.760 --> 00:07:59.520]
Have a great day pal

[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:01.380]
Oh it would have been so bad

[00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:02.040]
Very bad

[00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:04.600]
I mean as you know

[00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:06.860]
There's nothing funny about somebody's 18 year old daughter

[00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:07.740]
Dying in a...

[00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:08.740]
What what what am I missing?

[00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:09.880]
Line one

[00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:13.580]
Oh my

[00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:14.340]
God

[00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:18.360]
I knew that this was going to be a special day you know what

[00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:21.060]
Somewhere in my balls there was a twitch

[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:23.900]
And somewhere there's also a twitch saying

[00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:26.140]
Isn't it going to be great that we get rid of this DCS

[00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:28.540]
Even though you have this uh you'd like to use it as a crutch

[00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:30.320]
One thing about this building

[00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:31.720]
Takes forever

[00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:34.200]
To get that taste and smell

[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:35.280]
How do your system

[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:36.200]
Henry Barrow

[00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:39.560]
Another gentleman who's on our long list of former Cox grouis

[00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:40.860]
How you doing Henry?

[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:43.520]
Good I just wanted to wish your luck as you head to a

[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:44.640]
Real studio

[00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:47.240]
Right all I can say is

[00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:48.300]
Oh right

[00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:53.600]
I can remember when that room that you're in was the main AM studio in that building

[00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:56.840]
Back in about 64

[00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:58.940]
The main AM studio

[00:08:58.940 --> 00:08:59.340]
Yes

[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:01.060]
And what is it now?

[00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:03.420]
Now I mean for the disc jockeys

[00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:08.040]
There was a big console and they played all their records in that room you're in and the whole

[00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:10.600]
Well I see what you're saying it had the turntables in all that crap

[00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:11.580]
Right

[00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:12.820]
That's what it was you know

[00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:17.260]
Do you remember when I came here because I remember like it was a 20 40 year or 50 years ago

[00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:18.140]
Uh

[00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:22.140]
That was like the inauguration of this studio was just prior to that

[00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:27.640]
Steve King was doing a show in here and I think Steve Conway my good friend from the hockey game Steve Conway

[00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:33.800]
The teenage sound and financial guy was doing a show in here right and they had just inaugurated this thing

[00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:40.680]
Yeah, they just started putting the schmutz on the ceiling that's correct right and the dude's booth was to your right

[00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:42.640]
Right

[00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:49.120]
An open window there where they did the news right and uh yeah and then behind that was the news right

[00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:51.640]
So that's right

[00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:54.620]
Boy if you got a good memory for an old fart

[00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:55.480]
Got I spent

[00:09:55.480 --> 00:10:01.540]
Have with it at the time I left there I had spent more than half my life in that building isn't that something and I love the way

[00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:02.880]
They did it too. I love that

[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:08.460]
Hey Henry would you like to drive the overnight news van from two to five in the morning in the middle of liberty city and overtown

[00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:19.180]
And already they got a lot of very unhappy campers out there and that's great

[00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:23.800]
Keep them busy keep those bastards busy out there and see if the Cox people can really stand the heat

[00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:27.140]
Okay, that's what I have my dad. That's why we got the heat on iod now

[00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:31.840]
Now that Paxton bought the heat because the Paxton people they can take the heat

[00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:40.520]
The Cox people they put on a good act and by the way, no, don't forget don't say anything bad about the Cox people because we have that commonality of interest

[00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:41.380]
Yeah, that's right

[00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:48.380]
That's right my attorney had a call from their attorney. You know what I'm talking about like in Washington, Dallona's like Michael Hayes

[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.320]
The Cox attorney who represents the Cox

[00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:57.240]
And said you know because there's that boy Geary thing is still floating around that law suit and then that Larry justice thing

[00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:59.280]
Which even though I'm not a part of of of course that's floating around

[00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:02.340]
And so we have a commonality of interests

[00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:03.360]
Ha ha

[00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:07.380]
Now naturally not being having a death wish

[00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:09.700]
I'm not going to say anything that's going in anyway possibly

[00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:15.200]
Interfer with either one of those pieces of litigation in any way shape or form what would be the point

[00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:20.260]
Or the brine Cox litigation even though I'm not involved in that anyway shape or foam

[00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:25.320]
But other than that the idea that I'm going to say nice things about the Cox people

[00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:30.400]
I think is really stretching the point. I think it's really ludicrous and very juvenile and unrealistic

[00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:37.060]
Let's get into the real world Michael. Okay. Let's take a look at what it's all about because you'll also be on the list Michael Hayes

[00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:41.120]
I mean, it's just it's not a question of if it's just a question of when

[00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:48.100]
So hang on to that Vaseline jar very very very tightly don't ever drop it

[00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:54.720]
10 55 at W. I. D one hour down three to go

[00:23:56.460 --> 00:24:00.580]
As the realization begins crystallizing in that little part of my brain that's still functioning

[00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:05.480]
That we're going to be mosing out of here in just three hours

[00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:07.160]
Never to return

[00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:11.260]
Never ever to return. Sorry Terry. Why didn't come see us?

[00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:15.160]
That'll be a much more pleasant environment see the people over there all happen to be real nice

[00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:17.480]
And they don't hold any grudges

[00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:18.860]
yet

[00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:21.540]
But yeah, it'll be great

[00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:26.540]
And then of course you can see what a real radio station looks like. I know I just discovered it in the last couple of days

[00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:31.200]
A real radio station with real equipment and real engineers and real oh man

[00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:35.120]
I mean, you know what somebody when the outsider comes in here and takes a look at this place

[00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:38.280]
Oh boy, look at this. It's pretty good. It's not the worst certainly

[00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:44.600]
But it just could have used a little updating a little maintenance a little a little something to work with the last two three years

[00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:51.980]
That we run out of time in the DCS that we have like been doing shows out of a box out of a bag out of a sack out of a broom closet out of a cabinet

[00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:57.300]
Hey, now can you place out? Yeah, okay, wait a minute. Let me look through these 600 discs over here on the floor now

[00:24:57.300 --> 00:25:01.780]
They're not over there. Let me look through this crap on a ceiling. No, that's just among in the vents. Let me look. Yeah

[00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:08.800]
So there really hasn't been the desire because we're a pain in the ass and of course we do take people for these long nasty rides

[00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:10.540]
Up and down the old roller coaster of life

[00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:14.720]
And as a result of that we don't want to spend any extra money because we can't make any money

[00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:19.000]
We want to make the money. We want to make the big bucks like at WSU in Tampa

[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:23.800]
Which is now simul casting FM slush music all day after running rongo off in Tampa

[00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:31.960]
Which I think I think that epitomizes what this company is all about. I wish them the best of luck. I really do

[00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:36.780]
1050 did that sounds sincere what 1056 a WI would do

[00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:39.860]
Talk in entertainment radio

[00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:44.080]
610 WI O D Miami Fort Lauderdale

[00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:46.620]
This is the Neal Roger show

[00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:49.440]
This is your brain

[00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:52.560]
Any questions

[00:25:53.960 --> 00:26:02.420]
It's new from these discount productions yes potential car thieves be on notice you will now be thrown back from any car

[00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:07.720]
You try to steal with the piercing sound of the all new macarena alarm

[00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:16.860]
Yes of macarena alarm get yours today

[00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:31.380]
1101 at WI O D happy Tuesday to you it is Tuesday and it kind of lose track after you get involved in like all this other stuff

[00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:37.320]
That's going on we've got this momentous task of transferring like 70,000 carts and crap and stuff

[00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:40.500]
But it's kind of like a project. You know, it's kind of like a do-it-yourself project

[00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:43.340]
Thanks to all the packs and people again by the way you guys are great

[00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:48.700]
Man are they great and oh and if it weren't for them trust me none of this would be getting done because

[00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:50.780]
Well, we'll get into that tomorrow maybe

[00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:55.400]
We have two open lines and date and two and brown. How do you like that? I'm not giving the numbers out

[00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:56.760]
I already told you that you know the numbers

[00:26:57.460 --> 00:26:58.840]
It's your last day for those numbers

[00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:04.900]
It's your last day for this building three hours to go and it doesn't really have any impact because one thing about this town

[00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:10.580]
No matter where you're broadcasting from no matter from when you're emitting the sounds the audience they continue to be

[00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:12.880]
actively indifferent that's what 20 years

[00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:17.020]
And it's been no different. I mean the people have come and gone. They've croaked. They've been born

[00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:21.000]
They've moved out. They've come back. They've gotten off their banana boat

[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:28.560]
Whatever it is, but the one consistent thing here is the phenomenal active epithy the people who work 24 hours a day

[00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:34.660]
Even while they're sleeping to be indifferent toward human suffering toward need toward anything. I congratulate you on that

[00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:39.300]
Here sunrise on a purple line. Hello. Hey, how you doing? Okay, sir

[00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:42.460]
calling you on the last day here. Wish you luck. Thank you so much

[00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:47.320]
You're you're you're out to work is gonna change now. Yes, it is

[00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:55.060]
For better or for worse you get to drive by 95 now, huh? Yeah, but not very far now very very closer. I'll say a prayer for you

[00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:57.160]
Say a brah. Okay, pal

[00:27:57.160 --> 00:27:58.700]
One more thing. Yes, sir

[00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:04.660]
No, no hype for the Buffalo build this week. I started kind of quiet this week. Well, why not

[00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:08.300]
We're getting rid of all the malcontents now all the people that didn't do the job

[00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:10.740]
We're gonna have a lot of kids out there that they'll play with enthusiasm

[00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:13.960]
The people who are gonna be realistic dolphin fans are gonna

[00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:17.940]
Understand the what I said at the beginning of the year eight and eight a nice five hundred six, huh?

[00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:20.500]
That's fair. Yeah, that would be good

[00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:24.320]
And let's stop all the belly aching and all the crying and of course Danny with the injury

[00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:28.760]
I mean with all the odds against this eight and eight would be fine if we can sneak into the playoffs

[00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:29.680]
That would be spectacular

[00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:35.260]
But let's give this guy a chance and I think it's great that he's getting rid of all the dead weight right right

[00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:36.180]
Um

[00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:41.600]
What about you gonna start tomorrow at the new studios do you expect glitches or smooth sailing?

[00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:43.680]
Uh both

[00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:48.320]
It's gonna be fun to hear it. It's gonna be great. Wait till you're all the crap we're gonna have in there

[00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:50.740]
That's gonna be great. Okay pal. Good luck to us

[00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:55.540]
We have an open line on the purple line at you know the number now. I'm not giving out any more numbers

[00:28:55.540 --> 00:29:00.440]
I remember that period of time couple of years ago 57 consecutive days breaking Joe Dimasio's record

[00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:06.220]
Never giving out a phone number having every line in this board lit solid having an audience that was active and involved

[00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:10.840]
Even if they had nothing to contribute nothing to say just that wanted to be a part of the passing scene

[00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:15.620]
Now the way this community has changed so much. I mean, oh there he goes again

[00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:18.900]
That's right that bitch that called yesterday. I know you're out there today sweetheart

[00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:20.900]
You're not fooling me

[00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:23.140]
The one that never listens anymore

[00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:28.440]
But took time from her very very busy life and day to call me to give me a song and a dance about what a bastard

[00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:31.780]
I am and about how all I do is complain about what a toilet this town is

[00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:36.300]
I just make these things up sweet hard to be a bastard. That's all. I just make them up as I go along

[00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:39.940]
It's paradise here. There's nobody getting killed. There's nobody getting shot

[00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:44.940]
There's no problem with a lot of dumb people running around out there. There's no driving problem. There's no problem. There's no

[00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:50.340]
Political corruption here. It's just something that Neil gets on here and makes up to get a lot of people stirred up

[00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:52.100]
I just made it up bitch a sweetheart

[00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:57.600]
Boy, what I like to hear from her again because you know she's listening now that she's been made a celebrity

[00:29:57.600 --> 00:30:04.600]
That's what they all want they want to be celebrities and no matter how vulgar no matter how disgusting

[00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:10.440]
How grotesque your response is to them it makes no difference because once you recognize them once you put a

[00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:16.320]
Lay a stamp of approval on their forehead that at least they exist as a human being if even if a putrid human being

[00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:19.500]
Then all of a sudden they're validated their life has significance

[00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:22.740]
Here's a Hollywood hello

[00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:29.700]
Good morning Neil. When is Diaz happy last day to you. Thank you so much and in the spirit of bud pack two hours and 55 minutes

[00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:31.760]
But who's counting yeah exactly who's counting the second?

[00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:37.400]
I think tomorrow in honor of bud packs and you will Christian the new building yeah as it were and I'm telling you

[00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:41.780]
We're gonna baptize it sunny fox is coming by with a few bottles. Yeah, there's a certain motif running through the new

[00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:43.420]
What it's called the new regime?

[00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:51.320]
Lot of material from this morning's Ron and Ron and that was a pathetic call that was so you did you notice that even

[00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:55.940]
Ron Diaz seemed to be like like taking it back right because on the one hand

[00:30:55.940 --> 00:31:00.200]
He's got to assume the guy's telling the truth that the story about his daughter getting killed in the car crash

[00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:05.200]
Is true and on the other hand here's this pathetic guy calling in who wants to make sure that she's okay

[00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:11.000]
By talking to a psychic on a radio I actually turned it off at that point because his voice did sound true

[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:16.380]
And yeah something that I don't need in my morning right. I mean no wonder Dion warwick's rick it in the cash

[00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:20.580]
Yeah, I'm good. I've a listen to it. Can I have a little godfather music, please?

[00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:25.220]
Well, you know, it's interesting that we're actually able to find a few things in here

[00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:27.020]
I like that

[00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:33.180]
Okay, yesterday just to while away some hours. I watch it for the 10th or 11th time

[00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:38.140]
Magnificent godfather one. Hey yo, you got it three and a half hours work all right

[00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:43.100]
Fantastic and I did get a new line that I haven't heard before and I don't think you have it on a cart

[00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:50.240]
When Frado is going to Vegas. Yeah, I'm going to learn about the casino business pop. I love it. I love yeah

[00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:54.420]
I don't forget to pop pieces. I'm going to learn about the casino business pop

[00:31:57.240 --> 00:32:01.160]
One of the other great scenes with Frado is where after a Marlon Brando gets shot

[00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:06.220]
And he's sitting on the curb. Oh, he's got his head in his hands and he's rocking back again

[00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:10.620]
And even can't even hold the gun can't even cry for help. That's right

[00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:14.520]
He picks up the gun. He's like his hand is shaking and it just kind of like dribbles off like a

[00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:19.360]
A rotten apple core. Yeah, fantastic movie for those listeners that haven't taken the time

[00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:24.520]
It's one of the greatest movies ever. I keep trying to tell people if they haven't seen godfather released one

[00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:27.260]
They they're not even alive. They don't know it, but they're not living yet

[00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:29.760]
But we know three is trash. What do you think about it? I don't agree

[00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:33.560]
Don't agree. Well, I'm just saying some of the acting some of the acting is trash

[00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:38.040]
But it's interesting the timing of it too because now that this Pope seems to be right on the edge of existence

[00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:42.040]
And we're going to be seeing the smoke going up. They're going to be blowing a lot of smoke in the Vatican again

[00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:45.000]
Just you're right Michael Corleone is the same throughout the movies

[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:48.640]
But the copula daughter I start for me to yeah, stay in the room when she's on the guy

[00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:51.000]
She's she's enough to make you lose your any pasta

[00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:54.700]
So you're your community seems it's going to just uh

[00:32:54.700 --> 00:33:00.940]
Going half. I'm going to tell you something my trip home each afternoon is going to be 18 minutes instead of 40

[00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:07.600]
My trip in is going to be probably 20 25 minutes instead of 50 55 or 60 and you won't need your liquid bullet

[00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:13.160]
And I won't need my liquid bullet and I won't be driving into date county and I won't have to wait my way through the banana boat people and

[00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:19.220]
Life is almost worth living all right. It's time for me to sign off. I'd like to call my business partner bread angle hard a major league

[00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:23.440]
And it's always deal yet a goddamn grip on yourself. I'll read with her

[00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:26.520]
Come here

[00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:28.540]
Call with the broad

[00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:35.500]
See I'm the one that doesn't say it. Okay, we got that. I don't say it

[00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:37.900]
Got it

[00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:40.040]
Damn it

[00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:44.800]
Because I um, you know, I can use the cash

[00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:50.540]
Right that's right Julio

[00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:00.620]
You

[00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:08.840]
See little did you know that I find some useful carts on the floor on the walls in the Uranus all over the place here

[00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:14.580]
Some pretty uh not really interesting, but useful as in time killers look at that it's the 1109 already damn

[00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:19.940]
Oh, that was good. That's a new one anyway got a new line today. Hey, boy. You're working on it

[00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:27.360]
We have an open line in a brawler at 5249 463524 wiod that's very good

[00:34:27.980 --> 00:34:34.720]
He's expanding his vocabulary. He's probably uh got the message already for what we're gonna be writing back to management on the marquee

[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:38.960]
As we wind our way out of this building also by the way owned by Paxon enterprises

[00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:46.000]
I just thought I would mention that least for a dollar for one year by the Cox people, but still owned by the Paxon people

[00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:49.380]
So don't be pushing us around

[00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:53.040]
Here is a lot of deal by the sea. Hello

[00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:54.780]
Neil just

[00:34:54.780 --> 00:34:56.560]
I'll just want to wish you a via

[00:34:57.440 --> 00:34:57.880]
Oh

[00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:05.060]
Can barely hear you sound like this could be the last call well

[00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:08.380]
Thank you so much

[00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:18.600]
As you say

[00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:22.480]
Exactly and um even sunny got tired of driving over that causeway

[00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:31.800]
And yeah, I remember the first time I went down to the station to pick up a CD yeah, and I was driving down 79th street

[00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:34.220]
And beginning to wonder where I was going

[00:35:34.220 --> 00:35:35.380]
Ha ha ha ha

[00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:41.880]
Uh, it looked like um it looked like the aftermath of Andrew except Andrew had been years ago

[00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:47.260]
Yeah, see that's one thing if you're if you're not religious, which of course I'm not and you have doubts about heaven and hell

[00:35:47.260 --> 00:35:53.940]
At least the hell part when you drive down 79th street from i95 when you come east you know definitely there's a very distinct possibility

[00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:55.780]
It was a frightening thing uh-huh

[00:35:55.780 --> 00:36:03.220]
But uh in honor of uh you leave and neighborhood I was wondering if uh you could pray the uh macarena down the rea song

[00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:05.480]
macarena gonorrhea

[00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:09.920]

Okay, it's 11 after 11 at w.w.w. I would be we have an open line a day then one on the green line

[00:36:57.040 --> 00:37:03.380]
I just mentioned that you certainly do know the numbers by now after the 70 rated years that I've been sitting here pumping and pumping and pumping and pumping them in the numbers as well

[00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:08.080]
Here's a top 10 list. That's really pretty good about uh wide date is better than brown. However

[00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:10.480]
I don't do top 10 lists

[00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:17.840]
Here's a Jupiter hello. Meal. Yes, sir morning. So where you ahead are up here. What is it the range of hater? Yeah?

[00:37:18.100 --> 00:37:24.560]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, did you watch the game us happen to double-zund these flyers?

[00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:29.060]
I saw parts of that in fact I saw let's see what did I see I saw a little bit of that in the third period

[00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:33.900]
Yes, I saw that bullet shot that brooder missed that I guess the defenseman might have gotten this stick on

[00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:39.840]
Rearboard I'm what I'm talking about a stand fish. Did you hear that rumor? No, I did not he says that I watch stand fishler

[00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:47.360]
Well, he said that if primo and coffee goes to the whales that they're going to turn around and send primo and cron to the ranges for covewett

[00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:51.040]
Yeah, I think that's a good trade for hospice

[00:37:51.980 --> 00:37:56.400]
Hardford does got a death wish the only problem with heartford is that nobody wants to play there

[00:37:56.980 --> 00:38:04.040]
I know but uh, I mean, where's what's the crazy to give a primo and well first of all just because stand fishlers said it doesn't make it so

[00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:04.900]
Yeah, true

[00:38:04.900 --> 00:38:07.740]
Now if we could just trade one of our running backs to heartford

[00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:12.560]
And no seriously listen to me if we could trade one of the dolphin running backs to heartford and they do get Paul

[00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:14.480]
They could have coffee and kareem

[00:38:15.580 --> 00:38:20.740]
There you go well that might change their complexion as long as the ranges don't get shanahana per primo

[00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:24.320]
Well, I'll tell you one thing you better go tell lucrobatized wife to watch it

[00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:30.680]
You can't have her well, I'm just giving it a little word of warning. I hate you a little caution little yellow light there for the ranger wives

[00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:35.360]
How are we better win tonight? We're gonna kick their ass pal. I hope I hope messier don't play you

[00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:42.140]
I don't know I haven't heard but I you know one of the interesting things that's going on now and now that we're like at a total state of disarray

[00:38:42.140 --> 00:38:45.960]
I don't really know if we have the capacity to find anything out that's going on in the world

[00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:49.780]
I mean no one is sitting in there and there were you know pretending to give you a little news once in a while

[00:38:49.780 --> 00:38:56.000]
But as far as the messier situation if anything happens I'm positive. I'll be getting a phone call right great

[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:59.380]
But I'll tell you he won't be suspended because you have a show on doesn't do that to mess

[00:38:59.380 --> 00:39:02.400]
I don't think so and you know something I'd write I don't want to give them any excuse

[00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:06.620]
So let's watch him play and we'll still kick the rest that's good. All right, you know, okay me go take care

[00:39:06.620 --> 00:39:08.920]
See you we have an open line like I said

[00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:11.640]
There's no point in talking about tickets because the game is sold out

[00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:16.260]
They do watch it in your seat by seven ten the night for all the pregame festivities including of course

[00:39:16.260 --> 00:39:23.540]
The most important festivity at duena tonight the raising of the eastern conference championship banner and national hockey league for last season

[00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:38.480]
But the rick ronnie will be there with his son and some of us will be there with bells on and I'm positive

[00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:43.700]
That all those people in 106 tonight seeing the importance of this game these significance of the

[00:39:43.700 --> 00:39:50.640]
Great rivalry between these two sensational teams. I'm positive that they're gonna be on their best behavior tonight in our section

Here's West Kendall. Hello

[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:25.660]
Good morning, Neil. When is this happy last show?

[00:43:25.660 --> 00:43:31.240]
Thank you so much. What is it happy happy last show there in those studios. Yeah

[00:43:32.940 --> 00:43:38.380]
Yeah, I was listening to the to the run around show and a couple of colors were

[00:43:38.380 --> 00:43:43.620]
More than one were asking for the the reappearance of Don Shula

[00:43:44.460 --> 00:43:45.280]
All of a sudden

[00:43:45.980 --> 00:43:50.720]
No, they feel that oh no. Yeah, you gotta be you gotta be kidding. Oh, yeah

[00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:54.440]
They they one guy wanted to get down and pray for Shula's return because

[00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:59.240]
They felt the gene actins got a raw deal. I just wasn't conscious. Yeah

[00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:04.180]
You know that you know something the dolphins in their fans got a raw deal on Sunday from gene actins

[00:44:04.180 --> 00:44:09.260]
Yeah, absolutely who messed up the coverage on that last play on the touchdown pass

[00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:13.600]
From that five-year-old quarterback that frees kid for the Seahawks, right?

[00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:19.080]
He just consistently disappointed and stuck the joint out Jimmy is not gonna sit still for that kind of mediocrity

[00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:22.680]
Right, and I applaud him for that right. We don't have room for dead weight

[00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:28.780]
Right did you uh, did you also happen to hear the show when the guy I think his name was something ret from Tampa Bay

[00:44:28.780 --> 00:44:32.960]
Eric red Eric read the whole story articulate and literally did you hear that he's uh

[00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:39.000]
He's not too happy about that 14 million over five or six years because it don't start for like five whatever it is and

[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:43.260]
And uh for a guy his caliber who can barely speak the English language. That's pretty unfair

[00:44:43.260 --> 00:44:47.460]
There that conversation right there and itself. I'm not saying Eric is the most in articulate

[00:44:47.460 --> 00:44:51.920]
But he's sure is right there in the running the fact that this guy is belly aching about how many millions

[00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:55.740]
He's gonna get paid when he's gonna get it. This tells you what's wrong with America right there, man

[00:44:55.740 --> 00:45:03.140]
Well, I was embarrassed to hear the conversation because obviously he wants that money because this guy can't come out and sell cars

[00:45:03.140 --> 00:45:07.620]
Yeah, once he's off the football field right he wants the 15 million dollars in the bank

[00:45:07.620 --> 00:45:10.900]
Because the way he was talking I've heard fifth graders talk better

[00:45:10.900 --> 00:45:21.720]
I'm gonna be yeah, just had no no clue what was going on. Yeah, all it was

[00:45:22.360 --> 00:45:23.600]
Make no mistake about that

[00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:28.660]
Thank God that Brian Cox isn't continuing with his loud mouth disruptive behavior up there in Chicago

[00:45:28.660 --> 00:45:32.620]
Because that's the last thing a horse-crap team like the bears needs you know what I'm saying exactly

[00:45:32.620 --> 00:45:37.040]
Amen have a great day, Paul. Okay. Yes, see people don't change. They don't change

[00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:43.060]
They just move from spot to spot, but they don't change Brian Cox. He leaves here. He goes up there right off the bed

[00:45:43.060 --> 00:45:47.780]
He's on a crappy team, which we already knew everybody else thinks he's great. He's dynamite

[00:45:47.780 --> 00:45:52.060]
They don't have no F and heart that's the problem and now yesterday he wasn't bad enough

[00:45:52.060 --> 00:45:55.560]
He made the display with the finger and the whole deal on Sunday now. He's talking again

[00:45:55.560 --> 00:46:01.880]
Talking more trash about his teammates and they stink and they this and they that everybody else did same old crap as we had down here

[00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:04.520]
So basically Brian so much exactly

[00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:10.720]
We have an open line indeed. We got the pair on the green lines another one of those days here

[00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:16.060]
What it doesn't seem to be anything special on the outside, but then again, I don't expect you folks to be able to relate to the incredible emotion

[00:46:17.180 --> 00:46:23.060]
The the pathos and the ethos and the you can't you just can't relate to unless you're here on the inside

[00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:25.980]
Looking around at these formerly

[00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:29.400]
Fulips you with surroundings now almost barren I would say

[00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:33.020]
Does there happen to be a snapple in that bag by any is that flora stuff?

[00:46:33.540 --> 00:46:39.820]
What is that it's not food. It's good. He's hockey pox that we're not going to give away until uh we find out where where we can mail and how

[00:46:41.260 --> 00:46:44.040]
Yeah, oh we got some good stuff, but you're not getting it today

[00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:49.560]
or tomorrow or tomorrow. That's right and George made a good point during the break by the way

[00:46:49.560 --> 00:46:52.980]
Which I've neglected to mention since I'm so emotional here today and if you believe that

[00:46:53.500 --> 00:46:56.200]
Uh, and that is don't be calling us with requests today

[00:46:56.200 --> 00:47:01.280]
Now the guy the the kid that want to hear the Castro thing luckily it's in the DCS. It's still here. No problem

[00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:02.720]
It's there about a bing

[00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:10.500]
But I mean the odds of us finding anything. I mean this place is barren we're in a room with four walls a TV set

[00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:13.080]
Thank God the TV still there. All right. We got a better one over the other joint

[00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:16.320]
And and we also have our DSS hooked up you do know that don't you

[00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:21.620]
We got the two DSS's hooked up over there with direct TV. We got those hooked up in the new joint

[00:47:22.740 --> 00:47:30.720]
But generally speaking uh, we don't have uh quite what you call your great inventory of material here to dip into because it's all over the other joint

[00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:32.640]
What is that that looks like a plaque to me

[00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:38.000]
It's a picture of a joven asking a fight. Joven asking with whom?

[00:47:38.860 --> 00:47:42.720]
Doesn't say well, I'll take a look at that guy's bare uh, but there and I'll tell you who it is

[00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:47.780]
It's 1124. Oh, it's straight bear husky. Let me see that

[00:47:48.440 --> 00:47:51.960]
Open line and day and seven oh, I almost give the number out. Sorry. Sorry

[00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:54.080]
Talking entertainment radio

[00:47:55.180 --> 00:47:56.940]
610 W I O D

[00:47:58.220 --> 00:48:03.320]
Oh, that's right. That's right. We got to be careful. We don't know who the uh who despite the tattletails are over there

[00:48:03.320 --> 00:48:08.080]
Do you know what I'm saying? Because they've been very nice to us, but the engineering quarters they have what do they got?

[00:48:08.420 --> 00:48:09.800]
148 engineers at Paxenau

[00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:15.400]
So we got to find out oh max he ain't gonna be ratting on us max is a good guy because he drives a vet and he used to work on Zeta

[00:48:15.940 --> 00:48:21.260]
And smokes a good stoke and smokes a good Stogi so we can go to rat honest if somebody lights up a Stogi over there once in a

[00:48:21.260 --> 00:48:27.300]
Great one. Yeah, they gave us that crap and a big is no food. There's no beverage in the studio. Right lighten up a little rollo

[00:48:27.300 --> 00:48:29.720]
Okay, just kind of cut that little uh

[00:48:30.460 --> 00:48:33.860]
If they're ever where Simon's twins man, Mitchween and Roy Pressman. There you go

[00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:39.700]
God all the I think they must have some kind of a factory where they stamp out these cheap engineers out of a cookie

[00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:44.400]
cutter and I think they forgot to separate those two at birth boy. They are joy at the hip

[00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:49.120]
Will a train the Roy the same way we train Mitch that's okay. He'll he'll ease up and loosen up a little bit

[00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:52.020]
As soon as we do by the two sheer

[00:48:53.040 --> 00:48:58.120]
Which other than Zeta I think they would like probably beat the crap out all our other stations. Here's a poppano. Hello

[00:48:58.120 --> 00:49:02.500]
So you're gonna be working with Peter Bulger. That's right and he he happens to be a very nice person

[00:49:02.500 --> 00:49:07.320]
I will be working with Peter. Yep. Well, the end of the car's uh the bulger also right I understand

[00:49:07.320 --> 00:49:11.420]
They're looking to sandy patented bring her over. We are and uh in a box

[00:49:11.420 --> 00:49:14.560]
Ha ha. Yeah, not the truth my cut she must be about a hundred and eight

[00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:17.960]
I don't think a lot of people understood that she was actually even though I'm the air

[00:49:17.960 --> 00:49:20.380]
She sounded pretty good. She was not a really a nice person

[00:49:20.380 --> 00:49:25.140]
What do me they did not understand that I've told at many many times whether the people want to believe it or not

[00:49:25.140 --> 00:49:27.480]
But I have a good front have a nice day. There you go

[00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:30.400]
But the people inside this building who worked with her hated her like poison well

[00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:34.240]
I know but the people obviously weren't listening to you weren't aware of that have a nice day. Yeah

[00:49:34.660 --> 00:49:39.920]
But you'll see there's a segment of the audience out there like the bits that called yesterday that got all hostile with me

[00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:46.760]
I heard they're never gonna understand that it's a radio show right and that you can come off as sweet as apple pie on the ear and be a real

[00:49:46.760 --> 00:49:48.240]
Idiot and jackass

[00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:54.540]
Like a bastard on here and turn out to be a pretty decent person off the year. It's a radio show. She was one tough lady

[00:49:55.260 --> 00:49:59.900]
Have a nice day. Are you gonna have the same uh power that you have now?

[00:50:00.380 --> 00:50:04.100]
The same power yeah in other words are you are you gonna get out the same wattage?

[00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:06.000]
Well, we'll get out the same wattage

[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:09.780]
But the fact that we're gonna have a new transmitter in a two or three weeks whenever it's gonna be in

[00:50:10.360 --> 00:50:14.920]
I think it's gonna sound the signal be a lot better. No kidding. Yeah. Well, I think that's great

[00:50:14.920 --> 00:50:20.540]
You were talking about that so you got your new one yet the January comes out in January. It comes out January

[00:50:20.540 --> 00:50:22.420]
Yeah, and then let me see

[00:50:24.180 --> 00:50:27.000]
98 they're making the change over right? No, this is the year

[00:50:27.640 --> 00:50:32.160]
Oh, you're kidding. That's why it's coming out in January. Oh, is this the year that they're changing it right?

[00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:35.700]
It's 1984 right. Oh my god

[00:50:35.700 --> 00:50:38.780]
She's gonna look forward to that the only thing that damn price will probably be

[00:50:38.780 --> 00:50:43.940]
Well, it's not really the first change in cd4 because the LT1 engines only been in the vets the last couple of years

[00:50:43.940 --> 00:50:48.880]
Which is really a gigantic humongous change and I mean well, I'm talking cosmetically right right

[00:50:48.880 --> 00:50:54.420]
Well, have you seen it? No, nobody has seen it. Oh god. I'd love to get a preview of the darn thing

[00:50:54.420 --> 00:50:58.540]
Well, Jack libel. I'm sure when the first one comes out he'll be on his way up to Hollywood with it

[00:50:58.540 --> 00:51:03.200]
It's not the truth. I instantly it just for a guy. I want to tell you something funny or though you may not think it's funny

[00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:08.960]
I happen to know what Robert's all flushed like because I meant him at the wio d when I was on doing a show with

[00:51:09.840 --> 00:51:15.980]
But the hell I can't she's up for get us name now. It had any rate. I'll Smith. Huh? Bill Smith. No, it wasn't Bill Smith

[00:51:15.980 --> 00:51:17.420]
I had no

[00:51:17.420 --> 00:51:20.280]
First inler Craig Worthing. No, the guy that went up to JNO

[00:51:22.100 --> 00:51:27.220]
Michael ofine. No, my mind is going. No, he was like Miller Mike Miller. Yeah, Mike. Yeah, right

[00:51:27.840 --> 00:51:32.360]
We're on we're talking about old cars and what I mean that's probably that was probably one of the last shows he did there

[00:51:32.360 --> 00:51:37.060]
But at any grade I saw Robert's off in a restaurant the other day because he was there with Sandy Payton

[00:51:37.060 --> 00:51:39.120]
And I walked in so I know what he looks like

[00:51:39.120 --> 00:51:42.120]
Yeah, and he was in a restaurant up here in poppin of beach

[00:51:42.120 --> 00:51:45.660]
And I was gonna blow his cover, but then I figured nothing worse than a restaurant

[00:51:45.660 --> 00:51:50.480]
Critic who's recognized by the people inside all the restaurants so when he comes in they put on like an extra special deal

[00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:55.480]
Yeah, I know it will obviously bad. Obviously nobody has a clue what he looks like and of course I didn't blow his cover

[00:51:55.480 --> 00:52:00.180]
But I mentioned it to my wife. I said hey, do you know who that is over there? And she said no who I said this Robert's all yeah

[00:52:00.180 --> 00:52:05.340]
So he was a critiquing a restaurant, but I would love to keep you all to myself. Yeah, thanks Andy

[00:52:05.340 --> 00:52:10.080]
But anyway, it doesn't look like he's been missing any meals. I'll tell you that really oh, yeah

[00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:14.000]
Well, when you eat for free trust me what I tell you. It's uh, it's the way to go. You got it

[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:16.180]
Have a great day pal. Good luck. Speaking of the way to go

[00:52:16.620 --> 00:52:19.080]
You know what I think is gonna happen in the next couple of minutes George

[00:52:20.860 --> 00:52:23.160]
Another momentous event. Do you know what it is?

[00:52:24.260 --> 00:52:29.520]
Well, just stop and think about it. I just ate some really delicious, but slightly greasy food from Ray's diner. Oh, yeah

[00:52:30.020 --> 00:52:31.280]
The bathrooms on the same floor

[00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:34.780]
That's right the bathrooms on the same floor at Paxon boys

[00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:39.700]
Although very very far away and we have very short break so man get out your tracks shoes

[00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:46.440]
Get out your Nike's of course. Do you know I'm gonna tell you how far that Nike this this infestation of our society

[00:52:46.980 --> 00:52:48.620]
All over the world not just in America

[00:52:49.220 --> 00:52:52.540]
But on a scoreboard on the hockey scoreboard on hockey night in Canada

[00:52:53.060 --> 00:52:58.660]
I'm watching because I taped I went to bed like after the first period of the Vancouver Calgary games Saturday night the second game

[00:52:59.780 --> 00:53:04.880]
And I'm fast forwarding through to see the highlights and low lights and whatever in the outcome of these late games

[00:53:04.880 --> 00:53:11.680]
And sure enough on the scoreboard they've got the Nike logo in the upper right hand corner on hockey night in Canada

[00:53:12.240 --> 00:53:14.540]
And I said oh my god

[00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:16.960]
Can this really be happening to us

[00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:24.320]
So I think right now and I've been you know, I would have preferred to avoid it this if I could but I think I might just have to

[00:53:25.140 --> 00:53:26.580]
My last dump

[00:53:27.440 --> 00:53:30.640]
At W.I.O.D. in North table my last

[00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:31.620]
Georgate equipment

[00:53:32.540 --> 00:53:33.100]
folks

[00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:35.520]
I'd like to see the song about

[00:53:37.100 --> 00:53:39.680]
About me about you

[00:53:40.360 --> 00:53:44.500]
About the way our American hearts beat way down a bottom of our chest

[00:53:45.340 --> 00:53:48.720]
About that special feeling we get in the cockles for house

[00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:52.260]
In the bowl of the cockles maybe in the subcock where we get

[00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:55.440]
Maybe in the liver maybe in the jingles

[00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:58.680]
Maybe even in the cold and we don't

[00:54:01.320 --> 00:54:06.460]
Well, I'm just a regular Joe with a regular job

[00:54:07.040 --> 00:54:10.520]
I'm your average white superman ice

[00:54:10.520 --> 00:54:12.980]
I like football and

[00:54:12.980 --> 00:54:23.580]
Tornow books about you. I got an average house where the nice hardwood floor my wife and my job my kids in my car

[00:54:23.580 --> 00:54:26.580]
Off you down my table and a huge

[00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:33.060]
But sometimes I just

[00:54:33.060 --> 00:54:35.940]
Ain't enough to keep a man like me

[00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:37.900]
Oh, no, no

[00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:44.620]
I've got to go out and have fun and someone else is expensive

[00:54:44.620 --> 00:54:48.040]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[00:54:48.040 --> 00:54:49.120]
I try really

[00:54:50.240 --> 00:54:52.040]
In the olds for fast lane

[00:54:52.040 --> 00:54:55.400]
While people behind me are going to

[00:55:04.080 --> 00:55:05.080]
Instead

[00:55:05.080 --> 00:55:05.080]

[00:55:05.080 --> 00:55:07.240]
Public toilets and I

[00:55:07.240 --> 00:55:12.960]
Saw the seat I walk around in the summer times and I

[00:55:20.120 --> 00:55:22.080]
I'm on a

[00:55:22.080 --> 00:55:22.080]

[00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:29.040]
Spaces while handicapped people make handicaps

[00:55:42.960 --> 00:55:43.940]
And raising

[00:55:46.720 --> 00:55:49.520]
Maybe they're right where they tell me

[00:56:00.520 --> 00:56:07.820]
You know what I'm gonna do I'm gonna get myself a 1967 panel. I killed a rattle

[00:56:09.160 --> 00:56:09.760]
A

[00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:13.000]
Whales in a half a cat and all other cow in

[00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:15.400]
Period and big brown baby seal eyes

[00:56:15.400 --> 00:56:15.900]
My

[00:56:17.400 --> 00:56:18.000]
Baby

[00:56:19.540 --> 00:56:21.260]
One mile per gallon

[00:56:21.260 --> 00:56:22.420]
Forty-five

[00:56:23.100 --> 00:56:28.420]
The old fashioned by the great of all styrofoam containers and what I'm done second down those three small burgers

[00:56:28.420 --> 00:56:33.280]
I'm gonna wipe my mouth with the American flag and then I'm gonna toss the styrofoam containers right off the side

[00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:33.880]
And right now

[00:56:33.880 --> 00:56:35.880]
God damn thing anybody can do about it

[00:56:35.880 --> 00:56:42.700]
You know why because we got the bomb that's why two words nuclear and weapons of day Russia Germany

[00:56:42.700 --> 00:56:46.280]
From any of they can have all the democracy they want thinking of a big democracy

[00:56:46.280 --> 00:56:51.120]
Can walk right through the middle of the enemy square and it won't make a lick of difference because we got the bomb

[00:56:51.120 --> 00:56:55.660]
So dad John Wayne's not dead he's frozen and as soon as we find a cure for cancer

[00:56:55.660 --> 00:56:58.000]
We're gonna throw out that dude and he's gonna be pretty pissed off

[00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:00.060]
You know why I'm gonna be taking a cold shower

[00:57:00.060 --> 00:57:03.660]
We'll multiply that by 15 million times that's how pissed off the food is gonna be

[00:57:03.660 --> 00:57:06.940]
I'm gonna get a doodling and John has the veggies and leave arm and then sand

[00:57:06.940 --> 00:57:10.020]
Second boy and a case away and dry down a day safe

[00:57:10.020 --> 00:57:11.580]
You know you really aren't at all

[00:57:11.580 --> 00:57:13.740]
But you just shut up and sing this song, pal

[00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:45.100]
I'm an asshole and I'm proud of it

[00:57:45.100 --> 00:57:48.940]
So Cheryl says what's tomorrow's you're gonna be like I guess you'll be tuning in to find out sweetheart

[00:57:52.080 --> 00:57:55.640]
I'm sure that it'll be blasting in the hallways just to keep him awake in this joint

[00:57:56.460 --> 00:58:01.620]
1138 at W.I.O.D. I want to tell you one thing my last dump in this building was a masculine dump

[00:58:02.280 --> 00:58:04.760]
Oh God it was so rewarding

[00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:10.300]
And I left some little advice for the employees on the walls down there

[00:58:10.300 --> 00:58:12.860]
In fact, I just wrote a simple message on the restroom wall

[00:58:14.120 --> 00:58:15.600]
It's not a question of if

[00:58:18.060 --> 00:58:19.620]
It's just a question of when

[00:58:21.140 --> 00:58:24.720]
And that comes in real handy like if you're on the Atkins you know and you're real bound up inside

[00:58:24.720 --> 00:58:27.980]
And you're sitting there wondering is it ever gonna happen just look at that message

[00:58:27.980 --> 00:58:30.180]
And psychologically any second

[00:58:30.780 --> 00:58:32.860]
You should be rewarded with great success

[00:58:32.860 --> 00:58:36.700]
By the way, thanks to Mike Silver is from going going going gone

[00:59:21.240 --> 00:59:25.000]
Anyway, so just to get out of here a bag. We got a bag full of them

[00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:29.400]
And we got some really nice plaques too by the way, which I'm keeping thank you Mike

[00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:32.580]
Here's Miami on the purple line. Hello

[00:59:34.120 --> 00:59:35.560]
Miami on the purple line

[00:59:38.920 --> 00:59:44.180]
Yes, sir, I'm sorry. That's okay. I apologize. I was out of the vehicle for a minute there. That's all right

[00:59:44.180 --> 00:59:46.980]
I was out of the room for I was out of the room for two and a half minutes to

[00:59:47.820 --> 00:59:52.040]
I hope your time was spent as well as mine. It was my I just watched my hands too. All right

[00:59:52.500 --> 00:59:57.680]
I made a I want to make a real quick comment and reference to some days game. Is that me? Yes, sir

[00:59:58.780 --> 01:00:00.120]
Most of us that were out there

[01:00:00.840 --> 01:00:08.700]
We were getting our butt soaked so I had I was soaking wet and I think the performance of the team was not bad overall

[01:00:08.700 --> 01:00:09.760]
I think

[01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:12.580]
Eric's been played fairly well

[01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:17.860]
Uh, there's a few foam moves because of the rain. Of course the bog is whether it's hard to keep up with that ball

[01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:20.180]
And I think uh

[01:00:20.740 --> 01:00:23.840]
Mr. Jimmy Johnson he did the right move getting rid of gene acting amen

[01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:29.920]
There might be a couple of more players that uh need to get you know need to get get rid of them too like JB Brown right?

[01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:37.220]
I'm sorry like JB Brown. I think uh that's on top of the list. Yeah, and you know these people have to get used to Jimmy

[01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:41.300]
Uh, I don't think he's uh, a type of coach that he likes to lose

[01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:45.180]
Uh, why he's got those two rings uh, it's because he likes to win

[01:00:45.180 --> 01:00:50.380]
That's right. He's not going to sit back and keep a bunch of losers on the team guys that keeps screwing up over and over again

[01:00:50.380 --> 01:00:53.220]
And keep in mind a guy like gene actins with his experience

[01:00:53.220 --> 01:00:55.720]
He's not going to get any better. Do you know what I'm saying in other words?

[01:00:55.880 --> 01:00:59.180]
He's not a rookie. He's not somebody who at this stage of his career ought to be learning

[01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:04.260]
He's either going to do it or not and he's not getting the job done and he's gone and that's it and I like that approach

[01:01:04.260 --> 01:01:06.620]
He's slowing down and uh, you know

[01:01:06.620 --> 01:01:12.480]
When you the older you get the slower you get and you'll react as well as you'll when you're 20 or 25 year old uh, young male

[01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:18.840]
And uh, I think don't that's all I want to say about the game itself and last night I watched part of that uh

[01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:24.360]
The uh that dolphin so they have like I kept at it with that hand goldberg honor. Yeah

[01:01:24.780 --> 01:01:29.540]
God is he ugly. I've never seen somebody as ugly as he is. Yeah, I turned it off for a year

[01:01:29.540 --> 01:01:33.580]
Some of you know some of us have a face for radio the Humper's got a face and a body for radio

[01:01:33.580 --> 01:01:38.480]
He's got the face like a hit line. Yeah, you've got a cut. You've got a cut to somebody says uh, he's not only

[01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:43.400]
Fatty. He's just gonna have a pot of something like that something like that. Yeah. It's not just paint goldberg

[01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:48.480]
It's a hip-hop. Yeah, something like that. He looks just like one. Yeah, my daughter has a little book

[01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:50.260]
I had a piggy book and I went and looked up

[01:01:50.260 --> 01:01:55.300]
Space and I got a mind he looks just like one. He's a monster in the gambling business. Make no mistake about him

[01:01:55.300 --> 01:01:59.900]
Listen to another thing in other thing I net smith and Joseph Gackie on together on QAM

[01:01:59.900 --> 01:02:05.660]
No. 3 you can't complain about the personality on that show because they don't have any I want to what a pairing that is

[01:02:05.660 --> 01:02:09.900]
I don't listen to them at the end of the game. I just shut the radio off and put something else. I cannot listen to them

[01:02:09.900 --> 01:02:14.000]
Another point I wanted to make out says you guys normally give our good stuff away. Yeah

[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:17.920]
Yeah, most of your freebie listeners that they like to go pick up the stuff now

[01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:21.720]
It'll be closer to them cause all I gotta do is get up by 95. There you go excellent point

[01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:26.780]
We can you know something we can throw it over the fence right out of 95. They don't even have to come into parking lot

[01:02:26.780 --> 01:02:29.400]
That's excellent excellent excellent. Have a great life pal

[01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:30.240]
Good looks you good

[01:02:31.380 --> 01:02:36.300]
Well, he said good luck. Here's a rumor who's gonna be on briefly. Hello

[01:02:43.060 --> 01:02:48.040]
This is a setup deal okay. No, I've been hit. Yes. It is. This is a setup deal if I ever saw

[01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:52.780]
Oh, it's not how can you how can you possibly be hanging around with that guy after what he said about your anatomy?

[01:02:52.780 --> 01:02:57.160]
I mean I'd be embarrassed by that. I don't know. He's been looking at me a little weird. That's what I'm saying

[01:02:57.160 --> 01:03:01.860]
Well, you know what? Come to stick with Denise. Okay, they make it they make a dashing couple. Yeah, he

[01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:06.760]
Sounded he had a couple holes in his pocket. So he's going around dressed and find all those change. Yeah

[01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:07.580]

Okay, 1144 well we're up against a break now. I can't I'm already two minutes behind he'll wait you think he's going somewhere

[01:03:30.920 --> 01:03:33.000]
Boy, what a setup deal that was

[01:03:33.980 --> 01:03:40.040]
And I hope when we come back you don't make any more comments about the guys penises on the team. I mean that's that's like something we do on the worst team

[01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:43.160]
Talking entertainment radio

[01:03:45.820 --> 01:03:47.760]
16 W I O D

[01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:52.520]
This is right for a senior writer with the hockey news. They don't come any better than Neil Roger

[01:03:52.520 --> 01:03:55.460]
1148 to W I D. Thank you so much for waiting rimmer

[01:03:55.460 --> 01:04:01.020]
Well, did you expect everything else? No, I know you're not going anywhere. I'm pretty bad. Who's doing a game tonight?

[01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:03.060]
Obviously this this show

[01:04:03.700 --> 01:04:06.500]
Must be kicking some butt because it's a lot of commercial time

[01:04:08.380 --> 01:04:14.720]
Anyway, yeah, how are you great? I just wanted to call you and kind of an offer to talk you set the sea

[01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:19.660]
There's no sucking there. I'm just speaking in in real as an offer to talk. Yeah

[01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:25.600]
And enough of these setup calls to by the way. Well, there's no setup call. I had to run out and get some information

[01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:31.560]
You had to run, so funny. I had the same problem. What's that? I said I had the same movement just moments ago

[01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:33.780]
So it goes to show a great behind minds work alike

[01:04:33.780 --> 01:04:39.300]
Well, let me just tell you I had to run away for a sec and get some information because you you wind and complain

[01:04:39.300 --> 01:04:43.540]
I didn't tell you about Ray Shepherd when he was hurt who's now don't tell me somebody else has heard

[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:47.740]
No, in fact, it's good news tonight with a season opener and of course the banner

[01:04:48.360 --> 01:04:56.600]
Raising tonight Ray Shepherd will play tonight really yes, whoo heavy duty. That's some big news here at that great news

[01:04:56.600 --> 01:05:00.320]
The panthers practice facility. So who's gonna be sitting nude?

[01:05:00.820 --> 01:05:04.320]
Uh, I would think it'll be Brad Smith. Uh-huh. That's right rookie. Yeah

[01:05:04.920 --> 01:05:09.980]
And it's not because Brad played play pretty well, but the rookies always you know, they get a little bench time

[01:05:09.980 --> 01:05:14.660]
Yeah, but the the good news is that Ray and I talked to him here just the moment of going in fact

[01:05:14.660 --> 01:05:16.260]
That's why Paul was holding for me

[01:05:16.260 --> 01:05:17.480]
Ray said that

[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:23.580]
They told him soon as the pain went away. He could play the pain's gone away great a medical clearance like yesterday practice

[01:05:23.580 --> 01:05:29.900]
Oh, we're gonna be dangerous now just stop and think that we won our first two games on the road against two pretty highly touted teams

[01:05:29.900 --> 01:05:34.120]
Without Ray Shepherd our leading goal scorer and we were all for ten on the power plan

[01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:35.120]
I told Doug McLean

[01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:38.520]
I said we've got the McLean show coming up later this week and if you don't want some

[01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:40.600]
Severe criticism you better get the power play going

[01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:44.240]
I want to see Stracca out there and at power play with shepherds, but I want to see

[01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:49.180]
Well Ray Shepherd is playing tonight. He'll play alongside the stew barns and

[01:05:49.180 --> 01:05:53.840]
Let's hope that the panthers can scorn the power play and make it three and oh with the banner raising tonight

[01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:58.600]
It's a historic night and have we heard anything about messier and self-lord and know the panthers are waiting to hear

[01:05:58.600 --> 01:06:00.980]
But you have to understand the panthers world here

[01:06:01.860 --> 01:06:07.700]
Other than from the media because the Rangers will be notified later today whether or not messier will be or won't be suspended

[01:06:07.700 --> 01:06:11.000]
Yeah, of course made the trip with the team last night

[01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:14.080]
Is practicing at the Miami arena right now and of course

[01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:19.540]
He'll learn later on this afternoon from Brian Burke whether or not you'll be suspended my feeling is now

[01:06:20.040 --> 01:06:21.780]
As unjust as it is he won't be

[01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:26.720]
He should be but you know something like I said it to a caller before I'd rather than he did play

[01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:30.260]
Because I don't want any Ranger fans crying excuses, you know

[01:06:30.260 --> 01:06:34.860]
I'd like to beat him with our full team against their whole team and we'll beat him right down to the ice

[01:06:34.860 --> 01:06:37.940]
We'll just pulverize him well whatever it takes we got to tell you again

[01:06:37.940 --> 01:06:41.680]
Mike Richter nine goals in two games not too great a not too good

[01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:48.160]
I think he shot his big load in a world cup. Did you hear the latest rumor so to speak yeah, all right and and listen to this one

[01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:49.560]
Rimmers rumors here we go

[01:06:50.360 --> 01:06:55.620]
Uh if the shantahan deal goes through rumors rumors if between Detroit and

[01:06:55.620 --> 01:07:03.440]
Hartford yeah, Hartford will flip flop coffee back to the New York Rangers. Yeah, about each for covalogue for covalogue

[01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:07.000]
Yeah, we already heard that yeah too bad rumor. We already heard that like an hour ago anyway

[01:07:08.020 --> 01:07:13.280]
Well, I didn't know who started the rumor don't you stand fish laran a devil game last night. Oh really?

[01:07:13.340 --> 01:07:15.880]
Yeah, he's he's another potty model. I thought they'd copy started

[01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:17.940]
Because no stand fishler started it, you know

[01:07:17.940 --> 01:07:22.300]
He's the same guy that said that we aren't going anywhere. He don't know nothing about anything. There you go

[01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:25.780]
No more need be said. I'm sure it was sure nicely in the flyers

[01:07:25.780 --> 01:07:31.920]
Beat last night beat New Jersey because now they both lost the game. They're both like one and one and we like that

[01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:36.480]
But there's Neil understand one thing. I think it's great that the Panthers don't get the respect from

[01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:40.520]
The national media that they should and we didn't last year and you know something

[01:07:40.520 --> 01:07:43.500]
Nobody here cares about that. We don't care about the national media

[01:07:43.500 --> 01:07:46.960]
We don't care about the magazines about all these picks all we do is you know

[01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:51.020]
Care about going out there and seeing them play great every night and winning the games exactly. We know how good they are

[01:07:51.020 --> 01:07:55.240]
Exactly, exactly, but I can tell you that the hockey teams you talk to the coaches you talk to the players

[01:07:55.240 --> 01:07:59.780]
They'll tell you how much respect they've got for the Panthers. They're not taking them lightly and that's more important

[01:07:59.780 --> 01:08:04.920]
Quite frankly. Yep. I envision tonight not only is gonna be a great night with all these ceremonies and the

[01:08:04.920 --> 01:08:08.000]
festivities but boy I just envision a real

[01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:15.020]
Nasty. It's gonna be rough. It's gonna be a tough game. The lights go out at 710. They want everybody in their seats

[01:08:15.720 --> 01:08:16.860]
And quiet I might add

[01:08:16.860 --> 01:08:26.500]
Our messier is lights gonna go out and old Samuelson made probably about 745. I said I want everybody quiet in the roger section tonight

[01:08:26.500 --> 01:08:34.040]
Watching the game. Yeah, you especially have a vested interest in that having since you worked so feverishly to get me those great seats in those great tickets

[01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:39.440]
You're certainly responsible for the behavior of all those people in 106 tonight as usual. I'll take the blame

[01:08:39.440 --> 01:08:40.820]
Okay, no problem now

[01:08:40.820 --> 01:08:43.800]
I want you to tell your good friend Dean Jordan a little thing about public relations

[01:08:44.220 --> 01:08:47.840]
I'm sure you must have read his comments about the game being on 33 tonight actually

[01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:50.200]
I talked to Dean about it last night and he said well

[01:08:50.200 --> 01:08:53.320]
It was always gonna be on air. We didn't do it because of the tci thing

[01:08:53.320 --> 01:08:56.920]
We didn't do it to try to please anybody see even if they didn't do it

[01:08:56.920 --> 01:09:00.360]
You do the smart thing like our friend rich from a sports channel said yesterday

[01:09:00.360 --> 01:09:02.400]
And you know you kind of like

[01:09:03.060 --> 01:09:09.240]
Gildolulu a little bit you say well see how nice we are we're paying the money which they are to put it on 33 so everybody can see it and

[01:09:09.240 --> 01:09:15.580]
You don't have to deny you don't have to confirm or deny it. No, don't take it out of context the point that the dean's making is hey

[01:09:15.580 --> 01:09:16.520]
This is great

[01:09:17.060 --> 01:09:21.040]
Well, not great, but and I'll put it out here. It's a bonus. It's a bonus that

[01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:26.760]
In fact the tci subscribers are going to see it, but Dean's point is this there are a lot of people in self-floor it

[01:09:26.760 --> 01:09:32.760]
That don't have cable right all right, so the idea right what if they don't have you hf exactly but

[01:09:34.680 --> 01:09:37.160]
Understand one thing yeah the panthers

[01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:42.180]
Right from the onset they wanted to make sure that everybody in self-floor to had a chance

[01:09:42.180 --> 01:09:49.340]
So way back before this tci thing ever became the issue that it that it was the panthers always had in their mind that they were going to make the game

[01:09:49.340 --> 01:09:54.740]
Available to everyone in self-floor to and that's the point that he was making. Thank you Dean

Feded teams in league beside the Panthers in the Leafs. So I guess I got pretty good taste

[01:14:28.740 --> 01:14:32.980]
He was looking a lot better. I looked the same just a little great. You do look very much the same your fail

[01:15:29.620 --> 01:15:33.820]
Have you ever been in movies with him? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, but I might

[01:15:33.820 --> 01:15:37.180]
Somebody just talk. There's probably no cash left over after he's in it

[01:15:37.180 --> 01:15:42.880]
For anybody else, you gotta do you know, you gotta do it for the love of art. Yeah, or the love of sly or something

[01:15:43.880 --> 01:15:45.900]
Um, yeah, actually they talk to me

[01:15:45.900 --> 01:15:51.560]
They're talking to me this week about doing a film that he's doing a cameo in and his brother starring in

[01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:57.120]
Brother Frank. Oh great. How about his mother? She gonna be in there too. She's just doing the you know

[01:15:57.120 --> 01:16:00.260]
The hero of the nail lady. Whatever the hell she does the horoscope. Yeah, the horoscope

[01:16:00.260 --> 01:16:03.580]
So now what which dolphin player we're gonna get in there? You better make sure

[01:16:04.940 --> 01:16:06.600]

[01:16:10.620 --> 01:16:13.300]
I know what the other half is, but I'm not gonna sit on the air

[01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:18.080]
Yeah, no Lewis is not what you think. Yeah, he's gonna be an actor

[01:16:18.720 --> 01:16:23.280]
He's good. You know, it's interesting that he should be an actor because I think that fits right in with the ambiance of Louise

[01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:27.180]
I think that's a perfect. What are you laughing about? What does that mean?

[01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:29.120]
Next to be making Troy Ackman jokes

[01:16:29.580 --> 01:16:35.900]
What? Tragman's my hero. I want you to know by the way and my dad said something that wasn't nice at all last week

[01:16:35.900 --> 01:16:40.420]
Yeah, he said that there was a book written and they said some night and not nice things about Troy's my idol

[01:16:40.420 --> 01:16:46.440]
In fact, what do you mean some not nice things about him? Well, he said that Troy was single and he's a bachelor in your bag

[01:16:46.440 --> 01:16:52.960]
Well, so why is that not nice? Well, I mean, there's no no no no. It's just the point the point being do you think he is a bag?

[01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:55.400]
I think it's his business

[01:16:59.380 --> 01:17:03.520]
Yeah, nobody's business. He's not like yeah, I think so. Yeah, what about Steve Young?

[01:17:04.280 --> 01:17:07.580]
Steve Young what are they two of them have in common Steve Young and Trey Ackman?

[01:17:08.060 --> 01:17:11.080]
Are they both single? They both they're both single. They both were number eight

[01:17:11.080 --> 01:17:15.740]
They're both much too old. They've never been married really. I thought Steve Young had a bunch of kids

[01:17:16.300 --> 01:17:20.460]
He's a Mormon, isn't he? Well, he's the Mormons. He's riding the bicycle real hard

[01:17:20.460 --> 01:17:23.040]
But the kids ain't coming out yet. So it doesn't work that way

[01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:29.500]
Do Mormons have kids? I mean lots of lots and lots of kids just ask Donnie and Marie they don't dance though, right?

[01:17:29.500 --> 01:17:31.260]
They don't dance they don't have time for it

[01:17:31.260 --> 01:17:35.700]
Orman's dance and they wear those what do they call it again the the moon underwear the

[01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:38.320]
Sacred on underwear the sacred

[01:17:38.980 --> 01:17:40.840]
No, they were the sacred garments

[01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:44.900]
The only time they take them off is the shower temple garments

[01:17:44.900 --> 01:17:48.120]
Yes, and they got like a little hole a little finesse debris

[01:17:48.120 --> 01:17:54.140]
What are they doing in the locker room? I mean, they like have to wait till the other guys clear the shower

[01:17:54.140 --> 01:17:59.060]
Well, I know what Steve Young does in locker room, but that's none of your business personal like you said if then your business

[01:17:59.520 --> 01:18:01.440]
So which door for them we're gonna have Louise Oliver

[01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:05.780]
I think he's safe. I think his job is safe. He's playing pretty good. It's a good thing you were planning on Jean Vincent

[01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:07.660]
A gene gene

[01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:08.720]
Gene

Jean Bopalula boy you are getting old aren't you? Yeah, hold you inspire all these old memories in me

[01:18:15.100 --> 01:18:20.580]
Um, I'll tell you what nobody ever says I'm the only person that says anything about K. Pasa USA to you. Yeah, why?

[01:18:21.200 --> 01:18:26.960]
No, no actually love about every other week someone mentions K. Pasa USA someone says hey chill that's still on it

[01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:34.120]
So much today recognize me and they today they recognize me they said joe mama over at a raised place. Yeah, oh yeah

Are so who else are we gonna you gonna out on here today?

[01:18:48.640 --> 01:18:50.320]
Let me think let me think

[01:18:50.320 --> 01:18:56.480]
I did a film with which you're last year. That's nothing new and what did you what did you do? I got it

[01:18:56.480 --> 01:19:01.580]
Well, you know what what was amazing was that he was so he was just so he was so great first of all

[01:19:01.580 --> 01:19:06.460]
I was very afraid it was a refreshing experience because he was very very sweet. Why do you hollywood? He was sweet

[01:19:06.460 --> 01:19:09.660]
He was very sweet, but he I got the distinct

[01:19:09.660 --> 01:19:14.800]
He kept making work he kept squeezing my cheeks and saying look at that face

[01:19:16.060 --> 01:19:19.840]
And I was trying to look at that out. I couldn't understand what that meant. Yeah

[01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:22.480]
And then and then one night he called me in my room

[01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:28.840]
But I was with the I had a your 20 year old chick, you know, yeah, I had some other traveling companion with me

[01:19:28.840 --> 01:19:32.180]
But I get what does that mean traveling companion because you said before

[01:19:32.180 --> 01:19:37.440]
Well, the news was on you said your feminine side is starting to come out. It is I think that that's you know in the 90s

[01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:39.480]
part of my my

[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:41.000]
My imminent

Success that's coming coming around now again is

[01:19:46.300 --> 01:19:50.980]
Because of well the carry grant thing that we talked about I think Tony Perkins thing

[01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:57.460]
You know tab hunter is still around tab hunter getting pretty old, but he and Tony were an item. He still has to learn here. Yeah

It's real too. I'm sure you probably might out of Tony Perkins were still around, but he's not

[01:20:03.520 --> 01:20:07.980]

The movie starts to use to come down to Cuba

[01:21:21.380 --> 01:21:24.080]
So I think we got a real scoop here today the Cubans came

[01:21:24.520 --> 01:21:30.440]
Over here not to get away from Castro, but to get away from all the fags and then the way things turn around look at what happened on South Beach

[01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:37.580]

[01:24:29.800 --> 01:24:33.780]
But uh anybody who believes there's a god should come in here and look at this

[01:24:34.520 --> 01:24:39.740]
Compared to the day when you were walking around naked on a tv show with a towel around your waisted. How old are we on that show?

[01:24:40.100 --> 01:24:44.340]
18? I was 18 and it looked really good and now he's uh oh man

[01:24:45.120 --> 01:24:48.960]
I'm telling you you know the lady outside uh, she said she

[01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:52.420]
She gave me too bad you lost all that weight because you could have been a ranger me standing

[01:24:52.420 --> 01:24:55.600]
But I don't think you're double-jointed are you probably tried a few times

[01:24:56.180 --> 01:24:58.100]
Okay, let's do a break here and uh

[01:24:58.100 --> 01:25:01.640]
Steven the bower and chiever rea whatever's name is he's hanging out here because uh

[01:25:01.640 --> 01:25:04.780]
Raid just gave him a free lunch 12 15 at w-i-o-d heaven

[01:25:04.780 --> 01:25:06.640]
Talking entertainment radio

[01:25:07.640 --> 01:25:09.300]
610 w-i-o-d

[01:25:09.300 --> 01:25:15.100]
12 18 at w-i-o-d wouldn't you know that there'd be some big radio news on the day our final day at doing a show out of this studio

[01:25:15.680 --> 01:25:17.560]
And here's a little clue see you buddy

[01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:25.100]
It says the federal communications commission handed an eight thousand dollar fine to wv i cfm and east lancing

[01:25:25.100 --> 01:25:28.240]
Michigan for salty language on a morning talk show

[01:25:28.720 --> 01:25:30.800]
Now isn't that where he came from in the first place

[01:25:32.040 --> 01:25:36.540]
When the boy giri hid him i'm pretty sure that's where he came from and he's back at the scene of the crime again

[01:25:36.540 --> 01:25:43.460]
The penalty arose from comments made by on air collars during a june third show hosted by jaz mc

[01:25:43.460 --> 01:25:48.480]
See you buddy the collars used defensive words while discussing oral and anal sex

[01:25:48.480 --> 01:25:49.120]
Wow

[01:25:49.760 --> 01:25:54.740]
The FCC is banned by povats the first time a state has been criticized for indecency since 1994

[01:25:55.100 --> 01:25:56.040]
Wow, yeah

[01:25:56.800 --> 01:26:02.360]
So there you go. I think jaz is right up your alley see you buddy. So to speak here's a call from boca. Hello

[01:26:03.880 --> 01:26:04.680]
Boca hello

[01:26:05.440 --> 01:26:08.740]
Gone yeah, thanks for killing the show here rocky. It's great everybody

[01:26:08.740 --> 01:26:11.380]
We had a full board of calls and the bizarre part

[01:26:11.380 --> 01:26:17.140]
You know something i must have done something really evil in my life because rimmer was on air who usually blows out the whole board of calls

[01:26:17.140 --> 01:26:20.960]
Drop off every time he comes i heard him and they all stayed on there and i thought gee

[01:26:20.960 --> 01:26:26.460]
This is a breath of fresh air then Steven sits down here to shamelessly plug his movie and i'll read thank rave for the free lunch

[01:26:26.460 --> 01:26:29.060]
And everybody is dropping off here like flies

[01:26:29.580 --> 01:26:35.580]
So it's obvious that that's because nobody wants it and they don't want to know all the dirt that's obvious that they don't remember on your great

[01:26:36.240 --> 01:26:36.900]
Flicks like

Okay, there's only men are calling huh? I come only men are calling because we don't have any women listen to the show

No seriously. We don't do it like four or five women

[01:35:40.780 --> 01:35:47.800]
Predominantly male audience because most of the women in this audience don't know who you are. That must be it

Do the women call you rocky or just a man?

[01:36:09.780 --> 01:36:13.880]
That's just a man just a man because they think that you know, it's a more intimate thing and then that

[01:36:14.420 --> 01:36:18.480]

Congratulations, you're the only one I think

[01:40:07.300 --> 01:40:13.100]
I have a friend who's Cuban who turned me on to that show. Yeah, I had never watched it because I just

[01:40:13.100 --> 01:40:16.500]
assumed it was in Spanish when I saw it in the TV. That was in Spanglish

[01:40:16.500 --> 01:40:21.720]
Which mean like every other word was Engelschen every other word was a spikish. Yes, helped me learn quite a bit

[01:40:21.720 --> 01:40:24.960]
Did you? Yes, and what is it that you learned?

[01:40:25.860 --> 01:40:30.540]
Well, I don't want to repeat it. The Cubans are very repressed and uptight and the hypocrite critical about their sexual behaviors

[01:40:30.540 --> 01:40:33.460]
That what you learned I could have told you that my friend told me that as well

[01:40:34.180 --> 01:40:38.320]
George could have told you that in return. I turned him on to your show

[01:40:39.100 --> 01:40:41.540]
Neil yeah, and he really enjoys it all right

[01:40:41.540 --> 01:40:47.240]

Krazzy still is nash and yeah also. I'd like to

[01:40:50.600 --> 01:40:56.300]
We're not gonna find that helplessly. What do you mean if I could find it? Well, you used to play it a long time ago. Yeah

[01:40:57.540 --> 01:41:01.920]
Today's definitely the day to be asking for it. Yeah, that all our crap is over and out of the building today

[01:41:01.920 --> 01:41:04.720]
I know I do have a question for your guest

[01:41:05.440 --> 01:41:08.980]
Um, what do you mean by guest? He just well fell in here off the street

Improvise and funny. I mean he's he's not afraid. I thought he had a good sense of humor. I'd like to tell you what I'm fishing

[01:41:53.640 --> 01:41:59.080]
I'd like to see them maybe Dick Clark can do one of his bloopers on that or we're gonna one of those you get asked right Brian

[01:42:20.180 --> 01:42:20.620]
But

[01:42:21.740 --> 01:42:24.400]

Scenes that you're supposed to improvise is with the Christopher walking the taking your pants off and now you're

Improvising with some other guy. No, no, no, no, there were ladies

In fact, they were told that they were gonna be in a scene

[01:43:30.780 --> 01:43:35.160]
That they were gonna be a lot of it was gonna be nudity and they were gonna be in a scene with Al Pacino

[01:43:35.160 --> 01:43:40.480]
But what they didn't know is that Al Pacino won't do nude scenes. Yeah. Well who that would want to see that? Oh

Weston how you doing Kim? Good afternoon. Yes, sir

[01:44:48.480 --> 01:44:51.520]
Steven I have a question. I just curious how do you resolve

[01:44:52.340 --> 01:44:54.820]
Your Cuban and also this

[01:44:55.760 --> 01:45:00.160]
Dolcrap about the elitist Hollywood or the Hollywood elite

[01:45:00.800 --> 01:45:06.220]
As an actor never said he was a Republican. Well, I just curious say how or your family or your friends

[01:45:06.220 --> 01:45:11.660]
How do you resolve all that? Why do you feel about I resolved it in the episode five of k-possil you say

[01:45:11.760 --> 01:45:12.980]
See the tax on

[01:45:12.980 --> 01:45:19.600]
Not you do the body about all the attacks on the Republicans on the Hollywood. Yeah, it bothers me

[01:45:19.600 --> 01:45:22.240]
Yes, it does it bothers me because uh

[01:45:22.240 --> 01:45:29.060]
Because most of it is just it's ignorance really. I mean uh, you can't generalize you know about the Cuban community

[01:45:29.060 --> 01:45:29.880]
um

[01:45:30.840 --> 01:45:33.920]
You know, I mean there's there's all it takes all types, you know

[01:45:33.920 --> 01:45:41.040]
There's a lot of people making a lot of noise and making fools of themselves and then there's a lot of people who really know what they're talking about and have a lot of passion

[01:45:41.040 --> 01:45:45.920]
In other words what you say is not all old Cubans played dominoes and then not all the Hollywood is just

[01:45:45.920 --> 01:45:49.080]
These people that they keep tickling all the time. Yeah, exactly

[01:45:49.080 --> 01:45:54.680]
So how do you feel about the the growth of the movie industry in south Florida? You still think it's uh, I mean

[01:45:54.680 --> 01:46:01.020]
What kind of vibes you pick is happening? It's gonna happen and uh and a lot of people I was just out in in Los Angeles last week

[01:46:01.020 --> 01:46:06.460]
And uh a lot of my friends are moving here. They're all looking for for real estate here. They're all looking to

[01:47:04.240 --> 01:47:08.480]
Oh, it's your magic building and sunny left us a few bottles who are half full so we're in good shape

[01:47:10.460 --> 01:47:14.880]

Four Lauderdale. Yeah, Neil speak to me. Yes. Okay. Yeah, I just wanted to ask the question

[01:49:06.320 --> 01:49:09.760]
Working in Scarface with Al Pacino Steve

[01:49:11.140 --> 01:49:14.280]
I just I just been like his last movie with

[01:49:14.900 --> 01:49:19.640]
With Robert and Arrow was he like is loud as he was in that movie

[01:49:22.280 --> 01:49:24.660]
I don't know he seemed like he just was well

[01:49:24.660 --> 01:49:30.840]
Went kind of crazy with Robert and you and that movie they did I forgot what he it's called heat Michael man directly. Oh, yeah

[01:49:30.840 --> 01:49:36.700]
Yeah, I don't know I kind of liked it. I like what he did. I wanted to do that role though. I love that that screenplay

[01:49:36.700 --> 01:49:40.480]
Michael Manroll, but um, no, I mean now is you know he's

[01:49:40.940 --> 01:49:43.060]
You never know where he's gonna go

[01:49:44.220 --> 01:49:50.120]
Scarface, I mean he gets a vision of the character and of you know what the person's like and he just flies

[01:49:50.120 --> 01:49:55.680]
Oh, I think he did a I think he did a pretty good job being you know, you know, spat Cuban, I guess you know

[01:49:55.680 --> 01:50:00.540]
I thought that was a pretty good job. I oh yeah, I don't think uh, I mean I think the whole

[01:50:01.240 --> 01:50:06.900]
character and and I saw that one I was like, uh, I don't know as well as a while ago. I saw when it when it came out like

[01:50:07.740 --> 01:50:09.240]
And I was young and it was a

[01:50:09.240 --> 01:50:15.140]
See anyway scary movie. I thought I mean he was more credible as a Cuban than Robert and Arrow is as a Jew

[01:50:15.860 --> 01:50:17.600]
Oh, well, yeah, right

[01:50:18.700 --> 01:50:23.680]
Yeah, I don't true. It wants to run a time American. Yeah, not a good Jew noodles right

[01:50:24.300 --> 01:50:33.060]
All right, cool once upon a time. Yeah, I'm so good. Um, yeah, and then I just wonder like you know, uh, like if you uh if you like working with him

[01:50:33.060 --> 01:50:35.660]
I loved it. I love that every day was an adventure

[01:50:36.760 --> 01:50:39.800]
uh, he was like a big brother to me and uh

[01:50:40.220 --> 01:50:42.660]
It really took care of me was very very generous

[01:50:43.160 --> 01:50:49.540]
Contrary to what most people think uh, the big stars are like with young with young actors that being my first film

[01:50:50.020 --> 01:50:56.300]
And uh me being considerably taller than him. He never uh he never never upstage me now

[01:50:56.300 --> 01:51:01.500]
He always he always gave me the floor and gave me the you know, he he was great great great

[01:51:01.960 --> 01:51:04.160]
Yeah, how tall is he anyway?

[01:51:04.220 --> 01:51:04.820]
I'm three

[01:51:04.820 --> 01:51:05.960]
I'm tall enough

[01:51:06.680 --> 01:51:12.480]
Well, I mean because I I mean I it's so funny when you talk to my mom when you see some of the the movie stars and

[01:51:12.660 --> 01:51:16.960]
I mean I I remember going to a Panther game and I saw this limousine pull up and

[01:51:16.960 --> 01:51:21.340]
So Vets' to long came out and man, I mean he's not as tall as me. He's not tall at all

[01:51:21.340 --> 01:51:24.180]
Now we hear that he's not too big especially those who've seen that movie

[01:51:24.560 --> 01:51:27.860]
Yeah, you know, he's telling yeah, that's the one. Yeah

[01:51:28.220 --> 01:51:34.520]
Um, and is your real is that your real last name? I mean, it was that just a stage name. All right. We're gonna go over this one more time

[01:51:34.520 --> 01:51:34.860]
Okay

[01:51:35.940 --> 01:51:41.080]
When I was born in Cuba my name was a steve i'm a chevardia like my father like my grandfather

[01:51:41.080 --> 01:51:45.460]
That's what I wanted to hear I just in here when I came to Miami a steve i'm became steve and

[01:51:45.460 --> 01:51:48.600]
Because it's English and then and

[01:51:48.600 --> 01:51:55.780]
Rocky is the nickname my grandfather gave me because when I was born I was 11 pounds 12 ounces and they said I was gonna be the next Rocky Marciano

[01:51:55.780 --> 01:51:57.700]
God you could have been on jury springer

[01:51:58.920 --> 01:52:04.300]

[01:52:05.020 --> 01:52:05.820]
German Jew

[01:52:05.820 --> 01:52:11.400]
Which he came to have and and the third to keep that kind of name and my it was my dad's

[01:52:11.400 --> 01:52:18.280]
My dad's advice when I went to Hollywood. He said you know, I've been flying all over the world for 25 years and

[01:52:18.880 --> 01:52:22.000]
Nobody has ever been able to pronounce a chevardia

[01:52:22.540 --> 01:52:25.600]
And I doubt that they're going to pronounce it in Hollywood

[01:52:25.600 --> 01:52:27.980]
What about with the new the new cover?

[01:52:27.980 --> 01:52:28.520]

Did you ever think about doing a second or was it ever considered with anybody?

[01:54:04.340 --> 01:54:07.640]
Yes, we did consider it but we looked around and there were too many bodies

[01:54:07.640 --> 01:54:08.960]
Nobody left alive

[01:54:09.480 --> 01:54:13.660]
So it would have been called Elvira because that's the only character that lived

[01:54:14.160 --> 01:54:15.500]
Uh, yeah, man

[01:54:15.500 --> 01:54:18.640]
Everybody has always you know talked about doing a sequel

[01:58:18.400 --> 01:58:19.140]
Da

[01:58:19.140 --> 01:58:27.840]
If your penis falls off in a forest and there's no one there to hear it

[01:58:27.840 --> 01:58:30.000]
Doesn't make a sound

[01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:30.920]
Shumma

[01:58:33.620 --> 01:58:35.560]
So here it is 102

[01:58:39.140 --> 01:58:45.320]
At W I D is all things bus all good things all bad things all mediocre things all evil things

[01:58:45.320 --> 01:58:49.240]
They all must come to an end that's right Julia sooner or later

[01:58:49.760 --> 01:58:53.720]
By the way, Jeff DeForest just came in and brought me a beautiful t-shirt the Canada from the

[01:58:54.520 --> 01:58:56.180]
Readers cup up there at Woodbine

[01:58:57.160 --> 01:59:00.460]
Pretty impressive place up there. It's only about 400 miles out of town

[01:59:00.460 --> 01:59:03.080]
So if you take a capital cost you three four hundred bucks to get out there

[01:59:03.080 --> 01:59:04.720]
But it's a pretty impressive joint

[01:59:05.240 --> 01:59:10.280]
But anyway, it's our final hour. It's our big one to two hour the final day in these prestigious studios here

[01:59:10.280 --> 01:59:13.980]
These hallowed halls that have been graced by the greats and ear grates

[01:59:13.980 --> 01:59:17.560]
The Miss Criance the Miss Fitz the Joey Reynolds the Drew Michaels of the world

[01:59:18.420 --> 01:59:23.020]
And here we are and it's only fitting that after a Stephen Bauer and

[01:59:23.020 --> 01:59:27.060]
Jeff Rimmer that I sit here coming to the final hour and there's one lonely call

[01:59:27.740 --> 01:59:30.880]
On the board does this say at all does this tell everything that we need to know

[01:59:31.580 --> 01:59:37.160]
This is so appropriate man your final chance on these lines on these numbers and you know other than these two

[01:59:37.160 --> 01:59:39.680]
Ladies who called in were both like personal acquaintances

[01:59:39.680 --> 01:59:44.120]
No women calling in for Stephen Bauer who you would think that even at this point in time

[01:59:44.120 --> 01:59:49.360]
You think we'd have them lined up one right after the other so give me this below me about we got millions of women out there listening

[01:59:49.360 --> 01:59:53.660]
They don't know from Rocky H.A. Maria from Stephen Bauer. What do they know from what do they know?

[01:59:53.980 --> 01:59:55.680]
What is it that they know

[01:59:58.140 --> 02:00:00.580]
Maybe Ellen DeGeneres maybe that's what they know

[02:00:04.260 --> 02:00:07.840]
Your last chance boy your last chance to get out in the big hour

[02:00:09.120 --> 02:00:10.080]

Hey, I want to ask you a question. There you have Stephen on the line there. Who was that girl Maxine? That was his girlfriend

[02:04:59.040 --> 02:05:04.680]
That's the tennis lady. Oh the tennis lady. Yeah, because I was in another car. I mean she may be batting a few balls around

[02:05:04.680 --> 02:05:08.620]
But I don't think that uh Steven's connected with Maxine. Yeah

[02:05:09.200 --> 02:05:12.420]
Oh, well, I just like to say our congratulations getting out of the building and

[02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:17.460]
Hope you have a good life for the new building and back to you and I'll be listening to you. All right. Can I help you?

[02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:18.640]
What's that?

[02:05:21.120 --> 02:05:23.740]
Now here's the guy you know something you don't

[02:05:23.740 --> 02:05:28.040]
I've never heard him. My buddy's over here to tell me about it. I want to let me just ask you something

[02:05:28.040 --> 02:05:30.980]
If is anybody ever said to you that you have psychic abilities?

[02:05:31.400 --> 02:05:39.160]
Right, you're about to play? No, no, but the fact is that I had lost the disc. Okay, that it was on right and I for about a week

[02:05:39.160 --> 02:05:42.580]
It's been missing and I thought I wasn't going to be able to play it again until November 1st

[02:05:42.580 --> 02:05:48.360]
What are best of CD because it's on there and during the one o'clock news break or a commercial break

[02:05:48.360 --> 02:05:51.500]
I was digging through the copy file and what do you think I found?

[02:05:52.020 --> 02:05:57.360]
You just break sacred. How do you like that? So take two and call me in the morning. All right. Uh can I call some a douchebag? Yeah

[02:05:58.720 --> 02:05:59.100]
Oh

[02:06:02.040 --> 02:06:07.160]
You're just that's right Julio crazy you guys with how come this damn thing won't queue up now

[02:06:07.160 --> 02:06:11.060]
I got the disc in there. Oh, please don't tell me that there's been an evil spell put on this, huh?

[02:06:11.860 --> 02:06:18.640]
Oh my god, would that would that be something or what huh Jesus Christ for extra strength dexedron when you're getting crucified

[02:06:19.220 --> 02:06:20.940]
The last thing you need is a headache

[02:06:21.580 --> 02:06:26.380]
There's so much pressure hanging around with the whole world sins weighing on your shoulders

[02:06:26.980 --> 02:06:32.580]
Then some fucking gladiator sticks a spear in your side. Yeah, Jesus Christ that hurts

[02:06:33.580 --> 02:06:36.560]
So in this thorny crown feels like a vice around my head

[02:06:37.160 --> 02:06:38.880]
That's when I reach for dexedron

[02:06:39.620 --> 02:06:44.940]
Well, I uh, I don't reach for it. Hey anybody got any dexedron

[02:06:45.520 --> 02:06:48.120]
Hey, Judas could you throw a couple into my mouth?

[02:06:48.520 --> 02:06:52.840]
Come on. I'm the savior for Christ sake extra strength dexedron

[02:06:52.840 --> 02:06:57.760]
Because a headache is a heavy cross to bear that should be our worst thing to worry about Adam

[02:06:57.760 --> 02:06:59.460]
Adam was just giving me a little lesson in life here

[02:06:59.460 --> 02:07:03.960]
It's uh 10 after one we got 49 minutes and 38 seconds left in the building, but who's counting?

[02:07:05.240 --> 02:07:05.600]
And

[02:07:05.600 --> 02:07:09.040]
Quite frankly, uh, I thought it was gonna be a very emotional hour

[02:07:09.040 --> 02:07:10.940]
I thought it was gonna be like choked up here

[02:07:10.940 --> 02:07:15.080]
I thought I'd probably be gagging and unable to speak and you know something it's a piece of cake

[02:07:15.080 --> 02:07:17.340]
In fact, I'm starting to get a big smile on my push

[02:07:19.060 --> 02:07:21.220]
I'm starting to feel this enormous sense of relief

[02:07:22.280 --> 02:07:24.720]
So we will take the K off that marquee. Thank you

[02:07:27.740 --> 02:07:30.120]
And we'll send a wrong message back at you

[02:07:31.260 --> 02:07:36.540]

[02:07:44.800 --> 02:07:46.440]
You gotta get it on tape. Yeah

[02:07:47.120 --> 02:07:53.720]
Is that is that a bulletin or what? I know right anyway, uh, but you got it on tape for proof

[02:07:53.720 --> 02:07:57.100]
Uh, can I call someone to do his bag?

[02:07:59.400 --> 02:08:05.200]
We have an open line on the uh, in date 7519 463 two of them 751 WYOD

[02:08:05.820 --> 02:08:09.860]
It's a 12 after one at WYOD attack in entertainment radio

[02:08:11.780 --> 02:08:12.500]
16 WYOD

[02:08:13.480 --> 02:08:18.340]
Okay, 114 at WYOD we got one open line and Broward if you'd like to be part of our final hour from this building

[02:08:18.340 --> 02:08:24.360]
And like I said for the average listener out there for the average schmuck on a street for the average Joe who just kind of passing through life

[02:08:24.760 --> 02:08:28.140]
That's not a lot of significance because we're still going to be on the same spot on the dial

[02:08:28.140 --> 02:08:32.360]
We're still going to be doing the same crap. We're still going to be around and life goes on but

[02:08:32.820 --> 02:08:33.860]
We won't be here

[02:08:34.440 --> 02:08:38.180]
So while it doesn't mean much to you especially like if you're not familiar with this part of town

[02:08:38.180 --> 02:08:42.860]
If you're not familiar with the drive that some of us make to this joint every day except for Adam who lives across the street

[02:08:42.860 --> 02:08:44.200]
And it'll be good to get him out of the neighborhood

[02:08:44.200 --> 02:08:47.780]
Maybe you'll understand there's more to life than the 79th street causeway

[02:08:47.780 --> 02:08:49.720]
And the pill doctor

[02:08:50.800 --> 02:08:52.460]
Here's a mobile and curl spring. Hello

[02:08:53.060 --> 02:08:54.420]
Hey Neil how you doing great

[02:08:54.880 --> 02:09:00.580]
Good. I'm John round in the rain and just wanted to let you know light up with a stogie for that last hour

[02:09:01.940 --> 02:09:04.960]
Um, and also I just want to say I saw a hand class night

[02:09:05.800 --> 02:09:10.060]
The hammer yeah, and uh, is there any way you can get him on the atkins?

[02:09:10.760 --> 02:09:14.180]
He is looking big man. Yeah, he's on the scatkins right now. It's a matter of fact

[02:09:14.180 --> 02:09:20.260]
Okay, how come this thing ain't queuing up is there some special reason that the equipment is our last day and everything is our last day

[02:09:20.260 --> 02:09:26.780]
And we have a little bit of a problem. I did obviously the iode engineers the new ones are listening with great interest as they

[02:09:26.780 --> 02:09:29.260]
And probably amusement as

[02:09:29.260 --> 02:09:33.800]
Just we can't get through the last 44 minutes and 13 seconds. Not that I'm counting my jet

[02:09:33.800 --> 02:09:38.900]
I want you to get the idea that I'm like looking forward to this momentous occasion there. We go nice going

[02:09:38.900 --> 02:09:40.880]
Thank you so much Cox broadcasting

[02:09:41.620 --> 02:09:44.180]
Here's a lake worth hello, Neil. Yes, sir

[02:09:44.800 --> 02:09:47.660]
Congratulations on your last day. Thank you. I had a

[02:09:47.660 --> 02:09:51.760]
One night when I was driving home at two o'clock in the morning when they were playing you know rerun at night

[02:09:52.120 --> 02:09:55.080]
They had a bid on that I'd never heard played during the day

[02:09:55.660 --> 02:09:58.160]
And I figured probably because it was so obscene

[02:09:58.720 --> 02:09:59.780]
About Harry ball

[02:10:00.800 --> 02:10:05.240]
Yeah, that is that's not obscene. Well, I mean, I didn't have you ever played it during the day

[02:10:05.240 --> 02:10:09.240]
Yeah, what is the name of that thing? I know what you're talking it went on and on for a long time

[02:10:09.240 --> 02:10:13.420]
But it was hilarious. Yes, grow them. That's the name of that. That's not obscene. Oh, okay. Well

[02:10:14.440 --> 02:10:15.840]
In fact, I might just have

[02:10:16.420 --> 02:10:20.400]
Scroed them over here now that not's not in there like I said you're out of luck today

[02:10:20.400 --> 02:10:24.400]
But I have a feeling I know just where to find them. That was that was great. I know that during the day

[02:10:24.400 --> 02:10:24.960]
Absolutely

[02:10:25.500 --> 02:10:30.760]
In fact, I'm pretty sure that's on our best stuff for me their last year of the year before I would bet a lot of two or three dollars on it

[02:10:30.760 --> 02:10:31.400]
okay

[02:10:32.360 --> 02:10:34.520]
Well have fun in the new place and sorry

[02:10:34.520 --> 02:10:39.320]
You won't be able to trip over Sally Fitz's devices on your way out into parking lot bad. We's not included man

[02:10:39.320 --> 02:10:45.080]
And let me just close by saying Caesar and the entire world and my dad who now likes Ron and Ron better than you

[02:10:45.080 --> 02:10:50.420]
Is a douchebag your dad likes Ron and Ron better than me. I got a message for your dad

[02:10:50.420 --> 02:10:52.620]
I'd Sally Fitz would say

[02:10:53.240 --> 02:10:54.980]
Take it up your ass

[02:10:54.980 --> 02:10:56.180]
Have a great day pal

[02:10:56.720 --> 02:10:59.480]
Okay, we have an open line of brown art five. Oh, I'm giving that number out again

[02:10:59.480 --> 02:11:04.160]
I promised I wouldn't do that plus we don't want to confuse these people because we got brand new numbers starting tomorrow in our new building

[02:11:04.160 --> 02:11:05.100]
brand new numbers

[02:11:05.720 --> 02:11:06.640]
Which we don't know yet

[02:11:07.440 --> 02:11:13.220]
What we do know but we don't want to get over involved. Okay, see I think what it is you guys got this you just don't understand

[02:11:13.220 --> 02:11:18.980]
Some people did not participate in the move or have it at least to this point because they don't want to be in the way

[02:11:20.720 --> 02:11:29.240]
Isn't that a good that's a I think I just came up with a very good alibi for people have been at conspicuously absent and uninvolved in this gargantuan project the bars

[02:11:29.240 --> 02:11:33.540]
They don't want to get in the way because when you come right down to it. What are they going to contribute anyway?

[02:11:34.700 --> 02:11:35.900]
So stay out of the way

[02:11:36.960 --> 02:11:43.040]
Although being in a prone position, you know, unless you step it on somebody here's Miami Beach. Hello. I live and work down the street

[02:11:43.040 --> 02:11:48.740]
So it's understandable. Oh my god. I wish you goodbye. Oh, bro. See you see you another time

[02:11:50.900 --> 02:11:53.140]
Take it easy. Have a great life pal

[02:11:56.180 --> 02:11:58.400]
Didn't realize we had so many listos right here in the neighborhood

[02:11:58.400 --> 02:12:02.300]
Of course if they've only got an a-m radio they probably can't pick up any other signal on a dial

[02:12:02.840 --> 02:12:06.000]
We got a good captive audience within about a two-three block radius

[02:12:08.600 --> 02:12:11.400]
Which is my favorite toothbrush or one of my least favorite colors

[02:12:16.800 --> 02:12:17.980]
That's right Julio

[02:12:20.620 --> 02:12:25.080]
We left some great cards around here just for these closing shows make no mistake about that

[02:12:30.140 --> 02:12:33.780]
Especially that one where Rick snatches hovers over Sally and in the prone position

[02:12:35.560 --> 02:12:36.740]
Dressed up as a paramedic

[02:12:37.720 --> 02:12:39.260]
Was he just dressed up?

[02:12:40.620 --> 02:12:43.400]
A lot of stories by the way by how Rick snatches used to dress up

[02:12:43.400 --> 02:12:48.160]
But he used to do the early morning news on channel seven and I'm not joking about that. I mean really dress up

[02:12:48.160 --> 02:12:49.860]
But they're just stories

[02:12:50.580 --> 02:12:55.460]
Here's Kendall on the purple line. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. Neil. Yes, I am. Yes, sir

[02:12:55.460 --> 02:12:58.960]
I just wanted to say for those people that aren't familiar with Florida that sunny Florida

[02:12:58.960 --> 02:13:03.600]
Miss my ass. It's not actually happening. I'm driving through a tsunami. Oh

[02:13:03.600 --> 02:13:04.320]
My god

[02:13:05.440 --> 02:13:08.080]
When is this gonna end already ain't it the 8th of October?

[02:13:08.920 --> 02:13:09.360]
Boy

[02:13:11.100 --> 02:13:14.300]
Good no go already. Oh, I just want to pass on a major leak

[02:13:14.300 --> 02:13:16.540]
Jewish bag to my boss slash advisor

[02:13:17.860 --> 02:13:22.780]
John okay, thank you sir and have a great life. Okay, I went it down try it on

[02:13:24.420 --> 02:13:29.300]
So it's the end of the world again, and you know something it's fitting isn't it?

[02:13:29.420 --> 02:13:31.480]
It's appropriate that on this last day in the building

[02:13:31.480 --> 02:13:35.320]
We should have to drive home through like at the end of the world. That's the way you'd expect it to be

[02:13:36.140 --> 02:13:41.280]
I mean a nice bright sunny day would like a nary you know would like very little traffic

[02:13:41.280 --> 02:13:43.420]
That wouldn't be you'd never remember that

[02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:50.700]
But driving home with the dark dank real black clouds and with the claps of thunder and lightning and with the rain

[02:13:50.700 --> 02:13:55.060]
Just pouring down and with sitting water like two three feet. It's like coming to work this morning

[02:13:55.060 --> 02:13:57.320]
There were two traffic lights out on 119th

[02:13:57.320 --> 02:13:59.800]
Or whatever the hellster 135

[02:13:59.800 --> 02:14:05.560]
Or third or two whatever was two traffic lights out and congratulations to the fhp

[02:14:05.560 --> 02:14:09.340]
Maybe they finally did something good. They were directing it nice going guys

[02:14:10.620 --> 02:14:11.840]
Here's Tamarack hello

[02:14:14.080 --> 02:14:19.980]
Tamarack Neil yes, sir. Oh, yeah, I just wanted to know. I don't know if anybody asked the question. I doubted

[02:14:20.800 --> 02:14:25.860]
Tonight are they also going to broadcast the banner being raised on TV?

[02:14:26.900 --> 02:14:33.640]
Oh, I would think so because I think well, I don't know about that because I'm you know sports channel Florida has the pregame

[02:14:34.060 --> 02:14:36.880]
What time channel 33 starts with a thing? I don't know

[02:14:36.880 --> 02:14:41.860]
Well, it's looking in the TV got it. What time what does it say? It's a 730 for 33

[02:14:42.400 --> 02:14:45.600]
Yeah, but the channel the sports and you have sports channel Florida

[02:14:45.600 --> 02:14:49.980]
I hope well, I that would be the one I watch because I would be almost betting money at seven o'clock

[02:14:49.980 --> 02:14:53.540]
They'll have a pregame thing on here. Well, I hope so of course. I didn't get tickets

[02:14:54.100 --> 02:14:58.540]
Right because everybody wants to see that yeah, I mean, I think it would be great

[02:14:58.540 --> 02:15:04.380]
Is it all type of VCR going in everything right places gonna go nuts? All right, Neil. Thanks anyway. Okay

[02:15:04.380 --> 02:15:06.540]
Yeah, we'll find out about that for you somebody

[02:15:06.540 --> 02:15:11.000]
You'll call let us know what time that sports channel Florida thing which I'm praying and I'm sure I'm positive

[02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:15.340]
That Ned Smith will show his ugly post on air at around seven o'clock. We got all the festivities on here

[02:15:15.340 --> 02:15:20.280]
I hope of course we will or not two open lines and Broward of course and two on the green lines

[02:15:20.280 --> 02:15:23.700]
And now I understand we got the end of the world out there on the outside. That's no excuse

[02:15:23.700 --> 02:15:28.840]
Just because you're gonna get electrocuted when you pick up the phone. Hey, does that does that show me that you really care a lot

[02:15:30.460 --> 02:15:34.640]
Here's hi Alia. Hello, Neil man. That's exactly what happened to me man. I was on my cordless

[02:15:34.640 --> 02:15:38.280]
I was already on hold for like 20 minutes and boom out wow

[02:15:38.280 --> 02:15:42.120]
So listen Fettici out his man on your last hour last show man

[02:15:43.120 --> 02:15:48.200]
Listen dude, it does look like the end of the world out here in hi lia man. Yeah, I mean it is like totally flooded

[02:15:48.200 --> 02:15:52.720]
I would I would choke a chicken and just to be sure. I'm telling you man just to be on the safe side man

[02:15:52.720 --> 02:15:57.600]
Hi lia has no runoff man the water is like almost to the door man. Yeah, it's crazy man

[02:15:58.120 --> 02:16:02.120]
All right, Neil man. I do it every time and closing man, especially since this is your last show

[02:16:03.860 --> 02:16:04.640]
See a man

[02:16:05.820 --> 02:16:06.220]
Mean

[02:16:06.900 --> 02:16:08.240]
We have an open line in day

[02:16:08.240 --> 02:16:15.440]
It's 7519 463. I did give the number out because I feel compelled to do it since we have like 38 minutes and the 37 minutes and 33 seconds

[02:16:15.440 --> 02:16:21.620]
Not that I'm counting but and I feel that at this stage of the game and this at this point in my life in this point in the show

[02:16:21.620 --> 02:16:25.460]
It's totally inappropriate that we should be giving any numbers out that we should have any open lines

[02:16:25.460 --> 02:16:27.160]
I think it's probably in a front to me

[02:16:27.160 --> 02:16:30.480]
It's a personal slap and the post but I'm very much used to it and who cares

[02:16:31.260 --> 02:16:35.700]
Because the checks do come on time from our friends up the street and that's all we care about

[02:16:36.540 --> 02:16:42.160]
Here's the lady in Miami Springs. Hello. Hi Neil. How are you doing? Great. I'm calling to ask the stupid question

[02:16:42.760 --> 02:16:45.100]
Are you getting help panties tickets for tonight's game?

[02:16:45.640 --> 02:16:51.080]
We have two open lines in day 7519 463 751 W I O D

[02:16:51.080 --> 02:16:54.040]
We have two on the green lines one eight hundred nine four four

[02:16:54.040 --> 02:16:58.600]
We'll talk a little louder for you people up there in Palm Beach. What's the 54 59

[02:16:59.440 --> 02:17:02.220]
The weather channel. I think it's the 59 on this system here

[02:17:02.220 --> 02:17:08.660]
We are gonna miss we thank our friends at Gold Coast cable. We thank our close personal friend Gabe Baptiste of

[02:17:09.420 --> 02:17:12.480]
MTV Latino and his very good-looking brother

[02:17:12.480 --> 02:17:16.740]
We thank them profusely providing us with a tremendous amount of entertainment on his channel

[02:17:16.740 --> 02:17:21.200]
It almost nobody else gets on her cable, but trust me when I tell you they've got the good videos on air baby

[02:17:21.200 --> 02:17:26.340]
Individual storms within the line. We're uh, oh my god racing north look at it. Look at this

[02:17:26.340 --> 02:17:30.140]
We got a red thing at the bottom of the screen 30 to 40 miles an hour out there

[02:17:30.140 --> 02:17:34.300]
It's the end of the world and like I said early in the show when I went through a little monologue

[02:17:36.060 --> 02:17:38.180]
Here we sit at this cloistered studio

[02:17:39.080 --> 02:17:42.900]
No windows to the outside world totally out of touch with reality

[02:17:44.320 --> 02:17:48.880]
Boy, this is a damaging winds and excess of 55 miles an hour

[02:17:49.380 --> 02:17:53.680]
Very very heavy rain and deadly lightning it says

[02:17:54.500 --> 02:17:56.060]
Are all possible?

[02:17:56.380 --> 02:17:59.300]
Possibly is what it says with these storms

[02:18:00.040 --> 02:18:04.180]
Seek shelter give me shelters what it says in a strong building

[02:18:04.740 --> 02:18:08.420]
Like that building over there on the 79th street cause where we understand they got a lot of empty room now

[02:18:08.420 --> 02:18:13.360]
Stay away from windows which we don't have the windows in here. Thank the Lord do not use phones do not

[02:18:13.880 --> 02:18:20.360]
Use electrical appliances do not eat grapes do not eat potatoes do not eat pizza do not eat cookies

[02:18:26.180 --> 02:18:30.580]
Remember how you picked that one grape off the bunch the fruit was sitting in the thing and she's reading the list in

[02:18:30.580 --> 02:18:35.420]
The fan so of all the things you can't eat and just as he's about to pop the one little grape do not eat grapes

[02:18:35.960 --> 02:18:38.740]
And Dom Deleway's looks at it with that sorrowful look and

[02:18:41.080 --> 02:18:42.720]
You know where he puts it

[02:18:45.260 --> 02:18:50.780]
So the world is coming to an end out there bullet and immediate broadcast see now that we don't like we have a real

[02:18:50.780 --> 02:18:54.420]
I mean with all the respect to one who does a great job. He's a super guy does you know

[02:18:54.420 --> 02:18:58.080]
But we basically are like in a goldfish ball looking on the outside

[02:18:58.780 --> 02:19:03.560]
We don't like not really on top of these things because we feel that most people listening to this station are morons

[02:19:03.560 --> 02:19:05.760]
Anyway, and they don't care if the world's coming to win end

[02:19:05.760 --> 02:19:14.640]
They're too interested in humor and farting sounds in occasional belcher to in buttload and um a maha bone and back at you and douchebag and

[02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:19.440]
Barber buoy and important fashion plates like that

[02:19:20.220 --> 02:19:25.880]
As opposed to crap like is the world coming to win end when we have a horrendous storm are the roads all backed up and things like that

[02:19:25.880 --> 02:19:26.720]
We don't care about that

[02:19:28.080 --> 02:19:33.260]

Well, we're giving him that I mean that was the next edition game

[02:19:56.800 --> 02:19:58.560]
We're gonna give him a cut him a little slack on that

[02:19:58.560 --> 02:20:00.600]
But tonight's the real thing and we'll see how these people

[02:20:01.020 --> 02:20:05.600]
We'll see what the ambiances tonight. Okay. Well come down. Can you hear the couple of intermissions?

[02:20:05.720 --> 02:20:07.960]
We're gonna get there early get in my ass in the seat and

[02:20:08.720 --> 02:20:12.900]
Watch this opening ceremony. Well bring your ass on down. I will okay. Scott. All right

[02:20:13.980 --> 02:20:19.000]
Thank you. All right that's got our lawn man who comes by the house like once every not often enough

[02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:20.520]
I'll tell you that there's a fine young man

[02:20:21.060 --> 02:20:23.620]
There's a fine man if everybody in the world could be just like him

[02:20:23.620 --> 02:20:25.940]
I mean exactly like him. Maybe with a little less facial hair

[02:20:25.940 --> 02:20:29.280]
This would be a hell of a world to live in. I'll tell you that suds Coleman's in the building

[02:20:29.280 --> 02:20:32.940]
He's very emotional about this final day's doing an Indian rain dance and obviously it's working

[02:20:34.440 --> 02:20:39.200]
Everybody is really pumped up around here. That is everybody who's leaving those who are not gonna be leaving

[02:20:39.200 --> 02:20:43.560]
Of course, they're walking around with a long said push no more free food dammit

[02:20:45.500 --> 02:20:49.560]
That's right. There probably some people downstairs who're gonna be missing all those free fun fact

[02:20:49.560 --> 02:20:53.040]
I wouldn't be surprised I hate to say this because we love Wendy Bennett next door at the coast

[02:20:53.040 --> 02:20:56.020]
I wouldn't be surprised if they have to start feeding her intrepid

[02:20:56.020 --> 02:20:56.700]
Venusly

[02:20:56.700 --> 02:21:00.700]
Very very soon because we're I've been keeping her alive for like eight years now

[02:21:01.880 --> 02:21:07.620]
Just a little chicken soup here in there a little piece of a meal over here a little snack of a piece of meal over here

[02:21:07.620 --> 02:21:08.280]
and that's it

[02:21:09.100 --> 02:21:14.880]
And that's the only thing that's kept one to go and especially now during these really depressing days when she has to follow jade

[02:21:15.600 --> 02:21:20.480]
And spend most of her spare time making up all those derogatory pictures and the sayings and writing all those

[02:21:20.480 --> 02:21:25.760]
Which she loves doing by the way in fact she said that's the only thing that's gonna keep her don't go and is ragged on jade

[02:21:25.760 --> 02:21:27.500]
Dolan's ass 24 hours a day

[02:21:28.340 --> 02:21:29.760]
Nice go on Wendy. We love you

[02:21:31.100 --> 02:21:32.720]

Min radio 610 w.y.o.d

[02:21:45.540 --> 02:21:50.660]
When this quarter back it's lonely

[02:21:52.800 --> 02:21:55.520]
He likes receivers that are why

[02:21:56.720 --> 02:21:57.200]
Okay

[02:21:57.920 --> 02:22:01.700]
Some people say that number eight is gay

[02:22:02.720 --> 02:22:05.440]
They say Troy loves the big brown eye

[02:22:07.660 --> 02:22:08.500]
Ackman

[02:22:08.500 --> 02:22:13.260]
He goes down on his knees and he's a man

[02:22:15.120 --> 02:22:17.920]
It's guys he likes to please ackman

[02:22:18.700 --> 02:22:23.200]
He loves to slap cowboys on there behind

[02:22:25.920 --> 02:22:26.860]
You jacked out

[02:22:28.400 --> 02:22:31.140]
He's got a spotless reputation

[02:22:33.640 --> 02:22:36.120]
America's team is world renowned

[02:22:38.640 --> 02:22:40.020]
But is Troy gay

[02:22:40.640 --> 02:22:42.640]
I've heard some people say

[02:22:43.500 --> 02:22:48.640]
In the heart will he goes down ackman

[02:22:49.340 --> 02:22:53.600]
He goes down on his knees ackman

[02:22:55.220 --> 02:22:58.980]
I can't some balls to squeeze ackman

[02:23:00.620 --> 02:23:06.520]
Don't clip him cause he likes it from behind

[02:23:07.280 --> 02:23:12.380]
Lot 34 w.y.o.d on his momentous day of our daughter's wedding on his Tuesday man

[02:23:12.380 --> 02:23:15.880]
We're the world and I think the cleansing rains I think once we get moved in the studio

[02:23:15.880 --> 02:23:18.880]
I'm not I'm no meteorologist. I'm no Bob Lee for the weather man. I'm no

[02:23:19.400 --> 02:23:25.000]
Forecaster, but but I think that all of this has been like the heavens washing away

[02:23:25.440 --> 02:23:31.160]
The sins of the cocks people and paving the way for a new beginning and a new life and a new era and a new

[02:23:31.700 --> 02:23:33.880]
Sounds good, don't I don't believe it, but it sounds pretty good

[02:23:34.700 --> 02:23:36.120]
Here's a pember pines hello

[02:23:36.840 --> 02:23:38.780]
Hello me yes, yes

[02:23:38.780 --> 02:23:40.420]
Hey, listen um two questions. Oh, man

[02:23:40.420 --> 02:23:43.980]
If you could see the green thing on a weather map right now that I'm looking at oh god

[02:23:43.980 --> 02:23:49.220]
I thought it was red or pink. There's a it's yellow and red and pink and purple and the green and the weather map too

[02:23:49.220 --> 02:23:51.360]
Yeah, well, I think it's appropriate for you last day. Yeah

[02:23:51.360 --> 02:23:55.340]
Listen two questions I have seriously talked about radio I need your expertise for a second. Yes

[02:23:55.340 --> 02:24:01.780]
A couple of months ago asked George on your worldwide web page that you guys don't have the audio thing hook up

[02:24:01.780 --> 02:24:07.200]
Where if you're anywhere in the country? I don't know if George members in real audio you mean yeah real audio right

[02:24:07.780 --> 02:24:13.000]
In your new studio. There's a packs and have that thing hooked up yet George what's the story?

[02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:15.820]
I know George is hacking a chat with is the real audio thing that'll be hooked up

[02:24:15.820 --> 02:24:20.480]
Immediately if not sooner or what with the packs and people on the web real audio

[02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:22.780]
I think you know

[02:24:23.220 --> 02:24:27.120]
What i'm talking about. No, he's not a question for our program director. Oh, oh, I see

[02:24:27.740 --> 02:24:32.660]
Well, okay, well, since it's our program director makes his presence known or whereabouts or

[02:24:32.660 --> 02:24:36.460]
You know me a few months ago that cost us to keep to do that. I just

[02:24:36.460 --> 02:24:41.720]
Well, let me tell you this if if cost is the you know a determining factor. Yeah

[02:24:41.720 --> 02:24:46.040]
I guarantee you it'll be on there because the packs and people are sparing no expense super

[02:24:46.040 --> 02:24:49.440]
You know if you can pass along I mean, I mean then you can be anywhere in the country live for you

[02:24:49.440 --> 02:24:54.180]
Well, see that's the that's the whole idea of being on the web if you're in a radio biz because then people get to sample

[02:24:54.180 --> 02:24:59.220]
And then you put your call in numbers on there and then you get cost from people all over the world and it becomes a lot of fun

[02:24:59.220 --> 02:25:03.700]
It it means something other than just having a bunch of stupid stuff on there. Well, I mean now in that

[02:25:03.700 --> 02:25:07.160]
But I mean if you can't get if you're not simulcast another radio market

[02:25:07.160 --> 02:25:11.780]
You know people who live here at move somewhere else can't at least hear you over the internet that'll be nice also

[02:25:11.780 --> 02:25:16.340]
Excellent point listen now one more thing before I go don't you think it's appropriate for these jerk offs out

[02:25:16.340 --> 02:25:18.140]
They're listening to go screenless rest of the hour

[02:25:18.840 --> 02:25:21.840]
Yes do it neo do it okay good luck buddy see ya

[02:25:22.460 --> 02:25:25.000]
Okay, now he says that of course we have all the other lines lit at the moment

[02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:27.860]
So I guess he probably knew that most everybody is psychic at the moment

[02:25:27.860 --> 02:25:30.200]
We all have these very good sidekick vibrations

[02:25:30.980 --> 02:25:34.400]
And we do have an open line of pride so let him ring okay the rest of the air will just pick them up

[02:25:34.400 --> 02:25:37.320]
Of course we might not get to any of them, but that's okay take your chances all right

[02:25:37.320 --> 02:25:40.240]
And of course if you're lucky it's like Russian roulette if you're lucky

[02:25:40.240 --> 02:25:42.080]
I won't pick it up and then you won't get electrocuted

[02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:47.020]
No, I'm not the ball player oh

[02:25:48.680 --> 02:25:50.880]
God what a letdown yeah

[02:25:50.880 --> 02:25:56.720]
Well, I'm sure that don't take it well don't take it personally what I mean you can imagine my excitement when I look on the thing there and it says

[02:25:56.720 --> 02:26:01.040]
Alex Rodriguez and it turns out to be this Alex

[02:26:01.040 --> 02:26:05.020]
Yeah, but we'll settle for for you hey close but no cigars, huh right

[02:26:05.560 --> 02:26:09.240]
There's our field to never never ever have to drive

[02:26:10.500 --> 02:26:15.380]
That's 79th street again. Oh here's our walking peanut. I mean here's the Alex the board up

[02:26:15.960 --> 02:26:21.180]
You could still say that now or do you get a way to say you can say walking paint? I can say walking peanut

[02:26:21.180 --> 02:26:26.560]
Why didn't I literally say it anyway? I know that it was some stupid caller. They just didn't like you that's all

[02:26:26.560 --> 02:26:29.400]
I just I think that was a lot of fun here already

[02:26:29.400 --> 02:26:33.020]
So how are you doing now? I'm doing great Alex. How are you?

[02:26:33.060 --> 02:26:40.320]
Yes, sir we got 22 minutes and 40 seconds that that I'm counting I got what I said we've got 22 minutes and 36 seconds

[02:26:40.320 --> 02:26:44.060]
That that I'm counting well hey, you know sounds like a long time to me

[02:26:44.440 --> 02:26:45.720]
That's right Julio

[02:26:46.780 --> 02:26:50.260]
So you had Rocky on there earlier huh? Yeah, we did have Rocky. He was pretty good

[02:26:50.260 --> 02:26:54.040]
He is one hell of an actor man. He's a good guy. He is a good guy. He always comes up and gives me a good hug

[02:26:54.040 --> 02:26:58.200]
I get a little feel area. You know, it's a very emotional thing when we get together. I love him. He's a good guy

[02:26:58.200 --> 02:27:03.460]
I'm sure I'm sure it is I'm sure I would have known him about 15 20 years ago. Oh god

[02:27:03.460 --> 02:27:09.560]
So you wouldn't have to wait so long for his new experiences right right yeah, but anyway

[02:27:09.560 --> 02:27:13.520]
You're gonna be working across the street from my girlfriend. Yeah right across the street from

[02:27:14.060 --> 02:27:19.240]
Atlas Pen and pencil and so she can send us a bunch of free pens and crap that could be good

[02:27:19.240 --> 02:27:21.800]
But George is gonna try to hit on her. So I'm not too

[02:27:22.340 --> 02:27:25.300]
Happy about that. Yeah, he kind of likes her

[02:27:25.820 --> 02:27:29.420]
Well listen, I wouldn't be disappointed. He's got a long list. You know, he's got plenty of uh

[02:27:29.420 --> 02:27:33.340]
Of course, Anna Marie is gonna be stuck here in the building. So I guess that's one less. She'll have to worry about right

[02:27:33.340 --> 02:27:37.140]
So you know she doesn't make house calls. He's got room for another one. Right. Oh man

[02:27:37.560 --> 02:27:39.280]
And of course Miriam is gonna be going with us

[02:27:39.280 --> 02:27:40.300]
He's gonna be the trim lady

[02:27:40.300 --> 02:27:42.360]
I'm sure we'll follow us around and he where we go now

[02:27:42.360 --> 02:27:46.440]
That's gonna be a little problem George. You don't think that Roy's gonna get upset if I get a haircut in that studio

[02:27:46.440 --> 02:27:48.000]
Do you oh man?

[02:27:48.660 --> 02:27:51.020]

Oh, they don't uh, they're you know how these engineers are they're very nervous when they put something brand new together like that

[02:27:56.360 --> 02:28:01.340]
Like all of us slabs are gonna slab her all over in there. Hey, does Mitch ween still freak out about the readings?

[02:28:02.580 --> 02:28:02.980]
Yes

[02:28:04.480 --> 02:28:09.480]
Oh, I got another call buddy. Okay, Alex. I love your show, but I have a great life now. We'll see you soon

[02:28:43.280 --> 02:28:48.380]
You'll have it wired right. All right. Hey, remember that smelly bitch that called yesterday. Yeah, you know you should have called her

I'll look at the sand as you're looking at uh or raining cats and dogs up there in New York and New York

[02:30:01.580 --> 02:30:03.220]
That's good because we're not interested anyway

[02:30:21.620 --> 02:30:26.680]
Yeah, oh, I'm looking at this weather map. I mean the timing couldn't be better

[02:30:26.680 --> 02:30:30.060]
Okay, just in time for my drive up the Hershey highway

[02:30:30.060 --> 02:30:35.400]
This green and yellow mung is covered all a daydbroward in Palm Beach and into the keys

[02:32:01.080 --> 02:32:07.160]
I just hope we keep our cool including Eddie come on Eddie just calm does tone it down just a little bit Eddie just get a grip baby

[02:32:08.440 --> 02:32:12.920]
But we'll be all right. We'll you know see one thing about this team that that's why the Panthers are a lot like me

[02:32:12.920 --> 02:32:14.940]
Okay, they don't take any crap from anybody

[02:32:14.940 --> 02:32:17.640]
That's my philosophy in life and that's their philosophy too

[02:32:17.640 --> 02:32:21.520]
In fact, I told Doug McLean when they named him head coach. I said you just follow me pal

[02:32:22.080 --> 02:32:28.800]

It's the Ellen DeGeneres out of the closet organizer. Yeah, I think I heard about that who hasn't

[02:32:58.340 --> 02:33:03.500]
Let's face it when you're trying to keep everything including your sexual preferences in the closet

[02:33:03.500 --> 02:33:10.200]
It can make things messy. Well, I'll say and no matter whether you're looking for extra space for your hers and hers towels

Running out of room for all your Melissa Etheridge and Katie Lang CDs or trying to organize your collection of books

[02:33:16.360 --> 02:33:24.040]
Which way the Ellen DeGeneres out of the closet organizer is the best way to keep your hang up straight until you're ready to go out and public with them

[02:33:24.040 --> 02:33:30.900]
That sounds great and the Ellen DeGeneres out of the closet organizer is easy to assemble all you need is some strap on hardware

[02:38:24.220 --> 02:38:25.040]
W.I.O.D

[02:38:25.040 --> 02:38:31.940]
On the other side is Joey Witchner's brother and I just want to say God created all what there is

[02:38:31.940 --> 02:38:32.560]
Haha

[02:38:33.260 --> 02:38:34.200]
All right

[02:38:35.120 --> 02:38:39.380]
He's still around man. They shot him 85 times and he's still alive

[02:38:39.380 --> 02:38:43.440]
W.I.O.D. and God said let there be a lightning round right

[02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:47.020]
Uh, I guess and here it is W.I.O.D.

[02:38:47.220 --> 02:38:50.020]
Oh coward in Palm Beach coward

[02:38:50.720 --> 02:38:53.820]
W.I.O.D. Yeah, yeah only if

[02:38:53.820 --> 02:38:57.920]
Right excellent. Okay, of course to show you they got a good memory number one and number two

[02:38:57.920 --> 02:39:00.560]
We still got a few people around here for more than five minutes ago

[02:39:01.100 --> 02:39:06.420]
Sometimes you have your doubts about that like they all got laws like they all went on some kind of a mission somewhere like the

[02:39:06.420 --> 02:39:09.240]
All got religion or not as the case may be

[02:39:09.240 --> 02:39:15.680]
Hey, there's Phil Costin in there who was uh came into bid farewell to the building. He's kissing the walls. He's uh

[02:39:15.680 --> 02:39:17.980]
Right in graffiti everywhere he can find some room

[02:39:19.240 --> 02:39:21.220]
Just like Henry Barrow said earlier in the show

[02:39:21.220 --> 02:39:24.520]
He said there's the one man who's got more stories than anybody else. Do you want?

[02:39:24.760 --> 02:39:30.040]
There's nobody else nobody else has seen him come and go like Phil Costin did and now it's his turn

[02:39:30.040 --> 02:39:35.420]
Because as they say at Cox Broadcasting it's not a question of if it's a question of when

[02:39:35.820 --> 02:39:38.680]
So hang on to that Vaseline jar real tight

[02:39:39.200 --> 02:39:43.600]
W.I.O.D. Bring black to that net W.I.O.D. Hey, what's up? How you doing?

[02:39:43.840 --> 02:39:46.300]
Oh, how you doing? Uh now that you're moving you're gonna have a little bit of signal

[02:39:46.980 --> 02:39:51.080]
Uh when we get that new transmitter man. All right, it's gonna be pump. We're gonna be pumping it

[02:39:51.220 --> 02:39:52.480]
And the signal too

[02:39:54.700 --> 02:39:57.760]
I doubt it. What is it? I hope you could do it. Phil Henrag got your downers that

[02:39:58.580 --> 02:39:59.280]
Owned by Cox

[02:39:59.920 --> 02:40:05.000]
What am I? Is it owned by Cox? It's owned it's owned by us, but we don't got no time. Oh first thing tomorrow, man

[02:40:05.340 --> 02:40:08.100]
First thing tomorrow morning. All right, Neil good luck. You got it

[02:40:08.840 --> 02:40:09.880]
Maybe W.I.O.D

[02:40:11.800 --> 02:40:16.560]
W.I.O.D. Neil yes, yes, sir. I'm moving too. Where you going? I got to go to Raleigh

[02:40:17.540 --> 02:40:18.180]
North Carolina

[02:40:18.720 --> 02:40:19.080]
permanently

[02:40:20.540 --> 02:40:28.520]
Oh my god, but wow as I told my former employer kiss my butt and have a nice life. Okay. Good luck to you, sir back to you pal

[02:40:30.620 --> 02:40:33.780]
All I thought by the door, but it was gonna be my favorite coast person

[02:40:34.760 --> 02:40:37.920]
Hey, he's right behind you. I know it. I could smell him from here

[02:40:38.700 --> 02:40:40.040]
How did I know that?

[02:40:41.820 --> 02:40:43.240]
And we're now that he just go

[02:40:44.080 --> 02:40:46.640]
What is it? They're not allowed in here anymore

[02:40:46.640 --> 02:40:52.160]
Yeah, we got a new rule the coast people are allowed in here anymore. Right. We just made the rule

[02:40:52.980 --> 02:40:58.240]
Oh, that's if you had Johnny, he'll say goodbye right sure too by the way Johnny when you got to change it

[02:40:58.760 --> 02:41:03.320]
Should we do one more? Should we learn not press our luck because we're what see I never know what time we're ending on these things

[02:41:03.320 --> 02:41:05.360]
But who cares at this point for really cares

[02:41:06.940 --> 02:41:08.880]
So I think that basically wraps it up

[02:41:08.880 --> 02:41:14.000]
It's with very mixed emotions and I'm gonna get my canoe out like I said before if I had to get a canoe at ours

[02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:18.520]
And that's the only way to get out of here would what be well worth it and have the price no problem whatsoever

[02:41:18.940 --> 02:41:24.040]
So we wish all the best to some of the people in this building and to the rest of the cocks people cocks a hoist
