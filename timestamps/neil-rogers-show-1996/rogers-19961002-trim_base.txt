People are watching women are staring at their green roof and deal.

[00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.540]
But I'm not sharing some say his brainless.

[00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.020]
Now I'm not talking.

[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.120]
Not much to look at.

[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:25.200]
But I ain't looking for smells just a little too much.

[00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.760]
To that's all a little too close.

[00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.420]
His novel is just a little too long.

[00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.720]
But while they're grown in, I will be lonely darling.

[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.360]
His got a really big trowel's a trowel.

[00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.960]
Oi!

[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.980]
The girls with cream if they let it out.

[00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.620]
His got a really big trowel's a trowel.

[00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.220]
I'm fishing for love.

[00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:03.360]
His got a really big trowel's a trowel.

[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.800]
That boy can make me a just whist and shout.

[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:12.960]
His got a really big trowel's a trowel's a trowel's a trowel.

[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:32.540]
His got a really big trowel's a trowel's a trowel's a trowel's a trowel's a trowel's a trowel's a trowel's a trowel's a trowel's a trowel's a trowel's a trowel's a trowel's a trowel's a trowel.

[00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:40.320]
I'll tell ya boy, really they're coming down on us like crazy.

[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.860]
he wouldn't believe that's why all the good stuff is coming back now. 1002 at W1D. Happy Wednesday

[00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:51.680]
to you. And here we are for a return in the corner. Two more trips, two more trips, two more trips,

[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.920]
down a highway from Hellman and that's it. And this morning especially, and maybe it's going to be

[00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:01.540]
this way tomorrow and Friday, extraordinarily out of the ordinary annoying trip like through hell

[00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.200]
and date county. And that's great because this is a screw it. That's it. Two more and we're all done

[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.220]
with that crap. And we move into polatial new surroundings and then things are going to really

[00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.720]
change. Okay. These next three days to be honest with it, just the more bull crap is what it is.

[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.580]
So anyway, I don't want to start with Ron and Ron because hey, they're going to have a number,

[00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.640]
the likes of which you haven't seen. They're going to have the biggest morning numbers on this station

[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:28.080]
since before, Mike Greenery was an infant before he was an embryo. But how come it is that everybody

[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:34.420]
who interviews Drew Rosenhaus has to kiss his ass? Can you answer me that question? Here is,

[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:39.460]
I mean, even sports illustrated with their usual man-be-a-pan-be-pro-approach-to-life. Even they agree

[00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:43.000]
that here's one of the most objectionable people on the face of the earth. He kind of represents

[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.600]
everything anxious about the University of Miami about its football program, about its whole

[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:52.860]
attitude toward life. He represents everything that's obnoxious about greed. You name it. Whatever it is.

[00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.380]
And everybody who gets him on a year just kisses his ass and just loves it like all over his

[00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:02.100]
record. Oh man, this guy must be sore. Both cheeks. So maybe you can explain that to me what that's

[00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:07.960]
all about. The good news though, like I told you, no contest, man, a landslide 60 to 40, Alex

[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:15.520]
Penelus God. What did I tell you? What did I tell you? As the Miami-Herald and Mickey Erison both

[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.860]
take it up their collective rectum today. Oh, brother, is that a beautiful thing?

[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.040]
So I hate those of you who, you know, wanted to vote Republican, that's the way it goes. This is

[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.360]
the ironic part of the whole deal. And I really don't care. I just mentioned this in passing because

[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.640]
it goes to show you how phony people are. Republicans are, you know, the Republican was

[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:38.720]
our deal. Even though it's a non, you know, supposedly it's a nonpartisan deal.

[00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.440]
Or teal is the Republican former Democrat term Republican. And yet he gets the overwhelming

[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.100]
majority of the black vote who never vote Republican. On the other side, the overwhelming

[00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:51.420]
majority of the Cuban vote goes to Penelus who's a Democrat. And of course, Cubans virtually none

[00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:55.080]
of them ever vote Democratic, maybe ten of them, you know. So it goes to show you that thank God

[00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.220]
in this town, we don't vote ethnic feelings and sentiments. But who cares? Because it came out right.

[00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:05.360]
It came out as a beautiful thing. And then while I re, I'm, I hesitate to bring it up again

[00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:09.580]
today, but I realized that I must be in a very tiny minority. And I'm real happy about that.

[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:14.160]
I'm happy not to go along with the crowd one more time on this Roberto Alamart thing.

[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.860]
Because guess what? Most people don't even know what they're talking about. Most people are

[00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:23.340]
full of it, including Gordon Eads in the Sun Sentinel who writes one of the most ignorant columns

[00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:28.460]
this morning. I've ever had the privilege of seeing in my life. Great expectations. It's a shame.

[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:34.080]
Oh my God. And how, you know, I mean, baseball's got enough problems. Like I said yesterday,

[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:39.720]
most of you don't care about it anyway. But there's a vacuum of integrity in both

[00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:44.920]
in the stadium clubhouses and offer an office in her sanctums and blah, blah, blah, and no,

[00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:50.200]
no real commissioner and players against umpires and I'm fires fighting with owners and in the midst

[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.800]
of all this mud wrestling, we're supposed to care who wins the world series. Well, guess what,

[00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:57.820]
Gordon? The people are watching do care. They do care. That may come as a great shock to you,

[00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:02.460]
but they care what a concept. The people who are watching like those of us who watch some of

[00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:07.540]
the stuff yesterday. And by the way, wasn't it fascinating to watch the Orioles beat the snout out

[00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:13.360]
of Cleveland 10 to four? Oh, I loved it. I absolutely loved it. And I loved the line in Gordon

[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:18.700]
Eads column where he says after the game in which Alamart was given a standing ovation by a

[00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:24.880]
hometown crowd that apparently checked its sense of shame into turn styles. How do you like that?

[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:31.400]
The crowd, all of these people were wrong. They checked their sense of shame at the turn styles.

[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:35.100]
And like I've said before, I said yesterday, I'll say it again today after talking with a couple

[00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:38.960]
of people who really follow baseball. The last several years, including it's got to be at least

[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:44.020]
seven or eight because that's when Dave Polone's book came out. Umpires have gotten out of this power

[00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:47.720]
trip, man, and they're taunting players and they're baiting them and they're daring them to come

[00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:52.280]
out and get into way a big contract, Tom's like that. And whatever it was that he said is whatever it was

[00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:57.920]
is what got Alamart come like a madman rushing out of that dugout and start the whole argument all

[00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:02.080]
over again, which precipitated the spitting incident. And there you go. Not that it makes it right,

[00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:05.980]
but there's more than just one side and all of this and any of the and the other comments that

[00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:10.040]
were taken out of context to be quite honest with you, I think that Alamart may have a good point here.

[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:16.300]
When anybody is under that much personal stress and duress as Hirschbeck has been with the one dead

[00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:20.300]
kid and the other one that sick with the same disease, uh, it's very possible that it's affecting his

[00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:24.920]
state of mind and affecting his performance and maybe he should take a leave absence. Maybe he

[00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:29.200]
doesn't belong there, but oh no, right off the bat, everybody, you know, the predictable American

[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:33.200]
public baby rushed a judgment. Don't confuse us with the facts. He's spitting the guy's face

[00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:38.820]
therefore how to hell is he belonging there? Right. So nobody can kick the umpire out. Nobody can

[00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:42.160]
take action against the umpire and he can do whatever the hell he wants. And basically they've

[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:46.140]
taken control even though the pitch was a foot outside and even though he called him a little bleep

[00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:49.800]
sucker, whatever it was and precipitated the thing anyway. Nobody cares about that.

[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.680]
Here's Fort Lauderdale on the purple line. Hello. Yeah, Neil, happy Wednesday. Back to you.

[00:07:54.880 --> 00:08:00.260]
Couple of good things. We got pomp and a pork opening up. Yes. We have the panthers starting to play.

[00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:04.320]
Yeah, but I was going to get to that. That sports channel business is looking pretty marginal.

[00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:12.500]
And we have Alex Penelope winning. Yes. Oh, I'm losing my turn to thought. Let's see what else we have going.

[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:20.420]
Yeah, exactly. That's what I lost it. I lost it. I will. I will. I will look for it if I find it.

[00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:24.240]
I'll speak to you later. Well, see if Mickey Ererson finds it before you do. Thank you. Okay,

[00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:28.100]
pal. Let's hope not. Okay. We have an open line on a purple line pound IOD. We have two in

[00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:31.620]
day. We got two in brown. We got a million like always and I don't care today. Yesterday I

[00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:36.480]
was distraught. Man, I was so I've been out of shape and legitimately. I mean, usually it's

[00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:40.720]
stick. You know, but yesterday I was really pissed off. The first official Paxing Day in this

[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:44.860]
audience is playing their hide and seek routine like you wouldn't believe it was just, but you

[00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:49.920]
know something who cares? Because I know that when I sit here and I say crap that nobody else is

[00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:53.740]
going to say and when I, yeah, it's, it's just phenomenal to me that there are so many

[00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:58.960]
ass kissers in this world. If there's one thing you don't want to be is an ass kisser. As a matter

[00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:03.220]
of fact, here's a, there's a lesson for Roberto Alamar Jr. I'd rather be a sucker.

[00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:09.980]
Having experience than a ass kisser. How do you like that? There's nothing to me

[00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:17.280]
worse than a weaselies spineless ass kisser. Somebody with no backbone. Here's a mobile at D'Areal. Hello.

[00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:22.420]
Neil. Yes, sir. Listen, I have to disagree with you on with Roberto Alamar. Yeah.

[00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:27.060]
Yeah. Just just because one does not justify the other. Speeding is really one of the lowest

[00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:34.140]
forms of of ill mannerism and of sporting. I guess just to have something spitting is really an

[00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:38.000]
insult as far as no matter what. So in other words, if somebody calls you a little

[00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:42.740]
sucker, that's not an insult and he didn't precipitate it. Yeah, of course, but one, but too

[00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:46.600]
wrong to make a right. I didn't say it was right, but I'm saying that if somebody, if somebody

[00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:51.000]
egged someone else into creating the incident and then tries to make a martyr out of himself,

[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:56.620]
I'm not buying it. They were both wrong. Yeah, it's just, it's, I mean, spitting is just really

[00:09:56.620 --> 00:10:00.540]
crossing the line when it comes out to it. I mean, Roberto Alamar should have had enough

[00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:04.720]
intelligence to maybe, let me, let me ask you something. Do you think Roberto Alamar is a hothead?

[00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:09.600]
I, you know, I think the majority of these sports people have big heads to begin with.

[00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:14.120]
No, no, no, I'm not talking about your opinion about generalizing. Does Roberto Alamar have a

[00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:18.740]
reputation like Albert Bell or Gary Sheffield or Barry Barnes? Does he have that? I mean, do you

[00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:24.020]
even follow baseball? Not not whatsoever, but I had not even followed baseball. I don't know

[00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:29.820]
anything about Roberto Alamar or Sandy Alamar or Sandy Amaro or any of these people, but that's

[00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:33.980]
off the focus, even though even if I don't follow. It's not off the focus. It's not off the focus.

[00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:38.400]
It's like if somebody who's got a reputation, who's a future Hall of Fame player, who's got a

[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:43.720]
reputation as a level-headed, reasonable person is goaded and baited into doing something that

[00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:49.340]
grotesque, there must have been pretty ample reason for it. I don't know. It's just, it's not, I mean,

[00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:53.000]
there could be ample reason for somebody going out and killing somebody and somebody else. It's just,

[00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:57.040]
it's just, it's not, it's spitting in somebody's face is a step away from killing somebody. Is that it?

[00:10:57.460 --> 00:11:02.520]
Is that what you said? No, no, of course not. But I mean, listen, if the empire would have struck

[00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:06.820]
him over to maybe taking a swing in him, but it's all intercourse. It's all verbal intercourse.

[00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:10.060]
Yeah, that's, you know, that's the bottom layer. I didn't know they had intercourse.

[00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:14.240]
Well, who knows? Maybe that was the problem. There's a lot of fitting now to have that. Maybe it wasn't,

[00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:19.640]
maybe it wasn't too good. One more thing, Neil, I heard something in the run and run show this morning,

[00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:24.000]
by the way, I seem to like the format. I thought it would not like run and run, but they seem to be

[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.840]
pretty good, quite honestly. I love her. How do you like that? How do you like that? Yeah, we want,

[00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:31.860]
we want everybody out there to love all of us. And if they can't love all of us, at least most of us.

[00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:34.180]
And at least you are. And if not most of us, at least me, right?

[00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:38.980]
At least you. Listen, one more thing. I just talk about the evolution thing. I caught the tail end of it.

[00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:41.400]
I'm not sure if you have any knowledge of what has, what has happened.

[00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:46.000]
Yeah, I think I think a running round will say that most of the audience were Neanderthals is what they said.

[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.720]
Oh, that one it is. Yeah, I think that was it. Have a great day, pal.

[00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:51.540]
Have a good day. Bye. I think they said if you want to monkey around with the little

[00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:53.740]
sucker, you better watch yourself. Isn't that what he said?

[00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:58.500]
So anyway, getting back to Drew Rosenhouse. Now, let's not even waste our time with him. He's just a

[00:11:58.550 --> 00:12:02.590]
piece of crap and I was Brian Blades doing by the way. That just he's got this thing. He must have the

[00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:08.810]
pictures on everybody. Drew Rosenhouse. Because even a DFO and of course we know that DFO would never kiss any

[00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:15.270]
rectum first, not but boy, last time he had him on there. Oh, man, likey, likey, likey, likey, likey,

[00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:19.650]
that this guy must have had to towel down after that interview. And again, the same one this morning,

[00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:26.830]
oh, that's why we respect you so much. And of course, we know that the Eric ret making the 386,000 year

[00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:30.430]
isn't nearly enough. And all these other guys are making this much and the fans over there on the

[00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:34.610]
West Coast are like, oh, and five and going to be all in six and all in 14, oh, and 16. And the

[00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:37.850]
who cares about that? But just to pony up the money and if you want to see the game.

[00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:44.170]
It's a joke. He, I mean, he's one of the worst symptoms of the illness.

[00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:49.710]
In greed and professional sports, which we are expected to subsidize and pay for and yet nobody

[00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:53.510]
cares. And then everybody keeps bringing up the thing like about Tom Cruise. Now, he's getting

[00:12:53.510 --> 00:12:58.470]
30 million for a movie. You know, something the cost of going to a movie, no matter how much he's

[00:12:58.470 --> 00:13:02.170]
getting, the cost of going to a movie is still five or six bucks and it has been for years.

[00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:08.230]
So it doesn't, you're not being gouged for however much he's making, even though it's way out of

[00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:12.110]
proportion for his value and all of that other bull crap. Of course, he knows where all the chicks are.

[00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:20.710]
Tom Cruise. Right. Probably at the sperm bank. Oh, sorry, Tom. Sorry, Tom. Here's a mobile

[00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:26.150]
in Fort Lauderdale. Hello. Good morning, Neil. Where does DS Amigo listen out of desperation

[00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:31.290]
this morning? I happen to be listening to the worst team. Yeah. And you are desperate.

[00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:36.450]
Well, and by the way, more good news. It's official because it's in the newspaper that Angelou

[00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:41.310]
Brian are going to TV and Randolph and Carter are gone. Oh, thank God. That's a beautiful thing.

[00:13:41.390 --> 00:13:46.610]
I might even start watching a few Marlon games next season. There you go. Well, anyway, I hear of,

[00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:53.930]
you know, a frustrated talk show host. They can't stop calling shows. There is this morning calling

[00:13:54.890 --> 00:14:01.310]
Joe Rose with a vitriolic attack just just attacking the crap out of Joe Rose. The man just can't

[00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:06.510]
be a lawyer. You know what I mean? Do you know what I'm talking about? Norm Kent. Norman Elliott

[00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:13.450]
Kent. Yeah. The man he called Joe Rose on here. Desperate for radio time. Yeah. That he calls

[00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:18.790]
up and attacks Joe Rose trying to get what he attacked Joe Rose for. Oh, because Joe Rose said

[00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:24.030]
that there was some guys that showed up late to practice 15 years ago when he was playing and Norm

[00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:29.490]
called up and said, I want you to I demand that you give the names of these people. Don't just make

[00:14:29.490 --> 00:14:33.550]
a general, you know, generalization. He was doing like the attorney thing, but it was unbelievable.

[00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:38.770]
And Joe Rose just blew him off and called him an idiot. Yeah. So I just want to let you know

[00:14:38.770 --> 00:14:42.470]
what your attorney's up to. Well, at least Joe Rose is talking to him. I guess nobody else over

[00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:47.070]
there is. So that's that's a start norm. And great news about him. Greg Reed won't talk to him

[00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:51.850]
or anybody else that he supposedly hired. If you if you if you had any idea, which I will be able to

[00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:56.850]
tell you probably next week, if you had any idea of the shenanigans of QAM that have been going on

[00:14:56.850 --> 00:15:00.470]
the last few months and are still going on now, you wouldn't you wouldn't even believe it. Your

[00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:04.330]
head would spin around like Linda Blair. You couldn't even begin to imagine. Will it be for going

[00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:09.470]
there? You're asking me? You nobody knows if they're going there because they're will you listen to

[00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:14.090]
me? Nobody knows if they're going there because nobody's returning any phone calls. People are being

[00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:18.210]
promised all kinds of jobs. And then when they try to find out, well, when do I start and all the

[00:15:18.210 --> 00:15:21.910]
they're even being they're even promising people specific amounts of money they're making deals

[00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:26.970]
with people and then they don't return to calls. So nobody has got any idea what's going to

[00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:30.950]
including that puttsbury Jackson. They keep feeding him and misinformation and they keep

[00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:36.290]
stirring out to be a jackass, which we already knew. It's unbelievable. It's typical Bush League

[00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:41.790]
South Florida radio and business. Have a great day pal. Okay, tell him I said hi and get off the

[00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:49.470]
ear and go do it. Go do his job. Open line in day 751. We got one in Broward 5249463 524WIOD.

[00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:55.270]
Yeah, let's not let's not look at both sides of the story and at Roberto Alamar thing. The crowd

[00:15:55.270 --> 00:16:00.370]
checked its sense of shame at the turn styles. Gordon, that's right. They have no shame. They're just

[00:16:00.370 --> 00:16:04.910]
shameless fans who'll do anything for a win and support their orals all the way to Helen back.

[00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:11.030]
Okay, that's what that's all about. Whatever you say, man, because we know the umpires can do

[00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:14.970]
no wrong and umpires do not they never bait the players, never precipitate any kind of a thing.

[00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:17.970]
Right? Course 1015 at WIOD. Yo.

[00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:20.750]
Oh,

[00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:22.250]
16 WIOD.

[00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:24.690]
How the hell are you? How the hell are you?

[00:16:24.890 --> 00:16:25.730]
How the hell are you?

[00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:28.450]
How the hell are you?

[00:16:28.450 --> 00:16:28.990]
How the hell are you?

[00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:29.670]
How the hell are you?

[00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:41.970]
The other night was there a fight on the port of July.

[00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:48.420]
Cause now his cousin's dead up all it in the head.

[00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:49.860]
What happened?

[00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:52.160]
We don't know.

[00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:57.780]
Something fishy smells but he won't tell.

[00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:01.960]
So well, last Brian.

[00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:04.740]
What did you do?

[00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:06.260]
Brian.

[00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:09.500]
What did you do?

[00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:13.580]
He's not so long.

[00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:20.340]
He was standing on his folks lawn and he was crying.

[00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:22.680]
Brian.

[00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:24.340]
Brian.

[00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:26.340]
Brian.

[00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:28.200]
Brian.

[00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:31.780]
It's hard to understand.

[00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:39.020]
It was an accident with two shots flying.

[00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:50.320]
I don't know why your agent crew claims the cops report so much.

[00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:50.540]
I don't know why your agent crew.

[00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:53.860]
I want you to know some more.

[00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:56.260]
So tell me what's the score.

[00:17:57.220 --> 00:17:57.800]
Brian.

[00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:00.340]
What did you do?

[00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:04.680]
He's not so long.

[00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:07.640]
He's not so long.

[00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:08.240]
He's not so long.

[00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:09.440]
He's not so long.

[00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:11.660]
He's not so long.

[00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:14.820]
He's not so long.

[00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:18.820]
He's not so long.

[00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:19.760]
He's not so long.

[00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:21.540]
Yes.

[00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:23.780]
Now he's gone.

[00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:30.600]
And from this moment on, we're asking Brian.

[00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:32.920]
Brian.

[00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:35.300]
Brian.

[00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:37.760]
Brian.

[00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:39.380]
Brian.

[00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:40.020]
Brian.

[00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:43.240]
Oh.

[00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:45.460]
Brian.

[00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:46.080]
Brian.

[00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:49.280]
Oh.

[00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:52.040]
I did.

[00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:53.960]
You did.

[00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:57.780]
I wish you wanted to do those houses greatest chapters in his ongoing

[00:18:57.780 --> 00:19:01.320]
Sago when he said, hey, we don't have time for this crap. He's got to play football.

[00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:03.300]
Man, he's got to run fast and jump high.

[00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:06.000]
And Seattle's getting the stonk beat out of him and I sure like that.

[00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:07.940]
Anyway, I do want to straighten the record out.

[00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:11.480]
Yesterday, remember when our friends, our good close personal friends, the packs

[00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:12.840]
and people came in here and brought me lunch.

[00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:16.920]
And they're Rhonda Finkwolf and the Pete Bouldier and Jim Bokock,

[00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:19.600]
who's like Buddy Buds, right hand and left hand man.

[00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:23.640]
And after they left, I said, you know, that Jim Bokock, isn't that family like an

[00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:24.340]
Affurniture business?

[00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:28.400]
That's bad cock furniture, which is a big, I guess I had my cock smick stuff.

[00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:31.980]
But that was like, well, you know, between cock's broadcasting and all the other

[00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:36.840]
stuff. So I guess I had him confused. So I apologize profusely because boy,

[00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:40.580]
they still love us so far. It's just amazing. You have no idea. You couldn't even imagine.

[00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:44.960]
Here's the Miami Beach. You're a Miami or somewhere like that. Hello. Yes, sir.

[00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:47.380]
I have some shocking things to tell you. Shocking, huh?

[00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:51.340]
The other day we were watching the sports wrap, whatever you call it.

[00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:53.920]
With sports crap, yeah. With mandatory watch and face.

[00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:55.040]
Yeah, what's this push?

[00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:59.100]
You and Rose first started, and my wife came in the room and guess what she said?

[00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:00.920]
Oh, that guy is cute.

[00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:05.200]
Rosenhouse was on. Yes. That what you just said?

[00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:07.640]
Yes. And what is this? That guy's cute.

[00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:09.760]
Oh, God. Can you believe that?

[00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:15.740]
Well, maybe her eyesight's failing. Well, boy, I was going to say maybe she's got bad taste, but you know,

[00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:17.040]
what can I tell you?

[00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:20.780]
A couple of other things. I mean, I was listening to the noise-peaketing class

[00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:25.420]
station. I'm a Shane of being a cubit. Some of the crap has been said on that.

[00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:28.360]
Neil, talking about racism. Yeah.

[00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:34.860]
Talking about election without issues. It's only a, it's just down to, it just down to race.

[00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:39.040]
Right. You both are here because it's cubit. And forget about what he believes in.

[00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:40.780]
It doesn't matter what he believes it. Right.

[00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:42.520]
Is cubit? Oh, that's right.

[00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:47.640]
Almost all the Cubans voted for panels. Almost all the blacks voted for Teal and never the Twain shall meet.

[00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:50.520]
They don't care. Democrat Republican communist face.

[00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:54.240]
She's the, they don't care, man. There's the Cuban. That's my guy. There's the black guy. That's my guy.

[00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:55.880]
That's, that's, that's it.

[00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:59.840]
Look at him. Highly, they have that guy who was, what's his face?

[00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:02.540]
Raul Martinez. Yeah. He's a little. He never stole a freight train.

[00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:05.380]
He never stole a freight train. So they would love him and they want him been there for life.

[00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:08.500]
And they don't give a crap. And if it turns out that he's really Puerto Rican, he's out.

[00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:14.080]
A couple of other things this morning. Let's start a rumor that Raul Martinez is Puerto Rican. How do you like that?

[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:17.660]
Oh, by the way, they might swish their votes or their blades in a hurry speaking of Brian.

[00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:21.760]
Some guy called you the other day and told you that Alex Alex Alex the guy.

[00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:23.860]
And it Alex panelists Bennett.

[00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:27.360]
So the guy who plays baseball in the Seattle Alice Rodriguez.

[00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:30.020]
Alice Rodriguez. I didn't know his name was Alice.

[00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:35.500]
Alice. No wonder they won't write about him. He won the he won a batting championship in the American league. He's great.

[00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:41.000]
Meal like Alice Rantel. I mean, yeah, he is not Puerto Rican. He's Cuban Alex Rodriguez.

[00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:44.140]
Yes. Is Cuban and they still don't write anything about him here?

[00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:47.180]
Correct. I'm going to tell you something. I really mean this because I you know with a satellite.

[00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:51.720]
I see a lot of their games and I watched him play a lot. This this kid is phenomenal. He's unbelievable.

[00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:55.500]
This should be the biggest story in the history of sports in his town.

[00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:58.540]
And what are they writing about the same old crap? Same old crap.

[00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:02.900]
Even dolphins cut keyt buyers like that. So surprise. We knew Jimmy blow his ass out of there.

[00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:08.800]
Bob cost of satellite. This kid can be or is the best thing that ever happened.

[00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:11.780]
I'm going to tell you if he stays healthy. How old is he? 21 now I think?

[00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:16.400]
Twenty or 21. He stays healthy. He's already a shoe in for the Hall of Fame. How do you like that?

[00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:19.440]
Absolutely. I guarantee it. Now you can bet your life on it.

[00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:22.040]
Listen to the geniuses of the WQAM this morning.

[00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:26.300]
Yes. Steve Goldouche. What are you calling him?

[00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:32.880]
Yeah. He said, well, you know, with a dish, you shouldn't go buy a dish because you cannot even get sports channels on some of the dishes.

[00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:38.800]
And I said, wait a minute on the big dish. You can get it. And in the little dish that has been taking care of it.

[00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:42.800]
It has. Well, they're working on it. But there's a possible today. You can get it.

[00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:45.940]
Yeah. But you can get it. If you live long enough, I'm not so sure.

[00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:49.040]
I'm a little lary on his sports channel. Man, they're starting to get me real nervous.

[00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:51.640]
But me or even on the little dish. You can get it. Not yet.

[00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:55.760]
That sounds like comedies more to me. Yeah. It's on the big dish right now.

[00:22:55.760 --> 00:23:00.520]
But I mean, it would have to be there. But I if it's it's and I got continental cable.

[00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:04.620]
It is not on my cable, which today is the second. It's the third or second of October.

[00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:06.960]
Whatever it is. It's three days before the opening Panther game.

[00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:11.260]
And it's not on a small dish yet, which it's three days before the opening telecast.

[00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:14.820]
And I'm beginning to wonder if anybody's got the damn thing other than on the big dish.

[00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:17.920]
I'm telling you the big ones are always better than little ones.

[00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:22.520]
Yeah. That's what you think. Oh, well, that's not what I say. Well, another thing. Well,

[00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:26.820]
Ray Shepherd is out one to three weeks with a separated shoulder there. Whatever it is.

[00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:31.620]
We're pretty pissed off about that. And how come they kept that news so quiet until I had to hear about it on newscast?

[00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:34.480]
How come nobody told me that? Oh, you know what?

[00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:38.060]
How come somebody who's supposed to be giving me all this good hockey information is so busy hockey

[00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:41.220]
to China can drive a mean nuts and try to make me fight his battles for him?

[00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:44.980]
How come he didn't tell me that a separated shoulder had Ray Shepherd out one to three weeks?

[00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:51.160]
Oh, listen to this yesterday the the ass of program director. Yeah. He denied yesterday afternoon.

[00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:53.520]
The rush was going to I.m. Z.

[00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:57.920]
Well, that's because they got it for another week or something like that. I don't know.

[00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.540]
But come on. He was in today's hero.

[00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:05.120]
But, but you know the end. What was in the herald that they made it official and they have one line by by you.

[00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:07.840]
And that said you were the king of a box show in the county.

[00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:13.360]
It's in the hero. Do we have a hero? Can we cause there's no papers near any more in part?

[00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:17.000]
Let's go see if we can scrounge what I'll give you forward to join. Whatever you call it.

[00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:22.360]
It's in the death section. The herald by the way should have a death section today in honor of getting whipped in the election last night.

[00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:28.300]
And I love that Alex Peralis right out of the box said, hey, one of my big priorities is going to be to make sure to defeat this arena thing.

[00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:29.820]
Oh, by the way, nice going Alex.

[00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:34.680]
All right. Hey, Neil, tell George not to go cargar. Well, you're on the air, please.

[00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:37.260]
He's smoking one right now. Get out of here pal. All right.

[00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:41.420]
See you. Bye. I'll read the urge. Yeah, no cagarr. Okay. No more cagarr.

[00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:43.680]
I'll take one by the way if you got a little one.

[00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:47.220]
We have an open line in day 751. Oh, do we have the herald?

[00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:50.780]
It's probably another one of those Barry Jackson column fetching it right now.

[00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:53.440]
See, one of the interesting things is they've been feeding Barry Jackson.

[00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:57.140]
I'm almost beginning to wonder intentionally misinformation from over to a QM.

[00:24:57.280 --> 00:25:02.620]
And of course, very dutifully he puts it in there like Jimmy Cifilis is going to be doing a show Jimmy Cifilis don't know nothing about it.

[00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:05.540]
How do you like that? Thank you so much, Adam. You're just a real.

[00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:09.100]
It's so good to have Adam here really early in the morning sucking her mind like Andy did.

[00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:14.940]
Hey, look what it did for him. Got him to the big time. He sucked his all the way. He sucked his all the way to the big city.

[00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:18.280]
So do you want to bow? He's doing the work since he had a.

[00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:20.780]
I have a licensee out, or please?

[00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:24.000]
Talking entertainment radio.

[00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:27.720]
610 W I O D. Who runs this place?

[00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:29.020]
I don't know.

[00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:42.400]
Put on my five own ways and I head for the street.

[00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:50.360]
Just took down the best of hustle and I'm starting to feel the heat.

[00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:50.900]
Oi.

[00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:56.740]
Suddenly I see people checking out my buttons.

[00:25:56.740 --> 00:25:57.540]
I see.

[00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:01.400]
Yeah, I got a first class riser.

[00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:04.020]
It done pitched to 10.

[00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:05.060]
My jeans.

[00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:07.620]
Now I was born in a woodie.

[00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:12.320]
I'm finding it impossible to conceal.

[00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:15.140]
I'm spotted a woodie.

[00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:19.960]
I feel like an absolute out of real.

[00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:26.120]
So the ghost of the house.

[00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:29.240]
He was part one too.

[00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:33.280]
He caught Adam up to the gates of basement.

[00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:37.240]
Just to see what he would do.

[00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:44.140]
The ghost of the face was beaming as he headed for his room.

[00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:47.480]
There's a pretty little ghost.

[00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:51.800]
He's waiting for his post down in the jungle room.

[00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:54.140]
We're spotting woodies in Memphis.

[00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:56.100]
You turn.

[00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:59.540]
It's nearly impossible to conceal.

[00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:01.800]
Spotting woodies in Memphis.

[00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:06.540]
I feel like an actual woodie.

[00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:09.280]
Spotting woodies in Memphis.

[00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:14.440]
It's almost impossible to conceal.

[00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:16.900]
Spotting woodies in Memphis.

[00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:18.020]
Welcome.

[00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:24.260]
I feel like I'm emancipated man.

[00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:26.940]
I feel like Martin Luther, whatever his name was, I don't get smart.

[00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:29.120]
It's 1034 at WIOD.

[00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:30.120]
We're free again, man.

[00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:30.840]
We're free at last.

[00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:32.560]
Two more trips.

[00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:33.660]
Two more trips.

[00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:35.120]
Down the highway from hell.

[00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:35.740]
We got out of this.

[00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:37.800]
We got out of this wonderful neighborhood.

[00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:40.100]
Since Rick Sanchez moved in, it's gone to crap.

[00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:42.300]
That's what they said.

[00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:44.760]
Bill Ross, as soon as that man squatted into that building,

[00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:46.020]
he said there goes the damn neighborhood.

[00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:46.560]
He was right.

[00:27:47.180 --> 00:27:49.040]
So here's the article speaking of fat people.

[00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:51.720]
It says limba moves to WIENZ starting on Monday.

[00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:54.360]
By Frank Davies, who is not Barry Jackson,

[00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:56.860]
so maybe there might be some accurate information in here for a change.

[00:27:57.100 --> 00:28:00.380]
It's that little Barry Jackson, who's nothing but a Yanta and a troublemaker.

[00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:02.200]
And gets it wrong almost all the time.

[00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:03.080]
We know you're listening, Barry.

[00:28:03.340 --> 00:28:03.680]
Get it right.

[00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:04.880]
Just once in your life would be good.

[00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:05.740]
Just one time.

[00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:09.680]
Rush Limbaugh, the 800-pound guerrilla of talk radio with Seiz,

[00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:12.360]
has been bumped by a 900-pound guerrilla sports talk radio.

[00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:16.980]
WCWAM 560 adopting an all sports far, far, far mark,

[00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:19.480]
is dropping the conservative talker's popular show.

[00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:20.500]
Popular show.

[00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:24.320]
The guy's got a two-share, has never broken a two-share in how, what was it?

[00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:25.820]
Three, four, five years now in the market?

[00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:27.260]
His popular show.

[00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:30.060]
It's popular somewhere, but not here, which it goes on to say later.

[00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:33.920]
And WIENZ with its emphasis on news is picking it up starting Monday.

[00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:37.240]
Limbaugh will be heard weekends from 1 to 4 p.m. on WIENZ,

[00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:41.280]
which will also carry Laura Slesinger's syndicated personal advice program

[00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:42.620]
from 10 a.m. to noon.

[00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:44.440]
So now we're really up against it.

[00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:48.880]
Now we got only, not only Rush to combat with, but we got Dr. Laura.

[00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:50.460]
Oh boy, I can't handle that.

[00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:51.740]
There go all our four women.

[00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:54.260]
They'll be right over to Dr. Laura, so she can bitch him out.

[00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:56.900]
Rush and Laura, our great communicator,

[00:28:57.040 --> 00:29:00.180]
said our close personal friend, Pete Boulder of WIENZ program director.

[00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:02.140]
Although one is political and one is full of crap,

[00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:05.440]
they both feel strongly about individuals taking responsibility for their actions,

[00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:06.220]
says for Pete.

[00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:10.600]
Limbaugh's departure from QAM had been openly discussed for months and months

[00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:13.860]
with the sale of the station to Beasley Broadcasting, WQAM,

[00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:16.040]
will add another sports talk show in the noon to 3 slot,

[00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:17.360]
and I'll occupy by Lardice.

[00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:20.980]
It's the evolution of our formats that Andrew Asson,

[00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:22.900]
the Woods, WQAM's program director.

[00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:25.520]
Our primary consumer wants to be all sports.

[00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:26.780]
He wants us to be all sports.

[00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:29.040]
Are they supposed to forget they were all sports?

[00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:32.240]
Remember those days when they had the Dave O'Brien?

[00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:34.720]
By the way, congratulations, Dave and Joe,

[00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:37.160]
when they had Dave O'Brien and the who was with Zagaki.

[00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:38.260]
Oh my god.

[00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:40.400]
And they had like fractions, man.

[00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:42.020]
They had numbers that were so small.

[00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:44.220]
You had the Palomar telescope just to see it.

[00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:47.480]
And the number two, as effective an entertainer as Limbaugh is,

[00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:51.480]
this was a marriage that didn't necessarily make sense, says Andrew Asson, the Woods.

[00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:54.900]
And it goes on to say this and say that speaking of Limbaugh,

[00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:56.840]
it said he's so far ahead of whoever's second or third.

[00:29:56.840 --> 00:29:57.760]
It's not even close.

[00:29:57.980 --> 00:30:01.500]
Said Brett Moss, editor of Talk Daily, a radio industry newsletter.

[00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:03.420]
But South Florida is different, it says.

[00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:07.680]
Here, Neil Rogers on WIOD610, his talk show, champ from 10am to 2pm.

[00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:11.320]
Limbaugh never performed here as well as he did in the rest of the nation,

[00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:15.240]
said Asson Woods, admitting that WQAM did not promote the show successfully.

[00:30:15.660 --> 00:30:17.020]
Right, emphasized the suck part.

[00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:20.840]
Along with adding Limbaugh and the slushed new WIOD610 out several other changes,

[00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:21.720]
which we don't care about.

[00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:22.580]
So there you go.

[00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:24.740]
Limbaugh and I and Z starting on Monday,

[00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:26.820]
and a new sports midday show,

[00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:29.960]
part of which we can be sure will be the fat bitch from 10 to noon.

[00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:32.660]
And noon to three, your guess is as good as mine.

[00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:35.300]
Huh?

[00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:36.600]
Sure won't be rumour.

[00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:39.420]
Sure won't be a syphilis.

[00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:41.900]
It won't be Ned the sandy beach.

[00:30:42.620 --> 00:30:44.320]
It won't be who's it going to be?

[00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:47.060]
Maybe the Hummer's going to be on from noon to seven every day, huh?

[00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:49.560]
He can have lunch, a little afternoon snack,

[00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:51.460]
and dinner all on the same show, outstanding.

[00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:52.520]
Nice going, Hummer.

[00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:52.800]
Oh!

[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:54.080]
You're okay in my book, pal.

[00:30:55.060 --> 00:30:56.120]
Here's Delray Beach.

[00:30:56.300 --> 00:30:56.400]
Hello.

[00:30:57.140 --> 00:30:57.480]
Hey, Neil.

[00:30:57.660 --> 00:30:57.980]
Yes, sir.

[00:30:58.060 --> 00:30:58.460]
How you doing?

[00:30:58.640 --> 00:30:58.800]
Great.

[00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:02.260]
Listen, in regards to that all of my incidents,

[00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:03.520]
I agree with you.

[00:31:03.740 --> 00:31:05.740]
I don't think he's a hardhead like Albert Bell.

[00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:06.100]
Right.

[00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:08.200]
But I'll tell you one thing.

[00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:10.240]
If they're going to suspend them for five,

[00:31:10.340 --> 00:31:13.160]
then they might as well suspend all the other managers

[00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:14.340]
and all that that wind up arguing.

[00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:16.040]
Do you see how close they get when they argue?

[00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:16.480]
Oh, yeah.

[00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:19.420]
Do you remember when Don Zimmer and Earl Weaver were notorious

[00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:23.840]
for kicking dirt on guys shoes and up on an almost in their face?

[00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:25.460]
Billy Martin, the same thing.

[00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:28.180]
Yeah, but, and then another incident that I'm looking at is,

[00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:31.020]
how do we know that why he spit at him?

[00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:31.880]
I mean, we don't know what this kind of call is.

[00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:32.300]
That's right.

[00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:35.420]
Look, anybody who's going to make a judgment on this

[00:31:35.420 --> 00:31:37.540]
has got to first at least see the tape,

[00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:39.520]
which most of us have seen 400 times, okay?

[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.660]
He calls him out on a pitch that's over a foot outside.

[00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:44.620]
The Orioles are fighting tooth and nail

[00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:46.460]
to win the spot and a playoff.

[00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:48.400]
He calls him out on a ridiculous pitch.

[00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:49.560]
It's a grotesque call.

[00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:51.780]
They argue, Alamar goes back to the dugout.

[00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:54.380]
And then, as you know, they're screaming from the dugout,

[00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:55.820]
her speck yells into there at him

[00:31:55.820 --> 00:31:57.800]
and the report that we get from a pretty good source is,

[00:31:58.020 --> 00:31:59.620]
he called him a little bleep sucker.

[00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:01.500]
And then they come running back out again.

[00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:04.080]
Alamar followed by David Johnson, whose face is followed apart,

[00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:04.940]
all over his cheek.

[00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:08.320]
And then at that point, they get another thing again

[00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:10.920]
and Alamar spits in his face, but her speck evidently,

[00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:13.460]
and obviously from what you see, provoked this incident,

[00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:16.320]
which doesn't make it right, but then her speck isn't right either.

[00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:19.440]
Who says the umpires now have the right to start doing whatever they want

[00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:20.800]
and nobody's ever going to discipline them?

[00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:21.700]
I'll tell you another thing.

[00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:22.440]
Who the hell are they?

[00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:24.540]
When he was talking about the incident

[00:32:24.540 --> 00:32:27.460]
in the runway that happened about him talking about his kid,

[00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:29.800]
maybe what he, I think that maybe what he told them was,

[00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:31.900]
ever since the incident happened in your family,

[00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:33.420]
maybe you haven't been the same person.

[00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:35.020]
No, he didn't tell him that.

[00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:36.020]
He said that to reporters.

[00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:37.160]
He didn't tell them to his post.

[00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:37.780]
So you go with them.

[00:32:37.820 --> 00:32:39.800]
And he heard about it second hand,

[00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:41.600]
which right off the bat leaves you, you know,

[00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:43.500]
to wonder because it was taking out a context,

[00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:45.520]
the year about second hand, and he went ballistic

[00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:47.920]
and just lost it and ran down the corridor

[00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:49.740]
and into the locker room and he had to be restrained

[00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:50.400]
by the other umpires.

[00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:51.560]
They dragged his ass out of there.

[00:32:51.660 --> 00:32:52.340]
And he apologized.

[00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:53.680]
He wrote a letter. He apologized.

[00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:55.600]
And they still, you have to, they held up the end day.

[00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:59.180]
And they donated $100,000 between Alamar personally

[00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:00.960]
and the Orioles to the research foundation

[00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:02.700]
that's doing research on that disease.

[00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:04.420]
And that's still not good enough.

[00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:06.820]
Let me remind you, I don't know if you follow hockey at all.

[00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:08.300]
Oh, no, not really.

[00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:10.940]
But during the playoffs last year when Claude Lemieux

[00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:14.840]
came from behind and sticked and rammed Chris Draper

[00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:16.200]
of the Trojan into the boards and nearly,

[00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:18.480]
nearly killed this guy, nearly took his head off.

[00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:18.800]
Okay.

[00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:21.880]
He got a two game suspension is all he got.

[00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:24.540]
And granted it wasn't, you know, he couldn't appeal it

[00:33:24.540 --> 00:33:25.660]
because he didn't have the opportunity.

[00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:28.140]
It was the, you know, the league Brian Burke said

[00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:29.700]
you're going to serve the next two games in the playoffs.

[00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:30.500]
And he got it right away.

[00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:33.180]
But here's a guy who nearly kills a man.

[00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:36.300]
Chris Draper's face was in such disarray that they would,

[00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:37.840]
he wanted to come back and sit on the bench.

[00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:39.920]
They wouldn't let him sit on the bench because they thought

[00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:42.680]
that the players would go nuts if they saw how bad he looked.

[00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:44.600]
They didn't want anybody to see him.

[00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:46.820]
It's a miracle that that kid looks as good as he does now.

[00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:49.500]
And it's just, he nearly killed this guy.

[00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:50.500]
He gets two games.

[00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:52.960]
I'll tell you another guy spits in the Empire's face

[00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:55.820]
and his bait is probably baited to do it.

[00:33:55.820 --> 00:33:58.300]
And right away, oh, geez, this is the end of the world.

[00:33:58.520 --> 00:33:59.600]
People are going off the deep end.

[00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:00.420]
They all got an opinion.

[00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:02.940]
Imagine if Albert Bell would have been the one

[00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:04.440]
that would have done that to that Empire.

[00:34:04.540 --> 00:34:05.520]
I don't think he would have spit at him.

[00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:07.220]
I think he would have taken a form to his face.

[00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:07.980]
Yeah, probably.

[00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:11.120]
You know, another thing, the guy that called earlier

[00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:13.040]
that mentioned about Alex Rodriguez being Cuban,

[00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:16.800]
I read a article, a big article on him on USA Sports.

[00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:18.180]
He's, he's Puerto Rican.

[00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:19.080]
Yeah.

[00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:21.700]
And he's single and I don't know if he's circumcised.

[00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:22.140]
Is he hung?

[00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:23.660]
I don't know.

[00:34:23.660 --> 00:34:24.220]
We don't know that.

[00:34:24.220 --> 00:34:26.340]
Well, well, we do have to find out if he circumcised.

[00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:27.880]
I'm sure that somebody, that didn't go to see,

[00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:28.840]
he went to school here, right?

[00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:29.700]
Yeah, he went to school.

[00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:32.400]
He's good friends with Derek Jeter of the Yankees.

[00:34:32.620 --> 00:34:33.520]
Oh, Derek Jeter.

[00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:34.640]
He had a tough night last night.

[00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:35.920]
Bad break, Derek, too bad.

[00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:37.700]
Texas six Yankees, too.

[00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:38.040]
Oh!

[00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:40.040]
John Birkett, I'm not good enough for the Marlins,

[00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:41.440]
but evidently good enough for Texas.

[00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:43.500]
And Darryl Strawberry screwed everything up, too.

[00:34:43.640 --> 00:34:43.740]
Yes.

[00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:44.400]
I loved it.

[00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:46.340]
Oh, man, do I love watching the Yankees lose?

[00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:48.080]
I get sexual excitement watching that.

[00:34:48.140 --> 00:34:48.780]
You have no idea.

[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:49.660]
Oh, I love it.

[00:34:49.680 --> 00:34:51.840]
Bill, listen, I want to tell you your grace,

[00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:54.680]
your great under radio, and I always listen to your show

[00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:56.060]
during work time and take care.

[00:34:56.160 --> 00:34:56.900]
And I'm a great American.

[00:34:57.100 --> 00:34:57.480]
You know it.

[00:34:57.500 --> 00:34:58.280]
Thanks for the info pal.

[00:34:58.300 --> 00:35:00.220]
Okay, so let's find out.

[00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:01.980]
Is Alex Rodriguez really Cuban?

[00:35:01.980 --> 00:35:02.780]
Is he Puerto Rican?

[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:03.320]
Is he hung?

[00:35:03.580 --> 00:35:03.880]
He's what?

[00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:04.920]
Domini Gano.

[00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:06.480]
That's what we had heard before.

[00:35:06.700 --> 00:35:08.980]
So now we got three choices for you.

[00:35:09.180 --> 00:35:10.100]
Which one do you like the best?

[00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:11.020]
Is he from La Rai?

[00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:13.420]
Public Dominican, I like the cigar that I'm smoking right now.

[00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:14.300]
I'm puffin' on one.

[00:35:14.540 --> 00:35:16.380]
Maybe this is an Alex Rodriguez cigar, huh?

[00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:16.840]
What's he puffin'?

[00:35:17.740 --> 00:35:18.560]
Oh, we don't want to know.

[00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:20.440]
Don't ask John Hershbeck.

[00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:21.640]
He might use that word again.

[00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:25.160]
So he's either the Dominican Republican

[00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:28.600]
or a Dominican Democrat or he's Cuban or he's Puerto Rican

[00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:30.120]
and we got to find out if he's circumcised.

[00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:35.180]
We have two open lines in Broward, 5249463524WID.

[00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:36.440]
No ladies again today.

[00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:38.220]
I mean, we really don't care about Monday.

[00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:39.780]
He gave us a real false sense of security.

[00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:41.160]
Like, hey, Ron and Ron are back.

[00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:43.120]
The women are back on board on WID.

[00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:44.680]
I don't hear no ladies now.

[00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:47.200]
No ladies, no way, no how.

[00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:49.400]
They don't care about whether sports channel is going to be on

[00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:50.740]
because they don't care about the Panthers, right?

[00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:52.480]
They certainly don't care about sports at all.

[00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:54.120]
They don't care about Drew Rosenhouse being an asshole.

[00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:55.620]
They don't care about Brian Bladeshoot

[00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:56.820]
and his cousin and the guy being dead.

[00:35:56.980 --> 00:35:58.140]
They don't care about any of this stuff.

[00:35:58.180 --> 00:35:59.140]
And he sure don't watch baseball.

[00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:00.700]
That we know for sure.

[00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:03.420]
Here is the four-letter day on the purple line.

[00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:03.660]
Hello.

[00:36:03.980 --> 00:36:04.840]
Hey, Neon, how you doing?

[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:05.180]
Great.

[00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:08.540]
I'm a little surprised that your staff on this Alamart thing.

[00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:08.840]
Good.

[00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:11.840]
I think it's a little hypocritical

[00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:14.420]
because you're the guy that always says it's just words.

[00:36:14.780 --> 00:36:15.920]
You know, when people get upset at something,

[00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:18.220]
somebody says you always say it's just words.

[00:36:18.220 --> 00:36:18.520]
Yeah.

[00:36:19.100 --> 00:36:20.100]
So it's just how.

[00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:21.940]
Well, yeah, but let's be realistic.

[00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:22.480]
Okay.

[00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:24.260]
And any sporting event especially,

[00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:27.040]
Temporous Flare, people get bent out of shape.

[00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:28.420]
I mean, if you watch a hockey game,

[00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:29.980]
it goes way beyond just words.

[00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:31.380]
I mean, if somebody says something provocative

[00:36:31.380 --> 00:36:33.040]
and rather guy, they drop the gloves

[00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:34.300]
and they beat the snot out of each other.

[00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:35.640]
There's blood all over the ice, okay?

[00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:38.380]
So I think people are getting a little bit carried away

[00:36:38.380 --> 00:36:41.580]
about the fact that when somebody insights you

[00:36:41.580 --> 00:36:44.920]
by saying something really grotesque and whatever it was,

[00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:46.600]
and the guy comes out and continues

[00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:48.220]
and who knows what else was said beyond it.

[00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:50.660]
And he's spitting his face, you know, short of hitting him.

[00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:53.720]
Maybe he was so incensed that the only choice he had

[00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:55.800]
were either to spit in his face or maybe haul off

[00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:58.000]
and slug him, which at that point he'd probably be out of baseball.

[00:37:00.340 --> 00:37:02.240]
Well, in other words, you don't think that ever happens?

[00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:04.960]
Yeah.

[00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:05.920]
Yeah, I'm here.

[00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:08.560]
Yeah, my phone's pretty good for you, that's fine.

[00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:08.780]
Okay.

[00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:10.140]
Can you hear me?

[00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:11.480]
Okay, I have a great day.

[00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:13.760]
Okay, we have an open line and a purple line.

[00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:15.280]
I think maybe I asked him a tough question there.

[00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:17.660]
You know, again, most of it's like 90% of the people

[00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:19.640]
probably come down on the other side, like Gordon Eads

[00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:21.860]
with his emotional column in the sunset with center this morning.

[00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:23.880]
I got news for you Gordon, they've done a lot more

[00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:26.400]
to kill baseball and somebody spit in some of these faces, okay.

[00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:29.880]
They don't care about the fans, and the interesting part

[00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:32.240]
is it's the umpires who threatened to walk out yesterday

[00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:34.340]
in violation of their contract, and now of course,

[00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:35.920]
they had to get their way by at least getting the hearing

[00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:36.740]
moving up till tomorrow.

[00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:39.280]
Now, that's okay, and whatever they decide,

[00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:40.220]
that'll be okay too.

[00:37:41.060 --> 00:37:43.420]
But they got plenty of publicity and plenty of press

[00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:46.420]
and plenty of sympathy and in the meantime the arrows are kicking ice and that's

[00:37:46.420 --> 00:37:47.460]
all i care about at this point

[00:37:48.980 --> 00:37:52.200]
because Roberto alamar happens to be a credit to the game you know the guys

[00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:55.280]
who are the good guys it's interesting they take the crap and people like

[00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:58.940]
albert bell and uh... in sheffield and a few of these and berry bonds who could be

[00:37:58.940 --> 00:37:59.860]
the worst of all of them

[00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:02.460]
uh... life just goes on and it keep collecting the paycheck

[00:38:03.540 --> 00:38:06.780]

[00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:11.900]
and

[00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:14.120]

[00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:17.620]

[00:38:17.620 --> 00:38:18.180]

[00:39:24.580 --> 00:39:28.540]
wondering why my wife won't leave me alone

[00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:32.960]

[00:39:46.540 --> 00:39:51.300]
or i'm just sitting on a bench in del Rey

[00:39:51.300 --> 00:39:55.960]
with my friend kine

[00:39:56.520 --> 00:39:57.860]

this is the last day that we have to work with prehistoric equipment

[00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:21.840]
and here in starting on monday you're gonna hear the difference in the sound

[00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:24.580]
and then a couple of weeks after that when they get the brand new transmitter

[00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:26.180]
and then lashley put out more than 10 watts

[00:40:26.180 --> 00:40:29.900]
then you might actually be able to hear the station without putting a tin candy or your rear

[00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:31.640]

[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.020]
giving him all his publicity and uh...

[00:41:31.020 --> 00:41:32.220]
and telling people all the good stuff

[00:41:32.220 --> 00:41:35.040]
but in the meantime i would like to find out today

[00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:37.100]

[00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:41.300]

[00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:51.260]
like i said before it's not on my cable system yet

[00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:51.600]
yeah

[00:41:52.100 --> 00:41:55.480]
so that's you know i need it because i got the big dish but i mean most people

[00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:58.800]
who got cable would at least like to know if it's going to show up on a cable

[00:41:58.800 --> 00:41:59.200]
system

[00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:02.760]
yet i thought i was looking for because they had a big story on channel

[00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:06.260]
uh... i think it was well was on six last night after the game which i didn't

[00:42:06.260 --> 00:42:08.740]
stay up that late to watch the story but i saw the tease for it

[00:42:08.740 --> 00:42:12.280]
it said thousands of panther fans may wind up in the dark for the opener on

[00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:12.680]
saturday

[00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:15.660]

[00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:16.980]
all right sir

[00:42:16.980 --> 00:42:18.440]

i think that's okay thanks

[00:42:19.660 --> 00:42:23.220]
yeah we're crossing our legs and crossing our eyes and crossing the tees and

[00:42:23.220 --> 00:42:24.640]
dot in the eyes but the hey

[00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:27.900]
i don't know i wish i did know i wish somebody would give us the honest

[00:42:27.900 --> 00:42:28.460]
uh... answer

[00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:30.340]
somebody would give us the amiss on this

[00:42:30.940 --> 00:42:33.080]
like maybe our good close personal friend rimmer

[00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:35.980]
but of course he's probably too busy uh... doing a interroutine

[00:42:35.980 --> 00:42:38.460]
we'd like to get some meaningful information you know i'm saying

[00:42:38.460 --> 00:42:42.100]
and find out if and when since these guys are going to be doing a game on saturday

[00:42:42.100 --> 00:42:45.180]
uh... if for you're going to be able to see it i mean what's the point if you can't

[00:42:45.180 --> 00:42:45.640]
see it

[00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:49.580]
but the great news is that jay randall find out somebody called yesterday

[00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:52.460]
would aspire report from q a m which of course most of their stuff you can't believe

[00:42:52.460 --> 00:42:53.180]
lately anyway

[00:42:53.180 --> 00:42:57.480]
but it's true it's right there in a big headline and since david o'Brien wrote it

[00:42:57.480 --> 00:42:59.220]
you know what that's an incestuous thing

[00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:04.200]
angel and o'Brien to call the tv marlin games next year oh thank god

[00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:07.800]
i'm ready to turn to religion for that i'll tell you that right now

[00:43:08.660 --> 00:43:11.280]
because haven't i said over and over again that if you're going to generate

[00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:14.480]
excitement and team gets some interest especially a town like this that the

[00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:17.520]
quite frankly don't care too much you got to have some great broadcast out

[00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:20.340]
there and jay and gary guess what they're not going to do it

[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:22.580]
here's a mobile in oakland park hello

[00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:26.960]
hey niel yes sir how you doing great i just wanted to confirm that uh... alix

[00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:28.600]
regus is the medic in republic

[00:43:29.620 --> 00:43:33.160]
he uh... went to west mister high school and uh... my amie

[00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:35.980]
yeah did you ever take a shower them or anything i don't know i did i'm not into

[00:43:35.980 --> 00:43:39.420]
that kind of stuff no i mean i'm talking about like in jim class i don't mean like

[00:43:39.420 --> 00:43:42.900]
that kind of a shower no i want to say like a golden shower just like an

[00:43:42.900 --> 00:43:45.540]
ordinary shower yeah no i didn't get into the yeah

[00:43:45.980 --> 00:43:50.020]
i bet you will find somebody who claims to have a shard with them i bet why i don't

[00:43:50.020 --> 00:43:53.220]
we've had we've had guys over the years call a shard with hosea can sucko

[00:43:53.220 --> 00:43:57.660]
oh really who saw a shard with the rocky itch of a rea aka steven borough all

[00:43:57.660 --> 00:44:01.720]
these guys yeah we got the inside dope i can i call someone to do back of course

[00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:06.820]
my kinder okay thanks for the info pal yep so we got a their what do we call him a

[00:44:06.820 --> 00:44:11.580]
Dominican but i thought a Dominican was like a religious sect

[00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:17.460]
you mean like during the offseason he where he wears those smatas we call him father

[00:44:17.460 --> 00:44:24.100]
alix father alix alix god there you go seriously how come this town hasn't

[00:44:24.100 --> 00:44:29.080]
hasn't taken to alix uh... rod regus like even alix for nandes who we love

[00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:32.880]
alix for nandes even though he pitches for the marginal white socks he's a great

[00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:36.160]
kid even always getting chubby in his old age he's terrific we love alix

[00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:40.320]
uh... for nandes and i guess i guess in alix by another name wouldn't just be

[00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:43.320]
treated the same and that's the problem what's the story there

[00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:46.420]
because alix for nandes is one hell of a damn good picture he had a good year

[00:44:46.420 --> 00:44:49.580]
with the white socks and the rumors are that maybe he's coming to the marlin's

[00:44:49.580 --> 00:44:54.460]
next season which would be great but uh... here's alix rod regus a local product

[00:45:01.740 --> 00:45:06.360]
and is light-complexed the and is uh... i mean whatever you want whatever you

[00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:10.180]
like about somebody he's got it you think that those young girls out there and

[00:45:10.180 --> 00:45:13.480]
especially those mighty cones they'd be uh... they'd be wild they'd be having

[00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:17.780]
blow-up dolls over alix a rod especially when they call him a rod oh man

[00:45:18.300 --> 00:45:20.820]

[00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:23.420]

bones but they are the master beaters of percussion

here's the four-letter mail back on a purple line hello

[00:48:06.300 --> 00:48:08.380]
any of your sir uh...

[00:48:08.380 --> 00:48:11.180]
i thought you two minutes ago but my phone died out yeah um

[00:48:12.220 --> 00:48:15.100]
i really didn't get catch what you said but what i was starting to say was for

[00:48:15.100 --> 00:48:16.040]
phone died is that

[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:19.180]
people i don't think people are taking a side of alamar

[00:48:20.180 --> 00:48:23.800]
uh... because of what was said and who said what and what who started what i

[00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:26.620]
think they're just saying it's going it's fitting on an uphired going too far

[00:48:26.620 --> 00:48:29.920]
you you may be an analogy of the uh...

[00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:33.660]
the red wings guy can hit by the mute yeah yeah see that's bad but

[00:48:33.660 --> 00:48:35.260]
he took a cheap shot

[00:48:35.940 --> 00:48:39.660]
and he didn't know the outcome of the he could have killed the guy okay

[00:48:39.660 --> 00:48:43.940]
from behind okay from a blindside he blindsided him he jammed him into the

[00:48:43.940 --> 00:48:47.700]
boards got to stick up in his head and nearly killed a guy and he gets a two

[00:48:47.700 --> 00:48:49.960]
game suspension i know i saw that yeah

[00:48:49.960 --> 00:48:53.660]
number one and you're probably going to jump down a throw for service but he

[00:48:53.660 --> 00:48:55.900]
the guy's not an official for the game number one

[00:48:55.900 --> 00:48:59.020]
now i'm not controlling what the guy did but you know what he is you know what they

[00:48:59.020 --> 00:49:00.740]
both are they're both human beings okay

[00:49:00.740 --> 00:49:03.720]
the game the game is only important to a point

[00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:07.080]
and then beyond that they both happen to be human beings i understand

[00:49:07.080 --> 00:49:11.020]
or jeopardizing somebody's very life as opposed to spitting in somebody's face in

[00:49:11.020 --> 00:49:13.940]
the heat of a disgusting argument or after somebody says something violent

[00:49:13.940 --> 00:49:16.860]
vulgar and insights you to do it i don't see the connection at all

[00:49:16.860 --> 00:49:20.500]
no way saying that you say you you say jeopardizing guys like i don't think that

[00:49:20.500 --> 00:49:24.980]
caught the mute when over there to try to kill the guy i know what i don't think i

[00:49:24.980 --> 00:49:28.260]
don't think cloud let me give the crap okay i don't think he cares about the

[00:49:28.260 --> 00:49:31.900]
consequences called look as far as i'm concerned cloud let me was crazy or in a

[00:49:31.900 --> 00:49:36.400]
bed bug he's not standing piece of crap anyway but yeah i'm not coming to the guys defense

[00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:40.400]
on you know but again we don't know what's in the guys mind we don't know if the guy really wanted

[00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:44.600]
to put that much hurt on the guy but what what what do you mean in other words a guy just to this

[00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:48.660]
is first game the guy's been playing for years he knows what the possibilities are when you're

[00:49:48.660 --> 00:49:52.720]
blindsided guy right up against the way head right up against the top of the boards yeah yeah

[00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:55.980]
i understand so of course he didn't know the outcome but in other words you try to say he

[00:49:55.980 --> 00:50:00.460]
why he wanted to just injure him lightly is that it no no i'm not saying that it all come on give me

[00:50:00.460 --> 00:50:04.700]
a break i'm not saying that at all but my point is with the umpire thing you know you have these

[00:50:04.700 --> 00:50:08.940]
they have rules we have authority in these games you can't once you start spitting on a

[00:50:08.940 --> 00:50:12.460]
so in other words they have authority and they can do whatever the hell they want and they can

[00:50:12.460 --> 00:50:16.580]
call people any name under the sun and they can incite them they can bait them they can stand in

[00:50:16.580 --> 00:50:20.720]
their face and scream and holler and nobody will ever admonish them or do anything to them

[00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:25.740]
but if somebody responds by retaliating then all of a sudden they're bad guys waiting i never say

[00:50:25.880 --> 00:50:29.200]
you're you telling me that there's nobody that the umpires have to answer to

[00:50:29.780 --> 00:50:34.160]
yeah they have to rant answer to richie philips so big deal like he's then they got their union

[00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:38.760]
you think the union isn't gonna back them 99% of the time just like all the umpires now banding

[00:50:38.760 --> 00:50:44.060]
together and threatening to walk out and delaying two games yesterday well no i know i was going

[00:50:44.060 --> 00:50:47.440]
on i saw that and all that was richie philips but still i mean he still has to

[00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:51.020]
does richie philips have to answer somebody even though bud saw his not a commissioner

[00:50:51.020 --> 00:50:56.440]
spot cela gives a clown okay he's he's a nice a non-identity he doesn't even exist he might as well

[00:50:56.440 --> 00:51:02.060]
not even be on the on the face of the planet well he's a living you know because the system is

[00:51:02.060 --> 00:51:05.420]
screwed up with the people that they have in place doesn't mean that the system doesn't work i'm

[00:51:05.420 --> 00:51:09.140]
i'm just amazed that people who don't even like like the first guy had call on this this morning

[00:51:09.140 --> 00:51:13.640]
doesn't follow baseball doesn't pay any attention to it like most people no but wait a minute

[00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:17.800]
but i'm amazed that everybody is jumping on the bandwagon because somebody's spitting somebody's face

[00:51:17.800 --> 00:51:21.280]
it's not jumping on the bandwagon we have people that murder people every and the thing with

[00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:26.040]
abe hersfeld to bring that up as a comparison uh there wasn't in the middle of some kind of a

[00:51:26.040 --> 00:51:29.660]
heated event abe hersfeld spitting the guy's face because he asked him a question he didn't like

[00:51:29.660 --> 00:51:35.620]
is there some comparison abe hersfeld is a scumbag a common crude scumbag what's the comparison

[00:51:35.620 --> 00:51:38.900]
between him and robert roe allamar well they get him kicked out of the damn uh

[00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:45.440]
get him get him get the herspect kicked out of the uh as a uh uh umpire do some get rid of him

[00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:49.860]
have some sort what he said if he went over the line cross line as an umpire he should have some

[00:51:49.860 --> 00:51:54.560]
punishment but it's not going to happen it's not going to happen but you don't again you're not

[00:51:54.560 --> 00:51:59.520]
listening to me these things aren't done it like like like in a courtroom these things happen in

[00:51:59.520 --> 00:52:03.400]
the middle of a heated argument you're you're you're you're understood understood but yet he

[00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:07.340]
had paid the price for it and i'm going to tell you something he issued an apology that i thought

[00:52:07.340 --> 00:52:12.920]
went way way above and beyond and fifty thousand dollars and the urels kicked in fifty grand and

[00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:17.020]
he uh you know apologize for everything he said and uh what do you want the guy to do you

[00:52:17.020 --> 00:52:21.040]
want to blow his own brains out absolutely not no i'm not i'm not saying what he did was

[00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:26.800]
wrong in a you know when doing it as you know get heated and in responding to what the guy said

[00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:30.520]
i'm not saying what he's just i probably would have done worse okay he's lucky that the guy just

[00:52:30.520 --> 00:52:34.460]
spit in the space i think hersfeld but the point is that you have rules you have to you have to

[00:52:34.460 --> 00:52:39.340]
go by if if what he did was wrong and you know something you know something he got the suspension

[00:52:39.340 --> 00:52:45.220]
he appealed it which is in part of the system players route appeal or uh uh suspensions routinely

[00:52:45.220 --> 00:52:50.940]
just like jockey's appeal suspensions and they they even uh the the league even said okay well we'll

[00:52:50.940 --> 00:52:55.280]
uh to try to pacify you guys will move the hearing up to thursday so he still might miss some of

[00:52:55.280 --> 00:52:58.920]
the playoffs so what's everybody been out of shape about right well it's not a you said you got

[00:52:58.920 --> 00:53:02.880]
to play by the rules that's the rule okay if they will that he's going to have to sit out he'll

[00:53:02.880 --> 00:53:07.180]
have to sit out right absolutely i agree with that ballista let me say this before we we go

[00:53:07.840 --> 00:53:13.440]
first of all what doesn't well already we're going to face but with the this sports channel yeah

[00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:19.600]
that's all you have to do on channel six i believe they said that um tci was the only cable company in

[00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:26.480]
south Florida that is not well as of yet going to pick up uh sports channel yeah every other cable

[00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:30.780]
well how come i'm i got continental how come i'm getting all these reports all these panicky people

[00:53:30.780 --> 00:53:34.620]
out there a delfie is not going to have it and this one's not going to have it uh you know i

[00:53:34.620 --> 00:53:38.220]
i think if people i'm just on you i'm just on your channel six then now they could be wrong but

[00:53:38.220 --> 00:53:43.680]
they said that everybody except tci and the reason why tci uh well this kind of uh um

[00:53:44.080 --> 00:53:48.440]
they're not agreeing to they're not admitting to this but they're saying that uh tci own sunshine

[00:53:48.440 --> 00:53:52.060]
network right i understand that they got a conflict of interest there and they were basically

[00:53:52.060 --> 00:53:55.800]
trying to be hardasses with sports channel right and they're saying well if you want to be on our

[00:53:55.800 --> 00:54:00.460]
system then they'll have to be a premium channel and people have to pay extra for it right well

[00:54:00.460 --> 00:54:04.260]
that's that's what they're saying but you know like he said he said everybody except tci has

[00:54:04.260 --> 00:54:10.060]
taken up so i hope they're right okay pal well find out Saturday you'll have to sit and wait

[00:54:10.060 --> 00:54:13.380]
which is a hell of a way to uh you know plan your life you'll have to sit there and turn it on

[00:54:13.380 --> 00:54:17.540]
seven thirty and find out if the panther flyer game is on and if not uh we're screwed again

[00:54:17.540 --> 00:54:22.740]
well you're screwed because i got the big dish so again all you smart asses out there wow

[00:54:22.740 --> 00:54:26.020]
you would you rather have the big one or the little one would you rather well i've traveled i always

[00:54:26.020 --> 00:54:30.280]
said consistently if you're able if you like living a house if you're able uh to get the

[00:54:30.280 --> 00:54:34.540]
big dish if you can afford it if you will have the land if whatever that's the preferable way to go

[00:54:34.540 --> 00:54:38.820]
and i still believe that and the programming is a lot less expensive and you still get tons of

[00:54:38.820 --> 00:54:44.380]
stuff on your big dish that you will never never ever see on the small dish and the discussion

[00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:49.040]
here's a mobile in Fort Lauderdale hello hello yes sir

[00:54:49.040 --> 00:54:52.820]
a meal first of all a couple things the empires they have a contract too

[00:54:52.820 --> 00:54:57.420]
if one of their empires got suspended if you walk him out if they tried to enforce any sort of

[00:54:57.420 --> 00:55:00.980]
suspension against them right right i'd go and through the hearing and arbitrary you bet man

[00:55:00.980 --> 00:55:05.820]
those guys are tighter than a snare drum secondly remember the good old days when the empires

[00:55:05.820 --> 00:55:09.900]
were just a part of the game some of the great rhubarb that used to happen with any merciless

[00:55:09.900 --> 00:55:15.240]
fields of the road sure they threw everything at the empires dirt spits bottles of water

[00:55:15.240 --> 00:55:21.060]
right whatever happened to those days well you know those days you didn't have like instant replay

[00:55:21.060 --> 00:55:25.520]
first of all because uh you know you didn't have the the mass media frenzy they have now with every

[00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:30.260]
little thing that happens and so they take an incident and they they huh these guys don't want to

[00:55:30.260 --> 00:55:34.780]
be shown up that's their whole thing you can't show me up anymore that's the umperry right and

[00:55:34.780 --> 00:55:38.620]
and like i said the last few years they've started more and more because they're on a power trip

[00:55:38.620 --> 00:55:43.220]
and they've more and more started baiting guys and i wish somebody else out there had knew which

[00:55:43.220 --> 00:55:47.140]
game it was it was either a cub game or it was a no uh maybe it was one of the athletic games i was

[00:55:47.140 --> 00:55:51.280]
watching on satellite a few months ago they're they're they're having an argument umperry makes a

[00:55:51.280 --> 00:55:55.920]
horrendous call on a called baller strike the the batter gets bent out of shape says something

[00:55:55.920 --> 00:56:00.800]
now he gets back into the batter's box i mean the arguments over and the umpire gets out in

[00:56:00.800 --> 00:56:04.320]
front of the plate bends down cleans off the plate with his little brush and then gets up in a

[00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:08.820]
player's face and starts all over again gets him going and throws him out of the game right but

[00:56:08.820 --> 00:56:14.540]
nobody says a word about that absolutely unacceptable i don't know they think now pci sports

[00:56:14.540 --> 00:56:20.180]
channel first of all i have pci i don't think i'm ever going to see the pen for games yeah i hate

[00:56:20.180 --> 00:56:24.960]
pci but also what about the hopes of somebody like wane you know just moving these things from

[00:56:24.960 --> 00:56:29.460]
sunshine without having any agreement with these people you know you're going to run into a stone wall

[00:56:29.460 --> 00:56:35.760]
with pci and uh them on in the sunshine uh cable network yeah now we're screwed well you got to

[00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:41.980]
understand we wane owns wane owns the sports channel but when i predicted it right off the bat

[00:56:41.980 --> 00:56:45.780]
sooner or later and probably sooner everything that uh he's got a finger in is going to wind up

[00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:51.880]
on sports channel i've called the panthers what provisions are they making to have the people who

[00:56:51.880 --> 00:56:56.720]
are not going to be able to see these games have they taken any uh they looking at a local station

[00:56:56.720 --> 00:57:00.420]
to air these games and apparently they're not doing anything so we're going to end we're going to

[00:57:00.420 --> 00:57:04.040]
get screwed with the fight i don't i don't know because they're sure not communicating with me

[00:57:04.800 --> 00:57:08.580]
they're not telling they're not giving me any information mr. hockey puck i'm supposed to be the

[00:57:08.580 --> 00:57:13.560]
guy with all the info and so far they're not the said in any info to me now just want to say goodbye to

[00:57:13.560 --> 00:57:19.840]
jay ran off with his uh one night that switching over to the doctor game um he was interviewing uh

[00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:23.980]
dandry's deals wife yeah and when she left he said i just want to thank

[00:57:24.520 --> 00:57:28.920]
dandry's deals late wife for spending a few minutes with uh adaboy jay he hasn't lost it man

[00:57:28.920 --> 00:57:34.200]
we love him he'll be good out in uh ash tabula somewhere uh have a great day pal good luck to us

[00:57:34.200 --> 00:57:38.200]
yeah i'm still waiting man if there's anybody with a sports channel if there's even anybody that i

[00:57:38.200 --> 00:57:42.600]
know who wants to pass along the accurate information i'd sure be very anxious to do that because you

[00:57:42.740 --> 00:57:47.280]
know that everybody who's into the panthers is listening to this show right now including thousands of

[00:57:47.280 --> 00:57:50.760]
people who are just dying to know are we going to get screwed again are we going to actually get to

[00:57:50.760 --> 00:57:56.260]

[00:58:03.420 --> 00:58:07.060]
i'd like the guy said everything was done at the last minute and everybody's being uh hello

[00:58:07.060 --> 00:58:11.900]

gone long gone okay two open lines on the green lines one eight hundred nine four four here's my

[00:58:16.460 --> 00:58:21.840]
Emmy hello how you doing okay sir heard a sufferlose show at midday on q a m's going to be sponsored by

[00:58:21.840 --> 00:58:26.840]
clear still yeah um he's going to change the complexion of sports radio you know you mentioned about

[00:58:26.840 --> 00:58:31.420]
rumor not getting the job you know in q a m and hang walking off the air yeah you know i listen to

[00:58:31.420 --> 00:58:36.020]
hang manage deep for this all those guys hang mentions manage all the time and manage

[00:58:36.020 --> 00:58:41.500]
mention thank all the time they talk after the game default mention tank big dog mentions the bow

[00:58:41.500 --> 00:58:46.460]
camper is there any reason there's a major click going on here why yeah i mean can't it can't

[00:58:46.460 --> 00:58:51.920]
figure it out they don't want rumor in the circle and why is that i don't know i think maybe the

[00:58:51.920 --> 00:58:56.680]
why because he's a friend of mine no i think you know why because he's on his show all the time well

[00:58:56.680 --> 00:59:00.340]
these are the same guys that want to show the fulfill his contract they're the same guys who

[00:59:00.340 --> 00:59:05.160]
manipulate everything going on in this town when it comes to sports and whatever we talk about i see

[00:59:05.160 --> 00:59:09.280]
your point is an outsider yeah he represents a threat because you know as an outsider and also the

[00:59:09.280 --> 00:59:12.920]
fact he knows something about hockey which none of them know anything about yeah what what is q a m

[00:59:12.920 --> 00:59:16.720]
going to do for hockey coverage i mean what wouldn't wouldn't you think if you're in a position of

[00:59:16.720 --> 00:59:20.260]
being on the year over there and you got a contract and your livelihood is dependent on that

[00:59:20.260 --> 00:59:24.520]
station which has been very very marginal ever since they went all sports wouldn't you think that

[00:59:24.520 --> 00:59:28.900]
you'd want a guy to compliment the people you have on here who knows something about one of the sports

[00:59:28.900 --> 00:59:33.000]
that you carry on your station instead of having to constantly fake your way through and pretend you

[00:59:33.080 --> 00:59:36.880]
know something well they're going to have the coach's show on there i guess on Tuesday Tuesday at

[00:59:36.880 --> 00:59:39.460]
o'clock in the morning who's going to ask the questions they're going to ask the coach if he's

[00:59:39.460 --> 00:59:42.980]
getting late or something probably going to find out you know how i'll be doing how they're doing

[00:59:42.980 --> 00:59:46.320]
with the girls are yes you know because i don't know much about hockey you know i've lived in this

[00:59:46.320 --> 00:59:50.400]
town on my life but i would like to learn i would like to hear somebody educated on the radio

[00:59:50.400 --> 00:59:55.280]
besides your show yeah that you can listen to maybe learn something about it right now he seems

[00:59:55.280 --> 01:00:00.080]
like rumors the only guy in this down if they put Chris moron he can never do a show i mean you

[01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:04.640]
don't like him but you know he's all right yeah yeah from what do i know about hockey you know

[01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:10.380]
announcers so i guess Chris moron the only guy i've ever heard i just think that's why rumors getting

[01:00:10.380 --> 01:00:15.000]
blown out i think he's getting a shaft and on a on a note here i wish dfo would leave your station

[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:19.780]
i wish he would i wish you maybe move somebody else up or bring somebody else in it because he's

[01:00:19.780 --> 01:00:26.280]
what's your thing with dfo he sucks he's just getting so old you know you heard that expression

[01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:31.560]
somebody likes to hear himself talk yeah that's the forest he just goes and goes and just not stop

[01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:36.340]
talk the monologue is just that yeah i tell you what i'll tell you the one thing that dfo i mean he's

[01:00:36.340 --> 01:00:41.080]
a good guy but he's uh he's since he's changed the way he does the show and with these limericks and

[01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:45.080]
puns and all the other stuff i i just don't go for that the thing he does that really frost my ass

[01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:50.380]
my favorite show every week with dfo is Thursday when he's got Dave Hyde and Bob Ruben because they're

[01:00:50.380 --> 01:00:54.760]
great they both you know actually open them up up up up up and say something and he'll take the first

[01:00:54.760 --> 01:00:58.380]
he the guys only keep in mind only got a two hour show and he's got news in there and commercial

[01:00:58.380 --> 01:01:02.780]
so it's really only like an hour and a half so you got an hour and a half to do a show and you kill

[01:01:02.780 --> 01:01:06.640]
the first 18 minutes before you bring these guys out with a monologue i mean well what's the point

[01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:10.680]
why not get right into it baby and and let's hear what these guys have to say right get a difference

[01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:14.860]
of opinion i mean i think that's what makes sports talk you know something you know just talk about

[01:01:14.860 --> 01:01:19.720]
hangt blows off anybody that doesn't agree with hangt is gone in two seconds yeah it's frustrated

[01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:24.300]
it's frustrating but you know something man i don't know what it is about him they're lined up like a bunch

[01:01:24.300 --> 01:01:29.000]
of sheep i did they're just one after another after another all look at your line what do you like

[01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:55.180]

i really want every kid who's into anything and his sports at all in this town should have Alex

[01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:07.760]
Rodriguez's a role model well i'm about your age uh i probably enjoy it more than the kids

[01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:16.660]
i tried run and run it's terrible sorry deal you're still god and you always woke up but you don't

[01:06:16.700 --> 01:06:24.100]

[01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:33.100]
guy out there with some baseball cards on Alex Rodriguez and let me say it again like Don

sure it would say all you kids out there you want somebody to look up to here's a kid okay never

[01:06:38.220 --> 01:06:42.640]
stole a freight train doesn't act like some kind of a jerk out there in a field he goes out there

[01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:48.160]
and does the job with his bat with his glove and with his thing and that's it so if you want to follow

[01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:53.620]
if you want to look up to something look up to a rod and then stand up straight and be a man

[01:06:54.620 --> 01:07:00.400]
here's a bokeh hello like i said bokeh hello hello yes sir what's it got man that last guy talking

run and run make rick look like uh i mean crap you know ricks uh i wouldn't forget it i don't

[01:07:07.780 --> 01:07:11.640]
want i want you to say what's on your mind it doesn't get to rick very upset see i want

[01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:15.560]
you to listen rick and suds are going to do great in the afternoon i predicted that and i'm

[01:07:15.560 --> 01:07:19.440]
positive of it they're going to do much better than they did in the morning but i think that rick

[01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:23.640]
needs to understand and i'm sure he realizes this in the back of his mind that they've got like a new

[01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:28.000]
honeymoon period see because when you see the problem i got is i'm where i've always been in other

[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:31.480]
words i don't have to not like i'm leaving or i'm coming back at a different time i'm just here

[01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:35.920]
like i always for a hundred years okay but now they're going in the afternoon so it's like they got

[01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:41.380]
a whole new honeymoon hey welcome back to the afternoon this is number 422 checking back in and this

[01:07:41.380 --> 01:07:45.380]
is going to go on for a few days and then after that it's like uh okay now what do we do now

[01:07:45.380 --> 01:07:50.620]
see what i'm saying i really didn't like run and run that much before but now they're not that

[01:07:50.620 --> 01:07:54.380]
bad actually considering what i heard to pass a couple of years of morning on iod but um no

[01:07:54.380 --> 01:07:59.520]
there let me just say this to and again setting aside what i enjoy or what i like right that show

[01:07:59.520 --> 01:08:03.860]
is going to do great on that i don't drive a retruck either man i'm just telling you run and run

[01:08:03.860 --> 01:08:06.740]
are going to have a big number on this station but i know that rick and suds are going to have a

[01:08:06.740 --> 01:08:10.840]
big number in the afternoon in fact i believe i really do i believe rick and suds will have bigger

[01:08:10.840 --> 01:08:14.280]
numbers in the afternoon and then filled it and i'm not i'm not making a comparison with the

[01:08:14.280 --> 01:08:18.220]
talent because you know why would i do that but i'm just telling you they well i think they will

[01:08:18.220 --> 01:08:23.260]
do better i think that they appeal to a much broader group of uh smerrels out there and uh whatever

[01:08:23.260 --> 01:08:26.980]
they do it will definitely appeal to the intelligence we have down here right there's no question

[01:08:26.980 --> 01:08:30.520]
about that well don't so let me ask you this don't you think that if there's going to be a show that's

[01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:35.280]
on statewide that run and run is the perfect one for that all the same rick and suds too and rick and suds

[01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:40.460]
anyway i got the information on the cable okay i called sports channel because i'm very good

[01:08:40.460 --> 01:08:44.360]
i was very concerned and you want to be yeah and i was and i'm really concerned why they're not

[01:08:44.360 --> 01:08:48.160]
giving me no info it's really pork and my i called i called them directly so here's a scoop

[01:08:48.740 --> 01:08:53.500]
only tci you got to do the only people have to worry about it right and i talked them and they said

[01:08:53.900 --> 01:08:58.780]
every other channel is going to put like a bulletin on the bottom your cable information station

[01:08:58.780 --> 01:09:02.940]
the morning of the Saturday morning yeah right and they're going to tell you what to do and where to

[01:09:02.940 --> 01:09:09.060]
look where to go yeah i mean no problem you but what about the small dish well i i was i almost bought

[01:09:09.060 --> 01:09:13.660]
one i found out they're going to you know keep it out of the but see some people that's why i had to

[01:09:13.660 --> 01:09:17.620]
find out what i'm concerned about though is some people did go out and buy the small dish yeah because

[01:09:17.620 --> 01:09:21.840]
they were told and this is the information i was given that they would definitely be on direct

[01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:26.740]
TV and time for the opening of the season and now here we are a couple of days ahead of it and

[01:09:26.740 --> 01:09:30.320]
uh... we're still up in the air so to speak you got to imagine they would be on there though if

[01:09:30.320 --> 01:09:35.680]
it's a problem fly anyone that's the group of the best of interest yeah so and everyone else would

[01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:38.920]
be psychotic i hope you're right yeah i wouldn't worry about it okay pal

[01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:43.000]

[01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:23.320]
Monday that was just uh... that was an aberration that will never happen again so i just say screw the

[01:12:23.320 --> 01:12:28.160]
women and most of the people in george is not in this head right now most of the people saying all right

[01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:33.320]
so just groom here's a parkland hello and ill yes sir

[01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:36.000]
is my problem with the reberto alamar situation yes

[01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:41.600]
players managers and umpires have been screaming at the center of each other and arguing for the last

[01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:46.040]
hundred and twenty five years and squirting tobacco choose these others face you know they uh... they

[01:12:46.040 --> 01:12:51.000]
scream the c sucker word and the mother effort word left or right right i mean they umpires here

[01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:55.380]
from the players and managers all the time yeah what happened first of all was a terrible call the

[01:12:55.380 --> 01:12:59.580]
pictures way outside right walk to the dugout apparently with some more stuff said from the dugout

[01:13:00.040 --> 01:13:04.040]
and then the umpire turned around and threw them out right now where alamar and johnson came running

[01:13:04.040 --> 01:13:07.620]
out you can read alabar's alamars lips he's like saying for what for what like i'm out of the

[01:13:07.620 --> 01:13:13.200]
right right baby johnson tried to separate the two and he was you know i'm surprised

[01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:18.120]
you have it is skin care fall off his body and he couldn't be very effective but i'm saying that if

[01:13:18.120 --> 01:13:22.280]
if her spec who by the way i don't know that much about him i don't he doesn't have a reputation

[01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:27.620]
like that pain in the ass joe west or uh angel her nandas joe west angel her nandas got andrei

[01:13:27.620 --> 01:13:32.400]
dot in thoughts out of a game this year right i remember that these guys are baiting umpires all right

[01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:37.620]
her spec i don't know that he is so i'm saying if he said something that derogatory to alamari

[01:13:37.620 --> 01:13:42.320]
whether it be a racist comment or you know anything really that bad johnson was right there don't

[01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:46.620]
you think john should be jumping up and down screaming in defense of alamar that you know he was

[01:13:46.620 --> 01:13:51.320]
justified and spitting in this guy's face i mean i don't know that i've ever seen any umpire any

[01:13:51.320 --> 01:13:56.580]
manager a player spitting a face before yeah and if he supposedly did say something that derogatory

[01:13:56.580 --> 01:14:00.400]
to bait him johnson certainly would have heard it because he was right there yeah and i haven't

[01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:04.840]
heard him react at all as far as in defense of alamar you know saying that he was justified in spitting

[01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:09.980]
so he's not going to say he was justified in spitting he's not going to say that he can't do that

[01:14:09.980 --> 01:14:14.020]
and and i'm not saying he was justified i never said that right i'm saying that they were both

[01:14:14.020 --> 01:14:19.760]
wrong and that the thing with the umpires precipitating these uh these things is not acceptable

[01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:23.800]
yeah they're they had these guys have to be unequal footing i mean the umpires got to be in

[01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:27.500]
control to a point but the players also have to have some recourse if the umpires are going to

[01:14:27.500 --> 01:14:31.780]
you know keep taunting them and baiting them right and like i told the other guy you know in a hockey

[01:14:31.780 --> 01:14:37.860]
game once the last time you're somebody complain that somebody spitting their face now i i'll agree

[01:14:37.860 --> 01:14:44.020]
with that i just don't i mean umpires again have baited players before um i mean if he i've never

[01:14:44.020 --> 01:14:48.440]
again i've never seen anybody spitting an umpires face before no i haven't either but but let me

[01:14:48.440 --> 01:14:52.960]
let me ask you something like Zimmer and uh in the old days Eddie stanky and derogia and all these

[01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:56.820]
guys a lot of me used to choke to tobacco right don't you think that these guys were like put you

[01:14:56.820 --> 01:15:01.820]
know spurtin like tobacco juice i mean the screaming and yelling uh i did this thing about i think

[01:15:01.820 --> 01:15:07.200]
the most interesting thing about this whole thing is the way that people interpret spitting in some

[01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:12.620]
a man spitting in another man's face and to me i mean you know maybe because i look at it from a

[01:15:12.620 --> 01:15:17.580]
different perspective but uh you know is that the end of the world that's pretty disgusting though

[01:15:17.580 --> 01:15:21.860]
you know it just it's just nasty i mean that's what rucker hower said you know i don't have anybody

[01:15:21.860 --> 01:15:26.600]
spitting in your face obviously that's what rucker hower said at the end of the hitter and unfortunately

[01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:29.980]
it happened just you know the thing is if this was still a regular season if you were midway

[01:15:29.980 --> 01:15:33.740]
through the season maybe almar would be sat down for ten or twelve games right that would be

[01:15:33.740 --> 01:15:37.540]
it but because you know if he's stupid enough to do this on the eve of his team making the playoffs

[01:15:38.060 --> 01:15:42.100]
and his suspensions are going to affect now so in other words you think that in the in the middle of

[01:15:42.100 --> 01:15:46.140]
a heated argument like that somebody is thinking that clearly that uh well uh we're going into the

[01:15:46.140 --> 01:15:50.720]
playoffs that better not do i mean it i mean it obviously happened just spontaneously he lost it i

[01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:54.640]
mean he just went ballistic for whatever reason which doesn't make it right but it also doesn't

[01:15:54.640 --> 01:15:58.940]
make right whatever precipitated it well didn't he rose get forty games several years back with the

[01:15:58.940 --> 01:16:03.500]
date balloon that he pushed yeah okay and oh yeah and in pologne's book he'll he goes on

[01:16:03.500 --> 01:16:09.140]
and tells you how i mean he really uh he came down on rose i mean if rose was safe by five feet

[01:16:09.140 --> 01:16:13.720]
he was out right he would tell you a lot about the sun of a bitch umpires that were out there

[01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:18.000]
that's right uh so again the young pirates are not blamed but i think this just this is this is

[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:22.720]
so this is the first time and i i think it's pretty disgusting but uh you know if we can debate it

[01:16:22.720 --> 01:16:26.960]
in our area just say goodbye to j randolph that's all i say and a couple of points concerning that

[01:16:26.960 --> 01:16:33.740]
yes uh Joe angel he's okay the thing that bothers me is he'll be he'll be broadcasting the game be

[01:16:33.740 --> 01:16:38.640]
speaking perfect unbroken english and then you know there's a ground ball to areas those over

[01:16:38.640 --> 01:16:43.420]
the first of covenees out that brings up a lot better for a lot better yeah well he he tried

[01:16:43.420 --> 01:16:48.220]
i think that's part of the stick again and that's the thing i don't like about you i i still say he's

[01:16:48.220 --> 01:16:52.440]
the most frustrating broadcasts i've ever heard because he could be great but he wants to be john

[01:16:52.440 --> 01:16:57.400]
Miller he wants to be a comedian he's a john Miller clone yeah and the effective tone in his voice

[01:16:57.400 --> 01:17:02.280]
right marlin's when say you know i i just i don't i'm not into fake excitement i've been listening

[01:17:02.280 --> 01:17:07.200]
to baseball for forty some years now and i never remember any announcer's doing fake excitement i

[01:17:07.320 --> 01:17:10.840]
either it's exciting or it's not there's a lot to be said for fake excitement sometimes

[01:17:10.840 --> 01:17:15.540]
yeah but not a ball game and closing yes page three a in the sun setting i'm sure you have it

[01:17:15.540 --> 01:17:20.400]

[01:18:09.340 --> 01:18:14.620]
about you for the last half hour yeah so i'm talking about you i've been wondering inquiring

[01:18:14.620 --> 01:18:19.420]
minds would like to know yeah about this sports channel business and there are a lot of people

[01:18:19.420 --> 01:18:23.660]
getting real nervous now i did have a call a couple of minutes ago from a guy who called sports

[01:18:23.660 --> 01:18:27.620]
channel i remember you introduced me at the game to the guy from sports channel vice president

[01:18:27.620 --> 01:18:31.820]
general manager rich Bradley right and he he said he loves me and he appreciates all the publicity

[01:18:31.820 --> 01:18:36.340]
i've given them in the games being on sports and well that's great but at the same time you know i would

[01:18:36.340 --> 01:18:40.860]
see unlike some people in this business i'm a credibility is important to me if i'm ever going to

[01:18:40.860 --> 01:18:45.460]
like having income credibility is important so i don't like coming on here and giving out information

[01:18:45.460 --> 01:18:49.560]
and then find you that well maybe it's true and maybe it's not so i'm trying to get the story behind

[01:18:49.560 --> 01:18:54.440]
the story is when saturday comes where is this sports channel going to be and who's going to get

[01:18:54.440 --> 01:18:58.460]
it mullio as i said the last time i was in your studio that uh... continental

[01:18:58.460 --> 01:19:03.960]
but delphi comcast and jones will all be on the system

[01:19:05.020 --> 01:19:10.460]
by saturday right after rich Bradley this morning and by the way uh... have george check the

[01:19:10.460 --> 01:19:16.200]
fax machine he is faxing over a letter that was written by an attorney that deals with his whole t

[01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:18.420]
c i s sports channel situation

[01:19:19.100 --> 01:19:22.400]
but anyway i already got that i got a copy of it okay got already that quick

[01:19:22.400 --> 01:19:26.740]
that quick no yes today i got it from somebody else okay so tom thanks but i'm way ahead of

[01:19:26.740 --> 01:19:31.620]
all right well anyway uh... rich Bradley tells me this morning that uh... all

[01:19:32.340 --> 01:19:38.020]
for those systems and four or five overall here in south florida will be up and operating one of

[01:19:38.020 --> 01:19:43.360]
the systems uh... has already uh... started carrying sports channel and i don't know which one of

[01:19:43.360 --> 01:19:45.620]
the four it is but they'll all be up by midnight

[01:19:46.620 --> 01:19:52.300]
friday or saturday morning right and uh... as far as direct tv is concerned and i and i

[01:19:52.300 --> 01:19:55.280]
christm on that this morning as well he's very optimistic

[01:19:55.800 --> 01:20:00.000]
that there'll be a deal with direct t v now the problem is in you know better than

[01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:03.260]
anybody is they've got to find a channel for sports channel

[01:20:03.820 --> 01:20:08.840]
so the direct t v people are working on it right now and the hope is they will

[01:20:08.840 --> 01:20:13.520]
have it up by saturday but uh... there is a a chance they won't be able to get that

[01:20:13.520 --> 01:20:17.800]
done by saturday but it might be early next week before sports channels on direct

[01:20:18.520 --> 01:20:22.980]
but the bottom line is that uh... everybody will be on board except for t c i

[01:20:22.980 --> 01:20:23.560]
yeah

[01:20:24.780 --> 01:20:29.660]
so t c i is uh... doing the job well i mean uh... i think everybody knows and you've

[01:20:29.660 --> 01:20:33.100]
talked about it at length here over the last several weeks and that is that t c i

[01:20:33.100 --> 01:20:38.920]
is a majority owner of uh... sunshine network they also manage the network and uh...

[01:20:38.920 --> 01:20:42.520]
what they're doing basically is punishing uh... the sports fans here in south florida

[01:20:42.520 --> 01:20:46.720]
and uh... not punishing uh... sports channel which i guess is the attempt here but

[01:20:46.720 --> 01:20:48.880]
they're really punishing uh... their own

[01:20:48.880 --> 01:20:50.440]
customers and consumers

[01:20:51.520 --> 01:20:53.400]
okay so anything else new rimmer

[01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.240]
anything else new yeah not to my knowledge

[01:20:56.880 --> 01:21:00.180]
yeah not to my knowledge giving you that opportunity i'm giving you that window

[01:21:00.180 --> 01:21:04.400]
of opportunity now to uh... lay on us anything you'd like well i uh... i think i've

[01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:05.380]
got to do it face-to-face

[01:21:07.140 --> 01:21:11.660]
face-to-face with who what do you later on later on this week uh... well we're

[01:21:11.660 --> 01:21:13.300]
pretty good idea what's going on yeah

[01:21:13.980 --> 01:21:17.840]
and uh... which what what does that mean i'll be in a better position to uh...

[01:21:17.840 --> 01:21:19.120]
and be more prepared to talk

[01:21:20.160 --> 01:21:23.400]
you know what i'm talking about yeah yeah

[01:21:23.400 --> 01:21:27.840]
yeah so limba saw that we do know that limbaugh starts monday on wionc we do know that

[01:21:27.840 --> 01:21:31.740]
yeah i uh... i heard that this morning listening to your show right on my way here

[01:21:31.740 --> 01:21:33.780]
to the right it's in the heralds so must be true

[01:21:33.780 --> 01:21:37.220]
and it wasn't written by bary jackson so there's a chance it might be accurate and

[01:21:37.220 --> 01:21:39.540]
wasn't fed by somebody that's trying to misinform him

[01:21:39.540 --> 01:21:42.860]
well i don't know what uh... what the story is there but uh...

[01:21:42.860 --> 01:21:46.840]
yeah uh... all i can say at this point and rase shepard out for one to three

[01:21:46.840 --> 01:21:50.020]
weeks with a separated shoulder which uh... really upset to your about that

[01:21:50.020 --> 01:21:55.540]
well not as upset as dog mcclean is uh... i mean after all the panthers open up

[01:21:55.540 --> 01:21:58.940]
Saturday here and they're looking to increase the scoring from last year and

[01:21:58.940 --> 01:22:02.060]
starting the season with rase shepard but he was hurt and hamilton last week and

[01:22:02.060 --> 01:22:05.840]
it's really a case of how much pain rake and play with if you remember in the

[01:22:05.840 --> 01:22:09.800]
playoffs he separated his other shoulder and was expected to miss two or three

[01:22:09.800 --> 01:22:13.420]
weeks and was back in a couple of games and that's all the pain threshold thing

[01:22:13.420 --> 01:22:16.980]
with rase he was here early on this morning getting treatment and uh... he

[01:22:16.980 --> 01:22:21.120]
wants to play as early as possible definitely out this weekend knowing rake i

[01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:24.060]
wouldn't be surprised to him try to make an attempt to play next to the in the

[01:22:24.060 --> 01:22:27.400]
home opener but barring that certainly by the end of next week i heard christ

[01:22:27.400 --> 01:22:31.000]
draper said they wish is not a cloudly would have spittness face instead

[01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:36.600]
yeah i bet yeah i bet and listen uh... if you look at the video i'd love to talk

[01:22:36.600 --> 01:22:40.080]
about my orals yeah if you'd look at the video you can see

[01:22:40.760 --> 01:22:41.860]
the umpire her spec

[01:22:42.360 --> 01:22:45.920]
dating alamar right i mean you could just see it there's obviously some

[01:22:45.920 --> 01:22:49.120]
expletives that went back and forth and you can't read

[01:22:49.880 --> 01:22:54.540]
uh... her spec slips but you get the idea looking at alamar that her spec was

[01:22:54.540 --> 01:22:57.260]
baiting them and as you know i cover the american league for ten years in

[01:22:57.260 --> 01:23:01.720]
ball the more with the orals and i saw on a regular base uh... basis in fact one

[01:23:01.720 --> 01:23:05.760]
of the umpires a shylock who's working that the american championship uh...

[01:23:05.760 --> 01:23:08.440]
series or preliminary series the visual series

[01:23:08.440 --> 01:23:13.420]
a shylock is in ball the more he's one of the worst guys at dating players yeah

[01:23:13.420 --> 01:23:17.520]
and alamar is not and i know reberto alamar very well from covering the

[01:23:17.520 --> 01:23:21.100]
blue jays and the orals in all those years reberto alamar is not a hothead

[01:23:21.100 --> 01:23:25.860]
he's a very low key individual and he just snap now there was some problems

[01:23:25.860 --> 01:23:30.340]
previously with the two but i agree with you wholeheartedly that while the act

[01:23:30.340 --> 01:23:31.380]
was not right

[01:23:31.380 --> 01:23:35.800]
i mean obviously alamar uh... something snap there and something had to be

[01:23:35.800 --> 01:23:36.920]
said between the two

[01:23:37.580 --> 01:23:41.880]
there'll be a hearing obviously uh... later on this week and uh... i would

[01:23:41.880 --> 01:23:45.200]
think that part of the suspension make on later on in the series but will be

[01:23:45.200 --> 01:23:48.480]
a more point of all the more wins again today and like i said cloud let me get

[01:23:48.480 --> 01:23:51.700]

[01:23:51.700 --> 01:23:55.620]
up in arms about reberto alamar i've seen where the way i've seen worse on a

baseball diamond i've seen her a weaver

[01:23:57.180 --> 01:24:00.920]
lose it with umpires before and they get a one or two game of suspension

[01:24:00.920 --> 01:24:04.540]
in the slap on the wrist reberto alamar's a class you play or maybe not

[01:24:04.540 --> 01:24:08.420]
class you know this situation and something should happen but the umpires have

[01:24:08.420 --> 01:24:11.160]
got to be dealt with to you know better than anybody watching all these sports

[01:24:11.160 --> 01:24:14.620]

uh...

[01:27:20.220 --> 01:27:24.240]
uh... far as far as rimmer yeah i like rimmer and everything but it just seems

[01:27:24.240 --> 01:27:28.120]
that the only way the man has a perv of his one of the with you on the show

[01:27:28.120 --> 01:27:31.080]
you need to get the hold your hand for him to get pissed off and

[01:27:31.080 --> 01:27:35.200]
what when did he ever get pissed off on issue i've given him every opportunity i

[01:27:35.200 --> 01:27:36.940]
encourage him to strike back

[01:27:36.940 --> 01:27:40.360]
and jorge has made a good comment during the break the one thing the people in this

[01:27:40.360 --> 01:27:41.560]
market are conditioned to

[01:27:41.560 --> 01:27:45.560]
is people with balls they if they perceive that somebody is like a weasel in

[01:27:45.560 --> 01:27:49.240]
around if they perceive that somebody doesn't have the co-hands to come on in the

[01:27:49.240 --> 01:27:53.280]
tell it like it is or strike back and defend themselves they they don't respect

[01:27:53.280 --> 01:27:56.440]
that they they get very nervous about that they don't like being weasel around

[01:27:56.440 --> 01:28:00.480]
it really does a job i mean he he does a lot of research and he does a job real

[01:28:00.480 --> 01:28:04.220]
good but i mean he just got a stand-up you know i mean the first and go but i mean

[01:28:04.220 --> 01:28:09.020]
a guy a jerk yeah i mean i got to i mean he just screams a lot you know he

[01:28:09.020 --> 01:28:12.520]
thinks he knows a lot i mean he knows some things i mean i think rimmer if he

[01:28:12.520 --> 01:28:15.360]
had the chance he could be the way he researches stuff he could do a lot better

[01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:20.240]
job but i mean he got a butch up man i mean and he i mean he just can't be holding your hand

[01:28:20.240 --> 01:28:24.360]
i told this man that every day when he calls seven eight ten times a day when i'm in

[01:28:24.360 --> 01:28:28.500]
home i've told him that eight million times you got to grow up here you got to butch up you got

[01:28:28.500 --> 01:28:32.200]
to stick up for yourself i can't fight in the whole world's battles for him you know i mean i made

[01:28:32.200 --> 01:28:36.520]
a bad mistake i think yesterday by trying to fight his battle for him i just give him another

[01:28:36.520 --> 01:28:40.840]
opportunity here and well maybe by later in a week they'll start growing he took some of my

[01:28:40.840 --> 01:28:44.880]
medication he's ho he's checking every a few minutes see if there's any fuzz or anything growing
