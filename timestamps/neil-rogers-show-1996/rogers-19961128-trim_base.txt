[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.360]
Talk and entertainment radio.

[00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:06.680]
610 WIOD presents the Neil Rogers ship.

[00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.820]
The jock to deal call 622 WIOD and Dan Scourge board.

[00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.540]
677 WIOD and Broward.

[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.120]
Outside of date of Broward it's toll free 888-949 WIOD.

[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.200]
AT&T wireless and mobile one customers can call for free and poundio.

[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:22.160]
Roar now.

[00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:23.800]
The Neil Rogers ship.

[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.100]
Holy cow!

[00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:33.720]
Well that game was worth it spotting Neil Rogers on Hollywood Beach in one of those butt-floss-bending suits.

[00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.080]
That pale Rogers is a like and boy guy.

[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.700]
If you're an atheist with a swish and a stride.

[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:43.080]
Alright.

[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.000]
Smoke a good stove and ride around in a bed.

[00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:47.720]
You've got a radio show.

[00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.480]
You do just for the check.

[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.320]
Happy anniversary to Neil.

[00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:55.600]
Oi!

[00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.160]
The only thing in this town that's real.

[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:02.180]
Roy!

[00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:10.640]
We've all listened for miles around just to hear that famous farting sound.

[00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.580]
There are only atkins diet.

[00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.360]
Take the bread off your sandwich.

[00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.400]
And like baking bonuses to merry-manders.

[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.060]
Alright.

[00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.500]
Neil Rogers you're the best.

[00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:24.600]
You've hurt.

[00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.960]
Really put my hand me to the test.

[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:38.020]
Neil Rogers always gets to know you're there.

[00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.780]
Okay.

[00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.120]
Neil Rogers, you're a brine-cocks and to a bear.

[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.720]
Are you sure?

[00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.860]
Neil Rogers the only thing I miss when I go.

[00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.620]
I went away for a weekend inside a town fart of lowest.

[00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.560]
But happy anniversary to Neil.

[00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.080]
I always love his show.

[00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:06.680]
Got these cigars early in today.

[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:07.140]
Kill y'all.

[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.500]
Happy Thanksgiving.

[00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:10.520]
It's 10-04 at W-Y-O-D.

[00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:11.600]
What am I doing here today?

[00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.060]
Boy was this a bad mistake.

[00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.060]
We've all just analyzed this.

[00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.280]
We've examined it in our minds.

[00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.240]
We've all come to a unanimous conclusion.

[00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.400]
And that is this was a bad idea.

[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.220]
And we're going to come back and do it again tomorrow.

[00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:23.840]
No matter how bad it is today.

[00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.080]
We're just debating here who's going to be working this weekend at W-Y-O-D.

[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.720]
We've decided probably going to shut it down.

[00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.700]
That would probably be best.

[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.600]
Not rather than suffer all an embarrassment that's going to go on when the board ops don't show up the one it already gave notice.

[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.160]
Hey, don't worry about these things.

[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:38.560]
Okay.

[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:39.800]
Because it's a bustman's holiday.

[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.880]
It's all request Thanksgiving today and tomorrow.

[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.040]
And of course it's also we're going to find out who's going to bring us lunch today.

[00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.240]
What do you think we ought to have a Thanksgiving little Joey show up?

[00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.500]
Any only shows up when there's going to be food coming.

[00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.240]
Yeah, don't give me that crap.

[00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.500]
How's your lovely wife doing, by the way?

[00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.100]
Oh, she's sound asleep, huh?

[00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.640]
With who?

[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.420]
So anyway, it's, we'll find out somebody must be open.

[00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:10.180]
That's also what we want to hear besides your painting the S-Request is from people who are working today in places that are open today.

[00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.140]
Is there, is there like any store open today?

[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:13.760]
There's got to be someone.

[00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.040]
Oh, don't give me that crap.

[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.600]
No, there's got to be you know these exploitive bastards.

[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.700]
It's not like the old days when every holiday was like mandatory.

[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.000]
You would close or you'd immediately go to hell or purgatory at the least.

[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:25.100]
Not anymore.

[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.440]
They figure everybody else is going to be closed.

[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:34.600]
Will be open and grab up all the cash because there got to be a lot of pretty bored people that you know how much crap can you eat before the end of the day.

[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.180]
So we'll get right to it because they're in a damn thing going on.

[00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.480]
I see the Leafs got pouted by the Red Wings last night as expected.

[00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:46.020]
There's a great story by the way about Dave Lowry in the Suncentalous Morning.

[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.400]
Dave's crew provides children NHL experience.

[00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.440]
Lowry buys tickets and gives them to these disadvantaged kids.

[00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:53.380]
What a great story.

[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.720]
This is so typical of the guys on the team.

[00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.480]
Not just the way they play the game and the whole deal with that, but just they're like real people.

[00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:03.140]
Nice go and Dave of that great struck a shepherd and Lowry line.

[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:04.620]
By the way, I just thought I mentioned that.

[00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.400]
And then to show you that not everything is so great.

[00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:08.680]
There is a story in here.

[00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.780]
I was sitting here while Ron and Ron were on with the monitor down reading the newspaper.

[00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:14.520]
And like here every day.

[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.680]
And there's that Alan King.

[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:17.440]
He does it for me.

[00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.080]
I don't know about you, but Alan King.

[00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:22.160]
I mean, I'm an old fart and even I don't want to hear Alan King.

[00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:23.940]
But I'd rather hear of...

[00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:24.580]
Don't be fisticed up.

[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:25.440]
That King or Queen.

[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.060]
But man, did you read this story or hear about it?

[00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.700]
Man indicted in death of one year old left in care.

[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.960]
And it's like a little blurb, which most people wouldn't see.

[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.160]
And I hate to appeal on your parade on Thanksgiving day.

[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.440]
But this is so typical.

[00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:39.600]
What is with people?

[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:40.780]
Are they out of their minds?

[00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:49.020]
A grand jury in Broward County on Wednesday indicted a lot of Hill man on a first degree murder charge in the death of a one year old girl left in his care.

[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:57.060]
Everett Dwayne Carter also was charged with sexual battery on a victim under younger than 12 and aggravated child abuse.

[00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:04.760]
Carter 23 told Broward Sheriff's Office detectives that while he was watching Bridget is it or on November 5th, he molested the girl.

[00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.880]
One year old.

[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.100]
When she started bleeding and crying, what a surprise that is.

[00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.540]
Carter said he tried to calm her down by tossing her in the air and catching her.

[00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:14.060]
Oops!

[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.520]
The game ended when Bridget fell hitting her head against the table.

[00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:19.440]
Carter told detectives as in dead.

[00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:24.440]
What kind of...

[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:25.680]
What are we dealing with here?

[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:26.280]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:28.200]
What are we dealing with?

[00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:32.220]
Of course we'd much rather worry about OJ and fry his ass if we could but we never will.

[00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:33.360]
But we'll get all this money anyway.

[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:33.740]
What's left?

[00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:35.500]
But I mean, what is this?

[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.020]
What are we talking about here boys and girls?

[00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:44.960]
I just thought I mentioned that to show you that even though it is Thanksgiving, there's still a bunch of assholes running around on a loose.

[00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:46.900]
Here's the Miami.

[00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.340]
Buenos dias, happy Thanksgiving.

[00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.080]
Happy Thanksgiving, Neil.

[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.460]
And back to you, Turk, I'm Ion.

[00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:52.080]
Whatever you are.

[00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:53.280]
I'm glad you're calm.

[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:54.260]
Glad you're on today.

[00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:54.960]
I'm on.

[00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.180]
You're on right here.

[00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:57.440]
We had tapes this morning.

[00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.000]
We got more tapes this afternoon.

[00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:03.740]
We got tapes up the rectum here at WIOD and I figured we'd better have one live show anyway.

[00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:05.160]
Well I'm glad that you're on.

[00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:09.180]
We are out there and we're glad that you are doing it on the air and that you're on.

[00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:10.400]
What else are you going to be doing?

[00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.780]
Well I'm going to be watching football later.

[00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:14.320]
What time is that first game start?

[00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:15.280]
Not one o'clock I hope.

[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:15.920]
I think noon.

[00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:16.800]
Noon?

[00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:18.340]
Oh no, please say it.

[00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:19.320]
I started early on Thanksgiving.

[00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:21.300]
Oh no, please say you're...

[00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:22.020]
I think it is.

[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:22.620]
You're fun in me.

[00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:24.420]
Well which game is that?

[00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:26.000]
Hopefully that's the Lions game, huh?

[00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:27.020]
It usually is, yeah.

[00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:28.440]
Oh well nobody's going to watch that.

[00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:32.280]
Lions and Kansas City, what a what a what a piece of pus that is.

[00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:36.900]
I mean the big game is when the Redskins are going to pound the ass out of Dallas this afternoon.

[00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:37.620]
We're looking forward to that.

[00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:38.960]
I'm going to watch every second of that.

[00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:43.380]
I'm going to be screaming and jumping up and down for those damn cowgirls to get it.

[00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:44.460]
They will.

[00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:45.100]
Yeah.

[00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:46.160]
They will don't worry.

[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:47.020]
Troy has shown them the way.

[00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:49.380]
They all know how to really take it up the old rectum now.

[00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:52.600]
Well we are going to tell you that the fans are out there.

[00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:53.380]
They're listening to you.

[00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:57.520]
I'm an ex New Yorker and I'm glad that you do a show for us because nobody else would do it.

[00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:58.220]
Okay pal.

[00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:00.280]
I wanted to get one request if I could.

[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:00.820]
Yes sir.

[00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:04.420]
I know you don't like to play it but if you get a chance today would you play a young Neil?

[00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:05.920]
You know something I knew.

[00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:08.580]
As soon as you said I know you don't like to play it.

[00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:09.580]
How did I know?

[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:10.280]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:14.500]
Well as soon as you said that I knew exactly what you were going and...

[00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:20.040]
I'm sorry but I grew up you know two minutes from Yonkers Raceway by the way and old stomping grounds during my heyday.

[00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:22.500]
Where's Bullet Bob Meyer when we need him?

[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:24.040]
He's still here by the way.

[00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:26.380]
You mentioned it a lot because I know you're into harness racing.

[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:30.040]
You mentioned Carmine a lot but you don't mention her Vey Filion that much.

[00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:33.860]
No thanks but they all use a friend Jackie Lee can't be too good.

[00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:38.220]
The two biggest shysters of the day in that period for me when I was growing up and we loved it.

[00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:43.560]
I spent a lot of my misspent youth at the track and even when we were underage they still let us in somehow.

[00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:44.800]
I don't know why but they did.

[00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:47.560]
And don't forget the favorite of all those grease balls Jimmy Maulron.

[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:49.500]
Have a great day pal.

[00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:50.000]
You too.

[00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:50.780]
See ya.

[00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:53.660]
Young Neal, I better write it down because it's not in the DCS.

[00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:57.040]
But it is unfortunately on one of those damn things.

[00:07:57.660 --> 00:07:58.520]
Unfortunately he said.

[00:07:58.840 --> 00:07:59.700]
We'll get to it huh?

[00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:00.420]
It's what?

[00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:01.100]
It's on the nuggets.

[00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:04.360]
Oh geez.

[00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:06.040]
Okay so we'll get to it.

[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:09.820]
We have an open line of day 6222WYOD, Bokopom Beach.

[00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:12.100]
We got two open lines for you and we pay the freight.

[00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:12.800]
How do you like that?

[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:14.560]
One triple 8949WYOD.

[00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:18.500]
In other words it's going to be easy to find is what he's saying and don't make no excuses.

[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.620]
We got no news today by the way.

[00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:27.580]
You don't have to have like coke light and Pepsi light.

[00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:29.020]
This is WYOD light.

[00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:34.020]
Starting as of September 30th this became WYOD light.

[00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:35.740]
In other words we got rid of the excess baggage.

[00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:39.300]
We got rid of contact with the outside world basically.

[00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:41.660]
So we have no news.

[00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:42.660]
We have no board ops.

[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:43.840]
We have no anything.

[00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:47.380]
But we're just here holding up the fort while everybody else is out there diddling around.

[00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:50.040]
But then of course we've always got.

[00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:52.140]
So you know it can't be all bad.

[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:53.960]
Here's Poppano.

[00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:54.460]
Hello.

[00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:55.380]
Hey Neil.

[00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:55.920]
Yes.

[00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:57.720]
Curtis went up for you.

[00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:07.860]
You're listening to Neil Rogers, the only jock and the only individual who's got the guts to do anything on Thanksgiving day.

[00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:09.040]
Yeah that was great.

[00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:10.940]
I'm an Ole Miss Gander.

[00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:13.140]
I used to listen to you way back when.

[00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:18.680]
Yeah you're a Michiganer?

[00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:19.700]
Yeah you're a Keener days.

[00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:21.480]
I never was I'm Keener.

[00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:22.340]
Oh I thought you were.

[00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:23.640]
Yeah right whatever you say.

[00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:27.620]
Well WKNR and I still can't find those jingles by the way.

[00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:29.480]
So just don't pay me on that.

[00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:31.600]
No we got them around here.

[00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:32.300]
Don't panic.

[00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:33.180]
We got them somewhere.

[00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:35.200]
Oh I'm...

[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.100]
Keener's now in Battle Creek and I was listening to him up there when I was up in Michigan.

[00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:42.500]
No that's another WKFR.

[00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:43.120]
They've been there for a while.

[00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:44.700]
No WKNR 1400.

[00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:47.680]
No WKNR is in Cleveland.

[00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:50.680]
I thought they were still up in Battle Creek.

[00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:54.780]
Wrong WKFR they call it Keener but it's used to be owned by the same outfit.

[00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:55.120]
Yeah.

[00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:56.480]
Call letters went to Cleveland.

[00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:58.460]
Don't mess with me with my radio knowledge okay?

[00:09:58.900 --> 00:09:59.140]
Okay.

[00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:03.460]
I may not know much else other than a few hockey players, old time hockey players but I know my radio stuff.

[00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:05.040]
I know my old time call letters.

[00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:06.580]
Yeah well I don't know.

[00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:07.560]
Like WDW IOD Lite.

[00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:10.020]
Yeah IOD Lite and everything else.

[00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:14.180]
Without the news, without the pen and the S information, without contact with the outside world.

[00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:14.500]
Well...

[00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:15.820]
We're just here in this little building.

[00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:16.680]
It's a very nice building.

[00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:17.360]
It's fairly new.

[00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:18.060]
It's clean.

[00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:19.200]
It's fastidious.

[00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:22.320]
And we're just isolated from reality which is probably good.

[00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:23.320]
Yeah it is.

[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:27.460]
You want to be involved with all these stupid stories about these child molesting assholes.

[00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:27.660]
Oh that's...

[00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:29.080]
I say fry their ass right away.

[00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:31.140]
Let's just you know, not waste any time.

[00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:32.340]
That's one sick puppy.

[00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:33.360]
Let's do it on Montel.

[00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:35.580]
Let's just fry this guy's ass and move on with life.

[00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:35.960]
Yeah.

[00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:40.560]
Well in the meantime, you have yourself a very safe and happy Thanksgiving day.

[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:41.720]
Okay you have yourself too.

[00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:42.320]
Keep care.

[00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:45.080]
Okay keep care and take whatever.

[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:46.960]
What the hell language was he's speaking?

[00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:48.960]
We have an open line in day 6229463.

[00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:51.220]
We have one in Broward 767.

[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:53.540]
We're actually getting a ton of calls here today more so than usual.

[00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:54.880]
And that's because everybody's off.

[00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:57.120]
Did anybody call the offer us lunch yet today by the way?

[00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:57.880]
No.

[00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.680]
And by the way, we don't care what supermarkets are open.

[00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:01.520]
This is just like when we first got here.

[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:02.080]
Yes we do.

[00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:02.900]
Why?

[00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:04.920]
They're not going to send us food.

[00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:07.660]
But maybe I would like to know.

[00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:09.600]
Windixie is all four.

[00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:13.780]
Windixie has all these people calling up telling us what Dixie is open to all four?

[00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:15.100]
Telling us what and came art.

[00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:16.260]
What about publics?

[00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:16.740]
They're all closed.

[00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:25.420]
We don't want people calling with what kind of food is what kind of food is came art so open to call us food is game art so see food.

[00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:28.240]
Now seriously, who cares about came art?

[00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:30.260]
That's what they're calling and Walmart.

[00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:31.640]
Well I did ask the question.

[00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:33.980]
When are you so surly about you little miserable spick?

[00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:37.280]
Because all we want to hear from are people who say we're open.

[00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:37.820]
No, no, no, no.

[00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:40.700]
And you're now you're telling all we want to hear from?

[00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:43.180]
I want to hear from anybody who's alive today tomorrow.

[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:45.780]
It'll be a major miracle every line of walking out there.

[00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:48.120]
Oh, so in other words, they're bugging you with it.

[00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:49.380]
Like I said, keep calling.

[00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:51.800]
So anyway, it's 10th, 13th.

[00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:53.000]
Boy, you are really surly.

[00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:56.400]
And you're the one that said you wanted to work today because you wanted the extra pay.

[00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:57.680]
Oh, you said I wanted to work today.

[00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:59.060]
I said that lessons the pain of it.

[00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:00.600]
You didn't say that at all.

[00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:03.740]
If you would have just said it's a bad idea, I'd be sleeping right now.

[00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:06.700]
I would have gotten up a lot later to clean up my little dog.

[00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:08.300]
Yeah, that's a new deal I got now.

[00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:11.000]
Oh yeah, he just all over the house.

[00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:12.060]
Just a little surprise.

[00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:12.860]
He's not too happy.

[00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:14.180]
I went away on vacation for a while.

[00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:16.340]
He had to put up with my mother for about nine days.

[00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:18.840]
And now he's given me a response all over the place.

[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:21.940]
I mean for a dog that weighs 10 pounds.

[00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:25.300]
When you can really your own weight on the floor,

[00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:26.420]
you're doing a hell of a job.

[00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:27.040]
I'll tell you that.

[00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:28.220]
Can you imagine?

[00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:31.220]
Can you imagine if Al Goldstein could have his own weight?

[00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:37.940]
They'd have to have a whole building for him to work in 10-14 at WIOD.

[00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:39.620]
Well, we got a lot of people at a full of crap.

[00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:40.200]
How about if...

[00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:40.440]
Roy!

[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.080]
Could do his own weight.

[00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:43.480]
Man, I think he is.

[00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:45.540]
He's just walking around.

[00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:50.260]
Soon the world will change forever because of 610 WIOD.

[00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:50.760]
Oh!

[00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:53.520]
In Bangladesh, streeter Chins will quote Ron and Ron.

[00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:56.920]
In Marrakesh, political prisoners will salute reconcise.

[00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:58.160]
And it's a Vatican.

[00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:02.320]
All two boys in training will discover the word according to Neil Roderick,

[00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:03.320]
Spell Ron and Ron.

[00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:07.240]
Neil and Rick and Suts, 24 hours a day, live to the world.

[00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:10.020]
Coming soon to computers everywhere.

[00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:15.240]
From Talk and Entertainment Radio, 610 WIOD.

[00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:17.260]
Can beat that gator meat.

[00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:26.240]
Now back to the Neil Rodgers program on 1240 WGBA.

[00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:32.620]
Here again, America's youngest dog show host, 6-year-old Neil Rodgers.

[00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:36.660]
OK, I guess we're done with the mail.

[00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:40.000]
And there's four minutes left in the hour.

[00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:41.640]
Let's take some calls.

[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:42.460]
All in.

[00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:43.120]
Hello.

[00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:44.920]
Yeah, Neil, how's it going?

[00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:46.060]
Great.

[00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:47.520]
That's good.

[00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:52.460]
Well, sir, I can't film my subscription to the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle.

[00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:54.760]
All the good old DNC.

[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.740]
What an abortion that paper is.

[00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.600]
Then I asked how many other people did likewise.

[00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:02.680]
And they said none of my business.

[00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:05.500]
Yeah, well, they're real nice over there.

[00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:08.860]
OK, well, I just thought I'd let you know.

[00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:10.440]
You're a fine American.

[00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:11.800]
Have a nice life.

[00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:12.320]
Hello.

[00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:14.700]
I want to speak to Neil.

[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:16.360]
You got him.

[00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:17.520]
Am I on?

[00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:18.680]
Yeah.

[00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:20.080]
Neil.

[00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:21.360]
Yeah.

[00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:26.360]
Neil, you're a stinky pink old glue sniffing, bed wetter and a pansy.

[00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:28.900]
Big call.

[00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:30.680]
This is the day so far.

[00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:32.400]
Did he say pansy?

[00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:33.740]
I want to sneak it off.

[00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:35.600]
What a mong-brain.

[00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:40.660]
I ride my bike 30 miles every Saturday to the show.

[00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:43.020]
And this guy calls me named.

[00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:44.440]
She's on you, sir.

[00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:46.020]
She's on you.

[00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:51.960]
By the way, have you seen some of those bad boys at the new AMP?

[00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:57.640]
No, what are you cackling about?

[00:14:58.020 --> 00:14:59.800]
Hey, this is my gun.

[00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:04.940]
A million producers in the world.

[00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:08.040]
And they fixed me in here with an egg.

[00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:12.780]
That is my car.

[00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:15.540]
It's a macaque castle.

[00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:16.020]
Hello.

[00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:17.020]
How many?

[00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:20.640]
You're used to be such a nice boy.

[00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:22.640]
And now you're so terrible.

[00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:25.080]
Yeah, but you can't shut it off.

[00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:26.780]
You can't shut it off.

[00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:29.900]
I don't need this.

[00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:33.320]
It offers from other stations.

[00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:38.600]
Patavia, Almira, Fredonia.

[00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:46.500]
But instead, I stay here and entertain you grotesque sub-hoo and dutabag.

[00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:48.560]
Unbelievable.

[00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:50.860]
Geneva, hello.

[00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:52.960]
Hello, is this Neil Rogers?

[00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:55.320]
What kind of phone are you on, sir?

[00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:56.800]
How's that again?

[00:15:57.220 --> 00:15:59.640]
Do you have a dial phone or a watt?

[00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:02.140]
No, I have to put it to the operator.

[00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:06.020]
Let's...

[00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:09.540]
Let's knock into that.

[00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:13.880]
Hey, I was listening to Joey Reynolds on WKBW last night.

[00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:15.180]
Somebody asked you.

[00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:17.700]
Did you hear what he's been saying about you?

[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.460]
No, I don't listen anymore.

[00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:21.660]
He's a daughtering old man.

[00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:23.820]
He claims he's only 40.

[00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:24.900]
Yeah, right.

[00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:27.220]
And do we be true in two?

[00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:30.800]
Oh, shut up.

[00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:32.200]
A group of sub-hoo.

[00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:36.540]
And if you think he's bad now, we totally had you.

[00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:38.420]
Oh, boy.

[00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:43.680]
Okay, when we come back, maybe the egg will come out of his shell.

[00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:45.620]
But I hope not.

[00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:48.120]
Well, it's really something to be thankful for.

[00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:54.920]
I'm even playing at these to Crab, so we must be in a really good mood and we'll be really thankful when Max decides to fix these remote starts and all these things in here.

[00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:57.980]
But hey, Ron wasn't built in the day and of course he's out of the tutelage of...

[00:16:57.980 --> 00:16:58.500]
Roar!

[00:16:58.580 --> 00:16:59.580]
So, don't hold your breath.

[00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:00.940]
Here's Fort Lauderdale.

[00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:01.240]
Hello.

[00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:01.660]
Hey Neil.

[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:02.420]
Yes, sir.

[00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:03.220]
How you doing this morning?

[00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:03.440]
Great.

[00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:04.040]
Good.

[00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:07.580]
Did you watch the Red Wings against the Leap?

[00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:08.440]
That was not.

[00:17:08.580 --> 00:17:08.820]
Was it?

[00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:10.300]
No, I was watching the...

[00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:11.420]
Doesn't the highlights this morning.

[00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:12.500]
I don't want to see it.

[00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:13.260]
I want to hear about it.

[00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:15.680]
Yeah, Brendan Shanahan had the hatchet. Good for him.

[00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:16.000]
Yeah.

[00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:18.940]
I wonder how all the guys' wives on a team field, by the way.

[00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:20.920]
Oh, and also the rumor...

[00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:22.780]
Rumor has it, you know, the Tampa Bay Lightning?

[00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:23.260]
Yeah.

[00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:28.620]
The rumor has it that Phil Espazito's daughter is spreading stories that the Russian guys are hung like a moose.

[00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:29.120]
Oh!

[00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:30.860]
She married that cellophano.

[00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:31.860]
Oh, God.

[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.760]
Yeah, Espazito, whatever, is he?

[00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:34.200]
Hey, really?

[00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:34.740]
He asked me something.

[00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:37.280]
I was listening yesterday, the news.

[00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:38.760]
That one guy who...

[00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:39.800]
Who does the news?

[00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:42.560]
Steve, the guy that is a swallowing problem, yeah.

[00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:44.920]
Yeah, he said, oh, the panther's won.

[00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:47.900]
But the reason they won is because...

[00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:48.300]
Ha-ha.

[00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:49.660]
Ha-shik wasn't in or something.

[00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:49.840]
Yeah.

[00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:51.740]
And then I nailed him later.

[00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:52.920]
It turns out he's from Buffalo.

[00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:53.420]
Oh.

[00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:54.520]
He's a Buffalo hole.

[00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:55.580]
Oh, he needs that.

[00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:56.640]
He needs that.

[00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:57.920]
Yeah, he needs to go back up there.

[00:17:57.980 --> 00:17:58.220]
Uh-huh.

[00:17:58.580 --> 00:17:59.480]
But anyway, uh...

[00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:00.820]
We gotta do something about that news.

[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:01.520]
I'll tell you that.

[00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:05.200]
We got the traffic I've been doing make-believe news trying to be a comedian.

[00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:06.080]
Oh, God.

[00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:08.300]
Give us strength to get through this deal here.

[00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:08.520]
Yeah.

[00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:10.720]
That Steve Nicholis has got an imagination.

[00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:13.780]
Yeah, I have to work today, so I just wanted to wish you.

[00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:14.560]
Doing what? What are you doing?

[00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:15.840]
I'm a...

[00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:16.960]
Porker.

[00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:18.340]
A porker?

[00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:19.280]
Yeah, I'm a porker.

[00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:20.020]
Oh, my.

[00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:24.080]
But anyway, I've been listening here for a while, and I'm a big fan.

[00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:24.540]
Great.

[00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:28.700]
Hey, I'm not a big Rick Riley fan, so if you have it, you could uh...

[00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:30.060]
You could play Rick Riley.

[00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:32.180]
Was that Rick Riley stole my...

[00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:32.600]
Rift Aid?

[00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:34.960]
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

[00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:36.940]
You know, I must be psychic today.

[00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:38.700]
I wish the hell a track was open tonight.

[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:39.120]
Yeah.

[00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:40.480]
I should go immediately not sooner.

[00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:42.580]
As soon as you said Rick Riley, I knew you wanted to hear that.

[00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:43.420]
All right, Neil.

[00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:44.320]
Have a great day, pal.

[00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:44.600]
You're too much.

[00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:45.260]
Go write some tickets.

[00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:45.680]
Okay.

[00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:48.220]
So we got a porker out there listening.

[00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:49.040]
How do you like that?

[00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:50.740]
Rick Riley stole my briefcase.

[00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:51.640]
Where is that, George?

[00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:52.160]
It's in here.

[00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:54.240]
I know, Dan Wellitz in here.

[00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:54.900]
Oh, geez.

[00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:55.600]
This thing.

[00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:59.680]
Like I said, this thing, once upon a time, it was really like useful almost.

[00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:01.860]
Rick Riley stole my briefcase.

[00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:03.680]
Where the hell am I going to find at the stupid...

[00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:05.280]
Oh, look at that.

[00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:09.600]
We also have that Rick Riley Boca-Brion song, too, which we haven't played in a dog's age.

[00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:11.420]
Huh, I might have to dig that out.

[00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:12.980]
Come on, come on.

[00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:13.720]
Let's get with it.

[00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:14.780]
If you lost it or what?

[00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:17.440]
If you lost it totally, I mean, what's Roy going to think about this?

[00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:18.320]
Jesus.

[00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:20.460]
Rick Riley stole my briefcase.

[00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:24.920]
I liked a park in his face.

[00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:28.020]
That's Marmy Tink.

[00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:29.840]
What gives him the right?

[00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:34.240]
Oh, I think his wife, what a fight it off tonight.

[00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:37.580]
Rick Riley stole my briefcase.

[00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:39.500]
What?

[00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:41.600]
This trace to the human race.

[00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:44.620]
Oh, Rick, you're a smuck.

[00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:46.520]
Hey, goat, Bert Sucks.

[00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:50.740]
That wheel of meat should also include Rick Riley's butt.

[00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:51.840]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

[00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:53.940]
Rick Riley stole my briefcase.

[00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:57.820]
I liked a park in his face.

[00:19:57.880 --> 00:19:58.420]
Hey, he's hell.

[00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:00.840]
Rick Riley, you're an asshole.

[00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:03.000]
Did he say asshole?

[00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:03.500]
Yes.

[00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:04.460]
So anyway, he did.

[00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:06.560]
1025 at W-I-O-D.

[00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:08.300]
And it's all request.

[00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:09.220]
Thanks for giving day.

[00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:10.020]
They're all getting ready.

[00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:10.820]
We haven't heard from nobody.

[00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:13.060]
It's going to bring us no Thanksgiving lunch today, huh?

[00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:15.000]
Some nice sliced turkey would be nice.

[00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:17.020]
Or like anything would be nice to be honest with you.

[00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:18.460]
I bet Wayne is open today.

[00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:21.480]
I bet your pony tail is open today.

[00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:23.460]
Huh?

[00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:27.200]
We'll find out who our real friends are out there.

[00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:28.180]
Some of those guys.

[00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:31.040]
I mean, who the hell wants to take a turkey anyway?

[00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:34.280]
There's going to be enough turkey for our goldstein

[00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:35.160]
later on in the day.

[00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:36.960]
Why the hell not have something a little bit more

[00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:37.940]
with a little taste in it?

[00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:39.620]
I've got some ideas.

[00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:40.840]
Here's a Hollywood.

[00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:41.220]
Hello.

[00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:43.040]
Hollywood.

[00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:44.040]
Hello, Neil.

[00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:44.840]
Yes, sir.

[00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:45.580]
I wonder if you could help.

[00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:47.380]
I'm legally blind and I didn't hear.

[00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:50.520]
Could you tell me what time the dollars cowboys are playing

[00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:51.380]
and what channel?

[00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:52.540]
4 p.m.

[00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:53.740]
And of course it would be on Fox.

[00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:54.840]
It'll be on Channel 7.

[00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:55.880]
4 p.m.

[00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:56.560]
Yes, sir.

[00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:57.200]
Channel 7.

[00:20:57.640 --> 00:20:57.920]
Uh-huh.

[00:20:58.060 --> 00:20:58.680]
Thank you, Neil.

[00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:00.240]
Pat Summerall and the John Madden.

[00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:00.940]
Thank you.

[00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:01.320]
Okay.

[00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:03.280]
We have an open line in Brown.

[00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:04.260]
I hope I got that right.

[00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:04.540]
Did I?

[00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:05.000]
Oh, Jesus.

[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.380]
If I gave him the wrong information, I'm going to die and go to hell immediately.

[00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:08.060]
If not sooner.

[00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:09.340]
Boy, do I hope.

[00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:09.980]
Huh?

[00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:10.880]
Come on.

[00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:16.420]
Where's the page this paper today just loaded with crap with kaka as usual.

[00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:17.640]
What's the deal with that?

[00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:19.120]
Where is the NFL page?

[00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:21.460]
We don't give it to him about the University of Huracun's.

[00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:21.680]
Okay.

[00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:22.220]
Screw them.

[00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:26.740]
We know the only big game of the weekend is going to be Saturday as far as college is concerned.

[00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:28.660]
And the Geaters are going to beat the stod out of FSU.

[00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:29.900]
Not that I really care mine you.

[00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:30.400]
I don't care.

[00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:33.120]
I'm not really rooting and tooting for anybody in that game.

[00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:34.320]
I'm more powered to both of them.

[00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:35.360]
But it's going to be ugly.

[00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:37.200]
Where's the, where is this thing?

[00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:38.360]
Where's the stuff?

[00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:39.180]
Where's the meat?

[00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:42.160]
Where's the lamb beef in here in this stupid paper?

[00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:44.300]
Too many pages of ads.

[00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:47.680]
Add after, add after, add for places that ain't even open today.

[00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:48.320]
Okay.

[00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:48.760]
Here we go.

[00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:49.400]
4 p.m.

[00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:52.120]
Like I said, I got to ride Redskins at Cowboys on seven.

[00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:52.960]
It's on schlocks.

[00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:55.360]
Here's a candle on a mobile.

[00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:55.680]
Hello.

[00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:57.720]
What's happening now?

[00:21:58.320 --> 00:21:58.560]
Yeah.

[00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:02.180]
How you doing?

[00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:02.800]
Okay.

[00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:05.060]
Happy Thanksgiving to you.

[00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:05.700]
Uh-huh.

[00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:07.580]
We got a gobbler on here.

[00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:10.240]
Are we a living gobbler?

[00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:11.600]
No, I'm not a gobbler.

[00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:12.340]
I think you are.

[00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:13.080]
You think so?

[00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:14.540]
Well, only sometimes.

[00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:15.100]
But anyway.

[00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:19.280]
Goal Florida State that you mentioned it.

[00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:21.720]
I don't know if it's going to be a rough game,

[00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:23.720]
but I think Florida State State is going to do it.

[00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:26.120]
Can beat that Gator Meat.

[00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:31.460]
That story you read in the, in the newspaper today.

[00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:31.780]
Yeah.

[00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:35.880]
Absolutely, absolutely, absolutely disgusting people like that.

[00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:37.020]
Discuss me.

[00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:38.280]
I have a child of my own.

[00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:40.100]
I have two children actually.

[00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:43.360]
And, and the thought of that, you know, I understand.

[00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:43.920]
One year old.

[00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:45.280]
One year old.

[00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:46.380]
One year old.

[00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:46.840]
I know.

[00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:51.340]
Then the, uh, un, un, unbelievable, unbelievable that gives me chills.

[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:52.480]
Give me chills.

[00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:54.460]
I mean, somebody ought to buy these people a blow up dollar,

[00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:56.880]
something just to try to draw my diaphragm and say this.

[00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:57.400]
You know what?

[00:22:58.760 --> 00:22:59.160]
Mutilated.

[00:22:59.380 --> 00:22:59.620]
Mutilated.

[00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:00.040]
Mutilated them all.

[00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:00.500]
Yeah.

[00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:02.620]
But anyway, in closing.

[00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:04.960]
In closing, have a happy Thanksgiving.

[00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:06.820]
Thank you for being on the air today.

[00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:07.780]
You really made my day.

[00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:11.220]
I was expecting a taper or the turkey parade or something.

[00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:12.780]
Well, believe me, you'll get plenty of tapes.

[00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:14.620]
So we got tapes up the ass here this weekend.

[00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:15.840]
So I love, I love you.

[00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:17.760]
Have a great life, pal.

[00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:18.360]
Take care.

[00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:18.780]
Say goodbye.

[00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:20.620]
Open line on the mobile, pound IOD.

[00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:22.380]
It's 1029 at WIOD.

[00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:24.800]
Talking entertainment radio.

[00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:27.460]
610 WIOD.

[00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:28.720]
Okay, 1033 now.

[00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:32.360]
Yesterday, Scott the long guy who's a wonderful human being.

[00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:34.040]
Believe me, you have no idea how wonderful.

[00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:36.520]
But anyway, so he had given me a tape, a group name,

[00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:38.820]
sublime, and their version of I Smoke a Year,

[00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:39.420]
joint in the morning.

[00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:42.640]
And I think I played about 30 seconds of it and said,

[00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:43.720]
because it really blows.

[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:44.460]
Sorry, Scott.

[00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:48.380]
So little Joey had called the other day and we'll see whether

[00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:50.060]
he's going to come up with a good one or what.

[00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:51.960]
This is who?

[00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:55.000]
The wind jammer is okay as in jammer.

[00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:56.360]
Roar.

[00:23:56.540 --> 00:23:57.220]
Jammer for it.

[00:23:57.220 --> 00:23:58.740]
Me jammer.

[00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:02.960]
I'm pretty weak, buddy.

[00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:22.260]
I smoke two joints in the morning.

[00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:25.300]
I smoke two joints at night.

[00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:29.840]
I smoke two joints in the afternoon.

[00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:32.340]
It makes me feel alright.

[00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:36.980]
I smoke two joints in time of peace.

[00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:39.560]
Two in time of war.

[00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:43.040]
I smoke two joints in class.

[00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:44.100]
I smoke two joints.

[00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:46.600]
Then I smoke two more.

[00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:51.220]
But my mastery was called mission.

[00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:53.900]
If we have fucking man.

[00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:58.380]
My daddy was called mission.

[00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:00.900]
To the best you can.

[00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:01.820]
Well, it's not good enough.

[00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:03.980]
So anyway, Joey, thanks, but it blows.

[00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:06.440]
Okay, I mean, what's wrong with that other one?

[00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:07.440]
How? It's dynamite.

[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:08.980]
Where the hell is it?

[00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:09.900]
I don't hear it.

[00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:11.960]
Do you hear it?

[00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:13.700]
Oh, I don't hear it.

[00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:15.020]
Can I ask you a question?

[00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:16.640]
Who's been in here, pochking around,

[00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:17.980]
weighing with everything on the board?

[00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:21.440]
Every, everything is like configured in a wrong thing,

[00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:23.060]
and it's all screwed up.

[00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:25.380]
Of course, that's your for us, ain't it?

[00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:29.100]
God, I'm in bear act.

[00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:32.520]
Maybe it was roar.

[00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:35.820]
No comparison.

[00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:39.360]
That's what I was kind of like a little stick flutter.

[00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:41.820]
I smoke two joints in the morning.

[00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:44.420]
I smoke two joints at night.

[00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:47.680]
I smoke two joints at night.

[00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:48.320]
I smoke two joints at night.

[00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:50.580]
It makes me feel alright.

[00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:54.760]
I smoke two joints at the time of peace.

[00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:56.900]
And two at the time of war.

[00:25:57.020 --> 00:25:57.500]
All right.

[00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:00.680]
I smoke two joints before I smoke two joints.

[00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:02.840]
And then I smoke two more.

[00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:07.000]
Oh, my daddy was called mission.

[00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:09.480]
You be a hard-working man.

[00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:13.580]
From my mother, she wants to meet you.

[00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:16.300]
To the best you can.

[00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:21.560]
The same one day, I met Emma, came for me instead.

[00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:25.460]
Hard work, good, and hard work, fine.

[00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:27.740]
But first take care of him.

[00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:31.420]
So now I smoke two joints when I get up.

[00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:33.920]
Oh, in the car, I smoke two joints.

[00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:38.040]
I smoke two joints when I play video game.

[00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:41.340]
And at every 10,000 points, I smoke two joints.

[00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:44.420]
I smoke two joints at the time of peace.

[00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:46.400]
And two at the time of war.

[00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:47.120]
I like it.

[00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:50.520]
I smoke two joints before I smoke two joints.

[00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:52.680]
And then I smoke two more.

[00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:21.980]
Oh, my daddy was called mission.

[00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:24.320]
You be a hard-working man.

[00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:28.520]
From my mother, she wants to meet you.

[00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:30.320]
To the best you can.

[00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:36.500]
The same one day, I met Emma, came for me instead.

[00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:40.600]
Hard work, good, and hard work, fine.

[00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:42.880]
But first take care of him.

[00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:46.380]
That's why I smoke two joints in the morning.

[00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:49.000]
I smoke two joints at night.

[00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:52.780]
I smoke two joints in the afternoon.

[00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:55.140]
It makes me feel alright.

[00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:59.440]
I smoke two joints at the time of peace.

[00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:01.560]
And two at the time of war.

[00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:05.460]
I smoke two joints before I smoke two joints.

[00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:07.700]
And then I smoke two more.

[00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:09.680]
Oh, two joints.

[00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:10.700]
That's what I do.

[00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:15.920]
Oh, two joints.

[00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:19.520]
Come and smoke two joints with me in the morning.

[00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:22.220]
Oh, two joints.

[00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:25.680]
Come and smoke two joints with me in the afternoon.

[00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:26.540]
Yeah.

[00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:28.460]
Oh, two joints.

[00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:32.180]
Hey, would you rather smoke two joints or would you rather do your homework?

[00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:32.360]
Oh, two joints.

[00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:36.220]
I know you weren't going to say that.

[00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:41.200]
Oh, two joints.

[00:28:42.060 --> 00:28:45.180]
Oh, two joints.

[00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:47.280]
Oh, two joints.

[00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:48.280]
That's what I do.

[00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:53.460]
Oh, two joints.

[00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:58.640]
But anyway, so it's 1038 W.I.O.D.,

[00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:00.960]
that's the definitive virgin, make no mistake about it.

[00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:04.220]
It may not have been the original, but sometimes the imitator be the best, right?

[00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:06.520]
That's what Paul Castanova always says.

[00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:08.100]
Here's a pig report in Miami.

[00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:08.720]
Hello.

[00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:09.660]
Hey, Neil.

[00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:10.240]
Yes, sir.

[00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:10.840]
Happy Thanksgiving.

[00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:11.640]
Back to you.

[00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:12.500]
They're out in force.

[00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:13.100]
I think.

[00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:13.580]
Oh, no.

[00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:15.900]
I just had a poker call a little while ago.

[00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:17.320]
He seemed like a real benevolent guy.

[00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:19.120]
That wouldn't write you a ticket for more than 500 bucks.

[00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:19.580]
That's right.

[00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:20.160]
I heard him.

[00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:20.640]
I heard him.

[00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:20.800]
Yeah.

[00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:26.120]
They decided to give the criminals a break today.

[00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:26.640]
Yeah.

[00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:29.960]
Well, we got a real short of your money.

[00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:32.860]
We're going to go to Calroyo now, and we can get the city of Miami out of Hock.

[00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:33.920]
They got a fill in there.

[00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:34.580]
There's a short.

[00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:34.780]
There's a short.

[00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:35.480]
Yeah.

[00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:37.480]
Where now, where is it?

[00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:43.460]
8.74, as you get off of the 88th, you know, a candle drive turn off there.

[00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:45.320]
I wouldn't go over 20.

[00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:46.280]
Just don't get off.

[00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:47.200]
Yeah, don't get off.

[00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:47.640]
Keep going.

[00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:48.080]
OK.

[00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:50.120]
All right, Neil.

[00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:50.700]
Have a good one.

[00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:51.380]
Thanks for the warning.

[00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:51.840]
All right.

[00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:52.220]
See you.

[00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:53.020]
Thanks for being on the air.

[00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:53.380]
OK.

[00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:59.420]
Yeah, the audience is very grateful that there's one live show that somebody, some hot shot, decided to come into the hands of these stupid tapes.

[00:29:59.420 --> 00:30:04.620]
And a lot of stupid part timers going to literally like that on the air just filling in the gaps.

[00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:05.360]
That's a bunch of crap.

[00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:08.260]
I wouldn't be surprised if we even show up on Christmas New Year, but we won't.

[00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:09.700]
We won't.

[00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:11.700]
Those are Mondays too, by the way, this year.

[00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:12.260]
Hallelujah.

[00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:13.220]
Yeah.

[00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:15.940]
It's a real piece of crap when those days turn what?

[00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:16.340]
They're not.

[00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:18.060]
What day is it on?

[00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:25.640]
Well, I hate to break the news to you, but if it's Wednesday, then somebody's got this all screwed up because it says,

[00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:26.960]
Oh, you know what?

[00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:28.920]
Oh my God.

[00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:29.460]
Tracy.

[00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:30.820]
I thought Tracy was perfect.

[00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:32.320]
You have an old copy.

[00:30:32.420 --> 00:30:33.140]
He gave us the corrected.

[00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:35.700]
Oh, he's got Saturday, December 23rd.

[00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:36.360]
We're doing a thing.

[00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:38.700]
And it's 21st.

[00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:39.000]
Yes.

[00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:42.340]
The Saturday before Christmas, because I was just, so that's even better.

[00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:43.340]
That's even better.

[00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:45.520]
Now it's not really even better, because then where the hell can you go?

[00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:47.180]
We're moving.

[00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:49.740]
We're moving Christmas day to Monday this year, whether you like it or not.

[00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:50.300]
How do you like that?

[00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:51.620]
We won a long holiday weekend.

[00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:53.040]
What kind of crap in a Wednesday?

[00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:54.800]
Which breaks up your whole week?

[00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:55.660]
That blows.

[00:30:56.260 --> 00:30:56.980]
That sucks.

[00:30:57.740 --> 00:31:02.600]
What kind of crap is that that you decided to get born out of day like that in the middle of the week?

[00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:05.840]
Doesn't he know you're supposed to get born on either a Friday or a Monday?

[00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:10.560]
So we have a long bus mentality vacation weekend and you can go to Rome again and see all the get's keys over there to Vatican.

[00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:18.440]
How can a Chinatown crawling around in their little schmattas and throwing their last few lira to the Pope so we can go out and rent some or alter boys?

[00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:20.720]
Here's North Miami Beach.

[00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:21.020]
Hello.

[00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:23.020]
Cool, Neil. Good morning.

[00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:23.500]
Yes, sir.

[00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:24.200]
How are you this morning?

[00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:27.840]
I'm a little amiff now that I find that Christmas and New Year's are on a Wednesday.

[00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:29.580]
Yeah, just when you said Monday, I looked at my camera.

[00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:33.540]
Well, the only reason I figured that because I'm looking at this schedule here.

[00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:35.420]
It says Saturday, December 23rd.

[00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:38.540]
We're doing an appearance, but it turns out to be the 21st.

[00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:39.840]
You need to beat your promotions manager.

[00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:40.280]
Yeah.

[00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:41.720]
I am.

[00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:43.760]
We're close today, but I'm actually working.

[00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:44.400]
Doing what?

[00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:46.440]
We have a beeper in a cell phone company.

[00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:46.880]
Yeah.

[00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:51.140]
And it's the only day that the phones don't ring off the hook that we can get any kind of real work going on.

[00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:51.400]
Great.

[00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:52.860]
So, uh...

[00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:54.780]
The only day here for me, the phones are ringing off the hook.

[00:31:54.820 --> 00:31:55.640]
It's a beautiful thing.

[00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:56.420]
I guess that's good.

[00:31:56.620 --> 00:31:57.860]
Well, because everybody, I figured it.

[00:31:57.920 --> 00:31:59.700]
Usually, I'm Thanksgiving on the major holidays.

[00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:01.940]
It's like this because they got some time. They got no excuses.

[00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:03.660]
Yeah, they got nothing.

[00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:05.200]
The rest of the week, they're very busy.

[00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:06.500]
They're very especially the women.

[00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:08.160]
They call when they finally get one on here.

[00:32:08.180 --> 00:32:10.980]
She hangs on for like 15 seconds and then, oh, she's too important.

[00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:12.060]
She's got to go finish her nails.

[00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:13.180]
She's got to finish her shopping.

[00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:13.560]
Right.

[00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:15.440]
Well, tell all your listeners to get stuffed.

[00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:16.100]
Okay.

[00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:17.020]
Have a great day.

[00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:23.020]
Yeah, I think somebody said this morning, the early game is 1230, but I think that might be the pregame.

[00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:24.880]
I think it probably kicks off at one, but who cares?

[00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:29.740]
Well, yeah, Detroit and Kansas City, I mean, you got to be psychotic to watch that.

[00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:31.440]
That's two losers going head to head.

[00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:33.860]
Unless you like seeing Wayne Fonts and other fat guys.

[00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:35.180]
Have a great day, Pat.

[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:35.720]
Hi, Uncle Leo.

[00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:35.960]
Yeah.

[00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:39.580]
By the way, Wayne Fonts is out. He's going to be long gone. He's going to be dead meat.

[00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:43.840]
We have an open line in date, 622-2946-36222.

[00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:45.820]
It's almost like we're giving crap away today.

[00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:48.200]
Well, we are. We're here. That's our present to you.

[00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:50.180]
So who called you about the food, by the way?

[00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:50.720]
Nobody.

[00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:52.820]
Hey, but camearts open.

[00:32:56.720 --> 00:33:01.440]
Well, nobody called and said we would love to bring you food for lunch today with little Joey there.

[00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:02.640]
And we know you guys are starving.

[00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:06.520]
And you're entertaining us on Thanksgiving Day and came into work, which nobody else is doing.

[00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:08.180]
And the whole damn station is tapes.

[00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:11.640]
Nobody called and said we would love to bring you a bunch of crap.

[00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:14.320]
Come on, bring us a bunch of crap, will you?

[00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:18.160]
Even Ponytail didn't call.

[00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:21.140]
Who ordinarily is like who was here just the other day.

[00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:23.980]
Oh, I guess he already did his duty by stopping by Wayne Arnold's.

[00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:26.440]
God forbid that he should bring us by something really good.

[00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:28.420]
Here's the West Palm Beach. Hello.

[00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:30.060]
Hey, good morning, Neil.

[00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:30.520]
Yes, sir.

[00:33:30.820 --> 00:33:31.640]
Hey, how you doing?

[00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:32.120]
Great.

[00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:36.300]
Thank you for performing a community service today and being there.

[00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:36.940]
Yes, I am.

[00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:37.780]
Giving all of us a choice.

[00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:40.060]
I think this should be the headline in both newspapers today.

[00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:43.520]
Roger's works on Thanksgiving, giving us something to be thankful for.

[00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:44.040]
Exactly.

[00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:46.320]
Everybody's going to be yanking on the old swishbone today.

[00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:50.900]
And I don't want to change the pace of the show, but I didn't have a radio accident last week.

[00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:51.700]
I had a disaster.

[00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:55.400]
Orchley, heading for the bar, like pop on the radio.

[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:56.820]
You're not going to believe.

[00:33:57.420 --> 00:33:58.140]
I don't believe it.

[00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:00.020]
Gilbert was talking to Dickie Farco.

[00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:01.880]
Some West Palm Beach station.

[00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:05.180]
Oh, boy. Well, at least he found his own level now.

[00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:06.800]
He found a perfect spot to land.

[00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:08.300]
So I turned it off, right?

[00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:12.880]
When it's a bar left at three, turn a radio on it's still in the same station.

[00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:14.840]
I'm not kidding you.

[00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:19.380]
Joey Reynolds on some kind of how to improve your life talk show.

[00:34:19.660 --> 00:34:20.860]
How to improve his life?

[00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:22.140]
That's what he needs to find out.

[00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:24.040]
Oh, in other words, he's given people advice.

[00:34:24.540 --> 00:34:25.780]
Oh, my God.

[00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:27.420]
I am that hemorrhoid.

[00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:31.980]
And some lady on an ever given advice on how to, you know, relationships and crap like.

[00:34:32.020 --> 00:34:33.160]
It was like 330 in the morning.

[00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:37.800]
How does the horse workout by the way?

[00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:38.760]
W of BGT.

[00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:39.200]
I'm not sure.

[00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:39.440]
Yeah.

[00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:41.100]
WDDT, yeah.

[00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:41.840]
Just for it.

[00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:44.600]
But I mean, in the same day, it was a disaster.

[00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:46.400]
My, my, my.

[00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:47.140]
Look out now.

[00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:50.460]
Yeah, if you would have just heard blind Mike call in Rick and Suds, it was probably on the same day.

[00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:51.580]
You'd really had a tri-factor.

[00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:53.760]
You'd probably go home and blow in somebody's brains out.

[00:34:54.340 --> 00:34:55.700]
Hey, I've got a request too.

[00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:56.240]
Yes, sir.

[00:34:56.520 --> 00:34:58.300]
Can you play trained Austin?

[00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:01.700]
I'd like to dedicate the train to Austin.

[00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:05.600]
You know, she showed me some pictures of opening.

[00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:07.620]
Oh, kiss your butt.

[00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:08.780]
Yeah, kiss her brain.

[00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:10.160]
Train to Austin.

[00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:11.500]
What is that?

[00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:13.260]
Yeah, that's what it is.

[00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:14.400]
That's exactly what it is.

[00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:17.200]
But my son's an engineer with a railroad up in Illinois.

[00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:17.700]
Yeah.

[00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:22.780]
And if you could play, I'd like to dedicate to him and all the douchebag engineers on the Illinois

[00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:23.500]
Central Railroad.

[00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:23.800]
Okay.

[00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:25.720]
I'll dig around for it.

[00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:26.100]
See ya.

[00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:26.960]
Appreciate you being there.

[00:35:27.060 --> 00:35:27.260]
All right.

[00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:29.280]
So where am I going to find that?

[00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:31.400]
Good question.

[00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:34.020]
Wasn't it on a cart that disappeared and we couldn't play it anymore?

[00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:35.660]
No, no, no, no, no.

[00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:36.880]
We had it back after that.

[00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:40.680]
It was probably like I'm one of the old, I would say it's on here on the best of 92.

[00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:43.440]
That's my best personal guess and guess what it is.

[00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:45.180]
Boy, I haven't lost it.

[00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:45.780]
I'll tell you that.

[00:35:45.980 --> 00:35:48.140]
You're supposed to be the hot shot that knows all this crap.

[00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:49.640]
And of course, in some of them, I'm not a tanneling it.

[00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:55.820]
I guess it's a little bit, you know, no good, no excuse though, but I'm old in the

[00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:56.240]
Fibrile.

[00:35:56.560 --> 00:35:59.220]
So anyway, what tell did he say it was the train to Austin?

[00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:02.020]
I'm really thinking about whether I want to play it or not.

[00:36:02.020 --> 00:36:04.060]
If you get a title that far screwed up, you know what I'm saying?

[00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:04.680]
There it is.

[00:36:05.060 --> 00:36:05.920]
What does it call?

[00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:07.260]
I don't know what it is.

[00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:09.320]
No, it's called, where the hell is it?

[00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:16.300]
I was riding on a train to Austin, Texas.

[00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:23.240]
Oh, and a very lovely lady said next to mine.

[00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:32.000]
When she got a pretty tour, she asked to buy what holds her son.

[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:35.580]
I was more than happy to.

[00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:39.640]
And now there's more I'd like to do.

[00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:40.820]
Are you sure?

[00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:45.060]
I want to kiss her, but she won't let me.

[00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:52.200]
I want to whisper sweet nothings in her rear.

[00:36:52.540 --> 00:36:57.420]
I want to hold her behind.

[00:36:58.720 --> 00:36:59.620]
Brackum.

[00:36:59.780 --> 00:37:01.260]
Close doors and more.

[00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:07.160]
I want to kiss her, but she won't let me.

[00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:14.380]
When she returned, she said she was an actress.

[00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:21.680]
She showed me an album of pictures of her opening,

[00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:24.200]
which she'd been sitting on.

[00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:26.940]
She seemed to swin as she could be,

[00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:30.600]
but I could clearly see.

[00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:35.340]
She was the kind of girl whose romance hearts

[00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:37.140]
has been wrecked and done.

[00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:43.940]
I want to kiss her, but she won't let me.

[00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:50.980]
I want to whisper sweet nothings in her rear.

[00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:56.580]
I want to hold her behind.

[00:37:58.300 --> 00:38:00.180]
Close doors and more.

[00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:06.180]
I want to kiss her, but she won't let me.

[00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:13.480]
Well, I'll never forget the train ride down to Austin.

[00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:21.140]
We're saying you're the sweet and we shared our tales.

[00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:26.860]
But as my heart tried to leave her behind,

[00:38:27.620 --> 00:38:30.360]
regrets are all I was fine,

[00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:35.960]
because I hope that I'd get that girl in the end.

[00:38:38.940 --> 00:38:43.380]
I want to kiss her, but she won't let me.

[00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:50.640]
I want to whisper sweet nothings in her rear.

[00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:56.640]
I want to hold her behind.

[00:38:58.380 --> 00:38:59.820]
Close doors and more.

[00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:03.960]
I want to kiss her, but...

[00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:07.600]
I want to kiss her, but...

[00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:13.060]
I want to kiss her, but she won't let me.

[00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:17.020]
1049 and WID.

[00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:18.780]
Did we miss a break there or something?

[00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:19.680]
Not yet.

[00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:20.840]
What do you mean?

[00:39:21.020 --> 00:39:22.640]
We didn't do the third one or we didn't do the third one.

[00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:23.800]
We didn't do it.

[00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:24.860]
We better do some spot.

[00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:26.860]
1049 and WID, I just said it.

[00:39:27.180 --> 00:39:27.400]
Okay.

[00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:29.580]
Well, that was short and to the point.

[00:39:29.740 --> 00:39:30.900]
So I'll get my cigar and my purse.

[00:39:31.100 --> 00:39:31.400]
What do you want?

[00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:32.620]
I'm not smoking it, though.

[00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:33.260]
Don't get raw.

[00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:34.440]
Yes, I am.

[00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:35.280]
Okay.

[00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:37.400]
So how's the food coming, by the way?

[00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:39.760]
Why don't you have a blank look on your purse?

[00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:41.860]
Like, so in other words, nobody loves us anymore, huh?

[00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:43.600]
That's really grotesque.

[00:39:43.620 --> 00:39:48.400]
Can you imagine the billions of pounds of crap that are being consumed today

[00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:52.440]
and also being excreted at the same, well, not at the same time,

[00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:53.120]
but shortly later?

[00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:55.200]
I mean, we're going to sit here starving to death,

[00:39:55.980 --> 00:39:58.500]
because nobody gives a crap about us being here on a holiday.

[00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:00.240]
That really is outrageous and disgusting.

[00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:00.960]
And I...

[00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:01.680]
Well, that's good.

[00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:02.380]

[00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:04.020]
About being a Dallas Cowboys fan.

[00:40:04.140 --> 00:40:04.320]
Yes.

[00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:07.420]
And he talks about a song that you have for Tro Aikman.

[00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:07.820]
Yes.

[00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:09.460]
Can you play it for me?

[00:40:10.940 --> 00:40:12.080]
Have a great day, sweetheart.

[00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:13.880]
How's that for service, huh?

[00:40:14.340 --> 00:40:14.540]
Yeah.

[00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:15.100]
Okay.

[00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:16.120]
See you.

[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.900]
I wonder Troi likes to wish Boned Offense, you think so?

[00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:23.620]
When this quarterback gets lonely.

[00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:25.900]
All right.

[00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:28.860]
He likes receivers that are wise.

[00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:35.100]
Some people say that number eight is gay.

[00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:41.140]
They say Troi loves the big brown eye Aikman.

[00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:46.300]
He goes down on his knees Aikman.

[00:40:47.940 --> 00:40:51.460]
It's guys he likes to please Aikman.

[00:40:51.460 --> 00:40:56.860]
He loves to slap cowboys on their behind.

[00:40:57.600 --> 00:40:57.980]
Rack them.

[00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:04.680]
He's got a spotless reputation.

[00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:09.420]
America's team is world renowned.

[00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:13.500]
But is Troi gay?

[00:41:14.220 --> 00:41:17.960]
I've heard some people say they've got him.

[00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:20.240]
The heart will he goes down.

[00:41:21.620 --> 00:41:22.080]
Aikman.

[00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:23.640]
Boy.

[00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:27.280]
He goes down on his knees Aikman.

[00:41:27.580 --> 00:41:28.360]
I like it.

[00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:32.320]
I can't some balls to squeeze Aikman.

[00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:40.320]
Don't clip him cause he likes it from behind.

[00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:43.480]
I'm going to tell you they're going to take a whooping today, man.

[00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:44.500]
I just can smell it.

[00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:45.260]
I can feel it.

[00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:47.080]
I think that the red skins are going to do it.

[00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:50.480]
He's not going to play but he looks good on the sideline.

[00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:52.340]
We have two open lines in date.

[00:41:52.540 --> 00:41:53.560]
He looks good.

[00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:54.240]
He can't play.

[00:41:54.420 --> 00:41:55.040]
What's wrong with that?

[00:41:55.540 --> 00:41:57.140]
He's got that big whoop nose.

[00:41:57.400 --> 00:41:58.160]
He's been playing.

[00:41:58.260 --> 00:41:59.000]
I don't know what's with him.

[00:41:59.420 --> 00:42:02.420]
I have no idea what's with the red skins or the four skins.

[00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:03.960]
But they're doing it for some reason.

[00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:06.060]
A cowboys you can smell it.

[00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:07.880]
Maybe Leon Lettle brings some of the good stuff today.

[00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:10.480]
What a disgrace that team is.

[00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:13.420]
There's a good bunch of world models for all of the youth of America.

[00:42:13.420 --> 00:42:15.500]
It's the Dal-ass cowboys baby.

[00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:18.160]
And they're worried about his Troy maybe like a pack in it.

[00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:19.720]
Maybe he wants to play for the Packers.

[00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:21.460]
We have two open lines in date.

[00:42:21.780 --> 00:42:23.520]
622-9463.

[00:42:23.820 --> 00:42:25.420]
We have nobody bringing us no lunch today.

[00:42:25.540 --> 00:42:29.040]
Which Joey is thinking about why did he come here and spend an hour trying to find the studio.

[00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:31.600]
We have really lost it.

[00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:34.300]
Look at how hard we had to work to get our friend's salad.

[00:42:34.460 --> 00:42:36.460]
We get this 85,000 cases of sole water.

[00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:39.060]
We're telling you right now, thanks Sal and national distributors.

[00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:44.040]
And although yesterday when Lorenzo said over that breastseola and mozzarella.

[00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:45.860]
Oh God is that good.

[00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:46.840]
Woo!

[00:42:48.220 --> 00:42:50.460]
You could go right to Italy and not get breastseola.

[00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:52.360]
Which is kind of like an Italian chip beef.

[00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:54.000]
Which doesn't sound all that great, but it is.

[00:42:54.620 --> 00:42:56.260]
It's really kind of like a red meat.

[00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:57.200]
Ever see any red meat.

[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:00.260]
But man, is that sensational?

[00:43:00.420 --> 00:43:01.340]
Thank you David Lorenzo.

[00:43:01.460 --> 00:43:01.900]
There's a guy.

[00:43:02.100 --> 00:43:03.860]
There's a sponsor who cares about us.

[00:43:04.180 --> 00:43:05.500]
Is David over at Lorenzo's.

[00:43:05.540 --> 00:43:06.520]
They give a crap about us.

[00:43:06.740 --> 00:43:07.640]
Some of these other people.

[00:43:08.580 --> 00:43:11.520]
Whenever they can use this and manipulate us and whatever they need us.

[00:43:11.700 --> 00:43:13.900]
By the way, if you bought a spot on the station and it's not been running,

[00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:15.640]
don't worry about it because Mary's under a lot of stress.

[00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:20.220]
And so is George.

[00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:21.940]
And so is Wayne and so is Adam.

[00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:24.400]
But hey, it's a but hey.

[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:26.600]
Let's go to Sunrise.

[00:43:27.060 --> 00:43:27.400]
Hello.

[00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:28.520]
Neil.

[00:43:28.740 --> 00:43:29.120]
Yes man.

[00:43:29.380 --> 00:43:30.140]
Hi, happy Thanksgiving.

[00:43:30.380 --> 00:43:31.000]
And back to you.

[00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:33.660]
Did you happen to catch any of the Pittsburgh Montreal game?

[00:43:33.900 --> 00:43:34.440]
No I did not.

[00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:36.060]
Too-too-time by the way I understand.

[00:43:36.060 --> 00:43:38.500]
Yeah, if I watched it, Stubborn's played an awesome game.

[00:43:38.620 --> 00:43:39.000]
Did he really?

[00:43:39.220 --> 00:43:39.760]
I'm a huge fan.

[00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:40.880]
Oh, I want Stubborn.

[00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:41.680]
We want a back.

[00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:41.900]
We want a back.

[00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:43.580]
We want a back.

[00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:45.540]
They broke my heart when they traded him.

[00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:46.820]
Yeah, I love Stubborn.

[00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:47.460]
I do too.

[00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:48.400]
Let me take a look.

[00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:49.540]
Did he get any points in acting?

[00:43:49.660 --> 00:43:50.140]
No, he didn't.

[00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:51.560]
But he got named Player of the Game.

[00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:52.060]
Really?

[00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:52.800]
Yes he did.

[00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:53.840]
Player of the Game.

[00:43:54.220 --> 00:43:55.160]
He played awesome.

[00:43:55.320 --> 00:43:56.240]
The rest of the team blows.

[00:43:57.340 --> 00:43:59.340]
He was making awesome passes, setting up the guys.

[00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:00.700]
And they were doing nothing with it.

[00:44:01.140 --> 00:44:02.220]
He looked so frustrated.

[00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:03.780]
I just, I felt so bad for him.

[00:44:03.780 --> 00:44:06.260]
I see Yager got his 19th who leads the league by the way.

[00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:09.560]
I also see Patrick Frog was like a human civ against the Rangers last night.

[00:44:09.660 --> 00:44:09.760]
Yeah.

[00:44:09.820 --> 00:44:11.880]
Which is good for us because the Rangers aren't going anywhere.

[00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:16.220]
And Colorado now has got, we got two games in hand on them and we still got a point on them.

[00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:17.040]
We're still first in league.

[00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:17.680]
How do you like that?

[00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:18.200]
I love it.

[00:44:18.340 --> 00:44:19.560]
So the Lancer are falling.

[00:44:19.740 --> 00:44:21.100]
They're having an avalanche right on the race.

[00:44:21.580 --> 00:44:23.100]
I like it better when the Rangers lose though.

[00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:25.000]
Yeah, but well, you don't have to worry about that.

[00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:26.520]
They got plenty of losses coming soon.

[00:44:26.740 --> 00:44:26.740]

[00:44:26.820 --> 00:44:27.120]
I know.

[00:44:28.100 --> 00:44:28.640]
But I think they're going to be better.

[00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:29.600]
And how about my Leafs?

[00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:30.060]
Yeah.

[00:44:30.940 --> 00:44:31.860]
They got trounce.

[00:44:31.940 --> 00:44:32.500]
Well, you know.

[00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:33.340]
That's a rough year.

[00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:33.940]
We'll be all right.

[00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:34.480]
What can you do?

[00:44:34.700 --> 00:44:36.280]
We'll be okay when Tim Horton comes back.

[00:44:36.580 --> 00:44:37.500]
All right.

[00:44:38.260 --> 00:44:38.940]
I just want to call him.

[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:42.380]
Wish you a happy Thanksgiving and let you know that I love to barred tonight.

[00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:42.600]

[00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:42.780]
I'm deepressed.

[00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:43.800]
We want Stewie back.

[00:44:43.940 --> 00:44:44.800]
Let's start a campaign.

[00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:46.980]
You and I, we want Stewie back now if not sooner.

[00:44:47.300 --> 00:44:48.200]
Can we send him something?

[00:44:48.620 --> 00:44:49.960]
We should send him something to Pittsburgh.

[00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:51.920]
Let him know everyone in Florida misses him.

[00:44:52.020 --> 00:44:52.260]
Okay.

[00:44:52.340 --> 00:44:53.380]
We'll send him a big killbassa.

[00:44:53.860 --> 00:44:54.800]
Have a great day, sweetheart.

[00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:55.280]
You too.

[00:44:55.340 --> 00:44:55.840]
Bye-bye.

[00:44:56.060 --> 00:44:57.000]
What a great guy, Stew Barnes.

[00:44:57.120 --> 00:45:00.060]
Everybody loves Stew Barnes and then we get these ass liquors calling him.

[00:45:00.060 --> 00:45:02.140]
Oh no, this Chris Wells is going to be great.

[00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:03.460]
You know, whatever Brian Maria is.

[00:45:03.460 --> 00:45:04.800]
Brian Maria is a genius.

[00:45:04.980 --> 00:45:06.060]
Okay. He's a wonderful guy.

[00:45:06.060 --> 00:45:06.800]
He's phenomenal.

[00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:07.460]
He's the best.

[00:45:07.660 --> 00:45:09.240]
But that doesn't mean he's perfect.

[00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:12.500]
And all you rubber stampers out there, all you ass liquors, you better get with it.

[00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:13.960]
And by the way, what's icing?

[00:45:14.500 --> 00:45:16.840]
So it's 1057 at WIOD.

[00:45:17.660 --> 00:45:21.160]
Stew, the only radio station that doesn't suck.

[00:45:21.820 --> 00:45:23.060]
Six, ten WIOD.

[00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:25.460]
Miami, Fort Lauderdale.

[00:45:25.900 --> 00:45:27.300]
This is the Neorodger show.

[00:45:28.540 --> 00:45:30.160]
This is your brain.

[00:45:31.700 --> 00:45:33.160]
Any questions?

[00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:34.500]

[00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:38.340]
Ooh.

[00:45:40.860 --> 00:45:41.000]
Ooh.

[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:42.000]

[00:45:42.540 --> 00:45:42.840]
Ooh.

[00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:42.840]

[00:45:51.540 --> 00:45:52.340]
Just lick them.

[00:45:52.340 --> 00:45:53.920]
People are watching.

[00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:58.720]
Women are staring at their green roof envy.

[00:45:58.840 --> 00:46:03.660]
Oh, but I'm not sharing some say his brain less.

[00:46:03.740 --> 00:46:05.660]
And I'm not sure I'm talking.

[00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:08.260]
Not much to look at.

[00:46:08.620 --> 00:46:10.400]
But I ain't looking.

[00:46:10.660 --> 00:46:14.300]
His smells just a little too much.

[00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:18.600]
Is that all a little too close?

[00:46:19.580 --> 00:46:23.500]
His nose is just a little too long.

[00:46:25.220 --> 00:46:27.280]
But while they're grown in,

[00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:30.160]
I will be more than tall in.

[00:46:30.500 --> 00:46:33.640]
His got a really big trowel's a trowel.

[00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:37.900]
And his trowel's looks green if he let it out.

[00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:42.660]
And his got a really big trowel's a trowel.

[00:46:48.900 --> 00:46:52.960]
His got a really big trowel's a trowel.

[00:46:53.580 --> 00:46:57.080]
That part can make me a just wisdom shout.

[00:46:58.380 --> 00:47:03.060]
His got a really big trowel's a trowel's a trowel.

[00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:08.040]
I wanna give you a clam.

[00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:15.740]
He's got a woman in the baby Charles and Charles.

[00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:20.380]
He's got a woman in the baby Charles and Charles.

[00:47:21.020 --> 00:47:22.200]
They should fall low.

[00:47:25.660 --> 00:47:26.780]
I have no foreskin.

[00:47:28.260 --> 00:47:30.660]
So anyway, it's $11.02 when it's out.

[00:47:30.740 --> 00:47:31.300]
You know what they say?

[00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:32.840]
It cocks, bleep it out.

[00:47:33.540 --> 00:47:35.680]
So we're just rolling along singing the song.

[00:47:35.740 --> 00:47:36.860]
Looks like we're going hungry today.

[00:47:37.020 --> 00:47:39.680]
A bit of the whole audience is saying, boy, they have sure lost it.

[00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:40.540]
They've lost the touch.

[00:47:40.540 --> 00:47:42.280]
They've lost that love and nothing again.

[00:47:42.440 --> 00:47:45.600]
Don't start me with that song again because I'll puke if I think about anybody planning.

[00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:47.220]
How does Honey Fox doing, by the way?

[00:47:47.300 --> 00:47:48.220]
Hi, this is Johnny Fox.

[00:47:48.440 --> 00:47:49.080]
Playing all the country.

[00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:49.700]
It's all the time.

[00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:50.660]
He's kissing it over there.

[00:47:50.840 --> 00:47:52.680]
I wonder if he and Dom Cox are on the same.

[00:47:52.740 --> 00:47:53.740]
Are they both doing it?

[00:47:54.100 --> 00:47:55.340]
I'm kissing. They're both kissing it.

[00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:57.680]
I want to give you a kiss.

[00:47:58.160 --> 00:47:59.380]
Here's Pembroke Pines. Hello.

[00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:00.140]
Neil.

[00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:00.680]
Yes, sir.

[00:48:00.820 --> 00:48:02.040]
Hey, happy Thanksgiving day.

[00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:02.800]
Back to you, pal.

[00:48:03.160 --> 00:48:05.360]
Hey, I got a spy report from Mandage for you last night.

[00:48:05.460 --> 00:48:05.660]
Yeah.

[00:48:05.860 --> 00:48:06.520]
You know what he said?

[00:48:06.520 --> 00:48:11.980]
He said, um, the only thing that other station QAM is missing, they have their great lineup,

[00:48:11.980 --> 00:48:14.480]
but the only thing they're missing is Neil Roger.

[00:48:14.480 --> 00:48:21.000]
Yeah, little joy was just going to be a spy report before saying that he was going on sucking around heavy duty about how they all to have me on that station.

[00:48:21.140 --> 00:48:22.580]
Where would they get the money to pay me?

[00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:25.920]
They're already going to go broke with all the money they paid for all these sports franchises.

[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:29.540]
And with the asylians at dollars, they paid the default, which is way more than what he's worth.

[00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:31.500]
What were they, forget it?

[00:48:32.120 --> 00:48:34.240]
See, I like working for an outfit with a check clear.

[00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:34.880]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:36.460]
You don't have to worry about if it's going to bounce or not.

[00:48:36.600 --> 00:48:37.620]
Well, I guess so, huh?

[00:48:38.020 --> 00:48:38.240]
Geez.

[00:48:39.380 --> 00:48:42.260]
Well, I just wanted to tell you that and let you know and happy turkey day.

[00:48:42.460 --> 00:48:43.000]
And back to you.

[00:48:43.140 --> 00:48:44.800]
And I hope you get some lunch in there pretty soon.

[00:48:44.900 --> 00:48:45.120]
All right.

[00:48:45.340 --> 00:48:46.000]
Okay. Thanks.

[00:48:46.560 --> 00:48:47.640]
Yeah, man, which is great.

[00:48:47.740 --> 00:48:49.720]
And I've already said this before he started sucking around.

[00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:50.720]
Maybe that's why he said it.

[00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:55.400]
But that we have a deep mutual respect, me and Jimmy Boy, even though he is a Michigan fan.

[00:48:55.560 --> 00:48:56.900]
He knows talent when he hears it.

[00:48:57.020 --> 00:48:58.120]
I made him into a star.

[00:48:58.820 --> 00:49:00.420]
Just being on here and doing those games.

[00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:01.500]
That isn't what made him a star.

[00:49:01.500 --> 00:49:02.440]
What made him a star was.

[00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:02.880]
All right.

[00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:03.680]
Stuff like that.

[00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:05.960]
That's right.

[00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:10.900]
That's what made him into a gigantic star was things like, look at the **** on that blonde, man.

[00:49:11.080 --> 00:49:11.280]
Right.

[00:49:11.580 --> 00:49:12.720]
And then of course, especially.

[00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:13.520]
Yes.

[00:49:15.060 --> 00:49:15.420]
Yes.

[00:49:16.420 --> 00:49:17.400]
Not to be not to forget.

[00:49:17.560 --> 00:49:18.340]
You checked out.

[00:49:18.440 --> 00:49:18.580]
Right.

[00:49:19.060 --> 00:49:23.020]
So he'll be winding up being over there because he's going to be doing the games with Zinfur on QAM.

[00:49:23.060 --> 00:49:25.380]
And of course, that is if they don't declare chapter 13 first.

[00:49:25.540 --> 00:49:26.680]
But hey, how about those marlins?

[00:49:26.680 --> 00:49:27.920]
They got John Canjolosi.

[00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:31.080]
Which sounds like Canjolosi sounds like some kind of a like leprosy.

[00:49:31.080 --> 00:49:32.960]
Some kind of a rare disease.

[00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:34.340]
But they'll be okay.

[00:49:34.500 --> 00:49:35.120]
They're going to go out there.

[00:49:35.180 --> 00:49:36.460]
Wayne is on least a pocketbook.

[00:49:36.460 --> 00:49:38.000]
He got all pissed off at your aunt's.

[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:38.940]
They're if he said you were an asshole.

[00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:39.840]
You don't want to pay.

[00:49:39.900 --> 00:49:40.920]
You want all these salary kept.

[00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:45.140]
Then you get $55 million to that professional malcontent Alfred Albert Bell.

[00:49:45.320 --> 00:49:46.140]
You jackass.

[00:49:46.480 --> 00:49:48.220]
So even Wayne voted for the settlement.

[00:49:48.300 --> 00:49:49.020]
How do you like that?

[00:49:49.380 --> 00:49:50.600]
That's really saying something.

[00:49:51.180 --> 00:49:53.640]
So I guess that means that now that he's a good guy.

[00:49:53.740 --> 00:49:55.920]
We won't play that Wayne is an asshole song anymore, right?

[00:49:56.340 --> 00:49:56.560]
Oops.

[00:49:58.480 --> 00:49:59.840]
Do we really want to play this or not?

[00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:03.240]
Asshole, asshole.

[00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:04.280]
Yes we do.

[00:50:04.540 --> 00:50:07.680]
That Wayne Heisinga's such an asshole.

[00:50:08.580 --> 00:50:11.740]
He yelled at Manish that greedy churn.

[00:50:12.180 --> 00:50:16.660]
You turt because he wouldn't take a shower with Hank Olberg.

[00:50:18.620 --> 00:50:20.380]
Asshole, asshole.

[00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:24.740]
He's Wayne Heisinga's such an asshole.

[00:50:25.700 --> 00:50:28.700]
He's just like Hitler and Abe Abron.

[00:50:28.700 --> 00:50:31.700]
What's that he's pounding on?

[00:50:52.540 --> 00:50:56.680]
Asshole, asshole.

[00:50:57.440 --> 00:51:01.040]
Wayne is the quintessential asshole.

[00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:06.860]
The only thing there is left to say is drop jam.

[00:51:07.180 --> 00:51:08.400]
Right away.

[00:51:09.140 --> 00:51:14.560]
So our good post-Personal friends at Boston market of all places come through force on our at Hollywood Boulevard.

[00:51:14.560 --> 00:51:15.920]
Little joys on his way immediately.

[00:51:16.180 --> 00:51:18.700]
They might not have the meatloaf while turkey and ham suffice.

[00:51:20.100 --> 00:51:22.860]
It's a limited menu today because it's, you know, Thanksgiving.

[00:51:29.380 --> 00:51:30.800]
They may have it or not.

[00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:32.480]
What do you mean they may have it?

[00:51:34.680 --> 00:51:36.520]
It's a limited Thanksgiving menu today.

[00:51:36.580 --> 00:51:36.780]
Yeah.

[00:51:38.220 --> 00:51:44.120]
So like from yesterday when they closed until whenever Thanksgiving finally ends, the meatloaf has vanished.

[00:51:44.320 --> 00:51:44.840]
It's disappeared.

[00:51:45.260 --> 00:51:46.740]
Tell them to go dig around.

[00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:47.460]
They'll find some meat.

[00:51:48.140 --> 00:51:51.720]
I've learned in my life if you dig around long enough and far enough, you'll find some meat.

[00:51:52.300 --> 00:51:53.960]
Anyway, so thanks, Joey.

[00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:54.960]
Wayne is on his way for the food.

[00:51:55.120 --> 00:51:56.080]
Whatever they got will take it.

[00:51:56.140 --> 00:51:56.300]
Okay?

[00:51:56.360 --> 00:52:00.860]
Are we going to be choosy today with everybody closed with our best close personal friends just shining us today?

[00:52:01.160 --> 00:52:04.800]
Just when you go into pizza loft, tell Jeff Cohen, boy, you are a major asshole, man.

[00:52:05.300 --> 00:52:09.600]
Let those guys down on Thanksgiving day when they come into work hard for you and to give you,

[00:52:09.700 --> 00:52:11.920]
and he's even got a spot running day ponytail.

[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:13.140]
Oh, wait till we get to that spot.

[00:52:13.140 --> 00:52:14.000]
That ought to be a good one.

[00:52:15.420 --> 00:52:16.580]
Here's coconut creak.

[00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:16.800]
Hello.

[00:52:17.160 --> 00:52:17.780]
Good morning.

[00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:18.340]
Yes, sir.

[00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:18.940]
Happy Thanksgiving.

[00:52:18.940 --> 00:52:19.720]
And back to you.

[00:52:19.860 --> 00:52:23.960]
I'd like to give you an uplifting how I screwed over a frog story, if you'd like to hear it.

[00:52:24.120 --> 00:52:24.280]
Yeah.

[00:52:26.080 --> 00:52:29.900]
I have the, I do work, I work in convenience stores.

[00:52:29.900 --> 00:52:31.760]
I will service convenience stores.

[00:52:31.780 --> 00:52:32.260]
You told them?

[00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:33.400]
Absolutely.

[00:52:33.660 --> 00:52:34.420]
Whatever they need.

[00:52:34.540 --> 00:52:34.940]
I told you.

[00:52:35.700 --> 00:52:38.140]
I was in a mobile station down in Hollywood.

[00:52:39.240 --> 00:52:45.760]
And there was probably about three or four people in line and this real, snolly looking old frog walked in.

[00:52:46.180 --> 00:52:47.600]
And that's what it didn't feel like waiting.

[00:52:47.860 --> 00:52:49.500]
It didn't feel like waiting in line.

[00:52:49.840 --> 00:52:53.800]
So he muscled up to the front and he was basically looking for directions of what it was.

[00:52:54.060 --> 00:52:58.620]
And from what I could gather with his stupid accent, he was looking for some place in Lake Worth.

[00:52:59.040 --> 00:53:02.740]
Oh, yeah, that's a good place for him where the people are older than a Mathuzlana bad day, yes.

[00:53:02.860 --> 00:53:03.180]
Absolutely.

[00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:04.040]
If it didn't like a frog.

[00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:04.700]
Right.

[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:08.420]
So the cashier didn't really know where he was going.

[00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:10.840]
She said, you know, he said, well, do you have a map?

[00:53:11.540 --> 00:53:14.000]
And she said, well, you have to purchase it because they were wrapped in plastic.

[00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:15.900]
You'd have to rip it apart if you wanted to use it.

[00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:16.660]
Well, he didn't like that.

[00:53:16.700 --> 00:53:18.220]
So I pulled him aside and I said, come on out.

[00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:19.760]
And I basically took him out.

[00:53:19.760 --> 00:53:21.080]
No, because then he'd have to buy it.

[00:53:21.080 --> 00:53:24.540]
But he probably wanted it was just to look at it, unfold, you know, and punch you around with it.

[00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:27.220]
And then just throw it down on the floor and walk out.

[00:53:27.320 --> 00:53:28.680]
Absolutely. That's exactly what you wanted.

[00:53:28.820 --> 00:53:29.660]
Oh, isn't that great?

[00:53:29.800 --> 00:53:31.300]
What a cheap bastard that is.

[00:53:31.480 --> 00:53:34.840]
So what I did is, and I knew there were people watching that they were listening.

[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:36.680]
They were kind of upset because he cut in line anyway.

[00:53:36.780 --> 00:53:37.440]
So I grabbed them.

[00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:38.140]
I said, come on outside.

[00:53:38.140 --> 00:53:39.140]
And I said, I'll give you directions.

[00:53:39.840 --> 00:53:41.900]
So I sent them on to 95.

[00:53:41.900 --> 00:53:43.960]
Now, I assumed he was looking for Lake Worth.

[00:53:44.060 --> 00:53:47.140]
I know that 10th Avenue north is up there.

[00:53:47.340 --> 00:53:47.480]
Right.

[00:53:47.740 --> 00:53:51.060]
So what I did is I told him to get on to 95, which he was very familiar with.

[00:53:51.480 --> 00:53:54.200]
And I told him to go to Southwest Tenth Street.

[00:53:54.280 --> 00:53:56.580]
He said, ah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I know that 10th Street Tenth Street Lake Worth.

[00:53:57.040 --> 00:53:58.800]
So I sent them to Southwest Tenth Street.

[00:53:58.920 --> 00:54:01.400]
I told him to go about three miles west to the left.

[00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:03.540]
So I go about three, four miles west.

[00:54:03.660 --> 00:54:04.680]
You'll come to a toll booth.

[00:54:05.300 --> 00:54:08.240]
Go through the toll booth and when you see university drive,

[00:54:08.700 --> 00:54:10.520]
you'll have to exit and go right.

[00:54:11.260 --> 00:54:13.580]
So he's somewhere and I hopefully still somewhere in time.

[00:54:13.580 --> 00:54:15.000]
He probably wound up at Sloanies.

[00:54:15.140 --> 00:54:16.120]
Yeah, he's at Sloanies.

[00:54:16.240 --> 00:54:17.240]
He's somewhere in Parkland.

[00:54:17.420 --> 00:54:18.660]
Hopefully he's with Rick Riley.

[00:54:18.780 --> 00:54:19.500]
Nice work, pal.

[00:54:19.720 --> 00:54:20.240]
You like that?

[00:54:20.340 --> 00:54:20.680]
Excellent.

[00:54:20.980 --> 00:54:21.980]
Can I get a request?

[00:54:22.220 --> 00:54:22.740]
Yes, you can.

[00:54:22.760 --> 00:54:24.960]
I know you don't like to podge your own with Riley's stuff,

[00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:26.160]
but that Boca song?

[00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:28.340]
Let me just tell you something.

[00:54:28.500 --> 00:54:30.440]
Okay. That's not Riley's stuff.

[00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:31.220]
That one happened.

[00:54:31.420 --> 00:54:33.560]
I will admit that I spoke to a joints.

[00:54:33.560 --> 00:54:35.180]
That's one that he played years ago and lost.

[00:54:35.480 --> 00:54:36.260]
And I just found it.

[00:54:36.320 --> 00:54:36.900]
So it's mine now.

[00:54:37.180 --> 00:54:39.640]
But the Boca thing, Boca Brian did that for me originally.

[00:54:39.640 --> 00:54:41.760]
And then Rick kind of inherited it.

[00:54:41.760 --> 00:54:42.720]
He kind of swiped it.

[00:54:42.860 --> 00:54:45.320]
And also I want to call somebody a douchebag.

[00:54:45.480 --> 00:54:47.700]
But before I do it, I just want to let you know this person.

[00:54:47.840 --> 00:54:48.700]
I'm going to call a douchebag.

[00:54:48.900 --> 00:54:51.460]
His last name is the same as your head engineer.

[00:54:52.580 --> 00:54:52.860]
Okay.

[00:54:53.240 --> 00:54:55.700]
And so if I say his name, you can throw that in there.

[00:54:55.820 --> 00:54:56.040]
Yeah.

[00:54:56.540 --> 00:54:59.340]
Okay, we've got Winston and Jim Roy.

[00:54:59.880 --> 00:55:00.740]
A broke douchebag.

[00:55:00.780 --> 00:55:02.100]
And don't forget Patrick Roy.

[00:55:03.200 --> 00:55:03.860]
Have a great day, pal.

[00:55:03.880 --> 00:55:04.080]
Thanks.

[00:55:04.240 --> 00:55:04.660]
Nice job.

[00:55:05.040 --> 00:55:06.120]
There's a guy who's doing it, man.

[00:55:07.700 --> 00:55:09.400]
So this is Rick Riley's, huh?

[00:55:09.580 --> 00:55:10.580]
Just like my briefcases.

[00:55:13.820 --> 00:55:14.380]
What?

[00:55:14.600 --> 00:55:15.760]
There's a marvelous place.

[00:55:16.080 --> 00:55:18.380]
I know all the wealthy people go.

[00:55:18.960 --> 00:55:20.780]
It's where royalty play follow.

[00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:22.660]
And that's what I like about Boca.

[00:55:23.260 --> 00:55:25.140]
A down there he goes on never small.

[00:55:25.580 --> 00:55:26.680]
A down where they say,

[00:55:26.840 --> 00:55:27.260]
Help troll.

[00:55:27.680 --> 00:55:29.200]
And every corner has a wall.

[00:55:29.660 --> 00:55:31.100]
And that's what I like about Boca.

[00:55:44.100 --> 00:55:46.560]
Spend 10 grand on golf course fees.

[00:55:46.860 --> 00:55:48.580]
Spend the day in Jewish bakeries.

[00:55:48.680 --> 00:55:50.420]
You should taste these delicacies.

[00:55:50.800 --> 00:55:52.200]
And that's what I like about Boca.

[00:55:52.300 --> 00:55:54.360]
Oh, these excuse our attitudes.

[00:55:55.120 --> 00:55:56.920]
And our BMWs.

[00:55:57.100 --> 00:55:59.020]
We find pleasure in being rude.

[00:55:59.320 --> 00:56:00.660]
And that's what I like about Boca.

[00:56:00.820 --> 00:56:01.080]
Raw.

[00:56:01.080 --> 00:56:01.080]

[00:56:01.080 --> 00:56:01.080]

[00:56:01.080 --> 00:56:01.080]

[00:56:01.080 --> 00:56:01.080]

[00:56:01.080 --> 00:56:01.080]

[00:56:01.080 --> 00:56:01.080]

[00:56:13.660 --> 00:56:15.960]
Who chees belts and Rolex watches?

[00:56:16.320 --> 00:56:18.160]
White shoes make us so obnoxious.

[00:56:18.280 --> 00:56:20.160]
If you're clean, let you touch us.

[00:56:20.320 --> 00:56:21.740]
And that's what I like about Boca.

[00:56:22.100 --> 00:56:24.120]
We really don't care what you think.

[00:56:24.500 --> 00:56:26.220]
You see how a doo-doo doesn't stink.

[00:56:26.660 --> 00:56:27.440]
There's no coffee.

[00:56:27.840 --> 00:56:28.500]
Only Mocha.

[00:56:28.760 --> 00:56:30.140]
And that's what I like about Boca.

[00:56:42.180 --> 00:56:42.580]
Yeah.

[00:56:42.780 --> 00:56:43.180]
Yeah.

[00:56:43.520 --> 00:56:45.240]
That's what I like about Boca.

[00:56:46.160 --> 00:56:48.700]
Oh, and by the way, speaking of the murdering OJ,

[00:56:49.580 --> 00:56:52.220]
did you see the story yesterday and not everything that comes along?

[00:56:52.400 --> 00:56:54.520]
You know, we got 20 witnesses that he's contradicting.

[00:56:54.760 --> 00:56:55.200]
He's contradicting.

[00:56:55.260 --> 00:56:56.640]
All don't confuse me with the facts.

[00:56:56.680 --> 00:56:57.840]
Basically, it was his testimony.

[00:56:57.840 --> 00:57:00.340]
So the new deal was, you know, the Bruno Mungly shoes.

[00:57:01.100 --> 00:57:03.260]
And he said that the photo was doctored.

[00:57:03.320 --> 00:57:05.040]
The one that the guy sold to the National Enquirer.

[00:57:05.140 --> 00:57:05.620]
Well, guess what?

[00:57:05.720 --> 00:57:10.140]
They found another publication that had published it before the murders.

[00:57:11.220 --> 00:57:12.880]
So somebody must have been psychic.

[00:57:12.940 --> 00:57:17.860]
There must be a psychic conspiracy because they must have known that the murders would take place.

[00:57:18.160 --> 00:57:21.280]
That they would be leaving a shoe print with Bruno Mungly shoes.

[00:57:21.600 --> 00:57:24.280]
And so they must have doctored the photo even before the murders took place.

[00:57:24.280 --> 00:57:25.040]
How do you like that?

[00:57:25.040 --> 00:57:29.860]
So I don't want to say that the man might just possibly be guilty.

[00:57:31.280 --> 00:57:31.960]
Oh, man.

[00:57:32.240 --> 00:57:33.000]
Oh, God.

[00:57:33.460 --> 00:57:38.060]
So what is he going to say when they finally get through with the 85,000 more prosecution witnesses

[00:57:38.060 --> 00:57:39.900]
and the defense calls them and puts them on a stand?

[00:57:40.140 --> 00:57:40.940]
What's he going to say then?

[00:57:40.980 --> 00:57:41.700]
Kill the cold.

[00:57:41.780 --> 00:57:42.420]
Oh, thank God.

[00:57:43.320 --> 00:57:44.420]
Better late than ever, OJ.

[00:57:44.700 --> 00:57:45.000]
OJ.

[00:57:46.100 --> 00:57:47.960]
And they're still out there getting autographs.

[00:57:47.960 --> 00:57:50.860]
Hey, OJ, all those assholes, all those ass liquors out there.

[00:57:51.440 --> 00:57:55.020]
Hey, we don't care if our football guys murder a few people or rape the few women or stuff like that.

[00:57:55.020 --> 00:57:59.240]
Or if our favorite boxer raped a couple and went to the Islam or we don't care about that.

[00:57:59.240 --> 00:58:00.620]
He did his time. He's a great American.

[00:58:01.280 --> 00:58:06.000]
We just want to go there and worship at his feet because we only wish we could be half as much as he is.

[00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:08.620]
It's 11th, 13th at WIOD.

[00:58:15.600 --> 00:58:16.000]
Oh.

[00:58:17.600 --> 00:58:18.000]
OJ.

[00:58:20.020 --> 00:58:22.260]
What have you gone and done?

[00:58:23.620 --> 00:58:24.860]
Why did you leave?

[00:58:24.860 --> 00:58:26.420]
The bloody blood.

[00:58:27.540 --> 00:58:31.480]
There were four of you thinking of OJ.

[00:58:33.920 --> 00:58:36.660]
You almost got away.

[00:58:37.020 --> 00:58:41.360]
Oh, best instead of driving around the freeways.

[00:58:41.840 --> 00:58:45.160]
You should have been on Brazilian airways.

[00:58:46.320 --> 00:58:49.260]
All your friends call you the Jew.

[00:58:51.300 --> 00:58:58.800]
They say, I hope the children take care of you.

[00:58:58.800 --> 00:59:03.920]
Oh, OJ.

[00:59:06.460 --> 00:59:08.400]
Man, you could play.

[00:59:09.120 --> 00:59:09.640]
Are you?

[00:59:09.940 --> 00:59:12.820]
I used to watch you bus and tackle.

[00:59:13.560 --> 00:59:16.560]
Now you walk around the shackle.

[00:59:17.840 --> 00:59:18.320]
OJ.

[00:59:19.980 --> 00:59:22.860]
You're on a desert time.

[00:59:23.520 --> 00:59:26.720]
Remember to leave with your back to the corner.

[00:59:27.120 --> 00:59:30.240]
Or you'll be walking like Tina Turner.

[00:59:31.340 --> 00:59:31.820]
OJ.

[00:59:34.220 --> 00:59:35.840]
Let's take up a collection for OJ.

[00:59:35.980 --> 00:59:36.940]
He'd be in big trouble, man.

[00:59:37.020 --> 00:59:39.880]
Even if he doesn't lose the civil case, they said he is broke.

[00:59:40.280 --> 00:59:42.980]
The government's got a $685,000 in on his house.

[00:59:47.360 --> 00:59:50.680]
He's going to boss the chicken.

[00:59:50.800 --> 00:59:54.100]
He's going to blow up a balloon.

[00:59:56.600 --> 00:59:57.660]
Here's Kendall.

[00:59:58.080 --> 00:59:58.280]
Hello.

[01:00:00.980 --> 01:00:04.100]
I have been here complaining about the metro rail.

[01:00:04.860 --> 01:00:09.980]
Having traveled to real cities, I can't imagine you were to attack

[01:00:09.980 --> 01:00:14.000]
something like public transportation, something that real cities have.

[01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:15.900]
We don't have public transportation.

[01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:18.940]
We have a thing that was done for the benefit of the downtown people and the herald,

[01:00:19.100 --> 01:00:20.900]
which only serves a very small number of people.

[01:00:21.260 --> 01:00:21.680]
Guess what?

[01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:23.280]
How's the traffic on Dixie Highway?

[01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:26.140]
I was supposed to solve that problem, which is worse than ever before.

[01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:28.080]
I wouldn't know, because I don't drive.

[01:00:28.860 --> 01:00:29.000]
Yeah.

[01:00:30.820 --> 01:00:35.260]
Cities that have mass transportation like Boston and Toronto and New York,

[01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:37.940]
they have a real subway system or rail system.

[01:00:37.940 --> 01:00:42.800]
You can actually go all over the area instead of a very limited area where nobody wants to go anyway.

[01:00:43.020 --> 01:00:44.540]
How many people do you want to go to Halea?

[01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:46.860]
I don't personally know.

[01:00:46.860 --> 01:00:49.960]
There are probably 100,000 people right now trying to get out of Halea.

[01:00:50.020 --> 01:00:50.960]
Nobody wants to go there.

[01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:55.020]
Unless you want to go to Shorides for ribs, who wants to go down there?

[01:00:55.260 --> 01:00:59.260]
This is Shorides since that day and south, so I'm right there.

[01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:01.200]
Don't think there should be more.

[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:03.540]
You see it is a white elephant.

[01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:04.760]
It isn't white elephant.

[01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:06.860]
The ridership is minimal and it's a piece of crap.

[01:01:06.860 --> 01:01:09.120]
And it cost a billion dollars to build it.

[01:01:10.360 --> 01:01:13.200]
That was the only intelligent thing that Ronald Reagan ever said.

[01:01:13.260 --> 01:01:16.500]
He made the observation after the thing was a bust since it was federal funds.

[01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:19.300]
He said they could have bought everybody in Dade County a car

[01:01:19.300 --> 01:01:21.480]
and had money left over for a billion dollars.

[01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:22.580]
And that was true at the time.

[01:01:23.060 --> 01:01:23.460]
Really?

[01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:25.040]
I don't like to drive myself.

[01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:25.560]
Yeah.

[01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:27.360]
But I would be asking it.

[01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:28.220]
So what's the point?

[01:01:28.340 --> 01:01:28.900]
What are you trying to say?

[01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:29.780]
The metro rail is great?

[01:01:29.940 --> 01:01:30.560]
Okay, it's great.

[01:01:30.660 --> 01:01:31.260]
Have a nice Thanksgiving.

[01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:32.820]
We have an open line in Dade.

[01:01:33.220 --> 01:01:34.800]
6229 for he doesn't like to drive.

[01:01:35.060 --> 01:01:36.040]
Oh, God.

[01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:37.440]
Oh, God.

[01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:41.180]
So while you geek out there who are afraid to drive just to go down the metro rail,

[01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:43.720]
even though it doesn't go where you want to go, get hop on it anyway.

[01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:44.700]
Hop on this, pal.

[01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:46.820]
Here's to Miami on a mobile.

[01:01:46.980 --> 01:01:47.160]
Hello.

[01:01:47.620 --> 01:01:48.280]
Hey, Neil.

[01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:48.880]
Yes, sir.

[01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:49.620]
Good morning.

[01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:51.360]
This stupid holiday, man.

[01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:52.080]
Buenos dias.

[01:01:52.700 --> 01:01:53.340]
Happy Turkey.

[01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:55.320]
Hey, so called religious dudes.

[01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:56.980]
They were once a year to thank God.

[01:01:57.240 --> 01:01:57.460]
Yeah.

[01:01:57.620 --> 01:01:59.980]
Oh, it's like they say at Christmas time.

[01:02:00.020 --> 01:02:01.720]
You know, that's a one day of the year you're supposed to be good.

[01:02:01.940 --> 01:02:04.860]
How about if the other rest of the year you try to be like a decent person,

[01:02:04.860 --> 01:02:06.460]
and at Christmas you go out and screw everybody.

[01:02:06.580 --> 01:02:07.020]
How would that be?

[01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:07.680]
Right, exactly.

[01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:08.720]
That sounds good to me.

[01:02:08.860 --> 01:02:09.320]
When's it coming?

[01:02:09.620 --> 01:02:12.840]
Hey, I'm talking about the good off seat of Miami.

[01:02:13.220 --> 01:02:13.400]
Yeah.

[01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:16.820]
You know, they're in the verge of chapter 9 or 8, whatever.

[01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:18.920]
Do you hear what your carolio said on the news last night?

[01:02:19.060 --> 01:02:19.240]
Yeah.

[01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:20.300]
Don't be 50 dollars.

[01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:20.820]
God.

[01:02:21.660 --> 01:02:27.200]
Anyway, you know, you got all this bunch of freaks, Mr. Tomas Regalado and Fredo Gordete.

[01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:27.380]
Right.

[01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:30.520]
And Hernández and Carroio going to city.

[01:02:30.660 --> 01:02:31.740]
A bunch of an animal people.

[01:02:31.980 --> 01:02:31.980]

[01:02:31.980 --> 01:02:32.240]
Exactly.

[01:02:32.440 --> 01:02:33.880]
You know, so what do you expect?

[01:02:34.020 --> 01:02:34.460]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:34.800]
Right.

[01:02:34.940 --> 01:02:35.360]
What do you expect?

[01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:36.000]
Unbelievable.

[01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:36.500]
Right.

[01:02:36.580 --> 01:02:38.100]
Can you play a whatever you want?

[01:02:38.340 --> 01:02:40.780]
A couple of how to spell a done L.

[01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:42.600]
How to spell with Darn L.

[01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:42.920]
Yeah.

[01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:43.620]
You got it.

[01:02:43.660 --> 01:02:44.040]
Thanks buddy.

[01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:44.720]
Have a happy path.

[01:02:44.740 --> 01:02:45.140]
See you.

[01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:46.440]
Okay.

[01:02:46.540 --> 01:02:49.560]
Don't choke on that swishbone out there while you guys out there will be celebrating today.

[01:02:54.500 --> 01:02:56.960]
This is Lone and the spell with Darn L.

[01:02:57.180 --> 01:03:01.300]
I bet Darn L Jackson, and today we're going to spell the word grammar.

[01:03:01.300 --> 01:03:03.020]
spell it with me now.

[01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:03.880]
grammar.

[01:03:04.540 --> 01:03:06.940]
g-r-a-m-m-a-r.

[01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:09.360]
Now, let's use it in a sentence.

[01:03:10.140 --> 01:03:11.280]
My grammar will be good.

[01:03:12.220 --> 01:03:13.780]
And so's my granddaddy.

[01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:16.480]
This is Lone and the spell with Darn L.

[01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:18.320]
I bet Darn L. Jackson.

[01:03:25.300 --> 01:03:27.520]
This is Lone and the spell with Darn L.

[01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:29.200]
I bet Darn L. Jackson.

[01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:31.980]
And today we're going to spell the word paradise.

[01:03:32.540 --> 01:03:33.660]
spell it with me now.

[01:03:34.020 --> 01:03:34.460]
Paradise.

[01:03:35.180 --> 01:03:37.260]
g-r-a-d-i-s-b.

[01:03:37.580 --> 01:03:39.640]
Now, let's use it in a sentence.

[01:03:40.260 --> 01:03:44.480]
Whenever I go out to gamble, I always take along my luck as paradise.

[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:45.820]
Be good to me now.

[01:03:46.260 --> 01:03:48.500]
This is Lone and the spell with Darn L.

[01:03:48.740 --> 01:03:50.480]
I bet Darn L. Jackson.

[01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:52.140]
I didn't know Darn L was port of Rican, did you?

[01:03:52.580 --> 01:03:56.460]
Isn't that a port of Rican thing with the dice hanging from the area of whom here is that a...

[01:03:56.460 --> 01:03:57.600]
What is that?

[01:03:58.480 --> 01:04:00.080]
It's just any kind of low life.

[01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:04.240]
I see white trash people around here.

[01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:08.020]
That was George Rodriguez who said that the port of Rican's her low life is what he said.

[01:04:08.060 --> 01:04:10.640]
He didn't come right out and say that, but that what he was saying being a Cuban himself.

[01:04:10.940 --> 01:04:12.740]
The port of Rican's usually wave their flag.

[01:04:12.860 --> 01:04:14.160]
The Cubans have like a little...

[01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:16.260]
They have like a little Cuban flag hanging from their flag.

[01:04:16.340 --> 01:04:17.300]
Those are port of Rican's.

[01:04:17.580 --> 01:04:18.040]
And all my life...

[01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:19.340]
Port of Rican's have a Cuban flag?

[01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:23.080]
No, the Cuban flag and the port of Rican flag are similar so they get confused a lot.

[01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:26.080]
But all my years in Miami I've seen one Cuban flag from a rear remuiler.

[01:04:26.080 --> 01:04:28.000]
You've seen one Cuban flag, I've seen a lot more than that.

[01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:28.740]
The rest of the port of Rican's.

[01:04:28.740 --> 01:04:29.100]
Even lately.

[01:04:29.640 --> 01:04:29.960]
Yeah.

[01:04:30.180 --> 01:04:32.960]
And how about the Rosary beads hanging, all the Chachkis hanging from there?

[01:04:33.220 --> 01:04:33.860]
Those are the big paradise.

[01:04:34.220 --> 01:04:34.700]
Those are Cubans.

[01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:37.620]
And then the dogs, the eyes moving in the back in the rear-view...

[01:04:37.620 --> 01:04:38.200]
Those are Mexicans.

[01:04:38.420 --> 01:04:38.560]
Oh.

[01:04:39.220 --> 01:04:40.260]
Oh, I didn't know they had a car.

[01:04:40.440 --> 01:04:41.620]
Maybe they ought to use the metro rail.

[01:04:42.220 --> 01:04:43.680]
Let's go to a Riviera beach.

[01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:43.980]
Hello.

[01:04:45.300 --> 01:04:45.900]
Riviera somewhere.

[01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:46.500]
Hello.

[01:04:47.420 --> 01:04:47.740]
Gone?

[01:04:48.180 --> 01:04:49.200]
Well, too damn bad.

[01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:50.760]
They didn't know where the hell they were.

[01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:52.000]
We have an open line on the green line.

[01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:53.440]
One, trivel eight, nine, four, nine.

[01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:55.220]
That really is the kick in the push, huh?

[01:04:56.300 --> 01:04:58.580]
Riviera Beach, one of those real hot shots up there.

[01:04:58.700 --> 01:04:59.560]
Here's Boka.

[01:04:59.920 --> 01:05:00.300]
Hello.

[01:05:01.780 --> 01:05:02.180]
Boka.

[01:05:02.540 --> 01:05:02.920]
Yes, sir.

[01:05:06.780 --> 01:05:08.680]
Happy all request, thank you for giving you.

[01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:09.100]
Yeah.

[01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:09.900]
Back to you.

[01:05:10.100 --> 01:05:11.380]
I got a shameless request.

[01:05:11.380 --> 01:05:12.960]
I thought it was Steve Nichol.

[01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:13.900]
What is it?

[01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:15.100]
A shameless request.

[01:05:15.380 --> 01:05:16.440]
It's not going to take any work.

[01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:16.880]
Okay.

[01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:18.660]
It's cart number 30.

[01:05:20.180 --> 01:05:21.240]
Cart number 30?

[01:05:21.460 --> 01:05:22.000]
Yes, sir.

[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:22.480]
We don't have any.

[01:05:22.520 --> 01:05:23.760]
We don't have any numbered carts.

[01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:25.140]
Oh, you did in the past.

[01:05:25.140 --> 01:05:25.700]
I'm Wemenia.

[01:05:25.700 --> 01:05:26.400]
No, we didn't.

[01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:27.080]
I'm Wemenia.

[01:05:27.220 --> 01:05:29.020]
Never had any numbered carts.

[01:05:29.100 --> 01:05:30.360]
The carts are always alphabet type.

[01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:31.960]
They're like, we just with labels.

[01:05:32.300 --> 01:05:32.920]
With names.

[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:34.720]
What is it?

[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:35.640]
I'm Wemenia.

[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:38.140]
Oh, Elmer Fud.

[01:05:38.820 --> 01:05:39.660]
Oh, you're tall.

[01:05:39.900 --> 01:05:41.140]
I know why you keep saying 30s.

[01:05:41.220 --> 01:05:42.980]
He's talking about like disc number 30 from the,

[01:05:43.100 --> 01:05:44.440]
okay, I'll find a Weemaway.

[01:05:44.680 --> 01:05:46.280]
I appreciate it, Neil.

[01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:49.240]
I'd like to dedicate it to Iber and Streeter from King and Koehback

[01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:49.720]
if I can.

[01:05:49.900 --> 01:05:50.140]
Okay.

[01:05:50.340 --> 01:05:50.880]
Thank you, Neil.

[01:05:51.020 --> 01:05:51.300]
See ya.

[01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:52.560]
Okay.

[01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:54.700]
Now, see now we got the problem, George.

[01:05:54.940 --> 01:05:56.520]
Now we got this disc problem.

[01:05:56.600 --> 01:05:57.880]
Anybody out there got a disc problem?

[01:05:57.960 --> 01:05:59.100]
We'll find you a good counter-practor.

[01:05:59.660 --> 01:06:01.680]
We got a little bit of a disc problem, ladies and gentlemen,

[01:06:01.700 --> 01:06:03.960]
because we don't know which disc that beyond, huh?

[01:06:04.460 --> 01:06:05.320]
Give me a guest, George.

[01:06:05.560 --> 01:06:05.780]
What number?

[01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:06.880]
I say 11 myself.

[01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:07.340]
What did he say?

[01:06:07.380 --> 01:06:07.620]
I'm sorry.

[01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:08.420]
I was talking to Steve DeLie.

[01:06:08.420 --> 01:06:10.740]
The Elmer Fud, the Weemaway, whatever that thing is called.

[01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:11.620]
Nine.

[01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:13.360]
Nine.

[01:06:13.940 --> 01:06:14.840]
What do you speak in German now?

[01:06:15.420 --> 01:06:15.640]
Nine.

[01:06:16.260 --> 01:06:17.580]
I don't think youth really thinks so.

[01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:18.080]
How do I know?

[01:06:18.120 --> 01:06:19.140]
I put them all on there.

[01:06:19.660 --> 01:06:21.200]
Yeah, I can't inherit things.

[01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:22.420]
I'm going to go to the next day, night after night,

[01:06:22.580 --> 01:06:23.480]
working like a maniac.

[01:06:23.740 --> 01:06:24.480]
George came in here.

[01:06:24.540 --> 01:06:25.940]
Everybody came in here except Rick or course.

[01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:28.480]
And we worked like crazy to put this stuff on here.

[01:06:28.580 --> 01:06:30.260]
And then we find out this ain't no good.

[01:06:31.700 --> 01:06:33.100]
There's the rabbit sleeps tonight.

[01:06:33.380 --> 01:06:34.200]
Oh, that's it, ain't it?

[01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:34.780]
Yes it is.

[01:06:34.780 --> 01:06:35.860]
Oh my God, guess what?

[01:06:35.960 --> 01:06:36.780]
It's on this number 11.

[01:06:36.780 --> 01:06:38.240]
What a genius that Rogers is, huh?

[01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:53.420]
And the fall is the quiet fall is the rabbit sleeps tonight.

[01:06:55.240 --> 01:07:01.520]
I sneak wide off, I get him tied up, he needs to pale moonlight.

[01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:06.760]
Oh, my God is wetty, my hand is steady.

[01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:10.520]
I've got him in my sight.

[01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:14.760]
Don't want to kill him, just want to dwell him.

[01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:19.360]
I hope he's nice and tight, and sigh.

[01:07:19.900 --> 01:07:20.480]
Our humble way.

[01:07:20.680 --> 01:07:21.460]
Our humble way.

[01:07:21.700 --> 01:07:23.480]
Our humble way.

[01:07:23.740 --> 01:07:24.480]
Our humaime way.

[01:07:24.740 --> 01:07:25.540]
Our humble way.

[01:07:25.740 --> 01:07:26.540]
Our humble way.

[01:07:26.740 --> 01:07:29.600]
Our humble way.

[01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:31.040]
Our humble way.

[01:07:32.880 --> 01:07:33.540]
Our humaime way.

[01:07:33.540 --> 01:07:33.700]
Our humble way.

[01:07:33.900 --> 01:07:34.660]
Our humaime way.

[01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:36.580]
Our hum lines.

[01:07:36.580 --> 01:07:42.820]
my dipstick up on his whipstick and thank him for the dance.

[01:07:43.340 --> 01:07:50.920]
But he's no waitie, he's like Ned Bady in the riverance.

[01:07:50.920 --> 01:08:14.560]
As I we moe, I we moe, I we moe, I we moe, I we moe, I we moe, I we moe, I we moe, I we moe, I we moe, I we moe, I we moe, I we moe, I we moe, I we moe, I we moe, I we moe, I we moe, I we moe, I we moe, I we moe, I we moe, I we moe, I we moe, I we moe, I we moe, I we moe, I we moe, I we moe, I we moe, I we moe, I we moe, I we moe, I we moe, I we moe, I we moe, I we moe, I we moe, I we moe, I we moe, I we moe, I we moe, I we moe, I we moe, I we

[01:08:14.560 --> 01:08:18.100]
we a final rim shot on there, so to speak. 1127 at WIudia.

[01:08:18.240 --> 01:08:26.680]
It's really rare, she blew her kiss to the conductor. In the covers I would like to

[01:08:26.680 --> 01:08:27.700]
a f***ing chair.

[01:08:27.700 --> 01:08:35.160]
Seems New York is legal now to show the world you well in doubt

[01:08:35.160 --> 01:08:41.040]
The big apple is the place to let your puppies breathe

[01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:43.400]
I have no foreskin

[01:08:43.400 --> 01:08:47.700]
Stop this on a train rolling down the tracks

[01:08:47.700 --> 01:08:51.660]
Stop this on a train and you won't get no flags

[01:08:51.660 --> 01:08:55.700]
This train should get a triple X rating

[01:08:55.700 --> 01:08:59.860]
I've got so hot I started f***ing fading

[01:08:59.860 --> 01:09:03.460]
Stop this on a train it's given me the fist

[01:09:04.280 --> 01:09:07.700]
All the passengers are flashing me their t***s

[01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:12.080]
I'm getting a rise in my cotton doggers

[01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:16.200]
From all these girls flashing me their doggers

[01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:20.520]
So that must be going on in the metro rail

[01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:23.700]
One of the guys sounded so excited about all I think he wouldn't have cared about that sound

[01:09:23.700 --> 01:09:25.080]
I'm judging from the sound of his verse

[01:09:25.080 --> 01:09:27.620]
It's 1134 and it's WIODD's

[01:09:27.620 --> 01:09:30.340]
Bouses are great but boy after the first 20 or 30 they'll kill you

[01:09:30.340 --> 01:09:31.780]
And that's just in the morning

[01:09:31.780 --> 01:09:33.340]
Here's a lady in the gables

[01:09:33.340 --> 01:09:33.920]
Hello

[01:09:34.660 --> 01:09:35.240]
Hi New

[01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:35.900]
How you doing?

[01:09:36.260 --> 01:09:36.980]
Happy Thanksgiving

[01:09:36.980 --> 01:09:37.860]
Back to you

[01:09:37.860 --> 01:09:40.540]
I called you a couple weeks ago to reach your happy birthday

[01:09:40.540 --> 01:09:41.020]
Yeah

[01:09:41.020 --> 01:09:44.360]
I wanted to call you again to talk about the food bomb feel bad

[01:09:44.360 --> 01:09:45.720]
I didn't want to be a chronic call

[01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:48.340]
So that's one of the reasons why I didn't call you back

[01:09:48.340 --> 01:09:48.840]
Okay

[01:09:49.780 --> 01:09:52.660]
Did you watch the avalanche in the ranges game last night?

[01:09:52.660 --> 01:09:53.340]
No I did not

[01:09:53.340 --> 01:09:55.660]
Ah, they were talking about um...

[01:09:56.260 --> 01:09:57.520]
I saw the lowlights though

[01:09:57.520 --> 01:09:59.900]
I saw Patrick Frog letting in one goal after another

[01:09:59.900 --> 01:10:00.620]
He's slipping

[01:10:00.620 --> 01:10:01.140]
Good

[01:10:01.140 --> 01:10:03.960]
We have a great possibility when in the cup

[01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:05.840]
Yeah we're in first place in league

[01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:06.540]
How do you like that?

[01:10:06.700 --> 01:10:07.180]
I love it

[01:10:07.180 --> 01:10:08.940]
And we got two games in hand on the lanch

[01:10:08.940 --> 01:10:09.920]
I know, I know

[01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:13.000]
But did you hear if Colin Powell doesn't you know

[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.780]
Butch up they're going to replace them a possibility

[01:10:15.780 --> 01:10:17.800]
Coach Barry Melrose

[01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:18.620]
Colin Powell

[01:10:18.620 --> 01:10:20.560]
They said that they made light

[01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:21.220]
Colin Powell?

[01:10:21.220 --> 01:10:21.980]
Yeah

[01:10:21.980 --> 01:10:23.160]
Is the coach of the Rangers?

[01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:24.760]
Is it Colin Powell?

[01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:26.120]
I thought it was John Campbell

[01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:28.360]
I thought it was Colin Powell

[01:10:28.360 --> 01:10:29.340]
Colin Campbell

[01:10:29.340 --> 01:10:29.980]
I'm sorry

[01:10:29.980 --> 01:10:33.700]
Colin Powell has a slightly not much but just slightly darker complexion

[01:10:33.700 --> 01:10:34.040]
I know I know

[01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:35.320]
I can see how you could be confused

[01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:37.040]
I know, I know

[01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:37.240]
I know, I know

[01:10:37.240 --> 01:10:38.520]
He's got a Colin problem

[01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:39.220]
I'm sorry Neil

[01:10:39.220 --> 01:10:42.680]
But like they mentioned that the possibility is that Barry Melrose

[01:10:43.180 --> 01:10:44.940]
Alright boy they fit in like a glove

[01:10:44.940 --> 01:10:47.640]
I hate Barry Melrose and I hate the Rangers and I hate Wayne Gretzky

[01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:48.280]
I like it

[01:10:48.280 --> 01:10:48.680]
I know

[01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:49.720]
I love it

[01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:50.240]
I'm the expert

[01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:51.420]
Max made in purgatory

[01:10:51.800 --> 01:10:52.520]
Okay, Neil

[01:10:52.520 --> 01:10:53.940]
He's doing it with the food by the way

[01:10:53.940 --> 01:10:57.000]
I go to the game but I know you fit in Section 106

[01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:57.640]
Yes I do

[01:10:57.640 --> 01:10:59.400]
You mind if I come over and say hello to you?

[01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:00.200]
Why should I mind?

[01:11:00.240 --> 01:11:01.580]
Everybody comes by and says hi

[01:11:01.580 --> 01:11:02.460]
At least a few

[01:11:03.460 --> 01:11:05.980]
Well, I didn't want to bother you like before the game

[01:11:05.980 --> 01:11:08.080]
I usually get there to watch a practice at 630

[01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:08.600]
I'm there

[01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:10.440]
You mind if I stop by and say hello?

[01:11:10.580 --> 01:11:11.660]
I would love to see you briefly

[01:11:12.380 --> 01:11:12.860]
That's true

[01:11:12.860 --> 01:11:13.300]
Okay

[01:11:13.300 --> 01:11:14.380]
Thank you, happy Thanksgiving

[01:11:14.380 --> 01:11:15.040]
Back to you

[01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:15.820]
Bye-bye

[01:11:15.820 --> 01:11:18.740]
We have an open line in day 622

[01:11:18.740 --> 01:11:19.680]
So what do you got Joey?

[01:11:19.860 --> 01:11:21.280]
What do they, that was pretty quick

[01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:23.220]
Right down the old hersy highway

[01:11:24.740 --> 01:11:25.540]
We know me, love?

[01:11:26.120 --> 01:11:27.100]
We don't know me here

[01:11:27.100 --> 01:11:27.720]
They need to handle

[01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:29.460]
They're more meat than I can handle, wanna bet?

[01:11:29.900 --> 01:11:31.880]
Joey says he's got more meat there than I can handle

[01:11:31.880 --> 01:11:32.880]
Well, you're starting to get

[01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:33.880]
And what's with the hair now?

[01:11:33.940 --> 01:11:35.020]
Are you like doing your hair different?

[01:11:35.840 --> 01:11:37.840]
To cover up the fact that your face is falling in?

[01:11:38.540 --> 01:11:40.280]
If you know what I'm saying, he's got a whole new do now

[01:11:40.280 --> 01:11:41.760]
Since he got married, he's got a whole new

[01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:42.960]
Less dipty do in his duties

[01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:43.960]
Oh, less do?

[01:11:44.860 --> 01:11:45.960]
More talking, less do

[01:11:45.960 --> 01:11:47.560]
Here's a lady in the sunrise lake

[01:11:48.060 --> 01:11:49.600]
Oh my god, finally

[01:11:49.600 --> 01:11:50.640]
Yes ma'am

[01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:51.900]
You know, I was waiting for

[01:11:51.900 --> 01:11:53.040]
You know, I was waiting for Thanksgiving for God's sake

[01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:53.340]
Huh?

[01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:56.780]
I wanted to give you something to be thankful for, finally getting on a year

[01:11:56.780 --> 01:11:58.120]
I am so thankful

[01:11:59.340 --> 01:12:02.780]
Listen, I've been listening to you for, you know, 100 years

[01:12:02.780 --> 01:12:02.840]
100 years

[01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:03.600]
For the baby

[01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:03.980]
Right

[01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:09.700]
And I just wanted to call and thank you because you are one of the blessings in my life, Neil Rogers

[01:12:09.700 --> 01:12:11.020]
Well, how about that?

[01:12:11.380 --> 01:12:12.220]
You're saying something like that

[01:12:12.220 --> 01:12:14.780]
Everybody is so nice today, isn't this disgusting?

[01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:16.320]
It's a little disgusting

[01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:18.100]
But once a year you can handle it

[01:12:18.100 --> 01:12:19.020]
And also the stalking

[01:12:19.020 --> 01:12:19.280]
Yeah

[01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:22.140]
That's right, I don't know if you remember me, but last year at borders

[01:12:22.140 --> 01:12:23.420]
I kissed your ring

[01:12:23.420 --> 01:12:25.440]
Like I kneeled before you and kissed your ring

[01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:26.860]
Oh yeah, no, I don't

[01:12:26.860 --> 01:12:29.620]
Oh, god, Neil, I can't picture of it, it's one of your questions

[01:12:29.620 --> 01:12:31.220]
I don't remember what I had for dinner last night

[01:12:31.220 --> 01:12:33.440]
You're gonna ask me if I remember last year at borders?

[01:12:33.740 --> 01:12:36.580]
It's the sugar dammit, you gotta get off that sugar

[01:12:36.580 --> 01:12:39.840]
It is, I'm not on any sugar, I'm doing good, I've lost seven pounds

[01:12:40.380 --> 01:12:42.320]
Okay, well just keep it in the last week

[01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:45.800]
In a week and a half, I lost seven pounds, since I came back from my eating vacation in Rome

[01:12:46.840 --> 01:12:48.440]
Is mommy gonna try a test of you tonight?

[01:12:48.860 --> 01:12:50.820]
Don't worry about mommy, just mind your own business

[01:12:51.380 --> 01:12:52.100]
I'm concerned

[01:12:52.100 --> 01:12:53.380]
I'm doing great

[01:12:53.380 --> 01:12:55.220]
You know, I'm concerned for its upper seasons

[01:12:55.220 --> 01:12:58.380]
Because if you have another heart attack and die, then it'll be really boring on you

[01:12:58.380 --> 01:13:02.900]
Yeah, I'm not going anywhere, I'm staying alive for at least another 50 years just to piss everybody off

[01:13:02.900 --> 01:13:03.440]
Wonderful

[01:13:03.440 --> 01:13:06.740]
Listen, I just wanted to thank my husband for being such a great guy

[01:13:06.740 --> 01:13:09.040]
And he's out on the road right now coming back from a football game

[01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:11.360]
And if he got hurt, he might as well not even come home

[01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:12.680]
Because I can't handle that

[01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:14.160]
But what does that mean?

[01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:15.620]
Well, because sometimes he gets hurt

[01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:19.760]
He's playing a game, he gets injured, I don't want to deal with that

[01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:22.660]
Well that's always good excuse I'm going out to play a football game, we've heard that one before

[01:13:23.320 --> 01:13:25.040]
No, it's the annual 30 days

[01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:26.180]
Oh yeah, I believe it, yeah

[01:13:26.600 --> 01:13:30.400]
So one of the thank him on the air in front of God and you and everybody else

[01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:30.780]
Okay

[01:13:30.780 --> 01:13:32.160]
And if you as well and have a great Thanksgiving day

[01:13:32.160 --> 01:13:33.460]
In front of you, good

[01:13:33.860 --> 01:13:34.640]
Have a happy

[01:13:34.640 --> 01:13:35.260]
Oh yeah

[01:13:35.260 --> 01:13:35.820]
See ya

[01:13:35.820 --> 01:13:38.160]
Two open lines in date, 622-9463

[01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:40.360]
622-2WYD

[01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:53.860]
Boston Market, Boston, chicken, whatever the hell they are, okay?

[01:13:54.640 --> 01:13:58.040]
Boston Beans, Boston Baked, Boston Market, I got it

[01:13:58.040 --> 01:14:01.700]
So there's two salads over there which I'm not eating that and where's my meat?

[01:14:03.540 --> 01:14:04.420]
What do I want?

[01:14:04.880 --> 01:14:05.760]
Or what am I going to get?

[01:14:05.880 --> 01:14:06.880]
Is that the obvious question?

[01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:08.320]
Where's my meat?

[01:14:08.580 --> 01:14:08.920]
Exactly

[01:14:10.620 --> 01:14:11.340]
622-2WYD

[01:14:11.340 --> 01:14:12.760]
It's all request Thanksgiving day

[01:14:12.760 --> 01:14:15.180]
Today and tomorrow that's stupid lines Kansas City game

[01:14:15.180 --> 01:14:17.700]
Nobody wants to see that, it just started 1230

[01:14:17.700 --> 01:14:18.520]
I think the pre-

[01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:20.220]
Does the game start at 1230 of the pre-game?

[01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:21.860]
Let me just take a look at that so I can, huh?

[01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:23.880]
The game starts at 1230?

[01:14:24.980 --> 01:14:27.040]
Well I'll sit here and just do a play by play on the game

[01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:28.140]
Let's take a puke

[01:14:28.140 --> 01:14:30.400]
Yeah, 1230 that Chiefs and Lions

[01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:34.300]
Oh that's right, they have to do that because just in case that game runs real long

[01:14:34.300 --> 01:14:35.860]
Or goes into overtime God forbid

[01:14:35.860 --> 01:14:38.200]
They want to make sure there's plenty of leeway for the Fox people

[01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:40.980]
Because that's kind of a conspiracy. Oh that's Turkey, that's great

[01:14:40.980 --> 01:14:42.720]
But what about my meatloaf, huh?

[01:14:42.920 --> 01:14:45.820]
I see some beautiful looking turkey, some turkey breast no less

[01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:48.080]
Here's a Tamarack, hello

[01:14:48.900 --> 01:14:49.580]
Hello Neil

[01:14:49.580 --> 01:14:50.100]
Yes sir

[01:14:50.100 --> 01:14:51.340]
Happy Thanksgiving to you

[01:14:51.340 --> 01:14:51.760]
Thanks to you

[01:14:52.500 --> 01:14:54.960]
You know tomorrow's the busiest day of the year for shopping

[01:14:54.960 --> 01:14:56.520]
That is absolutely correct sir

[01:14:56.520 --> 01:14:59.700]
Most of all it's the busiest day of the year for hospitals and stomach aches

[01:14:59.700 --> 01:14:59.920]
Yeah

[01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:01.960]
Hey Neil, I got a lot of reports for you

[01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:02.420]
Okay

[01:15:02.420 --> 01:15:04.320]
Listen, I'm an independent career

[01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:07.920]
I can use my own vehicle for pickups and deliveries of packages, you know, etc.

[01:15:08.380 --> 01:15:11.320]
And I'm like on the beach in Surfside by like a 94th Street

[01:15:11.320 --> 01:15:12.680]
Where's my meat?

[01:15:12.900 --> 01:15:17.980]
And one of these wannabe metro parking christmas officers is like right behind me as I pull in a loading zone

[01:15:17.980 --> 01:15:19.680]
Four parking lanes long

[01:15:19.680 --> 01:15:21.760]
I put my career sign in the window

[01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:24.360]
Grab my clipboard and the box I'm dropping off

[01:15:24.360 --> 01:15:26.960]
Get in and out and back to my car within two minutes

[01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:31.780]
And this guy parking officer Assault W Perez is still right in the middle

[01:15:32.580 --> 01:15:33.020]
Oh

[01:15:33.020 --> 01:15:37.360]
A career who is loading and unloading all day in loading zones

[01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:39.900]
A parking they get for parking in loading zone

[01:15:39.900 --> 01:15:40.180]
Yeah

[01:15:41.640 --> 01:15:43.500]
They kinda can't be this hard up for money

[01:15:43.500 --> 01:15:44.240]
Don't do it again

[01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:46.420]
Okay, we have an open line of bri- what are you saying to me?

[01:15:46.500 --> 01:15:47.400]
There's no meatloaf in there

[01:15:47.400 --> 01:15:49.280]
Well, they didn't have any meatloaf

[01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:50.100]
They have everything fresh

[01:15:50.100 --> 01:15:52.220]
They won't get a bring me they got turkey and ham, okay

[01:15:53.320 --> 01:15:54.660]
I know I'm not gonna eat no vegetables

[01:15:54.660 --> 01:15:56.240]
Well, you can't have no vegetables on the weekends

[01:15:56.240 --> 01:15:58.360]
Is this guy dreaming or what?

[01:15:58.540 --> 01:16:00.540]
Oh, look at Adam's thumb, doesn't that look beautiful?

[01:16:01.160 --> 01:16:02.140]
It looks like a thumb

[01:16:02.140 --> 01:16:03.520]
What? What is in there?

[01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:05.380]
What is it?

[01:16:06.940 --> 01:16:07.440]
Honey, honey

[01:16:07.440 --> 01:16:09.520]
Now see, I can't have no honey glazed anything

[01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:11.580]
I can't have that

[01:16:12.380 --> 01:16:14.760]
How about if you just eat the inside and not the glazed outside?

[01:16:15.580 --> 01:16:16.720]
Oh yeah, right

[01:16:17.100 --> 01:16:19.780]
That's like saying, how about if we bring you like 20 pounds of

[01:16:19.780 --> 01:16:23.780]
Entomans donuts and you just eat the whole thing?

[01:16:24.420 --> 01:16:25.340]
Do I want what?

[01:16:25.900 --> 01:16:27.840]
Yeah, I'll have some of that dry turkey there

[01:16:27.840 --> 01:16:29.940]
Whatever that is, okay, well, this is...

[01:16:29.940 --> 01:16:32.080]
You know, we thank these people real a lot, you know

[01:16:32.080 --> 01:16:33.340]
But this is pretty...

[01:16:33.340 --> 01:16:34.920]
Let me take a look at it

[01:16:34.920 --> 01:16:37.940]
I have never seen anybody pochki around so much in my life

[01:16:37.940 --> 01:16:38.880]
My God

[01:16:39.520 --> 01:16:42.840]
I don't just want to look at the meat, I want it in my hands

[01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:44.800]
Mmm

[01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:47.020]
It's not dry at all

[01:16:47.580 --> 01:16:49.760]
It's moist, it's tender, it's delicious

[01:16:50.780 --> 01:16:51.140]
Mmm

[01:16:51.140 --> 01:16:52.960]
The turkey and the turkey too

[01:16:53.760 --> 01:16:55.340]
Cornbread, I can't have no cornbread

[01:16:56.060 --> 01:16:59.220]
God, they said all kinds of good stuff for Adam and Joey and George

[01:17:00.220 --> 01:17:01.500]
Too bad Wayne left so early

[01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:02.960]
For him

[01:17:03.620 --> 01:17:04.000]
Mmm

[01:17:04.500 --> 01:17:06.320]
Thanks a lot again guys, this is beautiful

[01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:07.860]
Too bad I can't eat that ham

[01:17:07.860 --> 01:17:10.500]
Of course that wouldn't be cause you're not eating ham, Adam are you?

[01:17:10.820 --> 01:17:12.760]
Adam's eating the ham, he's going straight to hell

[01:17:13.660 --> 01:17:14.040]
Oi

[01:17:15.300 --> 01:17:16.460]
Here's a Davy, hello

[01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:17.900]
Hello

[01:17:17.900 --> 01:17:19.560]
Next thing you'll be getting cheese in there, yes?

[01:17:19.980 --> 01:17:20.540]
Hello, Neil

[01:17:20.540 --> 01:17:21.020]
Yes sir

[01:17:21.020 --> 01:17:22.940]
Yeah, this is Joe and Davy, how are you doing?

[01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:23.600]
Okay, Joe

[01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:26.100]
Hey, remember about a year or so ago

[01:17:26.100 --> 01:17:30.180]
In Tamarack they had that law about tumid

[01:17:31.400 --> 01:17:33.660]
Some of them stiff even though you're dressed

[01:17:33.660 --> 01:17:35.880]
Turgent, not tumid, turgent

[01:17:35.880 --> 01:17:38.980]
Turgent, yeah, if you have something tumid in your pants

[01:17:38.980 --> 01:17:40.660]
Right, well guess what happened to you guys

[01:17:40.660 --> 01:17:41.840]
Humid, not tumid, humid

[01:17:41.840 --> 01:17:44.780]
If it's turgent and humid man, you're in big trouble

[01:17:44.780 --> 01:17:46.680]
Guess what happened, I don't drive you guys

[01:17:46.680 --> 01:17:47.240]
What's that?

[01:17:47.520 --> 01:17:50.100]
The Oscar Mara Wiener Mumbio was headed north

[01:17:50.100 --> 01:17:50.480]
Yeah

[01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:52.080]
And here comes the pegs, right?

[01:17:52.380 --> 01:17:53.380]
They pull him over

[01:17:53.380 --> 01:17:55.860]
The driver's trying to get the car cover out

[01:17:55.860 --> 01:17:57.820]
Because the Oscar Mara Wiener was too turgent

[01:17:57.820 --> 01:17:59.400]
Right, and it wasn't limping up

[01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:01.240]
Listen, they were trying to cover up, right?

[01:18:01.580 --> 01:18:03.260]
And it ain't happening, okay?

[01:18:03.300 --> 01:18:05.900]
Here comes the cop, there was a Japanese cop

[01:18:05.900 --> 01:18:07.720]
with a metric tape, whatever you call it

[01:18:07.720 --> 01:18:09.820]
And he's maging it, probably for the ticket

[01:18:09.820 --> 01:18:12.100]
to make sure you know they get the most out of it

[01:18:12.100 --> 01:18:12.280]
Yeah

[01:18:12.280 --> 01:18:14.140]
And then there was American cop was there

[01:18:14.140 --> 01:18:16.400]
And they were arguing about which way to write the ticket

[01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:18.200]
Well guess who pulls up behind

[01:18:19.660 --> 01:18:20.460]
Jim Mandage

[01:18:20.460 --> 01:18:21.560]
No, Sally Fitz

[01:18:21.560 --> 01:18:22.260]
Yeah

[01:18:22.260 --> 01:18:23.740]
One to know if there was a...

[01:18:23.740 --> 01:18:25.860]
Okay, we have two open lines in Broward, 767

[01:18:25.860 --> 01:18:27.980]
After all of that, we get to this ridiculous story

[01:18:27.980 --> 01:18:30.940]
Pal, I got news for, your material is worse than lunch

[01:18:30.940 --> 01:18:33.160]
No, lunch is great, the turkey is good

[01:18:33.160 --> 01:18:34.760]
Little on the, you know, it's moist

[01:18:35.880 --> 01:18:38.760]
But it's, what are you laughing about?

[01:18:38.780 --> 01:18:39.500]
What's in gravy on it?

[01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:41.400]
What do you mean it's got gravy on it?

[01:18:41.400 --> 01:18:42.680]
I said you could put some gravy on it

[01:18:42.680 --> 01:18:43.100]
What gravy?

[01:18:43.340 --> 01:18:43.800]
We got gravy?

[01:18:44.060 --> 01:18:45.300]
I'm sure we have gravy, Joey

[01:18:45.820 --> 01:18:46.460]
You asshole

[01:18:46.460 --> 01:18:48.240]
Yeah, but what's in the gravy though?

[01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:50.240]
It's probably like cornstarch and crap in there

[01:18:50.240 --> 01:18:50.980]
that I can't eat

[01:18:51.720 --> 01:18:54.260]
I'm not gonna drop the gravy all over the board, are you crazy?

[01:18:55.280 --> 01:18:57.620]
Oh yeah, you can tell by how, oh boy

[01:18:58.460 --> 01:19:02.700]
I can tell looking right through the cover that this gravy's got all kinds of carbohydrates in it

[01:19:02.700 --> 01:19:04.880]
It is loaded with mung

[01:19:04.880 --> 01:19:08.800]
If I can get the damn top off of this stupid thing which I don't want to spill it all over the board

[01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:09.780]
Because I don't want to get

[01:19:09.780 --> 01:19:10.800]
Pro, pro, pro

[01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:11.460]
I said

[01:19:11.980 --> 01:19:14.740]
Yeah, see if you can know, you're gonna spill it, I'm telling you that right now, mister

[01:19:16.060 --> 01:19:19.560]
I'm telling you right now, man, your career is gonna be very short-lied

[01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:22.900]
First it brings in that real crappy version of smoke this in the morning

[01:19:23.820 --> 01:19:26.060]
You said it was gonna be great, it sucked

[01:19:26.060 --> 01:19:29.340]
We have an open line in Broward, 7679463

[01:19:29.340 --> 01:19:31.900]
It's 1144 at WIOD

[01:19:31.900 --> 01:19:35.580]
Hardaway left one, left side line Marley 3.0

[01:19:35.580 --> 01:19:39.340]
Oh, he hit it

[01:19:39.340 --> 01:19:41.800]
Oh, he hit it

[01:19:41.800 --> 01:19:44.040]
Oh, he hit it

[01:19:44.560 --> 01:19:48.040]
I don't mean that was a 3, I mean that was from the moon

[01:19:48.040 --> 01:19:52.460]
From the moon from his restaurant about three blocks from here
