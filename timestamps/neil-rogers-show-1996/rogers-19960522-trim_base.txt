[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.300]
And near my queen, God.

[00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:17.620]
All the spigs are brown, out here in LA.

[00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:26.580]
I've been sharing for a while, and I plan to stay.

[00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.380]
So why won't hesitate to close this day?

[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.080]
Love you, if your name is Jose.

[00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:44.440]
California's screaming, it happens in LA.

[00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.880]
If you cross the border, or you'll touch on you,

[00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.060]
you'll pay to touch on you.

[00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.880]
I'll make you get down on your name, on your knees.

[00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.940]
But you won't have time to pray, won't have time to pray.

[00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:10.300]
You'll be too busy getting by to the end, but tell you won't walk away.

[00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.640]
You won't walk away.

[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:19.340]
California's screaming, it happens in LA.

[00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.800]
It happens in LA.

[00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.160]
It happens in LA.

[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:28.360]

[00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.100]
So happy what day is this Wednesday.

[00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:34.240]
We're the hell of Spencer.

[00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.060]
Oh, Spencer right here today, because it was raining.

[00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.840]
He show up today.

[00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.500]
The sun is shining, no Spencer.

[00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.340]
Grab a mic over there, Rick.

[00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:44.220]
What?

[00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.960]
Thanks.

[00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.520]
I thought you had a special announcement.

[00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.880]
Yeah.

[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.840]
Yeah.

[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:49.280]
Yeah.

[00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:50.680]
No, it's this one.

[00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:51.460]
Try that.

[00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:52.260]
Try that.

[00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.740]
Hello.

[00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:53.520]
Oh, okay.

[00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.720]
Hello.

[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:54.080]
Hello.

[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.240]
Test.

[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:55.100]
Give me the off one.

[00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.080]
What do you mean by that?

[00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.440]
So we just had a little meeting across the street, and I guess we better tell you before.

[00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.540]
It wasn't a hair that Barry Jackson boy.

[00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.900]
This little pimple had that fat little putts.

[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.420]
You know, he just takes stuff that he hears rumors on the streets.

[00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:12.160]
He listens to the show incessantly, which I know you're listening now.

[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.780]
Barry, your fat little slob.

[00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.380]
And he writes an article in a paper about it in the business section.

[00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.940]
There's a sports turd, and he's writing in the business section in the herald.

[00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.820]
There's a little more than what he heard on the radio in here, though.

[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.280]
What?

[00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.960]
As in, have been summoned to a mandatory 830 AM meeting.

[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.480]
Yeah.

[00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.160]
Well, that wasn't heard on the radio.

[00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.580]
That was, came from a little.

[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.280]
In some other words, you say there was like a little.

[00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.660]
Sorry.

[00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.800]
Oh.

[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:40.280]
Close the complete.

[00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.580]
Ha ha ha.

[00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.460]
Had it drawn to right under floor and so anyway, I guess everybody's dying to know what was said at the meeting this morning.

[00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.020]
actually transcript, that's it.

[00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.620]
Now, who was that talking?

[00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:59.960]
Well, we don't want to get into that.

[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.560]
No, exactly.

[00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.040]
Yeah, we had a little meeting this morning.

[00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.420]
W.I.O.D. has been sold, which of course it's still got to go through the FCC.

[00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.540]
you see whatever those letters stand for but uh... you know as of today we're

[00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.860]
still uh... being paid by Cox we're still working for Cox

[00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.400]
as of today yeah

[00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.820]
and about three months that's gonna change when we're working for a buddy but

[00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:18.480]
paxon

[00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.340]
our good close personal friend seem like a great guy didn't he

[00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.980]
hey listen he remembered me from uh... from saras odyssey to my even pay

[00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.140]
of that one eighty bucks

[00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.980]
and he owes such fifty we've got to bring it up which that's about three weeks

[00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.980]
pay for him exactly did bring it up

[00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.660]
while he said last time i saw you you were saying that that we don't see

[00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.560]
you later get out of my place and he said you remember that snake you saw

[00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.760]
from a y and d that last sunday that was no accident the last that's great

[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.540]
it's gonna be nice working for you

[00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:49.080]
so anyway we're gonna be a uh... paxon station which that's the way the business

[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.120]
is going you know he said something very uh... intriguing over there very

[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.640]
disturbing

[00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.440]
and that is that in orlando there are three companies that own with the

[00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.100]
exception of one there's one guy that's like the odd man out

[00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.800]
because he if they bought him he'd be over the right

[00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:06.460]
three companies on all the amfm stations in orlando only market the whole

[00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:08.340]
country where they happen so far

[00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:09.080]
to be a far

[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.640]
and so like i've said that your government is really interested in protecting

[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.840]
the airwaves we can't say crap more than once an hour on the air we can only

[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.180]
take one once every two hours

[00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.200]
but uh... you know if a handful of companies want to buy every guy damn radio

[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.840]
station in the country that's okay

[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:24.200]
i mean that that's

[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.420]
see i don't care what anybody says that i'm not talking about any specific

[00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:28.540]
a company that's bad

[00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.400]
because that goes that goes so far away from what the original concept was of

[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.600]
serving the public good and getting diverse ownership and having a whole

[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.740]
bunch of different people owning the airwaves instead of having just a

[00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.760]
limited number of people controlling like some big propaganda machine

[00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.940]
every piece of crap that comes out on the airways and radio television

[00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.060]
it used to be that radio stations were licensed to serve the public and the

[00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.320]
commercials are now basically what it's boiled down with like baseball cards

[00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.220]
i said that the other day it's like we used to do when we were kids going out in

[00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:00.760]
the backyard and everybody had a big stack of baseball cards and we would

[00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.640]
flip them and we would trade them and that's what radio stations have been like

[00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:06.440]
now that's the nature of the business and of course you can't blame the people

[00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.600]
who are in it because they're in it for one reason that's to make money that's

[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.440]
the one thing i've been telling you folks for the last 20 years don't think we're

[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.560]
here to entertain you baby we're here to make money if we can you know if we can

[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.300]
give you a couple of laughs along the way give you some information whatever it is

[00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.200]
kill a few hours that's great but we're here to make a book

[00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.360]
so you can't blame the people that are in it to make a book but you blame the

[00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:28.100]
goddamn government for turning it into a uh... uh... a trading card thing

[00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:30.000]
which is basically what it is

[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:35.220]
so what did i just say i don't know what it may take a very well i think i did

[00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:38.800]
very well because i think we haven't uh... having to be put in this position of

[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.820]
that i'm always the one they always do things right before ten o'clock and i

[00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:46.560]
see it to bob niel is we're crossing the street i said okay why don't you go on

[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:50.060]
here mr. smarty pants and you say your thing because here we are

[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:55.400]
well don't say this and don't do that and but by and have a big smile on your face

[00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.520]
and let's have a and then bob green of course comes up with his usual great

[00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.060]
line have a good time

[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:02.520]
the path through

[00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:07.400]
yes matter fact he was just on his way in shut in the door he was on his way and

[00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.260]
i thought i heard the sounds of a bad bout of diarrhea there is what i heard

[00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.800]
i got to look up that word marketing though they mentioned so the bottom line

[00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:17.740]
is we're still here we're still a do what our thing and w i d will not the change

[00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:22.260]
so they tell us so they tell us so they tell us and we're still going to you

[00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.060]
know say crap and taking occasional one

[00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:28.560]
when you chow cheese oh that's right you weren't here okay i'm sorry sorry about

[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.700]
that you weren't in here i was waiting to come in here and done that now he's a

[00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:35.860]
good one to blame so anyway let's take a little break i have no idea what i'm

fn uh... in fact you're just gonna have to say the baseball game is on it anyway uh... there's

[00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:43.820]
no game tonight we're not playing again till friday oh christ will be but you just put your

[00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:47.100]
you just put your finger on it the reason that there's no panther game tonight is because

[00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:52.060]
he s pn is manipulating all the weekday games weeknight games and because they got Monday night

[00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:55.420]
i mean Wednesday night baseball they couldn't play the night and then they couldn't play tomorrow

[00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:58.800]
because of a rena's good showing so we're not playing our first home game to all friday we get

[00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:04.000]
nice rest now uh... friday and then sunday afternoon not a good thing you want to get the tempo up

[00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:46.840]
seventy five yes sir i bet we can't wait to the uh or hey cranking that 1962 mac truck up to about

[00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:53.460]
seventy five miles an hour now unbelievable oh they did the thing with the speed limit

[00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:57.740]
well you saw i think i think i just i know they're covering the signs covered now what but i

[00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:02.440]
didn't know what it is so i just go 90 now i just thought i saw like a half of a seven and a

[00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:07.980]
zero it's gonna be 70 it's gonna be 70 and then i see where it used to be 55 it's gonna be 60

[00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:13.300]
exactly right there already unwrap that one well those should have been 90 a long time ago on that

[00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:18.740]
thing oh boy the wheels are gonna be falling off now yeah just get right behind that gravel trucker

[00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:22.060]

[00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:33.000]
if pax was right he's about what he said fatal care that's not in serisona besides that

[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.800]
what i love care who won't you look like like i've always said when people started about wane or

[00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:42.600]
about this one or miki iris and of course i'm not that crazy about miki but the bottom line is

[00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:47.920]
nobody goes to a sporting event because they like the owner people that go to see the reds play

[00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:52.080]
they don't go because they like marge shot head people i listen to the station doles and because

[00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:57.700]
they like cocks well uh cocks broadcasting that is so i'd be surprised if you got five calls

[00:17:57.700 --> 00:18:02.620]
concerning this today it's business is usual you're here they're happy it's getting calls in

[00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:06.860]
there well people in a business over there say i keep hanging up on the court i'll compete for you

[00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:10.360]
didn't call us yet and then welcome us to the uh the paxing family

[00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:16.300]
huh how come mr. ego didn't call yet and say welcome i think it was that line checker on line

[00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:22.360]
five that keeps calling him oh that's bolder yeah yeah he won't be doing that no more okay so it's just

[00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:26.580]
they don't care that there's nothing else going on you got t-shirts the panthers are coming

[00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:30.820]
back to town for the playoffs yeah it goes on and i got my tickets from what he has today and we're

[00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:34.960]
not changing anything as of 10 30 and 20 what he was the operative word when he came in here and

[00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:40.120]
i saw those tickets i'd get one if i had some but you don't i don't now i got to go talk to

[00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:44.480]
Bob green now that i don't work for him anymore maybe he'll you do work for him for another three

[00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:48.720]
months or so well see that's uh figure a speech uh see i know when have you ever been put in that

[00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:54.000]
position i don't like that see the one the one good part about it in recent history what they do is

[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:59.380]
they have these local marketing agreements it's called an lma and when a station is sold the two

[00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:04.340]
companies that make the deal of the new company gets an lma and they agreed to run the station

[00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:08.660]
at least to a certain point until the fcc approves the deal which now takes about three months

[00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:13.580]
and then then and by that time then you're like kind of eased into whatever's going to be going on

[00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:18.360]
now we're still under the one banner head anyway you know it's kind of like a lame duck thing here

[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.560]
plus the fact that next time Bob greens is a you know that show this more you just go

[00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:28.880]
like that that's all you got to hey you're a walking rectum Bob that's uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh

[00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:32.620]
yeah something like that what's wrong with that well see they won't even notice any difference

[00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:38.680]
yeah that's true that's a good point so we're not going now do you want to go well it's i

[00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:43.220]
enjoy standing i feel like i need the aliche on me something you know i have a new line

[00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:47.880]
i just uh i know well it's kind of a shocking thing and then to stick my ass on the ear here

[00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:52.960]
afterward like i'm the old pro you know like i'm some kind of a uh this is not good i don't mean

[00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:56.420]
that the deal isn't good but although it might not be you've told them everything but the whole what

[00:19:56.420 --> 00:19:59.620]
you've told them everything yeah that's that's all right there's nothing else to tell we know

[00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:04.060]
all right i forgot to tell him because he's a bud's holding a presscon my good buddy bud right

[00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:08.380]
uh it is holding a press conference it uh hey listen i'm easy if they the paychecks are good

[00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:12.360]
at 11 o'clock this morning uh 13 million dollars they bought the station for

[00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:15.880]
which seems to me like an awfully low figure doesn't it i would think

[00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:20.600]
didn't they just pay like 57 million for she wasn't that the deal yeah but they must have been making

[00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:27.880]
money oh but 13 million sounds like an awfully low number doesn't it yeah everybody else

[00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:31.520]
i don't talk to the guy huh unless there's something else going on that doesn't meet everybody

[00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:22.600]
to do with that are you no we're well uh i don't know we're going to be in their new building which

[00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:25.800]
they're erecting if i can say that it's going to be done in a few months and it's going to be up

[00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:31.540]
by four forty one and what skylight mall he said skylight uh my my my garden what do you laugh

[00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:38.080]
about it's a lot better than here brand new can be all digital oh yeah you on the toll too

[00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:43.340]
and if they install any tape machines for playbacks wouldn't like best of i'm a toll on what

[00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:51.340]
uh the turnpike there's turnpike exit at the stadium you could take that yeah oh that's a good

[00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:56.060]
so who cares about the toll when you're making the big bucks uh when you're at least still employed

[00:22:56.060 --> 00:23:00.200]
well that's why they probably like pay 13 million because with the real estate that property would

[00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:04.540]
have been lot more i would think yeah i could have gone up to three two one i never thought that's

[00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:08.460]
right i never thought about that they're also dumping off this building that right excellent you're

[00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:12.180]
lots smarter than we are oh well because uh cox is dumping off this building which is going to be

[00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:16.640]
worth at least another four hundred thousand oh easily easily well listen i wish you well and i

[00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:21.460]
hope they don't mess with it but i guess history has proved well what do you think you're all you're

[00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:26.200]
all experts out there you're all amateur program directors what like the one we got there's only one

[00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:31.220]
other thing they need to eliminate from your station yeah perfect the sports programming yeah but

[00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:36.980]
these people are very smart oriented hey look more of it oh look for a lot of sports yeah one station

[00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:41.440]
with that entertainment one is one station with news yeah we're gonna be the sports dudes in the

[00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:51.020]
morning no no hey they love sports good to do sports on that station okay yeah i think you

[00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:58.720]
got a good point okay pal i will find a go panthers oh we have an open line of brow art oh god at five

[00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:03.240]
two four nine four six three i'm all choked up i really am by neckestiff i feel like Linda Blair

[00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:07.000]
will be all right this is going to be a great thing just keep saying it it's going to be great it's

[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.660]
going to be great it's going to be great right on the blackboard four hundred times could you smile

[00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:16.140]
when you say that it'd be a little more convincing yeah but we're on radio okay so anyway uh well

[00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:21.420]
of course they put us be you know just just keep one thing in mind i'm uncomfortable with this just

[00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:27.520]
no i'm i'm i'm i'm uncomfortable being on a year with uh with rigid guidelines in other words i

[00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:31.580]
can abide by realistic guidelines but when you know you got to have to be careful what you say about

[00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:36.000]
this company and then the other company uh as far as i'm concerned now even though they're not

[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:39.280]
saying in our paychecks and even though this company still owns this place and they're calling

[00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:43.360]
the shots we work for packs and now that's where our league is not that i'm too faced or anything

[00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:48.080]
like that so when some little twirpy guys is to me be nice to us why because you got a paycheck

[00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:52.040]
coming tomorrow good point i like this company you know what it's like i like Cox it's like one

[00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:56.120]
comes out of secret it's like one company says don't talk about any of this any other company says

[00:24:56.120 --> 00:25:00.540]
and arrest that stuff you're going to talk about don't talk about any of that right but just go

[00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:04.660]
on a year and do you have a great show yeah and have a good time doing it i'm having a good time

[00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:07.960]

[00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:18.020]
to tell you before just keep this in mind yeah just keep this in the top of your cranium and that is

[00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:22.800]

[00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:44.240]
something like that yeah and it didn't happen i mean everything's normal pretty nobody you

[00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:49.900]
said we were all gonna disappear well i was i didn't know what to think i mean i didn't know

[00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:55.480]
it took three months for things to happen you know with the FCC yeah thank god it was all a little

[00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:58.920]
further close on in other words you think in three months were all gonna disappear is that it i

[00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:03.060]
hope not i don't think so i love you guys well i'll tell you this much that they certainly wouldn't

[00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:07.140]
have assumed our contracts which uh in some cases happened to run into significant amount of cash

[00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:11.080]
if they that no no seriously if they plan on blowing us out in three months what would have been

[00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:17.020]
the point of that no it's pretty dumb they're buying iod because they like it

[00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:21.200]
they got the money yeah because we're in because we're in oh you're the you're the

[00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:25.000]
when it comes to a m everybody else is doing ones and twos we're sitting here with numbers y'all

[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:31.600]
the boss with the hot sauce exactly exactly what else i picked up lady marathons pretty happy

[00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:35.560]
y'all ain't going remember that lady marathons well that's right all you people that were calling

[00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:39.320]
belly that's a very good point the people that were calling belly it can yesterday screaming

[00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:43.200]
caring on about you're not going to be able to hear us anymore up there in uh

[00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:47.780]
where we're in how they were in marathon and up in uh viro and uh all those red necks up there

[00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:52.160]
all indos uh you still got us now whether you like it or not and of course i said here yesterday

[00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:55.900]
telling you that a m radio was like nickers and it was out and of course buddy bud told us this

[00:28:55.900 --> 00:29:00.220]
morning a m is great it's a great medium and i had to do agree with them i think i think

[00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:07.640]
i think i think you were mistaken yesterday we all we all make we make premature evacuations

[00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:12.400]
that's what mario said the other and we just uh you know spoke too soon a m's where it's at

[00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:15.380]
that's right even those pickers got an a m radio and they're old pickup

[00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:21.280]
that's sure right not everybody can afford a fancy high-floot and fm that's right thank god

[00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:26.220]
right anyway i thought that's what i said yesterday you better be sending us a whole mark card

[00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:31.540]
oh god well anyway how about one of them t-shirts now oh sure no problem all right you'll love it

[00:29:31.540 --> 00:29:36.280]
thanks man okay hang on uh lion six send that uh y'all who one of these are gonna have a dozen of

[00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:41.400]
these damn panther things they say beware panther country and they got the rats and though there's a

[00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:45.720]
big one there and they're like parachuting in baby by the way there's a toll lady blonde toll

[00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:49.940]
lady at the glades who you've probably seen who's got a rat posted this morning she's a nice lady

[00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:55.540]
she always has a good morning sign that had the um the night after the last win against uh

[00:29:56.160 --> 00:30:00.940]
filanofia the uh sixth game she's the one that had the uh get cup crazy sign on air and had her

[00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:06.400]
panther flag sticking out the uh her thing she's the best yeah rat up this morning she had a

[00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:12.400]
rat up her thing oh yeah maybe it was a rat tail whatever happened with that by the way today

[00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:16.760]
ever contact us uh since we gave them such nice coverage here we gave out their phone number the

[00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:24.220]
rat tail people they didn't are they cellinos yeah there's cellinos damn things and they said the

[00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:28.240]
first two hundred bucks goes to the Jimmy Rice Fund and the yadda yadda yadda and uh that was the

[00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:32.700]
and so i finally broke down to give their number they're probably too busy taking orders right now

[00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:36.260]
they don't have time to call and say hey we got a ton of uh i don't know if anybody wants those

[00:30:36.260 --> 00:30:41.280]
i mean do those really look like rat tails to you they'll put on anything nobody listens to

[00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:46.260]
the show anymore anyway so you know we don't yeah no they you know they're good enough i thought

[00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:50.800]
when i saw them that they would go and you said add don't never catch on yeah i bet they do

[00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:56.900]
by the way can i tell you the only person out of all the rumors the only per he won't mind my

[00:30:56.900 --> 00:31:01.260]
saying this because he's a professional yadda anyway that gave me the correct information and he

[00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:06.980]
had just heard it out on the street like at a bus stop somewhere was rimmer really yeah yeah our

[00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:12.180]
overnight guy was so far off and everybody else who's got us buying this and going over night guy

[00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:17.800]
just to see what's going on well that's true but but he has a good feel for things

[00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:24.820]
no seriously all that crap about uh fm so so the bottom line it's kind of strange too because you

[00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:29.840]
realize now that within the building for those who've never been in the building which is almost all

[00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:35.840]
of you we have the three radio stations the two fm's in the a m right you said we up and uh us them

[00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:42.800]
up and down the hallway so now hot 105 and the coast they're staying as cocks properties they're not

[00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:47.600]
going nowhere because they love did i tell you that's what cocks loves is fm right they love those

[00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:52.420]
music jukeboxes that's how they know uh make their money make a lot of money don't make any trouble

[00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:58.320]
right and so we're here too in the same building for at least uh well that's going to be

[00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:02.560]
interesting too because even after the ownership change comes through we're still going to be here for

[00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:05.840]
a while because he said about eight or nine months before the new buildings done they got some

[00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:10.380]
neat stuff down there that's good work we're like to step children of this building right and tip the

how he indicated me if he's grown any boy there must be a so-and-to pair of pants together room he's

[00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:38.440]
grown i didn't hate Rick yeah you did no you didn't like me got me fired i didn't get you fired

[00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:41.920]
that's because that's just because you were black don't take it personally yeah it wasn't anything

[00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:46.640]
you did it's just because you're skin color right uh oh don't say that he didn't like the haircut

[00:35:48.340 --> 00:35:52.560]
so let me ask you this now has everybody over there known about this for some time or do you

[00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:57.380]
just get the word or how does uh get broken down to you you're going to find out in the future that

[00:35:57.820 --> 00:36:02.540]
secrets are very well kept and they don't say anything until the last possible seconds so nobody

[00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:06.660]
here knew anything nobody here knew it either i mean nobody i mean even people that you would

[00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:11.560]
think would have to know nobody nobody knew anything everybody was paid off to keep their mouth shut

[00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:14.620]
the only one and like Rick just said the only guy in town i knew it was Barry Jackson

[00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:19.440]
which is a hell of a sad comment so what's the scuttle vote over there what's the reaction now

[00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:24.560]
that we're all going to be sucking out of the same trough some people are panicked yeah panicked about

[00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:30.200]
why i know how a radio people get they don't like change and some people are in vacation right now

[00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:37.020]
so they're upset because when you're in vacation just just just just just just tell me what your problem is

[00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:41.880]
so mr. came may call you later on today uh now you're getting carried away i mean i'm my 20th

[00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:45.660]
anniversary that was one thing i mean that was hard to swallow but uh you know let's let's take it

[00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:51.540]
slow let's ease into this nick it'll be fun why would you be panicked over there what changes could come

[00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:56.160]
i don't know right now i think everything is cool everything will be fine well let's get into some

[00:36:56.160 --> 00:37:01.700]
of those rumors because while our imagination has been stagnant the concern of you i'm sure that

[00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:05.060]
you probably have come up with your own we've got back to topics that's what it is

[00:37:05.060 --> 00:37:13.200]
everything that i know for sure is that everybody at ftl who's on the air today at 1057

[00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:19.560]
tomorrow right okay and everybody who's on io d today will be on the air tomorrow if they show up

[00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:24.380]
right that's right in the future holes that were going to all be one huge big building right

[00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:29.620]
and now let me ask you how can you guys also keep though and you don't ask me because they

[00:37:29.620 --> 00:37:34.140]

[00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:37.920]
people uh... i'm were desperate to get out i guess is the way to put it let me ask you are you

[00:41:25.130 --> 00:41:30.130]
of course redberry jackson's column who evidently had some loose-lipped source over there at some

[00:41:30.130 --> 00:41:35.130]
place to tell him that there would be no changes at w-i-o-d programming and that everybody's

[00:42:56.470 --> 00:43:01.810]
every day on fm and now yeah and now it looks like the opposite the only thing i know about buddy but

[00:43:01.810 --> 00:43:08.650]
paxon is what you is that memo you once read us over the air oh yeah and uh the the station uh

[00:43:08.650 --> 00:43:13.090]
reflects he did mention that they were going to be getting that guidebook the uh paxon guidebook

[00:43:13.090 --> 00:43:19.170]
right off the bat this is going to become a Christian value radio station no no it's just that i

[00:43:19.170 --> 00:43:22.910]
have to put a fish on each side of the car but other than that it'll be okay but anyway you know

[00:43:22.910 --> 00:43:27.690]
i know you know in fact dean goodman is the uh general manager so you got to have a few token

[00:43:27.690 --> 00:43:31.130]
Jews in there so he winked you know dean winked at me in the meeting said hey welcome aboard

[00:43:31.690 --> 00:43:36.270]
well that's a good thing yeah but i'll tell you what i said hot dog hopper board i hope that they don't

[00:43:36.270 --> 00:43:42.790]
try to muscle muscle any of uh the people that i love on uh w i don't think so because not only did he

[00:43:42.790 --> 00:43:47.910]
buy a station but he bought the audience well they know that okay i mean he went on he made a uh

[00:43:48.390 --> 00:43:54.210]
lengthy i mean a long ponderous i mean a drawn out thing about uh how they love the station

[00:43:54.210 --> 00:43:58.390]
and the station is the people on it and the programming they've done all this research and uh

[00:43:58.390 --> 00:44:01.950]
they don't plan of course of course they're always going to say they don't plan any major changes that

[00:44:01.950 --> 00:44:05.870]
doesn't hold any water with anybody i mean that's not a knock at him but it's just uh everybody always

[00:44:05.870 --> 00:44:10.910]
says that but uh well you know what would be the purpose of buying this station if you didn't want

[00:44:10.910 --> 00:44:14.210]
to keep the people who have the numbers on the station you follow what i'm saying what would be the point

[00:44:14.770 --> 00:44:19.910]
uh i hope that that's logical yeah i mean there wouldn't be a point unless you were trying to

[00:44:19.910 --> 00:44:25.250]
unless you had an agenda you were trying to buy a big station to to pursue that agenda no no i don't

[00:44:25.250 --> 00:44:30.730]
hear too much religious programming on a like ball or an i and z okay no the the agenda is the

[00:44:30.730 --> 00:44:34.750]
dollar bill that's all these people in broadcasting today that's their agenda regardless of any

[00:44:34.750 --> 00:44:39.790]
personal stuff trust me when i tell you it's a business well no i don't want a t-shirt or

[00:44:39.790 --> 00:44:44.850]
anything i just want me fifty dollars yeah okay thanks a lot thank you have a great day so

[00:44:44.850 --> 00:44:49.450]
everybody can take a big deep sigh a big breath of relief except my friends at the herald over there

[00:44:49.450 --> 00:44:54.570]
except for Barry Jackson who happens to be okay for a fat little puss yeah he actually sniffed

[00:44:54.570 --> 00:44:57.910]
this all out he's the only guy in town you got to give him a little bit of credit not too much but

[00:44:57.910 --> 00:45:02.790]
he actually went and doubt he sniffed it out so when's bow camper going to q a m we have an open

[00:45:02.790 --> 00:45:06.830]
line on a green line now was he wasn't at the meeting was he and man which wasn't there of course

[00:45:06.930 --> 00:45:13.190]
not full-time employees but they were conspicuous by the rapsons defo was there he had a beer in one

[00:45:13.190 --> 00:45:16.610]
hand in a golf club in the other hand kept winking at Steve nickel i don't know what that was all about

[00:45:17.730 --> 00:45:23.750]
oh boy talk about an incestuous relationship god almighty uh did i just say that i don't think so

[00:45:23.750 --> 00:45:28.150]

JC and here i'll show them what super services it's eleven after eleven at w i o d get also anyway

[00:45:33.910 --> 00:45:37.490]
you know the thing that really gave me the most confidence in the meeting this morning first we

[00:45:37.490 --> 00:45:41.650]
had bob niel and bob green from cox broadcasting breaking us the news and bob niel reading his prepared

[00:45:41.650 --> 00:45:46.710]
statement which i thought was a little kind of a stiff reading their bob and then but paxon and his

[00:45:46.710 --> 00:45:51.330]
people came in iridana clock and the thing that really gave me the utmost confidence when all the

[00:45:51.330 --> 00:45:55.730]
fm people left it was just as a m people sitting in the room and but paxon is kind of a big guy in it

[00:45:55.730 --> 00:45:59.530]
and imposing presence stood up there in front of the room and said the worst talk radio i've ever heard

[00:45:59.530 --> 00:46:05.570]
my livers on w out the worst talk radio i've ever heard my livers on w out yeah and we all say

[00:46:05.570 --> 00:46:12.430]
he loves us he loves us he lads you we have an open line on the green line one eight hundred nine

[00:46:12.430 --> 00:46:17.190]
four four nine four six three one eight hundred nine four four w i o d here's north mimey b

[00:46:17.190 --> 00:46:21.250]
chill out good morning yes sir i'm going to ask you a question here like a really wise person

[00:46:21.250 --> 00:46:25.170]
i'm going to ask you this why is that the state continuously attacks the pyramurial industry

[00:46:25.730 --> 00:46:29.470]
i don't understand that you know what do you mean by that well they're always giving them a hard time

[00:46:29.470 --> 00:46:33.690]
i don't understand because the state of a bunch of bozos don't you understand if if the state

[00:46:33.690 --> 00:46:37.550]
weren't a bunch of bozos we'd have had full card simul casting in card rooms and all this other stuff

[00:46:37.550 --> 00:46:41.510]
five years ago when everybody else was starting to put it in i don't know we're always the last and

[00:46:41.510 --> 00:46:44.990]
the worst i don't know if they realize every time you make a bet you're helping to stay out i don't

[00:46:44.990 --> 00:46:55.150]
know they don't realize that but you're asking me like it like i'm supposed to make sense out of

[00:46:55.150 --> 00:47:00.090]
finally they got it through the legislature and they also the same debra miller who was holding

[00:47:00.090 --> 00:47:04.470]
it up for months and months and months and while as long as the legislature passed it let's expedite

[00:47:04.470 --> 00:47:08.370]
it and allow it right away now instead of waiting till the first of july so we can take advantage of

[00:47:08.370 --> 00:47:12.190]
all the extra revenue that's coming in yeah i was that is that brilliant or what how about the extra

[00:47:12.190 --> 00:47:15.430]
revenue that could have been coming in for those months while they were holding it up well you know

[00:47:15.430 --> 00:47:19.390]
i don't get it i'm going to ruin the call by asking this what do you think about carry mills as pd

[00:47:20.830 --> 00:47:26.470]
like i said we have an open line and date seven five one nine four was that gary mills boyfriend or

[00:47:26.470 --> 00:47:31.930]
what jesus sounded just like him seven five one nine four six three and date we got an open line

[00:47:31.930 --> 00:47:35.190]
on a green line you better call on those green lines because now that we got a new outfit coming in

[00:47:35.190 --> 00:47:38.430]
here they're going to want to know okay which lines work which ones get the calls they're not

[00:47:38.430 --> 00:47:41.730]
going to be spending a hell of a lot of extra money wasting money down a drain they're going to

[00:47:41.730 --> 00:47:45.670]
make money with this turkey okay they're going to show the cocks people how it's done trust me when

[00:47:45.670 --> 00:47:52.150]
i tell you they're going to show these folks how to turn a damn big profit are they okay so

[00:47:52.150 --> 00:47:56.870]
anyway it's eleven seventeen it's just an amazing thing boy and if you've never been in no matter

[00:47:56.870 --> 00:48:00.730]
what kind of business although i guess in radio it happens more frequently than any other business

[00:48:00.730 --> 00:48:06.350]
you know what the entire staff is called in and they sit you down and they say well uh guess what

[00:48:06.350 --> 00:48:10.570]

cox broadcasting on this radio station one of the things that i'll never ever forgive i mean

[00:52:20.510 --> 00:52:26.230]
forget is and that was a Freudian slip was the great opportunity we had to be on ws u and had the

[00:52:26.230 --> 00:52:31.670]
great association with toddler eastern tom valvita for those two years whatever was of agony and hell

they all like uh... she or zeta there's no possibility of that

[00:56:49.390 --> 00:56:53.730]

[00:59:25.330 --> 00:59:29.430]
alan something or other alan something or other and then there's dean goodman which i know him

[00:59:29.430 --> 00:59:34.530]
because he actually would be right yeah al niri yeah he's bringing the chocolates to the

[00:59:34.530 --> 00:59:41.050]
pope yeah but anyway um i did know dean goodman because he used to be general manager of love 94

[00:59:41.050 --> 00:59:45.410]
back in those days when it was like everybody had one station or maybe two stations and then all

[00:59:45.410 --> 00:59:50.470]
of a sudden he got involved they passed and bought up love 94 and he was like the general manager

[00:59:50.470 --> 00:59:56.190]
of 175 radio stations so now i guess it's 176 he can't be all bad he's Jewish how do you like that

[00:59:56.190 --> 01:00:02.930]
oi here's plantation hello hello nil yes sir good morning wait as deas listen i wanted to ask you the

[01:00:03.810 --> 01:00:09.150]
the avalanche what was our record against indoor in the season not good not good at all huh i remember the

[01:00:09.150 --> 01:00:13.670]
last game we played out there we blew the lead and we wound up with a tie the game here that we had

[01:00:13.670 --> 01:00:17.670]
a four to one lead after one period we wound up blowing a game and losing it over time so i don't

[01:00:17.670 --> 01:00:21.430]
remember the whole i don't know what the overall record was although maybe that's all we played

[01:00:21.430 --> 01:00:25.450]
him because there are any other conference we may have only played him twice yeah which would be

[01:00:25.450 --> 01:00:30.250]
o one and one and what's with the red wings they seem like they're in a coma they are in a coma

[01:00:30.250 --> 01:00:35.690]
and steve iserman is all spent all this time in a hyperbaric chamber holding on to his groin and

[01:00:35.690 --> 01:00:40.390]
paul coffee left after the second period last night did not come back and then bob eerie got nailed

[01:00:40.390 --> 01:00:45.510]
and he didn't come back there they're done they are done better off he seems like he's not into it

[01:00:45.510 --> 01:00:50.570]
at all do you know he scored one goal in the whole playoffs i know i mean for a guy with his talent i

[01:00:50.570 --> 01:00:55.510]
mean it's like he's but i don't like he's in the fog or something yeah and see like there are real

[01:00:55.510 --> 01:01:00.450]
choke team they are i didn't i am i not the one that told you this many months ago even while

[01:01:00.450 --> 01:01:04.330]
they were winning every day in game and i said you just wait everybody laughed at me they said

[01:01:04.330 --> 01:01:09.090]
they're a force they're like a dynasty i said you wait till the playoffs somewhere along the line

[01:01:09.090 --> 01:01:13.270]
and probably before the finals they will choke the big one and they're they're gagging on it

[01:01:13.270 --> 01:01:17.690]
yeah no one's gonna have to tell you mentioned the she isn't there station in davi

[01:01:20.150 --> 01:01:20.610]
and

[01:01:20.610 --> 01:01:26.310]
kind of yeah at least it was now what it's in davi i thought that was a q a m q a m in kiss

[01:01:26.310 --> 01:01:32.050]
well that's miramar the reason i asked that was because i was out that way about a week ago

[01:01:32.050 --> 01:01:37.530]
and it's riding through a trot trailer park there where it is and at the back of the trailer

[01:01:37.530 --> 01:01:42.470]
for it isn't a trailer park right there radio station right you know that's exactly correct

[01:01:42.470 --> 01:01:47.170]
seems kind of a nod spot that the radio in the center of a trailer park unless you're going to go

[01:01:47.170 --> 01:01:55.170]
country i don't know maybe any chance again a t-shirt oh my god are you kidding me no problem okay

[01:03:47.150 --> 01:03:50.830]
does an Amsterdam he's missing out on all of this good news. yeah well he'd probably be too

[01:03:50.830 --> 01:03:54.470]
incoherent to understand it right now anyway. that's probably true. uh huh? probably true.

[01:03:54.470 --> 01:03:57.990]
but i think we're going to have like the coolest Christmas party we'll have Rick and

[01:03:57.990 --> 01:04:02.530]
suds we'll have you we'll have uh Steve Kane and we'll have Paul Castron over we're going to have

[01:04:02.530 --> 01:04:07.870]
like the cool you know i forgot about castron obelivert that about him oh my god. number one in the

[01:04:07.870 --> 01:04:12.250]
market now he'll probably number one in what? well right behind Howard's turn by a point or

[01:04:12.250 --> 01:04:16.970]
something. no actually he beat him out. did he beat him out? yes he did pretty badly two as a matter of

[01:04:16.970 --> 01:04:21.970]
fact. i never thought i'd be there. we got number one in midday by heads and shoulders which you're

[01:04:21.970 --> 01:04:27.510]
talking to right now and uh we'll see. and i'm number one overnight. well that doesn't matter but

[01:04:28.070 --> 01:04:35.630]
you know what do you got a point one? no. number one. i had a four five. a four point five share

[01:04:35.630 --> 01:04:40.150]
overnight. at ftl. oh my god and if only some of them were under the age of a hundred you'd be

[01:04:40.150 --> 01:04:43.310]
right in the ballpark. that's true. well you're no john levert just keep saying that to yourself.

[01:04:43.310 --> 01:04:48.650]
i don't know what it is. nick warrens is dragging all of these talk show hosts from the 1970s and

[01:04:48.650 --> 01:04:52.590]
having them fill in for the norm can't while he's on vacation. yeah that's it's sabotage is what

[01:04:52.590 --> 01:04:56.090]
it's called Steve probably put him up to it. well i want to see your next time next time you see john

[01:04:56.090 --> 01:05:00.530]
levert just steer him in the face and go uh-huh and see what he does. i think he's still wearing the same

[01:05:00.530 --> 01:05:05.390]
clothes he was wearing when he worked at w n w s. he used to sleeping him. i never thought that we

[01:05:05.390 --> 01:05:08.850]
would be working at the same company but you're not going to be in the same building as us though.

[01:05:08.970 --> 01:05:14.050]
yes we will. aren't you going to be up there on four forty one? yeah. yes we will. oh how do you

[01:05:14.050 --> 01:05:18.410]
like that? that is just very bizarre. so you better get your knee pads ready Brian. oh yeah that's

[01:05:18.410 --> 01:05:24.110]
right. okay. all right but we'll be looking for you. okay believe me. we have an open line. yeah

[01:05:24.110 --> 01:05:27.570]
that's Brian. he's a good guy. he's okay. he looks pretty good. yeah that's right. we'll have

[01:05:27.570 --> 01:05:31.830]
JC in there. he'll be like hanging around just being there from around. that's it's going to be a

[01:05:31.830 --> 01:05:35.450]
great thing. you know what? just keep saying that to yourself. no i started to say this before.

[01:05:36.370 --> 01:05:40.130]
and then i kind of interrupted myself which i've never done before. and that is when something like

[01:05:40.130 --> 01:05:45.570]
this happens and of course you have these preconceived notions about everybody. although i'm

[01:05:45.570 --> 01:05:50.170]
the last many years of my life i've been much less in other words i don't care about jay core about

[01:05:50.170 --> 01:05:56.570]
this company about new city. i don't care about any of that. it doesn't affect my life. in other

[01:05:56.570 --> 01:06:00.290]
words if ever they should buy the station one of those companies then at that point i start figuring

[01:06:00.290 --> 01:06:04.230]
out are they good? are they bad? are they assholes? what are they? but all these people that spend their

[01:06:04.230 --> 01:06:07.430]
whole lives worrying about what? and of course most of the people that spend a lot of time worrying

[01:06:07.430 --> 01:06:12.750]
about stuff like that are people who are always looking for a job like pd's. oh yeah well clear

[01:06:12.750 --> 01:06:17.450]
channels doing this and jay core is doing that and my ads on pades 28 and r and r. oh sorry

[01:06:18.510 --> 01:06:25.190]
stuff like that. but uh you know you can't in other words you can't tell what the water is going to

[01:06:25.190 --> 01:06:29.710]
taste like until you drink from the well right? isn't that the way it works? something like that is

[01:06:29.710 --> 01:06:33.550]
it. yeah i just made that up. it was kind of like a half a line from the godfather.

[01:06:35.030 --> 01:06:40.170]
he must let us draw the water from the well. is that what he said? if he's our pizon, if he's our

[01:06:40.170 --> 01:06:45.930]
friend. must let us wet our beak. exactly that's what i just said. he must let us wet our beak.

[01:06:46.950 --> 01:06:52.590]
what a chicken shots comment that was. so anyway buddy bud said you can have all the water you want

[01:06:52.590 --> 01:06:55.730]
as long as it's so late and they keep bringing it to you for free and i said thanks a lot pal.

[01:06:56.970 --> 01:07:01.330]
hey listen the man is from Rochester, New York okay right off the bat. he's mentioning

[01:07:01.330 --> 01:07:08.070]
w-h-a-m-w-h-a-e-c. w-s-a-y. right off the bat we got this great relationship okay. he's a big sports

[01:07:08.070 --> 01:07:14.870]
fan. he loves the panthers. okay so we can't all be a goyem. i mean what's you know some of us are

[01:07:14.870 --> 01:07:21.390]
gotta be Jews just to keep the word going. i don't know but like i said it starts sinking and you really

[01:07:21.390 --> 01:07:24.730]
don't know you get to that point where you're kind of like in that and i'm sure by later on like

[01:07:24.730 --> 01:07:29.690]
it detracted him i'd be really confused. here's pember and of course talk about yenthas. oh won't

[01:07:29.690 --> 01:07:35.590]

[01:07:59.930 --> 01:08:04.670]
well i know Laurie Shepherd's a lady. yeah and then she wouldn't want to say that how you had worked

[01:08:04.670 --> 01:08:09.070]
for two other stations and she wouldn't also want to say that how many stations that just

[01:08:09.070 --> 01:08:13.830]
packed them home. right. how did i be that going you know and how do you like that? yeah so then

[01:08:14.330 --> 01:08:19.470]
but i i never heard it on on your station you know until until you came on. well that's because

[01:12:09.490 --> 01:12:14.910]
going to redo your contract with uh paxon or are you just going here they're they're they're

[01:12:14.910 --> 01:12:20.450]
assuming it they're assuming so George's not going to get any more either oh i don't know that's

[01:12:20.450 --> 01:12:24.950]
between him and him no i heard doubt it you don't you don't put your fingers in that they said

[01:12:24.950 --> 01:12:33.770]
they they pay by a height so and he's in big trouble oh and my last question being um actually not

[01:12:33.770 --> 01:12:40.010]
my last but uh what about the i got you down lady is she uh are they going to blow her off

[01:12:40.410 --> 01:12:44.490]
i i don't think so they said they were buying out all these contracts and she was the one of

[01:12:44.490 --> 01:12:49.050]
them so i assume she's going to be here yeah but with the right wing mentality i mean with

[01:12:49.050 --> 01:12:52.730]
the sex and all well if they had a right wing mentality that they wanted to put over

[01:12:52.730 --> 01:12:58.830]
on a year why would they keep me here in other words if they want to draw numbers she doesn't well

[01:12:59.290 --> 01:13:02.870]
so i rest my case i don't know i really can't tell you i know she was in the meeting i saw her for

[01:13:02.870 --> 01:13:09.530]
about a half a second and uh nobody said goodbye but i i to be honest with you i think her deal is um

[01:13:10.210 --> 01:13:13.810]
i don't know whether it's expired already or if it's up in september somebody said yesterday her

[01:13:13.810 --> 01:13:18.490]
contract is up in september and that's about the time when the uh the uh fcc would approve the

[01:13:18.490 --> 01:13:24.490]
so i don't know well we're asking for something so i do know i do know this and i'm not letting

[01:13:24.490 --> 01:13:29.510]
any cats out of the bag because paxson said this in public many times they're very sports oriented

[01:13:29.510 --> 01:13:35.270]
they've already got the heat they've already got um you know their sites they would like to keep

[01:13:35.270 --> 01:13:39.270]
the dolphins on a station which they'll have this dog the dolphins for this next season and i

[01:13:39.270 --> 01:13:43.590]
think they would like to get the panthers in the marlins and the whole ball of wax so maybe we can

[01:13:43.590 --> 01:13:51.630]
have you from uh ten to two and then from say six to ten with uh panther talk yeah there you go

[01:13:51.630 --> 01:13:57.070]
hey that's it and last but least uh could i get that t-shirt oh my god do we have any left by the way

[01:13:57.070 --> 01:14:01.990]
George oh we have three left okay no problem hey i appreciate it hang on have a great one he's on my

[01:14:01.990 --> 01:14:09.270]
three we got we got what one left now or two left one like i said we have three left because

[01:14:09.270 --> 01:14:13.550]
i sent six and you said five earlier no i said they sent six you just weren't paying any attention

[01:14:13.550 --> 01:14:17.550]
you were busy doing your yenta routine and there were all these other underlings i'm sure you said five

[01:14:17.550 --> 01:14:22.150]
i said six mister okay five i said tinkway what does that mean

[01:14:24.610 --> 01:14:27.230]
mexican nickname i said we give things away the tinkway

[01:14:28.650 --> 01:14:32.450]
so anyway like that so when you receive them in a male the envelope will be on a slant i don't

[01:14:32.450 --> 01:14:36.310]
know what the hell that's all about just cut their crabs quick quick try to be cute okay we're trying

[01:14:45.850 --> 01:14:49.690]
maybe he can get some more of those goddamn male models off soft beach like he did the last day

[01:14:49.690 --> 01:14:54.610]
he worked over here that was a show Nick that was something okay that was really a great job i'll

[01:14:54.610 --> 01:14:58.590]
tell you one thing about Georgie porgy over here he don't get no guests like that of course we

[01:14:58.590 --> 01:15:04.070]
don't do any guest but here's Miami hello how are you doing oh we get his that ugly rumor yes sir

[01:15:04.070 --> 01:15:06.350]
nil i got a question right uh

[01:15:07.330 --> 01:15:13.570]
he put her off right do you think that's Russian mafia has had to think going on because i remember

[01:15:13.570 --> 01:15:17.910]
they had a story about that so you think there's something going on with that oh well i don't

[01:15:18.450 --> 01:15:24.270]
no no okay i think i think it's the big choke i think Don Sherry's right about these Russians i

[01:15:24.270 --> 01:15:29.470]
think when the pressure when the go and get stuff the Russians take off right and um all the

[01:15:29.470 --> 01:15:36.250]
Haitian say go Pate's okay i'll read the urge say one we have an open line and did he say all the

[01:15:36.250 --> 01:15:42.750]
Haitians say go Pate's right all right uh the bandwagon's big enough for them to hang on to the

[01:15:42.750 --> 01:15:48.770]
edge they're probably used to that you know there's little rafts we have an open line in date 7519463 751

[01:15:48.770 --> 01:15:53.110]
wiod one on a green line one 800 in case you missed the big news this morning i don't know where

[01:15:53.110 --> 01:15:58.650]
the hell you've been this is a very momentous day Cox enterprise this as sold wiod radio to

[01:15:58.650 --> 01:16:03.270]
packs and communications ink and the sale will take effect in about three months or so probably

[01:16:03.270 --> 01:16:08.850]
about early september when the FCC approves same and in the meantime Cox enterprises retains the rights

[01:16:08.850 --> 01:16:12.590]
and we still got the same sad looking people wondering around a building because guess what were

[01:16:12.590 --> 01:16:19.710]
the stepchildren now see that that's the interesting part to us on the a m we'll look at some of

[01:16:19.710 --> 01:16:24.510]
those people and say well you know they're ancient history but in the meantime we're in their building

[01:16:26.790 --> 01:16:30.450]
we're in their building do you understand what i'm saying isn't that a very uncomfortable feeling

[01:16:31.530 --> 01:16:35.870]
like even though Cox still owns it we're like a stepchildren and it's any day that we're going to

[01:16:35.870 --> 01:16:39.770]
be belonging to somebody else but even after we belong to Paxible still be in his building for

[01:16:39.770 --> 01:16:43.070]
some months because it's eight or nine or ten months before they get their new building finished

[01:24:13.750 --> 01:24:17.550]
everybody knows that if i go somewhere they might as well take this thing and just shove it out into

[01:30:33.170 --> 01:30:36.750]
credit he said finally said yeah you got to admit we were lucky to get out of that first period

[01:30:36.750 --> 01:30:41.070]
alive they were all over us after the first two minutes they created all the good scoring chances

[01:30:41.070 --> 01:30:45.590]
and they outplayed us badly in the first period so even that boy up there in Pittsburgh is finally

[01:30:45.590 --> 01:30:49.510]
staring to admit we got a real team down here damn straight and it's about time I was

[01:30:49.510 --> 01:30:54.690]
set up all of this bull crap I had a sore throat the last time I screamed like that was when the

[01:30:55.250 --> 01:31:02.170]
giants won the Super Bowl yeah and um hey did you hear of Phil yesterday that was the the

[01:31:02.170 --> 01:31:07.730]

[01:31:40.030 --> 01:31:46.030]
kept putting on then I'd go back to him and he he kept the heartbeat and he was totally out of

[01:31:46.030 --> 01:31:51.210]

[01:32:03.290 --> 01:32:08.570]
with bull crap something I'm used to doing every day it was reminiscent of that classical four-hour

[01:32:09.270 --> 01:32:13.590]
exactly that's what I was thinking every time I got in the car and I tune it back in and he was

[01:32:13.590 --> 01:32:17.030]
still doing the same thing but you got to admit there was some good voicemail stuff in the background

breakthrough yes sir I went out and bought me a nice jersey expensive one for that man uh huh

[01:36:06.630 --> 01:36:11.810]
and didn't have like no numbers on it and I seen all the people that have it the same jersey with

[01:36:11.810 --> 01:36:17.450]
the with some numbers on it and I was wondering if there's a place that you could go to that puts

[01:36:17.450 --> 01:36:21.570]
letters and numbers on it yeah I would think that any sports shop if they got you know if they're

[01:36:21.750 --> 01:36:26.090]
through salt at the uh they do that stuff that would go with the uh territory wouldn't you think

[01:36:26.090 --> 01:36:29.890]
with the appropriate colors though not just like black letters or something you know like

[01:36:30.510 --> 01:36:34.770]
whatever colors it may be right that's what I'm saying to you yeah like Denise Pott fans sports

[01:36:34.770 --> 01:36:40.010]
place or the sports deep o or any of those uh goyem something like that right and that would be cool

[01:36:40.010 --> 01:36:45.510]
yeah and then that's why I called it just to find out and uh okay you got it I have a good day

[01:36:45.510 --> 01:36:50.910]

[01:48:37.830 --> 01:48:43.030]

[01:48:43.030 --> 01:48:47.450]
save and making it look great in other words he has a showboat he's a hot dog and he'll take an

[01:48:47.450 --> 01:48:51.190]
ordinary glove save and all of a sudden he'll throw that glove up in the air and he'll juggle it and

[01:48:51.190 --> 01:48:55.810]
grab it again and take just the most routine save and make himself look good i will grant

[01:48:55.810 --> 01:49:01.550]

[01:49:42.630 --> 01:49:46.890]
called to the range that why i see it is actually in uh... what's going to happen is they're going

[01:49:46.890 --> 01:49:51.390]
to have full call call that whatever called the takes highly is going to have it's going to be like a

[01:49:51.390 --> 01:49:55.370]
big off track uh... betting facility but why would anybody go to higher lea

[01:49:55.370 --> 01:49:59.650]
uh... because it's close in proximity to where they live and they feel like some of the lost people

[01:49:59.650 --> 01:50:04.750]
from the uh... you know i noticed that highly a randy daily attendance out about twenty five hundred

stand the cup playoffs that's the only time they make any money on sports right listen i got

[01:58:29.970 --> 01:58:33.650]
thing since it's not probably think it's not a good idea to play that great song there before the

[01:58:33.650 --> 01:58:38.070]
game because the penguins might be upset too bad is what i say exactly well my name is bobbo and maybe

[02:00:45.370 --> 02:00:48.970]

[02:00:48.970 --> 02:00:53.450]
let us down with mike laying this time but he did and it's one of those things you know you go to

[02:00:53.450 --> 02:00:56.750]
the well too often and guys who come through in the past they just uh you know fall a little bit

[02:00:56.750 --> 02:01:00.350]
short of the mark and uh you know we're gonna have to start arranging our own guests you know

[02:01:00.350 --> 02:01:04.470]
or else uh do better lunches thanks guys good guys in air from channel four uh coming in here

[02:01:04.470 --> 02:01:08.470]
asking me questions about things that i thought were supposed to be top secret see that puts me

[02:01:08.470 --> 02:01:12.710]
in a very precarious position because we have a meeting this morning and everybody saying oh this

[02:01:12.710 --> 02:01:16.450]
is top secret and don't let the cat out of the bag and the meantime these guys uh walk in here

[02:01:16.450 --> 02:01:21.310]
and each one of them is holding a cat the radio station where gibberish is the official language

[02:01:21.310 --> 02:01:27.990]
w-i-o-d my army fort-lawter day views talking entertainment radio six ten w-i-o-d

[02:01:27.990 --> 02:01:31.790]
so now depending on which uh station you're listening to do you know what what do you mean

[02:01:32.350 --> 02:01:37.770]
well evidently w-i-n-z a paxon station is going on here and broadcasting all sorts of things about

[02:01:37.770 --> 02:01:41.670]
this transaction today that we were sworn to secrecy about that are not supposed to be common

[02:01:41.670 --> 02:01:45.730]
knowledge and also buddy but says he's offended by some of the language he hears on w-i-o-d

[02:01:45.730 --> 02:01:49.630]
what language exactly it's the one to do

[02:03:01.790 --> 02:03:09.810]
and the way to the song and all but the chance play and come again

[02:03:10.750 --> 02:03:17.110]
oh no the chance play and come

[02:03:20.430 --> 02:03:20.990]
okay

[02:03:30.410 --> 02:03:35.150]
so anyway it's 107 and w-i-d hope the guy got that on tape I hope he has a good time with it I hope

[02:03:35.150 --> 02:03:41.530]
uh I go home and blow my brains out is what I hope two open lines in day seven five one nine four six

[02:03:41.530 --> 02:03:46.630]
three see you know it's very interesting as usual a talent were the ones that are put on a hot spot

[02:03:46.630 --> 02:03:51.330]
the audience out there they don't hear the uh the meetings unfortunately I wish you could

[02:03:51.330 --> 02:03:56.310]
but they don't hear the management people the hot shots and the suits the owners the big

[02:03:56.310 --> 02:04:01.170]
of billionaires they don't hear any of that stuff so were the ones who are really we got our

[02:04:01.170 --> 02:04:06.890]
feet to the fire and you sit down with people and you say okay give me an idea before I go in

[02:04:06.890 --> 02:04:11.390]
here at 10 o'clock how you want to present this what do you want to say et cetera and so on

[02:04:11.390 --> 02:04:15.470]
and then you come to find out all the things that are not supposed to be common knowledge that are

[02:04:15.470 --> 02:04:19.510]
supposed to be kept under the uh table now all of a sudden they're like on the year with other

[02:04:19.510 --> 02:04:25.850]
stations in the market wouldn't you think that when two companies of this magnitude make a transaction

[02:04:25.850 --> 02:04:30.730]
there'd be some kind of an understanding either implicit or in writing that uh some of these uh

[02:04:30.730 --> 02:04:36.550]
said same things would be like uh unsaid you would think so but hey I'm just here man I'm just

[02:04:36.550 --> 02:04:40.810]
doing my thing a rolling along singing a song we'll have those rats to give away from our friends

[02:04:40.810 --> 02:04:47.710]
tomorrow have a dozen of those and we'll just do the best we can here's a mobile implantation hello

[02:04:47.710 --> 02:04:55.590]
oh good meal yes sir god I just kissed the cup you just kissed it huh they have the uh Stanley

[02:04:55.590 --> 02:05:00.270]
cup of JC penny and a briar ball I thought it was going to be two to seven well well it was

[02:05:00.270 --> 02:05:05.450]
actually supposed to be twelve to five yeah and a cup got there at about twelve forty five they were

[02:05:05.450 --> 02:05:09.790]
waiting there they're gonna be there until five o'clock okay but it's pretty cool maybe tomorrow

[02:05:09.790 --> 02:05:14.230]
it's two to seven and having sure of the JC penny it could be yeah but uh there's most

[02:05:14.230 --> 02:05:18.850]
security around that cup then uh they're present in Clinton they're better be especially in this town

[02:05:19.470 --> 02:05:24.610]
but uh it was funny to see the crowd because you have these old ladies with their pant their

[02:05:24.610 --> 02:05:30.710]
shirts and jackets and hats right unbelievable yeah we're all on the bad wagon now man oh real fan

[02:05:30.710 --> 02:05:35.770]
they're all kissing it and and and then not to be discriminatory but you get too black guys to come

[02:05:35.770 --> 02:05:43.110]
walking through the mall hey man anybody got tickets there you go swing by and away home it's

[02:05:43.110 --> 02:05:48.910]
pretty cool okay see ya we have an open line and Broward five two four nine four six three five

[02:05:48.910 --> 02:05:53.590]

still alive over there boy there's a lot of dead people from that building man just Jennifer and I

[02:06:04.210 --> 02:06:08.530]
uh we just we come what do we count up to about 172 dead people just in about five seconds there

[02:06:08.530 --> 02:06:14.470]
in that last hour man a lot of people didn't make it through that place so evidently those people

[02:06:14.470 --> 02:06:17.630]
over there on the other side of this deal they're getting a lot more straight information

[02:06:17.630 --> 02:06:21.630]
to know what's going on and we're over here like uh well what uh what do we do what do we what do

[02:06:21.630 --> 02:06:26.110]
we say what do we you know you know you're all talking about yeah that's what we're getting

[02:06:27.310 --> 02:06:31.510]
here's west Palm Beach hello okay i can't believe it's caught you off guard

[02:06:31.970 --> 02:06:36.010]
what what is that you didn't have it inkly what was your happen when you walked in there no

[02:06:36.010 --> 02:06:40.110]
i think that's the main well i mean there are so many rumors going around it's like column eight

[02:06:40.110 --> 02:06:44.370]
through c or d you knew it was one of several different options but uh who's your gym

[02:06:44.870 --> 02:06:50.470]

[02:06:50.470 --> 02:06:56.010]
not gonna be involved with this station right so maybe ready to come back i doubt that i thought

[02:06:56.010 --> 02:06:59.630]
that's the only thing hanging her up from coming back now that's what she's saying up here

[02:07:00.490 --> 02:07:05.610]
i wouldn't hold my breath okay uh hopefully go over if i'm a sound a lot better um i was down to

[02:07:10.890 --> 02:07:17.670]

[02:07:23.630 --> 02:07:27.210]

[02:07:45.390 --> 02:07:50.150]

that's a commentary about uh rena football anyway he does a good job but he just couldn't wait to

[02:07:55.410 --> 02:07:59.390]

we have an open line at day 7519 463751 wio d this is the home of the mimey dolphin

[02:10:01.650 --> 02:10:10.910]
oh okay let's go to a Cooper city hello nale yes sir uh when not if the panthers play the avalanche

[02:10:10.910 --> 02:10:16.090]
what determines who has a quiet it's not a question of if it's a question of when that's a very

[02:10:16.090 --> 02:10:20.970]
good point well said even bob green couldn't have done a better one who did or how is it determined

[02:10:20.970 --> 02:10:25.730]
who has first home ice advantage you know something that's a very interesting question and we

[02:10:25.730 --> 02:10:29.770]
were mulling that over at the arena the last uh Philadelphia game there were a bunch of us were

[02:10:29.770 --> 02:10:34.790]
having a discussion about that and i do believe that they alternate the years one year the eastern

[02:10:34.790 --> 02:10:39.430]
conference has the home uh you know advantage in the next year it's the west and i'm pretty damn sure

[02:10:39.430 --> 02:10:46.470]
that last year um detroit had home advantage against new jersey so the panthers would have it so i

[02:10:46.470 --> 02:10:49.850]
do believe the panthers would have home ice regardless of the record which needless to say

[02:10:49.850 --> 02:10:55.490]
Colorado's got a better one but i think they do it on an alternating basis i believe i could be

[02:10:55.490 --> 02:10:59.090]
wrong but i don't think so somebody will tell us somebody really knows for sure

[02:10:59.810 --> 02:11:04.790]
like defo okay thanks no panthers have a great day yes somebody who really knows about that but i just

[02:11:04.790 --> 02:11:11.870]
i i pretty it's kind of like the world serious you know we have an open line in date 7519463 we've got

[02:11:11.870 --> 02:11:16.790]
an open line in brown art 524 wild and you know evidently they're not an awful lot of people listening

[02:11:16.790 --> 02:11:22.610]
to i and z thank god oh thank god for that because i don't want to have to be the one who confronts

[02:11:22.610 --> 02:11:26.010]
this other stuff when it comes down which you think would be all that long you don't want to say

[02:11:26.050 --> 02:11:32.170]
and what do we do then what do we do then or did you uh huh i would really like to ask you that

[02:11:32.170 --> 02:11:36.870]
question what do we do then when we're confronted with all that stuff that's uh being blabbered around

[02:11:36.870 --> 02:11:45.730]
i don't know okay here's a lady in the gable cello hello the lady in the gables is gone

[02:11:47.530 --> 02:11:52.630]
how can the lady in the gables be gone okay see that disturbs me tremendously

[02:11:53.190 --> 02:12:00.470]
uh what oh we got the answer to the ticket thing online oh hello hello hello nil yes sir

[02:12:00.470 --> 02:12:04.910]

going to come in here and uh stick that cigar in your nose hello picking up its butt right nil

[02:12:09.850 --> 02:12:16.490]
john fiber here did you get your season oh don't tell me we just lost him too is he gone

[02:12:17.210 --> 02:12:20.950]

[02:12:20.950 --> 02:12:28.650]
give yourself a decent cell phone too did i get my season i got my hockey tickets if that's what

[02:12:28.650 --> 02:12:32.570]
you're asking what the other thing he's asking i have no idea oh and you know something else by

[02:12:32.570 --> 02:12:36.730]
the way that i'm just thinking about here as part of this deal what's going to happen with those

[02:12:36.730 --> 02:12:43.810]
hockey tickets yeah that's part of my deal with cox huh which will be a long gone they'll be out

[02:12:43.810 --> 02:12:48.030]
of the picture come October what's going to be happening with my season tickets for the panthers

[02:12:48.030 --> 02:12:52.130]
which if i have to pay for myself that's okay too because i bought an extra pair this year

[02:12:53.030 --> 02:12:59.470]
oh my god hello hello yes sir hey how you doing nil okay hey eastern conference on my

[02:12:59.470 --> 02:13:03.650]
this year that's what i said you're the man they alternate right you're the man yes sir last year

[02:13:03.650 --> 02:13:08.550]
devil's wanted at home game force swept the wings right and the wings can swept this year too

[02:13:08.550 --> 02:13:13.370]
up tight oh boy they're brutal okay thanks pal i pick up a go and see i was right for once in my

[02:13:13.370 --> 02:13:17.290]
life they alternate just like the world series one year it's in the nationally thing one year

[02:13:17.290 --> 02:13:20.950]
it's an american league one year they do the dh one year they don't et cetera and so on

[02:13:21.370 --> 02:13:25.070]
course one year they they do the dh in american league home games right isn't that the way they do it

[02:13:25.070 --> 02:13:29.730]
who cares about baseball give me a break even though the marlins win basically every day there's

[02:13:29.730 --> 02:13:36.650]
still ain't nobody that cares and uh so so the latest deal is buddy bud was referring to the

[02:13:36.650 --> 02:13:40.090]
sex show there every night which i think she's in a lot of trouble is what that's all about i think

[02:13:40.090 --> 02:13:44.170]
she's gonna be history which uh quite frankly i think she was gonna be history in it but i don't

[02:13:44.230 --> 02:13:48.250]
know i wish you're the best okay she's a nice person she's okay she never stole a freight train

[02:13:48.250 --> 02:13:54.570]
she came in she aworked her ass off so to speak and uh you know there can be no question there

[02:13:54.570 --> 02:13:58.230]
might be a few changes here and there as far as the other one that i was uh asked about before

[02:13:58.810 --> 02:14:02.810]
we're sex and children from predators and we're there to let you know

[02:14:02.810 --> 02:14:09.290]
the established sex offender registries of convicted silence sexual predators and that the parents

[02:14:09.290 --> 02:14:14.310]
in a community and law enforcement have the right to know that these individuals have moved into

[02:14:14.310 --> 02:14:23.030]
the community on bus news talking entertainment radio six ten w-i-o-d it's not just Hank Goldberg

[02:14:23.030 --> 02:14:24.710]
it's a hippopotamus

[02:15:09.290 --> 02:15:09.610]
uh

[02:15:27.810 --> 02:15:31.630]
so anyway it's a one twenty six at w-i-d so what about that guy that's uh

[02:15:31.630 --> 02:15:36.130]
casted over sidekick what the hell is his name omelet and what did he put on the ice

[02:15:36.130 --> 02:15:43.210]
at all oh okay we have two overlined but what but oh but oh he didn't put his ass on

[02:15:43.210 --> 02:15:48.430]
the ice he put his big fat here's the mobile in four-letter deal hello there was ever

[02:15:48.430 --> 02:15:54.570]
a match as a manager just played yeah was that them together uh-huh the panthers do not have

[02:15:54.570 --> 02:15:58.830]
home ice we got our season tickets they only give you three games if they make up of that means

[02:15:58.830 --> 02:16:04.370]
there's no fourth game here and i just called the panther how can that be well that's how it is

[02:16:04.370 --> 02:16:08.550]
i just called the panthers also and they said we do not have home ice the other the west conference

[02:16:09.270 --> 02:16:13.630]
does well maybe they do go by points then because caloretto had a hell of a lot more points than we

[02:16:13.630 --> 02:16:17.750]
did yeah well i'm not sure how they do it in hockey but there's no doubt that the west has home ice

[02:16:17.750 --> 02:16:21.830]
damn it see i never even looked at that because i'm busy looking at my uh you know jk and whatever

[02:16:21.830 --> 02:16:25.210]
these other ones are for this round but after we sweep through the pissberg and we went to

[02:16:25.210 --> 02:16:29.490]
in uh-caloretta we come back here and sweep them and it's over sounds good to me it's it's the plan

[02:16:29.490 --> 02:16:34.230]
sounds acceptable okay okay thanks for the bad news see ya we have an open line in day seven

[02:16:34.230 --> 02:16:38.110]
five one well how come the guy that called before him was like so absolutely positive i mean he

[02:16:38.110 --> 02:16:41.650]
could have been full of crap because people who are full of crap always calling our very positive

[02:21:01.990 --> 02:21:06.230]
major serious problems which only at this moment are starting to rear their ugly head and thank

[02:21:06.790 --> 02:21:11.090]
it's already one thirty one plus forty seconds in the afternoon and i'm going to be getting my

[02:21:11.090 --> 02:21:15.510]
ass out of here very quickly today and all of a sudden i'm developing a severe migraine all of

[02:21:15.510 --> 02:21:20.910]
them are as payday it's Thursday i'll be in at least briefly anyhow oh brother

[02:21:22.310 --> 02:21:27.670]

yes yes i'm you know no big deal but i i call it thank you for turning me on to two good things

[02:21:32.810 --> 02:21:37.770]
yeah first i was in vegas on uh... the the first time the pan to play out game

[02:21:37.770 --> 02:21:43.190]
at the luxor yeah there's three things are you know and everything i called you i thought it was

[02:21:43.190 --> 02:21:48.430]
funny the day by four i got there on the south end where you get off the taxi a guy climbed all

[02:21:48.430 --> 02:21:54.250]
the way from the bottom to the top of it from from the bottom of what from the bottom of the

[02:21:54.250 --> 02:22:00.010]
luxor oh the luxor to the top of it to the top of the pyramid all right they said there was

[02:22:00.010 --> 02:22:03.710]
guys hanging there and standing around betting whether you make or not i love it

[02:22:03.710 --> 02:22:07.230]
yeah but it's that luxor is beautiful and that's vegas way you get two guys falling from a building

[02:22:07.230 --> 02:22:11.110]
and i'll bet which one's going to hit the ground first you got it that would be hard to fall from the luxor

[02:22:11.110 --> 02:22:16.030]
you can probably get odds on that in every casino and town you'd have to tumble to fall from the luxor

[02:22:16.030 --> 02:22:19.530]
yeah but it was really neat i don't i just called it thank you for turning me on to it

[02:27:47.610 --> 02:27:53.390]
we're all done we managed to keep this thing afloat for nearly four hours today which if i do say

[02:27:53.390 --> 02:27:58.430]

[02:28:18.170 --> 02:28:22.230]
like this one i know you don't like it because he knows down a nap saw right because i talked to you

[02:28:22.230 --> 02:28:26.810]
a couple months ago you know that's all sucks okay they can take that saw and blow it off the face

[02:28:26.810 --> 02:28:31.370]
of the globe but i know you like this yeah i was down there at the beginning of the stand-up play

[02:28:31.370 --> 02:28:35.730]
off so into the sports book down there put a ten dollar bet on the panthers twenty five to one

[02:28:35.730 --> 02:28:41.450]
right so i'm waiting for them to just finish up now okay so that's not very good odd so

[02:28:41.450 --> 02:28:46.890]
huh what when was this this was at the beginning of the stand-up playoff i think they

[02:28:46.890 --> 02:28:50.550]
just started the first game because i think at the beginning of the year they were doing like

[02:28:50.550 --> 02:28:54.770]
five hundred to one somebody sent me a a photo copy of a thing he got in Vegas back in the

[02:28:54.770 --> 02:28:58.030]
beginning of the season and he made a ten or a twenty five dollar bet at five hundred to one

[02:28:58.570 --> 02:29:02.830]
that's unbelievable yeah i wish i was there this was just the beginning of the stand-up playoff so

[02:29:03.390 --> 02:29:08.150]
you know samler was like still two fifty to one i'm not so sure that they have it's kind of like

[02:29:08.150 --> 02:29:11.510]
uh some of the old racetracks they have windows where they sell the tickets but i'm not sure if they

[02:29:11.510 --> 02:29:16.750]
cash you know i'm going into bohamas you can cash them here for a lot of you you're sure of that huh

[02:29:16.750 --> 02:29:22.210]

time since we've seen a development like this seven five one nine four six three maybe they all

[02:29:33.650 --> 02:29:37.590]

[02:40:50.090 --> 02:40:54.570]
knows something about hockey you know yeah okay but who the hell can listen to that no you know

[02:40:54.570 --> 02:40:59.130]
because uh that feral on the radio nobody can listen to that that's the most obnoxious sound i've

[02:40:59.130 --> 02:41:03.770]
ever heard in my life it's like listening to somebody scrape their fingers on a on a blackboard

[02:41:03.770 --> 02:41:08.550]
for four hours but the thing is he knows more than than all those guys who work in the daytime or

[02:41:08.550 --> 02:41:11.890]
there but it's very sad because like you just got through saying who the hell can listen to it

[02:41:12.330 --> 02:41:15.570]
yes so why doesn't he ditch the act already and just do a damn sports show
