30 on it

[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.560]
Here's Miami on one hello, hello, Neil. Yes, sir

[00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:03.220]
He was talking about something you read in a paper and I'm surprised that you don't know about it's called the person partial worth abortion

[00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.760]
Bill, it's already I do know what do you mean you're surprised?

[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.580]
I don't know about it. Don't you think I read the paper and watch the news?

[00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.980]
I saw the big thing on I just mentioned the thing

[00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:16.180]
I said you never can't you believe what you're hearing all this stuff. I mean you'd I thought you would have said

[00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:24.200]
Yeah, sure I've heard about it. That's what it is. Yeah, so what about it is true. I just want to hear is I'm just telling it's part of the liberal agenda to keep it quiet

[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.300]
Part of the liberal agenda here. We go another rush limbaugh asked

[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.800]
What's the liberal what's the liberal agenda you want to tell me what that is?

[00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.140]
I'm just 50 50 and I'm just one down. What do you mean you're 50 50 half man and half woman?

[00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.660]
What are you? Her appetite? I take back well go after yourself. Okay?

[00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:48.780]
The ought to be able to do it. He's 50 50. He said he's got one of these and one of those and one of them and one of these is half and half

[00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.940]
Right another one of these right till I go save somebody that's out there getting murdered right now

[00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:59.500]
And stop with the fetus crap already will you my god these people that get all hung up because they get brainwashed and brainwashed

[00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.520]
Do you see how this works?

[00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.780]
Everybody who's for abortion was at one time themselves at PC

[00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:13.720]
Yeah, I rest my case and by the way all those guys in Arizona they arrested this morning all those people that were gonna blow up all those federal buildings

[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.540]
Seems to me that those were part of the liberal agenda where they there were a bunch of skinhead right wing lunatics

[00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.620]
Okay, those are the people that you got to look out for is those crazy right wingers the liberals

[00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:29.080]
They're basically impotent and having a good time. Here's the Hollywood. Hello. Yeah, sir. I doubt it

[00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.980]
But I'll give it a shot. I'll make it up and I

[00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.540]
Bore you just call themselves pro-life right now

[00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:40.100]
Those they both pro-life are typically anti gun control right now

[00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.960]
But you're missing you're missing the point they only care about

[00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:49.080]
Nebulous life that is doesn't exist yet. They only care about the fetus. Why don't you run the will man you run you're on

[00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.040]
They don't care about this your kids will kill the pizza. Yes

[00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:58.300]
No, no, they don't care about the little girl. I got shot by daddy's gun while he was diddling with it in the bathroom

[00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:59.980]
Now they've had a certain pause for

[00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:01.920]
Right there you go

[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:08.680]
Because the Lord told them to there another bunch of sick religious fanatic nuts well there everywhere brainwash man

[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.980]
Did you say the article I travel all over the world? I got news for it. There's very there are no civilized countries

[00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:19.060]
I mean we got the stone age countries, but there are no civilized countries where the religion is to take it over and

[00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.860]
Are as in much of control as what goes on as they are here?

[00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:24.780]
This is one of the most intolerant countries anywhere in the world

[00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.260]
I think religion in the damn pilgrims are rolling in their graves from what's going on here?

[00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:31.660]
Look at how liberal they were

[00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:37.080]
themselves the letter to the editor from the you're on law professor about the play case. No

[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.020]
Basically that's not show judge people did the right thing under the law. Oh, yeah, wait

[00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:48.720]
Get better, but ultimately trying place will have to judge in the court of God's bar. Oh, here we go

[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.760]
That's right. Let's wait for God to do it

[00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.420]
So let's all let all the people out there the murderers and the manslaughter guys

[00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:59.280]
Let's let them all just out there to play football and make millions of dollars because God eventually will take care of that

[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.800]
That's that's great. Yeah, so if we could only bring Hitler back to life

[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.600]
We could let him wander around out there to and wait to meet his maker

[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:12.600]
Jerry, you know, we're gonna go to Monticello and meet Marvin maker. Okay. Bye. Bye. Have a great life. Here's Miami. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir

[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:17.980]
Hey, I was going to okay. Hey, I was calling on on the topic of religion. Yeah

[00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:23.300]
I've literally for a few years and I called the call the several times of the past two three years and I graduated from a Catholic high school

[00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:30.380]
Uh-huh, and I was reading this a spin article by a by a writer who was off from freelance work for a for the times and just a

[00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:33.620]
In staff writer and it deals essentially with the

[00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:37.780]
Solopid priest and the plunge of you on it by the rule two

[00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:38.460]
God

[00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:45.160]
I always want to say I had quite a view of follow-all two of that my school although they never came on actually assaulted you

[00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:50.020]
I mean just from you know the lists and the touch on the shoulders and these were actually teachers

[00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:55.820]
Yes, but I run it for the first time I ever listened to you with that uh was in high school. Mm-hmm. I had actual normal teachers and uh

[00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:02.100]
I'm pretty normal as a normal who are impressed who are you know into little boys if you are at that time

[00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:04.320]
You know 14 to the age of 18 and uh

[00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:07.640]
As you're normal teachers and I was the first time I listened to you and just to get you a few quotes

[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:14.160]
She actually she spoke she went to the valigan spoke to a several leading scholars and montiniers about

[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:18.240]
About celibacy and priests and black up it and just read a couple quotes

[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:23.240]
It said two percent of Catholic priests went to perpetual celibacy achieve it and anywhere from 30 you know

[00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:29.620]
60% are gay now very very conservative estimate. Yeah, no, I'd say 60 to 90 percent. Yeah

[00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:33.320]
It's it's not like you know an exact science. This is based upon their opinion. Yeah

[00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:37.440]
And she says more than a thousand resigned every year to get married

[00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:40.560]
And on the topic of Italy since it's like you're adopted home

[00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:44.240]
One of them on seniors that she is she quotes several people in the actual article

[00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:49.520]
So one of them on seniors says that uh the Italian diastis has a fun to support priests illiterate children

[00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.960]
How do you like that? Yeah. Yeah quite interesting quite interesting

[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:57.900]
Fantastic goes to show you man at the church that the Catholic church. They we need got their head on straight

[00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:00.560]
They got their beanie on straight. They definitely got the head on. Yeah

[00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:03.980]
Somebody said yeah and in closing, I'd like to say uh

[00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:07.980]
James Retardo you're a douchebag. Okay pal. Okay. I'll stick here. Me just

[00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:12.960]
In the 50s Robert Young made people laugh and father knows best now

[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:20.500]
This great series is back starring a few Catholic priests who like it young in the return of father knows best

[00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:26.340]
Step into the confession or Billy. I don't know father. This makes the 47th time I've been in there this week

[00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:30.620]
Aw Billy. You want to be a good Catholic don't you? Yeah, but just everybody get a spanking

[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:37.960]
Father knows best. It's the Vatican's best kept secret and you've got a private see for all the fun

[00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:43.220]
Just enter the rectory from the rear. All right Billy boy. It's time for your flute lesson

[00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:48.680]
But father your flute has only one hole and it doesn't make it annoying. Oh, it will Billy. It will

[00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:56.040]
Father knows best once you've seen this new sitcom you'll wonder why you've never heard about it

[00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:57.800]
Let me introduce you to Saint Peter

[00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:06.120]
Father knows best going to church may not seem very entertaining, but there really is something funny going on here

[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:09.020]
Ladies and gentlemen may I have your attention please

[00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:16.620]
It's Father in Sunday here at the ballpark, so please let's have a round of applause for the fathers of what their young boys to the game

[00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:18.040]
Father Dominic

[00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:19.440]
Father O'Toole

[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:20.880]
Father Sebastian

[00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:22.700]
Father Matthias

[00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:28.760]
A lot of masturbation went off here's a lady in the gable. Hello. Hi Neil. Yes, ma'am

[00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:33.540]
This is well, I can't say my name because I don't want to football players coming in and busing down my door. I've beaten you up

[00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:37.020]
Okay, as you can can guess I go to you am raw. Oh

[00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:44.500]
I can't agree with you because all I have to say is you can recruit the athlete from

[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:49.900]
To inner city, but you can't take the inner city out the athlete. That's pretty much it. Is that it?

[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:53.140]
That's it. Well, how come we can't get some athletes who have a brain, you know

[00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:56.240]
It's too hard to balance. Oh the muscle and the brain

[00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:00.060]
Yeah, they're working on the wrong muscle. Yeah, that's true

[00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:04.540]
That's what I think Michael Irving's problem was he was working too much on the wrong muscle. Oh, yeah could be

[00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:09.580]
Yeah, okay. Good luck sweetheart. I think you'll find. Thanks. I but like I said the American public is numb

[00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:13.060]
They have been desensitized to anything no matter what it is

[00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:16.900]
I mean the stories you see on the news if we saw these stories 15 20 years ago

[00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:21.120]
We would have said boy that's just unbelievable now. It's just business as usual

[00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:24.860]
You know guy kills the kid with the or the grandma 41-year-old grandma

[00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:28.800]
Strangles the kid puts her in a freezer guys go ahead and with his a little piece in the bathroom

[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:36.980]
He's playing with his new play toy his gun and it goes off and but I think I didn't know the gun was loaded his 10-year-old kid is dead and on and on and on and on and on and on

[00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:41.900]
It just the never stops. That's America for you baby and the public says hey, we can handle anything. We don't care

[00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:46.440]
We're indifferent. We're actively empathetic. It's not just a Florida thing. It's an American thing

[00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:52.160]
The old one in radio frequency weaponry WIOD Miami Fort Lauderdale

[00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:58.820]
Views talking in a tape that radio 610 WIOD it's big deal. It's big in a boat

[00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:05.660]
So there's casts on the ground that I'm singing to her and then I have to do call Wilkinson who's about to sing Danny boy

[00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:13.140]
Now be quiet. I'm gonna sing Danny boy. Oh

[00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:16.160]
Oh

[00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:17.120]
God

[00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:23.300]
Problem big big problem you got so much

[00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:27.560]
Those things are stop and go stop and go oh

[00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:34.800]
Just stop it okay, and how about this thing with the the pizza hot shooting

[00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:39.360]
Do you see that not only did the second worker die after a two-day fight for life?

[00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:45.300]
It says in a headline, but the one of the one of the murderers one of these scumbags that did the shooting was

[00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:50.660]
Living at their house because he had no did you you didn't see that his good friend had lived with

[00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:55.120]
Preston what the hell is this guy's name Clyde Kane Preston who shot him

[00:10:55.780 --> 00:11:01.320]
Had lived with Jackson his mother when he had no other place to go so as a reward he comes back and he and his

[00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:07.480]
Pal partner in crime they hold up the place they shoot and kill of this guy and the other guy you talk about scumb

[00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:10.940]
You talk about the trash of the earth man. This is just

[00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:16.360]
But hey nobody cares about it like I said why the hell should I nobody gives a crap because human life in America

[00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:20.080]
It's like stepping on a stepping on a roach after somebody else smoked it

[00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:23.780]
So what can you tell you just more scum out there all over the place and that you know

[00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:27.560]
I was saying to Rick on the way out which they ran out of here like I can't blame them but

[00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:34.640]
That thing about people's aromas and people body odorance now if this was any place but here

[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:40.500]
But a parochial hicktown like Miami every line in the board would we have out the 40 hour conversation on that

[00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:43.700]
Because it's true. It's not something I made up. It's the truth

[00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:48.520]
But because most of you a big outing like if you live in South Miami a big outing is maybe up to

[00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:52.020]
You know the datebroward line or if you live in like

[00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:56.160]
Coral Gables a big outing is a trip to the sawgrass and that's it

[00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:00.520]
That's the extent of like where most of these people have been and especially at this time of the year

[00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:04.760]
Because most of the people that do get around and go somewhere guess what there wherever the hell they go

[00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:09.680]
And more power to them and I wish I was there wherever the hell it is by the way the best smelling people are Colombians

[00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:12.900]
Oh, man, what what does that mean? I have never smelt the whole oh

[00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:16.220]
I'll tell you one thing though. You don't necessarily want to get too close

[00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:19.480]
But man, especially in Medellin, but boy they sure smell good

[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.180]
Mm-hmm. They got that smooth silky tan that with that olive complexion

[00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:27.080]
You know we get a facts here finally we got somebody out there her name is nirvana alleged

[00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:28.780]
Lately probably dances up the street

[00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:34.280]
It says the main reason people smell strange to each other is because it was nature's way to preserve the purity of the races

[00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:37.060]
It starts in the old factory part of the nose

[00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:43.400]
It starts in the old factory what can you imagine what they smell like in the old factory white people smell like wet dogs to black people

[00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:47.540]
Black people smell like death to whites. It's just the way it is baby is what she say

[00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:53.340]
That's the reason I would never date a black man says nirvana the smell is overwhelming the may she says

[00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:58.140]
And she also goes on to say I love my Colombian boyfriend. How do you like that?

[00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:02.620]
You are so right to say that they smell and taste as sweet as honey

[00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:06.840]
And I eat every morsel of his white silky hard flesh. She says

[00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:13.580]
Willie feels exactly willie what kind of a yeah is that wet willie feels exactly like I do about the smell of

[00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:15.880]
Oh, it's he saying grájo is that what she said?

[00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:20.980]
Yuck she says hi willie. I love you and I'm hungry baby and that's what she says and I'm thinking the same thing

[00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:23.240]
Thanks for letting me release my true what's that around

[00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:27.900]
Okay nirvana sweetheart the good stuff is starting to come in on the facts now baby

[00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:31.260]
Here's one we got two pieces of crap. Here's one. It says uh

[00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:36.900]
No substantial worth to moron on the year from some asshole at panasonic facts

[00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:40.420]
By the way with no phone number on their thing they probably can't afford one

[00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:46.360]
You ever think before you speak? I enjoyed your panthers commentary which is when I was first introduced to you

[00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:53.300]
However since I found you to be a moronic butthead you ridiculed people before they speak are you afraid of a real challenge?

[00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:57.580]
Yerko you know my son watches this cartoon picky in the brain

[00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:02.840]
picky in the brain in one episode the brain is a comedian whose views insults

[00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:08.700]
Obviously that your show is a comedy and that's yeah it ends like in mid-sentence because they couldn't afford enough paper or whatever

[00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:13.400]
Unsigned of course unsigned at panasonic facts systems wherever the hell they are

[00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:20.480]
See that's another one of those jackasses who thinks we're gonna sit here and talk hockey every day or talk a kaka good get lost

[00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:24.020]
We don't want your type okay. We don't want your kind with no sense of humor

[00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:29.540]
And yes, the answer is I don't ever think before I speak I don't get paid to think I get paid to sit here and be a jackass

[00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:35.380]
And do a great job of it okay, and by the way, I just put a big big fat check into my wallet okay?

[00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:41.180]
How you doing here's one from some malcontentant Carolina mountain water in the Palm Beach County no less

[00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:43.520]
Where we don't get calls of course most of the time from them

[00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:45.420]
But this idiot's belly-ick and then again

[00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:49.220]
Signed someone with something to say who couldn't get through but don't have the balls to put a name on here

[00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:50.140]
Even if I made one up

[00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:55.060]
Sorry, I've been too busy to call from my perspective your ratings numbers were down for only one reason

[00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:58.640]
You've always believed that chronic colors were the kiss of death for a talk show and you're right

[00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:00.360]
However, there were days I couldn't listen

[00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:08.860]
But it wasn't the chronic sort of hockey talk. It was to give away beggars day after day of tickets medallions hats rats shirts posters and on and on and on and on

[00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:12.400]
On hello, Neon your show is great. Can I have panther tickets? Hey Neil

[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:16.060]
I'm a woman who listens. Give me the tickets. Oh, I pay it says here. Oh

[00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:21.160]
I think I'd rather listen to the dentist bill carts for four hours. Oh the dentist bill card

[00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:24.140]
Yeah, we got that then the fake callers from that couple of months

[00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:27.360]
Please, I beg you leave the giveaways to Rick and suds and then it says

[00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:31.660]
Signed someone something. Yeah, okay couldn't get through my ass man

[00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:34.940]
You can get through on this station right about these days in a half a second

[00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:36.880]
We have an open line right now in date county

[00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:39.060]
Look at that if you cared enough to send you very best

[00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:42.900]
You just don't have the balls to do it. That's all you got something important to say. Let's hear it

[00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:46.840]
I agree with you about those snores out there nobody hates that worse than I do

[00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:48.720]
But hey when you got a budget, huh?

[00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:53.040]
Except George because then he's got to write down all the names and numbers and shoe size and breast and penis sizes

[00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:55.640]
And to dress all the envelopes and put a bunch of crap in it

[00:15:55.640 --> 00:16:01.200]
It's a time-consuming budget garbage and 99% of the people never even have the decency to call back and say hey

[00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:07.960]
I got your crap in a mail. Thank you so much, but the 10% who do are very nice then the 10% who do we do appreciate for the other 90%

[00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:13.080]
To you too, okay? There's a good intellectual comment for you who wants substance, okay?

[00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:15.180]
If you want substance turn on mr. Ego

[00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:18.280]
He'll give you another one of his diet tribes about how everybody who's liberal

[00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:25.380]
The left of it's all of the hon should be shot immediately if not sooner because Rick citerman converted him into an immediate self-hating Nazi

[00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:31.240]
Or whatever the story is over there turn on that direct for about five minutes and then you'll come you'll come racing back here like your life

[00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:33.320]
Depended on it. That's how fast you'll be back

[00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:36.360]
I love these people who dislike whatever it is that we're doing

[00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:42.780]
But instead of just finding something else to listen to something to watch some other occupation some hobby Russian who let

[00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:47.300]
Partizi whatever it is yankin themselves whatever it might be instead of doing that

[00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:52.900]
They got to give us a big song of the day and take time out of their very very busy lives to let us know how upset they are

[00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:55.120]
As if we really care we don't care

[00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:58.860]
And right now the way things are in is to it. We especially don't care

[00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:01.300]
They'd lines all open. It must be busy in dayd

[00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:20.180]
Here's a hollywood hello

[00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:23.720]
Yes, sir back to you. How are you great?

[00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:26.860]
Did you have any idea that Jim managed with a go-ned licking queer?

[00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:31.500]
And you know, as he says it real quick and he hangs up like we don't know that already

[00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:33.840]
I mean what do you get so nervous about everybody knows that

[00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:36.240]
It's the best of Neil Rogers

[00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:39.300]
Well, all right sports fans

[00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:42.160]
The rumors are still rampant at wio.d

[00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:45.180]
As to who will do what shift? Yeah

[00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:49.660]
We're really not at liberty to say but if you people are very perceptive you'll pick up little clues

[00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:51.920]
Now here's our announcer to tell you more

[00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:55.640]
And Rick and science to the 60M on news talking entertainment radio

[00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:57.740]
610 wio.d

[00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:00.700]
610 wio.d

[00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:04.180]
It's the new Roger show on tape with all the states removed

[00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:16.940]
Well, we were out on our first day

[00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:21.240]
After eating at a Mexican cancass bay

[00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:25.540]
Oh, we were driving in my car

[00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:29.560]
Let one go that almost blew us both away

[00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:37.520]
I asked her to do cut the cheese that she turned around to look at these

[00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:39.540]
That girl's own parts

[00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:46.980]
Girls don't part because I don't need that girl's own part but I do

[00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:50.020]
The older her the

[00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:53.800]
It's through my clothing in my hair

[00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:59.360]
And so I rolled the windows down so I could get some air

[00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:02.520]
It's felt like something died in there

[00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:06.440]
Girls don't part

[00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:13.820]
Girls don't part she can't tell me that girl's own part but I do

[00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:19.340]
I heard another deadly squirt

[00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:23.480]
Then I held my nose and covered it with my shirt

[00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:27.880]
I turned around to get her back

[00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:32.280]
With just a matter of time before another attack

[00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:36.420]
So I asked if she was okay

[00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:38.340]
That she looked at me

[00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:42.120]
That also had the same one's girl's own part

[00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:46.960]
Girls don't part because I don't need that girl's own part

[00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:49.520]
But I do

[00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:54.780]
Girls don't part

[00:19:55.980 --> 00:20:02.500]
Girls don't part because I don't need that girl's own part but I do

[00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:05.280]
But I do

[00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:09.860]
But I do

[00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:11.920]
How far is it out?

[00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:15.040]
I don't know nobody named Kirby Brooks am I supposed to know that? Hello

[00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:16.880]
I knew yeah

[00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:29.680]

I'm W I N C radio

[00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:37.440]
It's not the best KOTL but cable works overlooking this game. How are you?

[00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:40.800]
Nobody at a earlier Kirby I don't know who you are

[00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:44.080]
Nobody does I went up the air in 1958 like I said

[00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:45.660]
Did you work with Jerry Wichner?

[00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:47.640]
Nobody worked with Jerry Wichner. Yeah I did

[00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:49.780]
Jerry Wichner was created in a studio

[00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:53.780]
So what's the story Kirby what are you trying to make your comeback is that it?

[00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:57.720]
I'm the only other live personality on the radio today besides

[00:20:57.720 --> 00:20:58.900]
No you're not pre-

[00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:02.560]
Live and personality I think both were stretching it in your case Kirby

[00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:04.240]
The K L W

[00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:07.160]
What are you doing? What station are you allegedly on?

[00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:08.800]

What station are you allegedly on?

[00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:12.120]

Oh man that was a good start like I told you George where a couple of real suckers

[00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:30.380]
I know that opens up a lot of avenues there

[00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:34.060]
That's our first call of the day that should give you a real good idea what we have left in this town

Why do we why do we give a flying crap about Riva mac entire?

[00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:55.700]
Why? Why? They're probably one of those drunks that goes to the drugs. They're not true. Drunk the drug. Yeah, yeah

How do you like that? And she wants to know if Riva's coming back. Thank God she don't watch the guiding lighter

[00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:42.660]
I'd know what's going off the year one thing we've discovered again today especially is we got more dead heads out there for a square inch

Choming in pleasant in a quite friendly way

[00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:39.300]
A sense of humor to make someone chuckle

[00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:43.820]
I so mean they cause women's needs of a goal

[00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:46.500]
He was caught by cops in Hollywood

[00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:51.540]
They say that he was up to no good

[00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:58.440]
Been done that probably any cause the big mob when you got a hooker and got a

[00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:03.300]
And get a job

[00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:06.720]
In the back she went down on his

[00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:14.340]
Stop broke it up. They saw her head pop when you got a hooker and got a

[00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:19.340]
English don't have sex they drink too much tea

[00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:22.740]
Unless you're part of the royal family

[00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:30.240]
But you read not like that he's no regal snob so we got a hooker. He got a

[00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:34.240]
Get a hooker and get a

[00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:38.460]
In the back that you went down on his

[00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:45.180]
Cop broke it up. They saw her head pop when you got a hooker

[00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:47.220]
They got a

[00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:53.200]
Yeah

[00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:04.780]
It's the best of Neil Rogers

[00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:08.140]
610 W I O D

[00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:12.800]
It's the best of Neil Rogers edited from broadcast to Puritans and fools

[00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:21.040]
Oh more women than ever are joining today's US Army and they're doing it for all kinds of reasons

[00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:26.520]
This is for coach Barb who kept me in the big game and who kept me in the shower room after all the other girls went home

[00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:29.700]
And for all the kids it's cool about a mean most likely a poor concrete

[00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:33.800]
My family who used to say there wasn't anything a man could do that I couldn't do better

[00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:36.420]
That's fair when it being the most of all for myself

[00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:40.360]
Who's proud of the idea of living in a barracks and 50 other women just like me

[00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:44.200]
If you can't be a man be the next best thing be a woman in today's US Army

[00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:48.580]
Let me ask you this question if you ever wondered why most dikes are so obvious couldn't be the haircut good it

[00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:53.920]
You think that's the tip off is the haircut the real real short the extra short butch haircut

[00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:57.340]
Does anybody out there read this book by Vincent Boyosi?

[00:27:57.340 --> 00:27:59.540]
I think it just came out in the bookstore is just a few days ago

[00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:01.900]
And I'm like about halfway through it outrage

[00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:05.980]
If you read one book in your lifetime if you have somebody else read it to you

[00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:08.000]
Which probably will be necessary in most of your cases

[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.640]
This should be the one you should be racing to your bookstore right now because you know the power that I got

[00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:15.980]
Even though we can't get anybody to call they're out there make no mistake about that

[00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:18.000]
They were hanging on every turd and every word

[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.400]
They're going to be out there cleaning the shelves of the bookstores from this book

[00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:25.460]
Because trust me when I tell you no matter how sick and tired you may have been in the OJ business

[00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:30.300]
This has got all the stuff in it that the jury probably should have heard although it shouldn't have been that jury

[00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:36.000]
And also by the way the change of venue moving the trial to downtown biggest mistake in history number one

[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:40.920]
And then number two marsher firing the consulting firm that they hired see both sides hair consultants

[00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:47.000]
But chief hired a consulting firm just before they picked the jury and they had done all this study and all the

[00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:50.620]
You lay to famous black man they admired

[00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:54.480]
So guess what we wind up with mostly on the jury black women nice go on marsher

[00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:58.380]
All right now of course we go through all of the stuff all the evidence that wasn't introduced

[00:28:58.380 --> 00:29:02.540]
Including the passport in the eighty seven hundred dollars in cash that fell out of out cowling's pockets

[00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:07.120]
And the disguise and the scheme asking all the other stuff which wasn't just rumor it was all in there

[00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:12.340]
The only problem is nobody ever heard it because the prosecution and then so what is the prosecution get after they blow this thing

[00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:17.700]
And they let a murderer walk free they get all kinds of TV and book contracts and they wind up being big celebrities

[00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:22.040]
Hey congratulations on being total incompetence Chris Darden marsher Clark nice call it

[00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:27.200]
There's American justice for you baby Vincent Bualio so you can pronounce it however you want

[00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:31.220]
But you better damn well buy the book. Yeah, it's fellow legosi by the way you and Rick were both wrong

[00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:36.920]
What are you talking about always silly's thing this morning about what the conversation about how to pronounce his name his name is

[00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:41.900]
Like he says it right exactly like familia that's an Italian word you don't say familia

[00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:46.020]
It was like tatalia which is really how you would pronounce you wouldn't say tatalia

[00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:48.620]
Although at a couple of times during the movie because there are a bunch of

[00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:52.620]
Non-Italian guys trying to pretend to be Italian because it's a movie okay, it's friction

[00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:57.960]
I mean it is so clear cut and then of course for the a handful of idiots out there that keep for either ethnic

[00:29:57.960 --> 00:30:00.360]
And then stuff about firm and it's pretty interesting too

[00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:06.320]
Did you know he dated a Hispanic girl and then he had a black partner in the cop car for a period of time

[00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:13.220]
That he got along with great and also a Hispanic female that was his partner for like by his request and they got along with them all great

[00:30:13.220 --> 00:30:16.620]
The only the only ethnic minorities he despised were scumbags

[00:30:16.620 --> 00:30:23.100]
What a surprise that is find in a cop that can't stand scumbags out there in the streets whether they're black or Hispanic or white or whatever

[00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:24.520]
They are crap heads

[00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:26.100]
But I'm not saying that he's a saint

[00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:28.900]
But he sure isn't what they the picture that they painted for you out there

[00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:32.360]
But hey that again is because of the great job that they did there in a prosecution

[00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:38.220]
They were the best at money couldn't buy they stunk the joint out and Gilgar said he throw his ass right in here too

[00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:43.920]
Because when he let him put the thing in that their downtown LA where the jury pool was bound to be overwhelming

[00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:49.000]
We released very high percentage of black that was the end of it where we're just basically done right there

[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:53.620]
Here's for it here's gone here is Elton six hello. Hello. Yes, sir

[00:30:54.180 --> 00:30:56.320]
I have a lot to say about the old system

[00:30:57.280 --> 00:31:03.580]
It's a waste. Yes, one thing first of all let me say this about this book that's we've been expounding all morning

[00:31:03.580 --> 00:31:08.580]
Yes, have you have you read it? No, I have no intention to read next one. I because for them

[00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:14.160]
It's just a bunch of sensational lives of trash. How do you know that based on what I've heard this guy

[00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:15.280]
So I've heard it debate

[00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:19.420]
Attorney on a rather one night. What's your attorney was that?

[00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:24.700]
Dersuit they are they had Alan Dershowitz. Yes. Yes, and

[00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:27.080]
I was I said it just a bunch of soup the trash

[00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:30.820]
When I think how do you know that if you haven't read the book well when I think of a book

[00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:32.100]
I think of something that

[00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:36.320]
Takes a lot of deep thought from time and research. You just don't write a book overnight

[00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:41.260]
Not only would I read will not read his book. I would not read any other of anybody who's involved this block

[00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:42.900]
All that is yeah, have you read the book?

[00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:48.180]
Keltor Skelter which you he wrote about the his prosecution Charles Manson have you read that no? No, and I have no intention

[00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:51.640]
Why is that are you also a Charles Manson defender to no? No?

[00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:54.600]
Well, let me probably not because he was white is not what it's all about well

[00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:57.740]
Let me say the situation I might have fascinating that a black man from Fort Pierce

[00:31:57.740 --> 00:32:01.160]
Makes the ever to call all the way down here because you want to a trash

[00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:04.120]
A guy that wrote a book that you didn't read because it lies in the face of the facts

[00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:09.440]
Okay, well, let me let me be another old a black oj apologists. Well, let me say this like like most Jews and like most white people

[00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:15.200]
You change the thing. Oh, they're guilty. Oh like most Jews. How do you know if you've done a survey of the Jews and like most black

[00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:19.280]
I tend to think the man is and how do you know that most Jews think he's guilty if you've taken a survey?

[00:32:19.380 --> 00:32:21.580]
Most of the one that I feel speaking up concerning this trial

[00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:25.040]
Well, let me ask you something didn't you just quote to me Alan Dershowitz?

[00:32:25.460 --> 00:32:29.740]
Is he Jewish? Yes. How about Robert Shapiro? Oh, you don't know what he thinks

[00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:32.980]
You know, you never he waffles back and forth you know, he he depends the man

[00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:37.280]
Oh, so another is he was he was he helped to get him off, but he's not the good you okay? In other words

[00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:42.700]
Dershowitz is the good you well guess what there there are a lot of people that think that Dershowitz also believes that he was guilty

[00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:47.460]
You sell okay, well, let me let me move on to my point. So I guess maybe you're right most of us Jews think he was guilty

[00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:51.440]
Let me move on and most white people. Yeah, let me move on to my point. Had I been a Jewel

[00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:57.400]
There's no way based on the way this trial was presented that old gay Simpson would that I could have found him guilty

[00:32:57.400 --> 00:33:03.620]
Yeah, well, it's not interesting because that's what Vincent Bolioce says here that the the prosecution was incompetent

[00:33:03.620 --> 00:33:07.760]
Yeah, but let me let me move on but you don't want to hear that right? Let me move on

[00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:11.640]
You don't want to be confused you don't want to be confused with the facts. That's the problem

[00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:15.500]
Okay, you haven't read the book. You're not gonna read the book because you don't want to be confused with the facts

[00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:20.340]
Which he lays out very eloquently and very clearly that your opinions there. No, it's not my opinion

[00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:23.500]
It's in the book. I got the books right in my hand right now in the book, too

[00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:28.740]
And you have good reading for you. Yeah, let me let me say it. Good riddance to what I say good reading oh, I see

[00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:31.740]
As I was saying first of all the prosecution never

[00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:35.680]
Convents me yet of emotive no, no, the fact that he threatened to kill her

[00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:40.120]
I didn't mean it. We don't know how many times plus the fact that he beat the crap out of her over and over again

[00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:42.380]
That's not a motive of course not it is not a motive

[00:33:42.380 --> 00:33:46.760]
No, and the fact that he would have an alien jealous and stalker that's not a motive of course not

[00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:51.920]
It's not a motive right people do that all the time and then that's that on that people beat the crap out of their wives all the time

[00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:55.280]
And never and that doesn't that says me that they killed her. Yeah, no

[00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:59.500]
Are you also an apologist for that the fact that he was a wife beaters? That was that okay, too?

[00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:03.920]
Based on what I know and what I've heard he only beat him maybe once no wrong and if he did

[00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:07.980]
No, I'm not a apologize and I don't and what if he did only beat her one did you

[00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:11.560]
So did you watch any of the trial did you see the pictures that were black and blue?

[00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:16.440]
You think that those pictures were staged. I won't think they were airbrushed. I watched very little

[00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:19.720]
Yeah, in other words you didn't read the book you didn't watch the trial

[00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:22.660]
But you know he was black and therefore he didn't do it. Okay. Thank you so much

[00:34:22.660 --> 00:34:25.520]
And you wonder why there's so much racism they call it racism

[00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:31.620]
I think it's just realism is what it is if I had a dollar for every really ignorant dumb black person in America

[00:34:31.620 --> 00:34:34.820]
I wouldn't have to be sitting your waist in my time talking to assholes like him every day

[00:34:34.820 --> 00:34:41.560]
How about buying a book? How about getting smart? How about learning something instead of just acting based on gut reaction?

[00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:47.940]
Okay based on ethnic need and they starts out with a bit about the Jews and the white so there was nothing in there was there

[00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:54.040]
Huh the Jews most of the Jews and the whites most of you people in high-meet town you think he was guilty

[00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:57.300]
You know all you people that gave all that money to the NAACP right?

[00:34:57.520 --> 00:35:00.020]
Well the Spix think he did it too. Oh the Spix how do you like that?

[00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:01.960]
No, it's damn Spix they think he's guilty too

[00:35:02.460 --> 00:35:04.400]
It's the best of Neil Rogers

[00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:14.380]
610 W I O D playing tapes of Neil Rogers because there's a hockey game on satellite and Neil's busy

[00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:16.800]
Oh man. Here's a mobile in Hollywood. Hello

[00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:21.980]
Yeah Neil. Yes sir. Have you ever considered the fact that he's innocent

[00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:26.620]
And also that because of the what does that mean? What kind of a question is that?

[00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:27.100]
Well

[00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:29.560]
Because you supposed to be proven

[00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:34.100]
guilty and and and and you and you supposed to be innocent until proven guilty

[00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:38.560]
So let's say he was innocent and being a black man in America you know

[00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:41.740]
That you're not going to get justice in this country

[00:35:43.180 --> 00:35:51.040]
Wait a minute black people never get justice never I can't how about black people like I've 10 million dollars to spend on their defense

[00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:56.480]
Well, let me let me make my point first of all the reason he was in that

[00:35:57.340 --> 00:36:01.440]
The guy was more than likely scared to death that he wasn't going to get justice

[00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:07.540]
So he figured the best thing to do was to skip town and to try and deal with it from another country

[00:36:07.540 --> 00:36:12.000]
Let me ask you this if you were innocent if you were innocent. Why would you be scared to death?

[00:36:12.460 --> 00:36:17.340]
Well, you have to understand this being a black man in this country is just like every time you get pulled over

[00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:18.080]
You you're

[00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:21.940]
Let me ask you this question is every black that's accused of a violent crime innocent?

[00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:22.840]
Of course not

[00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:29.200]
So then what kind of crap are you talking man? I'm talking the same kind of crap where you that you're talking if you would just listen for a second

[00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:34.440]
All I'm saying to you is the explanation is very valid why he was in that van

[00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:39.200]
It's very simple. How about the explanation of how his blood was at the crime scene. Huh? How about it?

[00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:42.280]
The explanation of the crew Mark Farman setup. Come on

[00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:47.920]
Mark Farman setup. How do you do that? How do you do that? He did it very simply

[00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:51.100]
Yeah, very simply. Yeah, when he got the magic one. Yeah

[00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:52.740]
No, when he got the blood

[00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:59.060]
How did he get the how did he get the blood inside OJ's house very simply when they went into his house and jumped the fence

[00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:02.420]
They had access to his whole house. Yeah, that was very easy

[00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:03.460]
So all he had to do

[00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:07.640]
Farman knew that and his line. He knew OJ was guilty

[00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:12.320]
So what he figured was this I'm gonna make sure this guy gets nailed for this

[00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:15.000]
Yeah, oh yeah, right. He was gonna go ahead

[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:19.900]
You know there's there's an interesting there's a very interesting story in this book

[00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:25.680]
Which I'm sure you won't read about a black I'm right to book about the black defendant that Farman made sure

[00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:27.160]
Give that he knew was not guilty

[00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:31.220]
And he made sure that the evidence was introduced to get him off because he knew he hadn't committed the crime

[00:37:31.220 --> 00:37:34.380]
So what was it that Mark Farman only was selectively racist?

[00:37:34.580 --> 00:37:37.680]
He only didn't like OJ is that what you're telling me what other black guys

[00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:39.280]
He helped him to get off when they weren't guilty

[00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:46.000]
Whoever was available to help him nail that black guy. Yeah, whether he was another black guy or whatever

[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:50.800]
What is that what what does that mean? What did you just say what are those words that you just uttered mean? What does that mean?

[00:37:51.020 --> 00:37:55.720]
This is very simple. Well, you keep playing it's very simple, but you're talking Kaka you're talking double

[00:37:55.720 --> 00:38:03.360]
I'm a farmer needed to help up whether he's black or not. Yes. Yes. He used another black guy to help him do what?

[00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:08.400]
What you just said yeah, let me ask you the name of the books. What's the name of the book? I agree to book

[00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:10.220]
You just got your senior read the book

[00:38:11.060 --> 00:38:14.900]
Yeah, you're full of crap. You're just another militant. Koon is what you are man

[00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:18.100]
I'm so sick and tired of guys like you. Let me say it again

[00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:21.640]
There's black people who are thinking people and then there's dumb coons okay?

[00:38:21.820 --> 00:38:23.280]
Just like in every other ethnic group

[00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:27.920]
I'm sick and tired of of walking his fine line. I'm telling them exactly the way I feel about it

[00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:33.940]
I'm sick and tired of that element of the so-called black community who are nothing but a want your a bunch of professional walking

[00:38:33.940 --> 00:38:37.200]
Ethnics okay get the chip off your shoulder and use your brain

[00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:40.940]
Use your brain if you can find one and he tells me he read the book

[00:38:40.940 --> 00:38:44.780]
He wouldn't know how to read the book. He wouldn't know where to go to find it or the book

[00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:50.700]
Man am I sick of this crap the koon ising of America baby. That's what we got under for the right in front of our face

[00:38:50.700 --> 00:38:58.140]
Right in front of our eyes is this taken dumb dumb uneducated people and trying to have to bring ourselves down to that level

[00:38:58.140 --> 00:39:01.600]
Okay, and you see it in sports you see it in every aspect of American life

[00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:04.680]
And I'm fed up right to my ears with it. Okay. I've had it

[00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:09.500]
If I get my point across or what and the thing that really gets me because the only time we ever get many black

[00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:13.100]
Caulers on here is once you start with something like this oj crap and it get the you know

[00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:18.440]
Get all bent out of shape because it's an ethnic thing to them as opposed to like you know common sense as opposed to justice

[00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:24.580]
And the thing that really makes it bizarre is when you read like pages 142 through 145 and you're about Jim Brown a former

[00:39:24.580 --> 00:39:27.440]
A football player who is very much involved in black causes

[00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:33.040]
He would be the first one to tell you that oj has never been at any time in his life involved in black causes

[00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:38.100]
Or helping the black community and Johnny Coffin gets up there in his summation and goes on about how oh yeah

[00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:40.920]
He even gave a bunch of money to the angel city links

[00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:45.660]
$5,000 a year to the angel city links the inner city black organization and of course

[00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:48.740]
Vincent bullioe he had to turn like a heads

[00:39:48.740 --> 00:39:51.740]
He had to go crazy to try to find out what the angel city links was

[00:39:51.740 --> 00:39:57.340]
Well, guess what? It's a sorority that his daughter was involved in it had nothing to do with helping people in the inner city

[00:39:57.340 --> 00:40:00.620]
It had nothing to do with black causes and when when bullioe

[00:40:00.620 --> 00:40:06.160]
C. S. Jim Brown when he go to oj and ask him for help for any of these black causes said I would I never waste my time

[00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:10.800]
Going to people that I know what the response is going to be and yet somehow you think that he was this

[00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:13.480]
Great hero this great black activist this great the

[00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:20.840]
I don't know what he was an uncle Tom and yet because of the fact that his skin color is black right away even with his 10 million dollars

[00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:23.480]
He could never get a fair shake. He got more than a fair shake

[00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:26.660]
He got away with double murders what he got away with plain and simple man

[00:40:26.660 --> 00:40:32.440]
Yeah, there's this whole thing with blacks in America and that is they would people become very successful whether it's Albert

[00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:36.740]
Bell or oj Simpson or Gary Schaeffyld or wherever it is making millions and millions of dollars

[00:40:36.740 --> 00:40:41.320]
There's still this attitude problem like what the hell more do you want somebody gave you an opportunity

[00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:47.440]
Somebody gave you a chance with very limited just based on athletics skills and very little between your ears to become a very wealthy person

[00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:53.100]
Now what the hell more do you want what's with the attitude what's with this incessant all the black people just can't make it

[00:40:53.100 --> 00:41:00.600]
They can't get a fair shake how about fags how about Jews how about the Spicks how about everybody else is everybody else crying all the time that they can't get a fair shake

[00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:06.560]
I think people are sick and tired of all a belly aching and the crying and want to start seeing and seeing people apply themselves with a brain

[00:41:06.740 --> 00:41:13.060]
Like read a book get smart get some intelligence and then go out and that's why all this affirmative action crap is going down the toilet

[00:41:13.060 --> 00:41:17.420]
Exactly if you want to compete for a job bring something like qualifications to it

[00:41:17.420 --> 00:41:22.560]
Don't tell me how you've been oppressed all this time and how you've been put upon because I'm sick and tired of hearing about that crap

[00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:26.800]
Give me somebody that's got some talent that I might give them a job maybe if they look good

[00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:31.940]
Here's Miami. Hello. How you doing? When is this you know you just nail it and it's incredible good

[00:41:31.940 --> 00:41:37.200]
I guess you have the power to do it on your radio show and nobody else has the balls in the stand to come out and nail it like it is

[00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:40.480]
Nobody has the guts to say because they're afraid they're gonna sound like a big it

[00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:43.280]
I'm not I just like decent people is there something wrong

[00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:47.320]
I like decent people people that are scumbags they can kiss my ass. I agree with you

[00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:52.900]
You know, it's just if you come out and you say was honestly the truth and maybe that the black community has some problems

[00:41:52.900 --> 00:41:57.920]
They got some real real serious problem or it's Phillips Mike Tyson you know always

[00:41:58.560 --> 00:41:59.120]
Whole thing down

[00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:10.580]
Mark Dupur it just go out and I'm we're talking about people that have been given an opportunity to make millions of dollars an opportunity that most black and white and yellow and any other people never have in their lifetime

[00:42:10.580 --> 00:42:16.560]
And these people have had things handed to them and they've still blown it well the thing that thing that drives me crazy is you know

[00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:27.900]
You look at Danny Rawlings Ted Bundy. We're not out there saying those guys were innocent right and I'm not

[00:42:27.900 --> 00:42:33.840]
Understand this that just because how about David Burpowitz he was Jewish so my sitting here as a Jew yelling and screaming that he was

[00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:37.980]
Discriminate against because he was a Jew what kind of cock I'm thinking is this well

[00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:40.860]
I said it was a white you judge you let Brian blades off though

[00:42:40.860 --> 00:42:44.820]
I just hope you're black call us remember that yeah that fits. Oh, he never had a fair chance

[00:42:44.820 --> 00:42:48.660]
That's a good point. How come all of a sudden? He's out there jumping high and running fast

[00:42:48.660 --> 00:42:54.740]
Well, you know what I mean? It's just amazing to me if you come out and even if you listen to the media nail and listen to the radio

[00:42:54.740 --> 00:42:59.240]
Radio shows if it if it's a white guy that gets beat up by a black guy

[00:42:59.240 --> 00:43:05.580]
It's buried it for some reason a white who cop goes after some black guys. It's from pace news. Oh we could go

[00:43:05.580 --> 00:43:08.840]
We had a week ago. We had this grotesque series

[00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:12.960]
Now I'm not saying it blacks are the only one who commit the violent crimes away at this grotesque series of crimes

[00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:19.240]
That were committed over the past weekend and 99% of who are all committed by black people including the guy that shot his daughter

[00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:24.480]
He was playing with his piece in the bathroom and they a gun went off and then he tried to say that his 10-year-old girl shot herself

[00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:29.400]
And then he admitted that he was the one that did it and the two kids that got murdered at pizza hut including the one kid

[00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:33.160]
His family took him in when he had no place to go. They took him it off the streets

[00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:35.880]
Well, what about the black guy who walked into the trailer over there

[00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:38.220]
Broward and shot all the white guys and it was a racist thing

[00:43:38.220 --> 00:43:39.580]
But it got buried in the paper

[00:43:39.580 --> 00:43:44.920]
You only saw one article and that whole event in that trailer where those guys got blown away. Yeah, I'm a black guy in a white guy

[00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:46.460]
Well, I think you're being a racist now

[00:43:46.460 --> 00:43:51.180]
You know, it's easy to say that because you know if you say the truth until you take it well

[00:43:51.180 --> 00:43:55.680]
Supposed to say the truth. This is America. You're supposed to sugarcoat everything so you don't offend anybody

[00:43:55.680 --> 00:44:01.380]
That's what America's all about until they take the covers off their eyes and realize we all believe red

[00:44:01.380 --> 00:44:06.880]
We're all the same you had enough time to sort of come up to society and read me to meet us there

[00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:08.600]
I think you nailed it right after the trial

[00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:11.640]
You said they don't want to sit in the back of us at a front. They just want to sit on their own side

[00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:13.760]
There you go. Yeah, have a great day pal

[00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:19.740]
And as soon as that guy from Fort Pierce started with yeah, all you Jews and whites think he's guilty all you Jews

[00:44:19.740 --> 00:44:22.140]
There we go. I wonder where he heard that crap, huh?

[00:44:22.460 --> 00:44:26.800]
Couldn't be from Jesse Jackson Lewis Farrakatta. We had a million idiots out there following a guy

[00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:32.100]
That's like the guy that gives me that crap about that that the Tony there from Kendall about how I'm a bigot

[00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:35.000]
I can't think of any religion more bigoted than the Muslims man

[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:40.700]
Look at the way that they treat women for example. There's a great job. Let's keep them in the Stone Age in the Stone Age

[00:44:40.700 --> 00:44:45.700]
One of the most the end of thought religions of all but because I don't think he ought to be sitting on his ass during the national anthem

[00:44:45.700 --> 00:44:49.940]
When he's getting paid millions of dollars a year to shove a basketball in a hoop then I'm a bigot

[00:44:49.940 --> 00:44:53.020]
I'm a bad guy. I think America has had it with this crap

[00:44:53.020 --> 00:44:58.420]
I think that the majority of people are sick and tired of everybody running around with an ethnic chip under God damn shoulder

[00:44:58.420 --> 00:45:03.040]
And I say that for myself and screw you guys my get my point across or what? Oh, man

[00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:04.800]
It's the best of Neil Rogers

[00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:07.600]
Simmy unplugged

[00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:13.740]
610 W I O D with the best of Neil Rogers on tape which is better than Larry King when he was alive

[00:45:13.740 --> 00:45:14.800]
I killed Nicole

[00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:17.480]
Wait till you now he this is right from the book page

[00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:19.320]
135 from the

[00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:25.560]
Vincid Bolewsy book which the people of course who've got their minds closed would never read because it might rattle their cage a little bit

[00:45:25.560 --> 00:45:31.780]
They don't want anything introduced into their brain if they can find one that might the challenge the preconceived notions that they got

[00:45:31.780 --> 00:45:38.700]
It said what has to rank is one of the most startling utterances to come from the prosecutors in the Simpson case was William Hodgman

[00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:44.620]
The senior member of the prosecution team telling the Los Angeles Times after the verdict that he and his coat

[00:45:44.620 --> 00:45:51.260]
Prosecutors and information about how Mark Furman as a detective was a very professional detective that in the number of instances

[00:45:51.260 --> 00:45:56.760]
He worked to clear suspects who happened to be African American when new evidence exonerating them came out

[00:45:56.760 --> 00:45:58.620]
But Bill if you had evidence like this

[00:45:58.620 --> 00:46:00.900]
Don't you think it would have been a good idea to share it with the jury?

[00:46:01.060 --> 00:46:05.560]
Bolewsy asks he says I was able to confirm one of these instances on October 6th

[00:46:05.560 --> 00:46:07.520]
The 1994 in West Los Angeles

[00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:12.220]
Sean Stewart a white male was shot to death on the street in a drug deal gun sour

[00:46:12.220 --> 00:46:21.980]
Witnesses identified Eric Harris a 30-year-old black male with a criminal history as the killer and firm in the lead detective on the case secured a criminal complaint against Harris for murder

[00:46:21.980 --> 00:46:23.760]
Before the preliminary hearing

[00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:28.280]
Furman got information that somebody else was the killer after going out and investigating further

[00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:34.660]
He formed the opinion that Harris was innocent his partner Ron Phillips told me that Furman worked extremely hard on the case to

[00:46:34.660 --> 00:46:38.120]
Establish that Harris was not involved. I remember Mark telling me Ron

[00:46:38.120 --> 00:46:41.600]
We've got approved this guy didn't do it before the preliminary is gonna sit in jail for a murder

[00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:47.420]
He didn't commit he even got the dea to request a continuance of the prelim so we could have more time to work on a case

[00:46:47.420 --> 00:46:49.160]
Furman proved Harris's innocence

[00:46:49.160 --> 00:46:55.400]
This is the black guy he proved his innocence and the district attorney's office had the case dismissed before the preliminary hearing

[00:46:55.400 --> 00:46:59.340]
Phillips said he furnished the prosecutors in a Simpson case with all of the above information

[00:46:59.340 --> 00:47:05.880]
But guess what they didn't introduce it with the revelations about Furman on the firm and tapes being perceived by everyone is devastating

[00:47:05.880 --> 00:47:07.120]
The prosecution's case

[00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:11.900]
It's almost criminal that the prosecution never introduced evidence like this to the jury

[00:47:13.100 --> 00:47:18.180]
Here's Miami. Hello. Yeah, yes sir. Oh Neil. Yes. Yeah, hi Neil listen

[00:47:18.180 --> 00:47:21.360]
The statements you made before about affirmative action

[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:28.180]
Was right on the money. Yeah, I agree with you on that, but I don't agree on the OJ trial, you know

[00:47:28.740 --> 00:47:31.820]
You know agree with what well a lot of things, you know

[00:47:31.820 --> 00:47:35.160]
I happen to have been free that time. I was watching the whole trial

[00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:37.460]
I'm white and I'm 60 years old

[00:47:37.940 --> 00:47:45.720]
So maybe I'm one of the rare rare people in the world and the guy was right a lot of my Jewish friends male friends

[00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:49.280]
Super week that he was guilty. Yeah, you know, so what does that mean?

[00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:52.480]
It means a lot to what his attorneys were Jewish

[00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:56.460]
You know the only you know the only reason he made the comment about Jews

[00:47:57.560 --> 00:48:01.020]
Well, I mean just attorneys are being paid, you know, let me say it again

[00:48:01.020 --> 00:48:08.000]
The only reason that the caller your friends stop breathing so heavy to the phone please the only reason that he made that comment is because

[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:11.840]
He's an anti-Semite and yet he's crazed crying about bigotry

[00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:16.160]
Wizard I watch the I watch the trial 90% at a time. Yeah, you know

[00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:24.020]
And I came to a lot of conclusions on my own did you did you watch when the criminalists from Connecticut the Chinese guy talked about the blood

[00:48:24.020 --> 00:48:26.240]
Yeah, and about terminal velocity

[00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:30.540]
Mm-hmm. Huh what about well that wasn't dramatic what about it?

[00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:37.920]
First of all there's tons of blood at the murder scene and there's only microscopic drops of blood around the other places

[00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:43.680]
Yeah, well most because most of the blood around a murder scene is from the victims. Do I have to spell that out for you?

[00:48:44.100 --> 00:48:48.820]
Yeah, but the but but the blood found in OJ's driveway was drops of blood

[00:48:48.820 --> 00:48:53.240]
Identical to the test drops he made in court terminal velocity

[00:48:53.240 --> 00:48:58.340]
If if a drop of blood was dropped from four inches or six inches from the ground

[00:48:58.340 --> 00:49:03.620]
It would make a small drop. Let me ask you this question. Oh, so in other words you're gonna give me this story about

[00:49:04.540 --> 00:49:06.940]
Conspiracy again how he was framed how well

[00:49:06.940 --> 00:49:13.860]
How we were where was the blood even the guys the guys who checked the truck the next day they they said

[00:49:13.860 --> 00:49:17.920]
What is the blood? Let me ask you lady would have you have you read this book?

[00:49:19.080 --> 00:49:20.660]
I'm very well read

[00:49:21.880 --> 00:49:29.140]
I'm not interested in how articulate how brilliant house pseudo intellectual you are have you read this book in which mr.

[00:49:29.300 --> 00:49:31.140]
Bulliose he goes down point by point

[00:49:31.140 --> 00:49:36.440]
Every one of the witnesses and where she goes down and addresses each of these issues have you read the book?

[00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:42.660]
That's my opinion to me. I'm asking you a question sir that requires I don't give a flying crap right now

[00:49:42.660 --> 00:49:46.300]
You already told us your opinion. I'm asking you a question. Have you read the book?

[00:49:46.420 --> 00:49:50.360]
I read some snippets of this book, but I didn't read his book. I don't read everybody's book

[00:49:50.360 --> 00:49:56.840]
I mean bullioces out to make money like everybody else. Yeah, I mean what like Bob your heroin like Johnny Coffin right?

[00:49:56.940 --> 00:50:04.800]
So the reference the reference the guy made before about bulliocese and and and firm and who who was who was trying to get this black

[00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:09.840]
Hot black person off because he felt he was innocent. Yeah, you know, so what's the big deal?

[00:50:10.020 --> 00:50:17.140]
You haven't had so the big deal is that if he was such a racist if he was the Hitler

[00:50:17.140 --> 00:50:22.860]
Which is what Johnny Coffin called him in summation if he was that much of a racist that much of a white supremacist

[00:50:22.860 --> 00:50:28.160]
Why would he do that? He's not a racist to that to that to that degree. How do you know that?

[00:50:28.340 --> 00:50:33.260]
They're what are you saying the what is he telling everybody else who's who has that little racism in them?

[00:50:33.380 --> 00:50:37.120]
Then why would he go to vote? Why would he go to such great likes to set up a lot of people's

[00:50:37.120 --> 00:50:43.000]
They sure let me ask you again if he wasn't a racist why would he set up a jet did he lose a bet on a football game or something?

[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:50.700]
He was he the man is a racist but he he can't stand black rich black men with white women. I know that yeah from what I read

[00:50:50.700 --> 00:50:55.060]
Mm-hmm. He also he was one of the one of the cops who was let me ask you this question

[00:50:55.060 --> 00:50:59.680]
OJ claimed that he was a cut-and-com self-in-shakago, right? Who knows about that cut?

[00:50:59.940 --> 00:51:06.180]
You just got through telling me that you watched almost the entire trial and I asked you one question and you can and you give me who knows about it

[00:51:06.180 --> 00:51:10.020]
Isn't that what he said? He cut himself in Chicago. Well, they they the whole tough

[00:51:10.020 --> 00:51:15.840]
They did verify that the glass was broken and let me ask that this land the glass let me ask you this if that's the case

[00:51:15.840 --> 00:51:20.420]
How come in his statement to the police which he made without the presence of his attorney in the statement

[00:51:20.420 --> 00:51:25.860]
Which is by the way in its entirety in the back of the book his statement to the police which was never introduced in evidence

[00:51:25.860 --> 00:51:32.840]
He says he cut himself peddling around the house rushing around to pack to go to Chicago the night before now

[00:51:32.840 --> 00:51:37.180]
Which is the truth and which is the lie sir? There was some there's there are some holes there

[00:51:37.180 --> 00:51:41.180]
I agree yeah, you know some hole. I mean basically there are some holes

[00:51:41.180 --> 00:51:44.760]
There's a lot like the big one in the middle of your forehead don't confuse me

[00:51:44.760 --> 00:51:46.860]
He's very well read. He's very well educated

[00:51:46.860 --> 00:51:53.980]
But he hasn't read it so don't confuse him with the fact because it's gonna fly in the face of the conclusions and the contusions that he's already come to okay

[00:51:53.980 --> 00:51:55.520]
guilty as hell

[00:51:55.520 --> 00:51:56.160]
two

[00:51:56.940 --> 00:52:01.500]
Roodle unacceptable acts two vicious murders of two people in the prime of their lives

[00:52:01.500 --> 00:52:04.180]
Whether you like them or you dislike them and of course one of them was Jewish

[00:52:04.180 --> 00:52:07.560]
So you know what's the big deal right man? You talk about ignorance out there

[00:52:07.560 --> 00:52:15.740]
And I rest my case which bullioce he doesn't agree with me this business of the jury system of people taking a bunch of dummies off the street and letting them make life

[00:52:15.740 --> 00:52:18.040]
And that's that decisions over innocent

[00:52:18.760 --> 00:52:24.000]
Many times innocent people and unacceptable how'd you like to have a jury composed of the last dozen people?

[00:52:24.160 --> 00:52:28.400]
We've talked to other the guy from Boston the guy from Fort Pierce this jackball right now

[00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:32.440]
Who's got some holes in his head and the holes in a story like this a piece of Swiss cheese

[00:52:32.440 --> 00:52:33.940]
But don't confuse him with a fact

[00:52:33.940 --> 00:52:40.980]
You call you a good company W.I.O.D. Miami Fort Lauderdale used all can entertain with radio

[00:52:41.560 --> 00:52:43.380]
610 W I.O.D

[00:52:44.040 --> 00:52:52.980]
Good afternoon. I'd want a clock on Jennifer Ram with 610 W I.O.D. News. I'm Jennifer Ram news talk and entertainment radio 610

[00:52:52.980 --> 00:52:55.580]
W I.O.D. Oh God

[00:52:56.520 --> 00:52:57.120]
Okay

[00:52:57.120 --> 00:52:57.980]
No good

[00:53:01.580 --> 00:53:07.640]
Attention, please we can't be responsible for what you're about to hear because we haven't heard it yet either

[00:53:07.640 --> 00:53:13.060]
Neal's on vacation. So here's the best of new Rogers on news talking entertainment radio

[00:53:13.880 --> 00:53:17.640]
610 W I.O.D. Yeah, so they're George

[00:53:17.640 --> 00:53:23.000]
Right exactly. We're both eating okay, so don't bother us. The worst talk radio I've ever heard my life with the W.I.O.D

[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:26.940]
Yeah, well blowing out your ass too, okay. Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello. A.D.O.

[00:53:27.400 --> 00:53:31.360]
I watched most of the trial. I do think he didn't have enough evidence to

[00:53:32.600 --> 00:53:36.800]
Um, the other thing is they didn't have enough evidence or they didn't reduce enough evidence

[00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:42.960]
I think they produced a lot some of it. No, they did not. No, they did not believe that again

[00:53:42.960 --> 00:53:46.040]
No, they did not which while reading this book in the first place

[00:53:46.040 --> 00:53:49.660]
Well, the book space on the premise of they that the prosecution ran a

[00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:53.480]
A crappy rotten cake. That's right. You can't blame that on a jury

[00:53:54.300 --> 00:53:59.480]
Who's blaming the jury? I well you do you said a bunch of idiots 10 minutes ago

[00:53:59.480 --> 00:54:03.160]
I got to you're saying that most Americans are idiots. I'm saying who would you entrust?

[00:54:03.300 --> 00:54:05.580]
I don't know do you want to trust a judge like the foe?

[00:54:05.700 --> 00:54:10.380]
How do you want this system to work? I wanted to run like they do in England where they have professional jurors

[00:54:10.380 --> 00:54:14.360]
Not a bunch of jackasses off the street like so what like lobo

[00:54:14.360 --> 00:54:16.900]
I said professional jurors not some jackass

[00:54:16.900 --> 00:54:22.940]
With those what do you mean where we go? How about if we educate some people? Okay. We sure got enough lawyers running around

[00:54:22.940 --> 00:54:24.640]
Yeah, too many well there you go

[00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:29.800]
Well, let me ask you let me ask something else. What about when they you know, you're a civil rights that would right when they jumped over

[00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:33.500]
What do we mean? I'm a civil rights guy. What does that mean? You believe in for people in this country

[00:54:33.500 --> 00:54:37.440]
Yeah, so when they jumped over a fence without a search warrant. Where are you on that one?

[00:54:37.500 --> 00:54:41.040]
What do you mean? We're on that one? I think they had air they had air be right to jump over the fence

[00:54:41.040 --> 00:54:45.280]
You can just enter somebody's house and search it if they thought that perhaps his life was in jeopardy

[00:54:45.280 --> 00:54:48.920]
Which is what they said they damn right they had a right that you go in there. Oh somebody's life was in jeopardy

[00:54:48.920 --> 00:54:50.540]
My goodness. You're really disappointing

[00:54:50.540 --> 00:54:53.780]
Well, did you watch that you just got through Tommy you watch the trial?

[00:54:53.960 --> 00:54:56.300]
Yes, I know you know that they just killed his wife

[00:54:56.300 --> 00:54:58.380]
They come and he just killed his wife

[00:54:59.100 --> 00:55:04.080]
Somebody killed his wife. They said nobody's home. Yeah, jump over and they do a complete search without a wife

[00:55:04.080 --> 00:55:11.220]
And suppose his body is laying there in the backyard. Then he's bleeding to death. They caught the police officers lying about

[00:55:11.220 --> 00:55:16.200]
About what they told the judge in order to jump the fence. Yeah, what about that? What about it? Well?

[00:55:16.600 --> 00:55:18.760]
So in other words, let's let them off on it

[00:55:19.140 --> 00:55:22.100]
Let's let them off on a technicality. Let's start word about civil rights

[00:55:22.100 --> 00:55:25.940]
How about the civil rights of the two people like I put you down? How about their civil rights?

[00:55:25.980 --> 00:55:31.400]
It's about technicality the jury the jury said they were he was innocent and you're second-guessing now and then thank you

[00:55:31.400 --> 00:55:36.640]
I'm second-guessing that the jury that we had one of the jurors set up and give the black power salute to OJ when they were now

[00:55:36.640 --> 00:55:38.680]
It's the verdict. Well, so what do you want?

[00:55:38.860 --> 00:55:45.140]
A judge? Oh, I said anybody you want. What do you want? I want a bunch of people to sit down including the black women

[00:55:45.140 --> 00:55:49.800]
You didn't watch the trial. Sure I did. How could you watch with your little show going on? We were watching it

[00:55:49.800 --> 00:55:53.880]
In other words, they didn't recap it every night. They didn't show hours and hours of it

[00:55:53.880 --> 00:55:56.460]
Recapped in show in other words, they know anything I would have said here

[00:55:56.460 --> 00:55:58.780]
I had to watch the whole trial to formulate an opinion right?

[00:55:58.780 --> 00:56:02.240]
You can't do it by reading all those books. No, I had to watch the whole trial

[00:56:02.240 --> 00:56:04.900]
Well, you had to watch it good far, but you bet. Yeah, how much?

[00:56:05.640 --> 00:56:07.800]
Two-thirds a lot of the evidence. How did you have?
