This is the brain

[00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.320]
You're not asking

[00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.820]
This traffic update is a service of the only sponsor we got

[00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:39.620]
It's a parking lot now and about better expressway. You know we got the usual delays. It's rush hour

[00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:45.800]
We got a few collisions one at 27. Davenue another one on 47. Davenue could be northbound. I don't know

[00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.880]
My peace outbound. I don't know that either

[00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.420]
Could be eastbound. We don't know we can see nothing from this room. It don't have the windows

[00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.100]
It's backed up on major problem all the way around the big curve and I'm not talking about my ass

[00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.880]
That's your eye is fine don't shoot me out of this guy a traffic from your traffic Chica as they yes

[00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:15.360]
Erranty any shortfall in the mid-tax driven use that are generated our players live in Broward County

[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.960]
You tell a bell practice drinkers in Broward County

[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.280]
Built to our home from day one has really been in Broward County

[00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:28.380]
We've never had a practice that the Miami arena. We don't have any business dealings there other than the nights we play our games

[00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:35.300]
Our entire future all of the planning for this franchise from day one has been towards an

[00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.740]
eventual building here in Broward to make it our home

[00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.800]
Now the Broward Commission can do one of three things they can say okay. Let's go forward with it arena

[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:49.500]
They can say okay. Let's don't go forward or they can put it on the table and discuss it later

[00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.860]
Whatever they decide will have it for you later coming up. Okay. Thanks. I think that's a good buddy

[00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.040]
I see man there's still they're still holding their meat

[00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.440]
So anyway getting back to the guy that Oshan provocateur the code at the end of the hour exactly

[00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:06.560]
Greg Fadek was just tell me that he and Jolie record the announcements for the Joe Robbie Stadium for the dolphin games

[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.520]
The ones that are played as you're walking into the stadium and you hear those voices that's a Fadek and Jolie

[00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.560]
She does this banal he does in glaze and

[00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:22.920]
Of course, it also made me stop and take pause and think about the sawgrass that when you do walk in like the white elephant or the yellow seahorse or the

[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.480]
Purple dinosaur or the

[00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.160]
green rectusaurus entrance that

[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.240]
What are you laughing about?

[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.260]
That they have all those recordings in multiple languages. Okay, exactly

[00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.440]
Exactly

[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.880]
But I still think the guy had a good point. What do we need to program an esponial for okay?

[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.100]
We're gonna like have it in Chinese now too pretty soon. You'll have a program that'll wait like 50 pounds

[00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.400]
Thank God at least a fix right at short. It's short believe me. I've seen him

[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:56.480]
So anyway, here's a mobile and curl springs. Hello. Oh cool me. Oh, yes, sir. We did a double header

[00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.560]
He gets to we went. Oh, God. Yes. We went to the mallins and the panthers great good for you

[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.600]
Here's a here's a local athletic supporter

[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.100]
Well, let's talk about the mallins game for a second. First of all the people have no clue at all

[00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:16.480]
Listen to this you can't first of all they only had one gate open to let you in oh nice. Why was that the escalated don't work?

[00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.580]
It's broken I

[00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:23.220]
Think if they can just cover up another 20,000 seats though or 30,000 seats with some schmathas

[00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.720]
I think it's gonna look sold out every game this year though

[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.540]
Uncle me. They said it was a sellout dude. You could roll the

[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.940]
Yeah, there was a lot I saw it on TV. There was a lot of empty seats. Yeah, so then check this out

[00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:39.180]
You catch a foul brawl nail to give you a bag of charcoal. Oh

[00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:46.780]
Yeah, that's to grill a cat with of course. So we left there at about 620 and we went over to the panthers

[00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.000]
That's where your real fans are

[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.920]
Uh-huh, nobody gets up in between parties

[00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.660]
The more people the get tested and then watching the game. Yeah

[00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:03.580]
The game was awesome the second pair was outrageous. Strock is God right and Ray Shepard

[00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:07.300]
You know I started I started to say this earlier. I got sidetracked

[00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:08.180]
I sidetracked myself

[00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:13.480]
Can you imagine where we would be now if if if Brian Murray wouldn't have acquired Ray Shepard and Marty Strocker?

[00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:18.160]
Can you imagine where we would be right now? Oh my god, you know how about that fight?

[00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.800]
In the stands not you all that one too. I saw you watching it. I was across from me

[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.040]
But how about the the fight in in the second period when

[00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:33.180]
So you got punch pretty good. Oh god Daniels. Oh, you mean when Daniels beat the crap out of a Paul laws. Yeah

[00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:38.120]
Oh, yeah, Paul laws man. That was the quickest fight in history. That was like a 22nd knockout

[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:43.440]
Yeah, I gave the guy to 10 minutes right, yeah, but hockey. I mean, I've totally got into it this year

[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.960]
I went to my first game last year was that well that's where it's at

[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.960]
That's what it's all about. I'm trying to explain to these rednecks down here

[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.240]
Hockey's the greatest sport in the world and if they don't understand that man

[00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.520]
They don't know what life is all about. There's nothing even close. There's nothing even close to it

[00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.220]
Anybody that hasn't been you know something Neil it was more exciting

[00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:01.820]
to see

[00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:06.180]
Cleanball run out there than watch them all again

[00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:12.500]
By the way, don't you love seeing those lineman go out there like in civis and of course he had shorts on and a and this guy

[00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:17.820]
I mean with all due respect to the dolphins in any other place the lineman and football are such a bunch of slabs

[00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:19.660]
They're so out of shape. They look like

[00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:24.720]
Oh John McSherry on a bad day. Yeah, what happened if cleanbell flipped on the ice and he was out for the season

[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.100]
Yeah, and of course he probably would have cracked the damn ice too. That would have been the end of the game

[00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:35.500]
We love you Neil. We love hockey. Please keep a team here and the big Keshi Heshi your douchebag

[00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:35.920]
Okay

[00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:37.200]
See ya

[00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:42.240]
Open line of power god. We still have had nobody asked for free tickets yet. Thank God. Oh, let's milk this for all we can

[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.620]
Please I'm begging you we have an open line of power

[00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:47.300]
So what do you think to speak or not to speak that's the question

[00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:49.380]
I'm looking at the lineup, but I'm gonna tell you something

[00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:52.900]
Wayne if you really want to get those Julio's in there this year you're off to a bad start

[00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.140]
We used to have bonito we had uh

[00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:59.700]
Who else did we have who is that right fielded and uh what tell us his name

[00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:01.220]
Hunir

[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.220]
Hunir Felix get the honey Hunir

[00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:08.300]
He sucked, but anyway, so I'm looking at our opening day lineup yesterday

[00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:13.360]
We got Kilvio Various leading off at second base. That's good. That's a real good Julio name Kilvio baby

[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:17.520]
We love you and then you got a you got Devon white. He's as black as the day is long

[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:22.900]
You got the Gary Sheffield looks pretty dark to me. You got Jeff Konaan who's very pasty and white in a great player

[00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:26.840]
You got Terry Pendlin who looks pretty dark to me last time I checked him out

[00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:30.920]
You got Colburner at first base. He looks awfully white and light-complexed to me

[00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:35.340]
You got Charles Johnson CJ behind her plate who looks fairly dark

[00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:41.300]
Complex it last time I checked no speaking of spawning you got Kurt Abbott who's kind of like a like a redneck

[00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:45.680]
He's a good guy shortstop. You got Kevin Brown. I thought pitch pretty damn good yesterday

[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:49.180]
He was a starter yesterday for those who don't care about baseball which I don't at the moment

[00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:50.980]
But I thought he pitched pretty damn good

[00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:55.500]
In fact, he did pitch pretty well seven things six hits and only one run and then of course

[00:06:55.500 --> 00:07:00.760]
New Yorkis Perez came in here who's the other Julio in the lineup and basically there went the game with three more runs which

[00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:04.400]
You know but Brown gets the loss because we never scored any

[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:08.620]
But anyway, so New Yorkis Perez who was the first relief pitcher

[00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:14.420]
And stunk that you went out and then Matthew's orcelac and whether's none of whom sounds too Hispanic to me

[00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:16.720]
So we only had two sticks in the whole lineup yesterday

[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:18.600]
Which is virus and Yorkis Perez

[00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:24.080]
That's no way to win over the Julio's just because you got a bunch of Julio talk there in the in the program

[00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:29.200]
That's not gonna do it. We need who in your Felix back. We need Benito San Diego. They used to love saying Benito

[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:31.600]
Benito your Benito. Benito you know, they loved it

[00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:37.340]
We need to have a hell of a whole bunch of Julios out there if you're really gonna win these guys over okay

[00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:42.540]
Take it from me. I know how to do it trust me okay. Let me say in fact. We'll get about your real good looking young Julios in there

[00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:42.800]
Okay

[00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:46.500]
We'll get some real good guys they may not be able to play too good, but they'll look good

[00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:49.680]
They'll get everybody out there to be screaming. They'll be moist. They'll be emotional

[00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:53.820]
Then we'll have like a real you know like yesterday they had about 40,000 people out there. That's okay

[00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:56.820]
And like I said wait we can just get some real big tarps and like

[00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:01.820]
You know if we can cover up 90% of the seats and make the seating capacity seven or eight thousand

[00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:04.620]
We can sell out every game this year which I think it'd be a record

[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:07.280]
12

[00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:10.080]
1213 at W I O D

[00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:12.340]
Guess who else was at the game last night

[00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:18.140]
Mike from a Atlantic Coast mortgage. That's right good guys over there. See these are just regular guys their hockey fans

[00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:21.860]
That's another reason I like him not only they treat our people well, which includes you

[00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:26.660]
But there's a guy that's a hockey fan. He comes to all the games. He stops by. He says hi

[00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:30.540]
What a great game this was after the second period when it was a great game and

[00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:34.600]
You know these are the kind of people you want to do business with just regular joes like for

[00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:37.400]
Off the street who want to help you get some money a

[00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:41.880]
Atlantic Coast mortgage a licensed mortgage business has been helping folks just like you ordinary folks

[00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:48.100]
Since 1982 you don't have to worry about that condescending attitude that those big hot shots with the three pea suits in a bank

[00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:51.120]
Have all you got to do is pick up the phone and make a phone call

[00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:55.900]
That's it that's all the effort you'll have to put out because they'll make an appointment when it's convenient for you

[00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:59.640]
They'll come to your home. They'll come to your orifice. They'll map out a mortgage plan just for you

[00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:02.340]
And even if you got some problems like maybe yourself employed

[00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:04.520]
Maybe you've had credit problems income problems

[00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:08.860]
They can still probably help you get the money and get the right mortgage just for your situation

[00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:14.120]
And you'll never ever I want to emphasize this ever pay an application fee no ripoffs

[00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:19.040]
So you'll never have to risk a dime if they can't get you the money you're looking for it won't cost you a penny to find out

[00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:25.260]

Sometimes we even spare them to the head with a washty water

[00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:42.240]
So they just had the Michael Irvings through their own channel six new don't you think you should get special dispensation because he went to you?

[00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:42.820]
I

[00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:49.220]
Have like up to six pounds of crack up to a six pound crack

[00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:57.120]
Why not your love to rape and you ought to be able to rape at least 17 co-eds and then like maybe five or 10 chicks off campus

[00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:02.720]
and 20 or 30 pounds of grass and 40 or 50 pounds of blow and

[00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:04.480]
80 or 50

[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:08.340]
Thousand pounds of fish as in blowfish and that's it

[00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:14.160]
What about the hookers? Oh no hookers. Oh, yeah hookers. So that's right. I forgot that. Okay 20 years

[00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:18.760]
See that's okay. They don't mind the drugs. It's just a sex they get very uptight about in America

[00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:24.180]
So you can do all the crack and all the blow you want as in blow this but hey, uh, no well see if you well

[00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:29.240]
Okay, let's go to it all depends on where you're blowing and what you're blowing. That's the problem

[00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:31.020]
That's what America's uptight about. Okay

[00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:36.760]
Here's Miami. Hello. Yeah, yeah, sir. You're gonna tell Michael. He can't carry his oozees too

[00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:37.680]
Oh no

[00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:44.320]
No, I was just gonna thank you. He can drive in his oozee though. Yeah, I don't know about that

[00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:48.260]
I was gonna thank you for turning me on the hockey this year. Yes, sir

[00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:50.600]
Been going to the games. I'm having a great time

[00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:54.820]
It's a good thing you got to find it this year because of course this could be our last which is a very ugly thought

[00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:59.200]
But it's something that's certainly in the back of my mind. Yeah, well, I'll drive to Broward if I have to

[00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:03.960]
No, I'm talking about our last in South Florida. I'm not talking about our last in the oh, I hope not

[00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:07.800]
I don't know and then I just got my name on the list for the season tickets right

[00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:14.420]
Open that they stay down here. They better. I agree and H. Wayne better watch it or otherwise

[00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:17.920]
He's gonna have to change the name of his team to the gringo set in the Marlins

[00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:21.600]
Yeah, and have a nice day

[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:29.480]
We have an open line at day 7519 463 751 W. I. D. So like I said that York is Perez came in there and this

[00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:31.320]
Could just stuck that joint out but anyway

[00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:37.000]
Where we going we're going to Lake Worth. Hello. Hey Neil. How are you? Okay first time caller?

[00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:42.680]
Oom motivated. I used to live in Miami and one thing I haven't heard brought up yet

[00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:47.560]
I used to live in the Kendall area. Well South Kendall. So did I I used to live in Kendall

[00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:52.120]
Yeah, okay five years. I lived in Kendall. Oh, I lived there from 1984. It was okay

[00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:57.140]
And I've been listening to you. It was congested. It would begin crime infested a lot of people there

[00:13:57.140 --> 00:13:59.260]
And it used to take me about an hour

[00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:05.160]
To get downtown because you had to take the pal meadow to a 36 the too long as parking lots in the world

[00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:11.640]
Yeah, it would be just as quick and easier to hop on the turnpike to go up to that sunrise location

[00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:14.040]
That's right. That's what I went on everybody but they don't yeah

[00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:18.400]
They're sticking it to the people who live in Miami as well except for the six fans who live on Miami Beach

[00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:21.080]
I mean the closest population area to the

[00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:26.480]
What what what fans who live on a beach what fans are there on a beach? Well, I said there were about six of them

[00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:30.160]
Yeah, you know on Miami Beach maybe and by that time and night most of them are so stone

[00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:33.460]
They can't make it across the river across the uh, whatever it is anyway the bay

[00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:35.620]
So it has nothing to do with even browered upon the

[00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:39.740]
Yeah, it has to do with Dave County to where's most of the population in Dave County?

[00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:40.520]
It's in the southwest

[00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:44.140]
At least the people that seem to want to go to the games. Yeah

[00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:49.800]
So why why drive through all that hectic? That's where all the Jews are in west Kendall last time I checked

[00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:54.500]
They speak English shows you're hockey fan. Yeah, and you got one up here in Lake Worth and basketball fans

[00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:59.120]
I don't know what I'm doing in Lake Worth and basketball fans too. Don't forget that and basketball fans too

[00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:04.100]
And I think that Mickey Mouse is making a very big mistake. I mean, I really do for

[00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:09.620]
You don't understand. It's part of that whole master plan. They got for that big gigantic port project there

[00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:11.360]
I must read they read doing the whole

[00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:14.760]
Bay there for Mickey Erison's fun and profit. That's what it's all about

[00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:18.320]
As if the billions of dollars that he's got already is not enough for him

[00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:20.740]
I'm sure they have a lot of work. How much does he need?

[00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:25.780]
It's not bad enough how much Wayne needs how much does the Erison family need before they got enough

[00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:29.280]
We'd like to know how much do they have to choke off this town

[00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:32.660]
And if anybody wonders how come we'll never get casino gambling here

[00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:38.540]
All they got to do is look how useful those cruises to nowhere are and those gambling ships if we had casino gambling in

[00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:41.040]
Casinos. Yeah, it got for bit got for bit

[00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:44.120]
This was definitely not a fan decision. There's no question about it

[00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:46.600]
Yeah, do it business quite a bit. It has to do with greed

[00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:51.880]
That's the only thing it's got to do with his greed and self-interest crap. There's no question about it

[00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:55.520]
I would love a pair of those tickets by the way if I possibly could okay

[00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:04.140]
Well if you're Jewish you got a pair you got okay hang on a big pair okay line a take care of our buddy there take care of our Jewish pizan

[00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:07.980]
We're not giving out tickets to know goiim. I'll tell you that right now

[00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:13.000]
So even if you're not Jewish you better lie about it and start speaking several words in Yiddish and or Hebrew or you're out

[00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:18.560]
Hey, listen, why the hell can't we start pulling this crap? Let's start putting the damn stuff in Yiddish in the program

[00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:23.880]
How would they like that? Huh as in hey coxah hois that would be good right there on the front page

[00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:28.200]
Whoever the hell of marlins are playing today. We got a message for you coxah hois. That's it

[00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:30.960]
Think they got the message or what

[00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:37.100]
So anyway pretty depressing about that john McShurie business and of course I continue trying to

[00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:39.500]
Emphasize to you that fat is not where it's at

[00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:42.660]
There are a lot of people who just don't want to get the message. They want to just keep you know

[00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:49.020]
Porn that stuff in there pouring it in shoveling it in like this is the way it's supposed to be let me ask you this much how in in nature

[00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:58.560]
How many animals do you see in nature who are fat you ever stop and think about that? I'm talking about I'm not talking about your pets that you're feeding the same crap that you're reading

[00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:03.460]
That you're killing by the way. I'm certainly not talking about that. I'm talking about like in the vile

[00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:07.760]
How many animals do you see that are fat

[00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:11.280]
I'll tell you oh the big oh none

[00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:13.780]
There are no fat animals in the wild

[00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:22.320]
Because they eat whatever they want to eat and then they run around and do whatever they're doing do whoever they're doing or whatever

[00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:24.640]
They're doing that so they might their own business. That's it

[00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:31.060]
I rest my goddamn case okay. Are you getting the message now or what oh boy? Look at that the weather sure looking

[00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:34.880]
I have a lot better toward the weekend. I'll tell you that wow wow wow oh

[00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:36.160]
Oh man

[00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:39.300]
Let's all hop on a plane and get out of this joint

[00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:44.360]
Here's for Lauderdale on the purple line. Hello. Hey Neil. Yes, sir

[00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:46.380]
Happy poem and back to you

[00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:51.200]
Mots the ball and all that good stuff. Uh-huh listen. Let's be a good George

[00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:58.040]
I went to my first game last night. Yeah, it was pretty cool. I liked it. Yeah, it was unbelievable

[00:17:58.460 --> 00:18:03.440]
Listen, uh, it was got through real early and we were checking out it was uh, you know, because I had I could say I'd never been there before

[00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:10.540]
Let's check them out warming up and I'm sitting there and these little bastards are running around chasing this stupid blimp

[00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:12.680]
Mm-hmm. What the hell is that all about?

[00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:16.300]
They need a lesson that they'll never forget you know

[00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:21.280]
Good and broken leg

[00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:26.540]
Oh, and by the way, I wonder what happened to the guy that got hit in the head with a puck that happened like

[00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:29.800]
That was right behind you wasn't it? That was right in front of me about four rows in the front of me

[00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:31.140]
I saw him grab his face

[00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:37.960]
Yeah, and then the kids his kids started screaming and crying at little kids there and uh, and then the white furry commonly

[00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:39.080]
I'll grab this jacket

[00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:45.660]
She walked out with very commonly like hey, I hope his skull is cracked open might not some sense in when we're something like that

[00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:49.660]
But the kids were like psychotic. I mean, he just got hit in the head with a puck, you know, I mean

[00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:53.820]
I was like both sound mom I was I've never been so it's kind of lost

[00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:58.520]
But I wasn't I was I was doing okay and it was one of those things where I saw it coming and of course

[00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:01.780]
I'm not a pussy when it comes to stuff like that. Okay, in fact

[00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:07.840]
I remember once I was broadcasting you of him baseball and caught a ball that came into the press box right between my knees

[00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:13.500]
It came up over the top of the encounter that we were working on and I caught it right between my knees

[00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:17.080]
That's called self preservation. That's what was what I would do on channel 33 with Bob Greacy

[00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:21.020]
And I caught it and believe me it never moved a half an inch

[00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:25.620]
I caught it there firmly between my knees because if it would have continued moving along

[00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:28.140]
It would my voice would be a lot higher now

[00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:29.760]
No, it is not

[00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:35.300]
But I only have one ball now. I see I didn't know the players and all that so I'm kind of like watch

[00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:40.080]
I mean, I know my name, but I don't know their numbers and who they are watching and I seen him make that shot

[00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:44.460]
And I guess it went off the other guy sticking it went airborne. Yeah, I'm trying to follow him

[00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:47.900]
He just said stick, you know to say he's trying to throw some more yiddish in there. He just said stick

[00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:49.280]
and but

[00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:53.780]
Them kids chasing that that blimp was driving me crazy and that stupid

[00:19:54.400 --> 00:20:00.900]
Launch in the t-shirts man these people are like animals. I know a freaking people like carrying on for free stuff man

[00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:06.100]
Doesn't it make you want a bar for people that are like a bunch of free loaders like that if they're gonna ask for something for your good

[00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:08.160]
Something free they should ask Neil for tickets, right?

[00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:09.240]
Right

[00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:18.200]
No, but I think it was pretty lame the only thing that I thought was like I said there's nothing more degrading and disgusting to me than people who gravel for free crap

[00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:23.300]
Neil the only thing that I thought was pretty cool with yeah, which was okay with the the things with the kids and the

[00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:25.780]
bumper things they were launching them

[00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:30.780]
During intermission on the ice. Oh, but I know you've seen that so many times

[00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:34.420]
You know if you never saw it, I guess you find that amusing. I don't know. It's both the I'm already man

[00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:38.740]
I've never seen snow or ice him as a first one I went in there, you know during a hockey game

[00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:40.280]
Well, you're easily amused I guess

[00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:44.820]
Yeah, kind of but my first intermission I went out to have a smoke for get it

[00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:50.020]
Oh, man, it was like a cocktail party out there, right people were on top of people

[00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:55.280]
Let me give you a piece of advice if you got to take a leak don't wait till in between periods to go there because you'll never happen

[00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:59.960]
Let's it on the floor. I didn't need to figure out that bad. I got back in I was like this is ridiculous. Yeah

[00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:02.260]
But yeah, can I check out a game?

[00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:09.260]
I beg your pardon can I go check out the game? Can I get some tickets to what the hockey game

[00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:11.200]

[00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:56.580]
You're a Walton Harry Carrey too

[00:22:57.220 --> 00:23:01.380]
As a matter of fact all the Chicago cups are Jewish

[00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:05.700]
Since I fell in love with you actor villain away

[00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:09.620]
I fell in love with you

[00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:11.300]
Beautiful

[00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:15.300]
So Ryan Sandberg's back Rhino is back. He's kind of embarrassed to come back

[00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:21.240]
But I guess he spent the other 40 million real fast and he needs a similar money or something or he's just getting bored or maybe he developed a personality

[00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:24.720]
Which I doubt Ryan Sandberg's back nice said Jewish boy not

[00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:29.600]
And it comes one yesterday I wonder if the not-slanding lady saw that she's probably pretty busy now

[00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:31.980]
It's tax time is she still doing that on the side or she

[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:34.700]
Just doing the air conditioning side

[00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:39.200]
Yeah, she works in the office for the air conditioning for the family

[00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:43.280]
I don't know so I think she does that she'd like moon lights or moonshines or whatever

[00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:47.580]
With the attack thing and she's definitely too busy to call us because it's like April 2

[00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:51.200]
So anyway moving along here's the North Miami. Hello

[00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:52.760]
Hey Anthony how you doing today?

[00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:59.100]
Okay, I got a question a couple questions for you real quick when they were planning the Miami arena about 10 years ago

[00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:02.660]
How come they didn't plan like all the new state of the art

[00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:08.560]
Modern age there are a bunch of schmucks. That's why why wouldn't they think about there a bunch of corocular little schmucks

[00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:09.440]
And that's just

[00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:14.300]
Because you're dealing with Miami politicians who know nothing about sky box from schlocks from

[00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:18.620]
Rocks they know nothing right? I can't understand Ryan Cox

[00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:22.940]
Yeah, my other quick question is you can have grapes on before the playoffs start

[00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:27.780]
Yeah, let's see that's a couple of weeks away. Yeah, I guess so we'll have them on a couple weeks

[00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:30.100]
You know that your best shows right there. Yeah

[00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:34.000]
And cuz I when I give them a little education as to what the hell's going on

[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.020]
He don't know what's going on. Hey when he says to the moon. That's the best. I love that

[00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:42.040]
Okay, it's like around for the tickets sure. I guess so thank you. How about okay hang on

[00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:46.600]
Line three take care of that guy on air now. Who's that is that the not slanting lady? Yes

[00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:51.200]
See, I knew she'd be on air immediately. I didn't want to embarrass you though. Well, you had to know I would call

[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:54.840]
Oh, I thought you'd be busy doing tax stuff. Well, I am busy doing tax stuff

[00:24:54.840 --> 00:25:00.240]
Now you're still doing that, but just like yes moonlighting right like I said I finally got one right that's good

[00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:05.500]
So how's your weight coming if I may ask such a personal question? It's doing wonderfully. Yeah, yes

[00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:10.320]
You've lost the number huh? Well, you don't have to give it to me. I don't know why you wouldn't want to give it

[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:15.740]
I don't want to know how much you weigh just how much you lost 102. Oh my god. Oh

[00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:16.800]
Wow

[00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:18.620]
Yeah, I'm a different person

[00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:26.380]
She's lost 102 pounds on the Atkins. How do you like that? Yes, I have and not because she read about it in new times either. That's right

[00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:31.880]
My good buddy Neil that amazing 102 pounds. I know it is

[00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:36.820]
It's completely amazing all these people come around to arena and you know the hockey games

[00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:43.680]
And one guy last night. I guess he said 44 and then there was another guy that's lost over a hundred and somebody with 25 and

[00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:51.080]
It's amazing. It is my kid's school all the people in the office on it now really yes, they must have read new times

[00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:53.360]
I don't think so. No

[00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:55.020]
How about that?

[00:25:55.640 --> 00:26:00.400]
I've started the quietest revolution in history and look at this. They're showing the John McShurie thing again

[00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:05.520]
Here what I thought one is wrong with you people on channel six. Will you stop doing this already?

[00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:10.480]
My god the man is dead. What a shame. Oh

[00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:13.640]
352 pounds soaking wet

[00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:18.860]
What a shame it's standing out there in the heat and one of the best umpires of all time too. He's a great guy

[00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:23.400]
I like John McShurie was good was but he was fat. Yes, he was see what that faddle do to you

[00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:28.180]
And now look at that now they follow that story up with mother Teresa. I think they're going from the sublime to the ridiculous

[00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:31.200]
Jesus. We don't have to go to that extreme

[00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:35.060]
Next I'll have Wendy Bennett on there. That's right. No

[00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:39.060]
But anyways, you lost 102. That's great. So you did you watch the game yesterday?

[00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:45.120]
The Cubs game. Yeah, no, I just read the box score and I had to go and see what Mark did of course

[00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:47.080]
I was watching the marlins and

[00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:51.680]
Mark races up at a basis look because I heard that the cubs went into extra innings in their games

[00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:56.280]
So I flipped over to GN on a satellite immediately and they were in the bottom of the tent

[00:26:56.280 --> 00:27:01.620]
I guess it was right bottom of the tent. So you got to see it bases are loaded with guests one out and

[00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:06.640]
Here's Mark raced up there and he follows off a couple of tough pitches and then slams it past their base and

[00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:12.600]
Harry screaming cubs win and that was it. It was great. Harry by the way sounds like oh does he really any breath?

[00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:15.780]
Well, I don't want to say that not after yes, it sounds really

[00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:20.680]
Hey, deal. Fuck you. Yeah, any breath could be the last round. So Rhino looked pretty

[00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:26.380]
I don't know. I didn't I just that's the other I turned it on just and I guess I was the one that put him over the top

[00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:31.240]
Because I turned it on just in time for him to get the winning hit you and my race and chess scored the winning run

[00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:36.000]
And evidently he had tied it up in the ninth with a two run homer right? So how do you like that? That's wonderful

[00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:40.280]
But I can't I don't care about the cubs. I know you're still you got to go with me

[00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:42.060]
You got to get me good seats for one of those games

[00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:44.300]
Okay, and we'll go together

[00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:49.680]
Maybe I'll get you good tickets. I'll get your seats believe me. We got plenty of seats

[00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:52.480]
Well, great. We were given away seats yesterday for opening day

[00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:56.200]
That should tell you how much interest there is in this joint for the mollons. Yes

[00:27:56.700 --> 00:28:01.200]
It's a shame. I still got to find out who that kid was sitting in our seats at the hockey game last night

[00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:06.220]
With his girlfriend maybe he'll be very good. Huh? Maybe he'll be he was there once before

[00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:09.280]
So he must be related to somebody that works here or somebody

[00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:13.860]
That's sweet as she had blonde. Here. He looked the head that's sweet as she looked like a good looking match

[00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:16.440]
Sundine is a matter of fact. She didn't tell me those things

[00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:18.920]
Yeah, my weaknesses you would have been hyper ventilating

[00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:24.660]
You would have forgotten all about holy holy grace. I don't know this year mark grace and I have to have like a little

[00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:30.140]
Meeting oh, yeah, now that you've now that you're shapely and uh, yeah

[00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:32.780]
You have to hold a meat

[00:28:33.460 --> 00:28:38.580]
Yes, I'm like that. Okay. Take care. Well, thanks for calling in the stay busy. I will bye. Bye

[00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:41.400]
Not slanting lady there checking in as soon as she heard mark grace

[00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:43.360]
She dropped all those tax forms right on the floor

[00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:47.860]
So what if somebody does go to jail for who cares? She says it's a question of priorities. What's more important?

[00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:49.060]
And obviously it's mark grace

[00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:54.740]
So did we find out yet who that kid was at the game last night or not had to be unless now they weren't sitting in

[00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:58.520]
Because they've sat in there once before they must be related to somebody that's here now

[00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:00.640]
Didn't you once tell me that somebody downstairs?

[00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:02.840]
Was it isia

[00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:07.340]
He had a plantation high school ring on so it's somebody who lives in plantation

[00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:10.700]
Do we have anybody works here that lives in plantation?

[00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:14.100]
It's got a son of a good that did go because he's definitely not in high school no more

[00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:15.740]
Thank god because that's a problem

[00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:17.680]
But a lot of people we do

[00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:21.080]
Besides me that lives in plantation oh

[00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:23.500]
Jeans binato that's right Johnny dark

[00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:27.980]
Jeans binato. Oh, yeah, it must be related to Johnny dark. He had that blonde hair just like Johnny

[00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:29.520]
Ha ha ha

[00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:33.860]
Yeah, he kind of reminded me of Johnny dark, huh? Yeah

[00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:40.000]
Here's a lady in for Lauderdale. Hello. Hey. How you doing? Okay. Oh there last night. Where yeah great

[00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:41.840]

I gave you a couple of Danemons right

[00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:50.060]
Right. Yeah, we were there again last night and uh, where the hell did he get those by the way?

[00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:55.040]
Um, there's a tobacco shop and a pember pine. Oh, we don't want to promote them because Mike's a garter get all psychony

[00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:56.640]
Okay, so I don't know where it is then

[00:29:56.640 --> 00:30:01.420]
Okay, but got him there and um, it was a better crowd than but yeah

[00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:06.040]
I was I was very pleased which I'm usually pretty skeptical and they got there a little bit on the late side

[00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:09.980]
Which I didn't understand because of the baseball game, but uh 13,000 plus for heartbirds

[00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:13.660]
Even without anything else going on. That's a damn good crowd. Yeah, pretty good

[00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:19.260]
Yeah, I like to say that the screw blend makes me reclumped every time he touches. Oh man

[00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:24.560]
What are we gonna do about him? He maybe we'll just make him miss the bus and not go on his road trip

[00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:32.060]
I hope so he's pathetic. I mean we got basically we're hanging on for dear life and 15.3 seconds left in the game

[00:30:32.060 --> 00:30:38.220]
And he gets another stupid penalty and he gives it up every time. Oh, he just uh he gives me the willies big time

[00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:43.220]
And uh, he's just scary and I just want to say I love the show and I am sucking up for Tampa

[00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:47.440]
I've got we've gone to a bunch of games and I'd like to get it at once. Okay, you will

Who's that boy? Oh, you can say hi to Mike and thanks for this cigar's mic

[00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:54.740]
Okay, and hang on

That's hey, that's what it takes you know

[00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:03.440]
It's tit for tat baby you rub it a little out rub it a little we'll see what happens

[00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:08.620]
It's grease in somebody's palm. That's what the whole world is built on that kind of stuff. Okay

[00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:11.700]
If you're gonna be a freeloader then you're never gonna get nothing

[00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:14.440]
If you're gonna like tip the guy at valet parking a couple of extra bucks

[00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:17.700]
You'll bet your car will be right out there and I'll say yes sir mr. Niel

[00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:21.980]
Here's your car and I have a big smile on his face to say oh by the way don't let anybody back into you again

[00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:26.560]
Because Tony the nose is getting a little upset about you know that insurance

[00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:31.160]
So anyway wonder if Tony the nose is gonna have the concession at the brand new arena in brown

[00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:36.060]
If we get it built so I get the feeling we're not gonna hear anything today is that what we're gonna go through this again

[00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:41.720]
Day after day after day after day we're gonna be spending hours at the bull

[00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:49.480]
Not the orange bull, but at the porcelain bull we're gonna be spending hours with baited breath on hands and knees

[00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:54.540]
Waiting to find out if we're gonna get screwed over if we're gonna get our beautiful new arena where it belongs right there in

[00:31:54.540 --> 00:31:58.920]
Somewhere in Broward or if it's just you know how long can this drag on you know what I'm saying?

[00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:01.240]
How long can you drag it before it starts bleeding

[00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:07.660]
1241 at wiod tropical Chevrolet they're not bleeding over there

[00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:12.720]
But they do have a little mess on their hands. It's that construction business which still goes on just like the construction on

[00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:16.180]
Viscane Boulevard which seems to be going on for last 500 years

[00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:22.800]
Man if they do plan to building that whole thing down there at bison teniole park if they do that as fast as they're repaving by a

[00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:27.480]
Miss game Boulevard by the year 2459 by the year 2525

But anyway

[00:32:32.220 --> 00:32:33.120]
It's a mess

[00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:39.920]
Basketball and hockey are winding down. So it's time to talk dolphin football

[00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:45.120]

[00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:02.920]
Here's Lauder Hill hello

[00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:06.060]
I'm in bokeh now like I said here's bokeh

[00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:07.840]
I got a

[00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:11.620]
First of all my people would say that's a big improvement by the way

[00:34:11.620 --> 00:34:15.880]
I want to knock the people in Lauder Hill but quite frankly got a pretty marginal town, but anyway it is

[00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:21.580]
The my vote is no for the for the espagnol in the in the marlin's

[00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:25.040]
Manual there. Yeah, I just don't think that's right

[00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:32.360]
Um, I had a question about this whole thing that's going on with your arena yesterday. No article. Yeah in the paper about the lady

[00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:37.380]
One of the ladies on the commission who says she's sick and tired appearing about it. She's voting no regardless

[00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:43.960]
Well, how can somebody on a commission who's supposed to vote on the details just come out at a pure emotion

[00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:47.680]
She just says she just don't give a crap about it. That's all that's at lory whatever her name is

[00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:52.000]
She just don't give a flying crap about it. Well then she shouldn't be on a commission. Right. That's right. That's unbelievable

[00:34:53.180 --> 00:35:01.200]
Amen, but uh listen nil I uh will be out of town for the ranger game. Yeah, and I would love to be at possibly the last game of the franchise history

[00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:07.840]
Last game in franchise history. That's a little bit um you said before it may be out of here

[00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:11.920]
And I don't want to miss the last game. Well the last game then would be the ranger game. I can't help you

[00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:16.480]
I'm saying game is sold out and I don't have any free tickets for it. I think you may have a problem there

[00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:17.840]
Well, can I go to Tampa Bay?

[00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:22.960]
Please there's a plane leaving at about 3 30 on uh us air, I think

[00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:26.400]
Please you mean you want to go to the lightning game? Is that what you try to say?

[00:35:26.540 --> 00:35:29.200]
Please guys because you're doing a very very uh weak job

[00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:31.580]
You have to be a little more assertive say give me the goddamn tickets

[00:35:31.580 --> 00:35:33.600]
Give me the goddamn ticket. What kind of an attitude is that?

[00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:37.980]
Hang on all right line seven take care of that poor wimp. Well yeah, Jesus

[00:35:38.540 --> 00:35:40.040]
Quit acting like such a wimp

[00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:46.120]
Now where's the thing I was looking at in this stupid article here brown arena could hinge largely on this and that and uh

[00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:51.200]
We're I'm so sick and tired of this crap manager's uh Laurie parish. There you go

[00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:57.580]
Laurie parish. She's the one that evidently corny our spy report about 1130 that call we had from Saudi was at the meeting

[00:35:57.580 --> 00:36:01.480]
She was the one who was also saying well, let's uh, you know when in doubt. Let's drag it out

[00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:07.360]
I don't spend two hundred twelve million dollars without reviewing it and studying it said county commissioner Laurie parish

[00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:09.760]
I think it's irresponsible to vote on it today

[00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:12.620]
What does it hurt to postpone it for a week? It might be fine

[00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:16.140]
But I don't know that because I haven't read it well read it bitch

[00:36:16.540 --> 00:36:18.940]
Read it and vip and get with it

[00:36:21.020 --> 00:36:24.100]
God they got a guy coming in here. Oh musta like uh, I don't know

[00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:25.700]
Maybe his stocks all went up for something

[00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:28.040]
Maybe he woke up on the right side of bed one day

[00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:29.720]
But he wants to like a guarantee

[00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:34.840]
Uh underwrite any and all losses for the arena. They can't possibly lose any money

[00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:41.960]
They bringing that goddamn Gary Bettman the top man the head cheese the big Hanjo the big Kahuna as we say here at i.o.d

[00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:47.200]
And uh, and they still like our dillin around over there

[00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:52.120]
Unlike in date county where they like oh yeah, okay, whatever you say here it is

[00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:55.820]
We just found it under a goddamn mattress somewhere here's 165 million

[00:36:55.820 --> 00:36:59.340]
Which has turned in it over 200 million, but hey, we'll put in a bank and make it grow

[00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:07.540]
They're just dillin around over there the dragon their feet it almost looks it looks to me like they're almost looking for an excuse

[00:37:07.540 --> 00:37:13.240]
As if to say well, I don't think so they probably went out and took a survey in cemetery village of all the old farts

[00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:17.480]
And they said we don't need no arena here. How about if we have an early bird there, huh?

[00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:22.100]
We could have the only arena in america with a concession stand with an early bird concession

[00:37:22.100 --> 00:37:26.260]
The game don't start till 7 30, but they open the gates at 3 30

[00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:31.520]
Okay, so you can eat your early bird at 4 we can have a morisons cafeteria line right inside

[00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:34.680]
We can have a satis buffet right inside the arena

[00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:37.980]
Go over better than halivan sunrise. Oh

[00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:43.000]
Here's wilton manners. Hello. Hi, do you know how you doing? Okay. Good

[00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:45.120]
Um, what's that for you? Yes

[00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:51.400]
How many times am I going to see this ref hit the turf on the TV? I know it's ridiculous

[00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:53.980]
Isn't incredible. You mean the umpire yeah, the umpire

[00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:57.800]
We don't have referees. Well, the umpires. Yeah, three times this morning

[00:37:57.800 --> 00:38:00.520]
They just keep showing it over and over and over again

[00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:03.540]
And I think Dave hides got a good point but nobody read his column this morning

[00:38:03.540 --> 00:38:06.700]
They would stop showing this of course because they're just a bunch of grave robbers

[00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:12.320]
And like I said, that's all the public in this country wants to see is just a bunch of grotesque violent stuff and snuff films

[00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:14.460]
That's all they want yeah, it just seems like it's pretty good

[00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:20.780]
What happens the the media just drags it on and on and on for weeks just not the snuffs enough

[00:38:21.540 --> 00:38:24.460]
Okay, first time caller. Yeah, and

[00:38:24.460 --> 00:38:28.880]
I started listening to you right about when the act and you started talking about acting. Yeah

[00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:30.660]
25 pounds great

[00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:35.540]
Not too bad. I went off of it gained a few back. That's okay. But I'm right back on it

[00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:39.440]
Yeah, I'm gonna come that's something video hop off it for a little while and you hop right back on it

[00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:41.840]
Yeah, that's what they said no problem. Right. That's great

[00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:46.520]
Um, also I went to my first panther game last night right which was great

[00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:51.640]
You weren't sitting behind me were you? No sir. Oh, thank god because the phone you'd hear a dial tone so fast

[00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:58.040]
No, these two guys man they were huckin a china the whole night about a bunch of kaka and they were talking loud like

[00:38:58.040 --> 00:39:01.720]
Like you and I are talking right now and they're sitting right behind us, okay?

[00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:05.560]
That's incredible all crap that had nothing to do whatsoever with the game

[00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:07.380]
That's unbelievable. They should have been out stood

[00:39:08.180 --> 00:39:11.460]
But we really enjoyed it. Yeah, the fans seem pretty supportive

[00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:17.080]
Yeah, and uh, we had a great time. I was a good night last night except for the damn fistfight in the stands

[00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:20.080]
They're right at the end. That was a deplorable. Oh, we were disgusting

[00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:22.800]
They were probably trying to put a show on for Wayne

[00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:28.160]
But we really enjoyed it and I was wondering if I could maybe snore for a pair of tickets

[00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:32.540]
You were wondering if you could go again. I'll like on the week a week from tomorrow on the tent again

[00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:36.840]
The Tampa Bay Lightning that we better beat that night and cut the crap. Yeah, absolutely. Okay

[00:39:40.540 --> 00:39:41.260]
Thank you

[00:39:41.260 --> 00:39:46.580]
This Jeff Moss with these damn tickets. We had a real show going here for while and now we got these freeloading people on here

[00:39:46.580 --> 00:39:50.220]
They got basically nothing to say which is good because it's killing some good time

[00:39:51.820 --> 00:39:55.500]
Oh, God, do I wish we'd had Wayne Arnold come down here with some food today, you know

[00:39:56.020 --> 00:40:00.240]
Because I got to hang around and up up there, you know this afternoon for all oh

[00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:04.780]
We should have Wayne Arnold come in here with something. How the hell am I gonna make it all day without anything?

[00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:07.480]
The least they could do is cater like a little something over here

[00:40:08.220 --> 00:40:13.700]
Then I'm gonna have to sit around with her hot shots over there and listen to a bunch of bull crap. What kind of garbage is that?

[00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:21.180]
Stealing minutes from my precious life see that's what I don't like is when people steal even one minute from your life at that point

[00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:23.120]
They ought to go right to jail do not pass go

[00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:27.960]
They're stealing your precious time and as we saw yesterday with John McShurie rest in peace

[00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:32.180]
We never know just how much time we got left when we weigh 352 pounds

[00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:36.900]
Here's Miami hello. Yeah, sir. How you doing? Okay

[00:40:36.900 --> 00:40:43.700]
Speaking of Wayne Arnold I'm right across the street right now. Yeah, bring something over. Yeah, George says bring something by

[00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:45.920]
I'll call Murray. What do you want?

[00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:50.920]
You're at 125th and 441. Yeah, the public throwing on the cross street. Huh?

[00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:54.580]
For an hour here waiting. Well, how fast can you get down here?

[00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:56.920]
George can call Murray right now

[00:40:57.820 --> 00:41:02.260]
About 2015 20 minutes, I guess and what are we gonna do give you tickets and exchange for it?

[00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:06.600]
Well, I'm the guy who gave you the Toronto Maple Leaf clock. Oh, yeah

[00:41:07.380 --> 00:41:11.800]
That's right you gave me something already so you don't have to bring the food down here. I'll bring it anyway

[00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:12.680]
That's good

[00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:17.260]
So you want to go to the game right? Yeah, that's a deal. Okay, hang on and Georgia

[00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:23.080]
Arrange the whole thing. All right. He's masterful with that hang on. Okay, line two take care of that guy and calm him down

[00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:26.260]
So we don't hang up and then tell Murray want a whole bunch of stuff. We want it down here by 130

[00:41:27.100 --> 00:41:31.560]
Because I'm not gonna starve here all day because we got a bunch of hot shots in here with the Cox corporate

[00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:32.800]
Bull crap going on

[00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:39.760]
It never ends here, man. It just never ever ever ends talk about neurotic repetition. Oh, Jesus

[00:41:41.660 --> 00:41:47.580]
Here's a plantation. Hello. Yeah, Neil. Yes, sir. When they planted on building the arena out near the sawgrass

[00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:55.220]
The Broward one a bigger part of the arena was a planned on being built near the sawgrass possibly

[00:41:55.880 --> 00:42:00.760]
Oh, did you just come out of a coma or something? I want to make sure before I stayed in the next statement

[00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:07.860]
Possibly there possibly a Broward at 9.95 possibly adjacent to pop it apart. Those are the three sites that they've been debating about

[00:42:07.860 --> 00:42:13.820]
Think the sawgrass I think was number one. Yeah, and it's Wayne's Lori Hyzing the works for Preston Han

[00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:21.960]
And the swap shop. Yeah, so anything that's going to bring people to the sawgrass is going to hurt her directly

[00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:27.820]
So well then why do you think she snows

[00:42:28.740 --> 00:42:33.060]
Snowball on this thing. Stonewall on this thing. Who's who's the snowball?

[00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:41.160]
What does Lori parish have to do with it? Is she not the commissioner that's stonewalling the boat? No, she's not the one

[00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:46.180]
She's got nothing to do with the site. She isn't she doesn't want to you don't understand what I'm saying

[00:42:46.180 --> 00:42:53.520]
Like the most people want it. No, let me say it again. That's the site that the panthers want all right

[00:42:53.520 --> 00:43:02.060]
Who owns the panthers? Wayne right. So where's the logic and what you just got to tell him again? She works for Preston who does?

[00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:08.960]
Oh Lori parish works for Preston Han. There you go. What the hell is she got to do with Preston Han?

[00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:14.600]
She works for she works at the swap shop. She worked the Broward Commissioner works at the swap shop. Yeah

[00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:23.080]
One to two hour who said not your his new album duets is a smash it old blue eyes is still got it

[00:43:23.080 --> 00:43:29.940]
I'm keeping it baby. So now Frank Sinatra sings the 90. Yeah, what the heck I'm almost there anyway

[00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:32.740]
Frank Salutes the red hot chili pepper

[00:43:32.740 --> 00:43:44.200]
Give it away give it away give it away now or I'll freaking take it the chairman of the board sings right said Fred and spans the years while touching a whole new generation

[00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:50.600]
I'm too sexy for my hat too sexy for my hat even though I'm old and fat

[00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:56.100]
You won't want to miss Frank Sinatra's new sound that's as fresh as tag team

[00:43:56.100 --> 00:43:59.500]
Hey pops. I really dig those crazy thread locks

[00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:01.540]
won't there it is

[00:44:01.540 --> 00:44:03.780]
I said won't there it is

[00:44:03.780 --> 00:44:10.260]
You worked out wiki won't you Frank Sinatra sings the night is available now at record stores and nights of Columbus halls everywhere

[00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:13.040]
You can't touch this unless you buy it

[00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:18.820]
So anyway, it's 107 at W.I.D. We're sitting here on pins and needles. They're on a verge of voting and Brooks said it looks good

[00:44:18.820 --> 00:44:21.660]
How does she know that did she personally pull them? I mean so to speak

[00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:26.060]
She said it's gonna pass five to two it looks like now and we're sitting

[00:44:26.060 --> 00:44:29.280]
We're sitting like right on the edge waiting for like a big explosion to take place

[00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:33.760]
So we'll find out for you like any second. Okay, just keep it right here

[00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:37.860]
Just keep your finger on it and we'll we got our pulse. What do we got three pair of these to give away yet?

[00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:39.940]
We give away seven. I hope I'm counting right

[00:44:40.860 --> 00:44:45.440]
Because the last thing I want to do is give away tickets that we don't got and pull out of the one of these bogus contests

[00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:47.500]
We always do we got three left right

[00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:49.980]
George

[00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:55.400]
We got three pair left. Oh, I thought I thought I shook my head or not it up and down you

[00:44:55.400 --> 00:44:59.100]
Well, how can I see you when I'm slumping back here in the chair underneath this thing because there's a lot of

[00:44:59.100 --> 00:45:01.120]
There's a lot of pressure going right now

[00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:09.020]
We're waiting for the result of this vote. Don't you understand the future with this goddamn of our lives the gaze of our lives and if you believe that

[00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:13.980]
Here's a pompano. Hello. Hi. How you doing? Okay, listen

[00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:15.820]
I don't know if you heard the

[00:45:15.820 --> 00:45:18.560]
Report before but it's just another example of them

[00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:25.000]
White watching everything they gave a report about why the tourism was down in Miami. Yeah, South Florida

[00:45:25.580 --> 00:45:27.460]
And they blamed it on the weather up north

[00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:31.980]
It wouldn't have it happen to have anything to do with uh wait a minute

[00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:34.000]
What do you mean by that the weather up north has been a nightmare

[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:37.640]
It's been the worst winter in recent memory. They break in all the records for snow

[00:45:37.640 --> 00:45:41.740]
Why shouldn't the tourism be better than ever exactly? That's what I'm saying. What does that mean?

[00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:45.240]
They're telling us that the reason people didn't come down here was because they couldn't get out

[00:45:45.240 --> 00:45:54.100]
Right. Oh give me a break right on your way. Yeah, I break. Oh my god talking about the the city or the excuses never in

[00:45:54.100 --> 00:45:56.920]
Oh, they just keep coming up with better and bigger excuses

[00:45:56.920 --> 00:46:01.660]
Nothing to do with the crime down here. It has to do everything. Our image is pristine baby

[00:46:01.660 --> 00:46:05.460]
Everybody around the world when you when you tell me you're from Miami you work or live in Miami

[00:46:05.460 --> 00:46:09.580]
They look at you like I can't believe you're still alive. Oh my god. I mean all I know

[00:46:09.580 --> 00:46:13.000]
Just like the godfather. They hit him with five shots and he's still alive

[00:46:14.260 --> 00:46:17.200]
And also for old Panther fans including myself. Yes

[00:46:17.660 --> 00:46:19.280]
Sail Royal Caribbean instead

[00:46:19.820 --> 00:46:24.520]
There you go. There you go. Just say goodbye to carnival cruise lines. That's my suggestion. I will never

[00:46:24.520 --> 00:46:29.540]
I will never sell carnival cruise lines and I will never subscribe to Miami her old either

[00:46:29.540 --> 00:46:32.460]
The hero could start putting a hundred dollar bills inside of each edition

[00:46:32.460 --> 00:46:35.280]
I still wouldn't go out and buy it. I would just uh breaking to one of those damn

[00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:36.820]
Vending boxes exactly

[00:46:36.820 --> 00:46:41.600]
Listen, I'd like to suck around for a couple tickets. Okay, you got them. All right. Thanks. You'll see you there next Wednesday

[00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:45.520]
Okay, hang on purple. I take care of that guy. Okay. That's eight pair. We got two to go

[00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:47.420]
But who cares about free hockey tickets

[00:46:48.340 --> 00:46:52.620]
The one thing we finally got see I understand I'm a big hockey fan. It's selfish

[00:46:52.620 --> 00:46:57.380]
We wanted in sunrise of course right by my house and right where it's convenient for lots of us

[00:46:57.380 --> 00:46:59.540]
Meaning those of us who live like in centralbroward

[00:46:59.540 --> 00:47:03.580]
But the bottom line is when you live in a place for 20 years and there's such a

[00:47:03.580 --> 00:47:10.340]
Dirt of anything when it's such a dead what a hellhole when there's so many old disgusting decaying farts

[00:47:10.340 --> 00:47:15.060]
When there's so many illegal aliens driving around in their little brown Toyota's making life almost unlivable

[00:47:15.060 --> 00:47:19.720]
When there's nothing but crime and mayhem and murder and mud shit on the highway and all his crap

[00:47:20.220 --> 00:47:25.220]
And you finally get something that you can be positive about that people can sink their teeth into that's fun

[00:47:25.220 --> 00:47:27.180]
That's great. That's positive

[00:47:27.820 --> 00:47:31.980]
And you got to hang on for life and death because you're like on a verge of somebody taking it away

[00:47:31.980 --> 00:47:34.540]
And you know what it's consistent at least I'll give them that

[00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:40.280]
At least it's consistent with that philosophy if we don't want people here having too good of a time

[00:47:40.340 --> 00:47:42.900]
Because that's the mentality in this god damn state

[00:47:43.440 --> 00:47:46.360]
Come to Florida but god forbid you should have too good of a time

[00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:49.280]
And by the way, how do hell come stavros is still back on here?

[00:47:49.320 --> 00:47:50.680]
I thought he ran away with Marlena

[00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:55.700]
For this show they really need to suck kaitras for this god damn show the gaze of our lives man

[00:47:57.880 --> 00:47:59.860]
So anyway, I'm just I'm just

[00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:02.120]
I'm choking. I'm gagging

[00:48:02.860 --> 00:48:04.240]
I'm waiting for the good news

[00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:07.360]
They're getting ready to vote is that what she said like seven minutes ago

[00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:10.220]
She said that they're getting ready to vote they're like right on a verge of it

[00:48:10.700 --> 00:48:13.300]
Well, what are they doing what do they have a little four play first?

[00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:15.580]
Are they all in the floor having a little floor play

[00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:23.680]
Here's south Miami. Hello. Hi Neil. Yes, sir. How you doing great? Well, I've lost 32 pounds on that

[00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:30.120]
Doing great another guy that reads new times or height. Oh, I've never been to a hockey game

[00:48:30.120 --> 00:48:34.700]
Yeah, and I thought maybe we could suck a few tickets out of you. Okay, you can suck a pair

[00:48:34.700 --> 00:48:38.840]
Thanks of tickets hang on okay line three. That's the ninth pair

[00:48:38.840 --> 00:48:42.300]
Let's get this exercise over with so we can start talking to some people like I've got something to say

[00:48:42.300 --> 00:48:45.900]
That's my idea. That's my idea of a show not just sitting around giving away a bunch of stuff

[00:48:45.900 --> 00:48:51.020]
In fact, I even like better when Phil comes on here and a either doesn't give away at all or be gives them to people who don't exist

[00:48:51.020 --> 00:48:54.020]
That's the way to do it Phil that's the way to do it with this audience

[00:48:55.960 --> 00:49:00.960]
So anyway, it's the clock is ticking along and we're sitting here and there are a lot of very nervous people out there

[00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:06.740]
And I don't care what any fat slob gets on here and says on any radio station about how nobody really cares except a small handful of people

[00:49:06.740 --> 00:49:12.580]
It's a large handful of people out of you like that Hank of course. What would you know about a large handful probably about the same thing

[00:49:12.580 --> 00:49:14.660]
I would yeah nothing how about a small handful

[00:49:15.100 --> 00:49:17.380]
Yeah, we Jews can relate to that. That's what Andy said

[00:49:18.340 --> 00:49:22.320]
So anyway, we got one pair left. I think we ought to do a break here. Okay, make them wait in suspense

[00:49:22.320 --> 00:49:26.060]
And maybe when we come back from the break we'll have some word maybe the bird will be the word

[00:49:26.540 --> 00:49:29.140]
And we'll find out what the story is they're getting ready to vote and

[00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:34.340]
And uh not listen to we have a gun to each commissioner's head to make sure that this thing comes out the way we want

[00:49:34.340 --> 00:49:37.760]
That's the way to do it. Okay, make him an offer they can't refuse all right

[00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:42.280]
We got a man up there that's got more money than Jesus and almost as much money is uh Mickey

[00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:48.720]
But not nearly as much and this guy is willing to underwrite the losses and you mean to tell me the risotto brothers are willing to underwrite our losses

[00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:50.060]
And you don't want to take this deal

[00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:54.600]
Isn't that who it was? Who now were the risotto brothers

[00:49:55.580 --> 00:50:00.280]
They were not the ones that were for that was the what was the day goes on a west coast that were protecting uh Frado

[00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:02.360]
The

[00:50:02.360 --> 00:50:09.180]
The um was number son over the guy always get that wrong. I always out of brothers were the ones that were uh bankrolling the uh yeah

[00:50:09.700 --> 00:50:14.840]
What oh it was the mall and airy family on a west coast that's it the mall and airy family on a west coast

[00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:18.600]
Not only putting the put the hit on uh Frankie pentangely with uh

[00:50:18.600 --> 00:50:20.240]
Heim and Roths orders. Oh

[00:50:20.900 --> 00:50:25.660]
So what the hell is that guy to do with this? So in other words you better pass the damn thing or we're calling up the risotto brothers

[00:50:25.660 --> 00:50:26.540]
How do you like that?

[00:50:27.160 --> 00:50:28.760]
My friends with their propane gas

[00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:31.740]
So anyway, it's 113 at W.I.O.D

Is on the cold

[00:51:10.360 --> 00:51:13.240]
He got the spare tire in his middle

[00:51:13.960 --> 00:51:16.780]
He's always hauling the healthy load

[00:51:17.480 --> 00:51:23.900]
He had a blue plate special with three flat beans and you can hear his crack explode

[00:51:24.620 --> 00:51:26.660]

Is on the cold

[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:44.320]
The old man

[00:51:45.740 --> 00:51:47.240]
Is on the cold

[00:51:55.600 --> 00:51:57.680]

But evidently it looks like they are gonna vote on it. Is that is that what she said?

[00:52:24.140 --> 00:52:28.780]
Isn't that what she just said like 15 20 minutes ago our good friend our good close personal friend Brooke

She said they're getting ready to vote on it. Isn't that what she just said or did I dream that did I my hallucinating and hyper ventilating God damn it

You know if we get the number eight spy, you know, we have a pretty good matchup against Chicago. I mean

[00:53:33.160 --> 00:53:33.520]

Hey, listen, even the Raptors beat the Bulls one game. What the hell does that prove? Yeah, so listen to this asshole

[00:53:43.500 --> 00:53:50.160]
He says that not even because they beat us here the last time because we didn't want to go out and go out and play defense

[00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:57.940]
Okay, but that they might have better talent than we do. Yeah, is he out of his goddamn mind or what I want

[00:58:05.500 --> 00:58:06.340]
Five to two vote

[00:58:06.340 --> 00:58:08.500]
It's binding, it's done, it's science-yield delivered

[00:58:08.500 --> 00:58:09.660]
Yeah, I have a little of that crap

[00:58:09.660 --> 00:58:10.700]
I mean that's good stuff

[00:58:11.800 --> 00:58:13.480]
So how do you like that, huh?

[00:58:14.560 --> 00:58:15.880]
After all of this gnashing a teeth

[00:58:15.880 --> 00:58:18.040]
Didn't I tell you all along it was a done deal

[00:58:18.040 --> 00:58:20.460]
Wasn't I the one voice of sanity in this other way

[00:58:20.460 --> 00:58:21.500]
In the sea of wilderness

[00:58:21.940 --> 00:58:23.360]
That said no problem

[00:58:23.360 --> 00:58:24.540]
Don't worry about it

[00:58:24.540 --> 00:58:25.640]
Rimmer, it's a done deal

[00:58:25.640 --> 00:58:27.440]
After all these hysterical phone calls

[00:58:27.440 --> 00:58:28.540]
And after all these rumors

[00:58:28.540 --> 00:58:30.300]
And after all this innuendo

[00:58:30.300 --> 00:58:32.040]
And hysteria and paranoia

[00:58:32.040 --> 00:58:33.300]
Didn't I say just calm?

[00:58:33.300 --> 00:58:34.440]
It's a done deal

[00:58:34.440 --> 00:58:35.420]
I never said that

[00:58:36.180 --> 00:58:38.300]
So anyway, it's 123 at WIOD

[00:58:39.080 --> 00:58:43.260]
Doctor, are you sure you're going to die with strange taste of movies

[00:58:43.260 --> 00:58:44.720]
What's next?

[00:58:45.180 --> 00:58:46.220]
Neil won't like it

[00:58:46.220 --> 00:58:47.140]
The amateur hour

[00:58:47.140 --> 00:58:48.240]
Sunday night at 11

[00:58:48.240 --> 00:58:50.620]
A news talk and entertainment radio

[00:58:50.620 --> 00:58:51.740]
610

[00:58:51.740 --> 00:58:53.820]
W-I-O-D

[00:58:53.820 --> 00:58:56.180]
Oh Neil, my queen

[00:58:57.080 --> 00:58:57.800]
God

[00:58:59.320 --> 00:59:02.720]
That hill rises into like a boy guy

[00:59:02.720 --> 00:59:03.800]
If you're an APS

[00:59:04.440 --> 00:59:06.220]
To the swish and decide

[00:59:06.220 --> 00:59:07.560]
The smoke of good

[00:59:07.560 --> 00:59:09.620]
Stalk and ride around in your bed

[00:59:09.620 --> 00:59:11.320]
You've got a radio show

[00:59:11.320 --> 00:59:14.080]
You can just for the check

[00:59:14.080 --> 00:59:17.900]
Happy anniversary to Neil

[00:59:20.080 --> 00:59:23.360]
The only thing in this town

[00:59:23.360 --> 00:59:24.540]
That's real

[00:59:27.800 --> 00:59:30.660]
He follows the familiar around

[00:59:30.660 --> 00:59:34.220]
Just to hear that famous farting sound

[00:59:34.220 --> 00:59:36.000]
The only act can't stop

[00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:37.980]
Take the bread off your sandwich

[00:59:37.980 --> 00:59:39.780]
And like a bonus

[00:59:39.780 --> 00:59:42.320]
To Mary Mandage

[00:59:42.320 --> 00:59:46.700]
Neil Rogers, you're the best

[00:59:48.800 --> 00:59:53.700]
You really put my hand me to the test

[00:59:56.820 --> 01:00:01.500]
Neil Rogers always gets to know your day

[01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:09.380]
Neil Rogers turns blind cops into a bear

[01:00:10.700 --> 01:00:15.640]
Neil Rogers, the only thing I miss when I go

[01:00:15.640 --> 01:00:18.260]
I went away for a weekend

[01:00:18.260 --> 01:00:20.940]
Excited town for art of love

[01:00:23.460 --> 01:00:26.120]
But happy anniversary to Neil

[01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:27.880]
I always love your show

[01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:29.000]
OK

[01:00:30.580 --> 01:00:32.280]
Looked 28 at W-I-O-D

[01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:33.560]
It's a great day for the Irish

[01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:34.640]
Did Jewish to Chinese

[01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:36.820]
The Spix, the everybody

[01:00:36.820 --> 01:00:38.320]
It's a hell of a day baby

[01:00:40.020 --> 01:00:41.280]
So we got our own thing

[01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:42.860]
By the way, wonder are they voting also

[01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:44.860]
On the site selection

[01:00:44.860 --> 01:00:45.940]
Are they going to take care of that today

[01:00:45.940 --> 01:00:47.240]
Or are they overwhelmed by the emotion

[01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:48.000]
Look at Johnny Dark

[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:49.220]
He's got a big smile on his face

[01:00:49.220 --> 01:00:51.040]
He said, all right, we got something

[01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:52.480]
And Broward besides do does

[01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:55.080]
They voted five to two yes

[01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:56.140]
It's a binding deal

[01:00:56.140 --> 01:00:57.780]
It's in, we're in

[01:00:57.780 --> 01:00:58.860]
Where they're going to put it now

[01:00:58.860 --> 01:01:00.080]
Up your ass

[01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:01.040]
They can't fit

[01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:02.360]
Yeah, can

[01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:05.540]
So anyway, I don't know whether

[01:01:05.540 --> 01:01:06.740]
I just was asking that

[01:01:06.740 --> 01:01:07.680]
Oh, there's IMS again

[01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:09.240]
Just what he needs is some more publicity

[01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:09.660]
OK

[01:01:09.660 --> 01:01:11.240]
I guess they got tired of Howard

[01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:12.580]
So now we're going to have IMS on

[01:01:12.580 --> 01:01:13.580]
Every God damn channel

[01:01:13.580 --> 01:01:14.500]
Morning noon and night

[01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:15.540]
Before we croaks

[01:01:15.540 --> 01:01:16.520]
Which ought to be pretty soon

[01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:17.300]
From the looks of it

[01:01:17.300 --> 01:01:18.940]
God, does he look bad or what?

[01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:21.920]
I beg your pardon?

[01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:23.600]
He's got a 28 year old girlfriend at least

[01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:24.980]
I hate, I grant him that

[01:01:24.980 --> 01:01:25.660]
She's pretty cute

[01:01:25.660 --> 01:01:26.020]
Sure, too

[01:01:26.020 --> 01:01:27.560]
She's a real cute little blonde piece

[01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:29.480]
She's a, I thought she was 30, uh

[01:01:29.940 --> 01:01:30.860]
31 or two

[01:01:30.860 --> 01:01:31.480]
Blonde what?

[01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:32.100]
Piece

[01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:35.680]
Yeah, a vase

[01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:36.900]
So what's wrong with that?

[01:01:37.020 --> 01:01:38.560]
Oh, you can't say that on the coast

[01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:39.080]
I know that

[01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:39.900]
You wouldn't go over there and say

[01:01:39.900 --> 01:01:40.980]
Hey, how about that?

[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:42.540]
I'm a said-out beautiful piece of ass

[01:01:42.540 --> 01:01:44.420]
He's a, you wouldn't say that on the coast

[01:01:44.420 --> 01:01:46.240]
You might actually have some numbers over there, OK?

[01:01:46.580 --> 01:01:48.080]
This is because you got a bunch of dumb

[01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:50.340]
Julio's listening to Gloria Estefan records all day

[01:01:50.340 --> 01:01:52.000]
Why just stop playing that bitch, OK?

[01:01:52.180 --> 01:01:52.600]
Butch up

[01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:55.000]
Take those goddamn CDs in here and burn them

[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:55.940]
We love her

[01:01:55.940 --> 01:01:57.120]
Yeah, bitch you do

[01:01:57.120 --> 01:01:58.220]
You hate her like poison

[01:01:58.220 --> 01:01:59.080]
Why don't you be honest

[01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:01.160]
Why don't you say this is IOD not the coast

[01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:03.100]
You can't stand Gloria Estefan

[01:02:03.100 --> 01:02:04.000]
I like her

[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:05.740]
You wouldn't touch her with a 10 foot tongue

[01:02:05.740 --> 01:02:07.160]
Oh, I was, she's great

[01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:08.260]
Yeah, you, look at that

[01:02:08.260 --> 01:02:10.000]
He's got his legs crossed when he's sanded

[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:11.580]
His eyes, his legs, and his tongue

[01:02:12.100 --> 01:02:13.200]
He speaks with a fork tongue

[01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:16.480]
So we got the arena so Mickey Harrison stick it up your ass

[01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:16.720]
Oh

[01:02:17.940 --> 01:02:20.900]
And all you, goi, I'm over there at the Harold, all you anti-Semites

[01:02:20.900 --> 01:02:22.720]
Wipe your ass with your newspaper, OK?

[01:02:23.020 --> 01:02:24.400]
Because we got it and guess what?

[01:02:24.620 --> 01:02:25.400]
We're gonna build it

[01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:27.200]
The arena date will never be built

[01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:28.100]
Are they gonna put it in the sawgrass?

[01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:28.480]
I hope

[01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:29.380]
I don't know

[01:02:29.380 --> 01:02:31.820]
I just got you asking that question before you open the door

[01:02:31.820 --> 01:02:33.120]
And waddled your fat ass in here

[01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:34.540]
I hope so that would be nice

[01:02:34.540 --> 01:02:35.240]
Now what do you care?

[01:02:35.300 --> 01:02:35.960]
You're not going there

[01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:37.480]
I don't want it to I-90

[01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:38.180]
I don't know if they have concerts

[01:02:38.180 --> 01:02:39.180]
I don't want it to be a-

[01:02:39.180 --> 01:02:41.540]
How about if they have some hillbilly in there, OK?

[01:02:41.660 --> 01:02:42.960]
Then you'd love going and see it

[01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:44.100]
I want it at the sawgrass

[01:02:44.100 --> 01:02:44.540]
For what?

[01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:45.980]
Because that's where it should be

[01:02:45.980 --> 01:02:47.220]
Right, because that's where it should be

[01:02:47.220 --> 01:02:49.100]
And Johnny Darks a man who stands up for principle

[01:02:49.100 --> 01:02:50.580]
Even always full of crap

[01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:53.480]
Plus he figures he can get some pre-concert tickets

[01:02:53.480 --> 01:02:54.760]
And you don't want to go to Broward 95

[01:02:54.760 --> 01:02:56.300]
Because there's too many dark folks over there

[01:02:56.300 --> 01:02:57.140]
And they don't listen to the coast

[01:02:57.140 --> 01:02:57.980]
So what does he care?

[01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:00.180]
Here's not true, you don't have no-

[01:03:00.180 --> 01:03:01.760]
How many blacklisters do you have on a coast?

[01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:02.940]
One, one

[01:03:02.940 --> 01:03:04.680]
And he said they got him tied up in a room somewhere

[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:06.740]
Like in clockwork or in sets right

[01:03:06.740 --> 01:03:10.480]
Instead of Beethoven, they're playing Gloria Estefan over and over and over

[01:03:10.480 --> 01:03:12.140]
Oh, God, a fate worse than death

[01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:15.480]
So anyway, here's the Hollywood, hello

[01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:16.180]
Neil

[01:03:16.180 --> 01:03:16.720]
Yes, sir

[01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:18.580]
How do you like the good news, pal?

[01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:19.740]
Oh, I think it's excellent

[01:03:19.740 --> 01:03:20.760]
Well, hey, for Hollywood

[01:03:21.380 --> 01:03:23.160]
I went to the first anthors game last night

[01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:24.960]
And I had a great time

[01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:25.680]
All right

[01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:28.800]
Now we got 30 years, 30 more years of Panthers

[01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:29.540]
How do you like that?

[01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:30.660]
I think it's excellent

[01:03:30.660 --> 01:03:32.200]
You know, I actually did work, Johnny

[01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:32.740]
I heard him was playing

[01:03:32.740 --> 01:03:34.080]
I dropped the short dust last night

[01:03:34.740 --> 01:03:35.660]
With that little penalty here

[01:03:35.660 --> 01:03:36.560]
Yeah, he tried hard

[01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:37.620]
They pulled it out

[01:03:37.620 --> 01:03:39.680]
I guess he thought there was like a minute 15 left

[01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:41.220]
He didn't realize it was only 15 seconds

[01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:41.960]
Yeah

[01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:45.260]
You know, I think it's a make it real exciting, that's scruey

[01:03:45.260 --> 01:03:47.040]
You know, they should have buried them though

[01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:49.220]
I really think that they're gonna suck it up

[01:03:49.220 --> 01:03:50.760]
Because it's crunch time now

[01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:52.880]
Yeah, we played that real conservative third period

[01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:54.340]
And we almost paid a wicked price for it

[01:03:54.340 --> 01:03:56.100]
Exactly, you know, they're not a good idea

[01:03:56.480 --> 01:03:56.840]
Yeah

[01:03:56.840 --> 01:03:58.480]
The puck was down in the way, it was in the hole

[01:03:58.480 --> 01:04:00.260]
That's okay, we'll take the two points, thank you

[01:04:00.260 --> 01:04:01.980]
We'll take Buffalo, Beaton Montreal up there

[01:04:01.980 --> 01:04:03.540]
Thank you, so we're back in fourth place

[01:04:03.540 --> 01:04:06.080]
Now, seeing now, I can really get enthusiastic

[01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:08.040]
Because now it's not just a temporary little thing

[01:04:08.040 --> 01:04:09.540]
Now it's a part of our lives

[01:04:09.540 --> 01:04:10.060]
Exactly

[01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:12.820]
And now we can look forward to no more at the arena

[01:04:12.820 --> 01:04:14.040]
And hopefully something in Broward

[01:04:14.040 --> 01:04:14.220]
Right

[01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:17.180]
Hopefully it'll be at the sawgrass, I like that location also

[01:04:17.180 --> 01:04:17.480]
Right

[01:04:17.860 --> 01:04:19.880]
So, listening to your bend over from a couple of tickets

[01:04:20.700 --> 01:04:22.720]
Bend over, Johnny, he says he wants to bend over

[01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:23.160]
What do you think?

[01:04:23.860 --> 01:04:24.760]
Johnny, Johnny, just

[01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:26.080]
I would talk about it rather bend over

[01:04:26.080 --> 01:04:27.340]
Johnny just said, cock a moon

[01:04:27.780 --> 01:04:28.560]
Okay, hang on

[01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:29.040]
Thank you

[01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:30.860]
Line 5, that's our last pair of free tickets

[01:04:30.860 --> 01:04:33.260]
Okay, for now, that hockey game against Tampa Bay

[01:04:33.260 --> 01:04:36.100]
And every game from here on out should be sold out

[01:04:37.460 --> 01:04:40.580]
You know, I'm going to have to say something on the year now that I never thought I would say

[01:04:40.580 --> 01:04:44.400]
It takes a big man to sit his ass in this year and say what I'm going to say, okay

[01:04:45.420 --> 01:04:49.020]
First of all, let's thank that little Jew Gary Bettman for coming down and doing a good job

[01:04:49.020 --> 01:04:50.680]
Because we never would have got this through without Gary

[01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:52.240]
Thanks Gary, we love you sweetheart

[01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:54.600]
Even though you were kind of a bozo during the lockout

[01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:56.440]
Thanks to Gary Bettman, he's okay

[01:04:56.440 --> 01:04:59.660]
You knew a little Jew could come out here and finnaigle those guys up in Broward

[01:05:00.440 --> 01:05:02.520]
But as far as Wayne is concerned

[01:05:02.520 --> 01:05:05.060]
You know what, I never thought you know what we're going to do

[01:05:05.960 --> 01:05:06.360]
George

[01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:08.440]
George

[01:05:09.740 --> 01:05:12.020]
We're going to take every one of those songs

[01:05:12.900 --> 01:05:15.580]
That's in the DCS and we're taking them out

[01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:19.300]
You know what I'm talking about

[01:05:19.300 --> 01:05:20.360]
Out to lunch

[01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:22.940]
All the Wayne songs were taking them out

[01:05:24.360 --> 01:05:26.040]
Never to be played on his show again

[01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:31.140]
Because I'm not here, you know, I'm not saying that anything that I've said the last two years is wrong

[01:05:31.140 --> 01:05:34.120]
Because Wayne's done a lot of things to piss off a lot of people including me, but

[01:05:35.220 --> 01:05:40.780]
But when push came the shove here's a guy to cut us all the team to Nashville to Portland to all kinds of places

[01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:42.920]
They were desperate for this team

[01:05:43.560 --> 01:05:45.500]
He could have said screw you guys, okay

[01:05:45.500 --> 01:05:48.200]
I'm losing 20 million a year in that piece of direct down there

[01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:51.100]
I'm putting up with that little asshole Mickey Ererson. I've had it

[01:05:52.060 --> 01:05:53.940]
And he finally found something he liked

[01:05:54.400 --> 01:05:57.540]
He's not that crazy about that whole Marlon deal over there from what I hear

[01:05:57.540 --> 01:06:01.180]
He's not all that crazy about the dolphins unless Jimmy J turns that thing around

[01:06:01.740 --> 01:06:04.820]
He likes the uh, he likes the Panthers. He let his into it

[01:06:05.340 --> 01:06:06.840]
He's there most of the games

[01:06:08.420 --> 01:06:13.460]
He's standing up when I have the free t-shirts. He's standing there. I want it. I want it like everybody else

[01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:19.360]
So we we're gonna kiss his ass right here collectively come on Wayne

[01:06:19.860 --> 01:06:20.840]
That's for you sweetheart

[01:06:21.700 --> 01:06:26.220]
All is forgiven come home here's a guy that because without his going out there and

[01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:31.000]
Underwriting all this stuff and all the guarantees without every extra thing that he did

[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:36.040]
There would be no arena and I guarantee you no Panthers and no hockey and just like Gary Bettman said last night

[01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:40.220]
Don't think if you lose this team you're gonna be getting another franchise real quick because it's highly unlikely

[01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:47.100]
So we're kissing Wayne's ass today. How do you like that? I'm doing it personal on both cheeks

[01:06:48.320 --> 01:06:48.920]
That's right

[01:06:49.800 --> 01:06:55.280]
It's an embarrassing thing for a grown man to have to do to eat a little bit of crow. Let's put some of this Wayne Arnold hot sauce on it

[01:06:55.280 --> 01:06:55.900]
Not so bad

[01:06:57.400 --> 01:07:01.200]
Thanks to Wayne and thanks for the guy that picked up the food. That's my good pal. What are your Toronto clock?

[01:07:01.820 --> 01:07:04.920]
And by the way did we find out who those guys were at the end of our roll last night or not

[01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:08.240]
That's the most important thing make sure they come back again soon

[01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:15.220]
It's the bitch though. I mean uh, so anyway, thanks Wayne from the bottom of our parts. Okay, Wayne high ping eyes

[01:07:15.220 --> 01:07:20.160]
See I started doing it again. I started calling them that grotesque that unacceptable name

[01:07:20.160 --> 01:07:20.160]

[01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:26.480]
Fiber say that again dump it and then let me know where you're working the day after that

[01:07:28.520 --> 01:07:29.280]
Thanks Wayne

[01:07:29.820 --> 01:07:36.220]
Thanks Gary thanks Bill Tory thanks Brian Murray. Thanks for the memories even at Doug McCleaney and doing so good lately screw him

[01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:38.560]
But let's thank all the other guys

[01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:44.120]
Because we finally got something good. We're gonna keep it and brown and those guys in dead you can dittle around now

[01:07:44.120 --> 01:07:46.500]
You can screw around from now until the end of time

[01:07:46.500 --> 01:07:52.720]
This is a binding. It's written. It's engraved in braille and stone. It's etched in marble. How do you like that?

[01:07:52.740 --> 01:07:55.180]
That's what Jennifer just said and she better not be making it up

[01:07:57.340 --> 01:08:01.860]
135 at W.I.O. Did you ever get the feeling that it was your hairline slowly received so does your image

[01:08:02.580 --> 01:08:07.820]
Take a look at Wayne see there. We goes again 10 seconds out of the box. He's starting to pick on him again

[01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:15.780]
The news that matters to you county's there. We're not a table in the program

[01:08:15.780 --> 01:08:19.320]
Before the program exists there now and attainment who both were involved

[01:08:19.860 --> 01:08:23.640]
Coast Guard officials did question both parties finally the cops

[01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:26.320]
I've gotten off the idea that we have all the answers

[01:08:27.480 --> 01:08:29.520]
News talking entertainment radio

[01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:36.800]
610 W I O D. Let's just go get drunk. We've been friends for a long time. We've gone through a lot together

[01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:41.760]
Yep, I guess I've never told you what you mean to me. I love you man

[01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:47.880]
So can I have your sunlight sure or take it have the whole six back. Hey thanks. Now come here and give me a big kiss sugar lump

[01:08:47.880 --> 01:08:49.680]
What kiss me full on the mouth?

[01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:54.920]
Wait a minute. I think there's been a misunderstanding here. I just wanted your beer and I just want your hand on my

[01:08:54.920 --> 01:09:00.460]
Tush don't deny our love my little sweet cake now come here. Hey get your hand of me. That's not my hand

[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000]
You'll do anything for a sunlight

[01:09:06.100 --> 01:09:07.240]
Well almost anything

[01:09:08.260 --> 01:09:14.040]
So anyway 20 till two I'm having my own little party here. I see Andy's participating in George and Mark

[01:09:14.540 --> 01:09:16.780]
And Johnny dark mark in the dark

[01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:22.060]
Have a little Wayne Arnold here to celebrate which is always good for up. Good laugh or two

[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:23.600]
That's right

[01:09:24.380 --> 01:09:29.900]
So anyway all we want to do is say one thing to Mickey Arizona came out that I've kissed way not both cheeks

[01:09:29.900 --> 01:09:34.080]
Hey Mickey take your heat and stick them in your rectum. I mean like way inside there, baby

[01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:34.280]
If

[01:09:35.480 --> 01:09:44.540]
If there's still room after that six six six that's tattooed inside your cheeks just like it is on the on the inside of the anus of our good friend over there at Tony Ritter at the heraldah

[01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:49.620]
See what they were trying to do they really thought that they had this thing all nailed down

[01:09:49.620 --> 01:09:50.900]
Maybe they're going to do their little

[01:09:50.900 --> 01:09:56.200]
Sub-diffuse there the Broward Commission is going to start getting real weak at the knees which they did

[01:09:56.200 --> 01:09:58.920]
They're going to pee in their pants and they're going to back out which they did not

[01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:03.980]
And the panthers are going to get out of town which they are not and they he'll have their own ball game

[01:10:03.980 --> 01:10:05.880]
Well guess what the heat now is sucking wind

[01:10:07.580 --> 01:10:11.700]
Because if something happens not just a Dan Paul thing, but if anything else happens

[01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:17.500]
And this thing falls through which I guarantee that it will and they'll never build that arena indeed where is the heat going to play

[01:10:18.820 --> 01:10:21.140]
How about maybe in juneven New York sounds good to me

[01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:25.840]
How about in your arena that they're already in the present arena

[01:10:26.580 --> 01:10:32.880]
Mickey Erison's gonna have to probably come up some way with his good buddies to shell out some extra money to put a few skyboxes in here

[01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:36.200]
If they can do it and maybe some extra seats like up on a roof looking down

[01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:38.220]
And that's where he's going to be stuck

[01:10:39.180 --> 01:10:39.580]
See

[01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:46.860]
It's the anti-Christ see what goes on the onions are like coming from the front of my mouth down to the back of my throat

[01:10:46.860 --> 01:10:49.720]
And I'm not even chewing them it's the goddamn anti-Christ

[01:10:51.800 --> 01:10:58.620]
The spirit of Christ compels you that's what I'm saying right now Mickey Erison and you jackasses over at the Miami Herald

[01:10:58.620 --> 01:11:06.580]
Especially but not exclusively Tony Ritter the spirit of Christ compels you to take on your BS in your devious ways and insert them deep inside your

[01:11:06.580 --> 01:11:07.720]
Brackum right now

[01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:09.720]
How do you like that

[01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:17.380]
We finally got something that made sense done okay they can call it the Wayne Heizinghi arena for all I care

[01:11:17.900 --> 01:11:23.040]
We're gonna get it and he's that's it and so he is in many ways a jackass and asshole

[01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:27.060]
I don't want to say that word on here, but hey when the bottom line comes when push came to shove

[01:11:27.060 --> 01:11:31.300]
Here's the guy that bailed our ass out. Thank you Wayne on both cheeks

[01:11:33.060 --> 01:11:35.500]
Here's the mobile in Miami Beach hello. How you doing?

[01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:41.740]
Okay, take there's takes everywhere in Miami Beach today metro and Miami Beach great

[01:11:41.740 --> 01:11:47.260]
They are actually on on pine tree drive. They are they have a checkpoint. They're stopping at checkpoint Charlie again

[01:11:47.260 --> 01:11:51.340]
Here we go every single car and they're checking for passport and ID

[01:11:52.220 --> 01:11:52.780]
Yeah

[01:11:52.780 --> 01:11:57.340]
That's out of control. Yeah, and also you know, they're probably checking to see if any people from Broward are down here

[01:11:57.340 --> 01:12:03.360]
They have it on 27th and out on road and 61st and out on road. They have all the checkpoint. It's a nightmare

[01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:05.180]
Okay, like what are they doing?

[01:12:05.980 --> 01:12:11.860]
Making it safe for us. Oh, yes, of course. I mean, my god forbid I have my car stolen two weeks ago

[01:12:11.860 --> 01:12:18.840]
And now this is what my money my tax money is being bought for checkpoint Charlie even in Nazi Germany never had anything like this

[01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:22.740]
Control. All right. Good luck to pal. I'm out of here. Okay

[01:12:23.740 --> 01:12:25.280]
So we got two open lines in date

[01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:29.600]
We gave away all our 10 pair of hockey tickets now. We can feel like all this bull crap is over

[01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:32.360]
But I do want to ask that question to my who's gonna tell me the answer

[01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:37.220]
Because that's obviously right away. We wanted to find out you know the answer to the question

[01:12:37.220 --> 01:12:38.620]
Are we getting it or not which we are?

[01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:43.440]
Thank god, but what about the site selection isn't that where they were supposed to pick that out today?

[01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:47.840]
Is it going to be the soil grass? Is it going to be God from midbroward 95?

[01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:52.320]
Which we'll take it if that's the best we can get or is it going to be up in pop it oh park which I seriously doubt

[01:12:52.840 --> 01:12:54.580]
Ted smell I seriously doubt it

[01:12:56.180 --> 01:12:59.680]
Here's Hollywood on a purple line. Hello. Hello Neil. Yes, sir. Got a great

[01:13:00.140 --> 01:13:06.600]
Hallumdale story for you. Okay. I get a new a elevator to go visit my grandmother. She lives on a 20s first floor guys

[01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:10.720]
Two guys in front of me they they're in the elevator with me

[01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:14.520]
They hit 17 and then what I got to go 17 floors with these guys

[01:13:15.180 --> 01:13:20.660]
One said to the other I need to get my clay pot moved off my terrace and the other guy says

[01:13:20.660 --> 01:13:25.800]
Well, aren't you asked Ryan to do it? He says is Ryan the white guy is either black guy. He said he's the black guy

[01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:28.760]
He says well don't ask him to do it because he's lazy

[01:13:31.380 --> 01:13:31.820]
Yeah

[01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:34.740]
And that's the story

[01:13:34.740 --> 01:13:37.360]
Well, it's indicative of how the

[01:13:37.940 --> 01:13:42.300]
The old Jewish people were using a stereotype and I'm Jewish so I just thought that

[01:13:42.940 --> 01:13:47.440]
Me being Jewish was ridiculous in stereotype in black guy who the black guy was Jewish

[01:13:48.340 --> 01:13:54.380]
I'm Jewish yeah, and the black guy was Jewish ask Sammy Davis to do it. Okay. He'll do it. What the hell's he talking about

[01:13:55.440 --> 01:14:00.060]
He had thought he said he had a great story. Well, maybe he's saving a great story for the next time when we still have some tickets left

[01:14:00.060 --> 01:14:01.480]
Thanks a lot pal. You're okay

[01:14:02.900 --> 01:14:07.500]
Here's a Hollywood on a purple line is good. Well, I don't I don't understand what's going on here purple line

[01:14:07.500 --> 01:14:12.080]
Just opened up mobile one somewhere. How was I? I'm in a state of euphoria plus it must be too many of these

[01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:12.620]
Whitehods

[01:14:14.060 --> 01:14:15.700]
Here's Miami. Hello

[01:14:16.280 --> 01:14:20.100]
Hello, yes, sir Neil. How you doing? Okay? I haven't seen you in a while

[01:14:20.100 --> 01:14:26.340]
Last time I was having breakfast courtesy of Rick and suds and you walked in in the bouquet of the studio

[01:14:26.340 --> 01:14:30.320]
You didn't about face immediately. Yeah, you call that day. No

[01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:35.180]
Okay, I called I just walked in I heard about the tickets, but I see they're gone

[01:14:35.180 --> 01:14:39.900]
But I want to let you know something anyway. I've tried to call on a couple occasions they have this

[01:14:39.900 --> 01:14:40.220]
um

[01:14:41.820 --> 01:14:44.640]
Magazine type thing put out by the greater Miami

[01:14:46.280 --> 01:14:53.120]
Culture events the affairs council. Uh-huh, and they get all the like the marlin's games in here and the heat games

[01:14:53.740 --> 01:14:57.560]
Never mentioned of any Panther game. Yeah, of course not because they're about your anti-Semites

[01:14:57.560 --> 01:14:59.660]
They want the hockey team out of here. How do you like that?

[01:15:00.240 --> 01:15:02.340]
Just like the hero you're not full of us over there

[01:15:02.340 --> 01:15:05.540]
That's why you give us crappy coverage because you don't like hockey. You don't like the Panthers

[01:15:05.540 --> 01:15:09.080]
And if they don't like something man, they want it out if it's not part of their little

[01:15:09.080 --> 01:15:11.080]
Their little empire. They want to get rid of it

[01:15:11.940 --> 01:15:15.520]
Huh incredible. How do you like that? Well, we got a real surprise for them

[01:15:16.420 --> 01:15:19.820]
I'll wait and see it. Okay. Take care. Good luck to you pal. You'll need it

[01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:25.740]
So we got an open line indeed 751 W I O D on a great day here in the history of South Florida

[01:15:25.740 --> 01:15:27.700]
Marketown on your calendar April 2

[01:15:28.620 --> 01:15:31.760]
1996 it's the day after April fool, but we're not fooling okay

[01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:36.800]
So now it's gonna be real interesting to see if Mickey's gonna go it alone over there

[01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:40.100]
Over there by the port of Miami with their billion dollar boom doglet

[01:15:40.100 --> 01:15:45.620]
They're gonna build and they'll probably stick to goddamn metro mover right out there to drop you in the middle of the guy damn bay

[01:15:45.620 --> 01:15:46.920]
How does that sound huh?

[01:15:47.980 --> 01:15:53.300]
You just slide off the end of the metro mover and they'll drop you right off of there and you can swim your way into the arena

[01:15:53.300 --> 01:15:54.280]
That sounds good to me

[01:15:55.460 --> 01:15:57.980]
Because quite frankly, I think you're drowning over there Mickey

[01:15:57.980 --> 01:16:02.640]
I think that you've really cut off more than you can chew maybe daddy's got more money than Wayne

[01:16:02.640 --> 01:16:08.880]
But when it comes to a battle of egos you're not even in the ballgame. Okay, Mickey you hot shot dot the eye

[01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:11.860]
Mr. Hot shot he was gonna show everybody

[01:16:11.860 --> 01:16:16.680]
He was gonna pull off this cute little trick of his he was gonna chase everybody outside of town

[01:16:16.680 --> 01:16:18.320]
So we can have the whole ball game to himself

[01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:25.740]
You can take your goddamn basketball and pat Riley and your heat and all gods a mishpacha and stick them all inside your

[01:16:25.740 --> 01:16:27.680]
Bracum and keep them there. How do you like that?

[01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:31.620]
And Linda Blirris is high by the way. Yeah, that's right

[01:16:33.140 --> 01:16:34.800]
147 at W.I.O.D

[01:16:35.760 --> 01:16:36.160]

610 W.I.O.D

[01:16:42.380 --> 01:16:43.560]
It's a party out there

[01:16:50.660 --> 01:16:53.560]
Moils in the hockey night in Canada on TV

[01:16:55.440 --> 01:16:57.480]
What you buy moils and exports

[01:16:58.080 --> 01:17:00.020]
Excess it all

[01:17:00.980 --> 01:17:04.440]
By board of Canada where quality is job one

[01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:11.400]
Here's working by imperial oil and desu associates proud to be one of the leading sponsors of you talking in Canada

[01:17:12.100 --> 01:17:14.820]
And by Pepsi gotta have it

[01:17:22.600 --> 01:17:23.340]
Yes

[01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:25.420]
Yes

[01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:28.760]
So anyway 151 at W.I.O.D

[01:17:28.760 --> 01:17:31.980]
We can put this all aside now we can come back to a little bit of normalcy

[01:17:31.980 --> 01:17:35.040]
We can relax take a deep breath and just move on to our next major crisis

[01:17:36.020 --> 01:17:37.960]
Here's a mobile at derail hello

[01:17:37.960 --> 01:17:39.540]
Hello, Neil. Yes

[01:17:40.020 --> 01:17:46.920]
It's a beautiful day. Yes, it is. The sunny shining somewhere. I mean if this is wonderful. I mean finally that I show that

[01:17:46.920 --> 01:17:48.020]
Herald people

[01:17:49.340 --> 01:17:52.880]
I mean, you know it was close. I thought it wasn't gonna go through

[01:17:53.400 --> 01:17:57.320]
But I had my serious doubts. I mean, you know, you raved doubts. I mean

[01:17:57.660 --> 01:18:01.900]
So now it looks like they're gonna have to stuff it down here in Miami. Yeah, let them stuff it

[01:18:01.900 --> 01:18:06.340]
Well, you know, I mean, it's gonna be kind of hard to swing by people with just 220 million dollars they want

[01:18:07.060 --> 01:18:11.100]
Well, it started out 165 now. It's I think up to about 300 million by today

[01:18:11.100 --> 01:18:14.800]
Just keep the numbers keep changing every day. I really doubt they're gonna do that. Uh-huh

[01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:19.120]
So I guess they'll be playing in the up and um, rowart's good. Well, won't they if they let them in?

[01:18:19.620 --> 01:18:19.980]
Uh

[01:18:20.380 --> 01:18:26.080]
Oh for a fee if they let them in and of course if they do let them in now they're gonna be like the secondary tenant and they're gonna be sucking wind

[01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:29.680]
Again, isn't that a bad break for them big deal. Yeah

[01:18:29.680 --> 01:18:34.140]
You know pat which you have to get used to rowart. That's all yeah pataldists have to get a different hairdo

[01:18:34.140 --> 01:18:37.220]
Yeah, and in closing Neil. Yes, sir. Wait. I've saying that

[01:18:37.220 --> 01:18:38.320]
Your meal

[01:18:38.840 --> 01:18:39.520]
There you go

[01:18:40.940 --> 01:18:45.840]
See where kissing is asked today. We finally realized, you know everybody kissed and made up

[01:18:47.200 --> 01:18:51.900]
He treated us pretty crappy there for while he said some bad things he did some bad things

[01:18:51.900 --> 01:18:55.800]
He quite frankly was an asshole for a while and he finally said you know something

[01:18:55.800 --> 01:19:00.440]
I want to show everybody. I'm not always an asshole and he said let me show you how much I'm sincere about this

[01:19:00.440 --> 01:19:05.260]
And I'm gonna do something and he did it. Okay, and we're saying all right. Just don't do it again

[01:19:07.540 --> 01:19:09.540]
Here's a lady mobile in Miami. Hello

Here's the mobile in Hollywood. Hello. How are you today, buddy? Fantastic. Yeah, there's never ever a chance that two arenas are gonna make it

[01:21:00.140 --> 01:21:05.040]
It's lucky to take a hit fill one arena right now. There's no possible way in the world

[01:21:05.040 --> 01:21:11.560]
That this town can afford two arena. Yeah, what is your feedback on that mr. Rogers?

[01:21:11.920 --> 01:21:15.520]
My feedback is I don't think there's gonna be two arenas is gonna be one in Broward

[01:21:15.520 --> 01:21:18.140]
Oh, definitely. I don't think the data arena is ever gonna be built

[01:21:18.140 --> 01:21:20.460]
That's what I've been saying for like three days now

[01:21:20.460 --> 01:21:23.540]
I know that and another thing is I'm so happy. I'm every night

[01:21:23.540 --> 01:21:29.120]
I have to drive through howl mill to get the Hollywood and the Canadians are history. They're gone

[01:21:29.660 --> 01:21:31.800]
Thank God that's all I could say

[01:21:33.100 --> 01:21:33.540]

[01:21:35.900 --> 01:21:36.780]
Yeah, God

[01:21:40.540 --> 01:21:44.400]
Okay, I have no idea what it was but it was moving and it was moving north real fast

[01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:49.280]
Okay, hopefully it was about your frogs old ones if you ever noticed how all the your frogs that come down here

[01:21:49.280 --> 01:21:50.040]
They're all real old

[01:21:50.760 --> 01:21:55.300]
They're all older than death. Don't they understand we got enough old people here already

[01:21:55.300 --> 01:22:01.420]
We don't need a new shipment every fall. Okay, every winter. We don't need a new shipment of death of the king rotting bodies

[01:22:01.420 --> 01:22:06.040]
We got plenty of our own already. Thank you send some living and breathing young people. They may be okay

[01:22:06.040 --> 01:22:10.920]
Okay, so we find out who that was in the row or not yet probably related to somebody here and I better shut up

[01:22:11.880 --> 01:22:15.840]
Here's Orlando. Hello. Hi, Neil. You're a happy camper. Yes, sir

[01:22:16.680 --> 01:22:18.980]
You can make some extra money with parking now too

[01:22:19.400 --> 01:22:21.680]
Yeah, right. That's right good idea anyway

[01:22:23.180 --> 01:22:26.040]
Why would the heat not want to play in broder?

[01:22:26.980 --> 01:22:28.040]
Don't you understand

[01:22:29.800 --> 01:22:33.600]
Mickey Erison's whole thing is down there at the port of Miami. I don't want to go back through the whole thing again

[01:22:33.600 --> 01:22:36.580]
Okay, his whole deal is at the port of Miami

[01:22:36.580 --> 01:22:41.360]
Well, there'll be knocking on the broder arena pretty soon. Well the door. It's too late. I think door shut

[01:22:41.960 --> 01:22:47.340]
Out to lunch a minute ago when you were playing that bit with all the Jewish people and you said something about Harry

[01:22:47.340 --> 01:22:49.300]
Carrie well is probably an hour ago. Yeah

[01:22:50.860 --> 01:22:55.020]
Did you know Harry Carrie's grandson was the commentator for the magic

[01:22:56.940 --> 01:23:03.900]
Yes chip yeah, what why did you say it like nobody knows who chip carriers? I didn't know if he happens to be a very handsome young man

[01:23:03.900 --> 01:23:10.220]
Yes, he does pretty good job in the games. Yeah, and his son his son and his father is a skip carry with the braves

[01:23:10.220 --> 01:23:15.920]
Right. Yeah, and his father's Harry Carrie with the cubs and his father's dead. Well, obviously you know right

[01:23:16.340 --> 01:23:22.520]
Well, Neil you had a great show and I listened to you all last week on vacation and it was really good

[01:23:22.520 --> 01:23:27.280]

Push comes this job give me all a credit. I'm the one I got it done

[01:23:48.560 --> 01:23:53.540]
You got it? It wasn't for my enthusiasm for my tenacity and perspicacity and perseverance

[01:23:53.540 --> 01:23:55.220]
This thing never would have gotten done

[01:23:55.220 --> 01:23:58.420]
We have a little credit to Wayne a little bit to a Gary Batman. Yes

[01:23:58.420 --> 01:24:03.140]
A little bit to the commissioners, but generally speaking it was me that put it over the top that is right

[01:24:03.140 --> 01:24:07.640]
You did it you said see go thing. We are on the one that made hockey the important thing

[01:24:07.640 --> 01:24:11.320]
I made it the center the focal the centerpiece of so many lives in his town

[01:24:11.320 --> 01:24:16.900]
I'm the one that gets the credit you down the Neil Downs Arena and you did a great job right compliment

[01:24:17.780 --> 01:24:19.420]
Goodbye see you okay

[01:24:21.720 --> 01:24:23.020]
157 at W.I.O.D.

[01:24:24.100 --> 01:24:31.760]
Let's do a antenna. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. I want to say congratulations. Mickey Harrison on your new dry dock boat on the arena. Right

[01:24:32.500 --> 01:24:36.720]
Hope you know what I mean. Hope it don't sink. It's gonna be a storm boats in a few years. Uh-huh

[01:24:36.720 --> 01:24:38.640]
Stick it up your ass. Right

[01:24:39.820 --> 01:24:42.660]
Okay, now they're Mickey Harrison fan right there for you

[01:24:43.600 --> 01:24:46.680]
So all the more reason to stick it to the Harold baby just tell him hey

[01:24:46.680 --> 01:24:50.240]
Guess what you didn't pull the wall over our eyes especially those of us who live in Broward

[01:24:50.240 --> 01:24:54.700]
And you can take your paper and shove it to are they voting on the site selection also today?

[01:24:54.860 --> 01:24:58.520]
Do we know though they are not when are they gonna do that? Uh, I don't know

[01:24:58.520 --> 01:25:03.220]
But a portion of that article you were talking about this morning the sunset in the dark. Yeah

[01:25:03.760 --> 01:25:06.240]
Was inaccurate. Oh, that's a first for them. Yeah

[01:25:06.920 --> 01:25:11.840]
And and we were right this morning. See we were right. How do you like that? John Rodstrom God

[01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:16.520]
That's all I can say we were right and the Sun Sentinel as usual a day late in the dollar short

[01:25:16.520 --> 01:25:21.760]
Trying to accentuate the negative because they live in the shadow of the Miami Herald and there are a bunch of pussies

[01:25:21.760 --> 01:25:28.140]
That's right the Sun Sentinel don't have the balls maybe once in a while Dave Hyder some of the individual columnists have got the balls

[01:25:28.140 --> 01:25:30.600]
To go up there and write a real column and say something

[01:25:30.600 --> 01:25:37.420]
But generally speaking the editorial board of the Sums Scom Sentinel are a bunch of pussies and they were intimidated by the Mickey

[01:25:37.420 --> 01:25:40.880]
Erison's of this world and by the goddamn Miami Herald and Nightrider

[01:25:40.880 --> 01:25:44.180]
And that's why they had that stupid and sipping sucking call

[01:25:44.180 --> 01:25:48.940]
editorial this morning about well leave the door open for the heat and don't lock them out

[01:25:48.940 --> 01:25:50.560]
No, you know all this other crap

[01:25:51.180 --> 01:25:54.700]
If they're there fine if they're not there who gives a crap, okay

[01:25:56.220 --> 01:26:00.460]
Because the bottom line is that Mickey Erison lied he tried to stick it to us

[01:26:00.600 --> 01:26:07.840]
He tried to play a little nasty hostile vicious game with his selfish selfish most the disgusting goddamn attitude

[01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:12.680]
See when you're born into all that money when daddy's got the billions with a bee in the sides

[01:26:12.680 --> 01:26:16.940]
I'm going to Israel to become a professional Jew I'm gonna have all the goddamn money here

[01:26:16.940 --> 01:26:20.520]
I'm gonna show everybody what I'm made of okay. We saw it. We can smell it

[01:26:20.520 --> 01:26:24.540]
We know what you're made of Mickey. We can smell it right over here, baby. There it is

[01:26:25.080 --> 01:26:29.500]
So pilot deep keep giving that shovel going in fact he's he's building a new arena right now

[01:26:29.500 --> 01:26:35.180]
And the site selection for the Broward arena is April 9th April 9th for the Broward arena site selection

[01:26:35.180 --> 01:26:35.980]
Thank you so much

[01:26:35.980 --> 01:26:39.900]
Which sounds like a week from the day we can pee in our pants and have another party again next Tuesday

[01:26:39.900 --> 01:26:45.240]
