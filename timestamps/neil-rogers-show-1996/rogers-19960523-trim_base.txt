We are all the people, who are out there giving, just a make-o-wimbing.

[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.360]
I would like to explain it to Robert.

[00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:14.780]
Let's have a dot.

[00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.600]
And we're out there giving, just a make-o-wimbing.

[00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:23.740]
Oh, God!

[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.240]
Okay, 10-0-8 at WIOD.

[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.360]
It's a great day for the Irish and the Jewish, and everybody else.

[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.900]
I'll tell you that.

[00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.380]
God, I haven't felt this good in years.

[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:33.460]
Isn't that amazing?

[00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.120]
You think it's just like now that the weight of all of that is off of our shoulders,

[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.000]
or is it even something beyond that?

[00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.980]
I think it's more something beyond that if he asks me, but I don't want to get too graphic

[00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:45.220]
and in detail about that, at least till September.

[00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.300]
So anyway, if anybody's got any questions for us.

[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:56.000]
If anybody wants to know what the latest rumor is there, I've got to really laugh about some

[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.020]
of the people in this town, especially the media people, and they're trying to get a hold of

[00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:01.300]
this one and get statements from that.

[00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:05.080]
One in the course, many of us are not returning a lot of these calls, because what's the point?

[00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.620]
So they're just listening to the radio, is, hey, good morning to all you guys.

[00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:11.080]
And then they're writing articles about it.

[00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:12.600]
How you doing, Tom Jicke?

[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.000]
Tom's okay. He's all right.

[00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:17.060]
He's just a little, and you notice how he had to get Hank's name in there again today?

[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.020]
I mean, what the hell did Hank have to do with any of this?

[00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.460]
But somehow he got, he worked Hank's name in there.

[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.100]
And Melissa, she had to work David Ross's name in there because

[00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:27.000]
Super David would have been upset if she didn't.

[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:31.540]
So, you know, there's always something to read between the lines and these articles.

[00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:37.540]
So anyway, what do we say about, now yesterday, at about, what time were they here from

[00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:40.940]
Channel 4? And by the way, thanks to them, they did a really nice piece. Did you see it on

[00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:41.900]
the five or six o'clock?

[00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:43.100]
No, at 5.30?

[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.040]
How they did a nice job.

[00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:48.260]
But in fact, even Camberl cracked up there a little bit.

[00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:50.380]
He had that lip curled up in here, that big one.

[00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:52.640]
And he kind of was amused.

[00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:55.480]
But anyway, we thank them profusely for that.

[00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.660]
But it threw me for a loop when they come in here and they're asking me about,

[00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:01.340]
well, what about Phil Henry leaving and what about here in Summersness and that.

[00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:05.180]
And here we had just had that meeting yesterday morning and we're like sworn to secrecy

[00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:09.380]
and we're going to keep this under wraps, which of course you would assume that was going to be the case.

[00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:13.400]
Because you don't want to have somebody on the year as a lame duck for like three months

[00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:17.020]
and everybody calling in every day, oh geez, you're leaving. What are we going to do?

[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:18.220]
Are you sure?

[00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:22.280]
So I don't know what to tell to say.

[00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:25.080]
So I just said, well, we're sworn to secrecy and we can.

[00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:27.960]
So nobody can blame us here on the year for spilling the beans,

[00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:29.480]
but everybody else evidently did.

[00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:34.360]
And you know, it's sad because Phil is a great talent and sometimes full of crap,

[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:35.340]
but that's the way we all are.

[00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:39.180]
But I don't know what the hell we're going to be doing there for three or four months

[00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:43.300]
or however long this takes because it's kind of a strange kind of a twisted

[00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:45.940]
Do you know what? Don't you find it? Or am I wrong?

[00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:48.580]
And then we're going to be in here for months.

[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:53.640]
That part is going to be really, that's going to be a really dicey situation because we're going to be,

[00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:58.740]
I mentioned this yesterday, the sale should go through like the end of August to the beginning of September.

[00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:02.400]
But we will still be in this building with the Cox people.

[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.940]
People are going to stop talking every time we walk into the room.

[00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:06.440]
Yeah.

[00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:08.800]
Cox by, look out.

[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:15.000]
So there will be a Paxon owned station in the midst of the Cox complex here.

[00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:17.500]
And then of course, they're building the thing up in Hollywood,

[00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:22.420]
which if they live long enough, the coast and hot 105 and there are other acquired properties,

[00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:25.480]
which I'm sure there will be some more will be in there, not AM.

[00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:31.300]
And we'll all be moving up to 441 and I want to say Miami Gardens Drive.

[00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:32.480]
Is that right? Is that what he said?

[00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:32.700]
1.91.

[00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:34.940]
Well, that's, yeah, that's about that.

[00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:40.060]
Close to the county line, but 441 and much, much closer to where most of us live in a brand new

[00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:43.940]
beautiful state of the art building with state of the art digital equipment and sounds pretty damn good.

[00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:47.080]
And from hearing from some of the people over there in that complex,

[00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:52.440]
they've got some pretty damn swanky equipment already now because I guess they believe in that.

[00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:55.820]
And of course, there are those people saying, well, how are you going to be able to work for

[00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:58.140]
Buddy Bud Pax and you ripped them for years? Well, that's true.

[00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:03.140]
Of course, I ripped the Cox people for years when I was over at INZ in the Zeta and Mike Disney

[00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:05.980]
in specific and then all of a sudden you wind up working over here.

[00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:07.440]
You see, that's the way the world is.

[00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:13.240]
It makes for strange bedfellows as they say, which brings me to this facts from a David Gravy line.

[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.440]
Congratulations, Neil. Welcome to the Pax and family.

[00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:18.560]
You're in bed with a bunch of us now.

[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:21.320]
Welcome to the free, David Gravy line. How do you like that?

[00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:23.220]
I don't want to be in bed with David Gravy line.

[00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:26.920]
Now Brian the board, I'll call it in yesterday. That's another story we can discuss that.

[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:31.340]
But David Gravy line, I don't think so as in no way.

[00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:35.800]
But nice thing, yeah, they're all like it's like we feel connected to them.

[00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:38.920]
Don't we? Don't you all of a sudden feel a little bit connected to at least some of them,

[00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:43.460]
some of the Pax and people now? And we feel very disconnected from the Cox people.

[00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:47.340]
In fact, I walked in that door this morning and there were some of the Cox folks who like

[00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:49.640]
look at you out of the corner of their alley. Oh, there he is again.

[00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:55.700]
And we definitely do. I know that I speak for a Rick and for SUDs and for anybody else who's

[00:08:55.700 --> 00:09:01.100]
going to be moving over to the Pax inside. We do want to apologize to all of the Cox people for

[00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:05.780]
costing them so much money these past at least in my case seven and a half years and preventing

[00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:11.700]
them from making a nice healthy profit and not getting those numbers and getting the whatever it

[00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:15.920]
is that we were supposed to get. I really I feel bad. I feel insufficient after that speech by

[00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:19.260]
Bob Niole yesterday morning. I feel somehow I've let I've let my leaders down.

[00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:23.420]
And I know that somewhere long line I'll have to repent and make good for that.

[00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:28.380]
1013. Don't isn't that with the way it was it just me because I know the other people I've

[00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:33.100]
spoken to had the same feeling yesterday. He kind of like in that speech. All he really had to do was

[00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:38.680]
say, you know, it's not been a financial winner for us and we're basically moving our direction and

[00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:42.520]
we're selling to Paxson and good luck to all of you and you'll find out what to start.

[00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:45.660]
What isn't that what would have been necessary? That's all I need to have been said.

[00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:49.720]
But it was kind of presented in the matter as if well, you know, we tried everything under the

[00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:52.680]
sun. We haven't been able to make money with this turkey and you people have been like a bird

[00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:57.020]
on us. So all you weigh in people like that. You know, that's kind of the feeling that I got.

[00:09:57.020 --> 00:10:04.120]
I felt like unclean. I kept smelling my shoes. 1013 at W I O D. It's Memorial Day madness of

[00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:08.440]
Kendall Toyota. Kendall Toyas management has gone nuts and authorized the release of the lowest

[00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:13.340]
Memorial Day sale prices ever. And when they say the lowest, they're not talking through their

[00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:19.100]
butt. They mean it. Listen to this. The new 96 yourself starting at just 8991. New 96 Corolla

[00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:27.000]
starting at just 10,991. New 96 Camry starting at just 13,991 and new Tacoma starting at 10,500.

[00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:31.820]
91 bucks. So what are you waiting for? Get down to Kendall Toyota before the management wakes up and

[00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:36.880]
realizes they're practically giving these new Toyota's away. It's no hassle, no negotiating or

[00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:41.040]
price shopping because they got one price selling. And your old car is worth $4,000 toward the

[00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:12.620]
The world of sports. According to DFO, www.wiod.com. Worldwide, baby. From news, talk and entertainment

[00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:20.360]
radio. 610 WIOD. 1017 and WID will want to find out about mission impossible. We'd like to save

[00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:23.400]
the audience some money or give them reason to go out and spend it. You know, you can read those

[00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:29.240]
reviews in the newspaper. And you know, sometimes they're on target, sometimes they're full of crap.

[00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:33.360]
And again, who the hell are they to be, you know, they're getting paid just for giving their opinion.

[00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:36.560]
God, I sure hate to be in that position, getting paid for giving my opinion.

[00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:41.060]
But anyway, so what the hell do those movie reviewers know? So we'll find out from some people who

[00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:44.980]
have seen it already, which I'm sure there are many. They were just flocking because the hype is

[00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:48.840]
just incredible. I mean, it is just supposed to be. And the things that I read about it was like it

[00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:53.660]
was okay. And the special effects were great. And Tom Cruise looked pretty good for him. But other

[00:11:53.660 --> 00:12:00.100]
than that, who knows, we'll find out. I mean, it was no seven. Here's our first call of the day.

[00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:03.880]
This is going to be a momentous day for us. Make no mistake about that. By the way, I'm sure that

[00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:08.280]
they a whole reneary crowd are listing this morning. I turned over to them just in time to hear

[00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:12.800]
Mikey say this morning, I'm getting a little tired of that crap. I can tell you right now. And

[00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:16.900]
also say that the fullest thing with Cox enterprises, which means he must have some real interesting

[00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:23.840]
pictures. Here's Boca. Hello. Neil. Yes, sir. Yeah, I want to read an article that Joly Point

[00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:28.980]
wrote on the New York Times, so that he's a national hockey writer. Yes, sir. He says, he's

[00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:34.480]
unbelievable. The last paragraph he says, as for the Eastern Conference Finals, sports faces

[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:39.960]
a crisis, the possibility that the pants, there's could take their sleep inducing act into the finals.

[00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:45.760]
Then he says, if the pants is one four or seven games, the leaks either demand a recount or

[00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:50.880]
amended spy loss, who extend this round to the best nine or best of 11. Whatever it takes to get

[00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:55.560]
the pay went for the finals. This guy would be shot. The last one, the pants and style of play

[00:12:55.560 --> 00:13:01.320]
could devastate the television ratings of Fox Network and ESPN. Imagine the possibility

[00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:06.940]
of the Stanley Cup presented South Florida on a steamy night during the week of summer solstice

[00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:11.720]
as fans lit of the ice with rats. At least real flying often puts our traditional, but not

[00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:17.860]
plastic, plastic rats is nothing sacred. Do you believe a guy who's the national writer of the

[00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:21.580]
New York Times right now? Oh, absolutely, because he's a pseudo intellectual. What does he know?

[00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:25.440]
How about the New York Times and the New Jersey Devils who are right there on their doorstep?

[00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:29.620]
It will are 10 times. Last year, there were 100 times more boring than will ever be.

[00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:33.700]
And how about the Detroit Red Wings who are a thousand times more boring than either one of them?

[00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:38.940]
I can't see him right underneath. There was an article Florida now, a hockey property where it says

[00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:43.180]
what a great job Torp, no Tori. There you go. But I mean, I can't, this is unbelievable.

[00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:47.660]
I don't pay any attention to that. It's just a bunch of spoiled sports. They don't have any New York

[00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:51.780]
team or New York area team that's got a shot at being in it. So right away they got to rip everybody

[00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:59.700]
else, screw them. Well, the people that really know like the CBC people, they're giving us the

[00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:02.940]
credit that we deserve. They really know the game. They really know what it's all about. And all

[00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:07.780]
these people think that somebody owes it to them to create a marquee matchup so that Fox and ESPN

[00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:11.420]
can get higher ratings. Fox ought to be worrying about their own god damn backyard and that's

[00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:15.480]
stupid Fox talks. And what they've done to try to destroy the game instead of blaming everybody else.

[00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:19.660]
All right. Have a good day. Just remember one thing Fox rhymes with Cox. You're right. Have a good day.

[00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:25.040]
And have back to you. That's depressing. But you know something we don't care because we know

[00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:28.960]
how good this team is. We know how many good exciting players we got on air. We know how many

[00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:34.260]
hardworking guys we got and we're savoring it. Yesterday I heard from several people.

[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.380]
Panther practice yesterday. You couldn't get near there. You couldn't find a parking space.

[00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:44.580]
The place was Jan with people. Everybody in their brother. The Stanley Cup here on the front of

[00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:49.300]
the sports section in the scum Sentinel. Here's a big picture of the Stanley Cup on display at JC

[00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:54.020]
pennies. Here's the guy. This plunket guy that travels around from the hockey all the fame in Toronto

[00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:57.800]
and travels around with a cup all over the damn place, which is why he got divorced because he's

[00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:03.640]
never home. He's busy with his cup all the time. And here's Adam Simpson of sunrise. This kid with

[00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:08.640]
his toy rat and he's got the cup sitting next to him. I mean, they've got the fever here man.

[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.780]
And if these other people think they're going to PR parade, well, scored, scored back at him. You know

[00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:20.620]
what I'm saying? Scrum. We have an open line in date. 7519463 751 W I O D the green lines in Palm Beach.

[00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:25.060]
Now what did Buddy Bud say yesterday about the green lines? Once he'd have no more. Yeah, I think he

[00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:29.560]
said you Palm Beach people to you. I think he's waiting. Does he own any properties up in Palm Beach

[00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:34.620]
County? I don't think so. He's got him all over Florida. I shouldn't say that. I'm not sure,

[00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:39.720]
but I have my doubts. Also, the article in the Harold, which I don't get the year old. So I hadn't

[00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:44.080]
read this until I got here. I didn't actually read in the business section Larry Lee Boots and

[00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:49.180]
Melissa Ruggieri's column packs and caps radio lineup with W I O D and Tom Jicca, who I have an

[00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:53.740]
Ellie went out and bought a new radio because he hasn't read anything about radio and ages. W I O D I O D

[00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:58.480]
deal could shuffle programming, which Tom, it's okay, but it's a lot of assumptions like most of us

[00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:04.080]
are making. And then I come in here and I read this Harold article, which is written by whom.

[00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:08.920]
This is also in a business section written by Mimi Whitfield, whatever name is,

[00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:14.080]
Paxiable by W I O D and three stations in Panama City. And it goes on to say here in the

[00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:20.480]
thing about W I O D about most people will be staying and the Paxi wants to keep the dolphins and

[00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:25.640]
Cox insisted on keeping afternoon talk show host Phil Henry as part of the deal. Henry who occupies

[00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:29.240]
the two to six PM slot remain on I O D, at least to August, but then reassigned to another Cox

[00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:36.380]
station. And then it goes on to talk about some of the rest of us. It says Paxi said there are

[00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:42.600]
excellent broadcasters and programmers at W I O D, although he questioned whether the language,

[00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:48.140]
some of the muses appropriate for radio, asked of his concerns, extended talk show host Neil Rodgers,

[00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:53.700]
known for his colorful language and insults. Paxi said, I'll leave that up to Neil. Neil is a great

[00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:59.500]
broadcaster. Neil God. How do you like that? What did I tell you about this buddy, buddy? Hello,

[00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:07.260]
a guy, man. He's the best. See, it's interesting. I'm sure that they thought that some people within

[00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:13.780]
the Cox enterprises, a chain of, a chain of command thought that, well, once we found out what this

[00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:18.100]
was going to be all about and especially me going to work for buddy, but that we would be like puking

[00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:23.140]
our guts out. And instead, now that we've had time to digest it and go to the track and win a few

[00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:29.020]
bucks last night, Michelle Brainer, God. And cash a few tickets and come back in and really think

[00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:33.000]
about it and talk to some people who are like objective and knowledgeable and understand just to

[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:38.000]
that that we're actually worthwhile human beings and we are not some kind of, you know, it's kind of

[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.720]
like we're a drag on their on their profit margin. You know, like we were we were bringing at corporate

[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:47.460]
profit level down. We were weighing them down and they just couldn't wait to cut us loose. Well,

[00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:53.120]
hey, have a great life, Bob Neil. And thanks for putting us on here in Tampa too. God, we could never

[00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:59.200]
have made it without that. 1023 at WIOD Liberty Gas Corporation wants to introduce you to the

[00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:03.860]
biggest advance in outdoor cooking since the Weber kettle. It's the Weber gas barbecue and it's

[00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:08.640]
like no other gas barbecue you've ever seen because it has the Weber flavorizer system that works

[00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:13.760]
without lava rock and virtually eliminates flare ups that can burn food. The Weber flavorizer

[00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:18.660]
system puts the heat exactly where you want it for the total cooking control you need. The Weber

[00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:23.360]
gas barbecues from Liberty Gas Corporation may clean up easy thanks to that removable tray that

[00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:27.800]
directs grease away from burners and with the Weber gas barbecues heavy duty construction they're

[00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:33.340]
built to withstand years and years of use and like I told you I use mine every single day of my life.

[00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:37.800]
Liberty gas has the full line of Weber gas grills. They've got over 40 grills on display starting

[00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:43.080]
at just 122 bucks and a huge selection of parts in stock too. Every grill is professionally assembled

[00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:46.760]
for your free charge and when you buy your grill you get a free tank of gas to get you started.

[00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:51.680]
You can also refill your tanks and they have a limited delivery area for you too. Liberty gas there is

[00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:56.740]
nothing like a Weber grill trust me like I said use it it's like my life. They're open Monday through

[00:18:56.740 --> 00:19:01.900]
Saturday 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sundays 9 to 2 you'll find Liberty gas in the blue building on the corner of

1029 at W IOD we got a couple open lines and date wait 97519463 751 W IOD. See the more that these

[00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:50.280]
other media outlets keep knocking the panthers and questioning our ability and calling us boring

[00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:54.960]
the more I enjoy it as we just keep going about our work and ignoring them and going about our

[00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:59.380]
pointed grounds and winning a few games here in air and making it really interesting which quite

[00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:05.100]
frankly we've won one more game in this round of the trea red wings which their third game is in

[00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:09.060]
Denver tonight and boy I got a feeling that they're going to go down big time the red wings tonight. I

[00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:13.860]
have a feeling they're going to go down without a whimper. Here is Fort Lauderdale on the purple line. Hello.

[00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:19.520]
Yeah Neil. Yes sir. I feel like an expectant father waiting for tomorrow to happen with regard to

[00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:25.220]
the panthers. Right. Tomorrow is a big day. The party begins tomorrow. Yes sir. Also with we got to

[00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:31.460]
the switch over to Paxon wasn't one day that wasn't you be thinking of buying the panthers at one time.

[00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:38.060]
Yeah and of course Wayne decided not to sell right. Right. For the time being but then again Wayne

[00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:43.780]
decided not to sell it to the guy from Dallas and now he says some of his local associates and people

[00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:48.100]
might be allowed to buy some of it and Paxon might be one of those. I don't know but I I know he's

[00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:53.300]
very very interested in it's I'm not giving any secrets. He's very interested in getting all of the

[00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:57.580]
sports franchises and I'm going to tell you there's going to be one battle for the dolphins and

[00:21:57.580 --> 00:22:01.260]
the marlins and the panthers. He's already got the heat but for those other three is going to be you

[00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:06.080]
know. Yeah because the way the way it is circulating around is that he definitely wants an interest in

[00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:12.460]
the in sports down here and also which is big. He wants to you know turn WILD into a sports station

[00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:18.360]
and no I don't I don't think that's just a rumor and what was said yesterday is that that's not

[00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:23.840]
going to happen. But again who really knows you know. No that's true. Listen last night with Michelle

[00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:29.900]
Brainer just you go wide a wire. No Michelle Brainer warmed up a horse super slats last night in the

[00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:34.460]
ninth or tenth race like like Mac Lowell the greatest warm up I've ever seen in my life.

[00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:40.120]
Horse should have been about nine or ten to one opened up at even money went up to three to one

[00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:44.460]
and finally went off at five to one and she took a two-hole trip and got locked in I thought she

[00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:48.880]
was never going to get out and got out on the last turn and swung wide and came zooming down

[00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:55.240]
this stretch in one going away. Michelle God. Is there any as far as the drivers and things to

[00:22:55.240 --> 00:23:00.440]
pompe know is anybody there of notoriety I mean like that Wally and Kevin and things like that is

[00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:05.800]
right. Mark Auburn is still there and Terry Kurus still there and Bruce Rangers having a great

[00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:10.520]
summer meeting he's just the smoking. Bobby Reese is still there or did he? Well it's trying to

[00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:15.180]
say that Bobby Reaser is a driver of note. No my friend Earl must have paid you to make this call

[00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:20.320]
or you kidding me or what Bobby Reaser. No everybody year ago Bobby Reese had a good summer meeting two years

[00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:24.980]
ago two years ago before his glasses got thicker than a pop bottles. How about Rick Shaude is he

[00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:29.380]
hanging in there? Rick went in doubt to say hi to Rick Shaude and his sister up at the Meadows.

[00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:34.940]
Have a great day pal. You're killing me. Okay we have an open line in day 7519463 we have one on a

[00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:39.240]
purple line mobile one cell 18 T wireless. So what do you hear Andy? Now watch out let me just

[00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:43.660]
tell you George right now want to go public with this. Oh trust me. Be very careful with this one

[00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:49.800]
over here. Okay. There if I ever saw one who's like he's like a chameleon he's ready to change

[00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:53.820]
colors in just look at how red his face is right now. He's also in a very desperate situation and

[00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:57.840]
he's in a desperate situation because he's with the lame duck over there. In fact you see the look

[00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:02.460]
at the lame duck hanging right from the wall over there. That's the Cox system over here. That's

[00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:07.740]
the lame duck hanging right from the wall and he's on that Phil Henry show which Phil is still one

[00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:13.120]
of the Cox's do's or something like that but you know so so where what's your story? What are

[00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:18.900]
you going to be when you grow up huh? No we'll see what happens in other words he's remaining

[00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:25.740]
flexible so like I said tell him nothing okay just go just where Andy comes in go that's all

[00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:31.320]
speaking tongues and tell him nothing because he's one of those Cox people this is really

[00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:36.760]
isn't it when you come right down to it this is more intrigued than fish and impossible I'm telling

[00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:42.440]
you this is a very bizarre situation because we have these mortal enemy camps now in the same building

[00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:47.120]
and I know that I'm by the way every morning now go up there and get my mail would you please I'm

[00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:51.140]
not going up I'm I'm drawing an imaginary line when he bent it from the coast just came in and

[00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:55.040]
give me a big hug and a kiss and she's going to be desperate because we're the only ones that feeder

[00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:59.040]
about once every three months and keep her alive they'll have to get an IV in there to keep her going

[00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:04.840]
but I think right past the coast there that's as far as I'm going a little a production room up

[00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:10.200]
there whatever the hell we call it a little green room F2 or FU is that what they call that's as far

[00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:14.860]
as I'm going I'm drawing my imaginary line because I'm not going beyond there I hope Cheryl don't

[00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:19.780]
take it personally but it's not personal it's business I just not and maybe certainly we don't

[00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:23.640]
want to take part because we love Mabel Mabel is one of the great people in the building and she's

[00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:27.800]
not everybody's side she's just a nice person which of course is unusual and misjoint in this

[00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:32.780]
business here's Westchester hello how you doing now yes sir you know where I feel going to go in

[00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:37.440]
the market or is he going to stand Florida you're asking me like I know that well that's true

[00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:43.360]
I don't know and I don't know what he said on the area yesterday he just said he's leaving WOD

[00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:47.680]
which is true once the sale goes through but he's staying with Cox and they have you know they

[00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:51.760]
have other stations like in LA and Atlanta and around the kind of Orlando so I don't know

[00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:56.960]
you know let's hope let's hope he does good for himself he's he's a great talent he is

[00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:02.500]
and by the way I what's your address there I got a nice little poster of Felix that I want to

[00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:11.560]
send all right WOD Miami 33141 and put Neil up make sure you put Neil Rogers on the outside

[00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:19.680]
of the package and no Cox people touch this telling you and being as I've learned most of my

[00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:23.760]
most of my freeloading from you is there any way I can get like a rat in return

[00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:29.400]
here's a guy who's anticipating the rats that we haven't even got yet what when do we get what's

[00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:04.220]
a way and of course then they got the thing with Brian Cox so I guess they might call that the Cox

[00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:11.720]
fights which is something like what they're doing the highly but with different well 7519463

[00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:19.300]
WOD see that's what's going on there that's what's going on with these day lines we got line

[00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:24.260]
checkers over there we got people asking around with our lines it must be so it must be a subterfuge

[00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:28.740]
and don't forget every time a line gets screwed up now between now in September we're going to run

[00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:33.500]

anybody lifting a finger without one single word without a TV spot without a billboard without a

[00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:34.360]
newspaper a without a guy with a sandwich board running up and down Lincoln road mall saying hey

[00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:25.080]
instead of but you don't have to spend that much but you obviously got the real good one and

[00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:28.600]
that's a way to go i think mine was about three eighty something but boy it's a good one if

[00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:32.460]
beats the spending is born in a change of the cheap one i got to three every two years

[00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:55.540]

[00:46:55.540 --> 00:46:59.900]
and he's going to work for them at some other place and he's not part of this deal i yeah really uh

[00:46:59.900 --> 00:47:04.380]
that's all i can tell you the article says that cox insisted on retaining his contract

[00:47:04.380 --> 00:47:10.980]
yeah now yesterday that's what it says that Hank sidekick was ripping you but what do i care about

[00:47:10.980 --> 00:47:16.840]

[00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:28.740]
soliciting phone calls he wanted this guy to get his own show oh my god can you believe it

[00:47:28.740 --> 00:47:33.580]

but i was just looking on there to see if i can then i'll encourage people to know that

[00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:14.080]
that's on there so they might buy this stupid that i mean it's great cd

[00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:18.040]
we have an open line on a green line 18944

[00:48:18.040 --> 00:48:23.200]

[00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:26.800]

[00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:44.080]
one we like it okay just spell out right like i said and like buddy bud paxon says my good close

[00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:49.280]
personal friend the lord only knows he says nil is a great broadcaster and i don't want to be

[00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:56.320]
one to disagree with my new boss it's 1124 at w-i-o-d news talk at entertainment radio

[00:48:57.220 --> 00:49:04.580]
610 w-i-o-d which isn't right now so anyway it's 1128 at w-i-o-d we have an open line on a green line so

[00:49:04.580 --> 00:49:08.080]
when looking for that damn the bible says that we put that on one of our best of

[00:49:08.940 --> 00:49:13.040]
because it's not in the dcs i'm gonna have to find a card and it's on bokeh brides thing but

[00:49:13.040 --> 00:49:16.920]
unfortunately his this bit he gave me won't play in this one cd deck it'll play in all the other

[00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:23.500]
ones in the building it won't play in here what did i tell you unbelievable here's a mobile in my

[00:49:23.500 --> 00:49:27.960]
Emmy hello hello yes sir hey nil good morning it was first thing the reason that uh

[00:49:27.960 --> 00:49:32.160]
Hank Goldberg talks about you is because he doesn't have anything else to say because he's obsessed

[00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:38.360]
about me he's like uh... you know he's a bore yeah let's face back pretty much you know when

[00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:42.240]
the only thing exciting in sports locally that's going on is the panthers you know nothing about it

[00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:45.940]
i guess that leaves you with limited material that's true it was the thing i was curious about i

[00:49:45.940 --> 00:49:49.160]
know that you don't uh... you know have any of the business decisions in this whole thing

[00:49:49.160 --> 00:49:54.320]
but are you personally disappointed if uh... fill Henry is lost because i think the guy's brilliant i

[00:49:54.320 --> 00:49:58.380]
mean i just i'm just really sad that you know that we might lose him here well what do you mean

[00:49:58.380 --> 00:50:01.880]
that we might lose him i mean if they send him to some other station else for me that the

[00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:06.280]
thing in the paper made it sound like he's out of town that he's gonna be sent out of town unless

[00:50:06.280 --> 00:50:10.960]
of course caused by some other station in town like an fm and they put him on air that's a possibility

[00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:16.220]
i think it's too bad because i i think you guys you know really dovetail well let you know nobody's

[00:50:16.220 --> 00:50:19.980]
been a bigger booster of film Henry that's because he's a great talent and he's a genius and he's

[00:50:19.980 --> 00:50:24.740]
incredible but let me give you an idea this puts Greg from point and beach is a chronic uh... human being

[00:50:24.740 --> 00:50:30.160]
and just and i'm being generous and saying that he says you must not be as powerful as you think you

[00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:34.600]
are i'm very disappointed that you didn't demand that fill Henry be part of the package when

[00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:39.300]
packed in bought you guys and he goes on the idea but i mean what kind of an idiot is this kid

[00:50:39.300 --> 00:50:44.560]
like i have something to do with the negotiations like i knew what was going on here like i had something

[00:50:44.560 --> 00:50:49.100]
to say about anything clearly he doesn't know how business works out oh my god talk about a

[00:50:49.100 --> 00:50:53.640]
puts like i'm going to sit and demand this and demand that well i'm saying what do you think

[00:50:53.640 --> 00:50:57.680]
it's a done deal they do these things behind closed doors and then we find about it after the fact

[00:50:57.680 --> 00:51:01.880]
this kid better grow up and come out of the real world that's the way it works what do you think

giving us an opportunity to find some audience out there you i just don't know what these people

[00:51:30.020 --> 00:51:34.220]

here's corals brings hello a new i got your mission impossible review

[00:52:43.660 --> 00:52:48.600]
okay but they only took me an hour and a half i've been on the line for an hour it was terrible

[00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:53.380]
it was the worst movie i've seen in such a long time are you cereal oh there was no

[00:52:53.380 --> 00:52:59.060]
but the plot was just cut in half somewhere they were in every other country next time you turn around

[00:52:59.060 --> 00:53:03.700]
there in one day and then there in the u.s and there in check with the vogue and there's like six

[00:53:03.700 --> 00:53:08.100]
double agents in the film and it's just impossible to follow it was the worst movie

[00:53:09.620 --> 00:53:13.600]
don't spend your money yeah i think the one paper gave it two stars or two and a half

[00:53:13.600 --> 00:53:16.120]
well some of the other one gave it three huh

[00:53:16.120 --> 00:53:21.060]
some set no gave it three yeah and they say the same thing i said there's no plot but for some reason they

[00:53:21.060 --> 00:53:24.380]
like it and it wasn't there wasn't even a lot of special effects or

[00:53:24.380 --> 00:53:28.300]
