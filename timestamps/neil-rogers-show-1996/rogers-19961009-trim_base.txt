[00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:04.140]
Music

[00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.640]
Mod from the all-new all-digital Hollywood studio.

[00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.600]
610 W.I.O.D. presents the Neil Rogers Show.

[00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.880]
This is on today's call, 622 W.I.O.D. a day.

[00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.280]
767 W.I.O.D. in Rower.

[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.140]
Soul 3888-949 W.I.O.D.

[00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.780]
An 18C wireless and world-of-one customers can call Soul 3 at Pound I.O.D.

[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.800]
Now, the Neil Rogers Show.

[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.240]
Hi, this is Sonny Fox and I listen to Neil Rogers because I can hear the word asshole.

[00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.980]
Boy, when this quarterback gets lonely,

[00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.160]
she likes receivers that are wise.

[00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.320]
Some people say that number 8 is gay.

[00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.980]
They say Troy loves the big brown eye,

[00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.360]
Ackman.

[00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.780]
Brackdom.

[00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.520]
He goes down on his knees and he's a man.

[00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.660]
His guy's he likes to please Ackman.

[00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.660]
He loves to slap cowboys on their behind.

[00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.880]
He's got a spotless reputation.

[00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.820]
America's team is world renowned.

[00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.680]
But is Troy gay?

[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.440]
I've heard some people say

[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:49.040]
In the heart he goes down Ackman.

[00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.440]
He goes down on his knees and he's a man.

[00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.720]
I can't some balls to squeeze Ackman.

[00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:06.380]
Don't clip him cause he likes it from behind.

[00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.500]
Brackdom.

[00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.060]
I can't believe it.

[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.960]
It's like we've been here all our lives.

[00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.640]
We're in our brand new state of the art studios.

[00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.040]
We're out of that dump.

[00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.640]
We're out of 79th Street.

[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.400]
We're out of date county and all we can say is.

[00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:27.960]
Oh my god.

[00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.140]
We forgot a gigantic studio audience.

[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.360]
I'm going to do it for Alex Bennett.

[00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.740]
It might work out okay for me.

[00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:34.640]
Let me ask you something.

[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.000]
Is this sound okay in there?

[00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.160]
It sounds sensational.

[00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:40.240]
Better than ever.

[00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.680]
It sounds too good to be you.

[00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:43.820]
Did we get screwed last night?

[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.120]

[00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.580]
What is that?

[00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.080]
How do they know what the numbers are?

[00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:52.580]
Did they give the number?

[00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:54.080]
It's on the open.

[00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.500]
It's on the open.

[00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.760]
Jesus.

[00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:58.960]
It's on the open.

[00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.240]
I thought maybe these people were smart.

[00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.780]
Who's going to be our first caller in our new studio's man?

[00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:06.500]
Who's going to be our first caller?

[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.040]
I bet to the Paxon people know what big shooters they are.

[00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.520]
Probably give like a million dollars.

[00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:13.820]
To the first caller.

[00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.160]
And like two million of the first caller in Broward.

[00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.740]
And ten million of the first caller in Palm Beach.

[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.180]
Okay, this is an exciting moment, ain't it?

[00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:27.720]
W-I-O-D.

[00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.540]
Feel.

[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:29.040]
Yes.

[00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:30.980]
Boy, I hope you're right about that.

[00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:32.340]
Cash.

[00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.980]
I need cash.

[00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.580]
How are you?

[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:35.700]
We'll send you over little sack.

[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:36.460]
All right.

[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:37.220]
This is Bill.

[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:38.100]
Last year I don't know.

[00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.120]
Bill, you don't sound very excited, but you're our first caller in our new studio.

[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.320]
I am excited for you.

[00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.660]
If you could be in here and see this is like a palace, you could eat off the floor.

[00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.840]
But the engineering staff says don't even think about trying it.

[00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.840]
It is amazing.

[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.320]
Neil, you've never dropped any food in your life.

[00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:53.680]
Yeah.

[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.640]
I've dropped a few times.

[00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:56.360]
This is Bill.

[00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.380]
I dropped off some Panther tickets for you last year to give away,

[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.380]
because I ate it from to go to waste when I couldn't make a couple of those games.

[00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.820]
Yeah.

[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:09.480]
So I'm a Panther fan and boy, oh boy, Rimmer did a great job on commentary last night.

[00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:10.680]
For him, yeah, was pretty good.

[00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:11.720]
We got screwed, though.

[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.600]
I see my asses all I can say.

[00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.420]
Leave it to that Pierre Rascal.

[00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.060]
Leave it to a frog this ticket to us.

[00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:18.660]
A frog in a backstabbing Russian.

[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.540]
Kovalev, who picked up his skate and let the puck go by.

[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.960]
There was, I was screaming when the lion's been put his hand up in the air to call the icing.

[00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:26.380]
I said, there's no icing there.

[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.060]
You just knew they were taking it away from us.

[00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:30.200]
We was robbed, man.

[00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:31.040]
But you know something.

[00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:32.140]
We'll still take the tie.

[00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.340]
Bill.

[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:36.000]
Bill.

[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.100]
I think we just lost Bill.

[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.080]
That was a beautiful thing.

[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.260]
Did you patch your round and there was Bill or just a...

[00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.700]
I didn't do it.

[00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:45.540]
He just expired.

[00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:46.340]
Nice going, Bill.

[00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:47.200]
I'll have a great life.

[00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:48.640]
Whatever you had, I hope it was good.

[00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:49.440]
Good for you.

[00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:50.460]
W-I-O-D.

[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.580]
Yes, sir.

[00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:52.520]
You guys sound great.

[00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:53.140]
Yeah, we do.

[00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.100]
How were the fans' behavior in 106 last night?

[00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.940]
I was only going to spend probably like an hour and a half, two hours on that.

[00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.520]
Oh, no.

[00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:00.640]
The first...

[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:02.460]
The first period, I gave him an A-plus.

[00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:03.580]
I told all the guys there.

[00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:04.460]
You've been spectacular.

[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.420]
I'm going to redeem you guys on the air tomorrow.

[00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:07.140]
You were great.

[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.640]
The second period, I would give him like a B.

[00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:10.140]
Okay?

[00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:11.280]
The second period was okay.

[00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:12.180]
They started to get...

[00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.600]
Their attention span is a little on the short side.

[00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:15.700]
They can use like some toys.

[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:17.020]
Do you know what I'm saying?

[00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:17.360]
Yeah.

[00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:20.540]
And the third period, I would give him like a C-

[00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:24.220]
I'll be generous because I mean, here's a game where he had one nothing, right?

[00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:27.120]
Almost the whole game, like from the end of the first period, almost to the end of the game.

[00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:31.940]
And in the third period, after some of the guys, like two or three of them got on their 14th beer,

[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:35.220]
it started to get in just a little on the sloppy side.

[00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:35.840]
Do you know what I'm saying?

[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.540]
Oh, Lord.

[00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:37.360]
Wealth them in the shape.

[00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:38.880]
Little on the sloppy side.

[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.160]
And then my give high marks to our friend Adam, though, who sits right next to me

[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.180]
because he kept yanking these guys by the back of the shirt.

[00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:45.220]
Sit down, sit down.

[00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:46.800]
You know, he knew that they were under great scrutiny.

[00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:48.160]
And he was okay.

[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:48.920]
Nice job, Adam.

[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.400]
They didn't lean forward, did they?

[00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:51.120]
No, they did not.

[00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:51.520]
Good.

[00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:55.220]
A couple of them, I think, might be leaning backward, but that's after the 20 or 30th beer.

[00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:56.020]
It was okay.

[00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.220]
A good time was had by all the ceremonies were great.

[00:05:58.380 --> 00:05:58.920]
Did you see it?

[00:05:59.040 --> 00:05:59.460]
Yes, I did.

[00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.000]
What channel?

[00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:02.840]
Yeah, and they hit it on, right?

[00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:03.160]
Yes.

[00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:03.860]
All right.

[00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.960]
Hey, we're waiting here about Bobby Green and the Cox people.

[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.460]
Trust me, it only starts today.

[00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:12.200]
I got stories that'll last from now until what year is it?

[00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:13.800]
What century is it?

[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:14.560]
96.

[00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:15.760]
Okay, you'll hear it, pal.

[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:16.240]
All right, Neil.

[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:16.940]
Have a great day.

[00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:17.340]
You too.

[00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:18.360]
Okay, beautiful.

[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:22.320]
I got to get used to all this stuff because, uh, look at that.

[00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:23.820]
Now, let me ask you one question, though.

[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:25.820]
Let me ask you a question.

[00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:27.280]
Why is it like line 13?

[00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:28.900]
What is that?

[00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:30.500]
George.

[00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:30.980]
That's the mobile line.

[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.820]
We're working on the labeling and all that.

[00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:34.100]
That's the mobile line?

[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:35.260]
That's the pound line.

[00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:38.440]
Are you sure?

[00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:39.960]
Yeah, trust me.

[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:40.880]
I'm just taking him.

[00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:41.720]
Here's the purple line.

[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:42.000]
Hello.

[00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:43.240]
Yes.

[00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:45.100]
It does referee suck.

[00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:45.720]
Yeah, they do.

[00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:48.560]
And I'm backstabbing frog, Pierre Razzico.

[00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:53.000]
I mean, he even set it on the air last night that he's added in for the, uh, the panthers.

[00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:54.120]
The whole thing.

[00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:57.880]
Well, Mark Faw set the referee has had it in for us for a long time and he's stuck to join out.

[00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:02.120]
But the point is, when they blow a call like that and I just screwed it was apoplectic.

[00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:07.120]
But when he blow a call like that, usually when it's that obvious, the referee will overrule him

[00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:11.580]
and then they'll have the face off at center rice and they'll say we made a mistake and the face off goes to center rice.

[00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:13.260]
Instead, it goes into our end.

[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:19.260]
The only, you know, I never would second guess my good buddy Doug McLean except, except I'll make one exception in this moment.

[00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:23.420]
And that is if it would have been me at that point, I would have called my timeout.

[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:24.560]
They had the one timeout left.

[00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:27.280]
I would have calmed everybody down because the guys were apoplectic.

[00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:29.720]
They were very unprepared for that face off.

[00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:34.060]
We never got control of it and they just kept whacking away there in front of the net and they stuck it in.

[00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:35.280]
You're absolutely right.

[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:35.440]

[00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:36.340]
Absolutely right.

[00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:40.560]
If you would have just if Doug would have just looked across at it, given the high sound we'd have been alright.

[00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:44.320]
Right. Well, but then again McLean was apoplectic too about the whole thing.

[00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:46.060]
I mean, he was trying to get him to change the call.

[00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:46.560]
Yeah.

[00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:48.380]
Can he protest the game from that point on?

[00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:50.900]
He's not going to protest the game on an icing call.

[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:51.480]
You can't do that.

[00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:52.520]
Is that a judgment call?

[00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:52.800]
Yeah.

[00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:54.820]
Oh, okay. Because that's a shame.

[00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:56.400]
But I want to tell you one thing, though.

[00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:57.680]
Let me just say this.

[00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:58.760]
Glenn Healey last.

[00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:00.180]
I mean, Beeser played phenomenal.

[00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:02.260]
He was great and we get to expect that every night.

[00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:04.980]
But Glenn Healey played the game of his life for them last night.

[00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:09.620]
If Healey wouldn't have played that game last night, you wouldn't have had to worry about any icing call because we'd had six, seven goals.

[00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:10.560]
We'd have blown them out.

[00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:13.000]
If Richter would have started last night, we'd have blown their ass out.

[00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:14.460]
There's no question about Healey.

[00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:16.180]
He was in another world.

[00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:17.460]
Yeah. He really was.

[00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:19.220]
Breakaway after breakaway after.

[00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:23.400]
And then I hear these guys saying on radio, wow, you know, I guess the Ranger defense played pretty well.

[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:24.280]
What defense?

[00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:28.780]
How can you have like six, seven, eight breakaways in a game and say the defense was playing pretty good?

[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:29.260]
Exactly.

[00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:30.220]
You were listening on the radio?

[00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:31.540]
Not on the way home.

[00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:32.080]
Oh, okay.

[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:34.880]
This is in the post game analization when they were analyzing it.

[00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:36.020]
No, I wouldn't listen to them.

[00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:39.380]
But the TV was great that the ceremonies was fantastic.

[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:39.760]
Yeah.

[00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:41.120]
I was really, really super job.

[00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:43.240]
Really felt the sense of pride with that whole thing.

[00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:44.140]
Yeah, it was great.

[00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:45.640]
And let me also say this.

[00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:49.200]
Did you notice and did anybody comment after Fitzgerald scored our goal?

[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.680]
No rats on the ice.

[00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:54.180]
Not one, not a little teeny tiny one.

[00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:55.300]
It was a beautiful thing.

[00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:57.100]
You're right, except for the signs that said rats.

[00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:58.100]
That was great.

[00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.320]
That shows what class we got here.

[00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:00.460]

[00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:03.600]
I mean, during the opening ceremonies, there were like six rats thrown on the ice.

[00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:08.260]
I don't want to say the guy with a green shirt who sits in our section three seats to my right who drinks 80 beers a game.

[00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:12.100]
I don't want to say he was the one that threw three of those big rats on the ice, but I will anyway.

[00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:14.880]
So it goes to show you like only two or three bows those out there.

[00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:18.660]
Even during the ceremonies, we're so compelled with this that they had to do their rat number.

[00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:23.420]
They'll grow up and hopefully they'll butcher up like the rest of Panther fans or great fans.

[00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:25.740]
And they definitely deserve everything they get.

[00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:27.600]
I'll tell you last night was it.

[00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:31.120]
It was just like a playoff game last night.

[00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:32.600]
The atmosphere in there was electric.

[00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:33.900]
It was, you know, it was even better.

[00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:35.940]
The quality of play.

[00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:37.420]
The players were up to it too.

[00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:39.960]
I don't think there's any left out from the end of last year.

[00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:41.260]
I was afraid that there might be.

[00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:44.640]
But the plane has them in shape and they look like they're ready to go.

[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:45.080]
Amen.

[00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:46.360]
I'm looking forward to a great year.

[00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:47.980]
Maybe undefeated. Wouldn't that be nice?

[00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:50.840]
81.01. There you go.

[00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:52.780]
Wouldn't that be something? Sounds realistic to me.

[00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:54.920]
Good luck in a new place. Thanks for letting me in.

[00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:55.540]
Thanks a lot, pal.

[00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:58.120]
You're your first on the phone.

[00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:59.260]
You used to be the purple line.

[00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:00.980]
Yeah, are they color coded or not?

[00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.220]
Now it's going to be the green line for all of Paxton's money.

[00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:04.680]
Have a great day, pal.

[00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:05.360]
Thank you.

[00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:07.540]
See, the cox sisters got a lot of money too.

[00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:10.560]
In fact, they got $8 billion, which I'm sure Bud don't have no $8 billion.

[00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:12.680]
But the only difference is he spends his.

[00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:15.180]
For us, that's the big difference.

[00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:16.020]
We're looking around here.

[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:21.120]
We got more money invested just around me within a five foot radius of where I'm sitting.

[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:24.520]
Then the entire cox broadcasting chain probably has.

[00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:28.640]
And there are 1902 Marconi crap in that reject stuff that most stations will throw out.

[00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:30.040]
Not that we want to sound bitter.

[00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:34.040]
Do we? Do we want to sound a little bit on the bitter side?

[00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:35.360]
We don't want to start those stories yet.

[00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:37.660]
Do we? Do we want to start the stories now?

[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:38.140]
You go.

[00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:38.260]
Go ahead.

[00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:39.640]
Start now and let them in.

[00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:48.580]
And let them in.

[00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:48.580]

[00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:48.580]

[00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:48.720]
And let them in.

[00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:49.440]
And let them in.

[00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:50.360]
And let them in.

[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:51.460]
And let them in.

[00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:52.700]
And let them in.

[00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:54.920]
And let them in.

[00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:57.580]
And let them in.

[00:10:57.580 --> 00:10:58.040]
And let them in.

[00:10:58.180 --> 00:10:59.140]
And let them in.

[00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:00.840]
And let them in.

[00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:01.260]
And let them in.

[00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:01.260]

[00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:01.960]
And let them in.

[00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:01.960]

[00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:02.700]
And let them in.

[00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:03.380]
And let them in.

[00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:03.460]
And let them in.

[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:03.600]

[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:03.660]
And let them in.

[00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:03.900]
And let them in.

[00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:03.900]

[00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:04.580]
And let them in.

[00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:04.920]
And let them in.

[00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:06.640]
And let them in.

[00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:08.160]
And let them in.

[00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:08.640]
And let them in.

[00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:11.920]
And let them in.

[00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:13.840]
And that's everything he's got risk of.

[00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:15.020]
And he's got risk of-

[00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:15.020]

[00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:15.820]
And deway.

[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:38.800]

[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:38.800]

[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:38.800]

[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:38.800]

[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:41.940]
the Panthers are on the board and Lee one to number.

[00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:42.460]
Oh!

[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:45.880]
Not bad, Rimmer, not a bad job for you, pal.

[00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:49.680]
1014 at WIOD in our polatial New Hollywood studios.

[00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:52.200]
It's comfortable, it's beautiful, it's spacious,

[00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:54.600]
it's fantastic, the audience is on top of it.

[00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:57.340]
And we got stories that haven't been invented yet.

[00:11:57.420 --> 00:11:59.200]
We're going to revisit that game last night,

[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:00.620]
just to piss off the people away.

[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:02.360]
It hockey out there, it's going to be dynamite.

[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:04.920]
In the meantime, by the way, as soon as Roy leaves,

[00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:06.680]
we can light up our celebratory cigar too,

[00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:08.140]
because they know Max Mox cigar is the world,

[00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:09.420]
probably sneak one of those in here too.

[00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:11.420]
Are we, is there a big sign that says no smoking?

[00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:12.640]
I don't see any of those that say,

[00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:15.540]
via Tato Fumari, I don't see any of those on the wall.

[00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:17.520]
He'll be alright, he'll get used to that.

[00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:19.100]
In fact, we're a bunch of slabs, that's all right,

[00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:21.280]
but we bring into bucks, that's all they care about.

[00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:22.920]
If you love cigars, like, in fact,

[00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:25.160]
I noticed some of these clowns at the game last night,

[00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:26.600]
they were puffin' on it.

[00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:28.440]
And one or two of them had cigars too.

[00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:30.300]
In entertainment radio.

[00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:34.660]
16 WIOD.

[00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:36.600]
You call that a penis?

[00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:40.960]
It's new from these discount productions.

[00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:43.920]
Yes, potential car thieves, be on notice.

[00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:47.440]
You will now be thrown back from any car you try to steal

[00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:52.120]
with the piercing sound of the all-new Macarena Alarm.

[00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:54.280]
Oh my God.

[00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:58.940]
Yes, of Macarena Alarm.

[00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:00.940]
Get yours today.

[00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:01.060]
Hey!

[00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:09.260]
You're being very difficult with me this morning.

[00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:09.720]
Hey man.

[00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:11.080]
Ten-eighteen at WIOD.

[00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:11.980]
How's everything going, Mac?

[00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:12.540]
Everything's good.

[00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:14.000]
Here's got the phone paddies.

[00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:14.560]
A didlin' it.

[00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:15.860]
All these engineers gotta come in there,

[00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:17.460]
stick their finger in it, and the board too.

[00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:19.760]
It sounds pretty damn good to me, if you ask me.

[00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:23.620]
So anyway, we got screwed a little bit last night,

[00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:24.960]
but everybody had a great time.

[00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:27.340]
The town is finally on fire, hockey's underway again.

[00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:28.300]
And like I told you before,

[00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:31.460]
the fact that we got a mediocre or rebuilding year for the dolphins to make no

[00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:34.560]
mistake about it everything is going to be okay because the Panthers are

[00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:37.780]
going to fill that gap they're going to fill that oozing void that we've been

[00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:41.360]
so let me just get used to this thing up on the ceiling here okay the one

[00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:44.840]
it's like 85 feet away which thank God we got good eyesight here's plantation

[00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:15.100]
day to be a panther fan it's a great day to be alive it's a great day to be in in this radio

[00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:20.200]
station it's a great day to be a panther fan we're undefeated we're three and yeah when they

[00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:25.180]
raised that banner last night right did you get goosebumps in places I've never known I got

[00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:30.840]
chills in my rectum just watching the ceremony hey listen for years you've been cracking me up yeah

[00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:35.760]
and uh congratulations on the new move I hope how do let me ask you seriously how does this

[00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:40.300]
on a year and not on your phone how does it sound from here I don't know because I've been on hold

[00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:44.200]
since you started the show I know like I said let me ask somebody who knows okay yeah I'm

[00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:49.080]
curious about that because it just it feels like you're like in a real radio studio as opposed to

[00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:53.620]
in a broom closet well you you sound like you got a lot of piss and vinegar today mostly the first

[00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:57.080]
part yeah well that's all right and the bad part of it is even though the restroom is on the same

[00:19:57.080 --> 00:20:01.100]
floor it's about a mile and a half away we need the exercise hey one concern though about the

[00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:05.480]
panther what is that what's the problem with the power play we're only over 15 what are you

[00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:09.920]
complaining about little October yeah you're right what's the problem gotta get working on that

[00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:14.020]
power play although last night you know we had a lot of great chances he was unconscious and I

[00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:18.460]
thought we passed it around pretty good it just we couldn't stick it by him no I know it I hope

[00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:22.460]
it doesn't come back to come back to bite us yeah when you know even last year we had the great year

[00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:26.580]
but our power play for the most parts still stuck the joint out we still got to find a combination

[00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:31.080]
that make that power play work we got to do something on it well we got a lot of games left and

[00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:34.880]
we're doing a good job killing off the penalties too by the way we're doing a great job on that

[00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:39.740]
that worked well last night bees are a sharp is can be he was phenomenal again last night and I think

[00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:44.200]
he's just sitting to a groove and that's one area of the game we don't have to worry about at all

[00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:49.460]
he's phenomenal how would you rate bees are in the league in the top three no quite right now no

[00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:54.440]
question about it and even right now the way he's playing right now he is as good as anybody I mean

[00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:58.320]
he Lee the game you played last night you can't play a better game than that but you know one game

[00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:03.700]
doesn't make a career he Lee is okay like that you know he Lee is the little disgruntled because he

[00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:06.800]
knows that with Richter in there Richter's always going to be the starter and he Lee's going to

[00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:11.600]
just be spot started so he's disgruntled about that but at the same time he knows that he's on a

[00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:15.760]
team with a lot of you know a lot of talent they spent a lot of money on air and he's really best

[00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:19.460]
these last couple of years when he comes in and they spot him here in air and he can play a game

[00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:25.400]
like that yeah well anyway in closing I want to say Gretsky sucks yeah he didn't do much no he was

[00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:30.400]
danger he made a couple of nice passes he was dangerous a couple of times but generally speaking he

[00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:35.000]
wasn't much of a factor and like I said before without Messier that team is a shadow you're right

[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:39.560]
and even with him I don't think they're going anywhere well we saw what the what St. Louis paid him

[00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:45.120]
right exactly they had a struggle to get by the falling Leafs but anyway listen god bless the

[00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:50.180]
Panthers good luck in the new studio and have a great day and thank you so much all right but

[00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:55.040]
have a great life pal oh these people are so nice I feel seriously we could go Saturday

[00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:59.860]
now was that what when how was that was that the day it was like oh that's right that was when

[00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:04.340]
we thought we were finished and we had that one Monday in limbo for the Cox people but just

[00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:08.800]
psychologically I woke up that Saturday morning and I felt emancipated I felt like Martin

[00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:14.440]
Luther King and I felt free totally free and then of course we went through and we came back and at

[00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:18.620]
Monday we still for Cox and then we were in the realization that we still had to be in a building

[00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:23.280]
in other couple of days and then it turned out to be another day or two extra but this morning I

[00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:29.100]
woke up feeling like a new a child feeling like 20 years has been added in my life with all due

[00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:33.360]
respect to Bob Green and our good close personal friends over there who would never screw us although it

[00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:39.840]
is just a question of when right not a question of if it's just a question of when right just

[00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:47.300]
testing are you are you patching with my thing here yeah I think I did a pretty good job with

[00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:53.320]

[00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:12.100]
okay 1028 we got equipment in here I wished a whole audience which probably in our case in the

[00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:15.880]
way the way the Cox people have done to us we could probably get the whole audience in here right now

[00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:20.760]
at least on this day trust me what I tell you it's not important that they succeed but that we

[00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:27.000]
fail trust me what I tell you they couldn't happen Bob but have a great life midget 1028 at WYOD let me

[00:24:59.750 --> 00:25:03.650]
I was there for eight years and trust me what I tell you never at any time did they even make an

[00:25:03.650 --> 00:25:07.570]
attempt to pull it out when it down so we'll get into some of those stories as the week progresses

[00:25:07.570 --> 00:25:10.930]
into we'll tell you about Bob Green and what a good friend he was to me and how he was

[00:25:10.930 --> 00:25:15.250]
concerned about all of our welfare and about those last glorious weeks and months before the sale

[00:25:15.250 --> 00:25:19.530]
was announced back there in May on May 21st I believe it was when we're getting all those great

[00:25:19.530 --> 00:25:23.310]
certain we're going to FM and we're gonna have a swap and you're gonna be on this station and

[00:25:23.310 --> 00:25:28.270]
you guys are going to FM and yeah right but the bottom line I guess the whole thing is in spite of

[00:25:28.270 --> 00:25:31.210]
the fact that they were spreading all of those rumors and certainly not doing very much to

[00:25:31.210 --> 00:25:35.470]
quash them is that well we couldn't make any money with you guys you suck and we had to get

[00:25:35.470 --> 00:25:39.390]
ready and now life moves on and we're going to Syracuse and a place where we can really relate to

[00:29:07.890 --> 00:29:13.070]
last night everybody got to see it for free on 33 it was on sports channel they get it on the big

[00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:17.530]

[00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:38.650]
when is this if you could only see this man you wait never even Thomas Edison never dreamed

[00:29:38.650 --> 00:29:42.830]
anything like this well I've called you several times before you may remember I'm a pilot for

[00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:48.110]
major airline I'll trade you a tour of my high tech cockpit my 737 for a tour of your studio

[00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:52.650]
studio it's probably got more stuff than we have I wouldn't be surprised especially if it's value

[00:29:52.650 --> 00:30:01.850]
jet no thank god they don't have 737 yeah oh my god only 727s no they don't have DC 9s all nice

[00:30:01.850 --> 00:30:08.850]
radio thing beautiful but unfortunately I think we got beat by the rest last night but like you

[00:30:08.850 --> 00:30:12.590]
said he'll be played at outstanding game oh he was you know you got a hand to two I mean

[00:30:12.590 --> 00:30:17.690]
bezer played these are plates in satial he Lee played beyond that whatever the next stage is

[00:30:17.690 --> 00:30:23.110]
be I did just on real right if we can't score more goals with messy not being in there that's

[00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:27.530]
you know maybe we didn't deserve to win but no I think we played outstanding I mean the first two

[00:30:27.530 --> 00:30:31.170]
periods especially this is the thing that's heartbreaking you see it in sports all the time

[00:30:31.170 --> 00:30:36.070]
when one team outplays the other one by such a big margin early in the game and you can't put

[00:30:36.070 --> 00:30:40.030]
anything on the board it's like the dolphins how many times you know on Sunday I thought to myself

[00:30:40.030 --> 00:30:45.410]
here we go again we drive it right down the field spikes is running like crazy our running game is

[00:30:45.410 --> 00:30:49.250]
working and Erickson looked fine in that first drive and we get first and goal on the three

[00:30:49.250 --> 00:30:53.690]
hardline field goal again how many times have we seen that yeah if you if you're doing your thing

[00:30:53.690 --> 00:30:57.750]
early in the game and you can't put points or goals or whatever on the board you're going to wind

[00:30:57.750 --> 00:31:02.370]
up either blowing it and or you're losing it I was on a layover in Kansas City and the sports bar

[00:31:02.370 --> 00:31:07.150]
actually they have casinos in Kansas City believe it or not yeah on a ship watching the game like

[00:31:07.150 --> 00:31:12.330]
you don't have that here man we don't want these pacemakers given on places pack yeah

[00:31:12.330 --> 00:31:17.490]
and a little nowhere what a shock yeah people actually looking for a good time yeah and I was

[00:31:17.490 --> 00:31:22.770]
in drive my in my call at night 6.40 a.m. waiting for the pregame should have come on yeah and Hank

[00:31:22.770 --> 00:31:30.330]
is still on and oh am I glad you mentioned that fat slaw man I see your car was already yeah

[00:31:30.330 --> 00:31:35.730]
yeah he's all excited say all the excitement at the arena electricity and oh my god here comes

[00:31:35.730 --> 00:31:40.330]
the rats and then a few seconds later he says oh no those are the pucks coming up to the ice yeah

[00:31:40.330 --> 00:31:44.830]
he wouldn't know a rat he wouldn't know a rats ass from a puck I had several spirals reports on

[00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:48.070]
his performance yesterday first of all I have no idea why they send him over there because he

[00:31:48.070 --> 00:31:52.890]
doesn't know the game he hates being there he keeps you know he alternates between saying oh yeah

[00:31:52.890 --> 00:31:57.510]
these guys are all great from Tori and Wayne all the way on down all the players which is true but

[00:31:57.510 --> 00:32:02.890]
we already know that he alternates between that faked enthusiasm and saying well no wonder we got

[00:32:02.890 --> 00:32:07.490]
no calls you know come over here do a hockey game you know trying to do a show he doesn't like it he

[00:32:07.490 --> 00:32:11.450]
hates it he doesn't understand it knows nothing about it once they find somebody who knows a little

[00:32:11.450 --> 00:32:15.250]
something about it and get his fat ass out of there yeah and that's where you know in addition to

[00:32:15.250 --> 00:32:18.550]
which you know we had all these people get there early last night and he had been there since early

[00:32:18.550 --> 00:32:24.190]
in the afternoon they were already running short of food to the concession stands oh just because

[00:32:24.190 --> 00:32:28.890]
fatso was in there hey stop it well the papers this morning the players showed their usual class and

[00:32:28.890 --> 00:32:33.110]
said hey we'll take the point right that's right they're not crying they're not belly aching it was

[00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:36.810]
disappointing I mean you go down to inside the last minute of the game protecting the lead but

[00:32:36.810 --> 00:32:41.370]
uh... we'll take the point we'll take two oh and one in those first three games against teams like that

[00:32:41.370 --> 00:32:47.510]
that's right amen all right have a good day okay pal have a great life okay that's our fly-in friend

[00:32:47.510 --> 00:32:53.250]

that a man and a woman can't be friends without having sex but in your case i'll make an exception

welfare who would never stick me in the back who would never let me down etc takes me across the street

[00:34:57.630 --> 00:35:05.890]

[00:35:13.050 --> 00:35:17.950]
over to anica pri for a cheap meal and so we're sitting there and he lays all this crap out for me and

[00:35:17.950 --> 00:35:23.450]
the station is not being sold it's not for sale and yada yada yada and this and that all this other

[00:35:23.450 --> 00:35:27.590]
stuff none of it other than the only thing he told me that did come true in that meeting was we

[00:35:27.590 --> 00:35:33.370]
were getting rid of the traffic metro traffic and getting our own traffic people yeah they turned out

[00:35:33.370 --> 00:35:37.330]
to be great today the levels on these things by the way in this 360 whoever dubbed these things

[00:35:37.330 --> 00:35:43.130]
originally we need to put them in there again you know I'm saying as in really low are you all the way

[00:35:43.130 --> 00:35:47.510]
up it's as it's almost up as far as mine will get up okay that's as high as it gets trust me

[00:35:49.290 --> 00:35:55.110]
so anyway the station's not for sale then we have the meeting with Bob kneeled back on May 21st

[00:35:55.110 --> 00:35:59.590]
where he gets all the people from all three cock stations in across the street very close by the

[00:35:59.590 --> 00:36:03.190]
way that anica pri right next door to it and we're sitting in there and he gets up and makes this

[00:36:03.190 --> 00:36:07.850]
torpy little speech about wow you know we've tried everything for the last 10 years and since

[00:36:07.850 --> 00:36:11.550]
the mid 80s and we can't make any money with this turkey and basically you guys suck and now we're

[00:36:11.550 --> 00:36:15.790]
gonna let somebody else try to make some money with and come to find out he says well the

[00:36:15.790 --> 00:36:20.950]
negotiations with the paxon people have been going on now for on and off for at least the last year

[00:36:22.210 --> 00:36:26.790]
and based on reports we got from certain people inside who will go on name because we like some of

[00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:31.290]
them it was going on for at least a year maybe year and a half but the station wasn't for sale

[00:36:31.290 --> 00:36:35.910]
they would never lie to us and they would never screw us okay and by the way let's say a prayer

[00:36:35.910 --> 00:36:39.230]
or a meal okay let's say a prayer here's an article about paxon by the way Neil we just

[00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:42.550]
hold a station you're going to work for him we assigned your contract here's an article about paxon

[00:36:42.550 --> 00:36:46.930]
oh my god you're in big trouble now yeah we're in big trouble now mr hot shot

[00:36:48.250 --> 00:36:52.610]
like those vents baby remember that story with events that we were all choking and gagging

[00:36:52.610 --> 00:36:56.650]
well it's not economically feasible for us at this time to worry about that we can't yeah we can't

[00:36:56.670 --> 00:37:02.010]
do it so i had to get on here and have people call osha people were threatening to call osha the

[00:37:02.010 --> 00:37:06.550]
occupational safety hazard administration and come in here and practically close that joint down

[00:37:06.550 --> 00:37:09.990]
before we trade it out needless to say they couldn't come up with the cash out of the eight

[00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:14.050]
billion dollars traded out for very code and the AC people to come in here and clean that joint out

[00:37:14.050 --> 00:37:18.670]
which they took 50,000 tons of crap out of the vents out of that building probably which hadn't

[00:37:18.670 --> 00:37:24.590]
been cleaned since before Henry bearer was a baby I should really you know Bob Green always told

[00:37:24.590 --> 00:37:28.490]
me Neil you should write a book he should really write a book I should write a book and most of it

[00:37:28.490 --> 00:37:32.550]
would be about him I mean when Disney was there at least in the beginning we had our travails we had

[00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:36.870]
our problems we went through some crap but nothing like the last three or four years it was just

[00:37:36.870 --> 00:37:42.030]
beyond belief just go in there and make it happen okay just go in there and don't expect any promotion

[00:37:42.030 --> 00:37:46.590]
to expect it's about not expect the equipment to expect any maintenance but it was we're supposed

[00:37:46.590 --> 00:37:50.330]
to sit in there and just make something happen by ourselves which I guess most of us have a lot

[00:37:50.330 --> 00:37:56.830]
of experience here's Virginia key hello welcome and congratulations Uncle Neil thank you so much

[00:37:56.830 --> 00:38:02.370]
sir I am free at last pal you know when you're on hold that that last car was right your microphone

[00:38:02.370 --> 00:38:08.350]
sounds very static you're just sound fine but yours sounds something like something's not right with it

[00:38:08.350 --> 00:38:12.890]
yeah but anyway not on the ear though right you're on the ear but it's no no but on the ear it sounds

[00:38:12.890 --> 00:38:19.750]
great you sound perfect it sounds so much it sounds like like I hate I say FM really yeah sounds

[00:38:19.750 --> 00:38:23.230]
really really clear on especially on the phone I can't I don't think there's too many FM's got

[00:38:23.230 --> 00:38:26.790]
equipment like this I'll guarantee you that well you know congratulations and not you're

[00:38:26.790 --> 00:38:33.630]
definitely deserving of it at the talent of your caliber but I have to say yes I am hockey game

[00:38:33.630 --> 00:38:39.590]
was brilliant last night it was great to see it for free yeah what a concept my boss came in

[00:38:39.590 --> 00:38:44.250]
yesterday and and said hey it's baseball tonight and my buddy I work with and I look at each other

[00:38:44.250 --> 00:38:50.230]
we're like no hockey and he says quote oh you don't like baseball because you're an asshole oh really

[00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:54.390]
yeah what the hell what the hell does that mean I don't know like like baseball has even an

[00:38:54.390 --> 00:38:58.750]
Iota of excitement in it not only that but do you think there's any contest I mean I realized

[00:38:58.750 --> 00:39:02.470]
the baseball seasons over for the Marlins but even with Jim Leland being signed as the new manager

[00:39:02.470 --> 00:39:07.690]
you think there's any contest between the the interest level in this town right now even with

[00:39:07.690 --> 00:39:12.490]
the playoffs going on between the Panthers and baseball nobody here get nobody here gives a

[00:39:12.490 --> 00:39:18.870]
flying crap about baseball Marlins what right exactly exactly and the answer is suck I think is the

[00:39:18.870 --> 00:39:22.810]
uh word you're looking for any he couldn't run the bases this guy could not run the bases if

[00:39:22.810 --> 00:39:26.490]
his life depended on it yeah that's the other funny thing about these baseball guys there's a lot

[00:39:26.490 --> 00:39:31.850]
of them that I see they're just you know they just they couldn't even go run the freaking bases yeah

[00:39:32.370 --> 00:39:38.030]
so anyway just wanted to say congratulations and and and keep up the good work your new station you

[00:39:38.030 --> 00:39:42.350]
found a lot happier is probably better for your house you haven't got any idea not only that you

[00:43:03.230 --> 00:43:08.670]
congratulations and the best of luck to you in your new studios thank you it was funny because i

[00:43:08.670 --> 00:43:13.450]
as i was listening to you on hold it sounded muffled for some reason like you're eating them mic

[00:43:13.450 --> 00:43:19.510]
but on here how about that tip there no it does you know well i i don't know what to tell you about

[00:43:19.510 --> 00:43:23.030]
that because it sounds okay in here in my monitor and it sounds great on the air is what

[00:43:23.030 --> 00:43:28.550]
everybody's telling me like better than even usual oh well so maybe it's just maybe just to keep

[00:43:28.550 --> 00:43:33.290]
on your toes while you're on hold hey that's true you know it's a new studio and you know

[00:43:33.290 --> 00:43:36.810]
what else it might be what to discourage some of the pain in the ass people who call just to

[00:43:36.810 --> 00:43:39.810]
stay on hold because they don't have their radio and think that they're going to listen to the show

[00:43:39.810 --> 00:43:44.810]
and tie up a line that could be it well that's true but you think to tell you first of all

[00:43:46.210 --> 00:43:51.690]
the raising of the banner at the at the game last night was unbelievable that's a great

[00:43:51.690 --> 00:43:57.710]
experience even though i was not there even to sit and watch it on tv it brought tears to my

[00:43:57.710 --> 00:44:03.730]
eyes yeah i mean it really did and i can't wait till the new stadium comes in and i will be at the

[00:44:03.730 --> 00:44:12.490]
games second of all they had on on sports channel they had the um vice president general manager

[00:44:12.490 --> 00:44:17.790]
of sports channel they were talking about the panthers and the thing with tci and all that yeah

[00:44:17.790 --> 00:44:23.210]
not much to say but the just that they're saying oh well they're in negotiations and it's going

[00:44:23.210 --> 00:44:27.950]
well and they didn't basically say anything so they just remember man in the words of bob green

[00:44:27.950 --> 00:44:34.590]
it's not a question of if it's a question of when that's true the the call by the referee by the way

[00:44:34.590 --> 00:44:41.830]
as everybody's been saying yeah i mean it was unbelievable yeah to me i cost us the game cost us one

[00:44:41.830 --> 00:44:45.690]
point in the standings i hope that point doesn't come home the hottest later on uh toward the end

[00:44:45.690 --> 00:44:49.930]
of the season because they definitely took a point away from us last night we should be three and

[00:44:49.930 --> 00:44:55.570]
right now that's right i mean they were even talking about i i was listening to um q a m this

[00:44:55.570 --> 00:45:01.190]
morning and they were talking about it and even and i don't generally listen to q a m yeah but uh

[00:45:01.190 --> 00:45:06.730]
they were talking about it and how bad it was and also they were saying that they had a statement

[00:45:06.730 --> 00:45:11.910]
from the league office saying that the call was a correct call yeah forget about that yeah what

[00:45:11.910 --> 00:45:17.530]

[00:46:40.690 --> 00:46:45.690]

right pressman is in this building believe me this building will be so antiseptic it'll be disgusting

[00:47:09.810 --> 00:47:15.670]
listen my question if you've seen these commercials about rolleys been doing about yes i have that's

[00:47:15.670 --> 00:47:19.770]
right these propaganda pieces about hey it's only got to cost you a few bucks and it'll be great

[00:47:19.770 --> 00:47:23.850]
and it's right there at the port of Miami and Mickey likes it and don't by any baloney but what I

[00:47:23.850 --> 00:47:27.350]
don't understand is nobody seems to be telling why you did a little bit yesterday but with the

[00:47:27.350 --> 00:47:32.030]
corruption going on in the city of Miami i mean now that it goes from 30 million to 68 million and

[00:47:32.030 --> 00:47:37.250]
now Miller Dawkins pleads guilty oh thank god we got good honest government in date county we got

[00:47:37.250 --> 00:47:42.890]
people like Miller Dawkins and Cesar Odeus and Barry Schreiber and Johnny Jones at his gold

[00:47:42.890 --> 00:47:47.990]
plumbing fixtures and the list goes on and on and Joe Carrillo with his friend portwanda with

[00:47:47.990 --> 00:47:52.630]
187 grand down the toilet to try to kick the panthers out of town we got the best politicians

[00:47:52.630 --> 00:47:57.190]
that money can't buy man i mean i just feel sorry my mother-in-law she lives in the city of Miami

[00:47:57.190 --> 00:48:01.450]
she pays her sorry taxes and it's just like people don't care what they do with you know with the money

[00:48:01.450 --> 00:48:07.650]
it's yeah and i guess kerson's got some room to put up for rent over in australia someplace yeah

[00:48:07.650 --> 00:48:12.490]
well how's he doing by the way i guess anybody hearing from joe the state there's another one for

[00:48:12.490 --> 00:48:17.030]
you're right there's another one we kind of forgot about or he just slipped away and slipped our

[00:48:17.030 --> 00:48:23.030]
mind yeah well he's out on the land down in australia have a great time joe don't spend it all in one place

[00:48:23.030 --> 00:48:27.390]
unreal but when i don't understand it how can they even come up with thinking they're going to be

[00:48:27.390 --> 00:48:32.150]
putting up a new arena when the city's in in this rate the way it is yeah i don't understand when

[00:48:32.150 --> 00:48:37.330]
it's three blocks from the prison one when nobody wants to put up the money for it when uh it's

[00:48:37.330 --> 00:48:43.990]
an addition to which the guy comes on the year on qa m last week admits admits that when he went

[00:48:43.990 --> 00:48:48.170]
up there to broward the first time when he were you know voting in the new arena deal with Wayne

[00:48:48.170 --> 00:48:53.010]
that he had a 50 50 deal that he could add a sweet deal for the heat and the panthers coexist

[00:48:53.010 --> 00:48:58.170]
everybody get along stop being selfish stop being primit honest and that when they came back to date

[00:48:58.170 --> 00:49:03.870]
in his words well the powers that be which of course means the people at the herald and uh

[00:49:03.870 --> 00:49:07.450]
whoever else he's in bed with over there they made him an offer he couldn't refuse and they put

[00:49:07.450 --> 00:49:11.650]
this deal together in date and now that they try to put that thing together of course he can't go

[00:49:11.650 --> 00:49:14.790]
crawling on his hands and he's to wait because now they don't have such a good deal up there

[00:49:14.790 --> 00:49:18.630]
well why did he lie to them in the first place are we supposed to feel sorry for him that he

[00:49:18.630 --> 00:49:25.070]
that he stabbed the public in the back and lied through his teeth micky screw him so now is is uh

[00:49:25.070 --> 00:49:30.690]
the by the way we got the heat on w i o d baby oh is the new arena going to be strictly the

[00:49:30.690 --> 00:49:33.990]
panthers is not going to be any other franchise going in there then right that's the only sports

[00:49:33.990 --> 00:49:37.530]
that'll be in there they'll be concerts there be like uh the old folks who go in there and like have

[00:49:37.530 --> 00:49:42.150]
a philosophy bagpull stuff like that but it'll be their own everything that's right that's awesome

[00:49:42.150 --> 00:49:46.570]
that's awesome see people were saying to me last night and i realized i appreciate it that in the

[00:49:46.570 --> 00:49:51.130]
president arena you look up there on those those so-called diamond boards or whatever they are up

[00:49:51.130 --> 00:49:55.690]
at the ends you know and they're still the same crappy stuff we had four years ago but again

[00:49:55.690 --> 00:50:00.310]
that the panthers have no control over that they have no they can't change that uh the city

[00:50:00.310 --> 00:50:04.830]
evidently has the control over the room ever and uh nobody can change any that the only thing

[00:50:04.830 --> 00:50:09.590]
that they were able to change and thank god for this is uh the glass anybody else noticed they took

[00:50:09.590 --> 00:50:14.250]
the dividers they've got the new styled nhl glass now around the arena so that they take the

[00:50:14.250 --> 00:50:19.110]
dividers out which makes it i mean your vision is unimpaired anywhere you see everything wow that's

[00:50:19.110 --> 00:50:23.350]

[00:52:35.370 --> 00:52:43.430]
promised started and um what does that mean whatever you say comes up before i'm asking George what

[00:52:43.430 --> 00:52:49.130]
what is the uh we got a problem here the what the pre-delay is going on the air a little bit they

[00:52:49.130 --> 00:52:52.690]
are looking into it oh they're looking into it well good that gets them out of here anyway

[00:52:52.690 --> 00:52:58.490]
and also what is happening also is that they are trying to fine tune your your voice on the ear

[00:52:59.030 --> 00:53:05.030]
the way they have it no it's fine they're trying to find my voice fine tune oh fine tune it

[00:53:05.530 --> 00:53:10.030]
with the way they have it no it sounds good what yeah what they're doing well what they you know

[00:53:10.030 --> 00:53:14.350]
what you see is what you get i mean this is all i got what they're doing is they're putting a lot of

[00:53:14.350 --> 00:53:18.830]
base in your voice yeah and it's sounded as if you're on the nose it sounds better like i have

[00:53:18.830 --> 00:53:24.090]
really big balls right yeah it's on the back you're on the red desk as well well it sounds good no

[00:53:24.090 --> 00:53:28.570]
it sounds like it sounds okay now it sounds like FM yeah well it sounds like FM now

[00:53:29.290 --> 00:53:32.570]
oh we're good street now we're always walking around here with a perplexed look on his face like

[00:53:32.570 --> 00:53:36.430]
we have no idea what the problem is and this will give us something to work on it's we like that

[00:53:36.430 --> 00:53:41.210]
I'd also want more let me tell you when you have a big build up like this and you have all this

[00:53:41.210 --> 00:53:45.390]
fancy very expensive equipment and you make the big move and you make you know you blow the trumpet

[00:53:45.390 --> 00:53:49.830]
or whatever you're blowing uh it's no fun unless you got some glitches in the beginning well what it

[00:53:49.830 --> 00:53:55.330]
proves also is that the first time is not always the greatest that well we all know that trust me

[00:53:55.330 --> 00:53:59.630]
and why the anticipation may be great but we know that once uh you get into it the second time is

[00:53:59.630 --> 00:54:04.990]
that's right and one last thing is that there is a constant humming

[00:54:07.590 --> 00:54:13.970]
on on the like I said this is a bunch of crap and this started while i was listening to one

[00:54:13.970 --> 00:54:20.490]
many that were the news this is a bunch of hoey yeah and and it's also when that is a bunch of

[00:54:20.490 --> 00:54:26.070]
hoey right when when you when you throw it to George the home continues as well so are you

[00:54:26.070 --> 00:54:33.510]

[00:54:33.510 --> 00:54:38.310]
it's on both sides when you throw it to George the home continues so in other words even when i'm

[00:54:38.310 --> 00:54:44.870]
in this right huh say what the hum's gone where was it coming from new technology from our new

[00:54:44.870 --> 00:54:48.970]
technology in other words there was a pot that was open in there somebody was smoking it and uh

[00:54:48.970 --> 00:54:52.710]
they were humming it they were humming it tuned most of the uh thanks for the we just got the

[00:54:52.710 --> 00:54:57.610]
hum out how do you like that for quick uh for quick service huh but i'll come as usual it's our

[00:54:57.610 --> 00:55:01.410]
do it yourself project we rely on the audience you tell us what's screwed up and we'll get

[00:55:01.410 --> 00:55:06.670]
working on it i'll come to you i'll come to you to listen and if anything um right if anything

[00:55:06.670 --> 00:55:10.470]
changes i'll call you tomorrow and listen you sure got the old iod engineering staff me and i'll

[00:55:10.470 --> 00:55:15.590]
tell you that have a great day pal see you man okay there you go open line and date county if

[00:55:15.590 --> 00:55:24.370]
you move real fast 622 wiod 622 9463 oh my god so we got a few little problems in there and for

[00:55:24.370 --> 00:55:28.790]
I sit here and I go on and I we got all this good stuff and they spent millions of dollars of course

[00:55:28.790 --> 00:55:33.770]
there's going to be stuff that screwed up nobody wants perfect it's no fun it's boring when you

[00:55:33.770 --> 00:55:38.810]
come right down to it if it's perfect what's there to bitch about if it were perfect world we'd

[00:55:38.810 --> 00:55:45.410]
all be out of business here's boca hello hi hi Neil you're in boca yeah our first boca call

[00:55:45.410 --> 00:55:50.850]
or how do you like that i'm happy to be on with you yeah and we're happy to be you have you honest

[00:55:50.850 --> 00:55:56.550]
the phone line is clear is it yeah but when i'm on hold it's muffled yeah okay and we don't talk

[00:55:56.550 --> 00:56:01.090]
about that the guy that was just on with you before young on he hit it right on the head did he

[00:56:01.090 --> 00:56:07.270]
there's there's a home accompany with your voice yeah like whenever you before you come out

[00:56:07.890 --> 00:56:14.630]
and like I hear the delay with the home and then you say that yeah you know but other than that

[00:56:14.630 --> 00:56:19.890]
sounds great but so I won't go into that but last night on the dss yes sir I was able to watch

[00:56:19.890 --> 00:56:26.770]
the Panther game on sports channel Florida right now let me have to that surprise you

[00:56:26.770 --> 00:56:32.370]
subscribe to that sports package yeah I only subscribe to nhl center ice right so how's

[00:56:32.370 --> 00:56:37.290]
how's come I got it where did you see it where did I see it yeah I'm well what the channel

[00:56:37.290 --> 00:56:44.710]
um like 300 something well I know I know that but was a 319 or 360 radius something uh it's 319

[00:56:46.330 --> 00:56:49.150]
319 yeah right SCFL

[00:56:51.930 --> 00:56:52.370]
yeah

[00:56:52.370 --> 00:56:57.850]
sports channel Florida right exactly yeah so I just get that I was learning you know what happened

[00:56:57.850 --> 00:57:02.030]
what happened is that they got their rights straightened out see it probably they should have

[00:57:02.030 --> 00:57:07.950]
listed it on the package too okay and uh this we ought to mention this for anybody that's got the

[00:57:07.950 --> 00:57:12.390]
small dish and it's getting a little bit confused and psychotic and they already admitted they screwed

[00:57:12.390 --> 00:57:17.170]
up that uh sunday game in the ranger game at new york so if you don't find it on the center ice

[00:57:17.170 --> 00:57:21.270]
package you will find it on 319 until they find a permanent home for sports channel Florida

[00:57:21.270 --> 00:57:25.530]
but like even a couple hours before the game like before we left the house right to go to the game

[00:57:25.530 --> 00:57:30.250]
right I punched up 319 just to see if anything was on air and sure enough there was nothing on

[00:57:30.250 --> 00:57:35.270]
the screen but it said at the top the program listing uh rangers at the panther sports channel

[00:57:35.270 --> 00:57:40.830]
Florida and that the company with the nhl center ice package what do you mean is that is that

[00:57:40.830 --> 00:57:45.670]
where it's going to be with the nhl center ice package it's with a sports package or it's with

[00:57:45.670 --> 00:57:49.230]
so even if even if you don't have these center ice package if they're televising sports

[00:57:49.230 --> 00:57:53.830]
channel of florida it'll still be on 319 or wherever they wind up putting it eventually right right

[00:57:53.830 --> 00:58:00.570]
got it okay hey um could I say uh could I call my girlfriend a douche bag and make a request

[00:58:00.570 --> 00:58:05.130]
yes you can well making a request uh today anyway could be tough but i'll give it my best shot

[00:58:05.130 --> 00:58:09.030]
all right i don't know if you got it loaded in yet but it's that soccer goal with man ditching

[00:58:09.030 --> 00:58:13.330]
that guy yelling okay pal like i said have a great day and a great life loving the old see uh

[00:58:13.830 --> 00:58:18.810]
okay sure open line of brow art so what's the story i'd like to get a little item the adonnell panic

[00:58:18.810 --> 00:58:23.450]
you know me as long as they pay me i couldn't give a crap what it sounds like but uh what's the story

[00:58:23.450 --> 00:58:28.270]
are we getting a grip on this or what plan huh we're playing with it yeah that's one of a

[00:58:28.270 --> 00:58:33.690]
freight of they're in their plan with it guys that's the problem okay if we address the technical

[00:58:33.690 --> 00:58:37.810]
situation it might sound a little bit better but they're in there didlin with it all right they're

[00:58:37.810 --> 00:58:41.930]
used to it huh we're on the year we're on the year what yeah what the hell do you people want

[00:58:42.490 --> 00:58:45.210]
we're on the year you want it to sound good

[00:58:47.230 --> 00:58:52.710]
Jesus talk about a bunch of pushy bastards they want the brand new place to not only be on the year

[00:58:52.710 --> 00:58:56.770]
but sound perfect on the first day they're not impressed with our millions of dollars worth

[00:58:56.770 --> 00:59:01.090]
equipment and probably the people over there at uh at the old cocks of place over there in north

[00:59:01.090 --> 00:59:05.550]
bay villager uh uh uh uh listen to that they're all screwed up well just waited there too okay

[00:59:05.550 --> 00:59:10.710]
till we're not so screwed up till we get rid of our big hum job just wait till like uh in a

[00:59:10.710 --> 00:59:14.250]
couple of books when they just wait till all the promotion starts just wait till we actually

[00:59:14.250 --> 00:59:17.910]
survive and we do pretty damn good and the log is filled up which it looks pretty good to me right

[00:59:17.910 --> 00:59:24.050]
now anyway oh yeah we can't make money with those guys those guys are a poison there were a lot of

[00:59:24.050 --> 00:59:27.190]
trouble speaking of a lot of trouble by the way we have a lot of fill Henry fans out there and

[00:59:27.190 --> 00:59:31.650]
rightfully so fill is great and we miss him a lot and I just wanted to say that fills already in a

[00:59:31.650 --> 00:59:37.590]
lot of trouble that's the word he did that shakil o'neal but he did that shak routine opening night

[00:59:37.590 --> 00:59:42.930]

[00:59:42.930 --> 00:59:47.730]

[00:59:56.830 --> 01:00:03.590]

[01:09:41.870 --> 01:09:46.690]
except for that third period last night just butch up a little bit save the 30th and 40th beer

[01:09:46.690 --> 01:09:52.450]
until like uh the overtime and yeah we did have a lot of people leave early last night and see

[01:09:52.450 --> 01:09:57.070]
with me that's a mixed bag on the one hand i get very i get aggravated with people like that

[01:09:57.070 --> 01:10:01.670]
because why did you come here why did you buy this show and up spending all that money or even

[01:10:01.670 --> 01:10:05.170]
you know ripping the tickets off from somebody else however you got them

[01:10:06.230 --> 01:10:10.410]
and and then you stay through like the whole game or most of it and would like five a mixed

[01:10:10.410 --> 01:10:14.970]
lois is in here what can you say to that back them and uh and then they leave would like 10 and a half

[01:10:14.970 --> 01:10:18.730]
minutes left in a one-nothing game they start leaving and they kept leaving and they kept leaving

[01:10:18.730 --> 01:10:22.710]
there were thousands of people out of there by the time the regulation ended and overtime

[01:10:22.710 --> 01:10:26.670]
forget it so on the one hand it's depressing but on the other hand it makes it a little easier to

[01:10:26.670 --> 01:10:31.710]
get out of there that's the only negative about 106 man it ain't too easy to get out of that building

[01:10:32.750 --> 01:10:36.370]
1127 at wyd mitch luis is in the building starting rumors that he's Jewish

Here's the Miami

[01:15:38.010 --> 01:15:39.310]
Hello, Buenos dias

[01:15:42.450 --> 01:15:44.630]
Okay, another one. Very interesting

[01:15:44.630 --> 01:15:47.430]
Open line and day, 622-9463

[01:15:47.430 --> 01:15:48.370]
Here's plantation

[01:15:48.370 --> 01:15:50.130]
Hello, hey Neil

[01:15:50.130 --> 01:15:50.690]
Yes, sir

[01:15:51.270 --> 01:15:53.450]
Long time Ranger fan first time caller

[01:15:53.450 --> 01:15:57.570]
Okay, my condolences on what's going to be a long year for you

[01:15:57.570 --> 01:15:59.330]
Well, I've talked about that

[01:15:59.330 --> 01:16:01.710]
But the, I have the little dish, have the Sony dish

[01:16:01.710 --> 01:16:04.090]
And I just want to say

[01:16:04.090 --> 01:16:05.870]
The Ranger fan is the call you all the time

[01:16:05.870 --> 01:16:07.570]
It's a the so-called Ranger fan

[01:16:08.090 --> 01:16:10.330]
Well, I love the Rangers all these years, but now the Panthers here

[01:16:10.330 --> 01:16:12.330]
I hate them. They're not true Ranger fans

[01:16:12.330 --> 01:16:14.250]
Because it stays in your blood your entire life

[01:16:14.250 --> 01:16:18.110]
I love the Panthers 75-76 nights a week, but when the Rangers play them

[01:16:18.110 --> 01:16:19.250]
I can't get out of my sight

[01:16:19.250 --> 01:16:19.990]
I understand that

[01:16:20.850 --> 01:16:23.830]
Anyway, no matter about my Leafs losing the four to two last night, they're down

[01:16:23.830 --> 01:16:25.470]
Two-nothing and the third, they tie it up

[01:16:25.470 --> 01:16:29.730]
And they give up a goal with two and a half minutes left and then an empty net goal to end

[01:16:29.730 --> 01:16:31.890]
But how do you stand when the Leafs play the Panthers

[01:16:31.890 --> 01:16:33.350]
I pull for the Leafs

[01:16:33.770 --> 01:16:35.310]
Oh, okay, well you're not even...

[01:16:35.310 --> 01:16:39.110]
That's why I said to you, I said I can relate to it because I've been a Leafs fan for 38 years now

[01:16:39.110 --> 01:16:41.210]
I'm not changing that allegiance, no matter what

[01:16:41.210 --> 01:16:42.510]
Well, I'm in any circumstances

[01:16:42.510 --> 01:16:45.770]
I'm a 26-year Ranger fan, and I feel the same way, I just can't do it

[01:16:45.770 --> 01:16:51.090]
There's some things in life that are more important than others, and to me the Leafs are right up there near the very top

[01:16:51.090 --> 01:16:53.650]
Panthers are close, but not in a league with the Leafs

[01:16:53.650 --> 01:16:55.990]
You're just like me, well this weekend was a nightmare with the dish

[01:16:55.990 --> 01:17:01.870]
Saturday night I had to work and I taped the game, I went to tape it because I wanted to see Gretzky's first game in the game

[01:17:01.870 --> 01:17:07.110]
Because the Ranger came home to four hours of program not available in your area, got up and fall

[01:17:07.110 --> 01:17:08.230]
Well, they screwed up on Saturday

[01:17:08.230 --> 01:17:14.830]
What happened with me was I ordered with my remote when it was $109 and my machine never registered it so I didn't get it

[01:17:14.830 --> 01:17:16.530]
You know something that the same thing happened with me

[01:17:17.210 --> 01:17:21.990]
Because I called him up, I forget which night, I guess it was Sunday night, I called him up and...

[01:17:21.990 --> 01:17:24.830]
Or Monday, Monday night, which year they had a couple of games on

[01:17:24.830 --> 01:17:28.050]
And they said not available in your area or whatever the hell comes on the bottom

[01:17:28.050 --> 01:17:31.630]
And so I called her up and after bitching her out for five minutes, he says, oh guess what?

[01:17:32.090 --> 01:17:37.070]
If you ordered it by remote, a lot of these never went through and so I'll put it in a bingo, it came on while I was on the phone with her

[01:17:37.070 --> 01:17:37.950]
Yeah, they did it in the voice

[01:17:37.950 --> 01:17:42.910]
They did the same thing for me, but I was so I read about missing Gretzky's premiere that they gave me a $30 credit

[01:17:42.910 --> 01:17:43.390]
So I...

[01:17:43.390 --> 01:17:47.350]
Well, I believe me, it was a real bonus for you because you didn't miss anything

[01:17:47.350 --> 01:17:48.610]
Well, he did nothing

[01:17:48.610 --> 01:17:50.450]
Well, I was a little more polite though, it was a pretty good game it looked like

[01:17:50.450 --> 01:17:51.330]
But he did nothing

[01:17:51.830 --> 01:17:53.870]
Well, he did last night though, but that's a different story

[01:17:53.870 --> 01:17:54.430]
He did what?

[01:17:54.430 --> 01:17:58.270]
He had about six premiere scoring opportunities that he set up

[01:17:58.790 --> 01:18:00.330]
But did he, did he, did they go in?

[01:18:00.830 --> 01:18:05.510]
No, because Beez is in net and the range has just started used to get in passes that quick and they're not finishing yet

[01:18:05.510 --> 01:18:05.890]
Yeah

[01:18:06.430 --> 01:18:10.810]
Well, he had a chance to tip a couple of many had two great scoring chances himself and he shot him wide

[01:18:10.810 --> 01:18:15.650]
He had a great chance they're shorthanded toward the end of the overtime and Beez are stoned in there

[01:18:15.650 --> 01:18:22.370]
I have to get real close last night you could see Kovalov and Graves with their eyes lighting up on some of those passes that they get like

[01:18:22.370 --> 01:18:25.790]
Oh, I see what's going to be happening here, so it's going to gel soon

[01:18:25.790 --> 01:18:27.710]
I don't think so pal, I hate to break the news to you

[01:18:27.710 --> 01:18:31.110]
That's what the Blues thought last year too, but this man he's a...

[01:18:31.110 --> 01:18:36.930]
He's still, you know, you still see flashes of the brilliance and the real nifty passes and some dangerous moves

[01:18:36.930 --> 01:18:40.490]
But he's a shadow of what he was and it did in it, in less than a minute

[01:18:40.490 --> 01:18:45.490]
As soon as he takes his first real solid hit, that's going to be it, he's going to be useless

[01:18:45.490 --> 01:18:47.670]
Well, we could go on for hours about this

[01:18:47.670 --> 01:18:51.230]
His stamina was pretty decent last night and you're right, I agree he has a little lacticity

[01:18:51.230 --> 01:18:58.190]
He's a pussy, let's face it, he's a little pussy and as soon as somebody hits him, he's always holding that helmet and he's running into the bench

[01:18:58.190 --> 01:19:05.490]
I got a headache, you know, he's not used to the physical kind of play that he's going to encounter in our division and our conference

[01:19:05.930 --> 01:19:07.270]
It's a whole different ball game

[01:19:07.870 --> 01:19:10.130]
Totally different ball game, we get to Panthers, that's for sure

[01:19:10.130 --> 01:19:10.690]
One more thing

[01:19:10.690 --> 01:19:12.230]
We looked pretty good last night by the way

[01:19:12.230 --> 01:19:12.670]
Absolutely

[01:19:13.230 --> 01:19:14.010]
We looked real good

[01:19:14.010 --> 01:19:15.510]
It's a real great rival, we already

[01:19:15.510 --> 01:19:19.970]
Rocka look good, Mel and V, Need or Meyer has really putt stuff, he's played two real big games in a row

[01:19:19.970 --> 01:19:21.310]
We're looking pretty damn tough

[01:19:21.310 --> 01:19:22.370]
Hey, I love him, they look good

[01:19:22.370 --> 01:19:25.330]
Jovenoski played smart and good last night, no stupid penalties

[01:19:25.330 --> 01:19:27.430]
Booka Boulman, he got in that deal, huh?

[01:19:27.710 --> 01:19:28.730]
You don't have to convince me

[01:19:28.730 --> 01:19:29.350]
We look good

[01:19:29.350 --> 01:19:34.450]
They look real good, but the other thing was when I called on Sunday night after the Panthers Rangers fiasco on the disc

[01:19:34.450 --> 01:19:41.070]
They said, I don't know if this has been resolved, but they told me they'd only acquired the rights for Sports Channel for Panthers home games

[01:19:41.070 --> 01:19:44.170]
So as it is, I don't have any sports talent on my cable

[01:19:44.590 --> 01:19:45.690]
I don't have to see a way game

[01:19:45.690 --> 01:19:49.150]
I don't think so, I mean when you talk to those bozos then or what they're talking about

[01:19:49.150 --> 01:19:51.290]
I can tell, I could run that place better than they do

[01:19:51.290 --> 01:19:56.690]
One more thing, QAM yesterday during one of your commercials is so called All Sports all the time

[01:19:56.690 --> 01:19:56.990]
Yeah

[01:19:56.990 --> 01:19:59.130]
Opening night for the Panthers, they're talking about

[01:19:59.130 --> 01:20:06.270]
What do you think the final score is going to be if it is upcoming, you know, Florida or whatever it is

[01:20:06.270 --> 01:20:07.850]
FSU, my name is FSU, my name is FSU

[01:20:07.850 --> 01:20:10.690]
Oh yeah, that's important, we're really psyched about that game, man

[01:20:10.690 --> 01:20:11.790]
And what's worth it?

[01:20:20.850 --> 01:20:29.350]
I mean, I think it's worth it, I think it's worth it, I think it's worth it, I think it's worth it

[01:20:29.350 --> 01:20:29.630]
I think it's worth it, I think it's worth it, I think it's worth it, I think it's worth it

[01:20:29.630 --> 01:20:30.210]
I think it's worth it, I think it's worth it, I think it's worth it, I think it's worth it

[01:20:30.210 --> 01:20:32.510]
I think it's worth it, I think it's worth it, I think it's worth it, I think it's worth it

[01:20:32.510 --> 01:20:35.030]
I think it's worth it, I think it's worth it, I think it's worth it, I think it's worth it

[01:20:35.030 --> 01:20:41.770]
I think it's worth it, I think it's worth it, I think it's worth it, I think it's worth it

[01:20:41.770 --> 01:20:45.770]
Logan, they should have a Billboard campaign saying we talk sports but we just don't know the game

[01:20:45.770 --> 01:20:46.970]
They avoid it like the plague

[01:20:46.970 --> 01:20:48.150]
Right, thanks Neo

[01:20:48.150 --> 01:20:49.470]
At least a Hummer knows his crap

[01:20:49.990 --> 01:20:50.890]
Have a great day

[01:20:50.890 --> 01:20:51.630]
You take care

[01:20:51.630 --> 01:20:53.370]
Yeah, crap is his middle name

[01:20:53.370 --> 01:20:54.150]
Hey, stop it

[01:20:54.150 --> 01:20:59.770]
Exactly, we have two open lines in Broward at 767-WYOD, 767-9463

[01:21:00.570 --> 01:21:03.590]
We got all the bugs worked out of here yet or what, we're working on them, okay?

[01:21:03.870 --> 01:21:09.470]
We are working on them feverishly, we got engineers on a ceiling, we got engineers on the floor, we got engineers in Uranus

[01:21:09.470 --> 01:21:13.710]
We got engineers up here in the vacuum, wherever you look, we got engineers crawling all over the damn place

[01:21:14.630 --> 01:21:16.990]
Because we're so intent that we're going to make things right

[01:21:16.990 --> 01:21:21.510]
We want it to be spectacular, we don't want it to just be your ordinary pedestrian-bunch of bull crap

[01:21:21.510 --> 01:21:23.570]
We want it to be spectacular bull crap

[01:21:24.530 --> 01:21:26.790]
Here's a mobile in Miami, hello

[01:21:26.790 --> 01:21:27.410]
Neo

[01:21:27.410 --> 01:21:32.210]
Yes sir, what do you think of our mark for us all of a sudden here in the desert, when can we get rid of them?

[01:21:32.910 --> 01:21:33.770]
What does that mean?

[01:21:34.430 --> 01:21:37.630]
all we need to get rid of them and twice he's done this all what do you mean

[01:21:37.630 --> 01:21:40.830]
that me and i want to ask a question yeah what referee in league you think

[01:21:40.830 --> 01:21:41.970]
does good by us anybody

[01:21:43.970 --> 01:21:46.050]
well actually the guy with the uh...

[01:21:46.050 --> 01:21:49.390]
i'm gonna tell you something that Richard trotchay that frog who was the

[01:21:49.390 --> 01:21:51.070]
referee and it filled off the exhibition game

[01:21:51.070 --> 01:21:53.850]
i remember that new jersey game last year he hates us

[01:21:53.850 --> 01:21:57.050]
hates us i think most of the officials hate us because we're like an upstart

[01:21:57.050 --> 01:22:00.370]
team we're not supposed to be so good we're not supposed to win and they stick

[01:22:00.370 --> 01:22:01.010]
it to us

[01:22:01.510 --> 01:22:05.210]
we can't handle the legal anything and uh... do anything about the

[01:22:05.210 --> 01:22:08.910]
key you can't send tapes into the league on an icing call no no way Jose

[01:22:08.910 --> 01:22:11.110]
i mean that i can call across the game

[01:22:11.110 --> 01:22:12.630]
it no question about it

[01:22:13.250 --> 01:22:14.770]
i was calling i was screaming

[01:22:15.350 --> 01:22:17.030]
but you know something you know something

[01:22:17.510 --> 01:22:19.210]
will still will still take the point

[01:22:19.870 --> 01:22:23.370]
i know we'll take the point but we would prefer to point i mean there's under

[01:22:23.370 --> 01:22:24.570]
two minutes left right

[01:22:24.570 --> 01:22:25.790]
and we had it

[01:22:25.790 --> 01:22:26.790]
amen with you

[01:22:26.790 --> 01:22:31.170]
yeah that's all i got to find the event my frustration with the referee in the

[01:22:31.170 --> 01:22:31.690]
any trial

[01:22:32.810 --> 01:22:35.730]
let's hope next time he comes down here like uh... breaks the leg literally we

[01:22:35.730 --> 01:22:39.850]
have an open line and they'd six to two to the w wild a six to two nine four six

[01:22:39.850 --> 01:22:41.790]
three so Roberto hung up before

[01:22:42.310 --> 01:22:45.290]
and we have a lot of our lady friends out there who are calling to welcome us to

[01:22:45.290 --> 01:22:48.370]
our new surroundings in the say this was really great uh... what's your name

[01:22:48.370 --> 01:22:51.390]
the blade run a girl who i'm sure was at that game you know an interesting thing

[01:22:51.390 --> 01:22:52.390]
in my new seats now

[01:22:52.390 --> 01:22:55.950]
either everybody has developed a sudden hatred toward me which is possible or

[01:22:55.950 --> 01:22:59.210]
uh... it's just too hard to have access to where i'm sitting right now it's

[01:22:59.210 --> 01:23:00.230]
quite a great out of it

[01:23:00.230 --> 01:23:01.210]
it's kind of pleasant

[01:23:02.370 --> 01:23:04.090]
kind of a breath of fresh air

[01:23:04.090 --> 01:23:09.370]
scott the lawn man came down to say hi you can come any time you want scott

[01:23:10.390 --> 01:23:13.790]
make no mistake about it also when we get home from the game last night i go to

[01:23:13.790 --> 01:23:15.650]
let my dogs out and guess what's on the fence

[01:23:15.650 --> 01:23:19.550]
i see my golden retriever jumping up in a year like uh... starting to play butch

[01:23:19.550 --> 01:23:23.010]
boss there's a big possum sitting on my fence

[01:23:24.010 --> 01:23:27.050]
and that damn thing was ready to go hop down and do some serious damage

[01:23:27.050 --> 01:23:29.970]
and if you would have gone after a little log out to say hey go ahead go to it

[01:23:30.790 --> 01:23:32.570]
but uh... ever have a possum on your thing

[01:23:34.850 --> 01:23:38.710]

[01:23:40.190 --> 01:23:41.890]

they're always hanging around the dumpsters

[01:23:52.090 --> 01:23:53.690]
what the possums are the cons

[01:23:54.410 --> 01:23:54.770]

[01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:36.000]
deal yes sir yeah i just uh want to say i think the best thing about last night was that

[01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:41.560]
everybody got to watch the game because there was no baseball on last night and that was rained out

[01:45:41.560 --> 01:45:45.460]
so i think that's right i was thinking that last night that was uh got a lot of extra viewers who

[01:45:45.460 --> 01:45:49.960]
didn't have uh no yanky or yanky or yanky what was that started one today yeah four o'clock oh four

[01:45:49.960 --> 01:46:00.280]
o'clock all right i don't have to get screwed out of that excellent yeah um i i wait so you were

[01:46:00.280 --> 01:46:06.700]
they was fantastic the place went nuts and uh it was just a beautiful thing in fact it's a beautiful

[01:46:06.700 --> 01:46:11.180]
banner i mean that was i think i think that's better than the uh the avalanche i mean the avalanche

[01:46:11.180 --> 01:46:15.200]
has screwed the avalanche they finally beat a girl's team last night but they're one and two were

[01:46:15.200 --> 01:46:19.440]
in better shape than they are yeah i mean but our our banner was a lot better looking i mean

[01:46:19.440 --> 01:46:25.160]
they just have a white banner with their with their logo on it i'm sure realistically we'd

[01:46:25.160 --> 01:46:28.920]
rather have the one that says tap of champions but let's say get back to you know the real world

[01:46:28.920 --> 01:46:34.220]
it was great it was just everything was done very very well the laser stuff was great with all the

[01:46:34.220 --> 01:46:38.740]
names and the numbers of the players and the introductions and the raising of the banner it was just

[01:46:38.740 --> 01:46:43.160]
it was done beautifully i might see our rollers for that that was great and then the thing that

[01:46:43.160 --> 01:46:48.520]
was amazing to me is that over these four years there have been different games like opening night

[01:46:48.520 --> 01:46:52.260]
or whatever and they've said well be sure and be in your seats early by such and such a time

[01:46:52.260 --> 01:46:57.740]
and you know this is such a these people dragged their ass in this town last night it was

[01:46:57.740 --> 01:47:02.700]
unbelievable trying to get to that arena because the people actually showed up and by you know they

[01:47:02.700 --> 01:47:07.460]
said seven ten they waited until seven twenty yeah by seven twenty that place was packed you couldn't

[01:47:07.460 --> 01:47:12.220]
to cram the other sardine in there with a shoehorn yeah you know watching the sports channel

[01:47:12.220 --> 01:47:17.800]
last night the only thing bad about it is is is gotta be net Smith i mean he doesn't have a clue

[01:47:17.800 --> 01:47:27.540]
about hockey i i'm listening to him in exactly i mean he looks like he's he's lost totally

[01:47:27.540 --> 01:47:33.240]

[01:47:33.240 --> 01:47:37.820]
i don't know i just and he's got a radio show too now and and i'm like that's right in fact it's

[01:47:37.820 --> 01:47:41.420]

[01:50:25.200 --> 01:50:31.960]
agree with everything they do you know yeah you're a little hard on black people do you meaning what

[01:50:32.560 --> 01:50:38.440]
well you know like i there is something the something that you say like i understand that it's a joke

[01:50:38.960 --> 01:50:44.420]
and i don't really take it personally but i i've heard like uh other black people call in and

[01:50:44.420 --> 01:50:51.360]
and sort of give you a hard time when you you say about light complex black yeah what's wrong

[01:50:51.360 --> 01:50:55.720]
like that but you say those dark ones you know get away something like that you know that's

[01:50:55.720 --> 01:50:59.400]
really good away i just said if they would just if the black people in america would lighten up a

[01:50:59.400 --> 01:51:04.020]
little bit yeah that's a good idea i think we get all afford to lighten up just a little bit

[01:51:04.020 --> 01:51:10.520]
i understand but that don't you huh don't you think that's true yeah i think so but i just wanted

[01:51:10.520 --> 01:51:16.580]
to let you know you know that's like a very serious and sensitive issue in the black community

[01:51:16.580 --> 01:51:23.440]
what is that well what's the issue of complexion you know why is that it's a thing it's an internal

[01:51:23.440 --> 01:51:27.780]
thing i think that maybe that's why a lot of people in the black community as you call it don't

[01:51:27.780 --> 01:51:34.140]
like michael jackson no or is it maybe because he's a child molester one of the other because he's

[01:51:34.140 --> 01:51:40.460]
a pedophile yes i'd say that might be it or maybe both of the above yeah but i just want to

[01:51:40.460 --> 01:51:46.080]
tell you it's sort of like it's like i said it's a sensitive issue when when especially when

[01:51:46.080 --> 01:51:52.640]
you know a white person says that it's sort of like a sense how about in the malato community is

[01:51:52.640 --> 01:51:58.620]
a complexion of a big issue there i don't know i i don't i'm not familiar with any malato

[01:51:58.620 --> 01:52:03.220]
community well i i don't know any black community either i mean there's like liberty city and

[01:55:49.120 --> 01:55:53.460]
anything about the hurricane since weekend of course not which is one of the biggest games of the year

[01:55:53.460 --> 01:55:57.220]
but why do i care about them i didn't care about them before why should i care now that i hope

[01:55:57.220 --> 01:56:02.540]
i face use scores about eighty points oh you're an fs u fan no the hurricane's are going to kill

[01:56:02.540 --> 01:56:07.020]

[01:56:12.160 --> 01:56:18.280]
ah poor baby no i actually like the hurricane yeah and also so let me ask you this question what do

[01:56:18.280 --> 01:56:21.260]
you think about brine blades going to winning touchdown for c edel and beat the dolphins

[01:56:21.260 --> 01:56:26.260]
sunday that it was a little depressing but he depressing right the dolphins are going to come back

[01:56:26.260 --> 01:56:32.440]
and win this week yeah in buffalo in buffalo um air sim will throw about three touchdown passes

[01:56:32.860 --> 01:56:38.200]
and dolphins will win 21 seven you're okay my book pal the eternal optimist okay have a great life

[01:56:38.200 --> 01:56:43.360]
okay no feel too bad on sand today it's going to be ugly that uh fs u is i know fs u had a little

[01:56:43.360 --> 01:56:47.860]
trouble they've been sputtering early in the game but guess what they keep winning them and a hercones

[01:56:47.860 --> 01:56:52.220]
i mean they did beat up on a girl school pittsburg and pittsburg came back and beat up on temple

[01:56:52.600 --> 01:56:57.460]
which i thought was a grotesque anti-semitic act and it was so embarrassing the temple to lead in that

[01:56:57.460 --> 01:57:01.900]
game like 16 times that the coach quittin said if we're going to lose to a team like that then uh

[01:57:01.900 --> 01:57:06.820]
screwed gonna be a long Saturday man just get used to it 1229 at w i o d

[01:57:06.820 --> 01:57:11.320]
entertainment radio 16 w i o d

[01:57:12.260 --> 01:57:18.380]
you work hard you play harder and when the heat is on you're losing crucial bodily fluids

[01:57:18.380 --> 01:57:24.500]
fluids you've got to replenish if you want to keep going do it with urine the all natural

[01:57:24.500 --> 01:57:30.420]
sport strength it gives back what nature takes away great game jack let's say we hit the clubhouse

[01:57:30.420 --> 01:57:38.020]
knock back a couple of urans urine now you're talking warm wet wonderful urine kidney filtered so

[01:57:38.020 --> 01:57:46.020]
it's always clear never cloudy urine it's pure drinking satisfaction we punish your body the way

[01:57:46.020 --> 01:57:54.820]
nature intended with 100% natural urine urine it's number one all right it's 12 for 34 even

[01:57:54.820 --> 01:57:58.720]

[01:58:03.280 --> 01:58:06.920]
great thing how do you like that even the bug man is friendly if we can just get some food to

[01:58:22.060 --> 01:58:27.680]
once going twice hello hello Neil yes sir how's it going great i haven't talked to you

[01:58:27.680 --> 01:58:33.760]
god since the playoffs ended last year yeah out of town this summer and i just got back in and

[01:58:33.760 --> 01:58:40.780]
just wanted to wish you a just a time for the panthers great start yeah right excellent excellent

[01:58:40.780 --> 01:58:46.480]
haven't missed the game yet so uh but uh last night's game was a little disheartening but uh that's

[01:58:46.480 --> 01:58:50.660]
well when the lines been screwed you went uh when a miserable frog in a backstabbing Russian

[01:58:50.660 --> 01:58:55.260]
conspired to get together to take the uh gay the winnowing from you it is very disheartening yeah make

[01:58:55.260 --> 01:58:58.920]
no mistake about it yeah like you said earlier though we we got a point out of it and i'm sure

[01:58:58.920 --> 01:59:04.100]
we'll we'll encounter quite a few more situations like that but i guess you just kind of have to take

[01:59:04.100 --> 01:59:08.980]
them as they come um and then of course healy all of a sudden had to come to Miami and find the good

[01:59:08.980 --> 01:59:12.700]
stuff whatever was that he was on last night because i've never seen anything like that performance

[01:59:12.700 --> 01:59:17.340]
he pulled off the last time i saw anybody well i wasn't really that long ago when biser and

[01:59:17.340 --> 01:59:22.600]
Patrick frog got involved at last game we played the avalanche game four yeah well that gold tending was

[01:59:22.600 --> 01:59:27.200]
i would say on the same par with the way that healy played last night he was unbelievable yeah that

[01:59:27.200 --> 01:59:31.740]
was that was a good move by the rangers coach to put healy in there i was i was really hoping with

[01:59:31.740 --> 01:59:36.180]
see rick you know played he i rick the shot is low in the world cup man he played phenomenal in

[01:59:36.180 --> 01:59:40.800]
there he was unconscious he was great and then uh you know i think he had a tremendous letdown

[01:59:40.800 --> 01:59:44.340]
when the season started he played very weak the first two games he gave the bruins four and he

[01:59:44.340 --> 01:59:48.960]
opened or we got five on him on sunday so that's nine and two games and they figured just uh you

[01:59:48.960 --> 01:59:53.820]
cool as jets a little wild stick healy in there and he was great yeah i was glad the panthers were able to

[01:59:53.820 --> 01:59:57.740]
you know at least get get a goal in there i don't remember if you remember last season it seems

[01:59:57.740 --> 02:00:01.640]
like when the panthers were in there they're a little splump towards the second half of the season

[02:00:01.640 --> 02:00:05.780]
yeah we couldn't stick it in the ocean yeah it seemed like we were always running in the hot gold

[02:00:05.780 --> 02:00:09.800]
tenders so right hopefully this is just like i thought you know something i thought we looked

[02:00:09.800 --> 02:00:14.380]
outstanding last night the atmosphere in the joint was like a playoff game the team looks like a

[02:00:14.380 --> 02:00:19.360]
real honest a goodness team where you know we're not anybody that says we play boring now i'm sorry

[02:00:19.360 --> 02:00:22.900]
i don't buy that i mean the third period sure we had a shut it down a little bit we knew we had

[02:00:22.900 --> 02:00:27.200]
to protect that one of the lead but the first two periods we outplayed them dramatically we had

[02:00:27.200 --> 02:00:31.420]
breakaway after breakaway our passing was really good in those first two periods it kind of

[02:00:31.420 --> 02:00:35.680]
vanished on the third but uh we're looking good this is a real team yeah they they they did look

[02:00:35.680 --> 02:00:39.740]
excellent and i don't care what anybody says i mean i like Brad Smith but these people around me

[02:00:39.740 --> 02:00:44.760]
said oh yeah we'd rather have him than shepherd shepherd is a pure goal scorer he came you know he

[02:00:44.760 --> 02:00:48.520]
considering he's been out for a while he looked pretty good to me last night he looked just fine

[02:00:48.520 --> 02:00:53.120]
i was glad to have him back in the way that amen that's for sure i guess the only the only negative

[02:00:53.120 --> 02:00:57.660]
point last night about the whole game had to be that uh that announcer i've heard a couple people

[02:00:57.660 --> 02:01:02.880]
rag what's his name net smith or whatever yeah he was a complete idiot uh he referred to the hockey

[02:01:02.880 --> 02:01:09.400]
players as ball players last night had a boy nid what a jackass what a bozo i didn't know they played

[02:01:09.400 --> 02:01:13.460]
with balls in the hockey at least not down on the ice yeah and in his case i think uh it's an

[02:01:14.180 --> 02:01:20.360]
exaggeration yes so uh that and the only other thing i wanted to touch on is uh rimmer i like

[02:01:20.360 --> 02:01:24.220]
rimmer i don't want to give the guy a hard time but we're going to get a penalty upcoming here

[02:01:24.760 --> 02:01:29.600]
looks like the robot's eye retaliated at something that went on with he and retinot water and the

[02:01:29.600 --> 02:01:36.200]
pathers will get a power play rines scrublin pathers have the net empty off he Lee breathe out scores

[02:01:36.200 --> 02:01:42.460]
poppy fits jerald oh the white pet away the pathers are on the board and Lee won to the

[02:01:42.460 --> 02:01:48.720]
up one oh oh oh oh yeah you were saying there you go no i'm not not a hard way but he has this

[02:01:48.720 --> 02:01:54.160]
he has this one liner that he says like every game i don't whether especially when they're away

[02:01:54.160 --> 02:01:58.800]
when the crowd gets into it and something happens the other team he always goes much to the

[02:01:58.800 --> 02:02:02.320]
delight of the crowd that just drives me nuts when he says you know what you don't have a

[02:02:02.320 --> 02:02:06.720]
rines me of it's mara it's like mara of albert with it he hears it from the crowd if i ever have to

[02:02:06.720 --> 02:02:11.780]
hear that again from our albert i'm personally going to take care of his ugly ass he hears it from

[02:02:11.780 --> 02:02:15.500]
the crowd get out of here with that new york crap get out of our face barb you make me sick go

[02:02:15.500 --> 02:02:19.980]
i eat some uh the humontosh or something get out of here well maybe if rimmer's listening he'll

[02:02:19.980 --> 02:02:23.460]
change he'll change it up or something yeah hold your breath but other than that he's a great

[02:02:23.460 --> 02:02:28.400]
announcer and i'm taking he's taking his mic lang lessons right now is he he's working on it all

[02:02:43.880 --> 02:02:48.380]
the one of the games before yeah before the game started uh oh and up to him and i talked him

[02:08:35.900 --> 02:08:38.820]
cal air on the top of the front i don't think they're going to touch that because it ain't

[02:08:38.820 --> 02:08:43.100]
their building and they don't want to get evicted this tiller here's a tamarack hello

[02:08:58.900 --> 02:09:04.080]
checked the trouble please try again later what does that what does that mean i have no idea and then

[02:09:04.080 --> 02:09:07.980]
i tried the eight eight eight number i got a busy signal but i get to show that you can dial the

[02:09:07.980 --> 02:09:12.700]
eight eight eight number from nine from the nine five four eight area code okay okay and i have

[02:09:12.700 --> 02:09:16.840]
a i just have a question i'm not making a request or anything since since i know you can now

[02:09:16.840 --> 02:09:21.660]
play trouser trod and sporting a woody are you now free to play if you can ever find it someday the

[02:09:21.660 --> 02:09:29.700]
the what the air one time only executive washroom bit oh that that's gone that's long gone you won't

[02:09:29.700 --> 02:09:33.440]
find that i know what you're talking about yeah you will yeah i remember you played it one time

[02:09:33.440 --> 02:09:36.920]
over it when you still know what they've built about a hundred years ago and you said that you

[02:09:36.920 --> 02:09:40.120]
got so much uh... flat from people you couldn't play it again so i was wondering if you ever

[02:09:40.120 --> 02:09:45.660]
free to play that one if we can find it okay i think i called let me say again if you actually

[02:09:45.660 --> 02:09:50.700]
have now over there if george can find it i guess you can now play trouser trod again how do you like that

[02:09:50.700 --> 02:09:55.140]
but you are free how do you like that for being so repressed from all these experts out there at

[02:09:55.140 --> 02:09:58.840]
excess and all these people are writing the a little parochial yoke news papers about how

[02:09:58.840 --> 02:10:02.180]
paxons gonna clamp down and now we can play all kinds of stuff that we couldn't play out of the

[02:10:02.180 --> 02:10:06.960]
cops people how do you like them apples well anything just new nick says i don't believe anyway so i

[02:10:06.960 --> 02:10:11.260]
figure if he says something you just believe the opposite okay pal okay take a meal every life

[02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:16.100]
that's a good point we better start uh... where am i going to put my fingers on those two by the way the

[02:10:16.100 --> 02:10:20.100]
uh... those uh... rock comedy the ones that were in like a little box so they certainly are to appear

[02:10:20.100 --> 02:10:26.120]
are they they're probably uh... long gone the ones he was just talking about trouser trout

[02:10:26.120 --> 02:10:31.640]
what do you mean for so that good great stuff that we need to keep playing over and over again

[02:10:31.640 --> 02:10:37.860]
boy do i know where my crap is or what huh do i know my crap mister or what but boys did a pain in the

[02:10:37.860 --> 02:10:41.680]
ass having to deal with these i don't want to get right press enough said but this is this is

[02:10:41.680 --> 02:10:46.080]
very seriously a pain in the ass because i see a real nice space back here with that cd deck would

[02:10:46.080 --> 02:10:46.640]
just perfect

[02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:49.360]
max

[02:10:50.320 --> 02:10:51.640]
this is a pain in the ass

[02:10:52.400 --> 02:10:57.220]
this is a pain in the ass although the fact is that will eventually have this all in here anyway so we

[02:10:57.220 --> 02:11:01.820]
won't have to worry about it because as far as i'm concerned these these uh... these uh... jewel case

[02:11:01.820 --> 02:11:04.120]
things with the cd's this this is worse than carts

[02:11:04.940 --> 02:11:08.000]
at least the cart you can just stick it in there so to speak

[02:11:08.380 --> 02:11:12.380]
but with this thing you got a patch you're on you got to take the old one out you got to you got to

[02:11:12.380 --> 02:11:16.580]
stick all of them in these which god forbid we do that will have all the way what is it

[02:11:16.580 --> 02:11:20.300]
said i don't know if we give you a player or one without that you don't need a case for him when

[02:11:20.300 --> 02:11:22.640]
that does need case without the okay

[02:11:23.020 --> 02:11:24.260]
isn't that what i was talking about

[02:11:25.080 --> 02:11:26.600]
isn't that what i suggested yesterday

[02:11:29.840 --> 02:11:31.360]
yeah how about it

[02:11:33.240 --> 02:11:37.480]
isn't that what we have okay must be losing my mind isn't that what you told great idea roya

[02:11:37.480 --> 02:11:40.720]
yeah now exactly roya just came up with a hell of a good idea

[02:11:40.720 --> 02:11:45.380]
let's just get a player in here like a regular cd deck to sit back here that doesn't need these

[02:11:45.380 --> 02:11:50.820]
stupid jewel cases on it god what a great idea i think that sounds pretty good to me all right

[02:11:50.820 --> 02:11:57.860]
yeah all right sports fans see if it's their idea that great see i'm using the wrong side

[02:11:57.860 --> 02:12:03.920]
college here right George nice thinking guys let's do it okay here's a pop it all hello

[02:12:03.920 --> 02:12:08.180]
i do it now okay uh what's up with those leaves

[02:12:08.880 --> 02:12:13.680]
why they lost the game yeah so what about all huh they're brutal what does what does that mean

[02:12:13.680 --> 02:12:17.280]
they were they kicked the crap out of the ducks on Saturday what do you want oh yeah that's

[02:12:17.280 --> 02:12:23.240]
here that duck that you got there in the car yeah if they if the leaves uh couldn't buy a win

[02:12:23.240 --> 02:12:27.480]
they if they paid for their wins with their testicles they still come out under 500 yeah

[02:12:27.480 --> 02:12:31.040]
they'd be 40 and 40 they're gonna have a bad year so what's a big deal they better be doing

[02:12:31.040 --> 02:12:36.840]
something that farm system they're not they're not they stink oh my goodness yeah and closing yeah

[02:12:37.480 --> 02:12:43.460]
and goalboard for calvaca to open lines in date i have no idea what that means but i do like the way

[02:12:43.460 --> 02:12:48.300]
you say i think that's like part of ayarta six two two nine four six three six two two

[02:12:48.880 --> 02:12:54.220]
w i d boy sure do like like i said i love these cd decks we don't need that cd thing in here do we

[02:12:54.220 --> 02:12:58.160]
of course if they're willing to put in here we'll go along with anything but it might not be a real

[02:12:58.160 --> 02:13:01.880]
bad idea since it saves a lot of time do you want to say

[02:13:18.900 --> 02:13:24.940]
people are watching women are staring on their green roof and

[02:13:24.940 --> 02:13:32.060]
oh but i'm not sharing some say he's brainless now much don't talk

[02:13:32.060 --> 02:13:40.780]
in not much to look at but i ain't looking his smells just a little too much

[02:13:41.740 --> 02:13:50.200]
is that all a little too close his nose is just a little too long

[02:13:51.460 --> 02:13:55.700]
but while they're running i will be moaning

[02:13:55.700 --> 02:13:59.660]
all then he's got a really big trials of trials

[02:14:01.400 --> 02:14:04.340]
the girls with screaming they let it out

[02:14:05.800 --> 02:14:10.560]
he's got a really big trials of trials i'm fishing for the

[02:14:10.560 --> 02:14:10.900]
oh

[02:14:15.300 --> 02:14:18.300]
he's got a really big trials of trials

[02:14:19.800 --> 02:14:23.520]
that part can make me just twist and shout

[02:14:24.700 --> 02:14:29.340]
he's got a really big trials of trials of fishing for the

[02:14:32.340 --> 02:14:33.020]
oh

[02:14:43.740 --> 02:14:48.480]
he's got a really big trials of trials

[02:14:53.920 --> 02:14:58.920]
they're complaining that the pitch is off what are you talking about?

[02:14:59.120 --> 02:15:03.200]
pitch this what we got about to you know something those calls are going to be coming from

[02:15:03.200 --> 02:15:09.580]

[02:15:09.580 --> 02:15:15.680]
what it is low on outside for strike four what are these people the hawk at a china kibata

[02:15:16.940 --> 02:15:18.740]
there's nothing wrong with the pitch on it

[02:15:21.980 --> 02:15:24.580]
maybe they like to hear that one of those old-fashioned decks that the brother

[02:15:24.580 --> 02:15:27.380]

[02:15:34.980 --> 02:15:38.360]

ones i guess the older they are the dumber they get they go like real early and i look out

[02:22:46.180 --> 02:22:50.320]
there there's this a big skinny kids standing in the middle of street looking and obviously he's the

[02:22:50.320 --> 02:22:53.800]
one that rang the bell and i just kind of sauntered out there as i thrown my clothes on real quickly

[02:22:53.800 --> 02:23:00.580]
and i got my newspaper and gave my dirty look and walk back inside and so tomorrow or in future days

[02:23:00.580 --> 02:23:03.900]
if he decides he'd like to you know coming in early in the morning and bring the doorbell i might

[02:23:03.900 --> 02:23:07.840]
just have a little surprise for him i might just do a little number on the belly you know what i'm

[02:23:07.840 --> 02:23:12.800]
saying or something else but hey that's the way it goes out in the acres boy they got a real good

[02:23:12.800 --> 02:23:17.120]
sense of humor they're good old bunch of guys here's a deer field hello

[02:23:17.680 --> 02:23:22.280]
what's going on now yes sir first let me say what a juggernaut is that the 24 hour sports station

[02:23:22.280 --> 02:23:28.820]
does that qualify guy you can even speak hockey too right um but they got smith he knows peter and

[02:23:28.820 --> 02:23:33.840]
zedzel i'm getting them in a second uh i say i want to not keep it 22 years and without a doubt

[02:23:33.840 --> 02:23:39.960]
that is the worst trio of hockey announces in sports in hockey and maybe in sports they're worse than

[02:23:39.960 --> 02:23:44.960]
quarter and jay Randolph last night you would never hear someone like jay jandayvits

[02:23:44.960 --> 02:23:48.520]
and zed something like pavent said at the end of the game the referee goes over the rangers

[02:23:48.520 --> 02:23:52.900]
out that out that exit and he goes he's probably going back to the hotel with him on the same bus

[02:23:52.900 --> 02:23:58.900]
just totally unprofessional who said that Denise yeah Denise and uh we're rumors no better

[02:23:59.980 --> 02:24:05.800]
he's he's a homerole so oh what he's a what he's a homerole yeah but i mean your pavent

[02:24:05.800 --> 02:24:09.340]
at this grace i mean you got a good hockey team here but you got i hate what's wrong with being a

[02:24:09.340 --> 02:24:13.520]
homerole tell me that jd don't show for the rangers come on let's get serious now he wouldn't have

[02:24:13.520 --> 02:24:18.980]
the come on huh he wouldn't have the job for fox if he did oh come on he does not not well not

[02:24:18.980 --> 02:24:23.240]
when he's doing the red the fox games but during the msg telecast come on very very very

[02:24:23.240 --> 02:24:27.640]
hard on the rangers he you know he's he's very down on him right now he you know he's a realist

[02:24:27.640 --> 02:24:31.320]
he's not like these you know rumor who think you know just whines about everything you know

[02:24:31.320 --> 02:24:37.720]
everything's an anti you know you know anti rangers plan i mean the hit let the other day on

[02:24:37.720 --> 02:24:41.540]
half i mean he made it out to be murder i mean the guy has to protect himself along the boards too

[02:24:41.540 --> 02:24:46.720]
yeah i mean he took the hit msg hit him and uh he didn't kill him he could have drove me war

[02:24:46.720 --> 02:24:52.200]
it was a very ugly and very nasty and potentially a very potentially huh to compare it to

[02:24:52.200 --> 02:24:56.680]
clone when he was crazy what when you did it not he hit him from behind and the guy got up he didn't

[02:24:56.680 --> 02:25:02.220]
protect himself and even here you even heard the coach say it's almost like uh well i disagree

[02:25:02.220 --> 02:25:05.980]
with the and obviously the league did two and for them to give msg a two games i mean the league is

[02:25:05.980 --> 02:25:11.080]
very as you know very leery of giving the superstars any suspensions at all and to give him two games

[02:25:11.080 --> 02:25:16.380]
brine berk must have thought it was pretty damn bad it was suspended hitting hitting from behind as

[02:25:16.380 --> 02:25:21.600]
you know if you're a real hockey fan and you are hitting from behind is unacceptable it is but

[02:25:21.600 --> 02:25:26.300]
it's also the place responsibility as far as you leave it well well to a point but i mean you know

[02:25:26.300 --> 02:25:29.360]
you can only uh you know you don't have eyes in the back of your head and i realized

[02:25:29.360 --> 02:25:33.380]
how new he was coming which is what saved him on that play but there was also the chance he

[02:25:33.380 --> 02:25:36.620]
didn't know okay and if he wouldn't have known he could have been writing chris draper's shoes

[02:25:37.520 --> 02:25:41.440]
skates well i i mean i think msg would go for his throw like you know let me know did but uh

[02:25:42.440 --> 02:25:46.260]
i don't know and i think i think you're jumping the gun a little bit too quick on the rain is

[02:25:46.260 --> 02:25:50.280]
you know knocking down grepski he's definitely not the same player he was but the guy listen

[02:25:50.280 --> 02:25:56.920]
you talk about people who are realists i admit i confessed that i hate wane grepski i hate him like

[02:25:56.920 --> 02:26:02.520]
poison i was screaming about the game last night every time he made a bad pass i was yelling but the fact

[02:26:02.520 --> 02:26:06.940]
is i'm telling you very realistically as a guy who watches a lot of hockey i got two satellite

[02:26:06.940 --> 02:26:12.280]
dishes i watch more games in one year than most people see in a lifetime wane grepski i don't think

[02:26:12.280 --> 02:26:15.580]
is going to be any great shakes for the rangers and they're going to rule the day that they got him

[02:26:15.580 --> 02:26:19.560]
well i i you know you might be right there but let's look what you do let's show you have 102

[02:26:19.560 --> 02:26:24.720]
points this year with a bunch of stiff out now like a king that was folding he was he was almost

[02:26:24.720 --> 02:26:29.700]
single-handedly responsible for dismantling the kings he's the one that forced into trade away coffee

[02:26:29.700 --> 02:26:34.200]
and to trade away a robot high and make all the deals that they did because he doesn't and also

[02:26:34.200 --> 02:26:37.840]
it's going to be very interesting to see how he and robot i get along on the rangers because they

[02:26:37.840 --> 02:26:41.760]
hate each other like poison that's true i mean he's a disruptive force you know when you're paying

[02:26:41.760 --> 02:26:46.520]
somebody that much money who's at toward the end of the line and he comes in and gets it disrupts

[02:26:46.520 --> 02:26:50.580]
the chemistry of the team it's not a good deal i'm telling you you want you mark my words

[02:26:50.580 --> 02:26:53.820]
you notice robot i was benched last night in the third period i would hold i was hoping it would

[02:26:53.820 --> 02:26:57.740]
and he was benched yep i you know i don't know what that's all about because he was the most

[02:26:57.740 --> 02:27:01.020]
dangerous guy they had on the ice the first two periods and i said to john on a way home i

[02:27:01.020 --> 02:27:04.660]
said i never saw robot time the third period they benched him yep well let's look at his

[02:27:04.660 --> 02:27:08.660]
contract he makes six point two million dollars a year right look look at the time goal on the ice

[02:27:08.660 --> 02:27:13.680]
who was on the ice covala grace central he wasn't one of the he wasn't one of the six players on

[02:27:13.680 --> 02:27:16.960]
you just got through saying they didn't play the third period so i can even one of the players on

[02:27:16.960 --> 02:27:20.240]
the ice that's what i'm just saying you know there's there's your big superstar twenty two million

[02:27:20.240 --> 02:27:25.480]
dollars yeah well i mean like i said it's going to be a long uh disruptive year in new york because

[02:27:25.480 --> 02:27:29.240]
there he knows that they don't want them there that uh they don't they feel like you do

[02:27:29.240 --> 02:27:32.740]
and he's not going to play well he knows greetski hates him i'm just telling you you know you

[02:27:32.740 --> 02:27:35.900]
want to be a realist just to get used to it i wouldn't mind getting rid of him but you know you

[02:27:35.900 --> 02:27:39.560]
know you look at this team they had nine guys in the world cup so they've only had one preceasing

[02:27:39.560 --> 02:27:43.600]
together you know they so they have they need to yeah they got a lot of great talent on the team but

[02:27:43.600 --> 02:27:47.620]
they had the same a lot most of the same talent last year and he still uh they got problems believe

[02:27:47.620 --> 02:27:51.920]
me just a lot of great individuals doesn't make a great team oh well now that you're right all right

[02:27:51.920 --> 02:27:56.880]
no i thought good luck to pal okay don't need it we have an open line and brow it at seven six seven

[02:27:56.880 --> 02:28:01.960]
w i d seven six seven nine four six three you look at the panthers we know other than the b-ser we don't

[02:28:01.960 --> 02:28:06.300]
have any super super star mean right shepherd of course is a fifty goal score but you wouldn't put

[02:28:06.300 --> 02:28:11.160]
him in a same league with a messier or greetski or guys like that uh but you know you know you

[02:28:11.160 --> 02:28:15.580]
well you know great teams don't necessarily have super super stars on them to be that is in may

[02:28:16.560 --> 02:28:24.640]
here's uh hollywood hello hello yes sir uncle nil yes i am welcome to hollywood i'm the tick-tack man

[02:28:30.080 --> 02:28:36.820]
restaurants in the shopping center right west of you is floris wands and vitos and then

[02:28:37.380 --> 02:28:43.440]

[02:29:32.820 --> 02:29:36.380]
so what's the deal tonight defo is going to be coming in here that should be pretty exciting i

[02:29:36.380 --> 02:29:40.940]
think defo can probably turn on a microphone i think defo can probably come in here and sit in front

[02:29:40.940 --> 02:29:48.600]
of the uh thing is that thing hooked up at all George or is that unplugged what that mic the one

[02:29:48.700 --> 02:29:53.680]
you pulled it should but what what numbers it on how can it be plugged in can't be plugged in i had

[02:29:53.680 --> 02:30:00.000]
i you're asking me yeah but this is mic number one wouldn't that also be mic number one excuse us

[02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:05.860]
for our technical conversation folks and by the way bob greens and asshole see i'm not i'm not

[02:30:05.860 --> 02:30:10.280]
gonna unleash it all in the first day because i want to keep them under toes day by day i'm going to

[02:30:10.280 --> 02:30:13.960]
like has different things come back to my mind like the story about the first and the second vagus

[02:30:13.960 --> 02:30:18.540]
trips and various other in the sort of sundry like don't bother coming into work tomorrow because you

[02:30:18.540 --> 02:30:22.780]
didn't play a few promos i've got stories about bob green and about bob niel and about that whole

[02:30:22.780 --> 02:30:26.100]
thing about the way they blew her an area out they didn't even let them come back and say goodbye in

[02:30:26.100 --> 02:30:30.200]
the year after seventeen years the way they signed a new contract for another year and then like

[02:30:30.200 --> 02:30:35.060]
about a month later just a matter of weeks later they blew them out of there and then had to pay

[02:30:35.060 --> 02:30:38.200]
them off for a year that's good business but i wonder why they couldn't make any money with this

[02:30:38.200 --> 02:30:42.820]
station huh sign them up for another year and then oh by the way mic uh don't bother coming to work

[02:30:42.820 --> 02:30:46.100]
anymore we'll send you a check in the mail but nice knowing you thanks for the seventeen years up

[02:30:46.100 --> 02:30:52.200]
you're asked that's the cox people baby and see in their own mind i'm sure because because

[02:30:52.200 --> 02:30:57.920]
anytime there's a disagreement both parties always rationalize and justify both parties always

[02:30:57.920 --> 02:31:03.840]
believe they're right anytime there's an argument a disagreement a whatever all depending on

[02:31:03.840 --> 02:31:08.960]
their perspective so i'm sure in their minds they think that they were great to everybody but it's

[02:31:08.960 --> 02:31:14.440]
just it's just such a strange coincidence that virtually everybody everybody over the last

[02:31:14.440 --> 02:31:18.680]
goddard he knows how many years whose work for that joint uh was no good

[02:31:20.780 --> 02:31:26.320]
everybody wasn't good enough for them and sooner or later in one form or another everybody got it

[02:31:26.320 --> 02:31:32.700]
up the rectum and whether they liked it or not so that's the uh old cox way which i think there's

[02:31:32.700 --> 02:31:37.540]
a really interesting fordian uh significance that a whole deal but you finger it out here's

[02:31:37.540 --> 02:31:41.400]
plan so you got some stuff there that guy's gonna get you all hooked up he's gonna do what he can

[02:31:41.460 --> 02:31:47.380]
uh hold your breath what do you mean what do you mean by that you don't believe that tomorrow we're

[02:31:47.380 --> 02:31:51.820]
gonna have a feast in here the uh oh about today hey i'm going to my mother's and i got two

[02:31:51.820 --> 02:31:57.220]
applicants cheesecakes you're a minister you're a minister you guys though you don't see you don't

plugs if Neil gets on says oh man this is great even if it blows you know if i all then they send

[02:32:14.520 --> 02:32:22.020]

[02:32:22.020 --> 02:32:25.840]
do plantation hello hey i'm not going to get chronic on you but i had to call back because that guy

[02:32:25.840 --> 02:32:30.660]
said robot back yeah i called earlier but that guy just called said robot i was benched but he was

[02:32:30.660 --> 02:32:34.940]
injured in the third period yeah he played great this guy says he's been watching hockey for 22

[02:32:35.380 --> 02:32:39.760]
look robot i was the most dangerous player on the ice for either team in the first two periods

[02:32:39.760 --> 02:32:44.080]
he came real close to score on a couple of goals he was he was playing great well they got a

[02:32:44.080 --> 02:32:47.980]
laceration above his right ankle when he collided with screw them and somebody else by the bench

[02:32:47.980 --> 02:32:51.960]
about 11 minutes left in the third he cut his uh because i i commented we were driving home and i

[02:32:51.960 --> 02:32:55.460]
said to my friend john i said you know i wonder what happened with robot because he was he was

[02:32:55.460 --> 02:32:59.640]
scared and they held on me all night he was playing great yeah i came home and watch and this guy says

[02:32:59.640 --> 02:33:03.880]
they benched him this typical ranger fan man he talks about dealing with reality

[02:33:03.880 --> 02:33:09.560]
see what i'm talking about wannabe yeah i came home and watch it on rewind and if he was educated and

[02:33:09.560 --> 02:33:14.080]
he would watch john davidson on the rewind broadcast 11 30 he would have seen all that

[02:33:14.640 --> 02:33:18.720]

[02:49:56.350 --> 02:49:58.850]
But he's your kid looks to me like he could use it. You know what I'm saying?

[02:49:59.290 --> 02:50:04.930]
He could use it. Jimmy's a good, I mean that James a good personal friend of his and that he saw

[02:50:04.930 --> 02:50:09.090]
He feels bad that Jimmy let him go that he was a good safety and a

[02:50:09.090 --> 02:50:13.470]
He's stuck that joint out. Okay, there's no space. He couldn't have played on a girls team

[02:50:13.470 --> 02:50:18.350]
Exactly. There's no space for what's he gonna do if he doesn't play safe to why he can't do nothing on special team?

[02:50:18.710 --> 02:50:22.810]
Exactly. I mean in Keith's well, I you know, that's like when I try to make Keith buyers into a ride receiver

[02:50:22.810 --> 02:50:27.550]
It's like trying to make a chicken sandwich into a sirloin steak, you know, it just don't happen. Yeah, doesn't work

[02:50:27.550 --> 02:50:31.650]
Can I get a shame this request? Uh-oh, I think we're gonna have to fry this guy. What is it?

Practice makes perfect. That's what I've always said. That's my

[02:50:54.770 --> 02:50:58.870]
Policy and philosophy. This way till Rick Riley sits down in here. Boy, that's really gonna be special

[02:50:59.350 --> 02:51:04.330]
We have an open line in day 622 W I OD 622 W I

[02:51:05.950 --> 02:51:10.590]

[02:51:11.670 --> 02:51:15.670]
Until until Ryan and Ron get here. It's kind of it's heartbreaking. It's aggravating

[02:51:16.110 --> 02:51:18.010]
It just tears your kishkis out

[02:51:18.670 --> 02:51:23.490]
Here's a call from homestead hello. I am ill sir down here now. I'm sad all right

[02:51:23.490 --> 02:51:27.350]
Hey listen up there goalie last night played out his ass

[02:51:27.350 --> 02:51:32.270]
Glenn Healey was phenomenal last night as much as we're pissed off about it because we had about 85 breakaways

[02:51:32.270 --> 02:51:38.070]
We should add a lot of goals. He played fantastic and we give credit where credit is due Glenn Healey was God last night

[02:51:38.070 --> 02:51:44.830]
I don't like the Rangers, but I have to admire what he did and he's the backup is the is their primary any better than

[02:51:44.830 --> 02:51:46.910]
Brackham. Yeah, he's the backup. Wow

[02:51:47.530 --> 02:51:53.110]
Anyways, Vegas, but let me say this he would be the starter on a lot of other teams. Glenn Healey's he's been around

[02:51:53.110 --> 02:52:01.750]
He's a good guy. Yeah, it was incredible. I just got back in Vegas. Everybody say about it is true, but but there is a

[02:52:01.750 --> 02:52:04.190]
Sea of blue hair out there

[02:52:05.670 --> 02:52:13.590]
Village look like a kindergarten really oh my goodness and kids my little kids, you know those crumb snatchers

[02:52:13.590 --> 02:52:15.910]
Yeah, well that's because they got all the

[02:52:24.610 --> 02:52:28.950]
Yeah, right or put a stick him in the nursery at DMG. I'm grand. They've got a nursery there

[02:52:28.950 --> 02:52:33.410]
Oh my god. Is it was but it was or or I got a better idea stick him in the desert and they'll give him a map

[02:52:33.410 --> 02:52:35.110]
That would be good. That would be cool anyways

[02:52:35.110 --> 02:52:39.710]
Have a license plate on his car that says fat red. Yes, he most certainly does

[02:52:39.710 --> 02:52:41.650]
He about ran me off the road the other night

[02:52:41.650 --> 02:52:43.530]
That's that's rich like a

[02:52:43.530 --> 02:52:46.430]
Mini-air you got him. That's the guy. That's richy

[02:52:48.730 --> 02:52:55.610]
Okay pal, good luck to you. That's the fat man. You better get out of his way when he starts motoring along trust me when I tell you that one

[02:52:56.010 --> 02:53:00.350]
He isn't a big hurry, especially if he's on a way to that big circular thing up there called the track

[02:53:01.150 --> 02:53:07.070]
We have an open line on a purple line pound IOD so we got we get everything based on the rumors and reports out there

[02:53:07.070 --> 02:53:10.370]
Is everything now straightened out? I mean I always like being to get a pig

[02:53:10.370 --> 02:53:15.730]
I like to want to be coming in all inaugurating the new stuff and the thing we did over in Tampa for a week

[02:53:15.730 --> 02:53:19.630]
It's always coming in and making the announcement on the air the stations been sold

I'm always the guy that they had all the good crap to so was everything okay now everything out of control everything a okay

[02:53:27.210 --> 02:53:32.050]
Now listening to a word that I'm saying okay. I got the intercom for the back door over here, okay?

[02:53:32.790 --> 02:53:33.430]

[02:53:34.170 --> 02:53:38.730]
In the room here. Yeah, and I'm talking to somebody who's at the back door is it no idea

[02:53:39.290 --> 02:53:41.330]
But I'm sure I should talk to them. Is it food?

[02:53:43.730 --> 02:53:48.930]
Don't panic ma here here's Miami. Hello. Yeah, sir

[02:53:49.630 --> 02:53:53.030]
And back to you let me tell you something about a year and a half ago

[02:53:53.030 --> 02:53:55.270]
I'm out taking a walk and I got you on the walk man

[02:53:55.270 --> 02:53:59.110]
Yeah, and back then you were talking about a we're gonna move to Broward in this and that and oh

[02:53:59.110 --> 02:54:02.810]
That was the Cox people were threatening the move is to Broward right and look what happens?

[02:54:02.990 --> 02:54:04.610]
Are you on your brand new studios? That's right?

[02:54:04.610 --> 02:54:09.090]
We couldn't wait for them so we had a call on buddy, but I said please get us out of here and move us to a real place

[02:54:09.090 --> 02:54:15.650]
Hey tell you what since since the Harold hockey section sucks and their NF and their NHL preview thing was pretty horrible

[02:54:15.650 --> 02:54:18.810]
Yeah, well, you know about this new guy from the black hawks morrow

[02:54:20.350 --> 02:54:22.930]
Haven't seen him. Yeah, I say he did score a nice goal

[02:54:22.930 --> 02:54:27.590]
I saw the replaying at the first game black hawks for some reason they're hot even without Jeremy Redneck

[02:54:27.590 --> 02:54:31.390]
Well, they signed out him creating so that's that's not gonna put him over the top

[02:54:31.390 --> 02:54:33.470]
But they they they're off to a good start

[02:54:34.610 --> 02:54:39.430]
Could be a little help at the center though, but he scored a nice goal and at what what the hell was I think they're second game

[02:54:39.430 --> 02:54:43.090]
Five to two over the hell they beat up on oh, they beat the was it the blues?

[02:54:43.470 --> 02:54:47.190]
Well, they beat the capitals first game, but the second game now's the second game

[02:54:47.190 --> 02:54:50.870]
They beat the snot out of somebody. They're off to a damn good start. I guess it was a blues. Yeah

[02:54:52.310 --> 02:54:55.410]
Neal in closing. Yes, sir. I don't know if you have it up in the machine

[02:54:55.410 --> 02:54:58.810]
But since the Holy Father's in the hospital. Do you have the Pope's most of that?

[02:54:59.710 --> 02:55:00.510]
Do we have the Pope?

[02:55:02.390 --> 02:55:04.030]

[02:55:07.470 --> 02:55:10.670]
Thanks a lot. What is it? Are we going to electrocute these people?

[02:55:10.670 --> 02:55:14.410]
They're being very inconsiderate you know, he said if he's being nice about it

[02:55:14.410 --> 02:55:17.670]
He wasn't pushy. He didn't say play it now or your mom

[02:55:17.670 --> 02:55:19.210]
Did you understand something huh?

[02:55:19.590 --> 02:55:23.230]
Or maybe he asked for your mama. What is it did he offer to bring you something?

[02:55:24.290 --> 02:55:30.790]
He said he might show up, okay, and he also smelled over the phone. I could tell he smelled like at least partially circumcised George

[02:55:31.430 --> 02:55:39.010]
So there smarty pants. So who is it to back door anybody? We know or want the food or something huh? No just some degenerate

[02:55:39.510 --> 02:55:44.390]
Okay, just your ordinary pedestrian axe murder where she used to that we got a lot of good training on that

[02:55:44.390 --> 02:55:47.550]
So that don't bother us one forty three at W. I. O. D. La Rue

[02:55:47.550 --> 02:55:49.450]

Dammit

[02:56:03.770 --> 02:56:04.850]

He likes receivers better why

[02:56:15.510 --> 02:56:19.710]
Some people say that number eight is gay

[02:56:20.630 --> 02:56:23.190]
They say Troy loves the big brown eye

[02:56:23.950 --> 02:56:26.430]
A. C. Man

[02:56:27.390 --> 02:56:29.670]
He goes down on his knees

[02:56:29.670 --> 02:56:30.830]
Eggman

[02:56:32.330 --> 02:56:34.550]
It's guys he likes to please

[02:56:34.550 --> 02:56:35.930]
Eggman

[02:56:37.290 --> 02:56:41.770]
He loves to snap cowboys on their behind

[02:56:45.630 --> 02:56:48.030]
He's got a spotless reputation

[02:56:51.390 --> 02:56:53.470]
America's team is world renowned

[02:56:56.430 --> 02:57:00.470]
What is Troy gay? I've heard some people say

[02:57:01.630 --> 02:57:04.230]
In the heart will he goes down

[02:57:05.330 --> 02:57:06.170]
Eggman

[02:57:08.430 --> 02:57:11.530]
He goes down on his knees Eggman

[02:57:13.310 --> 02:57:16.610]
I can't some balls to squeeze Eggman

[02:57:17.790 --> 02:57:24.130]
Don't clip him cause he likes it from behind

[02:57:27.070 --> 02:57:29.710]
Okay, 148 to W. I. Let me ask you this question by the way

[02:57:29.710 --> 02:57:31.890]
This is something I should have talked about back in the beginning

[02:57:32.330 --> 02:57:38.470]
But I'm personally so overwhelmed by the fact that everybody here is so helpful and cooperative and nice to us at least on the first day anyway

[02:57:38.830 --> 02:57:43.770]
And just the packs and people are the good people the fat people are the dead people and the

[02:57:43.770 --> 02:57:48.990]
Paxen people are the good people and the Cox people mostly suck but anyway, so leaving the building yesterday

[02:57:50.030 --> 02:57:51.230]
Now I don't know about you

[02:57:51.850 --> 02:57:53.850]
But when I walked out of there at two o'clock

[02:57:53.850 --> 02:57:58.430]
I anticipated that perhaps since we were pretty sure that we were not going to be coming back

[02:57:58.430 --> 02:58:01.330]
That there might be one or two people waiting to say goodbye

[02:58:02.590 --> 02:58:05.210]
Do you know what I'm saying? There were there were sorry they missed you

[02:58:08.530 --> 02:58:11.350]
Like I would have gone up and said goodbye to Mabel in person

[02:58:11.350 --> 02:58:13.090]
But I can do that when I go to the doctor

[02:58:13.090 --> 02:58:15.610]
I can go and say goodbye to Mabel without going through those doors

[02:58:15.610 --> 02:58:18.910]
You know what I'm saying and I didn't really want to go up in that part of the building myself

[02:58:20.090 --> 02:58:21.110]
You follow what I'm saying

[02:58:21.110 --> 02:58:25.510]
Because I have a feeling that people are waiting to see if I would venture myself up there

[02:58:25.510 --> 02:58:31.110]
Which why should I do that and be insincere now who are these people that you're speaking of who we're starting long list

[02:58:31.750 --> 02:58:32.550]
such as

[02:58:33.610 --> 02:58:34.490]
Such as Mabel

[02:58:34.490 --> 02:58:40.150]
Well, I said nice things if I love Mabel. I'll say goodbye to Mabel. You know traffic and continuity department

[02:58:40.150 --> 02:58:43.210]
Yeah, Sharon and Steffi in a net right

[02:58:45.090 --> 02:58:48.550]
Yeah, and a host of others that I'm sure I'll get in trouble for forgetting

[02:58:48.550 --> 02:58:52.210]
But what about like in that other place up there through the front

[02:58:52.870 --> 02:58:56.370]
Kind of like close to where Mabel sits hot 105 no close

[02:58:57.190 --> 02:58:58.170]
Get warmer now

[02:58:58.790 --> 02:59:01.970]
So thanks to I see you're such a piece of crap George

[02:59:02.970 --> 02:59:05.970]
You didn't think I'd come through for you. I'm not even eaten here today

[02:59:05.970 --> 02:59:08.970]
I'm going to my mother's for lunch because it's Wednesday and she's right up the street

[02:59:08.970 --> 02:59:11.090]
And I want to thank Vito's

[02:59:11.090 --> 02:59:14.630]
You're you just you know I come in here. I'm old. I'm senile

[02:59:14.630 --> 02:59:18.430]
I'm like fumbling around like it'll and I'm still managed to get through this like a champion

[02:59:18.550 --> 02:59:21.990]
I got stuff here. I don't even know what the hell it's all about and I'm doing just fine

[02:59:22.710 --> 02:59:25.670]
In fact, I'm doing better than some others. Not I don't want to rub it in

[02:59:26.190 --> 02:59:27.450]
Yeah, exactly right

[02:59:28.570 --> 02:59:34.450]
And he's right you're not going to get no food in here for us. Yeah, well here's Vito's at 3373

[02:59:34.450 --> 02:59:37.910]
Sheridan Street in Hollywood Vito's sub shop in pizza delivery

[02:59:38.410 --> 02:59:43.490]
Smells great, too. It smells great. What do they bring you mr. Smarty's pick a pizza and a bag of subs

[02:59:43.490 --> 02:59:44.610]
Well, how do you like that?

[02:59:45.110 --> 02:59:49.930]
How do you like that something to tidy over until we have a real big feast in here tomorrow at two

[02:59:49.930 --> 02:59:54.170]
And what we're going to be doing to keep everybody happy including Roy who's been very nice to us

[02:59:54.170 --> 02:59:56.950]
We don't want to get him bent out of shape, which I don't think would take too much

[02:59:57.630 --> 02:59:57.990]
Uh

[02:59:59.630 --> 03:00:03.870]
We don't want to press him too far so to speak exactly, but um

[03:00:04.370 --> 03:00:08.290]
We'll have we'll have him bring stuff in around a little before two and then we'll have our little thing out there

[03:00:08.290 --> 03:00:10.170]
It'll be a beautiful thing. It'll be great

[03:00:10.970 --> 03:00:12.610]

Yeah, it's not like I've learned so no, George is giving me like a sign like your number one. Let me just say this okay

[03:01:57.270 --> 03:01:58.850]
He sounds a little snooty today

[03:01:58.850 --> 03:02:02.430]
He's noody in there because he's having technical problems and he's old fossil in here

[03:02:02.430 --> 03:02:06.030]

Something like that and now you know something now the real work starts because this is a massive project

[03:02:27.630 --> 03:02:29.010]
We've had no leadership whatsoever

[03:02:29.010 --> 03:02:32.970]
I don't want to mention from programming, but it's kind of been like a do-it-yourself project

[03:02:33.530 --> 03:02:38.850]
And now that we're finally in here now it's gonna be like day after day and night after night

[03:02:38.850 --> 03:02:42.270]
