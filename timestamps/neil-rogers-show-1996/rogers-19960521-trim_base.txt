How did we get these we got a whole bunch of these but our I guess we're supposed to be there too

Okay right in the middle of the show. Maybe we can carry an incimal chase it and put it on your 11 o'clock tomorrow

[00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.600]
So the rumor is should I tell him what the rumor is or not?

[00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:09.400]
huh

[00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.720]
Should I tell him the rumors that we're going to

[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.760]
WI on

[00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:23.000]
I mean these rumors have been going on and on and on and on

[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.720]
Odd infant item for months and months and months and of course everybody whose livelihood is in a balance

[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.320]
We're just a little pions, you know

[00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.880]
We just hanging around waiting for the shoot to drop have I been telling that for months?

[00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:41.520]
And so now the deal allegedly is that we're buying some FM's in the market and we're gonna put our format all of us are moving over to FM and

[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:49.060]
What some of us and that Paxton is buying the frequency 6 10 a.m. And they're gonna put the light bulb on

[00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.760]
610 WFTL which quite frankly

[00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.760]
They're still gonna have the same 400 old people listening, but at least they'll be able to hear a little bit better

[00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.300]
They won't have to turn up their miracle. You're quite so loud

[00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.820]
So that's the rumor as of this moment and stay tuned to Mars tomorrow's gonna be the big day

[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.000]
Tomorrow's the day all the shoes drop

[00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.960]
Here's a lady in dear field be chillow can you know? Yes, ma'am?

[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.940]
I'll give her the first time on Friday. Uh-huh. How was it?

[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:21.160]
You're producer asked me the same thing. Well, we try to please I told him my hands shook for the first couple minutes

[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.800]
We talk

[00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.560]
Anyway, um about the panthers

[00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.520]
One last and everybody's dropping off the pan wax

[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.080]
Yeah, you ought to see this phone right now

[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.660]
And what really depresses me is that everybody came back last night the team is back the coaches are back

[00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:40.700]
Everybody is back in town even the broadcasters are back and now I'm sitting here today and the yesterday was a field

[00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:46.960]
They all I had to do was sit down and say where is everybody and they all appear and they're all enthusiastic and they were singing their songs and

[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:51.760]
Doing their poetry and we lose one game and now it's like same old crap again. Yeah, well

[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.640]
We've been with this town cannot keep it up. I'll tell you that right now

[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.740]
This town is important it cannot keep it up

[00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:03.180]
Well, we've been with the panthers for all three years. They've been here and we were waiting yesterday to hear

[00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.260]
You know somebody asked you where they're coming in at the airport right and my husband called Jeff

[00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.040]
Moss yesterday to try and find out and Jeff wouldn't tell him did you ever find out?

[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.880]
No, he wouldn't tell us either where he's and we're not on his friendly list anymore

[00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.540]
Now that now that you don't need us because all the playoff tickets of course you can't buy for love or money

[00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.180]
Now that they don't need us anymore

[00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.960]
We can't don't hear a word from Jeff Moss or any of our good friends over there at the Panther office

[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.180]
Well, see we would have really enjoyed who our real friends are now

[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.080]
Yeah, I mean, you know, so they lost last night. It was still a good game

[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:39.580]
They had a good game. That's right. They had a lot of good chances and and you stole my line about the five goals

[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.360]
Right, I said four to one. It was three to two. It still adds up to five

[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.840]
That's right if you're playing over an unders baby. I gave it to you right on the nose

[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.980]
Yeah, well, I'm happy with the split. I wasn't gonna get greedy about it

[00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.480]
You were saying four one yesterday my husband was saying two nothing and I wasn't saying anything

[00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.840]
I thought well we got seven games that we might have to play here

[00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.860]
So we'll take them one at a time and

[00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.960]
You know that's it and I'm sorry that we have to watch on ESPN

[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:10.780]
But we don't have a dish so we don't have the option of CBC. Well it goes to show it's you know

[00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.540]
You got to have a dish well you want an idea of how bad ESPN is the first game

[00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.220]
They're talking about rep Warner

[00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:22.220]
They got his name up on the screen and who have they got the name in front of Paul laws nice

[00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:23.060]
Yeah

[00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.060]
Seriously and they never came back and corrected it either

[00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:30.100]
So pretty tough to tell those two apart the Paul's got a real nice mustache

[00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:39.900]
But did you see the thing in the sunset know about him going to get a tire no at a tire store no

[00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.380]
And he gave the guy a day. Oh, yeah, I did see that yeah

[00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:43.520]
Yeah, yeah

[00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:45.920]
Look look big enough to be a hockey player

[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:49.360]
Yeah, and then the guy had the ball to ask him for playoff tickets

[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:54.440]
Yeah, of course of course that's right all you got to do is tell somebody you know somebody you once

[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.120]
Ran into somebody in a supermarket that knew somebody with a panthers right away. Oh you got some tickets

[00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:04.340]
Yeah, yeah, well, I'm glad we got tickets because I sure don't want to watch it game on Fox on Sunday

[00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:09.340]
Oh God forbid I'm gonna see that fuck that purple people leader thing on air forget it

[00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:14.720]
Well, you know, you ought to do a survey of your listeners and get a you know get a pull of like everybody that hates it

[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.900]
And then the fuck no they don't they don't care

[00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.680]
They you know Fox are the most arrogant bastards. They just made up their mind that they're gonna

[00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.480]
We inflict that on the audience. They don't they know that everybody hates it

[00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.200]
But Sandy Grossman and that crowd they don't care well

[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:29.800]
They know we all hate Mike Amherick too, but they don't care. They're gonna force him on us too

[00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:35.460]
Well, isn't it also Fox it wants to have the three periods changed to four quarters. Yeah, hold your breath guys

[00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.540]
Oh, hold your breath. I mean talk about

[00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:41.020]
Scrooing around with a perfect game talk about reinventing anything for their own

[00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.500]
Expeediancy, okay, they can stick it up their ass

[00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:50.500]
Seriously while you hang in there Neil really enjoy talking to and I enjoy listening. Okay, okay

[00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:54.340]
See you. Bye. Bye. We have an open line and Broward 524 tomorrow

[00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:58.740]
It's a good thing we got let's eat and I we got the Red Wings and the Colorado of course tomorrow night is Wednesday

[00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:02.880]
That means Pompadot Park. I'll be there rich just calm down just take a take a chill

[00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:08.220]
But tomorrow is gonna be a gigantic day in the history of the radio industry in this market

[00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:11.800]
I'm not making this up. This is not the Phil Henry show. I'm not feeding your line. All right. I

[00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:17.500]
Yep, it's the real thing. It's the Emma's tomorrow is gonna be a gigantic humongous

[00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.940]
We're having stuff going on over here, which we don't know what it is

[00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:24.000]
We have a lot of rumors still going on and then Paxton's having his press conference at 11

[00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:27.900]
Which is convenient because that's after we're gonna find out whatever's going on over here

[00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:31.840]
And then we're gonna be on here spilling the beans all over the goddamn place and who knows

[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:36.660]
How fast is this gonna happen by the way if it's what we think it is do we know we're getting any rumors on that

[00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:38.520]
Like maybe by Thursday

[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:41.980]
Now what are you laughing about we want off?

[00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:49.420]
AM okay, we want off this goddamn RK being on AM is worse than being on shortwave at least shortwave travels a long distance

[00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:51.320]
I mean like over the whole goddamn continent

[00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:53.840]
But being on AM is like

[00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:57.020]
Jesus it's like we're in Nickers

[00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:03.960]
And the fact that we get the numbers that we do being on AM where you have to go out and just poke just poke people in the brain and say

[00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:09.740]
Hey, guess what if you're under the age of a hundred there's something called AM radio and it's not just for all religion and Haitian music or whatever

[00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:16.020]
And of course isn't it always great when you're like especially on a day like today when it's raining and when there's storms in the atmosphere

[00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:18.520]
That's always good on AM that makes for real good listening

[00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:22.420]
Like that we love being on AM, right?

[00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:25.620]
Who's the guy when he went on Zeta one morning the first day?

[00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:28.240]
I told you AM was dead that was like nine years ago

[00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:33.460]
And there've been a couple of us on here resuscitating and pumping and breathing life into it over these last few years

[00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:38.360]
Just to try to keep it just to keep a pulse level going on there and pulse went out of business long before our

[00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:39.260]
Bertron ever came along

[00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:44.780]
Yes, you don't even know what that is do you Mr. Hatchout pulse used to be the radio rating service?

[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:47.300]
How do you like that pulse that was the name of it?

[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:50.360]
And then they said well, we don't want no pulse in Miami because they don't have one

[00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:56.420]
It's 1113 at W I O D on the big Wednesday show and how from home improvement all right

[00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:59.940]
He's gonna be here to tell us apparently there's new battery recycling program

[00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:03.900]
And I know what he's gonna say just throw him in the canal, you know

[00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:08.060]
Make him into a topping for the ice cream for kids, you know, go ahead do it

[00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:09.780]
Damn, we'll let you know if you were right tomorrow

[00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:13.440]
Rick and said 6 to 10 a.m. on news talk at entertainment radio

[00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:15.480]
16 W I O D

[00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:15.960]
Ha

[00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:18.960]
Okay, I just figured out what's gonna happen tomorrow, but I can't tell you

[00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:26.000]
But I think it has to do with Tampa and with here and with buddy Bud Pax is buying this frequency

[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.120]
610 W I O D not this station not the on the air stuff

[00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:34.480]
But the frequent the signal this place 610 and it's perfect for him

[00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:37.980]
He's used to having like 0.5s and all of his properties look at INZ in the light bulb

[00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:42.380]
So we can turn this into a 0.5 probably within two or three months in one book. He can do that

[00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:45.260]
Here's a mobile in cocoa

[00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:46.960]
Hello, Uncle Vio

[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:52.020]
Yes, sir, if you go to have them we will not be able to hear you anymore. Oh, damn it

[00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:55.440]
And if people up here in Brevard County, Florida cocoa Beach

[00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:59.960]
Cape Canaveral tightest still them Melbourne all listen to you. Well

[00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:02.600]
What can I tell you

[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:06.280]
Taxes and did the goat to WTTO up here. What do you do?

[00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:13.120]
Go into all sports news. Yeah, and then it's his four it's worse than it was when it was oldy

[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:17.320]
That's that's buddy Bud. This guy couldn't program his way out of a wet paper bag

[00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:22.160]
He's got the mightest touch in reverse everything he touches turns to what Mario was doing last night

[00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:26.440]
Yeah, I would say so and I'm really really kind of concerned

[00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:31.860]
And 610 is one of the only really good signals out of Miami that you can hear actual programming on it

[00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:36.180]
That you don't have to defend a far like yeah, well, you know black and white TV used to be pretty good too

[00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:37.920]
But things have to move on you know

[00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:41.340]
Well, we're gonna miss you well, you'll have to move a little bit, you know

[00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:47.080]
I have to move down to Palm Beach County. Oh, yeah, well, I guess to get any of the FM we will yeah

[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:51.180]
All right, good luck. Okay, nice knowing your pal. See ya

[00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:55.180]
He'll be they'll be glued to it and of course up in Orlando. It'll be the same thing, right?

[00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:58.320]
All our pyzons up there that sit under high tension wires

[00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:03.200]
Just so they can hear the goddamn station and they're under a lot of high tension while they're listening just like we are

[00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:10.120]
Sitting under those power lines just shaking in their boots hanging on every word waiting for the next asshole to come along

[00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:14.980]
Oh, can you imagine that if they don't hear the word asshole and they'll have to move into sunny foxes house

[00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:17.820]
Not so they can hear the word just so they can see one

[00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:23.320]
Hi, this is sunny fox. I listen to your Rogers because I can hear the word asshole. There you go get your FM cranked up again, sunny

[00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:27.460]
So I don't know I you know, we're just guessing all we're doing is just

[00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:29.960]
Speculating and speculating or repeating many of the rumors

[00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:36.040]
But I do think that I got my finger on a pulse of this thing that there's gonna be a major swap here involving one company in town

[00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:37.080]
Plus cocks

[00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:42.280]
involving some of our stations over there in Tampa, which I'm sure we would love to dump out of that toilet and

[00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:44.300]
And this thing this turkey

[00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:50.720]
Kind of like a three-way deal here. You know what I'm saying like they're spinning off this and spinning off of that like a dreidel

[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:53.300]
It's kind of a dreidel deal. This one is spinning around over here

[00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:56.040]
And we're spinning around over there and who the hell knows what's going on

[00:10:56.040 --> 00:11:01.140]
But tomorrow the shoes are gonna drop even a Hansel and Gretel never saw shoes like this even in Holland

[00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:03.720]
They never saw wouldn't shoes like this and wouldn't nickels

[00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:12.940]
Here's a bokeh. Hello. Yeah, sir. How's it going today great good. I have a question for you. Okay last night's a game

[00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:14.860]
Am I mistaken did I happen to see

[00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:18.300]
Yager in the spotlight when he was going towards in that yeah, you know

[00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:21.200]
Chris Cuthbert made a cost to comment about that they put you know

[00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:23.660]
They put the spotlight on after the penguin score a goal

[00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:27.740]
They put it on the player and Cuthbert says you know, it's great to have the big players in the spotlight

[00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:30.460]
But you guys are gonna have to wait until after they scored to do it, you know

[00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:37.080]
It's so cheesy. Yeah, like what is this stuff? What's going on pretty bush league? Yeah, uh, and what about that hit by bezer?

[00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:39.920]
Yeah, go back to the go that was sweet

[00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:43.420]
Something he had every right to be going back in there was that's a lensky

[00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:48.540]
Smolensky was keeping him out of the goal. He's trying to get back in a crease which is his that's his domain

[00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:52.560]
I'm nearly I agree one of them he wants up getting the guy damn penalty, which is bull crap

[00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:58.860]
I'm kind of Andy Von Hellman is the worst referee in a history of the sport and ugly at hell and he makes me sick to my stomach

[00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:00.460]
He's okay, he blows

[00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:04.540]
Hey, you might have thought someone to do's back. Please. Joe Darsie your

[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:09.500]
Okay, see ya. Okay, there's a guy that's very he's perspicacious

[00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:13.460]
He's on top of it and if any of the Panthers are listening including Jody Hull's wife right now

[00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:18.300]
We love all you guys and your wives and your families and your boyfriends and whoever the hell it is

[00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:24.600]
Everybody from top to bottom. Bezer was great again last night Billy Lindsay even Garper Lafayne a neat little pastor on it

[00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:27.040]
Lindsay goal and uh, what can you say?

[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.520]
But you know, so we lost the game and I'm not I'm not one of those people that just gets all sour and p.o

[00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:39.100]
And you know starts turning like some of you bastards out there if you don't win every goddamn game

[00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:41.500]
That's because we got a lot of very synthetic support out there

[00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:46.400]
We got a lot of front running phonies and we'll scrape those bastards away in the real fans those who've really gotten into this

[00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:49.540]
They'll they'll be right there. They'll be riding it so to speak

[00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:54.900]
Here's for Lauderdale on the purple line. Hello. Hey Neil. Yes, sir. How's it going great?

[00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:57.560]
I have a statement a comment and a question. Okay

[00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:59.880]
Let's hear the statement my statement

[00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:01.440]
I love

[00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:05.740]
Indy car and NASCAR and hockey and I'd rather pick up truck. Oh boy

[00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:12.700]
Well, you got all the bases covered I guess. Yeah my comment. Yeah is the panthers are awesome, man

[00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:18.780]
Yeah, they are you turn me on this hockey stuff and and I was sitting there last night squirming in the couch like you wouldn't believe

[00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:21.900]
I mean my underwear is where I was riding. Yep

[00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:25.460]
I was changing my underwear almost as many times as mario last night

[00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:30.140]
I was talking to my cousin last night. There's nothing more exciting than when the puck is like

[00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:32.540]
Eight feet in front of the net and just sitting there

[00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:35.400]
Yeah, and these guys are fighting for it and you're like where's it gonna go in?

[00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:38.260]
You see there in the first period when we get all those good chances and brass

[00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.380]
Was down and out and the puck is going through the crease

[00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:43.680]
It's just missing going in the quarter and if we could just lower

[00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:47.320]
He's trying to get a hold of it and shepherds trying to get a stick on and they just couldn't bang it in there

[00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:51.860]
We had so many good chances in that first period, but hey at least we made it exciting. Yeah, that was unbelievable

[00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:53.900]
And that second goal

[00:13:54.960 --> 00:14:00.460]
I'm not too familiar with all the guys names, but and we stand there and eat deflected it in Lindsay. Yeah, unbelievable beauty

[00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:05.480]
That was unbelievable nice soft pass by Garper Law and Lindsay you stuck it right between where assos legs

[00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:08.020]
There was a beautiful thing unbelievable. Am I question this?

[00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:13.700]
Because I'm not too keen on this hockey stuff and I'm not gonna ask you all these questions about it good

[00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:17.440]
But when they're doing the face off right? What's going on?

[00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:20.000]
Which to ref retell these guys to move out or move in? I mean

[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.180]
Why because they have to be outside the phase the the circle they have to be you know

[00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:25.300]
And they have to stay still

[00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:29.380]
I can't like start moving in there to try to get the advantage and if uh and of course some of the lines

[00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:33.980]
But you know face offs should be routine and they should just drop the damn puck and get it over with

[00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:36.560]
But some of these lines been they want to be the stars of the game

[00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:40.180]
They want the limelight and so they want to make a big deal out of it and that pisses me off

[00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:43.860]
It slows down the game it gets everybody bent out of shape and there's no need for it

[00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:46.120]
I'm sitting there and it's like okay drop the puck

[00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:51.060]
Right then he looks up at him and then the guy skates out and then I find myself when I'm screaming at a game

[00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:54.860]
I find half of the screaming. I do it the lines been drop it already you asshole

[00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:58.940]
You know that's just drop it and get it over with let's get the game going and the thing about it is

[00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:03.000]
The three games that I went to this year man when they start a game they start man

[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.220]
They don't do any crap in around in the beginning with all this other hoop blus start

[00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:12.640]
I mean the game is like going. I said you're not paying attention man forget it and kneel your god and go panthers

[00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:14.500]
All right, see ya see ya

[00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:19.080]
Yeah, we're in good shape now. We're in good shape by Friday Gordon Murphy or let ankle be getting a little bit better

[00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:23.860]
I noticed yet kind of a tough time skating last night. He'll be all right plus the ice was real bad in there

[00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:29.580]
97 degrees in Pittsburgh yesterday and the puck was bouncing around like a basketball and at that mice in the

[00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:32.940]
Igloo I thought any in igloo it's supposed to be a pretty god damn cold

[00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:37.380]
You know what I'm saying 97 degrees in town pretty weak ice up there for a place that talks a big game

[00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:40.760]
Especially that big mouth stand severed on sports beat last night

[00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:44.780]
Stand I want to tell you something you're okay, but you're gonna be sleeping with the fishes you keep that crap up

[00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:48.200]
Show us a little bit of god damn respect will you please mr. hot shot

[00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:50.560]

Folks, I'd like to see a song about

[00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:35.660]
About me

[00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:41.920]
About you about the way our American hearts being way down a bottom of our chest

[00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:44.960]
About that special feeling we get in the

[00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:49.020]
Into the goals of the contest maybe in the subcontinent

[00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:50.920]
Maybe in the liver

[00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:54.460]
Maybe even in the cold

[00:16:58.780 --> 00:16:59.360]
The

[00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:07.400]
Superb and I

[00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:20.460]
It's house where the nice hardwood floor my wife and my job my kids in my car

[00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:23.760]
I'll feed on my table and a huge

[00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:30.100]
But sometimes it's just

[00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:46.000]
No, I've got to go out and have fun and someone else's expense. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I try really

[00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:48.820]
In the olds for fast lane

[00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:49.340]
Well

[00:17:49.340 --> 00:18:03.300]
I used public toilets

[00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:09.420]
I walk around in the summer times and I'm about to see

[00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:10.780]
I'm on a show

[00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:26.200]
Sometimes I'm in the handicap spaces while handicaps people make handicaps the faces

[00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:27.420]
I'm on a show

[00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:31.600]
I'm on a show

[00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:38.620]
I should be singing this song

[00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:42.580]
Renting and raising and carrying on

[00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:45.880]
Maybe they're right for they tell me

[00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:51.580]
I'm gonna

[00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:10.840]
With the whales in a hopper cats in all other cow in here here in big brown, baby

[00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:24.480]
Sunfighter-gradeable styrofoam containers and when I'm done sucking down those three small burgers

[00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:29.300]
I'm gonna wipe my mom for the American flag and then I'm gonna cross the styrofoam containers right on the side

[00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:32.420]
And really god damn thing anybody can do about it. You know why?

[00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:34.620]
Because we got the bomb that's why

[00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:41.080]
I do words, nuclear, and weapons of days Russia, Germany, Romania, they can have all the democracy they want

[00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:44.200]
They can have a big democracy, they can walk right through the middle of the enemy square

[00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:46.940]
And it won't make a lick of difference because we ain't got the bomb

[00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:49.760]
So, guys, John Wayne's not dead, he's frozen

[00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:52.740]
And as soon as we find a cure for cancer, we're gonna throw out the dougs

[00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:53.860]
And he's gonna be pretty pissed off

[00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:54.420]
You know why?

[00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:55.900]
The door's taken a cold shower

[00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:57.900]
We'll multiply that by 15 million times

[00:19:57.900 --> 00:19:59.560]
That's how pissed off the dougs can evade

[00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:01.380]
I'm gonna get a dougs, he can John get some meddies

[00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:03.260]
And leave arm and name the Sam's that can't go

[00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:05.300]
And erase a word, he's been tried down a taxi

[00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:07.320]
You know you really aren't at all

[00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:10.280]
they travel like a burning flame

[00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:13.040]
we see them slide the fucky inside

[00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:15.040]
it's a one one hockey game

[00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:17.040]
we're trying to get back in the center

[00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:18.500]
we've won him back

[00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:21.300]
we checked by dinner

[00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:23.000]
able to keep the puck in

[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:23.840]
for a summer

[00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:26.800]
we're getting ready to shot out the frame

[00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:28.200]
to speed it through

[00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:30.960]
team screening wins

[00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:32.080]
for the rules

[00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:34.340]
another first ever

[00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:39.500]
and the Stanley Cup is all filled up for the champs who win the drink

[00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:42.340]
now the final slick of the hockey stick

[00:33:42.340 --> 00:33:44.160]
and the one gigantic stream

[00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:45.820]
the puck is in

[00:33:45.820 --> 00:33:48.840]
the home team wins the good ol hockey game

[00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:49.660]
you're as foldable

[00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:50.940]
for quit on a half horse

[00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:53.480]
and the puck is in the back

[00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:53.880]
with the puck

[00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:54.800]
one huge second

[00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:57.300]
and the one here

[00:33:58.040 --> 00:33:59.620]
and it was a get into the court

[00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:00.180]
you're surprised

[00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:02.360]
a weightless opponent

[00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:03.360]
bleached his back

[00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:04.880]
shot hand in

[00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:06.320]
and the passers lead

[00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:07.560]
one turn on the

[00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:09.920]
home team

[00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:11.720]
is the best game

[00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:12.760]
you can name

[00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:14.120]
and the best game

[00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:15.180]
you can name

[00:34:15.180 --> 00:34:18.520]
is the good ol hockey game

[00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:18.860]
come on

[00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:19.220]
come on

[00:34:19.220 --> 00:34:26.560]
we got to keep the spirit

[00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:27.920]
going here next couple of days

[00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:30.280]
we got this little drought between now and the Friday

[00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:32.020]
I was starting to say we got tonight Detroit

[00:34:32.020 --> 00:34:33.660]
and Colorado in Detroit

[00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:35.500]
and

[00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:38.400]
and then tomorrow we got a little bit of a respite there

[00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:39.880]
and Thursday they play game three

[00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:41.700]
and then Friday of course is the first game here

[00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:46.820]
going to be the best game

[00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:47.480]
and then tomorrow

[00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:51.540]
we got an inflow

[00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:52.320]
andже

[00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:52.320]

[00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:52.320]

[00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:56.020]
i love it

[00:34:56.020 --> 00:34:56.900]
away

[00:34:56.900 --> 00:34:57.260]
right

[00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:00.700]
I went to italy

[00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:01.820]
I went to Rome and Milan

[00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:02.480]
and once

[00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:11.000]
buttered

[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:11.400]
air

[00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:15.180]
this country in your favor in mind last bag is alright and uh...

[00:35:15.180 --> 00:35:18.340]
which we try to get a bunch of people together to go down to the sports book to

[00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:19.040]
watch the

[00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:22.280]
the final game in the pantas flyer series

[00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:26.360]
and basically had a bag the uh... like the bartenders in the mirage to turn

[00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:29.080]
it on because he was saying everybody was there to watch the bulls in the

[00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:29.360]
next

[00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:31.400]
and they were going to dominate the tv screen

[00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:33.300]
why not my in the sports book

[00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:37.620]
yeah they had they had to be kidding me mgm grand they got everything going

[00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:40.580]
to sports book i mean uh... they got so many different screens they got every

[00:35:40.580 --> 00:35:42.080]
single thing in a world going in there

[00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:45.480]
well they had it on one big screen up by the ceiling but it was so far away

[00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:48.360]
and people were packed down there so we kind of set up by the bar but as it

[00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:51.680]
turned out we got a tv turned on here on the street before all of a sudden

[00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:54.920]
done we had about twenty people uh... you know lined up around us watching the

[00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:56.800]
same game for the panther so is a good time

[00:35:57.420 --> 00:36:00.480]
and i'm just wondering how crazy was the media friends down here after the

[00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:02.840]
go after the crash was at anything like hurricane andrew

[00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:06.380]
there what do you mean wasn't there still on the heaven they had a heaven let up

[00:36:06.380 --> 00:36:10.160]
for a second every time they find another fiber every time they find another

[00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:12.200]
here every time they find anything man

[00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:14.440]
it's uh... they're hyperventilating

[00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:18.940]
they have like extended newscast and everything almost almost nonstop

[00:36:18.940 --> 00:36:22.500]
it had happened on a saturday and i was we were still in europe at the time in

[00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:25.720]
italy right and then we came back on monday and by that time they were like

[00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:28.740]
in full force on this thing it's like uh... fifteen out of the twenty four hours

[00:36:28.740 --> 00:36:29.800]
now they're on top of it

[00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:33.560]
but i mean you know obviously it's a big story but the big story is the the

[00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:36.280]
safety aspect and the whole thing with value jet in the f a

[00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:39.640]
the story is not you know how many body parts are they going to find her

[00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:43.180]
all this other crap right now we were in the well we were traveling with

[00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:44.100]
it happened basically

[00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:47.480]
i'm sad that we got a third time and currently that the crash is had to be

[00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:50.460]
right when they take a good not watching a lot of tv and vegas

[00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:54.660]
but uh... i think that the freaky part about it is in uh... in europe

[00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:58.540]
you know they not only have seen international but they got the nbc super

[00:36:58.540 --> 00:37:02.800]
channel and the bbc and all of them were taking life feeds from stations down

[00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:06.320]
here including especially channel seven really which you know here you go

[00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:09.280]
on vacation to try to get as far away as possible and still can get away from

[00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:11.140]
the rich and she's world wide rick

[00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:15.120]
and if you got the sun sent them their up h eight a and editorial

[00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:16.780]

oj sentence never to be free

[00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:20.880]
really

[00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:24.960]
you know some sort of an intellectual penhead from cancels city might be worse

[00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:28.340]
but we're reading are they serious or is it like uh... sarcastic

[00:37:28.340 --> 00:37:30.680]
now it's like that you know you're reading and i'm

[00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:34.240]

was it richard nixon you know become on the

[00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:45.200]
junk on uh... dealer you know i think this guy's got it backwards i think the

[00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:48.280]
public has been sentenced never to be free from oj we can't get away from the

[00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:50.660]
son of a bitch every day his pusses on a rig and now

[00:37:50.660 --> 00:37:51.300]
exactly

[00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:53.880]
and uh... anglis on a mountain also where's he gonna go next

[00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:55.680]
you'll find some sucker somewhere

[00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:57.440]
right now maybe the air is all taken

[00:37:57.440 --> 00:37:58.560]
have a good one go pan

[00:37:58.560 --> 00:37:58.980]
okay

[00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:03.220]
so anyway it's eleven fifty eight a w i d we're all kind of breathless around

[00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:05.960]
here anything uh... any updates since we last book anybody running up and

[00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:09.720]
on a hallway hyperventilating and quiet for a good five minutes in a row

[00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:13.000]
are we had five that's that's the bulletin now it's been quite for five minutes

[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.700]
we haven't found any body parts here in the building in last five minutes

[00:38:16.420 --> 00:38:19.560]
but there are definitely people who are like uh... you know jumping off the

[00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:22.940]
top of channel seven or people just climbing the i.o.d. tower back here right

[00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:23.880]
now as we speak

[00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:28.640]
and uh... it's just amazing that tomorrow finally finally after all these

[00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:34.340]
weeks and months of pop up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up

[00:38:34.340 --> 00:38:36.820]
finally might find out what the hell is going on around his joint

[00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:40.240]
and wouldn't be kind of like a breath because you know i got to be honest with

[00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:43.140]
there's a certain amount of stagnation that you go through in this business

[00:38:43.140 --> 00:38:46.060]
no matter how well you're doing or how long you've been somewhere in fact a

[00:38:46.060 --> 00:38:48.700]
longer you've been there the more stagnant things become

[00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:52.340]
you know what i'm saying i mean we're stagnating here all we do have our

[00:38:52.340 --> 00:38:56.600]
fax machine back if anybody wants to try it out seven five eight w i o d

[00:38:56.600 --> 00:39:00.840]
i thought we would just wait to get the fax machine back until we change the

[00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:03.480]
whatever it had that would be another good excuse we don't want to run no

[00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:06.440]
advertising no promotion for you guys because there's something works we don't

[00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:09.500]
know what it is we can't tell you we're not really sure but uh... yeah well

[00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:12.740]
that'll be all over as of tomorrow they'll have to a pony up with some money

[00:39:12.740 --> 00:39:14.060]
and start doing something somewhere

[00:39:14.060 --> 00:39:18.760]
but that and that guy that faxed me the you know you're a cool one also if i need

[00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:22.620]
to refax that because it didn't come out in the old machine but they fixed it

[00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:25.000]
you know you're a cuban asshole if yes

[00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:29.780]
and what that what is that long if you needed the model plan that you know you're

[00:39:29.780 --> 00:39:33.100]
a model quantity of is that it yes stuff like that i needed pass it out to my

[00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:36.660]
family make about a hundred copies and james brown is not a mighty cool by the way

[00:39:36.660 --> 00:39:40.240]
that's uh... that is disgusting what kind of a comment is that a little richer

[00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:41.900]
does it hurt little rich you did is a mighty cool

[00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:46.700]
so anyway it all depends on which is so level you put the emphasis on so like I

[00:39:46.700 --> 00:39:49.740]
said the more buddy but passing hold on a press conference we got stuff going

[00:39:49.740 --> 00:39:52.560]
on over here which we can talk about because it says not for broadcast on the

[00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:56.300]
or not to read the memo we can just make you know we can just allude with the fact

[00:39:56.300 --> 00:39:59.480]
that maybe a tomorrow somebody's going to be it fact if i were one of you guys

[00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:02.260]
here i would bring in several changes of underwear tomorrow just like my

[00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:03.480]
real did in the game last night

[00:40:04.020 --> 00:40:07.260]
and you know when you come down to the myriot thing the fact that he was taken a

[00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:09.820]
dump for those ten minutes that he had the stomach flu and he was like taking

[00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:13.700]
gigantic he had the cramps without the m just stop and think about how many of

these athletes to go out to play a game for two and a half three hours stop and

[00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:20.640]
ask yourself uh... you know if some of them can't hold it every now and then

[00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:23.120]
you know what i'm saying just stop and visualize that right here lunch

[00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:26.500]

[00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:30.400]

[00:50:26.580 --> 00:50:32.200]
penalty killing we didn't do too good on the face offs last night no but again one we did and i

[00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:35.280]
think that's the key of the three and we also didn't do too good on the penalty killing two of

[00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:39.720]
their three goals were power play goals that's right and then we were over five so we have to

[00:50:39.720 --> 00:50:44.040]
improve and and screwed we got an early penalty which i didn't like by the way yeah all right yeah

[00:50:44.040 --> 00:50:47.980]
screwy's been when when he's good he's great and when he's uh you know what i'm saying about him

[00:56:17.250 --> 00:56:21.730]
guessing at this point there and so many rumors flying around and circulating it's been like

[00:56:21.730 --> 00:56:27.030]
uh like a nut house here for about six months now and evidently finally tomorrow is d-day

will it still be called w-i-o-d oh my god well it might be called w-i-o-d

[00:56:50.090 --> 00:56:53.930]
so why did they do this you have these great ratings or did they just get the rating

[00:56:53.930 --> 00:56:58.150]
oh well we would we think it's so we would much rather be on no they're not going to sell the um

[00:56:59.010 --> 00:57:02.810]
they might sell the frequency which is 6'10 but they're not going to sell the property do you

[00:57:02.810 --> 00:57:06.610]
understand what i'm saying other words all the programming that's on w-i-o-d we would just if

[00:57:06.610 --> 00:57:10.210]
this is what's going to happen we would just move it all under with f-m which anybody in their

[00:57:10.210 --> 00:57:15.050]
right mind would rather be on f-m with all due respect to our friends in marathon and cocoa beach

[00:57:15.050 --> 00:57:19.130]
you know what they have for a station here it is so right wing i thought i was listening to

[00:57:19.130 --> 00:57:23.910]

[00:59:28.650 --> 00:59:32.210]
from head to toe look at that they're they're involved in a love lock in there

[00:59:32.770 --> 00:59:36.610]
but anyway maybe they're just having a party in each other's pants because of this big announcement

[00:59:36.610 --> 00:59:41.170]
that's coming around we all know what it's about don't we i don't know here's a lady in plantation

[00:59:41.170 --> 00:59:50.010]
hello hi i'm a big stand-up viewers and hockey great wanted to ask a favor okay that song that you have

[00:59:50.010 --> 00:59:54.430]
so you played a little while ago it's like going for the dream or whatever the the dream uh

[00:59:54.430 --> 00:59:59.250]
with the chance may never come again right right could i could you let me know when you're going to

[00:59:59.250 --> 01:00:04.090]
play it again so i could record it how about if i play it as five after one when we come back after

[01:00:04.090 --> 01:00:08.290]
the news how would that be that would be great i think that would be excellent timing and everybody

[01:00:08.290 --> 01:00:11.550]
can turn it up real loud and open the windows in their house and rolled on the windows in their

[01:00:11.550 --> 01:00:16.050]
car and we can all like dance and jump up it down and and y'all we're gonna take the puck right

[01:00:16.610 --> 01:00:22.570]
what i want to ask you they never play that as a game no that's from the cbc it's a Canadian thing

[01:00:22.570 --> 01:00:26.410]
i understand and let me let me tell you what i want the whole audience to know that i've offered

[01:00:26.410 --> 01:00:30.030]
this not that i own the rights to it or anything or that i discovered it i guess i discovered it

[01:00:30.030 --> 01:00:36.130]
down here because i watch all the cbc but i suggested to rimmer last week i says how about if they

[01:00:36.130 --> 01:00:42.130]
got from the cbc the video uh and they showed it at the arena before the game you know because it

[01:00:42.130 --> 01:00:46.510]
because the video is much better than just hearing the audio i mean the video that goes with it is

[01:00:46.510 --> 01:00:50.710]
great you know it's got clips of all the teams that are still in the playoffs like the panthers and

[01:00:50.710 --> 01:00:57.830]
the red ridden and so on huh no and i suggested that they played before the panther game on friday and

[01:00:57.830 --> 01:01:01.370]
rimmer said he would tell it to the appropriate people with the panthers and they all love the idea

[01:01:01.370 --> 01:01:05.530]
but whether they're gonna do it or not that's another story and i suggest very strongly that they do

[01:01:05.530 --> 01:01:09.710]
it because i think it would get the crowd just smoking and smolering and everybody would go nuts

[01:01:09.710 --> 01:01:13.850]
if they played at about seven twenty before they had the starting lineups come out it would be dynamite

[01:01:13.850 --> 01:01:17.450]
well that's what i have always said plus you have another song that's much more upbeat too

[01:01:17.450 --> 01:01:22.230]
yeah the hockey night tonight right yeah right yeah well that's all cbc stuff

[01:01:22.230 --> 01:01:27.870]
well because they really know how to do it right that's right well thank you very very much i won't

[01:01:27.870 --> 01:01:33.590]
forget i won't forget you thank you okay bye bye open line of brow art five two four nine four six three

[01:01:33.590 --> 01:01:37.630]
see this is the one uh is uh we're gonna hear from somebody that's gonna be glad if we go to fm

[01:01:38.830 --> 01:01:42.690]
because see a lot of people that can barely hear us on a hammer like people who work inside or even

[01:01:42.690 --> 01:01:46.230]
people in their homes are like right now when the weather is real crappy and it's raining and it's storming

[01:01:46.230 --> 01:01:52.610]
and like i said like that huh or maybe the people that are gonna be real happy can't hear us right now

[01:01:52.610 --> 01:01:56.110]
or don't even know that we exist right now which is like ninety percent of the audience in this

[01:01:56.110 --> 01:02:00.350]
guide day market because they don't turn on a m the living and breathing people trust me what i'd

[01:02:00.350 --> 01:02:05.070]
tell you they wouldn't know a m from their ass who was that just now by the way is that another rumor

[01:02:06.730 --> 01:02:12.710]
who was that what on the bat line or were you oh that was uh yeah i'll give you an update

[01:02:12.710 --> 01:02:21.090]
during the break well let's do it right now come on Miriam let's go i got to have my celebratory

[01:02:21.090 --> 01:02:25.630]
haircut for tomorrow i got to get the looking real young and pretty right here in real slim just

[01:02:25.630 --> 01:02:29.970]
like Brad Pitt only too bad i gave away that magazine you can't see bread pits penis she's soaking

[01:02:29.970 --> 01:02:36.350]
have you seen bread pits penis no well you're not missing much real skinny and his uh body too

[01:02:36.350 --> 01:02:41.230]
so anyway now he you know Brad Pitt i'm sorry you know his best days are behind him

[01:02:41.230 --> 01:02:46.470]
they're in his uh past like the other side of the tracks there was a movie he could really act

[01:02:46.470 --> 01:02:50.770]
great in because he was in it with Ricky Schroeder now compared to Ricky Schroeder he's a fantastic

[01:02:50.770 --> 01:02:56.510]
actor he's like a Marlon Brando but when he tries to be Marlon Brando in seven his acting is just

[01:02:56.510 --> 01:03:02.810]
absolutely on a scale of zero minus infinity it is so bad okay and these people that are calling

[01:03:02.810 --> 01:03:06.710]
to suck around with Rick Riley saying oh yeah i agree i liked it too and then when you like

[01:03:06.710 --> 01:03:11.690]
nailer as to the while they agree that the acting sucked how can you go see a movie any acting

[01:03:11.690 --> 01:03:16.250]
is pathetic and the script is horrible the dialogue is embarrassing and you still say it's great

[01:03:16.250 --> 01:03:20.850]
and i guess that's because you like a lot of blood and guts okay well if you like a lot of blood

[01:03:20.850 --> 01:03:25.790]
and guts you ought to come around this place tomorrow right more than you'll ever see in seven

[01:03:27.070 --> 01:03:33.350]

nobody will ever live long enough to see any arena down there

[01:06:13.610 --> 01:06:19.150]
and listen i was listening to the uh... the game on radio this night because i was driving up to

[01:06:19.150 --> 01:06:25.390]
our towards Orlando yeah and uh... what do you have my condolences at the end of the game old your

[01:06:25.390 --> 01:06:33.050]
buddy there beneath pod van there he was uh... describing how uh... mr. beratho uh... was uh...

[01:06:33.050 --> 01:06:39.910]
waving his arms in the air you know skate around the arena like he was you know the big hero yeah and then uh...

[01:06:39.910 --> 01:06:42.410]
mr. potman there said uh...

[01:06:42.410 --> 01:06:44.510]
making a reference to how the uh...

[01:06:44.510 --> 01:06:49.450]
panther's gonna have a tough time now because we're really dealing with a hot goalie and we could be in trouble

[01:06:50.170 --> 01:06:51.950]
and i'm one of the penguins dealing with

[01:06:51.950 --> 01:06:57.150]
like the bison's not a hot goal i know i know i know that beracel played great last night there's no question about

[01:06:57.150 --> 01:07:02.450]
a but like i've said before he's very inconsistent that's the problem with beracel and always has been to play one great game

[01:07:02.450 --> 01:07:05.070]
and he can turn around the next game instinct to join out

[01:07:05.070 --> 01:07:11.850]
now all the beneath there was just a praise and i mean now you know how come all of a sudden every every report i hear about

[01:07:11.850 --> 01:07:17.090]
the nieces that since the playoff started to become a turn coat and all he does now is uh... you know praise the other team

[01:07:17.090 --> 01:07:23.090]
about our guy i thought the bs are played sensational again i know that's what i thought he was the announcer for the other team

[01:07:23.090 --> 01:07:24.530]
the way he started talking about

[01:07:25.210 --> 01:07:29.510]
you know uh... beratho and he's got his arms in the air and now we're going to hot goalie

[01:07:29.510 --> 01:07:31.690]
what do you expect from a frog like that anyway you know

[01:07:32.210 --> 01:07:38.130]
and uh... these two home games we got to win them really put the pressure on them well i would be nice but i still say just like

[01:07:38.130 --> 01:07:42.590]
fill it out here if we split the next two and wind up to a piece and we go up there we sneak again you do

[01:07:42.590 --> 01:07:44.990]
understand if you've been watching the uh...

[01:07:44.990 --> 01:07:49.450]
the results of the games that pitburg has had a really tough time in the playoffs this year at home they've had a

[01:07:49.450 --> 01:07:50.650]
very crappy home record

[01:07:50.650 --> 01:07:52.890]
yeah and uh... you can beat him up there

[01:07:52.890 --> 01:07:58.830]
well i figured we put it up pressure on and when these two games in the mario old home back to having the

[01:07:58.830 --> 01:08:00.010]
bowel movement again you know

[01:08:00.670 --> 01:08:04.710]

i knew yes sir

[01:09:07.430 --> 01:09:14.170]
a couple things uh... first of all in a game i think uh... i thought the panthers were trying a little bit too hard last night

[01:09:14.170 --> 01:09:15.910]
that's why they were missing some of those uh...

[01:09:17.170 --> 01:09:19.050]
shots and when they were taking the puck down the ice

[01:09:19.050 --> 01:09:21.370]
yeah and another thing i was like

[01:09:21.370 --> 01:09:26.970]
well listen you know like somebody said before sometimes you get a lucky bounce or two like we did in the first game and other times uh... the

[01:09:26.970 --> 01:09:32.830]
puck bounces the wrong way like it did a couple of times last night it's you know it's uh... the way it goes you can't get all the breaks all the time

[01:09:32.830 --> 01:09:34.810]
yeah uh... another thing i was

[01:09:35.370 --> 01:09:38.090]
went to borders to try to get uh... uh... some of your tape

screw you over here, right? 1247 at WIOD.

[01:11:12.990 --> 01:11:15.270]
Use talk at entertainment radio.

[01:11:15.710 --> 01:11:18.350]
610 WIOD.

[01:11:18.810 --> 01:11:21.030]
I have no cavities. I have no teeth.

[01:11:22.530 --> 01:11:26.890]
Recently, sightings of an enormous object have been popping up everywhere.

[01:11:27.590 --> 01:11:31.930]
It's so big. So huge. It's non-natural.

[01:11:32.370 --> 01:11:35.470]
I've never seen anything so big. Something so big.

[01:11:36.110 --> 01:11:39.810]
So gargantuan, you won't believe your eyes.

[01:11:39.970 --> 01:11:42.250]
I thought I knew big, but this is big.

[01:11:42.570 --> 01:11:46.790]
It's John Holmes Pizza. The biggest pizza you've ever seen.

[01:11:47.350 --> 01:11:51.150]
A full 18 inches of delicious pizza.

[01:11:51.430 --> 01:11:53.610]
How could you possibly fit all that in your mouth?

[01:11:53.910 --> 01:11:54.730]
I can handle it.

[01:11:54.770 --> 01:11:58.510]
John Holmes Pizza. It's bigger than pizza pizza.

[01:11:59.110 --> 01:12:03.390]
It's pizza pizza pizza pizza pizza pizza pizza pizza pizza.

[01:12:03.390 --> 01:12:06.910]
I don't think I could handle all that, but I'd be willing to try.

[01:12:07.370 --> 01:12:12.190]
John Holmes Pizza. Coming soon on a table near you.

[01:12:13.430 --> 01:12:17.390]
1252 at WIOD. So anyway, the rumors are just flying all around the building.

[01:12:18.050 --> 01:12:19.690]
And we got our big stuff going on tomorrow.

[01:12:20.010 --> 01:12:23.110]
And what's the purpose? Why don't we just shut the whole damn thing off until tomorrow?

[01:12:23.270 --> 01:12:24.470]
We got to get to sponsor. Okay.

[01:12:24.810 --> 01:12:27.050]
Why don't we run them just all back to back and then get out of here?

[01:12:28.630 --> 01:12:32.670]
Here's another guy that's getting to be so chronic now that I'm ready to puke my brains out.

[01:12:32.670 --> 01:12:35.370]
I'm ready to start up-chucking orange puke all over the counter.

[01:12:35.490 --> 01:12:37.150]
So Rick's paranoid, huh?

[01:12:37.890 --> 01:12:38.090]
Who?

[01:12:38.470 --> 01:12:38.610]
Rick.

[01:12:39.130 --> 01:12:39.450]
Who's that?

[01:12:39.630 --> 01:12:39.850]
Riley.

[01:12:40.290 --> 01:12:40.630]
Who?

[01:12:41.010 --> 01:12:41.870]
And I wet my pants.

[01:12:41.990 --> 01:12:45.170]
Well, I got a call from somebody who knows somebody.

[01:12:45.470 --> 01:12:46.270]
Oh, here we go.

[01:12:46.790 --> 01:12:47.910]
Are you going to be a Yenton now?

[01:12:47.950 --> 01:12:48.330]
Is that it?

[01:12:49.010 --> 01:12:49.850]
It's not bad enough.

[01:12:49.990 --> 01:12:53.630]
You were that bogus diet of yours with that damn twilight zone diet.

[01:12:53.930 --> 01:12:54.530]
Stand majors.

[01:12:56.450 --> 01:12:58.770]
Yeah, stand majors is coming back right now.

[01:12:58.950 --> 01:12:59.690]
Yeah, so is Jesus.

[01:13:01.170 --> 01:13:02.890]
Did Lemieux really have the squirts?

[01:13:03.630 --> 01:13:03.810]
Yes.

[01:13:04.110 --> 01:13:04.930]
When- how did you find out?

[01:13:04.930 --> 01:13:06.470]
I don't know if it was the squirts.

[01:13:06.470 --> 01:13:07.970]
He had the- yes.

[01:13:08.550 --> 01:13:10.030]
He looked constipated the whole thing.

[01:13:10.350 --> 01:13:11.010]
No, he did not.

[01:13:11.170 --> 01:13:11.790]
He looked sick.

[01:13:12.290 --> 01:13:16.090]
He looked very pale and sickly like he had the stomach flu like everybody else did.

[01:13:16.390 --> 01:13:19.270]
Only his expressed itself in a more explosive way of it.

[01:13:19.290 --> 01:13:20.190]
Well, it's only going to get worse.

[01:13:20.690 --> 01:13:21.030]
Good.

[01:13:21.930 --> 01:13:23.630]
And you know something that won't make any difference.

[01:13:23.890 --> 01:13:24.790]
He's just too damn good.

[01:13:24.890 --> 01:13:25.470]
That's the problem.

[01:13:25.630 --> 01:13:26.910]
Listen, you've been right all along.

[01:13:27.070 --> 01:13:28.530]
Wayne is not going to stop the team.

[01:13:28.710 --> 01:13:28.930]
Yeah.

[01:13:29.470 --> 01:13:31.790]
I think his wife will kick the living crap out of him.

[01:13:32.330 --> 01:13:33.590]
His wife and maybe one of his sons.

[01:13:33.670 --> 01:13:34.910]
She's obsessed with it.

[01:13:34.990 --> 01:13:35.110]
Yeah.

[01:13:36.090 --> 01:13:36.910]
With his bars.

[01:13:37.110 --> 01:13:38.550]
But he's got the hots for Billy Lindsay.

[01:13:39.110 --> 01:13:39.470]
Who does?

[01:13:39.630 --> 01:13:39.890]
His wife?

[01:13:40.070 --> 01:13:40.450]
I don't know.

[01:13:40.630 --> 01:13:41.310]
I just made that up.

[01:13:41.650 --> 01:13:43.730]
Did you hear about the story about Lowry the other day?

[01:13:43.970 --> 01:13:44.150]
No.

[01:13:44.410 --> 01:13:46.510]
At the Boka place, the Boka bagel place?

[01:13:46.670 --> 01:13:47.190]
No, I did not.

[01:13:47.530 --> 01:13:48.670]
You know how shy he is.

[01:13:49.250 --> 01:13:49.810]
You know, in the interview,

[01:13:50.030 --> 01:13:51.790]
I really don't because I don't know him.

[01:13:51.850 --> 01:13:54.870]
I don't know any of the players other than I met the Beeser at Pompato Park one night

[01:13:54.870 --> 01:13:56.550]
the first year and other than that, I don't know.

[01:13:56.610 --> 01:13:57.030]
But you know what?

[01:13:57.110 --> 01:13:58.150]
You've seen him interviewed, right?

[01:13:58.150 --> 01:13:59.630]
Yeah, I wouldn't say he's shy,

[01:13:59.850 --> 01:14:01.410]
but he's not, you know, a real

[01:14:01.990 --> 01:14:03.170]
grigourious kind of guy, right?

[01:14:03.510 --> 01:14:06.070]
Well, anyway, he walked into the bagel joint with his wife

[01:14:06.070 --> 01:14:07.390]
the day after a game.

[01:14:08.370 --> 01:14:10.290]
Everybody stams up and starts clapping.

[01:14:10.450 --> 01:14:10.710]
Great.

[01:14:12.650 --> 01:14:13.270]
But anyway.

[01:14:13.490 --> 01:14:13.950]
Were you there?

[01:14:14.350 --> 01:14:15.870]
No, I walked in right after it happened.

[01:14:16.210 --> 01:14:17.310]
Oh, so I just missed it.

[01:14:18.310 --> 01:14:19.130]
But anyway, listen now.

[01:14:19.190 --> 01:14:20.170]
What were you doing in a bagel joint?

[01:14:20.330 --> 01:14:20.970]
What were you eating there?

[01:14:21.790 --> 01:14:23.250]
I was getting some rashes from my wife.

[01:14:23.390 --> 01:14:23.510]
No.

[01:14:25.030 --> 01:14:26.490]
I'm still on the diet, by the way.

[01:14:26.710 --> 01:14:27.930]
On the twilight zone diet?

[01:14:27.930 --> 01:14:28.430]
On the sound.

[01:14:28.610 --> 01:14:28.790]
Great.

[01:14:28.950 --> 01:14:29.710]
I'm happy for you.

[01:14:29.710 --> 01:14:31.270]
Let's just as far as Brad Pitt goes.

[01:14:31.330 --> 01:14:31.590]
Yeah.

[01:14:31.890 --> 01:14:32.970]
He wasn't his fault.

[01:14:33.070 --> 01:14:34.590]
The director screwed that movie up.

[01:14:34.730 --> 01:14:36.790]
Because everybody in that movie acted like crap.

[01:14:37.450 --> 01:14:38.990]
Did you see him in seven monkeys?

[01:14:39.970 --> 01:14:40.890]
No, I did not.

[01:14:41.010 --> 01:14:41.470]
I'm not talking about.

[01:14:41.750 --> 01:14:42.610]
No, I did not.

[01:14:44.570 --> 01:14:46.110]
What NBA team was that about?

[01:14:47.630 --> 01:14:48.190]
He's too short.

[01:14:48.690 --> 01:14:50.650]
He's much too short to be an NBA player.

[01:14:51.130 --> 01:14:53.050]
Anyway, see seven monkeys.

[01:14:53.630 --> 01:14:55.330]
Well, no, I'm not going to see seven monkeys.

[01:14:55.330 --> 01:14:56.030]
What is it about?

[01:14:56.030 --> 01:14:58.190]
I'm happy because it's a murder kind of thing.

[01:14:58.350 --> 01:15:01.670]
It's a serial murder thing with the Kyle Sosa guy.

[01:15:01.830 --> 01:15:02.510]
I don't know his name.

[01:15:02.770 --> 01:15:03.350]
Sandy Sosa?

[01:15:03.730 --> 01:15:04.330]
Kyle Sosa.

[01:15:04.470 --> 01:15:04.710]
Yeah.

[01:15:05.030 --> 01:15:06.130]
What the hell is that actor's name?

[01:15:06.270 --> 01:15:07.370]
I haven't got any idea.

[01:15:07.570 --> 01:15:09.930]
Anyway, go rent that movie.

[01:15:10.050 --> 01:15:10.310]
Okay.

[01:15:10.590 --> 01:15:11.610]
Somebody will call you about it.

[01:15:11.610 --> 01:15:12.870]
Well, he really stuck in this movie.

[01:15:12.990 --> 01:15:13.270]
I'll tell you.

[01:15:13.310 --> 01:15:13.870]
I agree.

[01:15:14.030 --> 01:15:14.470]
But he wasn't going to.

[01:15:14.470 --> 01:15:17.830]
And his and his effort to be Marlon Brando Jr.

[01:15:18.190 --> 01:15:19.110]
I mean, it's so obvious.

[01:15:19.370 --> 01:15:23.010]
Every every every mannerism, every facial expression,

[01:15:23.010 --> 01:15:24.430]
every fart that he did,

[01:15:24.430 --> 01:15:26.210]
it smelled just like Marlon's man.

[01:15:26.270 --> 01:15:27.070]
It was just pathetic.

[01:15:27.510 --> 01:15:30.930]
By the way, you may want to put out a call for Johnny Depp.

[01:15:31.450 --> 01:15:32.310]
What was that?

[01:15:32.570 --> 01:15:33.510]
He's back in town.

[01:15:33.750 --> 01:15:37.750]
Oh, he's forgotten about all of us.

[01:15:37.910 --> 01:15:40.150]
And for all those from way back in the past,

[01:15:40.410 --> 01:15:41.990]
from the Agora and the button south,

[01:15:42.210 --> 01:15:43.530]
he's putting the band back together.

[01:15:44.010 --> 01:15:44.630]
Well, that's great.

[01:15:45.150 --> 01:15:45.810]
So he's around.

[01:15:46.170 --> 01:15:47.690]
Is River penis going to be in it?

[01:15:48.090 --> 01:15:49.470]
Yeah, hopefully.

[01:15:49.870 --> 01:15:50.570]
Yeah, unlikely.

[01:15:50.970 --> 01:15:52.670]
Anyway, as far as fractures,

[01:15:52.670 --> 01:15:55.230]
I don't give a crap what his penis looks like.

[01:15:55.650 --> 01:15:56.490]
Or who cares?

[01:15:57.030 --> 01:15:57.730]
A lot of people.

[01:15:58.170 --> 01:15:59.630]
All women don't give a crap about that.

[01:15:59.810 --> 01:16:01.050]
No, you're wrong about that.

[01:16:01.570 --> 01:16:02.750]
Trust me when I tell you.

[01:16:03.310 --> 01:16:04.330]
Fags care about it.

[01:16:04.630 --> 01:16:07.090]
Well, no, I would tend to agree that a flaccid penis

[01:16:07.090 --> 01:16:09.410]
is not a particularly, uh, you know what I'm saying?

[01:16:09.770 --> 01:16:11.610]
It's not something to hear really all that excited about.

[01:16:11.710 --> 01:16:13.670]
Unless you haven't seen one in a long time.

[01:16:14.330 --> 01:16:15.330]
Neither is Clotoris.

[01:16:15.410 --> 01:16:16.510]
Kind of like Al Goldstein.

[01:16:16.890 --> 01:16:18.190]
On that note, have a good day.

[01:16:23.590 --> 01:16:26.250]
Flavor, quality, and more.

[01:16:26.810 --> 01:16:28.610]
Plus, it's cholesterol-free.

[01:16:29.230 --> 01:16:33.310]
It's the new package meat that everyone in your family can agree on.

[01:16:33.390 --> 01:16:35.070]
I love my mister monkey.

[01:16:36.030 --> 01:16:37.450]
Where were our flavor?

[01:16:38.110 --> 01:16:39.010]
There's a fact.

[01:16:39.770 --> 01:16:40.730]
Yummy monkeys.

[01:16:41.350 --> 01:16:42.270]
How about that?

[01:16:42.930 --> 01:16:46.610]
Mr. Monkey package meats have a variety to satisfy every appetite.

[01:16:47.290 --> 01:16:47.870]
Monkey sausage.

[01:16:48.450 --> 01:16:49.450]
Monkey lunch in meat.

[01:16:49.910 --> 01:16:50.690]
Monkey dives.

[01:16:51.010 --> 01:16:51.950]
Monkey pastrami.

[01:16:51.950 --> 01:16:54.710]
Ad Mr. Monkey to sell your favorite dishes like

[01:16:54.710 --> 01:16:56.090]
macaroni and cheese.

[01:16:56.750 --> 01:16:58.110]
Spaghetti and monkey balls.

[01:16:58.690 --> 01:16:59.470]
Monkey pot five.

[01:16:59.930 --> 01:17:02.390]
And our favorite funky monkey casserole.

[01:17:02.650 --> 01:17:04.270]
Poor delicious meal anytime.

[01:17:04.690 --> 01:17:05.390]
Thing Mr. Monkey.

[01:17:05.710 --> 01:17:08.830]
No gorillas, no eggs, no chefs, and no MSG.

[01:17:09.110 --> 01:17:09.670]
Taste good.

[01:17:10.170 --> 01:17:10.790]
We know it.

[01:17:11.010 --> 01:17:11.210]
One.

[01:17:12.990 --> 01:17:14.670]
I love my mister monkey.

[01:17:15.490 --> 01:17:18.310]
And now I'm just saying that movie with Brad Pitt was Mr. Monkey meat

[01:17:18.310 --> 01:17:19.090]
something like that.

[01:17:19.090 --> 01:17:21.410]
Funky monkey, it sounds like a Ben and Jerry's flavor.

[01:17:22.090 --> 01:17:23.470]
Okay, let's do a Miami.

[01:17:23.470 --> 01:17:23.870]
Hello.

[01:17:23.970 --> 01:17:25.150]
Hey, how's it going?

[01:17:25.270 --> 01:17:25.710]
The okay.

[01:17:26.190 --> 01:17:28.850]
Had one thing about, you know, if y'all get sold,

[01:17:28.970 --> 01:17:32.370]
I hope the first thing they do is get rid of sky by traffic.

[01:17:32.630 --> 01:17:33.070]
Really?

[01:17:33.530 --> 01:17:33.970]
Jesus.

[01:17:34.170 --> 01:17:37.170]
Have you heard the guy in the afternoon with the on the thumbnail?

[01:17:37.590 --> 01:17:37.990]
Frightening.

[01:17:38.190 --> 01:17:40.490]
He calls himself the traffic vulture.

[01:17:40.970 --> 01:17:42.950]
He's going to swoop down there and uh...

[01:17:42.950 --> 01:17:43.670]
He's the sport now.

[01:17:43.690 --> 01:17:46.030]
Wait a minute, the traffic vulture that's the sports guy, right George?

[01:17:46.230 --> 01:17:48.210]
The traffic intern with the glasses?

[01:17:49.210 --> 01:17:50.270]
You know, I don't know his name.

[01:17:50.390 --> 01:17:51.790]
Oh, we don't know his name.

[01:17:51.950 --> 01:17:52.670]
It's sick me.

[01:17:52.990 --> 01:17:53.970]
Get rid of mall.

[01:17:54.490 --> 01:17:55.810]
And then there's always Stephen J. Gay.

[01:17:56.110 --> 01:17:57.390]
Oh yeah, that's a good one.

[01:17:57.490 --> 01:17:58.090]
He's another winner.

[01:17:58.630 --> 01:18:01.230]
He's he's he's worse on the traffic than he is on Saturday morning.

[01:18:01.250 --> 01:18:03.550]
I'm telling you if we could just run up a bunch of these kids that we got on air

[01:18:03.550 --> 01:18:06.770]
and set him over to QAM, they'd fit in like a glove, they can replace Rocky Bend over.

[01:18:07.030 --> 01:18:10.670]
As far as Stephen J. Gray, bring that Chris Baker, I know you hate him, the God.

[01:18:11.770 --> 01:18:12.690]
I don't think so.

[01:18:12.950 --> 01:18:14.570]
He's not coming back anytime soon.

[01:18:15.190 --> 01:18:15.510]
Okay.

[01:18:15.510 --> 01:18:19.250]
All the way does have about the 20 or 30 calls in the Steve Nichol, but don't hold your breath.

[01:18:19.310 --> 01:18:19.950]
Have a great day.

[01:18:20.590 --> 01:18:20.670]
Okay.

[01:18:21.290 --> 01:18:22.230]
Uh, open line in dates.

[01:18:22.570 --> 01:18:25.190]
7519-463-751, we got one in Broward.

[01:18:26.050 --> 01:18:26.770]
5249-463.

[01:18:27.590 --> 01:18:28.230]
Here's Miami.

[01:18:28.250 --> 01:18:28.610]
Hello.

[01:18:29.170 --> 01:18:29.490]
Heal.

[01:18:29.630 --> 01:18:30.010]
Yes, sir.

[01:18:30.710 --> 01:18:31.610]
All right, let me get...

[01:18:31.610 --> 01:18:31.910]
Neal.

[01:18:32.130 --> 01:18:32.450]
Yes, sir.

[01:18:32.750 --> 01:18:35.010]
All right, I have a pretty funny story I want to tell you about.

[01:18:35.490 --> 01:18:38.190]
I got a buddy of mine who, uh, a couple weeks ago,

[01:18:39.170 --> 01:18:44.150]
he got pretty soft, that some party, and uh, he ended up going to some...

[01:18:45.130 --> 01:18:47.390]
So anyway, we have an open line in a day.

[01:18:48.650 --> 01:18:51.210]
7519-463-751, that was really brilliant, pal.

[01:18:51.210 --> 01:18:51.990]
It was outstanding.

[01:18:51.990 --> 01:18:54.670]
And of course, uh, I hope he had a good experience doing it.

[01:18:55.090 --> 01:18:58.750]
Open line in the green line, 189-449-463.

[01:18:59.850 --> 01:19:02.210]
Whatever, what kind of a cigar was this, do you gave me today?

[01:19:02.330 --> 01:19:04.890]
Is this like the last genuine Havanian monkey?

[01:19:04.950 --> 01:19:06.530]
Is this a Jack Cavorkean cigar?

[01:19:07.310 --> 01:19:09.170]
Which I wish I would have seen that with Andy Rooney, though.

[01:19:09.270 --> 01:19:12.050]
I saw it a little bit of it on 60 minutes when they were promoting it.

[01:19:12.310 --> 01:19:12.830]
That's very good.

[01:19:12.830 --> 01:19:15.050]
But, uh, Dr. Jack told it like it is.

[01:19:15.150 --> 01:19:18.070]
He says, all these people with their hoax-pocus religion, he was not gonna add.

[01:19:18.350 --> 01:19:19.210]
What did Andy Rooney do?

[01:19:19.310 --> 01:19:20.170]
Did he like raise his eyebrows?

[01:19:20.770 --> 01:19:21.570]
He went, uh-huh.

[01:19:21.910 --> 01:19:22.090]
Uh-huh.

[01:19:22.150 --> 01:19:22.450]
Exactly.

[01:19:22.990 --> 01:19:24.510]
You don't feel strong about this, do you?

[01:19:26.090 --> 01:19:28.750]
And by the way, the first one, speaking of Andy Rooney,

[01:19:29.110 --> 01:19:31.130]
maybe Dr. Jack ought to work on him next time.

[01:19:31.970 --> 01:19:33.490]
Say it like this.

[01:19:34.890 --> 01:19:38.870]
610-W-I-O-D-L-Fort Lauderdale.

[01:19:39.170 --> 01:19:40.950]
News taught and entertained the radio.

[01:19:40.950 --> 01:19:43.710]
610-W-I-O-D.

[01:19:44.190 --> 01:19:46.710]
Just the one to two-hour, it's a phenomenon.

[01:19:49.910 --> 01:19:56.590]
There's a dream that risks keeping every heart.

[01:19:57.210 --> 01:19:59.890]
Your's gone and made.

[01:20:00.970 --> 01:20:03.510]
Let's just leave them mark.

[01:20:04.610 --> 01:20:06.910]
And it's worth the rest.

[01:20:29.030 --> 01:20:31.130]
And it's worth the rest,

[01:20:31.130 --> 01:20:31.130]

[01:20:31.130 --> 01:20:31.130]

[01:20:31.130 --> 01:20:31.130]

[01:20:31.130 --> 01:20:33.410]
And it's worth the rest.

[01:20:34.710 --> 01:20:36.890]
And it's worth the rest.

[01:21:20.130 --> 01:21:23.730]
So Sarah, that light out there that says on the air the one that's all lit up there when

[01:21:23.730 --> 01:21:24.550]
the microphone is open.

[01:21:24.650 --> 01:21:26.590]
I mean, somebody's got the mic open and here you're ready to speak.

[01:21:26.730 --> 01:21:27.510]
But hey, how you doing, Sarah?

[01:21:28.290 --> 01:21:33.330]
So anyway, 107 at WIOD and you'll be very distraught to know that the Panthers were very enthusiastic

[01:21:33.330 --> 01:21:37.210]
and excited about playing that at the game or all the rest of the playoff games.

[01:21:37.770 --> 01:21:41.230]
John Shannon up at the CBC told Rimmer, it's not a good idea.

[01:21:42.390 --> 01:21:45.990]
This is the same John Shannon who refuses to cut loose with those bill.

[01:21:46.070 --> 01:21:49.410]
He would tape that he'd been promising me for the last year and a half now and will never

[01:21:49.410 --> 01:21:52.350]
come through with because he's a butt plug basically.

[01:21:53.030 --> 01:21:54.090]
So screw him, okay.

[01:21:54.170 --> 01:21:58.210]
We'll stick with Cherry and Ron McClain and all the good guys on CBC and John McClain,

[01:21:58.210 --> 01:22:00.470]
whatever your name is Shannon, up yours.

[01:22:00.770 --> 01:22:02.050]
Probably kind of Tommy Shannon.

[01:22:03.490 --> 01:22:04.550]
Here's Boka, hello.

[01:22:04.910 --> 01:22:05.710]
Yeah, sir.

[01:22:05.870 --> 01:22:06.970]
Hey, what's up, man?

[01:22:07.170 --> 01:22:07.590]
I don't know.

[01:22:07.910 --> 01:22:09.210]
Panther only hockey network.

[01:22:10.030 --> 01:22:13.230]
Hey, I'm so surprised no one's called you yet on this.

[01:22:13.670 --> 01:22:14.750]
I know you're watching the game.

[01:22:15.090 --> 01:22:15.310]
Yeah.

[01:22:16.470 --> 01:22:18.050]
When Lemugra dragged on.

[01:22:19.390 --> 01:22:20.230]
When he got what?

[01:22:20.430 --> 01:22:24.190]
He was on a breakaway in the third period and he gets dragged down.

[01:22:24.190 --> 01:22:24.970]
That's fairly, yeah.

[01:22:24.970 --> 01:22:29.570]
And when he's falling, he's falling with one hand on his face.

[01:22:29.590 --> 01:22:31.090]
And he still made a great shot in the BZR.

[01:22:31.150 --> 01:22:32.530]
He had to make his sensational save, yeah.

[01:22:32.750 --> 01:22:33.290]
He was incredible.

[01:22:33.750 --> 01:22:33.910]
Yeah.

[01:22:34.230 --> 01:22:36.010]
But I don't know.

[01:22:37.310 --> 01:22:39.730]
I'm tormenting too on the stand saver thing.

[01:22:40.090 --> 01:22:40.270]
Yeah.

[01:22:40.630 --> 01:22:43.790]
You got to understand those guys are homers and you know.

[01:22:43.790 --> 01:22:44.310]
No, wait a minute.

[01:22:44.410 --> 01:22:49.850]
There's nothing wrong with being a homer, but he was so unfair and you know, and I've

[01:22:49.850 --> 01:22:53.250]
watched him for a long time or at least for a couple years since I had a small dish.

[01:22:53.250 --> 01:22:57.690]
But to come up with these comments about how we're going to fall hard and fast is if

[01:22:57.690 --> 01:23:01.190]
to say we really stink the joint out and we're peeing in our pants and we're scared to

[01:23:01.190 --> 01:23:01.650]
death of them.

[01:23:01.690 --> 01:23:03.210]
I don't believe that for a second.

[01:23:03.490 --> 01:23:03.530]
Yeah.

[01:23:03.530 --> 01:23:07.610]
The first two minutes of the game last night, it was very obvious to me that they came

[01:23:07.610 --> 01:23:11.490]
out with the idea of scoring real quick and getting the jump on us and they just were

[01:23:11.490 --> 01:23:14.030]
like had us bottled up the first two minutes and it was scary.

[01:23:14.230 --> 01:23:17.910]
But after that, the rest of the first period, we outplayed him and outchanced him by it.

[01:23:17.990 --> 01:23:20.030]
We had all the good chances in the first period.

[01:23:20.030 --> 01:23:20.330]
Yeah.

[01:23:20.550 --> 01:23:24.330]
I mean, if they would have capitalized on it might have been a different outcome.

[01:23:24.410 --> 01:23:24.550]
Right.

[01:23:25.210 --> 01:23:31.150]
But how many games do you have to win in a playoff space before somebody starts giving you

[01:23:31.150 --> 01:23:32.050]
some credit for it?

[01:23:32.110 --> 01:23:32.630]
Yeah, you're right.

[01:23:33.170 --> 01:23:35.350]
I mean, it's like the whole nation's against the Panthers also.

[01:23:35.510 --> 01:23:35.690]
Yeah.

[01:23:35.790 --> 01:23:37.070]
Well, I don't think that that's true though.

[01:23:37.110 --> 01:23:41.050]
I think some of the broadcasts are, but I think there are a lot of people like the other

[01:23:41.050 --> 01:23:41.350]
dog.

[01:23:41.570 --> 01:23:41.770]
Right.

[01:23:42.030 --> 01:23:43.370]
A lot of underdog people out there.

[01:23:43.790 --> 01:23:49.330]
But what, you know, listen to you all day, since the Panthers are on this rule and

[01:23:49.330 --> 01:23:54.110]
what not, you know, the colors call in and they're, you know, a lot of them are uneducated

[01:23:54.110 --> 01:23:59.130]
in what they say about like the panthers and what not and the flyers and, you know, well,

[01:23:59.190 --> 01:24:00.250]
I'll give you an example.

[01:24:00.390 --> 01:24:02.930]
Everybody talking about what a dirty player Eric Lindross is.

[01:24:03.070 --> 01:24:03.870]
I don't agree with that.

[01:24:04.070 --> 01:24:06.390]
Lindross is capable of, you know, doing a lot of stick work.

[01:24:06.810 --> 01:24:08.050]
Lindross is a great player.

[01:24:08.530 --> 01:24:11.810]
And you know, the guys in this town now who are jumping on the bandwagon about what an

[01:24:11.810 --> 01:24:13.610]
asshole he is, I don't agree with that at all.

[01:24:13.730 --> 01:24:16.450]
We would take him on our team in a heartbeat in a half a second.

[01:24:16.450 --> 01:24:18.910]
He's one of the, you know, top 10 players in a league.

[01:24:19.450 --> 01:24:20.710]
But you're right.

[01:24:20.890 --> 01:24:23.530]
There are a lot of assholes, especially in the media who know nothing about it.

[01:24:23.770 --> 01:24:26.770]
Now they're jumping on the bandwagon so they're opening up a big mouth and they don't

[01:24:26.770 --> 01:24:27.650]
know what they're talking about.

[01:24:28.250 --> 01:24:29.390]
Everyone's hockey intelligent.

[01:24:29.550 --> 01:24:32.630]
I don't know how anybody can knock the penguins other than the fact that they're defenses

[01:24:32.630 --> 01:24:35.870]
suspect, but other than that, how can you knock this team?

[01:24:36.430 --> 01:24:36.590]
Yeah.

[01:24:36.930 --> 01:24:38.130]
That's right.

[01:24:38.290 --> 01:24:39.970]
I mean, I'm obviously a penguin fan.

[01:24:40.510 --> 01:24:44.390]
So, I mean, I'm listening and I'm trying to get frustrated by the, you know, the lack of,

[01:24:44.390 --> 01:24:47.510]
you know, a lot of people don't watch them all year and they really don't know any of that.

[01:24:47.530 --> 01:24:51.630]
Well, you know, when you see Mario come out of the, out of the toilet there and he comes

[01:24:51.630 --> 01:24:54.650]
on the ice and they got the power play and he makes that pass to Yager.

[01:24:54.830 --> 01:24:56.810]
There is nobody else who makes that pass.

[01:24:56.950 --> 01:24:58.050]
I don't care how sick he was.

[01:24:58.310 --> 01:25:02.190]
He still makes that incredible pass right across to the other side of the net and there's

[01:25:02.190 --> 01:25:06.230]
Yager on the doorstep and that's the key to their success in a power play is the incredible

[01:25:06.230 --> 01:25:07.070]
passing they do.

[01:25:07.310 --> 01:25:11.250]
They pass the puck around like, you know, only other teams can only dream of doing that.

[01:25:11.250 --> 01:25:15.170]
And then Mario, when you expect it to least, you know, he sick as a dog and he makes the

[01:25:15.170 --> 01:25:18.370]
perfect pass right on the tape and it's in the net and then of course he gets the winning

[01:25:18.370 --> 01:25:18.590]
gold.

[01:25:18.610 --> 01:25:19.470]
I had insult to injury.

[01:25:19.670 --> 01:25:19.990]
Right.

[01:25:20.350 --> 01:25:20.710]
There's nobody.

[01:25:20.870 --> 01:25:22.490]
I don't care what anybody tells you.

[01:25:22.590 --> 01:25:25.190]
There is nobody even close to Mario Lemue and at league.

[01:25:25.410 --> 01:25:25.790]
No, no.

[01:25:26.270 --> 01:25:29.290]
One of the most exciting players that's ever come down the pike.

[01:25:29.450 --> 01:25:29.630]
Yep.

[01:25:29.950 --> 01:25:34.710]
So, well, Neil, I'll see you Friday at the mouthhouse.

[01:25:34.910 --> 01:25:35.210]
Okay.

[01:25:35.430 --> 01:25:35.830]
Ready to bite.

[01:25:35.890 --> 01:25:36.170]
See ya.

[01:25:37.150 --> 01:25:39.950]
Yeah, I mean, it's one thing, you know, to be partisan and of course I'm rooting like

[01:25:39.950 --> 01:25:42.690]
crazy on every, every play every second for the Panthers.

[01:25:42.690 --> 01:25:46.490]
I mean, I'm on the edge of my seat, but Jesus at least be a little bit objective.

[01:25:46.490 --> 01:25:50.270]
I know that's something that most fans in most towns never heard of, but at least try

[01:25:50.270 --> 01:25:50.530]
it.

[01:25:51.010 --> 01:25:53.250]
You might have a better understanding of what the hell is going on.

[01:25:54.030 --> 01:25:56.490]
We have an open line in date, 751.

[01:25:56.550 --> 01:25:58.310]
We got one in Broward, five to four.

[01:25:58.390 --> 01:26:01.950]
We got two on the green lines and I'm sick and tired of all the faxes and all the phone

[01:26:01.950 --> 01:26:03.190]
calls about ESPN.

[01:26:03.350 --> 01:26:03.570]
Okay.

[01:26:03.910 --> 01:26:06.890]
They suck very Melrose sucks ESPN.

[01:26:06.890 --> 01:26:07.630]
They're covered sucks.

[01:26:07.750 --> 01:26:09.150]
I don't want to hear about it anymore.

[01:26:09.150 --> 01:26:09.530]
Okay.

[01:26:09.710 --> 01:26:11.790]
It sucked before it's going to continue to suck.

[01:26:12.270 --> 01:26:13.370]
Go to a sports bar.

[01:26:13.510 --> 01:26:14.970]
That's why we spent all day yesterday.

[01:26:15.330 --> 01:26:18.410]
Go to a good sports bar where they got a satellite dish and they got enough brains to put

[01:26:18.410 --> 01:26:22.870]
on the CBC where you see a good telecast to see Don Cherry there with the coach's corner

[01:26:22.870 --> 01:26:24.190]
get a few laughs in her too.

[01:26:25.230 --> 01:26:29.350]
And you know, and enjoy the game instead of sitting around there being a president of

[01:26:29.350 --> 01:26:30.370]
a god damn ESPN.

[01:26:31.830 --> 01:26:33.450]
Here's Carl Springs on the purple line.

[01:26:33.490 --> 01:26:33.730]
Hello.

[01:26:33.730 --> 01:26:40.350]
Hockey loving cigar smoke in Pompano, Betton, Phil Hendry, Listen and Redneck Hayton with

[01:26:40.350 --> 01:26:42.610]
the you prefer gay boy or you boy.

[01:26:43.850 --> 01:26:48.890]
We have an open line on the purple line, pound IOD, mobile one cell 18 T wireless and we

[01:26:48.890 --> 01:26:49.710]
got one on the green line.

[01:26:49.730 --> 01:26:51.170]
There's another real redneck for it.

[01:26:51.870 --> 01:26:52.330]
Okay.

[01:26:52.450 --> 01:26:55.350]
Pick a good one pal and chew it slow and get all the flavor.

[01:26:56.190 --> 01:26:57.930]
12 after one at WIOD.

[01:26:58.130 --> 01:26:58.770]
Big meal.

[01:26:59.050 --> 01:27:00.010]
It's big enough both of us.

[01:27:00.330 --> 01:27:02.010]
You watch her every day.

[01:27:02.010 --> 01:27:04.470]
She's an American icon.

[01:27:05.030 --> 01:27:10.190]
And now Kathy Lee Gifford rocks your world.

[01:27:10.890 --> 01:27:11.750]
Here I am.

[01:27:13.730 --> 01:27:15.290]
Rocky like a hurricane.

[01:27:16.050 --> 01:27:17.450]
Kathy Lee.

[01:27:17.750 --> 01:27:19.450]
Here I am.

[01:27:19.650 --> 01:27:20.770]
Kathy Lee Gifford.

[01:27:21.050 --> 01:27:22.110]
You'll get on this one.

[01:27:22.330 --> 01:27:23.610]
Where will I sell?

[01:27:24.370 --> 01:27:27.870]
That's the stage of here we are now.

[01:27:28.450 --> 01:27:29.770]
And a sailor.

[01:27:29.770 --> 01:27:32.950]
You'll get Kathy Lee singing hits from their butter.

[01:27:33.230 --> 01:27:38.170]
Scorpious, Metaclava, ACDC, songs like stairway to heaven.

[01:27:38.390 --> 01:27:39.390]
Slow ride.

[01:27:39.790 --> 01:27:42.510]
Feel like making love and this world.

[01:27:43.270 --> 01:27:43.630]
Yeah.

[01:27:44.230 --> 01:27:44.530]
Yeah.

[01:27:45.030 --> 01:27:46.570]
Do look like a lady.

[01:27:47.450 --> 01:27:47.450]

[01:27:48.050 --> 01:27:48.270]
Yeah.

[01:27:48.790 --> 01:27:50.290]
Do look like a lady.

[01:27:50.710 --> 01:27:51.850]
Kathy Lee rocks.

[01:27:52.510 --> 01:27:54.810]
But your collection water till she's gone.

[01:27:55.510 --> 01:27:56.870]
Kathy Lee rocks.

[01:27:56.870 --> 01:28:00.270]
We're available only at Radio Share.

[01:28:02.170 --> 01:28:02.570]
Gladysiah.

[01:28:05.670 --> 01:28:07.750]
She's something I'll say it on here what she is.

[01:28:07.990 --> 01:28:09.210]
116 at WIOD.

[01:28:09.330 --> 01:28:10.370]
We got an open line in Broward.

[01:28:11.590 --> 01:28:11.990]
5249463.

[01:28:13.090 --> 01:28:13.490]

In case you missed it, tomorrow is the big day.

[01:28:15.950 --> 01:28:16.470]
What does that mean?

[01:28:16.650 --> 01:28:17.570]
We haven't got any idea.

[01:28:17.730 --> 01:28:19.050]
But tomorrow is the big day.

[01:28:19.490 --> 01:28:23.410]
Major earth shaking developments in the radio industry including this radio station and

[01:28:23.410 --> 01:28:26.050]
others in this market tomorrow and stay tuned.

[01:28:26.890 --> 01:28:27.650]
What does that mean?

[01:28:27.870 --> 01:28:28.150]
I don't know.

[01:28:28.250 --> 01:28:29.190]
Here's a mobile and sunrise.

[01:28:29.390 --> 01:28:29.530]
Hello.

[01:28:29.950 --> 01:28:30.150]
Neil.

[01:28:30.350 --> 01:28:30.690]
Yes, sir.

[01:28:30.810 --> 01:28:31.790]
What a great game last night.

[01:28:32.190 --> 01:28:33.550]
Even though we lost, it was still a good game.

[01:28:33.790 --> 01:28:34.270]
That was OK.

[01:28:34.470 --> 01:28:38.250]
I was just happy to see that they were down in the beginning and they didn't fold and

[01:28:38.250 --> 01:28:39.510]
they kept fighting and kept coming back.

[01:28:39.830 --> 01:28:40.870]
We made it interesting.

[01:28:41.030 --> 01:28:41.170]
Yeah.

[01:28:41.290 --> 01:28:42.470]
They made it interesting.

[01:28:42.750 --> 01:28:47.170]
They made a competitive and it's just, you know, in the last 10 minutes of the first

[01:28:47.170 --> 01:28:50.930]
period and the first 10 minutes of the second period when Lumulia was out, that was

[01:28:50.930 --> 01:28:53.810]
their opportunity with all the, you know, misscoring chances and.

[01:28:53.930 --> 01:28:57.950]
Well, I think I think the entire first period after the first two minutes, I mean, we just

[01:28:57.950 --> 01:29:02.430]
took a two on the whole first period after we just came out like, you know, house on fire

[01:29:02.430 --> 01:29:03.910]
and then they kind of fizzled out.

[01:29:04.010 --> 01:29:07.750]
Yeah, you can't, you got to jump on top of those guys when you, when you can't, when

[01:29:07.750 --> 01:29:09.190]
you have the opportunity, they're going to score.

[01:29:09.190 --> 01:29:09.990]
Well, there's no such as those guys.

[01:29:09.990 --> 01:29:12.290]
It's with any team, every game you'll ever see.

[01:29:12.350 --> 01:29:16.070]
If you see a team that has lots of good chances early and they don't capitalize, they usually

[01:29:16.070 --> 01:29:16.630]
lose the game.

[01:29:16.750 --> 01:29:19.530]
Yeah, but more so with them, they just, they have so much scoring power.

[01:29:19.530 --> 01:29:21.730]
They, you're never too far away from them.

[01:29:21.730 --> 01:29:23.010]
They can always come back and get you.

[01:29:23.850 --> 01:29:28.110]
And it's just, I was just like I said, I was happy to see them keep it competitive and

[01:29:28.110 --> 01:29:29.770]
I just can't wait for these next two games at home.

[01:29:29.770 --> 01:29:32.870]
I think we play real well at home and hopefully we'll continue that.

[01:29:33.470 --> 01:29:34.730]
And I'm just excited about Friday.

[01:29:34.750 --> 01:29:35.270]
I can't wait.

[01:29:35.450 --> 01:29:36.510]
I think it's going to be great.

[01:29:37.070 --> 01:29:41.750]
And, you know, you were, I just, a lot of these fans out here, they just, they just can't

[01:29:41.750 --> 01:29:45.870]
get into it, you know, one loss and they get all depressed about it and it's seven games.

[01:29:46.070 --> 01:29:48.630]
Oh, yeah, I could tell the difference today when I came in today from yesterday.

[01:29:48.630 --> 01:29:51.910]
I mean, yesterday we would have thought we just wanted a guy named Stanley Cup and I

[01:29:51.910 --> 01:29:55.150]
come in this morning and, you know, start out here and it's like a little smattering

[01:29:55.150 --> 01:29:57.230]
of, they're all, they're all very meek today.

[01:29:57.470 --> 01:30:01.290]
Yeah, I mean, well, you have to win every game to keep your assignment level going or

[01:30:01.290 --> 01:30:01.490]
one.

[01:30:01.490 --> 01:30:02.550]
There are plenty of games left.

[01:30:02.690 --> 01:30:05.990]
But you got to understand when you deal with a lot of people who aren't real fans who

[01:30:05.990 --> 01:30:10.030]
are just the badwagon juppers, you know, they're, they're very easily deterred.

[01:30:10.170 --> 01:30:15.010]
And even, and even, even so, if they, let's just say God forbid they got swept in the next

[01:30:15.010 --> 01:30:17.490]
couple of games and they lost a series, they still have that.

[01:30:17.490 --> 01:30:19.010]
We have nothing left to prove.

[01:30:19.270 --> 01:30:20.470]
We had outstanding season.

[01:30:20.670 --> 01:30:23.370]
We had to the final four, man, we got to the semi finals.

[01:30:23.630 --> 01:30:25.870]
We got, you know, we had 92 points during the regular year.

[01:30:25.930 --> 01:30:26.650]
We had a great year.

[01:30:26.890 --> 01:30:30.170]
We finished ahead of almost everybody and, you know, we're still in there.

[01:30:30.370 --> 01:30:30.570]
Exactly.

[01:30:30.630 --> 01:30:31.450]
Rangers aren't playing.

[01:30:31.610 --> 01:30:33.570]
The flyers aren't playing.

[01:30:33.730 --> 01:30:35.590]
A lot of pretty damn good teams aren't playing anymore.

[01:30:35.710 --> 01:30:36.250]
We still are.

[01:30:36.530 --> 01:30:36.670]
Yep.

[01:30:37.210 --> 01:30:37.750]
And closing.

[01:30:38.330 --> 01:30:40.150]
Rich, you're a bell south working.

[01:30:40.630 --> 01:30:41.610]
Mike Lane, Loven.

[01:30:42.650 --> 01:30:44.450]
Pittsburgh, Penguin, Root and Douche Bay.

[01:30:44.530 --> 01:30:45.230]
Okay, see ya.

[01:30:45.390 --> 01:30:45.610]
Okay.

[01:30:45.610 --> 01:30:47.210]
We have two open lines on the green lines.

[01:30:47.310 --> 01:30:49.310]
1-800-944-9463.

[01:30:49.310 --> 01:30:50.630]
We got one on the purple line there.

[01:30:50.750 --> 01:30:52.250]
Mobile 1-Cell-18-T wireless.

[01:30:52.930 --> 01:30:54.930]
Pound IOD, let's do a Margates gone.

[01:30:55.470 --> 01:30:56.330]
Pound lines gone.

[01:30:56.430 --> 01:30:56.970]
Let's do Miami.

[01:30:57.170 --> 01:30:57.350]
Hello.

[01:30:58.010 --> 01:30:58.270]
Neil.

[01:30:58.450 --> 01:30:58.790]
Yes, sir.

[01:30:58.850 --> 01:30:59.430]
Hey, how you doing?

[01:30:59.550 --> 01:30:59.790]
Okay.

[01:31:00.050 --> 01:31:03.690]
Come on, Panthers are going to win four, you know, to be four three when it's over and done

[01:31:03.690 --> 01:31:03.930]
with.

[01:31:04.070 --> 01:31:04.410]
Panthers.

[01:31:06.130 --> 01:31:08.690]
Anyway, you know, trying to get geared up for the game.

[01:31:09.050 --> 01:31:11.350]
You flick over and try to listen to Defoe.

[01:31:11.670 --> 01:31:12.990]
It's a mad dog.

[01:31:13.850 --> 01:31:14.250]
Exactly.

[01:31:14.250 --> 01:31:18.850]
Have you ever had this pleasure of listening to him give his hockey commentary?

[01:31:19.210 --> 01:31:19.970]
Yeah, it's a joke.

[01:31:20.110 --> 01:31:20.830]
Oh my God.

[01:31:20.970 --> 01:31:25.430]
So in desperation, I mean, I do this maybe once every lunar eclipse.

[01:31:25.590 --> 01:31:27.310]
I flick over to Fat Man.

[01:31:27.690 --> 01:31:27.830]
Yeah.

[01:31:27.930 --> 01:31:29.790]
And he's got, did you catch any of that yesterday?

[01:31:29.790 --> 01:31:30.530]
That's a bigger joke.

[01:31:30.650 --> 01:31:31.150]
No, I didn't know.

[01:31:31.270 --> 01:31:33.110]
Oh my God, he's got Chris Moore in there, right?

[01:31:33.370 --> 01:31:33.370]

[01:31:33.470 --> 01:31:34.610]
This is why I have to call you.

[01:31:34.890 --> 01:31:40.670]
And they're talking about the bad mountain rimmer and how he sucks up to the show.

[01:31:41.190 --> 01:31:42.830]
And I just couldn't take it.

[01:31:42.830 --> 01:31:43.490]
I mean, I get home.

[01:31:43.570 --> 01:31:45.950]
I finally get home in day and get on the phone call up.

[01:31:46.290 --> 01:31:49.950]
And you know, I don't know who the hell their board op is or the producer is.

[01:31:50.010 --> 01:31:50.990]
What do you want to talk about?

[01:31:51.470 --> 01:31:55.810]
I just want to tell Chris Moore, you know, that he's not just he was ripping rimmer left

[01:31:55.810 --> 01:31:56.150]
and right.

[01:31:56.270 --> 01:31:58.470]
You know, you want to get geared up for the game.

[01:31:58.710 --> 01:31:59.370]
I don't believe it.

[01:31:59.450 --> 01:31:59.830]
They're getting.

[01:31:59.830 --> 01:32:00.610]
I don't believe it.

[01:32:00.710 --> 01:32:01.230]
That had happened.

[01:32:01.510 --> 01:32:02.790]
No, maybe Hank was doing it.

[01:32:02.790 --> 01:32:04.070]
Why would Chris Moore be ripping rimmer?

[01:32:04.330 --> 01:32:06.310]
They were both joking back and forth.

[01:32:06.310 --> 01:32:07.990]
And then I don't know who the heck it was.

[01:32:08.270 --> 01:32:09.830]
Did a Godfather impression.

[01:32:10.190 --> 01:32:10.390]
Yeah.

[01:32:10.530 --> 01:32:11.690]
And they were just giggling.

[01:32:11.690 --> 01:32:13.350]
Let me ask you something.

[01:32:13.750 --> 01:32:13.770]
Yeah.

[01:32:13.950 --> 01:32:16.450]
A lot of you people pull the same stuff.

[01:32:16.670 --> 01:32:18.430]
You know, you want to give me a spy report?

[01:32:18.690 --> 01:32:19.630]
No, no, listen to me.

[01:32:19.630 --> 01:32:19.850]
Okay.

[01:32:19.930 --> 01:32:21.770]
And tell me about, I don't really care.

[01:32:21.990 --> 01:32:26.330]
See, and I have tried to tell rimmer why he gets concerned about people like that on

[01:32:26.330 --> 01:32:26.550]
the year.

[01:32:26.710 --> 01:32:28.370]
Why would anybody care what they say?

[01:32:28.590 --> 01:32:29.590]
I don't care what they say.

[01:32:29.630 --> 01:32:30.150]
I know.

[01:32:30.310 --> 01:32:32.150]
But Hank is just a sour, bitter old man.

[01:32:32.270 --> 01:32:32.950]
That's all he is.

[01:32:32.970 --> 01:32:34.490]
Who gives a crap about what he says?

[01:32:34.750 --> 01:32:37.930]
Well, Phil Henry's got more talent is little finger than Hank Oliver had in his head

[01:32:37.930 --> 01:32:38.190]
bottom.

[01:32:38.410 --> 01:32:39.970]
And everybody knows that.

[01:32:40.090 --> 01:32:40.370]
I know.

[01:32:40.370 --> 01:32:44.250]
I get more entertainment listening to Phil trying to run Panther with something.

[01:32:44.390 --> 01:32:47.490]
But in addition to which with all the other stuff that's going on is that the best

[01:32:47.490 --> 01:32:49.150]
that they have to talk about again is rimmer.

[01:32:49.150 --> 01:32:49.790]
And that's what I'm saying.

[01:32:49.950 --> 01:32:54.090]
You know, I'm not going to sit through DFO and the mad dog trying to start her through.

[01:32:54.170 --> 01:32:55.530]
And I want to at least hear something.

[01:32:55.530 --> 01:32:56.790]
Well, you're not, you're not going to hear it.

[01:32:56.790 --> 01:32:57.130]
I know.

[01:32:57.250 --> 01:32:57.330]
I know.

[01:32:57.330 --> 01:32:57.350]
I know.

[01:32:57.350 --> 01:32:57.350]

[01:32:57.350 --> 01:33:00.550]
You only place you'll hear it is right here.

[01:33:00.890 --> 01:33:01.470]
You're the man.

[01:33:01.670 --> 01:33:02.210]
Okay, pal.

[01:33:02.250 --> 01:33:02.610]
Take care.

[01:33:02.670 --> 01:33:02.890]
See you.

[01:33:03.910 --> 01:33:07.310]
I mean, that gets so old and so stale and about the QAM.

[01:33:07.310 --> 01:33:09.810]
Now, this one, Hank said this and the Chris Moore said that.

[01:33:09.810 --> 01:33:11.510]
Nobody cares what they said.

[01:33:11.630 --> 01:33:13.210]
That's why they got the numbers that they've got.

[01:33:13.330 --> 01:33:17.390]
That's why they're like the bottom of any of the bottom of the barrel.

[01:33:17.850 --> 01:33:20.850]
They've been trying and trying and trying for how long have they been in that format?

[01:33:21.150 --> 01:33:23.570]
And they still can't crack a decent number over there.

[01:33:24.950 --> 01:33:27.430]
And they've been auditioning people on here for that morning show.

[01:33:27.550 --> 01:33:29.230]
Like somebody's going to get excited about that.

[01:33:29.490 --> 01:33:31.230]
And all Robbie Needle-Marck, can we get you laid?

[01:33:31.410 --> 01:33:31.870]
Can we get you?

[01:33:31.990 --> 01:33:33.490]
They get out of here with that crap.

[01:33:33.730 --> 01:33:33.910]
Okay.

[01:33:34.530 --> 01:33:36.730]
When we put a show together over here, we talked to Don.

[01:33:36.730 --> 01:33:37.870]
Here we talk to the coach.

[01:33:38.030 --> 01:33:38.970]
We talked to General Manager.

[01:33:39.150 --> 01:33:40.130]
We talked to Bill Thorey.

[01:33:40.130 --> 01:33:41.830]
We find out what the story with Wayne is.

[01:33:42.070 --> 01:33:43.530]
We talk about what's going on.

[01:33:45.050 --> 01:33:48.250]
Who the hell gives a crap about sitting and repeating the obvious about how Chris Moore

[01:33:48.250 --> 01:33:50.350]
thinks and about how Hank is a fat pompous ass.

[01:33:50.630 --> 01:33:52.090]
Who the hell cares about that?

[01:33:52.670 --> 01:33:54.210]
Even if it happens to be true.

[01:33:55.630 --> 01:34:00.870]
But this market man is so goddamn neurotic with the same crap over and over and over again.

[01:34:01.150 --> 01:34:04.230]
And all these cry babies are, oh, ESPN, don't want to give a crap.

[01:34:04.430 --> 01:34:05.850]
Who cares about that?

[01:34:06.450 --> 01:34:10.310]
And all that is is a cover-up for people who are bandwagon, juppers, who know nothing

[01:34:10.310 --> 01:34:14.330]
about the game, who can't discuss what they just got through seeing for two and a half

[01:34:14.330 --> 01:34:15.290]
three hours last night.

[01:34:15.530 --> 01:34:17.530]
But who can tell you that Barry Melrose is an asshole.

[01:34:17.850 --> 01:34:18.810]
We already know that.

[01:34:18.970 --> 01:34:20.350]
I knew that a long time ago.

[01:34:21.030 --> 01:34:24.550]
I knew that three years ago when he was coaching against the Leafs and the goddamn playoffs.

[01:34:24.790 --> 01:34:26.250]
I knew Barry Melrose was an asshole.

[01:34:31.270 --> 01:34:32.890]
123 at WIOD.

[01:34:33.450 --> 01:34:34.930]
Hawking Entertainment Radio.

[01:34:37.390 --> 01:34:38.350]
610, WIOD.

[01:34:38.630 --> 01:34:40.710]
OK, we got a momentous occasion just happened.

[01:34:40.850 --> 01:34:44.510]
Woody Graber finally waddled in here and he's got tickets for the hockey games.

[01:34:44.630 --> 01:34:46.170]
OK, he's got all these great tickets here.

[01:34:46.190 --> 01:34:46.890]
They look really good.

[01:34:47.630 --> 01:34:48.530]
Here they are.

[01:34:48.770 --> 01:34:49.510]
They're even legitimate.

[01:34:50.070 --> 01:34:50.950]
Yeah, they're even for real.

[01:34:51.050 --> 01:34:52.170]
OK, these aren't the bogus.

[01:34:52.190 --> 01:34:52.970]
These aren't counterfeit.

[01:34:53.510 --> 01:34:59.650]
And it says use the game J-ticket for the game on 24th this Friday and for Sunday G.K.

[01:35:00.550 --> 01:35:04.730]
And in game six of the series if it's necessary, L, which he will be.

[01:35:05.670 --> 01:35:06.450]
So there you go.

[01:35:06.730 --> 01:35:07.350]
They look great.

[01:35:07.490 --> 01:35:07.870]
Thanks, Woody.

[01:35:08.030 --> 01:35:10.590]
He's named out about him because he wants to act like a big shot.

[01:35:11.190 --> 01:35:12.630]
OK, we have an open line on a green line.

[01:35:12.790 --> 01:35:14.670]
1-800-944-4-6-3.

[01:35:14.730 --> 01:35:18.970]
And of course if Bob Green doesn't show up, you can probably, you know, exactly get

[01:35:18.970 --> 01:35:19.930]
some serious bucks for those.

[01:35:20.470 --> 01:35:22.930]
OK, let's go to some to Bud Paxon.

[01:35:23.190 --> 01:35:23.930]
Let's go to Davy.

[01:35:24.010 --> 01:35:24.170]
Hello.

[01:35:24.170 --> 01:35:28.470]
If I had ever, I'd have ever at the board.

[01:35:30.250 --> 01:35:31.270]
Oh my god.

[01:35:31.410 --> 01:35:33.910]
If you play Hank Goldberg again, I'm going to throw up.

[01:35:34.170 --> 01:35:34.750]
Here's Miami.

[01:35:34.790 --> 01:35:35.130]
Hello.

[01:35:35.450 --> 01:35:35.990]
How are you doing?

[01:35:36.250 --> 01:35:36.490]
OK.

[01:35:36.790 --> 01:35:38.010]
I start the caverncy interview.

[01:35:38.250 --> 01:35:38.590]
Brilliant.

[01:35:39.470 --> 01:35:40.190]
Absolutely brilliant.

[01:35:40.350 --> 01:35:42.290]
These freaking churches sending missionaries everywhere.

[01:35:42.530 --> 01:35:43.370]
It's philosophical warfare.

[01:35:44.210 --> 01:35:44.450]
Yeah.

[01:35:44.670 --> 01:35:45.490]
They're not dropping bombs.

[01:35:45.650 --> 01:35:47.110]
They're just dropping diseases all over the world.

[01:35:47.210 --> 01:35:48.090]
They're telling the species.

[01:35:48.090 --> 01:35:48.770]
Not the race.

[01:35:48.810 --> 01:35:49.670]
Do you hear me out there?

[01:35:50.050 --> 01:35:50.590]
The species.

[01:35:50.870 --> 01:35:51.330]
It's business.

[01:35:51.730 --> 01:35:52.490]
Yeah, something like that.

[01:35:52.490 --> 01:35:53.530]
They make a lot of money, don't they?

[01:35:54.850 --> 01:35:58.090]
Anyway, I had my buddies over here screaming, go panthers.

[01:35:58.350 --> 01:35:58.950]
I had the cavern.

[01:35:59.130 --> 01:36:00.150]
You want to know it's in the box.

[01:36:00.350 --> 01:36:01.610]
It's Hank Goldberg's stomach.

[01:36:02.070 --> 01:36:02.350]
OK.

[01:36:02.750 --> 01:36:05.110]
And Hank, could I scum for some panther tickets?

[01:36:05.750 --> 01:36:08.270]
I didn't even know you were going to give them away, but you just said panther tickets.

[01:36:08.670 --> 01:36:14.790]
We have an open line in day, 7519-463, one on a blue line in Broward, 5249-463, and one on

[01:36:14.790 --> 01:36:15.810]
a green line in Palm Beach.

[01:36:15.810 --> 01:36:16.830]
It looks like three of them to me.

[01:36:17.150 --> 01:36:19.790]
I mean, we should have a pretty captive audience out there today, just for more

[01:36:19.790 --> 01:36:23.430]
seeing on a goddamn weather channel right now, which I wasn't paying too much attention.

[01:36:23.730 --> 01:36:25.610]
The goddamn world is coming to an end out there.

[01:36:25.710 --> 01:36:26.230]
How do you like that?

[01:36:26.510 --> 01:36:30.090]
And I'm sitting here and everybody acts like it's just another normal goddamn day.

[01:36:30.590 --> 01:36:32.230]
That guy is falling.

[01:36:32.770 --> 01:36:35.570]
So anyway, I have my panther tickets, like I said, OK?

[01:36:35.890 --> 01:36:36.770]
Not for you guys.

[01:36:37.030 --> 01:36:42.510]
I have my goddamn Florida panther playoff tickets right here, and you're not getting them,

[01:36:42.550 --> 01:36:42.810]
OK?

[01:36:43.530 --> 01:36:47.510]
And this guy who just called only moments ago, I hope very seriously he's only joking.

[01:36:47.830 --> 01:36:48.370]
I hope.

[01:36:49.650 --> 01:36:50.330]
Here's Miami.

[01:36:50.530 --> 01:36:50.730]
Hello.

[01:36:51.370 --> 01:36:51.810]
Neil.

[01:36:52.050 --> 01:36:52.350]
Yes, sir.

[01:36:53.210 --> 01:36:54.470]
Watch the hockey game, I said.

[01:36:54.590 --> 01:36:57.290]
I'm not a hockey fan, but it was very exciting.

[01:36:58.190 --> 01:37:04.110]
And I hear you talking about how on Fox, I have this thing to help you watch the puck.

[01:37:04.490 --> 01:37:04.710]
Yeah.

[01:37:05.190 --> 01:37:09.650]
I've never watched hockey, almost never watched it before in my life, but there's no problem.

[01:37:09.770 --> 01:37:11.290]
There is no problem seeing the puck.

[01:37:11.490 --> 01:37:13.910]
Even Ray Charles can see it just as well as anybody else.

[01:37:14.010 --> 01:37:15.650]
There's no problem following the puck.

[01:37:15.650 --> 01:37:23.230]
Look, if the camera work is good, which on CBC, it's great, the others, you know, but if the camera work is good, there's no problem following the puck.

[01:37:23.470 --> 01:37:25.110]
Yeah, that's thing number one.

[01:37:25.250 --> 01:37:30.630]
Thing number two is when they were playing the tapes when you were on vacation, they were worst.

[01:37:30.890 --> 01:37:31.670]
They were worst.

[01:37:31.850 --> 01:37:31.970]
Yeah.

[01:37:32.330 --> 01:37:35.630]
Why are we playing tapes from three and four years ago by the way, George?

[01:37:35.750 --> 01:37:37.030]
It's one useful thing in it.

[01:37:37.350 --> 01:37:37.550]
Yeah.

[01:37:37.790 --> 01:37:40.270]
There was a tape of a couple of guys.

[01:37:40.270 --> 01:37:41.770]
Because we ran out of new ones.

[01:37:42.990 --> 01:37:43.490]
Go ahead.

[01:37:43.630 --> 01:37:51.670]
I had a coffee at a service station and it said, you were great doing topics and you said, you know, quite rightly.

[01:37:51.830 --> 01:37:53.570]
No, it was not an old guy.

[01:37:53.990 --> 01:37:54.270]
Okay.

[01:37:54.570 --> 01:37:57.150]
No, I was at a shell station over there on Oakland Park Boulevard.

[01:37:57.310 --> 01:38:00.850]
It was like yesterday and this guy says, oh, yeah, you used to be really good.

[01:38:01.010 --> 01:38:03.230]
I like Al Rantel, you ought to listen to him more often.

[01:38:03.410 --> 01:38:04.670]
And I just went ballistic.

[01:38:04.990 --> 01:38:06.550]
Well, that brings me to what I'm telling you.

[01:38:06.550 --> 01:38:07.350]
What an asshole.

[01:38:07.350 --> 01:38:08.010]
Okay.

[01:38:08.810 --> 01:38:11.730]
He said, this guy said, well, you were great on Merritt Steerheim.

[01:38:11.730 --> 01:38:12.630]
You really exposed him.

[01:38:13.090 --> 01:38:15.110]
Now Merritt Steerheim is trying to make a comeback.

[01:38:15.650 --> 01:38:19.810]
And I would love to know what the, what the dope was on him.

[01:38:19.970 --> 01:38:24.250]
Oh, I don't care about Merritt Steerheim or Joe Carrillo or any of these guys.

[01:38:24.370 --> 01:38:25.710]
It's not even worth talking about.

[01:38:26.290 --> 01:38:28.510]
This, this town, there's no politics in this town.

[01:38:28.510 --> 01:38:29.390]
It's just bull crap.

[01:38:30.430 --> 01:38:33.330]
Well, he is making a move, right?

[01:38:33.450 --> 01:38:35.190]
Well, I hope he makes a big move.

[01:38:35.190 --> 01:38:38.470]
Just like Merriol, I hope he makes a big gigantic dent in a porcelain bus.

[01:38:38.610 --> 01:38:38.870]
Okay.

[01:38:38.990 --> 01:38:40.730]
I'm not interested in any of that crap.

[01:38:40.890 --> 01:38:42.270]
It's a waste of time in his town.

[01:38:42.550 --> 01:38:47.690]
It's the same bunch of Yahoo Rednecks and Julios that I've been running this town for the last 30 years.

[01:38:47.690 --> 01:38:48.790]
It's not going to change.

[01:38:49.250 --> 01:38:52.210]
Any place you could send me to find some information.

[01:38:52.690 --> 01:38:53.490]
Look over it.

[01:38:53.570 --> 01:38:54.550]
Look in the herald, okay?

[01:38:54.830 --> 01:38:55.330]
How long ago?

[01:38:56.290 --> 01:38:56.690]
Steerheim?

[01:38:56.970 --> 01:38:57.150]
Yeah.

[01:38:57.510 --> 01:38:58.650]
I haven't got any idea.

[01:38:58.750 --> 01:38:58.950]
All right.

[01:38:59.030 --> 01:38:59.230]
Thanks.

[01:38:59.370 --> 01:38:59.990]
Good luck to you, pal.

[01:39:00.310 --> 01:39:01.070]
Oh, Jesus.

[01:39:01.290 --> 01:39:02.090]
God and Merri.

[01:39:02.890 --> 01:39:04.010]
Oh, Jesus.

[01:39:04.770 --> 01:39:08.130]
That's like that guy that called a couple of days ago, is how that old fart.

[01:39:08.470 --> 01:39:08.890]
Oh, yeah.

[01:39:09.010 --> 01:39:12.690]
When you used to do topics, talk about not being politically correct.

[01:39:12.750 --> 01:39:14.390]
Galara, talk about the light bulb.

[01:39:14.670 --> 01:39:16.650]
You folks will be delighted, like this last guy.

[01:39:16.690 --> 01:39:20.610]
He'll be ecstatic when the light bulb winds up on his frequency so they can hear it.

[01:39:21.390 --> 01:39:26.230]
And you can listen to Rick Ciderman, and Alice Rantell, and Steve Cain, Mr. Ego.

[01:39:26.410 --> 01:39:32.550]
You can listen to all that same crap hour after hour, and hear the voices of these old dying people taking their last breath.

[01:39:32.550 --> 01:39:35.470]
You can hear the, the, the, the death rattle in the background.

[01:39:36.170 --> 01:39:37.290]
Like that you can hear it.

[01:39:38.690 --> 01:39:44.530]
The day that I go back to that crap will be the day just before I go out there with a goddamn tin cup and a sign on the street corner.

[01:39:44.570 --> 01:39:48.110]
You can bet your bottom dollar on that no chance, no way Jose.

[01:39:48.790 --> 01:39:49.850]
Merri, queer, heim.

[01:39:49.910 --> 01:39:50.510]
Forget about it.

[01:39:50.550 --> 01:39:50.770]
Okay.

[01:39:50.850 --> 01:39:51.450]
Give it a rest.

[01:39:52.070 --> 01:39:53.910]
All these yokel politicians here.

[01:39:53.930 --> 01:39:54.510]
It's not even worth.

[01:39:54.670 --> 01:39:55.890]
I wouldn't fart in their face.

[01:39:56.010 --> 01:39:58.170]
That's the amount of energy I would have for these guys.

[01:39:58.390 --> 01:39:59.210]
It's a joke.

[01:39:59.790 --> 01:40:03.430]
That's why this town is still a goddamn horse and buggy town in a stone age.

[01:40:04.670 --> 01:40:05.790]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[01:40:05.830 --> 01:40:06.170]
Hello.

[01:40:07.610 --> 01:40:08.310]
Yeah, Neil.

[01:40:08.450 --> 01:40:08.790]
Yes, sir.

[01:40:08.950 --> 01:40:09.470]
How you doing?

[01:40:09.650 --> 01:40:09.930]
Okay.

[01:40:10.210 --> 01:40:11.570]
I've got a couple questions.

[01:40:11.850 --> 01:40:14.290]
One on the hockey, I'm watching TV the other day.

[01:40:14.910 --> 01:40:21.110]
And what is this thing where they always do a close-up of a player after the hit has taken place.

[01:40:21.370 --> 01:40:22.610]
And meanwhile, play is going on.

[01:40:22.750 --> 01:40:23.310]
I hate that.

[01:40:23.550 --> 01:40:24.690]
Hey, thanks Woody.

[01:40:25.070 --> 01:40:25.510]
I hate that.

[01:40:25.790 --> 01:40:26.630]
It drives me nuts.

[01:40:26.950 --> 01:40:28.470]
I want to see the game.

[01:40:28.470 --> 01:40:28.850]
Okay.

[01:40:29.010 --> 01:40:31.870]
And I'm going to tell you something that was really embarrassing last night.

[01:40:31.870 --> 01:40:33.630]
And John Shannon at the CBC.

[01:40:34.070 --> 01:40:40.050]
I hope somebody who knows you was listening right now because at the beginning of the second period or the beginning of the third period,

[01:40:40.050 --> 01:40:40.850]
we're down to nothing.

[01:40:40.850 --> 01:40:42.530]
And we score 30 seconds in, right?

[01:40:42.630 --> 01:40:44.630]
Jovanski takes the shot and shepherds it in.

[01:40:45.110 --> 01:40:45.550]
Right.

[01:40:45.550 --> 01:40:46.750]
They you saw the picture.

[01:40:47.030 --> 01:40:54.470]
But but the audio they got Ron McClain taped an interview with Dave Roche of the penguins in between the second and third period.

[01:40:54.470 --> 01:40:55.970]
And they're showing that tape.

[01:40:56.230 --> 01:41:02.390]
And now of course, is when the game starts, we still hear the audio of him talking to Dave Roche while the game is going on.

[01:41:02.730 --> 01:41:04.810]
Chris Cuthbert doesn't get any chance to call a goal.

[01:41:05.170 --> 01:41:08.410]
And this goes on for like 20 or 30 seconds after the goal has been scored.

[01:41:08.710 --> 01:41:09.430]
It drives me nuts.

[01:41:09.590 --> 01:41:11.130]
The absolutely unacceptable.

[01:41:11.370 --> 01:41:14.790]
Okay. All this minutiae, there's plenty of time in between periods.

[01:41:14.910 --> 01:41:16.430]
There's plenty of time in between action.

[01:41:16.870 --> 01:41:18.470]
Don't do it while the game is going on.

[01:41:18.570 --> 01:41:20.130]
It's absolutely unacceptable.

[01:41:20.390 --> 01:41:21.470]
It's it's it's grotesque.

[01:41:21.570 --> 01:41:29.670]
And the other thing is when the player mishandles the puck and they refer to it as they usually fan or with or mishandle the puck.

[01:41:29.750 --> 01:41:30.310]
Isn't that correct?

[01:41:30.490 --> 01:41:30.650]
Yeah.

[01:41:31.070 --> 01:41:32.950]
Well did you know what Joe the gackie called it?

[01:41:33.810 --> 01:41:35.650]
He said they fumbled the puck.

[01:41:35.830 --> 01:41:36.250]
Fumbled it.

[01:41:36.330 --> 01:41:38.430]
Yeah. It's like when they fan on the football.

[01:41:38.770 --> 01:41:38.930]
Right.

[01:41:39.290 --> 01:41:39.390]
Right.

[01:41:40.150 --> 01:41:41.990]
That Joe he knows his crap man.

[01:41:42.170 --> 01:41:44.030]
In fact, he was right in there with Mario last night.

[01:41:44.770 --> 01:41:45.810]
Have a great day pal.

[01:41:46.270 --> 01:41:46.670]
Yeah.

[01:41:46.670 --> 01:41:46.730]
Yeah.

[01:41:46.850 --> 01:41:49.110]
Joe said, oh, I can relate to the game now because I know my crap.

[01:41:49.230 --> 01:41:51.350]
And Mario said, hey, here's some more for you Joe.

[01:41:51.590 --> 01:41:52.070]
Mr. eyebrows.

[01:41:53.010 --> 01:42:00.870]
That's what's really a joke is all these people who know absolutely nothing about it in the local media, which is most of them now trying to be posers now pretending to know something about it.

[01:42:00.990 --> 01:42:02.430]
Oh, here's Joe up there in Pittsburgh.

[01:42:02.670 --> 01:42:02.790]
Yeah.

[01:42:02.830 --> 01:42:03.010]
Yeah.

[01:42:03.130 --> 01:42:03.790]
And what?

[01:42:05.750 --> 01:42:06.750]
Give us some meat.

[01:42:06.950 --> 01:42:07.830]
Give us some information.

[01:42:07.970 --> 01:42:08.590]
Give us something.

[01:42:08.710 --> 01:42:08.970]
Anything.

[01:42:09.310 --> 01:42:11.810]
Pretend you know something pal, because you don't.

[01:42:11.810 --> 01:42:14.310]
The same guy that was on there, ranting and raving.

[01:42:14.530 --> 01:42:16.250]
Don't put any hockey calls on here.

[01:42:16.370 --> 01:42:16.790]
It's boring.

[01:42:16.910 --> 01:42:17.990]
Nobody cares about it.

[01:42:18.150 --> 01:42:18.470]
Right.

[01:42:19.070 --> 01:42:19.910]
You schmuck.

[01:42:20.290 --> 01:42:21.790]
You putts with ears and eyebrows.

[01:42:22.270 --> 01:42:24.470]
He's just a walk in putts with big eyebrows.

[01:42:24.470 --> 01:42:25.310]
That's all he is.

[01:42:26.690 --> 01:42:27.910]
Oh, you look lovely in that.

[01:42:27.990 --> 01:42:29.770]
You got a little trim there too from Miriam.

[01:42:30.170 --> 01:42:32.130]
Oh, Miriam's making around here inside the building.

[01:42:32.170 --> 01:42:35.310]
She's, uh, she's doing everybody today and her cuts too.

[01:42:35.890 --> 01:42:37.030]
It's the trim lady.

[01:42:38.570 --> 01:42:40.870]
So anyway, it's 135 at WIOD.

[01:43:06.150 --> 01:43:08.330]
All right, ladies, gather around.

[01:43:08.510 --> 01:43:09.430]
The band is ready.

[01:43:09.430 --> 01:43:14.490]
On the count of three, one, two, three.

[01:43:14.610 --> 01:43:21.190]
From the grassy courts at Wilton to the bars where we all play.

[01:43:21.910 --> 01:43:25.430]
We are angry, dice, school battle.

[01:43:26.210 --> 01:43:29.370]
Those who are anti-gay.

[01:43:29.890 --> 01:43:33.590]
Sure here for both browsed back as this.

[01:43:33.830 --> 01:43:35.630]
We struck on our rubber.

[01:43:36.730 --> 01:43:44.410]
We declare to all old colonists that we will get in our legs.

[01:43:44.770 --> 01:43:48.850]
Our houses are all humming.

[01:43:49.310 --> 01:43:51.810]
Our batteries are full.

[01:43:52.930 --> 01:43:59.410]
We make our choices fairly as to who will push or pull.

[01:44:00.190 --> 01:44:07.590]
And we say to you, Republicans, some shirts print too much stars.

[01:44:07.950 --> 01:44:15.070]
We will gather soon in Washington for the million-class Mars.

[01:44:15.690 --> 01:44:16.710]
Excuse me, soldier.

[01:44:16.990 --> 01:44:19.410]
Are you from Rotor-Root or are you just happy to say me?

[01:44:19.970 --> 01:44:21.250]
141 at WIOD.

[01:44:21.410 --> 01:44:23.690]
Is that a banana in your pants or are you happy to see me, Pat?

[01:44:24.830 --> 01:44:28.250]
So anyway, George is sitting on Miriam's lap in there and the chair is revolving around.

[01:44:28.250 --> 01:44:29.670]
Just like something out of talk radio.

[01:44:30.090 --> 01:44:32.610]
I have to sit here and watch this craft.

[01:44:32.810 --> 01:44:33.530]
This is unacceptable.

[01:44:33.770 --> 01:44:34.550]
Get J.C. in here.

[01:44:35.730 --> 01:44:37.270]
Here's a mobile and four-lotter deal.

[01:44:37.450 --> 01:44:37.570]
Hello.

[01:44:38.530 --> 01:44:38.830]
Yes, sir.

[01:44:39.590 --> 01:44:43.330]
I wonder if anybody else got in a fight with their girlfriend over the hockey game.

[01:44:43.430 --> 01:44:44.410]
We got thrown out of the house.

[01:44:45.050 --> 01:44:45.250]
Really?

[01:44:45.550 --> 01:44:47.870]
Yeah, Melrose plays two-hour special.

[01:44:48.090 --> 01:44:50.350]
Take Melrose plays in Todd's shovel in her ass.

[01:44:50.510 --> 01:44:51.250]
I'm from Boston.

[01:44:51.450 --> 01:44:53.850]
I wanted to watch the hockey game play hockey all my life.

[01:44:53.850 --> 01:44:54.110]
Right?

[01:44:54.490 --> 01:44:56.090]
I'm going to be out by the end of the month now.

[01:44:56.630 --> 01:44:58.170]
We got a big fight last night.

[01:44:58.330 --> 01:44:59.330]
Well, you luck out, man.

[01:44:59.770 --> 01:44:59.970]
Yeah.

[01:45:00.170 --> 01:45:01.170]
You ought to kiss the ground.

[01:45:01.410 --> 01:45:01.630]
Yep.

[01:45:02.170 --> 01:45:03.630]
But I just want to say about Mario.

[01:45:04.250 --> 01:45:06.850]
That play he got taken down, he's still got the shot off.

[01:45:06.870 --> 01:45:07.570]
Yeah, incredible.

[01:45:07.710 --> 01:45:08.070]
Unbelievable.

[01:45:08.290 --> 01:45:11.590]
Only he and Yager are struggling to do that.

[01:45:12.010 --> 01:45:12.610]
All right, buddy.

[01:45:12.810 --> 01:45:13.610]
Go back there, thank you.

[01:45:13.630 --> 01:45:14.470]
Okay, did's the bitch.

[01:45:14.810 --> 01:45:14.910]
Bye.

[01:45:15.370 --> 01:45:19.370]
Here's a lucky guy who got rid of some smelly bitch that they wanted to rock that Melrose plays.

[01:45:19.610 --> 01:45:20.670]
Give me a break.

[01:45:20.670 --> 01:45:22.510]
I think will you get a life with that crap already?

[01:45:22.790 --> 01:45:25.390]
Same old tired crap over and over again?

[01:45:25.750 --> 01:45:26.190]
Jesus.

[01:45:27.390 --> 01:45:28.450]
Here's the West Kendall.

[01:45:28.450 --> 01:45:28.830]
Hello.

[01:45:29.470 --> 01:45:30.130]
Yes, sir.

[01:45:30.190 --> 01:45:33.350]
Hey, don't talk about that Dr. Kavorki interview on Sunday.

[01:45:33.630 --> 01:45:33.810]
Yeah.

[01:45:34.050 --> 01:45:36.070]
You know, he requested Andy Rooney.

[01:45:36.250 --> 01:45:36.630]
I know that.

[01:45:36.710 --> 01:45:37.870]
The only way he'd do that interview.

[01:45:38.170 --> 01:45:43.310]
But that's like Miles and that's why I pick and quirky over Murphy Brown to do something important.

[01:45:44.170 --> 01:45:46.990]
20 years from now, this guy's going to be a hero.

[01:45:47.470 --> 01:45:48.510]
He's a hero now.

[01:45:48.510 --> 01:45:51.130]
He's not doing anything new.

[01:45:51.510 --> 01:45:53.990]
Doctors have been doing this privately for a long time.

[01:45:53.990 --> 01:45:54.410]
That's right.

[01:45:54.870 --> 01:45:58.630]
He's the only one that has the balls to come out and say it.

[01:45:58.650 --> 01:46:01.470]
I mean, where the hell does the government have a business telling you that if you want to die,

[01:46:01.590 --> 01:46:02.550]
you don't have the right to die.

[01:46:02.690 --> 01:46:03.590]
What kind of crap is that?

[01:46:03.670 --> 01:46:08.210]
All these religious assholes, man, they'll tell you they're going to decide when you can, you know, it's a bunch of bull crap.

[01:46:08.430 --> 01:46:15.390]
You have a right to die, but the insurance companies have an IV hooked up to your bank account when it goes below $200.

[01:46:15.950 --> 01:46:19.390]
A signal is sent to the hospital and then you're disposable.

[01:46:19.790 --> 01:46:19.790]

[01:46:19.990 --> 01:46:26.850]
Not until every bit of money and property in your family and wherever else is related to you that they can suck dry,

[01:46:27.030 --> 01:46:30.350]
then you can go buy, buy, you know, see you later.

[01:46:30.430 --> 01:46:32.230]
No, they can't suck you anymore.

[01:46:32.350 --> 01:46:33.310]
That's when you're dispensable.

[01:46:33.410 --> 01:46:40.630]
No. And then in the interview, Andy Rooney making a remarkable segue says, so Jack, what do you do for fun?

[01:46:42.170 --> 01:46:45.850]
And then he says, where did you get that soup? It's got a nice shine on it.

[01:46:46.010 --> 01:46:46.230]
Yeah.

[01:46:46.490 --> 01:46:54.550]
So we went from people dying mercifully and the other subject to what he does for fun and where did you get his sports check?

[01:46:54.910 --> 01:46:55.190]
Oh!

[01:46:55.870 --> 01:46:56.470]
I like it.

[01:46:56.550 --> 01:46:57.690]
So Mike Wallace, he's not.

[01:46:58.750 --> 01:46:59.730]
Hey, listen, I love it.

[01:47:00.610 --> 01:47:00.990]
I don't know.

[01:47:01.470 --> 01:47:06.890]
Like I said, 20 years from now, this man will be written up in books. He's the pioneer. He's the first one to come out and say,

[01:47:06.890 --> 01:47:10.830]
this is the humane way to do this.

[01:47:11.290 --> 01:47:11.290]

[01:47:11.490 --> 01:47:14.830]
Doctors all over the place privately agree with him.

[01:47:14.910 --> 01:47:17.590]
Yeah, but they don't have the balls to come out and say it.

[01:47:17.710 --> 01:47:18.750]
You got it. Thanks, Neil.

[01:47:18.830 --> 01:47:19.290]
Okay, pal.

[01:47:20.470 --> 01:47:22.010]
That's right. He's the only one.

[01:47:24.010 --> 01:47:26.830]
He's the only one that stands up for, you know, it's so ridiculous.

[01:47:27.190 --> 01:47:32.190]
These assholes, you know, of course it's part of this whole fanatical religionist anyway, just like he evidently was talking about.

[01:47:32.190 --> 01:47:43.970]
They're going to tell you about the fetus and they're going to tell you about when you can croak and they're going to tell you every goddamn thing you can do and who you can have sex with and which part you can touch and which part you can't touch and which hand you should use and where to stick it and all this other crap.

[01:47:44.170 --> 01:47:45.630]
Mind your own goddamn business.

[01:47:45.990 --> 01:47:49.510]
That's the bottom line for all these fanatical nuts out there. Stop being a Yanta, okay?

[01:47:50.670 --> 01:47:53.550]
Go feed some starving people and stop worrying about being a Yanta.

[01:47:54.390 --> 01:47:55.890]
Here's a lady in Palm Beach. Hello.

[01:47:56.090 --> 01:47:56.970]
Hello. How are you?

[01:47:57.130 --> 01:47:57.510]
I'm great.

[01:47:57.870 --> 01:47:59.470]
You know, I love this panther talk.

[01:47:59.470 --> 01:47:59.970]
Yeah.

[01:48:00.050 --> 01:48:02.070]
Great. I love it. Love in the game.

[01:48:02.330 --> 01:48:08.990]
I only wish we had some more intelligent discussion about it, but unfortunately, you know, most of the people that are yapping or they don't know what they're talking about.

[01:48:09.250 --> 01:48:17.950]
Well, we just don't have knowledgeable people here. I mean, it's great that at least at least we're getting enough enthusiasm now that some people might come to some more games and learn what it's all about.

[01:48:18.190 --> 01:48:26.470]
But most of the people are just basically peridating the same thing that everybody else is saying about how ESPN is very biased and they're unfair to us and their coverage stands.

[01:48:26.470 --> 01:48:29.830]
You know, after you hear that the first 200 times, it's not very interesting anymore.

[01:48:29.850 --> 01:48:34.090]
That's true. I just wanted to mention real quick about Coach of the Year.

[01:48:34.450 --> 01:48:35.750]
Yeah. I don't think...

[01:48:35.750 --> 01:48:39.810]
Hey, if Doug McLean don't get Coach of the Year, I'm declaring war on Canada. I'll tell you that right now.

[01:48:40.290 --> 01:48:42.990]
I have a feeling he's not going to get it. I'm a guy from Colorado.

[01:48:43.550 --> 01:48:46.650]
No way. No, he's not even one of the three nominees.

[01:48:47.310 --> 01:48:47.870]
Are you sure?

[01:48:48.130 --> 01:48:48.710]
I'm positive.

[01:48:49.050 --> 01:48:49.930]
I had a...

[01:48:49.930 --> 01:48:55.290]
No, you're wrong. Scottie, Bowman, Terry, Crisp and Doug McLean are the three finalists.

[01:48:55.290 --> 01:48:57.850]
Oh, good, because I was starting to get worried there.

[01:48:57.930 --> 01:48:58.350]
No chance.

[01:48:58.730 --> 01:49:01.230]
Okay. Well, as long as you say it, then it must be true.

[01:49:01.290 --> 01:49:06.330]
By me, I know he's got no chance because they have three nominees in every category and Mark Crawford's not one of them.

[01:49:06.750 --> 01:49:08.910]
Okay, and when do they decide that anyway?

[01:49:09.250 --> 01:49:11.750]
They just have to the playoffs, then they'll announce all the things.

[01:49:11.990 --> 01:49:16.290]
Okay. Okay, Neil. It's been great. Listen to you. Keep it up and...

[01:49:16.950 --> 01:49:19.010]
Mandate, Shin Melrose. Stick it up, you're ass.

[01:49:19.190 --> 01:49:24.870]
All right. We have an open line on the Green Line, 1-800-944. It's 146 at WIOD.

[01:49:25.870 --> 01:49:27.790]
Use talking entertainment radio.

[01:49:27.870 --> 01:49:29.270]
Use talking entertainment radio.

[01:49:29.510 --> 01:49:32.230]
610-W-I-O-D.

[01:49:32.510 --> 01:49:34.570]
Mr. Mary Crawford, jeez.

[01:49:35.890 --> 01:49:39.830]
I just can't wait until my book's all loses.

[01:49:40.110 --> 01:49:40.330]
Oh!

[01:49:40.930 --> 01:49:46.810]
When no nation chooses, we's got to ride on Dennis, you're supposed to.

[01:49:47.290 --> 01:49:49.550]
We stomach in for three stages.

[01:49:50.550 --> 01:49:52.710]
We've got to watch his rabbit loses.

[01:49:53.410 --> 01:49:55.790]
Your mind is well-voked for me.

[01:49:56.670 --> 01:49:59.050]
Your mind is well-voked for me.

[01:49:59.210 --> 01:50:01.290]
I've got no interest in politics.

[01:50:02.250 --> 01:50:04.510]
The Robert Dold just kind of makes me sick.

[01:50:04.530 --> 01:50:05.690]
Nobody's already been there, nobody's been there.

[01:50:05.710 --> 01:50:07.790]
Who bad there isn't someone else to pick?

[01:50:08.430 --> 01:50:11.070]
Because he reminds me of Tricky Dick.

[01:50:12.070 --> 01:50:15.410]
That's why I'm betting that Robert Dold loses.

[01:50:16.370 --> 01:50:18.470]
When no nation chooses.

[01:50:18.830 --> 01:50:19.310]
Oh my God.

[01:50:19.310 --> 01:50:21.890]
A lot of people say he's ruthless.

[01:50:22.530 --> 01:50:25.310]
His campaign banner recruits it.

[01:50:26.150 --> 01:50:28.450]
He's gonna watch his rabbit lose it.

[01:50:29.430 --> 01:50:31.230]
Your mind is well-voked for me.

[01:50:32.210 --> 01:50:34.570]
Your mind is well-voked for me.

[01:50:34.750 --> 01:50:36.930]
I know that Clinton isn't as tall.

[01:50:37.590 --> 01:50:40.110]
And for that matter, so is Ross Perot.

[01:50:40.750 --> 01:50:43.370]
But I just cannot bear for a rob or dog.

[01:50:44.530 --> 01:50:46.650]
Everybody says he's too old.

[01:50:47.290 --> 01:50:50.950]
That's why I'm telling you Robert Dold loses.

[01:50:51.690 --> 01:50:54.110]
When no nation chooses.

[01:50:55.110 --> 01:51:00.610]
He's done what's gonna do with both playing and you are stupid.

[01:51:01.530 --> 01:51:03.830]
He's gonna watch his rabbit loses.

[01:51:05.030 --> 01:51:06.750]
Your mind is well-voked for me.

[01:51:07.770 --> 01:51:10.230]
Your mind is well-voked for me.

[01:51:10.790 --> 01:51:13.250]
Mostly sunny, high in the mid-70s in Rome today.

[01:51:13.390 --> 01:51:15.570]
I just thought I would mention that since it's not one of our better days.

[01:51:16.370 --> 01:51:18.130]
152 at WIOD.

[01:51:18.310 --> 01:51:19.070]
Here's Weston.

[01:51:19.290 --> 01:51:19.570]
Hello.

[01:51:20.830 --> 01:51:21.310]
Hello.

[01:51:21.590 --> 01:51:21.930]
Yes, sir.

[01:51:22.070 --> 01:51:22.390]
How are you?

[01:51:22.810 --> 01:51:27.570]
I just wanted to say how nice it was to hear from Judy Hall's wife last night.

[01:51:28.410 --> 01:51:29.350]
Yesterday, I mean.

[01:51:29.470 --> 01:51:30.490]
Yeah, whatever that was.

[01:51:32.910 --> 01:51:33.870]
That's courage.

[01:51:34.210 --> 01:51:37.710]
Usually, I heard from any other wives call up or even players.

[01:51:39.150 --> 01:51:42.070]
And she's so quiet when she leaves the bill.

[01:51:42.070 --> 01:51:45.510]
We always think that she's just kind of standoff as she doesn't want to talk to anybody.

[01:51:45.830 --> 01:51:46.950]
But she's got a nice sense of humor.

[01:51:47.690 --> 01:51:49.690]
And I hope she comes by to say hello to us.

[01:51:49.830 --> 01:51:52.630]
We all wait your favorite person to blame on her girl and everybody.

[01:51:53.030 --> 01:51:54.730]
Maybe it's her Stevie I'sman blow up.

[01:51:54.750 --> 01:51:55.650]
I'll scare her away.

[01:51:55.810 --> 01:51:55.970]
Yeah.

[01:51:56.530 --> 01:52:01.010]
She don't want her following her after the game since she gets too close to Judy at the beginning.

[01:52:01.030 --> 01:52:04.150]
Well, I know that my wife drools after her husband.

[01:52:04.470 --> 01:52:05.530]
But I...

[01:52:05.530 --> 01:52:06.630]
Yeah, Judy's a pretty good-looking guy.

[01:52:06.770 --> 01:52:07.390]
I think I look...

[01:52:07.390 --> 01:52:07.930]
Don't touch.

[01:52:08.130 --> 01:52:09.150]
Just look, but don't touch.

[01:52:09.230 --> 01:52:09.570]
There you go.

[01:52:09.570 --> 01:52:10.810]
Well, he looks good with that go-t.

[01:52:11.090 --> 01:52:11.290]
Yeah.

[01:52:11.810 --> 01:52:13.830]
What's your feelings since you...

[01:52:14.710 --> 01:52:17.030]
You probably seem barato play a lot more.

[01:52:17.110 --> 01:52:18.510]
I've only been in this for three years now.

[01:52:18.530 --> 01:52:18.670]
Yeah.

[01:52:20.070 --> 01:52:20.430]
What...

[01:52:20.430 --> 01:52:22.270]
How do you think they should attack him?

[01:52:22.670 --> 01:52:25.730]
He looked very sloppy in there and there's got to be a way to get...

[01:52:25.730 --> 01:52:26.970]
What do you mean he looked sloppy?

[01:52:27.250 --> 01:52:27.890]
I don't know what you mean by that.

[01:52:27.890 --> 01:52:30.590]
He was out of the net a lot.

[01:52:30.730 --> 01:52:32.830]
Well, he handles the puck more than regdit.

[01:52:33.150 --> 01:52:37.210]
And that's, in fact, on the pregame show in Pittsburgh on a sports show,

[01:52:37.210 --> 01:52:39.030]
they were talking about the fact...

[01:52:39.030 --> 01:52:44.670]
I think it was Mike Lang mentioning the fact that Barato handles the puck much better than any other goalie and league, including Hextal.

[01:52:44.770 --> 01:52:45.630]
At least that's Mike's opinion.

[01:52:46.390 --> 01:52:48.990]
And, you know, I would agree with him that he handles it very well.

[01:52:49.190 --> 01:52:53.570]
He does tend to come out and then you'll notice he shoots it up along the boards as every chance he gets.

[01:52:54.090 --> 01:52:57.010]
But at the same time, Barato is very erratic.

[01:52:57.250 --> 01:53:03.250]
I mean, regdit, whatever you can say about him, he might throw in a bad game, but he'll get hot and he'll go along with...

[01:53:03.250 --> 01:53:05.490]
There's a streak of several games and be consistent.

[01:53:05.910 --> 01:53:07.790]
Whereas Barato is unpredictable.

[01:53:08.110 --> 01:53:11.570]
He can play one great game and turn around the very next day and stick the joint out.

[01:53:11.830 --> 01:53:13.570]
See if they just keep pounding...

[01:53:13.570 --> 01:53:14.630]
Pound at home then...

[01:53:14.630 --> 01:53:16.430]
Yeah, we just have to keep shooting it at the net.

[01:53:16.590 --> 01:53:17.890]
I think we saw that in the first game.

[01:53:17.930 --> 01:53:20.330]
If you just keep throwing it toward the net, good things are going to happen.

[01:53:20.450 --> 01:53:25.050]
And the one thing that disturbed me about the team early in the season is they still didn't want to shoot the puck.

[01:53:25.190 --> 01:53:27.150]
We got guys like Need or Meyer, and of course he played...

[01:53:27.150 --> 01:53:28.390]
I thought he played well last night.

[01:53:28.390 --> 01:53:32.410]
But, and Scrutland also, Scrutland had some real good chances last night.

[01:53:32.490 --> 01:53:34.570]
He insists on trying to pass instead of shoot it.

[01:53:34.850 --> 01:53:36.750]
And then when he does shoot it, he misses by 10 feet.

[01:53:37.130 --> 01:53:40.590]
You got to shoot it close to the net and good things are going to happen for you.

[01:53:40.610 --> 01:53:45.290]
Like the one that went in off Zubov's skate and the one where Barnes got it in the goal mouth and regdit knocked it into his own net.

[01:53:45.590 --> 01:53:48.510]
You got to get it in that goal crease area or you're not going to score any goals.

[01:53:48.790 --> 01:53:50.410]
I still feel very good about this.

[01:53:50.590 --> 01:53:51.170]
I do too.

[01:53:51.610 --> 01:53:58.210]
I don't know what I'm saying.

[01:53:58.210 --> 01:53:58.990]
He's been horrendous.

[01:53:59.390 --> 01:54:00.150]
So he's beatable.

[01:54:00.670 --> 01:54:03.950]
We just got to be able to keep banging away and get some lucky shots in there.

[01:54:04.110 --> 01:54:07.430]
It's a shame that you haven't got a chance to know the players.

[01:54:07.850 --> 01:54:11.030]
This is an incredibly great bunch of people.

[01:54:11.110 --> 01:54:11.950]
I agree with you.

[01:54:12.030 --> 01:54:13.430]
So the why is in everybody I'm here?

[01:54:14.030 --> 01:54:15.290]
And even I know that you had...

[01:54:15.290 --> 01:54:16.110]
Let me ask you a question.

[01:54:16.270 --> 01:54:17.390]
How would I get to know the players?

[01:54:17.470 --> 01:54:21.930]
Well, you run out to the valet, but they park right behind where the valet is.

[01:54:22.270 --> 01:54:23.170]
Yeah, but I'm not the... wait a minute.

[01:54:23.210 --> 01:54:24.170]
I'm not the kind of guy.

[01:54:24.170 --> 01:54:27.970]
First of all, by the time I get home to plantation, it's another 40 minutes afterward.

[01:54:28.590 --> 01:54:29.990]
I get up and running and come to work.

[01:54:30.150 --> 01:54:31.710]
I'm not a jox there for him.

[01:54:31.710 --> 01:54:35.170]
I'm not the kind of guy like the Blade Runner girl that's going to hang around for an hour after the game.

[01:54:35.510 --> 01:54:37.670]
Just for the great honor of bugging some of those guys.

[01:54:37.810 --> 01:54:38.890]
Those guys play hard.

[01:54:39.230 --> 01:54:40.650]
They have a tough three hours out there.

[01:54:40.750 --> 01:54:43.130]
They got to go and have a life.

[01:54:43.250 --> 01:54:45.290]
I'm not going to stand around here and bug them after the game.

[01:54:45.530 --> 01:54:46.150]
I just...

[01:54:46.150 --> 01:54:46.810]
They're great.

[01:54:47.310 --> 01:54:47.630]
Even...

[01:54:47.630 --> 01:54:50.310]
I know that you had some differences with just screw it.

[01:54:50.330 --> 01:54:51.730]
And I know it just play you're talking about.

[01:54:52.950 --> 01:54:53.670]
Not personally.

[01:54:54.310 --> 01:54:56.510]
Personally, from everybody, it tells me he's a great guy.

[01:54:56.710 --> 01:55:01.130]
But I'm not going to sit here and lie when I see guys that stink the joint out.

[01:55:01.190 --> 01:55:01.990]
I'm going to tell you that.

[01:55:02.110 --> 01:55:03.730]
And I think that Scroodland this year was highly overrated.

[01:55:04.530 --> 01:55:07.710]
I think in the playoffs for the most parties come on very, very strong.

[01:55:07.710 --> 01:55:09.230]
In the Philly series, he was dynamite.

[01:55:09.490 --> 01:55:10.150]
He was sensational.

[01:55:10.710 --> 01:55:11.930]
Last night, I thought he was weak.

[01:55:12.050 --> 01:55:13.430]
I thought he lost a lot of face-offs.

[01:55:13.830 --> 01:55:18.270]
I thought he got another stupid penalty early in the game that was uncalled for in the offensive zone.

[01:55:18.690 --> 01:55:20.890]
And he just does a lot of things that aggravate me.

[01:55:21.310 --> 01:55:26.310]
I think his slowness is a very negative thing for us.

[01:55:26.550 --> 01:55:28.390]
Well, now they've gotten a good look at Berraas.

[01:55:28.530 --> 01:55:32.970]
And you notice with Dvorak out of the line up last night, we really missed his speed.

[01:55:33.070 --> 01:55:38.490]
He'll be back in for Friday and Boatet, that line that Doug McLean put together with Needle-Mire, Dvorak and Strachaman.

[01:55:39.050 --> 01:55:41.710]
And I don't think anybody in league can keep up with those three kids.

[01:55:41.730 --> 01:55:42.850]
Good thing you told him to do that.

[01:55:43.110 --> 01:55:43.410]
Exactly.

[01:55:43.830 --> 01:55:44.610]
Well, thanks a lot.

[01:55:44.810 --> 01:55:45.250]
Okay, pal.

[01:55:45.390 --> 01:55:46.010]
Have a great day.

[01:55:47.330 --> 01:55:49.890]
We have an open line at day, at 751WID.

[01:55:50.350 --> 01:55:54.190]
In fact, you know, the Panthers had a thing in Poppano Park the first season.

[01:55:54.470 --> 01:55:55.250]
Meet the Panthers.

[01:55:55.950 --> 01:56:00.730]
And I got the honor of going out there and introducing all the players and the coaches to the crowd there.

[01:56:01.510 --> 01:56:06.350]
And they had a thing in the dining room or in the buffet room before the race has started.

[01:56:06.930 --> 01:56:11.490]
And I went in there and I got a chance to meet Roger Nielsen, which was like talking to a brick wall.

[01:56:11.670 --> 01:56:14.350]
I mean, this guy, what can I say to you guys?

[01:56:14.350 --> 01:56:15.210]
He's got no personality.

[01:56:15.210 --> 01:56:15.990]
He's got nothing to say.

[01:56:16.110 --> 01:56:16.990]
He's got no personalities.

[01:56:17.070 --> 01:56:18.650]
Just like a dead man.

[01:56:19.230 --> 01:56:21.990]
And then I met the beasurer and I thought the beasurer was a great guy.

[01:56:22.170 --> 01:56:23.050]
And I still believe that.

[01:56:23.130 --> 01:56:29.650]
And then of course, as the time goes on, you always get somebody, you know, remember the woman I called in the day and he didn't sign an autograph for some damn thing.

[01:56:30.010 --> 01:56:31.650]
There's always going to be somebody unhappy.

[01:56:32.010 --> 01:56:32.210]
Okay.

[01:56:32.710 --> 01:56:36.010]
And there always are going to be fans who are going to bug people at the wrong time.

[01:56:36.150 --> 01:56:39.510]
But generally speaking, everything that I read is about all of these guys.

[01:56:39.670 --> 01:56:40.390]
They give their time.

[01:56:40.510 --> 01:56:41.670]
People bug them after practice.

[01:56:41.670 --> 01:56:43.010]
They take their time.

[01:56:43.130 --> 01:56:44.330]
They give autographs to their kids.

[01:56:44.650 --> 01:56:45.610]
They, you know, they smooth.

[01:56:45.770 --> 01:56:46.470]
They shake their hands.

[01:56:46.890 --> 01:56:49.610]
They've been very appreciative of the way the community is reacted to them.

[01:56:49.630 --> 01:56:51.850]
And I think that generally speaks for all of them.

[01:56:52.910 --> 01:56:55.410]
So anybody who wants to tell me that the beasurer isn't a good guy.

[01:56:55.550 --> 01:56:56.270]
I think you're full of crap.

[01:56:56.390 --> 01:56:57.410]
I think he's a great guy.

[01:56:57.650 --> 01:57:01.310]
I think that when he was thinking to join out there for a while, I was talking about that too.

[01:57:01.390 --> 01:57:03.030]
And he would be the first one to admit it to you.

[01:57:03.630 --> 01:57:06.130]
I just can't stand these guys who are nothing but chills.

[01:57:06.410 --> 01:57:10.110]
Who think that if you dare to criticize anybody on your home team, that you're a bad guy.

[01:57:10.110 --> 01:57:11.890]
What kind of sports fan is that?

[01:57:12.150 --> 01:57:13.590]
What kind of reporting is that?

[01:57:14.570 --> 01:57:16.970]
And yet there's something in my image just like with the dolphins.

[01:57:16.990 --> 01:57:20.810]
You know, I've never seen a town where if you criticize anybody on a home team,

[01:57:20.810 --> 01:57:24.870]
I mean, if JB Brown stinks the joint out and gets burned two, three times in a game,

[01:57:24.990 --> 01:57:26.990]
and you say something right away, you're a bad guy.

[01:57:27.130 --> 01:57:27.830]
I don't get that.

[01:57:28.130 --> 01:57:31.110]
I don't understand it except for the fact you're dealing with a lot of people

[01:57:31.110 --> 01:57:33.430]
many of whom aren't knowledgeable at all.

[01:57:33.670 --> 01:57:33.970]
Okay?

[01:57:34.290 --> 01:57:35.350]
In other words, they're stupid.

[01:57:35.670 --> 01:57:36.730]
What a surprise, Phil.

[01:57:37.630 --> 01:57:38.830]
Here's a four-letter deal.

[01:57:38.830 --> 01:57:38.990]
Hello.

[01:57:39.750 --> 01:57:40.370]
Hey, Neil.

[01:57:40.450 --> 01:57:40.790]
Yes, sir.

[01:57:40.870 --> 01:57:41.370]
You're an aunt.

[01:57:41.510 --> 01:57:41.950]
Yeah, okay.

[01:57:42.710 --> 01:57:43.350]
Here's Kendall.

[01:57:43.510 --> 01:57:43.830]
Hello.

[01:57:44.110 --> 01:57:44.930]
Yes, sir.

[01:57:44.990 --> 01:57:46.050]
A question on the rule.

[01:57:46.310 --> 01:57:46.470]
Yeah.

[01:57:47.270 --> 01:57:49.650]
That almost goes pitch-bridge forward, almost forward.

[01:57:49.890 --> 01:57:49.890]

[01:57:49.890 --> 01:57:51.270]
Pucks got to go all the way over to line.

[01:57:51.490 --> 01:57:52.170]
Completely over.

[01:57:52.290 --> 01:57:52.550]
Exactly.

[01:57:52.790 --> 01:57:53.270]
That's what I thought.

[01:57:53.730 --> 01:57:54.550]
In a comment here.

[01:57:54.610 --> 01:57:58.350]
You notice the nice job the Beeser did too, by the way, and getting his glove on it before he could really see

[01:57:58.350 --> 01:57:59.550]
and pulling it back out of there.

[01:57:59.690 --> 01:58:00.270]
Head of boy, John.

[01:58:00.450 --> 01:58:01.590]
He stuck it out and pulled it out.

[01:58:01.590 --> 01:58:02.150]
He pulled it out.

[01:58:02.210 --> 01:58:02.730]
He inked it out.

[01:58:03.330 --> 01:58:04.310]
All these people are upset.

[01:58:04.470 --> 01:58:05.130]
I'm happy to tell.

[01:58:05.370 --> 01:58:07.130]
I can't believe these people are destroyed.

[01:58:07.510 --> 01:58:08.190]
We went there.

[01:58:08.330 --> 01:58:10.910]
We lost three-two, and we played a little better than average.

[01:58:11.010 --> 01:58:11.150]
Right.

[01:58:11.290 --> 01:58:14.730]
We lost by one goal against the highest-growing team in league against the powerhouse.

[01:58:15.030 --> 01:58:15.830]
We were down to nothing.

[01:58:15.970 --> 01:58:16.730]
We came back nicely.

[01:58:16.910 --> 01:58:19.490]
We made it a real, interesting game up to the last few seconds.

[01:58:19.870 --> 01:58:22.610]
What the hell do these people want besides the Winnery Guide Damned Game?

[01:58:23.050 --> 01:58:25.130]
They've played their hearts out and we can wrap them.

[01:58:25.790 --> 01:58:26.510]
I'm ecstatic.

[01:58:27.170 --> 01:58:27.810]
I'm ecstatic.

[01:58:27.930 --> 01:58:29.430]
Get a split up there coming back here.

[01:58:29.530 --> 01:58:30.310]
We're pretty much healthy.

[01:58:30.490 --> 01:58:32.070]
I say, let's keep moving on.

[01:58:32.130 --> 01:58:32.650]
One more question.

[01:58:32.890 --> 01:58:35.130]
Have they sold any for the if necessary game six?

[01:58:35.290 --> 01:58:36.110]
Have they sold tickets for yet?

[01:58:36.510 --> 01:58:36.870]
Sure.

[01:58:37.850 --> 01:58:39.590]
I thought they were going to start selling them later.

[01:58:40.230 --> 01:58:40.950]
Maybe not.

[01:58:41.070 --> 01:58:41.290]
I don't know.

[01:58:41.450 --> 01:58:42.030]
I'm saying sure.

[01:58:42.150 --> 01:58:42.610]
I think so.

[01:58:43.150 --> 01:58:43.770]
Maybe not.

[01:58:44.490 --> 01:58:45.790]
Better call over there and find out.

[01:58:46.030 --> 01:58:46.390]
Okay.

[01:58:46.730 --> 01:58:47.710]
Like I said, sure.

[01:58:48.990 --> 01:58:50.690]
It is a little period tomorrow.

[01:58:51.470 --> 01:58:53.210]
Let's you know what's going on in the world tomorrow.

[01:58:53.550 --> 01:58:53.730]
Right here.

[01:58:54.410 --> 01:58:56.210]
That's what we're going to be hearing from now and tomorrow.

[01:58:56.210 --> 01:59:05.650]
Thank you.
