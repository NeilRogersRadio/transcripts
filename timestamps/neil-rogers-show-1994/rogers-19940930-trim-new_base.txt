[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720]
to the late to late in just a couple of moments that the York

[00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.000]
Hill Commissioner Gary Fethan is going to respond to the

[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.840]
fire and associate with the yesterday

[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.560]
promise with us this year.

[00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:16.780]
We have a good early last night the NHL Board of Governors

[00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:21.180]
decided to defer a decision on better or not to accept

[00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.200]
the proposal of the players association.

[00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.500]
That is the right but everyone associated with the lead

[00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.940]
especially the people up here in me want a full season and in

[00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.000]
that context the players associations offer particularly

[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.060]
seductive.

[00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:44.340]
However, we are concerned that it's not that however and that can't be

[00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:44.700]
ignored.

[00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.980]
This is a league with profound economic problems.

[00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.080]
This is not just an issue of big market and small market.

[00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.060]
That's the part of it.

[00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.860]
Most of it is not possible.

[00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.460]
Over the last four years this league has gone from a

[00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.060]
collective process to a substantial collective loss.

[00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.360]
In addition there is a concern about the willingness of the

[00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.360]
players association to negotiate the settlement.

[00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.180]
We have been 16 months of this process and obviously we are not

[00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.440]
in the position to report a deal.

[00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.400]
In addition the players association refused to meet with us for

[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.420]
five months from March and February.

[00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.720]
Of course the players association would be happy with the

[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:29.300]
status quo.

[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.400]
Over the last four years salaries have tripled.

[00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.380]
The salaries the players on the contract last year for this

[00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.460]
coming year increasing at over 60 percent.

[00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.160]
Over the last four years the clubs have paid out a dollar 14

[00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.040]
in player salaries.

[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.780]
So unless the players have prepared to negotiate the settlement

[00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.880]
simply agreeing to the no strike pledge and playing for the

[00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.020]
year will only defer the inevitable and exacerbate the

[00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.340]
problem.

[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.260]
Exacerbate this you have a result.

[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:05.540]
What we are doing.

[00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:06.720]
Yes board of governors.

[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:07.400]
What are you doing?

[00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.720]
Craphead is that we are going to reconsider the schedule to

[00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.720]
provide for an October 15 start for a full 84 game season with

[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.880]
playoff that will conclude in June.

[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.300]
Yeah.

[00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.080]
So that's why we have invited the players association back to

[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.140]
the bargaining table immediately to begin intensive negotiations

[00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:28.780]
for breaching an agreement.

[00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.420]
As a result of those efforts we hope to be in a better position

[00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:40.700]
prior to October 15th either to have a deal or to know that

[00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.960]
there is substantial good faith negotiations going on so that

[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:44.920]
a deal is possible.

[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.700]
I have called Bob Good now this morning and advised him of

[00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.620]
our intentions and I asked him to get back to me as promptly

[00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.840]
as possible so that we could begin negotiations.

[00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.880]
Again our goal is to be in a position to know better whether or

[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.480]
not to accept the no strike offer by the 15th or preferably

[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.660]
to have a deal.

[00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.660]
While I have been acting as the leading negotiator for the

[00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.580]
league I have been doing it with the advice and consent of all

[00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.880]
of the teams general manager level governors owners.

[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.140]
Many of them are here with me today and they will be free to

[00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.360]
answer questions that you may have when they go back to their

[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.340]
teams and their markets will be free to answer questions that

[00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:34.260]
you may have as well.

[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.360]
But before we open this session for questions three of the

[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.900]
people here have asked for an opportunity to speak to you and

[00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.100]
Jerry Jacobs from the Boston Bruins put all first.

[00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.520]
Thank you Jerry.

[00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.420]
And thank you for the opportunity.

[00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:50.540]
Hey Climb.

[00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:51.820]
Bob, push there.

[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:53.280]
Alright, kill it.

[00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:54.020]
Audio call.

[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:54.860]
Get right out of it.

[00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:55.180]
Kill it.

[00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.060]
Okay so there is the deal.

[00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.100]
They are not playing till the 15th.

[00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.420]
They are going to try to start the 15th play the

[00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:01.300]
full 84 games schedule.

[00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.060]
They are going to go into heavy duty negotiations.

[00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.380]
They are either going to accept the thing and negotiate while

[00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.080]
they are starting or they are not or they are right.

[00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.560]
That is it.

[00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.800]
And they are all sitting around there with a long push especially

[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.120]
my buddy Cliff Fletcher from the Toronto Maple Leafs.

[00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.000]
Whereas Bill Tury is that fat face part up there the one that got

[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.480]
Bob Essence and for the Red Wings that they are trying to dump with

[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.260]
this $1.2 million salary now.

[00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.620]
Mr. Hochschot, that can't even sign a number one draft pick.

[00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:25.160]
So there is a chance.

[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.080]
Okay, not that bad.

[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.860]
It could be a lot worse.

[00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.600]
Alright, let's go to Washchester because I know these people are

[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:30.900]
getting very, very upset with me.

[00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:31.440]
That is too bad.

[00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.740]
Hello.

[00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:33.060]
Yes.

[00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:33.540]

[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:34.080]

[00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:56.500]

[00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:56.500]

[00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:56.500]

[00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:56.500]

[00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:56.500]

[00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:56.580]
I am on.

[00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.580]

[00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:57.760]

[00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:58.380]

[00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:58.520]
I am on.

[00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.520]

[00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:59.080]
I am on.

[00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.320]
I am on.

[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.620]
I am on.

[00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:12.300]
I am on.

[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:14.480]
I am on.

[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.060]
I am on.

[00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:18.440]
I am on.

[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:18.440]

[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:18.440]

[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:18.440]

[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:18.440]

[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:18.440]

[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:18.440]

[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:18.440]

[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:29.040]
Going back to the deck.

[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:29.400]

[00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:29.460]

[00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:29.460]

[00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:29.460]

[00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:29.520]
I am on.

[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:29.520]

[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:29.520]

[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.100]
I am on.

[00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.600]
A girl is wet in the room.

[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:33.600]

[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:33.600]

[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:33.600]

[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:33.600]

[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:33.600]

[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.000]
Forget some crazy jet

[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:45.780]
Yeah, we need a marino boy can he throw and our defense kick but to we'll see the helmet flying

[00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:49.380]
Markly the crying when we stick to Buffalo

[00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:56.500]
My underwear just as long get me there

[00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:03.120]
So come on me. You'll help me get a life and send a Cuban boy up there to

[00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:09.660]
I'm Buffalo you jackass beautiful job, paly great job. You're done. Okay. We have an open-line today

[00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:13.760]
There's Dave Johnson isn't the track. He says they're down a stretch. They come and just give me the cash

[00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:18.080]
There's a guy who don't have to worry about where his next meal is coming from put on the weight on there

[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.220]
Hi Dave. I guess when he got all that money, it's not easy to stop eating

[00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:24.600]
It's a 12 minutes after one and of course like I said the

[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:28.000]
Yeah, I don't know how the audio was on the air because I was like in the middle of a see

[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.560]
I'm the eternal optimist even though people think I'm a pessimist

[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.840]
I'm optimistic even when there's no chance I figure well, you know if they're still breathing

[00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:36.660]
There's still a chance if they're still alive. Maybe I can touch him

[00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:41.220]
But you know he said the 15th they want to get the whole thing in there and he looked like he met it

[00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:44.640]
Which means he's probably lying through his teeth. He looked devious and sneaky to me

[00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:48.160]
He looks like Tom Denenberg on a bad day. I'll tell you that right now

[00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:54.980]
Here's a little brown jug from Delaware, Ohio, Roger Houston is screaming and puking and yelling and look at that hanging on by a thing

[00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:58.400]
So anyways one 13 at WIOD

[00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:07.040]
The paybone challenge news from around the planet and a lot more it's Rick and Sons weekday mornings right here

[00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:19.920]
Here at this busy manufacturer we've secretly replaced the regular coffee with the rich full-flavored taste of

[00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:23.700]
Let's listen in to see if anyone's noticed the difference

[00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:30.000]
Hey, you're the microphone

[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.840]
You can't forget to call me

[00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:40.260]
Introducing national coffee are new European flavor so good you can serve it anytime anywhere

[00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:48.360]
So the next time you want a full rich slightly pungent cup of coffee fill it to the rim with new mountain groin

[00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:50.680]
European flavor from national coffee

[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:53.680]
Personally seasoned by Juan Valdez's mule

[00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:57.440]
European flavor good to the last grip

[00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:00.920]
172 WID now you come down and they're already my guide

[00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:04.000]
You've been so hysterical in their days and miracle we'd even do a show here today

[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:09.160]
Okay, in the next 10 or minutes or so we may we might get another contender or two all the way really down

[00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:11.480]
It will just kill some time and then we'll like narrow it down

[00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:14.100]
I have our four and then we'll call them back like right at 130

[00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:18.980]
Or they're about and then we'll let you we decide to give it to and the trip to

[00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:25.700]
It's been kind of interesting watching people like Ben then gravel and suck around and make up stories and just do almost anything and

[00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:31.460]
Dehumanize themselves which I think is pretty good indication what human H is all about here's plantation on the starline. Hello

[00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:38.580]
Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. I just gotta say something that yeah people are whining there telling these horror stories

[00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:43.520]
Why they should go to Buffalo? I got something I'm mad about that. Yeah, you know what it is. What's that?

[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:46.020]
This is God everything that that Wayne touches

[00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:51.840]
Turned to crap. Yeah, turning you a big bulge of money in his pocket and turns to a big hemorrhoid in our butt

[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:54.120]
That's what it turns to I mean he's telling us

[00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:58.100]
He murdered with my account, but first they have to sell the Rangers of math square garden

[00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:03.120]
They saw this whole thing coming right. I'm mad. I don't know what I'm gonna do with all my hockey tickets

[00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:07.920]
But I'll tell you one thing. I'm not gonna buy a dolphin ticket at Joe Robby Stadium

[00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:13.020]
I thought he feds would say yeah, but I would must to go to Buffalo because I want to see the

[00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:14.060]
Dumpins for a love

[00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:17.080]
All right, have a good trip

[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:22.780]
We have an open line on the starline star I OD and let's do a crawl springs. Hello

[00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:27.980]
Yeah, Reverend through them all I want to save your life

[00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:34.480]
I want you to reach deep in your pocket and grab it and that too. Yeah, and give it here brother

[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:38.340]
Cuz I need to go up there and save my soul. Okay, grab his brother

[00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:43.660]
We have an open line if you can find it in browbroward 52494. There's that fat Chris Lincoln man

[00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:48.840]
He just makes me sick. He just he is the biggest pile of turd and remember a couple of years ago

[00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:50.540]
He was telling everybody he was losing so much weight

[00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:54.700]
I think he was wearing the lighter jacket is what was that thing he lost about two ounces and

[00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:59.440]
They got all this horse racing stuff on here now, which you know as much as I and they showed the little brown

[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:01.020]
Jug which is great, but it's old news

[00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:04.980]
It's old had they should be back on an entire press conference if they were a real sports network

[00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:09.940]
Which they are not they had that special thing they cut in there for the and as soon as the fraud from Quebec came on the

[00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:13.480]
University cut out of it. Is that thing still on by the day of November 15th?

[00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:17.440]
It's still a 20th time to go to the playoffs the only reason you gave it the time then

[00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:22.680]
Because you said you didn't want the fans to have to spend money on a season that may not come to the conclusion because of the players

[00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:26.540]
Right yesterday clearly the players removed that possibility

[00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:30.340]
Right result out of heaven seems like a country. Just stick it to them. Oh, no good

[00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:36.960]
The the fact is that we can still get in a full seat in their team maybe June

[00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:39.260]
From an 84 game regular see

[00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:42.780]
Yeah, yeah, we are trying to

[00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:48.980]
Everything possible to preserve the season because as everyone up here will tell you

[00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:55.300]
There are some profound issues that have to be dealt with and just putting them off doesn't address the problem

[00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:58.960]
You've got the result what we're going to try and do is

[00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:03.440]
Pay shut down on their offer of good faith bargaining and do it now

[00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:08.860]
And if it's too weak to ferment is the price we pay then I think it will turn very well in the process

[00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:15.180]
And it will also give us an opportunity to understand better their pledge of a no strike

[00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:19.700]
commitment in the context of good faith negotiations and

[00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:25.220]
Because obviously if we find ourselves in the same position a year from now

[00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:30.440]
Because we haven't been able to negotiate the settlement and then we have an advance the process

[00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:32.320]
Okay, kill it

[00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:37.180]
See I still say they are the ones that created this whole thing this whole nightmare and they keep out bidding and they keep

[00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:40.000]
Okay, we'll give you a three million we'll give you six million we'll give you seven million

[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.880]
And I guess what we're losing money we're pissed off. We're gonna go out of business

[00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:45.380]
Well, who the hell's fall to Zad you idiots?

[00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:49.360]
In other words, we got a bunch of guys saying they're basically pretty crappy businessmen

[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:53.300]
And they're putting the card on the head of the horse and they're so greedy and so jealous and trying to make more money

[00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:56.740]
Everybody else that they think they can do it by spending more money and when it doesn't work out

[00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:58.820]
Oh gee, we're losing money. Well tough crap

[00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:00.040]
I

[00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:04.620]
Don't see the ticket prices coming down. I saw our ticket prices go up six bucks in our seats

[00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:06.540]
Is what I saw

[00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:12.880]
My god to give you a soggy piece of cheesy crap there

[00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:16.720]
They call it a piece of pizza for it's two and a half three bucks my dog would have laughed at a man

[00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:20.120]
He wouldn't he wouldn't have taken a dump on it. That's how bad that he wouldn't gotten that close

[00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:24.160]
That's what a joke that thing was and they just keep go. Oh, you want a soda here?

[00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:29.580]
That's only four bucks for a nice small soda in a little cup with no ice or lots of ice

[00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:31.320]
He wants a extra ice here in oyster charge

[00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:36.400]
I'm serious you could pee in that cup and have room left over for the Chinese army

[00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:41.500]
That's that's the kind of stuff they give you and that's the joint. Oh, sure only eight bucks want a beer here

[00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:42.100]
Give me a 50

[00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:46.860]
Anyway, I'm getting all excited. I'm getting worked up and there's nothing I can do about it

[00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:48.940]
I'm doing the best I can I'm trying to promote good stuff

[00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:54.180]
I'm trying to like create a little excited and otherwise very dead head place and it just that's impossible because we got a bunch of

[00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:58.740]
Graver obris here that run a whole goddamn world and I'm telling you right now that monster rewinds for free

[00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:00.260]
Just don't ever forget it

[00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:03.080]
122 a W.I.o. Dean speak and even better than that

[00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:09.460]
Have you ever noticed that when you go to rent certain kinds of videos at certain kinds of stores not to mention any names or talk about popping zits

[00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:15.160]
That you just can't find the movies you really want to find that certain kinds of goody two shoe stores. Well guess what?

[00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:18.880]

You're contender?

[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:42.540]
Yes, I am.

[00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:43.640]
You don't sound like a contender.

[00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:46.040]
Well, yeah, you got to know me.

[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:47.920]
You send me to Buffalo.

Yeah, I won't shower for a week,

[00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:51.920]
but I can fit in with those two good Buffalo men.

[00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:53.780]
Yeah, I won't shave for a week,

[00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:55.800]
so I fit in with Buffalo women.

[00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:56.460]
Yeah.

[00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:59.380]
And even though you're putting this in a suite,

[00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:01.060]
I'll run up and down the aisles

[00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:02.760]

[00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:05.340]

Okay, thanks, pal.

[00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:09.040]

[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:14.960]
Okay, I think we're done.

[00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:17.020]
Right now, who we got from today?

[00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:18.460]
We were going to pick one right here on the year,

[00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:18.880]
who we got.

[00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:20.040]
How many contenders do we have?

[00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:22.320]
Stored the old circumcision guy that made up the story.

[00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:22.900]
Oh, yeah, right.

[00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:23.800]
That was a phony story.

[00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:24.460]
He was a good guy.

[00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:26.400]
A driver with the Buffalo sob story.

[00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:27.900]
The Corvette, the woman?

[00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:28.760]
The woman Diane.

[00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:30.400]
And don't pass by that all we have

[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:31.340]
too many women on here.

[00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:33.060]
See, I don't, I mean,

[00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:33.640]
I don't really care.

[00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:34.880]
Just a question of who was good.

[00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:35.960]
I was good.

[00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:35.980]

[00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:36.900]
I was in birthdays in two days.

[00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:38.660]
Yeah, and her sister's a Buffalo fan.

[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:41.300]
Oh, the one that's in New Orleans or somewhere?

[00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:41.640]
Yeah.

[00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:42.440]
Right.

[00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:44.520]
Frank, he's from Buffalo,

[00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:46.000]
but he's a converted dolphin fan,

[00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:47.300]
but his wife's a bull fan.

[00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:50.020]
Oh, he's wife's a bull fan,

[00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:50.440]
too, yeah.

[00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:50.980]
Right.

[00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:55.060]
Ron, another Corvette guy whose wife is jobless and pregnant.

[00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:57.420]
Jobless and pregnant.

[00:17:57.780 --> 00:17:58.460]
Jobless and pregnant.

[00:17:58.600 --> 00:17:59.120]
How about his wife?

[00:17:59.480 --> 00:17:59.820]
Her too.

[00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:00.220]
Okay.

[00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:02.980]
And Bob, he has an underprivileged wife

[00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:04.860]
in a 12 year old straight-ass son who you want

[00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:05.480]
to do something for.

[00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:07.040]
He wants to send them to white.

[00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:07.640]
Well, I like that.

[00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:08.240]
Well, that was good.

[00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:08.880]
Didn't you like that?

[00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:09.460]
That was right.

[00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:13.500]
So seriously, because we're doing too many of the way

[00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:14.200]
in that Corvette thing.

[00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:15.340]
See, that, that, that, that's smack.

[00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:17.400]
So favorites is in my part, which it is.

[00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:19.560]
But now I like, I like the thing with Bob

[00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:20.940]
and Leo, what's said the wife and the kid?

[00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:21.780]
Okay, we'll call Bob.

[00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:23.760]
Because he's going to be screwing around down here, United.

[00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:25.060]
I said, what was your name?

[00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:25.880]
He said the Jeanette.

[00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:28.340]
I mean, Jean, I mean, Sharon, whatever I don't.

[00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:29.720]
So I get to hang up on a bunch of people right?

[00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:31.420]
Oh, yeah, blow all these people up.

[00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:34.660]
So what we're going to do now is we'll call all those people back.

[00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:35.900]
And now why say all those people?

[00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:36.420]
They got Russell?

[00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:37.460]
Wasn't that the guy's name?

[00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:41.840]
Russell and the, the broad from the second day,

[00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:44.640]
and the guy from Plantation Acres from yesterday.

[00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:48.420]
And this douche bag, Russell Rosie Mark and Bob.

[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.260]
And thanks to everybody who lowered yourselves.

[00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:55.140]
I appreciate it.

[00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:58.180]
I know a lot of you really, you just made absolute answers

[00:18:58.180 --> 00:18:58.700]
of yourselves.

[00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:00.760]
You embarrassed people who knew you heard you on the air.

[00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:02.540]
You, you demeaned, you brawl.

[00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:03.860]
Yeah, stop calling back.

[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.600]
You grabbed some lines on it.

[00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:07.260]
It'll be that crap.

[00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:07.720]
They're not called.

[00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:09.200]
We're all done with calls for a month now.

[00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:10.740]
They're not fooling me.

[00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:11.500]
That was a fantasy.

[00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:13.060]
That was that whole thing we went through this whole week

[00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:13.800]
has been a fantasy.

[00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:15.960]
Boy, the phones were smoking this week.

[00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:17.200]
Well, of course, we're going to weigh a guy down

[00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:17.800]
in the trip to Buffalo.

[00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:18.320]
What do you expect?

[00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:18.400]

[00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:18.400]

[00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:20.720]
They have no interest in me and anything that's going on

[00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:22.820]
in my life in the show in a hockey season.

[00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:23.680]
I'll take care about it.

[00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:24.820]
Say that fat slabs, give it away.

[00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:25.540]
A free trip to Buffalo.

[00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:26.020]
Let's go.

[00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:27.280]
Let's pretend to be dolphin fans.

[00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:29.380]
Get that Chris Lankin off my screen.

[00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:32.100]
Man, this guy, he's like the Dave game of racing.

[00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:33.740]
This guy of the racing game.

[00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:34.320]
Look at that.

[00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:35.860]
Man, oh man.

[00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:37.800]
But this guy takes it when he gets on a plane.

[00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:38.900]
They just give him first place.

[00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:39.700]
I don't mean to see.

[00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:40.480]
I mean, the section.

[00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:42.380]
He's like that sales guy.

[00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:43.040]
We got downstairs.

[00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:45.360]
Oh, that guy Jeff the clown.

[00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:49.040]
Get him one of those red noses and suit his ass up.

[00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:51.300]
So what are you doing now, man?

[00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:53.100]
Is this going to take like a long time to get these people?

[00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:54.860]
And like I said, if we don't have him on the phone,

[00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:56.140]
I can next the four or five minutes.

[00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:58.900]
There history, baby, that narrow is the field right down.

[00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:02.980]
Russell and Rosie and Mark and Bob, the four final contenders.

[00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:04.240]
And I'll say it again.

[00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:06.020]
Well, I don't think continental airlines and the Radisson

[00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:07.720]
Airport Hotel in Buffalo because they're making this

[00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:10.840]
all possible round trip airfare for two via continental Miami

[00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:12.160]
to Buffalo, April 7th.

[00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:14.280]
You stay Friday and Saturday night via 7th and eight.

[00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:16.460]
I mean, I'd say April, October, whatever they're going to play,

[00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:18.840]
whatever they decide they want to play at the Radisson Airport,

[00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:21.920]
hotel in Buffalo, transportation to the game and a suite for the game

[00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:24.460]
to watch the suite events as hopefully we pray.

[00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:28.060]
We pray that Dan Moreno just picks apart that porous Buffalo

[00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:30.420]
secondary that we have a running game, which I don't know.

[00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:32.200]
I see he's starting to get the bangles on Sunday.

[00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:35.980]
Nice going, he had a boy, baby show him a finger to man and pay

[00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:38.100]
those back taxes on that restaurant to why you're at it.

[00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:38.680]
Oh, sorry, Woody.

[00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:40.240]
Okay, how are we doing?

[00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:40.840]
Who we got on there?

[00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:41.620]
We got anybody on there?

[00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:42.340]
Russell and Rosie.

[00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:43.540]
Russell and Rosie.

[00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:45.400]
Now who's the Russell's on six?

[00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:46.040]
Russell.

[00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:47.220]
How you doing?

[00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:47.760]
Pretty good.

[00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:48.740]
Russell, isn't this incredible?

[00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:50.720]
This is Russell from way back on the Tuesday.

[00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:51.300]
Right.

[00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:54.280]
And I feel like I'm at a distance advantage, but I tell you,

[00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:57.080]
well, because it's been a long time since I told my story.

[00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:57.980]
But wait a minute.

[00:20:58.100 --> 00:20:58.620]
Don't you understand?

[00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:00.920]
That's why out of fairness, because I said this.

[00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:03.300]
I said that the people on Tuesday would be very, you know,

[00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:04.560]
they would be really normal for the LAR.

[00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:06.600]
That's why we're going to bring everybody back.

[00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:09.840]
You have a final opportunity, restate there and make up some new craft

[00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:12.220]
and see who does the best job of BS in us.

[00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:13.520]
Well, there's a lot of things.

[00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:14.060]
And I said, me?

[00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:15.860]
I thought it was very fair.

[00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:18.300]
In fact, today, you better than you.

[00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:18.840]
You better get through here.

[00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:21.880]
Well, we could hear a dial tone real quick on this line, Russell.

[00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:26.180]
On Wednesday, when I heard you say my name that you had thrown out

[00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:30.660]
every contestant from Tuesday, but the day before I got to be honest with you.

[00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:33.960]
And I don't want to say anything that is going to cause you to jeopardize your

[00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:34.300]
opportunity.

[00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:34.880]

[00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:38.560]
But I really kind of figured that I was going to be the winner.

[00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:40.680]
I didn't.

[00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:42.760]
Yeah, based on what?

[00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:47.780]
Based on the fact that number one, my story is true.

[00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:50.460]
I mean, who has ever heard of Oniata University?

[00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:51.360]
I don't even know.

[00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:54.320]
I don't think, I mean, Oniata, to be honest with you, I don't think is in Buffalo.

[00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:56.620]
No, it's about, it's not anywhere near Buffalo.

[00:21:56.820 --> 00:21:57.820]
No, it's not that far.

[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.140]
It's about 80 miles, but Oniata is near Cooper's town.

[00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:01.580]
Right.

[00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:03.960]
So my, well, Cooper's to 80 miles from Buffalo.

[00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:04.940]
You're a maniac.

[00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:07.100]
Well, I think Russell's going to disqualify himself.

[00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:09.580]
Cooper's town is like hundreds of miles from Buffalo.

[00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:12.300]
I'm only going on one of my wife's that 80 miles.

[00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:14.220]
Well, why don't you guys just walk it?

[00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:14.860]
How's that?

[00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:17.260]
But Oniata is nowhere near Buffalo.

[00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:19.920]
According to her, it's not too far.

[00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:20.600]
Well, dreaming.

[00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:24.720]
George, you notice how Russell's story is starting to fall apart here already?

[00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:27.660]
Like I said, I didn't want to say anything to jeopardize.

[00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:30.820]
Boy, you talk about a guy who's blowing it, blowing the stuff right out of the water,

[00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:34.020]
even the kamikaze in the war and never did number on themselves like this Russell.

[00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:36.480]
I don't even want to tell you at your last thing to do with Russell.

[00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:38.880]
Do I want to say it on the air?

[00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:40.020]
Absolutely not.

[00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:42.760]
What is his last name have to do with this?

[00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:43.640]
Turn your mic off.

[00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:44.600]
Okay.

[00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:47.340]
Oh my God.

[00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:49.340]
That might disqualify you right there.

[00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:51.820]
Yeah, well, it's not, I mean, not like a German name to me.

[00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:52.460]
That's not my fault.

[00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:53.260]
Are you German Russell?

[00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:54.140]
No, I'm Jewish.

[00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:54.880]
You're Jewish.

[00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:56.500]
Now Russell's back in the running again.

[00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:57.680]
Absolutely.

[00:22:58.020 --> 00:22:59.280]
I'll do you not related to Gary Betman.

[00:22:59.460 --> 00:22:59.620]
Are you?

[00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:00.040]
No.

[00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:01.500]
Okay, because you'd have been out faster.

[00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:03.360]
This line would have been dead faster than a door nail.

[00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:04.220]
I'll tell you what that right now.

[00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:04.380]
You know so long.

[00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:06.140]
Do you get a new sport channel?

[00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:07.100]
Oh, yeah.

[00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:07.820]
It's on the top.

[00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:09.100]
It's still on?

[00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:09.660]
Oh, wait a minute.

[00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:10.040]
Okay.

[00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:11.420]
How come George didn't tell me this?

[00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:13.200]
He's busy near a plane with all these assholes.

[00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:17.040]
You missed about 10 minutes of back space to fill up the do-do going through.

[00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:19.480]
How about Cliff let you to Cliff say a thing or two on here?

[00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:20.280]
You know what?

[00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:25.800]
Gary, there are, it seems to be there are deeply entrenched philosophical differences.

[00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:32.360]
For example, virtually any proposal that you make is interpreted as a salary half.

[00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:35.320]
How can you possibly have a killing in there?

[00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:39.340]
Kill it, bring up Russell on here trying to win a trip and you got this little torpy

[00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:41.140]
Jew on there as screwing up our lives.

[00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:42.220]
Go ahead Russell, I'm sorry.

[00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:43.800]
Well, here's my plan.

[00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:44.400]
Oh, I'm sorry.

[00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:49.560]
If you have ever seen him and Tom Dennyberg together, this Gary Betman, I mean a match made in heaven.

[00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:51.300]
That is Tom Dennyberg.

[00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:53.080]
Have you ever seen him in the same room?

[00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:54.000]
Listen to him wine.

[00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:54.960]
Go ahead, sir.

[00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:55.760]
Russell.

[00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:58.980]
I do have an itinerary planned out for my trip.

[00:23:58.980 --> 00:23:59.480]
Yeah.

[00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:03.580]
My wife, unfortunately, I was going to try and surprise her, right?

[00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:06.860]
But she heard my name on the air when they...

[00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:07.820]
Your wife listens to the show?

[00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:08.160]
Yes.

[00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:08.980]
We love your wife.

[00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:09.420]
What's her name?

[00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:10.400]
Her name is Gail.

[00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:11.240]
Gail.

[00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:13.500]
Sounds like a glacier name to me.

[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:14.940]
Well, she converted.

[00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:15.960]
Oh.

[00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:17.640]
Is that what she was circumscribed?

[00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:19.260]
Is M.I.?

[00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:20.320]
No, I said circumscribed.

[00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:22.360]
Come on Russell, don't start getting too intellectual here.

[00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:23.020]
You're going to blow this.

[00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:23.760]
I can feel it.

[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.420]
I'm in the thing too.

[00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:26.760]
Did you see...

[00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:29.020]
You missed Philas Pizzero's explanation of...

[00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:32.220]
Listen, I'm in a very tense mood with this hockey thing today.

[00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:33.660]
I'm thank God I missed Philas Pizzero.

[00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:34.160]
I see him.

[00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:35.760]
I start upshucking for the whole weekend.

[00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:36.340]
It would be shot.

[00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:37.660]
Thank God I missed him.

[00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:38.120]
Oh, he would...

[00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:40.040]
And especially just before your call, you'd have been...

[00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:41.020]
You'd have been history already.

[00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:41.380]
I know.

[00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:42.580]
So I won't mention the...

[00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:42.780]
Good.

[00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:43.740]
Don't mention it again.

[00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:46.180]
So anyway, now your story is she's going...

[00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:47.740]
She graduated only out of college.

[00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:48.220]
Right.

[00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:49.800]
Which allegedly is a near buffalo.

[00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:50.980]
Which it is not, by the way.

[00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:52.720]
Cooper's town is not anywhere near buffalo.

[00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:55.260]
She's going back for a reunion.

[00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:58.560]
If they're homecoming reunion, they're ten years...

[00:24:58.560 --> 00:24:59.280]
And she's going on what?

[00:24:59.400 --> 00:24:59.700]
Saturday?

[00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:03.660]
The function is Saturday night from seven to midnight.

[00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:04.780]
That's their homecoming.

[00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:05.920]
It's nearly anything.

[00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:06.300]
Yeah.

[00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:07.580]
So she has...

[00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:10.660]
And you're going to be screwing around in Buffalo while she's hundreds of miles away and owning on it.

[00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:11.720]
And I'm beginning to see through this.

[00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:12.280]
This looks good.

[00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:14.720]
I wouldn't know anybody in Buffalo, but...

[00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:20.520]
She said that during Saturday, during the day, because I've always wanted to go to Cooper's town that we can go.

[00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:23.740]
And that, to me, I mean, the football game is great.

[00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:26.620]
It would be like the ultimate weekend for me personally.

[00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:30.900]
And I would get to take my wife on this trip that she has been real.

[00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:37.240]
You know, since I told her about two months ago that we couldn't go, I haven't been...

[00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:38.680]
I don't want to...

[00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:41.700]
I mean, a lot of people are listening to me, but so I have to elaborate.

[00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:44.520]
I haven't exactly been getting a lot of action.

[00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:46.000]
Thank you.

[00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:46.520]
Yeah.

[00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:47.480]
So maybe...

[00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:48.080]
Well, she converted.

[00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:48.820]
You made her Jewish.

[00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:50.440]
Now you're complaining about what thought you wanted.

[00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:53.720]
If you'd left her as a boy, you'd be getting it all the time, man.

[00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:54.560]
If I wouldn't know.

[00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:55.600]
That goes with the territory.

[00:25:56.100 --> 00:25:56.980]
If I wouldn't know.

[00:25:57.260 --> 00:25:59.160]
I think you're sticking your credit cards in the wrong place.

[00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:00.680]
Okay, listen, hang on Russell.

[00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:02.680]
Okay, your store is a little weaker today than it was, too.

[00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:04.340]
But you're in the running, definitely hang on.

[00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:04.580]
Okay.

[00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:06.160]
Okay, he's a little shaky.

[00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:08.420]
Okay, one in the Gary Bentman still on there.

[00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:09.700]
Shaking his head, speaking to Shaky.

[00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:10.520]
What's he saying here?

[00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:11.220]
Great score.

[00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:12.440]
It's a great score.

[00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:13.220]
Great role play.

[00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:13.500]

[00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:14.320]
High pass athletes.

[00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:15.840]
And I believe in the sport.

[00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:17.360]
Biggest one I've ever seen in my life.

[00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:18.840]
I've been trying a lot more things on the street.

[00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:20.560]
And I'm pretty good, but we've got to get our house in order first.

[00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:21.680]
And we've got to get our house in order.

[00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:22.800]
We're going to take a shower together.

[00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:25.780]
And then maybe we'll get a top-fimperium and drive the little confused on this.

[00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:26.420]
What a great thing.

[00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:29.140]
And I'd like to be able to do an air-stained event.

[00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:30.620]
To train with Ali's play.

[00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:31.820]
But there you have a few.

[00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:32.760]
Train with Tom's order.

[00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:34.780]
As you guys do, I've got something out of the agreement.

[00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:35.600]
You're asking them.

[00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:36.020]
They're good.

[00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:38.920]
But if they think they're going to do an incredible pencil, they geek you.

[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.120]
They're going to have a sour face.

[00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:41.760]
And you're going to get a piece of walking shirt.

[00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:43.340]
It's like a turn on a chair.

[00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:43.680]
It's like a turn on a chair.

[00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:44.540]
It's like we got there right there.

[00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:45.640]
You're looking at a turn.

[00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:47.620]
I'm not sure it would be better to make the meal.

[00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:48.940]
Yeah, Abby, keep it.

[00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:51.320]
Yeah, you stick that stick right down his throat.

[00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:52.540]
I say, get him right now.

[00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:53.820]
That Chris Chalios loose.

[00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:56.520]
I want to see Chris Chalios come rushing in from off of the side.

[00:26:56.840 --> 00:26:57.640]
Spirum in the face.

[00:26:57.740 --> 00:26:58.940]
Blood gushing in all directions.

[00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:01.080]
And he on his girlfriend say, okay, we're ready to deal.

[00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:03.240]
The games begin tomorrow.

[00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:04.460]
Hockey night in Canada.

[00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:06.000]
730 on CBC.

[00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:08.560]
Where's Bob Cole and Harry Neal and Don Chalry?

[00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:08.880]
Okay.

[00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:11.860]
Now we're talking and Ron McLean.

[00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:16.240]
138 and you're very emotionally distraught station WIOD.

[00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:20.220]
This is South Florida's news talking entertainment station.

[00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:22.020]
It's not crazy.

[00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:25.540]
There's that stick in my clean and I believe.

[00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:27.260]
I ran to WIO and Chris.

[00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:28.740]
Spirum right in the bus.

[00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:29.280]
I'm sorry.

[00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:31.060]
Okay, we got Russell on here.

[00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:31.660]
Here's Rosie.

[00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:32.940]
Hi, Neal.

[00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:33.520]
Hi, Rosie.

[00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:36.520]
Rosie was our first caller on Wednesday morning and blew the entire audience

[00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:37.280]
right out of the water.

[00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:40.160]
She destroyed the entire four hours.

[00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:42.620]
Everybody who came after we're just the fell in her wake.

[00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:43.240]
They were late.

[00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:44.080]
That's right.

[00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:44.860]
They were very late.

[00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:46.340]
Well, don't knock it.

[00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:51.720]
No, seriously, when you call the first one, I mean, what are the odds of hanging on through the entire proceeding?

[00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:52.780]
Pretty slim.

[00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:53.720]
Pretty slim.

[00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:55.520]
Unless you really made Georgia hell of a promise.

[00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:56.280]
I guess you did.

[00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:56.920]
A promise.

[00:27:57.320 --> 00:27:59.040]
I guess I make a promise I can't keep.

[00:27:59.220 --> 00:27:59.600]
Yeah, right.

[00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:00.960]
I think you already did.

[00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:02.440]
Got to see him in the other room.

[00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:03.520]
He's just spinning like in cartwheels.

[00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:04.460]
Oh.

[00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:08.700]
I wonder if he'll be doing that that weekend.

[00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:11.980]
I think the two of you may be doing it that weekend and probably this weekend.

[00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:13.320]
So what was your story, Rosie?

[00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:16.120]
Let's refresh our memories here because Russell, we already spoke to him.

[00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:17.540]
I don't know.

[00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:18.380]
Russell's a good guy.

[00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:21.480]
His story of changing a little bit since Tuesday.

[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.780]
His wife went once at McGill University in Montreal and thought she was in Buffalo.

[00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:32.480]
And now she's having a reunion at the University of Rochester, which is in O'Neal, and it's a little, you know, but he's a good guy.

[00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:33.420]
So what's your deal?

[00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:35.840]
Mine is that my second anniversary.

[00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:38.920]
And I want him the hell out of town with his best friend.

[00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:39.760]
I don't know.

[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.720]
Yeah, that's why we like Rosie so much because it's only your second anniversary.

[00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:43.600]
And she wants to get laid.

[00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:45.060]
I mean, she wants to have a good time that weekend.

[00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:46.980]
Well, she's doing a nice number for him.

[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:49.020]
Now George is laughing again from ear to ear.

[00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:49.560]
You gotta see.

[00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:51.280]
He's turned beat red in there, man.

[00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:53.260]
Now I know what this is all about.

[00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:56.620]
You know, I hate to say this for other three people, but is this even going to be a contest?

[00:28:57.020 --> 00:28:57.800]
Anyway, go ahead, Rosie.

[00:28:58.100 --> 00:28:59.440]
Oh, I want him to go to Buffalo.

[00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:00.120]
Yeah.

[00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:01.800]
Well, who's his best friend, a guy?

[00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:02.660]
Yeah, the guy.

[00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:03.900]
And how old is this guy?

[00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:05.180]
Oh, gee, I don't know.

[00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:06.100]
30.

[00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:07.060]
Oh, yeah.

[00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:07.660]
30.

[00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:10.040]
Oh, who's his best friend?

[00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:10.880]
He's my favorite.

[00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:11.320]
You want to.

[00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:12.880]
You said, you know, I'd do him.

[00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:13.980]
You have done him?

[00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:15.440]
I do, I'm if I could.

[00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:16.080]
You would?

[00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:17.220]
Well, I got an idea.

[00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:20.360]
Send your husband out there alone and then it's too huge to do it all weekend while your husband's up there.

[00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:21.560]
You don't want to go with him anyway.

[00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:22.700]
What's the trip for two?

[00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:26.560]
It sounds to me though, after just two years of marriage that the bloom is off the hook,

[00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:28.000]
they rose a little bit here, Rosie.

[00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:28.780]
Oh, right now.

[00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:29.540]
The bloom is off the Rosie.

[00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:32.060]
Well, you know, you gotta keep the spice in your life.

[00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:34.060]
You gotta keep them guessing every time.

[00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:34.280]
Yeah.

[00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:35.340]
You're dead and she.

[00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:35.820]

[00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:37.840]
Only I will know.

[00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:41.980]
Me and the other seven or eight guys or girls or whatever.

[00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:42.360]

[00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:44.220]
Oh, so you're in the women too, huh?

[00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:46.360]
Well, no, but you know, they're good.

[00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:47.200]
Well, they're good.

[00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:48.100]
Okay, I have hope to do that.

[00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:49.340]
Do you have an open altitude?

[00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:50.740]
I have a very open altitude.

[00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:53.920]
Well, you're certainly a heavy duty contender, Rosie.

[00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:55.560]
Hang on a second while we talk to the other two losers.

[00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:56.300]
I mean, the other two people.

[00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:56.780]
Hang on.

[00:29:56.940 --> 00:29:57.640]
Hang on, Rosie.

[00:29:58.140 --> 00:29:59.940]
Okay, she's on what we got Mark on four.

[00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:00.260]
Mark.

[00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:01.040]
Hello, now.

[00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:02.100]
What's going on, Mark?

[00:30:02.180 --> 00:30:02.960]
Oh, same old stuff.

[00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:04.800]
Okay, now let's refresh your from yesterday.

[00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:05.680]
I'm from yesterday.

[00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:08.400]
The guy who lives in plantation acres, you know, I remember this.

[00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:09.060]
Plantate.

[00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:10.600]
Mark's got a hell of a good shot.

[00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:12.180]
Just out of personal vengeance here.

[00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:13.440]
Plantation acres.

[00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:16.100]
I've been a dolphin fan longer than, uh,

[00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:17.700]
longer than anybody else in the line.

[00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:18.340]
I can tell you that.

[00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:18.840]
Yeah.

[00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:21.520]
I've lived through the Eric Kumaro's and the John Bosis

[00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:23.900]
and just just been tearing my kitschky that over here.

[00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:27.080]
Here's the man who remembers Joseph Gackie coming in here on W.I.O.D. on draft.

[00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:30.120]
They saying Eric Kumaro's gonna line up for the doll.

[00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:32.420]
I'm on the Ohio State.

[00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:33.600]
Yeah, Ohio State.

[00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:34.580]
I'll never forget that day.

[00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:36.020]
Like it was the second and third coming.

[00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:38.860]
The blackest, the blackest day in dolphin history.

[00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:39.380]
Almost.

[00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:45.360]
Anyway, I live over on 21st street out in the acres next to the day that Bobby Humphrey sucked up all the chocolates.

[00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:45.740]
Yes.

[00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:47.300]
Right, exactly.

[00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:50.100]
This guy lives in the acres right next to the dreaded bills fan,

[00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:51.520]
whether I'm not just discussing.

[00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:54.240]
I drove by there yesterday going home, which I do every day, by the way.

[00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:57.380]
And I notice not only they have the bill shack, which we all have seen,

[00:30:57.380 --> 00:31:01.500]
but they also have some paraphernalia out there like on their some adornments on the house

[00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:04.580]
that are like in bills, blue and red and white crap colors.

[00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:05.600]
It's pathetic.

[00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:09.220]
And if you want to put a satellite dish up or something like that,

[00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:11.220]
you got to go through 85,000 permits.

[00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:14.300]
You can't cut your melulucas down.

[00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:19.040]
You can have a down buffalo bills shack and the middle of dolphin terraces.

[00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:20.680]
Oh, crazy.

[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:21.160]
Right.

[00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:26.520]
So two years ago, I mean, we've had to go through four super voles in a row with buffalo.

[00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:30.120]
Two years ago, after they beat the fence for the championship,

[00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:33.120]
I went down there and I don't give a crap out there.

[00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:34.880]
I'll beat the crap out of this guy anyway.

[00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:41.700]
I went down there and I just felt that the guy felt it is his thing with some paint.

[00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:44.020]
By the way, I killed a squirrel in front of their house yesterday.

[00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:46.040]
Not on purpose, but I just ran over a squirrel.

[00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:47.540]
What do you do on that block anyway?

[00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:48.120]
That's not true.

[00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:48.700]
It's a shortcut.

[00:31:49.180 --> 00:31:49.460]
It is?

[00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:50.080]
Oh, yeah.

[00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:51.420]
It's my shortcut.

[00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:54.960]
Yesterday, I think it's an almond right in front of their house, this squirrel stopped.

[00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:57.200]
And I usually squirrels are smart enough.

[00:31:57.280 --> 00:31:58.200]
You don't even have to worry about it.

[00:31:58.260 --> 00:31:58.940]
They dart out of the way.

[00:31:59.000 --> 00:31:59.240]
That's right.

[00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:01.460]
And this one right in front of my, I think he committed suicide.

[00:32:01.460 --> 00:32:02.620]
It was right in front of the bills shack.

[00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:04.640]
Maybe he was carrying a couple extra nuts there.

[00:32:04.820 --> 00:32:05.280]
It could have been.

[00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:06.360]
Maybe they were Jim Kelly's.

[00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:06.940]
Okay.

[00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:07.900]
Hang on a second, Mark.

[00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:08.360]
And listen.

[00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:08.720]
Yeah.

[00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:14.560]
I'm going to bring up a six pack of razors all for Jim Kelly's shoes.

[00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:14.940]
Okay.

[00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:15.320]
Hang on.

[00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:18.160]
Oh, I think he may have just iced it there.

[00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:20.620]
So we got Russell and Rosie.

[00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:22.260]
Russell's not looking too strong at the moment.

[00:32:22.460 --> 00:32:22.540]
Okay.

[00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:25.540]
Rosie and Mark, I don't want to, no, don't get up, Russell.

[00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:26.400]
Yeah.

[00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:27.080]
Don't get upset.

[00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:28.600]
Well, I'm a little nervous.

[00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:29.020]
Hang on.

[00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:29.300]
Okay.

[00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:29.820]
What do you should be?

[00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:30.900]
Okay. Here's Bob.

[00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:31.800]
Yes, Bill.

[00:32:32.020 --> 00:32:33.200]
Bob is our man from today.

[00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:33.700]
Right.

[00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:36.920]
Now, what was your story again, Bob, even though it's still any moments ago, you know my mind.

[00:32:37.020 --> 00:32:40.980]
My right is a Broward County collective reading teacher.

[00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:42.420]
Oh, that's right, with a 12-year-old son.

[00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:42.800]
Right.

[00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:44.440]
He is straight-o's.

[00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:46.180]
He plays two sports.

[00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:49.260]
Sometimes the key is average, up.

[00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:51.560]
Yes, the study 11 30 at night.

[00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:54.880]
One term goal is to get out of middle school at straight A.

[00:32:54.980 --> 00:32:55.300]
Yeah.

[00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:56.800]
Christ possession.

[00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:57.480]
You saw him straight.

[00:32:58.060 --> 00:32:58.580]
Let me straight A.

[00:32:58.900 --> 00:32:59.600]
Go ahead.

[00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:00.340]
Just a joke, Bob.

[00:33:00.380 --> 00:33:00.920]
This is the joke.

[00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:14.380]
His Christ possession is a bluff and hat with about 20 signatures that he's collected over about a four-year period going to promotional events and bluff and signings family day in the light.

[00:33:14.380 --> 00:33:16.940]
He loves the WIOD Calgate party.

[00:33:17.620 --> 00:33:19.100]
Does he ever listen to the station?

[00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:20.200]
Well, it's good.

[00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:21.260]
He's in school.

[00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:21.660]
It's cool.

[00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:23.980]
That in the summer when we drive up more.

[00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:24.420]
Yeah.

[00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:28.620]
He listens to summary the better ones that I have.

[00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:32.620]
You know, going through driving through the Carolina, we can't get radio reception.

[00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:34.980]
So I tell you a supply of tape.

[00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:35.800]
Yeah.

[00:33:36.220 --> 00:33:40.820]
He has your calendar that you gave out of the promotion at the Calgate party.

[00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:41.340]
I don't know what the weapon is.

[00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:42.600]
Yeah.

[00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:46.240]
Do you want to know?

[00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:47.660]
No, don't talk to yourself out of it.

[00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:49.060]
No, I can only answer your questions.

[00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:51.180]
You got the inside track here, I think.

[00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:54.400]
Well, I'm proud of them and I think they should get some recognition.

[00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:55.260]
They're solid.

[00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:56.940]
I can hide working like that.

[00:33:56.940 --> 00:34:02.400]
So you're the only one who so far of all the people I talk to all this week, even though you may make you may not even have a son.

[00:34:03.060 --> 00:34:07.100]
You're the only one who, like, I feel any legitimacy to what you're saying.

[00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:13.920]
I think I like the lady from O'Neill, who once stopped in Canada, they go, I just, you know, the rest of it just doesn't smell right.

[00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:16.380]
I can do the transcripts of the great.

[00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:18.920]
No, you're not going to just, you're going to kill it.

[00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:19.420]
Hang on, Bob.

[00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:19.780]
Okay.

[00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:20.800]
Don't kill a goose.

[00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:21.580]
Hang on.

[00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:22.340]
Like killing a squirrel.

[00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:22.940]
Okay.

[00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:25.960]
So we got Russell and Rosie and Mark and Bob and I have to do the break.

[00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:27.280]
Then we'll come back and I'll decide.

[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.080]
Jordan, not what I don't know what you're laughing about you.

[00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:32.080]
I've let you decide all the contenders every day.

[00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:34.100]
I have an argue to have an all the side.

[00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:34.860]
It's my show.

[00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:36.180]
It's my contest.

[00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:37.120]
It's my giveaway.

[00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:39.860]
All the side, which I already have.

[00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:42.180]
Okay.

[00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:43.720]
And you're not going to be too happy.

[00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:44.540]
But that's too bad.

[00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:46.740]
See, my purpose of being here is not to get you laid.

[00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:51.080]
When you're married to a lovely lady like you are and if you can't get any, that's your problem, sweetheart.

[00:34:51.220 --> 00:34:52.500]
Maybe if you're on strapped, you're from the wall.

[00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:53.420]
That might help a little bit.

[00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:56.260]
But my purpose of coming in here every day is not to get you laid.

[00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:58.040]
You better read that memo again from David Ross.

[00:34:58.820 --> 00:34:59.080]
Okay.

[00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:02.960]
Because going up and down these lines with these contestants, trying to find out who's going to make Gucci, Gucci,

[00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:04.980]
that's not the idea of why we come in here.

[00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:06.940]
Although quite frankly, I would like to be able to do it.

[00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:08.860]
And none of these people are even close.

[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.060]
For these guys who are still sitting there, they got their arms.

[00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:13.240]
Look at this old coot here.

[00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:14.460]
He's an old coot this guy.

[00:35:14.940 --> 00:35:15.760]
What's the where is he from?

[00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:18.020]
He must be a Cree of Cannock.

[00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:19.160]
Oh, here's Cliff Fletcher.

[00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:19.680]
Yes.

[00:35:20.380 --> 00:35:20.880]
What do you say?

[00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:21.400]
Like three words.

[00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:22.040]
That was the end of it.

[00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:23.200]
What are these guys from Toronto, man?

[00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:24.060]
You're a short and sweet.

[00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:25.340]
Cliff Fletcher said that.

[00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:25.700]
That's it.

[00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:26.560]
Back to you, Gary.

[00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:27.240]
That was it.

[00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:29.220]
Nice going, Cliff.

[00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:30.500]
You're a hell of a guy.

[00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:32.860]
This is a sad day in my life.

[00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:33.220]
I've said it.

[00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:35.320]
If I could tell you, I can't even put the words out.

[00:35:35.420 --> 00:35:38.220]
This is tearing the inn, the innards out of my whole constitution.

[00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:42.740]
You come here, you sweat through blood and guts through all this turmoil,

[00:35:42.940 --> 00:35:47.120]
through a gut wrenching transition of a town that used to be a tropical paradise,

[00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:51.720]
into a toilet of a just horrendous twisted nightmare of a place.

[00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:56.060]
You finally get some things that are happening that seem just maybe we have an opportunity

[00:35:56.060 --> 00:35:59.520]
to turn this into like a living, even just a semblance of a living and breathing place.

[00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:00.360]
And what do they do?

[00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:04.760]
They say, bend over, drop the soap in a stickless, long instrument so far deep in there

[00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:05.900]
that your tonsils are tickling.

[00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:08.580]
And mine were moved when I was five years old and my tonsils too.

[00:36:08.660 --> 00:36:09.180]
How do you like that?

[00:36:09.580 --> 00:36:10.240]
And it still hurts.

[00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:13.720]
Yeah, thank you.

[00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:14.760]
Another drink of water, Gary.

[00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:16.280]
There's something special in there for you, baby.

[00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:18.360]
151 at WIOD.

[00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:20.440]
America's favorite neighbor invites you over neighbor.

[00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:21.200]
It's Applebee.

[00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:24.760]
Applebee's is some of the world famous riblet platter, a pound of hickory smoked rib tips,

[00:36:25.220 --> 00:36:28.880]
served up in spicy barbecue sauce with fries and coastloff for only $8.69.

[00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:30.740]
And the rest of the menu is just as good.

[00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:34.920]
Applebee's has a fantastic house to rely on or try those great Applebee's burgers like

[00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:38.540]
the double deck of quarter pound patties with two count them, two kinds of cheese.

[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:40.560]
And don't forget that pizza veggie patch.

[00:36:40.660 --> 00:36:44.120]
If you've been looking for that extra thin crust, the authentic Italian crust, this is it.

[00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:47.960]
Of all places you find it right there in Applebee's, a thin crust with artichoke carts, mushrooms,

[00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:51.480]
spinach, fresh tomatoes, all on a blend of delicious Italian cheese and you can't be

[00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:51.980]
to with a stick.

[00:36:52.540 --> 00:36:55.480]
Applebee's has something for everybody including a separate Sunday brunch menu.

[00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:59.900]
And a gathering time from three to six and 10 p.m. to closing with half our prices are not yours.
