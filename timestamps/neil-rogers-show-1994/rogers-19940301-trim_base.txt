i'll be judging you on the quick she'd be like scoring you like the olympics

[00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.480]
you know you have to give you like a five point eight for style

[00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:02.940]
a four point two for like a composure and a uh... zero for substance so far

[00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.720]
you should give me one of those frog rain five point two right exactly if i'm

[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:07.220]
real lucky

[00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:08.640]
yeah if i'm real lucky

[00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.740]
but she can't do any of that stuff either time i try to get her in the line with

[00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:12.880]
you she won't do it

[00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:14.220]
why not

[00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.400]

case she isn't listening to not sure who it is

[00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:32.700]
more your do you think

[00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.540]
see it by by he was alright

[00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.080]
just a little bit nervous and intimidated by his wife for fear that you might

[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.140]
cut him off

[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.720]
now in the past up until the last few months that expression at a different

[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:43.580]
the significance

[00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.900]
but now when you say a guy's afraid his wife or girlfriend's going to cut

[00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.020]
him off it has like a little bit different slant

[00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.340]
here's old mar hello

[00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:58.960]
like when you were a teenager

[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.180]
remember sitting on your porch and a cool summer evening

[00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.780]
popping a zit with your fingers and eating it

[00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:06.640]
well the great taste is back

[00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:07.700]

[00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:18.780]
like warm hero's

[00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.060]

and our new booker bits

[00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:22.560]
the post-past

[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:25.780]
ice cream you scream we all scream

[00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:26.660]
for plus

[00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:30.540]
eleven thirty three w on the sweden way speaking of our stupid the world is

[00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:34.160]
and especially in this country where stupidity is a very very valued commodity

[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:37.520]
in the dumber you are the more they admire you like uh... so was just alone

[00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.540]
and are the sports and they get a more illiterate you are the number you are

[00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:45.380]
and more like a bozo or like uh... rose and for example is a good example

[00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:49.420]
the uh... more money you're gonna make it more they admire and love you and

[00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:49.820]
fondly

[00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:52.800]
so last night at the hockey game

[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:56.460]
usually they have these trivia questions that really really have something

[00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:57.040]
to do with hockey

[00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:01.280]
uh... and usually the answer is either uh... roger nielson or Dennis pop

[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:04.260]
and some self-serving thing you know for the panthers

[00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:08.840]
last night's question was uh... when the uh... washington caps came into the

[00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:12.060]
league in nineteen seventy four seventy five during their inaugural season

[00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:15.920]
who was the president of the u.s. which has nothing to do with hockey of course

[00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:18.600]
but they were the visiting team

[00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:22.480]
but anyway so uh... they put up the four choices uh... let's see was linden

[00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:23.140]
johnson

[00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:25.760]
Richard nixon Gerald Ford or Jimmy Carter

[00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:31.000]
and most of the trivia questions i get right because they're pretty simple

[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.920]
like who was the uh... first goalie to wear a mask and an n.h.l. game

[00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:36.920]
if you don't always talk plant and you don't absolutely nothing

[00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:40.520]
you're like in the john moinehand class of hockey you know nothing about the game

[00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:45.040]
so i mean this one you figure okay let's see uh... nixon was impeached in august

[00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:47.500]
of seventy four left august office in that month

[00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:51.520]
and of course uh... the hockey season starts like in october november

[00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:53.900]
so

[00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:57.900]
jerald for was obviously the a president back then and i'm saying jerald for

[00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:01.620]
and even my friend big al who knows the right people but don't always know the

[00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:02.140]
right answers

[00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:06.500]
big alison i think you're wrong i think it was uh... first it's linden johnson

[00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:10.460]
of course uh... didn't run again in sixty eight which is like only seven years

[00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:11.100]
before that

[00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:12.060]
six years

[00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:14.200]
and uh... then it was jimmy Carter

[00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:16.480]
but jimmy Carter got elected in seventy six now

[00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:20.800]
but i mean these are like these are like simple questions like an our lifetime

[00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:24.260]
many of us okay and it's like uh... i don't know

[00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:28.400]
i don't know what times nancy on the night thirty p.m. eastern time

[00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:29.520]
either

[00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:35.800]
i mean it's just uh... i'm not saying that everybody's got to be a bookworm or a

[00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:40.280]
great scholar on history or whatever but i mean i'm talking about really dumb

[00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:41.540]
people man

[00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:42.660]
not you well

[00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:47.420]
but i mean just use that is an example else not the kind of guy you want to call

[00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:48.140]
dumb ever

[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:54.100]
but it's just uh... it just boggles the mind what is wrong with people and

[00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:58.380]
as how is it possible if you work that it could you possibly be so stupid

[00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:00.080]
as most of the people out there

[00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:04.320]
it's like they take a course in professional stupidity and anything that has

[00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:06.820]
any significance in the uh... history of the human race

[00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:09.180]
they don't know nothing about it nothing

[00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:14.100]
jail for course i guess that fits right in because was there anybody ever uh...

[00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:15.860]
the dumber in the congress in jr. old for

[00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:18.920]
one of the dumbest people in the history of the human race

[00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:23.640]
and also a member of the war in commission but now we're getting way off the

[00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:24.200]

after another after another they'll the hit parade lift the s off we could have tied last night

[00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:43.040]
we should have tied last night we should no we should not have tied last night we did if we

[00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:46.940]
didn't play in a team that was playing well last night it would have been ten to nothing so the

[00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:50.960]
ration was also like sleepwalk in last night and we're lucky that there was any interest at all

[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:54.840]
that's so we are better than the cap store they think that but that you know something that's not

[00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:58.820]
the point whether they stinker they don't stink the fact is you haven't been watching last

[00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:03.260]
couple of weeks since they put Sean felled in charge they've been playing very very well and if

[00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:07.020]
they would have played that way last night we could all left before the third period started you're

[00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:11.380]
right you're probably right so this business a call in this team stinks that that's going to do

[00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:15.880]
with it when you get to the big game that's not the time to come out going through a sleepwalk like

[00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:21.140]
we did last night that was embarrassing I was really prepared I was there the performance still

hey good morning Neil how are you good afternoon good afternoon when is tarda

[00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:56.260]
days listen you were talking about Joe Robbie Stadium right I had a great time last year during the

[00:25:56.260 --> 00:26:00.140]
maras season but there are a couple of things happened I left a bitter taste to my mouth really

[00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:06.440]
so I'm the one with smoking a little scope couldn't have they have the family session which I

[00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:10.340]
was not sitting in and I wasn't too sure about the rules I was sitting there smoking a cigarette

[00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:15.400]
obviously some smelly bitch went over complaining to the guy that stands there to check to make sure

[00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:21.320]
you have the right ticket he comes over and tells me I can't sit there and smoke well I got up and

[00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:26.080]
went down the stairs and went out you know in the area there and smoked my cigarette but later on

[00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:30.280]
I thought about it there was no I didn't know the rules there was no rules against me smoking

[00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:34.960]
there but because somebody complained they made me smelly bitch they made me get up in movie told

[00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:39.260]
me you know that's not to sit there and smoke yeah but I was in a section where smoking was a lot

[00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:43.680]
that must be the faggot police man if you stick one in your mouth and you burn it man your history

[00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:48.740]
better not after you in two shakes of the lambs uh thing I went to a game one night and I had my ticket

[00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:54.620]
it's about two months ahead of time I had four seats in a row a whole group of people come the most

[00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:59.320]
have been 200 people they all sat down in that section there's the guy and his whole family sitting

[00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:03.940]
in my seat so I showed him my ticket I said you're sitting in my seat he goes oh no we got the tickets

[00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:08.800]
for this section the group who has the tickets for this section so I went over and got the guy to

[00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:12.380]
take the ticket he goes well this is the whole group and it again I said what the hell are you

[00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:17.240]
talking about I these are the tickets the guy had had no seat numbers on them oh that's good

[00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:21.760]
and they were trying to convince me to move because I think I think you're being a little bit

[00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:26.060]
unrealistic okay I think there's a whole group so why should I think they're trying to sit in your

[00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:30.100]
own seats and I think that's really unrealistic well I told the guy he was full of it now it's

[00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:35.900]
my season and I did make a move yeah yeah well two of these bastards that come and sit in the wrong

[00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:40.260]
seats you're talking about fair really just like these two guys in front of us last night who I am

[00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:44.300]
positive must have been in the wrong seats the whole night including the one guy from New York who

[00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:48.420]
I just wish we get on the first bus and go back even though they were pants or fans this guy

[00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:53.420]
he's doing like a whole running commentary like during the entire first period until somebody finally

[00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:58.360]
threatened a life and limb I was I go with the buddy of mine once in a while we get the upper deck

[00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:03.620]
seats and he likes to go down on both the lower seats and on around for seats and I've done it

[00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:08.220]
with him once or twice you go and you sit in somebody's seats then they come to get in their seat

[00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:14.300]
and it's embarrassing is how but it's embarrassing you know and you know you need to move again and

[00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:19.080]
and whenever I go and do that I miss out the stinking game trying to play musical chairs it's

[00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:22.840]
no more than I'd rather sit in the upper deck you gotta understand most of our fans don't care

[00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:26.320]
about whether they see the game or not they show up about 10 minutes into the first period sometimes

[00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:29.860]
almost at the end of the first period and they leave 10 minutes before the end of the game so

[00:28:29.860 --> 00:28:33.380]
they don't care we're just there to go out and stay in the hallway and the smoke and have a

[00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:38.260]
couple of pretzels and show everybody that they're there well I'll tell you one more thing you

[00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:42.180]
tell them like yeah I have my guts ripped out there then I went to Bingo I haven't played

that once about I think maybe once or twice in my life I've seen a brother on a motorcycle

you don't see black people on motorcycles why is that huh they're less expensive than cars

they don't give me like poverty why is it that black folks for them I mean there's like a yeah I've

[00:33:54.340 --> 00:33:59.660]
