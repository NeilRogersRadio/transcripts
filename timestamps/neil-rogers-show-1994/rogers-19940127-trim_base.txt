[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:43.580]
I top the shards with grated parmesan it tastes great and the cheese helps to absorb the blood that's right nothing

tops things off like a big sweaty glob of cheese my husband likes me to you know

[00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:55.860]
but I hate the taste so I just wrap it in an individual slice of American cheese it goes down easy and that makes it easier to go down

[00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.760]

people and and people yeah yeah the same people have no life absolutely no life according to the

[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:42.120]
people yeah and the people have a life but the only thing that the life that they can do with that is like listen to Ron and Ron

[00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:30.100]
it's like going downtown there I mean they have that nice beautiful mall on it but there's nothing to do there

[00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:33.680]
there's nobody there and there's nothing to do and there's nobody to do the only thing that they have to do

[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:38.900]
years ago downtown Tampa was thriving there were all kinds of people out and there were lots of people to do and places

[00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:42.960]
to do and things but now it's like more or less you know the only thing that they got

[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:13.240]
to people who have been out of the house for a county

[00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:16.640]

[00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:09.080]
but it would be nice to get some new totalist from peaches and there's nobody else in the building

[00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:14.180]
who can do it which I guess makes her feel like a real hot shot but it would be just before we embark

[00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:18.860]
on our thing Saturday and close out the campaign since we're really trying to get close to 200,000

[00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:23.400]
it's you know what I'm saying if we said we have 195 we have 196 and we're getting really close

[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:27.220]
for like right on the edge then it's kind of like an incentive to get people to get out to

[00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:31.100]
peaches and come out to standard brands and like really a shell out some bucks and buy a whole bunch

[00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:35.820]
of our crap and help us make our goal but when I'm sitting here every day saying well we got

[00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:39.900]
and I'm giving you the same number every day it's like well it's all over forget it you know

[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:47.640]

[00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:21.080]
lines it's not expression he had and then I played the eight the tape of the eight goals that we

[00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:24.920]
scored against the Canadians on Monday that kind of shut his stupid ass up yeah I hope that guy

[00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:29.380]
remembers I'm a Boston fan I hope that guy remembers that we get spanked right out of the playoffs

[00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:34.420]
last year by the Sabres but for a straight right well we got which was the precipitant for Andy

[00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:38.820]
Moe leaving for Dallas but we have Vincent Riendo now which was a bad mistake by the way yeah what

[00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:43.140]
the hell is Vincent Riendo kind of do for the Bruins man he's a reject he's sir what is he

[00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:46.860]
going to do for him he certainly know John van Vee's broadcast the last night yeah that was

[00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:51.320]
incredible wasn't it that guy I'll tell you they had a wreck the statue of that guy they ought to

[00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:56.100]
and I have a gigantic erection right in front of the arena but now we have Riendo and I hear that

[00:11:56.100 --> 00:12:02.740]
they're the cases on the outs I hear that he's feeling pretty blue that too yeah okay good luck thanks

[00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:08.060]
you'll need it yeah we have an open line indeed well you know it it smells like somebody farted

[00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:12.640]
in here and I'm the only one who's in here and I didn't do it I farted in here well it must be

[00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:16.140]
seeping through then it must have been just a barn burner man because it's like seeping through the

[00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:21.800]
goddamn walls I'm serious right like like down where this file cabinet is it smells like a real

[00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:27.640]
musty fart musty like somebody who hasn't changed their underwear like in weeks you know who's

[00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:31.340]
wearing like bib overalls and hasn't changed their underwear in weeks and weeks and weeks and weeks

[00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:36.780]
jazz and it's like maybe it's a fart in a box maybe that's what that casket on a floor is down

[00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:43.260]
there maybe if you picked it up there would be less gigantic emotional explosion of gas maybe

[00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:47.660]
that's where jazz stores his farts because anybody who drinks as much booze cheap booze as he does

[00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:56.140]
must just cut some real rippers you know it 12 or maybe it's his wife 1234 at W.I.O.D. and W.S. UN

[00:12:56.640 --> 00:13:04.340]

Stephen Tampa fax has me somebody called yesterday he wanted to know what what the infractions can

[00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:32.680]
result in a penalty shot in the hockey game and there were a couple of them that I remembered well

[00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:36.520]
three actually and there are five believe it or not number one following a player from behind

[00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:39.520]
during a breakaway in other words a player any other team's got a breakaway he's going to go in

[00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:44.380]
alone and you're like drag him down from behind number two falling on or picking up the puck in

[00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:49.100]
the crease area number three okay accept the course for the goalie number three throwing a stick

[00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:54.300]
number four deliberately displacing the goal during a breakaway a number five deliberate illegal entry

[00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:59.940]
into the game like you know they're in the middle of you know something going on and somebody just

[00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:06.100]
jumps off gets emotional and jumps out there like Scotty Bowman so thank you Steve from Tampa also by

[00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:45.240]
open line and Broward five two four and one on the star line am I right I mean we got a lot of

[00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:50.740]

belt that the cellular one line starting on Tuesday that's a done deal it is not going to work in

[00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:47.640]
Tampa by the way but they can dial star SU went in Tampa on their GTE which I keep forgetting to

[00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:51.320]
mention because we never have any open lines over there anyway almost we're all we got off to a

[00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:57.440]
slow start today I have a feeling that they were a little down to the dumps today and I do want to

[00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:01.120]
say because I try to be fair I'm not going to come out say oh boy look at this you guy you know you

[00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:04.800]
did your best job and you couldn't win the game although I think I did say that but not quite

[00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:10.140]
vindictively but I mean they played a hell of a game man they bottled us up they outshot us they

[00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:14.160]
outplayed us they kicked us into the ground and we still got to tie thanks to the beasur and our great

[00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:18.220]
penalty killing skills which we will we're going to the game last day we're all the way up to number

[00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:23.440]
eight in the league in penalty killing which is great and we ought to be because we sure had

[00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:27.900]
enough experience especially early early in the season almost every game we had like two or three

[00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:33.540]
times we were too many short and usually killed those off so anyway but I'm you know I try to be

[00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:37.640]
objective and the lightning have really come along you're improving dramatically poopa is just

[00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:42.340]
outstanding and he also even though he didn't stop as many shots he made some phenomenal saves last

[00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:46.640]
night but they're a little disappointed because they you know they had 20,000 people under again

[00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:50.520]
they're all enthused they're all worked up this is like their last chance to kick our ass and get

[00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:55.520]
a you know a win and they threw everything they had but the chicken sink and the octopi on the ice

[00:18:55.520 --> 00:19:01.080]
and they couldn't do it so I understand here's a mobile on alligator rally hello yeah Neil

[00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:08.620]
yeah first time caller all right let's see all the time come across the alley yeah I'm always going

[00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:13.320]
back and forth from Marco Island to Palo Alto and go to show a lot watch out for that panther crossing

[00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:17.520]
over there yeah well you know what I gotta say you've done a great job with the hockey down here it's

[00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:22.900]
really I mean I grew up on basketball but I'm really trying to become a fan and last night I was

[00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:28.840]
going back forth with the Miami Heat to the hockey game yeah I thought I kind of interesting

[00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:34.620]
though the basketball game the last two minutes 25 minutes yeah that's why when you're watching

[00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:39.380]
NBA game especially during a regular season it's not even worth watching the first you know the last

[00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:43.940]
two three minutes is all you need to watch because either it's a blowout by then which means it was a

[00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:47.360]
boring game or if it's going to be exciting it all happens in the last two or three minutes what

[00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:54.180]
takes about a half an hour to play yeah it was amazing I really thought the the heat they I don't

[00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:58.820]
know the house problems right now yeah you can say that again are you guys really support

[00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:02.900]
basketball down to that much I don't really hear much about the heat is there a big following down

[00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:06.240]
there yeah they've been selling out just about every game although this year they're starting to lose

[00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:09.900]
a little bit of the natives are getting a little restless but yeah they they've sold out every

[00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:14.580]
game for as long as they've been here okay this is what I say you're going to Marco Island I'm

[00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:19.960]
going to say hey um this is a joy show and I just see all time and good luck and great job see

[00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:26.300]
okay okay I'm going over there and saying hey good guy but where is he we have an open line it's

[00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:31.400]
on a blue line 5249463 right on a blue line right between the two blue lines what was that

[00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:36.340]
expression that asshole from Sarasota used there oh man did that guy I very rarely do I let it

[00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:40.340]
call even linger in my mind around my fingers for more than like a couple of minutes but he was

[00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:46.120]
just so typical of the sour pie that is down here sour pus pusseye whatever it is but just so

[00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:52.700]
god damn many of men it's just so crotchety and crotchety and sour about everything man

[00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:57.680]
call dr jack up and Detroit and see if he can't come down to put that guy out of his misery and

[00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:03.960]
once he does that that'll help the rest of us too a lot here's boca speaking of misery hello

[00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:59.460]
the cellular one line then we'll have 11 lines and then we can say we have 32 open lines in

[00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:05.140]
day 75 and Broward 27 on the green lines four mobile lines and by the time we get done tell how many

[00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:11.740]
lines are open it shall be over which sounds like a hell of a good scam to me 11 40 11 central time

[00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:15.220]
and 1248 Eastern time at W I O D and W S U N

[00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:23.540]
bye now I think it was just a false alarm oh in fact maybe that aroma that was coming out

[00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:27.720]
here before maybe that was like a signal of things to come so to speak maybe that was like a

[00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:32.240]
four-bearer of evil uh commotings we have an open line it's on a star line if you have

[00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:36.420]
Bell Soffiability star I O D and let's do North Tampa on a date line

[00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:46.500]
yes oh my god how you been okay hockey intensive yes

[00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:52.380]

constipation, an immediate trip to the pizza loft is in order. It's better than X-Lax. It's

[00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:36.320]
So, let's begin the time let's begin the time of the pub'sowski Yu Huron Chuk to sell out into a pub called headstape

[00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:37.880]
He likes to smoke a mask.

[00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:39.060]
He's a fucking stomp.

[00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:41.160]
He's a groovy ass.

[00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:43.140]
He's a fucking stomp.

[00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:44.540]
The fuck stomp.

[00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:45.220]

[00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:45.820]
The fuck.

[00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:48.800]
Smokes.

[00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:49.480]
Go.

[00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:50.340]
Touch that shot.

[00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:50.960]
Yeah!

[00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:54.140]
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

[00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:55.700]
Thanks to the tape, Jason.

[00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:56.240]
Nice job.

[00:28:56.660 --> 00:28:57.500]
You still work here.

[00:28:57.600 --> 00:28:58.480]
It's not a weekend for me.

[00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:00.000]
Go, go, go, go, go.

[00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:01.400]
And if you put a nose ring, any more

[00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:02.480]
here for another six months.

[00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:04.640]
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

[00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:06.140]
It's one away to WI.

[00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:07.200]
That's a very big effect.

[00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:09.320]
No, his ring is a start, but then there are like certain

[00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:10.620]
other things that jazz has in mind.

[00:29:10.660 --> 00:29:11.700]
He'll show you where you put him.

[00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:13.260]
That's in now.

[00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:14.620]
Body piercing is where it's at.

[00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:16.420]
Somebody was telling me just yesterday that last,

[00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:18.960]
the eighties was the decade of ear piercing

[00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:21.400]
and the nineties are the decade of body piercing.

[00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:23.500]
Yeah.

[00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:27.680]
So all you gophers out there, try to find a hole in one

[00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:31.660]
and stick it where the moon don't shine.

[00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:34.160]
They have the earrings like in Europe,

[00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:35.740]
or a puppet, you know, like not in the puppet.

[00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:38.600]
Although that's acceptable too, but like next to it.

[00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:40.440]
And of course, if you have lots of forest gear,

[00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:41.880]
I mean, the possibilities are endless.

[00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:42.880]
It's called a Prince Albert.

[00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:45.420]
I thought that's something you smoked.

[00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:47.260]
Like I said, I thought it's something

[00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:48.360]
you stuck in your peace pipe.

[00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:51.800]
We have an open line on the star line at star IOD

[00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:53.940]
and two and a broward, five, two, four,

[00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:56.020]
whatever the rest is.

[00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:57.480]
Here's Homo, Sasa.

[00:29:57.480 --> 00:29:57.840]
Hello.

[00:29:58.600 --> 00:29:59.800]
Hello, hello, you, Neil.

[00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:00.500]
Okay, sir.

[00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:01.700]
Yeah.

[00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:03.920]
Hey, we got something going on up here in Fitchers County.

[00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:04.720]
What's that?

[00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:07.000]
The opening of the Ted Williams baseball museum.

[00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:07.920]
Oh, wow.

[00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:10.080]
I was Ted gonna stand in the parking lot

[00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:11.720]
and shoot pigeons on opening day.

[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.200]
He was thinking about it, but he's got a lot of experience

[00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:15.320]
doing that in Fenway Park.

[00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:16.420]
That's what he did the best.

[00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:18.740]
He's got, let's see.

[00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:21.480]
Mahamma Ali and George Matio are gonna be there.

[00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:22.780]
Are we chipping over each other?

[00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:24.060]
Yeah, what's Mahamma gonna do?

[00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:25.460]
They're gonna bring him around and steer him

[00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:25.920]
in the right direction.

[00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:28.500]
Yeah, so he's gonna go like that.

[00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:30.800]
Mickey Manel, Pee Wee Reese.

[00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:31.400]
Wow.

[00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:32.640]
Yeah.

[00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:33.860]
You're the mind's favorite.

[00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:37.520]
Yeah, he came broadcasting live.

[00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:39.120]
What the hell is he gonna be doing there?

[00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:41.180]
No, sucking around no doubt.

[00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:43.300]
And let's see.

[00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:44.440]
Don't be 50 dollars.

[00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:44.960]
Yeah.

[00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:47.200]
Hey, from the, uh,

[00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:48.560]
what would I think from that?

[00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:49.500]
Where is this gonna be?

[00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:52.480]
That's the town is both Sitchers Hills.

[00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:53.260]
Yeah.

[00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:55.300]
A couple of miles from right now.

[00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:57.940]
Well, this should be just tremendous draw.

[00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:02.380]
That's the, it's a two or three hundred people ear in there.

[00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:04.500]
Oh, I tell you what, a dollar a piece too.

[00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:04.920]
Uh-huh.

[00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:06.220]
They're really gonna be raking it in.

[00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:10.320]
And, uh, hey, from the, there's never a short thing file.

[00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:10.980]
Yeah.

[00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:13.800]
Uh, I was at the OBS, uh,

[00:31:14.420 --> 00:31:16.000]
you know, Cala, Cala B or sale.

[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:16.900]
They have a Samo cast.

[00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:17.560]
Yeah.

[00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:19.780]
One day somebody dumped a hundred thousand dollars

[00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:21.600]
on a horse to show this happened yesterday.

[00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:23.420]
Yeah, I was looking at it.

[00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:24.940]
I was figuring if they had to go to the game

[00:31:24.940 --> 00:31:26.260]
because the guy must have lost his head.

[00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:27.760]
Yeah, he lost on the grand.

[00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:29.380]
It was this is he's been doing this lately.

[00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:30.980]
And I don't know whether he's been cashed in that, but he,

[00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:32.920]
but this they call him the bridge jumpers.

[00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:34.160]
This usually goes on in New York.

[00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:35.200]
So must be in New York.

[00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:37.860]
Uh, but evidently, he bet a hundred thousand to show.

[00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:40.720]
Where's my chart from the track on a horse that was like a two to five

[00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:41.940]
supposedly mortal lock.

[00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:42.360]
Yeah.

[00:31:42.420 --> 00:31:46.540]
The horse is called a pago fire in the eighth race.

[00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:50.380]
And she went off at two to five and finished six.

[00:31:50.540 --> 00:31:52.460]
I mean, puked in the straight sixth by six lines.

[00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:54.660]
And he put a hundred grand into pool to show.

[00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:59.380]
So as a result, the horse that won paid $41 to win 1180 to place

[00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:05.760]
and $41 to show the second place horse paid five 40 to place 2160 to show.

[00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:10.820]
And the horse that finished third paid 86 dollars to show box car show

[00:32:10.820 --> 00:32:13.840]
prices because all the money in the show pool, including that hundred grand,

[00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:15.840]
uh, was out of the bridge jumpers pocket.

[00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:16.580]
Most of it.

[00:32:16.620 --> 00:32:17.980]
And it went to everybody else.

[00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:20.560]
How's how many was going to do that when I when I bet on the other horses?

[00:32:21.380 --> 00:32:22.100]
Exactly right.

[00:32:23.540 --> 00:32:25.160]
From the, uh, what kind of mean?

[00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:28.420]
The so if he wins, the most he's going to win is five grand.

[00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:31.780]
Now, let me ask you, do you think it's a good investment to put up a hundred

[00:32:31.780 --> 00:32:33.920]
grand to make five thousand dollars?

[00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:35.060]
If you got to lose everything.

[00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:36.040]
No.

[00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:38.960]
If there's any chance that you're going to lose it, I mean, I could understand

[00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:41.940]
if you're going to put up a hundred grand and maybe make your 20, 30, 40 grand

[00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:44.920]
in two minutes or a minute, but not to make five grand.

[00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:46.580]
You got to be a mental case.

[00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:47.240]
That raises.

[00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:48.900]
Well, have a great day, Pallie.

[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.080]
And say hi to Ted.

[00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:50.760]
Later later.

[00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:51.100]
Okay.

[00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:52.660]
See if he's still got that good aim.

[00:32:52.940 --> 00:32:56.080]
Yeah, that's Ted Williams, man, a like Revierman Boston and in revier.

[00:32:56.420 --> 00:32:57.520]
And he was a great player.

[00:32:57.520 --> 00:32:59.400]
But man, what an obnoxious asshole.

[00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:02.500]
And of course, he used to spend his spirit time like out in further out in the

[00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:06.880]
parking lot at Fenway Park, shooting pigeons, which is why they liked him so much, I

[00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:10.040]
guess 12 minutes after one at W I O D in WS U N.

[00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:13.820]
Want to tell you about my good friends, Chef Gigi Romano and his wife, Carolyn

[00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:15.140]
Romano at La Tevernetta.

[00:33:15.220 --> 00:33:19.280]
They've been with me for years and years and years and always excited to talk

[00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:21.980]
about La Tevernetta because you'll never be disappointed.

[00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:22.740]
There's some restaurants.

[00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:23.860]
You know, some days they're good.

[00:33:24.060 --> 00:33:26.320]
Some days and that's a great La Tevernetta.

[00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:28.680]
Chef Romano is in a kitchen every minute that they're open.

[00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:31.620]
And that's why when they go to Italy in the summertime, they actually close

[00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:35.480]
up for a couple of weeks so that nobody gets disappointed with anything less

[00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:36.220]
than the very best.

[00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:39.240]
And when they come back to get all kinds of great new recipes, they got your chicken

[00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:42.960]
my parmesan and chicken central pay and all out Tevernetta, which is a

[00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:46.500]
boneless breast of chicken and a fragrant wine sauce with mushrooms and artichoke

[00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:49.720]
carts and pomegranate and chicken cacciatori and all kinds of chicken and

[00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:52.780]
veal and pasta dishes, the likes of which you've probably never had in your

[00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:55.400]
life. And great, if you're in the seafood, they've got some of the best

[00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:58.480]
of that in seafood dishes you've ever had and delicious homemade soups that

[00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:01.660]
are so thick you can eat them with your elbow and the list goes just on and on.

[00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:02.700]
And they give you tons of food.

[00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:03.440]
So take your time.

[00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:04.980]
This isn't like a 30 minute deal.

[00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:08.080]
Go in there and take plenty of time to give you impeccable service and spread

[00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:11.820]
the deal out and save some room for one of those great desserts like the tiramisu

[00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:15.300]
or those great fresh strawberries from their dessert cart La Tevernetta.

[00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:16.820]
No matter where you are, it's well worth the trip.

[00:34:16.820 --> 00:34:18.900]
They've been doing it right in time or act for over 10 years.

[00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:19.820]
They're at 84.

[00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:23.660]
All the boys have stayed there and she's the one who always said that Michael

[00:34:23.660 --> 00:34:27.100]
excuse my expression, but he's a faggot and she would say that damn faggot.

[00:34:27.240 --> 00:34:27.720]
I can't stand.

[00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:35.000]
Coming next year, the King of God,

[00:34:35.180 --> 00:34:40.160]
furniture your hometown, touring to benefit the Cardinal Classy School for

[00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:41.100]
wayward boys.

[00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:42.520]
It's Michael.

[00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:43.700]
Oh, Jackson.

[00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:45.440]
My lady, the picky.

[00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:48.340]
I've got a very happy side.

[00:34:48.900 --> 00:34:49.920]
Michael, Jackson.

[00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:54.500]
So anytime that don't matter if he's back.

[00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:55.080]

[00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:55.380]
right.

[00:34:55.780 --> 00:34:58.560]
Oh, I like male children.

[00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:06.620]
They are the ones who turn me on and I hope they're willing.

[00:35:06.620 --> 00:35:11.280]
And it's a choice of making.

[00:35:13.140 --> 00:35:17.860]
I might screw up their lives, but it's true.

[00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:22.240]
They make the greatest name when they just find.

[00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:26.900]
Here are other great Michael Jackson classics like Billy's James.

[00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:28.240]
Do you know how to tell time?

[00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:29.880]
And of course, smooth criminal.

[00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:33.720]
Yes, it's Michael Jackson's tour to benefit the Cardinal Classy School for

[00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:34.380]
wayward boys.

[00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:35.300]
Get your tickets now.

[00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:38.520]
Boys under 10 admitted free when a copy by no one.

[00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:39.360]
They're white.

[00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:41.120]
They're really really tight.

[00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:42.440]
Yeah, they're black.

[00:35:42.660 --> 00:35:43.400]
They're white.

[00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:45.080]
They're really really tight.

[00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:47.300]
Oh, 1602 Alton Road.

[00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:48.040]
Sweet 111.

[00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:49.720]
Is that these studios of Latin MTV?

[00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:50.480]
Is that where it's at?

[00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:53.820]
Because that would be like right around Lincoln Road Mall and Alton Road, right?

[00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:56.280]
That must be it because that's the address they got that.

[00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:59.160]
Eros Smith concert tour contest that they got going.

[00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:02.620]
Like I told you, they're coming here February 2, which is next, what?

[00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:03.180]

[00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:07.820]
They're going to be off to all over Mexico and play this area's not over Latin America,

[00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:11.080]
which I didn't know until we found out on MTV Latino, which were the only ones who watch

[00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:11.360]
it.

[00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:15.500]
Speaking of Eros Smith, by the way, I have some bad news for my Luis Miguel fans today.

[00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:18.160]
What are two days off every now and it isn't going to hurt right?

[00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:19.880]
Will it hurt you will?

[00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:26.300]
Oh, I thought I might play that at the end of the day.

[00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:28.440]
I'm like obsessed with that Alton.

[00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:30.000]
Get a grip and the Alton too.

[00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:30.920]
Just obsessed.

[00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:33.080]
I mean, the Bee Gees album is great, which I bought the other day.

[00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:34.340]
But get a grip.

[00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:36.260]
Maybe the best thing that Eros Smith has ever done.

[00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:39.520]
That could be getting a little bit carried away, but it is out freaking standing.

[00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:44.540]
And Adam, of course, being the Ojón provocateur, says the best cut on the album is, um, eat

[00:36:44.540 --> 00:36:48.000]
the rich, which is the one we can't play on here unless jazz can play because it says

[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:49.440]
shot over and over and over again.

[00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:50.960]
Here's for a lottery.

[00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:51.560]
Hell, hello.

[00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:52.400]
Neil.

[00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:52.900]
Yes, sir.

[00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:54.840]
Um, the Bee Gees.

[00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:55.140]
Jazz?

[00:36:55.340 --> 00:36:57.280]
They were born in the Isle of Man.

[00:36:58.920 --> 00:36:59.920]
Douglas Isle of Man.

[00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:01.820]
Douglas Isle of Man, that's England, man.

[00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:02.140]
Yes.

[00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:03.340]
I thought they were from Australia.

[00:37:03.700 --> 00:37:08.520]
No, they, um, then they moved to the greater Manchester area.

[00:37:09.220 --> 00:37:14.240]
And then, um, then they immigrated just a little bit after Andy was born.

[00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:15.660]
Well, I'll be dang.

[00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:16.060]
I know.

[00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:18.080]
Where did they get to the Australian bit from?

[00:37:18.140 --> 00:37:19.540]
Well, because they immigrated to Australia.

[00:37:20.260 --> 00:37:20.500]
Oh.

[00:37:20.860 --> 00:37:28.360]
And, uh, no, the Bee Gees name, yeah, comes from, um, they met the guy.

[00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:32.980]
He was a race track promoter called Bill Good, who, uh, I thought I came from Barry,

[00:37:33.140 --> 00:37:33.880]
uh, Gibb.

[00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:36.440]
No, people often think it's brother's Gibb.

[00:37:36.460 --> 00:37:36.900]
Yeah.

[00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:39.760]
And, uh, but they met this guy called Bill Good.

[00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:40.500]
Yeah.

[00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:47.500]
He introduced them to a DJ in, uh, Australia, who worked for 4KQ, uh, Australian man.

[00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:48.020]
I bet you're point.

[00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:50.040]
And his name was Bill Gates.

[00:37:50.660 --> 00:37:53.860]
And so when it is, he used to play, um, well, was Bill Good?

[00:37:54.860 --> 00:37:56.780]
Well, I guess only Barry would know that, yeah.

[00:37:56.780 --> 00:38:00.340]
And, uh, that's how they got the name Bee Gees.

[00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:05.100]
It was Bill Good who put the two initials together of, uh, DJs.

[00:38:05.140 --> 00:38:05.220]
Yeah.

[00:38:06.380 --> 00:38:06.720]
Amazing.

[00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:08.240]
Well, there we got it.

[00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:08.660]
Yep.

[00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:09.700]
Have you been over to their pad?

[00:38:10.340 --> 00:38:10.600]
No.

[00:38:10.980 --> 00:38:13.120]
Well, now you can go because I don't know where the hell it is.

[00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:14.540]
Well, we just got the word today.

[00:38:14.680 --> 00:38:18.180]
Barry's got his own place over there on, um, weren't you say it was?

[00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:19.160]
I don't know.

[00:38:19.180 --> 00:38:19.900]
I'm confused now.

[00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:23.760]
And, uh, the other two brothers who got their other place like over on, uh, Alton Road

[00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:25.460]
and 50th or something like that on Bay Road.

[00:38:25.540 --> 00:38:26.600]
He said Bay Road in the 70th.

[00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:26.980]
I don't know.

[00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:27.520]
They're over there.

[00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:28.400]
They're a great group.

[00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:29.500]
They are great.

[00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:32.940]
I saw them in the 70s, two concerts that went to the Fantastic.

[00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:33.860]
They are great.

[00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:38.320]
And see, they got, they got lumped in with all that fat we went through about Disco's

[00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:38.420]
sucks.

[00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:40.580]
And so right away it became very, very much out.

[00:38:40.820 --> 00:38:43.480]
You know, they were absolutely out the Bee Gees, totally a passe.

[00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:47.920]
And then all of a sudden now that Disco is making a comeback and it's okay to like Disco,

[00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:50.840]
now the Bee Gees are picking up right where they left off and they're in again.

[00:38:50.980 --> 00:38:51.620]
They're bigger than ever.

[00:38:51.780 --> 00:38:54.740]
Yeah, because they, they've written some fantastic songs.

[00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:55.120]
Right.

[00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:58.160]
Is it some great stuff on that album called One?

[00:38:59.140 --> 00:38:59.720]
Yeah, they're there.

[00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:00.280]
No.

[00:39:00.620 --> 00:39:01.560]
That's really good.

[00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:02.900]
Some great tracks on that.

[00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:03.360]
Okay.

[00:39:03.820 --> 00:39:04.380]
All right.

[00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:05.480]
Well, thanks a pile.

[00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:05.900]
Okay.

[00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:06.500]
You got it.

[00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:07.260]
See how to the Queen.

[00:39:07.460 --> 00:39:07.780]
Okay.

[00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:08.320]
Tell me, hold.

[00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:09.840]
Can you help Alton Road boy father?

[00:39:10.780 --> 00:39:11.440]
See ya.

[00:39:12.140 --> 00:39:14.300]
Can you help Alton Road boy father?

[00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:15.000]
I bet he can.

[00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:15.820]
Father road tour.

[00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:16.380]
Yeah.

[00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:17.600]
Beautiful line there.

[00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:19.280]
Just got to slip that baby in there.

[00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:20.100]
Excellent pal.

[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:24.320]
We have two open lines in Broward and one on the Starline and Star IOD.

[00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:26.980]
It's 123 at WIOD and WSUN.

[00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:30.200]
You know, Carthept is a grown problem and it's getting bigger by the minute and the

[00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:31.200]
Carthept problem too.

[00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:35.640]
In fact, in 1992 in Dave Broward and Palm Beach counties, there were more than six

[00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:36.820]
Carthept's in hour.

[00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:40.460]
That's an average of about 150 stolen cars a day from South Florida.

[00:39:40.780 --> 00:39:41.520]
What can you do about it?

[00:39:41.620 --> 00:39:42.400]
Do the smart thing.

[00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:47.200]
Get yourself low jack that one of a kind stolen vehicle recovery device that they bury

[00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:48.240]
in the balls of your car.

[00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:51.600]
Just that tiny little transmitter that nobody sees, nobody knows it's there except you

[00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:52.460]
and the police.

[00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:56.960]
And if your car is ever stolen any time morning, noon or night, all you do is make a routine

[00:39:56.960 --> 00:40:01.300]
theft report to the police to activate your unit and immediately that low jack tracking

[00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:05.520]
device in your car emits that silent but very deadly and accurate home and signal that's

[00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:07.000]
tracked in on by the police computers.

[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:10.600]
They get your car back in one piece while it's still worth getting back in the pronto

[00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:11.920]
usually in less than two hours.

[00:40:12.180 --> 00:40:13.860]
And now here's the special offer that they're making.

[00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:17.600]

[00:40:49.220 --> 00:40:53.380]
What 31-1-1-1-D and I guess where I've got to play the hero Smith, I'll play whatever

[00:40:53.380 --> 00:40:56.920]
now I want at the end of the show and if anybody has likely to kiss my fat ass, okay?

[00:40:57.360 --> 00:40:58.460]
You have the way sir rest, okay?

[00:40:58.580 --> 00:41:00.820]
He's been working overtime and he's getting worn out.

[00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:02.880]
Even that young thing gets worn out after a while.

[00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:07.500]
Even he needs a rest every now and then, you know, just to put it away and rest it for

[00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:07.880]
a few minutes.

[00:41:08.540 --> 00:41:09.640]
Here's a Port Saint Loosely.

[00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:10.000]
Hello.

[00:41:10.860 --> 00:41:11.480]
Hi, Neum.

[00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:11.900]
Yes, sir.

[00:41:12.260 --> 00:41:14.000]
There are a couple things I wanted to share with you.

[00:41:14.180 --> 00:41:14.340]
Please.

[00:41:14.980 --> 00:41:16.900]
I don't know if you looked in the paper today.

[00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:18.340]
Have you ever read Art Buckwell?

[00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:19.660]
Not if I can help it.

[00:41:19.820 --> 00:41:20.460]
Well, you know us.

[00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:23.860]
No, I'd like Art Buckwell, but just when I see him on those TV shows and I realize that

[00:41:23.860 --> 00:41:29.480]
he can't speak, I feel uncomfortable watching him because he just can't move his mouth.

[00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:31.560]
There's just some lack of something there.

[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:33.440]
You've ever seen him in person?

[00:41:33.660 --> 00:41:34.300]
I mean, like on TV?

[00:41:34.940 --> 00:41:35.340]
I've seen him on TV.

[00:41:36.900 --> 00:41:37.740]
He just can't speak.

[00:41:37.940 --> 00:41:39.720]
He's a funny guy to read, but he can't speak.

[00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:44.100]
Well, the headline for his article today was LaRena Bob at Precision General.

[00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:44.680]
Beauty.

[00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:46.000]
I thought that was going to be interesting.

[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:47.260]
She could sniff it.

[00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:49.440]
There were a couple other things.

[00:41:49.820 --> 00:41:51.420]
One of them is about the circumcision.

[00:41:51.780 --> 00:41:51.940]
Yes.

[00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:58.860]
I personally experienced that and I had it, I was born and didn't have the circumcision,

[00:41:59.040 --> 00:41:59.160]
right?

[00:41:59.560 --> 00:41:59.700]
Yeah.

[00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:02.800]
So when I was 49, I had to have...

[00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:03.100]
49.

[00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:03.980]
Yeah.

[00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:06.840]
Because the skin had lost its tensile.

[00:42:08.060 --> 00:42:08.720]
Its tensile?

[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:09.000]

[00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:11.780]
So you could put it on a Christmas tree anymore, right?

[00:42:11.980 --> 00:42:12.440]
That's right.

[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:15.080]
And so I had to have the circumcision.

[00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:16.500]
What did you mean the skin had...

[00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:17.500]
I don't want to get too graphic.

[00:42:17.660 --> 00:42:18.140]
What does that mean?

[00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:19.180]
Lost its tensile.

[00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:21.340]
Well, it lost its flexibility.

[00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:22.380]
Elasticity.

[00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:23.520]
Elasticity.

[00:42:23.620 --> 00:42:24.140]
Ooh, man.

[00:42:24.300 --> 00:42:24.940]
That's a better word.

[00:42:25.220 --> 00:42:26.140]
Oh, it was like a brick.

[00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:29.480]
Well, it was painful, you know.

[00:42:29.740 --> 00:42:29.920]
Wow.

[00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:30.940]
When it was swell up like that.

[00:42:31.020 --> 00:42:31.260]
Wow.

[00:42:32.380 --> 00:42:34.540]
So anyway, I had to have the circumcision.

[00:42:34.940 --> 00:42:35.100]
Yeah.

[00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:39.020]
But the first few years, I really didn't notice anything different.

[00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:44.760]
But as time went by, like, 10 years later, it really loses its sensitivity.

[00:42:45.580 --> 00:42:46.680]
And I think that was...

[00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:48.660]
Well, maybe it might have been the fact that it was 10 years later.

[00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:49.800]
That might have had something to do with it.

[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:50.400]
Oh, sure.

[00:42:50.540 --> 00:42:52.000]
Well, it's a gradual process.

[00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:52.240]
Yeah.

[00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:56.560]
But I think that was on there through a natural selection for some reason.

[00:42:57.500 --> 00:43:02.720]
And if my son had it too, had the circumcision done, it was automatically done lately.

[00:43:03.420 --> 00:43:08.340]
But now, they're getting less and less, you know, automatically doing that.

[00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:14.280]
Because, you know, the things that are not there for no reason, natural selection,

[00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:15.600]
did put in...

[00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:16.680]
Like like your appendix.

[00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:17.660]
And your...

[00:43:17.660 --> 00:43:18.400]
And your tonsils.

[00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:20.380]
And your pendig...

[00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:20.560]
Right.

[00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:21.040]
Do you...

[00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:22.260]
Do you still take that?

[00:43:22.260 --> 00:43:23.900]
They're obsolete, just like Forskin.

[00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:25.400]
Well, not necessarily.

[00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:27.640]
The tonsils are not taken up.

[00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:31.800]
Forskin was fine back in the old days before guys had clothing on to kind of like protect

[00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:33.780]
their privates from the, you know, the elements.

[00:43:34.180 --> 00:43:38.960]
But even with the clothing on, when it's rubbing up against, they're all the time with no...

[00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:40.040]
Rubbing up against...

[00:43:58.500 --> 00:43:58.960]
No.

[00:43:59.220 --> 00:44:01.180]
But from my own experience, I'm saying.

[00:44:01.540 --> 00:44:01.680]
Yeah.

[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:06.980]
And it doesn't follow that you're not hygienic if you have, of course.

[00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:11.720]
You know, I've never missed a day with it, taking a shower for God knows how many years.

[00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:12.080]
Right.

[00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:15.780]
So it isn't necessarily dirty, not to...

[00:44:15.780 --> 00:44:19.020]
Of course not, just long as you got a good scrub brush and some nice lava.

[00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:19.560]
Right.

[00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:22.780]
And that's the thing I want to share with you.

[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:23.180]
Yeah.

[00:44:23.700 --> 00:44:25.120]
I've worked in...

[00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:27.000]
Well, you graduated from Michigan school.

[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:27.520]
No, I did not.

[00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:27.920]
I went to...

[00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:28.580]
Don't say graduate.

[00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:29.620]
Let's not get carried away.

[00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:31.680]
I was there for two years or a part of two years.

[00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:32.500]
So you're from...

[00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:32.520]
So you're from...

[00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:32.600]
So you're from...

[00:44:32.600 --> 00:44:32.620]
So you're from...

[00:44:32.620 --> 00:44:32.860]
So you're from...

[00:44:32.860 --> 00:44:33.080]
So you're from...

[00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:33.280]
So you're from...

[00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:34.680]
So you're from...

[00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:41.080]
So you're from...

[00:44:41.080 --> 00:44:41.640]
The weather is horrible.

[00:44:41.780 --> 00:44:42.240]
The weather is horrible.

[00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:43.560]
There are three weeks in the summer when the weather is good.

[00:44:43.740 --> 00:44:44.100]
It's beautiful.

[00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:45.260]
I was a upper.

[00:44:46.060 --> 00:44:47.800]
So I graduated from the northern Michigan school.

[00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:48.920]
I never was in the U.P.

[00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:49.560]
Yeah.

[00:44:50.060 --> 00:44:53.520]
It's gorgeous in the summer and really unspoiled, you know.

[00:44:53.720 --> 00:44:53.860]
Yeah.

[00:44:54.220 --> 00:44:56.180]
Well, lakes you could drink out of the spring water.

[00:44:56.360 --> 00:44:56.660]
Mm-hmm.

[00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:57.980]
But anyway, I've worked in...

[00:44:57.980 --> 00:45:00.140]
Well, like at Michigan State, we used to drink out of the red sea to river.

[00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:00.840]
Yeah.

[00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:01.340]
Not.

[00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:02.060]
Not.

[00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:04.360]
No, you get down that far.

[00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:05.100]
It's polluted.

[00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:06.120]
Very much so.

[00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:06.920]
But up in the north at the ocean.

[00:45:06.940 --> 00:45:07.620]
That's why we like it.

[00:45:07.700 --> 00:45:08.940]
We like the pollution in East Lansing.

[00:45:09.100 --> 00:45:09.400]
It's great.

[00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:12.000]
It's good for what else you I don't really care for

[00:45:12.500 --> 00:45:16.580]
Why not oh come on now get out of here. Well, I don't like Detroit

[00:45:16.580 --> 00:45:20.520]
Well, I don't like Detroit anymore either Detroit once upon a time was a marvelous place

[00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:27.200]
But that's ancient history now what was that ended in 1967 right which is now 20 seven years ago

[00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:31.240]
Yeah, now Detroit is basically a toilet. That's when they burn the city down right exactly

[00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:38.320]
Yeah, anyway the other thing I wanted to mention is I've worked in the addiction field for almost 30 years

[00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:45.640]
Running an alcohol drug abuse program. Yeah up there and down here and one of the things that I see is a big the only

[00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:54.220]
Option to solve not only the drug and alcohol problem or drug abuse problems is to legalize drugs

[00:45:54.220 --> 00:45:56.160]
Yeah, and I totally

[00:45:56.680 --> 00:46:01.240]
Not all drugs not heroin. Oh, I'm against any kind of drug use

[00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:05.200]
Any more than necessary, you know, yeah, but I think that

[00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:12.420]
Having it illegal is one of the worst things that you can do heroin too the thing is you don't I think they ought to take all these drugs

[00:46:12.420 --> 00:46:18.780]
Are as not these politicians put them on a plane send them over to Amsterdam over to Holland right let them see how they handle the problem over there

[00:46:18.780 --> 00:46:20.260]
They don't have anywhere near the problem

[00:46:20.260 --> 00:46:24.480]
They don't deal with it like in this hysterical juvenile way and they deal with it like adults

[00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:28.680]
And they don't have people murdering each other on the streets every day to give money to support the drug habit

[00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:34.100]
And it's just amazing how much more civilized they are oh, yeah, but it doesn't have to be

[00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:42.840]
An ex-associately accepted thing, you know like we socially accept alcohol to the degree that we advertise it all over the place

[00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:51.420]
Yeah, we got people we lose about 5,000 people a week get killed because of alcohol or die because of alcoholism we have another

[00:46:53.020 --> 00:46:56.580]
What is it 400,000 a year that died from tobacco?

[00:46:57.380 --> 00:47:01.480]
Because it's so it and I don't know well. It's an epidemic man. People are driving dropping like flies

[00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:03.000]
Where it's going around?

[00:47:03.380 --> 00:47:08.720]
I don't want to get too more more modeling on this because jazz talks enough about drugs on every show the last of lifetime

[00:47:08.720 --> 00:47:15.520]
But comparatively, you know compared to the illegal drugs, right which only kill probably a couple hundred people a week right

[00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:18.240]
legal ones

[00:47:19.260 --> 00:47:23.300]

[00:48:09.420 --> 00:48:11.020]

[00:48:12.180 --> 00:48:18.760]
God can't you hear that or a Regis Regis would do it Regis loves me is Regis in the computer is he on the thing?

[00:48:18.980 --> 00:48:21.480]
It's big deal. It's big in a boat. See I told you

[00:48:22.060 --> 00:48:23.260]

I'm telling you Regis we all love you, but cut the crap don't like take on anymore shows your heart is like barely

[00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:35.660]

[00:48:35.660 --> 00:48:39.160]
Oya clog them and he's wants to do the night show and a morning show

He wants to be all things to all people like maybe a dead pretty soon if you don't cut the crap

[00:48:43.820 --> 00:48:47.180]
Here's a mobile in the sunrise. Hello, a Neil yes, sir

[00:48:47.180 --> 00:48:51.660]
24-year-old heterosexual male and I love with Steve a Tyler all right

Coming up soon play it man play it all the way I'm gonna play it do it we're going out with it today

[00:49:00.080 --> 00:49:05.500]
Do it out and the song to while you know something about Stevie Tyler this may sound really grotesque and I

[00:49:05.500 --> 00:49:07.580]
How old is he now about 42 or three? I don't care

[00:49:07.580 --> 00:49:14.040]
No, but seriously the point is the thing that amazes me about him is here is a guy who is like a walking ad for doing drugs

[00:49:14.040 --> 00:49:17.440]
Which I don't you know condone doing hard drugs, but the guy like did every kind of drug

[00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:18.540]
He did everything wrong in his life

[00:49:18.540 --> 00:49:23.280]
He was like a total wreck and he's like 43 years old at least now and his body is in great shape

[00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:27.200]
And if he didn't look like his face didn't look like he just it was an escapee from the monkey jungle

[00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:30.540]
He'd be a hot number, you know I saw him once on Miami Beach

[00:49:30.540 --> 00:49:34.360]
Glotting while he puked. Yeah, it looked like death warm gover, but

[00:49:36.820 --> 00:49:40.420]
Yeah, I'll take him any day. Okay, hey, you'll have to fight me man

[00:49:40.420 --> 00:49:45.420]
Hey, Dale, I'll be calling you a lot more after February first. Why is that because I'll have to tell you a little one

[00:49:45.420 --> 00:49:50.500]
And I'll be able to call my pound line. All right, you know pound IOD calls in the channel for news desk right now

[00:49:50.500 --> 00:49:54.360]
Not that I've been chronically trying to test the rain. Yeah, we'll call up them and tell them pound this

[00:49:54.360 --> 00:49:59.060]
You got it. See you love you now. Okay. How do you like that? See already there's one

[00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:03.560]
For our new cellular one service which starts next Tuesday if we all show up Tuesday

[00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:05.400]
We might just take a day off on Tuesday

[00:50:06.440 --> 00:50:08.700]
In fact Rick and Suds aren't gonna be here at all next week

[00:50:08.700 --> 00:50:13.120]
They're going on vacation next week and they're practicing for it like a little here a little there getting used to it

[00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:18.140]
Or is erosmith might say permanent vacation they might give you use used to that

[00:50:18.140 --> 00:50:22.780]
But anyway, they're in randies doing afternoons next week and jazz is doing nights am I correct about that?

[00:50:23.140 --> 00:50:28.160]
Or is jazz doing nights with Chris next week? Is that part of the deal or is Chris doing this weekend in Tampa?

[00:50:29.540 --> 00:50:33.280]
I kept hearing him say last weekend that he was gonna be doing a show for mess you went this Sunday

[00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:39.100]
I believe pretty sure I'm feeling like maybe like who knows boy look at this convention of board ops

[00:50:39.100 --> 00:50:42.200]
We have in the other room now look at this man. It's just amazing in there

[00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:47.400]
But I'll tell you only one of them is gonna be the big hot shot star at that event on Sunday, man

[00:50:49.940 --> 00:50:53.520]

[00:50:54.600 --> 00:50:56.280]

[00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:22.820]
Orlando which way off 95 yeah from Orlando yeah

[00:51:24.380 --> 00:51:29.640]
Well, you have to get off on the Atlantic Boulevard exit you're coming south and you have to make a

[00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:37.120]
Right okay to Atlantic Boulevard. I you're gonna like this. Yes, you're rising part Mars and

[00:51:38.280 --> 00:51:44.800]
There's a guy that wife's sisters boyfriend. He's lived their always life

[00:51:44.800 --> 00:51:48.720]
You wait me your wife's sister's boyfriend. Yeah, got it

[00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:56.540]
And he's always back to station where there was Tony ballhead

Or something. Yeah, I had a

[00:51:59.240 --> 00:52:02.380]
20 ball DJ. Yeah, yeah, I was on

[00:52:02.380 --> 00:52:08.240]
Port on station in Fort Myers W. W. C. N. And you always said they didn't have an audience right they must not he's lived

[00:52:08.240 --> 00:52:12.860]
Or I think there was no station down here W. W. C. N. Exactly nobody even knows that it exists

[00:52:12.860 --> 00:52:17.500]
Seriously, they I got a copy of the last Arbitron book from the Fort Myers Naples area

[00:52:17.500 --> 00:52:22.720]
They aren't even listed not only don't they show up but when they have the listing in the front of the ratings book of all the stations

[00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:24.840]
They're not even listed. It's like they don't exist

[00:52:26.500 --> 00:52:31.620]
Well, I must not evidently that lost a good thing we keep waiting for you to come

[00:52:31.620 --> 00:52:39.320]
Yeah, 104 up here. Well, we're still working on it feverishly so I'm told I'm told by those people who claimed to know and lie a lot

[00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:45.380]
Oh sure hope so so keep hanging on anyway, it's already I'm gonna truck down to Miami to meet you and everything all right

[00:52:45.380 --> 00:52:49.800]
Where my dolphin jacket? Hope that and get one of those dolphin towels or something but uh

[00:52:50.380 --> 00:52:55.660]
I wouldn't drive around the block see Ron and Ron. I'm coming to Miami to meet you. Okay. We'll see you man. See you

[00:52:55.660 --> 00:53:00.940]
I do like that guy schlepping all the way down from Orlando. That's a tree and of course he's not coming to see Keith Sims

[00:53:00.940 --> 00:53:05.260]
Just a joke Keith. It's 147 at W. I. D. W. S. You end

[00:53:05.860 --> 00:53:10.420]
As far back now. What's got like eggplant and something really erotic on it onions and eggplant

[00:53:10.420 --> 00:53:15.260]
I think from Jeff at pizza lock. I hope you got some long songs you're gonna be playing on the coast of saffron

[00:53:15.260 --> 00:53:18.840]
Because about 45 minutes from now after you eat that trust me when I tell you man

[00:53:19.300 --> 00:53:19.680]
God

[00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:26.820]
That's the new slogan. Wait a minute. That's the new slogan at the pizza lock just one meal and make a sh** every time never fails

[00:53:27.660 --> 00:53:32.400]
Okay, here's a mobile in the Tampa. Hello. Johnny was sniffing the pie. He was sniffing it

[00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:37.000]
He had his nose in it a couple of comments on s u n promotions. Yes, sir

[00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:43.900]
I think it was a stroke of genius that they brought the old y and f logo in on the Ron and Ron billboards here in Tampa

[00:53:45.660 --> 00:53:51.680]
Really? Or did they just or they just paced up the old y and f billboards right and just cut it out and then put in the letters for s u n

[00:53:52.640 --> 00:53:55.240]
Oh, yeah, we're talking. Yes

[00:53:55.800 --> 00:53:58.660]
I want to know you think that's a velvita's thing probably

[00:53:59.840 --> 00:54:05.220]
No doubt he thought of that I would well now we're getting a little carried away probably had to call in a consultant for that

[00:54:05.220 --> 00:54:09.260]
I thought it would maybe was Ron and Ron's people who did it. Yeah, I was a geek

[00:54:09.820 --> 00:54:12.700]
You know what though? He's got these t-shirts that

[00:54:12.700 --> 00:54:18.540]
The months ago I've seen him on the Qt now that's the I think they would be the biggest thing since last year's cow

[00:54:18.540 --> 00:54:22.500]
Yeah, you're talking about the ones country what a country son son country

[00:54:22.500 --> 00:54:23.760]
Is that not a stroke of genius?

[00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:29.060]
And they got the band symbol over them on the back if you turn it on and one of those. Yeah, beautiful lovely

[00:54:29.060 --> 00:54:32.220]
What do you think of that? I think it's a typical man. At least they're consistent

[00:54:32.660 --> 00:54:34.740]
If you had your calendar and one of those

[00:54:34.740 --> 00:54:38.240]
They're being on the band sign now who is this which board off is this calling in?

[00:54:38.540 --> 00:54:43.860]
This sounds like Mike not because this is a board off convention that I'm calling right? Yeah, I believe it

[00:54:43.860 --> 00:54:48.340]
They're wearing feathers and uh and they're doing it. Well have a great day pal. That's a board off

[00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:51.280]
Here's uh, I'm Tony George. Here's Margate. Hello

[00:54:51.760 --> 00:54:56.180]
Margate. How you doing pretty good sir? Okay, that's good. You know, I hate to uh, and not that you have it

[00:54:56.180 --> 00:54:57.060]
P on our parade

[00:54:57.060 --> 00:55:02.140]
We don't have any topic. We've been everywhere from hockey to circumcision and a respite in between

[00:55:02.140 --> 00:55:04.220]
I'm not gonna mention that to you. I think this guy that I had

[00:55:04.220 --> 00:55:06.960]
Listen to while I was on hold to probably should accept that

[00:55:07.620 --> 00:55:09.600]
Seems like he needed more help exactly

[00:55:09.600 --> 00:55:15.600]
Anyway, uh, I'm a PI it's sitting a car all day long. Listen to you and a few months back you had mentioned

[00:55:15.600 --> 00:55:16.660]
I've got a

[00:55:17.520 --> 00:55:21.100]
Subgarine Husky you said he you're one of your pooches had ear mongue

[00:55:21.100 --> 00:55:25.840]
Yeah, and I just dumped about 350 dollars some refrigerated useless stuff from the vet

[00:55:26.300 --> 00:55:30.700]
And I never copied that stuff down that you said worked. Oh jeez. I know

[00:55:31.640 --> 00:55:33.600]
I wasn't even that crap George

[00:55:34.960 --> 00:55:39.080]
Uh for the dogs ears. I got some new stuff. That's the best ever, but I have no idea

[00:55:39.080 --> 00:55:43.000]
Toppagin now that that's good to see if that works T.O.P.A. G.E.N

[00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:43.980]
You got to get it from a vet

[00:55:44.440 --> 00:55:50.380]
But I have some newer stuff that I got this last time and his ears are so clean now that it's frightening over the counter stuff

[00:55:50.380 --> 00:55:54.000]
No, no, oh no, you got to get it from a vet. Yeah, you know, they rip you off like crazy

[00:55:54.540 --> 00:55:57.960]
And you know it really gets me about veterinarians they give these little tiny tubes

[00:55:57.960 --> 00:56:02.060]
That's just one little tiny squirt man, and there's nothing left in there. It's like 20 bucks

[00:56:02.060 --> 00:56:06.040]
I don't care how much it is because I love my dogs and I'm old to pay the price

[00:56:06.040 --> 00:56:08.820]
But at least give me a tube that's enough for like a day, you know

[00:56:09.680 --> 00:56:10.980]
My god, it's a joke

[00:56:10.980 --> 00:56:14.580]
They want you to keep running back and running back and running back. They keep you on a string

[00:56:14.580 --> 00:56:16.080]
It's very topogen

[00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:20.040]
Yep, we'll give it a shot and I'll check the name of that other thing

[00:56:20.040 --> 00:56:22.180]
I'll mention it tomorrow morning if you give a chance to listen

[00:56:22.180 --> 00:56:24.180]
Excellent. I appreciate it. Okay. See you

[00:56:24.840 --> 00:56:27.940]
Speaking of glad he brought that up man. He must be a psychic or a physics

[00:56:28.420 --> 00:56:32.380]
Because I neglected to mention professional pet products the pp guy

[00:56:32.380 --> 00:56:39.060]
PPP is the name of the company in Miami and John plant sends me a box here today a package of all kinds of good stuff

[00:56:39.060 --> 00:56:43.860]
What's in your package man and in the package I open it up and here's all this a dog stuff

[00:56:43.860 --> 00:56:48.660]
No, not that kind of dog stuff. I mean good dog stuff like a shampoo's and

[00:56:49.280 --> 00:56:50.880]
Flea and well, they don't have fleas or ticks

[00:56:50.880 --> 00:56:56.180]
But I mean just loads of it here's a therapeutic cream for like itching and here's some spray conditioner

[00:56:56.180 --> 00:56:58.620]
And just like a whole bunch of skincare stuff

[00:56:59.140 --> 00:57:03.520]
And it's from a guy named John plant who is the vice president of sales for ppp

[00:57:04.040 --> 00:57:05.700]
Professional pet products ink in Miami

[00:57:05.700 --> 00:57:08.340]
And he says congratulations on your continuing success

[00:57:08.340 --> 00:57:12.420]
I must admit I haven't had the pleasure of hearing your show, but understand that it is something else

[00:57:13.100 --> 00:57:15.060]
How do you like that? So we heard it through the rape fine

[00:57:15.060 --> 00:57:19.840]
And he heard that my dogs were having like a little bit of a problem and spends me a whole box of good stuff

[00:57:20.560 --> 00:57:22.060]
So I'm gonna take it home this afternoon

[00:57:22.060 --> 00:57:25.940]
I'm gonna spritz all of it on both dogs at the same time tomorrow. Let's you know how it came out

[00:57:30.340 --> 00:57:33.000]
So what do we say with the least today? I'm getting a message

[00:57:33.860 --> 00:57:36.300]
Put it away in the waste I just need to carry

[00:57:37.620 --> 00:57:38.640]
How about yogurt?

[00:57:46.780 --> 00:57:47.740]
Steve Carey

[00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:05.960]
Well

[00:58:37.920 --> 00:58:46.280]
Oh

[00:58:46.280 --> 00:58:46.600]
Me

[00:58:50.360 --> 00:58:50.780]
In

[00:59:03.960 --> 00:59:10.480]
It's down on me, yeah, I've got to tell you all the things

[00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:14.720]
It's been on my mind, but I've got to say

[00:59:17.440 --> 00:59:23.860]
We're partners in terms, we've got this very company

[00:59:23.860 --> 00:59:28.800]
What should you do to me, take my breath away

[00:59:29.800 --> 00:59:36.700]
You're my enemy, I'm on a street, and you never feel your guilt

[00:59:37.640 --> 00:59:43.340]
If I let go, I'll be ready for the day we see

[00:59:43.340 --> 00:59:48.040]
If I was trapped, we're gonna be together now

[00:59:48.040 --> 00:59:56.120]
I'm on a street, and I'm free with the heat

[00:59:57.500 --> 01:00:02.060]
I'm on a street, and I can't get you down

[01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:09.840]
Cause I'm on a street, and you never feel your guilt

[01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:17.600]
Oh!
