Huh he said unlikely maybe huh

[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:17.540]
Probably maybe victory will be there with your $20 but I doubt it here's a mobile in Miami. Hello on a Broward line

[00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:23.640]
Hey, I tried to call Friday, but it was so busy. It was like impossible to get through. Boy. I wish I had that feeling today

[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:33.420]
I want to be bad for Monday not too great. Okay. It's been all right. Okay. Yeah, isn't that something when the best game of the year is one at

[00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:35.520]
You lost that's a pretty sad comment. Yeah

[00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.720]
Well, the best part of it was when that guy dumped Benito right on his ass

[00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.860]
I loved it. That was the highlight for me too. He just he he went

[00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.960]
You know in fact, it was kind of like a half-hearted thing, you know the ball

[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:52.160]
It was you know he ducked out of the way and hit the bat didn't even hit him and then he got up and he kind of looked at the umpire like

[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.560]
Well, I think I played enough today. Let me get out of here

[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:55.680]
And he like went

[00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:00.280]
When sipping out there and a guy just picked him up and threw him down like a matchstick

[00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:01.760]
It was beautiful

[00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.920]
Why did you call on Friday?

[00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.880]
You made an analogy saying that

[00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.120]
Wayne High's Ingle would came to everybody's door and

[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.840]
Ten million dollars then came back and took it back. I would like to make an amendment to that

[00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:22.160]
He came to everybody's door and then it gave them ten million and came back and said well

[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.940]
We made a mistake give us back two million and keep eight

[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.860]
Yeah, that's not a perfect world, but we got tomorrow into the past there. So what the hell?

[00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:34.620]
Exactly what's everybody getting their nose out of joint four about Wayne

[00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.040]
I don't say something all true

[00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.820]
Colorado

[00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:44.160]
There are tendances down to how much how much they draw on 75,000 now I

[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:44.640]
Dr.

[00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:51.620]
Briefly whether they drop as much as the Marlins yeah, but everybody's down a little bright everybody's got to go down a little bit

[00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:54.860]
Right, we might get two million this two million would be reasonable

[00:05:54.860 --> 00:06:00.260]
That and so and so the good part of it is if you lost money last year drawn three million

[00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:05.080]
He loses asked doing two million this year so everybody should be happy about that. So what are they bet you about?

[00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:10.000]
What did he come out and say they lost money last year? Absolutely. They did say that. Yes, they did

[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.920]
And they do three million people

[00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:17.660]
I could tell you how we could save a million half real fast. I could tell you how it could save three point eight million

[00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:19.560]
Speaking of throwing down like a matchstick

[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:23.860]
Yeah, well you add them together. That's five and a half million bucks to get them out of ten

[00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:30.000]
Right what the hell is he waiting for? I'm getting more testing by the moment thinking about those two thinking about that pair

[00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:33.520]
Okay, take care. Okay, see you. Boy that was quick

[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:36.580]
Okay, we have an open line and day and seven five one in fact

[00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:39.400]
Maybe John Crock could come over and play first base. Okay?

[00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:45.640]
Maybe what we not what we don't need is more test these maybe what we need is a guy who can hit the ball, huh?

[00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:48.380]
That's something to think about

[00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:52.820]
No more test these at first base. We just traded for John Crock

[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:59.460]
All the Broward lines are wide open and I'm getting really pissed off about it at five two four nine four six three

[00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:05.080]
Are we going a little bit too fast five two four WI? Oh, D. Okay, you got it

[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:08.100]
12 after one at WI OD and WS UN

Malibu mansion why I'm not gonna go through this long story about the LAPD and how they beat the crap out of the car

[00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:31.760]
The reason she got it back is because she had a low jack tracking device buried in her bowels of her car

[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:38.060]

[00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:46.620]
So you don't ever ask me to do something on a Friday like over the whole long weekend because my memory won't hold it that long

[00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:49.340]
That's why I called you today. I don't want to be crying for anything

[00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:56.640]
No, I'll but I did think of it because it's sitting right on my living in my kitchen table. I figured I'd refresh you a little bit. Yeah

[00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:01.960]
So I'll bring that sheet into tomorrow. I got to go with all my other sheet. Yeah, I turned on the radio

[00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:07.660]
And you got a guy on the weekend billhoundry. Yeah, I think he plays on Saturday sometime. He plays it on Saturday

[00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:10.660]
He was doing something with tomorrow in baseball

[00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:16.220]
Are you aware of what happened Saturday? No, I'm not no it was bad

[00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:17.120]
I mean

[00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:27.040]
Yeah, I mean he was calling the game, but I don't think the game was going it was against the Giants. Yeah play a Giants game Saturday

[00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:29.440]
Uh-huh. Oh, so he did the game?

[00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:34.680]
You're asking me was he the one that called the game not the not for really wasn't no

[00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:38.400]
Oh, I'm sorry because he had maybe he was just fun in you, you know

[00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:42.080]
Maybe it was just like make believe like Phil generally tends to be like make believe

[00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:48.040]
Well, see now that's what I thought but I it went on for about old good hour. Well sure killed some good time. Oh obviously

[00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:50.360]
There you go. I turned it off and I was like

[00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:54.580]
And it was like and he he he swings

[00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:58.900]
Oh, no strike. Oh, nope. Is he's going back back back back back back back

[00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:04.120]
He's out. I'll tell you one thing Bob Green is enchanted with Phil Henry. He has a love affair

[00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:09.540]
And I think Phil's got some old pictures too. So well, I mean we love Phil Henry. It was a different kind of show

[00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:10.680]
Yeah, it's different

[00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:12.980]
If it was a baseball game he's

[00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:19.080]
Yeah, but considering it wasn't about baseball game. He's not so bad. Right there you go. Okay

[00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:23.520]
I'll bring that in for you tomorrow, Palli. If you wouldn't please me closing. Yes, I feel

[00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:26.960]
You're a douchebag. Okay. See you

[00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:30.940]
Two open lines of Broward that call was from Yankee Town

[00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:35.320]
So that hardly qualifies as a Broward call five two four nine four six three

[00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:39.000]
Maybe they're all at Harrison's market in sunrise. Is that possible?

[00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:42.540]
Maybe they're getting ready to help Cheryl kosher her house

[00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:45.840]
Let's go to the keys on the starline hello

[00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:49.820]
Yes, sir when I'm starting us to you when is to you man?

[00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:52.740]
Bota sata. Yeah, well, yeah, not too early still

[00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:57.680]
That was a hell of a Marlins game yesterday. I was watching it on canada feint date today

[00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:01.920]
Yeah down here and listening to it on the radio was that till Henry that was calling it on the radio?

[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.660]
evidently. Yeah, I'll be damn he's doing his impersonation to Joe Angel

[00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:08.620]
You know later while I was reading the latest issue of

[00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:12.700]
South Florida magazine and their article on Wayne's big land grab

[00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:19.160]
So you know, it's gotta be true because it was in South Florida. Yeah, I was thinking he wants to change the name of the stadium

[00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:23.640]
Now I don't want anybody to take this idea away from me now. You know how they changed the

[00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:27.540]
The name of Cape Canaveral to Cape Kennedy and everybody got all upset

[00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:34.980]
Yeah, and so they called it the Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral right I have the idea that you could maybe call it the

[00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:40.760]
Blockbuster football arena at Joe Robby Stadium. There you go

[00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:43.040]
I want anybody to take that

[00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:49.040]
From a serious one right I wanted to be strictly mine and Wayne's got to pay me money for this. Okay

[00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:53.680]
We'll send over a little sack for a little later on okay, Rowan? Yeah, that sounds great

[00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:58.460]
Okay, but I want you to know that I do go to the gym, but I don't hang out. Okay

[00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:03.040]
I had the same cable accident the bunny had the other day except I had it during a rick and such show

[00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:10.260]
And it got me so excited. I stuck my snooze bar together, you know with the radio clock radio thing. See ya. Thanks

Busting it is good enough for me

[00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:06.820]
Good enough for me and Bob a green

[00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:14.900]

But life isn't fair. No, that's what Jimmy Carter said look what happened to him. Yeah, I see you

[00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:31.680]

[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:49.860]
seen the big race there. Yeah when they had the winner

[00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:56.440]
I looked down in the winter circle and it looked like they should have played the godfather's theme

[00:28:56.820 --> 00:29:01.640]
With the wide-brem half hats and the black shirts and silk ties really and

[00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:04.100]
So I asked the fellow next to me

[00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:09.640]
So are these people yeah, they own the horse and they own the track

[00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:11.380]
It's the same

[00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:14.600]
So if you're going to high alia and you want to win

[00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:17.840]
Then you bet on the owner's horse. Yeah, that's a good idea

[00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:21.880]
Yeah, and one of the things like when you went to Tampa Baydowns when George Steinbrenner was the owner

[00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:24.620]
You bet on George Steinbrenner, which I think that's the way it works. Yeah

[00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:28.160]
That on his horse well there's one other thing that amused me there

[00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:33.600]
But when you go to pop no park don't necessarily bet on the horse owned by castle and farms because it's still running

[00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:39.480]
Oh, yeah, yeah, but one other thing amused me there. There was a in the program a lady owned the horse

[00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:42.260]
Her name was Mrs. E. H. Cox

[00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:47.740]
Yeah, C. K. S. Yeah, and a jockey in that same race

[00:29:48.380 --> 00:29:53.540]
Was named Marlon Sucky Suki Suki. Okay. Have a great day pal. Hey

[00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:58.660]
This guy's out of control man too many wide brimmed hats. I think we have an open line and date

[00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:02.560]
751 and one on the green line at 1 800

[00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:07.400]
Cox a hoist here's the four-letter deal. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. Yeah

[00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:09.760]
One-time listener first-time caller. Okay

[00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:14.620]
You're talking about the house. I was just going back from Scandinavian on sunrise there. Yes

[00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:19.620]
My house probably been there 13 years right and you're right. You're so right about what's going on in there

[00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:22.140]
We have showers in there that yes

[00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:26.620]
For showers and you got to turn around with it with a big stall with six showers

[00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:32.900]
That's where they all go to the gay people everything. Yeah, and they're in there stroking and doing everything making noises when they you know

[00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:38.000]
This has been going on for years. Yeah, and then we put a bat and they put a bathroom and they went to lock okay

[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:39.080]
You have your regular bathrooms

[00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:44.680]
They even took the locks under that bathroom. Yeah, because people were locking the door. They took the locks out of the bathroom

[00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:49.480]
I didn't put them on the bagels no dog. Yeah, yeah, because we were having sex in there locking the door really

[00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:54.620]
But we really took me out I was coming back and you were talking on the radio the airport sounds like the club bats to me

[00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:56.120]
Yeah, well whatever but

[00:30:56.120 --> 00:31:02.080]
What happened when you were talking about the house? I said I got a call you on this because of in the sauna and now they cut the steam

[00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:07.420]
The steam is broken and they're not gonna fix it because they're having they said they're having too much sex in there at night

[00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:12.720]
Yeah, and yeah, this is how much is too much? Uh, hello. I know, but I'm just saying

[00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:16.300]
I don't know if they know it too much. Are they if they taking a survey? Maybe they're having just enough

[00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:18.680]
Yeah, but I'm just kind of this stuff is going on. It's unbelievable

[00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:23.100]
When it starts affecting you like that, right? I mean, I don't care if people can do what they want

[00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:25.860]
I mean, but do you know have you know courtesy or whatever?

[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.840]
It's at least a polish hour curtain shot. Well, there's no shower curtain. Well, there you go

[00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:33.940]
That's what we need that would stop all of that now that now they're cutting out the steam which affects us

[00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:36.560]
Right, and that's not fair. I mean, you know, it's not right

[00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:42.760]
You know, and when I heard that I said I got a call you much bring the steam back man. That's what we say. Okay, okay

[00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:43.560]
I don't see it

[00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:47.860]
I would think it'd give pretty steamy in there anyway, wouldn't you? Huh?

[00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:50.120]
Yeah, there you go. He ought to know

[00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:53.920]
A man who's spent most of his time sharring with other jokts

[00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:59.900]
I wouldn't be surprised if mandatry would like Steve Stone and maybe even Rusty stop and look robotized. But what do I know

[00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:03.440]

I think Dave hides column this morning about how he's read the dolphins choked and they blew the playoffs

[00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:10.420]
And the panthers kind of choked and they didn't do the playoffs and the heat now are choked

[00:40:10.420 --> 00:40:14.480]
It's so tight that it they've cut off its oxygen. It can't breathe anymore. It's gasping

[00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:31.740]

[00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:37.960]
Managers are right. Yeah, they play that well, they play the whole thing, but at the end of it they play yes

[00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:45.440]
Yes, yes, are you serious? Yes, and that's not that's from the Colton. Yes, right and so and then another one at the end of it they played

[00:40:47.460 --> 00:40:48.740]
Managed doing yes

[00:40:52.540 --> 00:40:59.440]

[00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:01.500]

[00:41:05.820 --> 00:41:06.820]

[00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:29.420]

[00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:29.420]

[00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:29.420]

[00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:29.420]

[00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:29.420]

[00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:29.420]

[00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:29.420]
