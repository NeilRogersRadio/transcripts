he typed it out nice go and jack typed it out

[00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:39.700]
and uh of course they're all listening right now because they're monitoring naturally this this

[00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:43.600]
is the way they spend their hours is exposing themselves to things that they cannot stand that they

[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:48.180]
don't like because they're out there to protect everybody else they're out there to censor they're

[00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:52.180]
out there to dictate they're out there to decide what can be on and what should not be on and to

[00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:55.600]
try to tell sponsors where they should spend their money i'll be honest with you i'm looking at

weeks but who can wait that long you need the weight loss program that'll drop weight in

[00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:22.100]
second that's for me what is it it's saber genics isn't a pill or shake neither saber genics is

[00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:28.020]
a four foot long razor sharp sword that allows you to trim pounds in no time the how well how much

[00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:33.340]
weight you want to lose i don't know ten pounds and what would you say your leg weighs all from

here to here yeah i guess i do i say about ten there you go you're at your ideal weight in

[00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:50.380]
seconds and it's weight you'll keep on unlike those other yo yo plans saber genics by some today

[00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:39.320]
of characters that I like I don't want to know from Nina or the Pinta or the Sinta Marinta okay

[00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:46.080]
I know I've told this before and nobody believes me but I had a I had a teacher in sixth grade I

[00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:50.280]
think it was she used to call the three she used to call those three ships the Nina the Pinta and

[00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:54.620]
the Sinta Marinta which I guess either she was a lot dumber than I thought she was or she figured

[00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:58.400]
we were really dumb little kids and that's the only way we could remember them not the Santa Maria

[00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:04.180]
but the Sinta Marinta so and maybe it was what the hell do we know anybody ask Chris

[00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:11.380]
let's do Miami hello yeah hi Neil how you doing pretty good sir two things one real quick you were

[00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:15.480]
asking about John Wayne Bob and he was actually on Howard show live this I know it I didn't hear

[00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:19.360]
that part but I know he was on well you didn't miss my I understand that he was he was like in

[00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:22.580]
the background while they were talking to Ron Jeremy and all the other Harry Pornow guys well they

[00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:27.240]
started with John Wayne Bob at the guys got an IQ of a dark yeah he has no personality oh

[00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:32.940]
unbelievable yeah anyway what I really wanted to call you about was was this business about the

[00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:39.100]
education they were talking about my wife is a high school teacher yeah and just started this

[00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:44.020]
year and she brought home some stuff the other day that absolutely blew my mind he asked an essay

[00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:50.680]
question and the stuff they put down on paper honest to God in our generation would have been

[00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:57.900]
like a fourth grader yeah it was just mind boggling I can't believe that American education has

[00:23:57.900 --> 00:24:02.760]
has the worst the worst you know everything is relative so I realized there are countries where

[00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:07.100]
there are more illiterate people but they have an excuse with all the money and all the resources

[00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:11.940]
that we have and all the money we pee down the drain on garbage we have no excuse here so I would

[00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:16.660]
say relatively speaking we have the worst education of any of the industrialized countries in the world

[00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:24.080]
the absolute worst when when you look when you look at how the policies of inclusion have have come

[00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:29.080]
to where they are today and I agree with them but what they've done is they've they've lowered

[00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:36.120]
the standards for everybody yeah so that nobody comes out bright right it's it's just mind boggling

[00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:40.860]
the dumbing of the public right that woman the that letter of the editor was right on target it's

[00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:47.100]
with dumbing down man it's just it's scary yeah it's really and of course the powers that be the

[00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:51.660]
business of people in the politician all all the real power brokers that's the way they like it man

[00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:56.000]
keep them real stupid manipulate them use that tube to put everything in their brain and brain wash

[00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:01.740]
them and it's working like a charm oh yeah well maybe there's some hope but I don't know where

[00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:05.960]
not in this country see yeah good luck to us pali right thanks for your uplifting call now he's

[00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:09.560]
right on target he's absolutely right I know it's it's the real downer we don't want to get people

[00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:13.060]
down we're here to give people a chuckle or two we don't want to you know dwell on these things

[00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:16.680]
because we're not going to solve it here on the damn radio right all we got to do is call up the

[00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:21.200]
populous party or Florida and the aFA they'll straighten all you bastards out I tell you that right

[00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:29.200]
now ain't that right man well I saw that Confederate flag and and I'm sitting here looking at it like

[00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:33.920]

mat how about running like i get a better idea why don't they run like all the spots like a half

[00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:22.900]
hour back to back that would be good then they'd have a whole half hour show and uh uh just like

[00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:28.600]
here's 30 minutes of spots this is a true story when i first came to wion z and replaced Alan

[00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:33.100]
Burke the dean may he rest in peace at night and come to find out from his producer that what he

[00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:37.400]
would do depending on what the movie was in how surley he was on a given night sometimes he would

[00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:41.540]
like get to rambling and he would uh reading his poetry whatever the hell he was doing and didn't

[00:42:41.540 --> 00:42:46.420]
want to take his breaks for the spots so he would like back up a whole hours worth of spots maybe

[00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:50.280]
they had like 10 minutes worth of spots in that hour 11 minutes whatever was he would back up all

[00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:55.080]
the breaks until the end of the hour and it would get to be about 12 minutes before the hour and he

[00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:58.820]
would like have the producer run all the spots and then go into the CBS news at the top of the

[00:42:58.820 --> 00:43:06.280]
hour excellent formatics baby when i'm on the air nobody else needs to be on the air dummy do we

[00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:25.240]
I'm work to all you went to see

[00:45:26.740 --> 00:45:29.640]
Your pal Joey can turn a screw

[00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:36.280]
Now you're in jail with your own TV crew

[00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:40.660]
Take a big ol' screw for money

[00:45:42.260 --> 00:45:46.240]
Ame what you gonna do

[00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:51.140]
Joey, but a fool too

[00:45:51.140 --> 00:45:55.720]
Work, work, now you're in jail with all the money too

[00:46:02.940 --> 00:46:08.620]
I can see why you think that you got it made

[00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:14.500]
Pull the wall over our eyes, a media shriek

[00:46:14.500 --> 00:46:21.580]
Now I can see that it isn't only you, it's you all three

[00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:28.380]
It's all money making try to sphere a sea

[00:46:30.500 --> 00:46:37.500]
Grab a big ol' stack of money Ame what you gonna do

[00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:42.960]
Joey, but a fool too

[00:46:43.900 --> 00:46:47.580]
Take a big step of jail and all the money too

[00:46:47.580 --> 00:46:50.540]
Won't you, won't you

[00:46:50.540 --> 00:46:53.020]
What do they want from him? He didn't do nothing

[00:46:53.020 --> 00:46:56.820]
He didn't do nothing, all the money left alone

[00:46:56.820 --> 00:46:58.740]
One 19 and W-W-I-D

[00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:01.600]
That's the amazing part of what's going on today

[00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:03.920]
And most people are too stupid to realize it

[00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:08.900]
The people who become famous are the ones who are notorious because they're so grotesque and such assholes

[00:47:08.900 --> 00:47:12.680]
Whether it's the Jews, whether it's Joey, but a Foucault and Aimee Fisher

[00:47:12.680 --> 00:47:15.100]
Whether it's Tanya Harding and the Jeff Galuli

[00:47:15.100 --> 00:47:17.740]
These are the people who like John Bobbitt

[00:47:18.540 --> 00:47:20.500]
Who after he had his thing, he was sliced off

[00:47:20.500 --> 00:47:23.320]
Still got busted again like beating up some women

[00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:26.560]
Because he's just basically an angry kind of a guy

[00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:30.540]
Somebody who sliced yours off, you'd probably be a little angry about it too

[00:47:30.540 --> 00:47:32.120]
So what's wrong, he takes it out on some bitch

[00:47:32.120 --> 00:47:32.720]
I'm sorry

[00:47:33.540 --> 00:47:36.900]
Here's that was a very bad thing to say right before this lady in Cooper City

[00:47:36.900 --> 00:47:37.240]
Hello

[00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:38.640]
Boy, that's your wife

[00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:39.760]
That was a bad segue

[00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:41.580]
Well, it was just a joke, just a joke

[00:47:41.580 --> 00:47:43.300]
Okay, I'll accept that

[00:47:43.300 --> 00:47:43.580]
Of course

[00:47:44.300 --> 00:47:47.140]
I'd rather spend an evening with you than how it's done

[00:47:47.140 --> 00:47:47.940]
Okay

[00:47:47.940 --> 00:47:48.820]
And I'm a lady

[00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:50.200]
Yeah

[00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:51.040]
Yeah, okay

[00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:53.860]
Well, you'd be with me would be interesting, not too exciting, but interesting

[00:47:53.860 --> 00:47:56.360]
Well, that's because I enjoy this, you make me laugh

[00:47:56.360 --> 00:47:57.860]
Well, that's good, okay

[00:47:57.860 --> 00:47:59.700]
So, a couple of questions

[00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:05.260]
You know, I was busy with the high holidays here and I didn't read the paper, watched the news

[00:48:05.260 --> 00:48:05.900]
Oi

[00:48:05.900 --> 00:48:11.700]
But I thought the casinos were in and yesterday I think in the hair of their face

[00:48:11.700 --> 00:48:13.240]
What do you mean you thought they were in?

[00:48:13.540 --> 00:48:15.800]
I thought everybody would both of them this time

[00:48:16.520 --> 00:48:19.060]
And I guess I'm...I guess I should have

[00:48:19.060 --> 00:48:20.500]
Why they had another poll yesterday?

[00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:26.860]
Yeah, in the paper, it would be the yesterday or today saying that 56% are against them

[00:48:26.860 --> 00:48:27.140]
Yeah

[00:48:27.140 --> 00:48:28.700]
And I think...

[00:48:28.700 --> 00:48:33.180]
But they haven't even started their campaign yet, which is going to start...

[00:48:33.180 --> 00:48:33.980]
No, they're starting today, I think

[00:48:33.980 --> 00:48:36.320]
Right, in a day or two they're going to be starting their big push

[00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:41.020]
And now they're going to start brainwashed, I mean educating the public and getting to understand the reality of things

[00:48:41.020 --> 00:48:42.420]
Well, I sure hope they wake up

[00:48:42.420 --> 00:48:44.220]
And I know you'll believe you're best

[00:48:44.220 --> 00:48:49.480]
I'm doing...Listen, I'm going to vote 400 times on election day and everybody I know I hope they vote at least two, three times

[00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:51.680]
Well, I'm going to vote two, so tell everybody before

[00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:52.580]
I'm going to do it

[00:48:52.580 --> 00:48:53.660]
It's about time

[00:48:53.660 --> 00:48:56.820]
I like your outlook on different subjects

[00:48:56.820 --> 00:49:01.040]
Do you have any outlook on their kid with all the transplants today?

[00:49:01.420 --> 00:49:03.980]
Did the state is paying half a million dollars for it?

[00:49:03.980 --> 00:49:04.800]
I didn't hear that

[00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:09.380]
Oh, that's been in the news for a couple of years that his mother couldn't afford it

[00:49:09.380 --> 00:49:12.000]
And the state said that they wouldn't pay for it

[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:16.560]
And then I think it went to the Supreme Court and made it one of courts, we have to pay for it

[00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:16.840]
Yeah

[00:49:18.320 --> 00:49:21.660]
Well, maybe at the same time we'll just put crime boy in the electorate here

[00:49:21.660 --> 00:49:23.820]
We won't have to pay for him anymore so we can make up for it

[00:49:23.820 --> 00:49:24.980]
Have a great day

[00:49:24.980 --> 00:49:28.220]
Hey, listen, I love Luis Miguel, I demand to me

[00:49:28.220 --> 00:49:29.960]
Well, I almost stuck my finger on

[00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:33.520]
And I miss his five minute to two concert every day

[00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:36.000]
Well, this way you can listen in the privacy of your own thing all day

[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:38.740]
One minute, one minute, one minute, one minute, five to two

[00:49:38.740 --> 00:49:40.100]
Okay, hang on

[00:49:40.100 --> 00:49:40.620]
Thank you

[00:49:40.620 --> 00:49:41.660]
She's telling me what to do

[00:49:41.660 --> 00:49:42.600]
Okay, she's on five

[00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:45.180]
Hey, listen, I played him the other day when I came back from the concert

[00:49:45.180 --> 00:49:46.180]
It was a beautiful thing

[00:49:46.180 --> 00:49:49.420]
And I still think about that El LaDia Camercatus, man

[00:49:49.420 --> 00:49:51.960]
That was a, oh, that guy with a big Italian accordion

[00:49:52.520 --> 00:49:55.120]
There's nothing like a big Italian accordion

[00:49:55.120 --> 00:49:57.980]
And it was just a nice thing

[00:49:57.980 --> 00:50:01.080]
Of course, like I said, those Mexicans, they're just a little unruly a few of them

[00:50:01.080 --> 00:50:05.460]
I mean, most of the people are like 1,500 people jam-packed into that room like Mexican jumping beans

[00:50:05.460 --> 00:50:09.500]
And all it takes is like a half a dozen of unruly people who have no consideration for anybody else

[00:50:09.500 --> 00:50:12.780]
And of course, with my luck, they happen to be at the table right next to me center stage

[00:50:13.340 --> 00:50:14.740]
Sit down already, get out of here

[00:50:14.740 --> 00:50:18.020]
I mean, when they got to get the Carson County Sheriff's people and they drag some of these people out

[00:50:18.020 --> 00:50:22.100]
That should give you an idea, but it only went on for like the first 40 or 50 minutes of a two hour concert

[00:50:22.100 --> 00:50:23.300]
So, what can I tell you?

[00:50:23.860 --> 00:50:27.380]
And of course, by that time, it's sung like 90% of everything that I wanted to see in here

[00:50:27.380 --> 00:50:29.880]
And like, you know, get out of the way, I want to take a look at this guy

[00:50:29.880 --> 00:50:31.420]
Let's say, you know, can that be felt?

[00:50:32.060 --> 00:50:34.260]
No, sit-du, it was just, it was beautiful

[00:50:34.680 --> 00:50:40.320]
So I hope to see October 7th that we got, we got, so finally we're getting to that part of the year when there's a little stuff going on now

[00:50:41.220 --> 00:50:44.480]
We got October 4th, we got the overall, let's start first things first

[00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:50.660]
This Tuesday the 27th, we got the first Panther game of the year, it's the only exhibition game at home this year against the lightning

[00:50:51.260 --> 00:50:54.680]
So even though it's an exhibitionist game still, we got a, we got a team that we hate like Poison

[00:50:54.680 --> 00:50:57.360]
We got to pack that place Tuesday, I'll be there with bells on

[00:50:58.360 --> 00:51:02.320]
Then the 4th of October, the flyers will be here opening regular season game of the Panthers

[00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:08.620]
That's on Tuesday, Thursday night is, who the hell we play on Thursday? I think the St. Louis Blues, that's right

[00:51:08.620 --> 00:51:13.280]
Then on the, the next night Friday the 7th is the night I'll be there with the Louis Miguel concert at the night center

[00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:14.740]
He'll be here the 6th, 7th and 8th

[00:51:14.740 --> 00:51:19.420]
And Saturday afternoon we got the Ranger game and Poppano Park opens Friday the 7th

[00:51:19.420 --> 00:51:23.260]
So my first day of the night will be the 8th, oh my god, heavy duty

[00:51:23.260 --> 00:51:27.660]
See? Sooner or later if you wait long enough in this boring God for sake in toilet of a place that we live in

[00:51:27.660 --> 00:51:30.700]
Sooner or later things come in good bunches

[00:51:31.180 --> 00:51:32.580]
123 at WIOD

[00:51:32.580 --> 00:51:41.600]
Hi, I'm Bob Green, General Manager of WIOD Radio, encouraging you to listen to the Phil Hendry show every afternoon 2-6 right here on WIOD

[00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:45.500]
I don't agree with everything he says, but excuse me

[00:51:45.500 --> 00:51:49.900]
The payphone challenge, news from around the planet and a lot more

[00:51:49.900 --> 00:51:53.440]
It's Rick and Sons, weekday mornings right here

[00:51:55.220 --> 00:51:55.860]
WIOD

[00:51:55.860 --> 00:51:59.040]
So, where's the Davey Gravy line?

[00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:02.740]
127 at WIOD, maybe Davey's up at Delaware Ohio for a little brown chug

[00:52:02.740 --> 00:52:04.520]
Tom the accountant, how you doing Tom?

[00:52:04.580 --> 00:52:08.760]
Hi my friend, it's tax here, you won't believe it, it must be 58,000 people here

[00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:09.560]
How's the weather?

[00:52:09.940 --> 00:52:11.780]
Gorgeous, absolutely magnificent

[00:52:11.780 --> 00:52:12.560]
That's what we like

[00:52:12.560 --> 00:52:16.480]
It's like 80 degrees, the race is fine, the track is fast, it's a standard

[00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:18.880]
Now what time are these eliminations going to go off?

[00:52:19.220 --> 00:52:21.520]
I mean what time is the first elimination, you know Tom?

[00:52:22.600 --> 00:52:24.640]
Probably by now or from now

[00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:28.960]
Great, so in other words by the time we get to the final I'll be home to be able to see it on TV

[00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:31.040]
That is correct, hold on, I'll give you Tomy House

[00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:31.300]
Great

[00:52:32.820 --> 00:52:33.140]
Hello

[00:52:33.860 --> 00:52:34.900]
Hey Tomy, how you doing?

[00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:35.620]
Neil, how you doing?

[00:52:35.780 --> 00:52:40.060]
Great, fantastic, now our friend Tom there what he did is he faxes me three pages

[00:52:40.420 --> 00:52:44.100]
Two of them are the same page, so instead of having like all the eliminations here

[00:52:44.100 --> 00:52:46.120]
I don't have the race that you're in, now I assume

[00:52:47.020 --> 00:52:50.120]
So it really gives me an opportunity to have an intelligent conversation with you

[00:52:50.120 --> 00:52:53.780]
But magical Mike is the horse you train, Michael is chancest still driving am I right?

[00:52:54.220 --> 00:52:57.220]
And is that I guess is going to be the one that Falcons future is in?

[00:52:57.620 --> 00:52:57.920]
Yes

[00:52:57.920 --> 00:52:59.300]
And that's the horse to beat?

[00:52:59.780 --> 00:53:01.280]
Him and historic, yes

[00:53:01.280 --> 00:53:01.920]
And historic

[00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:05.780]
Now how's magical Mike been racing last three four starts?

[00:53:06.040 --> 00:53:10.080]
He won his last start a week and a half ago at Toyota 52 and one

[00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:10.960]
Very good

[00:53:10.960 --> 00:53:11.660]
Beautiful

[00:53:11.660 --> 00:53:13.200]
And what post have you got?

[00:53:13.600 --> 00:53:13.980]
Two hole

[00:53:13.980 --> 00:53:15.320]
Well there you go not bad

[00:53:15.320 --> 00:53:17.160]
He had helped on the inside and I have a small traction

[00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:20.140]
Yeah you better believe it, I'm looking at these other two and of course everybody

[00:53:20.140 --> 00:53:25.280]
Cam's card charts still going to be the favorite in the rich get richer he draws the rail as if he needs the extra help with John Campbell

[00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:29.440]
So he's going to be almost a certain lock in at first in that one elimination

[00:53:29.440 --> 00:53:29.980]
Exactly

[00:53:29.980 --> 00:53:33.600]
And then I'm looking at the other one of course Pacific Rock and another Bill Robinson horses in there

[00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:36.560]
But I'm looking at this three horse slick pavement with my friend Dave Palone

[00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:41.440]
This horse qualified at the Meadows on a 16th of September wins by 22 lengths

[00:53:41.440 --> 00:53:44.680]
52 and four with the last half and 54 and four

[00:53:44.680 --> 00:53:45.640]
Yeah it's thick

[00:53:46.820 --> 00:53:49.960]
Sometimes horses will do that when they're not in against anyone looking at him you know

[00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:52.280]
So who knows I mean it's very good though

[00:53:52.280 --> 00:53:56.740]
So what do you think on the half mile track because I know that of course from the rail we got a different story

[00:53:56.740 --> 00:54:01.700]
Because back in the cane Cam's card chart through the five hole and he got parked a mile and of course the

[00:54:01.700 --> 00:54:04.600]
Quentin finished fifth but from the rail can anybody beat him?

[00:54:05.120 --> 00:54:07.020]
It doesn't seem to be that way no

[00:54:07.900 --> 00:54:10.820]
No one could beat him I don't think in the first he anyway

[00:54:10.820 --> 00:54:14.960]
Okay and what about in the other he with the Pacific Rock and slick pavement?

[00:54:15.360 --> 00:54:19.660]
Uh, Pacific Rock and I think is the best in there because they got a horse with the rail too

[00:54:19.660 --> 00:54:20.780]
That's going to control the race

[00:54:20.780 --> 00:54:22.100]
Expensive scooter with Campbell

[00:54:22.100 --> 00:54:27.280]
And then going to come Pacific Rock and they'll probably be sitting one too so that's tough there

[00:54:27.280 --> 00:54:30.740]
As usual Bill Robinson's always one too and then in your heat?

[00:54:31.540 --> 00:54:38.060]
Uh, well hopefully us everything's going on fold in the first turn just to

[00:54:38.060 --> 00:54:40.940]
Heat that's tough is maybe more tougher Colts than one heat

[00:54:40.940 --> 00:54:42.920]
What post position Falcon future draw?

[00:54:43.300 --> 00:54:45.260]
He's got the three or the four he's got the three I think

[00:54:45.260 --> 00:54:45.620]
Uh-huh

[00:54:45.620 --> 00:54:50.340]
The storage four I think or five so they're all all right in the ball game in the first turn

[00:54:50.340 --> 00:54:55.100]
So you got a fast track a beautiful day a big crowd time says and all I can suggest you is to keep

[00:54:55.100 --> 00:54:58.480]
At least one finger in here because we don't want Roger Houston breaking your eardrums

[00:54:58.480 --> 00:54:58.780]
Exactly

[00:54:58.780 --> 00:55:00.300]
Okay good luck Tommy

[00:55:00.300 --> 00:55:00.780]
Very good

[00:55:00.780 --> 00:55:01.780]
Okay good talk and do

All right now we're talking

[00:55:21.420 --> 00:55:21.960]
Okay

[00:55:21.960 --> 00:55:25.640]
Our friend Tom the accountant who's a real harness racing nut every year he goes up there to Delaware

[00:55:25.640 --> 00:55:26.740]

And that's good our buddy Tommy Houghton who's got magical miconairid boy

[00:55:30.920 --> 00:55:36.280]
Almost feel like I was there but like I said Roger Houston keep those earplugs in don't pop the plugs until the race is over

[00:55:36.280 --> 00:55:40.920]
Because he is screaming and puking your maniac Roger here's highly a hello

[00:55:42.400 --> 00:55:43.280]
No sitoo

[00:55:43.280 --> 00:55:43.900]
No sitoo

[00:55:44.420 --> 00:55:45.060]
Beto yo

[00:55:45.920 --> 00:55:47.480]
You're whispering too low

[00:55:47.480 --> 00:55:48.280]
Hey Neil

[00:55:48.280 --> 00:55:49.040]
Can't hear you

[00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:50.060]

And then you said crap on the ear

[00:56:01.080 --> 00:56:01.980]

Did you say crap are you the guy that said crap yesterday

[00:56:04.660 --> 00:56:05.060]

[00:56:05.060 --> 00:56:05.700]

Apologize profusely

[00:56:08.020 --> 00:56:09.680]
Big for forgiveness

[00:56:10.520 --> 00:56:11.580]

It was my fault

[00:56:18.920 --> 00:56:19.660]
It was your fault

[00:56:19.660 --> 00:56:22.500]

I'm tired because it happens again your S.O.L.

Hang on he's on to get him real quick because his phone blows

[00:56:31.200 --> 00:56:31.840]
Oops

[00:56:31.840 --> 00:56:32.580]
Yeah

[00:56:34.700 --> 00:56:35.960]
Whoops there it is

[00:56:36.740 --> 00:56:39.240]
We have an open line on the purple line at pound I.O.D.

[00:56:39.240 --> 00:56:42.280]
My God they're doing it at Delaware Ohio

[00:56:42.280 --> 00:56:43.260]
Little Brown Jug Pompa

[00:56:43.260 --> 00:56:45.420]
It'll park will be reopening for the fall meeting a couple of weeks

[00:56:45.420 --> 00:56:47.260]
And Luis Miguel coming

[00:56:47.260 --> 00:56:49.900]
Well it's just all of a sudden life is almost worth living here

[00:56:49.900 --> 00:56:51.260]
Almost underline the almost

[00:56:52.280 --> 00:56:54.960]
But we got the Confederate flag over here

[00:56:54.960 --> 00:56:57.260]
They poppulous party of Florida in the AFA

[00:56:57.260 --> 00:56:59.940]
Who seem to be kissing cousins there together up there in the tree

[00:56:59.940 --> 00:57:03.500]
They're they're picking and grinning man and they got they got a plan up there sleeve

[00:57:03.500 --> 00:57:06.640]
Of course you can't see their sleeve because it's underneath the sheets

[00:57:07.740 --> 00:57:10.140]
Let's go to our vital on the starline hello

[00:57:10.140 --> 00:57:10.500]
Neil

[00:57:10.500 --> 00:57:11.100]
Yes sir

[00:57:11.100 --> 00:57:11.640]
What happened to maybe

[00:57:12.220 --> 00:57:12.960]
We're doing it

[00:57:12.960 --> 00:57:13.720]
Couple of things

[00:57:13.720 --> 00:57:14.120]
Yes

[00:57:14.120 --> 00:57:18.220]
First of all I was so happy to see

[00:57:18.220 --> 00:57:19.800]
Very swishers

[00:57:19.800 --> 00:57:22.260]
Picket his nose and Jerry Jones

[00:57:22.260 --> 00:57:23.620]
I think they're gonna win

[00:57:23.620 --> 00:57:24.060]
And Louis

[00:57:24.060 --> 00:57:25.680]
Yes I agree wholeheartedly

[00:57:25.680 --> 00:57:26.280]
Let's get out of here

[00:57:26.280 --> 00:57:28.380]
I was saying go detried baby go you lines

[00:57:28.380 --> 00:57:30.180]
How sickening are those guys

[00:57:30.180 --> 00:57:33.640]
Yeah I would have been very upset because I went to bed in the third quarter

[00:57:33.640 --> 00:57:36.960]
And lines were head I think 20 do a seven at that point something like that

[00:57:36.960 --> 00:57:39.800]
And I'd have been really psychotic if I had to you know

[00:57:39.800 --> 00:57:41.500]
Had a sit through Dallas making a big comeback

[00:57:41.500 --> 00:57:44.040]
And then thinking they were gonna escape with at least a tie

[00:57:44.040 --> 00:57:46.960]
But Mitch Mitch nearly blew it he under threw a couple of guys

[00:57:46.960 --> 00:57:48.360]
He nearly blew it but they hung on

[00:57:48.360 --> 00:57:50.460]
He looked pretty good the part of the game I saw

[00:57:50.460 --> 00:57:52.020]
Yeah but towards the end he looked terrible

[00:57:52.020 --> 00:57:52.280]
Yeah

[00:57:52.280 --> 00:57:53.820]
Oh he looked but you can tell he was rattled

[00:57:53.820 --> 00:57:55.300]
But second of all in that

[00:57:55.860 --> 00:57:57.680]
Luckily you don't get to read the Palm Beach post

[00:57:58.160 --> 00:58:01.680]
But there was an article by a guy called John Neese

[00:58:01.680 --> 00:58:05.500]
Oh the guy deserves to be on a missing food label

[00:58:05.500 --> 00:58:06.180]
About what?

[00:58:06.260 --> 00:58:08.580]
Saying why gambling is a bad bet

[00:58:08.580 --> 00:58:09.360]
Oh yeah Florida

[00:58:09.360 --> 00:58:10.120]
Oh sure

[00:58:10.120 --> 00:58:11.420]
Oh my god it was 60

[00:58:12.100 --> 00:58:13.340]
I mean he's stupid

[00:58:13.340 --> 00:58:14.700]
Oh no wait a minute

[00:58:14.700 --> 00:58:17.220]
That's the same guy that writes for the Sun Sentinel

[00:58:17.220 --> 00:58:18.540]
You mean Jack Neese?

[00:58:18.860 --> 00:58:19.220]
Jack Neese

[00:58:19.220 --> 00:58:21.440]
Yeah that's a guy NEASE I read that the other day

[00:58:21.440 --> 00:58:22.060]
Oh okay

[00:58:22.060 --> 00:58:23.620]
Yeah they got that out of the Sun Sentinel there

[00:58:23.620 --> 00:58:25.820]
I guess he just writes the one propaganda piece

[00:58:25.820 --> 00:58:27.360]
And they're gonna print it in papers all over the state

[00:58:27.360 --> 00:58:28.880]
Oh it's a lot easier that way

[00:58:28.880 --> 00:58:30.260]
So you were lucky enough to read it

[00:58:30.260 --> 00:58:30.500]
Yeah

[00:58:30.500 --> 00:58:32.460]
Alright was that pathetic or what?

[00:58:32.540 --> 00:58:34.420]
Awful just said really tragic

[00:58:34.420 --> 00:58:37.860]
Just another mouth piece for all these selfish bastards

[00:58:37.860 --> 00:58:39.220]
You want to keep everything to themselves

[00:58:39.220 --> 00:58:40.820]
And that's it that's the name of the game

[00:58:40.820 --> 00:58:42.200]
What do you think of the chance?

[00:58:43.220 --> 00:58:44.600]
Because the seminoles

[00:58:44.600 --> 00:58:47.080]
They're not gonna do anything until the vote comes back

[00:58:47.080 --> 00:58:47.780]
That's right and it

[00:58:48.440 --> 00:58:49.760]
That's the deal man like I said before

[00:58:49.760 --> 00:58:52.240]
Either we get it or the Indians are gonna get it

[00:58:52.240 --> 00:58:54.280]
Either we get all the benefit, we get the revenue

[00:58:54.280 --> 00:58:55.220]
Or just give it to them

[00:58:55.220 --> 00:58:55.800]
That's the choice

[00:58:55.800 --> 00:58:56.740]
I mean one way or the other

[00:58:56.740 --> 00:58:59.020]
It's gonna be here whether these the antithols like it or not

[00:58:59.020 --> 00:59:01.340]
So they can make up their mind if they want to reap some benefits

[00:59:01.340 --> 00:59:03.100]
Or if they just want to hand it over to the Indians

[00:59:03.100 --> 00:59:05.760]
Maybe I'm gonna vote how many times can we vote?

[00:59:05.880 --> 00:59:06.540]
It's make times we want?

[00:59:06.680 --> 00:59:07.720]
72 I think

[00:59:07.720 --> 00:59:10.780]
Right I'm gonna vote 72 and throw my kids

[00:59:10.780 --> 00:59:11.120]
Okay

[00:59:11.600 --> 00:59:12.640]
See you, Aasticae

[00:59:12.640 --> 00:59:13.900]
Good luck to us baby

[00:59:13.900 --> 00:59:15.140]
November the 8th

[00:59:15.140 --> 00:59:16.900]
Vote early and often for Casino gambling

[00:59:16.900 --> 00:59:18.760]
And vote for Governor Walkenlotton man

[00:59:18.760 --> 00:59:21.140]
Because anybody that pops pro-zac all day can't be all bad

[00:59:21.140 --> 00:59:23.140]
Not that he's good but look at the opposition

[00:59:23.140 --> 00:59:27.020]
Talk about chilling, talk about right wing, talk about Confederate flags

[00:59:27.020 --> 00:59:29.240]
Talk about the antithol, talk about repression

[00:59:29.240 --> 00:59:31.540]
We're talking about the Bushman baby

[00:59:32.420 --> 00:59:34.560]
Never been too big on Bush, I gotta be honest with you

[00:59:35.040 --> 00:59:36.440]
135 at WIOD

[00:59:37.640 --> 00:59:40.280]
This afternoon at two don't miss Phil Hendry

[00:59:40.280 --> 00:59:42.740]
Every one of him right here

[00:59:42.740 --> 00:59:43.780]
Earned belapel

[00:59:46.100 --> 00:59:46.580]
WIOD

[00:59:47.580 --> 00:59:48.540]
Get Bush

[00:59:48.540 --> 00:59:49.700]
Hey, you're mad

[00:59:49.700 --> 00:59:51.420]
It's bad, it's bad

[00:59:51.420 --> 00:59:53.140]
It's good, it's good

[00:59:57.680 --> 00:59:59.440]
You're made to cry

[01:00:02.980 --> 01:00:10.900]
What I saw on the news is hard to believe Michael Jackson just married Melissa Marie's a weirdo

[01:00:10.900 --> 01:00:11.440]
Woohoo

[01:00:13.860 --> 01:00:15.860]
Baby that's no lie

[01:00:19.220 --> 01:00:26.140]
Because of their one thing that she don't need it some more tabloid publicity with the weirdo

[01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:29.020]
He's a weirdo

[01:00:29.540 --> 01:00:31.820]
I guess that I don't understand

[01:00:32.540 --> 01:00:35.580]
Though she won a man in man

[01:00:35.580 --> 01:00:39.300]
This guy ain't lovin' not on the way

[01:00:40.340 --> 01:00:43.080]
The guy ain't like you and me

[01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:45.860]
He ain't got no dinky

[01:00:46.860 --> 01:00:49.460]
But I just cannot turn my head

[01:00:49.460 --> 01:00:51.960]
I really think he's gay

[01:00:52.860 --> 01:00:55.080]
Well my stomach turns

[01:00:58.100 --> 01:01:01.220]
He's a girl in men with a plastic nose

[01:01:01.220 --> 01:01:04.000]
Probably prancers round in a pantyhose

[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:05.440]
He's a weirdo

[01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:08.060]
He's a weirdo

[01:01:08.860 --> 01:01:11.240]
Well now be in dead hands

[01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:15.520]
So bad cause he won't ever get to call me dead

[01:01:18.020 --> 01:01:19.800]
He's a weirdo

[01:01:20.460 --> 01:01:22.980]
I'm kinda glad I died

[01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:24.420]
He's a weirdo

[01:01:24.420 --> 01:01:27.600]
You didn't die Elvis, we know you're in the federal witness protection program

[01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:29.900]
That's the whole thing about that plane and all that stuff

[01:01:29.900 --> 01:01:31.600]
And the Miami connection we know all about that

[01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:33.380]
How you doing Elvis? You're out there somewhere baby

[01:01:34.260 --> 01:01:36.280]
So anyway like I said at the beginning of the show

[01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:40.360]
If you got $40, $50 million to pay everybody off, keep everybody as mouth shut

[01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:42.940]
And all of a sudden their memory starts just failing real bad

[01:01:42.940 --> 01:01:43.880]
They get like lock jaw

[01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:45.120]
What are we with that's all about?

[01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:46.640]
Here's Kendall, hello

[01:01:47.420 --> 01:01:47.780]
Hello

[01:01:47.780 --> 01:01:48.420]
Yes sir

[01:01:48.420 --> 01:01:51.480]
Yeah, first of all I can't believe you keep up this pace five days a week

[01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:53.680]
I know it's frightening, isn't it? It's frantic, frenetic

[01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:56.440]
I don't think anybody realizes how hard it is what you do

[01:01:56.440 --> 01:01:58.640]
It is very hard in the show too

[01:01:58.640 --> 01:01:59.160]
And the show too

[01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:03.400]
If I just had a few more 13, 14 minute commercial breaks in between

[01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:04.880]
I can get like a second win you know

[01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:05.980]
I feel like I want you to do

[01:02:05.980 --> 01:02:06.560]
Yeah

[01:02:08.020 --> 01:02:09.060]
What if you could help me?

[01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:13.240]
I've been trying to give a donation to Camilla's house for three weeks

[01:02:13.240 --> 01:02:15.020]
I can't get return phone calls and all that

[01:02:15.020 --> 01:02:19.100]
Do you know anybody else that is working with a homeless that I could work with?

[01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:23.680]
The Miami Rescue Mission downtown which I don't have the number but that's one

[01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:24.900]
Daily bread food bank

[01:02:24.900 --> 01:02:27.180]
Daily bread food bank is a great, very good charity

[01:02:27.180 --> 01:02:28.600]
Daily bread food bank

[01:02:29.300 --> 01:02:31.480]
Which I'm sure if you call 411 I got the number

[01:02:32.020 --> 01:02:36.800]
Now with the Vietnam veterans we have money we want to give the name of a boy that died

[01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:38.400]
And he used to work at homeless

[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:43.840]
And the other thing was I sent some letters into your station from the Clark-Eck Club

[01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:47.100]
And wanted to do some work with the homeless

[01:02:47.100 --> 01:02:49.800]
Oh right yeah I got to talk to Steve Nichol back about that right

[01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:50.380]
Okay

[01:02:50.380 --> 01:02:51.160]
That's a good idea

[01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:52.620]
Alright, appreciate it

[01:02:52.620 --> 01:02:54.080]
So I'll just wait to hear from you

[01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:54.860]
We'll be back to you

[01:02:54.860 --> 01:02:55.740]
Okay thanks a lot

[01:02:55.740 --> 01:02:56.200]
Bye-bye

[01:02:56.580 --> 01:02:59.680]
Open line in day at 751 and one on a purple line pound IUD

[01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:03.080]
If you have said it to one that's the one line that just still a little on the anemic side

[01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:04.660]
Stick some iron in that baby man

[01:03:05.500 --> 01:03:06.460]
Stick with the iron

[01:03:06.460 --> 01:03:08.160]
Here's Miami hello

[01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:08.480]
Hello

[01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:09.080]
Yes sir

[01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:09.820]
Aineel how you doing?

[01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:10.240]
Great

[01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:17.320]
Hey have you heard about 80s one of their most prominent weapons against the US troops when they invaded

[01:03:18.180 --> 01:03:19.180]
That island down there?

[01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:20.200]
What was that jerk beef?

[01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:21.440]
No no no no this is here

[01:03:21.440 --> 01:03:22.960]
It's called Oliander powder

[01:03:23.580 --> 01:03:23.980]
Oliander

[01:03:23.980 --> 01:03:24.940]
Oliander powder

[01:03:24.940 --> 01:03:26.580]
Is that like Oliander New York?

[01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:26.900]
Yes

[01:03:26.900 --> 01:03:30.360]
Yeah what the stuff does is if anybody who breathes the stuff in

[01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:34.620]
It incapacitates them for 60 hours two and a half days

[01:03:34.620 --> 01:03:35.080]
Wow

[01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:36.940]
The US troops don't know about this stuff down there

[01:03:36.940 --> 01:03:37.760]
Oliander?

[01:03:38.140 --> 01:03:38.960]
Oliander powder

[01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:43.460]
Ask any Haitian voodoo priest and he will tell you it's true and they all believe it

[01:03:43.460 --> 01:03:44.440]
The voodoo priests?

[01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:48.820]
Any voodoo any person that's well versed in the voodoo religion

[01:03:48.820 --> 01:03:49.800]
Yeah I'm a lady

[01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:52.360]
They will tell you Oliander powders for real

[01:03:53.020 --> 01:03:56.000]
They will prove that that believe breathes this stuff

[01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:59.600]
It incapacitates them for 60 hours two and a half days

[01:03:59.600 --> 01:03:59.920]
Yeah

[01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:03.220]
And they'll do anything that the Haitians tell them to do

[01:04:03.220 --> 01:04:05.880]
And you know they want to use this

[01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:09.000]
Oh wait a minute so in other words it'll make somebody do anything you tell them to do

[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.880]
Basically it can't be incapacitated but they're kind of sad

[01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:14.460]
Well let's forget about the Haitians that where do we get some of this stuff

[01:04:14.460 --> 01:04:15.320]
We need it

[01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:18.280]
Because I can think of a lot of people I'd like to give just a little powder on that

[01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:19.460]
That would be beautiful

[01:04:19.460 --> 01:04:19.820]
Right

[01:04:19.820 --> 01:04:21.880]
Well do anything you want for two and a half days

[01:04:21.880 --> 01:04:22.580]
What's that?

[01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:25.520]
I see two and a half days sounds like a pretty interesting amount of time

[01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:26.340]
A lot of rest time

[01:04:26.340 --> 01:04:28.340]
You could accomplish your hell of a lot in that period of time

[01:04:28.340 --> 01:04:29.940]
I know but it's supposed to be for real

[01:04:29.940 --> 01:04:32.580]
I have a good source that told me about this stuff down there

[01:04:32.580 --> 01:04:36.460]
That this guy knows the stuff about the voodoo religion

[01:04:36.460 --> 01:04:39.620]
Well you better call up Jimmy Carter and tell him to watch this behind

[01:04:39.620 --> 01:04:40.240]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:04:40.580 --> 01:04:43.020]
Yeah and before I go up the line I want to call somebody a douspec

[01:04:43.020 --> 01:04:43.960]
Okay go ahead

[01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:45.700]
It's down to my, you're a douspec

[01:04:45.700 --> 01:04:45.960]
Oh!

[01:04:46.460 --> 01:04:47.560]
Okay see ya

[01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:48.460]
Take a bowler

[01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:50.780]
We have an open now like a BC powder

[01:04:50.780 --> 01:04:52.520]
See every time I think of that I think a redneck

[01:04:52.520 --> 01:04:53.100]
That's bad

[01:04:53.100 --> 01:04:55.560]
Why do I think a red because of their spots probably

[01:04:55.560 --> 01:04:58.680]
Their spots are always real Yahoo those BC powder

[01:04:58.680 --> 01:04:59.600]
Take a powder

[01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:02.020]
See there I go again with that thing about southerners

[01:05:02.020 --> 01:05:03.000]
And that deep southern accent

[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:06.120]
I always take a Yahoo I'm sure there's some very bright people from the deep south

[01:05:06.120 --> 01:05:09.680]
I haven't ever met any although Julian Bond and Barbara Jordan there we go again

[01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:12.560]
And anybody else we can take out who's from the deep south

[01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:15.140]
Who's really bright, articulate no?

[01:05:15.620 --> 01:05:17.200]
There must be one somewhere

[01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:19.860]
No we'll find one someplace

[01:05:19.860 --> 01:05:21.940]
I just don't come across him

[01:05:21.940 --> 01:05:23.680]
Here's Miramar hello

[01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:23.940]
Neil

[01:05:23.940 --> 01:05:24.600]
Yes sir

[01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:25.180]
How you doing?

[01:05:25.420 --> 01:05:25.680]
Great

[01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:27.640]
I have a print shop in Miramar

[01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:28.060]
Yes

[01:05:28.060 --> 01:05:31.340]
And we just finished printing 100,000 flyers

[01:05:31.340 --> 01:05:33.440]
Things to vote yes for gambling

[01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:34.320]
Oh!

[01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:35.140]
Beauty

[01:05:35.140 --> 01:05:38.940]
And we've been actually printed 20,000 before that

[01:05:38.940 --> 01:05:40.180]
And we've been passing them out on the weekends

[01:05:40.180 --> 01:05:43.260]
And we've got like a little newsletter on the bottom

[01:05:43.260 --> 01:05:46.180]
And a lot of the information that we've been putting on the flyer

[01:05:46.180 --> 01:05:49.360]
I've got a lot of ideas from when I saw you on the Kennel Toyota show

[01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:49.760]
Right

[01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:51.200]
And from this into your radio show

[01:05:51.860 --> 01:05:55.040]
And I want you to know that you know we're doing our part to

[01:05:55.040 --> 01:05:55.560]
Beautiful

[01:05:55.560 --> 01:05:57.800]
This is something that you're just doing on your own?

[01:05:57.920 --> 01:05:58.340]
On our own

[01:05:58.340 --> 01:05:59.040]
Great

[01:05:59.500 --> 01:05:59.860]
Outstanding

[01:05:59.860 --> 01:06:03.360]
Because I agree with every issue that you've sent so far about the gambling

[01:06:03.980 --> 01:06:04.640]
Every issue

[01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:05.580]
Gotta have it man

[01:06:05.580 --> 01:06:06.860]
Gotta have it it's our only hope

[01:06:06.860 --> 01:06:09.680]
It's the only light at the end of the long dark tunnel for this state

[01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:13.000]
Well I mean I like black checks so much that I wouldn't mind being at the you know

[01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:14.100]
Train to be a killer myself

[01:06:14.100 --> 01:06:16.500]
Yeah they're making a 55 grand a year to start

[01:06:16.500 --> 01:06:17.180]
Big buck

[01:06:17.180 --> 01:06:17.980]
Not bad

[01:06:18.560 --> 01:06:20.040]
Can I go somebody a douchebag?

[01:06:20.120 --> 01:06:20.460]
Go ahead

[01:06:20.460 --> 01:06:22.280]
I have to call a Victor Valdez

[01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:24.540]
A Bears watching douchebag

[01:06:24.540 --> 01:06:25.740]
Okay keep doing it baby

[01:06:25.740 --> 01:06:26.340]
You got it, bubba

[01:06:26.340 --> 01:06:26.800]
Thanks

[01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:29.600]
Okay so there's people out there that are like doing their thing

[01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:32.200]
And that's what we need because I don't care how many millions they spend

[01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:35.120]
You've got to take people out there and like knock some sense into them

[01:06:35.120 --> 01:06:36.000]
Whether they like it or not

[01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:37.180]
You follow?

[01:06:37.580 --> 01:06:39.520]
You've got to take the methods of the opposition

[01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:41.580]
And beat them over the head with a 2x4

[01:06:41.580 --> 01:06:43.420]
And knock some sense into that thick skull

[01:06:43.420 --> 01:06:45.920]
And I'll say hey this is what we got to have we're talking jobs we're talking money

[01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:49.180]
We're talking about big name entertainment we're talking about revitalizing this whole area

[01:06:49.180 --> 01:06:51.900]
Instead of letting most of the living tourists go up to Orlando

[01:06:51.900 --> 01:06:54.040]
Who the hell gives a flying crap about Orlando

[01:06:54.040 --> 01:06:57.020]
I mean I know we have some people who listen through all the static up there

[01:06:57.020 --> 01:06:59.400]
Like in Kassimi and those other Yahoo places

[01:06:59.400 --> 01:07:01.900]
Don't take it personal although it might be partially

[01:07:02.420 --> 01:07:04.120]
But we just need some stuff down here

[01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:06.860]
We need some action we need some living and breathing people and some money

[01:07:07.420 --> 01:07:10.360]
To pay for all this other crap that the government keeps inflicting on us

[01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:12.820]
Not to mention a place to go and have a good time

[01:07:12.820 --> 01:07:15.780]
Which I know is pretty revolutionary but we can't all fit into Kathy Willet's house

[01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:18.440]
146 is WIOD here

[01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:22.080]
This South Florida's news talk and entertainment station

[01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:26.420]
You stop radio six and acrabling

[01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:29.680]
WIOD

[01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:31.180]
I always Miguel

[01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:34.420]
I'm a Macita

[01:07:34.420 --> 01:07:36.420]
I I I

[01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:42.280]
Now functioned at the junction

[01:07:43.420 --> 01:07:45.620]
In other words crappy equipment

[01:08:06.420 --> 01:08:08.260]
We're sick of stupid shit

[01:08:08.260 --> 01:08:10.500]
I'm heaven news

[01:08:10.500 --> 01:08:15.400]
TV season looks fancy

[01:08:24.040 --> 01:08:25.660]
Dudley Moore

[01:08:26.420 --> 01:08:27.820]
Daddy Coleman

[01:08:28.420 --> 01:08:29.760]
Oh no

[01:08:30.420 --> 01:08:31.660]
There's last show's blue

[01:08:32.420 --> 01:08:35.400]
There's howl in the engine wild

[01:08:35.400 --> 01:08:37.600]
I miss the wilder they blow

[01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:41.200]
And Martin Schott's been dug up too

[01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:43.500]
Why didn't they retire?

[01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:45.040]
And they're all through

[01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:47.520]
And now I think we know

[01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:49.460]
Why this news

[01:08:49.460 --> 01:08:54.100]
TV season will be largely

[01:08:55.940 --> 01:08:57.280]
And she is

[01:08:57.280 --> 01:08:58.440]
Cardamon Amanda

[01:08:58.440 --> 01:08:59.440]
Now they're dead too

[01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:01.100]
Why did we detect it now?

[01:09:01.300 --> 01:09:02.880]
Wait, the Millicent Kilmer

[01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:04.300]
I'm so dead with jazz

[01:09:04.300 --> 01:09:05.600]
Oh my god, and dead

[01:09:06.160 --> 01:09:08.220]
Call recycling the same old tired crap

[01:09:08.220 --> 01:09:10.220]
Is what it's called because there's about as much creativity

[01:09:10.220 --> 01:09:13.080]
With those TV people as there is cash in my ass

[01:09:13.080 --> 01:09:13.720]
I'm sorry

[01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:15.500]
Oh quarter just fell out

[01:09:16.220 --> 01:09:17.780]
Let's go to Miami

[01:09:17.780 --> 01:09:18.440]
Hello

[01:09:18.960 --> 01:09:19.700]
Yes, Neil?

[01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:20.560]
Yes sir

[01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:21.860]
Yes, I was wondering

[01:09:21.860 --> 01:09:23.280]
There's a couple of things I want to attach to

[01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:26.140]
One of them is an observation I did on Sunday

[01:09:26.140 --> 01:09:27.180]
I was like channel surfing

[01:09:27.180 --> 01:09:29.940]
And I caught up with the sports rap show

[01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:31.220]
Mr. Mandage

[01:09:31.220 --> 01:09:33.300]
Mr. Mandage, you mean Sunday night?

[01:09:33.480 --> 01:09:34.260]
Yes, Sunday night

[01:09:34.260 --> 01:09:37.040]
And I was wondering how I mean see how much you like him

[01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:42.280]
So if you never really mentioned now he has a straggler resemblance to like a muppic from one of those old gimhencen shows

[01:09:42.280 --> 01:09:43.480]
You third

[01:09:43.940 --> 01:09:45.100]
Yeah, he really does

[01:09:45.880 --> 01:09:48.400]
Wait a minute, I don't like him on the air

[01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:49.960]
I don't like to be with him or see him

[01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:51.600]
I see him, I get physically ill

[01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:53.480]
I do like this work that he does on the air

[01:09:53.480 --> 01:09:56.340]
Because he's got a big mouth and he's like gets excited and enthusiastic

[01:09:56.340 --> 01:09:59.540]
And we especially need him on the dolphin broadcast to wake Bill's infrared

[01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:03.420]
And then the other thing I wanted to ask you was how was reading this?

[01:10:03.420 --> 01:10:05.420]
Oh, seriously, we need that enthusiasm as in

[01:10:05.420 --> 01:10:06.860]
Well, alright

[01:10:07.220 --> 01:10:08.320]
Of course, that is

[01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:09.220]
Where else can you get there?

[01:10:09.580 --> 01:10:11.340]
Yeah, that's true, that's definitely true

[01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:13.440]
And the other question I wanted to ask you was

[01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:15.360]
Yesterday I noticed I was listening to your show

[01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:19.740]
And you didn't mention too much what do you think would happen to blockbuster or Mr. Wayne

[01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:21.600]
Jump the boat

[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:24.420]
Oh, I don't think it's going to make any difference

[01:10:24.420 --> 01:10:27.100]
He's got all his little soldiers in place and you know, of course

[01:10:27.100 --> 01:10:31.040]
He'll on the one hand he'll say he's uninvolved, he'll step down, he won't have the title anymore

[01:10:31.040 --> 01:10:34.860]
But you know, it's just like with the heat, you know, on the heat he's on the outside, it's supposed to be his brother

[01:10:35.260 --> 01:10:37.920]
He's always got his finger in it, man, trust me when I tell you

[01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:41.780]
And you can feel it, you really, it's not a, it's not a suppositor that's Wayne's finger

[01:10:41.780 --> 01:10:45.520]
Yeah, it's just another way of him doing one of the little slimy, kind of things

[01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:48.340]
Exactly, slimy is the word, you got it to a team, man

[01:10:48.340 --> 01:10:50.480]
And one more thing, the wife would love

[01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:53.120]
I just, I can feel this coming, you know what I'm saying?

[01:10:53.760 --> 01:10:55.620]
And maybe she will too, hang on, Palley

[01:10:56.040 --> 01:10:57.480]
Okay, that's what he's hoping, I'm sure

[01:10:57.480 --> 01:11:00.180]
I had lined two for our Amigo, there are Paison

[01:11:00.740 --> 01:11:03.520]
Our Paison and a West Coast, he's taking care of this, I'm sorry

[01:11:04.660 --> 01:11:05.380]
Oh boy

[01:11:06.140 --> 01:11:09.740]
Just, well, they just a lot of stuff coming up, we got the gambling thing going like I said

[01:11:09.740 --> 01:11:12.620]
It's almost enough to get me excited about being here, not quite, but almost

[01:11:13.220 --> 01:11:14.780]
Here's Sunrise, hello?

[01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:15.440]
Nail

[01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:16.380]
Yes sir, it's going

[01:11:16.380 --> 01:11:17.040]
Great

[01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:23.640]
Hey, at BC, you know why that reminds you of, it stands for Brainless Cowpoke

[01:11:24.700 --> 01:11:26.620]
Cowpoke being the operative word there

[01:11:27.700 --> 01:11:29.500]
This populist part of you're talking about

[01:11:30.300 --> 01:11:34.420]
That's pretty brainless there, how popular is going to be with 35 people

[01:11:34.420 --> 01:11:38.380]
30, seven people and five of them were in the same house and now we're down to like 32

[01:11:39.060 --> 01:11:42.540]
And they all seem to be like in that Davy Hollywood borderline there

[01:11:42.540 --> 01:11:44.860]
You know where the cows are in the middle of the grazing road of the road

[01:11:44.860 --> 01:11:46.600]
They all seem to be hanging around by there with their horse

[01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:50.760]
Come get their fat ass off the couch and come in on the kitchen

[01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:53.920]
It gives them something to do, you know, it keeps them occupied, keeps them busy

[01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:58.280]
And of course when they're not so in up those sheets on the weekend, it's given them something else, a little hobby for them

[01:11:58.280 --> 01:12:01.920]
Right, I wish Howard could go to the tent of Tuesday, so I just so he could compete with you

[01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:05.080]
It wouldn't compete, but just so he could go down the toilet

[01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:09.620]
Well, he's doing his thing, after today I don't worry about Howard anymore

[01:12:09.620 --> 01:12:12.160]
Because like I said, I gave him a second chance today

[01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:15.080]
And I listened through all those spots and through a long ponderous bid

[01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:18.600]
And Stuttering John was very funny, Howard and Robin were less funny

[01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:22.060]
And it's just, it's not a big deal, it's just not going to change my life

[01:12:22.060 --> 01:12:23.940]
Howard you're a dirty ed

[01:12:23.940 --> 01:12:25.920]
Okay, Neil, yeah, can I get a CD?

[01:12:26.180 --> 01:12:27.820]
Hang on, okay

[01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:30.720]
He's on five

[01:12:31.740 --> 01:12:35.300]
See it's amazing how many gives something away, they all, hey you're the best man, can I get something?

[01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:37.840]
You're just, can I suck around a little bit and I'll give you something

[01:12:38.760 --> 01:12:39.920]
How about giving me something?
