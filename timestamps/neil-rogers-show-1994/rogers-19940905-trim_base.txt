A mobility customer can call star IOD at no charge.

[00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.580]
And cellular one customer can call pound IOD at no charge.

[00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.480]
The opinion is expressed by the host guests.

[00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.100]
The caller is not necessarily those of the station or sponsors.

[00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:37.020]

The lion has gone too far, he's even on.

[00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:51.800]

[00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.580]
I can't tell everything.

[00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.240]
He pushed me prior to further pain.

[00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.480]
The lion king is on everything.

[00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.140]
Call it Disney on the right.

[00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.560]
The sound is so, so, so, so, you're just lost.

[00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.120]
Just a proper sight of sight.

[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.440]
The robot don't have every justice even all I got.

[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.380]
It's just one part of the thing.

[00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:17.460]
You're due to safety.

[00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.840]

[00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.500]

[00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.240]
My empty pocket!

[00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.240]
It's my wallet's feeling light!

[00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.520]
The kids can't, they'll hug me.

[00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.120]
All I feel cr instrumental, they'll be boys tonight!

[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.640]

[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.980]

Clemie

[00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:50.300]
good morning

[00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:52.340]
four

[00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:02.120]
the sparks this harvest

[00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:06.940]
the chair

[00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:11.600]
to have your short leaf line.

[00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:16.200]
Yard days are done,

[00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:21.220]
and when they finally start to wrap you in.

[00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:25.680]
I'll pull the switch

[00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:30.420]
and proudly wave by by

[00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:34.280]
Oh, a nail!

[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:34.760]
No!

[00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:37.060]
Anyway, 1260 is W.I.D.

[00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:39.340]
I was thinking about playing something appropriate for Danny Boy,

[00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:40.840]
and I had a different Danny Boy in mind.

[00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:42.520]
They don't have anything for Danny Boy.

[00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:44.520]
So we had to do for Danny Rowling,

[00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:47.840]
but I guess you could say the only way that Marino could have gotten any hotter yesterday

[00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:49.980]
would have been if he was sitting in Danny's lap on the chair.

[00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:51.240]
That might be something.

[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:52.880]
Where is my Danny thing?

[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.120]
Okay, I did play it once today,

[00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:54.980]
but it's certainly worth it,

[00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:56.340]
and I wish it was a good one, but it's not.

[00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:57.420]
It's not.

[00:07:57.460 --> 00:07:59.880]
Then, Marino, where's the god?

[00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:00.820]
Oh!

[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.620]
Anyway, let's do a bokeh.

[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:06.000]
How come Palm Beach County is so goddamn active today?

[00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:07.100]
What happened? I'll just come back?

[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:08.520]
Boca, hello.

[00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:09.560]
Hello, Neil. How you doing?

[00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:11.280]
Pretty damn good. Happy Labor Day to you?

[00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:12.020]
Happy Annelier.

[00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:13.960]
Hey, listen, now welcome back.

[00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:14.200]
Happy Gupras.

[00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:15.500]
And welcome back from Italy.

[00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:17.560]
I bet the customs people, when you get off the plane,

[00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:18.680]
they go, hey, there's Neil Rogers.

[00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:20.280]
Yeah, they say, yeah, just go through.

[00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:21.380]
We know you are a fat slob.

[00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:23.180]
Just go through with all your pasta and get out of here.

[00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:25.380]
Hey, how's the food over there?

[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:25.680]
I believe.

[00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:27.280]
Oh, man, to die for.

[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:28.600]
When you get off the plane here,

[00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:30.500]
you just don't, you want to get right back on it, huh?

[00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:32.720]
Especially when you get off and you walk out in the back of your

[00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:33.160]
middity.

[00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:36.460]
Oh, my God, it's like, it's like you just, as soon as you get outside

[00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:41.080]
the door of the airport, you would start walking into a wall of scrap.

[00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:43.180]
Liquid, liquid, wet.

[00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:45.480]
In addition to which, let me say one more time,

[00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:46.900]
I know it's not going to have any impact.

[00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:50.980]
But all this crap, you know, they painted these little signs with the sun symbol

[00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:53.380]
and everything, so tourists don't get lost from my international.

[00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:55.700]
I've lived here for almost 20 years,

[00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:59.880]
and I still can't figure out how to get home from my international airport.

[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:02.360]
I know how to get there, but leave in there, man.

[00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:04.620]
It starts out with like five different things.

[00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:06.680]
If you want to go 836 west, you stay away.

[00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:09.580]
And then all of a sudden, the narrow is down to like three different directions.

[00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:12.740]
And some of the roads they were looking were they, they just disappeared like

[00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:14.160]
836 to the Palmetto.

[00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:15.340]
It don't exist anymore.

[00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:16.960]
I wonder if people are getting lost like crazy.

[00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:19.720]
And many of finally, so my only option at this point is to get out

[00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:22.320]
112 and go over to 95 and go up north to the turnpike.

[00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:23.580]
So I get on that thing.

[00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:26.800]
And just like the last time, the road branches in the three different roads

[00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:30.740]
and one is 95 south, another one is 95 north for Lauderdale,

[00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:31.960]
and another one is something else.

[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:35.220]
And when you get to the divisions there, it doesn't say which one is which.

[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:35.920]
Take your choice.

[00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:38.740]
Oh my God, this town is so inept that it's frightening.

[00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:39.580]
Amazing.

[00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:42.880]
Listen, I wanted to say about the casinos.

[00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:44.440]
We're talking a little bit about casinos today.

[00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:47.760]
And I was up in New Jersey for four weeks and I went down Atlantic City.

[00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:48.060]
Yeah.

[00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:52.620]
I know it's not Vegas, but I'll tell you what, the casinos were jammin'

[00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:55.940]
and there were so many jobs that were have been created up there.

[00:09:55.940 --> 00:10:00.320]
And it took me a half an hour to get on a blackjack table in any of the casinos.

[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:01.680]
I'm talking everyone.

[00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:03.180]
Trump's got three of them up there.

[00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:03.400]
Yeah.

[00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:05.020]
And it's just amazing.

[00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:08.720]
There's a lot of work and the worst type of crime is unorganized crime.

[00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:13.580]
I mean, if there's crime going on up there, you would never know it because there's plenty of security.

[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:16.160]
There's plenty of, it would help this town immensely.

[00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:17.940]
And I just, eventually, the problem is.

[00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:20.480]
You have to be an imbecile not to know that.

[00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:24.040]
And if it's a hell of a commentary, all you have to do is listen to the Phil Henry show

[00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.860]
and hear how many stupid people are out there.

[00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:29.800]
And they don't understand why we're still living in the dark ages in the state.

[00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:31.260]
It's just loaded with stupid people.

[00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:34.840]
That's right. And eventually the tide will turn and there'll be enough young people

[00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:39.680]
and people that will be a little more liberal and give it a chance because it's right around the corner in Louisiana.

[00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:44.320]
And who knows? Georgia will be next and we're going to be one of the only people that doesn't have it.

[00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:45.500]
Hoi! Yeah.

[00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:46.680]
Well, we'll get rid of this.

[00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:49.160]
As usual, we're always last with the least. That's us.

[00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:52.220]
And one other thing I was up in New York and let me tell you,

[00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:54.060]
I was listening to Howard for a couple of weeks.

[00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:57.900]
I couldn't wait to get back, man. I brought tapes of you up there and all my friends were into you.

[00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:00.500]
Your show is ten times better. His show was terminal.

[00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:04.120]
Well, since they gave him the operation and cut his balls off, he just don't have it anymore.

[00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:06.200]
Sadly. I mean, it was, it was sad a lot.

[00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.200]
I had to turn it off quite a few times.

[00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:11.240]
Okay, pal. Welcome back to a really depressing place.

[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:14.220]
And welcome back to you. And in closing to my roommate, Foti, Cian Maui.

[00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:15.480]
Okay. Bye-bye. See ya.

[00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:19.200]
Hoping on the agreement line. I think everybody is finally come back now.

[00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:24.480]
It's about time. All summer long, we've been sitting around here dying over here waiting for you people like Ross Perot says,

[00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:26.300]
it's you people. You're the problem.

[00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:29.560]
I'm talking, I still think that Wayne has in his Ross Perot with a different haircut.

[00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:36.020]
It's the same guy, same crappy attitude, same hostility, same little dictator, same Napoleonic complex.

[00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:40.360]
But thank God it was really his brother-in-law not Wayne at all to heat, right? Right.

[00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:42.400]
Just as Cian, he'll tell ya.

[00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:49.560]
The funny afternoon at W.Y.O.D., you walk on your floors all the time or maybe you like crawl around on your hands and knees on them.

[00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:53.320]
When you crack dirt on your toddler wood floor, it's just grab a broom and sweep it up.

[00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:55.420]
Is that what you do? Well, how about your carpeting?

[00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:57.680]
I don't think you can sweep that up with a broom can ya.

[00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:03.720]
You're gonna cheese on it and that's Italian and put on some checkered red and white tablecloths and that's Italian. Yeah, right.

[00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:05.400]
I got your Italian right over here, man.

[00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:09.800]
All these places that pretend to be Italian, they wouldn't know Italian food if you stuck it up their ass.

[00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:14.680]
In fact, some of their food tastes... Okay, let's go to Margate. Hello.

[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.240]
Hey, Neil. How you doing, sir?

[00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:21.460]
I'm a one-time listener, a long time caller. I moved the way about three years ago.

[00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:24.540]
Where did you go? Just out of DC in Virginia.

[00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:26.280]
Oh my God. Rest in Virginia.

[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:30.860]
And the last thing I did before I left was drop off pace for you as a prisoner.

[00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:32.960]
Oh yeah. A million years ago.

[00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:34.200]
How's Patrick been going to one?

[00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:36.620]
I saw him on the sci-fi channel up there.

[00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:40.400]
Yeah, they are running in. We have 120 channels.

[00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:43.100]
Well, I have like 300 and some because I have a settler.

[00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:44.540]
You are as additional. Yeah, correct.

[00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:49.080]
I just want to call them say hi. You are a breath of fresh air. I'm an issue sorely.

[00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:50.880]
I'm not a good two-sour.

[00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:56.620]
Well, I'm not an sci-fi Howard, but Don and Mike and G Gordon and all of them up there are three-leam.

[00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:04.780]
And all my friends are always telling me they send me tapes of you, Phil, Mark, all the guys I turned on to your show over the years still listening.

[00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:09.880]
I mean, Vinny of Bravo Pizza. I turned on to you when he became a sponsor at one point.

[00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:10.340]
Uh-huh.

[00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:13.900]
And I just want to say hi and how badly we miss you up north.

[00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:18.220]
And I hear everybody here is the same kitchen and moaning.

[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:19.320]
Same craft. That's it.

[00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:23.960]
It will never change. The humidity will never change. The altitude will never change.

[00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:28.040]
The age will never change. The paranoia and the repression will never change.

[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:29.520]
So we wanted to make you feel at home.

[00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:32.700]
I can't believe I almost had a while to pick up a flut, to go out to date.

[00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:35.760]
There you go. It is bad action. I was in AC last week.

[00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:41.080]
I picked up $400, 24 hours a day. Something's happening. Not here.

[00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:41.860]
Okay.

[00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:42.620]
Thank you.

[00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:44.800]
Welcome back. I'm glad to hear you're happy to be here.

[00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:46.040]
One more day.

[00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:46.760]
Yeah, okay.

[00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:47.320]
Bye-bye.

[00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:52.700]
We have an open line on the blue line, as in blue here, at 5249463.

[00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:56.380]
And one on the green line, which has been extremely active today, which is kind of surprising.

[00:13:57.020 --> 00:14:00.100]
All the yentos up there in Boka. They got the day off today. All the big shots.

[00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:02.360]
All the big plastic people in Boka.

[00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:05.120]
Boy, there's something stinks in here. I think it's me.

[00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:07.740]
You know how like when you have a cold, you smell real bad?

[00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:09.880]
No, it's not that cigar.

[00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:13.140]
Are you smoking a cigar in here? This is a Tutsi rule.

[00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:25.180]
That's what stinks. I'm sitting here and I'm thinking, God, I mean, I took a good shower.

[00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:30.980]
My clothes are clean. I'm doing my house meant to look at this because I got just a little bit of a cold, a little touch.

[00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:36.240]
But, and something stinks and I'm thinking it's me. You know, it's not me. It's you.

[00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:40.780]
It's coming through the events, man. It smells like toaches.

[00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:44.980]
God is at a crappy. He's smoking a cigar. I just want to put that on the record.

[00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:46.920]
Nice knowing you.

[00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:48.560]
Poor Waterdale. Hello.

[00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:50.520]
Hello.

[00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:51.380]
Hello.

[00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:52.060]
Yes, sir.

[00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:58.100]
I like to talk. I went out to fill up clients and there is no Luis out there.

[00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:00.480]
That lady, that lady who called a life.

[00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:03.460]
He said he's going to be there this weekend signing autographs.

[00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:04.800]
Oh, he ain't out there.

[00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:05.480]
Huh?

[00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:09.380]
He ain't out there. I don't know what's there. There isn't even any advertisement for it.

[00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:13.800]
Yeah, I think he's just a hallucinating. He probably had a fantasy dream over the weekend.

[00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:16.380]
Anyways, did you read the National Fire Lately?

[00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:16.920]
No.

[00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:18.860]
He got that pizza guy in there.

[00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:20.320]
What pizza guy's there?

[00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:22.080]
I bought a box of bulls.

[00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:25.220]
You know, Leroy always hit the inquire. I think that's a good place for it.

[00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:30.500]
Yeah, they made a full one to talk about them. But anyways, I just thought I'd let you know about that.

[00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:30.920]
Okay.

[00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:32.680]
All right. Let me know when Luis gets here.

[00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:36.140]
All right. Okay, see, we'll make sure to keep him away from you or the other way around.

[00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:38.900]
We have an open line on the blue line. 524, 1 on the green line.

[00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:44.900]
1-800. All you crazy people out there that want to go ahead and mob him, you know, and crawl and grab and me first.

[00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:50.100]
You know, don't go, don't go running out there and start acting like a fool if he shows up in town this weekend.

[00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:53.220]
Start licking, right? Get your tongue sharpened up, baby.

[00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:58.880]
He'll be here October 6th and 7th. That's for sure. This is no make-believe at the James Knight Center.

[00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:00.800]
Tickets at ticket mastery if there's any remaining.

[00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:05.940]
And if we ever get that package from all your good connections there, who haven't even sent me the new album.

[00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:11.160]
Is that embarrassing or what? I feel like, uh, loved like, you know, small potatoes.

[00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:12.880]
They might have, bro. We know.

[00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:16.960]
Yeah, they might have, but of course there's nobody around here because it's another four day busman's holiday here.

[00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:20.460]
I'm sure they all left it noon on Friday and there's not a dog in his joint today.

[00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:23.620]
And a copy, that, that, I'm serious.

[00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:27.880]
It's thank God we got a new program director in here who really made up his mind.

[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.780]
He put his nose to his ass of the grindstone. He said, we're going to solve this copy problem, the sales problem.

[00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:38.440]
I don't care what kind of a buck plug Jeff Clark is. We're going to really do it. And boy, he has really done it.

[00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:42.160]
Not, man, it's not getting better. It's getting worse.

[00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:45.740]
I mean, what kind of a piece of crap was that? Hello?

[00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:49.080]
I think I'll hold on. I'll hold on.

[00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:50.140]
Okay.

[00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:56.680]
I'd like to say that bitch that sent that card in that she don't listen to the station because there's only white people here.

[00:16:57.220 --> 00:17:00.980]
What the hell was that? How did she know she had the wrong number? I'd just barely said hello.

[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:06.180]
Oh, because I sounded white. That must have been a tip off. Here's North Miami. Hello?

[00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:09.060]
We're in the people. If you want to mess with Mandage.

[00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:11.720]
Dan Moreno. Dan.

[00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:17.600]
Let's go to Hollywood. Hello? Hollywood.

[00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:22.340]
There was a Hollywood I won before there wasn't there. And others are Hollywood I won again. That's still isn't there.

[00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:27.700]
We have an open line in day 751. One on the green line. Bokeh West Palm. Jupiter. Lantanel Lake.

[00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:31.820]
Worth it if you're under the age of 100. If you want to express yourself. If you want to speak your piece, baby.

[00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:35.840]
If you want to open your mouth up. If you've got some to say. Then call somebody else.

[00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:40.220]
What does that mean if that guy in Cooper City? Are you the fat guy?

[00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:41.580]
I am the fat guy. I know.

[00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:42.460]
Which fat guy?

[00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:45.720]
You fat guy. The old doesn't have the fat guy. It just became fat.

[00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:47.680]
What does that mean?

[00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:54.600]
Nothing. I'm a friend of jazz. And he did a hell of a job where you were giddily enjoying your shrimp.

[00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:55.160]
Campy?

[00:17:55.580 --> 00:17:57.920]
Yeah. I didn't have any shrimp scampy, but that's okay.

[00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:00.260]
Oh, let me tell you. I had a stand. I was on the other side.

[00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:03.360]
I had a small story for you. Years ago, I was tramping across Europe.

[00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:08.500]
I hooked up with my folks and were all, my dad is a shrimp scampy freak.

[00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:11.580]
I mean, the guy, you know, he salivates when he hears the word.

[00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:15.820]
Sit there, it says, where is a great restaurant? I said, well, there's one that I've been passing by lately.

[00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:18.960]
It's been looking good. My friends recommended let's go there.

[00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:22.160]
He orders a shrimp scampy when the waiter comes out with it.

[00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:25.220]
My dad almost passes out. I'm looking at him. What's the problem?

[00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:29.880]
It was the full shrimp. They were all lined up like little soldiers are staring at it.

[00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:33.940]
You had to pass it over to my mother. You couldn't eat it. They were staring at him. He was looking.

[00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:35.740]
He was looking. He freaked.

[00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:43.000]
Now, jazz is gone. Sounds like a real pussy to me. Oh, yeah, he is a pussy. Yeah. That's my dad. That's why he disowned me.

[00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:45.460]
Jazz is gone. Yeah. I'm with jazz.

[00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:52.940]
Hotsameth, Sanatova, Betzome, Cognil. Meaning what? Hotsameth has happy holiday in Hebrew. Oh.

[00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:59.680]

they were like real women playing them then it might be interesting I doubt it but it might be

[00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:03.120]
but when they got all these bull bikes out there like pretending to be women it's like watching

[00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:07.580]

[00:34:47.330 --> 00:34:51.190]
open line and brow are five to four yet they had a thing about like major markets I don't

[00:34:51.190 --> 00:34:55.150]
remember there this wasn't money but it was just before I went away the most desirable places

[00:34:55.150 --> 00:34:59.870]
and they rated like 15 different cities and Miami was number 15 huh why weren't doing it baby

[00:34:59.870 --> 00:35:04.490]
we have got it for you but we're still like 200 notches ahead of Buffalo guys got a good point

[00:35:05.250 --> 00:35:09.730]
and how about those bills yesterday oh man they must be sitting shivvy you know that house I always

[00:35:09.730 --> 00:35:14.190]
talk about two blocks from me where they have the big bills the the bills helmet on that stupid

[00:35:14.190 --> 00:35:19.150]
shed they've got up I mean we're talking about bills fans to the point of obnoxious they're obsessed

[00:35:19.150 --> 00:35:27.630]
with it and they must be just three points against the jets the boomer was in a coma during the

[00:35:27.630 --> 00:35:33.410]
entire preseason they were predicting like the disaster for the jets and right there in rich

[00:35:33.410 --> 00:35:39.770]
stadium in Buffalo in orchard park new york they get their ass kicked by the jets I love it

[00:35:39.770 --> 00:35:46.150]
I bet Jim Kelly's going to be spending all week paint and that ball spot north Miami Beach on

[00:35:46.150 --> 00:35:50.350]
the purple line hello I hate it on great I just you know you're talking about the satellite

[00:35:50.350 --> 00:35:56.550]
earlier in your show yeah I was very disappointed with the with the TVN the TV yesterday yeah

[00:35:57.250 --> 00:36:01.790]
it was like looking through a filter or something yeah yeah there was only I think that I don't

[00:36:01.790 --> 00:36:05.490]
remember the numbers but the coast Houston game that picture was crystal clear that was a good one

[00:36:05.490 --> 00:36:11.050]
was on it maybe six I think but most of the other eight channels the picture was it was like either

[00:36:11.050 --> 00:36:17.210]
mediocre or like eight the one I said before the the bears and bucks game that picture was awful

[00:36:17.210 --> 00:36:22.550]
yeah I very disappointed did you get the dolphin game on your thing no well I don't I don't know

[00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:27.850]
because I left you know I went to the game so you're blacked out supposedly well I registered my

[00:36:27.850 --> 00:36:33.730]
I registered my thing with a relative you registered your thing well the you know you have to

[00:36:33.730 --> 00:36:38.950]
register right you're you're you know yeah you're you yeah yeah but I came I got the dolphin

[00:36:38.950 --> 00:36:44.410]
interestingly enough you got it I yeah came in because I'm right it's in the name of a relative

[00:36:44.410 --> 00:36:48.570]
somewhere else because somebody before said they tried that and he didn't it didn't work yeah not

[00:36:48.570 --> 00:36:55.610]
only that but you could pick it up on wx ia the Atlanta NBC and bz also well that's it oh really

[00:36:55.610 --> 00:36:59.830]
yeah because bz is in Boston and they carried the Patriots yeah it's the only one I didn't try well

[00:36:59.830 --> 00:37:04.950]
obviously however bz is also losing in bc like very very soon I think in January

[00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:09.910]
although it'll be like the whole regular season will be on bz nobody won't be we won't be the

[00:37:09.910 --> 00:37:14.910]
Patriots won't be playing here again so it's meaningless now well I don't I guess it's worth it

[00:37:14.910 --> 00:37:19.970]
but I was very just my last year when it was everything was on the on k2 the pictures like you say

[00:37:19.970 --> 00:37:24.490]
well you know when everything was in a clear when the nsc used to be on mostly on t1 and then you

[00:37:24.490 --> 00:37:28.710]
have to fish around for a couple of them right and all the ns the a fc games like you say it'd be

[00:37:28.710 --> 00:37:34.190]
on k2 on a kuban and the picture was just outstanding I mean clear as a bill and now they're trying to

[00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:38.070]
you know because they've tenneled us all our suckers and they held us up for the money oh it's great

[00:37:38.070 --> 00:37:42.310]
because it's all on one satellite you can just in shulas even doing these spots you probably saw

[00:37:42.310 --> 00:37:46.190]
them yesterday and you can zip up and down and watch all the well it used to be that way anyway

[00:37:46.190 --> 00:37:49.930]
they were on two different satellites and you could watch all the games you didn't have to pay for

[00:37:49.930 --> 00:37:53.610]
and the word they you know and there was no blackouts yeah this is like this is almost the

[00:37:53.610 --> 00:37:57.610]
waste of i'm not sure that there's you can get them probably can fish around get a lot of the game

[00:37:57.610 --> 00:38:03.130]
just uh i've watched most of the city uh city uh stations yeah well i think i got it for 79 bucks

[00:38:03.130 --> 00:38:07.150]
because i got it when i was renewing showtime and movie channels part of a package but even you know

[00:38:07.150 --> 00:38:11.410]
it's not the price it bothers me so much but like you said the fact that the picture quality is so

[00:38:11.410 --> 00:38:15.670]
many ochre and they put it on a satellite that's old and crappy i mean who who wants to pay for that

[00:38:15.670 --> 00:38:20.290]
absolutely i i i would say more to get the kind of picture we had last year right that was

[00:38:20.290 --> 00:38:24.750]
ridiculous i'd pay double if they would just get Terry Bradshaw for there okay pal good luck to us

[00:38:24.750 --> 00:38:28.430]
say you like it yeah it is another example of the way they fleece the consumer and it you know

[00:38:28.430 --> 00:38:32.810]
comes back to the same thing again baseball around strike the seasons as good as over forget about it

[00:38:32.810 --> 00:38:37.430]
uh you know football they got deon running around he wants 30 made any one system hockey were like

[00:38:37.430 --> 00:38:40.390]
peeing in our pants are they're gonna have the season and then now the thing i'm telling the

[00:38:40.470 --> 00:38:46.730]

[00:42:21.930 --> 00:42:26.630]
marginal people but every time there's like a golf tournament something really boring going on

[00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:31.110]
or tennis and it's a holiday instead of seeing the regular programs that you expect to see

[00:42:31.110 --> 00:42:39.110]
you can always depend on cbs to have this swill on there 44 42 a 42 for some western on 44

[00:43:20.350 --> 00:43:27.110]
that down 415 and those blade section yeah anybody's out there that says that Danny is finished

[00:43:27.730 --> 00:43:33.390]
like like Bob Rubin for example yeah we need to hear a brain transplant yeah yeah I was

[00:43:33.390 --> 00:43:39.470]
pathetic anybody that says Bernie Kosar is an ample replacement and Danny is through anybody that

[00:43:39.470 --> 00:43:44.410]
would write a column like that I have to wonder if they're like need a lobotomy or something exactly

[00:43:44.410 --> 00:43:48.870]
get a search party you see if there's any evidence of a television left there yeah he's finished

[00:43:48.870 --> 00:43:55.010]
all right he's yeah right 76 yeah right the greatest the greatest game in the history of the NFL

[00:43:55.010 --> 00:44:00.110]
the greatest the greatest one man performance I mean let's face it the wingland played their

[00:44:00.110 --> 00:44:05.010]
brains out and blood so just picked our secondary apart like they were on a field and we just

[00:44:05.010 --> 00:44:09.650]
kept coming back and coming back and Danny just kept firing these incredible I mean just

[00:44:09.650 --> 00:44:15.450]
bullets down feel the fire and the angry one was just a miraculous thing yeah yeah I'll tell you

[00:44:15.450 --> 00:44:21.590]
I I locked out into this game I haven't been to a game that was 11 years old I really can't afford it

[00:44:21.590 --> 00:44:27.410]
yeah but I love one of my buddy said he was going to take me to a game and he asked me which game

[00:44:27.410 --> 00:44:33.730]
because he's in pick a good choice man and he told me I said new England Buffalo or the Jets yeah

[00:44:34.210 --> 00:44:39.130]
and he took me to this one and I you know we're going to have a barbecue right before the game

[00:44:39.130 --> 00:44:45.510]
and you know how that went yeah yeah yeah but you notice I kept saying everybody I said I think

[00:44:45.510 --> 00:44:51.230]
this is an omen because it poured like hell and it stopped just before the game started and then

[00:44:51.230 --> 00:44:54.850]
as we left we left with about a minute and some left in the game and you know was in the bag

[00:44:54.850 --> 00:45:00.750]
right and just as we got on the turnpike it started coming down again so once the game ended

[00:45:00.750 --> 00:45:04.110]
so in other words it was like the heavens were looking down on the dolphins and we

[00:45:04.110 --> 00:45:08.070]
we ended in there and Danny made his comeback and it was a great thing hey you know and we

[00:45:08.070 --> 00:45:13.510]
like to winning the god then super boy and just a guy and you know we had a guy one of them

[00:45:13.510 --> 00:45:19.570]
one of them jerks that's in the stands yeah they're just a drunk moron and he's back there and he

[00:52:36.750 --> 00:52:42.370]
smelly bitch oh man I'll say how come your college is that because well we act up a smelly bitch

[00:52:42.370 --> 00:52:50.850]
sit next to us yesterday really but they smell good okay all right Jim Adams you're a huge

[00:52:50.850 --> 00:52:56.030]
bag good luck you found okay so he was like uh enjoying the aroma of the uh contest yesterday

[00:52:56.030 --> 00:53:00.430]
in a game as well we have and what's wrong with male cheerleaders huh if they put some good ones

[00:53:00.430 --> 00:53:04.770]
out there I think I did see one I'm not sure they're so far away you know you need to be a little

[00:53:04.770 --> 00:53:08.730]
bit closer maybe that was Eddie from the UM swim team number Eddie from the UM swim team

[00:53:09.490 --> 00:53:13.010]
that did the Marlon's thing the first gamer to before they got embarrassed out of it because

[00:53:13.010 --> 00:53:17.430]
of a soldier see that's the thing I love about this whole Wayne business is he keeps doing all

[00:53:17.430 --> 00:53:23.530]
this silly crappy stuff and people are like what are you doing man they're like gagging there's this

[00:53:24.010 --> 00:53:27.550]
and then he gets embarrassed out of doing it was like the hokey pokey at the Marlon game remember

[00:53:27.550 --> 00:53:32.690]
that and they did that for like one or two games and everybody said get serious this is so freaking

[00:53:32.690 --> 00:53:38.670]
humidile and they quit doing the hokey pokey and by the way the best thing this is why we won the

[00:53:38.670 --> 00:53:44.670]
game yesterday two reasons number one never at any time during the game did anybody start that juvenile

[00:53:44.670 --> 00:53:50.370]
wave okay never did anybody do the wave and number two and I think there's a direct connection guess

[00:53:50.370 --> 00:53:54.930]
who we never saw he was down there because I saw him sulking around in the corner now that he's

[00:53:54.930 --> 00:54:01.170]
been like relegated like the backer doll fan denny he was just touting just kind of like uh you

[00:54:01.650 --> 00:54:05.690]
bouncing around in the background they're pounding nobody paid any attention to him I say how

[00:54:05.690 --> 00:54:12.030]
will you that's why we won the game I could be wrong it's 123 at wio d as you know Charles

[00:54:12.030 --> 00:54:16.370]
Alfie Erie's been supplying hair replacement systems for leading showbiz people for over 25

[00:54:16.370 --> 00:54:21.130]
years why because they know that Charlie knows his hair baby he knows the inside the outside and

[00:54:21.130 --> 00:54:25.230]
what's in between now you can pay more for hair system you can go to the hair club for boys men

[00:54:25.230 --> 00:54:30.070]
girls and in between whatever the hell they call it paying as much as 20 hundred bucks for some hair

[00:54:30.570 --> 00:54:34.510]
you can get the best looking and the most natural looking system available anywhere in the world

[00:54:34.510 --> 00:54:38.730]

[00:54:38.730 --> 00:54:43.950]
looking system is regular servicing man that's what life is all about is regular servicing and

[00:54:43.950 --> 00:54:48.590]
that's why service visits to Charles Alfie Erie studios are priced it's just 25 bucks not 60 bucks

[00:54:48.590 --> 00:54:53.370]
like a hair club just imagine getting service for 25 bucks and while you wait Charlie will add

[00:54:53.370 --> 00:54:57.570]

[00:58:50.950 --> 00:58:58.990]
deal hello oh me oh yes me oh yeah that game yesterday yes true classic game for the ages one of

[00:58:58.990 --> 00:59:04.430]
the greatest games in the history of professional sports if I dare say that myself and even listening

[00:59:04.430 --> 00:59:11.050]
to on the radio on that land mediocre broadcast that's really bad it still came through the excitement

[00:59:11.050 --> 00:59:17.630]
of the game he blasted through did it that's only cause of manage yeah management the crowd it's

[00:59:17.630 --> 00:59:23.270]
exactly right not because it's in for yeah let me ask you about it all Reno slugging in the

[00:59:23.270 --> 00:59:30.350]
mud back to pass he throws down field has that open marketing from hasn't a 30 he's to the 20 10 he is on oh

[00:59:30.350 --> 00:59:44.250]
guys yes yeah the marino is back baby and he rifles up pull it down there and mark England trails

[00:59:44.250 --> 00:59:51.830]
that football yeah that is weak you jackass incredible yeah they could maintain some of the

[00:59:51.830 --> 00:59:57.110]
intensity during the game yeah yeah anyone asked about Italy when you went over there did you

[00:59:57.110 --> 01:00:00.850]
did you get out of Rome or were you in Rome the whole time did I get out of Rome yeah out of the

[01:00:00.850 --> 01:00:06.550]
city eventually yeah no I was in Milan for a couple days and I was in Rome for a few days right

[01:00:06.550 --> 01:00:11.490]
I was roaming around yeah now if I was out there right anyway anybody anybody who says that Milan

[01:00:11.490 --> 01:00:16.450]
is like New York City you know let me just say it's something sure if you ever plan on going

[01:00:16.450 --> 01:00:20.710]
somewhere you know where it sounds like you might be interested in going just go and find out for

[01:00:20.710 --> 01:00:25.750]
yourself because if you listen to other people they tell you such fantastic tales anybody who

[01:00:25.750 --> 01:00:31.250]
could compare Milan to New York is in a dream world you know they got a few tall buildings there

[01:00:31.250 --> 01:00:36.370]
like maybe five or six you know fairly big buildings and other than that Milan is about as sterile

[01:00:36.370 --> 01:00:43.130]
as the inside of a band-aid box I mean Milan is is meaningless it's nothing it's a big financial

[01:00:43.130 --> 01:00:48.030]
city yeah I mean there is nothing it's clean the streets are clean and but there is nothing there

[01:00:48.030 --> 01:00:52.090]
and the food is nothing like in the Rome it's like northern Italian where they use a lot of butter

[01:00:52.090 --> 01:00:57.330]
and a lot of fatty stuff and a lot of rice and this crap where how anybody can go to Milan and tell

[01:00:57.330 --> 01:01:02.450]
you oh it's like it's just like a big New York with the what is that they're crazy now I was over

[01:01:02.450 --> 01:01:06.810]
there I was over there for two weeks in early August I took over eight hours of Neil tape but

[01:01:06.810 --> 01:01:12.210]
you know why would you go to Rome in Italy in August because that was when I got my vacation well

[01:01:12.210 --> 01:01:17.010]
where were you I was in the I was in the east of that I was in around Florence ombria and where there

[01:01:17.010 --> 01:01:22.130]
were people there a church yeah yeah because a lot of places like in Rome and in Milan in the first

[01:01:22.130 --> 01:01:26.770]
three three and a half weeks of August the the towns they're deserted everybody goes on vacation the

[01:01:26.770 --> 01:01:30.930]
restaurants close up there's nobody there but when you get into the real little town I was driving in a

[01:01:30.930 --> 01:01:35.730]
car and I just drove all over all the little towns all those all the places are open to go run by family

[01:01:35.730 --> 01:01:40.430]
though yeah the other people just don't take vacations basically those great two just fabulous

[01:01:40.430 --> 01:01:44.510]
we yeah Italy is the greatest place on the face of the year oh and the people look and then the

about circumcision it was actually a letter to the editor from USA today well I was away from a

[01:11:41.990 --> 01:11:48.070]
Jewish guy a Jewish therapist of some kind in in Boston you will just freak Georgia like it because

the guy is saying like circumcision is barbarian it makes and the guy is Jewish right well wrong he

[01:12:02.110 --> 01:12:06.470]
believe me just having come back from Italy if there's anybody who knows that we need more circumcision

[01:12:06.470 --> 01:12:12.270]
in this world I know it trust me you talk about foreskin okay let's go to a Fort Lauderdale hello

[01:12:12.270 --> 01:12:17.690]
you know how are you great listen I I bought the Sunday ticket you know bell Sunday ticket right

[01:12:17.690 --> 01:12:22.930]

[01:12:22.930 --> 01:12:27.530]
credit card number no problems no problems at all you got the game yeah absolutely that's too

[01:12:27.530 --> 01:12:32.790]
well the only problem and nobody told you yet is that yesterday they were showing it on transponder

[01:12:32.790 --> 01:12:37.850]
four the dolphin game that's where the Indianapolis game was in the Indianapolis game was like 10

[01:12:37.850 --> 01:12:42.810]
minutes over oh I see so guess what you don't see the first 10 minutes yeah but you didn't miss anything

[01:12:43.330 --> 01:12:47.230]
yeah yeah you missed the first 10 minutes the game yeah but you didn't miss anything for us we

[01:12:47.230 --> 01:12:53.090]
didn't score until I come into the house yeah but we could have yeah that's the whole point believe me

[01:12:53.090 --> 01:12:57.610]
believe me be happy you missed the first 10 minutes trust me yeah we were pretty we were

[01:12:57.610 --> 01:13:03.430]
impotent man we were weak but anyway Todd Christiansen and some other guy called the game yeah and

[01:13:03.430 --> 01:13:08.210]
you know the first touchdown were Merino through a Jackson yeah and then he points over to sideline yeah

[01:13:09.170 --> 01:13:12.910]
Christiansen saying that he's banking them for the call and we find out today in the paper that

[01:13:12.910 --> 01:13:17.790]
Merino called that yeah probably pointing at Gary Steven saying you asked exactly and probably

[01:13:17.790 --> 01:13:22.050]
Merino went over to sideline and suggested the fleece liquor and we know that Merino was the one

[01:13:22.050 --> 01:13:27.350]
who like gave the eye to to a fire on it in fact I read about it in the paper this morning about how

[01:13:27.350 --> 01:13:32.370]
he was wide open and he was the one I called it the winning touchdown exactly and so you know Gary

[01:13:32.370 --> 01:13:36.970]
I'm gonna tell you something seriously as much as I'm euphoric about the win yesterday as long as

[01:13:36.970 --> 01:13:42.850]
Gary Stevens and the time out of a Dottie are the assistant coaches on his team were in big trouble

[01:13:42.850 --> 01:13:47.830]
man I don't care what anybody says they see what is the love affair with all of a Dottie well see that

[01:13:47.830 --> 01:13:52.450]
that goes back to Shula again and I again I know everybody's very thrilled that we pulled the game out

[01:13:52.450 --> 01:13:56.670]
but it was Danny yesterday if Danny would have gotten injured if he wouldn't have been on the

[01:13:56.670 --> 01:14:01.290]
these sharpest day of his life we would have gotten beat yesterday so I'm tired of hearing a

[01:14:01.290 --> 01:14:05.590]
Shula starting to remind me of Tom Landry man he's like you know he was a great coach but you

[01:14:05.590 --> 01:14:10.090]
can't keep saying that forever sooner or later things start passing you by what do you think the

[01:14:10.090 --> 01:14:15.330]
final score would have been if coach are had been the starter of the player yesterday probably a new England 73

[01:14:18.210 --> 01:14:22.910]
and I'm back to you I know I see I'm peeing on their parade now because they want to get all

[01:14:22.910 --> 01:14:28.230]
it all super bowl well I don't I'm sorry I don't see no ingredients in here I see maybe toilet bowl

[01:14:28.230 --> 01:14:32.890]
not super bowl is Danny going to play it like that every week I don't think so even as great as he

[01:14:32.890 --> 01:14:37.130]
is there ain't nobody in the world who can play like that every week and if you don't have a

[01:14:37.130 --> 01:14:41.610]
if you don't you don't have a pass rush and your secondary can't stop anybody to begin with I

[01:14:41.610 --> 01:14:44.990]
mean see that just puts all the more pressure on the secondary when a quarterback's got enough time

[01:14:44.990 --> 01:14:49.910]
to write a letter home to grandma and there's no pass rush once or was standing back there like a statue

[01:14:49.910 --> 01:14:54.490]
yesterday hey how you doing over there he was like waving to parcels looking up at friends in the

[01:14:54.490 --> 01:14:58.290]
crowd oh by the way here's a guy who's so wide open I don't want to go into it it's just annoying

[01:14:59.130 --> 01:15:03.650]
plus the fact that markings is like got screwed real bad and if this team thinks that we don't

[01:15:03.650 --> 01:15:08.650]
need markings I mean in fact finally they put spikes in in the backfield like in the third quarter

[01:15:08.650 --> 01:15:14.370]
late in the third quarter and fat Richard and screaming please put try give him a chance put him in

[01:15:14.370 --> 01:15:18.070]
again and the first time we were like at about the new in the 20 you got about a six yard

[01:15:18.070 --> 01:15:22.410]
work again on the first carry I think he carried it again for another couple of yards and the crowd

[01:15:22.410 --> 01:15:27.690]
was screaming like the Messiah had just come that's how bad our running game is you can't

[01:15:27.690 --> 01:15:33.150]
complain about our running game because we don't have any so let's not get carried away in the euphoria

[01:19:40.300 --> 01:19:46.140]
he's up there just uh doing it here's pompo hello i'm sure he thought he was going to get on the

[01:19:46.140 --> 01:19:50.440]
air with no question about it you know i was going to call you and tell you the same thing the guy

[01:19:50.440 --> 01:19:56.500]
did a little earlier about the satellite disituation yeah and i guess you already know now so

[01:19:56.500 --> 01:19:59.840]
well i had the first uh you know the first guy to call about it this morning i would have

[01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:03.040]
been able to know how to lie well enough or maybe you give it a dress like in west palm

[01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:06.680]
beat your you know some stupid thing like that but it just makes sense if they're doing it by

[01:20:06.680 --> 01:20:12.040]
zip code and you give uh somebody's out of state zip code then you're going to get the game exactly

[01:20:12.040 --> 01:20:16.420]
right and i have the same problem that he had i mean the game didn't start until after like 20

[01:20:16.420 --> 01:20:20.060]
up to four because the first games went on till after four o'clock right now let me ask you this

[01:20:20.060 --> 01:20:24.000]
question because i discussed this with you know three or four other people and a you know now

[01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:28.840]
maybe it's i have a pretty bad bit of good uh you know a general instruments at 2750 good

[01:20:28.840 --> 01:20:33.960]
receiver a good system but the picture on t3 left a lot to be desired i thought and especially

[01:20:33.960 --> 01:20:39.760]
had a couple of the transponders like the like t3 8 with the uh bearers the buckskin it's fun i'm glad

[01:20:39.760 --> 01:20:44.380]
you said that because i thought it might have been my no now the picture was really marginal i there

[01:20:44.380 --> 01:20:48.700]
were a couple of them that were clear like it should be and i like used to be on t1 and keu but man

[01:20:48.700 --> 01:20:53.480]
it was some of them that were pretty marginal and eight uh was really bad yeah the dolphin game was

[01:20:53.480 --> 01:20:57.860]
perfect yeah thank god i have any problem that's what you need to see no but seriously don't you think

[01:20:57.860 --> 01:21:02.000]
when you're paying extra for that they should at least at least uh put it on a satellite where the

[01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:06.960]
picture is clear yeah that's one of the oldest satellites up right it sucks hey now when you buy

[01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:12.260]
that sunday ticket deal what if does that include the sunday night game in the monday night game no

[01:21:12.760 --> 01:21:18.440]
you have no course not is that a separate deal or a separate deal because that's abc and tnt

[01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:24.040]
and the spca and espn all our stuff and the last night i turned on tnd just for the hell of it

[01:21:24.040 --> 01:21:30.440]
that was there yeah i had a little up on the screen a little uh blurb there whatever that says

[01:21:30.440 --> 01:21:37.060]
if he buy this sunday ticket for $135 you get the game yeah where where where was it but that

[01:21:37.060 --> 01:21:42.200]
was on tnd so that's why i couldn't understand it if it was two separate deals or what

[01:21:42.200 --> 01:21:48.500]
yeah but was it was the give my question is was the game on t3 no no i had a turn to tnd

[01:21:49.220 --> 01:21:55.200]
i don't i don't understand well do you subscribe to tnt no and it came in no oh there was

[01:21:55.200 --> 01:21:59.840]
you know how you should tell the young man deal there is a hell of a lie a lot yeah i think all

[01:21:59.840 --> 01:22:04.400]
you get is the fox and the nbc i think that's that's it i could be wrong but uh i guess we'll find

[01:22:04.400 --> 01:22:08.400]
out tonight with the monday night not that not you know not that you need to go there to find it but

[01:22:08.400 --> 01:22:12.340]
it'll be interesting to see if it's there yeah i guess it will i'm going to check anyway i'm

[01:22:12.340 --> 01:22:17.660]
i had a feeling that might work by giving the out of state that and i tried it anyway it worked

[01:22:17.660 --> 01:22:21.840]
okay excellent okay scroll one for the small guys that's right i mean what about the bars

[01:22:22.380 --> 01:22:28.120]
come bars get the game the local game are you kidding me the bars have to pay like through the

[01:22:28.120 --> 01:22:33.020]
nose just to carry the out of town game they have to pay a fortune yeah but you know that those

[01:22:33.020 --> 01:22:37.280]
