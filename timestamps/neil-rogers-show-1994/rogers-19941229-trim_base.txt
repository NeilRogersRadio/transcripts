[00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.820]
Nice go Jennifer, speed it up, Fanzo or lose it forever, Pally.

[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:14.260]

Now, here's Neil Rogers, on News talk at Entertainment Radio, 610 WIOD.

[00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.540]
Hey Neil, f**k you.

[00:00:53.740 --> 00:01:02.780]
Yeah, you who party so must take it slow.

[00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.540]
Protect your insides.

[00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:18.570]
I don't say with even stills or grandmas or even Neil young.

[00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.890]
Shrees your liver well.

[00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.910]
Don't drink like hell.

[00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.330]
It'll surely go bad.

[00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:35.930]
Oh, please, just keep it clean.

[00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.190]
It can't be fixed.

[00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.370]
You'll need a donor.

[00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.310]
Don't you ever party hard.

[00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:57.030]
If you do, you could die or just wait in a long line.

[00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.210]
Like a David Crosby.

[00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04.990]
So who's liver would you rather have David Crosby or Bing?

[00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:06.890]
1207 at WIOD.

[00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:08.270]
How about some Bing cherries would be good.

[00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:11.310]
We have an open line in Broward 524 and I just have here in my hand.

[00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.950]
Did you see this?

[00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.410]
From this week's excess December 27th, this is a shocker maybe.

[00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.170]
We better get some music for this.

[00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.870]
From excess magazine, they have voted their villain of the year.

[00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.050]
And I'll give you 85 guesses who it is.

[00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.010]
And the first 84 and a half don't count.

[00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.690]
Villain of the year, H. Wayne Huzinghi.

[00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.710]
Suck it in and hold it.

[00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.430]
Getting the facts straight on the Huzinghi myth it's it.

[00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:37.290]
And what a great timing.

[00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:38.730]
What they felt it was a bucket of crap.

[00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.410]
Because this is on a day that the announcement about the scam

[00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.550]
with the parking things and the orange passes at the game.

[00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:44.370]
It's your Robbie Stadium.

[00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.250]
It says the owned by David Villano.

[00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.610]
Isn't that the guy that I spoke to that tried interviewing before?

[00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:52.810]
And they practically threatened his life.

[00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:53.710]
I do believe so.

[00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.630]
And I was going David, you got a big beer.

[00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.630]
Released used to.

[00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.050]
The Miami Dolphins first regular season football game this year took place

[00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:02.710]
on a cool, but evening early September.

[00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.550]
Heavy rains mixed with a red clay of the infield used by the Florida Marlins baseball team.

[00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.450]
Turning much of the playing service into a thick muddy stew.

[00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.890]
Players lost their footing and both teams uniformed it up to the grubby, burnt orange hue.

[00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.750]
Oh I like that the Anamata Pauya.

[00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:23.630]
The game at times was just a messy, a veritable highlight reel of football follies.

[00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.730]
From the press box above Joe Robbie Stadium, WIOD Radio Color commentator Jim Mandage,

[00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.930]
himself and former Dolphin, criticized the poor playing conditions.

[00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.750]
In a moment of frustration, managed, blamed the Marlins executive management

[00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.850]
for refusing to allow the clay to be removed despite the lingering baseball strike.

[00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.990]
Moments later during a commercial intermission, the door to the broadcast booth blew open.

[00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:49.310]
In walked H Wayne Huzinghi and I'm, what does it say?

[00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.470]
I'm nip a dent owner of the Dolphins, Marlins and Joe Robbie Stadium.

[00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.730]
Mandage spun around and met Huzinghi's cold stare.

[00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:59.290]
He didn't have time to greet the visitor with one of his form warm greetings like

[00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:00.230]
you check ass.

[00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:04.670]
Get your F in fact straight Huzinghi barked at Mandage piercing the air with his finger.

[00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:09.330]
It was the Fing football people, not the baseball people who made the decision to leave the clay.

[00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.890]
Witnesses it says were left dumb founded.

[00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:14.650]
How do you like this?

[00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:19.170]
Although the broadcasters were hardly shocked by the use of the F word,

[00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:25.490]
some observers were struck by the point in irony of Huzinghi's violent dictum to get the facts straight.

[00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:27.250]
Did that say dictum?

[00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:30.690]
And you're killed.

[00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.310]
No, I knew you were going to say that, that's bad.

[00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:34.290]
You turd.

[00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.770]
All right.

[00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:39.970]
That is beautiful.

[00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:44.890]
Anyway, it says former subordinates say they've been fired for the innocuous crime of speaking to the press.

[00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.290]
This is a man who enforces a company wide gag order to well employees.

[00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:50.690]
The man routinely ignores interview requests.

[00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.510]
He's been accused of rudely side stepping his involvement in dubious business affairs

[00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:58.710]
and his PR men have been known to harass journalists for probing too deeply into his background.

[00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:02.130]
The facts it seems are the last thing Huzinghi will want the pubic to know.

[00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:08.610]
Throughout 1994, excessively reported regularly on both Huzinghi's high profile activities,

[00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:10.890]
as well as his behind the scenes deal making.

[00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:15.510]
We reported on blockbuster successful efforts to force a pizza shop owner to change its name.

[00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:19.370]
We told you about his involvement in a project developed by a downtown public park,

[00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:21.910]
despite widespread public opposition,

[00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:26.530]
and we explained the mounting environmental concerns posed by the blockbuster park entertainment complex.

[00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.610]
But when we learned of Huzinghi's press box diet,

[00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:33.110]
the inquiring minds at excess took his challenge to the heart.

[00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:35.570]
To satisfy our reader's curiosity,

[00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:39.350]
we thoroughly examined Huzinghi's past both personal and professionally,

[00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:43.230]
and throughout our investigations, we did our darnedistic and our effing facts straight.

[00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:45.910]
Without his cooperation, there was no simple task,

[00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:48.150]
but we persevered confident of our findings.

[00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:49.570]
We were left with one conclusion.

[00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:53.270]
H. Wayne Huzinghi, the man who would be King of South Florida,

[00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:58.090]
is the clear choice for excess magazines 1994 villain of the year.

[00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:59.250]
Oh, I love it.

[00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:00.990]
So pick up the excess.

[00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:02.270]
The whole, it's a big, good thing.

[00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:04.230]
The Gonsa, the Gonsa spieler.

[00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:05.810]
Beautiful, nice going, Wayne, baby.

[00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:07.990]
And how about a free orange parking pass?

[00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:12.110]
So come on, who wants those tickets for the AFC Championship game?

[00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:12.770]
Come on, let's go.

[00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:14.510]
Here's Miami. Hello.

[00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:16.310]
Hello? Yes, sir.

[00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:17.290]
Am I on here?

[00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:18.170]
It sounds like you.

[00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:18.630]
Wow.

[00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:19.490]
Or your tongue brother.

[00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:20.390]
Oh, wow.

[00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:25.510]
I'm just, my regard, I got a question about the leg you was on before talking about.

[00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:28.130]
You know, this is not the guy who was stuttering, speaking air in words,

[00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:31.150]
because you started, I think they may have rolled off on you, so the story is,

[00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:32.730]
because I can't believe we're hunting on it.

[00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:34.850]
Well, I can't believe what's to hurt such a rony as information.

[00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:38.130]
My girlfriend tells me about the woman who's talking about the sex.

[00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:38.730]
Yeah.

[00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:40.590]
And when you get the little teddy bear with the honey.

[00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:41.110]
Yeah.

[00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:44.030]
Yeah, that's fine, but you don't want to go further in that,

[00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:46.450]
because it can cause infections and whatnot.

[00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:48.050]
Well, not only that, yeah, that's right.

[00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:51.630]
Yeah, well, I can't wait to get a good use infection,

[00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:54.230]
is by putting sugar on Uranus.

[00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:55.810]
Or Mars or Venus.

[00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:59.070]
But the bottom line of the whole thing is that, you know,

[00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:01.090]
nobody really believes she's got any information.

[00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:02.770]
They're just going to get hot and horny listening to it.

[00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:04.550]
Does that make sense?

[00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:06.870]
She's giving her listeners a lot of their ronies information.

[00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:07.770]
It doesn't sound nice.

[00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:08.830]
And probably shows a lot of disease.

[00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:09.810]
That's W-I-O-D.

[00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:10.930]
We are the disease.

[00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:11.890]
Oh, my goodness.

[00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:13.190]
We are the community disease.

[00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:14.910]
Just ask Bill Southmouril, and they'll tell you.

[00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:16.430]
Well, the disease is extending it.

[00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:16.930]
I tell you that.

[00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:17.930]
She is extending it.

[00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:18.390]
In fact, again.

[00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:20.990]
Now, seriously, and for all you uncircumcised guys,

[00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:23.310]
and in this town, we've got just loads and loads.

[00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:26.490]
If I can say that, of those guys, definitely not a good idea.

[00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:28.830]
They've already got a tough enough time keeping a cheese out of there.

[00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:32.390]
And the suggesting pouring honey all over that, forget it.

[00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:33.130]
Well, I love cheese.

[00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:34.370]
I have nothing against cheese.

[00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:36.510]
That sounds like you got a muscle right now.

[00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:37.110]
It's a honey question.

[00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:38.490]
Because, you know, when you've got that,

[00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:41.310]
when you've got that the foreskin, and you've got the honey on there,

[00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:43.390]
I wouldn't be surprised that it worked like crazy glue.

[00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:43.810]
Oh, my God.

[00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:45.050]
You'll never rule that thing back again.

[00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:46.610]
That turtle never gets out of there again.

[00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:49.130]
You must have an HD to come in here before you're sex.

[00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:50.270]
I wouldn't be surprised.

[00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:51.630]
I tell you it was just plate and everything.

[00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:51.910]
Yeah.

[00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:54.350]
Champagne, a little champagne, just to tell you what's like the champagne.

[00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:55.930]
I mean, unbelievable.

[00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:58.130]
Well, I think the champagne, she said.

[00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:02.390]
I thought we fit with, say, take it up your ass.

[00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:04.050]
Maybe she was just talking about the cork.

[00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:08.750]
Well, I'm glad that she's impressed you and have a great life

[00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:10.070]
and don't get the honey, Junior.

[00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:11.510]
We have an open line today.

[00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:13.110]
Yeah, that honey business, that's, I mean,

[00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:18.570]
they have all of those different scented lotions and potions

[00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:19.350]
and stuff like that.

[00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:19.950]
Paddy's place.

[00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:21.050]
They advertise that.

[00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:23.150]
The lotions and potions and lobes and tubes,

[00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:25.330]
scented strawberry, different flavors.

[00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:26.750]
But not honey.

[00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:28.730]
Honey is a very sticky substance.

[00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:31.970]
And if there's going to be a very sticky substance involved in sex,

[00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:34.110]
that isn't the one that generally we think of.

[00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:36.570]
See, I can't say that.

[00:08:36.810 --> 00:08:39.270]
I just did, but I can't say that because that makes it dirty.

[00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:42.610]
But if she speaks like this and she talks with that kind of,

[00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:44.930]
you notice how she's got that very affected tone?

[00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:45.890]
She is going to be great.

[00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:46.630]
I'm not knocking her.

[00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:47.870]
I don't want to, you know, oh, you's knocking her.

[00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:48.570]
No, not at all.

[00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:51.590]
But she does this pseudo intellectual just a little bit

[00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:52.750]
and then she says crap.

[00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:54.750]
You know, so if you say crap,

[00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:56.450]
or if you take one and it's sue,

[00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:58.990]
it would be like if the queen takes a dump.

[00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:01.710]
Nobody is going to say, oh, that's vulgar,

[00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:02.870]
that the queen took a dump.

[00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:05.470]
It had like an air of beauty around it.

[00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:07.670]
It was sophisticated, a sophisticated dump

[00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:09.430]
because it was the queen that left it.

[00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:11.910]
If the queen like farted in an elevator,

[00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:14.090]
oh, isn't that a lovely scent?

[00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:17.170]
Because it was the queen or God forbid the queen mother.

[00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:21.890]
1215 at your over hormone station, WIOD.

[00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:24.470]
Some things in life are easy to describe.

[00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:27.350]
Like the way Madonna looks at five in the morning,

[00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:29.630]
the stadium the morning after a night game,

[00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:32.270]
and a hangover after too much tequila.

[00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:34.930]
But how do you describe the Phil Hendry Show

[00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:37.010]
on 16 WIOD?

[00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:42.230]
Send your answers to WIOD, Miami-33141.

[00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:45.730]
And in the meantime, imagine turning on a night light,

[00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:49.090]
rolling over to see the Phil Hendry Show.

[00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:51.410]
2-6 PM Monday through Saturday.

[00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:53.670]
On News Talk and Entertainment Radio,

[00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:56.430]
610 WIOD.

[00:09:56.990 --> 00:09:58.930]
610 WIOD.

[00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:01.810]
Entertainment for you, paychecks for us.

[00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:05.390]
Oh, Neil, my queen, God.

[00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:06.910]
WIOD.

[00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:08.990]
Oh, Neil, God.

[00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:11.830]
Oh, Neil, God.

[00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:15.090]
Full power, then, I'll present it, man.

[00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:17.590]
I'm the most powerful God-day man in the world.

[00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:30.370]
So, will the Corrosion burgers are made out of people?

[00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:31.030]
No.

[00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:33.570]
Six for never.

[00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:36.870]
And to get that taste of smell out of your system.

[00:10:37.210 --> 00:10:40.370]
While 86% of newborn boys in this cup are circumcised,

[00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:43.210]
the procedure is widely performed without any sort of anesthesia.

[00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:45.310]
I have no pre-pure.

[00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:46.570]
I'm going to eat it.

[00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:47.570]
No, I'm not.

[00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:47.570]

[00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:47.570]

[00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:47.570]

[00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:47.570]

[00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:47.570]

[00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:47.570]

[00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:47.570]

[00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:47.570]

[00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:47.570]

[00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:47.570]

[00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:49.770]
There's God, Neil, God.

[00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:53.050]
Oh, Neil, God.

[00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:55.770]
Oh, Neil, God.

[00:10:56.170 --> 00:10:58.770]
Oh, Neil, God.

[00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:01.790]
Oh, Neil, God.

[00:11:02.650 --> 00:11:03.970]
Oh, Neil, God.

[00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:08.890]
I will not patronize blockbuster or any other company that perpetuates this kind of behaviour.

[00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:09.890]
You jackass.

[00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:13.270]
You're hurting God.

[00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:14.470]
It's me again.

[00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:16.050]
He's an orange on provaculture.

[00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:16.670]
Oh, yeah.

[00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:18.130]
Don't have a bone spot on him.

[00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:18.770]
He's a hile, eh?

[00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:23.490]
I know that the Thorne Eat the Lugger Neorotches.

[00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:25.230]
Father of the Lord, God.

[00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:26.510]
Neil, God.

[00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:29.250]
Oh, yes, they're Mary Comperch.

[00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:31.170]
Neil, God.

[00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:32.650]
Just a lick of it.

[00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:33.630]
How's that hand job?

[00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:34.410]
Something long, John?

[00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:36.210]
Ah, you have no peace.

[00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:38.590]
I don't do my job as well when I'm childhood.

[00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:39.530]
It isn't that.

[00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:40.510]
It's great radio.

[00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:41.650]
I am that hemorrhage.

[00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:43.410]
Do we have a longer cord than a piece of crap?

[00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:43.930]
Look at this.

[00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:45.330]
Look how short this damn thing is.

[00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:48.870]
I'm going to take this cord and I'm going to shove it right up his ass.

[00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:49.730]
Oh, Neil.

[00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:53.030]
This place operates like a freaking nut house.

[00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:53.690]
It really does.

[00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:55.710]
I want to be left a freak alone, OK?

[00:11:55.810 --> 00:11:59.810]
I'm in and mine, but since you've got a fourth of a man to look ridiculous.

[00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:01.030]
Oh, boy.

[00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:02.330]
Yeah, God.

[00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:03.310]
Neil, God.

[00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:06.110]
Oh, she dips their fayon.

[00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:08.010]
They're doing that crap again out there.

[00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:08.490]
God.

[00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:09.330]
Yeah.

[00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:10.410]
Oh, boy.

[00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:11.530]
Yeah, God.

[00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:12.530]
Neil, God.

[00:12:12.530 --> 00:12:13.890]
More power than Neil.

[00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:17.290]
President, say, man, I'm the most powerful God damn man in the world.

[00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:18.850]
I'm so losing correction.

[00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:24.350]
You know, I remembered Brian Sipes name this morning after much constipation with D-4.

[00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:27.810]
It just, it makes me almost feel that I know something about something, not much.

[00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:29.630]
That was, that was a shocker.

[00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:31.710]
You know, these guys, these punks that think they know something.

[00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:33.310]
He wouldn't know when Elliot from a stew Elliot.

[00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:36.210]
It's 11, 12, 120 already.

[00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:38.230]
God, this thing is flying by the man.

[00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:41.710]
Just a matter of moments, it'll be time to go to the bank and put that big check in there.

[00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:43.390]
How's James doing, by the way?

[00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:44.250]
He's still pumping it?

[00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:46.790]
Probably after hearing Aaron Summers, he's getting going.

[00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:49.870]
I got another facts from Greg, by the way, for those who are keeping track.

[00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:52.870]
Oh, Greg, get a life.

[00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:56.870]
And also he's going on about how he spelled all right and already with two L's.

[00:12:56.930 --> 00:12:57.990]
And now, of course, he's corrected that.

[00:12:58.050 --> 00:13:04.470]
But he does say, he says, I'm not, I am not a typical freeloader that calls and asks for something for free.

[00:13:05.170 --> 00:13:06.290]
Grammatically, that's incorrect.

[00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:08.390]
It would be who calls, not that calls.

[00:13:08.770 --> 00:13:09.910]
People cannot be that.

[00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:13.990]
I am a person that, no, you're a person who got it?

[00:13:14.450 --> 00:13:16.070]
Okay, you're working on it, Greg. He's getting there.

[00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:19.910]
Probably was educated in Florida. In fact, he says he was. That explains it.

[00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:22.590]
But we do have this awesome educational system in America.

[00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:24.890]
Just ask Steve Patterson. He's a product of it.

[00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:28.030]
As an, oh, here's Boka. Hello.

[00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:29.370]
Hello. Yes, sir.

[00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:30.390]
Neil. How you doing?

[00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:30.790]
It's a God.

[00:13:31.130 --> 00:13:32.530]
How you doing, Scott? Good. How are you?

[00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:33.330]
How the hanging, baby?

[00:13:33.650 --> 00:13:34.110]
Pretty good.

[00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:38.010]
I just wanted to call and tell you that the Patriots are the best.

[00:13:38.010 --> 00:13:40.130]
And I lived in Boston for 11 years.

[00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:41.190]
And they took you out of there?

[00:13:41.650 --> 00:13:44.730]
Yeah, they had to, I had to move down here and walk in the suckiest office.

[00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:47.150]
How depressing to happily Boston, man.

[00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:49.230]
Although this weekend's going to be quarter-nall hell up there.

[00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:49.930]
It's going to be bad.

[00:13:50.290 --> 00:13:51.550]
Oh, yeah, but it's fun out there, man.

[00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:52.330]
It is fun out there.

[00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:54.590]
You got real living and breathing people up there.

[00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:58.410]
All those colleges, all those universities, all those great institutions of learning and yearning.

[00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:00.150]
And like, it's a real place with real people.

[00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:00.690]
Yeah.

[00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:05.530]
And great restaurants and great ambiance and history and Paul Revere and all that crap.

[00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:06.510]
It's a great island, Boston.

[00:14:06.690 --> 00:14:07.410]
Yeah, Boston's great.

[00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:12.490]
And Drew Bletsville, man, I'll tell you with the next five years, he's going to make everybody forget about Danny Moreno.

[00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:14.330]
Oh, I guarantee you that right now.

[00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:16.830]
Danny's great, but Drew Bletsville is smash-a-roll.

[00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:18.030]
I'm going to make all the records for him, and then Bletsville is just going to break them.

[00:14:18.130 --> 00:14:18.470]
That's right.

[00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:19.030]
That's right.

[00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:19.850]
You got it.

[00:14:20.510 --> 00:14:21.570]
And guess what else?

[00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:21.990]
Yes.

[00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:23.810]
The pride of going to any Patriots again.

[00:14:24.070 --> 00:14:24.470]
Why is that?

[00:14:24.850 --> 00:14:25.250]
I don't know.

[00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:27.250]
They didn't want to go all the way out to Foxboro.

[00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:27.850]
Yeah.

[00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:29.230]
Yeah, I really suck.

[00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:35.770]
So I was a pretty sad commentary that an area like Boston where they, I mean, that they sold out all the games before the season started.

[00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:40.950]
And an area like this with four million people that there were many games with big chunks of empty seats.

[00:14:40.970 --> 00:14:42.590]
That's some commentary on this town.

[00:14:42.770 --> 00:14:43.350]
That's terrible.

[00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:43.670]
Yeah.

[00:14:45.130 --> 00:14:50.270]
But my dad, his birthday is coming up, and I was wondering if I could get those tickets to the conference.

[00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:52.790]
Well, listen, Scott, wish him a happy birthday for me, okay?

[00:14:52.890 --> 00:14:53.130]
All right.

[00:14:53.310 --> 00:14:54.030]
And have a great new year.

[00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:54.250]
Right.

[00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:54.810]
See ya.

[00:14:57.210 --> 00:14:58.190]
Nice try, Scott.

[00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:00.030]
Scott's a good guy.

[00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:02.670]
You know, something that might be the Patriots and the dolphins in that game.

[00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:04.130]
Scott and his dad would have a great time.

[00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:05.030]
Damn it, I blew it.

[00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:07.230]
Should have given him a Scott, but I didn't.

[00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:08.850]
That would have been a good, not a nice thing to do.

[00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:12.530]
But then he had a head two guys rooting for the Patriots there and that they would have turned on me.

[00:15:13.170 --> 00:15:17.150]
I guarantee you, we got plenty of people in this audience that hope the dolphins get pasted this Saturday.

[00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:20.050]
That are wishing that they just get blown right away, huh?

[00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:23.970]
There's nothing to get worse than, that's what Aaron Summers said.

[00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:26.790]
Get the honey, Danny.

[00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:30.310]
Wonder if Brian Cox is going to be a calm, Danny, honey.

[00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:31.590]
Probably right after the game.

[00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:33.750]
Or maybe that's Mande's for confusing them.

[00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:34.530]
You jackass.

[00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:36.070]
Okay, where are we going next?

[00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:38.530]
Two, I don't know what to do about those tickets to be honest with you.

[00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:39.470]
That was a nice try, Scott.

[00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:40.590]
Here's Lauderdale.

[00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:40.850]
Hello.

[00:15:41.450 --> 00:15:43.130]
Hey, Neil, you leaving me hanging here.

[00:15:43.290 --> 00:15:43.530]
Am I?

[00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:44.070]
Yeah.

[00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:46.350]
Hey, I want to tell you I'm staying with my sister-in-law.

[00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:47.090]
You know what does that mean?

[00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:47.890]
I'm leaving you hanging.

[00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:50.210]
Well, I've been on the phone since Hector was a pup.

[00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:50.770]
Yeah.

[00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:54.490]
Stay with my sister-in-law and then follow it down in Lauderdale.

[00:15:54.770 --> 00:15:54.930]
Yeah.

[00:15:54.970 --> 00:15:55.970]
I got to tell you this memo.

[00:15:56.170 --> 00:15:58.070]
You know, talking about parking down by Joe Robbie.

[00:15:58.210 --> 00:15:59.410]
Let me say about parking here.

[00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:04.170]
We made the mistake of a backing in and we received a letter saying.

[00:16:04.190 --> 00:16:05.730]
Didn't you hear what Erin just said on it?

[00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:07.370]
Tate, we played Never Back In.

[00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:08.050]
That's right.

[00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:09.110]
Well, I learned that.

[00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:11.810]
When in doubt back out, but don't ever back in, she said.

[00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:14.450]
Well, we may not back in or drive away.

[00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:15.410]
We must pull in frontwards.

[00:16:16.750 --> 00:16:17.050]
Wow.

[00:16:17.370 --> 00:16:18.530]
Always pull in frontwards.

[00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:20.050]
There you go.

[00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:21.730]
That's good work to live by.

[00:16:22.070 --> 00:16:26.670]
So anyway, a couple more days and then we'll be released, I think, for bad behavior.

[00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:26.950]
Yeah.

[00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:28.630]
We'll be able to go back to sunny Austin.

[00:16:29.410 --> 00:16:30.370]
Oh, you're going to Austin?

[00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:30.830]
Aha.

[00:16:31.410 --> 00:16:32.290]
Well, that's not a bad place.

[00:16:32.290 --> 00:16:36.630]
I'd never been there, but I hear it's like a bastion of almost the modern thinking, almost.

[00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:38.550]
Well, now the Republicans won.

[00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:39.410]
That's going to change.

[00:16:39.630 --> 00:16:40.110]
Yeah, probably.

[00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:40.850]
Same thing.

[00:16:41.050 --> 00:16:41.630]
Coast to coast.

[00:16:41.970 --> 00:16:44.510]
So under any circumstances, don't give me the tickets.

[00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:44.910]
Okay.

[00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:45.830]
You got it.

[00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:47.750]
We have an open line in Broward.

[00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:48.990]
524, I just want to please.

[00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:49.550]
That's where we're here.

[00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:50.370]
We aim to please.

[00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:51.170]
That's what Erin know.

[00:16:51.270 --> 00:16:52.310]
We said, aim to please.

[00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:52.990]
Squared, Squared.

[00:16:53.090 --> 00:16:54.310]
Peter and Earth was there for his pupil.

[00:16:57.450 --> 00:17:00.590]
He gets high marks right up about that high.

[00:17:01.950 --> 00:17:04.070]
1224 WIOD just below the ceiling up there.

[00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:06.930]
Where we gone to a South Miami, he said, hello.

[00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:10.110]
And honey, I miss you.

[00:17:12.690 --> 00:17:13.350]
It's a.

[00:17:13.610 --> 00:17:14.230]
Bobby Goldblum.

[00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:15.330]
I was going to say Glenn Campbell.

[00:17:15.410 --> 00:17:18.430]
I always get Bobby Goldblum, Glenn Campbell confused.

[00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:19.010]
It's Bobby.

[00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:23.150]
How he'd heard from Bobby in a long time as a matter of fact since he got stuck at honey.

[00:17:24.350 --> 00:17:25.450]
That's all I wanted to say.

[00:17:25.450 --> 00:17:27.150]
I've waited for half hours just to sing that song.

[00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:27.970]
Beautiful job, pal.

[00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:28.670]
How do you like Erin?

[00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:30.010]
Not bad.

[00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:30.810]
There you go.

[00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:33.130]
I'm going in the bathroom right now.

[00:17:33.170 --> 00:17:34.510]
Okay, go wipe the smile on the head.

[00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:35.050]
Let's see.

[00:17:35.250 --> 00:17:35.310]
Okay.

[00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:36.310]
Go wipe off.

[00:17:36.690 --> 00:17:37.610]
We have an open line indeed.

[00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:38.550]
751.

[00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:40.210]
Let's hear a little more of that Erin Summers, George.

[00:17:40.210 --> 00:17:40.570]
One more.

[00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:40.890]
That's worthwhile.

[00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:42.690]
Woman, I'm going to be real honest with you.

[00:17:43.690 --> 00:17:47.110]
Everybody has limitations in some way, shape, or form.

[00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:48.190]
Some limitations.

[00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:48.990]
We can see.

[00:17:49.210 --> 00:17:50.490]
We can hear other limitations.

[00:17:50.690 --> 00:17:51.470]
We can't.

[00:17:51.910 --> 00:17:53.450]
I think you just need to have more.

[00:17:53.450 --> 00:17:55.250]
Yeah, confidence in yourself.

[00:17:55.250 --> 00:17:58.510]
When you go up to a woman's God, just be yourself.

[00:17:58.730 --> 00:18:00.690]
You know, there is a good woman to approach.

[00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:01.110]
You really?

[00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:02.430]
Somebody who's making eye-conquering.

[00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:03.210]
It's not a good idea.

[00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:05.910]
When you go up, don't try to say, you know, I'll pick up line.

[00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:06.530]
Be yourself.

[00:18:06.530 --> 00:18:07.830]
Just say hello.

[00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:10.550]
And a good sense of humor doesn't hurt either.

[00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:12.310]
I think Rick is your only chance.

[00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:14.030]
Don't even worry about the stuttering.

[00:18:14.290 --> 00:18:17.850]
Just, you know, have self confidence and just go for it.

[00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:18.870]
You're going to find the right gal.

[00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:20.170]
I have no doubt about that.

[00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:20.890]
Good luck, Scott.

[00:18:21.910 --> 00:18:22.890]
Well, you talk about...

[00:18:22.890 --> 00:18:25.270]
I have a son out with this girl probably five or even one.

[00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:25.470]

[00:18:25.570 --> 00:18:25.810]
Okay.

[00:18:26.250 --> 00:18:28.510]
Two years later, he gets engaged to her.

[00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:29.390]
This is your friend.

[00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:29.950]
Right.

[00:18:30.730 --> 00:18:32.290]
And then they break it off.

[00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:32.670]
Mm-hmm.

[00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:34.190]
She and I never had sex.

[00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:36.590]
We had, you know, some good oral sex and things like that.

[00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:36.890]
Right.

[00:18:37.570 --> 00:18:38.890]
But she's coming down here.

[00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:40.690]
Wait, what does that mean?

[00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:41.550]
We never had sex.

[00:18:41.730 --> 00:18:42.750]
We had some good oral sex.

[00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:43.670]
They never had intercourse.

[00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:45.330]
See, this is one of the things.

[00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:46.730]
We need Joyslin elders in it.

[00:18:46.850 --> 00:18:49.790]
Joyslin, Joyslin, Juslin, what, Juslin, whatever her name is.

[00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:50.550]
Royslin.

[00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:53.190]
You know, sex is sex, okay?

[00:18:53.910 --> 00:18:55.910]
And that's one of the things that people don't understand.

[00:18:55.910 --> 00:18:59.030]
That's why these young people are out there doing the old in-out all the time.

[00:18:59.150 --> 00:19:01.090]
Because they don't understand there's other ways to do it.

[00:19:01.090 --> 00:19:03.210]
And of course, if she was any kind of a bitch, which she's not,

[00:19:03.450 --> 00:19:04.450]
she'd be telling people that.

[00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:05.690]
Now, let's see what she tells her, okay?

[00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:07.610]
Basically, you know, she talked to me about it.

[00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:09.130]
And she's wanting to sleep with me.

[00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:11.630]
Now, is it odd for me?

[00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:12.690]
She's been in sex either way.

[00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:17.590]
How should I feel about going out now with his ex Beyonce?

[00:19:18.730 --> 00:19:20.230]
How good are friends of the two of you?

[00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:21.190]
How should I feel about it?

[00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:21.390]
Oh, God.

[00:19:21.770 --> 00:19:22.690]
We're pretty deep in the matter.

[00:19:23.090 --> 00:19:24.670]
That's like that old line about the doctor.

[00:19:24.790 --> 00:19:27.330]
The guy goes in and the doctor's offices, hey, Doc, how do I feel?

[00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:29.690]
I mean, what is that?

[00:19:30.290 --> 00:19:31.330]
How should I feel?

[00:19:31.810 --> 00:19:32.750]
Feel this, pal.

[00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:36.930]
Just recently, a few days ago, I found out that right after I found out,

[00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:40.690]
I think, I told you about the girl that I was seeing after I moved out.

[00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:41.450]
Oh, my God.

[00:19:41.450 --> 00:19:43.310]
And a hole like that, who needs enemies, huh?

[00:19:44.110 --> 00:19:45.590]
But see, he didn't sleep with her.

[00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:46.510]
He didn't sleep with that.

[00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:47.970]
No, just that sex, you don't need to sleep.

[00:19:48.050 --> 00:19:48.930]
You don't have to feel that in a separate room.

[00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:50.730]
Even though they're broken up now or...

[00:19:50.730 --> 00:19:54.190]
Well, I mean, if you, okay, first off, if you get together with her,

[00:19:54.290 --> 00:19:57.090]
I mean, it would be strictly for sex, or do you see the possibility

[00:19:57.090 --> 00:19:59.550]
there might be a renewed friendship or relationship?

[00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:02.690]
More than likely, just sex.

[00:20:03.570 --> 00:20:05.910]
For my looking at it, I don't know how he's talking about it.

[00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:06.010]
All right.

[00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:07.210]
All right.

[00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:10.030]
If you do sleep with her and it's only going to be sex.

[00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:10.950]
Forget the sleeping butt.

[00:20:11.090 --> 00:20:13.030]
If your friend is going to be upset by this.

[00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:16.350]
Because there's a good chance he will find out.

[00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:16.830]
Yeah.

[00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:21.410]
He would probably be upset, especially since he turned this other person out.

[00:20:21.410 --> 00:20:21.950]
How big is your friend?

[00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:22.910]
That's the obvious question.

[00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:24.130]
Can you beat the little crap out?

[00:20:24.130 --> 00:20:24.810]
And that's the problem.

[00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:26.090]
And if he was any kind of friend.

[00:20:26.130 --> 00:20:30.290]
I think you're praying with fire to ruin her friendship between you and this guy.

[00:20:30.670 --> 00:20:33.110]
If you called in tonight, Steve, and you're out one on it.

[00:20:33.170 --> 00:20:34.930]
So what if he wanted me to be a friend with this guy as you want to get away?

[00:20:35.050 --> 00:20:35.830]
That's the obvious question.

[00:20:35.950 --> 00:20:36.670]
Why did he go in front of the girl?

[00:20:36.910 --> 00:20:37.950]
To go for it?

[00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:38.050]
Right.

[00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:39.170]
He was a good friend of one of my friends.

[00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:39.950]
That's right.

[00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:43.590]
I think number one, he will find out.

[00:20:44.030 --> 00:20:45.930]
Where's the line about a cheering experience?

[00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:46.770]
That's where it's at.

[00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:47.530]
That's where it's at.

[00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:48.470]
I'll just stay away.

[00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:52.050]
There's other women that you can have a sexual relationship down here.

[00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:52.550]
I'll look at you for a picture.

[00:20:52.550 --> 00:20:54.130]
Or of course there's always sex with yourself.

[00:20:54.330 --> 00:20:55.630]
And there's certainly nothing wrong with that.

[00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:56.570]
But have a good time with her.

[00:20:56.610 --> 00:20:57.410]
But stay out of her drawers.

[00:20:57.610 --> 00:20:58.330]
That's what I would say.

[00:20:59.130 --> 00:20:59.370]
Yeah.

[00:20:59.790 --> 00:21:01.910]
But as far as her chest and her bureau, that's okay.

[00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:03.510]
What was that?

[00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:05.550]
We had great oral sex, but we didn't have sex.

[00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:06.730]
I get out of here already.

[00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:06.990]
Where?

[00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:07.890]
Jesus.

[00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:09.790]
Get the honey.

[00:21:09.790 --> 00:21:10.190]
I'm going to be a great junior.

[00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:12.470]
Okay.

[00:21:12.610 --> 00:21:14.570]
Let's do a little break here while everybody recovers now.

[00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:16.710]
Like I said, she's going to be great, but it's obvious.

[00:21:16.850 --> 00:21:18.510]
She hasn't got any idea what she's talking about.

[00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:21.910]
So while you guys and women, if you want advice, forget about it.

[00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:25.110]
But if you want to get titillated, this is definitely going to be the show for you.

[00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:27.990]
1229 and she's got a great ass in WIOD.

[00:21:28.410 --> 00:21:29.590]
1233 at WIOD.

[00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:30.950]
Happy Thursday to you.

[00:21:31.050 --> 00:21:32.190]
Boy, it's getting pretty close again.

[00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:33.150]
Not tomorrow.

[00:21:33.670 --> 00:21:35.370]
Is the office open tomorrow or not?

[00:21:36.550 --> 00:21:37.210]
We don't know.

[00:21:37.530 --> 00:21:38.230]
I doubt it.

[00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:41.530]
Because here's another great opportunity, but I'm not going to say too much because we got

[00:21:41.530 --> 00:21:41.990]
Monday off.

[00:21:42.050 --> 00:21:42.750]
Oh, I love it.

[00:21:42.890 --> 00:21:45.830]
I love these long bustman holidays and they can take all the days off they want.

[00:21:46.170 --> 00:21:47.950]
I don't think there'll be too much of a crowd here tomorrow.

[00:21:48.030 --> 00:21:50.390]
And then of course Saturday and Sunday and Monday.

[00:21:50.970 --> 00:21:53.950]
But Rick and Sots will be back on Monday morning and won't that be a little slap into

[00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:54.830]
push when they find out there.

[00:21:54.850 --> 00:21:56.050]
The only ones working live that day.

[00:21:56.170 --> 00:21:57.030]
What a bad break.

[00:21:57.690 --> 00:21:58.510]
But Rick's tickets.

[00:21:58.670 --> 00:22:01.550]
I will leave them in his box, though, for Monday morning, even though the game is Saturday.

[00:22:02.030 --> 00:22:03.530]
I still have heard nothing about that.

[00:22:03.610 --> 00:22:04.430]
He is a moron.

[00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:04.930]
He really is.

[00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:06.490]
I want to make it official right now.

[00:22:06.490 --> 00:22:09.130]
Rick Riley could be the dumbest man on the face of the earth.

[00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:11.310]
I'm walking around and I don't like it.

[00:22:11.410 --> 00:22:12.410]
I can lose those tickets.

[00:22:12.610 --> 00:22:13.730]
They can get burned in a fire.

[00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:15.030]
I mean, it's anything going to happen to him.

[00:22:15.290 --> 00:22:18.110]
And once they're gone, it's not like, oh, well, I will replace him for.

[00:22:18.190 --> 00:22:18.870]
We know they're your seats.

[00:22:18.970 --> 00:22:19.550]
Forget it.

[00:22:19.870 --> 00:22:21.270]
Once they're gone, they be gone.

[00:22:21.530 --> 00:22:25.510]
I think we should give him away today because he's not making any real effort.

[00:22:25.650 --> 00:22:26.770]
That Mark production mark.

[00:22:26.910 --> 00:22:27.650]
He's not here today.

[00:22:27.850 --> 00:22:28.830]
He sure won't be here tomorrow.

[00:22:30.030 --> 00:22:31.410]
So what the hell is he talking about?

[00:22:31.550 --> 00:22:32.550]
Mark's going to bring him up to him.

[00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:33.430]
Forget it, Rick.

[00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:34.710]
There are history, maybe.

[00:22:34.890 --> 00:22:36.730]
Your dead meat and your tickets are gone.

[00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:37.330]
Who wants them?

[00:22:38.650 --> 00:22:39.710]
Here's a crawl springs.

[00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:40.050]
Hello?

[00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:41.670]
Hello?

[00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:43.010]
Crawl Springs.

[00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:43.970]
They'll listen to the radio.

[00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:45.290]
They got it cranked up.

[00:22:45.470 --> 00:22:47.090]
Probably the air in summer shows what they do to him.

[00:22:47.290 --> 00:22:47.510]
Hello?

[00:22:48.250 --> 00:22:49.850]
Well, bring the listen to the radio.

[00:22:50.030 --> 00:22:50.390]
Look at that.

[00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:52.230]
Everybody that was on hold, ran to the john.

[00:22:53.050 --> 00:22:53.450]
Hello?

[00:22:55.690 --> 00:22:56.310]
Look at that.

[00:22:56.490 --> 00:22:58.130]
Everybody that was on hold, ran to the john.

[00:22:59.030 --> 00:22:59.670]
Time tunnel.

[00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:00.430]
This is good.

[00:23:01.890 --> 00:23:03.330]
Time tunnel, a crawl springs.

[00:23:05.090 --> 00:23:05.450]
Asshole.

[00:23:05.810 --> 00:23:07.490]
And I was going to give them Rick's tickets too.

[00:23:07.670 --> 00:23:08.050]
Bad break.

[00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:09.210]
Maybe that was Rick.

[00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:13.650]
Open line in Broward 5249463-524-WYOD.

[00:23:13.650 --> 00:23:14.310]
Here's North Miami.

[00:23:14.530 --> 00:23:14.690]
Hello?

[00:23:14.970 --> 00:23:15.670]
Hello, North Miami.

[00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:17.230]
Hello, it's back to you.

[00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:17.770]
Hey, listen.

[00:23:17.950 --> 00:23:20.630]
You guys are going to have a new show there with the air in check.

[00:23:20.790 --> 00:23:21.090]
Is that right?

[00:23:21.210 --> 00:23:21.830]
With the air in bitch.

[00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:22.470]
Yeah, I would say.

[00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:26.050]
Man, that sounds like it's just going to be an audio-rich lake show to me.

[00:23:26.430 --> 00:23:27.270]
Oh, get out of here.

[00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:27.870]
Rikki, Lake.

[00:23:27.870 --> 00:23:30.730]
I think she just got a bunch of trailer park trash on that show.

[00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:36.550]
She just got a bunch of Yahoo's staging all these fake arguments, back screaming, back

[00:23:36.550 --> 00:23:36.870]
and forth.

[00:23:37.130 --> 00:23:39.210]
Oh, when I was young, you did bad things to me.

[00:23:39.330 --> 00:23:40.270]
And you didn't care about me.

[00:23:40.510 --> 00:23:41.550]
And now that I'm old and disgusting.

[00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:43.170]
And this, uh, forget it.

[00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:48.070]
She got the 18 year old wife that's married to the five year old kid and the 85 year old

[00:23:48.070 --> 00:23:48.290]
man.

[00:23:48.490 --> 00:23:50.950]
That's Mary and her daughter, Mookie and the Mookie's Mookie.

[00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:51.930]
They called in.

[00:23:52.030 --> 00:23:52.250]
Listen.

[00:23:52.690 --> 00:23:53.710]
Oh, how to heck with it in any way.

[00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:54.710]
I'm not going to.

[00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:55.410]
That's what I say.

[00:23:55.410 --> 00:23:57.210]
I, uh, I've never heard.

[00:23:57.310 --> 00:24:01.430]
I've been told about the tape that you have about the guy drives a car around.

[00:24:01.550 --> 00:24:02.250]
It's an asshole.

[00:24:02.550 --> 00:24:05.570]
He does all sorts of weird things on the highway.

[00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:06.850]
I've never heard that thing.

[00:24:06.910 --> 00:24:07.830]
You still have it active?

[00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:09.410]
Do I have it active?

[00:24:09.530 --> 00:24:10.590]
Yes, it's still in the engine.

[00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:11.350]
It's like a yeast infection.

[00:24:11.410 --> 00:24:12.110]
It's still active.

[00:24:12.250 --> 00:24:12.730]
Yeah, it's in there.

[00:24:12.790 --> 00:24:14.690]
I might, if I feel real good, I might play that.

[00:24:14.810 --> 00:24:16.030]
Well, you'd certainly make my day.

[00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:16.490]
Okay.

[00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:17.590]
Thank you very much.

[00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:18.110]
Have a great day.

[00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:18.630]
You too.

[00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:19.210]
Happy New Year.

[00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:19.690]
You too.

[00:24:19.810 --> 00:24:20.070]
Bye-bye.

[00:24:20.190 --> 00:24:20.610]
Bye-bye.

[00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:21.310]
You all come back.

[00:24:21.310 --> 00:24:21.950]
The year.

[00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:23.450]
Open line and date.

[00:24:23.450 --> 00:24:24.750]
He must be from Taylor Michigan.

[00:24:24.930 --> 00:24:25.750]
I hope Dick still listening.

[00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:27.650]
He's the only one in America knows what Taylor's all about.

[00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:31.490]
That's where they got that big economy-sized jar of gasoline on top of the old TV, baby,

[00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:32.510]
with the rabbit ears.

[00:24:33.550 --> 00:24:35.570]
And they multiply like rabbits in Taylor Michigan.

[00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:37.170]
You see, I don't understand that.

[00:24:37.270 --> 00:24:38.650]
How can there be red necks up north?

[00:24:38.770 --> 00:24:39.810]
We were talking about this the other day.

[00:24:40.190 --> 00:24:41.870]
They're red necks, but they live in the north.

[00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:46.210]
But then when you really stop and analyze what this country's all about, like in New

[00:24:46.210 --> 00:24:51.110]
York State, people think people from New York are all like New York City.

[00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:52.290]
They type people and they're not.

[00:24:53.530 --> 00:24:56.710]
Because people from like as soon as you get up, I would say north of Yonkers.

[00:24:56.710 --> 00:24:57.470]
Forget it.

[00:24:57.930 --> 00:25:01.510]
Like in Utica and Schenecto, in Albany and Rochester and Binghamton and Cornie and

[00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:06.450]
Ithaca and Lawrence and Lee Roy.

[00:25:07.410 --> 00:25:09.010]
Who wants to go to an F and D.

[00:25:09.090 --> 00:25:10.310]
It's cool anyway, Lee Roy.

[00:25:11.730 --> 00:25:12.950]
And places like that.

[00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:13.930]
They're farmers.

[00:25:14.730 --> 00:25:16.130]
They're mostly farmers.

[00:25:16.130 --> 00:25:22.630]
And you go to Iowa and Nebraska and Kansas and North and South Dakota and Montana and

[00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:24.750]
Wyoming and Utah.

[00:25:24.910 --> 00:25:25.570]
Well, Utah's the difference.

[00:25:25.750 --> 00:25:27.610]
They're more more more mons.

[00:25:28.050 --> 00:25:29.610]
But like in all those others, I guess what?

[00:25:29.770 --> 00:25:30.310]
They're farmers.

[00:25:31.230 --> 00:25:33.210]
Oklahoma, Texas, Louisiana.

[00:25:33.610 --> 00:25:34.150]
They're farmers.

[00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:38.750]
There's nothing but a big bunch of freaking farmers in this country and how much different

[00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:41.090]
is farmers from red necks when you come right down to it.

[00:25:41.090 --> 00:25:42.370]
They're farmers, man.

[00:25:42.830 --> 00:25:46.270]
There's big city slickers and there's farmers and then there's people from Nashville.

[00:25:47.850 --> 00:25:48.250]
OK.

[00:25:48.790 --> 00:25:51.390]
There's no sense of getting your sighted about if that's America for it and that's why

[00:25:51.390 --> 00:25:52.470]
it's in the shape that it's in today.

[00:25:52.790 --> 00:25:54.070]
Just ask Old Newt.

[00:25:54.570 --> 00:25:56.290]
Here's Miami Lakes on a powered line.

[00:25:56.890 --> 00:25:57.050]
New.

[00:25:57.650 --> 00:25:58.250]
Desperate, yes.

[00:25:58.530 --> 00:25:59.310]
Hey, how you doing?

[00:25:59.450 --> 00:25:59.690]
Good.

[00:26:00.250 --> 00:26:01.310]
Hey, about that, everyone.

[00:26:02.010 --> 00:26:02.290]
Yeah.

[00:26:02.550 --> 00:26:04.530]
One sexy hot thing.

[00:26:04.870 --> 00:26:06.090]
She is a hot number, man.

[00:26:06.190 --> 00:26:07.450]
Hey, he's got the hottest ass.

[00:26:07.590 --> 00:26:08.090]
He's so hot.

[00:26:08.410 --> 00:26:08.750]
Yeah.

[00:26:09.150 --> 00:26:10.910]
Boy, it sounds to me like you're just on the edge.

[00:26:10.910 --> 00:26:12.650]
Hey, hey, or maybe over the edge.

[00:26:12.670 --> 00:26:13.750]
I can't wait to get home.

[00:26:13.930 --> 00:26:14.110]
Yeah.

[00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:17.690]
Well, the tent of the sale on wet naps is going to really be going up pretty good.

[00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:18.190]
Yeah.

[00:26:18.570 --> 00:26:19.750]
And about that, honey.

[00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:20.270]
Yeah.

[00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:22.850]
It works, but you have to try lick a pet.

[00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:24.490]
Lick a pet.

[00:26:24.730 --> 00:26:26.350]
Yeah, something sexy on North Miami.

[00:26:26.810 --> 00:26:27.010]
Yeah.

[00:26:27.290 --> 00:26:28.350]
They sell lick a pet.

[00:26:28.530 --> 00:26:29.450]
You have to try it.

[00:26:29.650 --> 00:26:30.290]
Lick a pet?

[00:26:30.510 --> 00:26:31.330]
Lick a pet.

[00:26:31.570 --> 00:26:31.950]
Lick it?

[00:26:32.130 --> 00:26:32.530]
Yeah.

[00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:34.230]
Start licking.

[00:26:34.490 --> 00:26:34.670]
Yeah.

[00:26:35.050 --> 00:26:35.350]
Yeah.

[00:26:35.770 --> 00:26:38.150]
Sounds like a voice of experience to me.

[00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:38.910]
Hey, man.

[00:26:39.330 --> 00:26:39.490]
Yeah.

[00:26:40.210 --> 00:26:41.410]
We do it all the way.

[00:26:41.690 --> 00:26:42.010]
Do it.

[00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:45.210]
Hey, by the way, I'm a big dealer fan.

[00:26:45.330 --> 00:26:46.430]
We're going all the way this year.

[00:26:46.650 --> 00:26:46.850]
Yeah.

[00:26:47.290 --> 00:26:48.970]
I'll be sure to bring that lick a pet when you do.

[00:26:50.770 --> 00:26:51.630]
And what about?

[00:26:51.870 --> 00:26:53.290]
Yeah, Mike Tom's that he's not too bad.

[00:26:53.870 --> 00:26:56.170]
Mike Tom's that yeah, I rather him than an old Donald.

[00:26:56.330 --> 00:26:56.850]
There you go.

[00:26:56.870 --> 00:26:57.830]
Oh, Donald's sucks.

[00:26:58.070 --> 00:26:59.590]
Mike might let you lick him.

[00:26:59.730 --> 00:26:59.730]

[00:26:59.890 --> 00:27:01.150]
Oh, Donald's sucks, but Mike looks.

[00:27:01.610 --> 00:27:02.430]
OK, good luck to you, pal.

[00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:03.510]
OK, take a seat.

[00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:04.130]
Yeah, lick a pet.

[00:27:04.330 --> 00:27:04.790]
See, lick this.

[00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:07.710]
So all of a sudden, this errand summer, she hasn't even started it.

[00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:09.290]
And she started this whole new deal now,

[00:27:09.430 --> 00:27:11.890]
like she invented it with all kinds of like,

[00:27:12.010 --> 00:27:13.750]
saves and potions, like that's something

[00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:14.870]
new that she just discovered.

[00:27:15.570 --> 00:27:17.650]
See, basically, her show is informational

[00:27:17.650 --> 00:27:20.410]
and it's misinformation for retarded people.

[00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:21.810]
For people who are like very inhibited

[00:27:21.810 --> 00:27:24.090]
and have no idea what anything in life is all about.

[00:27:25.090 --> 00:27:27.250]
Like the woman who wanted to have an orgasm.

[00:27:27.490 --> 00:27:29.130]
What the hell makes her think that women are entitled

[00:27:29.130 --> 00:27:30.210]
to have orgasms anyway?

[00:27:30.370 --> 00:27:31.570]
What is she, some kind of a smart ass?

[00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:37.350]
Boy, talk about a possessive obnoxious manipulative

[00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:37.790]
bitch.

[00:27:39.430 --> 00:27:40.890]
Here's the lady in the South Miami.

[00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:41.250]
Hello.

[00:27:41.530 --> 00:27:42.110]
Hi, Neil.

[00:27:42.270 --> 00:27:42.730]
How are you doing?

[00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:43.450]
How are you?

[00:27:43.690 --> 00:27:44.190]
I'm great.

[00:27:44.330 --> 00:27:45.070]
Happy New Year.

[00:27:45.210 --> 00:27:45.870]
And back to you.

[00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:46.890]
I'm 1995.

[00:27:47.810 --> 00:27:48.570]
It's almost here.

[00:27:48.650 --> 00:27:48.830]
Hi.

[00:27:49.050 --> 00:27:51.950]
Those years just keep rolling and rolling and rolling along.

[00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:53.550]
So remind me, I feel like I'm getting old.

[00:27:53.550 --> 00:27:55.450]
And we keep getting older and older.

[00:27:55.530 --> 00:27:57.950]
And everybody we knew is dying and it's really great.

[00:27:58.310 --> 00:27:59.310]
Well, good joy.

[00:27:59.490 --> 00:27:59.630]
Yeah.

[00:27:59.730 --> 00:28:00.390]
Especially down here.

[00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:00.970]
Yeah.

[00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:02.770]
In fact, that's one of the great hobbies

[00:28:02.770 --> 00:28:04.370]
done here is reading your bitch worries every day.

[00:28:04.390 --> 00:28:04.910]
It's a lot of fun.

[00:28:05.150 --> 00:28:06.170]
It takes a lot of time.

[00:28:06.170 --> 00:28:07.810]
It's good when you're eating your breakfast.

[00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:08.790]
It gives them the do.

[00:28:09.030 --> 00:28:11.190]
And then you see like they were 110 and 97.

[00:28:11.390 --> 00:28:12.030]
Oh, god.

[00:28:12.170 --> 00:28:12.970]
I got a long way to go.

[00:28:13.030 --> 00:28:14.170]
I'm just a queen ageer.

[00:28:14.330 --> 00:28:14.690]
Exactly.

[00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:16.310]
Well, I am a teenager, basically.

[00:28:16.510 --> 00:28:17.550]
I'm going to be 25.

[00:28:17.890 --> 00:28:19.430]
Oh, just a young thing.

[00:28:19.790 --> 00:28:21.050]
I'm still a pup, I guess.

[00:28:21.090 --> 00:28:22.490]
Well, then we apologize for playing

[00:28:22.490 --> 00:28:24.410]
that ear and summer's because your young tender ears

[00:28:24.410 --> 00:28:26.930]
are much, much too young for hearing that stuff.

[00:28:27.070 --> 00:28:28.530]
And my virgin ears, oh my goodness.

[00:28:29.810 --> 00:28:31.390]
I do have a shameless request that I've

[00:28:31.390 --> 00:28:33.430]
been trying to get from you all week long.

[00:28:33.490 --> 00:28:34.210]
For you, anything?

[00:28:34.210 --> 00:28:35.910]
She talks to Guido's?

[00:28:36.150 --> 00:28:37.350]
She talks to Guidos.

[00:28:38.030 --> 00:28:39.570]
Haven't played that in the coons age, you know?

[00:28:39.710 --> 00:28:39.930]
Hello.

[00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:41.470]
And it's ready to fire right now.

[00:28:41.690 --> 00:28:42.190]
Oh, thank you so much.

[00:28:42.190 --> 00:28:43.630]
We got Guido in the oven right now.

[00:28:43.930 --> 00:28:44.330]
Thank you.

[00:28:44.430 --> 00:28:45.070]
Have a great one.

[00:28:45.210 --> 00:28:45.530]
You too.

[00:28:45.670 --> 00:28:46.010]
See you.

[00:28:46.090 --> 00:28:46.330]
Bye bye.

[00:28:46.530 --> 00:28:47.190]
Wasn't she nice?

[00:28:47.330 --> 00:28:48.530]
That was like a breath of air.

[00:28:49.490 --> 00:28:52.530]
Like I said, like, now what is with this thing?

[00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:53.330]
Oh, I know what it is.

[00:28:53.470 --> 00:28:53.830]
I did that.

[00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:56.090]
I screwed it up because I did that little wah-ha thing.

[00:28:56.450 --> 00:28:57.670]
And I screwed this thing off.

[00:28:57.670 --> 00:28:58.650]
So it's my fault, honey.

[00:28:58.710 --> 00:29:00.010]
And I apologize profusely.

[00:29:02.150 --> 00:29:02.770]
Is that it?

[00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:09.490]
Oh, one thing about this DCS, man, when you screw with it,

[00:29:09.550 --> 00:29:10.350]
it screws right back.

[00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:11.970]
Kind of like you're in summer's.

[00:29:12.370 --> 00:29:13.950]
But she does have a great dance.

[00:29:14.970 --> 00:29:15.990]
They're good on you, guys.

[00:29:16.210 --> 00:29:18.730]
She talks to guys with lousy diction.

[00:29:19.170 --> 00:29:21.170]
Hey, honey, can I buy you a drink?

[00:29:21.690 --> 00:29:23.230]
Vinny Guido Joe.

[00:29:23.870 --> 00:29:24.110]
We did.

[00:29:24.370 --> 00:29:26.510]
Hey, Joey Dade, that's a me.

[00:29:26.910 --> 00:29:26.910]

[00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:29.650]
He asks, how do you come here off of us?

[00:29:29.650 --> 00:29:31.610]
What's the babe like you're doing in a balls up joint

[00:29:31.610 --> 00:29:32.090]
like this?

[00:29:32.090 --> 00:29:35.150]
Can I get you a drink on me?

[00:29:35.270 --> 00:29:36.230]
Hey, don't mind that.

[00:29:36.270 --> 00:29:36.990]
A sore on my lip.

[00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:38.930]
It's temporary, you know what I mean?

[00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:41.130]
Yeah, it'll go away.

[00:29:41.890 --> 00:29:43.230]
You know, you're beautiful, babe.

[00:29:43.810 --> 00:29:45.610]
I like that fish neck skirt.

[00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:46.230]
That's a beautiful.

[00:29:46.610 --> 00:29:49.310]
You remind me of my mom, you're a bloodshot eyes.

[00:29:49.570 --> 00:29:51.250]
He got to be now.

[00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:52.170]
Right back, sweet.

[00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:53.330]
You're just going to drain the drag.

[00:29:53.490 --> 00:29:54.570]
Where's his chinos?

[00:29:55.050 --> 00:29:56.270]
We're too tight.

[00:29:56.670 --> 00:29:57.650]
Oh, yeah.

[00:29:57.890 --> 00:29:58.650]
But don't all look good.

[00:29:58.650 --> 00:30:01.970]
It breaks out a lot of fifties when the jack comes.

[00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:02.990]
Yeah, I'm in the union.

[00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:07.030]
Then expects her to spend the night.

[00:30:07.470 --> 00:30:08.650]
What do you mean, no?

[00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:09.950]
What do you mean?

[00:30:10.270 --> 00:30:13.730]
That's she talks to Guido's.

[00:30:14.250 --> 00:30:15.290]
Come on, honey.

[00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:18.290]
They all have fancy gold chains.

[00:30:18.890 --> 00:30:19.990]
Come on, sweetie, I'll show you a bit more.

[00:30:20.090 --> 00:30:24.090]
Oh, yeah, that's she talks to Guido's.

[00:30:24.110 --> 00:30:24.830]
Come on, baby.

[00:30:25.250 --> 00:30:28.130]
I'll look and now, brang.

[00:30:28.130 --> 00:30:29.450]
Oh, you mean no, brang.

[00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:30.290]
Who said that?

[00:30:30.970 --> 00:30:31.170]
Hey.

[00:30:31.330 --> 00:30:33.890]
That's she talks to Guido's.

[00:30:33.890 --> 00:30:35.250]
Come on, let's point.

[00:30:35.710 --> 00:30:38.130]
That he's wise to get by.

[00:30:39.370 --> 00:30:40.790]
Hey, where are you?

[00:30:40.990 --> 00:30:44.990]
Oh, yeah, she talked with Guido's.

[00:30:46.030 --> 00:30:49.010]
That's she's always in the dream.

[00:30:49.850 --> 00:30:50.790]
Hey, honey, where you going?

[00:30:51.010 --> 00:30:51.870]
Come back, sweet.

[00:30:51.970 --> 00:30:52.790]
Shut up.

[00:30:52.970 --> 00:30:53.670]
God damn it.

[00:30:54.610 --> 00:30:55.870]
1242, a WI-DU.

[00:30:55.930 --> 00:30:57.850]
That's what Madden should have said when Wayne Hussie came

[00:30:57.850 --> 00:30:59.790]
in at Booth on that, that was really something.

[00:30:59.970 --> 00:31:01.230]
I think that was the first game of the year.

[00:31:01.290 --> 00:31:03.490]
Was it not, I believe so, first and second game of the season?

[00:31:04.910 --> 00:31:07.470]
And that in temperate behavior at a part of H Wayne,

[00:31:07.670 --> 00:31:09.550]
well, get your F&F-Stray.

[00:31:09.670 --> 00:31:11.090]
What a classy guy, you know what?

[00:31:11.430 --> 00:31:13.510]
What a classy guy, boy.

[00:31:14.550 --> 00:31:16.570]
See, these people, what really pissed them off

[00:31:16.570 --> 00:31:18.450]
is they are used, they're so used to people

[00:31:18.450 --> 00:31:20.330]
muckling under them because he's got a lot of money.

[00:31:20.590 --> 00:31:22.550]
And then we came along with our smart ass attitude

[00:31:22.550 --> 00:31:23.910]
and with the sisters who've got more money

[00:31:23.910 --> 00:31:25.130]
than Hill ever dream of seeing.

[00:31:25.430 --> 00:31:26.790]
And we said, poof to you, Wayne.

[00:31:26.830 --> 00:31:27.530]
And they don't like that.

[00:31:27.530 --> 00:31:28.330]
They hate it.

[00:31:28.330 --> 00:31:28.770]
They hate us.

[00:31:29.050 --> 00:31:30.130]
They hate it, et cetera.

[00:31:30.130 --> 00:31:31.810]
And that's pretty pissed off about it too.

[00:31:32.370 --> 00:31:33.130]
They're pissed off.

[00:31:33.250 --> 00:31:35.030]
That's why Wayne was sitting next to Brian Cox

[00:31:35.030 --> 00:31:36.870]
on the sideline the other night in that game.

[00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:38.470]
He was sitting right next to Brian.

[00:31:38.750 --> 00:31:40.210]
He said, Brian, you pissed off me.

[00:31:40.270 --> 00:31:41.050]
That I saw right there.

[00:31:41.070 --> 00:31:41.710]
It's all mine.

[00:31:42.050 --> 00:31:43.150]
I'm pissed off.

[00:31:44.210 --> 00:31:45.810]
Let's just get pissed off together.

[00:31:46.290 --> 00:31:47.110]
Oh, man.

[00:31:48.510 --> 00:31:50.330]
Or like you said in a bit, remember what it said

[00:31:50.330 --> 00:31:51.050]
in the beginning of network?

[00:31:51.150 --> 00:31:52.630]
The two old friends got properly.

[00:31:52.850 --> 00:31:53.910]
Now see, we can't say that.

[00:31:54.530 --> 00:31:56.910]
They got properly pissed off without the off.

[00:31:56.910 --> 00:31:58.330]
Well, if you're English, you can say it

[00:31:58.330 --> 00:31:58.910]
because it means drunk.

[00:31:59.290 --> 00:32:01.230]
Oh, they got properly pissed in the English style.

[00:32:01.390 --> 00:32:01.470]
Yeah.

[00:32:01.850 --> 00:32:03.670]
Well, there are a lot of English things that, uh,

[00:32:03.950 --> 00:32:06.690]
oh, as a matter of fact, I was, I'm glad you mentioned that

[00:32:06.690 --> 00:32:08.270]
because I was getting gas in my shell stage

[00:32:08.270 --> 00:32:09.830]
the other day and I'm staying, oh, what are you going to do?

[00:32:09.970 --> 00:32:11.690]
They noticed how they have those little, um,

[00:32:12.210 --> 00:32:14.250]
TV screens now where they have those stupid little,

[00:32:14.330 --> 00:32:16.490]
uh, they run little commercials while you're pumping it.

[00:32:16.550 --> 00:32:18.130]
I don't want to see no spots while I'm pumping it.

[00:32:18.290 --> 00:32:22.910]
But on the, on the actual nozzle, it says, do not top off,

[00:32:23.850 --> 00:32:24.170]
danger.

[00:32:24.490 --> 00:32:25.750]
Uh, uh, what does it say?

[00:32:28.810 --> 00:32:30.310]
Dangerous spillage may occur.

[00:32:31.010 --> 00:32:33.250]
And of course, you know, which spewage, uh,

[00:32:33.330 --> 00:32:35.950]
as in squirt, squirt because the British top off is like

[00:32:35.950 --> 00:32:38.550]
turning Japanese as Dr. Joyce Lennelders would say,

[00:32:38.610 --> 00:32:41.870]
that's math, debate and see, we have to list it because

[00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:45.290]
otherwise, uh, do not top off dangerous spillage may occur.

[00:32:45.550 --> 00:32:47.770]
So when you go to the shell station, definitely keep your

[00:32:47.770 --> 00:32:48.910]
hands on the, uh, nozzle.

[00:32:49.630 --> 00:32:51.330]
It's 1245 at WIOD.

[00:32:51.330 --> 00:32:53.010]
The holidays are here in good old ponytail.

[00:32:53.150 --> 00:32:54.890]
Jeff Cohen, who's just like a bad penny,

[00:32:55.110 --> 00:32:56.330]
keeps showing up over and over again.

[00:32:56.330 --> 00:32:58.150]
Jeff Cohen and the pizza loft catering,

[00:32:58.270 --> 00:32:59.650]
and division are back in action.

[00:33:00.030 --> 00:33:02.630]
They're ready to help you with your next office party,

[00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:05.210]
get together with ideas and the best tasting Italian specialties

[00:33:05.210 --> 00:33:08.130]
in town with prices as low as four and a half bucks per person

[00:33:08.130 --> 00:33:09.450]
and delivery anywhere in Dave County.

[00:33:09.630 --> 00:33:13.210]
It just makes sense to call Jeff at the loft during this holiday season.

[00:33:13.750 --> 00:33:14.370]
I was just there.

[00:33:14.470 --> 00:33:15.450]
It says, was I just there?

[00:33:15.610 --> 00:33:17.410]
Well, not that long ago, we remember it like it was yesterday,

[00:33:17.630 --> 00:33:17.830]
right?

[00:33:17.910 --> 00:33:20.690]
Ross, you bet, Jose and the food is still great.

[00:33:20.910 --> 00:33:21.370]
It's simple.

[00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:23.330]
When you're ready to step up to the flavor of great tasting

[00:33:23.330 --> 00:33:26.230]
at a, a trial in food, you're ready to step up to the pizza

[00:33:26.230 --> 00:33:26.490]
loft.

[00:33:26.630 --> 00:33:27.230]
Easy to get there.

[00:33:27.250 --> 00:33:29.770]
If you know where to look, just east of the Palmetto at the corner of

[00:33:29.770 --> 00:33:33.430]
69th and Flagler, for 19 years, Jeff Cohen and his personal weight staff

[00:33:33.430 --> 00:33:34.030]
have been doing it.

[00:33:34.090 --> 00:33:36.810]
They've been working hard, really, really hard to make sure you come back

[00:33:36.810 --> 00:33:38.570]
again and again and again and again and again and again.

[00:33:38.950 --> 00:33:41.630]
And recently, the mommy Harold said the pizza loft is definitely worth a

[00:33:41.630 --> 00:33:41.770]
drive.

[00:33:42.050 --> 00:33:44.090]
Well, why do they keep putting the same old stuff in his copy?

[00:33:44.210 --> 00:33:45.710]
I'm starting to get really parked off about that.

[00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:47.910]
Not much of a party tellers to lack of anything.

[00:33:48.910 --> 00:33:52.630]
However, the important thing is they'll be open new year's eve and new

[00:33:52.630 --> 00:33:53.270]
year's day.

[00:33:53.490 --> 00:33:54.050]
How do you like that?

[00:33:54.510 --> 00:33:57.990]
New year's eve, which is tomorrow night, Saturday night.

[00:33:58.290 --> 00:33:58.850]
Why are you nodding?

[00:33:58.850 --> 00:34:00.510]
Yes, tomorrow night is not new year's eve.

[00:34:00.990 --> 00:34:01.750]
Saturday night.

[00:34:01.970 --> 00:34:02.350]
What?

[00:34:02.610 --> 00:34:03.110]
I'm brand-aid.

[00:34:04.410 --> 00:34:08.150]
Like I said, they'll often be open Saturday night and Sunday, new year's eve and

[00:34:08.150 --> 00:34:08.790]
new year's day.

[00:34:09.010 --> 00:34:12.970]
So, spring into the new year, spring back, fall ahead, fall on this at the pizza

[00:34:12.970 --> 00:34:19.010]
loft called 2665111 69th and Flagler upstairs, if Jeff will, twist for the new year.

[00:34:19.010 --> 00:34:23.750]
Quick just with the doctor ordered, Marino and Montana.

[00:34:24.310 --> 00:34:28.670]
It's the NFL's premiere game this playoff weekend and you'll hear all the

[00:34:28.670 --> 00:34:34.730]
actions starting a noon Saturday on the Dolphin Express, Dolphins and Chiefs, Montana

[00:34:34.730 --> 00:34:38.050]
and Marino, D-Fo and Bocaper.

[00:34:38.770 --> 00:34:46.690]
Saturday, a news talk and entertainment radio, 16WYOD, 16WYOD.

[00:34:47.690 --> 00:34:49.750]
We don't let music ruin your fun.

[00:34:49.950 --> 00:34:50.930]
Neil, go!

[00:34:51.370 --> 00:34:52.350]
Yes, I am.

[00:34:53.450 --> 00:34:57.290]
Ladies, for the last three years, you've probably been wondering what happened to your

[00:34:57.290 --> 00:35:00.830]
favorite Latin Trubidor, Julio Iglesias, while he's gone to med school.

[00:35:01.250 --> 00:35:02.330]
And now...

[00:35:02.330 --> 00:35:05.430]
Two older girls I've a good love before.

[00:35:05.850 --> 00:35:10.150]
He's Dr. Julio Iglesias, OB-GYN.

[00:35:11.350 --> 00:35:18.610]
I've had you on your back, your feet up in the rack, two old-eggs I've gloves before.

[00:35:19.030 --> 00:35:24.670]
Dr. Julio Iglesias, OB-GYN coming soon to a clinic near you.

[00:35:24.750 --> 00:35:25.170]
Sports court.

[00:35:25.630 --> 00:35:26.810]
1249 at WYOD.

[00:35:26.930 --> 00:35:28.030]
How's Jake doing, by the way?

[00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:28.870]
How's Matt?

[00:35:29.210 --> 00:35:29.950]
Hey, Matt, how you doing?

[00:35:30.090 --> 00:35:31.910]
How's Shondo and having seen him at the track lately?

[00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:35.130]
I sure hope he didn't get absconded with by, you know who?

[00:35:35.730 --> 00:35:36.730]
On the fourth floor.

[00:35:36.730 --> 00:35:41.630]
We have an open line on the purple line at Pound IOD, excuse me, and went on the green

[00:35:41.630 --> 00:35:42.350]
line at 1-800.

[00:35:42.610 --> 00:35:43.770]
That's cellular one line, man.

[00:35:43.850 --> 00:35:47.170]
That's going to be the bone, the Bain of our existence in the future after Saturday.

[00:35:47.930 --> 00:35:50.050]
We're losing in case you join us late to Bell Soff...

[00:35:50.050 --> 00:35:52.030]
And we didn't just make this up, any of us.

[00:35:52.530 --> 00:35:56.710]
Bell Soff mobility is yanking in on us because they don't want to be associated with WYOD.

[00:35:56.790 --> 00:35:59.250]
They don't want us to have a Bell Soff mobility line.

[00:35:59.370 --> 00:36:00.690]
Couldn't we just have it and not say that?

[00:36:01.050 --> 00:36:02.610]
No, they don't want anything to do with us.

[00:36:03.070 --> 00:36:07.390]
They find us to be disgusting and grotesque and decadent and nauseating and perverted,

[00:36:07.390 --> 00:36:09.750]
which is what everybody out there likes, but they don't like that.

[00:36:09.910 --> 00:36:11.330]
So I say, put to them.

[00:36:12.010 --> 00:36:12.810]
Here is Dear Field.

[00:36:12.970 --> 00:36:13.150]
Hello.

[00:36:13.690 --> 00:36:14.130]
Neil.

[00:36:14.390 --> 00:36:14.590]
Yes.

[00:36:14.770 --> 00:36:15.210]
How are you?

[00:36:15.330 --> 00:36:15.590]
Great.

[00:36:16.030 --> 00:36:16.170]
Great.

[00:36:16.390 --> 00:36:18.150]
First time caller, long time listener.

[00:36:18.390 --> 00:36:18.750]
All right.

[00:36:19.090 --> 00:36:20.290]
Yeah, I got to tell you.

[00:36:20.490 --> 00:36:20.770]
Tell me.

[00:36:21.030 --> 00:36:21.690]
Three weeks ago.

[00:36:21.850 --> 00:36:21.850]

[00:36:22.370 --> 00:36:24.670]
74-year-old man runs a red light.

[00:36:24.830 --> 00:36:25.010]
Yeah.

[00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:26.370]
Total's my car.

[00:36:26.850 --> 00:36:28.110]
Puts me in the hospital.

[00:36:28.370 --> 00:36:31.050]
I see you for four days with five broken ribs.

[00:36:31.290 --> 00:36:31.470]
Yeah.

[00:36:31.470 --> 00:36:32.630]
And a torn spleen.

[00:36:32.830 --> 00:36:35.010]
Maybe Dick Pertons got Dr. Jack's phone number.

[00:36:35.070 --> 00:36:35.790]
It sounds like you're ready.

[00:36:36.030 --> 00:36:36.110]
Yeah.

[00:36:36.370 --> 00:36:39.530]
Well, I'm watching the Kansas City game and I'm telling them, don't give me the

[00:36:39.530 --> 00:36:39.810]
demo.

[00:36:39.950 --> 00:36:41.870]
We're all till five minutes into the fourth quarter.

[00:36:42.210 --> 00:36:43.670]
I had tickets for the game.

[00:36:43.750 --> 00:36:44.010]
Yeah.

[00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:45.570]
Neil, I got to go to the game.

[00:36:46.090 --> 00:36:47.050]
Can you help me out?

[00:36:47.910 --> 00:36:49.010]
Can you help me out?

[00:36:49.790 --> 00:36:50.810]
For old times sake.

[00:36:50.850 --> 00:36:51.290]
I do for old times sake.

[00:36:51.290 --> 00:36:52.470]
Remember the line in the Godfather?

[00:36:52.470 --> 00:36:53.650]
Is it can you help me out time?

[00:36:53.830 --> 00:36:54.590]
For old times sake?

[00:36:54.590 --> 00:36:56.230]
And Tom says, can't do it, Sally.

[00:36:56.890 --> 00:36:59.090]
We have an open line on the Rowered Line.

[00:36:59.090 --> 00:37:01.630]
Five, two, four, nine, four, six, three, one on a green line.

[00:37:01.630 --> 00:37:03.050]
But can I help him out with what?

[00:37:03.230 --> 00:37:03.890]
What is that man?

[00:37:04.050 --> 00:37:04.230]
What?

[00:37:04.810 --> 00:37:06.870]
I don't have tickets for the Kansas City game.

[00:37:06.910 --> 00:37:08.730]
The tickets that I do, oh, I forgot.

[00:37:08.890 --> 00:37:10.170]
I got Rick Riley's tickets right here.

[00:37:11.290 --> 00:37:14.670]
Seriously, if I don't have a call from Rick Riley by one o'clock, which is nine minutes

[00:37:14.670 --> 00:37:17.730]
from now and during the one to two hour, I'm giving away his tickets for the Kansas City

[00:37:17.730 --> 00:37:18.610]
to often game on Saturday.

[00:37:18.870 --> 00:37:22.970]
I am not going to continue walking around in this position of not having any idea.

[00:37:23.250 --> 00:37:25.010]
I mean, seriously, you talk about it and consider it.

[00:37:25.050 --> 00:37:26.830]
I know the guys on vacation, but he's in town.

[00:37:27.450 --> 00:37:30.810]
And he called yesterday, I put him on the air right on the heels of that poor woman with

[00:37:30.810 --> 00:37:33.210]
a daughter that his brain is bleeding all over the table.

[00:37:34.050 --> 00:37:35.990]
You know, and she wants to damn tickets.

[00:37:35.990 --> 00:37:36.790]
He wouldn't give it.

[00:37:36.850 --> 00:37:38.810]
He's a cheap skater is what he is.

[00:37:39.390 --> 00:37:42.710]
He wouldn't know a football from a Salami sandwich in this Rick Riley and all of a sudden

[00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:43.590]
he's a big football fan.

[00:37:43.830 --> 00:37:45.590]
Probably going to scalp him is what it's all about.

[00:37:46.350 --> 00:37:48.390]
Free loader, although he did pay for him.

[00:37:48.390 --> 00:37:48.770]
I'll say that.

[00:37:48.830 --> 00:37:49.510]
They are his tickets.

[00:37:50.810 --> 00:37:53.910]
But even so, like I said, the next eight minutes and twenty seconds, if he don't get

[00:37:53.910 --> 00:37:58.090]
on a stick, he's going to be sitting out there at the tailgate party on his tail.

[00:37:59.310 --> 00:37:59.870]
Here's Miami.

[00:38:00.050 --> 00:38:00.230]
Hello.

[00:38:00.690 --> 00:38:01.010]
Hello?

[00:38:01.290 --> 00:38:01.610]
Yes, sir.

[00:38:01.890 --> 00:38:02.050]
Yeah.

[00:38:02.270 --> 00:38:05.610]
I've never listened to you before and I've never called before and I'm really surprised

[00:38:05.610 --> 00:38:06.570]
at how good the show is.

[00:38:06.690 --> 00:38:06.950]
It is.

[00:38:07.090 --> 00:38:08.930]
What do you mean you're surprised at how good it is?

[00:38:08.950 --> 00:38:11.430]
Well, I mean, I never, you know, you think of A.M. you don't think of very good.

[00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:12.070]
Exactly.

[00:38:12.430 --> 00:38:14.830]
Here is a man who's got an IQ bigger than his member size.

[00:38:15.190 --> 00:38:16.470]
A.M. radio generally sucks.

[00:38:16.470 --> 00:38:17.490]
It's like a dinosaur.

[00:38:17.770 --> 00:38:18.670]
It's from the dark ages.

[00:38:19.010 --> 00:38:22.990]
And most people who are like living and breathing, which is the audience that we strive for, they

[00:38:22.990 --> 00:38:24.390]
don't even know from A.M.

[00:38:24.570 --> 00:38:24.650]
Right.

[00:38:24.810 --> 00:38:25.370]
How old are you, sir?

[00:38:25.790 --> 00:38:26.150]
16.

[00:38:26.550 --> 00:38:26.910]
16.

[00:38:27.230 --> 00:38:28.590]
And you've lived here all your life?

[00:38:28.730 --> 00:38:28.890]
Yep.

[00:38:29.130 --> 00:38:30.750]
And you've never listened to this station before?

[00:38:31.530 --> 00:38:31.890]
No.

[00:38:32.270 --> 00:38:32.910]
I haven't.

[00:38:33.330 --> 00:38:33.690]
Unbelievable.

[00:38:34.090 --> 00:38:34.370]
Yeah, I know.

[00:38:34.490 --> 00:38:37.290]
And I congratulate you on the stand and the dolphins because they really suck.

[00:38:37.370 --> 00:38:37.770]
They blow.

[00:38:37.950 --> 00:38:38.550]
They make me sick.

[00:38:38.690 --> 00:38:39.330]
What's your team?

[00:38:39.690 --> 00:38:41.070]
The team Washington Redskins.

[00:38:41.670 --> 00:38:42.370]
Oh, man.

[00:38:42.570 --> 00:38:44.010]
Well, I'll tell you one thing that the...

[00:38:44.010 --> 00:38:44.870]
At least they have integrity.

[00:38:44.990 --> 00:38:48.070]
That Gus Farat was exciting for a couple of weeks until he decided he sucked and they

[00:38:48.070 --> 00:38:49.330]
put his shoulder back and quarter back.

[00:38:49.390 --> 00:38:50.950]
But at least they had other little excitement there.

[00:38:51.210 --> 00:38:52.050]
And they did win a game.

[00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:53.470]
Right there at the end.

[00:38:53.650 --> 00:38:55.270]
Just what everybody was ready to bury them.

[00:38:55.270 --> 00:38:56.870]
They won a game, which was very exciting.

[00:38:57.470 --> 00:38:58.750]
Are you giving away those tickets yet?

[00:38:59.150 --> 00:38:59.950]
If I give them away?

[00:39:00.250 --> 00:39:00.390]
Yeah.

[00:39:00.810 --> 00:39:03.270]
You think that just because you called and sucked around, I'm going to give away tickets.

[00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:03.570]
I'm...

[00:39:03.570 --> 00:39:03.750]
Fuck around.

[00:39:03.930 --> 00:39:08.490]
I work in a fister and I'm a complacent high school student and I'm wondering if you've

[00:39:08.490 --> 00:39:09.510]
given away tickets.

[00:39:10.730 --> 00:39:13.610]
Yeah, but you just want to go there and root against the dolphins, which is almost enough

[00:39:13.610 --> 00:39:14.530]
to make me give them to you.

[00:39:14.910 --> 00:39:15.090]
Yeah.

[00:39:15.350 --> 00:39:16.210]
But I don't think so.

[00:39:16.310 --> 00:39:17.170]
But have a great new year pal.

[00:39:17.350 --> 00:39:17.630]
You too.

[00:39:17.770 --> 00:39:18.250]
Hang on tight.

[00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:19.790]
How do you like that?

[00:39:19.890 --> 00:39:20.570]
There's a good guy.

[00:39:20.570 --> 00:39:22.370]
Just see, I wish that...

[00:39:22.370 --> 00:39:23.330]
Now, who was it yesterday?

[00:39:23.330 --> 00:39:25.050]
He was telling me about the Terevella was a caller.

[00:39:25.630 --> 00:39:27.170]
Remember he was in a car and his kids...

[00:39:27.170 --> 00:39:31.150]
He had a bunch of kids as son and his friends from Terevella and they're all 14 years old

[00:39:31.150 --> 00:39:33.570]
and they said, turn on IOD and shut up because we want to hear Neil.

[00:39:33.930 --> 00:39:38.050]
See, the kids in this town, they love this show, but it's like another closet thing.

[00:39:38.610 --> 00:39:39.570]
It's a closet thing.

[00:39:39.770 --> 00:39:43.590]
And even those kids at Plantation High, including the one or two punks that stand on my street

[00:39:43.590 --> 00:39:46.610]
corner who are going to get really nailed after the new year, by the way, that one asshole

[00:39:46.610 --> 00:39:47.850]
that kid with a bicycle.

[00:39:47.850 --> 00:39:51.050]
I'm going to run his ass over and be proud of it and stand there and just look down at

[00:39:51.050 --> 00:39:52.770]
the body and do a dance in the street.

[00:39:53.210 --> 00:39:54.690]
But those kids love this show.

[00:39:54.810 --> 00:39:57.070]
Most of those kids are afraid to admit it though because then their friends are going to

[00:39:57.070 --> 00:39:57.890]
say, target.

[00:39:58.090 --> 00:39:58.730]
Stuff like that.

[00:39:59.030 --> 00:40:01.070]
And they probably are little packets anywhere their friends.

[00:40:02.630 --> 00:40:04.950]
So let me make a special dedication, by the way.

[00:40:34.950 --> 00:40:38.910]
I'm the big swish to Chesterfield Queen, new choice of the bags of America.

[00:40:39.030 --> 00:40:39.990]
Oh, it reminds me.

[00:40:40.090 --> 00:40:45.330]
I saw Jay Heiler in a parking lot this morning and I said, Jay, Jay, you're getting married

[00:40:45.330 --> 00:40:49.830]
to that needle nose bitch over there that Jessica Aguirre and he said, yes, I am.

[00:40:50.030 --> 00:40:51.650]
And man, there was a line behind him.

[00:40:51.650 --> 00:40:52.690]
I understand those seriously.

[00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:55.170]
We gave him a lot of heat on the show yesterday.

[00:40:55.170 --> 00:40:58.410]
I hear all the guys, especially the news guys, the Channel 7 are behind him.

[00:40:58.850 --> 00:40:59.730]
She wasn't wearing her engagement.

[00:40:59.730 --> 00:41:00.790]
Did you hear what I just said?

[00:41:01.230 --> 00:41:04.670]
I said, all the people who all the guys at Channel 7 are behind Jay.

[00:41:05.110 --> 00:41:05.470]
Closely.

[00:41:05.790 --> 00:41:06.350]
I heard it.

[00:41:06.490 --> 00:41:07.230]
Okay, what is it?

[00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:09.810]
She wasn't wearing her engagement ring all day yesterday.

[00:41:10.030 --> 00:41:10.470]
So we're safe.

[00:41:11.490 --> 00:41:13.190]
Thorth of the big diamonds.

[00:41:13.490 --> 00:41:15.730]
Maybe her girlfriend got up that just a joke, Jessica.

[00:41:15.830 --> 00:41:16.570]
It's just a little joke.

[00:41:16.590 --> 00:41:17.850]
You know how these rumors get started?

[00:41:18.730 --> 00:41:20.310]
Maybe Jay's boyfriend got upset.

[00:41:20.470 --> 00:41:20.830]
I'm sorry.

[00:41:22.270 --> 00:41:24.110]
Jay Heiler and Jessica Aguirre.

[00:41:24.130 --> 00:41:25.610]
That's like an Erica Strata marriage.

[00:41:25.810 --> 00:41:27.550]
That's like a David Cassidy marriage.

[00:41:27.810 --> 00:41:29.130]
Remember how long those deals lasted?

[00:41:29.130 --> 00:41:31.010]
Long enough for somebody to make a baby.

[00:41:32.470 --> 00:41:34.710]
Maybe Jessica can have Rick Sanchez's baby.

[00:41:34.950 --> 00:41:35.750]
Oh God.

[00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:36.870]
Man.

[00:41:37.570 --> 00:41:40.450]
One thing easy about his baby, they probably slip right out.

[00:41:41.250 --> 00:41:42.230]
Anyway, it's $12.55.

[00:41:43.450 --> 00:41:44.910]
You don't need any honey for that.

[00:41:45.130 --> 00:41:45.810]
Oh, geez.

[00:41:46.010 --> 00:41:46.410]
What a thought.

[00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:48.810]
Do you think he circumcised?

[00:41:48.930 --> 00:41:49.550]
I sure doubt it.

[00:41:49.850 --> 00:41:51.170]
Rick Sanchez, let's hope not.

[00:41:51.790 --> 00:41:53.230]
Let's go to a deer field.

[00:41:53.350 --> 00:41:53.530]
Hello.

[00:41:53.850 --> 00:41:54.410]
Hey, Neil.

[00:41:54.570 --> 00:41:54.910]
How you doing?

[00:41:55.030 --> 00:41:55.970]
Explain something to me.

[00:41:56.030 --> 00:41:56.410]
What is it?

[00:41:56.410 --> 00:41:59.690]
Now, I own two dogs, a German Shepherd Golden Retriever.

[00:41:59.810 --> 00:41:59.970]
Yes.

[00:42:00.310 --> 00:42:03.150]
And if one of my neighbors comes over and goes,

[00:42:03.550 --> 00:42:05.970]
Hey, you're a Golden Retriever, crapped in my yard.

[00:42:06.190 --> 00:42:07.910]
And I go, get your facts straight.

[00:42:07.990 --> 00:42:08.870]
It was a German Shepherd.

[00:42:08.970 --> 00:42:09.650]
What's the big deal?

[00:42:09.650 --> 00:42:10.250]
It's still crap.

[00:42:10.750 --> 00:42:10.950]
Right.

[00:42:11.110 --> 00:42:11.350]
That's right.

[00:42:11.490 --> 00:42:12.490]
Crap is crap no matter what.

[00:42:12.570 --> 00:42:13.510]
That's a very good point.

[00:42:13.630 --> 00:42:16.070]
And since he owns both teams anyway, the Marlins and the Dolphins,

[00:42:16.290 --> 00:42:17.230]
what differences does it make?

[00:42:17.370 --> 00:42:17.530]
Wayne?

[00:42:17.970 --> 00:42:19.130]
Yeah, that's what I don't understand.

[00:42:19.550 --> 00:42:19.930]
Butt head.

[00:42:20.350 --> 00:42:23.690]
Well, maybe someday we'll get our facts straight.

[00:42:23.850 --> 00:42:26.250]
I don't want to lay a heavy load on his

[00:42:26.250 --> 00:42:28.510]
agenda because there are a lot of other owners, but just keep in mind.

[00:42:28.510 --> 00:42:32.210]
He gave us the Dolph, he gave us the Marlins, he gave us the Panthers.

[00:42:32.210 --> 00:42:36.470]
And now both of those teams are in limbo perpetually and may never ever play again.

[00:42:36.750 --> 00:42:39.450]
You know, everybody was playing until Wayne stuck his finger in things.

[00:42:39.450 --> 00:42:42.670]
And from what we hear, he's one of the most adamant of the owners and a real major

[00:42:42.670 --> 00:42:44.410]
butt plug and detriment to any solution.

[00:42:44.450 --> 00:42:46.210]
And now we got no hockey and no baseball.

[00:42:46.210 --> 00:42:47.650]
So thank you so much, Santa.

[00:42:48.090 --> 00:42:51.750]
And don't forget, and all that Wayne, you did give us a crappy field that day too.

[00:42:51.990 --> 00:42:52.150]
Right.

[00:42:52.290 --> 00:42:52.830]
This is yours also.

[00:42:52.890 --> 00:42:53.750]
You suck Wayne.

[00:42:54.210 --> 00:42:55.290]
Have a great New Year, pal.

[00:42:55.290 --> 00:42:57.470]
Now, was that Bo Camper?

[00:42:57.570 --> 00:42:57.930]
I think so.

[00:42:58.050 --> 00:43:02.210]
Kim like sucks up to Wayne at the game, but on the air, you know, a different story when

[00:43:02.210 --> 00:43:02.870]
he's doing a voice.

[00:43:03.470 --> 00:43:04.070]
We have an open line.

[00:43:04.090 --> 00:43:10.810]
It's in Dave County 7519463 751 W I O D. Don't forget James, by the way, we don't

[00:43:10.810 --> 00:43:11.610]
aren't him to be lonely.

[00:43:11.670 --> 00:43:15.030]
He's over there by that Chevron station right, Kitty corner by Chris, Chris, Chris

[00:43:15.030 --> 00:43:15.350]
be cream.

[00:43:16.050 --> 00:43:17.950]
And that he gave us about 85 buildings.

[00:43:18.070 --> 00:43:21.510]
So if you can't put your finger on where he is now, just go back home and forget it.

[00:43:22.810 --> 00:43:25.910]
167th Street, 163rd, whatever it is, okay.

[00:43:26.370 --> 00:43:28.650]
And Northeast 6th Avenue there by that Chevron station.

[00:43:28.850 --> 00:43:32.430]
He's over there right now looking for a free ticket and peddling those Nebraska sucks

[00:43:32.430 --> 00:43:32.750]
t-shirts.

[00:43:33.070 --> 00:43:36.670]
And if we had any real hurricane fans in this town, see, that's the thing that I find

[00:43:36.670 --> 00:43:38.990]
very distressing about this town.

[00:43:39.830 --> 00:43:44.250]
And you know, being a Spartan myself and hating everything about hurricane sports as I do,

[00:43:44.470 --> 00:43:47.590]
I'm not going to pretend to be a bad wagon jumper there, but I will say this since

[00:43:47.590 --> 00:43:51.230]
allegedly everybody in this town, everybody within a hundred miles of it is now a big

[00:43:51.230 --> 00:43:52.770]
hurricane, bad wagon jumping fan.

[00:43:53.130 --> 00:43:55.970]
How come everybody doesn't show up at the Orange Bull on Sunday wearing one of those

[00:43:55.970 --> 00:43:56.970]
Nebraska sucks t-shirts?

[00:43:57.330 --> 00:43:58.250]
Then you'd have something.

[00:43:58.530 --> 00:43:59.750]
Then it's on national TV.

[00:43:59.810 --> 00:44:02.910]
The whole country is looking and get this tremendous kick out of this thing.

[00:44:04.710 --> 00:44:05.510]
Nebraska sucks.

[00:44:05.750 --> 00:44:06.590]
They bite the big one.

[00:44:06.650 --> 00:44:10.690]
They got these great t-shirts with a corn cob and a band symbol on the back and that EI,

[00:44:10.790 --> 00:44:13.090]
EI, and a back thing there with the musical notes.

[00:44:13.450 --> 00:44:14.410]
It's a beautiful thing.

[00:44:15.150 --> 00:44:17.710]
And you people, there are only ten bucks and it goes to center one.

[00:44:17.710 --> 00:44:21.030]
You ought to get out there and be buying like a crap loads of them from James right now

[00:44:21.030 --> 00:44:21.490]
as I speak.

[00:44:21.710 --> 00:44:22.830]
Get with it.

[00:44:23.030 --> 00:44:23.390]
Kendall.

[00:44:25.610 --> 00:44:25.970]
Kendall?

[00:44:27.230 --> 00:44:27.590]
Hello?

[00:44:28.810 --> 00:44:29.170]
Goodbye?

[00:44:29.670 --> 00:44:30.390]
Nobody in Kendall.

[00:44:30.550 --> 00:44:31.310]
What a bad break for them.

[00:44:31.410 --> 00:44:33.030]
I was just going to give them Rick Rally's tickets too.

[00:44:33.410 --> 00:44:36.310]
Open Line and Day, 751, WIOD, here's Coral Springs.

[00:44:36.530 --> 00:44:36.670]
Hello.

[00:44:37.050 --> 00:44:37.750]
Hey, Neil, how you doing?

[00:44:37.910 --> 00:44:38.070]
Great.

[00:44:38.530 --> 00:44:42.290]
The reason I'm calling up is a couple months ago we had our first experience together.

[00:44:43.230 --> 00:44:47.710]
I had called up about the satellite dishes that are out there.

[00:44:47.990 --> 00:44:48.850]
Squirt, squirt, yeah.

[00:44:49.030 --> 00:44:49.790]
Squirt, squirt anyway.

[00:44:51.050 --> 00:44:51.410]
And?

[00:44:51.990 --> 00:44:55.830]
And I was in the shower and I told my roommate, hold on, if Neil picks up the phone, you

[00:44:55.830 --> 00:44:56.890]
got to get me out of the shower.

[00:44:57.130 --> 00:44:57.290]
Yeah.

[00:44:58.050 --> 00:45:01.770]
The second I go in the shower, bam, you pick up the phone, I come running out, I got soap

[00:45:01.770 --> 00:45:04.430]
suds all over me, I'm naked, dripped and wet.

[00:45:04.730 --> 00:45:04.910]
Yeah.

[00:45:05.090 --> 00:45:07.310]
I just had to tell you that and he always had first experience.

[00:45:08.690 --> 00:45:09.050]
Yeah.

[00:45:09.230 --> 00:45:10.810]
You ever have an experience like that before?

[00:45:11.010 --> 00:45:11.430]
Not quite.

[00:45:11.430 --> 00:45:15.230]
But it sounds like you've been thinking about it long and hard since then though.

[00:45:15.310 --> 00:45:16.610]
A long, long and hard.

[00:45:16.730 --> 00:45:19.710]
I don't know how long or how hard, but a little bit of each I think.

[00:45:19.830 --> 00:45:22.130]
So what's this, you got against the hurricane fans?

[00:45:23.270 --> 00:45:23.610]
Phones.

[00:45:24.090 --> 00:45:24.430]
Phones.

[00:45:24.970 --> 00:45:27.670]
How about when they play one of those girls schools like Tampa, their long beach state,

[00:45:27.670 --> 00:45:29.970]
and they have like 20,000 people in the orange pool?

[00:45:30.630 --> 00:45:33.710]
Well, that's because all the locals and the locals, my auntie, locals from what I've

[00:45:33.710 --> 00:45:36.930]
always experienced, the local football games, they don't go to the dolphin games, they don't

[00:45:36.930 --> 00:45:37.830]
go to the hurricane games.

[00:45:37.910 --> 00:45:38.350]
The locals?

[00:45:38.790 --> 00:45:39.510]
The locals there?

[00:45:39.510 --> 00:45:42.650]
And how about before they started winning all these games last few years, how about when

[00:45:42.650 --> 00:45:44.810]
they used to have like 20,000 people in Notre Dame game?

[00:45:45.370 --> 00:45:47.190]
It's pretty much a synthetic fan base.

[00:45:47.330 --> 00:45:47.990]
You'd have to admit that.

[00:45:48.090 --> 00:45:49.190]
It's pretty much your make-believe.

[00:45:49.290 --> 00:45:50.950]
Well, the fan base is always up north.

[00:45:51.430 --> 00:45:51.850]
There you go.

[00:45:52.010 --> 00:45:52.650]
Look at the dolphins.

[00:45:52.710 --> 00:45:54.010]
Look who's coming down to the games.

[00:45:54.290 --> 00:45:57.930]
It's always people from all the New Yorkers threw it against them.

[00:45:58.030 --> 00:45:58.710]
Good point.

[00:45:59.570 --> 00:46:01.910]
Well, listen, go work yourself into a lather and have a great New Year pal.

[00:46:02.230 --> 00:46:02.650]
Times up.

[00:46:03.490 --> 00:46:06.450]
The radio station Wayne loves to hate.

[00:46:06.450 --> 00:46:08.750]
New's talk and entertainment radio.

I like it.

[00:46:54.270 --> 00:46:55.250]
Hey, butt heads.

[00:46:55.790 --> 00:46:57.050]
It's the one to do, hour.

[00:47:11.690 --> 00:47:19.030]
I can still remember the day when he went to town.

[00:47:19.070 --> 00:47:25.850]
So I'd be on the stoppin', the marvelous world around.

[00:47:25.850 --> 00:47:33.390]
We thought he was the greatest until we all got through.

[00:47:34.810 --> 00:47:41.130]
Now I'm on the stoppin', I'm on the stoppin', the stoppin' the way.

[00:47:49.430 --> 00:47:56.810]
A copy of Man from Jersey seeking fortune in the sun.

[00:47:56.930 --> 00:48:03.950]
He started renting movies, section 4, though he had none.

[00:48:04.950 --> 00:48:11.270]
We didn't split the two deal, he's gonna pay him a glass.

[00:48:12.230 --> 00:48:18.990]
Now I'm on the stoppin', I'm on the stoppin' the way.

[00:48:32.750 --> 00:48:39.790]
I heard Neil Rogers say it, I went to walk him on.

[00:48:40.290 --> 00:48:47.110]
I went to see the fans, I waited like the dawn.

[00:48:48.110 --> 00:48:54.670]
It's 100 degrees in half time, but I keep found no fear.

[00:48:55.910 --> 00:49:02.270]
I'm on the stoppin', I'm on the stoppin' the way.

[00:49:12.670 --> 00:49:13.070]
Oh!

[00:49:15.750 --> 00:49:17.050]
108 is W.I.O.J.

[00:49:17.070 --> 00:49:18.330]
There's no stoppin' him now, man.

[00:49:18.390 --> 00:49:21.190]
He's got his head full of craters and got a full head of steam.

[00:49:21.190 --> 00:49:23.210]
And he's just giving us all a little...

[00:49:23.210 --> 00:49:28.590]
Anyway, you know, if I could ask this one question, when I saw Brian and Wayne sit inside my thigh,

[00:49:28.590 --> 00:49:32.950]
all pissed off there at the game on a sideline, if I had one question to ask those two guys,

[00:49:32.950 --> 00:49:33.710]
it would have been...

[00:49:33.710 --> 00:49:35.230]
Have you guys ever seen each other's penis?

[00:49:35.530 --> 00:49:36.430]
But that would have been bad.

[00:49:37.010 --> 00:49:40.390]
Okay, then they'd really been pissed off, I think, probably knowing them sour-puss.

[00:49:41.130 --> 00:49:43.170]
Let's go and of course the answer might have been...

[00:49:43.170 --> 00:49:44.030]
Here's Hollywood, hello.

[00:49:44.390 --> 00:49:45.110]
Hey Neil, how you doing?

[00:49:45.230 --> 00:49:45.770]
Pretty good, sir.

[00:49:46.230 --> 00:49:47.670]
All right, it's the first time I'm calling a long time, listen.

[00:49:47.810 --> 00:49:48.130]
All right.

[00:49:48.530 --> 00:49:49.410]
So you pissed off, too?

[00:49:49.690 --> 00:49:50.870]
I pissed off, ain't you?

[00:49:51.290 --> 00:49:51.370]
I...

[00:49:51.370 --> 00:49:53.150]
Let's just all get pissed off together, man.

[00:49:53.310 --> 00:49:54.110]
I will pissed off.

[00:49:54.230 --> 00:49:56.470]
When Brian's pissed off, I'm pissed off.

[00:49:57.350 --> 00:49:59.850]
And he gets pissed off with the best of that Brian cock.

[00:50:00.610 --> 00:50:01.330]
Great show, man.

[00:50:01.630 --> 00:50:02.050]
Thank you, man.

[00:50:02.630 --> 00:50:03.730]
So you're giving away them tickets, man?

[00:50:04.110 --> 00:50:04.810]
Giving away what, man?

[00:50:05.230 --> 00:50:06.310]
Them two tickets to the Chief game.

[00:50:06.710 --> 00:50:07.450]
To the Chief game?

[00:50:07.570 --> 00:50:08.570]
The Chiefs, the Dog.

[00:50:08.570 --> 00:50:09.570]
The Chiefs game, huh?

[00:50:09.810 --> 00:50:09.910]
Yeah.

[00:50:10.010 --> 00:50:12.950]
That's what they call it when you wrap that little craft signal right around it.

[00:50:13.050 --> 00:50:13.850]
That's the Chiefs game.

[00:50:14.350 --> 00:50:15.530]
Don't wrap it too tight, Pally.

[00:50:16.210 --> 00:50:16.690]
Happy New Year.

[00:50:17.590 --> 00:50:18.770]
We have an open line in Broward.

[00:50:18.830 --> 00:50:22.810]
Yeah, I see the guy made a very excellent point there, and unfortunately I didn't think of it at the time to give it to him,

[00:50:22.850 --> 00:50:25.590]
because he sounded like, you know, a guy that would enjoy it and they tickets, too.

[00:50:25.590 --> 00:50:27.290]
I got him right here in my hand.

[00:50:27.450 --> 00:50:30.230]
And Rick Riley, I don't know, you know, you're really tempting the fates.

[00:50:30.530 --> 00:50:31.970]
You're really tempting the fates.

[00:50:32.010 --> 00:50:34.970]
I don't know whether the scream or culture key to banan at this point.

[00:50:35.410 --> 00:50:36.690]
What are we going to do about this?

[00:50:36.950 --> 00:50:37.910]
Remember the briefcase.

[00:50:38.630 --> 00:50:39.890]
Yeah, oh, that's right.

[00:50:40.010 --> 00:50:42.470]
This would be payback for that damn briefcase of mine.

[00:50:43.250 --> 00:50:44.070]
What an ass.

[00:50:44.210 --> 00:50:44.490]
You're right.

[00:50:44.590 --> 00:50:45.430]
He is an asshole.

[00:50:47.150 --> 00:50:48.030]
Oh, man.

[00:50:48.230 --> 00:50:49.750]
Rick Riley stole my briefcase.

[00:50:49.750 --> 00:50:50.730]
I'll never forget that.

[00:50:50.770 --> 00:50:51.470]
I go on vacation.

[00:50:52.070 --> 00:50:54.370]
I had a briefcase that had like my contract in it.

[00:50:54.370 --> 00:50:56.270]
And all kinds of personal stuff.

[00:50:56.790 --> 00:50:58.790]
And it was in like a broom closet in the other room.

[00:50:59.530 --> 00:51:02.070]
And he gave it away on the air that idiot.

[00:51:02.890 --> 00:51:06.390]
And then he gave it away to some more honestner who made copies of everything that's in there.

[00:51:06.430 --> 00:51:09.010]
Nothing, it was that big of a deal, but it just something you don't do.

[00:51:10.150 --> 00:51:11.290]
Where is that, by the way?

[00:51:12.110 --> 00:51:13.150]
Is it under Rick Sanchez?

[00:51:15.050 --> 00:51:16.630]
Because where is it under Dick Riley?

[00:51:17.450 --> 00:51:18.510]
It's under the Dick column.

[00:51:20.190 --> 00:51:22.170]
Where the hell is Rick Riley stole my briefcase?

[00:51:26.690 --> 00:51:29.990]
I like the part in his face.

[00:51:30.090 --> 00:51:30.350]
Okay.

[00:51:31.730 --> 00:51:34.710]
That's where he'd think what gives him the right.

[00:51:35.170 --> 00:51:39.070]
Oh, I think his wife what a bite it off tonight.

[00:51:40.250 --> 00:51:42.390]
Rick Riley stole my briefcase.

[00:51:43.530 --> 00:51:46.450]
What this grace to the human race.

[00:51:47.430 --> 00:51:49.310]
Oh, Rick, you're a smuck.

[00:51:50.010 --> 00:51:51.130]
Game over sucks.

[00:51:51.470 --> 00:51:52.150]
That's what I'm saying.

[00:51:52.150 --> 00:51:55.370]
We love meat should also include Rick Riley's butt.

[00:51:56.210 --> 00:51:58.850]
Rick Riley stole my briefcase.

[00:51:59.930 --> 00:52:02.410]
I like the part in his face.

[00:52:02.470 --> 00:52:05.370]
Hey, you know, Rick Riley, you're an asshole.

[00:52:06.490 --> 00:52:06.890]
Oh!

[00:52:07.610 --> 00:52:08.150]
Hey man.

[00:52:08.830 --> 00:52:09.770]
I don't know what to do.

[00:52:09.910 --> 00:52:13.670]
I hate to give away somebody else's goods, but like I said, he sure did it with mine.

[00:52:13.790 --> 00:52:15.770]
Although this in this case, I don't think I can give him back.

[00:52:16.950 --> 00:52:18.010]
But who cares?

[00:52:18.490 --> 00:52:20.210]
Anyway, let's go to a moral gable.

[00:52:20.210 --> 00:52:20.530]
Hello.

[00:52:21.530 --> 00:52:21.970]
Neil.

[00:52:22.230 --> 00:52:22.610]
Yes, sir.

[00:52:22.730 --> 00:52:24.930]
Hey, I'm down here visiting my brother from this place.

[00:52:25.090 --> 00:52:26.070]
It's called Tampa.

[00:52:26.410 --> 00:52:26.850]
Yeah.

[00:52:26.850 --> 00:52:27.550]
And up in Tampa.

[00:52:27.550 --> 00:52:28.070]
What a place.

[00:52:28.390 --> 00:52:29.530]
Yeah, they have this thing.

[00:52:29.730 --> 00:52:31.350]
I use that term very specifically.

[00:52:31.570 --> 00:52:34.510]
The thing called the Tampa Bay fucking ears.

[00:52:34.690 --> 00:52:35.590]
Rhymes with suck, yeah.

[00:52:35.730 --> 00:52:36.130]
That's right.

[00:52:36.270 --> 00:52:38.770]
And some people call it a football team.

[00:52:38.970 --> 00:52:40.870]
But see, I don't know what a football team is.

[00:52:40.890 --> 00:52:44.770]
You see, because they sure fall short of the definition that I am accustomed to.

[00:52:44.770 --> 00:52:48.810]
Well, if you ever seen Craig Erickson up close, fall short is the obvious term for him.

[00:52:48.810 --> 00:52:51.490]
And I was just wondering if you have any compassion.

[00:52:51.870 --> 00:52:53.810]
Tampa Bay blows.

[00:52:54.690 --> 00:52:55.090]
Yes.

[00:52:55.350 --> 00:52:58.570]
To someone to see a football game for the first time in their lives.

[00:52:58.610 --> 00:52:58.790]
Yeah.

[00:52:59.210 --> 00:53:00.530]
You would do me the favor.

[00:53:00.930 --> 00:53:04.050]
You know, the justice I would call the justice.

[00:53:04.410 --> 00:53:05.850]
Okay, don't forget the honey, junior.

[00:53:06.310 --> 00:53:07.630]
He's a virgin after all.

[00:53:07.730 --> 00:53:08.070]
Oh, I'm sorry.

[00:53:08.150 --> 00:53:08.470]
Is he gone?

[00:53:08.690 --> 00:53:09.690]
We have an open line in date.

[00:53:10.570 --> 00:53:11.370]
7519-463.

[00:53:11.370 --> 00:53:12.890]
And I see I don't have any tickets here.

[00:53:13.050 --> 00:53:14.590]
So quit the sucking around.

[00:53:15.770 --> 00:53:17.250]
Boy, you just joke around a little bit.

[00:53:17.250 --> 00:53:22.230]
I mean, other than these 708 pair for Saturday's game, I don't have any tickets here that are

[00:53:22.230 --> 00:53:23.150]
used to these people.

[00:53:23.670 --> 00:53:27.890]
And my pair on the 50-yard line for the AFC Championship game, which may not even get played.

[00:53:28.090 --> 00:53:32.110]
I mean, that would be a horrendous thing to toy the emotions and make you feel like you want something really,

[00:53:32.110 --> 00:53:37.950]
really important on the 50th of January right on the 50-yard line, two primo seats for the AFC Championship game.

[00:53:38.030 --> 00:53:40.370]
And then the dolphins, all of a sudden, rear up their ugly head.

[00:53:40.650 --> 00:53:44.210]
They're ugly, rear and lose a game like either Saturday or the San Diego game.

[00:53:44.570 --> 00:53:46.510]
And then you just wind their hold in your own.

[00:53:46.630 --> 00:53:47.250]
That would be bad.

[00:53:47.370 --> 00:53:48.790]
I would hate to do that to anybody out there.

[00:53:49.830 --> 00:53:50.930]
So quit sucking around.

[00:53:51.030 --> 00:53:53.310]
Quit begging already, man, it's getting embarrassing.

[00:53:53.550 --> 00:53:55.650]
I'm just humiliated and degraded for you.

[00:53:56.490 --> 00:53:57.690]
And by the way, did I say...

[00:53:57.690 --> 00:53:59.530]
Pup-pup-pup-pup-blows.

[00:54:00.010 --> 00:54:00.330]
Oof!

[00:54:00.370 --> 00:54:00.530]
Enough.

[00:54:01.750 --> 00:54:03.030]
Now, her show is also...

[00:54:03.030 --> 00:54:04.470]
Are we supposed to talk about this on air?

[00:54:04.590 --> 00:54:05.690]
I guess it really doesn't make any difference.

[00:54:06.130 --> 00:54:08.610]
Aaron Summers is also going to be on in Tampa and Orlando.

[00:54:09.670 --> 00:54:12.430]
So if you think that some of the colors were a little bit on the naive side,

[00:54:12.430 --> 00:54:14.150]
keep in mind that was strictly Orlando.

[00:54:14.830 --> 00:54:15.150]
Yeah.

[00:54:16.330 --> 00:54:18.130]
Where they just can't finger anything out.

[00:54:18.330 --> 00:54:21.430]
How can you finger anything out when all the fingers are in as in both nostrils?

[00:54:21.830 --> 00:54:23.510]
How can you get 10 fingers in two nostrils?

[00:54:23.650 --> 00:54:24.830]
That takes talent, man.

[00:54:25.290 --> 00:54:29.230]
When you've got all your fingers in your nostril, you have got some cereal talent, baby.

[00:54:30.270 --> 00:54:30.650]
Yeah.

[00:54:31.210 --> 00:54:32.890]
I can't finger it out, man.

[00:54:33.350 --> 00:54:34.730]
The nose is an erroneous one, you know.

[00:54:34.930 --> 00:54:35.150]
Yeah.

[00:54:35.650 --> 00:54:36.290]
It must be.

[00:54:36.650 --> 00:54:37.710]
Yeah, put the honey in your nose.

[00:54:37.870 --> 00:54:38.810]
That ought to taste really good.

[00:54:39.090 --> 00:54:41.390]
Then when you start looking in your fingers, baby, oh, delish.

[00:54:42.090 --> 00:54:44.690]
Ooh, it tastes like something good, but it's not.

[00:54:45.710 --> 00:54:48.650]
So anyway, it's 114 at WIOD.

[00:54:48.730 --> 00:54:50.470]
Speaking of stodheads, how's Mark Jacobson doing?

[00:54:50.570 --> 00:54:51.270]
He's a hell of a guy.

[00:54:51.370 --> 00:54:52.810]
I know he's a real whale of a guy.

[00:54:53.090 --> 00:54:54.150]
Now, that's Cox I'm thinking of.

[00:54:54.610 --> 00:54:55.630]
Not Brian Don.

[00:54:55.890 --> 00:54:56.970]
Don's pissed off, man.

[00:54:57.110 --> 00:55:00.390]
He has though pissed off that he never even sent me a check for a cent of one that Don Cox.

[00:55:00.490 --> 00:55:01.730]
You are such a cheap skate, man.

[00:55:02.050 --> 00:55:02.930]
You are such a phony.

[00:55:03.150 --> 00:55:06.370]
If you'd stop buying all that cheap wine and send me a check, we'd appreciate it.

[00:55:06.850 --> 00:55:09.650]
Anyway, Kendall Toyota is going to get a lot of imitators this weekend.

[00:55:09.650 --> 00:55:10.030]
That's right.

[00:55:10.130 --> 00:55:11.910]
They're print ads and radio ads from all the other dealers.

[00:55:11.910 --> 00:55:15.590]
What kind of sound like it looked like and feel like and smell like Kendall Toyota ads.

[00:55:15.670 --> 00:55:18.250]
But trust me when I tell you, they're just a shadow of the real thing.

[00:55:18.370 --> 00:55:21.770]
Beware, only Kendall Toyota is the world's largest Toyota dealer.

[00:55:21.890 --> 00:55:27.250]
And as a result, they go out and tell you that there is no dealings out float on any brand new Toyota that they can't and won't beat.

[00:55:27.590 --> 00:55:28.350]
They guarantee it.

[00:55:28.450 --> 00:55:32.670]
They guarantee that they will beat any legitimate advertised price from any other Toyota dealer.

[00:55:32.750 --> 00:55:34.230]
Or they'll give you that car for free.

[00:55:34.490 --> 00:55:36.090]
That's some serious balls, baby.

[00:55:36.170 --> 00:55:37.190]
That's some serious big ones.

[00:55:37.190 --> 00:55:40.390]
They guarantee if they can't beat it, they'll give it to you for free in the deal too.

[00:55:41.030 --> 00:55:44.610]
And only Kendall Toyota guarantees you at least four grand for any trade in regardless of age,

[00:55:44.690 --> 00:55:48.550]
conditioner mileage toward the purchase of any in stock select Toyota you pick out.

[00:55:48.890 --> 00:55:50.250]
Kendall Toyota, that's where it's happening.

[00:55:50.450 --> 00:55:52.070]
Don't waste your time and money any play sales.

[00:55:52.410 --> 00:55:57.670]
You'll find them on US1, just out the day later, call 1-800-873-T-O-Y-O.

[00:55:57.870 --> 00:56:00.590]
1-800-873-T-O-Y-O.

[00:56:01.490 --> 00:56:05.990]
Have you noticed a variety of team shows that have developed on 610-W-I-O-D?

[00:56:05.990 --> 00:56:10.590]
There's Zimpharin Mandage, Rick and Sud's D-Fo in Mandage, Phil and Margaret.

[00:56:11.090 --> 00:56:15.330]
So, to break with tradition, it's D-Fo Solo.

[00:56:15.930 --> 00:56:18.330]
All this week in the morning from 6-10 AM.

[00:56:18.930 --> 00:56:23.270]
Call it, ask him about nuclear physics or how to transplant tomatoes.

[00:56:24.050 --> 00:56:28.290]
D-Fo in the morning on 6-10-W-I-O-D.

[00:56:28.830 --> 00:56:30.510]
I'm going to sell my hand gold, baby.

[00:56:30.770 --> 00:56:31.550]
I'm going to get it.

[00:56:32.790 --> 00:56:36.950]
Tonight on ESPN, it's Leprechaun hunting with the NRA.

[00:56:37.410 --> 00:56:39.870]
Are you really going to shoot a leprechaun if you see one?

[00:56:40.070 --> 00:56:41.890]
You kidding? That's good, eaten.

[00:56:42.170 --> 00:56:43.690]
Oh, but isn't it inhumane?

[00:56:43.970 --> 00:56:46.690]
They don't feel it. Besides, it thins them out.

[00:56:47.130 --> 00:56:49.350]
Waf, we hunters weren't around in a couple of years.

[00:56:49.510 --> 00:56:51.390]
It'd be leprechauns everywhere you stay.

[00:56:51.770 --> 00:56:53.010]
Oh, not a solo.

[00:56:53.430 --> 00:56:55.350]
So, it's just another hunt to you.

[00:56:55.590 --> 00:56:57.850]
Well, there's one difference on leprechauns.

[00:56:57.990 --> 00:56:58.370]
What's that?

[00:56:58.370 --> 00:57:01.090]
Some of them shoot back.

[00:57:01.890 --> 00:57:03.650]
I'll stick the bunny rabbits.

[00:57:06.130 --> 00:57:11.110]
Leprechaun hunting with the NRA on ESPN right after bungee bowling.

[00:57:11.870 --> 00:57:12.750]
Don't be 50 dollars.

[00:57:13.150 --> 00:57:15.370]
118 at W-I-O-D. Happy Thursday to you.

[00:57:15.510 --> 00:57:16.850]
I could have left here real early.

[00:57:16.930 --> 00:57:18.850]
Got my paycheck before 10 o'clock this morning.

[00:57:20.210 --> 00:57:23.210]
Everybody is getting their crap together, getting their desk organized,

[00:57:23.470 --> 00:57:25.950]
making it look like they really got their garbage together.

[00:57:25.950 --> 00:57:28.230]
And they're getting ready for a long busman's holiday.

[00:57:28.490 --> 00:57:30.310]
So, what do you say we just take off tomorrow, George?

[00:57:31.850 --> 00:57:34.930]
In fact, you know what would really be a really great idea?

[00:57:35.590 --> 00:57:38.910]
Is if we played tapes tomorrow, I don't answer the door of the phone.

[00:57:41.170 --> 00:57:43.130]
Right, Rick? Rick!

[00:57:43.390 --> 00:57:44.110]
And I wet my pants.

[00:57:44.230 --> 00:57:44.870]
Yeah, you would.

[00:57:45.610 --> 00:57:47.430]
Because I got his tickets, baby,

[00:57:47.730 --> 00:57:50.530]
for the Kansas City Dolphin game on Saturday after the mid-four.

[00:57:50.850 --> 00:57:52.970]
It's Thursday after the mid-18 now,

[00:57:52.970 --> 00:57:54.330]
and the clock is ticking away.

[00:57:54.330 --> 00:57:55.050]
It's ticking.

[00:57:57.650 --> 00:57:58.390]
And nothing.

[00:57:58.810 --> 00:57:59.990]
Put a little air in summer zone here.

[00:58:00.090 --> 00:58:00.790]
Come on, let's...

[00:58:00.790 --> 00:58:01.810]
Yeah, I got it. I got it. I got it.

[00:58:01.890 --> 00:58:02.830]
I want to put it on one.

[00:58:03.330 --> 00:58:05.850]
Yeah, my boyfriend is bringing it up.

[00:58:05.970 --> 00:58:08.490]
And I promised him, like, a couple days of great sex.

[00:58:10.550 --> 00:58:12.170]
Bring the K-Y, Jelly Darlin.

[00:58:12.870 --> 00:58:17.510]
I was just wondering, like, what are some ideas I could have to do on him?

[00:58:17.910 --> 00:58:19.890]
Ooh, have you ever done a strip tease for him?

[00:58:20.550 --> 00:58:22.350]
Oh, okay. This is the way to go.

[00:58:22.350 --> 00:58:24.730]
I've had so much luck with this in my pants.

[00:58:25.130 --> 00:58:27.970]
Right, I'm going to pick out a good song that you like.

[00:58:28.110 --> 00:58:29.970]
Nothing real heavy, but cornwall.

[00:58:30.290 --> 00:58:31.510]
It's a bit of a lie, a lot.

[00:58:31.510 --> 00:58:33.590]
Kind of low down and dirty kind of thing.

[00:58:34.070 --> 00:58:35.810]
And what you can do is not to lose your dreams.

[00:58:35.810 --> 00:58:37.330]
I bet you got a low down journey thing.

[00:58:37.510 --> 00:58:42.350]
Now, pick out your music and practice this several times before you do it for him.

[00:58:43.250 --> 00:58:45.270]
And maybe have your clothes layered.

[00:58:45.930 --> 00:58:50.110]
You could start out with something even like a sexy little night robe and high heels.

[00:58:50.110 --> 00:58:51.330]
You take off the robe.

[00:58:51.770 --> 00:58:54.030]
You're going down to a sexy little nighty in heels.

[00:58:54.510 --> 00:58:55.650]
Take off the nighty.

[00:58:55.730 --> 00:58:58.330]
You could have a camel solo line with pretty panties.

[00:58:58.550 --> 00:58:59.890]
Ooh, I'm so lost.

[00:59:00.110 --> 00:59:03.730]
You got a sexy bra on with little panties now in your high heels.

[00:59:04.210 --> 00:59:05.870]
Take the bra off at that point.

[00:59:06.270 --> 00:59:09.070]
And then finally, let him take the underwear off you.

[00:59:09.170 --> 00:59:10.610]
I think you'll enjoy that immensely.

[00:59:10.650 --> 00:59:11.650]
I'm going to go see a good movie.

[00:59:11.810 --> 00:59:13.610]
Cindy, you're on real radio. What a 4.1.

[00:59:13.870 --> 00:59:14.330]
Hi, Erin.

[00:59:14.550 --> 00:59:14.910]
Hi, Cindy.

[00:59:15.490 --> 00:59:18.390]
I just wanted to compliment you on last night's show.

[00:59:19.010 --> 00:59:19.790]
Oh, thank you.

[00:59:19.790 --> 00:59:20.710]
It was really great.

[00:59:20.790 --> 00:59:23.510]
It gave me some good ideas, but my husband's got a town.

[00:59:23.510 --> 00:59:25.510]
So I have to wait until he comes back.

[00:59:25.590 --> 00:59:27.010]
You can do rock and butter self in the night.

[00:59:27.010 --> 00:59:27.830]
You can do a phone set.

[00:59:27.970 --> 00:59:29.050]
Yeah, rich for saying that.

[00:59:29.270 --> 00:59:30.270]
I've never done that before.

[00:59:30.810 --> 00:59:31.570]
Oh, boy.

[00:59:31.710 --> 00:59:32.310]
It's your husband.

[00:59:32.550 --> 00:59:33.450]
And it's my husband, yeah.

[00:59:33.610 --> 00:59:34.310]
Of 18 years.

[00:59:34.410 --> 00:59:35.210]
Oh, boy.

[00:59:35.350 --> 00:59:36.550]
There's nothing like phone set.

[00:59:36.690 --> 00:59:39.190]
When you call him, call him in the evening when you're nice and relaxed.

[00:59:39.550 --> 00:59:41.090]
Have a glass of wine dinner.

[00:59:41.410 --> 00:59:43.130]
Just a little romantic mood.

[00:59:43.430 --> 00:59:44.990]
Put on your sexy little night robe.

[00:59:44.990 --> 00:59:46.230]
A candlelit dinner by herself.

[00:59:46.230 --> 00:59:48.050]
To an iPhone sex with aubby on a phone.

[00:59:48.050 --> 00:59:49.490]
That's romantic, baby.

[00:59:49.570 --> 00:59:49.670]
Yeah.

[00:59:50.050 --> 00:59:51.550]
And just call him up and call you.

[00:59:51.550 --> 00:59:52.710]
What you're going to do with a candlelit?

[00:59:52.750 --> 00:59:54.690]
Cindy is, guess what I'm wearing.

[00:59:55.010 --> 00:59:55.210]
Yeah.

[00:59:55.430 --> 00:59:56.470]
Yeah, he'll love that.

[00:59:56.470 --> 00:59:57.270]
Will you turn this off?

[00:59:57.390 --> 00:59:58.630]
Please shut it off immediately.

[01:00:00.630 --> 01:00:02.310]
How about that Itsy Bitsy spider?

[01:00:03.850 --> 01:00:06.490]
No, seriously, that's the level that these last two calls.

[01:00:06.670 --> 01:00:08.430]
I mean, the other calls were at least titillating.

[01:00:09.470 --> 01:00:15.870]
But these calls were on such a juvenile first adoistripties and then like, oh, God.

[01:00:17.070 --> 01:00:19.670]
Okay, boy, then, girl, here, just look down there.

[01:00:20.030 --> 01:00:20.670]
Just look down.

[01:00:20.750 --> 01:00:22.970]
We'll low on your thing and you'll see something.

[01:00:23.130 --> 01:00:25.030]
Put your thumb right where you're known with you to be.

[01:00:26.050 --> 01:00:26.890]
It's going to be great.

[01:00:27.030 --> 01:00:27.810]
She's really dynamite.

[01:00:27.910 --> 01:00:31.690]
And of course, the reason that Steve Nichol hired her was because she's got a phenomenal ass.

[01:00:32.130 --> 01:00:32.910]
Here's my me lake.

[01:00:32.950 --> 01:00:33.230]
Hello.

[01:00:33.850 --> 01:00:34.830]
Hello, Neal.

[01:00:34.950 --> 01:00:35.170]
Yeah.

[01:00:35.430 --> 01:00:35.790]
God.

[01:00:36.150 --> 01:00:36.490]
Yes, sir.

[01:00:36.690 --> 01:00:37.670]
She's not even here yet.

[01:00:37.730 --> 01:00:38.410]
I'm sick of her.

[01:00:38.610 --> 01:00:41.890]
Yeah. Well, those last two calls kind of like turn my worm in the other direction.

[01:00:41.890 --> 01:00:42.630]
I'll guarantee you that.

[01:00:42.850 --> 01:00:44.790]
I'm sitting here waiting for you and I'm starting to do those off.

[01:00:44.790 --> 01:00:45.070]
Yeah.

[01:00:45.070 --> 01:00:45.950]
I'm turning me on.

[01:00:46.010 --> 01:00:46.410]
I know that.

[01:00:46.530 --> 01:00:50.290]
Well, in the beginning, it was a little more stimulating, but not to get, keep the women off

[01:00:50.290 --> 01:00:51.290]
the show is what I say.

[01:00:51.570 --> 01:00:53.010]
Keep out these frigid women offers.

[01:00:53.650 --> 01:00:54.470]
I have a problem.

[01:00:54.550 --> 01:00:54.950]
Need your help.

[01:00:55.110 --> 01:00:56.510]
That leaves all the women in this town out.

[01:00:56.510 --> 01:00:56.710]
Yes.

[01:00:57.510 --> 01:00:58.230]
I'm circumcised.

[01:00:58.590 --> 01:00:58.790]
Yes.

[01:00:58.950 --> 01:01:01.710]
I married a Brazilian woman who had a son already.

[01:01:02.070 --> 01:01:02.250]
Yeah.

[01:01:02.410 --> 01:01:03.650]
He's now my son.

[01:01:03.790 --> 01:01:04.650]
He's five years old.

[01:01:05.230 --> 01:01:05.990]
She has Brazilian?

[01:01:06.390 --> 01:01:06.650]
Yeah.

[01:01:06.650 --> 01:01:07.530]
I'm a fastie, Shupa.

[01:01:09.070 --> 01:01:11.230]
And what's the group, group, group, group?

[01:01:11.530 --> 01:01:12.790]
Remember that lady from Rick and Stud?

[01:01:12.970 --> 01:01:13.190]
Yes.

[01:01:13.430 --> 01:01:13.910]
She was Brazilian.

[01:01:14.490 --> 01:01:17.390]
In any case, my son's not circumcised.

[01:01:18.070 --> 01:01:18.390]
Why not?

[01:01:18.970 --> 01:01:20.590]
What are you some kind of a barbarian?

[01:01:20.970 --> 01:01:21.930]
First of all, human.

[01:01:22.290 --> 01:01:23.970]
Most people are country and not circumcised.

[01:01:24.690 --> 01:01:25.590]
But where's he born?

[01:01:25.990 --> 01:01:26.670]
He was born in Brazil.

[01:01:27.030 --> 01:01:27.990]
Oh, he's born in Brazil.

[01:01:28.130 --> 01:01:28.710]
And how old is he?

[01:01:28.790 --> 01:01:29.130]
84?

[01:01:29.750 --> 01:01:30.370]
He's five.

[01:01:30.730 --> 01:01:31.170]
Oh, five.

[01:01:31.310 --> 01:01:31.810]
No problem.

[01:01:31.930 --> 01:01:32.630]
Get it done, man.

[01:01:32.750 --> 01:01:33.710]
Well, I want to do it straight off.

[01:01:33.910 --> 01:01:34.470]
Get it done.

[01:01:34.470 --> 01:01:35.030]
I'll pour you.

[01:01:35.450 --> 01:01:35.770]
Don't.

[01:01:35.890 --> 01:01:37.470]
He's never been to a football game.

[01:01:37.570 --> 01:01:39.250]
You want to trade your hit circumcision?

[01:01:39.830 --> 01:01:39.970]
Yeah.

[01:01:40.270 --> 01:01:42.050]
I think George has got a point.

[01:01:42.210 --> 01:01:43.750]
Keep it, get the honey.

[01:01:44.390 --> 01:01:45.530]
We have an open line on the story.

[01:01:45.650 --> 01:01:47.550]
Didn't I just get you saying, stop sucking around.

[01:01:47.670 --> 01:01:48.730]
You're not getting any damn tickets.

[01:01:48.930 --> 01:01:49.530]
Stop already?

[01:01:49.990 --> 01:01:51.210]
Make it up to these silly stories.

[01:01:51.210 --> 01:01:52.850]
He's going to give me foreskin for the tickets.

[01:01:53.970 --> 01:01:55.030]
What did I tell you at the beginning?

[01:01:55.630 --> 01:01:56.070]
About what?

[01:01:56.690 --> 01:01:57.650]
Say you don't have anything.

[01:01:57.690 --> 01:01:58.690]
They still call and dub that.

[01:01:58.970 --> 01:01:59.290]
Exactly.

[01:01:59.770 --> 01:02:02.370]
If they even suspect that I got something that I'm going to give away.

[01:02:02.370 --> 01:02:04.090]
I don't know about mine.

[01:02:04.230 --> 01:02:04.390]
Okay.

[01:02:04.530 --> 01:02:06.210]
I'm not so sure about it for the AFC Chan.

[01:02:06.210 --> 01:02:07.270]
He wasn't talking about those.

[01:02:07.390 --> 01:02:08.290]
He's talking about Rick Riles.

[01:02:08.470 --> 01:02:10.410]
I'm not giving away somebody else's tickets yet.

[01:02:11.290 --> 01:02:11.650]
Yet.

[01:02:12.610 --> 01:02:16.910]
But I think I had a great idea there because I'm going to be like out of touch these next couple

[01:02:16.910 --> 01:02:17.210]
of days.

[01:02:18.150 --> 01:02:19.910]
This show just might be on tape tomorrow.

[01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:20.890]
You never know for sure.

[01:02:21.110 --> 01:02:24.770]
I might because George is already under the way today and I feel like something coming

[01:02:24.770 --> 01:02:25.030]
on.

[01:02:26.770 --> 01:02:28.630]
And I'm just going to be like out of touch.

[01:02:28.690 --> 01:02:31.190]
I might even check into a real fancy hotel for the weekend.

[01:02:31.190 --> 01:02:35.350]
You know, I'll kind of enjoy the sunshine and whatever else and be out of touch.

[01:02:35.470 --> 01:02:36.790]
Rick, you idiot.

[01:02:37.070 --> 01:02:38.090]
And I wet my pants.

[01:02:38.230 --> 01:02:38.970]
What a moron.

[01:02:39.110 --> 01:02:39.730]
He really is.

[01:02:40.070 --> 01:02:43.190]
See, this is the reason I feel uncomfortable with this whole deal on the first play.

[01:02:43.330 --> 01:02:44.730]
And anybody else would appreciate that.

[01:02:45.310 --> 01:02:49.410]
Why should I be put in a position in this delicate position of holding his goods?

[01:02:50.230 --> 01:02:54.370]
I think Boca Bryan oughta come down and get him and then he can go and knock on his door

[01:02:55.170 --> 01:02:56.050]
and get religion.

[01:02:56.690 --> 01:02:57.450]
Here's Palm Beach.

[01:02:57.630 --> 01:02:57.790]
Hello.

[01:02:58.070 --> 01:02:58.730]
Hey, that's me.

[01:02:58.970 --> 01:02:59.310]
That's you.

[01:02:59.310 --> 01:02:59.970]
Yeah.

[01:02:59.970 --> 01:03:00.170]
God.

[01:03:00.670 --> 01:03:00.970]
Yeah.

[01:03:01.030 --> 01:03:02.030]
I thought I'd never make it.

[01:03:02.110 --> 01:03:02.570]
You made it.

[01:03:02.750 --> 01:03:03.450]
Hey, you know what?

[01:03:03.690 --> 01:03:03.970]
Yeah.

[01:03:04.290 --> 01:03:05.250]
Let's talk about Mandage.

[01:03:05.750 --> 01:03:07.330]
The guy is a loser.

[01:03:07.790 --> 01:03:09.030]
What does that mean?

[01:03:09.210 --> 01:03:09.610]
He's a loser.

[01:03:09.830 --> 01:03:11.770]
He just annoys the hell out of me.

[01:03:12.170 --> 01:03:15.230]
Didn't you already call somebody else on the station to make all the same comments just

[01:03:15.230 --> 01:03:15.690]
the other day?

[01:03:15.810 --> 01:03:16.930]
Well, I don't make comments.

[01:03:17.130 --> 01:03:17.830]
I talk.

[01:03:18.090 --> 01:03:18.430]
I talk.

[01:03:18.670 --> 01:03:21.150]
Didn't you just talk to him and trash?

[01:03:21.470 --> 01:03:22.290]
Get out of here.

[01:03:22.950 --> 01:03:24.270]
Call him up and tell him he sucks.

[01:03:25.410 --> 01:03:28.830]
Don't be a, don't be a trashy, not old Jimmy Mad Dog man.

[01:03:28.890 --> 01:03:30.670]
It's even though what you say probably is true.

[01:03:31.150 --> 01:03:32.310]
Cut the crap, man.

[01:03:32.350 --> 01:03:33.110]
You jacked out.

[01:03:33.190 --> 01:03:33.390]
Yeah.

[01:03:34.190 --> 01:03:35.590]
See, there's a guy got nothing to say.

[01:03:35.650 --> 01:03:37.630]
Just wants to call here and stab somebody behind him.

[01:03:38.390 --> 01:03:39.690]
Backstabbing is easy, okay?

[01:03:40.370 --> 01:03:42.650]
Ripen somebody and ask after you've already hung up on him.

[01:03:42.690 --> 01:03:43.530]
Anybody can do that.

[01:03:43.590 --> 01:03:44.470]
You stupid turd.

[01:03:44.490 --> 01:03:44.990]
You moron.

[01:03:44.990 --> 01:03:45.490]
You idiot.

[01:03:45.590 --> 01:03:46.070]
Oh, is he gone?

[01:03:47.970 --> 01:03:51.130]
It's, uh, it's a lot of fun though.

[01:03:51.170 --> 01:03:51.630]
It really is.

[01:03:51.950 --> 01:03:53.270]
You should be honest, and it's really great.

[01:03:53.270 --> 01:03:56.610]
By the way, don't forget, peaches, music and videos got our best

[01:03:56.610 --> 01:03:59.390]
of Rick and Suds and Phil Henry and Neil Roger CDs and cassettes.

[01:03:59.690 --> 01:04:02.330]
All the peaches outlets all over Dave Rowerton, Palm Beach like

[01:04:03.510 --> 01:04:05.030]
1500 sunrise and four-loader day.

[01:04:05.030 --> 01:04:06.010]
That's the original peaches.

[01:04:06.050 --> 01:04:09.070]
They prestigious original one there, not too far from Il Milino.

[01:04:09.930 --> 01:04:13.990]
And at 11 South University in plantation, not too far from Il Milino.

[01:04:14.510 --> 01:04:19.270]
And at 6605 South Dixie Highway, 1390 Northeast, 163rd North Miami Beach,

[01:04:19.890 --> 01:04:21.950]
2408 Oak and Chobie Boulevard in West Palm Beach,

[01:04:21.950 --> 01:04:24.570]
and 1371 Palm Itta Park Road West in Boka.

[01:04:24.710 --> 01:04:26.870]
Those are the, uh, those are the, uh, places.

[01:04:27.010 --> 01:04:27.530]
That's the thing.

[01:04:27.710 --> 01:04:28.290]
That's them.

[01:04:28.450 --> 01:04:29.030]
Them be it.

[01:04:29.290 --> 01:04:29.650]
Peaches.

[01:04:30.510 --> 01:04:33.050]
And we got about 84 grand for Santa Juan so far.

[01:04:33.110 --> 01:04:34.790]
So we've really last, uh, 10 days or so.

[01:04:34.910 --> 01:04:37.770]
We really picked up some momentum and we got through January 31st.

[01:04:37.790 --> 01:04:39.970]
So let's go out there and don't forget, James, the then their

[01:04:39.970 --> 01:04:40.950]
prominent at Chevron.

[01:04:41.250 --> 01:04:43.910]
Go out there and, uh, relieve him of some of those Nebraska Sucks T-shirts.

[01:04:43.970 --> 01:04:44.810]
Please relieve him.

[01:04:45.750 --> 01:04:47.030]
Here is a four-loader day.

[01:04:47.030 --> 01:04:47.230]
Hello.

[01:04:47.670 --> 01:04:47.890]
Neil.

[01:04:48.150 --> 01:04:48.290]
Yeah.

[01:04:48.630 --> 01:04:49.390]
Mr. Nine and nine.

[01:04:49.390 --> 01:04:50.970]
I think George said that wasn't bored.

[01:04:51.390 --> 01:04:52.390]
He said you weren't bored.

[01:04:52.490 --> 01:04:52.870]
He was wrong.

[01:04:53.250 --> 01:04:55.190]
Let's go to a lady in North Miami.

[01:04:55.190 --> 01:04:55.530]
Hello.

[01:04:55.890 --> 01:04:56.410]
Hello, Neil.

[01:04:56.410 --> 01:04:57.350]
I can't take him anymore.

[01:04:57.550 --> 01:04:58.530]
He's, he's so chronic.

[01:04:58.810 --> 01:04:59.230]
What is it?

[01:04:59.510 --> 01:05:00.830]
Hello, Neil, my king and queen.

[01:05:01.030 --> 01:05:01.250]
How are you?

[01:05:01.490 --> 01:05:01.490]

[01:05:01.570 --> 01:05:01.790]
Okay.

[01:05:02.390 --> 01:05:02.870]
That's good.

[01:05:03.170 --> 01:05:06.910]
Uh, I just wanted to make a comment about that, uh, phone six things.

[01:05:06.990 --> 01:05:07.410]
That's so ridiculous.

[01:05:07.750 --> 01:05:12.830]
What happens if a woman is like real rotund and fat and spanky and smelly and she's

[01:05:12.830 --> 01:05:14.250]
going to do a strip piece for her husband?

[01:05:14.370 --> 01:05:15.070]
There you go.

[01:05:15.370 --> 01:05:15.890]
That's disgusting.

[01:05:15.890 --> 01:05:19.190]
And that's probably the one, the woman that was calling her probably weighed like 700

[01:05:19.190 --> 01:05:23.610]
pounds just got in from one of those fat clinics off of the appearance on a

[01:05:23.610 --> 01:05:24.230]
Horolo show.

[01:05:24.630 --> 01:05:28.770]
They squeezed her ass with a shoehorn inside the door and she's going to do a strip for her

[01:05:28.770 --> 01:05:29.110]
husband.

[01:05:29.330 --> 01:05:29.650]
Exactly.

[01:05:29.950 --> 01:05:31.650]
Like generic responses.

[01:05:31.810 --> 01:05:33.070]
Oh, this will be good for middle America.

[01:05:33.150 --> 01:05:35.650]
Well, middle America is mostly overweight.

[01:05:35.910 --> 01:05:36.650]
So that's right.

[01:05:36.890 --> 01:05:37.290]
That's right.

[01:05:37.350 --> 01:05:39.770]
And that thing about the phone sex, I'm going to say it again.

[01:05:39.890 --> 01:05:40.130]
Okay.

[01:05:40.410 --> 01:05:42.910]
And I don't make judgments, but I have opinions.

[01:05:42.910 --> 01:05:43.550]
There's a difference.

[01:05:43.550 --> 01:05:47.710]
I mean, if you want to do that fine, but all these people, especially these guys with these 900

[01:05:47.710 --> 01:05:52.710]
numbers that are having, uh, so-called phone sex with some erotic sounding voice in

[01:05:52.710 --> 01:05:56.630]
the other end, they're lost to somebody who weighs three times as much as the woman that we just described.

[01:05:57.070 --> 01:06:01.790]
I mean, what is this all that is beyond desperation, even a good plastic blow up doll or something tangible

[01:06:01.790 --> 01:06:04.690]
as opposed to a voice on the other end of a phone line?

[01:06:04.750 --> 01:06:05.230]
Of course.

[01:06:05.530 --> 01:06:05.770]
God.

[01:06:05.970 --> 01:06:06.410]
Absolutely.

[01:06:06.670 --> 01:06:09.730]
Like somebody making love to a breast that's just not not attached to anything.

[01:06:09.830 --> 01:06:10.290]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:06:10.450 --> 01:06:10.710]
Absolutely.

[01:06:11.390 --> 01:06:12.350]
That's really ridiculous.

[01:06:12.350 --> 01:06:12.910]
It is.

[01:06:13.090 --> 01:06:15.090]
Um, I also want to point out that-

[01:06:15.090 --> 01:06:17.250]
You know what she probably owns a few of those 900 lines.

[01:06:17.250 --> 01:06:18.170]
She's probably trying to-

[01:06:18.170 --> 01:06:18.730]
Oh, you're-

[01:06:18.730 --> 01:06:20.570]
To jack up some business or something.

[01:06:20.810 --> 01:06:20.810]

[01:06:20.850 --> 01:06:21.830]
It's got to be something.

[01:06:21.950 --> 01:06:22.090]
Yeah.

[01:06:22.370 --> 01:06:27.410]
Also, I want to point out, sir, that I am not a snore, nor have no desire to start.

[01:06:27.770 --> 01:06:31.030]
So ask, can you put some myelin's tickets like that idiot yesterday?

[01:06:31.110 --> 01:06:32.990]
Yeah, she wants marlins tickets in the orange door.

[01:06:33.130 --> 01:06:33.490]
Made with-

[01:06:33.490 --> 01:06:34.410]
Made me embarrassed.

[01:06:34.790 --> 01:06:35.190]
Nauseating.

[01:06:35.890 --> 01:06:36.590]
Disgusting bitch.

[01:06:37.010 --> 01:06:38.890]
I also wanted to ask you what the heck happened.

[01:06:38.890 --> 01:06:44.770]
And I mean, I know if there's anything to do with the people that were using the Bell South mobility line,

[01:06:44.890 --> 01:06:45.510]
was what-

[01:06:45.510 --> 01:06:47.830]
Why did they just say that they want to cut it off, Neil?

[01:06:48.030 --> 01:06:48.410]
No, they-

[01:06:48.410 --> 01:06:50.710]
Bell South mobility don't want nothing to do with WIOD.

[01:06:50.830 --> 01:06:53.490]
We're just too controversial and too outrageous and too-

[01:06:53.490 --> 01:06:54.230]
Whatever we are.

[01:06:54.570 --> 01:06:55.230]
And they just-

[01:06:55.230 --> 01:06:56.370]
They're too goody-touches.

[01:06:56.490 --> 01:06:57.550]
They don't want nothing to do with us.

[01:06:57.650 --> 01:06:58.150]
Oh, they can-

[01:06:58.150 --> 01:07:00.030]
So they can kiss my fan-ass is what they can do.

[01:07:00.090 --> 01:07:00.650]
They can go to hell.

[01:07:00.970 --> 01:07:01.330]
I'll call-

[01:07:01.330 --> 01:07:01.810]
They suck.

[01:07:02.090 --> 01:07:03.270]
I'll call you if it-

[01:07:03.270 --> 01:07:04.070]
If it has-

[01:07:04.070 --> 01:07:04.390]
And that-

[01:07:04.390 --> 01:07:08.790]
And that problem I just got over having with them on that cell phone that I talked about where somebody got a hold of them.

[01:07:08.790 --> 01:07:10.230]
And I'm working on all those illegal charges.

[01:07:10.450 --> 01:07:10.530]
Right.

[01:07:10.610 --> 01:07:11.010]
I'm carrying-

[01:07:11.010 --> 01:07:13.510]
As soon as I get home today, I'm having that phone shut off permanently.

[01:07:13.910 --> 01:07:14.450]
And never-

[01:07:14.450 --> 01:07:14.830]
No, I won't.

[01:07:14.930 --> 01:07:16.450]
I will never use Bell South mobility again.

[01:07:16.630 --> 01:07:17.190]
They can go to hell.

[01:07:17.610 --> 01:07:17.890]
Wow.

[01:07:18.050 --> 01:07:18.950]
They can kiss my ass.

[01:07:19.270 --> 01:07:19.870]
I don't blame you.

[01:07:20.730 --> 01:07:22.310]
Also, sir, I'd like to make a-

[01:07:22.310 --> 01:07:24.190]
I can't help making a parallel, you know?

[01:07:24.270 --> 01:07:26.910]
I keep hearing the way where everyone's talking about Shula.

[01:07:27.390 --> 01:07:28.110]
And I can't-

[01:07:28.110 --> 01:07:32.790]
I can't help make that parallel between, you know, Mike and Philoxo eating at Louise and-

[01:07:33.290 --> 01:07:34.210]
Philoxo says to Mike,

[01:07:34.790 --> 01:07:37.630]
Well, uh, face it, uh, the dawn is slipping.

[01:07:37.630 --> 01:07:38.810]
Yes, son of a-

[01:07:38.810 --> 01:07:38.890]
No, no.

[01:07:39.750 --> 01:07:42.330]
So it's like, you know, pretty obvious what that's all about.

[01:07:42.450 --> 01:07:43.190]
The dawn is slipping.

[01:07:43.330 --> 01:07:43.670]
He is.

[01:07:43.830 --> 01:07:44.150]
Big time.

[01:07:44.310 --> 01:07:45.830]
On a banana peel, that's why he's on the card.

[01:07:46.390 --> 01:07:47.330]
Well, have a happy new year.

[01:07:47.490 --> 01:07:49.530]
Oh, I want one more thing I want to ask you, Neil.

[01:07:49.590 --> 01:07:49.850]
Yes.

[01:07:50.010 --> 01:07:52.330]
Remember, I called about a year ago and I asked you-

[01:07:52.330 --> 01:07:52.650]
Oh, sure.

[01:07:52.970 --> 01:07:55.030]
Did you ever watch the-

[01:07:55.610 --> 01:07:57.670]
Godfather again after I asked you that-

[01:07:57.670 --> 01:08:04.790]
That shot right before Luca gets to sleep with the fishes and he's in the bar with Topalia and Philoxo

[01:08:04.790 --> 01:08:07.550]
and they chop off his finger right before the shot.

[01:08:07.650 --> 01:08:08.830]
They don't chop off his finger.

[01:08:08.830 --> 01:08:10.350]
He stabs the knife through his hand.

[01:08:10.450 --> 01:08:10.910]
I mean, Luca.

[01:08:11.350 --> 01:08:12.470]
All right, that Luca, they-

[01:08:12.470 --> 01:08:13.490]
They're right, they stab the finger.

[01:08:13.490 --> 01:08:14.350]
I'll take you to Luca.

[01:08:15.090 --> 01:08:15.270]
Yeah.

[01:08:15.670 --> 01:08:17.970]
Sorry, I'm getting all nervous about that here.

[01:08:18.430 --> 01:08:18.430]

[01:08:18.430 --> 01:08:23.130]
But the thing is, right before the shot, Neil, they have this shot where they're showing-

[01:08:23.130 --> 01:08:29.710]
they're showing inside the bar and you see this, uh, this like frosted glass with like two fish in it.

[01:08:29.950 --> 01:08:34.390]
And it's, uh, like a foreshadowing that, you know, that he will be sleeping with the fish.

[01:08:34.390 --> 01:08:35.190]
It's a very good point.

[01:08:35.410 --> 01:08:36.130]
Yeah, yeah.

[01:08:36.150 --> 01:08:37.210]
And then you have to see it.

[01:08:37.210 --> 01:08:41.330]
Like later on where they're standing in the, uh, where, uh, Don Corleone is sitting on a chair.

[01:08:41.950 --> 01:08:42.050]
Right.

[01:08:42.130 --> 01:08:45.850]
And Tom Hagen says, but maybe I could help when they're gonna make the move to Vegas and you're out top.

[01:08:46.010 --> 01:08:46.050]
Right.

[01:08:46.050 --> 01:08:47.730]
And they're sitting with a big aquarium there.

[01:08:48.030 --> 01:08:48.570]
That's right.

[01:08:48.810 --> 01:08:50.750]
So I think that there are a lot of people sleep with the fishes.

[01:08:50.890 --> 01:08:52.090]
I think you got your finger on it.

[01:08:52.210 --> 01:08:53.110]
I think you can get one.

[01:08:53.110 --> 01:08:54.170]
Have a great new year, say goodbye.

[01:08:54.430 --> 01:08:56.390]
I'm gonna leave you go now because I know you're up here.

[01:08:56.410 --> 01:08:56.810]
Yeah, I'm busy.

[01:08:56.910 --> 01:08:57.870]
Okay, get out of here, Luca.

[01:08:57.970 --> 01:08:58.890]
Lucille La Bratzi.

[01:08:59.610 --> 01:09:00.890]
We have an open line in date.

[01:09:02.170 --> 01:09:02.890]
751-9463.

[01:09:02.990 --> 01:09:05.270]
But may your first daughter be a masculine child.

[01:09:05.490 --> 01:09:10.070]
I mean, so how's Jessica Giri doing with a new husband to be a J-hiler?

[01:09:11.310 --> 01:09:11.670]
Huh?

[01:09:11.850 --> 01:09:13.550]
They don't come any viler than J-hiler.

[01:09:13.690 --> 01:09:15.310]
And those guys, they're lined up behind him.

[01:09:15.570 --> 01:09:19.470]
We're all behind him at Channel 7 and he's getting pretty nervous about it too, especially the paper boy.

[01:09:19.830 --> 01:09:20.990]
Wow, he's first in line.

[01:09:22.510 --> 01:09:23.770]
Don't drop this hope, J.

[01:09:23.950 --> 01:09:24.370]
Oh, sorry.

[01:09:25.230 --> 01:09:26.090]
Anyway, it's 130.

[01:09:28.270 --> 01:09:30.830]
Oh, man, you think the only fruit cakes are a Christmas time, huh?

[01:09:30.830 --> 01:09:32.410]
130 at WIOD.

[01:09:32.870 --> 01:09:35.130]
16 WIOD.

[01:09:35.650 --> 01:09:39.390]
If your boss won't let you listen at work, file discrimination charges.

[01:09:39.790 --> 01:09:47.730]
Last year, more than 19,000 Americans were involved in auto accidents because they were momentarily distracted while picking their noses.

[01:09:49.070 --> 01:09:50.710]
It's a medical fact.

[01:09:51.130 --> 01:09:57.290]
When your index finger is burrowing into your nostril past the first knuckle, you can't concentrate and you sure can't drive.

[01:09:57.290 --> 01:10:03.790]
Your auto club recommends that you appoint someone in your carpool as your personal designated nose picker.

[01:10:04.030 --> 01:10:12.310]
If you don't belong to a carpool, ask a close friend or relative to give you a hand or call your local auto club, we'll be happy to appoint one for you.

[01:10:12.590 --> 01:10:15.890]
In the meantime, keep your hands and your fingers on the wheel.

[01:10:16.490 --> 01:10:17.050]
Damn it.

[01:10:17.450 --> 01:10:18.350]
We can't find a right one.

[01:10:18.450 --> 01:10:20.030]
Maybe Luke Alphan will help us out, okay?

[01:10:20.410 --> 01:10:26.910]
In fact, you know, the rumor has it that the people in Michigan are so upset about the dolphins being the lion sitting at that they've abandoned.

[01:10:26.910 --> 01:10:30.110]
I'm not even flipper from all the cable channels over there. I should have asked Dick if that was true or not.

[01:10:30.730 --> 01:10:33.030]
You can't put a band Sandy in Michigan, man.

[01:10:34.050 --> 01:10:35.030]
Sandy is where it's at.

[01:10:35.190 --> 01:10:36.090]
How's Luke doing, by the way?

[01:10:36.110 --> 01:10:37.090]
Is he going to be on a show next week?

[01:10:37.450 --> 01:10:38.310]
Here's Kendall. Hello.

[01:10:38.650 --> 01:10:39.110]
Hey, Neil.

[01:10:39.390 --> 01:10:39.690]
How you doing?

[01:10:39.850 --> 01:10:40.750]
Come on.

[01:10:42.650 --> 01:10:42.970]
Yes?

[01:10:43.130 --> 01:10:45.890]
I'm not asking for a ticket because I'm already going to the game on Saturday.

[01:10:45.990 --> 01:10:46.510]
Good. All right.

[01:10:46.830 --> 01:10:47.690]
I don't even need to start.

[01:10:47.950 --> 01:10:49.090]
I don't even want to even talk with the ticket.

[01:10:49.110 --> 01:10:50.750]
Don't have to be defensive. There are no tickets.

[01:10:50.950 --> 01:10:52.310]
That's right. I don't care about them.

[01:10:53.050 --> 01:10:55.070]
However, I do want to mention one thing.

[01:10:56.650 --> 01:10:57.790]
I'm waiting for that one.

[01:10:57.890 --> 01:10:58.030]
But.

[01:10:58.350 --> 01:10:58.350]

[01:10:58.970 --> 01:10:58.970]

[01:10:59.330 --> 01:10:59.490]
But.

[01:11:01.690 --> 01:11:02.310]
What is it?

[01:11:02.410 --> 01:11:02.690]
A.C.

[01:11:02.790 --> 01:11:04.530]
Jam, you know what not a possible thing?

[01:11:04.910 --> 01:11:05.710]
What about it?

[01:11:05.790 --> 01:11:06.470]
You just got through St.

[01:11:06.570 --> 01:11:07.670]
You're working ask for any tickets.

[01:11:07.770 --> 01:11:09.670]
Oh, it was this week I was going to get out of here.

[01:11:10.350 --> 01:11:11.310]
You sack a crap.

[01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:14.910]
I'm. I'm a serious.

[01:11:15.070 --> 01:11:15.290]
I'm not.

[01:11:15.410 --> 01:11:16.230]
You know what I just decided.

[01:11:16.370 --> 01:11:17.170]
I'm not giving those away.

[01:11:18.550 --> 01:11:19.570]
I'm going to wait till Monday.

[01:11:19.610 --> 01:11:22.990]
If the patriots are not in other words if the patriots lose.

[01:11:23.230 --> 01:11:23.930]
Forget about the dolphins,

[01:11:23.930 --> 01:11:26.550]
or while either one, I mean if the dolphins lose their,

[01:11:26.610 --> 01:11:27.890]
there won't be any game here anyway.

[01:11:28.230 --> 01:11:30.470]
Other than the Super Bowl and they sure won't be an ad.

[01:11:31.030 --> 01:11:31.990]
But that's the deal.

[01:11:32.090 --> 01:11:33.450]
I'm gonna wait till Monday and reassess,

[01:11:33.570 --> 01:11:35.130]
re-analyze my options here.

[01:11:35.130 --> 01:11:36.510]
And of course Monday we won't be here anyway.

[01:11:36.750 --> 01:11:39.750]
So till Tuesday, which really will keep them on a string.

[01:11:40.030 --> 01:11:41.210]
I got nothing for you guys.

[01:11:41.990 --> 01:11:42.310]
Nothing.

[01:11:42.790 --> 01:11:44.330]
If you wanna hang up, goodbye.

[01:11:45.330 --> 01:11:45.690]
Great.

[01:11:46.110 --> 01:11:46.810]
Have a great life.

[01:11:47.230 --> 01:11:47.890]
Jappy New Year.

[01:11:48.310 --> 01:11:48.850]
Good lost.

[01:11:49.950 --> 01:11:51.130]
I don't like these people.

[01:11:51.230 --> 01:11:51.510]
I really don't.

[01:11:51.590 --> 01:11:52.210]
I can't stand that.

[01:11:52.930 --> 01:11:53.650]
He starts out.

[01:11:53.690 --> 01:11:55.090]
He prefaces the call by saying,

[01:11:55.090 --> 01:11:56.710]
I'm not gonna want any tickets.

[01:11:56.730 --> 01:11:57.490]
Okay, fine.

[01:11:57.590 --> 01:11:58.610]
Then you got something to say.

[01:11:58.690 --> 01:11:59.550]
You called to speak to me.

[01:11:59.570 --> 01:12:00.490]
You're like a part of the show.

[01:12:00.690 --> 01:12:02.470]
But the championship game.

[01:12:02.570 --> 01:12:04.590]
I got your championship game right here.

[01:12:04.810 --> 01:12:10.050]
Plus face, pimple head, knuckle brain, needle nuts.

[01:12:10.990 --> 01:12:11.430]
God.

[01:12:13.590 --> 01:12:14.830]
But have a happy New Year.

[01:12:15.910 --> 01:12:17.070]
136 at WIOD.

[01:12:17.070 --> 01:12:18.330]
Let's press right on.

[01:12:18.430 --> 01:12:19.170]
Here's Palm Bay.

[01:12:19.290 --> 01:12:19.490]
Hello.

[01:12:19.810 --> 01:12:20.470]
Hey, Nell.

[01:12:20.630 --> 01:12:20.990]
How you doing?

[01:12:20.990 --> 01:12:21.410]
All right.

[01:12:21.490 --> 01:12:21.990]
You're the best.

[01:12:22.010 --> 01:12:23.690]
Hey, she's the best.

[01:12:23.690 --> 01:12:25.050]
Talk about the nerve of an elephant.

[01:12:25.310 --> 01:12:25.830]
Ha ha.

[01:12:25.990 --> 01:12:26.810]
What a bury that guy.

[01:12:26.970 --> 01:12:27.190]
Yeah.

[01:12:27.450 --> 01:12:29.190]
Hey, Nell, I wanna bring something up.

[01:12:29.550 --> 01:12:29.870]
I bet.

[01:12:30.490 --> 01:12:32.190]
Let's play some more Aaron Summers, okay?

[01:12:33.030 --> 01:12:34.630]
That way, not that much.

[01:12:34.850 --> 01:12:36.810]
My wife's been listening to her from Orlando.

[01:12:37.110 --> 01:12:39.690]
She comes home from work in the car.

[01:12:40.070 --> 01:12:41.730]
Sometimes she gets home, she's all worked up.

[01:12:41.890 --> 01:12:44.190]
Yeah, but she doesn't go and do a put on a strip show for you.

[01:12:44.270 --> 01:12:44.490]
Does she?

[01:12:44.790 --> 01:12:45.310]
No, no.

[01:12:45.570 --> 01:12:47.050]
And she doesn't like make a candle to dinner

[01:12:47.050 --> 01:12:48.910]
and call you on a phone 2,000 miles away

[01:12:48.910 --> 01:12:49.730]
and have phone sex.

[01:12:49.730 --> 01:12:50.970]
No, she knows how to do it.

[01:12:51.050 --> 01:12:51.610]
Yeah, there you go.

[01:12:51.610 --> 01:12:52.150]
That's the girl.

[01:12:52.430 --> 01:12:52.770]
You know something?

[01:12:52.950 --> 01:12:54.190]
I think most people know how to do it

[01:12:54.190 --> 01:12:55.050]
when you come right down to it.

[01:12:55.170 --> 01:12:55.310]
Yeah.

[01:12:55.690 --> 01:12:56.770]
So it's a natural thing.

[01:12:56.870 --> 01:12:58.090]
So it's got really nothing to do with, like,

[01:12:58.150 --> 01:13:00.350]
instruction or education as far as her show is concerned.

[01:13:00.450 --> 01:13:02.230]
It's just a titillation if I can say that again.

[01:13:02.370 --> 01:13:03.230]
Yeah, it gets you in the mood.

[01:13:03.470 --> 01:13:03.630]
Yeah.

[01:13:04.070 --> 01:13:05.350]
But anyway, what I wanna bring up was,

[01:13:05.430 --> 01:13:07.430]
remember when Rick Raleigh stole your briefcase?

[01:13:07.770 --> 01:13:09.210]
Yeah, that's why I just played that bit, like,

[01:13:09.590 --> 01:13:10.090]
20 minutes ago.

[01:13:10.150 --> 01:13:11.390]
Boy, that would have pissed me off.

[01:13:11.570 --> 01:13:11.690]
Yeah.

[01:13:11.970 --> 01:13:13.730]
You know, what if I came down there and,

[01:13:13.870 --> 01:13:14.130]
uh, just playing out here?

[01:13:14.130 --> 01:13:14.910]
Now, where is he feeding?

[01:13:14.910 --> 01:13:17.230]
This is not leading into Rick Raleigh's tickets,

[01:13:17.230 --> 01:13:17.910]
and you want him?

[01:13:18.070 --> 01:13:20.170]
If I was to clean out your desk or something.

[01:13:20.370 --> 01:13:23.750]
We have an open line on a green line, 1-800-944-9463.

[01:13:23.870 --> 01:13:23.990]
What?

[01:13:24.330 --> 01:13:24.830]
I told you.

[01:13:25.070 --> 01:13:25.730]
You told me what?

[01:13:26.030 --> 01:13:26.850]
Just say you don't have anything to do with you.

[01:13:26.850 --> 01:13:29.050]
So he's got to say in that I don't have it.

[01:13:29.210 --> 01:13:30.050]
I don't have him.

[01:13:30.370 --> 01:13:31.350]
I don't got him.

[01:13:31.810 --> 01:13:33.110]
But you are the Lord, Brian.

[01:13:40.090 --> 01:13:40.610]
I know.

[01:13:41.170 --> 01:13:44.210]
It is written that he who has the ticket will deny them.

[01:13:44.210 --> 01:13:45.110]
He has a wife, you know.

[01:13:46.690 --> 01:13:47.490]
It's 138.

[01:13:48.130 --> 01:13:51.830]
That's biggest dickest, by the way, for your mighty Python fans.

[01:13:52.210 --> 01:13:53.210]
Biggest, uh...

[01:13:54.050 --> 01:13:54.950]
Oh, you know who that was?

[01:13:54.990 --> 01:13:57.010]
That was Biggest Dickest Purton that called us from Detroit.

[01:13:57.250 --> 01:13:57.910]
That's who that was.

[01:13:58.210 --> 01:13:59.250]
I knew I was somebody familiar.

[01:13:59.770 --> 01:14:01.230]
Here's the curlsprings.

[01:14:01.230 --> 01:14:01.490]
Hello?

[01:14:01.890 --> 01:14:02.130]
Yeah.

[01:14:02.790 --> 01:14:03.450]
Hey, how you doing?

[01:14:03.630 --> 01:14:03.950]
Pretty good.

[01:14:04.190 --> 01:14:06.770]
How do you like these last two assholes on here, huh?

[01:14:07.030 --> 01:14:07.690]
Ah, cool.

[01:14:07.910 --> 01:14:08.430]
What a joke.

[01:14:08.790 --> 01:14:10.330]
Listen, I don't like the tosses.

[01:14:10.510 --> 01:14:11.610]
I don't want the tosses tickets.

[01:14:11.850 --> 01:14:12.010]
Good.

[01:14:12.010 --> 01:14:13.710]
As far as I know, the tosses can blow me.

[01:14:13.830 --> 01:14:14.810]
Scrum. There you go.

[01:14:14.990 --> 01:14:15.190]
All right.

[01:14:15.350 --> 01:14:15.870]
Don Shula.

[01:14:16.430 --> 01:14:18.630]
Take a little golf cart and just get lost.

[01:14:18.770 --> 01:14:18.970]
Right.

[01:14:19.490 --> 01:14:20.590]
Hopefully someone runs them over.

[01:14:20.690 --> 01:14:21.430]
Head out on the highway.

[01:14:21.650 --> 01:14:23.330]
Head out on the Palm Meadow would be a good place for her.

[01:14:23.390 --> 01:14:24.570]
Maybe on the Shula Expressway.

[01:14:24.810 --> 01:14:27.810]
Well, I don't know, but he probably drives that thing just like an old person.

[01:14:28.110 --> 01:14:28.650]
Uh-huh.

[01:14:29.110 --> 01:14:29.610]
Uh-huh.

[01:14:29.690 --> 01:14:30.010]
Neal.

[01:14:30.690 --> 01:14:31.390]
Hey, Neal.

[01:14:31.550 --> 01:14:31.730]
Yeah.

[01:14:31.970 --> 01:14:32.730]
You know that guy Greg?

[01:14:33.530 --> 01:14:33.750]
Yeah.

[01:14:33.930 --> 01:14:34.150]
All right.

[01:14:34.230 --> 01:14:35.270]
The guy that can't spell can't...

[01:14:35.270 --> 01:14:36.570]
The one with no life, yes.

[01:14:36.730 --> 01:14:37.130]
Yeah, all right.

[01:14:37.450 --> 01:14:38.390]
Well, I'm good friends with him.

[01:14:38.570 --> 01:14:38.770]
Yeah.

[01:14:38.770 --> 01:14:39.170]
All right.

[01:14:39.530 --> 01:14:42.570]
I think if you're giving anything away, I think you'll ever...

[01:14:42.570 --> 01:14:42.790]
Does he like try it?

[01:14:42.950 --> 01:14:43.070]
Huh?

[01:14:43.590 --> 01:14:43.930]
Go ahead.

[01:14:44.210 --> 01:14:45.670]
Does he like try to come on to your lot or what?

[01:14:45.730 --> 01:14:46.290]
No, no, no.

[01:14:46.450 --> 01:14:46.930]
I eat that white.

[01:14:47.050 --> 01:14:47.370]
Not yet.

[01:14:47.510 --> 01:14:47.710]
Okay.

[01:14:47.910 --> 01:14:48.690]
That's what you think.

[01:14:49.270 --> 01:14:51.030]
Maybe she'll give him hook on phonics.

[01:14:51.290 --> 01:14:51.430]
Yeah.

[01:14:52.190 --> 01:14:52.510]
Definitely.

[01:14:52.910 --> 01:14:53.150]
Okay.

[01:14:54.490 --> 01:14:56.670]
I just want to say I want to hear that OJ Simpson thing.

[01:14:56.910 --> 01:14:57.150]
Okay.

[01:14:57.490 --> 01:14:58.170]
Have a great weekend.

[01:14:58.290 --> 01:14:58.670]
Happy New Year.

[01:14:58.750 --> 01:14:59.790]
I said I wasn't going to play it today.

[01:15:00.390 --> 01:15:00.870]
Uh-uh.

[01:15:00.950 --> 01:15:01.590]
Where are we going next?

[01:15:02.190 --> 01:15:03.050]
They don't listen.

[01:15:03.290 --> 01:15:03.610]
You're right.

[01:15:03.710 --> 01:15:04.690]
They won't no matter what I say.

[01:15:04.770 --> 01:15:05.410]
They won't do the opposite.

[01:15:05.710 --> 01:15:06.910]
Let's play the bridge dander.

[01:15:06.910 --> 01:15:07.150]
Okay.

[01:15:07.290 --> 01:15:07.610]
Let's not.

[01:15:07.770 --> 01:15:09.410]
Let's play the I-95 asshole song.

[01:15:09.570 --> 01:15:10.770]
Let's do that OJ thing again.

[01:15:11.010 --> 01:15:12.370]
Let's hear a mandature sing.

[01:15:12.550 --> 01:15:13.310]
Let's, uh, yeah.

[01:15:14.530 --> 01:15:15.350]
That's what I say.

[01:15:15.750 --> 01:15:17.330]
Phil Henry coming in a little bit early today.

[01:15:17.550 --> 01:15:18.030]
He doesn't know it yet.

[01:15:18.130 --> 01:15:19.370]
Margaret will be on the first 20 minutes.

[01:15:20.730 --> 01:15:23.650]
And maybe Esther will come in for a few minutes too.

[01:15:25.370 --> 01:15:26.490]
Couldn't hurt at this point.

[01:15:26.570 --> 01:15:27.370]
Let's go to Davy.

[01:15:27.430 --> 01:15:27.670]
Hello.

[01:15:28.230 --> 01:15:28.590]
Yeah.

[01:15:28.670 --> 01:15:29.690]
I'll take the take a chneel.

[01:15:29.770 --> 01:15:29.990]
Yeah.

[01:15:30.050 --> 01:15:30.490]
Bet you will.

[01:15:30.610 --> 01:15:30.830]
Okay.

[01:15:30.910 --> 01:15:32.470]
Take this and stick away to Mondo's shine.

[01:15:32.470 --> 01:15:32.810]
Okay.

[01:15:32.810 --> 01:15:33.510]
Take it a life, Ken.

[01:15:33.970 --> 01:15:35.470]
Ken, how do we lope with Greg?

[01:15:35.470 --> 01:15:36.490]
Would be a real good match.

[01:15:36.490 --> 01:15:37.370]
I'll take that right now.

[01:15:38.830 --> 01:15:40.110]
Here's Miami on the purple line.

[01:15:40.190 --> 01:15:40.390]
Hello.

[01:15:40.730 --> 01:15:41.130]
Hey, Neil.

[01:15:41.190 --> 01:15:41.590]
How you doing?

[01:15:41.670 --> 01:15:41.950]
Okay.

[01:15:42.170 --> 01:15:43.270]
Hey, happy new year to you.

[01:15:43.330 --> 01:15:43.790]
Back to you.

[01:15:43.890 --> 01:15:45.010]
I feel sorry for you today.

[01:15:45.130 --> 01:15:45.990]
I know these guys are great.

[01:15:45.990 --> 01:15:46.490]
I know these guys are great.

[01:15:46.490 --> 01:15:47.690]
I think it's most amusing.

[01:15:47.870 --> 01:15:50.850]
It's a great education for the listeners out there.

[01:15:51.030 --> 01:15:51.230]
Yeah.

[01:15:51.350 --> 01:15:53.590]
What about your money grabbing, free loading, uh,

[01:15:53.730 --> 01:15:56.110]
slime balls we got in this town who give nothing and just take,

[01:15:56.210 --> 01:15:56.770]
take, take, take, take.

[01:15:56.770 --> 01:15:57.370]
That's all they do.

[01:15:57.530 --> 01:15:58.910]
That's all they know how to do is take it.

[01:15:59.150 --> 01:16:01.730]
Me and my friend Brian were working today and we're talking

[01:16:01.730 --> 01:16:03.030]
about the same exact thing.

[01:16:03.610 --> 01:16:05.990]
Uh, the only thing is, you know, we were talking and we were wondering,

[01:16:05.990 --> 01:16:09.730]
we got a couple of tickets to the Miami Hurricanes basketball games tomorrow.

[01:16:09.830 --> 01:16:12.290]
Oh, that, now you're talking heavy duty.

[01:16:12.410 --> 01:16:13.910]
Now we know something that everybody wants.

[01:16:13.990 --> 01:16:16.170]
Yeah, I know it's not much because I was wondering if you, uh,

[01:16:16.250 --> 01:16:17.470]
you might want a couple of tickets.

[01:16:17.470 --> 01:16:19.050]
We got a couple extra if you want.

[01:16:20.170 --> 01:16:21.690]
I mean, you know, yeah.

[01:16:22.870 --> 01:16:24.650]
I know it's not the hottest ticket in town.

[01:16:24.750 --> 01:16:26.230]
No, I know where they were.

[01:16:26.250 --> 01:16:26.490]
Where they were.

[01:16:26.490 --> 01:16:26.750]
Where they were.

[01:16:26.790 --> 01:16:28.730]
Who are they playing?

[01:16:28.790 --> 01:16:29.350]
Is Shiva you?

[01:16:29.430 --> 01:16:30.110]
Is that who they're playing?

[01:16:31.210 --> 01:16:32.410]
Nobody knows, nobody cares.

[01:16:32.530 --> 01:16:35.850]
Uh, yeah, but, you know, we were wondering if you like to come down and watch it with us.

[01:16:35.930 --> 01:16:36.350]
We love that.

[01:16:36.350 --> 01:16:37.390]
Okay, guys, thanks anyway.

[01:16:37.390 --> 01:16:38.210]
See I get out of here.

[01:16:38.250 --> 01:16:40.110]
We have an open line on the purple line, pound IOD.

[01:16:40.850 --> 01:16:42.710]
Here's the mobile, a water nail.

[01:16:42.770 --> 01:16:43.070]
Hello.

[01:16:43.310 --> 01:16:44.330]
Hey, Neil, how you doing?

[01:16:44.410 --> 01:16:44.610]
Good.

[01:16:45.270 --> 01:16:46.350]
Happy, happy New Year.

[01:16:46.830 --> 01:16:47.010]
Happy New Year.

[01:16:47.030 --> 01:16:47.990]
What can we give you, sir?

[01:16:48.070 --> 01:16:50.270]
What can we wrap up in with a big bow on it and send to you?

[01:16:50.470 --> 01:16:50.690]
Nothing.

[01:16:50.850 --> 01:16:51.590]
I want to have a question.

[01:16:51.630 --> 01:16:52.690]
I want a big jar of honey.

[01:16:52.930 --> 01:16:53.230]
Yeah.

[01:16:53.370 --> 01:16:53.850]
All right, honey.

[01:16:54.070 --> 01:16:54.610]
No bags.

[01:16:55.010 --> 01:16:58.010]
Hey, listen, whatever happened to the Dean, uh, you, W.

[01:16:58.330 --> 01:16:59.350]
Whatever happened to him.

[01:16:59.350 --> 01:17:01.730]
He's pushing up a tune, he's been dead for years now, man.

[01:17:01.850 --> 01:17:03.070]
That's about three years ago.

[01:17:03.090 --> 01:17:04.290]
Do I remember you used to get a lot of mileage?

[01:17:04.410 --> 01:17:04.970]
I am.

[01:17:05.070 --> 01:17:05.530]
You dummy.

[01:17:05.650 --> 01:17:06.370]
You know, that stuff.

[01:17:06.430 --> 01:17:07.030]
He be dead.

[01:17:07.210 --> 01:17:07.730]
He be dead.

[01:17:07.810 --> 01:17:09.350]
He be real dead, the Dean.

[01:17:09.450 --> 01:17:11.810]
He's the blue hair over America tour.

[01:17:12.170 --> 01:17:13.930]
The blue hair over America tour.

[01:17:14.050 --> 01:17:14.710]
Yeah, we got that.

[01:17:14.830 --> 01:17:17.750]
Is that what is his daughter or his wife or who was that?

[01:17:17.990 --> 01:17:18.530]
Who was that?

[01:17:18.530 --> 01:17:18.570]
Who was what?

[01:17:19.050 --> 01:17:20.610]
That had nothing to do with him.

[01:17:21.050 --> 01:17:21.890]
I thought it was a wreck.

[01:17:22.190 --> 01:17:23.790]
I messed up buck to you, dummy.

[01:17:24.250 --> 01:17:26.190]
Oh, I have a great life, Pellie.

[01:17:26.830 --> 01:17:27.690]
Where are we going next?

[01:17:27.850 --> 01:17:28.890]
We're going to Miami on the Star Line.

[01:17:28.890 --> 01:17:29.190]
Hello.

[01:17:29.370 --> 01:17:30.590]
Hey, Neil, how are you?

[01:17:30.650 --> 01:17:30.850]
Good.

[01:17:31.050 --> 01:17:33.330]
So glad I just switched over to Bell South.

[01:17:33.670 --> 01:17:34.490]
Yeah, nice move.

[01:17:34.730 --> 01:17:37.150]
And you're probably the one that put us over the under the edge.

[01:17:37.190 --> 01:17:38.070]
Thanks a lot.

[01:17:38.470 --> 01:17:43.510]
Hey, I just want to let people know that old James is sitting in his car because it'd be raining down there.

[01:17:43.830 --> 01:17:44.950]
Oh, that'd be bad.

[01:17:45.150 --> 01:17:45.450]
Yes.

[01:17:45.630 --> 01:17:46.290]
Is he doing it?

[01:17:46.390 --> 01:17:47.510]
Is he doing any business down there?

[01:17:47.790 --> 01:17:51.310]
Not bad if he can get through ActBard inside the service station.

[01:17:51.510 --> 01:17:51.650]
Yeah.

[01:17:51.770 --> 01:17:53.350]
And ask him where he's at.

[01:17:53.550 --> 01:17:55.290]
You mean, Ossamade has given directions down there?

[01:17:55.370 --> 01:17:56.250]
He kind of saw it up.

[01:17:56.370 --> 01:17:56.630]
Great.

[01:17:56.630 --> 01:17:58.270]
And then you can get him.

[01:17:58.290 --> 01:18:00.050]
Yeah, there are a couple of people there when I was there.

[01:18:00.210 --> 01:18:00.990]
He's doing it.

[01:18:00.990 --> 01:18:07.650]
Anyway, I want to let you know that one of my former students is up there at MSU Park Renardi.

[01:18:07.830 --> 01:18:08.430]
He's running back.

[01:18:08.550 --> 01:18:09.350]
Red shirt freshman.

[01:18:09.510 --> 01:18:09.930]
All right.

[01:18:10.210 --> 01:18:11.310]
Yeah, and he's doing real well.

[01:18:11.470 --> 01:18:12.110]
It's just very well.

[01:18:12.250 --> 01:18:13.170]
Red shirt freshman.

[01:18:13.210 --> 01:18:14.770]
That means he'll be there like what, eight, nine years?

[01:18:14.950 --> 01:18:16.390]
Ah, that's good.

[01:18:16.590 --> 01:18:16.590]

[01:18:16.890 --> 01:18:17.810]
Like the way we do it up there.

[01:18:17.830 --> 01:18:18.610]
Yeah, he doesn't get his act together.

[01:18:18.610 --> 01:18:20.450]
Red shirt, green shirt, purple shirt, no shirt.

[01:18:20.750 --> 01:18:21.770]
He doesn't get his act together.

[01:18:21.770 --> 01:18:22.470]
He's just great.

[01:18:22.630 --> 01:18:22.750]
He's up.

[01:18:22.770 --> 01:18:24.150]
He may be out of there in his spring.

[01:18:24.390 --> 01:18:25.210]
I don't worry about that.

[01:18:25.210 --> 01:18:27.290]
We don't worry about things like grades at MSU.

[01:18:27.290 --> 01:18:27.670]
I don't know.

[01:18:27.790 --> 01:18:29.450]
With a new coach though, they may...

[01:18:29.450 --> 01:18:30.130]
Who is the new coach?

[01:18:30.270 --> 01:18:30.570]
I don't know.

[01:18:30.870 --> 01:18:31.250]
We don't know.

[01:18:31.250 --> 01:18:32.210]
They haven't named one yet, huh?

[01:18:32.270 --> 01:18:37.670]
Now, in fact, one of our assistant athletic director from the high school, she went up there,

[01:18:37.830 --> 01:18:43.910]
and now she works with all the football players as far as keeping their grades off and getting them to class.

[01:18:44.170 --> 01:18:45.210]
No, I'm...

[01:18:45.870 --> 01:18:47.490]
Well, I'm sure they're all standing in Weshaw Hall.

[01:18:47.570 --> 01:18:48.790]
That's where all the stupid jocks stand.

[01:18:49.150 --> 01:18:49.490]
I don't know.

[01:18:49.610 --> 01:18:50.370]
He should be home.

[01:18:50.530 --> 01:18:53.130]
I'm surprised you don't listen, because I know all the kids are schooled.

[01:18:53.130 --> 01:18:54.370]
Yeah, likely still.

[01:18:54.430 --> 01:18:56.190]
Well, yeah, but nobody taught him how to dial a phone yet.

[01:18:56.270 --> 01:18:57.610]
You know MSU, we're a little slow.

[01:18:57.610 --> 01:18:58.050]
That's right.

[01:18:58.050 --> 01:18:59.030]
You have a great new year, pal.

[01:18:59.130 --> 01:18:59.950]
Hey, you two, Neil.

[01:18:59.970 --> 01:19:00.250]
Okay.

[01:19:00.770 --> 01:19:01.750]
See it, the...

[01:19:01.750 --> 01:19:02.270]
Coral Gables.

[01:19:02.650 --> 01:19:06.810]
Now, I'm confused though, because that restaurant up there, I've had people call me over the years say it's closed.

[01:19:06.930 --> 01:19:09.090]
It's not there anymore, and then people call it say that it's open.

[01:19:09.410 --> 01:19:10.610]
It's on Grand River Ravanoo.

[01:19:10.970 --> 01:19:12.570]
It was a very, very famous like a...

[01:19:12.570 --> 01:19:13.190]
Like a...

[01:19:13.190 --> 01:19:14.870]
Kind of like a pizza loft with a lot of beer.

[01:19:15.850 --> 01:19:20.170]
I mean, it had pizza and spaghetti, and just they used to some more bottled beer in the Gables

[01:19:20.170 --> 01:19:23.110]
than any other establishment, any other bar, anywhere else.

[01:19:23.110 --> 01:19:23.930]
Anywhere in America.

[01:19:24.110 --> 01:19:24.930]
For years, it was like that.

[01:19:25.190 --> 01:19:28.410]
And then I remember getting calls, oh, it's not there anymore, and I found that very hard to believe.

[01:19:28.470 --> 01:19:31.550]
That would be like saying that cutting ham drugs on Grand River is not there.

[01:19:31.590 --> 01:19:32.290]
I don't believe that either.

[01:19:33.410 --> 01:19:35.410]
And then we'd have calls say, oh, they're full of crap.

[01:19:35.550 --> 01:19:35.930]
It is there.

[01:19:35.990 --> 01:19:39.550]
We just got through drinking 85-12 packs, and I don't know what the answer is.

[01:19:39.590 --> 01:19:41.530]
But since we don't have anybody from East Lansing or Michigan,

[01:19:41.750 --> 01:19:41.970]
stay there.

[01:19:42.050 --> 01:19:42.990]
Can't tell me the answer anyway.

[01:19:43.090 --> 01:19:43.530]
Do you, Spaks?

[01:19:44.150 --> 01:19:44.610]
Go Michigan!

[01:19:45.130 --> 01:19:45.450]
Oh, sorry.

[01:19:46.430 --> 01:19:47.910]
144, W-I-O-D.

[01:19:48.090 --> 01:19:51.210]
And speaking of a Go-Man Go, we got Ladies Night at Pompedo Park tonight.

[01:19:51.210 --> 01:19:52.970]
Every Thursday night is Ladies Night.

[01:19:53.110 --> 01:19:54.130]
Ladies admission is free.

[01:19:54.290 --> 01:19:56.650]
You get two for one drink coupons, even a free betting voucher.

[01:19:56.730 --> 01:20:00.110]
We got SimalCast 3 races every night from the metal lands in New Jersey

[01:20:00.570 --> 01:20:02.990]
and a live on track racing as well, of course.

[01:20:03.190 --> 01:20:06.510]
And we also have Pick 7 poolway drink with the metal lands where you can really win a bundle.

[01:20:06.810 --> 01:20:07.430]
Tomorrow it's Friday.

[01:20:07.430 --> 01:20:08.770]
That means I'll be doing a handy camping.

[01:20:08.830 --> 01:20:11.310]
It also means you can enjoy 50-cent beer hot dogs and sodas.

[01:20:11.710 --> 01:20:13.610]
Saturday it's the weekly $1,000 cash giveaway.

[01:20:13.910 --> 01:20:16.130]
In fact, a lot of you punks that are down here for the holidays now.

[01:20:16.550 --> 01:20:17.550]
Come on out to Pompedo Park.

[01:20:17.670 --> 01:20:19.610]
Watch how Sean bets, and then bet just the opposite.

[01:20:19.610 --> 01:20:22.390]
Follow Fat Rich to the window and plunge your lungs out.

[01:20:22.390 --> 01:20:24.010]
You'll be going home with Bushel barrels of money.

[01:20:24.350 --> 01:20:25.690]
And don't forget New Year's Eve.

[01:20:25.690 --> 01:20:27.570]
It's another big thing we got at Pompedo this year.

[01:20:27.910 --> 01:20:29.790]
The annual New Year's Eve party Saturday night.

[01:20:29.790 --> 01:20:31.050]
You'll enjoy a night of great racing.

[01:20:31.170 --> 01:20:33.090]
Find dining in the top of the park, La Baza, dining room,

[01:20:33.210 --> 01:20:35.430]
and music and dancing in the founders room.

[01:20:35.730 --> 01:20:39.670]
Come watch, wage your plunge, and win your way into the New Year at Pompedo Park Saturday night.

[01:20:40.110 --> 01:20:42.910]
Don't forget the new schedule now racing every night except Tuesday and Sunday.

[01:20:43.050 --> 01:20:43.970]
Post time 730.

[01:20:44.210 --> 01:20:46.790]
See you tonight for Ladies Night at Pompedo Park.

[01:20:47.710 --> 01:20:50.410]
The 95 Orange Bowl is almost here.

[01:20:50.770 --> 01:20:52.370]
Got your choke chains ready?

[01:20:53.150 --> 01:20:54.730]
The chains and corn huskers.

[01:20:55.470 --> 01:20:58.090]
Hurricanes are big, fast, noisy, and scary.

[01:20:58.750 --> 01:21:02.610]
Corn huskers are guys who shut corn and choke at big game time.

[01:21:03.290 --> 01:21:04.630]
Chains and corn huskers.

[01:21:04.950 --> 01:21:08.790]
Pre-game starts at 5 p.m. Sunday on the voice of the chains.

[01:21:09.330 --> 01:21:10.790]
610 WIOD.

[01:21:14.270 --> 01:21:15.550]
610 WIOD.

[01:21:15.550 --> 01:21:19.230]
No one can lick us, but it feels good when they try.

[01:21:19.450 --> 01:21:22.990]
And he puts his thumb where they're supposed to be on peanut.

[01:21:45.550 --> 01:21:52.450]
It gets kisses from girls, they stroke his balls, never touch her behind.

[01:21:53.450 --> 01:21:54.190]
It's 16.

[01:21:54.970 --> 01:21:59.450]
It's beautiful and it's fine on my life.

[01:22:01.190 --> 01:22:08.590]
It goes crazy when it's bad, when it's bigger, it's better, yeah.

[01:22:09.030 --> 01:22:14.550]
It's filled my hand, it touched my chest, ooh when it blew.

[01:22:15.170 --> 01:22:20.430]
It ruined my best and came out of my jeans and into my life.

[01:22:20.430 --> 01:22:23.350]
Oh, how it makes me feel fine.

[01:22:23.770 --> 01:22:24.950]
It's 16.

[01:22:25.630 --> 01:22:29.650]
It's so beautiful and it's mine.

[01:22:34.510 --> 01:22:35.550]
148 WIOD.

[01:22:35.690 --> 01:22:36.990]
Don't forget phone sex for there in summers.

[01:22:37.250 --> 01:22:41.550]
I mean, passion phones for there in summers, week from Monday, January 9th.

[01:22:41.550 --> 01:22:43.470]
It's going to be just, I don't know.

[01:22:44.010 --> 01:22:45.030]
Let's go to plantation.

[01:22:45.370 --> 01:22:45.570]
Hello.

[01:22:46.310 --> 01:22:46.830]
Neil.

[01:22:47.110 --> 01:22:47.390]
Yes, sir.

[01:22:47.650 --> 01:22:48.010]
Thank you.

[01:22:48.010 --> 01:22:48.890]
You got me a job.

[01:22:49.390 --> 01:22:49.930]
Doing what?

[01:22:50.710 --> 01:22:54.090]
I'm working for Double Play Deep Down Service out there in Boka.

[01:22:54.670 --> 01:22:54.830]
Yeah?

[01:22:55.190 --> 01:22:58.890]
I was on a job and a guy is talking to me and somehow your name came up.

[01:22:59.010 --> 01:23:00.130]
Next thing I know, I got the job.

[01:23:00.450 --> 01:23:00.830]
Come on.

[01:23:01.010 --> 01:23:02.170]
Yeah, we were talking about town.

[01:23:02.450 --> 01:23:03.570]
Yeah, I can get out of town.

[01:23:03.810 --> 01:23:04.110]
All right.

[01:23:04.390 --> 01:23:05.950]
We were talking for about 20 minutes about your show.

[01:23:06.270 --> 01:23:06.810]
Isn't that great?

[01:23:07.490 --> 01:23:08.850]
It usually works the other way.

[01:23:08.970 --> 01:23:12.450]
You mentioned my, in fact, if you already got a job and you mentioned my name, you don't have one anymore.

[01:23:12.670 --> 01:23:14.510]
Yeah, well, it's funny you said that.

[01:23:14.630 --> 01:23:16.490]
I used to work for Bell South Mobility.

[01:23:16.490 --> 01:23:17.290]
There you go.

[01:23:17.450 --> 01:23:18.490]
It's a good thing it's used is.

[01:23:19.110 --> 01:23:22.170]
Hey, my old job a couple of years ago, I used to sell pornographic tapes.

[01:23:22.310 --> 01:23:22.450]
Yeah.

[01:23:22.630 --> 01:23:24.270]
And maybe for this Christmas, I can send you a few.

[01:23:24.570 --> 01:23:25.170]
There you go.

[01:23:25.350 --> 01:23:26.030]
Would you like a cup of coffee?

[01:23:26.030 --> 01:23:27.130]
No, send him to a halloween killer.

[01:23:27.250 --> 01:23:27.810]
She'll enjoy him.

[01:23:28.090 --> 01:23:28.690]
She'll enjoy him.

[01:23:28.770 --> 01:23:30.790]
Sure she will, but I think you might enjoy him better.

[01:23:31.010 --> 01:23:31.490]
Send him to Aaron.

[01:23:32.010 --> 01:23:32.310]
Hey, Neil.

[01:23:32.570 --> 01:23:32.710]
Yeah.

[01:23:33.050 --> 01:23:35.290]
What are the odds of going to the orange bone getting scalp tickets?

[01:23:36.130 --> 01:23:36.870]
What are the odds?

[01:23:37.050 --> 01:23:37.930]
Pretty good down there in Miami.

[01:23:38.070 --> 01:23:38.610]
No problem.

[01:23:38.710 --> 01:23:39.250]
No sweat ski.

[01:23:39.490 --> 01:23:40.210]
No, no seriousness.

[01:23:40.830 --> 01:23:42.370]
I'm telling you, there'll be all over the place.

[01:23:42.590 --> 01:23:45.230]
Yeah, but I'm sure if you had an extra couple tickets, you'd be sending them my way.

[01:23:46.490 --> 01:23:47.890]
Let's go to Miami.

[01:23:48.050 --> 01:23:48.250]
Hello.

[01:23:49.370 --> 01:23:49.910]
Hello, Neil.

[01:23:50.310 --> 01:23:51.830]
I want to find out where that guy's working right now.

[01:23:51.830 --> 01:23:52.610]
We can take care of that.

[01:23:52.670 --> 01:23:52.870]
Yes.

[01:23:53.090 --> 01:23:53.470]
Hello, Neil.

[01:23:53.630 --> 01:23:54.270]
Happy New Year.

[01:23:54.370 --> 01:23:54.830]
Back to you.

[01:23:54.930 --> 01:23:56.830]
You and all your listeners, eight miles.

[01:23:57.110 --> 01:23:57.110]

[01:23:57.110 --> 01:23:58.170]
My whole year worthwhile.

[01:23:58.590 --> 01:23:59.390]
Well, isn't that something?

[01:23:59.410 --> 01:24:00.510]
It's good to take care of your work.

[01:24:01.450 --> 01:24:03.110]
And take care and I wish you the best.

[01:24:03.330 --> 01:24:03.710]
Thank you.

[01:24:03.790 --> 01:24:04.030]
Bye-bye.

[01:24:04.130 --> 01:24:05.410]
Okay, that was very nice.

[01:24:05.930 --> 01:24:06.990]
Oh, and look who we have here.

[01:24:07.070 --> 01:24:08.290]
It's the old cockamoon lady.

[01:24:08.790 --> 01:24:09.290]
That's it.

[01:24:09.450 --> 01:24:11.990]
I call to wish you a very healthy.

[01:24:12.130 --> 01:24:12.450]
Cockamoon.

[01:24:13.210 --> 01:24:13.530]
Cockamoon.

[01:24:13.730 --> 01:24:13.910]
Yeah.

[01:24:13.910 --> 01:24:16.530]
I'm very healthy and I have been no year.

[01:24:16.670 --> 01:24:17.750]
And likewise to you.

[01:24:17.750 --> 01:24:18.410]
I have life, right?

[01:24:18.430 --> 01:24:18.650]
Yeah.

[01:24:18.930 --> 01:24:19.130]
Okay.

[01:24:19.370 --> 01:24:19.950]
Bye-bye.

[01:24:20.070 --> 01:24:20.410]
Bye-bye.

[01:24:21.010 --> 01:24:22.230]
Okay, a lot of short ones here.

[01:24:22.310 --> 01:24:24.650]
Let's get a few short ones in before the end of we'll get Aaron on again.

[01:24:24.770 --> 01:24:25.810]
She knows a lot about short ones.

[01:24:26.230 --> 01:24:26.750]
Here's Miami.

[01:24:26.970 --> 01:24:27.170]
Hello.

[01:24:29.190 --> 01:24:30.650]
Let's go to Opalaka.

[01:24:30.970 --> 01:24:31.170]
Hello.

[01:24:31.630 --> 01:24:32.230]
Neil, how are you?

[01:24:32.470 --> 01:24:32.590]
Good.

[01:24:33.410 --> 01:24:37.990]
You were saying that if the Wingo loses on Sunday, that they're the only team that Miami could play at home?

[01:24:38.630 --> 01:24:39.630]
I did not say that at all.

[01:24:39.730 --> 01:24:40.750]
I said if New England loses it.

[01:24:40.770 --> 01:24:41.490]
But it didn't mean by that.

[01:24:41.510 --> 01:24:42.390]
If they lose their route.

[01:24:42.390 --> 01:24:45.930]
I understand that, but there's another team of Miami could host the ASEJ.

[01:24:46.010 --> 01:24:46.770]
The Browns, that's right.

[01:24:46.870 --> 01:24:47.050]
Okay.

[01:24:47.250 --> 01:24:49.010]
I already went through that whole thing before.

[01:24:49.250 --> 01:24:50.070]
Get out of here already.

[01:24:50.330 --> 01:24:51.610]
This guy's going to give me an education.

[01:24:51.830 --> 01:24:56.570]
He's probably also the guy that called D.Fo this morning telling that the Miami and San Diego are going to play for the

[01:24:56.570 --> 01:24:57.610]
Divisional Championship.

[01:24:58.250 --> 01:25:01.530]
I don't need no instructions on who's playing with whom, okay, Pally?

[01:25:02.370 --> 01:25:02.590]
God.

[01:25:03.870 --> 01:25:08.610]
These people, like I said, they wouldn't know Brian Sip from Brian from Dave Copay.

[01:25:09.750 --> 01:25:11.830]
There wouldn't be Bernie Kossar from J. Heiler.

[01:25:13.470 --> 01:25:14.670]
Here's the Port Saint Loosely.

[01:25:14.850 --> 01:25:15.010]
Hello.

[01:25:15.170 --> 01:25:16.250]
How you doing?

[01:25:16.530 --> 01:25:16.870]
Okay.

[01:25:17.090 --> 01:25:22.650]
Listen, I want to tell you that I watch you in Gary Sip Bell on that ITW thing and you guys are right.

[01:25:22.910 --> 01:25:23.310]
We are.

[01:25:23.490 --> 01:25:23.690]
Yeah.

[01:25:23.930 --> 01:25:24.850]
We have a great time doing that.

[01:25:24.910 --> 01:25:27.910]
By the way, did you watch last Friday when I picked 10 winners and 13 races?

[01:25:28.210 --> 01:25:28.210]

[01:25:28.570 --> 01:25:28.850]
Yes.

[01:25:29.030 --> 01:25:29.550]
Well, I want to tell you.

[01:25:29.550 --> 01:25:30.590]
You hope the check is in the mail.

[01:25:30.930 --> 01:25:36.790]
I haven't had one person called yet who said thank you so much Neil for a brilliant job of handicapping.

[01:25:36.790 --> 01:25:40.970]
You picked 10 winners on top, including Gypsy, Shiver with Markov and it paid almost $18.

[01:25:41.650 --> 01:25:44.210]
There's not one, the show you the kind of time it is they take.

[01:25:44.490 --> 01:25:48.050]
But boy, if you pick a couple of horses that think they join out, you sure hear about that real quick.

[01:25:48.110 --> 01:25:50.130]
How come Fat Rich doesn't pick anyone when he's on it?

[01:25:50.370 --> 01:25:52.010]
Because he keeps them all from self-right away.

[01:25:52.010 --> 01:25:53.970]
I think he cashes all the big tickets from that one.

[01:25:54.050 --> 01:25:55.710]
He's got little game plan he's following there.

[01:25:55.930 --> 01:25:59.990]
Listen, you got one big advantage over Gary Sip Bell and that you tell like it is what the drive is.

[01:26:00.070 --> 01:26:01.650]
I think he's afraid of offending them or something.

[01:26:01.710 --> 01:26:04.630]
Well, no, but none of the handicappers, because they expect me to do that.

[01:26:04.630 --> 01:26:06.190]
See, if it comes from them, then they get upset.

[01:26:06.490 --> 01:26:08.210]
But for me, they expect me to be obnoxious.

[01:26:08.290 --> 01:26:13.630]
But it's true when you go to the track, man, people let bet on these guys like Gary McQuade and Donald Brainer and these other...

[01:26:13.630 --> 01:26:15.410]
Forget about them, man. Just cross them out.

[01:26:15.590 --> 01:26:16.670]
Just went and down cross the line.

[01:26:16.970 --> 01:26:21.090]
Let them win their two or three races and you're the other 99% of the time you have your money in your pocket.

[01:26:21.250 --> 01:26:23.390]
We know that W and Drew Campbell stands for the worst.

[01:26:23.830 --> 01:26:26.150]
Oh, he is brutal. He is unbelievable.

[01:26:26.310 --> 01:26:27.870]
You got John Campbell's brother, I don't think so.

[01:26:28.370 --> 01:26:33.290]
And by the way, you noticed the last week or so, Kevin Wallace hopped on a couple of horses for the first time,

[01:26:33.290 --> 01:26:35.150]
like that water reputation, time the...

[01:26:35.150 --> 01:26:38.930]
Eat time the kites, away 600 pounds, Kevin drives doors for the first time.

[01:26:39.190 --> 01:26:42.250]
They're trying to let Providence win his memorial race, the last race of his career,

[01:26:42.370 --> 01:26:43.570]
because he got retired Wednesday.

[01:26:44.050 --> 01:26:47.990]
And here comes Kevin flying down the inside and wins going away by open lengths.

[01:26:48.230 --> 01:26:50.170]
Kevin can show him all his rear end.

[01:26:50.330 --> 01:26:51.130]
And what's with Peter Renzi?

[01:26:51.330 --> 01:26:51.770]
He's a good wrestler.

[01:26:52.870 --> 01:26:54.690]
He's doing okay. He's up there at the metal line.

[01:26:54.690 --> 01:26:55.630]
You're not going to come down here full time?

[01:26:55.790 --> 01:26:57.890]
No, he's not going to be here. What do we need him here for?

[01:26:57.990 --> 01:27:00.190]
He's a good guy, but let him stay up there and make some bucks.

[01:27:00.490 --> 01:27:01.930]
Okay, and you'll keep telling him the like it is.

[01:27:01.930 --> 01:27:02.770]
Okay, bye-bye.

[01:27:02.870 --> 01:27:03.650]
See ya, and you're welcome.

[01:27:05.450 --> 01:27:06.170]
Ah, boy.

[01:27:06.850 --> 01:27:08.490]
So what's the deal? We're getting tomorrow off, too.

[01:27:08.890 --> 01:27:11.070]
Everybody just left. Bob Green left. George left.

[01:27:11.210 --> 01:27:12.090]
Or everybody walked out.

[01:27:12.910 --> 01:27:16.550]
So now is the deal. Now it's my radio station for the next seven minutes.

[01:27:17.110 --> 01:27:19.170]
Canceled due to lack of interest. That's what the audience said.

[01:27:19.510 --> 01:27:21.530]
Now, what are you bringing me this for? I don't want the entries.

[01:27:21.530 --> 01:27:23.370]
What day is this for? Or the entries for Monday?

[01:27:24.430 --> 01:27:26.010]
Well, there's that coming around with Tim Mayery.

[01:27:26.130 --> 01:27:28.190]
Just one last night is coming right back on Monday.

[01:27:28.250 --> 01:27:29.810]
That's always a good thing to keep your eye on.

[01:27:29.810 --> 01:27:33.830]
Tim Mayery. Dangerous. Dangerous, but don't expect to cash on him ever.

[01:27:34.590 --> 01:27:37.490]
There's Kerry Carcos and at Johnny's goal on the rail, Richie.

[01:27:37.610 --> 01:27:40.530]
I got all these entries for Monday. Well, the night should be a real big night at Pompa.

[01:27:40.530 --> 01:27:42.190]
I'm going to be there with millions of dollars.

[01:27:42.430 --> 01:27:44.830]
And what are we going to do about these Rick Riley tickets, by the way?

[01:27:45.570 --> 01:27:46.230]
Tomorrow's D-Day.

[01:27:47.350 --> 01:27:49.450]
I'm serious. If I, now I'm not making this up.

[01:27:49.710 --> 01:27:52.310]
I don't want to play with anybody's emotions, but I have no other choice.

[01:27:52.630 --> 01:27:56.950]
If I don't have an answer from him by 11 o'clock tomorrow morning on the air or off the year.

[01:27:56.950 --> 01:27:59.030]
I'm going to give him a message from him. I'm giving his tickets away.

[01:28:01.430 --> 01:28:02.790]
And I don't care if he...

[01:28:02.790 --> 01:28:02.990]
And I don't care if he...

[01:28:02.990 --> 01:28:03.450]
And I what my pay?

[01:28:03.550 --> 01:28:04.070]
I don't care.

[01:28:05.970 --> 01:28:07.130]
Here's Oakland Park. Hello.

[01:28:07.930 --> 01:28:08.130]
Hello.

[01:28:08.590 --> 01:28:08.690]
Yeah.

[01:28:09.430 --> 01:28:10.130]
Hey. Yeah.

[01:28:10.130 --> 01:28:11.370]
You just call you from Martin, Michigan.

[01:28:12.190 --> 01:28:13.190]
Well, nobody's perfect.

[01:28:13.250 --> 01:28:13.510]
I know.

[01:28:13.810 --> 01:28:16.230]
I was the first one I told you about deck talking about you.

[01:28:16.390 --> 01:28:16.570]
Yeah.

[01:28:16.690 --> 01:28:17.330]
The air. Yeah.

[01:28:17.670 --> 01:28:19.710]
And that's great that he's down here now with the daughters and everything.

[01:28:19.870 --> 01:28:20.330]
That's super.

[01:28:20.570 --> 01:28:21.310]
I met one of his daughters.

[01:28:21.310 --> 01:28:22.550]
He's all 45 of his daughters.

[01:28:22.850 --> 01:28:24.730]
I met one on that Tobal Hall one night.

[01:28:24.930 --> 01:28:25.210]
And?

[01:28:25.770 --> 01:28:26.130]
Nice.

[01:28:26.130 --> 01:28:27.070]
They are nice.

[01:28:27.430 --> 01:28:29.050]
Anyway, Paul's that story.

[01:28:29.170 --> 01:28:30.650]
Gotta say that they're listening. What is it?

[01:28:30.790 --> 01:28:31.570]
Paul's that story.

[01:28:31.750 --> 01:28:31.990]
Yeah.

[01:28:32.390 --> 01:28:33.990]
My ex girlfriend used to do that.

[01:28:34.430 --> 01:28:37.870]
And they would call her house and then she would get their number and then call them back.

[01:28:38.150 --> 01:28:38.310]
Yeah.

[01:28:38.570 --> 01:28:41.350]
And she'd be like full of laundry and...

[01:28:41.350 --> 01:28:43.590]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

[01:28:44.090 --> 01:28:50.490]
Doing something really erotic, folding laundry or making Swiss cheese in a cheese machine or doing something.

[01:28:50.770 --> 01:28:50.770]

[01:28:50.950 --> 01:28:51.990]
It was a hilarious feeling.

[01:28:52.090 --> 01:28:52.230]
Great.

[01:28:52.990 --> 01:28:53.370]
Beauty.

[01:28:53.370 --> 01:28:54.750]
Cleaning out the refrigerator?

[01:28:55.110 --> 01:28:55.470]
Yeah.

[01:28:55.550 --> 01:28:56.670]
It was all man.

[01:28:56.930 --> 01:28:59.390]
They hear a breathing heavy and she be like vacuuming in the back.

[01:28:59.530 --> 01:29:01.590]
They think that they she had one of those acu jacks going.

[01:29:01.730 --> 01:29:03.170]
These people haven't got a clue man.

[01:29:03.250 --> 01:29:05.430]
These people with those phone sex line talk about no life.

[01:29:05.450 --> 01:29:06.050]
They think it was funny.

[01:29:06.230 --> 01:29:06.490]
Okay.

[01:29:06.630 --> 01:29:07.330]
Have a happy.

[01:29:07.410 --> 01:29:07.690]
Bye.

[01:29:07.850 --> 01:29:08.210]
See ya.

[01:29:09.250 --> 01:29:13.090]
But hey, to reach its own and there are people making a genius at dollars doing that.

[01:29:13.130 --> 01:29:16.370]
So it goes to show you how we press the people in this country are really sad.

[01:29:16.710 --> 01:29:20.530]
Really sad when people have to be yanking and talking to some pathetic voice on the other.

[01:29:20.670 --> 01:29:22.870]
Or even great voice attached to a disgusting body.

[01:29:23.170 --> 01:29:25.130]
Like that one, we're gonna turn her loose for a second.

[01:29:25.230 --> 01:29:26.470]
Let's see what she's got to grab you.

[01:29:26.470 --> 01:29:26.610]
Please, please, let me know.

[01:29:26.710 --> 01:29:28.810]
I'm gonna go over the rest of our four play list in a little bit.

[01:29:28.810 --> 01:29:29.690]
Oh, our four play list.

[01:29:29.870 --> 01:29:33.250]
It's so many terrific suggestions last night regarding four play.

[01:29:33.770 --> 01:29:34.010]
Oh.

[01:29:34.570 --> 01:29:36.570]
Michelle, you're on real radio 1-0-4.1.

[01:29:37.350 --> 01:29:37.710]
Michelle.

[01:29:38.290 --> 01:29:39.050]
Come on, Michelle.

[01:29:39.170 --> 01:29:39.530]
What's your up?

[01:29:39.530 --> 01:29:40.590]
Hi, Erin.

[01:29:40.830 --> 01:29:43.130]
I'm a long time with Erin, a first time caller.

[01:29:43.350 --> 01:29:44.050]
Oh, that's a rich one.

[01:29:44.110 --> 01:29:44.730]
Compassion fine.

[01:29:44.930 --> 01:29:45.450]
Thank you.

[01:29:45.890 --> 01:29:47.370]
I just wanted to comment on her.

[01:29:47.570 --> 01:29:49.930]
So you had, I don't remember how long ago it was.

[01:29:50.050 --> 01:29:50.930]
I think it was a couple weeks ago.

[01:29:51.690 --> 01:29:53.730]
And actually my boyfriend suggested it.

[01:29:54.170 --> 01:29:57.130]
He had mentioned water masturbation.

[01:29:57.230 --> 01:29:57.870]
Oh, my God.

[01:29:58.450 --> 01:30:01.290]
And I said, you know, he said, hey, just try it.

[01:30:01.310 --> 01:30:02.470]
You know, see what you think about it.

[01:30:02.490 --> 01:30:03.070]
I said, okay.

[01:30:03.430 --> 01:30:05.690]
And my parents had already had this.

[01:30:05.690 --> 01:30:06.770]
I think she's peddling up screen.

[01:30:06.770 --> 01:30:07.750]
I tried theirs.

[01:30:08.470 --> 01:30:09.730]
And it worked great.

[01:30:09.950 --> 01:30:11.070]
I just wanted to tell everything out there.

[01:30:11.990 --> 01:30:13.030]
I'm telling you, Michelle.

[01:30:13.290 --> 01:30:14.830]
Now, who's the one that's supposed to get off on it?

[01:30:14.910 --> 01:30:16.170]
I thought it was the caller, not Erin.

[01:30:16.230 --> 01:30:17.330]
I think we'll use your hand.

[01:30:17.830 --> 01:30:18.770]
But you can use hand.

[01:30:18.950 --> 01:30:19.690]
You can use a toy.

[01:30:19.730 --> 01:30:20.130]
Oh, yes.

[01:30:20.650 --> 01:30:25.690]
And most women are most easily reaching orgasm through water masturbation.

[01:30:26.530 --> 01:30:26.810]
I know.

[01:30:26.930 --> 01:30:27.330]
It's great.

[01:30:27.570 --> 01:30:30.150]
I mean, I was like, you know, and what was great is that you can do that.

[01:30:30.150 --> 01:30:34.270]
So next time you were in a shopping center, you see women like kind of squatting over the water fountain.

[01:30:34.270 --> 01:30:35.270]
Like you would have rid of that.

[01:30:35.270 --> 01:30:37.410]
Turn that disgusting perverted stuff off.

[01:30:38.310 --> 01:30:39.530]
Three coins in your mountain.

[01:30:39.630 --> 01:30:40.370]
Is that what you was singing?

[01:30:40.830 --> 01:30:41.670]
Oh, here's Johnny Dark.

[01:30:41.790 --> 01:30:42.350]
That's funny.

[01:30:42.510 --> 01:30:44.990]
He coincents and said that's the first song they're playing on the coast of saffron.

[01:30:45.070 --> 01:30:46.570]
Three coins in a fountain with the Ames brothers.

[01:30:47.250 --> 01:30:48.630]
Little format change over there.

[01:30:48.650 --> 01:30:49.970]
But he's a daft of well, he's easy.

[01:30:49.970 --> 01:30:51.570]
He said, I'll play whatever kind of crap they want.

[01:30:51.990 --> 01:30:53.270]
Here's Hollywood on the Star Line.

[01:30:53.290 --> 01:30:53.510]
Hello.

[01:30:53.770 --> 01:30:54.850]
What the hell was that?

[01:30:55.270 --> 01:30:55.830]
What was what?

[01:30:55.910 --> 01:30:56.730]
Water masturbation.

[01:30:56.850 --> 01:30:58.630]
That was the shout-power, power shower.

[01:30:58.930 --> 01:30:59.110]
What?

[01:30:59.110 --> 01:31:00.250]
Man, it's like some...

[01:31:00.250 --> 01:31:00.950]
You jackass.

[01:31:01.130 --> 01:31:01.430]
Watch out.

[01:31:01.550 --> 01:31:01.970]
It's going to be wet.

[01:31:01.970 --> 01:31:02.450]
Yeah.

[01:31:02.630 --> 01:31:04.990]
That guy was a butt player to call out about who's playing with who.

[01:31:05.110 --> 01:31:06.010]
I think he's playing with himself.

[01:31:06.170 --> 01:31:06.810]
Which one was that?

[01:31:06.890 --> 01:31:08.050]
Not the football about San Diego.

[01:31:08.550 --> 01:31:11.050]
We got more problems where we're about this week and we're losing some players.

[01:31:11.230 --> 01:31:12.470]
Halleer's not going to play maybe.

[01:31:12.650 --> 01:31:12.830]
Yeah.

[01:31:14.010 --> 01:31:15.030]
And Ingraham's not playing?

[01:31:15.210 --> 01:31:15.810]
Ingraham, yeah.

[01:31:16.710 --> 01:31:17.030]
She's.

[01:31:17.070 --> 01:31:18.430]
And that's after a book.

[01:31:20.090 --> 01:31:20.690]
That's all he's got.

[01:31:20.690 --> 01:31:21.350]
Oh, she's.

[01:31:21.430 --> 01:31:21.570]
Yeah.

[01:31:21.790 --> 01:31:23.330]
That's telling we got a lack of it as it is.

[01:31:23.470 --> 01:31:23.670]
Right.

[01:31:23.870 --> 01:31:24.630]
Hopefully three in a row.

[01:31:24.850 --> 01:31:26.490]
I think there's no problem with Kansas City.

[01:31:26.530 --> 01:31:27.190]
I'm just telling you that.

[01:31:27.330 --> 01:31:28.730]
Like I said, it's an objective pun.

[01:31:28.810 --> 01:31:29.630]
I'm telling you right now.

[01:31:29.790 --> 01:31:30.690]
Kansas City sucks.

[01:31:30.690 --> 01:31:31.450]
They got no defense.

[01:31:31.590 --> 01:31:32.450]
Well, hopefully we get a lot of defense.

[01:31:32.450 --> 01:31:34.870]
The English with no defense shouldn't be in the playoffs in the first place.

[01:31:34.890 --> 01:31:36.710]
You heard Neil Smith talking about that defense.

[01:31:36.890 --> 01:31:37.210]
Yeah.

[01:31:37.210 --> 01:31:38.550]
That Halleer couldn't handle his jockstrap.

[01:31:38.670 --> 01:31:38.850]
Talk.

[01:31:38.970 --> 01:31:39.810]
Don't get the job done.

[01:31:39.810 --> 01:31:40.350]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:31:40.590 --> 01:31:41.550]
Well, see this weekend.

[01:31:41.650 --> 01:31:42.690]
I'll tell you they can't do it.

[01:31:42.830 --> 01:31:45.930]
If you remember that first Kansas City game, they can't tackle anybody.

[01:31:46.210 --> 01:31:47.590]
They cannot tackle anybody.

[01:31:47.730 --> 01:31:48.890]
They need crazy glue.

[01:31:48.910 --> 01:31:49.610]
They need stick them.

[01:31:49.670 --> 01:31:51.830]
Maybe Aaron can get some honey for these guys.

[01:31:51.910 --> 01:31:52.850]
A little honey on the finger.

[01:31:53.030 --> 01:31:53.610]
Too much water.

[01:31:54.010 --> 01:31:54.290]
Exit.

[01:31:54.350 --> 01:31:54.770]
There you go.

[01:31:54.930 --> 01:31:55.250]
All right.

[01:31:55.270 --> 01:31:55.970]
Now I have a happy new year.

[01:31:56.010 --> 01:31:56.570]
And back to you.

[01:31:57.790 --> 01:31:58.470]
That's what it is.

[01:31:58.470 --> 01:31:59.910]
There's too many power showers, baby.

[01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:00.750]
Check out.

[01:32:00.870 --> 01:32:01.070]
Yeah.

[01:32:02.450 --> 01:32:06.610]
So anyway, Jay Hyler is having a shower with the, are they having a bridal shower?

[01:32:06.910 --> 01:32:09.230]
Or is he just taking a shower with the whole staff over there, Jay Hyler?

[01:32:09.230 --> 01:32:09.990]
All the news guys.

[01:32:11.250 --> 01:32:13.430]
I hear that he just backed into that job.

[01:32:13.530 --> 01:32:14.630]
Is sports directors, that true?

[01:32:18.710 --> 01:32:19.430]
Oh, God.

[01:32:19.650 --> 01:32:21.930]
Don't tell me there's a pipe bomb in my card outside of there.

[01:32:22.210 --> 01:32:22.870]
Come on, Jay.

[01:32:22.910 --> 01:32:23.950]
It's just a radio show.

[01:32:24.170 --> 01:32:24.530]
Wait a minute.

[01:32:24.650 --> 01:32:25.810]
Tell you what Dan Stewart told me.

[01:32:26.450 --> 01:32:28.850]
Anyway, let me just pass these little tidbit.

[01:32:28.930 --> 01:32:30.090]
Now what was wrong with that?

[01:32:30.610 --> 01:32:31.810]
He hasn't known his for news.

[01:32:31.990 --> 01:32:33.090]
He's a news guy.

[01:32:33.810 --> 01:32:35.010]
He's a news guy.

[01:32:35.010 --> 01:32:38.290]
He happens to have rubbed elbows with some of the people over there at Channel 7.

[01:32:38.530 --> 01:32:39.330]
Elbows, I said.

[01:32:40.910 --> 01:32:42.130]
You ought to see the calluses.

[01:32:42.810 --> 01:32:43.030]
Okay.

[01:32:43.150 --> 01:32:43.690]
So anyway, what about.
