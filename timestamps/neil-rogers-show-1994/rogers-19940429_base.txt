[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.840]
What's up, buddy? Who's this this might be? How you doing Mike? All right, what's going on? We're proctoid man

[00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:11.480]
Huh? Where have you been all of our lives? Yeah, I've been around been doing cars working for Paul you've been doing Paul

[00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:17.140]
No cards. Don't let the word out. I know I tell you. Yeah, I'm either wrong guy to tell

[00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.900]
There's nobody listening. No worry about it. Well listen. It's nice to be head by a pound. Have a great life

[00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.400]
Hey, we owe you a free wash though. We're we're we're are you we're in a boat right now

[00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:32.840]
But I mean, where's your place? We move around we come to you. Oh you come to us and on you and you scrub it

[00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.660]
Okay, well listen come on down. Oh, well, let's just scrub it. Okay, if you find it you can scrub it

[00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.960]
All right, buddy. Have a great luck pal. See you get on here

[00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.640]
We have an open line on the starline star IOD and the a pound line is still there was somebody on there

[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.140]
But they're not holding we're paying for it. They're still not holding which just amazes me at pound IOD strange

[00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.880]
Here's the St. Petersburg. Hello. Hi Neil. Yes, sir

[00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.340]
A lot of people up here are pying around themselves, you know, they they can't handle it

[00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:04.920]
But I take a minute to explain what these these towed busters don't understand towed busters. Yeah, the towed buster

[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.460]
That's what I've been towed they

[00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.880]
What they don't realize is that two different areas your area is an area that is far from some level of

[00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:20.900]
Certification some not much a little bit. Yeah, you know, you can be mugged and shot by a guy that demands your money and any of seven different languages

[00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:28.080]
Right, that's true. We think you know a lot of people have worked last time here. Oh the lightning and so what you'll realize is the back of the program

[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.000]
It says thanks for visiting this Thunderdome. Don't forget your teeth

[00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.300]
Yeah, but all over here it says don't forget your teeth when you leave the restaurant

[00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.860]
Well, I'll let her the sound of that glass fizzing. That's always a good reminder. Yeah, they're a lot of dummies

[00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.160]
But they don't get yeah, you know and

[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.740]
Have another thing you'll realize about lightning game halfway through the third period they stop play for a few minutes

[00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:57.840]
So the announcer can say the floral city trailer park is now loading. Yeah, that's right before they start playing linear skinner

[00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.340]
That's right. Let's let Mrs. Cerella be escorted to the bus as she has a tendency to wander around

[00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.540]
Yeah, and the Thunderdome is in the middle of darky town. Yeah, it's

[00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:09.320]
Neil

[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.980]
Yeah, there were some good times there were some good times

[00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.460]
There were some interesting like when we came over there. We had some really good times. Oh the

[00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.960]
One of the mall appearance you had you on TV clear water mall was sensational

[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:26.820]
Absolutely, absolutely. Yeah, and a good time over there watching Kurt doing his drag routine and an empty restaurant

[00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.500]
That was exciting Randy got fan great

[00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.940]
Great meals at Donatello's and that the boss this place in St. Pete was dynamite

[00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.920]
Velvita just her foot. I think it was wasn't it all those great rides in Velvita's beautiful

[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:44.120]
Polychial car. I'll never forget those and a free hot dog at Mel free we need that's right

[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.260]
You can't get enough. We need around here, right so Neil. It's been fun. It's been real

[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.100]
But as my friend said as he walked out of the court

[00:02:53.660 --> 00:03:00.060]
There was some good times. There was some bad times but the marriage didn't work. Oh right have a knife. Yeah

[00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.200]
We have an open line on the green lines. It's farewell Friday for the West Coast

[00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.300]
It's been a real tweet Phil Henry will continue to be on over there by the way at least for the foreseeable future

[00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:10.940]
I don't see any problem with that

[00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:12.940]
I think he'll do just fine, especially on a station

[00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.780]
It's got like all the big numbers that they're going to have the rest of the day at least from six in the morning till two last

[00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.760]
It'll do alright. He'll be following something that kind of like fits in and I'm I'm not gonna even get into it

[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.760]
There's there's no point. I've said everything that needs to be said bitter disappointment

[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.560]
Nobody here is blaming it. Well, I won't say nobody here. I'm certainly not blaming him for you know

[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.280]
Whatever we didn't or didn't do over there

[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:39.140]
But just the whole ambiance and the attitude sucked and you know just vindictive and bitter basically is what it's all about

[00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:44.440]
So he'll get us. He'll work his way up to a two five two eight. He'll be all right. Here's Tampa. Hello

[00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:51.420]
Hey, how you doing? You're good sir. We're dying over here. Are you? Yeah, well, there's nothing left. I mean you just talked about the blobster

[00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:52.500]
Um

[00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:59.620]
There's there's not much there for people that are 35 or under or have much of a personality to listen to

[00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:04.820]
I'm dying out of here. We are and I don't blame me. I can't really logically argue

[00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:05.120]
uh

[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.580]
The decision because no it works out better for everybody like I said this

[00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:16.020]
I didn't realize until I talked to LV last night that they had this other thing in the works that they were going to put on six to eight instead of the tapes

[00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:20.220]
Which they realized that those tapes were killer and as long as they had that in the works they figure well

[00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:25.100]
We're you know kind of forward. You forced our hands and now we're gonna do it and they're gonna wind up way ahead of the game with it

[00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.360]
So this was planned and not flat together last minute exactly

[00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.080]
So it's not like I'm doing something out of spite

[00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:36.020]
I'm doing it because I needed for me here and uh they're going to be enforced to do it because it's gonna help them

[00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:40.320]
Yeah, I like I said logically there's not really an argument against it. Oh yeah

[00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:46.820]
I you were talking the other day about the share of this market and the country kind of aspect 20 percent

[00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:50.040]
Well, I came up here from Miami one of the first things I noticed was

[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:55.100]
You kind of replaced the heavy Latin influence of South Florida with a real heavy red neck influence here. Yeah

[00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:59.560]
You draw a lot of glue. It was completely yet there but you know it draw a lot of uh

[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.960]
It's draw here. It's not a lot of nose figures. Yeah, so it's unfortunate. We're gonna miss it though

[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:09.380]
Well, I appreciated pal one dying request a shameless dying request and keep one finger loose at all times. Yes

[00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:15.320]
Just a couple of Harry parts. We love those. Okay. Thanks a lot and you're a douchebag. Yeah

[00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.560]
We have an open line on the green line. It won't last for long

[00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.640]
There are all these closet people now coming out of the closet to say farewell and hey Neil

[00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:30.520]
Fuck you and that too. Here's St. Petersburg. Hello. Hello Neil. Yes. How you doing, pal? I'm doing great

[00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:33.540]
We have an open line on the green line

[00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:36.880]
Well

[00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:40.380]
That was cute

[00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:45.240]
But I just can't chance you know, I guess I could have put him on hold but why bother

[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.080]
Anyway, we won't have any shortage of calls on the green line in fact

[00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:53.480]
We've never had any shortage of calls on the green lines very rarely like once in a blue moon or once

[00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:54.540]
You know once in a while when

[00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:01.860]
Selinsky started patching around with the tower with a transmitter and they were like on six watts going straight into the gulf

[00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:08.280]
But other than that they were smoking. I will say that thank you at least for keeping a phone smoking last almost two years

[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:12.120]
They may not listen in large numbers, but they sure do call

[00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:15.340]
Speaking of chronic by the way, here's a facts from KC in St. Pete

[00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:20.760]
I'm not even upset with him today as chronic as he is and he really is to a point of nausea

[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:25.520]
But here's the facts it says in augural meeting of the no-near Rogers on the radio support group in other words

[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:30.860]
We have no life as what he's trying to say Monday 7 to 10 pm at crystal restaurant on Northdale, maybe in Tampa

[00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:40.240]
Topics to be discussed one satellite dish purchase two moving to South Florida. Oh, please don't do that three GE super radio and four getting a life

[00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:41.420]
talking

[00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:44.900]

[00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:49.700]
We may suck, but we're like 511 11 one another big one yesterday in front of 20

[00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:55.000]
5 or 26,000 people or whatever it allegedly was allegedly was like 30 some but trust me

[00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:57.180]
Here's for lottery. Hello

[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.980]
Hey, Neil. How you doing pretty good sir? I was

[00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:06.220]
I was listening yesterday to Rick Rally's crappy promotion from the witbred

[00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:10.380]
Reception area now wet my pants. Yeah, terrible

[00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:15.000]
He didn't even do any homework. I don't know who does promotions offers Rick really

[00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:16.840]
Rick's idea

[00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:23.860]
But the I need help yeah, he does yeah, the reception area wasn't even open until 10 o'clock

[00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:28.160]
Yeah, and they had a guy walking around saying just nobody here. Oh, we're famous for that

[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:31.640]
We've this station has sent out more guys including Alex Bennett who deserved it

[00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:36.740]
I remember forget he they sent him to do a remote at the home show on the beach and there was nobody there

[00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:38.620]
I don't know yet place wasn't open yet

[00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:41.780]
Not to mention the garlic festival right the garlic festival was done

[00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:44.380]
I might I mean that wasn't on the air, but it should have been that was special

[00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:50.000]
That was with Tom Denimberg's parting shot to me. Let's see if we can help him get in the mongue here to add to the bells paulsy

[00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:55.020]
Unbelievable. I mean my wiener doesn't whistle. Yeah, right. Well, he could have whistled yesterday

[00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:59.840]
And then nobody would have heard it. I didn't even know he did a thing. Oh you who was out there

[00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:01.900]
Uh Marvin Chris

[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:06.720]
One of the outside flunkies was out there. Yeah, well, that's a good way to indoctrinate him

[00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:09.700]
Right sent him out to a place where there are no people and do a show

[00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:15.540]
It's like I said like that thing I went over to see a Kurt over in Tampa doing his drag routine in an empty restaurant

[00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:18.080]
There were like five people there and there were all friends and relatives nobody

[00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:22.620]
So we're used to it unbelievable. I think closing. I want to say

[00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:28.360]
What is a godsamishmaka have a great life pali back a godsamishmaka

[00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:29.280]

[00:08:55.380 --> 00:09:01.220]
The hockey games last year the Leafs wiping up the ice with lightning twice and the old the barn out there

[00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:08.060]
And then again this year that gigantic record breaking crowd for the home opener over there as the panther shut out the lightning to nothing as I recall

[00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:11.900]
In front of almost 29,000 people and then the leaf shutting out the lightning

[00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:15.380]
How come every time I went over there they like almost couldn't score

We don't have our Spanish interpreter here today

[00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:26.900]
He's home nursing his wounds getting sick in plenty of time for tomorrow's stone soul picnic

So anyway, I come in this morning getting ready to the reason that they didn't sound quite as good as it should have and I apologize

But I'm coming to dub my stuff which it sounded real great on the cassette that I brought in trust me when I tell you and

1052 we have an open line and Broward 5249463 see this

[00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:45.380]
I don't I don't want to get myself in a bad mood because I'm gonna start thinking about this company in the way they do things and keep stringing along

[00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:48.160]
Let's sit like I said cut the cord get out with life uh

[00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:50.580]
Ron and Ron make all our stupid little unsipit comments

[00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:54.580]
I just had a spy report now. They can have a real woman on in midday over there. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

[00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:03.840]
But anyway now we can start like actually going back to like our own thing

[00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:08.260]
We don't have to pass the fine and you know like I said it's sad because there were a lot of really nice people over there

[00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:11.640]
There was no accident that we had those thousands of people at the clearwater mall

[00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:14.960]
I know that scared the crap out of Opie and now he's really gonna be scared

[00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:19.660]
See a lot of people would assume his reactions. Well, we chased that fat bag out of here bar. Well, no

[00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:24.700]
That's not the deal the deal is that I forced their hand and now they're gonna put on a show that is gonna kick ass

[00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:27.980]
It's gonna be a local show. It's gonna be a spin-off a show that's already kicking ass

[00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:32.420]
And they're gonna like they're gonna do it and they're gonna put FLA right in the toilet all the way across

[00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:36.620]
So thank me for that just remember that when you're like cussing in the bitching at me

[00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:40.880]
Just thank me for forcing them to butcher up and be a real goddamn radio station

[00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:48.180]
Okay, and you too last year you fat cow thank me okay? Because otherwise they'd let this go on as long as I'd have sat here and put up with it

[00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:54.880]
And I started playing like six little beast Miguel records just out of spite to him at about to 20 to two just to piss him off

[00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:56.260]
Except I wouldn't want to do it to Randy

[00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:59.500]

[00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:48.480]
But we got what I said about you the grandma's happy about that exactly

[00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:51.640]
Maybe she can write shotgun while Anne's driving the diesel truck well, maybe

[00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:54.340]
She can help her shift it. Yeah, listen

[00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:57.160]
She can give her hand on it

[00:18:57.160 --> 00:19:01.520]
Um today's this weekend maybe just one finger. Yes this weekend's a sad day

[00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:07.020]
At on the beach. The paragon club the paragon club is closing on sunday

[00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:12.560]
Prince bought it and he's putting up his grand slam club there. Paragon is closing well

[00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:18.420]
Prince bought paragon. Oh my god. What are all these queens gonna do now? They're gonna be screaming and screaming

[00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:22.980]
Man, but some of them already are right exactly many of them

[00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:31.960]
But um, I was wondering when you did you see Larry King the other night with um when he had the uh mr. Sauer put himself bob dole on

[00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:34.260]
Lonnie festilapas now I did not well

[00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:35.260]
He asked my stupid

[00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:43.580]
question that he goes what he says he says bob I've seen you in many arenas. What's it like for bob dole to cry?

[00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:50.920]
And bob dole moved to 10 and and just gave him this sour look and yeah

[00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:58.140]
And the guy that was sitting next to Larry looked at Larry's you like what the hell or yeah, what's your stupid question is that you slimy butt plug

[00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:00.560]
He has no power. I don't understand

[00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:04.780]
You notice by the way he's off for radio everywhere night time they weren't making any money

[00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:09.040]
They put him on daytime. He bobbed over another affiliates wanted to carry it and blow off their great local shows

[00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:13.320]
To put his skinny ass on air. So now it's strictly uh, but in the meantime he's making millions of dollars

[00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:16.600]
And probably still losing the ball of the track. Is that right? He's still a piece of gold

[00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:19.680]
That whole thing. He can be making a hundred million and he's still a piece of garbage

[00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:25.580]
And we know it here in Miami better than anybody in the world exactly. Well, um, I have a request

[00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:32.900]
Yes, I want to call somebody a douchebag. Uh-huh Dan. I want to call a douchebag and um

[00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:35.640]
Yes, okay, all right see

[00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:36.820]
Yeah

[00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:45.140]
He's spoiled it. We have an open line in date 7519 463 here south Miami. No gone. I'm just it south Miami

[00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:47.040]
Here's Orlando on a mobile hello

Good morning. Yeah, man. Well, thank you. Wait a visit to you

[00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:58.280]

[00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:02.000]

[00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:07.880]

[00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:09.600]
Yeah, certainly. Uh-huh, certainly

[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:13.200]
Beautiful. I didn't know if you'd be interested in that or not. I thought it was kind of a trooper

[00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:15.080]
Why not? There you go

[00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:17.700]
I was wondering if I could make a request that I'm not gonna get a

[00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:28.380]

Nice open line and Broward 5249 463 they're called from Orlando. They're called from uh

[00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:34.900]
Oki-Fanoki swamps

[00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:37.800]
They're called from all over the state. We'll probably get calls from New Orleans

[00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:41.740]
So the deal is we are going to keep the as far as I understand from what George said yesterday

[00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:48.520]
We're gonna leave the satellite on in the on position for those people who are listening on their s cpc on our satellites in Alaska and

Arizona and like the seven others whatever and then as soon as Cox Broadcasting puts something else on there

[00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:54.860]
Will be gone, but in the meantime we'll be here

[00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:57.420]

Okay, well he sounded depressed and a very morbid we have an open line on the a cell one line which is constant

[00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:44.300]
I think we're gonna have to rip that baby out. We're gonna have to reconstruct this whole reconfigure this whole thing here

[00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:50.780]
At pound iod and two and Broward of course five two four nine four six three. Here is the orlando again. Hello

[00:22:57.140 --> 00:23:03.420]
And probably last time call as well. I would imagine did I hear an ad a few minutes ago for

[00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:07.180]
I think it was Eckers where they would give my mother a pearl necklace

[00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:08.520]
What

[00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:13.980]

You know what I mean? Yeah, I do know what you mean. Yeah

[00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:17.840]
Anyways, um

[00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:26.180]
I think the worst thing is gonna happen to the city of Orlando. Yes, is that no one's gonna have any material to steal

[00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:27.200]
anymore

[00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:32.060]
That's the end of Jim Phillips. Yeah, I mean he's got guys calling and doing your

[00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:36.460]
Oh, and that kind of stuff. Are you serious? What a sleaze bag. You know

[00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:41.420]

[00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:31.900]
Open line on a green line 18944 goodbye and here's a hialia. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. Are you doing Neil? Very good

[00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:33.320]
Multibanny

[00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:40.260]
See I um I'm just calling because just a day I was listening to your show which I enjoy

[00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:47.160]
Of course you know of course what's not to like I'm not a hulio though. I'm on our burrito and I'm only half-stick the other half is

[00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:53.200]
Wap oh my crowd make a speak-wap friend. Yes, right as they said in the godfather now

[00:25:53.920 --> 00:26:00.680]
You have a large audience let me tell you a large large audience of sticks down here. No, make no mistake about that

[00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:06.940]
Again, I want to tell you I enjoy the hell out of your show. I've even got a bunch of Puerto Ricans listening out there

[00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:10.660]
Man who are big jury of Rivera fans and you can almost feel the grease coming through the speaker

[00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:17.740]
Boy you must you're like half Cuban and half Italian. Yeah, boys talk about grease

[00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:23.900]
Yeah, you must have to drain your hair every morning for half an hour real greasy and garlicky when in doubt ring it out

[00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:30.320]
Hey, by the way the West Coast sucks. Yeah, really thanks. You have a great day

[00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:32.860]
A lot of nice people lost over there, but it just needs some help

[00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:41.780]
Yeah, well keep up the good work and have a nice weekend and a great afternoon. Which is gracias. Take care yourself. See you

[00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:43.160]
Open line indeed

[00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:47.680]
751 see I'm even back to the seeers today because I've been such a good god damn mood

[00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:53.100]
We've been like a little depressed here to last the things have been like not all that good especially when we were like not

[00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:55.100]
No one which hand was wiping the other and

[00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:56.740]
What they were wiping it with

[00:26:57.380 --> 00:27:02.700]
By the way, Flora should be here any minute now. They're having that chicken lunch whatever they do that company thing down there

[00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:06.700]
So those people who want to eat the usual pedestrian fear that comes in down there go right ahead

[00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:09.520]
But I have a feeling we'll have some pretty damn good stuff here in a second

[00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:12.320]
12 minutes after 11 at WIOD and WSUN

[00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:18.660]
I just by the way did anybody hear sports talk last night and those incredible interviews with Defoe and Manage and the new dolphin draft choices

[00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:21.660]
But I tell you if brains count we're gonna like maybe not win a game all year

[00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:24.700]
Looks like we got a pretty soft schedule by the way if you see that schedule

[00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:28.500]
God looks like we play a bunch of American Legion teams next season. That should be pretty good

[00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:33.900]
But god almighty and two toes Tim bowens there. Do you hear him?

[00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:39.960]
I mean they kept like asking these making the questions longer and longer hoping to elicit the quest

[00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:44.880]
I just love football. I have been playing football. Yeah, I love being here

[00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:48.220]
Uh, but what about that accident what happened to that fight?

[00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:52.540]
I just uh, I have it to be here. You know, I can do with anybody else. I have it to be here

[00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:55.480]
At a boy, Timmy you tell a man. You'll fit right in here

[00:27:56.480 --> 00:28:03.360]
Anyway, let's let's give him a show north Miami. Hello. Yeah, Neil. Yes, sir. How are you doing? I'm the guy just going to the Luiz McGill site

[00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:12.240]
Oh, much as gracias. Any time man. Uh, I need to lodge a complaint see why are you taking out Luiz McGill? Uh oh

[00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:17.900]
I mean really yeah, she's maybe maybe she just moved until like after a noon or

[00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:22.740]
You know before they use a noon or something. Yeah, or my like 1230 or something. Yeah

[00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:27.440]
Yeah, I mean, you know, I think that's some nerve that these people have got taken our uh, Luis away

[00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:33.360]
That's right. Uh, that's the see I don't get that anyway now now maybe but maybe Randy's got a point when you play it at the end

[00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:38.900]
And it's like a punctuation like an exclamation point like that's the end of the show and those people are not all that crazy about it

[00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:42.060]
They like go elsewhere and they switch the dial around to do something else

[00:28:42.060 --> 00:28:42.980]
Then they forget to come back

[00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:47.540]
But if it's like a middle of the show, I mean they don't have some goddamn nerve to like switch away and not come back

[00:28:47.540 --> 00:28:50.680]
That's right right. Yeah, I think you got a point and

[00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:52.460]
Not it won't see I'm easy

[00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:54.880]
She should look at it as

[00:28:56.220 --> 00:29:02.240]
Enema at the end of the show you know with a little animal that's right. Here's the reason why he's experiencing and she gets brand new

[00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:06.220]
Brand new college so for a start have you ever checked out Australian rules?

[00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:10.260]
Uh, not for me. Are you sure why?

[00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:14.780]
No, I just you know all those guys running around in kiltzer whatever it is

[00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:17.240]
It'll catch your eye you know it'll catch my fly

[00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:19.640]
Well, I'll give a peek hey listen

[00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:23.280]
EC also wants to thank you for that tape because I loaned a turn she took it home over the weekend

[00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:26.620]
I had to ring it out when she gave it back to me. That's how soaked it was

[00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:29.580]
Oh great great

[00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:34.200]
Okay, well, I just love to say hello. Okay, Luis returns 1230

[00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:36.240]
I'm the case see ya

[00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:41.060]
Open line in date 751 and two and brown are not on a day that everything is just smoking here

[00:29:41.060 --> 00:29:45.880]
And this doesn't auger well for Monday. I'll tell you that I just sure hope I don't sit here on Monday

[00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:50.280]
Which ordinarily Monday sucks to begin with and then say oh jeez I think I made a bad mistake

[00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:57.820]
Because that'll really piss me off big time five two four w i o d and brown word part of the deal is that well

[00:29:57.820 --> 00:29:58.820]
We're worried about it on Monday

[00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:02.600]
Because they're gonna have to wait a long time today. I'll just tell you that right now

[00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:08.060]
It's not no waiting. It's lots of waiting because we got to get to these green lines and say goodbye to all our good friends

[00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:11.080]
They're gonna miss us so much, but first Miami. Hello

[00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:15.820]
Yeah, yes, sir. Hey, how are you Neil pretty good sir? Hey, how about them heat man?

[00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:19.900]
I bet he win a gal must forgot about that. Oh, he went to play off game last night

[00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:25.380]
But uh don't you think I think mine are kind of sucked there. I didn't pay. I was too busy with my maple leaves

[00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:32.500]
Yeah, man that guy that guy's somehow. Yeah, hey, I got a question for you. Yes, and you tell me the true or not. Okay. Yeah about that

[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.940]
Luis Miguel Rivera or whatever's name is ricky Rivera. Oh, yeah. Yeah

[00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:42.520]
They told me personally that he's a dick junkie

[00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:48.680]
Is that true? He likes Nixon. I don't know about his politics, but we'll find out well

[00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:52.560]
Maybe he attended the funeral the other night. He said he likes Nixon. Jason. Don't start getting nervous

[00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:55.960]
We have an open line in a day 75 what?

[00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:00.540]
Did he say he's a drug addict?

[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:06.340]
Something like that leave Luis alone. Don't start don't ever call us showing bad mouth Louise man

[00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:08.040]
You have something bad in your mouth fast

[00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:13.640]
Open line of dates 751. I think I just said that I'm just I'm telling you I got more adrenaline flowing

[00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:18.240]
It feels like I'm almost a born again here today. I feel like I'm alive like I got my life back

[00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:22.220]
All of a sudden I have no line just the opposite all contrary

[00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:28.220]
So anyway, I don't know 12 30. We'll see. Well, in fact, maybe when we play we'll see just how wide he opens his mouth

[00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:31.140]
It's 11 21 at W I O D and W S U N

[00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:35.860]

Who been like suck it in that s u n signal free all these last almost two years now?

[00:32:57.380 --> 00:32:59.380]
It really is almost two years. It's almost May

[00:32:59.380 --> 00:33:01.480]
We went on there and like the end of June

[00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:04.000]
I think two years ago so it's pretty damn close to two years

[00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:09.620]
And i'm pretty damn pumped up about it. Here's the keys on the poweline hello

[00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:12.360]
Good by yahu's

[00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:14.440]
Good by yahu's

[00:33:15.020 --> 00:33:19.720]
Good by yahu's put your finger back as you know

[00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:21.400]
Yes beauty

[00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:26.540]
Neil yes sir did you happen to catch Bob Dole the Nixon planting the other day?

[00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:30.660]
No, I did not. I was a beautiful thingy. See a cry and run off stage

[00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:34.360]
He was pl- uh planting it when they planted Nixon. Yeah

[00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:37.340]
Yeah, Bob Dole just lost it. He's by crying and said

[00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:41.920]
But God bless Richard Nixon and God blessed the United States. What do you know that?

[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:47.040]
Lardass always says one good fascist deserves another that's right right and then closing

[00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:49.500]
That's in between dutchland uber ollises. Yes

[00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:52.640]
Hey camp up. How do you see?

[00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:55.620]
Yeah, they're a little slow on that

[00:33:55.620 --> 00:33:58.900]
We have an open line on the a pound line cell iod or pound iod

[00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:05.860]
Just if you can't pound it sell it. That's what I always say pound iod or pound god like that one guy gets very upset and indignant if I don't say that

[00:34:06.340 --> 00:34:12.540]
Boy, I just it's like a cleansing like the air is cleaner in here is something. I know it's psychological but boy. It's like uh

[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:13.360]
man

[00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:18.280]
And one thing I want to say right now because I know that certain someone's i'm not going to mention any names

[00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:21.480]
They're probably going to be doing a lot of bad mouthing now and making all kinds of accusations

[00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:26.560]
But one thing i'm going to tell you right now and that is that i'm not saying anything different than I have last almost two years

[00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:30.560]
Which is probably one of the reasons that the one of many reasons this showed and go over that big

[00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:32.480]
I'm not going to say he's like oh god

[00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:38.580]
What a great place and man what a sophisticated great market and what tremendous people at what am I going to say that for

[00:34:38.580 --> 00:34:39.960]
I mean what kind of credibility?

[00:34:40.220 --> 00:34:42.740]
You have what you just suck around for the purpose of sucking around

[00:34:42.740 --> 00:34:49.400]
It's basically the whole most of the state is deep south yahu knows picking bible thump and phony baloney hypocritical

[00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:51.660]
Hard-ass country and that's it

[00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:53.320]
And

[00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:58.440]
We're tickled at that that we weeded out and found like like in the midst of all of that some real living and breathing people and that's great

[00:34:58.440 --> 00:34:59.320]
And we appreciate that

[00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:01.000]

Well, who's going to be filling your sweat filling my slot will be a show called the hooters on the radio

[00:35:17.180 --> 00:35:18.180]
It's a it is

[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:22.080]
I'm serial. I'm sorry. It's a spin off of the run and run network

[00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:28.740]
And it's going to include Lin Austin the hooter personality Lin Austin with her big hooters and Brenda Lee and

[00:35:29.180 --> 00:35:30.420]
Julie Williams and

[00:35:30.980 --> 00:35:35.500]
Fez douchebag probably and some of those run and run people and then of course the jason was just asking

[00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:43.040]
It's a good question. What will be on on the weekend? He asks out. I have a feeling like the best of the best of everything except me

[00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:45.180]
Yeah, we hate to see you guys

[00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:49.680]
Love you and take care. I appreciate it. Thanks for the memories. Okay. See you

[00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:53.380]
Boy, there's sounded a little modeling over there today. Well, that's the way it goes

[00:35:53.380 --> 00:35:56.420]
You get that loyal but small core you have a loyal small one

[00:35:57.040 --> 00:36:03.360]
Uh, let's go to lady. We haven't had like no ladies today. Here's a lady in Tampa calling on her dime. Hello

[00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:07.420]
Oh, Neil. We're dying over here. Are you? Yes. Get used to it. What's wrong?

[00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:13.440]
It'll be okay. Oh well, I'm going to Vegas. I'll get to see you. Are you going with us? That'll be great

[00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:17.160]
That's another reason the people from over there should go to Vegas. We can have like a little reunion with them

[00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:19.780]
Yes, it'll be so sad. Not a little bonding

[00:36:19.780 --> 00:36:24.620]
But I did get a GE super radio, but I can't pick up the station. No, it's too close to a 620

[00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:26.920]
Is it yeah, that's all like I was a blobbo

[00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:29.400]
If you can get a group of your friends together and knock their tower down

[00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:33.460]
It probably would come in a lot better coming real good. Yeah, a big better blobbo was under it

[00:36:33.460 --> 00:36:40.020]
Well, what can I say about him? Just a walk in Turdberger just a real bitter disappointment with this whole ambiance of his phony life

[00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:41.340]
But that's where it goes

[00:36:41.340 --> 00:36:44.520]
Yeah, but are we going to hear Louise Miguel today?

[00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:51.540]
1230 as a last last one for us. Oh, that's right. That would be the last one for the West Coast 1230 and a PM 1230 sharp

[00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:58.220]
Yes, and could I have one request anything you like today is like a very very loose Friday. I want to hear

[00:36:58.220 --> 00:36:59.860]

[00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:14.880]
