[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120]
Fairy King is they don't come any better than Neil Roger.

[00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.740]
I was riding on a train to Austin Texas

[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:23.060]
Oh where the very lovely lady does that next to mine

[00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:31.800]
What she got it with eats her, she has to buy what holds her sight

[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:39.660]
Brackdom I was more than happy too and now there's more I'd like to do

[00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.860]
I want to kiss her but Brackdom she won't let my age

[00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:51.820]
I want to whisper sweet nothings in her ears

[00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:58.080]
Brackdom Brackdom Brackdom I want to hold her behind

[00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:06.880]
A Brackload of doors and more I want to kiss her but she won't let me

[00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:14.280]
When she returned she said she was an actress

[00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:21.100]
She showed me an album of pictures of her opening

[00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:27.220]
Which she then said none Brackdom the same as when she could be

[00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:34.280]
But I could clearly see she was the kind of girl who stole and hearts

[00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:43.440]
She spent her rest on Brackdom I want to kiss her but she won't let me

[00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:06.240]
Brackdom Brackdom I want to kiss her but she won't let me

[00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.600]
Damn it I missed the buzz and had time to cry a lot

[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:15.000]
Jesus Brackdom I want to kiss her but Jesus in Italy

[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.120]
We're saying to sweet and we shared our tales Brackdom

[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.840]
But as my heart cries to leave her behind Brackdom

[00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:35.300]
Regrets are all I find because I hope that you're back here in the end

[00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:42.680]
Brackdom I want to kiss her but Brackdom she won't let me

[00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:49.860]
I want to whisper sweet nothings in her ears

[00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:55.200]
Brackdom Brackdom Brackdom Brackdom I want to hold her behind

[00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:12.380]
Brackdom I want to kiss her but Brackdom Brackdom I want to kiss her but she won't let me

[00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:17.920]
Now what is it about that word that gets everybody so weak, huh? Brackdom? What is the big deal with that word?

[00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.540]
I don't know I mean that's one of the words we can still say

[00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.440]
There's Rob Marciano on CNN he's got a twig or some branch

[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.840]
He's got a wait to see where he's going to stick it

[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.520]
Brackdom No, not in the mud

[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.480]
Rob Marciano on CNN that's bad

[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.740]
Anyway don't get me started now

[00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:38.480]
You're an Ojohn Prabhakatur and I know you're going to start

[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.000]
I can smell it

[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.340]
Who may I be ignoring you completely?

[00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:42.320]
Good excellent

[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.020]
So yesterday I must confess I can't tell a lie

[00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:46.480]
I could lie just to piss Chris off

[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.220]
I broke my May resolution when I had sugar fast

[00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.000]
Yeah I had a Hershey's almonds and toffee candy bar

[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.320]
Just one so I might say oh no so I'll talk to Ohno

[00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.160]
But it was good

[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.060]
And you know to prove how addictive this stuff is when you're...

[00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.240]
And it's a damn good thing I only ate the one when I came back in the house

[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:09.100]
Because if I were to eat and like coming across the street from the market

[00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.240]
I would have gone turn around and gone back out three more

[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.740]
So that business that you were saying before the show to me about

[00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:19.240]
You're not sure if it's actually a physical thing or if it's mental or...

[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:20.540]
It's physical

[00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:22.640]
It's a physiological thing man

[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.280]
When it hits your taste buds it's similar

[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.560]
Like with me I don't know about anybody else

[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.620]
With me I can go like hours and hours eat nothing I'm not hungry at all

[00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.500]
And then I'll have like anything even bacon

[00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:33.620]
Even something that's not carbs

[00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.240]
And all of a sudden it stimulates my appetite and I become voracious

[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.200]
I mean I'm hungry as a wild man

[00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.380]
Mind your mind your baby I just... that's just the way it is

[00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:47.600]
So you continue convincing yourself that it's only psychological and that we're all weak

[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:48.860]
And then they can different...

[00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:49.800]
But you know they can different

[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:49.840]
You know they can different

[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.220]
Strength baby! Stay alive!

[00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.120]
Let's take the fat people alive!

[00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:53.900]
That's our goal

[00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.040]
You let a chemical take control of your body

[00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:58.740]
Yeah, control of your egg panic

[00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:59.260]
Yeah exactly

[00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:00.620]
Like a weak pound

[00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:01.480]
Like a hulk of hunger

[00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:02.240]
Yeah, out of the hollow

[00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:05.800]
Well there you go, different substances for different folks

[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:06.440]
That's right

[00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:08.820]
By the way I apologize to many rectums in the beginning of the show

[00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:09.680]
But I figured why not?

[00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:10.640]
Because there really be too many

[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:11.800]
I guess not

[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.760]
I mean there's so many A-holes running around on the loose anyway so why not?

[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:17.780]
All the rectums all the time

[00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:20.820]
What's that voicemail where the guy says rectum?

[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.000]
You know what I'm talking about?

[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.240]
They're real sour old... oh yeah here it is

[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.080]
He'll Rogers I think is the perfect example of queer

[00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:32.140]
What is his purpose for his new show or his ugly show?

[00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.680]
He uses that word rectum every five minutes

[00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:35.280]
It's guys ready

[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:37.840]
He's never going to get past him

[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.440]
And now we want to audience because that

[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:43.400]
The town and the people that he's always complaining about are the only four

[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:44.480]
That was on the next round

[00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:47.520]
Eventually his rainfall drops so low

[00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.280]
You'll have to readjust this rectum

[00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:51.520]
Oh well hey he was a confetti

[00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:52.140]
He was a confetti

[00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:53.240]
And yeah

[00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.700]
Your ratings are so low

[00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.740]
No that's right they are pretty bad they're pretty weak

[00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:58.480]
But you know something?

[00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:01.240]
That five five is still a highest number on the station

[00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.640]
In spite of what some people are going through a sugar withdrawal

[00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.540]
They're going through a hyperglycemic of fits

[00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:10.040]
Are babbling around a building who can't read the numbers

[00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.200]
See you know one thing about me and you know this

[00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.040]
When you're talking about statistics

[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:18.360]
It's like in sports you know you're batting average

[00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:19.620]
Or whatever it is

[00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:21.080]
You won the lost record

[00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:24.000]
You can't lie about it because it's right there it's in print

[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.920]
It's available people can look it up and there it is

[00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.060]
Oh geez so he was lying about that

[00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:31.760]
So I mean I'm not saying I would never lie about anything

[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.060]
I sure as hell would but not about numbers

[00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:37.580]
One thing about ratings either you've got them or you don't

[00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:38.920]
And let me also say one other thing

[00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:41.340]
A rating book means very little

[00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:44.880]
Because knowing how the diaries go and how we get these wired diaries

[00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:46.640]
And skewered in the you know two or three families

[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:48.540]
And there's like three or four people put down

[00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:50.520]
Oh we listen to so and so every day

[00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:53.400]
Every minute of the day or a substance such a station every day

[00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.380]
It reminds me when I was I told you this story before

[00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:56.220]
It's really classic

[00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:00.880]
WRHC which was a daytime Spanish language radio station

[00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:02.800]
I don't know if they're still any day timers on the R&A

[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.260]
And there must be some I don't know college stations maybe

[00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.520]
But in other words it was on from sunrise to sunset

[00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:10.220]
And of course that changes every month depending on the time of the year

[00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:14.160]
So they would sign off like say in the winter time at five or five thirty in the evening

[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:17.640]
And the holios would get the diaries they would put down

[00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:21.000]
Diddo diddo diddo and they would put down they were listening all the way till midnight every day

[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.460]
The only problem is the station would be signing off the year five thirty or six o'clock at night

[00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:29.180]
So if anybody had any doubts that there was such a thing as wired phony diaries

[00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:31.860]
That's just the way it works and sometimes we get to benefit of it

[00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:34.040]
Sometimes we get screwed that's just the way it works

[00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:39.380]
So taking one month or one book and saying oh look we got a story we got a case that that's below me

[00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:40.620]
That's bioniman

[00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:47.180]
I just mentioned that in passing for all these all these instant experts who can't whose blood sugar is so high

[00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:49.420]
They're not indicating we the right numbers

[00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:50.160]
That was funny

[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:52.460]
And of course when you don't have any it's kind of hard to talk about them

[00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:54.280]
Anyway Hershey's almonds and toffee

[00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:56.380]
So you didn't stop me there you didn't interrupt

[00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:56.860]
Stop!

[00:07:57.700 --> 00:07:59.260]
I'm on's at Carmel

[00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:00.600]
See I don't know anything about French

[00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:07.520]
In Canada like I've told you before every product that has a label on it must be bilingual

[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:09.200]
And bisexual

[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:09.580]
Yes

[00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:11.800]
It must be in English and in French

[00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:13.560]
And I don't know in French

[00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:17.480]
I mean I know maybe La Prume de Matin probably go French commentale-vous

[00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:19.000]
Amoui-bien Merci

[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.480]
No not Moui-bien, that's Spanish

[00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:22.400]
What did you say?

[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:23.120]
Huh?

[00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:23.860]
What did you say?

[00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:25.760]
How do you say in French very well?

[00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:27.640]
Who it means?

[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:28.400]
Yeah

[00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:29.880]
I don't know

[00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:32.020]
Is it Moui-bien Spanish?

[00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:32.580]
Yes

[00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:33.740]
I don't know in French

[00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:34.000]
Yeah

[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.980]
And that's the same French good is bon bon bon

[00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:40.480]
No, bonjourno is the time

[00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:42.500]
It's all the same crap

[00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:45.220]
I would tell all these people speak English and make it easy for us

[00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:45.460]
Exactly

[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:51.360]
Well I did learn a lot of the language and it was English so if I can do it anybody can

[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:53.340]
Now I would agree with that

[00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:55.680]
Amoui-bien French

[00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:59.540]
A la cremour avec, avec, avec, avec, I know means with

[00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:00.920]
See there's another word I know, avec

[00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:03.400]
From the hockey games they just listen to in French avec

[00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:04.940]
With René La Cabille

[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:06.680]
From Moulinog

[00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:09.400]
Oh God, I just don't give me started on the French

[00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:14.140]
And then on the bottom here I could read the contents in English and in French

[00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:18.360]
I think that's what we ought to do is make everybody in South Florida learn from say

[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:26.700]
Because when the frogs come down from Montfriol from Quebec in a season then you can get all cosy with them

[00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:28.680]
You know with their speedos and all other crap

[00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:29.760]
Oh God, yeah

[00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:35.720]
Speedy with disgusting, nasty, cheap, probably we'll go, probably we'll get lost

[00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:38.740]
That's the best thing to tell the frogs when they come to Dainier and the Hallendale

[00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:40.180]
Places like that and Hollywood

[00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:42.820]
In fact, probably not far from where you're hanging out

[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:43.680]
Right

[00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:45.800]
Just send them back to Quebec

[00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:47.800]
We don't have a lot of frogs here in Ontario

[00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:50.940]
Thank God, I don't think they're allowed when you come right, except maybe in Ottawa

[00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:55.600]
See Ottawa is right there I think on the fringe between Ontario and Quebec

[00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:58.400]
Between the provinces so even though it's the capital of Ontario

[00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:00.140]
It never less has got plenty of frogs

[00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:02.620]
Probably who, yeah

[00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:04.520]
It just goes with the territory

[00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:07.420]
Oh guess who died Diego Corralis speaking of Julios

[00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:09.940]
I have no idea who he was, but he's dead

[00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:15.020]
He's a former World Champion boxer who scored one of the most memorable knockouts in boxing history

[00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:18.120]
He died yesterday in a three-veh-collection in his Las Vegas home

[00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:19.320]
Did I mention it's Woodbine Tuesday?

[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:21.640]
I'm gonna have a Woodbine Thursday not on the year I didn't did I?

[00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:22.240]
Well it is

[00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:25.020]
You have a gambling problem there

[00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:28.100]
No, you've got a mind-your-own-business problem, anybody who would call me and tell me that

[00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:30.440]
Mind your own business, I have no gambling problem

[00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:35.160]
But you know, we got every five minutes

[00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:38.040]
There's some other yin-ta out there telling us all how to live our lives

[00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:40.740]
That's the worst thing about the condo commandos

[00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:41.940]
They can't mind their own business

[00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:43.640]
Basically because they have no business

[00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:44.260]
I have no life

[00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:47.380]
Right, so they got a mind everybody else has been sticking their nose in your business

[00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:49.800]
Sticking their nose in your rectum

[00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:51.840]
And not like in the odor either, probably not

[00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:59.060]
Corralis was driving a 2007 Suzuki 1000 motorcycle traveling northbound on Fort Apache road in the Southwest part of Vegas

[00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:02.380]
When inexplicably struck the back of a 97 Honda Accord

[00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:06.280]
Las Vegas police spokesman Sarge and Tracy McDonald said inexplicably

[00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:11.060]
Hmm, McDonald said the motorcycle convened in the southbound lane at some point he was tossed off the bike

[00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:15.520]
A 2000 former city's Ben's traveling in the southbound lane was unable to break in time

[00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:22.260]
McDonald said the driver who was not identified was unable to avoid striking the motorcycle and possibly the operator of the motorcycle also

[00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:27.200]
Diego Connellus lived in an ex-game lifestyle, his promoter Gary Shaw said he was a true warrior

[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:31.120]
He did everything hard and fast, he loved anything to the extreme and now he died an extreme

[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:31.540]
Extreme!

[00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:32.300]
Death

[00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:36.160]
He died an extreme death on this motorcycle, he was only 29

[00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:38.780]
And he probably wasn't even fat, I'm sure he wasn't

[00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:42.820]
That's why I keep saying that to try to get the Chris under, you know, so I cheated on the thing

[00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:43.400]
But you know something?

[00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:45.640]
So I didn't have beaten myself up about it

[00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:49.880]
And my blood sugar is nice and low this morning, I'm still alive and I sound like me, I sound like I feel great

[00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:52.900]
I'm ready for a big wood buying Tuesday and a wood buying Thursday

[00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:57.800]
Because we get out of here, by the way, did somebody straighten clearance out on the ball game time and give him a spanking moment?

[00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:58.940]
Yeah, I told him he said he'll run

[00:11:58.940 --> 00:11:59.640]
What did he say?

[00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:00.340]
What did he say?

[00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:01.360]
I'd like to know what he said

[00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:03.760]
He'd be like, yeah, I know about that, I'm taking care of it

[00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:06.620]
He's taking care of it

[00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:10.840]
Yeah, I mean, somebody needs to take care of him, somebody needs to get out the old

[00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:16.000]
What did he used to do with the colors things?

[00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:17.140]
A stick?

[00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:19.040]
No, not a stick, he used to

[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:19.580]
A stick

[00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:21.080]
A switch, that's it

[00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:24.360]
They need to get out of a switch and beat his ass

[00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:25.480]
I mean, his...

[00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:26.380]
That clearance

[00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:28.440]
Can't even get the name ball games on

[00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:30.060]
I mean, come on, clearance, where do you please?

[00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:32.100]
We got the one day idea we got out here at 1130

[00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:33.300]
That's probably why he's upset

[00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:37.240]
Now, if we had a UN basketball game on it, he was on, then he'd be all excited about it

[00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:39.340]
Oh yeah, hoops, we got Keynes hoops

[00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:43.700]
I think we got to subtract that from the ratings from whatever I...

[00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:46.080]
In a winner book, subtract those days, please

[00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:48.120]
It's all you, clearance, thank you

[00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:51.540]
I mean, if we had anything more than a eight-eyed beat shot than those two days

[00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:54.480]
But nevertheless, and Mad Dog also got to hammered with that too

[00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:57.100]
He got hammered with it

[00:12:57.100 --> 00:12:59.780]
I know that, 45 hour, whose idea was that, by the way?

[00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:00.740]
Hell, good

[00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:12.220]
Thinking you're forecalling the Cheryl Pro toilet paper abuse outline

[00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:14.480]
It is the very cycling your TP

[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:16.600]
You know TP does have two sides

[00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:18.540]
If you are wanting to report

[00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:21.840]
Someone using two whole toilet paper squares

[00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:24.340]
When going for dokey, please depressing one

[00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:29.800]
If someone is using three squares of TP, please depressing three

[00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:34.520]
And if you are knowing someone, who is so ecologically irresponsible

[00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:37.480]
Has to be using more than three squares

[00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:40.100]
Someone who thinks his patoki doesn't think

[00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:43.300]
They are to be a serious medical problem with them

[00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:45.080]
What is wrong with you people?

[00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:47.640]
In my country we don't even have toilet paper

[00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:49.200]
We don't even have toilets

[00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:53.280]
All we have is a stick in your hood and a clown vehicle Pakistan

[00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:55.480]
The shim of your self-sufficiency people

[00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:57.120]
Thank you for calling

[00:13:58.040 --> 00:13:59.620]
I'll tell you who knows their TP, man

[00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:00.480]
You know who it is?

[00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:03.040]
No, the engines, you know from TP believe me

[00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:06.660]
Yeah, I think they're, you know, I was thinking about that yesterday

[00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:08.400]
I was thinking that if there was a god

[00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:10.500]
Nobody would ever have screaming diarrhea

[00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:11.280]
You know what I mean?

[00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:13.040]
Or if it's a cruel god

[00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:14.340]
Or if he's in the dream

[00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:18.840]
This god, this god man invented is a sadistic bastard like the people who invented him

[00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:19.080]
Sure

[00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:21.000]
A sadist of the worst kind

[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.860]
That's why he's always getting pissed off

[00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:26.280]
And we got the plagues, we got the, we got the bubonic plague

[00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:28.300]
And we got the locusts and we got the floods

[00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:30.280]
And people are drowning and dying over here

[00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:32.980]
And he just gets pissed off his wrath waxes on

[00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:34.540]
Even though he's supposed to be perfect, you know

[00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:35.460]
Hot wax

[00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:36.880]
Ha ha ha

[00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:38.200]
House of wax with instant price

[00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:40.140]
And then we made that too and I have no idea

[00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:41.880]
They remake everything, they have no imagination

[00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:43.240]
What is wrong with these people?

[00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:45.400]
They made that every good poll we've done it before

[00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:46.160]
But I do like that

[00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:49.600]
The worst remake, the most needless remake or the worst remake movie

[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:50.040]
Sure

[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:51.020]
One of Stranger calls

[00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:51.820]
Psycho

[00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:52.220]
Psycho

[00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:52.420]
Right

[00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:55.100]
Cape Fear

[00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:55.540]
Mm-hmm

[00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:56.480]
All of these

[00:14:57.180 --> 00:14:57.940]
Kiss before dying

[00:14:57.940 --> 00:14:58.520]
Things

[00:14:58.520 --> 00:14:59.900]
Kiss before dying

[00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:01.760]
Robert Ragnar was really good

[00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:03.640]
Well he, well I don't want to go into it

[00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:04.320]
It's too good

[00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:05.540]
Yeah, yeah

[00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:08.420]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

[00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:10.160]
As they say in Paris, Gavac

[00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:13.860]
Okay, let's take a look at the, let's not start with that French stuff

[00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:17.200]
Okay, let's try to have at least one station in the market where somebody speak it English

[00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:18.120]
Speak it English

[00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:18.760]
Speak it English

[00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:22.280]
We got a new deal now, it started yesterday, we got cars calling in an esponule

[00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:22.920]
That's the new thing

[00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:25.000]
That's how bad things are getting itself Florida

[00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:28.940]
Even on the English language radio station, maybe that's what we ought to try to do

[00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:30.180]
Bisexual and bilingual

[00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:31.960]
Sure work for Cape House of USA

[00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:35.380]
Cape House of USA, that's my buddy at Rarchie S.A. Barillo

[00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:35.640]
Right

[00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:36.660]
A.K.A. Stephen Vauer

[00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:38.160]
We call the show Cape House on the Orojas

[00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:38.980]
New Orojas

[00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:40.280]
New Orojas

[00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:41.220]
Mr. Orojas

[00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:44.340]
The postmaster is not supposed to give his opinion

[00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:45.820]
Yeah, those are actually in here

[00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:47.120]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

[00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:47.160]
Yeah

[00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:50.000]
That's an actual call for some old bitch

[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.920]
Some old Juliette bitch

[00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:53.280]
Mr. Orojas

[00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:55.760]
The postmaster is not supposed to give his opinion

[00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:58.760]
I said I got an opinion hunting up your ass bitch, it lost

[00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:01.000]
What's the best thing Italy's given the world?

[00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:04.760]
And you know, I got a very hostile email on my my space about that saying

[00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:08.220]
Leonardo da Vinci wasn't enough, I think Larry was the guy's name, whatever they mean

[00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:09.360]
What I'm talking about

[00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:09.640]
That's what

[00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:10.780]
Nothing like that

[00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:13.620]
No, the only thing that backs us were coming in, you know, what stuff we forgot

[00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:18.740]
It's just for fun, it's just I mean these people, oh you can always rip up about the poll

[00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:21.820]
No, we don't, we don't give a flying fart about it, how do you like that?

[00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:27.100]
If we did, you guys should get pretty pissed off about that about flying fart, especially if they fly on the earth

[00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:33.620]
And he also said how about Leo da Camprio and I just messaged him back, I said no Leo's allowed

[00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:36.820]
And that kind of like was a catcher, you know, it took care of all that business

[00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:39.240]
No Leo da Vinci, no Leo da Camprio

[00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:41.360]
I always think of them in the same, you know

[00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:42.240]
Oh yeah

[00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:44.180]
What's the best thing Italy's given the world?

[00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:47.800]
1341 votes, great food, 499

[00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:49.800]
I mean nothing even close, mind your magic

[00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:54.120]
Yeah, one thing, you'll find some people don't like chinks, Chinese food, and some people don't like

[00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:57.120]
Yeah, various kinds of foods, seafood

[00:16:57.820 --> 00:17:00.600]
But have you ever met anybody who doesn't like Italian food?

[00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:03.860]
Thinkin', thinkin', thinkin' no

[00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:04.640]
Chris?

[00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:05.940]
No

[00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:05.940]

[00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:08.520]
It's just, I never heard of any such person

[00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:11.180]
Anybody out there who doesn't like Italian food?

[00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:13.760]
First of all, what's not to like pasta, tomato sauce and cheese?

[00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:16.520]
Pasta, pizza, Vio, pizza

[00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:17.360]
Oh, fuck me!

[00:17:17.860 --> 00:17:20.400]
All of these things, Vio, 499

[00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:23.280]
Oh yeah, Vio, probably Vio, Vio, Marcella, Vio, whatever

[00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:24.960]
I'm not curfewing them

[00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:30.380]
So Vio, around 165 speaking of luscious things, so the heteroes would say

[00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:34.360]
All you heteroes out there feeding the early Christians lines, 159

[00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:38.220]
And they did a very poor job of it, which is why we have so many goyem in the world today

[00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:42.720]
The Renaissance 113, the Mafia 91, should have been much higher than that

[00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:47.680]
The Mafia only 91, and the other some people would say, oh, the Mafia is something bad

[00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:50.400]
It seems like that, they think it's only

[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:52.900]
So even the Mafia like their good food, man, they love it

[00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:55.400]
Man, Jamanja, mom ate a little supper

[00:17:56.140 --> 00:17:59.400]
The Roman Empire 58, Michael Angelo and his art, hey Michael

[00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:01.420]
You're fair, Angelo, 45

[00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:03.600]
Awesome ancient ruins, 45

[00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:06.920]
Next time you go to Rome, George, you're going to really be impressed when you go to Ilkola

[00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:07.800]
Say it, wait

[00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:13.240]
I mean, it's really a shame, I don't think that anybody, this is the problem with so many

[00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:17.220]
Perocchio people in South Florida who don't have unapaceable, and don't go anywhere at Dine

[00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:19.080]
Or at Dine to go there

[00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:20.760]
Well, no, hitchike, hitchike across the island

[00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:22.280]
Yeah, yeah, I'll effort hitchike

[00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:25.620]
There's a, there's a flotil, leaving it about two this afternoon

[00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:26.920]
Or at Tislai Tube

[00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:29.860]
I'll be on a way to Woodvine, you can be on a way to Italia

[00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:33.740]
Man, Jamanja, I'll give you all a good detractor ears to try out

[00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:39.220]
Mmm, Galileo 44, he didn't know squat, that's what the Pope used to say, and then the Pope said, well, I changed my mind

[00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:41.500]
Change my pantaloonies, and I changed my mind

[00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:43.640]
He never changed those red slippers though, I'll turn to that

[00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:46.360]
Even when he slept him around there, the slob on the slab

[00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:51.180]
They slept him around, he had those little tiny red slippers on, just like a real...

[00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:51.840]
You're fairy

[00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:56.060]
Fag, Sergio Leone, he's spaghetti westerns, 37, see there's spaghetti even in the movie

[00:18:56.060 --> 00:19:01.080]
See, everywhere you look, with it, it's food, food, we left out canole when we were reciting all the great Italian food

[00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:04.460]
Canolees and panzottis and all that stuff

[00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:06.600]
Christopher Columbus 15

[00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:11.660]
Is that the good, the bad, and the neorogers?

[00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:13.480]
Yes, that's what it is

[00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:16.900]
Since you mentioned spaghetti westerns, I know that

[00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:21.180]
Jesus 14, as in Jesus Christ, a beautiful language, we were...

[00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:24.300]
See, you know, Charlie, this pool wasn't that bad actually

[00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:27.500]
But I mean, a beautiful language, we were words like a Riveterchi

[00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:29.660]
What's beautiful about that word? Is that a beautiful word?

[00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:33.340]
It's actually a very hard word, it's got the hard C and R, Qi

[00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:35.680]
Riveterchi, C, Qi, Tromper

[00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:39.460]
Roman numerals 11, that's another stupid one

[00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:41.200]
What's the big sinus with Roman numerals?

[00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:43.840]
Why is that regular numbers? What would be the number of letters?

[00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:45.860]
Fine opera 11

[00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:49.360]
Right when pastar, it was like Mussolini and Bertasconi 9

[00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:51.540]
Tavarotti 6, oh I love saying that

[00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:53.780]
Tavarotti, you can really rule your Rs on that

[00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:55.180]
You get like a real buzz over that

[00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:57.240]
Tavarotti, just keep trying it, everybody with me

[00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:01.020]
Tavarotti, oh, and Julius Caesar only 5, he's still dead

[00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:04.460]
He was betrayed, just like we've been betrayed here at WQA

[00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:05.680]
You know what I mean? Be betrayed by

[00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:08.580]
some of our post-personal fat friends

[00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:10.540]
No, it's not a big deal, it's just

[00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:13.720]
Just a lot of people with big mouths and big puppets

[00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:15.680]
And you know, when your bluncher gets to be over 700

[00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:18.400]
You start waddling around saying a lot of really stupid things

[00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:21.340]
And then people come into our studio early in the morning before the show

[00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:22.280]
And they repeat those things

[00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:24.520]
And we get very ordinary and hostile

[00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:28.860]
And we start going on defensive and on the attack and talking about

[00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:29.320]
That was funny

[00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:33.200]
Now seriously, we need to have a campaign to keep him resuscitated him and keep him alive

[00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:36.200]
I didn't see Hank on the Derby thing on ESPN on Friday or Saturday

[00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:39.540]
But we had a spy report from your friend Joe

[00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:41.820]
And he said, you know what he said? He said

[00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:42.260]
Oh my god

[00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:42.540]
Yeah

[00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:44.620]
We need to do something

[00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:47.740]
I think what you need to do is shackle him, huh?

[00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:52.820]
I was just going to say because that's the only thing that we didn't do to the other fat friends or family members

[00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:53.860]
We just can't control, yeah

[00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:55.340]
Walk them in a dungeon somewhere

[00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:59.140]
What Joe and Crawford did with her kid, you know, she tied him behind the back and that kind of thing

[00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:02.060]
Although, with fat people, they could open the refrigerator

[00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:03.560]
Of course he doesn't have any food in the refrigerator

[00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:07.340]
We kind of embarrassing people in a restaurant with your hands tied behind your back

[00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:09.560]
And eat off the plate with your head

[00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:11.020]
No, it wouldn't

[00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:11.820]
I guess you're right

[00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:14.240]
Where there's a will, there's a way for you

[00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:16.080]
You walk alive for a session

[00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:20.780]
Here's the story of a football family

[00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:24.440]
That you'll get when you need a lot of girls

[00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:27.440]
You can give your lady gold

[00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:29.340]
Or some diamonds

[00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:32.440]
But don't release your girls

[00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:36.100]
Here's the story of that Tom Brady

[00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:40.080]
Who is busy giving every girl a phone

[00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:43.940]
Then one of them said, he'll be a father

[00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:46.700]
But she was not alone

[00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:50.660]
Then came one day when Tom Brady went to cowboy

[00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:54.600]
And he knew too many diamonds had been touched

[00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:58.640]
Now he's just months away from a football family

[00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:02.180]
In break-made it when they rode the Brady junk

[00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:04.100]
The Brady junk

[00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:06.020]
Tom Brady's fun

[00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:11.820]
They got paid and all knocked out by Brady's fun

[00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:16.540]
He's got the power of that Tommy boy

[00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:18.840]
It's 1031 at 560 WQA

[00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:21.160]
We have 864 votes on our current poll

[00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:21.960]
You know what I'm gonna do?

[00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:23.000]
I tell you what I'm gonna do

[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:23.480]
Tell me

[00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:25.440]
I'm sure that's what Jimmy Durrandy used to say

[00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:27.560]
I'm gonna do what I'm gonna do

[00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:29.140]
I think I was him maybe not

[00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:29.720]
Probably not

[00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:32.180]
But then again, that's 100 years ago

[00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:34.440]
And who else would remember that?

[00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:35.920]
Maybe he'll send you a message and say it

[00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:36.680]
I was Jimmy Durrandy

[00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:37.600]
Incending could do

[00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:40.160]
Was he a town or what?

[00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:40.440]
No

[00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:42.120]
Right place?

[00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:42.740]
Right time

[00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:43.320]
Now he's dead

[00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:45.060]
864 votes

[00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:47.080]
And what I'm gonna do is when we get to 1000

[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:47.900]
I'm gonna change the poll

[00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:49.400]
Because thanks to Fat Eric who's rea

[00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:51.280]
Eric's been doing a stellar job lately

[00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:51.980]
Thank you Eric

[00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:54.200]
I appreciate you and I appreciate you

[00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:56.680]
Even though I've George and Chris don't

[00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:59.620]
I can't say it anymore but I appreciate him

[00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:01.180]
Qtus babyface fat man I know

[00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:03.720]
What about Eric?

[00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:06.000]
There's another one while we're trying to save Chris's life over here

[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:07.480]
Why is he still fat Eric?

[00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:09.100]
Eric I don't know, even I should think about him

[00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:09.800]
You know how that goes?

[00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:11.340]
1 way 500 pounds

[00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:13.560]
He doesn't way no 5

[00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:15.400]
He's got an ounce over 480

[00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:16.760]
Now what do you think the Humper's

[00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:19.520]
Were you in that on that meat scale?

[00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:21.880]
868 votes

[00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:23.520]
When I get to 1000 I'm gonna change the poll

[00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:24.660]
And you won't even have to worry about it

[00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:26.940]
Because what I started to say is Eric's already got the new one up there

[00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:28.740]
And I like the new one very very very much

[00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:29.840]
The current one here

[00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:31.580]
Which I'm just getting to finally right now

[00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:33.320]
It's not so good

[00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:34.740]
You probably like it

[00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:36.440]
I like it

[00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:39.200]
Maybe I do

[00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:41.220]
Maybe I do

[00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:41.520]
Maybe I do

[00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:45.020]
Be honest are you an online music pirate that's the whole question

[00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:47.380]
Charlie B sent us a new bunch of polls today

[00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:50.680]
I already threw two of my out of the three I smit canned to him

[00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:53.680]
Charlie you're really falling off the wagon on these polls

[00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:56.260]
Man and we don't appreciate your very fine efforts

[00:23:56.800 --> 00:24:00.400]
But it's important we don't want to have to do stuff that sounds a little bit too much like work

[00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:02.860]
Especially with my summer schedule kind of very soon

[00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:04.340]
Oh

[00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:11.540]
868 be honest are you an online music pirate never was 414 never was that was me I voted for that

[00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:17.760]
Yes, but who was in 131 not anymore 115 probably a lot of people got scared

[00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:21.560]
They used to but now they're a scared because they're right about all their friends getting you know

[00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:24.620]
Find and going off being let off and shackles and stuff

[00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:27.920]
What is a switch is a switch like a thing from a bush?

[00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:31.680]
It's a it's a thin flexible brand from a bush

[00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:41.140]
Yeah, oh I saw a nasty thing from a bush that my space page yesterday. Oh scary. Yeah. Oh let me don't let me forget about the queen and George W

[00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:45.760]
Yeah, she is such an uptight nasty rotten bitch. Oh, yeah

[00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:50.580]
Even even when I'm like sympathizing with him which is almost impossible for me but I'm thinking you know

[00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:56.100]
At least he came up with a clever line and a little bit of a comeback and tried to cover up his usual gaff will get to that

[00:24:56.740 --> 00:25:02.400]
Not anymore 115 on steel mose music pirate I always painted out loud music 62

[00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:06.960]
Yes, but I see it as getting back at the greedy recording industry and it's artists 59

[00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:10.160]
Well, what kind of a rationalization is that you know

[00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:12.280]
There's nothing worse than people who do

[00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:16.400]
Glotest things and then they rationalize their aberrant behavior

[00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:20.140]
But I don't care if it does threaten the future of the music industry 55

[00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:24.400]
Well, at least they're being honest right they're just thieves that's all and they don't give a crap

[00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:29.840]
Yes, but I feel certainly guilty doing it 25 and this one which I don't even really understand it

[00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:36.800]
Come on now. I prefer to steal music with five finger discount way. Hey in other words just stealing it looks stealing the CD

[00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:41.840]
Right, but this count way that five finger discount means shoplifting you know

[00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:46.400]
Five finger discount means shoplifting. Yeah, five fingers on a hand

[00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:53.800]
Well, we'll diagram it for you on it. I'll draw you a picture. Oh, man

[00:25:53.800 --> 00:26:00.340]
Put my hand on a piece of paper and trace you out on something every day on the show this Chris man he is about as informative as it gets

[00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:05.500]
How to help him we avoid a 45-year-old guy like Chris to inform me five fingers on a hand

[00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:08.800]
We're talking about how you've been around for 60 years and never heard of five fingers

[00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:10.360]
Because of the old and days they didn't have that

[00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:15.700]
I never heard that before five finger discount when you're old you don't stay up to date on the current slang

[00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:21.100]
Yeah, and you're yeah the old farts don't stay up to then that's right. He's still saying hubba hubba hubba

[00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:25.920]
That's right. Oh, okay, and that's the schiziest dead. Yo and once they're well, we'll say

[00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:27.520]
I'm a lot of that too

[00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:33.620]
875 votes. I'm not considered to be a very marginal post so let's get up to a thousand and we can get it out of there

[00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:35.700]
Look at this phone so far today boy

[00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:41.700]
It's pretty quiet yesterday was really quiet. I think you know what's happening now. I think it's the post post mortem

[00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:47.840]
Yeah, no seriously because of paysock and pant and what's the other one and Easter are gone

[00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:52.920]
And I think people now now it's going to be 120 degrees in the shade people are winning down to start to pay lock

[00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:54.620]
Cool last night. It was all cold

[00:26:55.800 --> 00:27:01.440]
Let me see again today. This is the time of the year. Oh, it's beautiful here, Mon. It is so beautiful the sunny shiny

[00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:05.080]
We're getting those nice spring days. You don't mean the early part of the spring?

[00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:10.440]
Words like in the let's see it's already 66 gonna be 77

[00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:15.440]
Today and you know what 77 makes me think of don't you?

[00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:20.720]
Right, so I think of 77 but nevertheless

[00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:27.320]
Just beauty, beautyous and sunshiney a great day for wood buying by the way wood buying Tuesday. You have a gambling problem

[00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:31.920]
No, I don't but you go ahead and think whatever you want to think here's our always great call on line nine.

[00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:37.120]
Q a m W T Q a m. Hello. Good morning. Yes, sir

[00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:41.760]
Yes, I

[00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:47.260]
I'm 62 years old and we have five fingers discount when I was a kid's Michigan. I never heard of it

[00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:52.360]
Never heard of it. No, well, that's probably because you didn't ever take advantage of the discount. That's true

[00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:56.640]
I never know I'll take that back when I was in college I shop lifted I did

[00:27:56.640 --> 00:28:01.260]
There is a little largely in everybody at some point. That's correct at least in my last number of minutes

[00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:06.460]
That was great thing. Okay, and you two I'm just honest nothing but I know I told you this through many times before we had

[00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:14.340]
These big rotsie our OTC reserve officer training can think was mandatory in college. Yep, and so they had these big rotsie coats

[00:28:14.340 --> 00:28:19.320]
We were in the winter time you go into the cutting-ham drugs and you'd steal in ain things like

[00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:21.100]
Sun tan lotion like in the middle of December

[00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:22.440]
Well, first of all in East Lansing

[00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:25.840]
Wonder how we're gonna use sun tan lotion in the first place, but in the middle of the winter time

[00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:30.940]
But it was just I don't know is this easy to slide off the shelf and in the big pockets you had in your rotsie coat

[00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:35.120]
I don't know why this because we could sure you know why does a dog wicked

[00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:41.660]
So private because it can and the same thing here why do we shoplift craft that we didn't need because we could right I did

[00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:48.140]
Is a child but only essential materials and up until I got a job such as what like food like pens and food food in the school supplies that

[00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:51.420]
Oh school supplies is really Benson would say and one-on-one school

[00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:58.040]
Subtlins and pens and things like that school supplies like a Robbie Benson like a 10-year-old child

[00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:04.840]
You have to be 50 and you still talk about a 10-year-old child they ask the next time you see him he's stealing school supplies

[00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:09.960]
892 votes we're gonna get to a thousand lickety split if I can say that makes me think of that photo

[00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:15.040]
We're gonna also speak into your president and the queen and I guarantee there's more than not just Carl Rove

[00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:16.920]
But there's more than one queen in that White House

[00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:22.180]
So yesterday and I'm sure most of you have seen this George hadn't even seen it now Chris I've had his seen it

[00:29:22.180 --> 00:29:28.080]
They showed that clip of him I'm making the gaff about her being the great friend of the America about the bond

[00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:35.980]
Helping celebrate the by the bicentennial in 1776 I mean 1976 you saw that didn't you? No actually no

[00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:42.840]
Why I saw it off for us I said enough to compensate for both you guys because they showed it at least 50 million times and he said 17

[00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:47.960]
And then he did catch himself 1976 and she had like a little like a few said before the show George

[00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:54.860]
She curled her lip a little bit. Yeah, that's my that's her rye humor. She curled her upper lip a little bit don't touch the queen

[00:29:54.860 --> 00:30:00.500]
Remember what I said before the show about the deal. Yeah, yeah, sit on the air at any rate

[00:30:02.460 --> 00:30:06.000]
At any rate so your president finally came up with a pretty decent line

[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:13.940]
He says she gave me a look that only a mother would give a child and she because after after he stopped and he looked at her after he knew he had made that gaff

[00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:20.720]
He said 1976 needs to pause and he looks at her and say go ahead go ahead in her constipated voice

[00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:25.000]
You bitch out there still bowing down to the queen. It's the wrong queen you're bowing down to

[00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:28.520]
That's the only queen you ought to be bowing down to for Christ sake

[00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:30.740]
Make sure in curtsy when you do it

[00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:36.380]
God is she a nasty evil constipated bitch and we got a whole nation of people

[00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:41.760]
And to think that this country that may as a sin in right now we got her picture on the currency on the $20 bill that bitch

[00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:45.260]
Embarrassed

[00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:46.260]
Humiliating exa-

[00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:52.280]
For majesty her majesty the queen and you wonder why the world is screwed up

[00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:17.800]
For a day with quick place upon their head

[00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:22.940]
Spoons by long lanes and a slutty dress

[00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:27.700]
Rooed on their cheeks and body spray

[00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:30.560]
Now they're ready to play

[00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:32.980]
Wein for a day

[00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:38.000]
Sumbling out in five in pumps

[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:43.480]
You go hobbling about the floods

[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:50.580]
In the home of getting laid so they can feel

[00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:52.940]
You're fairing like a queen for a day

[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:57.900]
Meeting friends at the cabaret

[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:00.660]
For the duty garland

[00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:03.160]
Have a day

[00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:05.540]
This bed like this

[00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:08.080]
So fair and thin

[00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:11.060]
Holding on the stage

[00:32:11.060 --> 00:32:13.260]
Wein for a day

[00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:16.140]
And counter-died

[00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:18.300]
A trunks horse man

[00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:20.960]
Who says hey baby

[00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:23.980]
I want to be your man

[00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:25.880]
That's a fault

[00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:28.300]
But he won't complain

[00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:30.940]
It's a day till play

[00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:33.380]
With a queen for a day

[00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:39.320]
1046-14 before 11

[00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:39.880]
Let's take a look

[00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:41.640]
Before we just ridiculous facts here

[00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:43.060]
That you just passed along to me

[00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:45.560]
I always wondered who this chronic ray guy is

[00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:47.220]
This is university dodge again

[00:32:47.220 --> 00:32:49.000]
It's where Kimba works

[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.780]
So it's some old jump

[00:32:50.780 --> 00:32:51.680]
Maybe it's down there

[00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:52.560]
What is it?

[00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:53.100]
Maybe it's Kim

[00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:53.820]
No

[00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:56.400]
Why would he put the name ray on there?

[00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:56.920]
I'm kidding

[00:32:57.860 --> 00:32:58.700]
You're Kimming

[00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:00.520]
Now what was I just going to say before that

[00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:01.400]
Something very important

[00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:04.200]
And you were talking about what a goofball the facts are is

[00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:05.600]
I'm very important

[00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:07.580]
You were talking about what a goofball the facts are is

[00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:09.260]
No I wasn't talking about that

[00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:10.820]
It was something about the freaking queen

[00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:11.520]
I don't know

[00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:15.260]
God it was probably the most important thing I ever said

[00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:16.240]
Oh here's the schedule

[00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:19.060]
What could be more important than that on wood buying Tuesday

[00:33:19.060 --> 00:33:20.320]
The Thursday schedule

[00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:21.680]
Mad Dog at two

[00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:22.200]
Yeah that's right

[00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:23.760]
The Thursday schedule we like a lot better

[00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:25.640]
Let's pretend today is Thursday May 10th

[00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:25.960]
What do you say?

[00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:26.040]
Yeah

[00:33:26.620 --> 00:33:27.000]
Alright

[00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:29.760]
Mad Dog at two

[00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:30.260]
Four o'clock

[00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:31.860]
You have the power hour with Mad Dog and Hank

[00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:33.020]
I thought that up by the way

[00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:33.940]
And I'm really sorry I did

[00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:35.800]
Humber between five and six thirty

[00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:37.180]
We're going to be testing on the year today

[00:33:37.180 --> 00:33:38.220]
About five thirty

[00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:39.720]
You see if Hank is clinically alive

[00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:42.120]
And not for my sister Badgeo

[00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:44.040]
Six thirty Marlins on deck and then seven

[00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:45.580]
Oh five the Marlins and the Dodgers

[00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:47.560]
Followed by game night with 80 decay

[00:33:48.580 --> 00:33:49.340]
On QAM

[00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:50.860]
Okay now this

[00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:51.940]
Facts ray

[00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:54.060]
Says you keep questioning who said

[00:33:54.060 --> 00:33:55.260]
I'll tell you what I'm going to do

[00:33:55.260 --> 00:33:57.060]
You may be thinking of someone else

[00:33:57.060 --> 00:33:59.020]
Yes I am but one who always said that was

[00:33:59.020 --> 00:34:00.280]
Mottie Hall during Let's Make a Deal

[00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:02.140]
I know that good Canadian Jewish boy

[00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:03.480]
Very very very wealthy

[00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:04.980]
Because a lot of ton of my to charity

[00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:06.040]
Great guy Mottie Hall

[00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:07.220]
But that's not who I'm thinking of

[00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:10.240]
Because somebody said that way way before Mottie Hall

[00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:11.280]
Or Let's Make a Deal

[00:34:12.460 --> 00:34:13.760]
Somebody like Jimmy Duranty

[00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:14.700]
I'm going to do

[00:34:14.700 --> 00:34:15.760]
I don't know if it was him

[00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:18.200]
Did the chicken I ever respond to that or not

[00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:18.660]
Or is he not

[00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:20.160]
What do you mean not

[00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:21.060]
He did not

[00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:21.940]
Well why not

[00:34:21.940 --> 00:34:22.640]
He's not online

[00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:23.820]
I don't know what happened to him

[00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:24.740]
What am he's not online

[00:34:24.740 --> 00:34:25.800]
Is he there in the latter?

[00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:26.160]
Is that your show?

[00:34:26.660 --> 00:34:26.860]
Yeah

[00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:28.280]
He's a horrible man

[00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:29.960]
Until this day I never knew that

[00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:30.400]
Of course you did

[00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:31.900]
I keep telling you Bokeh Brian says this

[00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:32.760]
Bokeh Brian says that

[00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:34.760]
And usually in response to some old time statement

[00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:35.300]
That you make

[00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:35.860]
Really?

[00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:37.080]
Why never do he do it online?

[00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:38.080]
Yes

[00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:38.900]
Well

[00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:40.800]
You think I'm on the phone with him over here during the show?

[00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:42.000]
I had an other wineo

[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:43.500]
Maybe he sent you a message in a bottle

[00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:44.320]
I have no idea

[00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:45.360]
He's sitting on my lap

[00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:46.520]
He's in a party and Proci is still dead by way

[00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:47.480]
Well maybe he's in your lap

[00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:48.440]
Like you're Jerry Mahoney

[00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:49.100]
And Paul Winchell

[00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:50.280]
Paul Winchell's dead by way

[00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:50.940]
Paul Winchell

[00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:53.380]
An energy drink called cocaine

[00:34:53.380 --> 00:34:55.060]
Has been pulled from stores nation

[00:34:55.060 --> 00:34:56.520]
Widermost concerns about its name

[00:34:56.520 --> 00:34:59.060]
The company that produces its said yesterday

[00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:00.600]
Clegg Ivy

[00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:02.300]
A partner in Redox beverages

[00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:04.880]
LLC of Las Vegas said the company plans to sell the drink

[00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:06.280]
Under a new name for now

[00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:07.300]
They got to change the name

[00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:10.020]
The FDA issued a warning letter last month

[00:35:10.020 --> 00:35:12.140]
That said Redox was illegally marketing the drink

[00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:13.420]
As a street drug alternative

[00:35:13.420 --> 00:35:14.760]
And a dietary supplement

[00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:16.840]
May 4th was the deadline for the company to respond

[00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:19.480]
Which sounds like last what?

[00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:20.680]
Friday

[00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:24.420]
The FDA said it is evidence that drinks labeling and website

[00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:26.600]
Which included these statements speeden a can

[00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:29.920]
Liquid cocaine and cocaine instant rush

[00:35:30.860 --> 00:35:33.080]
The company says cocaine contains no drugs

[00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:34.560]
And is marketed as an energy drink

[00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:37.100]
It's been sold since last August and released in dozen states

[00:35:37.660 --> 00:35:39.780]
Of course we intended for cocaine energy drink

[00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:40.920]
To be a legal alternative

[00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:44.460]
The same way that celibacy is an alternative to premarital sex ivy said

[00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:45.960]
Oh give me a break

[00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:47.660]
Oh brother

[00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:50.040]
It's not the same thing and no one thinks it is

[00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:51.900]
Our product doesn't have any cocaine in it

[00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:53.180]
No one thinks that it does

[00:35:53.180 --> 00:35:56.320]
And I think everybody thinks that celibacy is the same thing as premarital sex

[00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:56.960]
Right

[00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:59.880]
We think it is mostly illegal in the US to ship our product

[00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:00.500]
He says

[00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:02.440]
But that's why they're changing their name

[00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:05.700]
Ivy said the FDA did not order the company to stop marketing the drink

[00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:07.880]
But officials were concerned about possible legal action

[00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:11.080]
They'll announce a new name within a week and hope to have the product back on store shelves

[00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:12.120]
Within a few weeks

[00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:14.280]
What we would like to do is continue

[00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:15.440]
Tell me what I'm going to do

[00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:21.060]
What we'd like to do is continue to find to keep the name because it's clearly the name that's the problem ivy said

[00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:26.940]
What we can't do is distribute our product when regulators in the states in the FDA are saying that if you do this you can go to jail

[00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:31.320]
Attorney is general, attorney is general

[00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:35.180]
In Connecticut in the North, recently announced that red arcs had agreed to stop marketing cocaine in those states

[00:36:35.180 --> 00:36:37.580]
While a judge in Texas is called a distribution there

[00:36:38.900 --> 00:36:42.900]
Our goal is to literally flush cocaine down the drain across the nations

[00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:46.820]
A Connecticut attorney general Richard Blumenthal sounds extremely Jewish to me

[00:36:46.820 --> 00:36:49.040]
Who announced the company's agreement with the state on Monday

[00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:53.960]
Our main complaint about cocaine is its name and marketing strategy seeking to glorify legal drug use

[00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:58.920]
And exploit the allure of marketing speed in a can as it's called the product

[00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:01.320]
Speed in a can speed in your can

[00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:03.040]
Or something like that

[00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:08.020]
917, well I said now it's the 1051, I bet you by 1130 we got our thousand votes

[00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:10.140]
And then we can change the poll and put something good on there

[00:37:10.660 --> 00:37:13.480]
Although won't that be bad because I'm going to have to start reading the result of the...

[00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:14.800]
See that's not a good idea is it?

[00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:15.560]
Yeah

[00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:20.920]
But then again if we start it early then we can have like 1800 votes on the poll for tomorrow

[00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:26.720]
Won't that be a... and of course since tomorrow is not wood buying Wednesday and it's a regular four hour show like today

[00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:28.500]
I'm not too happy about that by the way

[00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:31.720]
Too complete four hour shows in a row and it's not going to allow you to feel

[00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:35.060]
As a result of that Thursday we're leaving at 1130 come hell or high water

[00:37:35.060 --> 00:37:36.860]
Now what's the weather going to be on Thursday?

[00:37:36.860 --> 00:37:40.080]
I better during the break look up make sure we're not going to have no rain out or something like that

[00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:41.500]
That would be really bad

[00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:43.820]
That's why we need a covered what you call it

[00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:45.640]
We need a domed stage in maybe

[00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:46.520]
We need a domed stand

[00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:50.600]
We need the taxpayers to give five hundred million dollars to Jeffrey Laurie and David Sampson

[00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:52.020]
So they can go out and build a palace

[00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:55.120]
Nobody will show up there because nobody really cares about the marlins or about baseball

[00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:57.620]
Or about any sport except football but nonetheless

[00:37:58.340 --> 00:38:00.660]
And about the basketball when they win the championship

[00:38:00.660 --> 00:38:01.900]
Other than that

[00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:04.540]
Talk about a phony market

[00:38:04.540 --> 00:38:06.740]
Well I got two stories about the Democrats

[00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:11.920]
Senator Hillary Clinton has increased to a lead over the Democrat feel of the race for the presidential nomination

[00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:16.060]
According to a new CNN opinion research corporation pull released yesterday afternoon

[00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:18.140]
That's bad news that ice princess

[00:38:18.140 --> 00:38:23.400]
In the past month Clinton supported among Democrats rose to 38% from 30%

[00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:24.300]
About 30 men

[00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:27.940]
Well support from Barack Obama of Illinois dropped by two points to 24%

[00:38:27.940 --> 00:38:32.420]
Yeah, it's kind of silly because it's the middle not even the middle of May yet of 2007

[00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:35.820]
Half of at least half the country doesn't even know who Barack Obama is yet

[00:38:35.820 --> 00:38:39.580]
And once they start getting serious and talking issues and they start debating

[00:38:39.580 --> 00:38:43.120]
He's gonna, you know, I'm not talking about that phony debate they had a couple weeks ago

[00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:46.000]
He's gonna ring run rings around her ass

[00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:48.700]
She's probably already got rings around her ass

[00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:52.240]
In fact, if you look at that picture of Laura Bush, we got on that page there

[00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:56.520]
Well former vice president Al Gore continues to draw strong support even though he's not running

[00:38:56.520 --> 00:38:59.740]
Gore and former senator John Edwards each received 12%.

[00:39:00.420 --> 00:39:03.300]
Democrats have been prepared to be very happy with their field of candidates

[00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:05.580]
With 38% declaring themselves very satisfied

[00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:07.600]
46% fairly satisfied

[00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:11.800]
10% not very satisfied and 4% not satisfied at all

[00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:13.840]
3% just said like that

[00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:14.740]
Garnish nothing

[00:39:15.380 --> 00:39:18.040]
So here's the full results of this poll now whose poll is it?

[00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:20.140]
CNN opinion research yesterday afternoon

[00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:24.100]
She's got the swillery's got 38, Obama 24, Gore 12, Edwards 12

[00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:25.020]
Richardson

[00:39:25.980 --> 00:39:28.780]
Good guy from New Mexico, 5% nobody knows who he is

[00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:32.100]
Joe Biden 2% Chris Dodd a Connecticut great guy

[00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:34.760]
He's only got 2% no chance and poor little Dennis Kitson

[00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:36.780]
And she's a little guy he's got that bad hair piece

[00:39:36.780 --> 00:39:39.540]
He's got 1% and Grvell's got the asterisk

[00:39:40.060 --> 00:39:42.360]
Kind like we have 11 a midnight a QAM on that

[00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:43.940]
Oh, oh, oh

[00:39:44.420 --> 00:39:47.520]
I don't want to dwell on those ratings again because then that same jackass or

[00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:49.440]
Are you talking about the ratings again?

[00:39:49.580 --> 00:39:49.980]
Yeah

[00:39:49.980 --> 00:39:52.700]
See even when they're bad we talk about them on this show

[00:39:52.700 --> 00:39:54.900]
We don't make them up, we don't lie about them

[00:39:54.900 --> 00:39:56.260]
We don't try to find some statistic

[00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:58.680]
That's called finding a story in the business

[00:39:59.340 --> 00:40:03.420]
Stations that have no numbers they always find as a like if they had a 0.1 in the

[00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:05.500]
Previous book and they had a 0.2 in this book

[00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:08.920]
We double their audience in the winter like yeah

[00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:12.260]
Well, Pacquiao Salami sandwich really proud of you

[00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:15.340]
This illusion support is a present of worship by the way

[00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:16.820]
Are defecting to guess whom?

[00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:17.820]
Barack Obama

[00:40:19.820 --> 00:40:23.140]
As the candidate with the best chance for you nighting a divided nation

[00:40:23.140 --> 00:40:24.500]
They happen to be absolutely correct

[00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:26.800]
Here's a guy what's this guy's name?

[00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:29.100]
Didn't print out anyway, didn't make any difference who he is

[00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:31.480]
He's switching for his support to Obama

[00:40:33.140 --> 00:40:35.660]
Remember the Republican National Committee one of many former Bush and

[00:40:35.660 --> 00:40:39.020]
Myers who found the Democrat newcomer appealing Matthew Dowd Bush achieved

[00:40:39.020 --> 00:40:42.420]
Campaign strategies in 2004 announced last month he was disillusioned with the

[00:40:42.420 --> 00:40:45.260]
War in Iraq and the president's my way of the highway style leadership

[00:40:45.700 --> 00:40:49.340]
Although Dowd has yet to endorse a candidate he said the only one he liked so far was Obama

[00:40:49.340 --> 00:40:53.860]
I think we should design campaigns that appeal not to 51 percent of the people

[00:40:53.860 --> 00:40:56.920]
Dowd said bring them a country together as a whole that's what they W

[00:40:56.920 --> 00:40:59.180]
Whole not the W we got now

[00:41:01.140 --> 00:41:04.220]
From 1776 maybe she was just pissed off standing there being next to him

[00:41:04.220 --> 00:41:08.880]
Is why she didn't crack the smile the queen go on go ahead would you you dumb old you bowzo

[00:41:09.460 --> 00:41:12.600]
Bernstein is a champion of human rights who admire so bad was called for action on

[00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:16.180]
Darfur while Dowd's opposition to the war has been sharpened by the expected

[00:41:16.180 --> 00:41:19.740]
Deployment to rack of his son and Arabic speaking army intelligence specialist

[00:41:19.740 --> 00:41:23.180]
But last week is a surprising new name during the course of praise for the anti-World

[00:41:23.180 --> 00:41:27.720]
Obama that of Robert Kagan a leading Neocon and co-founder of the project for the

[00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:31.540]
New American century in the late 1990s which called for the overthrow of son of

[00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:35.580]
Hussein Oye Kagan's informal for foreign policy advisor the Republican senator

[00:41:35.580 --> 00:41:39.560]
John McCain remains the favored Neocon choice for the White House but an article in the

[00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:43.600]
Washington Post Kagan wrote approving the the keynote speech by Obama at the Chicago

[00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:48.180]
Council on global affairs was pure John Kennedy a Neocon hero of the Cold War

[00:41:48.180 --> 00:41:54.340]
How do you like that personally I liked it Kagan wrote after somebody asked him

[00:41:54.340 --> 00:41:59.140]
And he said yeah he liked it how do you like that you'll see as the months go on

[00:41:59.140 --> 00:42:02.740]
All this to Hillary talk they're going to realize what a cold miserable lying bitch she is

[00:42:02.740 --> 00:42:07.400]
And all that war stuff you know she hasn't got a clue for last name was Jones

[00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:12.080]
She wouldn't have a Chinman's chance in purgatory I say that right now Hillary Jones

[00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:13.840]
For kids

[00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:15.980]
For kids

[00:42:15.980 --> 00:42:17.340]
For kids

[00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:21.220]
933 votes on the pool next hour going over a thousand we're going to switch it I don't

[00:42:21.220 --> 00:42:25.620]
Feel what you say that gives us a chance tomorrow to have a tumultuous Wednesday

[00:42:25.620 --> 00:42:26.060]
Oh

[00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:29.400]
Can you feel the earth shake from the must be

[00:42:32.620 --> 00:42:36.480]
Maybe the thumb is in the building Adam you've got work hard to keep him alive

[00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:39.140]
Because based on Joe's facts which I won't read on the year was very cool

[00:42:40.020 --> 00:42:45.020]
But I think he thought it's concerned he was he was concerned but it was cool comments

[00:42:45.020 --> 00:42:52.760]
You know about bigger than a freight train and bigger than a house and sugar rushes and hide blood sugar and things like that

[00:42:53.620 --> 00:42:56.860]
You better do something about putting Chris write it down on the calendar

[00:42:57.420 --> 00:43:00.020]
May the eighth I'm putting George and charger keeping Hank alive

[00:43:00.020 --> 00:43:01.260]
All right

[00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:04.480]
This is the Neal Roger show

[00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:07.180]
this is the brain

[00:43:07.180 --> 00:43:10.120]
go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go any questions

[00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:17.820]
Soda and shampoo and coffee and water

[00:43:17.820 --> 00:43:21.400]
Gel candles and TV rings for your daughter

[00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:24.940]
Jump out that two-dig free case of champagne

[00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:28.980]
These are the things you can't take on a plane

[00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:34.560]
And she's with us, hair gel and lip balm and toothpaste.

[00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:38.540]
Oh, clear a seal for all of those that's on your face.

[00:43:38.900 --> 00:43:41.740]
You have that sunburn but now so looking.

[00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:46.100]
That's one more thing you can take on a place.

[00:43:46.740 --> 00:43:52.940]
And the airport you'll be waiting if they see the same.

[00:43:53.620 --> 00:43:56.880]
And while they make you throw out all of those things,

[00:43:57.620 --> 00:44:02.480]
you cannot take on a plane.

[00:44:03.700 --> 00:44:07.480]
If you're going to gate four, you'll find several homosexuals on the plane.

[00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:09.080]
And the Lord says it's a sin.

[00:44:10.580 --> 00:44:12.120]
So that guy got canned by the way.

[00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:13.240]
Shufrao, I mean, Jesse.

[00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:13.480]

[00:44:13.700 --> 00:44:14.680]
What I was trying to pay you this.

[00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:15.860]
Look at this.

[00:44:15.980 --> 00:44:18.580]
In the article today, they spelled his name different than the way they did yesterday.

[00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:19.660]
I think that was a title.

[00:44:20.180 --> 00:44:20.440]
Jeff Rose.

[00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:20.880]
I don't know.

[00:44:21.820 --> 00:44:22.980]
Maybe he was just too embarrassing.

[00:44:23.180 --> 00:44:23.980]
Maybe he changed it.

[00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:33.000]
An apologetic self-described prankster was fired yesterday after official said they found out he used an airport speaker system to play a Bible verse that offended a gay couple.

[00:44:33.580 --> 00:44:38.800]
Are you allowed obnoxious screaming queens go to gate one immediately?

[00:44:39.220 --> 00:44:41.980]
Okay. In fact, they probably can fly without the plane is what he was suggesting.

[00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:43.320]
Is that what it says in Leviticus?

[00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:44.780]
That's right.

[00:44:45.060 --> 00:44:45.620]
That's what I thought.

[00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:48.360]
Like I said, it's an industrial monestime.

[00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:52.920]
23 who worked for a superior aircraft services at Fort Lauderdale Hollywood International Airport for about a year.

[00:44:52.920 --> 00:45:00.380]
Admitted he was responsible for applying the controversial message twice in the baguagery of terminal three at about 12.45 am May 1th.

[00:45:01.140 --> 00:45:01.740]
Moan's time.

[00:45:02.260 --> 00:45:08.180]
We called using his cell phone to play recording that said, if a man lives with a man is one life with a woman, they should be put to death.

[00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:10.140]
The announcement came from Leviticus 2013.

[00:45:10.180 --> 00:45:12.600]
See, I told you, all the nasty stuff in Leviticus.

[00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:14.040]
He must have been anti-Somantic.

[00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:16.460]
Who knew it was Leviticus, by the way?

[00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:18.080]
Well, what did he know?

[00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:19.540]
I don't know if it was a he, I think it was a he.

[00:45:19.580 --> 00:45:20.660]
I know that's what I'm just saying.

[00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:22.560]
I mean, there was no Genesis and there was no Exodus.

[00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:23.920]
Maybe there was a guy named Exodus.

[00:45:24.380 --> 00:45:24.680]
Exodus.

[00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:27.800]
Anthony would need wiki.

[00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:29.480]
Well, we know about him and his boyfriend.

[00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:30.880]
It was a death ready set.

[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:32.860]
I appreciate the fact that Pulley's followed up on this.

[00:45:34.280 --> 00:45:40.720]
I just wanted to apologize to everybody who was involved, especially the couple of moans time, said that this Hollywood homestead was working for me yesterday afternoon.

[00:45:41.060 --> 00:45:42.360]
I didn't think it was going to hurt anybody.

[00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:43.520]
God.

[00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:48.060]
As Rick Weaver would say, and let's see, do we have that in there or not anymore?

[00:45:48.420 --> 00:45:49.020]
Now, I don't know.

[00:45:49.020 --> 00:45:49.520]
Oh, yeah, we do.

[00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:50.460]
You would dummy.

[00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:52.420]
Yeah, that's what Mr. Weaver would say.

[00:45:53.360 --> 00:45:54.680]
I was shocked and he was worried.

[00:45:55.020 --> 00:45:56.380]
Tertullian said, that's the partner.

[00:45:57.300 --> 00:45:59.980]
Denise Tertullian, and who lives with moans time, said, oh, I see.

[00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:01.720]
Several of us were disappointed in him.

[00:46:02.020 --> 00:46:03.460]
Tertullian said the family was eating dinner.

[00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:06.440]
Some day when four investigators arrived in woke up, moans started to talk to him.

[00:46:07.660 --> 00:46:18.980]
Danny Pine, one of his kind to Joe Pine, co-owner of Superior Aircraft, a proper company with more than 100 employees at the airport, said moans time was fired yesterday in the company issue in apology to need wiki and Hudson, the two boyfriends.

[00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:29.520]
Robert County Mayor Joe C. Fist, Eglton Jr. tell the news conference his data when our officials had found the culprit to claim to say how moans time was identified as the broadcaster.

[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:34.640]
Oh, yeah, I'm surprised they didn't blame it on me or I'm us or somebody with a big potty mouth like that.

[00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:36.640]
I do faggot's here going down.

[00:46:36.920 --> 00:46:37.520]
You know, like that.

[00:46:38.460 --> 00:46:42.600]
Eglton said to Sherasaw, it's okay if I encoder says it because she's the right way not to see bits.

[00:46:42.780 --> 00:46:43.180]
That's okay.

[00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:45.400]
And these are the times in which we live.

[00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:51.180]
Eglton said the Sherasaw officers would turn the case over to the broadcaster, turn his office to determine whether criminal charges ought to be found.

[00:46:51.500 --> 00:46:52.400]
Oh, come on now.

[00:46:52.660 --> 00:46:53.980]
Let's lighten up just a little bit.

[00:46:54.140 --> 00:46:54.240]
Okay.

[00:46:54.500 --> 00:46:55.740]
The criminal charges my ass.

[00:46:56.660 --> 00:46:57.000]
Probably.

[00:46:57.380 --> 00:46:59.640]
Moans time said a friend sent the verse to his cell phone.

[00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:02.220]
And he said he played it over the intercom without considering the consequences.

[00:47:02.220 --> 00:47:04.640]
I didn't know that a gay couple was in the airport at the time.

[00:47:04.900 --> 00:47:07.060]
I mean, wouldn't that be unusual to have a gay couple in the airport?

[00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:08.820]
Wow, especially in Fort Lauderdale.

[00:47:10.520 --> 00:47:14.520]
The airport officials review policies, no, preventing another such incident said Bob B.

[00:47:14.620 --> 00:47:17.060]
Like interim director of the county aviation department.

[00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:19.680]
Things are all secure at Fort Lauderdale Hollywood.

[00:47:20.060 --> 00:47:28.160]
That's why you see little unattended kids running and opening up doors and noises going off and sirens and bells ringing and lights flashing and all about the...

[00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:28.880]
All of these things.

[00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:29.040]
I'm surprised.

[00:47:30.680 --> 00:47:31.480]
948 on the pool.

[00:47:31.740 --> 00:47:33.780]
Chris is really excited to get to that thousand real...

[00:47:33.780 --> 00:47:35.940]
Now, let me ask you, do you like this pool? I think it sucks.

[00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:37.820]
It's okay.

[00:47:38.900 --> 00:47:39.220]
950.

[00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:40.940]
Certainly that one would surely be the better ones.

[00:47:41.220 --> 00:47:42.560]
The next one though is much better.

[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:43.580]
And I'm itching.

[00:47:43.720 --> 00:47:44.780]
I'm just dying to change it.

[00:47:44.840 --> 00:47:46.520]
I'm almost ready to change it now that I won't do it.

[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:48.400]
Did I say we'll wait to get to a thousand?

[00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:49.560]
Yes.

[00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:50.060]
I don't know.

[00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:51.900]
Well, the pool says, be honest.

[00:47:53.080 --> 00:47:54.760]
Are you an online music pirate, be honest.

[00:47:54.920 --> 00:47:55.540]
Don't lie to us.

[00:47:55.540 --> 00:47:58.400]
We're going to trace the IP address of all these votes.

[00:47:58.520 --> 00:48:00.540]
And we're going to come knocking on your door for any afternoon.

[00:48:00.820 --> 00:48:01.820]
And we're bringing that...

[00:48:01.820 --> 00:48:03.960]
Jeff Schufro, a moonstime with us.

[00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:05.960]
And he's going to give you a what for?

[00:48:06.340 --> 00:48:07.860]
He's going to tell you you're all going to burn in hell.

[00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:09.440]
Never was.

[00:48:09.820 --> 00:48:10.620]
Now, let me ask you.

[00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:12.480]
Have you ever thought about this that we are in hell?

[00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:13.600]
Sure.

[00:48:13.860 --> 00:48:14.400]
It's crossman life.

[00:48:14.820 --> 00:48:14.960]
Yeah.

[00:48:15.180 --> 00:48:17.180]
I bet you everybody thinks about that at some time in life.

[00:48:17.320 --> 00:48:19.380]
It's a move itself Florida, that is, if that's what you mean.

[00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:19.940]
Oh, that's true.

[00:48:20.020 --> 00:48:21.100]
I'm not in hell anymore.

[00:48:21.260 --> 00:48:22.280]
It proves you can get out.

[00:48:23.020 --> 00:48:23.680]
When in doubt?

[00:48:23.980 --> 00:48:24.260]
Get out.

[00:48:24.260 --> 00:48:25.220]
Get the hell out.

[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:28.320]
Never was an online music, part 453.

[00:48:28.440 --> 00:48:29.080]
Well, good for us.

[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:31.580]
I still love this stuff, but not music.

[00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:34.280]
Yes, but who is an 145?

[00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:36.440]
Not anymore, 126.

[00:48:36.860 --> 00:48:38.540]
Not since you started tracing the IP addresses.

[00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:41.340]
I always painted out on music 67.

[00:48:41.820 --> 00:48:44.820]
Yes, but I see this getting back to the greenie recording industry in art at 65.

[00:48:45.460 --> 00:48:48.120]
That's how we're going into Walmart and shoplifting about this stuff.

[00:48:48.340 --> 00:48:50.740]
I'm just getting back to these greenie Walmart people, you know?

[00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:52.660]
Am I right?

[00:48:52.660 --> 00:48:52.740]
Right.

[00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:56.720]
It's just rationalizing your own illegal unacceptable behavior.

[00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:58.120]
You can't steal a bunch of crap.

[00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:01.080]
At least if you're going to steal, steal some good music.

[00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:02.280]
Right.

[00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:03.520]
If they ever make anymore.

[00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:06.380]
Yes, and I don't care if it does threaten the future of the music industry.

[00:49:06.780 --> 00:49:09.120]
55 people who are very greedy but very honest.

[00:49:09.320 --> 00:49:09.920]
They don't give a crap.

[00:49:10.620 --> 00:49:14.480]
Yes, but I feel sort of guilty doing a 31, sort of kind of a little bit.

[00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:19.140]
And I prefer to steal music to five fingered, this is not way eight.

[00:49:19.420 --> 00:49:20.400]
I don't care what you say.

[00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:21.760]
I never heard of that before in my life.

[00:49:21.760 --> 00:49:25.520]
And the guy that called me 462 almost as ancient as I am.

[00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:26.860]
So it's not an age thing.

[00:49:27.220 --> 00:49:29.260]
I just, you know, I just never crossed my life.

[00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:29.780]
That's all.

[00:49:29.940 --> 00:49:31.260]
Obviously you didn't run with that crowd.

[00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:33.420]
Did I run with a shoplifting crowd?

[00:49:33.580 --> 00:49:34.000]
That's for sure.

[00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:35.060]
I ran with a gay crowd.

[00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:36.140]
That's correct.

[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:39.940]
They may have been putting their hands in a few pockets but they had something else in mind.

[00:49:40.020 --> 00:49:41.100]
They were lifting something in time.

[00:49:41.180 --> 00:49:44.220]
They were lifting it but, you know, they left it there afterward.

[00:49:45.220 --> 00:49:45.880]
I would hope.

[00:49:46.700 --> 00:49:49.480]
9.50, 6.9, a.m.

[00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:49.720]
I'm going to pull.

[00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:52.000]
44 more votes and we can get off of that thing.

[00:49:52.100 --> 00:49:53.120]
It really sucks, Charlie.

[00:49:53.360 --> 00:49:53.460]
Sorry.

[00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:54.560]
Sorry, Charlie.

[00:49:55.500 --> 00:49:56.260]
WQA M, hello.

[00:49:56.680 --> 00:49:58.180]
Hello, gentle caller.

[00:49:58.620 --> 00:49:59.260]
How are you?

[00:49:59.740 --> 00:50:00.360]
Gentle caller.

[00:50:00.700 --> 00:50:01.220]
Hello, you.

[00:50:01.380 --> 00:50:03.200]
You're calling up.

[00:50:04.280 --> 00:50:04.680]
People?

[00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:06.340]
No, I'm not calling up.

[00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:06.680]
Oh.

[00:50:07.180 --> 00:50:07.980]
Did you call us?

[00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:10.080]
Let me check.

[00:50:10.520 --> 00:50:11.680]
Yeah, what can we do for you, sir?

[00:50:12.020 --> 00:50:12.420]
Oh, okay.

[00:50:12.500 --> 00:50:14.060]
I guess the pills didn't arrive today.

[00:50:15.220 --> 00:50:15.560]
Wow.

[00:50:15.560 --> 00:50:20.300]
5.670560, pound 560 under the rise in the singular wireless tie.

[00:50:20.460 --> 00:50:24.560]
We got 5,000 people left inside the food for the rest of the summertime and I guess they're

[00:50:24.560 --> 00:50:25.640]
kind of bored, which is good.

[00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:26.940]
At least it'll give them something to do.

[00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:30.320]
Because starting in the middle of June it'll be a lot of George, baby.

[00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:31.060]
A lot of George.

[00:50:31.180 --> 00:50:31.620]
No tapes.

[00:50:32.820 --> 00:50:33.300]
No tapes.

[00:50:35.300 --> 00:50:36.020]
Damn it.

[00:50:36.020 --> 00:50:38.640]
I'm sure Charlie Joe is working feverishly on a way to go.

[00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:39.240]
I'm sure.

[00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:39.840]
Interject that.

[00:50:40.600 --> 00:50:41.320]
WQA M, hello.

[00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:43.100]
Good morning, Neil, please.

[00:50:43.420 --> 00:50:43.800]
Yes, sir.

[00:50:43.800 --> 00:50:44.160]
We're speaking.

[00:50:44.980 --> 00:50:48.480]
There are no $20 British bills.

[00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:49.980]
They're 20 pounds.

[00:50:50.100 --> 00:50:51.300]
Sir, I said Canadian bills.

[00:50:51.460 --> 00:50:53.240]
I was talking about Canadian bills, not British.

[00:50:53.460 --> 00:50:55.660]
I'm well aware of the currency and Euro, sir.

[00:50:56.200 --> 00:50:57.820]
Oh, so it's not so Canadian?

[00:50:58.200 --> 00:50:58.560]
Canadian?

[00:50:59.100 --> 00:51:00.860]
It's not the bounds.

[00:51:01.220 --> 00:51:02.200]
It's the dollar.

[00:51:02.680 --> 00:51:03.280]
That is correct.

[00:51:03.640 --> 00:51:04.480]
Have a lovely day.

[00:51:04.680 --> 00:51:05.000]
I love you, sir.

[00:51:05.020 --> 00:51:05.420]
You know what?

[00:51:05.460 --> 00:51:06.340]
You're just learning that?

[00:51:06.400 --> 00:51:07.680]
That candidate doesn't have pounds.

[00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:08.320]
They have dollars?

[00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:10.300]
Oh, he's gone.

[00:51:10.540 --> 00:51:11.120]
He's too embarrassed.

[00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:12.440]
What a bozo.

[00:51:13.100 --> 00:51:14.880]
Now, I got pounds, all right.

[00:51:15.300 --> 00:51:17.180]
188 of them on the scale, but those are the only pounds.

[00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:19.300]
In fact, we do have pounds here, not kilos.

[00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:21.600]
That's the thing that I find very bizarre.

[00:51:21.840 --> 00:51:23.260]
I like here, we're on the metric system.

[00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:25.000]
Most of the world is except the USA.

[00:51:25.460 --> 00:51:25.760]
That's right.

[00:51:26.220 --> 00:51:26.680]
But they do.

[00:51:27.060 --> 00:51:28.340]
No, actually, they don't do pounds.

[00:51:30.140 --> 00:51:32.800]
They do kilos, but I've just never seen anything with kilos.

[00:51:33.500 --> 00:51:34.160]
I'll send you something.

[00:51:35.160 --> 00:51:37.860]
For example, the scale I got, it's in pounds, and I bought it here.

[00:51:38.120 --> 00:51:38.920]
So, you know what I'm saying?

[00:51:39.140 --> 00:51:40.680]
At least be consistent for Christ's sake.

[00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:44.640]
Although the US is the only stubborn backstreet that don't do the metric system, the whole rest of the world,

[00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:46.080]
kilo is 2.2 pounds.

[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:47.860]
Even I know that.

[00:51:48.460 --> 00:51:50.160]
And this guy, this guy, I'm a schmuck.

[00:51:50.340 --> 00:51:51.060]
Okay, I'm a moron.

[00:51:51.060 --> 00:51:52.060]
He's called to educate me.

[00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:52.980]
You made a mistake.

[00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:53.880]
You made a mistake.

[00:51:54.100 --> 00:51:55.900]
The British, there's no such thing as a $20 bill.

[00:51:55.900 --> 00:51:56.580]
They have pounds.

[00:51:56.920 --> 00:51:58.220]
Yeah, they got pounds, all right.

[00:51:58.880 --> 00:52:00.820]
Tons and tons of crap is what they got.

[00:52:01.180 --> 00:52:01.480]
Pounds.

[00:52:03.040 --> 00:52:05.020]
In fact, most of the brits ought to be in the pound.

[00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:07.460]
Oh, I take that back because there's a lot of nice dogs in the pound.

[00:52:07.580 --> 00:52:08.100]
I take that back.

[00:52:08.100 --> 00:52:10.560]
Take the dogs out and put the brits in there in the pound.

[00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:17.380]
This is just amazing to me that there's so many parochial stupid people in South Florida.

[00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:23.120]
This guy wouldn't know where to find Canada on the map with both hands of flash light and the search party in a compass.

[00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:26.120]
And six assistants.

[00:52:26.680 --> 00:52:27.760]
Put his hands on jeopardy.

[00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:28.600]
There's a really bad show.

[00:52:29.500 --> 00:52:34.900]
The answer is, well, I tell you, you know, I used to like Alistair Beck when he was on constipation or whatever that show was.

[00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:37.420]
And now I just despise him.

[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:39.440]
He is such a pseudo intellectual.

[00:52:39.660 --> 00:52:41.180]
Of course, you got to be a pseudo beyond the idea.

[00:52:41.560 --> 00:52:41.800]
Yeah, yeah.

[00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:43.760]
He doesn't want to talk about jeopardy.

[00:52:43.880 --> 00:52:44.160]
It sucks.

[00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:46.720]
All right, I was going to take a shout at it, but that's all right.

[00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:47.420]
Go ahead.

[00:52:48.140 --> 00:52:50.780]
He can't because he's Canadian, you know, you know, you canadians.

[00:52:50.780 --> 00:52:51.960]
And I guess he's from one of the friends.

[00:52:51.960 --> 00:52:53.000]
Well, what do you mean you canadians?

[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:53.740]
Zama canadian?

[00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:54.100]
Yeah.

[00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:55.360]
You canucks.

[00:52:55.900 --> 00:52:58.580]
I guess he's from Montreal or wherever the Frenchies are.

[00:52:58.880 --> 00:52:59.100]
Yeah.

[00:52:59.240 --> 00:52:59.660]
Is that it?

[00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:00.380]
I don't know.

[00:53:00.380 --> 00:53:00.700]
Or whatever.

[00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:01.700]
He's Canadian for sure.

[00:53:01.840 --> 00:53:06.460]
Any time that a French word comes up, a French name or a French word, he has to say it in French.

[00:53:06.820 --> 00:53:10.780]
Oh, I see just like the Spanish and New York rules and stuff.

[00:53:11.160 --> 00:53:11.680]
You can I want.

[00:53:11.860 --> 00:53:12.380]
You can I want.

[00:53:12.560 --> 00:53:13.520]
And they break into that all of a sudden.

[00:53:13.680 --> 00:53:13.880]
Yeah.

[00:53:13.940 --> 00:53:14.080]
Yeah.

[00:53:14.200 --> 00:53:14.720]
They're talking about it.

[00:53:14.840 --> 00:53:16.040]
It's like, okay, he's kind of like that.

[00:53:16.200 --> 00:53:18.180]
That's a very impressive piece of quite a metal ball.

[00:53:18.520 --> 00:53:19.140]
Yeah, like that.

[00:53:19.340 --> 00:53:20.780]
But that still doesn't mean that that's a very new idea.

[00:53:20.940 --> 00:53:21.080]
It's not the idea.

[00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:21.200]

[00:53:21.240 --> 00:53:23.580]
Which proves bilingualism doesn't work.

[00:53:25.480 --> 00:53:26.120]
Walk solid.

[00:53:26.120 --> 00:53:30.040]
Be once again the same God bless America and paste these in the G-string up here.

[00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:31.120]
I'll do it.

[00:53:31.180 --> 00:53:32.160]
All right.

[00:53:37.360 --> 00:53:44.060]
Sit in at home, walk in the WWE, if I got hair on my bike and cool as I'm a breath.

[00:53:44.380 --> 00:53:45.640]
I got remote control.

[00:53:46.160 --> 00:53:47.820]
I got my Nintendo joystick.

[00:53:48.420 --> 00:53:49.380]
I'm so damn lazy.

[00:53:49.840 --> 00:53:51.540]
I'm married a pregnant chick.

[00:53:51.540 --> 00:53:54.980]
Well, it's true I drive a beamer and I play lots of golf.

[00:53:55.300 --> 00:53:58.640]
I wear a polyester pants that I never take off.

[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:04.160]
I go out to the bars and I try to be funky, but I don't fool anyone.

[00:54:04.440 --> 00:54:06.080]
It caused me a funky.

[00:54:06.700 --> 00:54:08.100]
Oh, me a funky.

[00:54:08.380 --> 00:54:09.920]
Oh, me a funky.

[00:54:10.320 --> 00:54:11.700]
Oh, me a funky.

[00:54:11.960 --> 00:54:13.100]
It's a little too white.

[00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:15.400]
Oh, me a funky.

[00:54:15.800 --> 00:54:17.220]
Oh, me a funky.

[00:54:17.580 --> 00:54:19.000]
Oh, me a funky.

[00:54:20.500 --> 00:54:26.240]
I listen to Madonna and I think she's really hip in that hoolie-o-as-lacian spell.

[00:54:26.620 --> 00:54:27.740]
It just makes me flip.

[00:54:27.980 --> 00:54:29.620]
I don't like to life cruel.

[00:54:30.140 --> 00:54:31.460]
They're just so darn dirty.

[00:54:31.740 --> 00:54:35.160]
My kids are allowed to listen until they turn 30.

[00:54:35.460 --> 00:54:38.540]
My dad is my uncle and my sister's my aunt.

[00:54:38.800 --> 00:54:42.120]
I'm enrolled in school just to get me a grand.

[00:54:42.360 --> 00:54:44.180]
I tell a lot of ethnic jokes.

[00:54:44.620 --> 00:54:45.700]
I think that they're funny.

[00:54:46.040 --> 00:54:47.580]
I got a bad sense of humor.

[00:54:47.580 --> 00:54:49.580]
It caused me a funky.

[00:54:50.100 --> 00:54:53.480]
Oh, me a funky.

[00:54:53.920 --> 00:54:55.280]
Oh, me a funky.

[00:54:55.500 --> 00:54:56.640]
It's a little too white.

[00:54:57.280 --> 00:54:58.920]
Oh, me a funky.

[00:54:59.340 --> 00:55:00.820]
Oh, me a funky.

[00:55:01.120 --> 00:55:02.560]
Oh, me a funky.

[00:55:02.940 --> 00:55:03.940]
It's a little too white.

[00:55:05.300 --> 00:55:08.500]
Look at me to the barstabble of hey, look at this.

[00:55:08.780 --> 00:55:11.180]
I'm a lot of them to gimm over hair and pull my finger.

[00:55:12.420 --> 00:55:15.940]
1118 at $5.50 WQM, all of trailer trash, all the time.

[00:55:15.940 --> 00:55:17.120]
980 votes for it.

[00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:19.160]
They're really starting to really move big on us.

[00:55:19.260 --> 00:55:20.040]
They want to get rid of this pool.

[00:55:20.160 --> 00:55:20.600]
I don't blame them.

[00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:21.080]
I do too.

[00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:23.720]
Let's go up to that thousand so we can smit-can.

[00:55:23.840 --> 00:55:24.540]
There's 983.

[00:55:24.660 --> 00:55:26.160]
They're starting to come in in little chunks now.

[00:55:26.800 --> 00:55:28.680]
Got that song by Billie J. Kramer, little chunks.

[00:55:29.140 --> 00:55:30.020]
That'll won't play it.

[00:55:30.380 --> 00:55:31.000]
All right, it's Chillens.

[00:55:31.980 --> 00:55:34.960]
And his really archaeologist today said he found the tomb of King Herod.

[00:55:35.560 --> 00:55:36.200]
King Herod.

[00:55:36.260 --> 00:55:37.160]
Oh, my God.

[00:55:37.280 --> 00:55:39.860]
That in 40 cents will buy about a third of a cup of coffee at Starbucks.

[00:55:41.100 --> 00:55:43.440]
King Herod, the legendary builder of ancient Jerusalem,

[00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:48.560]
in the Holy Land, a potentially major discovery that kept a 35-year quest for the researcher.

[00:55:49.640 --> 00:55:51.760]
See, this is the kind of thing that people waste their money on.

[00:55:51.860 --> 00:55:54.460]
Just like that, the royal banquet and the royal ball,

[00:55:54.780 --> 00:55:57.500]
and the royal balls at the White House yesterday with the queen.

[00:55:57.800 --> 00:55:58.720]
How much taxpayer money?

[00:55:58.920 --> 00:56:01.000]
How much of your money, folks, do you think what to-

[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:04.100]
was peed down the drain that put that extravaganza on?

[00:56:04.500 --> 00:56:05.340]
To feed the queen.

[00:56:07.540 --> 00:56:08.300]
Crazy bastards.

[00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:09.860]
This is what goes on in the world, man.

[00:56:10.860 --> 00:56:14.580]
Hebrew University archaeologist Ejud Netser, or I love that, Ejud,

[00:56:15.160 --> 00:56:18.580]
said the bomb was found at Herodium, a flattened hilltop in the Judean desert,

[00:56:18.660 --> 00:56:20.180]
where Herod built a palace compound.

[00:56:20.700 --> 00:56:24.540]
Netser's been working at the site, a site just outside Jerusalem since 1972.

[00:56:25.040 --> 00:56:26.220]
He's been working feverishly.

[00:56:27.140 --> 00:56:32.700]
Netser said the tomb is discovered when a team of researchers found pieces of a limestone sarcophagus,

[00:56:33.420 --> 00:56:35.380]
believed to belong to the ancient king.

[00:56:36.100 --> 00:56:39.720]
Although there were no bones in the container, he said the sarcophagus's location

[00:56:39.720 --> 00:56:43.780]
and ornate appearance indicated it is Herod's sarcophagus.

[00:56:43.920 --> 00:56:44.480]
It's sarcophagus, my ass.

[00:56:44.540 --> 00:56:45.260]
Yes, sarcophagus.

[00:56:45.340 --> 00:56:46.460]
Yeah, we will when you die.

[00:56:46.920 --> 00:56:47.920]
Yeah, I'm sure you will.

[00:56:48.240 --> 00:56:50.700]
I'm getting bombed.

[00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:52.480]
I heard you were getting screen-aided.

[00:56:54.040 --> 00:56:55.800]
You call me a screamer?

[00:56:57.760 --> 00:56:58.160]
FAAAAMING!

[00:56:58.440 --> 00:57:00.040]
It's the sarcophagus we just don't-

[00:57:00.040 --> 00:57:00.900]
we don't see anywhere.

[00:57:01.020 --> 00:57:03.260]
Netser said a news conference is something very special.

[00:57:03.260 --> 00:57:06.560]
Netser who led the team city was not at the site when the sarcophagus was found.

[00:57:06.700 --> 00:57:07.560]
Then that's what a shame.

[00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:13.180]
Stefan Fan, an expert in the second temple period at the University of the Holy Land,

[00:57:13.640 --> 00:57:16.700]
called to find a major discovery by all means but cautioned for the researchers needed.

[00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:19.180]
He said all signs indicate the tomb belongs to Herod.

[00:57:19.520 --> 00:57:20.200]
We'll give it back then.

[00:57:20.660 --> 00:57:23.320]
But said ruins were an inscription on them were needed for full verification.

[00:57:23.880 --> 00:57:24.420]
You be Herod?

[00:57:24.620 --> 00:57:24.820]
No.

[00:57:25.460 --> 00:57:25.700]
Wrong.

[00:57:26.080 --> 00:57:26.460]
Herod?

[00:57:27.200 --> 00:57:28.220]
What is it?

[00:57:28.620 --> 00:57:28.940]
It's a hesitate.

[00:57:30.140 --> 00:57:31.360]
We're moving in the right direction.

[00:57:31.440 --> 00:57:35.060]
It'll be cleansed once we have an inscription that bears his name, said Fan, a textual scholar

[00:57:35.060 --> 00:57:36.900]
who did not participate in the dig.

[00:57:37.540 --> 00:57:37.660]
Dig?

[00:57:38.380 --> 00:57:41.960]
A fragment of the Carve Limes stone found at the sandy site are decorated with floral motors

[00:57:41.960 --> 00:57:43.280]
but did not include any inscriptions.

[00:57:43.780 --> 00:57:46.880]
Herod became ruler of the Holy Land under the Romans around 40 BC.

[00:57:47.280 --> 00:57:49.360]
That's why you gotta go to Rome to see all the ruins, baby.

[00:57:49.520 --> 00:57:49.860]
It's old.

[00:57:50.240 --> 00:57:50.720]
It's old.

[00:57:50.880 --> 00:57:51.520]
It's craggy.

[00:57:51.880 --> 00:57:53.420]
And the old, a tiny women are saggy.

[00:57:54.220 --> 00:57:57.780]
The wall he built around the old city of Jerusalem during the time of the Jewish Second Temple

[00:57:57.780 --> 00:57:59.040]
is the one that can be seen today.

[00:57:59.340 --> 00:58:02.980]
He also undertook massive construction projects in Cesaria, Jericho.

[00:58:03.600 --> 00:58:04.480]
Let's see the real.

[00:58:05.020 --> 00:58:05.600]
What is it?

[00:58:05.740 --> 00:58:06.020]
Cesaria.

[00:58:07.560 --> 00:58:08.600]
Cesaria, yes.

[00:58:09.240 --> 00:58:10.500]
It rhymes like with diarrhea.

[00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:11.160]
Sorry.

[00:58:11.640 --> 00:58:12.840]
I don't like the way that sounds.

[00:58:13.140 --> 00:58:14.440]
Cesaria, Jericho.

[00:58:14.780 --> 00:58:15.620]
It's just Cesaria.

[00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:17.220]
It's just like some kind of an illness.

[00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:20.540]
They hope to have fortress of Masada and other locations.

[00:58:20.740 --> 00:58:21.300]
Oh, Masada.

[00:58:21.440 --> 00:58:22.080]
That's right.

[00:58:22.880 --> 00:58:23.400]
Masada.

[00:58:23.680 --> 00:58:25.000]
Like Isabel de Cassada.

[00:58:25.880 --> 00:58:27.040]
What ever happened to her anywhere?

[00:58:27.160 --> 00:58:27.560]
What was her name?

[00:58:28.060 --> 00:58:28.780]
I don't know what I was going to say.

[00:58:29.080 --> 00:58:30.040]
Isabel de Cassada.

[00:58:30.320 --> 00:58:31.540]
Oh, I hated her.

[00:58:31.880 --> 00:58:33.940]
Hey, what was I was sending this man tossed in garbage truck.

[00:58:33.940 --> 00:58:36.360]
We've gotten five faxes on it already from this guy.

[00:58:36.360 --> 00:58:37.420]
And go ahead, send it up.

[00:58:37.500 --> 00:58:37.880]
Right now.

[00:58:38.060 --> 00:58:38.260]
You can't read it.

[00:58:38.420 --> 00:58:39.100]
You can't read it.

[00:58:39.260 --> 00:58:40.500]
They need to stop sending it.

[00:58:40.840 --> 00:58:42.340]
You have to be happy that I can read it.

[00:58:42.340 --> 00:58:42.520]
No.

[00:58:43.400 --> 00:58:44.460]
They need to stop.

[00:58:44.600 --> 00:58:45.640]
Why are you asking me that?

[00:58:45.720 --> 00:58:46.700]
Because I've never seen you.

[00:58:46.780 --> 00:58:47.680]
I'm telling you, it doesn't stop.

[00:58:48.200 --> 00:58:48.360]
Stop.

[00:58:48.960 --> 00:58:49.900]
Stop, stop, stop.

[00:58:50.400 --> 00:58:50.840]
Who did that?

[00:58:50.840 --> 00:58:51.500]
The Holly stopped.

[00:58:51.600 --> 00:58:51.740]
Yes.

[00:58:54.780 --> 00:58:54.780]

[00:58:54.780 --> 00:58:58.240]
And then Herod was buried at Herodium, but decades of excavations fell to turn up the

[00:58:58.240 --> 00:58:58.960]
side until now.

[00:58:59.280 --> 00:59:02.460]
The first century historian Josephus Flavius described the tomb of Herod's funeral.

[00:59:04.420 --> 00:59:05.140]
Josephus Flavius.

[00:59:06.040 --> 00:59:08.040]
I wonder who was king the biggest nicoce?

[00:59:09.600 --> 00:59:10.720]
I wonder how this thing started.

[00:59:11.160 --> 00:59:11.540]
Right here.

[00:59:11.820 --> 00:59:15.700]
See the good things, symbols, other things, as they're in through the doors.

[00:59:15.820 --> 00:59:16.180]
Stop.

[00:59:17.160 --> 00:59:17.520]
Stop.

[00:59:17.700 --> 00:59:18.840]
I was just doing the name of the song.

[00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:19.160]
I was not.

[00:59:19.160 --> 00:59:19.660]
I was not.

[00:59:19.780 --> 00:59:20.420]
But that's a good idea.

[00:59:20.520 --> 00:59:20.880]
Good time, yeah.

[00:59:21.740 --> 00:59:26.200]
It's long been assumed that the first century historian Josephus Flavius, brother to

[00:59:26.200 --> 00:59:29.200]
biggest wikis, described the tomb in Herod's funeral procession.

[00:59:29.740 --> 00:59:33.420]
Herodium was one of the last strong points held by Jewish rebels fighting against the

[00:59:33.420 --> 00:59:33.880]
Romans.

[00:59:34.900 --> 00:59:37.640]
And it was, what does it say?

[00:59:37.820 --> 00:59:42.500]
Concord and destroyed by Roman rulers in 8071, a year after they destroyed the second

[00:59:42.500 --> 00:59:43.240]
temple in Jerusalem.

[00:59:43.820 --> 00:59:44.620]
Those are Romans, man.

[00:59:44.780 --> 00:59:46.520]
They were killing the Christians and the Jews and everybody.

[00:59:47.720 --> 00:59:48.840]
Sounds like George Bush.

[00:59:49.840 --> 00:59:52.740]
Heber University had hoped to keep the finest secrets until next year's news conference

[00:59:52.740 --> 00:59:56.020]
today, but the university announced to find a debris statement yesterday after the

[00:59:56.020 --> 01:00:00.000]
Horrits Daily found out about the discovery, publishing articles on its website, Horrits,

[01:00:00.460 --> 01:00:01.480]
another one of those Jew papers.

[01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:02.600]
Jews, Jeffers.

[01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:05.220]
You read the newspapers of the Jews papers.

[01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:06.160]
That's what I like to know.

[01:00:06.380 --> 01:00:07.460]
And when's the next Jewish holiday?

[01:00:07.660 --> 01:00:09.620]
I'll get better get that sheet out again so I can take it off.

[01:00:09.820 --> 01:00:12.340]
I'm going to start taking all the Jew holidays off and if they don't let me have them, I'm

[01:00:12.340 --> 01:00:12.980]
going to sue their ass.

[01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:13.620]
All right.

[01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:14.660]
You're going to do their ass.

[01:00:14.860 --> 01:00:16.200]
You can take off like on Mayday.

[01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:19.520]
998 on the pool.

[01:00:19.780 --> 01:00:20.360]
Two more votes.

[01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:22.660]
If I click this couple more times, we get 999.

[01:00:23.100 --> 01:00:24.520]
Well, this thing's moving along, you know what?

[01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:26.820]
Maybe we have a little bit of the audience back.

[01:00:28.220 --> 01:00:29.100]
I doubt it though.

[01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:31.360]
Maybe it's all that big QAim promotion.

[01:00:31.580 --> 01:00:35.240]
You think you, and you notice not one word has ever been spoken like when Jolly Joe called

[01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:35.680]
me on Friday.

[01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:38.560]
I don't even utter that word because it's just utter nonsense, you know?

[01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:39.300]
It's a promotion.

[01:00:39.460 --> 01:00:39.720]
It's a vacation.

[01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:40.480]
That's vertusment.

[01:00:42.660 --> 01:00:45.440]
Oh, look at that Chris Chris is singing a song.

[01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:46.520]
I'm going to roll in the law.

[01:00:47.100 --> 01:00:47.680]
Thousand votes.

[01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:49.440]
Okay, let me print it out.

[01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:51.120]
I'm going to print it out and then I'm going to change it.

[01:00:51.940 --> 01:00:52.900]
Won't this be exciting?

[01:00:53.260 --> 01:00:54.560]
It's only a day of 1130 yet.

[01:00:55.500 --> 01:00:57.060]
And why are we changing the pool to the middle show?

[01:00:57.060 --> 01:00:59.400]
Well, because it's woodmine Tuesday, I'm not going to be here to change you later.

[01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:00.980]
And I don't want to put all that pressure on George.

[01:01:01.300 --> 01:01:02.360]
He'll be taking a cat mat.

[01:01:03.220 --> 01:01:04.860]
I'll be digesting this melting pot food.

[01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:05.060]
I'm eating.

[01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:06.940]
You got melting pot today?

[01:01:07.020 --> 01:01:07.180]
Yeah.

[01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:08.940]
I'll pass it over.

[01:01:09.060 --> 01:01:09.720]
I'll pass it along.

[01:01:09.740 --> 01:01:10.320]
I'll be good to meet.

[01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:12.280]
Because I'm staying on the atkins.

[01:01:13.260 --> 01:01:13.840]
Are you leaving?

[01:01:13.980 --> 01:01:14.420]
Nothing but meat.

[01:01:14.540 --> 01:01:14.820]
I am.

[01:01:15.220 --> 01:01:18.100]
And you know, it's really interesting, but it's seeing, I could be wrong, but it seems

[01:01:18.100 --> 01:01:21.520]
to me that once upon a time you were put, once upon a time in America, you were poo-pooing

[01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:21.960]
the atkins.

[01:01:22.220 --> 01:01:25.840]
What I was poo-pooing was that the show had turned into diet talk for fat people and

[01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:26.800]
little else for a while there.

[01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:28.980]
Oh, here we go.

[01:01:29.060 --> 01:01:29.240]
Yeah.

[01:01:29.420 --> 01:01:30.700]
I never said that it wasn't a good diet.

[01:01:30.940 --> 01:01:31.080]
Nice talk.

[01:01:31.460 --> 01:01:32.220]
It's diet talk.

[01:01:32.420 --> 01:01:33.140]
It's hockey talk.

[01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:35.140]
We sooner or later we get around to everything.

[01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:36.180]
Okay, we're doing just fine.

[01:01:36.340 --> 01:01:38.900]
I don't need any instructions, especially from a little punk like you.

[01:01:39.260 --> 01:01:39.980]
I want to talk about it.

[01:01:40.660 --> 01:01:42.640]
If you would have been as informative talking about hockey.

[01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:46.640]
And those days I was answering the phone and all the calls would be, what is this?

[01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:47.620]
Is this okay on the atkins?

[01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:50.160]
I would say I don't know and then they would say, well, why don't you know and I think

[01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:51.040]
it's about a thousand bucks.

[01:01:51.300 --> 01:01:51.540]
I don't know.

[01:01:51.540 --> 01:01:51.980]
I don't know.

[01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:53.040]
What was your piece?

[01:01:54.020 --> 01:01:55.220]
I wish I'd gotten a piece.

[01:01:55.340 --> 01:01:59.380]
If I had any brands, he inscribed a nice autograph on my one of my book about vitamins

[01:01:59.380 --> 01:01:59.740]
and stuff.

[01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:00.700]
How much is that worth?

[01:02:01.100 --> 01:02:01.300]
Nothing.

[01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:03.100]
Okay, here's the new pool.

[01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:03.860]
I just put it on there.

[01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:05.480]
I'm the owner of an overactive blank.

[01:02:06.420 --> 01:02:12.020]
Bladder, bowels, craving for food, fart maker, hypochondria, imagination, impulsed

[01:02:12.020 --> 01:02:13.740]
to call video talk shows with nothing to say.

[01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:15.820]
Mental disorder spelled wrong.

[01:02:16.340 --> 01:02:18.880]
Eric mental has no first A in it there.

[01:02:19.020 --> 01:02:20.260]
Okay, it says mental disease.

[01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:23.260]
I think Eric's crumbling under the pressure.

[01:02:23.420 --> 01:02:24.220]
He'll correct it.

[01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:28.360]
Trust me or else nervous system paranoia sex drive.

[01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:29.260]
Oh, that's me.

[01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:33.900]
Sweat glands thirst thyroid or nothing overactive with me sex drive.

[01:02:33.900 --> 01:02:34.800]
I click that right now.

[01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:35.100]
Let's see.

[01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:36.020]
We got any votes on there.

[01:02:36.020 --> 01:02:36.800]
You know, I just voted.

[01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:38.820]
It's oh yeah.

[01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:40.020]
One for imagination.

[01:02:40.020 --> 01:02:40.940]
We got three votes.

[01:02:41.860 --> 01:02:44.280]
One for imagination white for hypochondria.

[01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:45.520]
Three votes.

[01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:48.340]
One thing about us though, we show up.

[01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:51.220]
I enjoy just out sick a lot because not as much as used to be though.

[01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:52.240]
I was like last year.

[01:02:52.700 --> 01:02:54.160]
Was it last year you were always on sick?

[01:02:54.320 --> 01:02:55.560]
Yeah, I was having, I don't know what.

[01:02:56.860 --> 01:02:57.220]
Problems.

[01:02:57.220 --> 01:02:59.060]
Well, that's a good news.

[01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:00.220]
George doesn't have any more problems.

[01:03:00.460 --> 01:03:00.560]
Yeah.

[01:03:03.300 --> 01:03:04.240]
It's news to him.

[01:03:04.300 --> 01:03:06.940]
He just found out right here on the informative near Roger show.

[01:03:07.140 --> 01:03:08.480]
Oh, sex drives up to three now.

[01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:10.040]
Be all proven overactive.

[01:03:11.820 --> 01:03:13.200]
Or maybe it's underactive.

[01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:14.960]
Should we put that?

[01:03:15.820 --> 01:03:17.120]
Or we don't have that many women listening.

[01:03:17.300 --> 01:03:18.420]
So why the hell should we put underactive?

[01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:28.540]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

[01:03:28.540 --> 01:03:31.700]
Couple down the hips with Casey Jason.

[01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:34.000]
Hi, hi, Casey, Casey.

[01:03:34.500 --> 01:03:38.220]
Welcome back to our countdown of this week's Talk 20 ring tones.

[01:03:38.220 --> 01:03:41.120]
We're up to our number one ring tone of the week.

[01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:46.080]
But first, our unlimited coast to coast, long distance request and dedication.

[01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:48.020]
It's from Jessica S.

[01:03:48.700 --> 01:03:49.920]
She writes, dear Casey.

[01:03:50.700 --> 01:03:54.420]
Recently, my sister was caught lip-sinking on national TV.

[01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:56.740]
At first, she blamed her band.

[01:03:57.260 --> 01:03:59.820]
And then, she blamed her asses, re-blocks.

[01:04:00.180 --> 01:04:00.980]
Whatever that is.

[01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:06.540]
Anyway, Casey, since everyone thinks I'm the stupid one of the family, could you play

[01:04:06.540 --> 01:04:09.800]
Green Day's American Idiot for my sister, Ashley?

[01:04:10.380 --> 01:04:11.400]
Signed Jessica.

[01:04:11.980 --> 01:04:18.600]
So from Jessica to Ashley, here's your unlimited coast to coast, long distance request and dedication.

[01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:32.200]
That's American Idiot from Jessica to Ashley.

[01:04:32.580 --> 01:04:33.820]
Now, on with the countdown.

[01:04:36.900 --> 01:04:40.340]
But first, let's recap our top three ring tones.

[01:04:40.580 --> 01:04:41.240]
Number three.

[01:04:41.360 --> 01:04:44.320]
Coming at it number three, Rondo Eleaterka by Mozart.

[01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:56.480]
At number two, that tune that sounds like heart and soul, but is it?

[01:05:00.020 --> 01:05:03.100]
And now, this week's number one ring tone.

[01:05:03.100 --> 01:05:04.020]
Number one.

[01:05:04.340 --> 01:05:07.620]
For the third week in a row, Walsh of the Flowers.

[01:05:17.780 --> 01:05:19.020]
There you have it.

[01:05:19.320 --> 01:05:25.020]
The top 20 ring tones in America as tabulated by Fond Hill Board magazine to win it your

[01:05:25.020 --> 01:05:25.560]
next week.

[01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:29.060]
But it will once again count down America's top 20 ring tones.

[01:05:29.060 --> 01:05:34.160]
I'm Casey K. Zim saying keep your volume turned down and keep reaching for four

[01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:34.680]
bars.

[01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:38.300]
Yeah, reach to this.

[01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:40.160]
I was at the 20th, Scott the Queen's picture on it.

[01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:41.080]
Oh, brother, 11.

[01:05:41.460 --> 01:05:41.740]
Yes.

[01:05:41.880 --> 01:05:44.780]
The risk was something like all the fat lardos that used to call in during those shows.

[01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:45.740]
There is a problem with that.

[01:05:45.740 --> 01:05:48.860]
Partly mostly sunny and 85 in a slight chance of showers.

[01:05:48.860 --> 01:05:49.360]
I got an eye.

[01:05:49.480 --> 01:05:49.980]
Okay, we're in.

[01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:50.600]
Okay, go ahead.

[01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:51.900]
Or mushrooms on the atkins.

[01:05:53.640 --> 01:05:55.020]
Are mushrooms on the atkins?

[01:05:55.080 --> 01:05:55.820]
I asked you first.

[01:05:56.360 --> 01:05:56.800]
Why not?

[01:05:56.800 --> 01:05:58.340]
Okay, I don't know.

[01:05:58.340 --> 01:06:00.040]
Because I'm thinking of tension about that.

[01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:01.200]
Not in the beginning stage.

[01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:02.400]
Let me ask you what are mushrooms.

[01:06:02.580 --> 01:06:03.480]
Mushrooms are vegetables.

[01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:05.700]
Yeah, but there are fungus.

[01:06:06.020 --> 01:06:06.580]
Or fungus.

[01:06:06.760 --> 01:06:06.760]

[01:06:06.760 --> 01:06:07.920]
There's a fungus among the guys.

[01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:09.080]
But they're considered to be vegetables.

[01:06:09.380 --> 01:06:11.920]
Okay, they have a little bit of carbs, but almost a none.

[01:06:12.180 --> 01:06:12.620]
Yeah, you're a fungi.

[01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:13.300]
That's what I heard.

[01:06:18.540 --> 01:06:22.320]
But anyway, yeah, you can have a little bit.

[01:06:22.460 --> 01:06:23.040]
And then I have one.

[01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:23.540]
Well, I have one.

[01:06:23.540 --> 01:06:30.100]
Okay, if you want to like fry them with some butter, which is okay on the atkins and some onions, which is certainly okay, but it's a veggie table.

[01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:31.300]
And it's got almost no carbs.

[01:06:31.500 --> 01:06:37.280]
What do I really want to waste any space in my stomach for a mushroom when I've got a plate full of lots to her and stay in shrimp?

[01:06:37.660 --> 01:06:38.400]
Because I love mushrooms.

[01:06:38.700 --> 01:06:40.300]
Oh, man, I love mushrooms on the atkins, man.

[01:06:40.580 --> 01:06:40.960]
I could eat.

[01:06:41.060 --> 01:06:41.700]
I could cook up.

[01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:45.780]
I could take the frying pan and cook up a pound of mushrooms and onions.

[01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:46.440]
Eat that all day.

[01:06:46.680 --> 01:06:49.820]
I'd have to take a bunch of roll-aids at the same time because I have odds of the real bad.

[01:06:50.820 --> 01:06:53.720]
But man, there ain't nobody loves shrooms and onions.

[01:06:53.820 --> 01:06:55.740]
I maybe Dave can pre-delight mushrooms better than I do.

[01:06:55.880 --> 01:06:57.180]
I'll cook it over here on a grand scale.

[01:06:57.180 --> 01:06:59.980]
I got like five skewers with things on them all going at the same time.

[01:07:01.500 --> 01:07:02.740]
Yeah, you're supposed to be alright.

[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:03.160]
Mm-hmm.

[01:07:04.260 --> 01:07:04.960]
WDQY and hello.

[01:07:05.700 --> 01:07:06.060]
Hello.

[01:07:06.540 --> 01:07:06.840]
Yes.

[01:07:07.260 --> 01:07:07.560]
Neil?

[01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:08.720]
Yes, I am.

[01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:09.980]
Hi, Neil. How are you doing?

[01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:10.960]
I'm doing great.

[01:07:11.300 --> 01:07:13.920]
I have the answer for you for a guy you what I'm going to do.

[01:07:14.580 --> 01:07:15.140]
Can we get Randy?

[01:07:15.560 --> 01:07:15.740]
No.

[01:07:17.280 --> 01:07:19.240]
It sits down from the Miltonborough Show.

[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:21.300]
Oh, that's the guy, right?

[01:07:21.660 --> 01:07:23.880]
He used to roll up his sleeves and do a pen.

[01:07:23.900 --> 01:07:25.100]
No wonder I couldn't think of it.

[01:07:25.160 --> 01:07:25.920]
Who the hell remembers him?

[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:26.960]
Well, I'm a little five.

[01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:27.620]
Me too.

[01:07:28.900 --> 01:07:30.320]
Okay, thanks a lot, Neil.

[01:07:30.540 --> 01:07:31.620]
Thank you.

[01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:31.780]
Thank you.

[01:07:31.780 --> 01:07:32.980]
I'll be right back.

[01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:34.360]
How do you like that?

[01:07:34.520 --> 01:07:34.820]
Sit still.

[01:07:34.860 --> 01:07:36.680]
I never would have thought of that from the Old Miltonborough Show.

[01:07:36.780 --> 01:07:37.560]
That's why I couldn't think of it.

[01:07:37.660 --> 01:07:38.600]
Tell you what I'm going to do.

[01:07:38.740 --> 01:07:39.500]
He was a guy.

[01:07:39.500 --> 01:07:40.800]
He was one of the people I'm sure.

[01:07:40.940 --> 01:07:42.100]
I'm sure one of the funny guy.

[01:07:42.380 --> 01:07:42.760]
He's dead.

[01:07:43.300 --> 01:07:46.180]
I mean, I'm not positive of that, but I would imagine it if not he ought to be.

[01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:48.060]
Because he'd be about 110 years old.

[01:07:48.260 --> 01:07:49.320]
Who wants to live to 110?

[01:07:49.620 --> 01:07:51.620]
Unless you're 109, you know, yeah, I guess.

[01:07:54.020 --> 01:07:54.340]
566705560.

[01:07:55.040 --> 01:07:56.880]
You know, this is the way I look at life.

[01:07:57.040 --> 01:07:58.020]
You take whatever you can get.

[01:07:58.220 --> 01:07:58.420]
You understand?

[01:07:58.680 --> 01:07:59.080]
Take whatever you can get.

[01:07:59.080 --> 01:07:59.560]
Yeah, you bet.

[01:08:00.520 --> 01:08:02.800]
If I can make it to 90, that's another 26 years.

[01:08:02.940 --> 01:08:04.400]
Can you imagine how dangerous I've been?

[01:08:04.620 --> 01:08:07.120]
And I still be here sitting talking to another 26 years.

[01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:11.000]
For somebody, I think if they don't re-up my deal here pretty soon,

[01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.560]
because they keep talking enormous this and this one's that.

[01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:14.540]
Well, it's a really big.

[01:08:14.780 --> 01:08:16.500]
Next to that often, this is our biggest contract.

[01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:19.120]
If we don't get it done next couple of weeks, I'm going across the street.

[01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:20.700]
Good play.

[01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:22.020]
To the Chinese market.

[01:08:22.860 --> 01:08:23.980]
Get some more candy bars.

[01:08:26.620 --> 01:08:27.340]
56670560.560.

[01:08:27.580 --> 01:08:28.940]
They've arrived in a singular wireless line.

[01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:32.740]
What kind of a horseball radio station doesn't put an uncompete in a guy's contract?

[01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:33.840]
Sure.

[01:08:33.980 --> 01:08:35.420]
I mean, what kind of a, huh?

[01:08:36.280 --> 01:08:39.240]
What kind of a minor bush league operation, Joel?

[01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:40.320]
There's something like that.

[01:08:40.440 --> 01:08:41.100]
Really stupid.

[01:08:41.460 --> 01:08:42.680]
But then again, they are stupid.

[01:08:43.320 --> 01:08:43.980]
WQRM, hello.

[01:08:44.560 --> 01:08:45.140]
Hello, Neil.

[01:08:45.620 --> 01:08:45.920]
Yes, sir.

[01:08:46.260 --> 01:08:46.960]
How are you doing today?

[01:08:47.340 --> 01:08:47.560]
Great.

[01:08:48.480 --> 01:08:51.460]
Listen, there's two articles in the local of the scum's at most.

[01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:53.320]
The two articles in there.

[01:08:54.060 --> 01:08:55.380]
The word looking at.

[01:08:56.100 --> 01:08:56.360]
Yeah.

[01:08:56.920 --> 01:09:00.060]
The minister and then some other crazy broad.

[01:09:01.380 --> 01:09:03.140]
Just before the list of the dead people.

[01:09:03.660 --> 01:09:04.000]
Take a look.

[01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:06.240]
Okay, well, thank you so much.

[01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:09.760]
WQRM, hello.

[01:09:10.280 --> 01:09:10.620]
Hey, Neil.

[01:09:10.700 --> 01:09:11.020]
How are you?

[01:09:11.320 --> 01:09:11.820]
Okay, sir.

[01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:14.840]
I was just at the bridge tender for like five minutes.

[01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:17.000]
Yeah, I have to say it.

[01:09:18.540 --> 01:09:19.520]
Oh, my goodness.

[01:09:21.020 --> 01:09:21.600]
That's not funny.

[01:09:23.900 --> 01:09:24.220]
What?

[01:09:24.340 --> 01:09:24.760]
I called Neil.

[01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:25.860]
I made a funny sound.

[01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:28.480]
There's like a Bobby there on the Am I space, Bobby?

[01:09:28.780 --> 01:09:31.140]
I called you up, but I remember he asked me for the phone number to call in.

[01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:33.840]
And then the next day I called him and made a funny sound.

[01:09:38.100 --> 01:09:38.680]
What's his mouth?

[01:09:39.220 --> 01:09:40.540]
He was making sounds with his mouth.

[01:09:40.740 --> 01:09:42.860]
Well, that's what we keep talking about making sounds with your mouth.

[01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:44.400]
How are we doing on this new pool?

[01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:46.140]
Let's take a look at this baby, shaping up.

[01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:47.560]
We got 53 votes already.

[01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:49.920]
It's only been on there about two shades of a lime stale.

[01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:52.740]
That's a lot better than five fingered roses.

[01:09:53.020 --> 01:09:54.480]
Or here's the end result of the first one.

[01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:55.460]
We had a thousand votes even.

[01:09:55.800 --> 01:09:56.360]
Well, I like that.

[01:09:56.940 --> 01:09:58.860]
I've printed that baby out just in the nicotine.

[01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:00.000]
Be honest.

[01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:01.680]
And I'm going to read the result.

[01:10:01.800 --> 01:10:02.320]
I hate that poll.

[01:10:02.620 --> 01:10:03.020]
Thousand votes.

[01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:03.440]
That's it.

[01:10:03.780 --> 01:10:03.820]
I'm going to read the poll.

[01:10:03.820 --> 01:10:03.820]

[01:10:03.820 --> 01:10:03.820]

[01:10:03.820 --> 01:10:03.820]

[01:10:03.820 --> 01:10:04.960]
I'm not going to read the result.

[01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:05.740]
It was not good.

[01:10:07.660 --> 01:10:09.080]
53 so far in the new pool.

[01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:11.380]
I'm the owner of an overactive sex drive 14.

[01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:12.100]
Oh, yeah.

[01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:13.800]
I'm ready right now.

[01:10:15.060 --> 01:10:17.440]
Farch maker nine, bladder nine.

[01:10:17.820 --> 01:10:19.140]
Nothing overactive with me.

[01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:19.560]
Six.

[01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:20.080]
Oh, yeah.

[01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:20.740]
I like these stories.

[01:10:21.220 --> 01:10:22.820]
Well, there's an ad for Sirius on there.

[01:10:22.920 --> 01:10:24.180]
And at the new Mercury, it's got Sirius.

[01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:25.520]
Where's the president of Sirius?

[01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:28.200]
In the last night they had a story about that.

[01:10:28.460 --> 01:10:30.080]
And Brian Williams, NBC News.

[01:10:30.220 --> 01:10:32.540]
And I kept thinking about that car.

[01:10:32.540 --> 01:10:35.380]
You know, he could have been the dumbest person I've ever spoken to.

[01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:36.720]
And boy, that covers a lot of territory.

[01:10:37.060 --> 01:10:37.520]
He was great.

[01:10:37.640 --> 01:10:38.380]
I hope he calls back.

[01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:39.640]
Yeah, the president of Sirius.

[01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:41.560]
Nothing overactive with me.

[01:10:41.700 --> 01:10:41.860]
Six.

[01:10:42.260 --> 01:10:43.540]
Imagination for overactive.

[01:10:43.780 --> 01:10:45.240]
Overactive craving for food for.

[01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:46.320]
Bowls for.

[01:10:46.580 --> 01:10:49.420]
Oh, mile would be so jealous if she were here to hear that.

[01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:51.160]
Nervous system two.

[01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:52.180]
Swecklands one.

[01:10:52.580 --> 01:10:54.760]
Impulsed a car radio talk shows with nothing to say one.

[01:10:55.240 --> 01:10:55.860]
Hypochumbia one.

[01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:57.180]
And nothing yet for thyroid thirst.

[01:10:57.660 --> 01:10:58.980]
Paranoia or mental disorder.

[01:10:59.220 --> 01:11:00.120]
Nice going around and spelling.

[01:11:00.500 --> 01:11:01.560]
Eric straighted it out.

[01:11:01.560 --> 01:11:03.320]
What I tell you about him and he is on.

[01:11:03.460 --> 01:11:04.340]
He's on his game.

[01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:05.680]
67 vote.

[01:11:06.580 --> 01:11:09.020]
On a brand new policy and then we can pull out scam.

[01:11:09.220 --> 01:11:10.080]
We can add the two together.

[01:11:10.300 --> 01:11:10.540]
Chris.

[01:11:11.220 --> 01:11:13.720]
And we can pretend we had like, you know, 12, 13 and revotes.

[01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:14.460]
What scam?

[01:11:15.180 --> 01:11:16.100]
That we always pull.

[01:11:16.300 --> 01:11:16.820]
Well, good timing.

[01:11:16.920 --> 01:11:17.760]
He didn't either back in the seat.

[01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:18.400]
Good.

[01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:19.460]
WQYM. Hello.

[01:11:19.980 --> 01:11:20.340]
George.

[01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:21.520]
Yeah.

[01:11:22.340 --> 01:11:22.600]
Yeah.

[01:11:22.880 --> 01:11:23.780]
He'd be going on the phone.

[01:11:23.940 --> 01:11:24.260]
Cuba.

[01:11:27.220 --> 01:11:28.780]
Oh, it's called Mr. Matt.

[01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:29.600]
Now we're talking.

[01:11:29.820 --> 01:11:30.540]
I have my papers.

[01:11:31.260 --> 01:11:31.860]
WQYM. Hello.

[01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:33.060]
Hey, good morning.

[01:11:33.380 --> 01:11:33.880]
Yes, sir.

[01:11:34.280 --> 01:11:35.980]
Will you have a mix of the air and sea shells this year?

[01:11:36.540 --> 01:11:36.820]
No.

[01:11:37.700 --> 01:11:39.480]
It was on the leave of all.

[01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:40.120]
Yeah.

[01:11:41.260 --> 01:11:43.000]
What'd you see if he is sea shell.

[01:11:43.960 --> 01:11:45.220]
Sea shells by the sea shore.

[01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:47.220]
Yeah, it was on and nothing to say.

[01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:47.580]
Smart.

[01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:51.260]
Yeah, I came on down just to see the air and sea show to see.

[01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:52.120]
Oh, there's a plane.

[01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:54.540]
I wanted to do my herbivorous chase, but I'm too tall.

[01:11:55.960 --> 01:11:57.640]
Now, isn't it supposed to be when you get older,

[01:11:57.640 --> 01:11:59.400]
your feet get fatter and they get whiter?

[01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:00.080]
Which is true.

[01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:01.000]
Your nose gets longer.

[01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:01.860]
And your what?

[01:12:02.620 --> 01:12:03.840]
Your nose gets longer.

[01:12:03.980 --> 01:12:05.160]
Your ears continue growing.

[01:12:05.580 --> 01:12:06.420]
Get out of here.

[01:12:06.540 --> 01:12:07.460]
You stand like a big ears.

[01:12:07.860 --> 01:12:08.480]
Yeah, I'm probably.

[01:12:09.060 --> 01:12:10.000]
Oh, am I nose?

[01:12:10.340 --> 01:12:10.560]
Yeah.

[01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:11.360]
They couldn't eat it.

[01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:11.960]
Nothing else though.

[01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:13.160]
How about your feet?

[01:12:13.980 --> 01:12:15.340]
My feet are getting whiter.

[01:12:15.620 --> 01:12:17.260]
They're like getting that platypus kind of thing.

[01:12:17.420 --> 01:12:18.380]
You know, and square like a Mexicans.

[01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:20.680]
They're getting really fat.

[01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:21.480]
My feet.

[01:12:21.940 --> 01:12:23.720]
Maybe all the fat is like drinking a...

[01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:25.560]
Or can you imagine how fat hangs feet must be?

[01:12:29.240 --> 01:12:31.500]
Wonderful WQA Air.

[01:12:32.320 --> 01:12:33.560]
What face?

[01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:43.600]
I had a chicken in pain.

[01:12:44.600 --> 01:12:46.220]
One day she flew away.

[01:12:47.140 --> 01:12:51.080]
To Tio on a web of moon is the double issue.

[01:12:52.220 --> 01:12:54.180]
But with our right wing censorship,

[01:12:54.180 --> 01:12:56.880]
there are words that mustn't slip.

[01:12:57.420 --> 01:13:00.740]
To tell you how I feel for K.

[01:13:00.940 --> 01:13:02.760]
Hey, for K.

[01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:06.180]
So...

[01:13:06.820 --> 01:13:10.480]
With QCK into one of them.

[01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:11.820]
I'll see you with G.

[01:13:12.180 --> 01:13:13.160]
You wanna do.

[01:13:14.140 --> 01:13:17.920]
Now if you see K, tell her I miss her each day.

[01:13:18.520 --> 01:13:20.920]
And the FCC won't let me sing this.

[01:13:20.920 --> 01:13:23.920]
From my roasted day out at the CK,

[01:13:24.340 --> 01:13:26.260]
Take her hand, gently say.

[01:13:26.680 --> 01:13:28.420]
That after this transmission,

[01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:30.920]
I'll be out in 90 days old.

[01:13:31.260 --> 01:13:33.920]
With QCK into one of them.

[01:13:34.920 --> 01:13:36.160]
I'll see you with G.

[01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:38.220]
You wanna go, wanna go,

[01:13:38.500 --> 01:13:40.220]
But God I'll see you with G.

[01:13:40.600 --> 01:13:41.500]
You wanna do.

[01:13:46.660 --> 01:13:48.680]
So what ever happened with him, Gaterman?

[01:13:48.680 --> 01:13:49.900]
And we know, is he still alive?

[01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:50.900]
I don't know.

[01:13:51.180 --> 01:13:51.560]
I'll ask him.

[01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:51.720]

[01:13:51.740 --> 01:13:51.940]
I'll ask him.

[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:52.760]
I'll ask him.

[01:13:52.760 --> 01:13:55.580]
Check each mechle or whatever his friend's name was.

[01:13:55.900 --> 01:13:58.200]
I think he's in West Palm doing the lounge act.

[01:13:59.140 --> 01:13:59.580]
Are you sir?

[01:14:00.280 --> 01:14:01.580]
Last I heard, but I could be wrong.

[01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:02.100]
Are you sure?

[01:14:02.500 --> 01:14:03.760]
How do you make a living doing that?

[01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:05.200]
He makes a very good living,

[01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:08.320]
wearing a tuxedo and playing piano in those she-sheet places

[01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:10.580]
where they tip you with those big, brandy snifters.

[01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:11.840]
She-sheet?

[01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:12.020]
Yeah.

[01:14:12.460 --> 01:14:13.520]
How about he-sheet places?

[01:14:14.160 --> 01:14:15.160]
I'm sure those are of...

[01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:16.340]
And how about food places?

[01:14:16.740 --> 01:14:17.440]
He-he, and he-he-

[01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:18.580]
And he had both done the pull on the new one.

[01:14:18.680 --> 01:14:18.860]
Wow!

[01:14:19.060 --> 01:14:20.700]
This thing is gonna be phenomenal!

[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:22.980]
Chris agrees, I'm sure.

[01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:23.780]
Now, across the other...

[01:14:23.780 --> 01:14:26.260]
Oh yeah, Chris, Chris is the one back in there, because the food came in.

[01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:27.600]
Right.

[01:14:27.720 --> 01:14:29.080]
Now that should be just fine for you.

[01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:31.280]
You should be sticking to the act and stuff, if you just stick with me.

[01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:32.260]
And you don't-

[01:14:32.260 --> 01:14:32.500]
What?

[01:14:32.720 --> 01:14:32.980]
He did.

[01:14:33.540 --> 01:14:33.780]
Good.

[01:14:34.300 --> 01:14:36.880]
And all those desserts don't be dipping and dunking like a cake.

[01:14:37.380 --> 01:14:39.940]
And Martian does stuff and that wild chocolate you know?

[01:14:41.020 --> 01:14:42.200]
Good stuff, don't not do.

[01:14:42.780 --> 01:14:43.340]
Not for you.

[01:14:43.780 --> 01:14:44.280]
Don't start walking.

[01:14:44.280 --> 01:14:44.840]
Why is it that?

[01:14:45.140 --> 01:14:46.100]
People are, you know, you attempt.

[01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:46.540]
You attempt.

[01:14:46.540 --> 01:14:46.980]
Is it there?

[01:14:47.180 --> 01:14:48.240]
No, no, it isn't.

[01:14:48.300 --> 01:14:49.040]
They didn't bring any dessert.

[01:14:49.200 --> 01:14:49.320]
No.

[01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:55.260]
By request, I told them, Duff, to tell the nice John that we were doing the atkins and they

[01:14:55.260 --> 01:14:55.820]
only brought me.

[01:14:56.180 --> 01:14:56.500]
And veggies.

[01:14:57.080 --> 01:14:58.340]
And we love them in melting pot and pot.

[01:14:58.340 --> 01:14:59.560]
By the way, tomorrow's Wednesday.

[01:14:59.620 --> 01:15:02.280]
It's throughout Wednesday, so I'm sure Duff has been really taking care of you guys tomorrow.

[01:15:03.060 --> 01:15:03.180]
Right.

[01:15:03.380 --> 01:15:04.640]
Don't worry about it.

[01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:06.220]
WDQ, I'm very worried about it.

[01:15:06.340 --> 01:15:06.600]
I'm upset.

[01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:07.240]
Q.A.M.

[01:15:07.320 --> 01:15:07.460]
Hello.

[01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:08.320]
How do Neil?

[01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:09.220]
Yes, sir.

[01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:10.820]
I don't really care much for Italian food.

[01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:12.420]
Why not?

[01:15:12.420 --> 01:15:14.940]
Well, I don't know, but I do like Italian food.

[01:15:15.180 --> 01:15:15.620]
Whoa!

[01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:20.080]
There you go.

[01:15:20.260 --> 01:15:21.220]
You fairy.

[01:15:22.120 --> 01:15:23.120]
WDQ, I am hello.

[01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:25.460]
Hey, Neil.

[01:15:25.860 --> 01:15:28.020]
I got to turn off my internet.

[01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:28.620]
Hold on.

[01:15:28.820 --> 01:15:29.600]
Turn off that thing.

[01:15:29.840 --> 01:15:29.840]

[01:15:30.300 --> 01:15:30.740]
I'll tell it.

[01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:34.000]
I am so excited because I love you.

[01:15:34.980 --> 01:15:38.000]
And my dad, that Jimmy Duranny called.

[01:15:38.660 --> 01:15:41.960]
That was my father down sweating in Florida.

[01:15:41.960 --> 01:15:42.860]
Yeah.

[01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:45.020]
I'm up in Tennessee.

[01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:47.800]
Listen to you on my internet and join you every day.

[01:15:48.060 --> 01:15:48.500]
Tennessee.

[01:15:48.860 --> 01:15:48.860]

[01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:49.840]
I'm home.

[01:15:50.200 --> 01:15:51.160]
What are you doing in Tennessee?

[01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:53.840]
My husband dragged me up here.

[01:15:54.280 --> 01:15:54.820]
Oh, God.

[01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:55.620]
I'm so sorry.

[01:15:55.820 --> 01:15:57.440]
That's how they get women up there in Tennessee.

[01:15:57.780 --> 01:15:57.960]
Yeah.

[01:15:58.160 --> 01:15:59.020]
They drag them forward.

[01:15:59.180 --> 01:16:00.100]
They drag them.

[01:16:00.660 --> 01:16:01.560]
They drug them.

[01:16:02.780 --> 01:16:03.900]
Listen to this.

[01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:11.620]
My daughter is in third grade and her teacher and the science books makes them mark out that the reptiles lived millions of years ago.

[01:16:11.620 --> 01:16:13.800]
And wrote in thousands.

[01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:14.480]
Yeah.

[01:16:14.700 --> 01:16:15.840]
Twenty-thirty years ago, yeah.

[01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:16.540]
Yeah.

[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:18.400]
With the dinosaurs who lived in Tennessee.

[01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:19.080]
Oh, this is in Tennessee.

[01:16:19.260 --> 01:16:19.800]
I had them in ease.

[01:16:19.900 --> 01:16:20.000]
Yep.

[01:16:20.440 --> 01:16:22.300]
Well, of course there's lots of tourists in Tennessee.

[01:16:23.400 --> 01:16:23.760]
Tourists.

[01:16:24.820 --> 01:16:24.920]
Tourists.

[01:16:25.060 --> 01:16:25.420]
Tourists.

[01:16:25.820 --> 01:16:27.720]
Well, listen, have a great life and a good lucky.

[01:16:27.900 --> 01:16:28.240]
I think you'll need it.

[01:16:28.360 --> 01:16:28.740]
Thank you.

[01:16:29.020 --> 01:16:29.560]
See you.

[01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:30.160]
Okay.

[01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:31.920]
Wasn't she an ice unfortunately or a husband?

[01:16:32.460 --> 01:16:33.680]
Isn't it usually the other way around?

[01:16:34.660 --> 01:16:35.100]
I don't know.

[01:16:35.200 --> 01:16:35.600]
I guess not.

[01:16:35.820 --> 01:16:37.540]
Like, the guys have to move for work.

[01:16:37.640 --> 01:16:38.160]
That kind of thing.

[01:16:38.180 --> 01:16:39.200]
So they drag their wives along.

[01:16:39.380 --> 01:16:40.380]
Oh, my God.

[01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:41.280]
Geez.

[01:16:41.320 --> 01:16:43.060]
I had a tober dump his ass.

[01:16:43.460 --> 01:16:45.240]
Unless it was extraordinarily good in the set.

[01:16:45.240 --> 01:16:45.940]
That's one of the two of us.

[01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.480]
Really good provider and making lots and lots of money.

[01:16:49.280 --> 01:16:51.380]
108 votes on the new pool and six.

[01:16:51.720 --> 01:16:53.540]
I'm the owner of an overactive six drive 24.

[01:16:53.980 --> 01:16:56.140]
Seems to be leading all the way to head a fart maker.

[01:16:56.400 --> 01:16:57.380]
Those two are kind of incompatible.

[01:16:58.120 --> 01:16:58.380]
Mm-hmm.

[01:16:59.860 --> 01:17:01.600]
That's one thing about having a partner.

[01:17:01.760 --> 01:17:03.440]
A fart maker is just not unknown.

[01:17:03.680 --> 01:17:04.180]
A partner?

[01:17:04.620 --> 01:17:05.440]
A fart in a year.

[01:17:06.120 --> 01:17:06.520]
Yeah.

[01:17:06.860 --> 01:17:07.780]
WDQ-YM, hello.

[01:17:08.160 --> 01:17:10.080]
Yeah, and then I help previously that after

[01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:11.440]
the June hour, a million June,

[01:17:11.440 --> 01:17:13.420]
it's going to be due to a lot of your shows, huh?

[01:17:13.640 --> 01:17:13.720]
Yeah.

[01:17:14.780 --> 01:17:17.320]
How can you let a man face a medic like him do a show?

[01:17:17.460 --> 01:17:18.480]
Your world's an agrarian.

[01:17:19.660 --> 01:17:20.680]
How can you do that?

[01:17:21.700 --> 01:17:22.840]
How can I do one thing?

[01:17:22.840 --> 01:17:23.500]
Can you do that?

[01:17:23.580 --> 01:17:25.780]
I mean, please, you know, he should be a...

[01:17:25.780 --> 01:17:26.280]
How can you do that?

[01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:27.500]
How can the guys are street?

[01:17:28.180 --> 01:17:29.080]
Yeah, oh, I see.

[01:17:29.260 --> 01:17:30.000]
For the guys that's street.

[01:17:30.120 --> 01:17:32.060]
What about you, some kind of a Palestinian Mexican?

[01:17:32.700 --> 01:17:33.600]
Oh, he is.

[01:17:33.700 --> 01:17:35.000]
Bad cloney asset, man.

[01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:35.620]
Real bad one.

[01:17:37.020 --> 01:17:37.820]
WDQ-YM, hello.

[01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:40.200]
Go up, put on the guard, Vera.

[01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:41.860]
WDQ-YM, hello.

[01:17:42.680 --> 01:17:43.940]
Bob Green, please.

[01:17:44.820 --> 01:17:45.780]
Q-YM, hello.

[01:17:46.900 --> 01:17:47.300]
Hello.

[01:17:47.900 --> 01:17:48.280]
Yes, sir.

[01:17:49.980 --> 01:17:51.400]
I'm sorry, that was a new Roger.

[01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:52.520]
Speaking.

[01:17:53.340 --> 01:17:53.740]
Speaking.

[01:17:54.260 --> 01:17:55.580]
Turn that radio down, please.

[01:17:55.860 --> 01:17:57.420]
Hey, Neil, I love your band.

[01:17:57.980 --> 01:17:58.160]
Yeah.

[01:17:58.880 --> 01:18:01.560]
We listen to you guys for the past 10 years, man.

[01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:03.220]
And it's a writer, huh?

[01:18:03.900 --> 01:18:05.280]
Yeah, oh, man, I love you guys, man.

[01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:09.160]
10 to 12 o'clock every single day, man.

[01:18:09.260 --> 01:18:09.560]
I love you guys.

[01:18:09.560 --> 01:18:10.780]
What do you mean 10 to 12 o'clock?

[01:18:10.900 --> 01:18:12.260]
What do you do when you have to 12 o'clock?

[01:18:12.680 --> 01:18:16.020]
After 12 o'clock, I listen to the, you know, the hands and the other guys.

[01:18:17.340 --> 01:18:19.060]
Well, they have a lot of new, any other choice.

[01:18:20.060 --> 01:18:21.060]
At 12 o'clock?

[01:18:21.740 --> 01:18:22.060]
Yeah.

[01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:25.500]
Ask the community this, my amigo.

[01:18:26.200 --> 01:18:26.820]
Okay, ma'am, I'm sorry.

[01:18:26.900 --> 01:18:27.680]
You haven't had time, man.

[01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:28.280]
Okay, man.

[01:18:30.740 --> 01:18:31.060]
Wow.

[01:18:31.860 --> 01:18:33.160]
Humber is going to be on a new today.

[01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:34.360]
There's a no yet.

[01:18:34.700 --> 01:18:36.700]
The blood sugar will be down to 600 by then.

[01:18:36.900 --> 01:18:39.940]
I'm just trying to do something to give him, but you know something that kicked that home.

[01:18:41.640 --> 01:18:43.280]
I'm really looking for the band that's going, okay?

[01:18:43.520 --> 01:18:44.360]
I ain't going to help.

[01:18:44.500 --> 01:18:46.280]
I've been trying for years to talk him into it.

[01:18:46.520 --> 01:18:49.080]
Remember, I was going to buy him that the blood sugar thing to check his evil.

[01:18:49.080 --> 01:18:49.620]
Do it.

[01:18:49.720 --> 01:18:50.920]
What is it, the meter?

[01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:52.380]
Maybe he's got a death wish.

[01:18:52.600 --> 01:18:52.860]
I don't know.

[01:18:54.180 --> 01:18:56.180]
How can you be diabetic and not check your blood sugar?

[01:18:56.580 --> 01:19:00.200]
Yeah, I'm sure if you watch any TV, every 20 minutes there's another ad for another one.

[01:19:00.200 --> 01:19:02.480]
There's little machines, you know, check to prick your finger.

[01:19:02.480 --> 01:19:03.480]
And what do you call it?

[01:19:03.560 --> 01:19:05.120]
Bill Wilford Brimley talking about diabetes.

[01:19:05.480 --> 01:19:06.040]
There you go.

[01:19:06.100 --> 01:19:07.600]
Diabetes, dentist, plasma, liberty.

[01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:08.440]
Whatever her name is.

[01:19:08.500 --> 01:19:08.820]
What's her name?

[01:19:09.160 --> 01:19:11.480]
Oh, I saw Karen and I said it's not Karen Valentine.

[01:19:11.920 --> 01:19:12.220]
Who is it?

[01:19:12.240 --> 01:19:13.520]
The one with the Christie Ellie?

[01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:15.860]
The Barry Brimley?

[01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:17.380]
Yeah, the Barry Brimley.

[01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:18.520]
I saw that again last night.

[01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:19.980]
Have you got Jenny yet?

[01:19:20.700 --> 01:19:22.360]
Yeah, don't you want to look just like Christie Ellie?

[01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:23.280]
Oh, my God.

[01:19:23.560 --> 01:19:24.800]
Even I was getting mad.

[01:19:25.020 --> 01:19:31.700]
By the way, Boca Bryan says that guitar man is indeed in West Palm playing piano in the Ritsey place.

[01:19:31.700 --> 01:19:33.120]
Well, that's so sad.

[01:19:33.400 --> 01:19:33.900]
Q-A-M, hello.

[01:19:36.060 --> 01:19:36.800]
Q-A-M?

[01:19:39.300 --> 01:19:40.240]
That is a doornail.

[01:19:40.340 --> 01:19:40.940]
Q-A-M, hello.

[01:19:41.280 --> 01:19:42.060]
But, nah.

[01:19:43.400 --> 01:19:44.260]
WDQ-A-M, hello.

[01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:46.400]
What, these are spastic.

[01:19:46.560 --> 01:19:47.520]
WDQ-A-M, hola.

[01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:49.080]
Ro-Nero.

[01:19:50.340 --> 01:19:51.200]
WDQ-A-M, hello.

[01:19:52.200 --> 01:19:52.760]
Nero, come on.

[01:19:52.840 --> 01:19:53.900]
Nero, my whole world.

[01:19:54.920 --> 01:19:55.820]
WDQ-A-M, hello.

[01:19:56.860 --> 01:19:57.640]
Nero, how are you?

[01:19:58.060 --> 01:19:58.780]
Okay, how are you?

[01:19:59.280 --> 01:20:00.040]
Good, good, hey.

[01:20:00.420 --> 01:20:01.680]
Can you introduce yourself?

[01:20:01.680 --> 01:20:01.680]

[01:20:01.680 --> 01:20:01.680]

[01:20:01.680 --> 01:20:01.680]

[01:20:01.680 --> 01:20:01.680]

[01:20:01.680 --> 01:20:01.680]

[01:20:01.680 --> 01:20:01.680]

[01:20:01.680 --> 01:20:01.680]

[01:20:10.140 --> 01:20:22.840]
I'm a good person.

[01:20:22.840 --> 01:20:22.840]

[01:20:22.840 --> 01:20:22.840]

[01:20:22.840 --> 01:20:22.840]

[01:20:22.840 --> 01:20:22.860]
I'm a good person.

[01:20:22.860 --> 01:20:22.860]

[01:20:22.860 --> 01:20:22.860]

[01:20:22.860 --> 01:20:22.860]

[01:20:22.860 --> 01:20:22.860]

[01:20:22.860 --> 01:20:22.880]
I'm a good person.

[01:20:22.880 --> 01:20:22.880]

[01:20:22.880 --> 01:20:22.880]

[01:20:22.880 --> 01:20:22.880]

[01:20:22.880 --> 01:20:22.880]

[01:20:22.880 --> 01:20:22.880]

[01:20:22.880 --> 01:20:23.620]
I'm a good person.

[01:20:23.620 --> 01:20:23.620]

[01:20:23.620 --> 01:20:23.620]

[01:20:23.860 --> 01:20:23.860]

[01:20:23.860 --> 01:20:23.860]

[01:20:23.860 --> 01:20:23.860]

[01:20:23.880 --> 01:20:23.880]

[01:20:23.880 --> 01:20:23.880]

[01:20:23.880 --> 01:20:24.540]
I'm a good person.

[01:20:25.360 --> 01:20:27.860]
I'm a good person.

[01:20:28.120 --> 01:20:30.280]
I'm a good person.

[01:20:30.500 --> 01:20:31.660]
I'm a good person.

[01:20:33.380 --> 01:20:35.200]
Can we put him back on on what?

[01:20:35.320 --> 01:20:35.760]
On drugs?

[01:20:36.280 --> 01:20:37.280]
I am that hemorrhide.

[01:20:37.680 --> 01:20:38.040]
Wow.

[01:20:38.900 --> 01:20:40.400]
Okay, let's take a quick peek.

[01:20:40.700 --> 01:20:42.240]
I want to go to, what's this in Taiwan?

[01:20:42.520 --> 01:20:42.920]
You see this?

[01:20:43.080 --> 01:20:43.260]
Yeah.

[01:20:43.440 --> 01:20:44.260]
There's a time one on.

[01:20:44.340 --> 01:20:45.020]
I have a brawl.

[01:20:45.100 --> 01:20:46.800]
I wish our country was going to blow us over.

[01:20:46.960 --> 01:20:48.160]
I have a little fist fight there.

[01:20:48.260 --> 01:20:48.900]
The Taiwanese.

[01:20:49.060 --> 01:20:51.080]
You know, I'd watch sea spade if we had stuff like this going on.

[01:20:51.340 --> 01:20:51.760]
Oh, yeah.

[01:20:51.900 --> 01:20:52.660]
Just like the Canadian parliament.

[01:20:53.480 --> 01:20:54.920]
They're all pounding on the table and the group.

[01:20:54.920 --> 01:20:55.720]
Yeah, that's the same thing.

[01:20:55.980 --> 01:20:57.440]
These people start US Congress.

[01:20:57.580 --> 01:21:00.300]
They also do the general lady from California.

[01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:01.440]
Yeah, right.

[01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:02.600]
Look at the bullcrap.

[01:21:02.920 --> 01:21:03.560]
One, two, three.

[01:21:03.760 --> 01:21:04.820]
Oh, it's time for Little Landberry.

[01:21:05.300 --> 01:21:06.240]
And so we got on the new pool.

[01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:07.120]
One, two, three.

[01:21:08.140 --> 01:21:09.340]
Sure sounds good to me.

[01:21:11.060 --> 01:21:14.220]
I'm the owner of an overactive sex drive.

[01:21:15.040 --> 01:21:15.860]
It's pulling away.

[01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:16.340]
28.

[01:21:16.520 --> 01:21:16.860]
It's pulling.

[01:21:18.400 --> 01:21:22.140]
560-705-60-5060 on the Verizon singular wireless line.

[01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:24.160]
One, two, three.

[01:21:24.240 --> 01:21:24.560]
There he is.

[01:21:24.620 --> 01:21:26.400]
I wonder if he's dead in the line.

[01:21:27.400 --> 01:21:27.920]
I don't know.

[01:21:27.940 --> 01:21:28.280]
I think he's dead.

[01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:31.200]
I'll ask him that.

[01:21:31.300 --> 01:21:31.800]
I might see him.

[01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:32.640]
He also has some song.

[01:21:32.740 --> 01:21:33.360]
I looked at something.

[01:21:35.320 --> 01:21:36.300]
I looked at Traces.

[01:21:36.440 --> 01:21:37.220]
That was the OJs.

[01:21:37.280 --> 01:21:38.620]
He had, the lender had another header.

[01:21:38.840 --> 01:21:39.120]
Was that it?

[01:21:39.340 --> 01:21:40.460]
Was that a medley of his big?

[01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:41.600]
Let me, let me look.

[01:21:42.120 --> 01:21:42.660]
Take a puke.

[01:21:42.980 --> 01:21:43.160]
A peak.

[01:21:44.360 --> 01:21:44.900]
WQYM, hello.

[01:21:45.940 --> 01:21:46.260]
Hello?

[01:21:46.560 --> 01:21:46.700]
You?

[01:21:46.860 --> 01:21:47.540]
Yes, sir.

[01:21:48.540 --> 01:21:50.040]
Oh, you know, it's good to have you on the phone.

[01:21:50.320 --> 01:21:53.840]
Hey, I'm like, I haven't seen just in how we can fix all this Iraq story.

[01:21:54.700 --> 01:21:55.240]
I hope you're good.

[01:21:55.960 --> 01:21:56.500]
WQYM, hello.

[01:21:59.040 --> 01:21:59.420]
QYM.

[01:21:59.920 --> 01:22:03.540]
If I saw the David Cassidy special last night, what?

[01:22:06.980 --> 01:22:08.460]
That's the Galilee Eyes boyfriend.

[01:22:09.200 --> 01:22:11.000]
It must have had a wild evening after that.

[01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:12.680]
They must have put him right in the mood.

[01:22:13.040 --> 01:22:13.900]
A lot of butter, I imagine.

[01:22:14.780 --> 01:22:16.800]
A lot of Crisco, WQYM, hello.

[01:22:17.880 --> 01:22:18.120]
Hello?

[01:22:18.580 --> 01:22:19.060]
Yes, sir.

[01:22:19.460 --> 01:22:19.880]
Is this new?

[01:22:20.360 --> 01:22:21.280]
Sounds like me, yeah.

[01:22:21.480 --> 01:22:22.200]
Oh, okay.

[01:22:22.340 --> 01:22:22.600]
No problem.

[01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:24.100]
I love your show, by the way.

[01:22:24.540 --> 01:22:29.080]
What made me call was about the diabetes stuff to suffer.

[01:22:29.100 --> 01:22:29.880]
I have a very expensive.

[01:22:30.120 --> 01:22:32.080]
Even when you try to get that Liberty stuff.

[01:22:32.400 --> 01:22:32.980]
Yeah, diabetes.

[01:22:33.220 --> 01:22:34.540]
You're not on that Medicare.

[01:22:35.020 --> 01:22:35.560]
It's expensive.

[01:22:35.720 --> 01:22:37.000]
Like $60 from my wife.

[01:22:37.200 --> 01:22:38.060]
She has to pay for that.

[01:22:38.200 --> 01:22:39.840]
But the Apple for the machine is pretty expensive.

[01:22:40.600 --> 01:22:41.560]
Well, let me ask you a question.

[01:22:41.660 --> 01:22:42.620]
How much is your life worth?

[01:22:42.780 --> 01:22:43.660]
That's the obvious question.

[01:22:44.140 --> 01:22:45.300]
Well, that's not the problem.

[01:22:45.380 --> 01:22:45.880]
I'm the thing.

[01:22:46.060 --> 01:22:48.520]
And if you would say about the scripts, it's very, very expensive.

[01:22:49.240 --> 01:22:50.360]
Why do you tell me this?

[01:22:50.360 --> 01:22:51.740]
I've been buying them for a zillion years.

[01:22:51.820 --> 01:22:52.600]
Don't you think I know that?

[01:22:53.340 --> 01:22:54.240]
Yeah, but they will.

[01:22:54.320 --> 01:22:56.960]
I think the miserable present that they can get cheap.

[01:22:57.080 --> 01:23:00.040]
Well, then go to your robberies and buy them there, okay?

[01:23:00.240 --> 01:23:02.000]
And quit bitching about the Liberty and their whatever.

[01:23:02.280 --> 01:23:02.920]
Wilford Brimley.

[01:23:03.780 --> 01:23:04.720]
What's that guy talking about?

[01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:06.040]
What a meat, but a moop, but a moop.

[01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:06.620]
Through your expensive.

[01:23:07.040 --> 01:23:08.200]
George will take care of it for you.

[01:23:08.300 --> 01:23:09.100]
Send him to the bill every month.

[01:23:09.240 --> 01:23:10.540]
Okay, he'll take care of all your supplies.

[01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:11.360]
I'll set supplies.

[01:23:11.460 --> 01:23:12.840]
School supplies, diabetes supplies.

[01:23:13.640 --> 01:23:13.980]
I'll set supplies.

[01:23:14.160 --> 01:23:14.440]
I'll set supplies.

[01:23:15.180 --> 01:23:17.000]
Now, what's the story on that drum, by the way?

[01:23:18.480 --> 01:23:19.300]
I, uh, nothing.

[01:23:20.080 --> 01:23:20.700]
I asked Clevver.

[01:23:20.840 --> 01:23:21.640]
That's not acceptable.

[01:23:21.640 --> 01:23:23.920]
I'm going to blame you for it now because you're too much of a wimp.

[01:23:24.080 --> 01:23:24.880]
Too much of a woose.

[01:23:24.920 --> 01:23:25.680]
Or you're right about that.

[01:23:25.800 --> 01:23:27.280]
Push comes out of all buy it and expensive.

[01:23:27.780 --> 01:23:29.880]
And then they'll have a heart attack and maybe they'll fire me.

[01:23:29.980 --> 01:23:31.160]
But you don't understand.

[01:23:31.740 --> 01:23:33.100]
You can't wait until it dies.

[01:23:33.340 --> 01:23:35.900]
Does the, does the things say change drum soon?

[01:23:36.160 --> 01:23:36.300]
Yes.

[01:23:36.860 --> 01:23:37.620]
Well, change it.

[01:23:37.740 --> 01:23:38.000]
Okay.

[01:23:38.380 --> 01:23:41.200]
If a light came on on your ass, said change your underwear soon.

[01:23:41.320 --> 01:23:42.020]
Wouldn't you change it?

[01:23:42.140 --> 01:23:42.780]
I don't need the light.

[01:23:43.140 --> 01:23:44.140]
Well, there you go.

[01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:45.360]
Change the drum.

[01:23:45.600 --> 01:23:45.940]
I just, wait, wait, wait.

[01:23:45.940 --> 01:23:46.700]
Change the drum.

[01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:49.900]
Bang the drum slowly and change its back links.

[01:23:49.900 --> 01:23:51.260]
You're really messed.

[01:23:51.900 --> 01:23:52.980]
I'm telling you.

[01:23:53.140 --> 01:23:53.140]

[01:23:53.140 --> 01:23:53.900]
You're official, ho.

[01:23:54.020 --> 01:23:56.080]
Well, Miami Dolphins football.

[01:23:56.260 --> 01:23:58.300]
Jason Taylor basketball away.

[01:23:58.540 --> 01:24:00.640]
He swoops on the dashes into the end.

[01:24:00.900 --> 01:24:01.860]
Sports radio.

[01:24:02.580 --> 01:24:03.180]
560.

[01:24:04.080 --> 01:24:05.100]
G.A.M.

[01:24:05.380 --> 01:24:06.340]
Listen to the great equipment.

[01:24:06.780 --> 01:24:10.440]
Whenever I shape my ball, I listen to the meal Rogers 12-1 hour.

[01:24:12.540 --> 01:24:18.800]
You lost a coordinated time in the sour soul.

[01:24:18.800 --> 01:24:27.300]
All around the four-hole plums, having a small bowl.

[01:24:29.740 --> 01:24:32.800]
We'll take that stuff all the time.

[01:24:33.840 --> 01:24:36.400]
God bless, who play games.

[01:24:37.340 --> 01:24:44.080]
Can't keep the eyes apart behind insisting they're not gay.

[01:24:48.800 --> 01:24:53.660]
Now, you've got to hide your heart away.

[01:24:55.980 --> 01:25:01.780]
Now, you've got to hide your heart away.

[01:25:04.040 --> 01:25:10.960]
Town will shorten hardly passes that straight game will buy.

[01:25:12.140 --> 01:25:15.640]
Men who fall apart, run men.

[01:25:15.640 --> 01:25:18.900]
Give us four-hole, stays up in mind.

[01:25:19.760 --> 01:25:28.540]
Oh, girls, you've got four-hole wheels, having fun with the boys.

[01:25:29.560 --> 01:25:39.980]
In the locker room, I hear, boy and boy, boy and boy, boy and boy, boy, boy.

[01:25:42.200 --> 01:25:48.780]
You've got to hide your heart away.

[01:25:49.860 --> 01:25:53.740]
You've got to hide your heart away.

[01:25:58.300 --> 01:26:00.060]
Oh, guess what I just found.

[01:26:01.160 --> 01:26:01.660]
All right.

[01:26:03.120 --> 01:26:04.860]
Just thinking, pop it up on the floor.

[01:26:04.860 --> 01:26:05.520]
Let's have the babies.

[01:26:05.860 --> 01:26:06.020]
Wow.

[01:26:06.020 --> 01:26:08.240]
They want us to find a way.

[01:26:10.160 --> 01:26:12.640]
Holy moly, I shouldn't have said holy moly.

[01:26:12.760 --> 01:26:13.600]
That was a bad choice of words.

[01:26:14.100 --> 01:26:14.200]
Why?

[01:26:14.900 --> 01:26:15.500]
I don't know.

[01:26:16.500 --> 01:26:22.960]
I never forgot this, but on the inside of this, this is mo bits, volume one.

[01:26:23.220 --> 01:26:30.280]
On the inside of the cover in the CD, there's a picture of a guy that makes fat boy look like a midget sitting on the throne.

[01:26:31.640 --> 01:26:32.140]
Remember that?

[01:26:32.140 --> 01:26:32.900]
No, you haven't seen it.

[01:26:32.940 --> 01:26:33.400]
You haven't seen it.

[01:26:33.420 --> 01:26:34.200]
He's saying he's seen it.

[01:26:34.200 --> 01:26:35.820]
Oh, yeah, how he is.

[01:26:36.180 --> 01:26:37.040]
Oh, man.

[01:26:38.060 --> 01:26:38.460]
Wow.

[01:26:38.560 --> 01:26:40.620]
They're reimbursed for back pain.

[01:26:41.420 --> 01:26:44.160]
I have a feeling we could probably play this.

[01:26:44.580 --> 01:26:46.300]
What do you think?

[01:26:46.720 --> 01:26:46.900]
No.

[01:26:47.160 --> 01:26:48.420]
Right up to the chorus.

[01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:49.440]
Oh, I see.

[01:26:50.060 --> 01:26:52.300]
No, I was saying if I use a quick finger, what do you think?

[01:26:52.420 --> 01:26:52.520]
No.

[01:26:54.160 --> 01:26:55.340]
Now, wait, what do you mean?

[01:26:55.340 --> 01:26:56.320]
You just say, Chris, did he say no?

[01:26:57.640 --> 01:26:59.840]
They're reimbursed for back pain.

[01:27:00.740 --> 01:27:05.300]
About 200 years ago, when they were late.

[01:27:05.880 --> 01:27:08.060]
I'll be hungry if you do.

[01:27:09.220 --> 01:27:10.420]
I'll be hungry if you do.

[01:27:10.420 --> 01:27:13.700]
I'll be hungry if you do.

[01:27:13.700 --> 01:27:14.080]
Yeah.

[01:27:14.820 --> 01:27:16.220]
Oh, wait a minute.

[01:27:16.220 --> 01:27:17.500]
I almost fell straight down.

[01:27:20.520 --> 01:27:22.460]
Oh, my objects.

[01:27:23.220 --> 01:27:23.360]
Yeah.

[01:27:24.040 --> 01:27:24.620]
Okay.

[01:27:25.120 --> 01:27:27.300]
I only have a hole, hole.

[01:27:27.600 --> 01:27:29.320]
I don't remember how this is.

[01:27:29.320 --> 01:27:29.540]
I did.

[01:27:31.160 --> 01:27:31.900]
How this goes?

[01:27:33.060 --> 01:27:33.760]
I am pissed.

[01:27:35.200 --> 01:27:35.600]
You're stuck.

[01:27:35.980 --> 01:27:35.980]

[01:27:36.180 --> 01:27:36.480]
Right now.

[01:27:36.760 --> 01:27:37.160]
Found it.

[01:27:37.460 --> 01:27:37.580]
Found it.

[01:27:37.680 --> 01:27:37.820]
Found it.

[01:27:38.300 --> 01:27:38.860]
Found it.

[01:27:38.940 --> 01:27:39.020]
Yeah.

[01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:40.140]
Come on now.

[01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:40.540]
Good job.

[01:27:41.080 --> 01:27:41.600]
That was great.

[01:27:41.960 --> 01:27:42.720]
You can play two more now.

[01:27:43.060 --> 01:27:43.060]

[01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:44.160]
You can play three more words.

[01:27:46.660 --> 01:27:47.500]
Four more words.

[01:27:47.520 --> 01:27:48.040]
Got it.

[01:27:48.620 --> 01:27:49.240]
One more.

[01:27:49.500 --> 01:27:49.740]
One more.

[01:27:49.960 --> 01:27:50.500]
One more word.

[01:27:52.100 --> 01:27:52.920]
One more word.

[01:27:55.020 --> 01:27:55.780]
No chance.

[01:27:57.160 --> 01:27:58.900]
No, I'm getting that baby out of here.

[01:28:17.580 --> 01:28:18.100]
That's a bad machine, man.

[01:28:18.100 --> 01:28:18.100]

[01:28:18.100 --> 01:28:19.600]
That's a bad machine, man.

[01:28:20.820 --> 01:28:22.480]
That's a bad machine, man.

[01:28:23.320 --> 01:28:24.140]
That's a bad machine, man.

[01:28:24.200 --> 01:28:24.280]
That's a bad machine, man.

[01:28:24.280 --> 01:28:24.480]
That's a bad machine, man.

[01:28:24.480 --> 01:28:24.480]

[01:28:24.480 --> 01:28:24.480]

[01:28:24.480 --> 01:28:24.500]
That's a bad machine, man.

[01:28:24.500 --> 01:28:24.500]

[01:28:24.500 --> 01:28:24.500]

[01:28:24.500 --> 01:28:24.500]

[01:28:24.500 --> 01:28:24.500]

[01:28:24.500 --> 01:28:24.500]

[01:28:24.500 --> 01:28:24.500]

[01:28:24.500 --> 01:28:24.500]

[01:28:24.500 --> 01:28:24.500]

[01:28:24.500 --> 01:28:24.860]
That's a bad machine, man.

[01:28:25.240 --> 01:28:25.620]
That's a bad machine, man.

[01:28:25.620 --> 01:28:26.040]
That's a bad machine, man.

[01:28:26.880 --> 01:28:28.000]
That's a bad machine, man.

[01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.860]
We're kicking some serious fat or ass ancient style today.

[01:28:31.140 --> 01:28:31.880]
Let me tell you that.

[01:28:32.040 --> 01:28:33.760]
That kind of rejuvenated me here in time again.

[01:28:34.560 --> 01:28:34.960]
Yeah.

[01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:36.520]
You don't think you could clean that up?

[01:28:37.400 --> 01:28:41.000]
I think the message would stay there no matter how many bleeps we put in it.

[01:28:42.180 --> 01:28:44.780]
I think somebody would feel this is a really hard time.

[01:28:45.480 --> 01:28:45.600]
Oh.

[01:28:46.620 --> 01:28:47.780]
Not to mention any choice.

[01:28:48.620 --> 01:28:49.200]
Oh, it's choice.

[01:28:49.380 --> 01:28:50.340]
Forget about that bitch.

[01:28:50.980 --> 01:28:51.520]
I'd like to.

[01:28:51.640 --> 01:28:51.640]

[01:28:51.720 --> 01:28:52.060]
I'd like to.

[01:28:52.080 --> 01:28:52.080]

[01:28:52.240 --> 01:28:53.900]
What a nauseating thought that is.

[01:28:53.940 --> 01:28:54.140]
Oh.

[01:28:54.580 --> 01:28:55.460]
Even more obscene.

[01:28:55.460 --> 01:28:56.560]
And that's the first cut on that.

[01:28:56.640 --> 01:28:58.500]
Now, let's do probably some other good stuff on there.

[01:28:58.620 --> 01:28:59.040]
Oh, I know.

[01:28:59.180 --> 01:28:59.740]
I know there is.

[01:29:00.600 --> 01:29:01.420]
Coach Jim Morris.

[01:29:01.960 --> 01:29:02.180]
Hmm.

[01:29:02.580 --> 01:29:03.520]
I don't know what hell that means.

[01:29:04.860 --> 01:29:05.920]
I mean, I know who he was.

[01:29:06.260 --> 01:29:07.340]
Is this thing ever going to queue up?

[01:29:07.420 --> 01:29:09.200]
I think the machine is rejecting the disc.

[01:29:10.120 --> 01:29:12.100]
It says, sir, ho on, but it's just not.

[01:29:12.220 --> 01:29:12.960]
It's not queuing up.

[01:29:14.100 --> 01:29:16.820]
I think Joyce is the fiddle with my top deck here.

[01:29:17.180 --> 01:29:17.460]
Let's see.

[01:29:17.540 --> 01:29:18.300]
What's going on, man?

[01:29:19.240 --> 01:29:20.560]
There's some drag in my deck.

[01:29:21.660 --> 01:29:22.340]
Sir, ho on.

[01:29:22.420 --> 01:29:23.840]
If you'd have the first time, thank God,

[01:29:23.840 --> 01:29:26.180]
because that was a really, that was a lot of fun.

[01:29:26.300 --> 01:29:27.760]
I brought back some really bad memories.

[01:29:28.560 --> 01:29:29.680]
The other one is not here, though.

[01:29:29.820 --> 01:29:31.360]
Con, delisa, it's not on here.

[01:29:32.520 --> 01:29:33.840]
It just says, sir, ho on.

[01:29:33.940 --> 01:29:34.720]
What's that all about?

[01:29:35.040 --> 01:29:35.280]
I don't know.

[01:29:37.400 --> 01:29:39.320]
It just is rejecting it.

[01:29:39.460 --> 01:29:39.880]
It's not reading.

[01:29:40.920 --> 01:29:41.260]
What do you mean?

[01:29:41.420 --> 01:29:42.340]
It doesn't even get that far.

[01:29:42.420 --> 01:29:44.380]
It doesn't even say a table of contents here.

[01:29:44.480 --> 01:29:45.400]
It just says, sir, ho on.

[01:29:45.700 --> 01:29:46.580]
Well, I'll be danged.

[01:29:46.600 --> 01:29:47.920]
OK, take that baby out of there.

[01:29:48.460 --> 01:29:49.740]
Probably a message from the Lord.

[01:29:49.980 --> 01:29:50.260]
You know what?

[01:29:50.280 --> 01:29:50.920]
Damn, God!

[01:29:51.300 --> 01:29:52.360]
Give me some real good advice.

[01:29:52.360 --> 01:29:53.280]
Don't be doing that, now.

[01:29:53.380 --> 01:29:54.520]
It'll be messing with that thing again.

[01:29:55.020 --> 01:29:57.060]
OK, I want to put it over here for tomorrow.

[01:29:57.840 --> 01:29:58.520]
WQAM, hello.

[01:29:58.760 --> 01:30:00.040]
Good afternoon, sir.

[01:30:00.300 --> 01:30:00.680]
Yes, sir.

[01:30:01.140 --> 01:30:06.200]
You have this office yelling and screaming and rolling in stitches,

[01:30:06.420 --> 01:30:07.800]
hoping for the old days, man.

[01:30:08.080 --> 01:30:09.460]
Oh, yeah, don't we all.

[01:30:10.240 --> 01:30:12.560]
Oh, man, people are like, I can't believe it.

[01:30:12.940 --> 01:30:14.640]
I'm going to put it in the back.

[01:30:15.800 --> 01:30:18.400]
You got to admit, I got to write up to the hook there.

[01:30:18.660 --> 01:30:22.320]
I'll tell you what, everybody here has done Google searches.

[01:30:23.700 --> 01:30:24.640]
Good luck to you.

[01:30:24.880 --> 01:30:25.900]
People lucked to you.

[01:30:26.100 --> 01:30:27.540]
Trying to find that.

[01:30:27.640 --> 01:30:27.720]
Yeah.

[01:30:28.160 --> 01:30:28.960]
We'll buy you.

[01:30:29.320 --> 01:30:33.820]
But, no, can't do it because, you know, the right wing and the other wing.

[01:30:33.900 --> 01:30:37.820]
The PC Goop balls out there just, they kind of feather us.

[01:30:37.980 --> 01:30:41.040]
But thank you very much for the memories in your memory.

[01:30:41.040 --> 01:30:41.480]
You're welcome.

[01:30:41.900 --> 01:30:42.360]
I appreciate it.

[01:30:42.620 --> 01:30:43.220]
Ostechier me.

[01:30:43.220 --> 01:30:43.620]
Bye-bye.

[01:30:43.900 --> 01:30:44.220]
See it.

[01:30:45.360 --> 01:30:46.480]
See, he enjoyed it.

[01:30:47.200 --> 01:30:50.160]
He's one of those people who remembers the whole office is just for me.

[01:30:50.160 --> 01:30:53.780]
They remember when we used to have fun on a show and on this radio station before the FCC.

[01:30:54.200 --> 01:30:56.300]
And we can thank Janet Jackson and Justin Tinkerbell.

[01:30:56.380 --> 01:30:56.800]
Hey, Justin.

[01:30:56.880 --> 01:30:57.240]
You're fair.

[01:30:57.280 --> 01:31:03.160]
Who phony little pork man makes me want to puke my guts out and Janet Jackson with her crap.

[01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:05.380]
This isn't even in the other machine.

[01:31:05.580 --> 01:31:06.320]
This isn't the thing.

[01:31:07.360 --> 01:31:08.300]
Oh, wait a minute it is.

[01:31:08.800 --> 01:31:09.500]
Oh, no.

[01:31:10.060 --> 01:31:11.260]
No, I don't want to put it there again.

[01:31:11.740 --> 01:31:12.540]
Now, what else is on here?

[01:31:12.600 --> 01:31:13.480]
The Gildi Show theme?

[01:31:13.920 --> 01:31:14.280]
I don't know.

[01:31:14.560 --> 01:31:15.440]
Kind of leaves it on the giant.

[01:31:17.760 --> 01:31:20.220]
Gildi Show, Gildi Show.

[01:31:20.440 --> 01:31:21.280]
Forget about it, promo.

[01:31:21.500 --> 01:31:23.700]
Maybe there's stuff on here that isn't in the promo for the homo.

[01:31:23.740 --> 01:31:24.660]
But God about it.

[01:31:24.960 --> 01:31:25.980]
That's what I say.

[01:31:26.300 --> 01:31:28.120]
How's that for a funny show idea?

[01:31:28.660 --> 01:31:31.120]
If I made borrow a phrase from the great Marty Allen.

[01:31:31.520 --> 01:31:32.140]
Hello, Dare.

[01:31:32.480 --> 01:31:34.120]
Everybody in Paradise Land.

[01:31:34.680 --> 01:31:37.780]
And then of course there's always the much beloved mogus rate.

[01:31:38.040 --> 01:31:38.880]
See it about our house.

[01:31:39.060 --> 01:31:40.120]
Oh, I don't think we can play that.

[01:31:41.440 --> 01:31:42.800]
And how about your fire dizziness?

[01:31:42.880 --> 01:31:43.960]
It's the correct they played down the hole.

[01:31:43.960 --> 01:31:45.600]
That's power 96.

[01:31:45.720 --> 01:31:46.520]
You're a garbage.

[01:31:46.880 --> 01:31:48.280]
The kids don't know what's good.

[01:31:48.520 --> 01:31:51.640]
Like that song, I'm happy I live in a split level head.

[01:31:51.840 --> 01:31:52.840]
You remember that?

[01:31:53.640 --> 01:31:54.960]
How can you listen?

[01:31:56.240 --> 01:31:58.180]
I'm happier I live in a split level head.

[01:31:58.460 --> 01:32:00.220]
I'm happier I live in a split level head.

[01:32:00.520 --> 01:32:01.820]
You remember that?

[01:32:01.960 --> 01:32:02.120]
No.

[01:32:02.940 --> 01:32:04.800]
Why are my friends and my morons?

[01:32:05.100 --> 01:32:05.940]
Come on, how we?

[01:32:06.240 --> 01:32:08.500]
Don't you go be how we?

[01:32:09.160 --> 01:32:11.300]
There's nothing to put in action from you, pal.

[01:32:13.300 --> 01:32:14.800]
You shut up, asshole.

[01:32:15.400 --> 01:32:16.480]
Okay, that's it.

[01:32:16.740 --> 01:32:17.660]
You're all fired.

[01:32:19.220 --> 01:32:21.320]
You can't stoop in the open.

[01:32:22.360 --> 01:32:23.360]
You listen to me.

[01:32:23.840 --> 01:32:24.320]
You're a fired.

[01:32:24.720 --> 01:32:25.580]
Oh, do do do do do do do.

[01:32:25.720 --> 01:32:27.560]
I'll take that ghost for you too.

[01:32:28.840 --> 01:32:30.100]
You know who I am.

[01:32:30.380 --> 01:32:31.940]
I'm the king of Paradise.

[01:32:37.020 --> 01:32:41.000]
I came down here after losing my charm.

[01:32:41.840 --> 01:32:43.860]
To be a big fish.

[01:32:44.240 --> 01:32:45.940]
In a little pond.

[01:32:46.700 --> 01:32:52.080]
When they kicked me off the SP and they told me don't come back again.

[01:32:52.640 --> 01:32:56.600]
I had some problems with why these guys who advised I move to Paradise.

[01:32:57.320 --> 01:32:59.820]
Oh, yeah.

[01:33:01.060 --> 01:33:01.460]
Fire!

[01:33:02.960 --> 01:33:04.960]
That fish nearly flew away nine.

[01:33:06.300 --> 01:33:07.140]
I got one fucking.

[01:33:07.560 --> 01:33:08.460]
You're all fired.

[01:33:08.980 --> 01:33:11.320]
I hope that just goes one dice.

[01:33:12.260 --> 01:33:13.380]
Well, I hope you're happy.

[01:33:13.620 --> 01:33:14.660]
I hope you die.

[01:33:15.120 --> 01:33:16.360]
I hope you all die.

[01:33:16.940 --> 01:33:19.040]
I'm a big fish in a little pond to see you.

[01:33:19.280 --> 01:33:20.360]
A big fish in a little pond.

[01:33:20.860 --> 01:33:22.060]
Did anybody else hear you, babe?

[01:33:22.660 --> 01:33:23.800]
I'm a big fish in a little pond.

[01:33:23.960 --> 01:33:24.840]
A big fish in a little pond.

[01:33:24.980 --> 01:33:25.340]
A big fish in a little pond.

[01:33:25.340 --> 01:33:25.940]
A big fish in a little pond.

[01:33:26.320 --> 01:33:26.640]
Yeah!

[01:33:27.960 --> 01:33:29.640]
What a time are you enjoying it?

[01:33:30.040 --> 01:33:31.900]
Now, now, come down, Howard.

[01:33:32.160 --> 01:33:34.900]
What do you say we go have some nice sushi?

[01:33:34.900 --> 01:33:36.120]
Don't talk, don't talk.

[01:33:37.660 --> 01:33:39.340]
Yeah, there had to be one dump in there.

[01:33:39.420 --> 01:33:40.000]
I knew that.

[01:33:40.600 --> 01:33:41.740]
Just before Gus went.

[01:33:43.360 --> 01:33:44.360]
Maybe he said jazz.

[01:33:44.560 --> 01:33:46.100]
Maybe he was listening as well as 94.

[01:33:46.620 --> 01:33:48.380]
Hey, Walnose to find the way.

[01:33:48.600 --> 01:33:49.640]
Let's just play that all day.

[01:33:49.740 --> 01:33:50.260]
Just the intro.

[01:33:50.400 --> 01:33:50.720]
What are you saying?

[01:33:50.900 --> 01:33:51.500]
Yeah, I never know.

[01:33:51.680 --> 01:33:52.880]
There's a lot of reverb on it.

[01:33:52.980 --> 01:33:53.320]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:33:54.280 --> 01:33:58.260]
The vocal blind's production value has surpassed anything anywhere that anyone else is doing.

[01:33:59.480 --> 01:34:00.220]
He'd be the best.

[01:34:00.540 --> 01:34:02.220]
Hey, Walnose to find the way.

[01:34:02.220 --> 01:34:06.120]
Somebody called WAB Sirium, bursting for back pain.

[01:34:07.060 --> 01:34:11.540]
From 200 years ago, when they were slaves.

[01:34:12.720 --> 01:34:13.420]
Oh, alright.

[01:34:14.360 --> 01:34:16.660]
Well, I only have a mobile home.

[01:34:18.180 --> 01:34:20.260]
A pitful and a pinch of skull.

[01:34:21.180 --> 01:34:25.600]
So if you wanna ask me how, here's what I gotta say.

[01:34:26.560 --> 01:34:26.960]
Alright.

[01:34:27.680 --> 01:34:28.920]
You've got to.

[01:34:29.780 --> 01:34:30.940]
Okay, 10 pass noon.

[01:34:34.360 --> 01:34:34.780]
Doesn't it?

[01:34:34.780 --> 01:34:37.520]
That guy was, they were doing cartwheels in the office.

[01:34:37.700 --> 01:34:38.400]
He said, I believe in.

[01:34:38.440 --> 01:34:39.560]
All they know was, I'm sure.

[01:34:39.660 --> 01:34:40.800]
He was doing cartwheels in my pants.

[01:34:41.180 --> 01:34:43.680]
In an honor of a Void Blind Tuesday, got my pants on and my shirt.

[01:34:44.120 --> 01:34:45.720]
That makes me feel better that you got your pants on.

[01:34:46.240 --> 01:34:46.680]
Why is that?

[01:34:46.820 --> 01:34:47.240]
And your shirt.

[01:34:47.600 --> 01:34:48.060]
More secure?

[01:34:49.140 --> 01:34:49.780]
Yeah, exactly.

[01:34:50.080 --> 01:34:52.680]
Even though you're a Serrano, you know, pantsless fags make us all nervous.

[01:34:53.140 --> 01:34:54.220]
No, well, there's a lot of them.

[01:34:54.720 --> 01:34:56.940]
202 on this new pool, that means we got over 1200 votes.

[01:34:56.940 --> 01:34:58.680]
But we're gonna get over whatever we get.

[01:34:58.960 --> 01:35:00.120]
We get a big total.

[01:35:00.400 --> 01:35:00.900]
Because we're cheating.

[01:35:01.100 --> 01:35:02.460]
We're doing two polls for the price of one.

[01:35:02.540 --> 01:35:03.740]
And you don't have to change the pool today.

[01:35:04.260 --> 01:35:04.520]
Excellent.

[01:35:04.800 --> 01:35:07.200]
You can go take a nice nap and go into a coma.

[01:35:08.480 --> 01:35:12.460]
I'm the owner of an overactive craving for food is moving into lead now 42.

[01:35:12.920 --> 01:35:14.820]
And that's because we were talking about the food, I guess.

[01:35:16.140 --> 01:35:16.960]
Craving for food.

[01:35:17.380 --> 01:35:19.000]
Sex drive 38 is sliding.

[01:35:19.480 --> 01:35:20.020]
There's sliding.

[01:35:20.140 --> 01:35:21.540]
It's up and it's sliding it, but not enough.

[01:35:22.720 --> 01:35:23.940]
Nothing overactive with me 28.

[01:35:24.080 --> 01:35:28.340]
Yeah, fart maker 26, bladder 20, 20.

[01:35:28.960 --> 01:35:31.480]
Imagination 14, overactive bottles 10.

[01:35:32.580 --> 01:35:38.360]
Mental disorder 5, sweat glands 4, paranoia 4, nervous system 4, thirst 3.

[01:35:38.960 --> 01:35:43.900]
Impulsive car video talk shows with nothing to say 3, hypokonnia 1 and thyroid has got.

[01:35:44.700 --> 01:35:45.300]
Oh!

[01:35:45.460 --> 01:35:45.560]
None.

[01:35:46.780 --> 01:35:51.660]
I guess that excuse went out with the mickers and hypotenissues that will always have an overactive thyroid.

[01:35:51.660 --> 01:35:57.240]
That's why we ate 145 pounds and I keep shoveling crap down my push constantly all day long.

[01:35:57.240 --> 01:35:57.840]
Am I right?

[01:35:58.140 --> 01:35:58.280]
Yep.

[01:35:58.380 --> 01:35:59.980]
They used to be the excuse to be jury.

[01:36:00.180 --> 01:36:00.360]
Sure.

[01:36:01.800 --> 01:36:04.560]
12 minutes past noon at 5.60 W.A.M.

[01:36:05.020 --> 01:36:06.700]
Now let's see, do I cue that back or what?

[01:36:08.160 --> 01:36:08.560]
Yeah.

[01:36:10.160 --> 01:36:10.560]
Yeah.

[01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:12.560]
I thought I could have put it on pause, you know.

[01:36:12.660 --> 01:36:13.240]
I took my hand.

[01:36:13.240 --> 01:36:13.240]

[01:36:13.440 --> 01:36:13.860]
My hand.

[01:36:15.240 --> 01:36:15.640]
New.

[01:36:16.660 --> 01:36:17.020]
Yeah.

[01:36:22.660 --> 01:36:23.920]
More.

[01:36:23.920 --> 01:36:24.200]
More Higher.

[01:36:26.660 --> 01:36:27.040]
More.

[01:36:36.020 --> 01:36:36.960]
More.

[01:36:39.200 --> 01:36:39.360]
More.

[01:36:39.360 --> 01:36:39.360]

[01:36:39.360 --> 01:36:39.360]

[01:36:47.640 --> 01:36:49.120]
More.

Goldie of a conflict of interest a bank committee

[01:39:35.600 --> 01:39:39.920]
probably right but it is findings that he was building of a conflict of interest and ranging for a pay raise and

[01:39:39.920 --> 01:39:46.660]
Promotion in 2005 to Shah Ali Risa his companion wrote Steve and vice-man in the at times like yesterday afternoon

[01:39:48.040 --> 01:39:51.840]
There wasn't clear whether the committee consisting of seven of the banks 24 board members who the

[01:39:51.840 --> 01:39:58.360]
Remove Mr. Wolfowitz from his poster more likely express lots of cost loss of confidence in his leadership and manner that my persuade him to resign

[01:39:59.820 --> 01:40:05.220]
The news game is wolfowitz advisor Kevin Kellams resigned complaining that the cloud over the Bush appointed president

[01:40:05.220 --> 01:40:11.100]
Made his work at the institution useless the satirical website one kit was also reporting rumors like yesterday

[01:40:11.100 --> 01:40:15.820]
The wolfowitz resigned that the site was unable to back to the more but a beep bit of whoop and I don't see no more on that

[01:40:15.820 --> 01:40:19.420]

We do have this and you are a very important part of this all of us in the DCS

[01:42:42.860 --> 01:42:49.520]
But oh yeah, yeah, it's worth playing the column on this bit. That's right. It's my idea, too. What's it really? Yeah

That's funny what I'm not gonna say what's funny. I can do what I want because the management loves me

[01:44:33.880 --> 01:44:38.100]
In a place of no something ought to know but along his time I want to do to be my

[01:44:38.100 --> 01:44:40.500]
Oh, who I might type out now. I'm afraid. Oh, no

[01:44:41.200 --> 01:44:43.260]
What do you do? I don't take no for an answer

[01:44:44.440 --> 01:44:45.160]

[01:44:59.220 --> 01:45:04.960]
Miss Peterson. Yes, I just Bob Williams down at sores Bob's boss. Oh, how are you? How are you today? Fine?

[01:45:05.760 --> 01:45:11.060]
Are you sitting down? Yes, I'm afraid I have some bad news for you. What do you mean dad?

[01:45:12.960 --> 01:45:16.460]
I understand that Bob's been with us for almost 20 years now and that's okay

[01:45:16.460 --> 01:45:21.920]
Is me oh Bob's fine a little upset but fine. He's been a good worker for us

[01:45:21.920 --> 01:45:24.400]
He's made all his quotas his bonuses of always been in line

[01:45:25.140 --> 01:45:27.140]
But we're gonna have to let him go

[01:45:28.520 --> 01:45:30.820]
We're gonna have to fire him and

[01:45:30.820 --> 01:45:34.820]
Unfortunately being the boss sometimes you have to do things that you're not very pleased doing

[01:45:34.820 --> 01:45:36.380]
So that's not very fair

[01:45:37.320 --> 01:45:41.000]
He's been very loyal to you. Yes, he has that's like a slap in the face

[01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:46.800]
Um, I can imagine you failing that way absolutely, but feeling that way you don't understand

[01:45:46.800 --> 01:45:49.160]
We just had a baby. Yes, I understand

[01:45:49.160 --> 01:45:54.160]
Build up the Yin Yang understood this is a very hard time to do this kind of a thing

[01:45:54.160 --> 01:45:58.840]
I I fully agree with you, but there's something has happened down here at the office that that we can't overlook

[01:45:58.840 --> 01:46:02.840]
It's an it's an image problem and a problem that you might want to address yourself

[01:46:03.820 --> 01:46:07.500]
Um, I don't look quite how to tell you though. Why are you firing him?

[01:46:11.940 --> 01:46:13.920]
It's a little delicate unfortunately

[01:46:13.920 --> 01:46:16.580]
We found him on top of his desk making love to his secretary

[01:46:16.580 --> 01:46:21.320]
Oh about son of a bitch. Well, I can understand you're being upset at this point, but

[01:46:25.740 --> 01:46:27.620]
Well, um, he's gonna need your support

[01:46:29.520 --> 01:46:31.620]
Right now he's on his way home to you and he

[01:46:31.620 --> 01:46:37.040]
Got another thing coming when he gets home. I'm gonna change the locks on the door

[01:46:37.040 --> 01:46:40.500]
I'm so excited on the front one. He can just have it all

[01:46:40.980 --> 01:46:42.980]
I'm not even gonna be here when he gets back

[01:46:42.980 --> 01:46:46.780]
That's not about that and now now I don't feel so bad about

[01:46:48.320 --> 01:46:48.680]
Well

[01:46:48.680 --> 01:46:51.760]
12.30 to 5.60

[01:46:52.420 --> 01:46:57.600]
Pretty QA you know the thing you'll be very pleased about is I'm sending this disc away as a gift now

[01:46:57.600 --> 01:46:59.660]
You didn't put this in that package yourself. Did you?

[01:47:00.940 --> 01:47:05.740]
No, well, this this one is going. I don't have it. I do okay. Well, I do at the moment

[01:47:05.740 --> 01:47:08.700]
I'm mailing it away then I won't ever be tempted to play

[01:47:08.700 --> 01:47:12.340]
No, if you mail it down here, I'll make copies and send them to you. I don't know everybody

[01:47:12.340 --> 01:47:15.540]
Where you yeah, you promise of course

[01:47:16.580 --> 01:47:20.140]
So you don't have this I don't think so. I mean, I might be somewhere in the studio

[01:47:20.140 --> 01:47:25.400]
You know buried very deep somewhere, but I don't right. I don't know. I'm gonna. I'll choke up about it

[01:47:25.400 --> 01:47:28.820]
Okay, I'll send it to you and I make copies and send it to the appropriate parties

[01:47:28.820 --> 01:47:34.620]
You got party talk you got it. You know, I'm talking about just okay great. Okay. They'll go over here in my pile

[01:47:34.620 --> 01:47:38.980]
I got news for it as a collector's item. That's not one lot of people are gonna be holding on to I mean it haven't

[01:47:39.600 --> 01:47:42.180]

[01:47:56.800 --> 01:48:00.000]
We don't want to mention too much, you know, because then you get all bent out of shape

[01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:03.880]
Oh, all he's talking about is that kids and about MySpace, you know, you start with that crap

[01:48:04.640 --> 01:48:06.640]
Didn't he start with that crap? Sure. Yeah

[01:48:08.080 --> 01:48:10.440]
So that means we got 1257 all together

[01:48:11.900 --> 01:48:14.200]

Huh and and I'll good afternoon is that kiss a listener good morning. He's like that's a great idea. I just had

[01:49:52.860 --> 01:49:54.220]

[01:50:00.260 --> 01:50:06.920]
WQ way you way am hello. Hey Leo how you doing? Okay sir. I am the owner of an overactive bladder

[01:50:07.560 --> 01:50:07.960]
Yeah

[01:50:08.760 --> 01:50:14.760]
That was just what I wanted to tell you now you haven't seen the those commercials on tv for if you're going and going and going and going

[01:50:14.760 --> 01:50:18.720]
That there I'm like every five minutes on the news. You know I'm trying most everything it doesn't help

[01:50:19.120 --> 01:50:22.360]
I can get out of bed. How about a little bag

[01:50:23.380 --> 01:50:25.240]
I might enjoy that you have one

[01:50:26.060 --> 01:50:30.700]
Now Mo may have left his behind. Looks like the studio for it and maybe it's got a long tube

[01:50:31.580 --> 01:50:36.000]
I see I shouldn't make light of that because people have to wear a bag. I mean, oh, can you even imagine that?

[01:50:36.500 --> 01:50:37.940]
No, I can't

[01:50:37.940 --> 01:50:42.380]
Which reminds me I shouldn't speak ill of the dead but my close-good friend fat rich the duly departed

[01:50:42.380 --> 01:50:47.160]
He he had a couple of incidents cross when you wait like eight thousand pounds like which you did it just you know

[01:50:47.160 --> 01:50:48.940]
It's not conducive to good health

[01:50:49.760 --> 01:50:54.880]
And there were a couple of times when he was wearing one I think one time he admitted it and another time

[01:50:54.880 --> 01:50:59.060]
He didn't but he didn't have to tell me and I'm saying no I don't want to get too graphic. It's a middle of lunch time

[01:50:59.060 --> 01:51:04.580]
But oh you know I'm talking about no no no don't I won't I won't drug diaphragm for you good

[01:51:04.580 --> 01:51:09.560]

[01:51:10.540 --> 01:51:11.200]
The radiation

[01:51:12.280 --> 01:51:15.460]
I'm doing what to you talking about the queen and her activities

[01:51:19.400 --> 01:51:21.620]
What are you talking about what are you talking about?

[01:51:22.300 --> 01:51:23.020]
Somebody QA

[01:51:23.020 --> 01:51:24.360]
Hey, and hello

[01:51:24.360 --> 01:51:30.980]
Free thanks. Yes, uh-huh. They're like it was by number two that clown that heard that paid manning bit was on the Bob and Tom show

[01:51:30.980 --> 01:51:33.500]
Oh Bob and Tom show and not on this show

[01:51:33.500 --> 01:51:37.260]
Now come on where you get with it for cross-days

[01:51:37.260 --> 01:51:39.680]
Yeah, we're same thing we're gonna do with you, okay

[01:51:40.960 --> 01:51:46.300]
Come on, I already get with it. It's confusing us with Bob and Tom see Bob and Tom can probably still play some pretty funny stuff

[01:51:46.300 --> 01:51:52.140]
They don't have joy seconds in with it fact. We have some good Bob and Tom bits. We can't play anymore either for example

[01:51:53.020 --> 01:51:57.860]
Hi, Felicia. G. I love your dress and your hair looks so shiny and manageable

[01:51:57.860 --> 01:52:00.700]
Are you still shampooing with head and shoulders?

[01:52:03.060 --> 01:52:06.560]
That's one of my very favorites too bad we can't play that either in fact that may have been the thing

[01:52:06.560 --> 01:52:10.680]
Maybe we'll do that tomorrow. We'll play a little bit of all the bits we can't play in fact

[01:52:10.680 --> 01:52:14.540]
We can do that the rest of the year. That's how long that would take let's play just a little bit

[01:52:15.060 --> 01:52:19.300]
Listen to me. It's just stand by and steam for sofa thing. Yeah, see that we can't play that

[01:52:19.960 --> 01:52:24.540]
We can say that though right right like we once had a sponsor recalled so far

[01:52:26.060 --> 01:52:26.780]
Place king

[01:52:27.340 --> 01:52:31.160]
We have to leave like a long call and how many so we did I did so I think they still out there too

That uh Aikman bit you started to play earlier. Can you now play that whole thing either now? Oh sure

[01:53:07.420 --> 01:53:09.480]
Oh, is this a request?

[01:53:11.640 --> 01:53:14.300]
Is this this let me say again. Is this a request?

[01:53:15.940 --> 01:53:16.580]
I'd be comment

[01:53:17.460 --> 01:53:19.300]
You don't want to hear it

[01:53:19.720 --> 01:53:22.620]
I'd love to hear the whole thing. Well, I'm gonna play it a minute. Jesus come

[01:53:22.940 --> 01:53:28.380]
You know you try to do something nice. There's nothing worse than some of you try to do something nice try to be agreeable and uh

[01:53:28.940 --> 01:53:31.460]
You know like whatever he was saying. What was he saying? I don't know

[01:53:31.460 --> 01:53:32.640]
I don't know

[01:53:32.640 --> 01:53:33.520]
You know what I'm saying? No

[01:53:33.520 --> 01:53:38.220]
Now what were you talking about the queen? What are you babbling about? What is it that I'm doing to you about the queen?

[01:53:38.220 --> 01:53:41.000]
I thought you were about to talk about her bathroom business

[01:53:42.420 --> 01:53:46.140]
Why is somebody saying that's an example? That's what I thought that's where I thought you were going

[01:53:46.140 --> 01:53:50.280]
Well, so what their vizzeria make? It's oh, well, I guess it's a royal flush

[01:53:51.840 --> 01:53:52.240]
Oh

[01:53:53.140 --> 01:54:00.620]
Royal flush we wouldn't have a bit by that name. Would we? And now a royal flush. I don't think we can play it. Oh no, we can't

[01:54:00.620 --> 01:54:00.980]
Ha?

[01:54:02.960 --> 01:54:05.760]
That's another guy I'm so glad you said

[01:54:05.760 --> 01:54:10.640]
You some old

[01:54:17.340 --> 01:54:18.340]
Oh

[01:54:22.860 --> 01:54:24.680]
My junior honey

[01:54:28.020 --> 01:54:29.840]
Oh my god

[01:54:34.840 --> 01:54:43.440]
Oh, when the squad of back gets lonely, you ferret he likes, receive his dinner, why?

[01:54:46.240 --> 01:54:54.020]
Some people say that number eight is gay, they say Troy loves the big brown eyes.

[01:54:54.020 --> 01:54:54.520]
Backdome!

[01:54:58.020 --> 01:55:00.880]
He goes down on his knees, Eggman.

[01:55:01.420 --> 01:55:02.020]
Absolute.

[01:55:03.080 --> 01:55:06.040]
His eyes he likes, but please Eggman.

[01:55:07.060 --> 01:55:11.260]
He loves to snap cowboys on their behind.

[01:55:11.920 --> 01:55:12.840]
Backdome!

[01:55:16.420 --> 01:55:19.160]
He's got a spotless reputation.

[01:55:19.160 --> 01:55:23.920]
He's got a good name, a good name, a good name, a good name, a good name, a good name.

[01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:27.920]
But is Troy gay?

[01:55:28.440 --> 01:55:34.420]
I've heard some people say that in the Hubble, he goes down.

[01:55:34.580 --> 01:55:36.360]
Oh, Eggman.

[01:55:37.520 --> 01:55:41.540]
You ferret he goes down on his knees, Eggman.

[01:55:42.980 --> 01:55:46.440]
I can't some balls to squeeze, Eggman.

[01:55:48.500 --> 01:55:54.400]
Don't let him cause he likes it from behind.

[01:55:55.680 --> 01:55:56.040]
Backdome!

[01:55:56.340 --> 01:56:00.160]
I'll say one thing about Troy's boy, they just hooked him up with some blonde broad.

[01:56:00.320 --> 01:56:02.000]
Is the Avermerie him off or something Chris?

[01:56:03.360 --> 01:56:04.480]
I do believe he got married.

[01:56:04.820 --> 01:56:06.040]
I think they did, they married him off.

[01:56:06.220 --> 01:56:09.780]
Because it was a start and a look man, people started talking to him, it was all about commercial endorsements.

[01:56:10.060 --> 01:56:13.660]
And they take you off the NFL pre-game show and a post-game show and all that other stuff.

[01:56:14.140 --> 01:56:20.060]
I'll tell you one other thing about him, we never have any pictures of him with his hand on some young man's crotch like Brady Quinn.

[01:56:21.240 --> 01:56:25.420]
I just mentioned that in passing, that picture, the more you look at it, the more you wonder.

[01:56:25.600 --> 01:56:27.980]
I mean, you know guys like to have goof around and etc.

[01:56:28.340 --> 01:56:29.380]
You know, you're just jealous.

[01:56:30.720 --> 01:56:30.720]

[01:56:31.180 --> 01:56:31.860]
That's not your hand.

[01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:37.640]
On Brady Quinn's crotch?

[01:56:37.880 --> 01:56:38.060]
Yes.

[01:56:38.940 --> 01:56:39.380]
You're right.

[01:56:41.380 --> 01:56:48.680]
1247 at a QA, I'm a Texas Republican Congressman in Volta founding Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan in a floor speech, he delivered yesterday in support of the Iraq War.

[01:56:50.640 --> 01:56:55.920]
Nathan Bedford Forest, successful Confederate General, said it best about winning in victory and the means to do so.

[01:56:56.300 --> 01:57:04.460]
He said, get their first list with the mostest, said Representative Ted Poe, Fabrician Republican of Texas, in a one-minute or four speech at the beginning of Monday session in the House Representatives.

[01:57:05.280 --> 01:57:07.400]
He then called on Congress to fund the war in Iraq.

[01:57:07.920 --> 01:57:12.900]
Congress needs to send the generals the mostest Mr. Speaker needs to send equipment and personnel that is needed.

[01:57:13.220 --> 01:57:17.460]
Doing this will help our mission in spite of the congressional surrender groups desire to retreat and quit he added.

[01:57:18.420 --> 01:57:25.800]
Pollock dot forest history is founder of the Ku Klux Klan and it isn't an addition to fighting on the side of the Confederacy.

[01:57:26.180 --> 01:57:27.100]
Just minor details.

[01:57:28.660 --> 01:57:37.380]
Although he repeatedly denied membership, even lying to Congress, forced in fact led the clans to one of its most violent and successful periods when World Terrorist Sufci did an ruling back in the House of the Ku Klux Klan.

[01:57:37.840 --> 01:57:41.860]
Reconstruction. Reconstruction. Can you believe that?

[01:57:42.140 --> 01:57:42.820]
Go ahead. Hit it.

[01:57:43.540 --> 01:57:46.160]
It's not in there. It's already in the room. We're getting ready to put them on.

[01:57:46.340 --> 01:57:49.620]
Come on, we're going to FedEx it to you when they will dispense it to the authority.

[01:57:50.020 --> 01:57:50.580]
I'll distribute it.

[01:57:51.320 --> 01:57:52.500]
And they'll just pee in their pants.

[01:57:53.060 --> 01:57:58.560]
He even told one newspaper report that while he was no member, he intended to kill radical Republicans according to Southern Property Law Center.

[01:57:59.080 --> 01:58:04.340]
Rule calls heard on the Hill column, which first revealed the speech column also in order to poll in fact misquoted forest,

[01:58:04.420 --> 01:58:06.780]
who had said to get their fastest instead of first.

[01:58:10.080 --> 01:58:19.340]
Tom Hanks titular character in the 1994 Academy Award winning Film Forest Gump, which freely riffs on the controversial chapters in American history, was named after the Confederate General and Klan founder,

[01:58:19.340 --> 01:58:24.560]
Gump's mother named him forest because sometimes we all do things that well just don't make no sense.

[01:58:24.620 --> 01:58:26.540]
Like Go Watch a Movie like that, for example.

[01:58:27.200 --> 01:58:32.960]
So what do we ever decide about Spider-Man 3? We had a very, uh, apparently, the only person that thought it was okay.

[01:58:33.300 --> 01:58:36.000]
And everyone wanted sucks. I meant, the only one in the world.

[01:58:37.100 --> 01:58:39.520]
Well, how could it have made all that money? I guess just because of the hype.

[01:58:39.740 --> 01:58:42.320]
Usually word of mouth, I don't give them any sense with their mouth.

[01:58:42.600 --> 01:58:46.000]
People like to rip, you know, and I stand by what I said. It wasn't long on plot.

[01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:48.620]
It was just not boring. It had a lot of stuff going on.

[01:58:48.660 --> 01:58:50.840]
Yeah, but it's a jubus triangle was making it in there, you said.

[01:58:51.240 --> 01:58:54.440]
As he's in his, uh, uh, like, you know, he was in his surfing. He's in his underwear.

[01:58:54.820 --> 01:58:57.660]
He was in his underwear. Well, that's good enough for me. I wouldn't mind being in his underwear.

[01:58:57.780 --> 01:59:03.960]
Emerging from a cloud of greens. Now, how did he look? Did he look like the old James Franco from when he looked really Christian and his old?

[01:59:04.020 --> 01:59:07.980]
He looked pretty good in there. I thought he looked, he looked just fine and he did a fine job.

[01:59:08.440 --> 01:59:11.680]
I see. Well, you're probably see I, I suckered you in the same ad.

[01:59:12.340 --> 01:59:12.660]
What?

[01:59:13.760 --> 01:59:18.440]
That's right. That's right. You're gay. You're not a kid.

[01:59:18.760 --> 01:59:22.180]
Yeah, but that crap. The wife is gay. It's all a big here. Say you got a fine, right?

[01:59:22.320 --> 01:59:25.520]
What did the wife say? No, the wife and the kid. It's all a beard. It's all an act, you know.

[01:59:26.460 --> 01:59:28.480]
Oh, that hold you. Well, you know, Troy Ackman.

[01:59:29.400 --> 01:59:32.120]
Three hundred and six votes on the pool, which means we got 13 or six.

[01:59:32.260 --> 01:59:36.720]
I think we're going for 1400 total, which means we're going for 400 on this second pool of the day.

[01:59:37.340 --> 01:59:38.320]
What do you think, Chris? Can we?

[01:59:40.020 --> 01:59:44.280]
All right, then. You must have turned yourself off or somebody did.

[01:59:45.480 --> 01:59:49.020]
You back? I hear you. I don't hear him. There you are.

[01:59:49.620 --> 01:59:51.540]
We didn't hear you for a second. We heard about it. Oh, I see.

[01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:57.280]
But you know earlier, I forgot to mention to you on the year earlier, you just dropped out and I looked down and the red light was on in the box.

[01:59:57.940 --> 02:00:02.400]
And I thought, oh, we lost and we did for like a second. We lost the French connection.

[02:00:02.520 --> 02:00:05.140]
Every once in a while, there'll be a drive. I said, where did Chris go?

[02:00:06.280 --> 02:00:08.200]
Yeah, that's what I said. Your answer for everything, isn't it?

[02:00:08.220 --> 02:00:13.220]
Don't wait. When you stop talking about the Queen and her bomb movements, why did you get so bent out of shape about that?

[02:00:13.300 --> 02:00:17.440]
I just didn't want to go there. Yeah, yeah, girlfriend.

[02:00:18.420 --> 02:00:23.360]
Well, why not? It's unsavory because I know that it stinks.

[02:00:23.800 --> 02:00:27.400]
The world movement? No, not the world bomb. I don't care what they say.

[02:00:27.640 --> 02:00:30.300]
Let's not go there. Don't start it again. WQIM. Hello.

[02:00:30.660 --> 02:00:33.140]
I knew. Could you? WQIM. Hello.

[02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:39.100]
Nearly just a little fiber port listening to seven, nine, eight, a ticket.

[02:00:39.300 --> 02:00:43.000]
Not released, that interest is sir. Not the least that interested.

[02:00:43.220 --> 02:00:48.380]
Okay. Don't care. No interest. Not playing that game. Don't waste your time.

[02:00:50.420 --> 02:00:55.880]
5.670560, you see the number come out? Let's see what happens next month when the next trend comes out.

[02:00:55.960 --> 02:00:59.260]
They lose that big January and all of a sudden, oh, gee, what happened?

[02:00:59.800 --> 02:01:02.980]
They did the same thing was it last year. I forget how long they'd been on the air.

[02:01:03.720 --> 02:01:11.200]
Remember they had that one month in the beginning, 18 to 34 men and they had those, you know, a couple of wired diaries and they had the bogus number that disappeared to the medium of the next month?

[02:01:12.120 --> 02:01:17.000]
Oh, that's going to be our target demo. We're going to kick ass 18 to 34 and then of course after that it all vanished.

[02:01:18.660 --> 02:01:24.360]
I mean, what's the use? What's the point? Just desperate. We're not playing that game. At least not an issue. I'm not.

[02:01:24.860 --> 02:01:31.060]
I've been doing this too long. We had too many fakers, too many losers come along trying to play the, oh, gee, we're going to kick me a rarge or is that?

[02:01:31.160 --> 02:01:38.640]
No, you're not. You're not doing it now and you're not going to do tomorrow or two weeks from where you're shown or any other time. Trust me. WQIM, hello.

[02:01:39.760 --> 02:01:46.780]
Yes, sir. What do you mean by that? Well, like winter, she said I can't play this. I can't play that.

[02:01:46.800 --> 02:01:53.480]
Because they're censored because we can't, we got the age of censorship. Have you discovered that? FCC and Joyce.

[02:01:54.460 --> 02:02:05.580]
Now who's Joyce? She's the corporate bitch in Naples, Florida. She's the corporate attorney who has made up her own set of rules, which are far more restricted than the FCC, even in their current fascist mentality and tens.

[02:02:05.900 --> 02:02:12.500]
And you don't have like anything to say about that? Of course not. What do you mean I have something to say about it? I can make a policy for the radio station.

[02:02:13.040 --> 02:02:21.160]
But you have a contract and in the contract it says you can't say this. Contracts is that you're going to abide by all company policy and everybody's contracts is that.

[02:02:21.840 --> 02:02:26.140]
Does your target customer in touch? Yeah, I did tell him customer in touch and they didn't get it because there were a bunch of go-em.

[02:02:26.640 --> 02:02:33.180]
Exactly. Terrible. Let me ask you this. When you go to Whittbine, you say you get a machine. What does that mean? I never heard of that before.

[02:02:35.380 --> 02:02:41.500]
You never heard of slot machines before? I see. I'm so out of touch. I didn't even know they had to buy a machine.

[02:02:41.500 --> 02:02:51.180]
See, I hate to break the news, but for several years now all the all the race tracks in the province of Ontario have they're all race senos, just like you got now finally in Florida. And they all have slot machines.

[02:02:51.960 --> 02:03:01.300]
Did you hear about the new legislation? Did you just approve of Florida? Yes, I did. What did I hear about it? Don't you think I'm on the air every day talking about these things? Don't you think I have my nose in the news?

[02:03:02.400 --> 02:03:09.240]
You definitely do what I've never heard of. I wish me a good machine, man. I'll see you. Do you hear about it, George? About what? I don't know. Whatever he was talking about.

[02:03:09.320 --> 02:03:16.660]
300 lung votes on the pole. He don't know what I'm talking about. Good machine. See, you think I'm going there to bet the horses? I don't know. No.

[02:03:20.640 --> 02:03:32.800]
Look, what can I tell you? Would mine race track? You know, they're assuming it's only horses and man, you talk about a place that just just raking in the dough. They got thoroughbreds in the afternoon, harness racing in the night, slots 24 seven. It's like a money machine.

[02:03:33.580 --> 02:03:40.840]
I should have a scan going like that. A machine. It's sucking in the money. WQ AM. Hello.

[02:04:46.020 --> 02:04:50.440]
letter to Jolly Bell Rogers or whatever his name is yeah to Bell and I

[02:04:50.440 --> 02:04:57.120]
said I'll go yeah set a copy across the state and I guess they evaporated in

[02:04:57.120 --> 02:05:01.600]
the mail or were stolen because the SOVs that run the operation never

[02:05:01.600 --> 02:05:05.340]
even responded thank you for your call for roll whatever they just disregarded

[02:05:05.340 --> 02:05:08.260]
what I have because they don't care they're not interested in making up the

[02:05:08.260 --> 02:05:13.760]
care but it's a very dangerous because you didn't expose your boob on TV or

[02:05:13.760 --> 02:05:16.920]
anything like that and what people don't like they could turn off the

[02:05:16.920 --> 02:05:21.300]
channel and it's just a noise because let me ask you something why you why

[02:05:21.300 --> 02:05:24.380]
you venting all of this to me is if I don't know these things I know you know

[02:05:24.380 --> 02:05:27.600]
but I just want maybe somebody will hear what he was on the air maybe

[02:05:27.600 --> 02:05:31.380]
they don't care don't you understand this company doesn't care when you're

[02:05:31.380 --> 02:05:34.520]
going to get through your thick skulls or they don't care they're not going to

[02:05:34.520 --> 02:05:37.160]
read your letter they don't care what I think they don't care what George

[02:05:37.160 --> 02:05:42.040]
thinks they sure don't care what Chris thinks they don't care they screwed it

[02:05:42.040 --> 02:05:47.320]
up and now they're gonna fix it not they put for well on the year they put

[02:05:47.320 --> 02:05:50.020]
stern on the air what after they get near lost in their license with for

[02:05:50.020 --> 02:05:53.840]
well which was an act of lunacy I mean I could go through the whole litany of

[02:05:53.840 --> 02:05:56.380]
things again but it's too depressing I don't have any good mood today so it's

[02:05:56.380 --> 02:06:03.720]

[02:06:22.580 --> 02:06:28.420]
shaking his fist at some boys who were down by the prick they're feeding the

[02:06:28.420 --> 02:06:33.720]
water their hands on their marbles and play things and at half past four

[02:06:33.720 --> 02:06:40.120]
their came a young lady she looked like a pretty young creature she sat on the

[02:06:40.120 --> 02:06:46.000]
grass she pulled up her dress and she showed them her rumbles and laces and

[02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:52.320]
white fluffy duck she said she was learning a new way to bring up her children

[02:06:52.320 --> 02:06:57.700]
so they would not spin while the boys in the barnyard were shoveling

[02:06:57.700 --> 02:07:03.560]
refuge and litter from yesterday's hunt while the girl in the meadow was

[02:07:03.560 --> 02:07:10.320]
rubbing her eyes at the fellow down by the dark he looked like a man with a

[02:07:10.320 --> 02:07:15.840]
size of all home in the country with a big fence out front if he has her

[02:07:15.840 --> 02:07:22.040]
fun like they she'd show him her little pet dog who was subject to bits and

[02:07:22.040 --> 02:07:27.820]
maybe she'd let him grab hold of her small tender hands with the movements so

[02:07:27.820 --> 02:07:34.040]
quick and then she'd bend over and suck on his candy so tasty made a

[02:07:34.040 --> 02:07:40.200]
butter squash and then he spread with cream all over her cookies that she had

[02:07:40.200 --> 02:07:45.860]

[02:13:03.160 --> 02:13:09.160]
documentary the other day about the 9-11 attacks yeah the uh they they were saying that

[02:13:09.160 --> 02:13:15.740]
um there were I mean a lot of it is is very um damaging I guess to the government I mean there

[02:13:15.740 --> 02:13:20.820]
was obvious cover up right and uh but but there's something that they say that I just think is

[02:13:20.820 --> 02:13:26.440]
well I mean they say that a missile came out of the planes before the the the towers they say

[02:13:26.440 --> 02:13:31.760]
that a plane didn't hit the Pentagon but most of the witnesses say that that that a plane did

[02:13:31.760 --> 02:13:37.760]
hit the Pentagon but if they would just stick to the the the most damaging uh things to the

[02:13:37.760 --> 02:13:43.380]
the case like you know what what hit you know no point in how you're less like it's like the who killed

[02:13:43.380 --> 02:13:48.380]
JFK it's like all of these things we'll never know the truth well that's what the government does

[02:13:48.380 --> 02:13:52.500]
best they cover things up they do it they they they may be inept in every other respect we'll

[02:28:11.220 --> 02:28:15.180]
a broncare and he won't confess

[02:28:16.780 --> 02:28:22.780]
I don't care what they say cause O'Jay, but it her where we love

[02:28:26.020 --> 02:28:40.400]
It happens so soon on the 12th of June and O'Jay ran away from that bloody mess

[02:28:42.020 --> 02:28:47.900]
I don't care what they say cause O'Jay, but it her where we love

[02:28:47.900 --> 02:28:59.180]
Oh my God, I have waited one or one but I see he's still on trial

[02:28:59.180 --> 02:29:08.800]
It goes on and never ends as it does I know that O'Jay murdered them

[02:29:08.800 --> 02:29:15.460]
Lock him up please and throw away the keys

[02:29:15.460 --> 02:29:22.440]
It's the game of the claims of his innocence

[02:29:23.820 --> 02:29:29.760]
I don't care what they say cause O'Jay murdered her where we love

[02:29:29.760 --> 02:29:32.940]
It happens so soon on the 12th of June and O'Jay murdered them

[02:29:32.940 --> 02:29:37.920]
I don't care what they say cause O'Jay murdered her where we love

[02:29:37.920 --> 02:29:40.280]
Are you sure? That's the gloomy

[02:29:43.660 --> 02:29:45.660]
He did it Chris, he got four on eight

[02:29:45.660 --> 02:29:49.160]
I have a little bit of a little lunch here, a little salami and some Swiss cheese

[02:29:49.160 --> 02:29:52.480]
Not craft by the way, but it pleased you

[02:29:52.480 --> 02:29:55.880]
Well if you had all that fondue from the melting pot, why can't I have a little something so

[02:29:55.880 --> 02:29:59.960]
Well no cheese this time remember? But yes, what do you mean?

[02:30:00.360 --> 02:30:01.940]
We just had to meet if you recall

[02:30:01.940 --> 02:30:04.140]
Well I got my meat and cheese, I do like that

[02:30:04.140 --> 02:30:05.460]
I'm gonna die later

[02:30:06.140 --> 02:30:08.000]
Yeah, pretty good too

[02:30:08.560 --> 02:30:10.660]
I got my master, General Salami

[02:30:11.940 --> 02:30:14.460]
Salami the genus in French

[02:30:16.320 --> 02:30:18.300]
Sands lactose, Sands lactose

[02:30:18.300 --> 02:30:20.360]
How could Salami have lactose in anyone?

[02:30:21.020 --> 02:30:21.880]
You'd be surprised

[02:30:22.800 --> 02:30:23.780]
What do you mean by that?

[02:30:24.080 --> 02:30:26.100]
All they put lactose in all kinds of things I imagine

[02:30:26.100 --> 02:30:27.780]
Oh, ff!

[02:30:28.540 --> 02:30:31.140]
And I got my cheese slices which are just loaded with lactose

[02:30:32.980 --> 02:30:35.320]
I'm not lactose intolerance because if I were to be dead

[02:30:37.700 --> 02:30:39.200]
Right, I just love cheese

[02:30:39.200 --> 02:30:42.000]
I don't think there's gonna be anybody in the world who's cheese more than I do

[02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:43.160]
I'll kind of cheeses

[02:30:44.420 --> 02:30:46.220]
Cheeses are probably assy-ago, man

[02:30:46.980 --> 02:30:50.500]
If anybody ever had anything as good as a piece of assy-ago cheese

[02:30:51.240 --> 02:30:53.120]
And you remember what that guy said in the Godfather?

[02:30:54.220 --> 02:30:54.880]
Jack Walz

[02:30:56.680 --> 02:30:57.700]
He was beautiful

[02:30:58.280 --> 02:30:59.900]
He was young, he was innocent

[02:31:00.340 --> 02:31:02.700]
He was the greatest piece of ass I ever had

[02:31:02.700 --> 02:31:04.160]
And I've had him all over the world

[02:31:04.660 --> 02:31:05.380]
That's pretty same

[02:31:05.380 --> 02:31:07.600]
I was just before he found the horse's head and his back

[02:31:08.340 --> 02:31:09.300]
Piece of horse

[02:31:10.760 --> 02:31:11.640]
This is really good

[02:31:11.640 --> 02:31:13.520]
See, this is excellent because now this is my lunch

[02:31:13.520 --> 02:31:15.940]
I have my bacon for breakfast, this is my lunch

[02:31:17.520 --> 02:31:19.440]
Then I go to wood vinyl and lose my lunch

[02:31:20.040 --> 02:31:21.040]
What are you gonna do with that?

[02:31:21.100 --> 02:31:21.980]
Gonna find a good machine?

[02:31:22.700 --> 02:31:25.200]
Seriously, between a guy, I don't know which was better

[02:31:25.840 --> 02:31:30.280]
That guy, or the guy who said yesterday, he saw the president of Sirius on TV

[02:31:30.280 --> 02:31:31.600]
So that guy, the Sirius guy?

[02:31:31.960 --> 02:31:33.300]
The Sirius guy, meaning Sirius

[02:31:35.920 --> 02:31:36.280]
Sirius?

[02:31:36.700 --> 02:31:37.520]
Yeah, he was Sirius

[02:31:37.520 --> 02:31:39.940]
And that's the best part of it is he was Sirius, he's an idiot

[02:31:42.060 --> 02:31:42.640]
WDQYM, hello

[02:31:42.640 --> 02:31:44.220]
Hey, Neil, how are you doing, Charlie?

[02:31:44.540 --> 02:31:44.960]
Okay, sir

[02:31:45.500 --> 02:31:47.300]
Daniel, that thing that you just played

[02:31:47.300 --> 02:31:49.720]
The real song was T2 Guys

[02:31:49.720 --> 02:31:51.440]
What was the name of the group?

[02:31:51.700 --> 02:31:54.000]
Peter and Gordon, world without love

[02:31:54.000 --> 02:31:57.040]
I heard something that the Beatles wrote that song

[02:31:57.040 --> 02:31:57.520]
They did

[02:31:58.420 --> 02:32:00.680]
That is correct, that is absolutely correct, sir

[02:32:00.680 --> 02:32:02.160]
Man, you've got your thumb right on it

[02:32:02.160 --> 02:32:03.880]
Oh, I sure, you have a good day, alright?

[02:32:03.900 --> 02:32:06.660]
Capital records, too, by the way, Peter and Gordon, the world without love

[02:32:07.860 --> 02:32:09.880]
I played that on here when I was a disjurkey

[02:32:09.880 --> 02:32:11.180]
Now I'm just a jerky

[02:32:12.220 --> 02:32:15.140]
I'm not answering that line nine, by the way, in fact, I may never answer it again

[02:32:16.580 --> 02:32:18.020]
I should probably give that number out

[02:32:18.020 --> 02:32:20.040]
I don't even know what that number is

[02:32:21.600 --> 02:32:22.640]
That's the toll free number

[02:32:22.640 --> 02:32:23.720]
You know what it is?

[02:32:23.860 --> 02:32:24.440]
Yeah, 877

[02:32:24.440 --> 02:32:26.680]
Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute

[02:32:26.680 --> 02:32:27.480]
I'm about to throw it on

[02:32:27.480 --> 02:32:28.680]
Aww, huh?

[02:32:29.680 --> 02:32:30.100]
I'll stop

[02:32:30.100 --> 02:32:30.900]
What would I just do?

[02:32:31.000 --> 02:32:33.220]
This thing's been sitting there so nicely for five years

[02:32:33.220 --> 02:32:34.280]
Did you just mong?

[02:32:34.780 --> 02:32:37.580]
No, no, I just pulled the thing over there and I ripped the appends

[02:32:37.580 --> 02:32:38.100]
It's okay

[02:32:38.100 --> 02:32:39.360]
1-877

[02:32:41.400 --> 02:32:41.760]
785

[02:32:44.560 --> 02:32:44.920]
6345

[02:32:44.920 --> 02:32:47.040]
Well, who the hell would remember a number like that?

[02:32:47.180 --> 02:32:49.080]
Not me, that's why we did off the post-it note

[02:32:49.080 --> 02:32:49.760]
Oh

[02:32:51.520 --> 02:32:53.540]
Let me take that back on here again

[02:32:54.220 --> 02:32:55.740]
Ah, this is not good, man

[02:32:55.740 --> 02:32:57.100]
I don't like the way that came out

[02:32:57.620 --> 02:32:57.980]
Bastard

[02:32:58.740 --> 02:33:01.280]
Anyway, 1-877785

[02:33:01.980 --> 02:33:02.340]
6345

[02:33:02.340 --> 02:33:04.840]
Because online that's the toll free line like if you're in Palm Beach

[02:33:04.840 --> 02:33:08.400]
We're like in Chicago or in Canada when you're somewhere like that

[02:33:08.400 --> 02:33:10.240]
Because all we get now online when we do that

[02:33:10.240 --> 02:33:11.040]
That's all we get

[02:33:12.380 --> 02:33:12.740]
What?

[02:33:12.980 --> 02:33:13.280]
That's a prize

[02:33:13.720 --> 02:33:15.640]
Oh yeah, what a shock, that's why I punched it up

[02:33:15.640 --> 02:33:16.640]
Because there is no doubt

[02:33:16.640 --> 02:33:17.300]
That's what we get

[02:33:17.300 --> 02:33:18.600]
Ah, where was that?

[02:33:18.880 --> 02:33:18.880]

[02:33:20.420 --> 02:33:22.240]
Do the heck of a job on that jolly joke

[02:33:22.240 --> 02:33:24.640]
Let me tell you, you and your Sherlock Holmes crowd

[02:33:24.640 --> 02:33:25.660]
And to hold the guns in a shoulder

[02:33:26.280 --> 02:33:26.300]
That should go screening

[02:33:27.140 --> 02:33:28.980]
Yeah, oh yeah, love the screenness, okay?

[02:33:30.180 --> 02:33:30.580]
Screenness

[02:33:31.840 --> 02:33:33.060]
W-Q-A-M, hello

[02:33:33.060 --> 02:33:34.820]
Yeah, do you know how the gate channel is there?

[02:33:34.960 --> 02:33:35.420]
I got a gate

[02:33:35.420 --> 02:33:36.600]
W-Q-A-M, hello

[02:33:37.060 --> 02:33:39.440]
Hey, did you know 50s actor Johnny Zamora?

[02:33:40.300 --> 02:33:41.020]
50s Western?

[02:33:41.840 --> 02:33:42.340]
The Samar?

[02:33:43.700 --> 02:33:44.500]
Ronnie Zamora

[02:33:44.500 --> 02:33:46.280]
Johnny, Johnny Zamora

[02:33:46.280 --> 02:33:48.840]
Ronnie Zamora, he's got out, Ronnie Zamora

[02:33:49.960 --> 02:33:51.800]
W-Q-A-M, hello, nice going, Ellis

[02:33:51.800 --> 02:33:54.580]
Man, can you believe it's May 8th at already the first

[02:33:54.580 --> 02:33:57.020]
Q-D-Copical Storm is on its way to Florida

[02:33:57.020 --> 02:33:57.840]
It is?

[02:33:57.840 --> 02:33:58.320]
Yes

[02:33:58.780 --> 02:33:59.760]
When is that?

[02:33:59.880 --> 02:34:04.340]
It's off the coast of Georgia and Jacksonville, Florida right now

[02:34:05.300 --> 02:34:06.280]
That's a South Florida

[02:34:06.280 --> 02:34:07.020]
It's huge

[02:34:07.640 --> 02:34:09.140]
Not the South Florida, sir

[02:34:09.140 --> 02:34:09.840]
It's on its way

[02:34:09.840 --> 02:34:11.660]
Yeah, you're on your way, okay?

[02:34:11.760 --> 02:34:13.780]
You're on your way to a mental institution, it's on its way

[02:34:13.780 --> 02:34:15.520]
What is that man talking about? Do you have any idea?

[02:34:16.000 --> 02:34:16.000]

[02:34:16.920 --> 02:34:18.260]
I mean, let me go through the rail

[02:34:19.500 --> 02:34:19.860]
I...

[02:34:21.260 --> 02:34:23.440]
Better not miss with our ballgame Thursday, I'll say to that

[02:34:23.440 --> 02:34:24.040]
Oh, boy

[02:34:26.300 --> 02:34:27.660]
I already looked it up, we're safe

[02:34:27.660 --> 02:34:28.960]
Don't sweat it

[02:34:28.960 --> 02:34:29.340]
Good

[02:34:31.020 --> 02:34:32.180]
My name is Ray Dar, okay?

[02:34:34.960 --> 02:34:36.940]
Ray Dar image from the Mimey from the National

[02:34:36.940 --> 02:34:38.000]
Who's the Director now?

[02:34:38.440 --> 02:34:40.380]
Oh, look at that, there's some spotty crap around

[02:34:40.380 --> 02:34:42.840]
Look at that, West... that's all ground clutter

[02:34:43.640 --> 02:34:45.180]
There's no rain, is it raining? No

[02:34:45.180 --> 02:34:46.460]
And you wouldn't know anyway

[02:34:46.460 --> 02:34:47.080]
Right

[02:34:47.080 --> 02:34:48.340]
Let me hit the loop

[02:34:48.340 --> 02:34:49.480]
The loop-de-loop

[02:34:52.440 --> 02:34:55.480]
Oh yeah, there is some crap, some showers off in the Everglades

[02:34:55.480 --> 02:34:56.240]
Into the West

[02:34:56.240 --> 02:34:58.280]
And, you know, I don't know if that's real rain or not

[02:34:58.280 --> 02:35:00.260]
I guess South... South Dade

[02:35:00.900 --> 02:35:01.880]
It's raining over there

[02:35:02.600 --> 02:35:04.600]
Well, what the hell is that all about? It's not supposed to rain

[02:35:04.600 --> 02:35:06.220]
Don't tell me the weather forecast has screwed up

[02:35:06.220 --> 02:35:07.460]
We can't afford any rain on Thursday

[02:35:09.240 --> 02:35:12.440]
Let me just tell you right now if there's any problem with that game on Thursday

[02:35:13.560 --> 02:35:14.060]
It'll be on

[02:35:14.060 --> 02:35:15.580]
Chris is on, Chris is on it

[02:35:15.580 --> 02:35:16.080]
It'll be just...

[02:35:16.080 --> 02:35:17.220]
Both of you guys, you're on

[02:35:17.220 --> 02:35:18.760]
It's the Georgian-Criscio

[02:35:18.760 --> 02:35:20.740]
You can get West's name, you can get your boyfriend in there

[02:35:21.120 --> 02:35:21.580]
Who's that?

[02:35:22.180 --> 02:35:22.500]
Josh

[02:35:22.960 --> 02:35:23.560]
Oh yeah

[02:35:24.500 --> 02:35:24.820]
Daro

[02:35:25.280 --> 02:35:26.320]
W-Q-Y-M, hello

[02:35:26.320 --> 02:35:27.320]
Daro, tell me your rain

[02:35:27.700 --> 02:35:28.780]
W-Q-Y-M, hello

[02:35:30.180 --> 02:35:31.360]
Q-Y-M, hola

[02:35:31.360 --> 02:35:33.620]
Rookie, want to play basketball or leave like...

[02:35:33.620 --> 02:35:34.580]
W-Q-Y-M, hello

[02:35:35.420 --> 02:35:35.980]
Hello, Neil?

[02:35:36.340 --> 02:35:36.620]
Yeah

[02:35:37.120 --> 02:35:37.840]
How you doing, Neil?

[02:35:38.220 --> 02:35:38.640]
Okay, sir

[02:35:39.260 --> 02:35:41.600]
I like your shot of David working on walk-a-graphics

[02:35:43.220 --> 02:35:44.140]
Yeah, shout this

[02:35:44.940 --> 02:35:47.080]
W-Q-Y-M, shout it out, Q-Y-M, hello

[02:35:47.080 --> 02:35:48.700]
Yeah, I'm holding for DJ Lad

[02:35:51.440 --> 02:35:52.760]
W-Q-Y-M, hello

[02:35:54.900 --> 02:35:55.540]
Hello, Neil?

[02:35:57.440 --> 02:35:59.420]
Yeah, that's it, that was the car, I knew it was the car

[02:35:59.420 --> 02:36:01.640]
I thought maybe he just might, but that was it

[02:36:02.460 --> 02:36:04.880]
He shot all his energy, he shot his...

[02:36:05.280 --> 02:36:06.160]
Oh, sorry, Joyce

[02:36:06.980 --> 02:36:08.460]
Both, W-Q-Y-M, hello

[02:36:08.840 --> 02:36:10.620]
Not rain, it's Jesus, keep the hand

[02:36:12.240 --> 02:36:15.280]
20-till-2 at 5-60 W-Q-Y-M, we got the Mandel coming at 2

[02:36:15.280 --> 02:36:16.620]
We got the Humper coming at 4

[02:36:16.620 --> 02:36:20.060]
He's, we're trying to start a campaign to see if we can't keep Hank alive

[02:36:20.060 --> 02:36:22.460]
At least for the rest of the Triple Crown anyway

[02:36:23.900 --> 02:36:28.040]
W-Q-Y-M was telling me he looked like puffed up like a Bufo totor something on his handspin

[02:36:28.040 --> 02:36:29.160]
And emailed it, you got

[02:36:29.800 --> 02:36:32.320]
I know what it was, you're so touchy today, man

[02:36:32.320 --> 02:36:33.940]
First about the Queen, look at that now

[02:36:33.940 --> 02:36:36.260]
Oh, that's not a problem, it's just a problem, it's just a problem

[02:36:36.260 --> 02:36:39.440]
Just relax, relax, we're having a fun Tuesday here, man

[02:36:39.440 --> 02:36:40.880]
Boys leaving my relationship with Hank

[02:36:40.880 --> 02:36:42.480]
Oh, God

[02:36:42.480 --> 02:36:46.440]
From the makers of Manny 911 and Supernanny

[02:36:46.440 --> 02:36:51.360]
Comes a Hollywood twist on this show, entitled Celebrity Nanny

[02:36:51.360 --> 02:36:55.680]
Join us in episode 1 as we bring in Alec Baldwin

[02:36:55.680 --> 02:36:58.520]
Alec, please do a shout out

[02:36:58.520 --> 02:37:02.620]
That's exactly what he's going to do to this suburban couple's little girl

[02:37:02.620 --> 02:37:07.780]
with his somewhat controversial Nanny Inc. style of calling the child names

[02:37:07.780 --> 02:37:10.780]
You are a rude, robust little kid

[02:37:10.780 --> 02:37:14.120]
Watch as Alec plays forward games with a little girl

[02:37:14.120 --> 02:37:17.560]
Then acts like a really sore loser when she wins all the time

[02:37:17.560 --> 02:37:19.740]
You've made me feel like sh**

[02:37:19.740 --> 02:37:21.960]
And you've made me feel like a fool

[02:37:21.960 --> 02:37:25.500]
Over and over and over again

[02:37:25.500 --> 02:37:28.120]
Alec takes losing board games very personally

[02:37:28.700 --> 02:37:31.820]
You've been salted me for the last five

[02:37:31.820 --> 02:37:33.840]
As he then refuses to play anymore

[02:37:33.840 --> 02:37:36.960]
I'm tired of playing this f**king damn game with you

[02:37:36.960 --> 02:37:39.820]
Alec tells the girl that he would play other games with her

[02:37:39.820 --> 02:37:41.860]
Except there's just one little problem

[02:37:41.860 --> 02:37:44.960]
You don't have to blame for the dee-nessy

[02:37:44.960 --> 02:37:46.420]
As a human being

[02:37:46.420 --> 02:37:49.120]
Is yelling at a child like this inappropriate?

[02:37:49.620 --> 02:37:51.300]
Alec sure doesn't think so

[02:37:51.300 --> 02:37:53.640]
I don't give a damn that you're 12 years old

[02:37:53.640 --> 02:37:54.880]
Or 11 years old

[02:37:54.880 --> 02:37:55.800]
Or that you're a child

[02:37:55.800 --> 02:37:59.400]
I don't eat the most interesting style of Nanny ever

[02:37:59.400 --> 02:38:04.260]
I'm gonna really make sure you get what a real little fake you really are

[02:38:04.260 --> 02:38:09.120]
Join Alec Baldwin as our very first ever Celebrity Nanny

[02:38:09.120 --> 02:38:11.440]
I made an ass of myself

[02:38:12.120 --> 02:38:13.780]
Yes, yes you have

[02:38:13.780 --> 02:38:16.720]
147 and who cares you know I'm so sick and tired

[02:38:16.720 --> 02:38:19.160]
That's why I've played that because everybody's all whipped up about that

[02:38:19.160 --> 02:38:20.980]
It's either an in the cool or it's Alec Baldwin

[02:38:20.980 --> 02:38:23.300]
Only Kim Jong-il should care about Alec Baldwin

[02:38:23.300 --> 02:38:26.400]
Because he's got him and he don't know what to do with him

[02:38:26.960 --> 02:38:29.420]
434 Chris, 1434 to day total

[02:38:29.420 --> 02:38:31.900]
It doesn't like it because it's two different pulls

[02:38:31.900 --> 02:38:33.340]
I don't know a problem with that

[02:38:33.340 --> 02:38:35.120]
Well good

[02:38:36.500 --> 02:38:41.220]
Oh bad news, a bearded Arctic CEO captured yesterday in the tarp and river in Fort Lauderdale

[02:38:42.000 --> 02:38:44.460]
Died late this morning at SeaWorld in Orlando

[02:38:45.940 --> 02:38:46.580]
He died

[02:38:46.580 --> 02:38:48.740]
Should we all sit around and say, Cutish for the Assume?

[02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:50.760]
You know why he died? Well I'll get to this in a second

[02:38:50.760 --> 02:38:51.760]
I like Cutish cheese

[02:38:51.760 --> 02:38:56.060]
The 6 foot 300 pound bearded seal was between two and 300 pounds underweight

[02:38:56.060 --> 02:39:00.400]
And severely dehydrated though veterinarians will know if the animal had an underlying disease as well

[02:39:00.400 --> 02:39:02.560]
Until any crops used on later today

[02:39:04.140 --> 02:39:06.240]
Last night it was very depressed

[02:39:06.980 --> 02:39:10.540]
And we saw more of that this morning said Chris Dole they stepped out at the park

[02:39:10.540 --> 02:39:12.560]
Unfortunately the animal became even more unresponsive

[02:39:13.160 --> 02:39:15.440]
And we had to try to resuscitate him but we could not

[02:39:15.440 --> 02:39:16.900]
It became depressed, you want to know why?

[02:39:17.360 --> 02:39:17.460]
Why?

[02:39:17.680 --> 02:39:20.620]
Because it started out in wherever the hell it was and it wound up in South Florida

[02:39:20.620 --> 02:39:22.140]
Wouldn't you be depressed? Sure

[02:39:23.080 --> 02:39:23.860]
And it said

[02:39:23.860 --> 02:39:25.180]
I'm dying over here

[02:39:25.180 --> 02:39:30.200]
The seal arrived in Orlando last night and the hopes he could be rehabilitated for return to the wild but he died

[02:39:31.000 --> 02:39:34.040]
Wildlife officials rescued the seal in Fort Lauderdale's Tarpon River Monday

[02:39:34.040 --> 02:39:36.240]
Thousands of miles from its icy home waters

[02:39:36.240 --> 02:39:38.800]
If you start out in the Arctic and you wind up in Fort Lauderdale

[02:39:38.800 --> 02:39:40.280]
Oh geez I'd be depressed

[02:39:41.740 --> 02:39:46.540]
Restewers kept to the seal which had bumps and bruises but didn't appear to have any major trauma in the late afternoon

[02:39:47.640 --> 02:39:52.060]
The old said the mammal's feeding patterns are most likely off because it was so far from his natural element

[02:39:52.060 --> 02:39:57.440]
The seal would have gotten most of his hydration from his food foraging for crustaceans and bottom feeding fish

[02:39:58.460 --> 02:40:02.160]
Being out of his natural element being dehydrated I think the animal was just too far gone

[02:40:02.160 --> 02:40:07.380]
The old said the seal appeared to have been the proper length from the old male that goes on and on and on

[02:40:07.380 --> 02:40:09.120]
And like yeah

[02:40:09.720 --> 02:40:11.080]
That's what we care about in Fort Lauderdale

[02:40:11.080 --> 02:40:16.080]
We care about people too much but we care about manatees and bearded whatever this thing was

[02:40:16.080 --> 02:40:17.100]
What was it a bearded seal?

[02:40:18.100 --> 02:40:18.500]
Yes

[02:40:19.600 --> 02:40:24.520]
Well I mean that's sad you know I'm an animal lover but never really big on bearded seals were you?

[02:40:25.140 --> 02:40:26.420]
I didn't know they had them

[02:40:26.420 --> 02:40:28.280]
Well I didn't either I'll be till today

[02:40:28.280 --> 02:40:30.680]
We thought I found them now and now he's dead

[02:40:31.620 --> 02:40:32.580]
And you wanted to why?

[02:40:32.720 --> 02:40:34.640]
Because why do you go to South Florida to die?

[02:40:35.200 --> 02:40:35.620]
That's right

[02:40:35.620 --> 02:40:37.300]
That's why he showed up there

[02:40:37.300 --> 02:40:39.460]
See they're acting like it's some big mystery

[02:40:39.460 --> 02:40:42.420]
That's why every creature goes to South Florida to die

[02:40:42.860 --> 02:40:46.760]
Now if you actually started off there you know obviously you want to get out before that happens

[02:40:46.760 --> 02:40:47.580]
Get out

[02:40:49.600 --> 02:40:50.780]
438 votes on the pool

[02:40:50.780 --> 02:40:52.440]
Let's take a look at what we got here

[02:40:52.440 --> 02:40:54.760]
I am the owner of an overactive blank

[02:40:54.760 --> 02:40:56.760]
Sex drive 96

[02:40:56.760 --> 02:40:58.140]
Oh that's pulling away

[02:40:59.080 --> 02:41:01.100]
Sex drive is moving into the lead

[02:41:01.780 --> 02:41:03.820]
Craving for food 75

[02:41:04.560 --> 02:41:06.860]
Nothing overactive with me 63

[02:41:06.860 --> 02:41:08.780]
We believe you not

[02:41:10.080 --> 02:41:10.760]
Fartmaker 49

[02:41:12.880 --> 02:41:17.180]
See now I'm you know it's kind of interesting because what is the appropriate Fartmaker?

[02:41:17.180 --> 02:41:18.820]
Well what's the right level?

[02:41:19.220 --> 02:41:21.580]
I don't know what's the right level

[02:41:45.200 --> 02:41:47.040]
5 a day or 20 a day

[02:41:47.040 --> 02:41:48.500]
Yeah a couple 3

[02:41:48.500 --> 02:41:49.640]
Around the real people

[02:41:50.540 --> 02:41:51.640]
There you go

[02:41:52.240 --> 02:41:53.500]
I know I can't stop

[02:41:53.500 --> 02:41:55.140]
Sweat glands 15

[02:41:55.140 --> 02:41:57.760]
Mental disorder 13 speaking of the Queen

[02:41:58.460 --> 02:41:59.340]
Paranoia 12

[02:41:59.340 --> 02:42:00.720]
Nervous system 10

[02:42:01.780 --> 02:42:04.820]
Impulse to call radio talk shows but nothing to say 7

[02:42:04.820 --> 02:42:06.640]
Well I think that number ought to be a little bit higher

[02:42:07.800 --> 02:42:14.060]
First 6 hypochondria 2 and thyroid still out of 439 votes has got the big

[02:42:14.060 --> 02:42:17.620]
Nobody even the fantasy cows aren't using that as an excuse anymore

[02:42:18.900 --> 02:42:23.840]
Even being fat most of my life I'm I'm I used to laugh at people they'd have these TV shit like

[02:42:23.840 --> 02:42:27.780]
Corraldo TV shows what would they bring on the 400 pound guy or woman oh well

[02:42:27.780 --> 02:42:30.180]
I've got an overactive thyroid yeah right

[02:42:31.920 --> 02:42:37.520]
As long as I live I'll never forget the show where a horado head that they showed the guy weighed like 600 or 700 pounds

[02:42:37.520 --> 02:42:40.540]
Mm-hmm and he was surrounded by his fat family

[02:42:40.540 --> 02:42:47.580]
Ooh and they all kept bringing food he couldn't get out of bed they had a they had to physically remove him from the bed through a crate with a

[02:42:47.580 --> 02:42:49.620]
Crane through the roof in the house

[02:42:52.360 --> 02:42:54.680]
That's a true story they had to remove him with a crane yeah

[02:42:56.100 --> 02:43:01.380]
They couldn't get him out the dough and they showed all these people sitting around his bedside crying

[02:43:02.380 --> 02:43:06.660]
While they were eating yeah, like in Faso, you know, they're all still better right? That's right

[02:43:07.200 --> 02:43:09.580]
Just like when down takes the little piece of bread

[02:43:09.580 --> 02:43:14.940]
He dumps it in the sauce and the spaghetti sauce and he dips it in the parmesan cheese and he takes a little bite

[02:43:15.600 --> 02:43:22.060]
And he's been crying about his dead cousin and they went to wake or whatever the hell it is and all of a sudden like oh almost and he feels pretty good

[02:43:23.660 --> 02:43:25.280]
You know he's got a big smile on his horse

[02:43:26.160 --> 02:43:29.700]
Hey, Dom you're fairy that's a good movie he hasn't seen Faso

[02:43:29.700 --> 02:43:32.860]
You got to go see that after you finish watching standing in the shadows of a Motown

[02:43:36.440 --> 02:43:43.040]
Yeah, I guess in my I guess I got to go what you're gonna send me the copy how long before spider-man 3 I'm looking

[02:43:43.980 --> 02:43:44.420]
Already

[02:43:48.580 --> 02:43:54.300]
Oh man, you don't waste any time. I'll take that let's go back to the previous full we had today about Stephen movies

[02:43:54.300 --> 02:43:58.240]
I spend much more money on media than I would ever take

[02:44:04.040 --> 02:44:07.300]
For everyone I take I buy two or three so

[02:44:08.260 --> 02:44:11.540]
You know what Joey Sazza says you don't want to give I'll take

[02:44:12.220 --> 02:44:13.920]
That five finger deal again

[02:44:22.020 --> 02:44:26.920]
The life can get convoluted in a lot of different ways. I want to thank my guests today

[02:44:27.540 --> 02:44:33.640]
Now you're the one who was betrayed. Yes, and you're the partner who strayed from your relationship

[02:44:33.640 --> 02:44:39.620]
Of course and how many times have you been with another woman since you've been married more than a thousand

[02:44:41.840 --> 02:44:49.120]
Okay, why Hillary was a great ride but not good enough sounds that make you feel very very ugly

[02:44:49.120 --> 02:44:56.960]
She says he started gagging at the side of her body flabby stomach sagging chest stretch marks. She was a pig. Hey

[02:44:58.620 --> 02:45:03.860]
She spent 20 grand on plastic surgery hoping her husband would only have eyes for her

[02:45:03.860 --> 02:45:09.820]
Yes, but she says it wasn't enough to keep him faithful no because you've cheated since the surgery, right?

[02:45:09.820 --> 02:45:17.860]
I couldn't stop now this woman that you were with Monday night. This was three women three all at one time

[02:45:17.860 --> 02:45:20.880]
Of course, okay. I never wanted that night to end

[02:45:22.380 --> 02:45:30.140]
Are you listening to this yeah, you got a serious decision to make he believes he should be allowed to cheat when he gets bored

[02:45:30.700 --> 02:45:34.960]
You need to get a divorce and move on are you willing to do that? Are you absolutely not?

[02:45:34.960 --> 02:45:39.820]
