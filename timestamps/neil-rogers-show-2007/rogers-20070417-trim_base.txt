[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200]
Did I hear Prime News? Congress convenes congressional hearings on gun control.

[00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.380]
NRA warns legislators not to do anything stupid and no one will get hers.

[00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.120]
Get all the shocking details on tonight's Prime News.

[00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:17.260]
All right.

[00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.360]
Here's a brand new game all the kids are learning to play now.

[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.440]
In every big city across the US of A Now.

[00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.640]
It's called Picture Seltzen Hardware and blow the other fellow away now.

[00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.300]
They've all got guns, guns, guns, guns.

[00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.160]
Out there on the streets today.

[00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.100]
They've got guns, out there on the streets today.

[00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.400]
They've got a music she prodded at the show in town.

[00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.180]
Out there on the streets today.

[00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.600]
Billy Brothers 1, 2, 3, 8 Special to sound now.

[00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.820]
They can tear us a picture and show them up before the bell.

[00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.740]
Now, before the day of that gun, guns, guns.

[00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.800]
Out there on the streets today.

[00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.820]
They've got guns, out there on the streets today.

[00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:19.480]
All the boys and girls you can make like a dream for a night.

[00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.660]
They've got a dream to make.

[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.360]
These are the first few hundred black nests and they've got to tear you away.

[00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.640]
They've got a caravan way.

[00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.380]
So what a town you can't dream.

[00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.480]
You can still join the NRA night.

[00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.600]
They've got guns, guns, guns.

[00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.680]
They can all blow each other away.

[00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.260]
They've got guns, guns, guns.

[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.200]
They've got guns, guns, guns.

[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.860]
Out there on the streets today.

[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.720]
They've got guns, out there.

[00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.600]
I wonder what Charles Chancelet said tonight.

[00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.100]
He's not dead yet, is he?

[00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.400]
No.

[00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:56.960]
Damn it, he was son of a bitch.

[00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.260]
Yeah.

[00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.980]
I wonder what old Charlie with a Spandex pants thinks about it.

[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.440]
That's my favorite scene in bowling for Colabiners.

[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:03.600]
I've only said that.

[00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:04.340]
How many million times?

[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:05.420]
About 30, man.

[00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:06.700]
But you liked it too.

[00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:07.780]
Yeah, it was fun.

[00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.360]
When he went modeling off there after Michael Moore, really, he just caught him with his pantalumi

[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.880]
with his spandex pantalumi down there.

[00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.080]
It was no parting the red sea, but it was still pretty good.

[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.580]
When he whipped up the red sea,

[00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:18.760]
he felt that NRA card.

[00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:19.980]
Finally, padded him on the hand.

[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.480]
Good boy.

[00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:21.100]
Good boy.

[00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.960]
Let's go kill somebody.

[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.760]
All right.

[00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.860]
Hey, that's American Ray, maybe an ain't going to change.

[00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.060]
An ain't going to change.

[00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.200]
There's going to be all kinds of pontificating.

[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.440]
Even the pontiff is probably going to pontificating.

[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.960]
Most important story, though, before we get to that.

[00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:40.000]
And you do realize, I hate to say this, but you do realize it's just another story now.

[00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.760]
Yeah.

[00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.040]
You don't understand this.

[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.580]
It's like an inculcative.

[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.040]
And it's like, uh, an inculcative.

[00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.120]
And it's like, uh, an inculcative.

[00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.240]
And it's like, uh, all of these, uh,

[00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:51.480]
Barnard, these things.

[00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.860]
It's the Rotesque story, do you know?

[00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.720]
Because the public has been desensitized by Rotesque and unacceptable behavior.

[00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.200]
And I love the way they're saying all the condolences are coming in from around the world.

[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.580]
Around the world, what they're really saying is,

[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.200]
there go those barbaric Americans again with their crazy guns shooting the hell out of each other.

[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:09.880]
That's what they're saying.

[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.340]
But nevertheless, those barbarians here in the barbarians are like that.

[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.120]
Remember that cone in in the barbarians?

[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.980]
Mm-hmm.

[00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.560]
So it's twice.

[00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:19.340]
Cape Coral.

[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.020]
Here's an important story that I think you can relate to, especially with the occurence in our game,

[00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.940]
the contestional grief.

[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.520]
A woman arrested for a shoplifting is blamed the crime on irritable bowel syndrome authorities say.

[00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:30.220]
Right.

[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.900]
Correct them.

[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.240]
For a shoplifting, I'm going to start using that as an excuse.

[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:34.300]
I'm going to go out and pick me up.

[00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.660]
Sounds good.

[00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.900]
Great.

[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.680]
Yeah.

[00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:37.560]
What was she doing some emotium?

[00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.240]
Well, can we get to that?

[00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.900]
Right.

[00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.060]
Or it doesn't really say what she's doing.

[00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:47.260]
Helen Gallows, 61 of Clearwater, was arrested Sunday after allegedly shoplifting from a Cape

[00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:48.440]
Coral grocery store.

[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.700]
Well, you know, you've got to get them right groceries, if you've got IBS, maybe she's getting

[00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.560]
some beans, some dinty more beans and stew and oats.

[00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:57.180]
For some beans, no.

[00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:58.780]
Talk about food for goyem.

[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.720]
That would be a good poll to take some day.

[00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.000]
What food is the most for goyem?

[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:04.780]
All right.

[00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:06.920]
I think pork and beans.

[00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:09.940]
I don't know that juicy pork and beans.

[00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.740]
The Daily Reads of Cape Coral reports Gallo reportedly a total of 30s that she couldn't

[00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:21.180]
wait in line, or although as we say in South Florida online, she couldn't wait online because

[00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.400]
she has irritable bowel syndrome, record of the newspaper.

[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.940]
I guess what that means is that nature was calling.

[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.820]
You can relate to that.

[00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:28.400]
Yes, I can.

[00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:33.060]
And so can I, at my advanced stage, Gallo was charged with petty larceny and there it is

[00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.060]
again, PETIT, petty larceny.

[00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:42.300]
Up until I started reading this stupid crap on the year, 100 years ago, it's not a thing

[00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.400]
that you usually see in print.

[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:44.660]
Petite larceny.

[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:45.580]
Are you pardon?

[00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:46.920]
Petite larceny.

[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.480]
Petite.

[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.980]
Yeah, Petite.

[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:49.160]
Tiny little larceny.

[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.660]
Right.

[00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:51.220]
More French crap.

[00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:56.080]
If we didn't get it from the brits we got it from the frogs, maybe that's the problem

[00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.040]
with America right there.

[00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:00.000]
Plus guns and the crazy people like George Bush.

[00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.900]
Gallo was charged with petty larceny released Sunday from the Lee County jail and $500

[00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:04.320]
bond.

[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.920]
She did not answer telephone call placed by the AP to her home.

[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:08.340]
It was known as she had an attorney.

[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.900]
She was shoplifting in the grocery store because she had irritable bowel syndrome and she couldn't

[00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:13.320]
wait online.

[00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:15.300]
So she grabbed the goods and off she went.

[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:17.540]
I can't blame the bitch.

[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.900]
You don't have an EIBS for a long time.

[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:20.740]
It's not good.

[00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:21.420]
It makes it irritable.

[00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.300]
Although I haven't really had the real bad stuff lately.

[00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:28.480]
Oh, and I did mention yesterday and I got sidetracked that I found two restaurants.

[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.360]
Well, not that I found them because I've been eating there for a long time.

[00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.460]
But there are two edible restaurants in Amsterdam.

[00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.260]
Two restaurants where the food is edible.

[00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:39.740]
Although you need the restaurants if you like.

[00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:43.680]
Most of the places there you'd be better knowing on the wood than eating the food.

[00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:44.860]
Oh my god.

[00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:46.400]
Oh, that Dutch cuisine man.

[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:47.180]
That pea soup.

[00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:49.560]
That green pea soup even lend a Blair won't go there.

[00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:51.680]
Can I tell you what the restaurants are?

[00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:52.980]
Sure.

[00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:54.960]
I mean, who knows?

[00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:59.060]
I'm not talking about for your benefit for any of our...

[00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:00.280]
I mean, it's that time of the year.

[00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:01.280]
It's the 17th of April.

[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:02.440]
A lot of people are going on vacation.

[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.860]
Right now is a good time to be planning vacations like my next day to turn to Amsterdam.

[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:07.640]
Oh, brother.

[00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:09.820]
Now, there's Zach who held off the government.

[00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:11.020]
Zach's a good-looking young man.

[00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:11.740]
There's Virginia Tech.

[00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:14.340]
Not that it makes any difference, of course, whether people are good looking or not.

[00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:16.920]
But, you know, we'd much rather look at the ones who look fairly good.

[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.980]
I'm not saying he's real good looking, but he's doable.

[00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:23.120]
Now, that was a terrible thing to say, wasn't it?

[00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:25.500]
I'm a scientist with him and said that.

[00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:27.040]
He wouldn't have said that kid there is doable.

[00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:28.600]
I would not have known if he hadn't.

[00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:30.420]
Well, no, no, no.

[00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:32.880]
How about doable and doable?

[00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:33.400]
All right.

[00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:34.120]
What was I just saying?

[00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:35.420]
Oh, the first one is de Marquis.

[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.220]
Now, I know everyone hot and cold on de Marquis.

[00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:38.980]
He's just like Amsterdam itself, you know?

[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:40.560]
It's like anywhere you go.

[00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:43.200]
If you have a great time, you say, oh, man, what a great place that is.

[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:47.260]
If you have a crappy time or you get sick there or something like that or you get picked

[00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.320]
pocketed, then you say, oh, that's a horrible place.

[00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:49.840]
Don't go there.

[00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:51.320]
De Marquis's on the dam rack.

[00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.620]
That's got a certain alliteration to it, doesn't it?

[00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:55.060]
De Marquis's on the dam rack.

[00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:55.760]
It's not too bad.

[00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:58.060]
And they can't make up their mind what they want to be because they've been sold

[00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:00.420]
about 4,000 times in line, since I've been going there.

[00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:02.560]
Do you know I haven't gone to Amsterdam for 20 years?

[00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:05.740]
Well, I haven't gone to Europe for 20 years.

[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:11.680]
First trip I made to Europe in 1987, I went to Rome, Copenhagen, and Amsterdam.

[00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:14.560]
And you know what kind of time I had?

[00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:15.580]
Yeah, that's it.

[00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:18.960]
Anyway, and the other one is, I don't know what the name of it is.

[00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:19.900]
It's a Mandarin restaurant.

[00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:21.960]
It's south of the dam rack.

[00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:23.160]
It's on the other side of Dam Square.

[00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:26.760]
The southern extension of the dam rack, which is like the main tourist street, is called

[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:27.460]
Rokin.

[00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:29.780]
You know what that means in Dutch?

[00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:30.880]
It means Rokin.

[00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:31.640]
Oh, Rokin.

[00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:32.080]
Huh.

[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:36.620]
Literally, like for your sea science, it's going to say, like in the airport, neat or

[00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:37.840]
Rokin, which means no smoking.

[00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:39.100]
Rokin.

[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:42.620]
And you have to roll the Rs. and you, you, you, you, Holios man, Ruh, Ruh, Ruh, Ruh,

[00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:47.960]
Ruh, Ruh, Ruh, Ruh, Ruh, Ruh, Ruh, Ruh, Ruh, Ruh, Ruh, Ruh, Ruh, Ruh, Ruh, Ruh,

[00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:48.520]
Roll it.

[00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:50.300]
Roll up the rim to win.

[00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:51.220]
And worry about it.

[00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:52.680]
But hey, what's a Mandarin Chinese restaurant?

[00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:53.400]
You go upstairs.

[00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:54.760]
And it's right there.

[00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:56.640]
It's right there.

[00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:00.000]
I guess next time I go, I should figure out the name but as other than that, don't eat

[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:00.220]
there.

[00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:02.420]
Just go to Mickey D's and don't go to KFC.

[00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:02.960]
Wow.

[00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:06.580]
You think you got intestinal problems with that brought over there in a West Coast?

[00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:07.740]
Wow, wow, wow.

[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:13.060]
They have some kind of extra special thing they put in the chicken at KFC and emptied

[00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:13.280]
him.

[00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:14.340]
Or by the time they found them.

[00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:16.040]
And they got burgur King.

[00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:16.960]
There's exactly the same.

[00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:18.720]
That's one thing I would end up with pizza hot.

[00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:24.280]
One thing I will say about fast food joints, and I can't say too much about them, but

[00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:25.800]
that is the consistency.

[00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:28.840]
McDonald's in Amsterdam or in Rome.

[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.960]
If you go to Rome and eat McDonald's, you need to be shot.

[00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.380]
But once I did, moment of stupidity.

[00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:37.080]
Just like a snack, three triple cheeseburgers, something like that.

[00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:41.020]
But it's exactly the same no matter where in the world you eat that stuff.

[00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:46.980]
And in Amsterdam, Mickey D sometimes is a very pleasant, refreshing change from the

[00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:49.440]
swill that they professed his food at most of the restaurant.

[00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:52.220]
So there's a little travel tip for a North to charge.

[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.100]
Here's the pool from yesterday.

[00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:58.500]
And boy, am I proud of myself that we didn't, we're not doing this anymore.

[00:08:58.660 --> 00:08:59.200]
I hate this pool.

[00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:00.120]
Is Miguel aware of that?

[00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:01.060]
Are you aware of that, sir?

[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:02.080]
No.

[00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:04.560]
Now where's Chris and Josh being out today?

[00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:05.280]
What's that all about?

[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:06.040]
Not sure.

[00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:08.860]
Chris said something.

[00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:11.540]
I mean, Chris said, hey, I'm going to be gone tomorrow and then blah, blah.

[00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:13.340]
And then I stopped paying attention because I didn't care.

[00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:16.000]
And then I forget why Josh isn't here.

[00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:16.860]
He'd be fine.

[00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:18.920]
He's probably going to have day from all these guys in the office.

[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:20.640]
I'm going to be able to ask for, I'll tell you.

[00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:24.960]
For a guy that's as marginal looking as Josh and he really is, he's sure gotten a lot

[00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:26.240]
of attention while putting it in this show.

[00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:27.520]
Some product in his hair.

[00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:28.100]
It'd look way better.

[00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:29.800]
Some product?

[00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:30.300]
Yeah.

[00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:31.160]
Some dippity-do.

[00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:33.740]
Oh, I tell you we're talking about product in his laptop.

[00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:38.520]
Assuming there is a God and considering that God created everything both the good, like

[00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:40.880]
low, blue skies, puppies and kittens.

[00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:41.620]
Oh, kittens.

[00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:45.200]
I mean, we were doing so well when we got to puppies and then kittens fell.

[00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:46.160]
Or kittens can be cute.

[00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:48.220]
There's a lot of fun to grow up there.

[00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:52.160]
And the bad, death disease destruction and of course guns.

[00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:55.060]
We're after that man invented guns, but God knew he was going to do it.

[00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:57.440]
What overall grade would he give God?

[00:09:57.620 --> 00:09:59.000]
I've got a B plus on the show yesterday.

[00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:00.580]
Thank you, professor.

[00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:01.880]
B plus, that's not bad.

[00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:06.000]
The first day back onto the box goes to show you, even in my advanced age, I still haven't

[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:06.440]
lost it.

[00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:08.060]
And I'm not scratchy anymore today.

[00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:08.920]
No, you're not.

[00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:11.540]
So I think I got over whatever disease I picked up and I'm stood up.

[00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:12.520]
I didn't pick up no disease.

[00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:13.340]
I did not.

[00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:14.480]
I'm not unclean.

[00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:15.020]
Sorry.

[00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:17.880]
I didn't bring back Noah bad nothing.

[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:21.560]
In fact, I'm ready to go back right now.

[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:23.780]
Oh God, if you knew.

[00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:24.880]
Here's the poll result.

[00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:27.640]
For the last time, I hate this poll wins.

[00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:28.480]
259.

[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:30.780]
The last chance wherever putting that on there, I hate this poll.

[00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:33.860]
Because we just tired of you people with your negotory attitude.

[00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:35.820]
21%.

[00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:43.820]
God gets a C from 243 years and F as in 235, 235.

[00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:45.160]
It was all pretty close.

[00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:46.360]
AC and F.

[00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:48.620]
A, 227.

[00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:50.340]
That's only if God is Canadian, A.

[00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:51.580]
I wonder if God is Canadian.

[00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:55.420]
D 149 and B, 120.

[00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:56.460]
How do you like that?

[00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:58.780]
I've got a B plus and God's a B, only 120.

[00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:00.300]
1233 vote.

[00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:05.060]
Well, I guess what are we going to be talking about today, huh?

[00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:05.460]
All day.

[00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:06.900]
I hope not all day.

[00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:11.200]
Oh, and I got a good article you're like after I'm Mrs. Rush Limbaugh next, conservative

[00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:12.640]
here, the return of the fairness doctor.

[00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:13.440]
And you like that story.

[00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:13.820]
Good.

[00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:14.620]
Give us a little bit of hope.

[00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:15.380]
There's not much hope.

[00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:18.160]
And I got a great column by Gorovidal.

[00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:21.180]
Oh, that's too bad we got Miguel here today because I got a little bit of reading to do.

[00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:22.560]
Not too much though.

[00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:25.020]
I should have held the opportunity.

[00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:28.060]
I should have held the opportunity.

[00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:29.320]
I'm not a bedtime story.

[00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:30.960]
You still love the show, I'm not sure.

[00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:31.520]
I corrupt.

[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:33.660]
You still love the show.

[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:34.400]
Yes.

[00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:36.780]
See how quietly he said that?

[00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:37.900]
He doesn't want to admit it.

[00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:38.120]
Really?

[00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:39.440]
No, you don't love the show.

[00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:40.020]
You just love me.

[00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:40.740]
That's what it is.

[00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:42.660]
Oh, it's PD Lenny stopped by before the show.

[00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:43.820]
Today's back in our sales department.

[00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:46.320]
You notice how I was ignoring him as much as I possibly couldn't.

[00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:48.180]
He didn't pay any attention.

[00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:51.580]
That's what I took a picture just to see the sales people are.

[00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:53.340]
The current incarnation.

[00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:53.860]
What?

[00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:56.380]
The current incarnation of PD.

[00:11:56.380 --> 00:12:00.160]
He was wearing a carnation or the reincarnation.

[00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:00.740]
That could have helped.

[00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:02.300]
Is this the reincarnation of Peter Proud?

[00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:03.240]
That's a pretty good movie.

[00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:03.960]
That was not bad.

[00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:05.760]
With Michael Serison and what's your name?

[00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:06.620]
That you like so much.

[00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:07.420]
What's your name, Jennifer?

[00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:08.560]
I don't know.

[00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:10.400]
Oh, come on.

[00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:11.240]
Flowers?

[00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:12.060]
Oh, Neil.

[00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:13.640]
Jennifer O'Neill, I believe.

[00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:14.240]
I don't know.

[00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:16.300]
The reincarnation of Peter Proud.

[00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:16.320]
Peter Proud.

[00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:16.800]
But I saw it.

[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:17.940]
It was a tennis player, remember that?

[00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:18.260]
No.

[00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:23.420]
Now, let's see if we make the thousands of these without I hate this pool.

[00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:25.100]
That's going to be the real test is that we got you.

[00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:26.400]
So what do you rather have?

[00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:27.580]
Seal test or real test?

[00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:29.780]
Boy, people who eat seal test ice cream.

[00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:30.660]
That's also for glam.

[00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:31.700]
That even exists anymore?

[00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:32.560]
I don't know.

[00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:34.300]
I sure as hell, I hope that.

[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:36.260]
Peter's Lord even loves Neil Rogers.

[00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:38.200]
Honey, I'm home.

[00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:39.240]
I'm up here.

[00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:40.600]
Do you are just in the bedroom?

[00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:41.980]
Oh, dear.

[00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:44.060]
Another dusting accident.

[00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:46.400]
And another stray bullet in the bedroom ceiling.

[00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:48.560]
Yes, during these days of violent crime.

[00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:51.420]
A handgun is a useful item for your bedside table.

[00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:52.800]
But what a dust catcher.

[00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:56.560]
All that oil and fuzz makes you look like America's funniest housekeeper.

[00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:58.440]
Can't someone do something?

[00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:02.160]
American handicrafts has the answer with our beautiful quilted gun cozy.

[00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:05.400]
We brought in homeless grandmothers from around the country who thought they could get

[00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:06.620]
my own social security.

[00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:09.780]
They work at minimum wages, knitting these charming gun covers.

[00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:12.800]
Their beautiful cross stitching spells out messages like guns.

[00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:13.440]
We've gun.

[00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:14.980]
God bless our gun.

[00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:16.740]
Home is where the gun is.

[00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:18.660]
And I heart my gun.

[00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:21.140]
My gun cozy says mom is little helper.

[00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:23.720]
And mine says wake my old lady.

[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.380]
She knows where all the money is.

[00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:30.520]
Yes, when a burglar breaks into your home on a cold dark night, there's nothing more

[00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:33.080]
comforting than reaching for a nice warm gun.

[00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:35.980]
The gun cozy from American handicrafts.

[00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:39.480]
I think instead of doing a show today, we ought to go out and do America's number one hobby.

[00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:40.360]
Kill some people.

[00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:40.860]
There you go.

[00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:42.380]
Even he knew I had to go.

[00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:44.960]
Let's start with him when you say, oh, that sounds like a threat to me.

[00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:46.580]
We're going to get that Neil fired now.

[00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:47.860]
It's written Kill some people.

[00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:48.140]
Yeah.

[00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:51.000]
It's a 1018 at 5.

[00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:52.600]
60 WDQAM station.

[00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:54.440]
It used to be on top of the market, man.

[00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:56.920]
We used to kick ass here once upon a time in America.

[00:13:57.460 --> 00:14:01.920]
And so, well, once upon a time in South America, what do we got today?

[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.940]
We got mad dog at two power hour with mad dog and Hank at four.

[00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:08.040]
And Hank gave the revolutionary news yesterday to Keith Olderman.

[00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:10.340]
Went to the management and said, I'm sorry to be fired.

[00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:12.060]
Didn't we mention that about 50 times on our show?

[00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:13.620]
I mentioned it last week.

[00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:14.340]
Yeah.

[00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:15.700]
And George even mentioned last week.

[00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:18.500]
Well, I just rehashed yesterday what you did last week.

[00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:20.560]
More or less.

[00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:21.140]
More or less.

[00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:22.100]
Probably better, but never.

[00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:22.660]
Oh, I'm sure.

[00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:24.180]
Humber between five and seven.

[00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:26.840]
And by the way, don't you start picking up my good friends now from Florida?

[00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:27.620]
That's not good.

[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:30.760]
Especially the one that, you know, just left here.

[00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:32.380]
They're gone, by the way.

[00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:34.340]
All my friends who are on the trip, all two of them are gone.

[00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:35.560]
And the one who was here, he's still here.

[00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:36.140]
He's working.

[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.560]
I just read your information since you want to keep track of all of this.

[00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:39.980]
Right.

[00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:40.720]
Yeah, don't.

[00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:41.760]
All right.

[00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:45.380]
Since Miguel is in there, Miguel has been there since I wouldn't say since day one.

[00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:46.560]
How long have you been there, about eight years?

[00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:48.020]
Actually, yeah, a year.

[00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:49.960]
Well, I like that.

[00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:50.840]
See what a memory.

[00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:54.080]
Well, the reason I know that is because you replaced an FU, right?

[00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:54.780]
Yes.

[00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:58.980]
And at any rate, some like, you know, he's, you know, he's seen him come and go.

[00:14:59.100 --> 00:14:59.980]
He knows what's going around.

[00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:03.360]
And what I'm going to do is I'm going to take care of George and chicken neck and I will.

[00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:05.420]
Or your sword.

[00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:06.140]

[00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:06.420]
What?

[00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:07.380]
Your sword.

[00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:08.480]
I am.

[00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:13.880]
What I'm going to do instead of just like having like, I don't want to go into it on

[00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:14.160]
the hurricane.

[00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:15.220]
That's not a good idea.

[00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:19.900]
Well, no, because I don't want to give anybody a, it's not a good idea.

[00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:22.000]
That's what started all of this.

[00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:26.160]
Before I like Jacob business, why was my business okay?

[00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:26.460]
I don't know.

[00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:27.540]
And then anybody else's business.

[00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:31.260]
And then I had to go through that long stupid emotional business about, oh, I'm going

[00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:32.380]
to put Jacob, you know what?

[00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:34.180]
Jacob, you can stick it with a moon down shine.

[00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:34.560]
Okay.

[00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:36.000]
If you can find it with both hands.

[00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:36.180]
Right.

[00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:37.380]
Yeah, that's where you can stick it.

[00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:37.940]
Jacob.

[00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:40.580]
Never Jacob Marley.

[00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:42.740]
Who's partner was he?

[00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:43.540]
Ebenezer's screwed.

[00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:44.160]
Well, screw it.

[00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:44.520]
Right.

[00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:46.580]
What do I know that name boy?

[00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:47.040]
You're good.

[00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:47.700]
What?

[00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:49.180]
Those Christmas carols.

[00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:51.400]
I didn't think you gave a crash stuff, man.

[00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:52.600]
I'm a Jewish spy.

[00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:54.260]
I spy on all the go-in.

[00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:58.080]
Hank Goldberg, five to seven to seven with his eight million pounds of fat.

[00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:00.080]
And don't get me started picking on the hubber again.

[00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:00.320]
Okay.

[00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:01.260]
He can't help but that he's fat.

[00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:02.560]
I know all about being fat.

[00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:03.400]
Not good.

[00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:06.860]
Gain night with Eddie Kay at seven o'clock tonight.

[00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:08.040]
What is that all about?

[00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:11.380]
Before and after the Marlin game.

[00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:12.760]
Well, who the hell wants to hang around?

[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:16.360]
So I'm sure he's not going to hit the lock to the strip club while the game is on.

[00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:20.400]
Because who that wants to sit around in there during the entire Marlin game.

[00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:21.960]
Even if he came up with that.

[00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:22.460]
Hey.

[00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:22.720]
No way.

[00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:24.620]
Well, he sit there during the entire game.

[00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:25.000]
Absolutely.

[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.000]
He came up with that.

[00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:27.260]
Absolutely.

[00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:28.180]
Why?

[00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:29.320]
That's what he does.

[00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:34.040]
Gain night with Eddie Kay at seven Marlins on deck at seven thirty.

[00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:36.040]
The Marlins at the Astros 805.

[00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:38.560]
Is Craig Bidjo still playing or did he retire finally?

[00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:39.560]
I think he retired.

[00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:43.580]
You think he just made that up?

[00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:46.240]
No, I really do think he's I can Google it right now.

[00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:47.940]
Google it right now and see if Craig read your boy.

[00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:51.320]
He sure even even last time I saw him play.

[00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:52.380]
He still looked pretty good.

[00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:55.420]
And then when he started talking all those years that he played.

[00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:57.700]
I thought he was like a Southern Yehu kind of kid.

[00:16:58.040 --> 00:16:59.000]
And then he's from Brooklyn.

[00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:02.320]
He talked with a Brooklyn accent like some kind of a I don't know.

[00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:05.540]
And then Gain night with Eddie Kay again after the game from 11 to 11.

[00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:07.320]
And then he went to one of the more and still won a game ends to one of the more.

[00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:10.120]
So Eddie Kay, he got dumped.

[00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:11.420]
We brought him back by time.

[00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:12.760]
He's on more now than he was before.

[00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:16.420]
And that's the way we do it at QAM just like Ray Perry.

[00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:19.220]
Didn't they dump his ass when they fired Greg?

[00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:19.440]
Yeah.

[00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:21.620]
And of course they brought Greg back too over there.

[00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:26.200]
Everybody gets canned sooner or later at QAM and then they all come back like Gary Sarner

[00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:28.920]
and like Scrooan and like Ray Perry.

[00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:29.700]
Who else?

[00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:30.240]
PD Lenny.

[00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:31.740]
He didn't get fired.

[00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:32.620]
No, I don't think he did.

[00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:34.900]
He went to work for Cox Broadcasting.

[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.880]
And let me tell you of all the horse ball broadcast industry.

[00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:41.760]
I mean there's so many bad companies.

[00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:45.120]
But I'm going to tell you Cox Broadcasting one of the words.

[00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:45.880]
That's my opinion.

[00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:46.640]
I'm like this.

[00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:47.120]
Absolutely.

[00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:48.920]
We work there at W.I.D. for those bastards.

[00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:51.820]
And then little Bob Neal gets up there to announce to the staff.

[00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:54.980]
We have an emergency staff meeting that they sold the station to Buddy Bud Paxon.

[00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:57.820]
Well, we tried to make money with it as much as we can.

[00:17:57.980 --> 00:17:59.140]
Now we'll let somebody else try it.

[00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:02.480]
And you know the interesting part of it is that Paxon, they know how to sell.

[00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:03.480]
A little spots on that station.

[00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:04.080]
Remember that?

[00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:04.960]
No.

[00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:07.720]
The log was loaded.

[00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:08.980]
I know it was one time ago.

[00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:09.860]
Our log is loaded.

[00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:13.180]
He's waiting by the way.

[00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:18.800]
Wait till he starts selling that 0.8 in the morning show from last month at 0.8.

[00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:20.060]
That will be a challenge.

[00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:20.840]

[00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:22.440]
I said, I imagine that'll be a challenge.

[00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:25.780]
Duff ran out of their enthusiasm when I mentioned that 0.8.

[00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:27.320]
But it's only one month, you know.

[00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:27.940]
All right.

[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.220]
I'm trying to postpone the inevitable here as much as I can because once I get started

[00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:35.860]
on this and you know, even my own reaction to the attack, I said yesterday I've

[00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:38.180]
known for about for a long time, at least 20, 30 seconds.

[00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:41.100]
And I really, oh, here's a good call by the way.

[00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:41.640]
Q.I.M.

[00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:47.440]
And I thought to myself, how come you didn't get like more, I didn't even

[00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:50.560]
pay that much attention to it anymore because it's the American F and way.

[00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:53.600]
It's just another horrible story of some nut job.

[00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:56.720]
You know, we get a bunch of guns and he gets pissed off about something.

[00:18:57.020 --> 00:19:00.920]
And that's the way we, you know, that's kind of anger management, conflict resolution.

[00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:02.240]
The American F and way.

[00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:03.100]
Naturally we do it.

[00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:06.500]
Got and kill a bunch of people, even people that have nothing to do with why you're

[00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:07.440]
pissed off in the first place.

[00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:13.260]
But just, you know, police identified the gunman who killed 32 people and then himself

[00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:18.260]
on the project, Virginia Tech campus as student, Cho Sun Hui.

[00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:21.920]
University police chief, Wendell Flincham said today.

[00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:26.100]
I, the only reason I mentioned his name again is because it's just so bizarre.

[00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:27.960]
It fits right in with the whole ambiance of the story.

[00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:29.300]
Wendell Flincham.

[00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:34.240]
And what a tremendous job the university did and the police department did

[00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:35.120]
and handling that.

[00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:37.500]
Did they not, not pathetic?

[00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:41.120]
Well, they finally did send out some emails after while.

[00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:42.140]
Check your emails.

[00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:43.060]
That's always a good idea.

[00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:44.540]
Check your emails, boys and girls.

[00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:45.560]
Hope you have a blackberry.

[00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:46.640]
That's right.

[00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:48.780]
See, you're always making fun of me and my crackberry.

[00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:49.780]
Maybe I got it right here.

[00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:50.940]
I got it right here.

[00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:53.520]
No messages on there right at the moment, but that's okay.

[00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:59.300]
The 23-year-old South Korean and resident alien lived at the university's Harper Hall,

[00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:02.200]
Flincham said he was an English major that chief said.

[00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:02.740]
How so?

[00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:03.860]
English major.

[00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:04.880]
Oh, you know something?

[00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:05.460]
Wait a minute.

[00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:09.940]
Now, I'm not, obviously it's a grotesque story.

[00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:13.100]
And I'd be the last, we just have this one bit though.

[00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:14.560]
To take off and enroll.

[00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:16.640]
Golden Panda Dragon Paris.

[00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:20.920]
I'd like to order a massive heart attack.

[00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:24.200]
Okay, a rage, order, general South Chicago.

[00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:27.460]
Can I also get a couple of clogged arteries?

[00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:29.260]
Okay, to agro, what else?

[00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:31.620]
Can I get a side order of hypertension?

[00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:33.400]
One order fried.

[00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:34.460]
That bring more?

[00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:37.680]
Yeah, and I'd like some intestinal discomfort.

[00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:39.380]
Okay, order to be fried out.

[00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:41.320]
And how long before all this food kills me?

[00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:42.660]
About 15 minutes.

[00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:46.040]
I didn't say it was good.

[00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:48.840]
I just said it was to take off on it, although we're doing Chinese and we're over the phone.

[00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:52.380]
Flintham said ballistic test showed that one of the two guns recovered at Norris Hall

[00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:56.220]
where 30 people and the gunmen died was used in the Norris shooting and an earlier shooting

[00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:57.500]
at the dormitory they left to dead.

[00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:01.880]
The university in place are still in the process of releasing the names of the 32 people

[00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:02.980]
killed in the shootings yesterday.

[00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:04.880]
A little bit slow, I guess, on the other day.

[00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:10.040]
A doctorate at Blacksford Hospital described the injuries he saw yesterday as amazing

[00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:11.900]
and the shooter as brutal.

[00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:16.040]
There wasn't a shooting victim that didn't have less than three bullet wounds in them.

[00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:19.900]
And said, Dr. Joseph Kuchyapo of Montgomery Regional Hospital.

[00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:24.260]
Even among the last serious injuries, Kuchyapo said we saw one patient at a bullet wound of the wrist,

[00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:25.900]
one of the elbow and one of the thigh.

[00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:29.200]
We had another one with a bullet wound of the abdomen, one of the chest and one of the head.

[00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:34.640]
A law enforcement source close to the investigation said a 22-hect caliber handgun and a millimeter

[00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:35.880]
handgun recovered at the scene.

[00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:38.420]
Handguns, baby, everybody should have a whole bunch of it.

[00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:39.200]
Get pissed off.

[00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:42.280]
Close somebody away just like that one bit we got, which I have to play a hundred times.

[00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:47.860]
The days for a shooting at the West Ambrer Johnson dormitory, which houses 895 students

[00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:49.620]
occurred around 715 years to day morning.

[00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:53.620]
At the time of the later shootings in the Resolve, please for investigating a person of interest

[00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:55.940]
in the dormitory shooting, Slinchum said.

[00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:57.960]
Or else you'll love that expression, a person of interest.

[00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:03.480]
During the Tuesday news conference, Slinchum said the person of interest was an acquaintance

[00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:04.580]
of a woman killed at the dorm.

[00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:10.660]
They defended the university response to the dorm shooting, saying,

[00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:13.800]
please believe it's to be domestic fight, perhaps a murder of suicide that was contained

[00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:14.540]
in one dorm room.

[00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:15.600]
And they said, they don't worry.

[00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:16.120]
No problem.

[00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:16.660]
No worries.

[00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:18.400]
And not a thing like that.

[00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:24.580]
All of a sudden, he's over there at Norris Hall, blowing people away like, like,

[00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:26.300]
tossing moths of balls against the wall.

[00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:29.560]
Just to say, but again, like I said, America is just used to these things.

[00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:32.420]
Start it with column, see I remember when column by and half of them, I remember that

[00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:32.680]
day.

[00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:37.120]
And I remember thinking to myself, how come people aren't like jumping off tall buildings

[00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:38.440]
and getting hysterical about this?

[00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:42.120]
Why do they, why are Americans so complacent about crap like this?

[00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:43.460]
You can't accept this.

[00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:45.300]
It just isn't, it's just not acceptable.

[00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:47.980]
This is not the way civilized people live.

[00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:52.560]
It's crazy people running around getting pissed off, going to school, and blowing people

[00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:52.820]
away.

[00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:58.080]
Oh, well they were picked on is, oh gee, if I get picked up, I'm going to start telling

[00:22:58.080 --> 00:22:58.720]
you lots of people.

[00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:00.580]
That's right.

[00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:01.080]
So what's up?

[00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:04.120]
Thank you people in the audience that have been bugging the hell out of us for 31 years.

[00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:06.820]
I'm coming after your ass at 2 30 this afternoon.

[00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:08.460]
I can get down to about a half an hour.

[00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:11.660]
Ferries can fly baby, I can flap my wings like a hummingbird.

[00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:12.800]
Pinch them in the leg.

[00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:15.520]
The following is a paid public service announcement from the International Ripeball Association.

[00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:18.380]
Let's face, most of us will never be rich.

[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:21.800]
Hell, we probably won't even be successful and that's pretty damn depressing.

[00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:25.340]
But as usual with every problem there is a solution.

[00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:29.220]
Hi, I'm Jim and I'm here to tell you a little something about handguns.

[00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:33.600]
They scare the sh** out of people and intimidate them and giving you whatever you want.

[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.600]
That's right handguns.

[00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:36.640]
Think about it.

[00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:37.560]
Need some cash?

[00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:38.420]
Rub a bank.

[00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:39.980]
Don't have enough money for beer?

[00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:41.400]
All the convenience store.

[00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:43.580]
Take some chips and pretzels while you're at it.

[00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:45.640]
It's all free if you've got a handgun.

[00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:47.960]
Some son of a bitch cheating on your girlfriend?

[00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:48.800]
Kill him.

[00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:51.560]
It's a simple solution of life's complex problems.

[00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:55.680]
All I have to do is wait the five days for it and happiness is just around the corner.

[00:23:56.380 --> 00:23:58.400]
Hell, if you don't want to wait the five days who cares?

[00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:00.080]
Buy the damn thing of the street.

[00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:02.080]
Just buy a lot of handguns.

[00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:05.580]
It's a great alternative to working problems out and be considered a popular one.

[00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:06.620]
Otherwise you console them.

[00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:07.680]
Yes, handgum.

[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.560]
They just might make your face.

[00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:22.420]
Drop off of my dander and documented the themselves modally.

[00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:24.740]
Listen to me again, my friend.

[00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:27.000]
Now let's break while you meet into last-month Russian traditional punch.

[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.900]
Step by step and pepper it out.

[00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:33.420]
It's fine if my friend knows.

[00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:34.660]
Only you can have it!

[00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:37.760]
Life will be sweeter when you catch your heater

[00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:40.600]
Carry a license to be deadly

[00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:42.960]
Come on and join today

[00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:46.660]
It's the American way to be a member of the NRA

[00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:49.940]
Aim for the beat

[00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:51.620]
Aim for the chest

[00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:53.420]
And always aim for the head

[00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:55.520]
In case they're well, it's not best

[00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:57.080]
Sharp in your skills

[00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:58.500]
And feel more fun

[00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:00.920]
And be there to defend your right

[00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:02.220]
You hold us from

[00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:03.840]
Come on and join today

[00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:05.780]
And you'll be proud to say

[00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:08.880]
You're a member of the NRA

[00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:14.520]
Okay, 6 February 69 of Oats on a pool today without any

[00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:15.960]
I hate this pool on there

[00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:17.180]
Yeah, we got a shot of it

[00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:17.980]
What do you think?

[00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:18.720]
Nice

[00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:19.580]
You don't care, I forgot

[00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:20.400]
Oh, that's right

[00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:21.620]
You just refuse to care

[00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:22.240]
Right

[00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:24.200]
Let me just tell you about refusing to care

[00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:26.080]
If my friend Ricky is out there listening this morning

[00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:26.920]
I sure hope he is

[00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:29.260]
Just that I'll take any crap from any psychotic bitch

[00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:31.160]
That's my best advice

[00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:31.540]
Okay

[00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:33.580]
Don't waste one second of your life

[00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:35.240]
Especially when you're a young man

[00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:36.580]
Better to find out early

[00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:38.360]
Better to find out in the very early stages

[00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:39.680]
That whoever it is that you're all

[00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:43.140]
Hot and bothered about is some psychotic crazed bitch

[00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:46.120]
And just run the other direction just kiss the ground

[00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:47.800]
Kiss everything inside

[00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:49.720]
Man, kiss the table, kiss the ceiling

[00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:51.280]
Kiss the wall, kiss the turret

[00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:52.960]
That you will find out in the beginning

[00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:54.380]
Rather than later down the road

[00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:55.780]
Just ask George, he'll tell you

[00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:56.680]
A lot

[00:25:57.160 --> 00:25:58.440]
Yeah, over and over again

[00:25:58.440 --> 00:25:58.880]
Here you go Ricky

[00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:00.860]
Just consider for what it is

[00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:02.500]
A little bit advice from this old fact

[00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:05.380]
660, well he had a bad experience

[00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:06.780]
You know, Ricky, I realized

[00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:08.500]
I realized that whole thing about bad experiences

[00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:10.300]
We've got for guys with females, you know what's unusual

[00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:11.500]
But does he have kids?

[00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:12.900]
I couldn't say I don't have to worry about that

[00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:14.000]
Now that mom's in the ground

[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:14.780]
Does he have kids?

[00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:16.480]
Does who have kids?

[00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:16.800]
Ricky

[00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:18.700]
No, well then he's free

[00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:20.540]
He is free

[00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:22.360]
Fly, be free

[00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:24.660]
Thank your lucky stars

[00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:26.280]
That's right, kiss the ground man

[00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:28.100]
That's right, it looks bad right now

[00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:29.840]
But boy, when you look back and record your respect

[00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:31.880]
You'll say thank the Lord, thank

[00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:34.380]
I didn't get involved with that piece of crap

[00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:36.560]
Anyway, here's the poll today

[00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:37.660]
Something I claim to hate

[00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:39.240]
But secretly enjoy is

[00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:42.020]
masturbation seems to be winning 148 votes

[00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:43.500]
Hands down, ain't no secret

[00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:46.080]
The Jerry Springer Show 102

[00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:47.480]
I wonder about people who

[00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:50.340]
masturbate while watching the Jerry Springer Show

[00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:51.460]
Now that would be something that

[00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:53.400]
And with the Carpenters' music in the background

[00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:56.040]
Jerry Springer and the Carpenters are almost neck and neck

[00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:57.560]
And the two say the Jerry Springer Show

[00:26:57.560 --> 00:26:59.400]
100 say the Carpenters

[00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:03.740]
I bet you care, Karen wants that damn show on CNN over the weekend

[00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:07.180]
That Dr. Pupta, Sanjay Pupta, you know

[00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:08.320]
That Imjin guy?

[00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:10.480]
He didn't see it right?

[00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:12.060]
No, what?

[00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:15.380]
About long life and about this whole longevity thing

[00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:17.920]
And about taking supplements and about these operations

[00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:19.280]
They're doing and the research they're doing

[00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:21.840]
And they keep saying if you want to live long

[00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:24.840]
Longer, eat less

[00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:26.460]
Right, look at that

[00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:27.180]
You can go ahead and play that

[00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:28.300]
Didn't work for Karen to well

[00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:29.880]
In fact, she ain't even that one

[00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:31.660]
Didn't work out too well

[00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:35.620]
To eat, we've only just begun to eat

[00:27:35.620 --> 00:27:37.100]
To manja manja baby

[00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:40.280]
Yeah

[00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:42.420]
What a shame

[00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:43.980]
She was so sweet

[00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:45.140]
Warm and soothing

[00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:47.640]
Warm and soothing and very manly

[00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:49.780]
To his matter of fact, he had a very manly voice

[00:27:49.780 --> 00:27:51.480]
For all we know

[00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:54.760]
Anyway, the carpet is out of the carpet

[00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:56.300]
It doesn't bother me

[00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:57.940]
For all we know, there it is

[00:27:57.940 --> 00:27:58.780]
I just got through CNN

[00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:02.600]
Love look at the G.O.

[00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:04.080]
Isn't that how it starts out?

[00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:05.100]
It looks like he eat it

[00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:08.720]
Look at the 15

[00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:11.260]
He nailed it again

[00:28:11.260 --> 00:28:13.520]
Look at the two of us

[00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:15.580]
Nioh, of course, you know, she don't move too fast anymore

[00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:16.760]
So it's easy to nail Karen

[00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:18.980]
Okay, anyway, masturbation 150

[00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:20.140]
The carpet is 102

[00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:21.240]
Jerry Springer show 102

[00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:23.100]
It's the flat-footed tie right now

[00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:25.580]
And there's another stupid expression

[00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:26.840]
A flat-footed tie

[00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:27.960]
What does that mean?

[00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:28.900]
I don't know, somebody said

[00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:33.960]
Kneels pull 65

[00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:35.480]
Secretly into where my pull

[00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:37.940]
Fidilla ice cream 63

[00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:39.820]
Something I'm sorry

[00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:42.300]
If I live to be 3000, I just don't understand it

[00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:44.700]
And then if I live to be 3000, you won't get nothing for my will

[00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:49.060]
I think all week long we ought to talk about that about Nioh's will

[00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:50.520]
Okay

[00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:54.860]
I love that bit, everybody loves that bit

[00:28:54.860 --> 00:28:56.040]
Nice going chicken knife

[00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:58.520]
And you're right, I'm going to throw a little something there for him too

[00:28:58.520 --> 00:28:59.620]
He's going to need that

[00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:01.880]
Some oxygen, you know, those tubes don't come cheap

[00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:03.480]
Those what?

[00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:04.800]
Tube, yeah

[00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:07.120]
Vanilla ice cream 63

[00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:08.640]
Homosexuality 60

[00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:12.320]
Wow, I don't claim to hate it

[00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:14.500]
And I don't secretly enjoy it, I enjoy it

[00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:16.420]
Any time I can get it

[00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:18.060]
Country music 58

[00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:21.740]
Rap music 24, but that's way down there, rap music

[00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:24.320]
I wouldn't admit that in public who I was you, especially nowadays

[00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:28.400]
It's not acceptable to admit to be like a rap crap in public

[00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:30.440]
The Nioh Roger show 22

[00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:32.060]
They claim to hate it but they secretly enjoy it

[00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:34.240]
Unless you have a lot more, you're lying man

[00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:36.020]
You people, if I'm dying, you're lying

[00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:38.240]
Religion 16

[00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:42.300]
I claim to hate it, but I say

[00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:44.200]
Secretly enjoy it, what does that mean?

[00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:46.240]
They could have church in this guy

[00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:48.340]
They're rubbing their rosary beads a lot

[00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:51.460]
Or something, of course I can't say where they got their rosary beads hanging

[00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:54.280]
But you can use your imagination, hang down your head Tom Dooly

[00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:55.960]
Republicans 10

[00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:57.820]
Oh, I really enjoy them, yeah

[00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:00.480]
And Democrats on the list, they're so meant to say

[00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:02.480]
It's 678

[00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:05.540]
Well, I don't know, let's see, we get the 7 something by the top of the store

[00:30:05.540 --> 00:30:08.060]
I'm trying to figure whether we're going to go to $1,000

[00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:10.020]
I hate this pool free day ever

[00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:11.080]
Well, I won't say ever

[00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:14.860]
When we start doing that stupid, then when did I start doing that?

[00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:17.520]
I don't want to lump you in there, what's my doing?

[00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:18.960]
Do you hate this pool idea?

[00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:20.380]
Yeah, I don't know

[00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:23.280]
Maybe Eric can research it

[00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:25.560]
That would take a lot of research because they have to go back

[00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:29.640]
Through all, yeah, I'm sure he's got a search engine, then he can do it

[00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:30.640]
He's got a search engine

[00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:33.360]
Or is that search engine?

[00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:34.220]
Search engine

[00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:37.640]
683, I think we got a shot of the thousands

[00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:41.140]
This audience will come through for us, especially now that we got rid of those negative three people

[00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:46.060]
I hate this pool, I hate it, no matter what you say, I hate it

[00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:50.340]
Yeah, we hate you, okay, in fact, like I said before, South Florida could be a wonderful place

[00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:53.140]
All it needs is one thing, a people transplant

[00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:53.960]
That's all it needs

[00:30:56.680 --> 00:31:00.260]
And then the president is going to be there at Virginia Tech at Blacksburg today

[00:31:00.260 --> 00:31:00.820]
Isn't that wonderful?

[00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:03.340]
Well, you know, they pocket people of the NRA

[00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:07.620]
One of the worst gun-totten lunatics, gun-loving pieces of turd, that they say

[00:31:07.620 --> 00:31:10.060]
Oh, we'll have an office in the White House right next to the president

[00:31:10.060 --> 00:31:11.740]
Ha, ha, ha, ha, like that, you know

[00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:13.300]
He's going to show up there today

[00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:15.180]
For another photo opportunity

[00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:19.440]
To tell everybody how depressed and sad he is about all those dead young people

[00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:22.440]
Just like the 3300 dead young people in Iraq, Americans

[00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:23.100]
Court

[00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:25.460]
Judge Lawrence Cordo, presiding

[00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:30.420]
You've been sworn in, I've read your statements, and done two bingers of the kind

[00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:32.740]
Played a dude, what say you?

[00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:35.240]
The defendant dude, who I thought was my bro

[00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:37.520]
Snuff my last piece of pizza

[00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:42.100]
Well, defendant dude, that seems a gregiously harsh, what do you say in your defense?

[00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:47.620]
Uh, I totally spaced it, big famished after a marathon hacky sack session

[00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:51.340]
I've nostered hard, and then washed it down with a great phanta

[00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:53.440]
For that, I'm truly sorry

[00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:55.920]
You are guilty, then have shown remorse

[00:31:55.920 --> 00:32:01.340]
I rule the defendant shall buy the plaintiff dude a pizza with his choice of topping

[00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:01.980]
I am ZX!

[00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:04.740]
Wow, playing a dude on what grounds?

[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:08.040]
Um, on the grounds that I would also like fudgems

[00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:10.080]
Sustain, and those righteous

[00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:12.560]
So when's the stoner's court?

[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.280]
I will now return to chambers

[00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:16.380]
Place a rolled up towel under the door

[00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:19.160]
And research the case of zigzaggede joker

[00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:19.980]
Court is adjourned

[00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:23.280]
14 before I went at 5.60 WDQM

[00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:25.360]
So watch the story, a great video still playing her wide

[00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:27.940]
Yes sir, what do I tell you?

[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:28.920]
See, I knew you were full of crap

[00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:30.220]
41 years old, and he's still playing

[00:32:30.660 --> 00:32:31.720]
So what's the big deal with that?

[00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:33.680]
Not these guys, who's the one guy with the mess?

[00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:36.080]
What does his name mean? He's like 49 or something?

[00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:36.820]
Who's your franco?

[00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:38.440]
Is his head who it is?

[00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:41.120]
Francisco Franco, franco-american?

[00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:42.800]
Yeah, that's who it is

[00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:46.200]
He plays like once they've been on it, a paint cheater, whatever, once they're more live in the right

[00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:47.860]
They paint him, you know, he's like still alive

[00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:50.180]
Is he really 165?

[00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:52.900]
Well that's the way it is, you know, because it's a pansy game anyway

[00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:54.120]
Baseball, I don't want to say crap

[00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:57.400]
Watch a little bit of the Buffalo Islander game last night

[00:32:57.400 --> 00:33:02.600]
The guy that emailed me on my space while I was in hamster damn above being an islander fan

[00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:06.800]
And oh yeah, you can stick it man, are you a crazy person or what?

[00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:08.040]
I'm gonna root for the islanders?

[00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:10.060]
I was hoping they'd lose for a straight

[00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:11.540]
They didn't look out and win one game there

[00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:13.840]
But they're gonna get blown out in 5 by the sabers

[00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:15.840]
You kidding me? I'm gonna root for your islanders

[00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:17.340]
Who aids out the leaves for the playoffs?

[00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:18.960]
Are you a crazy person or what?

[00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:22.320]
Of course you are, schmuck

[00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:24.180]
I'm having me a great time in hamster damn

[00:33:24.180 --> 00:33:26.240]
I'm making some of this schmuck, this schmuckle

[00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:31.020]
It sends me a stupid ass, by the way speaking to emails, thanks to George

[00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:32.460]
Huh?

[00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:34.740]
What, you and I made Ricky chuck a little bit

[00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:36.640]
He's very depressed, he had this horrible experience

[00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:40.600]
Oh, Ricky, he was the same name

[00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:41.620]
Will you stop?

[00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:43.660]
I'll trade you, Ricky

[00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:46.060]
You'll trade one

[00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:47.660]
Delomas

[00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:48.860]
Oh, I see

[00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:50.540]
Yeah, when you're trapped

[00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:51.540]
Yeah

[00:33:51.540 --> 00:33:54.020]
Like you said, he doesn't have any kids on him

[00:33:54.020 --> 00:33:57.340]
I guess he would have liked to have been hitched to find out

[00:33:57.340 --> 00:33:58.740]
Hits were the bitch, not a good idea

[00:33:58.740 --> 00:34:00.140]
Yeah, no, don't do it

[00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:03.780]
Skip a happy tune, a whistle a happy tune

[00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:05.320]
Skip to the Lou, whatever

[00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:07.460]
Skip to Maloo, whatever that line means

[00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:12.120]
Speak in a skip and Eric, who was already working on your question before I even passed it along

[00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:17.200]
Yes, says, that the first appearance of I hate this poll was on December 4th, 05

[00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:21.940]
But wasn't on there regularly until February 27th, 06

[00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:26.200]
Also, it's only been about a year and a couple months change

[00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:29.920]
Eric is the best, yes sir, hello

[00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:31.340]
Hey Neil, how you doing?

[00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:34.840]
Okay, listen, this is the first time I've ever called you

[00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:37.180]
I was usually working in a truck all the time

[00:34:37.180 --> 00:34:40.640]
And, you know, doing a route down here in Florida

[00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:45.560]
Listen, I, listen for like 20 years

[00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:51.640]
I enjoy your show, I just wanted to call up and say, man, thank God you got the show going on

[00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:55.580]
Thank God, that's what I say every payday, man, thank God I get the show going on

[00:34:55.580 --> 00:34:57.660]
He keeps me entertained all day

[00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:00.800]
And the price is right, man, don't cost your dime

[00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:02.900]
So they're show going

[00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:08.880]
I listen all day long, so I just wanted to call and say, thank you, another thing

[00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:11.960]
You're my space page, you've got set the private

[00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:17.780]
And I'm, you know, not to eliterate on computers, so...

[00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:18.540]
To eliterate, right?

[00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:25.620]
You know, I eliterate all together, but I basically had my daughter make up my space page

[00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:31.260]
And I was trying to get back on your my space, but I can't get on there

[00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:34.460]
Because I don't know how it works, I guess you have to accept me right

[00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:38.280]
So, are you daughter and make a friend request, and if we like the way it looks and you make up a bunch of phone

[00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:39.300]
Your friends will put you on it

[00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:40.200]
Actually, I have a picture

[00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:46.560]
Don't send me one with no picture, because if there's no picture, I'll just delete it and me need to leave not soon

[00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:51.840]
I just... we can have a little bit of space on hand, so I just have to let her put my picture in there

[00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:52.880]
How old is your daughter?

[00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:54.680]
She's 23

[00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:57.940]
Well, that's right, I'm for all of you, that's the perfect of my space age

[00:35:59.380 --> 00:36:02.420]
I put my picture in her room, and then we'll definitely put it on

[00:36:02.420 --> 00:36:05.480]
I haven't gotten to be able to get on there yet, I'm gonna have to try to see if I can get on

[00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:09.140]
Well, get her on the case, okay, thanks a lot, Pally, you're killing me, have a great day

[00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:14.120]
707 on a pool, it's not even 11 o'clock yet, we're gonna make the thousand day in Spiderman Gale says

[00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:17.280]
Well, maybe we wouldn't make Gale there, we'll get all your people on the pool

[00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:21.920]
Get all Miguel's compadres from Chicago

[00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:26.080]
You're the only... I don't know, I guess there's quite a few Cuban people in Chicago

[00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:27.800]
Right now in Jersey, places like that

[00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:29.920]
We have cells everywhere, in case you didn't know

[00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:31.140]
Cells, that's right

[00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:36.340]
Hmm... I don't want to pull an eye mess now, they won't be in my bed

[00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:41.880]
Yeah, I wonder if they'd be able to get happy headed hose in themselves, and happy headed pimps

[00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:44.720]
We got all types, I'm gonna go take me a nice little mappy

[00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:51.740]
Oh, oh, America, man, in fact you know something?

[00:36:52.660 --> 00:36:55.980]
Corvidal, what perfect timing for this, because I would take a bunch of these other way, well I will

[00:36:56.780 --> 00:36:57.420]
WQAM, hello

[00:36:57.980 --> 00:36:59.400]
Hello? Yes sir

[00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:00.980]
Yes, is this Neil show?

[00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:02.340]
This is Neil, yes

[00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:04.960]
Oh, great, am I speaking to Neil?

[00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:06.460]
Yeah, it sounds like me, yes

[00:37:06.460 --> 00:37:10.260]
Hey, well I just wanted to thank you for your great program, man

[00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:12.860]
I've been listening to you for a lot of years, I've never called you

[00:37:13.340 --> 00:37:18.000]
And it is just wonderful to hear your... and I'm not kissing your behind

[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.140]
Go right ahead, I'm bending over right now, man

[00:37:20.860 --> 00:37:25.880]
I'm just telling you that your effectiveness is great, you really are a threat to fresh air in this market

[00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:30.500]
And it's nice to hear a voice of reason and sanity, and in other wise

[00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:36.100]
It's just a deplorable, horrible radio market in South Florida

[00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:38.220]
That's cool, yeah radio-sessful, man

[00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:46.440]
It is a cesspool, it's garbage, it's crap, but you know, you're reasoning and you're logic and your point of view is

[00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:52.600]
Not only I'm right with you on the same page, but I also know what you delivered, the humor is fantastic

[00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:54.480]
Yeah, I'm gonna work, man

[00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:56.700]
I'm legendary, just remember that, I'm legendary

[00:37:57.440 --> 00:37:59.400]
Well duh, I know that

[00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:03.220]
Okay, well thanks for the kissy kissy pal

[00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:06.520]
It's facts, man, you know, and ain't bragging when it's true, have a great day

[00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:07.900]
Thank you so much, and you too

[00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:10.160]
How you like that, boy, they love me now

[00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:15.060]
I think after I went on vacation for that, we thought, it's not a knock on you, although it probably is

[00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:21.140]
But, you know, and let me also say this, because I was the one who said against all odds

[00:38:21.140 --> 00:38:24.840]
When I kept trying to push those awful vacation tapes on, best of me, I'll say this

[00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:30.300]
And he kept playing it poorly, put together much as swell, garbage that nobody wanted to hear the first time

[00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:34.820]
And I said, put your Johnny here when I'm on vacation, and George said, what?

[00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:37.540]
Remember that? Yeah, you couldn't believe it, after I filled my name

[00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:38.840]
Even you couldn't believe it, I couldn't

[00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:45.900]
I nearly, I nearly, I really, I really, what have you been doing lately?

[00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:46.920]
Really? Yeah

[00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:54.820]
And I saw I take up, but anyway, I'm gone for a week and all of a sudden they say, oh, hallelujah baby, Neil is back

[00:38:54.820 --> 00:39:00.620]
The old queen, the legendary queen is back under radio, see all your people I want to knock and rip it, they bother me at all

[00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:05.600]
I have no foreskin and I have no thin skin, how do you like that? I have thick skin

[00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:08.820]
Of course, when you're this fat, you've got to have thick skin

[00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:10.660]
But what? Well, the thick skin, because it's trache

[00:39:11.060 --> 00:39:14.640]
Groove it all, writes, hailing farewell to the end of the American Empire, it's short

[00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:17.100]
And it's right to the point

[00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:23.940]
Whenever the New York Times finally gets the point to what is going on in our native land, a celestial choir can be heard in Times Square

[00:39:23.940 --> 00:39:25.380]
Shouting Hosanna's

[00:39:25.940 --> 00:39:34.300]
This happened recently on April 14 when they realized that there could be a dark explanation for what W is doing when he sends a Mr. Boltman, a UN Hater, to be invested to that body

[00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:39.000]
Or a Mr. Wolfowitz to the World Bank, a man is ignorant of history and finances the president himself

[00:39:39.740 --> 00:39:45.300]
Marine doubt in the Times was allowed to set the pitch for the latest revelations, with her more con than Neohydline

[00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:52.140]
Meanwhile hundreds, perhaps thousands of incompetence are not cluttering the Justice Department while known incompetence are in place to wreck from within regulatory systems

[00:39:52.140 --> 00:39:54.600]
And even mighty water-read hospital itself

[00:39:55.120 --> 00:40:02.520]
And that's such investigations that W is cut back, especially at the head of the Pett food investigation, a matter of such passionate interest to our countrymen

[00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:13.780]
Needless to say, the Times instinctively probe Bush as it is too, as it too is an inept creature of our Leviathan master, corporate America

[00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:19.240]
See, I can't keep up with Krovedal, not even in the same planet as he is

[00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:28.160]
But though the Times don't know it's a mysterious problem with Bush's general relations to the outside world, the Times as usual cannot grasp what so many of his fans of the American Republican CISO clearly

[00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:37.020]
And the name of Maniki and religious cult, he is eager to destroy every last trace of the New Deal, privatized social security by destroying both the state and its global Imperium

[00:40:37.700 --> 00:40:44.160]
W is love of torture and the death penalty suggests that this is colligular redux, but actually he is a homegrown, ruminous Augustus

[00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:51.140]
The last Roman Emperor is viewed by the Swiss playwright, Fragric, something or other, and refashioned by me in an English version that played on Broadway in the 60s

[00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:58.740]
As the play opens, the Northern barbarians are closing in on Rome while the Emperor doggles and electing to appoint a war-zar to defend the city itself

[00:40:58.740 --> 00:41:08.320]
What is wrong with him? Well, he does have a plan, when Odocair, the king of the two-tons arrives, Rhymealus expects to be executed, but Odocair is that how you say that? Also, rise a plan, good enough

[00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:16.120]
The two rulers will unite in a realm of peace, Rhymealus then admits that all his actions and non-actions had a single end that is struck to the bloody Empire hate inherited

[00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:19.580]
For the admiring two-tons, he holds up an imaginary globe

[00:41:19.580 --> 00:41:22.220]
Now watch, he says, as the Emperor dissolves his empire

[00:41:22.220 --> 00:41:28.600]
Look all, if he wants more upon this tainted globe, this dream of a great empire, floating in space driven by the slightest breath of my lips

[00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:33.300]
Yes, look once more upon the far-flung lands and circling the blue sea with its dancing dolphins

[00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:37.400]
These rich provinces golden with wheat, these teeming cities overflowing with life

[00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:41.740]
Yes, the empire was once the sun, warming mankind, but at a zenith it scorched the world

[00:41:41.740 --> 00:41:47.300]
Now it is a harmless bubble, and in the hands of the Emperor dissolves it into nothing, and thus the throne of blood is overturned

[00:41:48.660 --> 00:41:55.720]
Obviously our weird little Emperor is incapable of moral reflection, thus inviting us to reflect morally upon him as he's gone about his systematic wrecking of our common empire

[00:41:55.720 --> 00:42:01.620]
Which after 1945 should have come into its own but thanks to Truman at all, it stayed forever at war and but now the Hark

[00:42:01.620 --> 00:42:09.680]
What is the timescores singing now? Can it be a new weekend edition? Without troubling news or as W. Finally snapped our military machine for fun if not global peace

[00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:13.660]
On a high moral ground, Rhymerus, and the Great Disowned is empire

[00:42:13.660 --> 00:42:22.520]
W. The Minister, driven by ignorance and greed like his cronies, leaves us defenseless and at sea in a terrorized world of prisons, phonety, trials, renditions, executions without due process of law

[00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:26.620]
while leaving the Middle East a vast tunnel house which he likes to call a fledgling democracy

[00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:32.640]
At the end of the Broadway play one Roman soldier played by Robert Duval, eager to save Rome, joins Rhymerus

[00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:42.720]
But Rhymerus tells him that Roman empire has been dissolved, as surely as W. is dissolving us as hurricanes, tempests, droughts it is making, ravage our alabaster cities and amber waves of grain

[00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:46.080]
How do you like that?

[00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:51.760]
I read five or ten of the words right. Well that's Groved Alman, he's an intellectual, I'm just a fat or a fag

[00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:53.360]
This is the Neal Roger show

[00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:56.080]
This is your brain

[00:42:58.080 --> 00:42:59.060]
What's all the questions?

[00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:19.780]
Right, go on a bender, wear it big hats and funny suspenders

[00:43:20.620 --> 00:43:25.080]
The back home is a different world, no phone so you can't call girls

[00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:30.040]
Come on, come on and raise that barn, they can't swear they can't just say, don't you, Nian?

[00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:35.620]
If you miss it, simply these kids, they can't say the same cause they're Amish in the city

[00:43:35.620 --> 00:43:37.900]
Cause they're Amish in the city

[00:43:38.580 --> 00:43:42.820]
No more eating only mutton, they can use zippers instead of buttons

[00:43:42.820 --> 00:43:47.400]
First time seeing a computer, going for lunch at a place called Looters

[00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:52.340]
Cars honned, never heard street noise and it's the first time they've ever seen a homeboy

[00:43:52.340 --> 00:43:57.240]
The back home is a different thing, no tattoos or belly rings

[00:43:57.240 --> 00:43:59.400]
Come on, come on and feel no guilt

[00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:02.240]
When you get home you can finish that quilt L.A.

[00:44:02.500 --> 00:44:07.820]
The place is so pretty if they say, how will they survive when they're Amish in the city?

[00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:10.120]
When they're Amish in the city

[00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:18.740]
Even the Amishers shoot each other, remember that?

[00:44:18.980 --> 00:44:22.300]
Not that many months ago, that was a great time, they did not shoot anyone

[00:44:22.820 --> 00:44:24.600]
Well, they got shot

[00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:31.140]
Well, whatever, there's the picture of the show on CNN that better watch myself

[00:44:31.140 --> 00:44:35.280]
The North Korean gentleman, yes, that slime ball

[00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:40.820]
The person of interest, Shosun Hui 23, who always me and he's ugly as hell

[00:44:40.820 --> 00:44:42.000]
So at least he was, he's dead now

[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:44.120]
I bet you don't look even that good right now

[00:44:46.300 --> 00:44:49.620]
729 votes on the pool and of course, you know, everybody's going to want to start up again

[00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:53.500]
And gun control, it's like when the horse is out of the barn

[00:44:53.500 --> 00:44:55.040]
That's right, the genie's out of the bottle

[00:44:55.040 --> 00:45:00.380]
A million miles down the road and saying, hey, we better go out and batten down the hatches

[00:45:00.380 --> 00:45:03.180]
And the barn horse is going to get loose, you know?

[00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:04.280]
Kind of like that

[00:45:04.820 --> 00:45:09.080]
An addition to which most of you people are so brainwashed in the thinking that this is the way the real world operates

[00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:12.700]
With everybody owning guns, oh, they're not going to take away my guns

[00:45:13.820 --> 00:45:17.920]
Shosun, they take away, if they take away our guns, got only knows what the government's going to do then

[00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:22.200]
Right, like we trust this government now, with all the guns you got, who the hell are you?

[00:45:22.340 --> 00:45:25.060]
Can, they'll squash you like a bug, and then they're the engines

[00:45:27.340 --> 00:45:29.100]
Are you still with that default crap again?

[00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:29.800]
We've got a gun killer

[00:45:30.180 --> 00:45:32.020]
Jesus, God, I thought we got rid of his ass

[00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:35.180]
You know, that's one thing, you never hear about him at all

[00:45:35.180 --> 00:45:37.500]
Is he still on the image, or is he still like this?

[00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:38.640]
He's not going to go out and batten down the hatches

[00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:39.000]
He is?

[00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:40.280]
Yep

[00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:42.040]
Boy, sure, he's one of the best kept secrets

[00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:42.660]
Where's he going?

[00:45:42.980 --> 00:45:44.740]
Of course, QAM is also one of the best kept secrets

[00:45:44.740 --> 00:45:46.540]
Thank you, Joe Bell, for the tremendous promotion

[00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:50.920]
And since our promotion is director of sitting right there in a chair and just open up a mouth a moment ago

[00:45:50.920 --> 00:45:53.800]
What, what have they got in mind for any promotion any time this century?

[00:45:53.800 --> 00:45:54.400]
Anything at all?

[00:45:54.540 --> 00:45:57.600]
We're just going to see if we can get a time to about a 0.2

[00:45:58.600 --> 00:46:00.640]
Well, we've got to hit the bottom first and then we'll go from there

[00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:03.640]
Oh, I've got news for you. We've got some day parts that are...

[00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:06.840]
We talk about the Titanic, the barnacles are even embarrassed

[00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:08.760]
They're scraping right along the bottom, baby

[00:46:08.760 --> 00:46:10.160]
Right along the bottom of your...

[00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:11.220]
Brack, though, simply ass

[00:46:12.300 --> 00:46:16.400]
730 votes, now let's see if we can get about eight something by noon, eight, uh, whatever

[00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:18.280]
We should be okay for a thousand

[00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:21.380]
I wouldn't have to be a feather in my old camp

[00:46:21.380 --> 00:46:22.740]
Uh, in your what?

[00:46:23.660 --> 00:46:26.640]
A feather in my sock if I wore any, which I won't, and I don't

[00:46:28.740 --> 00:46:29.540]
730 votes

[00:46:29.540 --> 00:46:33.200]
Now this is the first day, what did you say December of 06?

[00:46:34.120 --> 00:46:38.440]
December of 05 was the first occasion but regularly February of 06

[00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:40.080]
So what you said?

[00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:41.480]
Oh, yeah, what you said

[00:46:43.420 --> 00:46:43.860]
Sorry

[00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:46.740]
I'm going to rework my will right now

[00:46:48.620 --> 00:46:49.500]
30 votes

[00:46:49.500 --> 00:46:52.940]
Yeah, George, before the show this morning George begged me to put money in my will form

[00:46:54.320 --> 00:46:55.200]
Oh, bleeeeeee

[00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:58.340]
And then he said put a little bit in there open chicken act for not too much

[00:46:58.340 --> 00:47:01.580]
And don't take chicken act out of my cut is what he said, that's right

[00:47:01.580 --> 00:47:04.340]
That I don't care if I'm going to die of lung cancer

[00:47:05.100 --> 00:47:06.460]
He can suck oxygen

[00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:08.780]
Yeah, no comment

[00:47:10.140 --> 00:47:14.540]
Something I claim to hate but secretly enjoy that's our poll today, 730 vote

[00:47:14.540 --> 00:47:17.520]
Let me click that view current thing because that's really nifty the way that works

[00:47:18.020 --> 00:47:19.060]
733, you see that?

[00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:20.740]
A little chunk came in there right there

[00:47:20.740 --> 00:47:23.240]
Little chunk, little chunk smells really nasty

[00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:25.020]
Smells like it came from hamster damn

[00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:28.940]
733, masturbation 164

[00:47:28.940 --> 00:47:31.080]
The carpenters 109

[00:47:31.660 --> 00:47:35.380]
There is absolutely nothing like masturbating while listening to Karen Carpenter

[00:47:35.380 --> 00:47:36.640]
Ooh, what a good idea

[00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:39.820]
Jerry Springer show 109, Niels Pools 69

[00:47:39.820 --> 00:47:41.060]
Just let's move right along

[00:47:41.060 --> 00:47:41.820]
Come with the genius

[00:47:41.820 --> 00:47:46.280]
Didn't need any embellishment, any explanation, any uh, Niels Pools

[00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:47.280]
How about the world I think?

[00:47:47.340 --> 00:47:49.420]
Vanilla ice cream 68

[00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:51.980]
Oh yeah, top of the world I like that

[00:47:51.980 --> 00:47:54.260]
That's pretty corny, pretty syrupy

[00:47:54.260 --> 00:47:56.460]
It's kind of like saccharin as a matter of fact

[00:47:56.860 --> 00:47:58.320]
It's like got sorbrecht all in it

[00:47:58.320 --> 00:48:00.740]
I think let's do it for about half an hour you'll be your brain's up

[00:48:02.060 --> 00:48:03.160]
What happened to it?

[00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:04.020]
It's coming, here it comes

[00:48:04.020 --> 00:48:04.380]
Oh

[00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:08.440]
Every year or something, whatever, to me, okay

[00:48:08.440 --> 00:48:09.700]
No, the last time I did it was to you

[00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:18.120]
Or if you don't sound like a guy, and don't get me wrong, I love you

[00:48:18.120 --> 00:48:19.400]
But she sounds just like a guy

[00:48:20.040 --> 00:48:22.300]
She could get those real low notes

[00:48:23.640 --> 00:48:26.420]
She's no man-murray, but that's correct

[00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:31.000]
Hmm, well you sure got a lot of Carpenter's all of this

[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:32.400]
Play the carnival I got on

[00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:33.240]
Really?

[00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:33.880]
Oh yeah

[00:48:34.620 --> 00:48:36.980]
You got beachwood 45789

[00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:40.400]
Or how about please Mr. Postman?

[00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:43.600]
Wow

[00:48:43.600 --> 00:48:46.800]
I see how many I don't like this

[00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:51.760]
I don't mind that, even though of course it's no more for less

[00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:52.840]
But I don't mind that at all

[00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:55.980]
It's a great song, by the way, please Mr. Postman

[00:48:55.980 --> 00:49:01.700]
Yes, it is

[00:49:01.700 --> 00:49:06.460]
The new I-screen 68, country music 66, homosexuality 63

[00:49:06.460 --> 00:49:08.360]
They claim to hate it but they really enjoyed it

[00:49:08.360 --> 00:49:10.320]
They're a lovin it, believe me, they love it

[00:49:10.320 --> 00:49:14.220]
Rap music 26, the new Roger Show 22

[00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:17.320]
They claim to hate it but they secretly enjoy it

[00:49:17.320 --> 00:49:21.520]
See that's a lie, you know, it should have like another digit in front of it, you have like 820

[00:49:22.380 --> 00:49:26.640]
It's a lie, we got more closet people out there of every variety, you know

[00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:31.260]
Religion 18, oh I love religion, I just don't want to let you know about it

[00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:35.240]
My rule has taught, but the mice these are all over the place

[00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:38.320]
What's the next holiday we got coming up?

[00:49:38.600 --> 00:49:39.780]
To your Gentiles

[00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:42.400]
Either one, one's Tisha Bob

[00:49:44.100 --> 00:49:45.240]
I don't know, I got that

[00:49:45.240 --> 00:49:48.340]
Brother, I guess one, I got that calendar, my pile right here

[00:49:48.340 --> 00:49:49.400]
Just, you see that?

[00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:53.740]
So I'm not gonna why I ask these, here it is, the Jewish calendar right here

[00:49:53.740 --> 00:49:57.360]
The next holiday we got coming out that we finally got peace off in the back

[00:49:57.360 --> 00:49:59.840]
Oh Sunday April 15th, we just had it

[00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:00.800]
Oh, yum please

[00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:01.320]
Was it yum?

[00:50:01.960 --> 00:50:02.760]
Yum ha sure

[00:50:04.040 --> 00:50:05.360]
You know what we have to say to that?

[00:50:05.720 --> 00:50:06.120]
Oy

[00:50:06.120 --> 00:50:07.380]
Yum ha sure

[00:50:07.380 --> 00:50:07.920]
Oy!

[00:50:08.100 --> 00:50:09.040]
Let me show you this

[00:50:09.040 --> 00:50:10.840]
Then we got yum ha sure

[00:50:10.840 --> 00:50:14.220]
Now it's on Monday April 23rd, next Monday

[00:50:14.220 --> 00:50:15.080]
Oh I'm thinking about...

[00:50:15.080 --> 00:50:18.400]
I have a omur on Sunday May 6th, lag boom, or did he play for a red socks?

[00:50:19.340 --> 00:50:22.240]
Yum, you're Ruchaliam on Wednesday May 16th

[00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:26.360]
Shavuas, I'll write my favorite Shavuas, I don't know what it's all about, but I love saying it

[00:50:26.360 --> 00:50:29.760]
Happy Shavuas, Wednesday and Thursday May 23rd and 24th

[00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:31.740]
And I'm sure we got some for the volume coming up too now

[00:50:32.440 --> 00:50:36.160]
I don't think the volume have any more holidays to our Christmas holiday

[00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:38.160]
No, seriously till Christmas

[00:50:39.640 --> 00:50:40.760]
Mother's Day, my ass

[00:50:42.460 --> 00:50:43.480]
I'm taking that off

[00:50:43.480 --> 00:50:45.920]
Is there another Christian holiday between now and Christmas?

[00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:48.900]
If there is, I sure would like to know what it is so I can be sure and take off on it

[00:50:49.900 --> 00:50:50.580]
Nothing I know

[00:50:50.980 --> 00:50:51.960]
No, thanks given

[00:50:51.960 --> 00:50:54.960]
See, one thing about the Jews, thanks give me that a goiish or a holiday

[00:50:54.960 --> 00:50:57.240]
Even the Jews can have the churches they get

[00:50:57.240 --> 00:50:58.280]
It is not

[00:50:58.280 --> 00:50:59.740]
You tell me the pilgrims were going?

[00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:00.740]
Oh

[00:51:01.800 --> 00:51:02.480]
What was that?

[00:51:02.940 --> 00:51:03.240]
Top of the world

[00:51:03.240 --> 00:51:04.220]
So yeah, the pilgrims were

[00:51:04.220 --> 00:51:06.900]
Are you kidding with those buckle pilgrims were not going?

[00:51:06.900 --> 00:51:08.000]
They were just happy dresses

[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:10.000]
They were just Jews with good outfits

[00:51:10.560 --> 00:51:14.100]
Religion 18, Republicans 12 and Democrats 7 and other 744

[00:51:14.500 --> 00:51:17.880]
And when I click that view current it just, oh I get 748

[00:51:17.880 --> 00:51:19.880]
See that nice chunk that came in around that shot?

[00:51:21.260 --> 00:51:24.400]
President Bush speaks in Virginia Tech Convocation to a clock of staff

[00:51:24.860 --> 00:51:26.820]
Noobman Dread is what they ought to be saying, okay?

[00:51:27.400 --> 00:51:29.300]
Gun Totten, Gun Love and lunatic

[00:51:30.300 --> 00:51:32.980]
Who is just as much responsible for what happened there yesterday

[00:51:32.980 --> 00:51:33.800]
Is anybody else?

[00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:35.120]
Is anybody else who supports?

[00:51:35.120 --> 00:51:38.020]
See, I don't want to go off on a big rant about this but I might

[00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:40.380]
Just having returned from hamster dam

[00:51:42.600 --> 00:51:47.280]
And there will be some of you people say, oh well I've been there and there's a bunch of drug crazed people

[00:51:48.020 --> 00:51:50.580]
Arostas in the street there and all this other stuff going on

[00:51:50.580 --> 00:51:52.360]
And all this hanky, spanky and stuff

[00:51:52.360 --> 00:51:53.060]
You know what?

[00:51:54.220 --> 00:51:55.260]
Light years ahead

[00:51:55.260 --> 00:51:58.400]
Even though the buildings are old and the food sucks

[00:51:59.340 --> 00:52:00.500]
They are light years ahead

[00:52:00.500 --> 00:52:04.460]
Of course Canada, my God, we're talking the Canada is like in the 25th century compared to America

[00:52:04.460 --> 00:52:06.740]
What do you people talk about? What do you think it about?

[00:52:07.300 --> 00:52:11.880]
That you can't go out and walk the streets because some crazy bastards got a gun and gonna blow your crap away

[00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:14.200]
If you got five bucks in your pocket or 50 cent

[00:52:15.380 --> 00:52:18.300]
Or maybe if you look at them cross-eyed or if you take the wrong parking spot

[00:52:18.300 --> 00:52:20.240]
But I'm saying, that's how it goes in America

[00:52:20.240 --> 00:52:24.900]
The civilized world does not operate that way because civilized people don't run around with guns

[00:52:24.900 --> 00:52:27.080]
The big gun will be a nice side, please

[00:52:27.080 --> 00:52:27.800]
That's right

[00:52:28.380 --> 00:52:29.700]
That's how it works in America

[00:52:29.700 --> 00:52:30.160]
What?

[00:52:30.620 --> 00:52:32.040]
You said 50 cents, it got me going

[00:52:32.040 --> 00:52:32.740]
50 cents

[00:52:32.740 --> 00:52:34.600]
Say it right man, 50 cents

[00:52:35.460 --> 00:52:38.020]
I'm as hip as they come on the hipster just like the mold my foot

[00:52:38.440 --> 00:52:40.520]
I'm an ancient hipster, a ding dong daddy man

[00:52:40.520 --> 00:52:42.280]
That's right, I'm doing an ancient style

[00:52:42.280 --> 00:52:42.880]
I'm a huff-huff-huff

[00:52:42.880 --> 00:52:44.760]
I like ancient styles

[00:52:46.060 --> 00:52:46.900]
748 and a pole

[00:52:48.220 --> 00:52:50.880]
You're gonna get me going out, you're gonna get me an honest fear pretty soon

[00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:53.900]
I'm gonna start off out, I'm gonna start off out

[00:52:53.900 --> 00:52:54.760]
That's what I say

[00:52:55.460 --> 00:52:55.820]
Facts

[00:52:56.920 --> 00:52:57.280]
Fui

[00:52:58.140 --> 00:52:58.500]
Act

[00:53:00.300 --> 00:53:01.760]
752 on the pole by the way

[00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:05.960]
What are we trying to get? We're trying to get like about 825, 850 just to cover our ass by noon

[00:53:06.700 --> 00:53:10.300]
See Miguel, you're sitting in the chair there, you're supposed to be keeping track of this kind of stuff

[00:53:10.300 --> 00:53:13.480]
Oh, okay, you're supposed to pretend to care like Chris does

[00:53:14.960 --> 00:53:17.740]
The only thing Chris cares about is getting his free lunch every day

[00:53:17.740 --> 00:53:22.060]
And if I was making a kind of nickels and dimes that he's making, 50 cents

[00:53:23.220 --> 00:53:24.400]
That's all I care about too

[00:53:24.400 --> 00:53:27.000]
Because I couldn't afford to buy my own lunch if I was making what they're paying him

[00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:29.160]
He does okay, he's a good guy, he is a good guy

[00:53:29.780 --> 00:53:32.740]
I'm not saying he's great, he's no Josh, but then again he just started

[00:53:32.740 --> 00:53:34.780]
He's only been out here since literally in the year, right?

[00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:36.760]
Right, so as we get some weight off of him

[00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:38.060]
Weight off his ass

[00:53:38.060 --> 00:53:40.120]
That's the nice thing that Joe building for us, you know

[00:53:40.120 --> 00:53:45.660]
Stole Josh Curtis away who was becoming so popular that he was like in great demand even on my space

[00:53:45.660 --> 00:53:46.040]
That's right

[00:53:47.020 --> 00:53:48.800]
Unfortunately, it was all the guys that were after his ass

[00:53:48.800 --> 00:53:51.840]
But they know as far as chicks are concerned, he's got their Russian girlfriend with all the vodka

[00:53:51.840 --> 00:53:53.800]
And the big boobies and stuff like that

[00:53:53.800 --> 00:53:54.420]
Huge

[00:53:54.900 --> 00:53:55.340]
Really?

[00:53:55.460 --> 00:53:56.540]
The freaking phenomenal

[00:53:56.540 --> 00:54:00.260]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

[00:54:00.260 --> 00:54:00.460]
Oh

[00:54:01.160 --> 00:54:02.900]
Maybe that's what they want

[00:54:02.900 --> 00:54:06.880]
Maybe that's what your friend Christopher was trying to get to is get to hear through him, you know what I mean?

[00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:07.240]
Maybe

[00:54:07.240 --> 00:54:08.720]
Remember Christopher who was a fandom?

[00:54:09.040 --> 00:54:09.160]
Who?

[00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:13.260]
Christopher aka some other people, several other phony people on there

[00:54:13.820 --> 00:54:19.840]
Well I'm sure glad that we put a little smile on Ricky's face there after he got Ricky and your lucky nasty bitch

[00:54:19.840 --> 00:54:22.480]
Yeah, consider yourself lucky, do a cartwheel

[00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:26.740]
If you don't know how it's even to say you know when people are depressed and they're down in the dumps

[00:54:26.740 --> 00:54:28.860]
And they feel like they've been screwed over and stuff like that

[00:54:28.860 --> 00:54:32.720]
It's one thing to go all the way over there the West Coast to get screwed but to get screwed over that's another story

[00:54:32.720 --> 00:54:34.320]
No boy, nobody had in mind

[00:54:34.660 --> 00:54:35.840]
We're thinking about your kiddo

[00:54:36.420 --> 00:54:38.260]
I don't want to tell you what we're thinking but we're thinking

[00:54:38.840 --> 00:54:43.260]
750-3-07-a-pool I'm going to keep you really tight in on that because we could talk about that

[00:54:43.260 --> 00:54:46.100]
And we could keep talking about the 32 innocent people who died

[00:54:46.100 --> 00:54:49.980]
And Virginia Secchess today and why they died and why nothing is going to happen to change it

[00:54:49.980 --> 00:54:51.760]
And my most people don't give a crap anymore

[00:54:51.760 --> 00:54:53.040]
Get a lot of people

[00:54:53.880 --> 00:54:54.360]
Five

[00:54:54.360 --> 00:54:58.720]
Sixth of the Rogers on Sports Hole Radio WQA

[00:55:02.640 --> 00:55:06.560]

[00:55:07.100 --> 00:55:07.440]
You will

[00:55:07.440 --> 00:55:12.280]
Sport Hole Radio 560 WQA invite you to listen and win

[00:55:15.580 --> 00:55:20.460]
Simply cut and pay someone else's profile and take to my space or in 50 words or less

[00:55:20.460 --> 00:55:26.380]
Right why you should be a Niels Wheel on the back of the postcard and run to the WQAM Stimbiose in the McAllister hotel

[00:55:26.380 --> 00:55:28.520]
Then when you hear this sound

[00:55:29.400 --> 00:55:34.020]
That's your chance to win Harris Millions or have to even fill you the dollar

[00:55:34.020 --> 00:55:37.480]
It's a dollar, it's a dollar, it's a dollar, it's a dollar

[00:55:37.480 --> 00:55:42.100]
O contestants must be male, no younger than 18, no older than 25, must be shaving and smooth

[00:55:42.100 --> 00:55:47.200]
Judges reserved the right to eliminate contestants based on the rate equitance and the already rate and scale of 1 to 10

[00:55:47.200 --> 00:55:50.520]
Runners I will receive an autographed duplicate of Niels Wheel suitable for training

[00:55:50.520 --> 00:55:54.880]
And the duplicates of Niels Wheel found under your windshield wiper in the parking lot will be foited by law

[00:55:54.880 --> 00:55:59.200]
All prizes will be awarded by my Anthony and the grand prize winners are asked to be patient for it

[00:55:59.200 --> 00:56:01.580]
And a period of time until Niels decides to die

[00:56:01.580 --> 00:56:04.920]
Well listen I'm not going to die any time today so what I'm going to do is leave right now

[00:56:04.920 --> 00:56:08.880]
I'm going to take all the money out of God, I'm going to take $1,000, I'm going to go out and have me a great time

[00:56:08.880 --> 00:56:09.540]
I'll be there to go

[00:56:09.540 --> 00:56:14.700]
That sound like a plan, just wrap the $100 bills on you, just stick them to your body and wear them as clothes

[00:56:15.080 --> 00:56:15.400]
Huh?

[00:56:16.060 --> 00:56:18.620]
Yeah, I want some good peels off, one by one

[00:56:18.620 --> 00:56:19.320]
You can get peels

[00:56:19.320 --> 00:56:21.080]
You know what tomorrow is, don't you?

[00:56:21.180 --> 00:56:21.880]
We'd buy one today

[00:56:21.880 --> 00:56:22.740]
That is correct

[00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:25.560]
And of course the audience is probably wondering

[00:56:25.560 --> 00:56:29.200]
And don't forget they got this slide open at Pompedon Island as of this past weekend

[00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:32.700]
Too bad that they're not sending me any information to put on the record for 30 years of

[00:56:33.260 --> 00:56:33.580]
Whatever

[00:56:34.640 --> 00:56:37.620]
But the slots are open in Pompedon Park, I just don't know what I'm going to mention now

[00:56:38.040 --> 00:56:41.920]
So you know next time if I ever come down here again, how much I just go there and punch my guts there too

[00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:43.680]
As a matter of fact spread it around a little bit

[00:56:44.900 --> 00:56:47.900]
Spread it around, if you got it spread it and the money too

[00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:49.700]
Is that what they say?

[00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:51.080]
I told her

[00:56:51.920 --> 00:56:54.060]
Oh God, WNQAM, hello

[00:56:54.640 --> 00:56:55.900]
Niels, how you doing? Welcome back

[00:56:55.900 --> 00:56:57.160]
Great, thank you so much

[00:56:57.160 --> 00:56:58.420]
A couple things

[00:56:59.060 --> 00:57:02.000]
I've been through some polling and of high school students

[00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:05.420]
And a lot of them want to be involved in the election process

[00:57:05.880 --> 00:57:07.940]
Like 16, 17 year olds

[00:57:08.660 --> 00:57:11.480]
What do you mean you've been doing a lot of polling of high school students

[00:57:11.480 --> 00:57:13.540]
Where has this been on street corners? I don't get it

[00:57:13.540 --> 00:57:15.200]
Talk to her looking for them

[00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:15.960]
It's about the random

[00:57:16.660 --> 00:57:18.340]
Like referendum, you know what I mean?

[00:57:18.500 --> 00:57:25.800]
It's giving these different high schools papers to fill out for their students to get involved in the election process

[00:57:27.060 --> 00:57:31.000]
How do they get involved when they're 16 and 17 years old like casting phony votes?

[00:57:31.180 --> 00:57:34.540]
No, I've been trying to get the legislative to change the law

[00:57:34.540 --> 00:57:36.260]
To change what law?

[00:57:36.580 --> 00:57:37.900]
The voting law of 18

[00:57:38.640 --> 00:57:47.580]
To what? 15, 10, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, get out of here, you nut job, you pedophile man

[00:57:47.580 --> 00:57:52.160]
He's just looking for an excuse to go out there and grab onto some asses

[00:57:52.160 --> 00:57:52.900]
What he wants

[00:57:53.940 --> 00:57:55.460]
Polling high school students

[00:57:55.460 --> 00:57:57.100]
That's right, I'm sure he is

[00:57:57.100 --> 00:57:58.220]
Right referendum

[00:57:58.900 --> 00:58:00.920]
760, 760 WGR Detroit

[00:58:00.920 --> 00:58:02.800]
Boy, it used to be a great radio, I've never really was

[00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:04.760]
They had the Tigreiums alone with her near Harwell

[00:58:06.240 --> 00:58:08.880]
Long time ago, man, when a radio business was worthwhile

[00:58:08.880 --> 00:58:11.340]
Let me just say it again, radio is dead

[00:58:11.900 --> 00:58:14.440]
Okay, get over it, it's dead, done, finished

[00:58:16.320 --> 00:58:20.960]
Done, true, audios, word ghost, finito, bonito

[00:58:21.660 --> 00:58:24.500]
I'll read the d'Arch, totesienes, dooi

[00:58:25.420 --> 00:58:28.080]
What is the picture of that North Korean guy again?

[00:58:28.160 --> 00:58:29.360]
We don't want to start picking on North Koreans

[00:58:30.040 --> 00:58:34.480]
And I'm going to tell you the first person that comes on the year anywhere in America says, gook, he's done

[00:58:34.480 --> 00:58:35.420]
I'm telling you that right now

[00:58:36.260 --> 00:58:36.880]
Am I right?

[00:58:37.700 --> 00:58:38.000]
Yep

[00:58:38.660 --> 00:58:40.280]
They'll throw the book at him

[00:58:40.740 --> 00:58:41.340]
The book?

[00:58:42.280 --> 00:58:43.240]
Yes, the book

[00:58:44.720 --> 00:58:46.020]
You just know it's going to happen

[00:58:46.780 --> 00:58:49.640]
Because they're going to try to out- I'mist, I'mist, then they're going to want to begin in can

[00:58:49.640 --> 00:58:51.680]
And they're not going to have all the millions and all that's to back him up

[00:58:51.680 --> 00:58:53.000]
Like that old drunk is God

[00:58:54.580 --> 00:58:57.000]
No, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing- like that

[00:58:58.300 --> 00:59:03.280]
And when I heard, I think it was Kenny this morning say something about Amist was making $7 million a year

[00:59:03.740 --> 00:59:05.960]
$7 million a year for a dead man to be sitting in the chair

[00:59:05.960 --> 00:59:07.500]
I'll take that job right now

[00:59:08.600 --> 00:59:09.920]
I can chew gum and mumble

[00:59:10.440 --> 00:59:12.540]
I don't have any gum right now, but I can go get some

[00:59:12.540 --> 00:59:13.140]
I got some

[00:59:13.460 --> 00:59:14.940]
Well good, you chewed now mumble

[00:59:14.940 --> 00:59:15.500]
I'm fine

[00:59:15.500 --> 00:59:16.240]
I'm fine

[00:59:16.840 --> 00:59:18.380]
Marminum, Marminum, Marminum, Marminum, when he's tuning in,

[00:59:18.440 --> 00:59:18.960]
he's not ready to enter.

[00:59:20.280 --> 00:59:20.920]
No, and...

[00:59:21.420 --> 00:59:23.060]
And, of course, all the money raised for charity.

[00:59:23.280 --> 00:59:25.960]
We're supposed to consider that he belonged on the year

[00:59:25.960 --> 00:59:27.400]
because he raised a lot of money for charity.

[00:59:27.700 --> 00:59:29.240]
How about if he would have just gotten off the year

[00:59:29.240 --> 00:59:31.180]
15 years ago and gone out full time

[00:59:31.180 --> 00:59:32.160]
and raised money for charity?

[00:59:33.620 --> 00:59:34.400]
Bunch of aloni.

[00:59:35.300 --> 00:59:35.920]
WQAM, hello.

[00:59:37.120 --> 00:59:37.440]
Hello.

[00:59:37.600 --> 00:59:37.600]

[00:59:37.620 --> 00:59:38.140]
I can choose that.

[00:59:38.140 --> 00:59:38.480]
Yes, sir.

[00:59:39.380 --> 00:59:40.620]
Hey, is Neurological?

[00:59:41.140 --> 00:59:42.000]
Yes, sir, speaking.

[00:59:42.860 --> 00:59:43.620]
Hi, it's Chris.

[00:59:44.280 --> 00:59:44.960]
Hey, Chris.

[00:59:45.420 --> 00:59:46.080]
What do you got?

[00:59:46.600 --> 00:59:47.500]
Is this... is this new?

[00:59:47.920 --> 00:59:48.460]
Yes, it is.

[00:59:49.700 --> 00:59:50.220]
Hey, new.

[00:59:50.460 --> 00:59:50.920]
I wonder...

[00:59:50.920 --> 00:59:53.240]
I wonder what she's got about Barack Obama.

[00:59:53.740 --> 00:59:55.660]
I'll hang up and let you tell us.

[00:59:55.980 --> 00:59:56.520]
Let me evacuate.

[00:59:56.820 --> 00:59:57.080]
Okay.

[00:59:58.560 --> 00:59:59.260]
Now, that poll...

[00:59:59.260 --> 01:00:01.100]
Now, CBS has got to pull that in like too much

[01:00:01.100 --> 01:00:02.320]
because Hillary's way ahead of that one.

[01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:04.520]
But the new CNN poll yesterday showed he had...

[01:00:05.020 --> 01:00:06.920]
Hillary had 36 in Barack had 28.

[01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:08.240]
And nobody even knows who he is yet.

[01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:10.260]
He is your next president.

[01:00:10.260 --> 01:00:11.620]
I don't care what George says.

[01:00:11.620 --> 01:00:12.860]
Who always was giving me crap?

[01:00:12.980 --> 01:00:13.360]
Was it you?

[01:00:13.740 --> 01:00:14.460]
That he can't get elected?

[01:00:15.020 --> 01:00:16.100]
I don't think I said that.

[01:00:16.580 --> 01:00:17.780]
Somebody was giving me that crap.

[01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:18.780]
And whoever was...

[01:00:18.780 --> 01:00:19.960]
I'm going to tell you right now.

[01:00:20.020 --> 01:00:22.240]
Anybody gives me that crap that Barack Obama can't get elected?

[01:00:22.540 --> 01:00:23.780]
I'm going to just blow that crap away.

[01:00:24.220 --> 01:00:25.900]
Just like that North Korean kid did there.

[01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:26.520]
That...

[01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:27.400]
Cho Sing Hui.

[01:00:28.020 --> 01:00:28.460]
That gentleman.

[01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:30.720]
They always say this gentleman.

[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:31.780]
What kind of...

[01:00:31.780 --> 01:00:32.140]
What is that?

[01:00:32.220 --> 01:00:32.940]
He's a crazy person.

[01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:33.800]
He's got a gentleman.

[01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:35.660]
A gentleman implies a gentleman.

[01:00:36.140 --> 01:00:36.920]
A gentleman...

[01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:36.960]
A gentleman...

[01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:38.280]
Don't run around blowing people away.

[01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:39.080]
Okay, with guns.

[01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:41.380]
And all of these things.

[01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:42.820]
Gentlemen, my ass.

[01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:44.620]
That wouldn't be a bad guy.

[01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:44.920]
A man.

[01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:47.440]
And he's got tremendous momentum now.

[01:00:47.660 --> 01:00:48.340]
He's got the old mole.

[01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:49.140]
Don't don't don't.

[01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:51.080]
Wait till mole gets out there, campaign in form.

[01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:52.660]
Like in sunrise lakes.

[01:00:53.140 --> 01:00:53.800]
And in bokeh.

[01:00:54.020 --> 01:00:54.960]
We're all the old Jews live.

[01:00:56.300 --> 01:00:57.540]
Now let's see what we got on that poll.

[01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:00.620]
I don't hopefully make the thousands of day because it would be pretty embarrassing not to do it.

[01:01:00.700 --> 01:01:03.120]
After you came up with that awful idea of getting rid of my hate this poll.

[01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:04.200]
Seven...

[01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:04.640]
A 64.

[01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:07.980]
A will be way over 800 by noon.

[01:01:07.980 --> 01:01:09.220]
Even my gilmaros we can do that.

[01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:09.880]
Not that he cares.

[01:01:09.940 --> 01:01:12.080]
Is he paying any attention to all our seed and stuff?

[01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:13.760]
Not even, but nothing.

[01:01:13.880 --> 01:01:14.300]
Attention either.

[01:01:14.460 --> 01:01:15.260]
Oh, that's okay.

[01:01:16.260 --> 01:01:16.900]
WQA and hello.

[01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:18.140]
This is long as this spots could on.

[01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:20.000]
QA and...

[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:20.340]
Hello?

[01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:21.260]
Yes, sir.

[01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:22.060]
Any know?

[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:23.120]
Yep.

[01:01:23.260 --> 01:01:25.020]
Is this the George Rodriguez show?

[01:01:25.540 --> 01:01:25.900]
What do you want?

[01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:28.700]
WQA and hello.

[01:01:29.380 --> 01:01:29.940]
Good morning.

[01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:30.520]
How you doing?

[01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:31.280]
Okay, sir.

[01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:34.380]
Listen, am I the only one that I see all this time?

[01:01:34.380 --> 01:01:37.940]
Yes, and I just become immune from it.

[01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:39.260]
I don't react.

[01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:40.660]
It used to be a time that...

[01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:44.540]
Everybody has been desensitized to a baby because there's so much of it that goes on.

[01:01:44.780 --> 01:01:47.320]
If he killed 300 people yesterday, people would have said,

[01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:48.080]
oh, gee, what a shame.

[01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:50.460]
And they were going back to watching the dancing with the stars.

[01:01:50.980 --> 01:01:51.300]
I know.

[01:01:51.380 --> 01:01:52.200]
My wife goes to me.

[01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:53.920]
Why are you being so insensitive?

[01:01:54.180 --> 01:01:54.860]
And I tell her, you know what?

[01:01:54.940 --> 01:01:55.360]
It isn't that.

[01:01:55.460 --> 01:01:59.940]
I've seen it so many times that it doesn't do anything for me anymore.

[01:01:59.940 --> 01:02:00.540]
You know what I mean?

[01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:01.060]
I don't...

[01:02:01.060 --> 01:02:01.780]
And I feel bad.

[01:02:01.780 --> 01:02:05.720]
I was sitting here when this was all going down yesterday and we had CNN on.

[01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:09.300]
And I looked back at that and even my reaction to it, I'm ashamed of it.

[01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:14.180]
Because I'm an American man because I'm so immune to being shocked by any grotesque behavior.

[01:02:14.460 --> 01:02:15.880]
Because it's the American F and Wayman.

[01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:16.440]
That's why.

[01:02:17.340 --> 01:02:18.360]
I was watching yesterday.

[01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:19.720]
The movie Bobby, have you seen it?

[01:02:20.380 --> 01:02:20.660]
Bobby?

[01:02:20.900 --> 01:02:21.780]
No, I haven't seen it.

[01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:22.280]
Okay.

[01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:23.240]
There's a lot of actors.

[01:02:23.380 --> 01:02:25.340]
I know you won't like them there, but the part...

[01:02:25.340 --> 01:02:26.440]
In that case, I won't see it.

[01:02:26.820 --> 01:02:30.340]
No, but they have a lot of clips of Bobby in it and speech as he made.

[01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:31.000]
Yeah.

[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.640]
And every speech he made, you can use it today.

[01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:37.980]
You know, he's talking about pollution, he's talking about poverty, he's talking about war.

[01:02:38.140 --> 01:02:38.360]
And I was saying...

[01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:39.220]
And I know something.

[01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:40.360]
That's why he's dead, man.

[01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:42.740]
Yeah, I mean...

[01:02:42.740 --> 01:02:43.260]
Hey, you know what?

[01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:45.240]
It's sad.

[01:02:45.420 --> 01:02:46.360]
It's a sad, you know.

[01:02:46.380 --> 01:02:47.320]
I know that's why you're laughing.

[01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:47.840]
It's sad.

[01:02:47.980 --> 01:02:48.460]
What are you going to do?

[01:02:48.620 --> 01:02:49.560]
Crying might as well laugh.

[01:02:49.980 --> 01:02:50.700]
Yeah, I know.

[01:02:51.060 --> 01:02:52.000]
Well, I'd like to, Pally.

[01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:53.120]
I'll see you on the other side.

[01:02:53.420 --> 01:02:53.980]
One last thing.

[01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:55.720]
Have you heard of a singer called Mika?

[01:02:56.200 --> 01:02:57.000]
M-I-K-A?

[01:02:58.120 --> 01:02:59.540]
He's a young guy.

[01:02:59.540 --> 01:03:00.760]
He's out in Europe.

[01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:02.820]
He sounds just like Brady Mercury.

[01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:03.820]
Really?

[01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:05.940]
If you get a chance to hear it, yeah.

[01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:06.860]
I don't know what it sounds like.

[01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:07.660]
What does he look like?

[01:03:08.900 --> 01:03:09.640]
See you, Pally.

[01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:10.200]
Get out of here.

[01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:15.020]
26 past 11 at 560 WQL on a great Tuesday.

[01:03:15.180 --> 01:03:15.680]
It's not great there.

[01:03:15.900 --> 01:03:17.620]
You know, they're doing a campus killing thing all day.

[01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:22.200]
Like I said, as Rotesque as it was and it's very sad and tragic, it's just, it's not...

[01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:27.340]
I mean, it just kills all this time on CNN and MSNBC and Fox, right?

[01:03:28.220 --> 01:03:28.560]
Yeah.

[01:03:30.380 --> 01:03:32.620]
But it's just more of the same.

[01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:34.080]
You know, it's just more of what goes on in America.

[01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:36.160]
And it's, oh gee, what are we going to do?

[01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:37.440]
Let's pass some more laws.

[01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:39.120]
Let's round up all the guns.

[01:03:39.380 --> 01:03:39.760]
Oh yeah.

[01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:43.420]
The horse is out of the barn and he's on another...

[01:03:43.420 --> 01:03:44.720]
He's in another solar system.

[01:03:44.820 --> 01:03:46.460]
That's how far away the horse is, okay?

[01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:49.140]
Quit looking to close the barn door for Christ's sakes.

[01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:51.200]
And that's right.

[01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:52.120]
Do it for Christ's sake.

[01:03:52.260 --> 01:03:52.840]
He'd approve.

[01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:54.580]
In fact, Eric, one of our...

[01:03:54.580 --> 01:03:56.980]
The guy that sends us all those great comments on our Myspace thing.

[01:03:56.980 --> 01:03:57.760]
He's showing...

[01:03:57.760 --> 01:03:59.340]
There's one with Jesus holding a shotgun.

[01:03:59.940 --> 01:04:00.420]
That's right.

[01:04:01.820 --> 01:04:03.260]
The gun totem, Jesus, baby.

[01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:04.800]
Who would Jesus shoot?

[01:04:05.020 --> 01:04:05.860]
That's what I'd like to know.

[01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:07.400]
I don't know Jesus be shooting.

[01:04:07.500 --> 01:04:07.740]
I know.

[01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:08.540]
Yeah.

[01:04:10.380 --> 01:04:11.520]
Oh, you actually want an answer?

[01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:12.260]
There's a lot of lists.

[01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:13.100]
You're all faxed to you.

[01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:14.880]
It's a little tiny print.

[01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:20.300]
27 past 11 at 560 WDQM.

[01:04:20.460 --> 01:04:21.460]
And we used to be great, man.

[01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:22.420]
We used to be contenders.

[01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:25.220]
We used to be like on top of the world, like Karen Crawford or there.

[01:04:25.940 --> 01:04:28.580]
And now we got Jolly Jo Bell walking around there.

[01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:31.340]
Oh, you're going to have a big march, Neil.

[01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:32.680]
Right.

[01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:39.060]
Hey, Mom, do you crave a delicious pizza and the back child support?

[01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:41.060]
That low-life loser still owes you?

[01:04:41.340 --> 01:04:44.980]
Then call Domino's for our new deadbeat dad pizza.

[01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:47.420]
Domino's deadbeat dad pizza.

[01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:48.640]
Speak of the devil.

[01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:49.320]
It's you.

[01:04:49.560 --> 01:04:51.840]
Oh, hey, here's your pizza.

[01:04:52.300 --> 01:04:53.720]
How much do I owe you?

[01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:54.580]
$7500.

[01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:58.720]
Oh, well, here's a 20.

[01:04:58.820 --> 01:04:59.120]
20.

[01:04:59.500 --> 01:05:02.580]
Yeah, I would add the rest of it if New York had covered the spread.

[01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:05.920]
Oh, hey, I was a little silly doing it anyway.

[01:05:05.980 --> 01:05:08.720]
Her name is Susie and you used that excuse last time.

[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:13.000]
Well, tell her Daddy's asking about her and give her these fudgems, okay?

[01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:16.000]
She needs new shoes and you give her fudgems.

[01:05:16.380 --> 01:05:17.780]
Yeah, there it's $3.99.

[01:05:18.320 --> 01:05:19.940]
I'll just take it off what I owe you.

[01:05:20.580 --> 01:05:21.300]
Oh, okay.

[01:05:21.620 --> 01:05:23.160]
Domino's deadbeat, dead pizza.

[01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:23.960]
Open the door.

[01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:25.040]
It's that SOB.

[01:05:25.780 --> 01:05:27.100]
It's $1133.27.

[01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:28.420]
I'll know that rhymes with SOB.

[01:05:28.900 --> 01:05:29.840]
$33, right?

[01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:30.400]
Yeah.

[01:05:30.580 --> 01:05:32.500]
Climb up with $3.770.

[01:05:32.500 --> 01:05:33.280]
You vote on the pool.

[01:05:33.500 --> 01:05:35.060]
We'll be way over 800 by the top of there.

[01:05:35.140 --> 01:05:35.780]
No sweat, Miguel.

[01:05:35.880 --> 01:05:36.280]
This relax.

[01:05:37.300 --> 01:05:37.520]
Okay.

[01:05:38.600 --> 01:05:43.080]
Well, I would not speak well for you if you sat in there today for a crisp or a fruit.

[01:05:43.180 --> 01:05:45.940]
You might be sitting in for a judge or whoever it will be sitting in that chair.

[01:05:46.020 --> 01:05:46.980]
We didn't get a thousand votes.

[01:05:47.220 --> 01:05:49.800]
Even though it would be my fault for taking that, I hate this pool off of there.

[01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:55.400]
I don't you think George said by forcing we forced their hand so to speak.

[01:05:55.460 --> 01:05:55.600]
Correct.

[01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:56.200]
Well, yeah.

[01:05:56.800 --> 01:05:57.520]
That's another thing.

[01:05:57.620 --> 01:06:00.280]
You got to vote for something or they could go, you know, take a flying leap.

[01:06:00.540 --> 01:06:01.060]
That's right.

[01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:02.420]
Either vote for something or get lost.

[01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:03.760]
Get off our space.

[01:06:04.040 --> 01:06:04.260]
Okay.

[01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:06.440]
There's my space and then there's our space.

[01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:07.020]
That's right.

[01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:08.800]
And that pool is our space.

[01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:10.620]
You got it?

[01:06:10.620 --> 01:06:11.280]
As an outer space.

[01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:12.080]
As an outer space.

[01:06:12.080 --> 01:06:13.280]
All of these are one.

[01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:14.120]
Nothing.

[01:06:14.180 --> 01:06:14.840]
We said the same thing.

[01:06:15.380 --> 01:06:16.120]
Did we really?

[01:06:16.300 --> 01:06:16.480]
Yeah.

[01:06:16.940 --> 01:06:17.920]
I wasn't paying any attention.

[01:06:18.460 --> 01:06:19.220]
5, 6, 7.

[01:06:19.220 --> 01:06:19.520]
But come on.

[01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:22.660]
Let's get some reaction to this tremendous disaster we had yesterday.

[01:06:22.980 --> 01:06:26.440]
I'm not trying to make any light of it, but most people don't care about it.

[01:06:26.820 --> 01:06:27.660]
What are they going to say?

[01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:32.080]
32 dead students plus of course that damn shooter that lunatic.

[01:06:32.980 --> 01:06:37.960]
And we still don't know what the, you know, I keep reading all the articles that he air every break.

[01:06:38.100 --> 01:06:40.320]
I keep going to read all this crap and waiting and waiting.

[01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:41.440]
Well, what was the story?

[01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:44.720]
He had like a bad DM or something or like.

[01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:46.160]
That was a girlfriend issue.

[01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:48.140]
It was a girlfriend issue.

[01:06:48.140 --> 01:06:49.360]
There you go with your friend.

[01:06:49.420 --> 01:06:49.720]
Yeah.

[01:06:49.720 --> 01:06:49.960]
Yeah.

[01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:50.120]
Yeah.

[01:06:50.940 --> 01:06:53.260]
Don't let that bitch destroy your life.

[01:06:53.500 --> 01:06:53.700]
Right.

[01:06:54.080 --> 01:06:55.880]
No matter which bitch we're talking about, okay?

[01:06:56.160 --> 01:06:56.920]
Wipe and run.

[01:06:58.560 --> 01:06:59.440]
Wipe and run?

[01:06:59.740 --> 01:06:59.980]
Sure.

[01:07:00.360 --> 01:07:01.520]
That's what you've been doing all morning.

[01:07:01.920 --> 01:07:03.900]
Well, I don't know about the running part.

[01:07:04.100 --> 01:07:04.920]
I'll just wait till the afternoon.

[01:07:05.580 --> 01:07:06.300]
Dominic Q.A.M.

[01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:06.540]
Hello.

[01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:07.120]
Hey, Neil.

[01:07:07.120 --> 01:07:07.580]
How you doing?

[01:07:07.940 --> 01:07:08.360]
Okay, sir.

[01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:08.860]
Welcome back.

[01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:09.640]
Thank you.

[01:07:09.660 --> 01:07:15.220]
I was watching CNN this morning and I saw they showed all these kids in the chapel praying and everything.

[01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:16.280]
Yeah, that's your word.

[01:07:16.280 --> 01:07:16.720]
I didn't.

[01:07:17.100 --> 01:07:20.040]
And but you know, this is obviously it's terrible.

[01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:21.700]
You know, it's a horrible thing that happened.

[01:07:21.700 --> 01:07:26.660]
But look at the, you know, did they pray and carry on about the carnage that we're inflicting

[01:07:26.660 --> 01:07:28.300]
on the askins and the Iraqis?

[01:07:28.500 --> 01:07:29.900]
I mean, they pay for more.

[01:07:29.900 --> 01:07:29.900]

[01:07:30.080 --> 01:07:31.760]
No, they don't because that's America, man.

[01:07:31.780 --> 01:07:33.180]
And we can do no wrong to understand.

[01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:36.820]
Yeah, but it's like, I don't know.

[01:07:36.980 --> 01:07:38.680]
I think the country's going around the venue.

[01:07:39.020 --> 01:07:41.060]
I don't know if there's any coming back.

[01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:42.280]
I'll see you at the border, pal.

[01:07:42.380 --> 01:07:42.780]
All right.

[01:07:42.980 --> 01:07:43.260]
See you there.

[01:07:43.300 --> 01:07:43.540]
Okay.

[01:07:43.540 --> 01:07:44.780]
Can I have a falls?

[01:07:45.300 --> 01:07:46.080]
How's it going, eh?

[01:07:47.580 --> 01:07:49.480]
All that crap about Canada sucks.

[01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:51.320]
All these punks that haven't got a damn thing to say.

[01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:54.560]
So they think they're going to wound me and they call up Canada sucks.

[01:07:54.780 --> 01:07:55.200]
Yeah, right.

[01:07:56.300 --> 01:07:58.220]
You should only suck like Canada sucks.

[01:07:58.260 --> 01:08:03.600]
Okay, I'm not saying that there aren't a bunch of morons here and homeless sluppers on the

[01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:05.680]
street corners, which is a real disgrace, eh?

[01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:11.500]
And Stephen Harper, who wants to be George Bush light, would never do less.

[01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:16.360]
And then the year ago boxing day, year ago December is last major.

[01:08:16.500 --> 01:08:18.260]
I mean, their shootings take place here a lot of time.

[01:08:18.900 --> 01:08:20.420]
But nothing at all like in the States.

[01:08:20.740 --> 01:08:23.040]
And of course, and that's because most people are in a run around with guns.

[01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:23.840]
And you wonder why?

[01:08:24.060 --> 01:08:25.220]
Because it's freaking illegal.

[01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:26.780]
It's illegal.

[01:08:27.660 --> 01:08:30.640]
They don't have pawn shops up and down the streets like on 441.

[01:08:30.900 --> 01:08:34.020]
Where every five yards you can go in for a few bucks by another stupid ass gun.

[01:08:35.540 --> 01:08:37.820]
Oh, and you better not put any restrictions on the number of weapons.

[01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:39.740]
Either we have to have, we don't just want to have a gun.

[01:08:39.740 --> 01:08:41.200]
We want to have an arsenal of weapons.

[01:08:41.420 --> 01:08:42.260]
Okay, that's what we want.

[01:08:42.460 --> 01:08:44.240]
Not just a gun, but a freaking arsenal.

[01:08:44.540 --> 01:08:46.160]
And anonymously without a license, don't forget that.

[01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:47.720]
That is absolutely correct, sir.

[01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:49.560]
Don't you be effing with our guns.

[01:08:49.700 --> 01:08:51.040]
In fact, I think we'll do that poll tomorrow.

[01:08:51.140 --> 01:08:54.200]
Remember last time and we get, we get, what's the word we always use for that?

[01:08:55.580 --> 01:08:56.440]
When you invade the poll?

[01:08:57.240 --> 01:08:57.540]
Oh, free.

[01:08:57.820 --> 01:08:58.680]
Yeah, we get free.

[01:08:58.860 --> 01:08:59.340]
That's right.

[01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:03.100]
As in the freedom, what's that website?

[01:09:03.300 --> 01:09:04.260]
See, in my mind, it's gone.

[01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:05.360]
Free public.

[01:09:05.820 --> 01:09:07.540]
Free free free free free republic dot com.

[01:09:07.540 --> 01:09:10.000]
Another white wing Nazi website.

[01:09:11.460 --> 01:09:12.620]
So they creeped the poll.

[01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:13.220]
They put it on here.

[01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:15.020]
Everybody get on the Arigas poll and vote.

[01:09:15.180 --> 01:09:16.080]
Don't eff with our guns.

[01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:17.880]
You're all, all these gun-token lunatics.

[01:09:18.100 --> 01:09:19.340]
Because that's all they know from, man.

[01:09:20.020 --> 01:09:22.240]
That's a replacement for their penis is a gun.

[01:09:22.620 --> 01:09:23.660]
That's what that's all about.

[01:09:23.920 --> 01:09:25.160]
It makes them big, man, baby.

[01:09:25.280 --> 01:09:26.280]
It makes them really macho.

[01:09:26.780 --> 01:09:29.540]
Because probably they're firing blanks the rest of the time.

[01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:33.320]
WDQA and we can only pray that that's true.

[01:09:33.540 --> 01:09:34.260]
WQA and hello.

[01:09:34.780 --> 01:09:35.960]
How are you doing?

[01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:50.640]
I'm fine.

[01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:50.640]

[01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:50.640]

[01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:50.640]

[01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:50.640]

[01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:50.640]

[01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:50.640]

[01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:50.820]
I'm fine.

[01:09:50.820 --> 01:09:51.260]
I'm fine.

[01:09:51.260 --> 01:09:51.700]
I'm fine.

[01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:52.760]
I'm fine.

[01:09:52.860 --> 01:09:53.220]
I'm fine.

[01:09:53.220 --> 01:09:53.220]

[01:09:53.220 --> 01:09:53.240]
I'm fine.

[01:09:53.320 --> 01:09:53.320]

[01:09:53.320 --> 01:09:53.800]
I'm fine.

[01:09:54.160 --> 01:09:54.860]
I'm fine.

[01:09:55.360 --> 01:09:55.560]
I'm fine.

[01:09:55.860 --> 01:09:56.660]
I'm fine.

[01:09:57.060 --> 01:09:57.660]
I'm fine.

[01:09:57.660 --> 01:09:57.920]
I'm fine.

[01:09:58.020 --> 01:09:58.200]
I'm fine.

[01:09:59.080 --> 01:09:59.600]
I'm fine.

[01:10:04.260 --> 01:10:04.780]
I'm fine.

[01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:05.760]
I'm fine.

[01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:05.800]
I'm fine.

[01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:05.800]

[01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:05.800]

[01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:05.940]
I'm fine.

[01:10:05.940 --> 01:10:06.240]
I'm fine.

[01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:06.240]

[01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:06.960]
People are going to run around with guns.

[01:10:07.220 --> 01:10:09.680]
There's going to be a lot of dead people as what they figure.

[01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:17.920]
We're going to be detesting their air ammo.

[01:10:19.900 --> 01:10:20.960]
We are going to be detesting our guns.

[01:10:23.860 --> 01:10:27.520]
Now we have a lot of dead people that we have to reach them again.

[01:10:27.780 --> 01:10:28.140]
And people have to reach them again.

[01:10:28.140 --> 01:10:30.860]
There's a lot of people that we have to reach them.

[01:10:30.860 --> 01:10:33.460]
And want something to show people that they maybe have built a fire or some other

[01:10:33.460 --> 01:10:33.460]

[01:10:33.460 --> 01:10:33.540]
They probably thought they would full force or any other gangs out burst out.

[01:10:33.540 --> 01:10:33.540]

[01:10:33.540 --> 01:10:33.540]

[01:10:33.540 --> 01:10:35.920]
I have built quite a lot of there that they could abort or kill even more, like scared of

[01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:38.080]

i guess i mean lastly they were raising all kind of came about

[01:10:55.560 --> 01:10:56.840]
so i'm calling uh...

[01:10:56.840 --> 01:10:57.600]
a group of

[01:10:58.360 --> 01:10:58.680]
napi

[01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:00.580]

and brutal i

[01:11:04.420 --> 01:11:07.040]

yeah he couldn't be long before jessey'll turn into a racial thing you know

[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.460]
because this guy was in north korea did the shooting he was probably a

[01:11:21.460 --> 01:11:21.760]
racist

[01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:25.080]

rabbis and ministers and all these other figures and argue religion with them

[01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:27.280]
and after that the church would let no a priest come on a show no more

[01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:27.880]
uh...

[01:12:28.780 --> 01:12:30.960]

[01:12:46.460 --> 01:12:50.000]
i hate this pool without all the negativity okay with all the evil nasty

[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:53.620]

honeypate professionals like doctors and lawyers

[01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:30.560]
hands on kind of people

[01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:34.980]

money i'd rather go back over there and have me a hell of a time

[01:15:46.980 --> 01:15:50.720]
more than three quarters of physical therapists and firefighters reported being

[01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:51.560]
very satisfied

[01:15:54.600 --> 01:15:58.080]
other occupations which more than sixty percent said they were very satisfied

[01:15:58.080 --> 01:15:59.420]
included teachers

[01:15:59.420 --> 01:16:00.940]
painters and sculptors

[01:16:00.940 --> 01:16:02.600]
psychologist and authors

[01:16:03.520 --> 01:16:06.920]
then say nothing about talk shows or produces or board ops

[01:16:07.520 --> 01:16:09.040]
or promotions people make a

[01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:12.580]
somewhat when we get here about that big promotion coming up one day

[01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:16.920]
the most satisfying jobs are mostly professions especially those involving

[01:16:16.920 --> 01:16:17.640]
caring for

[01:16:18.200 --> 01:16:21.340]
teaching and protecting others and creative pursuits at time w smith

[01:16:21.340 --> 01:16:24.880]
director of n.o.r.c. general social survey a poll supported by the

[01:16:25.820 --> 01:16:27.260]
national science foundation

[01:16:31.620 --> 01:16:34.420]
side of the grand canyon i know another way

[01:16:35.880 --> 01:16:36.400]
what

[01:16:37.100 --> 01:16:39.160]
all of the new normal looking at the company go back

[01:16:39.780 --> 01:16:40.760]
no come on

[01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:45.560]
the worker satisfaction study said for release oh well i guess it's so today

[01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:49.480]
is based on data collected since nineteen eighty eight i'm more than twenty seven

[01:16:49.480 --> 01:16:50.000]
thousand

[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:51.640]
randomly selected people

[01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:55.760]
for the most satisfied workers intrinsic rewards are the key to study says

[01:16:55.760 --> 01:16:57.960]
they're doing work they're very proud of helping people

[01:16:57.960 --> 01:17:00.760]
like i'm doing here every day helping people kill four hours every day

[01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:02.380]
in boring ass out for the

[01:17:03.020 --> 01:17:04.740]
clergy ranked by far

[01:17:05.320 --> 01:17:08.300]
the most satisfied and the most generally happy of hundred ninety

[01:17:08.300 --> 01:17:12.320]
documentation as if they did tell the truth as if they ever are you suggesting

[01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:16.140]
that the uh... the get skis out there are liars saying there's no such thing as

[01:17:16.140 --> 01:17:19.460]
an honest clergyman eighty seven percent clergy said they were very

[01:17:19.460 --> 01:17:22.440]
satisfied with their work compared with an average forty seven percent for all

[01:17:22.440 --> 01:17:26.640]
workers sixty seven percent reported being very happy compared with an average

[01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:30.120]
of thirty three percent for all workers in by the way this this uh... murder

[01:17:30.120 --> 01:17:33.500]
or a son of a bitch he was from south korea

[01:17:33.500 --> 01:17:37.660]
i don't know what they're coming up with king john eel and all i cried

[01:17:37.660 --> 01:17:40.520]
you have a idea how busy i am yeah

[01:17:41.740 --> 01:17:42.860]
what about our problem

[01:17:43.300 --> 01:17:44.380]
we have a record

[01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:51.080]
if if i could watch that like every day i would if i had the time to do that

[01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:53.420]
that's how the most of the work of a dangerous

[01:17:53.980 --> 01:17:54.780]
madame and

[01:17:55.220 --> 01:17:55.580]
that

[01:17:56.700 --> 01:18:00.000]
jackson carol was professor meridus of religion in society at doodled

[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:00.700]
in the school

[01:18:00.700 --> 01:18:03.920]
found similarly high satisfactorily said it brought us into catholic

[01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:07.180]
clergy despite relatively modest that salaries and long hours

[01:18:07.620 --> 01:18:10.680]
they're getting satisfied baby and i have a pretty good idea how

[01:18:11.220 --> 01:18:12.260]
i think i don't know

[01:18:12.820 --> 01:18:14.300]
well some of it

[01:18:14.300 --> 01:18:17.700]
they look at the recupation is a calling carol said a pastor does get called on

[01:18:17.700 --> 01:18:20.640]
to enter into some of the deepest moments of a person's life i think it was

[01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:22.800]
going to say that some of the deepest areas of a person's life

[01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:26.540]
celebrating a birth and sitting with people of tans of illness or death there's a

[01:18:26.540 --> 01:18:27.240]
lot of fulfillment

[01:18:28.260 --> 01:18:30.920]
others in helping profession described the work as a calling

[01:18:31.580 --> 01:18:34.540]
i believe i was probably put on the surface and make somebody's life a little

[01:18:34.540 --> 01:18:35.020]
bit easier

[01:18:35.020 --> 01:18:38.280]
that's what i get out of my job so gena culk and oak par physical therapists

[01:18:38.280 --> 01:18:40.000]
who's practiced twenty three years

[01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:43.520]
i love my job i think it's because i see results very quickly

[01:18:43.520 --> 01:18:45.940]
i see positive things happen to people very quickly

[01:18:45.940 --> 01:18:49.800]
i get rewarded every day by what i do about an apostatuta that's another

[01:18:49.800 --> 01:18:51.880]
example i'm eric is in dark ages ok

[01:18:51.880 --> 01:18:55.960]
and prostitutes illegal smoke a little weed is illegal what do you talk about

[01:18:55.960 --> 01:18:59.260]
anything that's good is illegal for that's a maybe a banana split that

[01:18:59.260 --> 01:19:02.520]
prostituting sounds like a very satisfying profession that's what all you do

[01:19:02.520 --> 01:19:03.980]
in all day long is satisfying people

[01:19:05.920 --> 01:19:09.520]
says i see positive things happen to people very quickly is what gena said

[01:19:09.520 --> 01:19:11.440]
i'm thinking on that line of working probably seem

[01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:13.740]
in some cases probably very very quickly

[01:19:13.740 --> 01:19:14.760]
i'm saying

[01:19:16.680 --> 01:19:20.600]
satisfaction generally rises with social status and higher status often goes

[01:19:20.600 --> 01:19:23.420]
hand in hand if i can say that with higher pay

[01:19:24.120 --> 01:19:27.240]
and exception is doctors are paying professional rank number one in occupational

[01:19:27.240 --> 01:19:28.020]
prestige

[01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:31.600]
general practitioners are more than twice as much as physical therapists for

[01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:31.980]
example

[01:19:31.980 --> 01:19:35.500]
earning average of 140 grand plus compared with 65 grand

[01:19:36.040 --> 01:19:38.200]
yet doctors score lower in satisfaction happiness

[01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:42.000]
well maybe part of the reason for that is number one most of my question number two

[01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:43.260]
everybody that they see is sick

[01:19:44.200 --> 01:19:44.880]
and it's depressing

[01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:47.540]
and the patients are dropping like flies

[01:19:49.240 --> 01:19:53.400]
peter upa 55 and internal medicine physician practices in L. Rose Park

[01:19:53.400 --> 01:19:56.100]
had eight patients in his waiting room and three in examining rooms to the

[01:19:56.100 --> 01:19:56.500]
afternoon

[01:19:57.400 --> 01:20:00.680]
i think most doctors are satisfied the problems we have so much pressure

[01:20:00.680 --> 01:20:04.360]
reset the demand for time is such we're always behind and sometimes it can

[01:20:04.360 --> 01:20:05.080]
be pretty stressful

[01:20:05.660 --> 01:20:08.480]
when somebody comes in ill and you're able to restore them to help there's

[01:20:08.480 --> 01:20:11.280]
nothing greater than that but there's so many regulations is not like he

[01:20:11.280 --> 01:20:14.580]
used to be the demands outside the actual patient care are much greater than

[01:20:14.580 --> 01:20:15.780]
these to be yadi-adi-adi

[01:20:15.780 --> 01:20:19.980]
occupations with least satisfied and happy workers tend to be low-skilled manual

[01:20:19.980 --> 01:20:21.260]
and service jobs

[01:20:23.940 --> 01:20:24.440]
roofers

[01:20:24.980 --> 01:20:28.440]
waiters and laborers ranked at the bottom in job satisfaction with the she was

[01:20:28.440 --> 01:20:30.660]
one in five reporting they were very satisfied

[01:20:31.220 --> 01:20:32.320]
in fact here's the list

[01:20:35.100 --> 01:20:39.120]
top occupations number one clergy and this is job satisfaction clergy

[01:20:39.800 --> 01:20:40.300]
getchies

[01:20:40.300 --> 01:20:44.840]

four education administrators and five painters and sculptors

[01:20:53.980 --> 01:20:55.960]
what what does that mean

[01:20:55.960 --> 01:20:59.580]
bottom occupations in job satisfaction number one roofers

[01:21:00.300 --> 01:21:01.460]
oh i got to play that

[01:21:03.820 --> 01:21:05.200]

[01:21:06.400 --> 01:21:08.000]
up on the roof oh yeah

[01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:08.480]

imagine being a uh waiter no i can just down here like in here in this

[01:21:42.300 --> 01:21:44.100]
line i know how difficult it is to please

[01:21:44.100 --> 01:21:47.740]
doing this for thirty one years in this town but the idea of actually having

[01:21:47.740 --> 01:21:51.600]
to face people not being able to slam the damn phone down it's like like that

[01:21:51.600 --> 01:21:53.660]
when it doubt slam it out

[01:21:55.040 --> 01:21:57.660]
just like that ketchup in the bottle i think you sent me yesterday

[01:21:58.120 --> 01:21:58.520]

[01:22:06.140 --> 01:22:09.120]
in fact i'd like to find out what country that was what language with these

[01:22:09.120 --> 01:22:12.720]
big friends was it friends i think so yet well

[01:22:12.720 --> 01:22:17.400]
part of who jump on z and labor is not construction bottom uh right down there

[01:22:17.400 --> 01:22:21.460]
in the bottom not construction so it's such as like yeah i'll send me

[01:22:21.460 --> 01:22:24.780]
lying people people like uh working in the auto plants in detour it's stuff

[01:22:24.780 --> 01:22:25.200]
like that

[01:22:26.600 --> 01:22:29.920]
the question you're working in detroit you'd be pretty of the press too i

[01:22:29.920 --> 01:22:32.180]
thought i'd just heard a fask him over a little while ago and i reached back

[01:22:32.180 --> 01:22:32.980]
there is nothing on it

[01:22:32.980 --> 01:22:36.280]
do i imagine that am i hallucinating now or what

[01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:42.160]
maybe because i say if yesterday was a v plus this is definitely at least an

[01:22:42.160 --> 01:22:46.060]
a-minus today is what i'm thinking i'm starting to get it back you know i mean

[01:22:46.060 --> 01:22:49.860]
yet yesterday i had that scratchy throat no matter what flight is first

[01:22:49.860 --> 01:22:54.000]
of it's a long flight the air the air quality and plane always sucks

[01:22:54.500 --> 01:22:58.540]
it's always really bad and why is that because there's no circulation right

[01:22:59.120 --> 01:23:03.200]
right well they're circulating it the same air all over you know over and over again

[01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:07.500]
yeah they're not pumping in anything new well why not why can't they pump up some

[01:23:07.500 --> 01:23:10.960]
fresh freaking air in a money for the money that they're charging air it costs

[01:23:10.960 --> 01:23:15.460]
money to compress air into those tanks and uh take your seats i just love them

[01:23:15.460 --> 01:23:18.780]
and i've been now when you fly kyle and next time when you go to antonne yeah next week

always a good sign and it sounds like they got although this time was a different guy

[01:23:26.420 --> 01:23:30.560]
maybe maybe i've just had luck i've always had the same pilot my eight million trips i've taken

[01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:34.280]
over there because it always sounds like the same guy kevin crude take your seats

[01:31:31.380 --> 01:31:36.980]
Ricky is still all the press which i'm sure he is oh listen is there some excellent advice from

[01:31:36.980 --> 01:31:45.280]
the professor mm-hmm okay you know the professor no my online friend yes he said you know

[01:31:45.280 --> 01:31:49.620]
well why do you have to keep playing games okay i'm gonna tell your other friend about the kind

[01:31:49.620 --> 01:31:56.380]

[01:32:02.100 --> 01:32:06.760]
he's on the way down the right and whatever anyway here's the message Ricky it says tell that

[01:32:06.760 --> 01:32:10.820]
kid to take it as a lesson learned and move right along the press is a complete waste of time

[01:32:11.520 --> 01:32:15.860]
meeting people online is a crap shoe just like a real life some are weirdos some are great

[01:32:15.860 --> 01:32:20.160]
some are just normal as long as you don't get your hopes up or test anyone you don't really know

[01:32:20.160 --> 01:32:25.080]
you'll never get hurt or bothered remind him there plenty more online victims waiting is he

[01:32:25.080 --> 01:32:28.820]
fanned another year something no actually he's not he's like a very normal decent looking guy

[01:32:29.200 --> 01:32:32.660]
it says if that's the case i guess it could be sad thinking you finally self-found something to pay

[01:32:32.660 --> 01:32:36.280]
attention to you only to find that you're wrong but if he's good looking then sweating about it

[01:32:36.280 --> 01:32:39.980]
is the stupidest most regrettable thing he could do it's still been regrettable Ricky quit worrying

[01:32:39.980 --> 01:32:45.140]
about that's right also here's the best part of the advice also tell him the next time he decides to

[01:34:22.020 --> 01:34:26.160]
eating a minimum number of calories you see it in the city did you see him again that's old logic

[01:34:26.160 --> 01:34:30.160]
i mean they've been talking about that for years yeah and if you eat almost no calories just

[01:34:30.160 --> 01:34:34.860]
just to keep you going you're gonna live like a hundred years old well who now wants to live to

[01:47:57.060 --> 01:48:01.960]
a high school was on lockdown around noon today and after police at a student said he had a

[01:48:01.960 --> 01:48:05.300]
gun and was threatening to kill himself this is how he would hit a hills high

[01:48:08.500 --> 01:48:12.380]
you ready for that all right police at the incident occurred surely before noon

[01:48:12.380 --> 01:48:16.260]
and how he would hills high 50 400 sterling road there was no media information on the student

[01:48:16.260 --> 01:48:20.320]
but police at the child's indie at a gun it was gonna commit suicide after classes

[01:48:21.980 --> 01:48:26.200]
no other details immediately available the high school enrolls more than 2260 on students at

[01:48:26.200 --> 01:48:31.360]
grades nine through twelve monkey do monkey see monkey do however that goes a lot of do do ever see a

[01:48:31.360 --> 01:48:38.600]
monkey do I don't want to see it again he claimed he had a gun and was gonna commit suicide after

[01:48:38.600 --> 01:48:42.820]
classes in other words I guess he wanted to get as educated as he possibly sure before he blew his

[01:48:42.820 --> 01:48:47.440]
brains out might as well get a lot of information in there and then like but a bing you know you

[01:48:47.440 --> 01:48:52.800]
you know how that goes hmm after you absorb all that very important information no

[01:48:52.800 --> 01:48:55.620]
being your brain's along with a nice cyber league suit that's right that's right

[01:48:55.620 --> 01:49:00.020]
what's probably not worrying about these suit but you never know so that's how he would

[01:49:00.020 --> 01:49:04.240]
hills high and will keep my eye peeled on that see if there's any more information but this is

[01:49:04.240 --> 01:49:09.440]

[01:52:24.260 --> 01:52:28.740]
and i mean that seems the america's thing and they're always trying to protect us so much and

[01:52:28.740 --> 01:52:35.380]
just sometimes stuff happens i mean you can protect yeah is the collagen against the maniac like

[01:52:35.380 --> 01:52:41.480]
this and what are you gonna do yeah i mean it's as sad as it is just these things happen yeah

[01:52:41.480 --> 01:52:45.980]
these are over the countries where everybody's got guns that's right and flipping over to six ten

[01:52:45.980 --> 01:52:51.400]
their their saying this happened because they had a no gun policy on the campus and if

[01:52:51.400 --> 01:52:56.080]
kids had guns they were took care of this guy whenever been the numbers it wasn't right that's

[01:52:56.080 --> 01:53:00.160]
right if everybody had guns and we just have a big shootout now you're talking sir you're talking

[01:53:00.160 --> 01:53:05.480]
nonsense okay it's a america get see the problem with most people in the u.s especially in soft

[01:53:05.480 --> 01:53:10.080]
photos they're so parochial they never been anywhere and so they think i have 20 million times

[01:53:10.080 --> 01:53:14.660]
this is they think this is the way that life is supposed to be they think that this is the way

[01:53:14.660 --> 01:53:19.120]
works in the real world where you're not living in the real world you're living in a slaughterhouse

[01:53:19.660 --> 01:53:23.080]
you're living in a place where everybody they get pissed off about something they pull out a gun

[01:53:23.080 --> 01:53:28.380]
and they snuff out there's like actually also before a billion times a country where they don't

[01:53:28.380 --> 01:53:32.780]
respect human life can never be a great country and you can talk all the platitudes and all the

[01:53:32.780 --> 01:53:39.020]
bulk crap that you want to the u.s is a disaster country now all they know is violence importing

[01:53:39.020 --> 01:53:44.460]
and exporting it and on each other no there's no value there's no way in the world that this

[01:53:44.460 --> 01:53:49.620]
administration could have lied their way into a war there were 3,300 people have died and 600,000

[01:53:49.620 --> 01:53:54.360]
Iraqis have died and the public would just sit back and what time is dancing with the stars on

[01:53:54.360 --> 01:53:58.400]

go ahead former and thank you so much former intelligence officials confirmed the associated

[02:22:46.650 --> 02:22:51.530]
press yesterday a Le Mans newspaper report that Francis Ford and intelligence service had

[02:22:51.530 --> 02:22:55.650]
heard about an al-Qaeda plot which was likely to involve a US Airplane the French

[02:22:56.250 --> 02:23:01.450]
paper also reported that France confirmed the CIA prior to the in excuse me the French paper

[02:23:01.450 --> 02:23:06.330]
also reported that France informed the CIA prior to the attacks at 9.11 in which nearly 3000 people

[02:23:06.330 --> 02:23:11.070]
were killed however it's uncertain whether the intelligence was alluded these specific plot

[02:23:11.070 --> 02:23:16.350]
hatched at 11 the external intelligence service wrote a total of nine reports between September 2000

[02:23:16.350 --> 02:23:21.130]
and August 2001 on al-Qaeda threats against the West and passed all them on to the CIA's

[02:23:21.130 --> 02:23:27.250]
Paris Bureau a French newspaper be saying Le Mans based its report on 328 pages of classified

[02:23:27.250 --> 02:23:31.990]
documents leaked by DGSE sources showing that our some of it loves the network had been infiltrated

[02:23:31.990 --> 02:23:38.250]
by foreign agents long before the 9.11 attacks in a five day in January 5th 2001 also seen by

[02:23:38.250 --> 02:23:44.030]
agent France press the DGSE said a word of a plan to hijack a plane bomb for the US from Frankfurt

[02:23:44.030 --> 02:23:50.690]
and Germany and take it to Kandaher in Afghanistan Pierre Antoine Lorenzi the former chief of staff

[02:23:50.690 --> 02:23:54.470]
of the agency director at the time said you remember the note and they mentioned only they

[02:23:54.470 --> 02:23:59.030]
got lines of a hijacking plot nothing that foreshadowed the scabbled 9.11 attacks he said

[02:23:59.730 --> 02:24:03.510]
the former French intelligence official told the AP it wasn't about a specific airliner specific

[02:24:03.510 --> 02:24:07.590]
day it wasn't a precise plot according to Le Mans the documents included notes reports

[02:24:07.590 --> 02:24:13.290]
ratio of synthesis charts graphs flow charts satellite photos gathered between July 2000 and

[02:24:13.290 --> 02:24:18.250]
October 2001 but nevertheless we could never have known could we could they

[02:24:21.310 --> 02:24:25.930]
no and we're worried because Don I'm a said nappy headed hose on the air because Anna Nicole

[02:24:25.930 --> 02:24:29.870]
Anderson both died because there are a couple of junkies and all of this stuff you know

[02:24:29.870 --> 02:24:34.970]
glad we got our priorities all straight now 9.49 man this thing is slow down to a crawl now on the

[02:24:34.970 --> 02:24:40.890]
pole I think they're playing with us we need 51 votes in 37 minutes I thought the ratio was

[02:24:40.890 --> 02:24:45.310]
going pretty good there for a while and I'm clicking at view current thing you know and out of

[02:24:45.310 --> 02:24:49.690]
damn things have it a 9.50 they're coming in by the ones that's not going to cut at 50 votes in

[02:24:49.690 --> 02:24:56.710]
37 minutes you see how they like to toy with my emotions on this crap yeah but I'm glad that

[02:24:56.710 --> 02:25:00.250]
Ricky you're saving that story now you through my video you know or you kidding we're doing a

[02:25:00.250 --> 02:25:07.350]
radio show over here I'll read during the breaks we're doing a radio show over here look I might

[02:25:07.350 --> 02:25:11.290]
make time to text you know somebody might have an adulterous relationship with but I'm not going

[02:25:11.290 --> 02:25:17.050]
to say her and read a story on my space during the radio show well that's outrageous I think

[02:25:17.050 --> 02:25:22.850]
you're gonna hurt Ricky's feelings he understands how the hell do you know he understands he might

[02:25:22.850 --> 02:25:28.290]
be a little peo to you 9.50 on the pole by the way it's just it's just sitting there on 9.50 I

[02:25:28.290 --> 02:25:35.370]
think I think everybody's gone that's it and we did they shut it off we got a Marlon game coming

[02:25:35.370 --> 02:25:40.390]
on or what no I was in the Astros tonight by the way ad Houston don't have to worry about going to

[02:25:40.390 --> 02:25:46.390]
the ballpark not that you'd go anyway all big debate over Virginia text handling of the crisis

[02:25:46.390 --> 02:25:53.230]
there's no question they handled it just brilliantly just assume this and they assume that it was

[02:25:53.230 --> 02:25:57.630]
isolated incident and then they told kids to go back into the dorm and you know just go back

[02:25:57.630 --> 02:26:01.270]
in your house and make babies like Martha Jean the Queen would say in Detroit during the riots in

[02:26:01.270 --> 02:26:06.730]
67 or like they told people in the World Trade Center go back it's safe go back inside remember that

[02:26:06.730 --> 02:26:12.690]
how could we forget yes I think Eric is playing with my emotions here I think he's frozen up you know

[02:26:12.690 --> 02:26:17.750]
oh 9.50 too just a small chunk like the kind you get out of your nostril when it's only like

[02:26:17.750 --> 02:26:23.510]
partially plugged up you know you put your finger over one nostril go oh oh oh oh man that's how

[02:26:23.510 --> 02:26:31.130]
it really now yeah moist 9.52 and they're putting the screw to you mister if we don't get to a

[02:26:31.130 --> 02:26:35.550]
thousand by because you were the one it said let's not do that I hate that stuff anymore yeah

[02:26:35.550 --> 02:26:43.510]
and now 9.56 we need 44 votes in 35 minutes and the beat goes on the beat goes on that was

[02:26:43.510 --> 02:26:47.810]
a some you share it wasn't horrible horrible horrible horrible yeah you're gonna have to hear an awful

[02:26:47.810 --> 02:26:53.070]
song you know when Sunny Bono had that skiing accident he went into the tree and died and croaked

[02:26:53.710 --> 02:27:00.790]
that was a great day for the human race yeah I never huh I didn't mind it oh you thought this

[02:27:00.790 --> 02:27:06.470]
was a good song no no I didn't mind him hitting the tree oh yeah me too I mean to

[02:27:06.470 --> 02:27:14.530]
write up for the poster the beat goes on with a little help from my friend kill him shoot him we don't

[02:27:14.530 --> 02:27:19.150]
like the music shoot him that's America for you know if you sing a bad song if you do a crappy

[02:27:19.150 --> 02:27:23.530]
your concert they're gonna shoot your ass that's all oh look at that the police said we thought

[02:27:23.530 --> 02:27:27.710]
initially the dorm shooting was a domestic situation you always make a lot of assumptions is a good

[02:27:28.310 --> 02:27:32.230]
one some crazy person with a bunch of guns is on the loose and their shootings were on always

[02:27:32.230 --> 02:27:38.610]
assume this or assume that and always take plenty of time before we inform the students to

[02:27:39.070 --> 02:27:42.670]
batten down the hatches that there's a crazy person with gun on the loose and you're maybe

[02:28:04.750 --> 02:28:08.630]
gonna get killed unbelievable

[02:28:12.670 --> 02:28:18.570]
please be well done to slide me for the best days no limit see no mercy no my friend

[02:28:18.570 --> 02:28:22.170]

[02:28:22.170 --> 02:28:25.850]
push this bridge and you play the little leader better than the one you're playing

[02:28:25.850 --> 02:28:31.190]
with the meter there's your sub-eat up on your list and then the white house of some

[02:28:31.190 --> 02:28:35.170]
peanut push this bridge and you play the little leader better than the one you're playing

[02:28:35.170 --> 02:28:41.130]
with the meter there's your sub-eat up what's 31 we certainly don't want to offend anybody

[02:28:41.130 --> 02:28:47.070]
that's her damn sure right Keith you jackass you you go back to do it on ball scores okay

[02:28:47.070 --> 02:28:52.130]
something that you know something about how pathetic he's gotta be fired did it you know

[02:28:52.130 --> 02:28:57.930]
that reminds me of oh yeah not what I thought you just love that people in the business when they

[02:28:57.930 --> 02:29:02.530]
run around trying to get other people fired into the door no I love it good material anyway

[02:29:02.530 --> 02:29:08.310]
that is and the interesting part is we're still here again paychecks and last time I checked he

[02:29:08.310 --> 02:29:12.230]
was still like I is he still on 850 doing some kind of a funky stuff on a weekend or what does

[02:29:12.230 --> 02:29:17.050]
Miguel I don't know I don't know either you don't know you're the you're the local radio guru

[02:29:17.050 --> 02:29:23.570]
mister myster mr. myster and you don't know what that means he's about his obscure

[02:29:23.570 --> 02:29:27.070]
even more sure than default because you know that default was still on across the street

[02:29:27.070 --> 02:29:32.830]
default is on our early morning not early enough he ought to be on when everybody's asleep

[02:29:33.390 --> 02:29:42.050]
well that's basically it yeah kind of like a rock solid like him see 965 votes on the pool I think

[02:29:42.050 --> 02:29:47.910]
we'll do it it's gonna be intense we need 35 votes in 28 minutes yeah it's just barely over one

[02:29:47.910 --> 02:29:53.330]
minute if a legendary show like this can even without I hate this pool although it's not going

[02:29:53.330 --> 02:29:57.410]
anywhere still if I was keep clicking at view current I'd be better off wouldn't I although it's

[02:29:57.410 --> 02:30:03.310]
still says 965 damn it I don't know what it is I think it's something you did what did you say

[02:30:04.350 --> 02:30:09.830]
what did you do that totally audience again it's still yeah me I'm a girl I think you did it

[02:30:09.830 --> 02:30:15.550]
comedy stuff guess right when a guy called and said Miguel Escobar Comanista at that point everybody

[02:30:15.550 --> 02:30:19.850]
just dropped the radio and ran for it it's still stuck and I think Eric is poaching with it you

[02:30:19.850 --> 02:30:24.990]
know he's done that before after he did that hard research earlier about the I hate this pool

[02:30:24.990 --> 02:30:29.710]
still that was pretty interesting it's still stuck on 965 we're never going to get to a thousand at

[02:30:29.710 --> 02:30:34.990]
this rate unless you people start coming through and clumps okay even if you don't have an opinion

[02:30:34.990 --> 02:30:39.970]
or just lie lie about it for Christ's sake do it for Jesus what would Jesus vote

[02:30:42.250 --> 02:30:46.910]
something I claim to hate and secretly enjoy is masturbation to allow Jesus shares how

[02:30:46.910 --> 02:30:54.610]
wouldn't do that the jury's springer show 137 Jesus would be cut dead watch in that the

[02:30:54.610 --> 02:30:58.970]
carpenters 129 he might listen to that a little bit you think kind of mellow sure when you

[02:30:58.970 --> 02:31:05.690]
kind of a mellow fellow with sandals with virgin was a carpenters that's right well no his father's

[02:31:05.690 --> 02:31:11.430]
daddy was a carpenter wasn't it but he was a carpenter too yes he was I never knew that

[02:31:11.430 --> 02:31:19.730]
Joe the guy nailed niels pulls 89 country music 85 right on my ass vanilla ice cream 83 homosexuality

horrors 19 republican 17 democrats 7 967 we need 33 votes in 26 minutes

[02:31:37.370 --> 02:31:41.810]
now ordinarily I wouldn't be at least bit concerned about that the seeing the way seeing the way

[02:31:41.810 --> 02:31:45.730]
that these aren't coming in a jug and it clumps the way they often do and I keep refreshing I keep

[02:31:45.730 --> 02:31:55.650]
clicking at view courting and it still stays the same 9 68 there's one there's one I think that's

[02:31:55.650 --> 02:32:00.570]
what I'm assuming when to visit the Rutgers women's a basketball team there's one naphy headed

[02:32:00.570 --> 02:32:07.430]
whole 9 70 now see now now they're starting to make some sense coming in chunks 9 71 let's kind

[02:32:07.430 --> 02:32:12.990]
of all the way down to 1000 what do you say or take a bunch of good calls wq a m hello

[02:32:13.990 --> 02:32:21.270]
hey yeah i knew a guy from the he went to school with sonny bowdo yeah and this guy told him that

[02:32:21.270 --> 02:32:28.670]
everybody at school thought that uh that sonny was a fruitcake fruit you mean the game all yeah

[02:32:29.810 --> 02:32:33.490]
maybe share with just the breer she was sure that you're masculine one on that period no question

[02:32:33.490 --> 02:32:37.550]
about that everybody thought that sonny was gay fruitcake how do you like that for a term fruitcake

[02:32:37.550 --> 02:32:41.590]
so you can come on here and say fruitcake knocking on the baguettes and stuff like that and it's

[02:32:41.590 --> 02:32:46.930]
totally my ass but if somebody goes on and says naphy headed the hose on the i'm a show then right

[02:32:46.930 --> 02:32:52.650]
away they're going to get their ass can see the separate service I bet your harvester is going to

[02:32:52.650 --> 02:32:59.350]
trace that last call and come and blow your house down sir or something wq way and hello

[02:32:59.350 --> 02:33:05.790]
good afternoon sir yes sir as I heard your comments earlier about Keith Holerman just

[02:33:05.790 --> 02:33:11.950]
to the whole background he has been trying to get i'm a soft that station per three years off

[02:33:11.950 --> 02:33:17.530]
that network how is that based on what they don't get along and like each other and if i

[02:33:17.530 --> 02:33:24.530]
can compare and contrast you and Alex Bennett okay it was more or less that kind of uh you know

[02:33:24.530 --> 02:33:31.770]
that they didn't get along they never got along it goes sleep back so all I think he did was strike

[02:33:31.770 --> 02:33:36.430]
while the iron was yeah they just stabbed him in the back well you know and I can't think of a

[02:33:36.430 --> 02:33:40.890]
better target the years I'm a system audible you know what I mean yeah and he should have been

[02:33:40.890 --> 02:33:44.690]
off the year 15 years ago but the idea that somebody on the network goes in trying he gets him

[02:33:44.690 --> 02:33:50.630]
fired because they hate each other like poison I'm sorry I'm not buying it I'm off his list he's

[02:33:50.630 --> 02:33:56.630]
off my list he can go to hell I don't hate that crap the worst people in this business are the

[02:33:56.630 --> 02:34:01.390]
people that pull crap like that and I used to get accused of that all the time oh Neil got this

[02:34:01.390 --> 02:34:06.010]
one canned and that one can and this one showed you all the time and never happened ever once

[02:34:06.010 --> 02:34:10.490]
never once I remember the day that boy Gary came in and said to me how much do you hate Joey

[02:34:10.490 --> 02:34:13.910]
Reynolds I said I don't hate anybody what is that oh well he wants to come back we want to put

[02:34:13.910 --> 02:34:17.130]
him back out a weekend I said do whatever you want I don't hate him what do I what do I have to do

[02:34:17.130 --> 02:34:24.390]
with it remember those days yep always getting the cues got this one sandbag the one or whatever

[02:34:24.390 --> 02:34:28.750]
I just get my opinion that's all and if they don't like it too freaking bad nine 80 on a pull we're

[02:34:28.790 --> 02:34:34.670]
going to make it now we can make it and I think it's because I said Jesus a few times and I said

[02:34:34.670 --> 02:34:38.770]
something nice about all Jesus I think that's what got us through baby you can't praise Jesus

[02:34:38.770 --> 02:34:43.290]
enough praise the Lord man and see the right issue that the way it goes praise the Lord and pass

[02:34:43.290 --> 02:34:48.770]
this and you should either order all in religious nuts all these fundamentalists lunatics spreading

[02:34:48.770 --> 02:34:56.450]
spying hate and bile and vulgar swill can't even spit it out although

[02:34:58.450 --> 02:35:04.230]
981 see that coming in very nicely now and what do you know something there must be nothing else

[02:35:04.230 --> 02:35:09.650]
going on in the world because I've been sitting here since 815 is formerly I always amary 25

[02:35:09.650 --> 02:35:14.930]
whatever it was I have I don't recall seeing any other story about any other thing

[02:35:15.590 --> 02:35:20.770]
high school there was field high school in the area and he was an undergrad here at Virginia

[02:35:20.770 --> 02:35:26.270]
attack a senior he was ugly boy he was really ugly maybe maybe that's why I got pissed off maybe

[02:35:26.270 --> 02:35:29.790]
that's why I had that domestic problem see there isn't any indication there wasn't any domestic

[02:35:29.790 --> 02:35:34.490]
altercation first they were saying that they assumed that they had no idea they just figure

[02:35:34.490 --> 02:35:39.510]
well he's ugly in the bitch dump them you know or maybe it was his boyfriend maybe he was

[02:35:39.510 --> 02:35:44.710]
a fruitcake who knows wouldn't that be ashamed that's that's all I need you know

[02:35:46.230 --> 02:35:50.570]
that's all these so-called gay community needs now let me just say it one more time okay just

[02:35:50.570 --> 02:35:54.130]
to clarify for the audience that maybe you know are getting really tired of all this crap and I

[02:35:54.130 --> 02:36:01.110]
am too travel take a gun hold up a store use that money and travel to somewhere else in the world

[02:36:01.890 --> 02:36:07.190]
and then you'll see this doesn't go on oh yeah we get stories like you know it's happened and it

[02:36:07.190 --> 02:36:12.030]
happened in Germany in school that time remember that in Russia but generally speaking day in and day

[02:36:12.030 --> 02:36:20.430]
out when you travel like in western Europe nobody has guns in Italy for example you go to a

[02:36:20.430 --> 02:36:24.390]
Roma baby and they police you and they caught up in the air they have the guns nobody else has gotten

[02:36:24.390 --> 02:36:29.830]
in the soldiers they got guns nobody else has guns and I told you that's true one day we were

[02:36:29.830 --> 02:36:36.730]
coming out of the restaurant in Rome and there were a couple women screaming and yelling and

[02:36:36.730 --> 02:36:41.730]
tourists you know and there had been a son of a gunshot which is totally unexpected and some

[02:36:41.730 --> 02:36:46.070]
puncture of had gotten a gun and he was he was just shooting up in the area wasn't shooting it

[02:36:46.070 --> 02:36:49.690]
anybody he was just like some kind of a protest you know some crap they're always protesting

[02:36:50.610 --> 02:36:56.130]
and he shot fired off a shot in the year and right away everybody started panicking and the cops

[02:36:56.130 --> 02:37:01.170]
came from every direction you have never seen so many policia in your life every kind of cop

[02:37:01.170 --> 02:37:06.930]
uh... you know police you have got a knee at the uh... shlupers uh... every kind of outfit in uniform and they

[02:37:06.930 --> 02:37:11.790]
dragged his ass into this like uh... alleyway and uh... you know that was the end of that

[02:37:12.290 --> 02:37:17.010]
and I guarantee they took the gun and they beat the living snot out of his ass I could be wrong about that

[02:37:18.690 --> 02:37:24.130]
you thought I want to say fallen ricky story it's just it's just it's very rare people don't need

[02:37:24.130 --> 02:37:30.390]
guns civilized people don't need guns animals barbarians people are not respected for human life

[02:37:30.390 --> 02:37:35.750]
they need guns they want guns because that's uh... the whole life but uh... what if you want to shoot

[02:37:35.750 --> 02:37:38.070]
somebody that's right then you need to get

[02:37:38.970 --> 02:37:43.910]
right then and you know where most of the guns in canada are imported from what do you think most of

[02:37:43.910 --> 02:37:44.730]
them come from

[02:37:45.270 --> 02:37:50.250]

[02:44:07.770 --> 02:44:11.110]
percentage would you say no five people out of 1323

[02:44:11.630 --> 02:44:15.170]
and i do basically try to respond virtually everybody although i will say

[02:44:15.170 --> 02:44:20.750]

they're like living and breathing real other people on there and look legit it's

[02:44:36.850 --> 02:44:40.950]
just that he looks so good you know i mean by that no what do you mean what i

[02:44:40.950 --> 02:44:44.270]
mean is that sometimes when people look too good to be true it's because

[02:44:44.270 --> 02:44:48.690]

[02:48:12.590 --> 02:48:14.470]
Keep your guard up too while you're at it

[02:48:14.470 --> 02:48:15.450]
Keep your guard up

[02:48:15.450 --> 02:48:16.290]
Keep your right guard

[02:48:16.290 --> 02:48:17.130]
And your left guard

[02:48:17.130 --> 02:48:17.610]
Oh yeah

[02:48:18.050 --> 02:48:18.450]
Right

[02:48:18.450 --> 02:48:19.710]
And also keep your

[02:48:19.710 --> 02:48:20.990]
But not too high

[02:48:20.990 --> 02:48:21.830]
And not like a jockey

[02:48:22.710 --> 02:48:24.150]
You ever notice how the jockeys

[02:48:24.150 --> 02:48:25.670]
The first part of the race they're like

[02:48:25.670 --> 02:48:29.090]
Asses like straight up in the air like that's for aerodynamics I guess

[02:48:29.930 --> 02:48:31.070]
When in doubt, air it out

[02:48:31.070 --> 02:48:31.970]
Is that what you're trying to say?

[02:48:32.510 --> 02:48:34.370]
I always say air on the side of caution

[02:48:34.370 --> 02:48:36.930]
And we got a thousand twenty six votes but who's counting

[02:48:36.930 --> 02:48:37.770]
Bye bye bye
