[00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:37.520]
I honestly have no clue 13 were you better start thinking about it but for those of you who

[00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:42.440]
haven't figured it out yet I want you to think about this when you step on an ant when you step

[00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:46.380]
on a cockroach you ever have a cockroach like in the kitchen your turn on the light and there's

[00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:51.340]
one on the floor yeah use a little step on why not that's the whole squishing thing well what about an

[00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:56.620]
ant yeah of course you can step on the ant right yeah or you'd like to swat it like that right

[00:15:56.620 --> 00:16:02.740]
uh-huh like a mosquito like that right uh-huh now what happens to that ant after you step on it

[00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:07.180]
after you grind it with your shoe into the pavement well I think that's all one time like a little

[00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:12.260]
like a whisp go up so I figure that was it sold even yeah it now it's sold was going into Ant heaven

[00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:18.740]
exactly I honestly had no clue 13 become nothing more than worm food six have a good rest five

[00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:22.560]
that was my addition Charlie be I put that on there that's what I voted for have a good rest

[00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:28.080]
because after a long stressful life god only knows and I'm talking about there's no god either

[00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:32.080]
kids there's no Santa Claus there's no god it's just a bunch of crap that the silly people made up

[00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:35.300]
a long time ago and your parents keep telling you this because their parents told them

[00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:41.800]
it's a good way to hate each other oh my god I got the right god uh live on an afterlife too

[00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:47.760]
become a ghost one and be reincarnated one see the whole thing about reincarnation is if you came

[00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:51.120]
back like as a rabbit would you would you know would you remember that you were like christian

[00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:55.880]
former life would you follow what I'm saying yeah I'll tell you what it happens I mean

[00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:59.620]
I'll look you up live on an afterlife and what what are you gonna be doing in the afterlife with

[00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:03.980]
nobody I you're gonna be singing I ain't got nobody there's another one no sirens man

[00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:08.500]
well a lot ambulances and a lot of paramedics and a lot of people go to the hospital a lot of

[00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:14.120]
dying going on even on a holidays god screws up the will Smith thing really just is I don't know

[00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:19.820]
I never liked him in the first place see I will admit to one thing since that's just time of the year

[00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:25.040]
no I admit to one thing and that is that there are a lot of people in show business I don't like

[00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:29.640]
it all or in politics and some of them are white and many of them are black but when one of them is

[00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:34.780]
like like the guy Tony Harris on CNN I wouldn't care if he was purple I don't care what skin color is

[00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:40.520]
I just can't stand him he meets my skin crawl I cannot stand him his whole routine that he puts

[00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:44.940]
on there just nauseating and the thing was will Smith I mean I don't just like Will Smith because

[00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:49.260]
he's black I just dislike him because I find him obnoxious do you like Will Smith I don't have a

[00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:52.940]
problem with himself oh you know you just cut out again I don't have a problem with him

[00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:56.700]
I heard I heard what you said you know I'll say it again but you can say it again because if you

[00:17:56.700 --> 00:18:01.120]
say everything twice it kills a lot of good time okay okay oh you cut out bad there oh oh

[00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:05.860]
oh now how can that be happening everything was fine we kind of can family to this morning I heard

[00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:11.060]
Joe Rose everything is a sound to just great all the spots we're finding all of a sudden after we

[00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:17.160]
came on the first break like that Will Smith sees the good and Hitler said the Harold son in Australia

[00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:23.180]
you as actor Will Smith has stunned fans by reportedly declaring that Nazi dictator and all Hitler was

[00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:28.180]
essentially a good person I didn't like Will Smith before and now I hate him like poison I hated him

[00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:33.840]
anyway just something about him I just he I think it's called a lot L.O.T you know what that stands

[00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:39.120]
for no lack of talent and I will see an instaure to follow up is that Will Smith is angry over

[00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:43.580]
celebrity gossip website articles that said he missed that he said misinterpreted a recent remark

[00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:49.320]
he made in a Scottish newspaper about eight-all Hitler a Scottish paper yeah baby ever been to

[00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:53.840]
Scotland not yet you think that the birds are constantly the one of the Scottish of course they

[00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:59.140]
invented golf so what does that tell you are you a golf person I I was gonna say I played I

[00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:02.800]
don't know if I was ever good enough to say I played golf but I just got to know you know

[00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:06.900]
and it's you not oh you I'm playing a couple years but we you know I mean the friends just got

[00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:14.140]
there how some fun you know kind of kick a ball around as good as you could so I can say we

[00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:17.760]
probably wrecked a couple golf carts well good I'm glad to hear it an astray public Saturday

[00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:22.720]
in the daily records Smith was quoted as saying even Hitler didn't wake up going let me do the most

[00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:27.120]
evil thing I can do today I think he woke up in the morning using a twisted backwards logic he

[00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:30.960]
said out to do what he thought was good well guess what come over here Will I got to sharpen

[00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:36.720]
knife let me do what I think is good I got a gun here will the quote was preceded by the writer's

[00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:41.900]
observation remarkably will believes everyone is basically good over the week I guess he never

[00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:46.360]
worked in this business over the weekend doesn't this celebrity gossip websites posted articles

[00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:51.100]
about the comment many saying that Smith believe that Hitler was a good person it's an awful and

[00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:56.740]
disgusting lie Smith said in the statement provided by his publicist to the Monday it speaks to

[00:19:56.740 --> 00:20:02.120]
the dangerous power of an ignorant person with a pen I mean incensed and infuriated to have

[00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:08.660]
responded such ludicrous misinterpretation it all Hitler was a vile heinous vicious killer responsible

[00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:12.340]
for the greatest act of evil committed on this planet where the statement although I did like his

[00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:18.300]
cookies his heinous heinous you like famous aim is a little chip oh come on you can eat

[00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:42.220]
bag famous aim this man that's what I'm in my right or what I can't understand anything he's saying

[00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:46.140]
Santa Claus is real don't tell me anything otherwise okay I can't even understand

[00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:50.960]
it I don't sound the same you're looking he's in good form today though it's good he's like my

[00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:54.580]
pen pal today at least we got somebody calling in there we should get a lot of calls here today

[00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:59.580]
so they have to Christmas no more excuses now I would think a lot of people would be calling in

[00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:04.660]
especially enough the papiates are 15 and the oh and it often is lost again well that was the

[00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:11.440]
game I mean oh there's no a contender when no contest it was a a walkover and this crap about well

[00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:16.380]
what do you think the giants are gonna be really motivated for that game the giants suck okay an

[00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:22.600]
Eli Manning he is the epitome of suck he's so bad so pathetic he's like a bad high school quarterback

[00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:29.680]
he's no reason to me why they stink so bad is there any argument about that no 52 votes on the

[00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:35.240]
pool after I die expect to honestly I have no clue 25 go outside step on a couple of incidents

[00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:44.480]
so thinking about look at his anything about until he read for his leader

[00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:55.080]
you know bearing in Lebanon and most of the Yankees day out of peligro in chasing gmb

[00:21:55.080 --> 00:22:02.320]
But do you recall the most juiced up picture of all?

[00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:07.100]
Clemens, the juiced up rocket, will make the honor fend cuts

[00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:11.400]
Because they don't be picture, had a kneeling in his butt

[00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:16.200]
All of the baseball riders, like a guy whose pee is clean

[00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:20.980]
They're never let forager, get to their coupers, how seen

[00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:25.540]
One day in the locker room, Clemens showed no class

[00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:30.520]
He said to his trainer, guys shoot some steroids in my ass

[00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:35.240]
He got a bunch of strikeouts, we all bought, he was run free

[00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:39.780]
And the rocket is still playing, even though he's 83

[00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:43.120]
Okay, 1032 and 560, it won't be QAM

[00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:47.080]
Not getting much response on the phone here today, I guess it's Boxing Day and so forth, do you think?

[00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:50.960]
Yeah, probably not

[00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:54.700]
I'm just looking to the store to take stuff back, which I guess isn't Friday the big day for you and then?

[00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:59.220]
The Friday after Christmas, well whatever, now I want to give you a little sample so you know that I'm not making it up

[00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:00.760]
Of what I'm hearing on this end

[00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:05.060]
It's the Metro PCS Orange Bowl basketball classic, the Bank of Latinx set

[00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:09.200]
For tickets called 305-414-702, what does it look like?

[00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:11.280]
I got their Orange Bowl, limiting your best

[00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:13.540]
Are you ready for some football?

[00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:17.060]
That's pretty fun, okay, well that's pretty fun there

[00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:22.600]
Hey, it's kind of like the Chinese water treatment, you know, I think it's part of a well, we're going to drive in crazy, I like that

[00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:25.360]
I don't care, it doesn't bother me, I'm used to, we've had this many times before

[00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:28.660]
But the bizarre thing is that it just comes out of nowhere

[00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:29.240]
Yeah

[00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:34.540]
I mean, everything was fine and just like normal, like a regular ordinary day when things aren't totally screwed up

[00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:38.800]
And all of a sudden that, like that, spastic, that would be QAM, hello

[00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:39.960]
Hey, how are you doing, buddy?

[00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:41.380]
Yes, sir, happy new year

[00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:42.400]
Happy new year, kid

[00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:44.140]
Hey, Jared, Joe Rogues, show this morning

[00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:45.840]
Did I hear Jolly Joe know?

[00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:51.040]
I bet it was 100% better with Jason Jackson on there

[00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:51.800]
Yeah

[00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:56.300]
Well, yeah, one of the nooses around Joe's neck they took out, that's a good move I think

[00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:58.240]
Yeah, it's a great move, next to move

[00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:00.060]
I thought I got the same meal

[00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:01.020]
Okay, thanks

[00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:04.740]
And Jason Jackson says happy new year too, by the way, Jack's jerks, whatever his name is

[00:24:04.740 --> 00:24:07.540]
He's going to be doing two to four and then the mad dogs going back to four to seven

[00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:11.840]
Starting January the turn, or the second, whatever, next Wednesday

[00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:12.720]
Second

[00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:15.940]
Like I said, next Wednesday, what day is next Wednesday?

[00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:16.620]
The second

[00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:18.280]
Right, like I said, exactly

[00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:21.500]
Sixty-six votes already on the pool, how do you like that?

[00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:22.840]
We got a shout out to 100 today

[00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:24.360]
Oh, right, on Boxing Day

[00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:25.720]
WQAM, hello

[00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:28.460]
Good afternoon, actually good morning, Neil

[00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:29.540]
Good evening, sir, yes

[00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:30.620]
Hi, how are you doing?

[00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:38.400]
As a professor's Catholic, I just want to let you know, before the year's end, you will burn hell and Jesus will light the flame

[00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:40.840]
I'm looking forward to it

[00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:41.640]
Okay, bye-bye

[00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:42.260]
Thank you

[00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:46.020]
I'm going to burn in hell, you're going to burn down there, mister

[00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:51.300]
Or like Linda Blair said, you're going to die up there, and then she peed on the floor, remember that in the exorcist?

[00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:52.020]
Not, I remember

[00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:54.480]
Do you remember the priest was playing the piano?

[00:24:55.060 --> 00:25:01.520]
I have only seen the exorcist once, and the pilot was there, and she comes down the stairs in her nightgown

[00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:05.220]
And she stands and looks at him and says, you're going to die up there

[00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:08.880]
And they all kind of like, look, stop what they're doing and take a look

[00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:11.880]
And then she proceeds to pee on the floor on the carpet

[00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:12.840]
I don't remember the part

[00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:17.160]
Well, I hope you could possibly have seen the exorcist and not remember that part

[00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:20.980]
Because I remember going down the stairs spider-style, so

[00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:22.020]
You know what that's like?

[00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:26.440]
That's like saying, I saw the exorcist, but I don't remember the part where they were all yelling

[00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:29.340]
That's a problem, Christ, don't press your back

[00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:31.300]
You know, how is that possible?

[00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:35.060]
Well, you just, you just dumb WQAM, hello

[00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:35.740]
Hey Neil

[00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:36.540]
Yes sir

[00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:39.560]
I can't believe they're going to give that to Jason Jackson, they should have gave it to Curtis

[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:40.320]
Yeah

[00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:41.840]
Because then Curtis and, uh,

[00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:44.460]
Well you know something sir, that's what they're doing

[00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:46.600]
You know what I mean? In other words, that's what they're going to do

[00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:49.540]
And we consider it say, oh, they should have done this, they should have done that

[00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:53.260]
But that's not what they're doing, it's going to be Jason Jerk's two to four

[00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:55.920]
Wow, because then, him and Curtis could have done the power hour

[00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:56.340]
Yeah

[00:25:56.340 --> 00:25:57.800]
Oh man, I don't get it

[00:25:57.800 --> 00:25:59.080]
Alright buddy, good luck to you

[00:25:59.080 --> 00:25:59.440]
Okay

[00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:04.520]
Everybody's a program director, there's no question about that, it's always been that way

[00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:05.160]
I always will

[00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:07.100]
Too bad not everybody's an engineer

[00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:09.180]
How many QAM, hello

[00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:11.820]
Hey, happy new year Neil, how you doing?

[00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:13.660]
Yes sir, and Jeffy New Year

[00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:15.240]
And happy 2008

[00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:20.920]
First of all, in the exorcist, she says you're all going to die up there, how long is that?

[00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:22.980]
She said you're all going to die up there?

[00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:24.380]
No, she didn't say that

[00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:28.340]
It's not what she said sir, go back and watch it again, okay, it'll keep you off the streets

[00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:31.360]
Kill some good time, watch it again, she says you're going to die up there

[00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:33.840]
Because the longer I was a pilot, she didn't say you're all going to die up there

[00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:39.360]
And even if she did, what differences to make is that the best you can do is nitpick, go nose pick, it's better nitpick, go butt pick

[00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:40.360]
Correct, you idiot

[00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:46.140]
73 votes on that poll about death and believe you me in some of your case, won't be soon enough

[00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:52.520]
5670560, 0560 and they've arrived in Singular, wireless line, what about those dolphins?

[00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:54.840]
Now who do they play the bangles the last game?

[00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:55.140]
Correct

[00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:56.520]
Hello

[00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:57.940]
Oh, you didn't hear the one I said correct

[00:26:57.940 --> 00:26:59.880]
No, it cut out, I didn't hear anything

[00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:01.380]
Yeah, they're playing the bangles at home here

[00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:02.760]
Oh boy, it's going to be okay

[00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:06.980]
Bangles sucko, the bangles are capable on their worst day of losing to the dolphins

[00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:07.500]
Correct

[00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:14.440]
That's true, they were extremely inconsistent, very disappointing and they generally suck so it ought to be like a suckfest

[00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:20.180]
So they got a chance to go 214 which would really be, can you imagine if they won a second game?

[00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:25.540]
Wow, you saw what happened when they won the first game against the offensively challenged Baltimore Ravens

[00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:28.580]
You saw what happened there and I think she'd actually win a second game

[00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:31.320]
There's no holding these guys back, man

[00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:32.340]
They'd be on a roll then

[00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:32.920]
What?

[00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:34.480]
They'd be on a roll, that'd be 2 out of 3

[00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:36.680]
Yeah, that's another good way to look at it

[00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:40.020]
2 out of 3, we have 667 average baby, we're on fire

[00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:41.820]
WQ William, hello

[00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:44.660]
Yeah, Neil, she did say you're all going to die up there

[00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:48.060]
But wasn't a pilot, he was a astronaut

[00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:50.900]
Oh, that's right, she said you're all going to die up there?

[00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:53.300]
Right, she said you're all going to die up there

[00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:56.120]
Yeah, well let me ask you this, what differences it make?

[00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:57.600]
Right, really it doesn't

[00:27:57.600 --> 00:27:59.660]
Okay, so why are you calling me to tell me that?

[00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:01.440]
I just wanted to say hi to you, Neil

[00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:06.120]
No, you didn't, you want to say hi to me, you wanted to be a nitpicker

[00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:08.940]
You made a mistake, you made a mistake

[00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:11.540]
Yeah, I made a lot of mistakes in my life, believe me

[00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:13.680]
Now wouldn't that be something if we could live our lives over?

[00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:16.680]
I'm not talking about a young punk like you Chris, I'm talking about like us old friends

[00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:19.960]
All these people, if I had to do it over, what you don't

[00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:22.500]
Do it right now because you're not going to get to do it over

[00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:25.820]
That's my best suggestion to all you clowns out there, all you punks

[00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:27.820]
You don't want to like in 30 or 40 years say

[00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:31.940]
Oh, if I could just live it all over again, well do it now, have a good time

[00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:35.140]
And don't wish that you wouldn't have had 20 years from now

[00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:38.440]
Oh, if I could just have done that because 20 years from now or 40 years from now

[00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:41.880]
You won't be able to do whatever it is you wanted to do like now

[00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:42.940]
Am I right? Yes

[00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:48.280]
88 votes, after I die, I honestly have no clue 44

[00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:49.440]
Well that makes me sad

[00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:52.160]
Become nothing more than worm food 21

[00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:54.740]
Have a good rest, 10, that's a good way to look at it

[00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:58.900]
Have a nice dirt nap, live on an afterlife 7, how silly that is

[00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:01.520]
Oh man's got a soul, he has a soul

[00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:05.220]
Bebe incarnated 5 and become a ghost 1

[00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:08.200]
Like Casper the Ghost, remember Casper?

[00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:10.520]
The friendly ghost? WDQA and hello

[00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:11.740]
Good morning Neil

[00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:13.420]
I remember Dick Casper, yes sir

[00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:15.640]
I wake up this morning, I turn on the radio

[00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:18.420]
And I hear that it's Miami Heat Talk from 2 to 4

[00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:19.960]
God help us all man

[00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:20.340]
It's what?

[00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:23.380]
Miami Heat Talk from 2 to 4 in the afternoon

[00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:28.640]
Yeah, is that all you people want to talk about is Jason Jertz, we already know how we know his story

[00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:30.440]
We know his story

[00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:32.200]
The best out of T-Rex

[00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:35.400]
4.5.50 QAM

[00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:37.180]
The sports leader

[00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:41.700]
Hello and welcome to a colorless fair

[00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:45.400]
Senator Larry Craig is facing new allegations about his past sexual behavior

[00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:48.680]
Some of these Idaho's statesman newspaper identifies four men

[00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:53.680]
who claim they either had sex with Larry Craig or were the subject of his sexual advances

[00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:56.540]
Senator Craig, what is your problem?

[00:29:56.940 --> 00:29:58.800]
I seek activity and bathroom

[00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:00.760]
Oh, you openly admit it

[00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:00.960]
Yes

[00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:03.420]
The four guys, did you have sex with them?

[00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:03.700]
Yes

[00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:08.700]
Hot steamy man on man naked sweaty wrestling on the garage, four kind of sex

[00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:09.140]
Yes

[00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:10.500]
That's pre-teach

[00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:13.880]
Whoa, oh Larry, your foot's touching me

[00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:17.960]
Your foot came toward my mind, my name's Lord George, was that natural? I don't know

[00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:21.600]
Oh, that's not natural, dude, your foot unzipped my pants

[00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:22.660]
Yes, it did

[00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:28.120]
Senator Craig, unless you want to pull back a bloody stump, it'll be best to keep your feet to yourself

[00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:29.160]
Yeah, probably would

[00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:37.020]
He's got a wide stance in his pants, they have Larry Craig, you know how that story kind of like, I don't know, there's a lot of jokes about it but the actual story itself

[00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:38.160]
Just kind of vanished

[00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:38.780]
Uh-huh

[00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:41.040]
Whatever happened to Mark Foley, how is she doing?

[00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:41.760]
Who does?

[00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:47.300]
And whatever happened to your gay governor, I don't know, all these stories, they're like, he's dating that lady

[00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:49.080]
Oh, that's right, I forgot about that

[00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:50.820]
It looks like one

[00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:59.920]
Charlie, five, six, seven, oh five, six, eight, come on, you folks better get with it because Curtis and the V-Six today, uh, Christal me, the phones were smoking

[00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:00.620]
Yes

[00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:01.640]
Is that what you said?

[00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:07.920]
Yeah, and um, about 98% of it weren't, well, 98% were, were you know

[00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:08.860]
Yeah, well, you know, yeah

[00:31:08.860 --> 00:31:11.020]
But you said they were smoking, they were on fire

[00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:17.280]
Yeah, of course, we had to go home

[00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:20.400]
Yeah, now we had a real call here yet so far today, I'm not really too sure

[00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:21.920]
I think we won the last one

[00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:28.560]
I think one of the real callers were one of the, uh, the, uh, bar buddies of Curtis but hey, you know what I'm still a real call

[00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:30.340]
Oh, to that I don't have any bar buddies

[00:31:30.340 --> 00:31:31.280]
Yeah, see

[00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:32.720]
W-D-Q-A-M, hello

[00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:35.880]
Q-A-M

[00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:37.560]
How about Neil?

[00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:38.240]
Yes

[00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:40.480]
It has a Neil and Dale and until, first

[00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:42.680]
W-D-Q-A-M, hello

[00:31:43.620 --> 00:31:45.940]
Looking back, now we have a real call here yet so far today

[00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:46.420]
Q-A-M

[00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:47.280]
How are we going to do sure?

[00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:48.680]
I think we'll do the last one

[00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:50.600]
W-D-Q-A-M, hello

[00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:52.980]
Morning

[00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:53.780]
Morning

[00:31:53.780 --> 00:31:54.540]
How are you?

[00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:55.680]
Okay, how are you?

[00:31:56.160 --> 00:32:01.440]
Terrific, uh, do you suppose that in the actresses Linda Blair, which you said you're all going to die up there

[00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:04.220]
You think she might have meant Joe Bell and all the Q-A-M men

[00:32:04.220 --> 00:32:04.280]
Oh!

[00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:06.760]
W-D-Q-A-M, hello

[00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:10.240]
Yeah, I was having these people along the way at the same one note, Charlie, three left

[00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:11.160]
Q-A-M, hello

[00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:11.740]
Three left?

[00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:12.760]
Yeah

[00:32:13.220 --> 00:32:15.740]
You played a bit Christmas day

[00:32:15.740 --> 00:32:17.140]
Well, let me ask you a question

[00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:17.520]
Yeah

[00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:18.600]
Oh, this sounds like Reverend Jones

[00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:20.780]
No, I don't know who he is, but you play it

[00:32:20.780 --> 00:32:22.440]
Yeah, this is Reverend Jones, yeah

[00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:25.700]
You know, he always responds with the same thing, I don't know who he is

[00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:26.420]
Uh-huh

[00:32:26.420 --> 00:32:27.140]
You ever know what's that?

[00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:27.480]
Yep

[00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:28.900]
I don't know who he is, and you know what?

[00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:31.000]
I do know who he is and believe you me

[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:32.660]
If I had the opportunity

[00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:33.660]
Screamless?

[00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:35.860]
Screamless, like you can hear the accent in his voice

[00:32:35.860 --> 00:32:38.340]
Yes, Screamless, four hours of it

[00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:39.300]
A year of it

[00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:41.920]
Every single day, and you can rest assured, man

[00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:44.900]
Well, I mean, all depends on it, I want to make a centaurian declaration

[00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:48.740]
But I don't think you're going to have to be screaming calls, it's just no fun that way, boy

[00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:49.900]
It takes the fun out of life

[00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:51.800]
Well, whatever you want to do, it's fine with me

[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:54.640]
Oh, great

[00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:56.540]
W-D-Q-A-M, hello

[00:32:56.960 --> 00:32:57.500]
You're good

[00:32:57.880 --> 00:32:58.540]
Yes, sir

[00:32:58.540 --> 00:33:01.120]
Um, happy holidays to you

[00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:01.980]
Back to you

[00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:05.480]
Just want to get in the way back machine and remember when you first started at this station

[00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:09.180]
After you're seven months off, and how excited you were to get there

[00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:11.680]
Broke up, I didn't hear a damn thing you said

[00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:15.680]
Oh, when you initially started at this station

[00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:17.440]
After you're seven months hiatus

[00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:18.000]
Right

[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.440]
You had some new equipment and you were really pumped up

[00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:23.020]
And the listeners were pumped up, it was very exciting

[00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:26.240]
It's just very sad to see what it's called out

[00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:27.600]
You didn't even get into it yet, well

[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:31.480]
Cold lack of maintenance, lack of caring is what it's called, but this way it goes

[00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:34.700]
But the exciting, on the other hand, is here's open behind the scenes

[00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:39.760]
That, you know, be a satellite, be a FM, you're a valuable commodity

[00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:44.380]
And it'd be, maybe it's out there for someone not to pick you up and let you run

[00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:48.280]
Okay, well, well, think about that in about a year, okay, when the time comes

[00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:52.840]
So all they want to talk about is, oh, you're leaving at a year, okay, you're in a week

[00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:54.700]
53 weeks, okay?

[00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:57.000]
Jesus, God Almighty

[00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.400]
Just, it's really pathetic, isn't it?

[00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:00.040]
Sad

[00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:01.160]
Well, they're getting choked up already

[00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:02.800]
Are they really yet choked this?

[00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:06.000]
104 on your full, not too bad about death, death

[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.180]
I'm dying on the hand

[00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:10.240]
I don't know what to think, they've told me that we're going to have an afterlife

[00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:13.760]
And we're going to be with the Lord and all that other crap, all that other crap

[00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:16.780]
We're going to be with Jesus, how's Jeske doing?

[00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:17.360]
Who?

[00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:19.180]
How many QAM, hello?

[00:34:19.180 --> 00:34:20.560]
5-1-1, come on!

[00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:21.920]
WDQ-A-M, hello

[00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:22.880]
I knew

[00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:23.560]
Yes, sir

[00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:26.120]
Hey, look, I'm calling a representative of L

[00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:28.720]
It's like you know the chest is in the mail, okay?

[00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:29.300]
Yeah

[00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:29.920]
Okay

[00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:36.860]
5670560, pound 560 in the Verizon singular wireless line WDQ-A-M, hello

[00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:38.760]
You're going to be with Jesus Christ

[00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:39.800]
QAM

[00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:41.960]
Hey, Nail, could you play Bommel?

[00:34:42.340 --> 00:34:42.700]
No

[00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:45.500]
Yeah, could you play Bommel?

[00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:46.880]
I can go have one, how do you like that?

[00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:48.340]
I think we just heard one

[00:34:48.340 --> 00:34:51.720]
Now you told me the great calls were coming in yesterday, it must be me

[00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:53.780]
I'm going to say that in four hours

[00:34:53.780 --> 00:34:57.780]
No, you said that the calls were sensational, they've been in calls and they were great

[00:34:57.780 --> 00:35:00.980]
And they were talking about solving the future of the universe and mankind

[00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:02.020]
And yeah, that's a great word

[00:35:02.020 --> 00:35:03.520]
All sort of crap, you know what you said?

[00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:04.260]
Oh exactly

[00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:08.820]
You said the beast was just like a genius on what I show you yesterday is what you said

[00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:10.840]
I'm sorry, you broke up there, I didn't hear what you said

[00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:15.620]
It must be a two-way illness

[00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:20.140]
I mean, it's a little bit annoying, especially on the calls, but like that

[00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:23.100]
But you know, you do the best you can out of the circumstances, that's all

[00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:24.880]
I never played that missing anything, I'm used to it

[00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:26.120]
WDQ-A-M, hello

[00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:32.200]
Nail, about three years ago you were doing a show from Toronto, like you always do

[00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:36.720]
And you lost your power supply out there and you did the show for the phone or the cell phone

[00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:37.480]
Yeah

[00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:41.080]
That was one of my favorite new commercial phones

[00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:43.820]
Good, I'll get on the cell phone and call in, Huzanne

[00:35:43.820 --> 00:35:44.880]
Thank you, sir

[00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:45.840]
No problem

[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:49.360]
Oh, you got to love it

[00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:52.060]
I do love it, I love each and every one of these people

[00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:56.020]
Each and every one has got their own special thing, most of it's sick and rotting and festering

[00:35:56.020 --> 00:36:00.820]
Like a pus-filled sore, but nonetheless, one twelfth on the pole, not too bad, not too shamby

[00:36:00.820 --> 00:36:01.520]
Think about death

[00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:05.000]
Let's think, remember that song by Bob Lumin, let's think about living

[00:36:05.540 --> 00:36:06.980]
Who was that Bob Lumin? I remember

[00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:10.220]
Somebody will call and say, you're all going to die up there is what she said

[00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:13.440]
Okay, she said, you're all going to, who cares what she said

[00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:16.640]
And then she peed on the carpet, that was the most important thing

[00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:19.420]
And of course when she said, you're all going to die up there, they all stopped and looked like

[00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:22.380]
Oh, with the priest sitting there tickling on the piano, no less

[00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:24.780]
You don't remember that scene, the priest was playing the piano?

[00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:27.220]
I think I remember the priest playing the piano, I don't remember

[00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:29.380]
I can't say I remember her coming out

[00:36:29.380 --> 00:36:34.740]
The priest said that he wanted to be a headliner on Broadway and blah blah blah blah blah

[00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:37.720]
And he's playing the piano and watching the old time

[00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:40.780]
And all of a sudden, Flindablair comes wobbling down and stands there

[00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:44.560]
With that evil look on her purse, she's great, I love Linda Blair

[00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:46.060]
You like Linda Blair? You better?

[00:36:46.900 --> 00:36:47.980]
Somebody QA and hello

[00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:50.100]
What's going on? What's going on, Neil? Hi

[00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:53.140]
I just celebrate Christmas, I'm not religious, I just like the event

[00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:55.660]
But I know there's no Santa, no Jesus, no God

[00:36:55.660 --> 00:36:59.000]
Because if there was, I would have got my double pump action red, right or BB gun

[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:02.080]
That I never get, and these sugar plums are just dancing in my head

[00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:04.240]
And I can't get them out, I'm just going to loco

[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:06.100]
Somebody QA and hello

[00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:09.580]
It's Joe Rose, you next and Jason

[00:37:10.100 --> 00:37:11.040]
Somebody QA and hello?

[00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:12.620]
Neil, yes

[00:37:12.620 --> 00:37:16.620]
Yes, you're a show with sensation, it was really great, I'll come over round

[00:37:21.940 --> 00:37:25.440]
Oh I'm sure they loved it, they were only on what, 6, 7,000 times a piece?

[00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:27.460]
Yes, I'm like that, and that's not too bad

[00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:31.200]
And then they had some blind girl that supposedly a friend of theirs called up in a hall judge when I think so stupid

[00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:31.780]
Really?

[00:37:32.380 --> 00:37:32.880]
Oh yeah, I was great

[00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:34.560]
How do you know she's blind? Because she said she was

[00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:38.320]
Let me say it again, have you read it? If you said anything, it cut out

[00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:40.520]
Oh, that's that because she said she was

[00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:43.780]
Oh, well that proves it to me, exactly, nobody lies, do they?

[00:37:44.140 --> 00:37:46.640]
Especially not them, nobody QA and hello

[00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:51.600]
Neil, good morning, I have a shameless request sir, but it relates to your poll

[00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:56.680]
You used to do a bit, dead, dead, dead, someday you'll be dead

[00:37:56.680 --> 00:37:59.720]
How many times have you played that over the holiday season sir?

[00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:02.180]
At least a thousand, and we played it yesterday, too

[00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:03.580]
And they played it yesterday?

[00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:05.100]
Are you caught me with my pants down there?

[00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:06.700]
Yeah, well we don't want to do that again

[00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:09.580]
Oh okay, there he goes

[00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:13.720]
Not thanks anyway, or thanks and have a great new year, like that

[00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:17.240]
Jesus, God, I'm a friendly man

[00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:19.320]
Dead, dead, dead, sour

[00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:21.080]
Someday you'll be dead

[00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:21.880]
Hostile

[00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:24.840]
Dead, dead, dead, someday we'll all

[00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:29.700]
He said you're all gonna die up there, that's what Linda said, you're wrong Neil

[00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:33.820]
The make were born, we start dying, we die a little more every day

[00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:39.800]
Young were old, richer poor, there's nothing we can do to stop it

[00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:45.820]
Sorry, look long at that Christmas tree, it may be the last one that you see

[00:38:46.660 --> 00:38:50.620]
Decorate your house in green and red, cause someday you'll be dead

[00:38:50.620 --> 00:38:55.320]
Dead, dead, dead, someday you'll be dead

[00:38:55.320 --> 00:39:00.100]
Dead, dead, dead, someday we'll all be dead

[00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:01.500]
I'm dying out of here

[00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:02.620]
Absolutely

[00:39:03.620 --> 00:39:08.100]
It might happen in a couple months or 50 years from now

[00:39:08.620 --> 00:39:13.620]
But no matter when it happens, it will seem too soon to you

[00:39:14.580 --> 00:39:19.080]
So be sure on Christmas Eve when you snuggle in to bed

[00:39:20.020 --> 00:39:24.760]
That you think I'd for your family, cause someday there'll be dead

[00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:29.320]
Oh, dead, dead, dead, someday there'll be dead

[00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:34.140]
Oh, dead, dead, dead, someday we'll all be dead

[00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:41.640]
Who knows how many Christmas is left in their short life

[00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:47.020]
Nobody knows, that's my point, enjoy the while you can

[00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:52.680]
And so on Christmas morning, let good times go your hand

[00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:58.140]
What a festive season, someday you'll be dead

[00:39:58.140 --> 00:40:02.940]
Dead, dead, dead, someday we'll be dead

[00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:07.020]
Dead, dead, dead, everyone you know, dead

[00:40:07.220 --> 00:40:13.560]
A very Merry Christmas to you, down, down

[00:40:19.260 --> 00:40:22.480]
Merry Christmas everybody

[00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:24.480]
What biggest name?

[00:40:24.740 --> 00:40:26.900]
The best out of two Christmas nail projects

[00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:29.300]
4.50QAM

[00:40:29.300 --> 00:40:31.100]
The sports leader

[00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:34.440]
This is the Neoronger show

[00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:37.120]
This is your blind

[00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:39.440]
This is your blind

[00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:42.140]
I think it's an honor to be a Romano

[00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:45.440]
But I definitely just hope that I'm a good Romano

[00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:48.120]
And I hope that I'm a Romano for some kids out there

[00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:51.600]
I kinda think it's disgusting, I think she's like farming her sister's footsteps

[00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:53.180]
And she shouldn't be just a joke

[00:40:53.180 --> 00:40:56.320]
I feel like that whole family's like a circus now, it's awful, it's her what

[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:01.660]
You're too young and we all look mean, you'll see

[00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:06.020]
You've been a really dumb girl, Jamie's baby

[00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:08.000]
You act a lot like Britney

[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:09.820]
I have a younger sister, she watches that show

[00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:12.920]
It's the way 101, I think that's good role model for her to look up to

[00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:16.960]
Jamie's baby, the TV show they will love renew

[00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:22.580]
The national choir you try to sue

[00:41:22.580 --> 00:41:24.580]
Stop trying to be Britney

[00:41:24.580 --> 00:41:26.940]
She's so much attention that's been focused on Britney

[00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:29.700]
And now that the camera lens is shifting a bit

[00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:58.100]
Oh God, you're acting like Britney

[00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:01.600]
There's a hint of survival right here

[00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:02.980]
Oh, it has this one is

[00:42:02.980 --> 00:42:06.120]
Maybe it just runs into family, can you say slut, can you spell it?

[00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:09.340]
111 at 560 WQM, did I do the schedule for today or what?

[00:42:09.540 --> 00:42:10.120]
No, I did not

[00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:11.700]
I think you did, but who knows?

[00:42:11.980 --> 00:42:12.660]
No, I did not

[00:42:12.660 --> 00:42:13.920]
Then you didn't

[00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:16.960]
Don't you think I would have remembered John Linder and the Troy Dremier or Cuff?

[00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:17.840]
I would have remembered that

[00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:19.780]
Curtis for the mad dog 2 to 4

[00:42:19.780 --> 00:42:22.860]
Power R with a Humper, then that's why I did start to do it

[00:42:22.860 --> 00:42:25.320]
And then I get sidetracked because I asked how many days is the Humper I got left

[00:42:26.180 --> 00:42:28.300]
Today, tomorrow, Friday and Monday

[00:42:28.300 --> 00:42:29.660]
Four more days of the Humper

[00:42:29.660 --> 00:42:31.360]
And then he's out the door

[00:42:31.820 --> 00:42:32.680]
You guys set up a cake?

[00:42:33.340 --> 00:42:37.340]
I think you ought to be on the air with me like on Monday for a few minutes

[00:42:37.340 --> 00:42:38.220]
Wouldn't that be a good idea?

[00:42:38.380 --> 00:42:39.240]
Stop, people try to get it done

[00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:40.200]
Can you set that up?

[00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:43.720]
I haven't called in on the bat line, we can confangulate

[00:42:44.300 --> 00:42:47.140]
Dolphins all access with John under what's his name?

[00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:48.680]
Dunder, John Linder

[00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:50.560]
Linder and Troy Dremier from 7-0

[00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:53.480]
Well I have my glasses sitting on that part of the schedule I can't read on it

[00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:56.860]
You know, it's not really worth moving because it's a requires effort

[00:42:56.860 --> 00:42:58.440]
And then the beast from 9-0 midnight

[00:42:58.440 --> 00:43:03.000]
And the amazing part about that is he's still wondering out loud as he actually got that shift or not

[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:03.360]
Who knows?

[00:43:03.820 --> 00:43:04.820]
That's what he was saying

[00:43:04.820 --> 00:43:05.720]
That's what he was saying

[00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:08.000]
I don't think he's on the inside anymore, I think he's on the outs

[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:09.780]
Maybe he got clearance off since he got married

[00:43:09.780 --> 00:43:11.960]
This is a good article from Camp on Hill Blue

[00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:14.000]
I don't know who wrote it because it doesn't have a byline

[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:16.000]
I know it wasn't Doug Thompson, I don't think but it's great

[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:17.640]
It's good, not great, it's good

[00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:20.760]
It says what went wrong with CNN?

[00:43:21.540 --> 00:43:25.060]
Forget about Fox, that station has no business even putting news in its title

[00:43:25.060 --> 00:43:29.000]
At least with his newspapers, Rupert manages to give box scores on local teams

[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:32.860]
On Fox News, even the pretence of reporting seriously on news items is gone

[00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:34.600]
And once it's gone, it's gone

[00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:38.700]
NBC is hardly better, Chris Matthews isn't just irritating

[00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:43.480]
He has this bad habit of falling in love with a candidate on terms which are nothing less than ridiculous

[00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:46.880]
Fred Thompson is a manly man, Joe Biden is what?

[00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:48.220]
Huckabee is the real what?

[00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:50.760]
At least MSNBC tries to redeem itself

[00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:54.080]
Joe Scarborough does hard news in an unfortunate early morning format

[00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:57.440]
But a save by real journalist, his cohort Meeka, I don't know who that is

[00:43:57.440 --> 00:43:59.440]
You ever watch Joe Scarborough? I don't

[00:43:59.440 --> 00:43:59.620]
Nope

[00:43:59.620 --> 00:44:03.260]
The evening is beginning with Keith Obramon and Dan Abramsphere are far better

[00:44:03.260 --> 00:44:05.260]
They actually report details and stories

[00:44:05.260 --> 00:44:10.160]
Once Tucker is put into his grave, this station may yet return to respectable news reporting we shall see

[00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:12.740]
CNN is the true disappointment

[00:44:13.340 --> 00:44:13.820]
Absolutely

[00:44:13.820 --> 00:44:18.820]
Not only is Wolf Blitzkrieg taking a potentially useful format and turned it into Clinton life

[00:44:18.820 --> 00:44:24.140]
When they do decide to report on say the campaign, they do such a lousy surface-only job that you get your feeling

[00:44:24.140 --> 00:44:25.660]
You just bought a box of air

[00:44:25.660 --> 00:44:28.900]
Poles clothing and gantt discussions, but no substance

[00:44:28.900 --> 00:44:31.660]
CNN no longer does journalism, it does entertainment

[00:44:31.660 --> 00:44:33.200]
And poor entertainment at that

[00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:36.900]
And should another blonde bimbo go missing from a vacation on a tropical island

[00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:38.860]
Or should OJ become a topic again

[00:44:38.860 --> 00:44:41.780]
Even forget about even the slightest hint of real news

[00:44:41.780 --> 00:44:43.980]
CNN is the industry's embarrassment

[00:44:43.980 --> 00:44:45.380]
Absolutely correct

[00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:47.660]
Excellent, right on target man

[00:44:47.660 --> 00:44:50.200]
When a doubt take it out, CNN blow up their towers

[00:44:50.620 --> 00:44:52.280]
Get there and get them off the satellite

[00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:55.300]
It's the only hope for the future of the human race you do understand that don't you?

[00:44:55.300 --> 00:44:59.020]
Yeah, you're with a religion first and then CNN second, then you got it leaked

[00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:00.640]
Nobody QAM, hello

[00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:03.660]
Who I like, listen to the sound of that

[00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:05.280]
Mm-hmm

[00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:06.140]
Is that a good one?

[00:45:06.460 --> 00:45:06.900]
Oh, wonderful

[00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:11.260]
5.6705.60, pound 5.60 on the Verizon singular wireless line

[00:45:11.260 --> 00:45:14.280]
It's the end of the year, the 7.26, you only got five days left

[00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:15.900]
Time to get it off your chest

[00:45:16.540 --> 00:45:17.580]
WDQ, why am hello

[00:45:18.040 --> 00:45:19.920]
Yeah, uh, yeah, please

[00:45:20.560 --> 00:45:20.960]
Speaking

[00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:22.580]
Oh, yeah, how are you?

[00:45:23.100 --> 00:45:23.500]
Sorry

[00:45:25.060 --> 00:45:27.260]
Um, get someone to say, uh, me too

[00:45:27.260 --> 00:45:28.080]
Me too

[00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:28.740]
Yeah, hello

[00:45:28.740 --> 00:45:29.380]
Yeah

[00:45:29.980 --> 00:45:34.060]
Okay, I just, I'm on the radio, but I don't think I'm speaking to me, am I?

[00:45:34.940 --> 00:45:37.660]
Yeah, go ahead sir, speak now or hold your piece forever

[00:45:37.660 --> 00:45:41.340]
Okay, fine, uh, on the radio, you just get to know the voice, I guess

[00:45:41.340 --> 00:45:46.020]
Yeah, I was something forget about the radio, talk into the phone, the thing with the holes in it, talk into the phone like a human being

[00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:47.160]
Okay, but speak to me

[00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:53.180]
I just wanted to say, uh, I hope you're not space about all that, all that bull about, uh, dying in hell and all that

[00:45:53.180 --> 00:45:58.340]
Because, uh, God, it's not a God of punishment, it's not a God of tormenting

[00:45:58.340 --> 00:46:00.560]
Yeah, he, it, them, they, okay

[00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:05.520]
But I beat that a boop at about, no wonder we're talking to a, a dill head man, a dumbo

[00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:11.120]
If you've had to pot on a calls down lower than usual or so, I turned it up and down when he was, uh, feedbacking

[00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:12.260]
I thought, I pushed the back up

[00:46:12.260 --> 00:46:16.480]
When we was trying to find a life when he had the SSL party on the flashlights going, didn't find it, believe me

[00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:22.220]
If there's a God sir and if there's a hell, I guarantee you he's gonna put your ass into it, I guarantee you that

[00:46:22.220 --> 00:46:23.560]
You're gonna rot in hell

[00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:27.960]
And I, you know, I read some of these comments that he's hailed in sunset and the articles that have been in the last couple of weeks

[00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:32.200]
I read some of the swillets written on it, which, you know, you know, there are a lot of people out there that hate you like poison

[00:46:32.700 --> 00:46:42.400]
And which is fine, but this crap about ol' and while Neil and Hiker are so rude to the carers, only you people, only everybody out there should have to talk to these people every day of your life

[00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:45.400]
I would, in fact, I take that back, I wouldn't wish that on anybody

[00:46:45.400 --> 00:46:46.020]
You sure?

[00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:50.700]
Trust me, he even knew, you know, as I'm not making your screen a cause, that I thank you for

[00:46:51.180 --> 00:46:51.860]
WQA and hello

[00:46:51.860 --> 00:46:52.920]
Needle, how you doing?

[00:46:53.240 --> 00:46:53.700]
Okay sir

[00:46:54.040 --> 00:47:01.660]
Hey listen, I just want to say a couple things to you one, I know how you hate when people suck up to you and everything, but I've been with me since I was eight years old, I've been with you for the last 20-something years

[00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:05.820]
And you've been entertained me down here and this town now is terrible

[00:47:05.820 --> 00:47:15.640]
I can't believe this is happening, this is a joke, a few AMs a joke, and I just don't understand Neil, I mean I just don't understand what's going on, maybe you could just explain a little to me, because I've been able to explain what

[00:47:15.640 --> 00:47:17.380]
I could explain what

[00:47:17.380 --> 00:47:19.500]
Like what happened, the final thing that happened

[00:47:19.860 --> 00:47:24.520]
The final thing that happened is I'm sitting here right now and I'm doing a show and we'll continue doing it for another year

[00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:28.580]
Neil, listen man, I love you, you know I'm not, you know, I'm saying I'm great

[00:47:28.580 --> 00:47:30.300]
Not sucking up, I know, you're not homosexual

[00:47:30.300 --> 00:47:35.540]
I love you and I got to tell you one last thing, I called up the beast, I told him that you thought he was terrible

[00:47:35.540 --> 00:47:43.120]
And he denied it, he thinks you think he's great, and he slowly starts down the air about you guys are friends, and he's great, and he's supportive

[00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:44.820]
Is he nuts or what?

[00:47:46.180 --> 00:47:46.860]
WQA and hello

[00:48:06.220 --> 00:48:13.580]
I was just wondering how long you keep it going, but I think probably forever, yeah probably, WQA and hello

[00:48:14.580 --> 00:48:17.560]
Hello, happy holidays from your friends at QAM

[00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:24.200]
Happy holidays, Neil, am I the 10th caller for the tickets for the dolphin?

[00:48:24.620 --> 00:48:29.980]
Yeah, okay, great, okay, go take a good animal sir, take a blueberry animal, get it out of your system

[00:48:30.580 --> 00:48:37.980]
The dropouts is really irritating on the calls, the rest of the stuff I don't care because we need to hear the spots, but and you I mean, yeah, goes without saying

[00:48:37.980 --> 00:48:48.040]
But the calls, you ever try to talk to anybody, have a conversation with go, oh, it's like the witch doctor, ooi, ooi, I think, I think, I'm a big brain like that

[00:48:48.040 --> 00:48:51.060]
Yeah, well, I'll be honest with you, improvement over some of these

[00:48:51.060 --> 00:48:54.580]
The lifeer was weak by the way, very weak, did you think he was weak?

[00:48:54.900 --> 00:49:03.360]
Yeah, but what's something different, so you know, it was different, I'll grant him that, the little creative, not good, 149 votes on our death pool, WQA and hello

[00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:04.740]
Neil, yes sir

[00:49:04.740 --> 00:49:12.580]
I just want to thank you a long time ago, about nine years ago, it gave me a bunch of season tickets to the Marlins games, and that was one of the greatest summers of my life

[00:49:12.580 --> 00:49:17.840]
Well, great, call up and thank you, would you please play the 95 song one last time?

[00:49:18.220 --> 00:49:23.820]
Yeah, all right, hold your breath, I'll tell you when to exhale, WQA and hello

[00:49:24.360 --> 00:49:25.320]
Neil, yes

[00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:29.380]
Hey, how you guys, happy days boys, hey

[00:49:29.380 --> 00:49:31.820]
Yeah, is it Neil?

[00:49:32.240 --> 00:49:36.180]
Yeah, I'm still here, I'm all shocking, but I'm still here, I'm waiting

[00:49:36.180 --> 00:49:40.420]
Hey, did you guys get any stocking stuffers from corporate dishes?

[00:49:40.860 --> 00:49:42.400]
No, we don't get, they don't do that

[00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:43.560]
They don't do that?

[00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:47.840]
No, no, they have this thing, it's called a brakto suffer, they do that better

[00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:54.040]
149 on a pool, why do I keep giving the number, how many votes? I mean, I don't know, it's because that number's guy

[00:49:54.040 --> 00:49:56.700]
You know, he doesn't give the numbers, he's mailing it in there

[00:49:56.700 --> 00:49:58.640]
I'll never forget that guy's lungs I live

[00:49:58.640 --> 00:50:02.640]
Well, that's good I think, remember he was on a ruler for a few days, and then all of a sudden he vanished

[00:50:03.020 --> 00:50:05.900]
Thankfully, when I ran out of stamps, WQA and hello

[00:50:06.260 --> 00:50:08.120]
There's no bags in the cap

[00:50:08.680 --> 00:50:09.360]
WQA and hello

[00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:11.360]
QA and hello

[00:50:13.340 --> 00:50:13.980]
Hola, hola

[00:50:14.920 --> 00:50:15.600]
WQA and hello

[00:50:16.980 --> 00:50:17.540]
Do you like?

[00:50:19.460 --> 00:50:22.580]
Yeah, I love when it cuts out, do I like what? Did he say something or what?

[00:50:22.580 --> 00:50:26.640]
No, he said, do you like when I'm in the spirit? Do I like what? He didn't say it, he just disappeared

[00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:28.200]
WQA and hello

[00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:33.940]
Better keep, please keep the old risers, please keep the old risers, the only of the greatest ever

[00:50:33.940 --> 00:50:35.640]
You've most been, I love you

[00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:37.820]
WQA and hello

[00:50:37.820 --> 00:50:39.860]
It's a problem, that ain't job or stuff

[00:50:40.620 --> 00:50:41.440]
WQA and hello

[00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:42.180]
I'm Neil

[00:50:42.180 --> 00:50:42.820]
Yes sir

[00:50:42.820 --> 00:50:45.480]
I'm not for sure, but I just avoid this one

[00:50:45.480 --> 00:50:46.880]
This is Reverend Jones again

[00:50:47.580 --> 00:50:48.600]
Reverend Jones again

[00:50:48.600 --> 00:50:49.060]
Who?

[00:50:49.460 --> 00:50:49.860]
Again

[00:50:49.860 --> 00:50:51.400]
What are you talking about?

[00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:51.980]
Again

[00:50:51.980 --> 00:50:53.240]
I'm saying it though

[00:50:53.940 --> 00:50:56.940]
I'm just, there's only one thing I want to save you, you, you listening carefully

[00:50:56.940 --> 00:50:57.640]
You're gay

[00:50:57.640 --> 00:51:01.540]
Okay, let's take a look at the poor result and just off throwing the numbers around

[00:51:01.540 --> 00:51:05.260]
This is okay, I enjoy it, enjoy it, get used to it, have a lot of fun

[00:51:05.260 --> 00:51:08.260]
Well I don't want to, I mean I've got a pile of stuff here and I will read some of them

[00:51:08.260 --> 00:51:10.560]
But I don't want to sit here and read on a holiday, that would be bad

[00:51:10.560 --> 00:51:15.580]
Oh all he does is read articles out of the newspaper, what kind of a stick and show is that?

[00:51:16.580 --> 00:51:18.060]
He used to be cutting edge

[00:51:18.060 --> 00:51:23.220]
I got news for if there's anybody who thinks that anything on terrestrial radio is ever going to be cutting edge again

[00:51:23.220 --> 00:51:25.000]
You're living in a dream world, okay?

[00:51:25.320 --> 00:51:26.880]
You're living in a dream world

[00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:30.320]
And since Howard's decided he's going to take all the money, he's serious

[00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:32.000]
That's what you're going to hear

[00:51:32.840 --> 00:51:35.580]
After I die, I expect a blank, that's our poll today

[00:51:35.580 --> 00:51:37.480]
Nice uplifting poll for the holidays

[00:51:37.480 --> 00:51:40.080]
I honestly have no clue, 69

[00:51:40.080 --> 00:51:42.960]
Become nothing more than worm food, 36

[00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:48.360]
And how do you present the worms eating your dying rotting, your dead rotting carcass?

[00:51:48.520 --> 00:51:49.780]
It's wonderful, it's wonderful

[00:51:49.780 --> 00:51:52.040]
Well whatever this is to make, you're going to be dead, you care?

[00:51:52.220 --> 00:51:52.960]
Of course not, 36

[00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:55.120]
At least there will be something useful there

[00:51:55.120 --> 00:51:58.040]
And in your case there will be a lot useful, a lot of flesh

[00:51:58.040 --> 00:51:59.940]
Have a good rest, 23

[00:51:59.940 --> 00:52:03.440]
Live on in an afterlife, 17 very silly people

[00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:10.720]
Oh yeah, now if you have any eyes or any brain or any ears or any mouth or any heart or any liver or any kidneys or any pupic

[00:52:10.720 --> 00:52:13.720]
But you're going to have an afterlife, you're going to go see God

[00:52:13.720 --> 00:52:15.180]
And you know what's going to turn out to be?

[00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:16.020]
Damn God

[00:52:16.440 --> 00:52:20.660]
I'll be re-encarnated, 7 and become a ghost, only 3

[00:52:21.180 --> 00:52:23.820]
The ghost things for kids, right? All the drive-delts?

[00:52:23.820 --> 00:52:27.760]
Now you want to see a really bad movie, we've ever seen Amityville Horror with James Brolin?

[00:52:28.220 --> 00:52:29.060]
No, I don't think so

[00:52:29.060 --> 00:52:33.360]
Good, you got some time to kill, you want to really get depressed, watch that, it's really bad

[00:52:33.360 --> 00:52:34.260]
Very bad

[00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:38.540]
The dollar's hidden 5 minutes on I don't even think it was 4.30

[00:52:38.540 --> 00:52:41.980]
I'm 60 km, 4th leader

[00:52:45.480 --> 00:52:46.120]
You...

[00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:53.100]
And now another holiday travel tip from Senator Edward Kennedy

[00:52:53.100 --> 00:52:55.300]
Here at Travel Tip, there are number 4

[00:52:55.300 --> 00:52:58.680]
They remember to steer into a-a-s-gid

[00:52:58.680 --> 00:53:02.100]
I'll say the cat, remember to steer into a-s-gid

[00:53:02.100 --> 00:53:06.320]
I am made a mistake of a steering away from a skier to a years' thought

[00:53:06.320 --> 00:53:10.020]
And wound up killing my passengers and there wasn't even snow

[00:53:10.580 --> 00:53:16.480]
What happened, it was there a unicorn jumped in front of my car and I swerved away

[00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:17.600]
Big mistake

[00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:22.040]
Being pretty short, my reflexes were what they should have been

[00:53:22.040 --> 00:53:27.380]
Of course on the upside, their unicorns are on the endangered species list and the hide I hid it

[00:53:27.380 --> 00:53:34.660]
I was probably looking at some fairly significant jail time or if they released a hearing in front of the Senate oversight committee

[00:53:35.380 --> 00:53:39.720]
Remember, after a drink or two unicorns can appear sexually inviting

[00:53:40.380 --> 00:53:47.460]
But please refrain from hopping on board much like the praying mantis after they may glove to you they will kill you and eat you

[00:53:47.460 --> 00:53:51.460]
Which will definitely put a damper on your holiday drinking

[00:53:51.460 --> 00:53:55.360]
The proceeding has been another holiday travel tip from Senator Edward Kennedy

[00:53:55.900 --> 00:53:59.440]
Okay, 1118 to 560 WQ, I'm happy a new year baby

[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:04.940]
And you know something I've decided, finally, I'm not that makes any difference what I think about it, just my opinion

[00:54:04.940 --> 00:54:07.220]
That there's nothing wrong with happy holidays

[00:54:07.220 --> 00:54:12.140]
All these crazy people like John Gibson and Bill O'Reilly, all these other far-bison maniacs on Fox

[00:54:12.140 --> 00:54:16.580]
Oh, they've taken Christ out of Christmas, it's a liberal conspiracy, yeah right

[00:54:16.580 --> 00:54:19.080]
Well, what's wrong with happy holidays, everybody says that now

[00:54:19.080 --> 00:54:21.060]
Yeah, there's so many holidays right now

[00:54:21.060 --> 00:54:25.220]
Yeah, it's just generic and it covers all the bases and it's just a nice sentiment happy holidays

[00:54:25.220 --> 00:54:29.060]
Enjoy whatever you do or not as the case may be if you don't celebrate any of them

[00:54:29.060 --> 00:54:33.900]
And there's nothing wrong with that, it's like tolerant, it's like, you know, acceptable

[00:54:34.480 --> 00:54:37.880]
Oh, you took the Christ out of Christmas for Christ's sakes

[00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:39.480]
WQA in, hello

[00:54:39.480 --> 00:54:40.420]
New Year's morning

[00:54:40.420 --> 00:54:44.220]
Yes sir, did you hear what they did to poor Curtis yesterday on the air?

[00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:45.080]
Did I what?

[00:54:45.420 --> 00:54:48.580]
Did you hear what they did to poor Curtis yesterday on the air?

[00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:49.600]
What about them?

[00:54:49.600 --> 00:54:54.020]
They made him sit down and watch this video on the internet, two girls one cup

[00:54:54.600 --> 00:54:55.340]
Yeah, okay, great

[00:54:56.960 --> 00:55:00.680]
Well, why does that keep coming back over and over and over again?

[00:55:00.700 --> 00:55:07.020]
And that's a problem with the American now, it's either Britney or her sister or the YouTube video, whichever you...

[00:55:07.020 --> 00:55:07.280]
Cute!

[00:55:07.500 --> 00:55:09.380]
Did you know they're talking about it the week? Do you hear?

[00:55:09.820 --> 00:55:10.380]
Am I right?

[00:55:10.940 --> 00:55:11.100]
Yeah

[00:55:11.100 --> 00:55:16.100]
Same oral, tired, swill, crap, God

[00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:18.140]
WQA, I'm hello

[00:55:18.140 --> 00:55:18.720]
Hello

[00:55:18.720 --> 00:55:19.440]
Here?

[00:55:19.900 --> 00:55:20.440]
Yes

[00:55:21.140 --> 00:55:22.460]
Quad Great in the game

[00:55:23.300 --> 00:55:23.940]
Okay

[00:55:27.060 --> 00:55:27.700]
Hello

[00:55:27.700 --> 00:55:28.600]
Oh

[00:55:30.260 --> 00:55:30.980]
That's good

[00:55:30.980 --> 00:55:36.360]
See if you wait long enough sometimes there's a jackpot or maybe just a crankpot

[00:55:36.360 --> 00:55:37.920]
WQA in, hello

[00:55:37.920 --> 00:55:38.480]
Neil

[00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:39.440]
Yes sir

[00:55:39.440 --> 00:55:41.860]
It's just close to show you this town right here

[00:55:41.860 --> 00:55:44.700]
When you were reading things and you were talking about issues

[00:55:45.560 --> 00:55:49.840]
I listened every single day, I mean you were talking about the war, you were doing what opened about it

[00:55:49.840 --> 00:55:51.900]
People, town they don't care

[00:55:51.900 --> 00:55:55.720]
They'd rather listen to people calling and make stupid signals or stupid sounds

[00:55:55.720 --> 00:55:56.220]
Right

[00:55:56.220 --> 00:55:57.540]
It was serious this, that's correct

[00:55:57.540 --> 00:55:58.000]
That is correct

[00:55:58.600 --> 00:56:00.100]
That's why we're in situation we're in

[00:56:00.700 --> 00:56:03.560]
You should do a little bit more reading, you should educate the few that are...

[00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:05.820]
Oh yeah, I should educate the few right

[00:56:05.820 --> 00:56:08.680]
I know how it's hard, but you have done a good job

[00:56:08.680 --> 00:56:12.340]
You have stuff like the issues or great talk show host

[00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:14.680]
I'm gonna miss you Neil, I'm gonna miss you a lot

[00:56:14.680 --> 00:56:18.260]
Got a year to go man, a year, 53 weeks

[00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:20.740]
And he's gone, 53 weeks

[00:56:21.140 --> 00:56:23.100]
I'm not gonna say goodbye for a year, okay?

[00:56:23.260 --> 00:56:27.540]
In addition to which after the 53 weeks are over, I'll show up somewhere, maybe even on your pop-up toaster

[00:56:27.540 --> 00:56:28.400]
I'll be somewhere

[00:56:29.580 --> 00:56:32.340]
So what are they getting all like emotional and agusiva?

[00:56:32.480 --> 00:56:35.820]
I'm not looking for that, believe me and it's really ponderous listening

[00:56:35.820 --> 00:56:38.840]
I can't stand listening to what hear myself, can you stand it?

[00:56:39.100 --> 00:56:40.240]
Well they just love you so you know

[00:56:40.240 --> 00:56:42.040]
Again I didn't hear they love me

[00:56:42.500 --> 00:56:46.480]
I'm gonna happy how they agreed to you think I got into my space out of our 14th

[00:56:46.480 --> 00:56:49.280]
You know I don't want to like to upload that whole thing up

[00:56:49.280 --> 00:56:50.840]
I don't want to blow it up, but

[00:56:51.380 --> 00:56:54.000]
That thing to me and again being an old fart like I'm...

[00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:57.180]
What did I tell you a long time ago? It's for pedophiles and teenagers

[00:56:57.180 --> 00:56:58.340]
That's what that thing is for

[00:56:58.340 --> 00:56:59.440]
That's all it's for

[00:56:59.440 --> 00:57:01.660]
So it's great to follow it in either category

[00:57:01.660 --> 00:57:03.140]
It's mostly a waste of time

[00:57:03.140 --> 00:57:03.560]
What?

[00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:04.260]
Nothing

[00:57:04.260 --> 00:57:05.980]
Now I didn't know what you said because you cut out

[00:57:05.980 --> 00:57:07.780]
That's so great for you huh, just kidding around

[00:57:09.380 --> 00:57:10.900]
Well I'm sure I'm gonna miss you

[00:57:11.520 --> 00:57:11.900]
Oh

[00:57:11.900 --> 00:57:15.780]
You know how like when they cut a gigantic bowling ball sized tumor out of your pupic

[00:57:15.780 --> 00:57:17.760]
It's not a tumor really miss it

[00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:19.040]
Yeah, it's a tumor alright

[00:57:19.040 --> 00:57:21.680]
You're all gonna die out there and that's where Linda Blair said

[00:57:21.680 --> 00:57:23.540]
I guess I'm gonna have to watch that again today

[00:57:23.540 --> 00:57:25.860]
The Ephraises all of its woodline Wednesday

[00:57:26.360 --> 00:57:28.620]
Did I mention on here that I went to early yesterday morning

[00:57:28.620 --> 00:57:31.200]
I got up really early on Christmas day, there was nobody on the road

[00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:35.500]
I got in my Pontiac Solstice and I drove to woodline in 1,200 bucks and came home

[00:57:35.500 --> 00:57:36.960]
You're amazing early yesterday

[00:57:36.960 --> 00:57:37.460]
What?

[00:57:37.680 --> 00:57:38.940]
You were up way too early yesterday

[00:57:38.940 --> 00:57:41.120]
I got up a quarter to six in the morning man

[00:57:41.120 --> 00:57:42.620]
And to see what was under my tree

[00:57:42.620 --> 00:57:44.040]
What was in my stocking?

[00:57:44.340 --> 00:57:45.460]
What did they lead for you?

[00:57:45.820 --> 00:57:46.820]
W.A.M. Hello

[00:57:46.820 --> 00:57:49.340]
Neil these bulls, these American fools

[00:57:49.340 --> 00:57:50.920]
They've been read by the nose

[00:57:50.920 --> 00:57:52.520]
Wake up can't you see?

[00:57:52.760 --> 00:57:54.680]
I mean did you watch a documentary on PBS third day Neil?

[00:57:55.560 --> 00:57:56.980]
What are you talking about sir?

[00:57:57.240 --> 00:57:58.060]
The documentary on PBS third day

[00:57:58.060 --> 00:57:59.460]
You're just making sounds with your mouth?

[00:57:59.940 --> 00:58:02.240]
The same things you've been talking about over and over again

[00:58:02.240 --> 00:58:04.560]
They did documentary on PBS third day

[00:58:04.560 --> 00:58:06.600]
They just justified everything you've been reading

[00:58:06.600 --> 00:58:10.600]
About how I word note WMDs how it was all while I have things in that

[00:58:10.600 --> 00:58:12.440]
All these people are dead and nobody cares

[00:58:12.440 --> 00:58:15.540]
Don't you understand nobody cares and why doesn't anybody care

[00:58:15.540 --> 00:58:19.420]
Because the mass media they're telling all the things are going a lot much better

[00:58:19.420 --> 00:58:21.740]
And now thanks to the surge and everything's better

[00:58:21.740 --> 00:58:23.320]
And it's going to be great and blah blah blah

[00:58:23.320 --> 00:58:27.200]
And yeah, because the media leads the public around in America

[00:58:27.200 --> 00:58:30.060]
By the nose, by the nose

[00:58:30.640 --> 00:58:32.880]
Or sometimes by the ass

[00:58:33.540 --> 00:58:34.760]
That's what goes on in America

[00:58:34.760 --> 00:58:37.300]
They'll decide for you what's important and what's not important

[00:58:37.300 --> 00:58:38.860]
What you think you know I need to know

[00:58:38.860 --> 00:58:40.820]
And other than that don't go on the internet

[00:58:40.820 --> 00:58:42.620]
You might get some real news on there

[00:58:43.240 --> 00:58:44.640]
Like on our website for example

[00:58:44.640 --> 00:58:46.620]
I don't suddenly put up like seven stories last night

[00:58:46.620 --> 00:58:48.960]
But it was Christmas night you know right?

[00:58:49.460 --> 00:58:50.180]
That was kind of you

[00:58:50.180 --> 00:58:51.300]
I want to overwork her

[00:58:51.840 --> 00:58:52.420]
What's her name?

[00:58:52.720 --> 00:58:54.540]
Corpus, he's in New York this week right?

[00:58:54.800 --> 00:58:54.940]
Correct

[00:58:54.940 --> 00:58:56.280]
Well more power to him

[00:58:56.280 --> 00:58:57.620]
Today though I'm going to make up for it

[00:58:57.620 --> 00:58:58.960]
I'll put like 400 stories on there

[00:58:58.960 --> 00:59:01.620]
Just to make sure you're keeping your nose to the grindstone

[00:59:01.620 --> 00:59:03.260]
For that next check you think you're going to get

[00:59:03.980 --> 00:59:04.980]
Somebody QYM Hello

[00:59:04.980 --> 00:59:06.520]
What do you mean we'll follow?

[00:59:07.440 --> 00:59:08.420]
Somebody QYM Hello

[00:59:08.420 --> 00:59:10.940]
Got a year left Neil, you got to make a cow

[00:59:10.940 --> 00:59:13.620]
You got to get the wind behind your back and go on the brakes

[00:59:13.620 --> 00:59:15.260]
Show these cars that you're about

[00:59:18.960 --> 00:59:22.280]
Now wait now wish I could have heard what that sounded like on this end

[00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:23.980]
Because it cut out like three times

[00:59:23.980 --> 00:59:27.460]
No it just cut out three times and sort of like basically that

[00:59:27.460 --> 00:59:28.040]
That's cool

[00:59:28.040 --> 00:59:31.000]
I think the level is on these causes like way low

[00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:32.120]
Alright I'll push it up more

[00:59:32.560 --> 00:59:34.640]
Can you crank him up so maybe I can hear him a little bit

[00:59:34.640 --> 00:59:37.140]
Although quite frankly I'm not so sure that's a good idea

[00:59:37.140 --> 00:59:38.540]
It's cranked really up now

[00:59:38.540 --> 00:59:39.440]
Is it really?

[00:59:39.660 --> 00:59:42.320]
Oh yeah, cranking I think crank is the operative word yeah

[00:59:42.320 --> 00:59:43.980]
Somebody QYM Hello

[00:59:44.760 --> 00:59:45.160]
Yes

[00:59:45.560 --> 00:59:49.140]
I think we need to get the rackies get behind the rackies

[00:59:49.140 --> 00:59:50.720]
Yeah it's a bridge standard again

[00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:52.800]
It's a Reverend Jones again

[00:59:52.800 --> 00:59:54.900]
Reverend Jones for the 4 million time

[00:59:54.900 --> 00:59:56.840]
We need to get somebody to take him out

[00:59:57.860 --> 00:59:58.520]
WQYM Hello

[00:59:59.180 --> 01:00:00.840]
I'm going to say 12,500

[01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:02.980]
WQYM Hello

[01:00:02.980 --> 01:00:04.980]
Santa Claus is real and he takes medications

[01:00:05.460 --> 01:00:05.900]
Haha

[01:00:08.820 --> 01:00:09.260]
Oh

[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:10.440]
Woo

[01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:14.460]
Santa's coming to town with a fistful of pro-zac baby

[01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:17.300]
187 on the pole, what's our goal today like

[01:00:17.300 --> 01:00:18.820]
Fuck's what I'm that's right huh

[01:00:19.420 --> 01:00:20.980]
Fuck's 500 my ass, are you crazy?

[01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:21.600]

[01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:24.160]
Oh 200, yeah 200's a reasonable goal

[01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:25.660]
Because we change them in stream

[01:00:26.220 --> 01:00:27.620]
So what do we have on the first one?

[01:00:27.740 --> 01:00:28.560]
We had seven something?

[01:00:29.700 --> 01:00:31.200]
I'll find it maybe I should make it

[01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:34.180]
753, 753 on the previous one

[01:00:34.180 --> 01:00:35.720]
And we got 187 now

[01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:37.880]
So we could get a thousand all that I'll towed

[01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:39.340]
Right? We got 940?

[01:00:40.100 --> 01:00:42.000]
That's our goal is to get a thousand between the two

[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000]
And if we have to put another pole up there to get to a thousand

[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.160]
We'll do that, we'll do it anyway we need to do it

[01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:46.740]
We'll cheat

[01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:48.560]
Yank cheat me, yank turn

[01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:53.360]
My any worst in nation is US housing prices drop 6.7%

[01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:55.020]
Worse in nation

[01:00:55.020 --> 01:00:56.700]
Oh my god

[01:00:56.700 --> 01:00:59.620]
US home prices fell in October for the 10th consecutive month

[01:00:59.620 --> 01:01:01.980]
Posting their biggest month of the client since early 1991

[01:01:01.980 --> 01:01:04.680]
According to the standard and poor's home price index

[01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:09.720]
The record 6.7% drop mark the 23rd consecutive month of price deceleration

[01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:11.500]
No matter how you look at these data

[01:01:11.500 --> 01:01:13.960]
It's obvious that the current state of single family housing market

[01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:18.160]
Remains grim said Robert Schiller who helped create the index in the statement today

[01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:20.960]
The previous record of the client was at drop of 6.3%

[01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:22.380]
Recorded in April 91

[01:01:22.380 --> 01:01:26.420]
The S&P home price index tracks price of existing single family homes in 10

[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:28.800]
Metroponnerious compared with the year earlier

[01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:31.960]
A broader index of 20 metro areas fell 6.1%

[01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:34.380]
Among 20 metro palmneries used in the broader index

[01:01:34.380 --> 01:01:36.380]
11 posted record monthly declines

[01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:40.380]
Miami posted the largest decline among the 20 markets reviewed

[01:01:40.380 --> 01:01:40.960]
Oh my god

[01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:44.680]
Home prices in a Miami metro area fell 12.4% in October

[01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:49.740]
Compared with the same month last year surpassing Tampa as the worst performing city

[01:01:49.740 --> 01:01:52.660]
Tampa posted a year over your loss of 11.8%

[01:01:52.660 --> 01:01:59.180]
Beside those two cities Detroit, Las Vegas, Phoenix and San Diego also posted double the year over your declines

[01:01:59.180 --> 01:02:04.460]
Atlanta and Dallas which had been previously posted in price appreciation fell in October compared with the year earlier

[01:02:04.460 --> 01:02:07.720]
Prices fell 0.7% in Atlanta and 0.1% in Dallas

[01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:13.460]
Only three areas Charlotte, North Carolina, Portland and Seattle posted year over your home price appreciation in October

[01:02:13.460 --> 01:02:16.260]
With Charlotte posting largest gains at 4.3%

[01:02:16.260 --> 01:02:22.820]
All 20 cities in the broader index posted month over month declines with San Diego posting the largest decline at 2.6%

[01:02:22.820 --> 01:02:25.120]
In other words I go out and give me like a pup tent with me

[01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:26.740]
What biggest name?

[01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:29.180]
The best out of here is male projects

[01:02:29.180 --> 01:02:31.600]
4.560 QAM

[01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:33.500]
The fourth leader

[01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:37.200]
Anybody have a heart or a liver?

[01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:47.100]
Well done I miss was quite delightful

[01:02:47.100 --> 01:02:50.860]
But some folks thought his jokes were spiteful

[01:02:50.860 --> 01:02:54.080]
He got kicked off the radio

[01:02:54.860 --> 01:02:58.060]
He said ho, he said ho, he said ho

[01:02:58.060 --> 01:03:02.060]
And it seems his career was right now

[01:03:02.060 --> 01:03:05.760]
That's politically incorrect now

[01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:09.180]
And management said he had to go

[01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:12.780]
He said ho, he said ho, he said ho

[01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:16.460]
Maybe what he did wasn't right

[01:03:16.460 --> 01:03:20.280]
And it started to be a storm

[01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:23.900]
Even if you're old cranky and white

[01:03:25.080 --> 01:03:27.560]
Sometimes you've got to conform

[01:03:28.860 --> 01:03:31.620]
Times back on the air now

[01:03:31.620 --> 01:03:35.260]
But does anybody really care now?

[01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:35.580]
No

[01:03:35.580 --> 01:03:38.760]
The moral of the story you know

[01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:44.260]
Don't say ho, don't say ho, don't say ho

[01:03:45.900 --> 01:03:46.940]
No, no

[01:03:46.940 --> 01:03:49.500]
1133, look at that, Romney campaign cools

[01:03:49.500 --> 01:03:53.400]
Because everybody knows he's a phony and a liar and a BS artist and two faced and full of crap

[01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:56.400]
And he's wearing a magic underwear, they're really nervous about that

[01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:58.880]
204 votes on a poll about death

[01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:00.180]
I'm dying out of here

[01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:01.640]
WQAM, hello

[01:04:02.820 --> 01:04:03.260]
QAM

[01:04:04.220 --> 01:04:04.660]
Yes

[01:04:04.660 --> 01:04:06.760]
I eat some odys, I love your show

[01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:08.600]
Yeah, they're gone now

[01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:09.760]
You didn't die yet?

[01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:10.880]
Not yet

[01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:12.040]
You working on it?

[01:04:12.660 --> 01:04:16.680]
Work harder on it, okay, work real hard on it and see if you can't croak before the new year

[01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:18.900]
Do it in mankind a favor, okay

[01:04:18.900 --> 01:04:22.420]
Five cents towards what's it? That's the fake fly mic, what difference does it make?

[01:04:22.580 --> 01:04:23.780]
Does it make a difference? Same credit

[01:04:24.260 --> 01:04:27.860]
Five, six, seven, oh five, sixty, pound five, sixty and they've arrived in singular

[01:04:28.420 --> 01:04:31.740]
Lireless line, it's our post Christmas, it's our holiday special baby

[01:04:31.740 --> 01:04:34.820]
From now until, now what's gonna happen next week?

[01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:36.100]
Monday, we're here, right?

[01:04:36.260 --> 01:04:36.620]
Mm-hmm

[01:04:36.620 --> 01:04:38.680]
And then Tuesday, New Year's Day, we have no idea

[01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:39.300]
We are all

[01:04:39.300 --> 01:04:41.660]
Well, that's right, we won't be, oh you say we

[01:04:41.660 --> 01:04:42.920]
I'm off on the Tuesday

[01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:45.680]
Yeah, we would all get off already, I'm actually off too, so I'm very happy

[01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:47.060]
You got that official now?

[01:04:47.620 --> 01:04:50.400]
Well, I thought the unofficial schedule and they have a bowl game, so yeah

[01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:52.960]
Oh, we do have a bowl, we got a ball game bowl game?

[01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:57.100]
We got two bowl games, we got the holiday bowl on Thursday night and midnight

[01:04:57.100 --> 01:05:00.100]
And then on Friday we got the Emerald Bowl from eight to midnight

[01:05:00.100 --> 01:05:02.680]
Wow, the Emerald Bowl, what's all that's in?

[01:05:03.640 --> 01:05:05.020]
I think it's in San Francisco as well

[01:05:05.020 --> 01:05:07.760]
Let me kill some time, WDQAM, hello

[01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:08.640]
Hello, Neil

[01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:09.460]
Yes, sir

[01:05:09.460 --> 01:05:13.500]
You wanna make it look like an accident, suicide or you wanna cut an example?

[01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:18.440]
WDQAM, hello

[01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:20.240]
Happy New Year, healthy Hanukkah, Neil

[01:05:21.320 --> 01:05:23.300]
Happy Chinnukhide, it's long over though, yes

[01:05:23.300 --> 01:05:25.360]
Do you know, do we know anything about Kwanzo?

[01:05:25.460 --> 01:05:28.460]
We don't have to birth the Jesus, you know about the cute men who are from the oil

[01:05:28.460 --> 01:05:29.600]
What is Kwanzo about?

[01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:29.980]
Explain it

[01:05:29.980 --> 01:05:33.840]
Hi, we're gonna do any idea, I'll Google it though for you, I'm gonna do a thing I'm boxing to you here in a minute

[01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:37.060]
Alright, I appreciate that, and Neil, don't take any crap from anybody

[01:05:37.060 --> 01:05:40.900]
Okay, bye WDQAM, hello

[01:05:40.900 --> 01:05:42.080]
I saw Santa Claus

[01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:45.840]
Okay, great, that's it, Faisa, you know, he was amusing there once

[01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:50.480]
But once it gets to be the 8,000 time that it's not even slightly amusing anymore, you know what I mean?

[01:05:50.980 --> 01:05:53.300]
I definitely don't do it, WDQAM, hello

[01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:58.900]
I'm gonna do, let me mama, I'm still fantasizing about Barack Obama

[01:06:01.540 --> 01:06:02.380]
WDQAM, hello

[01:06:02.380 --> 01:06:03.800]
Oh, oh, yeah

[01:06:05.240 --> 01:06:06.380]
You can do it

[01:06:06.380 --> 01:06:11.840]
Oh, it's the Eater, it's his eating market, a Salami sandwich

[01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:21.240]
On toast, 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 under the horizon, singular wireless line, pretty disappointing after you led me to think we're gonna get a tremendous response here today

[01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:22.000]
I'm sorry

[01:06:22.500 --> 01:06:27.280]
Now what you said before the show, yeah, I'm like, they kept these phones pumping all four hours

[01:06:27.780 --> 01:06:30.740]
Well, they had them pumping, but they were getting the same two freaks

[01:06:30.740 --> 01:06:31.260]
Yeah

[01:06:31.900 --> 01:06:37.840]
We only got like eight or nine different ones, see, at least after all these years, at least they've gotten accumulated a greater number of creeps

[01:06:37.940 --> 01:06:40.620]
Well, that's good, but yeah, once they're on again, maybe tomorrow

[01:06:40.620 --> 01:06:42.680]
Maybe they'd like to come back and try it again tomorrow

[01:06:43.700 --> 01:06:44.400]
WDQAM, hello

[01:06:44.940 --> 01:06:46.000]
Oh, yes

[01:06:46.500 --> 01:06:47.560]
WDQAM, how you doing, Neil?

[01:06:47.900 --> 01:06:48.480]
Okay, sir

[01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:53.180]
So, do you hear your voice, Sad, you're leaving in the future, but always enjoyed your show

[01:06:53.180 --> 01:07:00.740]
One of those shameless requests, I just don't know if none of them are not, but the Black Tooth, something stopped

[01:07:00.740 --> 01:07:01.000]
What?

[01:07:01.880 --> 01:07:04.420]
Playing stop with Black Tooth, could you do that, Bill?

[01:07:04.840 --> 01:07:05.040]
No

[01:07:06.420 --> 01:07:07.120]
WDQAM, hello

[01:07:07.120 --> 01:07:08.140]
I'm responding

[01:07:08.140 --> 01:07:11.820]
It wasn't, it wasn't funny, 15 years ago, Duane stopped, wasn't funny

[01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:13.280]
WDQAM, hello

[01:07:14.360 --> 01:07:14.860]
It's Neil

[01:07:14.860 --> 01:07:15.740]
Yes, sir

[01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:19.100]
Neil, how were we gonna listen to you when you're gone?

[01:07:19.620 --> 01:07:20.980]
I don't know, how do I know now?

[01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:23.120]
I mean, how?

[01:07:23.260 --> 01:07:23.260]

[01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:26.360]
How would your ears, sir, do your ears work?

[01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:30.040]
With your ears, that's how you're gonna listen, okay, although in your case, I doubted

[01:07:30.420 --> 01:07:32.260]
How are we gonna listen to you when you're gone?

[01:07:32.980 --> 01:07:39.200]
That normal Kent, man, I just sent him an email, that trial, he just, you found, continues amazing and astounding

[01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:42.740]
And just creating a hysteria where he didn't need in the first place

[01:07:42.740 --> 01:07:43.940]
What, he said, what?

[01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:46.040]
That's in the email, but he didn't respond

[01:07:46.040 --> 01:07:48.260]
Oh, okay, he won't, no, he won't

[01:07:49.140 --> 01:07:49.940]
WDQAM, hello

[01:07:50.860 --> 01:07:51.720]
Neil, please

[01:07:52.260 --> 01:07:52.800]
Speaking, yes

[01:07:52.800 --> 01:08:00.540]
Oh, hey, Neil, I gotta wait a, I gotta wait a cure, the Dolphins quarterback problem that's plagued us for about 20 years

[01:08:00.540 --> 01:08:01.020]
Uh-huh

[01:08:01.580 --> 01:08:04.640]
How else is GOGIT, Jim Drunken Miller?

[01:08:05.960 --> 01:08:07.180]
Let me try to once I've failed

[01:08:09.740 --> 01:08:10.520]
WDQAM, hello

[01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:13.920]
It puts the quans, uh, WDQAM, hello

[01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:15.060]
Hey, Neil

[01:08:15.060 --> 01:08:15.920]
Yes, sir

[01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:21.340]
So how you get so bitter, is it the homosexuality, is it the frustration of the radio?

[01:08:21.860 --> 01:08:22.700]
It makes you so bitter

[01:08:22.700 --> 01:08:23.740]
Ditter about what?

[01:08:24.160 --> 01:08:24.660]
About light

[01:08:24.660 --> 01:08:27.600]
You know that bitter about life at all, my life's pretty damn good

[01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:34.040]
Oh, yeah, I think you talk to somebody that, I think it's hang up or people or cut them off or you've solved them

[01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:39.280]
If they have something to say, I listen, if they have nothing to say, then I don't listen, I cut them off, that's correct

[01:08:39.280 --> 01:08:40.720]
So, basically the whole thing

[01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:46.420]
So in other words, your idea of a talk show is just to punch up a button and let people spew crap, and then their idea of a talk show?

[01:08:46.780 --> 01:08:48.600]
No, that's not the idea, it's just right there

[01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:51.300]
So, what is cutting idiots off have to do with being bitter?

[01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:54.200]
You think it is a bitter person, Neil, you know you are

[01:08:54.200 --> 01:08:54.780]
Why?

[01:08:54.780 --> 01:08:57.380]
You know you are a bitter person, why not?

[01:08:57.760 --> 01:08:59.080]
You're bitter, but that's not a problem

[01:08:59.400 --> 01:09:02.120]
Let me ask you this question, let me ask you a question

[01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:04.080]
Let me ask you a question

[01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:06.980]
Yeah, you're so bitter, then how come you're listening?

[01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:08.960]
Because you're entertaining a little bit

[01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:11.960]
Oh, well good, there you go, I'm entertaining and I'm bitter, so what's wrong with that?

[01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:13.540]
That's what they're paying me for to be entertaining

[01:09:13.540 --> 01:09:17.280]
And to get you to listen, and obviously I'm accomplishing both, so nice job, Neil

[01:09:17.280 --> 01:09:18.100]
Oh God

[01:09:18.500 --> 01:09:18.820]
Wow

[01:09:18.820 --> 01:09:20.680]
Why are you so bitter, you're over?

[01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:24.720]
I used to get that years ago when I first started from the old parts, you're a bitter young man

[01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:26.720]
Now I'm a bitter old man, so it's how flutter

[01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:28.220]
So my number has changed

[01:09:28.220 --> 01:09:29.040]
That's right

[01:09:30.320 --> 01:09:31.700]
218 on the pool, what's our goal?

[01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:33.940]
Too funny I think

[01:09:34.980 --> 01:09:38.820]
Curtis for the man-dog, it's to the side, no Curtis has been in a lot of airtime and that's good, he's a good guy

[01:09:38.820 --> 01:09:40.800]
Now what did he talk about yesterday, him and the Beast?

[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:41.820]
They didn't talk about sports

[01:09:41.820 --> 01:09:43.360]
Thank God, thank you guys

[01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:44.980]
We'll talk about that website

[01:09:45.540 --> 01:09:46.960]
What website? The two girls

[01:09:47.400 --> 01:09:47.760]
Oh!

[01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:48.960]
Oh!

[01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:54.340]
Yeah, and then people were calling up saying other websites of similar nature

[01:09:55.540 --> 01:09:59.360]
We're talking about the differences between different holiday seasons

[01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:02.680]
And then just whatever they, you know, the differences between the seasons?

[01:10:02.760 --> 01:10:07.140]
No, you know, like between Christmas and Hanukkah and you know, celebrating it, not celebrating it

[01:10:07.140 --> 01:10:10.600]
You know, what does a Jew do on Christmas and stuff like that, so you know?

[01:10:11.060 --> 01:10:12.400]
Celebrations are stuff to go on

[01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:14.300]
What's the biggest name?

[01:10:14.580 --> 01:10:15.440]
The best talent

[01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:16.400]
You know, his male rejects

[01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:18.400]
4.560 QAM

[01:10:19.140 --> 01:10:19.680]
I think

[01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:20.920]
4th leader

[01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:23.380]
You're a bad

[01:10:27.860 --> 01:10:30.620]
You're a bad guy

[01:10:30.620 --> 01:10:31.620]
You're a bad guy

[01:10:33.820 --> 01:10:34.720]
You're a bad guy

[01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:37.560]
You're a bad guy

[01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:37.700]
You're a bad guy

[01:10:37.700 --> 01:10:37.820]
You're a bad guy

[01:10:37.820 --> 01:10:39.480]
You're a bad guy

[01:10:39.480 --> 01:10:40.320]
You're a bad guy

[01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:41.180]
You're a bad guy

[01:10:41.180 --> 01:10:41.840]
You're a bad guy

[01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:42.080]
You're a bad guy

[01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:46.020]
You're a bad guy

[01:10:46.020 --> 01:10:46.660]
You're a bad guy

[01:10:46.660 --> 01:10:51.960]
On the next Riftly's, believe it or not

[01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:54.780]
You gotta see it to believe it

[01:10:54.780 --> 01:11:00.260]
There may soon be another baby in Britney Spears' life for 16-year-old younger sister Jamie Lynn as pregnant

[01:11:00.260 --> 01:11:02.860]
Britney, your 16-year-old sister is pregnant

[01:11:02.860 --> 01:11:04.080]
Accidents happen

[01:11:04.080 --> 01:11:07.600]
And after parting, you know, you really don't think about what you're doing

[01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:11.480]
Britney, she's only 16. What age do they have sex and Louisiana?

[01:11:12.020 --> 01:11:12.880]
13 years old

[01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:13.260]
Hello

[01:11:13.260 --> 01:11:14.340]
Yes, kind of weird

[01:11:14.340 --> 01:11:16.380]
What was your family like growing up?

[01:11:16.540 --> 01:11:19.820]
We got that about this church, but my parents weren't too too strict

[01:11:19.820 --> 01:11:22.320]
And how was the relationship between you and your dad?

[01:11:22.500 --> 01:11:23.520]
I did it with my dad

[01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:25.200]
That's it, it was a lot in my drive

[01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:25.880]
What country?

[01:11:26.140 --> 01:11:28.400]
What is kind of a threat for a while

[01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:29.840]
I don't want to hear the specifics

[01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:31.120]
But there's like carnices

[01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:32.480]
Too much information

[01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:35.480]
Her mom was very upset at first, but now is supportive

[01:11:35.480 --> 01:11:39.420]
The release of her mother's book on parenting is being postponed

[01:11:39.420 --> 01:11:42.020]
Only on a Riftly's, believe it

[01:11:42.020 --> 01:11:45.300]
And why should anybody care? That's the most important thing

[01:11:45.300 --> 01:11:48.560]
Why should anybody give a crap about this trailer trans family?

[01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:49.820]
Do you care? No, no

[01:11:49.820 --> 01:11:50.960]
Do you like here? No

[01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:53.560]
So, Dave Johnson sent a happy holidays card

[01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:55.560]
Well, happy holidays, Dave

[01:11:55.560 --> 01:11:57.400]
Oh, Dave sends whenever he Christmas, every year

[01:11:57.400 --> 01:11:58.540]
Now, what's on it this year?

[01:11:58.740 --> 01:11:59.360]
Do you open it up yet?

[01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:03.120]
Yeah, it's him and another guy, I'm not sure who it is, and says, from our family to yours

[01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:05.040]
Pauli Walnickson, Davey Peacons

[01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:08.300]
Pauli Walnickson, from the Sipranos, right?

[01:12:08.620 --> 01:12:10.480]
I guess, I mean, I've really never seen this party before

[01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:14.060]
You do it right, I never watched it, I don't want to watch it, I don't want to see it, I don't want it

[01:12:14.860 --> 01:12:16.240]
228 votes on our death pool

[01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:17.220]
Rock solid

[01:12:17.220 --> 01:12:18.620]
I'm dying on the earth

[01:12:18.620 --> 01:12:22.700]
And anyway, today is Boxing Day, yesterday Christmas Day, even in Canada, all over the world

[01:12:24.540 --> 01:12:27.100]
I still can go with the fact you asked me that

[01:12:27.100 --> 01:12:28.960]
And we're debating that yesterday

[01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:31.260]
No, there was a Christmas Day in Canada too

[01:12:31.780 --> 01:12:33.220]
How about in Iceland?

[01:12:36.460 --> 01:12:42.240]
Anyway, Boxing Day is a public holiday celebrated in the UK, Canada, New Zealand and Australia

[01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:45.220]
And many other members of the Commonwealth of Nations on December 26th

[01:12:45.220 --> 01:12:49.480]
The day after Christmas Day are all turniply on the next week day after Christmas

[01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:54.240]
Boxing Day is a traditional celebration dating back to the medieval ages

[01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:59.620]
And consists of the practice of giving out gifts to employees, the poor or the people in a lower social class

[01:13:00.220 --> 01:13:05.220]
The name has numerous folk etymologies, the Oxford English Ditionary, it tributes into the Christmas box

[01:13:05.220 --> 01:13:09.480]
The verb box meaning to give Christmas a Christmas box

[01:13:10.100 --> 01:13:12.980]
Therefore, Boxing Day, got it? Sure

[01:13:12.980 --> 01:13:16.080]
Outside the Commonwealth, the day is still celebrated with just a different name

[01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:21.700]
The more common stories included was that when people would give a present or Christmas box to those who would work for them throughout the year

[01:13:21.700 --> 01:13:25.700]
In Fugal times, Christmas was a reason for gathering or extended families

[01:13:25.700 --> 01:13:32.860]
All the serfs would gather their families in the manner of their Lord, which made it easier for the Lord to be a state to hand out annual stipends to the serfs

[01:13:32.860 --> 01:13:35.680]
Kind of like you, Chris, you getting a stipend? No

[01:13:36.500 --> 01:13:44.100]
After all the Christmas parties on 26 December, Lord of the State would give practical routes such as cloth, grains and tools to the serfs who would have done his land

[01:13:44.100 --> 01:13:46.880]
Each family would get a box full of such goods a day after Christmas

[01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:50.140]
Under this explanation, there was nothing voluntary about this transaction

[01:13:50.140 --> 01:13:55.880]
The Lord of the Manor was obliged to supply these goods because of the boxes being given out today was called Boxing Day

[01:13:56.700 --> 01:14:03.440]
In England many years ago, it was common practice for the servants to give boxes to their employers when they arrive for their days work on the day after Christmas

[01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:06.720]
There were employers who then put coins into boxes as special energy or gifts

[01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:09.940]
This can be compared with the modern day concept of Christmas bonuses

[01:14:09.940 --> 01:14:13.480]
The servants carried boxes for the coins hence the name Boxing Day

[01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:17.820]
In churches it was traditional to open the church's donation box on Christmas day

[01:14:17.820 --> 01:14:21.800]
And the money in the donation box was to be distributed to the poor or lower-class citizens the next day

[01:14:21.800 --> 01:14:26.820]
In this case the boxing boxing day comes from that lock box in which the donations were left

[01:14:26.820 --> 01:14:30.440]
I wonder if Al Gore knew about that lock box, huh? I wonder if the priest knew about it

[01:14:30.840 --> 01:14:36.100]
For now, if you leave money in the lock box, it has to go to all those lawsuits about those pedophile priests

[01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:38.620]
Oh my God!

[01:14:38.780 --> 01:14:39.640]
Four of these things

[01:14:40.520 --> 01:14:44.840]
5,670,560,050,050,060 in the residence singular wireless line

[01:14:44.840 --> 01:14:47.540]
A lot of good calls today I thought, then you? No

[01:14:47.540 --> 01:14:50.060]
What do you mean by that? No? They've been okay

[01:14:50.060 --> 01:14:52.200]
Like I said, a couple of good calls today

[01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:53.780]
How many QAM? Hello

[01:14:54.540 --> 01:14:55.840]
Hello? Yes, sir

[01:14:56.580 --> 01:14:58.200]
Neil, I gotta tell you

[01:14:58.200 --> 01:15:01.460]
I live out in Las Vegas

[01:15:02.120 --> 01:15:06.240]
And about 20 years ago I remember you saying from about magic underwear

[01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:08.440]
I said, what the hell is he talking about?

[01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:12.420]
And I thought that we're a big LBS community out here in Vegas

[01:15:12.420 --> 01:15:14.240]
You're right, man

[01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:16.300]
Magic underwear all over the place

[01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:19.880]
The guys have to wear it, the ladies have to wear it

[01:15:19.880 --> 01:15:25.200]
Sometimes you can only bathe like half your body because your magic underwear has to stay on half

[01:15:25.900 --> 01:15:29.720]
And then you wear the magic underwear to go into gazing room

[01:15:29.720 --> 01:15:30.740]
Have you ever heard that?

[01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:33.100]
The walkroom? Gazing room

[01:15:33.100 --> 01:15:35.060]
There's some celestial room

[01:15:35.540 --> 01:15:37.920]
That you go in and you have this special robe

[01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:39.700]
And you have to have the magic underwear under it

[01:15:39.700 --> 01:15:40.820]
Oh my God

[01:15:40.820 --> 01:15:41.020]
Why?

[01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:44.000]
That's what you did in the middle

[01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:47.620]
After all these years I finally figured out what the hell you were talking about

[01:15:47.620 --> 01:15:49.560]
There you go, well you see something later

[01:15:49.560 --> 01:15:50.580]
Take her

[01:15:50.580 --> 01:15:52.100]
Okay, see you

[01:15:52.100 --> 01:15:53.640]
See you finally figured it out

[01:15:54.100 --> 01:15:55.960]
Well I bet you this is from a normal kid

[01:15:55.960 --> 01:15:57.320]
Yeah it is, it's kind of useless

[01:15:57.320 --> 01:16:01.200]
But then again, 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, 0, 5, 60

[01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:02.880]
And they've arrived in Singular wireless line

[01:16:03.540 --> 01:16:04.180]
WQAM, hello

[01:16:06.440 --> 01:16:07.060]
WQAM, hello

[01:16:07.060 --> 01:16:08.780]
Your heart is dirty

[01:16:09.200 --> 01:16:09.600]
Mad

[01:16:10.760 --> 01:16:11.320]
Mad, why?

[01:16:12.020 --> 01:16:13.900]
Mad, well, WQAM, hello

[01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:15.120]
Hi, Neil

[01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:16.020]
Yes sir

[01:16:16.600 --> 01:16:17.940]
I was calling to tell you

[01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:21.120]
Because of all the articles you always put on the internet

[01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:22.740]
And they always keep me up

[01:16:23.940 --> 01:16:25.260]
I'm having such a field

[01:16:25.260 --> 01:16:27.700]
They watch in the Republicans tear at each other

[01:16:27.700 --> 01:16:30.620]
With that madness that they have towards anybody else

[01:16:30.620 --> 01:16:32.440]
No, well thank God that Democrats aren't doing that

[01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:34.300]
No, I know, no, we all are

[01:16:34.300 --> 01:16:36.660]
But you know, they take it to that whole

[01:16:36.660 --> 01:16:38.420]
The whole near the endowl level

[01:16:38.420 --> 01:16:38.720]
You know?

[01:16:39.260 --> 01:16:43.720]
Well, we got to find out which one is the most serious Jesus Christ who that's what it's all about

[01:16:43.720 --> 01:16:44.920]
That's what the Republicans want

[01:16:44.920 --> 01:16:46.780]
I know, I know, well you have a great place

[01:16:46.780 --> 01:16:47.740]
On this case, it's the God

[01:16:49.660 --> 01:16:53.340]
And if you could hear what I'm hearing on these phones, I'm in with the dropouts

[01:16:53.340 --> 01:16:54.380]
I bet it's fun

[01:16:54.780 --> 01:16:57.360]
You'd say to yourself, why is he even doing this?

[01:16:57.540 --> 01:16:58.300]
That's a good question

[01:16:58.300 --> 01:16:59.000]
Because you're dedicated

[01:16:59.320 --> 01:16:59.980]
Because I'm one?

[01:17:00.620 --> 01:17:00.940]
Dedicated

[01:17:00.940 --> 01:17:02.140]
No, because I'm an idiot

[01:17:02.500 --> 01:17:03.080]
Well, that too

[01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:04.460]
And I should be playing music

[01:17:04.460 --> 01:17:05.780]
I mean, are they doing anything?

[01:17:05.780 --> 01:17:09.500]
I see what's happened traditionally when this happens and it came out of nowhere today

[01:17:09.500 --> 01:17:11.660]
Is that it goes on for a couple of hours

[01:17:11.660 --> 01:17:14.340]
And then all of a sudden it strains itself out and nobody does anything

[01:17:14.760 --> 01:17:16.100]
Well, I did tell a course though

[01:17:16.100 --> 01:17:17.560]
Where when you were telling me in that first break

[01:17:17.560 --> 01:17:20.140]
Yeah, but that haven't gone back over to asking me anything yet

[01:17:20.140 --> 01:17:20.780]
So I'll see what's up

[01:17:21.740 --> 01:17:22.860]
What's he going to tell you?

[01:17:22.920 --> 01:17:24.680]
That they're putting a call in, I don't know

[01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:26.060]
Putting a call into what?

[01:17:26.300 --> 01:17:27.440]
To Jesus?

[01:17:28.200 --> 01:17:30.540]
And then you're going to say, oh well, a reboot to thing there

[01:17:30.540 --> 01:17:32.420]
Turn off the atelos, we're going to go through that again

[01:17:32.420 --> 01:17:33.220]
You want to do that again?

[01:17:33.500 --> 01:17:35.020]
No, we thought that was the worst idea

[01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:38.880]
It's going to be the connection down the line, the internet and all that stuff

[01:17:38.880 --> 01:17:39.520]
It's not us or you

[01:17:39.520 --> 01:17:41.400]
It's something there, man, it's something there

[01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:43.700]
It's something in that place

[01:17:44.240 --> 01:17:45.340]
W-D-Q-A-M, hello

[01:17:45.920 --> 01:17:46.940]
Don't tell you, Steve Bro

[01:17:47.920 --> 01:17:49.080]
W-D-Q-A-M, hello

[01:17:49.080 --> 01:17:50.280]
Santa Claus is enormous

[01:17:50.680 --> 01:17:51.780]
Q-A-M, hola

[01:17:51.780 --> 01:17:54.380]
Q-A-M

[01:17:55.300 --> 01:17:57.400]
Hello, this is our initial line of looking to make

[01:17:57.400 --> 01:17:58.760]
W-D-Q-A-M, hello

[01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:01.140]
After a further review

[01:18:01.700 --> 01:18:04.140]
W-D-Q-A-M, the last call, hello

[01:18:04.140 --> 01:18:05.720]
You need to come down and straighten it out

[01:18:06.700 --> 01:18:07.520]
What is it?

[01:18:07.800 --> 01:18:09.920]
You need me to come down and straighten that out

[01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:11.780]
Oh, it's Reverend Jones again

[01:18:11.780 --> 01:18:15.440]
It's Reverend Jones, we need to come down and straighten your ass out

[01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:16.240]
You idiot

[01:18:17.240 --> 01:18:19.880]
No wonder Dick Feinberg kicked him out of Pompadot Park

[01:18:19.880 --> 01:18:22.480]
He's never been the same and then they kicked Dick out of Pompadot Park

[01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:25.960]
It must be nice to not have to worry about doing anything but crank calling people

[01:18:25.960 --> 01:18:26.860]
Worry about what?

[01:18:26.860 --> 01:18:27.440]
You cut out

[01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:30.980]
Said it must be nice to not have to worry about anything other than crank calling people

[01:18:30.980 --> 01:18:31.340]
Right

[01:18:31.340 --> 01:18:34.620]
And then they'll have to worry about doing like, you know, a real job and stuff like that

[01:18:34.620 --> 01:18:35.360]
Don't watch

[01:18:35.360 --> 01:18:36.440]
Here we go again

[01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:40.700]
Oh, I like the way he took the deeper

[01:18:41.840 --> 01:18:42.920]
You like that?

[01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:45.320]
That was good, I like the technique there

[01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:46.800]
Take a good deep breath and then

[01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:48.660]
I like that

[01:18:48.660 --> 01:18:52.200]
Because if you don't take the deep breath you can like emote quite as well

[01:18:52.200 --> 01:18:54.820]
Exactly, right? You want to breathe it from the diaphragm

[01:18:54.820 --> 01:18:55.520]
That's correct

[01:18:55.520 --> 01:19:00.020]
240 votes on the pole on death after I die expect to blank

[01:19:00.020 --> 01:19:02.080]
I honestly have no clue 110

[01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:04.500]
Become nothing more than worm food 55

[01:19:04.500 --> 01:19:06.280]

[01:19:06.280 --> 01:19:09.040]
Live on in an afterlife 26 ride

[01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:11.880]
Be reincarnated 9 and become a ghost 4

[01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:13.360]
Go step on an ant

[01:19:13.360 --> 01:19:16.060]
Go step on it and then like take your shoe and like

[01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:18.780]
Smooth it around on the cement

[01:19:18.780 --> 01:19:24.760]
Real heavy duty so that all the particles are every molecule just like separates you know what I mean

[01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:29.320]
Well sometimes you step on them and they kind of get in between your the treads and the two this shoe

[01:19:29.720 --> 01:19:33.100]
Maybe that was an ant god like looking out for me not killing them right away

[01:19:33.100 --> 01:19:34.460]
In other words, they're still alive

[01:19:34.880 --> 01:19:38.020]
Yeah, because like I don't know what type of shoes you wear but like you know you'll have like

[01:19:38.020 --> 01:19:44.940]
Like I was for a man. I wear ant killing shoes. Oh well maybe I slap on it. It's dead. It doesn't come back for seconds

[01:19:44.940 --> 01:19:49.200]
Okay, it doesn't like poke it said back out. I was like I don't think I want to go yet. It's dead

[01:24:17.340 --> 01:24:17.860]
エ

[01:24:47.340 --> 01:24:50.120]
and said it was crucial that nominations be vetted by the Senate.

[01:24:50.740 --> 01:24:53.600]
Presidential nominations for important positions within the executive branch

[01:24:53.600 --> 01:24:56.780]
should be carefully considered and debated before the Senate in order to ensure

[01:24:56.780 --> 01:24:59.240]
that the most qualified individuals are serving the American people

[01:24:59.240 --> 01:25:00.580]
were upset in a statement.

[01:25:01.260 --> 01:25:02.420]
And a partridge in a pair of trees.

[01:25:02.900 --> 01:25:05.440]
Those Democrats are really doing an arthing for America.

[01:25:05.720 --> 01:25:07.580]
How are they really showing a backbone?

[01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:08.140]
Not.

[01:25:08.660 --> 01:25:09.820]
You got two parties, man.

[01:25:09.920 --> 01:25:11.660]
You got evil dark and evil light.

[01:25:12.060 --> 01:25:12.620]
Take your pick.

[01:25:13.660 --> 01:25:14.720]
$259 on your pool.

[01:25:14.840 --> 01:25:16.260]
I have no idea where we are in that thing.

[01:25:16.260 --> 01:25:18.160]
You know that when you start a new one in the midstream like that.

[01:25:18.740 --> 01:25:19.980]
As if it makes a difference.

[01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:21.680]
You think it makes a difference?

[01:25:22.100 --> 01:25:22.360]
Of course.

[01:25:23.420 --> 01:25:27.980]
A newly declassified document shows that Jay Edgar Hoover, the long-time director

[01:25:27.980 --> 01:25:32.240]
of the FBI, had a plan to suspend habeas corpus and in prison some 12,000 Americans

[01:25:32.240 --> 01:25:33.680]
he suspected of disloyalty.

[01:25:34.120 --> 01:25:37.960]
Hoover said his plan to the White House on July 7, 1950, 12 days after the

[01:25:37.960 --> 01:25:41.640]
Korean War began, an invasion putting suspect Americans in military prisons.

[01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:45.380]
Hoover wanted prison, Harry S. Truman, to proclaim the mass arrest necessary

[01:25:45.380 --> 01:25:49.080]
to protect the country against treason, espionage, and sabotage.

[01:25:49.320 --> 01:25:52.960]
The FBI would apprehend all individuals potentially dangerous to national security

[01:25:52.960 --> 01:25:54.320]
Hoover's proposal be seen.

[01:25:54.800 --> 01:25:57.480]
The arrest would be carried out under a master-worn attention list and

[01:25:57.480 --> 01:25:58.620]
names provided by the Bureau.

[01:25:59.020 --> 01:26:01.800]
The names were part of an index that Hoover had been compiling for years.

[01:26:02.360 --> 01:26:06.120]
The index now contains approximately 12,000 individuals, which approximately

[01:26:06.120 --> 01:26:08.360]
97% are citizens of the U.S. he wrote.

[01:26:08.940 --> 01:26:12.580]
In order to make these, make effective these apprehensions, the proclamation

[01:26:13.020 --> 01:26:16.180]
suspends the red of habeas corpus, it said, or sounds like what we're going through

[01:26:16.180 --> 01:26:16.420]
now.

[01:26:17.140 --> 01:26:20.540]
habeas corpus, the right to seek relief from illegal detention, has been a fundamental

[01:26:20.540 --> 01:26:22.340]
principle of law for seven centuries.

[01:26:22.960 --> 01:26:25.720]
The Bush administration's decision to hold suspects for years at Guantana

[01:26:25.720 --> 01:26:30.140]
Moubae, has made habeas corpus a contentious issue for Congress and the Supreme Court

[01:26:30.140 --> 01:26:30.480]
today.

[01:26:31.180 --> 01:26:34.760]
The Constitution says habeas corpus shall not be suspended unless one incases a

[01:26:34.760 --> 01:26:35.580]
verbatim or invasion.

[01:26:35.940 --> 01:26:37.380]
The public safety may require it.

[01:26:37.660 --> 01:26:41.420]
The plan proposed by G. Edgar Hoover, the head of the FBI from 1924 to 72,

[01:26:41.940 --> 01:26:45.500]
stretched that clause to include threatened invasion or attack upon U.S. troops

[01:26:45.500 --> 01:26:47.120]
in legally occupied territory.

[01:26:48.040 --> 01:26:51.100]
Hoover's plan was declansive by last Friday as part of a collection of Cold War

[01:26:51.100 --> 01:26:54.400]
documents concerning intelligence issues from 1950 to 55.

[01:26:54.840 --> 01:26:57.440]
The collection makes up a new volume of the formulations of the United States.

[01:26:57.740 --> 01:27:01.000]
A series that by law has been published continuously by the State Department since

[01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:01.720]
the Civil War.

[01:27:02.340 --> 01:27:06.100]
Hoover's plan called for the permanent detention of the roughly 12,000 suspect

[01:27:06.100 --> 01:27:08.400]
in military bases, as well as in federal prisons.

[01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:12.480]
The FBI, he said, had found the arrested, proposed in New York and California, would

[01:27:12.480 --> 01:27:13.940]
cross the prisons there to overflow.

[01:27:14.500 --> 01:27:18.360]
So the bureau had arranged for detention military facilities of the individuals apprehended

[01:27:18.360 --> 01:27:19.340]
in those states he wrote.

[01:27:20.080 --> 01:27:24.220]
A fascist, a Nazi, a self-hating fag if ever there was one, gay,

[01:27:24.520 --> 01:27:25.640]
D. Edgar Hoover.

[01:27:26.620 --> 01:27:30.320]
And I'm sure he'll look into his people to say, oh, he was a wonderful defender of justice

[01:27:30.320 --> 01:27:32.320]
and the leader of the FBI for a million years.

[01:27:32.700 --> 01:27:34.200]
And right, was Zarr.

[01:27:34.480 --> 01:27:36.060]
He used to dress up though pretty good at the parties.

[01:27:36.200 --> 01:27:36.940]
He liked to dress up.

[01:27:37.420 --> 01:27:38.540]
Good book, by the way.

[01:27:38.800 --> 01:27:40.480]
We're trying to forget the name, but the gay,

[01:27:40.580 --> 01:27:42.080]
Hoover's stir after what the name was.

[01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:43.980]
Nobody reads anymore anyhow, do they?

[01:27:44.740 --> 01:27:44.960]
I do.

[01:27:45.420 --> 01:27:46.700]
They just watch videos from you.

[01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:47.160]
Shoo!

[01:27:47.720 --> 01:27:48.460]
What are you reading?

[01:27:49.040 --> 01:27:50.540]
I'll actually, uh, Clive Custler.

[01:27:50.840 --> 01:27:51.260]
Comic books?

[01:27:51.560 --> 01:27:51.780]
No.

[01:27:52.460 --> 01:27:53.200]
You read what?

[01:27:53.860 --> 01:27:54.620]
Clive Custler.

[01:27:54.960 --> 01:27:55.640]
I read your pardon.

[01:27:56.180 --> 01:27:56.380]
Uh-huh.

[01:27:56.820 --> 01:27:57.620]
Was that second word?

[01:27:58.020 --> 01:27:58.380]
Custler?

[01:27:58.600 --> 01:27:58.840]
Yes.

[01:27:59.300 --> 01:27:59.800]
And who's that?

[01:28:00.280 --> 01:28:04.920]
He's a writer, does kind of like, you know, action books, I guess you can kind of say,

[01:28:05.020 --> 01:28:05.380]
you know what I mean?

[01:28:05.380 --> 01:28:08.560]
I guess, I guess if you're reading this stuff, he must be a writer, figures, you know.

[01:28:09.260 --> 01:28:10.000]
Yeah, and you're right to watch.

[01:28:10.180 --> 01:28:10.440]
Fiction?

[01:28:10.860 --> 01:28:11.000]
Yeah.

[01:28:11.560 --> 01:28:12.180]
You're wasting time.

[01:28:12.480 --> 01:28:13.320]
You're saying you're time reading fiction?

[01:28:13.660 --> 01:28:16.980]
Let me reach over by the way and turn off that screen, as I see every now and then, some

[01:28:16.980 --> 01:28:17.400]
lines, Brian.

[01:28:17.740 --> 01:28:17.900]
Okay.

[01:28:18.320 --> 01:28:19.920]
And you know me being weak like I am.

[01:28:20.480 --> 01:28:22.980]
Did you see the other movies, Sahara that had Matthew McConaughey in it?

[01:28:23.300 --> 01:28:23.760]
A couple years ago.

[01:28:24.140 --> 01:28:24.240]
No.

[01:28:24.500 --> 01:28:25.840]
Well, I was one of his, what movie was that?

[01:28:26.380 --> 01:28:26.700]
Sahara.

[01:28:27.340 --> 01:28:28.280]
Never heard about it.

[01:28:28.380 --> 01:28:28.780]
I've never seen it.

[01:28:28.980 --> 01:28:29.720]
Oh, well, it's pretty good.

[01:28:30.080 --> 01:28:31.540]
Were there a bunch of, uh, get skis in it?

[01:28:31.560 --> 01:28:32.840]
Were in like, schmottes on their head?

[01:28:32.840 --> 01:28:33.400]
Uh, no.

[01:28:33.840 --> 01:28:34.160]
No.

[01:28:34.500 --> 01:28:37.360]
How could it have been about the Sahara if there weren't a bunch of Arabs in it?

[01:28:37.520 --> 01:28:39.880]
Because they were going to the Sahara to try to find something.

[01:28:40.320 --> 01:28:40.940]
Try to find what?

[01:28:41.440 --> 01:28:47.760]
Try to find an artifactor, um, oh, they're trying to find a Civil War gold over the Sahara.

[01:28:48.500 --> 01:28:49.540]
Civil War gold?

[01:28:49.780 --> 01:28:49.940]
Yeah.

[01:28:50.580 --> 01:28:51.580]
You'd have to read the booker.

[01:28:51.920 --> 01:28:52.340]
See the movie?

[01:28:52.420 --> 01:28:53.700]
And how did it give in the Sahara?

[01:28:54.140 --> 01:28:56.180]
Well, that was the whole big part of it that, you know.

[01:28:56.240 --> 01:28:57.640]
Did Abraham Lincoln take it there?

[01:28:57.940 --> 01:28:58.360]
Yeah, maybe.

[01:28:58.800 --> 01:28:59.060]
Why?

[01:28:59.520 --> 01:29:00.160]
Ethan did, maybe.

[01:29:00.160 --> 01:29:02.700]
Well, this explains a lot about you, you know, the what you're reading.

[01:29:02.720 --> 01:29:02.880]
Uh-huh.

[01:29:03.260 --> 01:29:06.160]
It tells me a lot about the state of your mind.

[01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:07.420]
Well, what do you, what do you, what do you, what do you, what do you, what do you, what

[01:29:07.420 --> 01:29:09.560]
do you, what do you, what do you, what do you, what do you, what do you, what do you, what

[01:29:52.360 --> 01:29:52.360]

[01:29:52.360 --> 01:29:52.360]

[01:29:52.360 --> 01:29:52.360]

do you, what do you, what do you, what do you, what do you, what do you, what do you, what

do you, what do you, what do you, what do you, what do you, what do you, what do you, what

[01:30:24.780 --> 01:30:24.780]

[01:30:24.780 --> 01:30:24.820]
do you, what do you, what do you, what do you, what do you, what do you, what do you, what

[01:30:24.820 --> 01:30:28.220]
do you, what do you, what do you, what do you, what do you, what do you, what do you, what do you,

[01:30:39.220 --> 01:30:45.460]
what do you, what do you, what do you, what do you, what do you, what do you, what do you, what

[01:30:45.460 --> 01:30:45.540]
do you, what do you, what do you, what do you, what do you, what do you, what do you, what do you, what

[01:30:45.540 --> 01:30:45.540]

do you, what do you, what do you, what do you, what do you, what do you, what do you, what do you, what

[01:32:28.260 --> 01:32:33.140]
do you, biggest name, the best, apo, voila, spew various notes, what do you, radius one,

[01:32:33.140 --> 01:32:50.240]
the device is clever, this one is bigger, this two monthหน squared.

[01:32:54.100 --> 01:32:57.700]
.Account, this one is elegant and lifetime, is the best, this is the best, this is the best jumping

[01:32:57.700 --> 01:33:04.460]
be there, a bit to rot those. Will he still be coming out of the

[01:33:04.460 --> 01:33:09.740]
parent in the dines, or live with more plays, since at the same time, will he be

[01:33:09.740 --> 01:33:17.620]
thinner, or still be fat? Or will he adopt a cat? I don't think he'll want to move

[01:33:17.620 --> 01:33:20.900]
back to Florida, when new 69.

[01:33:42.760 --> 01:33:46.220]
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord,

[01:33:46.220 --> 01:33:46.220]

[01:33:46.220 --> 01:33:46.240]
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord,

[01:33:46.240 --> 01:33:46.900]
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord,

[01:33:46.900 --> 01:33:49.900]
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord,

[01:33:59.620 --> 01:34:15.640]
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord,

[01:34:15.640 --> 01:34:17.980]
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord,

[01:34:17.980 --> 01:34:19.540]
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord,

[01:34:19.540 --> 01:34:19.540]

[01:34:19.540 --> 01:34:23.400]
oh, thee, oh, he may receive thunder,

[01:34:23.480 --> 01:34:27.120]
hath hidden north from st안�ndra,

[01:34:27.120 --> 01:34:42.980]
hath hidden pace of when do ye know and on from weiskt

[01:34:42.980 --> 01:34:44.640]
at 5.60 W.D.C.Y.M.

[01:34:44.740 --> 01:34:46.700]
Getting back to this, this is a good article here.

[01:34:47.420 --> 01:34:49.620]
Leonard Pitts wrote it, exhibit traces comic industries,

[01:34:50.080 --> 01:34:52.540]
Jewish origins, maybe out of colic-well-Smith Chris.

[01:34:52.860 --> 01:34:53.020]
Okay.

[01:34:53.540 --> 01:34:55.200]
And tell him that if it wouldn't have been for Hitler,

[01:34:55.360 --> 01:34:57.040]
we wouldn't have had all those comic books super heroes.

[01:34:57.520 --> 01:34:58.220]
All right, going on right now.

[01:34:58.760 --> 01:35:00.860]
It goes on to say, given what we know now of the Holocaust,

[01:35:01.080 --> 01:35:02.640]
there is a certain unbearable innocence

[01:35:02.640 --> 01:35:04.000]
to the exact wish fulfillment.

[01:35:04.360 --> 01:35:06.860]
These images of men in tights winning the war single handed.

[01:35:07.300 --> 01:35:09.740]
It's hard to believe anyone, writers, artists, readers,

[01:35:09.920 --> 01:35:11.000]
America was ever that young.

[01:35:11.320 --> 01:35:12.500]
But then these aren't history books.

[01:35:12.500 --> 01:35:13.460]
They're comic books.

[01:35:13.640 --> 01:35:14.860]
They're every of boys and young men,

[01:35:15.100 --> 01:35:16.220]
who've read in letters and newspapers

[01:35:16.220 --> 01:35:17.540]
about the terrible fate of the Jews,

[01:35:17.980 --> 01:35:19.100]
and have no means of fighting back

[01:35:19.100 --> 01:35:21.800]
except with pen and ink, and daydreams of fighting back.

[01:35:22.480 --> 01:35:24.880]
Kind of like Norma Kent, daydreams of fighting back.

[01:35:25.480 --> 01:35:27.600]
Which is the superhero mythos in a nutshell.

[01:35:28.040 --> 01:35:30.400]
What mile-banded reporter or spindly guy at the beach

[01:35:30.400 --> 01:35:31.880]
brushing sand out of his eyes

[01:35:31.880 --> 01:35:33.220]
hasn't nursed a dream of getting even.

[01:35:33.660 --> 01:35:35.660]
As Danny Finger-Roth, author of Describes

[01:35:35.660 --> 01:35:38.320]
is Clark Kent, Jews comics in the creation of superhero,

[01:35:38.760 --> 01:35:39.100]
puts it,

[01:35:39.460 --> 01:35:41.660]
the superhero fantasies come from the thing of,

[01:35:41.660 --> 01:35:43.500]
I'll show them if only they knew.

[01:35:43.900 --> 01:35:45.640]
Yeah, holy, if only they knew.

[01:35:46.340 --> 01:35:47.500]
Then it goes to an ethnic thing

[01:35:47.500 --> 01:35:48.640]
of we're sick of being afraid.

[01:35:49.240 --> 01:35:50.540]
And it's hard to imagine those years

[01:35:50.540 --> 01:35:51.780]
that anyone was more afraid

[01:35:51.780 --> 01:35:53.380]
or had more reason to be afraid than a Jew.

[01:35:54.320 --> 01:35:55.680]
Still, according to Jerry Robinson,

[01:35:55.980 --> 01:35:57.820]
who assembled Zapp and created Batman's sidekick,

[01:35:58.000 --> 01:35:59.700]
Robin and his nemesis to Joker,

[01:36:00.160 --> 01:36:01.940]
the fact that so many Jews ended up

[01:36:01.940 --> 01:36:03.560]
in the business of comic books is largely,

[01:36:03.780 --> 01:36:04.640]
Hampton Stance.

[01:36:04.980 --> 01:36:06.920]
Hampton Stance rhymes with Robin's pants,

[01:36:07.400 --> 01:36:08.420]
those green tights.

[01:36:08.720 --> 01:36:10.460]
The place was New York, the time was the 30s,

[01:36:10.460 --> 01:36:11.560]
there was a pool of talent in New York

[01:36:11.560 --> 01:36:12.440]
among first and second,

[01:36:12.820 --> 01:36:14.060]
third generation Jewish creators.

[01:36:14.060 --> 01:36:16.320]
There was a lot of anti-semitism at the time he says.

[01:36:16.840 --> 01:36:19.360]
Comic books became a professional ghetto of sorts for Jews

[01:36:19.360 --> 01:36:21.040]
when Superman ignited the comics,

[01:36:21.220 --> 01:36:23.560]
phrase publishers raced to get it on before peaked.

[01:36:23.960 --> 01:36:24.900]
There was no thought along,

[01:36:25.060 --> 01:36:25.380]
Joe, any more,

[01:36:25.440 --> 01:36:27.900]
so anything they produced by one day be deemed fit for museums,

[01:36:28.560 --> 01:36:29.920]
comic books were considered the ultimate

[01:36:29.920 --> 01:36:31.000]
and disposable entertainment.

[01:36:31.420 --> 01:36:32.020]
And as such,

[01:36:32.020 --> 01:36:33.500]
fairly disreputable,

[01:36:33.820 --> 01:36:35.200]
that men in the mindset of the day

[01:36:35.200 --> 01:36:36.860]
was not a feel from which anyone would bother

[01:36:36.860 --> 01:36:38.060]
disfricting Jews.

[01:36:38.440 --> 01:36:39.540]
You ever buy comic books?

[01:36:40.240 --> 01:36:40.840]
Yeah, of course.

[01:36:41.240 --> 01:36:42.460]
90 more, but I used to.

[01:36:42.740 --> 01:36:44.000]
I don't mean like last week,

[01:36:44.200 --> 01:36:45.060]
yeah, I haven't done it.

[01:36:45.120 --> 01:36:46.060]
I've bought a comic book in a couple of years.

[01:36:46.620 --> 01:36:47.160]
Couple of years?

[01:36:47.860 --> 01:36:48.800]
Yeah, probably at least five, six years.

[01:36:49.200 --> 01:36:50.380]
Now you're talking about collectibles

[01:36:50.380 --> 01:36:51.440]
or actually to read them?

[01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:53.080]
Um, a little bit of both, I guess.

[01:36:53.520 --> 01:36:55.140]
Uh, see when I was a kid,

[01:36:55.240 --> 01:36:56.940]
nobody bought stuff like that as collectibles

[01:36:56.940 --> 01:36:58.100]
because like the story just said,

[01:36:58.400 --> 01:37:00.520]
nobody thought this crap would be worth anything someday.

[01:37:00.760 --> 01:37:02.280]
Just like the boxes and boxes,

[01:37:02.600 --> 01:37:04.620]
there's two boxes full of baseball cards

[01:37:04.620 --> 01:37:07.140]
I had in the pristine commission that mothed you out

[01:37:07.140 --> 01:37:08.640]
because she thought it was a bunch of crap.

[01:37:08.960 --> 01:37:10.400]
See if you kept them, you could've been rich by that.

[01:37:10.740 --> 01:37:10.920]
Bitch.

[01:37:11.560 --> 01:37:12.700]
So a lot of Jewish kids,

[01:37:12.900 --> 01:37:14.360]
handy with pen and ink, good with words,

[01:37:14.960 --> 01:37:16.260]
tumbled into the newborn art form

[01:37:16.260 --> 01:37:17.000]
or as a young medium,

[01:37:17.100 --> 01:37:18.240]
Robinson said it was exciting

[01:37:18.240 --> 01:37:19.660]
like the early days of the movie industry.

[01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:21.680]
Everything we did, we did for the first time.

[01:37:22.420 --> 01:37:23.220]
The new medium however,

[01:37:23.400 --> 01:37:24.680]
didn't allow them unrestricted freedom

[01:37:24.680 --> 01:37:26.100]
the mantra for immigrants of that era.

[01:37:26.280 --> 01:37:28.480]
And none more so than Jews was to blend in

[01:37:28.480 --> 01:37:30.260]
to avoid calling attention to customs

[01:37:30.260 --> 01:37:31.620]
or cultural artifacts,

[01:37:31.840 --> 01:37:33.080]
the mainstream might think strange.

[01:37:33.700 --> 01:37:35.080]
So there were no comic book stories

[01:37:35.080 --> 01:37:36.760]
going directly out of the Jewish experience

[01:37:36.760 --> 01:37:38.760]
indeed the very word Jewish was seldom

[01:37:38.760 --> 01:37:39.900]
if ever used.

[01:37:40.480 --> 01:37:43.060]
Finger off a Jewish comic book editor puts it like this.

[01:37:43.400 --> 01:37:44.820]
What they were least about is profaning

[01:37:44.820 --> 01:37:45.800]
their ethnic identity.

[01:37:46.140 --> 01:37:47.460]
I think their closest to Keen was

[01:37:47.460 --> 01:37:48.620]
indirectly confronting Hitler,

[01:37:48.980 --> 01:37:49.500]
and if not directly,

[01:37:49.660 --> 01:37:50.620]
they didn't directly advocating

[01:37:50.620 --> 01:37:52.140]
for American participation in the war.

[01:37:52.840 --> 01:37:53.480]
Aside from that,

[01:37:53.580 --> 01:37:55.260]
I think the whole plot was to make a monthly series

[01:37:55.260 --> 01:37:57.040]
of comics, they were all about being American,

[01:37:57.160 --> 01:37:58.740]
not being any one racial or ethnic group.

[01:37:59.020 --> 01:37:59.960]
See back when I was a kid,

[01:38:00.040 --> 01:38:00.960]
I know a hundred years ago,

[01:38:01.080 --> 01:38:01.400]
and it's like,

[01:38:01.400 --> 01:38:02.780]
oh, there he goes with that old funny,

[01:38:02.900 --> 01:38:03.300]
dirty stuff,

[01:38:03.680 --> 01:38:04.960]
but used out Saturday morning,

[01:38:05.080 --> 01:38:05.580]
go to the movies

[01:38:05.580 --> 01:38:07.120]
and they had like serials.

[01:38:07.460 --> 01:38:09.080]
I'm not talking about like cereal in a box

[01:38:09.080 --> 01:38:10.380]
like frosted flakes.

[01:38:10.580 --> 01:38:12.080]
Oh, it's like talking to marries, right?

[01:38:12.620 --> 01:38:12.620]

[01:38:13.080 --> 01:38:14.740]
Like a rocket man,

[01:38:15.160 --> 01:38:16.640]
and that isn't what he was called rocket man.

[01:38:16.740 --> 01:38:17.220]
What was he called?

[01:38:17.660 --> 01:38:18.400]
Yeah, I don't know, yeah.

[01:38:18.460 --> 01:38:19.500]
I'm gonna have to Google it now.

[01:38:20.080 --> 01:38:20.540]
Yeah, I can't,

[01:38:20.620 --> 01:38:21.460]
and they show those,

[01:38:21.560 --> 01:38:22.420]
there's some channel here

[01:38:22.420 --> 01:38:23.640]
that they show those every now and then.

[01:38:24.580 --> 01:38:25.940]
Superman was like the same thing.

[01:38:26.060 --> 01:38:28.460]
There were like 15 minute serials every week,

[01:38:28.660 --> 01:38:30.400]
and it would leave you hanging at the end of the thing,

[01:38:30.660 --> 01:38:32.580]
and even westerns were like that with serials.

[01:38:33.200 --> 01:38:34.180]
Today, it's finger off.

[01:38:34.180 --> 01:38:35.000]
It's taken for granted

[01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:36.040]
that people are proclaiming

[01:38:36.040 --> 01:38:37.640]
and be proud of their ethnic heritage and background,

[01:38:37.800 --> 01:38:38.320]
but back then,

[01:38:38.640 --> 01:38:40.340]
whatever was the cause you leave the old country,

[01:38:40.520 --> 01:38:42.940]
you wanted to get as far away from that as possible.

[01:38:43.100 --> 01:38:43.920]
Kinda like South Florida.

[01:38:44.280 --> 01:38:46.260]
You want to get as far away from that as possible.

[01:38:46.820 --> 01:38:48.640]
And yet his finger off our use persuasively

[01:38:48.640 --> 01:38:49.040]
in his book,

[01:38:49.180 --> 01:38:50.920]
those cultural imperatives had a way of surfacing

[01:38:50.920 --> 01:38:53.040]
despite all conscious efforts in suppression.

[01:38:53.440 --> 01:38:55.020]
It wasn't just all the Hitler bashing stories

[01:38:55.020 --> 01:38:56.340]
at late 30s and early 40s,

[01:38:56.620 --> 01:38:57.560]
including most famously,

[01:38:57.680 --> 01:38:59.220]
the Joe Simon's Drung of Captain America

[01:38:59.220 --> 01:39:00.360]
decking the German leader.

[01:39:00.860 --> 01:39:02.600]
After all, you had to be Jewish-tayed Hitler.

[01:39:03.080 --> 01:39:04.100]
That's what Will Smith says.

[01:39:04.100 --> 01:39:06.600]
Know the Jewish roots also showed in some of the ways,

[01:39:06.800 --> 01:39:09.260]
considering the founding myth of the whole comics industry,

[01:39:09.580 --> 01:39:10.800]
Superman sent by his parents

[01:39:10.800 --> 01:39:11.900]
to escape the dying planet,

[01:39:11.900 --> 01:39:12.420]
Cricton.

[01:39:12.860 --> 01:39:14.680]
What is that but a riff on the story of Moses?

[01:39:15.200 --> 01:39:17.180]
Ah, Moishi, remember Moishi?

[01:39:17.740 --> 01:39:18.020]
Uh, no.

[01:39:18.440 --> 01:39:20.100]
Consider what Moishi and Solomon,

[01:39:20.300 --> 01:39:21.980]
maybe an Abraham Solomon, my grandpa.

[01:39:22.820 --> 01:39:24.720]
Consider Captain America turning up alive

[01:39:24.720 --> 01:39:26.340]
and still young decades after the war,

[01:39:26.500 --> 01:39:28.300]
steeped in regret over young ally who died.

[01:39:28.640 --> 01:39:30.540]
What is this but a Holocaust survivor's guilt?

[01:39:31.020 --> 01:39:32.480]
Consider the God of Thunder Thor,

[01:39:32.660 --> 01:39:33.480]
forbidden by his father,

[01:39:33.480 --> 01:39:34.440]
Odin, D'Ameria, human.

[01:39:34.800 --> 01:39:36.200]
Odin finally finds for him his finger,

[01:39:36.260 --> 01:39:37.080]
I've put it a nice,

[01:39:37.600 --> 01:39:39.740]
as guardian girl, they got a sif.

[01:39:40.500 --> 01:39:42.020]
Why sure, hope she didn't have sif.

[01:39:42.500 --> 01:39:44.620]
What is that but Jewish strictures against in a marriage?

[01:39:45.300 --> 01:39:47.180]
At least some of them indicated those stories are skeptical

[01:39:47.180 --> 01:39:48.040]
of this act of the fact,

[01:39:48.160 --> 01:39:50.420]
notion that they subconsciously buried artifacts

[01:39:50.420 --> 01:39:51.560]
of Jewish culture in their work,

[01:39:51.700 --> 01:39:52.200]
since Stanley.

[01:39:52.640 --> 01:39:54.300]
In my case, in the case of the people I knew,

[01:39:54.380 --> 01:39:55.600]
we were just trying to come up with heroes

[01:39:55.600 --> 01:39:57.120]
that people would be interested in.

[01:39:57.460 --> 01:39:58.320]
When there was the war in Europe,

[01:39:58.380 --> 01:39:59.220]
we always needed villains.

[01:39:59.360 --> 01:40:01.040]
We used Hitler and the Nazis as villains.

[01:40:01.320 --> 01:40:02.760]
When the communists were considered enemies,

[01:40:02.760 --> 01:40:04.020]
we had a lot of communists as villains.

[01:40:04.560 --> 01:40:06.100]
Today there were a lot of terrorists as villains.

[01:40:06.460 --> 01:40:07.880]
I don't know how much religion had to do with that.

[01:40:09.260 --> 01:40:12.540]
I used to buy my comics at Louis Susman's Dimes store

[01:40:13.620 --> 01:40:16.540]
in Rochester, New York on Conkey Avenue.

[01:40:17.040 --> 01:40:18.380]
She wants to part of time years ago,

[01:40:18.460 --> 01:40:19.540]
I would mention that and people were calling,

[01:40:19.800 --> 01:40:20.800]
oh I remember Louis Susman,

[01:40:20.800 --> 01:40:22.140]
he's been dead for 80 years though, Neil,

[01:40:22.200 --> 01:40:23.600]
but nevertheless, not anymore.

[01:40:24.020 --> 01:40:24.960]
Well, that's because those people ain't out dead.

[01:40:25.320 --> 01:40:27.020]
Those people are dead, that's right, they're all dead.

[01:40:27.380 --> 01:40:27.780]
Good point.

[01:40:28.480 --> 01:40:29.260]
Like the song says.

[01:40:29.540 --> 01:40:29.840]
Like what?

[01:40:30.120 --> 01:40:30.860]
Like the song says.

[01:40:31.300 --> 01:40:31.980]
What song is that?

[01:40:31.980 --> 01:40:32.940]
Dead, dead, dead.

[01:40:33.380 --> 01:40:34.960]
Oh, maybe I could play that for that guy.

[01:40:35.600 --> 01:40:38.440]
Again, almost 70 years after Superman's debut,

[01:40:38.740 --> 01:40:40.240]
Jewishness is no longer cohort.

[01:40:40.420 --> 01:40:42.480]
For instance, the X-Men comic book has borrowed

[01:40:42.480 --> 01:40:43.860]
liberally from Jewish experience,

[01:40:44.040 --> 01:40:45.820]
also the gay and African American experiences

[01:40:45.820 --> 01:40:48.960]
in spinning its allegorical Taylor prejudice against mutants,

[01:40:49.200 --> 01:40:51.000]
including a famous alternate future story

[01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.220]
that finally had mutants since the concentration camps.

[01:40:53.620 --> 01:40:55.660]
Superman is ventured back in time to save the Jews

[01:40:55.660 --> 01:40:57.520]
of the Warsaw ghetto back in the 80s,

[01:40:57.680 --> 01:40:59.120]
kept an American had a Jewish girlfriend,

[01:40:59.120 --> 01:41:01.380]
a number of heroes, Moon Knight, Shadow Cat,

[01:41:01.560 --> 01:41:03.860]
Colossal Boy, Sabra, the Israeli superhero team

[01:41:03.860 --> 01:41:06.520]
of Hayoth and most primarily, fantastic four strong

[01:41:06.520 --> 01:41:08.580]
and the thing are known to be Jewish.

[01:41:09.120 --> 01:41:10.200]
Well, I've seen a Jewish thing.

[01:41:10.820 --> 01:41:12.960]
Art speakin' in when a Pulitzer Prize in 1992

[01:41:12.960 --> 01:41:15.840]
for his graphic novel Maus, a serring Holocaust

[01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:18.540]
period in 2001, Michael Shaball,

[01:41:18.700 --> 01:41:19.600]
won the Pulitzer for the novel,

[01:41:19.740 --> 01:41:21.420]
the amazing adventures of Cavalier and Clay,

[01:41:21.820 --> 01:41:23.160]
is loving homage to the Jewish creators

[01:41:23.160 --> 01:41:24.080]
of the comics industry.

[01:41:24.540 --> 01:41:26.280]
It's enough of a turnaround that Captain American

[01:41:26.280 --> 01:41:28.060]
created Josiah Menn, responded to a request

[01:41:28.060 --> 01:41:30.360]
for comment on Zat, shoots back an email demanding

[01:41:30.360 --> 01:41:31.920]
to know what's with the sudden interest in Jews

[01:41:31.920 --> 01:41:33.820]
and comics he seems to be bemused.

[01:41:34.160 --> 01:41:35.060]
He has a right to be.

[01:41:35.620 --> 01:41:36.820]
Simon's more than nine decades,

[01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.400]
Virginia, where Jewishness was a vaguely shameful thing

[01:41:39.400 --> 01:41:41.120]
you kept to yourself to wonder the subject

[01:41:41.120 --> 01:41:42.180]
of his amusing exhibitions.

[01:41:42.820 --> 01:41:45.020]
A kid can dream, yes, Bacuda, who could have dreamt of this?

[01:41:45.460 --> 01:41:47.880]
Most of the kids are gone now, Jerry Siegel died in 96,

[01:41:48.320 --> 01:41:51.480]
Joe Schuster in 92, Bob Kane in 98, Jack Kirby in 94.

[01:41:51.840 --> 01:41:53.420]
I bet you'd do what Kirby still did too.

[01:41:53.840 --> 01:41:55.560]
But the daydreams they'd dreamt live on,

[01:41:55.560 --> 01:41:57.120]
all our guys would have been overwhelmed

[01:41:57.120 --> 01:41:57.960]
with seeing this happen,

[01:41:58.080 --> 01:42:00.380]
so Simon personally agreed that our little Jewish boys

[01:42:00.380 --> 01:42:01.040]
and other co-workers,

[01:42:01.040 --> 01:42:02.180]
richly deserve the credit

[01:42:02.180 --> 01:42:03.980]
that is being stolen upon in the day.

[01:42:04.120 --> 01:42:05.800]
Thank you all and Zagazone.

[01:42:06.640 --> 01:42:07.600]
The biggest name.

[01:42:07.860 --> 01:42:10.100]
The best talent is no objects.

[01:42:11.880 --> 01:42:12.400]
456QAM.

[01:42:12.640 --> 01:42:14.220]
The fourth leader.

[01:42:15.740 --> 01:42:18.520]
This is the most disgusting program.

[01:42:19.100 --> 01:42:22.040]
I urge everyone to complain to this station.

[01:42:23.920 --> 01:42:26.520]
I couldn't be wrong, but I could just drop out to be stopping.

[01:42:27.920 --> 01:42:28.240]
Why?

[01:42:28.640 --> 01:42:29.660]
To what drink so much?

[01:42:30.020 --> 01:42:30.060]
Why?

[01:42:30.440 --> 01:42:31.420]
Will I drink so much?

[01:42:31.540 --> 01:42:33.520]
Let me just stop it for a second and speak to me.

[01:42:33.660 --> 01:42:34.640]
Okay, let's see if this really happens.

[01:42:34.660 --> 01:42:35.360]
I'll go on. How's it going?

[01:42:35.460 --> 01:42:36.500]
Is it any better? Is it getting any better?

[01:42:39.140 --> 01:42:40.160]
No drop out there.

[01:42:40.500 --> 01:42:40.920]
Well, that's cool.

[01:42:41.340 --> 01:42:42.020]
Except the one talking.

[01:42:42.880 --> 01:42:44.420]
Every new year, you can't resist it.

[01:42:44.500 --> 01:42:45.760]
It's just when the ball comes down.

[01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:47.400]
I'll be on the ground, hugging the toilet.

[01:42:47.900 --> 01:42:49.960]
I can't believe my lips not the Z's

[01:42:49.960 --> 01:42:51.200]
and I can't smell A.A.

[01:42:51.200 --> 01:42:52.420]
Don't like sobriety.

[01:42:52.580 --> 01:42:54.020]
End of the year means a vendor.

[01:42:54.300 --> 01:42:55.000]
Find out bartender.

[01:42:55.200 --> 01:42:55.880]
Trincinna Bender.

[01:42:56.140 --> 01:42:57.300]
Who through years doesn't end up?

[01:42:58.160 --> 01:42:58.880]
I'll blow chunks.

You live in the armpit of America

[01:45:34.280 --> 01:45:37.760]
with a wife and a young daughter.

[01:45:39.160 --> 01:45:39.420]
Yeah.

[01:45:39.940 --> 01:45:41.240]
So is that girl turned 18?

[01:45:41.240 --> 01:45:42.000]
I'm outta here.

[01:45:44.460 --> 01:45:45.340]
Oh clear.

[01:45:45.340 --> 01:45:45.340]

[01:45:45.340 --> 01:45:46.580]
OK, we'll keep in touch lanterns.

[01:45:46.640 --> 01:45:47.300]
That was I was here in Columbia.

[01:45:47.300 --> 01:45:48.340]
I'll call again.

[01:45:48.740 --> 01:45:50.000]
Okay, take care of yourself.

[01:45:50.120 --> 01:45:50.380]
You're good.

[01:45:50.780 --> 01:45:55.780]
There's an acquaintance from Kalamazoo Michigan, baby, from Zen in years ago, 1968, 1969.

[01:45:56.200 --> 01:45:56.640]
Well, that's cool.

[01:45:57.060 --> 01:45:57.940]
Yeah, it is cool.

[01:45:58.140 --> 01:45:58.540]
Good guy.

[01:45:59.460 --> 01:46:01.260]
310 votes on a poll by the way, and then that.

[01:46:01.360 --> 01:46:03.640]
Now, see, I told you, and then there were no dropouts there.

[01:46:04.620 --> 01:46:05.580]
You didn't even see the poll, though.

[01:46:05.780 --> 01:46:08.540]
How annoying it is, how impossible it is to try to talk to people.

[01:46:08.760 --> 01:46:09.220]
Oh, right.

[01:46:09.800 --> 01:46:12.220]
And sometimes the dropout goes on for like three seconds.

[01:46:12.960 --> 01:46:14.120]
Well, just hearing me say...

[01:46:14.120 --> 01:46:16.660]
Just hearing when you play it back, I couldn't imagine having here that the whole time.

[01:46:16.660 --> 01:46:20.760]
Now, that wasn't one of the really bad ones either I tried, but that was one of the better ones.

[01:46:20.760 --> 01:46:22.140]
We're just dropping out intimately.

[01:46:22.900 --> 01:46:23.820]
Now, it was a shocker.

[01:46:23.860 --> 01:46:25.440]
Now I can reach over and shut the phone off.

[01:46:25.480 --> 01:46:26.140]
That was good, see?

[01:46:26.620 --> 01:46:26.900]
Oh, right.

[01:46:27.080 --> 01:46:30.400]
When I punch it up and it's Ricky Tickier, something like that that you want to talk to, you know?

[01:46:31.860 --> 01:46:32.780]
Well, that was good.

[01:46:33.080 --> 01:46:34.100]
That made my whole holiday.

[01:46:35.220 --> 01:46:35.940]
Aren't you proud?

[01:46:36.200 --> 01:46:36.460]
Fair to me.

[01:46:36.800 --> 01:46:36.800]

[01:46:36.960 --> 01:46:38.000]
And the dropouts are stopped.

[01:46:38.140 --> 01:46:38.620]
Let's hear it.

[01:46:39.960 --> 01:46:44.240]
Maybe Norma Kent will stop grandstanding long enough to let me continue enjoying the next of the year

[01:46:44.240 --> 01:46:46.660]
and collect my paychecks and just continue doing my job.

[01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:48.860]
And stop trying to create the crises, man.

[01:46:49.180 --> 01:46:50.180]
That's what you do best, Norma.

[01:46:50.240 --> 01:46:51.020]
You take like a little...

[01:46:51.020 --> 01:46:55.880]
You know how there might be like a little piece of paper on fire, on a desk somewhere.

[01:46:56.360 --> 01:47:02.840]
And somebody comes in and pours kerosene all over it and starts a gigantic humongous, un-extinguishable fire.

[01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:03.280]
You know what I mean?

[01:47:03.360 --> 01:47:03.980]
That's Norma Kent.

[01:47:04.180 --> 01:47:04.900]
You mean that's not a good thing?

[01:47:05.340 --> 01:47:09.200]
Taking a little problem and turning into a major crisis, blowing it up.

[01:47:09.800 --> 01:47:10.960]
Just calm down, Norma.

[01:47:11.080 --> 01:47:12.900]
Okay, go find some more runaways and calm down.

[01:47:12.900 --> 01:47:13.500]
Leave me alone.

[01:47:13.840 --> 01:47:14.080]
God.

[01:47:14.740 --> 01:47:16.820]
Go work on 2009, okay?

[01:47:18.380 --> 01:47:20.600]
And a guy that called me four who wondered why I'm bitter.

[01:47:22.400 --> 01:47:23.660]
We don't have enough time.

[01:47:23.760 --> 01:47:25.040]
It's only a four hour show, sir.

[01:47:25.220 --> 01:47:27.280]
I'm not really bitter, but I'm just... I'm bitter.

[01:47:28.100 --> 01:47:30.540]
You know the spots that Donald Sutherland does for Signe Healthcare?

[01:47:30.740 --> 01:47:31.320]
Where's his Signe?

[01:47:31.540 --> 01:47:31.780]
Signe?

[01:47:32.100 --> 01:47:32.500]
Not really.

[01:47:32.940 --> 01:47:33.840]
You never seen those on TV?

[01:47:34.080 --> 01:47:34.440]
My God.

[01:47:34.540 --> 01:47:35.820]
What is wrong with you?

[01:47:36.160 --> 01:47:37.480]
I guess I'm watching the wrong thing, man.

[01:47:37.740 --> 01:47:37.820]
What?

[01:47:38.140 --> 01:47:39.120]
I guess I'm watching the wrong things.

[01:47:39.640 --> 01:47:41.800]
Signe, Signe Healthcare, he speaks with a speechy thing.

[01:47:41.800 --> 01:47:42.740]
Like Donald Sutherland.

[01:47:42.900 --> 01:47:43.980]
Like some kind of a fruitcake.

[01:47:44.020 --> 01:47:44.500]
You're fairy.

[01:47:45.240 --> 01:47:48.900]
Signe Healthcare is taking heed this Christmas, but isn't backing down after its decision

[01:47:48.900 --> 01:47:52.900]
and I, a liver transplant to a teenager, afflicted with leukemia left her dead.

[01:47:53.320 --> 01:47:53.960]
You see that story?

[01:47:54.400 --> 01:47:54.900]
I did not.

[01:47:55.280 --> 01:47:56.060]
Well, she's dead.

[01:47:56.540 --> 01:47:57.920]
Whether you saw her or not, she's still dead.

[01:47:58.360 --> 01:48:01.280]
Natalie Sarchissian, 17, died last week.

[01:48:01.460 --> 01:48:05.920]
And you notice how Lance, my good friend from Kalamazoo, was just talking like... sounded like George there.

[01:48:06.420 --> 01:48:08.640]
After the kids get old enough to move out of the house, I'm out of here.

[01:48:08.860 --> 01:48:09.580]
Yeah, I thought of that too.

[01:48:09.580 --> 01:48:14.120]
Yeah, I hear an awful lot of that from all these amery guys, all these heteros.

[01:48:14.280 --> 01:48:15.160]
Well, that's what goes.

[01:48:16.340 --> 01:48:20.680]
Natalie Sarchissian, 17, died last week after several complications following a bone marrow transplant.

[01:48:21.040 --> 01:48:22.860]
Signe had refused to cover a liver transplant.

[01:48:23.020 --> 01:48:27.420]
The girls doctors had requested, dubbing it experimental, only to be considered at the last minute

[01:48:27.420 --> 01:48:29.700]
when the girls parents already decided to take her off life support.

[01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:31.120]
Oh, it changed their mind too late.

[01:48:31.300 --> 01:48:31.740]
She's dead.

[01:48:32.200 --> 01:48:32.980]
She's on the verge.

[01:48:33.220 --> 01:48:34.300]
She's dying over here.

[01:48:34.420 --> 01:48:35.620]
I'm dying over here.

[01:48:35.620 --> 01:48:39.320]
After taking a beating in the press and on the web, the Philadelphia-based insurance giant

[01:48:39.320 --> 01:48:41.720]
distributed the letter to the press money, defending their decision.

[01:48:42.220 --> 01:48:47.120]
In a letter co-written by Signe President David Cardani, and chief medical officer Dr. Jeffrey Kang,

[01:48:47.660 --> 01:48:51.200]
the company said they doubted the efficacy of the transplant procedure in Sarchissian's case.

[01:48:51.660 --> 01:48:55.440]
In this case, rather than going through our standard method of appeal, we went directly to not one,

[01:48:55.680 --> 01:48:59.080]
but two independent experts in the field who agreed that the procedure in question,

[01:48:59.200 --> 01:49:02.900]
given the patient's particular circumsizes, would not have been an effective or appropriate treatment.

[01:49:02.900 --> 01:49:08.120]
They wrote, evaluating her case on evidence-based guidelines published by independent physician and medical organizations

[01:49:08.120 --> 01:49:12.400]
as well as expert scientific journals and a partridge in a fair tree, but a weak but a boot put about.

[01:49:13.200 --> 01:49:16.920]
Sarchissian's family say they will slowly insure a good, I hope they get a zillion dollars, man.

[01:49:17.380 --> 01:49:21.400]
They alleged to the twice-ticker rock transplant list and purposely waited until she was near death

[01:49:21.400 --> 01:49:26.860]
to approve the transplant because the firm didn't want to bear the cost of the procedure or rehabilitation following the operation.

[01:49:26.860 --> 01:49:32.980]
According to the memo, distributed into the press, the insurer approves more than 90% of all liver transplants requested by its subscribers.

[01:49:33.760 --> 01:49:39.340]
UCLA doctors put around the list for liver transplant December 6th, and liver became available four days later the family said

[01:49:39.340 --> 01:49:45.960]
according to the LA Times, her doctors told Signe the letter that patients in similar situations had a 65% chance of living six months

[01:49:45.960 --> 01:49:50.560]
if they received the liver transplant. Signe refused the procedure however, dubbing it experimental.

[01:49:50.980 --> 01:49:55.440]
Last Thursday, they reversed the decision allowing the transplant to move forward, even though they considered experiment

[01:49:55.440 --> 01:50:01.020]
outside the scope of her mother's policy by the time the news reached Sarchissian's family, however, the girl was already dead.

[01:50:01.440 --> 01:50:05.220]
Too late, she's dead. Oh, but can't you do something about that? We are now too late.

[01:50:05.860 --> 01:50:09.460]
Her parents opted to take her off life support earlier that day, seeing no hope or recovery.

[01:50:09.820 --> 01:50:16.560]
In the letter of Signe officers said they wouldn't comment on the family-specific charges, saying only some of the accusations had mischaracterized our decisions and intentions.

[01:50:16.720 --> 01:50:20.840]
We had good intentions, but she's dead. Yeah, thickened my ass.

[01:50:21.600 --> 01:50:26.560]
No wonder Donald Sutherland Litzfoyne said, Thigna. There was a guy named John Signe who used to be on air.

[01:50:26.660 --> 01:50:31.880]
I think he was at the KDK. I'm not really sure. Does that name ring a bell? And who was Rocketman? No idea.

[01:50:32.580 --> 01:50:34.520]
Let me, can I google it right now? Yeah, of course, can.

[01:50:35.400 --> 01:50:41.180]
Rocketman, no idea. That's why I called him. Oh, command, a commando Cody. That was his name. Just don't know me.

[01:50:41.180 --> 01:50:48.780]
Have you ever heard him? No. They run the whole thing here every now and now. One of my old emoldy TV channels. Oh, it's great. Rocketman, that's not it.

[01:50:49.100 --> 01:50:53.540]
But commando Cody, I'll do that during the break. I don't want to do all this stuff on here because it's bad radio.

[01:50:53.680 --> 01:50:57.500]
And so last thing we want to do, baby, on this station is do any bad radio.

[01:50:58.240 --> 01:51:04.080]
The biggest name of the best know you can ever want. 60 km.

[01:51:04.440 --> 01:51:06.020]
The sports leader.

[01:51:07.460 --> 01:51:09.240]
Or David's a bitch.

[01:51:09.360 --> 01:51:14.940]
Roger, what's the problem up there? Roger Houston confirmed we lost our nuts and bolts up here.

[01:51:15.920 --> 01:51:18.880]
Roger, that you guys know what you're doing up there.

[01:51:20.100 --> 01:51:23.200]
Well, to be honest, we didn't use to negative on that.

[01:51:23.680 --> 01:51:27.540]
They lost a vote last night in flight.

[01:51:28.940 --> 01:51:31.120]
I'm for crying out loud.

[01:51:31.120 --> 01:51:33.700]
I'm for the same, because bad is bad.

[01:51:34.060 --> 01:51:35.440]
Houston, we have a problem.

[01:51:35.600 --> 01:51:37.220]
And that's all I have to say about that.

[01:51:37.620 --> 01:51:39.420]
I'm as opposed to be high.

[01:51:41.780 --> 01:51:42.800]
Okay, I'm joining in here.

[01:51:44.260 --> 01:51:45.000]
I'm dying yet.

[01:51:45.160 --> 01:51:48.320]
Think you might be able to send someone up here to help us?

[01:51:48.980 --> 01:51:51.240]
Roger, space station, negative on that.

[01:51:51.640 --> 01:51:55.560]
I've never heard such don't stuff in my life.

[01:51:56.100 --> 01:51:59.080]
This is not funny. It's totally unprofessional.

[01:51:59.080 --> 01:52:01.640]
It's not simple to space.

[01:52:02.260 --> 01:52:05.180]
You already. You're a fat idiot.

[01:52:05.900 --> 01:52:10.340]
Such an expensive life.

[01:52:11.420 --> 01:52:13.060]
Space station, I'm not sure.

[01:52:13.320 --> 01:52:15.680]
Technically what you want us to do down here.

[01:52:16.700 --> 01:52:19.020]
Well, Houston, we're not exactly sure what to do up here.

[01:52:19.560 --> 01:52:22.680]
I think it's gonna be a long, long time.

[01:52:22.680 --> 01:52:26.320]
I'll say space is well, untouched on.

[01:52:26.580 --> 01:52:29.700]
While I'll send to my panic, I'll bring them home.

[01:52:29.940 --> 01:52:31.740]
Oh, no, no, no.

[01:52:32.500 --> 01:52:33.800]
There's a rocket man.

[01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:36.300]
By a very professional.

[01:52:36.620 --> 01:52:40.860]
Rocket man, shoot with a permission way up there.

[01:52:41.480 --> 01:52:42.300]
Warning, warning.

[01:52:42.600 --> 01:52:44.260]
Come on, this is a rocket science here.

[01:52:44.380 --> 01:52:45.760]
Thank you fellow astronauts there.

[01:52:46.100 --> 01:52:47.600]
I think what you're doing is really important.

[01:52:48.060 --> 01:52:49.440]
Thanks for taking my phone call.

[01:52:49.440 --> 01:52:50.860]
Now get back to work.

[01:52:51.120 --> 01:52:51.820]
Thank you.

[01:52:52.840 --> 01:52:54.560]
Yeah, thanks for taking my call.

[01:52:54.880 --> 01:52:55.720]
Where have we heard that before?

[01:52:55.900 --> 01:52:57.260]
Too many times, 1245.

[01:52:57.720 --> 01:53:00.280]
And it's all of a sudden, like since the dropout stuff,

[01:53:00.460 --> 01:53:01.700]
like the whole world is open up now.

[01:53:01.880 --> 01:53:02.140]
I don't know.

[01:53:02.440 --> 01:53:02.840]
What's cool?

[01:53:03.320 --> 01:53:04.300]
You know what I mean?

[01:53:04.600 --> 01:53:04.980]
What do you mean?

[01:53:05.080 --> 01:53:07.080]
I felt like I was doing the show like in a broom closet.

[01:53:07.220 --> 01:53:08.680]
I've been out of the closet too many years for that.

[01:53:09.140 --> 01:53:09.920]
Like Commando Cody.

[01:53:10.620 --> 01:53:11.640]
And speak of that.

[01:53:12.240 --> 01:53:13.100]
So I googled it.

[01:53:13.260 --> 01:53:14.960]
And I'd do you ever come across interesting article

[01:53:14.960 --> 01:53:17.360]
something you know, and there's no name on it?

[01:53:17.360 --> 01:53:17.940]
Mm-hmm.

[01:53:18.460 --> 01:53:19.380]
There's a long thing here.

[01:53:19.540 --> 01:53:22.960]
It's, as my childhood hero, a brief overview of the Commando Cody,

[01:53:23.120 --> 01:53:24.640]
aka Rocket Man character.

[01:53:24.880 --> 01:53:25.840]
And it's really interesting.

[01:53:25.940 --> 01:53:27.540]
And it's even got a couple of pictures on it.

[01:53:27.760 --> 01:53:29.160]
But it doesn't have a name on it.

[01:53:29.240 --> 01:53:29.820]
Not that I care.

[01:53:29.940 --> 01:53:31.320]
It would be somebody we don't know anyway, right?

[01:53:31.740 --> 01:53:32.820]
It's a bit of a shmendrick.

[01:53:33.380 --> 01:53:35.300]
He says, one Saturday morning in the late 50s,

[01:53:35.300 --> 01:53:37.220]
I stumbled out of a show quite by accident

[01:53:37.220 --> 01:53:38.540]
that caught my attention and imagination.

[01:53:39.080 --> 01:53:41.220]
It was Commando Cody, Scott Marshall of the Universe.

[01:53:41.740 --> 01:53:43.580]
Commando Cody was a hero designated by the

[01:53:43.580 --> 01:53:46.700]
Interplanatory Council to thwart the plans of aliens

[01:53:46.700 --> 01:53:48.620]
from outer space and taking over the earth.

[01:53:48.880 --> 01:53:50.520]
To me, Cody was exciting and special.

[01:53:50.760 --> 01:53:52.680]
He possessed equipment that provided the means for me

[01:53:52.680 --> 01:53:53.960]
to do things that other heroes could not,

[01:53:54.220 --> 01:53:59.300]
when the exception of Superman, he couldn't do what Superman could do.

[01:53:59.860 --> 01:54:01.460]
I'm just distracted, one moment please.

[01:54:01.940 --> 01:54:04.520]
He had an aerodynamic metallic bullet-shaped helmet

[01:54:04.520 --> 01:54:06.420]
and a flight suit with a jetpack strapped to his back

[01:54:06.420 --> 01:54:08.640]
that enabled him to fly and travel to other plants

[01:54:08.640 --> 01:54:10.960]
in the solar system before the aliens fiendish plants.

[01:54:11.340 --> 01:54:15.540]
And when you saw it, if you thought Clark Kent was like kind of a goofy looking guy,

[01:54:15.540 --> 01:54:18.280]
you know, when he took the Superman outfit off in the game and audio,

[01:54:18.700 --> 01:54:20.680]
this guy was like a schmerell.

[01:54:21.020 --> 01:54:21.360]
Oh, what?

[01:54:21.880 --> 01:54:23.200]
It's just a putz.

[01:54:23.540 --> 01:54:25.460]
I'm trying to think of somebody in the building

[01:54:25.460 --> 01:54:28.360]
who might look like Bob Eisenberg like that, you know,

[01:54:28.640 --> 01:54:29.740]
with a mustache. Gotcha.

[01:54:30.240 --> 01:54:31.880]
Like Maddie Bell on Stilts.

[01:54:32.640 --> 01:54:36.160]
He also had a bullet-shaped rocket ship that could travel to other plants.

[01:54:36.800 --> 01:54:40.960]
He also wore a uniform with a black mask like the lone ranger.

[01:54:41.280 --> 01:54:43.560]
However, I do recall seeing some episodes where he didn't wear the mask

[01:54:43.560 --> 01:54:44.860]
which confused me to some degree.

[01:54:45.220 --> 01:54:48.560]
He had this crazy helmet he would put on in this outfit that he would...

[01:54:48.560 --> 01:54:50.140]
I was... were crazy.

[01:54:50.540 --> 01:54:53.880]
Cheesy. It was very cheesy, but then again, you'd have to consider how long ago it was.

[01:54:54.380 --> 01:54:57.960]
Since being so young at the time, I can't recollect how many of the 12 episodes I actually saw,

[01:54:58.220 --> 01:55:01.060]
but it was one of my main objectives every Saturday morning, not to miss this show.

[01:55:01.520 --> 01:55:05.120]
I drew numerous pictures of Cody and his deeds when we kids played outside,

[01:55:05.260 --> 01:55:08.840]
some kids played Sky King, some were Jason Jackson,

[01:55:09.180 --> 01:55:10.180]
but I was commanding Cody.

[01:55:10.780 --> 01:55:15.820]
Nevertheless, Cody and his flight suit were only on television for a brief time when he no longer appeared in Saturday mornings.

[01:55:16.220 --> 01:55:19.600]
I would wait patiently for more of his adventures, but Commando Cody never returned,

[01:55:20.040 --> 01:55:23.540]
as I grew older Commando Cody became a blurred memory to me.

[01:55:24.080 --> 01:55:27.980]
But, some 30 or so odd years passed from the time I was a young child.

[01:55:28.320 --> 01:55:31.400]
When one night with my older son in a blockbuster's video rental store,

[01:55:31.820 --> 01:55:34.840]
I stumbled across the 12-chapter serial King of the Rocketman.

[01:55:35.520 --> 01:55:39.000]
On the front cover of this video, Bach was a picture of none other than Commando Cody.

[01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:43.440]
Needless to say, all that excitement 30 years ago that I had forgotten about came rushing back to me,

[01:55:43.660 --> 01:55:47.500]
but wait a minute, the character in this video was called Rocketman, not Commando Cody.

[01:55:47.760 --> 01:55:49.160]
See, I wasn't totally wrong, see that?

[01:55:49.640 --> 01:55:50.840]
Mm-hmm. You don't care.

[01:55:51.300 --> 01:55:52.700]
I'm not going to make rockets here about this guy.

[01:55:53.320 --> 01:55:55.360]
As I read the information on the back of the video box,

[01:55:55.500 --> 01:55:59.960]
I was thrilled to find out that there were not only three separate films made with the character he was this flight suit,

[01:56:00.280 --> 01:56:03.180]
but also the TV show Commando Cody, Sky Marshall of the Universe,

[01:56:03.320 --> 01:56:05.100]
within the year I obtained all four of these videos,

[01:56:05.520 --> 01:56:07.040]
and then it was on to describe all four of them.

[01:56:07.040 --> 01:56:09.300]
King of the Rocketman, radar men from the moon.

[01:56:09.600 --> 01:56:10.300]
Oh yeah, that's good.

[01:56:10.860 --> 01:56:12.960]
Zombies of the stratosphere, and Commando Cody,

[01:56:13.360 --> 01:56:15.200]
Sky Marshall of the Universe, radar men from the moon.

[01:56:15.300 --> 01:56:17.240]
That's a good one, baby, staring George Wallace,

[01:56:17.420 --> 01:56:18.640]
not the one in the wheelchair who died.

[01:56:21.380 --> 01:56:25.220]
Well, it goes on about the stunts, the scenes that they did,

[01:56:25.540 --> 01:56:29.640]
and the dummy takeoff scenes were filmed with the dummy going backward down wires

[01:56:29.640 --> 01:56:32.980]
when the film would be printed and reversed, resulting in an authentic takeoff effect.

[01:56:33.280 --> 01:56:35.860]
And when he put this outfit on, he could fly like Superman, baby.

[01:56:35.860 --> 01:56:36.660]
Well, that's cool.

[01:56:36.800 --> 01:56:40.280]
He had like a little dial on it, and we turned it down, zoom, he could fly like a bird.

[01:56:41.060 --> 01:56:41.640]
Like a fairy?

[01:56:42.100 --> 01:56:42.660]
Like a fairy.

[01:56:43.120 --> 01:56:48.800]
The second reason why these films still have followers today is because of the excellent stunt work provided by some of the top stuntmen of the time.

[01:56:49.220 --> 01:56:51.420]
David Sharpe, one of the top names in the history of movie stunt work,

[01:56:51.460 --> 01:56:54.400]
did the Rocketman takeoff and landing scenes in the first serial,

[01:56:54.560 --> 01:56:57.260]
King of the Rocketman, and many of these scenes were used in later films.

[01:56:57.860 --> 01:57:01.000]
Furthermore, Republic known for excelling in the creation of choreographed flight scenes,

[01:57:01.380 --> 01:57:03.520]
and notable stuntmen Tom Steel and Dale Van Sickle,

[01:57:03.520 --> 01:57:07.140]
staging the flight sequences for all three serial and twelve episodes of

[01:57:07.140 --> 01:57:09.540]
Commando Cody, Sky Marshall of the Universe.

[01:57:09.780 --> 01:57:10.160]
Oh, right.

[01:57:10.360 --> 01:57:10.780]
Good stuff.

[01:57:11.760 --> 01:57:12.440]
Great crap.

[01:57:13.740 --> 01:57:15.980]
I mean, you know, nobody under the age of 100 cares about that.

[01:57:16.260 --> 01:57:16.640]
Do I care?

[01:57:16.960 --> 01:57:17.120]
No.

[01:57:17.460 --> 01:57:18.020]
There's good stuff.

[01:57:18.840 --> 01:57:22.320]
And that all comes from the thing about the comic books and the Jews and all of these things,

[01:57:22.600 --> 01:57:24.360]
and we'll smith and Hitler and all that.

[01:57:25.300 --> 01:57:25.640]
You know why?

[01:57:25.940 --> 01:57:27.620]
Dumb people say a lot of things, you know?

[01:57:28.380 --> 01:57:28.960]
That's what I hear.

[01:57:29.420 --> 01:57:31.520]
Yeah, dumb people say, as you notice on this show,

[01:57:31.520 --> 01:57:33.060]
not that we'd ever have dumb people calling in.

[01:57:33.620 --> 01:57:37.180]
But as a result of that, there's an old saying that I use a lot.

[01:57:37.460 --> 01:57:40.600]
When somebody says something absolutely unacceptable, ridiculous, grotesque,

[01:57:41.160 --> 01:57:42.100]
consider the source.

[01:57:42.820 --> 01:57:43.220]
You know what I mean?

[01:57:43.700 --> 01:57:44.060]
What do you mean?

[01:57:44.460 --> 01:57:45.660]
I'm going to start doing that in the future.

[01:57:45.780 --> 01:57:47.600]
Like when I get a big saw today and it's from Norma Cand about,

[01:57:47.600 --> 01:57:48.560]
well, what are we going to do this?

[01:57:48.660 --> 01:57:50.900]
Or I say to myself, I'm going to start saying that.

[01:57:51.200 --> 01:57:52.080]
Consider the source.

[01:57:52.520 --> 01:57:52.760]
Okay?

[01:57:53.400 --> 01:57:53.580]
Okay.

[01:57:54.600 --> 01:57:54.920]
Consider...

[01:57:54.920 --> 01:57:55.740]
Do fair with that.

[01:57:56.220 --> 01:57:56.380]
You know?

[01:57:57.360 --> 01:57:58.340]
335 votes on the pool.

[01:57:58.420 --> 01:57:59.800]
Now, what time did I put the new pool on there?

[01:57:59.800 --> 01:58:01.560]
We're not doing too bad for the day after Christmas.

[01:58:02.020 --> 01:58:03.320]
No, we got over a thousand, so we're all good.

[01:58:03.620 --> 01:58:04.160]
Oh, yeah.

[01:58:04.440 --> 01:58:05.660]
But that's three days worth.

[01:58:06.440 --> 01:58:06.800]
Shhh.

[01:58:08.900 --> 01:58:12.200]
Now, how did the guys do yesterday where they like pumping a pool a little bit?

[01:58:12.380 --> 01:58:14.260]
They were talking about a little bit and everything.

[01:58:14.460 --> 01:58:17.400]
I think my target goal was like 280 or something like that.

[01:58:17.740 --> 01:58:17.960]
Yeah.

[01:58:18.160 --> 01:58:19.740]
So we got the target goal a little bit over.

[01:58:20.280 --> 01:58:21.280]
Your target goal for what?

[01:58:21.480 --> 01:58:21.580]
Today?

[01:58:21.840 --> 01:58:23.540]
No, for yesterday's pool.

[01:58:24.360 --> 01:58:25.740]
Maybe it was 300 auto-rebootal assistance.

[01:58:25.960 --> 01:58:27.140]
We hit the target barely yesterday.

[01:58:27.560 --> 01:58:29.500]
We already had that before they started.

[01:58:29.840 --> 01:58:31.460]
There was a pool I put on there on Monday.

[01:58:31.600 --> 01:58:31.760]
Shhh.

[01:58:32.220 --> 01:58:32.520]
Yeah, no.

[01:58:35.240 --> 01:58:38.140]
Like I said, I liked it a lot better when the audio was dropping out.

[01:58:38.460 --> 01:58:38.660]
Okay.

[01:58:38.980 --> 01:58:43.960]
Oh, if you have any idea how different it is now, that's got to be one of the most annoying things.

[01:58:44.200 --> 01:58:45.840]
But, you know, I can survive.

[01:58:46.180 --> 01:58:49.840]
What I tell you a long time ago, many, many times, I am a survivor.

[01:58:50.340 --> 01:58:50.720]
You'll see.

[01:58:51.860 --> 01:58:53.560]
336 votes on the pool after I die.

[01:58:53.560 --> 01:58:54.520]
I expect a blank.

[01:58:54.780 --> 01:58:55.980]
I honestly have no clue.

[01:58:56.360 --> 01:58:56.720]
142.

[01:58:56.980 --> 01:58:58.060]
Well, let me draw you a picture of it.

[01:58:58.120 --> 01:58:59.100]
Okay, it's not real, Purdy.

[01:58:59.480 --> 01:59:00.380]
But there won't be any pain.

[01:59:00.500 --> 01:59:01.540]
It'll stop the pain.

[01:59:02.200 --> 01:59:02.940]
No more pain.

[01:59:03.220 --> 01:59:04.520]
Physical, mental, emotional.

[01:59:04.940 --> 01:59:05.540]
No more pain.

[01:59:05.660 --> 01:59:06.240]
No more distress.

[01:59:06.560 --> 01:59:07.200]
You'll be in a box.

[01:59:08.280 --> 01:59:10.680]
You got to look on the bright side like Monty Python says, right?

[01:59:10.820 --> 01:59:12.220]
I mean, there's got to be something good about death.

[01:59:12.640 --> 01:59:12.960]
Mm-hmm.

[01:59:13.620 --> 01:59:15.440]
Become nothing more than worm food, 80.

[01:59:15.960 --> 01:59:17.060]
Have a good rest, 54.

[01:59:17.480 --> 01:59:17.840]
That's right.

[01:59:18.200 --> 01:59:20.060]
When you go to hospital, there's somebody on their deathbed.

[01:59:20.420 --> 01:59:23.500]
Just moments away from their last breath say, have a good rest.

[01:59:23.500 --> 01:59:24.800]
Gang is under hate.

[01:59:25.280 --> 01:59:25.880]
Zag is on.

[01:59:26.500 --> 01:59:28.380]
Live on in the afterlife, 37.

[01:59:28.780 --> 01:59:30.120]
Be reincarnated, 17.

[01:59:30.460 --> 01:59:31.340]
Become a ghost, six.

[01:59:31.580 --> 01:59:33.980]
Don't say that if they're like a Muslim, don't say Zag is on.

[01:59:34.060 --> 01:59:35.080]
They'll get pretty pissed off.

[01:59:35.340 --> 01:59:36.500]
And they might actually come back to life.

[01:59:37.880 --> 01:59:38.820]
Well, it's pretty insane.

[01:59:39.080 --> 01:59:40.840]
When was the last time I did a woodbine Wednesday?

[01:59:40.960 --> 01:59:41.940]
It's a long time, isn't it?

[01:59:42.260 --> 01:59:43.460]
Oh, no, nobody cares about that.

[01:59:43.740 --> 01:59:44.600]
What do you care more about?

[01:59:44.700 --> 01:59:46.360]
Commando Cody or my dude in woodbine Wednesday?

[01:59:46.640 --> 01:59:47.220]
Woodbine Wednesday.

[01:59:47.480 --> 01:59:47.980]
Why is that?

[01:59:48.300 --> 01:59:50.060]
Because in the Martin Ten Amateur Lost, I mean, one.

[01:59:50.180 --> 01:59:50.660]
How much you won?

[01:59:50.660 --> 01:59:50.740]
I don't know.

[01:59:51.160 --> 01:59:52.500]
Lately, I've been on a roller, baby.

[01:59:52.660 --> 01:59:53.660]
I don't know what that's all about.

[01:59:54.240 --> 01:59:55.140]
Carb, I have no clue.

[01:59:55.280 --> 01:59:55.800]
Just blind luck.

[01:59:55.880 --> 01:59:59.300]
And I like to go, but there's almost nobody there, which lately, see, I think what they did,

[01:59:59.440 --> 02:00:01.380]
and they do in a lot of these places, they break people.

[02:00:01.520 --> 02:00:01.720]
You know what I mean?

[02:00:02.200 --> 02:00:03.700]
They've maxed out all their credit cards.

[02:00:03.820 --> 02:00:05.640]
They've lost every dime they can get their hands on.

[02:00:05.880 --> 02:00:06.820]
And you don't see them anymore.

[02:00:07.480 --> 02:00:10.060]
Well, there's a lot of people in that category that used to see all the time.

[02:00:10.260 --> 02:00:10.760]
Not no mole.

[02:00:11.260 --> 02:00:11.640]
Do you miss them?

[02:00:11.680 --> 02:00:13.380]
The parking lot, man, looks like they had a bombscare.

[02:00:13.540 --> 02:00:14.120]
Looks as empty.

[02:00:14.640 --> 02:00:15.140]
Do you miss them?

[02:00:15.600 --> 02:00:16.120]
Do I miss what?

[02:00:16.280 --> 02:00:16.740]
The chronics?

[02:00:16.800 --> 02:00:16.940]
No.

[02:00:16.940 --> 02:00:19.820]
The chronics, the chronics that would bind an electric chronics on the phone.

[02:00:20.640 --> 02:00:22.940]
And the one guy showed up there again, I figured what night it was.

[02:00:23.060 --> 02:00:24.820]
A few nights ago, he showed up there over the weekend together.

[02:00:25.040 --> 02:00:26.680]
I told you, it looks like the guy with the eyes.

[02:00:26.980 --> 02:00:28.200]
And when it says, give me a spin.

[02:00:28.520 --> 02:00:29.620]
Now, give me a spin.

[02:00:29.740 --> 02:00:30.860]
He's pointing at the third wheel.

[02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:31.920]
Give me a spin now.

[02:00:32.180 --> 02:00:33.300]
And of course, he doesn't get any.

[02:00:33.760 --> 02:00:34.560]
What a jerk.

[02:00:34.820 --> 02:00:36.600]
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, or nearly on my own business.

[02:00:36.760 --> 02:00:38.540]
I'm not a confrontational kind of person, you know?

[02:00:38.960 --> 02:00:40.520]
But I would just like to walk up to him.

[02:00:40.560 --> 02:00:41.940]
We're just leaning over and saving him.

[02:00:42.060 --> 02:00:43.400]
You are such a schmuck, man.

[02:00:43.400 --> 02:00:45.740]
If you look up schmuck in the dictionary, your picture is there.

[02:00:45.740 --> 02:00:46.540]
You're just a jerk.

[02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:48.460]
You're just an absolute idiot.

[02:00:48.900 --> 02:00:50.320]
Oh, I think he probably knows it.

[02:00:50.340 --> 02:00:52.580]
And you know, he would say, don't look at my screen.

[02:00:52.800 --> 02:00:53.780]
Don't look at my board, man.

[02:00:53.900 --> 02:00:54.540]
Don't look at my board.

[02:00:54.540 --> 02:00:55.360]
And that's the same one.

[02:00:55.360 --> 02:00:55.980]
Don't look at his board.

[02:00:56.240 --> 02:00:56.540]
The same guy.

[02:00:56.920 --> 02:00:57.060]
Yeah.

[02:00:57.800 --> 02:00:58.940]
Always with the same routine.

[02:00:59.200 --> 02:00:59.840]
Don't look at my board.

[02:00:59.980 --> 02:01:02.160]
Like, what there is this to make if I look at what he's getting or not.

[02:01:02.260 --> 02:01:05.720]
You know, if you sit next to somebody, unless you're a moron, you look, you know, when he's spinning the thing,

[02:01:05.780 --> 02:01:06.640]
you look and see what they got.

[02:01:06.980 --> 02:01:09.140]
Now, is that his bad to look over someone else's screen?

[02:01:09.780 --> 02:01:10.120]
Is it what?

[02:01:10.300 --> 02:01:13.000]
Is it like a bad thing to do or is it, you know, is it considered bent?

[02:01:13.120 --> 02:01:13.240]
Yeah.

[02:01:13.900 --> 02:01:15.980]
I mean, if you're sitting there staring at it, no.

[02:01:16.520 --> 02:01:18.420]
So, but if you just like, you know, kind of like glance over.

[02:01:18.420 --> 02:01:19.020]
Of course not.

[02:01:19.480 --> 02:01:21.560]
That's how you figure which is the hot machine, man.

[02:01:22.400 --> 02:01:25.700]
Yeah, because I'm going to tell you so I told you I won because I saw somebody winning on a machine

[02:01:25.700 --> 02:01:30.300]
and they got off prematurely and I ran over there and hopped aboard and, but I've been, got a few bucks.

[02:01:30.780 --> 02:01:34.680]
Yeah, because when I was in Vegas, you know, I'd be sitting there and, you know, you're waiting for your wheels to stop anyways.

[02:01:34.820 --> 02:01:37.100]
You know, just kind of like look over and want to, you know, for like a second.

[02:01:37.520 --> 02:01:39.580]
You know, you're supposed to be able to give you like a dirty look about that.

[02:01:39.640 --> 02:01:42.540]
Well, I don't think so, but I feel like I'm going to be like a fairy like this.

[02:01:42.540 --> 02:01:47.340]
Yeah, like with a guy with the eyes junior, a moron, a knitwood, a similar, give me another spin.

[02:01:47.720 --> 02:01:52.620]
No, give me any, he's pointing and he's pointing and he keeps spinning the thing and losing his ass and losing his ass.

[02:01:52.880 --> 02:01:55.380]
There are no spins and people are looking at him like, what's wrong with you?

[02:01:55.480 --> 02:01:56.040]
Can't you shut up?

[02:01:56.320 --> 02:01:57.500]
You idiot, you're simple than you.

[02:01:57.980 --> 02:02:02.280]

[02:02:07.180 --> 02:02:09.340]

[02:02:18.920 --> 02:02:20.080]

I'm not in the middle.

[02:07:21.180 --> 02:07:24.520]
Hello, Langside.

[02:07:25.760 --> 02:07:30.900]
We'll take a cup of kindness, yeah.

[02:07:31.740 --> 02:07:35.440]

[02:07:37.120 --> 02:07:41.920]
We'll take a cup of kindness, yeah.

[02:07:42.320 --> 02:07:45.980]

Is what, 4th to last day we figured out?

[02:07:58.340 --> 02:08:02.720]
Yeah, I believe that's what it was on Q.A.M. 4 more full more days and one of today's the number 4.

[02:08:03.960 --> 02:08:05.580]
365 speaking numbers for that guy.

[02:08:05.720 --> 02:08:07.400]
Oh, the number is with a pole.

[02:08:07.600 --> 02:08:08.100]
You with that pole.

[02:08:08.380 --> 02:08:09.900]
What's wrong with that? I'm not even giving you the result.

[02:08:10.360 --> 02:08:12.520]
365, that's a nice number. Our goal is 400.

[02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:14.080]
I just made it up.

[02:08:14.580 --> 02:08:15.140]
Stop it.

[02:08:15.200 --> 02:08:15.860]
You're the main wrong with that.

[02:08:16.340 --> 02:08:18.640]
It would be like over 11 hundred between the two poles.

[02:08:18.640 --> 02:08:20.300]
Of course, that's over what, 18, 20 days.

[02:08:21.640 --> 02:08:23.820]
Ira Churn is right on the smoking chimp.

Q debate in Iowa.

Joseph from Dallas appeared on the screen.

[02:08:30.400 --> 02:08:33.580]
I remember like it was just yesterday staring the candidates right in the eye.

[02:08:34.040 --> 02:08:36.720]
How you answer this question will tell us everything we need to know about you.

[02:08:36.820 --> 02:08:37.820]
He solemnly warned them.

[02:08:38.180 --> 02:08:42.000]
Do you believe every word of this book, specifically this book that I'm holding in my hand?

[02:08:42.280 --> 02:08:43.820]
The book, of course, was the Bible.

[02:08:44.840 --> 02:08:45.900]
What's wrong with this picture?

[02:08:46.220 --> 02:08:48.520]
Yes, it brings religion, front and center to the political arena.

[02:08:48.820 --> 02:08:50.340]
But so did the Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr.

[02:08:50.520 --> 02:08:51.940]
And hundreds of other ministers of the gospel.

[02:08:52.720 --> 02:08:54.660]
Without them, there could have been no civil rights movement.

[02:08:55.040 --> 02:08:57.680]
So I doubt we want to say that it's always wrong to make faith in politics.

[02:08:58.480 --> 02:09:01.620]
Of course, the Bible talked about how you treat your slaves and stuff like that.

[02:09:01.660 --> 02:09:04.500]
The Bible said slaves were good and stuff like that, but now forget about it.

[02:09:04.940 --> 02:09:08.020]
Even if we wanted to keep the two absolutely separate, we'd be fighting a losing battle.

[02:09:08.420 --> 02:09:11.540]
Religion has always been deeply embedded in U.S. politics for better and for worse.

[02:09:11.840 --> 02:09:12.560]
How could it be otherwise?

[02:09:13.100 --> 02:09:15.900]
You can't ask people to leave their personal values out of their political choices.

[02:09:16.300 --> 02:09:21.400]
And in a country so massively saturated with religion, you can't ask people to leave their faith out of their personal values.

[02:09:21.400 --> 02:09:24.040]
So religion will be in politics, whether we like it or not.

[02:09:24.580 --> 02:09:25.460]
And some of us don't.

[02:09:25.760 --> 02:09:29.900]
Given that the faith-bate politics mixes inevitable and sometimes a force for a progressive change,

[02:09:30.240 --> 02:09:32.620]
why does so many progressives demand religion out of politics?

[02:09:33.100 --> 02:09:35.980]
The answer we always hear is, they're trying to impose their religion on me.

[02:09:36.580 --> 02:09:37.900]
But what exactly does that mean?

[02:09:38.360 --> 02:09:42.660]
Was Dr. King trying to impose his religion upon these southern racists when he demanded integration

[02:09:42.660 --> 02:09:44.360]
because blacks to our children of God?

[02:09:45.100 --> 02:09:48.460]
More recently, progressive faith-based coalitions have won living wage campaigns.

[02:09:48.460 --> 02:09:52.840]
The small businessman who must pay their hell-pire wages may well feel that their freedom is curtailed

[02:09:52.840 --> 02:09:56.940]
due to somebody else's religious beliefs is it fair to complain that they're imposing the religion on us

[02:09:56.940 --> 02:10:00.720]
when game marriage is banned, but not when racial integration or living wage is required?

[02:10:01.080 --> 02:10:03.220]
We need to think this through carefully, Cesara.

[02:10:03.760 --> 02:10:08.040]
The real conflict between religion and politics and a democracy comes not from what people say or do,

[02:10:08.460 --> 02:10:10.940]
but how they talk about it and the authority they invoke for it.

[02:10:11.340 --> 02:10:15.060]
The underlying premise of democracy is that we human beings get to choose our laws and policies,

[02:10:15.460 --> 02:10:17.260]
not discover them inscribed in the cosmos.

[02:10:17.660 --> 02:10:22.200]
The rules that a community lives by are produced by that community and by no one or nothing else.

[02:10:22.640 --> 02:10:27.260]
Any law or policy is fair game as long as it's constitutional and achieved through the democratic process.

[02:10:27.480 --> 02:10:30.180]
Am I reading this while or not? No. It's a holiday, as what do you expect?

[02:10:30.940 --> 02:10:34.040]
The distinguished Mark of religion, too, is not in its substance, but in its style,

[02:10:34.040 --> 02:10:36.500]
according to one theory, current among some scholars of religion.

[02:10:36.900 --> 02:10:41.820]
Any belief statement or action can be religious if it claims some transcendent or supernatural authority for its truth.

[02:10:42.420 --> 02:10:48.380]
Believing in the after death or giving arms to the poor is no more intrinsically religious than praying for a million dollars,

[02:10:48.500 --> 02:10:50.340]
dancing around a tree or robbing a bank.

[02:10:50.760 --> 02:10:52.920]
I wonder if that's dancing a kazaski around the tree.

[02:10:54.240 --> 02:10:57.260]
As long as you say, hey, I didn't think this up on my own.

[02:10:57.420 --> 02:11:01.780]
I know it's right and true because some eternal transcendent authority told me so.

[02:11:02.080 --> 02:11:04.680]
It's religious and that means it can never be challenged or changed.

[02:11:05.360 --> 02:11:07.700]
But challenge and change is the essence of democracy.

[02:11:07.700 --> 02:11:11.700]
The only value of authority for political values is the truth discovered by human thought,

[02:11:12.040 --> 02:11:13.920]
which is always open to challenge and change.

[02:11:14.180 --> 02:11:17.860]
Democracy requires that all the people, either directly or through elected representatives,

[02:11:18.140 --> 02:11:24.560]
be thinking and debating about their laws and policies constantly and endlessly, every claim made in a political arena must be open to debate without limit.

[02:11:25.100 --> 02:11:28.160]
And the debate must be open everyone. No one's ideas can be excluded,

[02:11:28.480 --> 02:11:31.060]
so everybody must have equal access to the terms of the discussion.

[02:11:31.520 --> 02:11:34.860]
No special terms, like words and symbols of a particular religion, can be privileged

[02:11:34.860 --> 02:11:38.240]
because that would exclude all the people that don't find those words and symbols meaningful.

[02:11:38.640 --> 02:11:42.480]
The terms have to be secular. In other words, you can't force the go-and-to-pull-miss-us on their door.

[02:11:42.860 --> 02:11:44.760]
You got a mrs. on your door? Why not?

[02:11:45.460 --> 02:11:47.000]
What is a mrs.? Why?

[02:11:47.300 --> 02:11:47.780]
What is a mrs.?

[02:11:48.340 --> 02:11:51.200]
Those who base their political values in their religion, I'll tell you later,

[02:11:51.500 --> 02:11:54.140]
on their religion have to translate faith statements into value statements

[02:11:54.140 --> 02:11:56.580]
and non-believers can evaluate and debate in rational terms.

[02:11:56.940 --> 02:11:57.920]
That's what Dr. King did.

[02:11:58.260 --> 02:12:00.820]
When he preached that we're all woven together in a single garment of destiny,

[02:12:00.820 --> 02:12:05.840]
no doubt he had theological ideas in mind, but the concept itself is one that any atheist can think about,

[02:12:05.940 --> 02:12:08.140]
interpret and debate in purely secular terms.

[02:12:08.600 --> 02:12:10.860]
So Dr. King never imposed his religion on anyone.

[02:12:11.320 --> 02:12:13.760]
There are people who would impose their religion on us in the strict sense.

[02:12:13.760 --> 02:12:16.960]
They would turn their specific religious doctrine to practice directly into law.

[02:12:17.440 --> 02:12:21.540]
And it's worth keeping an eye on them, but it's not worth spending a whole lot ever worrying about and denouncing them,

[02:12:21.580 --> 02:12:24.220]
because there aren't that many of them, and they just aren't very powerful.

[02:12:24.620 --> 02:12:26.820]
Treating them as if they were the only inflates their power unnecessarily.

[02:12:27.520 --> 02:12:31.520]
Mid-Rondley had to go out of his way to promise he would never bring his religious doctrines directly into politics,

[02:12:31.900 --> 02:12:36.000]
not simply because he's a Mormon, but because even on the right it generally won't wash.

[02:12:36.340 --> 02:12:40.160]
The majority of people who bring their faith into politics on the right as well as the left and center

[02:12:40.560 --> 02:12:44.200]
translate that faith into statements of value couched in more or less secular terms.

[02:12:44.600 --> 02:12:47.220]
The critical question is whether they allow open-ended challenge in debate,

[02:12:47.600 --> 02:12:50.420]
whether they claim, hey, you can't challenge this because we didn't make it up.

[02:12:50.640 --> 02:12:54.100]
It comes from a transcendent authority that can never change and can never be challenged.

[02:12:54.480 --> 02:12:57.380]
If you hear that, it's fair to say, religion out of politics,

[02:12:57.800 --> 02:13:01.320]
because at that point the only response that hurts of another faith or none at all can make is,

[02:13:01.560 --> 02:13:03.560]
I don't believe you. Then there's nothing more to say.

[02:13:03.920 --> 02:13:07.760]
The conversation comes to a dead end, and that means the democratic process comes to an end.

[02:13:08.120 --> 02:13:11.660]
But unless the faithful push democracy to that end, they have a place in the political arena because,

[02:13:12.040 --> 02:13:15.520]
no matter what their motives might be, they're playing by the rules of democracy's game.

[02:13:15.920 --> 02:13:17.920]
And like they say in China, hubbum and drear.

[02:13:18.580 --> 02:13:21.900]
I return this right set on this working chip. And boy, that might cuppy, man.

[02:13:21.980 --> 02:13:25.640]
It's the last thing we need is some Bible-thumping, born-again, bigot as your president.

[02:13:25.940 --> 02:13:29.060]
Not that we don't already have one. When you think we would learn our lesson?

[02:13:29.480 --> 02:13:33.940]
Not. Not those evangelicals, man. Not those right-wing lunatics. Not those bigoted bastards.

[02:13:35.100 --> 02:13:36.960]
373 on your pool. I think we're going to make your 400.

[02:13:37.380 --> 02:13:40.280]
And then we can deck them all with the rules of holly.

[02:13:40.580 --> 02:13:42.340]
So you want to hear about them, Azusa? Yeah.

[02:13:42.880 --> 02:13:45.680]
I think you might be so inspired. You might put some on a control room door.

[02:13:45.680 --> 02:13:47.380]
Couldn't hear it.

[02:13:47.840 --> 02:13:49.140]
So, couldn't hear it.

[02:13:49.240 --> 02:13:49.960]
It's no logic.

[02:13:51.680 --> 02:13:51.760]
4658.

[02:13:53.680 --> 02:13:54.180]
4th leader.

[02:13:55.420 --> 02:13:58.280]
I know that the Lord even loves Neil Rogers.

[02:14:33.060 --> 02:14:43.100]
I know that the Lord never goes away.

[02:14:43.100 --> 02:14:46.140]
Better not even have best rights, man.

[02:14:47.100 --> 02:14:47.980]
Never gonna quit.

[02:14:48.260 --> 02:14:51.160]
It is fun that you fire up your body.

[02:14:51.480 --> 02:14:53.020]
Celebrate and substitute.

[02:14:53.740 --> 02:14:56.620]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

[02:14:56.620 --> 02:14:59.000]
Ma-ma-ma, man.

[02:14:59.480 --> 02:15:02.240]
Ma-ma-ma, man.

[02:15:02.240 --> 02:15:02.620]
Ma-ma-ma-na-ra.

[02:15:05.700 --> 02:15:09.000]
See, I don't even know Louis Sussman, huh? Well, what does that tell me?

[02:15:09.240 --> 02:15:09.340]
Who?

[02:15:10.460 --> 02:15:15.020]
17 at 560 W.D. Q.A.M. Here's the M. Azizza's stuff you wanted to hear about. You could have

[02:15:15.020 --> 02:15:18.220]
googled it yourself. The little container you see knelt to some door frames at an angle.

[02:15:18.640 --> 02:15:21.600]
It's not a container. It's a little chachki, man. It's a little of thing.

[02:15:22.120 --> 02:15:24.360]
Okay. Do you ever see a little thing? Not like you.

[02:15:24.740 --> 02:15:28.780]
A M. Azizza is a fix to the doorpost of Jewish homes to fulfill the Mitzbaugh

[02:15:28.780 --> 02:15:32.800]
biblical commandment to inscribe the words of the Shima on the doorpost of your house.

[02:15:33.220 --> 02:15:36.220]
Remember that song by Lonnie Donigan? Does your chewing gum lose its flavor on the

[02:15:36.280 --> 02:15:41.280]
bedpost overnight? Yeah, no, no, no. Now, anyway, many families face the Mitzbaugh

[02:15:41.280 --> 02:15:45.980]
on the front door only, but observant Jews fix one on air-be-doorway in the

[02:15:45.980 --> 02:15:49.000]
home apart from bathrooms. Oh, God forbid you want a full Mitzbaugh on your

[02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:53.280]
bathroom door. Oh, fat. And closets too small to qualify as rooms.

[02:15:53.960 --> 02:15:57.960]
The parchment is prepared by a qualified scribe who has undergone many years of

[02:15:57.960 --> 02:16:01.400]
meticulous training and the verses are written in indelible black ink with a

[02:16:01.400 --> 02:16:05.700]
special quill pen. The parchment is then rolled up and placed inside the case.

[02:16:06.420 --> 02:16:09.520]
According to Holocaust, the Mitzbaugh should be placed on the right side of the door

[02:16:09.520 --> 02:16:12.720]
from the point of view of the person entering the room. Are you following this

[02:16:12.720 --> 02:16:15.500]
when you go home and put yours up? You'll know where it is. Oh, I'm writing it down.

[02:16:15.880 --> 02:16:19.720]
In the upper third of the doorpost, approximately shoulder high, just like, you know,

[02:16:19.960 --> 02:16:22.500]
when you're just like your hockey stick, if it's over your shoulder, man, the gold

[02:16:22.500 --> 02:16:26.240]
won't count. With approximately three inches of the doorway opening, a minority

[02:16:26.240 --> 02:16:29.080]
opinion is that the Mitzbaugh should be affixed on the side of the sate at the

[02:16:29.080 --> 02:16:32.780]
hinge. Speaking of hockey, by the way, I bet you since it's the holidays, oh yeah,

[02:16:32.780 --> 02:16:35.940]
no, they're intramursual. I'll get back to it a minute because if we're running all

[02:16:35.940 --> 02:16:40.060]
these old, I mean, that's all they got to put on is old leaf games. Another franchise living

[02:16:40.060 --> 02:16:44.180]
in the past just like the dolphins. Well, the 72 dolphins, you know, it's like the 60s leaves,

[02:16:44.360 --> 02:16:48.980]
one four Stanley cups. That's 100 years ago. They suck. A minority opinion is that the Mitzbaugh

[02:16:48.980 --> 02:16:54.000]
should be affixed on the side opposite the hinge. In either case, Holocaust requires that Mitzbaugh

[02:16:54.000 --> 02:17:00.720]
and Mitzbaugh's oath be affixed within 30 days of moving into a rented house to the apartment.

[02:17:00.720 --> 02:17:05.540]
After 30 days, you've got to burn the hell, I guess. Oh, this applies to Jews living in the

[02:17:06.220 --> 02:17:10.620]
diaspora outside the land of Israel for a purchased home apartment in the diaspora or residents in

[02:17:10.620 --> 02:17:15.820]
Israel rented or owned. A Mitzbaugh is affixed immediately upon moving in. Don't waste any time,

[02:17:15.820 --> 02:17:20.560]
maybe nail that baby to the door. I almost said to the cross. The case can be affixed to the

[02:17:20.560 --> 02:17:25.020]
door post with nail screws, glue or double-sided tape, wrapping the school and plastic wrap before

[02:17:25.020 --> 02:17:28.940]
placing it in the casebook protected from the elements. From the elements inside your house,

[02:17:28.940 --> 02:17:32.340]
maybe you've got to hold in the roof. Care should be taken to not tear or damage the

[02:17:32.340 --> 02:17:37.140]
parchment or the wording on it as this will invalidate the Mitzbaugh. Oh my god, protect your Mitzbaugh,

[02:17:37.180 --> 02:17:44.480]
baby. What a bunch of Maloney, it's Dan Maloney.

[02:17:45.320 --> 02:17:46.800]
I'm sitting now.

[02:17:56.460 --> 02:18:01.100]
Great boy, you're filming, baby. Wow. Old Maple Leaf Gardens. What memories that brings back?

[02:18:01.280 --> 02:18:05.000]
Remember Maple Leaf Gardens? Is Chris now? Never been there. Never seen a hockey game, have you?

[02:18:05.320 --> 02:18:10.240]
Of course, I have. You have? Yeah. Where the doorway is wide enough, Ashkenazi Jews and

[02:18:10.240 --> 02:18:14.980]
Spanish and Portuguese Jews tilt the Mitzbaugh so that the top slant toward the room in which the door

[02:18:14.980 --> 02:18:19.680]
opens. Tilt your Mitzbaugh, baby. This is done to accommodate the very independence of the medieval

[02:18:19.680 --> 02:18:24.380]
rabbis, Rashi and Revenue Tom, whatever that means, as to whether it should be placed horizontally

[02:18:24.380 --> 02:18:28.920]
or vertically and will apply that God and the Torah, which the Mitzbaugh symbolizes, are entering

[02:18:28.920 --> 02:18:33.820]
the room. Most safe are deemed and other non-Ashkenazi Jews that fix the Mitzbaugh vertically.

[02:18:34.400 --> 02:18:37.760]
The procedure is to hold the Mitzbaugh against the spot on which it will be a fixed and recited

[02:18:37.760 --> 02:18:41.920]
of blessing. Marucho Tadu Nau and I can't read the rest of it. So here it is.

[02:18:42.780 --> 02:18:45.180]
Eloheno Mechhalaum, I share a kid of shadow of the Mitzbaugh Tadu,

[02:18:45.180 --> 02:18:49.660]
Vetsi Vanu, Libko, Mezzusa. Can you say I've got a Mitzbaugh in it? Well, I'm raised, it's written

[02:18:49.660 --> 02:18:50.720]
in English underneath.

[02:18:50.720 --> 02:18:56.920]
5. We've found Michael Aboula. There's some people named Ameika. Michael is come by

[02:18:56.920 --> 02:18:58.220]
one of them.

[02:18:58.780 --> 02:18:59.140]
That's right.

[02:19:02.500 --> 02:19:03.780]
I stand, go back.

[02:19:04.600 --> 02:19:08.500]
And any Jew can recite the blessing provided she or he is holding up to understand the significance

[02:19:08.500 --> 02:19:13.060]
of the Mitzbaugh after the blessing, the Mitzbaugh is attached. Before, so in other words,

[02:19:13.100 --> 02:19:15.900]
when you go home tonight, you get your little Mitzbaugh even a nail on up there on the door,

[02:19:16.040 --> 02:19:19.040]
make sure you're in the right part of the frame. Say, Ba'ruh-hatadu Nau.

[02:19:19.520 --> 02:19:21.140]
Ba'ruh-hatadu Nau.

[02:19:21.160 --> 02:19:21.940]
That's it.

[02:19:23.020 --> 02:19:27.080]
It's all about your boba mysees, but it'll be like that, just do like that.

[02:19:27.260 --> 02:19:31.000]
And you're going to burn in hell, Mr. Let me tell you right now. You're going to burn in hell, Nau.

[02:19:31.440 --> 02:19:35.100]
Because you won't find the fairy tales. The only fairy, you know, of his that's right,

[02:19:35.200 --> 02:19:39.240]
that kind of fairy, that kind of Tom Brady man, crush admiration.

[02:19:39.960 --> 02:19:41.860]
What's his name on Spider-Man? What's the guy?

[02:19:42.260 --> 02:19:43.300]
The actor. James...

[02:19:44.600 --> 02:19:45.340]
James Something.

[02:19:45.640 --> 02:19:45.940]
Marsden.

[02:19:45.940 --> 02:19:47.280]
You play Spider-Man's buddy, huh?

[02:19:47.380 --> 02:19:48.200]
Mars... James Marsden.

[02:19:48.540 --> 02:19:50.760]
Not James Marsden, that's another hot guy, wow.

[02:19:50.960 --> 02:19:51.040]
Woo!

[02:19:51.540 --> 02:19:52.940]
No, James something out of the look at up.

[02:19:53.280 --> 02:19:54.320]
Just a little Spider-Man.

[02:19:54.620 --> 02:19:54.860]
Don't know.

[02:19:56.260 --> 02:19:58.200]
388 on your full, we're approaching that 400 mark.

[02:19:58.320 --> 02:20:00.280]
Boy, if we can do that plus that other phenomenal job,

[02:20:00.300 --> 02:20:04.440]
maybe yesterday with Curtis and the Beast, it would be quite an accomplishment, not.

[02:20:05.860 --> 02:20:06.980]
People, you know, they go through that thing.

[02:20:07.020 --> 02:20:08.940]
Why does he talk about this about, you know, why?

[02:20:09.040 --> 02:20:09.480]
Because I can.

[02:20:09.900 --> 02:20:11.300]
Because it aggravates a lot of people.

[02:20:11.420 --> 02:20:12.640]
Oh, you're such a bastard, yeah.

[02:20:12.940 --> 02:20:13.800]
That's why I'm on the right, though.

[02:20:14.220 --> 02:20:14.820]
What is it?

[02:20:15.040 --> 02:20:15.720]
James Franco.

[02:20:16.180 --> 02:20:17.900]
James Franco, baby, Franco-American.

[02:20:19.300 --> 02:20:19.940]
In a can.

[02:20:20.580 --> 02:20:21.900]
Go tell Larry Craig it's in the can.

[02:20:22.240 --> 02:20:22.840]
He'll go chase it.

[02:20:23.680 --> 02:20:27.020]
You know, that thing where he says he has a wide stance, you know, I just...

[02:20:27.020 --> 02:20:27.920]
Have you ever thought about that?

[02:20:28.080 --> 02:20:30.740]
I mean, I don't want to be a graphic in the middle of lunchtime for a lot of people,

[02:20:30.800 --> 02:20:33.540]
but when he goes in the TV room, he has a wide stance.

[02:20:34.660 --> 02:20:35.460]
Wait until you hear this.

[02:20:35.560 --> 02:20:38.000]
This is going to piss off a lot of hispanics, man.

[02:20:38.120 --> 02:20:40.780]
A lot of Julio is going to be really p-oated, a Fred Thompson.

[02:20:41.160 --> 02:20:42.580]
Whatever hell's name is, that Nazi.

[02:20:43.200 --> 02:20:47.260]
Thompson says immigrants deserve some blame for the mortgage crisis and agrees with voters'

[02:20:47.420 --> 02:20:50.120]
assessment that the Spanish language is sickening.

[02:20:50.580 --> 02:20:52.220]
I think he's sickening is what I think.

[02:20:52.740 --> 02:20:55.360]
What a statement that is to make.

[02:20:55.580 --> 02:20:58.020]
Why doesn't he just put the mustache in his swastik on his forehead?

[02:20:59.760 --> 02:21:02.360]
Swastik on his lip and the mustache on his forehead would be good.

[02:21:02.880 --> 02:21:05.340]
During what must have been a strenuous day of campaigning in Iowa,

[02:21:06.080 --> 02:21:10.560]
Republican candidate Fred Thompson told potential voters that at his one and only appearance

[02:21:10.560 --> 02:21:12.840]
that immigrants deserve some of the blame for the mortgage crisis.

[02:21:13.300 --> 02:21:16.120]
A lot of them couldn't communicate with the people that were getting the mortgage from the lagging

[02:21:16.120 --> 02:21:19.980]
Republican total Iowa audience during his clear conservative choice bus tour.

[02:21:21.240 --> 02:21:24.020]
Thompson's stop in Mason City, Iowa allowed him to plan

[02:21:24.020 --> 02:21:28.180]
Republican fears of immigrants and refund a current frustration with hearing options in Spanish

[02:21:28.180 --> 02:21:29.340]
on recorded phone messages.

[02:21:29.820 --> 02:21:33.740]
Janice Easley, one voter in the audience, was boiling with frustration and having to hear

[02:21:33.740 --> 02:21:37.500]
Power LS Vanyole, Prince Ados, whenever she called the power company.

[02:21:37.500 --> 02:21:40.220]
Everything in Spanish, she said it's sickening.

[02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:45.560]
Power LS Vanyole, Prince Ados, usually it's Phara France.

[02:21:46.320 --> 02:21:50.360]
Prince, however they say it here, if you dial something you'll like for frog.

[02:21:50.760 --> 02:21:54.440]
You are so right, Thompson said calling for English to be made the national language

[02:21:54.440 --> 02:21:58.400]
before placing the blame for a subprime mortgage crisis on non-English speakers.

[02:21:59.200 --> 02:22:02.240]
Thompson's anti-immigrant rhetoric, which apparently wasn't limited just to those people

[02:22:02.240 --> 02:22:05.840]
who under the West illegally, came as the former Tennessee Senator and Law and Order star

[02:22:05.840 --> 02:22:08.500]
tried to breed some life into his Lanceluster campaign.

[02:22:08.900 --> 02:22:12.180]
His attempt to come across as the true conservative, in other words, the real Nazi,

[02:22:12.620 --> 02:22:16.720]
came just days after the virulently anti-immigrant Tom Tencrito withdrew from the race.

[02:22:17.240 --> 02:22:20.200]
And it marked 180 degree switch from his attempt to appeal to his spandid voters

[02:22:20.200 --> 02:22:22.380]
at a Spanish language debate list in three weeks ago.

[02:22:22.900 --> 02:22:26.520]
Now, Spanish hearing things in Spanish is sickening to Fred Thompson.

[02:22:27.140 --> 02:22:29.820]
I think we do share a lot in this country whether he's Spanish or not Hispanic,

[02:22:30.040 --> 02:22:32.900]
Thompson said of the Univision sponsored GOP debate December 9.

[02:22:32.900 --> 02:22:36.440]
I think we have some of the same basic values that didn't work so now he's trying to

[02:22:36.440 --> 02:22:39.600]
bigot game, baby. The bigot card. Play the bigot card, Freddie, baby.

[02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:44.080]
For the record, a confluence of negative economic factors including the burst of the housing bubble,

[02:22:44.520 --> 02:22:46.920]
led to the subprime mortgage crisis that is shakening West economy,

[02:22:47.360 --> 02:22:50.180]
language barriers and not widely believed to be among its leading cause.

[02:22:50.180 --> 02:22:52.140]
For the record, it says, as if.

[02:22:53.300 --> 02:22:55.460]
What is the needs potpains being a dumb frog?

[02:22:55.580 --> 02:22:58.560]
The all-time playoff star for 46 points now.

[02:22:58.560 --> 02:23:02.200]
I told them for 46 points matching his IQ, Denise.

[02:23:03.700 --> 02:23:04.720]
Can you say dummy?

[02:23:08.780 --> 02:23:12.360]
Don't be with it. First is your anti-missive thing and not your anti-hockey stuff.

[02:23:12.520 --> 02:23:13.240]
Can we cut it out?

[02:23:13.480 --> 02:23:14.060]
Hey, I like hockey.

[02:23:14.800 --> 02:23:15.000]
Do you?

[02:23:15.320 --> 02:23:15.500]
Yeah.

[02:23:15.900 --> 02:23:17.620]
Well nobody else doesn't stop for what except me.

[02:23:18.100 --> 02:23:19.360]
And of course, you know, that's his livelihood.

[02:23:20.120 --> 02:23:21.440]
Now, are they racing an aqueduct today?

[02:23:21.580 --> 02:23:23.360]
Is that the third race an aqueduct actually now?

[02:23:24.300 --> 02:23:26.680]
Wow, the four horses is going to win the third race an aqueduct.

[02:23:26.680 --> 02:23:28.440]
Two bad racers already over.

[02:23:29.720 --> 02:23:31.880]
That first assure what a boring day it was yesterday.

[02:23:32.180 --> 02:23:35.060]
They had the highlights from the year in Thurbridge and Harnessed Racing on all day

[02:23:35.060 --> 02:23:36.400]
over and over again.

[02:23:36.640 --> 02:23:38.800]
And I watched it all day over and over again.

[02:23:39.360 --> 02:23:40.680]
It's Christmas day, baby.

[02:23:40.780 --> 02:23:41.440]
It's the end of the day.

[02:23:41.620 --> 02:23:41.820]
I'm a kid.

[02:23:42.060 --> 02:23:42.920]
It's new projects.

[02:23:43.380 --> 02:23:44.140]
48 to 5.

[02:23:44.320 --> 02:23:45.300]
60 QAM.

[02:23:45.520 --> 02:23:47.100]
The fourth leader.

[02:23:48.600 --> 02:23:51.360]
Can unwrap all the slime all the time.

[02:23:51.940 --> 02:23:54.040]
New kids on the block have been sweeping the country.

[02:23:55.700 --> 02:23:59.240]
And now comes Helen Dale's answer to new kids on the block.

[02:24:01.060 --> 02:24:03.580]
It's Gerrondon music with a message.

[02:24:06.420 --> 02:24:08.400]
Oh, hearts in the condo.

[02:24:08.920 --> 02:24:11.780]
Oh, I saw you on my wife's hair just.

[02:24:12.500 --> 02:24:13.500]
Oh, I know.

[02:24:14.380 --> 02:24:16.980]
35 bad and she don't know.

[02:24:17.660 --> 02:24:21.460]
Oh, the credit recording artist told hearts in the condo with their new smash album.

[02:24:21.960 --> 02:24:22.940]
Friends and animals.

[02:24:22.940 --> 02:24:24.880]
Oh, I sat here.

[02:24:25.760 --> 02:24:28.620]
It was like, there's so good for you.

[02:24:29.260 --> 02:24:30.800]
Sweet and long.

[02:24:32.480 --> 02:24:34.780]
The whole of the old times we made our own.

[02:24:35.520 --> 02:24:37.140]
We're gonna summon it and then it runs.

[02:24:37.280 --> 02:24:39.780]
We're going to drive into the woods around the other days.

[02:24:40.200 --> 02:24:42.620]
And we found one of the close to the block of our way.

[02:24:42.820 --> 02:24:44.180]
So we found across the street.

[02:24:44.360 --> 02:24:48.300]
We walked across the road that a truck gets my wife and it squashed her like a cold.

[02:24:48.620 --> 02:24:50.520]
Oh, hearts in the condo.

[02:24:50.520 --> 02:24:53.900]
Cast the tour by the album before they expire.

[02:24:54.160 --> 02:24:54.940]
I'm all good ones.

[02:24:55.140 --> 02:24:56.080]
I'm all good ones.

[02:24:56.260 --> 02:24:58.180]
No, I'm at sea on my wife's life.

[02:24:58.440 --> 02:25:01.100]
They raised the price on polygrap so I'm sorry.

[02:25:01.400 --> 02:25:02.540]
I can't leave a tip.

[02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:04.420]
First there were new kids on the block.

[02:25:04.820 --> 02:25:07.160]
Now old hearts in the condo.

[02:25:07.220 --> 02:25:08.100]
Oh, I know.

[02:25:08.660 --> 02:25:10.660]
I saw you on my wife's hair just.

[02:25:11.320 --> 02:25:12.180]
Oh, I know.

[02:25:12.500 --> 02:25:13.880]
Old hearts in the condo.

[02:25:14.240 --> 02:25:15.460]
By the album, friends and animals.

[02:25:15.840 --> 02:25:19.280]
And get your tickets for the first live with any wickety bastard ticket outlets.

[02:25:21.100 --> 02:25:25.360]
The third time they've been one Lopez striking to the lead.

[02:25:25.560 --> 02:25:30.340]
Yes, it's too sherry is now back to second with girl power up on the outside.

[02:25:30.440 --> 02:25:31.380]
Third race of Tampa Bay.

[02:25:31.480 --> 02:25:32.480]
Downsman pretty exciting.

[02:25:32.580 --> 02:25:33.600]
This guy's another lunatic.

[02:25:33.860 --> 02:25:34.900]
They're all going to be Tom Durkin.

[02:25:35.040 --> 02:25:38.140]
Man, I want that screaming and yelling and puking.

[02:25:38.260 --> 02:25:39.580]
I don't know when you work in Tampa Bay.

[02:25:40.060 --> 02:25:40.960]
What does that tell you?

[02:25:41.020 --> 02:25:41.120]
Right?

[02:25:41.360 --> 02:25:43.880]
If you reach the cesspool of the universe, uh-huh.

[02:25:44.300 --> 02:25:45.500]
You missed the glorious days, man.

[02:25:45.620 --> 02:25:47.440]
I would eat when we were shaman cast on WS.

[02:25:47.500 --> 02:25:48.080]
You went in Tampa.

[02:25:48.240 --> 02:25:48.720]
Oh boy.

[02:25:48.720 --> 02:25:50.300]
You think our callers are something?

[02:25:50.700 --> 02:25:51.960]
Oh, they kind of dead over there in Tampa Bay.

[02:25:52.060 --> 02:25:53.460]
So red next, man.

[02:25:53.660 --> 02:25:54.280]
Red next.

[02:25:54.340 --> 02:25:56.400]
How dare you say you're going to burn in hell.

[02:25:57.280 --> 02:25:58.340]
And have a nice day.

[02:25:59.200 --> 02:26:00.040]
400-5 votes.

[02:26:00.040 --> 02:26:00.620]
We did it.

[02:26:00.680 --> 02:26:01.140]
I know.

[02:26:01.140 --> 02:26:01.400]
All right.

[02:26:01.880 --> 02:26:03.720]
Which means between the uh- what was it?

[02:26:03.760 --> 02:26:05.220]
About 75 days there during the holidays.

[02:26:05.540 --> 02:26:06.600]
We got a 1100 vote.

[02:26:06.980 --> 02:26:07.240]
Uh-huh.

[02:26:07.760 --> 02:26:09.240]
What you seem to please about it.

[02:26:09.440 --> 02:26:10.280]
Listen, I know you got a plan.

[02:26:10.280 --> 02:26:10.760]
I am pretty.

[02:26:11.180 --> 02:26:12.620]
Where you going to buy your maziza.

[02:26:13.340 --> 02:26:13.660]
Uh-huh.

[02:26:14.300 --> 02:26:14.920]
I got to find out where.

[02:26:15.420 --> 02:26:16.140]
Don't they have a date?

[02:26:16.900 --> 02:26:18.700]
I used to have a sponsor 100 years ago.

[02:26:18.920 --> 02:26:19.940]
I'm sure they no longer in business.

[02:26:20.360 --> 02:26:21.140]
And the owners are all dead.

[02:26:21.940 --> 02:26:24.300]
It was like, uh- what the hell was it called?

[02:26:24.500 --> 02:26:27.440]
Where they had Jewish artifacts and stuff and books and you know, like that.

[02:26:27.900 --> 02:26:30.160]
Like you see all these Christian bookstore stuff like that?

[02:26:30.920 --> 02:26:32.360]
Maybe we could find one for you.

[02:26:32.480 --> 02:26:32.980]
Oh, that's Zach.

[02:26:33.140 --> 02:26:33.380]
How's that?

[02:26:33.660 --> 02:26:34.520]
That's Zach bringing it.

[02:26:34.560 --> 02:26:36.260]
Maybe Zach will bring him a Nora for the holidays.

[02:26:36.460 --> 02:26:36.880]
When it be nice.

[02:26:37.020 --> 02:26:37.420]
How about you Zach?

[02:26:37.820 --> 02:26:39.280]
He's probably got him nailed all over the place.

[02:26:39.480 --> 02:26:40.360]
Probably even one on his back.

[02:26:40.360 --> 02:26:41.300]
Don't even surprised me.

[02:26:41.400 --> 02:26:41.820]
Big target.

[02:26:42.340 --> 02:26:44.260]
I thought he was going to maybe sit in with us one day

[02:26:44.260 --> 02:26:45.840]
this week with George on vacation or what.

[02:26:45.840 --> 02:26:48.480]
Yeah, well, I think he's got Dolphin's stuff today and tomorrow

[02:26:48.480 --> 02:26:49.680]
and then he'll be here Friday maybe.

[02:26:49.740 --> 02:26:50.080]
Again?

[02:26:50.380 --> 02:26:50.560]
Yeah.

[02:26:51.660 --> 02:26:55.280]
Well Thursday's the big uh- bill parcels.

[02:26:55.820 --> 02:26:57.100]
Oh, welcome to town bill.

[02:26:57.340 --> 02:26:57.700]
Congratulations.

[02:26:58.040 --> 02:26:59.100]
You can't do any worse than this.

[02:26:59.520 --> 02:26:59.520]

[02:26:59.880 --> 02:27:03.480]
Hey, so if you think of a uh- if he has like a uh- press conference

[02:27:03.480 --> 02:27:06.540]
and you're during our show would you want to let them put that on the air?

[02:27:06.560 --> 02:27:07.480]
Oh, absolutely.

[02:27:07.760 --> 02:27:08.340]
Are you kidding me?

[02:27:08.740 --> 02:27:09.680]
I think he's probably worst.

[02:27:09.740 --> 02:27:11.960]
So this comes to town and we're not going to carry it on the Dolphin station.

[02:27:12.080 --> 02:27:13.260]
Get that on here, baby.

[02:27:13.260 --> 02:27:16.700]
I all of them know that we have no reservations at all with putting it on the air.

[02:27:16.880 --> 02:27:19.720]
That is correct and be sure until the earlier it starts in the longer it lasts

[02:27:19.720 --> 02:27:20.540]
the better it'll be.

[02:27:21.740 --> 02:27:23.960]
I figured you would have no problem putting it on the air because you know-

[02:27:23.960 --> 02:27:24.420]
That is correct.

[02:27:24.640 --> 02:27:26.340]
Well, how are these for crying out louders?

[02:27:26.540 --> 02:27:28.820]
You know, it's people are busy running around taking crap back.

[02:27:29.160 --> 02:27:29.400]
Exactly.

[02:27:29.980 --> 02:27:31.980]
So he's going to be there to cover that and then uh-

[02:27:31.980 --> 02:27:34.160]
I think they got a nice wallet for my birthday by the way.

[02:27:34.380 --> 02:27:34.900]
Any money in it?

[02:27:35.400 --> 02:27:35.720]
Mine.

[02:27:36.220 --> 02:27:36.700]
Well, that's not good.

[02:27:36.780 --> 02:27:38.060]
I mean, who paid for it?

[02:27:38.120 --> 02:27:38.380]
I did.

[02:27:38.700 --> 02:27:38.800]
Oh.

[02:27:39.280 --> 02:27:41.700]
But I mean- but it's the thought that counts, isn't it?

[02:27:41.700 --> 02:27:43.360]
Is the fact that I paid for it?

[02:27:43.440 --> 02:27:44.460]
Is that making it less valuable?

[02:27:44.620 --> 02:27:45.820]
Well, does someone give it to you?

[02:27:45.960 --> 02:27:46.700]
But they do have your money?

[02:27:47.280 --> 02:27:47.420]
Right.

[02:27:47.580 --> 02:27:49.300]
Do they at least put like a penny or something in it?

[02:27:50.460 --> 02:27:53.260]
See, I didn't tell the story of how I took my close personal friend to a

[02:27:53.260 --> 02:27:54.600]
Ruth Chris Monday night for uh-

[02:27:54.600 --> 02:27:55.400]
Christmas Eve dinner.

[02:27:55.700 --> 02:27:56.380]
Man, it was good.

[02:27:56.680 --> 02:27:57.720]
They were telling me that you went there last.

[02:27:57.900 --> 02:27:59.020]
I know, it didn't sit on the air though.

[02:27:59.140 --> 02:27:59.280]
No.

[02:27:59.660 --> 02:28:01.700]
But if this was a good luck, if you give a wallet or a purse,

[02:28:01.780 --> 02:28:03.540]
you're supposed to put some money in it for like good luck.

[02:28:04.580 --> 02:28:05.320]
I guess you haven't heard that.

[02:28:05.620 --> 02:28:06.860]
You are- you are relentless man.

[02:28:06.960 --> 02:28:07.640]
You're brutal.

[02:28:08.200 --> 02:28:08.380]
Why?

[02:28:08.540 --> 02:28:08.780]
You're just brutal.

[02:28:09.100 --> 02:28:09.960]
I don't know why.

[02:28:10.120 --> 02:28:10.560]
You just are.

[02:28:10.560 --> 02:28:11.920]
I think you learned it from George.

[02:28:12.080 --> 02:28:12.440]
Never.

[02:28:12.840 --> 02:28:14.580]
Just keep ripping the old man and ass.

[02:28:14.820 --> 02:28:16.440]
Keep ripping and we'll be relentless, you know.

[02:28:16.640 --> 02:28:17.640]
I was asking you a question.

[02:28:17.800 --> 02:28:19.400]
Because in my family, like-

[02:28:19.400 --> 02:28:20.400]
I never heard such a thing.

[02:28:20.520 --> 02:28:22.300]
You gave a wallet to somebody who put money in it?

[02:28:22.480 --> 02:28:23.700]
Yeah, like a dollar or whatever.

[02:28:23.860 --> 02:28:24.980]
Just like it's like a dollar.

[02:28:25.380 --> 02:28:25.380]

[02:28:25.540 --> 02:28:26.620]
How cheesy is that?

[02:28:26.880 --> 02:28:28.220]
Well, not all of us are pretty money like-

[02:28:28.220 --> 02:28:28.220]

[02:28:28.220 --> 02:28:29.620]
Dollar, and it's-

[02:28:29.620 --> 02:28:32.120]
Christ almighty, at least a thousand dollar bill.

[02:28:32.820 --> 02:28:33.260]
Do they have those?

[02:28:33.680 --> 02:28:34.260]
Yeah, they do.

[02:28:34.580 --> 02:28:35.040]
Can I have one?

[02:28:35.820 --> 02:28:36.980]
Yeah, go ask management.

[02:28:37.260 --> 02:28:38.220]
See if they'll give you one, okay?

[02:28:38.520 --> 02:28:38.980]
Yeah, they'll laugh.

[02:28:39.540 --> 02:28:41.020]
Santa Claus, this is in Danbury,

[02:28:41.140 --> 02:28:41.340]
Canada.

[02:28:41.540 --> 02:28:42.120]
You'll laugh at this.

[02:28:42.220 --> 02:28:42.780]
You'll be amused.

[02:28:43.280 --> 02:28:43.700]
I hope.

[02:28:44.400 --> 02:28:47.360]
Santa Claus is that a woman who sat on his lap was naughty and not nice.

[02:28:47.840 --> 02:28:50.640]
The Santa at the Danbury Fair in Moral said the woman

[02:28:50.640 --> 02:28:51.260]
grouped him.

[02:28:51.580 --> 02:28:53.640]
The security officer at the mall said Santa Claus has been

[02:28:54.060 --> 02:28:54.780]
sexually assaulted,

[02:28:55.100 --> 02:28:57.580]
pleased to take the lieutenant Thomas Michael said of the weekend complaint.

[02:28:58.420 --> 02:28:59.920]
Sendrama, layme, 33.

[02:29:00.180 --> 02:29:00.980]
What kind of a name is that?

[02:29:01.760 --> 02:29:03.220]
In fact, speaking of what kind of a name is,

[02:29:03.260 --> 02:29:05.300]
a guy to a place for the cowboys, his name is-

[02:29:05.300 --> 02:29:06.440]
Is it Demetrius?

[02:29:06.560 --> 02:29:07.040]
Is that his name?

[02:29:07.220 --> 02:29:07.880]
No, that's not it.

[02:29:07.880 --> 02:29:11.020]
The- Something rather, DE, I don't know what his name is.

[02:29:11.280 --> 02:29:12.980]
I keep thinking, what kind of a name is that?

[02:29:13.540 --> 02:29:14.180]
The Marcus.

[02:29:14.180 --> 02:29:14.780]
The Marcus wait.

[02:29:15.320 --> 02:29:16.000]
The Marcus wait.

[02:29:16.180 --> 02:29:17.920]
Now, is that ever done?

[02:29:18.100 --> 02:29:19.340]
I knew that's kind of an unusual name.

[02:29:19.820 --> 02:29:20.480]
Yeah, but there's a lot of-

[02:29:20.480 --> 02:29:20.880]
The Marcus?

[02:29:21.320 --> 02:29:22.180]
Yeah, there's a lot of nothing.

[02:29:22.780 --> 02:29:24.480]
The Marcus, in ways,

[02:29:24.680 --> 02:29:26.340]
San Graemma, layme, 33 of Danbury,

[02:29:26.500 --> 02:29:28.580]
was charged with sexual assault and breach of peace.

[02:29:28.920 --> 02:29:31.280]
She was released on a promised repair court in January 3.

[02:29:31.960 --> 02:29:33.780]
Police quickly found an identified layme

[02:29:33.780 --> 02:29:35.780]
because the woman was described as being on crutches

[02:29:35.780 --> 02:29:37.260]
said Captain Bob Miles.

[02:29:37.940 --> 02:29:40.620]
A call seeking comment from him, he was answered by recording Tuesday morning.

[02:29:40.960 --> 02:29:42.040]
A woman later called back and said,

[02:29:42.100 --> 02:29:42.720]
it's a false report.

[02:29:42.940 --> 02:29:43.760]
I don't know what you're talking about.

[02:29:44.240 --> 02:29:46.500]
Police didn't give the name of the disconcerted Santa,

[02:29:46.600 --> 02:29:48.940]
but said he is 65 and felt bad because

[02:29:48.940 --> 02:29:50.040]
he was awaiting the see him.

[02:29:50.280 --> 02:29:51.480]
He was apparently shocked and embarrassed

[02:29:51.480 --> 02:29:52.720]
by the whole incident, Miles said.

[02:29:53.260 --> 02:29:54.740]
A man who teaches hundreds of prospective

[02:29:55.160 --> 02:29:56.920]
Santa's every year, Santa Tim Conahan,

[02:29:57.420 --> 02:30:00.220]
president of realsantis.com said he's never heard of similar incident.

[02:30:00.560 --> 02:30:02.680]
Though it's not unusual for adults to want to pose with Santa.

[02:30:03.040 --> 02:30:05.460]
I've had some very nice ladies said on my life sub-Conahan,

[02:30:05.460 --> 02:30:07.400]
who didn't train the denberry fair Santa.

[02:30:07.800 --> 02:30:10.200]
Once in a while I'll say, I hope Mrs. Clause is going to be upset.

[02:30:10.520 --> 02:30:11.840]
You have to be discrete and kind to say,

[02:30:12.080 --> 02:30:13.100]
oh no, she'll be okay.

[02:30:13.200 --> 02:30:14.700]
You can sit here, but only for one photo.

[02:30:15.100 --> 02:30:16.480]
And let me bounce off a down a little bit.

[02:30:17.020 --> 02:30:18.560]
A spokeswoman for Cherry Hill Photo,

[02:30:18.640 --> 02:30:20.480]
the company that coordinates Santa's for denberry fair,

[02:30:20.680 --> 02:30:21.520]
declined to comment.

[02:30:21.780 --> 02:30:22.200]
She's mum.

[02:30:23.440 --> 02:30:23.960]
I'm veerous.

[02:30:24.040 --> 02:30:26.660]
Oh, there's that tiredness busy biting and chewing and killing people.

[02:30:27.780 --> 02:30:28.620]
I'm looking at it.

[02:30:28.880 --> 02:30:29.940]
Don't be mad at the tiredness.

[02:30:30.160 --> 02:30:31.220]
The existence of zoos and aquariums,

[02:30:31.220 --> 02:30:32.600]
Breonna just mentioned them earlier.

[02:30:33.000 --> 02:30:34.620]
They said their entire heart goes out.

[02:30:34.620 --> 02:30:35.620]
Our deepest...

[02:30:35.620 --> 02:30:37.140]
Their entire heart goes out.

[02:30:37.220 --> 02:30:38.020]
How do you like that? The zoo?

[02:30:38.380 --> 02:30:38.800]
Their entire heart.

[02:30:38.820 --> 02:30:39.740]
Not just part of their heart.

[02:30:39.960 --> 02:30:40.800]
Not just the aorta.

[02:30:41.160 --> 02:30:42.440]
The entire heart goes out.

[02:30:42.760 --> 02:30:43.740]
Doesn't that make you feel better?

[02:30:44.180 --> 02:30:44.480]
Of course.

[02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:47.620]
Our heart goes out to so and so.

[02:30:47.880 --> 02:30:49.400]
And we wish that my God's speed,

[02:30:49.840 --> 02:30:51.000]
if God were around there,

[02:30:51.100 --> 02:30:52.320]
He wouldn't let this happen in the first place.

[02:30:52.540 --> 02:30:52.660]
Okay?

[02:30:52.920 --> 02:30:54.260]
He'd keep his eye on those damn tigers.

[02:30:54.940 --> 02:30:55.800]
Are they Bengal tigers?

[02:30:55.960 --> 02:30:58.120]
Are the fins playing the Bengals this weekend?

[02:30:58.340 --> 02:30:58.960]
Oh my God.

[02:30:59.300 --> 02:30:59.700]
Oh, huh.

[02:30:59.960 --> 02:31:00.820]
I'm warning you right now.

[02:31:00.900 --> 02:31:01.520]
They could win that game.

[02:31:01.600 --> 02:31:02.500]
I'm telling you right now.

[02:31:02.500 --> 02:31:04.560]
If there's any other team that they could be

[02:31:04.560 --> 02:31:07.640]
besides the offenseless Baltimore Ravens,

[02:31:07.640 --> 02:31:10.200]
it's since the 90s because they're so inconsistent.

[02:31:10.840 --> 02:31:13.800]
Some weeks they show like shades of what they were last year, you know?

[02:31:14.260 --> 02:31:15.560]
And then there are other weeks when they look like

[02:31:15.560 --> 02:31:18.960]
a scrimmage team like how much are high school kids?

[02:31:19.300 --> 02:31:19.640]
Am I right?

[02:31:19.960 --> 02:31:20.080]
Yes?

[02:31:20.620 --> 02:31:20.880]
Mm-hmm.

[02:31:21.560 --> 02:31:23.680]
Now if we got any Orthodox Jews out there in the audience,

[02:31:23.680 --> 02:31:25.580]
please bring them a Zizubai for Christmas.

[02:31:26.080 --> 02:31:27.580]
Savings from the Old Evil.

[02:31:27.720 --> 02:31:29.760]
This challenge here is not a project.

[02:31:30.040 --> 02:31:31.960]
Beware of exploding balls.

[02:31:31.960 --> 02:31:34.520]
I guess I'll be talking sports today and not about the YouTube

[02:31:35.320 --> 02:31:36.400]
pornography stuff like that.

[02:31:36.420 --> 02:31:36.640]
Correct.

[02:31:37.140 --> 02:31:38.040]
Well thank God for that.

[02:31:38.140 --> 02:31:39.240]
We certainly don't want to interrupt these

[02:31:39.240 --> 02:31:40.820]
sanctity as sports for more than four hours.

[02:31:41.160 --> 02:31:42.840]
In Elizabeth Holtzman's got a good column here.

[02:31:43.140 --> 02:31:45.340]
No vice president is above the law for nothing been post.

[02:31:45.960 --> 02:31:47.180]
Well this is from a couple weeks ago.

[02:31:47.420 --> 02:31:48.760]
I haven't been doing my duty, you know?

[02:31:48.920 --> 02:31:51.000]
Because we've had all this other fall to all going on.

[02:31:52.180 --> 02:31:53.180]
You know what I mean by that?

[02:31:53.560 --> 02:31:53.900]
What do you mean?

[02:31:54.340 --> 02:31:56.100]
I haven't been reading all my bedtime stories

[02:31:56.100 --> 02:31:56.940]
because I don't know.

[02:31:57.020 --> 02:32:00.160]
We've been in the middle of a whole maelstrom of controversy.

[02:32:00.720 --> 02:32:01.380]
What kind of controversy?

[02:32:01.380 --> 02:32:02.700]
Elizabeth Holtzman is great.

[02:32:02.820 --> 02:32:03.620]
I'm not going into it.

[02:32:03.720 --> 02:32:04.840]
You know something you better watch

[02:32:04.840 --> 02:32:07.300]
I'm going to take them to Zizubai and stick it in the mundo and shine.

[02:32:07.480 --> 02:32:08.200]
And both feet too.

[02:32:08.400 --> 02:32:09.140]
Is there any guilt in it?

[02:32:11.940 --> 02:32:13.260]
No, but there's a lot of guilt.

[02:32:13.780 --> 02:32:14.160]
What is guilt?

[02:32:14.820 --> 02:32:15.540]
Former money.

[02:32:15.880 --> 02:32:16.120]
Okay.

[02:32:16.500 --> 02:32:17.480]
Oh who told you to say that?

[02:32:17.820 --> 02:32:17.980]
Eric.

[02:32:18.560 --> 02:32:18.860]
Oh, Eric.

[02:32:19.020 --> 02:32:19.760]
What does Eric know?

[02:32:19.860 --> 02:32:21.540]
What does Eric know about Yiddish?

[02:32:21.960 --> 02:32:22.700]
I guess he's good at that.

[02:32:23.220 --> 02:32:24.660]
Former congresswoman Elizabeth Holtzman,

[02:32:24.760 --> 02:32:26.720]
she was on the House Judiciary Committee during Nixon's impeachment.

[02:32:27.160 --> 02:32:27.620]
She's great.

[02:32:28.020 --> 02:32:28.680]
One of my heroes.

[02:32:28.680 --> 02:32:31.760]
She writes for the first time since the Bush administration took office.

[02:32:32.120 --> 02:32:34.300]
Three members of the House Judiciary Committee, Robert Wessler,

[02:32:34.700 --> 02:32:37.440]
Luis Pudiera, and Tammy Baldwin are calling for hearings on the impeachment

[02:32:37.440 --> 02:32:39.120]
of Vice President Dick Cheney.

[02:32:39.560 --> 02:32:41.640]
Their position while courageous is not surprising.

[02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:43.880]
What is surprising is that it took this long

[02:32:43.880 --> 02:32:45.820]
from every of the Congress to invoke impeachment.

[02:32:46.140 --> 02:32:48.540]
And even now they do so against the enormous political resistance

[02:32:48.540 --> 02:32:50.320]
and cynical indifference from the media.

[02:32:51.200 --> 02:32:53.020]
No serious student of the Constitution would question

[02:32:53.020 --> 02:32:54.560]
that sufficient grounds exist to impeach

[02:32:54.560 --> 02:32:56.720]
both President Bush and Vice President Cheney.

[02:32:56.720 --> 02:32:58.600]
The Constitution provides that the executive

[02:32:58.600 --> 02:33:02.240]
who puts himself above the law and abuses the power of his office may be impeached,

[02:33:02.560 --> 02:33:05.040]
applied confirmed in the impeachment proceedings against President Nixon

[02:33:05.040 --> 02:33:07.260]
for abuses such as illegal wiretapping.

[02:33:07.640 --> 02:33:09.460]
There is little serious debate about whether

[02:33:09.460 --> 02:33:10.580]
Bush administration actions,

[02:33:10.920 --> 02:33:12.260]
wiretapping without court approval,

[02:33:12.720 --> 02:33:15.300]
authorizing and facilitating mistreatment of detainees,

[02:33:15.680 --> 02:33:17.180]
meet the Constitutional standard,

[02:33:17.700 --> 02:33:20.480]
starting the Iraq war on a basis of lies,

[02:33:21.020 --> 02:33:22.360]
exaggeration and misdivance as well.

[02:33:22.860 --> 02:33:24.840]
So why hasn't the majority of Congress supported it?

[02:33:24.840 --> 02:33:28.040]
Plenty members' co-sponsored representative Dennis Kocinic's resolution

[02:33:28.040 --> 02:33:29.940]
calling for the impeachment of Cheney

[02:33:29.940 --> 02:33:31.460]
but buck their leadership to do so.

[02:33:31.820 --> 02:33:34.020]
Democratic leaders took impeachment off the table,

[02:33:34.300 --> 02:33:36.680]
apparently appearing to have heard their chances in 2008.

[02:33:37.140 --> 02:33:38.480]
Does the leadership defend the administration

[02:33:38.480 --> 02:33:40.200]
content that the sanctions are unimpeachable

[02:33:40.200 --> 02:33:43.220]
or argue that they don't rise to the level of abuse for which Nixon was impeached?

[02:33:43.560 --> 02:33:44.340]
Remarkably no.

[02:33:44.780 --> 02:33:46.440]
They publicly say there is no time

[02:33:46.440 --> 02:33:48.680]
and that impeachment proceedings would distract the Congress

[02:33:48.680 --> 02:33:50.020]
from other work and divide the country.

[02:33:50.440 --> 02:33:52.480]
These arguments are laughable compared to the imperative

[02:33:52.480 --> 02:33:53.580]
to uphold the Constitution,

[02:33:53.900 --> 02:33:55.380]
and even on their own terms, they're species.

[02:33:55.980 --> 02:33:57.260]
Let's take them one at a time.

[02:33:57.920 --> 02:34:00.880]
In the case of Nixon, the House officially instructed the Judiciary Committee

[02:34:00.880 --> 02:34:02.280]
to act in early February 74,

[02:34:02.740 --> 02:34:05.120]
the Committee finished voting the articles of impeachment July 29,

[02:34:05.340 --> 02:34:06.300]
less than six months later.

[02:34:06.840 --> 02:34:09.780]
No presidential impeachment proceeding had taken place for almost a hundred years

[02:34:09.780 --> 02:34:11.620]
so the Committee had to start from scratch,

[02:34:11.940 --> 02:34:14.840]
analyzing the Constitution and developing procedures for the impeachment inquiry.

[02:34:15.240 --> 02:34:16.920]
Now the relevant legal spade work is done

[02:34:16.920 --> 02:34:19.300]
and a road map for proper impeachment proceeding exists.

[02:34:19.720 --> 02:34:22.380]
Congress could probably conduct them even faster than in 1974

[02:34:23.180 --> 02:34:26.260]
During Watergate, the House Judiciary Committee conducted the impeachment inquiry.

[02:34:26.660 --> 02:34:28.340]
It didn't deter the rest of the House and the entire Senate

[02:34:28.340 --> 02:34:30.220]
from getting their work done even with a war on.

[02:34:30.640 --> 02:34:33.220]
Even the Judiciary Committee also worked on other matters during impeachment

[02:34:33.220 --> 02:34:35.760]
just as the Senate did during its trial of President Clinton.

[02:34:36.600 --> 02:34:38.760]
And Nixon's impeachment united the American people.

[02:34:38.840 --> 02:34:39.860]
The process was bipartisan,

[02:34:40.560 --> 02:34:43.160]
demonstrating this wasn't just a democratic plight of one to one election.

[02:34:43.780 --> 02:34:46.000]
The fairness of the process, the seriousness of the purpose,

[02:34:46.380 --> 02:34:48.740]
the substantial evidence all gave the public a strong sense

[02:34:48.740 --> 02:34:50.200]
that just as had been done.

[02:34:50.200 --> 02:34:53.720]
This reinvigorated the shared value of that rule of law and preservation of democracy

[02:34:53.720 --> 02:34:56.100]
and are more important than any President or party.

[02:34:56.440 --> 02:35:00.220]
Currently, this value is expressing itself in grassroots impeachment movements across the country.

[02:35:00.340 --> 02:35:03.500]
The Vermont Senate, several state democratic parties and many municipal governments

[02:35:03.500 --> 02:35:05.740]
have adopted resolutions supporting impeachment.

[02:35:06.040 --> 02:35:10.420]
More state legislators would have acted to set for pressure not to do it from Democrats in Washington.

[02:35:11.080 --> 02:35:14.140]
Multiple polls show a majority of Americans supporting the impeachment of Cheney.

[02:35:14.440 --> 02:35:18.220]
In November 13th American Research Group polls says 70% of Americans believe

[02:35:18.220 --> 02:35:21.220]
Vice President Cheney views his office and slightly less than the majority

[02:35:21.220 --> 02:35:22.380]
supporting the impeachment of Bush.

[02:35:22.880 --> 02:35:27.500]
The Democratic leadership tactic of stonewalling this widespread public sentiment is itself divisive,

[02:35:27.840 --> 02:35:29.480]
leaning at least half the country to frustration,

[02:35:29.720 --> 02:35:31.920]
disaffection, and shaken faith in our democracy.

[02:35:32.380 --> 02:35:35.180]
Only a sober, serious hearing about it and some hearings would heal the split.

[02:35:36.060 --> 02:35:38.960]
When Nixon's impeachment process began, he had recently been reelected

[02:35:38.960 --> 02:35:40.860]
with one of the largest landslides in history.

[02:35:41.200 --> 02:35:44.140]
No one made the calculation about whether impeachment was a political winner for Congress.

[02:35:44.600 --> 02:35:46.680]
Public opinions simply forced Congress's hand

[02:35:46.680 --> 02:35:49.180]
after Nixon fired special prosecutor Archibald Cox.

[02:35:49.680 --> 02:35:52.780]
After the House Judiciary Committee conducted an impartial hearing subordinate on impeachment,

[02:35:53.320 --> 02:35:54.520]
Congress's approval soared.

[02:35:54.840 --> 02:35:57.340]
Republicans were swamped in the November 1974 elections.

[02:35:58.160 --> 02:36:02.580]
Whether or not they bring electoral rewards in 2008 impeachment proceedings are the right thing to do.

[02:36:02.940 --> 02:36:06.540]
Regardless of outcome, they'll help curb the serious abuses of this administration

[02:36:06.540 --> 02:36:08.980]
and send a strong message to future administration.

[02:36:09.320 --> 02:36:10.840]
The Constitution means what it says.

[02:36:11.220 --> 02:36:13.560]
No President or Vice President is above the law.

[02:36:13.560 --> 02:36:15.900]
Says the great Elizabeth Holtzman.

[02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:17.460]
You go, girl. She's good.

[02:36:18.340 --> 02:36:21.200]
Aren't too many politicians going to give you a nickel for Bobby Waxley.

[02:36:21.320 --> 02:36:22.640]
There's a good guy right there in Florida.

[02:36:23.360 --> 02:36:26.080]
How come we don't have Bobby Waxley right and for running for prison?

[02:36:27.080 --> 02:36:30.480]
Maybe you can take up some of your holiday guilt and start a campaign.

[02:36:31.040 --> 02:36:31.880]
Okay, I'll get it right on it.

[02:36:32.080 --> 02:36:32.540]
Holiday guilt.

[02:36:33.140 --> 02:36:34.240]
Eric told you to say guilt?

[02:36:34.580 --> 02:36:34.900]
See.

[02:36:35.360 --> 02:36:38.260]
What is this? You guys got like a daisy chain going or something or what?

[02:36:38.460 --> 02:36:40.540]
No, so you know that whole chat room thing.

[02:36:40.940 --> 02:36:42.280]
Are you in the chat room?

[02:36:42.280 --> 02:36:42.960]
Well, yeah.

[02:36:45.100 --> 02:36:47.520]
Like whenever there's something that needs to be changed for the poll.

[02:36:47.760 --> 02:36:49.300]
And I can't do it. I gotta ask him.

[02:36:49.500 --> 02:36:50.760]
So what do you mean by that?

[02:36:51.180 --> 02:36:53.040]
Well, like if we have a mistake.

[02:36:53.340 --> 02:36:53.560]
Yeah.

[02:36:53.940 --> 02:36:57.160]
Like a verb made a mistake or I made a mistake or you know,

[02:36:57.280 --> 02:36:58.180]
I made a mistake.

[02:36:58.360 --> 02:36:59.280]
Oh, when that was that.

[02:36:59.580 --> 02:36:59.800]
Never.

[02:36:59.940 --> 02:37:00.660]
Oh my god.

[02:37:00.700 --> 02:37:01.380]
Damn god.

[02:37:02.080 --> 02:37:03.420]
Believe me, I made a lot of mistakes.

[02:37:03.560 --> 02:37:04.880]
I'm not going to recount them all right now.

[02:37:05.140 --> 02:37:05.420]
Normal.

[02:37:05.640 --> 02:37:06.480]
I made a lot of mistakes.

[02:37:07.160 --> 02:37:08.860]
After I die, I expect a blank.

[02:37:08.860 --> 02:37:09.800]
That's our poll question.

[02:37:09.800 --> 02:37:11.060]
We got 422 votes.

[02:37:11.060 --> 02:37:12.780]
This is what we put on there in midstream today.

[02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:14.160]
Like right in the middle of the show.

[02:37:14.260 --> 02:37:15.260]
Because I took the other one off.

[02:37:15.300 --> 02:37:16.380]
Because it was all right.

[02:37:16.780 --> 02:37:17.740]
Was it about, was it about,

[02:37:17.740 --> 02:37:20.420]
was a pain, pain electomies and the stuff like that?

[02:37:20.580 --> 02:37:20.700]
Yeah.

[02:37:20.740 --> 02:37:22.920]
Call up Mr. Ego. He'll tell you all about fake body parts.

[02:37:23.360 --> 02:37:25.260]
By the way, I mentioned to you about his website.

[02:37:25.700 --> 02:37:25.960]
No.

[02:37:26.400 --> 02:37:28.280]
I was googling one of the articles about me.

[02:37:28.420 --> 02:37:29.560]
That's been written in the past couple weeks.

[02:37:29.640 --> 02:37:33.260]
And somehow there came across a link to Steve Kane's website.

[02:37:33.600 --> 02:37:34.020]
Oh yeah.

[02:37:34.020 --> 02:37:36.040]
It's all about you and what's all about me and Randy.

[02:37:36.620 --> 02:37:37.140]
What is that?

[02:37:37.220 --> 02:37:38.060]
Talk about an obsession.

[02:37:39.420 --> 02:37:42.060]
Obsessed with links to the jick article and links to this.

[02:37:42.540 --> 02:37:43.600]
What is that?

[02:37:43.940 --> 02:37:44.380]
He loves you.

[02:37:44.760 --> 02:37:46.260]
And there's a picture of him in Brian Craig.

[02:37:46.420 --> 02:37:47.660]
It looks like they're, I don't know.

[02:37:48.260 --> 02:37:48.880]
Pretty cozy.

[02:37:51.560 --> 02:37:52.280]
Little Brian.

[02:37:52.660 --> 02:37:53.420]
He used to look pretty good though.

[02:37:53.540 --> 02:37:54.060]
Brian, I'll tell you.

[02:37:54.300 --> 02:37:56.000]
Long time ago though, I bet he don't look too good now.

[02:37:56.620 --> 02:37:58.500]
Anyway, after I die, I expect a blank.

[02:37:59.100 --> 02:38:00.140]
I honestly have no clue.

[02:38:00.640 --> 02:38:01.000]
172.

[02:38:01.280 --> 02:38:01.800]
Well, guess what?

[02:38:01.920 --> 02:38:04.140]
Once you're dead, you're dead for a long time.

[02:38:04.440 --> 02:38:05.540]
That's just me talking.

[02:38:05.760 --> 02:38:07.020]
You know, making sounds with my mouth.

[02:38:07.020 --> 02:38:08.280]
But it's a good guess.

[02:38:08.980 --> 02:38:10.900]
Become nothing more than worm food 102.

[02:38:11.080 --> 02:38:12.140]
Boy, Charlie B.

[02:38:12.440 --> 02:38:14.840]
Or Charlie B was PO yesterday because everything was closed

[02:38:14.840 --> 02:38:16.660]
and he's tired of the going, running, running the world.

[02:38:16.900 --> 02:38:18.020]
It's a great chivaldi Charlie.

[02:38:18.220 --> 02:38:18.740]
He used to it.

[02:38:18.840 --> 02:38:19.240]
Oh, see, Josh?

[02:38:19.800 --> 02:38:20.300]
I don't know.

[02:38:20.460 --> 02:38:21.120]
I'm, we must be.

[02:38:21.240 --> 02:38:22.020]
Or maybe in atheists.

[02:38:22.100 --> 02:38:22.500]
Soon I was.

[02:38:22.720 --> 02:38:24.000]
He's not part of the God's squad.

[02:38:24.100 --> 02:38:24.540]
Let's put it there.

[02:38:24.580 --> 02:38:25.480]
He's not a Jesus Christ.

[02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:27.580]
After I die, I expect to have a good rest.

[02:38:27.820 --> 02:38:28.160]
172.

[02:38:28.160 --> 02:38:28.540]
Why not?

[02:38:28.880 --> 02:38:29.560]
I deserve it.

[02:38:30.020 --> 02:38:30.720]
Live on in the afterlife.

[02:38:31.160 --> 02:38:31.500]
47.

[02:38:31.780 --> 02:38:32.540]
Be reincarnated.

[02:38:32.740 --> 02:38:33.680]
20 and become a ghost.

[02:38:34.220 --> 02:38:34.780]
Only nine.

[02:38:35.340 --> 02:38:35.860]
Out of 4.

[02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:36.280]
22.

[02:38:36.280 --> 02:38:38.260]
Ghost and goblins and stuff like that.

[02:38:38.580 --> 02:38:39.840]
I could say Spooks, but then again,

[02:38:40.040 --> 02:38:42.140]
somebody would take that out of context and twisted around.

[02:38:42.360 --> 02:38:43.740]
Oh, you hear what Neil Rogers said?

[02:38:43.860 --> 02:38:44.400]
Yeah, right.

[02:38:45.520 --> 02:38:46.080]
Wouldn't they?

[02:38:46.420 --> 02:38:46.940]
Most likely.

[02:38:47.260 --> 02:38:47.620]
Yeah, probably.

[02:38:48.680 --> 02:38:50.140]
Anyway, Curtis is coming up next.

[02:38:51.120 --> 02:38:52.020]
What's your biggest name?

[02:38:52.320 --> 02:38:53.180]
The best talent.

[02:38:53.380 --> 02:38:54.440]
You know, his Neil Rogers.

[02:38:54.860 --> 02:38:56.780]
4.560 QAM.

[02:38:57.080 --> 02:38:58.640]
The fourth leader.

[02:39:01.620 --> 02:39:02.440]
It's David.

[02:39:02.440 --> 02:39:04.320]
David Miami Town.

[02:39:05.640 --> 02:39:06.700]
At 560.

[02:39:08.180 --> 02:39:09.140]
WQAM.

[02:39:10.260 --> 02:39:10.980]
That's the best.

[02:39:12.720 --> 02:39:18.840]
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

[02:39:18.900 --> 02:39:21.900]
The new light pocket, not other guys.

[02:39:22.520 --> 02:39:25.400]
Are usually hiding from what they realize.

[02:39:26.100 --> 02:39:29.440]
They want their nose in a happily-exciting,

[02:39:29.440 --> 02:39:31.380]
yellow-cocks-crack.

[02:39:33.320 --> 02:39:34.820]
Much like it's more and more,

[02:39:34.960 --> 02:39:36.200]
you can still hear me.

[02:39:36.740 --> 02:39:40.040]
My talking about sports while drinking a beer.

[02:39:40.280 --> 02:39:43.020]
They desire a course to be a selfish,

[02:39:43.180 --> 02:39:46.820]
queer horse and yellow-cocks-crack.

[02:39:47.820 --> 02:39:49.300]
Yellow-cocks-crack.

[02:39:49.740 --> 02:39:51.020]
Yellow-cocks-crack.

[02:39:51.300 --> 02:39:52.580]
And the quirs want to hear.

[02:39:53.080 --> 02:39:54.160]
Sports all day.

[02:39:55.040 --> 02:39:56.440]
Yellow-cocks-crack.

[02:39:56.920 --> 02:39:58.240]
Yellow-cocks-crack.

[02:39:58.240 --> 02:40:01.740]
The fun and figure is a design of the game.

[02:40:02.280 --> 02:40:05.340]
Anyone who wants to hear just sports will stink and die.

[02:40:05.600 --> 02:40:07.500]
A history without a lot of rules.

[02:40:07.780 --> 02:40:08.980]
Go to the showers, praise.

[02:40:09.540 --> 02:40:11.040]
Yellow-cocks-crack.

[02:40:12.120 --> 02:40:12.400]
Game.

[02:40:12.840 --> 02:40:16.020]
They have up the darkness what a game they played.

[02:40:16.520 --> 02:40:19.500]
And somebody's kid with the hurried gains

[02:40:19.500 --> 02:40:21.380]
to talk about it all the time.

[02:40:21.480 --> 02:40:23.140]
Make you a bag and I'm afraid.

[02:40:23.480 --> 02:40:25.500]
You like yellow-cocks-crack.

[02:40:26.420 --> 02:40:27.140]
Yeah.

[02:40:27.600 --> 02:40:30.380]
Sure thing in burning out morning shows.

[02:40:30.840 --> 02:40:33.420]
No interest in learning how radio.

[02:40:34.180 --> 02:40:37.760]
Just a sausage party for a huge portable host.

[02:40:37.880 --> 02:40:39.760]
Who like yellow-cocks-crack.

[02:40:41.320 --> 02:40:41.720]
You fell.

[02:40:41.900 --> 02:40:43.280]
Yellow-cocks-crack.

[02:40:43.680 --> 02:40:45.060]
Yellow-cocks-crack.

[02:40:45.260 --> 02:40:46.520]
Sword-wholeses tease.

[02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:48.360]
Who all in out?

[02:40:49.020 --> 02:40:50.460]
Yellow-cocks-crack.

[02:40:50.920 --> 02:40:52.280]
Yellow-cocks-crack.

[02:40:52.500 --> 02:40:53.860]
They're on your mind.

[02:40:53.860 --> 02:40:56.160]
To sea in your mouths.

[02:40:56.560 --> 02:40:58.460]
Sports Import Sports Korea share.

[02:40:58.460 --> 02:41:04.440]
