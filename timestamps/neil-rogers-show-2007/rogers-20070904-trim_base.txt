[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.880]
Your guy, that did you see our ratings for the west bo界?

[00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:04.420]
Yeah, I know, he's won't let me.

[00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.760]
Signed with a Bell Sound Small Business Experts.

[00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:09.940]
Bell Sound Small Business will work closely with you to prepare for you.

[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.020]
Don't wait for me, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

[00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:17.720]
If you're good at bellsound.com, so when you're ready to get everything...

[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.840]
I got enough, I gotta think about it, on top of getting right there,

[00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.220]
and I don't need a rating, that's a minus eight.

[00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.960]
Don't care, what you do, long as the sun does snow,

[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.180]
You gotta wait a little harder on the guest you maw.

[00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:31.600]
A rose shit guts to go.

[00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.380]
There's a lot of fat producers here now.

[00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.420]
That's right, watch your back, fat.

[00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.580]
You know when you won't wake them up no more no more no more no more no more.

[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:41.920]
Watch your back, fat.

[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.900]
You know when you won't wake them up no more.

[00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.380]
Oh, gruddle, that blah blah I don't understand.

[00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.540]
But you can eat from a trot while using both dinners.

[00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.200]
Yeah, big fat, fat, you made a rating school.

[00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.260]
You just tight-printed it and it's home.

[00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:57.100]
Oh, you are now.

[00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.000]
And it's straightened your fat ass out.

[00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.620]
Watch your back, fat.

[00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.920]
Watch your back fat.

[00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.660]
And you won't wake them up no more no more what you beg for.

[00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.200]
And you won't wake them up no more.

[00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:19.880]
Watch your back, fat.

[00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.180]
And you won't wake them up no more no more no more no no more no more no more no more what ch''at you that found point from ok

[00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.380]
Oh, no.

[00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:26.140]
Yeah, I can get that.

[00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:27.080]
Yeah, I can get that.

[00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.180]
Yeah, I know.

[00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:28.760]
I know one more time and you're up.

[00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.940]
Oh, you're getting it.

[00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.460]
Yeah, I know.

[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.120]
10.03 at 5.60 WDQ.

[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.460]
I'm happy Tuesday, 4th of September.

[00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:36.780]
Joe Rose is back.

[00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.240]
What does it say on here?

[00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.060]
The New Morning Show.

[00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.780]
Right.

[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.540]
Well, it's supposed to be a big secret, you know?

[00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.400]
And it probably still is, because are they promoting it?

[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.040]
Do we have a bunch of billboards up around town?

[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.380]
Well, they weren't allowed to.

[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.420]
Until I get to do what?

[00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.960]
To talk about him being here.

[00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.820]
Yeah.

[00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.100]
Well, let me ask you the obvious question.

[00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.000]
Then how do they go out?

[00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.040]
They must have been busy yesterday in a holiday.

[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.840]
The sales department.

[00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.620]
Let's hear it for the QM sales department.

[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.100]
Because they went out and sold 8,000 live spots on the Joe Rose and Jason Jackson Show.

[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:10.700]
So the other guys doing live spots too.

[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:11.240]
Are you serious?

[00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.420]
You're pulling my leg about that.

[00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.120]
What do I do that?

[00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.380]
Well, so this is like what killed the first team.

[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:18.160]
Remember that?

[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.800]
Because I heard Joe say this morning, we've got to get out of here for a break,

[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.320]
which you're going to be hearing me say that a lot.

[00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.400]
Now, doesn't this tell you?

[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.260]
Put this all together and what does this tell you?

[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:31.840]
It tells you, well, it tells you a lot of things.

[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.740]
But to me, it tells you that Joe Elfineberg's got to be the worst person

[00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.920]
as Keith Obermann would say, the worst person on the face of the earth.

[00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.580]
Because after Joe got screwed over really badly and lied to and abused

[00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.360]
and treated like garbage and not paid and stuff here,

[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.500]
not once but twice and he still came back.

[00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:50.760]
What does that tell you?

[00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.880]
And now we find out that Zach crans his back.

[00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.440]
That's why I played that in honor of Zach.

[00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.320]
Why didn't you tell me that?

[00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:00.660]
Oh, that's right. We couldn't tell anybody.

[00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.800]
And whose Joe Linder was he really on yesterday?

[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.140]
Is that John Linder?

[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.820]
Yeah, he is.

[00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.740]
Who is he?

[00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:09.040]
This guy.

[00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.620]
Um, these guys, the guy is the guy I love with the ones on the canes.

[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:13.560]
He's what?

[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.860]
He's now the canes reporter.

[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.500]
What does that mean?

[00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:23.740]
He goes out to Hurricane's camp and gets sound and reports on them.

[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.860]
And smells their jock straps and stuff like that?

[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.480]
I don't know. I didn't smell jock stuff last year when he does.

[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:29.760]
Oh, my God.

[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.000]
So he was on yesterday. Well, I sure wish I would have been here to follow that.

[00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.520]
So Joe rose his back on today and a tremendous response.

[00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:38.920]
Look at the way the phones are lighting up.

[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.440]
Oh, thank God. Joe is back.

[00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.240]
This is a good story.

[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.980]
I don't want to sit and read a lot of bedtime stories because we're going to be really phone-intensive from now on.

[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:49.280]
Depending on whether we get any.

[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.300]
What did you do yesterday on Labor Day?

[00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.540]
Whatever.

[00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:53.180]
What's your wax?

[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.500]
You spun some wax?

[00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:57.380]
What is it with that mean?

[00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:58.120]
You played music?

[00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:59.780]
That's right. Thanks again to Rick Shaw.

[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.440]
Who I never realized until last night is the same person who's winked Martin Dale the winker.

[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:05.480]
They're the same person.

[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.420]
I guess Rick doesn't have as many teeth.

[00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.820]
They had the worst show in the history of the biography channel last night.

[00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.160]
Two hours special on game shows.

[00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:17.920]
I thought, boy, this is right off my alley.

[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.280]
So to speak, back then it was going to be really interesting.

[00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:21.320]
And it was not. It sucked.

[00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.760]
But they had a lot of the winker on there.

[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:29.420]
Hey, it's the week Martin Dale and I realized that he and the Ricky Tiki both think they sound the same.

[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.780]
They look the same person, same voice.

[00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.040]
So did you watch Rick over the weekend in the telephone or not?

[00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:36.660]
No.

[00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.480]
No.

[00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.040]
You think anybody did?

[00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.640]
Well, he doesn't.

[00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.340]
He does it for charity is a good guy and we appreciate him coming in last.

[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:44.420]
Always a Thursday?

[00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.340]
Yes.

[00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:46.200]
For a couple of hours.

[00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.660]
Nice to have a couple of people that make commentary about that.

[00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:49.780]
I got an email from the top.

[00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.780]
You're fair.

[00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:51.540]
You did what?

[00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:52.520]
Got some comments.

[00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:53.760]
Not a lot.

[00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.580]
A couple.

[00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:00.940]
Broward Sheriff Ken Jenny in one time the county's most powerful politician has agreed to resign.

[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.460]
And plead guilty to federal corruption charges.

[00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:09.160]
Involving tens of thousands of dollars he allegedly gone from Sheriff's Office contractors and employees.

[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.300]
Sources said today says the hero.

[00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:19.060]
After months of personal language, Jenny decided yesterday to cut a plea deal on tax evasion and other charges to limit his prison time

[00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:25.700]
because he was also a stereo then imminent grand jury in Devon on more serious fraud and money laundering offence his sources be saying.

[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:26.140]
Wow.

[00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:34.080]
The plea agreement means Jenny who earned 170 grand a year a share of will surrender to authorities to face tax evasion charges.

[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.580]
I as early as Wednesday.

[00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:43.280]
The U.S. Attorney's Office plans to file charges plea agreement and proper statement involving the allegations against Jenny today in federal court in for a load of deal.

[00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:51.880]
Jenny will likely serve some prison time possibly between one and two years and have to pay back taxes and fines to the IRS sources said.

[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:58.060]
Jenny, a lawyer who's spent most of his life in public service will also likely lose his Florida bar license and share his pension.

[00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:08.480]
The pension is estimated to be about 125 grand a year. His conviction ends with an amicere of a Democratic politician who had formidable clout from four-large deal to Tallahassee.

[00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:12.880]
A real fascist of the wherever was one couldn't be reached for comment this morning since the herald.

[00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:16.700]
No comment at this time said as attorney David Logan shoots.

[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.820]
We might make a statement later this afternoon depending on the events of the day.

[00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:23.840]
In the plea Jenny is expected to admit to abusing the public trust.

[00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:27.680]
A concession that will hurt his postconviction effort to save his pension.

[00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:33.800]
Had a series of really anxious sheriff's in Robert County member Clay Shaw.

[00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:39.300]
And then there was Nick Navarro.

[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:42.020]
And who might leave it out?

[00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:44.940]
Was there one between Nick Navarro and this fascist bastard?

[00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:45.740]
I don't know.

[00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:46.600]
I forget.

[00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:50.360]
Where is that is it called Navarro?

[00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:50.780]
That thing?

[00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:52.640]
Navarro.

[00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:53.280]
I think it is.

[00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:54.340]
There it is.

[00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:55.060]
There it is.

[00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:55.480]
There it is.

[00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:00.240]
Navarro is a cause of so much grief and sorrow.

[00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:02.280]
He yesterday.

[00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:05.620]
Navarro.

[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:06.840]
Navarro.

[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:07.880]
He's leaving.

[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:11.740]
Navarro but he's just a goosefah.

[00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:15.420]
He's just a goosefah.

[00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:17.760]
A lot of goosefhing in the sheriff's in Robert County.

[00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:20.720]
And this one is a goosefhing tip to the right of the prison.

[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:21.800]
I'll do it very soon.

[00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:23.300]
Bye bye, Ken Jenny.

[00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:24.500]
Good riddance to Mad Rubbish.

[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:28.600]
I give the poll result from yesterday's George Pol on the show but we didn't do one.

[00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:30.440]
Well, because we did some whining.

[00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:33.800]
Which really translate it.

[00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:35.960]
I mean, George played some more of that god awful music again.

[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:36.420]
That's right.

[00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:37.480]
Oh.

[00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:43.500]
Anyway, here's a oligodada tag for a spot on this show.

[00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:44.060]
I'm feeling it.

[00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:45.100]
I did this sales department.

[00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:46.520]
Brian Schmutz especially.

[00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:48.740]
Is this guy doing it or what?

[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:48.980]
Huh?

[00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:50.360]
Is he on top of it?

[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:51.900]
He's on top of something.

[00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:53.540]
Yeah, I'm sure of that.

[00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:54.380]
Wouldn't be the first time.

[00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:58.980]
You heard that story about that arena there in sunrise?

[00:07:59.480 --> 00:07:59.780]
Mm-hmm.

[00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:04.720]
Anyway, we don't want to go into that because we don't want to be smurched the reputation of a fine upstanding

[00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:10.000]
laying down the sales guy Brian Schmutz, who since he's coming back to us has done a hell of a job.

[00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:10.620]
I will.

[00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:12.580]
Have a job.

[00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:12.940]
Not.

[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:17.280]
But now we can sell all those live spots in a morning show.

[00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:21.460]
Would Joe Rose back in Kenny of Bogeyne Schmutz, Jackson, whatever his name is?

[00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:22.380]
Who's your guy's name?

[00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:23.160]
Jason Jackson.

[00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:25.920]
So what's the deal with, I didn't hear it, of course.

[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:27.360]
I should have tuned in Friday morning.

[00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:31.460]
Did you guys hear the ass end of the Kenny and Boe Morning Show the last episode?

[00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:33.060]
Yeah.

[00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:36.040]
And he said goodbye.

[00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:37.800]
And that was it.

[00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:44.260]
There wasn't any cheerful, uh, this has been a real disaster and that was it just a goodbye.

[00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:45.720]
I don't remember anything.

[00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:47.060]
So there was nothing memorable.

[00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:48.060]
I got to say goodbye.

[00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:48.940]
That was it.

[00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:49.780]
Yeah.

[00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:50.700]
Goodbye.

[00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:51.520]
Something like that.

[00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:52.660]
Bye, bye, bye.

[00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:54.120]
Wow.

[00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:56.960]
Come in to QIA and hello.

[00:08:57.460 --> 00:08:58.280]
Hey, how you doing?

[00:08:58.300 --> 00:08:58.700]
Is it Neil?

[00:08:59.060 --> 00:08:59.540]
Okay, sir.

[00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:00.440]
Great.

[00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:05.140]
Anyway, you were trying to find out who you were Sheriff after the borrow.

[00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:05.760]
Yeah.

[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:07.920]
His name was Ron Cockrett.

[00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:10.020]
Right, Ron Cockrett, how could we forget?

[00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:14.300]
Yeah, what happened was that he passed away in 96 and that's right, no way remembered.

[00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:15.340]
That's correct.

[00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:17.500]
When you died, they forget about you fast.

[00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:22.460]
You guys back in the 70s, he was a full, long-cutter, the full, long-cutter, the full, long-cutter,

[00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:23.360]
you know, police department.

[00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:24.300]
Yeah.

[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:26.740]
And that was when Bob Butterworth was Sheriff.

[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:28.120]
Oh, and there's another one.

[00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:29.940]
Bob Butterworth, right, another piece of crap.

[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:31.040]
Okay, thank you so much.

[00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:35.100]
Bob Butterworth went up to Salahassee and they continued to be a piece of crap.

[00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:38.040]
Well, oh, boy, Broward County sure got some really nifty politicians.

[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:39.560]
Not to mention Dave County, too.

[00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:42.360]
Okay, we got a good poll for today.

[00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:46.420]
Which departed QA and Air Personality?

[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:47.600]
Do you miss the most?

[00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:51.820]
And we're not talking about departed like, you know, 100 years ago or 20 years.

[00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:54.600]
We're talking about in recent times.

[00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:57.800]
Is that never we're down enough or not?

[00:09:58.280 --> 00:09:58.420]
Yeah.

[00:09:59.000 --> 00:09:59.520]
I get it.

[00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:02.960]
We got 572 votes, which is a pretty crappy start-up thing to that.

[00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:05.340]
But then again, yesterday was Labor Day, we're after the holiday weekend.

[00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:06.560]
We got no audience left.

[00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:09.140]
But now that Joe Rose is back with Jason Jackson.

[00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:13.860]
And then we get those new rejoins going, boy, that's going to really put us over the top.

[00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:16.380]
Especially that the guy they pulled out of the dumpster, do the new production.

[00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:21.920]
They must have just found out about it like the S-Handel last week that, oh, the oral production,

[00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:25.140]
we can't play it anymore because the contract went out with a guy with a mediocre voice.

[00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:25.920]
We did the old production.

[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:30.000]
And so, don't play it anymore.

[00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:32.200]
Is that the way to win down?

[00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:33.420]
Sounds about right.

[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.820]
Because clearance, you know, he's right on top of stuff.

[00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:38.980]
Which one do you miss the most?

[00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:41.080]
Scott Ferrell, 152 votes.

[00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:43.180]
D-fo 132 now.

[00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:44.760]
Isn't that shocked to live and crap out of you?

[00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:47.000]
Mo Howard, David did it.

[00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:48.600]
Very respectable.

[00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:51.140]
327 right on D-fos ass.

[00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:53.020]
Yolte, 56 votes.

[00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:55.520]
A big drop off from Mo to Yolte, 56.

[00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:58.640]
None of the above is moving up fast, 48th.

[00:10:58.640 --> 00:10:59.340]
That was a late addition.

[00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:01.160]
It's passing to everybody like they're laying down.

[00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:02.540]
The Crow, 32.

[00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:04.000]
Kenny Walker, early 17th.

[00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:06.240]
Hey, Alice, come on back again tomorrow.

[00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:07.060]
Alex, you're great.

[00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:09.040]
And Ron Hershey, only eight.

[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:14.220]
I can imagine he's still standing out there with his thumb out on a Hershey highway.

[00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:17.680]
Does he, he and Sonny Fox still feuding or what?

[00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:18.800]
You know what I don't know.

[00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:19.840]
Well, find out.

[00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:20.380]
No.

[00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:22.440]
The audience likes to hear about crap like that.

[00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:24.720]
They're feuding and fussing and fighting.

[00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:28.080]
1013 at 560 WQM.

[00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:33.220]
We can't have to week more and more people taking advantage of our great half price deals on WQM.com.

[00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:35.180]
And now it's time for another new restaurant offer.

[00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:39.700]
Starting Thursday, you'll be able to buy a $50 Thursday tomorrow today.

[00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:43.320]
Well, are you gonna play a little of that clip later on?

[00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:48.800]
I got the new production guy, he's got the easiest guy I have ever encountered in my life.

[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:49.740]
Anyway, we'll get into that.

[00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:50.540]
Hill Rogers, guys.

[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:52.740]
Good morning, Americans, it's Paul Harvey.

[00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:54.720]
Standby for news.

[00:11:56.060 --> 00:12:04.800]
35 year old Jay Charles Miller has been struggling for years with a minimum wage job.

[00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:12.040]
The toothless factory worker from Muskegee will suffer no more.

[00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:21.040]
The one-eyed man won the power ball, lottery, to the tune of $200 million I'll say it again.

[00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:24.160]
$200 million?

[00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:32.780]
His wife, Velma, wanted to do something nice to show her love, she went to the store

[00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:38.680]
and purchased a pair of crotch-less panties.

[00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:43.080]
When she heard her husband come through the door, she yelled,

[00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:47.000]
come in here, Jay, and get yourself some of this.

[00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:56.080]
When Jay Charles opened the door and saw his wife, spread eagle, on the bed he shouted

[00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:57.000]
in horror.

[00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:02.500]
I don't want any of that, he said, look what it did to your underwear.

[00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:03.800]
Paul Harvey!

[00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:05.980]
Good day.

[00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:06.640]
Good day.

[00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:10.480]
Paul Harvey's birthday today so reports Chris was into such things now.

[00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:12.280]
Not really, someone else told me so.

[00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:16.840]
And he just turned $245, Harvey still kicking ass.

[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.040]
$10,18,560, WDQM, what's that schedule look like today?

[00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:23.080]
Mad Dog at the touchdown club, 2-4.

[00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:28.740]
The power hour, Hank and Mad Dog together, Hank the Humper is back on 5-630 solo and then

[00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:29.480]
we get the Marlon game.

[00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:32.360]
Those are the Marlins at almost 20 games under 500.

[00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:34.520]
More power to you, Joe.

[00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:37.100]
We hope you lose as much money on the Marlins as you did those two years.

[00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:40.020]
You've butchered off the dolphin broadcast and then you got to add to the Marlon

[00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:41.600]
Washington game game, that with Eddie Kay.

[00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:44.440]
There isn't a call on this board.

[00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:47.360]
I thought we were going to be call intensive after a couple of weeks ago.

[00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:48.980]
What do you know?

[00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:55.020]
5-6705-60, wouldn't you think that Joe Rose comes back this morning a total surprise?

[00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:55.600]
Not.

[00:13:56.040 --> 00:14:00.720]
And wouldn't you think that the audience would be or maybe the Kenny Walker fans would be

[00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:06.660]
calling in saying stuff like, oh you didn't support that show Neil, you chased them off

[00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:07.680]
the air Kenny and Bo.

[00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:09.340]
You don't believe you me, I wish I could take that.

[00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:09.860]
You're ready for that.

[00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:10.220]
You're right.

[00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:12.420]
Why don't you take a moment to listen to us?

[00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:16.080]
No, to listen and allow people to air their frustration.

[00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:17.020]
Go ahead.

[00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:20.940]
5-6705-60, is this phone working or are we not doing it?

[00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:22.080]
I guess it's still hooked up.

[00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:24.720]
And pond 560 on the Verizon singular wireless line.

[00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:25.640]
Now what did I say on Thursday?

[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.980]
I said today was going to be brutal because it's the first day, it's like a Monday in an

[00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:34.340]
ordinary week because it's the day after a holiday, a three day holiday weekend.

[00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:35.760]
So it's going to be a poll and team.

[00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:39.280]
I don't notice that Chris is a screening calls anymore.

[00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:40.480]
I did before.

[00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:42.320]
You did before what?

[00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:42.800]
No, you didn't.

[00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:44.020]
The first one I picked up cold.

[00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:45.480]
Yeah, I talked in the next three ones.

[00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:47.260]
Well, you last week you said no more screening.

[00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:49.140]
I didn't say that.

[00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:52.020]
You did well, maybe it was for that day, but yeah, you told me to stop screening.

[00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:56.400]
For the day, you both said, you are the laziest peat.

[00:14:56.460 --> 00:15:00.620]
Now that we got Zach back, you know something, he might pull off a Roger Magdalene George.

[00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:03.100]
Why not Zach producing both shows?

[00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:04.500]
How do you like that?

[00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:05.560]
God, are you lazy?

[00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:07.100]
Somebody QAAM, hello.

[00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:08.460]
Hello?

[00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:09.180]
Yes.

[00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:10.460]
Hey, new job?

[00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:11.480]
Speaking.

[00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:13.320]
New job.

[00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:14.600]
Yes?

[00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:21.820]
You should take all credit for getting those two off the morning and we got a fresh air

[00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:22.200]
door.

[00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:24.760]
Right.

[00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:30.160]
We don't need anyone talking about the schooling power movement anymore.

[00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:31.120]
Thank you.

[00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:32.460]
Okay, thank you.

[00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:34.380]
We don't want to hear about Ethan's school.

[00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:36.420]
In fact, we don't want to hear not just about his Bob movements.

[00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:38.640]
We don't want to hear about the BN that he's spewing on here.

[00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:41.540]
Now Joe said that they had a lot of guests this morning.

[00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:44.400]
Now did you have to catch who they were, Chris, by chance?

[00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:47.360]
I heard Randy Mueller from the dolphin that's all I heard.

[00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:50.000]
Randy Mueller from the dolphins?

[00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:53.020]
Is he related to Randy Moore from the Panthers?

[00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:53.760]
No.

[00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:55.240]
Oh, thank God.

[00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:56.880]
Somebody QAAM, hello.

[00:15:57.920 --> 00:15:58.660]
Oh, yes, hello?

[00:15:59.240 --> 00:15:59.440]
Yes.

[00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:04.020]
I have a life 10-inch North Atlantic squad in my rectum.

[00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:04.740]
Yes.

[00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:08.280]
Congratulations, sir.

[00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:09.260]
You're going to be alive for long.

[00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:10.360]
And have a wonderful lunch.

[00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:14.640]
602 votes on the pool are gold a day of 605.

[00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:17.040]
It's going to be brutal.

[00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:17.680]
I'll tell you that.

[00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:20.560]
See, I can go through a whole thing.

[00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:27.940]
And I probably will about clearance and about Joe Bell, about the evil triumvirate, the three J's, Joyce and Josh and Joe.

[00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:36.540]
What you guys have done here, I'm going to say it again, there are people on death row for much, much lesser offenses than what you people have committed.

[00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:50.260]
But rather than have the decency to like, you know, slink away in the middle of the night and like Ken Jenny in a resign, he did officially resign in 9-18 this morning, by the way, rather than do that, you continue like, you know, pleading ignorance.

[00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:55.020]
Ignorance is bliss, but in their case, there's an exception for you.

[00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:57.240]
These three WQAM, hello.

[00:16:57.940 --> 00:16:58.580]
Tomorrow, Neil.

[00:16:59.000 --> 00:16:59.300]
Yes, sir.

[00:16:59.380 --> 00:16:59.800]
When is this?

[00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:00.780]
How are you doing today?

[00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:01.460]
Okay.

[00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:07.640]
I tuned in to hear Joe Rose this morning, but I guess I caught a tour of the ass then.

[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:08.860]
I could say that.

[00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:13.020]
And all I heard was live spot, eight spots.

[00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:16.260]
All I heard at the end was, well, Neil's next.

[00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:20.320]
It's all I heard of his show, besides spot to spot that spot.

[00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:21.760]
I heard a lot of spots, yeah.

[00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:23.120]
There's no show in the show.

[00:17:24.580 --> 00:17:30.240]
So, you remember, if you've been listening as far back as when the first team was out, when Joe was out with DeFo and Gilded.

[00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:31.280]
Absolutely, absolutely.

[00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:36.580]
And all three of them were doing live spots and Joe was screaming about, oh, these 9-minute breaks and I can't stand this.

[00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:37.760]
And you were actually crazy.

[00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:41.060]
We don't have any show on any numbers because nobody's been listening to that.

[00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:43.580]
In the hour, you had about 15 minutes to show.

[00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:45.740]
At tops, yeah.

[00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:48.000]
Yeah, so there's no show in the show.

[00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:49.500]
So, thanks, Joe.

[00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:55.720]
Yeah, but we got a lot of spots, baby.

[00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:57.520]
We got that money pouring in.

[00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:00.060]
You see, I mean, the catch out of the bag.

[00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:04.240]
In fact, we put that sign up about 9 years ago, or it says, just give us the F and money.

[00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:05.040]
Right.

[00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:06.620]
And that's the model.

[00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:09.240]
That's the Abangio strum and Beasley boys, man.

[00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:10.140]
That's the model.

[00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:11.200]
Just give us the money.

[00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:13.260]
We don't give a crap if we put a good product on the earth.

[00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:17.260]
If anybody's been listening to it, in fact, I don't know why we waste their time going through all that rating nonsense.

[00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:18.600]
What difference does it make?

[00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:23.640]
As long as they can go out there and sell a lot of spots, that's what it's all about.

[00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:25.760]
That's why you can't get any paper clips.

[00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:27.240]
You can't get any like staples.

[00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:31.940]
You can't get any facts paper because under the new regime, it's got nothing to do with radio.

[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:35.820]
And I was telling George before the show today, at least when Greg Reed was there.

[00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:37.940]
And I'm not saying he was a broadcaster because he never will be.

[00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:42.500]
But I was saying, at least during those days, QAM was at least radio-ish.

[00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:44.660]
It wasn't really radio, but it was radio-ish.

[00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:45.440]
Radio-flavored.

[00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:46.860]
Yeah, exactly.

[00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:49.500]
Now, we're not even close to that.

[00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:51.920]
Okay, we're not even close to being radio-ish.

[00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:54.600]
We're just, you know, a whorehouse.

[00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:57.900]
WDQAM, hello.

[00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:01.720]
The only one who has a broadcaster is Jorge, what is my groom?

[00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:05.360]
WDQAM, hello.

[00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:07.760]
Well, yes.

[00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:09.200]
Hey, now, how you doing?

[00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:10.060]
Okay, sir.

[00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:12.920]
Listen, I heard you in the Kenny Walker show the other day.

[00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:14.180]
And?

[00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:15.800]
And he was saying he was temporary.

[00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:17.160]
He knew he was going anyway.

[00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:17.960]
Yeah.

[00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:19.420]
That's what he said.

[00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:23.800]
Maybe that's why he had put all the sports writers on there and put you in the numbers.

[00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:25.360]
Maybe he'd been drove the audience away.

[00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:26.740]
Yeah, that's it.

[00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:30.880]
And as far as Joe Rowe goes, they already ruined it by putting that guy on with him.

[00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:32.720]
What's the guy's name?

[00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:34.000]
Jason Jack.

[00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:35.460]
Jason Jack?

[00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:36.400]
I don't know.

[00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:37.180]
That's a Jack, this.

[00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:38.920]
Yeah, okay, Jack that.

[00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:40.480]
Jack Daniels.

[00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:42.120]
612 votes on the pool.

[00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:45.420]
I noticed that, well, you know, it's this the first day of the two of them work together.

[00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:46.960]
I thought they worked together across the street.

[00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:49.720]
I think this is the first time they're on the show together, yes.

[00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:50.060]
Oh.

[00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:53.660]
Because I noticed it, whatever the guy's name is, he kept stepping on Joe.

[00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:57.300]
I didn't hear an awful lot of it because every time I punched the button up to listen,

[00:19:57.700 --> 00:19:59.980]
they were going into another long, long commercial.

[00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:01.500]
And I kept thinking, where is Joe?

[00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:02.820]
Where's the little dog, you know?

[00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:07.900]
And then when he would start talking, the other guy, like stepping all over him,

[00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:11.020]
which I thought was, I don't know what I would do with the other guy.

[00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:12.240]
I don't the bitch right now.

[00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:13.000]
That's what I'm thinking.

[00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:14.520]
But what do I know?

[00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:16.560]
612 votes on the pool.

[00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:17.560]
Who do you miss the most?

[00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:19.900]
Scott Farrell, 166.

[00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:22.180]
D-4136.

[00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:23.520]
Mohauer, David, in 132.

[00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:24.760]
D-2, D-2.

[00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:24.960]
D-2.

[00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:25.200]

[00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:25.300]

[00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:25.300]

[00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:25.320]

[00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:25.320]

[00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:25.500]
D-2.

[00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:25.500]

[00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:25.560]

[00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:25.600]
D-2.

[00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:25.760]
D-2.

[00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:25.840]
D-2.

[00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:25.840]

[00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:26.100]
D-2.

[00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:26.100]

[00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:26.100]

[00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:26.220]
D-2.

[00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:26.340]
D-2.

[00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:27.340]
D-2.

[00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:28.060]
What do you think about that?

[00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:28.060]

[00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:28.960]
It's still making a big move.

[00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:29.460]

[00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:31.340]
Gildi, only 59.

[00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:34.180]
More power to you, Joel.

[00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:35.520]
You and Gildi have a good time.

[00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:37.280]
The Crow 32.

[00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:39.760]
Kenny Walker, Solomon Tade, D-8, C-17.

[00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:42.780]
And Ron Hersey, only 8.

[00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:44.440]
Remember those glory days?

[00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:48.480]
Those awful macaroni salad days with Ron Hersey and Carolyn.

[00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:48.840]
And that.

[00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:49.740]
Yeah, that.

[00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:51.140]
And that.

[00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:55.820]
I think that's what we stop being radio-ish.

[00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:57.720]
The big, the old.

[00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:03.020]
Yeah, that morning, Americans, it's Paul Harvey, standby for news.

[00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:08.940]
Abigail McGillin, an elderly woman, answered a knock at the door one day, only to be confronted

[00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:12.040]
by a well-dressed young man carrying a vacuum cleaner.

[00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:12.940]
I'll say it again.

[00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:16.360]
The young man was carrying a vacuum cleaner.

[00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:18.280]
Good morning, said the man.

[00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:21.980]
If I could take a couple of moments of your time, I'd like to demonstrate to very latest

[00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:24.200]
and high-powered vacuum cleaners.

[00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:25.720]
Go away, said Abigail.

[00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:27.080]
I haven't gotten any money.

[00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:29.080]
And she proceeded to close the door.

[00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:32.980]
Quick as a flash, the young man wedged his foot in the door and pushed it wide open.

[00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:35.960]
Don't be too hasty, he said to Abigail.

[00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:39.020]
Not until you have at least seen my demonstration.

[00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:43.920]
With that, he emptied a bucket of horse manure onto her hallway carpet.

[00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:50.360]
If this vacuum cleaner does not remove all traces of horse manure from your carpet matum,

[00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:52.320]
I will personally eat.

[00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:53.600]
The remainder.

[00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:58.380]
Abigail stepped back and chuckled and said, well, I hope you got a damn good appetite because

[00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:00.620]
they cut off my electricity this morning.

[00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:01.640]
Paul Harvey.

[00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:03.400]
Yes, they?

[00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:05.600]
It's sent 32, happy birthday, Paul.

[00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:07.360]
Happy 425th birthday, man.

[00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:09.360]
He's still the one to show in his basement.

[00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:11.940]
In Chicago, aren't you impressed by that?

[00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:12.240]
No.

[00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:16.100]
Now, I'm a little bit confused because you guys about all the new production.

[00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:19.320]
How come we listened to John Fescent a junior, the adductor and imposter there?

[00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:21.540]
How come we listened to that again on the rejoin?

[00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:23.900]
Because those are the only rejoiners we have to play.

[00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:25.980]
We're allowed to play that the big voice.

[00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:27.380]
We can't play the other one.

[00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:29.880]
Well, I don't understand, but you've got the other one.

[00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:30.860]
You've got the new guy.

[00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:33.140]
A rejoiner, no.

[00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:37.480]
Well, what does that mean?

[00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:43.040]
The new guy gave us exits, I believe, and then you're open.

[00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:44.620]
WDQIM, hello.

[00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:45.240]
Bill.

[00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:46.100]
Yes, sir.

[00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:46.520]
Good morning.

[00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:47.600]
When is theus?

[00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:50.740]
Just wanted to let you know that the, uh, now it's that's up.

[00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:52.440]
Right, that's okay.

[00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:54.060]
Oh, here's the idiot again.

[00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:54.680]
The SMP.

[00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:56.500]
The new economy, which is the Navy on.

[00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:57.760]
Yeah, I'm a little bit confused.

[00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:00.000]
Yeah, I'm a little bit confused.

[00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:00.440]
Yeah, good.

[00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:01.200]
Have a good time with it.

[00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:02.780]
Go play in the street.

[00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:06.260]
Go play in the, uh, Enselford Express Wendy Troyd.

[00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:08.760]
632 votes on the poll.

[00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:09.820]
There's not a call on the board.

[00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:13.140]
If we don't get these phones going again, I'm going to go back starting Thursday.

[00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:16.360]
And of course, next week, it's back to full time, boy.

[00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:17.140]
The party's over.

[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:18.100]
All right.

[00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:22.040]
And so I have to decide today and Thursday what I'm going to be doing starting next Monday,

[00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:25.920]
every day, five days a week for the next 16 months, and then it's goodbye.

[00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:27.720]
I've got to have to decide about that.

[00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:33.240]
And based on what I'm seeing here so far, uh, not to encouraging.

[00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:37.040]
And especially on the day when we get all the excitement of your rows coming back,

[00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:41.780]
and Kenny and Bowie finally get rid of the, uh, I mean, that was like following a train wreck following that show.

[00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:45.840]
But this is like what they've done.

[00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:46.860]
It seems to me.

[00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:48.640]
And I don't want to judge just in one day.

[00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:52.820]
But it seems to me it's the typical Joe Bell clearance way and that is take something good

[00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:55.940]
and do everything possible to make sure that it fails.

[00:23:57.640 --> 00:23:59.460]
Loaded up with 80 billion spots.

[00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:01.240]
So basically, there was any show.

[00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:03.480]
Am I right?

[00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:05.100]
I mean, wouldn't be the first time they've done that.

[00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:05.580]
Nope.

[00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:08.520]
Let's make sure that it fails.

[00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:10.440]
That's the QA model now.

[00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:12.060]
And believe me, we're doing a great job of that.

[00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:13.680]
Nice going, Joe.

[00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:15.080]
I'm not talking about Joe Rosem.

[00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:15.780]
I'm talking about Jolly.

[00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:16.920]
Fat ass Jolly, Joe Bell.

[00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:18.060]
I should separate that.

[00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:19.040]
Joe Rosem is a great guy.

[00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:19.940]
A good broadcaster.

[00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:22.100]
And we're ecstatic to have him back.

[00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:23.880]
It would be just nice if they let him do a show.

[00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:25.880]
I think would be a good idea.

[00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:28.020]
Now why do you have line line hold?

[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.100]
So that they'll stay on stop calling each time?

[00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:32.620]
Huh!

[00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:34.620]
Oh, do you mean that?

[00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:35.980]
Nobody QA and ho?

[00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:37.160]
Anya?

[00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:37.940]
Yes, sir.

[00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:40.180]
They ruined another show, buddy.

[00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:41.460]
What do you mean by that?

[00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:42.960]
They did it again.

[00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:43.620]
Yeah.

[00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:46.520]
What to do with Jason Jackson on the show?

[00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:48.780]
Is he back?

[00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:50.440]
He was terrible on the other show.

[00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:52.680]
Now let me ask you, how many nights in a row of your slept

[00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:53.360]
would sit the kid?

[00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:54.940]
Sit the kid?

[00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:55.720]
Yeah.

[00:24:56.020 --> 00:24:57.240]
That's your boyfriend, not mine.

[00:24:57.560 --> 00:24:57.980]
No, okay.

[00:24:58.620 --> 00:24:59.600]
Hey, that was the right answer.

[00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:03.080]
56670560, pound 560.

[00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:05.360]
You know, if you got something, let's hear it.

[00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:05.960]
I'm serious.

[00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:08.080]
This is the week for today and Thursday for me.

[00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:11.340]
And of course, George, the rest of the week, he's cranking out some, what do you call it?

[00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:13.020]
Oh, I spun some wax.

[00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:15.020]
So that's just a spun some wax.

[00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:16.020]
A holiday show.

[00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:19.280]
Just because Rick Shaw was on last week, we don't have to get too waxy, do we?

[00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:20.520]
Spun some wax.

[00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:21.560]
Never beat too wet.

[00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:22.960]
Now do we have a Marlingine Esteele 1232?

[00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:25.340]
Yeah, we have to bellyig that much.

[00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:27.180]
WDQYN, hello.

[00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:31.380]
The stench of Kalman or harbors over that performance by Michigan?

[00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:34.580]
Oh, yeah, Appalachian State, a little girl school.

[00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:37.180]
A deaf dumb and blind little girl school and they got beat.

[00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:37.680]
Who cares?

[00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:40.300]
Call up mad dog and chew his ass out, okay?

[00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:43.580]
Talk about embarrassing and humiliating and degrading.

[00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:48.400]
And we like losing to a Sandler American Legion team of 10 year old kids.

[00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:51.360]
But nevertheless, WDQYN, hello.

[00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:52.680]
Meal guy.

[00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:53.500]
Yes, sir.

[00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:56.740]
Hey, I put the suds on with Joe Rose in the morning.

[00:25:57.260 --> 00:26:01.440]
I heard him on the George couple of weeks ago and he did a great job.

[00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:02.680]

[00:34:04.420 --> 00:34:16.880]

[00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:21.460]
student displayed a Bong hits for Jesus sign at an event outside his high school and

[00:34:21.460 --> 00:34:24.420]
Steven's wrote the descent for the four justices who believe the student's

[00:34:24.420 --> 00:34:29.320]
free right speech should be protected. Today the actions of literally millions of

[00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:32.560]
otherwise law-abiding users of marijuana and of the majority of voters in each

[00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:35.980]
of the several states that tolerate medicinal uses of the product lead me to

[00:34:35.980 --> 00:34:39.080]
wonder whether the fear of disapproval by those in the majority and

[00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:43.920]
silencing opponents of the Warren drugs Steven's wrote. Most debate over the

[00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:47.020]
efficacy of the one drug focuses on government crackdowns and uses of

[00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:50.800]
medical marijuana for drug use of chronic pain but in comparing pot smoking to

[00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:56.740]
social drinking Steven suggests the drug could be legalized in all cases. He insists

[00:34:56.740 --> 00:35:00.260]
no one seriously maintains the drug advocate because he can be prohibited because

[00:35:00.260 --> 00:35:03.800]
of its feared consequences later he observed the shift in American views on

[00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:08.560]
booze since the 20s and 30s. While alcoholic beverages are now regarded as

[00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:12.160]
ordinary articles of commerce their use was then condemned with the same moral

[00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:15.460]
further that now supports the Ryan drugs Steven's rights. How do you like that

[00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:19.680]
for an old cool 87 huh you go. He's probably smoking a big fat one right now we can

[00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:20.120]
only hope.

[00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:25.480]
Hello hello.

[00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:26.060]

[00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:33.820]

[00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:37.260]

[00:35:38.420 --> 00:35:38.900]
WQ.

[00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:40.380]

[00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:41.440]
Hello.

[00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:41.460]
No.

[00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:42.540]
Yes sir.

[00:35:43.060 --> 00:35:43.620]
I was going buddy.

[00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:44.560]
Okay pal.

[00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:46.380]
Hey I grew up.

[00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:52.500]

I'm talking TV broadcast.

[00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:55.900]
Do you see him Thursday night?

[00:35:56.180 --> 00:35:56.960]
No I do not.

[00:35:57.200 --> 00:35:57.320]
No.

[00:35:57.560 --> 00:35:58.080]
Oh God.

[00:35:58.340 --> 00:35:59.500]
He got you got a hangover.

[00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:00.200]
It was big.

[00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:01.940]
This guy's bigger than an epiponymous.

[00:36:03.220 --> 00:36:04.320]
But I don't know.

[00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:06.580]
By the way my countdown is on.

[00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:08.420]
I've only got six days ago.

[00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:09.920]
I'm named the last biggest.

[00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:12.040]
This is the quarter slack guy.

[00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:12.660]
I'm going to hit it.

[00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:13.080]
Oh.

[00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:14.760]
Oh.

[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:16.360]
Oh.

[00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:17.340]
Come on down.

[00:36:17.620 --> 00:36:17.820]
Come down.

[00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:18.900]
Oh.

[00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:19.540]
Come down.

[00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:23.120]
So what do we got?

[00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:27.460]
We got the quarter slack guy and we got the the S&P is up again. We we had like 10 calls.

[00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:30.840]
We're going to just like the sports shows now. It all evens out. Only these are different

[00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:31.160]
ones.

[00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:31.460]
You know.

[00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:33.240]
They got the guy.

[00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:35.020]
Oh the orange bull was great.

[00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:35.980]
And I'm so upset.

[00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:39.660]
And I like the smell of the urinals and all that. You know P and stuff.

[00:36:42.740 --> 00:36:43.780]
That's the sports guys.

[00:36:43.940 --> 00:36:48.020]
But we got the S&P guy and now we got the quarter slack guy. We're setting the Vegas.

[00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:48.580]
Go ahead.

[00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:49.420]
Just stay there pal.

[00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:50.500]
Stay there.

[00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:52.180]
Take a roll of nickels and have a good time.

[00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:58.700]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 in the Verizon singular wireless line.

[00:36:58.700 --> 00:37:00.000]
The quarter slack guy.

[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:00.740]
My ass.

[00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:00.920]
Right.

[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:01.220]
Don't.

[00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:01.600]
Jesus.

[00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:02.120]
God.

[00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:03.620]
Have any QAN?

[00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:03.840]
Hello.

[00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:04.300]
Yeah.

[00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:05.680]
Can we talk about something serious? Please.

[00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:06.220]
Go ahead.

[00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:07.360]
A couple of things.

[00:37:07.540 --> 00:37:11.860]
First of all, you know how bad the real estate market is in Florida at this point.

[00:37:12.980 --> 00:37:14.140]
So what are we going to do?

[00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:15.860]
You see, did you see Mr.

[00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:17.560]
This sounds like the S&P guy again.

[00:37:17.620 --> 00:37:18.260]
No, no, it's not.

[00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:20.560]
But did you see Mr.

[00:37:21.380 --> 00:37:28.680]
Our great president, Bubba, talking about the double, the come double about how the market

[00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:33.740]
is down and we have to we all these people got in the very bad loans and we don't know what to do.

[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:34.940]
Yeah, we're going to be up on that.

[00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:42.380]
But I mean, really, it's like 40% of the homes in South Florida at this point are close to four closer.

[00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:42.980]
Yeah.

[00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:45.320]
Could you imagine one storm coming through?

[00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:47.360]
One storm.

[00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:49.440]
Everybody will just walk away and that'll be it.

[00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:50.520]
Like New Orleans.

[00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:54.220]
So it's so it and yeah, it got to be a step up for most people.

[00:37:54.220 --> 00:37:54.640]
I would think.

[00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:58.020]
Yeah, but I mean, on serious note, though, it's

[00:37:58.020 --> 00:38:05.400]
It's very bad here because there were so many people who got such bad loans and I just I can't even imagine what.

[00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:07.240]
What's going to happen in there?

[00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:08.040]
Money in there is your money, sir.

[00:38:08.140 --> 00:38:08.780]
That's my suggestion.

[00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:10.580]
Here comes the money and there goes your money.

[00:38:10.620 --> 00:38:11.400]
There goes your money.

[00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:12.600]
Just remember what I said.

[00:38:12.740 --> 00:38:13.540]
The S&P is up.

[00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:15.200]
560.

[00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:16.140]
560.

[00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:17.120]
560.

[00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:19.280]
And let's put some lipstick on this pig, baby.

[00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:20.220]
All right.

[00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:23.800]
That's the new economy against the old economy.

[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.660]
I'm suggesting right now if you got a few nickels, put them under the mattress.

[00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:27.100]
Okay.

[00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:32.880]
Call up dial amateurs by you and I's new mattress and put them on the under the mattress and keep it there.

[00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:37.300]
All these snake oil salesmen on there, Jim Kramer and all these other guys.

[00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:39.460]
They're all crazy people.

[00:38:40.220 --> 00:38:40.940]
They're all nuts.

[00:38:42.660 --> 00:38:44.120]
But you have a good time with it though.

[00:38:44.180 --> 00:38:48.520]
It's like and by the way, I've given up woodbuying for the 400 time.

[00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:49.100]
It's all right.

[00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:55.120]
I won three grand on Friday and Sunday morning I went back and gave it back and I got an email from some guy sports.

[00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:56.820]
Oh, whatever this guy is.

[00:38:56.880 --> 00:39:00.760]
Who gives me a solid of dance about the day that I won 800 and I ran out with these.

[00:39:00.860 --> 00:39:02.840]
That's the first side of a gambling problem.

[00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:08.640]
I think I might just schmit can that whole my space thing.

[00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:10.460]
Okay.

[00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:10.860]
Again.

[00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:14.380]
I'm just tired of people telling me how to live my life.

[00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:15.820]
You know, I mean, I have a person.

[00:39:15.860 --> 00:39:16.660]
What do you know about it?

[00:39:16.820 --> 00:39:18.120]
I have personal friends on there that I've talked to.

[00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:19.180]
Since you were born yesterday.

[00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:22.080]
I appreciate their advice and things like that and we give it a vice back and forth.

[00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:24.680]
But I'm talking about stranger, a stranger.

[00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:29.200]
And he's giving me a solid of dance about when you're ahead and you run out the door with their money.

[00:39:29.260 --> 00:39:31.120]
That's the first side of a gambling problem.

[00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:35.280]
When you stay there and you give it back, that's the sign of a gambling problem.

[00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:35.660]
That's right.

[00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:37.200]
You don't know when to stop.

[00:39:37.340 --> 00:39:38.400]
Probably the core of Slop guy.

[00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:40.880]
W.Q.A.M. Hello.

[00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:43.960]
How old do you keep the microphone out of his mouth?

[00:39:44.220 --> 00:39:46.140]
It's not a damn W.Q.A.M. Hello.

[00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:49.360]
It's a former equal you, idiot.

[00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:51.360]
W.Q.A.M. Hello.

[00:39:51.820 --> 00:39:52.180]
Okay.

[00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:57.160]
Like I said, starting next week when we go back to full time, I'm going to call Zethnaker finished.

[00:39:58.040 --> 00:39:59.140]
Wouldn't you think that's a good idea?

[00:39:59.260 --> 00:39:59.900]
Well, I know you do.

[00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:01.560]
Yeah, well, whatever.

[00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:02.240]
It's all good.

[00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:04.040]
Well, what does that mean?

[00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:06.800]
Has there been any...

[00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:12.420]
Tell me right now, has there been anybody here this morning so far in the first hour who sent anything to say about anything?

[00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:13.840]
How much time are you going to give me to answer?

[00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:15.320]
How much is you need?

[00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:16.720]
No, of course.

[00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:19.720]
Our next 25-lantilla, Chris starts doing a live spot.

[00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:21.800]
It's always pan and foregold.

[00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:24.600]
Six hundred eighty-eight votes on the pool.

[00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:26.100]
We got that maybe eight hundred today.

[00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:27.100]
Well, whatever we get we get.

[00:40:27.180 --> 00:40:28.140]
You know, stay after Labor Day.

[00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:28.600]
What do you want?

[00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:32.080]
W.Q.A.M. Hello.

[00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:33.340]
Hi, Neil.

[00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:34.220]
Yes, sir.

[00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:44.100]
I was trying to get a hold of you last week, but over at the Pompa No Harness track, they had a deal where if you go over there and you spend a hundred dollars, you get a hundred dollars back.

[00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:45.420]
You heard anything about that?

[00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:46.020]
No.

[00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:48.820]
Well, I got sixty-five back.

[00:40:49.020 --> 00:40:49.820]
They screwed me.

[00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:52.220]
But what does that mean?

[00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:55.180]
If you spend a hundred dollars, you get a hundred back?

[00:40:55.700 --> 00:40:57.340]
Yes, they give you a hundred dollars back.

[00:40:57.760 --> 00:41:04.340]
The next following day, if you come back with your card, you know, so that what you're standing there.

[00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:07.860]
And I ended up only getting sixty-five.

[00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:10.540]
They said I didn't push my card in far enough.

[00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:12.380]
So they made thirty-five?

[00:41:12.380 --> 00:41:16.120]
Well, I'll tell you what, bend over again and let's see if they can stick it in far enough this time.

[00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:17.860]
This is the Neil Roger Show.

[00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:18.900]
It's a forfeit.

[00:41:19.620 --> 00:41:20.680]
This is your blame.

[00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:21.620]
Who does that?

[00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:23.620]
Any questions?

[00:41:26.980 --> 00:41:27.480]
Oi!

[00:41:28.020 --> 00:41:31.300]
So nothing shampoo and coffee and water.

[00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:34.860]
Shell candles and TV rings for your daughter.

[00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:38.460]
Don't have that duty-free case of champagne.

[00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:42.280]
These are the things you can take on a plane.

[00:41:44.060 --> 00:41:49.300]
And she's with an hair gel and lip balm and toothpaste on clear silk.

[00:41:49.660 --> 00:41:52.020]
For all of those, it's on your face.

[00:41:52.380 --> 00:41:55.580]
You have that sunburn but no solar clean.

[00:41:55.940 --> 00:41:59.500]
That's one more thing you can take on a plane.

[00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:06.560]
And the airport you'll be waiting if this thing was saved.

[00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:15.760]
And while they make you throw out all of those things, you cannot take on a plane.

[00:42:16.820 --> 00:42:21.380]
It's 11-1-1-5-6 with WDQM Happy Tuesday, 4th of September, baby day after.

[00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:24.900]
This is the beginning of, you know, the end as far as the summer is all over.

[00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:28.380]
The picnic's over and of course Georgia is a smile from the air.

[00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:32.560]
I might just call in sickness week, surprise the hell out of you.

[00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:34.180]
That would surprise the hell out of you.

[00:42:34.420 --> 00:42:35.480]
Yes, WDQM, hello.

[00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:36.820]
Hey, I'm in.

[00:42:36.980 --> 00:42:39.820]
This is Jordan and I've got a couple questions for you about today's baseball.

[00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:41.280]
About what?

[00:42:41.420 --> 00:42:41.420]

[00:42:41.420 --> 00:42:41.760]
About what?

[00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:42.060]
About what?

[00:42:42.220 --> 00:42:43.400]
About what?

[00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:45.040]
About what are you talking about?

[00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:46.900]
What are you talking about?

[00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:48.100]
You crazy person.

[00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:49.060]
But what about you?

[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:50.440]
That's it.

[00:42:50.540 --> 00:42:51.240]
That's our calls.

[00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:54.180]
I might just have to play some wax today, you know what?

[00:42:54.180 --> 00:42:55.140]
Spend some wax?

[00:42:55.260 --> 00:42:55.500]
Right on.

[00:42:57.060 --> 00:42:58.060]
702 votes on the pool.

[00:42:58.220 --> 00:43:00.060]
That was at 566-705-60.

[00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:01.960]
Last call for callers today.

[00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:06.100]
Just the usual bunch of goofballs and that's pretty much it.

[00:43:07.180 --> 00:43:11.700]
We got the debut of the new Joe Roe show along with the whatever that guy's name is Jason Jackson.

[00:43:13.820 --> 00:43:16.500]
And the audience seems to be like, you know, non-plus.

[00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:20.080]
Of course, a big part of our audience doesn't listen to the sports shows, which is a bad mistake.

[00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:24.080]
Because you've been learning a lot about guys that wear jocks for action, take showers together, make it.

[00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:26.260]
702 votes on the pool.

[00:43:26.620 --> 00:43:29.260]
Which department of QA personality you miss the most?

[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:30.680]
Scott Farrell.

[00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:32.000]
182.

[00:43:34.060 --> 00:43:34.940]
D4-153.

[00:43:35.260 --> 00:43:37.680]
Now that's just, I don't get that.

[00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:39.340]
For life of me.

[00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:43.920]
I also don't get why goofball, they don't answer the phone.

[00:43:45.460 --> 00:43:46.700]
566-705-60.

[00:43:46.900 --> 00:43:48.040]
Very slow on that phone there.

[00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:49.660]
Chris, of course, fat people talk about it.

[00:43:49.660 --> 00:43:50.880]
So I was answering this first one.

[00:43:51.340 --> 00:43:52.080]
Yeah, I see.

[00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:53.420]
Really slow.

[00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:54.720]
I wouldn't want to either.

[00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:56.240]
Hahaha.

[00:43:58.300 --> 00:43:59.260]
D4-153.

[00:43:59.420 --> 00:44:00.940]
Mojauer, David in 143.

[00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:02.400]
We got a nice three-way race going there.

[00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:04.960]
None of the above though is making big strides.

[00:44:05.380 --> 00:44:05.840]
93.

[00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:08.080]
Jellie 65.

[00:44:08.340 --> 00:44:09.200]
The Crow 41.

[00:44:09.660 --> 00:44:11.120]
Kenny Walker, only 17.

[00:44:12.100 --> 00:44:13.840]
And Ron Hershey 8 out of 705.

[00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:16.180]
That Kenny Walker thing.

[00:44:16.180 --> 00:44:19.380]
I see you were narrowed it's just like business, not personal.

[00:44:19.460 --> 00:44:23.240]
But in the case of him and at the, what, that abortion they put on for how long were they on?

[00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:24.160]
Year and a half.

[00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:24.680]
A year I think.

[00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:25.480]
A year?

[00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:27.180]
I took that personal.

[00:44:28.120 --> 00:44:29.960]
I mean, he just butchered.

[00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:31.780]
And, and what, what was his excuse?

[00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:37.160]
I guess the excuse being a clearance kept forcing him to put all these other stiffs on the ear.

[00:44:37.420 --> 00:44:38.520]
But I mean, good God.

[00:44:38.820 --> 00:44:39.640]
I mean, it's not, I warned him.

[00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:40.440]
They wouldn't listen to me.

[00:44:40.540 --> 00:44:41.840]
It's not like he wasn't a broadcast.

[00:44:42.060 --> 00:44:45.820]
I remember those days back in the beginning about telling him that they were doomed to fail.

[00:44:45.820 --> 00:44:47.360]
They don't let them ding dong you to death.

[00:44:47.560 --> 00:44:47.620]
Don't throw.

[00:44:47.620 --> 00:44:48.020]
That's right.

[00:44:48.140 --> 00:44:49.100]
They ding dong them to death.

[00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:50.020]
All the way to the brain.

[00:44:50.380 --> 00:44:51.540]
They're not talking enough about sports.

[00:44:51.580 --> 00:44:52.840]
They don't have the sports writers on them.

[00:44:52.840 --> 00:44:54.460]
You know what you need to do with them.

[00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:55.040]
No, no.

[00:44:57.120 --> 00:44:57.820]
WQA and Hello.

[00:44:58.340 --> 00:44:59.180]
Hey, Neil, how you doing?

[00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:00.020]
Okay, sir.

[00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:05.000]
I started talking to the show because I forgot that, you know, you put a, put us on hold a little bit.

[00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:07.480]
I started, then you would talk about something else.

[00:45:07.840 --> 00:45:08.740]
You put me on hold there.

[00:45:09.260 --> 00:45:09.500]
Yeah.

[00:45:10.060 --> 00:45:10.600]
All right.

[00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:11.400]
Listen up.

[00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:15.700]
I have found crack cocaine in the public's ice container.

[00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:21.060]
In the refrigerator, your public's sticky buns ice cream.

[00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:24.060]
It'll kill you, but it's the greatest thing in earth.

[00:45:25.380 --> 00:45:26.240]
Stay away from it, man.

[00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:26.920]
Okay.

[00:45:28.520 --> 00:45:29.580]
Stay away from it.

[00:45:29.820 --> 00:45:30.640]
Hi, ice cream yesterday.

[00:45:30.700 --> 00:45:31.800]
Bad mistake, by the way.

[00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:34.080]
My blood sugar was extremely high.

[00:45:34.860 --> 00:45:35.960]
And that's number one.

[00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:37.180]
And number two, it was crap.

[00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:41.380]
The people of Wattau have been in theories that there's a special place reserved in the

[00:45:41.380 --> 00:45:42.100]
kitchen, and they've been in hell for them.

[00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:44.720]
The new flavor, it's called strawberry cheesecake.

[00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:45.520]
Have you ever had that?

[00:45:46.280 --> 00:45:47.460]
Uh, no.

[00:45:47.820 --> 00:45:48.260]
It's crap.

[00:45:49.100 --> 00:45:50.200]
Okay, thanks for the warning.

[00:45:50.340 --> 00:45:50.840]
It's crap.

[00:45:51.660 --> 00:45:53.100]
All of our new flavors are crap.

[00:45:53.360 --> 00:45:56.520]
You read the ingredients on the label and it sounds, mmm, this is going to be really good.

[00:45:56.740 --> 00:45:57.420]
It's crap.

[00:45:58.940 --> 00:46:00.440]
I mean, they used to be so dependable.

[00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:03.420]
Every time they'd come up with something new, you knew it was going to be really great.

[00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:03.920]
Am I right?

[00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:05.180]
Yeah, you're right.

[00:46:05.460 --> 00:46:05.840]
That's right.

[00:46:06.180 --> 00:46:08.020]
I remember they sold out in the corporate.

[00:46:08.220 --> 00:46:08.360]
Right.

[00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:10.360]
So they don't have any imagination.

[00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:11.100]
I can't hear you, I'm sure.

[00:46:11.100 --> 00:46:11.520]
That's correct.

[00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:13.500]
Soots don't know jack about squat.

[00:46:14.940 --> 00:46:15.860]
They're squatting, no.

[00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:17.820]
In fact, if you'd never be, you'll be squatting too.

[00:46:18.200 --> 00:46:18.660]
Worked for me.

[00:46:19.180 --> 00:46:20.080]
Wattau, QA and hello.

[00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:21.260]
I'm for now.

[00:46:21.780 --> 00:46:22.120]
Yes sir.

[00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:23.100]
We have got a label.

[00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:23.800]
It's Gale.

[00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:25.740]
It's crap.

[00:46:26.180 --> 00:46:26.900]
It's butter and gale.

[00:46:27.340 --> 00:46:27.920]
How you doing buddy?

[00:46:28.420 --> 00:46:28.660]
Okay.

[00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:31.340]
Listen, listen.

[00:46:31.640 --> 00:46:32.800]
Are you calling me before right?

[00:46:33.380 --> 00:46:33.740]
Yeah.

[00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:37.480]
Now why do you have the radio on in the back so everybody can hear it and drive everybody nuts?

[00:46:37.480 --> 00:46:38.640]
Oh, I'm sorry.

[00:46:38.780 --> 00:46:39.060]
I'm sorry.

[00:46:39.060 --> 00:46:40.860]
You want to be sorry, Stuttering Gale.

[00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:44.400]
Yeah, I just got out of Key West.

[00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:47.040]
I ain't ever going down to Key West again.

[00:46:47.560 --> 00:46:48.660]
Somebody's not going to rape me.

[00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:50.800]
They put a drug in my drink.

[00:46:51.220 --> 00:46:51.820]
Okay, good.

[00:46:53.420 --> 00:46:53.420]

[00:46:56.640 --> 00:46:57.080]
W-

[00:46:57.080 --> 00:46:57.080]

[00:46:57.080 --> 00:46:57.320]
W-

[00:46:57.320 --> 00:46:57.980]
QA and hello.

[00:46:58.820 --> 00:47:01.080]
Neil, how you doing today is the Matt Perrier.

[00:47:01.260 --> 00:47:03.680]
I see the people spoken brow with 10 Jennings.

[00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:05.580]
I thought you last week is time to move.

[00:47:08.020 --> 00:47:08.460]
Jennings.

[00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:09.320]
Jennings.

[00:47:09.660 --> 00:47:10.140]
The sheriff.

[00:47:10.740 --> 00:47:11.040]
Jenny?

[00:47:11.480 --> 00:47:12.860]
Time that we get Don Timothy.

[00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:13.740]
Okay.

[00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:14.300]
Great.

[00:47:14.420 --> 00:47:15.540]
There's the John Timothy guy too.

[00:47:15.620 --> 00:47:16.080]
That's your one.

[00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:17.760]
He's on the case.

[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:19.520]
The private self-appointed P.I.

[00:47:19.860 --> 00:47:21.140]
You got the quarter slot guy.

[00:47:21.580 --> 00:47:23.180]
The self-appointed John Timothy P.I.

[00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:24.960]
Who's going to the card dealer to check it all out.

[00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:26.880]
And then you got the, uh, who's the other one?

[00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:28.300]
The S&P is up guy.

[00:47:28.860 --> 00:47:29.700]
And that's it.

[00:47:33.180 --> 00:47:33.980]
WQA and hello.

[00:47:34.420 --> 00:47:35.560]
It puts your left foot in the back.

[00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:38.160]
WQA and hello.

[00:47:38.360 --> 00:47:39.000]
Oh, Bob.

[00:47:39.660 --> 00:47:40.460]
Oh, Bob.

[00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:42.540]
WQA and hello.

[00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:43.760]
Neil, what's up?

[00:47:44.140 --> 00:47:44.700]
Yes, sir.

[00:47:45.140 --> 00:47:46.880]
Neil, are you going to start about the street?

[00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:48.960]
They started arriving with telecom with them.

[00:47:49.160 --> 00:47:49.980]
Just a Donald.

[00:47:50.140 --> 00:47:50.960]
Come on, man.

[00:47:50.980 --> 00:47:52.960]
And I don't know for knew with that.

[00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:53.680]
Sir, what?

[00:47:53.900 --> 00:47:54.140]
What?

[00:47:54.380 --> 00:47:54.460]
What?

[00:47:54.780 --> 00:47:57.260]
Tell me one word you just said.

[00:47:58.320 --> 00:47:58.720]
Anyone.

[00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:00.140]
I don't care what's one of those.

[00:48:00.260 --> 00:48:00.660]
Anyone.

[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:01.460]
I heard the dot.

[00:48:02.100 --> 00:48:07.160]
I heard the John's that Donald is a cross the street at 10 a.m.

[00:48:07.340 --> 00:48:07.660]
To be.

[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:08.400]
Yeah.

[00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:09.360]
That's his new size.

[00:48:09.540 --> 00:48:10.500]
And also Neil.

[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:11.480]
Oh, man.

[00:48:11.700 --> 00:48:12.700]
What about it?

[00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:16.520]
They're trying to switch you guys up and tell the clock and try to

[00:48:16.520 --> 00:48:16.940]
write for you.

[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:18.500]
But they can never do it.

[00:48:18.500 --> 00:48:19.760]
But they can never take your ratings back.

[00:48:20.260 --> 00:48:23.920]
They put simply killing the morning back because he couldn't take it at 10 o'clock, man.

[00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:25.060]
He could take it all right.

[00:48:25.100 --> 00:48:25.500]
Neil.

[00:48:25.760 --> 00:48:26.400]
And about that.

[00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:27.440]
What's going on?

[00:48:27.440 --> 00:48:28.480]
I can't believe it's done.

[00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:29.400]
I don't have nobody, man.

[00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:30.980]
It's not a little push of them, even.

[00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:34.560]
Did you get all that?

[00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:35.220]
Yeah.

[00:48:35.580 --> 00:48:36.120]
I wrote it down.

[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:38.320]
WQIAM.

[00:48:38.420 --> 00:48:38.560]
Hello.

[00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:40.060]
Yeah, Neil.

[00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:40.880]
Yes, sir.

[00:48:41.260 --> 00:48:41.780]
How you doing today?

[00:48:41.960 --> 00:48:43.580]
I still got nothing to apologize.

[00:48:43.860 --> 00:48:44.400]
Have a nice week.

[00:48:47.120 --> 00:48:47.880]
How do you like that?

[00:48:49.420 --> 00:48:49.800]
See that?

[00:48:49.860 --> 00:48:50.360]
That to me.

[00:48:50.440 --> 00:48:51.440]
You're not doing me any favors.

[00:48:51.620 --> 00:48:51.800]
OK.

[00:48:51.900 --> 00:48:53.240]
Don't call the tell me you have nothing to say.

[00:48:53.320 --> 00:48:53.960]
I already know that.

[00:48:56.200 --> 00:48:57.140]
714 again on there.

[00:48:57.180 --> 00:48:57.560]
Look at that.

[00:48:59.240 --> 00:49:02.020]
On your drug station, let's start pedaling drugs on here.

[00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:02.280]
OK.

[00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:03.720]
I mean, we got spots for everything else.

[00:49:06.840 --> 00:49:09.880]
Joe Rose is back with Kevin Feederline in the morning.

[00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:14.660]
714 on the pool in Scott for Rowsling, but just barely edging out D-fo.

[00:49:15.500 --> 00:49:17.140]
I don't get that at all.

[00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:21.460]
Again, maybe that's just because I'm not a big D-fo fan, you know what?

[00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:23.540]
Can't go a segment without mentioning Neil Roger.

[00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:30.640]
5.6 of there that was during his insecure, um, rumor days, you know?

[00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:31.660]
Oh, I know.

[00:49:32.180 --> 00:49:34.980]
When he thought rumor was going to give his job, but I would never have seen anybody.

[00:49:35.340 --> 00:49:36.640]
Now, I take that back, Greg B. Dell.

[00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:40.180]
Let's have an insecurity contest between D-fo and Greg B. Dell.

[00:49:42.680 --> 00:49:43.600]
W-D-Q-A-M, hello.

[00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:48.880]
Oh, yeah, speaking of John Timothy, do you think he's got a long night's stat?

[00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:50.040]
W-D-Q-A-M, hello.

[00:49:50.860 --> 00:49:52.120]
Very Neil, how you doing today?

[00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:53.000]
Okay, sir.

[00:49:53.300 --> 00:49:57.640]
Listen, let's have Nick Navall be the chief of police again to do the other drug deal.

[00:49:57.960 --> 00:49:58.780]
W-D-Q-A-M, hello.

[00:50:01.180 --> 00:50:01.960]
Q-A-M.

[00:50:02.180 --> 00:50:02.620]
Hello, Neil.

[00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:03.380]
Yes.

[00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:04.480]
How you doing, sir?

[00:50:04.940 --> 00:50:05.160]
Okay.

[00:50:05.960 --> 00:50:09.040]
You know, I was wondering if you ever got that information on a diabetes medication

[00:50:09.040 --> 00:50:11.160]
and I sent your Latino partner.

[00:50:13.880 --> 00:50:15.780]
Information on diabetes medication?

[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:16.760]
I sent you that.

[00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:19.040]
That might say a thing about that diabetes medication.

[00:50:19.220 --> 00:50:20.600]
I thought you'd benefit from it.

[00:50:20.600 --> 00:50:23.760]
And you told me to send it to your ornate.

[00:50:23.980 --> 00:50:24.800]
Yeah, I mean, I never sent anything.

[00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:26.240]
Did you ever send me anything about that?

[00:50:26.280 --> 00:50:27.060]
I never got anything.

[00:50:27.860 --> 00:50:28.860]
I definitely didn't.

[00:50:28.960 --> 00:50:28.980]
I definitely didn't.

[00:50:28.980 --> 00:50:31.660]
Why don't you f-off or die?

[00:50:33.100 --> 00:50:33.320]
Oh.

[00:50:36.940 --> 00:50:37.300]
Yeah.

[00:50:37.380 --> 00:50:38.160]
Maybe in that order.

[00:50:38.980 --> 00:50:38.980]

[00:50:39.660 --> 00:50:43.220]
No, I sent it to, I sent it in care of George Rodriguez at the station.

[00:50:43.820 --> 00:50:45.320]
Yeah, well, somebody intercepted it.

[00:50:45.940 --> 00:50:48.060]
Well, I'll have to, I'll send it for you again.

[00:50:48.580 --> 00:50:49.560]
Okay, keep sending it.

[00:50:51.940 --> 00:50:54.340]
56670560.560 in the Verizon singular wireless line.

[00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:56.160]
Well, I sure missed these days, baby.

[00:50:56.340 --> 00:50:56.980]
Pumping those numbers.

[00:50:57.400 --> 00:50:59.140]
Pumping and pumping and pumping and pumping.

[00:51:00.020 --> 00:51:01.620]
Even bupping never pumped so much.

[00:51:01.900 --> 00:51:03.200]
760 votes on the pool.

[00:51:03.920 --> 00:51:04.720]
What are we going to make today?

[00:51:04.840 --> 00:51:05.700]
900 do you think, Chris?

[00:51:06.400 --> 00:51:07.340]
Let's go for 950 again.

[00:51:07.720 --> 00:51:08.300]
No, let's not.

[00:51:09.260 --> 00:51:10.180]
We can keep it.

[00:51:10.260 --> 00:51:11.340]
Let's keep it nice and low.

[00:51:11.560 --> 00:51:12.600]
Okay, let's know no stress.

[00:51:13.940 --> 00:51:14.560]
WDQYM, hello.

[00:51:14.860 --> 00:51:15.120]
Yes.

[00:51:15.740 --> 00:51:16.460]
I admit it is.

[00:51:16.540 --> 00:51:18.300]
No, why you not take the calls, man.

[00:51:18.300 --> 00:51:21.760]
Your connoisseurs are things that don't have it together like them.

[00:51:21.780 --> 00:51:23.740]
Yeah, like Reverend Jones, I know.

[00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:25.820]
They don't got it together like that, Schmuck.

[00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:28.760]
QYM.

[00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:32.740]
He's not even there anymore.

[00:51:33.080 --> 00:51:36.380]
So you keep blocking line nine and that takes away an opportunity to hear that.

[00:51:37.980 --> 00:51:39.060]
Why do you keep doing that?

[00:51:39.180 --> 00:51:40.500]
You wouldn't want to miss out on that, no, I do.

[00:51:40.960 --> 00:51:42.480]
Chris, you want to hear him say Hitler.

[00:51:43.340 --> 00:51:44.540]
I don't care what he says.

[00:51:44.820 --> 00:51:45.600]
He doesn't say that.

[00:51:46.020 --> 00:51:46.560]
Oh, he doesn't?

[00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:47.120]
No.

[00:51:47.480 --> 00:51:48.400]
I don't know what you're drinking.

[00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:50.320]
You, let's Gilbert that says Hitler.

[00:51:50.360 --> 00:51:51.540]
Yeah, you're confused, man.

[00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:53.560]
No, they both call in on that line.

[00:51:53.560 --> 00:51:56.140]
They're both sitting in the same room and they just take turns calling.

[00:51:56.160 --> 00:51:57.800]
Look, it keeps him off the street.

[00:51:57.960 --> 00:51:58.220]
Okay.

[00:51:59.060 --> 00:52:01.140]
Why if they're on the street they might get hit by a car.

[00:52:01.820 --> 00:52:03.380]
See, it's one thing the screen it calls.

[00:52:03.580 --> 00:52:06.100]
It's another thing to start passing judgment on whom we're going to talk to.

[00:52:06.940 --> 00:52:08.780]
And then Gilbert's going to come down.

[00:52:08.940 --> 00:52:11.580]
There's still just thumb in his mouth or wherever he's going to put it.

[00:52:11.820 --> 00:52:14.680]
And sit in the corner and cry during the whole show every day.

[00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:15.960]
And you're going to have to look at it.

[00:52:15.960 --> 00:52:17.900]
Ask George, I'll tell you.

[00:52:18.020 --> 00:52:19.880]
Ooh, you don't want to look at that.

720 votes on our world famous pool.

[00:52:22.860 --> 00:52:24.300]
We had a lady called today.

[00:52:24.340 --> 00:52:25.140]
Oh, thank God.

[00:52:26.680 --> 00:52:28.540]
And now, why did you do that on three?

[00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:29.900]
What are you doing with those?

[00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:30.980]
That was them again.

[00:52:31.600 --> 00:52:32.380]
WQA M. Hello.

[00:52:33.380 --> 00:52:34.220]
Superman, man.

[00:52:34.860 --> 00:52:36.340]
I love you, superman.

[00:52:37.240 --> 00:52:38.020]
WQA M. Hello.

[00:52:41.100 --> 00:52:41.540]
Hola.

[00:52:42.040 --> 00:52:42.400]
Yeah.

[00:52:42.900 --> 00:52:43.180]
Yeah.

[00:52:43.660 --> 00:52:44.180]
Hey, Neil.

[00:52:44.180 --> 00:52:46.620]
I see you got depot doing well on your pole.

[00:52:46.820 --> 00:52:50.180]
And I noticed that last week he just disappeared from the face of the earth.

[00:52:50.660 --> 00:52:52.120]
Well, for 790 to the decade.

[00:52:52.580 --> 00:52:54.340]
So maybe somebody might know what happened to him.

[00:52:54.580 --> 00:52:55.040]
Thanks, Pally.

[00:52:55.620 --> 00:52:56.500]
We don't care.

[00:52:57.200 --> 00:52:59.880]
12 minutes after 11 o'clock in the QAM.

[00:53:00.120 --> 00:53:00.960]
We couldn't care less.

[00:53:01.280 --> 00:53:03.460]
We're the costumer store in trouble.

[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:05.680]
But we're not just looking crack.

[00:53:06.220 --> 00:53:08.300]
A life that's turned to rubble.

[00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:10.080]
We're a star quarterback.

[00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:13.760]
He may doggy's mind until they die.

[00:53:15.040 --> 00:53:18.880]
No more parties like he just lost millions from liking.

[00:53:19.220 --> 00:53:20.200]
He made new friends.

[00:53:20.920 --> 00:53:23.240]
New LePeta and Suri.

[00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:27.200]
Yes, his life will be held.

[00:53:28.420 --> 00:53:32.200]
A year to 18 months in a jail cell.

[00:53:32.480 --> 00:53:35.360]
All it's money and his pain will go away.

[00:53:36.240 --> 00:53:38.400]
It's time to pay.

[00:53:39.140 --> 00:53:40.540]
Can't call a play.

[00:53:40.540 --> 00:53:41.780]
B.

[00:53:42.740 --> 00:53:44.180]
Cuz B.

[00:53:45.480 --> 00:53:46.800]
Hit the crime.

[00:53:47.480 --> 00:53:49.940]
And now he must do the crime.

[00:53:50.320 --> 00:53:52.200]
The generous Michael Payne.

[00:53:52.220 --> 00:53:53.700]
Why did he say that?

[00:53:53.840 --> 00:53:55.580]
Now it's time to make things right.

[00:53:55.740 --> 00:53:57.400]
Better cover up at night.

[00:53:57.400 --> 00:53:59.080]
Don't close your eyes tight.

[00:53:59.460 --> 00:54:03.120]
Every prisoner should get a bite hit the crime.

[00:54:03.760 --> 00:54:06.120]
And so he must do the crime.

[00:54:06.600 --> 00:54:08.080]
He'll be selling cigarettes.

[00:54:08.080 --> 00:54:09.820]
Not playing with cigarettes.

[00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:11.540]
He's turning into a female.

[00:54:12.180 --> 00:54:14.060]
When Michael Payne gets locked up,

[00:54:14.280 --> 00:54:15.780]
he rates him on stage.

[00:54:16.640 --> 00:54:16.640]

[00:54:18.080 --> 00:54:21.160]
He may never recover his own major sacrifice.

[00:54:21.160 --> 00:54:23.820]
At the cell is mentioned and his cattle act.

[00:54:23.880 --> 00:54:25.520]
The super-sucked like they knew it.

[00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:28.940]
It's history and into the Pope's trading sector's boi.

[00:54:29.260 --> 00:54:31.500]
And it's all because he did the crime.

[00:54:32.080 --> 00:54:34.640]
And so he must do the crime.

[00:54:34.640 --> 00:54:36.900]
The generous Michael Payne.

[00:54:36.900 --> 00:54:38.400]
Why did he say that?

[00:54:38.540 --> 00:54:40.360]
Now it's time to make things right.

[00:54:40.600 --> 00:54:41.760]
Gonna be hell.

[00:54:42.020 --> 00:54:44.660]
Say I am scared by an apple.

[00:54:47.380 --> 00:54:47.900]
Michael.

[00:54:50.120 --> 00:54:50.640]
Michael.

[00:54:52.280 --> 00:54:53.600]
I hope that you contract.

[00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:55.020]
Ray B.

[00:54:55.980 --> 00:54:57.180]
Lament 18 and 5.

[00:54:57.360 --> 00:54:58.920]
Maybe they could put Ken Jenny and Michael

[00:54:58.920 --> 00:55:00.080]
Vic in the same cell together.

[00:55:00.380 --> 00:55:00.880]
What up, dog?

[00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:02.080]
I'm gonna see you now.

[00:55:03.120 --> 00:55:04.860]
I don't answer any more calls.

[00:55:05.040 --> 00:55:06.300]
By the way, we're not going to screen him anymore.

[00:55:06.320 --> 00:55:07.380]
By the way, all the rejoins are like that.

[00:55:07.500 --> 00:55:08.120]
In case you haven't noticed.

[00:55:09.820 --> 00:55:10.900]
Listen, stunt endings.

[00:55:11.120 --> 00:55:12.740]
stunt rejoins is anything new on the station.

[00:55:13.160 --> 00:55:13.860]
Nice going, Claire.

[00:55:13.980 --> 00:55:15.180]
At least they do all consistently.

[00:55:15.880 --> 00:55:18.960]
You are putting together a real thing, man.

[00:55:19.420 --> 00:55:21.920]
Well, Doc told me to play the old rejoins that you knew the ending.

[00:55:22.120 --> 00:55:22.980]
Except you don't have those.

[00:55:23.080 --> 00:55:25.200]
Well, what difference would you make if I know the ending or not?

[00:55:25.360 --> 00:55:26.240]
Okay, I'll just wait.

[00:55:26.240 --> 00:55:27.040]
I'll just wait.

[00:55:27.380 --> 00:55:28.480]
We'll get used to them.

[00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:33.160]
5 6 7 0 5 60, pound 5 60, leave a residence in Singular wireless line.

[00:55:33.260 --> 00:55:33.800]
Don't answer them.

[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:34.780]
I'll take care of it.

[00:55:34.820 --> 00:55:35.040]
Okay.

[00:55:36.180 --> 00:55:36.840]
QAM, hello.

[00:55:37.240 --> 00:55:37.720]
Yes, sir.

[00:55:38.240 --> 00:55:40.820]
Do you know if Shu is still in the state business, sir?

[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:42.300]
Yeah.

[00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:46.740]
Does he have state houses in Miami, Dayton, Broward?

[00:55:47.280 --> 00:55:47.480]
Yeah.

[00:55:48.180 --> 00:55:49.740]
Oh, well, I never see him advertised.

[00:55:52.780 --> 00:55:53.840]
You got a phone book?

[00:55:54.640 --> 00:55:55.440]
Yeah, I'm broke.

[00:55:55.600 --> 00:55:57.700]
Open up the yellow pages, where it's just water on.

[00:55:57.780 --> 00:55:59.720]
Okay, open up the yellow pages, where it's his dumbbell.

[00:56:00.200 --> 00:56:01.820]
And maybe you'll find out what you're looking for.

[00:56:01.960 --> 00:56:02.240]
Shmuck.

[00:56:03.220 --> 00:56:07.200]
5 6 7 0 5 60, pound 5 60, in the Verizon Singular wireless line.

[00:56:07.320 --> 00:56:07.580]
Let's go.

[00:56:07.660 --> 00:56:08.280]
I scream less.

[00:56:08.520 --> 00:56:09.540]
Two hours and 41 minutes.

[00:56:09.680 --> 00:56:09.940]
Okay.

[00:56:10.900 --> 00:56:11.860]
You think we can do it?

[00:56:12.460 --> 00:56:13.200]
You can do something.

[00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:14.520]
WDQA and...

[00:56:14.520 --> 00:56:15.040]
Hello.

[00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:16.300]
Who is it?

[00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:16.600]
It's me, please.

[00:56:17.120 --> 00:56:17.400]
Speaking.

[00:56:18.180 --> 00:56:18.440]
Hello.

[00:56:18.860 --> 00:56:19.620]
You're going to scream less.

[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:20.140]
Yeah.

[00:56:20.580 --> 00:56:21.080]
Hey, Neil.

[00:56:21.080 --> 00:56:21.980]
I was wanting to know.

[00:56:22.860 --> 00:56:25.080]
You think that you could possibly get...

[00:56:25.780 --> 00:56:27.680]
I don't play the best of any time soon.

[00:56:28.360 --> 00:56:29.060]
Best of what?

[00:56:29.500 --> 00:56:30.920]
Best of our took tracks.

[00:56:31.120 --> 00:56:31.880]
And Reverend Joe.

[00:56:32.420 --> 00:56:33.800]
Yeah, and Reverend Joe's.

[00:56:33.980 --> 00:56:33.980]

[00:56:34.300 --> 00:56:36.240]
Sounded off much like him right off the bed.

[00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:36.520]
Did you?

[00:56:36.540 --> 00:56:36.740]
Sure did.

[00:56:37.480 --> 00:56:39.220]
I was waiting for something else to light up.

[00:56:39.920 --> 00:56:40.760]
WDQA and Hello.

[00:56:41.760 --> 00:56:42.420]
Yeah, hello.

[00:56:42.980 --> 00:56:43.220]
Yes.

[00:56:43.640 --> 00:56:44.440]
Let's speak to George.

[00:56:45.500 --> 00:56:45.760]
No.

[00:56:46.280 --> 00:56:47.580]
You don't want to talk to him.

[00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:48.240]
Absolutely.

[00:56:48.440 --> 00:56:48.580]
All right.

[00:56:49.980 --> 00:56:50.780]
WDQA and Hello.

[00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:51.760]
Hi, Neil.

[00:56:51.760 --> 00:56:52.340]
How are you today?

[00:56:52.780 --> 00:56:53.200]
Okay, sir.

[00:56:53.380 --> 00:56:53.660]
How are you?

[00:56:53.780 --> 00:56:53.900]
Good.

[00:56:54.220 --> 00:56:55.020]
I'm doing very well.

[00:56:55.320 --> 00:56:56.560]
You know, I just...

[00:56:56.560 --> 00:56:57.920]
Are you Keith Olberman, fan?

[00:56:59.340 --> 00:57:03.480]
Do you listen to this show, sir?

[00:57:03.860 --> 00:57:04.700]
Yes, sir, every day.

[00:57:04.980 --> 00:57:09.100]
I was a big Keith Olberman fan until he stabbed I'mus in the back and got him fired, and then I've

[00:57:09.100 --> 00:57:09.700]
to screw him.

[00:57:10.220 --> 00:57:10.720]
Oh, I didn't...

[00:57:10.720 --> 00:57:13.780]
I must have missed that particular show because I didn't hear you ran away.

[00:57:13.860 --> 00:57:15.960]
I mentioned that many times, sir, many times.

[00:57:16.080 --> 00:57:19.240]
Anybody in this business that spends their time trying to get other people fired?

[00:57:19.240 --> 00:57:19.960]
No, no, no.

[00:57:20.020 --> 00:57:22.080]
How come in dread as they say in Sweden?

[00:57:22.680 --> 00:57:25.340]
Don't you like what he does about Bill O'Reilly with the worst person in the world?

[00:57:25.600 --> 00:57:28.100]
Oh, you know, something every day says the same thing.

[00:57:28.180 --> 00:57:28.880]
Don't you like it?

[00:57:29.060 --> 00:57:29.680]
It grow up, sir.

[00:57:29.900 --> 00:57:30.480]
Grow up already.

[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:32.300]
Don't you like what he says?

[00:57:34.320 --> 00:57:36.740]
Yeah, the first 6,000 times it was pretty funny.

[00:57:38.480 --> 00:57:39.240]
WDQA and Hello.

[00:57:40.900 --> 00:57:41.260]
Hello.

[00:57:42.400 --> 00:57:42.640]
Hello.

[00:57:42.680 --> 00:57:42.980]
Hello, Neil.

[00:57:43.360 --> 00:57:45.220]
It's Lily Ann from the Jeff Doe Talk Band.

[00:57:45.400 --> 00:57:45.700]
How you been?

[00:57:46.820 --> 00:57:47.440]
Chuck and Joseph.

[00:57:48.600 --> 00:57:49.220]
WDQA and Hello.

[00:57:49.220 --> 00:57:49.220]

[00:57:49.220 --> 00:57:49.220]

[00:57:49.220 --> 00:57:49.220]

[00:57:49.220 --> 00:57:49.260]
Hello.

[00:57:49.600 --> 00:57:50.080]
Hi, Neil.

[00:57:50.640 --> 00:57:50.780]
Yes.

[00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:52.000]
I'm Amy and Greg.

[00:57:52.060 --> 00:57:53.400]
Just wanted to say hello.

[00:57:53.520 --> 00:57:54.160]
See how you're doing?

[00:57:55.960 --> 00:57:56.440]
Yeah.

[00:57:57.120 --> 00:57:59.560]
And, you know, it's chronic Tuesday.

[00:58:00.320 --> 00:58:01.260]
That's what we should call it.

[00:58:01.340 --> 00:58:01.920]
Chronic Tuesday.

[00:58:02.360 --> 00:58:03.100]
Well, what does that mean?

[00:58:03.500 --> 00:58:04.660]
What's the...

[00:58:04.660 --> 00:58:05.480]
You know what that means?

[00:58:05.620 --> 00:58:06.640]
It means you have nothing to say.

[00:58:06.980 --> 00:58:09.220]
No, I love saying is that you have nothing to say.

[00:58:09.220 --> 00:58:11.020]
It means you have nothing to say.

[00:58:11.460 --> 00:58:14.100]
I love saying is that there's two...

[00:58:14.100 --> 00:58:15.400]
There's two fans of yours.

[00:58:16.580 --> 00:58:17.800]
You follow me.

[00:58:18.480 --> 00:58:19.700]
There's two fans of mine.

[00:58:19.800 --> 00:58:22.020]
I think at this point, I think I'll be lucky to have two, yeah.

[00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:24.920]
Well, so Greg from Pointe, Port Saint-Lousie.

[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:25.760]
Oh, those two.

[00:58:25.920 --> 00:58:26.340]
Oh, I see.

[00:58:27.060 --> 00:58:27.720]
WDQA and Hello.

[00:58:28.380 --> 00:58:29.040]
Yeah, hi, Neil.

[00:58:29.580 --> 00:58:29.840]
Yes.

[00:58:30.040 --> 00:58:32.900]
You sound a good this morning, but I bet he missed a still-gotts.

[00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:34.000]
I love still-gotts.

[00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:35.100]
I love still-gotts.

[00:58:38.780 --> 00:58:39.500]
Oh, brother.

[00:58:40.200 --> 00:58:41.860]
Talk about needing mental help.

[00:58:42.500 --> 00:58:44.840]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5.

[00:58:45.080 --> 00:58:46.900]
By the way, how many a week's there worth of coupons

[00:58:46.900 --> 00:58:49.000]
as he's still trying to pedal for those restaurants he's got?

[00:58:49.460 --> 00:58:49.980]
Stubles.

[00:58:51.240 --> 00:58:52.140]
WDQA and Hello.

[00:58:55.300 --> 00:58:56.200]
QA and Hello.

[00:58:56.880 --> 00:58:58.900]
Yeah, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.

[00:58:59.680 --> 00:59:00.560]
WDQA and Hello.

[00:59:01.440 --> 00:59:03.620]
Yeah, Fien Art and Jenny.

[00:59:05.080 --> 00:59:05.420]
Yeah.

[00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:10.420]
And WDQA and Hello.

[00:59:11.360 --> 00:59:12.120]
Hey, how's it going?

[00:59:12.640 --> 00:59:12.920]
Okay.

[00:59:12.920 --> 00:59:15.480]
Hey, what is the price of Ken, Jenny?

[00:59:15.660 --> 00:59:19.560]
First, he falsifies cars to district, and now he falsifies taxes.

[00:59:19.800 --> 00:59:20.880]
What a big surprise, huh?

[00:59:21.280 --> 00:59:21.460]
Yeah.

[00:59:21.800 --> 00:59:23.040]
Maybe I got a big surprise.

[00:59:23.860 --> 00:59:26.240]
Yeah, well, I hope he gets your coming through him.

[00:59:27.280 --> 00:59:27.860]
And more.

[00:59:28.360 --> 00:59:28.780]
And more.

[00:59:29.340 --> 00:59:30.380]
20, 30 years, more.

[00:59:30.540 --> 00:59:33.120]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60.

[00:59:33.540 --> 00:59:34.500]
I'm even rising and singular.

[00:59:34.620 --> 00:59:35.860]
Why, look at the way they're smoking, man.

[00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:36.140]
See?

[00:59:37.080 --> 00:59:37.900]
They're smoking something.

[00:59:38.860 --> 00:59:39.840]
And it's nice to share.

[00:59:40.140 --> 00:59:41.800]
And we got 740 votes on the pool.

[00:59:41.800 --> 00:59:43.880]
We're going to make 800 if it's the last damn thing we do.

[00:59:44.020 --> 00:59:46.680]
And then I might come back through the whole of the schedule here.

[00:59:46.800 --> 00:59:48.840]
He said, now that he coming here and changing it, and all of what?

[00:59:49.180 --> 00:59:50.280]
Clarence, your boyfriend.

[00:59:50.500 --> 00:59:51.320]
The schedule, no.

[00:59:51.780 --> 00:59:52.300]
Well, why not?

[00:59:52.680 --> 00:59:56.100]
Yeah, because on Thursday, I think that sounds like a real winner to me.

[00:59:56.260 --> 00:59:57.160]
Don't go getting nighty.

[00:59:57.200 --> 00:59:59.680]
You already had a guy that wanted to talk to you a little while ago,

[00:59:59.720 --> 01:00:00.860]
and you just blew him right off.

[01:00:00.940 --> 01:00:01.680]
Hey, call me tomorrow.

[01:00:02.360 --> 01:00:03.160]
Yeah, call him tomorrow.

[01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:04.300]
He can use the call.

[01:00:05.020 --> 01:00:06.400]
Or he'll spin some more wax.

[01:00:07.700 --> 01:00:08.480]
WDQA and Hello.

[01:00:12.020 --> 01:00:13.540]
How you doing, Uncle Neil?

[01:00:13.980 --> 01:00:14.420]
Okay, sir.

[01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:21.620]
I could only wish that all the new people that come into Florida listen to your show when you go screenless,

[01:00:22.220 --> 01:00:26.000]
and listen to all the idiots to get the deal with living here, and they turn around and go back.

[01:00:26.580 --> 01:00:27.220]
Yeah, if there's some money.

[01:00:27.980 --> 01:00:33.340]
I hate to reduce your talent, such as, you know, like a meaningless task.

[01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:36.360]
The hell with the callers?

[01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:37.100]
You know, hell with them.

[01:00:37.380 --> 01:00:37.800]
Hell with them.

[01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:39.040]
Take care of them.

[01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:40.060]
Hell with you today.

[01:00:40.860 --> 01:00:41.120]
Yeah.

[01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:42.480]
Yeah.

[01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:45.340]
WDQA and Hello.

[01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:50.580]
I'm driving my word truck right now with nothing but a screwdriver up my red thumb.

[01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:52.580]
Well, it's getting really busy in here.

[01:00:52.700 --> 01:00:53.340]
QA and Hello.

[01:00:53.700 --> 01:00:54.180]
Hey, yeah.

[01:00:54.460 --> 01:00:54.840]
Yes.

[01:00:55.140 --> 01:00:55.680]
That's a question.

[01:00:56.260 --> 01:00:56.700]
Yeah.

[01:00:57.240 --> 01:00:59.620]
I've come, uh, this is something.

[01:00:59.780 --> 01:01:00.500]
What do you got in your mouth?

[01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:01.860]
You got the same screwdriver in your mouth.

[01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:03.760]
The other guy's got his asses at it.

[01:01:04.820 --> 01:01:05.620]
WDQA and Hello.

[01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:06.640]
Yes.

[01:01:06.900 --> 01:01:13.560]
And the governor Chris negotiations with the seminal Indian for casino gaming table games.

[01:01:13.780 --> 01:01:18.860]
Do you know if the seminals are trying to get crafts or is it just limited to court?

[01:01:18.860 --> 01:01:20.420]
I think the seminals are full of crap.

[01:01:20.420 --> 01:01:21.160]
How do you like that?

[01:01:21.740 --> 01:01:22.720]
Oh, you shouldn't have said that.

[01:01:22.820 --> 01:01:23.720]
They spent a lot of money.

[01:01:23.860 --> 01:01:24.260]
Okay.

[01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:25.420]
I love the seminals.

[01:01:25.980 --> 01:01:26.740]
I love the engines.

[01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:29.660]
Maybe that's why D-Foay and on the station anymore because he's a...

[01:01:29.660 --> 01:01:31.780]
I mean, that's what it's all about.

[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:32.140]
You think?

[01:01:32.740 --> 01:01:34.460]
How is the Marvin and Romand doing, by the way?

[01:01:34.460 --> 01:01:37.020]
How do that deal come down with the engines?

[01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:38.460]
What about it?

[01:01:39.020 --> 01:01:39.820]
WDQA and Hello.

[01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:42.020]
Hey, Emil, how you doing?

[01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:42.700]
I'm leaving tomorrow.

[01:01:42.900 --> 01:01:43.880]
I want to wish a...

[01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:44.760]
Russia, Sean, eh?

[01:01:46.500 --> 01:01:47.520]
Russia, Sean, eh?

[01:01:47.540 --> 01:01:47.540]

[01:01:47.940 --> 01:01:48.600]
It's next week.

[01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:49.780]
It's next week.

[01:01:49.780 --> 01:01:49.920]
It's next week.

[01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:50.680]

[01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:52.020]
It's next week.

[01:01:52.020 --> 01:01:52.020]

[01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:54.140]
Sometime next week.

[01:01:54.260 --> 01:01:54.940]
Yeah, sometime next week.

[01:01:54.940 --> 01:01:54.940]

[01:01:54.980 --> 01:01:55.280]
All right.

[01:01:55.380 --> 01:01:56.160]
I've learned how it is.

[01:01:56.580 --> 01:01:58.700]
Don't start with your premature evaluation, okay?

[01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:01.180]
Well, Castle Hoyes Valley.

[01:02:01.460 --> 01:02:01.960]
It's a 12th row.

[01:02:02.420 --> 01:02:04.060]
It's a 12th, is a happy Russian.

[01:02:04.260 --> 01:02:05.700]
Oh, no wonder we got Sura's baby.

[01:02:06.140 --> 01:02:08.560]
You got Russia, Sean, and Jung Kipper, and all these other...

[01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:09.520]
...ah, Jew holidays coming up.

[01:02:09.580 --> 01:02:10.060]
My God.

[01:02:10.700 --> 01:02:11.480]
What chance of we got?

[01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:13.180]
We got a kind of Chinaman's chance in Jerusalem.

[01:02:13.900 --> 01:02:13.900]

[01:02:15.340 --> 01:02:16.400]
742 votes on the pool.

[01:02:16.580 --> 01:02:18.760]
Which department of Q&N personality do you miss the most?

[01:02:19.300 --> 01:02:20.540]
Scott Farrell, 191.

[01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:22.700]
D-Foay, 164.

[01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:25.360]
Mohauer, David, 149.

[01:02:25.740 --> 01:02:27.500]
None of the above is climbing up 101.

[01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:29.160]
That might actually win.

[01:02:29.900 --> 01:02:31.460]
Gildey, only 68.

[01:02:32.660 --> 01:02:35.020]
The Crow 42, Kenny Walker, only 18.

[01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:35.780]
He voted again.

[01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:38.140]
And Ron Hersey, Salamente Nguyenvay.

[01:03:00.740 --> 01:03:03.140]
Wow, it's a soda can.

[01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:04.120]
But why?

[01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:06.460]
Boy, that is good.

[01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:09.880]
Leave me on my child.

[01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:18.040]
My lawyer says it's worth white hell for some.

[01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:27.700]
Cause I've been looking around when excuse to explain my quirk.

[01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:34.320]
You can't recognize me.

[01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:41.060]
My doctors have bleached out my ethnicity.

[01:03:42.500 --> 01:03:45.620]
And I keep children around.

[01:03:46.700 --> 01:03:52.320]
And they sleep inside my bed.

[01:03:55.460 --> 01:03:59.320]
People say that I am gay.

[01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:05.260]
That is why I'm happy to be some real.

[01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:13.780]
But it's way too late to compensate with this song.

[01:04:16.260 --> 01:04:18.540]
That's really bad.

[01:04:23.300 --> 01:04:26.500]
Glein it on my child.

[01:04:29.820 --> 01:04:35.660]
And all of those toys that I never had.

[01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:39.320]
You only see a show in my life.

[01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:43.500]
What might fall out of you's dead.

[01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:48.320]
You only see a show in my life.

[01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:53.820]
Before you judge me.

[01:04:54.620 --> 01:04:56.760]
And call me free.

[01:04:58.500 --> 01:05:03.800]
Let me find and touch and say.

[01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:08.840]
You failed.

[01:05:10.280 --> 01:05:16.160]
I believe in all my child.

[01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:21.800]
Love a 33, 27, I'll do this 5, 60, WQAM.

[01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:23.940]
You're used to dare to be great station.

[01:05:24.140 --> 01:05:26.940]
I blame it on Jolly Joedville as who I blame it on.

[01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:30.100]
Now you tell me that you said yesterday everything they like is crap.

[01:05:30.580 --> 01:05:31.360]
Yeah, on the air.

[01:05:31.700 --> 01:05:34.480]
And not just this management, but especially this management.

[01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:36.500]
Every management and every radio station in this town.

[01:05:36.580 --> 01:05:37.700]
Everything you like sucks.

[01:05:38.740 --> 01:05:41.340]
I mean, I worked for some really nid with people.

[01:05:41.420 --> 01:05:43.260]
I worked for Stanley J. Cohen at INZ.

[01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:46.000]
I worked for the son-in-law of the owner of the station Tim Williams,

[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:49.300]
who was a total zero fool, a jerk.

[01:05:50.340 --> 01:05:53.500]
And these guys were rocket scientists compared to what we got now.

[01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.440]
I mean, this guy is clueless.

[01:05:58.180 --> 01:05:58.640]
Clueless.

[01:05:59.660 --> 01:06:01.640]
We are working for a man who's like,

[01:06:02.140 --> 01:06:05.240]
like they let him out of an asylum somewhere.

[01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:09.180]
But hey, each year we live in a demon baby.

[01:06:09.360 --> 01:06:09.900]
We got the dolphins.

[01:06:10.100 --> 01:06:11.500]
And since we got the dolphins back,

[01:06:11.900 --> 01:06:16.140]
the numbers on this station are vanished like the vanishing ink they have.

[01:06:16.260 --> 01:06:16.760]
It's like that.

[01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:19.660]
Yeah, disappearing crap.

[01:06:22.380 --> 01:06:23.020]
5.670560,

[01:06:23.260 --> 01:06:25.640]
pound 5.60 under Verizon's singular wireless line.

[01:06:25.720 --> 01:06:26.960]
The verdict is in in my mind.

[01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:29.200]
And that is starting on Monday when I go back full-time.

[01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:31.100]
I'm doing the show out the way I want to do it.

[01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:32.300]
No, no, don't do that.

[01:06:32.500 --> 01:06:32.900]
Yeah, yeah.

[01:06:32.900 --> 01:06:33.880]
Do it the way other people want to.

[01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:36.740]
The way that it's been working for many, many months now without this craft.

[01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:38.700]
But nevertheless, this is Joe Bell's idea.

[01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:42.400]
Oh, I think it's really great the way you're hearing your way you interact with the cars.

[01:06:43.580 --> 01:06:44.500]
With the same four people.

[01:06:44.540 --> 01:06:45.640]
Yeah, you heard all his other ideas.

[01:06:46.680 --> 01:06:46.860]
Yeah.

[01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:50.780]
What he knows about talk radio and about this show in particular,

[01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:54.780]
you could stick in the thingle and have room for 15 of his fantasies left over with.

[01:06:59.880 --> 01:07:01.360]
Screamless and a rena-call on the board.

[01:07:01.620 --> 01:07:03.740]
Screamless and there's nothing.

[01:07:06.220 --> 01:07:07.020]
5.670560,

[01:07:07.760 --> 01:07:10.840]
pound 5.60 under Verizon's singular wireless line.

[01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:14.180]
Are we actually on the air as is a joke?

[01:07:14.340 --> 01:07:15.820]
This reminds me of that SCTV thing.

[01:07:15.820 --> 01:07:16.200]
Great.

[01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:24.840]
I'll wait for the six minute delay to catch up.

[01:07:26.700 --> 01:07:28.040]
757, baby, we're flying it.

[01:07:28.100 --> 01:07:29.820]
That's how many votes we got on our award winning pool.

[01:07:30.300 --> 01:07:32.400]
And Depot was a surprising second on there.

[01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:35.960]
Maybe we got to set out a search party and get him back.

[01:07:39.880 --> 01:07:40.580]
WQIN, hello.

[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:44.400]
QIN.

[01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:45.440]
Good morning, Neil.

[01:07:45.840 --> 01:07:46.300]
Yes.

[01:07:46.620 --> 01:07:46.920]
Yes.

[01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:48.580]
When a phoney voice, you know,

[01:07:48.580 --> 01:07:50.800]
I want to see Jim Mans kick your ass.

[01:07:51.180 --> 01:07:52.020]
WQIN, hello.

[01:07:52.660 --> 01:07:53.180]
Shambar.

[01:07:55.660 --> 01:07:56.360]
That's cute.

[01:07:59.140 --> 01:08:00.660]
Like a priest, he said,

[01:08:00.780 --> 01:08:02.140]
what can we do without these calls?

[01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:03.740]
Wow.

[01:08:04.780 --> 01:08:05.660]
WQIN, hello.

[01:08:08.420 --> 01:08:09.300]
QIN, hello.

[01:08:09.880 --> 01:08:10.600]
Hey, buddy.

[01:08:11.420 --> 01:08:12.260]
Part of the problem is,

[01:08:12.260 --> 01:08:14.300]
there'll be a likes talk and a fat show over there.

[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:16.500]
A phone screener.

[01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:17.000]
Yeah.

[01:08:17.420 --> 01:08:17.640]
Yeah.

[01:08:18.180 --> 01:08:21.260]
He's the, he doesn't mean you want.

[01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:22.380]
He's not enough.

[01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:23.920]
That is a noxious.

[01:08:24.020 --> 01:08:24.840]
Oh, I think that I can.

[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:26.140]
Yeah, well, if he's scared you away,

[01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:26.920]
that would be a bonus.

[01:08:26.920 --> 01:08:27.240]
It's worse.

[01:08:27.460 --> 01:08:28.260]
He needs to step it up.

[01:08:28.380 --> 01:08:29.620]
That would be a big bonus.

[01:08:30.700 --> 01:08:31.360]
WQIN, hello.

[01:08:32.580 --> 01:08:32.860]
Oh.

[01:08:33.540 --> 01:08:33.900]
Oh.

[01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:35.560]
I should have thought.

[01:08:38.360 --> 01:08:39.060]
What do you say?

[01:08:40.740 --> 01:08:41.400]
WQIN, hello.

[01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:42.680]
What was he mumbling?

[01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:44.900]
I'm going to work, I think, as what he said.

[01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:47.260]
WQIN, hello.

[01:08:48.280 --> 01:08:48.880]
Hello, Mia.

[01:08:49.380 --> 01:08:51.080]
At least if you're going to say something stupid,

[01:08:51.460 --> 01:08:52.120]
articulated to him,

[01:08:52.180 --> 01:08:52.980]
I don't understand what it is.

[01:08:53.100 --> 01:08:53.560]
Yes, ma'am.

[01:08:54.060 --> 01:08:55.880]
I don't understand so much, Mia.

[01:08:56.240 --> 01:08:56.620]
You're the guy.

[01:08:57.920 --> 01:08:58.240]
Yeah.

[01:08:58.800 --> 01:08:59.900]
I don't stop the call.

[01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:01.460]
I mean, I keep forgetting the number,

[01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:02.440]
that's why I get called, Mia.

[01:09:02.820 --> 01:09:03.860]
And most of the women with the picture,

[01:09:03.980 --> 01:09:05.340]
remember, but I can't forget to the phone.

[01:09:05.860 --> 01:09:07.180]
Have you got a bad phone or just,

[01:09:07.340 --> 01:09:09.100]
do you got a stocking in your mouth or what's the deal?

[01:09:09.460 --> 01:09:10.620]
Yeah, I got a bad phone.

[01:09:10.620 --> 01:09:11.880]
Oh, okay, well, good news.

[01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:14.680]
Fine, if you got a bad phone, don't call us.

[01:09:14.820 --> 01:09:15.900]
Okay, call across the street.

[01:09:16.100 --> 01:09:16.780]
Call over to IOD.

[01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:17.440]
Call up Rush.

[01:09:18.420 --> 01:09:18.800]
And say,

[01:09:18.980 --> 01:09:19.660]
Oh, you're a thief.

[01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:20.620]
You're a thief in the pool?

[01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:21.280]
Like that.

[01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:24.120]
That guy had a call about Keith Overman

[01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:25.240]
in a way he ripped it all over.

[01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:25.660]
I mean,

[01:09:26.500 --> 01:09:28.240]
kids in a sandbox, okay?

[01:09:28.520 --> 01:09:29.720]
Everything is a big game.

[01:09:29.940 --> 01:09:31.220]
Everything is a big political game.

[01:09:31.460 --> 01:09:32.800]
It's the right against the left.

[01:09:32.900 --> 01:09:33.140]
It's like,

[01:09:33.180 --> 01:09:34.840]
it's like we've gone back full cycle.

[01:09:35.400 --> 01:09:36.940]
To 31 and a half years ago,

[01:09:36.980 --> 01:09:38.620]
and I started on KAT with Shirley Spellerberg

[01:09:38.740 --> 01:09:39.820]
and Irv Schimmer.

[01:09:40.180 --> 01:09:41.200]
They're right against the left.

[01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:42.360]
They liberal in a conservative.

[01:09:42.660 --> 01:09:44.420]
They all tried and true crap.

[01:09:45.580 --> 01:09:46.140]
Yeah, like I said,

[01:09:46.260 --> 01:09:47.600]
the first 50,000 times you didn't,

[01:09:47.660 --> 01:09:48.340]
it was pretty funny.

[01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:50.900]
Nobody QAM, hello?

[01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:54.340]
Yeah, I think now that you're between the big dog

[01:09:54.340 --> 01:09:55.360]
and the mad dog,

[01:09:55.360 --> 01:09:58.220]
it's about time you had some kind of a canine-related nickname.

[01:09:58.420 --> 01:09:58.820]
So, if you think?

[01:09:59.120 --> 01:09:59.600]
Yeah, sure.

[01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:00.960]
It's like a dog sandwich.

[01:10:01.620 --> 01:10:01.880]
Mm-hmm.

[01:10:03.460 --> 01:10:04.700]
And what would that be?

[01:10:05.160 --> 01:10:05.440]
Gay dog.

[01:10:06.540 --> 01:10:07.720]
Yeah, that's, yeah.

[01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:08.500]
That's okay.

[01:10:08.820 --> 01:10:09.220]
Gay dog.

[01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:11.180]
Big dog, gay dog, mad dog.

[01:10:12.180 --> 01:10:12.500]
Hat dog.

[01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:14.860]
WQAM, not so hat dog.

[01:10:15.140 --> 01:10:15.540]
QAM.

[01:10:16.280 --> 01:10:16.640]
I said,

[01:10:16.820 --> 01:10:18.780]
yes, I knew that I was going to be with you.

[01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:19.840]
WQAM, hello?

[01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:21.320]
Hey, Neil.

[01:10:21.900 --> 01:10:22.660]
I know it's silly,

[01:10:22.860 --> 01:10:24.100]
but I love the cars, man.

[01:10:24.380 --> 01:10:24.940]
I'm obsessed.

[01:10:25.580 --> 01:10:25.880]
Sets.

[01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:29.080]
WQAM, hello?

[01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:30.340]
Hello, Neil.

[01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:31.040]
Yes.

[01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:32.920]
I just want to let you know

[01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:35.780]
I quit my job with absolutely no backup plan

[01:10:35.780 --> 01:10:37.800]
or really don't have much money either.

[01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:38.480]
Mm-hmm.

[01:10:39.060 --> 01:10:40.440]
And second of all, if you could do,

[01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:42.120]
I've heard a little bit of depot here and there.

[01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:43.680]
It seems harmlessly amusing,

[01:10:43.880 --> 01:10:46.520]
but if you could tell the whole full story with analysis

[01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:48.240]
and his whole-

[01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:49.600]
And now the analysis of what?

[01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:51.960]
When he started down here

[01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:54.680]
and what the story is always a loot to are,

[01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:56.680]
and I never quite knew the story behind this.

[01:10:56.680 --> 01:10:57.820]
The story is about what?

[01:10:59.100 --> 01:11:00.860]
How his career started here,

[01:11:01.100 --> 01:11:01.440]
and how-

[01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:03.620]
I haven't got any idea how his career started here.

[01:11:03.620 --> 01:11:04.460]
I haven't got a clue.

[01:11:04.680 --> 01:11:05.940]
He was an IOD when I went there.

[01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:07.580]
I haven't got any clue how his career started.

[01:11:07.780 --> 01:11:08.820]
I know how it ended though.

[01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:10.520]
abruptly.

[01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:13.220]
56670, 566.

[01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:14.040]
The phone is ringing.

[01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:15.480]
That must mean there's a distanced here.

[01:11:15.580 --> 01:11:16.700]
Ask me if I'm going to go get it.

[01:11:16.720 --> 01:11:16.840]
No.

[01:11:18.180 --> 01:11:18.740]
WQAM, hello?

[01:11:19.260 --> 01:11:20.460]
Neil, hey, I called you before.

[01:11:20.620 --> 01:11:22.300]
I forgot to tell you a few things about Greg.

[01:11:22.900 --> 01:11:23.320]
What's going on?

[01:11:23.860 --> 01:11:24.000]
Yeah.

[01:11:24.920 --> 01:11:25.440]
WQAM, hello?

[01:11:28.380 --> 01:11:28.700]
QAM?

[01:11:29.780 --> 01:11:30.100]
Yeah.

[01:11:30.700 --> 01:11:30.940]
Yeah.

[01:11:31.100 --> 01:11:31.100]

[01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:32.360]
Hi.

[01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:33.100]
Is this Bill?

[01:11:33.620 --> 01:11:34.500]
Sounds like me, yes.

[01:11:34.860 --> 01:11:35.480]
Oh, hi, Neil.

[01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:39.780]
Just turned on the radio, and I was wondering if you guys have

[01:11:39.780 --> 01:11:43.360]
talked about the Nazi, I mean Jenny's resignation.

[01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:45.180]
Yes, I have.

[01:11:45.540 --> 01:11:45.540]

[01:11:46.100 --> 01:11:46.500]
Okay.

[01:11:46.980 --> 01:11:47.200]
All right.

[01:11:47.340 --> 01:11:47.960]
Well, you know what?

[01:11:48.100 --> 01:11:50.980]
I think he's a, I'm not going to say it because it's going to get

[01:11:50.980 --> 01:11:51.540]
bleeped out.

[01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:52.660]
But you know what?

[01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:57.200]
The preferential treatment this guy is getting from the feds seconds me,

[01:11:57.760 --> 01:11:59.580]
and it makes me want to bomb it.

[01:11:59.580 --> 01:12:03.220]
Yeah, I'm going to the magic room right now, and I would peep my guts out.

[01:12:03.220 --> 01:12:04.180]
Not, but not see.

[01:12:04.380 --> 01:12:06.040]
I shot the sheriff.

[01:12:06.980 --> 01:12:10.740]
That fascist Nazi sheriff, Danny Jenny.

[01:12:13.140 --> 01:12:13.820]
Yeah.

[01:12:14.760 --> 01:12:16.660]
I shot the sheriff.

[01:12:17.940 --> 01:12:21.180]
When I told him he can kiss my feet.

[01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:29.160]
He's the picture of his child.

[01:12:30.700 --> 01:12:33.960]
Because he's the biggest pick around.

[01:12:36.580 --> 01:12:39.300]
To hipstack, such filthy.

[01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:44.760]
So don't ever let him catch it going down.

[01:12:45.860 --> 01:12:47.160]
He'll get busted.

[01:12:48.380 --> 01:12:51.160]
Oh my god.

[01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:53.740]
I shot the sheriff.

[01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:58.240]
I got the fancy color again and again.

[01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:04.560]
I shot the sheriff.

[01:13:05.740 --> 01:13:09.300]
He's a moody stoppin, which does not seem.

[01:13:13.300 --> 01:13:16.520]
He's a little bit smaller than his face.

[01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:22.580]
He's a little bit smaller than his face.

[01:13:22.920 --> 01:13:32.660]
His face is a little bit smaller than his face.

[01:13:33.820 --> 01:13:35.400]
He's not good.

[01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:41.420]
Oh, he shot the sheriff.

[01:13:42.620 --> 01:13:47.220]
He wants to read the brown word press for love.

[01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:52.040]
Oh, he shot the sheriff.

[01:13:53.280 --> 01:13:55.960]
Why did this ass-orgate a little bit?

[01:13:57.240 --> 01:13:58.780]
I just had a feeling I knew it.

[01:14:01.540 --> 01:14:03.680]
I knew sooner or later I'd have to hit that button.

[01:14:03.940 --> 01:14:05.000]
Yeah, that's life now.

[01:14:05.200 --> 01:14:06.420]
Oh, well, that's the way it goes.

[01:14:06.580 --> 01:14:07.060]
I told the sheriff.

[01:14:07.180 --> 01:14:07.300]
I told the sheriff.

[01:14:07.300 --> 01:14:07.560]
I told the sheriff.

[01:14:07.660 --> 01:14:07.880]
I told the sheriff.

[01:14:07.880 --> 01:14:09.540]
I told the sheriff.

[01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:16.060]
I told the sheriff.

[01:14:20.720 --> 01:14:21.580]
I told the sheriff.

[01:14:24.140 --> 01:14:24.800]
I told the sheriff.

[01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:24.800]

[01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:24.800]

[01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:24.800]

[01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:27.320]
I told the sheriff.

[01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:29.680]
I told the sheriff.

[01:14:29.820 --> 01:14:30.340]
I told the sheriff.

[01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:45.800]
I told the sheriff.

[01:14:53.720 --> 01:15:08.100]
The sheriff leaving for the shootingpping company.

[01:15:08.100 --> 01:15:08.860]
And the prisonaner didn't mean more than two years.

[01:15:08.900 --> 01:15:15.580]
The sheriff wanted some time for arresting.

[01:15:15.580 --> 01:15:19.300]
jenny sixty clean out his office on sunday and send a letter to governor charlie

[01:15:19.300 --> 01:15:23.500]
gay christ and the bs o our employees about his resignation today jenny couldn't

[01:15:23.500 --> 01:15:24.320]

a sticky bud ice cream sticky bun

[01:16:07.240 --> 01:16:12.480]

it's bad

[01:17:05.720 --> 01:17:10.540]

[01:17:10.540 --> 01:17:11.820]

[01:17:11.820 --> 01:17:12.480]

i should know that well i did know right off the bat

[01:17:32.980 --> 01:17:36.600]
did not tell me i hate to keep rehashing that as soon as he waddle through that door

[01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:37.780]
what i tell you about him

[01:17:37.780 --> 01:17:40.220]
you were late and i had a hander

[01:17:40.220 --> 01:17:43.020]
a glad hander a paper tiger

[01:17:43.020 --> 01:17:45.080]
okay i know he tried tiger

[01:17:45.080 --> 01:17:47.960]
right not a tiger with a circus although he fit in perfect there

[01:17:47.960 --> 01:17:49.540]
but a paper tiger

[01:17:49.540 --> 01:17:53.540]
i'm going to have it engraved in like a plaque on a plaque and send it to you

[01:17:54.260 --> 01:17:55.540]
you were right

[01:17:55.540 --> 01:17:56.900]
i will tell you

[01:17:56.900 --> 01:17:59.060]
i'm usually pretty good judge right off the bat

[01:17:59.060 --> 01:17:59.980]
you enjoy his case

[01:17:59.980 --> 01:18:02.840]

[01:18:02.840 --> 01:18:05.080]
oh my god is this a puss or what

[01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:05.760]
absolutely

[01:18:05.760 --> 01:18:06.440]
wow

[01:18:07.960 --> 01:18:09.000]

[01:18:09.960 --> 01:18:10.900]
yes sir

[01:18:10.900 --> 01:18:15.740]
i think joe bell pulled off one of the great sports talk radio trades of all time

[01:18:15.740 --> 01:18:16.460]
yeah

[01:18:16.460 --> 01:18:16.820]
joe

[01:18:16.820 --> 01:18:17.860]
yes

[01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:20.040]
what a deal

[01:18:20.040 --> 01:18:21.360]
but there's only one problem

[01:18:21.900 --> 01:18:22.080]
yes

[01:18:22.700 --> 01:18:25.020]
you have to take jimmy cephalo too

[01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:26.520]
jimmy cephalo

[01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:27.040]
oh

[01:18:28.940 --> 01:18:29.900]
absolutely comatote

[01:18:29.900 --> 01:18:32.300]
you know sir i was thinking this over the weekend

[01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:36.140]
the epitome of the south Florida market

[01:18:36.140 --> 01:18:39.660]
is the fact that jimmy cephalo is broadcasting the dolphin games

[01:18:39.660 --> 01:18:42.000]
and randy moor is going to be doing radio in the panther games

[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:43.760]
that tells you everything you need to know

[01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:44.980]
in other words bush league

[01:18:44.980 --> 01:18:46.500]
like i said 31 years ago

[01:18:46.500 --> 01:18:47.500]
bush league

[01:18:47.500 --> 01:18:51.320]
yeah but at least randy moor goes coast to coast like buttered toast

[01:18:51.320 --> 01:18:52.180]
yeah right

[01:18:53.340 --> 01:18:55.880]
and upstairs where grammar keeps the peanut butter

[01:18:55.880 --> 01:18:58.220]
yeah with he stole from rich generate right

[01:18:58.220 --> 01:19:00.100]
and he'll be dumping it in all all year

[01:19:00.100 --> 01:19:03.680]
and he'll be dump he'll be dumping all right believe me

[01:19:03.680 --> 01:19:07.140]
stealing all rich generate lines believe me rich generate is great and free

[01:19:07.140 --> 01:19:10.260]
to be a real life and go into it you know it's just it's just part and part

[01:19:10.260 --> 01:19:11.480]
for the course it fits right in

[01:19:12.180 --> 01:19:13.180]
with all the other swill

[01:19:14.060 --> 01:19:18.240]
five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the horizon singular wireless

wqa m hello

[01:19:28.180 --> 01:19:31.620]
yeah i don't know if your dump button is working

[01:19:31.620 --> 01:19:36.140]
because we heard ask and then the whole of the whole thing came out too

[01:19:36.700 --> 01:19:37.520]
yeah so

[01:19:37.520 --> 01:19:39.480]
well i thought that was a choice

[01:19:40.260 --> 01:19:42.440]
that you couldn't say one with the other

[01:19:42.440 --> 01:19:44.680]
we didn't you just dreamed it

[01:19:44.680 --> 01:19:45.860]
i don't think so nil

[01:19:45.860 --> 01:19:47.520]
now and what about it

[01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:51.420]
well i'm i'm not i'm not complaining well then then mind your own business

[01:19:51.420 --> 01:19:52.940]
okay move on get a life

[01:19:53.800 --> 01:19:54.680]
get a life

[01:19:54.680 --> 01:19:57.640]
who the hell knows if this things even connected for christseg

[01:19:57.640 --> 01:19:59.540]
i don't even know if it's even connected see

[01:19:59.540 --> 01:20:01.620]
you might want to keep your finger on it okay

[01:20:02.360 --> 01:20:05.720]
i because if they disconnected that would be the last person they bother telling

[01:20:05.720 --> 01:20:08.100]
clarence i'm going to tell you you are doing a job

[01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:11.180]
that is indescribable clearance dero

[01:20:12.840 --> 01:20:15.620]
i think handcash to answer you know how they said the

[01:20:16.380 --> 01:20:20.200]
carlo had an answer for sentino i think handcash to answer for a lot of these people

[01:20:20.200 --> 01:20:22.740]
clarence being one of them stucas being another one

[01:20:24.040 --> 01:20:28.120]
he's like dr frankenstein he invented these monsters and he can't get rid of them now

[01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:33.040]
but clarence i mean what you have got going on there

[01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:34.640]
and the thing with this production

[01:20:35.620 --> 01:20:39.600]
i mean do i really have to say it i mean anybody with an IQ larger than their thumbnail

[01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:43.040]
hasn't already perceived it in the first hour and 53 minutes of the show

[01:20:43.040 --> 01:20:44.640]
and probably long before this

[01:20:46.840 --> 01:20:50.480]
and he gives me a song and an answer but well this is something that just came up with the last minute

[01:20:50.480 --> 01:20:54.020]
like the other guy who used to do the other production which was okay he's he's alright

[01:20:55.200 --> 01:20:59.960]
they had a contract with him and his stuff evidently was up until September

[01:20:59.960 --> 01:21:02.120]
whatever the deal was you know and we can't play it anymore

[01:21:04.840 --> 01:21:08.380]
the id's and the rejoins and as well which is the sound of the radio station

[01:21:08.380 --> 01:21:11.660]
it's not that big of a deal people don't tune in to hear id's

[01:21:13.400 --> 01:21:15.460]
you think no they tune in to hear i does

[01:21:16.220 --> 01:21:18.080]
i don't that too

[01:21:19.660 --> 01:21:22.640]
but it just it just has a lot to do with the way the station sounds

[01:21:22.640 --> 01:21:27.020]
so anyway they got some other bozo who sounds like i said like we got him out of a dumpster somewhere

[01:21:27.020 --> 01:21:29.020]
with false teeth that he isn't wearing at the moment

[01:21:29.020 --> 01:21:30.900]
and he put together a bunch of crap

[01:21:30.900 --> 01:21:35.180]
and like oh well we don't have this and they don't end the right way

[01:21:35.180 --> 01:21:38.080]
you did a masterful job in putting this together clearance

[01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:41.140]
you knitwood you simple to and he still got a job

[01:21:41.140 --> 01:21:43.840]
that's the amazing part of it to me i just don't get it

[01:21:43.840 --> 01:21:47.360]
i just don't get it what does this man have to do?

[01:21:47.700 --> 01:21:53.360]
how low do those sports rating numbers have to get before somebody that building in a position of authority finally says

[01:21:53.360 --> 01:21:56.800]
i think there might be something wrong with his guy

[01:21:58.620 --> 01:22:02.340]
now when mufflers pd see those were the days when i said we were radio-ish

[01:22:02.340 --> 01:22:05.840]
because of at least is a broadcaster and he's been in radio for like a hundred years

[01:22:05.840 --> 01:22:09.580]
and worked like in real radio stations and stuff like that you know programming

[01:22:09.580 --> 01:22:11.860]
as opposed to just sniffing jockstrap

[01:22:11.860 --> 01:22:13.340]
although he probably would like that too

[01:22:15.100 --> 01:22:17.460]
don't you think that was like one of the major turning points?

[01:22:18.220 --> 01:22:18.340]
yeah

[01:22:18.340 --> 01:22:22.000]
when they shoved him upstairs into operations manager territory

[01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:22.940]
and they made clearance

[01:22:22.940 --> 01:22:24.800]
the first was the assistant program director

[01:22:24.800 --> 01:22:26.320]
then he stabbed the back

[01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:27.420]
he stabbed the

[01:22:27.420 --> 01:22:30.340]
he threw a ferry in the back and he became the pd

[01:22:30.340 --> 01:22:35.480]
and all of a sudden he was the he was the big cheese in the company

[01:22:35.920 --> 01:22:37.160]
as if he knew something

[01:22:38.340 --> 01:22:42.300]
the only thing he knows is where the hurricanes take a shower that's all he knows

[01:22:43.460 --> 01:22:44.780]
how many QA and hello?

[01:22:45.400 --> 01:22:45.680]

[01:22:56.020 --> 01:22:58.820]
Jo Kostell when whoever there was the other guy marking the dark

[01:22:59.320 --> 01:22:59.960]
I remember

[01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:02.220]
very good memory there Chris

[01:23:02.220 --> 01:23:03.680]
Chris remembers all the fat people

[01:23:05.620 --> 01:23:07.420]
Jo and Mark they miss Jo and Mark badly

[01:23:07.420 --> 01:23:09.180]
of course they've been off a long long time

[01:23:09.180 --> 01:23:11.760]
and it's serverly so I believe although that's your good friend Jo

[01:23:12.800 --> 01:23:14.260]
that you were a roller skating wooden

[01:23:14.260 --> 01:23:16.800]
what's the story he knocked you down on your ass and you broke your ass?

[01:23:17.040 --> 01:23:17.700]
sure one night

[01:23:18.100 --> 01:23:18.880]
let's make that happen

[01:23:18.880 --> 01:23:19.200]
let's make that happen

[01:23:19.200 --> 01:23:20.460]
when a doubt play but on him

[01:23:20.900 --> 01:23:21.940]
795 votes on the pool

[01:23:21.940 --> 01:23:23.460]
I think we can make 900 today

[01:23:23.460 --> 01:23:27.380]
on the 4th of September the day after Labor Day and then they will fear us

[01:23:27.380 --> 01:23:29.280]
not do you hear that?

[01:23:29.800 --> 01:23:30.600]
I heard it

[01:23:30.600 --> 01:23:32.200]
it's you all sound the audition line now

[01:23:32.200 --> 01:23:33.700]
I got so carried away

[01:23:34.620 --> 01:23:35.860]
this is the French quiz

[01:23:35.860 --> 01:23:37.380]
whenever I shape my ball

[01:23:37.380 --> 01:23:40.000]
I listen to the Neil Rogers 12-1 hour

[01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:43.740]
and the town where I was born

[01:23:44.580 --> 01:23:48.840]
lived a man named Howard Deans

[01:23:48.840 --> 01:23:52.540]
and he told us how we'd like

[01:23:52.540 --> 01:23:57.160]
to have a big George Bush defeat

[01:23:57.160 --> 01:24:01.040]
he emailed most everyone

[01:24:01.040 --> 01:24:03.940]
more endorsements

[01:24:03.940 --> 01:24:06.060]
so what he'd seen

[01:24:06.060 --> 01:24:09.900]
and he's really making way

[01:24:10.540 --> 01:24:14.880]
he's a fellow who's got big dreams

[01:24:15.540 --> 01:24:19.520]
we're all casting a vote for our team

[01:24:19.520 --> 01:24:21.740]
because we're meant to mean

[01:24:21.740 --> 01:24:23.660]
because it's a free

[01:24:24.380 --> 01:24:27.960]
we're all casting a vote for our team

[01:24:27.960 --> 01:24:30.300]
because we're meant to mean

[01:24:30.300 --> 01:24:32.960]
because it's a free boy

[01:24:44.220 --> 01:24:45.600]
it's a 12-2

[01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:47.760]
I thought maybe we'll play in 200 more of those

[01:24:47.760 --> 01:24:49.020]
I love that

[01:24:49.020 --> 01:24:50.920]
mad dog at the touchdown club

[01:24:50.920 --> 01:24:51.960]
today between 2 and 4

[01:24:51.960 --> 01:24:52.580]
whatever that is

[01:24:53.900 --> 01:24:55.240]
877 votes on the pool

[01:24:55.240 --> 01:24:56.960]
we might actually have a shot today Chris

[01:24:57.740 --> 01:24:59.740]
although I hear the rumors of the audience

[01:24:59.740 --> 01:25:00.640]
I hate you like poison

[01:25:00.640 --> 01:25:03.400]
they don't want to talk to me

[01:25:04.080 --> 01:25:05.740]
right now because there ain't no calls on there

[01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:08.080]
5667 0560

[01:25:08.080 --> 01:25:10.060]
and 0560 and the Verizon Singular

[01:25:10.760 --> 01:25:11.300]
wireless line

[01:25:13.040 --> 01:25:13.660]
I'll wait

[01:25:13.660 --> 01:25:15.100]
like I said before I'll wait

[01:25:15.100 --> 01:25:17.540]
in fact they better get them in between now and Friday

[01:25:17.540 --> 01:25:18.740]
because after Friday

[01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:21.200]
I'll get about it

[01:25:22.140 --> 01:25:22.900]
what do you think?

[01:25:23.380 --> 01:25:23.960]
forget about it

[01:25:23.960 --> 01:25:25.220]
that's what I always say

[01:25:25.220 --> 01:25:27.220]
I mean it's a lot of work but never less

[01:25:27.220 --> 01:25:29.660]
but when I do those shows

[01:25:29.660 --> 01:25:31.740]
you know when I'm sitting here in Rambling for four hours

[01:25:31.740 --> 01:25:33.880]
and to a clock I walk I walk a lot of here

[01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:34.500]
and I think to myself

[01:25:34.500 --> 01:25:35.500]
that was pretty good

[01:25:35.500 --> 01:25:35.920]
sure

[01:25:35.920 --> 01:25:38.560]
as opposed to WQI-N

[01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:38.820]
hello

[01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:41.600]
this is DJI's Kennedy

[01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:42.960]
as opposed to that

[01:25:42.960 --> 01:25:44.800]
if only you know it'd be learning

[01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:46.400]
thank you very much

[01:25:46.960 --> 01:25:47.800]
WQI-N hello

[01:25:49.860 --> 01:25:51.400]
that's why why you do this

[01:25:51.400 --> 01:25:53.520]
now under eye and Reverend Jones always sounds the same

[01:25:53.520 --> 01:25:53.940]
every time

[01:25:53.940 --> 01:25:56.000]
every time he sounds just like himself you know

[01:25:57.920 --> 01:25:58.960]
5667 0560

[01:25:58.960 --> 01:26:00.940]

hey thanks a lot for having Rick on last week

[01:26:08.340 --> 01:26:09.520]
I really enjoyed it

[01:26:09.520 --> 01:26:10.840]
you're the first person

[01:26:10.840 --> 01:26:11.740]
here it is new

[01:26:11.740 --> 01:26:13.340]
we've been on two hours today

[01:26:13.340 --> 01:26:16.140]
and you're the first person to make any comment on it

[01:26:16.140 --> 01:26:17.420]
that was the greatest thing

[01:26:17.420 --> 01:26:18.520]
I even pulled off the road

[01:26:18.520 --> 01:26:19.340]
and called some friends

[01:26:19.340 --> 01:26:20.340]
and said you got to listen

[01:26:20.340 --> 01:26:21.700]
Rick's back on QAM

[01:26:21.700 --> 01:26:22.440]
and that's the guy

[01:26:22.440 --> 01:26:23.260]
you better call off the road

[01:26:23.260 --> 01:26:24.560]
and call friends to listen every day

[01:26:24.560 --> 01:26:25.180]
because we need it

[01:26:25.180 --> 01:26:25.880]
believe me

[01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:27.840]
that's the guy I missed the most on QAM

[01:26:27.840 --> 01:26:28.760]
put him on the pole there

[01:26:28.760 --> 01:26:28.980]
Rick

[01:26:28.980 --> 01:26:30.000]

[01:26:31.020 --> 01:26:31.860]

[01:27:33.520 --> 01:27:34.580]
hey my friend

[01:27:34.580 --> 01:27:35.560]

[01:27:37.340 --> 01:27:38.480]
not too bad

[01:27:38.480 --> 01:27:39.900]
a couple of things I want to mention

[01:27:39.900 --> 01:27:40.820]
to you probably could keep

[01:27:40.820 --> 01:27:41.880]
trying some light on it

[01:27:41.880 --> 01:27:43.540]
the tell us on

[01:27:43.540 --> 01:27:45.660]
is anybody told that big man he's dead

[01:27:45.660 --> 01:27:46.800]
he died right after Johnny did

[01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:47.020]
anybody

[01:27:47.020 --> 01:27:48.420]
why did they tell him that man that

[01:27:48.420 --> 01:27:49.080]
oh it's a union

[01:27:50.020 --> 01:27:50.420]
and

[01:27:50.420 --> 01:27:51.620]

[01:27:51.620 --> 01:27:52.240]
another one

[01:27:52.240 --> 01:27:53.860]
I think the way he ended the show

[01:27:53.860 --> 01:27:54.640]
it felt like he's

[01:27:54.640 --> 01:27:56.360]
he's like he's never going to come back

[01:27:57.960 --> 01:27:58.640]
and you

[01:27:58.640 --> 01:27:59.240]
you be

[01:27:59.240 --> 01:27:59.960]
clear

[01:28:00.460 --> 01:28:01.700]
oh there we go

[01:28:02.260 --> 01:28:03.080]

[01:28:12.580 --> 01:28:13.100]

[01:28:16.300 --> 01:28:17.640]

5670560

[01:28:19.580 --> 01:28:20.880]
I think the poll

[01:28:20.880 --> 01:28:22.080]
associates in some way

[01:28:23.240 --> 01:28:24.400]
hello with crois on

[01:28:27.420 --> 01:28:28.320]
all that means is making

suicide watch

[01:28:50.380 --> 01:28:51.740]

[01:28:51.740 --> 01:28:52.280]

[01:29:06.760 --> 01:29:08.260]
with a pale and a shovel

[01:29:09.160 --> 01:29:10.020]

814 on the poll

[01:29:14.620 --> 01:29:15.280]
we're not going to make

[01:29:15.280 --> 01:29:16.120]

[01:29:16.120 --> 01:29:17.020]

[01:29:18.760 --> 01:29:19.820]
well that was a good

[01:29:19.820 --> 01:29:20.640]
call Chris

[01:29:20.640 --> 01:29:21.480]
even though the audience

[01:29:21.480 --> 01:29:22.340]
hates you like poison

[01:29:22.340 --> 01:29:23.160]

I've done a call

[01:31:19.020 --> 01:31:20.120]
about ten years ago

[01:31:20.120 --> 01:31:21.420]
I was wishing my friends

[01:31:21.420 --> 01:31:22.300]
were douchebags

[01:31:22.300 --> 01:31:22.940]

and said the D.B.s and so

[01:31:31.680 --> 01:31:32.000]
like that

[01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:32.760]

[01:31:32.760 --> 01:31:34.240]

how about you

[01:31:37.060 --> 01:31:37.180]

[01:31:37.180 --> 01:31:37.900]
I think you had a point

[01:31:37.900 --> 01:31:38.680]
about Monday

[01:31:40.560 --> 01:31:41.760]

I mean it would be nice

[01:31:43.740 --> 01:31:44.620]
it's a fantasy

[01:31:45.220 --> 01:31:46.260]
it would be nice what

[01:31:46.260 --> 01:31:47.020]
if we were to get

[01:31:47.020 --> 01:31:47.580]

[01:31:47.980 --> 01:31:48.380]
right

[01:31:49.020 --> 01:31:49.480]
how many years

[01:31:49.480 --> 01:31:50.700]
have we been doing this

[01:31:50.700 --> 01:31:51.280]

[01:31:52.440 --> 01:31:53.780]
this routine

[01:31:53.780 --> 01:31:54.940]
it's not going to change

[01:31:55.400 --> 01:31:56.460]
and that's why I

[01:31:56.460 --> 01:31:57.720]
tip my cats

[01:31:57.720 --> 01:31:58.500]

[01:31:58.500 --> 01:31:59.160]

[01:31:59.160 --> 01:32:00.200]
I would tip it to you

[01:32:00.200 --> 01:32:00.880]
because I don't know how

[01:32:00.880 --> 01:32:01.520]
you go through the whole

[01:32:01.520 --> 01:32:01.840]
summertime

[01:32:01.840 --> 01:32:03.300]

[01:32:06.020 --> 01:32:06.840]

[01:32:06.840 --> 01:32:08.040]
I grab people from the hallway

[01:32:08.040 --> 01:32:10.000]
and make the most of it

[01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:10.620]

last week

[01:33:02.560 --> 01:33:07.480]
I walked in the bathroom and I see two pair of feet under the straw.

[01:33:07.780 --> 01:33:08.160]
Sorry.

[01:33:08.620 --> 01:33:10.300]
And all I hear is seven set drop.

[01:33:10.860 --> 01:33:11.500]
Oh my!

[01:33:11.880 --> 01:33:12.420]
Oh my!

[01:33:15.620 --> 01:33:17.660]
Larry Craig and Kim Bo camper.

[01:33:18.460 --> 01:33:20.300]
Or maybe it was Ethan Skolik.

[01:33:21.020 --> 01:33:22.380]
Now, wait a minute, I thought there was more.

[01:33:23.460 --> 01:33:25.120]
Those are the football rejoins.

[01:33:25.200 --> 01:33:25.880]
They end that way.

[01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:27.140]
The other was at the dismay.

[01:33:27.960 --> 01:33:29.220]
You know, don't you have a chart?

[01:33:29.560 --> 01:33:30.300]
Give me a chart.

[01:33:30.300 --> 01:33:31.220]
Ah!

[01:33:31.780 --> 01:33:35.900]

Are you proud?

[01:33:48.940 --> 01:33:49.240]
Yeah.

[01:33:49.920 --> 01:33:51.100]
I'm a nauseous Skolik.

[01:33:51.520 --> 01:33:55.560]
I'm here to fight the by sports and bissions by smosing my way until what they call a

[01:33:55.560 --> 01:33:57.720]
grammar profession of which I do not belong.

[01:33:58.140 --> 01:33:59.780]
Oh, do come in.

[01:34:00.640 --> 01:34:02.300]
So, you like sports?

[01:34:02.800 --> 01:34:04.200]
Sports is all I think about.

[01:34:04.480 --> 01:34:09.180]
If they cloned Hitler and tamed me into a bar, so if I would request to be placed on the

[01:34:09.180 --> 01:34:10.520]
floor of the locker room.

[01:34:10.780 --> 01:34:11.260]
Good.

[01:34:11.920 --> 01:34:13.300]
You have been on the radio before?

[01:34:14.060 --> 01:34:14.760]
Uh-huh.

[01:34:15.180 --> 01:34:15.540]
Radio?

[01:34:15.940 --> 01:34:16.360]
What's that?

[01:34:16.760 --> 01:34:21.340]
Oh, you mean what you hear the nighttime games on mixed with Cuban chicken clocks?

[01:34:21.740 --> 01:34:25.480]
Oh, it's the thing you turn on that has sounds coming out of it.

[01:34:25.740 --> 01:34:26.480]
Oh sure.

[01:34:26.480 --> 01:34:32.580]
I already write a sports column for the fun technical all by myself with my anemic little

[01:34:32.580 --> 01:34:33.040]
fingers.

[01:34:33.540 --> 01:34:33.760]
Yeah.

[01:34:34.200 --> 01:34:39.640]
A manasha, we're looking for inexperienced wannabe talent that talk into a hairbrush in front

[01:34:39.640 --> 01:34:40.160]
of a mirror.

[01:34:40.660 --> 01:34:41.020]
Mm-hmm.

[01:34:41.280 --> 01:34:46.060]
Inadequate nebishes with no threshold for embarrassment and interested in nothing other than sports

[01:34:46.060 --> 01:34:48.800]
no matter how much revenue is lost for this station.

[01:34:49.320 --> 01:34:50.400]
Think you can handle it?

[01:34:50.680 --> 01:34:51.400]
Oh sure.

[01:34:51.400 --> 01:34:57.520]
I already write a sports column for the fun technical all by myself with my anemic little

[01:34:57.520 --> 01:34:58.020]
fingers.

[01:34:58.500 --> 01:34:58.960]
Mm-hmm.

[01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:00.420]
You like girls?

[01:35:00.980 --> 01:35:01.480]
How now?

[01:35:01.940 --> 01:35:03.460]
Girls intimidate me.

[01:35:03.860 --> 01:35:09.440]
Not that I'm gay, but I double my chances of having sex by talking manly sports with other

[01:35:09.440 --> 01:35:09.740]
men.

[01:35:10.300 --> 01:35:12.440]
You know, when you wink, yeah.

[01:35:12.900 --> 01:35:16.460]
That wink that's code for other sports sick of fan two.

[01:35:16.460 --> 01:35:22.900]
So when I like watching Polk on TV while holding your thing, well, looks like you might

[01:35:22.900 --> 01:35:26.040]
have an internship here with our fabulous sports team.

[01:35:26.180 --> 01:35:26.720]
Oh boy.

[01:35:27.260 --> 01:35:28.540]
Just one more thing.

[01:35:28.720 --> 01:35:30.720]
Yes, close that door behind you.

[01:35:30.940 --> 01:35:31.340]
Okay.

[01:35:31.740 --> 01:35:33.120]
Oh no, no, no, no.

[01:35:34.060 --> 01:35:36.660]
It's a 1217 and 560 WQM.

[01:35:36.960 --> 01:35:39.540]
We're doing screenless today on a Tuesday that day after Labor Day.

[01:35:40.840 --> 01:35:41.940]
832 votes on the pool.

[01:35:42.180 --> 01:35:44.780]
We might actually get close there to a thousand, you know what?

[01:35:45.500 --> 01:35:47.780]
We might like tickle the edges of it and the pool too.

[01:35:50.600 --> 01:35:54.380]
5607 0560, give those numbers loud and clear in a stentorian voice.

[01:35:54.540 --> 01:35:55.340]
Come on, you can do it.

[01:35:55.740 --> 01:35:58.360]
Tom 560 on the Verizon singular wireless line.

[01:35:59.220 --> 01:35:59.980]
WQM, hello.

[01:36:00.380 --> 01:36:01.620]
Yeah, what's the poll today?

[01:36:02.380 --> 01:36:02.960]
What's the poll?

[01:36:04.360 --> 01:36:05.100]
Check it.

[01:36:09.720 --> 01:36:13.680]
Five, six, seven, oh five last call for calls and then I'm going to spin some wax

[01:36:13.680 --> 01:36:14.140]
storage.

[01:36:14.840 --> 01:36:16.480]
Do it double dog dare you.

[01:36:16.720 --> 01:36:17.040]
I might.

[01:36:17.180 --> 01:36:18.780]
How about we play music?

[01:36:19.300 --> 01:36:20.640]
Not just today, I mean like every day.

[01:36:20.960 --> 01:36:21.220]
All right.

[01:36:21.720 --> 01:36:22.520]
But the good old days.

[01:36:23.140 --> 01:36:24.060]
Yeah, I'm going to.

[01:36:24.060 --> 01:36:25.220]
Yeah, we got them jingles.

[01:36:30.120 --> 01:36:30.880]
WQM, hello.

[01:36:35.800 --> 01:36:38.220]
Q I M. Hello.

[01:36:38.740 --> 01:36:39.060]
Yes.

[01:36:40.020 --> 01:36:41.520]
Yeah, I'd like to talk to Neil, please.

[01:36:41.520 --> 01:36:45.720]
Now if you turn the radio down, go ahead.

[01:36:47.700 --> 01:36:48.560]
Go ahead.

[01:36:49.180 --> 01:36:49.620]
Hello.

[01:36:50.120 --> 01:36:50.400]
Yes.

[01:36:51.320 --> 01:36:53.260]
Neil, Neil God speaking.

[01:36:54.120 --> 01:36:54.560]
Good Lord.

[01:36:54.800 --> 01:36:55.760]
It's a pleasure, Neil.

[01:36:56.280 --> 01:36:58.300]
Yeah, I was wondering if you could play a bit for me.

[01:36:59.020 --> 01:36:59.240]
No.

[01:37:00.980 --> 01:37:02.620]
5607 0560, pound 560.

[01:37:02.740 --> 01:37:04.580]
We want people to call who have something to say.

[01:37:04.900 --> 01:37:06.120]
Not who want to request a bit.

[01:37:06.440 --> 01:37:07.840]
Not who want to make a funny sound.

[01:37:07.840 --> 01:37:13.140]
Not who want to be on for the 85 million time just today, which means

[01:37:13.140 --> 01:37:14.000]
horn a lot of trouble.

[01:37:14.600 --> 01:37:16.280]
But here's a fact Nick from Boka.

[01:37:17.080 --> 01:37:20.180]
He says I've been listening to the show for almost 15 to my 29 years.

[01:37:20.240 --> 01:37:23.500]
I'm a passionate fan and it best I'm ambivalent about the colors.

[01:37:24.320 --> 01:37:27.240]
Sometimes I find it entertaining only because of your ability to deal with

[01:37:27.240 --> 01:37:27.660]
these ideas.

[01:37:28.060 --> 01:37:31.000]
Other times like Joyce, it blows in the past.

[01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:34.160]
You protested the bad colors by spending months reading bedtime stories.

[01:37:34.160 --> 01:37:39.780]
I think you'd make the remainder of your contract period more fulfilling by strong

[01:37:39.780 --> 01:37:41.360]
arming management with this technique.

[01:37:42.120 --> 01:37:45.240]
The dream team managing the station clearly wants you to take calls.

[01:37:45.520 --> 01:37:46.860]
But you know what screw them Nick?

[01:37:47.540 --> 01:37:48.300]
The dream team.

[01:37:48.560 --> 01:37:49.640]
It's not the dream team.

[01:37:49.760 --> 01:37:50.800]
It's the nightmare team.

[01:37:51.940 --> 01:37:55.020]
Why don't you stop taking calls until management starts promoting the show?

[01:37:56.600 --> 01:38:00.040]
I'm sure that if you set up a poll on the site asking listeners how long they've been

[01:38:00.040 --> 01:38:03.020]
listening to the show, you'll find most of your listeners have been with you for a while.

[01:38:03.460 --> 01:38:06.960]
Demonstrate to the management dream team that you want new listeners more growth than

[01:38:06.960 --> 01:38:08.320]
only then when you take calls.

[01:38:08.460 --> 01:38:10.000]
Boy Nick, you're in a dream world.

[01:38:10.440 --> 01:38:14.040]
If they've bought from promoting a non-sport show, why don't they let you know that once

[01:38:14.040 --> 01:38:17.800]
you let them know that plenty of your fans have become fans of Hank and Maddige because

[01:38:17.800 --> 01:38:18.360]
of your show.

[01:38:18.760 --> 01:38:22.120]
I'm not a sports hall but I enjoy these shows wasn't your station all day because of

[01:38:22.120 --> 01:38:22.380]
you.

[01:38:22.820 --> 01:38:24.080]
Gives you a drop-spack while you're at it.

[01:38:24.160 --> 01:38:26.080]
Maybe send Connie to give Joyce a canole.

[01:38:26.740 --> 01:38:27.720]
Says Nick from Boka.

[01:38:29.080 --> 01:38:29.900]
Oh you eat it.

[01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:30.680]
You're so skinny.

[01:38:30.680 --> 01:38:32.780]
I love that scene.

[01:38:32.980 --> 01:38:35.900]
She kind of like just on the edges.

[01:38:36.120 --> 01:38:37.560]
You know she like tipped toes around the edges.

[01:38:37.720 --> 01:38:39.180]
Yeah I wouldn't have bought that.

[01:38:40.560 --> 01:38:41.620]
You wouldn't have bought what?

[01:38:41.840 --> 01:38:42.820]
That canole for a dollar.

[01:38:42.880 --> 01:38:44.080]
Well it was Eli Waller.

[01:38:44.140 --> 01:38:46.280]
He was concentrating on that spin-a in his shoe.

[01:38:46.440 --> 01:38:50.080]
I say 38 votes and maybe it was a spin-a in his spectrum.

[01:38:51.060 --> 01:38:51.820]
Dominic Q.I.M.

[01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:52.060]
Hello.

[01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:53.380]
Yes.

[01:38:53.740 --> 01:38:54.640]
I'd like to explain the bad.

[01:38:54.640 --> 01:39:00.300]
And don't you care from 1967 on WQM.

[01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:02.840]
Yes.

[01:39:03.280 --> 01:39:05.120]
I'm George Boy from fabulous Jones.

[01:39:05.320 --> 01:39:05.660]
He's very.

[01:39:06.740 --> 01:39:07.440]
Dominic Q.I.M.

[01:39:07.620 --> 01:39:07.680]
Hello.

[01:39:08.360 --> 01:39:08.920]
Hey me.

[01:39:09.020 --> 01:39:09.840]
I got something to say.

[01:39:10.200 --> 01:39:10.460]
Yes.

[01:39:11.380 --> 01:39:12.180]
How you doing?

[01:39:13.900 --> 01:39:14.340]
And?

[01:39:14.840 --> 01:39:15.260]
Oh I'm sorry.

[01:39:15.600 --> 01:39:16.300]
It was gone from it.

[01:39:17.020 --> 01:39:18.660]
I'm on a diet rest.

[01:39:19.100 --> 01:39:20.620]
A lot of it but that's not my point.

[01:39:20.800 --> 01:39:22.240]
I went into a restaurant and plantation.

[01:39:22.240 --> 01:39:24.220]
I've never seen anything like it.

[01:39:24.440 --> 01:39:24.880]
Unbelievable.

[01:39:25.180 --> 01:39:26.800]
It's all cereal.

[01:39:27.320 --> 01:39:28.320]
70 cereal.

[01:39:28.420 --> 01:39:28.940]
It's gorgeous.

[01:39:29.120 --> 01:39:29.600]
Toppies.

[01:39:29.740 --> 01:39:30.500]
Unbelievable man.

[01:39:30.900 --> 01:39:33.600]
I said wow what a concept called the cereal connection.

[01:39:34.220 --> 01:39:34.740]
Implantation.

[01:39:35.100 --> 01:39:38.320]
I hope they give you a free food and you know choke on it.

[01:39:39.120 --> 01:39:40.160]
567.0560.

[01:39:40.380 --> 01:39:42.900]
Pound 560 and they were rising in singular wireless line.

[01:39:43.540 --> 01:39:44.240]
Dominic Q.I.M.

[01:39:44.380 --> 01:39:44.480]
Hello.

[01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:45.920]
Good morning Neil.

[01:39:46.420 --> 01:39:46.720]
Yes sir.

[01:39:46.840 --> 01:39:49.240]
I would actually like to offer you some things.

[01:39:49.240 --> 01:39:53.200]
I've been taking advantage of the Neil's deals bargains on your on the

[01:39:53.200 --> 01:39:54.040]
joy on website.

[01:39:54.340 --> 01:39:54.740]
Yeah.

[01:39:55.060 --> 01:39:58.720]
Anybody who hasn't yet made it out to cap the Bell with Sarah man you don't know what you're missing.

[01:39:59.340 --> 01:39:59.620]
Okay.

[01:39:59.980 --> 01:40:04.320]
I've been on that for just about I think about the last three or four ones that you've offered I jumped on and

[01:40:04.920 --> 01:40:05.720]
that's a good stuff.

[01:40:05.900 --> 01:40:10.560]
So amongst all the fault are all here just say word of thanks to making that off the course and I'm going to keep on buying.

[01:40:10.840 --> 01:40:11.180]
Excellent.

[01:40:11.320 --> 01:40:11.960]
Okay thanks pal.

[01:40:12.080 --> 01:40:12.560]
I know.

[01:40:13.260 --> 01:40:16.520]
Okay there's a little something I got at the sound of someone coherent.

[01:40:18.060 --> 01:40:18.940]
838 in a pool.

[01:40:19.100 --> 01:40:21.740]
Can we make 900 this out what do you think no huh?

[01:40:24.140 --> 01:40:29.520]
No they're not calling because they're busy voting on the pool over and over and over and over all 10 of them.

[01:40:30.520 --> 01:40:31.540]
WDQ.Y.M. Hello.

[01:40:32.500 --> 01:40:36.940]
It's the Buckingham's on Tiger IO WQ.M.

[01:40:37.860 --> 01:40:38.860]
WDQ.Y.M. Hello.

[01:40:40.100 --> 01:40:40.760]
Hi Neil.

[01:40:41.260 --> 01:40:41.440]
Yes.

[01:40:41.820 --> 01:40:42.980]
Hey Gatel. How you doing?

[01:40:42.980 --> 01:40:43.600]
Okay.

[01:40:44.860 --> 01:40:45.940]
You've been to Montreal.

[01:40:46.780 --> 01:40:46.980]
Yes.

[01:40:47.340 --> 01:40:48.520]
Have you ever tried two teams?

[01:40:49.580 --> 01:40:50.300]
I beg your pardon?

[01:40:50.760 --> 01:40:53.740]
It's the French fries with the gravy and the cheese.

[01:40:53.740 --> 01:40:54.620]
Oh geez.

[01:40:54.880 --> 01:40:55.400]
Get out of here.

[01:40:55.520 --> 01:40:55.720]
Yeah.

[01:40:57.740 --> 01:40:57.740]

[01:40:59.080 --> 01:41:00.460]
I know what he's talking about too.

[01:41:00.520 --> 01:41:01.000]
That's true.

[01:41:01.100 --> 01:41:02.520]
They have like brown gravy.

[01:41:02.940 --> 01:41:05.640]
I'm always suspicious when the gravy is that color.

[01:41:06.140 --> 01:41:06.240]
What?

[01:41:06.360 --> 01:41:07.760]
That shade of brown.

[01:41:08.020 --> 01:41:08.620]
Oh that shade.

[01:41:09.600 --> 01:41:10.180]
Night shade.

[01:41:10.740 --> 01:41:12.260]
Like the danger is night shade.

[01:41:13.200 --> 01:41:14.580]
WDQ.Y.M. Hello.

[01:41:14.940 --> 01:41:16.680]
That was the honor of the serial connection.

[01:41:17.100 --> 01:41:17.820]
I'm having his call.

[01:41:17.840 --> 01:41:18.440]
Okay good.

[01:41:18.760 --> 01:41:19.280]
Screw him.

[01:41:20.240 --> 01:41:21.180]
WDQ.Y.M. Hello.

[01:41:22.460 --> 01:41:22.900]
Hello.

[01:41:23.360 --> 01:41:23.680]
Yes.

[01:41:23.780 --> 01:41:25.500]
I'd like to get on the Neil Rogers program.

I must have been dreaming.

[01:41:50.280 --> 01:41:51.920]
Yeah, you must have had a bad dream sir.

[01:41:52.060 --> 01:41:53.100]
There's no more Rosalind Park.

[01:41:53.280 --> 01:41:53.860]
It's condominium.

[01:41:54.100 --> 01:41:54.880]

Scott for REL209. DFO 178. Boy maybe we can pick him up for a song you know it because I just

[01:43:39.460 --> 01:43:47.260]
I miss those two his two favorite cliches. Living large and mailing it in. Oh God I miss hearing him say those.

[01:43:48.340 --> 01:43:52.560]
I get sexual excitement just thinking about DFO's talking about living large.

[01:43:53.520 --> 01:44:01.660]
Mojauer David at 170. None to be above is climbing rapidly 139. Geldy pretty weak 75. Nice pick

[01:44:07.640 --> 01:44:13.140]
station or what? Ron Hersey 9. Mark Eisenberg won in Joe Castellan. Why did we why did we put them

[01:44:13.140 --> 01:44:18.680]
on separate? Because I can put them together. No no that's fine. Mark Eisenberg's got one and

[01:44:18.680 --> 01:44:23.400]
poor Joe has the big O. He's no fact in the church.

[01:44:52.620 --> 01:44:59.920]
I want to go to a liquor store but a guy there talks real fun. I asked him for a pint of

[01:45:59.140 --> 01:46:04.820]
going to have something. I don't know if we're going to have any more what 950 I don't think

[01:46:04.820 --> 01:46:08.260]
we're going to have any more calls though I think we've exhausted the tremendous you know

[01:46:08.260 --> 01:46:11.500]
it's it's the day after Labor Day what do you expect and you want me to make a judgment

[01:46:11.500 --> 01:46:15.480]
I'm going to do next week based on this today. Well you're not good no I don't want you to do

[01:46:15.480 --> 01:46:19.120]

[01:46:30.440 --> 01:46:34.120]
the Joe Rosen what's his name show. I don't know what the guy's name is.

[01:46:37.340 --> 01:46:41.520]
Jason Jackson why can't I remember that I never heard him before. He sounded okay he sounded

[01:46:41.520 --> 01:46:45.380]
pretty good but he kept talking at the same time as Joe and now if you have stereo which we do

[01:46:45.380 --> 01:46:49.440]
broadcast and stereo that's good because you hear each one amount of a different channel and they

[01:46:49.440 --> 01:46:55.140]
can both do a live spot at the same time they could double up and that sound good. And then we

[01:46:55.140 --> 01:46:59.440]
got a 40 live live we can get Orlando's wife to cut a couple of live spots we could put in there too

[01:46:59.440 --> 01:47:09.320]

[01:48:27.880 --> 01:48:34.120]
again. Make it perfect. Here like when you were saying the death sentence on the station they

[01:48:34.120 --> 01:48:39.300]
destroyed it. What would be make it better. What would make it better is if they let us do anything

[01:48:39.300 --> 01:48:43.960]
that would be a start and number two if the then if the if the formatics of this station were like a

[01:48:43.960 --> 01:48:48.200]
real place where people could listen instead of being invited to tune out. Where would they

[01:48:48.200 --> 01:48:52.560]
like to get rid of I mean in other words management the whole time management then that's correct.

[01:48:54.380 --> 01:48:59.180]
Enjoy. Enjoy. What is it? Who enjoys who exactly is this woman. A bitch.

[01:48:59.600 --> 01:49:05.220]
At the one's application I mean what can we do to get her out of her position. Can we all

[01:49:05.220 --> 01:49:10.300]
not protest what can we do. What can we do. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.

[01:49:10.380 --> 01:49:15.200]
This is what you can do. Get a life. 870 votes on the pool. What can we do to make the station

[01:49:15.200 --> 01:49:20.680]
perfect again Neil. What can we do. Perfect my ass. We've got a bunch of perfect idiots running

[01:49:20.680 --> 01:49:27.540]
to them. I mean just pathetic tragic. Oh when you can't say this enjoy says you can't do that

[01:49:27.540 --> 01:49:36.120]
because we're going to get fined and we're oh jeez. Oh my god. Oh WQ I am hello.

[01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:43.520]
Oh yes. Yeah I want to talk Neil. Speaking. Hello Neil. Yes.

[01:49:44.380 --> 01:49:49.560]
Hey Neil long time and thought you said my daughter Katie Swini was aboard the flat.

[01:49:50.500 --> 01:49:55.680]
You did a new deal about Tropical Park turning into off campus stadium for the hurricanes.

[01:49:57.520 --> 01:50:02.140]
Off campus stadium for the hurricanes what are you talking about. Yeah they're going to

[01:50:02.760 --> 01:50:07.840]
they're going to look into taking care of this partial land out there off of Bird Road Tropical Park.

[01:50:08.040 --> 01:50:12.040]
The hurricanes are moving to Dolphin Stadium sir. Yeah they've got to leave but

[01:50:12.900 --> 01:50:16.580]
after that they're going to they're actually going to tear all that down and put the off site.

[01:50:16.820 --> 01:50:20.740]
Well that would be almost as brilliant as building the arena for the basketball team that

[01:50:20.740 --> 01:50:25.120]
that's empty all the time. That would be good. I still say let's build a arena on every street

[01:50:25.120 --> 01:50:29.960]
corner. What do you say? All right because there could be a lot of homeless people out there.

[01:50:29.960 --> 01:50:33.540]
All these four closures you know we can put them on the arenas. What does that sound like?

[01:50:33.760 --> 01:50:38.800]
How about Kelly arena? Who? Eight seventy out boy that Gordon Brown the new prime minister

[01:50:38.800 --> 01:50:42.700]
and Britain airfait he don't look like the if he's the epitome of the constipated Brit

[01:50:43.720 --> 01:50:48.340]
who could use a real good Schmidt. I mean he is the most constipated looking human being.

[01:50:48.480 --> 01:50:51.720]
I've ever seen in my life. He's got that you know the look I'm talking about. Mm-hmm.

[01:50:53.140 --> 01:50:57.000]
He hasn't been near the bowl in 20 years. Somebody QAM hello.

[01:50:57.880 --> 01:51:06.020]
I love South Florida. I love you too. Yeah. We don't care. WQAM hello.

[01:51:06.740 --> 01:51:13.000]
I got two things G. Dog. First thing is that you left a name off the list. Your name should be

[01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:17.720]
on there because we miss you ever since Joyce came around and two. Can you put me on hold for

[01:51:20.100 --> 01:51:24.580]
a while? Yeah you sound like you're right up his alley baby. You sound like you got you're

[01:51:24.580 --> 01:51:29.740]
right in that line of humor. Now how about for the fake Dan LaBashtra how's that sound?

[01:51:30.760 --> 01:51:33.960]
There's a fake fake stuff over there. The fake one they got the fake hand gold brewer the

[01:51:33.960 --> 01:51:40.080]
fakes you've managed to fake everybody on the fake sports station with a fake general manager.

[01:51:40.080 --> 01:51:44.980]
The Riddians dumb ass dirt. Absolutely.

[01:51:49.440 --> 01:51:57.260]
They do like Target and other guys are usually pited from what they realize. They what they're

[01:51:57.260 --> 01:52:04.780]
knows in a happily excited. You know John's right. Welcome. What's like it's more

[01:52:04.780 --> 01:52:11.180]
cold. I'm still there. By talking about sports while drinking up beers they desire

[01:52:11.180 --> 01:52:16.060]
of course to be a self-discipline. We're so kind of jobstrap.

[01:52:18.180 --> 01:52:26.740]
Yeah. No jobstrap. Yeah. No jobstrap. We're what you hear. Sports all day. Yeah. No jobstrap.

[01:52:27.220 --> 01:52:34.060]
Yeah. No jobstrap. The money figure is a bit liabley gay. Anyone who wants to hear

[01:52:34.060 --> 01:52:39.260]
just sports will sink in day. His dream is like a rock and roll. Go to the shop and spray.

[01:52:39.860 --> 01:52:41.120]
Who's got no jobstrap?

[01:52:42.900 --> 01:52:46.120]
Hey how about for dogmas what a gay made play?

[01:52:46.740 --> 01:52:52.260]
And somebody's kid with the herding canes. He's talking about it all the time and she will

[01:52:52.260 --> 01:53:01.320]
beg it. I'm afraid you like you know jobstrap. Shooting and burning out forning shows. No

[01:53:01.320 --> 01:53:07.560]
interest in learnings out radio. Just the sausage party for a new sport all the

[01:53:07.560 --> 01:53:09.720]
most who like yellow jobs.

[01:53:11.700 --> 01:53:13.280]
Yellow jobs.

[01:53:14.040 --> 01:53:14.920]
Yellow jobs.

[01:53:15.260 --> 01:53:18.780]
Sports holes is these who all in out.

[01:53:19.360 --> 01:53:20.440]
Yellow jobs.

[01:53:20.940 --> 01:53:22.180]
Yellow jobs.

[01:53:22.660 --> 01:53:26.120]
They're on your mind to be in your mouth.

[01:53:26.660 --> 01:53:28.080]
Sports. Sports. Sports.

[01:53:28.080 --> 01:53:32.780]
Sports. Sports. Sports. Sports. Sports. Sports. Sports.

[01:53:33.820 --> 01:53:34.940]
Sports all day.

[01:53:35.740 --> 01:53:36.620]
Sports all day.

[01:53:37.460 --> 01:53:38.640]
Sports all day.

[01:53:39.420 --> 01:53:39.940]
Thank you.

[01:53:40.720 --> 01:53:42.080]
Sports all day.

[01:53:43.020 --> 01:53:43.500]
Thank you.

[01:53:43.720 --> 01:53:46.940]
Hey guess what we're going to do on that poll today Chris we're going to do a thousand votes.

[01:53:46.940 --> 01:53:50.120]
You'll see eight ninety seven on there right now as I speak. We're going to do it on the

[01:53:50.120 --> 01:53:55.220]
fourth of September on a day I wouldn't wish on a Heinrich Himmler with this audience.

[01:53:55.220 --> 01:53:59.300]
But you know what I got a really good column here by Richard Kim was on our website a few

[01:53:59.300 --> 01:54:04.180]
days ago the GOP's bathroom problem after the bomb Allen and Laurie Craig and all these

[01:54:05.100 --> 01:54:08.740]
phony fascists but nevertheless I'm not going to read it though because that would take

[01:54:08.740 --> 01:54:12.420]
time up for the calls five six seven oh five sixty.

[01:54:14.460 --> 01:54:17.500]
Count five sixty on the Verizon and singular wireless line.

[01:54:17.660 --> 01:54:18.960]
Which is it would be a bad mistake.

[01:54:19.780 --> 01:54:20.180]
Okay.

[01:54:21.400 --> 01:54:25.020]
And the thing I think a bad mistake Joe Costello every time he do a poll he gets

[01:54:25.020 --> 01:54:28.840]
involved in he he gets on the revolts for himself like a hundred times.

[01:54:28.980 --> 01:54:29.180]
Okay.

[01:54:29.360 --> 01:54:31.260]
He went he went from no votes to twenty one.

[01:54:32.180 --> 01:54:34.080]
Now you know that's not possible right.

[01:54:34.460 --> 01:54:36.960]
Oh he was a very popular guy was he I don't know.

[01:54:37.960 --> 01:54:41.460]
He went from no votes to twenty one I like him.

[01:54:41.540 --> 01:54:46.260]
I don't like him but I mean it seems a little fishy to me you know.

[01:54:46.960 --> 01:54:50.300]
You always had a little bit of me goes he's still doing that thing on XN.

[01:54:51.100 --> 01:54:52.240]
Yes yes he is.

[01:54:52.900 --> 01:54:54.280]

[01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:55.460]
I'm going to be really depressed and I might just change my whole mind about coming back to the full schedule next week.

[01:55:55.780 --> 01:55:59.080]
And just work like on Wednesday sounds good to me for a couple hours.

[01:56:00.360 --> 01:56:02.180]

[01:56:02.740 --> 01:56:04.400]

[01:56:04.960 --> 01:56:07.180]
Yeah right yesterday was a real bananza.

[01:56:07.240 --> 01:56:09.520]
Can you imagine if you would have had to work the whole four hours yesterday.

[01:56:09.700 --> 01:56:11.060]
I would rather not imagine.

[01:56:11.060 --> 01:56:12.760]
Nobody Q a M hello.

[01:56:13.220 --> 01:56:13.860]

See at least he makes the phone ring.

[01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:24.080]
I'm not going to say it's something good.

[01:56:24.200 --> 01:56:29.260]
It's something evil and horrendous and they're at least it's like a connection with the subhuman race.

[01:56:29.580 --> 01:56:30.260]
It's something.

[01:56:31.240 --> 01:56:37.320]
He says he cares enough to send is very worse as opposed to most of you folks who don't care enough to a little at your phone you know.

I could do the whole last hour just just go to go off on Joe Bell.

[01:56:54.820 --> 01:56:55.960]
And what a fool he is.

[01:56:56.160 --> 01:56:57.520]
I might just do it you know.

[01:56:58.100 --> 01:56:59.960]

I'll be like like 15 years ago to ask you to play the card for the bird.

[01:59:09.920 --> 01:59:11.040]
I was wondering if you can do that again.

[01:59:11.140 --> 01:59:13.080]
That's the best thing I've ever heard on the radio ever.

[01:59:13.860 --> 01:59:15.080]
Can you play for the bird?

[01:59:15.240 --> 01:59:15.800]

Why did you call me?

[01:59:48.420 --> 01:59:49.180]
I didn't call you.

[01:59:49.180 --> 01:59:53.340]
You're not just to tell you not to say anything just play something.

[01:59:54.140 --> 01:59:55.980]
Oh god can't stand it.

[01:59:56.260 --> 01:59:57.360]
Well then why are you listening?

[01:59:57.440 --> 01:59:59.160]

You won't see he won't talk to me.

[02:00:03.980 --> 02:00:04.760]
Oh we got a card.

[02:00:04.900 --> 02:00:05.900]
Not now he won't.

[02:00:05.900 --> 02:00:07.880]
See I had to bleep that odd which I didn't drink.

[02:00:07.880 --> 02:00:08.060]
Sure.

[02:00:08.120 --> 02:00:11.000]
Poorly there but nonetheless he said do she box or something like that or bag.

[02:00:12.120 --> 02:00:14.240]
913 votes on the poll though they're coming along now.

[02:00:14.320 --> 02:00:16.760]
We're going to make that thousand and Chris is going to eat his words baby.

[02:00:17.160 --> 02:00:17.320]
Yeah.

[02:00:17.920 --> 02:00:19.680]
A lot of carbs in those words.

[02:00:20.320 --> 02:00:23.620]
Well I ain't that strawberry cheesecake ice cream and why did I do that?

[02:00:25.340 --> 02:00:26.580]
Ben and Jerry had it.

[02:00:27.140 --> 02:00:30.080]
I'm on my digit ice cream I would stick to the sugar no question about that.

[02:00:30.800 --> 02:00:32.420]
But Ben and Jerry's blows.

[02:00:33.160 --> 02:00:35.560]
There's something that used to be great just like QAM.

[02:00:35.800 --> 02:00:40.460]
Used to be great and now certain people have taken over like QAM and they've destroyed it.

[02:00:40.480 --> 02:00:41.360]
They've butchered it.

[02:00:41.560 --> 02:00:42.620]
They've strangled it.

[02:00:42.820 --> 02:00:44.100]
They've emasculated it.

[02:00:44.180 --> 02:00:45.580]
They've cut the balls off it.

[02:00:45.580 --> 02:00:46.420]
You know what I'm saying that suck.

[02:00:47.180 --> 02:00:47.840]

[02:00:55.260 --> 02:00:57.520]
Serial ball more like turlitt ball.

[02:00:58.040 --> 02:00:58.280]

[02:00:59.360 --> 02:00:59.400]
Thank you.

[02:01:02.100 --> 02:01:02.600]
Oh.

[02:01:03.040 --> 02:01:05.380]
Maybe we could take Gordon Brown over there okay.

[02:01:05.840 --> 02:01:08.020]
For a brown spot or two of T.

[02:01:08.520 --> 02:01:09.180]
WQA M.

[02:01:09.260 --> 02:01:09.360]

[02:01:10.420 --> 02:01:11.040]
QA M.

[02:01:11.100 --> 02:01:11.200]
Hola.

[02:01:12.920 --> 02:01:14.040]
I don't know you.

[02:01:14.040 --> 02:01:14.720]
Yes.

[02:01:15.180 --> 02:01:15.720]
Hey.

[02:01:16.160 --> 02:01:19.060]
I listened there Thursday with Gordon.

[02:01:19.300 --> 02:01:22.780]
Great interest with Rick on the on the Earth you.

[02:01:23.300 --> 02:01:23.420]
Yeah.

[02:01:23.440 --> 02:01:24.840]
I called George about it Friday.

[02:01:25.600 --> 02:01:29.940]
That was just the most exceptional radio I've heard in years.

[02:01:30.720 --> 02:01:35.720]
Well you're the second car I've had about it in three hours today so it must have been really a really impact.

[02:01:36.320 --> 02:01:43.480]
I grew up with him on QAM and the only other station that gave him any competition was a 790 WFUN.

[02:01:43.480 --> 02:01:44.140]
Right.

[02:01:44.620 --> 02:01:45.160]
Back then.

[02:01:46.040 --> 02:01:50.120]
I tried to call Friday while it was on because I wanted to ask you a question.

[02:01:50.640 --> 02:01:52.760]
He told us how he got the name Rick Shaw.

[02:01:52.900 --> 02:01:54.420]
How did you get the name, your orders?

[02:01:54.760 --> 02:01:55.880]
Because my middle name is Roger.

[02:01:56.060 --> 02:01:56.480]
I made it up.

[02:01:57.220 --> 02:01:59.480]
And you just made Nelson to Neil huh?

[02:01:59.780 --> 02:01:59.980]
Yeah.

[02:02:00.220 --> 02:02:00.620]
You got it.

[02:02:01.140 --> 02:02:03.380]
I thought it would be an interesting story.

[02:02:03.640 --> 02:02:04.040]
But it's not.

[02:02:04.160 --> 02:02:05.020]
That's why I never told it.

[02:02:06.040 --> 02:02:06.320]
Okay.

[02:02:06.820 --> 02:02:07.380]
Have a great day.

[02:02:07.540 --> 02:02:07.720]
Have a great day.

[02:02:08.120 --> 02:02:08.360]
Okay.

[02:02:09.180 --> 02:02:10.060]
Look at this.

[02:02:10.500 --> 02:02:11.340]
Oh, a nugget.

[02:02:11.340 --> 02:02:12.720]
I thought it was going to say NAND Tucket.

[02:02:13.040 --> 02:02:13.600]
You can't say NAND.

[02:02:13.700 --> 02:02:14.220]
Can we say that?

[02:02:14.500 --> 02:02:14.660]
No.

[02:02:14.900 --> 02:02:15.780]
NAND Tucket.

[02:02:15.780 --> 02:02:16.720]
NAND Tuck Connecticut.

[02:02:16.860 --> 02:02:19.140]
A Roman Catholic priest was arrested Thursday.

[02:02:19.560 --> 02:02:20.500]
Oh, this is the last week.

[02:02:20.700 --> 02:02:22.380]
On a sexual assault charge involving a child.

[02:02:22.720 --> 02:02:24.300]
Then suspended by church officials.

[02:02:24.460 --> 02:02:25.000]
How do you like that?

[02:02:25.060 --> 02:02:25.440]
Oh my God.

[02:02:25.900 --> 02:02:30.840]
The Reverend Robert J. Grant 63 was taken into custody last Thursday morning later released on 200 grand bond.

[02:02:31.060 --> 02:02:32.960]
Sent police chief Christopher Edson.

[02:02:33.520 --> 02:02:37.420]
Edson said Grant was charged with secondary sexual assault and risk of injury to a minor.

[02:02:37.420 --> 02:02:40.440]
The chief said he couldn't elaborate because he liked victimism juvenile.

[02:02:41.100 --> 02:02:44.660]
Grant is passed over the same Mary and St. Henry churches in NAND Tuck Connecticut.

[02:02:45.400 --> 02:02:48.760]
A spokesman for the Arts Dicees of Hartford, which oversees NAND Tucked Persians, says,

[02:02:49.080 --> 02:02:50.920]
Grant has been placed on administrative leave.

[02:02:51.360 --> 02:02:55.240]
We are deeply troubled by this morning's arrest of father Grant said the Reverend John Gatsack

[02:02:55.240 --> 02:02:56.420]
spokesman for the Arts Dicees.

[02:02:57.280 --> 02:03:00.540]
He won't be able to do ministry or function as a priest pending the outcome of the investigation.

[02:03:01.300 --> 02:03:02.780]
The Reverend was noted for...

[02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:05.240]
Oh, no.

[02:03:05.240 --> 02:03:08.840]
The Reverend was noted for his sock puppet plays at the school.

[02:03:10.720 --> 02:03:11.920]
He's there by some people.

[02:03:12.240 --> 02:03:14.200]
And your pants Johnny, you're just happy to see me.

[02:03:15.380 --> 02:03:16.480]
Oh my God.

[02:03:16.680 --> 02:03:20.200]
The Arts Dicees has taken several steps in recent use to safeguard children Gatsack.

[02:03:20.200 --> 02:03:22.840]
Said, however, they are not receiving positive results.

[02:03:24.200 --> 02:03:27.800]
He said every priest and employee works with children and goes through all background checks,

[02:03:28.140 --> 02:03:32.180]
as well as a mandatory program for recognizing the signs of sexual abuse, but a beep but a boop but a bob.

[02:03:32.180 --> 02:03:33.120]
And said, we're in so on.

[02:03:34.540 --> 02:03:35.300]
How do you like that?

[02:03:35.800 --> 02:03:36.620]
Not another one of those.

[02:03:36.760 --> 02:03:38.340]
Just another isolated incident, I'm sure.

[02:03:40.400 --> 02:03:40.980]
917 votes.

[02:03:41.120 --> 02:03:43.440]
Just a piss off, Chris, we're going to get to 1,000 votes today.

[02:03:44.060 --> 02:03:45.320]
It's on a day from Hill.

[02:03:45.760 --> 02:03:48.860]
On the first, on the day view of the Joe Rose Morning Show along with that other guy.

[02:03:48.980 --> 02:03:49.640]
What's his name? Kenny?

[02:03:50.140 --> 02:03:50.460]
Jason Jackson.

[02:03:52.540 --> 02:03:54.200]
Jason Jackson. No more Kenny and Bo.

[02:03:54.640 --> 02:03:54.820]
Oh!

[02:03:56.020 --> 02:03:58.880]
I'm not sure what I have to do to last hour on Joe Bell or Kenny and Bo.

[02:03:59.020 --> 02:04:00.140]
Well, he invented that show.

[02:04:01.200 --> 02:04:04.280]
He invented it and then he made sure they did everything in their power to make it feel.

[02:04:05.500 --> 02:04:07.280]
I mean, why do people do that?

[02:04:08.440 --> 02:04:11.600]
Why do they come up with some kind of an idea and say, oh, this is going to really be great.

[02:04:11.680 --> 02:04:13.580]
And then they throw every roadblock in a way.

[02:04:14.020 --> 02:04:15.680]
You know, because I mean Kenny at least is a job job.

[02:04:15.680 --> 02:04:16.160]
Just don't.

[02:04:16.340 --> 02:04:17.920]
Remember, they thought they were all good ideas.

[02:04:18.920 --> 02:04:19.120]
Yeah.

[02:04:19.620 --> 02:04:21.120]
Like like the square table?

[02:04:21.340 --> 02:04:23.240]
Sure, in the sports slide areas and all that.

[02:04:23.260 --> 02:04:24.200]
And then of course, who was gay?

[02:04:24.380 --> 02:04:24.800]
Who's gay?

[02:04:25.040 --> 02:04:25.180]
Right.

[02:04:25.360 --> 02:04:26.160]
Gay or not gay?

[02:04:26.340 --> 02:04:26.620]
Like that?

[02:04:27.620 --> 02:04:39.840]
And then of course, if that didn't push away the audience enough, then we put the last nail in their coffin with Alex Marvaz and Ethan Skolnik and Iro Wynnbag and a popery of sports writers who couldn't get arrested in a panty raid.

[02:04:40.780 --> 02:04:44.360]
Jesus, God Almighty, jolly joe, you are the anti-Christ.

[02:04:44.740 --> 02:04:46.780]
He is the anti-Christ of radio. I'll tell you that.

[02:04:47.360 --> 02:04:48.540]
Is there any doubt about it?

[02:04:49.740 --> 02:04:50.020]
None.

[02:04:50.460 --> 02:04:52.280]
Oh, you know, you and him get along pretty well.

[02:04:52.300 --> 02:04:52.940]
He loves your show.

[02:04:53.680 --> 02:04:54.000]
Oh, yeah.

[02:04:54.360 --> 02:04:56.200]
That's why he came up with that tape thing, you know.

[02:04:56.200 --> 02:05:04.020]
When we had that lunch and I kept telling him there is no way they're going to, I'm going to sit still and lie any tapes, best of tapes on his show.

[02:05:04.500 --> 02:05:09.840]
And he kept every five minutes, he kept coming, well I'm thinking that on Fridays, you know, he kept coming back to the tape.

[02:05:09.840 --> 02:05:12.200]
Sure. I think he ought to get together with Reverend Jones.

[02:05:12.340 --> 02:05:14.180]
I think they make a perfect match.

[02:05:14.960 --> 02:05:16.540]
In fact, maybe he is Reverend Jones.

[02:05:16.740 --> 02:05:17.120]
That could be.

[02:05:17.820 --> 02:05:19.780]
When surprised me, same mentality.

[02:05:20.480 --> 02:05:22.320]
924 on our world-framing pool, baby.

[02:05:23.780 --> 02:05:26.720]
That 1256, a lot of numbers see that guy. You're mailing it in.

[02:05:26.780 --> 02:05:28.940]
I wish we had depot of saying, he'll mailing it in.

[02:05:29.280 --> 02:05:30.280]
I'm sure we could arrange it.

[02:05:30.520 --> 02:05:33.480]
I might have kept his job if he'd said that a little bit more often or across the street.

[02:05:34.040 --> 02:05:35.120]
Even over there they hated him.

[02:05:35.260 --> 02:05:36.320]
Hey, this guy is for real.

[02:05:36.480 --> 02:05:39.840]
And when I'm up in Boca Tika, slapping all the women with painted lips around the pool.

[02:05:40.080 --> 02:05:41.780]
I listen to the little Rogers one to two hours.

[02:05:42.560 --> 02:05:45.800]
I mean, I listen to the little Rogers there and balance one to two hours.

[02:05:46.060 --> 02:05:47.580]
Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo.

[02:05:48.240 --> 02:05:48.840]
Hey, Coro.

[02:05:49.100 --> 02:05:49.260]
What?

[02:05:49.520 --> 02:05:51.660]
By the way, so I've been giving it some stories.

[02:05:51.660 --> 02:05:52.120]
I don't see.

[02:05:52.760 --> 02:05:54.160]
Oh, what he think it is.

[02:05:54.600 --> 02:05:58.360]
I know that me and you can do much better.

[02:05:58.680 --> 02:06:01.300]
Go in six to ten and on and five.

[02:06:01.760 --> 02:06:03.560]
A gentile and a cranky two.

[02:06:04.120 --> 02:06:07.560]
I think we might be happy to get there.

[02:06:09.440 --> 02:06:12.800]
I think you really got out of your mind.

[02:06:13.360 --> 02:06:15.120]
You got to have your weary bed.

[02:06:15.560 --> 02:06:16.620]
Strap on to tight.

[02:06:17.180 --> 02:06:19.220]
No chance I'll always show it to you.

[02:06:19.220 --> 02:06:22.560]
I'd rather die with the graphite together.

[02:06:24.880 --> 02:06:32.260]
Why I'll help you know that I'm a big, buggy Jew from Brooklyn Heights.

[02:06:33.300 --> 02:06:37.320]
I've been raped by everybody but you.

[02:06:37.800 --> 02:06:39.460]
You're not my child.

[02:06:40.520 --> 02:06:43.060]
Me and Mal, that would blow.

[02:06:43.520 --> 02:06:46.900]
No way that if we had a fight, that you'd survive.

[02:06:46.900 --> 02:06:50.800]
You'd want to hear a gentile and push it tight.

[02:06:51.320 --> 02:06:52.720]
That's graphing together.

[02:06:55.860 --> 02:07:00.000]
Strap on to tight.

[02:07:00.640 --> 02:07:02.500]
Strap on to tight.

[02:07:03.680 --> 02:07:04.440]
Strap on to tight.

[02:07:04.440 --> 02:07:04.900]
Strap on to tight.

[02:07:05.820 --> 02:07:05.900]
Strap on to tight.

[02:07:05.900 --> 02:07:07.300]
Strap on to tight.

[02:07:08.100 --> 02:07:08.920]
Strap on to tight.

[02:07:11.940 --> 02:07:13.520]
But you were Jew and me.

[02:07:13.520 --> 02:07:16.820]
For me, is much better since the 10.

[02:07:16.980 --> 02:07:18.760]
Not five, it's only right.

[02:07:19.200 --> 02:07:21.140]
That I should get more sleep at night.

[02:07:21.760 --> 02:07:24.980]
I think we might be happy to get there.

[02:07:25.220 --> 02:07:27.140]
Strap on to tight.

[02:07:27.400 --> 02:07:30.400]
Strap on to tight.

[02:07:30.400 --> 02:07:32.620]
What can you do that now?

[02:07:34.540 --> 02:07:37.680]
Strap on to tight.

[02:07:37.980 --> 02:07:41.100]
Strap on to tight.

[02:07:42.240 --> 02:07:43.040]
Strap on to tight.

[02:07:43.620 --> 02:07:46.800]
Strap on to tight.

[02:07:47.240 --> 02:07:48.660]
Strap on to tight.

[02:07:56.180 --> 02:07:59.980]
One or three, this would be all when the QM janitor is going to come in and do a few live spots.

[02:08:00.060 --> 02:08:00.940]
I can't wait to hear those.

[02:08:02.320 --> 02:08:03.220]
938 votes on the pool.

[02:08:03.340 --> 02:08:04.140]
I think we got it, Lyft.

[02:08:04.200 --> 02:08:05.580]
I don't think it's even going to be a contest.

[02:08:05.860 --> 02:08:08.020]
I could be wrong about that, Chris, but you never know.

[02:08:09.620 --> 02:08:11.580]
And you said, oh, no, are you crazy?

[02:08:11.860 --> 02:08:12.360]
Didn't you say that?

[02:08:12.600 --> 02:08:15.920]
Well, no, I said 950 and you said, I was crazy for shooting so high.

[02:08:16.440 --> 02:08:18.520]
No, I said you're crazy for underselling the old Queen.

[02:08:18.860 --> 02:08:19.280]
Yeah, okay.

[02:08:19.780 --> 02:08:21.140]
For selling me a little bit short.

[02:08:21.520 --> 02:08:25.920]
When the ethics committee voted to boot Bob Packwood from the Senate for Loot Sexual Harassment in 1995,

[02:08:26.760 --> 02:08:31.160]
Senator or former senator soon, Larry Craig lamented the difficult decision but called it the right one.

[02:08:32.060 --> 02:08:37.480]
After Packwood resigned the next day, Craig then a member of the Senate Ethics Committee shared a tearful embrace

[02:08:37.480 --> 02:08:38.880]
with this former colleague.

[02:08:39.840 --> 02:08:43.900]
One particularly poignant moment came during an exchange between Packwood and Larry Craig,

[02:08:44.080 --> 02:08:47.480]
member of the ethics panel Edwin Chen, reported in the LA Times September 895,

[02:08:48.520 --> 02:08:54.680]
after where they shook hands and hugged one another, then Craig began sobbing and quickly strode into the GOP cloakroom

[02:08:54.680 --> 02:08:56.100]
as hands covering his face.

[02:08:56.960 --> 02:08:58.120]
His hands over his pus.

[02:08:59.280 --> 02:09:03.520]
It was not an easy decision to vote to expel a colleague from the Senate but it was the right one Craig said

[02:09:03.520 --> 02:09:10.040]
of the Ethics Committee sanction related to charges that Packwood made 18 unwanted and unwelcome sexual advances against women.

[02:09:10.880 --> 02:09:16.180]
They shared an embrace and he broke into tears and went with his hands covering his pus.

[02:09:17.520 --> 02:09:17.920]
Larry Craig.

[02:09:18.860 --> 02:09:19.240]
Hey Larry.

[02:09:19.520 --> 02:09:19.980]
You fairy.

[02:09:20.220 --> 02:09:21.500]
Got a nice ring to it, don't you?

[02:09:21.740 --> 02:09:22.140]
Sure does.

[02:09:23.580 --> 02:09:25.580]
All the Republican classic queens all the time.

[02:09:26.040 --> 02:09:29.420]
945 votes are coming in and Chucks and you know who's getting the bulk of the new votes?

[02:09:30.360 --> 02:09:30.760]
Chucks.

[02:09:31.120 --> 02:09:35.700]
Chucks, fellow 42 from nowhere to 42 and Mark Eisenberg's only got two.

[02:09:36.780 --> 02:09:37.180]
Wow.

[02:09:39.660 --> 02:09:43.060]
5670560, Mark Eisenberg, it seems to me he never belonged on here in the first place.

[02:09:43.460 --> 02:09:44.300]
Where did he come from?

[02:09:44.440 --> 02:09:44.900]
What was he doing?

[02:09:45.540 --> 02:09:46.020]
He was here.

[02:09:46.580 --> 02:09:48.380]
I mean he was a flunky producer or something like that?

[02:09:48.560 --> 02:09:49.200]
Like Stu Gatz.

[02:09:49.640 --> 02:09:49.760]
Sure.

[02:09:49.840 --> 02:09:50.960]
Other guy that didn't belong on here.

[02:09:51.480 --> 02:09:53.400]
On either station and still doesn't.

[02:09:54.440 --> 02:09:55.060]
WNCYM, hello.

[02:09:55.640 --> 02:09:56.360]
Neil, how are you?

[02:09:56.520 --> 02:09:57.180]
I'm okay sir.

[02:10:21.300 --> 02:10:24.620]
I had an interesting experience last week in the

[02:10:27.120 --> 02:10:27.960]
last week.

[02:10:32.220 --> 02:10:33.600]
I don't know.

[02:10:33.600 --> 02:10:33.600]

[02:10:33.660 --> 02:10:33.660]

[02:10:33.740 --> 02:10:33.740]

[02:10:33.740 --> 02:10:33.740]

[02:10:33.740 --> 02:10:33.740]

[02:10:33.740 --> 02:10:33.740]

[02:10:33.740 --> 02:10:33.740]

[02:10:33.740 --> 02:10:33.740]

[02:10:33.740 --> 02:10:33.740]

[02:10:33.740 --> 02:10:33.740]

[02:10:33.740 --> 02:10:33.740]

[02:10:33.740 --> 02:10:33.740]

[02:10:33.740 --> 02:10:33.740]

[02:10:33.860 --> 02:10:33.940]
I don't know.

[02:10:33.940 --> 02:10:35.680]
I don't know.

[02:10:35.680 --> 02:10:35.680]

[02:10:35.680 --> 02:10:35.960]
I don't know.

[02:10:35.960 --> 02:10:36.460]
I don't know.

[02:10:36.560 --> 02:10:37.680]
I don't know.

[02:10:38.080 --> 02:10:39.400]
I don't know.

[02:10:39.480 --> 02:10:39.640]
I don't know.

[02:10:40.100 --> 02:10:40.460]
I don't know.

[02:10:41.460 --> 02:10:41.820]
I don't know.

[02:10:43.740 --> 02:10:45.580]
I don't know.

[02:10:46.160 --> 02:10:49.660]
I don't know.

[02:10:49.900 --> 02:10:52.260]
I don't know.

[02:10:52.260 --> 02:10:54.600]
I don't know.

[02:10:54.600 --> 02:10:56.060]
I actually have no idea.

[02:10:57.360 --> 02:10:58.860]
Maybe we can get a fire report on that.

[02:10:59.040 --> 02:11:00.960]
If I find out he had any of those sports writers on.

[02:11:01.200 --> 02:11:02.020]
I see Joe.

[02:11:02.700 --> 02:11:04.620]
Joe's got, he carries too much weight in the market.

[02:11:05.460 --> 02:11:06.220]
As opposed to Kenny.

[02:11:06.400 --> 02:11:09.140]
I mean Kenny was on Wild 100 but what's that got to do with sports, right?

[02:11:09.660 --> 02:11:13.460]
So, but with Joe, he's not going to let them do it with the show the way they did with Kenny and Bow.

[02:11:16.540 --> 02:11:17.140]
WDQYM, hello.

[02:11:17.640 --> 02:11:18.860]
Neil, oh my god.

[02:11:19.320 --> 02:11:19.720]
Yes sir.

[02:11:20.040 --> 02:11:24.580]
By the way, before I get to my important question, have you tried dog visor?

[02:11:26.440 --> 02:11:27.380]
Next question.

[02:11:27.520 --> 02:11:27.820]
Very good.

[02:11:27.980 --> 02:11:28.140]
Okay.

[02:11:29.120 --> 02:11:36.700]
With all of the nonsense with the Republican, let's not call them gay because here's the question.

[02:11:36.880 --> 02:11:39.000]
I've known a number of women who are bisexual.

[02:11:39.600 --> 02:11:40.180]
I'm straight.

[02:11:40.300 --> 02:11:43.040]
I've got a couple of cousins who are pretty flaming to be honest.

[02:11:43.740 --> 02:11:52.960]
Why is it that women who have sex with men and women are bisexual but guys like Ted Haggard, Larry Craig,

[02:11:53.780 --> 02:11:56.180]
the former government of the majority from New Jersey.

[02:11:56.660 --> 02:11:57.880]
Why are they considered gay?

[02:11:58.220 --> 02:12:00.220]
Is there obviously having sex with men and women?

[02:12:00.340 --> 02:12:01.640]
Who considers them gay?

[02:12:01.800 --> 02:12:02.180]
Who said that?

[02:12:02.180 --> 02:12:05.860]
Well, everybody, Larry Craig was on, he has to say he's not gay.

[02:12:05.980 --> 02:12:07.380]
Why can't they just say they're bisexual?

[02:12:08.300 --> 02:12:09.120]
Because they're liars.

[02:12:09.360 --> 02:12:10.140]
Because they're liars.

[02:12:10.680 --> 02:12:12.420]
Because they're liars sir.

[02:12:13.140 --> 02:12:13.340]
What?

[02:12:16.460 --> 02:12:17.260]
One more time.

[02:12:17.380 --> 02:12:17.820]
Give them one more.

[02:12:18.640 --> 02:12:20.380]
Because they're liars.

[02:12:25.500 --> 02:12:27.960]
56070560560 on the Verizon and Singular wireless line.

[02:12:28.040 --> 02:12:29.080]
Like I said, I like the calls.

[02:12:31.220 --> 02:12:32.500]
What are you laughing about?

[02:12:32.640 --> 02:12:33.160]
What are you talking about?

[02:12:33.640 --> 02:12:34.540]
I told myself a funny joke.

[02:12:35.420 --> 02:12:36.400]
952 votes in a full.

[02:12:36.460 --> 02:12:43.880]
We're going to go way over a thousand then they will fear us and then Joe Bell is going to sit scratching his fat ass and his chair in his office saying,

[02:12:43.880 --> 02:12:48.800]
Oh gee, I guess I haven't chased all the cars away or all the audience away yet.

[02:12:49.020 --> 02:12:51.100]
Right, that's right, jolly Joe, not all of them.

[02:12:51.240 --> 02:12:51.680]
Just most.

[02:12:52.800 --> 02:12:53.520]
Just most.

[02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:56.480]
You have done a demo, you know that thing, the demolition derby?

[02:12:57.020 --> 02:12:57.160]
Yes.

[02:12:57.600 --> 02:12:59.560]
He'd be the champion there, let me tell you right now.

[02:12:59.940 --> 02:13:00.940]
He has demolished.

[02:13:01.100 --> 02:13:05.960]
He has come in and done a crash and burn on this radio station like so which has never been seen.

[02:13:06.300 --> 02:13:07.480]
I've never seen anything like it.

[02:13:07.780 --> 02:13:08.760]
And he's still got the job.

[02:13:08.880 --> 02:13:11.700]
He's still sitting there with his fat ass and the chair somewhere in the building.

[02:13:12.560 --> 02:13:13.660]
Have you seen him today?

[02:13:13.860 --> 02:13:14.200]
Is he there?

[02:13:14.700 --> 02:13:15.040]
Joe Bell?

[02:13:15.280 --> 02:13:15.680]
Yes.

[02:13:15.840 --> 02:13:15.840]

[02:13:17.220 --> 02:13:19.160]
Joe freaking fat ass bell.

[02:13:19.160 --> 02:13:20.860]
No, I have not seen Joe freaking carol.

[02:13:20.960 --> 02:13:24.100]
He's only there because Joe Bell don't have the balls to fire him.

[02:13:24.380 --> 02:13:25.280]
No, you're wrong.

[02:13:25.560 --> 02:13:25.840]
He's not.

[02:13:26.120 --> 02:13:26.120]

[02:13:27.540 --> 02:13:28.500]
Let me say it again.

[02:13:28.520 --> 02:13:29.240]
He did a great job.

[02:13:29.320 --> 02:13:32.520]
He is scared, terrified because they.

[02:13:32.880 --> 02:13:33.600]
Joyce likes clearance.

[02:13:34.160 --> 02:13:34.480]
They all like.

[02:13:34.480 --> 02:13:34.780]
Joyce.

[02:13:35.080 --> 02:13:35.540]
They all like.

[02:13:35.540 --> 02:13:36.580]
Well, on the same page.

[02:13:36.900 --> 02:13:38.680]
They think it's a great thing they're doing.

[02:13:39.320 --> 02:13:39.720]
They all do.

[02:13:39.880 --> 02:13:40.160]
They all do.

[02:13:40.160 --> 02:13:42.180]
They sit on the twin holder together.

[02:13:43.180 --> 02:13:43.900]
Excuse me?

[02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:45.440]
W-Q-A-M, hello.

[02:13:45.640 --> 02:13:46.620]
Neil, you have to admit.

[02:13:46.800 --> 02:13:47.660]
Joyce has to get in.

[02:13:47.680 --> 02:13:49.220]
Yeah, you have to admit that you're an idiot.

[02:13:49.380 --> 02:13:50.380]
Q-A-M, not there.

[02:13:51.600 --> 02:13:52.600]
W-Q-A-M, hello.

[02:13:54.840 --> 02:13:55.580]
Q-A-M.

[02:13:57.340 --> 02:13:59.040]
Neil, I have two words.

[02:13:59.940 --> 02:14:00.300]
Customers.

[02:14:00.340 --> 02:14:01.040]
I have one word.

[02:14:01.220 --> 02:14:01.500]
Goodbye.

[02:14:02.820 --> 02:14:03.840]
Five-sale, that's hyphenated.

[02:14:04.020 --> 02:14:05.420]
5-6-705-60.

[02:14:05.860 --> 02:14:06.960]
Is it hyphenated or not?

[02:14:07.100 --> 02:14:07.580]
I don't think so.

[02:14:08.060 --> 02:14:08.360]
I don't know.

[02:14:08.680 --> 02:14:10.060]
It's only hyphenated when you say it.

[02:14:10.060 --> 02:14:11.060]
Like that.

[02:14:13.100 --> 02:14:14.340]
W-Q-A-M, hello.

[02:14:15.800 --> 02:14:16.240]
Neil.

[02:14:16.720 --> 02:14:16.960]
Yes.

[02:14:17.540 --> 02:14:18.280]
How are you today?

[02:14:18.760 --> 02:14:19.100]
OK.

[02:14:19.340 --> 02:14:19.820]
How are you today?

[02:14:20.320 --> 02:14:21.080]
I'm doing great.

[02:14:21.300 --> 02:14:22.180]
Thanks for asking.

[02:14:22.740 --> 02:14:25.380]
Just wanted to, you know, along the same topic.

[02:14:25.600 --> 02:14:28.360]
What do you think about all these Republicans, second-per-gates?

[02:14:28.500 --> 02:14:29.620]
Actually, you have Larry Craig.

[02:14:29.960 --> 02:14:31.800]
You have good old pastor, Teddy.

[02:14:32.020 --> 02:14:33.920]
You have that Bob Allen.

[02:14:34.060 --> 02:14:36.320]
What kind of a question is that?

[02:14:36.400 --> 02:14:37.100]
What do I think of it?

[02:14:37.140 --> 02:14:37.840]
What does that mean?

[02:14:38.640 --> 02:14:39.500]
What do you think?

[02:14:39.600 --> 02:14:40.040]
What do you think?

[02:14:40.040 --> 02:14:40.040]

[02:14:40.040 --> 02:14:40.540]
I don't think it is.

[02:14:40.640 --> 02:14:42.520]
But they just actually repressed her.

[02:14:42.840 --> 02:14:44.840]
They are self-hating is what it is.

[02:14:45.260 --> 02:14:49.760]
Self-hating like misfudge and anculture and all these other right-wing closet cases.

[02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:50.780]
That's what they are.

[02:14:51.620 --> 02:14:52.320]
Repressed my ass.

[02:14:52.520 --> 02:14:52.800]
I'm sorry.

[02:14:53.720 --> 02:14:54.280]
9-65.

[02:14:54.740 --> 02:14:55.240]
Look at that.

[02:14:55.480 --> 02:14:56.140]
Well, I'm telling you.

[02:14:56.880 --> 02:14:58.720]
And Joe Costello's got 50,000 votes.

[02:14:58.780 --> 02:14:59.360]
He's got 48.

[02:14:59.600 --> 02:15:02.860]
He went from zero to 48 faster than he can say off the air.

[02:15:04.180 --> 02:15:04.780]
How do you like that?

[02:15:04.960 --> 02:15:06.100]
They love Joe Costello.

[02:15:06.420 --> 02:15:06.940]
And D-fo.

[02:15:07.060 --> 02:15:08.600]
Maybe the Joe Costello and D-fo show.

[02:15:08.600 --> 02:15:09.760]
What do you say?

[02:15:11.240 --> 02:15:12.200]
The WQAM.

[02:15:12.320 --> 02:15:12.440]
Hello.

[02:15:13.300 --> 02:15:14.080]
Helen Neal.

[02:15:14.480 --> 02:15:14.680]
Yes.

[02:15:15.040 --> 02:15:18.120]
What the hell happened to the both show?

[02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:19.460]
History.

[02:15:19.840 --> 02:15:20.060]
Gone.

[02:15:21.240 --> 02:15:21.920]
No kidding.

[02:15:22.500 --> 02:15:23.580]
Let me say it again.

[02:15:23.860 --> 02:15:24.080]
Gone.

[02:15:25.060 --> 02:15:25.540]
Done.

[02:15:25.640 --> 02:15:25.800]
Wow.

[02:15:26.200 --> 02:15:27.300]
When's the mall coming back?

[02:15:28.020 --> 02:15:28.980]
Next Monday.

[02:15:29.900 --> 02:15:30.720]
Thank you.

[02:15:30.980 --> 02:15:31.540]
Have a good weekend.

[02:15:32.220 --> 02:15:33.660]
I think that was the bird back from the grave.

[02:15:34.140 --> 02:15:34.820]
Have a good weekend.

[02:15:34.960 --> 02:15:35.280]
You hear that?

[02:15:35.520 --> 02:15:35.680]
Sure.

[02:15:37.620 --> 02:15:39.180]
Well, you're running in the head.

[02:15:39.780 --> 02:15:41.080]
Yeah, that's always a good idea.

[02:15:41.200 --> 02:15:41.740]
A plan way ahead.

[02:15:42.540 --> 02:15:43.440]
Like the one in December.

[02:15:43.820 --> 02:15:45.440]
I got two weeks left vacation this year.

[02:15:45.540 --> 02:15:46.220]
I just figured it out.

[02:15:47.300 --> 02:15:49.000]
I think starting tomorrow is a good idea.

[02:15:49.220 --> 02:15:49.960]
I mean starting Monday.

[02:15:50.940 --> 02:15:51.520]
9-65.

[02:15:51.940 --> 02:15:52.700]
And that pulled one time.

[02:15:52.840 --> 02:15:53.800]
I bet your Chris is shocked.

[02:15:53.940 --> 02:15:54.580]
Aren't you amazed?

[02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:55.680]
I'm totally amazed.

[02:15:55.860 --> 02:15:56.400]
I'm totally surprised.

[02:15:56.580 --> 02:15:57.420]
You could care less.

[02:15:58.020 --> 02:15:58.120]
Huh?

[02:15:58.940 --> 02:16:00.220]
Which department of QA mayor?

[02:16:00.380 --> 02:16:01.240]
No, you're not fooling me.

[02:16:01.280 --> 02:16:02.040]
You just don't care.

[02:16:02.260 --> 02:16:03.280]
What are you talking about?

[02:16:03.520 --> 02:16:05.040]
I mean, you care about the show a little bit.

[02:16:05.040 --> 02:16:08.500]
But the poll, it's just, you know, it's just for your father.

[02:16:09.440 --> 02:16:09.880]
And my mother.

[02:16:09.880 --> 02:16:11.040]
With Steve Martin in personality,

[02:16:11.200 --> 02:16:13.440]
would you miss the most Scott Ferell 2-17?

[02:16:13.880 --> 02:16:16.020]
The Moorman has aged past D-fo.

[02:16:16.240 --> 02:16:16.600]
Uh-oh.

[02:16:18.260 --> 02:16:19.980]
Moorman 192 and D-fo 190.

[02:16:21.120 --> 02:16:22.220]
We need a few more votes.

[02:16:22.220 --> 02:16:23.640]
Let's mail them in for D-fo.

[02:16:24.640 --> 02:16:25.600]
None of the above 163.

[02:16:26.340 --> 02:16:27.060]
That's 164.

[02:16:27.200 --> 02:16:28.140]
That's moving as I speak.

[02:16:28.480 --> 02:16:29.600]
Gel, the only 76.

[02:16:30.040 --> 02:16:31.220]
Jokas, still 50-1.

[02:16:31.280 --> 02:16:32.340]
He's right on Gel, the ass.

[02:16:33.180 --> 02:16:33.980]
The Crow 47.

[02:16:34.120 --> 02:16:35.660]
Kenny Walker's up to 20 now.

[02:16:35.820 --> 02:16:35.980]
Wow.

[02:16:36.860 --> 02:16:37.800]
Ron Hershey, 10.

[02:16:37.940 --> 02:16:39.960]
And Mark Eisenberg still, Solomon, they dose.

[02:16:39.960 --> 02:16:43.200]
The screens, they're never happy.

[02:16:43.700 --> 02:16:44.960]
They're never just made.

[02:16:45.200 --> 02:16:46.920]
And stay home all the low.

[02:16:47.760 --> 02:16:49.900]
Thousand central charges against Rick.

[02:16:50.060 --> 02:16:51.780]
Or he's dog fighting.

[02:16:52.040 --> 02:16:54.260]
They're gambling on the dog fighting.

[02:16:54.460 --> 02:16:57.120]
And he's personally executing dogs.

[02:16:57.320 --> 02:16:58.780]
They don't measure up to his standards.

[02:16:58.780 --> 02:17:00.840]
And not putting them down because they're sicker and things.

[02:17:01.340 --> 02:17:04.460]
Killing them because they won't win.

[02:17:04.460 --> 02:17:09.400]
You killed dogs, dogs, and you denied it.

[02:17:09.600 --> 02:17:11.740]
Now you made your plea.

[02:17:12.040 --> 02:17:16.760]
Up to five years in the big house.

[02:17:17.160 --> 02:17:19.160]
It's what you could see.

[02:17:19.720 --> 02:17:22.900]
The drummer dogs, it was not mine.

[02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:26.640]
Electrocutions that win the night.

[02:17:27.440 --> 02:17:28.420]
Hey, you're guilty.

[02:17:29.480 --> 02:17:30.500]
Hey, you're guilty.

[02:17:31.080 --> 02:17:32.360]
Hey, you're guilty.

[02:17:33.360 --> 02:17:34.360]
You're guilty.

[02:17:35.180 --> 02:17:37.620]
Now you're not fistroo.

[02:17:38.460 --> 02:17:41.940]
Hey, you're guilty.

[02:17:43.200 --> 02:17:45.520]
Now you're not fistroo.

[02:17:45.940 --> 02:17:49.380]
Hey, you're not fistroo.

[02:17:49.420 --> 02:17:52.960]
And it felt since your off-roo.

[02:17:53.340 --> 02:17:56.700]
He just come in to kill you.

[02:17:57.760 --> 02:18:01.040]
And it's seven-two.

[02:18:01.700 --> 02:18:04.200]
And you're not fistroo.

[02:18:06.320 --> 02:18:08.420]
117 at 560 W.A.M.

[02:18:08.520 --> 02:18:10.220]
We got a hundred and fifteen votes.

[02:18:10.380 --> 02:18:12.960]
I'd rather come in a big fat chunk.

[02:18:13.320 --> 02:18:16.080]
Real big fat chunks.

[02:18:16.560 --> 02:18:18.340]
And Joe Costello's got seventy-three.

[02:18:18.460 --> 02:18:19.740]
He's right on Geldy's butt.

[02:18:20.620 --> 02:18:22.640]
Geldy's seventy-six and Joe's got seventy-three.

[02:18:22.760 --> 02:18:24.080]
I don't like the way Joe's moving up the ladder.

[02:18:24.080 --> 02:18:27.160]
And Joe, I bet you Joe didn't vote more than fifty-six times.

[02:18:27.580 --> 02:18:27.960]
I'm sure.

[02:18:28.780 --> 02:18:32.540]
I love this story that you disfaxed in that whoever sent the sin thank you so much.

[02:18:33.100 --> 02:18:34.220]
North King's Town Road Island.

[02:18:35.280 --> 02:18:39.040]
A man's been charged with extorting more than twenty thousand dollars from his elderly mother

[02:18:39.040 --> 02:18:44.180]
by repeatedly threatening the kidnap her beloved cat in demanding ransom, police say.

[02:18:46.480 --> 02:18:50.040]
Gary Lamar, forty-seven, was arrested Friday, released on two hundred dollars bail.

[02:18:50.040 --> 02:18:53.500]
He was been ordered to stay away from his seventy-eight-year-old mother, Mary Lamar Grancher.

[02:18:53.940 --> 02:19:00.580]
He started threatening the kidnap the cat just over a year ago after his mother kicked him out of her home, accusing him of abuse.

[02:19:01.600 --> 02:19:06.820]
This isn't just a family cat police, since you actually call this cat her companion since she lived alone.

[02:19:08.120 --> 02:19:13.460]
During the past year Lamar allegedly kidnapped the cat once and made kidnapping threats on an almost weekly basis.

[02:19:13.880 --> 02:19:16.640]
Police don't believe the cat was her but are continuing to investigate.

[02:19:17.760 --> 02:19:26.400]
Grancher made at least two dozen payments totally more than twenty thousand dollars in cash and checks to her son.

[02:19:26.720 --> 02:19:29.900]
Authorities are still sorting through her financial records in Germany exact them out.

[02:19:30.600 --> 02:19:34.200]
A phone listing for Lamar couldn't be located. She probably can't afford a phone at this point.

[02:19:34.540 --> 02:19:36.600]
Court officials said it's unclear whether he had an attorney.

[02:19:38.040 --> 02:19:38.920]
How do you like that?

[02:19:39.620 --> 02:19:40.200]
I think it's great.

[02:19:40.260 --> 02:19:43.660]
Twenty grand for threatening the kidnap her buddy cat.

[02:19:46.100 --> 02:19:47.220]
She must really love that.

[02:19:47.540 --> 02:19:48.000]
Put it here.

[02:19:50.480 --> 02:19:53.240]
So what do you think of that thousand and fifteen votes on the poll, huh?

[02:19:53.360 --> 02:19:54.300]
Does that show you a little something?

[02:19:54.900 --> 02:19:55.760]
It means we have an audience.

[02:19:56.300 --> 02:19:57.100]
No, it does not.

[02:19:58.240 --> 02:19:59.140]
You got to think positive.

[02:19:59.380 --> 02:20:03.400]
You know what that site that's like, Georgia, now we're talking before the show back in the day when I did that with the guest.

[02:20:03.640 --> 02:20:06.760]
You know, and I would do buyer with him or I'd have some psych on here.

[02:20:07.060 --> 02:20:08.580]
And the phones ring off the whole show.

[02:20:08.720 --> 02:20:13.640]
Well, you know, there's just a very small group of people listening and those people are all calling because they want their own private room.

[02:20:13.640 --> 02:20:18.660]
And then once they get their own reading, they're on fire with them, they're gone.

[02:20:18.860 --> 02:20:23.060]
They don't want to care about anybody else who wants to hear somebody else's bio rhythms.

[02:20:23.380 --> 02:20:24.440]
And I'm guilty.

[02:20:24.620 --> 02:20:26.400]
You know, I used to have an associate with the socks.

[02:20:26.900 --> 02:20:28.540]
We used to do those horrible shows.

[02:20:28.700 --> 02:20:31.120]
I did a lot of horrible shows like this one today, for example.

[02:20:32.240 --> 02:20:36.740]
Five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the Verizon singular wireless line.

[02:20:37.540 --> 02:20:38.380]
WQA M hello.

[02:20:38.920 --> 02:20:40.740]
Wow, Georgia is really brought to you.

[02:20:41.900 --> 02:20:42.680]
WQA M hello.

[02:20:43.960 --> 02:20:44.620]
Hey, Neil.

[02:20:45.100 --> 02:20:45.420]
Yes, sir.

[02:20:46.240 --> 02:20:48.180]
And respond to that rush on a key scone.

[02:20:48.440 --> 02:20:48.440]

[02:20:48.920 --> 02:20:49.640]
Tom to get cereal.

[02:20:50.160 --> 02:20:50.420]
Who?

[02:20:50.960 --> 02:20:51.160]
Oh, yeah.

[02:20:51.160 --> 02:20:52.180]
Tom to get something.

[02:20:52.880 --> 02:20:56.720]
It sounds like a really fantastic concept for a restaurant, doesn't it?

[02:20:56.920 --> 02:20:58.400]
A restaurant that only serves cereal?

[02:20:59.000 --> 02:20:59.540]
And you imagine?

[02:21:00.080 --> 02:21:00.420]
Yeah.

[02:21:00.820 --> 02:21:01.540]
Oh, I sure can.

[02:21:01.900 --> 02:21:02.160]
Yeah.

[02:21:02.420 --> 02:21:04.260]
What a concept to cereal connection.

[02:21:04.720 --> 02:21:05.860]
How about the toilet connection?

[02:21:07.360 --> 02:21:08.320]
God almighty.

[02:21:08.640 --> 02:21:09.660]
Whoever heard of such a thing.

[02:21:10.300 --> 02:21:11.300]
Now is he cereal?

[02:21:11.500 --> 02:21:12.800]
I mean, is it really such a place or not?

[02:21:12.860 --> 02:21:18.520]
Yeah, there's a one in like down in South like coral gables or the grove.

[02:21:18.660 --> 02:21:20.340]
I mean, is it a place that serves soup?

[02:21:20.700 --> 02:21:22.000]
What is that called?

[02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:23.000]

[02:21:23.300 --> 02:21:23.780]
What's soup man?

[02:21:24.440 --> 02:21:25.300]
The soup man, right?

[02:21:25.600 --> 02:21:25.960]
The original.

[02:21:26.420 --> 02:21:29.340]
But I'm sure they serve other things too like salads and stuff.

[02:21:29.580 --> 02:21:29.940]
They do, right?

[02:21:30.020 --> 02:21:30.440]
Yeah, of course.

[02:21:31.240 --> 02:21:33.400]
But a restaurant that serves only cereal?

[02:21:37.180 --> 02:21:38.360]
He can't be cereal.

[02:21:41.260 --> 02:21:44.360]
So, the WQAM would just come down.

[02:21:44.480 --> 02:21:45.920]
QI would call it as too funny.

[02:21:46.160 --> 02:21:46.700]
Hey Neil.

[02:21:47.620 --> 02:21:48.040]
Yep.

[02:21:48.460 --> 02:21:54.800]
Could you play any type of a cut with the late Dan...

[02:21:54.800 --> 02:21:55.120]
Ingram?

[02:21:55.880 --> 02:21:57.480]
No, the old hockey announcer.

[02:21:57.480 --> 02:21:58.120]
Dan, you know what?

[02:21:58.600 --> 02:21:59.960]
No, no hockey announcer, right?

[02:22:00.100 --> 02:22:00.320]
Dan.

[02:22:00.760 --> 02:22:02.360]
Get out of here, hockey announcer.

[02:22:02.360 --> 02:22:04.020]
Are you a crazy person or what?

[02:22:04.680 --> 02:22:06.320]
I'm gonna start playing hockey clips.

[02:22:06.480 --> 02:22:09.200]
Oh my god, I think Rimmer probably put them up to that.

[02:22:10.160 --> 02:22:13.500]
And the fact that you allowed me to do those shows without actually coming in there

[02:22:13.500 --> 02:22:15.560]
and physically bodily grabbing me?

[02:22:15.700 --> 02:22:17.340]
Doryk season on DVDs.

[02:22:17.580 --> 02:22:20.700]
Wow, I can't believe you get away with that.

[02:22:22.660 --> 02:22:24.160]
Hockey on this market?

[02:22:27.680 --> 02:22:32.760]
Oh, there's Leafs TV.

[02:22:33.060 --> 02:22:34.020]
Where's Panthers TV?

[02:22:34.220 --> 02:22:35.360]
Start one's not gonna be starting up.

[02:22:37.060 --> 02:22:41.540]
It's just another part of the puzzle, another piece of the puzzle that is South Florida.

[02:22:42.500 --> 02:22:47.840]
A hockey team in a market where they wouldn't know a hockey puck from their ass, from your shoe.

[02:22:51.080 --> 02:22:51.860]
WQAM, hello.

[02:22:51.860 --> 02:22:52.700]
Nail.

[02:22:52.940 --> 02:22:53.400]
Yes.

[02:22:55.480 --> 02:22:58.220]
I think his buddy put it in the quarter-route as that, finally.

[02:22:58.500 --> 02:22:59.700]
Pull them real tight, okay, sweetie?

[02:23:00.480 --> 02:23:02.260]
If you need any help, I'll be right down.

[02:23:03.380 --> 02:23:04.120]
WQAM, hello.

[02:23:04.720 --> 02:23:05.000]
Nail.

[02:23:05.480 --> 02:23:05.660]
Yes.

[02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:09.140]
Yeah, the ring shows my back and I compared the entrance to the model.

[02:23:09.780 --> 02:23:10.060]
Yeah.

[02:23:11.960 --> 02:23:12.760]
WQAM, hello.

[02:23:13.520 --> 02:23:14.040]
Yeah, Nail.

[02:23:14.480 --> 02:23:14.640]
Yes.

[02:23:15.200 --> 02:23:17.600]
Yeah, the big dog thinks you're a jerk ball.

[02:23:18.200 --> 02:23:18.520]
Yeah.

[02:23:19.580 --> 02:23:20.020]
Yeah.

[02:23:20.020 --> 02:23:24.460]
And do you think the Red Box still in the world fairies this year?

[02:23:28.800 --> 02:23:29.520]
WQAM, hello.

[02:23:30.080 --> 02:23:30.400]
Nail.

[02:23:30.920 --> 02:23:31.260]
Yes, sir.

[02:23:32.360 --> 02:23:34.640]
No sportswriters on Joe Rose this morning, thank God.

[02:23:34.640 --> 02:23:35.180]
All right.

[02:23:35.780 --> 02:23:36.180]
Excellent.

[02:23:36.680 --> 02:23:42.960]
But every coach under the sun called them, the University of Miami coach, the Panthers coach,

[02:23:43.160 --> 02:23:45.100]
Pat Riley, all, you know, Kiss and his butt.

[02:23:45.540 --> 02:23:45.720]
Yeah.

[02:23:46.180 --> 02:23:47.780]
But, uh, and Jason Jackson.

[02:23:48.460 --> 02:23:51.680]
No, the coaches also do live spots when they called in?

[02:23:52.120 --> 02:23:53.560]
No, no live spots in the coaches.

[02:23:54.740 --> 02:23:56.360]
I guess that's next week.

[02:23:56.600 --> 02:23:58.140]
Give the sales staff some time to sell them.

[02:23:58.360 --> 02:24:01.300]
But Joe Rose and Jason Jackson did about 20 live spots this morning.

[02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:02.240]
Good.

[02:24:02.420 --> 02:24:03.300]
We need the money, baby.

[02:24:03.420 --> 02:24:04.480]
Let me tell you right now, Jason.

[02:24:04.760 --> 02:24:05.320]
Just, huh?

[02:24:05.740 --> 02:24:05.980]
22.

[02:24:06.780 --> 02:24:09.060]
22 live spots between the two of this morning.

[02:24:09.140 --> 02:24:09.580]
How do you like that?

[02:24:09.760 --> 02:24:12.600]
And that's on the very first day when nobody even know they were going to be here.

[02:24:13.480 --> 02:24:16.620]
I would be surprised if they were peddling in all day yesterday, you know.

[02:24:17.480 --> 02:24:18.700]
We're going to be on Q&M tomorrow.

[02:24:18.820 --> 02:24:21.060]
We just found out now that it's contractually illegal.

[02:24:21.420 --> 02:24:23.620]
And we're going to be doing spots up the S.

[02:24:25.920 --> 02:24:27.320]
All spots radio.

[02:24:27.560 --> 02:24:29.400]
And you know something, what differences it make, okay?

[02:24:29.720 --> 02:24:31.960]
There's nothing entertaining about talking about ball games anyway.

[02:24:32.220 --> 02:24:33.540]
So why not do a bunch of spots?

[02:24:34.380 --> 02:24:35.340]
Am I right, George?

[02:24:35.720 --> 02:24:36.260]
Why not?

[02:24:36.460 --> 02:24:36.940]
Do one now?

[02:24:37.360 --> 02:24:41.120]
What would you listen to first, a bunch of spots like for a restaurant that sells only cereal?

[02:24:41.120 --> 02:24:43.540]
Or somebody talking about a ball game?

[02:24:43.680 --> 02:24:47.940]
I'd rather hear the same spot over and over again about the same bogus cereal restaurant than that.

[02:24:48.520 --> 02:24:49.580]
Well, give the guy a chance.

[02:24:49.740 --> 02:24:50.920]
In fact, maybe there's your show tomorrow.

[02:24:52.480 --> 02:24:53.040]
Neil.

[02:24:54.140 --> 02:24:54.340]
Guy.

[02:24:55.920 --> 02:24:56.900]
They're funky.

[02:24:57.560 --> 02:24:58.460]
They're old.

[02:24:59.220 --> 02:25:01.060]
They're the California proof.

[02:25:02.120 --> 02:25:04.820]
So when you're getting old and crazy.

[02:25:05.660 --> 02:25:09.100]
And your cons to pay you every day.

[02:25:09.100 --> 02:25:11.480]
Give us a wee bit.

[02:25:11.920 --> 02:25:13.100]
And that's for sure.

[02:25:13.760 --> 02:25:17.100]
And so for you, we got the cure.

[02:25:18.040 --> 02:25:19.620]
Just eat some of us.

[02:25:19.820 --> 02:25:21.300]
Eat us every day.

[02:25:22.560 --> 02:25:25.340]
And then flush your face away.

[02:25:25.840 --> 02:25:29.060]
Don't you want a clear ring called an replaced thing?

[02:25:30.340 --> 02:25:33.140]
No, I'm useless for replaced things.

[02:25:33.140 --> 02:25:36.040]
Yeah, it slacks his nice buddy.

[02:25:36.240 --> 02:25:38.020]
Don't wake fast.

[02:25:38.120 --> 02:25:39.620]
Just eat some food.

[02:25:40.300 --> 02:25:41.260]
Yeah, we'll play.

[02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:43.880]
I'm a party, yeah.

[02:25:44.100 --> 02:25:48.420]
I'm a party if you feed us your responsibility, man.

[02:25:49.380 --> 02:25:51.660]
I'm a party, I'm a party, man.

[02:25:51.860 --> 02:25:52.880]
California proof.

[02:25:53.480 --> 02:25:54.720]
What a way to go.

[02:25:54.880 --> 02:25:58.800]
135, 60 WQM, half an hour mad dog will be on from the touchdown club.

[02:25:58.840 --> 02:26:00.800]
It's touchdown club Tuesday, whatever that means.

[02:26:00.800 --> 02:26:01.980]
That's what it says on the schedule.

[02:26:02.020 --> 02:26:04.460]
But the schedule also says that Thursday, Georgia's on.

[02:26:04.640 --> 02:26:07.240]
So all you detract hanging on to that.

[02:26:07.240 --> 02:26:07.480]
Hang it on to that.

[02:26:07.760 --> 02:26:08.020]
Why?

[02:26:08.440 --> 02:26:09.200]
You're hanging on to that.

[02:26:09.340 --> 02:26:13.400]
We have 159 votes because we're getting freaked.

[02:26:14.380 --> 02:26:16.580]
Your boyfriend, Joe Castell, is going to 101.

[02:26:16.780 --> 02:26:22.960]
From 0 to 101, which means he's sitting there tapping and tapping and tapping and rebooting and tapping.

[02:26:23.240 --> 02:26:23.980]
Or somebody is.

[02:26:24.560 --> 02:26:27.800]
Listen, if you want to get votes, just put them on the pole every day.

[02:26:28.580 --> 02:26:29.500]
That's a good idea.

[02:26:29.860 --> 02:26:34.420]
If the poll question is, you know, what's your ultimate luxury car that you'd like to want?

[02:26:34.660 --> 02:26:38.440]
And you can put Corvette or Mercedes or Lamborghini or Joe Castell.

[02:26:39.500 --> 02:26:40.920]
And that's a great idea.

[02:26:42.420 --> 02:26:43.180]
Good take, George.

[02:26:43.560 --> 02:26:44.340]
You do it on your poll.

[02:26:45.640 --> 02:26:46.220]
It was yesterday.

[02:26:46.360 --> 02:26:47.980]
You didn't even do one yesterday.

[02:26:48.360 --> 02:26:52.120]
Yesterday didn't exist as compared to what?

[02:26:52.240 --> 02:26:52.920]
Is compared to today?

[02:26:53.400 --> 02:26:53.680]
That's right.

[02:26:53.760 --> 02:26:54.720]
This is a real show today.

[02:26:54.880 --> 02:26:57.580]
Yesterday was holiday-filling, filler material.

[02:26:57.580 --> 02:26:58.900]
Sure could fool the hell out of me.

[02:26:59.040 --> 02:27:00.940]
It was just we were part of the Marlins pre-game show.

[02:27:01.040 --> 02:27:01.680]
That's all we were.

[02:27:03.260 --> 02:27:04.540]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[02:27:04.660 --> 02:27:07.300]
Who did all of them open with this season, by the way, Chris?

[02:27:07.620 --> 02:27:08.360]
Washington Redskins.

[02:27:08.820 --> 02:27:10.340]
Washington Redskins, a girls team.

[02:27:10.540 --> 02:27:12.260]
That's really your last portion, I guess.

[02:27:13.280 --> 02:27:15.100]
And then I see their hurricanes play Oklahoma.

[02:27:15.140 --> 02:27:19.680]
Real team this week, as opposed to what was it, Marshall High School for Marshall Michigan last week?

[02:27:20.160 --> 02:27:21.060]
No, it was just Marshall.

[02:27:21.300 --> 02:27:23.080]
Marshall High School for Marshall Michigan.

[02:27:23.240 --> 02:27:26.080]
Marshall Redskins, I used to broadcast their basketball and football games.

[02:27:26.080 --> 02:27:27.280]
100 years ago.

[02:27:28.460 --> 02:27:32.440]
In Marshall Michigan, home of Winchewelers restaurant, he's been dead for a long time too, I'm sure.

[02:27:32.960 --> 02:27:33.880]
WNQ-YM, hello.

[02:27:34.380 --> 02:27:35.140]
Yeah, hi, Neil.

[02:27:35.360 --> 02:27:38.220]
Can we trade Latin to Borax for Sydney Codby?

[02:27:38.580 --> 02:27:39.780]
How about for Stubgats?

[02:27:42.140 --> 02:27:43.060]
WNQ-YM, hello.

[02:27:43.700 --> 02:27:43.900]
Neil.

[02:27:44.420 --> 02:27:44.580]
Yes.

[02:27:44.840 --> 02:27:45.140]
How you doing?

[02:27:45.680 --> 02:27:45.980]
Okay.

[02:27:46.480 --> 02:27:47.820]
You were talking about Jocs before.

[02:27:47.920 --> 02:27:49.340]
I want to ask you a question, your opinion.

[02:27:49.560 --> 02:27:53.780]
Besides Mad Dog, do you find any Jocs that are in broadcasting devison to humor?

[02:27:55.740 --> 02:27:57.740]
Do you think Joe Rose has a sense of humor?

[02:27:58.360 --> 02:27:58.460]
Two?

[02:27:59.340 --> 02:27:59.880]
That's it.

[02:28:00.680 --> 02:28:03.340]
I mean, would you ever find Damirino making fun of himself?

[02:28:03.540 --> 02:28:06.500]
Because I can understand how people, you know, put these people on the air.

[02:28:06.500 --> 02:28:07.760]
Listen to me.

[02:28:08.220 --> 02:28:10.300]
There are two X-Jocs in this market.

[02:28:10.400 --> 02:28:12.380]
I've said it before and I'll say it again for the last time.

[02:28:12.840 --> 02:28:14.960]
Mandage and Joe Rose, and then we're lucky we have them both.

[02:28:15.300 --> 02:28:18.240]
There's the only two X-Jocs in this market who belong to our really broadcasters.

[02:28:18.460 --> 02:28:21.320]
And now they're at the QAM, so what happens to the other station now?

[02:28:22.480 --> 02:28:23.880]
What do you mean what happens?

[02:28:24.160 --> 02:28:27.800]
I mean, who do they have there now, basically besides Gellby?

[02:28:28.940 --> 02:28:29.380]
Vuexter.

[02:28:30.760 --> 02:28:33.260]
Van LaBan, Van LaBaster, Siddiid.

[02:28:35.080 --> 02:28:35.340]
Okay.

[02:28:35.460 --> 02:28:37.400]
Jorge Siddano, in a supermarket chain.

[02:28:37.520 --> 02:28:39.260]
What about the two Amigos? Have you heard them?

[02:28:39.640 --> 02:28:39.860]
No.

[02:28:40.380 --> 02:28:41.140]
Oh my god.

[02:28:42.080 --> 02:28:42.940]
Consider yourself lucky.

[02:28:43.560 --> 02:28:43.720]
Good.

[02:28:44.060 --> 02:28:44.200]
Okay.

[02:28:44.500 --> 02:28:44.800]
Have a good day.

[02:28:45.080 --> 02:28:50.580]
See, this guy's confusing broadcasters and sports people, and this is the Jocs, I see it.

[02:28:50.580 --> 02:28:52.320]
He keeps screaming and yelling about.

[02:28:53.500 --> 02:28:56.860]
And people like the beesleaves are partly responsible for it, and then of course Joe will

[02:28:56.860 --> 02:28:57.540]
across the street.

[02:28:59.760 --> 02:29:00.460]
Same crap.

[02:29:00.800 --> 02:29:02.440]
Oh, we're going to put on a better sports station.

[02:29:02.700 --> 02:29:04.700]
Let's have a hundred sports stations, okay?

[02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:12.020]
Let's have a hundred idiots on there who used to wear a Jocs strap every weekend talking to crap about the same game.

[02:29:12.140 --> 02:29:13.180]
Sounds really exciting to me.

[02:29:14.280 --> 02:29:17.900]
I bet you we go over 1100 votes on here the way that Joe and his people are freeing.

[02:29:17.900 --> 02:29:21.860]
Either that or else he was just wildly popular and we never caught on to it, you know what?

[02:29:22.760 --> 02:29:24.160]
Because he's got a hundred and some votes.

[02:29:24.300 --> 02:29:27.960]
He passed, Geldy, like Geldy was passed out on the floor.

[02:29:29.800 --> 02:29:32.140]
Geldy has 80 and Jocs, 117.

[02:29:33.640 --> 02:29:36.220]
And meanwhile Moe is edging away from D-Fo too.

[02:29:36.340 --> 02:29:38.200]
It's a pretty good three-way battle. You Moe?

[02:29:39.180 --> 02:29:39.540]
No.

[02:29:40.140 --> 02:29:40.340]
Yay.

[02:29:41.340 --> 02:29:42.060]
WQA-M, hello.

[02:29:42.760 --> 02:29:43.520]
Hey, man, what's up, buddy?

[02:29:43.920 --> 02:29:44.280]
Yes, sir.

[02:29:44.840 --> 02:29:45.300]
How you doing?

[02:29:45.680 --> 02:29:46.040]
Okay.

[02:29:46.560 --> 02:29:48.860]
Hey, I heard George was asking about me earlier.

[02:29:49.180 --> 02:29:51.200]
I got a listen to Lucy Lopez here.

[02:29:51.240 --> 02:29:52.640]
I just got a call and say, hey, did they?

[02:29:53.180 --> 02:29:54.700]
You're the Lucy Lopez guy?

[02:29:55.160 --> 02:29:56.080]
Yeah, I told you about George.

[02:29:56.200 --> 02:29:58.220]
She made friends George, you know, all that stuff.

[02:29:58.580 --> 02:29:59.760]
Oh, get out of here.

[02:29:59.900 --> 02:30:00.480]
I'll go away.

[02:30:00.700 --> 02:30:02.120]
Go away already.

[02:30:05.560 --> 02:30:08.820]
Why is it that these, well, I'm going to answer the difficult question.

[02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:09.640]
It's a stupid question.

[02:30:09.840 --> 02:30:11.240]
Why do they think that I want to hear from them?

[02:30:11.580 --> 02:30:12.040]
They don't.

[02:30:12.080 --> 02:30:14.620]
They know that I don't and they know that you don't and that's what they call.

[02:30:14.620 --> 02:30:15.120]
Right.

[02:30:15.500 --> 02:30:17.960]
Because it's a surround, they have the one note they call.

[02:30:18.240 --> 02:30:18.620]
Let's all be aggravating.

[02:30:19.300 --> 02:30:22.080]
It's like not the quarter slot guy that's on his way to Vegas.

[02:30:22.480 --> 02:30:28.840]
I hope that a while the dragon comes out of the desert and drags your ass out there and eats you.

[02:30:29.440 --> 02:30:31.060]
I'm probably going to get bad into gesture.

[02:30:32.320 --> 02:30:33.260]
Quarter slot sky.

[02:30:33.380 --> 02:30:34.480]
We know where your slots are.

[02:30:34.580 --> 02:30:34.680]
Correct.

[02:30:34.820 --> 02:30:36.640]
Every time he stands up, the change falls out.

[02:30:37.400 --> 02:30:38.080]
Like, make green.

[02:30:40.200 --> 02:30:41.340]
WQA-M, hello.

[02:30:42.360 --> 02:30:43.500]
I can talk to Neil.

[02:30:44.340 --> 02:30:45.900]
With a voice like that.

[02:30:47.540 --> 02:30:48.600]
What's wrong with my voice?

[02:30:50.400 --> 02:30:51.400]
Well, we'll give it a shot.

[02:30:51.520 --> 02:30:51.880]
What do you got?

[02:30:53.360 --> 02:30:54.300]
I just want to talk to Neil.

[02:30:54.740 --> 02:30:55.540]
You're talking to Neil.

[02:30:57.560 --> 02:30:58.280]
You're Neil?

[02:30:59.620 --> 02:31:00.640]
You, my brother.

[02:31:01.080 --> 02:31:01.220]
Get out.

[02:31:01.440 --> 02:31:04.880]
Here at around the clock, beat the broadcasters his back for 2007.

[02:31:05.100 --> 02:31:09.040]
On sports radio 560 WQA-M, this football season, play against W.

[02:31:09.200 --> 02:31:10.480]
Hey, let's get real quick.

[02:31:10.500 --> 02:31:12.800]
I'm bringing up a story from today's Harold.

[02:31:12.800 --> 02:31:15.740]
I don't know if you got to see it online or get a copy of the paper.

[02:31:16.280 --> 02:31:20.860]
But that knucklehead who pays $45 a gallon for un-pasturized milk.

[02:31:22.080 --> 02:31:22.800]
Didn't see it.

[02:31:23.380 --> 02:31:23.700]
Oh, dude.

[02:31:23.940 --> 02:31:24.320]
Wait, wait, wait.

[02:31:24.540 --> 02:31:25.400]
Take a look at the article.

[02:31:25.580 --> 02:31:32.480]
We take a look more so at the picture of the guy who has a grin on his face while he drinks his gallon of $45 gallon.

[02:31:33.400 --> 02:31:34.600]
$25 down the mill.

[02:31:34.960 --> 02:31:35.200]
Great.

[02:31:35.280 --> 02:31:36.200]
I hope he jokes on it.

[02:31:36.280 --> 02:31:38.680]
Now, I hope he winds up eating at the cereal factory.

[02:31:39.040 --> 02:31:42.780]
He just might as well just go out and put his not done in utter while he's doing it.

[02:31:42.780 --> 02:31:43.420]
He's down the field.

[02:31:43.480 --> 02:31:44.180]
There you go.

[02:31:44.300 --> 02:31:44.540]
OK.

[02:31:44.900 --> 02:31:45.600]
All right, any other one?

[02:31:46.700 --> 02:31:47.420]
$567.0560.

[02:31:47.500 --> 02:31:48.760]
What does the guy say is the cereal killer?

[02:31:49.620 --> 02:31:49.740]
Yeah.

[02:31:50.600 --> 02:31:51.120]
Uh-oh.

[02:31:51.980 --> 02:31:52.900]
1073 on that pool.

[02:31:53.020 --> 02:31:54.300]
We're approaching 1,100, man.

[02:31:55.100 --> 02:31:57.340]
Then, the court, it does mean anything.

[02:31:57.400 --> 02:31:59.240]
Is there all three boats now for Joe Castello?

[02:31:59.620 --> 02:32:00.660]
He's, he's creeping our fold.

[02:32:01.480 --> 02:32:02.580]
He's got 100 and said nice.

[02:32:02.660 --> 02:32:03.340]
We got 107.

[02:32:05.700 --> 02:32:09.940]
Maybe because we had so many great calls today, maybe all of a sudden we're getting this tremendous outpouring from the audience.

[02:32:10.140 --> 02:32:11.060]
You think that could be it?

[02:32:11.060 --> 02:32:11.180]
No.

[02:32:11.180 --> 02:32:11.580]
Huh?

[02:32:12.340 --> 02:32:12.720]
No.

[02:32:12.860 --> 02:32:13.760]
That might be it.

[02:32:13.900 --> 02:32:14.980]
It's like the old days, baby.

[02:32:16.920 --> 02:32:17.600]
WQAM, hello.

[02:32:18.180 --> 02:32:19.220]
Hey, how are you doing?

[02:32:19.480 --> 02:32:19.940]
OK, sir.

[02:32:20.400 --> 02:32:21.960]
What do you think about that Jerry Lewis?

[02:32:22.260 --> 02:32:23.620]
He looks pretty good for his age, huh?

[02:32:24.140 --> 02:32:24.760]
Didn't see him.

[02:32:25.240 --> 02:32:26.020]
Didn't see one second.

[02:32:26.220 --> 02:32:26.360]
He's good.

[02:32:27.120 --> 02:32:28.680]
Yeah, for 150, he looks great.

[02:32:29.600 --> 02:32:30.340]
Yeah, he looks good.

[02:32:30.420 --> 02:32:31.340]
He makes some good money, too.

[02:32:31.780 --> 02:32:31.980]
Yeah.

[02:32:32.180 --> 02:32:32.440]
And?

[02:32:32.900 --> 02:32:33.400]
He looks good.

[02:32:33.940 --> 02:32:35.260]
Do you think I'll ask you one quick?

[02:32:35.380 --> 02:32:36.220]
Let me ask you one question.

[02:32:36.540 --> 02:32:36.680]
Sure.

[02:32:37.040 --> 02:32:37.940]
Do you think he looks good?

We're going over 1100 today and all thanks to Joe Castell.

[02:33:14.180 --> 02:33:16.120]
Next time you see Joe, give him a big kiss.

That's your well.

[02:33:17.280 --> 02:33:17.520]

[02:33:21.240 --> 02:33:22.340]
He's got a small pier.

[02:33:22.500 --> 02:33:23.420]
Sing the fifth baby.

[02:33:25.680 --> 02:33:26.300]
The fifth baby.

[02:33:26.300 --> 02:33:26.680]
The fifth baby.

[02:33:26.860 --> 02:33:26.880]
The fifth baby.

[02:33:26.880 --> 02:33:28.000]
You need more of the white folks.

[02:33:28.280 --> 02:33:29.200]
Hate the black folks.

[02:33:29.500 --> 02:33:30.420]
And the black folks.

[02:33:30.600 --> 02:33:31.620]
Hate the white folks.

[02:33:31.820 --> 02:33:33.960]
To hate all but the white folks.

[02:33:34.120 --> 02:33:36.580]

National Brotherhood Week.

[02:33:41.640 --> 02:33:46.040]
Lean on horn and sheriff park are dancing cheap to cheegets.

[02:33:46.460 --> 02:33:48.340]
Bones who utilize them.

[02:33:48.780 --> 02:33:53.100]
People you despise as long as you don't let them in your school.

[02:33:56.740 --> 02:33:57.980]
Older poor folks.

[02:33:58.200 --> 02:33:59.040]

All of my folks hate all of your folks.

[02:34:03.620 --> 02:34:05.480]
It's American as apple pie.

National Brotherhood Week.

[02:34:11.420 --> 02:34:15.180]
New Yorkers love the quetz or weekends cause it's very cheap.

[02:34:15.860 --> 02:34:19.960]
Step up and shake the hand of someone you can't stand.

[02:34:20.340 --> 02:34:22.780]
You can tolerate him if you try.

[02:34:26.280 --> 02:34:28.520]
Older Protestants hate the Catholics.

[02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:31.000]
And the Catholics hate the Protestants.

[02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:35.060]
And the Hindus hate the Muslims and everybody hates the Jews.

[02:34:35.120 --> 02:34:35.660]

It's only for a week so have no fear.

[02:34:53.780 --> 02:34:56.760]

[02:35:09.140 --> 02:35:09.760]
Jason Jackson.

[02:35:10.300 --> 02:35:11.460]
Why can't I remember that name?

[02:35:11.880 --> 02:35:14.860]
It's not personally sounded like a real radio person to me.

[02:35:15.120 --> 02:35:16.620]
He sounded like somebody belonged on a year.

[02:35:18.520 --> 02:35:19.320]
You know what I mean?

[02:35:19.480 --> 02:35:20.440]
Oh my God.

[02:35:20.700 --> 02:35:22.120]
Which caresses really revolutionaries.

[02:35:22.220 --> 02:35:22.680]

And they said that that there's a new person an old soft floor to just

[02:36:42.240 --> 02:36:49.160]
Radio personally coming to 790 the ticket. Oh, what a match made in heaven. How do you like that? I love it

[02:36:49.920 --> 02:37:01.520]
Didn't that buddy. I think he got it. Let's call it bottom feeding that's what it's called bottom feeding

[02:37:03.360 --> 02:37:08.660]
Okay, good luck to them. Okay. If you didn't hate New York before to net in you'll hate him in five minutes

[02:37:09.900 --> 02:37:14.880]

116 votes for Joe Castello. Poor Mark. I said we're going to his five. See you should have put them on there together

[02:37:29.740 --> 02:37:33.920]
Because now it's like a you know an ego thing for poor Mark who like I said

[02:37:33.920 --> 02:37:40.060]
Didn't belong on the air in the first place, but yeah, I never stopped us at Q.A.M. WQ. A.M. Hello

[02:37:40.860 --> 02:37:42.080]
Yes, sir

[02:37:45.040 --> 02:37:51.020]
Like it's in pieces from the bridge gender for years and years actually two persons first one was the original call

[02:37:51.980 --> 02:38:01.980]
When yes, oh, maybe when 90 something early 90s early 90s. Wow. I mean 91 and secondly how long before it was like quote him quote like legendary

[02:38:01.980 --> 02:38:06.480]
I don't recall like the inception of it about five minutes right

[02:38:06.480 --> 02:38:11.760]
And then I guess important thanks very much obviously for all the memories and

[02:38:11.760 --> 02:38:12.520]
Oops

[02:38:13.660 --> 02:38:18.420]
Yes, sir. Yes

[02:38:18.420 --> 02:38:22.640]
About one

[02:38:23.700 --> 02:38:24.720]
Big is

[02:38:24.720 --> 02:38:30.900]
Now we're talking about bridges over the causeway not the ones in your mouth. I

[02:38:30.900 --> 02:38:33.980]
Don't have any of my friends. Okay. Yeah

[02:38:36.360 --> 02:38:36.800]
I

[02:38:36.800 --> 02:38:40.360]
Did you know

[02:38:43.500 --> 02:38:49.340]
If I knew that I wouldn't have been asking say but that I said if I knew the answer to the question

[02:38:49.340 --> 02:38:50.800]
I wouldn't have asked it in the first place

[02:38:59.780 --> 02:39:00.660]
Over one

[02:39:00.660 --> 02:39:08.680]
Navigable waterway. Yes, sir. Okay. Okay. Yeah, so it's up to them to decide what time yeah

[02:39:08.680 --> 02:39:13.540]
The bridges should not be open to the marine traffic. Yes

[02:39:13.540 --> 02:39:17.220]
And what time should they not be open to marine traffic, sir?

[02:39:18.360 --> 02:39:23.380]
I'm telling you that they come up with the times. Well, what is the time?

[02:39:24.400 --> 02:39:28.120]
I believe is that wish our times sir

[02:39:29.120 --> 02:39:34.500]
That they are not open to marine traffic other than that they are open to marine traffic

[02:39:34.500 --> 02:39:38.040]
So in other words any slump with a boat can come along and back up traffic for you

[02:39:38.040 --> 02:39:44.000]
Well, what kind of a communist bunch of crap is that that is not a communist bunch of crap

[02:39:44.000 --> 02:39:47.540]
Sounds like some kind of re-indithal fascist army pinko

[02:39:48.460 --> 02:39:49.280]
Fibolacy to me

[02:39:50.760 --> 02:39:51.720]
Wait exactly

[02:39:55.500 --> 02:39:56.100]
I think that

[02:39:56.100 --> 02:40:01.280]
No, I think that 50,000 cars ought to stop for one jackass in his boat. I think that's what they ought to do

[02:40:02.240 --> 02:40:04.300]
Man, you better know your laws, mr

[02:40:04.300 --> 02:40:06.180]
Because you should don't that's right

[02:40:06.180 --> 02:40:10.960]
I just thought you want the man briggas closed to both traffic and a hurricane too

[02:40:10.960 --> 02:40:14.300]
I want the bridges closed period. Okay. I want them closed

[02:40:14.300 --> 02:40:18.140]
I want the bridge tent to go home and watch your MPV and get the hell out of our life

[02:40:18.700 --> 02:40:22.240]
I want those bridges closed let him use the Julia Tuttle, okay?

[02:40:22.580 --> 02:40:24.000]
Let him use them a concept cause

[02:40:24.000 --> 02:40:28.920]
I think they ought to go out of George Washington bridge and jump all of bridge tenters. How do you like that sir?

[02:40:29.520 --> 02:40:33.120]
Well, I don't know about you, but you shot like some stupid idiot

[02:40:33.700 --> 02:40:37.620]
Amen, it's 11 before 2. Thank you right away very much for recommending that

[02:40:38.220 --> 02:40:41.440]
No, it's okay to play once every a couple of years every 5-10 years

[02:40:42.100 --> 02:40:43.340]
Sure, you don't think

[02:40:43.820 --> 02:40:49.060]
It's fun. Anyway, so going to Wikipedia which by the way everybody changes and puts all kind of crap on here

[02:40:49.060 --> 02:40:50.980]
Which is I don't know whether it's fun or just stupid

[02:40:51.800 --> 02:40:56.080]
Moe Howard David which I don't believe for a second. He's going to 790 even Joel Feinberg isn't that stupid

[02:40:56.080 --> 02:40:57.660]
You never know you sure

[02:40:58.400 --> 02:41:04.300]
While working for the dolphin station David became embroiled in a feud with radio personality Neil Rogers who tagged David with the name

[02:41:04.300 --> 02:41:08.960]
Moe Howard David and continuously mock David with three studios type comedy bits featuring

[02:41:08.960 --> 02:41:13.560]
Moe and his sidekick Steve Goldie Goldstein another personality on the same station

[02:41:14.580 --> 02:41:21.160]
Even though David is long gone Rogers and his list who still refer to him and Rogers constantly plays a clip of the Moe character saying

[02:41:21.160 --> 02:41:24.540]
How do you like that on Wikipedia? Not cute

[02:41:24.540 --> 02:41:29.600]
Do you know even though Moe is long gone you don't give him no Moe

[02:41:31.520 --> 02:41:33.860]
That's kind of cute quite yeah

[02:41:34.780 --> 02:41:38.040]

Oh in Miami-Dade County

Because we can't stand people who own pit bulls sir. They're evil and the people who own them are a grotesque

[02:43:11.700 --> 02:43:12.100]
Absolutely

[02:43:14.860 --> 02:43:17.940]
How do you like that there are people who actually haven't heard that bit before

[02:43:17.940 --> 02:43:22.500]
Even my close personal friend the professor Wilson me a message saying now he knows where that comes from

[02:43:22.500 --> 02:43:26.240]
Absolutely correct. I do like that sure to be a feather in my cap
