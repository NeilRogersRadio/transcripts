[00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:07.540]
Goodbye Carl Roll, you're flaming the old conjal mall.

[00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:16.480]
Now you'll have more time for Jeff Datton's you can rest and comfort you, while you tickle his toothy tooth.

[00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:26.260]
Yet dirty pays me back at you and a lousy dancer, wish calling you a turd blossom,

[00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:32.360]
is the only truth that he said, since his ass is where you kept your head.

[00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.580]
The two-joule party with the president.

[00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.460]
You're a recovering queer and prepared fear.

[00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:49.840]
Get the hell out of here, you lying traitors, say bye bye and don't hide it.

[00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:55.440]
Justice, you're a country that's known to still prove that.

[00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.660]
If you wanna put your tongue in some Republican tail,

[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.800]
Reckon's plenty good-crested Republican boyfriend, who's for you, Lindsey?

[00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.260]
A rock.

[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.380]
10-1-5-60, bye bye, WQ-I-M.

[00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.460]
Anyway, we got the Adolf and Kansas City game coming up for tonight.

[00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.360]
Trent Green gonna be starting against his former team.

[00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.760]
Is that correct or do they change that?

[00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:17.680]
Absolutely correct.

[00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:18.980]
Well, how do you like that?

[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.360]
He just turned 85, Trent.

[00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.040]
He used to look really good too and played pretty good, but he's 100 years old.

[00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.640]
It's part of the ongoing saga.

[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.940]
Very sad.

[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.420]
But we had Ethan Skolnik on again this morning.

[00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.360]
Hey, great having you with us Ethan.

[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.760]
Don't give me started on that again, okay?

[00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:35.980]
I don't wanna stand on that again.

[00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.280]
I wanna know Charlie, George will be pleased to know I got a quick return message from your friend, the Z-Man.

[00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.840]
Good.

[00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.860]
From my friend, well my former friend, but now everybody is your friend.

[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.500]
See that's out there everybody already George.

[00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.020]
Thank you.

[00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.780]
Well, you know what it is, it's out of sight out of mind.

[00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:49.400]
That's the thing.

[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.240]
I'm never on anymore and you're on all the time.

[00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.380]
And so I'm like, I'm old news man.

[00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.940]
I'm like old ancient names potatoes, you know.

[00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.780]
Just throw them in the toilet and flush them down.

[00:01:58.860 --> 00:01:59.240]
That's me.

[00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.820]
I used to be a pretty popular guy a long time ago.

[00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.960]
Way back when.

[00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.960]
The interior ministry in Baghdad said today that at least 500 people were killed in the spring of suicide.

[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.200]
Bobby is targeting an ancient religious sect in Northwestern Iraq earlier this week.

[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.420]
Targeting an ancient religious sect.

[00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.160]
How do you like that?

[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.060]
Part of these things.

[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.360]

[00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.160]
All these religious sects.

[00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.280]
Very sad, but you people won't listen to me or anybody else with an IQ larger than their thumbnail.

[00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.120]
Oh, the good lord says.

[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.540]
Just like all those idiots in Utah, they're praying for the miners, okay.

[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.800]
A lot of those polygamists start there praying for some good miners too, but that's a different kind of miner.

[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:39.660]
But is the lord listening?

[00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.800]
I told you before the show today, the lord is busy.

[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.300]
He's got a lot of ball games coming up.

[00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.840]
A lot of football. He's got to fix the morning line and place his bets and get all the book he's all straightened out.

[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.220]
He don't have time for like no dying miners.

[00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.040]
So what do you think they've been in their 10 days?

[00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.200]
Do you think there's any chance that any of them are still alive?

[00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.740]
No.

[00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.440]
No.

[00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.160]
But I'm praying too.

[00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:00.840]
Are you praying for them?

[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.640]
Yes. To all the gods.

[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:05.760]
How about...

[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:06.420]
Damn god!

[00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:07.180]
Him too.

[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.960]
The seasons first hurricane formed this morning in the Atlantic and ruled relentlessly toward the outer Caribbean islands.

[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:14.620]
Oh my god.

[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.320]
I wouldn't get all panicky though.

[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.140]
Well, this is only the first one. What's today? Today it's only the 16th of Augusto.

[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:22.960]
Jesus Christ.

[00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:30.380]
Hurricane Dean was nearly 2000 miles from South Florida and forecasted as expected to move well south of South Florida this weekend.

[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:35.280]
Don't get all panicky and nervous in jerky and start running around, buying up all year of viscuing,

[00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:39.240]
plowing, all the bottled water and all that other crap.

[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.660]
But residents of the Caribbean though stood in a high alert.

[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.320]
Dean still had a lot more powerful with satellite images beginning to show the voices of a classic Hurricane I.

[00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:58.180]
Hurricane warnings were watched as reported in Dominica, San Lucia, Marthinique, Guadalupe, Saba. What is Saba?

[00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.540]
I stilt you.

[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.920]
I never heard anyone who was last to Saba and St. Eustaceus.

[00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:05.440]
I heard that one.

[00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:07.900]
You have? Yeah.

[00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.720]
Tropical storm warnings were watched as were issued for St. Martin, St. Vincent and Barbados.

[00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:17.800]
All the saints, baby. I think the Lord is once again got bad aim when those saints go marching in.

[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:23.280]
Dean was expected to reach the islands by tomorrow morning, possibly as a category to a hurricane with winds of 100 miles an hour.

[00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:30.500]
Forecast is word of high tides, battering waves, and two to five inches of rain with some mountainous areas, possibly receiving seven inches.

[00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:38.600]
These rains could become a cause life threatening flash floods and mudslots at Hurricane Specialist Jack Bevin of the National Hurricane Center West Aid.

[00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:50.600]
Then Dean was predicted to continue heading west or north west, possibly endangering La Republic of Dominicana, Haiti, Jamaica, Cuba, and Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula this weekend and the world next week.

[00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:58.840]
Worst was expected to intensify Maitoli approaching Jamaica as a major category three and possibly reaching the Yucatan as a monstrous category four.

[00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:03.360]
Access to category four, but a monstrous category four. Wow.

[00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:09.360]
There appears to be little to keep Dean from strengthening through the forecast period, Bevin said.

[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.680]
And then they had their earthquake in Peru, does anybody care about that? No. No.

[00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:21.400]
What we're so used to is, you know, big clumps of dead people. I mean, there's only like how many people died in Peru? I just missed the number on that. I don't know.

[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:28.420]
I mean, it's not nothing. Not even close to that 500 that died and that religious, that bizarre religious sect, it'll teach them.

[00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:32.400]
It'll teach them to this, what's his name, I'm a hammered.

[00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:34.800]
Wown it right. Allah.

[00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:43.480]
George yesterday, I guess on Tuesday, he tried to take my advice. He thought that if he put his poll for yesterday on Erwin.

[00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:50.900]
I'm going to push it, but I didn't. He would get to 1000 votes. Not only did he not get to 1000 votes during the show, he didn't get to 1000 votes total.

[00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:57.660]
Right. Total. Well, you changed the question. He's pretty embarrassed about it. Oh, I'm totally embarrassed.

[00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:03.800]
When you went out to take a joy, he got all he got on and was like, Ah, that George, you can't get to 1000 votes.

[00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:10.220]
He said you could start to pull it like six o'clock in the morning before and you still couldn't get to 1000 votes. I don't know what that means.

[00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:14.920]
I said that at George said that. You said that. No, because I was the one that was taking the joy. He'll said that.

[00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:21.320]
Oh, okay. Here's the poll from yesterday. George is great poll that went over like Halaba in Utah.

[00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:27.300]
Who's your favorite TV moralizer? I thought a bad poll question. Is this a Charlie B?

[00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:33.920]
It's not a Charlie B. Listen, we appreciate all the polls over the one I took today. I only took it because he prodded me to do it.

[00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:44.640]
He sent me the most embarrassing email. Just embarrassing and apologizing for putting a Mark's brothers next to Raucho yesterday.

[00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:49.780]
Or Tuesday, whatever. All this other, hey Charlie, get a life where you're pleased. I have no life. Stop.

[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:57.620]
We appreciate it, but you take it so damn seriously. It's just a radio show. It's not the end of the world. It's just some stupid ass poll on the internet.

[00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:06.980]
God, Charlie. Favorite TV moralizer? Judge Judy wins in a landslide in a glanslide. 262. She's a hell of a guy. Judge Judy.

[00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:12.980]
Do you have that stranger? You never gave that to me by the way. I don't even have that like conveniently located.

[00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:18.240]
You don't have it at all? No, I have it. It's just I don't have it at this point. It's just a stranger.

[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:24.260]
I have to write a note. He's got two, so you have to write a note. I used to hate her like boys and benign realize that she's a, you know.

[00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:33.200]
Right. She's just for yucks. John Walsh from Amurface most one in 184. Chris Hansen from the Kinscher Predator 171.

[00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:38.740]
All then my preverts man. All the people did them little girls, little boys. Lou Dom's 131.

[00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:45.280]
I think we ought to deport his ass. Although that would take a lot of your crane to do that. He's got a big fan ass.

[00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:50.980]
Oprah 76. Mori Povice 43. Whatever happened to Walsh is his Chinese wife.

[00:07:52.080 --> 00:08:00.360]
Kadi Kachonik. Kadi Kachonik. She's there still doing it, I guess. Doing his junk. Dr. Phil 43 and neck.

[00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:05.460]
Oh, what a thought. I want to vomit. I'm baking this morning. Oh, it's making a comeback.

[00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:10.920]
And Nancy Grace 27. Everybody hates her like poison and rightfully so. Moralizer. My ass.

[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:16.540]
Well, friend. Thank you, friend. Oh, God. Is she sick and disgusting and revolting?

[00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:21.740]
That's why she's on TV and watched by millions and making millions because she's disgusting and revolting.

[00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:30.180]
Anyway, I did take Charlie B's pull about the Godfather. I'm not taking the other ones about who should have played Michael and who should have played Tom Hagen.

[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:35.860]
I mean, come on Charlie. Get a life already. Please. I have no life. We know that. We got 640.

[00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:42.620]
If we do 1000 on this pool today, I'm going to tell you I'm retiring. That should be an incentive you watch.

[00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:46.300]
I didn't say when I'm going to retire. I just said if we do it.

[00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:52.080]
No, it's not always leave it open like that. Let's take a look at the schedule before we look at this pool result.

[00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:58.560]
And today is Thursday. So we got a great restaurant again. Really great looking place. Prime blue grill. Have you ever eaten there?

[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:02.200]
No, but you will soon because it brings us to what time?

[00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:09.600]
11 something 11 is 11 30 maybe great just in tender. Able to so that it knew when we put those certificates on sale.

[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:15.080]
They're going to go out like hotcakes. Well, you sure sold out last week real fast. I think you bought my 14 minutes.

[00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:21.340]
14 minutes. So don't be picking on George. See I'm gagging again about the thinking about more.

[00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:29.400]
Poverches junk. Let's see. Today here's the schedule mad dog in Kansas City. Of course, because he's got to do the collar on the game.

[00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:29.880]
Oh, right.

[00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:37.020]
Then we got our 85 hours of pregame, you know, because on WQ and the dolphins are just a team.

[00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:42.340]
It's not just a ballgame. It's a sickness. It's an erosus. It's an obsession. It's insanity.

[00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:46.860]
Countdown to kick off live. Fort away this afternoon. We know who's going to be on that thing.

[00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:49.340]
Danny Knell.

[00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:56.440]
There you go. The big O. Rock solid who got pace. O's a gaki. Me foe in the last book.

[00:09:56.440 --> 00:10:03.240]
Boy, I don't know. Joe Zagaki. Holy cow. Anyway, eight o'clock. The dolphins at Kansas City to play the chiefs.

[00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:11.500]
And then after the game, it's Fin's final. Filamente. The Marlon game will be on 940, which I don't understand that because that's cheap channel.

[00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:17.480]
How can we have an association with them with those bastards? Do you understand that? No. I can't understand.

[00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:22.880]
We farmed up to KAT because they got nothing but Hungarian melodies and stuff. But 940, scared America.

[00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:28.720]
Used to be W. I. and Z when they had call letters 940 for the Marlon game against Arizona.

[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:32.540]
Well, it's a meaningless game. Marlon's really have no shot at the wild card. Am I right about that Chris?

[00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:38.920]
And by the way, a cup on Tuesday, you really led me down the garden path when I said the Yankees were 7,000 games behind.

[00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:41.700]
If that 10, they were only four games behind. I said no, not really.

[00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:47.800]
Yeah, but you didn't say only four. Solomente Quattro. Now they've lost a couple.

[00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:55.140]
I believe to Baltimore in the road. They're like six, but they were getting dangerously close to Boston who are notorious for choking and gagging and puking.

[00:10:55.440 --> 00:11:00.780]
Not the last time, but most times, almost every time. Look at that. The Dow is down 123 points.

[00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:05.720]
Boy, that's sad for you fools off there that continue. You know, here comes the buddy and there goes your money.

[00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:11.760]
At least it would buy. I get a, you know, I get some entertainment that I mentioned. I want a grander yesterday morning. Did I mention that in an hour?

[00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:15.960]
No, you didn't. And you're not getting any.

[00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:19.480]
Six hundred sixty votes on the pool. We'll get to it in a minute after the break.

[00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:25.560]
And I'm going to say it again. I think it took a lot of courage and desperation in my part to put that pool on there.

[00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:30.720]
I don't want to rip Charlie B. I have no life. I think it'd be one of his worst pools of all time. It's just so stupid.

[00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:36.660]
And especially the fact that nobody else could have played that role is winning by a landslide. And I put that on there.

[00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:43.060]
Charlie B did not have that on there. He just had the names. I had it. Nobody else could have done it. Could have do it. Charlie.

[00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:46.240]
Hey Charlie get with it. I have no life. I have a bitch.

[00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:48.940]
Absolutely.

[00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:51.820]
Do it, do it, do it, do it.

[00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:55.120]
Do it, do it, do it, do it.

[00:11:55.220 --> 00:12:02.040]
Hey kids, shut up your computers. That's because the internet is ruined my music.

[00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:06.240]
You can't make a decent song if you do it online.

[00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:08.500]
Do it, do it, do it.

[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:14.020]
I should know I haven't written a good song since 79.

[00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:22.880]
Yeah, my face with you, you've got a soul of a sift. That's why I'm so free now.

[00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:25.460]
But they me internet.

[00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:33.240]
Sure I love the piece, that's wonderful. But the block in it's what I've seen.

[00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:43.060]
Don't have to prove a lie. Because I'm a lie. But I'm acting like a spiderwee of gold.

[00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:46.340]
But lately internet.

[00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:53.440]
They know, they know. They know. They know.

[00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:58.260]
671 votes. We're going to have 700 before we know. We're going to do 1000 a day.

[00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:03.260]
I'm one of the most embarrassing bad polls I've ever taken. I'm really a good, that's a real feather in my ass.

[00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:08.020]
Now speaking of that, I see on a Hascom this, there's a cut on here. I haven't really listened to these yet.

[00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:11.180]
You know, I've written tributes on it. Have you listened to that?

[00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:11.660]
Yes.

[00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:12.880]
Short.

[00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:53.440]
Oh boy, that really blows. Anyway, here's the applause. You're right. But it killed 38 seconds.

[00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:58.040]
I mean, butchered it. You won't hear that on the acid. The inshawagurante of that.

[00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:09.000]
671 votes on the pool today. If Marlon Brando hadn't played Don Vito Cholione in the godfather, which of these other actors, all of whom were considered for the role.

[00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:13.660]
That's the important part to coin a Charlie B, I guess, when you were preferred to play Don Vito Cholione.

[00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:21.980]
675 votes and 247 say nobody else could have do it. That's my choice. I made that up, Charlie B. How do you like that?

[00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:26.220]
And that's winning by a glanslide. Nobody else could have been Don Vito Cholione.

[00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:28.720]
Are we right about that or why?

[00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:29.020]

[00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:31.960]
What's the matter with you?

[00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:34.320]
I think your brand is going to solve.

[00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:42.580]
Anthony Quinn, though, of the actual names is winning hands down your pants. Anthony Quinn 172 could have been one of the ugliest people ever to be in Hollywood.

[00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:46.920]
He was really grotesque. He had, like, I just grotesque.

[00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:52.840]
George C. Scott 61. What is the big simmiss with him? Don't you think he was one of the most over-weighted actors? He's dead by the way.

[00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:59.080]
I didn't think he was overrated. I thought he was really just fine. He was in some movies and, you know, he did just fine.

[00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:04.860]
No, they always see you're just traveling in the right circles. I know, I guess not. I don't hang with movie suits.

[00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:09.800]
No, I always talked about him being one of the great actors of all time. I never heard that.

[00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:13.740]
I was always down to Hal Hulbrook, which I also don't understand that. I mean, he was neither of great actors.

[00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:16.480]
I never heard anybody say that about George C. Scott. No.

[00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:21.600]
Anyway, that's what they said. I don't understand. He had an ego that was bigger than his schnauz.

[00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:24.360]
And then he was married to a trish bandermere or whatever her name was.

[00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:26.800]
Kushmer and Toss was editing? Sure.

[00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:31.600]
And he was on Hollywood Square, and she was always on there, too. And he was always plugger and plugger.

[00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:38.420]
Oh, I guess that's what it was all about, isn't it? George C. Scott, 61, Frank Sinatra, 38,

[00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:40.560]
wouldn't that have been ironic, huh? The Snotman.

[00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:46.680]
Orson Wells, 36, whose main talent I think was being bigger than a mountain, bigger than Hank.

[00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:52.920]
Edward G. Robinson, 36. You know, I mean, he was a great gangster guy, but the Godfather was not, you know,

[00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:56.880]
not that kind of a gangster, was he? No.

[00:15:56.880 --> 00:16:01.280]
Edward G. Robinson always played kind of a crude, you know, crude and lude.

[00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:05.680]
I earned his Burgneye in 31. Oh, yeah. How about the Don Nats?

[00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:07.840]
I earned his Burgneye.

[00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:11.620]
Lorenzo Olivier, 16. Orch Olivier rhymes with him and Danny K.

[00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:14.000]
I've had a little thing going.

[00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:18.600]
Berlancaster, 16. Danny Thomas, 14. And Carlo Punti has got eight.

[00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:20.020]
How do you get a 678?

[00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:22.880]
It's a horrible pull. I mean, why did I...

[00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:27.540]
Well, the reason I did is because I got this long email like I told you from Charlie B.

[00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:28.300]
I have no line.

[00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:32.960]
Oh, you know, you're so Godfather intensive and I thought, but it'd be pitiful to put about all this other crap.

[00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:33.540]
So, okay.

[00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:36.020]
It's in my dwindling pile.

[00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:41.220]
By the way, is he sent you anything new lately? Instead of giving me a solid dance about how I should use these bad old ones, Charlie,

[00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:42.860]
how about coming up with something new?

[00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:45.660]
So, we don't have to do that. Wouldn't that be good?

[00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:47.420]
Okay.

[00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:55.180]
Something new and exciting besides the same rehashed pile that I've had sitting here for since the Pope was a baby for Christ's sake.

[00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:58.260]
What's your take on very bonds, Brick and R?

[00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:00.040]
I mean, what kind of a pull is that?

[00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:05.460]
Other than Neil and George, who's been your favorite pairing of honor and town? And of course, George and Lucy Lopez.

[00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:06.740]
Lucy?

[00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:07.300]
Yeah.

[00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:15.160]
Oh, look at this. How long do you think it'll be before I've seen words like Schmidt and the F word become acceptable on sensitive and radio and TV?

[00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:18.820]
You know, Charlie, you remind me of a great read.

[00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:25.020]
Just when everything is going in the other direction, you're like, oh, well, let's put Forella on here. Let's put Stern on, you know.

[00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:26.660]
Not good timing.

[00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:32.480]
I say about 90% of things in life are timing, like that old bag lady that 100 grand it would buy in last week.

[00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:33.640]
That was a surprise.

[00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:39.100]
Everybody's still fetching about that. Oh my God, she looked like crap.

[00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:42.320]
And you know something? She went 100 grand and I guarantee she still looks like crap.

[00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:46.980]
How many games of the dolphins win this? I mean, what we've done that before that.

[00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:49.260]
And he chastised me because we've done it before.

[00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:55.740]
So, well, you did that pull before what's wrong with that? Well, don't, don't feed us back the say that it's like when you take calls, you know.

[00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:57.760]
And they repeat back to what you just got through saying.

[00:17:58.640 --> 00:17:58.960]
Right.

[00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:00.560]
You know exactly what I'm talking about.

[00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:00.800]
Oh, you're talking about it.

[00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:01.880]
I know exactly what you're talking about.

[00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:04.740]
Do you? Well, that's because you take calls. Not me.

[00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:06.420]
Somebody QIM, hello.

[00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:07.160]
My birthday.

[00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:09.880]
No, no, no, good. Hopefully the last.

[00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:11.860]
My birthday.

[00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:14.720]
That's the first call I've taken the long time.

[00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:15.300]
And you know what?

[00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:17.020]
Last.

[00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:20.060]
My birthday.

[00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:23.060]
Keith Oberman on Monday.

[00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:26.440]
Remember, he used to like Keith on the show before he became a real rat.

[00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:31.060]
And Rip Dimes and Asking God is, although it looks like Amos is getting 20 million from CBS.

[00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:32.380]
Oh, it's not about the money.

[00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:35.460]
No. And he's going to go to WABC.

[00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:36.020]
It looks like.

[00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:40.620]
I say more power to the old coup.

[00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:47.560]
Keith Oberman on Monday recalled from viewers in incident 34 years ago last Friday when a story appeared in the Washington Post detailing.

[00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:55.240]
A Republican National Committee probe of then 22 year old Carl Rove, who had been teaching political dirty tricks to his fellow college Republicans.

[00:18:56.020 --> 00:19:03.860]
As a result of that probe, Rove was hired by RNC head George Herbert Walker Bush and made the acquaintance of then 2070 year old George W. Bush.

[00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:06.620]
W. Asking, what?

[00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:07.580]
Is it?

[00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:18.880]
Oberman then welcomed James Moore author of Bush's Brain, how Carl Rove made George W. Bush presidential, and asked him, what does Mr. Bush become when he has to operate without role for the first time in his political life?

[00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:21.660]
Moore said he goes from lame duck to lame brain.

[00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:24.460]
The presidency is going to achieve nothing.

[00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:28.640]
There's nothing left he can accomplish domestically. The war is a mess. And Carl is radioactive.

[00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:34.440]
Isn't that us here on QMR, are we radioactive? Don't you like that? That would be a good slogan wouldn't it?

[00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:35.080]
Yeah, what?

[00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:37.980]
560 QAM were radioactive.

[00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:39.020]
And you?

[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:40.620]
That's the thing.

[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:41.140]
Yeah.

[00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:47.820]
When Oberman asked if Rove was really going to stay out of the 2008 campaign, we'll reply, even a shark gets a belly full every now and then.

[00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:50.520]
And this is a chance for this guy to cash in on his reputation.

[00:19:51.080 --> 00:20:04.540]
I think the most important thing this guy wants to do is sit down and write his first draft, his version of history so they can put his definitive spin on eight years of the Bush administration, and hopes that history will judge them a bit more kindly than everybody expects history to judge them.

[00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:09.560]
Oberman then asked whether people might start coming out of the woodwork and filling in the blanks of Rove's career.

[00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:14.000]
You'll like to believe that we're all at least have a shred of humanity and we'll have a moment of atonement said more.

[00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:15.380]
I don't think Carl does.

[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:23.080]
I think that there's a certain part of this guy that is pathological and he has a happy little movie in his head that he's watching and creates a reality that he refers to.

[00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:26.800]
And that's what sustains him and the people who support him and they're an absolute denial.

[00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:30.960]
I don't know that these people are going to talk any time in the near future, he'd be saying.

[00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:42.980]
If Rove is so smart, how come they'd lost Congress over when I asked what Carl has done throughout the years and has turned everything political said more, federal agencies are used to accumulate political power, everything they did was to accumulate political power.

[00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:52.000]
And eventually what happened was that when those agencies were called on to serve the constituencies elected people to Washington, when they were unable to do that, the public finally said, okay, we've had enough.

[00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:52.880]
Are you sure?

[00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:53.200]
Yes.

[00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:55.820]
Okay, we've had Ginoge is what they say.

[00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:57.000]
But this is good.

[00:20:57.540 --> 00:20:58.080]
I'm talking.

[00:20:58.240 --> 00:20:59.280]
What does he know from Ginoge, right?

[00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:00.080]
Right.

[00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:11.860]
Ginoge to those Chinese products, too, by the way, if it's made in China, don't buy it, don't eat it, don't touch it, don't drink it, don't smell it, don't sniff it, don't snort it, don't inject it, don't be doing it.

[00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:13.320]
Is that correct?

[00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:15.100]
That is absolutely, wait a minute.

[00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:15.800]
Absolutely.

[00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:16.700]
Correct.

[00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:17.360]
Sir.

[00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:19.320]
688 votes on the poll.

[00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:22.380]
We've got to get way over 700 by the top of the air and then we've got a chance of a thousand.

[00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:24.440]
In which case you're going to be pretty embarrassed.

[00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:30.280]
And by the way, the FedEx guy up there, Connecticut Tony, yeah, George was really pissed off of me on Tuesday.

[00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:33.740]
New York.

[00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:40.420]
You're fairy.

[00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:43.660]
Back in the day when someone done us wrong.

[00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:47.000]
We didn't take their crap.

[00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:53.640]
In Pearl Harbor, when the Japs dropped their bombs, we bombed them bad.

[00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:54.480]
That's the mean.

[00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:57.480]
Now the Saudis made it us hard.

[00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:00.740]
And on our cards are little flags' waves.

[00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:07.460]
Has that Saudi-Lumin retard voice of bombers the wrong way?

[00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:18.240]
And other barriers could be in America's where they follow those like she's.

[00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:23.620]
The United States of America's led by Bush and his family.

[00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:25.640]
They got this country.

[00:22:27.420 --> 00:22:30.720]
Ambulant or the largest days in our history.

[00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:35.060]
I don't want to be a Pax America.

[00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:39.520]
In the USA.

[00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:44.840]
Look at that, the market's down 170.

[00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:48.260]
What's a few thousand innocent lives?

[00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:50.900]
Stop living in the past.

[00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:57.900]
If you want that SUV to drive, you're going to need more gas.

[00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:02.340]
It's the greatest country in the world.

[00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:04.520]
They train us to believe.

[00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:12.000]
And anyone who says that obviously, enter for to be.

[00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:21.740]
I have no right and I'm embarrassed to be in America's where we take three off of Italy.

[00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:25.900]
Wema flagged what had with our head in the sand.

[00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:29.820]
It's lightly followed the powers that be apathetic.

[00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:35.740]
Washington State Produced on a 65 in screen.

[00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:39.760]
Scratcher, five, everything's okay.

[00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:43.940]
England, USA.

[00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:45.980]
The French and Paul's in front.

[00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:47.380]
I think we can actually still say that.

[00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:49.080]
We might give it a shot.

[00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:49.800]
It happens.

[00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:52.080]
10.33 at 5.60 WDQAM.

[00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:53.360]
Happy Thursday, Elle.

[00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:54.740]
And the East is Tuesday of Wosto.

[00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:57.700]
Well, am I good with my numbers or what?

[00:23:58.220 --> 00:23:58.540]
Seek.

[00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:00.220]
I've seen a few good numbers in my time.

[00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:01.500]
Believe you may.

[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.040]
698 votes on the pool.

[00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:04.920]
If you flip that thing, you might have 700.

[00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:06.080]
No, I tried it.

[00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:08.860]
Where it says view current, you know, Chris, where it says the thing on there?

[00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:10.480]
Yeah, still 698.

[00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:14.900]
If Marlon Brando hadn't played Don Vito Corleone in the Godfather, who should have done it?

[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:15.580]
Who should have do it?

[00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:17.700]
698 votes.

[00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:18.760]
Nobody else could have done it.

[00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:19.520]
255.

[00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:22.100]
Who else would have stuck all that cotton, batten, and their cheek?

[00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:23.920]
Right?

[00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:24.800]
Right.

[00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:27.000]
Maybe Joseph Cotton would have been good.

[00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:33.040]
And Charlie B, of course, only includes the list of names of those who were actually considered for the role.

[00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:36.140]
So those who might want to add on to this, bug off.

[00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:36.840]
Get lost.

[00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:39.280]
Anthony Quinn.

[00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:41.360]
Tony Quinn is way ahead of everybody else.

[00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:41.800]
180.

[00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:44.500]
Is that because he was big and had a gigantic head?

[00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:45.580]
Sure.

[00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:47.220]
And very kind of almanic guy.

[00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:47.940]
Tony Quinn.

[00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:49.160]
He was uglier so.

[00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:49.780]
Very bad.

[00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:51.940]
George C. Scott, 66.

[00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:53.600]
Frank Snatra, 38.

[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.840]
Who never spoke to Al Martino again.

[00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:59.540]
I guess he won't know either after the Godfather.

[00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:01.200]
He never would speak to Al Martino again.

[00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:06.640]
Because everybody knew that the character that Al Martino played was Frank Snatra.

[00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:08.680]
It was Tommy Dorsey Band, that whole story.

[00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:09.260]
I've told you that.

[00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:09.660]
Yes.

[00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:11.080]
And everybody knows that.

[00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:11.980]
Well, what's wrong with that?

[00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:12.540]
Nothing.

[00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:17.900]
I'm looking for that drop in, where you can be a man.

[00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:18.520]
What is that?

[00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:19.220]
What does that call?

[00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:20.240]
I'd like a man.

[00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:22.700]
Act like a man.

[00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:23.860]
Every that by the four seasons.

[00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:24.820]
The walk like a girl.

[00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:26.320]
You're gonna act like a man.

[00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:27.080]
What's the matter?

[00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:28.840]
What's the matter from you?

[00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:31.200]
See, I can't imagine Frank Snatra doing that.

[00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:31.920]
No.

[00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:32.400]
No.

[00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:33.640]
Orson Wells, 37.

[00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:35.240]
Edward G. Robinson, 37.

[00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:36.440]
He was Jewish, by the way.

[00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:38.280]
Ernest Borgmine, 31.

[00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:39.640]
Lawrence Olivier, 16.

[00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:41.300]
Bird Lancaster, 16.

[00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:44.000]
Danny Thomas, who was Lesbianese or something like that.

[00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:45.300]
Siri and Lesbianese, 14.

[00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:48.420]
And Carlo Ponte, who I think wasn't even very disafieldy around.

[00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:50.420]
I don't know.

[00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:52.560]
One to see where Google is.

[00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:54.940]
Instead of giving me a stupid answer like that, Google it.

[00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:55.660]
Okay.

[00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:56.240]
Who?

[00:25:56.580 --> 00:25:57.660]
Google, Google, Google, Google, Google.

[00:25:57.980 --> 00:25:58.040]
Who?

[00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:00.180]
Carlo Ponte, PO NTI.

[00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:00.720]
Come on.

[00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:02.440]
Eight, eight votes for him.

[00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:04.180]
And it stuck at 690.

[00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:07.340]
And I think as soon as I said 700, no, now there's a big chunk.

[00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:08.060]
710.

[00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:09.240]
What the hell happened there?

[00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:09.800]
710.

[00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:10.980]
That used to be WGBS.

[00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:13.020]
And now it's a radio-mombine.

[00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:14.860]
No, say, Abel, English, IE.

[00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:15.200]
Yes.

[00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:16.240]
I beg your pardon.

[00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:16.680]
He was murdered.

[00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:17.160]
Yeah, for your own.

[00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:19.500]
That was his claim to fame.

[00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:21.320]
I don't think he was a great actor, but he was murdered, too.

[00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:23.200]
In fact, wasn't he a director or something?

[00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:24.480]
I don't think he even wasn't an actor.

[00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:24.800]
Was he?

[00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:25.600]
I don't know.

[00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:26.120]
I guess he was.

[00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:26.920]
I don't know.

[00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:29.240]
Once upon a time, maybe not an American.

[00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:30.980]
710 votes.

[00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:32.620]
So you know what that means, Chris, don't you?

[00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:33.760]
Nothing.

[00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:38.240]
Oh, wait, that's George's thing.

[00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:42.520]
Is George getting you again on those Monday, Wednesday, and Friday shows he getting you about this poll?

[00:26:42.980 --> 00:26:43.240]
I know.

[00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:44.380]
He didn't mention it all yesterday.

[00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:45.240]
He didn't push it.

[00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:47.220]
And he didn't get the thousand votes.

[00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:48.740]
If you don't push it, you're not going to get it.

[00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:50.040]
That's what I heard.

[00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:52.900]
Now, what time is the food coming in?

[00:26:53.140 --> 00:26:53.780]
Sometimes the next hour.

[00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:54.840]
Don't forget we got those certificates.

[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:55.880]
This looks like a real win.

[00:26:55.940 --> 00:26:56.700]
They've all been good.

[00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:58.780]
All the places we've had on here have been really great.

[00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:02.420]
And this place is called the Prime Blue Grill.

[00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:05.520]
It's on South Biscayne.

[00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:08.920]
Have you looked at the other website?

[00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:10.260]
Well, what a beautiful place.

[00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:10.780]
Man.

[00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:12.660]
And especially on the inside.

[00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:13.880]
Look at the decor of that, George.

[00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:15.860]
Just absolutely breathtaking.

[00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:18.020]
Almost enough to make me wish I was down there.

[00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:19.040]
Almost.

[00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:19.780]
Do you notice that?

[00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:20.860]
I heard that.

[00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:24.620]
Who was it that said, when are you going to, oh yeah, it was my good friend for a ride.

[00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:25.220]
Shave a ride.

[00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:29.000]
Thanks for the response for the reply that is and the response.

[00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:32.500]
And no, I'm not going to be in South Biscayne anytime soon.

[00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:33.400]
Please.

[00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:38.320]
Every now and then I sneak in there for three, four days and that's way way more than enough.

[00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:39.460]
Oh my God.

[00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:40.120]
What a place.

[00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:43.760]
And then of course I had that very pleasant trip back up here last time was good too.

[00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:46.280]
Robert's here, right?

[00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:47.520]
Hillary pushes the button.

[00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:50.080]
You know something about her that more I see her, you know what?

[00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:51.240]
What?

[00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:51.780]
You hate her?

[00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:53.020]
Less than like, yeah, me too.

[00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:57.480]
I know that gets a lot of my liberal friends out there very upset a lot of my dad.

[00:27:57.480 --> 00:27:57.880]
Too bad.

[00:27:58.300 --> 00:27:58.980]
Well, too bad.

[00:27:59.080 --> 00:27:59.660]
That's my opinion.

[00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:00.920]
I don't like her.

[00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:04.320]
And she, you know, what they're saying is correct.

[00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:06.300]
She's the most polarizing of all the candidates.

[00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:08.960]
Because people either like her a lot of the heater like poison.

[00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:10.580]
And I'll give you a clue.

[00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:11.540]
I don't like her a lot.

[00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:15.800]
Robert Scheer says one of the world was Senator Hillary Clinton thinking when she attacked

[00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:19.060]
Barack Obama for the ruling off the use of nuclear weapons and going after some of the

[00:28:19.060 --> 00:28:23.660]
blood and why aren't her supporters more concerned about yet another egregious example of Clinton's

[00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:27.520]
consistent backing for the mindless militarism that's dragging the nation to ruin.

[00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:31.780]
So what that she's pro-choice and a woman if the price of proving her capacity between

[00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:34.880]
the Rene chief is that we end up with an American version of Margaret Thatcher.

[00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:40.760]
In response to the 911 hijackers armed with weapons and no more sophisticated and treat-dollar box-cutters,

[00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:46.520]
American military spending with Senate Armed Services Committee member Clinton's enthusiastic support has cut up a catapult

[00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:47.780]
and be on clueless levels.

[00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:53.220]
Senator Clinton has treated the military budget as primarily a pork-berele target of opportunity for jobs

[00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:57.580]
and profit in New York State, supports increased money for missile defense and every other rack at the military

[00:28:57.580 --> 00:29:03.060]
industrial complex comes up with, and still feels no obligation to repudiate her vote for the disastrous or disastrous

[00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:03.320]
war.

[00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:08.400]
Given her sorry record of cheerleading the irrational post-Core World Cold War military build-up,

[00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:15.000]
do we not have a right, indeed an obligation to question Clinton over whether Clinton is committed to creating a more peaceful world?

[00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:19.460]
It's a typo and here nice go on new people at the Smirking Champ Typo.

[00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:26.120]
Don't say that we weren't warned if a president Hillary Clinton further impurls our world as she has clearly positioned herself as

[00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:27.780]
the leading hawk in the democratic field.

[00:29:27.780 --> 00:29:33.680]
One other reason was there for blasting Obama for daring to stay to meet with foreign leaders who bushes branded his sworn enemies

[00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:39.700]
and then for the attack on Obama's very sensible statement that it would be a profound mistake to use nuclear weapons in Pakistan and Afghanistan

[00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:42.280]
and the attempt to eliminate bin Laden, Osama Yamama.

[00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:49.040]
Isn't that a no-brainer or can Clinton conceive of an occasion where even the threat, little on the actuality of a nuclear attack and immediate neighborhood of

[00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:51.520]
nuclear armed Pakistan, India, would send a right message?

[00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:54.920]
And what about the dangerous message of Clinton's assault on Obama?

[00:29:54.920 --> 00:30:00.000]
I don't believe that any president should make any blanket statements with respect to the use or non-use of nuclear weapons.

[00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:01.720]
Huh? He asks, huh?

[00:30:02.540 --> 00:30:07.360]
Just exactly how does one make a compelling case to other nations against the chloro-poral-affiruation nuclear weapons?

[00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:13.120]
When members of the New Club, especially the president of One Nation, it's killed hundreds of thousands of people with two of these ungodly weapons.

[00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:18.340]
Well, a lot of the very least promised to have stained from first use of a weapon that could quite easily eliminate most life on his planet.

[00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:23.760]
Of course, Obama was right and it was no different than Senator Clinton's statement in April 2006 when she said,

[00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:28.700]
I would certainly take nuclear weapons off the table in relation to preventing Iran from developing such weapons.

[00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:34.720]
Back then, she recognized that nuclear weapons are weapons against civilization, not a means of ensuring it's survival.

[00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:40.900]
This administration has been very willing to talk about using nuclear weapons in a way we haven't seen since the Donald nuclear age, she said.

[00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:42.380]
I think that's a terrible mistake.

[00:30:42.380 --> 00:30:49.820]
Yes, indeed, in Hillary's supporters will not insist this statement reflects her true feelings on the matter and that militarist Hillary is just an act to get elected.

[00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:52.000]
Actor reality, it's working.

[00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:56.400]
Pundits for the National Review, the weekly standard other pro-war outlets have come to a plot Clinton.

[00:30:56.760 --> 00:31:04.040]
A host of political scientists and other campaign hustlers have also proved this image makeover as a recent Boston Globe headline put a tough talk drives Clinton effort,

[00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:07.240]
National Security Stand scene adding to image of strength.

[00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:13.280]
One political scientist from Texas stated she's come off as a credible and serious on national defense.

[00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:16.780]
Initially two years ago most of us would have thought it would be a liability for her.

[00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:25.900]
The Globe noted that when Geraldine Ferraro was the Democratic candidate for Vice President 84, she was dodged by questions about whether she could push the button to launch an attack if the Cold War turned hot.

[00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:31.120]
The paper then quoted for her was saying that Clinton whom she supports from President has passed that test.

[00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:34.740]
You can't do that with Hillary Clinton. Hillary is in a totally different place, she said.

[00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:44.920]
Great, so forget the hope that a woman president might prove to be more enlightened than Macho Men in the matter of peacemaking and instead rest assured that Hillary would have the cajon's to push the button that would kill us all.

[00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:51.540]
Once again the old plutonium tactic of triangulation positioning oneself politically instead of taking a position of integrity.

[00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:52.840]
Nice go on Bobby Shere.

[00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:55.740]
A little bit too honest for the LA Times but a good guy.

[00:31:56.400 --> 00:32:01.460]
In the world of savings, there are junk bonds, municipal bonds and savings bonds.

[00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:05.400]
But how do you ensure that your bond purchase will outperform the others?

[00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:14.440]
And if you use Grossman and Harmon Bank in trust, we have the solution to ensure that your stock portfolio will grow excessively with our new Barry Bonds.

[00:32:14.660 --> 00:32:17.780]
I purchased my Barry Bonds and the investment paid off big time.

[00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:22.460]
The Barry Bonds performance was really enhanced and significantly outperform the others.

[00:32:22.460 --> 00:32:25.560]
But let it attack me with a baseball bat.

[00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:33.600]
Before you invest in our Barry Bonds, we'll inject you with ample knowledge to ensure your stock portfolio will be properly supplemented.

[00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:36.320]
My Barry Bonds performance has been outstanding.

[00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:44.260]
I'm really willing to look past the fact that I broke out with massive back acne because my stock portfolio keeps growing and growing.

[00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:52.220]
We're looking to enlarge your profit margin and thanks to Barry Bonds, your investment will be juiced off.

[00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:56.200]
Get your Barry Bonds today at Hughes, Grossman and Harmon Bank in trust.

[00:32:56.460 --> 00:33:00.340]
Look in the Wall Street Journal for our Nasdaq Stock Symbol HGH.

[00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:04.480]
It's 1047-13B4-115-60WQ.

[00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:08.760]
I'm going to ask one question and I asked this before to show a good point.

[00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:09.400]
Let's go on.

[00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:12.300]
With the Nasdaq 122.

[00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:19.880]
Anyway, how can Q&A have the audacity to be putting this on on the day we have a Dolphin Exhibitionist game on?

[00:33:20.580 --> 00:33:21.860]
I mean, I really think that is a very helpful one.

[00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:27.760]
The kickoff starts at 4 and Mad Dogs on in Kansas City at 2, so we have like basically a 6-hour pre-game show.

[00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:35.820]
But how can we put a non-sports show on the day when your Mime Dolphins are playing an exhibition against the Chiefs?

[00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:36.540]
Sounds criminal.

[00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:43.480]
I mean, what's more important, the kind of crap that I'm sitting here talking about or the question?

[00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:44.840]
Football crap.

[00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:48.060]
Well, for the Wednesday I probably would have put the game on a set of us.

[00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:51.540]
So that's right because they hate George like poison.

[00:33:53.900 --> 00:34:00.480]
Look at that Curtis was on yesterday and then they had the power hour with Curtis and Joe Zagaki was the power.

[00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:02.160]
And then they had Zagaki on, oh brother.

[00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:04.160]
So the Hopper is on vacation all week or what?

[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:06.120]
You guys look at his mind.

[00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:07.740]
I guess so, according to the schedule.

[00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:09.900]
So I guess he's not going to be on the pre-game show.

[00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:15.700]
The 600 and then of course across the street they got the Fony Maple Leaf pre-game show on the Fony Maple Leaf Sports Station.

[00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:19.900]
Whether Fony Maple Leaf personnel, he's like stew gotts, people like that.

[00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:24.000]
Former flunky producers who couldn't get arrested in the panty raid.

[00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:24.820]
Oh brother.

[00:34:26.700 --> 00:34:29.460]
732 votes on the pool for the godfather.

[00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:37.200]
And of course winning way ahead everybody else, nobody else could have done it beside Marlon Brando 268.

[00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:49.460]
I mean the thought, I mean Frank Sinatra's got 41 votes and the thought of him playing the godfather just so it's so idiotic, so inane, so pathetic, tragic, unacceptable, ridiculous and...

[00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:50.760]
Incribles.

[00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:51.220]
Back too.

[00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:53.720]
He's got 41 votes.

[00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:56.860]
In fact, he's in the third place behind Anthony Quinn and George C Scott.

[00:34:57.540 --> 00:34:58.260]
Frank Sinatra.

[00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:04.680]
So that's just a bunch of people out there trying to lay all that Mafia, all those rumors on his ass again.

[00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:07.420]
Because we know for sure that the Mafia was behind him.

[00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:10.880]
I mean, don't be knocking the Mafia baby.

[00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:12.020]
I like the Mafia.

[00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:14.100]
I only wish that I was on the inside.

[00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:14.580]
Yeah.

[00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:16.860]
I'd like to include if I was on the inside.

[00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:17.820]
I think they could only.

[00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:19.120]
Because I do love my can always.

[00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:19.940]
Oh god.

[00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:22.580]
And you don't want to think about the family.

[00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:23.840]
Right here, welcome.

[00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:25.020]
This is the family.

[00:35:25.180 --> 00:35:25.900]
A lot of buffers.

[00:35:27.140 --> 00:35:29.420]
The family and a lot of buffers.

[00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:30.780]
Don't quit suffering.

[00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:31.440]
Take buffering.

[00:35:33.780 --> 00:35:39.940]
Jack Lesenberry, on Smirking Chimpsons, the man who has the male, Al Gore understands what a radical neilist,

[00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:41.440]
nihilist, George W. Bush is.

[00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:45.580]
Here's the trouble with the way the media covers important new books.

[00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:50.320]
What matters most these days, especially in the broadcast world, is, well, not what really matters.

[00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:53.000]
They care mainly about some sexy tidbit.

[00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:57.600]
Talking heads race to give an advanced copy of the book, flip through it looking for a juicy part,

[00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:02.400]
or more likely as to publish his PR staff, throw the author on camera, ask him about the pages where he or she,

[00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:07.360]
sluck with, gave birth to, or bribed some personality, flipper, Clinton, Lindsey, the guy co-lizard,

[00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:09.380]
and on his force and weather.

[00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:14.780]
Print reviewers usually weave the least parts of the book, but they're under enormous time pressure to bang out a review,

[00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:17.420]
and often don't have enough time to reflect on any serious work.

[00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:19.520]
That's been the case for Eons.

[00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:24.080]
I always felt newspapers out of occasionally read about nonfiction books several months after they're published,

[00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:29.560]
and after gaining a little perspective, which brings me to the book everyone really ought to read in the waiting days of this summer.

[00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:34.860]
A book that's more profoundly important than I realized when it was first published, and I myself did a quick review of it, Jack says.

[00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:39.280]
That book is a sawed on reason by Al Gore, published at the start of this summer.

[00:36:39.620 --> 00:36:44.280]
Most reviews spent a lot of time asking, analyzing whether it was meant as a platform for another presidential bid.

[00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:45.520]
They were analyzing it.

[00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:55.460]
Today it seems pretty certain that the man who won the popular dervote seven years ago won't run for president, not this time, and most likely not ever again, which makes what he has to say even more valuable.

[00:36:56.180 --> 00:36:58.200]
I experienced this book in sort of a unique way.

[00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:03.160]
My historian wife and I spent a week driving across the prairies to visit the presidential libraries of Abraham Lincoln,

[00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:07.840]
Harry Truman and Dwight D. Asnow are partly to compare their leadership style to the present president.

[00:37:08.620 --> 00:37:09.900]
We did get some insights.

[00:37:10.340 --> 00:37:14.240]
Mostly, these great and near-grade presidents preferred reason to pig-headed faith.

[00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:17.040]
None was dogmatic, all were capable of listening to advice.

[00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:20.100]
They could often realize when they were wrong and learned from their mistakes.

[00:37:20.300 --> 00:37:22.760]
They were insured nothing like George W. Bush.

[00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:28.420]
On the way back, we began the talking book version of the assault on reason, and listened to it over nearly a thousand miles.

[00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:30.640]
The former vice president had our full attention.

[00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:34.760]
What stunned me was how far he was willing to go in telling the truth about this administration.

[00:37:35.740 --> 00:37:40.020]
Though he's a far better writer than most politicians, Gordon's not the world's greatest pro-stylus,

[00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:43.700]
he can occasionally be a repetition and a little too professorial.

[00:37:44.340 --> 00:37:46.700]
But he understands the system all right, he grew up in it.

[00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:49.640]
He was part of it. He was born to a politician, went on to become one himself.

[00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:51.960]
He is no virgin or no political saint.

[00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:56.560]
Yet for all these reasons, Gordon understands what a radical nihilist George W. Bush is.

[00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:59.660]
He knows this administration has worked hard to destroy what America ought to be.

[00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:04.660]
What is refreshing is his willingness to break the public's distance code of only going so far.

[00:38:05.060 --> 00:38:10.460]
Court demonstrates over and over again that we have a nightmare government whose leader has content for the concept of the public interest,

[00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:13.020]
we'll have content for our constitution if he understood it.

[00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:20.040]
This administration has turned the fundamental presumption of our democracy on its hand, he says, discussing its Stalinist wiretapping.

[00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:24.140]
Its assaults on our court democratic principles have left us less free and less secure.

[00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:30.140]
We're being doomed around the world by Bush's attitude of contemporary person, institutional nation, that disagrees with him,

[00:38:30.420 --> 00:38:36.480]
is exposed to Americans abroad and Americans in every U.S. town in city to a greater degree of attack because of his arrogance and willfulness.

[00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:40.320]
That's pretty damn candid for a politician, even a recovering one.

[00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:44.980]
The former vice president may at times annoy you as when he refuses to admit the occupant of the White House is stupid.

[00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:49.240]
He's plenty smart, Gordon says, and then presents a vast amount of information that contradicts this.

[00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:56.920]
I did find myself wishing the former vice president would discuss his own administration's failings a bit more to be sure Gordon didn't let us off the hook.

[00:38:57.340 --> 00:39:00.340]
He shows how the media help let things get where they are.

[00:39:00.900 --> 00:39:04.760]
But he does think there's something we can do about it and that the internet might be the key to our liberation.

[00:39:05.180 --> 00:39:13.420]
So read this book and think about it, then watch it so called one of these so-called presidential debates and reflect that the man who wrote this book is not running and these posturing clowns are.

[00:39:13.820 --> 00:39:16.360]
Let me know when you figure out what to do about that, Jack said.

[00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:17.660]
Let him know you can let him know.

[00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:22.240]
Let us all know when you figure out what to do about it, Jack. When you're the hero now, man.

[00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:24.380]
You're the hero. I'm just sound old.

[00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:24.760]
No, me?

[00:39:25.220 --> 00:39:27.820]
Yeah. All the mice-based people are like all over your looks.

[00:39:27.820 --> 00:39:28.100]
Oh, yeah.

[00:39:28.380 --> 00:39:32.440]
Oh, yeah. That's why you got that broken fibula, whatever you got.

[00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:33.560]
Tibula.

[00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:36.460]
I feel like a hero because the food just showed up.

[00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:38.640]
All right. Let's hear it.

[00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:39.020]
Oh, right.

[00:39:39.060 --> 00:39:41.160]
Food just showed up from Prime Blue Grill in the Miami.

[00:39:41.580 --> 00:39:43.680]
I don't think they brought anything for Christo. That's too bad.

[00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:44.960]
Oh, what if they-

[00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:45.180]
That's so-

[00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:46.760]
That'd be bad if they shine, Chris.

[00:39:47.580 --> 00:39:48.200]
Look at the white man.

[00:39:48.500 --> 00:39:51.340]
The 85 for me this morning on the scale, Mr. Not Too Bad, can say.

[00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:51.720]
Oh, yeah.

[00:39:51.740 --> 00:39:52.920]
The summertime I've already got-

[00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:55.400]
I got all this spirit eating time on my hands, but I'm not doing that.

[00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:55.500]
Good.

[00:39:55.700 --> 00:39:57.320]
Now that I'm injured, that's all I can do. I was eat.

[00:39:58.700 --> 00:40:01.100]
What a sad, what a lame excuse.

[00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:02.500]
Oh, that's bad.

[00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:04.320]
The 85 this morning. It's not too bad for me.

[00:40:04.780 --> 00:40:05.140]
Okay, good.

[00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:10.460]
If I could ever get to the 170s again, boy, I'd have a party in my pants and tell you right now, I would just go nuts.

[00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:12.200]
Don't invite me to that.

[00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:15.440]
I can't afford any more parties, okay?

[00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:16.140]
No.

[00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:22.000]
The last one was too expensive and too emotionally draining and debilitating for my little Mexican friend.

[00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:23.240]
Or was this the real brother?

[00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:25.620]
No more parties, baby. It's like throwing a wedding.

[00:40:26.620 --> 00:40:29.100]
Although I don't think he's going to be having any wedding.

[00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:31.420]
He's going to have a wedding like I'm going to have a wedding.

[00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:32.800]
Well, it's just one of those things, yeah.

[00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:35.380]
It's a little bit gay like that.

[00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:39.280]
Okay, let's take a look at this pool now and see if we can get to 800 by noon.

[00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:42.640]
If we can get data here by noon, then I'm pretty confident we got a thumbs-mox.

[00:40:42.780 --> 00:40:46.080]
In fact, I'd like to get to about 850 by noon just to be on the safe side.

[00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:46.780]
Do you know what I mean, Chris?

[00:40:48.460 --> 00:40:50.240]
Yeah, because if we...

[00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:52.060]
Yeah, I know. You're just upset you didn't get any food.

[00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:55.540]
Oh, he was actually getting up to go get some and you made him run back to the pool.

[00:40:55.540 --> 00:40:56.980]
No, they just brought on a whole bunch of stuff.

[00:40:57.780 --> 00:40:59.320]
Yeah, seeing. You're giving him crap.

[00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:00.400]
Like, he's not going to get...

[00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:01.460]
Why would they do that to him?

[00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:03.220]
I mean, I know Duff hates him like poison.

[00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:03.940]
Does he?

[00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:05.420]
Because he's unattractive.

[00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:07.580]
Yeah, that I was just going to say that because he's ugly.

[00:41:07.580 --> 00:41:08.140]
He's fanned nothing.

[00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:11.160]
Duff always like Josh Cordis a lot better.

[00:41:11.740 --> 00:41:12.480]
Yeah, we all did.

[00:41:12.900 --> 00:41:13.260]
Yeah.

[00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:14.040]
Did we really?

[00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:17.040]
Oh, brother.

[00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:18.780]
Wow, that stuff was way too good.

[00:41:18.780 --> 00:41:21.900]
Until I start when Chris starts ripping you and asks, when we get to the thousands of us today

[00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:24.820]
and he starts talking about how you can even get a thousand after the show yesterday,

[00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:27.120]
he's going to rip you up major ass.

[00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:28.100]
Then you're going to have to rip you up.

[00:41:28.100 --> 00:41:28.740]
I missed one thing.

[00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:30.240]
What's the trip with the Lymphsa?

[00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:32.520]
From God best.

[00:41:33.860 --> 00:41:34.660]
746 votes.

[00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:40.000]
If Marlon Brando hadn't played the Godfather or Don Corleone, which of these other actors

[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.660]
all of whom were considered for the role would you have preferred to play it?

[00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:45.180]
746 is the total number of votes we got.

[00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:47.340]
Nobody else could have done it 274.

[00:41:48.380 --> 00:41:49.180]
Almost 37%.

[00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:51.160]
Anthony Quinn, 199.

[00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:52.840]

[00:41:55.220 --> 00:41:55.300]
Right.

[00:41:56.080 --> 00:41:57.380]
Edward G. Robinson, 39.

[00:41:57.840 --> 00:42:00.460]
I mean, the Godfather couldn't be some skinny runt like Frank Sinatra.

[00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:05.120]
He had to be a big imposing factor, fat ass.

[00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:06.940]
Edward G. Robinson, 39.

[00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:07.800]

16.

[00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:15.400]
Are you talking while I'm reading the poll?

[00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:16.180]
Oh, yeah, yeah.

[00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:17.840]
To the food people know that.

[00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:19.320]
That's all crazy over here.

[00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:20.740]

[00:42:20.740 --> 00:42:22.640]
Carl W. Ponte, who was married to Sophia Lorraine.

[00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:23.680]
That's the only thing we know about him.

[00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:24.000]
9.

[00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:25.420]
This is the Neal Roger show.

[00:42:30.460 --> 00:42:31.180]
Any questions?

[00:42:32.060 --> 00:42:32.880]
Sparks for it.

[00:42:32.940 --> 00:42:34.520]

[00:42:39.660 --> 00:42:40.520]
Sparks for it.

[00:42:40.660 --> 00:42:41.880]
I like reading the sports section.

[00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:43.780]
I like reading the sports section too.

[00:42:44.060 --> 00:42:45.760]
Now the paper is better news in a computer.

[00:42:46.060 --> 00:42:47.340]
You can read the paper on a toilet.

[00:42:47.620 --> 00:42:51.100]
We had to like computers because what's it got to do with sports?

[00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:52.720]
Sparks for it.

[00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:53.100]

Sparks for it.

[00:42:56.560 --> 00:42:57.240]
Sparks for it.

[00:42:57.360 --> 00:42:57.360]

[00:42:57.380 --> 00:42:59.660]

[00:42:59.660 --> 00:43:00.920]
We got a girl in here.

[00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:01.400]
Yeah.

[00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:02.720]
A girl.

[00:43:03.060 --> 00:43:03.380]
Hello.

[00:43:03.780 --> 00:43:03.960]
See?

[00:43:04.260 --> 00:43:05.000]
We're straight.

[00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:06.240]
That's a girl.

[00:43:06.980 --> 00:43:07.980]
Girls are okay.

[00:43:08.300 --> 00:43:11.020]
But I'd rather stare blankly ahead and just talk about sports.

[00:43:11.860 --> 00:43:11.860]

[00:43:11.860 --> 00:43:12.520]
Sparks for it.

[00:43:12.580 --> 00:43:13.340]
Sparks for it.

[00:43:13.420 --> 00:43:14.260]

[00:43:22.660 --> 00:43:29.460]
I mean, like there just got to be somebody out there that just wants to hear about nothing

[00:43:29.460 --> 00:43:30.460]
but...

[00:44:23.140 --> 00:44:26.620]
Wait till you hear some of the couple of the brilliant emails I'm getting here this morning on my spot.

[00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:27.260]
I can't wait.

[00:44:27.580 --> 00:44:28.160]
Oh boy.

[00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:31.640]

[00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:32.320]

So we got two certificates to give away right now.

[00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:46.420]

[00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:48.580]

Of course, this being the sports stage we have to make excuses for Michael.

[00:51:08.900 --> 00:51:11.940]
And for everybody else all the criminals like in the history of the dogfighting organization,

[00:51:12.060 --> 00:51:14.560]
which I better not say that because the organization

[00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:19.420]

[00:51:39.740 --> 00:51:41.700]
Sounds like a real good atkins experience to me.

[00:51:43.180 --> 00:51:43.580]
Mmm.

[00:51:44.120 --> 00:51:47.960]
It's almost enough to make me get on a plane to go to Chicago this weekend and meet Robert.

[00:51:48.660 --> 00:51:50.580]
And his mom and his family.

[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:52.020]
And that's the bruise.

[00:51:52.220 --> 00:51:53.960]
And maybe we can get some bruises with Paul Servino.

[00:51:55.060 --> 00:51:57.020]
While he's auditioning for Godfather IV.

[00:51:59.340 --> 00:52:00.460]
765 votes on the pool.

[00:52:00.520 --> 00:52:02.120]
We're going to be way over 800 by noon.

[00:52:02.300 --> 00:52:05.020]
And anytime we get over 800 by noon, assuming there's anybody in town,

[00:52:05.380 --> 00:52:07.860]
we got a really heavy duty shot at 1,000 votes.

[00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:09.680]
And let me say it again.

[00:52:09.780 --> 00:52:13.860]
If we can get 1,000 votes on this pool, this will be, I don't know, I make a big deal out of it.

[00:52:13.920 --> 00:52:14.100]
Okay?

[00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:16.200]
But it just amazes me.

[00:52:16.360 --> 00:52:18.580]
And you want to know why I have to keep doing it because I work for Joe Bell.

[00:52:19.660 --> 00:52:22.720]
And because we follow, it could be the worst morning show in the history of radio.

[00:52:23.740 --> 00:52:25.600]
Remember the show when we had what's his name on?

[00:52:26.040 --> 00:52:26.940]
Ron Hershey Highway.

[00:52:28.560 --> 00:52:29.200]
I'm Carolyn.

[00:52:29.660 --> 00:52:29.840]
Yeah.

[00:52:30.220 --> 00:52:30.760]
And Jaldi.

[00:52:32.280 --> 00:52:33.140]
That's you always bad.

[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:35.260]
But at least it was camp.

[00:52:35.260 --> 00:52:38.020]
It was so bad that it was almost amusing.

[00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:39.100]
No, I mean right now.

[00:52:39.140 --> 00:52:39.280]
No.

[00:52:39.700 --> 00:52:39.780]
No.

[00:52:40.180 --> 00:52:41.140]
All my stuff almost.

[00:52:41.360 --> 00:52:41.500]
All right.

[00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:47.000]
But in retrospect, by comparison, that show was shown.

[00:52:47.200 --> 00:52:47.640]
It's shiny.

[00:52:47.860 --> 00:52:48.160]
It did.

[00:52:48.900 --> 00:52:50.160]
Compared to what we got now.

[00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:52.480]
You know what we got now?

[00:52:52.580 --> 00:52:53.340]
Well, not that much longer.

[00:52:53.340 --> 00:52:54.100]
I guess two more weeks.

[00:52:54.160 --> 00:52:55.220]
And then bye, bye, bye.

[00:52:56.500 --> 00:52:57.840]
Those guys are going to be toast.

[00:52:58.460 --> 00:53:00.320]
Although I'm sure, because what's his name?

[00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:01.080]
Ethan Schoelner-Krohl.

[00:53:01.340 --> 00:53:04.940]
First off, the bench is, who did you write with first off, the Kibble-Bokehampra, right?

[00:53:05.980 --> 00:53:08.380]
Because we got to have somebody on there who likes Jim Nagelmob.

[00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:10.980]
We'll talk about all those fairries diddling each other in the public t-rooms.

[00:53:12.120 --> 00:53:14.640]
Maybe Pope Kampra hangs out too much Ethan Skolniks.

[00:53:14.640 --> 00:53:18.280]
That's not a start hanging out at Westland and the t-room with JC Penny's.

[00:53:18.380 --> 00:53:19.540]
Then he'll see some real diddlin.

[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:21.940]
You wanna see the Limbo Rock, which rhymes with...

[00:53:22.780 --> 00:53:23.040]
Shock.

[00:53:25.360 --> 00:53:27.120]
169 votes on our award-winning pool.

[00:53:27.860 --> 00:53:29.920]
Now, are you all ready for the ball game?

[00:53:30.760 --> 00:53:31.280]
Oh, yeah.

[00:53:31.740 --> 00:53:33.440]
Is that going to be televised somewhere, I hope?

[00:53:33.440 --> 00:53:34.860]
Not yet is

[00:53:35.440 --> 00:53:38.220]
Well, I know that I mean like a somewhere

[00:53:39.420 --> 00:53:40.580]
National you have no idea

[00:53:41.580 --> 00:53:48.220]
Because I've only got like 6000 sports channels and boy. I got a great cable system here that the board even loves Neil Rogers

[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:27.240]
Sorn

[00:54:27.240 --> 00:54:27.620]
By the

[00:54:27.620 --> 00:54:28.240]
Jude

[00:54:33.440 --> 00:54:38.600]
And now your record will have an asteroid that it is

[00:54:40.440 --> 00:54:44.060]
We know you were injecting hormones into your teeth

[00:54:44.060 --> 00:54:48.420]
Do you know what that does to your Frankenstein?

[00:54:49.260 --> 00:54:52.820]
Very fun, it's got to go in on

[00:54:52.820 --> 00:54:56.680]
It's called our shrunk from two synchroids alone

[00:54:57.440 --> 00:55:00.800]
Very can't you see there are steroids in your teeth

[00:55:00.800 --> 00:55:06.040]
I know it might be wrong, but the record goes to battery barns

[00:55:06.520 --> 00:55:08.940]
Okay, let's see here I'm looking at some more of these emails

[00:55:08.940 --> 00:55:11.640]
I got a really big story here that you have met you missed yesterday

[00:55:11.640 --> 00:55:12.460]
ESPN

[00:55:13.100 --> 00:55:14.320]
Huh? ESPN what?

[00:55:14.560 --> 00:55:15.480]
Where you want the game tonight?

[00:55:15.540 --> 00:55:15.980]
Who cares?

[00:55:16.520 --> 00:55:21.920]
Joel says on your homepage on my space the original Godfather cover doesn't say part one

[00:55:22.840 --> 00:55:24.100]
Oh my God!

[00:55:25.240 --> 00:55:26.320]
What does that mean?

[00:55:27.720 --> 00:55:30.800]
Joel who doesn't have any photo by the way on his profile

[00:55:31.780 --> 00:55:34.160]
He's got 21 friends but he has no photo

[00:55:34.660 --> 00:55:38.140]
Come on guys, you got that again part one, it wasn't a part one, it was just the Godfather

[00:55:38.140 --> 00:55:41.400]
No, it was just the Godfather doesn't say there was no part one Joel

[00:55:44.160 --> 00:55:45.840]
And even better than that Robert

[00:55:46.840 --> 00:55:49.100]
He was a Robert who wants me to be his family

[00:55:49.800 --> 00:55:52.280]
Yeah I expect he said I say you that stuff to get you going

[00:55:52.280 --> 00:55:56.680]
I'm one of your longtime fans I was a guest on your show on 940

[00:55:57.280 --> 00:56:00.060]
Talking about credit repair when you did issues centuries ago

[00:56:00.060 --> 00:56:03.760]
Been listening ever since I live in Connecticut now but let's never chance I get on the internet

[00:56:04.620 --> 00:56:08.140]
He lives in Connecticut now so what's he doing in Chicago with this Steve Stone's mother?

[00:56:09.260 --> 00:56:13.340]
I've been known to you over the years as Ben Dover and others used to thank you every day

[00:56:13.340 --> 00:56:14.800]
No life, what do I get?

[00:56:15.520 --> 00:56:18.520]
Take care and don't ever die, who would I listen to? Rush Limbaugh question mark

[00:56:19.100 --> 00:56:22.740]
Bob of Pompo-no, that's who this is Bob for many of Pompo-no

[00:56:22.740 --> 00:56:25.520]
So you're at the Miracle Baseball game, still have a ball you autograph

[00:56:25.520 --> 00:56:28.720]
Hey Robert, I'm not going to autograph your ball anytime, trust me

[00:56:28.720 --> 00:56:29.820]
It sounds like you like that

[00:56:30.240 --> 00:56:33.040]
And Joel, get a life, it's not Godfather one

[00:56:33.840 --> 00:56:35.880]
You idiot, you jackass Joel

[00:56:35.880 --> 00:56:39.380]
You're a fairly silly person who can't even get a picture of yourself on him

[00:56:39.380 --> 00:56:41.740]
Well yeah maybe Robert's, or whatever Joel's ugly

[00:56:44.320 --> 00:56:47.160]
He ain't no for Raj, I'll tell you that, maybe he's just a Maraj

[00:56:48.120 --> 00:56:58.060]
Because I'm, people that don't have any photos, any proof of photo, I just generally, if they request to be added on there, just turn them down

[00:56:58.060 --> 00:56:59.280]
Bye bye, get lost

[00:57:01.340 --> 00:57:03.680]
7801 votes on there, Paul Serbino doesn't have any

[00:57:06.440 --> 00:57:08.720]
It's just these people, but well you know

[00:57:08.720 --> 00:57:12.560]
And I was going to take a whole bunch of calls today too, surprise, but then I took that one

[00:57:12.560 --> 00:57:13.880]
Hey, hey, birthday

[00:57:13.880 --> 00:57:16.080]
Uh-huh, that's all the calls

[00:57:16.620 --> 00:57:17.320]
WDQA and hello

[00:57:17.980 --> 00:57:21.400]
Uh-huh, there is again, that's it, that's all we got on the phone

[00:57:22.500 --> 00:57:28.040]
So those of you who say, well gee, it used to be when you take the calls, that's what we love hearing Niel and deal with the colors

[00:57:28.600 --> 00:57:30.400]
There are no colors, there are no colors

[00:57:30.400 --> 00:57:31.300]
They can, but

[00:57:32.100 --> 00:57:36.560]
Yeah, oh yeah, I might actually take a few here if the line's stirred percolate

[00:57:36.600 --> 00:57:42.380]
And I don't think they will though, because it's the 16th of August, anybody who absolutely doesn't have to be there is most definitely not

[00:57:44.780 --> 00:57:46.140]
Am I right about that?

[00:57:46.420 --> 00:57:46.500]
Yep

[00:57:47.780 --> 00:57:51.560]
We need to get over that 800 mark to make me feel really confident about the 1000

[00:57:51.560 --> 00:57:59.880]
Because according to uh-erics, extrapolations here we need 1.4 votes a minute, the rest of the show we got an hour and 39 minutes to get to 1000 today

[00:58:00.540 --> 00:58:04.940]
And if we can get to 1000 like I said on this horse ball, Paul, that will be quite an accomplishment

[00:58:04.940 --> 00:58:05.980]
WDQYM Hello

[00:58:06.940 --> 00:58:08.220]
Happy boy Hansen Hanging

[00:58:09.360 --> 00:58:10.200]
WDQYM Hello

[00:58:10.200 --> 00:58:11.760]
Hey, what about Jack O'Lemen?

[00:58:12.600 --> 00:58:13.340]
Yeah, what about-

[00:58:13.940 --> 00:58:14.820]
I'm about that people

[00:58:14.820 --> 00:58:16.220]
Yeah, how about this?

[00:58:17.660 --> 00:58:18.500]
WDQYM Hello

[00:58:18.500 --> 00:58:20.820]

WDQYM Ola

[00:58:30.460 --> 00:58:35.540]
Uh, yes, my father put a quarter into my rectum

[00:58:35.540 --> 00:58:37.700]
Yeah, Ann, you can change?

[00:58:38.120 --> 00:58:40.660]
And then, and then, mm-hmm

[00:58:40.660 --> 00:58:48.480]
The father, that's probably father or tool, stuck something in his rectum

[00:58:48.480 --> 00:58:49.820]
Found? No

[00:58:50.500 --> 00:58:51.340]
WDQYM Hello

[00:58:53.900 --> 00:58:54.800]
WDQYM Hello

[00:58:54.800 --> 00:58:58.740]
Well little did you know that Paul Lind was actually offered the role?

[00:58:59.720 --> 00:59:01.500]
Yeah, WDQYM Hello

[00:59:02.480 --> 00:59:03.060]
Hey buddy

[00:59:04.060 --> 00:59:05.680]
How about James Rodeon?

[00:59:06.380 --> 00:59:06.980]
Woohoo!

[00:59:09.740 --> 00:59:10.600]
WDQYM Hart

[00:59:11.240 --> 00:59:12.200]
What was it?

[00:59:12.620 --> 00:59:13.140]
It's simple

[00:59:13.140 --> 00:59:16.080]
Was him? Yeah, what do you mean him?

[00:59:16.080 --> 00:59:19.740]
It was WDQYM Hello

[00:59:20.900 --> 00:59:21.500]
Hello

[00:59:22.080 --> 00:59:22.620]
Yes?

[00:59:23.320 --> 00:59:25.020]
Neil? Yes

[00:59:25.660 --> 00:59:27.040]
Joe Mama, baby

[00:59:29.460 --> 00:59:30.320]
WDQYM Hello

[00:59:31.840 --> 00:59:34.080]
Hi Neil, I'm trying to get it on right now

[00:59:34.080 --> 00:59:36.520]
You mind saying the star-spangled banner on the radio?

[00:59:37.840 --> 00:59:38.740]
WDQYM Hello

[00:59:39.580 --> 00:59:41.900]
They were speaking in tongues!

[00:59:41.900 --> 00:59:42.120]
They were talking in tongues!

[00:59:43.580 --> 00:59:44.480]
WDQYM Hello

[00:59:45.200 --> 00:59:46.080]
WDQYM Hello

WDQDRDRDRDRDRDRDRDRDRDRDR Ukrainian

[00:59:58.820 --> 00:59:59.540]
WDQYM Hello

[01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:08.620]
WDQY M Tell Him

[01:00:08.620 --> 01:00:09.080]
WDQYM Hello

[01:00:10.300 --> 01:00:11.000]
WDQYM Hello

[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:11.640]
WDQYM Hello

[01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:11.640]

[01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:11.640]

[01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:11.640]

[01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:11.640]

[01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:11.660]
WDQYM Hello

[01:00:11.660 --> 01:00:11.880]
You had my coulnnor

[01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:12.740]
And here's the big news.

[01:00:12.920 --> 01:00:13.500]
Let me give you a hint.

[01:00:15.940 --> 01:00:19.900]
The poster children for Heart and Back added again for us.

[01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:28.320]
Thousands of Elvis Presley fans braved 105 degree heat as they wound down Grace Land's

[01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:33.440]
driveway in a grave sod procession yesterday and advanced some of the 30th anniversary

[01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:34.560]
of the singer's death.

[01:00:34.740 --> 01:00:38.000]
The heat led to the death of a fan from New Jersey, a 60-70-year-old woman.

[01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:39.240]
Wow.

[01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:40.280]
How do you like that?

[01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:40.840]
She died.

[01:00:42.700 --> 01:00:46.480]
Despite the promise of another furnace like they some fans began lining up early in the

[01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:50.400]
morning for the candlelight vigil, setting up umbrellas and folding chairs on the sidewalk

[01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:52.420]
along four lane Elvis Presley Boulevard.

[01:00:52.820 --> 01:00:56.180]
And you think that there are sane people in the world who think this is a sane planet

[01:00:56.180 --> 01:00:56.760]
to live on?

[01:00:57.080 --> 01:00:57.560]
Oh boy.

[01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:02.160]
The memorial was expected to run through the night into the day of the death anniversary.

[01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:04.540]
This is the anniversary of Elvis's death today.

[01:01:06.020 --> 01:01:06.960]
And you like that?

[01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:09.160]
I'm dying out of here.

[01:01:10.140 --> 01:01:15.720]
The procession with fans walking mostly single file and holding candles, filed up Grace

[01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:20.580]
Land's long winding driveway and past Presley's grave and a small garden beside the white

[01:01:20.580 --> 01:01:21.260]

[01:01:21.620 --> 01:01:25.660]
Many fans carried flowers, stuffed animals, and other small gifts to leave at the grave.

[01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:28.160]
Is that what you want to do?

[01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:29.860]
Is leave a flower in a gift at the grave?

[01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:31.960]
Well, there's a corpse that's been did for like 30 years.

[01:01:31.980 --> 01:01:33.180]
Yeah, leave a small gift, all right?

[01:01:33.580 --> 01:01:33.800]
Yeah.

[01:01:34.220 --> 01:01:34.960]
A small deposit.

[01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:40.240]
The body of the woman who died was found yesterday afternoon inside a trailer with a Grace

[01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:40.920]

[01:01:40.920 --> 01:01:44.620]
She had chronic health problems, but the Shelby County Medical Examiner's office had

[01:01:44.620 --> 01:01:45.840]
the heat contributed to her death.

[01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:49.600]
The Memphis Fire Department said it also treated at least six people overcome by heat, including

[01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:51.540]
an eight-year-old boy who was hospitalized.

[01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:55.180]
Now, what kind of eight-year-old kids know from my Elvis, right?

[01:01:55.860 --> 01:01:56.100]
Right.

[01:01:56.320 --> 01:01:57.160]
Kids who've been brainwashed.

[01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:58.840]
I'll listen to that.

[01:02:02.020 --> 01:02:02.840]
Right, right.

[01:02:03.100 --> 01:02:04.600]
They're gonna send my soul.

[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:06.260]
They're gonna send my soul.

[01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:07.340]
We're all fired.

[01:02:07.500 --> 01:02:08.380]
Let me tell you the channel.

[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:12.300]
Sounds like all this is screwed up.

[01:02:14.060 --> 01:02:15.440]
You can miss it.

[01:02:16.100 --> 01:02:17.140]
You ain't no Bob Lincoln.

[01:02:17.140 --> 01:02:18.020]
I'll send it at Bob.

[01:02:18.020 --> 01:02:21.360]
I could strip out of the house and sign it.

[01:02:21.540 --> 01:02:21.900]
Viva.

[01:02:22.420 --> 01:02:22.940]
Come on.

[01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:23.540]
You can do it now.

[01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:25.240]
It's fat cow.

[01:02:25.380 --> 01:02:25.740]
Viva.

[01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:28.640]
Well, I say yes, so we can't see that like Bob Lincoln.

[01:02:28.740 --> 01:02:28.820]
Remember?

[01:02:28.820 --> 01:02:28.820]

[01:02:28.820 --> 01:02:28.820]

[01:02:28.820 --> 01:02:28.820]

[01:02:28.820 --> 01:02:28.820]

[01:02:28.820 --> 01:02:28.820]

[01:02:28.820 --> 01:02:28.820]

[01:02:28.820 --> 01:02:28.820]

[01:02:28.820 --> 01:02:28.820]

[01:02:29.660 --> 01:02:30.200]
Of course.

[01:02:30.740 --> 01:02:30.960]
No.

[01:02:37.820 --> 01:02:42.620]

Mary Powell of Salinas Kansas said she took up her post at five o'clock in the morning to be sure

[01:02:57.600 --> 01:02:58.600]
to get near the front of the line.

[01:02:59.060 --> 01:03:02.300]
A lot of people would say I'm crazy, she said, but this has to do with my love for Elvis.

[01:03:02.620 --> 01:03:05.280]
He did so much for his fans, is what she said.

Are you alone?

[01:03:18.100 --> 01:03:19.640]
So tonight.

[01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:20.780]
Absolutely.

[01:03:21.580 --> 01:03:24.360]
Do you miss me tonight?

[01:03:24.940 --> 01:03:25.180]
No.

[01:03:25.540 --> 01:03:26.320]
Not in the least.

[01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:30.240]

To stand for a few moments in a misting tent tub, Kentucky Rain after when Elvis is songs.

[01:04:12.280 --> 01:04:14.580]
I bet I have that here on this, so maybe I don't.

[01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:16.140]
Kentucky Rain.

[01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:17.940]
Oh, I do have it, but not on this disc.

[01:04:19.860 --> 01:04:24.200]
Abbey Reaves of North Augustus South Carolina since the expected Memphis to be hot, but not this hot.

[01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:27.280]
We had some family here last year. They said it was only in the 90s, she said.

[01:04:27.700 --> 01:04:29.520]
It was about 600 degrees, it was like an oven.

[01:04:29.960 --> 01:04:34.200]
When Elvis Presley died, his finances were in sand shape, led by X-Wike Priscilla Presley,

Kurt Cobain according to Forbes Magazine.

[01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:55.080]
Dumb ass dirt!

[01:04:56.940 --> 01:04:58.720]
You've bought his records, you've seen his film.

[01:04:58.940 --> 01:05:01.700]
You've even purchased the day-glow velvet memorial paintings of the gas station.

[01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:04.940]
As a true Elvis fan, you think you've heard it all, but wait, there's more.

[01:05:05.300 --> 01:05:08.740]
Now you can buy secret recordings of Elvis's last telephone conversations.

[01:05:09.220 --> 01:05:11.580]
Yes, it's the Elvis tapes.

[01:05:11.580 --> 01:05:13.880]
Hello, baby. This is Elvis.

[01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:19.800]
I want you to come over right now and make me a big peanut butter and that'll stop us.

[01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:21.620]
A peanut butter and that'll stop us.

[01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:22.900]
We're really getting here through with the night.

[01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:26.140]
Yo, here else is in his most intimate moments.

[01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:27.240]
Hello, peace of mind, Peter.

[01:05:27.960 --> 01:05:28.600]
That was the Elvis.

[01:05:30.040 --> 01:05:32.580]
Once you bring me over, a couple large piles.

[01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:34.800]
Don't make a thing free.

[01:05:35.980 --> 01:05:37.200]
Don't make a sex, double cheese.

[01:05:38.420 --> 01:05:39.440]
Yeah, I'm hungry.

[01:05:40.580 --> 01:05:43.580]
I'm alone and I'm hungry.

[01:05:44.860 --> 01:05:49.240]
And you'll hear Elvis reveal how he really feels about the one true love of his life.

[01:05:49.340 --> 01:05:50.980]
Hold your back, hold your back, I'm a lot of pain.

[01:05:52.260 --> 01:05:53.180]
And I don't do way back.

[01:05:53.980 --> 01:05:55.500]
Would you pick up some donuts please?

[01:05:56.840 --> 01:05:58.740]
Lake jelly cream donuts.

[01:06:00.540 --> 01:06:02.080]
Crullest Jimmy's day is two.

[01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:05.240]
I love my baby honey, glows donuts.

[01:06:06.620 --> 01:06:08.180]
Without them I can't do.

[01:06:08.180 --> 01:06:10.100]
The Elvis taste.

[01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:12.060]
I'll give a give a give a give a give a give a more dolder.

[01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:14.500]
Available now. We've run stores everywhere.

[01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:15.120]
I love eat.

[01:06:15.620 --> 01:06:16.080]
I love eat.

[01:06:16.140 --> 01:06:17.880]
I live in the mountains of Orange and I live in the mountains.

[01:06:18.140 --> 01:06:19.020]
I get a big pot of smoke.

[01:06:19.380 --> 01:06:20.720]
A big cake.

[01:06:21.400 --> 01:06:21.660]
Golden.

[01:06:26.380 --> 01:06:27.920]
Let's all shed it's here for the king.

[01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:28.400]
Come on.

[01:06:28.620 --> 01:06:29.300]
You can do it.

[01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:31.000]
Are you shedin' it's here?

[01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:32.460]
Yeah, I'm shedin' something.

[01:06:32.860 --> 01:06:33.780]
Are you crying over here?

[01:06:33.900 --> 01:06:35.100]
I'm dying out of the shed.

[01:06:35.260 --> 01:06:36.160]
I'm lonely day.

[01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:38.520]
And a dozen times ago

[01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:42.300]
I reached out one night and we're gone.

[01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:45.400]
Don't know why you run.

[01:06:46.040 --> 01:06:47.100]
What you run to.

[01:06:47.580 --> 01:06:48.260]
On front.

[01:06:48.780 --> 01:06:49.780]
All I know.

[01:06:50.560 --> 01:06:51.540]
I want to.

[01:06:52.460 --> 01:06:53.620]
Where you are.

[01:06:54.780 --> 01:06:56.840]
Let me say one thing about this song, okay?

[01:06:57.520 --> 01:06:57.860]
It sucks.

[01:06:58.840 --> 01:06:59.480]
Pretty blue.

[01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:00.520]
Well look at the other song.

[01:07:00.660 --> 01:07:01.400]
That's pretty safe bet.

[01:07:01.940 --> 01:07:02.620]
Oh, that's bad.

[01:07:03.220 --> 01:07:04.780]
This respectful is what I would say.

[01:07:04.780 --> 01:07:07.000]
That's like Rippin' Danny Marino boy.

[01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:10.020]
How many hits did he have?

[01:07:11.740 --> 01:07:13.420]
I can't walk out.

[01:07:14.680 --> 01:07:15.340]
All right.

[01:07:16.180 --> 01:07:19.800]
Because I love you too much baby.

[01:07:20.260 --> 01:07:21.640]
Did he have belted out or what?

[01:07:21.740 --> 01:07:21.880]
No.

[01:07:22.360 --> 01:07:25.100]
As I get older I dislike him more intensely all the time.

[01:07:25.220 --> 01:07:25.980]
I don't know what that's all about.

[01:07:26.460 --> 01:07:27.040]
I think it's you.

[01:07:27.180 --> 01:07:28.080]
I think you brainwashed me.

[01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:28.520]
Uh-huh.

[01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:31.480]
I think you've weaned me off the king.

[01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:32.560]
This is not good.

[01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:35.020]
809 votes on the Paul Chris.

[01:07:35.860 --> 01:07:37.540]
We're going to do it.

[01:07:37.820 --> 01:07:38.580]
You're busy eating.

[01:07:38.720 --> 01:07:39.300]
I'm sure you're sure.

[01:07:39.300 --> 01:07:40.040]
I know what I'm doing.

[01:07:40.520 --> 01:07:42.060]
It's like you know something ought to be an inspiration.

[01:07:42.060 --> 01:07:43.440]
You think about fat Elvis.

[01:07:43.640 --> 01:07:45.920]
Not the slim Elvis, but the fat Elvis.

[01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:53.240]
The Elvis in Vegas you know that was wearing those white suits that were like those white outfits that were like four sizes too small.

[01:07:53.500 --> 01:07:53.980]
Never thought.

[01:07:54.200 --> 01:07:55.320]
With his big pupa can.

[01:07:55.500 --> 01:07:56.240]
I'll get out of here.

[01:07:56.360 --> 01:07:57.260]
You never saw that.

[01:07:58.140 --> 01:07:59.200]
George, do you believe that?

[01:07:59.860 --> 01:08:01.020]
I've seen a highlight of it.

[01:08:01.740 --> 01:08:03.060]
That's what I'm talking about.

[01:08:03.580 --> 01:08:05.160]
I'm not expecting to see the concert.

[01:08:05.340 --> 01:08:08.160]
I'm expecting that before you were born that you were in Vegas watching Elvis.

[01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:09.680]
Jackass.

[01:08:10.060 --> 01:08:12.320]
I'm talking about the clips you've seen on TV.

[01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:14.680]
Even little children have seen that crap.

[01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:16.180]
Even little babies have seen it.

[01:08:16.480 --> 01:08:17.120]
And I've only been.

[01:08:17.140 --> 01:08:19.140]
I guess I've seen like two minutes of it.

[01:08:19.560 --> 01:08:20.520]
Well, I was more than enough.

[01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:21.420]
I'm sure that was.

[01:08:21.420 --> 01:08:21.620]
Definitely was.

[01:08:21.720 --> 01:08:22.600]
Lustin' out all over.

[01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:23.840]
Fat as a cow.

[01:08:23.980 --> 01:08:24.500]
That should be it.

[01:08:24.500 --> 01:08:25.820]
And then of course it was dead you know.

[01:08:26.460 --> 01:08:27.520]
42 years old.

[01:08:27.660 --> 01:08:30.220]
Worth millions and millions and triggins and zillions.

[01:08:30.220 --> 01:08:32.320]
Everybody just slopped into his feet.

[01:08:33.320 --> 01:08:34.200]
And he was dead.

[01:08:34.440 --> 01:08:36.560]
By the way, the doll is down 182 points.

[01:08:36.740 --> 01:08:37.220]
Oh boy.

[01:08:37.460 --> 01:08:39.380]
Here comes the bunny and there goes your money.

[01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:42.520]
See, at least with the slots you have a little entertainment.

[01:08:42.700 --> 01:08:43.480]
There's the other story.

[01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:47.840]
Time to cherish a memory for those that are as little as you've cried.

[01:08:48.100 --> 01:08:48.760]
No time at all.

[01:08:48.780 --> 01:08:49.800]
Even more of knocks at the moment.

[01:08:49.820 --> 01:08:54.460]
I had no one here remembers where they were and what they were doing when they heard the news.

[01:08:54.540 --> 01:08:54.940]
No, I don't.

[01:08:54.960 --> 01:08:57.380]
It was at work at second ship.

[01:08:57.380 --> 01:08:59.200]
And I heard the news.

[01:09:00.160 --> 01:09:01.680]
And I have to worry.

[01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:03.120]
I was waiting for my boyfriend.

[01:09:03.320 --> 01:09:04.780]
I was all in my eyes out.

[01:09:05.140 --> 01:09:06.840]
I was playing baseball and I was on the computer.

[01:09:07.100 --> 01:09:07.100]

[01:09:07.380 --> 01:09:09.040]
I didn't believe it.

[01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:14.620]
With record breaking temperatures reaching 194 on the downside of the downside.

[01:09:15.060 --> 01:09:19.700]
This has been something of a dangerous ordeal for the elderly fans who've come to Graceland.

[01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:22.300]
But the true fans couldn't stay away.

[01:09:22.700 --> 01:09:24.760]
Not for this special anniversary.

[01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:26.640]
This music said, come along.

[01:09:27.020 --> 01:09:28.140]
We'll have fun.

[01:09:28.700 --> 01:09:30.060]
Jump on my bandwagon.

[01:09:30.180 --> 01:09:31.540]
We'll have a nice long ride.

[01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:33.400]
And that's what it was.

[01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:36.380]
A very nice, exciting ride.

[01:09:40.420 --> 01:09:41.940]
Right on this, we don't.

[01:09:42.440 --> 01:09:43.760]
Oh my God.

[01:09:44.380 --> 01:09:45.400]
I have no life.

[01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:51.000]
I can't hear my heart see.

[01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:52.460]
He sure was no Don Holes.

[01:09:52.460 --> 01:09:54.660]
Oh, there it is.

[01:09:54.780 --> 01:09:55.580]
There's that white outfit.

[01:09:56.580 --> 01:09:59.800]
The one I was 16, size is just small.

[01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:03.140]
His puppet was like pushing the sequence off him.

[01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:10.720]
Oh, I...

[01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:12.400]
Oh, I...

[01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:18.780]
Now let me ask you, is there any song that he did that you, anyone that you actually might have, might admit to liking a little bit?

[01:10:21.720 --> 01:10:22.160]
Um...

[01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:24.820]
I'm thinking about it.

[01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:25.800]
I'm giving it a...

[01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:27.680]
I got a mole here.

[01:10:28.060 --> 01:10:28.480]
I got a mole here.

[01:10:28.980 --> 01:10:31.720]
How about, won't you wear my finger around your neck?

[01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:32.260]
No.

[01:10:32.860 --> 01:10:33.620]
You don't like that?

[01:10:33.720 --> 01:10:34.560]
I kind of like that one.

[01:10:34.700 --> 01:10:35.440]
I was not on this.

[01:10:35.580 --> 01:10:36.560]
I have it somewhere here.

[01:10:36.820 --> 01:10:37.140]
It is.

[01:10:37.460 --> 01:10:37.460]

[01:10:37.460 --> 01:10:37.460]

[01:10:37.460 --> 01:10:39.000]
It's a hippie sort of way.

[01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:40.180]
Won't you wear my...

[01:10:40.180 --> 01:10:40.740]
It's a...

[01:10:40.740 --> 01:10:43.580]
It's a hippie sort of way.

[01:10:44.360 --> 01:10:44.580]
Yes?

[01:10:44.940 --> 01:10:45.620]
Jailhouse Rock.

[01:10:46.140 --> 01:10:48.060]
Oh no, that's not on this disc.

[01:10:48.060 --> 01:10:49.520]
Now these three discs.

[01:10:49.660 --> 01:10:50.640]
It's on, I got it somewhere.

[01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:52.300]
I got it somewhere.

[01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:52.980]
Oh, you got it.

[01:10:53.060 --> 01:10:53.620]
Thank God, ready?

[01:10:54.360 --> 01:10:54.940]
It's my favorite.

[01:10:55.320 --> 01:10:55.380]
It's my favorite.

[01:10:55.380 --> 01:10:56.080]
George and Elvis.

[01:10:56.200 --> 01:10:56.580]
Daddy.

[01:10:57.240 --> 01:10:59.060]
Born through a party in the Catholic Jailhouse.

[01:11:00.020 --> 01:11:01.680]
Well, the band was there, they were there.

[01:11:01.980 --> 01:11:02.640]
It was okay.

[01:11:02.920 --> 01:11:03.860]
It was okay.

[01:11:03.980 --> 01:11:04.840]
Yeah, it's cute.

[01:11:05.180 --> 01:11:06.420]
How about Gentile on my mind?

[01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:07.500]
No.

[01:11:09.220 --> 01:11:10.500]
Gentile on my mind.

[01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:13.000]
Too many glam, baby.

[01:11:13.580 --> 01:11:14.120]
That's what's up.

[01:11:14.460 --> 01:11:14.600]
Oops.

[01:11:14.920 --> 01:11:15.420]
Sorry, oh.

[01:11:19.340 --> 01:11:21.520]
I've actually been gambled like to a shot him for this.

[01:11:21.520 --> 01:11:22.720]
Didn't have been gambled record this?

[01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:24.060]
Yeah, I don't know.

[01:11:24.060 --> 01:11:24.560]
Come on.

[01:11:25.380 --> 01:11:26.940]
I mean, not that we like to gambled.

[01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:28.300]
We're delighted with the process.

[01:11:29.800 --> 01:11:31.420]
Oh, this is horrendous.

[01:11:32.180 --> 01:11:33.200]
It's brutal, it's awful.

[01:11:34.520 --> 01:11:36.340]
It's annoying, I'm not sure.

[01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:38.520]
Oh my God, you ought to be, though.

[01:11:39.520 --> 01:11:40.140]
Here you go.

[01:11:40.220 --> 01:11:41.220]
Nobody don't like this.

[01:11:42.820 --> 01:11:44.080]
I don't even like it.

[01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:46.220]
It's cute, no one can ever.

[01:11:47.200 --> 01:11:48.080]
It's cute.

[01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:49.160]
What?

[01:11:50.860 --> 01:11:54.200]
It's cute and also, also in the realm of cute.

[01:11:55.020 --> 01:11:57.640]
Not good, but can't be, wait, where's it?

[01:11:58.180 --> 01:11:58.700]
I'm already played.

[01:12:00.100 --> 01:12:01.420]
I already played all the sugarcub.

[01:12:01.540 --> 01:12:04.540]
This richard quest with those idiots, perfect match, by the way.

[01:12:04.540 --> 01:12:05.700]
This guy looks a little like hell.

[01:12:06.760 --> 01:12:09.780]
It is not trying to be Elvis morning, noon, and night.

[01:12:09.780 --> 01:12:11.980]
Then who's competing in the competition?

[01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:15.920]
Is there anybody who's ever been on television more disgusting than Richard Quest?

[01:12:16.140 --> 01:12:17.440]
I mean, I've not just seen that.

[01:12:17.680 --> 01:12:17.780]
Nancy Grace.

[01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:18.720]
Nancy Grace.

[01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:19.480]
Huh?

[01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:20.080]
Nancy Grace.

[01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:21.640]
Not even close, are you?

[01:12:21.780 --> 01:12:22.720]
Not even close.

[01:12:22.920 --> 01:12:24.380]
I'll take two of him before I'll take one of her.

[01:12:24.540 --> 01:12:25.600]
Not even close, Fran.

[01:12:26.660 --> 01:12:27.040]

[01:12:27.580 --> 01:12:28.840]

[01:12:34.620 --> 01:12:35.880]
I'm trying to land the fire here.

[01:12:36.240 --> 01:12:37.340]
The king is back.

[01:12:37.340 --> 01:12:38.940]
Bigger and better than ever.

[01:12:39.220 --> 01:12:42.260]
Elvis Presley in his first big movie role since he's been dead.

[01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:43.920]
Elvis, of Arabia.

[01:12:46.620 --> 01:12:47.660]
Elvis Presley.

[01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:53.340]
Yes, it's a completely new Elvis movie with the same old Elvis movie touches.

[01:12:53.880 --> 01:12:58.980]
17 unforgettable waves and 18 more get-a-ho songs, including dead bear.

[01:12:59.420 --> 01:13:00.100]
Don't be cool.

[01:13:00.520 --> 01:13:01.360]
Dying in the chapel.

[01:13:01.780 --> 01:13:03.000]
Blue swayed burial shoes.

[01:13:03.460 --> 01:13:04.660]
You ain't got the put-up hall there.

[01:13:05.140 --> 01:13:05.500]
And more.

[01:13:05.500 --> 01:13:08.560]
Yes, see Elvis in his stethis performance yet.

[01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:11.020]
He's bigger, better, and better than ever.

[01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:12.520]
Elvis, of Arabia.

[01:13:13.020 --> 01:13:15.300]
Playing at a theater, drive that remote-shrievery near you.

[01:13:15.580 --> 01:13:15.800]
Blue.

[01:13:16.440 --> 01:13:17.000]
Liger.

[01:13:17.320 --> 01:13:18.200]
Liger, you're gonna have to go this.

[01:13:22.160 --> 01:13:24.760]
Remember this golden gasser.

[01:13:31.540 --> 01:13:32.660]
Wonderful WQAM.

It's not me.

[01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:49.180]
It's not me.

[01:13:49.580 --> 01:13:50.660]

I'll say that.

[01:13:55.860 --> 01:13:57.040]
We hit him with two fire shots.

[01:13:57.400 --> 01:13:57.780]
I'm a good friend.

[01:13:58.520 --> 01:13:59.900]

real news oh God's warriors God's Jewish warriors God's Muslim warriors God's

[01:18:19.820 --> 01:18:22.580]
Christian warriors I'm not saying anything about God's atheist warriors on

[01:18:22.580 --> 01:18:27.500]
there huh huh Frank Badosky I'm smoking chimp rights if I can get back to this

[01:18:27.500 --> 01:18:33.600]
unless you want to hear a lot more Elvis I mean you know whatever you like I'm

[01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:40.340]
here to please I remember as a child I never heard of that I didn't hear of

[01:18:40.340 --> 01:18:53.860]
this though the maple syrup is dripping down my chin that's right it's

[01:18:53.860 --> 01:18:55.100]
maple syrup don't get smart

[01:18:55.700 --> 01:18:56.100]
holy

[01:19:00.180 --> 01:19:03.080]
hey you gonna say something like sunny hursin

[01:19:03.080 --> 01:19:16.540]
oh boy wow design America baby it's a sad sad world even in Japan they do the

[01:19:16.540 --> 01:19:21.140]
same thing with the Elvis impersonators you know even those little silly Japanese

[01:19:21.140 --> 01:19:25.760]
He doesn't think they got anybody telling them over that they're doing first night Elvis. They do know I hear

[01:19:26.380 --> 01:19:27.460]
Call and fat

[01:19:28.120 --> 01:19:31.820]
Oh, yeah, probably cuz we're exporting all that American food all I don't break over there in Japan

[01:19:33.240 --> 01:19:36.960]
839 votes on the pool Carl O'Ponte finally got another one out of sympathy

[01:19:36.960 --> 01:19:37.640]
I guess he's got

[01:19:37.640 --> 01:19:40.260]
Solamente D.A. He's got last place with 10

[01:19:41.820 --> 01:19:45.180]
839 I think that thousand is almost a given but don't ever say it is now

[01:19:45.180 --> 01:19:47.860]
What do we need to get to a thousand according to Eric's chart there?

[01:19:49.020 --> 01:19:54.100]
Take a puke at it 1.3 see it was 1.4 minute now it's down to 1.3

[01:19:54.100 --> 01:20:00.260]
Mega progress we're making some very serial progress if we can get that down to like a one-man or even less

[01:20:00.860 --> 01:20:05.860]
Then even Chris is gonna say wow I think he got a made fat. So I think that's what you're gonna say. Yeah, something like that

[01:20:06.760 --> 01:20:12.440]
Right, but ask he says Democrats need to call Robe the Bush Robe vision is so during its breathtaking he writes

[01:20:12.920 --> 01:20:17.420]
George Bush and Carl Robe seek one party domination of American politics with executive domination over the

[01:20:17.420 --> 01:20:22.760]
Legislative and judicial branches of American government they moved to practice a Supreme Court with unitary power believers

[01:20:22.760 --> 01:20:28.300]
But the Congress and a submissively accepting executive branch encroachments destroy the system of checks and balances and impose

[01:20:28.300 --> 01:20:32.760]
Radical changes in the American government that are the antithesis of what the founding fathers intended

[01:20:33.660 --> 01:20:40.740]
They seek to change the very psychology of Americanism pounding fear of the American people the courts Congress and Democratic leaders since 9-11

[01:20:41.840 --> 01:20:45.460]
Posing the choices to make the big brother or being exterminated by mushroom clouds

[01:20:45.460 --> 01:20:52.620]
They've pummeled the Republic for six years with an on-stop 24-7 propaganda campaign a fear monitoring that is unprecedented in the American history

[01:20:52.620 --> 01:20:53.980]
It is unprecedented

[01:20:54.920 --> 01:21:01.320]
George Bush is a lame duck with an iron will Bush and negated the 2006 election by pushing to an escalation of the Iraq war

[01:21:01.320 --> 01:21:05.460]
Expanded executive powers over Congress and new powers for foreign and domestic surveillance

[01:21:06.660 --> 01:21:12.060]
Congressional Republicans were reduced to sick-of-fantastic supporters while they groused in the cloakrooms that Bush could destroy their party

[01:21:12.660 --> 01:21:19.320]
Prior to memorial they recess congressional Democrats offered unconditional surrender on the back escalation and just people the August recess

[01:21:19.320 --> 01:21:21.480]
They followed with unconditional surrender on eavesdropping

[01:21:22.780 --> 01:21:27.840]
Bush and Robe are conviction politicians with an iron will to turn their convictions into policy and power

[01:21:27.840 --> 01:21:33.480]
They're fearless when pursuing their program even in the face of the American Constitution federal law and national elections

[01:21:33.480 --> 01:21:40.380]
By contrast Democratic leaders from out of themselves with cover a's of consultants pollsters and career operatives who are not

[01:21:40.920 --> 01:21:45.180]
Conviction politicians that are tactical maneuvers without any core of substance or steel

[01:21:45.180 --> 01:21:52.700]
You like the way I'm reading this so far too far the Democrats leading presidential campaign strategist lost every presidential campaign from

[01:21:52.700 --> 01:21:59.300]
1972 until 2004 is advised a long list of major Democrats to send troops to die in Iraq for reasons of political calculation

[01:22:00.180 --> 01:22:04.520]
If national Democrats disclose the private vice of their consultants and operatives over the last five years

[01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:07.740]
Who would be more embarrassed those who offered this advice or those who followed it?

[01:22:08.340 --> 01:22:12.160]
Even today it's the breed of Democrats who advised leaders to support the Iraq war in 2002

[01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:14.880]
Who advised them to support the escalation in 2008?

[01:22:15.660 --> 01:22:22.200]
Democrats lost in 2000 2002 and 2004 they finally won in 2006 and immediately began surrendering their authority

[01:22:22.200 --> 01:22:28.580]
Unable to resist one of the most unpopular presidents in history with the predictable result of the Democratic Congress is one of the most unpopular in history

[01:22:29.640 --> 01:22:34.900]
Democrats need to crawl roll someone who can outline a grand vision and pursue it with the toughness to nasty courage

[01:22:34.900 --> 01:22:38.660]
Fearlessness and will that will the win that wrote possesses

[01:22:38.660 --> 01:22:45.120]
Democrats need what Americans want a conviction politics that is principled fearless intonations and predicts confidence and strength of

[01:22:45.120 --> 01:22:48.620]
Otters hungry for change the vision is clear a

[01:22:48.620 --> 01:22:53.580]
Realigning election in 2000 made with the Democratic president and Democratic Congress to establish one of those great areas of

[01:22:53.580 --> 01:22:57.280]
American optimism and reform Democrats could run a national morning and American TV

[01:22:57.280 --> 01:23:04.940]
Add that attacks the bush failures and abuses the Republican obstructionism that blockades change and offers an uplifting panorama of the America that will be with change

[01:23:04.940 --> 01:23:05.560]
however

[01:23:06.260 --> 01:23:11.400]
Leaders lead and the battle must be waved on the floor Congress with coercion tenacity that is lacking today

[01:23:11.400 --> 01:23:14.620]
Democrats can defeat the politics of fear and inspiration of bravery

[01:23:14.620 --> 01:23:20.380]
But only if they demonstrate bravery themselves and challenge Americans to be bigger and more noble than the darker impulses of the Bush and

[01:23:20.520 --> 01:23:24.720]
Rivera a Democratic role would know that it's not enough to oppose the falsehoods

[01:23:24.720 --> 01:23:31.480]
It's now imperative to trust the people with the truth for Democrats no more surrenders no more fear no more retreats no more maneuvers

[01:23:32.120 --> 01:23:37.440]
Democrats represent a majority to come through with the majority in Congress if they fight with the focus and determination of Bush and

[01:23:37.440 --> 01:23:39.800]
Roleville win a victory worthy of Kennedy Roosevelt

[01:23:40.920 --> 01:23:43.900]
Inhale now and hold your breath. Well, I should know what XA

[01:23:43.900 --> 01:23:47.380]
Am I holding my breath? No

[01:23:51.060 --> 01:23:54.080]
841 and it's just coming up on noon Chris

[01:23:54.900 --> 01:23:55.340]
Yes

[01:23:56.120 --> 01:24:00.760]
Just mentioned that in passing. Okay, 841. I mean, you know

[01:24:00.760 --> 01:24:05.140]
Didn't you tell me before the George failed to get a thousand and started the poll a week at a time now?

[01:24:05.300 --> 01:24:05.540]
You said

[01:24:06.180 --> 01:24:12.960]
We're thinking about major ass and by the way Joel Joel sent me six thousand and more emails after and he said something about

[01:24:12.960 --> 01:24:18.080]
This is birthday today looking congratulations on your birthday Joe because on on your birthday as a gift for me

[01:24:18.080 --> 01:24:19.360]
I've blocked you from my my space

[01:24:20.720 --> 01:24:26.600]
Right, that's your birthday gift a block thing on my space because you're an idiot and you're bugging the hell out of me and go away

[01:24:26.600 --> 01:24:32.260]
You're more on you. Joel. I have no luck. That's you. I like to relax by having very magnetized my balls

[01:24:32.260 --> 01:24:34.180]
I'm listening to the new rod is 12 to one hour

[01:24:43.540 --> 01:24:44.240]
Don't lie

[01:24:45.860 --> 01:24:46.220]
Oh

[01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:53.520]
I形

[01:26:05.520 --> 01:26:12.140]
I'm a big B

[01:26:12.140 --> 01:26:14.580]
And I'm a big B

[01:26:14.580 --> 01:26:15.720]
I'm a big B

[01:26:15.720 --> 01:26:15.720]

[01:26:15.720 --> 01:26:15.720]

[01:26:15.720 --> 01:26:15.720]

[01:26:15.720 --> 01:26:15.720]

[01:26:15.720 --> 01:26:15.720]

[01:26:15.720 --> 01:26:15.860]
I'm a big B

[01:26:15.860 --> 01:26:15.860]

[01:26:15.860 --> 01:26:15.860]

[01:26:15.860 --> 01:26:15.860]

[01:26:15.860 --> 01:26:17.180]
I'm a big B

[01:26:17.180 --> 01:26:18.120]
I'm a big B

[01:26:19.180 --> 01:26:19.960]
I'm a big B

[01:26:21.340 --> 01:26:22.220]
I'm a big B

[01:26:24.140 --> 01:26:25.100]
I'm a big B

[01:26:25.100 --> 01:26:28.380]
What you got to do is, there's nothing else that I like about a little more than me

[01:26:28.380 --> 01:26:29.700]
I'm a big B

[01:26:29.700 --> 01:26:34.420]
This is my favorite part of the Thursday shows

[01:26:34.420 --> 01:26:35.740]
Is this new thing, you know

[01:26:35.740 --> 01:26:37.380]
We have 24 left

[01:26:37.380 --> 01:26:38.880]
We saw a little more than half

[01:26:40.740 --> 01:26:41.200]
Okay

[01:26:43.040 --> 01:26:44.300]
You want me to say it again

[01:26:45.100 --> 01:26:45.680]
Twenty-two

[01:26:45.680 --> 01:26:47.240]
Ever asked me about my business

[01:26:48.720 --> 01:26:51.060]
22 left certificates for Prime Blue Grill

[01:26:51.060 --> 01:26:53.020]
Which you're raving about the great steaks

[01:26:53.020 --> 01:26:54.840]
Oh yeah, and all the other good stuff

[01:26:54.840 --> 01:26:56.020]
And the place is just beautiful

[01:26:56.620 --> 01:26:58.880]
At 315 South Viscayne Boulevard in Miami

[01:27:00.580 --> 01:27:01.420]
22 left

[01:27:03.060 --> 01:27:04.900]
I'm trying to break your record from last week

[01:27:04.900 --> 01:27:06.320]
I don't think I'm going to do it

[01:27:06.320 --> 01:27:07.080]
You never know

[01:27:07.820 --> 01:27:08.780]
Not going to happen

[01:27:10.780 --> 01:27:12.300]
Keep hitting it and clicking it

[01:27:12.350 --> 01:27:14.210]
And banging it and refreshing it

[01:27:14.610 --> 01:27:15.410]
And pushing it

[01:27:16.050 --> 01:27:16.450]
21

[01:27:18.010 --> 01:27:20.550]
And I had that same problem again that I had a couple weeks ago

[01:27:20.550 --> 01:27:22.290]
I don't think last week I had it

[01:27:23.030 --> 01:27:23.830]
Because you weren't here

[01:27:24.350 --> 01:27:25.490]
Huh? Because you weren't here

[01:27:25.970 --> 01:27:27.390]
When you go to WQM.com

[01:27:27.390 --> 01:27:30.270]
That's right, I wouldn't know but I'm just talking about during the show

[01:27:30.270 --> 01:27:31.410]
I think no, I wasn't there

[01:27:31.410 --> 01:27:33.170]
Any other time I click on that thing

[01:27:33.170 --> 01:27:35.430]
on QM.com under my picture

[01:27:35.430 --> 01:27:36.870]
Or it says Neil's deals

[01:27:36.870 --> 01:27:39.710]
It pops up okay but today it won't come up

[01:27:39.710 --> 01:27:40.970]
And you have to go to the right hand column

[01:27:40.970 --> 01:27:42.470]
And go about halfway down

[01:27:42.470 --> 01:27:44.110]
And there's another thing for the Neil's deals

[01:27:44.110 --> 01:27:45.710]
And that comes up just fine

[01:27:45.710 --> 01:27:46.910]
Just fine

[01:27:47.890 --> 01:27:49.570]
20, we got 20 left out of 50

[01:27:49.570 --> 01:27:50.630]
Well that's a good start

[01:27:50.630 --> 01:27:52.390]
We're not going to break George's record

[01:27:52.390 --> 01:27:54.070]
But then again, who the hell could you know

[01:27:54.070 --> 01:27:56.150]
See George concentrates on the important things

[01:27:56.150 --> 01:27:57.870]
Not stupid stuff like pull numbers

[01:27:57.870 --> 01:27:59.270]
You know like 1000 votes on a pull

[01:27:59.270 --> 01:28:01.650]
Who cares about some silly childish stuff like that

[01:28:01.650 --> 01:28:02.450]
But you know something

[01:28:02.450 --> 01:28:04.610]
Sometimes I can be pretty silly and pretty childish

[01:28:04.610 --> 01:28:05.350]
Well that's good

[01:28:05.350 --> 01:28:06.970]
That's right, it's not all bad

[01:28:06.970 --> 01:28:09.530]
As Bubba would say it's all good

[01:28:10.770 --> 01:28:13.050]
Trust me, I disagree with that

[01:28:13.050 --> 01:28:13.750]
It's not all good

[01:28:13.750 --> 01:28:16.270]
Most of it's good but some of it's bad

[01:28:19.410 --> 01:28:21.610]
I say that from personal experience

[01:28:21.610 --> 01:28:24.450]
Most of it's pretty good but some of it's bad

[01:28:26.010 --> 01:28:27.630]
Still stuck on 20 now

[01:28:27.630 --> 01:28:29.910]
You could play stuck on you by all the cell

[01:28:29.910 --> 01:28:30.230]
It'd be good

[01:28:30.230 --> 01:28:31.970]
I think that's a bad mistake I made

[01:28:31.970 --> 01:28:33.730]
Doing all that Elvis die I agree

[01:28:33.730 --> 01:28:35.230]
You agree with what?

[01:28:35.370 --> 01:28:36.390]
That it was a bad mistake

[01:28:36.890 --> 01:28:38.670]
That only dead people are into Elvis

[01:28:38.670 --> 01:28:40.390]
Or people that should be

[01:28:40.390 --> 01:28:42.330]
Or people...

[01:28:42.810 --> 01:28:43.790]
I have no life

[01:28:43.790 --> 01:28:45.050]
Like that

[01:28:48.570 --> 01:28:50.210]
He could really accrue into

[01:28:50.210 --> 01:28:51.990]
You know I said Krone

[01:28:51.990 --> 01:28:53.610]
And you know what, Bocaper is going to say tomorrow

[01:28:54.130 --> 01:28:55.610]
We heard him say it again

[01:28:55.610 --> 01:28:57.830]
Come down here and see that to our face

[01:28:59.230 --> 01:29:00.030]
199 points

[01:29:00.030 --> 01:29:01.810]
Look at that in a second that that was going to go

[01:29:01.810 --> 01:29:03.690]
Top the 200 mark on the downside

[01:29:05.630 --> 01:29:06.990]
Not that I want you people to

[01:29:06.990 --> 01:29:08.950]
You know, dumb enough to have your money in the market

[01:29:09.910 --> 01:29:11.710]
Look at that minus 200 point

[01:29:11.710 --> 01:29:13.430]
Minus 203

[01:29:13.430 --> 01:29:13.750]
Woo!

[01:29:14.850 --> 01:29:15.250]
Wow

[01:29:16.910 --> 01:29:18.370]
We're stuck at the 20 left

[01:29:18.370 --> 01:29:21.130]
I don't understand that because the first 30 went like hotcakes

[01:29:21.130 --> 01:29:21.790]
The first 30

[01:29:21.790 --> 01:29:22.910]
Lot 30 man

[01:29:22.910 --> 01:29:25.450]
And now we're stuck at 20 maybe that's all we got

[01:29:25.450 --> 01:29:26.530]
It's for his listeners you know

[01:29:27.190 --> 01:29:29.050]
I think you're right the Elvis thing

[01:29:29.050 --> 01:29:30.570]
Just through a monkey wrench

[01:29:30.570 --> 01:29:33.210]
Or maybe there's something screwed up with this thing

[01:29:34.650 --> 01:29:36.250]
You think that's possible

[01:29:37.890 --> 01:29:38.330]
Maybe

[01:29:38.910 --> 01:29:40.370]
I want to wind up like Stu Gus

[01:29:40.370 --> 01:29:43.970]
And that's certificates for restaurants that we were pumping like four or five weeks ago

[01:29:43.970 --> 01:29:45.310]
We don't want to be like that

[01:29:45.310 --> 01:29:46.310]
That won't happen

[01:29:46.910 --> 01:29:48.310]
What? That won't happen

[01:29:49.350 --> 01:29:50.390]
How do you know that

[01:29:50.850 --> 01:29:52.510]
We're not making any progress man

[01:29:52.510 --> 01:29:53.810]
It's still stuck there on 20

[01:29:54.390 --> 01:29:57.370]
2020, 2020 even Boba Waller is a stuck on 2020 baby

[01:29:57.370 --> 01:29:59.050]
Or she says 2020

[01:29:59.690 --> 01:30:01.570]
She's another bitch that don't belong on the air

[01:30:01.570 --> 01:30:02.630]
With a speech defect

[01:30:02.630 --> 01:30:05.230]
Her enriched request and Tom Bokah

[01:30:06.450 --> 01:30:10.010]
Do you have any idea what a big improvement Brian Williams is over Tom Bokah

[01:30:10.010 --> 01:30:11.050]
Another we used to his marketing

[01:30:11.050 --> 01:30:13.150]
Yeah there's something wrong with this thing

[01:30:13.150 --> 01:30:13.810]
I think it's all

[01:30:13.810 --> 01:30:15.570]
All shook up or all gender

[01:30:15.570 --> 01:30:16.410]
On Gapatchki

[01:30:17.450 --> 01:30:18.450]
That could be it too

[01:30:21.330 --> 01:30:23.650]
Well I'm like I'm not going to waste my time looking at that thing

[01:30:23.650 --> 01:30:25.350]
We'll do it you know like in five minutes

[01:30:26.150 --> 01:30:26.510]
Right?

[01:30:27.050 --> 01:30:28.830]
Risk can keep digling on it you know

[01:30:28.830 --> 01:30:30.150]
I'll keep my...

[01:30:30.150 --> 01:30:35.430]
Here's an article that George is going to like this will make him feel better after I ripped him an ass about something which I forget what it was

[01:30:36.490 --> 01:30:38.170]
Steven Pizzle on this working chimps says

[01:30:38.170 --> 01:30:40.150]
How Walmart killed America's Golden Juice

[01:30:41.290 --> 01:30:42.350]
Doesn't it make you feel good?

[01:30:43.350 --> 01:30:43.710]
Okay

[01:30:44.910 --> 01:30:46.790]
I think it'd be more enthusiastic than that

[01:30:46.790 --> 01:30:48.690]
Sorry I didn't distract it

[01:30:48.690 --> 01:30:49.010]
Bye

[01:30:51.130 --> 01:30:51.930]
Thoughts of sex

[01:30:53.770 --> 01:30:56.110]
Or 18 we're finally making a little move on there good

[01:30:56.110 --> 01:30:57.550]
Oh scared the hell out of me

[01:30:57.550 --> 01:30:59.670]
I think Eric hit his thumb in it

[01:30:59.670 --> 01:31:01.050]
Wouldn't be the first time Eric

[01:31:01.050 --> 01:31:03.050]
Yeah he has nothing to do with this one

[01:31:03.050 --> 01:31:05.230]
I know I know that when you just...

[01:31:05.230 --> 01:31:07.110]
Well you know why are you so stupid

[01:31:07.110 --> 01:31:09.870]
I mean you take lessons at it or is it just since you worked at QAM

[01:31:09.870 --> 01:31:10.490]
Exactly

[01:31:11.290 --> 01:31:12.910]
And start looking at that paycheck

[01:31:12.910 --> 01:31:15.770]
Oh I still make a trap with a heavy heart sorry

[01:31:16.330 --> 01:31:20.110]
Steven Pizzle says I do believe we just heard the fat lady warming up in her dressing room

[01:31:20.110 --> 01:31:22.190]
After he has the lines from 16 tons

[01:31:22.190 --> 01:31:23.910]
You load 16 tons of what do you get?

[01:31:24.190 --> 01:31:25.550]
Another day older and deeper and dead

[01:31:25.550 --> 01:31:27.570]
Same Peter North to call me because I can't go

[01:31:27.570 --> 01:31:29.490]
I owe my sold of a company store

[01:31:29.490 --> 01:31:32.010]
I'm not going to sing it because I ain't no Tennessee or any Schwartz

[01:31:34.330 --> 01:31:40.170]
Walmart stores anchor reported a lower than expected quarterly profit and cut its full year earnings forecast on Tuesday

[01:31:40.170 --> 01:31:43.070]
Saying its customers remain under economic pressure

[01:31:43.070 --> 01:31:48.090]
It's no secret that many customers are running out of money toward the end of the month Scott said on a recorded conference call

[01:31:48.730 --> 01:31:50.990]
What the great American working class running out of money?

[01:31:51.110 --> 01:31:51.650]
How can that be?

[01:31:51.810 --> 01:31:55.130]
Steven Pizzle? Well to begin with they aren't the American working class anymore

[01:31:55.130 --> 01:31:57.010]
They become the Walmart working class

[01:31:57.010 --> 01:31:58.970]
Yes Walmart is a nation

[01:31:58.970 --> 01:32:01.870]
To be precise it's the world's fourth largest economy

[01:32:01.870 --> 01:32:06.310]
Over the last decade or so Walmart has had more impact on lives of American working class families

[01:32:06.310 --> 01:32:09.250]
From the working poor to skilled blue collar workers than Uncle Sam

[01:32:09.990 --> 01:32:14.350]
The Walmart nation is comprised of roughly 127 million former American workers

[01:32:14.350 --> 01:32:19.070]
With more than 127 million customers visiting a US Walmart store or a sand club

[01:32:19.070 --> 01:32:20.950]
Where house location in America every week

[01:32:20.950 --> 01:32:24.570]
The company is considered a barometer of the half of this nation's retail sector

[01:32:24.570 --> 01:32:28.110]
The deal according to the free trade free market conservatives went like this

[01:32:28.110 --> 01:32:32.350]
One allow Walmart and other super discount stores to devastate local small businesses

[01:32:32.350 --> 01:32:35.690]
Because two such large retailers bring economies of scale

[01:32:35.690 --> 01:32:39.830]
Lower prices and create more new jobs and the jobs lost in the once-local-owned retail sector

[01:32:40.350 --> 01:32:44.190]
Three allow these Walmart types to import unlimited goods from cheap labor countries like China

[01:32:44.190 --> 01:32:48.270]
Even though just doing so destroys high paying US manufacturing jobs because four

[01:32:48.270 --> 01:32:51.130]
US workers must adjust to compete in the new global economy

[01:32:51.130 --> 01:32:55.290]
And even though they're once high paying manufacturing jobs will be replaced with lower paying service sector jobs

[01:32:55.290 --> 01:32:58.670]
Like those $10 an hour jobs at Walmart they won't feel the pain because five

[01:32:58.670 --> 01:33:02.270]
US workers will be able to buy the imported stuff for so much less at Walmart

[01:33:03.810 --> 01:33:07.530]
So you know win win right? No it never was and now we can prove it

[01:33:08.830 --> 01:33:12.150]
Walmart cut the golden goose open figuring could grab all the gold for itself

[01:33:12.150 --> 01:33:15.530]
Now all they and we have to show for it is its goose on life support

[01:33:16.470 --> 01:33:20.730]
For a while anyway many displaced American workers bonded at Walmart's very daily economic analysis

[01:33:20.730 --> 01:33:24.510]
In the beginning they flocked to their local Walmart to scarf up VCRs and TVs

[01:33:24.510 --> 01:33:30.130]
And chic furniture clothing and shoes all that prices that are fractured with their local merchant merchants once charged

[01:33:30.730 --> 01:33:34.390]
Then they shopped Walmart because local Merconte Alibin driven out of business

[01:33:34.390 --> 01:33:37.370]
But never mind even though they were now earning half what they used to

[01:33:37.370 --> 01:33:42.390]
Easy credit and home refinances were keeping them in the black and those Walmart prices were so low how could they resist

[01:33:43.110 --> 01:33:48.450]
Then the music slowed credit got tidest suddenly working people and it started living within their new low-age reality

[01:33:48.450 --> 01:33:52.090]
From that point on they shopped at Walmart because they couldn't afford a shop any place else

[01:33:52.090 --> 01:33:57.130]
Which was likely Walmart's plan all along high fives around all around at Walmart headquarters

[01:33:57.130 --> 01:34:02.310]
For a few brief moments in time Walmart created a retailist paradise albeit a fool's paradise

[01:34:02.310 --> 01:34:09.430]
Low-age slave workers 127 million of them every week marching slack-jawed across giant parking lots into Walmart from coast to coast

[01:34:10.090 --> 01:34:15.350]
Each little peasant family clutching that week's meager earnings with with which they purchased all their basic needs

[01:34:15.350 --> 01:34:19.950]
Made by even lower paid Chinese peasants from Walmart and left for charge for the lead content

[01:34:20.650 --> 01:34:24.330]
Now we see the beginning of the end of that too the once vibrant American working class

[01:34:24.330 --> 01:34:28.430]
The goose that lay generations of golden eggs for American Americans is now under hospice care

[01:34:28.430 --> 01:34:30.550]
One foot in the grave and the other on a banana peel

[01:34:31.070 --> 01:34:36.070]
And what will go down in economic history is a classic come-up in Walmart is itself about to give the same

[01:34:36.670 --> 01:34:40.810]
Marco economic reality check and handed out to its local competitors and American workers

[01:34:41.430 --> 01:34:45.050]
And what about all those American workers Walmart screwed blue and tattooed

[01:34:45.050 --> 01:34:49.930]
What are they feeling now? Not good and they have their own way of saying up yours to the focus

[01:34:49.930 --> 01:34:51.590]
Who helped engineer this mouth out?

[01:34:52.830 --> 01:34:56.290]
An addition show said Walmart was considered contending with higher levels of shrink

[01:34:56.290 --> 01:35:02.210]
Inventory that's lost to employee theft and shoplifting if you think about the macro environment where customers are under pressure

[01:35:02.210 --> 01:35:05.950]
There's generally a correlation between theft and macroeconomic pressure show said

[01:35:05.950 --> 01:35:10.890]
Unfortunately, that's what we're saying if you can't afford to buy it steal it

[01:35:12.130 --> 01:35:13.030]
What do you think?

[01:35:14.490 --> 01:35:15.210]
Works for me?

[01:35:15.210 --> 01:35:17.330]
We got 13 left

[01:35:18.490 --> 01:35:21.890]
So we're not going to break your record I don't think I think you're safe not this week

[01:35:21.890 --> 01:35:25.070]
Well it's the 16th of august for Christchurch who the hell is around right?

[01:35:25.490 --> 01:35:28.270]
I don't know I think we did just a little bit more Elvis

[01:35:28.270 --> 01:35:29.210]
Oh god

[01:35:30.530 --> 01:35:31.570]
Is this the place?

[01:35:31.950 --> 01:35:32.870]
Yeah I'm certain

[01:35:33.550 --> 01:35:35.370]
He's here every Thursday night

[01:35:36.070 --> 01:35:36.970]
I don't think

[01:35:37.350 --> 01:35:38.690]
Like no man I hear not go ahead

[01:35:39.390 --> 01:35:40.910]
See that guy? Go back away?

[01:35:40.970 --> 01:35:42.210]
We'll get up that broad street

[01:35:42.790 --> 01:35:43.630]
Oh yeah

[01:35:44.210 --> 01:35:45.070]
That's gotta be him

[01:35:45.870 --> 01:35:47.090]
I'm gonna sway now

[01:35:47.930 --> 01:35:49.370]
Hey dad, back at one

[01:35:50.210 --> 01:35:51.630]
Belle, you scared?

[01:35:52.030 --> 01:35:53.190]
Why sweetly

[01:35:53.190 --> 01:35:55.310]
Belle, then I go way back with this here

[01:35:56.390 --> 01:35:59.370]
We use the pleasure ourselves to bend the handle

[01:36:01.670 --> 01:36:03.050]
See that? Have a good turn

[01:36:03.050 --> 01:36:04.450]
Sure, sure

[01:36:04.450 --> 01:36:06.650]
Look, I'm having fun already

[01:36:06.650 --> 01:36:09.410]
We, we

[01:36:09.410 --> 01:36:10.610]
We, we, we, we

[01:36:10.610 --> 01:36:13.010]
Alright he's got it the Astorboard

[01:36:13.010 --> 01:36:13.610]
Okay

[01:36:14.590 --> 01:36:16.590]
And it's sure you get it in the right spot

[01:36:16.590 --> 01:36:20.110]
You don't want to hide no pin in the ass by sexual stations

[01:36:21.350 --> 01:36:22.030]
Okay, I'd say

[01:36:22.950 --> 01:36:26.670]
You know, Joe says once we finish him off I get my old job that, see that

[01:36:26.670 --> 01:36:29.010]
Yeah, you're just joking around anywhere now

[01:36:29.010 --> 01:36:31.410]
Okay, now spray him

[01:36:32.570 --> 01:36:35.350]
Hey, we'll never pour in my august out

[01:36:46.070 --> 01:36:48.830]
Bye.

[01:36:54.230 --> 01:36:54.230]

[01:36:58.410 --> 01:36:59.110]
Bye.

[01:37:00.430 --> 01:37:00.430]

[01:37:00.550 --> 01:37:01.990]
Bye.

[01:37:02.630 --> 01:37:04.130]
Bye.

[01:37:15.690 --> 01:37:16.010]
Why?

[01:37:17.430 --> 01:37:21.530]
1217 mca and we still got 13 certificates left for the prime blue grill.

[01:37:21.530 --> 01:37:22.210]
I don't believe that.

[01:37:22.330 --> 01:37:23.370]
Do you?

[01:37:23.390 --> 01:37:24.650]
Yeah, I have to believe it.

[01:37:24.770 --> 01:37:25.370]
Why is that?

[01:37:26.270 --> 01:37:27.450]
It's what it says there.

[01:37:27.890 --> 01:37:28.470]
That's what it says.

[01:37:28.630 --> 01:37:30.350]
Well, it's always what it says is what it is.

[01:37:30.490 --> 01:37:32.070]
It just, it got to stop.

[01:37:32.950 --> 01:37:33.870]
It just stopped.

[01:37:34.550 --> 01:37:35.850]
Maybe there only 30 people listening.

[01:37:36.070 --> 01:37:37.770]
Maybe there only 30 people listening.

[01:37:37.870 --> 01:37:38.190]
Maybe there only 30 people listening.

[01:37:38.390 --> 01:37:38.730]
Maybe there only 30 people listening.

[01:37:39.310 --> 01:37:40.590]
Maybe there's only 30 people left.

[01:37:43.110 --> 01:37:43.430]
37.

[01:37:44.870 --> 01:37:46.170]
Don't sure change me now.

[01:37:48.010 --> 01:37:48.330]
13.

[01:37:48.670 --> 01:37:50.170]
What do you think Chris is that legit or what?

[01:37:50.670 --> 01:37:51.810]
Yeah, I got to go with it being legit.

[01:37:51.890 --> 01:37:52.910]
On a great place like this?

[01:37:53.230 --> 01:37:54.170]
Yeah, they just all have to be doing.

[01:37:54.470 --> 01:37:55.350]
Yeah, I give these things people.

[01:37:56.670 --> 01:37:57.330]
Give them a little time.

[01:37:57.470 --> 01:37:58.350]
Okay, there are 13 left.

[01:37:58.530 --> 01:38:00.990]
They hop on to wqm.com and click that baby.

[01:38:01.770 --> 01:38:02.850]
And do something with it.

[01:38:03.070 --> 01:38:04.590]
$100 to get for only 50 bucks.

[01:38:04.810 --> 01:38:07.470]
You have to be crazy to pass up on a good place like this.

[01:38:07.730 --> 01:38:10.590]
But nevertheless, we do have a lot of crazy people out there.

[01:38:10.670 --> 01:38:11.870]
In case you missed those calls earlier.

[01:38:12.430 --> 01:38:14.890]
Yeah, there's something wrong with it because it's still just stuck on 13.

[01:38:16.210 --> 01:38:17.450]
You really believe that?

[01:38:17.610 --> 01:38:18.550]
It doesn't work like that.

[01:38:18.770 --> 01:38:20.490]
Well, why don't you buy one if you have it all come down?

[01:38:21.190 --> 01:38:23.990]
Why don't you buy one if you see if it'll come down, Mr. Hotshot?

[01:38:24.210 --> 01:38:24.490]
I'm doing a good job here.

[01:38:24.490 --> 01:38:25.670]
Because I'm like a weak pay for me.

[01:38:26.170 --> 01:38:27.710]
I don't have a time to posky around with that.

[01:38:27.930 --> 01:38:29.190]
Why doesn't George buy a couple?

[01:38:29.190 --> 01:38:29.530]
A few.

[01:38:30.510 --> 01:38:32.210]
That's a half a day's pay for him.

[01:38:34.950 --> 01:38:38.450]
With the Wall Street Journal as the latest edition was vast media empire,

[01:38:38.750 --> 01:38:44.070]
Rupert Murdoch Times to take aim at the New York Times says Nick Julianna on the raw story.

[01:38:45.170 --> 01:38:47.910]
Rupert thinks the Times is vulnerable, long time executive in Murdoch's news,

[01:38:47.970 --> 01:38:48.810]
corrupt all the LA Times.

[01:38:49.110 --> 01:38:49.990]
He's going to go after them.

[01:38:51.010 --> 01:38:53.850]
Rupert Murdoch, the Antichrist, there's the 360's on his forehead.

[01:38:55.090 --> 01:38:57.650]
Murdoch has made clear his intention to boost the journal's news coverage

[01:38:57.650 --> 01:39:01.350]
by adding four pages to the paper and having additional reporters in Europe and Asia

[01:39:01.350 --> 01:39:03.950]
to expand the way the market's down to 32, the Dow.

[01:39:05.190 --> 01:39:07.930]
And having additional reporters in Europe and Asia to expand the papers

[01:39:07.930 --> 01:39:10.970]
franchise on global business news on a conference call last week.

[01:39:11.050 --> 01:39:15.170]
Murdoch said he wanted the journal to have more coverage of national international and non-business news,

[01:39:15.510 --> 01:39:18.510]
all to the better, all the better to compete with the New York Times on the national newspapers.

[01:39:19.470 --> 01:39:22.210]
Although Murdoch declared he wouldn't engage in any price war,

[01:39:22.330 --> 01:39:24.590]
analysts expected to lower the journal's news stand price,

[01:39:24.590 --> 01:39:26.490]
which rose to a buck and a half last month.

[01:39:26.850 --> 01:39:30.670]
Some current and former employee speculated that his boasting about enhancements to the news operation

[01:39:30.670 --> 01:39:35.050]
were meant to draw attention from a more immediate plan to attack the New York Times' business side.

[01:39:35.810 --> 01:39:38.210]
I would expect that he'd be very aggressive on ad rates

[01:39:38.210 --> 01:39:40.470]
and I would also predict he'd be very aggressive on cover price,

[01:39:40.770 --> 01:39:42.090]
whether it's home delivery or news stand,

[01:39:42.230 --> 01:39:44.290]
said Ken Chandler, who's 29 years under Murdoch,

[01:39:44.610 --> 01:39:47.670]
included Stintz's publisher New York Post, editor of the Boston Herald.

[01:39:48.510 --> 01:39:50.630]
An article in Crane's New York business early this month,

[01:39:50.770 --> 01:39:53.870]
speculated that Murdoch could be sewing the seeds for an out-and-out newspaper war

[01:39:53.870 --> 01:39:55.730]
between the Wall Street Journal and New York Times,

[01:39:56.050 --> 01:39:58.730]
mimicking the battle of oil between the city's two tabloids,

[01:39:59.070 --> 01:40:01.610]
the news corp on New York Post and New York Daily News.

[01:40:02.230 --> 01:40:04.750]
Murdoch will do anything to take market share away from the time.

[01:40:04.850 --> 01:40:06.470]
He's gotten farther than anybody else,

[01:40:06.770 --> 01:40:08.790]
and can afford to wonder, cut anybody else, martin, done,

[01:40:09.430 --> 01:40:12.110]
deputy publisher of the Daily News and former Murdoch Lieutenant-Till's Crane.

[01:40:12.410 --> 01:40:15.190]
Anyone who thinks he will play by our mark test of Queen's Berry rules

[01:40:15.190 --> 01:40:17.090]
is living in a cloud-coucoucou-land.

[01:40:18.990 --> 01:40:20.610]
Living in cloud-coucoucou-land?

[01:40:20.610 --> 01:40:21.170]
Okay.

[01:40:21.690 --> 01:40:23.810]
Analyst predict Murdoch will slash advertising rates

[01:40:23.810 --> 01:40:25.950]
and work at stealing advertisers from the times.

[01:40:26.390 --> 01:40:28.470]
In Britain, he's so grossly underpriced the times of London

[01:40:28.470 --> 01:40:30.110]
that it's been very hard for the other newspapers,

[01:40:30.510 --> 01:40:32.010]
the independent, the guardian of telegraph,

[01:40:32.310 --> 01:40:34.510]
to charge with the oughta be charging their readers and their advertisers,

[01:40:34.510 --> 01:40:37.370]
Bruce Page said, author of the Murdoch Archipelago,

[01:40:37.410 --> 01:40:39.430]
a critical look at the news in the court-manpire.

[01:40:39.850 --> 01:40:42.010]
He says, I think the Times in New York is very vulnerable.

[01:40:42.610 --> 01:40:45.430]
In June, the New York Times published a lengthy two-part investigation

[01:40:45.430 --> 01:40:48.910]
at Murdoch's business dealings that stretched more than 7,500 words

[01:40:48.910 --> 01:40:51.770]
of the series' outline accusations of editorial meddling by Murdoch.

[01:40:52.110 --> 01:40:55.010]
After he took over newspapers and his dealings with government leaders in China.

[01:40:56.090 --> 01:40:58.310]
In an editorial earlier this month, the Times said it was paying

[01:40:58.310 --> 01:41:01.370]
an anxious attention to Murdoch's purchase of Dow Jones and Company

[01:41:01.370 --> 01:41:02.150]
which owns the journal.

[01:41:02.590 --> 01:41:05.050]
Mr. Murdoch has bought one of the great newspapers in the world

[01:41:05.050 --> 01:41:07.310]
who are one of the most sophisticated readerships in the world of Times.

[01:41:07.450 --> 01:41:09.690]
He said, those readers and all of us who care about journalism

[01:41:09.690 --> 01:41:13.030]
will be watching for any sign that news coverage is being splanded

[01:41:13.030 --> 01:41:14.490]
to create political, economic, favor.

[01:41:14.770 --> 01:41:17.090]
Not that he would do that, Mr. Murdoch, from Fox News.

[01:41:17.090 --> 01:41:20.550]
I'm in New York Post and the Iri other right-wing rag in the universe

[01:41:21.890 --> 01:41:22.870]
fascist bastard him.

[01:41:23.350 --> 01:41:26.230]
So what's the deal on here? We're still stuck on the 13th?

[01:41:26.230 --> 01:41:26.830]
Over down to 11.

[01:41:27.810 --> 01:41:30.050]
We don't know how you keep saying that there's something wrong with the Chris.

[01:41:30.210 --> 01:41:32.550]
We're down to 11. Have you just told these people we've got 11 certificates left?

[01:41:32.970 --> 01:41:35.150]
And they've got just a few minutes to cash in and give with it?

[01:41:35.610 --> 01:41:36.050]
Let's go people.

[01:41:36.550 --> 01:41:38.170]
Yeah, let's go people, people.

[01:41:39.290 --> 01:41:41.970]
At least a couple more went on there. Now down to 10, see?

[01:41:42.630 --> 01:41:44.570]
See, when it starts getting pretty grim and they're thinking like,

[01:41:44.950 --> 01:41:48.530]
I don't know, do I have the money? Like George, you know, he's loaded with cash.

[01:41:48.770 --> 01:41:49.550]
Oh yeah.

[01:41:50.810 --> 01:41:51.430]
10 left.

[01:41:52.810 --> 01:41:55.190]
So we sold a 40 in about 20 minutes. That's not too bad.

[01:41:55.490 --> 01:41:57.850]
Not like you did last week, but then again, I'm not you, you know.

[01:41:59.730 --> 01:42:03.550]
875 votes on the poll, which means we're going to be way over 900 by one o'clock.

[01:42:04.350 --> 01:42:08.250]
Almost a lock by two o'clock for that thousand, when you agree?

[01:42:08.850 --> 01:42:08.990]
Yeah.

[01:42:11.150 --> 01:42:13.350]
I just think we can't compete with Jorge Siddano.

[01:42:14.950 --> 01:42:17.090]
Why, but what do you try? Why even try?

[01:42:17.510 --> 01:42:20.450]
We can't compete on the audience wants to do something named Jorge.

[01:42:21.050 --> 01:42:22.630]
That's what it's bottom line.

[01:42:23.250 --> 01:42:29.470]
Whether it's Jorge Rodriguez Jorge Siddano, Jorge Chorz, Chorz, Jones, Smith.

[01:42:30.910 --> 01:42:33.570]
Now let's take a look at the poll, which of course might be more important.

[01:42:34.910 --> 01:42:35.210]
Jorge!

[01:42:38.390 --> 01:42:39.350]
Jorge David.

[01:42:41.170 --> 01:42:42.710]
876 votes in Marlon Brandt.

[01:42:42.710 --> 01:42:44.730]
I can't believe we're going to be a thousand on this poll.

[01:42:44.930 --> 01:42:47.330]
I'm so embarrassed by the poll. I don't even want to read it.

[01:42:47.470 --> 01:42:49.090]
We do have 876 votes.

[01:42:50.870 --> 01:42:54.890]
Let's concentrate on selling those last 10 certificates from the Prime Blue Grille.

[01:42:55.070 --> 01:42:56.850]
Let's do that. Let's get that taken care of.

[01:42:56.930 --> 01:42:59.990]
And then we can worry about silly things like that dumbass poll, you know.

[01:43:01.610 --> 01:43:02.930]
Sure is slow, you know.

[01:43:03.690 --> 01:43:05.090]
You almost think it was like the middle of August.

[01:43:05.190 --> 01:43:07.630]
Although it didn't affect you last week, you broke the record last week.

[01:43:07.950 --> 01:43:11.570]
I think on Thursday, we have to like put you on like from 1130 to 1230.

[01:43:11.570 --> 01:43:12.690]
Yeah, an exchange for Wednesday.

[01:43:14.070 --> 01:43:14.670]
Wednesday what?

[01:43:14.910 --> 01:43:15.790]
You do the show on Wednesday.

[01:43:15.990 --> 01:43:17.730]
No, I said from 1130 to 1230.

[01:43:17.910 --> 01:43:18.610]
So you can't compare this.

[01:43:18.830 --> 01:43:21.910]
As you do this much better than I did, I had a pretty good speak going there for a while.

[01:43:24.910 --> 01:43:26.810]
What are you laughing about? What are you smirking about?

[01:43:27.130 --> 01:43:29.730]
I had two of my sold-out, looking for excuses to get out of work.

[01:43:30.130 --> 01:43:34.090]
Being the smart ass that you are, you sold out like in 14 minutes and broke the record.

[01:43:34.310 --> 01:43:34.990]
You broke our hearts.

[01:43:35.350 --> 01:43:36.390]
You're just looking at the way it's like.

[01:43:36.630 --> 01:43:37.190]
I'm struggling.

[01:43:37.310 --> 01:43:38.950]
Like the struggling lady would say, I'm struggling.

[01:43:39.950 --> 01:43:40.410]
I'm struggling.

[01:43:42.310 --> 01:43:44.410]
I still got those 10 left for Prime Blue Grant.

[01:43:44.510 --> 01:43:47.650]
And if it wasn't a really great place, I would say, well, you know, that figure is a whatever.

[01:43:47.830 --> 01:43:50.910]
It was some smart, hard to find location, which it is not.

[01:43:51.510 --> 01:43:53.230]
315 South Viscayne Boulevard of Miami.

[01:43:53.430 --> 01:43:55.750]
Anybody, even a blind man, can find that, you know.

[01:43:56.530 --> 01:43:57.730]
And it's a beautiful place.

[01:43:57.990 --> 01:44:01.810]
But we still have 10 of those hundred dollars certificate left and you can buy it for 50 bucks half price.

[01:44:03.890 --> 01:44:04.930]
I'm wxun.com.

[01:44:05.130 --> 01:44:08.190]
Now maybe it does have something to do with the fact that the thing is not working right that link.

[01:44:09.130 --> 01:44:14.530]
But like I said, if you go to the QM.com page and you go on the right hand column and you go about half of the way down or 2 thirds down,

[01:44:14.730 --> 01:44:18.390]
you'll see another thing with those same neat colors on there, you know, with my stupid picture on it.

[01:44:18.670 --> 01:44:20.710]
And you click on there and you'll hop right on that thing.

[01:44:21.130 --> 01:44:22.210]
That's a good excuse, isn't it?

[01:44:22.670 --> 01:44:22.790]
Sure.

[01:44:23.330 --> 01:44:25.050]
But as George keeps telling me, it's only me.

[01:44:25.170 --> 01:44:26.910]
Everybody else can get on that thing, it's only me.

[01:44:27.730 --> 01:44:28.430]
Let me try it again.

[01:44:28.550 --> 01:44:29.510]
Let me go back.

[01:44:31.270 --> 01:44:31.910]
WDQM.com.

[01:44:33.290 --> 01:44:34.330]
Come on, you can do it.

[01:44:34.630 --> 01:44:35.350]
It's not going back.

[01:44:36.870 --> 01:44:39.710]
If we don't sell those out by two o'clock, I'm not coming back tomorrow.

[01:44:40.010 --> 01:44:40.290]
Okay.

[01:44:40.550 --> 01:44:43.430]
I mean, wouldn't that be embarrassing?

[01:44:44.430 --> 01:44:44.910]
No.

[01:44:45.430 --> 01:44:48.190]
The ones legendary Neil Rogers wants the king.

[01:44:48.810 --> 01:44:51.530]
Well, they had the other king on, I think that killed it.

[01:44:56.590 --> 01:44:57.630]
I'm cyber gassed.

[01:44:57.990 --> 01:45:03.650]
I'm not really getting in the beginning when you start clicking on it, you see, 48, 45, 41, 37.

[01:45:03.650 --> 01:45:04.430]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:45:05.190 --> 01:45:09.170]
And they're hopping them up like gold, man, like we were giving away a million dollar bills on there.

[01:45:09.970 --> 01:45:13.990]
And now, in all of a sense, I think it's a function of this damn thing, this site.

[01:45:14.930 --> 01:45:16.890]
Whoever the scoop ball is, who's in charge of this thing?

[01:45:18.150 --> 01:45:19.530]
You only yell at Josh or someone else.

[01:45:19.950 --> 01:45:20.830]
No, no, you don't yell at anybody.

[01:45:21.170 --> 01:45:22.350]
It's just, it's my failure, man.

[01:45:22.450 --> 01:45:23.310]
I take full responsibility.

[01:45:23.430 --> 01:45:26.810]
Just like George W. Bush, I take full responsibility for my failure.

[01:45:27.030 --> 01:45:28.350]
I'm not getting the job done, okay?

[01:45:28.650 --> 01:45:30.830]
So I think we bring in George from 1230 to 2.

[01:45:32.930 --> 01:45:37.790]
Stance of power, manure, covers over this performance by the Dalton.

[01:45:38.030 --> 01:45:38.470]
Absolutely.

[01:45:40.490 --> 01:45:44.390]
We got eight left, ATE, eight.

[01:45:44.990 --> 01:45:50.110]
I can't believe what I just saw that woman do.

[01:45:52.130 --> 01:45:57.030]
I reached up and grabbed my husband's joke.

[01:45:58.970 --> 01:46:04.030]
She's lucky I didn't jump right off the stage.

[01:46:05.070 --> 01:46:10.310]
And then take her out with just one punch.

[01:46:10.910 --> 01:46:13.250]
Because you know you shouldn't squeeze.

[01:46:13.510 --> 01:46:18.130]
You better let the meat, keep your hands on the family juice.

[01:46:18.730 --> 01:46:23.490]
It's really kind of rude to grab this back and try it from me.

[01:46:24.910 --> 01:46:27.050]
No, but you can't touch.

[01:46:27.310 --> 01:46:28.590]
You shouldn't gather none.

[01:46:29.110 --> 01:46:32.750]
Lady, you better learn your things before.

[01:46:34.030 --> 01:46:35.470]
To me.

[01:46:38.810 --> 01:46:41.250]
You know you shouldn't squeeze.

[01:46:46.170 --> 01:46:47.890]
Josh, please.

[01:46:50.030 --> 01:46:51.090]
Yes, squeeze this baby.

[01:46:51.390 --> 01:46:52.590]
1232 at 560 W.

[01:46:52.690 --> 01:46:55.490]
We got mad dog from Kansas City coming up at 2 before the game.

[01:46:55.510 --> 01:46:58.750]
And then we have 85 hours of a pregame for the dolphins in Kansas City.

[01:46:59.130 --> 01:47:00.270]
That's why we're hurting a little bit today.

[01:47:00.370 --> 01:47:01.550]
Because they're all whipped up about the football.

[01:47:01.930 --> 01:47:01.930]

[01:47:02.190 --> 01:47:03.410]
And you're not talking about football, man.

[01:47:03.850 --> 01:47:04.190]
Give me the ball.

[01:47:07.550 --> 01:47:07.870]
Okay.

[01:47:09.770 --> 01:47:10.950]
We got seven now.

[01:47:11.170 --> 01:47:11.330]
See?

[01:47:11.950 --> 01:47:12.130]
See that?

[01:47:12.290 --> 01:47:13.030]
If you'd say give me the ball.

[01:47:13.230 --> 01:47:14.730]
There went another one right out the window.

[01:47:14.730 --> 01:47:15.510]
Feel fast.

[01:47:18.330 --> 01:47:21.070]
Aren't you perplexed that this is taking so long or do you get the feeling?

[01:47:21.550 --> 01:47:22.010]
I don't know.

[01:47:22.790 --> 01:47:25.630]
Maybe it's because it's in downtown and people are like, oh, it's in downtown.

[01:47:25.930 --> 01:47:26.210]
I don't know.

[01:47:26.330 --> 01:47:27.570]
I'm just throwing guesses out there.

[01:47:30.870 --> 01:47:32.590]
You think maybe because there's nobody there?

[01:47:33.330 --> 01:47:34.010]
That could be too.

[01:47:34.090 --> 01:47:34.770]
There's nobody around.

[01:47:35.270 --> 01:47:35.870]
That could be too.

[01:47:36.130 --> 01:47:36.850]
Man, that's a good excuse.

[01:47:37.210 --> 01:47:38.730]
Come on, let's make up some excuses.

[01:47:40.790 --> 01:47:41.730]
It's cloudy today.

[01:47:42.290 --> 01:47:43.250]
Yeah, that's a good reason.

[01:47:44.010 --> 01:47:45.170]
People ain't got no money.

[01:47:47.210 --> 01:47:48.430]
People have bad taste.

[01:47:48.670 --> 01:47:52.150]
If it's a really great place like the prime blue grill, there are a little leery of it, you know.

[01:47:52.550 --> 01:47:54.110]
That's a little bit too good for my taste.

[01:47:55.530 --> 01:47:57.070]
We'd rather go to crystal, you know.

[01:47:57.770 --> 01:47:59.150]
Not that there's anything wrong with crystal.

[01:47:59.150 --> 01:48:00.210]
It's just kind of a different thing.

[01:48:01.150 --> 01:48:03.250]
So we got seven left of those $100 certificates.

[01:48:03.590 --> 01:48:06.110]
And now, you know, what do we're going to say to WQM.com?

[01:48:06.930 --> 01:48:09.830]
Buy them up or just let me sit here and weep.

[01:48:10.030 --> 01:48:10.230]
Like that.

[01:48:10.270 --> 01:48:12.490]
Like a beaten old man.

[01:48:12.490 --> 01:48:14.970]
Let me just sit here and weep.

[01:48:15.290 --> 01:48:16.970]
A US anti-war group has been warmed.

[01:48:17.070 --> 01:48:17.690]
It'll be warned.

[01:48:18.130 --> 01:48:24.290]
It'll be fine $10,000 if it doesn't move posters in Washington announcing a March in the Capitol next month against US involvement in Iraq.

[01:48:24.470 --> 01:48:36.970]
A spokesman said yesterday, the answer coalition has received citations from the authorities in Washington threatened to find us $10,000 unless several hundred posters announcing the September 15th March in Washington DC are removed.

[01:48:37.170 --> 01:48:37.690]
So it's flown.

[01:48:37.950 --> 01:48:39.970]
The staff coordinator for the anti-war group said,

[01:48:40.450 --> 01:48:43.590]
we have until Thursday meaning today to take the posters down.

[01:48:43.910 --> 01:48:54.730]
Several hundred yellow posters have been put up around Washington announcing the protest, which is time to coincide with a release of that report by US military commander in Iraq General David Patras on progress in the US surge strategy of raising troop levels.

[01:48:55.970 --> 01:49:01.030]
Washington City authorities said the posters have to come down because they were stuck on with adhesive that didn't meet city regulations.

[01:49:01.450 --> 01:49:04.050]
The charge about adhesives is false, Sloan said.

[01:49:05.250 --> 01:49:13.610]
This is definitely a calculated political move aimed at disrupting the demonstration, which has become organized on the day when the world's eyes will be on Washington for the Patras report she be saying.

[01:49:14.470 --> 01:49:23.430]
Demonstrated is from at least 90 cities around the US and Canada have already pledged to come to Washington for the March, which will be part of a week of anti-war protest led by veterans of the Iraq war according to Sloan.

[01:49:23.430 --> 01:49:33.670]
A petition calling for the impeachment of President George W. Bush allegedly carrying a million signatures and endorsed by former US Attorney General Ramsey Clark will also be submitted to officials during the week's activities.

[01:49:34.350 --> 01:49:40.550]
During the festivities, baby, there's Jose Padilla who used to be Jose Padilla and then he was Jose Padilla and I was Jose Padilla again.

[01:49:41.250 --> 01:49:43.390]
And you know what, I don't think he did not and we got six left.

[01:49:44.970 --> 01:49:55.890]
See, we keep banging away on this thing on prime blue grill. We're going to get them all sold out, but it's just disappointing to me because if we had 80's and people out there listening like we used to back in the salad days, remember those days when we had an audience?

[01:49:57.110 --> 01:49:57.250]
Nope.

[01:49:57.910 --> 01:49:58.630]
It was long time ago.

[01:50:01.210 --> 01:50:05.550]
It's certainly predated the joe, the fat ass jolly joe days, I'll take it that. Wow.

[01:50:06.550 --> 01:50:13.070]
If we were doing this kind of thing back in those days, we just sold these out in five minutes. I'll bet you was life on it.

[01:50:14.370 --> 01:50:16.550]
Now we're down to five. There goes another one.

[01:50:19.010 --> 01:50:25.530]
Five more. If we can just get these all cleared out by one o'clock, won't you feel better about life?

[01:50:26.450 --> 01:50:27.010]
Okay, sure.

[01:50:28.010 --> 01:50:30.150]
In other words, you don't care about this either. Is that what you're saying?

[01:50:30.270 --> 01:50:33.990]
Of course I care, but you don't care about any push so hard. All right, that's the right. I don't care.

[01:50:33.990 --> 01:50:37.270]
I got my food. I got my certificate. What do I get here?

[01:50:37.470 --> 01:50:38.990]
You got the one for the professor yet?

[01:50:39.050 --> 01:50:39.490]
Yes, I do.

[01:50:40.110 --> 01:50:40.950]
Do you? Yeah.

[01:50:42.190 --> 01:50:47.150]
Well, that's good because he might turn on your real fast. He turned on me this morning. I said, you know, I don't have an awful lot to write.

[01:50:47.270 --> 01:50:48.670]
Boy, he wrote me back four words. Yeah.

[01:50:50.050 --> 01:50:55.170]
Let's not get carried away, professor. Let's not underdo it. You know, it's one thing to overdo it. It's another thing to underdo it.

[01:50:55.510 --> 01:50:58.090]
But that's the way I am. You know, I'm easy with people. I'll let them off the hook.

[01:50:58.930 --> 01:51:02.430]
900 votes even on the pool. We're going to make a thousand. It's only 1236.

[01:51:02.670 --> 01:51:08.910]
There's my close personal friend, Susan Cadiada. He says the Padilla vertical. He read it two o'clock this afternoon.

[01:51:10.290 --> 01:51:15.870]
Just a bunch of, he did something. He's a terrorist. You know, I mean, dirty bomb, dirty bastard, dirty, whatever.

[01:51:16.970 --> 01:51:19.950]
Dirty Julio. I don't want to say, speak.

[01:51:21.130 --> 01:51:23.030]
Because then you'll pick up. You'll pick up on that.

[01:51:23.650 --> 01:51:28.130]
I'll stick up on it. We got those. Yeah. We got five left for a prime blue grill.

[01:51:28.970 --> 01:51:31.690]
And you people are breaking my heart today. I'm not coming back till Tuesday.

[01:51:33.230 --> 01:51:36.350]
Now, what are we, what are you telling me? Oh, you're going to feed me some crap Tuesday morning.

[01:51:36.350 --> 01:51:39.710]
Well, every morning between like eight, twenty and the 10, you feed me a lot of crap.

[01:51:42.750 --> 01:51:46.510]
So everybody is taking care of there. And that's all you care about. Is that you got yours? That's right.

[01:51:46.950 --> 01:51:50.310]
Well, I don't blame you. That's what we're going to have to start being a lot more selfish on this show.

[01:51:50.310 --> 01:51:54.770]
We want ours and for our friends. And that's it. Everybody else. That's all with you. Screw you.

[01:51:56.750 --> 01:52:00.710]
It's taken. We got to that 13. 13 was an unlucky number for us, man.

[01:52:00.770 --> 01:52:04.890]
And maybe lucky for a Danny Boy marino and Matt Sundine, but it's real unlucky for us.

[01:52:06.110 --> 01:52:09.670]
What other job were number 13? Chris, come on. You can come up with somebody beside those two.

[01:52:10.170 --> 01:52:11.950]
I thought you would have known Matt Sundine, but anyway.

[01:52:13.830 --> 01:52:20.290]
Anybody else? Yeah, I'm trying to think a bunch of other quarterbacks, but a bunch of other quarterbacks besides you.

[01:52:20.290 --> 01:52:22.110]
Danny Boy. Yeah, a couple other ones.

[01:52:22.150 --> 01:52:25.850]
Have a two on one. Here is set for hope. And it'll line a pass.

[01:52:26.410 --> 01:52:26.730]
Four.

[01:52:26.950 --> 01:52:28.690]
Have a five for a chipset wide of the goal.

[01:52:29.170 --> 01:52:30.850]
We're down to four now. Correct.

[01:52:31.730 --> 01:52:34.710]
Yeah, there it is. I just had to refresh it again. We're down to four.

[01:52:35.130 --> 01:52:37.970]
Well, look at it, Tom. It's just, I don't know why you're so impatient, George.

[01:52:40.150 --> 01:52:46.010]
I don't know why you make such a big, similar to butter. You know what the reason is that I do this because it's drama, baby.

[01:52:46.010 --> 01:52:51.450]
And when you're an old drama queen, you know about drama. Or is it drama? Or your mama?

[01:52:52.950 --> 01:52:58.910]
A little more Elvis will do it. Get those last four gone. You'll see. I don't want to play that cut again. I'll play it over and over.

[01:53:00.010 --> 01:53:02.290]
I got to know. I don't even know that song.

[01:53:04.030 --> 01:53:06.490]
Oh, yeah, I know that song. That's such like all the other ones.

[01:53:08.030 --> 01:53:08.930]
I have no idea.

[01:53:09.810 --> 01:53:14.970]
Get up in the morning. I feel my weak. The toss and I'm dead.

[01:53:15.370 --> 01:53:17.970]
I handle sleep. Baby. What rules up?

[01:53:18.030 --> 01:53:21.110]
You know, you're right. He really sucked that. He is just horrible.

[01:53:21.350 --> 01:53:25.710]
But it's one of those things. You know, he came along at the right time and they made a big stimulus about him.

[01:53:25.810 --> 01:53:31.010]
And they got all bent out of shape and all pissed off. And it's like kind of like me in a very small way.

[01:53:31.290 --> 01:53:34.630]
Down to two more. Down to two. Be too.

[01:53:35.750 --> 01:53:40.950]
I'll send you back. That's more that they rip you and ask and the more that they decry you the more success you have.

[01:53:41.350 --> 01:53:47.450]
Am I right? Seems to be crazy, but they give you a lot of free publicity and believe me on QA and we need all the free publicity you can get.

[01:53:47.710 --> 01:53:53.170]
Because we're losing our ass on the marlins year after year. This is the final year. Thank the Lord. Thank you.

[01:53:53.430 --> 01:54:00.850]
Oh, and that's the excuse. That's always the business. Oh, we don't have any budget for promotions because we're losing millions on the marlins among.

[01:54:00.850 --> 01:54:06.830]
Well, that's really good investment who made that deal by the way fat ass jolly joy could have been Greg Reed could have made that deal.

[01:54:08.430 --> 01:54:17.110]
Now they're sold out. Oh, hallelujah. Happy day. I have to play the Edwin Hawkins singers. Oh, happy day when Jesus was born.

[01:54:17.170 --> 01:54:25.890]
Come right up. I like that song. I don't know why it's there. There are actually some religious songs, even as much of a militant atheist designed.

[01:54:27.430 --> 01:54:37.790]
Like a lot of songs, holy songs and whatnot. Like Abbey Maria. Sure. Or a day by day. I got so I had Perry come on. I'm going to tell you.

[01:54:37.970 --> 01:54:45.670]
Oh, it was enough to make you cry. Could he belt it out or what? Don't step on it. Coming up.

[01:54:48.670 --> 01:54:59.610]
Oh, we're sold out for the prime rub blue grill. It was a real chore. I don't know why because you're going to love it. Those of you who bought the certificate on your auntie right now. In fact, George says if you don't love it, he'll give you your money back.

[01:55:01.070 --> 01:55:08.510]
Why did you chop it off before they sang when Jesus, whatever they say in the shop. Yeah, when Jesus walked on the water. Jesus Christ.

[01:55:08.510 --> 01:55:21.550]
What about you, man? Is she ever she even David Jesus Christ? What's going about Jesus that a lot of you going down on that is that he wasn't too crazy about going. I guess most of you folks don't know that we're getting really close to challenging that thousand.

[01:55:21.570 --> 01:55:25.550]
At least we're getting something done there until we get that thing straight out. You know, I'm doing.

[01:55:26.670 --> 01:55:35.170]
Oh, oh, I'm going to make me a hundred and thirty dropouts and that's just like in the last couple of minutes.

[01:55:36.710 --> 01:55:51.450]
What is that? Oh, and now look at that. Now it's back somebody just somebody somebody's back there did a little engineering. Okay, we hope you die. We hope you stick your finger in the transmitter socket. There is something and get fried like that black kid in I would deal with.

[01:55:51.470 --> 01:56:02.930]
Oh, it was his name. Don't tell me. He said Spencer. Yeah, Spencer not Spencer the car wash guy. The young guy named Spencer kid. He got fried. He got what was he sticking his finger back?

[01:56:04.750 --> 01:56:17.910]
No, seriously, what happened to him? All right, you know the mobile broadcast vehicles that radio stations have with the telescoping booms. Yes. All right. Now you're going to laugh because you think I'm making this up. But I'm not.

[01:56:18.970 --> 01:56:26.510]
Yeah, standing barefoot in a mud puddle holding the remote control to the you know the tax by the wire they have this remote control box to raise the boom.

[01:56:28.290 --> 01:56:43.130]
Yeah, the big giant telescoping antenna that comes out of the middle of those things. Yeah, so he got the market was down 304 but I was back to 295. Go ahead. I'm so he's standing barefoot in a mud puddle with the grams of thing with the box, the remote control box in his hand.

[01:56:43.130 --> 01:56:50.270]
And he raises the boom right into some high tension electrical wires and fried more than his ass.

[01:57:00.010 --> 01:57:07.350]
Well, here's the one that you like. I told you I had it because you like it so much. I'm playing it from now until midnight preemptive all games through them.

[01:57:21.810 --> 01:57:27.790]
Oh, there's a few of these that are like, you know, tolerable, not not good, but tolerable.

[01:57:27.790 --> 01:57:37.770]
Things still says we got those two left seal and noise me. I like to get that done over and finish and then move on to something else. It's not that I can't walk and chew gum at the same time. It's just that it's annoying.

[01:57:38.930 --> 01:57:51.710]
You get you get my drift. You just. God's warriors. The fact that they're actually going to put a three part series on CNN. They're going to rip religion the ass that it deserves. Does anybody believe that? No, of course not because it's bad for business.

[01:57:51.710 --> 01:58:01.410]
They got that bitch Christiana. I'm on poor and she's all the rest of she's got the big schmata on you know because she's talking to one of the if you could see in my building that I live in here.

[01:58:02.030 --> 01:58:13.590]
The number of these FTW future terrorists of the world. And these Muslim women, they're sleeping around like a half a dozen kids and they got one in the oven.

[01:58:13.590 --> 01:58:20.910]
And I can't and of course they're walking around. They got the full burger on you know and I'm thinking to myself, hey honey, you're covering the wrong part of your body.

[01:58:23.690 --> 01:58:33.770]
You know what I'm saying? Right. I hear you wrong in the wrong place. We need to put that cover in somewhere else soon fast.

[01:58:34.590 --> 01:58:42.950]
Well, they can just talk about multiplying like rabbits. Democrats seeking the White House have received more than four times as much money.

[01:58:43.110 --> 01:58:50.630]
Well, of course, you know, when you keep encouraging your kids to blow themselves up, you better have a lot of kids. You know, then they become much more dispensable that way like toilet paper.

[01:58:52.490 --> 01:58:59.290]
Democrats seeking the White House have received more than four times as much money from some of the nation's wealthiest enclaves as party contenders did in 2003.

[01:58:59.910 --> 01:59:13.350]
The major Democratic presidential candidates have raised nearly $32 million from the 50 zip codes that were the top sources of campaign running the first six months of the year, the nonprofit center for responsive politics found and contrasted Republicans received 13.8 million.

[01:59:13.670 --> 01:59:16.210]
Democrats, 32 million Republicans, 13.8.

[01:59:17.190 --> 01:59:25.910]
The analization for UIC today shows Democrats raised the most money and 43 of the 50 postal codes and guess who's the top recipient 28 of the areas sold out?

[01:59:27.750 --> 01:59:38.490]
Swirlery. Swirlery sold out? She sold out all right. She sold out to the Neocons, that bitch. And we are sold out again. Well, just keep watching it. Keep your fly on it.

[01:59:39.470 --> 01:59:47.430]
Okay. In the first half of 2003, John Kerry, Howard Dean, other Democrats who ran for president raised about 7.7 million from the top 50 donors of codes.

[01:59:47.430 --> 02:00:02.350]
President Bush who didn't actively raise money until May that year collected nearly 6 million in that period. The trend in giving from such upscaler areas such as Greenwich Connecticut is another sound of the financial demands for the 2008 election enjoyed by Democrats who bought raised the Republican counterparts by nearly $60 million.

[02:00:03.790 --> 02:00:10.350]
There's a lot of pet up demand by Democrats to win back the White House said John Green, a political scientist at the University of Accuracy in Ohio.

[02:00:11.090 --> 02:00:20.410]
Because fewer than 1% of all Americans donate to presidential campaigns, the contributions from Tony Neighborhoods also highlight that influence of that a tiny fraction of people will have on the contest.

[02:00:21.570 --> 02:00:28.490]
How much you give in George? How much you give in Chris? No. You give in a few thousand of the Barack Obama campaign or what? Definitely.

[02:00:29.650 --> 02:00:39.210]
Because let's see, in some ways the 2008 primary season won't be decided in the hard land of the swing states, but in upper east side departments, Beverly Hills mansions and Palm Beach Village, the center's folks in Massey, Ritz said.

[02:00:39.510 --> 02:00:51.150]
The analysis also found that donors living in New York's 1-0-0-1 zip code ranked first, providing more than 4.5 million. That's up from 1.2 million in the first six months of 2003 when the area was also the top source of presidential money.

[02:00:51.730 --> 02:00:57.390]
Clinton received the most 1.4 million dollars, followed by former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani with 941 grand.

[02:00:58.490 --> 02:01:09.350]
In investment banker, Giulia Bigfoot, who gave 46 hundred of the former first lady said, Clinton sent in a White House experienced maker the best candidate to cope with the Iraq war, which of course she voted for. My support for her is totally pragmatic.

[02:01:11.010 --> 02:01:20.730]
She said, areas trying to boost native sense of emergence of top money sources, donations to Illinois Senator Barack Obama made Chicago's Gold Coast number 17 on the list.

[02:01:20.730 --> 02:01:27.890]
Neither did Paradise Valley, Arizona make the list in 2003 where John McCain was its top recipient with 275 grand.

[02:01:28.250 --> 02:01:37.190]
It takes more money to run for presents and developer John Green, who donated 46 hundred to McCain. Everyone's ratcheted up their efforts to help. Are you ratcheting up your efforts? I'm not.

[02:01:38.670 --> 02:01:43.030]
Three of the seven zip codes were, I don't have the money after all these birthday parties and such and stuff like that.

[02:01:44.170 --> 02:01:50.830]
Three of the seven zip codes were Republicans who raised most money are in Texas. Giuliani, a partner in Houston-based law firm was leading recipient in all three.

[02:01:51.210 --> 02:01:58.130]
Some areas with close times to Bush are no longer top sources of donations among them north Dallas were Bush lived before he was elected governor of Texas.

[02:01:59.910 --> 02:02:02.230]
There's the king. He dances.

[02:02:03.130 --> 02:02:08.670]
And then he just got a kind of fun, each hip independently kind of walking there.

[02:02:08.670 --> 02:02:14.070]
He makes a living making fun of the rock legend who died 30 years ago.

[02:02:16.570 --> 02:02:23.010]
He's Chinese Elvis a wealthy man. Chinese Elvis could be more wealthy and has to be acknowledged and admitted.

[02:02:27.370 --> 02:02:35.870]
President is trained unofficially in Elvis's name. So does Sid Shaw. He's been dealing in memorabilia since the king's death.

[02:02:35.870 --> 02:02:38.770]
And he believes it's still a growth business.

[02:02:39.050 --> 02:02:45.470]
I must say he's getting people in big and not smaller. It's a legend which will go on forever.

[02:02:45.730 --> 02:02:48.650]
If CNN is around in a hundred years.

[02:02:49.190 --> 02:02:51.250]
The hundred and fifties.

[02:02:53.910 --> 02:02:55.070]
All right.

[02:03:03.010 --> 02:03:07.970]
I think this is a good way to get everybody ready for the 85 hours of dolphin pregame festivities. Don't you? Yes.

[02:03:08.350 --> 02:03:14.950]
So we're sold out on the prime officially sold out. Yes. We officially sold out. Correct. That's good.

[02:03:15.590 --> 02:03:21.270]
Why are people bothering me when I'm doing a... Yeah, I'm sorry. Me too. It's your close personal friend by the way, Dave.

[02:03:22.930 --> 02:03:29.510]
Well, he's in Tennessee. He's out of touch. Okay. I'm sorry. You ought to be sorry. Leave me alone. I'm doing a radio show. Not much of a radio show. Believe you me.

[02:03:29.730 --> 02:03:34.190]
We ought to take a lot more calls because that was a good fory we had there for a while. You know what? Yeah.

[02:03:34.590 --> 02:03:35.570]
30 Q.A.M. Hello.

[02:03:37.130 --> 02:03:37.850]
Hey. Yes.

[02:03:38.630 --> 02:03:43.250]
Elvis's mother was so ugly she ain't calling on a cop through a chain link fence. Oh!

[02:03:45.470 --> 02:03:46.670]
How many Q.A.M. Hello?

[02:03:47.450 --> 02:03:52.790]
I like to smell the bag. Okay. Good. Yes. Smell this.

[02:03:54.470 --> 02:04:01.710]
935 votes on the poll about the Godfather. We're going to make the thousand and then Charlie B's going to say, see I told you he was really good poll. No, it wasn't. It sucked.

[02:04:02.170 --> 02:04:07.930]
It was embarrassing. Well, here's what we haven't played yet. Thank God. It flows really bad.

[02:04:09.610 --> 02:04:10.630]
I mean, what is this?

[02:04:12.090 --> 02:04:19.990]
I mean, when you come right down to it, is that music? I never called it that. Wow. Although here's a song I do like now.

[02:04:21.570 --> 02:04:25.870]
This one ain't bad. Even you hard-ass might like it.

[02:04:28.390 --> 02:04:31.950]
Well, I can't say that sucks. I thought it was good.

[02:04:37.130 --> 02:04:39.490]
I like that. Other version of that.

[02:04:40.010 --> 02:04:44.370]
I got my car perfect. Sure. I wrote it and sang it and it hit on it. Of course, Elvis stealed it.

[02:04:45.370 --> 02:04:50.790]
He could have done anything. He could have sang and sung and mumbled and whatever. And he did.

[02:04:51.450 --> 02:04:57.910]
Because that was just, you know, in its day, back in the day. He was just bigger than life itself in more ways than once.

[02:04:58.910 --> 02:05:04.230]
1256 at all Elvis Radio. We're changing the format by the way after the often game is over after Finn's final.

[02:05:04.450 --> 02:05:06.610]
We're going all Elvis for the rest of the weekend.

[02:05:06.770 --> 02:05:13.350]
It's Scott Barrell. And when I'm up in Boca Tiga slapping all women with painted lips around the pool, I listen to the old Rogers Wonder 2 hour.

[02:05:14.050 --> 02:05:17.350]
I mean, I listen to the old Rogers' hair and balance Wonder 2 hour.

[02:05:17.350 --> 02:05:18.870]
Well, well, well, well, well.

[02:05:47.350 --> 02:05:50.370]
Since his asses where you kept your hair.

[02:05:51.410 --> 02:05:51.930]
Back home.

[02:05:52.090 --> 02:05:53.350]
Back home.

[02:06:17.490 --> 02:06:20.550]
It's quite a good Christian Republican boyfriend.

[02:06:20.790 --> 02:06:22.150]
For you, windshield.

[02:06:24.810 --> 02:06:25.330]
Wow.

[02:06:26.530 --> 02:06:28.950]
TKFW Institute.

[02:06:32.250 --> 02:06:35.690]
Love me tender.

[02:06:36.130 --> 02:06:36.630]
Boy.

[02:06:37.070 --> 02:06:37.810]
I'm sweet.

[02:06:39.350 --> 02:06:42.690]
Never let me go.

[02:06:44.250 --> 02:06:45.810]
It's Elvis 30 years, baby.

[02:06:46.230 --> 02:06:48.490]
30 years ago today.

[02:06:48.670 --> 02:06:49.710]
I just think it could have been 40.

[02:06:50.410 --> 02:06:50.990]
What is it?

[02:06:51.190 --> 02:06:52.890]
It could have been 40 if you could just take a more drug center.

[02:06:53.430 --> 02:06:53.930]
That's correct.

[02:06:54.930 --> 02:06:57.610]
But then we have to miss out on a lot of those great songs that you love so much.

[02:06:58.970 --> 02:06:59.610]
Like this.

[02:07:03.810 --> 02:07:04.690]
Oh, now here's the one.

[02:07:06.850 --> 02:07:08.090]
That's kind of the sour guitar.

[02:07:09.550 --> 02:07:10.190]
The sour.

[02:07:10.190 --> 02:07:10.610]
The sour.

[02:07:13.930 --> 02:07:15.010]
Make me feel real.

[02:07:15.330 --> 02:07:16.910]
I get the feeling you don't like the king.

[02:07:17.270 --> 02:07:19.250]
I get the feeling you're a little anti- Elvis.

[02:07:19.870 --> 02:07:21.210]
I am a little anti- Elvis.

[02:07:21.870 --> 02:07:25.190]
940 votes out in full, which is good, because 940 is where we got the Marlin game tonight,

[02:07:25.270 --> 02:07:27.110]
because we got the Dolphin Exhibitions game on QA.

[02:07:27.370 --> 02:07:30.850]
It's in the contract that if the world is coming to an end,

[02:07:30.910 --> 02:07:33.790]
we still have to carry the Dolphin game on QA no matter what else is going on in the world.

[02:07:34.090 --> 02:07:36.170]
We got to carry the Dolphin, because we are obsessed.

[02:07:36.510 --> 02:07:37.770]
We're insane with it.

[02:07:38.190 --> 02:07:40.990]
We got that Aqua and Orange coming out of our ass.

[02:07:41.230 --> 02:07:42.010]
We're so obsessed with it.

[02:07:42.010 --> 02:07:43.810]
At least some of us do not mean it.

[02:07:44.970 --> 02:07:45.890]
No way who's a.

[02:07:46.070 --> 02:07:47.770]
There's no way I'm jumping on that bandwagon.

[02:07:47.990 --> 02:07:48.490]
And you know something?

[02:07:48.830 --> 02:07:50.630]
If there are people in the organization who like it?

[02:07:50.870 --> 02:07:52.310]
Today, that's what I say about that.

[02:07:53.550 --> 02:07:54.970]
Because I'm thinking they're going to go like it.

[02:07:54.970 --> 02:07:56.990]
They're going to win about five or six games this season, Chris.

[02:07:57.150 --> 02:07:57.690]
That's what I'm saying.

[02:07:57.810 --> 02:07:59.650]
I don't want to get you all bummed out, but that's what I'm thinking.

[02:07:59.890 --> 02:08:01.410]
I'm thinking about seven to eight.

[02:08:01.530 --> 02:08:01.810]
Ooh!

[02:08:02.830 --> 02:08:03.470]
The Optimist.

[02:08:03.590 --> 02:08:04.790]
I'm thinking five or six.

[02:08:06.690 --> 02:08:07.090]
943.

[02:08:07.610 --> 02:08:11.410]
If Marlon Brando hadn't played Don Cualione in the Godfather,

[02:08:11.790 --> 02:08:14.310]
which of these other actors who were considered for the role?

[02:08:14.530 --> 02:08:15.350]
That's the important thing.

[02:08:15.650 --> 02:08:19.390]
Not just some schlepper who happens to be big and fat or play in mob movies.

[02:08:19.830 --> 02:08:22.550]
Which of these other guys who were considered for the role would you prefer?

[02:08:24.810 --> 02:08:25.210]
356.

[02:08:25.370 --> 02:08:26.370]
Ain't nobody else could have done it.

[02:08:26.470 --> 02:08:29.370]
Thank God I put that on there because unfortunately Charlie B,

[02:08:29.510 --> 02:08:31.030]
who's suffering from a serious problem.

[02:08:31.350 --> 02:08:32.170]
I have no life.

[02:08:32.170 --> 02:08:33.590]
I went and left that off.

[02:08:33.790 --> 02:08:34.730]
I mean, that's obvious.

[02:08:35.210 --> 02:08:35.770]
Isn't it?

[02:08:36.750 --> 02:08:37.370]
It is.

[02:08:37.830 --> 02:08:39.050]
Nobody else could have done it.

[02:08:40.050 --> 02:08:40.490]
356.

[02:08:40.930 --> 02:08:41.950]
Anthony Quinn 250.

[02:08:42.170 --> 02:08:42.890]
I'm on Merv Griffin.

[02:08:43.190 --> 02:08:43.610]
Oh, I'm sorry.

[02:08:44.330 --> 02:08:46.090]
Well, the day isn't complete without mentioning him.

[02:08:46.130 --> 02:08:48.550]
And there's that fat ball-headed Bob Murray from the energy thing.

[02:08:48.650 --> 02:08:49.590]
We really don't know.

[02:08:49.930 --> 02:08:52.550]
And I wouldn't read too much into it yet.

[02:08:52.950 --> 02:08:53.690]
But it is hope.

[02:08:54.090 --> 02:08:54.670]
It is hope.

[02:08:55.670 --> 02:08:59.170]
Yeah, they heard those scraping scratching sounds down there in the amine.

[02:08:59.170 --> 02:08:59.430]
Yeah.

[02:09:01.690 --> 02:09:03.770]
331 points on the downside on the dial right now.

[02:09:03.810 --> 02:09:05.430]
Things aren't looking good for all you people who were saying,

[02:09:05.550 --> 02:09:06.370]
oh boy, near the use.

[02:09:06.590 --> 02:09:07.910]
You shouldn't have got out of the market yet.

[02:09:08.070 --> 02:09:08.430]
Screw you.

[02:09:08.910 --> 02:09:09.510]
Screw you.

[02:09:09.670 --> 02:09:11.170]
A fool in his money is soon farted, baby.

[02:09:11.330 --> 02:09:12.170]
I don't want no part of it.

[02:09:12.410 --> 02:09:13.070]
I don't want to see it.

[02:09:13.190 --> 02:09:13.930]
I don't want to smell it.

[02:09:14.190 --> 02:09:14.970]
I don't want to know from it.

[02:09:15.010 --> 02:09:16.250]
It's a scam for rich people.

[02:09:16.370 --> 02:09:17.050]
That's what it's all about.

[02:09:17.350 --> 02:09:19.850]
It's a scam for the wealthiest, like everything else is.

[02:09:20.830 --> 02:09:23.350]
Well, there's the pictures of those six guys resting peace, you know.

[02:09:26.310 --> 02:09:31.170]
They said they heard banging on the pipes, banging and clinging on the pipe.

[02:09:31.630 --> 02:09:33.150]
I'm not going to make any jokes about it because I would know.

[02:09:33.150 --> 02:09:34.550]
No, in fact, I'm not even playing that.

[02:09:34.630 --> 02:09:35.610]
It doesn't make fun of me.

[02:09:36.170 --> 02:09:36.350]
Why?

[02:09:36.750 --> 02:09:37.490]
There's nothing funny about it.

[02:09:37.490 --> 02:09:38.570]
There's nothing funny about it.

[02:09:38.570 --> 02:09:41.650]
This guy's getting trapped in a mine and going to die or maybe already did die.

[02:09:44.110 --> 02:09:45.110]
Anthony Quinn 250.

[02:09:45.610 --> 02:09:47.350]
He just buries the competition.

[02:09:48.090 --> 02:09:51.850]
George C. Scott 83, or some Wells 55 because he was big and fat.

[02:09:51.850 --> 02:09:54.250]
Frank Sinatra 47 because he was a Mopster.

[02:09:55.790 --> 02:09:57.990]
That would be a good poll question for you next week.

[02:09:58.290 --> 02:10:00.530]
Which would you rather be a Mopster or a lobster?

[02:10:01.290 --> 02:10:02.550]
Well, it depends on which family.

[02:10:03.350 --> 02:10:04.670]
Edwards E. Robinson 44.

[02:10:04.830 --> 02:10:08.330]
Ernest Borgmine 37, which to me is so still, that would be like saying Carl Molden.

[02:10:08.550 --> 02:10:09.990]
How about Ken Molden?

[02:10:10.090 --> 02:10:11.010]
How's Ken doing, by the way?

[02:10:11.130 --> 02:10:11.450]
He's great.

[02:10:12.090 --> 02:10:12.290]
Good.

[02:10:13.830 --> 02:10:15.050]
Give him a big kiss for me.

[02:10:15.590 --> 02:10:15.730]
I will.

[02:10:16.390 --> 02:10:17.530]
Burline Castor 21.

[02:10:17.990 --> 02:10:19.430]
Lawrence Salivier 19.

[02:10:19.930 --> 02:10:20.970]
Danny Thomas 19.

[02:10:20.970 --> 02:10:23.170]
Danny Thomas was considered for the role.

[02:10:25.390 --> 02:10:27.030]
Danny Thomas is the Godfather.

[02:10:27.190 --> 02:10:28.030]
I would have been funny.

[02:10:28.350 --> 02:10:28.790]
Wow.

[02:10:29.270 --> 02:10:29.990]
Well, that's not.

[02:10:30.670 --> 02:10:33.330]
And Carl O'Pante, who was once married to Sophia Loren.

[02:10:34.470 --> 02:10:34.650]
12.

[02:10:34.830 --> 02:10:36.370]
We know where his nose spent a lot of time.

[02:10:37.010 --> 02:10:38.210]
So the reason for the dropouts?

[02:10:38.590 --> 02:10:38.970]
Yes.

[02:10:39.650 --> 02:10:40.610]
Windows was updating.

[02:10:43.430 --> 02:10:44.550]
What does that mean?

[02:10:45.210 --> 02:10:45.830]
No T-M-D-O.

[02:10:46.010 --> 02:10:46.690]
What did I say to that man?

[02:10:46.890 --> 02:10:50.010]
We run it through our computer over here to connect to the server.

[02:10:50.430 --> 02:10:53.250]
And I guess that computer decided that I was going to update Windows.

[02:10:53.510 --> 02:10:54.690]
So I had to turn on and off and off.

[02:10:56.530 --> 02:10:57.730]
That's what I'm being told by engineering.

[02:10:58.470 --> 02:10:59.050]
Well, good.

[02:10:59.210 --> 02:11:01.230]
At least it stopped turning on and off and on.

[02:11:01.490 --> 02:11:02.290]
I mean, 130.

[02:11:02.570 --> 02:11:03.650]
To go from 0 to 130.

[02:11:03.650 --> 02:11:05.510]
And I'll even my vet doesn't do it that fast.

[02:11:06.890 --> 02:11:07.710]
It was scary.

[02:11:09.750 --> 02:11:10.830]
948 votes on the poll.

[02:11:10.950 --> 02:11:11.870]
I'm one of the worst polls.

[02:11:11.870 --> 02:11:13.250]
And again, I apologize for it.

[02:11:13.270 --> 02:11:13.890]
That's probably...

[02:11:13.890 --> 02:11:15.250]
Oh, here's a little note.

[02:11:15.730 --> 02:11:18.930]
You know, the guy who just has the palm tree and calls himself Miami.

[02:11:18.930 --> 02:11:20.230]
On the Myspace website.

[02:11:21.270 --> 02:11:21.590]
Yeah.

[02:11:22.110 --> 02:11:24.810]
Well, you don't because you don't go on there, do you?

[02:11:25.170 --> 02:11:25.770]
No, it's all over here.

[02:11:25.770 --> 02:11:26.570]
Do you ever look at that?

[02:11:27.010 --> 02:11:27.870]
Is it at your site?

[02:11:28.610 --> 02:11:29.790]
And at the show site?

[02:11:31.230 --> 02:11:31.550]
No.

[02:11:34.470 --> 02:11:37.030]
So in other words, you just got your own private little thing going there.

[02:11:37.150 --> 02:11:39.130]
You got to the Z-Man, my former friend Zisco,

[02:11:39.130 --> 02:11:40.790]
who I used to love dearly and madly.

[02:11:40.910 --> 02:11:41.990]
And I still do, but he's...

[02:11:41.990 --> 02:11:42.070]
Right.

[02:11:42.750 --> 02:11:43.830]
He sent me a nice man.

[02:11:43.970 --> 02:11:44.650]
The only person I talked to was...

[02:11:44.650 --> 02:11:45.550]
I said I like to read the better.

[02:11:47.690 --> 02:11:48.890]
He didn't say that enough.

[02:11:49.230 --> 02:11:49.830]
He said he's the best.

[02:11:50.170 --> 02:11:51.050]
Very funny video.

[02:11:51.050 --> 02:11:53.430]
But now that you handed him the tickets, I think you're getting printed for it.

[02:11:53.490 --> 02:11:54.250]
Because he just...

[02:11:54.250 --> 02:11:56.530]
He didn't give me a total shine today, but pretty close to it.

[02:11:56.990 --> 02:11:57.590]
Six words.

[02:11:57.750 --> 02:11:57.890]
What?

[02:11:59.130 --> 02:12:00.550]
You're going to make him feel bad now.

[02:12:01.170 --> 02:12:01.950]
That's the idea.

[02:12:03.230 --> 02:12:05.310]
That's the idea to make him feel real bad.

[02:12:05.510 --> 02:12:07.350]
He's not going to do that, but a little bit guilty.

[02:12:07.570 --> 02:12:08.090]
And I like...

[02:12:08.090 --> 02:12:10.450]
Like I said, don't underdo it, okay?

[02:12:10.850 --> 02:12:12.330]
Because I let you off the hook for old times.

[02:12:12.330 --> 02:12:15.490]
Don't get carried away because I'm a sensitive old slob, you know?

[02:12:15.710 --> 02:12:16.070]
Old queen.

[02:12:16.330 --> 02:12:19.830]
But anyway, he writes here this palm tree guy, whoever he is, Mr. Anonymous.

[02:12:20.650 --> 02:12:22.070]
He says, hey, Neil, don't be insulted.

[02:12:22.270 --> 02:12:22.830]
That's a certificate.

[02:12:23.010 --> 02:12:24.130]
We're didn't sell that fast.

[02:12:24.290 --> 02:12:26.990]
This restaurant just opened last month, so nobody knows about it yet.

[02:12:27.230 --> 02:12:28.630]
It does look good though, he says.

[02:12:29.430 --> 02:12:31.850]
Also, I think that your deals are in brow with so much faster.

[02:12:32.110 --> 02:12:34.050]
Because that's where most of your audience probably is in...

[02:12:34.050 --> 02:12:34.310]
What?

[02:12:34.810 --> 02:12:35.530]
Yeah, well, that's true.

[02:12:35.690 --> 02:12:36.390]
But this is...

[02:12:36.390 --> 02:12:38.130]
I mean, this is an easy location, you know?

[02:12:38.770 --> 02:12:40.450]
And you guys were raving about the food.

[02:12:40.450 --> 02:12:41.950]
George said it was the best steak he ever had.

[02:12:42.270 --> 02:12:43.550]
That's a good point though, that it's just opened.

[02:12:43.650 --> 02:12:46.790]
A lot of the places that sell out quicker already, you know, people know about them.

[02:12:47.050 --> 02:12:47.710]
People know about them.

[02:12:47.850 --> 02:12:48.970]
They know, hey, this is a great place.

[02:12:49.110 --> 02:12:51.110]
Let's grab this up and say, you know, have price.

[02:12:51.430 --> 02:12:52.270]
So, I'm worried.

[02:12:52.590 --> 02:12:54.350]
So, in other words, they're not taking your word for it.

[02:12:55.730 --> 02:12:56.930]
Take their word for it.

[02:12:57.350 --> 02:12:58.870]
Bacon is thick as your hand.

[02:13:00.010 --> 02:13:01.770]
And the steak, juicy and delish.

[02:13:03.290 --> 02:13:05.530]
Mmm, good enough for a swish.

[02:13:07.010 --> 02:13:08.190]
9.51 in a pool.

[02:13:08.190 --> 02:13:10.430]
And the crisis, you didn't think we could do it, did you?

[02:13:10.730 --> 02:13:11.190]
Oh, it's different.

[02:13:11.370 --> 02:13:11.370]

[02:13:11.490 --> 02:13:12.070]
Around 600.

[02:13:13.030 --> 02:13:17.490]
And on the 16th of August, when everybody is like out of town, if they have any possibility of getting out of that...

[02:13:17.490 --> 02:13:20.190]
Out of that outdoor assess pool...

[02:13:20.810 --> 02:13:23.610]
Neil, it sounds to me like you're pretty negative about South Florida.

[02:13:23.830 --> 02:13:24.610]
How'd you guess that?

[02:13:25.230 --> 02:13:26.610]
Boy, you're really a quick man.

[02:13:26.730 --> 02:13:27.430]
Quick on the uptake.

[02:13:27.690 --> 02:13:29.570]
I'm not just a little bit sour on South Florida.

[02:13:29.750 --> 02:13:31.090]
I'm definitely on it.

[02:13:32.650 --> 02:13:34.710]
And the dollar's down 333 points.

[02:13:34.850 --> 02:13:35.850]
What's this breaking money?

[02:13:36.330 --> 02:13:37.270]
I think that's...

[02:13:37.270 --> 02:13:38.170]
I think that's true, or they had the earthquake.

[02:13:39.110 --> 02:13:40.630]
300 and some people are dead there.

[02:13:40.950 --> 02:13:42.230]
The Lord works in mysterious ways.

[02:13:42.410 --> 02:13:44.930]
And like I said, Jimmy DeRandy is not singing Inca Dink of Duane.

[02:13:44.930 --> 02:13:46.250]
Why don't you pick on the Indian so bad?

[02:13:47.310 --> 02:13:47.770]
What do I?

[02:13:48.250 --> 02:13:49.310]
I like the Indians, they're great.

[02:13:50.970 --> 02:13:52.470]
The ones that speak English anyway.

[02:13:52.950 --> 02:13:55.830]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

[02:13:56.330 --> 02:13:57.670]
Okay, we'll take your word for it.

[02:13:59.690 --> 02:14:00.770]
9.51 on there.

[02:14:00.890 --> 02:14:02.110]
We got the thing sold out now.

[02:14:02.210 --> 02:14:03.310]
Right, Chris, better take a look at it.

[02:14:03.310 --> 02:14:07.310]
No, sorry, I don't want to leave here today at two o'clock and then find out that, you know,

[02:14:07.390 --> 02:14:09.930]
somebody comes out of the tea room with just his thing in his hand.

[02:14:10.010 --> 02:14:11.790]
It was with an extra certificate in his hand.

[02:14:12.210 --> 02:14:13.590]
I want to make sure it's sold.

[02:14:13.970 --> 02:14:15.930]
I don't want it, I still gots performance today.

[02:14:16.050 --> 02:14:17.070]
Drink it, baby.

[02:14:18.430 --> 02:14:21.370]
5-religious better than your religion.

[02:14:21.450 --> 02:14:21.910]
Oh, right.

[02:14:22.010 --> 02:14:24.390]
5-religious better than yours.

[02:14:25.470 --> 02:14:28.950]
5-religious, you want to require two avoidable and a lame of fire.

[02:14:29.190 --> 02:14:31.230]
5-religious, better than yours.

[02:14:31.690 --> 02:14:31.810]
Huh?

[02:14:31.810 --> 02:14:35.510]
5-religious better than your religion.

[02:14:35.790 --> 02:14:38.310]
5-religious better than yours.

[02:14:38.750 --> 02:14:42.890]
While 5-religious and amortates business tree and racial hate.

[02:14:43.250 --> 02:14:45.250]
5-religious, better than yours.

[02:14:46.210 --> 02:14:48.650]
5-religious, better than yours.

[02:14:49.930 --> 02:14:52.030]
5-religious, better than yours.

[02:14:52.990 --> 02:14:59.130]
What we like about a best-knife-on-go-boys is where address 5-religious, better than yours.

[02:15:00.250 --> 02:15:02.630]
Why religion is better than religion?

[02:15:03.790 --> 02:15:05.650]
Why religion is better than religion?

[02:15:05.750 --> 02:15:05.750]

[02:15:06.210 --> 02:15:07.350]
Why religion is better than religion?

[02:15:07.370 --> 02:15:11.410]
We have no reason to call it a driven driver cap to make a living pie

[02:15:11.410 --> 02:15:12.910]
Because it's better than religion.

[02:15:14.210 --> 02:15:16.290]
And my religion is better than religion.

[02:15:17.790 --> 02:15:19.750]
And my religion is better than religion.

[02:15:21.510 --> 02:15:23.350]
Jupa harbors, mookie ghosts,

[02:15:23.470 --> 02:15:25.030]
We slaughter pigs and dogs and goats.

[02:15:25.330 --> 02:15:26.930]
My religion is better than religion.

[02:15:26.930 --> 02:15:30.570]
J Denise, my religion is better than religion.

[02:15:32.030 --> 02:15:34.110]
My religion is better than religion.

[02:15:34.110 --> 02:15:39.270]
J Denise, She is my religion is better than religion.

[02:15:41.990 --> 02:15:48.150]
My religion is better than religion.

[02:15:49.030 --> 02:15:52.330]
We have to change the language of religion quite a required language advantage.

[02:15:52.330 --> 02:15:52.410]
You are the most—

[02:15:52.410 --> 02:15:55.730]
I'm religion is better than religion and I laugh hard

[02:15:55.730 --> 02:15:55.850]
You are also the strongest in school.

[02:15:56.790 --> 02:15:56.830]
You are the strongest.

[02:15:56.830 --> 02:16:02.950]
My religion's better than your religion My religion's better than your horrors

[02:16:03.890 --> 02:16:09.650]
We wear ties and ride our bikes and gets you married lots of wives My religion's better than yours

[02:16:10.670 --> 02:16:16.650]
My religion's better than your religion My religion's better than yours

[02:16:17.530 --> 02:16:21.310]
We don't want to use our brains for mindless whaling, don't per�

[02:16:21.310 --> 02:16:23.730]
My religion's better than yours

[02:16:23.730 --> 02:16:23.930]
Our world seems to own life

[02:16:26.990 --> 02:16:29.890]
Pure KFw is today

[02:16:35.070 --> 02:16:35.730]
Theanyakites

[02:16:38.070 --> 02:16:38.110]
Hmm

[02:16:40.070 --> 02:16:41.770]
Sarah's baby, that's why it's about

[02:16:41.770 --> 02:16:42.950]
I give you

[02:16:43.730 --> 02:16:45.330]
Fine, yours reader

[02:16:45.730 --> 02:16:50.450]
It's really hard if we run so hard.

[02:16:50.450 --> 02:16:53.830]
You know, really when you stop seriously, I don't want to get to serious because it's not serious.

[02:16:54.010 --> 02:16:57.290]
But when you stop and think about all these idiots who are like schlepping there to Graceland

[02:16:57.290 --> 02:17:02.590]
and standing on line and the old lady that died from the heat, from heat prostration,

[02:17:02.710 --> 02:17:03.450]
whatever it doesn't want to be.

[02:17:03.650 --> 02:17:03.970]
Yeah.

[02:17:05.830 --> 02:17:07.290]
I mean, what are we talking about?

[02:17:07.490 --> 02:17:07.790]
You know what I mean?

[02:17:07.790 --> 02:17:08.350]
You know what I mean?

[02:17:08.350 --> 02:17:09.250]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

[02:17:09.250 --> 02:17:09.510]
like that.

[02:17:09.690 --> 02:17:11.410]
So many crazy people in so little time.

[02:17:13.030 --> 02:17:14.210]
They're schlepping to Graceland.

[02:17:15.050 --> 02:17:16.810]
What are Paul Simon's going, you think?

[02:17:18.790 --> 02:17:19.190]
Yeah.

[02:17:22.750 --> 02:17:24.870]
961, Simon says, don't go there.

[02:17:25.750 --> 02:17:28.570]
Well, here's an update on the Michael Vick thing because I know what could be more important

[02:17:28.570 --> 02:17:29.930]
than it's got to do with sports, baby.

[02:17:29.990 --> 02:17:34.930]
It's got to do with ball games and the pig skin and illiterate jocks and criminal jocks.

[02:17:35.250 --> 02:17:39.130]
Michael Vick is considering joining the two coderfendants who will ask a judge tomorrow

[02:17:39.130 --> 02:17:42.310]
to sign off on their P agreements in that federal dog fighting case.

[02:17:43.030 --> 02:17:46.570]
The deal offered by federal prosecutors recommends that the Atlanta Falcons quarterback

[02:17:46.570 --> 02:17:51.390]
serve a year in prison, the Virginian pilot reported in his Thursday editions, the newspaper

[02:17:51.390 --> 02:17:52.750]
quotes two anonymous sources.

[02:17:53.830 --> 02:17:57.230]
Without an agreement in place by the end of the week, Vick could face new, more serious

[02:17:57.230 --> 02:17:59.870]
charges when the grand jury reconvenes on Monday.

[02:18:00.650 --> 02:18:04.690]
The Atlantic Ural Constitution quoted sources saying Vick is waiting to hear from how, from

[02:18:04.690 --> 02:18:07.270]
the NFL how a guilty plea might affect his football career.

[02:18:07.930 --> 02:18:11.210]
If he doesn't agree to it, the other newspaper reported that Vick could be charged with racketeering

[02:18:11.210 --> 02:18:13.750]
in a super-seeking indictment.

[02:18:13.810 --> 02:18:17.550]
By the way, a nice deal by the Panthers in the training wave Bobby DeWongo and getting

[02:18:17.550 --> 02:18:21.830]
Alex Old couldn't stop a bowling ball and Todd Bertuzzi, how many games did he play?

[02:18:22.030 --> 02:18:24.470]
Anyway, speaking of, hey, don't forget Brian Allen.

[02:18:25.810 --> 02:18:27.070]
I'll get to Brian Allen.

[02:18:27.450 --> 02:18:28.790]
What do you want with Brian Allen?

[02:18:29.290 --> 02:18:30.810]
Well, he least was one good pick up in that deal.

[02:18:33.610 --> 02:18:35.050]
What are you talking about?

[02:18:36.970 --> 02:18:38.650]
Do you have any idea what you're talking about?

[02:18:38.910 --> 02:18:40.210]
They got hockey fans.

[02:18:40.210 --> 02:18:41.310]
Yeah, of course.

[02:18:41.710 --> 02:18:42.390]
You're an idiot.

[02:18:44.130 --> 02:18:47.910]
You would know Maurice Rechard from Richard the Turd.

[02:18:47.910 --> 02:18:49.350]
It's because they were dead before I was left.

[02:18:49.710 --> 02:18:50.270]
That's true.

[02:18:51.470 --> 02:18:52.570]
That's not true at all.

[02:18:53.470 --> 02:18:56.190]
The rocket and the pocket rocket, Henri Rechard and Danny Gallivan.

[02:18:56.510 --> 02:18:59.530]
Let's get hockey intense and that'll blow off whatever little audience we got left here

[02:18:59.530 --> 02:19:00.130]
on QAAM.

[02:19:00.490 --> 02:19:04.010]
And you know something now that I think about it, as much as we're going to miss that

[02:19:04.610 --> 02:19:05.410]
spooky voice.

[02:19:05.410 --> 02:19:09.330]
This defense and is a bill only to play with better players is the only to think the

[02:19:09.330 --> 02:19:09.590]
game.

[02:19:09.950 --> 02:19:11.170]
There's Matt Stagen, baby.

[02:19:11.250 --> 02:19:11.890]
Number 14.

[02:19:12.070 --> 02:19:13.090]
Why didn't they retire that number?

[02:19:13.170 --> 02:19:14.890]
How could Davey Keyon's number not be retired?

[02:19:14.890 --> 02:19:21.090]
But anyway, now that Kelly is gone, who's the hockey expert in our sports system?

[02:19:21.670 --> 02:19:21.750]
You.

[02:19:22.530 --> 02:19:23.750]
I don't do a sports show.

[02:19:23.850 --> 02:19:24.550]
I'm not talking hockey.

[02:19:24.870 --> 02:19:26.570]
George talked me off of that a long time ago.

[02:19:28.250 --> 02:19:30.410]
Who are we going to, who's going to be the maven on that?

[02:19:30.630 --> 02:19:32.610]
Of course, we don't carry the Panther games anymore.

[02:19:34.010 --> 02:19:36.510]
There's only home game, a 10 game stretch.

[02:19:36.730 --> 02:19:41.170]
In fact, this weekend when Toronto plays at Madison Square Garden, that would be the

[02:19:41.170 --> 02:19:45.130]
main police, 2015 of the year, 17, no, there's anybody here, huh?

[02:19:45.510 --> 02:19:47.130]
What's that got to do with the Panthers anyway?

[02:19:47.890 --> 02:19:49.030]
Here's some more hockey stuff.

[02:19:49.390 --> 02:19:54.190]
Henri, Henri and Shaper, back in sports with the pocket, they're doing a noble job.

[02:19:55.050 --> 02:19:56.890]
Under there, sharp angle, sharp.

[02:19:57.830 --> 02:20:01.170]
There was one thing when you see the word puck like a thousand times during a hockey game

[02:20:01.170 --> 02:20:02.010]
during the course of the game.

[02:20:02.010 --> 02:20:04.370]
Isn't it amazing that these guys don't ever slip?

[02:20:04.630 --> 02:20:06.650]
Or at least I never heard any of them say, you know what I'm saying?

[02:20:07.110 --> 02:20:07.670]
What he said.

[02:20:08.750 --> 02:20:14.610]
I'm saying that it's just a very strange word and it's got some risks involved.

[02:20:14.890 --> 02:20:15.530]
Well, I hear everything else.

[02:20:15.810 --> 02:20:17.650]
Anyway, speaking of which, let's get back to Michael Vick.

[02:20:18.930 --> 02:20:22.070]
If Vick doesn't agree to deal with the other newspaper, says Vick could be charged with

[02:20:22.070 --> 02:20:23.790]
a racketeering and a superseding indictment.

[02:20:24.170 --> 02:20:26.790]
Co-offentant's Prinnell P.35 and Queeness Phillips.

[02:20:27.350 --> 02:20:29.990]
Queeness rhymes with Anis, who was very famous.

[02:20:29.990 --> 02:20:31.750]
Remember famous Anis and a chocolate chip cookies?

[02:20:32.150 --> 02:20:33.310]
Well, he came in really one bag.

[02:20:34.450 --> 02:20:35.750]
Those things are addictive.

[02:20:35.970 --> 02:20:36.910]
They should be outlawed.

[02:20:37.610 --> 02:20:39.870]
They're doing court tomorrow to seek approval for their P.D.O.s.

[02:20:40.170 --> 02:20:42.310]
A third co-offentant Tony Taylor, 34th-P.D.

[02:20:42.390 --> 02:20:43.290]
Gilly, July 30th.

[02:20:43.490 --> 02:20:44.750]
A great cooperate with prosecutors.

[02:20:45.190 --> 02:20:47.150]
This leads only Vick to negotiate for a deal.

[02:20:47.690 --> 02:20:49.010]
He wants Monty Hall to come down.

[02:20:50.370 --> 02:20:52.170]
Well, there's that bald-headed guy from the mine again.

[02:20:52.330 --> 02:20:54.470]
He's, what is that that they're looking at?

[02:20:57.430 --> 02:20:58.330]
Looks like a water.

[02:20:58.330 --> 02:21:00.890]
Yeah, what's all that water pushing inside the mine there?

[02:21:00.970 --> 02:21:01.590]
What is that?

[02:21:01.790 --> 02:21:02.410]
Yeah, water.

[02:21:02.850 --> 02:21:03.930]
Here we go, flood the mine.

[02:21:03.970 --> 02:21:05.910]
Maybe it's Kentucky Ring, all of this is in Utah.

[02:21:06.590 --> 02:21:08.650]
When asked about the possibility of negotiating for a deal,

[02:21:08.770 --> 02:21:12.430]
Vick spoke first in Colin Spencer, the turd told CNN,

[02:21:12.790 --> 02:21:13.990]
nothing's been decided yet.

[02:21:15.570 --> 02:21:17.190]
He pleaded not guilty in July.

[02:21:17.410 --> 02:21:18.690]
After a federal grand jury leds the organized,

[02:21:18.990 --> 02:21:20.910]
bloody and vicious dog fight center Virginia property

[02:21:20.910 --> 02:21:21.890]
brought in 2001.

[02:21:22.390 --> 02:21:24.110]
He's also accused of transporting and delivering dogs

[02:21:24.110 --> 02:21:24.990]
across state lines.

[02:21:25.550 --> 02:21:27.390]
I want to case earlier this year, he participated

[02:21:27.390 --> 02:21:29.370]
in killing eight dogs prosecutors.

[02:21:29.590 --> 02:21:31.070]
I think they just sort of kill him.

[02:21:31.150 --> 02:21:32.170]
That would be a good amount.

[02:21:32.310 --> 02:21:33.230]
I mean, he's not worth eight dogs.

[02:21:33.330 --> 02:21:35.570]
He's not even worth one because he hasn't gone dog,

[02:21:35.790 --> 02:21:37.050]
you know, like that, right?

[02:21:37.950 --> 02:21:38.110]
Right.

[02:21:38.630 --> 02:21:40.570]
He's an idiot and a butcher.

[02:21:41.810 --> 02:21:43.470]
And when somebody is making that kind of money,

[02:21:43.610 --> 02:21:45.170]
you know, and they have to resort to stuff like that,

[02:21:45.350 --> 02:21:47.510]
they've got a very serious, how do we put it?

[02:21:47.590 --> 02:21:49.590]
Very serious social problems.

[02:21:49.790 --> 02:21:50.690]
Is that a good way to put it?

[02:21:51.210 --> 02:21:52.530]
Sure, that's a nice use for me.

[02:21:53.450 --> 02:21:55.270]
What is this thing we're looking at there?

[02:21:55.390 --> 02:21:55.970]
What is it?

[02:21:55.970 --> 02:21:57.710]
It's a mind-camder.

[02:21:58.290 --> 02:21:58.350]
Huh?

[02:21:58.710 --> 02:21:59.690]
Yeah, that's the mind-cam.

[02:22:01.210 --> 02:22:02.330]
The mind-cam?

[02:22:02.630 --> 02:22:03.830]
And it's mind-time.

[02:22:04.070 --> 02:22:05.270]
There was a very dynamic checkpoint.

[02:22:05.490 --> 02:22:07.570]
The current video was taken in a number two borehole.

[02:22:07.670 --> 02:22:08.370]
Number two borehole.

[02:22:08.490 --> 02:22:09.010]
Number two?

[02:22:09.190 --> 02:22:09.350]
Yes.

[02:22:09.750 --> 02:22:11.030]
Yeah, let's take a lot of water.

[02:22:11.930 --> 02:22:12.930]
Yeah, listen, a lot of water.

[02:22:12.930 --> 02:22:14.330]
Where's that water coming down the borehole?

[02:22:15.210 --> 02:22:17.350]
Coming down the borehole, mind-there's a lot of holes there,

[02:22:17.430 --> 02:22:17.830]
you know what I'm saying?

[02:22:18.310 --> 02:22:20.710]
I told you the other day, which hole is the biggest problem.

[02:22:21.510 --> 02:22:22.710]
But I'm not going to say it again.

[02:22:23.510 --> 02:22:24.250]
You butcher ass.

[02:22:26.170 --> 02:22:27.170]
964 holes on the pool.

[02:22:27.290 --> 02:22:28.290]
I mean, these guys have got to be.

[02:22:28.310 --> 02:22:29.350]
It's like 11th day now.

[02:22:29.570 --> 02:22:30.970]
There is no chance of that.

[02:22:30.990 --> 02:22:34.070]
No water, no food, no nothing, you know.

[02:22:34.230 --> 02:22:35.530]
Plus minimal oxygen.

[02:22:35.870 --> 02:22:35.930]
Sure.

[02:22:36.730 --> 02:22:38.950]
But this at least it's something for the TV networks

[02:22:38.950 --> 02:22:39.730]
to put on there, though.

[02:22:40.210 --> 02:22:42.010]
The mind-hunter is showing video from a camera

[02:22:42.010 --> 02:22:43.310]
sent through the mind into the hole.

[02:22:43.970 --> 02:22:45.110]
They're looking through that hole.

[02:22:45.450 --> 02:22:46.950]
And they don't hear no sound.

[02:22:47.110 --> 02:22:47.990]
They don't see no body.

[02:22:49.030 --> 02:22:51.030]
Now, the one good thing is they don't smell, you know,

[02:22:51.130 --> 02:22:53.310]
if six guys died down there, probably wouldn't smell too good,

[02:22:53.310 --> 02:22:53.510]
right?

[02:22:54.950 --> 02:22:55.330]
Geez.

[02:22:56.270 --> 02:22:56.650]
What?

[02:22:57.050 --> 02:22:57.750]
Of all things.

[02:22:58.630 --> 02:22:58.830]
Yeah.

[02:23:04.010 --> 02:23:05.170]
Anyway, 964 votes.

[02:23:05.910 --> 02:23:08.210]
I'm not going to read the result of the pool's 2D pressing.

[02:23:13.130 --> 02:23:13.890]
567-0560.

[02:23:14.010 --> 02:23:15.530]
I'm going to take a little bit of call here right now.

[02:23:16.530 --> 02:23:16.710]
All right.

[02:23:16.990 --> 02:23:17.770]
Let me play the piano.

[02:23:19.170 --> 02:23:19.170]

[02:23:20.330 --> 02:23:20.730]
Yes, sir.

[02:23:21.130 --> 02:23:21.770]
What's up, dog?

[02:23:22.330 --> 02:23:23.050]
How are you doing, Pellet?

[02:23:24.290 --> 02:23:26.710]
I say we get some professional ping pong players

[02:23:26.710 --> 02:23:29.910]
to play some ping pong with Michael Vicks' co-honest.

[02:23:30.790 --> 02:23:31.950]
Yeah, that sounds a good idea.

[02:23:32.490 --> 02:23:32.670]
Yeah.

[02:23:33.090 --> 02:23:35.450]
This is freaking knock those damn things out of his body.

[02:23:35.570 --> 02:23:35.870]
OK.

[02:23:36.650 --> 02:23:37.750]
OK, WQI and Hello.

[02:23:38.410 --> 02:23:41.310]
I'm worrying nothing but a red condom in my work truck.

[02:23:42.270 --> 02:23:42.590]
OK.

[02:23:43.350 --> 02:23:43.430]
OK.

[02:23:44.370 --> 02:23:44.510]
OK.

[02:23:44.510 --> 02:23:45.270]
WQI and Hello.

[02:23:45.790 --> 02:23:48.070]
Neil, about a year ago, my girlfriend forced me

[02:23:48.070 --> 02:23:49.510]
to go to Grace Lane because we were in Memphis.

[02:23:50.030 --> 02:23:51.190]
Oh, I'm so sorry.

[02:23:51.190 --> 02:23:52.050]
Oh, it was the worst.

[02:23:52.190 --> 02:23:53.990]
But the funniest thing was somebody in front of me

[02:23:53.990 --> 02:23:56.690]
who was going through the house was looking at these things

[02:23:56.690 --> 02:23:59.630]
like they were looking at the most amazing epithetism.

[02:23:59.890 --> 02:24:00.210]
Wow.

[02:24:00.910 --> 02:24:02.830]
Look at these albums and I'm just staring at them.

[02:24:02.930 --> 02:24:04.650]
And they look like they came right out of deliverance

[02:24:04.650 --> 02:24:05.050]
to these guys.

[02:24:05.910 --> 02:24:06.950]
I have never seen.

[02:24:07.310 --> 02:24:08.510]
It was probably the most boring to ours.

[02:24:08.650 --> 02:24:09.890]
I almost killed myself in that place.

[02:24:10.390 --> 02:24:11.470]
And people paid big bucks for that.

[02:24:11.970 --> 02:24:12.730]
Do they really?

[02:24:13.030 --> 02:24:13.750]
It's terrible.

[02:24:14.150 --> 02:24:14.990]
And people are starving.

[02:24:16.590 --> 02:24:17.670]
I've really wanted to kill her.

[02:24:17.710 --> 02:24:19.350]
I think I broke up with the girl right after that

[02:24:19.350 --> 02:24:20.190]
because it was perhaps the worst.

[02:24:20.190 --> 02:24:21.390]
It sounds like a good move.

[02:24:21.610 --> 02:24:22.470]
OK, don't do it again, pal.

[02:24:23.450 --> 02:24:24.170]
WQI and Hello.

[02:24:24.870 --> 02:24:25.750]
Hey, Neil, what's going on, buddy?

[02:24:26.130 --> 02:24:26.670]
How you doing, sir?

[02:24:27.330 --> 02:24:29.810]
Hey, anybody call you and let you know about Lucy Lopez

[02:24:29.810 --> 02:24:32.430]
laughing about your son's turn inside the, you know what?

[02:24:33.290 --> 02:24:35.210]
That was our first appearance like a month and a half ago.

[02:24:35.570 --> 02:24:35.710]
Yeah.

[02:24:36.050 --> 02:24:37.670]
Just checking, but OK.

[02:24:37.970 --> 02:24:38.190]
Thanks.

[02:24:39.270 --> 02:24:40.950]
I've always been very concerned about that.

[02:24:41.770 --> 02:24:42.410]
WQI and Hello.

[02:24:44.370 --> 02:24:45.130]
QA and Hello.

[02:24:46.050 --> 02:24:46.410]
Neil.

[02:24:46.910 --> 02:24:47.230]
Yes, sir.

[02:24:47.230 --> 02:24:50.590]
You were talking about Graceland, but aren't you

[02:24:50.590 --> 02:24:52.790]
worried that when you die, your house is going to become

[02:24:52.790 --> 02:24:53.490]
like Graceland?

[02:24:53.850 --> 02:24:54.130]
No.

[02:24:55.450 --> 02:24:58.070]
Because there's going to be lots of fans flocking out.

[02:24:58.070 --> 02:25:00.070]
Yeah, it's going to be greaselies.

[02:25:00.210 --> 02:25:00.750]
Sealing fans.

[02:25:01.130 --> 02:25:02.010]
Somebody QA and Hello.

[02:25:02.290 --> 02:25:03.230]
Happy birthday, sweetheart.

[02:25:04.090 --> 02:25:04.710]
Oh, boy.

[02:25:05.610 --> 02:25:07.390]
Like I said, little furry every now and then,

[02:25:07.390 --> 02:25:09.190]
we have 965 votes on the poll, which

[02:25:09.190 --> 02:25:10.550]
means we'll make the thousand easy.

[02:25:10.550 --> 02:25:11.210]
Trust me.

[02:25:11.510 --> 02:25:12.370]
Oh, God.

[02:25:13.510 --> 02:25:16.490]
Tonight, on fashion cops, the ministry

[02:25:16.490 --> 02:25:20.010]
of un-Islamic dress is patrolling the streets of Tehran.

[02:25:20.290 --> 02:25:23.630]
We are responding to a 410 female with a loose headscarf.

[02:25:24.110 --> 02:25:25.230]
All the right dead.

[02:25:25.710 --> 02:25:26.950]
Hence what I cannot see them.

[02:25:27.190 --> 02:25:27.470]
Oh, no.

[02:25:27.610 --> 02:25:28.210]
What is this about?

[02:25:28.530 --> 02:25:30.110]
Why are your ears exposed?

[02:25:30.690 --> 02:25:31.910]
The wind must have blown my scarf.

[02:25:32.130 --> 02:25:32.730]
Yeah, yeah.

[02:25:32.910 --> 02:25:34.090]
That's all the Ayatollah.

[02:25:34.190 --> 02:25:34.650]
Let's go.

[02:25:34.930 --> 02:25:38.290]
Making sure the streets I say from dangerous curves

[02:25:38.290 --> 02:25:41.830]
and Western style haircuts is the job of the brave man

[02:25:41.830 --> 02:25:44.290]
and women of fashion cops Tehran.

[02:25:44.290 --> 02:25:47.810]
We are approaching the trailer path, where a man is apparently

[02:25:47.810 --> 02:25:50.290]
using product, possibly hair gel.

[02:25:50.690 --> 02:25:52.750]
He has considered cropped and dangerous.

[02:25:53.190 --> 02:25:53.590]
Hey, buddy.

[02:25:53.990 --> 02:25:54.290]
Hey, buddy.

[02:25:54.710 --> 02:25:55.930]
What is in your pocket, huh?

[02:25:56.250 --> 02:25:56.590]
Nothing.

[02:25:57.010 --> 02:25:57.670]
Let me see.

[02:25:58.210 --> 02:26:00.190]
Are too much deep in the dough.

[02:26:00.390 --> 02:26:01.550]
It's not mine.

[02:26:01.910 --> 02:26:04.170]
A friend asked me to hold it for you.

[02:26:04.310 --> 02:26:06.370]
Who is your friend, Divinila Heiss?

[02:26:06.590 --> 02:26:11.030]
You are going away for a long time, Mr. Fashioned cops Tehran.

[02:26:11.750 --> 02:26:14.350]
All suspects are considered guilty until proven innocence.

[02:26:16.810 --> 02:26:20.270]
OK, 130 at 5.60 W.D. Q.A. and local and federal agencies

[02:26:20.270 --> 02:26:22.750]
ever have vastly expanded access to information gathered

[02:26:22.750 --> 02:26:25.250]
from spy satellites in the US going to the Wall Street Journal.

[02:26:25.890 --> 02:26:27.390]
They're going to be spying on you.

[02:26:29.430 --> 02:26:30.170]
You like it?

[02:26:30.710 --> 02:26:31.510]
I don't like it.

[02:26:32.250 --> 02:26:33.010]
You like it?

[02:26:33.430 --> 02:26:33.850]
No.

[02:26:34.010 --> 02:26:34.090]
No.

[02:26:35.590 --> 02:26:36.630]
You better watch it.

[02:26:36.670 --> 02:26:38.010]
I'm going to crank up again.

[02:26:38.190 --> 02:26:38.570]
Oh, boy.

[02:26:39.930 --> 02:26:40.490]
Crankhead.

[02:26:43.550 --> 02:26:46.170]
Information from some of the US's most powerful intelligence

[02:26:46.170 --> 02:26:52.750]
gathering tools will soon be at the disposal of a wide

[02:26:52.750 --> 02:26:54.810]
array of law enforcement agencies and all levels of government

[02:26:54.810 --> 02:26:56.650]
reports Robert Block in the journal today.

[02:26:57.330 --> 02:26:59.390]
Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell decided

[02:26:59.390 --> 02:27:01.750]
to increase access to the spy data earlier this year

[02:27:01.750 --> 02:27:04.350]
and ask Homeland Security Secretary Michael Churdov

[02:27:04.350 --> 02:27:06.230]
to facilitate access to the spy data

[02:27:06.230 --> 02:27:07.790]
by civilian agencies and law enforcement.

[02:27:08.650 --> 02:27:11.690]
Previously access to only the most basic spy satellite data

[02:27:11.690 --> 02:27:13.650]
was limited to a handful of federal civilian agencies,

[02:27:13.950 --> 02:27:16.030]
such as NASA and the US Geological Survey,

[02:27:16.410 --> 02:27:18.670]
which used the images for a scientific and environmental study.

[02:27:19.390 --> 02:27:21.630]
The move to turn spy satellites on American citizens

[02:27:21.630 --> 02:27:24.510]
raises the legal questions because the use of such data

[02:27:24.510 --> 02:27:26.970]
for law enforcement is largely uncharted territory.

[02:27:27.530 --> 02:27:29.070]
Even the officials behind the move were

[02:27:29.070 --> 02:27:31.150]
unsure of its legal implications the journal would be saying.

[02:27:31.890 --> 02:27:33.510]
There was little of any policy guidance

[02:27:33.510 --> 02:27:35.030]
or procedures regarding the collection,

[02:27:35.030 --> 02:27:38.010]
exploitation and dissemination of domestic information

[02:27:38.010 --> 02:27:41.450]
to the 2005 study from the US intelligence community,

[02:27:41.890 --> 02:27:43.890]
which recommended access to spy satellites.

[02:27:44.290 --> 02:27:47.070]
M-A-S-I-N-T, Masonth, or Measurement and Simultures Intelligence,

[02:27:47.430 --> 02:27:49.210]
is a special kind of spy satellite data

[02:27:49.210 --> 02:27:51.690]
that would become available to law enforcement for the first time.

[02:27:52.790 --> 02:27:54.570]
According to defense experts, the journal reports

[02:27:54.570 --> 02:27:56.870]
Mason uses radar and lasers infrared,

[02:27:57.210 --> 02:27:58.790]
electromagnetic data and other technologies

[02:27:58.790 --> 02:28:00.910]
to see through cloud cover, force canopies,

[02:28:01.050 --> 02:28:02.970]
and even concrete to create images together data.

[02:28:03.650 --> 02:28:05.310]
The full capabilities of these systems

[02:28:05.310 --> 02:28:07.070]
are unknown outside the intelligence community

[02:28:07.070 --> 02:28:08.970]
because they're among the most closely held secrets

[02:28:08.970 --> 02:28:10.050]
and government block rights.

[02:28:10.310 --> 02:28:12.870]
Some civil liberties activists were that without proper oversight.

[02:28:13.210 --> 02:28:15.010]
Only those inside national application office

[02:28:15.010 --> 02:28:16.450]
will know what's being monitored from space.

[02:28:16.870 --> 02:28:17.670]
They're watching you, baby.

[02:28:17.970 --> 02:28:18.630]
They're looking at you.

[02:28:19.030 --> 02:28:20.210]
Brian Allen, my ass.

[02:28:22.030 --> 02:28:23.390]
971 votes on the pool, you know.

[02:28:23.810 --> 02:28:25.410]
I was taken it for granted and see,

[02:28:25.470 --> 02:28:26.770]
this is the bad mistake that I make.

[02:28:26.870 --> 02:28:28.270]
Have I told you this Chris a million times?

[02:28:28.630 --> 02:28:29.550]
You'll never take it for granted?

[02:28:29.790 --> 02:28:30.030]
Of course.

[02:28:31.250 --> 02:28:33.910]
We need 29 votes in 28 minutes, which granted,

[02:28:34.030 --> 02:28:34.830]
that's only one a minute.

[02:28:35.930 --> 02:28:37.250]
But I don't want to take it for granted

[02:28:37.250 --> 02:28:38.690]
because it would be a real blow.

[02:28:38.910 --> 02:28:39.950]
You know, after we had that difficulty

[02:28:39.950 --> 02:28:41.590]
in selling those certificates for prime,

[02:28:41.710 --> 02:28:43.450]
what is it, prime blue grill?

[02:28:45.190 --> 02:28:47.110]
974, 26 votes, 27 minutes.

[02:28:47.270 --> 02:28:48.330]
I mean, you people can do it.

[02:28:50.190 --> 02:28:54.190]
But I'm just a little bit, you know, a little concerned.

[02:28:55.190 --> 02:28:56.390]
Are you concerned George?

[02:28:56.950 --> 02:28:57.470]
No. No.

[02:28:57.470 --> 02:28:57.530]
No.

[02:28:59.010 --> 02:29:00.310]
So the food was great, huh?

[02:29:00.910 --> 02:29:02.270]
It's a lot ofacular, excellent.

[02:29:03.210 --> 02:29:03.410]
Good.

[02:29:04.270 --> 02:29:05.990]
See, that's one of the one of the friends benefits.

[02:29:06.150 --> 02:29:07.550]
This is the only reason that George and Chris

[02:29:07.550 --> 02:29:09.590]
can both afford to work at QAIM is because

[02:29:09.590 --> 02:29:10.750]
of the free lunches every day.

[02:29:12.330 --> 02:29:13.870]
If it weren't for that, probably George

[02:29:13.870 --> 02:29:15.910]
would have to sell his remaining gray hairs

[02:29:15.910 --> 02:29:18.890]
and Chris would have to sell his fat.

[02:29:19.890 --> 02:29:22.050]
If he could get paid by the pound, that'd be rich.

[02:29:23.250 --> 02:29:24.950]
State Senator Bob Allen was removed

[02:29:24.950 --> 02:29:26.330]
from his committee assignments yesterday

[02:29:26.330 --> 02:29:29.030]
by House Speaker Marco Rubio, who said his fellow Republican

[02:29:29.030 --> 02:29:31.510]
can no longer effectively represent his constituents

[02:29:31.510 --> 02:29:33.550]
while they faces a prostitution charge.

[02:29:34.130 --> 02:29:35.530]
Allen, Republican and Merritt Island,

[02:29:35.670 --> 02:29:37.170]
was charged with misdemeanor solicitation

[02:29:37.170 --> 02:29:40.470]
for prostitution after allegedly offering an undercover officer

[02:29:40.470 --> 02:29:42.610]
20 bucks to perform oral sexual eye

[02:29:42.610 --> 02:29:44.410]
on a Thursday, Titusville Parkpoly said.

[02:29:45.330 --> 02:29:47.190]
Rubio said in the statement that the House will respect

[02:29:47.190 --> 02:29:49.090]
Allen's right to defend himself against the charge,

[02:29:49.470 --> 02:29:51.690]
but that public officials are judged by a higher standard

[02:29:51.690 --> 02:29:52.470]
than other citizens.

[02:29:52.870 --> 02:29:54.470]
The speaker removed Allen from the Energy Committee,

[02:29:54.470 --> 02:29:56.910]
which he had cheered, and the Environment National Resources

[02:29:56.910 --> 02:29:57.430]
Council.

[02:29:58.610 --> 02:30:01.390]
There's nothing we like better than self-hating,

[02:30:01.810 --> 02:30:03.990]
phony baloney, hypocritical, right-wing Republicans,

[02:30:04.390 --> 02:30:06.090]
getting caught with their pantaloonies down.

[02:30:07.250 --> 02:30:08.610]
Hang down your head, Tom Dooley.

[02:30:09.250 --> 02:30:10.830]
The mere presumption of impropriety can interfere

[02:30:10.830 --> 02:30:12.390]
with our official function, Rubio said.

[02:30:12.750 --> 02:30:14.990]
It's my personal belief that because the allegations against

[02:30:14.990 --> 02:30:17.290]
him, representative Allen can no longer effectively serve

[02:30:17.290 --> 02:30:18.790]
the people to his district in the Florida House.

[02:30:19.250 --> 02:30:21.050]
Allen 40, it's said he respected Rubio's right

[02:30:21.050 --> 02:30:23.230]
to make committee changes, but that's the speaker's comments

[02:30:23.230 --> 02:30:25.030]
insinuating they already been proven guilty.

[02:30:25.670 --> 02:30:27.170]
There's political pressure at work here.

[02:30:27.190 --> 02:30:28.830]
He said, I haven't had my first day in court yet.

[02:30:29.590 --> 02:30:31.250]
The representative again denied the charge,

[02:30:31.470 --> 02:30:33.290]
termed him it's preventive from seeking the election of the House,

[02:30:33.610 --> 02:30:35.730]
but he said he still find it around for the state Senate.

[02:30:36.770 --> 02:30:39.550]
Governor Charlie Christ, yay, defended Rubio's move earlier today.

[02:30:40.210 --> 02:30:41.730]
I have to respect the wishes of the speaker.

[02:30:41.850 --> 02:30:44.010]
He said it's a house issue, and the speaker is trying to do

[02:30:44.010 --> 02:30:45.030]
what's best for the body.

[02:30:46.250 --> 02:30:48.010]
Don't you always want to do what's best for the body?

[02:30:50.650 --> 02:30:51.630]
I'm doing it right now.

[02:30:51.630 --> 02:30:53.650]
That's what, maybe that's what Allen was trying to do in the

[02:30:53.650 --> 02:30:55.290]
park. They're doing what was best for his body.

[02:30:55.810 --> 02:30:57.890]
980 votes, we need 20 more boys and girls.

[02:30:58.310 --> 02:30:59.190]
Pile on it, baby.

[02:30:59.750 --> 02:31:01.010]
Hop on there and do it.

[02:31:02.570 --> 02:31:04.450]
While Rubio stopped sure to mess me on the resign,

[02:31:04.910 --> 02:31:06.650]
civil rights groups have called from the equipment because of

[02:31:06.650 --> 02:31:09.790]
racially tinge comments he allegedly made to police after his arrest.

[02:31:10.690 --> 02:31:13.510]
An audio tip indicates he told Titusville assistant police chief

[02:31:13.510 --> 02:31:16.690]
John Lowe that he felt intimidated by a stocky black guy in the

[02:31:16.690 --> 02:31:19.110]
park's restroom and taught the man and under cover officer

[02:31:19.110 --> 02:31:21.110]
and other stocky black guys were going to rob him.

[02:31:21.990 --> 02:31:23.850]
Allen also told Lowe the officer first mentioned

[02:31:23.850 --> 02:31:26.250]
a real sex for money, and then he simply went along with discussing

[02:31:26.250 --> 02:31:28.190]
the transaction and avoided becoming a statistic.

[02:31:29.070 --> 02:31:31.970]
The lawmakers have been meeting with the NAACP to explain his remarks,

[02:31:32.150 --> 02:31:34.150]
saying they were out of character and taking out a context.

[02:31:35.210 --> 02:31:36.850]
Allen said he had no media plans to resign,

[02:31:36.950 --> 02:31:37.770]
we left the door open.

[02:31:38.250 --> 02:31:39.970]
I think he probably does all the time,

[02:31:40.050 --> 02:31:43.010]
especially in the tea room, you know, like come on in,

[02:31:43.130 --> 02:31:44.130]
let's have a party.

[02:31:45.030 --> 02:31:47.350]
If this thing became protracted and we were long legal battle,

[02:31:47.350 --> 02:31:50.050]
and that would be the time to evaluate one of my time would be best spent

[02:31:50.050 --> 02:31:51.810]
being a legislator, he said, or not.

[02:31:52.050 --> 02:31:52.610]
I think or not.

[02:31:53.470 --> 02:31:55.910]
Probably sounds good. I wonder how Miss Foley is doing, by the way.

[02:31:55.950 --> 02:31:56.290]
Remember her?

[02:31:57.230 --> 02:31:57.630]
Sure I did.

[02:31:58.050 --> 02:32:01.590]
We don't hear no mo, no mo gay about Miss Foley, which is sad.

[02:32:04.010 --> 02:32:06.530]
984 votes, we need 16 in 24 minutes.

[02:32:06.650 --> 02:32:07.830]
If we can't do that, then we're just,

[02:32:08.070 --> 02:32:09.470]
we're shutting the show off, okay?

[02:32:09.790 --> 02:32:11.490]
Permanently, if we can't get to 1000 today.

[02:32:12.810 --> 02:32:13.730]
Would you go along with that?

[02:32:14.510 --> 02:32:14.830]
Okay.

[02:32:14.830 --> 02:32:16.390]
We're shutting the baby down.

[02:32:16.670 --> 02:32:18.730]
We need 16 more votes in 24 minutes.

[02:32:19.350 --> 02:32:21.830]
And I realize it's kind of, I don't know, it's kind of a strange day today.

[02:32:22.530 --> 02:32:25.790]
I feel like I'm getting a real shine routine from a lot of people, but you know what?

[02:32:26.870 --> 02:32:27.130]
What?

[02:32:27.270 --> 02:32:31.250]
I'm not going to be some drama queen and take it off personally and get all emotional and upset about it.

[02:32:32.010 --> 02:32:32.290]
Good.

[02:32:33.190 --> 02:32:34.470]
I'm just going to plot right along.

[02:32:34.590 --> 02:32:36.550]
Here's the facts from Roscoe.

[02:32:36.610 --> 02:32:37.350]
Roscoe Pico.

[02:32:39.250 --> 02:32:40.350]
Trey, take a, huh?

[02:32:42.510 --> 02:32:43.130]
Roscoe Pico.

[02:32:44.030 --> 02:32:44.130]
Roscoe Pico.

[02:32:44.130 --> 02:32:48.290]
Good to hear your voice, but I must say George is cutting out to be a good host himself, cutting out.

[02:32:48.810 --> 02:32:51.330]
I enjoy hearing about his roller skating mishaps and Christra.

[02:32:51.410 --> 02:32:53.170]
I'm just going to like the good punk producer we need to be.

[02:32:54.170 --> 02:32:56.010]
Well, isn't that good? That's what we want you to say.

[02:32:56.190 --> 02:32:59.350]
I must say your rights are for this full of inconsiderate pigs.

[02:32:59.970 --> 02:33:04.030]
My apartment building alone, every day people leave their boogers by the buttons to push for each floor.

[02:33:04.670 --> 02:33:05.730]
At least they're leaving you something.

[02:33:06.070 --> 02:33:07.370]
Maybe they're leaving you a little snack.

[02:33:07.370 --> 02:33:11.410]
Well, now they've hardened up and all the blind people in my building keep going to the wrong floors.

[02:33:12.530 --> 02:33:13.710]
It says, Roscoe up.

[02:33:13.810 --> 02:33:14.170]
Are they funny?

[02:33:15.410 --> 02:33:16.750]
That hysterical, that'll app right?

[02:33:18.010 --> 02:33:21.210]
All the people who are going to the blind people keep going to the wrong floors.

[02:33:23.190 --> 02:33:25.210]
984, click that baby before we do the break.

[02:33:27.990 --> 02:33:31.030]
Oh, we should hope that you'll become a night reporter too to learn how to just go to CNN.

[02:33:31.270 --> 02:33:32.830]
Isn't that what that's a cure for this man?

[02:33:32.830 --> 02:33:37.210]
I despise her. I wish an evil. She ought to be in the same plane with that Tony Harris guy.

[02:33:37.670 --> 02:33:41.830]
987, we think need 13 more votes in 22 minutes. Otherwise, finito.

[02:33:42.310 --> 02:33:44.430]
Holy cow, errands coming.

[02:33:45.330 --> 02:33:46.510]
I bet you were wondering.

[02:33:47.310 --> 02:33:47.610]
Yeah!

[02:33:49.190 --> 02:33:50.250]
98 on the pole.

[02:34:03.650 --> 02:34:32.810]

[02:36:32.470 --> 02:36:33.730]
I'm getting sick, yeah.

[02:36:37.090 --> 02:37:00.310]
Okay, so you're going to be the od y'all, the 123 point winner after you beat that huge

[02:37:00.310 --> 02:37:05.010]
We got our thousand votes one oh oh one we got a thousand and one see I've thrown to Chris you have little faith

[02:37:05.010 --> 02:37:07.290]
Yes, you did I'm sorry. I told you a long time

[02:37:07.290 --> 02:37:11.810]
I if I would have just told you like 20 minutes ago wouldn't have been no big to do you know and of course

[02:37:11.810 --> 02:37:13.930]
It still is no big to do but to me it is

[02:37:14.590 --> 02:37:18.550]
To me it is yeah, right since working chip I beg your pardon. That's what's important

[02:37:19.090 --> 02:37:24.230]
What happened to George it? You passed out about here? Oh, I thought maybe passed out from the pain from a thriving pain

[02:37:25.730 --> 02:37:29.850]
See young says the brain behind bushes brain rove was just a ruse

[02:37:30.830 --> 02:37:35.670]
Reading the urologies to Carl spend more time at home with my family though my kids have already left home rove

[02:37:35.670 --> 02:37:43.710]
Both pro and con fiction and reality I've come to the conclusion that there be more diabolical explanations than meets the eye regarding who is really behind George's W

[02:37:43.710 --> 02:37:45.930]
Bush's success or a staying power

[02:37:46.630 --> 02:37:50.550]
Most every son of a gun who was swept in with a 2000 Gore plurality is gone

[02:37:50.550 --> 02:37:56.970]
Rumsfeld gone O'Neill gone ascrop gone wolf a wits promoted then gone tenant metal or freedom

[02:37:56.970 --> 02:38:03.470]
Paul humiliated liby pardoned now rove who's left Alberto Gonzalez is he still there seriously? I don't recall

[02:38:04.150 --> 02:38:07.130]
Kindle these are rights to brain two words Cal Ripken

[02:38:07.830 --> 02:38:10.630]
naming a former baseball players an ambassador maybe kind of cool

[02:38:10.630 --> 02:38:15.030]
But the on the same day over 200 people were blown up in Iraq two more words bad timing

[02:38:15.670 --> 02:38:17.410]
It would be easy to pin this on chaney

[02:38:17.410 --> 02:38:22.830]
But any sleuth and training would see the chaney is only red herring yes a smallly scarlet fish but not the brain

[02:38:22.830 --> 02:38:26.910]
House mart is a guy who shoots his best friend in the face and waits today to tell anybody

[02:38:26.910 --> 02:38:29.130]
It's not the purple gets off who's the genius

[02:38:29.130 --> 02:38:35.130]
It's the virtuoso who gets the lead scoundrel off who's the genius not OJ which any cockron not Bill O'Reilly

[02:38:35.130 --> 02:38:41.710]
But the faxler who made out of court deal that made sexual harassment charges go away no not the prince but Nicolo D

[02:38:42.170 --> 02:38:42.610]
Macchiabelli

[02:38:43.910 --> 02:38:51.290]
Even Lucian Goldberg pride enjoyed Jonas certainly not your standard road critic in his homage to the leader department Carl so that Bush's brain had overstate his

[02:38:51.290 --> 02:38:53.110]
Way past his success years

[02:38:53.110 --> 02:38:56.010]
Stereverly refused to depart to see not a historic high note

[02:38:56.010 --> 02:39:00.470]
So a call wasn't smart enough to leave on the high note and was pushed out and every other possibility

[02:39:00.470 --> 02:39:05.790]
Doesn't seem to be qualified who is the real brain behind the brain behind the brain as in any good story

[02:39:05.790 --> 02:39:11.990]
It's the one you least suspect and in this white house story the guilty party is wait for it wait for it

[02:39:12.530 --> 02:39:13.670]
George W. Bush

[02:39:14.650 --> 02:39:20.390]
Yes, sir the fool who became the man who in his own words can barely speak English the man who nearly everyone this side of shan

[02:39:20.390 --> 02:39:27.750]
Hannity thinks he is where he is because of those clever enough to elect trancey gardener prison is the mastermind of the perhaps greatest caper ever pulled on the electorate

[02:39:28.270 --> 02:39:30.870]
Oh, you can prove who if you want mr. Watson for follow me here

[02:39:30.870 --> 02:39:33.630]
I realize the first thing you'll see is nobody could be that stupid

[02:39:34.570 --> 02:39:38.250]
That's the same thing they say about comedian Paulie sure

[02:39:38.870 --> 02:39:44.350]
But it wasn't sure who is stupid it was his audience and the industry and it took plenty of movies and

[02:39:44.850 --> 02:39:48.270]
Millions before they figured out that Paulie wasn't funny or counted in any way

[02:39:48.270 --> 02:39:50.490]
But stupid who's the one I walked away with a big box

[02:39:51.150 --> 02:39:57.770]
Even the family guys Peter Griffin as soon as stupid as he may seem has hit hit show and maybe the sexiest cartoon life on TV

[02:39:58.530 --> 02:40:07.850]
Bush is just another Paulie sure Peter Griffin only what he's been able to sell his result in getting hundreds of thousands killed and millions displaced in an uncalled invasion of a country who didn't attack us

[02:40:07.850 --> 02:40:13.490]
Placed as trillions in debt left an entire state to drown while in his spare time sort of a constitution in its freedoms

[02:40:14.730 --> 02:40:17.430]
Failures all in his popularity is suffered, but who's gotten the blame?

[02:40:17.590 --> 02:40:22.030]
You didn't see Bush throwing out of office during Katrina. No, it was a perfectly place scapegoat Michael Brown

[02:40:23.030 --> 02:40:26.270]
Think Bush didn't know what he was doing when he pulled Browning. He was doing a heck of a job

[02:40:26.270 --> 02:40:30.870]
Think keeping Gonzalez on the job long enough to get through the elicit political prosecutor firing is dumb

[02:40:31.410 --> 02:40:35.910]
Not when you have a ever-loral fall guy well in place see my dear Watson. It's quite elementary

[02:40:35.910 --> 02:40:40.130]
Ask yourself who's the dummy who's the genius who's lost their jobs and who stays on

[02:40:40.130 --> 02:40:45.530]
Gone are so many of the so-called geniuses who Bush was calling after position as his print at his personal White House

[02:40:45.530 --> 02:40:49.410]
Moat and yet while Robe is gone and Paulie sure is left to run his mom's comedy club

[02:40:49.410 --> 02:40:53.570]
George W. Bush remains in power and that ladies and gentlemen is genius pure

[02:40:54.090 --> 02:40:56.270]
Moniacle genius right Steve young

[02:40:56.830 --> 02:41:00.450]
Ever see Paulie sure and George wish together same guy good point

[02:41:02.930 --> 02:41:04.830]
We had a thousand six votes

[02:41:06.290 --> 02:41:08.530]
I think you ought to be pretty pleased with me today

[02:41:10.890 --> 02:41:11.330]
I

[02:41:11.330 --> 02:41:11.490]
Am

[02:41:12.370 --> 02:41:21.830]
Cloud is much we managed to sell those 50 certificates for prime blue girl see I think that the Miami tree guy whoever that palm tree guy is I think he made a good point

[02:41:22.630 --> 02:41:26.650]
And that is it's a new place very few people have heard of it very even fewer have eaten there

[02:41:26.650 --> 02:41:32.170]
And as a result they don't know a you know and you you guys went on raving about the great stake in the thick bacon

[02:41:32.170 --> 02:41:36.390]
How delicious everything was and those crispy little pizza stuff these people just you know

[02:41:36.930 --> 02:41:40.470]
They got to start taking our word a little bit more or not as the case maybe do what you like

[02:41:40.470 --> 02:41:44.550]
You know you're only you're only shooting yourselves in the feet if you pass up a good deal like that

[02:41:45.230 --> 02:41:46.470]
So I'm telling you right now

[02:41:48.210 --> 02:41:53.230]
Now I would I never tell you what to do on the show on the pool anything else. Do I?

[02:41:54.170 --> 02:41:54.570]
Not often

[02:41:57.230 --> 02:41:57.990]
Not often

[02:41:58.670 --> 02:42:01.950]
I ever tell you what to give me a hard time about this pole business, you know

[02:42:01.950 --> 02:42:04.850]
It's like like I take the pole seriously

[02:42:04.850 --> 02:42:06.750]
No, I didn't say that. I'm not taking this seriously

[02:42:09.490 --> 02:42:13.990]
Even though we like Charlie be a lot and we appreciate the fact that he has no life and his whole life is

[02:42:13.990 --> 02:42:15.830]
Senator around sitting as a bunch of pools

[02:42:16.450 --> 02:42:21.370]
Keep it up Charlie what keep it up Charlie. Yeah, keep it up Charlie. Please pretty please

[02:42:21.830 --> 02:42:26.250]
I would definitely pass on the other godfather ones you know about Tom Hagen and about Michael

[02:42:26.890 --> 02:42:29.610]
Corleone I mean, you know, I'm not telling you what to do

[02:42:31.010 --> 02:42:33.990]
Because I only did this one in a moment of weakness. I don't know why right now

[02:42:34.950 --> 02:42:39.890]
Yesterday I thought to myself on a master's day. I got to work and that means right now at about three 34 o'clock

[02:42:39.890 --> 02:42:42.910]
I got to send in a pool to Fed Eric and

[02:42:42.910 --> 02:42:47.510]
So what was sitting on the top of the pile if Marlon Brando hadn't played on veto Corleone in the godfather

[02:42:47.510 --> 02:42:50.530]
Which of these other actors who were all considered for the role would you prefer?

[02:42:51.170 --> 02:42:56.450]
And I thought to myself well, this is this is shooting myself in the foot because there's no way we'll get a thousand votes on this baby

[02:42:57.590 --> 02:43:01.810]
And we get a thousand seven and we still got like eight eight minutes and twenty seconds, but who's counting

[02:43:02.590 --> 02:43:06.850]
Nobody else could have done it see if I wouldn't have put that on there. I think we'd have sucked wind

[02:43:08.410 --> 02:43:14.790]
Nobody else could have done it 377 over 37% other than Marlon and you know as Merff Griffin got more

[02:43:14.790 --> 02:43:21.650]
Kudos when he died than Marlon Brando. Don't you agree? All right, who is more important in show business Merff Griffin or Marlon Brando

[02:43:23.250 --> 02:43:26.310]
Who made more great movies Merff Griffin or Marlon Brando

[02:43:26.310 --> 02:43:30.010]
Who is bad? Who is the biggest fag anyway?

[02:43:30.010 --> 02:43:33.430]
Anthony Quinn 264 he buries everybody else

[02:43:34.090 --> 02:43:41.730]
George C Scott 88 or something else 57 Frank's not for 50 people with a really good sense of humor every G Robinson 45

[02:43:42.650 --> 02:43:43.850]
Jim neighbors don't have any

[02:43:44.650 --> 02:43:48.610]
Ernest Borgbein 40 Danny Thomas 34. I still I'm still trying to picture that

[02:43:49.210 --> 02:43:55.770]
The lesbian ease of godfather for Lancaster 22 Lawrence Olivier 19 and Carl O'Pompe 12

[02:43:56.950 --> 02:44:01.950]
And let me see it again his claim to fame. He was once married to Sophia Loren and what did you tell me about the great movie?

[02:44:02.190 --> 02:44:06.250]
He made he was in you directly what it wasn't I don't like to eat that or whatever. I don't see me

[02:44:06.250 --> 02:44:08.750]
Was it I don't know and something like that

[02:44:09.690 --> 02:44:14.150]
Well, we want to apologize for being here today all of us on the show because obviously we got a very important

[02:44:14.150 --> 02:44:19.230]
Exhibitionist game that often's in Kansas City later on and you know for us to stick in here for four hours of

[02:44:19.230 --> 02:44:20.530]
non sports non football

[02:44:20.530 --> 02:44:22.730]
Crap we apologize profusely

[02:44:31.390 --> 02:44:31.870]

[02:44:34.670 --> 02:44:38.990]
Is she really trying to help him and take away well there she is let's ask her

[02:44:38.990 --> 02:44:46.890]
Betty is that the dawn's ringer where she must be great to meet him is he picking you off after moss today by the way

[02:44:53.250 --> 02:44:53.730]
We're

[02:44:53.730 --> 02:45:03.170]
It's not

[02:45:03.170 --> 02:45:14.010]
He came

[02:45:23.750 --> 02:45:27.910]
Never shake the shower, a change to towel

[02:45:27.910 --> 02:45:32.970]
That's why I fell for the rubber rack

[02:45:36.010 --> 02:45:40.890]
One day my dad's dead by someone new

[02:45:43.730 --> 02:45:48.870]
I had to tell my dad where the blue is

[02:45:48.870 --> 02:45:51.050]
I'd better go find somebody new

[02:45:51.830 --> 02:45:56.810]
I told him I couldn't wait for him to go ahead

[02:45:56.810 --> 02:45:59.250]
And bump who waits

[02:45:59.970 --> 02:46:02.150]
That's when he shot me

[02:46:02.150 --> 02:46:03.590]
The leader of the rag

[02:46:04.730 --> 02:46:07.010]
There's no doubt about the death

[02:46:07.010 --> 02:46:08.550]
No one

[02:46:21.270 --> 02:46:24.450]
Let's abuse some more prisoners

[02:46:24.450 --> 02:46:27.630]
Make them scream nice and loud

[02:46:27.630 --> 02:46:28.970]
I'll be going to rape you

[02:46:28.970 --> 02:46:32.030]
Get me some wires and a battery pack

[02:46:32.030 --> 02:46:32.330]
Oh!

[02:46:32.750 --> 02:46:35.650]
I don't care if they ain't from my rack

[02:46:35.650 --> 02:46:39.150]
To be used, used to the torture

[02:46:39.870 --> 02:46:42.610]
Cause they're just playing their game

[02:46:42.610 --> 02:46:44.150]
In the past

[02:46:44.870 --> 02:46:47.990]
It had to be worse with the dumb

[02:46:47.990 --> 02:46:49.750]
Who say?

[02:46:50.550 --> 02:46:51.270]
Bye, bye, bye!
