Oh come loves the aeush as long as men have been

[00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.940]
The cars we've never been sure of their

[00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.160]
And these things in drunken herl and chunks will laugh it all away

[00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.800]
But you can't be a you should your gay

[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.120]

I don't know what I'm trying to say you can't be

[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.200]
Any a saint patty's day parade if you're some screaming flaming fag. That's what I'm trying to tell you

[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.440]
This has Timmy hardaway. He'll tell you know Timmy good old Timmy. He may I hate gay people

[00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.400]
He wore a jockstrap old Timmy, you know, this is the jockstrap station, baby

[00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.780]
I was trying to print out the thing that very jackass wrote this morning about how QA must have been very intensive

[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.960]
Disgressions to try to get the dolphin broadcast back and of course the ticket is still you know trying to

[00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.820]
Hang on they're squeezing it. Well, it's hope they do and Mr

[00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.000]
Of systemry maddets says he wants to be back on the broadcast if we get the games. Oh right

[00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.140]
Nothing I mean there's nothing really and I don't think Jim Sarni writes a regular column for the Sun sent no anymore

[00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.260]
If you google Jim Sarni on a sent cell website it says what?

[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.580]
What who yeah

[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.300]
And then you tell me I want to find out what he wrote and they'll say

[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.800]
Well, anybody want to know what that old toad wrote but in any rate

[00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:15.440]
It's a Friday nothing wrong with that March 16th and we're all saying panties that we survived the eyes of March yesterday

[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:23.280]
Nothing really special happened nobody got nobody got knife. I guess today nobody I know stabbed stabbed in the back probably somebody did somewhere but

[00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:32.060]
A lot of that stuff going on going on here the drilling yeah, I do I was just gonna ask you what's all that racket vibrating it

[00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.340]
I don't know what they're telling us man. I thought it was college hoops. We got tennis going on

[00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.100]
Maybe we got a real racket a Q.I.M. Which of course that's what I got a real racket

[00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.680]
Anyway, here's the poll from yesterday. Well, I'll tell you

[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.780]
Charlie B. Oh first I got to tell Chris. They're happy 30th birthday Chris somebody on the

[00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.200]
Myspace want to meet a wish it's not the Chris you know or I know but it's some

[00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:59.340]
And also they want to be say hey Chris you're fair like that see how I have bled we have 268 friends in Myspace

[00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.700]
I have a little advice by the way about Myspace a little a little bit. You know what I mean? Yeah

[00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.780]
Well, it knows if it all depends on what you're doing on there if you're just dealing around that's fine

[00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.020]
If you're looking to like meet somebody to make a friend or an acquaintance or like get late or something like that

[00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:18.780]
If the other person on there is evasive and doesn't want to give you very much information like even the

[00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.920]
Town that they live in or much less like a last name or a phone number something like that

[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.280]
I would just take it with a green assault and probably like delete them immediately. You know if they don't want to uh

[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.960]
That that's just my suggestion

[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.040]
You know what I'm saying what do you say?

[00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.480]
Because they're just too many a it's an anonymous thing. It's an anonymous

[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:35.740]
Who's

[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.880]
Makes people are forthcoming anyone to give you like a real name and this and that that's anyway Charlie B

[00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.180]
He was very apologetic

[00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:44.140]
Yeah

[00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.060]
This is a good pull somebody said and this is great

[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.000]
But what are you apologizing child? So some of your pull suck? That's okay. A lot of our pull suck too

[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.500]
We're getting paid to do this stuff

[00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:59.020]
So just because the one yesterday was weak. I mean we did wind up with the whole bunch of votes. How many like um, let's see

[00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:00.500]
1400 all right

[00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.800]
Today's pull is terrible to a court of the audience. I think today's pull is fine

[00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:10.420]
And yet I hate this pull is when the hands down your pants. It's not even close way out in front of all the rest

[00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.500]
I hate this pull because the flow is just full of hate and you know what I understand

[00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:20.800]
If you're trapped in a outdoor septic tank and outdoor assess pool like stuff, but in actually you're probably going to be a little more

[00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:23.820]
Hostile than the run of the mill schmuck running around on the loose

[00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:29.860]
This is a good pull somebody said in this one might be good for uh front for uh what what day is it for over the weekend?

[00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.180]
Well, no, don't tell me that this other one is gonna stay up all the way over the weekend

[00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:39.720]
See I get ahead of myself on these now. I realize the one that's on it right now is the Friday pull it stays up there through the weekend

[00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.320]
I might change this on I don't know

[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.900]
Sooner sooner rather than later

[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.240]
When Neil show ends early because of marlin's baseball I

[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:53.600]
Listen every second of the baseball broadcast smash my radio with a hammer sitting in dark room and pout

[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:58.240]
Taking that because I'm usually exhausted after Neil show anyway. Play my best in the LCDs

[00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.360]
Switch to the sports hole station across the street work on my fantasy league roster

[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.900]
Pray that the marlin's via slow painful death listen to rush listen to magic listen to power

[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.820]
Turn off my radio until it's time for Neil's next show or read the bible there you go

[00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:15.960]
Pray for us to come back when that marlin game comes on man

[00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:20.660]
Well, you know what I haven't gotten any assistance on because I'm trying to get some Chicago tourist information

[00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:25.360]
Here for a friend of mine who's making this first trip. I haven't been there in about 400 years. I love Chicago

[00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:26.200]
It's a great city

[00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:30.200]
But the pizza I asked this the other day and the pizza thing. I'm not getting any uh

[00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.220]
Yeah, I mean you can go online and I've done that

[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:36.360]
And you can read all those reviews, but I'd like to you know hear from like the living and breathing person

[00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.820]
Maybe a fax would be good. Okay. Maybe we'll get some calls. I you know, I have no

[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:43.880]
Because the list that I've got Lou Melnotties, which has been there for like five generations

[00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:46.880]
I guess Jordanos which is uh

[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:48.300]
Geordonos is great

[00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.660]
But I'm told that the lines are like around a block all the time to get in that joint

[00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.900]
Geno's east pizza. We know all which everybody rates real high

[00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:58.500]
But I'm told that pizza. We have dwee which is the same one in rock cross-free this much better

[00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:03.100]
And Chicago pizza oven grind remember we had to call about that the other day. Yes. It's like pizza in a bowl

[00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:12.020]
Pizza in a bowl. Hmm. So that's the list I've got so far. Maybe we'll get some advice on that from some people who maybe from Chicago or whatever

[00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:15.480]
You know will you all the most of the Midwest people around the west coast of Florida?

[00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:20.180]
We've obviously got a few out there, but nevertheless. Oh today is the right day today is Friday right

[00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:22.580]
I want to double check before are we this today's Friday

[00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:26.580]
BSO deputies will conduct the UI saturation patrols tonight

[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:29.260]
8.30 p.m. until 5.30 a.m.

[00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:34.840]

[00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:44.320]
Mar morning if you're going to be driving around plaster drunk off your ass or just uh, you know

[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:49.640]
Have it like a big fat one in the airstrain not a good idea to be doing that in dear field beach pompano beach or open park

[00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:55.320]
Tonight till 5.30 in morning 5.30 morning like come out and just have a wild blast. Okay. Here's the um

[00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:56.860]
Full result from yesterday

[00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:00.600]
Come to QA and hello. Hey, oh good morning. I'm from

[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:04.680]
I'll be down here for eight years. Rosadis is a real good spin truck

[00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:12.000]
Rosadis Rosadis is good at the franchise with a spin truck and then you when you were in Chicago down by

[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.980]
Comiskey market stuff. There's no home run in pizza is very good too. What is it?

[00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:20.740]
Home run in pizza home run in yeah, but those are very

[00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:24.800]
Pizza from Chicago. Okay, I'll run right in thanks a lot. Tell us here you go right off the bat

[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.800]
That's why I punched that up because he was like a huh

[00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:33.320]
You knew that although we weren't at Comiskey park we were a wriggly field but never less than since ones on north side and ones on the south side

[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:37.960]
But nevertheless home run in and Rosadis sounds a real small-sie man sounds a good

[00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:40.700]
Too bad I can't eat no pizza, you know

[00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:44.920]
And even if I got one probably the pizza thief would come and steal it unwittingly

[00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:49.100]
Here's the pull from yesterday and again. This was a Charlie B's. I guess and I don't was this one of his

[00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:53.740]
I don't know what he's apologizing for. Of course he's got plenty to apologize today's whatever

[00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:58.120]
Anybody that works as feverishly as that guy to send us like a half a dozen pulls almost every day

[00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:02.680]
Don't be apologizing for nothing Charlie. That's right. What I mean? We don't look a pull horse in the mouth

[00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:03.680]
That's for show

[00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:09.060]
Embarrassingly I don't know and then we got a bunch of other blanks to fill in. I know the answers to all these

[00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:14.360]
970 69.2% great Americans who know their crap who think they do I hate this pull

[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:16.560]
153 10.9%

[00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:20.240]
Embarrassingly I don't know the words to the star-spangled banner 102

[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:25.340]
Jose can you see you still don't have Jose Felicia? No not that one

[00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:30.100]
Well, why not not out there? Well, what do you mean? Not that one? What do you mean? I like my friends?

[00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:37.060]
Nav your dad and like my fire. Feliz Nav your dad. Yeah. Well, I hope they let him go after cool them out a little

[00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:42.680]
You got like my fire. I got like my father. I'm not talking about by the dough was anybody can play the doors with

[00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:45.660]
There we go. He's so good. Jose Felicia

[00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:52.660]
Whatever happening is he still alive? I think he has hands together folks in prayer. He's got a beautiful wife

[00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:54.280]
Does he really? Have you seen her?

[00:08:55.260 --> 00:09:00.460]
No, he hasn't even I know that's exactly which we're gonna you are so bad. It's such a tasteless little spig man

[00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:06.580]
I think I don't think there's any doubt you're gonna burn in hell. They're gonna roast you and toast them to whatsoever and have you for lunch

[00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:10.800]
You know that it would be untrue. It would be untrue

[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:13.860]
So great

[00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:20.580]
Are you start with the door? I know that was the door. I could close the wire line

[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:23.960]
Okay, that's enough

[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:29.920]
Embracing that I don't the answers to several of these 74 those people ought to be deported immediately probably some of your folks

[00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:34.040]
You know the banana boat crowd are you kidding me? Hey, let's play banana boats. Listen by

[00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:40.400]
Americans are

[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:40.400]

[00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:48.360]
Embracing me. I don't know where Iraq is on a map 37 and I'll see if most of these people would be honest

[00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:52.180]
They couldn't find a wreck if you're stuck in a oozy way inside don't that's right

[00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:57.120]
Iraq my ass. That's what they would say and probably that might be there too the way things are going over there

[00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:58.860]
They're asked is probably a better shaped in Iraq

[00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:04.360]
And I'm vercing it on with answers to any of these 16 who are nations capital is named for 13

[00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:07.040]
I'm sure it's hb countenborn

[00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:11.500]
Who was president before w9 that's the flage of leads is nine

[00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:17.160]
How many states there are in union six what sides fought in the civil war four

What are your American eclarities independence for how many stars there are on the fact flag three

[00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:26.300]
14 emperivodes on yesterday's insipid idiotic qa empol

[00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:31.000]
justice

[00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:32.340]
That's absolutely

[00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:51.760]
No, I really miss my time better start that over again. Okay, I got this liner to read

[00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:57.720]
Join the qm street team today from noon to two with the Verizon wireless store at 100 South Fisk and Boulevard in downtown Miami

Just extend the hand the hand of friendships

[00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:11.920]
There's like the hand of friendship in El Sin

[00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:15.820]
They'll say where do I be signing the thing? Oh right over here

[00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:29.620]

You see she's not very smart. You're here

[00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:38.540]
You might even see her go down

[00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:41.780]
She will always be have dress

[00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:43.760]
hair and meet the rest

[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:45.960]
possibly the fool around

[00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:52.200]
She just came on to say

[00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:56.520]
How one small handy care

[00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:00.380]

What an Aussie eating thought that is 10 17 and 5 60 WDQM in fact

[00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:26.320]
They either one of them now becoming Aussie eating thought maybe she's trying to catch up with him

[00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:32.540]
I guess once upon a time she was considered so desirable and so luscious and delicious and now fat

[00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:33.700]
Their line

[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.560]
Anyway, and you know this thing that I'm asking it seems like a fairly simple question

[00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:42.000]
I'm sure we've got a lot of Chicago people out there and people who have spent a lot of time in the city

[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.900]
But it's I'm not just looking to have a list of names of places you can do that in the yellow pages

[00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:49.480]
You know just open up to pizza in the yellow pages

[00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:53.020]
I'm trying to find out which other really you know maybe three or four really absolute best

[00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:58.520]
By test because it's been I think I said yesterday it's the last time I was there was uh that

[00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:03.380]
Cubs thing that we did, you know, were they like you stay there for about 10 minutes and they sent your ass back

[00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:08.140]
Right well they were afraid you might actually have a good time. They don't want to go to that no

[00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:11.980]
716 votes out of the days pool. I guess we got a thousand made

[00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:16.760]
I was a little worried about it because they they despise this pool that they they hated like poison

[00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:22.340]
I don't know why I don't think there's anything wrong with it. No, maybe this doesn't have enough dumb expressions on it

[00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:23.900]
I think it's fine just fine

[00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:28.680]
The dumbest expression that people say is and I hate this pool is winning 164

[00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:31.280]
23% of the audience hates this pool today

[00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:07.320]
So honestly, how is that? I mean did they let you out on Fridays only or what is it?

[00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:13.060]

[00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:33.600]
We just don't have enough stupid expressions on there

[00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:38.440]
How about back in the day? Okay, well, I've been both on there I've put them both on there

[00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:42.460]
Because I think they're both like kind of contemporaneous if he asked me whatever the hell that means back in the day

[00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:45.560]
Good to go. Yeah back in the day everybody was good to go

[00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:50.800]

Well, how about the expression you were in my shoes

[00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:03.240]
If you were in my shoes, yeah, like you and my shoes would be pretty damn busy in there

It's gonna snow later this afternoon again

[00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:20.920]
I guess this is gonna be the last place because I noticed a predicting for next week one day 63 another day 65 to which I say

[00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:21.580]
All right

[00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:27.000]
What's wrong with that? Because once once the temperature warms up into machines that would buy and warm up too

[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.100]
Anybody buying that? Anybody believe it? No including me no chance

[00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:31.640]

Yeah, let's stop saying that right now stop saying you know what I mean? Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Yeah

[00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:08.100]
That's not a stupid expression huh

[00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:10.940]
Is that 130 down votes on the pool

[00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:17.260]
Leprechaun speed trap net Florida drivers there's some good to stuff some people send in this morning already which is good

[00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:22.300]

Get out of here make it snappy snappy. It's okay. That's a dumb expression make it snappy

[00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:40.800]

[00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:58.740]
You know like I'm gonna go take another shower with my body wash

[00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:04.420]
In the fact that there are still people using soap in the shower that is so aggravating to me

[00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:10.200]
It just makes me want to just just squat and do a any norms number run my carpet here that we wouldn't be too happy

[00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:13.420]
But I just makes me want to do stuff like that. Well, what is wrong with people?

[00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:13.720]
You know

When there's so much it's not like it's expensive to buy body wash

[00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:21.780]
You know you can buy a bottle of body wash for a couple of bucks up

[00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:23.920]
But it's not like real expensive, you know plus

[00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:24.700]

Over down to 22.6% hate the poll

[00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:30.000]
A festival of hate that's life in South Florida. You know 31 years plus plus uh 15 days now

[00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:32.800]
At every day I can smell it man

[00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:38.380]
You can smell the hate in the year and I just asked myself what uh is it all about why why why is there so much

[00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:43.800]
Why are these people so filled with nausea and disgust and just hatred and content for anything and everybody else

[00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:47.340]
Anything that's breathing anything that's even the blades of grass

[00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:50.980]
They like go out of their way to step on not just step on the grasses. They're walking

[00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:55.580]
But like you know crunch it in with the shoe, you know like you're putting out a cigarette. Yeah, how people do that?

[00:20:55.960 --> 00:21:01.400]
Squash it. Squash it and like dig it into their guy. Just oh get it get it

[00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:02.780]
That's what they want

[00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:06.040]
Of course, who don't want to get it W.A.M. Hello

[00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:08.500]
Neil yes, sir

[00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:10.500]
At the end of the day

[00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:14.300]
That's the end of the day. Oh, I hate that one. Yeah at the end of the day

[00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:19.540]
Oh, I do the hell what yeah, but just thought a one that I go ahead and stand

[00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:25.960]
I don't even know what it means in your heart of hearts. Oh, I really love all the walkers. Let's get just like these people

[00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:30.220]
Let's start hating. I hate that right like what does that even mean at the end of the day. Yeah

[00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:35.120]
There's some radio person who like oh, you know who it is built-hanner used to say really

[00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:40.480]
She would she would always be in the way and I still gave what what and he just said at the end of the day

[00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:44.940]
I don't know. I guess that's when he was trying to explain to me at least the the checks clear in this place

[00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:49.220]
Even though this is back in the beginning. You know, I thought other days full of crap and back in the day

[00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:51.100]
And they were not good to go, you know

[00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:52.840]
750 on the pole

[00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:56.760]
Well Greg read was never good to go. That's what I that's what scurrying told me

[00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:00.680]
750 votes on the polls. Isn't it amazing the tremendous turnover we've had

[00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:07.400]
Since we had a regime change you got no more scurrying no more water Nazi no more mole. How are you still around?

[00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:12.400]
She's working for power now. Who is scurrying? She made a comeback. Yeah, that's right

[00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:15.900]
I'm just saying all of all the Greg's buddies that like she's over power because he's over there now

[00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:18.700]
That's right. She's over in the side of building to be close to Greg

[00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:22.540]
So all of these people have vanished kind of like most of the audience too

[00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:31.000]
Oh

[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.000]
Well, that's my soul was wrong with me

[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.540]
Because of 100 bucks to film my SUV

[00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:41.040]
The price of unleading keeps you going up my car

[00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:43.200]
I can't feel a

[00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:46.280]

[00:22:57.740 --> 00:22:59.340]
Talk truckers my car

[00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:01.560]

[00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:05.060]

You know something where there's an old expression

I think that sums it up really well where there's no sense there's no feeling you know what I mean

[00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:37.400]
Well, they're all sent to you feeling yeah

[00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:39.440]

[00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:07.480]

774 votes. Well, there's never they were trying to get hold there trying to hold on it until late. Well, whatever

[00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:26.840]
774 on the poll we'll get that thousand day by uh by hooker by crook. That's another stupid expression by hooker by crook

[00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:29.320]
On there. All right. We'll do it. Oh, it's not on there

[00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:32.540]
We'll put it on there. Oh my crook. That's how we'll do it too

[00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:35.220]
Here's the lineup today, man. We got mad dog at two

[00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:39.600]
Power hour with mad dog only at four because I see it. I don't know my clearance does that

[00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:43.500]
You know, why can't you just say jimmanage two to five the humbers on here today then we got gildi

[00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:48.040]
At five tough loss for the panthers last night. They blew the lead twice. They lost to Buffalo

[00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:51.340]
I told you it smelled like a loss to me and it was five three right there in a macarena

[00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:54.560]
And I watched a little bit of that game. I saw so many

[00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:57.220]
Saber fans man looked like the game was in Bufalo

[00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:01.660]
I just couldn't believe it and then toward the end of the game is they were counting down the last seconds of the game

[00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:03.380]
The crowd was screaming and carrying on like

[00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:07.880]
Like it was the home team was gonna win five to three. I don't know what the hell's going on in that joint

[00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:12.560]
But nevertheless like I said the whole cut panthers hockey. That's an oxymoron

[00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:14.800]
No playoffs again this year. I'm awfully sorry

[00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:19.160]
And the marlins in the medicine Jupiter at 6.50 night Eddie came from Vegas after the baseball game

[00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:23.400]
That's always a big ratings builder those marlin games especially the ones right there in the middle of the daytime

[00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:25.880]
Let's pull it on about eleven o'clock sounds good to me

[00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:30.460]
Can you imagine the pressure pack power a half hour? We could do from 1038 to 11

[00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:32.340]
We got 22 minutes to go that would be good

[00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:35.140]
WQ I am hello

[00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:36.840]

Yes sir you're forgetting forget about it is yeah everybody in the brother

[00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:49.160]
You know you know another one that they say now because of the soprano is because they ripped off all the godfather stuff

[00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:50.640]
Forget about it is one and

[00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:53.680]
We're just about a being

[00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:56.200]
About it

[00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:58.980]
Yeah forget about it right about a being done an expression

[00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:01.420]
It's a it's a it's a void right and the

[00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:02.900]
Spend of the name of a strip club

[00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:06.560]
Yeah, I don't really care okay. I'm really interested in the sopranos

[00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:11.080]
I know everybody says oh you've got to watch you just such a good father thing like you know something it's nothing about father

[00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:15.020]
Okay, it ain't no godfather. It's not supposed to be well that good

[00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:21.620]
I don't need to watch it because it's just a bunch of over acted the tag in over emotional hysterical like you know

[00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:26.620]
It's hanging drama queens is what it is and I wish I could play some of those droppings that we used to play

[00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:30.920]
We can't play it normal. Yeah, I did watch South Park last night. It must have been the wrong episode

[00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:35.860]
Well, they played two of them back to back a repeat in the new one. I saw the one about the planetarium

[00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:37.160]
Yeah

[00:30:38.060 --> 00:30:40.260]
Okay, I was funny planetarium

[00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:44.940]
That was the the old zone and then you should wait for the next one

[00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:48.940]
Was that supposed to be really funny because it wasn't no it wasn't the one that I was telling you oh

[00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:51.900]
Oh, I like the fact that Carpman got the um

[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:57.160]
He he well he didn't actually win the thing but he got the end of the finals doing the

[00:30:57.160 --> 00:31:02.680]
The doodles or whatever that the cheesy puffs poofs or whatever right. It's the one where I got this on I love right week

[00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:05.500]
Yeah, oh there are all the lines were in that

[00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:10.980]
779 boats on the pool. Here's what we got so far the dumbest expression people say I hate this pool

[00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:15.800]
Still got 22 for some but coming down 172 two shakes of a lambs hill 119

[00:31:16.220 --> 00:31:18.340]
Picking a poke 83. Yeah poke this

[00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:20.740]
Never stole a freight train 71

[00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:25.960]
Look at the split 63 which of course a lot of you guys are thinking oh, we know what that means ha ha ha yeah right ever do

[00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:33.420]
No comment in a kounz age 63 a feather in your crab a cat 46 never heard a dumb expression 42 idiots

[00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:42.900]
That is a doornale 41 dumbest dirt 21 as the crow flies 16 went my whistle 15 how about wet my beak like Don Faneuchi

[00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:49.960]
Uh what my whistle's hop skip and a jump 13 in the heart of and your heart of hearts for you know what I mean for

[00:31:50.540 --> 00:31:57.100]
Huh you know what I mean? Huh? Huh? Huh? What do you mean? I don't know first time cover long time listener three that just drives me up the wall

[00:31:57.100 --> 00:32:01.660]
I want to climb I want to do like plastic spastic man or spider-man and climb up the wall

[00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:06.060]
Back in the day three good to go with three at the end of the day two

[00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:09.940]
By hooker by crook make it snappy and if you were in my shoes

[00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:14.140]
Those who got the big old so far to 74 almost 800 votes already run a rule

[00:32:16.660 --> 00:32:17.260]
Let's see

[00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:23.500]
Just about air week ass connected with sports love to use expression he or she is in control of their own destiny

[00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:27.420]
That's that's not good. It says well if one could control destiny wouldn't be destiny would it?

[00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:32.420]
Well, yeah, it says maybe the dumbest sports expression could be a subcategory or separate pool. Oh, yeah

[00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:37.980]
He takes it to the hole well. I open up some avenues. I guess I do you

[00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:44.200]
Last night my uncle Tony joined my wife and kids at the olive tree restaurant now my uncle Tony

[00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:47.520]
He's an Italian cuisine connoisseur if it ain't perfect

[00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:49.180]
He's not happy now

[00:32:49.180 --> 00:32:53.300]
I couldn't believe it when he said the chicken parmesan was the best he'd ever tasted

[00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:58.580]
Plus he kept raven about the free breadsticks and all the salad you could eat my uncle Tony

[00:32:58.580 --> 00:33:03.460]
Recommends you come down to the olive tree because when you're here you're family and by that

[00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:07.900]
I mean you know in the family like last night this couple was done eating right and they were

[00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:13.660]
Walking out and my uncle says where you going and they say we're heading not to see a movie and Tony says huh, huh

[00:33:13.660 --> 00:33:16.680]
Not until you head down to the four eighth club and put a hit on a

[00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:22.520]
Pobo moroni and these people freaked out right they start laughing because they didn't realize my uncle was serious

[00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:25.580]
And then once you eat at the olive tree you're in the family, right?

[00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:28.360]
So Tony stands up and he says what's so funny?

[00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:31.800]
Do I am news you am I some kind of clown or something?

[00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:36.580]
Then he takes a steak knife right and he starts sticking this guy and he's sticking him right

[00:33:36.580 --> 00:33:42.980]
Well anyway the meal was great the olive tree restaurant when you're here your family forever

[00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:45.900]
Right 1047 least for a half hour at least still

[00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:49.220]
They bring the wheel to the table like I get said them cork out of the bottle

[00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:53.360]
I still keep thinking about Celetto and that exasperated look like you know you ever gonna get that thing

[00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:56.240]
Open seeing get out of here. We can talk. You know. What's wrong with you?

[00:33:57.040 --> 00:34:00.720]
Somebody fasses this in I don't think you do one of these qualify

[00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:03.760]
I found it in the last place I looked

[00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:07.680]
I mean that is stupid. It's a stupid thing to say because obviously

[00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:13.360]
Yeah, I if you if you found it then wherever you found it that was the last place you look even if it was the first place you looked

[00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:17.360]
It still was the last place you look I thought it the second to the last place I looked oh, well that's good

[00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:23.600]
The least it wasn't the very last I hate when that happens and then and says love. He's a sharp as a cue ball

[00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:26.940]
See this is this is an expressions for goyam

[00:34:27.640 --> 00:34:33.500]
Because the way it's really said sharp as a mozza ball as the way it said or the way that most the Gentiles would say sharp as a

[00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:34.280]
marble not sharp

[00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:36.100]
Hello you

[00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:38.080]
Huh great you're cutting out

[00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:42.860]
What do you mean by that? Well that you were talking and then you weren't now you are again

[00:34:43.420 --> 00:34:48.980]
Yeah, well how many times that happens? So just one all my lights are all just relax. Okay, you get so damn it

[00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:52.960]
I don't even know about it. It's like what you tell me yesterday about the bokeh about chicken neck

[00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:58.800]
The station has and paintings and why don't have any paintings anywhere whenever the hell was that?

[00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:03.160]
To grand in our rear as he says there what like two thousand dollars behind

[00:35:03.940 --> 00:35:07.800]
Well, I a guy like him can't afford to be too grand in or in your ears. I know

[00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:10.560]
My god when you people gonna get with it

[00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:15.280]
And one hell of this is this audience you know I have had one call or one fax about the Chicago pizza

[00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:19.620]
Which is okay? I guess you know the best way to do it when you go somewhere you try yourself then you find out

[00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:24.520]
Because everybody in their brother can give you all kinds of suggestions and tell you this but a beat but a book

[00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:27.160]
Although it would be nice to get a few pointers like if you're going to Rome

[00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:30.100]
I'll tell you about my favorite trot 3 and my favorite pizza rear in Rome

[00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:34.800]
On the Prince of E Amadeo via Prince of E Amadeo

[00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:41.300]
Well, what a great trot 3 imagine. I just love that place. In fact if I if I wait like 130 pounds if I was underweight

[00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:44.640]
Not diabetic. I would just get on a plane right now and go there and just man

[00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:50.460]
Juman juman to the food in a Roma baby unless I have I will admit this. I did have a couple of bad meals there

[00:35:51.660 --> 00:35:55.520]
You know when somebody tells you oh, it's such a great place for food. You can't get a bad meal there

[00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:58.280]
Well if you're going to wrong joint, you know, you can get a bad meal anywhere

[00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:03.200]
You know what I'm saying what he made her he was with that again. You know what I'm saying

[00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:05.560]
There was another poll too

[00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:09.300]
Oh, now here you go. Here's some South Florida tourists and my suggestions

[00:36:09.740 --> 00:36:14.640]
If somebody from out of town visits South Florida make sure they don't miss see what I would do is make sure they didn't do it

[00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:18.200]
Right if I want to be a nice guy say oh don't go there. You don't want to go to South Florida

[00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:23.840]
Make sure they don't miss South Beach and that for a zoo the monkey jungle little Havana the near Roger show now. We're talking

[00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:28.880]
Oh god. What else is there the jungle queen dinner crew speaking of queens saw grass mills mall

[00:36:30.220 --> 00:36:32.680]
My Kai spelled my Kia

[00:36:33.820 --> 00:36:36.140]
Maybe they're talking about their car. I have no idea

[00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:43.160]
Kia my Kai I would advise them not to come right here this boy. I like that. That's very very good. Very nice. I like it

[00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:45.200]
Oh

[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:49.120]
A lot of faxes this morning man. Oh here. Oh and you know something

[00:36:50.060 --> 00:36:55.440]
This is the winter and I say it all the time and I hate saying it because it's they're got a very excellent point

[00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:56.720]
Can I be honest with you

[00:36:57.340 --> 00:37:02.460]
Or to be honest with you I say that all the time. I don't know why because I am honest to them honest to a fault

[00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:06.380]
I'm not one of those I mean L.I. when I need to like anybody else, but not that much

[00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:12.480]
You know what do you mean? No, and then to like friends of mine. I don't lie

[00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:16.420]
And I'm trying to think if I even like tell white lies. I just don't lie. There's no point

[00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:22.800]
Right, but when somebody says can I be honest with him the faxes is no lie to me. I prefer that right if you were married

[00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:23.540]
You'd lie a lot

[00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:30.180]
But I'm not married and isn't that a wonderful thing? Yeah, maybe that's why I'm still alive. Maybe why I made it to 64 maybe make it to 94 okay

[00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:36.900]
Because I'm not in a that persuasion or is a pet boom would say friendly persuasion

[00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:42.440]
It's 20 days ago you got 810 votes on a pool there were creeped we're creeping along toward the 900 mark

[00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:45.100]
We'll get to a thousand bite to not too much more than that though

[00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:47.820]
Because let me see how much they hate

[00:37:47.820 --> 00:37:53.880]
You know 21.7 22% hate to pull us the leading and the interesting part of it is

[00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:58.580]
It's part of the fact that they hate to pull so much we're getting a zillion calls with people coming up with other expressions

[00:37:58.580 --> 00:37:59.720]
It's a great pull

[00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:02.080]
There's the damn thing wrong with it

[00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:06.620]
Is there anything wrong with it? No, here's a fact. I'm not gonna bother to send

[00:38:06.620 --> 00:38:12.020]
Yes, it's the it says how could we forget the stupidest expression frequently used by this

[00:38:12.020 --> 00:38:14.340]
stupidest a holes and then it doesn't say what that is

[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:25.100]
I see well, maybe they overlooked maybe they got so emotionally overwrought. I don't know

[00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:34.700]
560.0560.560 leave Verizon singular wireless line wq a.m. Hello. Hey Neil. Yes. I have a couple of them. I don't like

[00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:57.160]
I love that scene man where Clemens is making yeah

[00:38:57.160 --> 00:39:00.500]
Michael's making a phone call to a K and the Clemens is making the

[00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:07.720]

Hey, he's good Clemens. It was so great. Yeah, he was

[00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:19.880]
That's why when we take those stupid ass polls about what you know your favorite character from the godfather

[00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:21.380]
I just say all of the above, you know

[00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:25.680]
Sure, it's hard to pick one out and say yeah, they weren't very good. I'm talking about the first two movies

[00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:29.960]
Obviously in the third we could start getting carried away. I was pretend it didn't never happened

[00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:33.580]
Pretend that it won't I still say there was some really good stuff in here too bad

[00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:37.180]
They ruined the good story with all the bad acting but and the bad dialogue and the bad

[00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:38.060]
whatever

[00:39:38.060 --> 00:39:43.020]

Marlowe's name was had the orange peel in his mouth. They're trying to scare the granted there. He's trying to scare Anthony

[00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:59.640]
Remember he was there going through and then of course the bug spray like orange is killed if you're a dog

[00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:05.760]
I guess so I guess and that's because oranges the citrus fruit come from Florida. They're killers. Well, you're being else in Florida

[00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:09.760]
See do you think they're a lot of old people in Florida when those people came to Florida they were like

[00:40:10.980 --> 00:40:16.080]
30 about like five years ago now they all look like 80 and 90 and 100ness because they've had a rough life in Florida

[00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:20.680]

[00:46:30.700 --> 00:46:35.240]

That's good and the wheel spin the wheel spinning but the hamsters did

[00:46:41.900 --> 00:46:50.380]
Oh, these are beautiful. That sounds like a dick pertin bit just there. It really did

[00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:54.000]
Or like a Larry Lou Jack with a cowboy title zoom

[00:46:54.860 --> 00:46:58.700]
Let's see you're either with us or against us repeated by the most dangerous man in the world. I'm not

[00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:08.100]

[00:47:10.980 --> 00:47:14.320]
The wheel spinning but the hamsters dead

[00:47:15.340 --> 00:47:17.860]
Oh, man 24 a cent short of a quarter. I like that

[00:47:18.860 --> 00:47:24.800]
It says what about that stupid saying that always rears its ugly head during hurricane season pack your patience

[00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:28.360]
I hate that you have packed this pack your patience

[00:47:28.860 --> 00:47:33.300]
Usually the weather fairy always says that he's you know, he's got packing on the mind I guess

[00:47:34.540 --> 00:47:38.580]
Well, of course, he's probably getting a lot of a practice now is that the miss uh, what's your name?

[00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:44.740]
On a side out of mind and weather fairy which one which one it's in the slamer

[00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:47.060]
For like of a better term

[00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:52.780]
Come on miss come on see I actually had a brain for her trying to forget about her

[00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:58.520]
And then of course miss nor crusts her alternator warning canceled for Florida's flagra beat area

[00:47:58.520 --> 00:48:04.540]
Well, thank the Lord for that. We prayed and prayed and prayed we put our hands together in our knees together and our cheeks together

[00:48:04.540 --> 00:48:06.360]
And the the Lord said all right

[00:48:06.980 --> 00:48:07.840]
To North Beach

[00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:11.500]
Clearly the light has been turned off a very dark storm

[00:48:11.500 --> 00:48:17.600]
It saw one flash of lightning there's another boy right there. I'm talking about the end of my life in my speaking north probably northeast if I can tell you

[00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:20.560]
On up toward the north beach I believe

[00:48:21.140 --> 00:48:27.920]
My name is there's a lot of citizenship right here. I see it in the world wide. It's so dark. It's fister. It's fister Miami, baby

[00:48:29.180 --> 00:48:35.020]

Lots of storms and mung and stuff and supposed to snow a little bit here maybe like half an inch later on today

[00:49:03.100 --> 00:49:05.300]
Not good. Not good. We don't want no more snow

[00:49:05.300 --> 00:49:11.100]
Don't be given us this springtime t-ge you know when it's like 14 15 16 degrees Celsius like around 60s

[00:49:11.100 --> 00:49:14.360]
And then all of a sudden it's gonna snow a little bit. Yeah, you're gonna good indeed winner

[00:49:14.840 --> 00:49:19.400]
That's the way the Lord messes with your brain. He's evil. He's a sadist 2 a.m. Hello

[00:49:20.020 --> 00:49:23.300]
Uh, how about uh, but lipstick on a pig it still fits

[00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:25.300]
Lipstick on a pig, y'all okay

[00:49:25.780 --> 00:49:30.700]
That's for lipstick on this pig. That's what the stock market guys were saying back during that that whole phony thing that the

[00:49:30.700 --> 00:49:34.060]
Entire CNBC crew even the cameraman ought to be in jail for that

[00:49:34.060 --> 00:49:40.600]
Whilst the new economy against the old time and instead of that they get this crazy cramer guy and then all of a sudden he's like a a bit called hero

[00:49:40.600 --> 00:49:40.900]
You know

[00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:47.100]
See that's the one thing any anytime you get some jackass. That's a real goofball and they're like he's a big hero with a college crowd

[00:49:47.100 --> 00:49:48.280]
You know because he's a jackass

[00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:54.120]
Like the movie, you know everything that's like a goofy jackass. Oh, he's really great that crazy cramer

[00:49:54.120 --> 00:49:57.320]
I want to give him all my money and see if he can lose it and he could

[00:49:57.900 --> 00:50:00.480]
You're in seed. I'm confident. Somebody Q a n. Hello

[00:50:01.220 --> 00:50:02.600]
Hello. Yes, sir

[00:50:03.740 --> 00:50:06.340]
Well, you could have been a pull on that list of the

[00:50:07.480 --> 00:50:12.920]
How do you pardon? You could have been a pull on one with the loan. Yeah, that's right

[00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:16.400]
And and

[00:50:18.020 --> 00:50:22.780]
Let's see the other one was just because your head comes to a point doesn't mean your show

[00:50:25.080 --> 00:50:25.480]
Oh

[00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:30.600]
Okay, I don't think that one's going to blind up on a pull, but that's kind of cute

[00:50:31.160 --> 00:50:32.980]
I mean yeah on a scale of zero

[00:50:35.720 --> 00:50:39.180]
Let's see see these people have been frustrated because we don't do the building polls anymore

[00:50:39.180 --> 00:50:44.100]
Thank the Lord. I hated those all doesn't it boring the man the myth the legend all right

[00:50:44.100 --> 00:50:45.440]
They must be talking about

[00:50:46.700 --> 00:50:52.740]
Legendary the man the myth the legend that's stupid and for the sports nerds anything beginning with walkoff walkoff

[00:50:52.780 --> 00:50:57.020]
Run walkoff single walkoff walk etc walkoff home run

[00:50:58.500 --> 00:51:00.660]
I think we can just stick with a walkoff home run thing

[00:51:00.660 --> 00:51:05.560]
I mean if we want to do the sports ones. I mean there's 80's in those and he has fans responsible for most of them

[00:51:05.560 --> 00:51:06.800]
Oh Sammy goes yard

[00:51:07.500 --> 00:51:09.840]
Well, what does that mean Sammy goes yard?

[00:51:12.060 --> 00:51:18.780]
Sally goes around the roses. What the hell does that mean Sammy goes yard cuz he and all money goes yard a walkoff home run

[00:51:19.660 --> 00:51:24.760]
And like I told Josh when we're arguing about this last year or the season before it just sounds so stupid

[00:51:24.760 --> 00:51:28.000]
You know like oh he had a run of gamers over let's everybody walk off now

[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:33.380]
And then I got to run off the field they're gonna walk off walk off my ass. Okay, and it was a more long walk

[00:51:33.380 --> 00:51:36.320]
I'll get a walk. I'll get a walk. I would be maybe about 10 miles couldn't hurt

[00:51:37.500 --> 00:51:38.420]
Walkoff home run

[00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:46.240]
The desperation see this is the thing now another you got the cable all these sports cable channels in the SPM's got about 50 different channels of their own

[00:51:46.740 --> 00:51:52.140]
And all the other cramp on there they have to they have to try to like take something really terminally boring and make it real exciting

[00:51:52.140 --> 00:51:55.600]
And really spice it up a little bit so they come up with just stupid cliches

[00:51:56.040 --> 00:51:58.580]
Which of course Chris Burman and I don't mind Chris Burman

[00:51:58.580 --> 00:52:00.880]
He was funny from about five minutes you know about 20 years ago

[00:52:01.860 --> 00:52:03.320]
But he's one of the biggest

[00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:09.480]
One of the guiltiest of all I was speaking of guilty. There's Carl Rhodes patients from all and oh my god

[00:52:10.140 --> 00:52:12.500]
One of the all one's this whole crowd gonna wind up in prison

[00:52:12.500 --> 00:52:15.920]
That's what I'd like no federal prison. Let's see him all all chain together on the chain gang

[00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:20.780]
Like we could sweep that could be the theme song for the administration of sand cook working on the chain gang

[00:52:20.780 --> 00:52:23.920]
You got that yes, I do. I love that song you do have to yeah

[00:52:24.740 --> 00:52:26.420]
This is the time of year

[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:32.380]
Everyone's a little bit higher this say Colleen would you be wanting to come over to my place to have me

[00:52:32.380 --> 00:52:33.780]
A wax my shell

[00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:36.920]
Now that I want my Patrick

[00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:41.920]
If you be wet in the green I know there's a smart lassie

[00:52:41.920 --> 00:52:48.340]
She's making sure her lad is wearing the kelly green protection of leprecha condom

[00:52:49.280 --> 00:52:53.120]
Don't be wishin' on a folded clover. I'll file in for the gift of gab

[00:52:53.120 --> 00:52:56.660]
Especially if you're planning on kissing some bloody stones

[00:52:57.280 --> 00:53:04.280]
What have you be doubting your protection with the apricondoms they're strong enough for a man

[00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:11.500]
But I like them too. So check yourself as different condom and your work be catching anything else

[00:53:11.500 --> 00:53:15.760]
1119 to 560s every QAM I go and speak of that here's that story in leprecha

[00:53:15.760 --> 00:53:17.880]
I've tried ten times to read this

[00:53:18.440 --> 00:53:25.160]
First years of facts from dick who says it's one of the stomest things people say these days nowadays is it is what it is

[00:53:27.260 --> 00:53:30.980]
Okay, as opposed to it ain't what it is right it is what it isn't

[00:53:30.980 --> 00:53:34.640]
What that was that supposed to mean he says I hate that one is you would say like poison

[00:53:35.140 --> 00:53:38.580]
He's also sick of people say support the troops especially the hypocrites in DC

[00:53:38.580 --> 00:53:43.000]
And he also says don't ever change. I'll write. I won't can't too late

[00:53:44.100 --> 00:53:48.620]
There was no pata gold behind the dancing roadside leprecha only speeding tickets

[00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:55.580]
Dozens of drivers in the Orlando area found out the hard way yesterday after passing an orange county shift deputy dressed as a leprecha

[00:53:55.580 --> 00:53:57.800]
And warning drivers to slow down

[00:53:58.640 --> 00:54:04.960]
Alazza detector clock cars above his side reading watch your speed or cost you a pata gold and several officers on motorcycles

[00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:11.140]
Chase those who didn't heed the advice deputy Richard Lockman said police are beginning out about a ticket a minutes and say to clock yesterday morning

[00:54:11.140 --> 00:54:16.040]
It was dressed in a green leprecha not filled with a hat tight white knickers and a fake red beard

[00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:23.480]
When about he faked him out Lockman did the same thing with Christmas Elf outfit in December speeders complained that being stuffed by a deputy and

[00:54:23.480 --> 00:54:28.620]
Customers in trapment. I think it's just ridiculous Lockman said the elf didn't force anybody to speed

[00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:35.660]
No, I think he's got a point there. Oh look at this guy secret service arrest man after he jumps the fence of the White House

[00:54:35.660 --> 00:54:42.860]
Maybe just was tried again for like a little lunch, okay? Maybe he made a little lunch for lunch. Oh the fanny wanted an autograph and they dragged his

[00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:48.980]
Not conflicted answer. I'm looking right now with a guy with a beard and gray

[00:54:48.980 --> 00:54:52.880]
You know he probably just looking for maybe spare some change mister something like that, you know

[00:54:52.880 --> 00:54:58.600]
I really hate that. Yeah, I'm very tired of that. I'm just I would say that's probably the only thing

[00:54:58.620 --> 00:55:01.620]
That I really dislike here intensely. I'm trying to think of anything else

[00:55:01.620 --> 00:55:05.180]
I mean, you know the bad winter days which you only had like three or four all year, but

[00:55:06.180 --> 00:55:07.680]
That's the only thing that really bugs me

[00:55:08.180 --> 00:55:12.900]
Is there a way too many homeless people here which I guess you could probably see in any big city and too much of that and

[00:55:13.420 --> 00:55:17.700]
And there are guys just like walking down the street who don't look like you know like that guy there like

[00:55:17.700 --> 00:55:22.840]
They're a destitute or prostitute and oh, you know what some change pal. No

[00:55:23.720 --> 00:55:24.080]
sorry

[00:55:24.900 --> 00:55:28.940]
And I used to say sorry and then I don't even know I just keep walking or now you say sorry

[00:55:29.720 --> 00:55:32.060]
Sorry, no, there's a sorry sorry. Oh, yeah, sorry

[00:55:32.840 --> 00:55:34.760]
That's the Canadian way. Sorry

[00:55:36.040 --> 00:55:40.900]
To straight cast got into a house and attacked three people inside then we're euthanized and checked for rabbis

[00:55:40.900 --> 00:55:45.480]
rabies authority said the cast entered Melissa Breva's house through an open front door on Monday

[00:55:45.480 --> 00:55:49.480]
I wonder where this is does it even say where the hell this was somewhere in central Florida and

[00:55:50.380 --> 00:55:55.280]
Attacked two women visitors and a boy authority said I thought I had seen it all but I've never seen anything like this

[00:55:55.280 --> 00:56:00.920]
Chief of police Martin Gutenstridor said animal control officer John Petter responded to a call for help Gutenstridor said

[00:56:01.940 --> 00:56:02.300]
Gutenstridor

[00:56:03.220 --> 00:56:05.520]
One woman was scratched and bitten on her legs the other woman

[00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:11.460]
And a bit on her right can for after talking then Petter went to his truck for snares then heard screaming from inside the house

[00:56:12.620 --> 00:56:15.640]
When he ran back he saw a young male with blood all over his purse

[00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:21.420]
Gutenstridor said he was bitten on his forehead nose left ear and right cheek after some first aid from Petter

[00:56:21.420 --> 00:56:24.320]
The three were taken to great planes read the memorial center. I don't know where that is

[00:56:24.820 --> 00:56:27.880]
When investigator John Steadler arrived to an open the bedroom door

[00:56:27.880 --> 00:56:32.000]
He saw a green white cat bearing its teeth in attack mode Gutenstridor beside

[00:56:32.540 --> 00:56:35.900]
He shut the bedroom door return to his car for a dark gun both cats were shot

[00:56:36.380 --> 00:56:40.080]
Tranquilized and taken the animal shelter where they were euthanized to which I say oh yeah

[00:56:40.080 --> 00:56:45.620]
The only good cat is that that's bad dev cat you can't say that I just did the bodies were sent to Lincoln for rab-rab-ob

[00:56:46.640 --> 00:56:51.200]
Chucks authorities want to find out who owned the cats other city ordinance and whatever city this was which it doesn't say

[00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:53.740]
Cats may run free if they don't become nuisances

[00:56:54.160 --> 00:56:58.420]
Well, you know cat and nuisances, isn't that what we done and see what seemed to miss a wood

[00:56:59.540 --> 00:57:05.100]
Well, this poll is going over bigger than Mary Tyler man man and the six million dollar more and Gary Moore

Very sad, but that's America man a lot of crazy people with guns a lot of crazy eluintics run around on the loose

[00:57:45.060 --> 00:57:46.920]
Lot of Ted Bundy's out there man

888 votes on the poll 888 just like my last trip to Rome 888 and then of course that was a great trip to Florence to Ferenza

[00:57:55.280 --> 00:57:58.760]
And that place where they had the pigeon eggs and they little piece of gum

[00:57:59.420 --> 00:58:03.040]
Passing itself off as prosciutto for sure. That'll only right

[00:58:04.400 --> 00:58:06.040]
Wish I would have had a gun in that place man

[00:58:06.040 --> 00:58:10.260]
I would like to shot that place up. She charged me 80 euros, which is like, you know about 90 bucks

[00:58:11.420 --> 00:58:16.600]
And when and I think the bottle water is about all we really had there was nothing edible and we finally said

[00:58:16.600 --> 00:58:18.480]

I like that. That's good an untimely death. That's excellent. He died an untimely death. Got a Christmas beauty

[00:59:33.320 --> 00:59:37.860]
Mm-hmm as opposed to I mean, what's a timely death like this is a thing 90

[00:59:38.820 --> 00:59:39.220]
90

[00:59:40.020 --> 00:59:43.320]
You better watch it mister a calendar got 26 years to go until 90

[00:59:43.320 --> 00:59:48.420]
I got a stack a lot of important things to do lots of important stuff a lot of important people to do

[00:59:48.420 --> 00:59:50.880]
I mean to do for whatever I'm good at I don't know to do you for

[00:59:51.660 --> 00:59:55.420]
Look at these people these are the people that they're arrested about this kid getting killed

[00:59:56.160 --> 01:00:03.120]
Look, oh don't wonder, that's the crowd from entry as far as I wish with no teeth always be where some old red necky bitch like that with no teeth

[01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:08.080]
Convicted sex offender. What was he doing on the loose again? That's what I would like to know

[01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:13.200]
Okay, what are these people doing on the loose if you have they find it with like a pin joint in your ass tray

[01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:14.560]
Going away for 20 years minimum

[01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:20.420]
But if you're like a sex offender you're gonna run around raping and the pillaging and looting and plundering and abusing

[01:00:20.420 --> 01:00:22.780]
Then it's like around you know we're gonna be about 20 minutes

[01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:27.560]
Until you cool off. We'll be able to take a cold shower on the inside and then we'll turn your ass out again

[01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:30.080]
They just can't figure out while they while these things happen

[01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:34.420]
It's like the Catholic Church moving and priest around you. Oh, if we just move into a different location

[01:00:34.420 --> 01:00:36.400]
Maybe they'll come up with a different vocation

[01:00:38.380 --> 01:00:42.340]
I'm asking you to think about how some starving children

[01:00:43.980 --> 01:00:45.980]
Not an American Asia

[01:00:45.980 --> 01:00:49.560]
Missy rather is I haven't eaten in a long time

[01:00:49.560 --> 01:00:51.020]
Get your hands off

[01:00:51.020 --> 01:00:53.540]
You see I'm doing a spot here

[01:00:53.540 --> 01:00:55.000]
A burp

[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:55.800]
A little

[01:00:56.540 --> 01:00:59.120]

But I gotta hold these rucksack food supplies into the ship cargo home

[01:01:05.420 --> 01:01:08.700]
You touch that pallet and you're dead meat dog breath

[01:01:11.380 --> 01:01:12.140]

[01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:13.080]
And

[01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:18.300]
This is being the public service announcement for Sally Strother save the children

[01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:24.020]
1131. She's all class and all ass now. Let me ask you there's a bit that we've got all before that

[01:01:24.020 --> 01:01:28.600]
I've been trying to break breaks to remember telling this you better go ahead and give Josh quarters and smack him on ahead

[01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:30.440]
Or maybe he's listening now he's listening

[01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:33.920]
He thinks that he put the stories up for today. There's nothing on it. I'm gonna have to like

[01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:39.700]
Hit the button the button the sender the whatever tell him to hit the sender. Hey, yeah, hit the button schmuck

[01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:47.000]
And what was the other very important thing? It was gonna say just something we important they but you know what if you you lose it, you know

[01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:55.280]
So our good friend Chris says you go girl. How come that's not on there? It is now. Okay, you go girl

[01:01:55.280 --> 01:02:02.520]
That's an Oprah thing. Oh you go that whole sick twisted, you know crap or hers is a cult of Oprah that is correct

[01:02:03.460 --> 01:02:04.640]
And then that one I just

[01:02:05.740 --> 01:02:06.860]
Yeah, I heard that

[01:02:09.140 --> 01:02:09.500]
Yeah

[01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:12.800]
What I'll do with respect to them. I mean, you know, we love that well. I heard that they got a camera

[01:02:15.460 --> 01:02:21.220]
Let's see here's a fact that says oh yeah, this one was on that other lengthy one a few fry short of a happy meal

[01:02:21.860 --> 01:02:25.100]
Like that although I do like 24 cent short of a quarter is good

[01:02:27.060 --> 01:02:29.320]
You dance with the one that what brung you

[01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:33.100]
That sounds like a real redneck you think you dance with the one what brung you

[01:02:33.100 --> 01:02:34.760]
Mm-hmm and

[01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:38.840]
Chomping at the bit which stupid schmit used to say champion of it. Oh

[01:02:39.620 --> 01:02:44.300]
This is osky formerly from Montreal and definitely not a frog. Oh, what's that bit there with the airplane stuff?

[01:02:44.300 --> 01:02:48.580]
And where he says there's a sale of pennies. What's that bit called? Oh, Titanic. That's it

[01:02:49.340 --> 01:02:51.200]
Just see before you could even answer

[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:57.920]
It was okay. Well, I'll play that after the break make a nice break

[01:02:58.660 --> 01:03:03.300]
And also here's another Chris we got lots of Chris is on there so many Chris isn't so little time, you know

[01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:07.440]
Who says I used to live in Miami several years ago and listen to you. I now live in Utah

[01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:11.280]
I'm sorry Chris and listen online heard you talking about the food in Chicago

[01:03:11.940 --> 01:03:14.820]
Geordano is the best place. That's the best piece I've ever had in my life

[01:03:14.820 --> 01:03:19.140]
He says uh, but I'll be put a boop a bit about anyway. I love the show and glad to be listening again

[01:03:19.140 --> 01:03:24.760]
Thanks Chris in Utah and that nice see somebody online is telling me you know on the phone on the fax

[01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:30.360]
They don't want to give me any advice about that. Maybe they never been to Chicago. Maybe they never had no Chicago piece of leafish stick

[01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:32.740]
Really great stuff that weighs about a half upon the slides

[01:03:35.100 --> 01:03:36.940]
It really is something man

[01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:42.180]
And I still don't understand because we did have uh, uno is once a part of time in South Florida

[01:03:42.180 --> 01:03:45.040]
Anything that's good doesn't last too long in that right like Sonic

[01:03:46.100 --> 01:03:48.780]
Sonic went by by mm-hmm. Well, I'll be damned

[01:03:49.740 --> 01:03:53.040]
Anything that's really fantastic like godfather's right

[01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:56.160]
I mean, I know you still got that one probably up by the Hess station if it's still there

[01:03:56.160 --> 01:03:59.980]
Did you tell me it was or wasn't I'm really I don't know I think I told you know that I just find out

[01:03:59.980 --> 01:04:01.660]
Fudruckers is gone. What's gonna be next?

[01:04:01.820 --> 01:04:05.260]
First it was corkies now it's fudruckers and it was godfather's right

[01:04:05.940 --> 01:04:08.060]
I'm gonna tell you man when I was at WS news

[01:04:08.060 --> 01:04:12.600]
That's when I discovered there was a godfather's on sunset. They're not far from where taco vb used to be

[01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:18.320]
And I don't care what anybody says any of my people online there give me about the taco v with the best thing was about a beep

[01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:20.680]
The best thing was the squeeze cheese man

[01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:26.860]
Hmm they had that orange the real orange moussi and squeeze cheese that they put in the burritos and on the tacos

[01:04:26.860 --> 01:04:32.300]
Oh, my taco v was great. I mean I do like Taco Bell, but it ain't no taco viva

[01:04:32.300 --> 01:04:33.740]
mm-hmm

[01:04:33.740 --> 01:04:36.540]
And right on that simple strip shopping center that on sunset

[01:04:37.620 --> 01:04:41.360]
Between I want to say like a hundred and seventh f and the whatever in Galilee road

[01:04:42.220 --> 01:04:48.120]
Right in between there was the first godfather's and I wasn't w's news and it came on ears a sponsor in the manager that place

[01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:51.580]
I've put it a story a million times, but I can't get heavier out of my mind. Hey, have you

[01:04:54.360 --> 01:04:57.620]
He was the young guy in his early 20s and his family you know started the

[01:04:58.760 --> 01:05:02.640]
Well his family actually all bought a bin jail or something really well

[01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:09.020]
They were like you know, no, I don't know. They had a bunch of businesses. I don't know and I see all on the up and up or whatever

[01:05:09.020 --> 01:05:14.160]
That means there's another stupid expression on the up and up is huh? That's a monkey business. I don't know

[01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:17.340]
But he was a fine young man and he just loved me man

[01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:22.200]
Haviour hey, Haviour boy, but now that's his Indian years ago. He must be in a wheelchair or something right now

[01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:24.840]
He must have a walker see that's the depressing part

[01:05:25.660 --> 01:05:29.760]
I think back to all those days like the days of Zeta, you know, and all those because it was on FM

[01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:31.720]
So we had all those living and breathing young people listening

[01:05:31.720 --> 01:05:35.940]
It's a miracle. We have any young people listen here on AM on a scratchy AM radio station

[01:05:35.940 --> 01:05:37.920]
I mean, it's a freaking miracle

[01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:41.040]
Especially with a tremendous promotion at this station gives for everybody

[01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:46.840]
And especially following well, I don't want to say I don't want to go into that because then I should feel what do the guy say I should feel guilty?

[01:05:48.620 --> 01:05:52.960]
Yeah, they should feel guilty on payday. They should feel really guilty those guys WQ. I am hello

[01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.940]
Dale yes, sir. I got a few of them boy here

[01:05:58.080 --> 01:06:04.520]
Yeah, I might have missed the last couple of minutes of the Haviour he's already forgive me is the Pope Catholic is the Pope Catholic?

[01:06:04.700 --> 01:06:07.300]
I like that. Is the Pope Jewish? Yeah does the Pope wear a funny hat?

[01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:11.800]
Okay, there's one that you say all the time and I don't just don't get it side by each

[01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:18.320]
Oh, that's a Canadian thing if the the only person I ever heard say that is Frank Suley who's a great racetrack announcer

[01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:25.100]
calls harness racing at Western fear used to be a woodbite and he used to say when the horses were like next to each other instead of side by side

[01:06:25.100 --> 01:06:29.460]
He would say side by each which is just a Canadian thing I guess I don't know

[01:06:29.460 --> 01:06:34.380]
Okay now by duck in a row you got all these ducks in a row your ducks in a row. Yeah, there they are all lined up

[01:06:34.380 --> 01:06:36.820]
Let's get them. That's the way Cheney likes them all lined up

[01:06:37.300 --> 01:06:40.880]
All right now this one you say you don't call you say it doesn't bear

[01:06:42.460 --> 01:06:44.580]
What is it does a bear?

[01:06:44.980 --> 01:06:51.380]
Dog on bear does a bear oh those are the bear in the woods yeah that's right yeah

[01:06:52.020 --> 01:06:54.500]
Okay, I would imagine probably the answer is yes

[01:06:54.500 --> 01:06:58.180]
Yeah, like the Pope Catholic right okay now

[01:06:58.180 --> 01:07:00.740]
Let me get off the subject a little bit because

[01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:05.200]
Couple of guys on you show it you talk about all the time and I show it

[01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:07.580]
Well, yeah, I've got a nice show here

[01:07:09.240 --> 01:07:09.760]
Yeah

[01:07:11.520 --> 01:07:15.160]
You talk about a guy I must be Jewish because I don't know

[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:20.180]
As first name was he public what is it grand trip Richmond

[01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:28.440]
You ever hear that no you say it all the time it's time to be real fast so she's a grand

[01:07:29.700 --> 01:07:32.840]
No, you never you never said the grand trip Richmond

[01:07:33.260 --> 01:07:40.900]
Oh, great took Richmond grand very listen to this is yeah is this supposed to be a fun as a serious

[01:07:40.900 --> 01:07:43.740]
All right, what about bombing it okay see a pal

[01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:48.360]
He was going along real well to start when they start with the amateur comedy man

[01:07:48.360 --> 01:07:51.560]
That's when I start getting really impatient. That's when my fingers start going to button

[01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:52.560]
Like that

[01:07:55.320 --> 01:07:56.520]
Like Tim Hardaway

[01:07:57.560 --> 01:08:01.240]
Okay, how are we doing on this nine 14 that's not too bad. We'll make the thousand easy

[01:08:01.240 --> 01:08:02.900]
No no reason to sweat at Chris

[01:08:04.140 --> 01:08:07.660]
I'm now I'm ready for Taco Bell. I know that was really bad. I got started on that see

[01:08:07.660 --> 01:08:11.900]
I'm I'm too impressionable and sometimes I'm impressionable to stuff. I say myself

[01:08:12.740 --> 01:08:15.820]
When you're talking crap for four hours every day and getting paid a lot of money for it

[01:08:15.820 --> 01:08:21.260]
And then you start reacting to it yourself then you must really be pretty good. Oh, I were doubted 20.5 percent. I hate this pool

[01:08:22.060 --> 01:08:26.300]
How can I open anybody with any kind of a conscience vote for I hate this pool when everybody in their brother

[01:08:26.300 --> 01:08:29.840]
Know is exactly what we're talking about when we got all these incredibly stupid expressions

[01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:34.600]
I still want to go back to that one page. I save it. I sure hope so. That's worth a re-read

[01:08:35.320 --> 01:08:38.420]
There was some really nifty stuff on there own nifty

[01:08:39.900 --> 01:08:41.040]
How do you spell huda?

[01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:46.740]
I did save it. I said the good stuff. I might even send you some

[01:08:47.500 --> 01:08:49.720]
The wheel spinning but the hamster is dead

[01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:56.300]
Kind of like Richard gear Richard spinning but the gerbil is dead

[01:08:57.500 --> 01:09:01.360]
24 centroid of a quarter the lights are on but nobody's home now. That's a good one

[01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:05.080]
The lights are on but nobody's home

[01:09:06.140 --> 01:09:07.780]
No green in the silo

[01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:14.780]
He's an antenna doesn't pick up all the channels. Her sewing machines out of thread. These are all good

[01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:18.540]
Too bad this could be like about a ten far to a parter, you know

[01:09:19.720 --> 01:09:23.860]
Could be lengthy we can do it for like a month and then of course the sports ones. Oh brother

[01:09:23.860 --> 01:09:28.340]
Nobody comes in our house and pushes us around. Oh man

[01:09:28.340 --> 01:09:33.900]
Talk about that phony macho crap bunch of pansies that take showers together and snap each of his ass with the towel

[01:09:33.900 --> 01:09:36.320]
Nobody comes in our house. Yeah, right

[01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:42.540]
Or my my speaking of house that that one just just kills me. You're gonna take it to the house

[01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:48.820]
That is that part of you. Chris or you're already brainwashed on anything. That's good. That's whatever

[01:09:48.820 --> 01:09:53.700]
I thought you ever heard that. George didn't even know what that means. No never heard it before

Water 14 feet above the key of the seven minutes like I think a wrong week's Christmas in the 4p in all three holes and in boyhood

[01:10:29.420 --> 01:10:34.440]

You don't know what fingers been that's five compartments and it looks like a big tile and all she can say afloat

[01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:43.160]
With the first four compartments breached but not five and the bar was staring away

[01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:43.740]
Not five

[01:10:43.740 --> 01:10:49.220]

[01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:38.700]

[01:16:15.640 --> 01:16:18.160]
During a speech on the House floor on the Thursday yesterday

[01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:25.020]
Representative little Dennis Kucinichibal how declared that impeachment may well be the only remedy which remains to stop a war of aggression against Iran

[01:16:26.380 --> 01:16:32.200]
The 2004 presidential candidate was running again in 2008 told raw story that in his house floor statement

[01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:38.680]
It speaks for itself this house cannot avoid its constitutionally authorized responsibility to restrain the abuse of executive power

[01:16:38.680 --> 01:16:42.540]
He said on the four yesterday the administration has been preparing for an aggressive war against Iran

[01:16:42.540 --> 01:16:46.880]
There was no solid direct evidence that Iran has got the intention of attacking the US or its allies

[01:16:47.900 --> 01:16:52.420]
He noted that since the US is a signatory to the UN Charter constituent treaty among nations of the world

[01:16:52.420 --> 01:16:57.040]
And article two states that all members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force

[01:16:57.040 --> 01:17:03.200]
Against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state that even the threat of a war of aggression is ill-eagle

[01:17:04.100 --> 01:17:09.680]
Article six of the constitution makes such treaties the supreme law of the land because they said this administration is openly threatened to

[01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:14.260]
aggression against the Iranian violation of the US Constitution and the UN Charter but a beep bit of boop bit of op

[01:17:14.260 --> 01:17:16.100]
And they said boy you sure are funny looking Dennis

[01:17:16.100 --> 01:17:18.980]
And they won't listen to him because he's like a little goofball, but he's great

[01:17:19.420 --> 01:17:21.740]
He's got the balls to speak up and tell it like it is

[01:17:22.480 --> 01:17:27.980]
And anybody in America who's got the balls to speak up and tell like it is it's like oh gee. What's he starting complaining again?

[01:17:28.360 --> 01:17:30.220]

[01:18:27.600 --> 01:18:29.740]
My criticism to that stuff. Oh, yeah

[01:18:30.420 --> 01:18:30.740]

[01:18:38.100 --> 01:18:44.100]

[01:18:46.220 --> 01:18:46.860]
Yeah, and

[01:18:48.680 --> 01:18:52.360]

That's a good guy. Got you again. Got you again

[01:19:21.460 --> 01:19:26.800]
942 votes on the pool the dumbest expression that people say I hate this pool is down to 20.2 percent

[01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:28.760]
We're getting close to get under 20%

[01:19:28.760 --> 01:19:32.980]
We do it. It's that it should be like maybe 5 percent. I don't know why the hell they hate this pool

[01:19:33.860 --> 01:19:38.160]
They must be feeling really porky down there. I'm telling you that there must be something really hostile

[01:19:38.160 --> 01:19:42.740]
Like you know the fact that the weather is so bad. It's dark. It looks like three o'clock in the morning instead of like

[01:19:42.740 --> 01:19:44.420]
noon looks like midnight

[01:19:45.540 --> 01:19:51.920]

[01:20:01.440 --> 01:20:05.880]
Wouldn't it be something if it's snow there this afternoon. I'd love that me to can you see the driving?

[01:20:06.140 --> 01:20:10.880]
I'm I often thought about that if it's snowed in Florida, would there be anybody left alive by midnight? No

[01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:19.700]

[01:22:29.580 --> 01:22:31.820]
You've got no girlfriend. Girlfriend Experience

[01:22:31.820 --> 01:22:37.300]
I have no idea depends on what context. I really don't know and quite frankly don't care, but nevertheless

[01:22:37.860 --> 01:22:42.360]
It stands for Girlfriend Experience, pal. This is supposed to be an educational show and there you go

[01:22:42.360 --> 01:22:45.300]
Well, we just got through a ton of games and we can put us call back

[01:22:45.700 --> 01:22:49.960]
Call back Curtis. We want to find out what kind of hate you spank you. What was that in there? Yeah

[01:22:51.140 --> 01:22:54.680]
Girlfriend Experience is that experience or experience girlfriend experiment

[01:22:56.940 --> 01:22:57.980]
It's just an experience

[01:23:00.240 --> 01:23:06.260]
Listen, we're not asking your dead ass. We're asking Curtis. He's obviously the expert pervert on his our kind of guy on the show

[01:23:08.020 --> 01:23:12.240]
567 is obviously he's doing more than just watching the ball scores there on his computer screen

[01:23:12.240 --> 01:23:16.420]
You know, I'm saying as much further than he's going to more than websites than just espn.com

[01:23:16.420 --> 01:23:22.060]
Is what I'm thinking could be wrong about that, but I doubt it adieu did wqway and hello

[01:23:23.380 --> 01:23:25.160]
And here yes sir

[01:23:25.780 --> 01:23:32.700]
I rather you would actually call a hooker a girlfriend being that you would go to them to do things that you wouldn't do your girlfriend anyway

[01:23:33.360 --> 01:23:33.800]
but

[01:23:33.800 --> 01:23:38.300]
Just a quick thing about your show. I love you show, but

[01:23:38.860 --> 01:23:40.660]
Can you read one of those taxes?

[01:23:41.740 --> 01:23:46.120]
Why don't you get yourself a shredder instead of ripping the paper? I mean I'm getting tired of the ripping of the paper

[01:23:46.120 --> 01:23:51.820]
I like it so you don't like ripping the paper go rip a rip your ass. He's getting he's getting tired of it

[01:23:53.200 --> 01:23:56.780]
He might be on the verge of the game. He's getting tired of it. What a schmuck man

[01:23:56.780 --> 01:24:03.280]
You you are wise so many people millions of people are dying their desperate. They're like is it's like trying to break the door down in a prison

[01:24:03.280 --> 01:24:04.640]
Trying to get out of that place

[01:24:05.880 --> 01:24:10.960]
We got to get out of this place remember that sure Eric burden and animals. That's correct

[01:24:12.180 --> 01:24:17.000]
We got to get on this place because there's too many people like you sir looking for a problem

[01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.900]
There's any problem you love the show. He just got through Sanio loves the show

[01:24:19.900 --> 01:24:23.080]
But why did you quit tearing up because I feel like it because it makes me feel good

[01:24:23.080 --> 01:24:30.040]
Okay, I rip it up with my own bare hands makes me feel real masculine. You know like a real man almost well closes all over again

[01:24:30.600 --> 01:24:31.040]
Schmuck

[01:24:31.700 --> 01:24:35.340]
There you go Eric burden in the animals man what a heavy bird we wear bear

[01:24:36.720 --> 01:24:38.180]
And who the fuck it to

[01:24:45.960 --> 01:24:51.820]
That's what the public wants to hear the house of the rising sun the animals man is this number one hit?

[01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:53.500]
I could believe this had to be number one

[01:24:54.160 --> 01:24:57.680]
60s are at 64 somewhere about back in that day 60

[01:24:58.680 --> 01:25:00.120]
4 like I said

[01:25:03.800 --> 01:25:08.880]
Not any more there is on first you know, okay, I sent a house to the rising sun w.q.a.m. Hello

[01:25:09.660 --> 01:25:16.420]
Ah, is this the Nelson Roger Balfour show. Yeah, what can we do for you sir? Yeah, I read an article on the internet about you

[01:25:16.420 --> 01:25:23.460]
What are you gonna start again with this crap? We're gonna get lost w.q.a.m. Hello. That's the guy with the work of media

[01:25:25.040 --> 01:25:26.900]
Hello, oh, good. You yes, sir

[01:25:26.900 --> 01:25:28.500]
How are you sir? Okay

[01:25:29.360 --> 01:25:32.740]
And gmp is like a true girl and she'll take your money for sex

[01:25:33.620 --> 01:25:34.020]
also

[01:25:35.400 --> 01:25:39.780]
Also, it's rainy in Miami, so if you can drive to the street, you know who you are

[01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:43.940]
In other words, everybody stay home

[01:25:44.740 --> 01:25:46.220]
Wow, that was very educational

[01:25:46.900 --> 01:25:48.640]
Yeah, the work of pd guy he's another one

[01:25:48.640 --> 01:25:52.300]
He's a good bullet between the ears. I was gonna say in the brain, but we couldn't find it

[01:25:52.300 --> 01:25:55.040]
Maybe just in his back home. Wtc.ym. Hello

[01:25:56.900 --> 01:25:57.260]
Yes, sir

[01:26:04.020 --> 01:26:07.820]
Humpty, yeah brutal

[01:26:08.340 --> 01:26:13.160]
Need to be they need to be shot a lot of shooting needs to be done, pali should be a capital fence and

[01:26:13.160 --> 01:26:19.360]
Real quick about pizza in Chicago. I'd say it's like what beach should I go to in Florida?

[01:26:19.580 --> 01:26:21.460]
Just look around a little bit and you'll be fine

[01:26:21.460 --> 01:26:24.980]
It's all good. It's all good. Okay, thanks pali

[01:26:24.980 --> 01:26:29.700]
Like bubble would say it's all good although. I think geodano is based on the thing I got on the from the guy in Utah

[01:26:29.700 --> 01:26:32.300]
And what I heard from a friend of mine who's a Chicago

[01:26:32.300 --> 01:26:34.160]
I wouldn't say expert, but knows it pretty well

[01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:37.660]
He said geodano is his great-ness probably why it's so busy there's lined up like 80

[01:26:37.660 --> 01:26:41.620]
You know the one thing about the Chicago pizza and I'm trying to think of what station I worked in

[01:26:42.820 --> 01:26:48.040]
Where we headed the they'll send it air express, you know, they put it in the with those what do they call those things?

[01:26:49.300 --> 01:26:55.200]
I give up friends. Huh? They call them Fred. They pack them on dry ice is what I'm trying. Oh, okay

[01:26:56.400 --> 01:27:01.920]
And we got I'm a thing with Sarah Soda like back in the 73 when I worked there WSP being we got a Chicago pizza

[01:27:02.840 --> 01:27:04.720]
delivered the air express like that

[01:27:05.980 --> 01:27:08.700]
And then there was some other stuff that we had was it the Chicago dogs

[01:27:08.700 --> 01:27:11.580]
I don't know some other food that we had shipped and it's damn good

[01:27:11.580 --> 01:27:17.040]
And if you go on the websites of all these places like Geno's East and Luma, Nadi's and geodanos most of those joints

[01:27:17.040 --> 01:27:18.940]
Will will ship them anywhere in the country?

[01:27:20.280 --> 01:27:24.160]
And so the fact that you're stuck like an ash debula or higher somewhere you're thinking oh gee

[01:27:24.160 --> 01:27:28.780]
I wish I had some of that reading good Chicago style pizza or whatever there are a lot of places like that that'll send you

[01:27:28.780 --> 01:27:29.180]
You know

[01:27:30.040 --> 01:27:34.920]
Just don't stick your hands in the dry ice. That's my best suggestion to you. Not a really good idea now put it on your tongue

[01:27:34.920 --> 01:27:36.760]
That's better. That's always the best

[01:27:37.720 --> 01:27:38.380]
WQAM hello

[01:27:40.180 --> 01:27:40.900]
WQAM hello

[01:27:41.300 --> 01:27:47.000]
Hey Neil I got a few cliches. Oh sure 20 or 30 would be good go. I got a couple of hours. So

[01:27:47.480 --> 01:27:54.060]
He's a real stand-up guy. You know stand-up guys are supposed to lay down guy right and the same my first time at the rodeo

[01:27:55.500 --> 01:27:59.800]
Never heard that one. Oh really? Okay. Don't go to the rodeo much do I guess not

[01:28:00.700 --> 01:28:02.040]
Smooth is a gravy sandwich

[01:28:03.040 --> 01:28:04.400]
A gravy sandwich

[01:28:05.080 --> 01:28:10.480]
Like that. Oh for me. Yeah, I love that and I picked a bad day

[01:28:10.900 --> 01:28:12.020]
To get up snorting crack

[01:28:14.800 --> 01:28:18.300]
Okay, I'm out of material. Yeah, sorry. Okay. Thank you. Some I'm glad I'm right at that point

[01:28:18.300 --> 01:28:19.960]
I think was just the right spot. Yeah

[01:28:20.660 --> 01:28:24.720]
Sometimes they push it a little bit too far. He knew exactly when to bail out when in that time to bail out

[01:28:25.140 --> 01:28:29.080]
Sound like he was reprising the airplane a bit that we played a little bit ago. Yeah, boy bridges

[01:28:30.640 --> 01:28:35.180]
Lloyd bridges is dead. How about some of the other people that are Peter Graves is still alive and doing those nice guy co-spots

[01:28:35.180 --> 01:28:37.940]
Oh, that's one of my very least favorite ones on tangerine

[01:28:37.940 --> 01:28:41.440]
I plan on some tangerine look lost and answer the door. I was one lucky woman

[01:28:41.440 --> 01:28:46.480]
I was unless you saw airplane you have no idea what that even means right

[01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:53.740]
Am I right? It is a tie-in. There's no question. Oh sure. He's reprising the same bag character that he was an airplane

[01:28:53.740 --> 01:28:55.520]
I was here growing man naked today. Right

[01:28:56.720 --> 01:28:58.100]
As a matter of fact

[01:28:58.740 --> 01:28:59.180]
Oh

[01:29:02.340 --> 01:29:04.840]
What's wrong with that they have it we all

[01:29:05.380 --> 01:29:06.500]
Yeah, you have

[01:29:07.480 --> 01:29:12.480]
Well, I'll be damn 957. Well, there was a guy would buy the other day. I swear to you

[01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:18.320]
And in this is disgusting tube he looked like he looked like a famous porn star

[01:29:18.320 --> 01:29:24.280]
And I say that turned very loosely who it loses after after losing an enormous amount of weight does that mean good or bad bad?

[01:29:24.680 --> 01:29:24.860]
Okay

[01:29:26.920 --> 01:29:31.640]
Ron Jeremy. He could have been his twin brother only a much a much smaller swimmer room

[01:29:31.640 --> 01:29:34.500]
I know and I did not ask whether it was double-jointed or whatever you know

[01:29:35.580 --> 01:29:40.960]
Oh my god there you talk about getting spilties talk about a guy who's definitely in the wrong career and just lucked out

[01:29:40.960 --> 01:29:43.040]
Anyway and still made a lot of money

[01:29:43.600 --> 01:29:45.940]
And as long as I live on ever forget that day

[01:29:46.460 --> 01:29:49.800]
He was so insulted because I said he was fat and hairy and disgusting

[01:29:49.800 --> 01:29:57.000]
Which I mean look in the mirror Ron you're fat and hairy and disgusting. Okay, so big deal. You're double-jointed. Congratulations. You know wow

[01:29:58.260 --> 01:30:01.540]
He was very insulted. I guess he considers himself a real stud

[01:30:01.540 --> 01:30:03.900]
I consider me

[01:30:03.900 --> 01:30:04.400]
DUD

[01:30:05.260 --> 01:30:11.420]
WQAM. Hello. Oh, hey Neil how you doing? Okay, sir. Sorry. This is already on there

[01:30:12.180 --> 01:30:16.380]
The gravy thing brought this to mind riding the gravy train

[01:30:16.860 --> 01:30:23.580]
What is that you didn't ever hear that? Yeah, we were talking about yesterday. It's so great. Mm-hmm. Delish

[01:30:23.580 --> 01:30:25.940]
I mean you can put on a sandwich if you want

[01:30:26.600 --> 01:30:28.780]
And you know another one we forgot because that guy's boring

[01:30:29.380 --> 01:30:32.120]
In the back of the salad days what right?

[01:30:32.420 --> 01:30:37.100]
About that yesterday forgot to put it on there though the salad days. Why I still don't understand that

[01:30:37.100 --> 01:30:39.500]
Yeah, I mean wouldn't you say the steak and potato day?

[01:30:39.700 --> 01:30:47.260]
About the salad salad days sounds lean and mean the mean and you know not to I don't know name something good like back in the pot roast days right

[01:30:48.240 --> 01:30:54.220]
Back in the shaft of beyond days or something like that back in the sirloin steak days when we had a lot of money and things are really great

[01:30:54.220 --> 01:30:57.400]
And we're on the gravy train or whatever now we're eating gravy train

[01:30:57.860 --> 01:31:01.020]
And if we stick with the this bunch of losers we got here a QM much longer

[01:31:01.020 --> 01:31:03.500]
We're gonna all be eating gravy train. I'm talking about Jolly

[01:31:04.400 --> 01:31:07.640]
How's he doing by the way? Is he come by to say higher or whatever? No lately

[01:31:08.640 --> 01:31:13.580]
Jolly Jersey Joe no no no no you told me how much he hates me. I guess he doesn't combine him. Oh wow

[01:31:13.980 --> 01:31:17.840]
He probably hates me too now because of the fact that I tell the truth and I talk about the fact that the

[01:31:17.840 --> 01:31:22.880]
The numbers are in the toilet now. What a phenomenal job. He's done. I think and of course that morning show

[01:31:22.880 --> 01:31:26.720]
I would I wouldn't be surprised if he and Clarence are both the architects of that and toast as well

[01:31:27.440 --> 01:31:30.320]
The aptly named one w.w.q.a.m. Hello

[01:31:32.100 --> 01:31:38.880]
George finally came out all right w.w.q.a.m. Hello. Yeah, I got up there for you. Yes sir not for nothing

[01:31:40.060 --> 01:31:43.480]
And you know what I'm saying? You know what I'm saying now in that already on

[01:31:43.480 --> 01:31:47.580]
Yeah, we have a long time ago not to read all these because there's only about 40,000 of them

[01:31:47.580 --> 01:31:50.620]
I could read the whole poll once and we'd be done. That's an idea. That's a thought

[01:31:51.360 --> 01:31:54.480]
Now what was the first one he said not for nothing which not for nothing

[01:31:54.480 --> 01:31:58.020]
I hear it a lot. I don't really understand what it means. It's like GFE

[01:31:59.880 --> 01:32:03.400]

And say that when number one, top of the heat, we can't be beat.

[01:35:23.780 --> 01:35:32.600]
Again we have one who's thought bombing our land.

[01:35:34.720 --> 01:35:39.240]
Why not start to save you?

[01:35:40.920 --> 01:35:46.460]
Let's make your party lot of best.

[01:35:47.780 --> 01:35:53.000]
And hold our breath.

[01:35:53.000 --> 01:36:07.360]
And when all the boys are there, I'll do a show with that sick chair and save good vibes.

[01:36:08.020 --> 01:36:20.740]
I'm right, I'm right, I'm right, who's heaven heads.

[01:36:21.860 --> 01:36:23.060]
Bang bang, you're dead.

[01:36:26.580 --> 01:36:30.780]
Did anybody ever attempt Josh Cortes on the back of the head and say, hey, there's no stories on here.

[01:36:30.880 --> 01:36:31.600]
There's no bedtime stories.

[01:36:31.640 --> 01:36:32.880]
Which I sent him a whole bunch yesterday.

[01:36:33.020 --> 01:36:34.560]
He gave me a song and an insight into the cinema.

[01:36:34.560 --> 01:36:36.020]
But my old time was in that band.

[01:36:36.620 --> 01:36:38.160]
He's either in a meeting or not here.

[01:36:38.660 --> 01:36:39.000]
He's why?

[01:36:39.400 --> 01:36:40.640]
Either in a meeting or not here.

[01:36:41.680 --> 01:36:42.380]
Wasn't that great?

[01:36:43.280 --> 01:36:44.020]
Well, that's okay.

[01:36:44.140 --> 01:36:45.300]
Listen, that's the QAM exercise.

[01:36:45.600 --> 01:36:47.540]
He's too busy and practically irrelevant at the composite.

[01:36:47.540 --> 01:36:49.000]
He's a damn little head and send a check.

[01:36:50.720 --> 01:36:52.080]
That's the laughing button, but it's true.

[01:36:52.260 --> 01:36:55.980]
I mean, why not help when I send a check when I send like, you know, 15, 20 important stories.

[01:36:56.200 --> 01:36:57.320]
And there's nothing on there.

[01:36:57.740 --> 01:37:01.460]
And our vast audience out there is like going back again and again.

[01:37:01.540 --> 01:37:03.580]
Where is the stuff we're supposed to read today?

[01:37:03.680 --> 01:37:06.520]
We're all those intellectual stories for all those egg heads out here.

[01:37:07.460 --> 01:37:10.500]
Scott in Pinellas Park says he said, by the way, Pinellas Park is the only place

[01:37:10.500 --> 01:37:11.760]
that could make Tamrak look good.

[01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:12.760]
Excellent point, Scott.

[01:37:13.400 --> 01:37:13.940]
A few more.

[01:37:14.080 --> 01:37:15.360]
It's a win-win situation.

[01:37:16.280 --> 01:37:20.360]
From the get-go, he or she is a partial stranger.

[01:37:21.860 --> 01:37:22.780]
Yeah, that's interesting.

[01:37:23.640 --> 01:37:24.500]
A partial stranger.

[01:37:24.900 --> 01:37:26.380]
He or she's no day at the beach.

[01:37:27.720 --> 01:37:30.800]
And it says the toll fee numbers are working if you're calling from the 727 area code.

[01:37:31.080 --> 01:37:34.360]
Well, that's a record of Scott that will teach you to live in the 727 area code.

[01:37:34.480 --> 01:37:34.920]
Don't do it again.

[01:37:35.420 --> 01:37:36.540]
But here's my very favorite.

[01:37:36.700 --> 01:37:41.300]
It's from Dave, who says, add this to your dumbest expressions poll.

[01:37:41.300 --> 01:37:42.420]
This is my favorite.

[01:37:42.480 --> 01:37:46.560]
We're not going to put this one on there, but this is, nothing is even close.

[01:37:47.260 --> 01:37:47.860]
You want to hear it?

[01:37:48.080 --> 01:37:48.240]
Ready?

[01:37:48.900 --> 01:37:51.060]
Robert Creeper, the grim reaper and the Lord of the Board.

[01:37:52.480 --> 01:37:53.300]
Nice going, Dave.

[01:37:55.440 --> 01:37:58.440]
I mean, I just nausea inducing.

[01:37:58.520 --> 01:38:00.160]
It's just puke inducing, you know.

[01:38:02.600 --> 01:38:05.360]
56670560, pound 560, and leave a rise in singular wireless line.

[01:38:05.480 --> 01:38:06.480]
Proaching a thousand out of that.

[01:38:07.340 --> 01:38:09.180]
We're making our approach right now.

[01:38:09.180 --> 01:38:10.260]
We're going to be landing any second.

[01:38:10.980 --> 01:38:11.780]
975 votes.

[01:38:12.140 --> 01:38:14.240]
And of course, you know, it will be a soft landing on the show.

[01:38:14.640 --> 01:38:15.280]
Dominic Q.A.N.

[01:38:15.360 --> 01:38:15.500]
Hello.

[01:38:16.060 --> 01:38:20.220]
With that Lord of the Board spelled D-O-A-R-D or D-O-R-E-D.

[01:38:20.260 --> 01:38:21.300]
D-O-R-E-D, yeah.

[01:38:21.420 --> 01:38:22.220]
Board of the Board.

[01:38:22.220 --> 01:38:22.220]

[01:38:22.220 --> 01:38:22.860]
I'm going to either way.

[01:38:23.280 --> 01:38:25.300]
Listen, I have the opposite of this.

[01:38:25.440 --> 01:38:28.380]
I think the greatest expression has come into modern usage.

[01:38:28.840 --> 01:38:29.020]
Yeah.

[01:38:29.120 --> 01:38:30.420]
I'm sure that George will agree with me.

[01:38:31.020 --> 01:38:32.360]
Friends with benefits.

[01:38:33.420 --> 01:38:34.340]
Friends with benefits.

[01:38:34.340 --> 01:38:36.000]
That's a good expression when you get it.

[01:38:36.480 --> 01:38:38.120]
Because the renders marriage obsolete.

[01:38:38.820 --> 01:38:39.220]
Amen.

[01:38:39.620 --> 01:38:40.760]
Amen to that, sir.

[01:38:41.320 --> 01:38:42.020]
You're holding weekend.

[01:38:42.500 --> 01:38:42.920]
And you too.

[01:38:43.020 --> 01:38:45.560]
Have a lovely weekend and a lovely life, wife, life.

[01:38:47.500 --> 01:38:51.280]
56670560, pound 560, and leave a rise in singular wireless line.

[01:38:51.340 --> 01:38:53.840]
Don't forget, join the QM Street team right now till 2 o'clock.

[01:38:54.660 --> 01:38:58.660]
At the Verizon Wireless Store at 100th South Viscayne Boulevard in downtown Miami, the QM Street team.

[01:38:58.660 --> 01:39:00.540]
Maybe George Cordis is down there on the street.

[01:39:00.940 --> 01:39:01.360]
He ought to be.

[01:39:01.920 --> 01:39:04.100]
Stop buying when prices get autographs from the heat dancers.

[01:39:04.100 --> 01:39:07.120]
No stories on our website today, George Cordis.

[01:39:07.380 --> 01:39:08.420]
I just mentioned that in passing.

[01:39:08.840 --> 01:39:11.640]
And that check that was just, oh man, it was like writing my hand in all of a sudden.

[01:39:12.060 --> 01:39:12.200]
Oh.

[01:39:12.740 --> 01:39:13.100]
Oh.

[01:39:13.620 --> 01:39:14.760]
Remember that guy I called before?

[01:39:15.160 --> 01:39:15.760]
Oh, I know.

[01:39:15.780 --> 01:39:16.640]
I'm never a thing of stories.

[01:39:16.800 --> 01:39:17.060]
Don't worry.

[01:39:17.740 --> 01:39:18.640]
I'm shredding those.

[01:39:20.420 --> 01:39:21.060]
WQAM, hello.

[01:39:21.620 --> 01:39:22.380]
Here, good afternoon.

[01:39:22.820 --> 01:39:23.200]
Yes, sir.

[01:39:23.300 --> 01:39:24.060]
Good afternoon, dear sir.

[01:39:24.660 --> 01:39:28.780]
We don't need any new articles on the web because we know you'll read them all on the air.

[01:39:28.980 --> 01:39:29.280]
Here.

[01:39:29.720 --> 01:39:33.280]
There was a, that's probably George's boyfriend.

[01:39:33.660 --> 01:39:34.080]
WQAM has a lot of things to do with the web.

[01:39:34.080 --> 01:39:34.520]
Hello.

[01:39:34.780 --> 01:39:35.780]
Yeah, can I come in?

[01:39:36.320 --> 01:39:36.720]
Speaking.

[01:39:39.260 --> 01:39:39.660]
Speaking.

[01:39:40.260 --> 01:39:40.840]
Yeah, hey.

[01:39:41.160 --> 01:39:43.980]
Just for a day, I have done this expression.

[01:39:44.240 --> 01:39:45.380]
That's the way they're kicking crumbles.

[01:39:45.800 --> 01:39:47.100]
Yeah, that's not good.

[01:39:47.900 --> 01:39:48.340]
No, get it.

[01:39:48.640 --> 01:39:49.260]
I don't think so.

[01:39:49.700 --> 01:39:51.120]
So he can crackers in there, man.

[01:39:51.200 --> 01:39:51.980]
Not a good idea.

[01:39:54.100 --> 01:39:56.000]
Kind of like the sums up this business.

[01:39:56.160 --> 01:39:56.680]
Too many crumbs.

[01:39:58.140 --> 01:39:59.240]
Summers up pretty well to me.

[01:39:59.780 --> 01:40:02.560]
5.67.05.60 and 0.05.60 in the Verizon.

[01:40:02.880 --> 01:40:04.060]
Remember what I said before about people who are not in the industry.

[01:40:04.060 --> 01:40:04.060]

[01:40:04.060 --> 01:40:04.060]

[01:40:04.060 --> 01:40:04.060]

[01:40:04.060 --> 01:40:04.060]

[01:40:04.060 --> 01:40:04.060]

[01:40:04.060 --> 01:40:05.120]
People who think that they're very funny.

[01:40:05.320 --> 01:40:06.380]
Like Bill Marip, for example.

[01:40:07.300 --> 01:40:09.600]
When that guy called me for instance, did we get Bill Marip here in Canada?

[01:40:09.940 --> 01:40:11.380]
No, he's banned at the border, pal.

[01:40:11.840 --> 01:40:13.960]
B-O-B, banned on the border.

[01:40:15.680 --> 01:40:18.440]
Man, twerp, giving the word twerp, new definition.

[01:40:18.640 --> 01:40:21.740]
And when he was sucking up, because he's got around his show all the time, and coders.

[01:40:21.760 --> 01:40:23.160]
See, there's a man of no principles whatsoever.

[01:40:23.360 --> 01:40:23.500]
Right.

[01:40:24.060 --> 01:40:27.600]
He pretends to be this great liberal and this great anti-right wing hero.

[01:40:27.940 --> 01:40:32.180]
And then, but the hillkiss and coders ass has grotesque and nauseating as a thought may be,

[01:40:32.180 --> 01:40:34.220]
because she's a guest on the show all the time.

[01:40:35.180 --> 01:40:38.220]
Oh, yeah, I'll have her back, and I don't have always agreed with what she's saying.

[01:40:38.420 --> 01:40:40.700]
And then, oh, what a simple whim.

[01:40:41.420 --> 01:40:44.080]
I think he ought to well open the rubber creeper to the Lord of the Bordon, Mia.

[01:40:45.200 --> 01:40:45.840]
WQAM, hello.

[01:40:48.420 --> 01:40:49.060]
WQAM, hello.

[01:40:50.560 --> 01:40:52.880]
Yeah, how about hello, these lucks.

[01:40:54.440 --> 01:40:55.160]
WQAM, hello.

[01:40:55.780 --> 01:40:56.500]
Anyhow, how's it going?

[01:40:56.760 --> 01:40:57.220]
Okay, sir.

[01:40:57.900 --> 01:41:01.560]
I've noticed that you guys for a couple of years now, and I've never really felt your pain when you say this.

[01:41:01.560 --> 01:41:06.080]
My amy's bad and self-ported is bad as much as I did last night when I went to the youth fair.

[01:41:06.400 --> 01:41:10.380]
And the people there, man, terrible, terrible, terrible, and I'm talking about like,

[01:41:10.740 --> 01:41:13.000]
even older people also, you know, not just the young kids.

[01:41:13.060 --> 01:41:14.100]
You want even older ones?

[01:41:14.120 --> 01:41:15.320]
Yeah, most, mostly older people.

[01:41:15.660 --> 01:41:18.840]
Yeah, the 30s, the 30-year-olds, when it is, and I'm 24 years old.

[01:41:18.980 --> 01:41:20.720]
I'm not 40 or 50 or 60 complaining.

[01:41:20.960 --> 01:41:21.680]
I'm a young guy.

[01:41:22.040 --> 01:41:22.220]
Yeah.

[01:41:22.400 --> 01:41:27.400]
And the people down here are just, I don't know what they think of themselves, are they looking for something mirror?

[01:41:27.700 --> 01:41:29.020]
And it's just sad, it's sad, man.

[01:41:29.420 --> 01:41:29.780]
What?

[01:41:30.140 --> 01:41:31.120]
Tell me about it.

[01:41:31.420 --> 01:41:31.980]
Good over, Neil.

[01:41:32.060 --> 01:41:32.420]
I'm moving in.

[01:41:33.120 --> 01:41:33.700]
Okay, see you.

[01:41:34.320 --> 01:41:35.180]
Send a picture, pal.

[01:41:36.500 --> 01:41:40.860]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 in the horizon, see you at a wireless line.

[01:41:40.940 --> 01:41:42.560]
I guess I'll give a quick rundown.

[01:41:42.780 --> 01:41:44.500]
Okay, I'll say one thing.

[01:41:44.900 --> 01:41:46.400]
We haven't had a whole lot of repeats like usual.

[01:41:47.280 --> 01:41:48.420]
980 votes on the poll.

[01:41:48.640 --> 01:41:52.020]
The dumbest expression that people say is, I hate this poll is down to an even 20%.

[01:41:52.560 --> 01:41:53.820]
We got a shot at getting under that.

[01:41:54.200 --> 01:41:54.560]
196.

[01:41:55.480 --> 01:41:56.180]
That's scandalous.

[01:41:56.960 --> 01:41:59.860]
Two shakes of a lamb's tail, 125, a pig in a poke 84.

[01:42:00.340 --> 01:42:01.900]
Never stole a freight train, 76.

[01:42:02.100 --> 01:42:02.880]
That's one of my favorites.

[01:42:03.900 --> 01:42:05.100]
In a coons' age, 70.

[01:42:05.320 --> 01:42:06.480]
I don't want to be saying that.

[01:42:07.080 --> 01:42:08.400]
Look at these split, 67.

[01:42:10.100 --> 01:42:10.520]
Mm-hmm.

[01:42:11.460 --> 01:42:12.660]
Feather in your cap, 49.

[01:42:12.920 --> 01:42:14.000]
That is a door nail, 48.

[01:42:14.300 --> 01:42:15.860]
I never heard of the dumb expression, 43.

[01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:17.500]
Where you must not get out of the house too much, I guess.

[01:42:18.340 --> 01:42:20.500]
First time, Paula, long time listed, 23.

[01:42:20.760 --> 01:42:21.620]
I despise that.

[01:42:21.900 --> 01:42:22.500]
You know what I mean?

[01:42:22.940 --> 01:42:23.260]
23.

[01:42:24.040 --> 01:42:25.200]
Dumbest dirt, 21.

[01:42:25.520 --> 01:42:26.640]
As the crow flies, 16.

[01:42:27.220 --> 01:42:28.420]
But my whistle, 16.

[01:42:29.500 --> 01:42:30.960]
In your heart of hearts, 15.

[01:42:31.340 --> 01:42:32.360]
Back in the day, 15.

[01:42:32.540 --> 01:42:33.720]
At the end of the day, 14.

[01:42:34.320 --> 01:42:35.680]
A hop-skip at a jump, 13.

[01:42:36.320 --> 01:42:37.560]
You go, girl, 12.

[01:42:38.580 --> 01:42:39.600]
Walk off home, run 8.

[01:42:39.760 --> 01:42:41.140]
See, we should do this force one separate.

[01:42:43.080 --> 01:42:45.040]
Uh, I'll hang up and listen, 8.

[01:42:45.740 --> 01:42:47.340]
He died an untimely death, 7.

[01:42:47.580 --> 01:42:48.760]
As sharp as a marble, 7.

[01:42:49.080 --> 01:42:50.980]
Thanks for taking my call, 7.

[01:42:52.600 --> 01:42:54.540]
You shouldn't, uh, Schmidt, were you we?

[01:42:54.840 --> 01:42:55.080]
Three.

[01:42:56.200 --> 01:42:57.260]
Who'd have funcated three?

[01:42:57.560 --> 01:42:58.320]
Make it snappy three.

[01:42:58.380 --> 01:42:58.900]
Who invented that?

[01:42:58.960 --> 01:43:00.460]
You shouldn't, wasn't that Greg Reed who said that?

[01:43:00.680 --> 01:43:01.400]
Don't Schmidt, were you we?

[01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:02.560]
I don't know.

[01:43:03.120 --> 01:43:04.080]
Make it snappy three.

[01:43:04.240 --> 01:43:05.000]
Good to go with three.

[01:43:05.800 --> 01:43:07.140]
It is what it is, too.

[01:43:07.560 --> 01:43:08.700]
Pack your patients, too.

[01:43:09.340 --> 01:43:11.400]
A lot of packing going out, I'll tell you that right now.

[01:43:11.640 --> 01:43:13.680]
In the next two, not for nothing one.

[01:43:14.060 --> 01:43:15.160]
Have your cake and eat it, too, one.

[01:43:15.220 --> 01:43:16.680]
I think Al Pacino said that several times.

[01:43:16.980 --> 01:43:19.840]
What is that bunch of, uh, sex offender with his parents?

[01:43:19.840 --> 01:43:20.320]
The family?

[01:43:20.620 --> 01:43:21.660]
Oh, filled that little kid.

[01:43:22.040 --> 01:43:22.680]
Uh, it's just sick.

[01:43:22.960 --> 01:43:23.540]
Really sick.

[01:43:24.060 --> 01:43:27.520]
I think they ought to take the whole family and execute them on the NBC nightly news.

[01:43:28.440 --> 01:43:30.760]
No votes for win-win situation is the Pope Catholic.

[01:43:30.760 --> 01:43:32.340]
I heard that.

[01:43:32.520 --> 01:43:35.300]
Hot to trot by hooker by crook, airfew in my shoes.

[01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:36.600]
No votes yet.

[01:43:36.820 --> 01:43:37.520]
Out of 93.

[01:43:38.420 --> 01:43:40.840]
So this half hour Chris will go over a thousand an hour to spare.

[01:43:40.980 --> 01:43:43.560]
Or we can replace him in a Marlins game for me, as they would be there.

[01:43:43.940 --> 01:43:44.400]
Sounds good.

[01:43:45.220 --> 01:43:45.940]
Did they win?

[01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:48.120]
Uh, I think so.

[01:43:48.480 --> 01:43:48.640]
No.

[01:43:48.640 --> 01:43:49.700]
And does anybody care?

[01:43:49.800 --> 01:43:49.900]
No.

[01:43:50.020 --> 01:43:50.760]
Even they don't care.

[01:43:51.900 --> 01:43:53.480]
27 past noon at QM time.

[01:43:53.740 --> 01:43:55.380]
Try the U.S.

[01:43:55.780 --> 01:43:56.460]
Doors.

[01:44:04.600 --> 01:44:08.060]
Who was a little baby father of fight?

[01:44:09.100 --> 01:44:09.780]
Cooking.

[01:44:10.740 --> 01:44:12.580]
One of a dozen guys.

[01:44:12.900 --> 01:44:15.820]
It may be the other hour of service.

[01:44:16.340 --> 01:44:17.500]
Did you get frost?

[01:44:18.500 --> 01:44:20.180]
That was that frozen sperm.

[01:44:20.620 --> 01:44:21.460]
There it is.

[01:44:21.460 --> 01:44:23.280]
Burkets as he is a dad.

[01:44:23.900 --> 01:44:25.060]
He shot down.

[01:44:25.880 --> 01:44:27.740]
Your husband has been bad.

[01:44:28.200 --> 01:44:31.200]
Look like none of them will budge you.

[01:44:31.960 --> 01:44:35.200]
It'll be up to that crazy judge.

[01:44:35.540 --> 01:44:37.300]
Who can it be now?

[01:44:38.700 --> 01:44:41.160]
Return any pass now.

[01:44:42.880 --> 01:44:44.900]
Who is the dad now?

[01:44:50.120 --> 01:44:52.180]
Who can it be now?

[01:44:52.180 --> 01:44:52.320]
Who can it be now?

[01:44:52.440 --> 01:44:52.440]

[01:44:55.260 --> 01:44:56.260]
1232-560-W.

[01:44:56.440 --> 01:44:57.340]
Here's another one.

[01:44:57.980 --> 01:44:58.380]
There's no look.

[01:44:58.580 --> 01:44:58.960]
Now let's see.

[01:44:59.060 --> 01:44:59.900]
19.7%.

[01:45:00.480 --> 01:45:01.020]
Let's hear it.

[01:45:01.040 --> 01:45:02.240]
We got 120%.

[01:45:02.240 --> 01:45:03.480]
We started out with like what?

[01:45:03.980 --> 01:45:05.260]
89% or something.

[01:45:05.360 --> 01:45:05.880]
They hated it.

[01:45:06.520 --> 01:45:07.700]
Too much hate down there.

[01:45:07.820 --> 01:45:08.320]
Stop hating.

[01:45:08.600 --> 01:45:10.940]
Reach out and tap somebody under the shoulder and say,

[01:45:11.240 --> 01:45:12.160]
I love you.

[01:45:12.300 --> 01:45:13.160]
Or just live.

[01:45:13.800 --> 01:45:15.520]
Let me go out in the hall to do that.

[01:45:15.780 --> 01:45:17.300]
Go out in the hall and grab somebody.

[01:45:17.640 --> 01:45:19.160]
Go get Tommy and kiss him on the cheek.

[01:45:19.300 --> 01:45:19.920]
Say, I love you Tommy.

[01:45:20.100 --> 01:45:21.460]
He'll smack you on.

[01:45:22.440 --> 01:45:23.020]
Rich says,

[01:45:23.580 --> 01:45:24.300]
but you just relax.

[01:45:24.540 --> 01:45:24.900]
Rich says,

[01:45:25.080 --> 01:45:26.580]
Fubruckers are still around a date county.

[01:45:26.900 --> 01:45:28.280]
See if he's been more time a date county,

[01:45:28.340 --> 01:45:29.560]
you'd find out what's really going on.

[01:45:29.780 --> 01:45:30.480]
You're talking about me?

[01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:31.220]
Yeah.

[01:45:31.780 --> 01:45:32.620]
Well Chris lives there.

[01:45:32.700 --> 01:45:33.140]
He ought to know.

[01:45:33.440 --> 01:45:34.100]
He doesn't know.

[01:45:34.200 --> 01:45:34.700]
He thinks a guy,

[01:45:34.960 --> 01:45:36.300]
although he shouldn't know where the food is though.

[01:45:37.120 --> 01:45:39.180]
It says it's in the roundness to the international mall.

[01:45:39.360 --> 01:45:40.860]
Sonic is also in the date county still.

[01:45:41.620 --> 01:45:42.620]
See if he's going to date county.

[01:45:42.620 --> 01:45:43.440]
He'd find the good stuff.

[01:45:44.480 --> 01:45:47.720]
Finally, there's also a Godfather's Pizza inside a head station on bird road

[01:45:47.720 --> 01:45:48.780]
next to Tammy and me Park.

[01:45:49.220 --> 01:45:49.780]
So how do you like that?

[01:45:51.120 --> 01:45:51.620]
And of course the Godfather's.

[01:45:52.320 --> 01:45:54.520]
Which I know we asked the one on the baby road extension.

[01:45:56.040 --> 01:45:56.940]
In a head station,

[01:45:57.020 --> 01:45:59.240]
I think that was the first head station that had the Godfather's.

[01:45:59.240 --> 01:46:01.420]
Remember they came by a couple times and they brought us pizza.

[01:46:01.740 --> 01:46:02.080]
Remember that?

[01:46:02.140 --> 01:46:02.280]
Oh.

[01:46:03.220 --> 01:46:05.660]
And the pizza doesn't really travel all that well as you know.

[01:46:05.920 --> 01:46:07.340]
I mean traditional style does,

[01:46:07.460 --> 01:46:09.860]
but I'm talking about that kind of thick, the thick kind.

[01:46:11.060 --> 01:46:11.600]
Like steak.

[01:46:11.600 --> 01:46:13.380]
Steak doesn't travel well.

[01:46:13.500 --> 01:46:14.140]
It's going to be on the year.

[01:46:14.480 --> 01:46:17.000]
Although over the years I guess we've had people brought us in steak.

[01:46:17.360 --> 01:46:19.480]
And then there was always Smith and Wolensky came here.

[01:46:20.220 --> 01:46:20.440]
I'm sorry.

[01:46:20.440 --> 01:46:20.580]
I'm sorry.

[01:46:20.580 --> 01:46:21.980]
It's not go there speaking of expression.

[01:46:23.700 --> 01:46:24.060]
Oh.

[01:46:25.720 --> 01:46:26.900]
Don't even go there.

[01:46:27.080 --> 01:46:27.420]
I like that.

[01:46:27.540 --> 01:46:28.520]
I like to hate that one.

[01:46:28.580 --> 01:46:29.480]
That's one of my least favorites.

[01:46:29.660 --> 01:46:30.380]
Don't even go there.

[01:46:30.960 --> 01:46:31.300]
Oh.

[01:46:31.580 --> 01:46:31.780]
Brother.

[01:46:33.720 --> 01:46:34.880]
So Godfather's is still around,

[01:46:34.900 --> 01:46:35.920]
but not like the original one.

[01:46:36.040 --> 01:46:36.300]
No.

[01:46:36.700 --> 01:46:37.720]
That was so good.

[01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:39.840]
Especially that one on sunset with my buddy Javier.

[01:46:40.260 --> 01:46:41.580]
Hey Javier, come over here and sit down.

[01:46:41.580 --> 01:46:42.020]
I'm not going to sit down with my lamb.

[01:46:44.460 --> 01:46:47.080]
Well I sure wonder if he went to the Pokey with the rest of the family.

[01:46:47.720 --> 01:46:49.500]
But he was a popular guy in Nero if he did.

[01:46:50.180 --> 01:46:51.920]
Here's one from Ed in Fort Lauderdale.

[01:46:52.060 --> 01:46:52.980]
He says as Nercupon.

[01:46:54.280 --> 01:46:54.980]
I love it.

[01:46:54.980 --> 01:46:55.340]
That was good.

[01:46:55.600 --> 01:46:56.460]
Not getting ahead of myself.

[01:46:56.960 --> 01:46:57.580]
As Nercupon.

[01:46:57.840 --> 01:46:58.160]
I'm right.

[01:46:59.360 --> 01:47:01.660]
As Nervus as a Forky Pine in a Balloon Factory.

[01:47:01.980 --> 01:47:02.700]
That is cute.

[01:47:04.360 --> 01:47:04.900]
Isn't that cute?

[01:47:05.420 --> 01:47:05.860]
Yes it is.

[01:47:06.100 --> 01:47:08.920]
Nervus as a Forky Pine in a Balloon Factory.

[01:47:11.340 --> 01:47:12.340]
You know what I'm looking for?

[01:47:12.480 --> 01:47:12.620]
I can.

[01:47:13.040 --> 01:47:15.220]
That's probably just about not going to find it.

[01:47:15.220 --> 01:47:16.300]
I'm not going to put that on there.

[01:47:16.400 --> 01:47:16.640]
I'm sure.

[01:47:17.260 --> 01:47:18.480]
Because that's, hey it's cute.

[01:47:18.660 --> 01:47:19.560]
But who the hell ever heard of that?

[01:47:19.600 --> 01:47:20.340]
Anybody ever heard that?

[01:47:20.440 --> 01:47:20.520]
No.

[01:47:20.820 --> 01:47:21.260]
Anybody ever say that?

[01:47:21.260 --> 01:47:21.380]
No.

[01:47:21.580 --> 01:47:21.700]
No.

[01:47:23.360 --> 01:47:25.060]
I think we're approaching a thousand on the pole.

[01:47:25.220 --> 01:47:25.520]
Get ready.

[01:47:25.740 --> 01:47:27.280]
Get ready for a real exciting moment here.

[01:47:27.820 --> 01:47:28.320]
9.97.

[01:47:28.800 --> 01:47:29.080]
Uh oh.

[01:47:29.620 --> 01:47:30.060]
Uh oh.

[01:47:30.060 --> 01:47:30.060]

[01:47:30.140 --> 01:47:31.540]
See I didn't want to let that thing go all the way through.

[01:47:31.960 --> 01:47:32.900]
Little just a-

[01:47:32.900 --> 01:47:34.000]
Oh no, that wasn't good.

[01:47:34.720 --> 01:47:35.220]
Try it again.

[01:47:36.560 --> 01:47:37.260]
Okay that was good.

[01:47:37.260 --> 01:47:38.060]
About a half a bomb.

[01:47:39.420 --> 01:47:41.220]
Which Georgia's half a bomb is better than known.

[01:47:41.300 --> 01:47:41.740]
That's what you were.

[01:47:41.980 --> 01:47:42.120]
That's right.

[01:47:42.200 --> 01:47:42.620]
But nevertheless.

[01:47:43.180 --> 01:47:44.580]
5.6705.60.

[01:47:44.800 --> 01:47:45.440]
Pound 5.60.

[01:47:45.680 --> 01:47:46.500]
Levy rise in singular.

[01:47:46.960 --> 01:47:47.740]
Wireless line.

[01:47:49.020 --> 01:47:49.420]
WDQAM.

[01:47:49.540 --> 01:47:49.700]
Hello.

[01:47:50.520 --> 01:47:50.920]
Hello.

[01:47:51.420 --> 01:47:51.920]
Yes sir.

[01:47:52.680 --> 01:47:53.980]
How about Gitter Dunn?

[01:47:54.700 --> 01:47:55.160]
Gitter Dunn.

[01:47:55.520 --> 01:47:55.540]
Gitter Dunn.

[01:47:56.220 --> 01:47:56.820]
Yeah get it done.

[01:47:56.980 --> 01:47:57.760]
Okay get it done.

[01:47:58.340 --> 01:47:58.880]
Okay you're done.

[01:48:02.360 --> 01:48:03.260]
How are you spelling?

[01:48:03.760 --> 01:48:04.460]
Who the fuck it?

[01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:06.860]
He's calling Eater.

[01:48:08.100 --> 01:48:09.400]
Oh man, not to that Chris.

[01:48:09.600 --> 01:48:11.380]
It goes to show the fact people are the funny people.

[01:48:11.520 --> 01:48:12.240]
You know just look at him.

[01:48:12.320 --> 01:48:12.560]
You're laugh.

[01:48:13.020 --> 01:48:14.340]
Now seriously he's funny guy.

[01:48:14.400 --> 01:48:15.800]
Don't realize you're funny yet but you'll see.

[01:48:16.240 --> 01:48:17.920]
He's funny looking so he's halfway there.

[01:48:18.260 --> 01:48:23.720]
Oh now that's because that was a gratuitously it was honest of course but it was gratuitously nasty in the inventory.

[01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:24.600]
Yeah what would you do then?

[01:48:24.720 --> 01:48:26.000]
He hasn't sought me out yet.

[01:48:26.280 --> 01:48:27.240]
He's feeling bad about that.

[01:48:27.280 --> 01:48:29.820]
He doesn't have a hot girlfriend to come in here and give me a handful ass.

[01:48:29.940 --> 01:48:31.280]
How do you know he doesn't have a hot girlfriend?

[01:48:31.740 --> 01:48:32.180]
Trust me.

[01:48:32.580 --> 01:48:33.580]
Are you seeing his girlfriend?

[01:48:33.720 --> 01:48:34.940]
I haven't seen no of course not.

[01:48:35.060 --> 01:48:36.280]
If he had I'd seen her by now.

[01:48:36.620 --> 01:48:38.060]
You know what that would be like.

[01:48:38.200 --> 01:48:44.380]
It would be like somebody showing you a baby picture and you say you know proud father or mother just had a baby.

[01:48:45.160 --> 01:48:47.940]
And you say gee that's the ugliest baby I've ever seen in my life.

[01:48:48.020 --> 01:48:49.220]
He's just not going to do that.

[01:48:49.300 --> 01:48:49.700]
No you're not.

[01:48:50.200 --> 01:48:52.400]
So the fact that you're saying he doesn't have a hot girlfriend.

[01:48:52.580 --> 01:48:53.100]
How do you know?

[01:48:53.200 --> 01:48:53.960]
Because he doesn't have any.

[01:48:54.760 --> 01:48:57.600]
That's how he said the other day he said he was like working on one.

[01:48:57.840 --> 01:48:59.200]
I think I know what he yeah he's working on it.

[01:48:59.580 --> 01:49:00.160]
I think I know what he knew.

[01:49:00.160 --> 01:49:01.320]
He's got a lot of somebody closes the deal.

[01:49:01.360 --> 01:49:02.080]
Do you have any Q.A.M.

[01:49:02.120 --> 01:49:03.020]
How about closes the deal?

[01:49:05.120 --> 01:49:05.840]
Yes sir.

[01:49:06.520 --> 01:49:07.000]
How's he on?

[01:49:07.440 --> 01:49:07.680]
Great.

[01:49:08.440 --> 01:49:09.400]
How about that loose?

[01:49:09.740 --> 01:49:10.280]
How does it loose?

[01:49:12.740 --> 01:49:12.900]
It's a loose.

[01:49:12.900 --> 01:49:13.420]
And it could loose.

[01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:14.920]
Okay this is a loose.

[01:49:16.460 --> 01:49:20.540]
He sounds like he was getting tickled by that like with the feather.

[01:49:20.900 --> 01:49:22.440]
Like with the goose feather or goose down.

[01:49:22.660 --> 01:49:23.380]
What is goose down?

[01:49:24.400 --> 01:49:25.620]
You know how they make goose down?

[01:49:25.740 --> 01:49:25.820]
Do they make goose down?

[01:49:25.820 --> 01:49:29.780]
Do they make goose down?

[01:49:29.780 --> 01:49:30.280]
Oh my hands.

[01:49:30.660 --> 01:49:30.840]
Oh my hands.

[01:49:30.840 --> 01:49:31.460]
Oh my hands.

[01:49:31.580 --> 01:49:32.600]
Is the feathers from the needle?

[01:49:32.800 --> 01:49:33.760]
998 in the pole.

[01:49:34.440 --> 01:49:35.620]
No, see you shouldn't do that.

[01:49:35.940 --> 01:49:36.300]
No, yeah.

[01:49:36.820 --> 01:49:38.400]
Don't cut your chickens before they had.

[01:49:38.520 --> 01:49:39.640]
That's another stupid expression.

[01:49:40.500 --> 01:49:43.780]
You know this this pool today even there is a lot of stupid crap on here.

[01:49:44.100 --> 01:49:53.380]
It makes it makes you realize how conditioned we are that so much of our lives at least verbally is spent exchanging stupid ass expressions that we hear and we get we get hooked with them you know.

[01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:55.920]
And just keeps saying I'm over and over again.

[01:49:56.820 --> 01:49:57.540]
Am I correct?

[01:49:57.540 --> 01:50:00.120]
I think absolutely correct.

[01:50:00.360 --> 01:50:04.320]
But Robert Greeper the alluring of the board the schmuck of the puck.

[01:50:05.180 --> 01:50:06.660]
He's he's the then that one is it.

[01:50:06.800 --> 01:50:07.480]
Thanks a lot Dave.

[01:50:07.820 --> 01:50:11.160]
And the guy's name is Dave Ryder not not really the Dave Ryder radio Dave Ryder.

[01:50:11.580 --> 01:50:12.560]
I wonder if he's still alive.

[01:50:12.960 --> 01:50:13.500]
I don't know.

[01:50:13.800 --> 01:50:17.160]
Dave Ryder that hired me at W.Y. and Z away from W.S. News that that's quite a story.

[01:50:18.060 --> 01:50:18.840]
W.S. News.

[01:50:19.500 --> 01:50:27.520]
Because I handed my contract at WNWS that if I stayed I forget to the end of the contract I got a twenty twenty five thousand dollar bonus.

[01:50:28.600 --> 01:50:40.300]
And I stayed till the end of the deal and then after I sealed the deal and the meantime I and Z hired me away and they tried to I had to go to court and Cheryl's ex husband the judge Lenny what was his name?

[01:50:41.940 --> 01:50:48.140]
Leonard I can't think of what his name was but anyway we had to have a trial as to whether my non-compete would hold up in court or I could go to work for I and Z.

[01:50:48.320 --> 01:50:49.340]
And of course we won.

[01:50:50.620 --> 01:50:57.500]
Henry Rothblatt sent the one of his flunky attorneys in there to argue my case the judge Lenny or you can't remember his name.

[01:50:57.500 --> 01:50:58.080]
No.

[01:50:58.360 --> 01:51:00.900]
Whatever you drive me to budget has to be Lenny Mark's head.

[01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:01.000]

[01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:01.860]
I can't think of what his name was.

[01:51:01.920 --> 01:51:02.520]
Some Jewish guy.

[01:51:02.580 --> 01:51:03.580]
Well, I know Cheryl was murdered.

[01:51:03.740 --> 01:51:05.300]
You know he was Jewish and he had a lot of money.

[01:51:05.940 --> 01:51:06.840]
That wasn't Ripken.

[01:51:07.440 --> 01:51:08.060]
Leonard Ripken.

[01:51:08.220 --> 01:51:10.120]
And that's about what do you say like that?

[01:51:10.240 --> 01:51:11.060]
Yeah Leonard Ripken.

[01:51:11.300 --> 01:51:12.260]
That's about what he was saying.

[01:51:12.480 --> 01:51:13.280]
That's about what he was saying.

[01:51:13.280 --> 01:51:14.780]
That's about what he was saying.

[01:51:14.780 --> 01:51:15.740]
That was the last name.

[01:51:15.820 --> 01:51:16.680]
All the time we knew her.

[01:51:16.860 --> 01:51:17.080]
That's about the last name.

[01:51:17.080 --> 01:51:20.340]
Before her latest Jewish wealthy thousand and three votes now.

[01:51:20.980 --> 01:51:22.620]
Now you can turn to this baby.

[01:51:23.120 --> 01:51:24.000]
One all over the place.

[01:51:24.300 --> 01:51:25.080]

Thousand and three votes.

[01:51:26.700 --> 01:51:27.960]
I mean, nothing that's a big deal.

[01:51:28.100 --> 01:51:28.540]
It's pretty weak.

[01:51:28.900 --> 01:51:29.480]
As a matter of fact.

[01:51:30.480 --> 01:51:32.120]
And the good part I'm sure.

[01:51:34.680 --> 01:51:36.820]
A hundred and nineteen point six percent.

[01:51:37.680 --> 01:51:38.280]
Hate to pull.

[01:51:38.460 --> 01:51:39.600]
That's not too bad for this crowd.

[01:51:39.700 --> 01:51:41.620]
For this very antsy hostile crowd.

[01:52:09.620 --> 01:52:10.260]
All right.

[01:52:10.560 --> 01:52:11.600]

Mm-hmm like good they they had bread options and I know that doesn't mean a whole lot to you

[01:57:11.860 --> 01:57:14.480]
But you could have like a toasted sourdough

[01:57:15.440 --> 01:57:23.460]
slices two thick slices of toasted sourdough bread instead of the traditional bun for example the bacon was nice and thick and

[01:57:23.460 --> 01:57:24.540]
was good on there

[01:57:25.440 --> 01:57:25.840]

Well, I mean wouldn't you rather put ass on the pole as opposed to back no skin

[01:58:54.100 --> 01:58:59.680]

[01:58:59.680 --> 01:59:00.020]

What a disgusting thought that is for those people

[01:59:42.460 --> 01:59:47.560]
I mean for some people it might be a very erotic thought but for those people it's a grotesque and horrendous thought

[01:59:47.560 --> 01:59:52.300]
I mean like to think that those people are reproducing that's the problem maybe for sterilization. That's what we need

[01:59:53.080 --> 01:59:56.780]
They can do all the hanky spanky. They want. I don't want to deprive anybody of their happiness

[01:59:56.780 --> 02:00:02.940]

[02:00:38.600 --> 02:00:44.740]
The board goes back five six seven oh five sixty you know for a poll that they claim they hated like poison at the beginning of the show

[02:00:44.740 --> 02:00:48.720]
See leave it to me leave it to this old bag to teach them that they liked it

[02:00:48.720 --> 02:00:51.160]

[02:01:06.120 --> 02:01:08.660]
Hello, Mr. Mill yes, sir

[02:01:10.360 --> 02:01:11.980]
Alice who is it?

[02:01:12.940 --> 02:01:14.840]
This is a man

[02:01:16.040 --> 02:01:20.880]
Busy as a three-legged bird dog in a cubby of quail huh

[02:01:22.540 --> 02:01:23.180]
Yeah

[02:01:25.780 --> 02:01:26.420]
and

[02:01:27.940 --> 02:01:30.240]
And oh that was it. Oh, okay

[02:01:30.240 --> 02:01:35.800]
I'm I waited because I was positive there might have had to be more because he saw it so he sounded so authoritative

[02:01:35.800 --> 02:01:40.320]
And so pleased to be on the radio to share his expertise with the audience to share something

[02:01:43.840 --> 02:01:45.260]
WQ I am hello

[02:01:45.260 --> 02:01:50.980]
Yeah, Neil yes, sir. I got a couple for you. Okay, five will get you ten

[02:01:52.600 --> 02:01:58.000]
Not a woodbine it won't five dollars to get you ten said it would buy me. Maybe that's what they meant by that five

[02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:03.980]
I'll get to ten sent and two peas in a pod and two peas or five long time

[02:02:05.420 --> 02:02:07.160]
Okay, yeah, pali

[02:02:07.160 --> 02:02:10.740]
See yeah, he sure tickled a hell out of him. You must have found that further again

[02:02:10.740 --> 02:02:15.240]
First the feather was in his camp and then it must have been that dome got in his place somewhere because he was just tickled

[02:02:15.240 --> 02:02:20.220]
That's what that it was okay. It was you know what not maybe the greatest call in history of the human race

[02:02:23.160 --> 02:02:27.320]
Seriously well when is the last time we didn't anything like this that's had this kind of response

[02:02:27.320 --> 02:02:30.340]
I mean it's probably only 75 million stupid expression

[02:02:30.340 --> 02:02:36.060]
But when's the last time and now are you are we gonna find out where that damn sonic was? I'll I'm sure I'll get the information

[02:02:37.200 --> 02:02:43.860]
Yeah, I'm not the huh, I mean I'm not gonna drive a lot of time right now and go on down to my amitagot find sonic not

[02:02:45.620 --> 02:02:50.600]
But those would see that's another thing like adventure car hop in sagas mass. I told you already warned from our

[02:02:51.200 --> 02:02:53.340]
Arnie woo-woo again and not Arnie Warren

[02:02:53.340 --> 02:02:57.200]
Arnie Ginsburg from W. M. A. X. and Boston he owned that adventure car hop

[02:02:58.760 --> 02:03:03.980]
And that was a great place on the way to rocking him park to lose our money back when I lived in Boston in the early 60s

[02:03:03.980 --> 02:03:07.920]
Always with stuff at adventure car hop and it was those those were great the old car hops

[02:03:09.020 --> 02:03:13.720]
Am I right? Yeah, no, I like the a and w used to go there all the time and

[02:03:13.720 --> 02:03:18.480]
In some of those places the girls would come out on roller skates. That's right. Am I right? Yes

[02:03:19.100 --> 02:03:22.640]
And of course then when they would trip and fall and trade would go flying and all your food on the ground

[02:03:22.640 --> 02:03:24.760]
It wasn't quite so cute when the food would go flying

[02:03:24.760 --> 02:03:28.320]
And some of those heterogies got to look up her dress while she was flopping

[02:03:28.320 --> 02:03:32.340]
That's right, but whatever thought it was somebody else's food. Right. That's right. Oh look at that

[02:03:32.340 --> 02:03:35.480]
She's Sarah over there. She just took a slip and fall and all the food went flying

[02:03:35.480 --> 02:03:39.160]
But look at that, you know back. Yeah, that's what it looks like to me, but never left

[02:03:40.740 --> 02:03:44.280]
So we are really kicking a big family today. We'll find out where that Sonic is in fact

[02:03:44.280 --> 02:03:47.400]
I wouldn't be surprised if George takes the whole family out this weekend of Sonic

[02:03:51.600 --> 02:03:57.280]
Hey, if one was close by you and you know the well I'm gonna find out for you where it is north Miami's not like a million miles from Hollywood

[02:03:57.280 --> 02:04:01.440]
Where you are for Christ's sakes would you? No, no, but still last time I look

[02:04:01.980 --> 02:04:04.760]
Whatever his name is Josh quarters and put no stories up

[02:04:05.480 --> 02:04:09.780]
Where are you Josh? Yeah, so you know that check I was thinking about for Josh

[02:04:09.780 --> 02:04:13.960]
Yeah, occasionally I said I'm gonna listen a good moon wanna you know send away

[02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:17.300]
Nice job, John

[02:04:18.020 --> 02:04:24.580]
People that use snappy openers for their show segments like that one to two-hour

[02:04:24.580 --> 02:04:26.880]
This court finds you give to

[02:04:26.880 --> 02:04:27.680]
I

[02:04:30.240 --> 02:04:31.100]
Burn it

[02:04:31.100 --> 02:04:37.680]
Where is the part and who needed the most I can't believe this I could actually go to jail

[02:04:38.820 --> 02:04:42.240]
Cuz scooter there be as totally toast

[02:04:43.440 --> 02:04:45.280]
Crap not working for you

[02:04:45.280 --> 02:04:49.360]
They said he skills me all the way

[02:04:49.360 --> 02:04:50.680]
He lied and now

[02:04:50.680 --> 02:04:51.300]
He's

[02:04:51.300 --> 02:04:55.800]
And we just need to see him gone

[02:04:59.520 --> 02:05:05.020]
Shoulder saliva just to get us to war the whole story was I can say

[02:05:05.020 --> 02:05:05.980]
Live

[02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:10.260]
Sky high while we're getting poor

[02:05:13.360 --> 02:05:18.520]
Push and chain me must have been high to think we let them

[02:05:20.680 --> 02:05:23.160]
Just need to see them gone

[02:05:24.780 --> 02:05:27.020]
Live behind a bad day

[02:05:27.020 --> 02:05:32.180]
Shooters don't know if the fence is on but they figured it out

[02:05:32.180 --> 02:05:33.780]
It's when you are told

[02:05:33.780 --> 02:05:37.100]
Genie sense of life. They're all going down

[02:05:37.100 --> 02:05:40.080]
Nothing out of that fight you let us

[02:05:40.080 --> 02:05:41.520]
Us a safe clear

[02:05:41.520 --> 02:05:45.660]
I hope they long down to you and changing you a time

[02:05:45.660 --> 02:05:46.960]
It will be yourself

[02:05:52.140 --> 02:05:52.540]
I

[02:05:52.540 --> 02:05:57.560]
Want to one at five sixty W. It's our award winning gigantic one to our let me just take a look and see now

[02:05:57.560 --> 02:06:03.040]
Maybe I'm picking on Josh quarters needlessly, but yeah, well, I think he probably did was he you know

[02:06:03.040 --> 02:06:06.260]
He posted the stories and he forgot to hit the button whatever. No, there's nothing on there

[02:06:07.200 --> 02:06:08.700]
There's nothing on there and

[02:06:09.400 --> 02:06:11.000]
Work work and he be working

[02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:13.120]
You know, I'm saying the met texted

[02:06:13.940 --> 02:06:20.000]
Yeah, send him a text message and say hey you jackass you just blew a nice fat check down the drain because you ain't doing your job

[02:06:20.940 --> 02:06:25.340]
I mean wouldn't it make sense for him to like to double check after we does that just to see if they're on here like oh

[02:06:25.340 --> 02:06:30.820]
Yeah, let's see. There's all the 20 stories in the assembly or sometimes eight or nine or ten or only seven or eight on the weekends

[02:06:30.820 --> 02:06:33.220]
You know because I don't want to overwork his fat ass

[02:06:34.740 --> 02:06:39.260]
But nevertheless we do the best we can house judiciary committee chairman John Connors today

[02:06:39.260 --> 02:06:41.160]
Yes to them. Sorry. Well, whatever

[02:06:41.700 --> 02:06:47.220]
Central editor of the US Attorney General Alberto Vio Fadganzala's demanding answers to allegations that he may have advised the president

[02:06:47.220 --> 02:06:53.100]
To shut down an investigation of the White House's domestic wiretapping surveillance program because of his involvement with the program

[02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:59.880]
It would be an extraordinary abuse of authority if you advise the president on this matter after learning that your own conduct was to be investigated

[02:06:59.880 --> 02:07:00.980]
Connures wrote

[02:07:01.600 --> 02:07:06.800]
Roth story reported earlier yesterday in a statement released by Senator Russ Finegul that expressed some of our concerns about the reports

[02:07:06.800 --> 02:07:13.860]
Concerny the attorney general's possible rule in blocking investigation which he may have been a target. I'll ride put him all in jail

[02:07:13.860 --> 02:07:14.880]
Throw away the key

[02:07:15.440 --> 02:07:21.040]
Connures also issued a statement about ABC News reports of emails linking Carl Rove to the US Attorney firing scandal

[02:07:21.040 --> 02:07:26.980]
These latest reports if through our proof positive that lower level officials in the Justice Department are being hung out to drive

[02:07:26.980 --> 02:07:31.380]
So the statement this goes all the way to the top of the justice department the most senior White House staff

[02:07:32.300 --> 02:07:39.040]
Connures question the truthfulness of testimony given to the West Congress by the Justice Department and but it be pretty good about well there you go now you go John good

[02:07:41.080 --> 02:07:43.780]
Oh, I'm sorry. I should have shredded that I tore it up on the area

[02:07:45.660 --> 02:07:45.980]
560

[02:07:48.300 --> 02:07:54.320]
560 leave a rise did we ever find out where Sonic was yet or what when you're not going there anyway? Oh, Chris found out he looked at one is in Naples

[02:07:55.760 --> 02:07:57.200]
Now that is not true

[02:07:58.620 --> 02:08:03.520]
Really because I'm on their website and I put in for the closest one within 150 miles of Miami

[02:08:03.520 --> 02:08:10.580]
I got an email here the close ones at the hundred Miami one they found one and they also had that other email before from somebody who said

[02:08:10.580 --> 02:08:16.180]
There's a sonic and date county and together Godfather guy. Oh, they must be drinking something because go to the sonic website

[02:08:16.640 --> 02:08:18.340]
closest one is a West Coast

[02:08:19.580 --> 02:08:21.700]
The closest one is on the West Coast

[02:08:22.220 --> 02:08:22.660]
correct

[02:08:23.800 --> 02:08:28.080]
Are you sure well look into the bottom of that before this hour's on I'm gonna tell you right now right

[02:08:28.080 --> 02:08:32.720]
Well, kid the bottom of the sonic dilemma. We'll find out what intersection it's supposed to be at and just

[02:08:35.260 --> 02:08:36.340]
WQ a n hello

[02:08:38.300 --> 02:08:40.840]
Checkers so I don't think there's any sonic's down here

[02:08:41.900 --> 02:08:47.380]
No way no way checkers down here. Yeah, there's chubby chubby checker down there

[02:08:47.380 --> 02:08:51.580]
W checker you got it. Okay, okay, I'm saying how to down delabies at chubby checkers

[02:08:52.260 --> 02:08:58.080]
Well, this is a real dilemma that we got in the middle of now all of a sudden like a one minute one guy saying one thing and then the next

[02:08:58.080 --> 02:09:02.820]
Minute I'm getting a message yet. There is one I found he did a he did a some kind of a search and

[02:09:31.580 --> 02:09:36.320]

I'm here one thing and the next minute I'm here

[02:09:38.920 --> 02:09:42.000]
Another thing and then probably a couple minutes on the channel

[02:09:43.080 --> 02:09:47.840]
So I if everybody in Dave County or even all over South Florida head out for sonic tonight

[02:09:48.440 --> 02:09:53.320]

[02:09:53.960 --> 02:09:56.720]
Don't is WQ a m hello

[02:09:57.240 --> 02:09:58.940]
Hey, Nino. Yes, sir

This man the Valerie plane that's the money. Oh people should be good to the firing squad. Yeah, okay

[02:10:10.500 --> 02:10:14.380]
We know that it's old news WQ a m hello

[02:10:16.100 --> 02:10:22.040]
Neil yes, sir. I can't believe it's been an hour man and nobody's given you the real definition of the GFE yet

[02:10:22.040 --> 02:10:24.440]
It's a code word man. Yeah

[02:10:25.040 --> 02:10:29.020]
It's a code word that means the girl will do a monocle of energy without a condom

[02:10:30.260 --> 02:10:36.640]
They can't well, isn't that nice? Okay. Well, I want we wouldn't have is that on the sheet you had there that gave you all that information

[02:10:37.240 --> 02:10:41.200]
You're right. I never got that far. Thank you Steve. We got it here north Miami 149

[02:10:41.200 --> 02:10:47.240]
75 West Dixie highway what a guy is so now we need an agent to go over there and order up a bacon cheeseburger

[02:10:48.480 --> 02:10:53.860]
North Miami 149 75 West Dixie highway. Well, I think I think we ought to like send him a bill or something

[02:10:54.320 --> 02:10:58.120]
Because you know the power of the show back when we used to have an audience back when people used to

[02:10:58.120 --> 02:11:03.240]
It's right listen to me so I remember those days wasn't that long ago, man till Joe Bell came to town

[02:11:03.240 --> 02:11:05.380]
Well, there's that Peggy Eddenfield again with no teeth

[02:11:06.640 --> 02:11:12.200]
The child of the child lived in the same mobile home park as the suspect. Oh mobile home park see trailer trash

[02:11:12.200 --> 02:11:17.060]
See what I'm saying. I don't want to knock everybody lose in a trailer park, but Josh says the story's been up there

[02:11:18.480 --> 02:11:19.740]
What city was that also

[02:11:21.500 --> 02:11:26.420]
What what are you talking about 149 75 West Dixie highway? That's North Miami, okay

[02:11:27.120 --> 02:11:32.460]
What are you questioning now? I got that information from my main man on there my number one correspond to the universe and the

[02:11:32.460 --> 02:11:34.800]
Teleando you're questioning how big your pardon

[02:11:35.800 --> 02:11:37.780]
No, he's not an evil illegal alien

[02:11:37.780 --> 02:11:43.080]
Oh, you never know what am I looking for? Oh, I'm looking for the stories are not there

[02:11:43.080 --> 02:11:46.600]
Well, if they are then he must have posted them with yesterday's or something like that

[02:11:46.600 --> 02:11:49.900]
See the stories may be there, but the stats are just not sure what I'm up on today

[02:11:49.900 --> 02:11:55.000]
I don't know and you know what I'm sorry that I even mentioned sorry Josh and you're still like it no check

[02:11:58.660 --> 02:12:04.780]
Well, what did he say what what what I'm curious? He said he'll go check and then he came back and here he is now and he says I checked in the

[02:12:04.780 --> 02:12:05.240]
Rept there

[02:12:05.980 --> 02:12:09.300]
Yeah, but what about on the stats thing it shows no stories it shows no stats

[02:12:10.760 --> 02:12:12.160]
He said I'm on his

[02:12:13.440 --> 02:12:20.060]
I beg your pardon. He said it does on his it shows stats on your page for today. Yes from March 16

[02:12:21.180 --> 02:12:24.520]
2007 this doesn't show any story read by anybody doesn't even show any

[02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:30.060]
Get out of here. I saw a gaslight man. You got to be kidding me boring movie

[02:12:30.820 --> 02:12:34.320]
It was great. Yeah, there's no sonic on that address either

[02:12:36.840 --> 02:12:38.020]
Well, what does that mean?

[02:12:39.340 --> 02:12:41.260]
Oh, this is turning into a

[02:12:41.260 --> 02:12:43.820]
Mess what how do you know there's no sonic on that address?

[02:12:44.700 --> 02:12:47.860]
If you put a sonic driving dot com

[02:12:47.860 --> 02:12:54.980]
Yeah, have a store locator button you put any address or even just like a town and how many miles away from that address and it tells you

[02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:56.140]
Where the closest ones are?

[02:12:58.020 --> 02:13:01.940]
Maybe maybe it's subsonic maybe a super sonic

[02:13:03.280 --> 02:13:07.440]
It'll be a shame if people started wasting their time going there and like you've come to find out it wasn't there

[02:13:07.440 --> 02:13:11.580]
Maybe it's a decoy, you know, that's right. Somebody's waiting there to make it something else there

[02:13:11.580 --> 02:13:14.260]
Maybe there's one of those hot to go is left over from the Pepsi people

[02:13:15.080 --> 02:13:20.700]
Wasn't it Pepsi was a coke I think was Pepsi, wouldn't I don't recall they started the hot to go because they were pissed off because the other

[02:13:20.700 --> 02:13:27.320]
Chains were only doing Coca-Cola coke instead of Pepsi and so is as their way of rebuilding we're gonna show you guys a thing or two

[02:13:27.320 --> 02:13:29.560]
We're gonna put all you fast food guys out of our business

[02:13:29.560 --> 02:13:36.360]
So they open up those hot to go they weren't so hot and they did go they were guys and go away Pepsi has lots of businesses like Taco Bell and KFC

[02:13:36.360 --> 02:13:38.600]
For example, Miguel said he's gonna go check for us

[02:13:39.320 --> 02:13:41.620]
Check for you what it's gonna go drive over to the address

[02:13:42.860 --> 02:13:45.940]
He's gonna drive over to that address to see if the sonic is really there

[02:13:45.940 --> 02:13:50.560]
Well, that would be quite a shame. It's got nothing better to do their damn few stations in America that would do that for you

[02:13:50.700 --> 02:13:55.500]
Where they have the promotions guy go and drive over to see if they're really a such a place

[02:13:56.680 --> 02:13:58.680]
And we're big time here, huh?

[02:13:59.100 --> 02:14:03.040]
We're big time we can maybe that was out there information that my buddy found on the internet's there

[02:14:03.040 --> 02:14:04.940]
That could be it. I mean just because it's on the internet

[02:14:04.940 --> 02:14:09.420]
It might have been there 75 years ago. It might have been there when George Washington was a baby for all we know

[02:14:11.100 --> 02:14:14.780]
But will Miguel's gonna go right over there and check that to me sounds like that

[02:14:16.100 --> 02:14:20.580]
Not far from where the well-known since the up to three a few blocks because I used to live there and

[02:14:20.700 --> 02:14:27.160]
Twin Lakes Racking Club. Mm-hmm. I'm 441 and 100 and I want to say 51 right by their year Golden Glades Interchange

[02:14:27.160 --> 02:14:30.440]
Back when there were like 10 or 20 white people lived in that neighborhood and part of town

[02:14:30.440 --> 02:14:32.520]
I mean, I'm just I'm just saying it like it is, you know

[02:14:33.060 --> 02:14:38.580]
Not to the same thing wrong with that but that part of town is kind of changing demographics in the intervening years

[02:14:38.580 --> 02:14:42.420]
Eric says yes, the stories were posted with the wrong date for some reason. Yeah

[02:14:42.420 --> 02:14:46.880]
You won't see the stats until tomorrow. Oh, I don't really care what the stats are all that much

[02:14:46.880 --> 02:14:52.080]
Is just that if I don't see anything on there to me I start getting panicking like that you know me

[02:14:53.260 --> 02:14:56.140]
Yeah, just like that because I think oh error. What's his name?

[02:14:56.420 --> 02:15:00.560]
Justin put them up there at all so they are on there somewhere just look around you'll find some crap

[02:15:00.560 --> 02:15:05.080]
Just like the sonic thing if it's not right where we told you was just keep looking around you'll find one so

[02:15:05.080 --> 02:15:08.960]
I guess what what we found something you found someone

[02:15:09.880 --> 02:15:11.200]
Their website you have to like

[02:15:11.620 --> 02:15:13.860]
Check different things and if you check everything to the club

[02:15:13.860 --> 02:15:20.680]
There's one on 1520 North Miami North. Wait a minute. So there's a bunch of Sonic's around and we'll count more down in the day counting

[02:15:20.680 --> 02:15:23.720]
For it. We have one. I'm sorry. These are three are Kansas

[02:15:24.980 --> 02:15:28.780]
So we have 1520 North Maine Miami North what?

[02:15:29.460 --> 02:15:31.540]
Never mind the sites all messed up

[02:15:31.540 --> 02:15:34.940]
North America yeah, I'm such before they're giving us a whole local home and also

[02:15:37.080 --> 02:15:39.860]
You know this is turned into a real

[02:15:41.500 --> 02:15:46.360]
Picking a poke to go back to the original topic today. You're poking a pig. Yeah, poking it

[02:15:46.360 --> 02:15:49.280]
I mean, what are you talking about

[02:15:50.740 --> 02:15:55.100]
Hey, I'm just looking at this. I thought you just said you found one. Okay, and where does it say Miami?

[02:15:55.460 --> 02:16:00.320]
It says like I clicked on it Miami Ohio. Yeah, it's like Miami Ohio Miami Kansas everything else

[02:16:00.320 --> 02:16:03.500]
We're not getting a something for Florida right now, so what we'll keep checking

[02:16:06.800 --> 02:16:09.980]
This has become a little I don't think I can emotionally deal with this

[02:16:11.920 --> 02:16:17.960]
I mean ask me if I care do I really care? No, it'll be nice nice for the audience to find out nice for everybody to find out

[02:16:18.580 --> 02:16:22.840]
I mean don't be so Miguel is really on his way over there to that location see if they're really is a Sonic

[02:16:23.460 --> 02:16:27.420]
Apparently, it's what he said that now that is special. Thanks Miguel. You're the best man

[02:16:28.920 --> 02:16:32.180]
That is really I guarantee you the guys across the street aren't gonna be doing that

[02:16:32.180 --> 02:16:35.660]
You can be damn sure that Sid Rosenstein grants burger shorts. He ain't doing that

[02:16:36.340 --> 02:16:39.920]
They're sitting around fat and sassy now. We're gonna have big trend. We had it

[02:16:39.920 --> 02:16:42.480]
It wasn't something first of all and believe me and ain't gonna happen again

[02:16:42.480 --> 02:16:43.240]
Hi there you

[02:16:43.240 --> 02:16:43.800]
bruh

[02:16:43.800 --> 02:16:44.260]
still

[02:16:45.200 --> 02:16:48.700]
Hi there bothered by those pesky religious fanatics

[02:16:49.160 --> 02:16:51.460]
Excuse me have you made peace with the ultimate supreme being?

[02:16:51.540 --> 02:16:52.040]
Leave me on!

[02:16:52.820 --> 02:16:54.980]
Yes, you could try blowing them up

[02:16:56.020 --> 02:16:58.620]
Pardon me sir, but did you know that your moral soul is in danger?

[02:17:00.120 --> 02:17:06.560]
But think of the mess not to mention those legal fees. That's why we at Lingham Labs have developed Jehovah Way

[02:17:06.560 --> 02:17:09.620]
The clean simple way to rid yourself of those annoying acolytes

[02:17:11.940 --> 02:17:12.420]
Jesus

[02:17:14.140 --> 02:17:15.620]
Knock it off!

[02:17:17.140 --> 02:17:18.260]
Where are we?

[02:17:18.480 --> 02:17:19.240]
What are we doing here?

[02:17:19.440 --> 02:17:20.980]
Man, I gotta get a life too!

[02:17:21.500 --> 02:17:26.000]
Yes, Jehovah Way proven safe and effective and for those annoying encounters at the airport

[02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:28.000]
It's new travel-sized Jehovah Way

[02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:29.840]
Hi, they're Christmas! Christmas Christmas!

[02:17:30.700 --> 02:17:36.560]
Hey, where do I get the stupid clothes and what's my hair? My hair!

[02:17:36.560 --> 02:17:40.060]
Yes, Jehovah Way, little spray that keeps fanatics away

[02:17:40.060 --> 02:17:43.180]
Look for it in the pest control section of your local hardware store

[02:17:43.180 --> 02:17:46.540]
Okay, 118 at 560 WQ I am the mystery continues

[02:17:46.540 --> 02:17:50.400]
I went on the sonic thing myself just out of curiosity and I typed in Miami, Florida

[02:17:50.400 --> 02:17:53.320]
And anywhere there's nowhere within 10 miles according to that

[02:17:53.320 --> 02:17:57.220]
Then we get this back from Tracy and the king of one of our regular friends who says

[02:17:57.720 --> 02:18:01.420]
I don't know the exact address but there's a sonic burger on Biscayne just north of downtown

[02:18:01.420 --> 02:18:04.320]
Just out of the new times building, have a great day, you two Tracy

[02:18:04.840 --> 02:18:09.400]
So there's two sonic stuff we got here and we get better check it out

[02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:12.840]
The one in North Miami at 149.75 Dixie Highway

[02:18:12.840 --> 02:18:18.060]
I mean it's entirely possible that maybe they disappeared and maybe these are new locations again

[02:18:18.060 --> 02:18:21.720]
Possible or not as the case may be but I will say this

[02:18:21.720 --> 02:18:27.660]
At least got us off those stupid cliches and expressions that we're getting 80 million phone calls about

[02:18:28.420 --> 02:18:29.760]
What was it on Biscayne?

[02:18:30.400 --> 02:18:38.580]
It doesn't have an address, she says there's a son for you are really something because there's a checkers on 1650 Biscayne Boulevard

[02:18:39.820 --> 02:18:40.340]
Yeah

[02:18:41.080 --> 02:18:45.960]
Maybe they're seeing checkers and thinking it's sonic because you know as we all know Tracy's not all there

[02:18:45.960 --> 02:18:53.300]
Well, what does that mean? I think he's confusing Tracy with Tammy. Oh, I apologize and I apologize Tracy's a sweetheart for you

[02:18:53.300 --> 02:18:54.600]
It's been nice knowing you man

[02:18:55.260 --> 02:19:00.520]
But you got 10 female listeners and friends about eight of them they got you know an IQ larger than their thumbnail

[02:19:00.520 --> 02:19:04.880]
And he's ripping Tracy. I think they're both going to come over and kill him cool good

[02:19:04.880 --> 02:19:11.020]
She said is a sonic burger on Biscayne just north of downtown just out of the new times building we'll find out from this crowd WQA and hello

[02:19:11.760 --> 02:19:13.480]
Yeah, speak to me speaking

How about you can't make a

[02:19:18.160 --> 02:19:20.360]
We're done with that crap. Okay WQA and hello

[02:19:21.100 --> 02:19:26.860]

[02:19:33.920 --> 02:19:35.160]

Lay this just to be the rough. Okay. Thanks pal. You got it. Okay. There you go call up

[02:19:52.780 --> 02:19:54.400]
411 if you can handle that

Take your finger off the food they call it finger food. He's fingering it

[02:19:58.860 --> 02:20:04.040]
Take the finger off the food log it up to a stick it in the phone. They're called 411 ask for sonic. Where did he say?

[02:20:05.860 --> 02:20:07.280]
104th wherever where he said

[02:20:09.200 --> 02:20:12.480]
Maybe you're something maybe there's a bunch of them and they just aren't on their website yet

[02:20:12.480 --> 02:20:19.280]
Maybe they just from open maybe they replace some of the old checkers with some right I mean this guy sounded lucky and IQ

[02:20:19.280 --> 02:20:24.340]
Larger than this thumbnail. He sounded legit sounds legit to me sounds like a human being right WQA and hello

[02:20:24.880 --> 02:20:26.260]
Is it Neil? It is

[02:20:27.200 --> 02:20:32.900]
Neil how you doing? I've been listening to you guys for 20 years. Love to show excellent. Good taste

[02:20:33.520 --> 02:20:40.940]
Hey, the closest sonic I know of is in Arcadia. Extern year in Arcadia. There's a good one there. That's where the nut houses too

[02:20:42.880 --> 02:20:44.700]
Hey, yeah one more thing. Yep

[02:20:46.120 --> 02:20:48.400]
Cali shake my humming. I fuck

[02:20:50.300 --> 02:20:53.560]
Yeah, right. Good bleep there too by the way not

[02:20:56.060 --> 02:20:59.500]
I even hit it again. This is me on the safe side. We all did. Oh, yeah

[02:20:59.980 --> 02:21:05.040]
Anyway, so we got Tracy with the one and then Steve said is one of North Miami and this other guy said there's one in Kendall

[02:21:05.040 --> 02:21:08.260]
I think there's a sonic at every street corral. Oh, if you ask me

[02:21:09.640 --> 02:21:10.160]
I

[02:21:10.160 --> 02:21:14.860]
Sure hope at least it's like CS one of those things. You know like your hope. It's lucky used to be you know

[02:21:15.440 --> 02:21:19.920]
Yeah, it's really good if people are all the effort to find it WQA and hello

[02:21:20.780 --> 02:21:23.760]
Neil yes, sir the one that's on dick the highway

[02:21:24.420 --> 02:21:27.300]
140 something or another long gone gone about

[02:21:27.940 --> 02:21:31.480]
Eight ten years now really yeah, it became a

[02:21:32.100 --> 02:21:38.240]
Jamaican place, you know how the neighborhood is. Oh, no. Oh, yeah, but you should know anything that's

[02:21:38.260 --> 02:21:43.100]
good in South Florida as a blast that is that is correct look at flood rockers look at

[02:21:43.760 --> 02:21:49.440]
Some of the other chain. Oh, are be um hardy, you know, right on uh-huh, you know

[02:21:49.440 --> 02:21:53.600]
So yeah, I kiss that one goodbye. I know there's one of four peers. There's one in Naples

[02:21:53.600 --> 02:21:58.900]
See in South Florida, they can only have things that you can you can gum you can't you have to don't need to have teeth to eat them

[02:21:59.660 --> 02:22:05.140]
Well, let's just go and get the next blender that's on sale at RJ. Okay. Take care

[02:22:06.700 --> 02:22:10.920]
Yeah, Apple sauce doing how about a take out apple sauce to be good. Oh, oh all much

[02:22:10.920 --> 02:22:14.680]
Yeah, I mean you don't have to build a drive for these the senior citizens will build one for you

[02:22:14.680 --> 02:22:17.560]
Everything that you can gum over there you could have apple sauce

[02:22:17.560 --> 02:22:18.960]
So what I'm most sexy highway

[02:22:18.960 --> 02:22:24.520]
I wouldn't be wasting my time going over there because this guy said it's long gone like like somebody that

[02:22:24.520 --> 02:22:29.380]
The good things in South Florida used to be what video they probably bailed out just like I did

[02:22:30.160 --> 02:22:34.200]
So that one's gone, but then we got the one in Kendall there, you know, and now did you call up?

[02:22:34.580 --> 02:22:40.240]
He's on the phone now he's on the phone right now getting the address and finding out the exact location if there really is a sonic burger

[02:22:40.240 --> 02:22:42.000]
You'll hear it first right here, man

[02:22:43.560 --> 02:22:44.400]
Are you sure

[02:22:47.040 --> 02:22:53.080]
Well, one exciting week. I was started Monday with a 1500 and some odd votes and just about shattered the I mean shattered the world record

[02:22:54.060 --> 02:22:56.480]
And out of the day we got this sonic business. Okay, which

[02:22:56.940 --> 02:23:00.740]
Quite frankly didn't everybody think that they were long gone now. What's the story Chris? You like yeah

[02:23:00.740 --> 02:23:05.080]
411 has no sonics listed at all in date or Broward County

[02:23:08.760 --> 02:23:10.160]
Well that's that

[02:23:14.200 --> 02:23:21.220]
Well, that's the guy talking about Tracy's got this one here. Maybe people are remembering sonics that were there

[02:23:21.220 --> 02:23:22.620]
You know yesterday

[02:23:22.620 --> 02:23:26.820]
But these are people who live there see

[02:23:27.380 --> 02:23:29.580]
Like Tracy actually lives in this guy to call the

[02:23:30.960 --> 02:23:36.340]
Yeah, so Kendall 104th I drive Kendall a lot. I don't remember seeing a sonic at all

[02:23:37.520 --> 02:23:40.220]
And you know this man would remember a sonic if he saw oh

[02:23:40.220 --> 02:23:45.240]
Oh, I'm gonna pop it. We got to go to the canes after this. I'll check 104th in Kendall

[02:23:46.960 --> 02:23:49.220]
Well, but we're jealous. Oh, well, hey McGell you better

[02:23:49.220 --> 02:23:52.960]
Tell him to forget about it, but bring me back a bacon cheeseburger anyway

[02:23:52.960 --> 02:23:57.600]
Oh, man

[02:23:57.600 --> 02:24:03.160]
Bring one back from the AW you know here. We got everybody all whipped up and we thought we really had our

[02:24:03.160 --> 02:24:08.880]
Our finger on it so to speak focus says they have them in Orlando. Well, let's go to Orlando. I'm on my way now Q a.m

[02:24:08.880 --> 02:24:15.340]
Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. What about the big one that got away. Yeah, okay. W Q a.m. Hello

[02:24:15.840 --> 02:24:16.660]
A meal

[02:24:17.120 --> 02:24:18.720]
Yes, there is no

[02:24:19.160 --> 02:24:21.400]
Sonics and day County this like you've been said, bro

[02:24:21.400 --> 02:24:26.720]
I drive all over day county every single day. There's no sonic that was there on way 60 highway

[02:24:26.720 --> 02:24:28.340]
It's left in 1997

[02:24:31.420 --> 02:24:33.320]
1997 brother. Sorry, man. Love you, Neil

[02:24:33.320 --> 02:24:35.180]
Thanks for the bad news palies. Thanks

[02:24:35.520 --> 02:24:37.920]
So there you go. We're doing a little investigation. It's where I work on here

[02:24:37.920 --> 02:24:41.860]
We're saving some people a lot of drive around when it be something to make your plans to like go ahead dinner

[02:24:41.860 --> 02:24:44.780]
There's something tonight and then you drive over there and there's like a big empty lot

[02:24:46.520 --> 02:24:48.600]
I'll tell you what else I wonder if it's still there

[02:24:48.600 --> 02:24:52.340]
You know what that was that diner. There was the first McDonald's in Florida

[02:24:53.640 --> 02:24:57.080]
Right on a biscane boulevard. I know that when you're talking about with the

[02:24:57.080 --> 02:25:03.220]
The very famous diner that was been there for a zine years and they're both gone right the brown derby

[02:25:05.500 --> 02:25:09.320]
What are you talking about making a joke? No, you know the diner I'm talking about yes

[02:25:09.320 --> 02:25:13.000]
Very famous place and and the McDonald's there was the first one in the state

[02:25:13.400 --> 02:25:17.300]
And I had actually gone through there you know, gone through the drive through there a few times 100 years ago

[02:25:17.300 --> 02:25:18.220]
That's long gone

[02:25:19.260 --> 02:25:25.400]
And and you're telling me that it's not interesting reminiscing about the places that are gone at least we at least we do a pubic service until the audience

[02:25:25.400 --> 02:25:28.060]
Don't go there. It's not there. No, no, don't go there man

[02:25:28.480 --> 02:25:33.460]
You're wasting your time and you're very expensive gasoline and thank you mr. President for that very inexpensive

[02:25:34.120 --> 02:25:35.380]
Vaseline so we misunderstood

[02:25:36.600 --> 02:25:41.580]
We thought that a guy was saying thank you for the low prices on gasoline and it's Vaseline

[02:25:41.580 --> 02:25:47.380]
Because that's what this is about synopsis are doing to us all don't send five pages of sonic maps from university dodgy

[02:25:47.380 --> 02:25:48.260]
maniacs

[02:25:48.820 --> 02:25:50.700]
What what does that mean why are they doing that?

[02:25:51.160 --> 02:25:52.240]
What do you mean why?

[02:25:52.760 --> 02:25:57.000]
Because they can no more so what are the maps to tell you not here

[02:25:57.840 --> 02:26:01.280]
They don't exist the closest one is like in the Orlando Melbourne

[02:26:02.100 --> 02:26:02.580]
Oh

[02:26:04.740 --> 02:26:10.760]
How to stress again depressing everybody was all whipped up into a frenzy about this it was like all good times

[02:26:10.760 --> 02:26:13.420]
Maybe good times. I'm gonna play that theme just to piss you off

[02:26:14.920 --> 02:26:17.080]
And there ain't no sonic no mo well

[02:26:17.720 --> 02:26:22.460]
Just like that song by bill withers ain't no sunshine anymore. Remember that depressing to go withers

[02:26:22.460 --> 02:26:25.660]
He did lean on me. Yeah, he was depressing like Bobby Goldsboro

[02:26:26.840 --> 02:26:31.860]
All those suicide records, you know, and if you and if they weren't about suicide when they listen to me wanted to commit suicide

[02:26:32.940 --> 02:26:35.540]
Mm-hmm 26 pants one so there's no signing in

[02:26:36.740 --> 02:26:37.540]
Any mo

[02:26:38.040 --> 02:26:41.900]
I'm a girl says he's turning around. Yeah turn around Miguel. Sorry. Thank you anyway pal. Thank you

[02:26:43.500 --> 02:26:47.320]
Well, say the gas the gas Boston Armand Lake a guy like Miguel. I mean, you know, he's a good guy

[02:26:47.320 --> 02:26:51.940]
But he can't afford to be wasted in half a decade gas just to drive down there in the sea. Oh, that used to be here like

[02:26:51.940 --> 02:26:55.180]
What do you guys say 10 years ago? He's probably in the QA with Van anyways

[02:26:55.840 --> 02:26:57.260]
He's probably sitting in the parking lot

[02:26:57.960 --> 02:27:01.860]
With somehow chick who's not his wife. Oh, I'm sorry. That's I that was a bad idea

[02:27:03.520 --> 02:27:03.840]
27

[02:27:07.700 --> 02:27:10.160]
27 past one at five sixty WQA

[02:27:10.880 --> 02:27:13.620]
Good what was it you heard me

[02:27:15.660 --> 02:27:18.560]
I was visiting for some excuse me sorry

[02:27:24.640 --> 02:27:25.840]
Old days

[02:27:25.840 --> 02:27:29.040]
This town was once alive

[02:27:30.980 --> 02:27:32.980]
They even had to regret

[02:27:35.140 --> 02:27:37.520]
There were things to do all night

[02:27:37.520 --> 02:27:37.520]

[02:27:39.840 --> 02:27:45.480]
Broward and in day but the old fart walking dead and the power to let

[02:27:46.080 --> 02:27:51.400]
The crooked wheels who just got off the boat I heard he'll ride your

[02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:56.960]
This is the day that Miami died

[02:27:58.100 --> 02:28:02.960]
The best for the one who brought us home

[02:28:03.760 --> 02:28:04.860]
Through Miami

[02:28:06.560 --> 02:28:08.560]
Then you believe there was a time

[02:28:10.720 --> 02:28:12.720]
They had casinos and hallendale

[02:28:13.920 --> 02:28:17.580]
Oh my god try to organize the crime

[02:28:19.120 --> 02:28:25.760]
But the experiment had failed when the brain did gave you down and door the false of sound

[02:28:25.760 --> 02:28:27.700]
They pissed along the plate

[02:28:27.700 --> 02:28:29.640]
It's a big cut in the screen

[02:28:29.640 --> 02:28:31.280]
I heard the old Rogers

[02:28:32.520 --> 02:28:33.440]
Oh well

[02:28:37.800 --> 02:28:39.140]
I'm touching it baby

[02:28:47.180 --> 02:28:48.880]
Well, punch it again

[02:28:48.880 --> 02:28:52.360]
Yeah, the day radio died how about a sequel to that brother

[02:28:53.020 --> 02:28:56.400]
And here I thought there was no chance to be anything in that oh yeah

[02:28:56.400 --> 02:28:58.280]
I don't know what oh yeah what

[02:28:58.280 --> 02:29:01.340]
Burn me once I found out that there are those things usually come in

[02:29:01.340 --> 02:29:03.240]
When you least expect that

[02:29:03.240 --> 02:29:04.740]
I see

[02:29:05.380 --> 02:29:08.720]
Well anyway I hit the thing 400 times if that's enough too bad

[02:29:09.580 --> 02:29:13.720]
Here's the fact that says these guys these jokers are mistaking checkers for sonics

[02:29:13.720 --> 02:29:16.520]
That's a checkers on 104th in Pinecrest

[02:29:17.120 --> 02:29:18.460]
Not a sonic okay

[02:29:18.460 --> 02:29:22.560]
I have no idea what the one that um oh and Chuck wants Tracy's picture on the website

[02:29:22.560 --> 02:29:27.080]
No way Chuck just leave our listeners alone okay quick look into molest all of our listeners

[02:29:28.060 --> 02:29:32.020]
Chuck says this is a great fact over him Chuck. He says this is really special

[02:29:32.480 --> 02:29:35.720]
Last time I ate at sonic in Tampa. I had a double burger within

[02:29:36.820 --> 02:29:41.060]
This is great with the minutes. I had violent diarrhea and I had to go to the bathroom

[02:29:41.060 --> 02:29:47.360]
The sonic only was a drive-through we needless to say I went in my pants. Thank God they gave me a handful of paper napkins

[02:29:47.920 --> 02:29:48.680]
I drove back the

[02:29:48.680 --> 02:29:53.040]
And I drove back the next day to ask for my money back and they were closed

[02:29:53.040 --> 02:29:56.280]
Said Chuck what a story how's it up to make you up Chuck

[02:29:59.260 --> 02:30:03.000]
Oh, well maybe there's maybe there's a blessing in the skies there you see right

[02:30:03.680 --> 02:30:05.920]
Speaking of stupid cliches. It's a blessing in the skies

[02:30:05.920 --> 02:30:09.560]
There is no more sonic because it'll just go right through you like an h-bomb

[02:30:10.820 --> 02:30:14.260]
Like a nuclear weapon in your kishkis. Well, so there you go wait we tried

[02:30:14.260 --> 02:30:20.680]
And for just a couple of times there for a couple of moments see that anything really good like that in the food in the area food man

[02:30:20.680 --> 02:30:25.940]
A lot of good stuff that's come to town though, especially fast food things chains like that

[02:30:26.580 --> 02:30:31.460]
Mm-hmm, and they they just you know if it's at least it all solid like if there's any real meat in it

[02:30:31.460 --> 02:30:35.880]
You know then you require actual teeth to chew it. It probably can be around too long

[02:30:36.860 --> 02:30:38.060]
Which is kind of sad

[02:30:40.280 --> 02:30:41.680]
WQIM sonic line hello

[02:30:44.900 --> 02:30:45.460]
Hey

[02:30:45.460 --> 02:30:47.180]
Yeah, yeah, you don't listen

[02:30:47.180 --> 02:30:51.380]
I know that I'm anti-plotive said that impeachment was off the table

[02:30:51.380 --> 02:30:54.680]
But just hearing the start of Mrs. Plains the testimony

[02:30:54.680 --> 02:30:57.160]
You know, I want to know what's going through this woman's mind

[02:30:57.160 --> 02:31:02.820]
The only thing that she sure said was she has no idea how many of her contacts were killed worldwide

[02:31:03.360 --> 02:31:08.620]
And the extent of a damage that Carl Robin arrested a bushman to dip towards this country

[02:31:08.620 --> 02:31:11.620]
That's her major thing was a weapon to match the stuff

[02:31:12.080 --> 02:31:16.080]
No, okay pal. I'll call Nancy right now until I pass it along you if there it

[02:31:17.400 --> 02:31:19.200]
I mean, what what do you want me to do about it?

[02:31:19.200 --> 02:31:22.960]
So I mean everyone like fix it. Oh, I'm gonna okay. I'll fix it on Monday

[02:31:23.680 --> 02:31:26.380]
Let's rest up over the weekend. Let's drive around looking for sonic burgers

[02:31:26.380 --> 02:31:32.860]
And then once we get a good rest and a good meal on our perfect then then we can roll in like Ross furrows is roll up your streams and do new do

[02:31:32.860 --> 02:31:35.900]
Lift up the hook that engine and get out the old studies and do do do

[02:31:37.340 --> 02:31:39.420]
I think I sonic man. He did did did

[02:31:40.040 --> 02:31:44.780]
He do did it Q.A.M. Hello. Yeah, listen tell me all that the closest

[02:31:45.480 --> 02:31:49.560]
Uh, Sonic is in Melbourne. Okay. I looked it up on my GPS

[02:31:50.640 --> 02:31:56.400]
You're positive now. Yes, sir. I am okay. Thank you. What you want the address? I give it to you now

[02:31:56.400 --> 02:31:58.360]
Well, no we're not going to Melbourne. I'll go into that

[02:31:59.800 --> 02:32:04.920]
Okay, thank you closest Sonic is in Melbourne. So I get my car right now. It's 130 in the afternoon

[02:32:04.920 --> 02:32:07.260]
You can be up there by a rush hour time

[02:32:08.500 --> 02:32:13.340]
You fill it up and then the way like I said bring up some depends like the astronaut like the lady astronaut

[02:32:13.340 --> 02:32:18.600]
I bring a whole bunch of depends because from what Chuck said it might might be kind of interesting drive home, you know

[02:32:20.340 --> 02:32:25.540]
So I'm gonna Q.A.M. Hello. Hey, what's up, Neil? I'm the topic of a restaurant attrition in South Florida

[02:32:25.540 --> 02:32:29.260]
Yes, there was a place called cheeseburger and paradise that opened up in the fashion mall

[02:32:29.260 --> 02:32:32.600]
It was right next to bone fish grill, which I really don't care much for

[02:32:33.040 --> 02:32:36.440]
It had great burgers. It was real cheap. I'm using nice atmosphere

[02:32:36.440 --> 02:32:40.860]
He listed after about eight months the places shut down because they shut down the whole fashion mall

[02:32:40.860 --> 02:32:43.320]
And I've not heard any plans of the place reopening. So

[02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:47.140]
It's another one of the great restaurants that just disappears in his car for the course man

[02:32:47.140 --> 02:32:50.040]
Typically, I never go on pally thanks for the bad news man

[02:32:50.040 --> 02:32:53.800]
Well, let's South Florida for you can't complain about the taste in tongue as there isn't any, you know

[02:32:54.420 --> 02:32:58.000]
Not saying there aren't any good restaurants left because that would be really a stupid and bad thing to say

[02:32:58.000 --> 02:33:01.520]
There are some but a lot of the places that we used to love man long gone

[02:33:02.020 --> 02:33:05.220]
Long gone including sonic evidently all gone

[02:33:07.640 --> 02:33:09.360]
And let me ask you this

[02:33:10.260 --> 02:33:13.940]
Since it's the same ownership. Why is it that people are getting checkers confused?

[02:33:14.480 --> 02:33:16.380]
Oh with sonic like Tracy am I

[02:33:16.380 --> 02:33:19.600]
I'm gonna lay out same kind of sign? I don't know

[02:33:19.600 --> 02:33:25.000]
Same kind of sign that says what this is sonic and over on the kidding. It's really checkers like that

[02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:30.080]
There's no it is. They're spelling it wrong. Oh, so KERS right sokers

[02:33:31.520 --> 02:33:32.960]
I wonder how Bob Soaker is doing

[02:33:34.400 --> 02:33:39.580]
Remember our good old weatherman Bob Soaker are ready from channel seven wonder how is he doing still fat probably

[02:33:40.380 --> 02:33:45.800]
W.A.M. Hello. Hey Neil. Yes, sir. Yes, I'm a son of a there's a

[02:33:45.800 --> 02:33:52.880]
There's a place on Griffin Road. It's where he has to yilvin Boulevard. It's called. Oh, yeah, uh, W.A.M. Hello

[02:33:55.780 --> 02:33:59.680]
Neil. I'm yes, Neil. I've never heard so much misinformation in my life

[02:34:00.140 --> 02:34:06.900]
Checkers and and sonic are not the same company. It was checkers and rallies. Oh rallies. Oh rallies

[02:34:07.440 --> 02:34:09.140]
Those were the and checkers is garbage

[02:34:09.140 --> 02:34:14.460]
Sonic used to be down there used to be a location where you said on North Miami Beach or on

[02:34:14.460 --> 02:34:17.580]
Dixie highway. They used to be one in Davie

[02:34:17.580 --> 02:34:22.980]
Um on Nova Drive. There used to be one in Kendall and I think there was one in homestead

[02:34:22.980 --> 02:34:26.240]
Neil used to weigh 360 pounds believe me. I know my junk food

[02:34:26.920 --> 02:34:33.400]
Here is that this is a guy we can trust. They are long gone since about the mid 90s mid to late 90s

[02:34:33.400 --> 02:34:34.180]
They're all gone

[02:34:34.720 --> 02:34:38.760]
They're in other parts of Florida just like hardies is long gone and there are other parts of Florida

[02:34:39.420 --> 02:34:46.380]
Hardies and water burger which is also another good chain. They have in Tampa area Orlando and the pan handle not down here

[02:34:47.240 --> 02:34:51.980]
Um, but sonic is long gone from here whether the lever tried to come back. I don't know

[02:34:51.980 --> 02:34:55.880]
But this is an area that you know, I don't have to tell you you're long gone too

[02:34:56.240 --> 02:35:01.560]
No, but there's been a lot of misinformation. There used to be sonic's here. They are gone

[02:35:02.360 --> 02:35:07.960]
Thanks pal. This is the voice and the body of experience. Well, I'm no longer that quite that body only 260 now

[02:35:07.960 --> 02:35:10.960]
I'm not congratulating. All right. Thank you. Yeah. Okay

[02:35:11.440 --> 02:35:15.440]
Well, he's probably glad because it sounded me like he liked sonic and he's glad they're gone because he would know

[02:35:15.440 --> 02:35:19.740]
Like with Chris it's good thing that it's not there because Chris would be if that one in Kendall was

[02:35:19.740 --> 02:35:24.040]
Still open down here. You'd be stopping there tonight two three four times. Oh, yeah, sure

[02:35:24.040 --> 02:35:29.680]
Guarante you wouldn't be going there. I mean, I went there a couple times. It wasn't like a push. I went out of my way to go to

[02:35:30.880 --> 02:35:36.960]
Oh, Tracey and Kendall says thanks Chris. I was wrong. I was thinking sonic, but it is checkers

[02:35:36.960 --> 02:35:38.880]
We still love you Tracey. You're the best

[02:35:38.880 --> 02:35:44.900]
I was wrong. It's amazing how we're getting misinformation from some of our most trusted correspondents today

[02:35:44.900 --> 02:35:48.040]
Which is of course, which is good because it's helped to kill a whole hour here

[02:35:49.700 --> 02:35:53.580]
But no mole you might like sonic but it ain't round no mole

[02:35:54.040 --> 02:35:54.680]
Just like him

[02:35:54.680 --> 02:36:02.380]
Now what's all just happening or don't tell me I knocked the thing that's the audition line again. I hate when I get so animated

[02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:03.600]
David that I just

[02:36:04.300 --> 02:36:05.880]
Clang on that thing and knock it off the

[02:36:17.040 --> 02:36:19.240]
I went for new systems

[02:36:19.980 --> 02:36:22.340]
I was thinking about losing weight

[02:36:24.040 --> 02:36:29.080]
I stepped on the scale and I got a measure and say

[02:36:29.080 --> 02:36:35.600]
We said we need a mister is always so much that we can do

[02:36:37.240 --> 02:36:41.880]
I think life was searching for me the only thing for you

[02:36:43.580 --> 02:36:46.700]
I'm certain of my fighting on the right

[02:36:50.760 --> 02:36:52.520]
I'm sorry

[02:36:52.520 --> 02:36:52.520]

[02:37:05.320 --> 02:37:07.820]
I don't have to

[02:37:07.820 --> 02:37:10.800]
I don't have to go and dance

[02:37:10.800 --> 02:37:16.080]
I don't have the worry about no

[02:37:16.080 --> 02:37:18.580]
Vogue is around my fuzz

[02:37:19.500 --> 02:37:22.600]
Because life was such you know

[02:37:23.200 --> 02:37:25.360]
I'm a brand new man

[02:37:26.400 --> 02:37:28.200]
Look up the mover

[02:37:28.880 --> 02:37:31.760]
Fuck the fat out of splash you can't

[02:37:32.880 --> 02:37:34.860]
Fuck the fat out of my baby

[02:37:34.860 --> 02:37:38.120]
You can't suck the cell you bleed

[02:37:39.560 --> 02:37:41.460]
Something bad off my head

[02:37:46.000 --> 02:37:48.280]
Hey, suck the way you're around me

[02:37:52.660 --> 02:37:56.720]
I'm not going to step on the fat all the time so anyway sonic forget about it

[02:37:56.720 --> 02:38:00.960]
It's long gone ain't no sonic and date ain't no sonic and brown or ain't no sonic and Palm Beach

[02:38:00.960 --> 02:38:05.120]
Ain't no sonic no mole anywhere near any of you folks unless you listen, you know

[02:38:05.120 --> 02:38:09.140]
Listen on the internet. Mm-hmm. No dropouts today. All right

[02:38:10.340 --> 02:38:16.020]
Let's see here's an email on my mind space from somebody says jordanos jino's east and the others are all okay

[02:38:16.020 --> 02:38:18.760]
To very good but lu malnades and

[02:38:18.760 --> 02:38:20.520]
Duay are the best of the best

[02:38:20.520 --> 02:38:23.540]
lu malnades and pizzeria duay

[02:38:24.220 --> 02:38:27.680]
Says I agree with the people who say that pizzeria duay and jodanas can be inconsistent

[02:38:27.680 --> 02:38:32.080]
But then malnades is consistently good. It says don't go to any of the suburban locations

[02:38:32.080 --> 02:38:36.860]
Which are essentially franchises and where quality can be can very wildly to put it mildly

[02:38:37.300 --> 02:38:40.820]
Widenly to put it mildly always go to the mother church location to get the real thing

[02:38:40.820 --> 02:38:42.660]
Thanks very much whoever said that in for them

[02:38:42.660 --> 02:38:47.500]
So the deal is the real deal the real deal no punches pude is

[02:38:47.500 --> 02:38:49.720]
The lu malnades and pizzeria duay

[02:38:50.440 --> 02:38:55.460]
Uno duay train pizzeria train pizzeria quattro and yadda yadda yadda yadda yadda yadda yadda yadda yadda yadda yadda yadda

[02:38:55.460 --> 02:39:00.960]
So that was pretty exciting about all that sonic stuff, huh? Yes, it was but mystery salt boy. We're like the Scooby-Doo gang

[02:39:03.880 --> 02:39:04.200]
Oh

[02:39:05.960 --> 02:39:07.860]
Man, that was a zelma, huh?

[02:39:08.780 --> 02:39:09.320]
So how's the goani?

[02:39:10.000 --> 02:39:13.460]
Yeah, that's what I thought you said well at least we got off this stupid thing with these clichés anyway

[02:39:13.460 --> 02:39:16.560]
There was a great there was a great sonic. Oh, it was super sonic

[02:39:17.060 --> 02:39:19.860]
That's the way I would look at it when you say a little bit

[02:39:20.660 --> 02:39:25.560]
I'm positive that I never ate there, you know, I'm a just it just I mean I know I know what it looked like

[02:39:25.560 --> 02:39:29.420]
Because I remember having seen him what back in the day, you know, when I was there when I was forced to be there

[02:39:30.280 --> 02:39:32.920]
But I'm just positive. I never ate there

[02:39:33.860 --> 02:39:37.960]
Thousand ninety-one votes on the pool. I'm not going to a&w after the show, but I doubt it

[02:39:37.960 --> 02:39:40.500]
Well, they have the diet route here now, right? They do

[02:39:41.080 --> 02:39:45.080]
But they saw the story as soon they have it at the restaurant a&w makes diet route here

[02:39:45.080 --> 02:39:46.680]
Well, yeah, like in a real supermarket. Mm-hmm

[02:39:46.680 --> 02:39:51.260]
I don't really go to the real supermarket that often I have two of them very easy walking business if I want so lazy

[02:39:51.260 --> 02:39:58.020]
But it's just so much easier to go to like here. That's why they call it convenience store means everything is priced triple the ordinary price and you don't have to go too far

[02:39:59.060 --> 02:39:59.500]
lazy

[02:40:00.240 --> 02:40:05.380]
The dumbest expression that people say is I hate this pulls down to 18.8% let's hear it

[02:40:05.960 --> 02:40:06.780]
Not bad

[02:40:07.880 --> 02:40:09.060]
I hate this full toy

[02:40:10.160 --> 02:40:16.160]
Well, our goal was to get under 20% which was really scandalous and obnoxious two shakes of a lamb's tail 128

[02:40:16.160 --> 02:40:20.420]
Well, that would be good to order exotic two shakes and a lamb's tail if they have that

[02:40:20.420 --> 02:40:23.420]
I didn't have great milkshakes too. I

[02:40:23.420 --> 02:40:25.100]
I don't recall ever having one there

[02:40:27.300 --> 02:40:27.700]
I

[02:40:27.700 --> 02:40:30.240]
Thought that's one of the things they were really famous for the long. I'm sure

[02:40:30.940 --> 02:40:34.820]
What do you say Chris? Well Chris never went to Sonic. Did you yeah a couple times?

[02:40:35.060 --> 02:40:39.880]
You didn't know it's not too excited about it where the shakes is good as stake in shake. I don't think I ever had a shake there

[02:40:40.480 --> 02:40:47.080]
The stake the shakes at stake in shake are absolute phenomenal phenomenal not good sensational. They're okay

[02:40:53.560 --> 02:40:53.980]
You

[02:40:53.980 --> 02:40:54.580]
Who the fuck is

[02:40:57.100 --> 02:41:02.460]
You know this is a guy early in the week. He was kissing my fanny so bad talk about that bit. I just played

[02:41:02.460 --> 02:41:04.560]
I mean, I was like losing weight from it

[02:41:05.300 --> 02:41:10.600]
I'm picking a poke 89 never stole a freight train 78 and I think of Peter Paul Merriasing

[02:41:10.600 --> 02:41:16.240]

[02:41:16.240 --> 02:41:21.360]
I mean a lot of other people recorded it, but the way they do it the way they did everything Peter Paul and Harry

[02:41:21.960 --> 02:41:26.160]
Never stole a freight train 78 in a cool day 72 you don't have it. Oh, I'm afraid train

I never heard a demonstration 44 44 people just don't ever get out of the house

[02:41:37.540 --> 02:41:42.720]
They never interact with other people not a bad idea sometimes. You know what I mean 32 what do you think?

[02:41:43.020 --> 02:41:43.700]

[02:41:44.340 --> 02:41:47.780]

[02:42:03.960 --> 02:42:05.340]

Thanks for taking my call 14. Oh, I despise when they say thank you for taking my call

[02:42:11.160 --> 02:42:15.360]
I always say the same sarcastic thing. Thank you for making your call to go as well over the head

[02:42:15.360 --> 02:42:17.120]

As sharp as a marble eight nothing not for nothing seven good to go seven not hot to go but good to go

[02:42:45.820 --> 02:42:50.120]
You shouldn't shmit where you eat for who to thunk it for who did it who to

Make it snappy for is the Pope can't like three pack your patience three
