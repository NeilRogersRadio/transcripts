[00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.520]
The music's expressed on the previous programs are those of the hosts that have been out there.

[00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.720]
They stop that ring right now, okay? Cut the crap.

[00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:09.280]
The music broadcast has great. It's staff advertisers for agencies.

[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.000]
The biggest names, the best talent.

[00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.140]
What do you say, Chris? Can we have a little more anime here so I can hear the damn thing?

[00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.080]
So I think Robert's got a screenwriting score.

[00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.260]
Hey, Robert, get your pay right here. Right, though, William.

[00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:21.260]
The new QAM.

[00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:24.720]
Miami for the Lutterdale.

[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.660]
What I meant to say was Robert, you fair.

[00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:27.320]
Yeah, that too.

[00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.820]
You love acting Canada, you do bastard.

[00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.420]
This is I with this news.

[00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.340]
Kevin Arral, Schwarzenegger has taken some heat for saying his fanatic immigrants

[00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.400]
should avoid Spanish language media as a way to help them learn English.

[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:48.900]
I want to go from morning to night, work every day, seven days a week to get the message out there

[00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:53.000]
I will go from house to house knocking on doors, talking to families.

[00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.040]
Hey, you got the turn off the Spanish television set.

[00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.000]
Come on, stop. Turn off the Spanish television set.

[00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.960]
What? That's the love of Easter, baby.

[00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.000]
Hey, Crabble.

[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.820]
Well, I think the population of South Florida just decreased dramatically, don't you?

[00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.380]
Tell them I wanted 560 WK, we're here not for a long time.

[00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.260]
What was it that's sunny from the market used to say?

[00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.380]
We're here for a long time.

[00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.720]
And that's us today. We're not here for a long time today.

[00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.800]
Just for a good time.

[00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.100]
You know what the good news is? I sound just like me again.

[00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.560]
What Tuesday I was really off my feet.

[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.420]
What did you sell it like Tuesday?

[00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:35.940]
Crabble.

[00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.720]
Oh, Tuesday when they went home and sick it was good.

[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.760]
Although I was told it was a hell of a good show.

[00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.460]
Well good. I'm glad it was.

[00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:42.700]
I don't know what it's compared to what.

[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.360]
Probably it's compared to you.

[00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.720]
Now we're even for all that history.

[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.600]
You put me through this.

[00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.060]
You did a wonderful job there.

[00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.280]
George is the technical genius just asking him.

[00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.360]
If you have any problems in your house setting up internet or...

[00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.980]
Right.

[00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:58.000]
I can do it completely.

[00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.520]
...or TV or anything.

[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:00.820]
George will come there and like,

[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.260]
did it with all your life for a very reasonable price.

[00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.300]
No, he'll do it for free because he's a great guy.

[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.380]
So we got the Marlins and the Pirates weather permitting.

[00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.260]
And of course, the pregame will start at 11.30.

[00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:12.760]
It's not 11.35 right, Chris?

[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.080]
No, it's not 11.30.

[00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:15.300]
11.30.

[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.360]
Let me see it again.

[00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:17.160]
11.30.

[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:18.420]
Let's get it right.

[00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:19.220]
Clarence has...

[00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.800]
He's, you know, intellectually challenged as our program director.

[00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.900]
And of course, I got the time Jicca article here which little Tommy seems to know a whole bunch of stuff that allegedly is going on.

[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:34.800]
About how many mistakes can we make and how many mistakes can they make across the street and who's on first and who's getting bounced out.

[00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:36.960]
Defos out over across the street.

[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.660]
And you know, one thing we do know about Defo.

[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.880]
I mean, they'd not be great on the air but he's a really good...

[00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:43.580]
He's good at that.

[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.080]
Him and your good friend Marvin, the raw man.

[00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.520]
A guy who couldn't get out of bed in time to show up on time for a 10 o'clock in the morning job.

[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.020]
That's a really tough assignment. You know what Marvin?

[00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.980]
It's really clever.

[00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.780]
You talked him lately or is he lately?

[00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:58.020]
Yeah.

[00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:59.620]
Like in the last several years.

[00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:01.920]
Maybe several years, yeah.

[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.020]
But really lately, no.

[00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.240]
Well, what was the connection?

[00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:05.780]
Because he got...

[00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:06.560]
What was the deal with that?

[00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.700]
Did he eventually get canned or did they reassign him to something or when you started?

[00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.360]
In fact, you didn't replace him.

[00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:13.500]
Nick Lawrence replaced him, right?

[00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.940]
No, I replaced him but then he got a promotion.

[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.340]
Oh, because he was so inept.

[00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:20.340]
That's right.

[00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.900]
And was the hard-ass and did a butcher's car in the show.

[00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:25.660]
That's how they get rid of people.

[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:26.700]
Where did Nick Lawrence come in?

[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.780]
He was there before.

[00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:30.040]
He was there before Marvin.

[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:38.360]
But Nick Lawrence would do an eight hour board shift for you and Steve Kane in the afternoon.

[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.580]
That's when I started as a part-timer and I trained on both of your shows very briefly.

[00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:43.500]
Well, what about you?

[00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.880]
You got credit.

[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.820]
That has to do with your side of the glass over there.

[00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:46.220]
That's right.

[00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:55.700]
And then Nick Lawrence became, you know, the exclusive producer for Steve Kane and Marvin was brought in to be your producer exclusively.

[00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.300]
Yeah.

[00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.360]
Then it would mean because of Marvin's spectacular performance.

[00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.300]
He was promoted off of your show and I replaced him.

[00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:05.820]
Because he was such a whale of a job.

[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:11.400]
Anyway, here's the poll result from yesterday and thanks to me, George had a phenomenal result.

[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:11.800]
Look at that.

[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:21.320]
The way that thing is floating, there's like a big blob off the coast.

[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.400]
And I think the browner in Palm Beach is going to get most of it.

[00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:26.420]
But there'll be some rain.

[00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:28.560]
So go out to the ballpark.

[00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.200]
Somebody's got to go and get soaked.

[00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.700]
Take a rubber rain coat, take an umbrella, take a poncho, rubber raft.

[00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:38.100]
I'll never forget at a dolphin game many years ago.

[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.020]
The fat man, fat rich in hour with the game and it was pouring cats and dogs.

[00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.600]
Another reason that it's really great to go to these sporting events live.

[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.340]
And it was against San Diego as a matter of fact, against the charges.

[00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:51.540]
What a memory I got.

[00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:58.220]
And so some fans loan the poncho, you know, so I wouldn't get pneumonia.

[00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.640]
You know, so because we're out there in the stands and it's pouring cats and dogs during most of the game.

[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.360]
So, you know, I was very grateful and I thanked them like crazy.

[00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:06.580]
But it was one of those real cheap.

[00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.700]
It wasn't the money thing that was worth something, you know.

[00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:16.140]
And when the game ended, as we're waddling out, waiting out in the parking lot to try to find fat rich's car,

[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:20.440]
these guys come racing out, oh, hey Neil, how much you've been to the set, poncho back.

[00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:22.440]
That's right, you thief.

[00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.420]
I mean, nothing had a cross to least 50 cents, sure, huh?

[00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:29.780]
Anyway, here's the poll result from yesterday.

[00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:30.960]
Today, George is great, Paul.

[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.320]
And boy, I put him over the top, I've skirted this the day before.

[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.340]
This is a good poll, you don't like it?

[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:37.940]
It's fine, it's great.

[00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:38.640]
Well, it's your bet.

[00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:43.000]
And when I head on Tuesday, I'll tell you that, that crap about when you're relative's croak, what are they doing?

[00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:43.580]
So, whatever.

[00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:45.640]
That's my favorite because I didn't have to think of it.

[00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:46.340]
Right.

[00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:49.860]
What I hate most about summer is the heat 423.

[00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:51.780]
That's an old drinker, the heat 423.

[00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:53.560]
I thought they played in a winter time.

[00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:58.280]
Neil's part time schedule 284, well, I would hardly disagree with that.

[00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.900]
In fact, I got an hour and a half, I got an hour and a 24 minutes today to 1130.

[00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.420]
Yeah, a toilet to break a sweat, would you?

[00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:05.100]
Yeah, break this.

[00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:10.320]
Hurricane season 238, I love summer 146 while I love a two.

[00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:12.020]
And of course, this schedule is part of that.

[00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:14.720]
That's my motto, more pay less work.

[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:18.320]
Everybody I've said, you'd be doing yourself a real good favor if you were in that lesson.

[00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.820]
Lot more pay and a lot less work.

[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.040]
Lots of vacation and things like that.

[00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:25.820]
All that end kids out of school 102.

[00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:28.180]
No sports except baseball, 53.

[00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:29.720]
And we know how boring baseball is.

[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:31.100]
Don't forget that Marlon Pirates game.

[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:35.360]
They're going to have a whale of a crowd between the weather and the fact that it's a noon game,

[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.200]
12-05 start on a Thursday afternoon.

[00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:40.160]
See, they keep trying to dilute themselves, I guess.

[00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:43.880]
Chris, wouldn't you think this is because the pirates are going to have like a travel thing or something?

[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.580]
That's what I'm guessing, yeah, I didn't see who they're going to have to do with the West Coast or something like that.

[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.180]
Because the Marlon's ain't going nowhere.

[00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:52.240]
They got the braids coming in this weekend.

[00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:53.360]
Looks like to me on the schedule.

[00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.380]
Anyway, no sports except baseball, 53.

[00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:57.480]
And what's life without sports?

[00:06:58.320 --> 00:06:59.760]
The afternoon's storm is 39.

[00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:01.520]
We'll have some of those today, at least, too.

[00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:03.460]
Well, the sun is shining here, ain't no storms here.

[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:04.380]
It's just beautiful.

[00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:05.860]
Wow, it's lovely.

[00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:07.620]
And family vacations are already 7.

[00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:11.980]
I guess it can be a real pain in the ass, depending on, you know, kind of people in your family.

[00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:15.900]
If your family are a bunch of slime balls, then who wants to go on vacation with them?

[00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:18.180]
Here's today's pool.

[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.260]
And we're not going to get no thousand today.

[00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:23.780]
Now, this is one that just, I don't know what to say about it, but I just made it up.

[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:25.880]
It's okay.

[00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:26.860]
It's timely.

[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:29.720]
The Paris Hilton story, blank.

[00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:31.460]
629 vote.

[00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:34.120]
We might line up with a thousand by, I mean, eventually we will.

[00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:36.440]
633.

[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:37.580]
You see they're coming in big chunks.

[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:41.220]
I mean, if we could get to a thousand by a lot of 30, that would mean we'd have this huge audience,

[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:42.680]
which once upon a time we did.

[00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:43.480]
Remember those days, George?

[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:44.300]
What?

[00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:44.700]
Who?

[00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:47.100]
That was a long time ago.

[00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:53.240]
And also the good news is that the River House in Fort Lauderdale is doing our 50% off deal,

[00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:56.700]
starting at noon today on wdqm.com.

[00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:59.220]
And so as a result, they're coming in 1030 with food for you guys.

[00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:00.300]
I'll keep you posted.

[00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:05.560]
We're duff's working on getting the store open a little bit earlier so that it's, you know, more in common with the show.

[00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:06.260]
Right.

[00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:07.060]
But I'll let you know.

[00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:08.640]
Let me know.

[00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:09.040]
Yeah.

[00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:12.320]
And I don't know if I talked with you about this because you were out sick on Tuesday.

[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:15.740]
You know, it's the food that's coming in today and George is as fine as one.

[00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:19.380]
Although he was, you know, yesterday I wasn't really sure whether you'd be in because we were,

[00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:23.400]
we were deliberating about that for the ass end of the show on Tuesday.

[00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:25.260]
What the guys would do if you didn't want to.

[00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:26.820]
And I told him, don't call me.

[00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:27.260]
Right.

[00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:28.420]
Don't call me.

[00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:29.180]
Forget about it.

[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:32.820]
I mean, you know, I'm a trooper and I like to be a game player and all other team player.

[00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:35.160]
I want one of those tapes that are all crazy about that.

[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:40.200]
Look how many of the old tapes about alien, little alien hero and is a happy meal and stuff like that.

[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:42.180]
And just, you know, try to keep up with the dump button there.

[00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:45.520]
Anyways, so I was telling you about that diabetic neuropathy, you know,

[00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:49.460]
which after I had lunch yesterday, I had a little bit of that again.

[00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:49.640]
Yeah.

[00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:52.840]
And then went away again by hour before that's a scary thing.

[00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:53.840]
Talk about a wake up call.

[00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:56.520]
So you can talk about ice cream and all kinds of crappy food.

[00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:58.240]
Anything you want as long as you want.

[00:08:58.300 --> 00:08:58.960]
And ain't going to happen.

[00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:00.020]
This is a very narrow.

[00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:01.800]
I am at, well, the narrow part.

[00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:04.380]
Anyway, strict atkins now is I think I've ever been.

[00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:07.100]
There are no refined carbs going to pass my mouth.

[00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:09.740]
It's just big, they kill you.

[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:11.360]
That's incredible to me.

[00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:12.240]
Yeah, wow.

[00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:13.780]
No, no start.

[00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:14.700]
He's got his own issues.

[00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:15.940]
Okay, according to Tom Jicke.

[00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:19.060]
And Jicke puts it his frame where in his blog story he says,

[00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:21.760]
this closure Goldberg is a casual friend.

[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:25.640]
Oh, little time you are a real panic, you know.

[00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:28.100]
Goldberg is a casual friend.

[00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:32.060]
I mean, just, does anybody believe casual is the appropriate word?

[00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:33.280]
And they want to think about Tom Jicke.

[00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:34.540]
He's body stupid.

[00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:34.920]

[00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:36.560]
639 votes.

[00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:39.760]
The Paris Holt and Story proves most people are morons to 88.

[00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:42.960]
Proves the media is insane 279.

[00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:46.400]
In fact, I think a good way to describe that.

[00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:48.880]
The media is sick and you talk badly.

[00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:52.440]
279, those between those two they got 78% of vote.

[00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:55.340]
Yeah, the Paris Holt and Story is pondered with 53.

[00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:58.140]
It's interesting, 11, and it is very important.

[00:09:58.240 --> 00:09:59.340]
We important, they ate.

[00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:03.460]
Now, granted, I did create this poll and I put those choices on there.

[00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:05.280]
But why would it be very important?

[00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:06.760]
Can anybody answer that?

[00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:07.560]
Nope.

[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.500]
More important, they're eight.

[00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:13.160]
Well, you know, since they are comedy votes.

[00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:16.300]
And I feel so much better since we don't do that.

[00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:17.360]
I hate this poll anymore.

[00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:18.060]
Remember those two?

[00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:18.460]
Yeah.

[00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:20.720]
I hate that question.

[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:21.600]
I'm bad at it.

[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:22.260]
And I hate it.

[00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:23.060]
Yeah, it was my bad.

[00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:25.840]
I will fess up to having done that really badly.

[00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:26.800]
But I was bad news.

[00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:27.900]
I hate this poll.

[00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:30.020]
It's just an outlet for a bunch of mouth contents.

[00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:33.800]
By the way, nice hearing from my buddy Mike from FSU finally.

[00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:34.960]
Mike is one of those guys.

[00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:36.440]
But you always tell me this.

[00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:41.320]
That he always responds to my emails on my space thing.

[00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:43.680]
But, you know, he's, first of all, he's like 21.

[00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:44.680]
He's a college student.

[00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:45.280]
He's a young guy.

[00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:47.040]
He's getting a lot of action, as you can imagine.

[00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:51.700]
And he's not going to sit on there and write long stuff back and forth.

[00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:53.660]
You know, like a regular whatever.

[00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:54.120]

[00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:58.400]
Like my really, really loyal correspondence out there, which you know who they are.

[00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:01.700]
But anyway, he's so anyway, I got a nice message from him this morning.

[00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:05.360]
He's, and he went to where I did his study in London for a few weeks.

[00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:06.320]
He never made it to Amsterdam.

[00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:07.520]
Oh.

[00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:10.680]
And never got to poop in his pants in Amsterdam either.

[00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:12.720]
Which I think, you know, I think everybody in their lifetime.

[00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:15.620]
And of course, there are a lot of reasons when you're in Amsterdam to poop in your pan.

[00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:16.740]
Yeah, I heard that story.

[00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:19.760]
He said his friends went over there and told him it was a really strange city,

[00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:20.600]
which I would agree with that.

[00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:21.920]
And also that the food was great.

[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:27.220]
Which means they must have been extra hungry.

[00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:29.340]
And one can only imagine why they were extra hungry.

[00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:30.760]
You would understand that.

[00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:31.380]
Ah, ah, ah.

[00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:32.020]
Yeah.

[00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:36.640]
Anyway, 12 minutes after 10, we better talk fast because we're out of here at 1130 sharp.

[00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:39.260]
Better come up with some music to go into the Volgae music.

[00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:41.100]
Yeah, we'll even get that whole line.

[00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:45.580]
Well, also, you know, with the crap they gave me Tuesday, Miguel and Chris.

[00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:50.940]
And I was shocked because I played it twice and there's, oh, no, nobody wants to do that anymore.

[00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:52.140]
Oh, the reader book thing.

[00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:52.380]
Yeah.

[00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:54.860]
Now, you would agree with it because they said you would be like,

[00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:56.480]
Well, when I came in, I got an earful.

[00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:59.560]
See, I was on vacation and everything and I came back and I was going to read it.

[00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:02.980]
And everybody just like body tackled me like, don't you don't, you're not going to believe how many times they'll

[00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:03.960]
played it while you were gone.

[00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:04.500]
Just stop.

[00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:05.440]
Stop already.

[00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:06.200]
All right.

[00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:07.000]
I'm not tired of it.

[00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:07.800]
But yeah, okay.

[00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:09.920]
So there you go.

[00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:10.780]
Okay.

[00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:13.320]
Well, I only played four times between 9 and 1130.

[00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:13.820]
No problem.

[00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:15.180]
And then we should be right up to the Volgae.

[00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:20.920]
12 minutes after 10 at 560, WNG, we got the Amarling and Pirates game at 1130 pregame.

[00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:24.460]
Curtis is on after the baseball game.

[00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:27.080]
Humber is at the NBA drag preview four o'clock.

[00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:31.000]
Or all of it says, that's the NBA drag preview show, I guess, because they're not going to be at the AAA.

[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:32.200]
Correct.

[00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:32.900]
Is that correct, Chris?

[00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:33.340]
Correct.

[00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:33.880]
Whatever.

[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.020]
The Humber is on 4 to 7.

[00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:36.320]
Three solid hours for the Humber.

[00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:36.620]
That's good.

[00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:37.720]
Work off some of the calories.

[00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:41.880]
Miami Dolphins all access 79 and 88 game night 9 to 1 tonight.

[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.580]
That's our award-winning schedule.

[00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:46.100]
This is the most disgusting program.

[00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:46.620]
Yeah.

[00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:49.700]
I urge everyone to complain to this station.

[00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:50.480]
Absolutely.

[00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:52.120]
Ow!

[00:13:58.360 --> 00:13:59.920]
Oh, man.

[00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:01.140]
Why do you mind?

[00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:03.780]
Let's hit this hard to pay tonight.

[00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:07.080]
Driven by silk painting.

[00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:08.860]
Oh, my woman here.

[00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:11.420]
Here's the goal of Mitchell's head.

[00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:12.840]
I will die here.

[00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:14.900]
Let's show you the world.

[00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:16.800]
Who's the boss of the beer.

[00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:18.740]
I turn in everybody.

[00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:19.680]
We're in the middle of the night.

[00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:19.680]

[00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:19.680]

[00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:19.680]

[00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:19.680]

[00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:19.680]

[00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:19.680]

[00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:19.680]

[00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:19.680]

[00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:19.680]

[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:35.620]
Yeah.

[00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:35.920]
Yeah.

[00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:35.920]

[00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:35.920]

[00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:35.920]

[00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:35.920]

[00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:37.180]
Yeah.

[00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:40.740]
Yeah.

[00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:40.740]

[00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:40.740]

[00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:41.220]
Yeah.

[00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:42.680]
Yeah.

[00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:47.440]

[00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:47.820]
Yeah.

[00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:48.020]

[00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:48.020]

[00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:48.020]

[00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:48.020]

[00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:48.020]

[00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:48.920]

[00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:49.460]

[00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:49.460]

[00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:49.460]

[00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:49.460]

[00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:49.460]

[00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:49.460]

[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:49.600]

[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:49.600]

[00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:49.640]

[00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:03.840]
Yeah.

[00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:07.060]

[00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:07.540]

[00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:07.840]
Yeah.

[00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:10.220]
Yeah.

[00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:10.220]

[00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:10.220]

[00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:10.840]
Yeah.

[00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:10.840]

[00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:10.840]

[00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:10.840]

[00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:11.160]

[00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:11.160]

[00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:11.160]

[00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:11.160]

[00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:11.160]

[00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:11.180]

[00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:11.180]

[00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:11.180]

[00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:11.180]

[00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:11.180]

[00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:11.180]

[00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:12.040]

[00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:12.460]
Yeah.

[00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:12.540]
Yeah.

[00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:12.920]

[00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:14.040]

[00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:14.040]

[00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:14.160]
Yeah.

[00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:14.220]
Yeah.

[00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:15.720]
I'm looking at this Miami radar.

[00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:20.140]
And there's this huge yellows and reds and dark greens and blues.

[00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:23.760]
And it, but it's, it's kind of like going in a Northwesternly.

[00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:24.440]
It's offshore.

[00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:25.660]
Most of it.

[00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:28.400]
I mean, is it raining there right now or you're sitting in the station?

[00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:30.040]
I don't know.

[00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:32.520]
Well, I mean, it could be, it could be, it could be hailing.

[00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:34.260]
It could be raining balls of fire.

[00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:35.700]
Maybe it is raining balls.

[00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:36.520]
Oh, boy.

[00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:37.500]
Lothballs.

[00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:38.920]
Open wide.

[00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:43.200]
Anyway, it looks to me like they'll be just fine.

[00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:45.840]
And of course, I wouldn't pay any attention that because I couldn't care less.

[00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:48.660]
Not that I'm not sympathetic to all you poor bastards are going to get like drenched.

[00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:51.120]
But it's just, you know, we got to get that ball game in.

[00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:56.940]
We love the marlins when they play early and especially today.

[00:15:57.580 --> 00:16:00.760]
I think this is like one of maybe only two that they do this all year.

[00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:03.820]
Would they start like a 1205 and nobody has any idea why.

[00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:05.580]
But I still think it's a pirate's travel day.

[00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:07.380]
Maybe there'll be a bananza.

[00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:10.240]
Maybe it'll be like a 19 inning, you know, extra inning game.

[00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:10.740]
Mm-hmm.

[00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:11.920]
Go on until midnight.

[00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:13.880]
Well, screw the pirates anyway.

[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.460]
What a horseball franchise that is.

[00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:19.760]
You know, even though we try to avoid sports like poison on this show as much as we can,

[00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:21.440]
I don't know if we ever did that.

[00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:26.700]
The worst sports franchise in America today is.

[00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:30.200]
Or the most pointless, you know, I don't know how you would phrase that.

[00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:30.520]
You know what I mean?

[00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:31.660]
Chris, most pathetic?

[00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:33.740]
The most pathetic sports franchise.

[00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:34.460]
That's good.

[00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:35.160]
Pathetic.

[00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:36.460]
There's one for you, George.

[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:37.520]
Oh, yeah.

[00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:39.280]
Let me wrap this up around that.

[00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:40.000]
Yeah.

[00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:42.960]
The Paris Hilton story is we have 685.

[00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:45.620]
I wouldn't be surprised if by the bottom of the air we get to 700.

[00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:49.240]
I think we're in a shock America today, because we only got an hour and nine minutes to go.

[00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:50.400]
Not that I'm counting you understand.

[00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:54.500]
The Paris Hilton story proves most people are morons 311.

[00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:56.960]
Proves the media is insane.

[00:16:57.620 --> 00:16:58.000]
302.

[00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:01.180]
I'm just wondering how come I'm on the city pulsar and not on CNN.

[00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:02.220]
Is there any special reason?

[00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:05.800]
Maybe because I'm a word they're going to put Ricky Tickey santa's on here.

[00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:09.320]
Oh, just in, Supreme Court limits use of race to decide public school assignments.

[00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:11.060]
Oh, that's a racial thing.

[00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:13.920]
We don't want to start with no racial thing, because both campers might be listening.

[00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:18.100]
And he'll come back on here next week, assuming he's back on here next week.

[00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:20.980]
He'll say, you know, Clinton, I said, you know, cool or something on here.

[00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:24.360]
Paris Hilton proves most people are morons 311.

[00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:25.420]
Proves the media is insane.

[00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:28.020]
302 is ponderous 54.

[00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:29.740]
Oh, that's the understatement of the century.

[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:31.400]
It's interesting 11.

[00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:33.180]
Oh, there's a story about me bald and beautiful.

[00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:34.080]
There's the American eagle.

[00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:34.620]
Isn't that cute?

[00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:36.600]
And it's very important.

[00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:39.160]
How come that eagle, that bird is so tame?

[00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:43.500]
Can you really domesticate like wild birds like that?

[00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:46.720]
Domesticate might not be the right word, but you can get them used to you.

[00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:49.880]
Oh, especially if you feed them a lot of crap.

[00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:50.660]
Yes.

[00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:55.040]
Is interesting 11 and is more important to eight, still the same idiots.

[00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:56.400]
We're just trying to be wise guys.

[00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:57.040]
We don't understand.

[00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:58.300]
They saw Jackass too.

[00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:01.100]
Oh, it by the way, before I get into this jicke thing,

[00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:03.160]
guess what movie?

[00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:06.720]
Thanks to the chicken egg, although the disc again this week was extremely lame.

[00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:09.780]
But nevertheless, that one I just played that gay bomb.

[00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:10.700]
That's it.

[00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:16.040]
But he's, you know, he's undergoing a lot of, I talked with the jolly joe bell about him the other day.

[00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:20.020]
And jolly joe says, oh, there's another check for him just came in and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

[00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:22.900]
And I said, just take care of him when you're okay and get him off my back.

[00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:25.660]
You, whatever Hank said about you was right, Joe.

[00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:26.240]
That's what I said.

[00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:30.080]
But anyway, so guess what I watched yesterday afternoon?

[00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:30.760]
Sick argument.

[00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:34.160]
Well, why don't you got it right?

[00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:38.000]
Well, since I sent both of them to you, I didn't get to sicko yet.

[00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:38.740]
I want to say it.

[00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:39.840]
It'll make you sick.

[00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:42.020]
I'll tell you one thing, James Franco is sure look good in there.

[00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:42.940]
I'll say it in a very minute.

[00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:43.760]
Remember all the controversy?

[00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:47.480]
Everybody said that it sucked and I said it was just fine so now you can decide.

[00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:48.240]
It sucked.

[00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:48.860]
Okay.

[00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:50.600]
It sucked lemons.

[00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:51.920]
It was bad.

[00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:54.380]
It was way, way too long.

[00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:55.180]
Okay.

[00:18:55.380 --> 00:19:01.660]
All those special effects, especially in the beginning, was that the one with the Sandman or was that the one?

[00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:03.040]
I don't even remember.

[00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:05.160]
But anyway, it was just too much.

[00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:06.800]
I mean, you could see it was going on.

[00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:07.880]
I've always been a complain.

[00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:08.920]
What?

[00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:09.920]
Too much in a movie.

[00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:11.020]
Yeah, that's going to bother me.

[00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:19.400]
You know, whatever you had on Tuesday, yeah, I know, I know.

[00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:20.440]
It's going to come back.

[00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:21.780]
Hopefully tomorrow.

[00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:21.960]

[00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:22.680]
So I don't have to work.

[00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:23.780]
Oh, well, good luck.

[00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:25.960]
Chris and Chris and Miguel are going to film the movie.

[00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:26.640]
Every day weekend.

[00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:27.420]
I'm sure they will.

[00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:27.960]
It sucked.

[00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:29.280]
It was just, all right.

[00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:32.480]
It just, I mean, I never got you it, by the way.

[00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:33.200]
Never watched it.

[00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:33.740]
Really long.

[00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:36.980]
Now your friend is quite heroic towards the end there.

[00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:38.740]
Oh, is it really a lot of nature?

[00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:40.420]
I don't really care how I wrote it.

[00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:42.260]
James Franco, you mean my friend?

[00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:42.820]
Yeah, yeah.

[00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:43.120]
You're both.

[00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:44.680]
I mean, how looking young guy, that's my friend.

[00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:45.420]
I only wish.

[00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:47.020]
It sounds like a plan to me.

[00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:47.580]
Hey, give me.

[00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:48.780]
Special friend.

[00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:51.420]
My most special friend.

[00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:52.200]
Yeah, he looked really good.

[00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:55.100]
The reason I say that is because I've said this before too.

[00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:55.800]
He's one of those guys.

[00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:56.880]
Like, I'm interested and as old.

[00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:58.200]
He looked really good in that movie too.

[00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:01.240]
And then sometimes he's in movies and looks like crap.

[00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:03.060]
Well, I guess they run out of makeup or something.

[00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:04.000]
Low budget.

[00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:08.100]
So here's this email I got yesterday from one of our regular

[00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:09.760]
Ojón provocateurs out there.

[00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:10.860]
It says, welcome back from vacation.

[00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:11.800]
Hope you had a good time.

[00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:14.040]
Yeah, I had a good time except I pooped my pants.

[00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:18.020]
The reviews on Phil Henry's news show are overwhelmingly negative.

[00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:18.600]
Are you sure?

[00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:20.760]
He's doing straight political talk.

[00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:22.760]
His show is on from 1 to 4 a.m. Eastern time.

[00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:25.660]
And W.I.N.Z is airing a delayed from three to six in the morning.

[00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:26.620]
Oh my God.

[00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:29.700]
There are rumors that ManTalk's six, four, he's also negotiating to get him.

[00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:30.220]
Wow.

[00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:31.740]
Won't that be a further than their cap?

[00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:32.660]
They can improve on that point.

[00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:33.860]
Oh, oh, oh.

[00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:37.100]
He has very few stations nationwide in W.I.N.Z.

[00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:39.240]
The only major station to get him.

[00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:41.220]
I.N.Z is still a major station.

[00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:42.340]
It was a long time ago.

[00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:45.280]
Anyway, it says, have you seen Jicke's blog from today?

[00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:46.380]
It's just in case here it is.

[00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:47.100]
And you know what I did?

[00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:49.060]
Although I printed this out and it came out fine.

[00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:54.840]
But I was going to go to the Sun Sentinel and find Jicke's blog.

[00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:56.020]
I can't even find where it is.

[00:20:56.660 --> 00:20:59.100]
I looked under all Jicke's articles and whatever.

[00:20:59.320 --> 00:20:59.880]
I couldn't find it.

[00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:04.080]
So thanks very much to whoever this mysterious, so this is the palm tree guy.

[00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:05.140]
You know the Miami palm tree guy.

[00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:08.260]
So after the break, I'll read the Jicke's piece and it'll be time for the ball game.

[00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:10.180]
And be time to check the weather.

[00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:12.260]
I think one of you during the break should go and look out the window.

[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:13.740]
I don't think probably.

[00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:14.060]
Huh?

[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:14.580]
Okay.

[00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:16.480]
I don't think Chris is there.

[00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:17.340]
Are you going to do it or is your...

[00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:17.680]
I'll do it.

[00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:18.480]
Chris will do it.

[00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:19.600]
He needs the exercise.

[00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:20.960]
We got 700 votes.

[00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:22.380]
What did I tell you by the bottom of the arm?

[00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:23.260]
Man, I am amazing.

[00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:24.780]
I'm just asking.

[00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:28.960]
You don't have a little bit of that flame left over from Amstu there.

[00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:30.640]
I think it's flame.

[00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:33.880]
26 after 10 at 5, 60 WQA.

[00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:48.660]
I'm a last birthday.

[00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:51.900]
Oh my god.

[00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:54.300]
Daddy bought me a doll.

[00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:57.660]
And he told me to play.

[00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:03.400]
I wonder what.

[00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:03.860]

[00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:03.860]

[00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:03.860]

[00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:10.080]
Daddy said, if you knew I got 69 emails today,

[00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:18.440]
but my name, my name, my name, my name, my name, my name, my name, my name, my name.

[00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:25.160]
I got out of prison, oh in 1982.

[00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:34.780]
I was called at the playground with a kid or two.

[00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:44.360]
Now I use the next email them today.

[00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:52.780]
And tomorrow I'm wet because her name, her age, her face is posted on my face.

[00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:55.200]
My face.

[00:22:56.300 --> 00:23:01.080]
Hey baby, you know you're really mature for your age.

[00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:04.280]
How about we meet in person?

[00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:06.380]
Get off this silly chat.

[00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:09.760]
I'll bring you beer and I'm supposed to.

[00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:14.000]
Well now, I don't tell your mom I'm a little bit of man to stand your knees.

[00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:16.940]
I tell you what they love, love, will get dead.

[00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:19.680]
You got a rude party smile, you know that?

[00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:22.140]
Yeah, I'll tell you what.

[00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:25.860]
Let me tap them all.

[00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:29.720]
Oh, me and the video shop.

[00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:35.060]
Well just don't tell your folks.

[00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:39.480]
And just ask them don't tell the cops.

[00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:41.860]
Whoa.

[00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:46.040]
He said I'm one and a man.

[00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:46.860]
That's right.

[00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:50.720]
All he said was I was pregnant and fell.

[00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:51.320]
That's me.

[00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:55.720]
My age, my face, my face.

[00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:57.200]
My face.

[00:23:58.320 --> 00:23:59.100]
My face.

[00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:02.600]
He's got a lot of money left and all the long places.

[00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:04.620]
He's not in now.

[00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:06.500]
He didn't know I wore a bracelet.

[00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:11.280]
I suppose all the right places I guess.

[00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:13.580]
10, 33, 24, I'm a better talk fast.

[00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:15.780]
We got that vlog and I'm here in the Neko now.

[00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:16.420]
Bad.

[00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:17.760]
What's that all about?

[00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:20.200]
You don't hear that?

[00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:21.540]
No.

[00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:24.380]
Yeah, I'm getting an echo back from you guys.

[00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:25.420]
Real bad.

[00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:26.760]
I don't have the stint turned up real like a man.

[00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:29.120]
Well, we've been fiddling.

[00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:32.180]
Well, whatever you've fiddled man, oh there it is.

[00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:32.840]
The echo went away.

[00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:34.460]
Somewhat, it's still there a little bit.

[00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:35.200]
Although I like that.

[00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:35.920]
It's like reverb.

[00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:37.180]
Okay.

[00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:40.280]
It's like the old days of great radio man.

[00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:42.520]
Reverb like on W-A-B-C.

[00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:44.700]
In places like that, a Kener 13.

[00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:45.600]
Things like that.

[00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:46.200]
Real radio stays.

[00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:48.640]
Why are you doing that?

[00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:49.460]
What?

[00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:52.020]
In addition to all that belonging about it.

[00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:54.840]
So Yelton told me that this thing is clear now?

[00:24:55.140 --> 00:24:55.400]
No.

[00:24:57.180 --> 00:25:02.340]
There's a problem we're going to have to address it after the show with your dump button.

[00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:04.240]
There's a problem with it?

[00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:05.260]
It stays on.

[00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:06.980]
It's like continuously dumping.

[00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:10.380]
So it was happening on the year?

[00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:15.260]
Yeah, so they disconnected the signal coming from you.

[00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:15.620]
Yeah.

[00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:16.920]
Well, what is that?

[00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:17.880]
Okay, yes.

[00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:19.340]
Affirmative.

[00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:20.600]
I, laddie.

[00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:22.420]
How could we even be on the air if that was happening?

[00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:25.020]
Wouldn't the audience be all 10 people out there be having a fit?

[00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:26.340]
I'm sure they are.

[00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:27.360]
Well.

[00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:30.580]
Here's a music for up to the ballgame by the way.

[00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:32.660]
Okay.

[00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:34.460]
I'm not messing around.

[00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:35.100]
I want to hear that.

[00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:37.720]
So anyway, getting back to this fact that I started on.

[00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:39.760]
I don't know how I can afford the luxury of this.

[00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:43.520]
717 votes on the full, by the way, where our goal is what Chris?

[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:44.880]
A50 by 1130?

[00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:45.620]
Sounds good.

[00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:46.860]
Yeah, no chance.

[00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:49.640]
It says, have you seen jikas blood from today yet?

[00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:51.200]
No, and thank you very much for sending it in.

[00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:55.220]
More shakeups in local sports talk is the headline on Little Tommy's column.

[00:25:55.660 --> 00:25:58.720]
The chaotic state of local sports talk, radius undergoing another upheaval.

[00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:00.080]
Oh my god.

[00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:00.800]
Upheaval.

[00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:03.500]
I was told you during all day on Tuesday.

[00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:05.700]
The echo went away by the way.

[00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:05.900]
Good.

[00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:08.680]
Did you do something?

[00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:09.100]
No.

[00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:10.060]
No, you did.

[00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:13.040]
I thought Yelton said, we're clear now or something like that.

[00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:13.680]
That was a lie.

[00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:15.120]
Why do you lie?

[00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:17.100]
He thought we were at the time, but we're not.

[00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:17.720]
Oh.

[00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:19.740]
Well, how about if I hit the dumb button?

[00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:20.600]
Then I'll just be cool.

[00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:21.080]
No, it won't matter.

[00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:22.580]
Is that a bad idea?

[00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:23.400]
You've been disconnected.

[00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:24.940]
Oh, good.

[00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:30.240]
It says, remember how Michael Conrad used to send out his forces in Hill Street Blues?

[00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:32.180]
Let's do it to them before they do to us.

[00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:35.720]
Laxi, seven-nighter of the ticket, is adopted as strategy with Joe Rose.

[00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:40.580]
The popular former dolphin has steadfastly refused to reveal the station's plans

[00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:42.560]
when his contract runs out of hand to August.

[00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:46.440]
The widely held belief, his roses headed back to WQAM AM 560,

[00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:49.340]
to become the morning drive host, his role at the ticket.

[00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:52.260]
That would sound like Kenny and Boar toast.

[00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:52.900]
Oh.

[00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:55.100]
So effective July 9.

[00:26:56.820 --> 00:27:00.220]
The ticket is moving Sid Rose and Virgo to morning drive from 5.39 AM.

[00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:01.940]
What a way to wake up that would be, huh?

[00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:02.860]
Oh my god.

[00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:06.800]
Isn't that what you want here first thing in the morning, a summer loud obnoxious New Yorker?

[00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:07.480]
Oh boy.

[00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:09.280]
Rose now works 7 to 10 AM.

[00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:10.100]
How do boy Tom?

[00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:15.240]
The idea is to get listeners out of the habit of listening to roses on the drive to work just in case wink wink.

[00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:16.780]
He's really moving to WQAM.

[00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:18.400]
Oh, wouldn't that be something if he was?

[00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:23.080]
The working blueprint, everything in local sports talk is done on etch-a-sketch.

[00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:26.700]
Has Rose working 9 AM to noon and Boob Shombie sliding back to noon to 2?

[00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:28.260]
I thought Boob Shombie was leaving.

[00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:29.640]
Over there.

[00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:31.440]
That's what I heard.

[00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:37.280]
Jason Jackson will work 2 to 4 followed by Dan LaBanstered in his normal 4 to 7 p.m. slot.

[00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:38.420]
Who are these people?

[00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:42.340]
Jeff DeForest, now on 5 to 7 AM, is the odd man out.

[00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:44.300]
Boy, you're writing both parts on that little Tommy.

[00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:45.440]
He's odd and he's odd.

[00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:48.900]
He, you know, Steve Nichol destroyed him.

[00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:51.100]
Remember my saying that and I would, it's true.

[00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:52.520]
I thought he was ever great.

[00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:55.220]
But he was, you know, he was listenable and he was all right.

[00:27:55.380 --> 00:27:55.780]
He, you know.

[00:27:56.540 --> 00:27:59.560]
But once Steve Nichol got him and doing all that corn ball stuff, boy.

[00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:01.900]
He just became unlistenable.

[00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:03.200]
DeForest.

[00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:07.360]
And even when you look at all the angst that we went through and there were all those rumors

[00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:10.280]
we were going to bring him back, we wouldn't bring him back if he paid us to work here.

[00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:11.700]
I don't want you to feel bad about it.

[00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:12.800]
DeForest is the way it is.

[00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:18.340]
Coincidentally, Rose and DeForest used to host WQM's Morning Drive program with Steve Goldstein,

[00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:23.780]
whose talk show future is also problematic because the Florida Panthers room he does play by play

[00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:25.960]
will not be back at WQM next season.

[00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:27.340]
No more of those point.

[00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:28.600]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

[00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:29.040]
What is it night?

[00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:33.440]
If and when Rose does jump back to WQM, he will again work 7 to 10 a.m.

[00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:38.680]
However, the hefty salaries expected the command to result in another shakeup with Hank Goldberg.

[00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:39.500]
Hey, stupid.

[00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:41.700]
A fixture would look, let me hear that again.

[00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:42.400]
Hey, stupid.

[00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:44.340]
Did that sound right to you?

[00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:45.440]
Hey, hey, stupid.

[00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:49.580]
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, stupid.

[00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:54.200]
With Hank Goldberg, a fixture in local sports talk for a court of a century named National

[00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:57.580]
Unknown Personality from his work on ESPN, possibly leading the station.

[00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:00.440]
They're going to bump the hump.

[00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:07.300]
Or Goldberg's contract runs out the end of the WQM and QAM, whose budget is strained by its new

[00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:11.320]
dolphin deal as well as what will have to pay Rose, is trying to lowball him in a new deal.

[00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:15.100]
This closure, Tommy, says Goldberg is a casual friend.

[00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:18.540]
That was fun.

[00:29:18.580 --> 00:29:19.340]
Casual My Ass.

[00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:24.020]
It's easy to lose the station thinking if you can't resign Goldberg.

[00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:26.660]
And then here's the part that just drives me up the wall.

[00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:31.360]
Jim Mandage, who's now in the relatively unimportant 2 to 5 p.m. block, the final hour working with Goldberg,

[00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:40.060]
could move back to the 4 to 7 p.m. drivetime shift and someone at a much lesser and someone at a much lesser salary than Goldberg could be plugged into 4 to 7.

[00:29:40.060 --> 00:29:41.140]
The savings might even pay for Rose.

[00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:48.360]
You know, they move Mad Dog back where he belonged at 2 o'clock, where he did great all that time.

[00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:52.240]
And now we're going to do it again and keep moving them around like pieces on the chest board, baby.

[00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:53.160]
Keep moving them around.

[00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:54.640]
When it doubt, move them on out.

[00:29:56.540 --> 00:29:58.060]
God, can you even believe that?

[00:29:58.300 --> 00:29:58.400]
Yeah.

[00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:01.520]
And we discussed this briefly before the show.

[00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:07.640]
Before George let me do all that stuff about the iPod and the iTunes and looney tunes and what.

[00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:10.860]
I know you don't want to comment on that because it's not.

[00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:11.480]
They're the best.

[00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:12.460]
I know I know the Skeldi.

[00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:12.460]

[00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:13.220]
They're the best.

[00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:24.640]
I know the Skeldi was doing live spots this morning out with Kenny.

[00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:26.840]
I mean, he's not even on that show.

[00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:28.180]
Guess again.

[00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:29.760]
Guess again what?

[00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:30.440]
He is on the show?

[00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:31.000]
Is it me?

[00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:33.640]
I mean, he's on the show this week.

[00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:35.100]
He's not like he's pro.

[00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:36.440]
How can he be permanently on the show?

[00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:39.440]
Well, I think he has a standing thing every time he does a show.

[00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:41.540]
He does home lenders or something like that.

[00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:43.180]
No, it's Richard Rubel.

[00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:44.880]
Isn't that Richard Rubel at home?

[00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:45.660]
I don't know.

[00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:47.240]
I'm not doing promotions for anybody else.

[00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:48.720]
We got the main man for Cranow.

[00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:50.860]
I'm going to start promoting other people's sponsors.

[00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:52.880]
Jesus, Chris, are you dumb or what?

[00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:53.820]
I'm sorry, don't answer.

[00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:56.100]
730 on the poll by the way.

[00:30:56.180 --> 00:30:56.820]
Now what's this thing?

[00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:58.300]
Oh, the story is open now.

[00:30:58.380 --> 00:30:59.480]
Thank goodness for the new River House.

[00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:03.340]
The half-off certificates on there at wqm.com.

[00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:05.600]
So you better grab those now because those are going to go really fast.

[00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:08.060]
We're having all of these things that you see listed there.

[00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:09.200]
Oh, look at that menu.

[00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:13.660]

[00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:15.680]

[00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:20.380]
Panflash, dayboats, e-scalops, Oak grilled beef, tenderloin.

[00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:21.300]
And you have all of this?

[00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:22.720]
And then look at the desserts.

[00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:24.880]

[00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:27.740]
Layers of flavored chocolate, Nuget and cherry.

And the River House carrot cake.

[00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:29.660]
Mmm.

[00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:35.580]
Anyway, River House is at 301 South Dakota.

[00:31:35.580 --> 00:31:36.360]
That's what's 301 South Dakota.

[00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:38.780]
And for a lot of people, anybody who doesn't know where the River House is,

[00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:41.020]
has never been out of their home, I guess.

[00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:42.200]
Legendary.

[00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:44.120]
Not as legendary as I am, but then again, who is?

[00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:48.620]
So the store is open at wqm.com and you can hop those up right now.

[00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:49.400]
How many we got?

[00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:49.960]
Do we have 100?

[00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:50.920]
Yeah.

[00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:51.880]
We do.

[00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:53.800]
You did great last week.

[00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:55.440]
Well, I tell you, what was it the last week?

[00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:57.920]
The fish house.

[00:31:58.660 --> 00:31:59.100]
Blue moon.

[00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:00.240]
Yeah.

[00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:00.620]
Blue moon.

[00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:05.280]
And those things went out like Halavai in Tel Aviv, man.

[00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:05.980]
Anyway, how fast?

[00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:08.300]
And you can say Paris Holtens is a slut.

[00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:11.460]
Twenty before 11 at 560 WQM.

[00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:11.920]
And the Roger.

[00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:12.280]
Huh?

[00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:14.380]
Your job's grab authority.

[00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:19.680]
560 WQM presents the Hank and Joel's MacDowls.

[00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:20.440]
MacDowls.

[00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:22.120]
MacDowls.

[00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:26.160]
And this one, uh, Joel's a deadly spell.

[00:32:27.220 --> 00:32:32.040]
And this one, uh, Hank wears my cheddar cheese.

[00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:34.180]
Cheese makes me feel better.

[00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:35.440]
Oh, boy.

[00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:39.040]
Hey, your mother f***er.

[00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:42.120]
Stupid.

[00:32:43.180 --> 00:32:45.300]
You dumb mother f***er.

[00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:46.400]
You know, wait a minute.

[00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:51.840]
Am I, as you understand, that the mother f***er that you're referring to is me?

[00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:52.960]
That's right.

[00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:55.740]
Oh, well, I don't have to take that from you.

[00:32:56.180 --> 00:32:59.200]
Now you just stand right there while I straighten my tie.

[00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:05.040]
Yeah, you got any idea what would happen if I closed my fat ass?

[00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:06.320]
No, you tell.

[00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:08.000]
I'd break your tongue.

[00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:10.560]
You have fat banjo strum and brown.

[00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:11.860]
I love and heck.

[00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:13.920]
Who's calling me fat?

[00:33:15.020 --> 00:33:18.420]
You and Bruce Beasley should have f***ed babies together.

[00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:20.080]
What seems to be the problem with you?

[00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:22.160]
Maybe there's something I won't do about it?

[00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:23.440]
I'm cold.

[00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:25.180]
So turn to thermostatic.

[00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:26.620]
That's your job.

[00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:27.600]
Do, boy.

[00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:28.340]
Do, boy.

[00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:29.300]
That's right.

[00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:30.680]
Do as I say.

[00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:32.140]
I'm cold.

[00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:33.380]
Where are sweater?

[00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:34.680]
You're not cold.

[00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:37.140]
I'm cold.

[00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:38.820]
I'll punch you.

[00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:41.100]
Go ahead, throw your best shot.

[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:43.040]
My fist is stuck.

[00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:46.440]
Removia fist from my fat fold.

[00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:47.060]
Try.

[00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:52.500]
And while you're at it, get me a pillow.

[00:33:52.980 --> 00:33:56.580]
You know, I would swear that I just heard the fat jolly joke called Hank Juboy.

[00:33:56.580 --> 00:33:57.380]
Did you guys hear that?

[00:33:57.540 --> 00:33:57.680]
No.

[00:33:57.900 --> 00:33:58.020]
What?

[00:33:58.420 --> 00:33:58.860]
Yeah, you did.

[00:33:59.060 --> 00:33:59.620]
I didn't hear anything.

[00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:00.460]
I'm like Chris heard it.

[00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:01.220]
Did you hear him say that?

[00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:03.760]
Juboy asked toaster if he heard it.

[00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:03.980]
Okay.

[00:34:04.460 --> 00:34:08.100]
752 votes, by the way, we've already sold 19 of those certificates for the River House.

[00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:11.040]
That's pretty exciting to watch that, you know?

[00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:11.420]
Yeah.

[00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:15.620]
15 dollars and if it gets for only 25 bucks, you save half off and you can buy up to five of them.

[00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:18.700]
So if I was used, I'd, you know, I'd get at least a couple of them anyway.

[00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:19.500]
How about you?

[00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:20.540]
No, not me.

[00:34:21.140 --> 00:34:27.260]
Paris Hilton's story, 752 votes proves most people are morons, 343, proves the media is insane,

[00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:34.320]
334, is pondress 55, is interesting, 11, and is more important than we had another one of those now.

[00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:36.540]
Very important story.

[00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:39.800]
You're listening to Neil Rogers.

[00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:43.980]
So before we hit the wrong damn thing that I was bad.

[00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:46.100]
Well, you know, we don't have much time today.

[00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:49.900]
Under a lot of stress, nine out of 752 votes.

[00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:52.200]
What did I say we ought to get by 11, 30, 850?

[00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:52.640]
I don't remember.

[00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:52.820]
Yeah.

[00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:55.560]
And I think we had a practice for going to the Volga University.

[00:34:57.400 --> 00:34:58.320]
Practice makes perfect.

[00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:03.780]
A man who said he would walk with a headache only to finding had been shot in the head, called authorities, he was away.

[00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:05.400]
I can't talk to this story.

[00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:06.460]
This is an important issue.

[00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:09.340]
What word did you say, people in Portia, Lucy?

[00:35:10.740 --> 00:35:11.420]
It's right here.

[00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:12.280]
Oh, man!

[00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:14.100]
God, I love that song. Don't you love that song?

[00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:14.580]

[00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:15.000]
Yes, I do.

[00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:18.580]
Anyway, getting back to this April and Moilin 39,

[00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:22.420]
sleeps with a load of 32 caliber revolver under Pelosi, coupled with over the 30s.

[00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:26.600]
When the burglar went off four o'clock Tuesday morning, we've gone accidentally discharged,

[00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:30.820]
and the bullet hit Michael U. Jean Moilin 45 just behind his ear.

[00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:35.540]
The couple said that they couldn't call 911 because both of them are felons,

[00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:37.020]
and aren't supposed to have a gun.

[00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:39.820]
So they made up the headache story of 30 City yesterday.

[00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:40.880]
Oh, that was creative.

[00:35:41.860 --> 00:35:44.680]
Michael Moilin was recovering Wednesday at a hospital.

[00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:48.220]
His wound was not considered life threatening, currently sent loosely to county sheriff's office.

[00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:51.520]
April Moilin was charged with possession of a firearm by convicted felon,

[00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:54.160]
and was in custody yesterday or bail was set at 75 grand.

[00:35:55.420 --> 00:35:56.860]
Yeah, he woke up with a bad headache.

[00:35:57.440 --> 00:35:58.280]
It's all it was.

[00:35:59.900 --> 00:36:02.340]
754 votes on our world famous poll about Paris Hilton,

[00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:04.840]
which nobody with a brain should waste more than a half a second,

[00:36:05.020 --> 00:36:07.120]
thinking about that needle-nosed helmetless bitch.

[00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:09.600]
Yeah, so she was born into a lot of money.

[00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:10.600]
She inherited a lot of money.

[00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:11.800]
And what else?

[00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:12.700]
Does she look good?

[00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:15.220]
So she made the porno video, big deal, so did Ron Jeremy.

[00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:19.280]
You, and like I said yesterday, when you were out or were Tuesday,

[00:36:19.660 --> 00:36:20.940]
she at least she looks better than him.

[00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:23.780]
Been met again so it was my ass.

[00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:28.480]
Speaking of my ass, three former leaders of a ministry that counsels gazed

[00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:30.540]
to change their sexual orientation apologized,

[00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:33.020]
saying that although they acted sincerely,

[00:36:33.020 --> 00:36:36.120]
their message could have caused isolation, shame, and fear.

[00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:38.620]
All of these things.

[00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:42.280]
The former leaders of the Inter-Nomodational Christian Organization,

[00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:45.200]
Exodus International, said yesterday they'd become disillusioned

[00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:46.580]
with promoting gay conversion.

[00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:50.040]
It's kind of like converting black people to being white.

[00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:53.160]
You know, a lot of bleeds can't hurt, but I don't think it's the job done.

[00:36:54.580 --> 00:36:56.920]
Some will hurt our message, we're compelled to try to change it.

[00:36:56.980 --> 00:36:59.600]
Integral part of themselves bringing harm to themselves and their families.

[00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:03.160]
The three said, and they statement released outside the L.A. gay and lesbian center.

[00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:07.800]
The statement was from former Exodus co-founder Michael Bussey.

[00:37:08.060 --> 00:37:09.840]
You know, let me just inter-work the story.

[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:11.500]
We don't really need this duck button here.

[00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:13.060]
Can I just take the button right out of here?

[00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:14.300]
You could.

[00:37:14.740 --> 00:37:16.020]
Because I can tell you guys to do it.

[00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:17.340]
We got a whole bunch of time in here.

[00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:22.840]
Not like some of us don't know when and, you know, why we should be pressing that button.

[00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:27.460]
So in other words, the final decision is in my hands.

[00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:28.660]
That's not the way it works at all.

[00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:31.100]
So what I'm saying, I know when to dump something.

[00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:33.420]
Yeah, but you're not always there.

[00:37:33.540 --> 00:37:34.800]
What if you're not there like on Tuesday?

[00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:36.760]
You think me go, those when to dump something?

[00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:37.340]
Good luck to you.

[00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:39.580]
You know, to speak English for Christ's sake.

[00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:39.860]
Yes.

[00:37:40.060 --> 00:37:40.720]
Those when to dump it.

[00:37:40.780 --> 00:37:41.120]
Don't you, Chris?

[00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:43.180]
I admit Chris has dumped a few in his time.

[00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:44.460]
Correct.

[00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:47.100]
When you eat that much, you had a few dumps in your lifetime.

[00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:48.060]
Believe you me.

[00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:49.420]
But I was made it to the bathroom.

[00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:51.680]
At least you weren't wearing your pants at the time.

[00:37:52.900 --> 00:37:55.160]
At least not, you know, I'll buckle up.

[00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:59.400]
The statement was from former co-exodus co-founder Michael Bussey.

[00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:02.280]
I wonder if he's kind of the great harness driver Don Bussey.

[00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:03.500]
Or Gary Bussey.

[00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:04.880]
Or Gary Pussy.

[00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:10.320]
Who left the group in 79 in Jeremy Marx form president of Exodus International in Europe and Darleen Vogel.

[00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:13.420]
The founder of ParaCleat Ministries in Exodus V for Allegiance.

[00:38:13.740 --> 00:38:17.700]
The statement coincided with the opening of Exodus's annual conference, which is being held this weekend,

[00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:20.260]
Concordia University in Irvine, California.

[00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:22.780]
And of course that's named after the great Don Irvine, Jr.

[00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:27.980]
Exodus president Alan Chambers said the ministry's methods have helped many people including himself.

[00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:31.820]
Exodus is here for people who want an alternative to homosexuality Chambers said by phone.

[00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:34.160]
There are thousands of people like me have overcome this.

[00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:39.780]
I think there's room for more than one opinion on the subject and giving people options isn't dangerous, he'd be saying.

[00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:40.420]
You're fair, right.

[00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:46.300]
Founded in 76th-year Orlando based Exodus has grown to include more than 120 ministries in the US and Canada,

[00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:48.280]
and over 150 ministries overseas.

[00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:54.260]
And from what's freedom from homosexuality through prayer, counseling and group group therapy, isn't that wonderful?

[00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:56.540]
The group group, I can't wait.

[00:38:56.760 --> 00:38:59.300]
Hey, maybe if James wants his name, Franco is in the group.

[00:38:59.940 --> 00:39:01.920]
I sure take a group at that, I'll say that.

[00:39:02.220 --> 00:39:03.700]
That will be sucks Spider-Man 3.

[00:39:03.820 --> 00:39:05.000]
Now what about you Chris, you seen it?

[00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:08.180]
I thought it was long, but you know I watched the whole thing.

[00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:10.140]
It was okay, it was just long.

[00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:11.660]
It was okay.

[00:39:12.020 --> 00:39:13.440]
Yeah, but not good.

[00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:14.400]
Correct.

[00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:16.380]
Not nearly as good as the first two.

[00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:18.320]
No, the second one was great.

[00:39:19.020 --> 00:39:19.640]
Second one was sensation.

[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:21.940]
The second one was the definitive one at the end of that.

[00:39:21.980 --> 00:39:22.640]
That should have made it.

[00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:24.840]
Finito, see some of these guys never know what to quit.

[00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:29.100]
They're making them the dreams that they never know what to quit and then they want to get in can and pan.

[00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:34.920]
I read a lot of the reviews on IMDB after I stopped watching that thing after the first 17 hours of it.

[00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:37.360]
And a lot of people agreed with me that it really sucked.

[00:39:37.620 --> 00:39:38.920]
It was incredible.

[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:39.740]
I thought it was just fine.

[00:39:40.700 --> 00:39:44.280]
Well, when they ended fine, they closed everything up at the end, they tied everything down, it was just fine.

[00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:46.680]
Okay, good, which means there isn't going to be a Spider-Man 4.

[00:39:47.180 --> 00:39:49.480]
There might be, but with different people and it won't be the same thing.

[00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:52.700]
It's good as he was in the first two and I'm not a fan of his at all.

[00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:57.160]
He gives me shfilquies, but he was horrible in us when he was really bad.

[00:39:59.140 --> 00:40:00.080]
That's just my opinion.

[00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:02.100]
Okay.

[00:40:03.660 --> 00:40:04.640]
Oh, here's that guy.

[00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:06.580]
He's the the dark, conflicted guy.

[00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:09.020]
He's the youngest person to fly solo around the world.

[00:40:09.060 --> 00:40:10.140]
You didn't think he was small enough.

[00:40:10.140 --> 00:40:10.960]
23 years old.

[00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:11.840]
No, I've done it.

[00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:15.580]
Do you think there are other kids out there who feel the same way?

[00:40:15.700 --> 00:40:16.180]
Isn't that great?

[00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:20.440]
I wonder what, I bet you're what's your name would have fallen around the world if she would have survived.

[00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:21.140]
What's her name?

[00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:22.600]
The Died Net Playing Crash in the World?

[00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:22.980]
Jessica.

[00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:25.100]
No, yes.

[00:40:25.740 --> 00:40:26.420]
Child pilot.

[00:40:26.620 --> 00:40:26.820]
Right.

[00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:28.820]
Something, Jessica, something.

[00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:29.300]
Child pilot.

[00:40:29.420 --> 00:40:30.760]
That was always Joe Castillo's favorite.

[00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:34.280]
We were talking about him on Tuesday.

[00:40:34.540 --> 00:40:35.480]
He wouldn't believe what Chris said.

[00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:39.080]
He only was seven when she got dirty.

[00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:39.860]
Was it Jessica?

[00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:42.360]
I don't remember.

[00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:42.900]
Of course it is.

[00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:44.940]
And I can't even see he's been dead a long time now.

[00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:47.500]
Because he was an ego thing for mommy and daddy.

[00:40:47.620 --> 00:40:49.040]
And they did have that big screen TV.

[00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:52.240]
763 on our world famous pool.

[00:40:52.380 --> 00:40:53.460]
We don't have a lot of time here now.

[00:40:53.560 --> 00:40:54.800]
Let me look at that Miami radar.

[00:40:55.020 --> 00:40:55.700]
Okay, it's a good idea.

[00:40:55.780 --> 00:40:58.040]
We're trying to keep you up to date whether to go to the ballpark.

[00:40:58.180 --> 00:40:58.540]
I'd go.

[00:40:58.920 --> 00:40:59.220]
Oh, yeah.

[00:40:59.260 --> 00:40:59.880]
It looks good outside.

[00:41:00.820 --> 00:41:01.540]
Does it look good?

[00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:02.380]
Yeah.

[00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:05.740]
And there's some great clouds, but over the stadium, there's a lot of blue and white clouds.

[00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:09.660]
Yeah, because we're just down the Hershey highway there from the stadium down to Ives-Dury Road.

[00:41:10.660 --> 00:41:14.480]
And so you could you could throw a rock from where you're sitting and probably hit somebody in the ball.

[00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:16.640]
Well, if there was a crowd, which they won't be today.

[00:41:17.620 --> 00:41:23.680]
And then like I said, that thing is spinning around like a dreidel that whole system off the coast.

[00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:27.220]
And it looks like it's going to really get there like north-broward and Palm Beach mostly.

[00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:29.600]
And most of it is avoiding Dave County.

[00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:32.800]
Well, that's because the people in Dave County got really sucked a week or two ago.

[00:41:32.900 --> 00:41:33.600]
And how was that?

[00:41:34.740 --> 00:41:36.240]
Broward didn't give much of anything that day.

[00:41:36.300 --> 00:41:37.100]
I got so confused.

[00:41:37.460 --> 00:41:41.280]
I mean, you're I asked you a question like that and you're the ones that are supposed to be there.

[00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:42.580]
I'm not going to be supposed to be out of touch.

[00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:43.940]
Yeah, you know what scene is here.

[00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:45.300]
And it's like, oh, we don't know.

[00:41:45.820 --> 00:41:48.100]
What does either do this yellowfin tuna meat right now?

[00:41:48.580 --> 00:41:50.580]
Of course, you live in Hollywood anyway.

[00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:51.820]
Chris lives in Dave County though.

[00:41:52.060 --> 00:41:52.560]
That's correct.

[00:41:52.900 --> 00:41:53.560]
How very sad.

[00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:54.580]
You're eating what now?

[00:41:54.820 --> 00:41:55.440]
Dolphin tuna?

[00:41:56.360 --> 00:41:57.080]
Yellowfin tuna.

[00:41:57.120 --> 00:41:57.740]
Yellowfin tuna.

[00:41:58.140 --> 00:41:59.220]
Shave the elephant tuna.

[00:42:00.220 --> 00:42:01.640]
I wonder who shaved the tuna.

[00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:04.140]
And I wonder if they used a bicker.

[00:42:04.140 --> 00:42:06.660]
One of those real fancy ones that courtes.

[00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:08.580]
85 blades.

[00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:11.640]
I'll tell you what sounds really good to me as the Sicilian shrimp.

[00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:12.560]
Mmm.

[00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:14.960]
With peppers, tomatoes, chilies.

[00:42:15.180 --> 00:42:17.320]
I better take a look and see how many of those certificates we have left.

[00:42:19.660 --> 00:42:21.680]
Because I think it would be a real feather in our cap.

[00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:24.140]
If we sold them all out, like in about the next week before the book.

[00:42:24.380 --> 00:42:27.180]
Now, what you do is you go to wqm.com and then on the left side,

[00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:30.040]
where it's got that picture of the pirates winning the game last night.

[00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:31.940]
That's a shame in the 10th inning.

[00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:33.120]
We've already sold the video right.

[00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:35.320]
I want to show my ugly face underneath it says open now.

[00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:36.080]
That's the store.

[00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:36.420]
Okay.

[00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:39.900]
And you click on that experience areas, best businesses that have price.

[00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:40.700]
And look at that.

[00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:41.760]
Only 49 left.

[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:43.920]
They're going fast.

[00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:47.400]
They're going like, like I said, like hotcakes in North Carolina.

[00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:50.800]
Flapjacks in Louisville.

[00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:53.900]
Well, that's another thing you can't eat when you die better.

[00:42:54.020 --> 00:42:54.600]
Do you realize?

[00:42:55.600 --> 00:42:57.300]
And of course, I have nobody to blame but myself.

[00:42:57.640 --> 00:43:00.540]
And people who are not diabetic, they don't understand it.

[00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:01.220]
They haven't got a clue.

[00:43:01.220 --> 00:43:02.240]
They think it's all a big joke.

[00:43:02.540 --> 00:43:03.200]
Oh, come on.

[00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:04.400]
You have some more than ice cream.

[00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:05.360]
How about some hotcakes?

[00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:06.440]
Like that crap.

[00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:10.840]
And once you, when you first get that diabetic neuropathy for the first time,

[00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:12.200]
hopefully for the last, I hope.

[00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:13.640]
But boy, that's scary stuff.

[00:43:14.540 --> 00:43:18.420]
And if like pins and needles tingling in your hand, in fact, my right hand was like one day,

[00:43:18.660 --> 00:43:19.920]
I had like a frozen finger.

[00:43:20.940 --> 00:43:21.260]
Really?

[00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:21.720]
How to taste?

[00:43:22.340 --> 00:43:24.020]
I don't know, but I know it comes in handy.

[00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:24.400]
Back home.

[00:43:24.620 --> 00:43:25.960]
In some cases, but look.

[00:43:26.980 --> 00:43:28.400]
I could have been proctologist for a day.

[00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:29.500]
I'm always queen for a day.

[00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:30.080]
That's any day.

[00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:31.720]
I could have been proctologist for a day.

[00:43:32.140 --> 00:43:33.700]
So early on 49 left, they're going to go out.

[00:43:33.820 --> 00:43:38.300]
I bet you close to ballgame time, but those river house things are going to be gone.

[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:40.700]
And you know, it's tough.

[00:43:40.900 --> 00:43:41.180]
How happy.

[00:43:41.300 --> 00:43:42.000]
She is about all this.

[00:43:42.100 --> 00:43:44.140]
She's just happy in a pig and slop.

[00:43:44.260 --> 00:43:44.700]
Yes, he is.

[00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:45.800]
Is she really?

[00:43:45.980 --> 00:43:46.160]
No friends.

[00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:46.680]
Yes, he is.

[00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:48.140]
1057 at 5.

[00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:49.020]
So how's the food?

[00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:50.240]
By the way, what's Chris so much about?

[00:43:50.620 --> 00:43:50.920]
It's great.

[00:43:51.060 --> 00:43:52.640]
You know, if your queen has rupt in me, I'd get some of this down.

[00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:52.900]
You know?

[00:43:53.500 --> 00:43:54.080]
Okay, go ahead.

[00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:55.820]
This is the Neal Roger show.

[00:43:55.820 --> 00:43:57.580]
ストストスト got .2.

[00:43:57.840 --> 00:43:58.680]
This is your queen.

[00:43:58.840 --> 00:44:25.700]
Yes,anie's like this.

[00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:00.820]

[00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:25.700]

[00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:30.640]
Hey, hey, she is too race. She'll be shaking hands around the town.

[00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:36.600]
The white house, she is too vibrant. She is Washington down.

[00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:42.020]
She just wants to be friend with that. The public and she thinks she can be.

[00:44:42.900 --> 00:44:47.620]
But they don't want them on Clinton. On the fence of England, have a history.

[00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:53.440]
11.02.56.2 WQM. Talk real fast because we only have 28 minutes and we're counting baby.

[00:44:53.580 --> 00:44:59.620]
We are counting. 40 certificates for River House at half price. That's pretty good.

[00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:02.780]
Now there is this way when last week, how many did you have last week for the blue moon?

[00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:05.520]
We had 50 of them last week. Like we had 50.

[00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:10.740]
And they sold out fast and you wanted to eat dumplings in Louisiana.

[00:45:12.060 --> 00:45:14.240]
What are dumplings? Are like dumplings like...

[00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:19.640]
It's dough that you put into, yes, exactly. Except with white flour instead of mozzo meal.

[00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:22.560]
Instead of mozzo meal?

[00:45:22.940 --> 00:45:24.960]
Instead of mozzo meal, man. Yeah.

[00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:29.320]
It's like dough. It's like white balls of dough and you dump them into the soup.

[00:45:29.340 --> 00:45:30.600]
White balls of fire? Yeah.

[00:45:31.220 --> 00:45:35.360]
Dumplands? Sounds like redneck food to me. Just like biscuits, baby.

[00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:39.740]
Biscuits and gravy. Oh, man. Maybe that's why rednecks are like how they are.

[00:45:39.740 --> 00:45:42.680]
You know? Too many biscuits and too much gravy. I would like gravy.

[00:45:44.120 --> 00:45:46.820]
I was starting to say about all the different things that I can not eat.

[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:49.820]
I mean, not never ever again, but I mean for a very long time.

[00:45:50.140 --> 00:45:50.760]
How about escargot?

[00:45:51.500 --> 00:45:53.380]
Why can't I have escargot? You enjoy that right now.

[00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:55.500]
You know I'm having an escargot pot pie.

[00:45:55.720 --> 00:45:57.760]
Well, I could not eat the pot pie part. See?

[00:45:58.300 --> 00:46:01.020]
It's like when you're diabetic and you have any brains and you eat pizza.

[00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:02.920]
You take a fork and eat the toppings.

[00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:04.680]
You eat the pizza. Oh, it's not making me rune.

[00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:05.160]
That's right.

[00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:09.220]
I need to eat the crust because that's where we find carbs are, baby.

[00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:11.780]
That's where the evil doers are in those carbs.

[00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:15.120]
By the way, say basil, fed California escargot pot pie.

[00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:21.220]
They feed it basil with fennel, spinach, and all my cheese,

[00:46:21.860 --> 00:46:23.240]
truffle essence, and pastry topping.

[00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:24.240]
Who the hell say an Andre?

[00:46:25.240 --> 00:46:27.380]
Once you get to the French stuff where you leave me cold, I don't know,

[00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:30.180]
but it's delicious. If it's good, I'll get like the French onion soup.

[00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:31.960]
It's phenomenal. My very favorites.

[00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:33.800]
Do you know anybody who doesn't like that? Not me.

[00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:35.240]
Chris?

[00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:37.000]
No. I mean, the good stuff.

[00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:38.840]
It's like, like, like, like the Gourney Meebord, say,

[00:46:38.860 --> 00:46:39.740]
only if it's the good stuff.

[00:46:40.600 --> 00:46:41.960]
Let me take a look at that thing again.

[00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:44.720]
39, so we only have 39 of those certificates left for the River House.

[00:46:44.860 --> 00:46:46.380]
I've grabbed them right now. I just stop them up.

[00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:47.200]
That's what I would do.

[00:46:47.960 --> 00:46:50.300]
Here's a story that I'm sure warms the cockles of your heart

[00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:53.540]
because you hate them almost as much as I do.

[00:46:54.140 --> 00:46:58.060]
Farmer Orlando, boy band manager, Lou Proman was indicted yesterday

[00:46:58.060 --> 00:46:59.640]
about federal grand jury. I beg your pardon?

[00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:01.440]
I'm sorry right the wrong button.

[00:47:04.220 --> 00:47:06.460]
I think that escargot is starting to get to you.

[00:47:06.780 --> 00:47:10.380]
Lou Perlman was in bed the yesterday by federal grand jury accused of scheming to defraud

[00:47:10.380 --> 00:47:13.140]
federally insured banks out of over a hundred million dollars.

[00:47:13.260 --> 00:47:13.580]
Hey Lou!

[00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:14.400]
You're fairy!

[00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:18.880]
With the five count of debt and change a charged problem with three counts of bank fraud

[00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:23.520]
and single counts of mail and wire fraud and details only twenty million loans from Evansville

[00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:25.200]
and the end of base in Tegrobank.

[00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:29.960]
The bank sued Perlman and his company Transcontinental Airlines in December accusing them of using

[00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:34.680]
bogus accounting documents to secure sixteen million dollars in loans and three million dollars

[00:47:34.680 --> 00:47:39.340]
in credit in September of 2004 and another 952 grand in personal loans in August and September

[00:47:39.340 --> 00:47:39.920]
of last year.

[00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:45.560]
The charges come as Perlman who turned fifty three last week as in the midst of a Transcontinental

[00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:49.900]
trip with US Marshals to be returned to Orlando to face a bank fraud charge.

[00:47:51.500 --> 00:47:55.440]
Deputy US Marshal Eric Thompson supervises in the Orlando office didn't know Perlman's

[00:47:55.440 --> 00:47:58.840]
were about other than to say he was in transit and in a holding facility.

[00:47:59.180 --> 00:48:00.260]
He's holding it.

[00:48:00.260 --> 00:48:01.420]
Wouldn't be the first time.

[00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:06.160]
He's flying the friendly skies courtesy of the US Marshal Thompson said Perlman was arrested

[00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:11.820]
June 15th in Guam after Indonesian authorities netbe agents tracked him to a luxury hotel

[00:48:11.820 --> 00:48:13.500]
on the travel resort of Bali.

[00:48:13.860 --> 00:48:14.340]
All right.

[00:48:15.540 --> 00:48:19.280]
He was deported to a square out of the country on the US bound plane by the same FBI agents

[00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:20.680]
armed with a bank fraud arrest warrant.

[00:48:20.820 --> 00:48:24.720]
His capturant in a nearly five month odyssey that took him halfway around the world by

[00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:28.380]
creditor lawsuits piled up and state and federal probes and was business dealing scheme

[00:48:28.380 --> 00:48:29.100]
momentum.

[00:48:29.700 --> 00:48:29.700]

[00:48:30.020 --> 00:48:34.780]
Luke Perlman always had a feeling about him.

[00:48:34.780 --> 00:48:35.740]
You know, I mean, not a good feeling.

[00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:39.000]
Always had my doubts about that child.

[00:48:39.980 --> 00:48:41.140]
He liked those boy bands.

[00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:42.380]
He had a little bit too much.

[00:48:43.020 --> 00:48:43.800]
You could have thought about that.

[00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:44.760]
I know why I like that.

[00:48:44.840 --> 00:48:45.400]
I like some of them.

[00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:45.540]
Yeah.

[00:48:45.580 --> 00:48:46.480]
He likes them for the same reason.

[00:48:47.640 --> 00:48:50.520]
Yeah, but I think he might have been doing it the way they sound.

[00:48:50.520 --> 00:48:51.280]
I was the only fantasy.

[00:48:51.460 --> 00:48:52.740]
Sounds they make with their mouth.

[00:48:54.700 --> 00:48:56.320]
I don't think those are the kind of sound.

[00:48:56.320 --> 00:48:58.300]
No, those aren't the ones he liked.

[00:48:58.460 --> 00:48:59.900]
I mean, those are the ones we were hearing on the record.

[00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:01.440]
Hey, let's never some pretty good crap.

[00:49:01.580 --> 00:49:04.760]
Don't knock Nicholas Shagun just because he had his ex-wife on your show.

[00:49:05.100 --> 00:49:05.100]

[00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:07.720]
I wish I had a certain thing.

[00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:09.080]
793 votes.

[00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:11.520]
I think I don't know if we're going to get the 850 by the bottom of the yard.

[00:49:11.580 --> 00:49:12.120]
What do you think, Chris?

[00:49:12.780 --> 00:49:13.440]
Yeah, we're going to do it.

[00:49:13.960 --> 00:49:14.280]
850?

[00:49:14.600 --> 00:49:14.920]
Yeah.

[00:49:15.820 --> 00:49:18.020]
As if it makes a big difference.

[00:49:18.180 --> 00:49:18.380]
Let's see.

[00:49:18.540 --> 00:49:19.300]
The store is open now.

[00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:20.940]
Just checking this thing to see how we're doing.

[00:49:21.560 --> 00:49:22.280]
36 left.

[00:49:23.300 --> 00:49:24.020]
NeilRodgers.com.

[00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:25.040]
$50 certificates.

[00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:28.240]
Only 25 bucks at the River House in Fort Lauderdale.

[00:49:29.380 --> 00:49:30.100]
And what are you eating, Chris?

[00:49:30.260 --> 00:49:30.820]
I asked you before.

[00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:31.780]
I didn't really eat.

[00:49:31.780 --> 00:49:36.000]
Beef, tecagloin with made-up cheese and potato thingy.

[00:49:36.660 --> 00:49:36.820]
Mm.

[00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:40.760]
Like I was starting to say, boy, too bad I can't eat anymore.

[00:49:41.340 --> 00:49:42.360]
I think I should just stop eating.

[00:49:42.840 --> 00:49:43.320]
That's a good idea.

[00:49:43.320 --> 00:49:45.020]
I would solve a lot of my problems.

[00:49:45.940 --> 00:49:47.160]
Not that I have any problems.

[00:49:47.260 --> 00:49:48.480]
I'm trying to think, do I have any problems?

[00:49:49.220 --> 00:49:50.560]
Well, the dump button is screwed up.

[00:49:50.700 --> 00:49:52.000]
How the hell could that happen, by the way?

[00:49:52.020 --> 00:49:52.980]
How long was that going on?

[00:49:53.100 --> 00:49:53.480]
Things happen.

[00:49:53.580 --> 00:49:53.800]
Who knows?

[00:49:55.360 --> 00:49:56.880]
I'm trying with my ballpoint pen.

[00:49:57.420 --> 00:49:58.240]
I mean, I pulled it up.

[00:49:58.340 --> 00:49:59.120]
And it wasn't down.

[00:49:59.360 --> 00:50:00.140]
It's not depressed.

[00:50:00.420 --> 00:50:02.220]
I'm depressed that it was screwing things up.

[00:50:02.860 --> 00:50:03.980]
But nobody ain't touching it.

[00:50:05.660 --> 00:50:06.920]
And poor Fixit comes in.

[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:08.060]
Oh, geez, your dub.

[00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:11.100]
I've got my finger on it, but it ain't the dump button, sweetheart.

[00:50:11.460 --> 00:50:11.920]
So get lost.

[00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:13.900]
I know you're still not invited to come up here.

[00:50:14.020 --> 00:50:14.480]
Good going.

[00:50:15.540 --> 00:50:17.380]
1107, we got the Marlon pregame show.

[00:50:17.580 --> 00:50:19.060]
And I'm looking at that rain on the radar again.

[00:50:19.180 --> 00:50:20.380]
And it's doing just a wonderful thing.

[00:50:20.440 --> 00:50:22.900]
It's going to bypass the stadium because a trillion people

[00:50:22.900 --> 00:50:23.980]
want that ballgame today.

[00:50:24.300 --> 00:50:24.620]
When you think?

[00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:25.800]
I do.

[00:50:25.880 --> 00:50:27.500]
And I know three of them want that.

[00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:27.840]
Bad.

[00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:28.280]
Yes.

[00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:30.820]
And you're listening to him right now.

[00:50:31.220 --> 00:50:32.260]
Time all the time.

[00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:35.160]
Absolutely.

[00:50:37.060 --> 00:50:39.700]
It's been worthwhile to see that your ratings are dying.

[00:50:39.700 --> 00:50:40.140]
And how?

[00:50:41.340 --> 00:50:44.540]
Well, I don't want to show you what a big ass hit I was to your hand.

[00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:44.840]
How?

[00:50:45.560 --> 00:50:48.660]
You know, you can fight somebody good enough to fill my baggy pants.

[00:50:49.620 --> 00:50:50.540]
It ain't easy.

[00:50:54.540 --> 00:50:55.340]
Very no chance.

[00:50:55.480 --> 00:50:55.760]
I love it.

[00:50:55.860 --> 00:51:00.880]
Be coming back outside of considering a lucrative and come direct.

[00:51:02.520 --> 00:51:05.080]
If you want to know what it'll save you from shutting that transmitted

[00:51:05.080 --> 00:51:05.660]
the ground.

[00:51:06.260 --> 00:51:07.640]
Why that season?

[00:51:09.460 --> 00:51:10.860]
It's true.

[00:51:11.720 --> 00:51:13.400]
Oh, you need a smile.

[00:51:16.420 --> 00:51:18.160]
Oh, you need a smile.

[00:51:21.020 --> 00:51:23.020]
Oh, you need a smile.

[00:51:23.540 --> 00:51:24.100]
It's a blow.

[00:51:25.380 --> 00:51:27.240]
I'm going to give you a kiss.

[00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:30.500]
I'll give you a round of three shots.

[00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:31.820]
So we got you today.

[00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:36.200]
Is that my ratings that bottomed out in this case?

[00:51:36.980 --> 00:51:38.980]
Which radio have you been calling to?

[00:51:39.100 --> 00:51:41.000]
The biggest of all wars.

[00:51:41.340 --> 00:51:43.800]
And we did.

[00:51:45.740 --> 00:51:47.820]
Oh, you need a smile.

[00:51:48.660 --> 00:51:52.360]
Oh, you need a smile.

[00:51:53.540 --> 00:51:54.840]
Oh, you need a smile.

[00:51:55.080 --> 00:51:56.860]
Oh, you need a smile.

[00:51:56.860 --> 00:52:02.500]
Oh, you need a smile.

[00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:03.360]
Oh, you need a smile.

[00:52:03.360 --> 00:52:03.360]

[00:52:03.360 --> 00:52:03.360]

[00:52:03.360 --> 00:52:03.900]
You have a fight away.

[00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:07.060]
Come on.

[00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:10.100]
You're going to go fire me.

[00:52:11.640 --> 00:52:13.640]
1113-2560, 2017.

[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:21.500]
And you'll notice, in that Tom Jicke blog story about the changes

[00:52:21.500 --> 00:52:24.940]
is they're coming on this station and across the street and down the road and up the river.

[00:52:25.960 --> 00:52:27.700]
You know who was conspicuously absent?

[00:52:28.140 --> 00:52:31.880]
Because Tom named us about every sports talk person including a few dead people.

[00:52:31.980 --> 00:52:32.840]
But you know who was not on the list?

[00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:33.860]
Dr. Dr. Dr. Right.

[00:52:34.180 --> 00:52:34.280]
Hmm.

[00:52:34.920 --> 00:52:35.160]
Why not?

[00:52:35.260 --> 00:52:38.940]
Either here or across the street or down the road or up your ass.

[00:52:39.240 --> 00:52:39.480]
Why not?

[00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:43.360]
I guess there ain't no interest as what it might be because it's a good thing.

[00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:44.120]
Yeah that might be it.

[00:52:45.220 --> 00:52:46.360]
805 votes on the pool.

[00:52:46.540 --> 00:52:47.880]
We're shooting for whatever we get.

[00:52:48.060 --> 00:52:48.140]
You know?

[00:52:48.280 --> 00:52:50.580]
And I think we, how many certificates we have left for the river house?

[00:52:50.580 --> 00:52:51.580]
That's not third man.

[00:52:51.840 --> 00:52:52.500]
Last time I checked.

[00:52:53.120 --> 00:52:53.380]
Correct.

[00:52:53.900 --> 00:52:54.740]
I think that's a good deal.

[00:52:54.740 --> 00:52:55.220]
I like that.

[00:52:55.300 --> 00:52:55.840]
It was a great idea.

[00:52:55.960 --> 00:52:56.600]
Nice going, Duff.

[00:52:57.180 --> 00:52:57.500]
Yes.

[00:52:58.080 --> 00:53:01.380]
It's a good deal for all those things out there to save some money and do, uh, promote some

[00:53:01.380 --> 00:53:03.020]
really good restaurants and all these things.

[00:53:03.020 --> 00:53:03.700]
Get some food in here.

[00:53:03.800 --> 00:53:04.480]
It's win-win.

[00:53:04.820 --> 00:53:06.140]
We got food near for you guys.

[00:53:06.140 --> 00:53:07.120]
So what's not to like?

[00:53:07.220 --> 00:53:08.940]
Of course, like I said, I can't eat anything anymore.

[00:53:09.560 --> 00:53:10.420]
We got 30 left.

[00:53:10.540 --> 00:53:11.640]
I just checked the beginning.

[00:53:11.640 --> 00:53:12.480]
I'm eating your portion.

[00:53:13.540 --> 00:53:14.620]
Yeah, I bet you are.

[00:53:14.980 --> 00:53:16.300]
You're going to be puking your guts out.

[00:53:16.380 --> 00:53:17.740]
The food I'm sure is great but nevertheless.

[00:53:18.260 --> 00:53:18.380]
Hmm.

[00:53:18.380 --> 00:53:19.260]
I'm not going to go crazy.

[00:53:19.360 --> 00:53:19.960]
I'm going to punish you.

[00:53:20.060 --> 00:53:21.760]
Especially for that crap you said about leisure.

[00:53:22.180 --> 00:53:23.400]
I tunes and what was the other one?

[00:53:23.460 --> 00:53:24.000]
They're the best.

[00:53:24.520 --> 00:53:25.040]
And lime wire.

[00:53:25.500 --> 00:53:25.820]
Mm-hmm.

[00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:26.840]
It's all good.

[00:53:27.580 --> 00:53:28.140]
Guess who died.

[00:53:28.380 --> 00:53:29.240]
Not that anybody cared for.

[00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:29.880]
There's clayboard.

[00:53:30.540 --> 00:53:31.340]
Yeah, you knew that.

[00:53:32.240 --> 00:53:33.800]
Are we supposed to care about that bitch?

[00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:34.280]

You know, what's the way things are in this business right now

[00:56:21.160 --> 00:56:22.620]
may not be such a bad idea?

floor, the student of the federal government could get involved.

[00:56:36.680 --> 00:56:40.080]
I know it's just, it's the South Florida way, everything is shared aивают意.

[00:56:41.180 --> 00:56:45.220]
The tribe is argued it's entitled under federal law to have vaguer style slots, also known

[00:56:45.220 --> 00:56:50.160]
as class 3 slots, real slot machines, and it's 7 casinos after voters allow them at

Broward County's 4-per-mutuals, which you're not doing so great by the way, especially

Gulf Stream, is really suck and win.

[00:56:56.460 --> 00:57:00.460]
The Seminoles currently have class 2 slot machines, which are generally viewed as less

[00:57:00.460 --> 00:57:05.060]
lucrative for casinos and certainly less enjoyable for players because it's a bingo 18

[00:57:05.060 --> 00:57:06.000]
under the jean.

[00:57:06.280 --> 00:57:07.640]
I don't even know how that works.

[00:57:08.620 --> 00:57:12.920]
In a June 22nd letter to Christian, Tyrion Secretary, Dirk Kempthorne wrote, he's

[00:57:12.920 --> 00:57:15.960]
been encouraged by the commitment exhibited by both parties to reach a resolution that

[00:57:15.960 --> 00:57:18.060]
would allow the tribe to engage in class 3 gaming.

[00:57:18.420 --> 00:57:21.180]
And if that happens, you know what's going to happen to the parametrials, don't you?

[00:57:21.260 --> 00:57:21.940]
You know what they're going to be saying?

[00:57:22.080 --> 00:57:23.180]
I'm doing it over here.

[00:57:23.680 --> 00:57:27.820]
Kempthorne wrote that, though if Christian Seminoles do not reach an agreement on all our

[00:57:27.820 --> 00:57:31.380]
most of the outstanding issues within the next 60 days, I'll review my options at that

[00:57:31.380 --> 00:57:31.980]
time, as well.

[00:57:32.200 --> 00:57:33.600]
He's starting to like butch up a little bit.

[00:57:34.860 --> 00:57:38.120]
At stake, his millions of dollars of a gaming agreement has reached the stake to get

[00:57:38.120 --> 00:57:39.120]
a cut of the slots revenue.

[00:57:39.280 --> 00:57:40.080]
Well, it's about time.

[00:57:40.340 --> 00:57:43.740]
It's about time we got something out of those engines besides the obtained cancer sticks.

[00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:48.820]
The tribes operate the Seminoles Hard Rock Coachella Casino Complexes near Hollywood and

[00:57:48.820 --> 00:57:53.680]
Tampa, as well as Casinos in or near Hollywood, Coconut Creek, Brighton, Immaculate and Big

[00:57:53.680 --> 00:57:54.080]
Cypress.

[00:57:54.380 --> 00:57:55.820]
I never heard of Brighton Florida, did you?

[00:57:56.600 --> 00:57:56.860]
No.

[00:57:57.320 --> 00:58:00.660]
I mean, I grew up in Brighton, New York near Rochester.

[00:58:00.660 --> 00:58:03.260]
I never heard of Brighton Florida.

[00:58:03.420 --> 00:58:05.740]
This day, see if we're in something on this year or every day and day.

[00:58:07.180 --> 00:58:10.860]
The Federal Interior Department previously said in November 2006 deadline for the state

[00:58:10.860 --> 00:58:14.680]
and tribal negotiated gaming agreement, or else the federal government would establish

[00:58:14.680 --> 00:58:17.080]
guidelines allowing the Seminoles to have the biggest out slots.

[00:58:17.460 --> 00:58:20.380]
If the federal government granted the tribe plans to restlots the state would not get

[00:58:20.380 --> 00:58:21.380]
any cut of the slots revenue.

[00:58:22.280 --> 00:58:25.200]
But the Interior Department didn't follow through on the deadline, prompting the tribe to

[00:58:25.200 --> 00:58:28.780]
file a federal lawsuit to force Kempthorne to issue regulations allowing them to have the

[00:58:28.780 --> 00:58:30.760]
slots that lawsuit is still pending.

[00:58:32.540 --> 00:58:35.940]
Once they get it, what the permutials are going to have to look really bad.

[00:58:36.140 --> 00:58:37.380]
The whole thing was a bad deal.

[00:58:37.560 --> 00:58:39.520]
The way it legislates, you didn't, the permutials get screwed.

[00:58:39.680 --> 00:58:40.860]
But that's why everything works in Florida.

[00:58:41.220 --> 00:58:41.840]
Half-assed.

[00:58:42.460 --> 00:58:45.240]
If you could see the amount of money, I'm always talking about wood buying Wednesday and

[00:58:45.240 --> 00:58:46.300]
wood buying this and wood buying that.

[00:58:46.480 --> 00:58:49.180]
But if you could see the amount of money that, of course, through that joint, like on an

[00:58:49.180 --> 00:58:53.040]
average day, you would just, you would pee in your pants or maybe do something even worse,

[00:58:53.240 --> 00:58:53.400]
you know.

[00:58:54.440 --> 00:58:58.760]
Speaking of me, you think I'd have checked that QAM.com one more time.

[00:58:58.760 --> 00:58:59.680]
If you must.

[00:58:59.780 --> 00:59:00.160]
One more.

[00:59:00.400 --> 00:59:01.100]
It doesn't matter.

[00:59:01.280 --> 00:59:02.280]
I'm getting out of here anyway.

[00:59:02.500 --> 00:59:03.380]
So, 18.

[00:59:04.800 --> 00:59:06.060]
We got only 18 left.

[00:59:06.160 --> 00:59:08.720]
That means we sold 82 in about an hour.

[00:59:09.140 --> 00:59:10.020]
That's pretty good math there.

[00:59:10.940 --> 00:59:12.640]
That's a nice job, if you asked me.

[00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:13.280]
Nice job, Neil.

[00:59:13.440 --> 00:59:13.820]
Thank you.

[00:59:14.760 --> 00:59:15.400]
Excellent job.

[00:59:15.620 --> 00:59:16.320]
Thank you very much.

[00:59:17.440 --> 00:59:19.180]
What's wrong with you, yourself, a little pet on the back?

[00:59:19.280 --> 00:59:21.300]
Especially if you got, like, you know, arthritis stuff like that.

[00:59:21.340 --> 00:59:21.980]
It's a good exercise.

[00:59:22.960 --> 00:59:25.140]
Because in this town, who else is going to give you a pet on the back?

[00:59:25.240 --> 00:59:26.840]
Who's going to say, well, that was really great.

[00:59:26.840 --> 00:59:29.720]
You know, maybe Duff is going to come running and say, boy, you're doing a hell of a job

[00:59:29.720 --> 00:59:30.660]
with that thing today, Neil.

[00:59:30.720 --> 00:59:31.020]
And why not?

[00:59:31.500 --> 00:59:31.740]
Okay.

[00:59:32.340 --> 00:59:34.280]
If you're a legendary, you move crap.

[00:59:34.440 --> 00:59:34.860]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:59:34.960 --> 00:59:35.580]
And this isn't crap.

[00:59:35.720 --> 00:59:36.320]
This is a good deal.

[00:59:38.120 --> 00:59:42.100]
Every Thursday, we feature a business of the week at noon and we started early today

[00:59:42.100 --> 00:59:43.140]
because they have a short show.

[00:59:43.980 --> 00:59:45.660]
We give ourselves kind of a handicraft.

[00:59:46.540 --> 00:59:50.600]
Every Thursday, we open up the online store on wqm.com for whatever our business is

[00:59:50.600 --> 00:59:51.120]
that week.

[00:59:51.320 --> 00:59:54.640]
And they have to act fast because, like we told you, there's only limited number of gift

[00:59:54.640 --> 00:59:55.460]
certificates every week.

[00:59:55.520 --> 00:59:56.440]
Once they're gone, that's it.

[00:59:56.440 --> 00:59:57.640]
They'll be crying on Monday.

[00:59:57.780 --> 00:59:58.100]
Oh, geez.

[00:59:58.260 --> 00:59:59.760]
I want to go to the Rubber House for a half price.

[00:59:59.960 --> 01:00:01.420]
Well, you can do it if you get on there right now.

[01:00:01.500 --> 01:00:01.740]
What do we got?

[01:00:01.820 --> 01:00:02.260]
18 left?

[01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:05.160]
I sound like a freaking pitchman right now.

[01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:06.560]
Well, now what we're supposed to be is a patent.

[01:00:06.900 --> 01:00:07.480]
That's all we are.

[01:00:07.740 --> 01:00:08.280]
Who you kidding?

[01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:10.700]
No, I think the word you're looking for is whore.

[01:00:11.220 --> 01:00:13.940]
I said, I'm the only one in this business who ever admitted on the year where a bunch

[01:00:13.940 --> 01:00:15.220]
of paid whores.

[01:00:15.300 --> 01:00:16.900]
But in my case, a highly paid whore.

[01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:17.900]
So what's wrong with that?

[01:00:18.820 --> 01:00:19.040]
Nothing.

[01:00:19.180 --> 01:00:20.960]
That's even Xavier O'Holm to the...

[01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:24.980]
Oh, I told you that thing where Al Goldstein brought her to that blunch of that Thai

[01:00:24.980 --> 01:00:26.240]
restaurant in Amsterdam.

[01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:29.040]
I guess it was a Chinese restaurant.

[01:00:29.420 --> 01:00:32.640]
Well, anyway, whatever the hell it was, they closed the place down.

[01:00:32.740 --> 01:00:35.120]
He paid for them to close the place down for the entire day.

[01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:41.120]
And just we had a private lunch for Al and 50 of his best...

[01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:42.280]
I'm a fan, as if it was you.

[01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:44.260]
Poor Al.

[01:00:44.420 --> 01:00:45.540]
That was back when he had money.

[01:00:45.700 --> 01:00:49.640]
Back before the government decided to destroy him because he was a pornographer, just

[01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:50.220]
like Larry Flynn.

[01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:50.680]
Hey, Larry.

[01:00:51.020 --> 01:00:51.380]
Oh, geez.

[01:00:53.020 --> 01:00:54.880]
America's not big on things like that.

[01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:58.220]
America wants to like everybody toe the line, you know, toe that line.

[01:00:58.380 --> 01:01:00.140]
Except for Clarence Token Thomas, he's toeing it.

[01:01:01.540 --> 01:01:02.620]
820 votes on the pool.

[01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:03.640]
We're going to be doing OK.

[01:01:03.780 --> 01:01:04.960]
Well, that's pretty impressive, you know.

[01:01:05.020 --> 01:01:06.780]
And we apologize for that ballgame coming up.

[01:01:07.260 --> 01:01:08.080]
What are you going to do?

[01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:10.580]
What can you do?

[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.600]
Baby, only in Miami.

[01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:18.040]
When you go to Mendebroke in Hard Drive, these celebrity exes will help this woman say

[01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:19.460]
those three magic words.

[01:01:19.460 --> 01:01:21.220]
You little bastard.

[01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:23.280]
You son of a bitch.

[01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:24.760]
You're freaking crazy.

[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.280]
You're a friggin' idiot.

[01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:27.680]
That's so sick.

[01:01:28.140 --> 01:01:29.420]
I don't need this crap.

[01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:30.240]
We go.

[01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:31.360]
So go to Jacket.

[01:01:31.700 --> 01:01:33.100]
You are a freak.

[01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:34.240]
Stop.

[01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:35.320]
That's why.

[01:01:35.580 --> 01:01:36.520]
The ex-foyle is flat.

[01:01:36.740 --> 01:01:37.440]
Only on easy.

[01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:41.540]
OK, we've got the ball on free game show coming up in just a couple of minutes.

[01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:42.760]
And we're all sold out.

[01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:44.180]
Guess we're a river-hasted all gone.

[01:01:46.940 --> 01:01:48.380]
In other words, you know how many are left?

[01:01:49.220 --> 01:01:50.840]
In other words, oh, no, man.

[01:01:51.100 --> 01:01:51.520]
They're all gone.

[01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:53.520]
Great job, Neil.

[01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:53.940]
Thank you.

[01:01:53.940 --> 01:01:56.300]
All the world's nice going there.

[01:01:56.560 --> 01:01:58.360]
Never get courtesy of the on after the ballgame.

[01:01:58.540 --> 01:02:00.600]
Humber from 4 to 7 was NBA draft preview.

[01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:02.060]
And then after that, well.

[01:02:22.340 --> 01:02:25.960]
And then after that, well.

[01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:29.540]
And then after that, well.

[01:02:29.540 --> 01:02:29.920]
And then after that, well.

[01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:29.920]

[01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:29.920]

[01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:29.920]

[01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:29.920]

[01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:29.920]

[01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:30.240]
And then after that, well.

[01:02:30.260 --> 01:02:30.440]
And then after that, well.

[01:02:31.260 --> 01:02:32.020]
And then after that, well.

[01:02:32.020 --> 01:02:32.020]

[01:02:32.020 --> 01:02:32.020]

[01:02:32.020 --> 01:02:32.020]

[01:02:32.020 --> 01:02:32.040]
And then after that, well.

[01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:48.120]
And then after that, well.

[01:02:50.340 --> 01:02:53.000]
And then after that, well.

[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:53.000]

[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:53.000]

[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:53.000]

[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:53.000]

[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:53.000]

[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:53.000]

[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:53.000]

[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:53.300]
And then after that, well.

[01:02:53.300 --> 01:02:53.560]
And then after that, well.

[01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:54.840]
And then after that, well.

[01:02:54.840 --> 01:02:59.800]
And then after that, well.

[01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:02.020]
And then after that, well.

[01:03:02.020 --> 01:03:17.100]
And then after that, well.

[01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:48.880]
And then after that, well.
