[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.860]
We are the Banana Republic, baby. Only in Miami.

[00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.840]
Won't tell your story.

[00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:08.840]
I thought of who none knows.

[00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.840]
Shin is that the prettiest?

[00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:14.500]
And is that the smile?

[00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.080]
Oh, two throats, nine, fifty-six.

[00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.160]
You could say they died alive!

[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.780]
Rosie, big fat lesbian loud-roasting.

[00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:29.220]
The attacks and the sentient pure Christian illness of African women.

[00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.100]
The disease is all disgusting.

[00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.480]
Both inside and out, you take a look at her, she's a slob.

[00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.680]
She talks like a truck driver.

[00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:36.800]
He's mad again!

[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.940]
Rosie's the loser. You know us and I know us.

[00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.300]
Oh, not a woman!

[00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:47.460]
Oh, not a woman!

[00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.240]
Oh, not a woman!

[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.480]
Oh, not a woman!

[00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.060]
Then they kicked me out for this, and I had no talent.

[00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.500]
I have no vengeance towards the company.

[00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.060]
I'm simply happy about the fact that it is finally over.

[00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.520]
I'd like to know what's in perfected clearing.

[00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:06.640]
Rosie, enough already.

[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.580]
She'll fail because ultimately she's all about failure.

[00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.680]
I'm a baby, I'm a baby, and you!

[00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:15.760]
Let's be an ormidwester.

[00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.940]
All right, team Reveal!

[00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.120]
This is the kind of thing a girl does that she's very lovely.

[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.940]
Or a lesbian.

[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.880]
It's 10-0-2 at 5-60 WQM, Happy Wednesday, June 13, old bean.

[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.960]
Wow, tomorrow's vacation day starts.

[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:31.460]
So, I'm going to fly.

[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.180]
George will be on the one talking about David Chase.

[00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.740]
Oh, dear, I...

[00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.980]
And ripping the hell out of that last episode of the soprano.

[00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.720]
Right, so what happened? Nothing in general.

[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.160]
Nothing, yeah, right. Nothing happened.

[00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.200]
What's to talk about?

[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.680]
Oh, I'm so glad.

[00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.580]
You know, sometimes in life you make the right decision.

[00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:48.020]
That's right.

[00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.420]
You've got to be doing a joys here any minute.

[00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:49.880]
I totally agree with you.

[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:50.880]
I know you warned me.

[00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.820]
About 20-10, I said to George Ancriss, I said,

[00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.540]
Nature just didn't work out well for me this morning.

[00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.320]
And I have a feeling the timing is going to be like, I don't know.

[00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:00.740]
And that'll give you plenty of time.

[00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:01.920]
I'll quit not that much time.

[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.540]
You know how freaking this in life can be in it.

[00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.940]
That's right.

[00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.000]
But another few seconds to bitch about David Chase

[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.560]
in the last episode of the soprano.

[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:10.860]
Well, I'll just save it for Friday.

[00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.940]
We got much more important face to Friday today.

[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.060]
We got somebody who died.

[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.420]
Somebody very important celebrity.

[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.660]
But I think before that I may have to go running the other room.

[00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.120]
This is bad timing.

[00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:20.280]
Yeah, it is.

[00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.360]
Wait for the break for Christ's sake.

[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.480]
Where's your professionalism?

[00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:25.700]
In my...

[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.300]
That's what I got of your riddle.

[00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:29.560]
Professionalism on this radio station.

[00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.180]
That's right.

[00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:32.900]
He's bringing out the great immaterial already folks.

[00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:33.340]
For God's sake.

[00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.820]
Where I was.

[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.740]
Professionalism on my fat ass.

[00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.400]
Wow.

[00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.000]
Mr. Wizard is dead.

[00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.740]
Oh no.

[00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.940]
Oh my God.

[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.300]
Meet Mr. Wizard.

[00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.740]
Hey, Billy, you want to see how friction works?

[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.480]
Oh, that's bad.

[00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:47.460]
That was Mr. Wizard.

[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.280]
That was Mr. Rogers, I think.

[00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:50.380]
Yeah.

[00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:51.620]
He's long since dead.

[00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:52.620]
I think he was...

[00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.920]
I don't know.

[00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.580]
I just always felt he was a pervert.

[00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.840]
He's...

[00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:56.700]
He's scared me out.

[00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.120]
He kind of creeped me out.

[00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:58.380]
Yeah.

[00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.920]
I mean, that's the same thing wrong with being a pervert, unless of course you've denied.

[00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.080]
Unless of course you're doing a show for little kids, you know.

[00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.720]
Like, you know, playways, P house.

[00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:12.080]
Don Herbert, who was television's Mr. Wizard, introduced generations of young viewers to the

[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.000]
joys of science, died yesterday.

[00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.940]
He was 89.

[00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.180]
And if he asked me, that's plenty old enough.

[00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:18.420]
I take 89.

[00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.180]
I give me another 25 years of this crap.

[00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.440]
25 years is a long time.

[00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.640]
Isn't it?

[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:27.620]
Very long time.

[00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:28.440]
Well, all depending.

[00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:29.160]
Another 20 years.

[00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:30.020]
I mean, snap of the finger.

[00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.780]
That's the one message I keep giving all these young punks that I run into all my mind-space,

[00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:39.340]
people, my pizons out there, is that one of these days, you see, here's the way it works.

[00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.460]
And I've told you this before, but it's true.

[00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.800]
You start thinking about things that happen in your life, and you say, wow, that was like 10 years ago or whatever.

[00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:50.260]
And then all of a sudden, you're thinking about the same period of time.

[00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.200]
You said, that was like 30 years ago, you know.

[00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.360]
About 30, man.

[00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.040]
And then before you know what you're thinking about things that happened 50 years ago, and it's all over.

[00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:57.380]
Wow.

[00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:58.820]
Oh my God, I'm old.

[00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.720]
Woo!

[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.040]
There is the best advice I can give to all you young punks out there, don't ever get old.

[00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.300]
Pulled back the hands of time.

[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.320]
Just reach out, stretch out right now.

[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:10.800]
Do some of them stretch exercises.

[00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.380]
And reach right out and hold back the hands of father time.

[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.000]
Because he's a miserable bastard.

[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:22.520]
Herbert had bone cancer, died at a suburban Belcanian home in California, said his son-in-law, Tim Nicosi.

[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:24.980]
Yeah, bone cancer.

[00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:31.540]
He really taught kids how to... I guess he didn't have the scientific cure for that or whatever, you know.

[00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:32.080]
Right?

[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.860]
That's bad.

[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.680]
That's how the very insensitive and bad... By me, it's a point, he's supposed to be like a genius.

[00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.400]
Even Mr. Wizard couldn't cure it.

[00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.920]
He really taught kids how to use the thinking skills of a scientist, said former colleague Steve Jacobs.

[00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:52.500]
He worked with Herbert on the 1980 show that echoed the original 1950s Watch Mr. Wizard series, which became a fond baby boy.

[00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.980]
He was a former memory.

[00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:55.560]
Just like me, I'm a baby boomer and I remember it. Just like it was yesterday.

[00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:58.200]
We got our first TV set in 1952.

[00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.060]
It was that western house I kept telling you about.

[00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:09.080]
It was a beautiful piece of furniture and the screen folded down into the set, into the furniture.

[00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.620]
So it was like a cabinet.

[00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:16.260]
And then it had like a little handle and you lifted up and there would be the screen.

[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:17.500]
The picture...

[00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:18.020]
Right.

[00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:22.240]
Of course, back in those days you'd have to replace every now and then the picture too, which cost a normal lake.

[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.500]
Cost more than the TV set back then, I guess.

[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.120]
And the horizontal hold would keep...

[00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:33.480]
Remember the days, and can you remember back long enough when they used to have on TV's horizontal hold and vertical hold?

[00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:34.680]
Yeah, I'm sure.

[00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:36.420]
Even both you remember that.

[00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:37.380]
I guess it's not that long ago.

[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.780]
And of course now, if you would have said that to somebody, they said, what's that?

[00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.440]
Horizontal hold, the picture is rolling like CCR rolling, rolling, rolling, you know, like that.

[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.840]
Just one more reason I'd like to kill Pete Boulder, the CCR crap.

[00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:54.120]
Although once I started to play my own music, I'm saying at that point that show took off.

[00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:54.980]
I screw you, Pete.

[00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.220]
Screw you with your music list. You idiot. You're quizzling.

[00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:59.020]
You're fairy.

[00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:03.540]
Anyway, and watch Mr. Wizzid was produced from 1951 to 64.

[00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:09.560]
We see the P body award in 1954, or as they say Massachusetts and on that show.

[00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:13.900]
Rocky and Bullwinker, Bullwinker, Peebody.

[00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:17.700]
It's Peebody Mass, but it's the P body award in 1954.

[00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:24.420]
Herbert turned TV into an entertaining classroom on a simple workshop like said he demonstrated experiments using household items.

[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:27.120]
I mentioned Sally Fistler in some of the tools of her trade.

[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:27.560]
Oh, I do.

[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:29.040]
What?

[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:30.040]
No.

[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:32.320]
Yeah.

[00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:34.860]
Hey kids, you want to see what batteries could do for you?

[00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:35.400]
Wow.

[00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.660]
He modeled how to predict and measure and analyze.

[00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:43.580]
The show today might seem slow, but it was in depth and forced you to think along, Jacob said.

[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:45.540]
You were learning about the forces of nature.

[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:52.040]
Like Howard Beale said, the forces of nature, you know, that was an hour of Beale said that that was Ned Beatty.

[00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:53.420]
Remember that? You have messed with the...

[00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:54.740]
I'm not even mad at hell.

[00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:56.460]
I don't think I take this anymore.

[00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:56.840]
Oh!

[00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:04.620]
Herbert encouraged children to duplicate experiments at home, said, Jacob, so we counted serving as a behind the scenes science sidekick, Herbert.

[00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:08.200]
He measured on the 80s Mr. Wizard's World that aired on the Nickelodeon channel.

[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:12.700]
See, it's a good thing this crosses all generations because he was on everywhere.

[00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:16.940]
He was on NBC and he was on Nickelodeon and he was...

[00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:18.460]
He was well, we'll get to the Letterman thing.

[00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:24.820]
When Jacob's would reach for breakers and flasks, Herbert, where he might have made a sense, didn't require special tools.

[00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:29.480]
You could use a mayonnaise jar for that, Jacob's recalled things, tried it by Herbert.

[00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:34.040]
He tried to bust the image of scientists and that science wasn't just for special people in places.

[00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:35.960]
He used a mayonnaise jar for that.

[00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:40.880]
Of course, then he chose some amazing experiments where you'd empty out the mayonnaise and where you'd hide it.

[00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:44.620]
Heard that, Herbert's place in TV history was acknowledged by later stars.

[00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:47.300]
Here's something I didn't know. I bet you didn't either.

[00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:53.680]
When late night, when David Letterman debuted in 1982, Herbert was among the guests on the very first night.

[00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:54.620]
How do you like that?

[00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:58.440]
Mr. Wizard was again, it's a miracle Letterman is still on now as a result of that.

[00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:03.940]
When you talk about desperate, that's worse than even Drew Rosenstein house crants of Burge.

[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:13.380]
Born in Wacomium, Minnesota, Herbert was a 1940 graduate of LaCrosse Day Teachers College and served as US Army Air Corps pilot during WW2.

[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:18.360]
He worked as an actor, model and radio writer before starting Wax-Mr. Wizard in Chicago on NBC.

[00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:27.820]
The show moved to New York after several years. He survived by six kids and stepchildren and by his second wife, Norma, and his son-in-law, Private Funeralist Plan for Mr. Wizard.

[00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:29.960]
Let's go there and have an experiment on his grave.

[00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:32.240]
What kind of an experiment?

[00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:35.920]
I don't know, maybe like P on the grave and see if he comes back to life and like watering a plant.

[00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:41.760]
You know, you never know what Mr. Wizard, he always had some magic thing he'd pull out of his pants out of his hat.

[00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:48.460]
So, Don Herbert said, I never really thought about him for many years now and would have thought he croaked a long time ago.

[00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:55.440]
He was 89. I mean 89 isn't that all. I bet you we got people right now listening to him or at least 89, maybe 99.

[00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:58.640]
Maybe? Probably not.

[00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:02.760]
All the old people hate me like poison and of course that's really sad because now I'm one of them.

[00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:06.300]
That used to be my audience.

[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.060]
Boy, I sure ran the gamut in this time. I'll tell you. The gamut. I ran it.

[00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:14.260]
Oh, I think I'm on a way out. See ya.

[00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:20.300]
I ran the gamut from talking to ancient Farts on WKAT in 1976 and 1977.

[00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:25.340]
The median age you are listening audience on that station was death plus 10. Make no mistake about it.

[00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:28.160]
We didn't have anybody listening under the age of 100.

[00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:35.840]
And I remember one night, what a fool I was. I switched with Irv Shinler. Irv used to do like Alvin and him and Shovey Speller.

[00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:39.080]
He used to be on every other night from like 9 to midnight and I was doing middays.

[00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:44.400]
And I said to Irv, how do you like to switch one day? You go on the daytime and talk to my audience and I'll go on it night.

[00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:51.200]
And I was talking education and I thought, well, being on it and they're on the daytime, I can't talk about education because the school teachers

[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:54.320]
for example won't call in because they're in school. They're teaching, you know.

[00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:58.560]
So I'll go on a night and talk to the school teachers about education and about Yadda.

[00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:03.600]
And you think I'll get a school teacher to call? Of course not. They won't listen to WKAT. Right.

[00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:08.060]
There were no school teachers a hundred years old. Although I had a couple of knives and going to school.

[00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:11.140]
I had good teachers. That's why I turned out to be such a genius.

[00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:18.600]
Here's the poor result. And of course all the female teachers except one or two were old dikes.

[00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:23.200]
We used to call them old maids because back in those days being lesbian wasn't what it is nowadays.

[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:29.480]
In addition to which even nowadays old lesbians like that, old wrinkled up, prune like lesbians, that isn't what's in, you know.

[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:35.140]
Being a hot young lesbian, that's what all the straight guys want. They want to be in the middle, you know. They want to be like the...

[00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:38.800]
Like the meat in the sandwich.

[00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:43.940]
I was thinking more like the Oreo cookies, you know. I don't want to use something as grotesque as meat.

[00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:47.340]
Okay, meat. You and your meat. That's right.

[00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:51.840]
1459 votes on speaking of that. The ties right in with that, the meat.

[00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:56.680]
1459 yesterday is full. Can you have a relationship with a girl if she had sex with you on the first date?

[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.720]
I just... I don't even understand the question.

[00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:08.700]
Not not being a header or myself and just fighting all this complicated crap. You know, with me, if it looks good and it's willing, you have a good time.

[00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:12.920]
You know what I'm saying, no matter what it might be, as long as it's of legal age and is willing.

[00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:22.020]
Yes, what's wrong with that? A thousand eighty-seven and most of these people agree. 74.5%. Some goofballs like Josh Corpus who make up crap, you know.

[00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:28.380]
Oh no, I wouldn't want to take her home to mom and I wouldn't want her to be the father of my children, the mother, whatever. The mother of the law of my children.

[00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:34.620]
74.5% said, sure, what's wrong with that? Hell yeah, she'd be a change of pace when I blow up dial another hundred and thirty-eight.

[00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:43.720]
So you add those two together, it's like 84%. I mean, it's no drainer. No, that makes it worse slut. Here's the crap that I find just 130.

[00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:53.420]
8.9%. Now maybe she didn't intend on having sex on the first day, but she was so swept away by your sexuality and your romantic age.

[00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:58.400]
Exactly, there you go. Huh? I mean, you're trying to anyway, so what? You're going to get mad because you succeed?

[00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:03.140]
Right, that's just to be stupid, you know. I'm a girl who likes sex on the first day, 53.

[00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:09.680]
Where are they? I'm a girl who won't date a guy who wants sex on the first day, 51. Well, they're home is where they are all alone.

[00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:16.080]
7% were ladies on this floor, which either, I don't know what that means. Pretty good for us, when you think? Sure, I'll take that.

[00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:21.220]
Pretty impressive. W-I-O-D-O-I hate that stage. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

[00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:27.100]
This is Rushwin Ball, serving of humanity, talks to a host, hemorrhoid, sufferer.

[00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:33.600]
Folks, it over 300 pounds. I know the agony of this kind of dilemma. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm here to tell you theirs help.

[00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:42.600]
With new Preparation Rush and my Rush to Excellence Suppositories, now you can end the pain and itching of hemorrhoidal tissue.

[00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:53.260]
Just for my picture on the box of suppositories, have the applicator tube, another fine product from OIV, the obesity in broadcasting network.

[00:12:53.260 --> 00:13:04.220]
The applicator was? Oh, 1017 at 560 WM, happy Wednesday, 2nd, mad dog at 2, power hour with mad dog in the Humper between 4 and 5, Humper solo between 5 and 630.

[00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:13.680]
They're going to bring in 6 tanks of oxygen to keep an uncle until 630. At 630, Marlins on deck, Marlins and the engines at 705 fell by over a game night, whatever it is with any K.

[00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:18.300]
Now what's the story? The Marlins win last night are loose. They won, they said, well, how do you like that?

[00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:25.020]
Against the engines, you might call the Florida Marlins a... But then again, does anybody really care?

[00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:32.800]
Now the reason I played the Rush Limbaugh thing and the WIWD, I hate that station like Poison and Boy do we ever? Don't we hate them like Poison?

[00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:37.560]
Yes. I'm not asking you, you never worked there. Well, I'm not going to tear it right now, sir.

[00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:42.040]
Oh, don't tell me little George went out for a pit stop already. I thought he already had Joyce this morning.

[00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:45.400]
I didn't know what they enveloped in his hand, so you know.

[00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:50.140]
Well, I'm back there. What does that mean? I guess my timing was off. Well, I stopped by the bathroom.

[00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:55.420]
What's that kind of thing with envelopes? Did you make a deposit? Yes. No matter if I did.

[00:13:55.900 --> 00:14:02.420]
You wanted to make a swipe and today a tea room, he made it up to the two deposits. Well, good for you. Well, when you can make in the big bucks that you're making.

[00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:07.560]
Anyway, I just played that Rush Limbaugh about preparation and the Rush thing.

[00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:13.300]
Howard made cancel deal with radio station because it is Rush Limbaugh. How do you like that? Wow.

[00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:24.660]
Rush Limbaugh has long been a thorn in the side of Liberals, right? Scott Wyman in the scum sentinel, but now because of him, some Democratic politicians don't even want to join with a local radio station to broadcast hurricane information.

[00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:28.540]
How do you like that? Is that a fly opener or what? Oh my god.

[00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:35.500]
Uh oh, former White House counsel Harry admirers this to be this a peening a whole bunch of people are in DC.

[00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:38.440]
They got a picture of the White House and see him as breakfast.

[00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:47.660]
In your level people inside the White House top is to president Bush and it is significant because I think there's something that Congress has written to do.

[00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:54.420]
They were saying that if these figures Harry, Myers, Sarah, Taylor and others didn't come before Congress voluntarily.

[00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:59.060]
They would use their subpoena power. Not good. Not time they would step just a little bit past it.

[00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:15.120]
Anyway, getting back to this very important story radio station WIOD AM610 where we used to work like crazy and did a hell of a job back in the day when it was a very popular station and had like all, you know, people in local people instead of opening up the pot and smoking it and just putting on some syndicated right wing crap.

[00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:20.700]
WIOD has been the official channel for emergency information from Robert County government for the past year.

[00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:31.500]
The County Commission, all Democrats, blocked it renewing the deal yesterday, unable to stomach the station also being home to Limbaugh's anxious right wing, propagandized pill popping talk show.

[00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:37.260]
Commissioner Stacey Ritter said she did not want to support the station as out of step with area politics.

[00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:39.120]
Well, support this one, Stacey, okay?

[00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:45.240]
We're political, at least from 10 to 2 anyway. The rest of the day they're just a bunch of right wing jocks sniffing idiots.

[00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:49.240]
Well, I'm sure that Hank is a liberal and an decay who else we got?

[00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:51.080]
Mandage.

[00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:55.560]
Well, why do you do such stupid things?

[00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:58.380]
Why is there say, is there, was there written on your birth certificate?

[00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:03.320]
Yes, your compelled to spirit a Christ compels you to open up your mouth and make stupid sounds with it?

[00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:13.800]
Ritter, a Democratic stalwart in the state legislature before being elected to County office cited talk shows hosted by Limbaugh and Sean Hannity and WIOD's partnership with Fox News.

[00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:15.160]
Oh, God.

[00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:19.140]
They have every right to speak but we don't have to do business with them, she said.

[00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:26.720]
Limbaugh's long-benefixed around WIOD but no County official raised an issue about him or the other shows when the deal was approved for the first time a year ago.

[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:35.240]
The deal with WIOD would ensure that news conferences are broadcast from start to finish live from the County Emergency Operations Center in plantation.

[00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:43.520]
Emergency managers became concerned during hurricanes in 2004 and 5 that radio and TV stations preempted their announcements in favor of news out of Miami.

[00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:48.360]
Oh, I see, in other words, it's supposed to be Broward.

[00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:53.060]
As opposed to Limbaugh who lives in Palm Beach couldn't be reached for comment.

[00:16:53.240 --> 00:17:03.940]
Ken Charles, WIOD's director of AM programming such as it is, said the station's talk show lineup has got no relationship with its news coverage and that the County should focus on the benefits of teaming with the station.

[00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:09.140]
It's a shame that people would let politics get in the way of saving lives in a hurricane, Charles said.

[00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:15.800]
The contract with WIOD was on the verge of being rejected when commissioners instead delayed a decision till next week.

[00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:18.780]
Oh, brother, now we meet now you because I'll be on vacation.

[00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:22.180]
You got something before to next week. Great. You better read all over this.

[00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:25.080]
Like stink on Joyce.

[00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:32.380]
They told their communications staff they want more information on why WIOD was recommended what their options are.

[00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:47.040]
Ritaz concerns were echoed by commissioners can keep a former president of the WIOD's gay Democratic Club, a gay Democratic Club, and Suzanne Gunsberger who served on the Votaling Board that we counted the 2000 presidential election.

[00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:54.380]
But Commissioner John Rothstrom, a one-time young Republican leader, related became a Democrat, said the County should not politicize emergency management.

[00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:56.540]
I hate to say it, but I think he's right.

[00:17:57.500 --> 00:18:03.200]
I mean, what's politics got to do with where, you know, if people can hear the station? We sure wouldn't want it on this station.

[00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:10.280]
Now with our great AM signal, although we are in stereo. What are we in? We're in HD or HD?

[00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:14.440]
Digital stereo, yeah. And there's like four people in the world that have a radio like that.

[00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:18.220]
And none of them live in South Florida, but none of them know. If they did, they'd hear it really great.

[00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:24.140]
If we're going to start censoring what people write in the paper or speak on the radio or television, that's a slippery slope rock.

[00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:27.900]
And then I said, this is necessary. It's something we need to do for emergency response.

[00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:33.540]
I don't see what the programming content has got to do because I underwent the same kind of crap, you know, the city of Hollywood.

[00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:34.100]
That is correct.

[00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:41.160]
Try to get me off the air in the city of Hollywood. They wanted to put up a big fence to block the signal from getting into, yeah, just stupid stuff.

[00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:45.660]
We needed anything with stupid old farts. Yeah, put up a big fence and we'll block the signal.

[00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:55.280]
Oh, a county task force that looked into the response to Will Melister finding a radio partner among its recommendations last year.

[00:18:56.260 --> 00:19:02.480]
Judy Sarver, the county's public communications director, said WFTO and WLRN also offered to take on the role.

[00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:11.220]
But that she had other emergency planners prefer WIERD because of its signal strength, numerous FM sister stations and moving this to give Broward top play.

[00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:16.500]
Well, there you go. Broward wants to be on top. Of course, date is a bottom. There's no doubt about that.

[00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:21.220]
Because if you live in date, you're going to, you already got in the screw. Make no mistake about that.

[00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:27.560]
Who the hell is in date beside Chris? And a few of our listeners out there, and you know, I understand a lot of you have been kept prisoner in date.

[00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:32.680]
We're sorry for it. We feel for it. We feel your pain. Did I do today's pull yet? No.

[00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:38.920]
And you know something that's not a good idea either, Chris, because you're going to need some real heavy assistance to get to 1000 votes today.

[00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:44.180]
Even though we got a full four hours today on Woodbine Wednesday, no ballgame. Well, we got a ballgame, a natural 630 at night.

[00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:51.140]
We couldn't be playing some last night's Marlon Victory though. That would be good. Since this station is very big on replaying play by play.

[00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:54.660]
Oh, brother. Here's the ball.

[00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:55.920]
It's the 7th.

[00:19:56.480 --> 00:20:00.380]
How big you're putting last night's game. It's kind of boring until the 7th. So you know, no.

[00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:03.780]
Well, that's okay. Aren't they all to baseball?

[00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:08.940]
662 votes is all we got. If we get to 1000 a day, boy, you're going to really have to pull up your fly.

[00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:13.320]
It's going to take quite an accomplishment. Who is Mola overpaid? That's the pull out.

[00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:19.320]
I don't know who sent this. It's not what a Charlie B's. And I looked at it and I thought, hey, that's pretty good pull right there.

[00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:27.900]
You see anything wrong with this pull? Not at all. Although I do take great umbrages to the extent that the 25 people said, I am the most overpaid.

[00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:29.800]
Well, you know what? Hubsan Dread.

[00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:43.160]
Big company CEO is most overpaid. 323 almost half the votes. We resent that bitterly while the poor sluppers that make the products like the people working on the assembly line and Detroit. They're making, you know, what?

[00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:51.320]
A mere 20, 30, 40 bucks an hour. And the big company CEOs are taking all millions, millions. Pro Jocks 178. That was my vote.

[00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:58.140]
Guys that put on a Jocks draft, most of whom are like inarticulate illiterate morons.

[00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:08.020]
178. That's it. I had a lot more than that. A lot more. Actors 47. Lawyers 40. Realtors 32. NEO25 overpaid.

[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:18.480]
31 and a half years, well 31 years plus of sitting over a lukewarm microphone and trying to entertain them use the South Florida, the hostile crowd, the angry crowd.

[00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:23.740]
25 people say I'm overpaid. You should live so long. It would sound like to me. It sounds like jealousy.

[00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:34.260]
When you say it sounds like the nasty, hateful jealousy. Stockbrokers 10 and Rockstar is only seven. Why is that? Why Rockstar has only seven votes?

[00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:36.120]
Because people think they deserve their money.

[00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:40.640]
Oh yeah, like Justin Tinkerbell. Now he deserves all that money.

[00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:45.820]
No, no. Rockstar on there. Like Bottle? Yeah.

[00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:52.500]
If you want me to continue here to make my point about all the money. No, how about name some ones that you do like?

[00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:57.240]
You have a how about your point? See that's not the point. I know. That isn't the point here.

[00:21:58.140 --> 00:22:01.340]
I mean the good ones deserve whatever they get. That's right. That's the good. There you go.

[00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:06.480]
But because, like you're always saying about because somebody's on television and everybody thinks they're a big superstar.

[00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:11.360]
I don't know. The same thing applies here. In addition to which it's all jealousy.

[00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:16.500]
I don't think we're going to build gates all that money. I just want my slice. That's all. Just give me my slice.

[00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:20.040]
Right. A pecan pie. Don't start with the food today. Oh.

[00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:27.340]
I can't afford to get sick again. No, I have recovered. No, I'm almost coherent today. It's good. So far it's good.

[00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:31.660]
What did he make? It was only business. I always liked him.

[00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:41.300]
Good brother. You've been talking already all day tonight.

[00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:46.060]
You've been talking about sports with he ain't what? That's right.

[00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:52.000]
Well, well, well, well. That's what he did down the night.

[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.040]
No. Oh.

[00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:55.460]
Probe the show.

[00:22:57.180 --> 00:22:59.120]
You know what I'm talking about?

[00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:00.320]
You know what I'm talking about?

[00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:04.020]
Oh, that's not it. I've been.

[00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:05.360]
Oh. Oh.

[00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:06.200]
Probe the show.

[00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:07.640]
Give it up.

[00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:08.180]
Show.

[00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:10.120]
Oh.

[00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:12.420]
Probe the show.

[00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:14.460]
Come on.

[00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:17.740]
I'll break you up.

[00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:18.320]
I'm sitting.

[00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:22.440]
Oh.

[00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:22.600]
Oh.

[00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:22.740]

[00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:23.160]
Oh, it's roll.

[00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:26.380]

[00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:28.160]
It's a radio.

[00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:32.860]
It's in the world.

[00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:34.720]
All the radio.

[00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:36.520]
That's what it's called.

[00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:43.540]
It's in the back.

[00:23:49.180 --> 00:23:50.320]
But he sure smelled it.

[00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:51.160]
Much too good, though.

[00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:54.200]
That Kashmir bouquet bath always just turned me off.

[00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:59.400]
Before we get to the crow in the story that you just somebody faxed to us, chicken act,

[00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:01.060]
vulca brine, evidently hide a lawyer.

[00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:01.360]
Good.

[00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:03.320]
So there are asked if you don't get the money by the end of the week.

[00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:05.100]
That's my suggestion.

[00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:09.560]
And his attorney has been talking to our corporate attorney, better known as Charts,

[00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:10.060]
that bitch.

[00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:14.100]
And come to find out from her, she's not the one that vetoed this bit.

[00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:16.900]
And they know it.

[00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:21.360]
So we're going to need to get the Shylock Holmes and Calabra went on this case and find out he done it.

[00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:25.220]
Like before, she probably never even heard the damn thing.

[00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:27.940]
But because these people are terrified of their own shadow,

[00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:30.140]
oh gee, corporate doesn't want you to play that.

[00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:31.700]
Well, and we blamed her for that.

[00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:32.780]
So you owe her an apology.

[00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:35.420]
I thought it was be easily that didn't like it.

[00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:37.320]
Is that what it was?

[00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:38.100]
I thought so.

[00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:39.780]
I thought that's what I heard from you or someone.

[00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:41.380]
You must hear it from somebody else.

[00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:42.260]
Corporate.

[00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:46.120]
Well, corporate can, you know, you usually assume since she makes almost all the decisions for corporate,

[00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:50.300]
including which hand to wipe their ass with, you would assume it was her.

[00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:54.740]
And generally speaking, you do well to assume it's her because she's, she's hateful anyway.

[00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:56.200]
But in this case, it was not her.

[00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:59.440]
Just a little something that, how come George isn't saying it?

[00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:00.320]
What do you want me to say?

[00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:00.980]
Well, I don't know.

[00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:02.660]
You're the one that told me all of this good something.

[00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:03.980]
Yeah, I'm going to touch with you.

[00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:05.640]
And I also said I can get the whole story today.

[00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:07.880]
And you're not going to get a chat today, Brian.

[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:08.480]
They just told me.

[00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:12.240]
But by the end of the week, who's day that just told you?

[00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:14.180]
Well, Clarence told me a little while ago.

[00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:18.740]
If he don't have that checked by the end of the week, man, the fur is going to fly.

[00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:19.660]
At whatever that means.

[00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:20.380]
I don't know what that means.

[00:25:21.340 --> 00:25:23.300]
We got 688 votes on the point.

[00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:24.660]
You just make threatening sounds.

[00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:25.840]
I get very nervous about that.

[00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:27.960]
Oh, no.

[00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:34.720]
Now, I think I think that she was very, and didn't you tell me that Joyce was very co-phased with the book as a terrain?

[00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:36.380]
Yes, that's the story I got.

[00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:37.160]
Very simple.

[00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:38.120]
Very concord, aesthetic.

[00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:40.580]
In fact, I think just pathetic would describe her really well.

[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.140]
Hey, Joyce, you're fair.

[00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:43.360]
Anyway, so that's the deal.

[00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:44.380]
He's going to get paid.

[00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:48.960]
And of course, ordinarily, unlike a real radio station, people would be wondering,

[00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:50.000]
well, why you tell us that?

[00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:52.120]
Well, it's part of the soap opera that is QAM.

[00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:54.280]
And then we're stuck in the middle of it.

[00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:55.180]
Now, getting back to the crow.

[00:25:57.060 --> 00:25:59.460]
And as the crow flies, this is from the scum's center.

[00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:00.740]
Today, no less.

[00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:04.960]
Back in Japan, 53-year-old Warren Cromarty is ready to wrestle.

[00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:06.620]
Question market says, yes.

[00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:08.100]
Wrestle.

[00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:09.100]
Absolutely.

[00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:11.140]
Always flamboyant on the field.

[00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:13.540]
Warren Cromarty has said to trade his bet for the mat.

[00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:16.720]
It says, the former self-footer radio personality.

[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:17.220]
Wow.

[00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:19.800]
Radio personality, my ass.

[00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:23.980]
And Montreal Expos Outfielder became a fan favorite in Japan as player manager.

[00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:29.280]
We'll step into the ring Sunday in a pro wrestling event called Hustle Aid.

[00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:31.120]
Is that what that says?

[00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:32.260]
This is a bad cow.

[00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:32.820]
That's what it says.

[00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:38.000]
As part of Tag Team match, he'll face an opponent who walks around with a sword in his mouth

[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.600]
and says he wants to hurt Cromarty.

[00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:40.420]
No.

[00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:41.740]
Sounds like more of that cry.

[00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:42.920]
Better watch that, Brandon.

[00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:43.740]
Thread up your alley.

[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:48.580]
I have to represent all baseball players, the 53-year-old Cromarty, said yesterday.

[00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:50.280]
I got a reputation here.

[00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:51.700]
I've got my fans in Japan.

[00:26:52.140 --> 00:26:54.700]
So I'm taking this very seriously and I've been training real hard.

[00:26:55.720 --> 00:27:01.620]
I told a long time wrestler, Tagore G. Singh, hopes to injure him, Cromarty hardly flinched.

[00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:04.540]
I'm going to take him out just like I double-played, he said.

[00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:10.040]
I'm going to go from first to third and take him out with a home run shop.

[00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:17.600]
When he played in Japan, Cromarty was involved in a brawler too.

[00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:19.500]
He said that that should prepare him for the weekend.

[00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:23.880]
The 63-year-old Singh was not amused by Cromarty's fore-rated and other sport.

[00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:27.460]
Pro Wrestling is a vicious game, a dangerous game, Singh said.

[00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:28.760]
He should stick to baseball.

[00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:32.040]
I'll teach him a lesson once and for all.

[00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:35.360]
I'll teach him to sing for his sufferers, not like that.

[00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:36.160]
5-6-7.

[00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:39.180]
Oh, 8-5-60.

[00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:45.480]
I think that dropping right there kind of sums him all up.

[00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:46.320]
Let me hear it again.

[00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:47.260]
5-6-7.

[00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:50.080]
Oh, 8-5-60.

[00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:50.880]
Oh, yeah.

[00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:54.980]
6-91 on your full course, you've got about as much chance to make in the thousands of days

[00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:58.420]
I do a finding a million dollars in my machine stuck on the floor would buy.

[00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:00.100]
I like my chances more than yours.

[00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:01.020]
You like your chances?

[00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:01.440]
Okay.

[00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:02.360]
We'll get a grand.

[00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:04.140]
I like my paycheck better than yours.

[00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:05.280]
Yeah, I do too.

[00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:05.880]
You want to switch?

[00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:06.740]
No.

[00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:08.040]
Do I want to switch?

[00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:09.460]
Was that another one of those kind of comments?

[00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:10.080]
Not now.

[00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:10.600]
Mm-hmm.

[00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:10.900]
Yeah.

[00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:11.700]
Yeah.

[00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:15.540]
Oh, and so speaking of Don Herbert.

[00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:17.080]
I don't think he is.

[00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:17.960]
What time is it?

[00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:18.000]
Oh, yeah.

[00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:20.140]
Oh, yeah.

[00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:22.860]
Oh, yeah.

[00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:27.840]
That's your start in 1951.

[00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:29.820]
Like I said, I used to go down the street.

[00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:34.120]
There was a little girl on the street and her mommy had a TV.

[00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:35.620]
So I guess daddy was dead or something.

[00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:36.720]
I don't know what the deal was.

[00:28:36.780 --> 00:28:40.000]
But anyway, they had a TV like about a year before we did.

[00:28:40.060 --> 00:28:41.780]
So in 1951, I would have been nine years old.

[00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:47.940]
And I'd go down there every afternoon and watch Howdy Doody and whatever else was a cookbook friend and I don't remember what time that was.

[00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:51.320]
So we don't have the theme song for Mr. Wiss.

[00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:53.060]
Was there a theme on the show that must have been?

[00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:55.960]
Wasn't there a theme for everything?

[00:28:57.320 --> 00:28:58.080]
I'm sure there was.

[00:28:58.200 --> 00:28:58.820]
I don't have it though.

[00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:00.060]
But I do have this.

[00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:02.320]
We were talking about this just the other day.

[00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:05.120]
And I will be true of Ernie Kovac.

[00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:14.340]
One of the great comic geniuses of all time, Ernie Kovac.

[00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:17.440]
I know Slippery Highway in New York, a car crash and he was dead.

[00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:18.640]
But I mean he was dead like that.

[00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:19.320]
Bingo, Bingo.

[00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:19.720]
Dead.

[00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:21.240]
Goes around.

[00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:27.780]
And there are other shows in the early 1952, the themes around here for old parts like me.

[00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:29.420]
Hello again.

[00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:30.960]
This is Jack Benny.

[00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:32.000]
Yep.

[00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:35.720]
We are going to explore the world of Golden Television.

[00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:40.360]
A We As Performer shared with you the creative best in our lives.

[00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:45.240]
You saw the performers in your own big ugly glass picture tube.

[00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:51.300]
But one of the reserved radio and television who were able to provide free entertainment of the highest caliber

[00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:54.480]
was the advertisers who paid the bills.

[00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:03.180]
From television city in Hollywood, the Jack Benny program,

[00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:08.140]
with his special guest Dan Daly, Kirk Douglas, Fred McMurray, Tony Martin and Dick Powell,

[00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:09.840]
resided by Lucky Strike.

[00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:21.520]
And last RFT baby, Lucky Strike means fine tobacco.

[00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:24.720]
Those were the days when you can advertise cigarettes on TV, faggots.

[00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:25.320]
Faggots.

[00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:27.120]
Winston Tasequid like a cigarette should.

[00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:29.260]
And the moral role man riding in on the big house.

[00:30:30.820 --> 00:30:33.360]
And Salem with the gillem and all that other stuff.

[00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:34.760]
And the new ports.

[00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:37.480]
I used to smoke new ports when I was in college because it was really gay.

[00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:40.680]
You think straight guys ever smoke new ports?

[00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:41.500]
I sure hope not.

[00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:42.360]
I don't know.

[00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:43.440]
Really bad free image.

[00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:46.480]
The good news is Chris has got 700 votes on his personal pool

[00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:49.180]
and only 28 people say I'm overpaid.

[00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:52.020]
And those 28 people, that's my response to you, okay?

[00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:54.480]
Jellice is a really bad trait.

[00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:56.240]
Were you drudge back at?

[00:30:56.860 --> 00:30:58.480]
Hello and welcome to a coronaphrase.

[00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:00.740]
Harris Hilton, now behind bars,

[00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:03.360]
it will be her home for the next three weeks.

[00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:05.680]
Harris, how was your first full day in prison?

[00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:07.440]
It's a lot of fun.

[00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:08.060]
Really?

[00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:08.880]
I love it.

[00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:09.320]
Really?

[00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:10.000]
A lot.

[00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:11.400]
What's so fun about it?

[00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:12.520]
Tuge and clothes, cages.

[00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:13.080]
Tages?

[00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:15.240]
It's a lot of fun where a playhouse wife.

[00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:19.760]
And I heard you were involved in some kind of three way lesbian thing.

[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:20.520]
Yes, it was.

[00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:21.300]
Last night.

[00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:21.660]
Oh.

[00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:23.240]
I can't wait to come out.

[00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:24.900]
I heard you made another sex tape.

[00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:26.640]
People keep asking about the sex tape.

[00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:27.620]
I'm really getting f*** off.

[00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:28.420]
It's really rude.

[00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:30.720]
One more person asked me, I'm going to get up and walk away.

[00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:33.080]
Actually, you can't get up and walk away.

[00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:35.140]
So tell us about your lesbian sex tape.

[00:31:35.140 --> 00:31:35.680]
That's all.

[00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:38.020]
Oh.

[00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:41.260]
1045 at 560 WQM, the pain is so great.

[00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:42.940]
We have 714, 714.

[00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:44.320]
That's the quailudes again, isn't it?

[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:45.680]
That's not lutes.

[00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:46.540]
You know, I never...

[00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:46.620]
You know, I never...

[00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:47.040]
...siviuses.

[00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:48.680]
What I get some, I'll let you know.

[00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:49.180]
Oh.

[00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:52.360]
I'm pretty sure one of them druggy people warned me about that.

[00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:53.280]
That's on the ludes, man.

[00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:54.600]
You better know your drugs, mister.

[00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:57.280]
93 is on my bananza prune, which is not, you know,

[00:31:57.280 --> 00:31:58.180]
already hallucinogen.

[00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:01.100]
It's just for people who hold the farts like me with high blood pressure.

[00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:03.840]
Strong damage is open park church.

[00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:07.800]
Now it's interesting to me that every time there's a big storm as a bunch of churches,

[00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:11.020]
I would think that God, if they were really like on the right team,

[00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:12.700]
that God would protect them, wouldn't you?

[00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:13.440]
Wrong religion.

[00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:16.900]
Oh, and like I said, if they were on the right team, they're on the wrong team.

[00:32:18.380 --> 00:32:21.220]
Tarenchel Donport did more than just soap, brown or county yesterday afternoon.

[00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:23.760]
They seriously damaged an open park church.

[00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:27.260]
The Christola Roca Church.

[00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:33.640]
Christola Roca, 3,000 West Prospect Road, was deemed unsafe Tuesday after heavy rains caused the roof to cave in.

[00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:35.880]
There were an angel, Diaz said.

[00:32:37.260 --> 00:32:39.120]
Angel Diaz, what team did he play for, Chris?

[00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:41.300]
Heck, if I know.

[00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:44.140]
Sounds like either a ball player or a jockey, angel, Diaz.

[00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:45.420]
That's bad.

[00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:49.460]
When the sky clear, the church's gym was nearly destroyed.

[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.500]
What am I laughing about? That's bad.

[00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:52.200]
What's bad?

[00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:53.480]
What's bad about angel, Diaz?

[00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:54.180]
Oh, I don't know.

[00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:56.820]
There's just a thing about all these names that ended in Z.

[00:32:57.020 --> 00:32:58.660]
And I'm saying George, what about it?

[00:32:59.120 --> 00:32:59.460]
I don't know.

[00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:00.440]
Just something about it.

[00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:05.080]
Tuesday's storm brought 1.3 inches of rain to Oakland Park in other parts of Fort Lauderdale.

[00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:08.240]
Nearly 1.7 inches of rain fell over Miami International.

[00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:10.560]
Oh, brother, the Lord is really pissed off.

[00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:13.680]
Maybe that's why all those flights are so hours and hours late.

[00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:15.640]
The last few days, what is that all about?

[00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:19.460]
I know they had computer glitch on Friday, but today's Wednesday last time I checked.

[00:33:19.620 --> 00:33:23.500]
Well, what's that all about besides really crappy service and scary stuff?

[00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:24.180]
What is that?

[00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:25.180]
I don't know.

[00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:29.580]
Today, church officials in Congress waited for a building inspector outside the church.

[00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:33.200]
A distrac Diaz told reporters the congregation had been growing.

[00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:36.100]
Now plans for expanding the church have been put on hold.

[00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:37.780]
He said the church had no insurance.

[00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:42.140]
I'm just trusting the Lord Diaz said, well, that's not a good idea, angel.

[00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:44.640]
It's not a good idea.

[00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:50.020]
You are my special angel, Bobby Helmsings now for young QA.

[00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:51.000]
Remember that?

[00:33:51.180 --> 00:33:52.000]
You are a special.

[00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:52.840]
I bet you got it.

[00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:55.160]
I know you got Jingle Bell Rock.

[00:33:55.260 --> 00:33:56.260]
I mean, that's also not saying.

[00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:57.120]
Is that Bobby Helms?

[00:33:57.920 --> 00:33:58.500]
Jingle Bell?

[00:33:58.840 --> 00:33:59.300]
Jingle Bell?

[00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:00.980]
Yeah, there you go.

[00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:03.220]
I told you I knew you had all of them.

[00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:06.300]
I mean, what kind of outstanding name would the church have this mixed collection?

[00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:08.180]
You're on my special angel.

[00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:08.620]
Angel.

[00:34:09.640 --> 00:34:11.220]
And this is for angel Diaz.

[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:16.940]
Okay, that's enough of that.

[00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:19.060]
Bobby Helms, I believe that was on deck of records.

[00:34:19.180 --> 00:34:20.260]
No one asked me before you.

[00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:22.400]
No, I do not have Jingle Bell Rock in four years.

[00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:23.080]
You don't have that.

[00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:23.640]
Not yet.

[00:34:24.180 --> 00:34:24.940]
Jingle Bell, Jingle Bell.

[00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:25.460]
Give me five minutes.

[00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:26.920]
I don't want to hear it.

[00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:28.080]
I do want to hear this, though.

[00:34:28.740 --> 00:34:30.540]
As if the ...

[00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:32.260]
...

[00:34:32.260 --> 00:34:32.680]
...

[00:34:32.680 --> 00:34:32.760]
...

[00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:32.780]
...

[00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:33.100]
...

[00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:33.180]
...

[00:34:33.180 --> 00:34:33.460]
...

[00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:33.520]
...

[00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:33.520]

[00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:38.320]
...

[00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:38.320]

[00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:38.320]

[00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:38.320]

[00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:38.320]

[00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:38.320]

[00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:38.320]

[00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:38.320]

[00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:38.540]
...

[00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:39.420]
...

[00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:39.420]

[00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:39.420]

[00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:39.420]

[00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:39.700]
...

[00:34:39.700 --> 00:34:40.620]
...

[00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:40.620]

[00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:40.980]
...

[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:21.540]
...

[00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:28.260]
...

[00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:28.260]

[00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:28.260]

[00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:28.700]
...

[00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:31.140]
...

[00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:39.420]
That was really from an ancient one because the lucky ...

[00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:42.660]
...

[00:35:42.660 --> 00:35:42.780]
...

[00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:42.780]

[00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:42.780]

[00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:42.780]

[00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:42.800]
...

[00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:46.940]
...

[00:35:46.940 --> 00:35:49.300]
us songmeisters on your head parade.

[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:53.700]
You know, when you listen to all this stuff and you realize how corny and cheesy it was?

[00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:54.220]
Sure.

[00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:58.900]
It goes to show that everything is like a big deal in its time.

[00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:03.160]
Back in those days in the early 50s, it was like you're sitting at home and of course

[00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:04.340]
you'd grown up listening to radio.

[00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:05.180]
There was no TV.

[00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:10.020]
And all of a sudden you're watching these images and here are like living and breathing

[00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:14.900]
real people live on live TV, which of course we have very little live TV now except for

[00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:16.960]
these boneheads on talking head news channel.

[00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:21.520]
But it was, you know, it was, it was what it was.

[00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:25.640]
Very, like I said, cheesy, but it was exciting.

[00:36:26.420 --> 00:36:30.300]
It was almost as exciting as the final episode of the soprano.

[00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:31.020]
Yeah, almost.

[00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:33.000]
7.22 on Chris's poll today.

[00:36:33.100 --> 00:36:35.420]
We're going to kick some very serious ass today, believe you me.

[00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:37.220]
I'm just an ass-kicking kind of mood.

[00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:38.680]
Don't ask me, don't ask me why.

[00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:43.400]
Where do things stand with New Hampshire Democrats since the Democratic presidential candidates

[00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:45.700]
debated Manchester on June 3rd?

[00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:47.160]
Well, not too much change.

[00:36:48.260 --> 00:36:53.280]
The CNN WMUR, New Hampshire Union leader debate had exactly what it's supposed to do.

[00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:55.900]
It helped the New Hampshire voters sort out the candidates, it says.

[00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:58.740]
Well, in early April, they were all over the place.

[00:36:58.900 --> 00:37:03.540]
The front runners, swillery and Barack Obama and John Edwards were closely matched.

[00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:05.100]
Oh, I see, it did make a change.

[00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:07.940]
Clinton was at 27, Edwards 21, Obama was 20.

[00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:10.020]
It was essentially a jump ball, it says.

[00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:12.240]
Who was highest after the debate?

[00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:13.080]
Swillery.

[00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:16.820]
According to the new poll of New Hampshire Democratic primary voters released this week,

[00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:19.660]
the New York Senator has surged and believed 36 percent.

[00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:21.380]
Obama's got 22 percent.

[00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:24.640]
He's moving up in the second place, and Edwards has lost support.

[00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:27.900]
He dropped from 21 to 12 percent, even with a haircut.

[00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:33.420]
The debate got another player into the game, Bill Richardson, who's support has reached

[00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:34.140]
10 percent.

[00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:35.440]
He's peeking now.

[00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:36.920]
He's peeking in.

[00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:39.860]
Just like that judge, I was peeking at that hanging Chad.

[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:44.680]
A poll involved telephone interviews with 309 New Hampshire adults who planned to vote

[00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:46.940]
in the Democratic primary, January 22nd next year.

[00:37:47.460 --> 00:37:50.580]
And the picture gets a little bit clearer if we assume Al Gore will not run.

[00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:54.380]
Clinton needs to lead New Hampshire with 39, followed by Obama with 24.

[00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:57.380]
Edwards, 14, and Richardson, 11, if you don't go into the mix.

[00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:01.940]
Clinton seems to have impressed Democrats by taking charge into the debate.

[00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:05.720]
It says, the differences among us, our minor, Clinton said, the differences between us

[00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:06.840]
and the Republicans are major.

[00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:10.040]
And of course, the other guys, their last name, isn't Clinton.

[00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:14.980]
After which candidate is the strongest leader, Democrats pick Clinton hands down.

[00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:16.640]
None of the others even came close.

[00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:20.980]
Oh, it's that Democratic death wish you can smell it.

[00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:23.220]
Oh, like rotting flesh.

[00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:25.840]
But can she be elected Democrats think so?

[00:38:25.900 --> 00:38:28.980]
They see Clinton as the candidate for the best chance of meeting the Republicans next

[00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:29.180]
year.

[00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:32.540]
Even though Obama does so much better in head to head in all the polls, but nevertheless,

[00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:33.700]
these people are Hillary.

[00:38:33.700 --> 00:38:36.700]
They ought to be Hillary if they're Hillary, don't you think?

[00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:37.680]
Absolutely.

[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:41.280]
Democrats think she's likable.

[00:38:41.620 --> 00:38:42.240]
Not really.

[00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:44.420]
She runs third unlike ability.

[00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:46.580]
Obama comes across as the most likable Democrat.

[00:38:47.820 --> 00:38:50.860]
Here's how he answered a question about making English the official language.

[00:38:51.260 --> 00:38:54.740]
When we get distracted by those kinds of questions, I think we do it with the service to the American

[00:38:54.740 --> 00:38:55.120]
people.

[00:38:55.540 --> 00:38:58.340]
It says, now what does that mean?

[00:38:58.520 --> 00:38:59.260]
Why do they put that in there?

[00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:00.040]
Is that significant?

[00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:01.280]
I don't know.

[00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:02.880]
Sounds like a non-answer to me.

[00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:06.140]
Well, Edwards may have lost points because he criticized other Democrats.

[00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:09.160]
Senator Clinton and Obama didn't say anything about how they were going to vote until they

[00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:11.940]
appeared on the floor of the Senate and voted it would say about the Iraq War funding

[00:39:11.940 --> 00:39:12.680]
building the debate.

[00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:14.380]
They were among the last people to vote.

[00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:17.740]
Richardson may have gained points because he sounded firm and decisive.

[00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:20.040]
First day as president, I would shut down Gitmo.

[00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:23.920]
He said during the debate, I would shut down Abukar and secret prisons.

[00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:25.660]
That's the moral authority that we don't have.

[00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:28.480]
The key factor behind we would Clinton's lead.

[00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:29.440]
Oh, boy.

[00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:29.820]
Women.

[00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:35.300]
Clinton leads Obama by two to one among Democratic women, among Democratic men.

[00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:38.400]
Clinton and Obama are just about tied even, Stephen.

[00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:41.680]
For Democrats, the war in Iraq overwhelms all other issues.

[00:39:41.820 --> 00:39:45.040]
57% of New Hampshire Democrats say Iraq is the most important issue for their vote.

[00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:46.800]
That's up from 39% of April.

[00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:50.560]
Even though she's drawn some criticism in the past from anti-war activists, Clinton's

[00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:55.000]
lead is just as strong among Democrats whose top concern is Iraq as it is among Democrats

[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:56.720]
considered about other issues.

[00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:00.700]
I just don't get her at all.

[00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:03.580]
Like I said, her last name is Clinton and she's high profile on the media.

[00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:07.800]
It's like obsessed with her and they just don't want to tell us what a...

[00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:08.940]
It's the Illuminati baby.

[00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:10.120]
It's all part of the plan.

[00:40:10.420 --> 00:40:11.080]
It's all the scam.

[00:40:11.580 --> 00:40:11.900]
Is that it?

[00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:12.260]
Yeah.

[00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:15.280]
You think the Bilderbergers have their finger deep inside?

[00:40:15.500 --> 00:40:15.840]
Back them.

[00:40:16.020 --> 00:40:16.340]
The whole deal.

[00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:16.700]
That's right.

[00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:17.840]
And the trilateral commission.

[00:40:18.060 --> 00:40:19.840]
And the trilateral committee and the Illuminati, right?

[00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:22.460]
Who is the Moe overpaid?

[00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:23.320]
Who is the full question?

[00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:25.280]
Who is Moe overpaid?

[00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:28.540]
Big company CEO is 352.

[00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:29.840]
ProJocks 201.

[00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:31.740]
That number needs to go away up there.

[00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:33.280]
ProJocks.

[00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:36.280]
Roger, Clinton's $28 million.

[00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:38.020]
I mean, well, what are we talking about?

[00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:38.840]
He won't agree.

[00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:39.600]
He had big deal.

[00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:39.920]
Okay.

[00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:40.660]
Fat ass.

[00:40:41.380 --> 00:40:42.960]
Fat ass with a crappy attitude.

[00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:44.420]
He makes me gag.

[00:40:46.740 --> 00:40:48.020]
And of course, pay rod.

[00:40:48.380 --> 00:40:50.100]
Although he always got to keep all those chicks happy.

[00:40:50.140 --> 00:40:50.760]
You know how that is.

[00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:59.160]
Actors 51, lawyers 41, Realtors 38, 36, Neal 32, overpaid my ass.

[00:40:59.660 --> 00:41:00.680]
They paid me 10 million here.

[00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:01.420]
It would even be close.

[00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:05.400]
It would even be close to what I should be compensated for this spectacular job I've

[00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:05.640]
been doing.

[00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:10.360]
Burning in the hot midnight oil over a hot microphone here day after day after hour

[00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:10.900]
at it.

[00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:12.060]
It's just amazing to me.

[00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:14.420]
And let's see.

[00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:16.660]
Stockbrokers 12 Rockstar is only nine.

[00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:17.780]
Soloment in Webe.

[00:41:18.060 --> 00:41:18.740]
So Tonto Nove.

[00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:20.680]
See, we have to do everything.

[00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:20.980]
Trial.

[00:41:20.980 --> 00:41:21.900]
Well, now how about French?

[00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:23.580]
Here, you have to do everything English and French.

[00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:24.660]
How do you say that in French?

[00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:26.020]
I don't know how you say only in French.

[00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:32.540]
How do you say, uh, Wunder, Twackat, Sank, Sets, Sets, Sets.

[00:41:32.540 --> 00:41:33.060]
God forbid.

[00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:34.600]
Weat is eight.

[00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:35.420]
Weat.

[00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:36.140]
I don't know about nine.

[00:41:36.300 --> 00:41:36.680]
A Weat.

[00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:38.140]
As in gross, I'm in your backyard.

[00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:39.180]
Weat.

[00:41:39.180 --> 00:41:39.460]
Nine.

[00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:41.360]
How do you say nine in the French?

[00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:42.920]
I don't know.

[00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:43.200]
Sets.

[00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:43.660]
Nuh.

[00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:44.800]
Nuh.

[00:41:45.100 --> 00:41:45.280]
Nuh.

[00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:46.400]
I'm getting noon.

[00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:47.860]
I don't know.

[00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:51.160]
What's that?

[00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:52.220]
It's a Japanese craft.

[00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:52.920]
It's not bad enough.

[00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:55.920]
You're polluting all of my friends out there and radiolimitering with that anime garbage.

[00:41:56.140 --> 00:41:56.880]
You'd better stop Mr.

[00:41:57.340 --> 00:41:57.340]

[00:41:57.360 --> 00:41:59.240]
Why are you still ahead of the gaming industry in the people?

[00:41:59.740 --> 00:42:00.060]
What is it?

[00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:01.420]
Nasthatsin and Japanese?

[00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:02.120]
No.

[00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:02.560]
Zhu.

[00:42:03.340 --> 00:42:03.740]
Zhu.

[00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:04.900]
There he goes again.

[00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:05.620]
Oh, eh.

[00:42:07.660 --> 00:42:08.320]
Tan Zhu.

[00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:09.920]
Yes.

[00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:11.720]
739 Nepal.

[00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:12.920]
What's with the Japanese?

[00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:16.380]
That because your daughter was over there, is it because you did that anime that perverted

[00:42:16.380 --> 00:42:19.460]
an anime staff while we all like the Japanese in her family and she took the

[00:42:19.460 --> 00:42:22.300]
classes and spent a year over there and what about that Japanese exchange

[00:42:22.300 --> 00:42:27.800]
to a girl a kid? What about her? Did you impregnate her or what? No, she was just a

[00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:32.340]
little girl. How old was she? Well she was she was 17 for Christ's sake first of

[00:42:32.340 --> 00:42:34.860]
all and a second of all she was. I thought a little girl that she was old enough

[00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:41.280]
for you wasn't my type. No like the Asian. She was sweet and wonderful and nice

[00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:45.380]
and she wasn't your type. She was an exchange student. You get a bang in there. I'm getting there.

[00:42:45.380 --> 00:42:48.840]
I understand. Are you an age girl? No, of course I can't. Especially when they look like

[00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:53.660]
12-year-old boys. Oh, well, one thing about the Japanese, I told you this many times

[00:42:53.660 --> 00:42:58.240]
you always argue with me, the Chinese man, no matter what you're into, there's some really

[00:42:59.220 --> 00:43:02.220]
amazing looking Chinese people. They have a bigger pool than you're all from.

[00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:06.600]
But the Japanese are bigger, there are a lot of Chinese, so you get a lot of

[00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:11.640]
variance there. Yeah, especially here, 400,000. Never the last. 400,000 Chinese, man. Right.

[00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:13.460]
They have floodasses.

[00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:22.080]
Yeah,

[00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:25.160]
yeah,

[00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:33.500]
we do songs with like hooks and concepts, right?

[00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:36.060]
For freedom and I'm trying to go flat

[00:43:36.060 --> 00:43:37.360]
Some of the problems

[00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:39.500]
Check this out y'all

[00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:40.340]
Huh

[00:43:40.340 --> 00:43:43.340]

[00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:59.180]
In recent weeks we've seen a dramatic increase in the use of abusive language expressions of Hayden of Senities and Comments by readers to stories appearing in Capitol Hill Blue. The discourse has turned from meaningful debate to a free-for-all where readers hurl insults at each other, scream of Senities and Capitol letters, and strive to see how many nasty adjectives they can use in a single post. Sound familiar? Mm-hmm. I reset the span filters several times to try to catch those comments, but too much hyperbole still gets through. I spend several hours each

[00:51:59.180 --> 00:52:26.420]
day going through the moderation queue because readers continue to ignore our stated policies on discussion. I waited through more than 200 such comments last night before going to bed. I got up at 5 o'clock this morning and found more than 300 more awaiting action. My column Monday on Senator Julie Berman brought the anti-Semites out in force, Phil Hoskins column over the weekend about gay pride brought a hoard of gay basures, if we publish this story about Barack Obama the racist way in, at times the cycle seems endless and repetitive.

[00:52:27.260 --> 00:52:37.020]
The Internet has the potential to become a worthwhile public forum on issues that they, but it's also a breeding ground for a hate, intolerance and anger, and we see far too much of that in political discussions.

[00:52:37.980 --> 00:52:47.940]
Reasonable discussion is impossible when a majority of those who post comments do nothing but throw word bombs at each other while hiding behind anonymous screen names, word bombs, when Obama Grande.

[00:52:48.680 --> 00:53:00.880]
A few weeks ago I discontinued comments directly to news stories and directed those who wanted to discuss stories and topics, to our successful and long-running forum, Reader Rand. A number of readers asked me to reconsider and I decided to give open comments one more chance.

[00:53:01.740 --> 00:53:10.280]
I was wrong to change my original decision despite increased anti-spamming settings the nastiness escalated and the level of discourse devolved into too many shouting matches.

[00:53:10.840 --> 00:53:16.760]
We don't have the time or the resources to spend hours each day dealing with the increasing number of posts that require moderation and attention.

[00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:25.860]
Reader Rand is a moderated discussion board that encourages open but civil discussion on a broad range of topics. It is and should be the place where readers express their views.

[00:53:26.300 --> 00:53:34.240]
In the coming days we'll be moving to a new software system on Reader Rand that enhances and improves the form as well as its rule as the premier political discussion board on the Internet.

[00:53:34.240 --> 00:53:41.140]
But as a moderated discussion board Reader Rand has rules about civility and use of language, it doesn't tolerate obscenity nor should it.

[00:53:41.460 --> 00:53:44.920]
It doesn't allow members to flame or insult each other nor should it to flame.

[00:53:45.860 --> 00:53:46.340]
FAMING!

[00:53:46.980 --> 00:53:52.700]
It requires that elected officials be addressed by proper names not insulting nicknames or obscenity-laced references and it should.

[00:53:53.080 --> 00:53:54.680]
So the UCC stops here.

[00:53:55.780 --> 00:54:02.920]
I hope we can have an open and free-wing discussion on topics of capital blue without turning into the hate-filled tirades that dominate so many other political websites.

[00:54:02.920 --> 00:54:10.180]
I was wrong. Capital Hill Blue is a news site. We're not a bar room brawl. I apologize to readers for allowing it to become one.

[00:54:10.300 --> 00:54:10.960]
Says Doug Thompson.

[00:54:11.260 --> 00:54:13.380]
He's disgusted and fed up and nauseated.

[00:54:14.140 --> 00:54:17.980]
Just like when we started at the NeoRarges.com thing there were we had the comments.

[00:54:18.540 --> 00:54:18.680]
Right.

[00:54:19.300 --> 00:54:19.900]
Same thing.

[00:54:20.320 --> 00:54:20.560]
Sure.

[00:54:21.100 --> 00:54:21.840]
Same people.

[00:54:22.380 --> 00:54:22.960]
Same idiots.

[00:54:23.240 --> 00:54:25.940]
Same morons and all these were screaming at each other and insulting each other.

[00:54:25.940 --> 00:54:28.200]
Nothing new with the show. Nothing new with us.

[00:54:28.360 --> 00:54:29.740]

1119-560WQM and Chris, you're making strides.

[00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:42.480]
You're taking big gigantic steps.

[00:56:42.720 --> 00:56:43.540]
800 votes.

[00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:44.640]
All right.

[00:56:45.040 --> 00:56:45.980]
All right, man.

[00:56:46.180 --> 00:56:46.640]
They're doing it.

[00:56:46.740 --> 00:56:48.960]
They're doing it just for you because I think you're such a fine.

[00:56:49.420 --> 00:56:51.800]
I would say, upstanding, sitting down American.

[00:56:52.420 --> 00:56:52.560]
Right.

[00:56:52.720 --> 00:56:52.880]
Thank you.

[00:56:53.380 --> 00:56:55.060]
It's been a stupid story, by the way.

[00:56:55.160 --> 00:56:57.880]
Attending a Fort Myers Miracle game is an easy decision to set.

[00:56:58.140 --> 00:57:00.660]
This is from our buddy Felix the Cat or whoever it hell is.

[00:57:01.260 --> 00:57:02.260]
It sends me a lot of good stuff.

[00:57:02.420 --> 00:57:03.060]
All these good stories.

[00:57:03.220 --> 00:57:03.820]
Thanks, Felix.

[00:57:05.460 --> 00:57:08.200]
You're guaranteed fun, family affordable entertainment and a beautiful ball.

[00:57:08.300 --> 00:57:09.800]
Now, the miracle used to be the Miami miracle.

[00:57:09.920 --> 00:57:10.160]
Remember that?

[00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:12.180]
They played in Poppano Beach and I used to do appearances there.

[00:57:12.280 --> 00:57:12.980]
Remember those days, George?

[00:57:13.380 --> 00:57:13.500]
No.

[00:57:13.860 --> 00:57:15.480]
Oh, maybe before your old time.

[00:57:15.620 --> 00:57:16.160]
That was an IOD.

[00:57:16.420 --> 00:57:16.800]
It was, right.

[00:57:17.360 --> 00:57:17.880]
That was an IOD.

[00:57:18.980 --> 00:57:19.860]
Well, you wouldn't have gone anyway.

[00:57:20.040 --> 00:57:21.080]
You wouldn't be going to no ball games.

[00:57:21.680 --> 00:57:21.840]
Right.

[00:57:21.840 --> 00:57:27.580]
The miracle also understand that sometimes people have second thoughts about their choice of entertainment and want to flip flop their decision.

[00:57:27.760 --> 00:57:29.280]
They want to do a little waffle routine.

[00:57:29.600 --> 00:57:31.240]
Kind of like a swillery on the war.

[00:57:31.360 --> 00:57:31.980]
You know, a little waffle.

[00:57:34.580 --> 00:57:40.120]
That's why the miracle will give fans an opportunity to have a change of heart on Billy Donovan night June 20th.

[00:57:40.140 --> 00:57:41.660]
Now, Chris knows who Billy Donovan is.

[00:57:41.900 --> 00:57:42.100]
Yes.

[00:57:42.940 --> 00:57:48.640]
University of Florida basketball coach Billy Donovan made a U-turn last week and returned to Gainesville after agreeing to a five-year,

[00:57:48.640 --> 00:57:52.560]
and we're 27 and a half million dollar contract with the NBA's Orlando Magic.

[00:57:53.040 --> 00:57:55.260]
His decision to leave in return wasn't an easy one.

[00:57:55.420 --> 00:57:59.140]
The miracle recognized that we all have tough decisions to make and sometimes want to redo.

[00:57:59.640 --> 00:58:00.120]
Do it over.

[00:58:00.380 --> 00:58:02.000]
Like George on marriage, things like that.

[00:58:03.580 --> 00:58:04.700]
Why do that over?

[00:58:05.900 --> 00:58:08.300]
Well, it says tough decisions to make.

[00:58:09.440 --> 00:58:11.800]
Sometimes we want to remake the decision as well.

[00:58:11.860 --> 00:58:12.260]
I see.

[00:58:12.540 --> 00:58:13.360]
Yeah, you know that's right.

[00:58:13.500 --> 00:58:13.960]
Yeah, I know.

[00:58:14.120 --> 00:58:14.500]
Good point.

[00:58:14.780 --> 00:58:15.120]
Thank you.

[00:58:15.660 --> 00:58:20.320]
Fans that purchase a ticket at the box office for the 705 PM game against the Tampa Yankees.

[00:58:20.400 --> 00:58:22.460]
This is on June 20th.

[00:58:23.180 --> 00:58:24.520]
That's a week from today.

[00:58:24.680 --> 00:58:25.200]
Next Wednesday.

[00:58:26.420 --> 00:58:29.500]
We'll see if they experience a sea-solve emotions like Billy Donovan encountered.

[00:58:29.880 --> 00:58:34.240]
If at any time during the game they're not sure they want to be at Hammond Stadium that they're in Fort Myers.

[00:58:34.240 --> 00:58:36.500]
They can leave it and negotiate a release from their ticket purchase.

[00:58:36.800 --> 00:58:40.240]
Oh, this is so...it's just...I don't know.

[00:58:40.440 --> 00:58:41.500]
It makes me weak at the knees.

[00:58:41.860 --> 00:58:42.520]
And I'm sitting down.

[00:58:43.880 --> 00:58:50.240]
Patrons that experience a Billy Donovan moment will have the option to sit down with local attorney and strike a deal for an out clause from their ticket purchase.

[00:58:50.620 --> 00:58:50.900]
Oh!

[00:58:53.300 --> 00:58:58.080]
Part of the negotiating process will involve making a free throw into our on-site basketball hoop.

[00:58:59.280 --> 00:59:05.840]
Fans that make the easy decision to stay will be entered into a drawing for four tickets to a Florida basketball game in Gainesville this upcoming season.

[00:59:06.260 --> 00:59:08.380]
And we guarantee that Billy Donovan will be there.

[00:59:08.380 --> 00:59:13.100]
For Mayor's own Billy Donovan will throw off the first pitch and Waffles will be available to the concession stand.

[00:59:13.260 --> 00:59:13.960]
What did I tell you?

[00:59:14.320 --> 00:59:17.240]
They're inviting people to do a little Waffle there.

[00:59:18.640 --> 00:59:21.660]
Tickets for Billy Donovan night and the remaining Miracle Season are on sale.

[00:59:21.660 --> 00:59:26.240]
Right now I'm sure everybody in the Fort Myers area, all five of you are listening will be there to change your mind.

[00:59:26.400 --> 00:59:27.700]
I want my money back right now.

[00:59:27.720 --> 00:59:28.440]
This game blows.

[00:59:29.080 --> 00:59:30.820]
Not as much as Joyce, but it blows.

[00:59:30.860 --> 00:59:31.400]
It blows.

[00:59:32.200 --> 00:59:33.500]
Like the wind in a hurricane.

[00:59:33.800 --> 00:59:34.300]
It blows.

[00:59:35.400 --> 00:59:36.580]
806 on the pole.

[00:59:37.180 --> 00:59:39.700]
Not only we're going to get a thousand today, but God only knows.

[00:59:39.940 --> 00:59:40.940]
God only knows.

[00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:41.640]
They're all God!

[00:59:41.800 --> 00:59:42.960]
That kind of number we can put up there.

[00:59:43.380 --> 00:59:44.020]
You know what God says?

[00:59:44.600 --> 00:59:44.720]
What?

[00:59:48.200 --> 00:59:51.900]
That's what God says.

[00:59:52.800 --> 00:59:53.780]
Don't you just love them?

[00:59:54.140 --> 00:59:54.540]
That's great.

[00:59:54.920 --> 00:59:56.380]
You don't have those spots like that, normal.

[00:59:57.000 --> 00:59:58.960]
No, I'm not going to get tired of that with God only knows.

[00:59:59.220 --> 00:59:59.640]
Here we go.

[01:00:00.100 --> 01:00:01.880]
Hey Brian, put the teddy bear back in his sack.

[01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:02.660]
People are talking.

[01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:03.600]
It's not good.

[01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:05.860]
Brian.

[01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:10.340]
Brian probably wants to know one thing about this song.

[01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:11.180]
You like it?

[01:00:11.820 --> 01:00:13.580]
I may not own it.

[01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:14.940]
I was not too bad.

[01:00:15.220 --> 01:00:15.720]
How about it?

[01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:16.220]
It was really close.

[01:00:16.540 --> 01:00:16.860]
It was ballpark.

[01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:17.960]
Close enough.

[01:00:18.380 --> 01:00:20.240]
Close enough for us, and the board goes back.

[01:00:21.060 --> 01:00:22.960]
I'm constipation with art James.

[01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:24.740]
And he downs.

[01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:26.180]
And Alex Trebek.

[01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:27.300]
Well, I hate him, man.

[01:00:27.460 --> 01:00:27.980]
I just...

[01:00:27.980 --> 01:00:28.560]
I know he's Canadian.

[01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:30.920]
And you have to agree with me.

[01:00:30.980 --> 01:00:33.920]
Most Canadian entertainers we like a lot, except of course for Anne's.

[01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:34.280]
True.

[01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:34.620]
Right.

[01:00:34.820 --> 01:00:37.160]
And except for who's the other bitch, Celine Dion.

[01:00:37.260 --> 01:00:37.420]
Right.

[01:00:37.940 --> 01:00:38.980]
But other than that, we like him all.

[01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:40.420]
We like Avril Lavigne.

[01:00:40.660 --> 01:00:41.360]
Right, John Candy.

[01:00:41.660 --> 01:00:42.660]
We like John Candy a lot.

[01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:44.180]
We like Monty Hall back in the day.

[01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:44.560]
Mm-hmm.

[01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:45.240]
What about Camille?

[01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:45.880]
Who?

[01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:46.760]
Pamela.

[01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:49.300]
Yeah, we're just...

[01:00:49.660 --> 01:00:50.240]
Pamela Lee.

[01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:50.900]
Oh boy.

[01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:51.840]
Yeah.

[01:00:52.620 --> 01:00:53.540]
Why'd you do that to me?

[01:00:56.780 --> 01:00:58.780]
In so many Martin Short, we don't like him.

[01:00:59.120 --> 01:00:59.940]
No, not anymore.

[01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:00.440]
What about you?

[01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:01.340]
You have great comedians.

[01:01:01.380 --> 01:01:02.400]
There's so many great German comedians.

[01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:07.560]
All the SCTV people, Eugene Levy, Rick Marannas.

[01:01:07.820 --> 01:01:09.040]
Oh, and you know who you're leaving off?

[01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:09.600]
Who?

[01:01:10.100 --> 01:01:10.940]
Out of sight out of mind.

[01:01:11.620 --> 01:01:12.220]
Oh yeah.

[01:01:12.740 --> 01:01:13.700]
Out of sight is right.

[01:01:14.460 --> 01:01:14.680]
Right.

[01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:16.900]
Every now and then we see him here.

[01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:17.420]
They do?

[01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:20.180]
They put him on something just to keep him in a high sea.

[01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:22.040]
To keep his one testicle happy.

[01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:29.880]
Speaking of that, speaking of testes, a former L.A. Archdiocese priest who escaped prosecution

[01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:36.780]
for sexual abuse on children in 2003 because of a Supreme Court ruling was arrested Thursday.

[01:01:37.020 --> 01:01:39.180]
And obviously last week or maybe tomorrow they're predicting it.

[01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:41.220]
Last Thursday at L.A. International Airport.

[01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:46.820]
Michael Stephen Baker, 58, was arrested at 2 p.m. on suspicion of committing

[01:01:46.820 --> 01:01:49.900]
loot acts upon her child according to Sergeant Dan Scott.

[01:01:51.660 --> 01:01:55.840]
The arrest is in connection with the ongoing investigation into allegations of child molestation,

[01:01:56.100 --> 01:01:59.500]
involving present and former Catholic priest in the L.A. Archdiocese.

[01:01:59.500 --> 01:02:03.800]
According to a statement from the L.A. County District Attorney's Orifice, the L.A.

[01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:08.420]
Times reported in October that investigators opened a new probe of Baker focusing on two

[01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:11.440]
brothers who said they were molested by the now former priest.

[01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:15.180]
The probe had been hindered because of the brothers now live in Mexico.

[01:02:15.620 --> 01:02:19.620]
Oh, but investigators obtained visas last spring so the brothers could be interviewed in

[01:02:19.620 --> 01:02:23.240]
Arizona with or without Mark Lindsay, with or without the ponytail.

[01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:28.420]
Investigators interviewed Lynn Categan, the brothers Tucson-based civil attorney,

[01:02:28.740 --> 01:02:33.300]
who obtained a $1.3 million settlement on their behalf from Baker and the Archdiocese

[01:02:33.300 --> 01:02:34.080]
he told the newspaper.

[01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:38.200]
Officials wouldn't confirm whether Baker's arrest was in connection with the brothers' allegations.

[01:02:38.700 --> 01:02:41.680]
Scott said investigators searched Baker's residences in Huntington Beach in LA.

[01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:42.520]
What is it?

[01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:43.460]
LA Marada.

[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:45.660]
La Marada.

[01:02:45.780 --> 01:02:48.820]
See that whole LA thing, it just bugs me. La Marada.

[01:02:49.460 --> 01:02:49.880]
Excuse me.

[01:02:50.220 --> 01:02:50.680]
No problem.

[01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:53.640]
He said Baker was arrested as he returned from Thailand.

[01:02:54.040 --> 01:02:57.340]
Oh, and several other countries because the airport was a safe place to make the arrest.

[01:02:57.680 --> 01:02:59.120]
I wonder what he was doing in Thailand?

[01:03:00.100 --> 01:03:04.680]
The District Attorney's Office said in the system, and by the way, the good news is our friend Ricky is back from Costa Rica.

[01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:07.660]
Maybe one of these days he'll let me know whether we got later or not and how it was.

[01:03:08.020 --> 01:03:12.840]
And hopefully, all those young girls were like, you know, legal aids, not some 17-year-old Japanese girl.

[01:03:13.100 --> 01:03:14.260]
It looked like a 12-year-old boy.

[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:19.780]
The D.A. is Office said in the system, our charges will be made on Monday and in a rainbow we schedule early next week.

[01:03:19.780 --> 01:03:22.260]
I'm sure you'll be keeping your nose to the grindstone on that.

[01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:23.580]
Right.

[01:03:23.780 --> 01:03:27.880]
And earlier, a criminal charge against Baker was dismissed in 2003 because of a US Supreme Court decision.

[01:03:28.360 --> 01:03:32.620]
Barring prosecution of decades-old sexual abuse cases, Baker left the ministry in 2000.

[01:03:33.900 --> 01:03:38.720]
He told Cardinal Mahoney in 1986 that he had molested children according to the Arts DIC sandbaker.

[01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:45.540]
The art species did not alert police, but rather sent Baker for treatment after which he was assigned to a series of nine other parishes.

[01:03:45.540 --> 01:03:50.100]
Cardinal Mahoney's already acknowledged and apologized for the mistakes made the handling father Baker.

[01:03:50.420 --> 01:03:55.280]
A case that taught many important lessons that I see noted in its 2000 report to the people of God.

[01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:04.460]
Baker had been accused of sexually abusing 23 boys from 1974 to 1999, including at least four after he admitted his molestations to Mahoney's Arts DIC sandbaker.

[01:04:04.460 --> 01:04:05.600]
He would, oh no.

[01:04:06.860 --> 01:04:11.060]
He would place his penis into a sock until the children was a sock puppet named Willie.

[01:04:11.700 --> 01:04:13.100]
Never worked for me.

[01:04:13.820 --> 01:04:14.340]
God.

[01:04:16.860 --> 01:04:17.680]
What Willie?

[01:04:18.520 --> 01:04:19.340]
I was waiting.

[01:04:19.940 --> 01:04:20.660]
The wonder was-

[01:04:20.660 --> 01:04:21.840]
I was wondering how long that would take.

[01:04:24.140 --> 01:04:25.680]
Not yet, it isn't a sock.

[01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:27.520]
It was a sock puppet named Willie.

[01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:30.880]
Well, it wasn't a sock, but well.

[01:04:34.180 --> 01:04:35.200]
817 other pool.

[01:04:35.300 --> 01:04:36.260]
Better rock their world.

[01:04:38.100 --> 01:04:39.420]
Another Catholic priest.

[01:04:39.420 --> 01:04:40.920]
I mean, with a great sense of it.

[01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:44.100]
I guess you got a tip of your hat to the father, you know, for originality.

[01:04:44.460 --> 01:04:44.680]
Sure.

[01:04:45.300 --> 01:04:45.700]
Wow.

[01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:47.800]
What time is the puppet show staring anyway?

[01:04:48.100 --> 01:04:48.180]
Right.

[01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:50.640]
Well, we'll get in a puppet in your panties.

[01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:52.000]
His father, you just have to deceive me.

[01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:52.980]
Right before we pay my level one pay.

[01:04:52.980 --> 01:04:55.140]
I get the breaker what I get so continue with this fall.

[01:04:55.140 --> 01:04:55.900]
Yeah, sure.

[01:04:56.120 --> 01:04:56.480]
Fulderall.

[01:04:56.500 --> 01:04:57.280]
God, what a bastard.

[01:04:57.560 --> 01:04:58.880]
Holy Makinon!

[01:04:59.080 --> 01:05:04.440]
This is Joe Boyle on the voice of the Toronto May Beliefs and you're listening to the Hockey Authority Neal God!

[01:05:04.660 --> 01:05:07.520]
The idea is her figure and even more bizarre.

[01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:11.740]
Well, I mean that a defeat in Iraq will embolden the enemy.

[01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:13.400]
You are a gracious ideas.

[01:05:14.180 --> 01:05:16.620]
And I think the world would be better off if we did leave.

[01:05:17.040 --> 01:05:19.900]
If we didn't, if we didn't, if we left the world, it would be worse.

[01:05:20.120 --> 01:05:21.660]
The world is better off if it's not leave.

[01:05:21.860 --> 01:05:22.500]
You are crazy.

[01:05:22.620 --> 01:05:24.700]
George Boyle and George, I'm not going to invent it.

[01:05:24.980 --> 01:05:27.020]
Inports come from overseas.

[01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:28.520]
He's a brilliant Wednesday.

[01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:29.300]
Only at ABC.

[01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:33.060]
Oh, three more dead American troops, by the way, in that mess and bagged out.

[01:05:33.160 --> 01:05:35.460]
I just thought I would mention that, CNN, is talking about it now.

[01:05:35.460 --> 01:05:37.860]
Very briefly, and then we go into whale shark dies.

[01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:42.660]
Now, that's going to, they have a whole segment on that.

[01:05:42.780 --> 01:05:43.760]
They've got video and a whole deal.

[01:05:44.020 --> 01:05:47.620]
The three more US soldiers who die, we got like a crawl at the bottom of the screen, you know,

[01:05:47.700 --> 01:05:48.720]
in about two seconds.

[01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:53.520]
But now, in Norton, is the second whale shark to die at the Georgia Aquarium this year?

[01:05:53.620 --> 01:05:55.100]
The only ones on this planet.

[01:05:55.100 --> 01:05:57.860]
CNN, and then we're getting a whole story on that with video and a whole deal.

[01:05:58.080 --> 01:06:02.200]
And the name, the name of the Gordon Fisherman, is that important crap?

[01:06:02.580 --> 01:06:03.580]
All of it is very important.

[01:06:03.580 --> 01:06:05.960]
The idea of people at CNN, they got your priority straight.

[01:06:06.080 --> 01:06:06.580]
Let me say it again.

[01:06:06.740 --> 01:06:09.440]
When did they take them off the air now?

[01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:11.960]
Immediately, if not sooner.

[01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:14.980]
By the way, Claude is a frog who is on our Myspace now.

[01:06:15.620 --> 01:06:18.600]
We got 1434, he loves this show, even though he's a frog.

[01:06:19.980 --> 01:06:21.080]
And that darn white of him?

[01:06:21.500 --> 01:06:22.260]
That's a boy Claude.

[01:06:23.980 --> 01:06:25.820]
824, you're going to make a thousand and an easy Chris.

[01:06:26.020 --> 01:06:27.580]
I sold you short, I got to admit it.

[01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:31.320]
I sat down here this morning around the 815, whatever the hell it was.

[01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:33.860]
And I looked at that thing, and it had 500 and some of my votes.

[01:06:33.980 --> 01:06:36.660]
I thought, boy, Fatsers are going to have a tough time getting to a thousand today.

[01:06:37.020 --> 01:06:37.760]
I agreed with you.

[01:06:38.340 --> 01:06:40.320]
And you thought, oh, what was us, baby?

[01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:42.940]
If we ever fall short of a thousand minutes, when you know it's all over,

[01:06:43.100 --> 01:06:45.540]
except when Georgia's on like on a holiday and had 300 votes?

[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:47.480]
It's on a holiday, it's on a Memorial Day.

[01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:49.700]
You can't feel bad about that.

[01:06:50.320 --> 01:06:50.480]
Right.

[01:06:51.020 --> 01:06:54.600]
Of course, if it was like Friday and you had 300 votes, you still wouldn't feel bad about it.

[01:06:54.740 --> 01:06:56.820]
Because you don't feel that it's like what they put you on the air for.

[01:06:58.200 --> 01:06:58.480]
No.

[01:07:01.900 --> 01:07:03.220]
What do they put you on the air for?

[01:07:03.500 --> 01:07:04.940]
They don't actually, they don't put you on the air.

[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:05.160]
Right.

[01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:08.460]
They put you on the air because in my contract it says, I have the choice.

[01:07:08.860 --> 01:07:09.000]
Right.

[01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:12.100]
And you better, you better kiss Norm as ankles for putting that in there.

[01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:13.320]
Okay.

[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:15.520]
Want me to make extra money?

[01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:15.760]
No.

[01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:16.660]
Do the show at the same time.

[01:07:16.760 --> 01:07:16.980]
You don't?

[01:07:17.020 --> 01:07:17.160]
No.

[01:07:17.900 --> 01:07:18.440]
You don't?

[01:07:18.460 --> 01:07:18.620]
No.

[01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:20.460]
Get out of here.

[01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:24.300]
So, yeah, thanks, Norm, for something for screwing you over.

[01:07:26.120 --> 01:07:27.660]
Wouldn't be the first time from what I'm told.

[01:07:28.060 --> 01:07:28.080]
Yeah.

[01:07:29.740 --> 01:07:30.920]
No, are you serious about that?

[01:07:30.940 --> 01:07:31.720]
You don't make an extra dime.

[01:07:31.820 --> 01:07:32.920]
You're doing the show at the same time.

[01:07:32.920 --> 01:07:33.540]
Not extra dime.

[01:07:34.100 --> 01:07:38.440]
Actually, I do, I do a third of the shows over the course of the year, but I don't make an extra dime for it.

[01:07:38.540 --> 01:07:38.620]
No.

[01:07:38.980 --> 01:07:40.220]
What do you mean, do a third of the show?

[01:07:40.380 --> 01:07:44.040]
When you added all of that by do 33 or more percent of all the shows.

[01:07:44.120 --> 01:07:44.940]
20% of all the shows, yes.

[01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:45.500]
20% of all the shows, yes.

[01:07:45.500 --> 01:07:45.820]
20% of all the shows, yes.

[01:07:45.820 --> 01:07:45.900]
20% of all the shows, yes.

[01:07:45.900 --> 01:07:46.140]
20% of all the shows, yes.

[01:07:46.140 --> 01:07:47.760]
20% of all the shows, yes.

[01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:50.580]
20% of all the shows, yes.

[01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:52.740]
20% of all the shows, yes.

[01:07:52.740 --> 01:07:52.960]
Right.

[01:07:53.220 --> 01:07:54.140]
They suck, you know what?

[01:07:54.360 --> 01:07:54.480]
Yeah.

[01:07:55.420 --> 01:07:58.880]
When you come right down, in fact, there's something I want to say to the entire company right now.

[01:07:59.040 --> 01:07:59.420]
Okay, listen.

[01:08:05.420 --> 01:08:06.820]
Yeah, that's it.

[01:08:07.720 --> 01:08:10.200]
LSMFT, baby, lucky strike means fine tobacco.

[01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:16.480]
I mean, it seems to me that any product, for example, all these prescription drugs, they have

[01:08:16.480 --> 01:08:17.560]
in the nightly news every night.

[01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:22.380]
Ask your doctor about, you know, if you drink too much, if you can't pee enough, if you, whatever.

[01:08:23.140 --> 01:08:25.900]
If you're limp, boy, there must be a lot of limp guys out there.

[01:08:25.900 --> 01:08:26.600]
All you heteros.

[01:08:26.860 --> 01:08:27.640]
I imagine there are.

[01:08:27.640 --> 01:08:29.260]
Well, what is that all about?

[01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:29.900]
I don't know.

[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:33.460]
Yeah, seriously, why are there so many limp heterosensual guys?

[01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:35.600]
I don't know if there are so many limp gay guys.

[01:08:37.060 --> 01:08:37.840]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:39.100]
I mean, it could be a medical condition.

[01:08:39.300 --> 01:08:40.020]
I do understand that.

[01:08:40.660 --> 01:08:41.800]
I don't know.

[01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:43.240]
I've never encountered that.

[01:08:43.400 --> 01:08:49.080]
Guys who are homosexual who just can't get the, you know, can't get the job done.

[01:08:49.080 --> 01:08:49.780]
They're all these things.

[01:08:50.200 --> 01:08:53.080]
Maybe it's fear or maybe they're just in the closet or something like that.

[01:08:53.340 --> 01:08:54.000]
I thought of that too.

[01:08:54.620 --> 01:08:55.460]
You think that's what it is?

[01:08:55.560 --> 01:08:55.840]
It could be.

[01:08:56.980 --> 01:08:58.820]
Maybe they need to find somebody of their own life.

[01:08:58.980 --> 01:08:58.980]

[01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:00.360]
Maybe they're barking at me wrong tree.

[01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:01.680]
That could be it.

[01:09:01.780 --> 01:09:07.760]
Maybe that might cause a little arousal there, as opposed to this spousal arousal, which seems to be working well for lots and lots of guys.

[01:09:08.320 --> 01:09:12.080]
And you young guys there, if you're popping vigorous, that movie, that was really cute.

[01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:13.120]
What movie?

[01:09:14.140 --> 01:09:14.940]
The imaginary heroes.

[01:09:15.380 --> 01:09:15.660]
Oh, yeah.

[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:20.420]
Because everybody in the family was like either, they were either drunks or they were pill poppers or smoking the eye.

[01:09:20.840 --> 01:09:21.660]
They were all the gonja.

[01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:23.680]
They were all doing something constantly.

[01:09:24.860 --> 01:09:27.720]
In fact, toward the end of the movie, there's the scene at the New Year's party.

[01:09:27.860 --> 01:09:30.340]
You know where the two were, where, what's his name?

[01:09:30.440 --> 01:09:33.420]
They share the kiss, you know, and then they wake up in bed in the morning.

[01:09:33.740 --> 01:09:35.120]
So you might be, but I'm not.

[01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:35.960]
I'm not what it might be.

[01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:42.600]
And Sigourney, we were the only time we see her in that segment, and she's hovering over the porcelain bus, puking her guts out.

[01:09:43.840 --> 01:09:44.300]
Remember that?

[01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:44.880]
Yep.

[01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:47.160]
Just to see it for just a fraction of a second.

[01:09:49.260 --> 01:09:52.280]
I don't know if that's a dysfunctional family or just the average American family.

[01:09:52.380 --> 01:09:52.620]
I don't know.

[01:09:52.620 --> 01:09:52.980]
They're all there.

[01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:57.960]
And of course, the one scene we're doing a car, the two buddies, who became, I think, more than just buddies.

[01:09:58.500 --> 01:10:01.360]
And he hands them something and it turns out it's a viagra.

[01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:02.120]
And he eats it anyway.

[01:10:03.140 --> 01:10:03.920]
That's the best part.

[01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:06.860]
Well, you can never be, I guess you can never be too rigid, you know?

[01:10:07.020 --> 01:10:07.260]
Mm-hmm.

[01:10:09.100 --> 01:10:10.240]
Even ruffles have ridges.

[01:10:11.820 --> 01:10:13.020]
830 votes on the pool, boy.

[01:10:13.300 --> 01:10:14.820]
I don't know where this is coming from.

[01:10:14.900 --> 01:10:18.460]
We must have somebody out there in Spedigrill, Fimbri, trying to tell everybody that they got the audience.

[01:10:18.540 --> 01:10:19.760]
You haven't got squat, Mr.

[01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:22.180]
You are right back in the dumper where you were before.

[01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:27.400]
See, the one thing about the trends, if you get one fluke month in there, it'll last you three months.

[01:10:29.100 --> 01:10:29.200]
Right?

[01:10:29.820 --> 01:10:29.820]

[01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:32.300]
Or maybe it lasted longer than that.

[01:10:32.680 --> 01:10:32.900]
Alright.

[01:10:33.080 --> 01:10:34.280]
Let me try to figure this out.

[01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:37.840]
November, December, January.

[01:10:38.140 --> 01:10:38.280]
Okay?

[01:10:38.840 --> 01:10:39.260]
Anyaero.

[01:10:40.060 --> 01:10:41.060]
So there's one.

[01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:44.380]
And then you got two when you drop off November.

[01:10:44.820 --> 01:10:45.080]
Right?

[01:10:45.500 --> 01:10:45.680]
Right.

[01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:48.720]
And then when you drop off, both of them are December's three.

[01:10:49.540 --> 01:10:53.100]
It lasts you like five months until the journey until that fluke month finally drops out.

[01:10:53.160 --> 01:10:54.380]
It lasts you five months.

[01:10:54.940 --> 01:10:59.300]
And you're running around like a robin' the red breast, you know, with your chest all puffed up.

[01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:00.160]
Oh, look at us.

[01:11:00.220 --> 01:11:01.340]
We got the young hip audience.

[01:11:01.560 --> 01:11:02.320]
We're really kicking ass.

[01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:03.340]
We're the top sports set.

[01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:07.280]
And then of course that bogus month with a fixed, you know, wire diaries drops off.

[01:11:07.540 --> 01:11:09.980]
And you're right back in the crap where we always have been for two years plus.

[01:11:10.560 --> 01:11:11.080]
Am I right, Chris?

[01:11:11.520 --> 01:11:11.660]
Right.

[01:11:12.080 --> 01:11:12.180]
Right.

[01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:14.540]
I don't know what they're thinking about.

[01:11:15.100 --> 01:11:22.060]
And if they little dog actually jumpship and they'll come back over there and it looks very unlikely that he's going to be back there any time after that deal ends up.

[01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:23.560]
They're going to be really screwed.

[01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:28.420]
Because the rumor that Barry Jackass was friend that they're going to put Sid the kid on the note.

[01:11:28.620 --> 01:11:30.760]
I mean, that is a recipe for death.

[01:11:30.760 --> 01:11:33.500]
That would be like putting the Kenny and Bo Mourning show on.

[01:11:35.860 --> 01:11:36.760]
What I just say.

[01:11:37.340 --> 01:11:38.080]
You heard me.

[01:11:38.300 --> 01:11:38.800]
You heard me.

[01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:38.800]

[01:11:39.260 --> 01:11:43.120]
As a matter of fact, maybe they'll make a trade, you know, like in sports they make trades all the time.

[01:11:43.120 --> 01:11:46.400]
And maybe we'll make a swap rhymes with flop.

[01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:47.160]
Hmm.

[01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:49.360]
As in belly flop.

[01:11:50.620 --> 01:11:54.120]
One thing about Kenny though, he just keeps prodding along, you know, he's...

[01:11:54.680 --> 01:11:55.560]
I almost feel bad.

[01:11:55.560 --> 01:11:57.300]
I don't even know him, but I feel bad for him, you know.

[01:11:57.560 --> 01:11:58.360]
Do you feel bad for him?

[01:11:58.580 --> 01:11:58.700]
Who?

[01:11:59.820 --> 01:12:00.700]
Kenny was his name.

[01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:01.720]
Kenny W. Walker.

[01:12:02.140 --> 01:12:02.440]
No, no.

[01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:03.300]
I know what his name is.

[01:12:03.460 --> 01:12:04.560]
I know what his name is.

[01:12:04.820 --> 01:12:05.140]
What are you?

[01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:06.460]
Is some kind of a simple thing or what?

[01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:08.880]
Do you think I'm an old feeble, uh, old timer?

[01:12:09.420 --> 01:12:09.780]
No, right.

[01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:11.620]
I know my crap.

[01:12:12.200 --> 01:12:13.960]
You know what someone pointed out the other day to me?

[01:12:13.980 --> 01:12:14.520]
Who was that?

[01:12:15.020 --> 01:12:18.720]
Um, all these other sports stations that I like, you know, come and go on.

[01:12:18.980 --> 01:12:19.640]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:12:19.640 --> 01:12:20.260]
I don't have one thing in common.

[01:12:21.900 --> 01:12:22.540]
Stupid guys.

[01:12:25.340 --> 01:12:26.660]
No, he didn't work at the fan.

[01:12:27.640 --> 01:12:29.460]
He was still with us when the fan was on here.

[01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:30.680]
You sure?

[01:12:32.300 --> 01:12:33.120]
I'm pretty sure.

[01:12:33.540 --> 01:12:34.460]
He was at 940.

[01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:36.620]
I think that's when he went a...

[01:12:36.620 --> 01:12:37.600]
I don't really know what happened.

[01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:39.620]
Did he bail out or did he clearance a...

[01:12:39.620 --> 01:12:41.800]
You know, and he had a falling out and weren't sleeping together anymore.

[01:12:41.800 --> 01:12:42.600]
What was the deal there?

[01:12:42.860 --> 01:12:45.040]
I was an intern when he was a producer here.

[01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:49.320]
I believe he was marrying some girl or whatever.

[01:12:49.700 --> 01:12:54.100]
And her dad was hooking up with like a stockbroker or something like that.

[01:12:54.280 --> 01:12:54.380]
Yeah.

[01:12:54.860 --> 01:12:55.060]
Yeah.

[01:12:55.380 --> 01:12:56.840]
And so he left to go do that.

[01:12:56.960 --> 01:12:59.780]
And then I guess he washed out because he came back to radio.

[01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:03.520]
Oh, he looked to become a stockbroker?

[01:13:03.740 --> 01:13:04.340]
Yes, I'm like that.

[01:13:04.540 --> 01:13:05.860]
I think that's all about 940 bucks.

[01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:08.780]
He's got a lot of money.

[01:13:08.780 --> 01:13:08.920]

[01:13:51.420 --> 01:13:51.420]

[01:13:51.420 --> 01:13:51.420]

[01:13:51.420 --> 01:13:51.420]

[01:13:51.420 --> 01:13:51.420]

He's got a lot of money.

[01:14:33.880 --> 01:14:35.300]
He's got a lot of money.

[01:14:35.300 --> 01:14:37.300]
No.

[01:15:05.300 --> 01:15:05.340]
No.

[01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:12.920]
Wow.

[01:15:12.920 --> 01:15:13.260]
Wow.

[01:15:13.260 --> 01:15:15.880]
I'm just concerned.

[01:15:18.240 --> 01:15:19.280]
ホド have put curse.

[01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:19.280]

[01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:19.280]

[01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:19.280]

[01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:19.280]

[01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:19.280]

[01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:19.280]

[01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:21.760]
I'm driving in 2002.

[01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:21.940]
I started a disconnect here.

[01:15:21.940 --> 01:15:24.280]
You have�� stupid radio condenser.

[01:15:24.280 --> 01:15:24.280]

[01:15:32.300 --> 01:15:34.300]
I rode a bike with you generally.

[01:15:24.280 --> 01:15:27.920]
who say, call for Philip Mara, or is there was a journey.

[01:15:29.060 --> 01:15:32.520]
The interesting part about that being, I said, those spots about it being a mild

[01:15:32.520 --> 01:15:35.460]
cigarette, those were like camels, they were like cancer sticks.

[01:15:37.780 --> 01:15:40.480]
Because that was before, I don't know if it was before, I'm sure it was before

[01:15:40.480 --> 01:15:44.640]
that they have filtered cigarettes. There were those things back then. Cancer sticks.

[01:15:46.520 --> 01:15:50.120]
Right, and even as an unsmokered myself now, I think, I just,

[01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:53.120]
I think it's carried away to the point of just obnoxious.

[01:15:54.640 --> 01:15:58.180]
For example, when I was down to a week ago, a Saturday, I had my infamous lunch, you know,

[01:15:58.260 --> 01:16:01.540]
with my two buddies, and after lunch went on to the patio of this place,

[01:16:03.680 --> 01:16:05.340]
and each run wrapped in ice-stogie.

[01:16:06.120 --> 01:16:11.440]
Thanks, Ernie. And at any rate, you know, we were actually going to light them on there in the patio,

[01:16:11.440 --> 01:16:14.300]
because God forbid, they would take you off and put you in the slamer for 10 days.

[01:16:14.680 --> 01:16:18.220]
And here comes one of the waiters, oh, you can't smoke that out, here you have to take it over, yeah.

[01:16:18.220 --> 01:16:19.400]
Oh, okay.

[01:16:20.520 --> 01:16:23.920]
Boy, militant. I think you ought to be able to smoke a cigar anywhere you want.

[01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:27.040]
If I'm going to light up a big fat one if there would be a good one in the afternoon,

[01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:29.740]
I should be able to do that in a cigar too, right?

[01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:36.140]
847 votes on the poll. We got 1,000 licked, baby. We got it made in the shade with Kool-Aid.

[01:16:36.980 --> 01:16:41.660]
The former substitute teacher, who's the new staccat, will be Strong's Villa Ohio High School football team,

[01:16:42.100 --> 01:16:45.540]
left a Corp. Hancock's yesterday, but she'll walk out of jail on Friday.

[01:16:47.540 --> 01:16:50.760]
Christine Scarlett. Oh, what a great name that is, isn't it? Great.

[01:16:51.380 --> 01:16:56.860]
Christine Scarlett could have received her for 17 years in prison for the sexual battery of her former student, Steven Bratigan,

[01:16:57.280 --> 01:17:01.300]
who was 17 in 2002, when the four-year affair began. She played guilty in May.

[01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:07.820]
But Cairoga County County, please judge Dick Ambrow, who has spared her from any hard prison time,

[01:17:08.140 --> 01:17:13.720]
opting instead to shock her with three days in the county jail, followed by a hundred-eundays house arrest in five years' probation.

[01:17:14.800 --> 01:17:19.320]
Bratigan's mother, Mary, told the judge that her son, I want you to listen very carefully to this.

[01:17:20.560 --> 01:17:28.240]
Her mother, Mary, told the judge that her son was a boy trapped inside a man's body, when Scarlett took him on a first date to the local dairy queen.

[01:17:30.640 --> 01:17:36.020]
Mary, Bratigan blamed Scarlett for destroying her family, but she declined to ask Ambrow to treat the teacher severely.

[01:17:38.240 --> 01:17:42.300]
The mother told the judge that her son was a boy trapped inside a man's body.

[01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:50.160]
Afterwards, Bratigan's father, Lawrence, criticized the census as too lenient.

[01:17:50.440 --> 01:17:56.100]
He also complained that strong billed school officials avoided accountability for failing to report Scarlett's crimes to the police.

[01:17:57.100 --> 01:18:02.560]
The 8th District Court of Appeals rule last week that Bratigan's law, civic-using school officials of negligence, was filed too late,

[01:18:02.560 --> 01:18:05.260]
and the judge, John Russo, was corrected dismissive.

[01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:07.040]
And that's the end of that tale so far.

[01:18:08.380 --> 01:18:11.280]
Born too late, that was the ponytails, wasn't it born too late?

[01:18:11.800 --> 01:18:12.380]
I'll find out.

[01:18:12.780 --> 01:18:14.080]
I'm trying to think of what the record looked like.

[01:18:14.220 --> 01:18:15.560]
It certainly wasn't on cadence records.

[01:18:15.980 --> 01:18:21.020]
Cain's you don't forget, it was the Everly Brothers in Andy Williams and the court deaths, purple and silver.

[01:18:22.160 --> 01:18:22.880]
Cain's records.

[01:18:23.320 --> 01:18:28.660]
Roger Williams, Jane Morgan, it was fast in nation, what are we looking for?

[01:18:29.160 --> 01:18:31.000]
Born too late, but it's not working.

[01:18:32.100 --> 01:18:32.760]
Why, have you got it?

[01:18:33.260 --> 01:18:35.060]
Well, I don't know, but my program was in work.

[01:18:35.180 --> 01:18:36.480]
Well, you probably was in the show film.

[01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:37.800]
Even if you got it, you can't find it.

[01:18:38.900 --> 01:18:40.420]
It's kind of like some of us.

[01:18:40.520 --> 01:18:41.800]
We may have it, but we can't find it.

[01:18:41.860 --> 01:18:43.020]
Well, it's just the way nature is.

[01:18:43.340 --> 01:18:44.820]
The Lord works in mysterious ways.

[01:18:46.440 --> 01:18:47.420]
848 votes on a pool.

[01:18:47.780 --> 01:18:48.500]
What would you rather have?

[01:18:48.840 --> 01:18:52.240]
Brains, real brains, or...

[01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:54.060]
How do I say it?

[01:18:55.880 --> 01:18:56.540]
With your mouth?

[01:18:56.540 --> 01:19:00.000]
Oh, what do you mean, real goods?

[01:19:01.120 --> 01:19:02.500]
Real goods down there.

[01:19:02.580 --> 01:19:02.980]
Goods.

[01:19:03.420 --> 01:19:04.720]
Oh, I'd rather have the brains.

[01:19:06.740 --> 01:19:09.400]
Well, see, I say that because, you know, it's all I got.

[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:11.000]
Who is Moe overpaid?

[01:19:11.200 --> 01:19:12.000]
849 votes.

[01:19:12.140 --> 01:19:15.220]
Big company CEO of Moe overpaid, 4006, almost half.

[01:19:16.420 --> 01:19:19.340]
ProJocs 232, ridiculous, outrageous salaries.

[01:19:20.020 --> 01:19:22.700]
I'm not just...

[01:19:22.700 --> 01:19:26.100]
Actors 57, lawyers 51, Realtors 42,

[01:19:26.100 --> 01:19:27.300]
Neo 37.

[01:19:27.940 --> 01:19:29.080]
And you know what, I didn't mind that.

[01:19:29.160 --> 01:19:30.740]
Whoever sent the pool and put my name on it.

[01:19:30.820 --> 01:19:31.620]
It's far with me.

[01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:33.240]
Jellicy...

[01:19:33.240 --> 01:19:35.120]
Did I ask you a couple weeks ago if we had that?

[01:19:35.300 --> 01:19:37.300]
Jellicy, Frankie Lane or somebody saying that.

[01:19:37.880 --> 01:19:38.240]
Jellicy.

[01:19:38.740 --> 01:19:41.300]
He probably even had Jellicy windows.

[01:19:41.960 --> 01:19:42.880]
What do they call those things?

[01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:44.420]
Jellicy lines and a window.

[01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:46.440]
No, not Jellicy.

[01:19:46.680 --> 01:19:48.420]
There's no such word as Jellicy, okay?

[01:19:48.600 --> 01:19:49.040]
What are you saying?

[01:19:49.120 --> 01:19:50.160]
Kind of a dumb, goi or what?

[01:19:51.240 --> 01:19:51.600]
Jellicy.

[01:19:51.700 --> 01:19:52.360]
I think that's what they're called.

[01:19:53.080 --> 01:19:53.280]
What?

[01:19:54.300 --> 01:19:54.660]
Jellicy.

[01:19:54.660 --> 01:19:56.240]
Get out of here.

[01:19:56.480 --> 01:19:59.280]
Oh, I'm going to Google it.

[01:20:00.580 --> 01:20:01.380]
Jellicy windows.

[01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:04.900]
If I'm wrong, man, it's going to be pretty embarrassing.

[01:20:05.060 --> 01:20:05.620]
How much do we get?

[01:20:05.720 --> 01:20:08.840]
It's a Jellicy, J-L-O-U-S-I-E.

[01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:11.900]
And then it says, do you mean Jellicy windows?

[01:20:14.580 --> 01:20:15.720]
Yeah, Jellicy windows.

[01:20:16.280 --> 01:20:18.100]
Oh, I see because it's I-E on the end.

[01:20:18.440 --> 01:20:18.880]
Jellicy.

[01:20:20.360 --> 01:20:21.460]
That's how you say it?

[01:20:21.620 --> 01:20:21.840]
Yeah.

[01:20:21.840 --> 01:20:24.620]
My whole life, then, I've been calling them Jellicy windows.

[01:20:25.580 --> 01:20:26.540]
Why, Jellicy?

[01:20:27.300 --> 01:20:28.520]
I'm Jellicy of your brains.

[01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:31.560]
Well, some of us grew up downhill.

[01:20:33.180 --> 01:20:34.940]
Jellicy in houses full of Jellicy.

[01:20:35.240 --> 01:20:36.020]
I'm looking at Wikipedia.

[01:20:36.580 --> 01:20:36.740]
Sure.

[01:20:36.820 --> 01:20:40.700]
Is a slanted window covering, typically a shutter or window covering,

[01:20:41.760 --> 01:20:45.120]
which consists of a set of parallel angled slabs, Jellicy.

[01:20:45.700 --> 01:20:45.980]
Mm-hmm.

[01:20:46.200 --> 01:20:46.920]
Not Jellicy.

[01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:48.060]
Jellicy.

[01:20:48.280 --> 01:20:50.820]
You see how I learned something on this show already just because I'm dumb?

[01:20:50.820 --> 01:20:53.380]
Like I said, I rather have the big package in Fotainment.

[01:20:53.980 --> 01:20:54.240]
Right.

[01:20:57.060 --> 01:20:59.080]
857 votes on the...what are you talking about?

[01:20:59.880 --> 01:21:00.440]
In Fotainment.

[01:21:00.500 --> 01:21:01.360]
Well, where did that come from?

[01:21:01.780 --> 01:21:02.620]
I pulled it out of my ace.

[01:21:03.080 --> 01:21:03.260]
Oh.

[01:21:04.080 --> 01:21:05.060]
That's your ace in the hole.

[01:21:05.240 --> 01:21:06.840]
Like they said in the Godfather's dream, remember that?

[01:21:07.100 --> 01:21:07.320]
Uh-huh.

[01:21:08.080 --> 01:21:08.840]
That's what...what's his name?

[01:21:08.940 --> 01:21:09.980]
Eli Wallach was said to me.

[01:21:10.060 --> 01:21:10.060]

[01:21:10.160 --> 01:21:10.720]
To fake priest.

[01:21:11.260 --> 01:21:11.780]
I have an ace.

[01:21:11.940 --> 01:21:12.920]
It's sancers, full of them.

[01:21:13.360 --> 01:21:15.380]
As we say in America, you're my ace in the hole.

[01:21:16.880 --> 01:21:18.640]
And then, of course, Ega, I was eating the canolaes.

[01:21:18.760 --> 01:21:19.940]
Who was the ace hole then, huh?

[01:21:19.940 --> 01:21:21.340]
Ha-ha-ha.

[01:21:21.440 --> 01:21:21.880]
Gotcha.

[01:21:22.320 --> 01:21:24.360]
Here, you look so skinny, you eat it.

[01:21:25.600 --> 01:21:29.140]
That's him, where Connie is just like tying the...

[01:21:29.140 --> 01:21:29.420]
Careful.

[01:21:29.580 --> 01:21:30.340]
The tip of the canolaes.

[01:21:30.360 --> 01:21:30.600]
Yeah.

[01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:32.340]
Well, I'm as she did.

[01:21:32.640 --> 01:21:33.800]
We can't talk about this.

[01:21:33.860 --> 01:21:34.960]
You're kind of like...

[01:21:34.960 --> 01:21:35.420]
Oh, I'm sorry.

[01:21:37.240 --> 01:21:41.060]
Filmmaker, Michael Lora, appeared for an interview on the June 12th episode of ABC's Good Morning America

[01:21:41.060 --> 01:21:46.280]
yesterday to defend the premise and arguments made in his latest film, Sickle, which comes out tomorrow...

[01:21:46.280 --> 01:21:46.460]
Friday.

[01:21:47.220 --> 01:21:47.880]
I believe.

[01:21:48.300 --> 01:21:52.340]
Which documents the state of America's healthcare system as sorry and sad as it is.

[01:21:52.560 --> 01:21:53.100]
You go, Mike.

[01:21:54.240 --> 01:21:59.100]
In the interview, more asserts that the healthcare in America is a system that essentially is run by greed.

[01:21:59.560 --> 01:22:00.540]
And I would say you are...

[01:22:00.540 --> 01:22:02.200]
Absolutely correct, sir.

[01:22:02.240 --> 01:22:06.660]
More also went on to defend his tactics in the film, including taking ailing 9-11 workers to Guantana,

[01:22:06.660 --> 01:22:07.860]
or Vian Cuba for treatment.

[01:22:08.300 --> 01:22:11.920]
I'm using sat-tired to make a larger point politically and socially more sick.

[01:22:12.200 --> 01:22:13.260]
And you want to call that a stunt.

[01:22:13.540 --> 01:22:16.540]
It's certainly no different than what would you do on Good Morning America in any given day,

[01:22:16.540 --> 01:22:19.560]
except you actually wouldn't confront the government in any way I would do it.

[01:22:20.140 --> 01:22:22.060]
You would tell him, Mike, stick it to him, baby.

[01:22:22.180 --> 01:22:22.660]
How do you like that?

[01:22:23.400 --> 01:22:25.800]
He stuck it to him there on Good Morning America.

[01:22:25.800 --> 01:22:29.260]
They should only croak, hubsie, and dread as the Iranians would say.

[01:22:29.840 --> 01:22:31.700]
As Makhmoud Ahmed in the job would say.

[01:22:32.060 --> 01:22:32.840]
Ahmed, what's his name?

[01:22:32.980 --> 01:22:33.380]
Makhmoud Ahmed.

[01:22:33.960 --> 01:22:34.820]
I don't know what's in it.

[01:22:35.840 --> 01:22:37.560]
Is everybody's name Makhmoud Ahmed?

[01:22:38.100 --> 01:22:38.420]
Or Mohammed.

[01:22:38.840 --> 01:22:39.160]
Or Mohammed.

[01:22:39.500 --> 01:22:39.640]
Oh.

[01:22:40.100 --> 01:22:41.880]
Speaking of Mohammed, how's my satellite guy doing?

[01:22:41.980 --> 01:22:42.580]
How you doing, Mohammed?

[01:22:42.600 --> 01:22:43.860]
Don't call when I take any calls.

[01:22:44.820 --> 01:22:46.020]
Are you there when he called?

[01:22:46.280 --> 01:22:47.140]
Two weeks ago, Mohammed?

[01:22:47.420 --> 01:22:47.440]
Yep.

[01:22:49.560 --> 01:22:52.080]
One thing about him, man, if you ever, have you ever met him?

[01:22:52.480 --> 01:22:53.100]
Sure, many times.

[01:22:53.400 --> 01:22:53.600]
Oh.

[01:22:53.840 --> 01:22:54.460]
He's a good guy.

[01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:55.120]
Yes he is.

[01:22:55.240 --> 01:22:56.520]
But he's always like on the verge of death.

[01:22:57.320 --> 01:22:58.220]
He's got some issues.

[01:22:58.440 --> 01:22:58.560]
Yeah.

[01:22:58.840 --> 01:23:00.080]
He's got some health issues there.

[01:23:00.380 --> 01:23:00.780]
Bad heart.

[01:23:01.120 --> 01:23:01.980]
He's got a crappy heart.

[01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:06.220]
866 votes, jealousy, wonder.

[01:23:06.360 --> 01:23:09.220]
You see, it's a good thing I said that because if I wouldn't have said that,

[01:23:09.300 --> 01:23:10.180]
Chris wouldn't have corrected me.

[01:23:10.420 --> 01:23:12.480]
By the way, I apologize to Chris for being a robber.

[01:23:12.480 --> 01:23:14.120]
Well, George and I both corrected you.

[01:23:14.420 --> 01:23:15.360]
Well, screw George.

[01:23:15.680 --> 01:23:16.120]
Nothing, no.

[01:23:18.620 --> 01:23:20.840]
Well, I mean, George is always just no matter what I say.

[01:23:20.940 --> 01:23:22.880]
If I would have said jealousy, what has said jealousy?

[01:23:23.540 --> 01:23:24.100]
And you wonder why?

[01:23:24.140 --> 01:23:24.740]
Because he's jealous.

[01:23:25.100 --> 01:23:25.540]
That's right.

[01:23:26.020 --> 01:23:27.260]
He's just trying to get you on the ground early.

[01:23:27.880 --> 01:23:29.520]
He likes being an Ojyan provocateur.

[01:23:30.100 --> 01:23:31.680]
That's what he gets paid the big bucks to be.

[01:23:31.820 --> 01:23:31.920]
I know.

[01:23:32.100 --> 01:23:32.280]
Yeah.

[01:23:32.480 --> 01:23:34.320]
And one thing, I'll tell you one thing, when you play tapes,

[01:23:34.460 --> 01:23:35.400]
they sure don't disagree with you.

[01:23:35.700 --> 01:23:36.240]
No, they don't.

[01:23:37.360 --> 01:23:39.340]
Here's the fact that says, from P,

[01:23:40.040 --> 01:23:42.400]
hey, Neil and George, my mom smoked Territans.

[01:23:42.440 --> 01:23:44.700]
They had the great slogan, I'd rather fight than switch.

[01:23:44.840 --> 01:23:45.280]
That's right.

[01:23:46.500 --> 01:23:47.720]
I'd rather fight than switch.

[01:23:47.780 --> 01:23:50.260]
Boy, if people wouldn't have told me what brand there was,

[01:23:50.360 --> 01:23:51.520]
and everyone thought that in the Zoon years,

[01:23:51.940 --> 01:23:53.620]
I remember apartments and parliament light.

[01:23:53.920 --> 01:23:55.840]
I remember those billboards for those cigarettes.

[01:23:56.520 --> 01:23:56.880]
Territans?

[01:23:57.060 --> 01:23:57.180]
Yeah.

[01:23:57.560 --> 01:23:58.540]
I'd rather fight than switch.

[01:23:58.780 --> 01:24:00.700]
And then the person in the commercial would have a black eye.

[01:24:01.220 --> 01:24:03.260]
You could do a poll on the best cigarette ad slogan ever.

[01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:05.160]
Not the greatest poll, but it will fill some time.

[01:24:05.820 --> 01:24:07.820]
And you know what, we would start to pull by saying, probably.

[01:24:07.820 --> 01:24:08.260]
explicit.

[01:24:15.680 --> 01:24:17.780]
Those are the days, it was a lot more fun when we had

[01:24:17.780 --> 01:24:19.140]
cigarette commercial longTV.

[01:24:19.920 --> 01:24:21.640]
And then magazines and all over the place.

[01:24:21.900 --> 01:24:24.760]
Big ads for Salem and it'd always be this beautiful young

[01:24:24.760 --> 01:24:27.700]
couple, you know, in the forest, it would a big smile on their face.

[01:24:27.880 --> 01:24:29.340]
Yeah, that's before they got the lung cancer.

[01:24:29.540 --> 01:24:29.580]
Yeah.

[01:24:30.260 --> 01:24:32.260]
It's before the big tumors started roaring in their lungs.

[01:24:32.960 --> 01:24:34.540]
And they had this big smile in the face,

[01:24:34.540 --> 01:24:36.800]
like they were about to do something really very sensual,

[01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:39.960]
you know having to do with private parts and that's because they were smoking

[01:24:39.960 --> 01:24:42.720]
Salem they didn't bother telling us where they were sticking them

[01:24:42.720 --> 01:24:50.280]
but they're never less 866 yet this is this is this is what kills me is that

[01:24:50.280 --> 01:24:53.240]
they let all these prescription drugs go on there they're killing God only

[01:24:53.240 --> 01:24:56.640]

okay

[01:26:27.260 --> 01:26:29.440]
RC

[01:26:29.440 --> 01:26:29.740]
you

[01:26:56.300 --> 01:27:02.840]
Brains are washed out of land and trees, but trees should always be.

[01:27:06.120 --> 01:27:13.360]
They care more about American idols and getting spooked by this pile.

[01:27:13.800 --> 01:27:17.540]
They won't grow till it gets more poisonous.

[01:27:31.860 --> 01:27:44.180]
But this powers tools for people to accumulate the current unrest and money they would get on society.

[01:27:44.180 --> 01:27:45.940]
Better Такson.

[01:27:45.940 --> 01:27:46.180]
Because they are infected by the past, Western China's fear of being.

[01:27:46.180 --> 01:27:47.520]
However they know that we're struggling with the system.

[01:27:50.900 --> 01:27:53.240]
202-560 WQM, Happy Wednesday to you.

[01:27:53.380 --> 01:27:55.900]
Well, I sure bring back a lot of memories, you know, most of them bad.

[01:27:57.420 --> 01:27:59.160]
874 votes on the poll, that's good, though.

[01:27:59.880 --> 01:28:00.560]
That's really good.

[01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:04.040]
And this is the two subpoenas that are being issued to two former White House officials,

[01:28:04.460 --> 01:28:07.160]
the first to be subpoenaed in the Farad U.S. Attorney's Investigation.

[01:28:07.560 --> 01:28:08.440]
They're being subpoenaed.

[01:28:09.360 --> 01:28:12.860]
The chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee today issued a subpoena to Sarah Taylor,

[01:28:13.240 --> 01:28:14.480]
former White House political director.

[01:28:14.480 --> 01:28:18.540]
At about the same time, it was announced the House Judiciary Committee will issue a subpoena

[01:28:18.540 --> 01:28:24.480]
in the same case to former White House counsel Harriet Myers, the anxious Harriet Myers.

[01:28:26.300 --> 01:28:30.400]
Both committees say that also subpoenaed documents from the White House, a first in the investigation.

[01:28:30.900 --> 01:28:34.320]
Committee's division subpoenas for official and documents from the Justice Department.

[01:28:34.680 --> 01:28:37.440]
The committees are investigating whether the firings of the eight U.S. Attorney's last year

[01:28:37.440 --> 01:28:41.360]
were politically motivated, is the Pope Jewish, and whether the White House was involved.

[01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:44.700]
Taylor resigned from a White House job a couple of weeks ago.

[01:28:44.840 --> 01:28:46.880]
Myers resigned her White House post in January.

[01:28:47.320 --> 01:28:50.420]
President Bush has nominated Myers to serve on the Supreme Court later, of course,

[01:28:50.520 --> 01:28:52.820]
with due renomination and embarrassment and humiliation.

[01:28:53.400 --> 01:28:56.960]
A day earlier, the White House spokesman Tony Fratt, though, said the last back-to-be-mails

[01:28:56.960 --> 01:29:00.700]
prove to investigators by the Justice Department, provided to them, shows again that there was

[01:29:00.700 --> 01:29:02.600]
no wrongdoing in the replacement of U.S. Attorney's.

[01:29:02.860 --> 01:29:03.080]
Right.

[01:29:03.920 --> 01:29:07.720]
Senator Patrick Leahy of Remundo Chairs, the Senate Judiciary Committee, has been authorized

[01:29:07.720 --> 01:29:11.720]
to subpoena several crew and informer White House officials including Taylor, Myers, and

[01:29:11.720 --> 01:29:12.220]
Carl Rowe.

[01:29:12.440 --> 01:29:16.040]
Two Democratic congressional sources say they decided not to subpoena Rowe because they're

[01:29:16.040 --> 01:29:19.680]
voting their case by talking to and gathering information from lower level witnesses and

[01:29:19.680 --> 01:29:25.140]
officials before they get to the more senior, more important, important witnesses like Carl

[01:29:25.140 --> 01:29:25.360]
Rowe.

[01:29:25.440 --> 01:29:25.840]
Hey, Carl.

[01:29:25.960 --> 01:29:26.380]
You fair.

[01:29:26.460 --> 01:29:26.940]
That one, Ann.

[01:29:27.740 --> 01:29:28.620]
Like he's fallen somebody.

[01:29:29.480 --> 01:29:30.340]
I'll tell you one thing.

[01:29:30.400 --> 01:29:31.800]
These Nazis must be fallen somebody.

[01:29:32.880 --> 01:29:34.280]
Not see best, Dardos.

[01:29:35.300 --> 01:29:36.420]
8.76 on the pool.

[01:29:36.600 --> 01:29:40.460]
I think this is the hour we get close to like 9.50 and then we ease on into a thousand

[01:29:40.460 --> 01:29:41.120]
last hour.

[01:29:41.900 --> 01:29:42.460]
Right, Chris?

[01:29:42.760 --> 01:29:43.040]
You bet.

[01:29:43.880 --> 01:29:43.880]

[01:29:44.260 --> 01:29:44.820]
Don't be jealous.

[01:29:47.120 --> 01:29:49.200]
All my life, I thought they were jealousy windows.

[01:29:49.400 --> 01:29:50.940]
I never really thought of what I meant.

[01:29:51.120 --> 01:29:51.620]
And you know something?

[01:29:51.980 --> 01:29:53.480]
Really when you come right down, what does that mean?

[01:29:53.600 --> 01:29:54.240]
Anyway, jealousy.

[01:29:54.460 --> 01:29:55.020]
What was it?

[01:29:55.140 --> 01:29:57.580]
It looks French, so it means something French, I know.

[01:29:57.780 --> 01:29:58.600]
Oh, God.

[01:29:58.760 --> 01:29:59.400]
No, thank God.

[01:29:59.440 --> 01:29:59.920]
I don't have those.

[01:30:00.460 --> 01:30:01.060]
Oh, sorry.

[01:30:01.180 --> 01:30:02.540]
The cloud up there in there, wherever you are.

[01:30:02.540 --> 01:30:03.580]
Cloud the French guy.

[01:30:05.680 --> 01:30:08.100]
Hey, there's nothing wrong with us having a French guy in my space.

[01:30:08.300 --> 01:30:08.480]
One.

[01:30:10.620 --> 01:30:12.300]
I'm sure you probably saw this on the news.

[01:30:12.480 --> 01:30:15.100]
It's just, is this the only Paris Hilton story we're going to have today?

[01:30:15.220 --> 01:30:15.900]
I hope I pray.

[01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:16.380]
Oh, geez.

[01:30:16.780 --> 01:30:17.340]
Oh, what?

[01:30:17.600 --> 01:30:18.340]
So what?

[01:30:18.660 --> 01:30:19.220]
Only one?

[01:30:19.740 --> 01:30:20.460]
Solomon Théuno.

[01:30:21.200 --> 01:30:23.160]
Although I didn't have the one from yesterday I never got to.

[01:30:23.580 --> 01:30:25.700]
Paris Hilton says she's no longer going to act dumb.

[01:30:25.980 --> 01:30:26.920]
I didn't know it was an act.

[01:30:27.240 --> 01:30:27.700]
No, me either.

[01:30:27.920 --> 01:30:28.700]
Nobody else did either.

[01:30:29.320 --> 01:30:30.160]
She's good then.

[01:30:30.420 --> 01:30:30.640]
Wow.

[01:30:30.640 --> 01:30:31.660]
I thought it was cool.

[01:30:32.020 --> 01:30:32.580]
Good at something.

[01:30:33.840 --> 01:30:37.780]
Paris Hilton's parents visited their daughter after breezing past all the others waiting

[01:30:37.780 --> 01:30:38.600]
to see loved ones.

[01:30:38.760 --> 01:30:38.840]
Right.

[01:30:39.020 --> 01:30:42.540]
And incident that raised new complaints that the rest is receiving special treatment.

[01:30:44.060 --> 01:30:47.340]
The visit came less than a week after your home was reassigned to the house of rest days

[01:30:47.340 --> 01:30:48.860]
after being jailed for violating parole.

[01:30:49.280 --> 01:30:52.620]
The 26 year old celebrity later ordered back to jail in case you haven't heard.

[01:30:53.420 --> 01:30:56.340]
In case you've been on the moon for the last two days.

[01:30:57.220 --> 01:31:01.640]
Alvina Floyd, one visitor to the Twin Towers Correctional Facility, waited more than

[01:31:01.640 --> 01:31:03.380]
four hours to visit her fiance.

[01:31:03.800 --> 01:31:05.260]
Alvina, that sounds dark to me.

[01:31:05.400 --> 01:31:05.680]
I don't understand.

[01:31:05.860 --> 01:31:06.420]
It's a racial thing.

[01:31:07.260 --> 01:31:08.020]
It's a money thing.

[01:31:08.120 --> 01:31:08.880]
Don't you understand it?

[01:31:09.100 --> 01:31:09.380]
Mm-hmm.

[01:31:09.700 --> 01:31:14.160]
And the white folks have the money and that's why they are po-folk so they get behind end.

[01:31:15.600 --> 01:31:18.700]
It normally takes two hours and Floyd 20 blame the Hilton's for the delay.

[01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:19.900]
Good for you, Alvina.

[01:31:20.400 --> 01:31:21.220]
I have to be a work leader.

[01:31:21.380 --> 01:31:22.920]
She said, I can't wait here all day.

[01:31:23.540 --> 01:31:23.900]
Dang.

[01:31:24.700 --> 01:31:28.820]
Chattani Alverson 23, said she was hustled out of the jail's visiting room, moments after

[01:31:28.820 --> 01:31:32.180]
her husband walked in because of the Hilton's, she was told to come back after lunch.

[01:31:32.760 --> 01:31:36.600]
Oh, that's like when I got in that plane that time and the BG sent her to the first class

[01:31:36.600 --> 01:31:37.100]
taken up.

[01:31:37.200 --> 01:31:37.460]
Remember that?

[01:31:37.680 --> 01:31:38.000]
Yeah, you.

[01:31:38.820 --> 01:31:41.140]
There was an America worst airlines, by the way.

[01:31:41.880 --> 01:31:42.920]
Oh, they've canceled your reservation.

[01:31:43.080 --> 01:31:44.580]
They nobody have canceled my reservations.

[01:31:44.620 --> 01:31:49.280]
The airline has stuck all of us back in their coach because the BG's are saying that

[01:31:49.280 --> 01:31:50.560]
we're going to take up the first class.

[01:31:51.420 --> 01:31:54.460]
And you know something after that, I think a couple of them croaked or at least the

[01:31:54.460 --> 01:31:55.700]
Morris did anyway.

[01:31:57.880 --> 01:32:00.160]
And that will teach them to mess with the Lord, you know what?

[01:32:05.640 --> 01:32:07.260]
Steve Whitmore, Sheriff Spokesman.

[01:32:32.360 --> 01:32:34.260]
I bet you Joyce said something to do with that too.

[01:32:34.640 --> 01:32:35.840]
That's from an impacted fart.

[01:32:36.120 --> 01:32:39.620]
See, that's what happens when you hold them in too long, you croak, you burst inside.

[01:32:40.600 --> 01:32:44.120]
Steve Whitmore, Sheriff Spokesman said it was routine for our profile to meet to receive visitors

[01:32:44.120 --> 01:32:47.500]
during lunch, a time when the visiting room is normally cleared and closed.

[01:32:48.400 --> 01:32:52.420]
The visit came shortly after the LA County Board of Supervisors ordered Sheriff Lee back

[01:32:52.420 --> 01:32:56.440]
out of respond by next week to allegations of favoritism for reassigning Hilton the House

[01:32:56.440 --> 01:33:00.560]
arrest at the time back at set an undisclosed medical condition as the reason for making

[01:33:00.560 --> 01:33:01.100]
the decision.

[01:33:01.280 --> 01:33:04.580]
It was those burpees, those churpees in her ass.

[01:33:06.040 --> 01:33:10.400]
Hilton was sent to a medical ward where Sheriff's official set a cost $1,100 a day to house a

[01:33:10.400 --> 01:33:13.760]
female in LA made compared to $99 a day in the general population.

[01:33:15.340 --> 01:33:22.320]
And that's something that the taxpayers of California are paying $1,100 a day to house that

[01:33:22.320 --> 01:33:28.460]
bitch with her millions and millions of inherited money that Mary Teederman who regularly visits

[01:33:28.460 --> 01:33:33.260]
the jail system monitor for the ACLU said the area where Hilton was being housed was usually reserved

[01:33:33.260 --> 01:33:36.380]
for high security inmates or those worse off than Hilton has appeared.

[01:33:37.040 --> 01:33:40.800]
I don't know what her health issue was but you have got to have a pretty intense medical

[01:33:40.800 --> 01:33:45.120]
condition or mental health problem to be part of that jail she'd be saying she's got the love bug

[01:33:45.120 --> 01:33:46.660]
as in her being a love bug.

[01:33:46.680 --> 01:33:49.900]
She's got a well you know that all the fresh and so on so it's got to bug up their ass well.

[01:33:49.900 --> 01:33:55.160]
Yes, I think that there's more to it than meets the eyes they say and just like the love bug its name is her beak.

[01:33:55.780 --> 01:33:56.140]
Yeah.

[01:33:58.100 --> 01:33:58.460]
Bitch.

[01:34:00.120 --> 01:34:03.400]
Nasty sloppy horrendous talentless bitch.

[01:34:04.740 --> 01:34:09.320]
You know that comma I read yesterday the one about the Paris is a hero whatever you know.

[01:34:09.320 --> 01:34:16.880]
It's the truth we're drowning in a sea of her soul just like we drown in a sea of Anna Nicole all these talentless sluts.

[01:34:19.940 --> 01:34:26.400]
Anna Nicole she married that 400 year old guy to you know so that she can inherit the $80 million he had.

[01:34:27.380 --> 01:34:32.760]
She had zero talent other than she was you know I don't know that she was good in the sack but she was at least busy.

[01:34:33.020 --> 01:34:35.520]
You know right right she was busy in the sack.

[01:34:35.520 --> 01:34:41.340]
Everybody in America claimed to have been the father of that baby and that's because they wanted to inherit that guy's $80 trillion.

[01:34:43.380 --> 01:34:48.320]
$803 votes on a pool but that thing has slowed down to a crawl there's $804 a Chris they're coming in by the ones.

[01:34:48.840 --> 01:34:52.120]
They're not coming in with those nice chunks like we usually have.

[01:34:53.780 --> 01:34:56.300]
If the audience lets us down there's only one thing I want to say to them.

[01:35:03.120 --> 01:35:07.020]
Yeah well that was back in the days when there you know TV auctions they used to have auctions.

[01:35:07.360 --> 01:35:14.700]
When I hit my first satellite dish you know the big dish right back in the days when just about everything was in the clear there was nothing encrypted and everything was on there.

[01:35:15.080 --> 01:35:22.680]
Well that was some really fabulous stuff including all those infomercials not like the pre-packaged ones we have today like the Ron Pope Peel one.

[01:35:22.680 --> 01:35:26.500]
But those were like more schmaltzy ones you know.

[01:35:27.980 --> 01:35:34.220]
There was that one guy who supposedly now won the Ron Pope Peel infomercials his Jewish uncle or whatever is Morris.

[01:35:35.560 --> 01:35:37.980]
How does it go like Ron Pope Peel have a Jewish uncle?

[01:35:38.180 --> 01:35:41.340]
I don't understand that maybe I don't know maybe Ron Pope Peel is Jewish what do you think?

[01:35:41.880 --> 01:35:44.080]
His daughter sure looks like she looks like her real princess.

[01:35:44.920 --> 01:35:46.020]
What explains the things?

[01:35:46.560 --> 01:35:50.600]
Yeah I think maybe she used that vagimatic.

[01:35:52.400 --> 01:35:55.300]
You know I could play that probably once.

[01:35:55.740 --> 01:35:56.640]
Can I play it?

[01:35:58.320 --> 01:36:02.040]
Ladies are you tired of unwanted hands creeping into your panty?

[01:36:02.100 --> 01:36:04.180]
Oh well I think that's about that.

[01:36:05.480 --> 01:36:07.500]
That's as deeply as we're delving into there I'll say.

[01:36:07.780 --> 01:36:10.160]
I don't remember what it was like it was Bob and Tom I know that.

[01:36:10.420 --> 01:36:14.900]
So if it was Bob and Tom A it was probably pretty funny and B it might have been a little bit dirty so we better not play it.

[01:36:16.560 --> 01:36:18.960]
But I tell you what we will play one of these days soon.

[01:36:19.680 --> 01:36:20.840]
She gets to the bottom of that.

[01:36:22.300 --> 01:36:25.300]
I'm going to tell you if Jolly Joe well he didn't say that it was her.

[01:36:25.600 --> 01:36:27.080]
I'll grant him that he said corporate.

[01:36:27.600 --> 01:36:29.160]
Corporate doesn't mind you to play that no more.

[01:36:30.180 --> 01:36:33.280]
Well they're scared she's got a soul if she if she catches wind of it okay.

[01:36:33.620 --> 01:36:36.260]
I'll be more than happy to play it right right to her face okay.

[01:36:36.360 --> 01:36:40.120]
Hey Joyce you know you bitch you you horror you whatever.

[01:36:40.540 --> 01:36:42.200]
I got some wind she can catch.

[01:36:42.200 --> 01:36:43.500]
Yeah there you go.

[01:36:44.320 --> 01:36:46.560]
Don't start with that again it might come from that though.

[01:36:46.660 --> 01:36:49.520]
Yeah that aroma might put her in a coma.

[01:36:49.920 --> 01:36:53.520]
And of course Bush and the Congress would have to intervene.

[01:36:53.660 --> 01:36:55.220]
Yeah Bush would have to come back to Florida.

[01:36:55.720 --> 01:36:57.400]
That's right just like with Terry Shival.

[01:36:59.800 --> 01:37:01.500]
Important things forget about it.

[01:37:01.860 --> 01:37:05.320]
Just like we had to think with few more American soldiers who did today in Baghdad.

[01:37:05.660 --> 01:37:09.160]
And they gave about two seconds on that if you were if you like we're looked away for a second

[01:37:09.160 --> 01:37:12.460]
you wouldn't even see the story don't we go on to the dead whale or whatever that was.

[01:37:12.640 --> 01:37:16.080]
The shark the whale whatever it is a whale of an animal.

[01:37:17.120 --> 01:37:21.220]
Why are we so whipped up about freaking whales for Christ's and about sharks and about

[01:37:21.220 --> 01:37:25.160]
the manatees now well what's the big deal with that well they're in danger.

[01:37:26.280 --> 01:37:29.660]
Yeah and and so our American soldiers have he asked me.

[01:37:38.460 --> 01:37:38.860]
Yeah.

[01:37:40.620 --> 01:37:41.860]
Yeah.

[01:37:44.640 --> 01:37:44.640]

[01:37:45.380 --> 01:37:46.620]
Yeah.

[01:37:47.580 --> 01:37:48.740]
Yeah.

[01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:51.000]

[01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:51.000]

[01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:51.000]

[01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:51.000]

[01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:51.000]

[01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:51.000]

[01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:51.000]

[01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:51.000]

[01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:51.000]

[01:37:51.240 --> 01:37:51.240]

[01:37:51.240 --> 01:37:51.240]

[01:37:51.240 --> 01:37:51.240]

[01:37:51.240 --> 01:37:51.520]
Yeah.

[01:37:52.980 --> 01:37:53.160]
Yeah.

[01:37:53.400 --> 01:37:53.600]
Yeah.

[01:37:55.140 --> 01:37:55.800]
Yeah.

[01:37:56.200 --> 01:37:56.420]
Yeah.

[01:37:56.580 --> 01:37:57.200]
Yeah.

[01:37:57.400 --> 01:37:58.200]
Yeah.

[01:37:59.860 --> 01:38:00.200]
Yeah.

[01:38:00.300 --> 01:38:00.420]
Yeah.

[01:38:00.540 --> 01:38:01.500]
Yeah.

[01:38:02.260 --> 01:38:02.460]
Yeah.

[01:38:03.860 --> 01:38:04.060]
Yeah.

[01:38:05.380 --> 01:38:05.600]
Yeah.

[01:38:31.180 --> 01:38:34.380]
So, scary.

[01:38:34.400 --> 01:38:35.560]
I threw the box.

[01:38:35.560 --> 01:38:35.580]
So, I tried, was, I tried.

[01:38:35.580 --> 01:38:35.580]

[01:38:52.860 --> 01:39:00.120]
As the third,

[01:39:00.120 --> 01:39:00.800]
what does it mean?

[01:39:01.600 --> 01:39:01.780]
No.

[01:39:02.700 --> 01:39:05.140]
Jalice is with an IE on the end, by the way, not a Y.

[01:39:06.700 --> 01:39:10.540]
Jalice is an old Frankie Lane song, there's something like that, but you don't have it.

[01:39:10.960 --> 01:39:11.080]
No.

[01:39:11.620 --> 01:39:11.840]
Good.

[01:39:12.020 --> 01:39:13.520]
I love the jealousy song, it's been not that long.

[01:39:14.540 --> 01:39:15.060]
You do?

[01:39:16.680 --> 01:39:20.100]
Such as Natalie Merchant, Jalice.

[01:39:22.440 --> 01:39:26.000]
Can Brothers be called West End Girl, Jalice?

[01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:26.840]
No.

[01:39:28.640 --> 01:39:30.060]
No, none of them are the right songs.

[01:39:30.440 --> 01:39:30.540]
No.

[01:39:34.260 --> 01:39:35.320]
How about Jalice?

[01:39:35.480 --> 01:39:36.920]
You have any songs called Jalice?

[01:39:37.980 --> 01:39:38.420]
Jalice?

[01:39:38.600 --> 01:39:39.400]
Would be surprised.

[01:39:42.240 --> 01:39:42.680]
Jalice?

[01:39:43.140 --> 01:39:43.140]

[01:39:43.960 --> 01:39:44.400]
Jalice.

[01:39:44.400 --> 01:39:46.100]
Literally, Jalice from Old French.

[01:39:47.400 --> 01:39:49.700]
So there was nothing wrong with my singing Jalice when it was?

[01:39:49.840 --> 01:39:50.520]
Except that it's wrong.

[01:39:51.360 --> 01:39:52.820]
No, that's not correct.

[01:39:52.820 --> 01:39:54.320]
Yes, it's been what?

[01:39:54.520 --> 01:39:55.840]
The point of view is Jalice.

[01:39:55.860 --> 01:39:58.080]
If you can't emphasize the word, it's jealousy.

[01:39:58.460 --> 01:39:58.600]
Okay.

[01:39:58.860 --> 01:40:00.620]
If you've anglicized the word, it doesn't have what they're called.

[01:40:01.140 --> 01:40:02.440]
Anglicized, you're anglicized.

[01:40:02.440 --> 01:40:02.440]

[01:40:02.820 --> 01:40:02.840]
You're anglicized.

[01:40:02.840 --> 01:40:02.880]
You're anglicized.

[01:40:02.960 --> 01:40:03.380]
You're anglicized.

[01:40:03.640 --> 01:40:04.780]
You're anglicized.

[01:40:04.780 --> 01:40:06.080]
It's called that's right.

[01:40:06.340 --> 01:40:06.560]
That's right.

[01:40:07.500 --> 01:40:08.620]
So just cut the crap.

[01:40:09.640 --> 01:40:13.620]
Fueled by disappointment at the pace of change since Democrats assumed the majority on Capitol Hill,

[01:40:14.080 --> 01:40:17.580]
public approval of Congress has fallen to its lowest level and more than a decade, according

[01:40:17.580 --> 01:40:20.220]
to the latest LA Times Bloomberg poll.

[01:40:21.700 --> 01:40:25.820]
Just 27% of Americans now prove that the way Congress is doing its job, the poll found,

[01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:29.900]
down from 36% in January, dropped it like a rock and that's because there are bunch of

[01:40:29.900 --> 01:40:30.220]
whims.

[01:40:30.940 --> 01:40:33.600]
There are bunch of weak need pansies is what they are.

[01:40:35.560 --> 01:40:40.360]
63% of Americans say that the new Democratic Congress is governing in a business as usual

[01:40:40.360 --> 01:40:44.260]
manner rather than working to bring about the fundamental change that party leaders promised

[01:40:44.260 --> 01:40:45.900]
after November's midterm election.

[01:40:46.240 --> 01:40:46.900]
Key finding.

[01:40:48.100 --> 01:40:52.260]
A third of Liberal Democrats who constitute the party's base approve of the job Congress is

[01:40:52.260 --> 01:40:54.080]
doing 58% disapproved.

[01:40:54.280 --> 01:40:56.140]
33% say, yeah, good job.

[01:40:56.460 --> 01:40:59.120]
58% say, hey guys, use socket.

[01:40:59.920 --> 01:41:00.600]
How do you like that?

[01:41:01.940 --> 01:41:03.300]
Not good, not happy, man.

[01:41:04.540 --> 01:41:06.660]
And that's politics, I got told you it's a one party system.

[01:41:07.340 --> 01:41:09.140]
You got the worst, you know, you got different wings.

[01:41:09.340 --> 01:41:11.940]
There's the left wing and the right wing and the chicken wing.

[01:41:12.760 --> 01:41:14.960]
Is there going to be a chicken that is coming in today or what?

[01:41:15.200 --> 01:41:16.420]
I'm going to go see him somewhere.

[01:41:17.060 --> 01:41:18.600]
You're going to have a climb this and meeting with chicken?

[01:41:18.840 --> 01:41:19.340]
That's right.

[01:41:20.380 --> 01:41:22.820]
Well, don't do it at that restaurant that I ate at the week ago Saturday.

[01:41:23.020 --> 01:41:25.120]
No, no, no, we'll do it where we're going to eat.

[01:41:25.120 --> 01:41:28.280]
If you do do that, don't get that cowboy steak, man.

[01:41:28.360 --> 01:41:30.660]
I'm telling you, it's the rum cut from their ass mounting.

[01:41:30.940 --> 01:41:31.540]
It's the rough cut?

[01:41:32.080 --> 01:41:32.980]
Yeah, the rum cut.

[01:41:33.820 --> 01:41:34.780]
Oh, brother.

[01:41:35.600 --> 01:41:39.260]
Talk about a major disappointment and after the big buildup I got, oh, yeah.

[01:41:40.680 --> 01:41:42.140]
But it's the way it goes, you know.

[01:41:43.240 --> 01:41:45.560]
Now this could be a phone call and I was a time pain.

[01:41:45.700 --> 01:41:47.600]
But if it was a phone call, I just get up and walk out.

[01:41:49.800 --> 01:41:56.100]
Well, that's the new deal, if I get any like even a minor interruption like, you know, like if I have to fart or something we allow.

[01:41:56.540 --> 01:42:01.640]
I just go out of the room and let you bitch about David Watt's name for a half an hour.

[01:42:01.860 --> 01:42:02.040]
Chase.

[01:42:02.520 --> 01:42:04.000]
Chase and chase him down the road.

[01:42:04.260 --> 01:42:04.500]
Yeah.

[01:42:05.400 --> 01:42:06.380]
Chase's ass, okay?

[01:42:07.080 --> 01:42:08.940]
Now, who's the one that sent me that thing this morning?

[01:42:09.020 --> 01:42:12.200]
Oh, it was that pseudo intellectual, uh, then I deleted it right away.

[01:42:12.300 --> 01:42:13.180]
Quit bugging me, Jerry.

[01:42:14.020 --> 01:42:15.040]
The Abullian guy.

[01:42:15.160 --> 01:42:16.580]
Well, no, Martin's for a sense.

[01:42:16.580 --> 01:42:18.400]
And he says he's another one.

[01:42:18.740 --> 01:42:21.160]
Yeah, another pseudo would make a good movie in 25 years.

[01:42:21.180 --> 01:42:24.560]
All the suits hang together just like Jerry, the Abullian guy, you're a sued man.

[01:42:24.720 --> 01:42:25.760]
Get the get out of my face.

[01:42:25.980 --> 01:42:26.360]
Go away.

[01:42:28.460 --> 01:42:31.540]
Anyway, secret UN report condemns US for Middle East failures.

[01:42:31.800 --> 01:42:33.520]
Whoa, that must be a communist plot.

[01:42:34.420 --> 01:42:38.540]
The highest ranking UN official in Israel is one that American pressure is pummeled in the submission.

[01:42:39.140 --> 01:42:43.340]
The UN's role is an impartial Middle East negotiator in a damning confidential report.

[01:42:43.900 --> 01:42:47.220]
Damning report, not just a negative report, but a damning report.

[01:42:47.360 --> 01:42:49.220]
You know what the first thing that was that it said in the report?

[01:42:49.540 --> 01:42:50.140]
Let me tell you what it was.

[01:42:51.540 --> 01:42:52.380]
Yeah, that's it.

[01:42:53.520 --> 01:42:59.660]
The 53 page end of mission report by Alvaro De Soto, the UN's Middle East envoy, obtained by the Guardian,

[01:43:00.600 --> 01:43:05.280]
presents a devastating encounter failed the diplomacy and condemns the sweeping book out of the Palestinian government.

[01:43:05.280 --> 01:43:09.260]
It stated May 5 this year, just before Mr. De Soto stepped down.

[01:43:10.020 --> 01:43:11.080]
You ever see a De Soto?

[01:43:11.800 --> 01:43:12.580]
I might have.

[01:43:13.120 --> 01:43:14.540]
They were pretty neat looking cars.

[01:43:14.800 --> 01:43:18.560]
They were made by Chrysler, plummet De Soto, Dodge.

[01:43:19.620 --> 01:43:20.620]
What was the car in Christine?

[01:43:20.900 --> 01:43:21.700]
What was that was it a Dodge?

[01:43:22.540 --> 01:43:22.960]
I think so.

[01:43:23.220 --> 01:43:23.820]
Book of Bridal, though.

[01:43:25.440 --> 01:43:26.500]
What do you mean by that?

[01:43:27.120 --> 01:43:28.180]
Because he knows about cars.

[01:43:29.200 --> 01:43:30.180]
I see.

[01:43:30.800 --> 01:43:31.600]
Especially old ones.

[01:43:32.040 --> 01:43:33.260]
Oh, like the candy can afford?

[01:43:34.220 --> 01:43:35.200]
No, not those.

[01:43:35.940 --> 01:43:43.720]
The revelations from inside the UN came after another day of escalating violence in Gaza when at least 26 Palestinians were killed after Hamas fighters launched a major assault.

[01:43:44.580 --> 01:43:50.920]
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, Mahmoud, head of the rival Fatah Group, warned he was facing an attempted coup.

[01:43:52.120 --> 01:43:57.580]
Mr. De Soto condemns his real first setting on achievable preconditions for talks and the Palestinians for their violence.

[01:43:57.580 --> 01:44:00.640]
Western-led peace negotiators have become largely irrelevant, he says.

[01:44:01.160 --> 01:44:07.180]
Mr. De Soto is a Peruvian diplomat who worked for the UN for 25 years in El Salvador, Cyprus, and Western Sahara.

[01:44:07.820 --> 01:44:18.360]
He says the international boycott of the Palestinians introduced after Hamas when the elections last year was at best extremely short-sighted and has had devastating consequences for the Palestinian people, those poor sluppers.

[01:44:19.220 --> 01:44:23.060]
Israel has adopted an essentially reject this rejection as stands for the Palestinians.

[01:44:23.060 --> 01:44:27.700]
He says the Quartet have been at least negotiators. The US, the EU, Russia, and the UN has become a side show.

[01:44:28.020 --> 01:44:30.180]
Remember I was screaming about that? That crept with the Quartet?

[01:44:30.580 --> 01:44:32.280]
The String Quartet.

[01:44:32.700 --> 01:44:35.580]
The Roadmap and the Quartet and about a beep, Fatah Boop, but about.

[01:44:36.640 --> 01:44:41.700]
And he says the Palestinian record of stopping violence against Israel is patchy at best, reprehensible at worst.

[01:44:42.640 --> 01:44:45.300]
Mr. De Soto acknowledges in the report that he is the sole author.

[01:44:45.360 --> 01:44:51.520]
It's meant only for senior UN officials and it's wording is far more critical than the public pronouncements of UN diplomats because I guess they want to stay alive.

[01:44:52.500 --> 01:45:01.400]
In January last year the Quartet called on the newly elected Hamas government to commit to nonviolence, recognizes really except previous agreements when Hamas refused to sign up for the principles.

[01:45:01.760 --> 01:45:07.860]
The international community halted direct funding the Palestinian government and Israel started to freeze the monthly tax revenues, it agreed to pass to the Palestinians.

[01:45:08.320 --> 01:45:13.580]
Several hundred million dollars remain frozen and then probably in Jefferson's freezer in Louisiana.

[01:45:14.340 --> 01:45:18.780]
If there's any frozen funds baby, check in his freezer right away. He says he was set up by the FBI.

[01:45:19.900 --> 01:45:25.440]
And of course you know damn well he's going to turn into a racial thing and then El Sharpen is going to come to his aid right away in Jesse Jackson.

[01:45:25.560 --> 01:45:27.380]
It's going to be a big racial thing you know that.

[01:45:28.400 --> 01:45:32.940]
And then Kim Bocapro will go on the year and he'll say I said, but a beep, but a boop this and I said that yeah.

[01:45:33.740 --> 01:45:36.920]
And I said yeah sure, likely story you dumb jock.

[01:45:37.340 --> 01:46:02.700]
Frank and Melbourne says time for a year to listen, listen, how do you spell Barbish? It's not Barbish and Barbish and Barbish and not Barbish and not Barbish and not Barbish and not Barbish and not Barbish and not Barbish and not Barbish and not Barbish and not Barbish and not Barbish and not Barbish and not Barbish and not Barbish and not Barbish and not Barbish and not Barbish and not Barbish and not Barbish and not Barbish and not Barbish and not Barbish and not Barbish and not Barbish and not Barbish and not Barbish and not Barbish and not Barbish and not Barbish and not Barbish and not Barbish and not Barbish and not Barbish and not Barbish and not Barbish and not Barbish and not Barbish and not Barbish and not Barbish and not Barbish and not Barbish and not Barbish and not Barbish and not Barbish and not Barbish and not Barbish and not Barbish and not Barbish and not

[01:46:10.980 --> 01:46:32.680]
Barbish and not Barbish and not Barbish and not Barbish and not Barbish and nor Barbish and not Barbish and not Barbish and not Barbish and not Barbish and not Barbish and not Barbish and not Barbish and not Barbish and not Barbish and not Barbish and not Barbish and not Barbish and not Barbish and not Barbish and not Barbish and not Barbish and not Barbish are you蒼 happy and happy?

[01:46:32.680 --> 01:46:35.780]
how the menu is different. There was no macaroni and cheese thank God, although

[01:46:35.780 --> 01:46:38.140]
no actually it was worse because then I got the stofers and had damn near

[01:46:38.140 --> 01:46:41.900]
kill me. Right. But if the KFC, I hear they got to Taco Bell KFC this

[01:46:41.900 --> 01:46:47.840]
particular one side by each. You know, the same same joint. Alright. And the KFC

[01:46:47.840 --> 01:46:50.720]
menu I looked here to see if on the sides they had the macaron cheese they did

[01:46:50.720 --> 01:46:55.660]
not. Huh. They did not have that. And the KFC didn't have the cinnamon sticks

[01:46:55.660 --> 01:46:59.800]
for dessert. I guess they, uh, not that I need any more sugar anymore. Right. No.

[01:46:59.800 --> 01:47:02.500]
No. In particular day, I guess they edit the menu when they combine them

[01:47:02.500 --> 01:47:07.420]
like that. And it said something in their real Canadian cheddar cheese on a

[01:47:07.420 --> 01:47:10.460]
man, but you don't got that where you are man. No, it sounds good. You don't

[01:47:10.460 --> 01:47:14.060]
got your real Canadian cheddar cheese right. Stick to the real Canadian

[01:47:14.060 --> 01:47:18.040]
cheddar. Yeah. As if that makes a difference. What does that mean from a

[01:47:18.040 --> 01:47:21.400]
Canadian cow? As it, well, yeah. I sure hope I wasn't one of them angry

[01:47:21.400 --> 01:47:31.680]
cow. The difference is it's not craft. Oh man. Only one thing they say of

[01:47:31.680 --> 01:47:38.480]
craft. Yeah, that's it. 9.62. This is how hard we go over a thousand and they

[01:47:38.480 --> 01:47:40.740]
will fear us. Then we'll be really dangerous.

[01:47:42.480 --> 01:47:47.800]
I just saw a big sign in the side of the road that set the price for

[01:47:47.800 --> 01:47:59.780]
gallant and full. All right. Oh, my God. I got it. That's you mean. That's as big as

[01:47:59.780 --> 01:48:06.200]
a whale and I can't believe the gas is four bucks. I got the hammer and the

[01:48:06.200 --> 01:48:11.080]
mileage is from me so only up some more of your gasoline money.

[01:48:11.100 --> 01:48:14.560]
Four bucks is a really high price.

[01:48:15.360 --> 01:48:26.120]
People can't believe that. Why you didn't

[01:48:26.220 --> 01:48:31.280]
screaming. Quarant and a crying. I may have the site because I can't afford

[01:48:31.280 --> 01:48:33.720]
buying for bucks. It's crazy.

[01:48:37.920 --> 01:48:47.300]
Everybody's having to pay it. Pay it. I'm not sure. Thanks again Mr. President for

[01:48:47.300 --> 01:48:51.780]
those low gas prices and then really strong American dollar. You piece of

[01:48:51.780 --> 01:48:57.160]
you and I apologize to all the turret in the world for having said that. Putting

[01:48:57.160 --> 01:49:01.300]
you in the same category with W. 991 votes on the pool before the segment ends

[01:49:01.300 --> 01:49:04.440]
Chris we're gonna have a thousand votes and then it's just you know and they'll

[01:49:04.440 --> 01:49:08.780]
still have downhill from there. It's like whirling a stone downhill. No jealousy

[01:49:08.780 --> 01:49:12.720]
involved. With his resolution calling for the author of Dick Cheney,

[01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:16.180]

[01:49:38.780 --> 01:49:43.500]

[01:49:43.500 --> 01:49:48.380]
showing a bunch of ragheads in the Middle East. 15 state democratic parties and

[01:49:48.380 --> 01:49:52.100]
11 state legislatures have passed resolutions calling for Bush or Cheney to be

[01:49:52.100 --> 01:49:55.760]
impeached according to pro impeachment website after Downing Street dot org.

[01:49:56.860 --> 01:50:00.400]
Waters' edition's co-sponsor Kitsonage's measure comes after she voiced

[01:50:03.880 --> 01:50:08.000]
Bush and Cheney since the least of summer 2005 after Downing Street be

[01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:12.120]

[01:51:56.500 --> 01:51:58.980]
sudden while I wasn't looking, all these people on their lunch break looking to

[01:51:58.980 --> 01:52:05.220]
pick on me. Oh, guess what? Too bad. Let me ask you if you think on the 10th and

[01:52:05.220 --> 01:52:09.500]
the 25th of each month they've really bothered me. I know you weep you weep. Oh, I

[01:52:09.500 --> 01:52:14.300]
weep. Why do I weep? Because these people are idiots. Actors 69. Lawyers 59.

[01:52:14.800 --> 01:52:19.180]
Realtors 47. Stockbrookers 16 and rock stars. Solomentade.

[01:52:45.200 --> 01:52:51.020]
writing. And the next thing they're going to want me to spell it. One thing about

[01:52:51.020 --> 01:52:54.240]
you this you know you just you said to use common sense and no matter what you

[01:52:54.240 --> 01:52:56.280]
make up it doesn't make any difference anywhere because it's not a real

[01:52:56.280 --> 01:52:59.900]
language. I know there would be those linguists out there without no there's

[01:52:59.900 --> 01:53:03.260]
such a language. There's like a unistic scenario about yeah okay whatever you say

[01:53:03.260 --> 01:53:07.860]
okay probably AB I would be surprised if AB Solomon started the Yiddish

[01:53:07.860 --> 01:53:12.500]
language. What would you think? By that somebody else on the Solomon. I bet she did speak Yiddish.

[01:53:13.700 --> 01:53:17.340]
I mean my grandmother she was only in the country for 175 years and she still

[01:53:17.340 --> 01:53:21.600]

panic soldiers see there you go again pick it on your people in a letter of

Thursday Brigadier General Rodney Johnson apologized for the man in which

[01:55:31.780 --> 01:55:35.140]
this investigation was conducted and lots of trust that's resulted I wonder if

[01:55:35.140 --> 01:55:40.200]
they were looking for tattoos on their Johnson Johnson provost Marshall General of

[01:55:40.200 --> 01:55:42.620]
the Army and commander of the Army's criminal investigation command

[01:55:42.620 --> 01:55:46.080]
said he knew the investigation has been gravely mishandled when he read in

[01:55:46.080 --> 01:55:50.060]
newspaper that the May 2006 search led one task force member to say he didn't

[01:55:50.060 --> 01:55:54.380]
feel like an American today although the search was lawful it's also critical

[01:55:54.380 --> 01:55:57.540]
of my agents ensure that all soldiers are treated appropriately respectfully he

[01:55:57.540 --> 01:56:00.900]
said I sincerely regret we fail to do so in this case and want to assure you

[01:56:00.900 --> 01:56:05.800]
we've learned from this experience right Sergeant first class Frank Ramirez

[01:56:05.800 --> 01:56:09.520]
member of the task force cober said the apology was appropriate and welcome the

[01:56:09.520 --> 01:56:13.200]
Albuquerque Jürgen a journal reported Tuesday the Jürgen Albuquerque

[01:56:13.200 --> 01:56:16.700]
journal I'm proud to be part of an organization that can do that that could

[01:56:16.700 --> 01:56:19.420]
have swept it out of the rugged let it go said Ramirez a National Guard member

[01:56:19.420 --> 01:56:23.180]
for North 19 years the search was prompted by an unsubstantiated

[01:56:23.180 --> 01:56:26.760]
allegation of a soldier another unit who complained about gang activity among

[01:56:26.760 --> 01:56:29.980]
soldiers and Kuwait an army investigation conducted shortly after the tattoo

[01:56:29.980 --> 01:56:33.180]
checked and fooded the search was lawful and authorized and that a special

[01:56:33.180 --> 01:56:36.080]
agent of the criminal investigation command acted appropriately and internally

[01:56:36.080 --> 01:56:41.000]
quarried by the command also cleared the agent of wrongdoing however Montoya

[01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.960]
said in June one letter to general Peter schoolmaker in the office of the army

[01:56:43.960 --> 01:56:47.260]
chief is that that the unit was racially targeted and illegally searched for

[01:56:47.260 --> 01:56:50.860]
body tattoos just because the unit consisted of a large number of Hispanic

[01:56:50.860 --> 01:56:55.560]
surname soldiers how do you like that a ticket on your people probably next

[01:56:55.560 --> 01:57:00.600]

[01:57:00.600 --> 01:57:05.640]
hate tattoos man oh I was telling somebody just the other day it's just drives

[01:57:05.640 --> 01:57:09.900]
me up the wall I don't mind if only people get tattoos you know come what

[01:57:09.900 --> 01:57:12.800]
differences maybe that's why I got maybe it maybe it kind of distracts

[01:57:12.800 --> 01:57:17.040]
everybody else from their ugliness for looking people get tattoos and you know

[01:57:17.040 --> 01:57:20.260]
and nature has given in this this you know they didn't do anything to be

[01:57:20.260 --> 01:57:24.380]
beautiful I mean nature just had good genes you know and they were lucky enough

[01:57:24.380 --> 01:57:27.460]
to be born good looking and they just figured themselves with all the

[01:57:27.460 --> 01:57:30.140]
smuts in these tattoos and I want to say fast

[02:00:43.780 --> 02:00:47.380]
We got a full 103, man, like WBZ in Boston.

[02:00:47.580 --> 02:00:49.300]
Well, one of the great stations of all time,

[02:00:49.440 --> 02:00:50.760]
Radio 103, WBZ.

[02:00:51.520 --> 02:00:53.200]
How come every time I look at that pool number,

[02:00:53.360 --> 02:00:55.520]
it relates to, and that's because I used to be in radio.

[02:00:56.360 --> 02:00:56.880]
Yeah, me too.

[02:00:57.580 --> 02:00:58.560]
Many long years.

[02:00:58.620 --> 02:00:58.900]
I remember.

[02:00:59.520 --> 02:01:00.380]
Remember those days?

[02:01:00.700 --> 02:01:00.980]
Sure do.

[02:01:02.280 --> 02:01:04.600]
But that's in the past, you know, you can't live in the past.

[02:01:05.500 --> 02:01:06.420]
1,030 votes.

[02:01:06.540 --> 02:01:07.900]
We got Mad Dog coming up at 2 o'clock,

[02:01:08.160 --> 02:01:09.160]
hopper and a Mad Dog together.

[02:01:09.500 --> 02:01:11.400]
This week is almost like a real schedule, you know?

[02:01:13.780 --> 02:01:14.360]
No, I don't know.

[02:01:14.620 --> 02:01:16.660]
Man, man, man, man, which is on a radio.

[02:01:16.760 --> 02:01:18.500]
And spread the fact he hasn't gotten paid in two months.

[02:01:18.540 --> 02:01:19.740]
Has the nine, did you check around

[02:01:19.740 --> 02:01:20.500]
or voting is that true?

[02:01:20.600 --> 02:01:21.500]
Or is that just not really rumor?

[02:01:22.080 --> 02:01:22.700]
No, it's true.

[02:01:23.060 --> 02:01:25.120]
I was talking to Curtis, and actually it's been since,

[02:01:25.480 --> 02:01:26.580]
sometime in March, not April.

[02:01:27.800 --> 02:01:28.120]
March.

[02:01:29.660 --> 02:01:31.700]
April, May, junio.

[02:01:31.880 --> 02:01:33.900]
That's like, at least two and a half months,

[02:01:34.060 --> 02:01:35.320]
maybe three, depending on when in March.

[02:01:38.560 --> 02:01:41.100]
Now, I thought that the X-Jocks we got on the radio,

[02:01:41.240 --> 02:01:43.080]
and as much respect as I have for Jimmy Manwich,

[02:01:43.080 --> 02:01:45.420]
I just, I wonder why a macho guy like him

[02:01:45.420 --> 02:01:46.860]
would continue putting up with that crap.

[02:01:48.500 --> 02:01:51.960]
I mean, if I'm him, I go in a jolly Joe Bell's office

[02:01:51.960 --> 02:01:53.400]
and I start pounding on the desk,

[02:01:53.720 --> 02:01:55.820]
and I just, I start kicking the desk, you know what I'm saying?

[02:01:58.840 --> 02:01:59.800]
Am I right?

[02:02:00.340 --> 02:02:00.440]
Yeah.

[02:02:00.900 --> 02:02:03.080]
Where is my, of course, Crowded then, Crowded,

[02:02:03.080 --> 02:02:04.860]
but then again, Manwich ain't no Crow, you know?

[02:02:05.440 --> 02:02:06.760]
Manwich is like a real broadcaster,

[02:02:06.820 --> 02:02:07.520]
he's got a real audience,

[02:02:07.660 --> 02:02:09.460]
and got real numbers, and is really entertaining,

[02:02:09.460 --> 02:02:11.100]
and can speak the language, and things like that.

[02:02:11.100 --> 02:02:12.820]
As opposed to the Crow, he's now a wrestler.

[02:02:15.380 --> 02:02:17.260]
I bet you he's not the only wrestler

[02:02:17.260 --> 02:02:19.560]
that Bades and Kazmir are okay, I bet you that,

[02:02:19.660 --> 02:02:22.000]
because most of the wrestlers I hear are, you know, like that.

[02:02:22.280 --> 02:02:22.960]
Not the Crow though,

[02:02:24.840 --> 02:02:26.740]
as the Crowfly, so he's over in Japan.

[02:02:27.760 --> 02:02:30.480]
Maybe he's hanging out with that 17 year old guy,

[02:02:30.560 --> 02:02:32.220]
she ought to be 18 by now, I would think, huh?

[02:02:32.800 --> 02:02:33.420]
They're saying that student.

[02:02:34.300 --> 02:02:35.000]
Oh, at least, yeah.

[02:02:35.520 --> 02:02:36.200]
Well, there you go.

[02:02:37.660 --> 02:02:39.280]
After the IDATA mining program,

[02:02:39.320 --> 02:02:40.780]
Razor's eyebrows in Congress.

[02:02:42.100 --> 02:02:43.780]
Too bad Andy Ruiz not in Congress,

[02:02:43.780 --> 02:02:45.040]
can you imagine raising those eyebrows?

[02:02:45.860 --> 02:02:47.620]
Take a foreflip to do it.

[02:02:49.440 --> 02:02:50.300]
You know, one thing about me,

[02:02:50.860 --> 02:02:52.620]
I'm really nervous about my eyebrows,

[02:02:52.980 --> 02:02:54.280]
and they don't really look good.

[02:02:54.960 --> 02:02:55.920]
What are you nervous about?

[02:02:56.700 --> 02:02:58.300]
Well, because they don't go to the barber anymore.

[02:02:58.480 --> 02:02:59.860]
I mean, when you go to a barber to get a haircut,

[02:03:00.080 --> 02:03:01.740]
they trim your eyebrows, and they worry about it.

[02:03:02.200 --> 02:03:04.280]
But now that I cut, do my own hair, you know,

[02:03:04.340 --> 02:03:05.060]
with the Razor?

[02:03:05.060 --> 02:03:06.040]
Right, but don't they,

[02:03:06.900 --> 02:03:08.900]
don't you have like one of those trimmers like an old guy?

[02:03:08.900 --> 02:03:09.180]
No, I do.

[02:03:09.300 --> 02:03:10.720]
Oh, okay, well, that's it.

[02:03:10.800 --> 02:03:12.220]
But I have a comb, I see.

[02:03:12.660 --> 02:03:13.500]
You see how it works?

[02:03:13.600 --> 02:03:15.240]
Right, just comb it out and snip the ends.

[02:03:15.800 --> 02:03:16.720]
Yeah, no problem.

[02:03:18.020 --> 02:03:19.460]
Is that okay to send your approval?

[02:03:20.340 --> 02:03:20.340]

[02:03:20.660 --> 02:03:21.760]
Oh, by the way, thanks to Bobby,

[02:03:21.760 --> 02:03:24.780]
who, on my space, 58 plummet theory was the current Christine.

[02:03:25.020 --> 02:03:26.120]
I know it was some kind of a dodge.

[02:03:26.300 --> 02:03:26.580]
That's right.

[02:03:27.540 --> 02:03:28.960]
58 plummet theory, that's a good movie,

[02:03:29.080 --> 02:03:30.140]
and John Stockwell was in it,

[02:03:30.240 --> 02:03:31.200]
and one scene, Dan near naked.

[02:03:31.400 --> 02:03:32.400]
Oh, but anyway.

[02:03:34.460 --> 02:03:35.940]
How, what year was that, Christine?

[02:03:36.100 --> 02:03:36.720]
That's an old movie.

[02:03:36.860 --> 02:03:39.600]
I would say, I wanna say 7 to 4 or 8,

[02:03:39.780 --> 02:03:40.360]
It's 8 to 8 something.

[02:03:40.840 --> 02:03:41.480]
Was it eighties something?

[02:03:41.820 --> 02:03:41.820]

[02:03:42.160 --> 02:03:42.900]
Come and Google it.

[02:03:43.200 --> 02:03:43.420]
All right.

[02:03:51.880 --> 02:03:53.080]
I'm Googling over here,

[02:03:53.560 --> 02:03:54.460]
Christine, 83.

[02:03:55.400 --> 02:03:56.000]
You're right.

[02:03:57.820 --> 02:04:01.080]
And what's that goofy kid that was also in dress to kill,

[02:04:01.080 --> 02:04:04.840]
He played Angie Diffinson's son in Driftick Hill goofy with the glasses

[02:04:05.540 --> 02:04:10.340]
Well, that's a John Carburner movie by the way, right. I never knew that to this moment written by Stephen King

[02:04:10.340 --> 02:04:14.080]
Uh-huh. I never knew that. That was one of the few

[02:04:14.080 --> 02:04:17.720]
He's the he was the Arnie key to everything. He's all right

[02:04:18.620 --> 02:04:23.580]
Yeah, and his own goofy way and John Stockwell played Dennis is good the close personal buddy

[02:04:23.580 --> 02:04:30.120]
And there's no picture of John Stockwell on this thing you people are the wherever this the website is IMDB shame on you

[02:04:32.600 --> 02:04:36.220]
There's a picture of Alexandra Paul. Yeah, she's cute

[02:04:37.400 --> 02:04:40.360]
Flat but cute. Oh, she played the hooker, right?

[02:04:41.920 --> 02:04:42.960]
She was a hooker

[02:04:43.720 --> 02:04:48.280]
No, she was the witness. She was in the elevator. Alexander Paul was in Christine not dressed to kill

[02:04:50.280 --> 02:04:55.280]
Oh, excuse me. No, sorry. See I got my movies confused. That's all right. Well, it's just a little jealousy

[02:04:55.280 --> 02:04:59.900]
I understand can I get back to the story now if you must who am I thinking of I'm thinking of

[02:05:00.120 --> 02:05:10.080]
The she wasn't a hooker. Well, she was a hooker. That's the Allen. She was just leaving a little work and getting the elevator and she saw that the body in there

[02:05:11.700 --> 02:05:14.120]
And in the cop cabin to give kept giving her all that crap

[02:05:14.120 --> 02:05:18.640]
You know, he was so typical one of those typical TV type cops in England. He was really cheesy

[02:05:19.200 --> 02:05:24.900]
Whoever played the cop and dressed to kill am I right? Yep, the guy with a mustache. He was really a corn cornball cheesy

[02:05:25.400 --> 02:05:28.360]
The movie was good, but he was like an actor out of a grade Z

[02:05:28.860 --> 02:05:30.740]
sci-fi flicker something like that really

[02:05:32.280 --> 02:05:39.020]
Lawmakers are questioning whether they proposed F.E.I. anti-terrorist program is worth the price both in taxpayer dollars and the possible loss of Americans

[02:05:39.020 --> 02:05:40.640]
Privacy. Oh no

[02:05:41.340 --> 02:05:43.640]
We can't believe that could happen under this current regime

[02:05:44.480 --> 02:05:51.540]
The National Security Analysis Center, which would bring together nearly one and a half billion records created or collected by the FBI and other government agencies

[02:05:51.540 --> 02:05:54.980]
I figured the F.E.R. expects to quadruple in coming years according to unclassified

[02:05:54.980 --> 02:05:58.240]
FBI budget documented by the blotter on ABC news.com

[02:05:58.980 --> 02:06:01.920]
Those numbers alone raised concerns from two congressmen

[02:06:01.920 --> 02:06:06.820]
Representative is Brad Miller Democratic, California and James Sensenbrenner Republican of Wisconsin the chairman

[02:06:06.820 --> 02:06:10.280]
American member of the oversight panel of the House Science and Technology Committee

[02:06:10.820 --> 02:06:16.840]
The FBI has got a long track record of improperly even illegally gathering personal information on Americans

[02:06:16.840 --> 02:06:24.440]
Most recently through the widespread abuse of so-called national security letters the two may noted and elected congress's investigative body the GAO

[02:06:26.200 --> 02:06:31.040]
Miller and Sensenbrenner asked GAO to determine whether the NSA see will include records on US citizens

[02:06:31.040 --> 02:06:36.060]
And whether there are protections to make sure that all the data in the program was legally collected a

[02:06:36.660 --> 02:06:39.860]
Further concern to the two congressmen are the FBI stated hopes to

[02:06:39.860 --> 02:06:43.940]
Proactively mine the data to find terrorists using predictive analysis

[02:06:43.940 --> 02:06:49.580]
According to its budget request an unproven method of coronavirus was even the US intelligence office predictive

[02:06:50.540 --> 02:06:54.040]
It's just incredible. I think someday you're going to be a terrorist

[02:06:54.560 --> 02:06:57.640]
I'm predicting it. No, I'm looking to my crystal balls right now, man

[02:06:58.360 --> 02:07:03.120]
And I think you're gonna be a terrorist. I'm gonna tell that to my lesbianies caregiver when we're driving a woodbine today

[02:07:03.920 --> 02:07:06.980]
You terrorist you lesbian knees

[02:07:06.980 --> 02:07:10.420]
And like that. He's a good guy

[02:07:11.720 --> 02:07:14.020]
He means well, and I see more violence in Beirut

[02:07:14.020 --> 02:07:19.360]
He's gonna be hucking about that. Bup bup bup bup. I'd say you want to think if you know how if you knew how they hate George Bush here

[02:07:19.360 --> 02:07:25.240]
Then you'd have some idea of why America's in such held in such contempt around almost the entire globe these days

[02:07:26.180 --> 02:07:28.660]
Around the globe they hate him like poison

[02:07:29.580 --> 02:07:33.520]
But there's a picture of the Coliseo in Rome. What's that?

[02:07:33.620 --> 02:07:38.120]
Oh, what does it? It looked like in 320 AD when it was home to a million people

[02:07:39.520 --> 02:07:41.760]
Rome of the way they don't have that good food

[02:07:41.760 --> 02:07:46.540]
So this 3d recreation the brainchild of a group of international tech wizards

[02:07:46.540 --> 02:07:51.280]
We can and we do take people inside the Coliseum and even under the Coliseum

[02:07:51.280 --> 02:07:56.140]
You know, I need to find I think it would be interesting reading since you can Google this about anything in the world and learn a little bit

[02:07:56.140 --> 02:08:01.960]
Knowledge, I mean, it's wanting to say the Chinese and the Italians you know where the pioneers in pasta

[02:08:02.660 --> 02:08:07.240]
Right and we figure out that Marco Polo brought it back to Italy from China. That's the popular rumor

[02:08:07.920 --> 02:08:10.860]
But how did they learn to cook it?

[02:08:13.540 --> 02:08:16.640]
To boil it you know what I'm saying like everything I'm sure through experimentation

[02:08:18.700 --> 02:08:23.400]
But don't you see how and out of that it didn't say on the side of the box like cooking for seven or eight minutes?

[02:08:23.620 --> 02:08:25.800]
No, no how'd they figure any of this stuff out?

[02:08:26.580 --> 02:08:30.040]
Because they were smart and you know a lot like us like dumb they were smart. I'm afraid of

[02:08:40.960 --> 02:08:46.160]
Before it happens you get it here on news and six L.A.'s top news theme

[02:08:46.160 --> 02:08:54.020]
The hottest ticket law federal is right now isn't to a VIP party or an award. So it's to bomb markers last taping of the price is right

[02:08:54.020 --> 02:08:54.980]
What do you want to win?

[02:08:55.140 --> 02:08:59.100]
There's just something about the money man that makes him irresistible. What did you say?

[02:08:59.280 --> 02:09:04.320]
I said I want to kiss my dear that can be a cool look down here, please

[02:09:04.320 --> 02:09:07.840]
Doing and it's a pleasure to show you there

[02:09:10.860 --> 02:09:15.720]
Seize your eyes on that. Oh give it to me. Let's try it in the car. I love see

[02:09:15.720 --> 02:09:19.160]
Give it to me. The sofa and the jeep

[02:09:21.860 --> 02:09:29.720]
I'm feeling mighty good right now. He's retiring after 35 years and we hope that you've enjoyed your visit to the price

[02:09:29.720 --> 02:09:30.600]
Your life

[02:09:30.600 --> 02:09:33.480]
News and six at least new Steve

[02:09:35.140 --> 02:09:36.180]
Why show Friday?

[02:09:36.980 --> 02:09:40.540]
Well, it's a good thing you're on Friday nobody's gonna be watching now listen between loving and noon

[02:09:42.360 --> 02:09:45.200]
No, they're gonna be watching that NASCAR race with Kenny and Bo

[02:09:49.240 --> 02:09:52.740]
They are evil you know if there's just something that not Kenny. I don't think he's evil

[02:09:52.740 --> 02:09:57.540]
I just you know he just is what he is. What is that rock and roll talk host? Oh

[02:09:59.420 --> 02:10:04.080]
You said you want to take a leak next to him or something like that sure maybe more than once really

[02:10:04.080 --> 02:10:07.860]
And you do you guys can fagulate? Oh

[02:10:07.860 --> 02:10:09.800]
Yeah, we talked sports, you know

[02:10:12.280 --> 02:10:17.940]
All right, now I feel so much better. I feel better because I'm having a piece of cheese and you'll feel better

[02:10:17.940 --> 02:10:24.220]
No, it's not craft good. It's Salani very nice. Made in Schomburg, Ontario

[02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:28.100]
Salani sweet cheese. It's a Swiss shwites no carbs

[02:10:29.300 --> 02:10:32.480]
I'm gonna write a book called killer carbs if it's the last and thing I do

[02:10:33.220 --> 02:10:37.400]
I mean, I'm not a doctor will do it before you croak from killer carbs. Yeah

[02:10:39.240 --> 02:10:46.140]
I'm telling you man. It's bad stuff. Refine carbohydrates are the worst the most evil thing in the world and

[02:10:46.140 --> 02:10:49.160]
Nobody wants to talk about except Dr. Bob and he's dead

[02:10:50.480 --> 02:10:53.280]
Dr. Bob to you know something I wouldn't be surprised if it was a plot

[02:10:55.420 --> 02:10:57.080]
I would be surprised if it was

[02:10:57.080 --> 02:11:03.140]
The down was a plot. Yeah, somebody ice cream people like I stopped the street. You know, I know was the middle of the portion there

[02:11:03.140 --> 02:11:04.280]
Yeah, they probably

[02:11:05.320 --> 02:11:09.620]
Probably put a like a big fan big blow. Yeah, I had a long tube

[02:11:10.860 --> 02:11:16.640]
Had to be a plot because he was making a big comeback and then after he croakly all of a sudden after he died

[02:11:16.640 --> 02:11:20.800]
Oh, yeah, well, you know what this really works and it brings down your blood lipids and then you lose weight

[02:11:20.800 --> 02:11:25.600]
Yeah, even though you've been pooping it for years. This was you hated him. No, no

[02:11:25.600 --> 02:11:31.920]
He was personally a whole but he had a good a diet. Yeah, yeah, all of him was whole

[02:11:32.620 --> 02:11:36.160]
He was an egotistical bastard in person

[02:11:37.700 --> 02:11:39.660]
I think you're gonna look here either way. No

[02:11:39.660 --> 02:11:44.140]
I mean, I said right there with him for like always there with that person you were to witness

[02:11:44.140 --> 02:11:50.160]
He's holding him 700 weeks the grief is realizing those people at the book and get a copy of his newer book after that

[02:11:50.160 --> 02:11:54.780]
And he autographed for me and this is you know, and thanks for everything you do for us right well in the meantime

[02:11:54.780 --> 02:11:58.440]
He gave those people at the store hell because they wouldn't treat him a celebrity issue

[02:11:58.440 --> 02:12:04.120]
Nothing really. Oh, yeah, I want a microphone and I want to take questions and I want the things over here

[02:12:04.120 --> 02:12:06.280]
And they're trying to explain to him look we're gonna have a lot of people here

[02:12:06.280 --> 02:12:10.940]
We can't just have you doing this a personal seminar with all these people. We got a line out the door over here

[02:12:10.940 --> 02:12:14.620]
Well, I was pitching a fit with those people maybe you want to cry

[02:12:16.240 --> 02:12:18.100]
You never told me this I

[02:12:19.060 --> 02:12:22.640]
Think you just told you that I told you that I wanted you to want to hear it because he was your best buddy

[02:12:23.100 --> 02:12:27.260]
He was my best buddy, Dr. Bob. He was a rude egotistical P word

[02:12:29.400 --> 02:12:29.720]
Rick

[02:12:32.720 --> 02:12:33.360]

1052 on Chris's pool

[02:12:42.100 --> 02:12:43.400]
You think you've been to 1100

[02:12:44.680 --> 02:12:45.000]
Yes

[02:12:46.100 --> 02:12:51.160]
If you could do a 100 I don't think so you got 55 minutes you'd have to get 48 votes. Yeah, I guess you could

[02:12:53.020 --> 02:12:55.220]
Or narrowly 1100 on the show is not like you know

[02:12:55.220 --> 02:12:56.520]
It's not stopped the press time

[02:12:56.520 --> 02:13:00.820]
But when we started with that very low total and maybe that's something to do with the fact they didn't like this pool

[02:13:00.820 --> 02:13:01.760]
I don't know why

[02:13:02.880 --> 02:13:05.760]
And look how nicely I moved up on a pool. I got 11% of votes

[02:13:06.160 --> 02:13:10.560]
Making too much money well too bad. I'm not giving any back. I

[02:13:10.560 --> 02:13:13.580]
Give plenty of way man. I take care of everybody. I take care of the whole universe

[02:13:16.200 --> 02:13:16.920]

Now this thing that you just passed to me my eyesight is very good. I can read it's microscopic

[02:13:29.520 --> 02:13:31.820]
I know if I can read this

[02:13:31.820 --> 02:13:36.580]
Speaking of birthdays for yours next year magna vision reading goggles my career is all pair

[02:13:37.880 --> 02:13:41.640]
Father George Cordova was arrested in Spain via the authority of

[02:13:41.640 --> 02:13:45.660]
Provisional arrest warrant. He is awaiting extradition back to the US

[02:13:46.940 --> 02:13:50.620]
Cordova was wanted for 10 accounts a sexual abuse in Yuma County and

[02:13:51.180 --> 02:13:56.160]
Investigation about the human police department. I was in diamond in Yuma County superior court August 30th 2005

[02:13:57.200 --> 02:13:59.620]

[02:14:00.880 --> 02:14:05.980]
Cordova's accused of sexually abusing two minors during his assignment to same Francis of this is the same story

[02:14:05.980 --> 02:14:08.380]
I had yesterday same Francis of a sissy

I'm gonna have this story

[02:14:11.520 --> 02:14:16.940]
So thank you very much to ever sent this in because obviously it's from one of our listeners, but I already had it on yesterday

[02:14:16.940 --> 02:14:22.980]
No, it's one thing to be doing these stories. I'm traveling. I think priest. Well, let's not pile on for crying out loud. They might enjoy it

[02:14:26.260 --> 02:14:26.740]
Oh

[02:14:26.740 --> 02:14:29.620]
This is the same guy that sends all these stories right this is a guy

[02:14:29.620 --> 02:14:33.900]
This is probably a guy that wasn't molested by the priest and was jealous or

[02:14:34.960 --> 02:14:40.280]
Wasn't it that was a certain amount of jealousy involved maybe he was molested wrong no a

[02:14:41.300 --> 02:14:45.460]
Priest from the diocese of rockhampton now where was that?

[02:14:48.400 --> 02:14:49.360]
Is that

[02:14:51.600 --> 02:14:52.000]
In

[02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:55.020]
Central Queensland is that Australia? I didn't already send you this

[02:14:55.020 --> 02:14:57.020]
Ex-Onihanta pre-story. Did I?

[02:14:57.800 --> 02:15:01.000]
No, all right good here come keep the pre-stories coming baby

[02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:07.100]
Okay, maybe some of the Catholics won't go to church on Sunday and keep putting the money in there so they can pay off the cover up all these sins

[02:15:09.020 --> 02:15:12.080]
Well, this cheese is pretty good no carbs by the way

[02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:17.660]
And that'll that'll keep that'll tie me over because I got a long afternoon of fighting the machines mine

[02:15:19.080 --> 02:15:23.660]
A priest from the diocese of rockhampton molested a brother and sister in the confessional and

[02:15:23.660 --> 02:15:28.020]
Behamed indecently with all two boys moments before conducting mass a court was told yesterday

[02:15:29.840 --> 02:15:31.980]
Michael Joseph McCartle 68

[02:15:33.180 --> 02:15:40.240]
Oh, yeah, this is Australia pleaded guilty in the district court in Brisbane to a trouble of 62 charges involving 60 56

[02:15:40.240 --> 02:15:46.100]
Council of the decent dealing in decent dealing against boys under age under 14. What does that mean in decent dealing?

[02:15:47.400 --> 02:15:49.800]
And six counts against girls age under 14

[02:15:50.740 --> 02:15:58.980]
McCartle molested 14 boys and two girls age between eight and 13 in parishes throughout Queensland between 1965 and 1987

[02:15:59.740 --> 02:16:05.160]
The centers involved were rockhampton while it goes on where they were but who the hell knows where those places are all over Australia

[02:16:05.160 --> 02:16:08.580]
Prosecutor Michael Burns had McCartle molested all her boys and girls in the

[02:16:09.520 --> 02:16:12.760]
Presbytery vestry the confessional and on church and school camps

[02:16:13.760 --> 02:16:17.720]
Mr. Burns said he had one boy masturbate him just ten minutes before celebrating mass

[02:16:19.700 --> 02:16:23.520]
It was through the authority of his office that he had access to the complainants and because of his

[02:16:23.520 --> 02:16:28.380]
Percept in the community of being a person of high moral standing that took many years for his offending to come to light

[02:16:28.380 --> 02:16:34.680]
Mr. Burns said he said missed he said McCartle victims came forward after publicity from interviews the priest gave to a journalist and

[02:16:34.680 --> 02:16:40.440]
Which he admitted some of the abuse and claim the children had just wanted it to some extent they wanted it. How do you like that?

[02:16:41.160 --> 02:16:42.360]
They wanted it

[02:16:43.020 --> 02:16:45.160]
I wanted it. He doesn't

[02:16:45.800 --> 02:16:48.560]
Not from him. They didn't want it, but they wanted it

[02:16:49.680 --> 02:16:52.600]
They didn't resist to some extent they wanted it Mr. McCartle

[02:16:52.600 --> 02:16:56.080]
Legitly said I'm not saying it was their fault just that they didn't object

[02:16:57.540 --> 02:17:03.140]
McCartle was ordained in 1962 and retired in 1988 but was still performing private prayer services in

[02:17:03.140 --> 02:17:04.580]
Butterberg until 2000

[02:17:05.840 --> 02:17:06.360]
Bungaburg

[02:17:07.300 --> 02:17:13.960]
He said he'd been confronted about molestation incidents three times during his priesthood the sentencing hearing before senior George Warren Howell is ongoing

[02:17:13.960 --> 02:17:16.280]
Fry his Catholic ass

[02:17:18.220 --> 02:17:20.160]

[02:17:21.760 --> 02:17:24.960]
Onionta while we know where onionta is man. It's in New York a

[02:17:26.100 --> 02:17:29.140]
Catholic pre-I think I had this story to you. I had this one yesterday, too

[02:17:29.140 --> 02:17:31.080]
Well, I just asked you about that. Yeah, but that was yesterday

[02:17:31.080 --> 02:17:36.080]
You're asking me like if you asked me to send it today. Well, the guy who's just you're asking me about yesterday

[02:17:37.480 --> 02:17:42.300]
This is yesterday. Yeah, I read these yesterday. This is from this ethier guy. All right

[02:17:42.300 --> 02:17:45.800]
You know how much I saw Columbia County. I said this looks awfully familiar

[02:17:45.800 --> 02:17:48.140]
You know, it's one thing for me to read these you know once

[02:17:48.820 --> 02:17:50.880]
But then you want to pile on it's like Roger

[02:17:50.880 --> 02:17:53.760]
You know, guys stuff fun and stuff twice the preacher guy

[02:17:54.260 --> 02:17:59.120]
The preacher guy the guy that hates these preachers these yeah, well and rightfully so by the way

[02:17:59.120 --> 02:18:02.400]
I have one thing to say it all these child molesting

[02:18:06.360 --> 02:18:11.960]
Admin is a two-sold American. Yeah, that's probably what they were saying well all this stuff was going on they liked it

[02:18:12.920 --> 02:18:14.300]
And they wanted it

[02:18:15.820 --> 02:18:20.520]
Isn't that always the excuse she wanted her just wanted it. Yeah, they enjoyed it that begged for it

[02:18:20.520 --> 02:18:24.580]
Yeah, I think it's friction and fiction

[02:18:25.240 --> 02:18:30.020]
I'll combine it in one lots of friction and lots of fiction. I think in a friction. There's Tony snow

[02:18:30.020 --> 02:18:34.800]
I believe took place after the personnel actually had taken place lying through his teeth

[02:18:35.940 --> 02:18:38.360]
Another fox news shielder at the White House

[02:18:39.700 --> 02:18:44.180]

He's sitting on a street corner somewhere in Ojas head and hands

[02:21:08.040 --> 02:21:10.220]
Maybe you suck Joel maybe that's the problem

[02:21:11.540 --> 02:21:14.740]
Maybe Joe Rose has got a good point maybe you aren't a whole Joel

[02:21:16.620 --> 02:21:18.220]
You're a wannabe

[02:21:19.780 --> 02:21:22.020]
See what I think about cheese is not good when you're on here

But I want to know why it's a milk product for them. He right right like ice cream

[02:21:27.400 --> 02:21:32.180]

Now especially when you're stealing their music anyway sure not paying for it right? That's why don't feel so bad

[02:22:10.920 --> 02:22:15.340]
They're rich, and yeah, that's right. They're making all the big bucks. It's a big and spirit

[02:22:16.620 --> 02:22:20.260]
The hell with them and that's why they're not paying for this show, you know

[02:22:22.920 --> 02:22:26.660]
This is really something that this is kind of scary and you know what it highlights to me

[02:22:26.660 --> 02:22:31.280]
It highlights the incredible mediocrity of the field at least for the Republicans anyway

[02:22:32.780 --> 02:22:38.840]
Fred Thompson is adding more big name policy tellers is testing the waters committee continues to grow into a real

[02:22:38.840 --> 02:22:40.860]
presidential campaign no

[02:22:41.640 --> 02:22:47.040]
Among the new editions mark Esper national security adviser to former Senate Majority Leader Bill Fist

[02:22:47.720 --> 02:22:56.280]
Joel Shen a top policy staffer on Bush Cheney 2000 and Elizabeth Cheney former top official in the State Department's Near East and South Asia Department

[02:22:57.900 --> 02:23:04.720]

Accord of biography of the US China Commission website

[02:23:18.180 --> 02:23:24.420]
Esper's portfolio in that position included all defense foreign policy and intelligence matters for the USA for the Senate

[02:23:25.240 --> 02:23:30.540]
Where he also worked on trade and homeland security issues he worked on executive legislative national security matters

[02:23:30.540 --> 02:23:34.660]
An important job given the Bush administration's posture on a robust executive branch

[02:23:35.920 --> 02:23:37.960]
Esper's current a1a aia

[02:23:37.960 --> 02:23:43.660]
It looks like a1a and when you're a Florida guy, you know, you know a1a sure

[02:23:44.340 --> 02:23:48.340]
Remember w aia a1a. Mm-hmm. Now we didn't later become the coast

[02:23:49.220 --> 02:23:54.340]
I'm not sure. I'm trying to think about it. I mean later it became what was there what you called on

[02:23:54.820 --> 02:23:56.140]
What do you call is a

[02:23:57.700 --> 02:23:58.140]
GTR

[02:23:58.660 --> 02:24:06.440]
Right 93 or 97 here and then it was the coast and now what is it still the coast? Yes. Oh, how sad

[02:24:07.640 --> 02:24:11.100]
Joel Joel Shinra about goes on about all these different people who they'll curious

[02:24:11.100 --> 02:24:15.080]
Esper Shin and Cheney were all well known and respected in the Washington foreign policy community in generally

[02:24:15.080 --> 02:24:22.480]
We got it as hawkish and their views on national security. They will continue to give Thompson's foreign policy advice as they ever becomes a formal campaign

[02:24:23.380 --> 02:24:29.760]
The informal group began meeting late last month and current plans are for weekly policy sessions like most campaign advisory groups

[02:24:29.760 --> 02:24:34.320]
The foreign policy team will hash out current foreign policy issues and make recommendations to the candidate

[02:24:35.120 --> 02:24:41.200]
It's members will also seek to anticipate the kinds of foreign policy and national security crises that might require answers from

[02:24:41.840 --> 02:24:42.240]
Thompson

[02:24:42.880 --> 02:24:45.680]
The actor the former senator the actor

[02:24:46.320 --> 02:24:51.580]
Mugwam he is his dull and just wooden he makes algorithms seem like a Mexican jumping bean

[02:24:52.620 --> 02:24:56.140]
That's how dull Fred Thompson is, but he hits jan or we know

[02:24:57.280 --> 02:25:02.400]
Just in case you forgot you got 1084 under full man. We didn't even have to work up a sweat to get to 1100

[02:25:03.940 --> 02:25:04.840]
What does that mean

[02:25:08.320 --> 02:25:14.180]
Well, what do you think that means it's a good sign I guess yeah, I beg your pardon. Yes

[02:25:15.100 --> 02:25:19.900]
See you say yes, George. Oh, you know you don't care. I don't care

[02:25:20.940 --> 02:25:24.180]
But you know something you're gonna start care when you have to put the polls on there almost

[02:25:24.180 --> 02:25:28.140]
Yeah, that makes me care more. I don't mind doing the news stories for you during the summer time

[02:25:28.140 --> 02:25:32.620]
I gave your ass out especially now that I know they're not paying you an extra dime. What kind of a deal was that that normal?

[02:25:32.780 --> 02:25:39.760]
God you hey, Norma you fairly easy Christ. I thought he was your friend. What made you think that? I don't know you're not his type. I know

[02:25:40.700 --> 02:25:43.940]
Or mine. I know at least I try to take you your

[02:25:43.940 --> 02:25:50.780]
So I was at Carthane coming by the way although I just mailed off the last thing to your accountant to pay the last payment on it

[02:25:52.800 --> 02:26:00.860]
What am I accountant your cop roller and the bill paying guy there yeah, and when I get the title in the mail

[02:26:00.860 --> 02:26:06.320]
I'm gonna go shopping with it and I'm gonna try to get a deal to minimize the impact on your life as usual

[02:26:08.180 --> 02:26:12.340]
To minimize the impact on my life so that you're not spending any more than you have to obviously

[02:26:12.340 --> 02:26:17.380]
Hey, listen, you know, I'm father of the universe anyway. I take care of everybody except ever the less never the less I get nothing

[02:26:18.400 --> 02:26:22.200]
And don't take that personal for as I can just only spread it around so thin all these people

[02:26:22.200 --> 02:26:25.820]
I think I make into much money if they knew how many people I was supporting you know right

[02:26:26.600 --> 02:26:29.060]
And what's wrong with that I like spreading it around I

[02:26:30.240 --> 02:26:31.140]
Like shmuring it around

[02:26:33.080 --> 02:26:33.800]
Ariana Huffington

[02:26:35.420 --> 02:26:38.460]
Democratic dinosaurs turned DC into the land of time for God

[02:26:39.200 --> 02:26:45.900]
That cheese just you know, it's not it doesn't affect my blood sugar because you know, it's got no carbs my blood sugar is actually going down

[02:26:46.580 --> 02:26:46.980]
but

[02:26:48.800 --> 02:26:54.240]
Nothing that happened yesterday between noon and one that was as close to an on death ex uh honor death experience

[02:26:55.040 --> 02:26:56.520]
With that damn macaroni and cheese

[02:26:56.520 --> 02:27:01.220]
So I better not embarking reading any of these long stories here because it would be a bad idea

[02:27:01.680 --> 02:27:02.080]
why

[02:27:03.020 --> 02:27:06.620]
Because I can't do it. I just I just I don't have the I can't you hear it

[02:27:07.260 --> 02:27:12.180]
A flood is the cheese baby cheese binding you up is binding up my throat

[02:27:13.820 --> 02:27:18.460]
I took care of the binding problem earlier when I was playing that reader book for the 400th time today

[02:27:18.460 --> 02:27:24.520]
Okay, I seize the opportunity because I I suddenly discovered that it was Joyce time some some people know when it's Miller time

[02:27:25.100 --> 02:27:28.620]
Right, I knew it was Joyce time then I went in there and I rejoiced

[02:27:29.440 --> 02:27:36.180]
Halle Luea and you know me I can do those kinds of things and just uh two shakes of a lamestail two shakes of my ass

[02:27:36.780 --> 02:27:37.640]
It's amazing

[02:27:38.640 --> 02:27:40.860]
But when you've been in this business so long, you know

[02:27:42.160 --> 02:27:44.500]
You have to develop that kind of talent

[02:27:45.200 --> 02:27:47.760]
It's always left it's always left people speechless

[02:27:48.260 --> 02:27:52.120]
Especially when like new board ops you know somebody in their first time and I go running down the hall

[02:27:52.120 --> 02:27:57.000]
Oh genius gonna be back before the break is over and I'm back with plenty of time to spare everything

[02:27:58.180 --> 02:28:03.140]
Oh, you can't done no serious business now. Let me tell you I did serious business

[02:28:04.380 --> 02:28:09.340]
Serious you know I mean by serious. Mm-hmm. I'm not talking about with an eye serious with an eye. Well, there is one eye

[02:28:10.860 --> 02:28:12.220]
It's a back home ground

[02:28:13.560 --> 02:28:18.280]
1090 on the pool by the bottom of the hour. We're gonna have 1100 then then it'll be on the front page of the hill

[02:28:18.280 --> 02:28:23.820]
There's that little a weasel Alberto v. O five Gonzalez and Tony Snow is talking more lies and more crack, you know

[02:28:25.060 --> 02:28:27.360]
I guess you know Paris Hilton's story is short

[02:28:28.540 --> 02:28:32.760]
Paris Hilton says she will no longer act dumb. I'm right. I see that's early on the show

[02:28:34.120 --> 02:28:38.820]
The reality TV star and relentless publicity speakers spoke with Barbara Walters by phone Sunday

[02:28:39.380 --> 02:28:44.300]
A day after releasing a statement saying she hoped the media would focus on more important things than her jail sentence

[02:28:45.020 --> 02:28:49.180]
I used to act dumb that act is no longer cute ABC quoted her a saying

[02:28:50.380 --> 02:28:52.960]
After spending three days in jail in a reckless driving case

[02:28:52.960 --> 02:28:58.320]
She was briefly released to home confinement, but we've been a boop at about she's now housed in a medical ward of a maximum security

[02:28:58.320 --> 02:29:01.040]
Detention center. Hopefully they'll keep her there forever

[02:29:02.360 --> 02:29:05.320]
According to ABC News the Colquing after Hilton's mother Kathy

[02:29:05.920 --> 02:29:06.780]
Tho-land Walters

[02:29:07.760 --> 02:29:11.680]
During the conversation the 26-year-old socialite called her mom on another line

[02:29:11.680 --> 02:29:15.020]
Found out that her mother was talking to Walters and then called Walters collect

[02:29:15.740 --> 02:29:18.320]
All JL inmates are required to call collect

[02:29:19.100 --> 02:29:25.140]
Hilton's been saying that she's charged changed by her jailhouse experience and she repeated the theme with Walters

[02:29:25.140 --> 02:29:30.360]
Now I would like to make a difference. She said God has given me this new chance. Oh

[02:29:31.040 --> 02:29:36.420]
Yeah, God help me man. Yeah, I'm gagging on it. Oh good

[02:29:40.480 --> 02:29:42.180]
The Middle Eastern world

[02:29:43.040 --> 02:29:52.660]
Will be exploded to dom at people killed with the gas that we sold him first time aggressor nation and they only one that's going

[02:29:52.660 --> 02:29:59.540]
Now more blood will be spilled to get that oil flowing forget about Korea and

[02:29:59.540 --> 02:30:08.620]
The nooks there toe to man the right wing is drilling it over and over into our head

[02:30:09.460 --> 02:30:15.000]
That iraq has some weapons of master's corruption

[02:30:19.880 --> 02:30:20.720]
Oh

[02:30:26.440 --> 02:30:34.200]
3000 people killed are now forgotten let's exploit them instead. Hey, there's oil to be counted

[02:30:34.200 --> 02:30:44.720]
Going after symptom to play kato sama. There's no longer mention of the name in lot and but no one seems concerned all

[02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:55.240]
Humphie and complacent believe in every word of this cartel administration that controls us by fear through media manipulation and

[02:30:55.800 --> 02:31:01.900]
Right wing is drilling it over and over and over to our head

[02:31:01.900 --> 02:31:08.280]
Oh, that iraq has some weapons of master's corruption

[02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:15.340]
Oh

[02:31:19.240 --> 02:31:29.100]
The loss of civil rights is the right that we're paying we're all suspects now not the ash crop is saying I have nothing to hide

[02:31:29.100 --> 02:31:35.220]
Table parkers all are saying blind obedient cattle don't have any reservation

[02:31:35.860 --> 02:31:38.980]
Out of provoked battle and world annihilation

[02:31:39.660 --> 02:31:45.700]
Old regime must fall in hallowed virgin and stoke with no objection at all

[02:31:45.700 --> 02:31:53.900]
Then the crap don't have the balls and the right wing is drilling it over and over and over

[02:31:53.900 --> 02:31:53.960]
Oh

[02:31:53.960 --> 02:31:57.920]
I rack has some

[02:31:58.500 --> 02:32:01.300]
Weapons of master's corruption

[02:32:04.260 --> 02:32:04.740]
Oh

[02:32:04.740 --> 02:32:05.940]
I rack has some

[02:32:06.920 --> 02:32:08.740]
Weapons of master's corruption

[02:32:10.020 --> 02:32:15.800]
Over that bomb squad we move devices at wing valley high school in for safety joys. Oh boy

[02:32:16.500 --> 02:32:18.520]
It's just a part of going to school every day now, right?

[02:32:19.080 --> 02:32:22.760]
Nobody with a gun anybody with an abamukarande or pecania or whatever

[02:32:22.760 --> 02:32:23.560]
133

[02:32:23.560 --> 02:32:26.060]
202 a qm I do have an article that you're like

[02:32:26.840 --> 02:32:28.080]
Yeah marine doubt

[02:32:28.640 --> 02:32:32.200]
Marine down the times today a tale of two tonis exiting tormented

[02:32:33.960 --> 02:32:36.220]
You don't think she riffs david chasing her do you?

[02:32:36.300 --> 02:32:37.760]
Let's hope maybe oh she does

[02:32:38.400 --> 02:32:43.900]
They're both going out not with a bang, but with a bing she says as they go dark the two tonis are bitter

[02:32:44.360 --> 02:32:47.500]
Paranoid and worn down by their enemies and scheming worst-while allies

[02:32:47.500 --> 02:32:51.540]
They both live in a bleak universe of half truth. By the way, we got 102 votes

[02:32:52.340 --> 02:32:57.360]
They both live in a bleak universe of half truth compromises and betrayals a world change a world change

[02:32:58.080 --> 02:33:02.420]
Utterly by the violence they said in motion. They were both brought low by high stakes mistakes

[02:33:03.120 --> 02:33:07.720]
Tony Blair fears the feral beast Tony soprano is the feral beast

[02:33:08.480 --> 02:33:14.720]
The two tonis found that their skin was never thick enough and they stumbled in a trouble with their juniors junior bush and junior soprano

[02:33:15.280 --> 02:33:20.840]
Before he steps down into weeks Tony Blair decided to lose one of those self-pitying Tony soprano style rants

[02:33:20.840 --> 02:33:25.480]
The drug doctor melfy determinate him call it number 10 downer downer street

[02:33:26.440 --> 02:33:32.740]
The fear of missing out it means today's media more than ever before hunts in a pack Mr. Blair said in a speech at Reuters in London

[02:33:33.560 --> 02:33:38.880]
In these modes, it's like a feral beast just tearing people in reputations to bits, but no one dares miss out

[02:33:39.660 --> 02:33:44.000]
The British Tony actually begins to speech reflections on the future of democracy in the media

[02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:49.940]
Or why don't you love me with the world whacking as in this is not my response to the latest whacking from bits of the media

[02:33:50.680 --> 02:33:53.980]
Of course it is at least partly talk about hoist on your own press

[02:33:54.700 --> 02:33:59.100]
When Tony Blair announced last month that he would step down the press that wants doated on him devoured him

[02:33:59.820 --> 02:34:06.080]
The commentary was a frenzied complaints about the slick Blair spin machine that manipulated the media and turned British discourse to rot

[02:34:06.900 --> 02:34:11.400]
The movie The Queen recounted the young prime minister's triumph when he helped spin Diana's

[02:34:11.400 --> 02:34:18.260]
Post-Mist Images the people's princess and controlled the high bound worlds into listening and responding to the feral press beast

[02:34:18.260 --> 02:34:20.540]
That was tearing the monarchy's reputation to bits

[02:34:21.240 --> 02:34:27.440]
But when the beast as Evelyn was slightly called his British newspaper in scoop turned on Mr. Blair over various scandals

[02:34:27.440 --> 02:34:33.360]
Most importantly is unholy allowance with W on Iraq. He grew to solution the lion tamer walled by his own lion

[02:34:34.600 --> 02:34:38.920]
The final consequence of all of this is that it's very today to find balance in the media Mr. Blair said

[02:34:38.920 --> 02:34:44.200]
Things people issues stories are all black and white. Life's usual a gray is almost entirely absent

[02:34:44.200 --> 02:34:49.900]
Some good some bad some things going right some going wrong. These are concepts aliens into today's reporting. He said

[02:34:51.360 --> 02:34:56.160]
Marine says I worry more about the press when it's reverent rather than irreverent when it's a tame lapdog

[02:34:56.160 --> 02:35:02.260]
As was in the build up to a rack than when it's a feral beast and I worry about politicians like W and Blair being black and white

[02:35:02.260 --> 02:35:06.500]
Rather than gray as if they were building their own hysterical phony case against Sodom

[02:35:07.180 --> 02:35:13.680]
We would have been well served back then if Mr. Blair had explained to the junior that there are some good some bad and some gray in the world and sometimes

[02:35:13.680 --> 02:35:17.020]
It's smarter to squeeze tyrants rather than shock and all them

[02:35:18.180 --> 02:35:24.480]
On his first visit to Baghdad Monday Gordon Brown vibe never to repeat his partner's mistake of politicizing intelligence to go to war

[02:35:25.020 --> 02:35:30.640]
We'll have to wait to see if David chase the garbo of Gumbas now pursued by the feral beast of disappointed

[02:35:30.640 --> 02:35:36.980]
His parents as feeding his paranoid and thin skin as the two Tony's as deeply surprised by the consequences of his actions

[02:35:37.920 --> 02:35:44.880]
Mr. Chase and apocalyptic tees gave us a gimmicky and unsatisfying film school style blackout for an end to his mob saga

[02:35:44.880 --> 02:35:48.180]
One stunt above a stunt one not so above it was all a dream

[02:35:48.980 --> 02:35:52.420]
It was the TV equivalent of one of those design your own mug places

[02:35:53.080 --> 02:35:57.620]
Even though I love the first few years of these sopranos Mr. Chase always struck me as passive aggressive

[02:35:57.620 --> 02:36:03.200]
The more fans obsessed on his show the longer his hiatuses would grow and the slower his narrative velocity move

[02:36:03.760 --> 02:36:06.080]
His ending was equally perverse throwing them all

[02:36:06.080 --> 02:36:11.260]
Contemplary back at his fans after manipulating them and teasing them for an hour with red herrings and a ginger cat

[02:36:12.680 --> 02:36:20.080]
After references and three shows the eights the second coming the last illusion that the rough beast slogged a toward Bethlehem by a day at the dinner table in the final scene

[02:36:20.080 --> 02:36:22.940]
The least Mr. Chase could have just up with some mere anarchy

[02:36:23.640 --> 02:36:28.740]
Surely after eight years with his family we deserve some revelation better than life goes on or not

[02:36:29.500 --> 02:36:34.780]
The only revelation was that Mr. Chase and James Gandalfine are keeping their options open for a soprano's movie

[02:36:34.780 --> 02:36:40.560]
Leon Beaselteer the literary editor of the new republic and a soprano's a fissionado who liked them might or might not ending

[02:36:40.560 --> 02:36:43.180]
Tells me I made too much of the foreshadowing of the eights poem

[02:36:44.560 --> 02:36:46.340]
It's overused to express unhappiness

[02:36:46.340 --> 02:36:51.380]
He said if you're at a restaurant and you want to link Winnie and the only have Manek outie we're slots into her Bethlehem

[02:36:53.820 --> 02:36:54.740]
She didn't like it

[02:36:55.320 --> 02:36:57.640]
Right needed to any one else

[02:36:58.060 --> 02:37:00.960]
Well except from the civil war let's hate shills and the suits yes

[02:37:00.960 --> 02:37:04.700]
And here I always thought marine was maybe a little bit of a suit with all his big words. He likes to use that

[02:37:04.700 --> 02:37:06.480]
She's not she's just smarter than I am that's all

[02:37:07.080 --> 02:37:10.200]
And that's why she writes to the New York Times and I work for the beastlies, but that's okay

[02:37:10.560 --> 02:37:14.220]
Making a couple of bucks much too much according to the audience way too much

[02:37:15.440 --> 02:37:19.840]
How could I keep feeding the horses it would buy no by way the slots if I weren't making all that money

[02:37:20.880 --> 02:37:22.880]
115 votes who is more overpaid

[02:37:24.680 --> 02:37:28.700]
You know that cheese that that was that was a good lesson. I just took there you know

[02:37:28.700 --> 02:37:33.760]
Because even though that particular brand of swiss has got zero carbs and which is fine, you know right?

[02:37:34.020 --> 02:37:37.740]
I had a bad hard medical loving yeah, it's still got it's cheese man right

[02:37:38.440 --> 02:37:40.320]
It's got killer electose

[02:37:40.860 --> 02:37:45.980]
So you can't eat carbs. You can't eat cheese. I think the only answer is yeah

[02:37:46.600 --> 02:37:47.320]
eat dirt

[02:37:48.780 --> 02:37:49.760]
1110 on the pole

[02:37:50.580 --> 02:37:55.280]
You know something if we really pushed on this we to made the 1150 that Chris was battling about earlier in the show

[02:37:55.280 --> 02:37:57.700]
Would you to just pick that number out of your ass of course

[02:37:58.980 --> 02:38:02.880]
Who is more overpaid big company CEO is 44% form eight of the eight

[02:38:04.300 --> 02:38:06.620]
Projox 277 about a quarter 25%

[02:38:06.620 --> 02:38:13.160]
Neil 121 11% think I'm paid too much well screw you mama so socks and hell

[02:38:13.880 --> 02:38:23.720]
Actors 75 lawyers 66 real is 56 stockbroker 17 rock stars 10 and by the way those 121 people guess what you're not getting in my will either

[02:38:25.660 --> 02:38:27.880]
Goodbye Charleston Riley

[02:38:29.260 --> 02:38:32.440]
We rested your head on your favorite bill

[02:38:32.440 --> 02:38:37.900]
That you use to fight to help enjoy your underground view

[02:38:39.060 --> 02:38:42.820]
Whoo, you'll need a pair of concrete shields now

[02:38:42.820 --> 02:38:45.480]
Maybe letter of route to keep you from floating

[02:38:45.480 --> 02:38:53.560]
The more of what so dumb that when she paid a visit to your grave instead of flower she placed it to pay

[02:38:54.520 --> 02:38:58.320]
That purple on yourself hard up you would think in your day

[02:38:58.320 --> 02:39:01.920]
When you couldn't say that you were

[02:39:01.920 --> 02:39:05.820]
Hey, but that's okay

[02:39:06.560 --> 02:39:08.260]
To everybody

[02:39:09.280 --> 02:39:10.100]
You anyway

[02:39:11.680 --> 02:39:12.280]
You failed

[02:39:12.280 --> 02:39:13.780]
You

[02:39:18.320 --> 02:39:23.280]
Don't bellow we spread summers and her husband jack would like to say

[02:39:23.860 --> 02:39:24.740]
That's

[02:39:29.160 --> 02:39:30.440]
145 at 560

[02:39:30.440 --> 02:39:35.720]
And I mean you hear I'm sorry chicken that got it careful so he's getting paid is that what you told me the eventually now

[02:39:36.100 --> 02:39:40.020]
No, it's not straight now. They're doing something. He might get paid this week and you know

[02:39:40.020 --> 02:39:41.860]
What do you mean they're doing something like they're taking a choice

[02:39:42.720 --> 02:39:45.220]
Okay, that's doing something. Yeah, I did that

[02:39:46.380 --> 02:39:50.060]
Clarissa Gilgay did make me any money. He said he wouldn't be great if he could get paid for that

[02:39:50.840 --> 02:39:51.780]
That would be great

[02:39:52.280 --> 02:39:57.140]
How about your Chris with all of his eating situation number to eat make a lot of money probably make a lot more that way

[02:39:57.140 --> 02:39:59.340]
Anyway can now you can make a big splash in that business

[02:40:01.420 --> 02:40:02.600]
Wouldn't be the first time

[02:40:04.460 --> 02:40:11.420]
1122 on the pool you're right mr. Nio you're right. We could made 1200 if you really really pushed on that earlier, but yeah, it's fine

[02:40:12.360 --> 02:40:19.800]
Don't set the bar too high is what I always say actually I never say that but then I'll say I did say that once before I'll say it again

[02:40:20.240 --> 02:40:23.300]
Don't set the bar too high. Don't make unrealistic goals, you know

[02:40:24.220 --> 02:40:28.080]
Like Chris, you know if you want to get up to like three four bucks an hour someday that might happen

[02:40:28.080 --> 02:40:34.380]
Yeah, I keep hoping but don't don't set it to like five six bucks an hour. What did you tell us that you were making an hour?

[02:40:34.900 --> 02:40:36.360]
Or did you tell me he didn't

[02:40:36.760 --> 02:40:40.900]
Maybe it's too embarrassing correct. It's less than 10 yes

[02:40:42.420 --> 02:40:46.980]
Now listen five no, oh, I think a minimum wage is higher than that

[02:40:48.580 --> 02:40:53.460]
Under this box and not these we got it now you think minimum wage is is higher than five bucks an hour

[02:40:53.460 --> 02:40:56.380]
I believe so no, okay, whatever you say

[02:40:57.000 --> 02:41:02.380]
The head of the FBI's Boston office is warning the region's top universities to be on the lookout for foreign spies

[02:41:02.380 --> 02:41:07.200]
Or potential terrorists who might be trying to steal unclassified yet sensitive research

[02:41:09.560 --> 02:41:13.080]
FBI warns colleges to watch for its spies is a headline here

[02:41:13.640 --> 02:41:20.620]
An FBI agent spent recently with officials at Harvard MIT the University of Massachusetts and other schools to train professors

[02:41:20.620 --> 02:41:24.660]
Students and security staff how to recognize anyone who might be trying to exploit research

[02:41:25.540 --> 02:41:31.220]
More visits are scheduled as part of a larger nationwide program since special agent in charge war and Bamford

[02:41:32.180 --> 02:41:38.320]
He stressed that the FBI isn't seeking a sense of information or stop the free flow information just raise awareness

[02:41:38.320 --> 02:41:38.940]
Right

[02:41:40.000 --> 02:41:43.640]
The academic community is designed to be open and we just have to make the community aware

[02:41:43.640 --> 02:41:50.180]
He said Worcester, Politically Institution President Dennis Burkey said the FBI told researchers to protect laptops

[02:41:50.720 --> 02:41:54.580]
Especially in foreign countries and to be worried about who contacts them about their work

[02:41:55.300 --> 02:42:00.460]
The general point was if there's unnatural or honest plan interest in your research and your nervous about it

[02:42:00.460 --> 02:42:05.440]
Here's how to be in touch with us Burkey said he said WPI already takes precautions to protect research

[02:42:05.440 --> 02:42:08.480]
That's Worcester Politic Institute WPI

[02:42:09.260 --> 02:42:11.240]
Or some might say Worcester

[02:42:12.060 --> 02:42:14.420]
How stupid you have to be to say Worcester

[02:42:15.080 --> 02:42:18.220]
Worcester should have to say jealousy yet Worcester Shire

[02:42:19.120 --> 02:42:25.200]
Boston College will probably follow some of the FBI's advice folks from Kevin Shay said Boston College was very appreciative of their outreach

[02:42:26.320 --> 02:42:30.200]
John Reinstein who sounds and what kind of a Jewish guy's name John

[02:42:30.960 --> 02:42:34.660]
Legal director of the ACLU of Massachusetts Express Reservations about the program

[02:42:34.660 --> 02:42:37.540]
Witting there could be a chilling effect on students or researchers

[02:42:37.540 --> 02:42:43.020]
Are you go ask all the questions you want to ask if someone is out there taking notes and reporting the FBI you ask the question

[02:42:43.020 --> 02:42:45.860]
Which they perceive this suspicious he be asking huh

[02:42:47.060 --> 02:42:50.960]
And I think that was followed by a musical if I I scooted all up by this

[02:42:53.220 --> 02:42:54.780]
Right and should have been anyway

[02:42:57.280 --> 02:43:02.020]
1130 in our prestige is full about who's most overpaid and all those people have said me

[02:43:02.460 --> 02:43:05.380]
Jalice is a bad I'm glad we got that whole jealousy thing today

[02:43:06.020 --> 02:43:09.300]
Because that's what it's all about right. It's a very bad trade, you know

[02:43:10.820 --> 02:43:16.140]
Like Rick Riley was always jealous. What did you say? Yeah, that was among his issues

[02:43:17.560 --> 02:43:21.540]
Now you're gonna start picking on him again. You always deny that you hate him. I don't hate him

[02:43:22.400 --> 02:43:26.620]
Or dislike him. I did at a time and we got over it

[02:43:27.380 --> 02:43:29.540]
You always deny that you don't like him

[02:43:30.540 --> 02:43:31.060]
No doubt

[02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:39.220]
The risk of suicide among male U.S. veterans is double out of the general population according to a study published this week

[02:43:40.140 --> 02:43:45.220]
We need to be more alert to the problem of suicide as major. I want to write a suicide among broadcasters is

[02:43:46.200 --> 02:43:48.200]
Wow and radio salespeople

[02:43:48.800 --> 02:43:51.860]
Not what it should be not anywhere near what it ought to be, you know

[02:43:53.060 --> 02:43:55.240]
There's Todd direct still worked there by the one sure

[02:43:56.080 --> 02:43:59.980]
Todd wreck and PD Lenny who came back and Brian Schmutz

[02:44:01.100 --> 02:44:01.540]
Yep

[02:44:03.140 --> 02:44:06.460]
We need to be more alert to the problem of suicide as a major public health issue

[02:44:06.460 --> 02:44:11.280]
We need to do better screening among individuals who have served in the military probe for their mental health risk as well as

[02:44:11.280 --> 02:44:16.860]
Gun availability said dr. Mark Kaplan professor of community health at Portland State University in Oregon

[02:44:17.360 --> 02:44:18.720]
lead the author of the study

[02:44:19.580 --> 02:44:23.480]
For 12 years Kaplan and his team of researchers follow more than a hundred four thousand veterans

[02:44:23.480 --> 02:44:25.720]
What served in the armed forces at some time between

[02:44:25.720 --> 02:44:31.360]
1917 and 1994 and compared them with more than 216,000 non-veterans

[02:44:32.120 --> 02:44:34.380]
In all between 1986 and 1997

[02:44:34.920 --> 02:44:36.680]
500 eight of them committed suicide

[02:44:36.680 --> 02:44:39.640]
197 veterans and 311 non-veterans

[02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:46.580]
After adjusting for a host of potentially compounding factors including age, time, and service and health status

[02:44:46.580 --> 02:44:52.360]
The study showed that those who have been in a military were 2.13 times more likely that I have suicide over time

[02:44:53.540 --> 02:45:01.720]
A biggest risk were veterans who were white those who had gone to college and those with activity limitations according to the study which was funded by the national institute of mental health

[02:45:02.820 --> 02:45:07.860]
Still Kaplan wouldn't say that the study proves that military service itself results in an increased risk of suicide

[02:45:07.860 --> 02:45:11.040]
I never feel comfortable claiming a casual relationship

[02:45:11.040 --> 02:45:17.400]
He said or is that causal causal excuse me. What's getting late in the day, you know? That's that cheese life is too complex

[02:45:18.100 --> 02:45:23.520]
No surprise was the finding that veterans were more likely to use guns to end their lives than whether non-veteran counterparts

[02:45:24.920 --> 02:45:27.800]
One and to unanticipate the finding was that being overweight

[02:45:28.280 --> 02:45:32.880]
appeared to confer protection from suicide by more than 50% Chris

[02:45:34.640 --> 02:45:39.200]
So in the old way, it appeared to confer protection maybe all of that comfort eating might do it

[02:45:39.200 --> 02:45:43.660]
Oh, I feel suicidal, but you know since there's some Ben and Jerry's fish food might come me down right now

[02:45:44.760 --> 02:45:49.480]
Some briar score ice cream maybe a leader take me to your leader might come me down. I'll put away the gun

[02:45:51.020 --> 02:45:52.880]
That interesting uh-huh

[02:45:52.880 --> 02:46:00.840]
And of course those of us who are overweight a lot of times it's been said it's kind of like a slow-form a suicide death by carbs

[02:46:02.400 --> 02:46:06.680]
Kaplan said of a posity of that on the subject, but said it might have to do with the fact that people are underweight

[02:46:06.680 --> 02:46:10.160]
I'm more likely to smoke and smokers are more likely to be depressed

[02:46:11.020 --> 02:46:12.540]
I never heard that before did you?

[02:46:12.540 --> 02:46:13.260]
Nope

[02:46:14.140 --> 02:46:19.020]
Smokers are more likely to be depressed and you want to know the reason why they're smoking the wrong thing? No

[02:46:20.180 --> 02:46:26.500]
Because there's no more cigarette advertising. That's why they'd be pressed back in the day when it was cigarette advertising and on television

[02:46:27.540 --> 02:46:27.940]
magazines

[02:46:28.620 --> 02:46:31.340]
Full-page ads everywhere you look there was another full-page ad

[02:46:32.640 --> 02:46:35.100]
Things that would keep you know in a might and better mood

[02:46:41.120 --> 02:46:41.480]
Like

[02:46:41.480 --> 02:46:44.840]
Yeah, how can you not have a good chocolate with that right right

[02:46:46.620 --> 02:46:49.780]
Well, there you go smoking now. What does it say against smokers are what?

[02:46:50.020 --> 02:46:52.860]
Deep press that line again smokers are more likely to be depressed

[02:46:53.360 --> 02:46:55.100]
Maybe it's because they keep coughing it's your

[02:46:55.100 --> 02:47:00.600]
And maybe they feel that big tumor growing in their lungs. Do you think that might be it that could be

[02:47:01.880 --> 02:47:06.660]
Like in a movie the great city to to to to to tumors in that to trouble

[02:47:18.700 --> 02:47:20.840]
I'm dying on the hand joy

[02:47:21.560 --> 02:47:21.820]
is

[02:47:23.880 --> 02:47:24.460]
huh

[02:47:30.600 --> 02:47:31.260]
Absolutely

[02:47:31.260 --> 02:47:33.260]
The

[02:47:51.720 --> 02:47:55.720]
ads

[02:48:00.600 --> 02:48:27.120]
P師 added a lot of

[02:48:27.120 --> 02:48:28.060]
I'm going to be a good man.

[02:48:29.480 --> 02:48:31.700]
Joyce won't let me go.

[02:48:32.680 --> 02:48:34.800]
Joyce won't let me go.

[02:48:35.840 --> 02:48:39.700]
Joyce won't let me go.

[02:48:42.160 --> 02:48:43.880]
I don't want to hear anything more.

[02:48:44.100 --> 02:48:45.660]
I'm not meant to talk about me.

[02:48:45.720 --> 02:48:47.000]
Anybody out there, I'm not around.

[02:48:47.100 --> 02:48:48.700]
I'm sure I take up the windows,

[02:48:48.920 --> 02:48:50.020]
care about it, I don't get it.

[02:48:50.020 --> 02:48:50.940]
I'm afraid about me.

[02:48:51.140 --> 02:48:52.220]
I just got to be just going.

[02:48:52.460 --> 02:48:53.600]
I don't think I'd get to this business

[02:48:53.600 --> 02:48:55.440]
and don't let anything keep wanting that out.

[02:48:55.440 --> 02:48:57.200]
You better wake up, boy,

[02:48:57.260 --> 02:48:59.880]
you're spending that long in some Joel Tesla DS.

[02:49:00.960 --> 02:49:02.240]
A kid now understand.

[02:49:04.000 --> 02:49:04.400]
Hmm, you know.

[02:49:04.620 --> 02:49:05.500]
He's just, you know, he can play the ball.
