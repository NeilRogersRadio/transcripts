[00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:12.700]
Sometimes I feel that life is having me by.

[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:23.520]
Sometimes I feel that people don't want to smile.

[00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.860]
And I turn on my radio.

[00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.920]
It makes me smile like a child.

[00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.480]
Theil's rudges on my radio.

[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.320]
Theil's rudges on my radio.

[00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.740]
You fell, yeah.

[00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.040]
Hello.

[00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:48.920]
Hello?

[00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:49.920]
Yes.

[00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.660]
You are disatoba.

[00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.380]
You are telling me if puppy is a puppy, Ronnie?

[00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:58.080]
A puppy?

[00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:58.560]

[00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:59.480]
Yes, puppy.

[00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:01.380]
Ronnie, I don't have a name.

[00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.240]
Is this a man but an ass name puppy?

[00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.800]
Yes.

[00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.920]
You want to talk to a man but an ass name puppy, Ronnie?

[00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.800]
Yes.

[00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:11.520]
Baby.

[00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:13.520]
Baby, is this baby?

[00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.980]
What is this?

[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.520]
Baby, what is it?

[00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.440]
Baby, puppy, are you?

[00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.620]
Yes.

[00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:19.700]
That's Ronnie.

[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.880]
That's Ronnie.

[00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:26.340]
That's Ronnie.

[00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.740]

[00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.060]
No one but me.

[00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.760]
It's not here?

[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.160]
No.

[00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.960]
I'll get the name.

[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.560]
No.

[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.640]
No.

[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.620]
I hope he be Ronnie.

[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:34.840]
That's what I'm saying that is.

[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.440]
Too bad we can't play the real good ones.

[00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:38.100]
Oh, yeah.

[00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.440]
Wow, there's a lot of good stuff we can't play.

[00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:41.440]
I'm so whipped up about the...

[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.700]
You told me yesterday about this disc.

[00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.080]
No, not that kind of disc.

[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.840]
Does this day send me a long time ago?

[00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.080]
Right.

[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.680]
I went to scouring through here.

[00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:51.660]
And there are some really great stuff on here.

[00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:52.380]
Yes, there is.

[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.800]
Including all that boring stuff.

[00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.400]
Do you know a coffee, book, chick?

[00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.040]
Hello.

[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.980]
See now when you get the movie with the real subtitles.

[00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.980]
I'll put your friends on the screen.

[00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:05.520]
I like you.

[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.360]
Do you like me?

[00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:07.280]
I do like you.

[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:08.880]
You're one of my friends.

[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:10.800]
You're a nice young man and I am your friend.

[00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.960]
You will be my boyfriend.

[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.660]
I won't be your boyfriend.

[00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:14.440]
Why not?

[00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:15.440]
You don't like me?

[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:16.640]
I can be.

[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:17.100]
You don't like me.

[00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.100]

[00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.980]
No boyfriend, yeah.

[00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.900]
Sure.

[00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.200]
You got to see it.

[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.960]
This is something called a movie show.

[00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.480]
It's a movie show.

[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:25.600]
It's a movie show.

[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:26.880]
It's been in my country.

[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.040]
I'll tell you which one of these I like the best is...

[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.420]
...Mitch Lewis.

[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.560]
Oh, yeah.

[00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.240]
It makes Lewis Lewis lose.

[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.880]
I want to be a man.

[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.000]
I want to be a man.

[00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.640]
I want to be a man.

[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.960]
I want to be a man.

[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.960]
I want to be a man.

[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.940]
I want to be a man.

[00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.080]
I want to be a man.

[00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.540]
I want to be a man.

[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:01.000]
I want to be a man.

[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.640]
All right.

[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.160]
There we go.

[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.400]
And I'll tell you about your people.

[00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:07.380]
Of course.

[00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.640]
Well, let's just say...

[00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.880]
...Mitch Yem Foo...

[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.160]
...Kilabira Mepato...

[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.040]
That's also a bit.

[00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:20.240]
How about your partner?

[00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.940]
That's also a bit.

[00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.680]
No.

[00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.420]
Of course it is.

[00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:24.060]
What?

[00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:25.760]
You think I'm stupid or something?

[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:26.620]
I don't answer please.

[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:27.840]
What is a Mexican Julian?

[00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.940]
No, is he a Mexican?

[00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:31.560]
No, I'm a Mexican Julian.

[00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.980]
Why?

[00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.620]
You can't lie.

[00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:33.580]
You can't say anything.

[00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:38.640]
Sometimes I feel...

[00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.540]
...that I don't want to smile.

[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.960]
Wow, wow.

[00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.020]
I like to smile on my radio.

[00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:48.080]
Next, I smile.

[00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:48.780]
I just smile.

[00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.220]
I like to know my radio.

[00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.160]
New, I just want my radio.

[00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.080]
New, I just want my radio.

[00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.940]
New, I just want my radio.

[00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:02.360]
You feel...

[00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:03.880]
...new, I just want my radio.

[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.760]
Oh.

[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.260]
Oh, I say exactly.

[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:09.380]
But there's a whole bunch of good ones.

[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.680]
Too bad we can't play the really good one there that I like the best.

[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.440]
But we can't play this.

[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:14.880]
Sure, it's good.

[00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.320]

[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:23.980]
Sure, it's good.

[00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.980]

[00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.980]

[00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:24.800]
Sure, it's sweet to the point.

[00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:25.640]
Don't my favorite though.

[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:26.720]
The original is always the best.

[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:27.720]
Oh, oh, oh.

[00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:28.040]
We're full.

[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:33.760]
Sometimes I feel...

[00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.640]
...like life passing by.

[00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:40.080]
Oh, hey.

[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.760]
Sometimes I feel...

[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.520]
...that's a little bit like people don't want to smile.

[00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:54.600]
Oh, it'll listen to show of their nice.

[00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.880]
Maybe it's my like a child.

[00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:58.840]
You walk a life horse.

[00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:01.480]
You can hear me get by my friend.

[00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.140]
Bill Carter on a radio.

[00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:06.300]
You won't stop.

[00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.020]
Bill Carter on a radio.

[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.000]
Married, oh yeah.

[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.180]
Quack solid.

[00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:21.440]
Too bad we can have time to play it.

[00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:22.560]
Throw the Jews down the well.

[00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:24.080]
I guess we do.

[00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:24.980]
But we don't.

[00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:26.260]
So you know, I showed...

[00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:27.500]
...Bokobrand didn't want to see that movie.

[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.200]
I showed him one scene from it.

[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:29.840]
Bokobrand?

[00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.000]
Yeah, and I thought he was going to vomit and die.

[00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:32.700]
Really?

[00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:33.540]
So, please.

[00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.860]
That's why I felt watching that raising your zone of ear tonight.

[00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:38.520]
Well, what's the couple scenes I thought I was going to vomit and die?

[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:39.760]
But for different reasons, trust me.

[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:41.300]
Not because it was funny.

[00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.380]
You know, I was thinking to myself as I watched that.

[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:44.600]
What a pile of crap, man.

[00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:45.240]
That's what I was thinking.

[00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.280]
There's some real gems on here on this disc.

[00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:49.860]
Yeah, there are.

[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:52.760]
Some of the lost treasures, for example, a heraldosin.

[00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:53.220]
Isn't that right?

[00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:53.840]
That was the idea.

[00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.280]
No, she doesn't have it.

[00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:56.300]
That's not true at all.

[00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:56.960]
Don't you...

[00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.220]
You don't have a penis.

[00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:59.860]
It's a wonder-developed penis.

[00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:01.920]
That's what I was told when I was a small child.

[00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:04.000]
But Bokob, isn't it the fact that it's really your big problem?

[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.280]
You were told it's a small child.

[00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:06.980]
You said that you were a himaferdite.

[00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.700]
I was told a lot of things when I was a small child.

[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.640]
So, were you lied to you, Bokobrand?

[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.100]
I don't think I was lied to about my past.

[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:14.580]
No, not at all.

[00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:19.660]
Did you live your life in your early informative years as a woman?

[00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:20.540]
Yes.

[00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:23.560]
And it is totally...

[00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:26.280]
It is totally my whole life.

[00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:29.560]
How?

[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:33.200]
I...

[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:35.260]
I had to wonder...

[00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:37.480]
I'm a very athletic person.

[00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:39.640]
I've always been a jeans and t-shirt type girl.

[00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:40.240]
You fail.

[00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:43.180]
I wonder when it could unclose if I looked like a dyke.

[00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.600]
I wonder if it's the way I wear my hair.

[00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:48.540]
People are going to think I'm a dyke.

[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:49.040]
Absolutely.

[00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:51.140]
I wonder what people are thinking about me.

[00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.120]
I wonder how in the hell did I let this happen to me?

[00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:55.320]
How could I see this?

[00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:57.540]
Always check the package, baby.

[00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:01.340]
Canter.

[00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:12.540]
There's Al Gore sitting there, the former Vice President.

[00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:14.220]
It says happening now, I'm seeing him.

[00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:15.160]
You're in rocks.

[00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:17.320]
Oh my God he is...

[00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:19.580]
Good intentions, I'll give him that.

[00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:21.540]
Of course he was elected president in 2000.

[00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:25.920]
But all those things aside, it's like a comedy, you know?

[00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:32.940]
Anyway, here's the pull result from yesterday and we killed a lot of good time with it sometimes. I feel I love that stuff

[00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:39.340]
Call living in the past I guess. Well the past part of the past wasn't so bad in fact there are stuff if we could just select

[00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:41.780]
Those portions of the past that we can go back and relive

[00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:51.260]
Take me back to World Cup week it's not that long ago memory is still fresh in my mind

[00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:58.360]
1524 votes on a pull from yesterday if somebody from out of town visits South Florida make sure they don't miss and

[00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:00.940]
Look at this man. You talk about a feather in my cap

[00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:05.700]
Oh god the legendary near Roger show wins hands down your pants 387

[00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:11.340]
Make sure they don't miss it. I would advise them not to come in a first place 358

[00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:17.740]
That's my advice anybody listening around the universe. Oh look at this hundreds lineup for sheep testicles

[00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:18.980]
Well, we'll get to that story in a moment

[00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:26.100]
South Beach 297 there you go a lot of plastic people would like a lot of jewelry like tons of jewelry just dripping from their neck and

[00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:31.300]
Lots of gay people. They're outbound flight. Don't miss that 179 in fact

[00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:34.380]
You'll probably after the first hour or two you want to turn around make sure you catch it

[00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:38.200]
I hate this pull only 73 a mere 4.7 percent not bad

[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:44.880]
The sawgrass mills mall I evade it so schmaltzy man 42. I have no idea. You know like I told you you know

[00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:51.360]
Where it is compared to my house? I don't know what the big attraction is maybe somebody can explain it to me the sawgrass mill

[00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:58.020]
It's big. There are 700 different languages spoken there every day and not one of them is English 42 votes little Havana

[00:08:58.020 --> 00:08:59.660]
Speaking to English 39

[00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:03.540]
No speaking English a key the early bird dinner 31

[00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:11.380]
The jungle queen dinner crew is 31 lots of jungle queens my guy 23 and I I don't get it

[00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:19.420]
Cemetery village 22 Metro Zoo 22 the monkey general 12 the parachungal only five soltampo chinkway and

[00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:20.780]
Veskaya only three

[00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:23.300]
Now that's kind of surprising isn't it?

[00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:26.040]
I mean we put it on the at the end of the pool, but nevertheless yeah

[00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:29.380]
Well, what only three for Veskaya, which is supposed to be like legendary

[00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:34.580]
What's the big dealer? I've never been there. What's the big thing? It's big. It's beautiful beautiful gardens beautiful house beautiful

[00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:39.740]
Antiques for people who are into that kind of thing for big houses in the big big old houses with

[00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:41.820]
Carbon statues and gray

[00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:50.240]
He was into base stuff was he 797 votes on a day's pool so Chris can just sit back easy and duck brought everybody in breakfast there this morning

[00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:55.180]
Nice go crazy. He brought in an order of chicken fingers for us to share, but thank you, though. I gave it to Chris and

[00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:59.220]
Then I thought you said he brought everybody in breakfast like he brought a lot of food in

[00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:02.180]
To try to pacify you because it's your hot Wednesday

[00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:05.120]
You guys keep getting the scoot over every Wednesday because nothing's taken career

[00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:08.880]
So so in order to pacify for that he brought you in an order of chicken fingers

[00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:14.460]
Yes, which I gave to Chris, but thank you stuff just the same. Yeah, what is the big deal with that?

[00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:20.900]
He paid for it himself. Wow. Whoo heavy duty duster. Hey, Duff you're fairy

[00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:24.300]
11 past 10 at 560. We got no bogging today

[00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:25.700]
We got a full four hours man

[00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:27.820]
And I'm sure we got a lot of additions to our pool for today

[00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:31.060]
I see Tom Brady's already on there and most of the guys that want to be Tom Brady

[00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:34.820]
It's not because well because they want to be wealthy and they want to be a big famous jocke

[00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:38.440]
It's because of who he's doing you know they want to be they want to take his place

[00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.200]
And who can blame them when you come right down with I

[00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:45.720]
Wouldn't mind being Tom Brady. I'd rather be Brady Quinn. He's a few years younger

[00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:53.040]
Although if I was Brady Quinn, I would have gone and ordained could I've ever lived that down? Oh now the fighting Irish touchdown

[00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:59.000]
Jesus baby. Oh brother. There's another redundancy. What is that fighting Irish for that pole that we're gonna do?

[00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:03.360]
Drunken Irish fighting Irish drunk an Irishman. Oh, yeah, I do like that pole's a great idea

[00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:08.560]
It's not the one for tomorrow though already fast that they don't forget to change it this afternoon because it's wood by Wednesday

[00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:12.980]
I'll be fighting the good batter with hopefully a good machine on this afternoon. Oh

[00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:15.360]
I think you know just just

[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:20.320]
Common Luxus sooner or later. I'm not kind of do you know what I'm gonna think do for a good day at woodmine?

[00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:23.420]
Yeah, do or not is the case may be do the do is

[00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:27.360]
Do do you do that already done that I read done done do do

[00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:31.840]
No, hello everyone. This is more you've over chose to occur in a fair

[00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:34.560]
They don't come any better than Neil Roger several days ago

[00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:42.280]
I commented briefly on some recent statements that have been made by some members of Congress about Iraq and it's important to make this point at

[00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:43.260]
The outset

[00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:50.320]
The President of the United States purposely misled the American people on pre-war intelligence

[00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:57.820]
American soldiers and Marines serving in Iraq go out every day into some of the most dangerous and unpredictable conditions

[00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:02.760]
These brave Americans were sent into battle for a deliberate falsehood

[00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:07.920]
Pre-war information was distorted to corrupt the oil for food program

[00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:12.440]
There is no denying that the President lied to the American people

[00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:18.300]
This is revisionism of the most corrupt and shameless variety. It's also something I enjoy

[00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:25.040]
It's one of the reasons I've stayed in the business and I believe the feeling is probably the same for most of us in public life

[00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:27.860]
The President and his administration

[00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:31.340]
Hey our country and hate the liberties for which we stand

[00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:39.140]
They dwell in the shadows have no regard for the laws of warfare and feel unconstrained by any standard of morality

[00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:46.960]
The President of the United States is dishonest and reprehensible and none of us should want it any other way

[00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:48.080]
Thank you very much

[00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:51.580]
Thank you, Dick

[00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:56.460]
1017 at 560 W.Q. I'm happy it wins the two here's our lineup today

[00:12:56.460 --> 00:13:02.100]
We got the mad dog at two the power hour hank of the mad dog together one of those very rare days between four and five a second

[00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:08.500]
No, the power hour everybody take a shower and then you got Hank solo with the world golf championships at the Ralph

[00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:12.600]
I love that one promo that we're playing where it's like they're describing golf on a radio

[00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:17.040]
That is really simulating craft for a cane hotline at seven and any can item midnight tonight

[00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:22.980]
You know one thing since they blew out any case I'm more than I was before and very often hours when people might actually be awake

[00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:24.380]
It's scary

[00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:28.520]
Speaking of scary right on the hills of that channy bit Doug Thompson writes

[00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:32.240]
Well, you're not gonna read that already because you got to get to this pool and they're gonna be a zygian

[00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:34.140]
names that people want to put on the pool

[00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:36.520]
Let's get a zygian zany

[00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:42.240]
Zany collars today. I got a lot of an appalling like those. Yeah, those are my favorite and him too of course

[00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:46.620]
Doug Thompson says George W. Bush and the looming shadow of Richard and Nixon

[00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:53.360]
With each passing day George W. Bush's actions more closely mirror those of another monumentally failed president

[00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:55.700]
Richard and Nixon tricky dick

[00:13:56.540 --> 00:14:01.540]
Bush's performance Tuesday night trying to wiggle out of the escalating controversy over the politically motivated

[00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:09.560]
Fireings of a US attorney's is just another example of Nixon reborn and a corrupt president trapped by his own lies and malfeasance

[00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:16.320]
My refusing to let political guru Carl Rove and former White House council hearing admirers testify under oath before Congress

[00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:19.640]
Bush is forcing a showdown that'll cripple is already weakened presidency

[00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:25.960]
Yet Bush like Nixon reigns arrogant until the end determined to ignore the law political necessity or common sense

[00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:29.980]
Given the lies on top of lies that the White House has told Congress over the past six years

[00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:35.440]
There's no way either the House or Senate will accept unsworn off the record testimony for me the Rove or Myers

[00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:41.660]
The Democratic leadership of Congress and a growing number of Republicans want both on the record under oath where they can face

[00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:44.500]
Purgatory charges for the lies they will inevitably inevitably tell

[00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:49.940]
An increasingly bipartisan anger toward the way the Bush administration conducts his business surface like a title

[00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:52.900]
Wavy as today when the Senate voted 94 to 2

[00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:59.680]
To revoke Bush's authority to replace US attorneys a growing number of Republicans no longer stand by their embattled and scandal-ridden

[00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:05.120]
President and Bush like Nixon is fighting himself increasingly isolated from his own party and the American people

[00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:10.200]
The Bush that appeared before the cameras Tuesday that was not the swaggering W. Ahold

[00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:13.440]
But one of the look of a cornered animal wounded but defiant as

[00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:17.620]
Young reporter writing about a constitutional crisis in 1974

[00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:22.600]
I saw the same look in Nixon's eyes that he scrambled for political cover amid the growing Watergate scandal

[00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:28.500]
Nixon like Bush did on a crumbling political base pet by as many lies and bots to tempt to cover up his misdeeds

[00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:34.540]
Nixon released transcripts of White House conversations calling an extraordinary cooperation with Congress and its probe of Watergate

[00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:40.480]
Last night Bush used pretty much the same words to describe the White House release of emails and other records on the attorney

[00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:46.820]
Fireings history will forever define Nixon's failed presidency through Watergate and his fligrid attempt to subvert the Constitution

[00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:53.640]
History will forever define Bush's failed president seat through the Iraq War debacle and as many attempts to subvert the Constitution

[00:15:54.280 --> 00:16:00.300]
Both men violated their own to uphold the Constitution both failed to serve the people both broke the law one resigned in disgrace

[00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:03.300]
The final chapter on the other remains unwritten

[00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:08.500]
But we can be sure that the chapter when closed will reveal another sorted period in American history right?

[00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:09.160]
Stug Thompson

[00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:12.420]
I hope they don't come and get you too soon

[00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:16.460]
They're probably trying to try to dance down right now. They got that IP address

[00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:21.160]
They're right and I think they got the GP RS. They're like, you know, they're gonna shoe sell it

[00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:26.660]
Hounds they got their dividing just like that that the boys got the BG boards for that boy Scott that we were treated to

[00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:29.080]
455,000 hours of a cover John

[00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:33.860]
I don't think it's done. It's just wait for the ABC movie of the week. I can't wait. Here's the poll today

[00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:39.800]
And we already Chris about 832 on there aren't you really proud of that? Oh, I'm super proud 832

[00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:45.820]
Most if you could be or I see I see let me read it the way it's written. Okay, cuz I didn't write I don't write these anymore

[00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:48.900]
Anyhow if I could be somebody else for one day

[00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:52.160]
I would be Hugh Heftar 250 see I hate to break

[00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:57.780]
I know I know what you guys are driving at but you know the problem is Hugh Heftar is probably about 140 years old right now

[00:16:57.780 --> 00:17:03.440]
It's probably as limp as a Chinese noodle and you're just you know, you have things for that a lot of good memories

[00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:06.300]
I guess that's all you want is my address

[00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:11.320]
Yeah, I probably got that too probably got like you know some people have bowls full of candy on the

[00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:16.220]
Copy table. He's got bowls full of all that crap. He's got him like an a pes dispenser. He carries

[00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:17.400]
Oh

[00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:21.880]
They still make pes dispensers in that's way yes, they do I love that

[00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:27.200]
The only problem with that is that when you're like a sugar holic like I've been almost all my life is it don't do it

[00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:31.240]
You take that little dispenser like a like a little cigarette lighter like a little fag lighter

[00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:34.780]
We'll fill it up with baby fill it up with peasant and you like eat the whole roll

[00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:42.680]
Hugh Heftar 250 for I gotta be me 209. Oh, let's play that again. Now Sammy Davis here you go. Keep an eye out for Sammy

[00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:45.680]
I gotta be me 209. That's just

[00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:49.900]
Knowing this crowd that's particularly ridiculous Tiger Woods a hundred

[00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:54.100]
Huh, and that's that because of his hot blonde wife is that what that's all about?

[00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:55.960]
It's gotta be yes and his money

[00:17:56.740 --> 00:18:01.300]
Well, there you go. It's not about combo. I'm proud that's why he's got that hot blonde wife. There's no question

[00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:03.960]
I hate this pose. It's kind of like Wayne Greskey needle nose

[00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:07.960]
I mean who the hell would want it get anywhere near him, but he's got a hot young blonde wife

[00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:13.660]
There's a lot of money. I hate this pull 597 percent. That's a little bit too high if he acts me

[00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:18.000]
Howard Stern 42 Bill Clinton 40 Neil Rogers 36

[00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:22.640]
The only thing I could say about that is if you were me for one day you could be legendary

[00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:26.360]
For a day or like the old TV game show queen for a day

[00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:29.060]
George W. Bush 35

[00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:31.540]
Anyone but who I am 29

[00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:34.600]
Anybody but me 29

[00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:41.660]
Wayne Heising a 17 Tom Brady is moving up the ladder fast man. They want Tom's action believe you me

[00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:47.220]
I would mind some action with Tom 12 and Hillary Clinton only eight the ice princess who want to be here

[00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:51.280]
Well, that's just the original list that the plus Tom Brady's in addition. He's an add-on

[00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:55.020]
Klingon and add-on. He's already up to 15 vote. He's right on Wayne's ass

[00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:58.940]
Why would anybody want to be a win? Don't we want to add Bill Gates on there because of all his money?

[00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:00.680]
I

[00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:02.100]
Thought so that'd be a choice

[00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:04.760]
I mean there's gonna be a zinning more names on that pole

[00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:09.460]
This is just the this is kind of a skeleton list from our whoever sent this in over university dodge

[00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:12.280]
Who instead of doing any work as busy sending us to stuff every day?

[00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:17.160]
Which I respect that that's probably guys who aren't trying to do too much work or busy communicating with us

[00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:25.820]
That's that's my favorite five six seven oh five sixty and pound five sixty and the Verizon singular wireless line WQ. I am hello

[00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:58.300]
But first I have to bypass my other ways

[00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:03.320]
Maybe down the clock and fill in for me because

[00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:07.080]
Regis filbert's got a quad up hot

[00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:11.240]
A bunch of doctors looking at my chart

Big deal it's big and a boat I think what they had to do is have the open art surgery right on the ear on the Regis in a Kelly show

[00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:47.040]
Since he's he seems to be so a help in unlike dying on the ear or whatever

[00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:49.900]
Okay, maybe I can do it

[00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:56.520]
Virginia City Nevada we have 868 in the pool by the way the thousands of Guadantee no sweat

Hundreds of people waited lines from to an hour for a chance to take something different at the 16th annual mountain oyster fry

[00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:20.480]
Mountain oysters baby. Oh boy

Servers at five booths dispensed about 130 pounds of fried oysters or sheep testicles at the Saturday event

[00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:30.400]
The historic mining town about 25 miles southeast of Reno

[00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:34.280]
Visitors gave mixed reviews to the tiny morsels which can be fried

[00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:37.620]

And Tom Brady is zooming up the list. He's got 18 votes already if you could be somebody else other than who you are

[00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:20.900]
I can't believe we don't have 80 million people calling in right now with suggestions on this pool

[00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:24.460]
Now that we want that badly and desperately and they were inviting it

Like this last guy wants to be who after in this prime

[00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:49.880]
See the question isn't that I mean obviously that's gonna be a big part of it for a lot of you guys because that's you've got one track mind like me

[00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:54.040]
So all they know about is who you know, who can I do who can I do I want me a lot of action

[00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:57.240]
Yeah, well, so what's wrong with that nothing? I would agree with that certainly

[00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:01.760]
But I mean if that's gonna be the only criterion for who you're gonna pick on here

[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:04.520]
You know when you rather be somebody brilliant and famous uh, no

[00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:08.620]
How about somebody brilliant and famous who gets a lot of action?

[00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:16.220]
Oh, is this isn't as cute I'd be the father of an Nicole's baby. It says one day is an uptime to transfer all that money to my account

I beg your pardon I want for the poll yeah, go ahead. Shukil O'Neill

[00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:37.320]
Shukil O'Neill

[00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:38.420]
Shukil O'Neill

[00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:40.740]
Yeah, one bad guy would be you to be honest with you

[00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:45.660]
I had the pleasure of going in his house. I work for son advice through installations and I had the pleasure of going in his house

[00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:52.540]
And the gentleman has touched the doctor's person being without the money that he has and all he's really down to earth honest and

[00:28:53.140 --> 00:28:58.160]
Good-hearted person and I mean just the size of that man. He if he's picked every one so

[00:28:59.320 --> 00:28:59.720]
Okay

[00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:07.380]
Just the size of that man. I'm surprised he didn't say John Holmes if that's uh where we're going, you know

[00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:09.620]
Whatever here's a guy wants to be

[00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:16.420]
Me shack to bed we go that's what I think he was trying to say he wants to hang out with Shaq literally

[00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:18.120]
884 votes on a poll

[00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:20.460]
900 becoming any second now

[00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:25.240]
892 as a matter of fact now they're coming in chunks. They took him for a little while to get going this morning

[00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:28.520]
Must have been extra coma inducing now. Don't say that

[00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:36.260]
Why are you starting in again with those guys right now? I did not do my duty here to get my copy out

[00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:40.660]
I'm just I'm just all confused. I think what it started was when ducking in this morning

[00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:42.640]
I thought he brought you guys a whole bunch of food

[00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:45.840]
It's all right, Doc. You don't need to worry about it

[00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:49.300]
No, he should worry about it. I mean he should have brought you like sacks and sacks full of crap

[00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:54.580]
Or instead of spending you know his own money could have gotten the charm guys to take with care of you people

[00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:59.280]
Which he did not something's going on there that he must not be telling us. Well, what do you mean by that?

[00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:02.320]
I know you loves them. They love us supposedly. They don't love me

[00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:08.100]
The truck they love to our hot and I told you I told you is it in times on the way back from my a pill doctor in Tamarack

[00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:11.000]
Every time I would stop at that one there on uphill road in Tamarack

[00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:13.640]
And give me like a sausage with

[00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:15.760]
Whatever meet

[00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:20.880]
Yeah, the sausage with me is always good, but at any rate they don't like me

[00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:25.360]
And maybe they hate you like for maybe last time they were in here in person. Yeah, it's Chris

[00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:31.680]
They were there in person. They said what they said that we love you guys and you guys are great and you guys but not me

[00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:33.860]
I want to know we're talking about you

[00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:40.340]
By start us out like me green now get out of him me

[00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:49.080]
Boy that one dropping where Randy says she's so old with chair. I'm a woman. I stained the chair. Oh, she's staying

[00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:51.460]
Excuse me. Oh, that takes us all back

[00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:54.200]
24 load at 560 WQ

[00:30:58.660 --> 00:31:03.000]
Sometimes I feel myself

[00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:03.940]
night

[00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:09.000]
Phil's presents the game's greatest scores

[00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:13.600]
He was born Thomas Edward Brady Jr

[00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:22.300]
And he grew to rule a new England dynasty three Super Bowl rings twice Super Bowl NDP

[00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:28.000]
And a playoff resume akin to a first class ticket to Canton, Ohio

[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:34.340]
However his powers on the gridiron gives way only to his powers in the bedroom

[00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:43.520]
For late in the 2006 season Tom Brady achieved the greatest back to back scoring feet in the modern era

[00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:48.480]
First he impregnated sultry Hollywood starlet Bridget Moynihan

[00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:54.620]
Then against all odds this heroic field general bedded and inseminated

[00:31:54.620 --> 00:31:56.540]
lingerie Supermodel

[00:31:57.760 --> 00:31:58.440]
Buncheon

[00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:05.220]
In honor of his triumphs between the hash marks and between the sheets

[00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:11.640]
We bequeath the laurels and regale among the games greatest scores number 12

[00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:13.540]
Tom Brady

[00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:18.560]
Nice 1046. How's Tommy doing on the pool? By the way, he's all the way up to 23 votes. He's right

[00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:21.160]
I'm right behind anyone but who I am

[00:32:22.220 --> 00:32:28.600]
Larry Kramer writes why do straights hate gays in the LA Times an 1872 year old gay man isn't hopeful about the future

[00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:30.940]
It's a good article. I'm just gonna read it

[00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:36.940]
Larry Kramer's founder of the protest group act up an author of the tragedy of today's gays today's gays

[00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:39.360]
He says dear straight people

[00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:45.120]
Why do you hate gay people so much? Gays are hated. Proof me wrong. Your top general does call us immoral

[00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:50.980]
Marine general Peter Pace shimmer of the joint cheeses in charge of an estimated 65,000 gay lesbian troops

[00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:52.520]
Some fighting for our country in Iraq

[00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:58.080]
A right wing political commentator and colder gets away with calling a straight presidential candidate a faggot

[00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:02.780]
Even gyrism killer of all people is making really tacky jokes about gay parents in his column

[00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:08.780]
This I guess doesn't qualify as hate except that it's so distasteful and dumb often a first step on the way to hate

[00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:16.040]
Senators help me rot in Clinton and Barack Obama try to duck the questions that paces big if he raised confirming what gay people know

[00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:22.840]
That there's not one candidate running for public office anywhere who dares to come right on and equifically and say decent support of things about us

[00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:24.820]
Gays shouldn't vote for any of them

[00:33:24.820 --> 00:33:28.260]
There's not a candidate or major public figure who would not sell gays down the river

[00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:33.780]
We've seen this time after time even from supposedly progressive politicians like Bill Clinton with his don't ask

[00:33:33.780 --> 00:33:37.780]
Tell policy on gays in the military and his support of the hideous defensive marriage act

[00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:41.740]
Of course it's possible that being shunned by gays will make politicians more popular

[00:33:41.740 --> 00:33:46.820]
But at least we'll have ourself respect to vote for them is to collude with them in their uttered disdain for us

[00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:54.720]
Don't any of you wonder why heterosexual treat gay so brutally year after year after year as your people take away our manhood our womanhood our personhood

[00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:57.220]
Why even as we die you don't leave us alone

[00:33:57.700 --> 00:34:02.760]
What can we leave our surviving lovers is tacked for more punitively than what you leave your legal surviving spouses

[00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:03.880]
Why do you do this?

[00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:09.680]
My lover will be unable to afford to live in the house we've made for each other over our lifetime together. This doesn't happen to you

[00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:15.520]
Taxation without representation is what led to the revolutionary war gay people have paid all the taxes you have

[00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:20.480]
But you have equality and we don't and there's no sign that this situation will change anytime soon

[00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:24.620]
President Bush will leave a legacy of hate for us that will take many decades to cleanse

[00:34:25.220 --> 00:34:29.680]
He has packed virtually every court and every civil service position in the land where people don't like us

[00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:31.640]
So even with the most tolerant of new presidents

[00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:34.280]
Gays will be unable to break free from this yoke of hate

[00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:39.740]
Courts ruled against gays with hateful regularity and of course the supreme court is not going to give us our quality

[00:34:39.740 --> 00:34:46.040]
And in the end so to speak it's from the supreme court that such equality must come if all of this isn't hate. I don't know what hate is

[00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:50.160]
Our feeble gay movement confines most of its demands to marriage

[00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:54.540]
But political candidates are not talking about and we're not demanding that they talk about equality

[00:34:54.540 --> 00:34:57.860]
My lover and I don't want to get married just yet, but we want to be sure to be equal

[00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:01.560]
You must know that gays get beaten up all the time all over the world

[00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:05.760]
If someone beats you up because of who you are you're racer ethnic origin. That's considered a hate crime

[00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:11.340]
But in most states gays are not included in hate crime measures and Congress is refused to include us in a federal act

[00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:16.920]
Homosexuality is a punishable crime in the zygian countries as is any activism on behalf of it

[00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:23.920]
Punishable means prison punishable means death the US government refused our request that a protest after gay teenagers were hanged in Iran

[00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:25.500]
But it protested many other foreign

[00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:31.740]
Cruelties who cares if a faggot dies parts of the Episcopal Church in the US are joining with the Nigerian Archbishop

[00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:33.560]
Who believes gays should be put in prison?

[00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:37.120]
Episcopalians whoever thought we'd have to worry about Episcopalians

[00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:43.100]
Well whoever thought we'd have to worry about Florida a young gay man was just killed in Florida because of his sexual orientation

[00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:47.540]
I get reports of gays slain in our country every week few of them even make the news

[00:35:47.540 --> 00:35:53.820]
Few are prosecuted you consider it acceptable that 20,000 Christian youths make an annual pilgrimage to San Francisco

[00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:57.680]
To pray for gay souls. This is not free speech. This is another version of hate

[00:35:57.680 --> 00:36:00.140]
It's all one world of gay hate and it always was

[00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:05.340]
Gays will realize that the more we become visible the more we come out of the closet the more we're hated

[00:36:05.340 --> 00:36:09.260]
Don't those of you straights who claim not to hate us have a responsibility to announce the hate

[00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:16.260]
Why is it socially acceptable to joke about girly men or to discriminate against us legally with constitutional amendments ban in gay marriage

[00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:20.280]
Because we cannot marry we can pass on only a fraction of our estates

[00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:23.180]
We don't have equal part out parenting rights and we can't live with a foreigner

[00:36:23.180 --> 00:36:25.460]
We love who doesn't have government permission to stay in this country

[00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:29.100]
These are the equal protections that the Bill of Rights for Finns for all of us

[00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:32.380]
Why do you hate us so much that you won't permit us to legally love?

[00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:37.360]
I'm almost 72 and I've been hated all my life and I don't see much change coming. I think your hate is evil

[00:36:38.540 --> 00:36:40.080]
What do we do to you that's so awful?

[00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:45.280]
Why do you feel compelled to come after us with such frightful energy to this somehow make you feel safer and legitimate?

[00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:50.980]
What possible harm comes to you if we marry or our tax just like you or are protected from assault by laws that say

[00:36:50.980 --> 00:36:53.060]
It's morally wrong to assault people out of hatred

[00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:59.100]
The reasons always out for our religious ones, but certainly they're not based on the love all religions proclaim

[00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:05.380]
And even if your objections to gays our religious why do you have to legislate them so hatefully make no mistake

[00:37:05.380 --> 00:37:08.520]
Forbiting gay people to love her marry is based on hate pure and simple

[00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:12.320]
You may say you don't hate us, but the people you vote for do so what's the difference?

[00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:18.120]
Our own company's democratic process that clears us to be unequal which means in a democracy that our enemy is you

[00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:22.440]
You treat us like crumbs you hate us and sadly we let you do it

[00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:28.400]
I don't hate you. You go Larry. You're fair. What? I don't hate you man. Well, you're going too bad. Yes, you do

[00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:30.660]
So I don't let me ask you well

[00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:33.660]
Let me ask you one thing about you like it see

[00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:38.780]
I'd like to hold you on the pole. They like our pole today although they don't I am just shocked

[00:37:38.780 --> 00:37:43.180]
I mean this pole is so wide open you'd thought there'd be a zillion people that they would want to put on here

[00:37:43.180 --> 00:37:48.940]
You know as opposed to the stupid thing last Friday well of all the stupid expressions. Yeah, well that was pretty good. Well, is all right

[00:37:48.940 --> 00:37:53.060]
I mean, there's a lot of stupid expression that has a lot of stupid people and lots you know

[00:37:54.460 --> 00:37:58.200]
922 on that pole none for George Rodriguez yet in Paul Allen's guts. He's got one

[00:37:58.980 --> 00:38:05.140]
What nobody wants to be you? No question. No kidding trust. I think even I think even you probably was just gonna say that

[00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:07.200]
Oh

[00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:12.820]
Brady Quinn your buddy Moeshy says put great of wings got more girls than Jerry's got curls. I

[00:38:12.820 --> 00:38:13.800]
Have no idea what that means

[00:38:14.820 --> 00:38:16.580]
You have any idea what that means no

[00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:22.880]
Brady Quinn put him on the pole right away. Well, there's one five six seven oh five sixty. I already said I wanted to be Brady Quinn

[00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:25.040]

[00:38:47.660 --> 00:38:48.120]

[00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:58.960]
I just want to put a day

[00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:02.880]
Okay, I didn't leave the house. Yeah

[00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:08.520]
I had a couple hours with him back on Zeta that day, but I just you know, I missed my chance just like

[00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:12.080]
Soloto said to godfather. I missed my chance. I'm the 101

[00:39:13.540 --> 00:39:19.500]
Remember that? Resurrect. Do Soloto. I am nothing don't start with that godfather stuff again WQ a-m

[00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:24.420]
Hello, yeah, sir. I have a first one I comment about the bill right

[00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:28.880]
The center is founded on double standard slave owners wanted to be free

[00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:34.340]
Yeah, second. I got a poll for you from the future best year ever for music and

[00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:41.240]
Music in what movies like what movie and what music was out in that year that made it great

[00:39:41.820 --> 00:39:46.320]
Okay, well, Talba let's also start with 1801 and we'll move on up from there. What do you think?

[00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:49.520]
5 6 7 0 5 60

[00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:53.760]
How about this poll today? I don't think this is a bad poll if I could be somebody else for one day

[00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:58.240]
I would be blank. I mean you'd think there's be a billion choices on there, you know like poopy combo

[00:39:58.240 --> 00:39:59.240]
They've got away

[00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:02.680]
Gene Rayburn things like that, you know Paul Lind

[00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:06.160]
John Stockwell

[00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:09.020]
WQ a-m hello

[00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:10.920]
Good morning. You good morning, sir

[00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:14.620]
Yeah, this is the guy that called a couple days ago with the look up racy

[00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:16.160]

[00:40:17.540 --> 00:40:18.520]
about you know

[00:40:19.260 --> 00:40:23.220]
Sleep with the features. I had just something else you guys want me want to check when by the way

[00:40:23.220 --> 00:40:24.720]
I was right as if that was a comment

[00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:26.500]
I just thought I mentioned it again

[00:40:28.100 --> 00:40:32.340]
Couple days voice don't know from no godfather. What is it the only thing maybe

[00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:38.400]
George didn't look at the script well. I'm a rough. I say if I'm my doctor from Miami. I don't try to talk to us big English

[00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:45.680]
Michael Waxing racy to his wife got played in the casino, you know with the bingo and she took his hand

[00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:48.400]
And she said hello Mr. Paul, what the hell is that?

[00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:51.300]
Mr. Paul that's what she called him

[00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:56.560]
He called him Mr. Paul when he said hello to him and the last kill the man being what this dates, you know

[00:40:56.560 --> 00:40:58.820]
Okay, well, we'll find out. I know what he's talking about

[00:40:59.380 --> 00:41:04.920]
No, I don't I don't think should I should a quote with the first one was good. Oh now. Let's see. Oh look at this

[00:41:05.460 --> 00:41:12.240]
Bob Norman has new updated information on Joe Rose on his blog Bob Norman. You're a jackass. Okay, you're an idiot a jackass

[00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:20.880]
It says Joe Rose has been called in the principles office now. Who's this uh two and from and whatever it's an email to me from

[00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:25.700]
Someone who saw that on Bob Norman's blog and that central Joe Rose has been called in the principles office

[00:41:25.700 --> 00:41:32.140]
NBC6 to explain what he said in the last week about the deserability of black women whom he distinguishes red bones and chocolates or as Ray

[00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:33.560]
Negan would say chocolates

[00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:35.880]
It's gonna be a chocolate no Orleans

[00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:37.440]
Ray Negan knucklehead

[00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:43.740]
He's meeting today with stationing say this was the yesterday station executive about the comments to me last Wednesday on his radio show on seven

[00:41:43.740 --> 00:41:48.500]
I did a ticket according to Broward times supporter Elgin Jones who's dogging this case. He's dogganit

[00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:49.960]
He's bird dogganit

[00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:56.260]
Jones just now interviewed Larry McDaniel NBC6 vice president programming told him the station is looking at the matter that Rose was coming

[00:41:56.260 --> 00:42:02.740]
The office to explain what he meant when he said on the area prefer his red bones or lightskin black women at chocolates and that he understand most black men feel the same way

[00:42:02.740 --> 00:42:05.400]
I left a message with McDaniel the confirm it but I've nerd back from him

[00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:08.400]
But we don't even know who this is this. Oh, this is Bob Norman stuff

[00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:12.540]
While NBC6 is looking at the matter the tickets hiding under the bleachers on this story

[00:42:12.540 --> 00:42:16.280]
It hasn't returned numerous phone calls emails from Jones asking for comment which reporter

[00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:21.480]
Feeling you're left him a bit blistered when Tim hardaway made his comments about hating gay people on their station

[00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:26.400]
They blasted at every where he said but in this case they know who can return a phone call probably because it's much to do about nothing

[00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:27.160]
Bob Norman

[00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:30.860]
Rumors are still rumbling that similar roses co-workers are upset about the comments

[00:42:30.860 --> 00:42:33.100]
His boss as Jones happens to be a black woman

[00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:35.200]
So he really stepped into it into a bucket of stuff

[00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:40.500]
But should the former Ted NB can by NBC and were that often to be for being so idiotic? No, that would be wrong

[00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:44.520]
For one thing is audience other than Attorney Jack Thompson apparently wasn't offended by it

[00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:47.940]
Which is always the case Rose must not be real big in the black women demographic

[00:42:47.940 --> 00:42:52.720]
But he should definitely be made to apologize publicly for being such an insensitive bonehead says

[00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:57.800]
Bob Norman hey body out of apologize for being a bone and making a mountain out of a whole hill the idiot

[00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:04.260]
Pakistan police in Faratia are hunting a man who dug up his father's two-year-old corpse and took it home in a hijacked

[00:43:04.260 --> 00:43:06.800]
Andoans to try to bring him back to life all right

[00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:07.760]
Can't hurt

[00:43:08.980 --> 00:43:12.400]
Abdul Rahman's family says he's mentally ill never been able to cope with his father's death

[00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:18.300]
He dug up the corpse Thursday night after he had hijacked an ambulance and its driver at gunpoint and took it to his home

[00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:23.420]
Please raid the house on Friday after complaint from the trusted on the ambulance and were from ramen's brother

[00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:25.460]
I thought those were noodles ramen

[00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:33.500]
Yeah, remember noodles he kept the corpse which is uh nothing but a skeleton in his bedroom for well over 12 hours

[00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:36.060]
He escaped when we raided the house and we have buried it again

[00:43:36.060 --> 00:43:36.640]
They said

[00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:41.760]
Rossman also kidnapped a vagabond who slept in the graveyard and locked him up at home too. Well, maybe he's lonely

[00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:47.460]
He told us he saw Rossman chanting music spells and pouring rose water on the corpse to bring it back to life

[00:43:47.460 --> 00:43:51.640]
I was crying bitterly but we'll have thought and I come back for another round

[00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:53.940]
I'll be back to life for the back to life

[00:43:53.940 --> 00:43:56.300]
All the guest's are the crime they're all the public

[00:43:56.860 --> 00:43:57.340]
60s

[00:43:57.340 --> 00:43:58.480]
You A.M.

[00:43:58.540 --> 00:43:59.580]
No Roger's show

[00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:02.240]
This is your point

[00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:05.280]
Any questions?

[00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:08.220]
No

[00:44:12.660 --> 00:44:19.080]
The marines which now were playing it's time to change the station turn it off and turn on your right heart

[00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:19.660]
Absolutely

[00:44:19.660 --> 00:44:23.560]
Some stupid sport hold flags don't care about their jobs

[00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:26.020]
Are killing off the audience of ratings

[00:44:26.020 --> 00:44:28.700]
Right, I want a phase fall

[00:44:28.700 --> 00:44:32.020]
Back the brakes of me cash when your face fall

[00:44:32.020 --> 00:44:33.980]
Right here you're almost forced man

[00:44:33.980 --> 00:44:35.080]
It's U.A.M.

[00:44:35.180 --> 00:44:36.560]
This bad and short hold way

[00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:36.960]
A.M.

[00:44:37.580 --> 00:44:39.740]
Of hot newbies in the listeners

[00:44:39.740 --> 00:44:42.720]
They make your face fall

[00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:45.420]
I'm a chopper my f***er ass

[00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:47.440]
Right, Tom

[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:54.340]
They don't care if they just yet they program for their sisters with their nose embedded deeply in job straps

[00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:58.580]
They kiss each other's thighs while hobbling sport hold eyes

[00:44:58.580 --> 00:45:01.780]
And murdering the audience for only what they like

[00:45:01.780 --> 00:45:03.520]
It's Marlin's phase fall

[00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:07.040]
They're racing all our numbers Marlin's phase fall

[00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:08.880]
You can't get any dumber

[00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:11.680]
The management here don't give a crap what you think

[00:45:11.680 --> 00:45:12.340]
Boop

[00:45:12.340 --> 00:45:15.260]
They're busy filling out an athlete's pink

[00:45:15.780 --> 00:45:17.900]
Speak you days fall

[00:45:17.900 --> 00:45:20.340]
With all the sports crap

[00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:24.720]
You'd be a baby fall

[00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:27.400]
Back the brakes of forehold ass

[00:45:33.820 --> 00:45:35.640]
Good news that we have no ball game today

[00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:37.020]
Tomorrow though that's a big story

[00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:39.500]
Tomorrow we have the marlins of the car good story

[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.280]
1250 marks and other stories are good story man

[00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:43.820]
That's the only kind it's a good story

[00:45:44.460 --> 00:45:46.060]
I'm almost tempted to play this

[00:45:47.300 --> 00:45:48.180]
Hello Tom

[00:45:48.180 --> 00:45:48.400]

[00:46:23.860 --> 00:46:24.440]
Yeah

This is how to like a kick

[00:46:27.100 --> 00:46:29.100]
I don't know if you're saying what you're saying

[00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:30.740]
You're saying it's like a kick

[00:46:30.740 --> 00:46:32.760]
J-A-L-K-I-K

[00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:34.260]
This is my place

[00:46:34.940 --> 00:46:36.360]
Uh he's supposed to be there

[00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:36.840]
So this how

[00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:38.760]
It's like a kick

[00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:40.880]
J-A-L-I-K

[00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:44.560]
Everybody's name is like a kick

[00:46:45.140 --> 00:46:45.660]
How?

[00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:48.980]
Everybody's name is like a kick

[00:46:53.220 --> 00:46:54.640]
Everybody's name is like a kick

[00:46:55.460 --> 00:46:56.740]
Nobody by that name

[00:46:57.320 --> 00:46:57.760]
No

[00:46:57.760 --> 00:46:58.380]
Okay

[00:46:58.380 --> 00:46:58.880]
Not there

[00:46:58.880 --> 00:46:59.940]
Hell is what I could kick

[00:46:59.940 --> 00:47:01.440]
Okay 955 in a poll

[00:47:03.020 --> 00:47:04.480]
How about the mic is he there

[00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:05.860]
What we don't want to get into that too deeply

[00:47:05.860 --> 00:47:06.560]
No

[00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:09.220]
567-0560 at least I don't

[00:47:09.220 --> 00:47:11.720]
And pond 560 and he verized in singular wireless line

[00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:13.700]
Really said

[00:47:13.700 --> 00:47:14.960]
I remember I'm just bitterly disappointed

[00:47:14.960 --> 00:47:16.200]
I thought we had turned the corner

[00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:17.240]
We started on Monday

[00:47:17.240 --> 00:47:18.500]
And then yesterday we made a big

[00:47:18.500 --> 00:47:20.600]
I thought yesterday was just to find his wine

[00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:21.100]
You know

[00:47:21.100 --> 00:47:22.360]
I would even say

[00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:22.960]
Nice

[00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:23.420]
Yeah

[00:47:23.420 --> 00:47:24.340]
I would go that far

[00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:27.460]
But now today they're back like we've always said man

[00:47:27.460 --> 00:47:30.220]
Don't ever assume this audience can keep it going

[00:47:31.980 --> 00:47:33.060]
WDQ-A-M hello

[00:47:33.740 --> 00:47:36.520]
Emil did you know that Virginia City in Nevada

[00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:37.420]
Where you wrote

[00:47:37.420 --> 00:47:39.500]
You spoke about that earlier for you

[00:47:39.500 --> 00:47:42.960]
That's actually the opening scene of Bonanza

[00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:44.200]
Where the ponderosa is

[00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:45.880]
You know that burning map

[00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:52.300]

[00:47:52.300 --> 00:47:54.720]
Que pas co to gaunza no shuka baby

[00:47:55.500 --> 00:47:56.460]
WDQ-A-M hello

[00:47:56.460 --> 00:47:57.880]
Wish I heard

[00:47:59.380 --> 00:48:00.340]
567-0560

[00:48:00.340 --> 00:48:03.780]
pond 560 and he verized in singular wireless line

[00:48:04.420 --> 00:48:05.440]
WDQ-A-M hello

[00:48:08.500 --> 00:48:09.580]
Q-A-M

[00:48:10.340 --> 00:48:11.440]
guttable sound line

[00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:12.440]
I think it's Michael Jackson

[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:13.480]
Is that really

[00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:13.740]
Oh

[00:48:14.220 --> 00:48:14.700]
Yeah

[00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:19.020]
Okay, and that's it. That's the mother of what they got so I guess the pull is all

[00:48:19.020 --> 00:48:19.720]
complete

[00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:26.740]
Really it just it just boggles my mind there were times when I think there's no way that they're going to be adding on it

[00:48:26.740 --> 00:48:31.960]
You know we got everything that could possibly be on one and then all of a sudden I got one for the pull and now today

[00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:37.200]
When I thought that the originalist was really very weak, you know very weak extremely weak

[00:48:37.860 --> 00:48:41.240]
Maybe the pull question is very weak. I think it's just fine, you know

[00:48:41.740 --> 00:48:43.360]
I would say nice

[00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:49.560]
951 I'm 61 in a pull so make a thousand easy this hour but nevertheless maybe the busy voting on it

[00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:51.040]
WDQ-A-M hello

Yeah, but sometimes you know if you don't get your point across right away you can hung up on

[00:49:20.540 --> 00:49:23.260]

Go to the Marlon Brando main page there not too far from where the Weasemagel has that ugly look on his face

[00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:46.920]

[00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:51.740]
And uh right there on a very first post

[00:51:11.240 --> 00:51:13.180]
Um, maybe his head could fit in that orifice

[00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:15.440]
Maybe he's got a pinhead

[00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:18.940]
It's not for real and looking at I've seen that before heavy

[00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:22.120]
Not may not be for real, but it sure is cute sure. I'll give you a yes

[00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:27.700]
Iron Jeremy put on there why would anybody want to be that fat in that hairy? What's the point because you got lead a lot

[00:51:27.700 --> 00:51:33.100]

[00:51:45.880 --> 00:51:47.500]

OJ Simpson's live hour of the day committed those murders with a camera

[00:52:27.020 --> 00:52:27.420]
Hmm

[00:52:28.920 --> 00:52:32.540]
And there's only one problem with that that is if I could be somebody else for one day

[00:52:32.540 --> 00:52:37.920]
I would be not who would you want to have been like 80 million years ago when OJ murdered those two people in cold

[00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:44.420]
But but you continue like you always say they make the question and whatever they answer the question they want to answer whatever question that

[00:52:44.420 --> 00:52:51.380]
No first they come up with an answer and they create the question for right kind of like on that stupid show jeopardy that you like so much uh-huh

[00:52:52.780 --> 00:52:56.960]
They had some of the dumbest people on the real affordian last couple of nights that I've ever seen in my life

[00:52:56.960 --> 00:53:05.060]
You mean double the usual number the usual they had one guy in there and I think he had like about 10 grand on a line too and it was chocolate covered macadamia

[00:53:06.860 --> 00:53:09.200]
Something that whatever was well whatever was

[00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:12.040]
And he said chocolate covered macadamian

[00:53:12.740 --> 00:53:17.440]
Whatever what and on the end of it and there was no one there was no more letters there were no more letters

[00:53:18.620 --> 00:53:24.580]
And they had one last night and she was even almost as dumb as he was but there's a lot of dumb people out there probably mostly from Florida. I would think

[00:53:26.360 --> 00:53:29.580]
Here's the story of a football family

[00:53:30.060 --> 00:53:33.160]
That you'll get when you knew a lot of girls

[00:53:33.940 --> 00:53:36.380]
You can give your lady gold

[00:53:37.020 --> 00:53:41.180]
Or some diners but don't release your pearls

[00:53:41.900 --> 00:53:44.700]
Here's the story of that Tom Brady

[00:53:45.740 --> 00:53:48.740]
Who was busy giving every girl a bone

[00:53:49.340 --> 00:53:52.640]
Then one of them said he'll be a father

[00:53:53.180 --> 00:53:55.380]
But she was not far long

[00:53:56.380 --> 00:53:59.360]
Then came one day when Tom Brady went to cowboy

[00:54:00.220 --> 00:54:03.260]
And he knew too many times and said been touched

[00:54:03.900 --> 00:54:07.280]
Now he's just months away from a football family

[00:54:07.980 --> 00:54:10.840]
In pregnant when they wrote the Brady junk

[00:54:11.660 --> 00:54:12.740]
The Brady junk

[00:54:13.660 --> 00:54:14.660]
Tom Brady's fun

[00:54:15.380 --> 00:54:20.600]
Big as eight and all not tough by Brady's fun

[00:54:23.320 --> 00:54:32.280]
Nice 1116 at 560 WDQM 975 0 so to full make a thousand by I'm thinking maybe the bottom of the yard or surely they're after any interest

[00:54:32.280 --> 00:54:35.000]

[00:54:35.720 --> 00:54:38.720]
Yeah, Neil yeah, how you doing buddy good?

You know every once in a while you fire up that song short past fanny yeah

[00:54:43.580 --> 00:54:46.900]
Very ways. I'm gonna let you know that's the first record I ever bought when I move

[00:54:46.900 --> 00:54:51.420]
Yeah, well, you must be old like me. Yeah, a black record

[00:54:52.040 --> 00:54:54.360]
Yellow and white label with a big hole in the middle

[00:54:54.360 --> 00:54:56.020]
Echo echo records

[00:54:56.440 --> 00:55:01.000]
Just one let you know. Okay, good luck you pal. How you like that? That was marginally interesting

[00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:03.120]
That was the first record that he ever bought what he's a little keen

[00:55:04.260 --> 00:55:08.580]
Let me wait him to have a short back fanny man. I mean nothing like having a short back fanny

[00:55:10.020 --> 00:55:11.320]
Got like jandy to zero

[00:55:12.020 --> 00:55:15.980]
And we've got a fat fan, but it's short. Yeah, let's imagine it's that fanny

[00:55:18.380 --> 00:55:23.580]
Wonder how farmers fanny candies do I hate that that's bad stuff by the way anybody who goes out there is a candy freak

[00:55:23.580 --> 00:55:24.940]
Don't buy fanny farmer

[00:55:25.540 --> 00:55:27.500]
You know what that's very big it's big and Rochester

[00:55:27.500 --> 00:55:30.860]
I think that's where they make it and also in the Boston fanny farmer

[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:31.640]
Farmers fanny

[00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:34.680]
never see farmers fanny not lately

[00:55:36.420 --> 00:55:39.820]

Like that. That's not bad

[00:56:41.960 --> 00:56:51.400]
A girl's beloved dog in a grizzly nightmare written by Mary Lynn Smith and the Minneapolis St. Paul St. Archibune. This is a very sad story

[00:56:52.460 --> 00:56:58.420]
Crystal Brown's world was turned upside down a month ago when Chevy her four-year-old Australian shepherd mixed didn't come home

[00:56:58.420 --> 00:57:02.560]
What kind of a name is that for a dog anyway Chevy people made their dogs all kinds of stuff

[00:57:02.560 --> 00:57:04.100]
Pretty stupid name

[00:57:04.780 --> 00:57:10.080]
I told him everything and he never shared any of my secrets at crystal 17 who's had some trouble times in her young life

[00:57:10.080 --> 00:57:14.800]
Chevy was her therapy dog and she leaned on him for comfort and support. This is a very sad story

[00:57:15.800 --> 00:57:21.120]
Two weeks ago a gift wrapped box was left at the house where she lives with her grandmother in St. Paul's

[00:57:21.120 --> 00:57:25.680]
Rice street area inside the box crystal was horrified to find her dog's head

[00:57:27.440 --> 00:57:33.820]
This was so cruel crystal said this is one sick twisted person the incidents considered so shocking that the remains

[00:57:33.820 --> 00:57:38.080]
Society of the United States announced it's offering a reward of up to 25 hundred buss for information

[00:57:38.080 --> 00:57:39.260]
You have to an arrest and conviction

[00:57:40.620 --> 00:57:46.580]
Homicide investigators are looking into the case because of the implied terroristic threat St. Paul police are in jingray said a

[00:57:46.580 --> 00:57:48.920]
Terroristic threat I

[00:57:48.920 --> 00:57:53.840]
Didn't realize that the beheading the dog was a right I guess everything could be terrorism couldn't yeah

[00:57:53.840 --> 00:57:54.940]
You scared the hell out of me right now

[00:57:55.820 --> 00:57:59.040]
This was extraordinarily heinous said the El Bartlett the Humane Society

[00:57:59.040 --> 00:58:04.360]
Debbie Manjure for animal cruelty issues. I deal with hundreds and hundreds of cruelty cases each year when I read about this case

[00:58:04.360 --> 00:58:06.760]
It took my breath away. It's horrible. He said

[00:58:07.700 --> 00:58:13.180]
This case Bartlett said as far worse than a recent episode in Ash gosh, Wisconsin where a 49-year-old man

[00:58:13.180 --> 00:58:15.420]
Decapitated to his kittens because they were annoying

[00:58:17.260 --> 00:58:22.780]
Sending the dogs headed the teenager was a malicious act Bartlett said that level of the property is beyond belief surely brown

[00:58:22.780 --> 00:58:26.620]
Crystal's grandma said that Chevy wandered off after she let him out one night mid-Fibre

[00:58:27.840 --> 00:58:33.360]
Crystal peppered the neighborhood with missing posters and went door-to-door with two photos of Chevy and hopes that somebody had spotted him

[00:58:33.360 --> 00:58:38.280]
She rode the bus countless times to the St. Paul animal shelter and called there thousands of times she said

[00:58:38.280 --> 00:58:42.280]
I felt empty crystal said I couldn't talk to anyone who was my dog or was just me and him

[00:58:42.780 --> 00:58:43.980]
And a dog named Boo

[00:58:44.640 --> 00:58:45.080]
Well

[00:58:45.880 --> 00:58:46.660]
Who did that?

[00:58:46.980 --> 00:58:51.520]
Don't tell me very ugly guy too by the way. Mm-hmm. Because when you got it. Yeah. Yeah. That's right

[00:58:52.260 --> 00:58:53.500]
What is no no no?

[00:58:54.380 --> 00:58:57.060]
Here's a hint. It's a kind of dog Sorta

[00:58:59.240 --> 00:59:03.980]
It is Sorta. It's a kind of nine. I don't know. Lobo. Oh

[00:59:05.300 --> 00:59:05.740]
Lebia

[00:59:06.760 --> 00:59:07.640]
Excuse me

[00:59:07.640 --> 00:59:12.460]
Then Shirley Brown came home one day and found a box wrapped in red paper on her front steps with batteries taped to the box

[00:59:12.460 --> 00:59:16.480]
Congratulations, Crystal notes said this side off batteries included and it's sick

[00:59:16.940 --> 00:59:21.100]
Surely Brown placed the box on her granddaughters bedroom dresser. I was surprised and excited crystal said

[00:59:21.100 --> 00:59:22.640]
I thought it was a gift for my cousin

[00:59:23.200 --> 00:59:28.340]
She tore off the paper and ripped open the box inside. She found Valentine candy and a black garbage bag

[00:59:28.340 --> 00:59:30.000]
And then she saw her dogs face

[00:59:31.040 --> 00:59:36.900]
Crystal screamed and ran to the kitchen to find grandma is this my dog grandma? No, that's not my dog is it my dog? Mm-hmm

[00:59:37.920 --> 00:59:42.560]
Grace said investigate is believe the case is an isolated incident and the suspect knows the family

[00:59:42.560 --> 00:59:46.240]
We don't know what the motive would be Grace said. It's a terrible thing to do to somebody's pet

[00:59:46.800 --> 00:59:50.700]
Anybody with information regarding the case? I mean, I well we're not gonna give out phone numbers for the same fault

[00:59:50.700 --> 00:59:55.280]
Police Chevy crystal said was the best Frenchie ever had he was more patient than any person I ever met

[00:59:55.280 --> 00:59:57.680]
That dog waited for years for me to get myself together

[00:59:57.680 --> 01:00:01.340]
So crystal then of course began to cry and get shy and who can blame her

[01:00:01.340 --> 01:00:03.760]
That dog didn't care what I did what I didn't do

[01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:07.660]
But anyone did to me he didn't care about anyway. I just wanted to love me the way I loved him

[01:00:08.620 --> 01:00:11.580]
Crystal's got a new puppy now another Australian shepherd that she's named diesel

[01:00:12.500 --> 01:00:19.640]
The puppies know Chevy not yet anyway. Hopefully he'll be my best friend crystal said hopefully he'll be my guide through life crystal and diesel

[01:00:21.020 --> 01:00:24.500]
Let's hope now let me ask you if crystal turns out to be a lesbian

[01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:29.840]
With that make diesel a diesel. Oh, no, I don't even go there. Okay, well

[01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:32.100]
I won't go there

[01:00:32.100 --> 01:00:36.800]
98 and the pole by the bottom of the air will have a thousand. There's Bob Barwood at stupid mustache

[01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:38.820]
What a silly person man?

[01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:40.820]
By Mr. Bush himself

[01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:44.100]
But it would be a bit about 991 on the pole now

[01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:50.820]
5670560 pound 560 in the Verizon singular wireless line WQA and hello

[01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:53.120]
How you doing there? Okay, sir

[01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:57.340]
Uh, I would like to kill a comic for Christ today. Okay, well go ahead

[01:00:58.160 --> 01:01:03.780]
Why do I don't get a couple of them kill a comic for Christ kill somebody for Jesus man the more religious you are

[01:01:03.780 --> 01:01:05.760]
Let me tell you right now. This is the true test

[01:01:06.220 --> 01:01:08.560]
The true test of how religious you really are

[01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:12.500]
Is whether we can really get you to go out there in in radio land

[01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:17.220]
I'll find it and just kill some people that's right and the more you kill more religious you must be

[01:01:17.620 --> 01:01:20.720]
Because that's what religion is do better than anything else kill some people

[01:01:22.580 --> 01:01:24.160]

Hello, I'd like to be Henry Barrow and sit some wine in the dolphin press box all day long. Okay, Henry and by the way

[01:12:03.860 --> 01:12:06.040]
Put the food down put down the chow Henry

[01:12:06.040 --> 01:12:08.420]
I wonder if he ever lost any weight that that was

[01:12:09.320 --> 01:12:12.520]
I hate to say because Henry you know, we always liked him Henry's a good guy

[01:12:12.520 --> 01:12:18.780]
But that was discussing that day he came in we hadn't seen Henry used to be the news director WI would do 100 years ago when we worked there

[01:12:19.320 --> 01:12:22.520]
I was with a pretty good guy and he was like a little guy, you know

[01:12:22.650 --> 01:12:25.870]
Kind of funny looking I didn't say that I was

[01:12:25.870 --> 01:12:29.910]
Immediately looking for that thing in here and of course it only takes about two seconds. Oh

[01:12:29.910 --> 01:12:34.930]
He's a little guy kind of funny look actually kind of very distinguished looking now would say when you say with a must-a-ash

[01:12:34.930 --> 01:12:40.530]
That's right this thing which you know snapping always with the suit on you know the whole deal didn't look like a wine swilling drug at all

[01:12:40.530 --> 01:12:48.090]
No, all he was and then he came into QAM there several years ago got a very very abriant and hot young daughter

[01:12:48.090 --> 01:12:51.750]
What's he's not so young anymore, but brilliant nice nice young lady

[01:12:52.750 --> 01:12:58.210]
But to make a long story short he had ballooned up to like you know, he was still like about four feet tall but weighed about 600 pounds

[01:12:58.210 --> 01:13:01.250]
It was a disheartening to see that

[01:13:01.250 --> 01:13:06.710]
But yeah, when you get a lot of free wine and the wine tasting then you get the cheese and the crackers and more wine and all other

[01:13:07.850 --> 01:13:10.950]
Whatever just ballooned up, but that's what the business will do to you

[01:13:12.210 --> 01:13:18.530]
It was just to take your insides and just twist them like twisted cookies. We do have that though. Don't we?

[01:13:19.170 --> 01:13:21.250]
Twist the police. I got some right now

[01:13:31.570 --> 01:13:39.990]
Yeah, when you work in this business you'll get twisted kiffies me if there's no extra charge for that

[01:13:39.990 --> 01:13:41.170]
There's no surcharge sir

[01:13:42.070 --> 01:13:44.290]

You don't seem all whipped up about that oh yeah

[01:14:40.230 --> 01:14:47.050]
The house committee investing in the firing of U.S. Attorneys by the Justice Department authorize the issuing of subpoenas of top aids to

[01:14:47.050 --> 01:14:50.970]
President Bush today in a voice vote. They stopped sure to visually subpoenas themselves

[01:14:50.970 --> 01:14:56.370]
The motion passed to authorize the chairman of wishing subpoena said a spokesperson for our judiciary committee chairman John

[01:14:56.370 --> 01:15:02.250]
Connures a statement on the authorization will soon be forthcoming. Well, there's swillery on your TV said oh

[01:15:02.250 --> 01:15:09.070]
Interesting. Oh my gosh. He's got the personality of a dead boofo toe man. She is weak weak. Oh

[01:15:09.070 --> 01:15:14.950]
God look at her she's like she looks like Larry King and drag all hunched up like that. But she wears suspenders

[01:15:15.790 --> 01:15:20.410]
You think that wouldn't surprise me and she definitely ain't got any boobs. I'll say to that

[01:15:21.030 --> 01:15:26.230]
The authorization provided for subpoenas to secure testimony to hearing and to obtain documents from these individuals as well

[01:15:26.230 --> 01:15:28.030]
As unre-dacted documents

[01:15:28.870 --> 01:15:32.470]
Unredacted from the Department of Justice and White House pursuant to the committee's investigation

[01:15:32.470 --> 01:15:37.130]

Samson Carl Rove Harry admirers William Kelly and Scott Jennings

[01:15:41.690 --> 01:15:46.590]
About a beep bit a boop bit about we will not necessarily issue the subpoenas immediately send aid in the email to raw

[01:15:46.590 --> 01:15:55.490]
Story we're trying to do what we can to avoid that but the vote will offer the possibility the possibility that the White House will definitely choose to stone wall and slow walk the investigation

[01:15:55.970 --> 01:16:01.250]
But a beep bit a boop but a boop but a boop. In other words, how many times did they have to lie before they all wind up and jailed together?

[01:16:01.550 --> 01:16:06.890]
How much more of this BS do we have to listen to before everybody gets a free gigantic shak-tobody on and gets laid

Herburell this is on the MSNBC website by the way

[01:16:49.950 --> 01:16:54.530]
So you think that it would be much less to suggestive and much less grotesque in which case we wouldn't care

[01:16:55.330 --> 01:16:59.470]
Authorities have in recent years taken a harder line on the flesh trade prompting operators to come up with an increasing

[01:16:59.470 --> 01:17:04.810]
Variety of services aimed at providing pleasure but circulating the long arm of the law

[01:17:04.810 --> 01:17:07.010]
Well, how can you have any pleasure if you don't have a long arm

[01:17:07.870 --> 01:17:13.790]
Right the mud pack for the penis which follows a wine bath for the go nads is part of an Italian style aesthetic treatment offered by a

[01:17:13.790 --> 01:17:16.050]
Tokyo based service called the arrow money

[01:17:16.790 --> 01:17:21.270]
Sounds to not the sounds those sounds Japanese to me sounds Italian huh? Adamani

[01:17:21.810 --> 01:17:25.970]
Sounds so schmaltsy a whole lot of operations similar to ours bring up an insure term

[01:17:25.970 --> 01:17:30.590]
We need to provide a service nobody else was offering and this was it the Adamani boss tells spa

[01:17:31.090 --> 01:17:37.670]
Our sales point is that we also offer variations including having the service performed by multiple workers groups of two or three women

[01:17:37.670 --> 01:17:42.530]
Or he can have it performed by a shy woman or another one who'll be talking dirty while she's doing it

[01:17:43.710 --> 01:17:45.010]
Oh, what the shia

[01:17:45.010 --> 01:17:45.290]
one

[01:17:46.070 --> 01:17:49.090]
The arrow money's I'm out of shia woman who's talking dirty

[01:17:49.610 --> 01:17:54.270]
The arrow money's boss as the service began with a motto of providing health and beauty to the willian anus

[01:17:58.850 --> 01:18:00.870]
Yeah, that sounds real Japanese doesn't

[01:18:03.050 --> 01:18:10.250]
Willianus I do that guy what time will you with one of you the service involves using a hotel sink or face washing basin

[01:18:10.250 --> 01:18:13.110]
Fill you with warm water and wine try the wine

[01:18:13.650 --> 01:18:20.610]
This is aimed at improving the circulation instead of inserting the face in there and however the client places their bottom in the bowl

[01:18:21.090 --> 01:18:23.750]
Allowing the penis and anus to be stuck in the studs of their

[01:18:24.490 --> 01:18:24.970]
Semoye

[01:18:28.150 --> 01:18:33.050]
Oh come on that's French no kidding. No, it's Japanese

[01:18:33.830 --> 01:18:39.530]
Spine notes that the washing is performed by at least one woman who the Adamani insist must be in her 20s or 30s at the oldest

[01:18:40.250 --> 01:18:41.190]
once the basic

[01:18:42.070 --> 01:18:48.350]
Basin finished as finished the genitals are swathed in a chunk of mud supposedly to cleanse the skin

[01:18:48.930 --> 01:18:54.650]
Once they're completely covered the woman or a woman providing the service then they show their handiwork so to speak

[01:18:55.470 --> 01:18:57.330]
Oh, wait a minute. I can't read this

[01:18:58.410 --> 01:19:05.730]
Well, I'll read it until the client reaches climax or what spot calls the ascent to heaven. Yeah, well that sounds odd about

[01:19:05.730 --> 01:19:08.170]
Discribable that sounds very sexual to me is what it sounds like

[01:19:08.970 --> 01:19:15.790]
Hmm sound like some kind of a whole house to make it is what it sounds like. I thought there was like something really uh, you know

[01:19:15.790 --> 01:19:18.550]
What different gonna happen? It's just sound like you know

[01:19:19.150 --> 01:19:24.670]
Just just a different way of achieving the same old means you're all the way. Oh sitting sitting in the sink is something to think

[01:19:24.670 --> 01:19:26.730]
Sitting in the sink and why would I think?

I don't know maybe they want to be balding into over with and have done such a horrendous job filling in on the stern show on terrestrial radio like David Lee growth. Oh, I'm sorry

[01:29:28.430 --> 01:29:29.750]
WQ I am hello

[01:29:30.690 --> 01:29:31.950]
Marty Snyder died

[01:29:32.750 --> 01:29:33.150]

Welcome

[01:29:38.870 --> 01:29:44.190]
5 6 7 the actually Marty Snyder committed he tried once and several years before and failed

[01:29:44.190 --> 01:29:46.410]
And now I guess he thought it was such a good idea to try it again

[01:29:46.410 --> 01:29:51.790]
That's a terrible thing to say because he was a good kid, but he's not a good kid anymore. He's not even a good old guy anymore

[01:29:52.530 --> 01:29:57.830]
And like I told you and my friend Dave from Rochester came up last was it last year the year before I don't know

With his girlfriend Ginny too people are with the high school with them

[01:30:02.050 --> 01:30:05.890]
I mean, you know they looked okay. It's not like they looked like they were from a cemetery village

[01:30:05.890 --> 01:30:07.470]
But old you know old

[01:30:08.110 --> 01:30:13.410]

[01:30:13.410 --> 01:30:14.390]

[01:30:15.050 --> 01:30:17.690]

[01:30:25.930 --> 01:30:28.750]
And pound 5 60 in the Verizon singular wireless line

[01:30:29.690 --> 01:30:30.690]
WQ I am hello

[01:30:33.670 --> 01:30:35.910]

[01:30:35.910 --> 01:30:40.650]

[01:30:42.650 --> 01:30:43.610]

[01:30:44.850 --> 01:30:49.990]
Put him on the bowl pretty ugly guy put him on a put him on the pole is that a directivess sir

[01:30:50.390 --> 01:30:51.610]
Then on the pole

[01:30:52.670 --> 01:30:57.270]
Not the floor the pole on the flow and put your ass on the floor you idiot

[01:30:57.730 --> 01:31:02.390]
Put him on the pole that's like that one guy you know we put up with it from him because that guy's funny put him on there

[01:31:02.390 --> 01:31:05.210]
You know who is the guy that he was always talking about

[01:31:05.770 --> 01:31:07.270]
Frankie lineman. Yeah

[01:31:08.330 --> 01:31:13.250]
You can be Frankie lineman for one day. I will he probably don't smell too good anymore. He's been dead for a very long time

[01:31:13.810 --> 01:31:16.290]
5 6 and this is my last time I'm giving these numbers out

[01:31:16.290 --> 01:31:20.770]
Then I'm going to revert to back to my pole because this whole concept of mine. I think it's really great

[01:31:20.770 --> 01:31:22.910]
The only problem is that these people are in a coma

[01:31:24.550 --> 01:31:24.910]
I

[01:31:24.910 --> 01:31:30.170]
Thought I thought once upon a time in America way back in the I&Z days when I dropped all the boring guests

[01:31:30.170 --> 01:31:32.630]
And I went to a totally different format, you know, mm-hmm

[01:31:33.150 --> 01:31:36.170]
And I never gave the numbers out. I would just come in and sit down every day in the phone

[01:31:36.170 --> 01:31:39.490]
Be just ringing off the hook. I never had to give the numbers out for a very long time

[01:31:39.870 --> 01:31:44.150]
Those are the days my friend. That's what Mary Popkin said those are the days

[01:31:44.970 --> 01:31:49.330]

[01:35:18.810 --> 01:35:22.690]
It's been so long. I don't know when they were on the on that fake surf station. They would call you during the show

[01:35:22.690 --> 01:35:25.070]
It don't sure how you're doing another radio

[01:35:25.070 --> 01:35:28.430]
Doctor radio drifter than nobody ever heard of the other stalkers man

[01:35:28.970 --> 01:35:31.150]
They think that they're talkers, but they're really stalkers

[01:35:33.010 --> 01:35:36.890]
Get done sure what on it and didn't she sound like a sarcotic bitch huh?

[01:35:36.990 --> 01:35:41.690]
Oh, you don't know the radio over there and uh, yeah on the radio over here

[01:35:41.690 --> 01:35:46.250]
We're on the radio over here and you're not honey. And either was done sure what I rather put reberter sure

[01:35:46.250 --> 01:35:51.150]
What on especially for you? I've actually chicken echo Marisa. That was her theme song reberter sure

[01:35:51.150 --> 01:35:53.710]
She had a 15 minute show. She tinkled on the panel

[01:35:54.850 --> 01:35:55.250]
I

[01:35:55.250 --> 01:35:59.630]
Wish a lot of people would like to see a show these days with some you know some celebrity who would tinkle on the panel

[01:35:59.630 --> 01:36:02.330]
But anyway, no thanks. That's not much that especially for you

[01:36:03.150 --> 01:36:08.330]
That's what I'm here for and don sure what put them on here. Are you crazy person or what honey? Are you crazy?

[01:36:08.850 --> 01:36:10.310]
Jesus god and Joseph

[01:36:11.150 --> 01:36:17.530]
No wonder people turned a religion with crap like that going around like some kind of a disease like a disease in your radio

[01:36:17.530 --> 01:36:20.910]
We got a disease in our transmitter. It's freaking done sure with disease

[01:36:21.470 --> 01:36:24.630]
We would cope before we put down sure what on here. How do you like that honey?

[01:36:25.450 --> 01:36:28.570]
And so what everybody else which is why he couldn't buy his way out of here

[01:36:28.570 --> 01:36:31.330]
He had a million dollars a minute. He couldn't buy his way on here

[01:36:31.330 --> 01:36:35.450]
Whoever the hell he is the god your breasts are beautiful several days ago

[01:36:35.450 --> 01:36:42.950]
I commented briefly on some recent statements that have been made by some members of congress about Iraq and it's important to make this point

[01:36:43.470 --> 01:36:44.150]
At the outset

[01:36:45.110 --> 01:36:46.810]
The president of the United States

[01:36:46.810 --> 01:36:51.170]
Purposely misled the American people on pre-war intelligence

[01:36:52.010 --> 01:36:58.650]
American soldiers and Marines serving in Iraq go out every day into some of the most dangerous and unpredictable conditions

[01:36:59.450 --> 01:37:03.810]
These brave Americans were sent into battle for a deliberate falsehood

[01:37:04.410 --> 01:37:08.810]
pre-war information was distorted to corrupt the oil for food program

[01:37:09.770 --> 01:37:13.330]
There is no denying that the president lied to the American people

[01:37:13.890 --> 01:37:17.110]
This is revisionism of the most corrupt and shameless variety

[01:37:17.810 --> 01:37:19.170]
It's also something I enjoy

[01:37:19.970 --> 01:37:26.210]
It's one of the reasons I've stayed in the business and I believe the feeling is probably the same for most of us in public life

[01:37:26.930 --> 01:37:32.210]
The president and his administration hate our country and hate the liberties for which we stand

[01:37:33.010 --> 01:37:39.930]
They dwell in the shadows have no regard for the laws of warfare and feel unconstrained by any standard of morality

[01:37:40.670 --> 01:37:44.730]
The president of the United States is dishonest and reprehensible

[01:37:45.170 --> 01:37:47.750]
And none of us should want it any other way

[01:37:47.750 --> 01:37:49.150]
Thank you very much

[01:37:49.150 --> 01:37:52.410]
Some of these were going to be a click of leading term with everything in justice

[01:37:52.410 --> 01:37:56.650]
For what we stand up to stand on this young Ponzi. Whatever you were saying right

[01:37:57.430 --> 01:37:59.930]
So what was that deal that we had just before the atop of the hour?

[01:37:59.930 --> 01:38:01.630]
There's something about anybody want to uh

[01:38:01.630 --> 01:38:04.290]
Consort with Henry Burrow's daughter and they said sure would

[01:38:04.950 --> 01:38:07.090]
Sure, what they were saying that must have been it

[01:38:07.090 --> 01:38:11.710]
Yeah, because nobody would enter right mind would call say hey put on sure what all the air Neil huh?

[01:38:11.910 --> 01:38:13.010]
It's really talk about the

[01:38:13.790 --> 01:38:14.910]
epitome of desperation

[01:38:15.650 --> 01:38:21.190]
That's have to have like a pim a female pim who calls the show now and she called before because I forget all she's called

[01:38:21.190 --> 01:38:22.570]
Clarence. She's called the voicemail

[01:38:22.570 --> 01:38:25.690]
I saved the voicemails because they're ridiculous and insane and comical yeah

[01:38:26.090 --> 01:38:30.250]
Pretending to be a producer and it's got to be his wife or his daughter or something like that because he's in the background

[01:38:30.250 --> 01:38:34.910]
You hear him in the back. I'm approaching yelling at each other and all this stuff

[01:38:36.030 --> 01:38:38.730]
The man's like a hundred from the sound of him. Yeah

[01:38:39.530 --> 01:38:39.890]
Yeah

[01:38:40.430 --> 01:38:44.130]
It's just for me you're gonna get that guy from my own new house is named the guy from Boston

[01:38:45.630 --> 01:38:47.930]
Do you remember that old fart from Boston?

[01:38:48.270 --> 01:38:49.210]
The poop oh

[01:38:49.210 --> 01:38:51.370]
Oh, I thought you were talking about from the rock group but

[01:38:52.490 --> 01:38:58.010]
That was Larry justice justice. That's right for justice. We must go to see Don Corleon. Larry justice

[01:38:58.990 --> 01:39:03.110]
He couldn't face the fact that they can't even got him off the ear because of the fact that he's stuck on here

[01:39:03.110 --> 01:39:06.810]
Not that he was a hundred years old nobody cared about that if he was a hundred and could have gotten an audience

[01:39:06.810 --> 01:39:08.870]
They'd have kissed his fat ass, but they didn't

[01:39:10.130 --> 01:39:11.030]
WDQ-AM hello

[01:39:32.450 --> 01:39:34.150]

Didn't seem to be fine as wine. Yeah for a while there, but they can't do it. They haven't got it in them

[01:39:59.330 --> 01:40:00.210]

[01:40:38.050 --> 01:40:44.930]
The fact that the election was fixed in 2004 and Ohio I've read 80 million stories about this. Does anybody out there care about any of them? No of course not

Sgooter a Arden

[01:46:13.430 --> 01:46:18.370]
If you will, a presidential favor, dirt-backed Barton.

[01:46:19.210 --> 01:46:23.930]
Let him off with a small fine, a little treason.

[01:46:24.190 --> 01:46:26.990]
Now, as far as I'm concerned, is it all right?

[01:46:28.330 --> 01:46:31.690]
You can do what Clinton did for his buddy, Mark Rich.

[01:46:32.110 --> 01:46:36.430]
But we can't wait until you're done, so I am there for you.

[01:46:36.430 --> 01:46:41.130]
Must beg your Barton, you've got to give, which are li-y-a- Barton.

[01:46:41.130 --> 01:46:45.230]
I could give a big crap of agent's dire-live.

[01:46:45.690 --> 01:46:51.110]
I have extracted my red drip fusion on Joe Wilson and Valerie Blame.

[01:46:52.190 --> 01:46:54.310]
And, uh, Robin, no back, I'm what?

[01:46:54.650 --> 01:46:56.090]
They have yet to be blamed.

[01:46:57.110 --> 01:47:00.870]
Ah, in case I have to bid the D.U. like Spiro Agnew,

[01:47:01.310 --> 01:47:05.130]
when they appoint a special prosecutor by committee, who get me out.

[01:47:05.950 --> 01:47:09.910]
Well then, you know what I'm talking about.

[01:47:09.910 --> 01:47:18.350]
I may be in decent and cold-hearted, but take my advice before Horsoon parted.

[01:47:18.810 --> 01:47:25.850]
Appropriate inside a hardened spest as you can, if you will, give Scooter a pardon.

[01:47:26.790 --> 01:47:34.770]
Okay, or else we're going to have impeachment problems, and put another past crack down before I have another hardened.

[01:47:40.890 --> 01:47:43.710]
From 32, 28 to 1 at 5, 60 W.Q. M.

[01:47:43.750 --> 01:47:49.690]
So, like I said, I thought we really turned a little bit of a corner there, and now all of a sudden I realize I'm staring off into space realizing,

[01:47:50.030 --> 01:47:51.310]
but I'm deluding myself.

[01:47:51.950 --> 01:47:56.430]
Bob Fattrakis and Harvey Wasserman write, in a bull move to restore treacherous elections in Ohio,

[01:47:56.910 --> 01:48:03.190]
Ohio's newly elected secretary of state Jennifer Brunner has requested the resignation of all four members of the Cairoga County Board of Elections.

[01:48:03.670 --> 01:48:09.370]
The two Democrats and two Republicans were formally asked to resign by the close of business on March 21, which sounds like today.

[01:48:10.170 --> 01:48:16.530]
Cairoga County includes the heavily democratic city of Cleveland, Brunner's a Democrat who was elected to Ohio as a secretary of state of November 2006.

[01:48:17.530 --> 01:48:24.870]
felony convictions have also resolved in 18-month prison sentences for two employees of the Cairoga B.O.E. as a result of what the county prosecutor in the case calls,

[01:48:25.190 --> 01:48:29.290]
the ringing of the outcome in the recount following the 2004 presidential election.

[01:48:30.290 --> 01:48:38.890]
Further problems surfaced in the conduct of Cairoga County's May 2006 primary, in a wake of which Michael Hu executive director of the county's Board of Elections recently also resigned and did.

[01:48:39.790 --> 01:48:48.670]
Intended in the shake up in Ohio's biggest county reflects a widening storm surrounding the outcome of the 2004 presidential election and the conduct of elections over all the nation's most pivotal state.

[01:48:51.010 --> 01:48:57.550]
Among those Brunner's answer to resign is Cairoga County Board of Elections chairman Robert Bennett, who chairs Ohio as Republican party.

[01:48:57.550 --> 01:49:05.630]
Bennett responded to Brunner by saying that he refused to resign. He's placed the blame for the May 2006 primary problems on private voting machine vendors, including die-bold.

[01:49:06.110 --> 01:49:12.750]
Bennett claims the ringing of the 2004 presidential recount was caused by the Cairoga County prosecutors office according to Columbus Dispatch.

[01:49:13.070 --> 01:49:20.890]
To make a long story short, the election was stolen. Anybody here? No. Any interest? No. No. Well, we already know that. Any anybody here give a crap? No. No.

[01:49:23.330 --> 01:49:27.770]
56670560. That's why it's pointless for me to sit here and read that whole entire thing. It's pointless. Right.

[01:49:28.750 --> 01:49:38.110]
Even you say that. That's right. They just don't care. What's that got to do with dancing with the stars? And this poll here looks like it's frozen. I could be wrong. Yeah, 1048.

[01:49:39.110 --> 01:49:46.370]
Are we still on the air? Are we getting ready to do a Marlon game or what? One, oh, four, eight. It's been stuck there for like, I don't know.

[01:49:46.370 --> 01:50:08.430]
I feel like I'm in suspended animation like very keen. Uh-huh. WDQAM. Hello. QAM. No changes. No changes. OK. Thanks, Don. That was done. That was done. I was done. I followed all the folks. Played back. That's it. That's the end of the cause. That's the end of the votes on the polls.

[01:50:08.430 --> 01:50:33.730]
I think it's time to like fold up our tent and go home. That's right. I'm at home. 5. Why? It's just to show that I'm dilucery. I'm an idiot. I'm a lunatic. I'm a loser.

We're offering you a four hour lighting round, but you're to stupid to do it. Don't know how to do it. WDQAM. Hello. Hey, I was wondering if you guys ever checked out a movie called Chumscrubber. No, what? Chumscrubber. It's about these parents in the kid that's a

[01:51:04.010 --> 01:51:32.550]
lot of people. I don't really seem to get a well in reality. I'd get the cameras in my house. Yeah, they don't belong with reality. I'm starting to relate to that right now, man. We got a new reality. I have no idea what's going on. I have like an out of body experience. I'm going to go out and lay on the patio here for a few minutes during the next hour. WDQAM. Hello. Yes, sir. Yes, I said a question for you. You can hear both spots. WDQAM. Hello.

[01:51:35.570 --> 01:52:02.530]
WDQAM. Hello. I fell as great show. How's it going? Okay. So I just got back to a list of the radio. Did you resolve that? Because I think you guys had a late night recording of the early show, something like a triple cast or something that I was asking about before. Then we resolve what? You know, the guy said that you played recording of the show later. But what does that mean? Did we resolve it? Like there was some kind of a dilemma going on?

[01:52:02.530 --> 01:52:11.510]
What does that mean? I don't know about it a little, but I just wanted to find out if you guys clarified that. Clarify this. Yeah, exactly.

[01:52:15.590 --> 01:52:28.190]
Smoky. See, now we're starting to cook a little bit again. Somebody turned off the damn stove. Oh, I farted. Just now. Maybe that hell will that damn might do it, man. Maybe we can get enough. Maybe like sterno. You know, did you hear it? I smelled it. I'll try louder than that. No, please.

You know, I had to tell Chris that story. Oh, God. I'm not certain. He believes it. It's a truth. It's true. I believe it. It's a scary. It is scary. She's scary. Q.A.M. Hello.

[01:54:02.130 --> 01:54:12.110]
Now we're talking. You know, that almost almost makes me want to play. Well, I will play it because you thought I still had that in here, but I never had it until you see me that disc.

[01:54:12.730 --> 01:54:20.250]
Was that the gravely? It's not rich. They want to. Okay. I think we got the limit. Get a little bit more compression. Go.

[01:54:20.450 --> 01:54:35.770]
Yeah. The little empty. Him also. Grab. I got five. Hey, 75 degrees in the magic city. Hey, we're broadcasting life. Hold on a second. Let me, let me stop out of over 75 degrees in the magic city.

[01:54:35.770 --> 01:54:46.690]
Heels of a great song. Oh, we already got down. Come on down with it. We're going to get down to that. We're going to dread. Grouply. It's the right time. What the hell about talking about?

[01:54:50.050 --> 01:55:05.170]
Yeah, you better check with Eric, man, because we still got a thousand 48 votes on the poll. There's something really something really stinks in here, man. Oh, I must have been what you did before. Hey, I got a lot of. I'm serious. I'm not joking. A thousand 48. How is that possible? We went nine minutes without another vote on the poll.

[01:55:05.170 --> 01:55:08.190]
And everything seems to be like all frozen up like we're in the North Pole.

[01:55:08.410 --> 01:55:09.330]
Get Ricky a blow.

[01:55:12.490 --> 01:55:16.730]
And our life from Rachel seven. It's the neo-Hudger show.

[01:55:21.090 --> 01:55:28.130]
I like to appear on the song for the party. The deal time likely about a good pie thing.

[01:55:28.130 --> 01:55:38.130]
Well, we're the guys. Oh, I don't think I'll be this is my favorite. I love the way that I'm being ended.

[01:55:38.830 --> 01:55:46.850]
The bitch haven't been the same since. The dog got by and died. I know. I know. I had to with some party. Gregory.

[01:55:47.350 --> 01:55:56.470]
Yeah, but then I didn't go much advancing. Of course it's not easy flying back there from Rachel seven. I know. Thank God.

[01:55:57.050 --> 01:56:07.350]
I'm here. It's all over for you. Push left stuck on earth. Yes, it didn't know well. Well, if you're lucky that crack head is the last bus to rig an election.

[01:56:07.570 --> 01:56:09.410]
Who's on this line? Don't we?

[01:56:09.730 --> 01:56:12.950]
Mr. Rogers speaking. I was in the public.

[01:56:13.130 --> 01:56:14.250]
So galactica today.

[01:56:14.770 --> 01:56:21.210]
Sir and let me tell you the clip out coupons in Thursday's paper under shaving.

[01:56:21.210 --> 01:56:30.070]
I discovered to my son. I know. It's not too for 99 cents on the contrary.

[01:56:30.070 --> 01:56:37.750]
Got them all. Two break stones for 99 cents. Now I don't know about you. That's right.

[01:56:37.750 --> 01:56:44.550]
I tried to pedal me two break stones for the price of two break stones cottage cheese when the coupon clearly stated.

[01:56:44.550 --> 01:56:50.750]
Well, use the cottage cheese that's grown in your toenails. Now who's this line? Seven and nine?

[01:56:51.390 --> 01:56:53.730]
Klingon penal colony. Hello. I forgot internet.

[01:56:53.870 --> 01:56:54.750]
Green tires.

[01:56:55.050 --> 01:57:02.390]
No. Okay. And that note. You know, I got a ring. Of course you hate my contract. How about a one minute show? Huh?

[01:57:02.830 --> 01:57:07.010]
You can fill the other three minutes. That's right. I'll count you by any next.

[01:57:07.910 --> 01:57:08.990]
George. Bye.

[01:57:11.330 --> 01:57:16.050]
Okay. 1246. So Christopher your online buddy there is he says down sure what is dead.

[01:57:17.310 --> 01:57:22.570]
Well, obviously they're thinking of a different one. Well, that's what he said. He Wikipedia that and I try to.

[01:57:22.610 --> 01:57:29.930]
There's a politician down sure went on there and it said radio. What is Jackie in whatever? Huh? Well, obviously this down sure would is using a fake name.

[01:57:31.070 --> 01:57:34.430]
How do you know that? Well, I don't know. People on the radio have a fake name.

[01:57:34.430 --> 01:57:40.010]
All we heard was from some broad that keeps calling and talking about Don Sherwood. That doesn't mean he's still alive. She can be say Abe Lincoln.

[01:57:40.410 --> 01:57:45.390]
I got a voicemail from Don Sherwood. You did? How long ago? Like last month? Yeah.

[01:57:46.350 --> 01:57:52.990]
Don. Yeah. Say what? What did he? What is he wants? What's he doing on the show? He wants to muscle in on the show.

[01:57:53.090 --> 01:57:58.730]
What does that mean? Sit it on the show? What does that mean? Sit it on the show? I want to sit in a chair. He wants to be your sidekick.

[01:57:59.150 --> 01:58:06.750]
Yeah, kick this. Okay. Back down. Anthony says your biggest fan. Anthony who has facts before and whatever.

[01:58:07.130 --> 01:58:12.170]
How about putting Paraseltan onto this pool? No. Anthony says I think it would be a lot of fun to be here.

[01:58:12.270 --> 01:58:16.130]
Well, how much dressing up like her Anthony and see what everybody says and get a needle nose like her.

[01:58:16.910 --> 01:58:20.190]
So Anthony or biggest fan? Hey, Anthony, get some help before it's too late.

[01:58:20.750 --> 01:58:23.950]
So we did get a big chunk of votes given on the pool in between something happened.

[01:58:23.950 --> 01:58:28.130]
In 2016, when maybe Eric pulled the maybe he had the freeze on that thing. You know?

[01:58:28.910 --> 01:58:35.190]
Remember Mr. Freeze? George Rodriguez has got two votes now. They want you, man. WDQA and Hello.

[01:58:35.830 --> 01:58:39.990]
Yeah, you get time for a real ball or? Well, well try and score it. And if we ever get one.

[01:58:40.530 --> 01:58:48.430]
You know, I'm not the kind of person who wishes other people to die. But when Dick Cheney went to the hospital yesterday,

[01:58:48.430 --> 01:58:52.790]
I said, I don't you wish that he would just croak right away. Yes.

[01:58:55.430 --> 01:59:00.490]
I hate to say it. But with that, I'm going to say you hate to say you don't hate to say it.

[01:59:00.510 --> 01:59:04.310]
That's not a super expression. I hate to say this, but you know, you don't hate to say it.

[01:59:04.390 --> 01:59:08.030]
Well, we need to get rid of him first. Okay. WQ. Why am hello?

[01:59:08.650 --> 01:59:12.030]
Hi, hello. Yes, sir. How you doing, man? Listen.

[01:59:12.950 --> 01:59:23.290]
I'm saying, but I got to tell you boy, these I figured I'm just a yellow guy. I figured I'd call in and try to say something instead of making a stupid sound.

[01:59:23.490 --> 01:59:32.050]
Yeah. Well, let's hear it. Well, listen, I wanted to tell you I really less not. I really felt like that girl that was crying at American Idol

[01:59:32.050 --> 01:59:39.190]
because I happened to be watching it. And it made me feel just like her in a sense that my God, I'm stuck in this country and in this city.

[01:59:39.190 --> 01:59:52.590]
You know, I'll listen in closing. WQ a M Hello. WQ a M Hello.

[01:59:53.350 --> 02:00:02.050]
Hi, I wasn't that good. Was it? No, not really very thick. Some of you got choked up in a middle of it.

[02:00:02.050 --> 02:00:07.110]
Hi, I'm Alex. You're going to do it. Learn how to do it right. Schmuck. WQ a M Hello.

[02:00:07.770 --> 02:00:12.370]
Hey, where are you? Jack's back when you go to woodbine. Yes, I would. I go ahead.

[02:00:12.610 --> 02:00:17.070]
I'm going to go ahead. Need all the support I get. Puse. Awesome.

[02:00:18.290 --> 02:00:25.570]
WQ a M Hello. Oh, Barack Obama. My home and native life.

[02:00:26.870 --> 02:00:32.790]
WQ a M Hello. I love to say this. George is good. WQ a M Hello.

[02:00:33.750 --> 02:00:37.070]
Yes, I got one for the bowl. Yes, Chuck Norris.

[02:00:39.110 --> 02:00:42.410]
And Chuck play the I saw you on the goes of Latina too.

[02:00:46.610 --> 02:00:47.690]
Sure, no problem.

[02:00:49.270 --> 02:00:54.550]
1771 votes on the poll. We got something leaked. We got a list. Whatever. Whatever we get we get.

[02:00:54.670 --> 02:00:58.330]
You know, and that's where I look at it. So don't sure what the courted Christopher is dead.

[02:00:58.450 --> 02:01:00.650]
You better, better we check your info there, Chris.

[02:01:03.830 --> 02:01:08.130]
And don't be sending all hookers by to try to, you know, mess up George's life, either while you're at it.

[02:01:08.450 --> 02:01:14.470]
Is that what you said before? No. You said send it right over. That's what I said. WQ a M Hello.

[02:01:15.050 --> 02:01:20.910]
Yeah, we want to thank Michael Jackson for finding that lost voice got forced. WQ a M Hello.

[02:01:21.930 --> 02:01:27.410]
Hi, I know for a Michael Jackson would have touched the even with his bad taste. He wouldn't have touched that kid. Q a M Hello.

[02:01:28.090 --> 02:01:37.810]
Hey, what's up, Uncle Neil? Yes, sir. I tell you, I've heard a lot of Neil Rogers shows, but today the back there is like through the roof, man. Yeah.

[02:01:39.210 --> 02:01:45.110]
Well, let me give you one for the poll and make a quick comment if I could go right ahead. I'll put Peter North for the poll.

[02:01:46.190 --> 02:01:56.730]
OK. And this thing that you did a poll about the morning show the other day. Remember about Kenny and whoever can you smoke in the morning show? Yeah.

[02:01:57.010 --> 02:02:02.890]
Yeah. You know, when Mo left, I thought about that. I said, do do do do do do. Yeah. You know what?

[02:02:02.890 --> 02:02:08.610]
As much as he's the fifth me off at times, I enjoy the show pretty much. You know, and and after that.

[02:02:09.850 --> 02:02:20.270]
It's like 10 to 2 and I'm gone. And I'm not anti sports. I like the mags all getting everything. But just, you know, the love best between him and Captain Curtis. That's borderline.

[02:02:20.810 --> 02:02:26.810]
Really? Oh, Captain. Oh, Captain. 28 year old. You know, I said, go to Captain.

[02:02:29.610 --> 02:02:37.630]
You know, back in four. It's borderline. Yeah. Well, thank God there's nothing. Yeah. I'm sure I'll tell you that. Well, you know what?

[02:02:37.710 --> 02:02:43.650]
And then and then to find out that he was a bush flicker. I know I shouldn't let politics, you know, I'm influenced and opinion like that.

[02:02:43.850 --> 02:02:49.550]
But I knew that comedy throughout like a few months ago. Well, did you see the president in the speech? She did a really good job. Yeah.

[02:02:50.930 --> 02:02:53.550]
So let me ask you this. How long you and Stugas been sleeping together?

[02:02:55.510 --> 02:03:05.410]
Stugas. WDQ way M. Hello. WDQ way M. Hello. Hey, Neil. This is the maintenance man from Westland Mall, J.C. Pan.

[02:03:08.350 --> 02:03:17.730]
WDQ way M. Hello. Sam Rosen. Got a nose hockey. Amen. Sam Rosen could be the obvious man in the history of mankind. He really could be a good

[02:03:18.110 --> 02:03:30.590]
man. And now he can actually say something that JD is out of there. Goodbye JD. Go away JD. How about those leaves, baby? Let's do some hockey talk. That'll whip these people up into a frenzy. That'll give us down to a nice point. 001 share.

[02:03:31.990 --> 02:03:44.490]
1775 votes. We got 1100. So what's not to like? I got my pants on. I got my shirt during this next break. I'm going to put on my shoes. I got the pantaloons and ready to get off the woodbind and plunge my guts. WDQ way M. Hello.

[02:03:45.110 --> 02:03:57.590]
Hey, Neil Rogers. Who's in Joe? How you doing, buddy? Okay, Joe. Hey, I got a joke for you. Well, we don't do jokes, Joe, especially with a bad New York accent. We don't do jokes, Joe. WDQ way M. Hello.

[02:03:58.010 --> 02:04:06.990]
You killed trying to do it with that dog. Who didn't you? Yes, I did. And I put his head in the box and sending it to your house. WQ a M. Hello.

[02:04:07.610 --> 02:04:20.250]
Do you like it? WQ a M. Hello. Neil before you go, can you just say freeze major Miami vice president? Can't do it. Can't do it, Sally. WQ a M. Hello.

[02:04:23.070 --> 02:04:31.890]
Q way M. Hello. You get a line. I get a phone. The old WQ a M. Hello. One for the poll. We're on regional side.

[02:04:34.330 --> 02:04:46.430]
Okay. It's your crowd, man. Yeah, yeah, blame me. Yeah, I do blame you. Thousand. What we got in 1063. Yeah, all of a sudden they like came to a halt there for an hour.

[02:04:46.430 --> 02:04:53.790]
What was that a technical thing was that we find out or what? He said we ran out of space. Oh, I see. I knew it wasn't just me.

[02:04:55.010 --> 02:05:05.730]
I wasn't just sitting here hyperventilating about nothing. We ran out of space. Well, what with all the zombies? I mean, he's going to be sending me another big bill in the mail for more space on there. Is that what it is?

[02:05:06.250 --> 02:05:28.390]
No, it's for more bandwidth. Like on my 31st anniversary, I opened up my my hot mail. What do I get or my whatever it was? My Yahoo. And here's a email from Eric not saying, hey, congratulations old man. Happy 31st anniversary. Here's a bill for February for the bandwidth for whatever this crap is. Yeah, you didn't say that.

[02:05:28.950 --> 02:05:33.210]
But that's okay. I'm respected for him because he's in Orlando. Yeah, he's got issues.

[02:05:35.790 --> 02:05:50.810]
1083 on a poll. We got 1100. In fact, we probably got to go on for 12, but I'm not going to do it too much pressure today. Don't forget NADDog coming up at 2. No ballgame today, but tomorrow 1250. Marlins at the Cardinals. And we got all this around golf stuff coming up this week. That should really put us over the time.

[02:05:50.810 --> 02:05:55.290]
This is on. This is not a tumor. It's the ones at 2 hour.

[02:05:57.330 --> 02:05:58.090]
Woohoo!

[02:05:59.690 --> 02:06:00.650]
Yep. Yep.

[02:06:01.310 --> 02:06:10.530]
Three gold at the time my brain is wet. I'm what they call the 29%.

[02:06:11.530 --> 02:06:15.010]
Now there's push and then a stranger knows what it was.

[02:06:15.190 --> 02:06:27.030]
There's police and everything I see about the news is I still I believe you know me when you silly.

[02:06:28.030 --> 02:06:32.010]
I know me the magnet on my ass.

[02:06:32.270 --> 02:06:42.590]
You think I support the truth better than let me that China yellow like that on my

[02:06:42.590 --> 02:07:12.370]
awat, pictures that get across midnight and you have to find me in the

[02:07:12.370 --> 02:07:12.570]
your

[02:07:12.570 --> 02:07:17.950]
Oh, To prove or treat or ship in That's alright by the-

[02:07:17.950 --> 02:07:21.230]
A lol, they can't come And if the red it goes

[02:07:21.230 --> 02:07:23.550]
Last hour horror, exactly.

[02:07:24.150 --> 02:07:27.990]
And a yellow magnetic And I'll mine his

[02:07:27.990 --> 02:07:30.610]
Mine is new reading

[02:07:31.270 --> 02:07:31.950]
Oh, nitrogen,

[02:07:32.370 --> 02:07:35.430]
My parents we only sold the sometime when their wound

[02:07:35.430 --> 02:07:36.210]
T Granny of evil

[02:07:36.210 --> 02:07:38.290]
So you just arranged me for his chickens

[02:07:38.290 --> 02:07:40.630]
And, Dim, all mine was然後 placed on the woodenлич regular

[02:07:43.570 --> 02:07:43.970]
5-6-7-0-5-60.

[02:07:43.970 --> 02:07:44.910]
We got one in 5-6.

[02:07:45.010 --> 02:07:46.050]
We got two in the other.

[02:07:46.110 --> 02:07:46.870]
I'm ready like that.

[02:07:46.990 --> 02:07:48.930]
I just went of our technical to people who are here.

[02:07:49.170 --> 02:07:52.890]
And despite the fact we ran out of space or whatever the story is, he's peddling now.

[02:07:54.950 --> 02:07:55.930]
Does nobody's peddling?

[02:07:56.330 --> 02:07:56.530]
Space.

[02:07:57.350 --> 02:07:58.950]
5-6-7-0-5-60.

[02:07:59.150 --> 02:07:59.850]
We got an hour to kill.

[02:08:00.010 --> 02:08:01.850]
See, I think that we ought to have the ball games every day.

[02:08:02.110 --> 02:08:03.190]
These people talking about tapes.

[02:08:03.530 --> 02:08:05.410]
Let's play tapes of yesterday's ball game.

[02:08:06.190 --> 02:08:08.170]
We kind of had the pregame show staring 11 minutes ago.

[02:08:08.170 --> 02:08:11.050]
I could be already a third of the way to Woodbine for Christ's sakes.

[02:08:11.570 --> 02:08:12.930]
I could be on the way to lose my ass today.

[02:08:13.970 --> 02:08:15.730]
5-6-7-0-5-60.

[02:08:16.530 --> 02:08:19.750]
See, that was a great format we had Monday for however long we were on.

[02:08:19.830 --> 02:08:20.710]
A couple of hours in it yesterday.

[02:08:20.710 --> 02:08:21.770]
We managed to squeeze.

[02:08:22.210 --> 02:08:25.630]
It took a little bit of an incredible amount of kick into the pantaloonies and stuff like that.

[02:08:26.050 --> 02:08:28.110]
And then today it's like, oh geez, we can't do this.

[02:08:29.210 --> 02:08:30.250]
They don't look.

[02:08:30.470 --> 02:08:31.430]
They ain't got it, okay?

[02:08:32.050 --> 02:08:37.550]
You cannot take 400 pounds of chicken droppings and turn it into a freaking sauce-verage steak.

[02:08:39.010 --> 02:08:39.970]
You can't do it.

[02:08:40.730 --> 02:08:41.970]
And that's south Florida, man.

[02:08:42.250 --> 02:08:44.770]
I'm ready to take the whole phone like I did on a Toyota in Monday.

[02:08:44.930 --> 02:08:48.250]
Take the whole Aspirators and take it on the balcony as long as I don't hurt anybody.

[02:08:48.590 --> 02:08:49.690]
And just drop it over the edge.

[02:08:50.170 --> 02:08:51.530]
I have some guy downstairs like the cons.

[02:08:51.710 --> 02:08:52.330]
He airs for something.

[02:08:52.810 --> 02:08:52.970]
Yeah.

[02:08:53.150 --> 02:08:53.890]
Keep the street clear.

[02:08:54.010 --> 02:08:54.990]
Maybe put some cones up.

[02:08:56.650 --> 02:08:57.450]
That's a good idea.

[02:08:58.010 --> 02:09:00.930]
Just take all anything he has to do with his phone and just dump it over the edge.

[02:09:01.090 --> 02:09:03.610]
And have him hold the microphone down there too so we can hear the crash.

[02:09:05.830 --> 02:09:06.150]
WQAM.

[02:09:06.150 --> 02:09:06.430]
Hello.

[02:09:07.470 --> 02:09:07.870]
Bill.

[02:09:08.170 --> 02:09:08.810]
Yes, sir.

[02:09:09.110 --> 02:09:09.890]
Hey, how you doing, buddy?

[02:09:10.290 --> 02:09:10.570]
Okay.

[02:09:11.210 --> 02:09:12.630]
Hey, I want to ask you something.

[02:09:12.850 --> 02:09:15.310]
What do my calls, it says you would boss Vegas yesterday?

[02:09:16.270 --> 02:09:16.910]
You said what?

[02:09:17.510 --> 02:09:18.190]
I said what?

[02:09:18.430 --> 02:09:19.450]
I said you would boss Vegas.

[02:09:19.670 --> 02:09:20.030]
You call yesterday?

[02:09:20.730 --> 02:09:20.950]
Yeah.

[02:09:21.390 --> 02:09:22.210]
And you call them if you're here.

[02:09:22.270 --> 02:09:23.150]
It doesn't get along with you guys.

[02:09:24.370 --> 02:09:24.770]
Rikies?

[02:09:25.310 --> 02:09:27.930]
No, that's one that brings you guys to your guys' breakfast.

[02:09:28.090 --> 02:09:28.510]
Char-hut.

[02:09:29.110 --> 02:09:29.830]
Char-hut.

[02:09:30.270 --> 02:09:33.050]
The reason why they're not going to be speaking to you people anymore.

[02:09:33.050 --> 02:09:35.950]
You got poorly in the back and they fear poorly.

[02:09:36.050 --> 02:09:38.810]
They fear what it's going to do to their bottom line.

[02:09:39.110 --> 02:09:39.450]
Portally?

[02:09:39.530 --> 02:09:40.070]
That's the truth.

[02:09:40.290 --> 02:09:41.670]
Yeah, that's the big point.

[02:09:42.350 --> 02:09:43.210]
Rotundo in the back.

[02:09:43.430 --> 02:09:43.970]
That's the guy.

[02:09:44.290 --> 02:09:44.930]
Oh, is that it?

[02:09:44.930 --> 02:09:45.590]
He's not in the back.

[02:09:46.350 --> 02:09:47.090]
He's in the front.

[02:09:47.410 --> 02:09:47.550]
Right.

[02:09:48.130 --> 02:09:48.850]
He's in the front.

[02:09:48.910 --> 02:09:49.450]
You like it like that?

[02:09:51.150 --> 02:09:51.770]
WQAM, how?

[02:09:51.910 --> 02:09:52.590]
It makes it easier to maneuver.

[02:09:54.030 --> 02:09:54.430]
QAM.

[02:09:56.050 --> 02:09:57.470]
I have a question for George.

[02:09:57.990 --> 02:09:58.390]
Yes.

[02:10:01.010 --> 02:10:01.410]
George.

[02:10:01.730 --> 02:10:02.210]
Right here, man.

[02:10:03.530 --> 02:10:03.850]
Who?

[02:10:03.850 --> 02:10:04.890]
Lily Allen, I am your wine her.

[02:10:05.390 --> 02:10:05.550]
Who?

[02:10:06.230 --> 02:10:07.630]
Lily Allen, I am your wine her.

[02:10:07.770 --> 02:10:08.050]
It's the same.

[02:10:08.170 --> 02:10:08.610]
It's from London.

[02:10:09.310 --> 02:10:10.170]
I don't know who they are.

[02:10:10.310 --> 02:10:11.270]
Lily Allen, how's that?

[02:10:11.410 --> 02:10:12.270]
Because that's one I've heard of.

[02:10:12.790 --> 02:10:13.530]
That's the one you heard of?

[02:10:14.250 --> 02:10:15.370]
You haven't heard of Amy Wine her?

[02:10:15.630 --> 02:10:15.770]
No.

[02:10:16.470 --> 02:10:17.130]
She's good, Jeff.

[02:10:17.290 --> 02:10:18.250]
She sounds like Erica Biden.

[02:10:18.470 --> 02:10:19.030]
Okay, boring.

[02:10:19.910 --> 02:10:19.990]
Boring, boring.

[02:10:20.610 --> 02:10:21.210]
WQAM, hello.

[02:10:21.890 --> 02:10:23.050]
No, don't listen to other people.

[02:10:23.190 --> 02:10:23.590]
You're awesome.

[02:10:23.850 --> 02:10:24.870]
However, Canada sucks.

[02:10:25.550 --> 02:10:26.170]
Okay, thank you.

[02:10:27.330 --> 02:10:27.910]
WQAM, hello.

[02:10:30.390 --> 02:10:30.910]
Yes, sir.

[02:10:31.910 --> 02:10:32.310]
Hi.

[02:10:33.290 --> 02:10:34.790]
Why don't you let you guys know?

[02:10:34.950 --> 02:10:40.470]
I'm not going to be because of this wireless car that you have on the end for your laptop.

[02:10:41.130 --> 02:10:41.930]
I'm able to listen to you.

[02:10:42.050 --> 02:10:42.930]
You have to be in a random way, sir.

[02:10:43.250 --> 02:10:43.950]
Keep up the good work.

[02:10:44.330 --> 02:10:44.330]

[02:10:46.990 --> 02:10:48.370]
Keep up the good work.

[02:10:49.170 --> 02:10:50.150]
Oh my god.

[02:10:50.270 --> 02:10:51.370]
This is really something.

[02:10:51.530 --> 02:10:52.730]
It's a fly opener if it's anything.

[02:10:53.050 --> 02:10:53.230]
Love it.

[02:10:53.270 --> 02:10:54.370]
105 votes on the pool.

[02:10:56.010 --> 02:11:00.090]
If I could be somebody else for one day, I would be Hugh Hefner, 301.

[02:11:01.430 --> 02:11:03.990]
All they know, Hugh Hefner, Hugh Hefner, Hugh Hefner.

[02:11:04.230 --> 02:11:05.250]
Look at all the broads he did.

[02:11:05.470 --> 02:11:07.610]
Yeah, again, he's 145 years old, okay?

[02:11:07.830 --> 02:11:08.790]
He's probably got a bag.

[02:11:09.010 --> 02:11:11.690]
They probably got, you know, keeping him alive with tubes in his nose.

[02:11:13.690 --> 02:11:14.090]
301.

[02:11:15.050 --> 02:11:16.550]
I got to be me, 256.

[02:11:16.830 --> 02:11:19.330]
And of course, listening to these people on the phone, it's obvious why.

[02:11:20.770 --> 02:11:21.730]
Tiger Woods 125.

[02:11:22.330 --> 02:11:23.730]
Because he's got that hot blind wife.

[02:11:24.550 --> 02:11:25.490]
I hate this pool.

[02:11:25.670 --> 02:11:25.930]
88.

[02:11:26.110 --> 02:11:27.090]
It keeps going up 7.9%.

[02:11:27.690 --> 02:11:28.370]
I don't blame you.

[02:11:29.250 --> 02:11:31.490]
Howard Stern 40, 70, or just 46.

[02:11:31.490 --> 02:11:32.650]
I'm writing how he's asked.

[02:11:33.710 --> 02:11:34.630]
Bill Clinton 46.

[02:11:34.950 --> 02:11:36.070]
George W. 45.

[02:11:37.350 --> 02:11:38.290]
Tom Brady 39.

[02:11:38.470 --> 02:11:40.030]
Tommy's climbing the ladder fast.

[02:11:40.730 --> 02:11:42.170]
Anybody but who I am 33.

[02:11:42.770 --> 02:11:43.490]
Bill Gates 19.

[02:11:44.190 --> 02:11:45.230]
Wayne Heisinga 18.

[02:11:45.650 --> 02:11:46.650]
Hillary Clinton at 9.

[02:11:46.830 --> 02:11:47.850]
Nine guys want to be Hillary.

[02:11:48.410 --> 02:11:49.990]
They want to be that macho, that butcher.

[02:11:51.710 --> 02:11:52.830]
George Rodriguez, look at that.

[02:11:52.830 --> 02:11:53.550]
You're all way up to 8.

[02:11:53.630 --> 02:11:54.470]
You're writing a Hillary's house.

[02:11:55.190 --> 02:11:55.190]

[02:11:55.190 --> 02:11:56.330]
Maybe they want to work with you.

[02:11:56.330 --> 02:11:59.970]
You pass Paul Allen like he was sitting out in a prone position, 7 for Paul Allen.

[02:12:00.510 --> 02:12:02.070]
Shaquille O'Neill, Shaq's got 6.

[02:12:03.410 --> 02:12:10.250]
Brady Quinn 5, Ron Jeremy 4, Vanessa Perredease 4, and Peter North, the old straight shooter 3.

[02:12:10.650 --> 02:12:12.750]
Or a problem with that is Peter District 145.

[02:12:13.650 --> 02:12:14.610]
He can still bring it though.

[02:12:14.690 --> 02:12:16.230]
He can still bring it if he catch my drift.

[02:12:16.550 --> 02:12:17.510]
Love 115 votes.

[02:12:18.470 --> 02:12:20.230]
He can still bring it and he can still send it.

[02:12:20.950 --> 02:12:21.650]
WQAM, hello.

[02:12:23.310 --> 02:12:26.850]
Neil, I would really love to see the one I ever do to you guys.

[02:12:27.450 --> 02:12:27.630]
Yeah.

[02:12:28.210 --> 02:12:29.130]
Put that on your list.

[02:12:29.650 --> 02:12:31.030]
Because what did I ever do to you?

[02:12:31.810 --> 02:12:32.530]
WQAM, hello.

[02:12:33.670 --> 02:12:34.830]
Oh, yes.

[02:12:35.470 --> 02:12:35.650]
Neil.

[02:12:36.210 --> 02:12:36.290]
Yeah.

[02:12:38.850 --> 02:12:41.070]
Do you have a list of WSDR?

[02:12:42.110 --> 02:12:42.730]
Or what?

[02:12:43.350 --> 02:12:43.790]
NPR?

[02:12:44.550 --> 02:12:44.990]
No.

[02:12:45.750 --> 02:12:49.650]
Because they have an interview with the lay on yesterday that would make your choice.

[02:12:49.650 --> 02:12:49.810]
Sure.

[02:12:49.810 --> 02:12:51.290]
I don't want to hear about Tom Delay.

[02:12:51.350 --> 02:12:53.590]
I don't want to hear that he was on yesterday morning on the day of the show.

[02:12:53.730 --> 02:12:57.870]
I don't want to hear that he was on the meet the press with Tim Russell.

[02:12:58.270 --> 02:12:59.570]
I don't care about Tom Delay.

[02:12:59.870 --> 02:13:01.470]
Get it through your brain, OK?

[02:13:02.350 --> 02:13:03.710]
I don't freaking care.

[02:13:03.830 --> 02:13:07.190]
The fact that they keep bringing this criminal and sticking on the air all over the place.

[02:13:07.510 --> 02:13:08.350]
And you people keep the law.

[02:13:08.350 --> 02:13:09.110]
Listen to it.

[02:13:09.890 --> 02:13:11.070]
What is wrong with you?

[02:13:12.670 --> 02:13:15.130]
I don't think we're ever going to discuss politics on the show again.

[02:13:15.230 --> 02:13:19.010]
I think since we're making up all these new rules this week for everything, for every part of my life,

[02:13:19.010 --> 02:13:20.310]
let's make up that one too.

[02:13:20.570 --> 02:13:20.970]
No more.

[02:13:21.890 --> 02:13:23.370]
Until at least the turn of the year.

[02:13:23.510 --> 02:13:24.970]
Until we have an election coming.

[02:13:25.190 --> 02:13:26.350]
Till there's something we're talking about.

[02:13:28.030 --> 02:13:31.670]
All these great political experts out there, they had Tom Delay on NPR.

[02:13:31.970 --> 02:13:33.730]
And this one really ripped him an ass about you.

[02:13:33.970 --> 02:13:35.070]
And who cares?

[02:13:36.250 --> 02:13:38.890]
That's like saying that they brought 400 pounds of elephant crap on it.

[02:13:38.970 --> 02:13:39.630]
And put it on the table.

[02:13:39.630 --> 02:13:40.590]
I said it smelled bad.

[02:13:40.890 --> 02:13:41.150]
Wow.

[02:13:42.170 --> 02:13:44.730]
Even in the Bible they never had revelations like that, baby.

[02:13:45.470 --> 02:13:45.870]
Man.

[02:13:46.310 --> 02:13:47.590]
Is that heavy duty or what?

[02:13:48.230 --> 02:13:48.890]
That's duty.

[02:13:49.650 --> 02:13:50.470]
WDQA and Hello.

[02:13:50.690 --> 02:13:51.890]
God these colors suck.

[02:13:52.490 --> 02:13:53.290]
WDQA and Hello.

[02:13:55.950 --> 02:13:56.750]
WDQA and Hola.

[02:13:57.330 --> 02:13:58.710]
Check yourself out.

[02:13:58.710 --> 02:13:58.710]

[02:14:00.370 --> 02:14:01.190]
WDQA and Hello.

[02:14:01.690 --> 02:14:02.430]
How's it going, Del?

[02:14:02.810 --> 02:14:03.090]
Great.

[02:14:03.870 --> 02:14:06.450]
First and world over here painting in Fort Lauderdale.

[02:14:06.750 --> 02:14:09.930]
On the end of the course, the next door, it's Al Goldstein's All-Powse.

[02:14:10.330 --> 02:14:12.270]
How does it remove the middle finger?

[02:14:12.970 --> 02:14:13.110]
Yeah.

[02:14:13.210 --> 02:14:14.510]
And I don't know what happened to Al.

[02:14:15.070 --> 02:14:15.870]
He's not here.

[02:14:16.430 --> 02:14:16.630]
Yeah.

[02:14:16.630 --> 02:14:19.930]
He lost everything, man.

[02:14:20.310 --> 02:14:21.430]
Oh, that's too bad.

[02:14:21.970 --> 02:14:22.570]
All right.

[02:14:22.890 --> 02:14:23.670]
Good show, Neil.

[02:14:23.810 --> 02:14:24.090]
Thank you.

[02:14:24.130 --> 02:14:24.550]
Okay, sir.

[02:14:24.730 --> 02:14:25.290]
Okay, good luck.

[02:14:26.070 --> 02:14:27.170]
Bad call, good show.

[02:14:28.370 --> 02:14:29.150]
Poor Al, man.

[02:14:29.290 --> 02:14:32.250]
That's what we, let's get Al on here and see if he can like, go to a slander of few people.

[02:14:32.430 --> 02:14:33.150]
I hate the irony.

[02:14:33.310 --> 02:14:34.390]
There you go.

[02:14:34.750 --> 02:14:35.110]
New.

[02:14:36.350 --> 02:14:36.610]
Yeah.

[02:14:37.490 --> 02:14:40.970]
This is your all-powerful and friendly vice president.

[02:14:41.930 --> 02:14:43.850]
See, he, one ton of most good thing.

[02:14:43.850 --> 02:14:47.650]
I'm too, give you a better understanding here.

[02:14:48.870 --> 02:14:51.190]
I have to lead people, haven't I?

[02:14:51.430 --> 02:14:53.610]
I have a, I give a spongebob for 9-11.

[02:14:53.970 --> 02:14:56.450]
There's only something you do with the door, as always.

[02:14:56.990 --> 02:14:58.930]
You were not lying into a water.

[02:14:59.230 --> 02:15:00.830]
He was the detigling is all along.

[02:15:01.810 --> 02:15:04.850]
I was a close relative to Zatamu, chained in the inshundra.

[02:15:06.170 --> 02:15:07.370]
Oh, fair, boop, fair.

[02:15:07.990 --> 02:15:09.930]
They called me uncle, okay.

[02:15:10.790 --> 02:15:14.350]
I know, a motor responsible for the twin tower bombing in 93.

[02:15:15.190 --> 02:15:16.310]
Yes, mommy.

[02:15:16.610 --> 02:15:17.390]
It was I.

[02:15:17.770 --> 02:15:18.650]
It was I.

[02:15:19.470 --> 02:15:21.930]
It was also I who sent the ant's rats.

[02:15:22.530 --> 02:15:24.670]
It was I who sunk the beach mark.

[02:15:25.570 --> 02:15:27.710]
It was I who outed battery play.

[02:15:28.230 --> 02:15:29.790]
Not Bob, no back-o-car road.

[02:15:30.550 --> 02:15:32.450]
Yeah, nothing to do with it whatsoever.

[02:15:33.010 --> 02:15:33.750]
It was all me.

[02:15:34.170 --> 02:15:37.890]
It was also I who killed Shundra Levy in the blonde in a hoop.

[02:15:38.470 --> 02:15:41.710]
It was I who was the mastermind behind the mannequin idol.

[02:15:42.290 --> 02:15:47.250]
It was I who hired me to cross me to read the headlines despite every time I speak in bed of it.

[02:15:47.370 --> 02:15:47.730]
Oh!

[02:15:49.210 --> 02:15:52.770]
It was I who played saturated fads and shiko sticks.

[02:15:53.030 --> 02:15:54.690]
What else can I tell you?

[02:15:55.850 --> 02:15:57.570]
Okay, okay.

[02:15:58.110 --> 02:16:00.490]
It was I who invented skinny jeans.

[02:16:00.910 --> 02:16:03.090]
Of which no one of questionable girls can wear.

[02:16:03.750 --> 02:16:06.150]
Is it my phone time of my jungle lotion?

[02:16:06.150 --> 02:16:08.370]
Oh, boy, that's your torture to me.

[02:16:08.550 --> 02:16:10.050]
I have been dead for three years.

[02:16:10.550 --> 02:16:11.350]
I don't sure when.

[02:16:11.530 --> 02:16:13.730]
And so, one sixteen and five sixty-watt QAM.

[02:16:13.810 --> 02:16:20.130]
So anyhow, I ever whether you saw this, whether you have the copy that I get with the disc every week from chicken neck.

[02:16:20.870 --> 02:16:22.470]
I get a copy of the disc.

[02:16:22.670 --> 02:16:23.730]
I don't think you've deleted the phone.

[02:16:23.930 --> 02:16:24.590]
This I got on here.

[02:16:26.130 --> 02:16:26.510]
Wow.

[02:16:27.050 --> 02:16:29.850]
When does the star spin?

[02:16:30.790 --> 02:16:31.690]
Crime sheeners, man.

[02:16:32.690 --> 02:16:33.450]
No, don't think I got that.

[02:16:34.450 --> 02:16:35.070]
Oh!

[02:16:38.150 --> 02:16:38.850]
Oh, right!

[02:16:39.310 --> 02:16:40.730]
Wow, that's rich and cool.

[02:16:42.850 --> 02:16:43.470]
Oh!

[02:16:43.870 --> 02:16:44.670]
I might wet myself.

[02:16:45.590 --> 02:16:46.730]
Crime sheeners, man.

[02:16:47.910 --> 02:16:48.930]
Oh, yeah, here it comes.

[02:16:54.790 --> 02:16:55.410]
Huh?

[02:16:55.950 --> 02:16:59.130]
Oh, boy, that's peaceful.

[02:16:59.870 --> 02:17:01.590]
I can't wait.

[02:17:02.950 --> 02:17:03.430]
Oh, boy.

[02:17:04.430 --> 02:17:10.390]
And never would we look at one another.

[02:17:19.430 --> 02:17:22.590]
I thought you were a child.

[02:17:23.090 --> 02:17:33.410]
I thought you were a child.

[02:17:33.410 --> 02:17:36.310]
You were a child.

[02:17:36.310 --> 02:17:38.270]
I thought you were a child.

[02:17:38.410 --> 02:17:43.610]
And all the bad things I've done in history.

[02:17:47.750 --> 02:17:53.830]
All the wrongs may only be where I know.

[02:17:55.770 --> 02:18:03.730]
Where you've got time to wish to make it all.

[02:18:05.490 --> 02:18:07.410]
Let's go.

[02:18:23.830 --> 02:18:24.530]
Oh!

[02:18:31.490 --> 02:18:39.370]
This is the first time I've ever shown you.

[02:18:41.830 --> 02:18:49.550]
And darling, you've been sharing all this with me.

[02:18:52.550 --> 02:18:58.910]
Let me tell you now.

[02:19:01.550 --> 02:19:08.050]
When I was a child, I thought I'd wait.

[02:19:13.210 --> 02:19:18.050]
And I was a child.

[02:19:37.170 --> 02:19:37.930]
And I was a child.

[02:19:46.750 --> 02:19:47.090]
Oh!

[02:19:47.290 --> 02:19:48.650]
Like a religious experience.

[02:19:48.890 --> 02:19:49.210]
Great.

[02:19:49.750 --> 02:19:50.770]
When that incredible, I like it.

[02:19:50.910 --> 02:19:54.170]
It had kind of a cow-soul's flavor to it, which I like.

[02:19:55.290 --> 02:19:56.170]
The cow-piles?

[02:19:56.430 --> 02:19:56.570]
Yeah.

[02:19:57.910 --> 02:19:58.370]
You know, no.

[02:19:58.370 --> 02:19:59.050]
Crime sheeners.

[02:19:59.130 --> 02:20:00.070]
It really is a crime sheeners.

[02:20:00.270 --> 02:20:02.150]
She had two big hits up on her roof and it could be where I love.

[02:20:02.230 --> 02:20:04.290]
Which if he has the other one, it could be where I love.

[02:20:04.370 --> 02:20:06.770]
I may just have an accident on the floor right in the room.

[02:20:06.770 --> 02:20:06.930]
Oh, yeah.

[02:20:06.990 --> 02:20:07.650]
In the studio, huh?

[02:20:07.910 --> 02:20:08.630]
We'll find it for you.

[02:20:09.050 --> 02:20:09.370]
Wow.

[02:20:09.710 --> 02:20:12.970]
When that piece of something would happen, you'll revelation me before they stick my fat old ass in the ground.

[02:20:14.270 --> 02:20:15.350]
113 downloads on the pool.

[02:20:15.530 --> 02:20:17.750]
We would have had a shot at 1200 if we would have pushed it today.

[02:20:19.250 --> 02:20:20.490]
I'm just one of those guys now.

[02:20:20.510 --> 02:20:24.710]
I'm just kind of like looking outside, thinking about going to the patio, putting one leg over the edge.

[02:20:24.910 --> 02:20:25.190]
Oh!

[02:20:25.570 --> 02:20:26.110]
Cut the crap.

[02:20:26.550 --> 02:20:27.650]
You got money to lose today.

[02:20:27.770 --> 02:20:28.370]
You can't do that.

[02:20:28.790 --> 02:20:29.470]
Yeah, like I said.

[02:20:31.830 --> 02:20:32.450]
WNQAM, hello.

[02:20:32.870 --> 02:20:34.150]
George Bush is hit, Laura.

[02:20:35.470 --> 02:20:36.130]
WNQAM, hello.

[02:20:37.290 --> 02:20:38.170]
Hey, Neil.

[02:20:38.670 --> 02:20:38.850]
Yeah.

[02:20:39.450 --> 02:20:39.990]
How's it going?

[02:20:40.470 --> 02:20:40.730]
Great.

[02:20:41.310 --> 02:20:43.970]
I can tell you why I will be George Bush.

[02:20:44.990 --> 02:20:47.230]
So they could put honey and bird seeds in my wrap.

[02:20:48.850 --> 02:20:52.390]
5670560, pound 560 on the Verizon Singular wireless line.

[02:20:52.490 --> 02:20:54.170]
It seems to me I could be wrong, but I love you guys.

[02:20:54.170 --> 02:20:55.250]
We've had a real obsession with that.

[02:20:55.250 --> 02:20:55.930]
Let them ask.

[02:20:56.110 --> 02:20:56.510]
You know what I'm saying?

[02:20:56.510 --> 02:20:57.010]
Let them ask.

[02:20:57.010 --> 02:20:57.810]
That's all you know from it.

[02:20:57.810 --> 02:20:58.490]
Let them ask.

[02:20:58.710 --> 02:20:59.430]
Let them session.

[02:20:59.670 --> 02:21:00.550]
Get over it, okay?

[02:21:01.970 --> 02:21:04.090]
Come off with something a little bit new and more original.

[02:21:04.210 --> 02:21:07.790]
Instead of using my old tried and true material from 100 to last 100 years.

[02:21:07.830 --> 02:21:08.650]
Let them help.

[02:21:08.950 --> 02:21:09.850]
It damn, they're killing them.

[02:21:09.930 --> 02:21:10.290]
That's right.

[02:21:10.970 --> 02:21:12.150]
It's Lewis Knowsworth's hat.

[02:21:13.010 --> 02:21:13.410]
Let them.

[02:21:15.190 --> 02:21:15.910]
WNQAM, hello.

[02:21:16.510 --> 02:21:16.770]
Neil.

[02:21:17.290 --> 02:21:17.630]
Yes, sir.

[02:21:18.050 --> 02:21:21.150]
Did you know that the drummer for the crying chains had a hook?

[02:21:22.550 --> 02:21:22.970]
You had a what?

[02:21:23.510 --> 02:21:24.410]
He had a hook for an arm.

[02:21:24.910 --> 02:21:25.390]
He had a hook?

[02:21:25.830 --> 02:21:26.070]
Yeah.

[02:21:26.670 --> 02:21:27.370]
The drummer.

[02:21:27.710 --> 02:21:28.270]
The drummer.

[02:21:28.270 --> 02:21:29.870]
I've got to play drums with a hook.

[02:21:30.710 --> 02:21:31.370]
Very well.

[02:21:32.010 --> 02:21:33.350]
Yeah, it sounded pretty good to me.

[02:21:33.510 --> 02:21:34.390]
He's got a very prominent there.

[02:21:34.610 --> 02:21:35.830]
Okay, well, good old Captain Hook.

[02:21:36.250 --> 02:21:36.870]
Sit out in there.

[02:21:36.930 --> 02:21:38.230]
There's a little crying chain in Stryvia.

[02:21:39.350 --> 02:21:41.230]
Now we're making some real progress, baby.

[02:21:41.410 --> 02:21:43.130]
Now we're really kicking ass ancient style.

[02:21:44.450 --> 02:21:47.050]
The drummer for the crying chains had a hook.

[02:21:50.370 --> 02:21:51.050]
WQAM, hello.

[02:21:51.970 --> 02:21:53.270]
Neil, are you still thinking of Carl?

[02:21:53.930 --> 02:21:54.330]
Yeah.

[02:21:54.630 --> 02:21:55.010]
You got one?

[02:21:56.090 --> 02:21:56.330]
Yes.

[02:21:56.790 --> 02:21:57.070]
Okay.

[02:21:57.070 --> 02:21:58.410]
Just checking.

[02:21:58.670 --> 02:21:59.490]
WNQAM, hello.

[02:22:00.010 --> 02:22:02.450]
And you know, what's your take on that whole time delay thing?

[02:22:04.130 --> 02:22:04.690]
Yeah.

[02:22:05.330 --> 02:22:05.730]
Back to him.

[02:22:05.750 --> 02:22:06.270]
That's my take.

[02:22:07.110 --> 02:22:07.930]
WNQAM, hello.

[02:22:08.530 --> 02:22:09.770]
I catch myself.

[02:22:11.050 --> 02:22:11.970]
WNQAM, hello.

[02:22:13.190 --> 02:22:14.650]
Taste like a nickel to me.

[02:22:15.610 --> 02:22:16.490]
WNQAM, hello.

[02:22:17.110 --> 02:22:19.330]
I woke up with cancer this morning.

[02:22:20.270 --> 02:22:22.730]
WNQAM, that's definitely your buddy, your boyfriend.

[02:22:23.190 --> 02:22:24.770]
Doing David Cassidy stuff.

[02:22:24.910 --> 02:22:25.490]
QAM, hello.

[02:22:26.050 --> 02:22:27.050]
Hey, I want to the bar.

[02:22:27.050 --> 02:22:27.050]

[02:22:27.050 --> 02:22:27.050]

[02:22:27.050 --> 02:22:27.150]
Wow.

[02:22:27.510 --> 02:22:27.950]
Yes, sir.

[02:22:29.250 --> 02:22:29.970]
Sidney Crosby.

[02:22:32.110 --> 02:22:32.930]
He's ugly, man.

[02:22:33.630 --> 02:22:34.050]
You okay?

[02:22:34.290 --> 02:22:35.030]
What a hockey player.

[02:22:35.490 --> 02:22:35.950]
Yeah, okay.

[02:22:36.830 --> 02:22:38.150]
Sidney Crosby, put him on there.

[02:22:38.230 --> 02:22:39.230]
Okay, Sidney Crosby.

[02:22:39.230 --> 02:22:39.410]
Sidney Crosby.

[02:22:39.410 --> 02:22:39.410]

[02:22:39.410 --> 02:22:40.790]
What's the big red hockey player this guy?

[02:22:41.190 --> 02:22:42.810]
Oh, I'm sure he's got millions of dollars.

[02:22:43.190 --> 02:22:44.590]
And he's getting whatever the hell he wants, you know?

[02:22:45.270 --> 02:22:48.050]
When you're a big job like that, no matter how grotesque your schnauzes

[02:22:48.050 --> 02:22:50.750]
is, what you look like, he's getting all he can handle, baby.

[02:22:50.990 --> 02:22:52.010]
Make no mistake about that.

[02:22:52.490 --> 02:22:53.950]
He shoots, he scores, you know what I'm saying?

[02:22:53.950 --> 02:22:54.930]
It's my drift.

[02:22:55.650 --> 02:22:56.850]
1143 votes on the pole.

[02:22:59.590 --> 02:23:01.390]
The end of the thing we got that Marlon again tomorrow.

[02:23:01.570 --> 02:23:02.830]
Well, I'm going to need to be brief tomorrow.

[02:23:02.950 --> 02:23:06.150]
I'm going to have to try to put the pieces of my brains back together again.

[02:23:07.810 --> 02:23:08.470]
WNQAM, hello.

[02:23:09.110 --> 02:23:09.750]
Where's Pete?

[02:23:09.890 --> 02:23:11.370]
He's from Pepper Pine, center.

[02:23:12.230 --> 02:23:12.930]
WNQAM, hello.

[02:23:14.570 --> 02:23:15.530]
Hi, Neil.

[02:23:16.010 --> 02:23:16.430]
Yes, sir.

[02:23:17.470 --> 02:23:18.450]
Cut a call for Neil.

[02:23:19.370 --> 02:23:20.170]
Let me say it again.

[02:23:20.450 --> 02:23:21.390]
This is Neil, sir.

[02:23:22.130 --> 02:23:22.990]
That's fine, Neil.

[02:23:23.130 --> 02:23:23.470]
That was quick.

[02:23:23.470 --> 02:23:24.230]
What's the question?

[02:23:24.430 --> 02:23:28.010]
Why don't you keep pushing the button on that rectum bit that he pushes?

[02:23:28.250 --> 02:23:29.090]
He's getting kind of trite.

[02:23:29.370 --> 02:23:30.030]
That he pushes?

[02:23:30.670 --> 02:23:32.850]
Yeah, obviously when he says rectum.

[02:23:33.110 --> 02:23:33.950]
Well, who's he?

[02:23:34.170 --> 02:23:35.030]
Wait a minute, who's he?

[02:23:35.470 --> 02:23:37.730]
Your colleague, yes, he is in the Miami end.

[02:23:38.150 --> 02:23:39.210]
He's not pushing any button.

[02:23:39.270 --> 02:23:40.050]
I'm doing it right here.

[02:23:42.410 --> 02:23:44.090]
He don't push any buttons, okay?

[02:23:44.330 --> 02:23:46.970]
He's putting the button on your dumb call.

[02:23:48.610 --> 02:23:49.530]
Why does he keep pushing the button?

[02:23:49.670 --> 02:23:50.710]
He's blaming you for that.

[02:23:51.670 --> 02:23:53.330]
It's getting kind of stale as what he says.

[02:23:53.470 --> 02:23:56.370]
Well, maybe if you do a little cleansing, you might help.

[02:23:56.670 --> 02:23:57.530]
I've got a bidet.

[02:23:58.130 --> 02:23:58.970]
Yeah, there you go.

[02:24:00.690 --> 02:24:02.330]
Little body wars couldn't hurt.

[02:24:03.930 --> 02:24:04.910]
There are two QAAM, hello.

[02:24:05.430 --> 02:24:07.350]
Yeah, two thumbs up for that saw, Neil.

[02:24:08.050 --> 02:24:08.870]
When you like that?

[02:24:09.390 --> 02:24:09.790]
Excellent.

[02:24:09.790 --> 02:24:10.650]
There you go, excellent.

[02:24:10.790 --> 02:24:11.610]
This guy actually liked.

[02:24:12.390 --> 02:24:14.770]
Usually when I play music, which I try to avoid, like to play,

[02:24:14.910 --> 02:24:17.790]
and I wasn't doing it to kill time, it's just that he put it on the visc.

[02:24:18.490 --> 02:24:22.250]
And I was just so overwhelmed by the fact he put it on there.

[02:24:23.930 --> 02:24:27.590]
Overwhelmed, emotional, like almost in tears, almost.

[02:24:28.950 --> 02:24:29.870]
Do you think it's that good?

[02:24:30.790 --> 02:24:31.350]
I liked it.

[02:24:31.490 --> 02:24:32.010]
I liked it a lot.

[02:24:32.630 --> 02:24:34.950]
Well, thank God I've never heard it since maybe then.

[02:24:35.850 --> 02:24:37.010]
Since you were up on the roof.

[02:24:37.390 --> 02:24:37.490]
Right.

[02:24:38.410 --> 02:24:39.150]
WQA, hello.

[02:24:40.550 --> 02:24:41.470]
Yeah, I knew it.

[02:24:41.650 --> 02:24:42.790]
Since the roofer is around the roof.

[02:24:42.870 --> 02:24:43.210]
Yes, sir.

[02:24:43.710 --> 02:24:44.250]
Well, I'm sorry.

[02:24:44.490 --> 02:24:45.110]
Go ahead.

[02:24:45.850 --> 02:24:46.450]
Yeah, huh?

[02:24:46.970 --> 02:24:47.630]
WQA, hello.

[02:24:48.090 --> 02:24:48.790]
Don't mind me.

[02:24:48.950 --> 02:24:49.690]
I'm just pooping.

[02:24:50.570 --> 02:24:51.230]
WQA, hello.

[02:24:52.650 --> 02:24:55.810]
Yeah, when I called you earlier today and asked you to play that bidet.

[02:24:55.810 --> 02:24:57.210]
You called me earlier today?

[02:24:58.070 --> 02:24:59.570]
About the automobile thing.

[02:24:59.690 --> 02:25:01.670]
You're calling again a second time today.

[02:25:01.890 --> 02:25:02.870]
What do you try to tell us, sir?

[02:25:02.890 --> 02:25:03.430]
I have no luck.

[02:25:03.910 --> 02:25:06.670]
You asked me why I didn't say hello, Neil and all that.

[02:25:06.670 --> 02:25:07.230]
Right.

[02:25:07.490 --> 02:25:09.550]
Well, everybody else said that he why should I?

[02:25:10.270 --> 02:25:12.650]
Because it's a common courtesy.

[02:25:12.890 --> 02:25:15.730]
When you pick up the phone and you call somebody, you say hello, Schmengrick.

[02:25:15.890 --> 02:25:16.710]
Hello, Schmengrick.

[02:25:16.830 --> 02:25:17.830]
In your case, look in the mirror.

[02:25:18.090 --> 02:25:19.210]
You'll see Schmengrick, okay?

[02:25:19.450 --> 02:25:23.850]
You'll see Schmengrick, Schlemazel, Schmengeggi, Schmuck, all of these things.

[02:25:23.990 --> 02:25:24.650]
All of these things.

[02:25:24.830 --> 02:25:25.470]
That's what you'll see.

[02:25:25.650 --> 02:25:26.430]
Call me earlier today.

[02:25:27.810 --> 02:25:29.430]
This is the software model, baby.

[02:25:29.530 --> 02:25:29.870]
I have no luck.

[02:25:29.890 --> 02:25:30.950]
Get yourself a t-shirt.

[02:25:31.070 --> 02:25:31.590]
I have no luck.

[02:25:31.610 --> 02:25:32.130]
Run around.

[02:25:32.250 --> 02:25:33.350]
Get a sandwich board.

[02:25:33.450 --> 02:25:33.990]
I have no luck.

[02:25:35.090 --> 02:25:35.710]
WQA, hello.

[02:25:35.710 --> 02:25:37.170]
Hello, Neil.

[02:25:37.650 --> 02:25:38.030]
Yes, sir.

[02:25:38.230 --> 02:25:38.710]
Yes, sir.

[02:25:38.970 --> 02:25:39.510]
Hey, listen.

[02:25:41.290 --> 02:25:45.970]
What does Hank Olberg, does he, the biggest name-dropper we know?

[02:25:46.490 --> 02:25:47.650]
I'm going to calm up and ask him.

[02:25:47.750 --> 02:25:48.450]
It's a really good idea.

[02:25:48.710 --> 02:25:49.590]
Calm up and find out.

[02:25:50.150 --> 02:25:50.810]
WQA, hello.

[02:25:51.670 --> 02:25:52.690]
You know who I am?

[02:25:52.930 --> 02:25:53.650]
I'm no green.

[02:25:53.810 --> 02:25:54.970]
I made my balls with you.

[02:25:55.750 --> 02:25:56.430]
WQA, hello.

[02:25:57.910 --> 02:25:58.690]
QA, hello.

[02:25:59.370 --> 02:25:59.810]
WQA, hello.

[02:25:59.810 --> 02:26:00.610]
Boy, not good.

[02:26:00.930 --> 02:26:01.570]
WQA, hello.

[02:26:02.530 --> 02:26:03.630]
I like that one.

[02:26:05.130 --> 02:26:05.690]
WQA, hello.

[02:26:05.690 --> 02:26:05.690]

[02:26:05.690 --> 02:26:05.690]

[02:26:05.690 --> 02:26:05.690]

[02:26:06.670 --> 02:26:08.390]
I just tell me what you want.

[02:26:10.110 --> 02:26:10.750]
WQA, hello.

[02:26:11.950 --> 02:26:13.250]

[02:26:13.270 --> 02:26:13.610]
Yes, sir.

[02:26:15.850 --> 02:26:17.570]
I think we're going to fix line one, by the way.

[02:26:17.590 --> 02:26:17.670]
No.

[02:26:17.670 --> 02:26:18.510]
We're going to need one more line.

[02:26:18.850 --> 02:26:19.470]
QA, hello.

[02:26:20.150 --> 02:26:21.010]
I am, Leo.

[02:26:22.890 --> 02:26:23.570]
WQA, hello.

[02:26:24.410 --> 02:26:25.930]
Yes, sir.

[02:26:28.330 --> 02:26:28.550]
Yes, sir.

[02:26:29.930 --> 02:26:30.490]
Yes, sir.

[02:26:30.490 --> 02:26:31.330]
Yes, sir.

[02:26:31.330 --> 02:26:31.790]
Yes, sir.

[02:26:31.790 --> 02:26:31.910]
Yes, sir.

[02:26:32.150 --> 02:26:32.230]

[02:26:34.710 --> 02:26:34.750]
Yes, sir.

[02:26:34.750 --> 02:26:34.750]

[02:26:34.850 --> 02:26:35.410]
Yes, sir.

[02:26:35.410 --> 02:26:37.610]
I don't want to say anything against me!

[02:26:38.690 --> 02:26:38.690]

[02:26:38.850 --> 02:26:38.850]

[02:26:38.850 --> 02:26:40.750]
I can't say what he's doing.

[02:26:40.890 --> 02:26:42.110]
But it feels like he has done it.

[02:26:45.030 --> 02:26:46.110]
Reagan actually arrested a kinds of experts for the

[02:26:46.110 --> 02:26:46.110]

[02:26:46.110 --> 02:26:51.290]
I was not dealing with God.

[02:26:53.350 --> 02:26:54.290]
I was just trying to fix it.

[02:26:54.290 --> 02:26:54.290]

[02:26:54.290 --> 02:26:54.290]

[02:26:54.290 --> 02:26:54.290]

[02:26:54.290 --> 02:26:54.290]

[02:26:54.290 --> 02:26:54.290]

[02:26:54.290 --> 02:26:54.290]

[02:26:54.290 --> 02:26:54.450]
Man, for evil.

[02:26:54.450 --> 02:26:54.450]

[02:26:54.450 --> 02:26:56.190]
Are you taking my habbitises away?

[02:26:56.190 --> 02:26:57.130]
Hmm, I'll think.

[02:26:57.130 --> 02:26:57.890]
I'll take my otter's easy.

[02:26:58.430 --> 02:26:58.990]
ennial downgrowings.

[02:26:58.990 --> 02:27:02.330]
He's like a traitor!

[02:27:02.330 --> 02:27:04.690]
He's a traitor!

[02:27:04.690 --> 02:27:04.830]
When did this come?

[02:27:04.830 --> 02:27:05.170]
When did I come?

[02:27:05.170 --> 02:27:10.510]
rob of skeletal women by the pool. They like my nice back. I got to play in Strip

[02:27:10.510 --> 02:27:21.850]
Marjot. But I want to tell you, these boys look like my true orfantraig. Boy, I

[02:27:21.850 --> 02:27:27.410]
stoked on it, huh? But you wish I had me back. Well, not had your life. No chance. You'll

[02:27:27.410 --> 02:27:32.710]
have a semi in that smelly dump again. See? Well, yeah, maybe.

[02:27:33.010 --> 02:27:36.670]
Love a 32. By the way, have a nice day, Mo. You know, he's listening right now. They're

[02:27:36.670 --> 02:27:40.410]
blood, okay, or not. Mo is the case, maybe. Whatever makes you happy. Whatever makes you

[02:27:40.410 --> 02:27:44.950]
miserable and unhappy. And those around you, love 158 votes on the pool. We need, you

[02:27:44.950 --> 02:27:50.570]
know, we could still do it. What do you think, Chris? People really want to be nice. We

[02:27:50.570 --> 02:27:56.530]
can do it. Nice. Yeah, that would be nice. I think tonight, I guess, I don't know.

[02:27:56.890 --> 02:28:01.810]
Depends on how long I stay with mine. How much I lose. I was going to say we're going

[02:28:01.810 --> 02:28:05.890]
to watch Borat. The one is actually, I can watch with English. And what's the difference

[02:28:05.890 --> 02:28:09.450]
between this one you sent me now? Because they have one like Portuguese subtitle or something?

[02:28:10.430 --> 02:28:15.530]
Yeah, something. This one has the real deal DVD English subtitles, which is about half

[02:28:15.530 --> 02:28:22.190]
the jokes are actually subtitled. And it's great. And also like all the scenes that didn't

[02:28:22.190 --> 02:28:25.190]
make it into the theater version because of length, you know how that goes. Yeah.

[02:28:25.650 --> 02:28:31.930]
Bing bang bang bang bang. Bing bang. Bing bang bang.

[02:28:34.910 --> 02:28:35.790]
Bing bang bang.

[02:28:35.790 --> 02:28:41.850]
Very nice. Very nice. So I'm going to watch it because that thing kind of threw me any

[02:28:41.850 --> 02:28:48.690]
way we need 42 votes in 27 minutes. That's less than two a minute to get to 1200. But

[02:28:48.690 --> 02:28:51.410]
I think this thing is frozen again. I'm just starting to get a little bit suspicious.

[02:28:51.410 --> 02:28:56.810]
is Eric I think is dibbling with us today you know. Don't you it's still stuck

[02:28:56.810 --> 02:29:01.970]
there 11.58 I keep refreshing it I know we got a shot and it's still every time I

[02:29:01.970 --> 02:29:04.650]
refresh it it still stays there so maybe nobody is listening you think that's

[02:29:04.650 --> 02:29:11.110]
possible we have had 21 drop out. 11.59 what 11.59 we have had 21 drop outs on

[02:29:11.110 --> 02:29:15.730]
our on our thing I'm gonna send our my space one of my phone oh we got a few

[02:29:15.730 --> 02:29:20.010]
drop outs on our my space make no mistake about that and you know I never

[02:29:20.410 --> 02:29:23.570]
checked I double-checked a see if Christopher did his research and

[02:29:23.570 --> 02:29:26.870]
rechecked it on sure what thing and he never followed up on it you know all you

[02:29:26.870 --> 02:29:29.510]
wanted to do is give me to play a old needle again which I didn't and that was

[02:29:29.510 --> 02:29:36.070]
the end of that you know I'm easy I'm easy Chris 1160 votes they're coming in

[02:29:36.070 --> 02:29:39.630]
by the ones say we're gonna need 40 votes in 26 minutes and I do the math as

[02:29:39.630 --> 02:29:42.650]
they say and that's another one we should add on a pull-ass right to do the math

[02:29:42.650 --> 02:29:45.690]
right I mentioned it but I don't think we ever put it on there that is so

[02:29:45.690 --> 02:29:49.430]
freaking annoying 11.61 they're just trickling in by the ones I think we better go

[02:29:49.430 --> 02:29:54.410]
back to the bedtime story starting tomorrow I think I chased the entire

[02:29:54.410 --> 02:29:57.490]
audience and when I think the audience chased the audience away here's a

[02:29:57.490 --> 02:30:00.890]
facts while we're waiting for the votes to pour up and you'll see there I'll

[02:30:00.890 --> 02:30:03.450]
click on one of these times and be a big chunk they'll come through for us you'll

[02:30:03.450 --> 02:30:10.050]
see 11.63 see there's two there's a pair oh what a pair here's a note from

[02:30:10.050 --> 02:30:14.090]
Frank and Melbourne he says a note on Judge Larry Court of the Pottsmoker we

[02:30:14.090 --> 02:30:17.970]
talked about that story yesterday I had a family location from a court a few

[02:30:17.970 --> 02:30:21.530]
years ago my ex had taken our child out of state to find a court order not to do

[02:30:21.530 --> 02:30:25.930]
so I managed to find who we get her served she and her new hubby show up he's a

[02:30:25.930 --> 02:30:30.470]
rich eye doctor that holds surgical patients my argument was to have the court

[02:30:30.470 --> 02:30:33.050]
take the child from the ex-dude who are having fled the state and not allowing

[02:30:33.050 --> 02:30:36.690]
visitation according to Florida case law court a should of switch custody

[02:30:37.410 --> 02:30:41.390]
instead after a morning of arguing courted a Claire's a lunchtime break we all

[02:30:41.390 --> 02:30:44.710]
leave but the judges an hour late he claimed to have had a flat tire but the

[02:30:48.830 --> 02:30:52.130]
was they and my child let the court's jurisdiction and even if court had ruled

[02:30:52.130 --> 02:30:57.730]
for me my daughter was gone took a bribe had a flat had a talk who knows justice

[02:30:57.730 --> 02:31:01.710]
forget about it says Frank he says yes I'm gonna turn you this new show every day

[02:31:01.710 --> 02:31:05.050]
thank you Frank and Melbourne and I'm so sorry that you know Judge Court had a

[02:31:05.050 --> 02:31:09.210]
lot of smoke a big fat one or whatever he was doing how do you like that huh

[02:31:10.390 --> 02:31:17.410]

[02:31:30.250 --> 02:31:34.630]
advance and they're all doing anything if it's still warm they're doing it if

[02:31:34.630 --> 02:31:38.730]
it's a warm blow-up dollar doing it even if it's lukewarm or if it's like

[02:31:38.730 --> 02:31:44.210]
luke and Matthew 1171 we need 29 votes in 24 minutes that's barely over one

[02:31:44.210 --> 02:31:47.830]
minute now don't you think a high-priced legendary show like this ought to be

[02:31:47.830 --> 02:31:52.830]
able to do that okay but it's just I keep refreshing and ordinarily there's

[02:31:52.830 --> 02:31:57.190]
you know here for more here 1172 they're coming by the ones they're coming

[02:31:57.190 --> 02:32:04.050]

[02:32:31.470 --> 02:32:35.030]
ourselves either that or Eric is a didliner and then all of a sudden he'll open

the thing up again there'd be like 240 at the end we need 28 votes in 23

[02:32:40.350 --> 02:32:43.990]
minutes on this show that should be a no-brainer to get to our twelve hundred

[02:32:43.990 --> 02:32:48.070]
to get to our goal to make us feel good about this show is in spread of these

[02:32:48.070 --> 02:32:54.610]
calls it's spread of these re-mouth breathing idiots 1173 see I'm thinking

other buddy on here what not on the year but what a grasser is I'm not going to

[02:35:53.570 --> 02:35:57.590]
tell that whole story I'll send it to him but a grasser I mean is that just a

[02:35:57.590 --> 02:36:00.410]
name I made up or was it something we just did a Michigan stator they have

[02:36:00.410 --> 02:36:06.690]
that everywhere a grasser I would never heard that when you heard me tell the

[02:36:06.690 --> 02:36:11.570]
story many times yeah a grasser is when a bunch of like college guys like for

[02:36:11.570 --> 02:36:14.950]
there's like a place in the woods you know no matter where you live there's

[02:36:14.950 --> 02:36:21.670]
always going to be some woods somewhere right well why are you like it's like

[02:36:21.670 --> 02:36:25.070]
like you don't like I'm speaking a foreign language and you think a bunch of

[02:36:25.070 --> 02:36:29.630]
blankets and take a carload of broads and booze and whatever goes with it the

[02:36:29.630 --> 02:36:32.910]
three bees blankets booze and broads and you go out in the woods and you like

[02:36:32.910 --> 02:36:38.010]
school you grasser you're grasser right you throw away your grasser you're you

[02:36:38.010 --> 02:36:41.590]
answer yeah I don't answer a question I've never heard of that before you I'm an

[02:36:41.590 --> 02:36:45.850]
old bag you know or young fact called it party and but that's well in college it

[02:36:45.850 --> 02:36:49.090]
was a grasser that's what I call a Michigan state it was a grasser a

[02:36:49.090 --> 02:36:53.930]
stretch court in health and he likes his grassers in fact I left my watch and

[02:36:53.930 --> 02:36:58.370]
my grassers right out there that's I'm gonna ruin the story I don't want to tell

[02:36:58.370 --> 02:37:01.970]
the whole story because I've told it a hundred times on the air but that's a

[02:37:01.970 --> 02:37:05.590]
grasser is what it is and I mean I guess I do have to explain it because maybe

[02:37:05.590 --> 02:37:09.050]
maybe maybe that's just a word that the kids made out how do I know you know when

[02:37:09.050 --> 02:37:13.510]
you're in college your people kids make up all kinds of crap because there's

[02:37:13.510 --> 02:37:16.150]
no way you're there for to be a smart ass and does not to learn anything I

[02:37:16.150 --> 02:37:19.870]
didn't learn a smart thing and like I've told you a million times it's a damn

[02:37:19.870 --> 02:37:23.850]
good thing that I'm trying to think if there was anybody in my I'm I for in my

[02:37:23.850 --> 02:37:26.650]
dorm in each hall hall as you can see if there was any guy that really looked

[02:37:26.650 --> 02:37:32.310]
even close to good and I went no they were all ugly because they would have

[02:37:32.310 --> 02:37:35.730]
been pretty all though as a matter of fact they did catch a couple of guys they

[02:37:35.730 --> 02:37:41.330]
yeah and my on my floor I don't remember who they were and they were ugly too

[02:37:41.330 --> 02:37:44.590]
but they cut a couple of guys in the sack doing hankies thank you with each

[02:37:44.590 --> 02:37:50.230]
other how do you like that or her yeah how do you like that kind of guy and of

[02:37:50.230 --> 02:37:53.830]
course you know can you imagine having to to live that down afterward oh boy

[02:37:56.110 --> 02:37:59.550]
wow I would have changed underwear and changed dormitories and changed schools

[02:37:59.550 --> 02:38:04.550]
and changed the planets I mean that of course this is back in early in 60-61

[02:38:04.550 --> 02:38:09.490]
hundred years ago I was in college and you know what a bunch of you see there's

[02:38:09.490 --> 02:38:13.590]
nothing more vicious more rotten than kids as you know little kids especially

[02:38:13.590 --> 02:38:17.310]
but of course college kids because they're smart asses in college you know right

[02:38:17.310 --> 02:38:22.730]
oh yeah and so you've got somebody that you found out is a gay or is like well

[02:38:22.730 --> 02:38:25.690]
whatever you know or likes to wear ladies underwear or whatever it is and you

[02:38:25.690 --> 02:38:29.850]
catch him in the act of putting on the ladies underwear or in the act of you

[02:38:29.850 --> 02:38:32.910]
know hankies spank you with each other in the dorm room while I think you know

[02:38:32.910 --> 02:38:35.590]
when you think you'd lock the freaking door maybe the roommate came in you know

[02:38:35.950 --> 02:38:39.530]
that's probably got to be a very unsettling sound when you hear the key in the

[02:38:39.530 --> 02:38:42.490]
door oh probably if they were like in the heat of passionate in here the key

[02:38:42.490 --> 02:38:48.290]
in the door that's right probably a lot of any breathing going on you know so

[02:38:48.290 --> 02:38:51.350]
you don't hear that key in the door and only for doing it all and the door

[02:38:51.350 --> 02:38:58.050]
squeaks open and oh no what's going on in here what are you laughing about

[02:38:58.050 --> 02:39:04.130]
yeah that would be can you imagine anything more rather not well not good in

[02:39:04.130 --> 02:39:07.450]
fact all these years I kind of I don't know I didn't block it out like and oh

[02:39:07.450 --> 02:39:12.970]
we got 1194 we're gonna make our 1200 votes let's hear it all right this is

[02:39:12.970 --> 02:39:16.430]
almost like a crazy but we can go Monday we can go well whenever the hell it was

[02:39:16.430 --> 02:39:19.670]
remember that day when we got 1500 and some votes during the show back when we

[02:39:19.670 --> 02:39:33.750]
still had an audience remember that but when you come right down to it I mean

[02:39:33.750 --> 02:39:36.570]
what's the big deal of 90 we don't even have the 1200 yet so that was a

[02:39:36.570 --> 02:39:41.250]
premature evaluation but but up until I started telling the story about the

[02:39:41.250 --> 02:39:44.070]
grasser in fact I'm flicking this and it's still up 94 that would be pretty

[02:39:44.070 --> 02:39:46.770]
embarrassing if we don't get the other six votes so some of you who voted me

[02:39:46.770 --> 02:39:49.910]
for please do it again to make sure we get it because otherwise I would have

[02:39:49.910 --> 02:39:53.510]
gone through all that effort to play all it's still a 94 I think Eric is got

[02:39:53.510 --> 02:39:58.830]
his foot on a break this is a very spastic day here on this

[02:39:58.830 --> 02:40:04.910]
internet you know 1195 now there's one oh the big news on CNN grassfire in

[02:40:04.910 --> 02:40:10.670]
Miami oh my God I showed W Channel 7 WSVN now the rest of the world can

[02:40:10.670 --> 02:40:15.370]
understand how depressing it is to live in Miami grassfire I wonder where the

[02:40:15.370 --> 02:40:18.910]
hell it is they're having a grasser and it got out of there were having a

[02:40:18.910 --> 02:40:24.130]
