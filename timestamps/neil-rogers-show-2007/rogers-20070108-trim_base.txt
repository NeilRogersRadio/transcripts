[00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:04.200]
I'm glad the holiday season is dead.

[00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:05.520]
Yes.

[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.380]
Had enough work but it wasn't no club man.

[00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.220]
And now there's an egg in inside my head.

[00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:19.580]
But still got light up on your home.

[00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.640]
But after midnight, I'm telling you everyone.

[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.320]
Should have taken them down.

[00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.820]
Take them down, you lazy bum.

[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.240]
You need a job to feel the aims to top, top, top, top.

[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.120]
One down the line.

[00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:35.360]
Take down the line.

[00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:36.420]
Should have backed them up.

[00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.860]
Can you wear me one, one, one?

[00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:38.180]
Three.

[00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:39.860]
Who cares?

[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:40.720]
596.

[00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:41.640]
A very strong second.

[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:42.300]
That's what I voted.

[00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:43.260]
Who cares?

[00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:44.520]
Who gives a flying choice?

[00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.100]
Liar 348.

[00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:49.700]
Is that streaming gonna stay down?

[00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:50.680]
No, it's back up again.

[00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.680]
But we've had a dozen dropouts in five minutes.

[00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.540]
Coward 198.

[00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.320]
Who's next saving 186?

[00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.440]
Loser 161.

[00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:59.140]
Loser.

[00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.840]
Absolutely correct sir.

[00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.100]
Great coach, 51.

[00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.520]
That's the joke vote I guess for Friday's poll.

[00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.600]
Trigger 46 and I hate this poll.

[00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:07.460]
Only 24.

[00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:08.700]
Solventay Uno.

[00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:10.300]
Only 1%.

[00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.120]
They liked it.

[00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.900]
Well it's something to them to get all whipped up about.

[00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.560]
It's gotta always be something negative in South Florida.

[00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:18.880]
We hate you know.

[00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.700]
Camplin revises Roller Q.A.

[00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.040]
Oh anyway before we get to that, here's today's poll.

[00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.940]
Speak in a hate.

[00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.540]
Yeah.

[00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.920]
Well.

[00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.660]
He's a freaking genius 248.

[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.680]
If I'm such a genius, then how come I'm working for these people?

[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:32.580]
That's my question.

[00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.960]
People that can't even get a facts sent from your house to their ass.

[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.540]
Those bedtime stories 32.

[00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.940]
See that's contrary to your thinking.

[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.500]
To hear him suffer 27.

[00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.180]
18 dropouts and it's dead again.

[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.620]
It's down.

[00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:05.660]
The streaming is down.

[00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.740]
Let's back up.

[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:07.100]
18.

[00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.180]
So very jackass rights.

[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.480]
Ed Camplin, whose late night talk show was dropped recently by WQM5.

[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:17.460]
60 cents Saturday.

[00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.280]
He'll remain at the station with a new rule.

[00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.620]
Camplin will be the host on the show from 7 to 10 p.m.

[00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.560]
Week nights when WQM doesn't have a game.

[00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.180]
Which is not tonight.

[00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:29.840]
The stands for nothing.

[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:30.400]
Absolutely.

[00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.540]
They're married men who now walk with a spring in their step.

[00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:35.820]
Did you lose weight though?

[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.460]
Their wives are happier now that their husbands have talked to their doctor.

[00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:45.380]
Tonight on Dateline NBC, join me, Chris Hansen, as we take a look into prescription

[00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.100]
male enhancement products.

[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.360]
This is just like any other middle class neighborhood.

[00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:52.800]
And this is Bob.

[00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.100]
Bob talked to his doctor and got a prescription for enzyme, the male enhancement.

[00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.560]
What are you doing here Bob?

[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.520]
God, who are prescription male enhancement?

[00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:05.800]
How did you get my bedroom?

[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.380]
It's not looking at my wife.

[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:08.700]
What's going on?

[00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.760]
Tonight on Dateline NBC.

[00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:12.420]
Who is that honey?

[00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.080]
It's a Chris guy from Dateline.

[00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:16.460]
Want a lollipop little boy?

[00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:17.920]
10, 16 to 5, 60.

[00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.240]
So anyway, here's a reply.

[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.200]
I've got a tree now to my blog already.

[00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.780]
Not exciting.

[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.300]
But the only reason I'm going to read this one is because it's interesting.

[00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:26.720]
And it's from Allied Radio.

[00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.040]
Who the hell is Allied Radio?

[00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:29.200]
Do we know what does that mean?

[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:30.160]
I don't know.

[00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.700]
It's somebody.

[00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:31.760]
Some guy.

[00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.080]
Anyway, it says, you know, I don't find that stuff boring at all.

[00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.800]
In other words, am I talking about the Myspace crap?

[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.900]
It says, I guess it's because I know what you're talking about.

[00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:38.920]
So, we'll be correct.

[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.280]
Sure.

[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:41.640]
698 in the pool.

[00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:42.980]
We're going to have, well, we might make our thoughts.

[00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:43.580]
I don't know.

[00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.080]
So, Josh is training Chris today.

[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.620]
Is that the deal?

[00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.100]
Yeah, he's sitting next to me right now.

[00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.920]
Sitting on your lap?

[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.620]
Yes.

[00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.380]
You should see it.

[00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:53.700]
They're facing each other.

[00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:55.260]
They're facing each other.

[00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:56.160]
They're giving good face.

[00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.900]
Well, whatever.

[00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.480]
Here's the fact that came in this morning from Lew and Tammy.

[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.560]
We listen to you for multiple reasons, for a laugh, for multiple orgasms,

[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.980]
for a laugh, for the stories, for the way you reacted to the calls,

[00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.940]
and for your genius.

[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.120]
All I'm a genius is looking at people I'm working for.

[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.380]
We've got 37 dropouts on the screen.

[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:14.500]
We've been on for 18 minutes.

[00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.160]
Keeping our pace of two a minute and then a little bit extra,

[00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:20.380]
just like I said, for a clear suck on the ear.

[00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.580]
But those tapes are, first of all, there's not going to be any tapes.

[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.220]
Okay?

[00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.380]
Because there isn't going to be any extension.

[00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.080]
I'm not, yeah, I've got two years to go less a week.

[00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:31.040]
Not that I'm counting.

[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.620]
In fact, on the blog, I'm going to figure out exactly how many days I have left

[00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.180]
in my two years, and counting them down on the blog on Myspace.

[00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.680]
Well, you can put a countdown time around your Myspace.

[00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.560]
Can I?

[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.180]
Sure.

[00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.660]
How do you do that?

[00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.900]
Well, you can help me with that, since you're the technical wizard.

[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.520]
Right.

[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.100]
Anyway, getting back to this, I don't want to get all whipped up about this,

[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:50.880]
because what's the point?

[00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:54.120]
Nothing is ever going to change with this after if there isn't food that a long time ago.

[00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.940]
If you want to see any commentator or any talking head on TV who really tells the truth

[00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.000]
and tells it like it is, and it's got a big, gigantic pair,

[00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:06.820]
then he's the guy in MSNBC, 8 to 9 PM on countdown nightly, Keith Oberman,

[00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:07.980]
MSNBC.

[00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.180]
I know almost to be under the age of 100 don't watch MSNBC,

[00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:15.040]
and certainly, hopefully, don't watch CNN, and that propaganda like Wolf Blitzkrieg,

[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:15.520]
that crap.

[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.100]
700 main reason I listen to Neil is, for laughs, total 9 to think,

[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.160]
because in honor of the fact that everything is technically so screwed up,

[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:27.800]
since they listen for laughs, I'm thinking, I can put that like on an end of the loop,

[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.100]
and just look so cool, if that's what you're talking about.

[00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.620]
There you go, right?

[00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:30.320]
Huh?

[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:32.260]
What do you think?

[00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:38.980]
And then maybe every now and then just a variety,

[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:40.680]
throwing something a little bit different.

[00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:52.900]
Yeah, what's that?

[00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:54.540]
Let's laugh about that a little bit.

[00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.360]
I know, it really gets my panties in a while.

[00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:57.940]
Cut it out.

[00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:00.160]
Calm down.

[00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:02.680]
728 votes on the poll.

[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:06.880]
The main reason I listen to Neil is, for laughs, 299.

[00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:09.240]
Anybody want to camel?

[00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.060]
He's a freaking genius, 275.

[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:13.540]
I walk a mile for a camel.

[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:17.560]
You know, it's too bad all you punks for a 200 remember when we had a cigarette advertising,

[00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:18.980]
the Faggot advertising on TV.

[00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:20.020]
I remember.

[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.120]
Lucky Streck means, fine tobacco, LSD,

[00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:26.220]
and FT call for Philip Morris that was Johnny,

[00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:28.620]
he was the little guy, little midget guy.

[00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:34.100]
Let's see, here's the fact that it's just trying to listen on Jonathan's plantation.

[00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:35.920]
I've been telling you that you can't listen online.

[00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:38.680]
It says, it's next to impossible today, that's right,

[00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:41.000]
because we've got 51 dropouts in 24 minutes to be.

[00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:46.260]
Biker and Blykker and fourth in New York City is where the source of the,

[00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:49.400]
boy, it must be some heavy duty farting, huh?

[00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:51.660]
It must have been an Mexican fiesta over the weekend, think?

[00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:53.240]
Maybe Taco Bell, right?

[00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:56.060]
Maybe Taco Bell was given a two-for-one burrito or something.

[00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.220]
I still haven't get it over to Taco Bell lately.

[00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:00.220]
I apologize to myself for tonight.

[00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:03.280]
I love Taco Bell, and even the smell.

[00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:07.200]
738, and I never finished reading this.

[00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:09.980]
For last 304, he's a freaking genius to 80 ride.

[00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:17.080]
Those bedtime stories, 36, 53 dropouts in 26 minutes to hear him suffer 31 like today,

[00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.860]
because QM is a technical disaster A industry joke.

[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.800]
The crazy caller is 28. I'm bored 23.

[00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:26.920]
I hate this pull 23. I break from all sports 12, and I hate Neil back.

[00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:28.840]
Just like our management does, 11.

[00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:29.780]
Sounds small business.

[00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:31.440]
Congratulations, get alive.

[00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:32.980]
I feel good.

[00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:34.220]
Pete and I are here in heaven.

[00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:34.760]
Bye!

[00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:36.440]
It's President Jareb R4.

[00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:39.680]
Hello, James Brown, hardest working man in show business.

[00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:42.880]
You know that song, Hot Pants, has always been one of my favorites.

[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:43.720]
Take it, Jareb.

[00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:45.180]
I've always considered you a great man.

[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:47.280]
And as you know, it's a man's world.

[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:48.260]
In for those!

[00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:49.740]
Saddam Hussein.

[00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:50.540]
How did he get here?

[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:51.520]
I don't know.

[00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:52.840]
I'll call St. Peter.

[00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:54.220]
He's one of my favorite five.

[00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:55.340]
Hello, St. Pete.

[00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:56.620]
It's Gerald Ford.

[00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:57.740]
I don't know how to finally know him.

[00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:00.120]
You know Saddam Hussein is here with us, right?

[00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:00.880]
I don't know.

[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:02.560]
I don't know.

[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:03.360]
Typo?

[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:04.140]
I see.

[00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:05.820]
Okay, thank you.

[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:06.580]
What did he say?

[00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:07.100]
Good job.

[00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:08.980]
Wait for it.

[00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:10.820]
Get it from the other hand.

[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:12.200]
Okay.

[00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:13.260]
I'm in.

[00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:15.620]
1031, we're almost keeping up with that.

[00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:18.260]
We have 59 dropouts, but the streaming is back up.

[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:20.000]
It'll stay there for a couple of seconds.

[00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:21.400]
It'll drop out again and back up.

[00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:22.380]
And nobody can listen online.

[00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:23.500]
Very good, Joe.

[00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:24.200]
You're really doing it.

[00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.680]
You want to crack engineering staff viewers.

[00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:27.340]
The Beesley production, baby.

[00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:28.720]
I'm not holding anything back anymore.

[00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:31.360]
These people are a joke.

[00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:33.040]
They're an industry joke.

[00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:34.220]
They're an insult to my intelligence.

[00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:35.960]
I have to work in the business for about 100 years.

[00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:40.200]
I've never seen so many people with such little professionalism.

[00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:40.820]
It's schlock.

[00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:43.420]
You know, fish off in the morning and fake your way through the day

[00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:44.740]
and schlock your way through life.

[00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:47.260]
It's a schlockhouse.

[00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:50.820]
59 dropouts, 750 votes on a pool.

[00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:51.840]
All the numbers all the time.

[00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:53.940]
WDQYM, hello.

[00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:56.620]
Yes, sir.

[00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:58.220]
I'm sorry I just shut off the radio.

[00:08:59.080 --> 00:08:59.800]
Good morning.

[00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:00.640]
Good morning.

[00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:04.040]
I had so much excitement and pleasure

[00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:06.560]
after viewing the Patriots' win yesterday.

[00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:13.180]
It was on that final play, the return to reception for a touch now.

[00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:14.760]
I'm Brady.

[00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:17.660]
Had that defensive back in his arms and I said,

[00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:20.160]
oh my, what do you like to have been there?

[00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:20.700]
Yes.

[00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:24.180]
Okay, good thinking, pal.

[00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:25.400]
You're right on target all the way around.

[00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:27.160]
Would I like to be in Tom Brady's arms?

[00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:27.740]
You bet.

[00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.620]
I wouldn't mind being in Ryan Phillips arms in that movie.

[00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:31.280]
I saw last night.

[00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:32.260]
I never mentioned that on the year.

[00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:33.760]
I saw what you did last summer.

[00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:35.020]
I know it's all.

[00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:36.000]
I saw who you did.

[00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:38.200]
I know who you did last summer.

[00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:39.420]
I know who you did last summer.

[00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:41.880]
In a Ryan Phillips case, believe me, it would be a long list.

[00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:43.400]
Boy, he sure looked good in that movie.

[00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:45.580]
Man, he wasn't talking like this.

[00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:47.700]
He talked like a real hot punk.

[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:50.260]
You know, I might have liked that movie if you weren't talking like this.

[00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:52.260]
He wasn't talking like that at all.

[00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:54.280]
And who else was in that?

[00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:54.840]
What's his name?

[00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:56.620]
Freddie Prinz, Jr.?

[00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:59.060]
He looked pretty good, too, but you know something I always liked him.

[00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:00.500]
I thought he was kind of a...

[00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:02.300]
I don't dislike him as much as I wanted to.

[00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:05.240]
I'm talking about how he looks and I'm talking about his acting.

[00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:06.360]
No, he's adequate.

[00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:06.900]
He's okay.

[00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:09.820]
I have a relation about the fact that we aren't streaming our show right now

[00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:11.000]
and haven't been for many minutes.

[00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:11.980]
No.

[00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:13.120]
Well, why not?

[00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:14.800]
Well, just weren't told him.

[00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:16.840]
We're back up again.

[00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:18.940]
62 drafts, but we're back up.

[00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:21.340]
Who did you tell, Josh?

[00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:22.700]
No, he's out of the room.

[00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:23.400]
Oh.

[00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:26.900]
He's out there screaming and yelling and banging on the door and engineering.

[00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:27.340]
You morons!

[00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:31.400]
What are you doing to the neorodgers, you're again, you idiots, you lunatics!

[00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:34.080]
But, you know, you had it right when you suspected it.

[00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:36.740]
It probably wasn't on, you know, anyone's end.

[00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:38.460]
It wasn't what?

[00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:40.580]
It wasn't what?

[00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:44.060]
Probably not on anyone's particular end, if you know what I mean.

[00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:46.840]
Like something wrong with the line again.

[00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:50.060]
I'm assuming you're talking about?

[00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:50.600]
Yeah.

[00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:53.540]
Are you sure?

[00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:54.080]
No.

[00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:58.180]
I wouldn't put anything past that bunch of...

[00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:01.040]
I mean, the fact that we go through an entire day last week

[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:04.080]
in a major market radio station and we can't send the facts,

[00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:06.940]
we can't send a freaking facts.

[00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:12.020]
Jesus Christ, they're going to have to get us a new building.

[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:15.520]
They're close to kinkos or staples or something like that.

[00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:18.420]
What kind of goofball, huh?

[00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:21.340]
That's a good idea, maybe if they've moved it downstairs or something.

[00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:22.320]
A kinkos.

[00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:25.320]
If they move lockdown stairs.

[00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:26.560]
Like a...

[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:27.560]
What is downstairs?

[00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:29.040]
Now I know the credit unions go on.

[00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:30.020]
What's downstairs now?

[00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:31.940]
Oh, it was empty for a long time.

[00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:36.120]
Just now they remodeled it and they got like some world financial or something.

[00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:37.920]
I bet you they got a facts machine.

[00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:38.260]
Probably.

[00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:39.060]
It works too.

[00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:41.500]
The dentist office downstairs too, probably.

[00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:43.220]
And I bet you the dentist has an orifice too.

[00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:45.520]
WQIM, hello.

[00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:46.380]
Neil!

[00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:47.220]
Yes, sir.

[00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:48.920]
I love your show, man.

[00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:55.080]
I'm all for science and research and stuff but the cloning thing,

[00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:56.300]
I can't figure why.

[00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:59.400]
Why do they want to clone animals?

[00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:03.520]
I mean, don't we have a shortage of chickens and cows or something?

[00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:04.160]
No.

[00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:05.840]
I don't know what's going on.

[00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:07.200]
Anyway, I really love your show.

[00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:13.480]
Could you play that thing that used to be the girl from Empazema, Empazema?

[00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:15.600]
The girl with Empazema, you got it, Pali.

[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:16.560]
Thank you, Neil.

[00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:19.380]
Okay, if you got him a smoking baby, and the S-faggot's too.

[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:23.980]
Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da.

[00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:26.100]
Let's see, that's the other word, a girl with Empazema.

[00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:28.160]
Coming up by any moment.

[00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:32.400]
I might play it till two o'clock because I'm so nauseated and disgusted with all the stuff that's going on there.

[00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:35.400]
Hey, smokey, Joe, let me tell you something, man.

[00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:37.520]
You have really changed my altitude a lot.

[00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:40.000]
And a start with that really crappy lunch too.

[00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:40.480]
That's steak.

[00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:43.200]
I wouldn't feed that steak to my dog if they were still alive.

[00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:45.060]
They were the evening, though.

[00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:46.400]
That's the problem with them.

[00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:46.740]
Oh, yeah.

[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.880]
My mother killed Tiny.

[00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:49.540]
You know that.

[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:55.880]
Every time we come back from vacation, that dog would have pancreateitis, and he'd have that look on his face.

[00:12:56.400 --> 00:13:00.200]
By the way, Jason and Pendle stopped trying to facts that article about Jared Lido.

[00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:02.720]
It's not coming through, and it's just a tiny up the machine.

[00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:04.380]
She's got an article about Jared Lido.

[00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:05.340]
I want to see it right now.

[00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:05.920]
No, that's okay.

[00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:07.160]
I don't naked right on.

[00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:08.940]
I want to see Ryan for Leap now.

[00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:10.380]
See, that movie was 1997.

[00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:12.360]
So, that's...

[00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:14.540]
Am I right about that?

[00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:16.160]
I'll tell you a little bit more.

[00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:20.340]
So, Ryan for Leap was like 22 and that movie was made.

[00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:22.600]
I'm going to tell you, he never looked better in the history of his life.

[00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:23.380]
At least I've never seen.

[00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:27.960]
He looked pristine and clean, and he was speaking like, yeah, he's supposed to be like a punk.

[00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:30.980]
Not talking like destiny, thing funny like that.

[00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:32.240]
He looked good.

[00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:34.780]
How come I never saw that before?

[00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:36.840]
I was teen screened.

[00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:37.940]
That's probably why.

[00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:38.640]
It was okay.

[00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:39.960]
I mean, it was way overdone.

[00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:42.000]
And, you know, it's just the Zygdon's egg.

[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:44.180]
But it kept you, you know.

[00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:47.060]
And then, of course, he dies toward the end.

[00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:49.460]
But then, again, so there's almost anybody else I'm not ruined in the movie for.

[00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:54.060]
Who doesn't die is a pretty famous junior who, yeah.

[00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:55.720]
And the one chick, what the hell is that?

[00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:56.260]
Who was in it?

[00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:58.240]
Jennifer Love Hewitt.

[00:13:58.360 --> 00:13:59.240]
Jennifer Love Hewitt.

[00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:00.420]
Jennifer Love Vera, Michelle Geller.

[00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:01.260]
Yeah, right.

[00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:05.580]
And the two of them were young and pristine with big, shapely, simple boobs.

[00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:08.220]
So there's something for everybody in that movie.

[00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:09.600]
I saw who you did.

[00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:10.860]
I know who you did last summer.

[00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:14.480]
Can you imagine, God, I might talk about Ryan Philly.

[00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:16.420]
He could do anybody he wanted to, basically.

[00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:17.360]
He's one of those people, you know.

[00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:19.340]
There are a few people like that.

[00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:22.880]
Not too many who could do just about anybody they wanted.

[00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:29.860]
You know, like Brady Quinn, Tom Brady, the Brady Bunch, Alice, WQA, and Hello.

[00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:31.820]
QA, and Hello.

[00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:33.720]
Hey, I saw that on your computer.

[00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:34.600]
Are you faxes?

[00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:37.520]
I had the same thing in my computer.

[00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:39.720]
I went to rjones.com.

[00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:40.900]
Yeah, yeah.

[00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:43.060]
Maybe that's where that smell is coming from.

[00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:44.960]
WQA, and Hello.

[00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:46.020]

[00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:48.320]
WQA, and Hello.

[00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:48.720]
Oh, keep going.

[00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:54.280]
QA, and Hello.

[00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:56.800]
QA, and Hello.

[00:14:57.540 --> 00:14:58.400]
WQA, and Hello.

[00:14:58.900 --> 00:14:59.180]
Okay.

[00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:00.940]
WQA, and Line 9.

[00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:01.220]
Hello.

[00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:06.180]
Oh, now this thing is acting up again.

[00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:07.520]
It's doing strange things.

[00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:08.760]
WQA, and Hello.

[00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:09.780]
Hello, and Hello.

[00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:10.340]
Yes, T.

[00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:11.540]
Yeah, I did see.

[00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:11.800]
Yeah.

[00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:14.240]
Okay, that takes care of all the calls for today.

[00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:15.660]
806 votes on the pool.

[00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:20.500]
And I noticed by the way that the crazy callers are way down the list there.

[00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:21.460]
They're not doing well at all.

[00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:22.320]
I can't imagine why.

[00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:25.340]
And by the way, thank you so much, Joyce Fitch, for your tremendous cooperation

[00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:27.780]
to help make this show what it could be, okay?

[00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:30.300]
To help make it a shadow of what it should be and could be.

[00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:34.260]
Because this is the company that refuses to cooperate.

[00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:37.580]
We always have this adversarial relationship because they just...

[00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:39.580]
It's not that they can't, but they won't.

[00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:40.680]
They won't do it.

[00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:42.780]
They won't lift up pinky finger, man.

[00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:46.200]
And by the way, we're still up, and we still only got 62 dropouts, and you're like that.

[00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:47.180]
A rad.

[00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:50.860]
So maybe since Joyce went back there and threatened the George Corsa with death.

[00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:53.240]
He threatened to bring a...

[00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:54.640]
What's his name over from the West Coast?

[00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:55.780]
Bob Vermouth.

[00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:59.900]
If you guys can't get it straight, now we'll bring a real engineer over Bob Vermouth.

[00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:01.160]
And he sure did a great job.

[00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:02.600]
You should have seen when he left an Amsterdam.

[00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:05.340]
The Dutch engineer guy thought he was going to kill himself.

[00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:07.280]
He just left.

[00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:10.280]
He just left a mess there, and as you recall, it didn't work worth a crap.

[00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:12.540]
Remember the one day I put Rimmeron trying to call me?

[00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:13.220]
Oh, yeah.

[00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:15.000]
I remember the day you tried.

[00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:18.200]
Yeah, Rimmer Underwater, which is not a bad idea.

[00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:22.780]
The main reason I listen to Neil is for laughs, 333.

[00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:25.500]

[00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:27.960]
That's why he works for a bunch of far-bison at Goiam.

[00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:34.320]
With an IQ, the size of your little digit, those bedtime stories are only 39.

[00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:37.680]
To hear him suffer 34, those crazy callers only 29.

[00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:38.940]
Why don't you hear that crap?

[00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:42.560]
Because on board 27, a break from all sports is 14.

[00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:46.640]

This is the Neil Roger Show.

[00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:52.680]

[00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:31.220]
If she had anything to do with them.

[00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:32.200]
My name is Laura.

[00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:35.740]
In my country they would go crazy.

[00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:38.220]
I'm not in the mood for these two.

[00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:39.520]

I will play the cup of kindness for all that time.

[00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:54.800]
I will take a cup of kindness for all that time.

[00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:56.440]
A tube of kindness sounds good to me.

[00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:57.740]
In fact, where can I buy one?

[00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:00.140]
I'll just smear it all over myself.

[00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:01.600]
It's a level 03 and 560.

[00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:03.300]
We're not going to drop it out no more on the street.

[00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:05.060]

That's impressive.

[00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:13.100]
Oh, I think that's because Joshua went out there and kicked him serious ass.

[00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:14.360]
He doesn't care anymore now.

[00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:16.100]
Now that he's making a big bucks.

[00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:17.180]
That's right.

[00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:19.440]
He's not holding anything back.

[00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:27.000]
He said he has never in his life imagined even dreamed in his worst nightmare working with a bigger bunch of do nothing slime balls than a QAM.

[00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:28.240]
That's what he told me before the show.

[00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:31.200]
Tigger, you know, Tigger up in Orlando.

[00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:33.140]
From Winnie the Pooh.

[00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:37.360]
The bouncy sidekick to Walt Disney World's Winnie the Pooh is in Troutwood Law again.

[00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:40.900]
That Tigger man is always in his head.

[00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:42.320]
That's why all the employees at Disney, gay.

[00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:51.880]
A Disney employee playing the fame cartoon characters under investigation after a New Hampshire family accused them of punching their 14 year old son during a home video session at Disney MGM Studios.

[00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:54.140]
You go, Tigger, I think that's a great idea.

[00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:56.600]
Somebody's wise ass punk kids man.

[00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:58.540]
Just haul off and smack him.

[00:20:59.320 --> 00:20:59.940]
That's what I should.

[00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:00.620]
That's a good idea.

[00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:00.940]
That's right.

[00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:05.240]
You know, there's nothing worse than wise acre kids.

[00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:06.080]
You know what I'm talking about?

[00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:08.000]
Do I know what you're talking about?

[00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:08.780]
Yeah, you do.

[00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:11.480]
I'm sure your kids are well behaved.

[00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:14.560]
Yeah, but it's the other people's children that really cause a problem.

[00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:14.900]
I see.

[00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:19.520]
Because your kids see it and then they wonder, you know why they're not allowed to behave that way and then you have to hit them twice as hard.

[00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:21.120]
Oh, what keep doing it?

[00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:23.480]
The Orange County Sheriff's Office is at it.

[00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:25.860]
They said it took a report from Jerry Monaco's senior.

[00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:30.640]
I wonder if he's kin to Joe Mars senior or Harold Fisher senior or Jim Merrimon senior.

[00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:34.020]
A report from Jerry Monaco or a Dany Irvine senior.

[00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:40.360]
From Jerry Monaco senior, stating that Tigger struck his son Jerry Jr. on the head about 12, 35 day afternoon.

[00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:43.240]
You go Tigger, run your side, baby.

[00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:48.060]
He felt that Tigger was essentially punched his son and he filed a police report, said, definitely Carlos Padilla.

[00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:49.780]
Or is that Padilla?

[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.240]
Remember that Jose Padilla who then be Padilla?

[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:53.000]

[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.420]
Right now the allegation is that a battery occurred.

[00:21:57.780 --> 00:22:01.180]
Of course we see a little of that family video tape when we see what appears to be a battery.

[00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:03.480]
We need to talk all sides to see exactly what happened.

[00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:05.800]
Maybe Sally Fitzloste, maybe he dropped out.

[00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:06.840]
That's a good point.

[00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:14.300]
Padilla or Padilla identified the man in the Tigger costume as Michael J. Fettelham, 31 of Kissimmee.

[00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:15.960]
Oh, what a place, Kissimmee.

[00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:19.200]
Fettelham could not be reached for comments said or evening.

[00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:22.080]
Padilla said deputies have been reached for the home and the investigation is ongoing.

[00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:24.600]
You know, I had, where the hell's that other comment?

[00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:29.180]
See you thought that once I said I put that blog up there there would be 80's in comments.

[00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:30.780]
That's what Josh told me.

[00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:33.980]
Well, you did it today, didn't you?

[00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:35.280]
You just started doing it.

[00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:35.660]
Yeah.

[00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:37.700]
Just calm down.

[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.320]
I realized the first one is my first blog entry is not all that's situlating and it's not that relevant to it.

[00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:48.740]
Like the second one is going to be about how I feel about this radio station and its management and its engineering and its sales and its schlock, whatever it is.

[00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:51.040]
Now what the hell did I do with that?

[00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:53.640]
See this is another thing that bugs it out of me.

[00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:58.940]
Let's see, I click on where it says blog up there in the, where Don Colio's head is.

[00:22:59.040 --> 00:22:59.540]
There we go.

[00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:02.540]
It says you have no subscriptions.

[00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:04.240]
I still don't understand what the hell that means.

[00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:07.140]
But anyway, where's the comments? Where's the fourth one?

[00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:08.200]
Here we go.

[00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:14.700]
From Strangelove in Hollywood, who from a distance looks really interesting within his post-up pictures on his page.

[00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:15.880]
Don't look all that interesting.

[00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:18.580]
Maybe that's why he goes home alone every night.

[00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:19.240]
He said, well, whatever.

[00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:20.880]
He's a good guy. Strangelove.

[00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:24.340]
He said, someone once used my picture and pretended to be someone else.

[00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:27.040]
I'll never understand the life of me why they did that.

[00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:30.420]
Are people so miserable with themselves that they have to pretend that they're somebody else?

[00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:31.760]
Yes, absolutely.

[00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:32.440]
Yeah, yeah.

[00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:38.580]
It's the internet and now that we got this my space and your face and all this other crap.

[00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:41.100]
It's a place for people who want to play games.

[00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:47.400]
You know, it's for people who got too much time on their head, played little games like little babies, like infants, like little children.

[00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:53.300]
And just like I said, if somebody doesn't want to tell me where the hell they live, forget about even the city.

[00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:54.440]
Just the county they're in.

[00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:57.260]
I don't want to be involved with somebody like that.

[00:23:57.360 --> 00:23:58.600]
What's with all the secrets, huh?

[00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:00.500]
What's with all the freaking secrets?

[00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:01.900]
Who are you people hiding from?

[00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:06.080]
Probably they're in the damn federal witness protection program.

[00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:07.980]
That could be.

[00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:09.480]
Friday's incident.

[00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:10.920]
I bet you that's where Jacob is.

[00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:11.500]
He's vanished.

[00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:13.140]
He's in the witness protection program.

[00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:14.140]
Hey, Jacob.

[00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:27.980]
Friday's incident is the second nearly three years involving Tigard costume Disney workers in February 2004, a 13-year-old girl and her mother reported being groped and molested by somebody dressed as Tigard Magic Kingdoms Tune Town.

[00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:33.000]
Oh, I've got a great line for that, but you're not going to use it and you know what it is.

[00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:33.460]
Oh.

[00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:40.700]
Sheriff's official surrested Michael Shartran 38, but a jury later acquitted him and he was reinstated as a Disney employee.

[00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:45.520]
In that case, the girl and her mother reported Tigard groped their breasts during a photo session.

[00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:46.520]
You go, Tigard.

[00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:48.400]
When in doubt, pop them out.

[00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:53.580]
Padea said Friday's confrontation was taped by Jerry Monaco, senior actor reviewing the footage with his family.

[00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:55.020]
They decided to come forward.

[00:24:55.840 --> 00:25:01.620]
Disney official said federalins have been suspended and until an internal investigation in the Sheriff's criminal inquiry are completed.

[00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:07.260]
We received a complaint that a character allegedly struck a guest at Zeroyas Suarez, a Disney spokeswoman,

[00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:11.100]
and actually a physical altercation between characters and guests is not tolerated.

[00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:18.300]
The Monaco's home video shot by Jerry Senior shows a towering Tigard staring next to Jerry Monastani next to Jerry Monaco,

[00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:21.840]
Jr., while his mother and two brothers, Neil are standing in front of the costume character.

[00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:28.380]
In a series of seconds, Tigard grabs and locks Jerry Jr.'s left arm with his right arm and then throws a left jab at the teenager's face.

[00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:31.220]
Maybe the kid farted at him or something like that.

[00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:34.060]
Or the kid said something to him like, you're fair.

[00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:35.680]
Which probably is true because he works at Disney.

[00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:41.820]
The Monaco couldn't be reached for comment Saturday at the Greenville, New Hampshire home, but the father and son told TV reporters,

[00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:43.860]
Tigard threw a punch without provocation.

[00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:48.940]
At first I thought he was just kidding around and playing around them when he actually grabbed my arm, Jerry Jr.'s said.

[00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:52.940]
His father said their Disney vacation was marred, did it?

[00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:56.140]
You don't come here for this. I mean Disney is supposed to be a safe place.

[00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.320]
It's supposed to be a place that you come and enjoy with your family.

[00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:02.420]
At first I was upset with my son. He said I thought he did something at Tigard.

[00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:04.420]
He probably needed him in the nuts or something like that.

[00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:08.840]
But then I reviewed the tape and it's pretty clear for just no reason he clocked him in the face.

[00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:10.860]
How do you like that? He clocked him in the face.

[00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:14.520]
That damn Tigard.

[00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:17.480]
Yeah, the wonderful thing about Tigard and Tigard is a wonderful thing.

[00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:19.660]
The top's made it a rubber.

[00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:22.820]
852 votes on the pool.

[00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:26.100]
I think we'll make our thousand of the inspeitedly late night and the lights start last night.

[00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:30.340]
And 13 people hate me. I should have put a hate to you like poison.

[00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:34.940]
I like that. Hey, how do you spell that?

[00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:39.800]
Just like that.

[00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:44.960]
5670560, pound 560 in the Verizon Singular Wireless Line.

[00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:47.900]
Boy, I'm telling you this. We are calm down now on our streaming.

[00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:50.560]
We apologize to those people who are maybe listening online right now.

[00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:55.740]
And congratulations on your perspacacious, on your perseverance.

[00:26:58.460 --> 00:27:01.440]
You ought to see all the zillions of people we have listening online.

[00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:04.480]
And you know what the reason is? It's a bogus number because they listen for two minutes.

[00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:06.160]
And they get knocked off and they log on again.

[00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:08.540]
So it looks like we got a zillion people listening online today.

[00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:12.500]
And up until this hour, last few minutes, we don't have anybody listening online.

[00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:15.580]
Because once again, here we am, can't get it done.

[00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:18.960]
I'm sure that once Josh is full time over there on a QN.com.

[00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:20.420]
You're never going to have problems like this.

[00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:22.240]
Oh, yeah.

[00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:24.940]
You're not eating, are you now?

[00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:27.540]
There's a lot of big meal here on the show.

[00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:31.660]
This is your last supper?

[00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:32.580]
That's right.

[00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:33.720]
Wow.

[00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:38.280]
This may, and the fact that they won't even tell you whether it is or if it isn't.

[00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:40.500]
I mean, you know, is that a difficult question?

[00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:42.320]
Well, they decided that it is.

[00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:44.740]
Josh and Chris decided that it would be.

[00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:45.680]
I see.

[00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:49.980]
It's like my confabulating with somebody online and asking like,

[00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:51.120]
what county do you live in?

[00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:53.480]
Is it brown or is it, and like no response?

[00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:56.560]
And I'm thinking, is that a difficult question?

[00:27:57.240 --> 00:27:57.360]
Huh?

[00:27:58.080 --> 00:27:58.580]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:03.960]
Too much freaking mystery with you online game players, baby.

[00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:06.900]
Too much mystery and intrigue.

[00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:09.240]
Look at that. The sun just poked through the fog here, man.

[00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:10.880]
Although it's going to start.

[00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:11.300]
We're going to start.

[00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:13.980]
I hit the break the news to all my fellow Torontonians,

[00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:14.900]
but little winners coming.

[00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:16.440]
WDQA and hello.

[00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:17.800]
I'm still playing.

[00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:19.480]
WDQA and hello.

[00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:22.340]
Neil, I've been a fan for over 12 years.

[00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:24.180]
Now, I guess what we still hate you like poison.

[00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:25.900]
Chronic.

[00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:29.140]
Quick drink in that chronic tonic.

[00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:31.680]
Race is, have you seen the Tigger video?

[00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:34.340]
No, this is Ray University Dodge, who's really chronic.

[00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:36.040]
Almost as chronic as the one we just had on the phone.

[00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:38.580]
The one that should be punched is the father from milking this.

[00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:41.180]
They were posing for a picture and little horse playing suit.

[00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:44.060]
Nobody was punched, but the greedy father should be.

[00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:45.120]
Check out the video since Ray.

[00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:47.540]
So you just horse it around and right away they want to make something.

[00:28:47.540 --> 00:28:49.840]
Make a big simist to try to get a few bucks out of Disney.

[00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:51.380]
That's probably what it's all about.

[00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:53.440]
Okay, thanks Ray and get a life by the way.

[00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:53.720]
Ray.

[00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:54.480]
I have no life.

[00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:56.280]
WDQA and hello.

[00:28:57.560 --> 00:28:57.960]
Hello.

[00:28:58.460 --> 00:28:58.760]
Yes sir.

[00:28:59.740 --> 00:29:00.700]
Yes, is this QIM?

[00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:01.880]
Yes it is.

[00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:08.220]
I want Neil to play a continuous loop of Nick Savon, say he's not going out.

[00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:09.760]
Yeah, we don't care about Nick Savon, go away.

[00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:13.560]
Oh, oh, oh.

[00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:15.480]
And get to it snappy, would you?

[00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:17.860]
Yeah, WDQA and hello.

[00:29:22.780 --> 00:29:25.600]
5608, 5608, 5608, 5608, the Verizon singular wireless line.

[00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:27.680]
We're going to take about a big pile of stuff here.

[00:29:27.780 --> 00:29:28.020]
You know what?

[00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:29.240]
I don't think I'm going to read any of it.

[00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:32.980]
I just don't have the enthusiasm to do it.

[00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:35.480]
I've had my kishkis have been worn out that first hour today.

[00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:37.860]
That was like doing a 60 hour marathon at first hour.

[00:29:40.180 --> 00:29:41.980]
But we are often streaming now.

[00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:44.960]
We had only 62 dropouts in the first hour.

[00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:48.200]
I'm going to tell you, dropout is the word.

[00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:53.240]
If you want to know about our management middle level, upper middle, you want to know about the beastly, dropout is the word.

[00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:58.260]
As in that dropout from school, I'm talking about dropout from the human race like that.

[00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:02.480]
Or maybe drop out of the tree in between streaming on the banjo and picking you nose.

[00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:05.760]
Now what that was I supposed to play?

[00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:06.960]
Oh, the girl with the infosima.

[00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:07.940]
Excuse me, I'll get to it.

[00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:08.920]
Yeah.

[00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:10.760]
1113.

[00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:12.200]
That's another one, Gary Sarner.

[00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:13.160]
There's another genius.

[00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:16.360]
Yeah, you're doing it, baby.

[00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:17.540]
Let me tell you.

[00:30:17.540 --> 00:30:18.660]
Oh, yeah, I'm taking a day.

[00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:20.820]
A day, a day.

[00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:25.800]
Oh, baby, I can't get me in a day.

[00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:28.940]
Oh, that's why I'm supposed to play another one, sorry.

[00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:31.180]
The girl he's gonna do at home?

[00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:32.380]
Yeah.

[00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:35.560]
While I forgot all about it cuz my old timer is this kicking in.

[00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:36.820]
Here it is.

[00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:41.780]
Then gets in the Astrid Gilbertal Astrid Gilbertal

[00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:52.220]
The girl with empathy might keep smoking and when she passes she flips her ashes

[00:30:52.900 --> 00:31:03.440]
When she smokes she's like the chimney that shoots up clouds on smiths on her stick

[00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:07.680]
That when she passes she passes gas and goes

[00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:15.840]
Oh but she wants to quit badly

[00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:24.920]
Capping up big junky lungers

[00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:30.440]
Yes she would keep them up gladly

[00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:35.660]
But it's there when she has to go pee

[00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:39.860]
She sits on the can and likes to pee

[00:31:39.860 --> 00:31:43.700]
Shocked and felled in and sickly

[00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:52.980]
The girl with empathy might go smoking and when she passes she smiles with big yellow teeth

[00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:14.300]
Oh but she's smoking

[00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:21.780]
Oh but she's smoking

[00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:28.740]
Oh but she's smoking

[00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:29.180]
Oh but she wants to quit badly

[00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:34.340]
But it's there when she has to go pee

[00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:38.620]
She sits on the can and likes to pee

[00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:42.560]
Shocked and felled in and sickly

[00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:52.240]
The girl with empathy might go smoking and then she flashes that smile with big yellow teeth

[00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:55.200]
And gunk on the meat

[00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:58.300]
She just cannot breathe

[00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:02.740]
It's only a least

[00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:10.080]
Can I have a light please?

[00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:12.360]
No

[00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:16.360]
Honey passed 11 at 5.60 Q.M.

[00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:18.040]
So Russell fasses and sails

[00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:22.220]
The New York City natural gas smell is coming from the massive oil refineries in North Jersey

[00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:23.820]
Which always smell like rotten eggs

[00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:24.980]
Ever grabbed the Jersey trip?

[00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:26.820]
Yes I have us and Jersey stinks

[00:33:26.820 --> 00:33:28.700]
It smells it reeks

[00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:33.380]
Lights out for us when the area for the past few days is carried the pollution of the streets of Manhattan

[00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:35.640]
No big deal, no big simmous

[00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:38.100]
And here's one somebody fashed in for the pool

[00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:40.120]
I listen to you because he speaks the truth

[00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:43.600]
Right, put that on here he speaks the truth

[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:48.640]
They can't handle the truth but I speak the truth as ugly and nasty as it is

[00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:52.620]
To our management to a South Florida Chamber of Commerce I tell you the way it is

[00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:56.140]
It's not always a pleasant thing the truth a lot of people would rather hear BS

[00:33:57.120 --> 00:33:57.520]
Sure

[00:33:58.100 --> 00:34:01.480]
That's why a lot of people would rather just like fun and games

[00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:02.580]
Fun and games

[00:34:02.580 --> 00:34:03.960]
Fun and games

[00:34:05.340 --> 00:34:06.220]
So where do you live?

[00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:08.780]
Oh I'm an Antarctica, I'm on Uranus

[00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:09.900]
I'm in Pudol

[00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:11.720]
I'm a Tigger of the Atagre

[00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:15.960]
800-E-9 votes in the pool, we're at the thousand like what were you worried about for Christ's sake

[00:34:18.420 --> 00:34:21.860]
965 friends in my space, now don't forget our goal by the end of January to get to a thousand

[00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:23.100]
I think we can do that now

[00:34:23.100 --> 00:34:26.480]
I don't know why that's our goal, I just made it up

[00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:28.160]
It's fun having a goal in life

[00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:32.420]
Like you said when you hear the sound from city Paulson in the morning you know I reach my goal

[00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:33.500]
I got up again the next day

[00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:33.920]
That's right

[00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:35.320]
Why do you say that?

[00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:36.460]
It's been a warm and fuzzy

[00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:38.660]
You make me feel like I'm on a virgin death or something

[00:34:38.660 --> 00:34:41.840]
I guess that by self-order standards I'm still a teenager for Christ's sake

[00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:42.400]
Oh that's true

[00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:43.900]
64 is old

[00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:47.860]

Yes

[00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:15.200]
The problem with being honest speaking of truth is you'd be called crazy

[00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:16.920]
Yeah

[00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:17.720]
Right

[00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:18.360]
Right

[00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:21.120]
Well what does that mean?

[00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:23.580]
Well look at you for instance

[00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:26.280]
Look at me what?

[00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:28.280]
Yeah okay

[00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:30.260]
That was really good

[00:35:30.260 --> 00:35:31.440]
It had a lot of good material there man

[00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:32.840]
Look at you for instance, huh?

[00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:33.500]
Crazy

[00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:34.640]
Crazy is a bed bug

[00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:37.080]
That's why twice a month when I put that deposit in the bank

[00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:39.000]
Crazy, crazy like a fox

[00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:41.700]
Crazy, slipper

[00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:43.600]

Look at that, he speaks the truth has already got a pair

[00:35:48.820 --> 00:35:52.100]
That's what the last guy said for those who are not trying to interpret what he was talking about

[00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:54.140]
Just like that no material

[00:35:54.620 --> 00:35:56.400]
Why shouldn't he be different from anybody else

[00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:56.780]
Right

[00:35:56.780 --> 00:35:58.300]

So we'll see you Josh

[00:36:20.740 --> 00:36:22.200]

[00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:22.680]

I think I'm gonna be in the pool pen

[00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:27.940]
But here's the funniest thing

[00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:29.100]
We don't know

[00:36:29.540 --> 00:36:30.200]
Oh I see

[00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:30.960]

There are a lot of

[00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:36.820]
Just the common answer

[00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:38.580]
Hey don't need to be asking the other question down

[00:36:38.580 --> 00:36:40.960]

[00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:55.880]
A little keychain that I think that you'll find

[00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:58.780]
A little unique picture of Ryan Philippe

[00:36:58.780 --> 00:36:59.440]
Philippe

[00:36:59.440 --> 00:36:59.800]
No

[00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:02.440]
I'd sure like to have that

[00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:05.220]
And then something else that a listener sent in but I forget what it was

[00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:06.180]
Another movie or something

[00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:08.680]

[00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:13.860]
Government contractors

[00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:34.920]
A federal bankruptcy court in New York rule Thursday

[00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:38.360]
The case could proceed despite the fact that they're America's file from Chantra Love and Bank of America

[00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:43.780]
Under federal law legal proceedings against the company are frozen when the company declares bankruptcy

[00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:50.740]
CACI, international, asked the bankruptcy court in November to allow its case to go forward arguing that it claims against

Scare America are covered by insurance policy

[00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:55.840]
Any damages will be paid out of that policy and not from the company's assets

[00:37:57.040 --> 00:38:03.920]
The company sued our American its parent company Picon LLC as well as Rhodes in the fall of 2005 for defamation

[00:38:04.460 --> 00:38:08.660]
The suit stem from comments he made August 25th and 6th 2005 on a video show

[00:38:08.660 --> 00:38:18.920]
According to the complaint she accused CACI employees of raping and murdering Iraqis of Indians at Abu Gharr prison claims that the CACI said were false and defamatory

[00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:23.620]
They're seeking a million dollars in compensatory damages and 10 million impudentive damages

[00:38:23.620 --> 00:38:28.100]
And Air America is spokeswoman to climb the coming of the lawsuit. They got problems made at Scare America

[00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:35.740]
US District Court dismissed the case but CACI appealed that ruling the bankruptcy court decision laws that appealed it proceed

[00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:42.200]
Air America declared bankruptcy October 13 but a company spokeswoman said last month it was supposed to reach a deal with a via

[00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:50.060]
Arlington Virginia based CACI is an information technology consulting firm against most of its revenue from government contracts

A subsidiary company provided it's a written interrogators for the US military and Iraq the company acknowledges from place

[00:38:55.180 --> 00:38:57.980]

Coming up tonight inside the behind the true Hollywood celebrity music biography profile story

[00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:51.400]
They topped the charts with an upbeat little number about a very particular sexual fantasy

[00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:57.700]
They didn't even give a crap that it was scientifically impossible they were the weather girls

[00:39:57.700 --> 00:40:06.160]
It's raining but I don't know if it's raining but song is an abomination against God

[00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:14.060]
Reverend Peter vent is a fire and grinched old preacher who believes the weather girls 1980s hit is an abomination against God

[00:40:14.060 --> 00:40:22.260]
I just said that sorry for God has sent many plays rain and from the sky blood fire even frogs

[00:40:22.260 --> 00:40:30.400]
But for the sky to deposit men into the waiting hungry sweaty loins of moistened harlots is nothing but an abomination against God

[00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:39.340]
Testify a brother now I tell you if and I mean if the all powerful did decide to rain men upon this earth

[00:40:39.340 --> 00:40:47.700]
It would not be a simple festival of lust no it would actually be very dangerous it would go something like this

[00:40:47.700 --> 00:41:00.620]
The horror the horror and the weirdest thing brothers and sisters is that somehow this blasphemous old to promiscuity

[00:41:00.620 --> 00:41:12.140]
Very quickly became an anthem for the homosexual may I quote Corinthian 613 for the prophet did say the gays like this thing go figure

[00:41:12.140 --> 00:41:22.320]

924 votes in a pool so I'm going to have a couple of weenies right here on the year during the show wow with my French is a yellow monster

[00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:26.520]
Yeah the flavor wave is great I use it almost every single day now what company did you get that front remember that one guy who was it

[00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:30.180]
Yeah I haven't never sprained down that one day like they're writing a book everybody's writing a book

[00:43:30.180 --> 00:43:39.180]
That would be a good book yeah the good book says 5 6 7 0 5 60 fact I may go out and get to it when you hear that beep beep you know how

[00:43:39.180 --> 00:43:45.460]
when the flavor wave is done cooking and the thing about the flavor wave is even when the cooking time is done yeah it goes like

[00:43:46.620 --> 00:43:52.220]
when the cook time is done it's still the elements still stays on it comes on every now and so it keeps the food warm on right

[00:43:53.740 --> 00:44:04.280]
It is a fine machine mine WQ I am hello WQ I am hello Q I M

[00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:13.640]
Hello yes sir yeah no which one was that the same one

[00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:20.960]
Wow could have fooled me but what are we at what Chris yeah Chris actually fades in faster and you do remember when you were on vacation that week

[00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:28.480]
and Tahoe oh yeah they get like about a half a half a word out it's like they just disappear while we'll have to make in the new board

[00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:37.380]
off of the show then won't we I'm going to go get my weenies you like it

[00:44:39.560 --> 00:44:45.180]
and off he goes so when we last left this conversation you didn't know what office you were going to be operating out of

[00:44:45.180 --> 00:44:50.780]
I think I put you in the bullpen they've already got like bunk desks in there I'm thinking maybe they're going to give me like a mini desk

[00:44:52.000 --> 00:45:00.660]
and I'll be up against the wall I see you know you could always use the other side of Allison's desk because I mean she didn't think it could get any worse

[00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:08.580]
that's what we're looking at guess what what's that two people per desk in the bullpen oh yeah you're going to be sitting in somebody's lap in there

[00:45:08.580 --> 00:45:18.960]
double duty you're going to be sitting in Allison's lap yeah my mouse to it here can you hear it I can hear it clinking around

[00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:34.340]
now do you fear or do you dip I swear it all over the way in her man there we go and then I take my knife and I like even it out you know what I mean

[00:45:34.340 --> 00:45:42.480]
absolutely so it's like nice and there were no clumping and you don't want to a big mustard deposit you know the good thing about the flavor

[00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:54.320]
right and when you close something even like this yeah it's like it was cruffed in the grill yeah and the other good thing is that you know since it's clear and all lit up

[00:45:54.320 --> 00:46:03.980]
and you can see how far along your food is coming it's nice and because some people that are very paranoid about raw chicken like some of us who got served raw chicken a lot as a kid

[00:46:03.980 --> 00:46:20.980]
thanks mom can can satisfy themselves that it's nice and burnt before they get into it well I'll be damned so this is our farewell lunch with Josh quarters we think sure thanks how we may he may or may not have a place to sit when he moves over to qm.com

[00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:26.740]
he might just have to move over to the other side of the little card table that we have over here on the side at least we have a

[00:46:27.100 --> 00:46:40.740]
little card table for a place to squeeze in and it's what it looks like so far and if Chris isn't one of those five things I want to all the free food you can come in and have your free food every day is to him I probably still will be and we got you

[00:46:40.740 --> 00:46:54.000]
to explore we got to train really well I watch the story I guess my dog is a cafe of wine huh yeah see now this feels more like at home you know

[00:46:54.000 --> 00:47:07.140]
you know you should hear me eat on the ear right I haven't been doing that 189 by the way the scariest morning not too bad that's good that's not great but I mean I just can't

[00:47:07.140 --> 00:47:20.280]
break through that level I don't know what it is maybe there's a few I'm sure way yeah yeah that wasn't me what was that

reason main reason I was in the 1131 votes we got the thousand licked easy man you are such a

[00:47:39.720 --> 00:47:47.080]
negative a little you know why just because just guys Joe Bell called you on Friday and live to you no actually he repeated

[01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:30.420]
I'm gonna deliberate all during now what were you saying you were supposed to deliberate in

[01:00:30.420 --> 01:00:33.700]
the last break whether I would respond to a you know who and you know who you know I mean

[01:00:33.700 --> 01:00:40.700]
oh yeah yeah and the answer about it same first of all neither one of those people is

[01:00:40.700 --> 01:00:44.980]
going to do that you do understand I do understand that because the whole concept with this thing is

[01:00:44.980 --> 01:00:50.400]
once you shut somebody out it's you've got the power it's the frustration factor you can't get

[01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:55.780]
through to me I'm gonna change my number I'm gonna change my shoe size I'm gonna change my capsize

[01:00:55.780 --> 01:01:02.220]
I'm even gonna change my size how do you like that this is pretty quick whenever I shave my balls

[01:01:02.220 --> 01:01:04.780]
I listen to the Neil Rogers 12-1 hour

[01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:21.140]
then he had a slow-down call at the society ball through testreet car one way with the girl

[01:01:21.140 --> 01:01:28.540]
from King Kong thingy she brought that the door she was looking for only made a dime a day

[01:01:28.540 --> 01:01:35.560]
she says was made in my mowage she was gonna be enough to just like Vivian Lee did on

[01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:44.240]
her plantation and draw the model too she thought that alcohol was the enemy but she knows that

[01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:50.860]
nothing nothing nothing nothing nothing all right it's out soulsin and chaplain waiting for

[01:01:51.620 --> 01:01:53.720]
more

[01:02:10.260 --> 01:02:17.680]
housing

[01:02:20.980 --> 01:02:23.420]
The wind's freaking on Nicky Finn

[01:02:23.420 --> 01:02:25.380]
She did the jarl stun

[01:02:26.140 --> 01:02:27.420]
To do galling, can

[01:02:27.420 --> 01:02:29.280]
For her her mind would will

[01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:31.520]
When she crept of molten burl

[01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:33.280]
She wore it out bit

[01:02:33.980 --> 01:02:35.000]
Like a rapper

[01:02:35.860 --> 01:02:37.120]
Cause I've no admission

[01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:38.860]
She could have no maker

[01:02:39.580 --> 01:02:41.020]
She robbed the comedy show

[01:02:41.540 --> 01:02:42.860]
Like Jojen Ways to

[01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:45.480]
But never happened to Abby

[01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:46.580]
She was on second

[01:02:47.340 --> 01:02:48.240]
I don't know if I'm sorry

[01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:50.440]
She was a filthin' and chaplain

[01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:52.300]
Waiting for gay couples

[01:02:52.300 --> 01:02:54.420]
And Charles Limber to do that

[01:02:54.420 --> 01:02:56.500]
The president was Hoover

[01:02:56.500 --> 01:02:58.240]
There was no TV

[01:02:58.240 --> 01:03:00.260]
And no I love the scene

[01:03:00.260 --> 01:03:02.660]
Also free actin' high

[01:03:02.660 --> 01:03:06.380]
1990, 1990, 1925

[01:03:06.380 --> 01:03:08.100]
Woo-hoo!

[01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:11.900]
Woo-hoo!

[01:03:11.900 --> 01:03:12.900]
Woo-hoo!

[01:03:16.180 --> 01:03:17.380]
Woo-hoo!

[01:03:17.380 --> 01:03:17.800]
Woo-hoo!

[01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:17.800]

[01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:17.800]

[01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:19.360]
We're about 10 years too late

[01:03:19.900 --> 01:03:21.480]
Yep, that's when things were great

[01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:23.140]
When thing was president

[01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:25.280]
O.J. was innocent

[01:03:25.900 --> 01:03:27.440]
But we could still see friends

[01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:29.500]
And few percent blood dead

[01:03:29.500 --> 01:03:31.140]
Barely added internet

[01:03:31.900 --> 01:03:33.500]
And there was no spaniards

[01:03:33.500 --> 01:03:35.380]
Never heard about bin Laden

[01:03:35.900 --> 01:03:37.280]
Wall Street was always in the black

[01:03:37.900 --> 01:03:39.320]
We still care about my gun

[01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:41.320]
And not about sneak attacks

[01:03:41.320 --> 01:03:43.200]
And all that great music

[01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:45.500]
Yeah, you could take your big

[01:03:45.500 --> 01:03:47.220]
Like it was sent from God

[01:03:47.220 --> 01:03:49.100]
No cell phones, no things don't

[01:03:49.100 --> 01:03:50.780]
No, I'd pause

[01:03:50.780 --> 01:03:53.000]
Play no racist or hoody

[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.020]
That brandy was a cutie

[01:03:55.020 --> 01:03:57.060]
There was a land that's more sex

[01:03:57.060 --> 01:03:58.900]
And Julius Blip from love

[01:03:58.900 --> 01:04:00.900]
And the fulcans were smashing

[01:04:00.900 --> 01:04:03.140]
The Beatles tried to dash in

[01:04:03.140 --> 01:04:05.460]
But something white feels right since

[01:04:05.460 --> 01:04:09.300]
1919, 1990, but

[01:04:09.300 --> 01:04:10.360]
Woo-hoo!

[01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:13.280]
1990, but

[01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:14.320]
Woo-hoo!

[01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:17.880]
You know Mariah

[01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:18.940]
And Whitney

[01:04:19.460 --> 01:04:20.880]
They beat the pants on Britney

[01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:23.060]
We still had some teasers

[01:04:23.060 --> 01:04:26.100]
But also there was Wizard and We had so feet

[01:04:26.100 --> 01:04:27.100]
We hogged in

[01:04:27.100 --> 01:04:28.980]
Yeah, she was good for dogging

[01:04:28.980 --> 01:04:31.480]
I wondered if she's through my bath

[01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:35.140]
19, 1995

[01:04:35.140 --> 01:04:36.480]
Woo-hoo!

[01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:40.480]
Woo-hoo!

[01:04:46.820 --> 01:04:48.080]
2004's your sucks

[01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:50.000]
Next year we'll have more luck

[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.120]
I can see it now

[01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:54.140]
I bet they'll cure Matt Gow

[01:04:54.140 --> 01:04:56.120]
Might even fight a cure

[01:04:56.120 --> 01:04:58.060]
For that guy Michael Moore

[01:04:58.060 --> 01:04:59.800]
When you feel you're SUV

[01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:02.000]
That gas will all be free

[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.140]
Even when we're stuck to our taxes

[01:05:04.140 --> 01:05:06.200]
Depends it's will still go down

[01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:08.120]
And rather we'll not use taxes

[01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:10.080]
Osama will be found

[01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:11.800]
I know it will be peace

[01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:14.200]
Throughout the Middle East

[01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:15.760]
All kids will graduate

[01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:17.780]
And clear eyes will be

[01:05:17.780 --> 01:05:21.720]
So straight please let it be great year

[01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:23.640]
I sure hated this year

[01:05:23.640 --> 01:05:25.580]
Don't eat War's art, elections

[01:05:25.580 --> 01:05:27.520]
And no more blue infections

[01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:28.700]
And C.E. will be

[01:05:29.340 --> 01:05:30.720]
Cleaners and start jumps

[01:05:30.720 --> 01:05:31.640]
We'll be leaners

[01:05:31.640 --> 01:05:32.700]
Let's all look down

[01:05:32.700 --> 01:05:34.220]
The bright side is

[01:05:35.240 --> 01:05:37.960]
2000, 2000, 2005

[01:05:38.540 --> 01:05:40.120]
Okay, it is a 1205

[01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:41.760]
Oh, I thought this story wasn't going to print out

[01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:42.580]
But now it's printing out

[01:05:42.580 --> 01:05:43.240]
Excellent

[01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:44.520]
A little bit on the slow side

[01:05:44.520 --> 01:05:45.780]
That's probably because it's from the Herald

[01:05:47.980 --> 01:05:49.900]
Here's some videos for all you drug drivers

[01:05:49.900 --> 01:05:52.620]
Wait a minute, where the hell is the story

[01:05:52.620 --> 01:05:54.320]
Here's a blank page, says Miami Herald

[01:05:55.320 --> 01:05:56.620]
Here it is

[01:05:57.260 --> 01:05:59.940]
About 300 drug driving cases in Broward County

[01:05:59.940 --> 01:06:03.040]
Could be thrown out following a state of political

[01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:06.260]
Arrolling in proper maintenance of the alcohol breath test machines

[01:06:06.260 --> 01:06:07.940]
Renders the results

[01:06:08.620 --> 01:06:08.940]
Inadmissible

[01:06:10.420 --> 01:06:12.620]
The fourth district court of appeal upheld the judges

[01:06:12.620 --> 01:06:15.640]
Really tossed out and toxilized the results in a DUI case

[01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:18.320]
Because the machine had been tested with tap water

[01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:20.000]
Instead of distilled water

[01:06:20.940 --> 01:06:25.280]
The FDA requires that the breath test machines use the still water

[01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:28.320]
The fence of attorneys argue that tap water may skew the results

[01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:33.540]
But the both the Groud Sheriff's Office and the Navy police department used tap water to test their machines

[01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:36.780]
So if you had a DUI, it kind of like

[01:06:36.780 --> 01:06:39.760]
Turned your life upside down for a while, too bad your sprues

[01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:41.880]
Unless you're one of the current 300 pending ones

[01:06:42.920 --> 01:06:43.840]
How do you like that?

[01:06:44.380 --> 01:06:45.520]
Well, what do you know

[01:06:46.760 --> 01:06:47.340]
I'm sorry

[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:51.960]
So anyway, mission to Mars, that's a Gerolitos group and I'm not going to read this whole thing

[01:06:51.960 --> 01:06:52.700]
Thank you very much.

[01:06:53.060 --> 01:06:53.840]
30 seconds to Mars

[01:06:54.620 --> 01:06:55.680]
30 seconds, why?

[01:06:56.040 --> 01:06:56.960]
That's the name of the group.

[01:06:57.260 --> 01:06:58.000]
What do I call it?

[01:06:58.160 --> 01:06:58.680]
Mission to Mars.

[01:06:59.840 --> 01:07:00.480]
That's okay.

[01:07:06.660 --> 01:07:08.200]
Do you like it?

[01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:13.840]
Well, the headline on a story says mission to Mars

[01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:14.780]
Okay, I understand.

[01:07:14.780 --> 01:07:17.300]
And my being a little bit off my feet today

[01:07:17.300 --> 01:07:19.860]
My eyes were wandering, my mind was wandering

[01:07:19.860 --> 01:07:20.500]
I understand.

[01:07:20.540 --> 01:07:22.200]
You should see up the date about Jared, you know

[01:07:23.460 --> 01:07:25.900]
Well, you were telling me that he's given up the music

[01:07:26.380 --> 01:07:27.680]
That's what the story says

[01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:29.060]
Is that what this story says?

[01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:30.780]
I don't think it's a word for her because it's too long

[01:07:30.780 --> 01:07:32.520]
Thanks Tracy, but enough already with that

[01:07:32.520 --> 01:07:35.420]
Plus he's about 35, 36, and he's going to be an old man

[01:07:35.420 --> 01:07:36.260]
Too late for me.

[01:07:43.420 --> 01:07:43.780]
Geezer.

[01:07:43.780 --> 01:07:46.020]
And I hate Neil, I hate this fool, I got 15 apiece

[01:07:46.020 --> 01:07:47.740]
Well, guess what? I hate those 15 too

[01:07:47.740 --> 01:07:49.260]
I do like that like poison

[01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:52.180]
WDQYM, hello

[01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:54.040]
Hello, Mr. Neil

[01:07:54.860 --> 01:07:56.120]
Yes, could you play

[01:07:56.980 --> 01:07:58.580]
What is that? Could you play?

[01:07:58.700 --> 01:07:59.140]
What is that?

[01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:00.940]
In other words, you have nothing to say, this is a request?

[01:08:01.320 --> 01:08:04.040]
No, no, well, it's one that you haven't played in a while

[01:08:04.040 --> 01:08:08.180]
And since you're playing the fart sounds again, I figure you can play this bit again

[01:08:08.180 --> 01:08:09.860]
Who says we're playing fart sounds again?

[01:08:09.980 --> 01:08:10.940]
Are you hallucinating again?

[01:08:10.940 --> 01:08:12.660]
The raspberry's in there

[01:08:12.660 --> 01:08:14.900]
Yeah, what is it?

[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:15.740]
My anus?

[01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:19.480]
Yeah, your anus is exactly right, that's just what I was thinking when I heard your voice

[01:08:19.480 --> 01:08:21.060]
I thought my aching angel

[01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:22.440]
God

[01:08:23.900 --> 01:08:24.260]
Wow

[01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:29.220]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, and pound 5, 60, and the other rising and singular rising

[01:08:29.220 --> 01:08:30.340]
So maybe I will play that

[01:08:31.100 --> 01:08:32.240]
What's wrong with that?

[01:08:32.860 --> 01:08:35.060]
I don't know. Nothing wrong with it. I don't think so

[01:08:35.060 --> 01:08:37.940]
No, nothing wrong with a Joycemind having a resident. Too bad Joyce.

[01:08:37.940 --> 01:08:43.480]
Joyce doesn't run this show. She does nothing for this show except in her fear and tried to do everything in her power

[01:08:43.480 --> 01:08:47.900]
And my earthwhile attorney, he's sitting back there with his finger deep inside his thumb

[01:08:47.900 --> 01:08:48.700]
Some young guys

[01:08:51.180 --> 01:08:56.700]
I'm going to tell you something normal. You ought to be raising a holy hell, writing a letter, making a phone call

[01:08:56.700 --> 01:09:00.560]
That's not going to get the job done. These people need to be brought to justice

[01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:03.680]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:04.740]
I know what you're saying

[01:09:04.740 --> 01:09:07.660]
And for justice, we better get a hold of Don Coyote

[01:09:07.660 --> 01:09:12.800]
That's right, or somebody. The guy that ran our MySpace page looks like Don Coyote unto me

[01:09:15.100 --> 01:09:15.880]
WQA and Hello

[01:09:16.780 --> 01:09:18.200]
Hi, I'm a Kira Tommy

[01:09:18.900 --> 01:09:19.680]
WQA and Hello

[01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:20.980]
I like Project 3

[01:09:20.980 --> 01:09:21.560]
QA and

[01:09:23.460 --> 01:09:23.900]
Hello

[01:09:23.900 --> 01:09:25.520]
Hey, how are you?

[01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:30.520]
I was hearing you went to Mohican Sun the other day

[01:09:30.520 --> 01:09:31.660]
I went to what?

[01:09:32.340 --> 01:09:34.000]
Mohican Sun the casino

[01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:36.540]
What are you talking about?

[01:09:37.060 --> 01:09:38.160]
What are you talking about?

[01:09:38.420 --> 01:09:40.880]
I want to know the name of the casino you go to

[01:09:45.780 --> 01:09:46.580]
WQA and Hello

[01:09:49.580 --> 01:09:50.240]
QA and

[01:09:51.080 --> 01:09:52.840]
I've got a phone and

[01:09:57.420 --> 01:09:58.160]
WQA and Hello

[01:09:58.920 --> 01:10:00.440]
That's a that's a food bee

[01:10:02.660 --> 01:10:03.360]
It's a what?

[01:10:05.060 --> 01:10:05.420]
Kaka?

[01:10:06.340 --> 01:10:07.140]
WQA and Hello

[01:10:09.540 --> 01:10:10.320]
WQA and Hello

[01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:14.440]
Yes, I saw Rocky 37 yesterday

[01:10:15.340 --> 01:10:15.700]
And

[01:10:17.060 --> 01:10:17.640]
He lost

[01:10:18.100 --> 01:10:21.960]
Oh, okay, thanks for those. I'm going to have to waste our money in our time on it. Piece of crap

[01:10:24.360 --> 01:10:26.260]
Slice the law and is this guy got talent?

[01:10:26.260 --> 01:10:27.060]
No, can he act?

[01:10:27.460 --> 01:10:29.280]
No, he's garbage

[01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:32.200]
He just turned 90 by the way, not really. He votes on the pool

[01:10:33.380 --> 01:10:35.080]
5, 6, 7, come on, keep him coming

[01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:36.460]
Baby, you can do it right up till 2

[01:10:36.460 --> 01:10:37.460]
You can do I'm positive

[01:10:39.700 --> 01:10:41.740]
I think starting tomorrow we're doing the music format

[01:10:42.180 --> 01:10:44.380]
All right, oldies, oldie moldies

[01:10:44.380 --> 01:10:45.560]
Something old, something new

[01:10:45.560 --> 01:10:48.500]
There's a definite void for that in the market. We got all these great jingles

[01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:52.000]
Effect there's one guy that used to work for the beesleys

[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:53.240]
I think it was a trap

[01:10:53.240 --> 01:10:56.480]
In a lot of these messages you get, a lot of these emails you get on my space

[01:10:56.940 --> 01:11:01.440]
They're a trap and he wants you to write back and say oh yeah the beesleys, they're waiting

[01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:04.320]
Cycle, Christ already said

[01:11:04.320 --> 01:11:08.280]
Oh, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you

[01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:13.100]
I love you, I love you, I love you

[01:11:13.100 --> 01:11:16.580]
Oh yeah, we got so many jingles man, might as well put them to use

[01:11:17.060 --> 01:11:19.140]
What a waste have them sitting there in the DCS

[01:11:19.140 --> 01:11:21.160]
And now the Chris is going to be starting tomorrow, right?

[01:11:22.120 --> 01:11:26.300]
Yeah, we don't want to have to put a lot of pressure on him on the very first official day of the jump

[01:11:26.300 --> 01:11:29.500]
Assuming that Josh is actually going over to the other side

[01:11:29.500 --> 01:11:30.060]
I am

[01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:31.900]
Oh it's official now?

[01:11:33.180 --> 01:11:38.340]
Well, like I said Clarence said for Chris and I to decide and we decided tomorrow

[01:11:38.340 --> 01:11:39.700]
Let's stop prolonging this

[01:11:40.780 --> 01:11:42.600]
For Chris and I to decide

[01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:45.000]
Well what does that mean?

[01:11:45.100 --> 01:11:48.620]
Meaning like I have to show him a few things and I feel like he knows more

[01:11:49.420 --> 01:11:50.900]
Yeah, that's why he ran out of there

[01:11:50.900 --> 01:11:52.840]
That's why he ran out of there, you should have seen it

[01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:54.240]
I don't want to see it

[01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:56.820]
It's not what you think

[01:11:56.820 --> 01:11:58.280]
Show him a few things

[01:11:58.860 --> 01:12:00.800]
Oh brother, I didn't expect that color

[01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:05.520]
Oh brother, talk about another shade of pale

[01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:08.060]
Good for Chris, yeah good for him, run him out

[01:12:09.680 --> 01:12:12.200]
Damn good thing, Muff didn't come in there in the middle of that demonstration

[01:12:14.140 --> 01:12:16.700]
990p votes, we're going to have a thousand votes by the end of the break

[01:12:16.700 --> 01:12:17.940]
Which really makes me feel

[01:12:17.940 --> 01:12:18.960]
I like it

[01:12:22.280 --> 01:12:25.440]
You wanted more and you got it

[01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:29.980]
The man's dog is back singing more duet on the bandage scene

[01:12:29.980 --> 01:12:32.700]
You too

[01:12:32.700 --> 01:12:33.480]
Yeah

[01:12:34.700 --> 01:12:35.060]
Yeah

[01:12:35.060 --> 01:12:35.180]
Yeah

[01:12:35.180 --> 01:12:35.860]
Yeah

[01:12:40.700 --> 01:12:46.540]
Over the 80s is back carrying up with the great singing more take his

[01:12:46.540 --> 01:12:51.300]
Which even more big stars the mad dog does them all

[01:12:51.300 --> 01:12:52.320]
Baby

[01:12:52.320 --> 01:12:54.080]
Everything

All right

[01:12:56.700 --> 01:12:58.700]
All right

[01:13:00.200 --> 01:13:01.880]

[01:13:15.780 --> 01:13:16.620]
All right

[01:13:16.620 --> 01:13:20.900]
It's an all new British invasion

[01:13:20.900 --> 01:13:24.600]
With the mad dog singing like a man

[01:13:25.820 --> 01:13:27.400]
I like it

[01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:29.940]
I like it

[01:13:29.940 --> 01:13:31.860]
The truth is peeing out

[01:13:31.860 --> 01:13:31.860]

[01:13:31.860 --> 01:13:31.860]

[01:13:31.860 --> 01:13:31.860]

[01:13:31.860 --> 01:13:35.380]
That you managed was truly the fifth people

[01:13:35.380 --> 01:13:38.820]
You got to get it in love and he's giving it in love

[01:13:39.860 --> 01:13:41.960]
Everyone loves the land

[01:13:43.640 --> 01:13:46.480]
And now your head's to stay

[01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:50.140]
You know it's every stage you're gonna be all right

[01:13:50.140 --> 01:13:53.320]
And you're gonna be all right

[01:13:54.180 --> 01:13:58.640]
Here's the mad dog's ender and touching tribute to the king

[01:13:58.640 --> 01:14:00.600]
I love this

[01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:02.200]
All right

[01:14:03.260 --> 01:14:04.460]
All right

[01:14:05.380 --> 01:14:10.100]
That's a random among anyway

[01:14:12.060 --> 01:14:17.320]
The mad dog was just a little ambivalent when we asked him if he wanted to do it again

[01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:19.260]
Now I don't think so

[01:14:19.260 --> 01:14:24.520]
So we had Luke the Grotsey family with it and tell him either his brains or his signature would

[01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:28.500]
Why don't they contract that's some of the fish is cute

[01:14:28.500 --> 01:14:32.520]
All right

[01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:36.080]
All right

[01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:39.740]
All right

[01:14:39.740 --> 01:14:42.340]
And it's this volume new

[01:14:42.340 --> 01:14:44.600]
Available now if you move quickly

[01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:45.940]
All right

[01:14:46.520 --> 01:14:48.800]
All right

[01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:49.740]

[01:14:58.620 --> 01:14:58.620]

[01:14:58.620 --> 01:14:58.620]

[01:14:58.620 --> 01:14:59.320]
All right

[01:14:59.320 --> 01:14:59.340]

That's a wonderful

[01:15:10.860 --> 01:15:11.660]
Double UQM

[01:15:11.660 --> 01:15:12.800]
In Miami

[01:15:14.620 --> 01:15:15.760]
All the music all the time

[01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:16.900]
I'm pretty music-filled to a fly

[01:15:17.480 --> 01:15:17.960]
All right

[01:15:19.100 --> 01:15:20.560]
I'm not asking I'm telling

[01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:21.400]
And I would love it

[01:15:21.400 --> 01:15:23.580]
It's not a question of like all right or like

[01:15:24.080 --> 01:15:25.960]
I'm acknowledging not a proofy

[01:15:26.580 --> 01:15:28.120]
Well I mean I'm sitting here

[01:15:28.120 --> 01:15:31.260]
You know evaluating this whole Joe Bell business and I'm thinking to myself

[01:15:31.260 --> 01:15:33.860]
You know we've been over these many many years

[01:15:33.860 --> 01:15:35.580]
We're with some real losers

[01:15:36.440 --> 01:15:37.440]
Boozers and losers

[01:15:38.100 --> 01:15:40.780]
And this guy he just he don't get it

[01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:44.040]
I mean you know you spend 45 minutes on the phone

[01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:48.120]
This on the heels of that very important lunch you know with Bruce Beasley and Norman

[01:15:48.120 --> 01:15:55.080]
All those other crap and you you're spew your guts out and you tell them what you need and what you want and what life is all about and but a beep but a boop but a boop but a boop but a boop

[01:15:55.080 --> 01:15:56.700]
Oh yeah sure hey pal you know

[01:15:56.700 --> 01:16:00.740]
And then after 45 minutes on the phone it's like well I don't know what to tell you

[01:16:01.340 --> 01:16:02.480]
I know what to tell you

[01:16:03.500 --> 01:16:08.440]
The main reason I listen to Neil is for laughs 411 he's a freaking genius 362

[01:16:08.440 --> 01:16:16.280]
Those bedtime stories 50 to hear him suffer 43 I'm bored 41 I can understand the crazy colors 39

[01:16:16.280 --> 01:16:25.440]
He speaks the truth 32 a break from all sports 17 I hate Neil 15 and I hate this pool only 15 only 1 and a half percent

[01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.600]
I got is that thing real?

[01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:34.420]
You know the diamond just wasn't my style so I began working nights down here

[01:16:34.420 --> 01:16:40.700]
There's a janitor in the sole office building just to keep busy I guess because I'm a little bit more

It's a life away but I love everything and it's just the same

Her baby loves love, she's got a lot of things to say

[01:19:49.420 --> 01:19:54.960]
No more lonely days my baby's taken care of everything

[01:19:54.960 --> 01:19:59.320]

Last night I took a walk every time

[01:24:59.400 --> 01:25:02.400]
I played a play called Family Day Bar

[01:25:02.400 --> 01:25:06.480]
I had to come and see what I could see

[01:25:07.060 --> 01:25:09.640]
That brother, where I was, I was around

[01:25:09.640 --> 01:25:11.040]
I was certainly sure

[01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:14.220]
That girl and Thomas I was all alone here

[01:25:14.220 --> 01:25:17.880]
And I was always looking for a hand with me

[01:25:18.500 --> 01:25:21.420]
My heart was quiet and I was looking for a hand

[01:25:22.220 --> 01:25:26.180]
Together, down, I like a girl I'm going to pass

[01:25:26.180 --> 01:25:29.080]
I like a little kid, and around

[01:25:29.080 --> 01:25:31.380]
I like a merry-go-round

[01:25:31.380 --> 01:25:34.020]
Me and Lynn, and I were not friends

[01:25:34.020 --> 01:25:37.100]
They came around and were rocking bands

[01:25:37.100 --> 01:25:40.600]
And when I was looking for a hand girl I was

[01:25:40.600 --> 01:25:42.740]
And just one of us all

[01:25:42.740 --> 01:25:45.380]
You never know where the hands will

[01:25:45.380 --> 01:25:47.800]
When you stop them, one of us will burn

[01:25:47.800 --> 01:25:49.960]
And we'll let them tell it all

[01:25:50.600 --> 01:25:52.280]
That I call this a song

[01:26:12.060 --> 01:26:14.600]
We need to say that all of us are fair

[01:26:14.600 --> 01:26:17.580]
When and you're round, we're rocking bands

[01:26:17.580 --> 01:26:20.960]
And every single one I gave that girl a hug

[01:26:20.960 --> 01:26:23.440]
And just one of us all

[01:26:23.440 --> 01:26:25.900]
You never know where they took that ring

[01:26:25.900 --> 01:26:27.980]
And when you stop them, you have to come and tell them

[01:26:27.980 --> 01:26:30.140]
Where it's real, and I'm telling them

[01:26:30.140 --> 01:26:32.680]
Oh, I've got an acolyte card

[01:26:33.560 --> 01:26:36.320]
And I'm telling them it's hard to bear

[01:26:36.320 --> 01:26:38.680]
You know it's hard to bear

[01:26:39.680 --> 01:26:42.120]

[01:32:07.280 --> 01:32:13.020]
Remember

[01:32:14.280 --> 01:32:15.820]
It's Golden Gasser

[01:32:17.280 --> 01:32:21.100]
Wonderful

[01:32:22.280 --> 01:32:23.820]
WQAM

[01:32:25.280 --> 01:32:31.760]
You're fairy

[01:32:38.560 --> 01:32:40.100]
Ready woman

[01:32:40.100 --> 01:32:42.640]
Walking down the street

[01:32:42.640 --> 01:32:44.000]
Ready woman

[01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.320]
What kind of I like to meet

[01:32:46.320 --> 01:32:47.720]
Ready woman

[01:32:49.280 --> 01:32:50.820]
I don't mind if you

[01:32:50.820 --> 01:32:52.420]
You're not the truth

[01:32:52.420 --> 01:32:57.280]
No one could look that good at you

[01:32:58.940 --> 01:32:59.860]
Merced

[01:33:03.860 --> 01:33:05.280]
Ready woman

[01:33:05.360 --> 01:33:08.040]
Won't you pardon me

[01:33:08.040 --> 01:33:09.420]
Pretty woman

[01:33:09.420 --> 01:33:11.780]
I couldn't ever see

[01:33:12.360 --> 01:33:13.700]
Pretty woman

[01:33:14.360 --> 01:33:16.380]
And you don't know me

[01:33:16.380 --> 01:33:18.660]
That can be

[01:33:18.660 --> 01:33:20.000]
Are you lonely

[01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:23.360]
And just like me

[01:33:24.360 --> 01:33:25.100]
Oh

[01:33:26.360 --> 01:33:27.240]
Hey

[01:33:31.360 --> 01:33:32.240]
Ready woman

[01:33:51.520 --> 01:33:55.960]
I don't mind if you

[01:33:55.960 --> 01:33:57.260]
Are you lonely

[01:33:57.260 --> 01:33:57.260]

[01:33:57.260 --> 01:33:57.260]

[01:33:57.260 --> 01:34:00.840]
Ready woman

[01:34:00.840 --> 01:34:01.740]
I don't mind if you

[01:34:01.740 --> 01:34:03.300]
Are you lonely

[01:34:03.300 --> 01:34:05.540]
I'll treat you right

[01:34:05.540 --> 01:34:09.160]
Come with me, baby

[01:34:10.740 --> 01:34:12.740]
Remind tonight

[01:34:18.140 --> 01:34:19.960]
Ready woman

[01:34:19.960 --> 01:34:22.580]
Don't walk on bike

[01:34:22.580 --> 01:34:23.800]
Pretty woman

[01:34:23.800 --> 01:34:26.300]
Don't make me cry

[01:34:26.300 --> 01:34:28.060]
Pretty woman

[01:34:28.060 --> 01:34:31.060]
Don't walk away

[01:34:31.060 --> 01:34:31.200]
Hey

[01:34:36.080 --> 01:34:36.840]
Okay

[01:34:38.380 --> 01:34:39.840]
You've got to wait

[01:34:39.840 --> 01:34:41.020]
Monthly

[01:34:43.700 --> 01:34:44.460]
Okay

[01:34:44.460 --> 01:34:46.660]
I just thought you were on home

[01:34:46.660 --> 01:34:47.560]
I played

[01:34:47.560 --> 01:34:50.380]
The next tomorrow night

[01:34:50.380 --> 01:34:51.920]
Put away

[01:34:51.920 --> 01:34:54.300]
What do I see

[01:34:55.060 --> 01:34:55.380]
Ah!

[01:34:59.420 --> 01:35:04.980]
Did you walk in the back to me

[01:35:04.980 --> 01:35:06.260]
Oh yeah

[01:35:07.180 --> 01:35:10.440]
Did you walk in the back to me

[01:35:13.300 --> 01:35:13.880]
Oh

[01:35:16.520 --> 01:35:17.680]
Pretty woman

[01:35:18.380 --> 01:35:20.120]
A little bit of a format change this afternoon

[01:35:20.120 --> 01:35:21.740]
You have something I'm kind of enjoying it myself

[01:35:21.740 --> 01:35:24.100]
Yeah well you haven't played a song I don't like yet

[01:35:24.100 --> 01:35:24.800]
Well there you go

[01:35:24.800 --> 01:35:26.580]
Oh man I taste in the oldies

[01:35:26.580 --> 01:35:28.000]
I'm talking about moldy oldies

[01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:28.120]
Right

[01:35:28.120 --> 01:35:28.600]
Is the best

[01:35:28.600 --> 01:35:29.100]
And I don't know

[01:35:29.100 --> 01:35:31.800]
Is that even Ricky Tiki's probably tipping his smelly camp to me

[01:35:32.340 --> 01:35:34.400]
You know I said here and I finally decided

[01:35:34.400 --> 01:35:35.620]
You know I finally butched up

[01:35:35.620 --> 01:35:37.820]
Remember I was talking about an hour ago about butchering up a little bit

[01:35:37.820 --> 01:35:38.920]
Yes he worked

[01:35:38.920 --> 01:35:41.160]
And I can't depend on Linfrist and Norma Kent

[01:35:41.160 --> 01:35:42.920]
Because she's got a composer letter

[01:35:42.920 --> 01:35:46.620]
And she's got a while in between runaways or whatever he's doing

[01:35:46.620 --> 01:35:49.300]
And of course smoky Joe Bell

[01:35:49.300 --> 01:35:51.060]
That's his whole thing is blowing smoke

[01:35:51.060 --> 01:35:52.600]
You know as you discovered on Friday

[01:35:54.960 --> 01:35:55.720]
Blowing smoke

[01:35:55.720 --> 01:35:57.340]
Well you were probably had the old

[01:35:57.940 --> 01:35:59.400]
But that's beside the point

[01:35:59.400 --> 01:36:02.900]
So I'm just going to give it back

[01:36:02.900 --> 01:36:03.740]
You know what I mean by that?

[01:36:04.060 --> 01:36:04.340]
I do

[01:36:04.920 --> 01:36:05.360]
Exactly

[01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:07.400]
They want to give me like a lame effort

[01:36:07.400 --> 01:36:09.120]
I'll give them the same

[01:36:09.120 --> 01:36:11.060]
The main reason I listen to Neil is

[01:36:11.060 --> 01:36:12.000]
A thousand ninety two votes

[01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.520]
And of course we could probably add the nifty oldie music

[01:36:14.520 --> 01:36:15.540]
But we won't do that yet

[01:36:16.440 --> 01:36:17.500]
Till a couple of weeks

[01:36:17.500 --> 01:36:19.160]
Oh oh

[01:36:19.160 --> 01:36:22.520]
The main reason I listen is for laughs 435

[01:36:22.520 --> 01:36:25.160]
He's a freaking genius 375

[01:36:25.160 --> 01:36:27.000]
Those bedtime stories 51

[01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000]
He speaks the truth 47

[01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:30.900]
Well that's climbing the ladder does it matter?

[01:36:31.140 --> 01:36:31.360]
No

[01:36:31.360 --> 01:36:33.180]
To hear him suffer 47

[01:36:33.180 --> 01:36:34.820]
Because he works for the beesleys

[01:36:34.820 --> 01:36:36.160]
I'm bored 46

[01:36:36.160 --> 01:36:37.780]
The crazy caller is 41

[01:36:38.500 --> 01:36:39.680]
A break from all sports 18

[01:36:39.680 --> 01:36:41.080]
I hate this poll 17

[01:36:41.080 --> 01:36:44.540]
I hate Neil like poison that miserable old bastard 15

[01:36:45.580 --> 01:36:46.800]
I just pray to quit

[01:36:46.800 --> 01:36:49.080]
I like to shave my legs, arms and buns

[01:36:49.080 --> 01:36:50.740]
While listening to the Neil Rogers

[01:36:50.740 --> 01:36:51.840]
One to two hours

[01:37:17.820 --> 01:37:20.400]
I hate this poll 17

[01:37:20.400 --> 01:37:21.380]
I hate this poll 17

[01:37:21.380 --> 01:37:22.560]
I hate this poll 17

[01:37:22.560 --> 01:37:24.820]
I hate this poll 17

[01:37:24.820 --> 01:37:26.140]
I hate this poll 17

[01:37:26.140 --> 01:37:27.420]
I hate this poll 17

[01:37:27.420 --> 01:37:29.040]
I hate this poll 17

[01:37:29.040 --> 01:37:31.140]
I hate this poll 17

[01:37:31.140 --> 01:37:31.460]
I hate this poll 17

[01:37:31.460 --> 01:37:33.520]
We're hopping in the time machine

[01:37:33.520 --> 01:37:36.320]
Hold on, won't you come along and change?

[01:37:36.900 --> 01:37:36.900]

[01:37:37.120 --> 01:37:40.360]
Here's the golden vector from the WQAN

[01:37:41.280 --> 01:37:42.620]
Right now

[01:37:42.620 --> 01:37:45.140]
The golden vector

[01:37:45.140 --> 01:37:49.540]
I hate this poll 17

[01:37:49.540 --> 01:37:51.040]
The WQAN

[01:37:51.620 --> 01:37:52.760]
In Miami

[01:37:53.620 --> 01:37:58.100]
The most music

[01:37:58.100 --> 01:38:01.620]
The WQAN

[01:38:02.380 --> 01:38:04.620]
The WQAN

[01:38:05.160 --> 01:38:05.780]
The WQAN

[01:38:05.780 --> 01:38:08.620]
The WQAN

[01:38:08.620 --> 01:38:09.660]
Oh, alright

[01:38:14.620 --> 01:38:17.740]
I'll sleep in and lie in the middle of a good dream

[01:38:17.740 --> 01:38:23.380]
I thought it was a wake-up from something that keeps knocking at my brain

[01:38:23.380 --> 01:38:25.640]
You're fair with four I go and say

[01:38:25.640 --> 01:38:28.180]
I hold my pillow to my head

[01:38:28.180 --> 01:38:30.520]
And spring up in my bed

[01:38:30.520 --> 01:38:32.860]
Streaming out the words I've read

[01:38:32.860 --> 01:38:35.240]
I think I love her, you know

[01:38:35.240 --> 01:38:36.820]
I think I love you

[01:38:37.860 --> 01:38:41.440]
This morning I woke up with this feeling

[01:38:41.440 --> 01:38:44.400]
I didn't know how to deal with it

[01:38:44.400 --> 01:38:47.180]
And so I just decided to myself

[01:38:47.180 --> 01:38:49.580]
I'd hide it to myself

[01:38:49.580 --> 01:38:52.560]
And never talk about it

[01:38:52.560 --> 01:38:56.660]
And did not go and shout it when you walked into it

[01:38:56.660 --> 01:38:58.440]
I think I love her

[01:39:01.120 --> 01:39:03.140]
I think I love you

[01:39:03.140 --> 01:39:05.560]
For one of my four brain-outs

[01:39:05.560 --> 01:39:08.180]
I'm a breath that I'm not sure of

[01:39:08.180 --> 01:39:10.620]
A love there is no cure for

[01:39:11.560 --> 01:39:12.000]
I'm not me

[01:39:13.560 --> 01:39:14.940]
I think I love you

[01:39:14.940 --> 01:39:17.160]
This is not what life can fail

[01:39:17.160 --> 01:39:18.900]
You like it always

[01:39:18.900 --> 01:39:20.420]
We're in need of things

[01:39:20.420 --> 01:39:22.780]
But I never felt this way

[01:39:44.280 --> 01:39:52.500]
I think I love you

[01:39:52.500 --> 01:39:53.060]
I think I love you

[01:39:53.060 --> 01:39:54.960]
For one of my four brain-outs

[01:39:54.960 --> 01:39:57.440]
I'm a breath that I'm not sure of

[01:39:57.440 --> 01:39:59.940]
A love there is no cure for

[01:40:02.240 --> 01:40:04.200]
I think I love you

[01:40:04.200 --> 01:40:04.860]
This morning I woke up with this feeling

[01:40:04.860 --> 01:40:05.040]
I think I love you

[01:40:05.040 --> 01:40:05.540]
This is not what life can fail

[01:40:05.540 --> 01:40:05.540]

[01:40:07.180 --> 01:40:09.220]
So it's what it's made of

[01:40:09.220 --> 01:40:12.320]
I never felt this way

[01:40:12.320 --> 01:40:15.680]
You really don't have to worry

[01:40:15.680 --> 01:40:17.960]
I only want to make you happy

[01:40:17.960 --> 01:40:21.460]
And if you shake it away, I will

[01:40:21.460 --> 01:40:24.080]
But I think there's still a better way

[01:40:24.080 --> 01:40:25.300]
I'd better stay around

[01:40:25.300 --> 01:40:26.240]
And love you

[01:40:26.240 --> 01:40:28.360]
You think I have a need

[01:40:28.360 --> 01:40:30.160]
Let me ask you to

[01:40:30.160 --> 01:40:31.120]
You'll think here

[01:40:31.120 --> 01:40:32.580]
Let me cure love me

[01:40:32.580 --> 01:40:34.700]
I think I love you

[01:40:34.700 --> 01:40:36.980]
I think I love you

[01:40:37.700 --> 01:40:39.340]
I think I love you

[01:40:39.340 --> 01:40:41.660]
I think I love you

[01:40:41.660 --> 01:40:43.960]
I think I love you

[01:40:43.960 --> 01:40:46.120]
I think I love you

[01:40:46.700 --> 01:40:47.580]
Well, I sure love him

[01:40:47.580 --> 01:40:48.820]
I'll say that very proudly

[01:40:48.820 --> 01:40:49.960]
But that's a long time ago

[01:40:49.960 --> 01:40:51.560]
That's another era and another age

[01:40:51.560 --> 01:40:55.200]
But anyway, hey David, you're ferried

[01:40:55.200 --> 01:40:57.740]
So I'm going to chapter one at 560 WDQ

[01:40:57.740 --> 01:40:59.140]
I'm a little format-change here today

[01:40:59.140 --> 01:41:00.360]
You know something we might like enough

[01:41:00.360 --> 01:41:01.760]
It might continue all week long

[01:41:01.760 --> 01:41:03.500]
You know what I was jamming out to that

[01:41:04.060 --> 01:41:04.560]
We're here

[01:41:04.560 --> 01:41:05.720]
There's a whole lot of segment there

[01:41:05.720 --> 01:41:06.400]
You've been on it?

[01:41:06.500 --> 01:41:08.940]
Just ask Josh, man, I was a one-man karaoke show in here

[01:41:08.940 --> 01:41:09.740]
I love you, man

[01:41:09.740 --> 01:41:10.540]
I like this so much

[01:41:10.540 --> 01:41:10.900]
I like this so far

[01:41:10.900 --> 01:41:12.420]
And I'm Josh probably don't like into this music

[01:41:12.420 --> 01:41:14.020]
Because it's way before his time

[01:41:14.020 --> 01:41:15.300]
I don't have a problem with it

[01:41:15.300 --> 01:41:16.640]
I'm not listening to it into my car

[01:41:16.640 --> 01:41:17.920]
But I don't have a problem with it

[01:41:17.920 --> 01:41:18.540]
Do you like it?

[01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:19.500]
I do

[01:41:21.040 --> 01:41:21.760]
Well, I'm good

[01:41:22.400 --> 01:41:24.240]
Because we want you to go on in your last day

[01:41:24.240 --> 01:41:25.380]
With a big smile on your face

[01:41:25.380 --> 01:41:25.760]
You know?

[01:41:28.580 --> 01:41:30.280]
Are you going up with a big smile on your face?

[01:41:31.360 --> 01:41:31.680]
He's good

[01:41:31.680 --> 01:41:32.160]
He's good

[01:41:32.680 --> 01:41:35.080]
From the early year on your big fat push

[01:41:36.140 --> 01:41:37.180]
1125 votes on a pole

[01:41:37.180 --> 01:41:38.300]
We're not too bad on there

[01:41:39.680 --> 01:41:41.660]
I don't know what this line really means

[01:41:41.660 --> 01:41:42.680]
Maybe if it's explained to me

[01:41:42.680 --> 01:41:44.180]
It's the new year, are your feet hurting?

[01:41:45.480 --> 01:41:45.880]
No

[01:41:46.740 --> 01:41:47.140]
What?

[01:41:47.580 --> 01:41:49.140]
Oh, I thought you were asking me a question

[01:41:49.140 --> 01:41:50.580]
Can you explain what that line means?

[01:41:50.620 --> 01:41:51.420]
No, I can't

[01:41:51.420 --> 01:41:52.740]
I asked Brian Schmuss, maybe he'll say this

[01:41:52.740 --> 01:41:53.740]
I'm not talking about your pretty side

[01:41:53.740 --> 01:41:53.980]
Am I junior, honey?

[01:41:53.980 --> 01:41:53.980]

[01:41:54.400 --> 01:41:56.460]
Am I junior, honey?

[01:41:56.700 --> 01:41:57.500]
I'm going down the shower

[01:41:57.500 --> 01:41:59.420]
Where the mother wants

[01:41:59.420 --> 01:42:02.740]
Go to hang from trees and play banjo

[01:42:02.740 --> 01:42:05.440]
You got some food on the station

[01:42:05.440 --> 01:42:07.840]
All new Frank won't be ready

[01:42:07.840 --> 01:42:09.880]
Oh, now as North

[01:42:10.420 --> 01:42:12.500]
Carolina goes

[01:42:12.500 --> 01:42:14.640]
Rolly's a big city

[01:42:14.640 --> 01:42:15.180]
You know?

[01:42:15.560 --> 01:42:18.380]
And that's where the beesleaves had to go

[01:42:18.380 --> 01:42:20.800]
For Golly, Riley Joe

[01:42:20.800 --> 01:42:23.900]
Oh, I knew GM

[01:42:25.120 --> 01:42:27.180]
He'll do what he can

[01:42:27.180 --> 01:42:30.420]
Shake your hand like a friend

[01:42:30.420 --> 01:42:33.120]
Then quickly walk away

[01:42:33.120 --> 01:42:37.140]
They had Joe go to five-six-oh

[01:42:37.140 --> 01:42:40.080]
With ratings and the toilet mold

[01:42:40.080 --> 01:42:41.120]
To get those

[01:42:41.120 --> 01:42:43.680]
Flaming sportful mose

[01:42:43.680 --> 01:42:45.580]
In order and control

[01:42:45.580 --> 01:42:47.420]
And then so

[01:42:47.420 --> 01:42:49.680]
Golly, Rolly Joe

[01:42:49.680 --> 01:42:51.400]
A vah-fueler

[01:42:51.400 --> 01:42:53.640]
And in the loathe let's mose

[01:42:53.640 --> 01:42:55.960]
Go and hear what blows

[01:42:55.960 --> 01:42:58.320]
Golly is on show

[01:42:59.300 --> 01:43:01.820]
He'll make a big change

[01:43:01.820 --> 01:43:04.760]
And read a range

[01:43:04.760 --> 01:43:07.580]
It's worse for the same

[01:43:07.580 --> 01:43:10.700]
He hasn't done a thing

[01:43:10.700 --> 01:43:12.340]
No, for what goes

[01:43:12.960 --> 01:43:14.540]
All the air had to

[01:43:14.540 --> 01:43:17.460]
Joe don't have a stinkin' clue

[01:43:17.460 --> 01:43:18.520]
About a poor

[01:43:18.520 --> 01:43:20.300]
Not that essentially

[01:43:20.300 --> 01:43:22.840]
Blows sportful radio

[01:43:22.840 --> 01:43:24.520]
The GM

[01:43:24.520 --> 01:43:27.000]
Oh, five-six-oh

[01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.180]
Golly, Rolly Joe

[01:43:29.180 --> 01:43:32.640]
Seek K of W. Motham Sound

[01:43:42.840 --> 01:43:43.140]
Ah!

[01:43:43.980 --> 01:43:46.160]
Night's sweet morning dew

[01:43:46.840 --> 01:43:48.860]
I took one look at you

[01:43:48.860 --> 01:43:50.980]
And it was plain to

[01:43:50.980 --> 01:43:53.480]
You were my destiny

[01:43:54.260 --> 01:43:56.580]
If I was open wide

[01:43:56.580 --> 01:43:59.200]
I knew it would be my pride

[01:43:59.200 --> 01:44:01.600]
I'm satisfied to use

[01:44:01.600 --> 01:44:04.140]
That it came out of love for you

[01:44:04.140 --> 01:44:05.760]
Golly, Rolly Joe

[01:44:05.760 --> 01:44:06.340]
When you leave

[01:44:06.340 --> 01:44:08.440]
I'm always begging time

[01:44:08.440 --> 01:44:09.120]
Oh, baby

[01:44:10.140 --> 01:44:11.360]
You will win

[01:44:11.360 --> 01:44:13.060]
You will be there for me

[01:44:13.060 --> 01:44:15.260]
There's no need to know

[01:44:15.260 --> 01:44:16.880]
No, no, no, no

[01:44:16.880 --> 01:44:18.000]
For what?

[01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:20.540]
We got love

[01:44:20.540 --> 01:44:23.160]
Show love that you know

[01:44:23.160 --> 01:44:24.400]
You're home

[01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:26.960]
You're home I need

[01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.360]
To get by

[01:44:30.360 --> 01:44:34.420]
Oh, baby

[01:44:34.420 --> 01:44:36.880]
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[01:44:36.880 --> 01:44:37.760]
Baby, ooh, baby

[01:44:38.780 --> 01:44:41.160]
Like an evil object'sness

[01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:43.900]
But you have to do my thing

[01:44:43.900 --> 01:44:46.200]
Stand by it like a tree

[01:44:46.200 --> 01:44:48.920]
And then everybody could try to do me

[01:44:48.920 --> 01:44:51.220]
Darling in you I found

[01:44:51.220 --> 01:44:53.920]
Strangler hours told that

[01:44:53.920 --> 01:44:56.180]
Don't know what she's told

[01:44:56.180 --> 01:44:58.080]
Together we can only live

[01:44:58.080 --> 01:45:00.100]
Don't lose the end

[01:45:00.100 --> 01:45:01.640]
Come on darling

[01:45:01.640 --> 01:45:03.940]
And I'm fighting you little higher

[01:45:03.940 --> 01:45:05.840]
You can't make me

[01:45:05.840 --> 01:45:07.960]
I was born in the hour

[01:45:07.960 --> 01:45:09.320]
Of course we

[01:45:10.200 --> 01:45:11.640]
We got the right

[01:45:11.640 --> 01:45:13.020]
Federation

[01:45:13.640 --> 01:45:15.840]
And we're in love at the

[01:45:15.840 --> 01:45:17.760]
Trial and ratio

[01:45:17.760 --> 01:45:20.640]
Oh, you're home

[01:45:20.640 --> 01:45:22.380]
What's that for you

[01:45:22.380 --> 01:45:23.580]
And for you

[01:45:23.580 --> 01:45:25.540]
Oh, all the jokes

[01:45:25.540 --> 01:45:27.080]
I love the stuff

[01:45:27.080 --> 01:45:28.680]
And the one you're

[01:45:28.680 --> 01:45:31.140]
Oh, you're home I need

[01:45:33.960 --> 01:45:35.900]
You're home I need

[01:45:38.880 --> 01:45:41.280]
You're home I need

[01:45:41.280 --> 01:45:45.100]
Oh, all the jokes

[01:45:45.100 --> 01:45:45.880]
Wherever you go

[01:45:45.880 --> 01:45:50.220]
Go go with 77 WAV

[01:45:50.220 --> 01:45:51.080]
See

[01:45:53.300 --> 01:45:54.900]
Go go

[01:45:54.900 --> 01:45:57.720]
I don't want the world to know

[01:45:58.800 --> 01:46:02.140]
Find a world where I hope to show

[01:46:04.500 --> 01:46:06.700]
To faces I have

[01:46:20.700 --> 01:46:24.000]
I'm not a man.

[01:46:24.480 --> 01:46:25.600]
I'm not a man.

[01:46:27.780 --> 01:46:29.260]
I'm not a man.

[01:46:29.360 --> 01:46:29.520]
I'm not a man.

[01:46:29.900 --> 01:46:30.900]
I'm not a man.

[01:46:30.900 --> 01:46:30.960]
I'm not a man.

[01:46:31.220 --> 01:46:31.220]

[01:46:31.360 --> 01:46:31.960]
I'm not a man.

[01:46:31.960 --> 01:46:31.960]

[01:46:31.960 --> 01:46:31.960]

[01:46:31.960 --> 01:46:32.900]
I'm not a man.

[01:46:33.620 --> 01:46:34.140]
I'm not a man.

[01:46:34.140 --> 01:46:35.200]
I'm not a man.

[01:46:35.480 --> 01:46:36.480]
I'm not a man.

[01:46:36.480 --> 01:46:37.180]
I am not a man.

[01:46:37.620 --> 01:46:45.020]
That's why I know he cannot eat you.

[01:46:45.020 --> 01:46:47.860]
He has to laugh.

[01:46:51.440 --> 01:46:55.900]
He has to laugh for it.

[01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:56.080]
He has to cry.

[01:46:56.080 --> 01:46:57.680]
He can't pay me any money.

[01:46:58.380 --> 01:47:01.620]
Lord earth can't afford him.

[01:47:02.480 --> 01:47:03.880]
He has to say so.

[01:47:18.560 --> 01:47:33.860]
I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a

[01:47:33.860 --> 01:47:50.840]
man, I'm a man... I'm a man my dove, I'm a man..., I'm a man... I'm a woman, I'm a man's

[01:47:50.840 --> 01:48:03.840]
I'm a man my love, I'm bersy, I'm a man. I'm a maid-pano, a smart girl, but I'm

[01:48:03.840 --> 01:48:06.280]
And I will give you a B.C.

[01:48:06.960 --> 01:48:08.340]
Go, go, go!

[01:48:22.480 --> 01:48:26.380]
Oh, all the diamonds of the town

[01:48:26.380 --> 01:48:28.620]
And the diamonds are just right away

[01:48:28.620 --> 01:48:30.720]
All they get for the city

[01:48:30.720 --> 01:48:32.620]
And it's going to my best call

[01:48:32.620 --> 01:48:34.480]
No more ease at all

[01:48:34.480 --> 01:48:36.060]
Bring it back to me

[01:48:36.060 --> 01:48:38.440]
Here it is, all in for

[01:48:38.440 --> 01:48:40.820]
The way we live

[01:48:40.820 --> 01:48:43.500]
How the things open to the world

[01:48:43.500 --> 01:48:45.580]
Are feeling inside

[01:48:45.580 --> 01:48:51.500]
Will you be the things that open to the world

[01:48:51.500 --> 01:48:53.460]
Are feeling inside

[01:48:53.460 --> 01:49:00.480]
Will you be the things that open to the world

[01:49:00.480 --> 01:49:00.960]
Who I saw on the TV, for each one

[01:49:00.960 --> 01:49:02.020]
So I would I knew

[01:49:02.020 --> 01:49:03.380]
But I love you

[01:49:03.380 --> 01:49:06.620]
If I a你們 was somebody

[01:49:06.620 --> 01:49:10.980]
We'd walkin', I'd love you

[01:49:10.980 --> 01:49:13.500]
Yeah, I'll love you

[01:49:13.500 --> 01:49:17.100]
If I could, he'd always stand by

[01:49:17.100 --> 01:49:19.180]
The key to aowanie

[01:49:19.180 --> 01:49:23.160]
I can't make this hell of a shot to run for a while.

[01:49:24.140 --> 01:49:29.600]
Always with every chance I remember me or what I need.

[01:49:31.020 --> 01:49:33.960]
I was not the one who saw my death,

[01:49:34.360 --> 01:49:36.000]
I could do a lot of things,

[01:49:36.180 --> 01:49:38.180]
I could not stop being alone.

[01:49:39.100 --> 01:49:40.020]
I love you,

[01:49:40.940 --> 01:49:42.340]
you saw my heart,

[01:49:42.540 --> 01:49:43.300]
you saw it,

[01:49:43.420 --> 01:49:45.060]
you saw it,

[01:49:45.060 --> 01:49:47.140]
I love you,

[01:49:50.680 --> 01:49:54.560]
you saw my heart,

[01:49:54.560 --> 01:49:55.820]
you saw my heart.

[01:49:56.120 --> 01:50:02.580]
I tried my best to go,

[01:50:02.580 --> 01:50:03.880]
my favorite job to go,

[01:50:04.220 --> 01:50:07.160]
I was not the one who saw my heart,

[01:50:07.160 --> 01:50:08.460]
no one you should be,

[01:50:08.840 --> 01:50:10.640]
you should be easy,

[01:50:11.080 --> 01:50:11.820]
you should be easy,

[01:50:11.820 --> 01:50:11.820]

[01:50:12.420 --> 01:50:12.420]

[01:50:13.280 --> 01:50:14.960]
you should be easy,

[01:50:15.960 --> 01:50:17.140]
you see my heart,

[01:50:17.140 --> 01:50:17.140]

[01:50:17.140 --> 01:50:17.560]
I'm so nervous,

[01:50:17.860 --> 01:50:20.740]
I know it's you,

[01:50:22.860 --> 01:50:30.260]
I love you,

[01:50:30.340 --> 01:50:31.360]
I love you,

[01:50:32.960 --> 01:50:33.920]
you saw my heart

[01:50:34.960 --> 01:50:37.200]
you saw my heart

[01:50:37.960 --> 01:50:42.320]
you saw my heart

[01:50:42.320 --> 01:50:44.940]
you saw my heart,

[01:50:44.940 --> 01:50:49.220]
I love to be with you, just for all I know,

[01:50:49.440 --> 01:50:52.420]
and I love you, just for all I know,

[01:50:52.420 --> 01:50:56.060]
I love to be with you, just for all I know,

[01:50:56.060 --> 01:50:58.180]
and I love to be with you, just for all I know,

[01:50:58.180 --> 01:51:01.860]
and I love to be with you, just for all I know,

[01:51:01.860 --> 01:51:02.600]
okay, so how am I doing?

[01:51:02.780 --> 01:51:04.060]
okay, so you'll bet in the thousands I hope?

[01:51:04.280 --> 01:51:06.060]
yes you are, I'm doing a CV.

[01:51:06.380 --> 01:51:07.940]
I'm belting out to Lucrissy in here man,

[01:51:08.260 --> 01:51:09.160]
I'm a horse from that.

[01:51:09.380 --> 01:51:11.400]
now I have a request for my last day.

[01:51:11.820 --> 01:51:14.640]
yes, now let's, we're in the 60s right now

[01:51:14.640 --> 01:51:15.360]
am I correct on that?

[01:51:15.460 --> 01:51:17.780]
right, okay let's try like 70s next segment

[01:51:17.780 --> 01:51:18.360]
see what you got.

[01:51:19.460 --> 01:51:20.880]
he's still good through the 70s.

[01:51:21.160 --> 01:51:22.360]
okay now I'm just, I'm just seeing,

[01:51:22.640 --> 01:51:24.300]
because I, I'm just seeing in the 60s.

[01:51:24.320 --> 01:51:26.740]
I see an 80 half that anyone all crazy, I don't know what that is.

[01:51:30.660 --> 01:51:31.960]
let's see how about ELO?

[01:51:33.960 --> 01:51:34.680]
excellent 70s?

[01:51:34.900 --> 01:51:35.140]
yes.

[01:51:36.020 --> 01:51:37.480]
well you're, you like it, I know that.

[01:51:38.360 --> 01:51:39.640]
well you want about Josh?

[01:51:39.920 --> 01:51:40.640]
you like it?

[01:51:41.520 --> 01:51:43.240]
I don't know, I'm going to have to hear it.

[01:51:43.240 --> 01:51:44.020]
ELO?

[01:51:44.340 --> 01:51:45.680]
oh brother, oh.

[01:51:46.840 --> 01:51:47.860]
1148 votes on the pool.

[01:51:47.940 --> 01:51:50.540]
the main reason I listen to Neil is for a last 456.

[01:51:51.160 --> 01:51:52.800]
he's a freaking genius 386.

[01:51:53.080 --> 01:51:54.360]
he speaks the truth 64.

[01:51:54.960 --> 01:51:56.540]
and you ain't heard nothing yet believe me.

[01:51:57.280 --> 01:51:58.680]
those bedtime stories 52,

[01:51:58.980 --> 01:52:00.800]
to hear him suffer 49, not no mo,

[01:52:01.100 --> 01:52:02.300]
no more suffering for this good.

[01:52:02.900 --> 01:52:04.200]
because I'm bored 48.

[01:52:04.700 --> 01:52:06.840]
the crazy caller is 42, all three of them.

[01:52:07.560 --> 01:52:08.880]
a break from all sports 18.

[01:52:09.280 --> 01:52:11.120]
I hate this pool 17 and I hate Neil.

[01:52:11.120 --> 01:52:13.260]
I wish he would die 16.

[01:52:16.040 --> 01:52:16.680]
absolutely.

[01:53:11.120 --> 01:53:12.160]
he's a fucking genius.

[01:53:12.160 --> 01:53:17.440]
he's got the two things he's supposed to do.

[01:53:17.440 --> 01:53:19.040]
he's a push guy.

[01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:23.120]
he's a push guy.

[01:53:23.600 --> 01:53:26.060]
he's a push guy.

[01:53:27.660 --> 01:53:29.720]
he's a push guy.

[01:53:31.380 --> 01:53:32.680]
he's a genius.

[01:53:33.800 --> 01:53:37.120]
he's a genius.

[01:53:50.200 --> 01:53:52.300]
he's a fucking genius.

[01:53:58.440 --> 01:54:00.580]
he's a fucking genius.

[01:54:01.620 --> 01:54:03.840]
he's a fucking genius.

[01:54:03.840 --> 01:54:03.840]

[01:54:03.840 --> 01:54:03.840]

[01:54:03.840 --> 01:54:03.840]

[01:54:03.840 --> 01:54:03.840]

[01:54:03.860 --> 01:54:05.920]
he's a fucking genius.

[01:54:06.060 --> 01:54:07.100]
he's a fucking genius.

[01:54:07.100 --> 01:54:10.000]
he's a fucking genius.

[01:54:20.100 --> 01:54:22.600]
from 77 W ABC.

[01:54:23.720 --> 01:54:26.460]
go, go, go.

[01:55:07.260 --> 01:55:09.280]
just a matter of time

[01:55:09.280 --> 01:55:11.400]
you'll make up your mind

[01:55:12.100 --> 01:55:14.360]
come on and love that you've been hiding

[01:55:15.100 --> 01:55:16.820]
just a push you won't live

[01:55:16.820 --> 01:55:19.000]
I told you to come and get it

[01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:21.900]
I'll get on the love you've been denied

[01:55:21.900 --> 01:55:24.580]
he's a roller-lake of love

[01:55:24.580 --> 01:55:26.200]
it's all you've got to do

[01:55:26.200 --> 01:55:28.340]
you're a roller-lake of

[01:55:28.340 --> 01:55:30.700]
girl you got to get it

[01:55:30.700 --> 01:55:31.640]
you're a roller-lake of

[01:55:31.640 --> 01:55:33.580]
girl it's all you've got to do

[01:55:34.100 --> 01:55:35.440]
you're a roller-lake of

[01:55:35.440 --> 01:55:37.440]
girl you got to get it

[01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:39.860]
I said you'll never be mine

[01:55:40.440 --> 01:55:41.840]
come on, you're coming time

[01:55:42.440 --> 01:55:44.880]
I'm just on the love you've been hiding

[01:55:45.440 --> 01:55:47.600]
it's just a push you won't live

[01:55:48.440 --> 01:55:50.360]
I told you to come and give

[01:55:50.360 --> 01:55:52.340]
all my love you've been denied

[01:55:52.340 --> 01:55:56.180]
he's a roller-lake

[01:55:56.180 --> 01:55:57.160]
you're a roller-lake of

[01:55:57.160 --> 01:56:04.040]
girl you're a roller-lake

[01:56:04.040 --> 01:56:05.260]
you're a roller-lake of

[01:56:08.560 --> 01:56:09.060]
Oh

[01:56:09.060 --> 01:56:09.320]
Oh

[01:56:09.320 --> 01:56:10.120]
They love you

[01:56:10.800 --> 01:56:11.600]
They get you

[01:56:12.280 --> 01:56:13.320]
They love you

[01:56:13.320 --> 01:56:13.580]
They get you

[01:56:13.580 --> 01:56:14.420]
They love you

[01:56:14.420 --> 01:56:14.800]
They love you

[01:56:14.800 --> 01:56:14.980]
They love you

[01:56:14.980 --> 01:56:15.660]
They love you

[01:56:15.660 --> 01:56:16.920]
They love you

[01:56:16.920 --> 01:56:17.600]
They love you

[01:56:17.600 --> 01:56:18.220]
They love you

[01:56:18.220 --> 01:56:23.020]
They love you

[01:56:23.020 --> 01:56:25.160]
I want to wear it

[01:56:25.160 --> 01:56:26.480]
They love you

[01:56:26.480 --> 01:56:27.820]
They love to ride a bicycle

[01:56:27.820 --> 01:56:29.800]
They love to ride a bicycle

[01:56:29.800 --> 01:56:32.100]
But when we say

[01:56:33.020 --> 01:56:34.260]
It's actually a question

[01:56:34.260 --> 01:56:35.700]
Where are we going?

[01:56:35.900 --> 01:56:36.940]
Why the cliches?

[01:56:37.560 --> 01:56:38.000]
Why the cliches?

[01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:39.080]
Trying to find the place

[01:56:39.080 --> 01:56:39.880]
If than the next

[01:56:39.880 --> 01:56:41.580]
Let's roll it

[01:56:45.340 --> 01:56:47.520]
We'll be careful

[01:56:49.460 --> 01:56:51.180]
I'll go and carry on

[01:56:52.120 --> 01:56:53.000]
Kick me

[01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:56.920]
I'm gonna throw the gun and go ahead and see you with all the makeup

[01:56:56.920 --> 01:57:00.120]
Throw the gun and get justice, throw the gun and go

[01:57:00.120 --> 01:57:04.100]
Lay the gun and get the kid and come to the world

[01:57:04.100 --> 01:57:09.120]
Swear the things that will never you and be seen

[01:57:10.640 --> 01:57:12.200]
Things to do

[01:57:24.820 --> 01:57:25.760]
Things are tough now

[01:57:25.760 --> 01:57:27.800]
Actually I thought it was quite nice

[01:57:29.520 --> 01:57:32.440]
Oh God, 169 votes on the full G

[01:57:32.440 --> 01:57:33.900]
If we'd have pushed it we'd have had 1200

[01:57:33.900 --> 01:57:35.840]
But then again with all this music

[01:57:35.840 --> 01:57:38.280]
Which isn't nearly as entertaining as Wayne's press conference

[01:57:38.280 --> 01:57:40.120]
The honey tune yeah

[01:57:49.760 --> 01:57:52.700]
Spent two years learning California

[01:57:55.060 --> 01:57:58.660]
Standing in line clutching my jeans

[01:58:00.140 --> 01:58:04.800]
Open I didn't soap my underers

[01:58:04.800 --> 01:58:08.320]
Cause I knew my brother was so weird

[01:58:10.420 --> 01:58:14.720]
All that night I felt water retention

[01:58:15.320 --> 01:58:20.320]
I stood in line said things I'd rather not mention right now

[01:58:20.880 --> 01:58:24.420]
Just after midnight I looked up

[01:58:24.420 --> 01:58:27.600]
Saw the signs saying half a new year

[01:58:27.600 --> 01:58:30.460]
But we're closed now but I said

[01:58:30.460 --> 01:58:33.740]
I gotta be so bad

[01:58:33.740 --> 01:58:36.100]
But now we're giving a say

[01:58:36.740 --> 01:58:41.300]
To prevent myself from feeling my shoe

[01:58:41.300 --> 01:58:43.840]
So I gotta be so bad

[01:58:44.740 --> 01:58:46.460]
What do I do?

[01:58:47.320 --> 01:58:49.920]
What do I do?

[01:58:53.320 --> 01:58:55.680]
I told him say

[01:58:57.060 --> 01:58:59.000]
We're wonderful

[01:59:00.400 --> 01:59:03.140]
WQKL in Miami

[01:59:15.340 --> 01:59:21.140]
We did together sing the way back where

[01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:27.760]
Sometimes I never want to see you again

[01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:35.820]
But I want to know after all the years

[01:59:35.820 --> 01:59:42.340]
You're still the one I want to spend in Miami

[01:59:42.340 --> 01:59:46.560]
You're still the one going on to the stage

[01:59:46.560 --> 01:59:49.840]
You're the one that's in my head

[01:59:49.840 --> 01:59:53.940]
We're still coming home and you're still the one

[01:59:55.680 --> 02:00:00.740]
I know that you're being everyday

[02:00:02.280 --> 02:00:09.940]
You're my name so I do my way to you again

[02:00:11.720 --> 02:00:14.960]
I just wanted to go

[02:00:14.960 --> 02:00:16.960]
I wanted to go

[02:00:16.960 --> 02:00:16.960]

[02:00:22.960 --> 02:00:26.540]
I'm still the one that's in my head

[02:00:29.480 --> 02:00:31.360]
We're still wonderful

[02:00:31.360 --> 02:00:35.740]
And you're still the one you think is

[02:00:35.740 --> 02:00:39.380]
You're still the one that makes me proud

[02:00:39.380 --> 02:00:43.100]
You're still the one that's in my head

[02:00:43.100 --> 02:00:44.640]
We're still wonderful

[02:00:44.640 --> 02:00:48.260]
And you're still the one you think is

[02:01:15.480 --> 02:01:16.660]
You're still the one

[02:01:26.620 --> 02:01:29.680]
You're still the one going on to the stage

[02:01:31.300 --> 02:01:43.080]
You're still the one going on to the stage

[02:01:43.080 --> 02:01:45.820]
You're still the one who walks

[02:01:45.820 --> 02:01:48.980]
You're still the one and I can't get enough

[02:01:48.980 --> 02:01:53.080]
You're still the one and you're still the one

[02:01:55.040 --> 02:01:58.560]
You're still the one who gets scratched by me

[02:01:59.080 --> 02:02:01.440]
You're still the one that's in my head

[02:02:01.440 --> 02:02:07.320]
We're still wonderful and you're still the one

[02:02:07.320 --> 02:02:12.280]
You are still the one that makes me proud

[02:02:12.280 --> 02:02:15.540]
Still the one that makes me proud

[02:02:15.540 --> 02:02:19.680]
Cause you have one and still the one

[02:02:20.320 --> 02:02:27.320]
You have one and still the one

[02:02:28.860 --> 02:02:33.760]
We're still the one and still the one

[02:02:33.760 --> 02:02:37.320]
We're still the one and still the one

[02:02:39.840 --> 02:02:40.740]
We're still the one and still the one

[02:02:46.660 --> 02:02:50.360]
She came out of you yesterday

[02:02:58.100 --> 02:03:01.000]
Oh right, this is song in my heart

[02:03:02.500 --> 02:03:05.700]
And the chance to be yours forever

[02:03:05.700 --> 02:03:08.160]
I couldn't feel my secure

[02:03:09.660 --> 02:03:13.240]
I know I couldn't feel any better

[02:03:13.240 --> 02:03:16.800]
Oh Lord, ever knows

[02:03:16.800 --> 02:03:19.020]
Because I'm a child of you

[02:03:19.020 --> 02:03:20.560]
I'm a child of you

[02:03:20.560 --> 02:03:21.280]
I'm a child of you

[02:03:21.280 --> 02:03:23.080]
I'm a child of you

[02:03:23.080 --> 02:03:31.220]
Every time we're together

[02:03:32.400 --> 02:03:34.840]
We're still moving like lightning

[02:03:34.840 --> 02:03:36.240]
To me

[02:03:36.800 --> 02:03:38.720]
I thought you beautiful feeling

[02:03:39.940 --> 02:03:41.560]
You never hear it

[02:03:41.560 --> 02:03:43.360]
If I said to you

[02:03:43.360 --> 02:03:50.620]
Oh Lord, ever know, how much I love you, how much it shows.

[02:03:51.500 --> 02:03:55.940]
Oh Lord, ever, ever knows.

[02:03:59.360 --> 02:04:04.780]
I was never without you, trying to make it a love.

[02:04:04.780 --> 02:04:09.040]
Oh Lord, ever know, what there's nothing about you.

[02:04:10.440 --> 02:04:16.400]
Now your heart is my heart, if it's all in my heart.

[02:04:17.820 --> 02:04:23.620]
And the chance to be your scarlet love, couldn't feel more secure.

[02:04:25.460 --> 02:04:32.080]
I know I couldn't feel any effect of, oh Lord, ever know.

[02:04:33.100 --> 02:04:36.020]
Oh Lord, ever know, how much I love you, how much it shows.

[02:04:36.620 --> 02:04:41.540]
Oh Lord, ever, ever knows.

[02:04:47.680 --> 02:04:54.920]
Oh Lord, ever know, how much I love you, how much it shows.

[02:04:55.600 --> 02:05:02.060]
Oh Lord, ever, ever know, what there's nothing about you.

[02:05:02.060 --> 02:05:06.540]
Oh Lord, ever know, how much I love you, how much I love you, how much I love you, how much I love you.
