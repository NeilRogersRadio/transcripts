[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.260]
Thanks for the beeswax now.

[00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:01.600]
BAH!

[00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.180]
Ain't no farts sounds anymore.

[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.320]
Ain't no farts sounds like before.

[00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:17.320]
No.

[00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.800]
Ain't no farts sounds anymore.

[00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.740]
For some stinky corporate home.

[00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.360]
Name joys took them away.

[00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.580]
Can't say f***ing out.

[00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.740]
I'll bake cause of some bitch cow.

[00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.060]
Just to bring the ratings down.

[00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:48.420]
She don't want Neil around

[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.840]
And that's why she took them away.

[00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:59.680]
And she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow.

[00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:28.800]
Blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow

[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:35.080]
she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blows, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, laughs

[00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:44.100]
也是 inspecting a hole, I like it

[00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:58.780]
Dainky, Urgent, Irgendwa Incor�, did you see that?

[00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:05.360]
And in case the beastly had missed it the first 80 million times, there's another one for him and here's another one of these too.

[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.480]
No extra charge. I don't care what you see. I think mine's got something going for it.

[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.000]
Oh, there's nothing better than the other one, but I think it's got like some enthusiasm behind it.

[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.860]
There's nothing like having a little enthusiasm in your behind, but at any rate.

[00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:27.260]
Oh, look at this. The Detroit City Council led by Monica Conyer's wife of representative John Conyer's Democrat Amishigan.

[00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:34.820]
Yesterday, unanimously passed a resolution calling for the impeachment of President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney by the U.S. House of Representatives.

[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:42.260]
Detroit joins a growing list of cities in the state of Vermont, which are passed resolutions urging the impeachment of El Presidente and El Vice Presidente.

[00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.440]
All right, that's all we can say to that.

[00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.900]
Oh, right.

[00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:52.700]
All right, let's say before we go into a big rant about the beastlies refusing to play chicken, they just don't pay their bills.

[00:02:52.700 --> 00:03:00.860]
They do whatever they want. These are people listed on the stock exchange who can't represent to the public that they run a responsible company and they don't.

[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.200]
They don't pay their freaking bills.

[00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.140]
And this man is missing his mortgage payment and stuff because of the fact that they're not paying.

[00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.300]
And here's a guy, probably the most creative person in radio in America today, right?

[00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.920]
A bit we just played there for the first of four million times today.

[00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.240]
Funny as hell is imported. This show is imported. This radio station and they don't want a penny.

[00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.160]
But you were probably cracking up at that line right there important to the radio station.

[00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.440]
No, no, I'm talking about from a real perspective. I'm talking about the way the little thing goes.

[00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:30.280]
We know this perspective.

[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:36.440]
Not to them. Not to them. He's a pain in the ass to them because I expect to get paid just like you and Chris, right?

[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.640]

[00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:42.920]
And of course me, I mean, that goes without saying, oh, we're going to all the money we're paying him. Why should we pay these other people?

[00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.260]
Yeah, because that's the deal. That's the way it works.

[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.280]
And it's a bit of a way it's been working for nine and a half years.

[00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:54.880]
And it's like anybody else when it's time when somebody sends you an invoice to get paid, you pay it. That's the way people do business.

[00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.160]
When FPNL sends you the electric bill, you don't say, oh, gee, I don't think I'm going to pay it for a few months.

[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:05.100]
Because then I'm going to come and shut your electric off, okay? Just like that vacuum cleaner salesman.

[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:07.600]
God almighty.

[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.960]
How is it possibly be such a bunch of professional deadbeats?

[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:16.180]
You ought to go in here and tell Georgia Beasley that she needs to recall him up and tell him that the Boca Brian is getting screwed over.

[00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:17.800]
Yeah, we've got a lot of people on here.

[00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:19.160]
Yeah, tell her, pull this.

[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.800]
It may not be a bokehful teller. Not that.

[00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:30.660]
I'm serious. It's just I'm sitting there with my assistant. Broke even by the way for those people worried about my very, very serious gambling problem.

[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:36.820]
I broke even yesterday after winning your grand on Tuesday. So for the week, I'm doing just fine. I was playing with their money yesterday as well.

[00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.180]
I looked at it and I did just fine.

[00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.480]
Anytime you're gambling and you break even, you feel like you're one of billion dollars. You know that?

[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:44.500]
That's true. Yeah.

[00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.560]
Well, you wouldn't know it because you don't have any money to gamble.

[00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.080]
It's just as well because the worst thing you could do is get involved in a bad gambling problem.

[00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:55.940]
In fact, if you came on the year and said, oh, I went to Vegas and I, you know, won $2,500 bucks or something like that.

[00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:01.320]
Audiences start giving you crap. Oh, Georgia's got a gambling problem just like the old man and like that crap.

[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.240]
You know, all these Yantes out there, the South Florida Yantes who can't mind their own business.

[00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:09.000]
And if you did one, $2,500, give it to Bokeh Brown. Give it to Chick-N-Eck because he needs it.

[00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:15.680]
I'm not giving him any more money. Christ almighty. I spread it around Mania. Have some people spread manure. That's how I spread my money.

[00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.640]
Everybody gets a piece. Everybody gets a chunk.

[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:25.700]
But he's he's getting the big chunk from my old ass and they need to start paying his bills. That's all.

[00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:29.600]
When you get the invoices, write a check. That's a clarify to be doing something about it.

[00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:34.460]
See, Pop had the jenko look what we got. That's where I look at it.

[00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:39.940]
He makes Duff look like a rocket scientist. That's what we got with clearance there.

[00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:47.080]
We need, I remember on IOD saying we need a program director who's an advocate for the talent who goes to bat for the shows.

[00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:51.740]
Not who's just a sports nerd who pretends that he's like a UN law sportscaster or something like that.

[00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:55.480]
Go to WVUM and work their clearance if you want to be a UN sportscaster.

[00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:01.560]
If you want to be a program director start being an advocate for the talent. Go to bat for us and for our people.

[00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:03.440]
For our people's idiot.

[00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:11.020]
How come you're not in there screaming at clearance and screaming at me? How come that's it? How come Bokeh Brown ain't getting paid?

[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:16.520]
And that's why Bokeh said in that ridiculous email about charging 50,000 bucks a bit or whatever.

[00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.800]
I mean, that was just stupid. I didn't even read it and I said, okay, do whatever you want to.

[00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:23.640]
He now he says, oh, I got Neil Seal of approval. Yes, Seal this, chicken egg.

[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:28.280]
God, they're watching too many old quiz show reruns. That's his problem.

[00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:35.220]
Three U.S. soldiers started in the grizzly kidnapping murder plots south of Baghdad last June. We're not properly protected.

[00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:41.400]
During a mission that was poorly planned or executed, the military investigations conclude. I like that word planned or executed.

[00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:46.040]
Two military officers have been relieved of their command as a result of the litany of mistakes,

[00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:51.100]
but neither faces criminal charges. A military official familiar with the investigation told the A&PS today.

[00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:55.540]
A reporter in the investigation said they platoon leader and company commander, whose names did not release,

[00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:59.360]
failed to provide proper supervision of the unit or enforce military standards.

[00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:06.800]
A seven-page summary of the investigation provided the AP said it also appears in surgeons' may have rehearsed the attack two days earlier,

[00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:15.040]
and that Iraqi security forces near the soldiers on post probably saw and heard the attack and chose to not become an active participant in the attack on either side.

[00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:21.800]
Three hundred and first airborne division soldiers were killed June 16, 2006.

[00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:27.080]
The mutilated bodies were found three days later tied together and booby trapped with bombs.

[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:34.800]
And it goes on, the Biko's on, we got over 3,400 American soldiers, we've got hundreds of thousands of dead Iraqis,

[00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:41.420]
and the public wants to know what time is dancing with the stars on. Who's going to get kicked off American Idol?

[00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:48.580]
Oh my god, almighty, give me a break. When you watch like Wheeler Torscher for example, or any quiz show,

[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:54.120]
and you see how many stupid Americans there are, and there's a puzzle up there that's got like basically every letter in it except one.

[00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:59.780]
There was some binbo on a couple of nights ago, and that was the case. There was every letter except one.

[00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:08.280]
How about an ex? Is there an exonet there? No, I don't think so. Pat looks at her like, Jesus, God, are you some dumb stupid bitch?

[00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:14.180]
And ugly beside you. And she was both. I mean there's so many stupid people in so little time, but they don't.

[00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:19.060]
We don't care about dead people, they're just statistics, okay? They're just numbers on a sheet of paper,

[00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:24.140]
and the media's got important things to worry about like, and Nicole who's the real father and yadi-adi-adi.

[00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:29.720]
And Pericilton is only serving half of the, I will get to that, it's in my pile, I got a big, fat, juicy pile.

[00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:35.300]
For a, by the way, yes? I said great. Oh, I thought you were saying Clarence's skim in it, and he's going to take care of it.

[00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:42.140]
You were right. What? No, sir, if you were really friends with Chick-Nec, you'd go in there right now, and you'd go to bad form,

[00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:47.400]
and you'd say, hey, listen, you little, we's a lot, you, you, you, you BDI little, I would go to bad form.

[00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:54.240]
They laughed at me slightly less than they laughed at him. Yeah, well, so slightly less, or at least you got a chance.

[00:08:54.880 --> 00:09:01.760]
Right, you're paying, right? Not much. Right. That's what I'd be doing right now. I'd be hopping up and down on his desk like Rumpelstool's bread.

[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:07.400]
I would drop my pants and drop a big roll right there, and somebody that they don't even want inside the building, you know, a lot of pull.

[00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:19.760]
He'd let you pull. Oh, jeez. Oh, it's good. Now, you know, I felt that he came in and he was like, are we adjusting his goods that day? Oh, man, I wanted to, if there were

[00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:28.200]
there'd been an injection button that day, I would just, just, just flown out of there. I have seldom in my life seen anything so grotesque.

[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:37.360]
1517, those I should have filed like a sex discrimination suit that day. I think that was intended to arouse my old ass and believe me, it aroused me to do one thing.

[00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:44.060]
I wanted to get that out of there. In fact, I think that's one of the reasons I don't want to do any shows and there anymore for food. I have to say repeat performance of that.

[00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:52.540]
I think what he was doing was like a one man search party. Or maybe what he was doing was like what Brady Quinn is doing in that picture. Now, what were you telling me?

[00:09:52.540 --> 00:10:01.480]
That's the gay leather outfit. It looks like a wedding and obviously they were dressed up like the village people or something like that because I see one of the guys next to him is looking like the cop.

[00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:10.460]
Right. And everything. And it's the thing that people have a little bit gay to me. Yeah. A lot of rumors about Brady Quinn being gay. And I sure hope they're true. I'll tell you that.

[00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:20.520]
Not that I'm referring to be anywhere near, but yeah, it's just that it gives some of us a little bit of hope that we somebody could grow. It seems to be a lot of growth and going on with him. Most of it by

[00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:30.500]
himself. Here's the poll from yesterday. My doctor told me I had 30 days left to live. I would do this. And then we already gave this result because we ended it during the show and put the new one on there because we

[00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:38.060]
eclipsed 1500 votes yesterday. Oh, how they knew you got are we popular? Are we good? Yes. Have to keep saying that because then it sounds like we believe it.

[00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:48.900]
But we know the good part. We just don't know about the popular anyway. We're on this station who don't even want to play Bokeh Brian. His from March. This is the middle of May. Here's a guy that's got bills who's living from hand to mouth.

[00:10:49.460 --> 00:11:10.900]
Who had a cell is here to survive. Obviously didn't get much for it. Not too much. If my doctor told me I had 30 days left to live, I'd see the world 439 votes. Have as much sex as seemingly possible. 327. Oh, yeah. Now we're talking starting right now. I'm going to be busy the rest of the show. You handle it. Right. I will get my affairs in order 235.

[00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:21.960]
Hunt up Joyce and kick her in the balls. 182. Spend my life savings on eating and parting 148. If I only had 30 days to live, it would be just one non-party.

[00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:39.320]
Yeah. Right. Almost of course I was ill in which case I think about having a non-stop party. Get drunk and stay drunk 69. I wouldn't do anything. 33 boring, boring people. Oh, brother. Just sit around and vegetate. Wait for that moment. How? How thrilling.

[00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:50.800]
Become real religious real fast 28. Looks very far. Well, sure did him a lot of good. He's still dead by the way. All right. I got a lot of nasty stories and articles and columns about him today. And I can't wait to dig into him.

[00:11:51.400 --> 00:12:03.280]
If I have 30 days left to live, I'd make amends with those I've wrong. 28 people. And we'd like to know who you've wronged out there. 28. And what kind of bastards you are. We'd like to come and hunt your ass down with a shotgun. Then you can make amends.

[00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:12.820]
Crawling to bed and stay there at 10 and ended all right now eight. I wouldn't mind crawling in bed and staying there all depending on who I was in there with. That's that's the important part of that choice.

[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:23.060]
We got over 1100 votes on today's pool already and our goal of course is a thousand. When it comes to a container, it makes real ruckus, real ruckus. Yeah, but you cheated.

[00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:28.240]
Who's really a five 16? I got your breasts are beautiful.

[00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:30.700]
Oh my god. I'm going to the prom. What's it up?

[00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:36.620]
It does something different with your hair since the first time you've found my track in Wax-Cyone Ira and took them both clean off.

[00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:42.120]
Someone has to. I can't simply need a date to the prom. Still stinking a rare sight from the prom.

[00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:46.680]
Well, she's looking like a star and she's cruising to the high school prom now.

[00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:52.520]
Your prom date is a hooker. But since she stole some liquor from her days, Gavin Edden, she's found her.

[00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:54.460]
Yeah. How many wine is your dream?

[00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:58.780]
I'm with her dating the car. She's with her legs. Just as fast as she can now.

[00:12:59.020 --> 00:12:59.440]
Oh my god.

[00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:04.120]
And she'll have fun, fun, fun, till her daddy finds up she got mad.

[00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:06.760]
I'm on, on, ill her daddy finds up she got mad.

[00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:10.560]
Well, instead of the prom, they both decide to get in the back seat now.

[00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:12.280]
I got sex right here.

[00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:16.920]
And her date kinda lags to push her's wearing and easily removed gown.

[00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:23.240]
And when he's had his way the next day, her name will be all over her desk.

[00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:24.100]
What's or not?

[00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:28.440]
And she'll have fun, fun, fun, till her daddy finds up she got mad.

[00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:31.400]
I'm on, on, ill her daddy finds up she got mad.

[00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:35.020]
So, I've lodged with my whole heart since the night of my high school.

[00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:35.940]
What are you doing now, Ron?

[00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:38.900]
When you find out your daughter got late in the senior prom night.

[00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:41.940]
Good shot, Gun. I got it.

[00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:42.620]
Oh.

[00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:45.240]
1115 votes on today's pool.

[00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:48.540]
Well, I'll tell you, we are, well, it's because we started yesterday right in the middle of the show

[00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:49.480]
because I was off to Woodland.

[00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:53.060]
I wanna, I wanna have to lay that responsibility on your, uh, narrow shoulders.

[00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:56.480]
And you ought to be really, I'm sure you were relieved.

[00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:58.640]
You didn't have to worry about, oh gee, I gotta change the pool.

[00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:00.480]
Cause it's such a big chore, you know.

[00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:03.080]
You gotta click that button and take at least half a second.

[00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:05.880]
But, you know, it's more fun to start it during the show, the new pool.

[00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:06.500]
Ain't it?

[00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:08.000]
Oh, I'm sorry, Brandon.

[00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:09.920]
I did not go and get cash. She was in peria.

[00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:13.660]
Last night I was messaging with my close personal internet buddy Brandon.

[00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:16.300]
He, you know, I was talking about going and getting some crap.

[00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:17.980]
And he talked me out of that.

[00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:19.560]
All the way, did you get a piece of carrot cake?

[00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:20.480]
Is that bad?

[00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:21.400]
It's not good.

[00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:21.880]
Not bad.

[00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:25.080]
Could be worse, I didn't get the cash who was in peria like he suggested.

[00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:28.120]
But nevertheless, hey listen, I'm doing the best I can.

[00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:32.920]
But between Cisco and Brandon, they got the whoops and chains out trying to beat me into shape

[00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:33.760]
and keep me alive.

[00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:36.280]
See, these are people who care about me, George.

[00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:36.940]
Yeah.

[00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:41.980]
I don't care how much money you leave me.

[00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:43.400]
You're still worth more live than dead.

[00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:46.020]
Well, I also told George, I'm leaving some money in my will.

[00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:48.440]
I told him how much this morning, which I thought it was a fairly decent amount.

[00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:49.160]
Or it's just sweet, whatever.

[00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:50.740]
It's more than I expected or well.

[00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:54.300]
And also, yeah, I got to five people laid out who are going to be in that will.

[00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:54.920]
And that's it.

[00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:55.800]
It's closed.

[00:14:57.780 --> 00:14:58.520]
It's all closed.

[00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:01.880]
No matter who comes up here, no matter how much the sex they offer, it's just that.

[00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:02.460]
That's the only way.

[00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:05.400]
Well, it has to be simply different from...

[00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:07.220]
Oh, what if they offer a big bucket of love?

[00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:08.240]
Holy Moses.

[00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:11.540]
1160 votes on the pool.

[00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:14.800]
See, there he goes again, Neil and George, with these inside jokes.

[00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:16.060]
We want to know what it's all about.

[00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:17.660]
Yeah, business but out.

[00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:18.680]
But out.

[00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:19.760]
Idiots.

[00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:21.340]
I'm the Daniel Crofts.

[00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:22.460]
What will be your response?

[00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:24.060]
1160 votes already.

[00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:27.320]
We are kicking big fat, pimpley, smelly ass, baby.

[00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:30.020]
He died doing what he wanted to do with 330.

[00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:32.720]
I'm sure I'll buy died doing whom I want to do.

[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:33.660]
Oh, man.

[00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:34.400]
Woo!

[00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:37.800]
He was a lovely human being, blah, blah, blah.

[00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:38.520]
Who's in the will?

[00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:39.320]
242.

[00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:40.100]
Well, guess what?

[00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:40.760]
Not you.

[00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:45.680]
He's in that big radio station in the sky, 166.

[00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:48.580]
He's making on Jesus right now, 110.

[00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:49.540]
Are you sure?

[00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:52.460]
He died a free man, no wife, 92.

[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:53.980]
He was adorable, 87.

[00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:55.300]
I'm adorable.

[00:15:56.420 --> 00:15:59.460]
That's why I have so many offers of sexual favors, because I'm so adorable.

[00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:02.400]
And you know how I turn them down, too.

[00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:05.680]
He was a right, because, see, that's the problem in life.

[00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:09.060]
You get offers of sexual favors from people you wouldn't touch with somebody else's hand.

[00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:10.220]
For whatever reason.

[00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:12.180]
I have to do all of this except for Chris, I think.

[00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:13.920]
Well, Chris is doing fine.

[00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:14.940]
And we're very proud of him.

[00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:15.200]
Yes, he is.

[00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:15.980]
Yes, we are.

[00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:18.900]
We're very proud to keep it quiet, though, just like Q&A.

[00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:19.780]
Keep it a secret.

[00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:20.700]
Shh.

[00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:21.240]
That's right.

[00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:23.220]
He was adorable, 88.

[00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:23.880]
I'm adorable.

[00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:25.880]
If you like fat, sloppy, old queens.

[00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:28.800]
He was a rotten bastard, good riddance, 63.

[00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:33.400]
5.6% of the entire audience say I'm a rotten bastard, good riddance, good riddance, good

[00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:33.980]
croak.

[00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:35.300]
That's very nice.

[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:36.480]
That's really nice.

[00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:39.820]
And I know he's up there looking down at us 28.

[00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:42.820]
I'll be 26 out of 1122 vote.

[00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:47.700]
5.6% of the audience think I'm a rotten bastard, I should only croak.

[00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:49.900]
And good riddance, isn't that sweet?

[00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:52.240]
That's just, you know, the South Florida thing.

[00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:54.980]
That's one of the reasons it's so great not to be there.

[00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:59.980]
It's quite an item that guy at that LLP place in Philadelphia was the right meal today.

[00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:01.360]
That's for him too, Adam.

[00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:02.100]
That's not an important.

[00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:05.760]
Up yours, give me a lecture and at me time he's in Philadelphia.

[00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:09.400]
Like a real city with real love people and like real food, man.

[00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:10.500]
Like I could food in Philly.

[00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:15.300]
And I'm not going to talk about those Philly cheese steaks and sandwiches and fattening stuff like that.

[00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:17.000]
What?

[00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:18.360]
Philadelphia cheese steaks?

[00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:19.660]
Philadelphia cheese steaks.

[00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:24.960]
Anyway, here's 1124 is what we got on the poll and I'm pretty proud of that since it's an old

[00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:26.240]
only one 1022.

[00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:27.240]
I'm not too happy about that.

[00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:28.480]
Here's a schedule for today.

[00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:30.580]
I'm WDQAM.

[00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:31.740]
Keep it secret.

[00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:34.800]
Now did Clarence come in here and say we're going to take care of that Volker brand?

[00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:37.000]
You want to go into accounting right now.

[00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:38.740]
All right.

[00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:40.020]
I'm serious.

[00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:40.840]
Take take a rope.

[00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:43.540]
And you're going to take that rope and put it around somebody's neck.

[00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:45.020]
I don't want to say who's back there.

[00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:48.000]
I don't want to get them upset with me because they take all of me.

[00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:48.580]
There you go.

[00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:52.880]
But while we are, let's see if my permission to go back there and take that rope and tie on knot.

[00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:54.460]
Can you tie like a hangman's noose?

[00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:55.640]
I can tie any knot you can name.

[00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:56.780]
Well, tie a hangman's noose.

[00:17:56.780 --> 00:17:57.720]
Including a hangman's noose.

[00:17:57.740 --> 00:17:57.860]
Yes.

[00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:01.720]
And put it around her a heed whoever's back there accounting saying, hey listen, chicken act

[00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:04.660]
Volker brand, he ain't getting paid and this is going to go right around your heed.

[00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:06.060]
Unless you're going to take care of that.

[00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:08.080]
I love them.

[00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:09.360]
She takes good care of me.

[00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:13.860]
But I'll never lessen and you know, look, see you're making excuses why not to do this.

[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.220]
I'm going to go to the refrigerator.

[00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:19.200]
No matter how much she takes of me, I want him off my back is the main thing.

[00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:20.420]
Get him taken care of.

[00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:20.920]
You got it.

[00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:22.800]
You're not going to do it.

[00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:25.300]
I'll go over there and do the break and they'll ignore me.

[00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:26.300]
They'll laugh at me.

[00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:29.640]
They'll sit there and nod and pretend to give a crap and then as soon as I leave the office

[00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:30.220]
they'll laugh.

[00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:33.080]
Well, at least give it a shot.

[00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:34.480]
I'll give it the old college try.

[00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:34.980]
Right.

[00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:39.160]
So at least he's the right fact to chicken act and say who we're trying like crazy.

[00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:40.280]
He can hear it right now.

[00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:40.780]
He's listening.

[00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:42.980]
I'm trying for you, chicken act.

[00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:45.400]
Volody, I'm trying to the best I can.

[00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:47.260]
Hey, grow a little more hair man.

[00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:48.200]
See if he can sell it.

[00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:49.200]
He can't grow anymore here.

[00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:50.600]
Not anything.

[00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:53.740]
Maybe what I can do is you know the hair I shave off every couple of days.

[00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:55.500]
I gave him a whole tour of maybe three or four days.

[00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:58.900]
I'll just put it in a big sack and see if I can sell it and send him the proceeds.

[00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:01.640]
Anybody want to buy some hair?

[00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:03.640]
Yeah, a hairy sack.

[00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:09.980]
Former Senator Mike Grovel, the Longshot Presidential candidate who's generated buzz in the

[00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:13.640]
liberal blogosphere following a dramatic and heated performance during the first

[00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:18.080]
Democratic presidential debate, reaffirmed his belief that President Bush should be jailed

[00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:21.480]
for going to war in Iraq and that all drugs should be legalized during interview with the

[00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:22.580]
Iowa Independent Blog.

[00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:23.280]
You go, Mike.

[00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:26.540]
Here's a man with a brain and a big mouth and a ball to say the way it is.

[00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:32.260]
At a boy responding to why he seemed to display anger at the debate Grovel asserted it was the growing casual

[00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:34.380]
leave us in Iraq that fueled his passion.

[00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:38.780]
How would you feel if you were over there in Iraq getting shot at, getting crippled because your

[00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:40.980]
leaders didn't exercise proper judgment, Grovel asked.

[00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:43.960]
What about the people who are going to die between now and Christmas because we're

[00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:44.440]
going to be known in the war?

[00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:45.500]
That's a reason to get angry.

[00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:47.060]
Amen, brother.

[00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:51.500]
Grovel went on to reaffirm support for a signature campaign issue, a national initiative

[00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:55.860]
process, as well as support for national sales tax, they traditionally conservative position.

[00:19:57.080 --> 00:19:58.500]
But you like to say that position?

[00:19:58.760 --> 00:19:58.980]
Seat.

[00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:00.360]
That's what your people say.

[00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:01.480]
Position like New Jersey.

[00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:03.840]
I don't know why they say like that, but they say it.

[00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:07.500]
When asked whether he believed Merrill Wanners should be available next to beer and liquor

[00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:11.580]
stores, Grovel replied, go get yourself a fifth of Scotch or a fifth of dinner and chug a

[00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:14.880]
dog at down and you'll find your lose your senses a lot faster than you would smoking

[00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:15.760]
Samarro Wanners.

[00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:18.300]
He asserted that all drugs should be legalized and regulated.

[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:21.240]
The drug problems of public health problems are not a criminal problem.

[00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:24.480]
We make it a criminal problem because we treat people like criminals.

[00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:26.080]
This man makes two damn life sense.

[00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:27.880]
They better take his ass away with that news.

[00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:32.400]
Grovel continued to take a drug addict to throw him in jail, leaving there and he learns

[00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:34.640]
the criminal traits of them when he gets out and he has recidivism.

[00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:38.320]
When pressed on his earlier statement that President Bush should be jailed for his manipulation

[00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:40.760]
of pre-war information, Grovel reaffirmed that belief.

[00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:45.180]
If you had an FBI agent mock at you during the day in lie, you lied to that agent, you

[00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:48.660]
commit a felony and you go to jail, he said, if that's the way this ordinary citizen is

[00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:52.180]
what about the President of the US who lies to the American people, fraudulently sells him

[00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:56.040]
on a war that 50 million Americans don't want and gets over 3,000 Americans killed as a

[00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:58.560]
result of that and thousands and thousands of Iraqis get killed.

[00:20:58.840 --> 00:20:59.860]
Don't you think that's a felony?

[00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:00.800]
It's criminal, he said.

[00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:01.840]
And I would say he is.

[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.220]
Absolutely correct.

[00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:04.660]
What am I getting excited about?

[00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:05.860]
Because nobody gives a crap anyway.

[00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:07.000]
Nobody gives a rat's ass.

[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.940]
They're dying like flies over there.

[00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:13.420]
3,400 Americans soldiers based on a war on lies and we're worried about a stain on a

[00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:14.320]
freaking blue dress.

[00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:15.980]
Welcome to a campaign.

[00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:19.520]
That's a boy side who's been with me too.

[00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:21.760]
Who's pretty old 515?

[00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:22.860]
She's right here.

[00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:28.260]
Wow, ever since we got grandpa that new iPod, he's really been getting down.

[00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:29.740]
I know, look at those moves.

[00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:31.740]
My taste maker stopped working.

[00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:32.320]
What?

[00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:32.840]
Paste?

[00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:34.680]
Yeah, you're setting the pace all right.

[00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:35.460]
You go grandpa.

[00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:39.480]
New studies suggest that Apple iPods may interfere with hard paste makers.

[00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:43.800]
So the next time you think you see your grandpa or grandma boogieing down while listening

[00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:48.000]
to an iPod, make sure it's the snappy music and not a failing paste maker.

[00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:49.420]
Look, he's break dancing.

[00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:51.960]
1031 at 560.

[00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:53.380]
Give pops a break, were you?

[00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:53.860]
Dance.

[00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:56.160]
A lot of 148 votes on the pool.

[00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:58.640]
I bet you by the top of the hour we're going to be around 1200 already.

[00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:00.300]
Chris Chris is mighty impressed with us.

[00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:02.980]
He's opening up a new page and his loose leaf little booklet there.

[00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:03.480]
Oh yeah.

[00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:04.720]
Can you go into accounting during the break?

[00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:08.420]
I went and talked to Clarence and he said, yes I did.

[00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:14.200]
And he sent an email to the business office yesterday about the issue because of, you know,

[00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:15.240]
he got Bogey Brian's email.

[00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:18.020]
Right, and probably went ahead and he had a close sweat.

[00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:19.300]
Yes, he's waiting for their response.

[00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:22.300]
He's waiting for their response.

[00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:27.240]
You know, in all comedy, all radio on air comedy aside, you know, because we've talked

[00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:30.360]
about it before the show that there's only one person that has any chance of getting them

[00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:33.120]
to change their behavior or do anything at all.

[00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:33.700]
And that's you.

[00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:36.720]
Well, what do you think I'm screaming about here today?

[00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:37.240]
Well, there you go.

[00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:38.300]
So I can jump on my down on.

[00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:41.700]
I'm as many desks as I've already said in my machine and woodbine.

[00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:46.460]
Trying to find a good machine and have my blackberry bees and then look at it and here's

[00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:47.940]
an email from chicken next to him.

[00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:52.280]
Oh, they haven't paid me since March and I'm going to get evicted from all this other

[00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:52.540]
stuff.

[00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:55.800]
And I could do a sock puppet show on Joe Bell's desk and it wouldn't change a thing.

[00:22:56.340 --> 00:23:00.080]
I think you ought to go and do a sock puppet show on Joe Bell's desk and then take your pants

[00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:01.400]
down and drop a load there too.

[00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:01.680]

[00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:03.780]
In fact, go start eating like crazy now.

[00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:04.160]
I am.

[00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:06.340]
I mean, go get some of that ice cream with sorbetol.

[00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:07.400]
Oh, sugar free.

[00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:07.960]
Oh.

[00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:11.680]
And then just drop gigantic loads on several desks in that play of it.

[00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:13.200]
And it'll get out of your system.

[00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:14.260]
It's right.

[00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:14.720]
It's right.

[00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:16.080]
It may not get anything else done.

[00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:18.320]
He sent an email.

[00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:20.340]
You tell that little weasel in there.

[00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:21.460]
At least he's trying anyway.

[00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:22.040]
You know, clearance.

[00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:23.540]
We like him every now and then.

[00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:24.080]
Not too much.

[00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:26.560]
No, he at least he's making an effort, we think.

[00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:28.080]
Maybe he's just lying about that.

[00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:28.740]
He has money.

[00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:30.360]
Yeah, that's right.

[00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:31.640]
What does he care for crying out loud?

[00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:33.080]
He probably has a budget to maintain.

[00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:34.180]
You know, you know, he don't have a clearance.

[00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:39.140]
Well, if we didn't have to give that fat, fat, all that money, you know, just keep the

[00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:39.580]
money coming.

[00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:40.340]
I told him.

[00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:42.280]
I don't want to start threatening or anything like that.

[00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:43.820]
In fact, next Friday is payday.

[00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:45.120]
A week from tomorrow's payday.

[00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:46.520]
Keep the money coming.

[00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:50.780]
In fact, wouldn't surprise me if that check shows up there next Thursday because they've

[00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:53.320]
been paying me a day early, but they just don't want to pay chicken at all.

[00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:53.680]
Right.

[00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:54.360]
They don't pay him early.

[00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:55.060]
They don't pay him late.

[00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:56.520]
They just don't pay him.

[00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:58.620]
And I'm not going to sit still for it.

[00:23:58.700 --> 00:23:59.620]
I might do the whole show on that.

[00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:03.260]
I might just scream and holler and carry on and give them a whole bunch of Florida Bronx

[00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:05.500]
tears and just keep it in the fact.

[00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:05.960]
They suck.

[00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:07.420]
I mean, here's a guy.

[00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:08.140]
This Joe Bell.

[00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:11.140]
His big thing is, oh, we're going to make this company money on this station now.

[00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:12.540]
They've been losing money with his sports stuff.

[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.640]
So we got a million spots on here.

[00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:16.300]
In fact, way too many on some shows.

[00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:17.180]
Way too many.

[00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:17.860]
But anyway.

[00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:19.980]
And that's his claim to fame.

[00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:22.780]
Well, that's fine if you're making it money, but how come they don't want to pay their

[00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:23.080]
bills?

[00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:26.120]
I'm not talking about spending money to promote God for bitter things like that.

[00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:30.160]
Oh, I mean, what's more important than that is sending out the big O to the combine,

[00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:34.900]
the NFL combine, or sending a bunch of goofballs out there on the, what do they call that thing

[00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:39.360]
when we were talking about it before the show and that morning show and talking to Chris

[00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:39.980]
about it, I'm sure.

[00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:42.980]
No, to you about it about that Ron Hershey thing.

[00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:44.380]
They sent him all the training camp.

[00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:45.340]
Oh, that's right.

[00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:47.640]
What did they call that thing?

[00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:48.580]
They had a name for it.

[00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:50.920]
I forgot.

[00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:54.460]
They had some kind of like a seminar and they sent all these guys down to California.

[00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:55.180]
They were in the show.

[00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:55.560]
They were in the show.

[00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:56.380]
They were in the show.

[00:24:56.460 --> 00:24:57.180]
Did it work?

[00:24:57.360 --> 00:24:57.480]
No.

[00:24:57.540 --> 00:24:58.680]
Is that show still on the air?

[00:24:58.760 --> 00:24:59.900]
Did they get a number with it?

[00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:00.080]
No.

[00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:00.200]
No.

[00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:02.280]
No, then what we got now, I'll say that, but that's not saying much.

[00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:07.600]
And so they spent, they spend money on crap like it's coming out of a faucet.

[00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:10.460]
Like people flush water down the toilet.

[00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:12.260]
That's the way they spend money on crap.

[00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:15.760]
If it has anything to do with sports, hey, the sky's the limit, baby.

[00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:17.260]
That's right.

[00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:21.360]
But when it comes to people who are working their ass off, let's see, here's Phil and

[00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:24.400]
Bridgeport Connecticut says, enough of the mother's day in dolphin promo.

[00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:28.820]
I'm ranking my headphones off so many times my effing ears are bleeding.

[00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:32.060]
Hey, you know, here's another guy, belly aching about the crap that they've got on the

[00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:32.800]
streaming thing.

[00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:37.320]
Like we have some control, better something to do with it.

[00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:41.340]
See, I don't want people to fill in Bridgeport Connecticut or anybody else belly aching.

[00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:44.580]
We got enough belly aches and stuff for it, okay?

[00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:45.740]
I don't need no belly aches.

[00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:46.900]
Yeah.

[00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:49.080]
All we get all the time is.

[00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:50.000]
Yeah.

[00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:51.600]
Oh, the internet's not in fact.

[00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:52.780]
I see the green light is up there.

[00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:54.880]
We've had no dropouts so far today anyway.

[00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:58.120]
I think we've got several dropouts working in management there.

[00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:00.860]
It just isn't the way business is done.

[00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:03.520]
Somebody gives you a, it's like responsible individuals.

[00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:04.320]
Forget about business.

[00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:05.660]
You get bills at the house.

[00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:07.080]
If you got the money, you pay the bills.

[00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:07.580]
That's all.

[00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:08.500]
You're right out of check.

[00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:10.260]
If you got the money.

[00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:13.160]
In my house, the day the bills show up, that's the day the checks get written and they

[00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:13.800]
get put in the mail.

[00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:14.860]
That's just the way it is.

[00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:16.380]
That's the way you do it.

[00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:21.080]
And if these people don't have them, I need to pay the book of Brian for Kranow.

[00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:23.420]
If they haven't got that money, then they ought to shut the damn thing down.

[00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:25.860]
Get a padlock and shut the baby down.

[00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:27.100]
Shut that transmitter off.

[00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:29.960]
Then you'll see some facts to start coming in.

[00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:32.400]
Oh, gee, they shut the door, QYM.

[00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:35.220]
You know damn well they got the money.

[00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:38.200]
Okay, in fact, I bet you George Abiesli could come in there right now and lay a check

[00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:39.360]
for a million bucks on your desk.

[00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:39.960]
Right.

[00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:40.940]
What?

[00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:42.320]
Not hers.

[00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:43.400]
Right, okay.

[00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:44.900]
As you can see.

[00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:46.540]
You know, I do.

[00:26:48.140 --> 00:26:48.940]
Unc Beasley.

[00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:52.320]
Unc Grims with Bunk and Junk and Punk.

[00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:54.500]
Grant and Punk and Skunk.

[00:26:54.700 --> 00:26:56.820]
Skunk, I like Skunk because there's a stench man.

[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.260]
There's an aroma coming from the Beasley Orifice man.

[00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:00.860]
He sent them an email.

[00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:02.080]
He didn't get a response yet.

[00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:04.640]
Get that man paid, gosh dang it.

[00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:06.300]
You idiots.

[00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:07.400]
Concern it.

[00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:09.120]
Yeah, Concern it.

[00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:10.320]
I think I'm going to say something else to you.

[00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:11.040]
Just hear the hell out of it.

[00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:11.400]
Yeah, I know.

[00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:11.780]
Likewise.

[00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:12.640]
Yeah.

[00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:15.180]
1160 votes on the pool.

[00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:16.400]
It's all about my death.

[00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:19.360]
And you can be sure that all those about me being a rotten bastard.

[00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:20.800]
Most of those are from inside the building.

[00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:23.440]
Probably from management types and also from Naples too.

[00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:25.860]
Probably a Joyce voted about 50 times, bitch.

[00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:27.940]
You know something?

[00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:28.680]
Nope.

[00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:32.260]
Although knowing that it's enough to make me want to play that bit again.

[00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:35.000]
I know part of them anymore.

[00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:36.880]
So I will do it right after the break.

[00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:37.720]
I'm going to play it again.

[00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:38.460]
I'm going to begin.

[00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:40.280]
Till it's coming out of our ears.

[00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:43.040]
I bet you everybody to do water coercing and she blows you.

[00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:43.480]

[00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:46.960]
Yeah, everyone telling people to see me all commentaries on that.

[00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:47.920]
Everybody loved it.

[00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:49.600]
Everybody loved it.

[00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:51.920]
On the day of the croaks, what will be your response?

[00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:54.060]
1160 people have voted so far.

[00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:56.780]
In fact, if I try 1161, see there's another one.

[00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:01.120]
He died doing what he wanted to do 340.

[00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:03.840]
And of course, I don't know who knows what I'm going to be doing when I die.

[00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:04.900]
I say I don't know what that is.

[00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:05.500]
Riding.

[00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:07.160]
Riding?

[00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:08.920]
Are you going to be cremated?

[00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:12.620]
Yeah, I'm thinking about it.

[00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:13.760]
Should I put that in the wheel too?

[00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:14.260]
Is that something?

[00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:16.180]
You have to have a living wheel for about how does that work?

[00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:18.620]
I think you put it in your wheel, but I'm not sure.

[00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:19.620]
Ask you to.

[00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:22.040]
Ask my lawyer.

[00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:22.420]
Yeah.

[00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:25.660]
He's too busy sending me emails about Jerry Falwell croaked.

[00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:27.460]
Jerry Falwell croaked.

[00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:28.360]
He's another one.

[00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:30.480]
He doesn't understand this show either of what I do here.

[00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:31.400]
Clueless.

[00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:32.020]
Clueless.

[00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:36.800]
So when he and Joe Bell have their confabs behind my back, it's the blind leading the very blind.

[00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:39.580]
It's the dumb leading the dumb or it's just it's sad.

[00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:43.180]
Neither one of them has got a freaking clue what this show is all about or what I do here.

[00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:48.160]
And then I get an indignant email from Norma saying, how can you publish something like that on the air?

[00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:49.320]
Yeah, I published this.

[00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:50.640]
I'm going to publish your Fag paper.

[00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:51.580]
Okay, get out of my face.

[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:52.380]
You silly.

[00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:53.200]
You fairy.

[00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:53.540]
That.

[00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:55.860]
He was a lovely human being.

[00:28:56.060 --> 00:28:56.600]
Blah blah blah.

[00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:57.280]
Who's in the wheel?

[00:28:57.660 --> 00:28:57.980]
255.

[00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:01.060]
I can tell you right today who's in the wheel, but I'm not going to mention names on the air.

[00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:02.100]
But George will be in there.

[00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:03.940]
I read told him that this morning.

[00:29:04.420 --> 00:29:07.420]
In fact, I informed a couple people at this morning and everybody's happy.

[00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:09.880]
255.

[00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:13.320]
The people that I care about will be in there.

[00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:17.340]
And on George's case, I don't want to say I care about him, but he's high shut.

[00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:18.980]
What?

[00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:20.220]
I said, ah, shucks.

[00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:22.780]
No, the people that I love will be in there plus George.

[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.000]
I don't want to say I love George.

[00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:24.940]
You know, I like George.

[00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:25.720]
That's fine.

[00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:26.560]
That's what I appreciate.

[00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:27.900]
But I don't love him.

[00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:28.360]
Good.

[00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:29.520]
In fact, we stay as far.

[00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:31.200]
That's why we've been working together so long.

[00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:32.180]
We stay very far apart.

[00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:32.640]
That's right.

[00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:33.800]
And worked out very well.

[00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:34.040]
Sure.

[00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:36.540]
He's in that big radio station in the sky.

[00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:38.500]
And not George, but me 172.

[00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:41.300]
He's makin' on Jesus right now, 114.

[00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:44.320]
He's died a free man in no wife, 96.

[00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:47.860]
I don't know why all these people are always poo-pooin' married so bad.

[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.060]
Oh, I shouldn't be having such a...

[00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:50.700]
Oh, stop.

[00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:53.540]
In other words, there's no happily married people.

[00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:54.260]
Were your parents?

[00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:55.820]
Oh.

[00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:58.060]
They got divorced after 30 years of it.

[00:29:58.420 --> 00:29:58.680]
Mm-hmm.

[00:29:59.060 --> 00:29:59.820]
Took them that long, huh?

[00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:01.760]
Then they were both crazy as a bedbug.

[00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:03.300]
I used to wonder, which...

[00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:05.140]
Because my mother was so annoying.

[00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:07.540]
I wondered as much as my father was a rotten bastard.

[00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:09.420]
I wondered if she made him the way he became.

[00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:09.840]
You know what I mean?

[00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:12.780]
It's like a talkative thing, which I don't...

[00:30:12.780 --> 00:30:13.300]
I thought about that.

[00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:16.280]
I'm sure there are happily married people, but most people just pretend that they are.

[00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:17.200]
We just haven't met him yet.

[00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:19.340]
He died a free man in no wife, 97.

[00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:20.700]
He was a durable 92.

[00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:24.060]
Oh, man.

[00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:25.640]
A durable.

[00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:27.560]
I'm lookin' at that mirror behind me, man.

[00:30:27.660 --> 00:30:30.260]
And if that's adorable, I hate to see what really bad looks like.

[00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:31.840]
He was a rotten bastard.

[00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:32.320]
Good ridden.

[00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:35.260]
A 66, 5.6% on 256.

[00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:37.220]
I guess that's just because it's 56.

[00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:41.280]
66 people, hating like poison, just can't wait till I croak.

[00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:41.820]
Well, guess what?

[00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:45.120]
I know he's up there looking down on us.

[00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:46.600]
26 soli people said that.

[00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:48.140]
Well, 1168.

[00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:50.980]
Told you by the top of the hour, we're going to be over 1200.

[00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:51.860]
We might just...

[00:30:51.860 --> 00:30:53.680]
We might break the bank here today when I pull.

[00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:56.880]
And then Chris can jump up and down like Rumble still.

[00:30:57.020 --> 00:30:57.960]
I could like to see that.

[00:30:58.080 --> 00:30:58.760]
I'd pay to see that.

[00:30:58.760 --> 00:30:59.360]
Huh?

[00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:03.620]
Hey, you can use the exercise, Tubby.

[00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:07.480]
I shouldn't have said that because Tulletubbies are in the news these days.

[00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:08.760]
What would you be following all?

[00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:10.280]
All right.

[00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:11.260]
Fall to roll.

[00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:13.800]
Can I do this pottery?

[00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:15.400]
I'm like, can you make a ball?

[00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:20.120]
I'll actually talk to Clarence about chicken neck.

[00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:21.100]
That's what I'm proud of you.

[00:31:22.020 --> 00:31:23.180]
See, there you go, chicken neck.

[00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:24.440]
George is working for him.

[00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:25.540]
Man, he's working his little ass out.

[00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:25.640]

[00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:26.340]
It's worth, yeah.

[00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:28.100]
Well, they already hate you anyway.

[00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:28.380]
So the game is over.

[00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:28.700]
That's great.

[00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:28.740]

[00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:28.740]

[00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:28.740]

[00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:28.740]

[00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:30.560]
They can ignore me less.

[00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:34.080]
Don't count on it, I won't.

[00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:36.640]

[00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:25.520]
she blow, she blow, she blow.

[00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:27.180]
she blow, she blow she blow.

[00:33:27.180 --> 00:33:29.520]
she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow.

[00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:30.620]
she blow, she blow.

[00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:32.940]
you blow, you blow, you blow.

[00:33:33.180 --> 00:33:33.500]
you blow, you blow.

[00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:34.620]
she blow, she blow,

[00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:36.440]
she blow, she blow, she blow.

[00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:37.600]
she blow, she blow, she blow.

[00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:40.820]
she blow, she blow, she blow.

[00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:44.320]
she blow, she blow, she blow.

[00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:47.060]
she blow, she blow, She blow, she blow.

[00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:48.820]
she smoke, she smoke, she smokes, she smokes, she smokes.

[00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:51.120]
she smoke, she smokes, she smokes, she smokes.

[00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:53.940]
He's got a seatbelt, he's got a seatbelt, he's got a seatbelt.

[00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:55.620]
He's got a seatbelt, he's got a seatbelt, he's got a seatbelt.

[00:33:55.740 --> 00:33:55.960]
He's got a seatbelt, he's got a seatbelt.

[00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:57.820]
You glow, you glow, you glow, you glow.

[00:33:57.820 --> 00:34:00.280]
Ain't no mud songs anymore.

[00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:03.720]
Since that decent infectious wall,

[00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:06.540]
Skanky Joyce took them away.

[00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:12.620]
Skanky Joyce took them away.

[00:34:14.340 --> 00:34:16.120]
Speaking of what happens when you croak,

[00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:17.540]
I'll guarantee you if there is a hell,

[00:34:17.700 --> 00:34:19.540]
she's gonna be rotting there in eternity.

[00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:20.940]
I'm going to tell you right now.

[00:34:21.660 --> 00:34:22.320]
Hateful Sal.

[00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:26.500]
1047-560-WDQM, Happy Thursday, May 17th.

[00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:28.460]
Here's the schedule for the NWQAM.

[00:34:28.780 --> 00:34:29.460]
Keep it secret.

[00:34:29.720 --> 00:34:31.160]
We got Mad Dog, Jim Maddich.

[00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:32.240]
Old number 88.

[00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:33.760]
We'll be on 2-5.

[00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:36.480]
The schedule says Mad Dog 2-4, and then Power Hour with Mad Dog.

[00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:38.140]
Because Hank said the Freakness.

[00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:39.920]
Oh, I better take a look at that for tomorrow.

[00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:40.540]
Don't forget.

[00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:43.160]
So that went Dave Johnson calls tomorrow.

[00:34:43.420 --> 00:34:44.460]
I'll pretend that I know what's going on.

[00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:47.100]
I just, I have no interest in thermo-racing,

[00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:48.440]
but we've been doing it for 100 years.

[00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:51.100]
And he picked the winner and so did the Humper and the Derby.

[00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:52.220]
So let's see.

[00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:54.200]
Power Hour and whatever.

[00:34:54.380 --> 00:34:56.280]
Mad Dog's on 2-5 is what it boils down to.

[00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:57.700]
Geldies on 5-630.

[00:34:57.720 --> 00:34:59.840]
You don't think they're going to put him on for the Power Hour?

[00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:00.400]
Yeah.

[00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:01.120]
God forbid.

[00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:03.220]
You think Mandage would put up with that crap?

[00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:04.000]
No, no chance.

[00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:05.480]
Geldie 5-630.

[00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:06.840]
How do Marlon's do last night, Chris?

[00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:09.660]
They won.

[00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:10.880]
Did they?

[00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:11.380]
Yeah.

[00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:12.560]
That was a 3-2.

[00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:14.520]
And the Sabers won last night, 3-2.

[00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:15.860]
That was the score of the hockey game.

[00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:18.120]
You're thinking of Buffalo 3, Ottawa 2, eh?

[00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:20.120]
And the Spokane wasn't too happy about it.

[00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:20.660]
Well, it's too bad.

[00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:21.700]
I thought I thought I'd put a can.

[00:35:23.060 --> 00:35:23.880]
Shuffer and Chuck attached.

[00:35:24.620 --> 00:35:25.940]
And Marlon's on 2-630.

[00:35:26.060 --> 00:35:27.460]
Marlon's at the Pirates at 705.

[00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:28.740]
Try to a sweep that series.

[00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:30.000]
I guess who they played over the weekend.

[00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:31.720]
Don't tell me I look here to play in a Tampa.

[00:35:31.940 --> 00:35:34.080]
Oh, why is that franchise exist?

[00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:36.600]
And then he and that would be the key after the Marlon game tonight.

[00:35:36.700 --> 00:35:38.560]
After we lose some more money with the Marlon's.

[00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:40.300]
That's why we're dumping them out of here for the next season.

[00:35:40.940 --> 00:35:41.420]
Get rid of it.

[00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:43.060]
Another example of all the money they lose.

[00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:45.280]
You know, because it's a sport thing.

[00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:45.940]
It's a game.

[00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:48.180]
Guys with Jockstrafts.

[00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:50.320]
So we're willing to lose all that money for years and years.

[00:35:50.380 --> 00:35:53.060]
Ever since the beginning of the franchise, they've lost money on that swill.

[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.180]
But oh no, we don't want to pay chicken act though,

[00:35:57.260 --> 00:35:58.400]
because that's a few hundred bucks.

[00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:01.340]
See, it would be one thing if it was a staggering amount, you know?

[00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:04.600]
But the things that they don't pay.

[00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:06.080]
Oh, I got a dilemma for it.

[00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:06.660]
I got a question.

[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:07.160]
Okay.

[00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:09.920]
You know my blankberry?

[00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:10.860]
I do it.

[00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:12.560]
Well, my cellular service.

[00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:14.300]
You know what my bill was for the month of April

[00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:16.100]
when I was in Europe, I was in Amsterdam.

[00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:17.400]
I don't know, a hundred bucks.

[00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:23.580]
I'm talking about for the cellular service and the all the roaming and gloaming.

[00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:24.920]
$4,200.

[00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:26.220]
Wow.

[00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:31.340]
You think maybe there's some kind of a problem there?

[00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:32.900]
Uh, mostly roaming.

[00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:34.060]
It's been roaming charges.

[00:36:34.220 --> 00:36:35.780]
For most people, that would be a problem, right?

[00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:37.220]
No, no, no, wait a minute.

[00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:41.060]
In other words, you think because I'm making money that I want to pay a 4,000 dollars bill.

[00:36:41.300 --> 00:36:41.500]
Of course you don't.

[00:36:41.660 --> 00:36:42.100]
Of course you don't.

[00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:42.900]
That was me being smart.

[00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:44.820]
I could say that's a chicken that can stand for Christ.

[00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:46.520]
Sure, he thought, yeah, I already paid them.

[00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:49.580]
I already paid those grave robbers.

[00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:51.520]
$4,200.

[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:52.840]
Now what am I doing wrong?

[00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:56.440]
I never had that problem before because I got, I got, it's in my contract.

[00:36:56.740 --> 00:36:57.780]
Because you want to Europe, right?

[00:36:57.880 --> 00:36:58.380]
That's what that was.

[00:36:58.380 --> 00:36:59.460]
Yeah, but I got that in my deal.

[00:36:59.460 --> 00:37:01.860]
I got that worldwide roaming and gloaming and, uh,

[00:37:02.020 --> 00:37:04.180]
then you need to put all of them up and say, yo, WTF.

[00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:08.660]
Yo, I don't call anybody up and say, yo, you should try it.

[00:37:08.780 --> 00:37:11.200]
Maybe you call up people and say, yo, yo.

[00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:13.420]
In Canada, you don't call anybody up and say, yo,

[00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:16.300]
because then you hear something really strange.

[00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:17.600]
Sounds like a dial tone to me.

[00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:20.800]
Larry Fax isn't says, I wasn't by a radio yesterday.

[00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:22.820]
Well, you know something, that's part of the problem, Larry.

[00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:25.420]
We need you by the radio, guys, dang it.

[00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:29.100]
Did you discuss about the horsemen at Pompano Park?

[00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:30.320]
Want more of the sloped profitor there?

[00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:30.780]
Aren't going to race?

[00:37:30.860 --> 00:37:32.780]
No, I did not discuss it because I didn't know anything about it.

[00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:37.400]
Even though I've been doing spots for Pompano Park for 31 years,

[00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:39.160]
since I came to town and my late friend,

[00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:42.160]
Alan J. Finkelson, arrived from Monticello at the same time I did.

[00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:43.180]
Simultaneous.

[00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:46.580]
And so I've been promoting Pompano Park for over 30 years,

[00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:48.020]
and then with this new sloped profitor,

[00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:50.240]
allowing, of course, Duff is on top of that deal.

[00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:50.740]
Hey, Duff.

[00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:51.300]
You're fair.

[00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:53.540]
So I get no information anymore from my buddy Steve Wolf

[00:37:53.540 --> 00:37:55.080]
or anybody else over there at Pompano Park

[00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:56.320]
because I don't know,

[00:37:57.080 --> 00:37:58.760]
because we've got a bunch of new people in over there.

[00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:00.060]
I think maybe too many goi am now.

[00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:02.200]
And then it says, and you're right,

[00:38:02.300 --> 00:38:03.400]
when you can afford to gamble,

[00:38:03.540 --> 00:38:04.840]
you don't have to set your house to do it,

[00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:05.660]
you don't have a problem.

[00:38:05.900 --> 00:38:07.400]
My wife and I dropped plenty at the Indians,

[00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:08.200]
but we don't want to stop.

[00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:10.100]
And let me just tell you this,

[00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:10.940]
we know when to stop,

[00:38:11.060 --> 00:38:12.200]
not just means losing,

[00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:14.080]
it also means if you're ahead.

[00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:16.640]
That's my suggestion for you.

[00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:17.760]
Anybody wants to go to a casino?

[00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:18.500]
Not just Slas,

[00:38:18.620 --> 00:38:19.980]
but any kind of gamble in the casino.

[00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:21.140]
When you get ahead,

[00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:22.860]
a reasonable amount of $1,000,

[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:23.980]
oh, it depends on, you know,

[00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:25.980]
what your finances are.

[00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:26.940]
I mean, in Georgia's case,

[00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:28.000]
if it was up 25 bucks,

[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:28.820]
he'd fly out of there.

[00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:29.260]
You know it.

[00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:30.720]
Or at Chris's case,

[00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:31.220]
if he wanted to,

[00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:31.660]
uh,

[00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:33.560]
but third man,

[00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:34.840]
so he'd fly out.

[00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:37.200]
So it all depends on your own financial situation.

[00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:39.360]
But that's the key to my, uh,

[00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:40.540]
failure. I mean, my losing,

[00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:42.000]
is that I know when to leave,

[00:38:42.060 --> 00:38:42.880]
if I'm losing my ass,

[00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:43.540]
and I know when to leave,

[00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:44.280]
if I'm winning something,

[00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:45.160]
you know, like, uh, Tuesday,

[00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:46.220]
I want a grand, I flew,

[00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:47.540]
I flew out of there, man.

[00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:49.260]
They couldn't have grabbed me,

[00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:50.220]
I moved so fast.

[00:38:51.420 --> 00:38:52.860]
And they're installing a wood by now,

[00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:53.580]
right in the main entrance

[00:38:53.580 --> 00:38:54.360]
when you walk in there,

[00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:55.440]
installing this gigantic,

[00:38:56.640 --> 00:38:57.680]
huge wheel of fortune,

[00:38:57.900 --> 00:38:58.680]
two cent machine.

[00:38:58.820 --> 00:38:59.200]
It's got all,

[00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:01.060]
it's got all the individual machines around it.

[00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:02.580]
It's one of those digital things,

[00:39:02.660 --> 00:39:03.660]
and even though it's two cents,

[00:39:03.660 --> 00:39:05.160]
you can play up to like 80s,

[00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:05.560]
and you know,

[00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:06.600]
you know, those digital ones,

[00:39:07.380 --> 00:39:08.540]
yes, the slot machines,

[00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:09.540]
where you can play like, uh,

[00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:10.360]
50 lines,

[00:39:10.580 --> 00:39:11.280]
and 85 credits,

[00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:12.020]
and all of a sudden,

[00:39:12.020 --> 00:39:13.960]
so I don't know, I hope I don't get hooked on that.

[00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:15.940]
It's only a two cent machine mine.

[00:39:16.780 --> 00:39:17.720]
But it's huge,

[00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:19.500]
and it's got this big ass wheel.

[00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:20.880]
They got more clever ways

[00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:22.760]
to extricate the money from your wallet, you know?

[00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:25.660]
So that's too bad about,

[00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:27.020]
the horseman in Pompo-no parking,

[00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:27.400]
the Audi Audi,

[00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:28.620]
but I don't know a damn thing about it.

[00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:30.000]
So no, I did not talk about it,

[00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:31.000]
and, uh, you know,

[00:39:31.260 --> 00:39:32.260]
probably less said the better.

[00:39:32.420 --> 00:39:32.860]
I don't know.

[00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:34.220]
I wonder how my buddy,

[00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:35.060]
Kim and Wallace is doing.

[00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:35.720]
How is Wall-E,

[00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:37.900]
how's it going, A?

[00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:39.300]
That Wall-E, man,

[00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:40.680]
he's a slippery as an eel.

[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:43.680]
1,195 votes on the pool today,

[00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:44.660]
all about an eel croaking.

[00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:45.680]
And guess what, you know,

[00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:47.200]
I'll just talk about my will,

[00:39:47.540 --> 00:39:47.800]
and who's,

[00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:48.840]
I'm doing pretty good.

[00:39:49.940 --> 00:39:50.600]
Do I sound good?

[00:39:50.740 --> 00:39:51.720]
I sound alive, sound great.

[00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:53.240]
Yeah, I would agree with you.

[00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:54.240]
Well, gay, but, yeah.

[00:39:56.280 --> 00:39:57.360]
I sound gay.

[00:39:58.160 --> 00:39:59.120]
Well, no gayer than usual.

[00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:01.320]
Oh, well, that's good.

[00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:03.000]
Because I am gay,

[00:40:03.260 --> 00:40:03.620]
and I'm, uh,

[00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:05.200]
I'm even more gayer than usual.

[00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:05.700]
Really?

[00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:05.700]

[00:40:06.180 --> 00:40:07.680]
Yeah, because I'm thinking about my trip up

[00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:08.880]
coming to Amsterdam this month.

[00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:09.680]
Oh, baby.

[00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:11.380]
I didn't know if that changed.

[00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:13.040]
Changed one.

[00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:13.660]
Like the climate.

[00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:14.400]
You're gayness, you know.

[00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:16.860]
Oh, my gayness increases tremendously.

[00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:18.020]
Although, I would say,

[00:40:18.220 --> 00:40:18.600]
and student,

[00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:19.660]
a lot of people think it's a,

[00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:20.380]
a fact place.

[00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:21.920]
And there is, of course,

[00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:23.300]
that place, the root of Assylene,

[00:40:23.420 --> 00:40:25.100]
which has got that very famous bar,

[00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:25.340]
the,

[00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:27.040]
ring, which I can't say the word on the ear.

[00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:28.700]
That's where Al Goldstein used to hang out.

[00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:30.860]
I know, it's a fact place,

[00:40:30.860 --> 00:40:31.540]
but he, you know,

[00:40:31.620 --> 00:40:33.460]
he kind of changes his altitude later on in life.

[00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:35.460]
I guess when all the women finally,

[00:40:35.700 --> 00:40:37.060]
uh, said, oh, on no more Al.

[00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:38.780]
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

[00:40:38.780 --> 00:40:40.600]
He, he, maybe got to feel anything alive,

[00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:42.500]
might be okay, especially after that little visit

[00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:43.500]
to Wreckler's Island there,

[00:40:43.540 --> 00:40:45.060]
maybe turned him around, so to speak.

[00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:46.300]
Although that was all before that.

[00:40:46.860 --> 00:40:48.220]
And I don't think he can go back to Amsterdam

[00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:49.040]
because, uh,

[00:40:49.140 --> 00:40:50.140]
he, they took away his passport.

[00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:51.620]
If you don't have,

[00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:52.200]
when a passport,

[00:40:52.340 --> 00:40:53.100]
though, you're screwed.

[00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:56.600]
Let me just say this to all you people

[00:40:56.600 --> 00:40:59.060]
listening. It's the 17th of May.

[00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:02.140]
We got June and July and August

[00:41:02.140 --> 00:41:03.320]
in September. We're labor day.

[00:41:03.540 --> 00:41:05.780]
A lot of vacation days come out for a lot of people out there.

[00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:07.240]
Get you a passport.

[00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:09.500]
Stop being so parochial and stupid.

[00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:12.320]
And a lot of people think it costs a fortune to go

[00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:13.140]
like to Europe and things.

[00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:14.560]
If you fly coach, you know,

[00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:15.120]
cattle,

[00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:17.340]
like, uh,

[00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:19.440]
you're the smart way to do unless you got some big bucks,

[00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:20.800]
then you can afford to go.

[00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:22.220]
Have a, have a great time.

[00:41:22.380 --> 00:41:23.340]
I'm telling you right now.

[00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:24.740]
But anyway, I was saying about Amsterdam.

[00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:25.760]
It's, I would say, uh,

[00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:27.120]
I would say 70,

[00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:28.840]
not 80, 80 to 20.

[00:41:29.260 --> 00:41:30.920]
80% straight, 20% K.

[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:34.480]
Of course, the, the lay of the land, if I can use that.

[00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:36.400]
I mean, that's just my general take on it.

[00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:39.000]
You know, I, I'm having been there 80,000.

[00:41:39.140 --> 00:41:40.140]
I'm having four months or so.

[00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:41.540]
Yeah, my informal survey.

[00:41:42.380 --> 00:41:43.600]
I mean, there's enough of whatever you want.

[00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:44.960]
If you're going there for a perversion sake,

[00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:46.160]
which other than drugs,

[00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:47.500]
I can't imagine what it would be.

[00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:50.380]
And let me recommend enthusiastically to make Donald's there

[00:41:50.380 --> 00:41:52.540]
on the dam rack, the one right by Dan Square.

[00:41:52.820 --> 00:41:53.060]
Mm-hmm.

[00:41:54.020 --> 00:41:54.260]
What?

[00:41:55.060 --> 00:41:57.080]
No, you've mentioned that the food down there is that Albert

[00:41:57.080 --> 00:41:59.200]
Hine convenience store right next to it too,

[00:41:59.220 --> 00:42:00.360]
which is really nice because, you know,

[00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:02.460]
I don't think about Europe, uh, a separate Copenhagen,

[00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:04.240]
where there's a 7-11 aisle on every street corner.

[00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:06.340]
I have no idea that it didn't used to be there any there.

[00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:09.300]
And last time I was in Copenhagen, every, every corner now,

[00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:10.220]
there's another 7-11.

[00:42:10.540 --> 00:42:11.940]
And they actually sell pizza in there.

[00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:12.880]
Pizza.

[00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:15.060]
Oh, but me?

[00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:16.880]
Yeah, I don't know what that's all about,

[00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:18.100]
but they're very big on 7-11.

[00:42:18.180 --> 00:42:20.300]
But most places in Europe, like in Rome, for example,

[00:42:20.780 --> 00:42:23.540]
uh, convenience stores are just, uh, you don't see much of that.

[00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:26.160]
There's not much convenience.

[00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:28.340]
And when you go on the supermarket,

[00:42:28.340 --> 00:42:29.760]
by the way, you have to pay for the bag.

[00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:31.780]
You better bring your own sack, unasucco.

[00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:34.060]
1197 on a pool.

[00:42:34.120 --> 00:42:36.360]
We are going to make 1200 by the top of the R and Chris's

[00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:38.140]
just, he's bouncing around like a child.

[00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:41.800]
Like a rubber ball, like Bobby V would say.

[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:43.740]
Like a rubber ball, a Bobby V.

[00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:45.940]
I remember that day that Phil Henry came running,

[00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:47.800]
and we, he and I were arguing about Bobby V.

[00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:50.240]
And, uh, Bobby V was okay.

[00:42:50.340 --> 00:42:51.820]
The night had a thousand eyes, if you got that?

[00:42:52.380 --> 00:42:53.020]
Yeah, I think so.

[00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:53.660]
But, uh, do you?

[00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:54.860]
Bobby, you don't want to play anymore.

[00:42:55.100 --> 00:42:55.560]
No, I'm fine.

[00:42:55.740 --> 00:42:55.740]

[00:42:56.300 --> 00:42:56.740]
It's not important.

[00:42:57.560 --> 00:42:58.540]
They don't want to hear Bobby V.

[00:42:59.100 --> 00:43:01.260]
It's like a rubber ball, and, uh, uh, uh,

[00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:03.760]
1197 votes on the day, on the, uh, the day,

[00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:05.440]
the croaks will be your response.

[00:43:07.780 --> 00:43:09.680]
Should probably put on there, we're going to have a party

[00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:10.380]
or something like that.

[00:43:10.500 --> 00:43:11.860]
But I guess you already got to one more.

[00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:13.620]
There you go, Bobby V.

[00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:15.280]
The night had a thousand eyes.

[00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:17.240]
The night had a thousand eyes.

[00:43:17.780 --> 00:43:19.380]
The night had a thousand eyes.

[00:43:19.900 --> 00:43:20.720]
Yeah, there it is.

[00:43:20.980 --> 00:43:21.560]
I know it.

[00:43:22.120 --> 00:43:22.640]
Bobby V.

[00:43:22.740 --> 00:43:24.260]
And the medley of my favorite Bobby V.

[00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:27.240]
It's a thing that you've run around ever.

[00:43:27.620 --> 00:43:29.020]
Nice talk, I knew it was.

[00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:30.560]
He's loverable.

[00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:32.460]
And that's what you want in the live-stream.

[00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:35.700]
It's on the doorbell, though.

[00:43:36.140 --> 00:43:36.460]
It's on the doorbell, though.

[00:43:36.460 --> 00:43:36.940]
It's on my doorbell.

[00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:39.200]
Well, after we come back from the break, we'll have to talk

[00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:41.520]
and then I can afford to read the response.

[00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:42.680]
You're listening to me.

[00:43:42.940 --> 00:43:44.260]
You're the only one who's watching us.

[00:43:44.360 --> 00:43:46.840]
We still hate you, George, and where's that dress for chicken at?

[00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:49.920]
This is the Neil Roger Show.

[00:43:51.300 --> 00:43:52.660]
What solid is your brain?

[00:43:54.700 --> 00:43:55.640]
Any questions?

[00:43:55.640 --> 00:43:55.640]

[00:43:57.900 --> 00:44:01.420]
Based on the day's season, other stations are getting away cash.

[00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:03.200]
Frizen, winter getaway.

[00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:05.420]
But we've got a bigger picture in mind.

[00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:08.560]
That's why, this year, big station is giving you...

[00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:09.340]
Sonner!

[00:44:09.660 --> 00:44:10.840]
What wills watch me?

[00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:11.740]
That's right.

[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:12.620]
No more hunger.

[00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:13.660]
No more war.

[00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:16.760]
Just billions of people you've done, even though we're smiling at you.

[00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:18.660]
Because they'll know your responsible for...

[00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:19.940]
Sonner!

[00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:21.540]
What wills watch me?

[00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:24.140]
Be listening, and when you hear this sound...

[00:44:24.140 --> 00:44:28.240]
In the seventh floor, you'll be able to get certificate for a large PC.

[00:44:28.700 --> 00:44:32.000]
And the automatically registered for the grand prize blind.

[00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:33.440]
The wind means...

[00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:36.180]
Onward, real toward men.

[00:44:36.620 --> 00:44:37.920]
Feet sonner, it's the real toward men.

[00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:38.960]
It's non-transferable.

[00:44:39.140 --> 00:44:42.260]
Feet sonner, it's the real toward men must be claimed by February 15th, 1992.

[00:44:42.860 --> 00:44:46.680]
Employees of this station and TV seats are ineligible for Feet sonner, it's the real toward men.

[00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:49.940]
If us, on, for Feet sonner, it's the real toward men.

[00:44:49.940 --> 00:44:50.980]
He's listening to me.

[00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:51.560]
I'm right.

[00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:54.160]
1992, bless and oldie and the goodie.

[00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:56.400]
And of course, it's not even the right time of the year to be playing that.

[00:44:56.440 --> 00:44:57.500]
But I haven't played it in so long.

[00:44:57.820 --> 00:44:59.340]
I thought, let's give it a shot, and I liked it.

[00:45:00.440 --> 00:45:04.700]
Fumma 8 on the full, but before we get to that, Larry, who's just out of control again today,

[00:45:04.940 --> 00:45:05.640]
I like these factors.

[00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:07.100]
Keep the factors pouring in, folks.

[00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:08.600]
Good stuff only.

[00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:12.980]
Because tomorrow is going to complete a full week of no calls.

[00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:16.180]
And I think this could be the first week of many, many no calls.

[00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:21.160]
And the guy with a palm tree, you know, with the Miami logo on his Myspace thing,

[00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:23.540]
we have 1,388 friends by the way in Myspace.

[00:45:23.780 --> 00:45:26.280]
I sure like to get over 1,400 by the end of the day tomorrow.

[00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:28.360]
Wouldn't that be a feather in my cap?

[00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:29.940]
It would be cool.

[00:45:30.200 --> 00:45:30.200]

[00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:32.760]
Stuck a feather in my cap and called me a macaroni.

[00:45:33.540 --> 00:45:35.180]
I do like macaroni and cheese.

[00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:36.760]
I think I have it or not.

[00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:37.740]
I can't do that.

[00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:39.980]
That's as bad as having ice cream.

[00:45:40.100 --> 00:45:43.120]
Now what would you rather have macaroni and cheese because you're doing the actins

[00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:44.320]
and you can't have either one?

[00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:46.680]
But if you had your druggers, you were going to cheat.

[00:45:46.940 --> 00:45:48.420]
Which would be more tempting to you?

[00:45:48.500 --> 00:45:49.500]
Nice macaroni and cheese.

[00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:52.280]
Not crap, but I'm talking about anything else for ice cream.

[00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:52.680]
Ice cream.

[00:45:53.080 --> 00:45:53.400]
No.

[00:45:54.300 --> 00:45:54.860]
I don't know.

[00:45:54.940 --> 00:45:56.540]
I think I'm more like into macaroni and cheese.

[00:45:56.800 --> 00:45:57.820]
I doubt it.

[00:45:57.920 --> 00:45:58.280]
What?

[00:45:59.140 --> 00:45:59.860]
I'm Tonya.

[00:46:00.220 --> 00:46:00.440]
All right.

[00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:01.160]
I'm Tonya.

[00:46:01.260 --> 00:46:03.820]
You don't think I'm as addicted to pasta as I am to ice cream?

[00:46:03.940 --> 00:46:04.660]
You're a dreaming man.

[00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:05.880]
You're a crazy person.

[00:46:06.500 --> 00:46:06.860]
Okay.

[00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:08.020]
I'm a pasta maniac.

[00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:10.280]
Oh, pasta la pasta.

[00:46:11.260 --> 00:46:17.720]
China is urged to US not to take punitive acts against this country's agriculture or good exporters,

[00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:21.280]
even though Chinese officials have determined that two Chinese companies intentionally

[00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:24.840]
contain American pay-foot ingredients within industrial chemical.

[00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:26.740]
Why haven't they been screaming about this story?

[00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:28.300]
I haven't even heard about this story of you.

[00:46:29.620 --> 00:46:30.860]
A little bit, but not, uh...

[00:46:30.860 --> 00:46:31.420]
Not very much.

[00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:32.080]
Not like that.

[00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:34.320]
I guess they don't want us to go to war with China, huh?

[00:46:34.460 --> 00:46:37.700]
Or they don't want more Chinese to call in all those loans and make America a go bankrupt.

[00:46:37.860 --> 00:46:38.020]
Right.

[00:46:38.260 --> 00:46:39.100]
They're paying the right people off.

[00:46:39.460 --> 00:46:43.380]
The government said this week that it shut down the two companies and detained several of their officials

[00:46:43.380 --> 00:46:46.760]
for their roles in setting off one of the largest pet food recalls US history.

[00:46:47.100 --> 00:46:50.380]
You see, the Chinese are like they eat dog, but they like to kill them too, I guess.

[00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:51.540]
You got to kill them before you eat them.

[00:46:52.340 --> 00:46:55.580]
China also said it hoped the case will not lead to trade frictions.

[00:46:56.160 --> 00:46:56.680]
Well, give me...

[00:46:56.680 --> 00:46:59.460]
Let me tell you right now, there's one kind of friction that's really good friction,

[00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:01.640]
and that's the kind that most people would really enjoy.

[00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:02.740]
Friction, you know?

[00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:04.740]
You know what I'm talking about, right?

[00:47:04.900 --> 00:47:05.360]
Friction is good.

[00:47:05.620 --> 00:47:07.640]
Every other kind of friction, no, is bad.

[00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:12.120]
Generally speaking, I'm sure I might find some exceptions, but you know, it's no fiction.

[00:47:12.140 --> 00:47:15.200]
And when I say you don't want no friction, unless of course it's the kind that you do want,

[00:47:15.260 --> 00:47:16.760]
which we know what that is, but we can't say it.

[00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:18.700]
Because then Joyce will get all the risks that they can't earn.

[00:47:20.060 --> 00:47:21.480]
1200 and 12 votes on the pool.

[00:47:22.600 --> 00:47:23.640]
On the day Neil Crokes...

[00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:25.420]
I mean, what a pleasant thing that is.

[00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:26.660]
You know, I got to sit here and read this.

[00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:28.420]
Of course, I'm the one that put the poll on there.

[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:30.900]
So, you know, and who's the one who sent this in?

[00:47:30.980 --> 00:47:33.060]
Is this the guy from University of America?

[00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:33.560]
I don't know.

[00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:35.540]
Again, Ray or one of those guys down there.

[00:47:35.540 --> 00:47:37.760]
They're all gathered around the radio down there, University of Dodge.

[00:47:38.120 --> 00:47:41.020]
Jesus, if they spend as much time selling cars as they do listening to the show,

[00:47:41.220 --> 00:47:43.100]
then we'd be in big trouble, because we need their crap.

[00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:45.760]
Got a bunch of taxes coming in yet or what?

[00:47:46.300 --> 00:47:46.440]
No.

[00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:46.760]

[00:47:48.080 --> 00:47:48.820]
1200 and 18.

[00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:49.900]
1200 and 18.

[00:47:50.020 --> 00:47:52.040]
I'm like, well, they're thinking about it now.

[00:47:53.340 --> 00:47:54.900]
On the day Neil Crokes will be your response.

[00:47:55.140 --> 00:47:56.000]
1200 and 18 will be.

[00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:57.420]
Now, what are we shooting for today?

[00:47:57.600 --> 00:47:58.540]
Chris, you think...

[00:47:59.380 --> 00:47:59.740]
Fourteen.

[00:47:59.940 --> 00:48:00.300]
Fourteen.

[00:48:00.300 --> 00:48:00.500]
Okay.

[00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:01.800]
What?

[00:48:02.380 --> 00:48:04.380]
I'll just say a 1350, you know, just to make it together.

[00:48:04.380 --> 00:48:05.740]
Stop with a 50 crap.

[00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:07.400]
What year is such a worst, man?

[00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:08.380]
I say 1350.

[00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:10.180]
How about 1301?

[00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:11.280]
How does that sound?

[00:48:11.380 --> 00:48:11.560]
Okay.

[00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:14.500]
Fourteen hundred or die.

[00:48:15.300 --> 00:48:16.260]
Die, die, innu.

[00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:19.200]
He died doing what he wanted to do with 358.

[00:48:19.660 --> 00:48:21.520]
I guess that was with Jerry Falwell yesterday morning.

[00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:22.960]
Was it yesterday or was it the day before?

[00:48:24.340 --> 00:48:25.680]
Day before Tuesday.

[00:48:26.180 --> 00:48:26.600]
He died.

[00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:27.500]
What do you want to do?

[00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:27.760]
Eat.

[00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:29.020]
He was at the Big Breakfast.

[00:48:29.460 --> 00:48:31.360]
He had a whole stack of flat jacks, no doubt.

[00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:33.920]
But a whole bunch of blueberry sauce poured all over it.

[00:48:34.180 --> 00:48:37.240]
And maybe six, seven big strips of a hand.

[00:48:37.620 --> 00:48:39.560]
And about 40 strips of bacon and he croaked.

[00:48:40.120 --> 00:48:40.680]
And he said,

[00:48:40.940 --> 00:48:42.220]
I'm dying out of here.

[00:48:42.580 --> 00:48:43.980]
And we had a big party and a big parade.

[00:48:43.980 --> 00:48:44.720]
Said, Hallelujah.

[00:48:44.940 --> 00:48:45.500]
Thank God.

[00:48:46.200 --> 00:48:48.380]
Well, I got a whole bunch of articles about that bastard, by the way.

[00:48:48.980 --> 00:48:50.200]
He was the lovely human being.

[00:48:50.340 --> 00:48:52.580]
Neil were talking, doing blah, blah, blah.

[00:48:52.700 --> 00:48:53.180]
Who's in the wheel?

[00:48:53.540 --> 00:48:53.900]
269.

[00:48:54.340 --> 00:48:55.500]
All worried about my money.

[00:48:55.580 --> 00:48:56.260]
Well, guess what, folks?

[00:48:56.580 --> 00:48:57.960]
Don't worry about it because you ain't getting on.

[00:48:58.640 --> 00:48:58.820]
Hmm.

[00:48:59.780 --> 00:49:02.580]
He's in a big radio station in the sky, 178.

[00:49:03.180 --> 00:49:05.440]
He's makin' on Jesus right now, 121.

[00:49:06.180 --> 00:49:08.160]
He died a free man, no wife, 101.

[00:49:08.420 --> 00:49:09.520]
He was adorable, 95.

[00:49:10.140 --> 00:49:11.160]
Adorable granny, Neil.

[00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:12.040]
She's such a sweetheart.

[00:49:13.660 --> 00:49:14.040]
95.

[00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:15.640]
He was a rotten bastard.

[00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:16.760]
Good riddance, 69.

[00:49:17.880 --> 00:49:20.360]
But by the way, thanks, Cisco, for the lecture about eating

[00:49:20.360 --> 00:49:21.340]
and also your Brandon.

[00:49:21.740 --> 00:49:22.760]
They're both trying to keep me alive.

[00:49:22.980 --> 00:49:24.680]
And I'm still screwin' up all the time.

[00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:26.040]
Good, good, good, what?

[00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:28.280]
Good that they're trying to keep you alive, bad that you're screwin' up.

[00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:30.860]
Well, no, they care about me, see, which is very nice and sweet.

[00:49:31.340 --> 00:49:31.900]
It is.

[00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:36.240]
A lot of people out there, all my, all my my space friends are trying to keep me alive.

[00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:36.980]
They're all good people.

[00:49:37.560 --> 00:49:40.020]
But I'm just a weak, you know, I'm into that sugar thing.

[00:49:40.300 --> 00:49:42.680]
I had carrot cake last night, which is better than having ice cream.

[00:49:43.660 --> 00:49:44.380]
Wouldn't you agree?

[00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:44.960]
Why?

[00:49:45.660 --> 00:49:46.540]
Why is that better?

[00:49:46.820 --> 00:49:48.780]
Because when you eat carrot cake, it's very heavy.

[00:49:48.940 --> 00:49:50.060]
You know what's like, it's like pecanon.

[00:49:50.060 --> 00:49:51.760]
Oh, yeah, it's not light like ice cream.

[00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:53.740]
Ice cream is light?

[00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:55.620]
Of course not.

[00:49:55.780 --> 00:49:56.840]
Are you a crazy person?

[00:49:56.840 --> 00:49:58.060]
What are you talkin' about?

[00:49:58.340 --> 00:49:59.060]
What are you talkin' about?

[00:49:59.140 --> 00:50:01.440]
You said carrot cake is better than ice cream, because it's not heavy.

[00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:03.500]
Because you can't eat that much of it.

[00:50:03.620 --> 00:50:04.520]
Because it is heavy.

[00:50:04.820 --> 00:50:06.840]
All right, like pecan pie, it's so ultra sweet.

[00:50:07.100 --> 00:50:10.300]
You couldn't sit down, eat a whole pecan pie, but I could eat a half gallon of ice cream.

[00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:10.920]
Ooh, pecan pie.

[00:50:10.920 --> 00:50:12.480]
Well, I mean, too sweet.

[00:50:12.940 --> 00:50:13.200]
Oh.

[00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:15.280]
That's what I'm sayin'.

[00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:16.240]
Ah, get out of the cake.

[00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:18.200]
What do you know about this, Mr. Skinny Atlas?

[00:50:18.680 --> 00:50:19.180]
Yeah, right.

[00:50:19.260 --> 00:50:20.920]
He got a free man, no wife 100, too.

[00:50:20.980 --> 00:50:21.900]
He was adorable 96.

[00:50:22.220 --> 00:50:24.120]
He was a rotten bastard good ridden, 69.

[00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:26.080]
5.6%.

[00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:27.940]
69 people hate me like poison.

[00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:28.900]
Well, guess what?

[00:50:30.880 --> 00:50:34.360]
As the eastern sand and network of Larry was on the feeling is...

[00:50:34.360 --> 00:50:34.700]
BAH!

[00:50:34.980 --> 00:50:35.380]
Mutual.

[00:50:37.140 --> 00:50:37.540]
Mutual.

[00:50:38.020 --> 00:50:42.240]
And I know he's up there looking down at us 27th silly people out of 128.

[00:50:42.520 --> 00:50:43.940]
Let me refresh you at 12.28.

[00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:44.280]
Wow.

[00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:48.580]
Coming in in huge chunks now from the West Coast, probably from Joyce over there in Naples.

[00:50:49.020 --> 00:50:52.160]
I'm gonna tell you right now, if they don't pay Volkabrine, if I don't get a defendant

[00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:55.060]
advanced by two o'clock today, that the thing is being taken care of.

[00:50:55.140 --> 00:50:57.160]
I'm gonna have one of my sick days today, tomorrow.

[00:50:57.760 --> 00:50:59.120]
Maybe today, maybe like right now.

[00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:04.920]
I mean, what other mechanism do we have to force them to cut their...

[00:51:04.920 --> 00:51:05.260]
That's it?

[00:51:05.820 --> 00:51:06.840]
I could point it out to me.

[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:10.680]
I could send a hostile email to Joe Bell and you know what he would do to tell me to wipe my ass with it.

[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:12.420]
Or maybe he'd wipe his with it.

[00:51:12.540 --> 00:51:13.660]
Oh, what a thought that is.

[00:51:14.540 --> 00:51:14.840]
Jesus.

[00:51:15.500 --> 00:51:16.920]
His ass must weigh more than I do.

[00:51:17.500 --> 00:51:18.020]
My whole body.

[00:51:19.380 --> 00:51:20.160]
He's all ass.

[00:51:21.020 --> 00:51:23.620]
So maybe you could ask him about it.

[00:51:23.620 --> 00:51:24.640]
You're not gonna do it.

[00:51:24.740 --> 00:51:25.980]
Say, hey Joe, what's this, Joe?

[00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:26.640]
Yo, Joe.

[00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:29.140]
Since you're a yo guy, you know, yo, yo.

[00:51:29.340 --> 00:51:30.700]
Does that make you cool if you say yo?

[00:51:30.980 --> 00:51:31.280]
Cooler.

[00:51:31.740 --> 00:51:32.620]
I don't wanna be cooler.

[00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:34.720]
I wanna be a funny, dirty old fart.

[00:51:34.900 --> 00:51:35.900]
Just like I do at a great time.

[00:51:38.160 --> 00:51:39.380]
I want to be me.

[00:51:40.840 --> 00:51:46.080]
In fact, I know all these old songs, the one song that I think sums up the Beasley Broadcasting people.

[00:51:46.080 --> 00:51:48.040]
Call me irresponsible.

[00:51:48.580 --> 00:51:49.860]
Who was that, Jack Jones, saying that?

[00:51:49.980 --> 00:51:50.520]
Somebody like that.

[00:51:50.980 --> 00:51:51.760]
Everybody's saying it.

[00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:56.960]
Call me irresponsible because that's what a company that's listed on the freaking NASDAQ Stock Exchange,

[00:51:57.440 --> 00:51:58.780]
BBGI, which you don't wanna buy.

[00:51:59.080 --> 00:52:00.900]
That's what they are when they refuse to pay their bills.

[00:52:02.300 --> 00:52:03.600]
They're the laughing stock.

[00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:06.840]
And look what they've done to this radio station. It's one great radio station.

[00:52:07.820 --> 00:52:13.020]
They've, they've put up some numbers, man, in his last couple of books that I wouldn't wish on Heinrich Himmler and Joyce.

[00:52:13.140 --> 00:52:13.700]
How do you like that?

[00:52:13.700 --> 00:52:15.300]
Never see the two of them together, by the way.

[00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:16.120]
Same Nazi.

[00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:16.840]
That's it.

[00:52:17.220 --> 00:52:18.200]
Heinrich Himmler Joyce.

[00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:24.500]
Speaking of bitches, Paris Hilton will serve about half of her 45-day jail sentence.

[00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:27.760]
It will be separated from the general inmate population authorities, be saying.

[00:52:28.180 --> 00:52:28.820]
Poor Paris.

[00:52:29.320 --> 00:52:29.500]
Why?

[00:52:30.280 --> 00:52:34.720]
The hotel heiress will spend about 23 days in a special needs housing unit.

[00:52:34.900 --> 00:52:40.240]
The century-regional detention center at suburban Linwood, LA County Sheriff's spokesman Steve Whitmore said.

[00:52:40.680 --> 00:52:44.040]
Her sentence was shortened after jail officials gave her credit for good behavior.

[00:52:44.740 --> 00:52:49.620]
Officials considered several factors in calculating the credit, including that she appeared for her latest court date.

[00:52:49.940 --> 00:52:52.900]
Oh, geez, let's give her a million dollars, too. I'm sure she needs it.

[00:52:53.900 --> 00:53:00.740]
Hilton will stay in the unit that contains 12-2 person cells reserved for police officers, public officials, celebrities, and other high-profile inmates.

[00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:06.640]
Like everyone else in the 2200 inmate facilities, Hilton will get at least an hour outside her cell each day to shower.

[00:53:06.640 --> 00:53:10.300]
Watch TV, participate in outdoor recreation or talk on the telephone.

[00:53:10.600 --> 00:53:15.440]
And by the way, anybody that wants to see Paris Hilton naked, you are beyond desperate. You are pathetic.

[00:53:16.360 --> 00:53:20.220]
Oh, she made that tape, you know? Yeah. Oh, remember that when that thing came out and we were asking you.

[00:53:20.340 --> 00:53:22.960]
Sure, you just do that, George? As if George wanted to see that picture.

[00:53:23.320 --> 00:53:23.620]
Yeah, unfortunately I did.

[00:53:23.900 --> 00:53:26.760]
So, oh, oh no, one of you never been the same again.

[00:53:27.820 --> 00:53:32.440]
The 26-year-old socialite, it says, here in other words, rich bitch, was sentenced to jail this month,

[00:53:32.440 --> 00:53:38.120]
providing the terms of appropriation and alcohol-related reckless driving case, a judge ordered to report to jail by June 5.

[00:53:39.300 --> 00:53:46.100]
A call to her lawyer, D.Y. Specialist Richard Hilton was not immediately returned. Her publicist, Elliot Mints, declined to comment.

[00:53:46.180 --> 00:53:49.920]
He's probably missing, as we speak. You know what they said about guys who Mints.

[00:53:50.060 --> 00:53:50.460]
You're fair.

[00:53:51.480 --> 00:53:56.500]
1230, maybe, on the dial WDJ and O. West Palm Beach. That's why I used to work, man, 1975. I was alive.

[00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:02.760]
I was doing that protein-sparing fast. Maybe I should try that again. How the hell did I ever do that?

[00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:10.260]
I don't know, willpower or just stupidity. You know, just drink that pink ambiotic fluid every day out of a big jug.

[00:54:10.540 --> 00:54:17.500]
Oh, brother, talk about big jugs. How the hell did I used to select that around you? You know, you'd look with protein. I was like, that's way before your time.

[00:54:18.180 --> 00:54:19.900]
No, I remember that stuff. Do you? Sure.

[00:54:20.340 --> 00:54:25.660]
It was a pink bunch of stuff in a bottle. I used to cost an arm and a leg. You'd mix it in water and you'd drink that all day.

[00:54:25.660 --> 00:54:31.060]
The myth of it was that you get enough protein so you didn't wind up wasting away, but you'd be fasting.

[00:54:31.340 --> 00:54:32.920]
So you were fasting no solid food.

[00:54:34.480 --> 00:54:37.020]
Boy, I'd tell you the way to drop it off you.

[00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:41.400]
And then, of course, people started dying from it. They said, oh, maybe this isn't such a good idea after all.

[00:54:41.500 --> 00:54:44.740]
I forget the guy who started that protein. A doctor, of course, not a doctor.

[00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:45.120]
Sure.

[00:54:45.960 --> 00:54:48.220]
I've decided what I'm going to do about my doctor situation.

[00:54:48.860 --> 00:54:49.260]
Get a Canadian?

[00:54:50.040 --> 00:54:51.360]
No, I'm just not going.

[00:54:51.900 --> 00:54:52.300]
I see.

[00:54:54.280 --> 00:54:57.040]
What? You see what? You're going to need a doctor at some point.

[00:54:57.280 --> 00:55:01.100]
At some point? Well, what I need when I'll go to the emergency place. They have plenty of those around here.

[00:55:02.140 --> 00:55:05.280]
I go to the emergency doctor. That's why I get my prescriptions. I'll save half of the money.

[00:55:05.520 --> 00:55:08.540]
Why the hell should I get robbed by the American pharmaceutical companies?

[00:55:08.780 --> 00:55:12.500]
What I can get exactly the same drugs here for half price or less? Huh? Right.

[00:55:12.920 --> 00:55:14.240]
Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh?

[00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:19.440]
Too many sheep, man. Too many sheep and so little time. Not enough shears.

[00:55:20.560 --> 00:55:27.060]
Crawl 32 on the pole. We're going for 1400. Chris, of course, said 1350, being the weakling that he is.

[00:55:27.200 --> 00:55:31.380]
Why don't you book up a little bit? You think working on this show? In fact, I think Chris is the perfect guy.

[00:55:32.080 --> 00:55:35.680]
To go with the marching and right now to Joe Bells often say, listen, dammit.

[00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:39.340]
Niels getting really peeled. He ain't even going to show tomorrow if you don't get Boka Brian taking care of.

[00:55:40.020 --> 00:55:41.360]
Do you think Chris has a guy to do that?

[00:55:41.980 --> 00:55:43.080]
I do. I absolutely do.

[00:55:43.700 --> 00:55:44.920]
Let's go to the next break.

[00:55:45.640 --> 00:55:50.140]
Next break, I want you to march right in there and say, hey, listen, jolly, you jackass.

[00:55:51.240 --> 00:55:54.420]
And of course, you think he's going to call up over there and like, oh, he's right.

[00:55:55.140 --> 00:55:56.340]
He's scared of his own shadow.

[00:55:57.320 --> 00:55:59.420]
He's got pictures of Joyce all around Surah.

[00:55:59.700 --> 00:56:03.080]
And you know something, the eyes and those pictures move too. That's something that's scary.

[00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:06.460]
Her eyes move around. She's watching his every movement.

[00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:11.320]
1113 at 560 WQM, everybody knows a great night.

[00:56:11.320 --> 00:56:16.760]
Sleep starts with a comfortable mattress. And the world's most comfortable mattress is just one phone call away at 1-800-Matrus.

And when you call Ask About Clarence, pricing on other discontinued models as well.

[00:56:45.860 --> 00:56:51.760]
I've been using dial a mattress for about 100 years, and everybody here at QM is doing it now because it's changing the way people shop for mattresses,

[00:56:52.040 --> 00:56:54.740]
no schlepping and running around, no getting ripped off, no off-name brands.

[00:56:54.740 --> 00:56:58.160]
It's the modern way, the smart way, to get you a great night sleep for years to come.

[00:56:58.580 --> 00:57:03.800]
So just pick up that instrument and dial a mattress on the web, it's mattress.com or call 1-800-Matrus.

[00:57:03.800 --> 00:57:06.480]
1-800-Matrus.com.

[00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:11.260]
We're off the last as because it stands for Steu-Pen to Savings and Suffering to Suck a Tag.

[00:57:11.520 --> 00:57:14.460]
The biggest name, the biggest name, the best talent.

[00:57:15.060 --> 00:57:18.940]
And your official home for Miami Dolphins football.

[00:57:19.100 --> 00:57:23.760]
That's a telepastable way in these sports stuff, action into the exhaust.

[00:57:24.120 --> 00:57:27.740]
4th radio, 560, QAM.

[00:57:28.740 --> 00:57:31.920]
2-Night on the Discovery Channel.

[00:57:32.200 --> 00:57:44.900]
We actually discovered something by uncovering the recently discovered partial remains of a lost tape interview from a 1957 BBC broadcast with Barack Obama's father, the late Barack Obama senior.

[00:57:45.900 --> 00:57:50.380]
You and your wife searched through a catalog of really awful names.

[00:57:50.700 --> 00:57:53.920]
To impede your son's promising future, is that correct?

[00:57:53.920 --> 00:57:57.060]
Yes, this was shortly before he was born, of course.

[00:57:57.300 --> 00:58:00.520]
And I wanted to make going through life as hard as it was for me.

[00:58:01.060 --> 00:58:02.980]
And not to mention, I thought it would be funny.

[00:58:03.420 --> 00:58:06.300]
Yes, it was some of your first choices.

[00:58:06.880 --> 00:58:09.100]
Initially, I wanted to go with Tusha Bob.

[00:58:09.760 --> 00:58:13.920]
Yes, it says here, you wanted to name your boy Sue.

[00:58:14.180 --> 00:58:15.140]
Yes, it's true.

[00:58:15.420 --> 00:58:19.580]
But that was around the time Johnny Cash sang a song called Boy Name Sue.

[00:58:20.100 --> 00:58:22.480]
And how do you do? What could I do?

[00:58:22.480 --> 00:58:24.000]
Not name him Sue.

[00:58:24.460 --> 00:58:29.000]
Silly names aside, weren't you at all concerned about your son's future?

[00:58:29.840 --> 00:58:33.880]
I didn't consider in the event he may want to run for political office someday.

[00:58:34.260 --> 00:58:37.080]
I could have went with Bill Williams or something.

[00:58:37.280 --> 00:58:39.600]
That would have made his life much too easy.

[00:58:40.340 --> 00:58:42.680]
You chose not to go with Bill Williams?

[00:58:42.880 --> 00:58:48.280]
Oh, yes, yes. I was partial to Mambo Balambo, but my wife was vehemently opposed to it.

[00:58:48.280 --> 00:58:50.200]
Mambo Balambo?

[00:58:50.580 --> 00:58:50.980]
Yes.

[00:58:51.200 --> 00:58:54.340]
And his middle name was going to be Quasi Motel.

[00:58:54.620 --> 00:58:54.920]
Yes.

[00:58:55.060 --> 00:58:58.120]
Hitler would have been funnier than that, but may have caused some problems.

[00:58:58.400 --> 00:58:59.500]
So we went with who say?

[00:58:59.920 --> 00:59:02.180]
You will forgive me, sir, but that's insane.

[00:59:02.540 --> 00:59:03.500]
No, who say?

[00:59:03.980 --> 00:59:06.900]
One of the 19 at 560 WQM, has he gotten paid yet or what?

[00:59:07.020 --> 00:59:07.840]
Is that checking his mail?

[00:59:07.980 --> 00:59:08.660]
Has he got the...

[00:59:08.660 --> 00:59:09.100]
I haven't heard anything.

[00:59:09.500 --> 00:59:10.060]
Direct deposit?

[00:59:11.060 --> 00:59:15.040]
I want to keep updated on this thing too, because I may take office several days a second.

[00:59:15.040 --> 00:59:16.160]
You know, I got all these sick days coming.

[00:59:16.280 --> 00:59:17.180]
I don't ever call in sick.

[00:59:17.180 --> 00:59:17.460]
Do I?

[00:59:17.580 --> 00:59:17.720]
No.

[00:59:18.520 --> 00:59:19.120]
No, lately.

[00:59:19.960 --> 00:59:20.240]
1200.

[00:59:20.880 --> 00:59:22.780]
Once the last time I had any sick day, what did it mean?

[00:59:22.940 --> 00:59:23.160]
Not lately.

[00:59:23.160 --> 00:59:23.740]
I don't know what it meant.

[00:59:23.740 --> 00:59:24.320]
That I would call it.

[00:59:24.820 --> 00:59:26.020]
Long time ago, man.

[00:59:26.220 --> 00:59:26.840]
Not long enough.

[00:59:27.520 --> 00:59:28.380]
Long time ago.

[00:59:29.620 --> 00:59:30.720]
1243 votes on a poll.

[00:59:31.500 --> 00:59:35.920]
The Senate yesterday easily defeated a measure to effectively end most U.S. combat operations

[00:59:35.920 --> 00:59:36.940]
in the Mack by next April.

[00:59:37.280 --> 00:59:40.820]
But the 29 senators who voted for the amendment represented the highest number yet who have

[00:59:40.820 --> 00:59:44.400]
been elected behind a proposal, the first president Bush, the butcher of Washington and

[00:59:44.400 --> 00:59:47.620]
murderer, the lunatic, to bring the American troops home.

[00:59:48.920 --> 00:59:53.020]
The plan by senators Russ Feingold and Senator Judy Lee or Harry Reid didn't gather nearly

[00:59:53.020 --> 00:59:53.940]
enough votes to pass.

[00:59:54.340 --> 00:59:59.540]
67 senators, 47 Republicans and 20 Democrats opposed the proposal.

[01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:04.660]
The amendment won the vote of 28 Democrats and won independent.

[01:00:04.820 --> 01:00:08.360]
But it's a fort for the fine-gold read measure, which followed a similar House vote last week.

[01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:12.360]
Provide another indication about public pressure when the war is pushed congressional Democrats

[01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:16.980]
to embrace once politically tabled plans that challenged Bush's management of the war.

[01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:21.540]
And guess who voted against this bill?

[01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:26.300]
Mel Martinez and Bill Nelson.

[01:00:26.780 --> 01:00:27.640]
I just mentioned it in the past.

[01:00:28.180 --> 01:00:29.940]
In fact, here's the list on the right.

[01:00:30.060 --> 01:00:30.840]
She's so stupid.

[01:00:34.700 --> 01:00:36.380]
20 Democrats voted against.

[01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:41.320]
I'm just looking at the list to see if there's anybody without an...

[01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:41.880]
Oh, look at that.

[01:00:42.360 --> 01:00:43.180]
Car 11 of Michigan.

[01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:43.840]
Isn't that nice?

[01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:46.280]
Maria Landu of Louisiana.

[01:00:46.820 --> 01:00:47.700]
Joe Lieberman, of course.

[01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:48.880]
He's a Democrat right.

[01:00:49.140 --> 01:00:49.900]
Krishmire and Tulsa's Jew.

[01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:50.400]
Joe.

[01:00:53.380 --> 01:00:54.540]
Bill Nelson of Florida.

[01:00:54.540 --> 01:00:55.480]
Well, that's really embarrassing.

[01:00:55.960 --> 01:00:56.640]
That is pathetic.

[01:00:58.120 --> 01:00:59.960]
But what do you expect from a Yahoo like him?

[01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:01.560]
He's just another nose-picking red neck.

[01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:03.960]
Excuse me for the redundancy there.

[01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:09.120]
Most of the other ones are like, you know, small potatoes.

[01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:12.820]
But anyway, 20 Democrats voted against it because they're spineless and they have no

[01:01:12.820 --> 01:01:13.420]
backbone.

[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:14.520]
And they're weak.

[01:01:14.860 --> 01:01:15.360]
They're weak.

[01:01:16.420 --> 01:01:21.160]
Like Al Martino and the Godfather, their voices weak and their effectiveness is weak,

[01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:22.000]
not existent.

[01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:24.580]
That's not a weak.

[01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:27.120]
I think he's wearing his gun and so.

[01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:29.200]
You cannot talk about it.

[01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:33.040]
249 votes on the poll.

[01:01:33.180 --> 01:01:34.500]
We got 14 out of it and made them the shade.

[01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:36.140]
And Krishmire, 1350.

[01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:37.980]
Don't shoot so low.

[01:01:38.180 --> 01:01:38.520]
Will you please?

[01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:40.120]
That's what the Dick Cheney's friend said.

[01:01:40.300 --> 01:01:41.220]
Don't shoot so low.

[01:01:41.860 --> 01:01:42.140]
Okay.

[01:01:42.660 --> 01:01:44.700]
I got about 600 articles about Jerry Falwell.

[01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:47.400]
You know, maybe I ought to take the break a little bit early because once I get into

[01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:48.400]
these, I may be on a roll.

[01:01:48.580 --> 01:01:49.320]
You know, on a jelly roll.

[01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:50.080]
That sounds pretty good.

[01:01:50.180 --> 01:01:53.100]
Although ice cream cake rolls sounds so much better.

[01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:56.680]
And I know every time I mention that, George is like, well, what's that?

[01:01:57.320 --> 01:01:58.120]
What are you talking about?

[01:01:58.120 --> 01:02:01.320]
Or you know what I don't know what a ice cream cake roll is?

[01:02:01.420 --> 01:02:02.240]
Well, somebody didn't know.

[01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:07.860]
Maybe, Josh, Cortes, maybe somebody who was sitting there didn't know for an ice cream

[01:02:07.860 --> 01:02:08.380]
cake roll.

[01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:12.400]
I mean, any fat person like me, we know every kind of like crap like that.

[01:02:13.220 --> 01:02:14.340]
I haven't seen one of those in years.

[01:02:14.420 --> 01:02:16.440]
I could eat the whole thing if they still sold them in the supermarket.

[01:02:16.440 --> 01:02:17.740]
I don't see them anymore.

[01:02:17.900 --> 01:02:18.220]
Well, they do.

[01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:19.160]
They do?

[01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:21.580]
Yeah, not the eating cartbells still sell those.

[01:02:21.620 --> 01:02:22.100]
Carvell sales.

[01:02:22.740 --> 01:02:23.320]
I don't know.

[01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:25.660]
Maybe somebody Carvell sell like real ice cream, do you think?

[01:02:25.660 --> 01:02:26.520]
I don't know.

[01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:29.380]
Haven't they had a Carvell product in 20 years?

[01:02:29.420 --> 01:02:30.560]
They sell like soft syrup.

[01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:33.560]
All the Carvell flying sauces though, I can have like 15 or 20 of those.

[01:02:33.780 --> 01:02:34.620]
It wouldn't be too bad for them.

[01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:35.480]
I like cookie puss.

[01:02:39.900 --> 01:02:41.140]
I'll go for the cookie part.

[01:02:43.380 --> 01:02:44.420]
254 votes on the pool.

[01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:47.260]
I just keep mentioning the number on there because I want to encourage you know, it's

[01:02:47.260 --> 01:02:48.720]
a psychological thing, you know?

[01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:52.960]
If you move quickly now, if you can get in on the phone, of course I'm not taking any

[01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:53.220]
calls.

[01:02:53.220 --> 01:02:56.040]
I don't even remind me to turn that thing on tomorrow for Dave Johnson.

[01:02:57.040 --> 01:02:57.620]
Because how are you?

[01:02:58.080 --> 01:03:00.560]
I mean, not that it takes a long time to turn that monitor on.

[01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:01.940]
You know how long it takes to turn it on to run?

[01:03:02.140 --> 01:03:02.280]
I don't know.

[01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:04.140]
Two shakes of a little like that long.

[01:03:06.260 --> 01:03:09.500]
But just because Dave Johnson will be calling in the preview of the pre-pneast run, that's

[01:03:09.500 --> 01:03:13.040]
why the Humphors off yesterday he wasn't around, he isn't around today and not around

[01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:13.320]
tomorrow.

[01:03:14.660 --> 01:03:16.500]
He's around, but he's not around.

[01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:18.700]
He's mighty around.

[01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:20.180]
I don't know what we're going to do about him either.

[01:03:20.180 --> 01:03:23.460]
They're talking about me and carrot cake and ice cream and stuff like that.

[01:03:23.580 --> 01:03:24.560]
I'm just, I'm not doing well.

[01:03:25.740 --> 01:03:29.180]
Maybe because of the fact that all that pressure that's just going brand of they mean well,

[01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:31.780]
they're trying to keep me alive and they're good friends and etc. and so on.

[01:03:31.860 --> 01:03:35.640]
But maybe because I'm like, that's a bad excuse.

[01:03:35.860 --> 01:03:36.840]
Now they're doing the right thing.

[01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:38.660]
They're all over me like stink on Joyce.

[01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:40.640]
Don't do it, Neil.

[01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:41.280]
Don't do it.

[01:03:41.300 --> 01:03:42.260]
We want to keep you alive.

[01:03:42.540 --> 01:03:42.680]
You know?

[01:03:43.540 --> 01:03:44.820]
Not that we like you, but we're selfish.

[01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:45.860]
We might hear you on the area.

[01:03:46.020 --> 01:03:47.020]
We're like, that would be good.

[01:03:47.220 --> 01:03:47.820]
They do like me.

[01:03:48.020 --> 01:03:48.200]
A lot.

[01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:49.000]
They love me.

[01:03:50.300 --> 01:03:55.200]
But nevertheless, you know, when you're addicted to something, like some people have a crack

[01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:55.920]
problem, you know?

[01:03:56.840 --> 01:03:59.860]
Of course, some people are addicted to different kind of crack than others, but that's beside

[01:03:59.860 --> 01:04:00.240]
the point.

[01:04:00.700 --> 01:04:01.460]
If you catch my drift.

[01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:02.720]
I don't know.

[01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:03.740]
I'm not having anything this time.

[01:04:04.580 --> 01:04:08.280]
From 54 when I pulled, I'm going to click it again and now I think Chris is a believer

[01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:08.500]
now.

[01:04:08.580 --> 01:04:09.440]
He knows we're going to get 14.

[01:04:09.740 --> 01:04:12.820]
In fact, he's probably thinking why did the old man shoot for a 15 today, huh?

[01:04:13.340 --> 01:04:13.500]
Yeah.

[01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:14.180]
Isn't that what you're thinking?

[01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:14.720]
Yeah.

[01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:16.020]
Yeah, well, quit thinking.

[01:04:16.020 --> 01:04:19.240]
The biggest name of the biggest name of this talent.

[01:04:19.940 --> 01:04:23.680]
And your official home for Miami Dolphins football.

[01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:25.920]
Jason Taylor basketball away.

[01:04:26.140 --> 01:04:28.300]
He sports from basketball to the edge.

[01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:32.020]
Sports radio 560 QAM.

[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:34.780]
Well, attention.

[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:46.000]
Nirvana fans have been seen own a piece of the late Kurt Cobain, Courtney Ruff, since

[01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:07.780]
the first time I've seen a lot of the fans.

[01:05:07.780 --> 01:05:07.780]

[01:05:07.780 --> 01:05:07.780]

[01:05:07.780 --> 01:05:07.820]
I've seen a lot of the fans.

[01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:09.600]
I've seen a lot of the fans.

[01:05:09.900 --> 01:05:11.940]
I've seen a lot of the fans.

[01:05:11.940 --> 01:05:15.980]
I've seen a lot of the fans.

[01:05:15.980 --> 01:05:37.240]
I've seen a lot of the fans.

[01:05:43.020 --> 01:05:45.960]
They're a rare record in our latest episodes of this kind.

[01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:50.800]
And once we get to June, I'm like, let's see, June, July, August, a couple of weeks in

[01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:52.620]
September, I'm not going to be around too much.

[01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:54.100]
Right?

[01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:55.460]
To hold you guys hand.

[01:05:55.560 --> 01:05:57.040]
You're going to have to pretty much be on your own.

[01:05:57.240 --> 01:05:58.640]
Now, what are we going to do this side?

[01:05:58.760 --> 01:06:01.380]
I forget the way we did last year, like they hunted years before that.

[01:06:01.620 --> 01:06:04.160]
We shouldn't play any tapes, and I know you work Monday Wednesday and Friday.

[01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:05.120]
I do Tuesday and Thursday.

[01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:09.080]
But I'm just curious about the stories on the internet.

[01:06:09.640 --> 01:06:10.820]
Did I put all those on there?

[01:06:10.980 --> 01:06:11.440]
Yeah, you did.

[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:13.160]
Well, why do I keep doing that?

[01:06:13.300 --> 01:06:14.120]
Because you'd like it.

[01:06:14.700 --> 01:06:15.600]
Because you'd like doing it.

[01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:16.900]
It's fun for you.

[01:06:18.100 --> 01:06:19.480]
You are so full of it.

[01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:20.100]
Do you like it?

[01:06:20.260 --> 01:06:20.520]
No.

[01:06:21.720 --> 01:06:22.580]
It's a lot of work.

[01:06:23.320 --> 01:06:24.120]
I know it's a lot of work.

[01:06:24.580 --> 01:06:26.500]
Yeah, oh, that's what I'm trying to do with it.

[01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:27.060]
I like it.

[01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:29.100]
I'm not seeing how that, if you say it, I'm going to believe it.

[01:06:29.180 --> 01:06:29.560]
Oh, you did.

[01:06:29.660 --> 01:06:30.800]
You always have done it in the past.

[01:06:31.220 --> 01:06:32.100]
Yeah, because I'm a good guy.

[01:06:32.220 --> 01:06:32.660]
Yes, you are.

[01:06:32.760 --> 01:06:33.020]
You're a good guy.

[01:06:33.380 --> 01:06:35.000]
Because I feel responsible, I like it.

[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:36.580]
You know, it's my show, and it's my website.

[01:06:36.900 --> 01:06:36.980]
Right.

[01:06:37.140 --> 01:06:40.520]
I want to put some good crap on here, and I want to make trash work for that grant that

[01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:42.320]
I pay for is a dog's operation or whatever.

[01:06:42.500 --> 01:06:44.100]
And I have hard art for those stories.

[01:06:44.100 --> 01:06:47.200]
I have hard art or easy after all I've carried cake, no doubt.

[01:06:48.540 --> 01:06:52.440]
I see, I start talking about that stuff, and I'm not really hungry for that now.

[01:06:52.520 --> 01:06:53.600]
I'm hungry for macaroni and cheese.

[01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:56.500]
I can't go to woodbind today because it's just up in there two days in a row.

[01:06:56.820 --> 01:06:57.720]
And I go set it any morning.

[01:06:57.940 --> 01:07:01.380]
I don't want to start because if I go too much then it'll be like I have a gambling problem.

[01:07:01.660 --> 01:07:01.940]
Mm-hmm.

[01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:03.840]
And not that I'm losing lately.

[01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:05.480]
All of a sudden lately I'm on a pretty good streak.

[01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:07.520]
Either win or I break even, which believe me.

[01:07:07.860 --> 01:07:09.680]
That's how they lose your time when you break even.

[01:07:10.780 --> 01:07:12.380]
Mostly on the $5 machine mine.

[01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:15.360]
If you got the money, you don't forget about the dollar machines.

[01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:17.340]
They're sucker play, play the $5 machines.

[01:07:18.180 --> 01:07:20.960]
And then you can be down to random about 015 20 minutes.

[01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:21.860]
You're like, oh, that's okay.

[01:07:21.980 --> 01:07:22.640]
I'm going to hit something big.

[01:07:23.020 --> 01:07:23.500]
And then you don't.

[01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:25.260]
You might not lose a 5 grand or something like that.

[01:07:26.860 --> 01:07:31.440]
From 169 votes on the pool, well we got it easily made for like I said, 14.

[01:07:31.800 --> 01:07:32.560]
That's all I'm going.

[01:07:32.700 --> 01:07:33.460]
That's the size I'm going.

[01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:39.280]
I don't want to start over-shooting and coming up with ridiculous numbers, especially now that we're in the dog days of almost summer.

[01:07:40.680 --> 01:07:41.260]
It is.

[01:07:41.740 --> 01:07:44.720]
I know I'm the only one that says that, but I don't even feel it.

[01:07:45.220 --> 01:07:45.860]
I feel it.

[01:07:46.100 --> 01:07:50.600]
What's after the Easter Bunny and the pay the pay soft puppet go away, that's it.

[01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:54.480]
Joyce Marcel writes in the common dreams.org.

[01:07:55.060 --> 01:07:56.300]
He gave religion a bad name.

[01:07:56.760 --> 01:07:57.800]
Who do you think she's writing about?

[01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:58.340]
Good guess.

[01:07:58.580 --> 01:07:58.960]
Dead guy.

[01:07:59.620 --> 01:08:02.860]
My well-mannered 89 year old mother taught me not to speak ill of the dead.

[01:08:02.980 --> 01:08:05.880]
She says, but even she was laughing when she heard that Jerry Falwell had died.

[01:08:06.420 --> 01:08:08.500]
I guess not too many people are going to miss him, she said.

[01:08:09.160 --> 01:08:14.740]
Not being a Christian has its advantages, and one of them has been the ability to sit back and watch in disbelief.

[01:08:14.760 --> 01:08:19.600]
As self-serving hypocrites be foul, all that is decent and tender about the Christian religion.

[01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:21.220]
Calumny, what is Calumny?

[01:08:21.380 --> 01:08:21.760]
Calumny.

[01:08:22.300 --> 01:08:22.820]
I don't know.

[01:08:23.940 --> 01:08:25.120]
C-A-L-U-M-N-Y.

[01:08:25.280 --> 01:08:26.320]
I know I'm not pronouncing that right.

[01:08:27.660 --> 01:08:28.300]
What is that?

[01:08:29.440 --> 01:08:30.060]
Google it.

[01:08:30.740 --> 01:08:32.260]
C-A-L-U-M-N-Y.

[01:08:32.360 --> 01:08:33.560]
I know the word, but I don't know what it means.

[01:08:33.880 --> 01:08:34.920]
Remember I were proud of pronouncing.

[01:08:35.060 --> 01:08:36.040]
Jerry Falwell loved it.

[01:08:36.740 --> 01:08:38.520]
Well, if he loved it, we want to know what it is.

[01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:40.260]
Did you look it up?

[01:08:40.740 --> 01:08:40.960]
Looking.

[01:08:42.060 --> 01:08:50.940]
In fact, he'll long be remembered for saying just after 9-11, I really believe that the pagans and the abortionists and the feminists and the gays and lesbians were actively trying to make that an alternative lifestyle.

[01:08:51.140 --> 01:08:54.780]
The AC and U people for the American way, all of them have tried to secularize America.

[01:08:55.160 --> 01:08:57.860]
I put the finger in their face and say, you help this happen.

[01:08:58.080 --> 01:08:58.800]
What is Calumny?

[01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:02.960]
It's a fault and malicious statement designed to enter the reputation of someone or something.

[01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:03.920]
That was him.

[01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:09.300]
Furious, the director of the National G&L's being tasked for its laurel's jawn demanded an apology.

[01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:15.920]
The terrible tragedy that's been fallen our nation and indeed the entire global community is the said by product of fanaticism that she said,

[01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:24.040]
it has its roots in the same fanaticism that enables people like Jerry Falwell to preach hate against those who don't think love or live in the exact same way he does.

[01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:28.760]
As soon as he was called out, even the White House rebuked him, Falwell is all bullies due back down.

[01:09:28.760 --> 01:09:35.760]
He told CNN, I would never blame any human beings except the terrorists and if I left the impression with gays or lesbians or anyone else, I apologize.

[01:09:36.300 --> 01:09:36.620]
Right.

[01:09:37.660 --> 01:09:42.940]
Remember the Bible talking about those without sin-catching the first stone and about mercy and loving kindness, not this guy?

[01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:50.260]
AIDS is not just God's punishment for homosexuals, it is God's punishment for the society that tolerates homosexuals, he said.

[01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:55.180]
And when a gay church came close to being accepted into the World Council of Churches, Falwell said,

[01:09:55.180 --> 01:10:01.320]
thank God this violence-atonic system will one day be utterly annihilated because there will be a celebration in heaven.

[01:10:02.780 --> 01:10:08.100]
How many angry and deluded people use Falwell's words as permission to commit violence? How much blood was on Falwell's hands?

[01:10:08.940 --> 01:10:15.160]
Does Shalt not kill? Not one of Falwell's favorite commandments. We visit prisoners on death row and some of them are saved,

[01:10:15.160 --> 01:10:21.020]
but we believe their sentences should be carried out because they have a debt to society, he said. Respect for women, not a chance.

[01:10:21.720 --> 01:10:33.660]
It appears that America's antibiblical feminist movement is at last dying, thank God, and it's possibly being replaced by a Christ-centered men's movement which may become the foundation for a desperately-need national spiritual awakening he said.

[01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:46.380]
Another time he said, I don't believe the homosexual community deserves minority status, one's misbehavior does not qualify him or her for minority status, blacks, Hispanics, women, etc., or God ordained minorities who do indeed deserve minority status.

[01:10:47.340 --> 01:10:54.000]
Well, that's just ignorant, Reverend Falwell, women are the majority on the planet, and we're certainly majority in the USA, maybe that's what God ordained.

[01:10:55.520 --> 01:10:59.540]
Falwell triggers prejudices to such an extreme that at times you wondered if the man was sane.

[01:11:00.980 --> 01:11:06.640]
Take this quote about the American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU is to Christians with the American Nazi Party is to Jews.

[01:11:07.800 --> 01:11:13.700]
All those ACLU concentration camps with their poisoned showers and cream of trams, how have they managed to hide them so well she asks?

[01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:20.840]
And speaking of its stupidity, the whole global warming thing is created in the Stray America's free enterprise system and our economic stability, he said.

[01:11:22.500 --> 01:11:24.400]
He said, rhymes with, he's still dead.

[01:11:25.440 --> 01:11:32.320]
Falwell was not as he claimed to theologian when you examine his belief system, it becomes evident that his God wasn't God or Jesus, it was only the status quo.

[01:11:33.180 --> 01:11:41.820]
He supported patriarchy, gave him his power, he supported capitalism as though God had a preferred economic policy, he supported the death penalty because we avenged as easier than turning the other cheek.

[01:11:42.280 --> 01:11:48.760]
He supported the destruction of the environment because he couldn't even think so far of the box as to treasure the Garden of Eden and be concerned about its falling.

[01:11:49.580 --> 01:11:56.520]
Anti-Semitism, the Jews are returned to their land of unbelief, they're spiritually blind and desperately need of their Messiah and Savior, he said.

[01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:00.140]
Another time he announced that the anti-Christ is alive and living as a Jewish male.

[01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:06.040]
No Falwell was not a man of God, Falwell was a snake-oral salesman, a hustler of the first ward at water.

[01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:16.520]
It must be so good to be able to hate like that, to be so self-righteous, so egotistical, so proud, so sure of your own damn small-minded prejudices that you feel no shame and attributing them to God himself.

[01:12:17.380 --> 01:12:23.480]
Bowies, hustlers, hypocrites, fanatics, and the rest of the rats who hide behind the Bible must be called out, Falwell is only one of a pack.

[01:12:23.920 --> 01:12:26.400]
Pat Robertson is another, George W. Bush is one too.

[01:12:26.840 --> 01:12:28.020]
We ought to get the bill done.

[01:12:28.620 --> 01:12:31.160]
There may be two many to name and don't forget their followers.

[01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:43.540]
All hiding behind Christianity in the pursuit of power entrusted only in their own self-aggrandizement, all ignorant, all uncreative, all lacking in empathy, all having to pick on those they perceive as weaker than themselves, all indifferent to the pain of others.

[01:12:44.340 --> 01:12:52.060]
There are many moral Christians in this world, as there are many moral Jews, moral Muslims, and moral atheists, people like Jerry Falwell give religion a bad name.

[01:12:53.100 --> 01:12:54.700]
In other words, Hubben and Dread.

[01:12:55.360 --> 01:13:00.900]
And that's where he is for sure if there's such a place as Dread. You know where Dread is? Right over there I imagine.

[01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:05.160]
Right. Right down the road. And probably in South Florida pretty and close.

[01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:12.160]
When you've come to South Florida, baby, you know there is such a place as hell. That's why so damn hot and so humid. Steamy.

[01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:17.880]
And that's why those hurricanes and all other crap keeps tornadoes, stuff like that. The big blow.

[01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:25.160]
Maybe it's Joyce. Yeah, because I heard she blows. That's the rumor going wrong. I have to hear that again like after the break.

[01:13:26.020 --> 01:13:27.720]
Shuttle shun. Shuttle shun.

[01:13:27.720 --> 01:13:27.780]
Shuttle shun.

[01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:31.620]
On 560 W. G.A.M. Miami Fort Laudale.

[01:13:31.820 --> 01:13:33.100]
Cockhead or Diddy Cockhead.

[01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:35.620]
Ain't no farts out anymore.

[01:13:36.860 --> 01:13:41.940]
Boy. Ain't no farts out like before.

[01:13:43.060 --> 01:13:43.260]
Huh?

[01:13:44.820 --> 01:13:48.200]
Ain't no farts out anymore.

[01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:51.320]
Boy. Some sneaky corporate hoe.

[01:13:51.700 --> 01:13:52.600]
Name Joyce.

[01:13:52.980 --> 01:13:53.920]
Took them away.

[01:13:56.080 --> 01:13:57.040]
Absolutely.

[01:13:57.520 --> 01:13:58.160]
Can't say.

[01:13:58.940 --> 01:13:59.900]
Now.

[01:14:03.020 --> 01:14:06.340]
I'll be cause of some bitch now.

[01:14:09.640 --> 01:14:12.580]
Just to bring the ratings down.

[01:14:13.220 --> 01:14:15.080]
She don't want me around.

[01:14:15.780 --> 01:14:18.480]
And that's why she took them away.

[01:14:20.780 --> 01:14:31.480]
And she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, you blow.

[01:14:33.480 --> 01:14:58.700]
She blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows

[01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:28.540]
She blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows

[01:16:04.720 --> 01:16:17.860]
She blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows

[01:16:17.860 --> 01:16:47.800]
On the Daniel Crocs, what would be your response? 181 votes. He died doing what he wanted to do, 383. He was a lovely human being, blah, blah, who's in the world? 279. Nanya, as a Nanya business Georgia being there. He's getting the piece. I still keep thinking of that scene in Godfather 2, were there on the in Havana? Oh yeah, but they can't. On the roof of that casino hotel. And Hyman Roth is going talking about how they're splitting up all the

[01:16:47.800 --> 01:17:17.780]
goodies there and a piece for the you know, to tire of the piece, and of course, he's eating a piece of cake. Right. How many scenes there are all through the Godfather, the three movies? Right. Cake is very important. Cake seems to be very big, and of course Michael is a diabetic. And I mean, really badly diabetic. And obviously a type one diabetic because he's not fat. And he has that diabetic coma that he goes or I don't know what it was, was it a stroke or whatever he went and it was a seizure of some sort. Yeah. Seasures. Seasures. I'm a

[01:17:17.780 --> 01:17:19.760]
That's what the Mafia does. They seize your goods.

[01:17:20.060 --> 01:17:20.640]
The government.

[01:17:20.820 --> 01:17:21.680]
Somebody would seize migrants.

[01:17:22.300 --> 01:17:24.480]
He was the lovely human being, but who's in the world 279?

[01:17:24.760 --> 01:17:27.040]
He's in that big radio station in the sky, 188.

[01:17:27.660 --> 01:17:29.980]
He's acting on Jesus right now, 125.

[01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:30.900]
Are you sure?

[01:17:31.780 --> 01:17:33.560]
He died a free man, no wife, 104.

[01:17:34.120 --> 01:17:35.980]
Go let George talk to all you people out of getting married.

[01:17:36.240 --> 01:17:37.560]
Okay? There's a few good marriages.

[01:17:37.860 --> 01:17:38.920]
This is a real loves company. Go ahead.

[01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:39.840]
I want everybody to go get married.

[01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:41.180]
He was adorable, 99.

[01:17:41.540 --> 01:17:45.840]
He was a rotten bastard. Good ridden 74, 5.7% of the whole audience.

[01:17:45.840 --> 01:17:48.180]
Think I'm a rotten bastard. I should only croak.

[01:17:48.380 --> 01:17:49.460]
Well, how do you like their maples?

[01:17:49.760 --> 01:17:50.800]
Run to the core.

[01:17:51.220 --> 01:17:52.580]
Just like South Florida, baby.

[01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:53.360]
Rotten.

[01:17:54.120 --> 01:17:54.920]
Keep a palamon.

[01:17:55.080 --> 01:17:55.360]
I don't care.

[01:17:55.980 --> 01:17:57.440]
I'm still getting paid a crap load of money.

[01:17:58.040 --> 01:18:00.460]
See, they do that because they think that it's going to aggravate.

[01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:01.780]
Oh, yeah, we're going to get it.

[01:18:01.900 --> 01:18:02.540]
I couldn't care.

[01:18:02.620 --> 01:18:05.780]
If we had 7,000 votes saying I'm a rotten bastard, good riddance,

[01:18:06.160 --> 01:18:10.260]
do you think it would make even a teeny tiny, we need a bit of difference to me?

[01:18:10.440 --> 01:18:10.580]
No.

[01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:12.340]
But I don't care.

[01:18:12.340 --> 01:18:12.880]
Huh.

[01:18:13.380 --> 01:18:16.240]
That's one of the reasons I'm a rotten bastard, is I refuse to care.

[01:18:16.460 --> 01:18:20.800]
I don't live my life or do the show or anything else in my life to please a bunch of strangers.

[01:18:21.320 --> 01:18:22.740]
That's not how it works.

[01:18:24.040 --> 01:18:26.560]
All these experts, they all experts on everything.

[01:18:27.460 --> 01:18:28.140]
And they know nothing.

[01:18:29.100 --> 01:18:30.080]
Hey, run.

[01:18:31.060 --> 01:18:34.300]
I know he's up there looking down on us, 29, 1283 votes.

[01:18:34.400 --> 01:18:36.260]
We'll go over 1,300 by the top of this tower.

[01:18:36.260 --> 01:18:37.160]
We got two hours to go.

[01:18:37.480 --> 01:18:39.320]
14 is a given.

[01:18:40.200 --> 01:18:41.340]
And Chris is sitting in there.

[01:18:41.420 --> 01:18:42.540]
Well, what about 1350?

[01:18:42.880 --> 01:18:45.780]
That's what happens when your blood sugar is so high, you can barely think straight.

[01:18:45.900 --> 01:18:46.600]
That's what happens.

[01:18:47.160 --> 01:18:50.160]
Actually, I was just trying to make sure you didn't shoot too high and then you started feeling bad about it.

[01:18:59.920 --> 01:19:01.440]
I'll tell you what, stand up straight.

[01:19:02.380 --> 01:19:03.840]
I hope I didn't shoot too high.

[01:19:04.820 --> 01:19:05.080]
Okay.

[01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:07.420]
Because I wouldn't want to do anything that went over your head.

[01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:10.800]
Jeff Cohen, not the one from the pizza joint.

[01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.800]
Jeff Cohen writes, he's a regular writer on CommonDreams.org.

[01:19:14.440 --> 01:19:15.640]
And he makes a lot of sense.

[01:19:15.680 --> 01:19:21.280]
He's founder of MediaWatch Group Fear and former TV puttin producer and author of cable news confidential,

[01:19:21.460 --> 01:19:22.780]
and my misadventures in the corporate media.

[01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:25.840]
We've had many of his pieces over the period of time.

[01:19:27.060 --> 01:19:28.020]
Fall well in me, he writes.

[01:19:28.360 --> 01:19:30.280]
You're not going to read a whole bunch of nasty stuff about a dead guy.

[01:19:30.420 --> 01:19:30.560]
Are you?

[01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:30.780]
Yes.

[01:19:31.640 --> 01:19:36.220]
He says it was fitting to see so much gushing on TV news about the reverend jury of fall while an hour's after his death.

[01:19:36.220 --> 01:19:38.460]
He and TV news held the same thing sacred.

[01:19:38.820 --> 01:19:41.300]
Fame, sound bites, and uninformed fear mongering.

[01:19:42.180 --> 01:19:46.580]
At the beginning of his rise 25 years ago, it was his mainstream media complicity and co-obility

[01:19:46.580 --> 01:19:49.880]
that helped build a fall while's moral majority and the myth of its clout.

[01:19:50.520 --> 01:19:53.680]
As documented in Tina Rosenberg's 1980 to watch the monthly piece,

[01:19:54.020 --> 01:19:55.520]
How the Media Made the Moral Majority,

[01:19:55.980 --> 01:20:00.280]
Team Fall well repeatedly violated the ninth commandment by misleading journalists about their numbers in power.

[01:20:01.160 --> 01:20:05.080]
Despite hundreds of outlandersly inactive and uninformed and bigoted comments over the years,

[01:20:05.080 --> 01:20:08.500]
not just the three you may have heard last night, meaning a Tuesday night.

[01:20:09.300 --> 01:20:11.740]
Fall or Mayday respected fixture in TV news.

[01:20:12.040 --> 01:20:16.020]
The TV producers friend he didn't even know much about the topic to say yes to the invitation.

[01:20:17.080 --> 01:20:20.860]
In Ferris' exhaustive study of ABC Nightlines guest list during the mid-1980s,

[01:20:21.300 --> 01:20:23.100]
Fall well was one of the show's most frequent guests.

[01:20:23.520 --> 01:20:27.440]
He offered his expertise about homosexuality in one episode and about AIDS on another.

[01:20:28.100 --> 01:20:33.360]
Fall well saw AIDS as a holy punishment of gays and once asked by people with AIDS were not quarantined like infected cattle.

[01:20:34.440 --> 01:20:38.800]
My only direct experiences with Fall well were fittingly with Fall well the TV pundit.

[01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:41.680]
We did battle high at TV studios as natural habitat.

[01:20:42.140 --> 01:20:46.640]
As a paid pundit MSNBC in 2002, I had colorful on air debates with Fall well,

[01:20:46.960 --> 01:20:48.620]
described in my book cable news confidential.

[01:20:49.500 --> 01:20:54.040]
When I debated Fall well in 2002 and whether to invade Iraq, he put it his pudgy finger at Sodom who's saying

[01:20:54.040 --> 01:20:56.140]
it's having been involved in the 9-11 attacks.

[01:20:57.080 --> 01:21:03.220]
Fall well was a Republican team player, blaming 9-11 on Sodom was now more important than blaming it on feminist gays in the ACLU.

[01:21:03.220 --> 01:21:04.740]
As he did on September 13.

[01:21:05.840 --> 01:21:12.580]
During another MSNBC debate we had on the separation of church and state, Fall well was in fine form and in love with his own voice.

[01:21:13.220 --> 01:21:15.780]
March a public education today he entoned his designer creating,

[01:21:16.380 --> 01:21:19.040]
atheistic society that totally repudiates our religious heritage,

[01:21:19.400 --> 01:21:21.320]
this is a nation under God, he said.

[01:21:21.520 --> 01:21:22.120]
Dear God!

[01:21:22.920 --> 01:21:26.300]
Near the end of the debate are we stated a point that open with that Fall well had not answered.

[01:21:26.900 --> 01:21:31.200]
Reverend Fall well, if our nation under God, it's interesting that the founders of our Constitution, our framers,

[01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:34.500]
didn't even put the word God in the Constitution, that was by design.

[01:21:35.560 --> 01:21:39.000]
You haven't read it very clearly, Fall well responded, let me correct you on that.

[01:21:39.260 --> 01:21:42.620]
The Constitution is dated 1787 and the year of our Lord.

[01:21:43.680 --> 01:21:47.200]
He slowed down to an unseated, each precious word considering a gotcha moment.

[01:21:48.040 --> 01:21:51.240]
Fall well, and I work on the split screen as he sternly pointed his finger at me,

[01:21:51.320 --> 01:21:53.860]
I shook my head, facing my hands in disbelief.

[01:21:54.500 --> 01:21:57.080]
The debate closed with Fall well continuing to a big finale.

[01:21:57.080 --> 01:22:00.920]
The separation of church and state is a myth to clear the preacher like global warming.

[01:22:01.980 --> 01:22:05.180]
We were now on split screen with me laughing at the ignorance I just heard.

[01:22:05.420 --> 01:22:08.800]
Fall well appeared very self-satisfied over his pro-God and the environment, too far.

[01:22:10.080 --> 01:22:14.360]
Four years after the factually challenged Reverend continued as a TV punitive by contrast,

[01:22:14.620 --> 01:22:17.640]
I was silenced for political reasons as the Iraq war neared.

[01:22:18.260 --> 01:22:24.060]
With immediate cheerleading for war, the last thing TV news wanted was so-burnt accurate caution about the impact of an Iraq invasion.

[01:22:24.060 --> 01:22:26.920]
TV prefers the far-walls and encoders in Frank Gathnes.

[01:22:27.640 --> 01:22:32.080]
Instead of so much gushing about how far-wall had involved values of voters in our democracy,

[01:22:32.400 --> 01:22:35.360]
it would be nice to see some interest fresh from TV news about its own rule,

[01:22:35.700 --> 01:22:38.620]
enforcing factually challenged right-wing bigots on the American public

[01:22:38.620 --> 01:22:40.940]
to the new exclusion of informed progressive voices.

[01:22:41.240 --> 01:22:42.620]
Nice going, Jeff Cohen, you row job.

[01:22:43.220 --> 01:22:44.400]
What every name is Jeff, baby.

[01:22:44.800 --> 01:22:45.160]
Joe Mama.

[01:22:46.200 --> 01:22:48.540]
Say I got Joe Bell on the mind because of that vocal Brian situation.

[01:22:48.540 --> 01:22:50.760]
Has anything been straight now because it's almost noon?

[01:22:50.760 --> 01:22:52.460]
I've heard anything new.

[01:22:52.900 --> 01:22:54.060]
What do you mean having anything new?

[01:22:54.160 --> 01:22:56.460]
Clarence hasn't come in there and said the check is in the mail.

[01:22:56.700 --> 01:22:56.760]
No.

[01:22:56.760 --> 01:22:59.160]
The direct deposit is on the way to Chickadek or something like that?

[01:23:00.240 --> 01:23:00.560]
No.

[01:23:00.700 --> 01:23:03.120]
I'm going to tell you something man, there's going to be hell to pay.

[01:23:03.340 --> 01:23:04.700]
I'll get Norma Kent on the case.

[01:23:05.680 --> 01:23:07.540]
Then they'll laugh.

[01:23:08.940 --> 01:23:10.400]
Oh yeah, they really fear him man.

[01:23:10.680 --> 01:23:10.920]
I'll laugh.

[01:23:11.120 --> 01:23:11.400]
I'll hear it out.

[01:23:13.680 --> 01:23:18.160]
I mean this is a guy that went to lunch with Joe Bell the first time when the lunch was over said,

[01:23:18.160 --> 01:23:19.800]
hey that Clarence is a good looking guy.

[01:23:23.020 --> 01:23:24.060]
This is what I got.

[01:23:24.240 --> 01:23:25.440]
Pop had gencles of what I got.

[01:23:25.560 --> 01:23:26.580]
You're fairy.

[01:23:26.940 --> 01:23:30.060]
You're about as ineffectual as a limp noodle although I do like my pasta.

[01:23:30.440 --> 01:23:31.780]
Isn't Salfus out of jail by now?

[01:23:33.460 --> 01:23:34.240]
I would think so.

[01:23:34.480 --> 01:23:35.960]
I might see he's not back in a radio business.

[01:23:36.060 --> 01:23:37.920]
He probably wouldn't have too many prospective clients.

[01:23:39.220 --> 01:23:41.100]
Maybe Sunny Fox would like to accompany him.

[01:23:42.240 --> 01:23:43.280]
Whatever happened to Sunny Fox?

[01:23:43.460 --> 01:23:44.100]
He's still over there.

[01:23:44.700 --> 01:23:45.140]
I can't see.

[01:23:45.140 --> 01:23:45.440]
What was he doing?

[01:23:45.800 --> 01:23:47.900]
The satellite stuff wasn't for one of the channels.

[01:23:48.580 --> 01:23:49.580]
This is Sunny Fox.

[01:23:49.780 --> 01:23:51.680]
I listen to you Rodgers because I can hear the word asked.

[01:23:51.980 --> 01:23:54.000]
Oh well don't say the whole word.

[01:23:54.180 --> 01:23:54.320]
No.

[01:23:55.300 --> 01:23:55.660]
God.

[01:23:56.120 --> 01:23:57.500]
See we can't play that anymore.

[01:23:58.660 --> 01:24:00.060]
Jesus, God Almighty.

[01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:04.140]
Try 86 on the pole and you're giving me a son of an advanced poor Chris.

[01:24:04.300 --> 01:24:06.480]
No matter what he does he can't do the right thing.

[01:24:06.620 --> 01:24:08.480]
It just goes with the territory I guess.

[01:24:09.760 --> 01:24:13.940]
Because when you got that much fat in your body like chokes off the circulation right under your chin.

[01:24:15.640 --> 01:24:16.480]
Right at the neck.

[01:24:17.860 --> 01:24:19.420]
So I bet you the Humphre is going to be on.

[01:24:19.500 --> 01:24:23.920]
I'm sure he is because he's in Baltimore right now for the preekness.

[01:24:25.480 --> 01:24:27.900]
Now if you talk to him, I'm not that I doubt that he'll call.

[01:24:28.020 --> 01:24:32.160]
I'm sure like 11 o'clock tomorrow morning like clockwork Dave Johnson will be on the phone and we'll go through that hole.

[01:24:32.380 --> 01:24:33.660]
I'll have to do a little homework on that tonight.

[01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:35.340]
I haven't spoke to him lately.

[01:24:35.520 --> 01:24:37.740]
After a little homework on the preekness again.

[01:24:39.080 --> 01:24:40.340]
Well I don't know anything about it.

[01:24:40.440 --> 01:24:41.760]
I mean that horse that won the Derby.

[01:24:41.760 --> 01:24:43.760]
What was it street street beat?

[01:24:44.560 --> 01:24:45.340]
What was it?

[01:24:45.420 --> 01:24:47.220]
I don't know what I wasn't paying any attention.

[01:24:47.680 --> 01:24:49.080]
What do you mean we're paying any attention?

[01:24:49.420 --> 01:24:54.180]
He was 19th in the backstretch and he circled a few as Bob Savage would say the late Bob Savage.

[01:24:54.360 --> 01:24:55.940]
He circled the field along the rail.

[01:24:56.140 --> 01:24:56.760]
It's for codgers.

[01:24:57.060 --> 01:24:58.700]
Now how do you circle the field along the rail?

[01:24:58.880 --> 01:24:59.720]
Stop and think about that.

[01:24:59.920 --> 01:25:02.300]
Okay when you're going on the inside, how do you circle the field?

[01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:03.760]
But that's what Bob Savage used to say.

[01:25:05.180 --> 01:25:06.880]
He turned out to be a pretty good guy you know.

[01:25:07.560 --> 01:25:07.860]
No.

[01:25:08.240 --> 01:25:08.420]
I don't know.

[01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:11.080]
And he married a big tall, a very wealthy lady.

[01:25:11.920 --> 01:25:12.600]
In Chicago.

[01:25:12.940 --> 01:25:13.400]
Good for him.

[01:25:13.800 --> 01:25:14.760]
Yeah good for him is right.

[01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:15.400]
You know I'm legit.

[01:25:15.540 --> 01:25:16.060]
You short guys.

[01:25:16.060 --> 01:25:17.860]
You always find big tall broads.

[01:25:17.920 --> 01:25:21.020]
Of course your wife isn't wealthy and that's on point.

[01:25:21.300 --> 01:25:21.640]
I'm sorry.

[01:25:22.220 --> 01:25:22.460]
Very sad.

[01:25:22.900 --> 01:25:23.540]
That's all in here.

[01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:26.240]
And you sure aren't going to make it or her wealthy.

[01:25:26.420 --> 01:25:26.560]
Nope.

[01:25:27.040 --> 01:25:28.620]
That's one good thing you got going.

[01:25:28.980 --> 01:25:29.620]
Oh yeah that's good.

[01:25:30.080 --> 01:25:31.540]
Because revenge is always sweet.

[01:25:31.720 --> 01:25:33.820]
You know at least you're not going to leave no big amount of money.

[01:25:33.900 --> 01:25:34.500]
I like a lot of guys.

[01:25:34.600 --> 01:25:35.620]
They leave all that money in their will.

[01:25:36.720 --> 01:25:39.100]
And then people that have intruded all that well during their life.

[01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:39.840]
I have a lot of money.

[01:25:39.840 --> 01:25:40.900]
I just leave my case.

[01:25:41.020 --> 01:25:42.900]
I'm leaving only to people who have treated me well.

[01:25:43.180 --> 01:25:43.400]
I see.

[01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:45.180]
In spite of what you're thinking.

[01:25:45.920 --> 01:25:46.240]
Right.

[01:25:46.640 --> 01:25:48.820]
Because you have certain prejudices against your friends.

[01:25:49.060 --> 01:25:50.520]
I don't want to mention any of course.

[01:25:50.640 --> 01:25:50.740]
No.

[01:25:51.340 --> 01:25:53.640]
In particular because there's no idea how you've been treated.

[01:25:53.740 --> 01:25:55.200]
I would be like talking behind their back.

[01:25:55.400 --> 01:25:55.520]
Right.

[01:25:56.740 --> 01:25:58.940]
You don't know what anyone is saying behind your back.

[01:25:59.560 --> 01:25:59.920]
Reality.

[01:26:00.140 --> 01:26:00.680]
And you know what?

[01:26:00.800 --> 01:26:01.500]
I really don't care.

[01:26:01.880 --> 01:26:03.300]
As long as I don't find out.

[01:26:03.500 --> 01:26:03.660]
That's good.

[01:26:03.820 --> 01:26:04.120]
You don't care.

[01:26:04.460 --> 01:26:06.300]
And don't be making up any more stories either.

[01:26:06.440 --> 01:26:06.580]
Right.

[01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:08.380]
Well listen.

[01:26:08.540 --> 01:26:09.720]
You know, that's what you were telling everybody.

[01:26:09.720 --> 01:26:11.220]
You wanted my will and now you got it.

[01:26:11.300 --> 01:26:11.420]
Oh, that's it.

[01:26:12.300 --> 01:26:12.820]
Did you hear?

[01:26:13.800 --> 01:26:16.340]
Oh, there he goes again with that inside stuff with George.

[01:26:16.500 --> 01:26:18.100]
We can't take it.

[01:26:18.100 --> 01:26:21.940]
Now, was that from the same goofball from that record LLP and Philadelphia?

[01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:22.720]
That photo guy.

[01:26:23.460 --> 01:26:24.380]
That Adam guy.

[01:26:24.580 --> 01:26:27.060]
We haven't heard from him since I read his first name on the air.

[01:26:27.160 --> 01:26:28.180]
I mentioned you know something from the email.

[01:26:28.460 --> 01:26:29.460]
I think he learned his lesson.

[01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:31.060]
Well, Adam, when he came to Kara.

[01:26:31.200 --> 01:26:33.920]
I just, when I found that other one that was sitting right up here.

[01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:34.900]
The one from the day before.

[01:26:35.520 --> 01:26:41.360]
Also long, long, solid dance about all these air checks and the WIWD.

[01:26:41.900 --> 01:26:46.540]
And if I know you're hosting a different one, you sounded so alive and I'd be laughing and joking with the colors in those days.

[01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:49.220]
Well, maybe I was alive and joking, but that's 100 years ago.

[01:26:49.300 --> 01:26:49.460]
Yeah.

[01:26:49.680 --> 01:26:50.600]
And we had a color something.

[01:26:51.100 --> 01:26:52.300]
A lot of people sounded alive 100 years ago now they're dead.

[01:26:52.400 --> 01:26:54.140]
At least I'm, at least I still sound alive.

[01:26:55.360 --> 01:26:56.080]
I'll say that.

[01:26:56.200 --> 01:26:59.340]
I ain't doing no Don I'm a snowmobile with that beheaded hole and stuff like that.

[01:26:59.460 --> 01:27:01.280]
Oh, we got bitch who's what I mean, Joyce.

[01:27:01.820 --> 01:27:02.300]
Excuse me.

[01:27:05.240 --> 01:27:06.760]
That's just changed your name to bitch.

[01:27:06.840 --> 01:27:07.660]
That'd be a good idea.

[01:27:08.080 --> 01:27:09.500]
Sure, rhymes with their last name.

[01:27:10.980 --> 01:27:11.580]
Bitch, bitch.

[01:27:12.140 --> 01:27:12.700]
I like it.

[01:27:12.760 --> 01:27:13.440]
It's got a good ring to it.

[01:27:13.480 --> 01:27:13.580]
Right.

[01:27:13.780 --> 01:27:14.420]
Probably not.

[01:27:14.600 --> 01:27:18.040]
When we come back after the breakaway number over 1300 and then Chris is going to like a polo jar.

[01:27:21.220 --> 01:27:23.740]
What's the biggest personality?

[01:27:27.300 --> 01:27:28.200]
A 40 or 50?

[01:27:28.600 --> 01:27:28.600]

[01:27:29.440 --> 01:27:30.420]
She way out.

[01:27:31.200 --> 01:27:32.200]
This is great equipment.

[01:27:32.200 --> 01:27:36.300]
Whenever I shape my phone, I listen to the Neil Rogers 12-1 hour.

[01:27:36.300 --> 01:27:36.720]
Right.

[01:27:42.720 --> 01:27:46.220]
She got the lowest ratings on the evening news.

[01:27:46.580 --> 01:27:49.180]
Even looking free runs up, she's loose.

[01:27:49.860 --> 01:27:52.560]
See me, I think that he knows that feeling is thick.

[01:27:53.040 --> 01:27:55.660]
Nobody is watching TV, correct?

[01:27:55.980 --> 01:27:56.120]
No.

[01:27:56.380 --> 01:27:59.100]
That's why I remember that he's a cool man in the back.

[01:27:59.100 --> 01:28:02.600]
But she can't be happy because she's way in the back.

[01:28:03.040 --> 01:28:05.620]
Bitch, she wants to bet your head in with a prick.

[01:28:06.180 --> 01:28:08.880]
Nobody is watching TV, correct?

[01:28:09.740 --> 01:28:13.300]
Can he get me dancing, I will ya'll.

[01:28:16.080 --> 01:28:19.840]
Found him down the pesto and the pso.

[01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:25.520]
And she went to she never looked into the show.

[01:28:25.520 --> 01:28:28.980]
Come back to me as she said and I'll come to know.

[01:28:29.340 --> 01:28:31.980]
Find spot break friends that's better numbers on neck.

[01:28:32.600 --> 01:28:35.100]
Nobody is watching TV, correct?

[01:28:35.540 --> 01:28:36.460]
Oh, can he?

[01:28:37.220 --> 01:28:39.880]
One news, lady, can he?

[01:28:40.620 --> 01:28:43.200]
Future, shady, can he?

[01:28:43.680 --> 01:28:45.640]
One news, can he?

[01:28:45.640 --> 01:28:48.300]
Nobody is watching TV, correct?

[01:28:49.080 --> 01:28:52.380]
No, you long as more people watching.

[01:28:55.520 --> 01:28:59.500]
People rather hear some giant say.

[01:29:00.380 --> 01:29:04.840]
Boy, she's meanin' at the almost-cars TV, yeah.

[01:29:05.240 --> 01:29:08.160]
She can follow the crew by a real and straight.

[01:29:08.620 --> 01:29:11.460]
Crazy little earring wearing Luna's neck.

[01:29:12.060 --> 01:29:14.620]
Nobody is watching TV, correct?

[01:29:15.460 --> 01:29:18.640]
He also can't be pretty good.

[01:29:20.100 --> 01:29:20.360]
Oh.

[01:29:20.360 --> 01:29:24.560]
Oh, man, I guess they went to heaven and I'm back.

[01:29:24.960 --> 01:29:27.900]
Cause they need a light of flingin' things on track.

[01:29:28.500 --> 01:29:31.020]
But if they can't get him, I might hell instead.

[01:29:31.580 --> 01:29:34.400]
Cause nobody is watching TV, correct?

[01:29:35.560 --> 01:29:38.320]
Who's down right to the sentiment?

[01:29:38.900 --> 01:29:40.940]
Down, down, down, wait, down.

[01:29:42.160 --> 01:29:45.000]
Nobody's watching TV, correct?

[01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:47.520]
Down, down, wait, down.

[01:29:49.840 --> 01:29:51.020]
I just love it.

[01:29:51.280 --> 01:29:53.740]
I love what he does, they're like, he ran out of material.

[01:29:54.100 --> 01:29:55.420]
Kinda like that.

[01:29:56.580 --> 01:29:58.140]
13 of the revolts by the way in a pool.

[01:29:59.540 --> 01:30:01.640]
Now, do you have any doubts that we'll get to 14, Chris?

[01:30:02.860 --> 01:30:03.400]
No doubts.

[01:30:04.160 --> 01:30:04.320]
Okay.

[01:30:05.060 --> 01:30:07.340]
Well, let's go off our 13-0-2 before we-

[01:30:07.340 --> 01:30:10.080]
Okay, you're right, we gotta get to 30-0-2 before we get to 1400.

[01:30:10.940 --> 01:30:12.880]
I mean, what is your- what differences does it really make?

[01:30:13.120 --> 01:30:14.980]
You know what I'm thinking about playing sometime this hour?

[01:30:18.360 --> 01:30:19.480]
I'm just thinking about it.

[01:30:19.520 --> 01:30:21.480]
I'm not sure if you're in seeing or promising, but-

[01:30:21.480 --> 01:30:23.800]
Right, you know, fun sounds like me, but-

[01:30:23.800 --> 01:30:29.120]
Be proud, but it's just going through my mind, especially since we're talking so much about poor chicken, I spoke of Brian today.

[01:30:29.420 --> 01:30:31.120]
And the fact that this company don't wanna pay him.

[01:30:32.760 --> 01:30:36.120]
I mean, they owe him for like March and for April and for like half a May.

[01:30:36.380 --> 01:30:37.980]
And they're just stallin' and ston' on.

[01:30:38.320 --> 01:30:43.660]
Did you go back in and see currents and revisit and find out what happened with his email to corporate to counting over there?

[01:30:43.660 --> 01:30:44.640]
To girl in Beasley?

[01:30:44.980 --> 01:30:45.140]
No.

[01:30:45.520 --> 01:30:46.680]
To the measly Beasley?

[01:30:46.780 --> 01:30:47.640]
You don't wanna pay people?

[01:30:47.840 --> 01:30:48.080]
No.

[01:30:49.160 --> 01:30:52.600]
Cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap.

[01:30:52.800 --> 01:30:55.920]
And there are people out there saying, well, the money they're paying you, how can you call them cheap?

[01:30:56.140 --> 01:30:58.820]
Yeah, that's because I make an emmelod of money and have been for almost 10 years now.

[01:30:58.880 --> 01:31:01.380]
That's why, not because they like me, because they're responsible.

[01:31:01.760 --> 01:31:04.800]
Because if they did stop paying me, I tell them we're just stuffin'.

[01:31:04.800 --> 01:31:06.660]
And I think Boca-Brian oughta tell them to stuff it.

[01:31:07.580 --> 01:31:09.060]
But keeps sending me good stuff in though.

[01:31:09.340 --> 01:31:09.480]
Right.

[01:31:10.320 --> 01:31:12.420]
No, listen, we can't afford to be without his crap.

[01:31:12.820 --> 01:31:13.080]
Right, I'll...

[01:31:13.080 --> 01:31:16.920]
Just that one bit alone, no more farts on, just that alone.

[01:31:17.500 --> 01:31:19.640]
It's gonna take about half of the show all next week.

[01:31:19.880 --> 01:31:21.540]
In fact, you know something is a protest tomorrow.

[01:31:22.100 --> 01:31:24.280]
What I'll do, I think, I'm gonna play that all day.

[01:31:24.560 --> 01:31:24.860]
All right.

[01:31:25.100 --> 01:31:28.520]
If they don't pay him, if they don't make arrangements to take care of him, I'm gonna play that just all day.

[01:31:28.940 --> 01:31:30.440]
We'll get the spots on and that's it.

[01:31:31.760 --> 01:31:35.680]
Everything that sounds like a plan, 1303, and a poll, by the way, we're kicking ass, baby.

[01:31:35.960 --> 01:31:36.620]
In spite of them.

[01:31:37.080 --> 01:31:40.720]
In spite of these losers and abusers and boosers and...

[01:31:40.720 --> 01:31:44.120]
Oh, God Almighty, that's what happens when you work for Goyam.

[01:31:45.960 --> 01:31:48.740]
So I'm looking at the appeal for the Pimlico street sense.

[01:31:48.880 --> 01:31:50.620]
I thought the horse was called street meat.

[01:31:50.960 --> 01:31:52.740]
He probably will be if he doesn't run good in the pregness.

[01:31:54.480 --> 01:31:56.340]
Now, where is it that they eat horses in Japan?

[01:31:57.720 --> 01:31:58.760]
Uh, China?

[01:31:59.260 --> 01:32:00.960]
How does it China? Well, China they eat everything.

[01:32:01.180 --> 01:32:02.060]
I mean, you know, let's think of it.

[01:32:02.060 --> 01:32:02.060]

[01:32:02.460 --> 01:32:03.800]
If it moves or ever did move.

[01:32:03.980 --> 01:32:04.440]
I told you about...

[01:32:04.440 --> 01:32:04.780]
Oh, great.

[01:32:04.780 --> 01:32:06.080]
It's also supposedly...

[01:32:06.080 --> 01:32:08.860]
I told you about going to that Chinese market on Spadina here once in a while.

[01:32:08.880 --> 01:32:09.020]
Yeah.

[01:32:09.200 --> 01:32:09.900]
Oh, my God.

[01:32:10.180 --> 01:32:11.980]
I was looking for that low carb.

[01:32:12.300 --> 01:32:13.040]
I'm scared of that.

[01:32:13.040 --> 01:32:13.780]
That's why I eat pasta.

[01:32:14.300 --> 01:32:17.560]
Oh, man, just the aroma of this stuff in it sort of puts you in a coma.

[01:32:18.200 --> 01:32:20.080]
Tiger's teeth and all this...

[01:32:20.080 --> 01:32:20.440]
Tiger ball.

[01:32:21.040 --> 01:32:22.220]
Right over here.

[01:32:22.520 --> 01:32:23.420]
Nasty crap.

[01:32:24.120 --> 01:32:27.500]
Well, I mean, when you think of crap, you think nasty anyway.

[01:32:28.100 --> 01:32:30.380]
The early lineup for the Pimlico street sense, there we go.

[01:32:30.540 --> 01:32:31.920]
That's gotta be the champion, baby.

[01:32:31.920 --> 01:32:33.060]
Let's pick him.

[01:32:33.180 --> 01:32:37.360]
Like, we always do jump onto Badwagon, like Funny, Fella, and all these other ones.

[01:32:37.380 --> 01:32:38.100]
Funny side.

[01:32:39.640 --> 01:32:40.240]
Street meat.

[01:32:40.420 --> 01:32:41.060]
I mean, street sense.

[01:32:41.540 --> 01:32:45.080]
Hard, did I say that yesterday at the end of the show that any great city has gotta have street meat.

[01:32:45.500 --> 01:32:47.900]
If you go to a city and there's no like vendor selling like, uh,

[01:32:48.360 --> 01:32:50.760]
Brawlers and weeners and stuff like that, it's a crap city.

[01:32:50.900 --> 01:32:51.640]
I'm telling you right now.

[01:32:52.440 --> 01:32:54.620]
That was in a West Palm Beach where they stopped them.

[01:32:54.700 --> 01:32:57.040]
Remember the, uh, Topless Street vendor?

[01:32:58.540 --> 01:32:58.900]
The...

[01:32:58.900 --> 01:33:01.240]
The Thong-wearing hot dog people.

[01:33:01.240 --> 01:33:02.140]
I don't see them anywhere.

[01:33:03.040 --> 01:33:03.240]
Really?

[01:33:03.700 --> 01:33:05.440]
Now I'm talking about a West Palm few years ago.

[01:33:05.500 --> 01:33:07.280]
They have the Topless, uh, I think she was Topless.

[01:33:07.640 --> 01:33:09.820]
Well, whatever she was, they shut her ass down.

[01:33:09.880 --> 01:33:10.620]
And the rest of her too.

[01:33:12.360 --> 01:33:18.180]
Fair, everything is like, we strict and repress and repress and restrict and the blue nose, this and blue nose.

[01:33:18.520 --> 01:33:19.600]
Uh, it just makes me sick.

[01:33:20.200 --> 01:33:21.180]
Street sense, hard spun.

[01:33:21.480 --> 01:33:21.800]
Corlin.

[01:33:23.920 --> 01:33:24.320]
Pufelsberg.

[01:33:24.960 --> 01:33:25.760]
King of the Roxy.

[01:33:26.440 --> 01:33:26.840]
Chalokie.

[01:33:27.740 --> 01:33:28.080]
Exchanger.

[01:33:28.640 --> 01:33:29.320]
CP West.

[01:33:29.500 --> 01:33:31.560]
Flying first by a star race in Minslulup.

[01:33:32.700 --> 01:33:33.040]
Minslulup.

[01:33:33.980 --> 01:33:35.120]
No doubt, King of Seattle.

[01:33:35.420 --> 01:33:35.620]
Slu.

[01:33:35.800 --> 01:33:37.920]
No doubt, see how clever that is, where they name these hot-sits.

[01:33:38.520 --> 01:33:38.860]
Minslulup.

[01:33:39.100 --> 01:33:40.560]
Ah, as opposed to mid-Jule, of course.

[01:33:40.840 --> 01:33:42.740]
That's what they drink at the Freakness and Baltimore.

[01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:43.540]
The mid-Juleps.

[01:33:44.240 --> 01:33:45.340]
Now do you know what a mid-Julep is?

[01:33:45.460 --> 01:33:46.760]
I'm not a drink guy, you know?

[01:33:47.280 --> 01:33:47.820]
Not really, no.

[01:33:48.320 --> 01:33:49.540]
I assume it's got mint in it.

[01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:51.240]
And juleps.

[01:33:51.360 --> 01:33:51.500]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:33:51.500 --> 01:33:52.460]
If you drink it, you're mince.

[01:33:53.780 --> 01:33:54.720]
1311 on that pole.

[01:33:55.140 --> 01:33:56.280]
They can't wait for Neil to croak.

[01:33:56.280 --> 01:33:56.840]
That's okay.

[01:33:57.580 --> 01:33:58.760]
It'll happen one of these days.

[01:33:58.880 --> 01:34:00.720]
And you'll say, oh boy, we sure miss him now.

[01:34:03.280 --> 01:34:04.680]
In fact, why isn't that on there?

[01:34:04.880 --> 01:34:05.060]
Chris.

[01:34:06.100 --> 01:34:07.800]
On the day when Neil croaks won't be your response.

[01:34:08.180 --> 01:34:09.000]
Boy, I sure miss him.

[01:34:09.020 --> 01:34:11.460]
Although I guess that would be assuming that I would work until I would croak.

[01:34:11.540 --> 01:34:12.660]
That's not a good assumption.

[01:34:12.660 --> 01:34:13.300]
Is that a good assumption?

[01:34:14.900 --> 01:34:15.620]
That's an assumption.

[01:34:16.280 --> 01:34:17.880]
Yeah, I think that's a little bit of a stretch.

[01:34:18.080 --> 01:34:19.200]
I don't want to work till I croak.

[01:34:19.240 --> 01:34:20.240]
I don't want to croak on a year.

[01:34:21.060 --> 01:34:23.940]
I don't want to do a Jerry Williams and be like 85 years old and wonder,

[01:34:23.940 --> 01:34:26.040]
how come Walt's table won't put me on the air?

[01:34:26.220 --> 01:34:28.880]
And then he had a heart attack after I talked to him that time.

[01:34:29.340 --> 01:34:29.780]
Jerry Williams.

[01:34:30.360 --> 01:34:31.700]
And he died in the surely there after.

[01:34:31.940 --> 01:34:32.960]
Probably was my fault.

[01:34:33.680 --> 01:34:36.920]
I told him, don't you understand that Walter's table was too face and he's standing in the back

[01:34:36.920 --> 01:34:37.820]
and lying in the end of the box.

[01:34:38.080 --> 01:34:39.260]
And he got just wild.

[01:34:40.120 --> 01:34:40.760]
Just wild.

[01:34:41.040 --> 01:34:45.040]
I mean, how could he be in a business as long as Jerry was and not know that consultants are full of crap?

[01:34:46.300 --> 01:34:48.340]
He was just foaming at the mouth on the phone.

[01:34:48.500 --> 01:34:49.360]
My good buddy, Jerry Williams.

[01:34:49.560 --> 01:34:51.640]
He, uh, nice to me in the back a couple of times too, by the way.

[01:34:52.540 --> 01:34:54.440]
But he's dead now so it doesn't make any difference.

[01:34:54.560 --> 01:34:59.840]
A lot of backstabbers in the business, you know, like Keith Obermann there at MSNBC helping to get I'm as far as the I'm in.

[01:35:02.700 --> 01:35:05.140]
What, what, what do you think Charles is doing the news guy?

[01:35:06.540 --> 01:35:08.200]
Who's, who's asked is he looking now?

[01:35:08.420 --> 01:35:09.300]
Well, I'm in.

[01:35:10.080 --> 01:35:11.100]
I hated him, man.

[01:35:11.180 --> 01:35:11.920]
I couldn't stand him.

[01:35:12.160 --> 01:35:13.480]
I, I don't like butt kisses, you know.

[01:35:13.680 --> 01:35:14.480]
I never liked that McMahon.

[01:35:14.960 --> 01:35:18.700]
And of course, you buddy with the suspenders and the bag and the, uh, squeeze bag.

[01:35:18.860 --> 01:35:19.880]
I'm not too big on him either.

[01:35:21.040 --> 01:35:23.780]
Especially since he lied to me about getting his job at WIOD.

[01:35:24.040 --> 01:35:25.320]
I spoke to Bill Vines, Neil.

[01:35:25.380 --> 01:35:25.820]
It's all set.

[01:35:25.940 --> 01:35:26.500]
You're all set to go.

[01:35:26.540 --> 01:35:28.860]
You're going to be doing seven of them in the, and I never talked to anybody.

[01:35:29.040 --> 01:35:29.720]
Just full of crap.

[01:35:30.620 --> 01:35:37.420]
Larry, you are a compulsive liar and ask us, sir, and a multi-millionaire with a young wife and with lots of making babies.

[01:35:37.660 --> 01:35:39.060]
How old is he about 100 Larry, you think?

[01:35:39.540 --> 01:35:39.800]
At least.

[01:35:40.700 --> 01:35:41.600]
Still making babies.

[01:35:42.740 --> 01:35:47.760]
Oh, here's another skating article about your buddy that just croaked.

[01:35:48.080 --> 01:35:48.820]
Jerry, fall well.

[01:35:48.820 --> 01:35:49.380]
All right.

[01:35:49.720 --> 01:35:51.760]
I thought I took care of most of those, but I got away.

[01:35:51.960 --> 01:35:53.440]
I always have more in my pile, you know.

[01:35:53.960 --> 01:35:57.220]
Because one thing about me, I'm really vile because I've always got more in my pile.

[01:35:58.160 --> 01:36:00.020]
Max Blumenthal, agent of intolerance.

[01:36:00.220 --> 01:36:01.340]
This is a good slice job.

[01:36:03.380 --> 01:36:04.400]
Slices him an ass.

[01:36:05.020 --> 01:36:08.680]
In fact, Larry, and I'm sure Larry did kiss him many, many times because he had him on there all the time.

[01:36:09.060 --> 01:36:11.120]
The more hate-mongering they were, the more he liked him.

[01:36:11.280 --> 01:36:13.060]
Or the more phony they were, like Ross P. Row.

[01:36:13.320 --> 01:36:14.680]
Those are the kind of people that Larry loved.

[01:36:14.900 --> 01:36:15.040]
Uh-huh.

[01:36:15.480 --> 01:36:17.380]
Prop him up there and make him look good on TV.

[01:36:17.680 --> 01:36:20.660]
My good friend, Fidel Castro, you know, I'm surprised he didn't kiss his ass.

[01:36:21.440 --> 01:36:27.220]
And by the way, speaking of that, speaking of Fidel, we don't hear too much about him no more doing.

[01:36:28.060 --> 01:36:28.660]
Not much, no.

[01:36:29.140 --> 01:36:30.260]
No, nothing much to it.

[01:36:31.220 --> 01:36:31.960]
And you want to know why?

[01:36:32.040 --> 01:36:33.720]
Because the party has stopped.

[01:36:34.300 --> 01:36:38.680]
All that street party that was going on and everybody doing the Huchi Kuchi and playing at Celia Cruz music.

[01:36:38.980 --> 01:36:39.340]
Guess what?

[01:36:39.440 --> 01:36:43.660]
It stopped all of a sudden because Hugo Chavez says, hey, Fidel is a dancing a kazaski.

[01:36:43.660 --> 01:36:47.020]
He's doing the Tarantella's, not a Mexican dance Tarantella.

[01:36:47.360 --> 01:36:47.980]
It's on the talent.

[01:36:49.020 --> 01:36:49.900]
Whatever it is.

[01:36:50.360 --> 01:36:51.160]
Oh, look at that.

[01:36:51.160 --> 01:36:53.660]
You buddy Sean, the poor man's personal friend.

[01:36:54.160 --> 01:36:55.100]
Um, whose friend?

[01:36:55.440 --> 01:36:55.860]
My friend.

[01:36:56.400 --> 01:36:58.040]
He says, below is your guy.

[01:36:58.580 --> 01:37:00.500]
Oh, this is a doctor recommendation.

[01:37:00.840 --> 01:37:01.260]
Doctor recommendation.

[01:37:01.260 --> 01:37:02.240]
Doctor, well, thank you Sean.

[01:37:02.480 --> 01:37:03.700]
Old people know all the good doctors.

[01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.260]
He's got a jihadi, name, oh, it's a terrorist doctor.

[01:37:06.360 --> 01:37:06.660]
All right.

[01:37:07.680 --> 01:37:10.620]
He says, professional and sympathetic with top-notch staff and equipment.

[01:37:10.620 --> 01:37:12.920]
And then says, get some exercise, damn your soul.

[01:37:12.920 --> 01:37:16.060]
See all these people are lecturing me and I agree with them.

[01:37:16.380 --> 01:37:16.640]
For one.

[01:37:16.780 --> 01:37:18.160]
Just go and Brandon and the Sean.

[01:37:18.720 --> 01:37:19.220]
You go Sean.

[01:37:20.020 --> 01:37:22.120]
Well, no, they're doing it to cut out of love.

[01:37:22.340 --> 01:37:22.540]
They love it.

[01:37:22.540 --> 01:37:22.920]
That's right.

[01:37:24.920 --> 01:37:26.560]
Sean says, PS, no cracks from George.

[01:37:26.720 --> 01:37:27.780]
My heart rate is 50.

[01:37:28.340 --> 01:37:31.040]
I can run four miles faster than he'll be fired on your return.

[01:37:31.260 --> 01:37:32.760]
It's like, I don't like it.

[01:37:32.920 --> 01:37:35.020]
Oh, man, what a shot.

[01:37:35.240 --> 01:37:36.480]
And then it says just kidding.

[01:37:36.540 --> 01:37:37.080]
We love George.

[01:37:37.100 --> 01:37:37.460]
Yeah.

[01:37:37.700 --> 01:37:38.580]
I'll ring down the stage.

[01:37:38.580 --> 01:37:42.480]
Sean, I can run four miles faster than he'll be fired on your return.

[01:37:42.480 --> 01:37:43.200]
That's a good one.

[01:37:44.300 --> 01:37:46.380]
If we're racing, I want it to be on skates.

[01:37:46.900 --> 01:37:48.420]
What a shot that was, man.

[01:37:48.540 --> 01:37:49.660]
That was a shot through the heart.

[01:37:49.920 --> 01:37:53.560]
Just like, yeah, I'll skate twice as long as it takes your heart to give out, Sean.

[01:37:53.960 --> 01:37:54.140]
Man.

[01:37:54.560 --> 01:37:58.080]
So here's the address of this guy who does have a very jihadi name.

[01:37:58.180 --> 01:37:58.580]
Look at that.

[01:37:59.440 --> 01:38:00.860]
He's a Muslim.

[01:38:01.200 --> 01:38:02.220]
Well, I don't know if he's a Muslim, man.

[01:38:02.320 --> 01:38:03.180]
I've got like a Muslim name.

[01:38:04.080 --> 01:38:04.900]
And he's in Hollywood.

[01:38:05.380 --> 01:38:05.940]
Well, that's interesting.

[01:38:06.500 --> 01:38:06.820]
Cardiologist.

[01:38:06.940 --> 01:38:07.300]
Well, that's good.

[01:38:07.360 --> 01:38:07.840]
Thanks, Sean.

[01:38:08.180 --> 01:38:09.000]
I'm putting that right over here.

[01:38:09.360 --> 01:38:11.040]
So I got one up here and one down there.

[01:38:11.040 --> 01:38:13.100]
And for the time being, I'm not going to go see anybody.

[01:38:13.180 --> 01:38:14.260]
I'll call this guy eventually.

[01:38:15.220 --> 01:38:18.760]
I'll say, you know, my friend, Dr. Borg, and I'm surprised I never got a fax about that

[01:38:18.760 --> 01:38:22.060]
or an email or nothing about what happened to Howard Borg from the Cleveland Clinic.

[01:38:22.060 --> 01:38:24.980]
Maybe he died or retired or maybe opened a private practice.

[01:38:25.780 --> 01:38:28.020]
Or maybe he left town like so many of the doctors in that joint.

[01:38:28.120 --> 01:38:28.880]
All it seemed to do.

[01:38:31.780 --> 01:38:36.060]
Remember the one that was related to the guy from, was it Gary Mills?

[01:38:36.720 --> 01:38:37.280]
I don't even know.

[01:38:37.300 --> 01:38:38.100]
Or was it Gary Sanger?

[01:38:40.040 --> 01:38:41.420]
Whoever was, he wasn't black.

[01:38:41.760 --> 01:38:42.780]
Whoever the guy was, I'm talking about.

[01:38:42.860 --> 01:38:43.340]
He was a crack.

[01:38:43.480 --> 01:38:44.400]
He was a pedantrist.

[01:38:45.360 --> 01:38:47.140]
In fact, he'd like to stick his foot in your...

[01:38:47.140 --> 01:38:47.500]
Blackdome.

[01:38:47.720 --> 01:38:48.140]
Probably good.

[01:38:48.260 --> 01:38:49.080]
We don't remember who he was.

[01:38:49.380 --> 01:38:51.160]
His hand in your wallet and his foot in your...

[01:38:51.160 --> 01:38:51.460]
Blackdome.

[01:38:51.520 --> 01:38:53.020]
And that's not a good combination, believe me.

[01:38:53.840 --> 01:38:55.200]
I mean, if he stuck his hand in your...

[01:38:55.200 --> 01:38:55.500]
Blackdome.

[01:38:55.600 --> 01:38:59.900]
...in his foot in your pocket, that would be interesting to see, okay?

[01:39:02.540 --> 01:39:03.680]
13, 119 votes.

[01:39:04.060 --> 01:39:04.640]
Oh, man.

[01:39:04.780 --> 01:39:05.200]
I'll tell you.

[01:39:05.900 --> 01:39:06.940]
Great Florida doctors.

[01:39:06.940 --> 01:39:08.620]
Well, what a short list that would be.

[01:39:08.620 --> 01:39:11.040]
When it comes to a contagious...

[01:39:11.040 --> 01:39:13.180]
...it makes me a Roger's, you're a Roger's.

[01:39:13.580 --> 01:39:16.400]
4th video, 5th 16th.

[01:39:16.400 --> 01:39:17.400]
He will be a...

[01:39:17.400 --> 01:39:18.120]
...absolutely.

[01:39:19.080 --> 01:39:19.540]
Oi!

[01:39:20.620 --> 01:39:21.680]
Wait, let's go.

[01:39:22.120 --> 01:39:22.580]
Hey.

[01:39:23.140 --> 01:39:24.100]
Aiya, aiya!

[01:39:24.780 --> 01:39:26.100]
Gary's always always.

[01:39:26.920 --> 01:39:27.660]
Aiya, aiya!

[01:39:28.300 --> 01:39:29.500]
Gary's always always.

[01:39:30.540 --> 01:39:31.360]
Aiya, aiya!

[01:39:32.220 --> 01:39:34.000]
Gary's always always.

[01:39:34.200 --> 01:39:34.880]
Aiya, aiya!

[01:39:37.180 --> 01:39:38.100]
Aiya...

[01:39:38.100 --> 01:39:38.300]
Uh, ah!

[01:39:38.960 --> 01:39:40.220]
He'd been a bad hot guy.

[01:39:42.440 --> 01:39:43.700]
Oh, ah.

[01:39:44.340 --> 01:39:45.480]
He was a bad guy.

[01:39:51.200 --> 01:39:54.880]
He's always trying to hit me off.

[01:39:55.540 --> 01:39:56.460]
That's an idiot.

[01:39:56.460 --> 01:39:56.460]

[01:39:56.980 --> 01:39:57.900]
Hecot...

[01:39:59.420 --> 01:40:01.280]
Well, that's...

[01:40:01.280 --> 01:40:01.280]

[01:40:01.660 --> 01:40:02.400]
He's notrai.

[01:40:03.040 --> 01:40:04.140]
What the heck was that?

[01:40:04.140 --> 01:40:04.860]

didn't always relate to abortion and homosexuality nor did they begin there

[01:44:37.380 --> 01:44:40.460]

converted into Thomas Roebath's church this opening episode of fall well's

chroniclers and puzzlingly puzzlingly and glaringly omitted new obituary's

[01:44:58.460 --> 01:45:01.900]
the Washington Post and New York Times is essential to understanding his historical

[01:45:01.900 --> 01:45:06.980]
significance in galvanizing Christian right indeed it was race not abortion or

[01:45:06.980 --> 01:45:10.200]

four years after the Supreme Court's Brown versus Board of Education

[01:45:29.660 --> 01:45:34.500]
integration which if chief justice warranted as associates had known God's

[01:45:34.500 --> 01:45:37.520]
word and the desire to do the Lord's will I'm quite confident the 1954

[01:45:37.520 --> 01:45:41.700]
decision would never have been made he said the facility should be separate when

[01:45:41.700 --> 01:45:45.080]
God is drawn a line of distinction we should not attempt to cross that line

[01:45:49.500 --> 01:45:53.220]
realizes his potential is far better among his own race fall well and under

communist subversive I guess you couldn't call McCommie pinko though

[01:46:35.120 --> 01:46:38.820]
right now after questioning the sincerity intentions of some civil rights

[01:46:38.820 --> 01:46:42.100]
leaders such as Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Mr. James Farmer and others who are

known to have left wing associations fall well declared it is very obvious

[01:46:45.060 --> 01:46:48.240]
that the communists as they do in all parts of the world are taking advantage of

[01:46:48.240 --> 01:46:51.980]
a tense situation in our land and are exploiting every incident to bring about

[01:46:51.980 --> 01:46:55.600]

[01:47:04.400 --> 01:47:08.560]
an institution described by the Lynchburg News in 1966 as a private school for

[01:47:08.560 --> 01:47:13.060]
white students it was one among many so-called SEGA academies created in the

joined the Southern Baptist convention in 96 I've always felt that it was only

after a child was born had a life separate from its mother that it became an

[01:48:15.840 --> 01:48:19.100]
individual person Chris well explain and always has therefore seemed to me

[01:48:19.100 --> 01:48:22.380]
that what is best for the mother in the future should be allowed a year before

[01:48:22.380 --> 01:48:25.940]

better do the break now finish this all right take a breath long man it's long

[01:48:33.960 --> 01:48:36.820]
but it's worth yes it's worth reading because it's not another one he's

[01:48:36.820 --> 01:48:40.740]
ass-looking deals you know every time somebody dies the matter of anxious we

[01:48:40.740 --> 01:48:44.080]
pulse of obnoxious they are the media's got a liquid liquid liquid liquid

[01:48:44.080 --> 01:48:44.420]

[01:49:10.040 --> 01:49:11.620]
an

[01:49:14.160 --> 01:49:15.500]
He gave sign on his head.

[01:49:15.720 --> 01:49:17.000]
It wasn't upside down.

[01:49:17.140 --> 01:49:18.820]
Try angle purple tinky winky.

[01:49:18.980 --> 01:49:21.720]
Upside down, try angle purple tinky winky.

[01:49:21.880 --> 01:49:24.680]
Upside down, try angle purple tinky winky.

[01:49:25.060 --> 01:49:26.320]
Hey, tell it, tell it.

[01:49:26.780 --> 01:49:29.100]
Where, just when I fought things,

[01:49:29.300 --> 01:49:30.060]
couldn't get worse.

[01:49:30.580 --> 01:49:32.940]
I noticed he was carrying a little purse.

[01:49:33.220 --> 01:49:35.900]
Now, how can they call this a children's show?

[01:49:36.340 --> 01:49:38.880]
I may be purple, but I have a brown hole.

[01:49:38.980 --> 01:49:42.300]
He has an upside down, try angle purple tinky winky.

[01:49:42.300 --> 01:49:45.060]
Upside down, try angle purple tinky winky.

[01:49:45.140 --> 01:49:46.680]
I love to dream your balls.

[01:49:46.840 --> 01:49:48.100]
Hey, purple tinky winky.

[01:49:48.500 --> 01:49:49.780]
Hey, tell it, tell it.

[01:49:50.060 --> 01:49:51.220]
Where, where, where, where,

[01:49:51.220 --> 01:49:53.360]
most of out Christian kindness hard to believe?

[01:49:53.640 --> 01:49:56.360]
But on the tell it, tell it's only as a TV screen.

[01:49:56.660 --> 01:49:59.400]
It had a purple tinkers pointing straight at me.

[01:49:59.720 --> 01:50:02.300]
That was blowing an eye through the hole in the thing.

[01:50:13.960 --> 01:50:16.500]
And we can't even get this man pay a few hundred bucks

[01:50:16.500 --> 01:50:17.300]
by the beastlies.

[01:50:17.340 --> 01:50:19.200]
OK, the deadbeat broadcast is man.

[01:50:19.360 --> 01:50:20.180]
That's what they ought to have.

[01:50:20.320 --> 01:50:21.380]
Instead of beastly broadcasting,

[01:50:21.900 --> 01:50:24.120]
it just ought to say deadbeat broadcasting.

[01:50:24.460 --> 01:50:25.020]
On the floor.

[01:50:25.700 --> 01:50:26.020]
That's it.

[01:50:26.940 --> 01:50:28.200]
DBVOG, whatever it is.

[01:50:29.460 --> 01:50:29.860]
Deadbeats.

[01:50:30.400 --> 01:50:31.460]
And of course, this is nothing new.

[01:50:31.600 --> 01:50:33.400]
I mean, this has been going on since I'm sure long before we

[01:50:33.400 --> 01:50:33.880]
came along.

[01:50:34.820 --> 01:50:35.080]
Yeah.

[01:50:35.540 --> 01:50:36.540]
Think of the facts as well.

[01:50:36.540 --> 01:50:37.280]
I've heard the stories.

[01:50:37.560 --> 01:50:38.560]
People in tears.

[01:50:38.900 --> 01:50:41.360]
What do I have to do to get them to pay me?

[01:50:41.360 --> 01:50:42.380]
I've said this in voice.

[01:50:42.540 --> 01:50:42.980]
A thousand.

[01:50:44.620 --> 01:50:45.940]
People were made to kill themselves

[01:50:45.940 --> 01:50:47.540]
because the beastlies don't want to pay.

[01:50:47.840 --> 01:50:49.880]
They want you to play, but they don't want to pay.

[01:50:50.040 --> 01:50:50.680]
That's the way it works.

[01:50:50.880 --> 01:50:51.360]
Well, guess what?

[01:50:51.600 --> 01:50:54.180]
Tomorrow we're playing at no fart sounds all day

[01:50:54.180 --> 01:50:55.200]
if they don't take care of him.

[01:50:56.540 --> 01:50:56.700]
Yeah.

[01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.680]
And I want you to be in charge before I finish this very important

[01:50:59.680 --> 01:51:01.880]
article, Ripney and Jerry, follow the AST source.

[01:51:02.600 --> 01:51:05.200]
I just want you to be in charge of this and follow through.

[01:51:05.480 --> 01:51:05.640]
All right.

[01:51:06.520 --> 01:51:08.880]
So by the end of the day or by certainly tomorrow morning,

[01:51:08.880 --> 01:51:10.160]
when we can fabricate again, I'll

[01:51:10.160 --> 01:51:11.560]
have a definitive answer.

[01:51:12.020 --> 01:51:14.820]
We can plan our day because it's one thing about this thing

[01:51:14.820 --> 01:51:15.520]
as you well know.

[01:51:16.360 --> 01:51:20.120]
As you well know, this DCS, you can load up.

[01:51:20.200 --> 01:51:20.600]
Oh, yeah.

[01:51:20.860 --> 01:51:23.140]
You didn't, no matter what it is.

[01:51:23.180 --> 01:51:24.560]
It's just the hours of the day.

[01:51:24.840 --> 01:51:26.020]
But man, there you go.

[01:51:26.140 --> 01:51:26.400]
See that?

[01:51:26.500 --> 01:51:28.060]
By the way, wait a minute.

[01:51:28.460 --> 01:51:28.640]
Don't.

[01:51:28.740 --> 01:51:29.340]
All right.

[01:51:31.420 --> 01:51:32.380]
Let me know when.

[01:51:38.060 --> 01:51:38.420]
OK.

[01:51:38.420 --> 01:51:40.820]
The only person that we need to hear back from is Boca,

[01:51:40.940 --> 01:51:42.820]
because they can say anything to me inside the building.

[01:51:42.820 --> 01:51:44.120]
And I think I'm going to change anything.

[01:51:44.280 --> 01:51:46.420]
Well, how is he going to know when he gets a response

[01:51:46.420 --> 01:51:48.100]
from his email saying that the check's on the way

[01:51:48.100 --> 01:51:48.820]
or something like that?

[01:51:48.960 --> 01:51:49.980]
I mean, check is in the mail.

[01:51:50.360 --> 01:51:50.580]
Or something.

[01:51:50.700 --> 01:51:52.420]
The beastly tool you, the check was in the mail.

[01:51:52.500 --> 01:51:53.220]
What would I do?

[01:51:53.640 --> 01:51:54.660]
I would ask my ass off.

[01:51:54.760 --> 01:51:55.420]
Whoopie laughs sounds good.

[01:51:56.340 --> 01:51:58.240]
13, I have an effective votes in it, poor by the way.

[01:51:58.280 --> 01:51:59.720]
We got 14 that are made in the shade.

[01:51:59.900 --> 01:52:02.100]
And Chris is saying, oh gee, you were right, old man.

[01:52:02.260 --> 01:52:02.760]
You were right.

[01:52:03.500 --> 01:52:03.820]
Yeah.

[01:52:04.240 --> 01:52:05.640]
And I'm thinking holy Moses.

[01:52:06.600 --> 01:52:10.000]
While abortion clinics sprung up across the US during the early 1970s,

[01:52:10.340 --> 01:52:11.060]
evangelicals did little.

[01:52:11.540 --> 01:52:13.500]
No pastor's evoked the dreads caught decision to wonder

[01:52:13.500 --> 01:52:15.200]
mind the legal justification for abortion.

[01:52:15.640 --> 01:52:16.800]
There were no clinic blockades.

[01:52:17.120 --> 01:52:18.940]
No pastor to Christ to liberate the preborn.

[01:52:19.440 --> 01:52:22.020]
For a fall while in his allies, the true impetus for political action

[01:52:22.020 --> 01:52:24.900]
came when he subpoenaed court world in green versus calmly

[01:52:24.900 --> 01:52:28.720]
to revoke the tax of them status, a racially discriminatory private schools

[01:52:28.720 --> 01:52:29.560]
in 1971.

[01:52:30.400 --> 01:52:33.880]
The resentment was compounded in 75 when the internal revenue service

[01:52:33.880 --> 01:52:36.540]
was intended to revoke the tax of them status at Bob Jones University,

[01:52:36.940 --> 01:52:39.120]
which for bad, for bait, interracial dating.

[01:52:39.840 --> 01:52:41.600]
Life's were denied entry until that year.

[01:52:42.060 --> 01:52:45.780]
Follow as furious complaining in some states it's easy to open a massage parlor

[01:52:45.780 --> 01:52:47.180]
than to open a Christian school.

[01:52:48.320 --> 01:52:51.020]
Seeking to capitalize on mounting evangelical discontent,

[01:52:51.320 --> 01:52:54.260]
a white winged Washington operative and anti-betican two-caflic-name Paul

[01:52:54.260 --> 01:52:56.640]
Wyrick took a series of trips down south to meet with

[01:52:56.640 --> 01:52:58.120]
Wyrick and other evangelical leaders.

[01:52:58.720 --> 01:53:01.900]
Wyrick hoped to produce a well-funded evangelical lobbying outfit that could

[01:53:01.900 --> 01:53:05.060]
lend grassroots muscle to the top heavy Republican Party and effectively

[01:53:05.060 --> 01:53:09.180]
mobilize the vanquished forces of massive resistance into a new political block.

[01:53:09.840 --> 01:53:12.920]
In discussions with all, while Wyrick cited various social ills that

[01:53:12.920 --> 01:53:16.740]
necessitated evangelical involvement in politics, particularly abortion,

[01:53:17.280 --> 01:53:20.980]
school prayer, and the rise of feminism, his inflowations initially fell on

[01:53:20.980 --> 01:53:21.380]
deaf ears.

[01:53:22.100 --> 01:53:24.520]
I was trying to get these people interested in those issues and I utterly

[01:53:24.520 --> 01:53:27.720]
failed Wyrick recalled an interview in the early 90s where changed their mind

[01:53:27.720 --> 01:53:31.020]
with Jimmy Carter's intervention against the Christian schools, tried to deny

[01:53:31.020 --> 01:53:34.580]
them taxing them status on the basis of so-called de facto segregation.

[01:53:36.100 --> 01:53:39.520]
In 1979, at Wyrick's behest, Fawlwell founded a group that he called Moral

[01:53:39.520 --> 01:53:43.100]
Majority, along with a vanguard of evangelical icons, including the

[01:53:43.100 --> 01:53:47.940]
Unx's D. James Kennedy, Pad Robertson, and Tim LaHae, Fawlwell's organization

[01:53:47.940 --> 01:53:51.160]
Hoistid de Banner of Pro Family Movement, declaring war on abortion and

[01:53:51.160 --> 01:53:51.980]
homosexuality.

[01:53:52.640 --> 01:53:55.180]
But we're not for the federal government's attempts to enable little black

[01:53:55.180 --> 01:53:58.040]
boys and black girls to go to school with little white boys and white girls.

[01:53:58.040 --> 01:54:00.740]
The Christian rights culture were reluctantly never come into being.

[01:54:01.200 --> 01:54:04.280]
The religious new right didn't start because of concern about abortion,

[01:54:04.620 --> 01:54:08.380]
former Fawlwell ally Ed Dopson told the author Randall Bomber in 1990,

[01:54:08.820 --> 01:54:11.440]
I said to the non-smoke-filled backroom of the Moral Majority he said,

[01:54:11.780 --> 01:54:14.680]
and frankly don't remember abortion ever even being mentioned, as the reason why

[01:54:14.680 --> 01:54:15.440]
we ought to do something.

[01:54:16.400 --> 01:54:19.500]
As the Christian right gradually transmitted its racial resemblance to

[01:54:19.500 --> 01:54:23.320]
sexual politics, Liberty University began enrolling non-white students, and

[01:54:23.320 --> 01:54:24.780]
Thomas Road Baptist Church integrated.

[01:54:25.580 --> 01:54:30.260]
In the irony of ironies, in 2006, at Justice Sunday 3, a rally for the confirmation

[01:54:30.260 --> 01:54:34.180]
of Supreme Court nominee Sam Alito, a man who belonged to a white, only eating-closed

[01:54:34.180 --> 01:54:37.120]
Princeton University, Fawlwell hotingly rose to sing,

[01:54:37.420 --> 01:54:38.220]
We Shall Overcome.

[01:54:38.940 --> 01:54:43.420]
Behind him stood Martin Luther King Jr.'s niece, Alvita King, an evangelical anti-abortion

[01:54:43.420 --> 01:54:44.000]
activist.

[01:54:44.960 --> 01:54:47.760]
On the day of Fawlwell's death, Republican presidential firmmen

[01:54:47.760 --> 01:54:49.620]
has fell over each other to memorialize him.

[01:54:50.260 --> 01:54:53.920]
Arizona Senator John McCain, who in 2000 in the presidential campaign to

[01:54:53.920 --> 01:54:58.480]
call Fawlwell an agent of intolerance, then spoke at the 2006 graduation ceremony, Liberty

[01:54:58.480 --> 01:55:03.060]
University, praising Fawlwell as a man of distinguished accomplishment who devoted his life to serving

[01:55:03.060 --> 01:55:03.940]
his faith in country.

[01:55:04.680 --> 01:55:08.120]
Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor whose Mormon faith has listed as a

[01:55:08.120 --> 01:55:12.200]
cult by Fawlwell, Southern Baptist Convention, hailed him as an American who built and led

[01:55:12.200 --> 01:55:14.760]
a movement based on strong principles and strong faith.

[01:55:15.180 --> 01:55:18.720]
The legacy of his important work will continue through his many ministries where he put his

[01:55:18.720 --> 01:55:20.060]
faith into action, said Mitt.

[01:55:21.080 --> 01:55:25.360]
Rudy Giuliani, the thrice-married pro-choice former New York City Mayor, gay rights advocate,

[01:55:25.560 --> 01:55:29.540]
and, urs-wild cross-dresser, was also profused in his praise at Fawlwell.

[01:55:29.880 --> 01:55:33.360]
He was a man who said a direction, Giuliani, said he was someone who wasn't afraid to speak

[01:55:33.360 --> 01:55:35.420]
his mind, we all have great respect for him.

[01:55:36.100 --> 01:55:38.920]
I guess you could say that about Adolf Hitler too, he wasn't afraid to speak his mind.

[01:55:39.120 --> 01:55:39.420]
That's right.

[01:55:39.900 --> 01:55:43.460]
The Gershinc Unilogy is a Fawlwell by leading GOP presidential hopefuls, demonstrated

[01:55:43.460 --> 01:55:46.500]
the preachers earthly limitations and is enduring influence.

[01:55:46.500 --> 01:55:50.320]
Under Fawlwell's guidance, the Christian rights have summed much of the Republican apparatus

[01:55:50.320 --> 01:55:53.000]
and now holds the key to the presidential nominating process.

[01:55:53.660 --> 01:55:57.660]
McCain, Romney, and Giuliani may never see I die with Fawlwell even in heaven, but in

[01:55:57.660 --> 01:55:59.180]
the end they paid fealty of his grave.

[01:55:59.500 --> 01:56:00.800]
They're all Jerry's kids now.

[01:56:02.780 --> 01:56:03.700]
Ripperman-ass baby.

[01:56:03.900 --> 01:56:08.860]
Rippes-ass racist, hateful, sexist, lunatic.

[01:56:10.200 --> 01:56:13.820]
See, I said it before after 9-11 and it's the same thing and the media has wanted to

[01:56:13.900 --> 01:56:14.100]
do this.

[01:56:14.220 --> 01:56:18.480]
It's religious extremism, not sure terrorism, it's terrorism by religious extremism by

[01:56:18.480 --> 01:56:22.660]
crazy people and religious extremists whether it's by Muslims or born again Christians or

[01:56:22.660 --> 01:56:24.980]
Orthodox Jews or whatever, farbist and lunaticism.

[01:56:25.140 --> 01:56:28.480]
It's just as dangerous and once you're dead you're just as dead no matter which religion

[01:56:28.480 --> 01:56:28.920]
kill you.

[01:56:29.220 --> 01:56:33.240]
Nobody can prove their points so there's only one way to hash it out and that's that

[01:56:33.240 --> 01:56:33.460]
way.

[01:56:35.020 --> 01:56:37.780]
Well, isn't that what the most religions that I can think are?

[01:56:37.860 --> 01:56:41.540]
Not all of them, but most religions specialize in this.

[01:56:41.540 --> 01:56:42.300]
Kill some people.

[01:56:42.440 --> 01:56:42.800]
That's it.

[01:56:43.400 --> 01:56:45.040]
Just like they're doing in Iraq right now.

[01:56:45.180 --> 01:56:48.760]
What's the Shi'a and the Sunnis and the Kurds in the way and all this other crap?

[01:56:48.880 --> 01:56:49.960]
Yeah, everybody's in the way.

[01:56:50.780 --> 01:56:52.740]
Speaking of religious notes, there's John Ascroff.

[01:56:52.840 --> 01:56:53.520]
What's he doing on there?

[01:56:53.760 --> 01:56:55.300]
So call me, it sounds all right.

[01:56:55.300 --> 01:56:55.780]
Oh, brother.

[01:56:56.300 --> 01:56:58.280]
Okay, here's the appool thing right now, okay?

[01:56:59.620 --> 01:57:00.340]
1354 vote.

[01:57:01.040 --> 01:57:05.700]
Oh, we got 14 without, you know something without even working up sweat, without even

[01:57:05.700 --> 01:57:06.460]
breathing hard.

[01:57:08.220 --> 01:57:11.000]
On the Nenial Crofts, what will be your response?

[01:57:12.020 --> 01:57:14.280]
He died doing what he wanted to do, 403.

[01:57:14.460 --> 01:57:16.440]
He has something else leading, but I don't even know what the hell it means.

[01:57:16.800 --> 01:57:16.900]
You?

[01:57:17.780 --> 01:57:18.920]
No, what does that mean?

[01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:20.300]
I don't know.

[01:57:20.420 --> 01:57:21.580]
He's one of those things doing the same.

[01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:25.460]
Like I said, if it said that he died doing who he wanted to do, I say, all right, that

[01:57:25.460 --> 01:57:26.520]
would be worth dying for, I guess.

[01:57:27.780 --> 01:57:31.080]
Maybe we can get Brady's hand off of there long enough to leave room for, make room for

[01:57:31.080 --> 01:57:31.300]
Danny.

[01:57:34.740 --> 01:57:37.620]
I wonder if Danny Thomas could have gotten his big nose in there.

[01:57:37.740 --> 01:57:40.500]
Danny Thomas was, I think, like lesbian, easier, something or a Syrian, I don't know.

[01:57:40.820 --> 01:57:41.340]
One of those things.

[01:57:41.460 --> 01:57:42.380]
Asmr, Lord, she'd know.

[01:57:43.220 --> 01:57:46.180]
He was a lovely human being, blah, blah, blah, who's in the will to 87.

[01:57:47.500 --> 01:57:50.040]
He's in that big radio station in the sky, 191.

[01:57:50.340 --> 01:57:52.280]
He's Mackinon, Jesus, right now, 130.

[01:57:53.200 --> 01:57:55.320]
He died a free man, no wife, 109.

[01:57:55.380 --> 01:57:56.640]
He was a durable 105.

[01:57:57.780 --> 01:58:01.280]
I've been called many things in my life, but this adorable thing is, that's how you

[01:58:01.280 --> 01:58:01.440]
know.

[01:58:01.740 --> 01:58:03.980]
Every time I see that, I think, holy Moses.

[01:58:05.200 --> 01:58:09.700]
He was a rotten bastard, good riddance 80, 5.9%, see how the percentage keeps creeping

[01:58:09.700 --> 01:58:13.040]
up, but up, he was a rotten bastard, good riddance, hubbim and dread.

[01:58:13.980 --> 01:58:17.700]
I know he's up there looking down at us 30, and boy, I sure miss him, 19.

[01:58:18.560 --> 01:58:20.240]
Out of 1354 vote.

[01:58:20.800 --> 01:58:21.800]
I sure miss him.

[01:58:22.480 --> 01:58:25.360]
Even though I hated him, you know something, even the ones who hate me like poison, they're

[01:58:25.360 --> 01:58:26.120]
going to miss me the most.

[01:58:28.880 --> 01:58:29.560]
Hey, ass.

[01:58:31.220 --> 01:58:32.260]
Cause I know I'm gay.

[01:58:32.640 --> 01:58:33.720]
I know who you are.

[01:58:34.280 --> 01:58:36.460]
The African-American you hoist today sometimes.

[01:58:42.120 --> 01:58:43.700]
Oh, my gosh.

[01:58:44.680 --> 01:58:48.020]
Ain't no fun sounds like before

[01:58:48.700 --> 01:58:49.860]
Tui tu tu tu tu

[01:58:50.700 --> 01:58:54.200]
Ain't no fun sounds anymore

[01:58:54.200 --> 01:58:57.560]
The sun's stinky corporate home

[01:58:57.560 --> 01:58:59.980]
Name joys took them away

[01:59:02.940 --> 01:59:06.440]
Can't say f***ing out

[01:59:09.400 --> 01:59:12.740]
I'll bake a lot of some b***h now

[01:59:15.620 --> 01:59:18.560]
Just to bring the ratings down

[01:59:18.560 --> 01:59:20.860]
She don't want me around

[01:59:21.440 --> 01:59:24.460]
And that's why she took them away

[01:59:26.740 --> 01:59:29.580]
And she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows

[01:59:29.580 --> 01:59:32.340]
She blows, she blows, she blows, she blows

[01:59:32.340 --> 01:59:34.580]
She blows, she blows, she blows, she blows

[01:59:34.580 --> 01:59:36.880]
She blows, she blows, she blows, she blows

[01:59:36.880 --> 01:59:38.580]
She blows, you blow, you blow, you blow

[01:59:39.620 --> 01:59:42.500]
She blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows

[01:59:42.500 --> 01:59:45.520]
She blows, she blows, she blows

[01:59:45.520 --> 02:00:13.000]
She blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blow, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she

[02:00:30.860 --> 02:00:42.980]
blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows, she blows,

[02:00:42.980 --> 02:01:12.080]
We're talking about a lot of money folks, we're not talking big bucks here, we're not talking millions like they pay off for that Marlon's will. We're talking a few hundred bucks or maybe I don't know how much it is, what is it? 1,500, something like that. They could send a bell us there on the street corner with a tin cup and collected by 230 this afternoon. And he could drive a rental up there to bulk and hand it right over to Tick-A-Nex. So here you go. Yeah, there's an idea. A meat company is recalling 129,000 pounds of the product sold in Florida.

[02:01:12.080 --> 02:01:22.120]
And 14 other states because of possible E. coli contamination for the west Department of Agriculture in Kalamazoo. Well, I sure had a good two years in Kalamazoo man.

[02:01:22.480 --> 02:01:36.080]
Woo, 1968 and 69. I mean 1968 and 60 can't say that. The meat products are made by Davis Creek meats and seafood were made for Gordon food services. The USDA said on its website, yes, Tured Day.

[02:01:36.080 --> 02:01:48.660]
The meat products were made between March 1, April 30th and were shipped to distribution centers and retailers in Arkansas. Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Missouri, Iowa, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wisconsin.

[02:01:49.680 --> 02:01:56.060]
The items under we call include boxes of mechanically tenderized steaks and ground beef of different weights. I don't like the sound of that.

[02:01:57.480 --> 02:02:03.080]
Mechanically tenderized steaks and ground beef of different weights. I don't think I want my meat mechanically tenderized.

[02:02:03.120 --> 02:02:18.120]
All right. The boxes are labeled EST 1947 A. Maybe that's the year from the meat. Oh, no, I sure hope not. They're labeled EST 1947 A.

[02:02:19.580 --> 02:02:32.540]
Symptoms V. coli includes stomach cramps that made me severe in diarrhea. They may turn bloody within one to three days. E. coli can sometimes lead to complication food and kidney failure, which of course, usually leads to leads to.

[02:02:32.540 --> 02:03:02.500]
I'm dying. I'm here. I don't be no tainted meat because I think what do you think it might be? Okay. That's a Gordon. Well, who is it from? Davis Creek meets in seafood. Gordon food services. Well, I want to check your meat. I will. That's my suggestion to check it.

[02:03:03.100 --> 02:03:13.740]
When you go into it like a supermarket or something, they really just make me gag. One of them is fish, right? Oh, because I hate fish to begin with, but the smell of fish that's been served.

[02:03:13.860 --> 02:03:28.300]
Now, you know, even like outdoors, I can buy these to have this the outdoor market up there. Oh my God. And they used to have all this great stuff, cold cuts and produce and stuff. Price. Right. But then they also have the fish. Oh, nasty.

[02:03:29.740 --> 02:03:42.340]
And then the other thing is like a sport rotten meat and sometimes go to me. Oh, he's. Oh, he's. The back there. Whoa. Somebody's going to croak from that. No question about just hope it ain't me. Somebody's been a croak and choke.

[02:03:44.200 --> 02:03:55.380]
Speaking of that, the marriages are more than 170 gay couples from New York, who wed in Massachusetts before last July are valid because New York had not yet explicitly banned same sex marriages.

[02:03:55.380 --> 02:04:08.920]
A Massachusetts judge had ruled gay has ruled Israel couples are very familiar in Massachusetts if their marriages will be prohibited in their home states. The New York Court of Appeals ruled against same sex marriages July 6th of last year.

[02:04:09.600 --> 02:04:20.140]
Gay and lesbian advocates and defenders that answer clarification of the status of New York couples from married in Massachusetts before that ruling. Massachusetts became the first state in the country to allow gay marriage in May of 2004.

[02:04:20.940 --> 02:04:28.340]
Sufferks appear a court judge. Thomas Conley rule last week that those early marriages are legally valid. They don't need to come to Ontario.

[02:04:28.780 --> 02:04:42.900]
You sure don't need any more Americans up here. I'll tell you that. Just stay where the hell you are. Like all these idiots call up. Oh Canada sucks. Well, good. Stay right there. Stay there itself Florida. Man, where you'll be happy. Where you'll be safe with lots of people of your own kind.

[02:04:43.920 --> 02:04:49.540]
Just being able to say without any qualifications were married it feels great said Amy Zimmerman in New York City resident who married.

[02:04:50.020 --> 02:04:55.860]
Tanya Wexler in Somerville mass on May 19th 2004 the third day that same sex weddings were allowed in Massachusetts.

[02:04:57.360 --> 02:05:02.480]
A spokesman for New York attorney general Andrew Cromwell indicated his office considers the marriages valid.

[02:05:04.600 --> 02:05:11.800]
Since 2004 it's been the position of the attorney general's office. I want to position he's in probably prone that New York law

[02:05:11.800 --> 02:05:18.180]
presently requires the recognition of marriages valiantly performed other jurisdictions. John Milgram said the opinion he said it came from

[02:05:18.180 --> 02:05:27.520]
Kromos predecessor governor Elliott Spitzer. New York state is recognized same size marriages in some cases. Those performed in Canada for example are considered

[02:05:27.520 --> 02:05:34.540]
in determining public employees retirement benefits. Those performed in Canada. But in 2005 a state appeals for a role that a man could not

[02:05:34.540 --> 02:05:40.880]
do a hospital for malpractice in the death of his longtime partner despite their civil union in Vermont. I wonder maybe it was Ben and Jerry I think.

[02:05:42.300 --> 02:05:50.460]
Could have been. In fact, you know, Angie is some bit him that sends all the cute stuff for our my spacing. Yes. She said a cute one and had a couple of coffee cups on it.

[02:05:50.460 --> 02:05:57.260]
And one was a picture of Ben Laden and then the one had Jerry fall. Well said Ben and Jerry very nice. It was cute. Nice going to Angie. We love you.

[02:05:58.320 --> 02:06:07.700]
Michael Lord who heads New York City's conservative party predicted. Connolly's ruling will not hold up in New York if gay couples press for marriage rights there.

[02:06:08.180 --> 02:06:15.500]
It's swishful thinking is that swishful he said by some homosexual couples that the interpretation of a particular judge will change their status long said. That's his name long.

[02:06:15.500 --> 02:06:29.540]
The law in the state in New York is very clear marriages between a man and a woman. Let them suffer. Although the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court said in March 2006 that gay couples from states with no express prohibition of same-sex marriage could marry a

[02:06:29.540 --> 02:06:38.380]
Massachusetts. It was unclear at the time of the gay marriage was specifically banned in New York and wrote Ireland. Now there's a place that's kind of like neither fish nor foul. You know, wrote Ireland.

[02:06:39.300 --> 02:06:46.680]
I keep telling you I've told you a thousand times I was to near Gantzhead Park a hundred years ago. Race track. That's my that's my Rhode Island experience.

[02:06:47.800 --> 02:06:56.080]
What a lie. It's just I don't know. I mean you really think when you think of the west you think of Rhode Island is that one of the states that whatever even crossed your mind.

[02:06:56.300 --> 02:07:08.260]
There are a couple of states I Delaware and Rhode Island just I don't know if they're there. Connolly ruled in September that gay couples from Rhode Island have the right to marry a Massachusetts because laws in their state do not expressly prove it same-sex marriage.

[02:07:08.260 --> 02:07:19.620]
Whether what Island honors these marriages is an unsettled issue is legislatures rejected same-sex marriage but it's a trained general issue day non-biting opinion this year advising a state to recognize those who were that were conducted in Massachusetts.

[02:07:21.140 --> 02:07:30.160]
Especially if the BG's were attending the ceremonies. Remember Massachusetts. The press is very depressing. You want to plan? It's very morbid.

[02:07:31.300 --> 02:07:40.340]
First said you got it while you you search for it. I got more in the story here. Susan Summer senior council for legal a New York based gay rights organization said New York

[02:07:40.340 --> 02:07:47.620]
common laws held it as long as the marriage is valid where it's performed it'll be respected in New York. Not everybody along the way to agree there's been some litigation

[02:07:47.620 --> 02:07:55.620]
amounted but the clear distinction is one of growing respect and recognition she said. Spitzer a Democrat has proposed that gay marriage be legalized but it's so far

[02:07:55.620 --> 02:08:03.340]
fair that it's either the Republican-led states and or the Democratic control New York state assembly to do so because there are a bunch of wins. Well the Republicans we know what they are.

[02:08:04.500 --> 02:08:12.680]
There's John Edwards by the way. Target of scrutiny. That's because Edward said he worked at Fortress investment in 2006 to learn about financial markets.

[02:08:12.760 --> 02:08:19.620]
Now that's had some big scandal and get him out of the picture already okay he's a loser. He's got loser written all over that redneck forehead is you know John Edwards loser.

[02:08:19.670 --> 02:08:28.930]
Loser and whatever like a draw though. Yeah I got not throw all though as vice-guide breast cancer so we have a support him you know what.

[02:08:29.530 --> 02:08:34.710]
I mean not that I want to make light of that it's already tragic and sad and all these things just support her breasts could what.

[02:08:35.310 --> 02:08:43.010]
Well I'm sure she's got some help with that already. In fact there she is right now my TV screen she had a sweater on and as soon as you said something about

[02:08:43.010 --> 02:08:51.510]
the breast you like to cover up. She closed up no she closed up the sweat. She knows they she knows you're looking. I am she ain't much I'll tell you that of course he ain't much either but never less.

[02:08:52.790 --> 02:09:00.310]
1370 votes on the pool on the Daniel Crocs what will be your response he died doing what he wanted to do for a six I have no idea what that means and I'm sure you do they.

[02:09:00.790 --> 02:09:08.750]
He was a lovely human being blah blah blah who's in the will to 92. He's in that big radio station in the sky one 94.

[02:09:08.750 --> 02:09:15.870]
He's mechanized Jesus right now 130. He died a free man no wife 110. He was adorable when I said he's so adorable.

[02:09:16.890 --> 02:09:22.250]
If I'm adorable man I'd hate to think what anything else might be and I'm saying.

[02:09:22.370 --> 02:09:33.650]
He was a rotten bastard good riddance 80 5.8% that went down to tick now thank a 5.18% said I'm a rotten bastard good riddance I should only croak a wicked horrible death.

[02:09:34.330 --> 02:09:45.510]
I know he's up there looking down at us 30 and by boy I sure miss him 26. I'm sure Greg by Chris added that you know it ends it has a certain element of civility to an otherwise very hostile.

[02:09:45.990 --> 02:09:52.070]
He told you know kind of a polar and of course that's a kind of folder expect right in South Florida.

[02:09:52.210 --> 02:09:54.710]

[02:11:00.630 --> 02:11:07.570]
Singing is the lowest form of communicating. It's embarrassing.

[02:11:13.110 --> 02:11:15.950]
We have found the worst thing in the world.

[02:11:20.070 --> 02:11:23.270]
I don't need to be unkind but you have one of the worst in the world.

[02:11:23.270 --> 02:11:28.350]
It's the now the second to the national and all the viewers are ready to start crying.

It's terrible.

[02:11:29.670 --> 02:11:30.530]
It's just terrible.

[02:11:30.830 --> 02:11:31.390]
I got you.

[02:11:31.890 --> 02:11:33.570]
American I'll just hail.

[02:11:33.950 --> 02:11:38.410]
I think I'll sing something a little more upbeat.

[02:11:38.850 --> 02:11:41.930]
We'll be back our years and try to withstand.

[02:11:42.710 --> 02:11:44.250]
American I don't.

[02:11:44.330 --> 02:11:47.650]
I'm gonna juice that damn said gun country whatever.

[02:11:47.650 --> 02:11:48.970]
Make it me.

[02:11:49.510 --> 02:11:50.710]
The down country.

[02:11:51.190 --> 02:11:51.730]
The back.

[02:11:51.990 --> 02:11:53.270]
It stands out the booth.

[02:11:53.570 --> 02:11:54.530]
The down country.

[02:11:55.010 --> 02:11:57.030]
Well, it's under what's moved.

[02:11:57.270 --> 02:11:58.370]
It's the final country.

[02:11:58.990 --> 02:11:59.990]
It's such hard.

[02:12:00.090 --> 02:12:00.910]
The shark is gone.

[02:12:01.290 --> 02:12:02.230]
What kind of music?

[02:12:03.690 --> 02:12:05.110]
Oh, we got hope cats.

[02:12:05.270 --> 02:12:06.430]
We got country and western.

[02:12:06.570 --> 02:12:07.610]
Yeah, and we'd be dumb man.

[02:12:07.750 --> 02:12:08.550]
We'd be really dumb.

[02:12:09.030 --> 02:12:10.050]
Cook the end western.

[02:12:10.330 --> 02:12:11.250]
He'll come back now.

[02:12:11.310 --> 02:12:12.810]
You're really dumb in the deep style.

[02:12:13.030 --> 02:12:15.970]
That is just one of them thing.

[02:12:16.710 --> 02:12:17.450]
One of them thing.

[02:12:17.450 --> 02:12:17.450]

[02:12:17.450 --> 02:12:17.630]
I think it's the best thing.

[02:12:17.630 --> 02:12:17.630]

[02:12:17.630 --> 02:12:17.630]

[02:12:17.630 --> 02:12:17.630]

[02:12:17.630 --> 02:12:17.630]

[02:12:17.630 --> 02:12:17.630]

[02:12:27.930 --> 02:12:29.050]
I think it's the best thing.

[02:12:29.390 --> 02:12:29.490]
I think it's the best thing.

[02:12:29.510 --> 02:12:29.530]
I think it's the best thing.

[02:12:29.530 --> 02:12:29.530]

[02:12:29.530 --> 02:12:29.530]

[02:12:29.530 --> 02:12:29.530]

[02:12:29.530 --> 02:12:29.650]
I think it's the best thing.

[02:12:29.650 --> 02:12:29.650]

[02:12:29.650 --> 02:12:29.650]

[02:12:29.650 --> 02:12:29.850]
I think it's the best thing.

[02:12:29.850 --> 02:12:29.850]

[02:12:29.850 --> 02:12:29.850]

[02:12:29.850 --> 02:12:29.850]

[02:12:29.850 --> 02:12:30.690]
I think it's the best thing.

[02:12:30.690 --> 02:12:32.110]
I think it's the best thing.

[02:12:32.110 --> 02:12:32.990]
I think it's the best thing.

[02:12:33.570 --> 02:12:34.570]
I think it's the best thing.

[02:12:34.570 --> 02:12:37.870]
I think it's the best thing.

[02:12:37.930 --> 02:12:38.710]
I think it's the best thing.

[02:12:38.710 --> 02:12:41.010]
I think it's the best thing.

[02:12:41.790 --> 02:12:44.110]
I think it's the best thing.

[02:12:44.110 --> 02:12:47.610]
I think it's the best thing.

[02:12:49.330 --> 02:12:52.430]
Looks like in battle world bank president Paul Wolfowitz is the latest

[02:12:52.430 --> 02:12:56.190]
casualty of the George W. Bush Brownie or doing a heck of a job syndrome.

[02:12:57.310 --> 02:13:00.630]
After weeks of unqualified support, White House officials are now backing away

[02:13:00.630 --> 02:13:03.650]
from Wolfie faster than a champion horse at the Kentucky Derby.

[02:13:04.530 --> 02:13:06.270]
Clearly, Wolfowitz's days are numbered.

[02:13:07.190 --> 02:13:10.070]
The Bush administration, let's see, writes Peter Goodman of the Washington Post,

[02:13:10.470 --> 02:13:13.790]
the Bush administration's softened its support for the world bank president Paul Wolfowitz yesterday,

[02:13:13.790 --> 02:13:18.270]
signaling a willingness to replace him if the bank's executive board resolves an ethics

[02:13:18.270 --> 02:13:19.850]
controversy without firing him.

[02:13:20.350 --> 02:13:23.870]
All options around the table said White House spokesman Tony Snow addressing me

[02:13:23.870 --> 02:13:24.890]
protested a morning briefing.

[02:13:25.490 --> 02:13:28.570]
Members of the board, Mr. Wolfowitz, need to sit down and figure out what in fact

[02:13:28.570 --> 02:13:30.850]
is going to be best for this bank, he said.

[02:13:31.910 --> 02:13:35.230]
The shift of tone at the White House, which nominated Wolfowitz for the post two years ago,

[02:13:35.530 --> 02:13:38.230]
is a blow to his struggle to save his job.

[02:13:38.330 --> 02:13:39.570]
It blows kind of like joy.

[02:13:39.710 --> 02:13:40.050]
It blows.

[02:13:40.610 --> 02:13:43.770]
It came a day after a bank investigating committee found that Wolfowitz broke out

[02:13:43.770 --> 02:13:47.410]
the ethics rules and damaging integrity of the institution by engineering a large raise

[02:13:47.410 --> 02:13:51.510]
for his girlfriend, Shaharisa, while keeping the bank's top legal advisor out of the loop.

[02:13:53.290 --> 02:13:56.410]
Senior Bush administration officials emphasized that the White House has an

[02:13:56.410 --> 02:13:58.510]
abandonable voice and doesn't believe he should be fired.

[02:13:59.030 --> 02:14:02.210]
But the White House has concluded through conversations with counter-parts and foreign

[02:14:02.210 --> 02:14:05.590]
capitals and from the committee report that Wolfowitz can no longer effectively

[02:14:05.590 --> 02:14:08.850]
had the institution officials said, speaking unconditionally not being named because

[02:14:08.850 --> 02:14:11.570]
they lacked authorization to discuss the matter publicly and public.

[02:14:12.290 --> 02:14:15.470]
We've considered that this is an issue for people at the bank and our colleagues at

[02:14:15.470 --> 02:14:18.430]
the other government said the senior White House official will engage in discussion about

[02:14:18.430 --> 02:14:19.930]
the future leadership of the bank.

[02:14:20.150 --> 02:14:20.910]
What a big putty we've put about.

[02:14:21.190 --> 02:14:23.470]
And that the spit girl man is looking really nasty.

[02:14:23.930 --> 02:14:25.730]
Even Bill Haley would be upset about that.

[02:14:26.850 --> 02:14:29.950]
When that disgusting money spit on that Coleman like, oh, yeah.

[02:14:30.670 --> 02:14:32.830]
Shmeered that curly cue back.

[02:14:34.250 --> 02:14:37.730]
What a disgusting revolting sub-human slime ball.

[02:14:38.370 --> 02:14:41.110]
Project for the New American Century, my ass.

[02:14:42.770 --> 02:14:44.290]
I wonder how Richard Pearl is doing.

[02:14:44.570 --> 02:14:46.610]
How many people see responsible for killing the day?

[02:14:47.150 --> 02:14:47.690]
How many million?

[02:14:47.990 --> 02:14:48.950]
About 30, man.

[02:14:49.570 --> 02:14:51.230]
1385 and a poor slowing down a little bit.

[02:14:51.330 --> 02:14:52.670]
Better give a little goose there.

[02:14:52.790 --> 02:14:53.850]
Chris, they might not get to 1400.

[02:14:54.190 --> 02:14:55.330]
I mean, that would be kind of embarrassing.

[02:14:55.770 --> 02:14:56.170]
Not at all.

[02:14:56.810 --> 02:14:57.170]
1389.

[02:14:57.370 --> 02:14:58.830]
We need 11 votes in 56 minutes.

[02:14:58.970 --> 02:15:01.990]
If we can't do that, the transmitter must be in the negative position.

[02:15:02.570 --> 02:15:05.230]
Kind of like our numbers during certain day parts in the point.

[02:15:05.230 --> 02:15:07.510]
Oh, negative position like 11 o'clock at night.

[02:15:07.850 --> 02:15:09.030]
We have no audience.

[02:15:09.170 --> 02:15:09.490]
Nobody.

[02:15:09.910 --> 02:15:11.210]
Not a janitor.

[02:15:11.450 --> 02:15:12.490]
Not a night watchman.

[02:15:12.890 --> 02:15:16.330]
Not some deadbeat on the street that's here in the transistor.

[02:15:16.930 --> 02:15:18.570]
No, nobody at 11 o'clock at night.

[02:15:19.270 --> 02:15:19.710]
Nobody.

[02:15:21.350 --> 02:15:23.510]
I ain't got nobody who's saying that.

[02:15:24.430 --> 02:15:25.130]
Everybody's saying that.

[02:15:25.390 --> 02:15:25.450]
Sure.

[02:15:26.870 --> 02:15:28.190]
I ain't got nobody.

[02:15:28.330 --> 02:15:29.230]
You got it.

[02:15:31.210 --> 02:15:32.610]
You wouldn't have an old person.

[02:15:33.130 --> 02:15:34.230]
You wouldn't have an old person.

[02:15:34.230 --> 02:15:34.670]
No, another.

[02:15:35.370 --> 02:15:36.510]
Well, look it up.

[02:15:36.950 --> 02:15:39.530]
Not that anybody wants to hear it, but it just kills him good time.

[02:15:40.190 --> 02:15:42.430]
Oh, either that or we can play that no fart sounds again.

[02:15:43.250 --> 02:15:47.650]
Don't forget, if Locke Brian doesn't get some satisfactory answer by tomorrow morning at 10 o'clock,

[02:15:47.950 --> 02:15:51.150]
I'm playing no fart sounds, no no no fart sounds for four hours.

[02:15:52.890 --> 02:15:58.230]
I mean, what else am I going to do other than just, you know, I just slip my wrist or something and open up the club?

[02:15:58.230 --> 02:15:58.650]
Look at that, dude.

[02:15:58.710 --> 02:15:59.150]
What do you mean?

[02:15:59.630 --> 02:16:00.630]
Yeah, I can do that too.

[02:16:01.810 --> 02:16:10.050]
I can come on here and just make it up because they would know just like, I got a big bucket sitting under my elbow here and the blood is flowing down.

[02:16:10.050 --> 02:16:10.970]
What did you say?

[02:16:11.370 --> 02:16:12.070]
You heard what I said.

[02:16:12.310 --> 02:16:12.670]
Bucket.

[02:16:13.570 --> 02:16:14.370]
I read it well.

[02:16:15.490 --> 02:16:26.290]
House Democrats tried to rev up Florida's plotting search for property tax relief inequity yesterday by unveiling a detailed plan of exemptions like the local median housing values or for commercial taxpayers index to inflation.

[02:16:27.130 --> 02:16:39.670]
House Democratic leader Dan Gilbert of Miami Beach, who is very Jewish, said it is similar in some respects to the latest proposal from the Chamber's Republican majority, which calls for percentage-based exemptions because both the target relief to those who need it the most.

[02:16:40.490 --> 02:16:43.230]
We don't think their plan is a contemptuous plan, Gilbert said.

[02:16:43.550 --> 02:16:44.470]
It's a workable approach.

[02:16:44.750 --> 02:16:47.390]
It just doesn't work necessarily as well from county to county.

[02:16:47.390 --> 02:16:54.430]
The Democrats' proposal includes specific dollar amounts for sentences in charge showing expected savings needs of Florida 67 counties.

[02:16:54.790 --> 02:16:57.990]
They estimated would cut taxes 4 billion to 5 billion dollars a year statewide.

[02:16:58.850 --> 02:17:03.890]
Details of the Republican approach, House Speaker Marco Rubio, West Miami disclosed last week, had yet to be worked out.

[02:17:04.190 --> 02:17:06.290]
They're still working on it and the details too.

[02:17:07.570 --> 02:17:17.370]
That followed an earlier House GOP proposal to slash a limited property taxes on primary homes known as home states in exchange for increasing the 6% statewide sales tax to at least 7% as much as 8000.

[02:17:17.850 --> 02:17:19.650]
Well, let's just make it 100%.

[02:17:19.650 --> 02:17:23.370]
You find an item that costs you $10.00, oh now it costs you $20.00.

[02:17:24.530 --> 02:17:32.250]
The Senate, Governor Charlie Christ and most House Democrats imposed the tax swap and lawmakers were unable to resolve the differences before the regular session ended made for.

[02:17:32.590 --> 02:17:35.390]
They'll try again in a special session, June 12-22.

[02:17:36.950 --> 02:17:44.530]
Responded to the Democratic proposal, Rubio issued a statement saying, all ideas are welcome as long as they resolve and bills taxpayers can afford regardless of how much government wants.

[02:17:45.650 --> 02:17:54.850]
Rubio and other House Republicans have set a goal of cutting taxes for homestead by an average of 12-hundred bucks a year and other residents are used by 750 bucks and for businesses by 3,300 bucks.

[02:17:55.190 --> 02:17:59.510]
He overset such statewide averages are meaningless to individual taxpayers who want to know what they're going to say.

[02:17:59.990 --> 02:18:00.350]
Meaningless.

[02:18:02.670 --> 02:18:07.390]
Just toss in a bunch of numbers around like that poll for Christ's 1694 vote.

[02:18:08.450 --> 02:18:13.010]
What's going to happen when we get over 1,400 next couple of minutes? What are you going to say then, Chris? You own apology.

[02:18:13.630 --> 02:18:14.450]
I'll say congratulations.

[02:18:15.430 --> 02:18:18.030]
No, you own apology to everybody, me especially.

[02:18:18.850 --> 02:18:25.710]
Oh, the Senate, for selling me sure, I said 14 ever. You said, oh, 1350, don't get carried away. And you sounded just like a Bulkamper when you said it.

[02:18:25.710 --> 02:18:25.850]
Huh?

[02:18:26.770 --> 02:18:27.870]
You know what I'm talking about.

[02:18:27.970 --> 02:18:30.670]

[02:18:39.270 --> 02:18:43.930]
Hmm see they don't even know the right thing to do a Thursday is gay day not Tuesday

[02:29:36.170 --> 02:29:40.770]
color or racist as long as there would people who doesn't bother me and i feel basically the same

[02:29:40.770 --> 02:29:45.730]
way although well you know there's some some exceptions but nevertheless across the nation

[02:29:45.730 --> 02:29:49.490]
white americans increasingly are watching their communities being transformed by minorities

[02:29:49.490 --> 02:29:54.030]
new data released today by the census bureau shows that the nation's minority population

[02:29:54.030 --> 02:29:59.830]
has reached a milestone surpassing a hundred million and accounting for one in three u.s. residents

[02:30:00.430 --> 02:30:04.370]
the news mirror shifts already well underway in broward county where non-Hispanic whites made up

[02:30:04.370 --> 02:30:12.950]
49.9% of the population in 2005 half of broward now is non-Hispanic white is that incredible or what

[02:30:12.950 --> 02:30:17.870]
i would say i said it already but others in south foot are uncomfortable with the surge of minority

[02:30:17.870 --> 02:30:22.650]
population they see their neighborhoods rapidly changing and worried that they less frequently hear

[02:30:22.650 --> 02:30:28.270]
english and visits to their supermarkets banks and heirs alans well when you go to the bank

[02:30:28.270 --> 02:30:35.230]
and they look at you and go i but i want power what do you know that means i just don't want to

[02:30:35.230 --> 02:30:39.530]
lose my country said wonders mother don't delete 65 when leech moved to broward from pencil

[02:30:39.530 --> 02:30:43.930]
vignia 17 years ago everyone in the local shop spoke english she said today she off here is

[02:30:43.930 --> 02:30:49.990]
esponial and sometimes feels excluded where we heard this before it's getting to be all his

[02:30:49.990 --> 02:30:53.430]
panics she said i come to terraria we don't have much of that here yet

[02:30:54.230 --> 02:30:59.890]
just wait got everything else though speaking of engines man we got more people from india

[02:30:59.890 --> 02:31:03.070]
and then they got you know they got a billion people in india i thought only china had a billion

[02:31:03.070 --> 02:31:08.170]
people all good in j as well yes they do they're all packed in there and their trains keep crashing

[02:31:08.170 --> 02:31:13.630]
and their planes keep falling on the ground all you know stuff like that not good in south

[02:31:13.630 --> 02:31:17.130]
floor to some light said they largely associated minorities with recent immigrants from overseas

[02:31:17.130 --> 02:31:21.530]
rather than black surmerkin indians most were aware that florida were black and his panics

[02:31:21.530 --> 02:31:25.690]
comprised more than 6.3 million of the state's 18 million residents is one of the states leading

[02:31:25.690 --> 02:31:31.550]
the way minority growth according to census data florida's got 3.6 million Hispanic residents

[02:31:31.550 --> 02:31:36.810]
out from 2.7 million in 2000 that's an increase of almost a million in just seven years

[02:31:37.550 --> 02:31:41.790]
that's because they're they're they're coming in or is that because your people are reproducing

[02:31:41.790 --> 02:31:48.370]
like rabbits both oh well the proplex you know i know the states got 2.7 million black

[02:31:48.370 --> 02:31:52.670]
residents up from 2.3 million others were positive about browns brought up making racial

[02:31:52.670 --> 02:31:57.490]
mix if a sociologist Howard housing who is black and lives in modern day lakes gave the county

[02:31:57.490 --> 02:32:00.790]
high marks for diversity and said to me serve as a good example for other parts of the country

[02:32:00.790 --> 02:32:05.930]
just beginning to experience the salad bowl oh the salad bowl my ass what kind of dressing

[02:32:05.930 --> 02:32:10.350]
that on that well don't look to me to toss it i'm thinking about lunch now as a matter of say i

[02:32:10.350 --> 02:32:13.590]
wish you wouldn't have said that how are you going to say that salad bowl because i'm got food

[02:32:13.590 --> 02:32:18.170]
on my mind again i wasn't even thinking yeah we'll go have a nice salad i'm not having no

[02:32:18.170 --> 02:32:24.210]
salad or toss it yourself salads are for pansies okay man real men don't eat salads you know who

[02:32:24.210 --> 02:32:30.290]
we are kind of in a salad yeah now they like to toss it too culture and ethnic diversity i

[02:32:30.290 --> 02:32:34.770]
ready to find south florida and by some accounts has done so for 20 years what would be better

[02:32:34.770 --> 02:32:38.130]
is to get beyond pluralism and deliver it to go out of my way to interact with people who are

[02:32:38.130 --> 02:32:43.170]
different from me to enhance myself how's it said well that's what i do i go out of my way to

[02:32:43.170 --> 02:32:46.850]
interact with people who are different from me who who look good usually you know really good

[02:32:48.270 --> 02:32:53.110]
and not necessarily of the same you know who aren't Jewish for example and although they my

[02:32:53.110 --> 02:32:57.670]
prouder jury's they're all right that's okay who i make an exception for that i don't want to go

[02:32:57.670 --> 02:33:01.290]
out of that whole thing again because you get so emotional yeah every time that you get very

[02:33:01.290 --> 02:33:04.770]
dry do it's probably because of your ethnic background

[02:33:05.390 --> 02:33:11.530]
when it comes to sports we're the authority sports 20 or 5 16 you know she way yet

[02:33:12.380 --> 02:33:13.000]
i don't know

[02:33:41.540 --> 02:33:45.880]
It's a legal drug recording tool

[02:33:46.440 --> 02:33:50.960]
A little diocene

[02:33:50.960 --> 02:33:51.680]
Oh!

[02:33:52.500 --> 02:33:56.180]
The day the tree

[02:33:56.740 --> 02:33:59.960]
Coring as they're screaming

[02:34:01.240 --> 02:34:09.720]
Oh, can it best be that that's done to me?

[02:34:09.720 --> 02:34:11.260]
Got some good news

[02:34:13.520 --> 02:34:14.540]
Both of you get paid?

[02:34:15.700 --> 02:34:17.160]
No, not that good

[02:34:17.720 --> 02:34:21.040]
Oh, look at that tree

[02:34:21.040 --> 02:34:22.200]
Well, thanks to that photo

[02:34:22.200 --> 02:34:26.480]
Now the administration is brokering a deal so he can resign

[02:34:26.480 --> 02:34:27.400]
Rather than be fired

[02:34:27.400 --> 02:34:29.380]
You're fired and no, he resigned

[02:34:29.380 --> 02:34:31.260]
Like that

[02:34:31.260 --> 02:34:37.000]
In that whole business about America would drugs that thing by what the hell is that guy?

[02:34:37.960 --> 02:34:41.000]
So I read earlier that former congressman from Alaska, whatever the hell is that?

[02:34:41.040 --> 02:34:41.980]
I can never think of his name

[02:34:42.300 --> 02:34:43.880]
I would cite out of mind but that was great

[02:34:43.880 --> 02:34:45.580]
Legalized all drugs and put bush in jail

[02:34:45.580 --> 02:34:46.720]
So they're open to me

[02:34:48.240 --> 02:34:49.940]
1433, you know Chris, I hate to say this to you

[02:34:49.940 --> 02:34:51.200]
But if you'd been a little more positive

[02:34:52.360 --> 02:34:53.540]
You made 15 easy

[02:34:53.540 --> 02:34:56.980]
I told you 15, you know, all of 1350, 1350

[02:34:57.540 --> 02:34:58.300]
Yeah, that's what it was

[02:34:58.300 --> 02:35:01.960]
I want to know if clearance came in there yet and gave you a definitive answer about it

[02:35:01.960 --> 02:35:03.320]
I want to know why

[02:35:03.320 --> 02:35:06.260]
I want to know if Debbie from our county came in there and said listen to her

[02:35:06.260 --> 02:35:06.460]
No

[02:35:06.460 --> 02:35:09.140]
I took care of it, I called over there and I bitched out Carolyn Beasley

[02:35:09.140 --> 02:35:11.540]
And I told him if they don't cut the crap and pay Boca Brand

[02:35:11.540 --> 02:35:13.660]
I'm going to personally go over there and dump on her desk

[02:35:14.900 --> 02:35:16.600]
She didn't say that at all, well guess what?

[02:35:16.660 --> 02:35:16.760]
No

[02:35:17.920 --> 02:35:19.160]
That's my comment to that

[02:35:19.160 --> 02:35:20.820]
Well considering the last time we had the dolphins

[02:35:21.340 --> 02:35:26.860]
Mandate who used to complain that he would get his reimbursed for the road games about six months later

[02:35:27.280 --> 02:35:29.720]
I don't see Boca being very lucky right now

[02:35:29.720 --> 02:35:30.780]
Now let me just tell you about this

[02:35:30.780 --> 02:35:33.360]
See, you don't know this because you're a punk in your area, Johnny, completely

[02:35:33.360 --> 02:35:36.720]
Back in the day before Mandate had his own show when he was just a part-time run

[02:35:36.720 --> 02:35:40.480]
A station he would do filling stuff and work here and there which is for a long time

[02:35:41.280 --> 02:35:44.580]
Back in those days every time he was on here he'd be screaming and pitching

[02:35:44.580 --> 02:35:46.500]
And rightfully so by the way, he would deserve a little bit

[02:35:46.500 --> 02:35:48.600]
So right about the fact that he couldn't get paid by them

[02:35:48.600 --> 02:35:50.280]
Oh, I mean it happens a lot though

[02:35:50.280 --> 02:35:51.680]
I mean I hear it a lot working on the shows

[02:35:52.920 --> 02:35:54.700]
You mean even still now to this day?

[02:35:56.220 --> 02:35:56.580]
Yes

[02:35:57.040 --> 02:35:59.460]
Even now for this day they don't want to pay anybody well

[02:35:59.460 --> 02:35:59.900]
BAM

[02:35:59.900 --> 02:36:01.160]
That's my comment to them

[02:36:01.620 --> 02:36:05.000]
Okay, that goes for the beesleaves and joys

[02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:06.820]
All these co-conspirators, okay?

[02:36:07.060 --> 02:36:07.300]
BAM

[02:36:07.300 --> 02:36:08.760]
That's what I have to say to you

[02:36:09.640 --> 02:36:14.600]
People put in a good day's work, Boca Brian, my god, is a genius and unsung hero of this show

[02:36:14.600 --> 02:36:16.360]
Of the universe, not just of this show

[02:36:17.760 --> 02:36:21.260]
I might have to play weapons of mass destruction just as my way of saying this to them

[02:36:21.260 --> 02:36:21.480]
BAM

[02:36:21.480 --> 02:36:22.020]
Right

[02:36:22.880 --> 02:36:26.900]
I mean no, seriously he's done, I mean not just the one about no more fart sounds

[02:36:26.900 --> 02:36:28.540]
But legendary

[02:36:30.100 --> 02:36:30.800]
Remarkable even

[02:36:30.800 --> 02:36:32.580]
The Middle Eastern world

[02:36:32.580 --> 02:36:36.680]
Will be exploded to dumb at people killed

[02:36:36.680 --> 02:36:39.280]
With the gas that we sold him

[02:36:39.280 --> 02:36:40.980]
First time aggressor nation

[02:36:40.980 --> 02:36:43.180]
And the only one that's going

[02:36:43.180 --> 02:36:45.360]
Now more blood will be spilled

[02:36:45.360 --> 02:36:47.580]
To get that oil flowing

[02:36:47.580 --> 02:36:49.300]
Forget about Korea

[02:36:49.300 --> 02:36:53.820]
And the nooks there, toks in that the right wing

[02:36:53.820 --> 02:36:57.080]
Is drilling it over and over

[02:36:57.080 --> 02:36:59.060]
And to our heads

[02:36:59.060 --> 02:37:05.420]
That Iraq has some weapons of mass destruction

[02:37:05.420 --> 02:37:06.380]
BAM

[02:37:09.060 --> 02:37:09.560]
Right

[02:37:09.560 --> 02:37:10.240]
I mean

[02:37:10.240 --> 02:37:10.240]

[02:37:10.240 --> 02:37:10.240]

[02:37:10.240 --> 02:37:11.700]
I mean

[02:37:11.700 --> 02:37:11.700]

[02:37:15.840 --> 02:37:18.560]
3,000 people killed

[02:37:18.560 --> 02:37:22.300]
Are not forgotten, let's exploit them instead

[02:37:22.300 --> 02:37:24.660]
Hate their oil to be cotton

[02:37:24.660 --> 02:37:26.940]
Going after Saddam too

[02:37:26.940 --> 02:37:28.640]
Plankato Sama

[02:37:28.640 --> 02:37:31.080]
There's no longer mention of

[02:37:31.080 --> 02:37:32.880]
The name been lotten

[02:37:32.880 --> 02:37:35.260]
But no one seemed concerned all

[02:37:35.260 --> 02:37:36.300]
From being complacent

[02:37:37.320 --> 02:37:38.660]
Believe in every word

[02:37:38.660 --> 02:37:40.300]
Of this cartel administration

[02:37:40.940 --> 02:37:43.020]
That controls this white bear

[02:37:43.020 --> 02:37:44.780]
Through media manipulation

[02:37:44.780 --> 02:37:47.180]
And the right wing

[02:37:47.180 --> 02:37:50.380]
Is drilling it over and over

[02:37:50.380 --> 02:37:52.460]
And to our heads

[02:37:52.460 --> 02:37:58.720]
That Iraq has some weapons of mass destruction

[02:38:08.480 --> 02:38:13.580]
The loss of civil rights is the price that we're paying

[02:38:13.580 --> 02:38:17.600]
We're all suspects now, not the ash drop is seen

[02:38:17.600 --> 02:38:19.560]
I have nothing to hide

[02:38:19.560 --> 02:38:21.780]
Cable talkers all are saying

[02:38:21.780 --> 02:38:25.920]
Blind obedient cattle don't have any reservations

[02:38:25.920 --> 02:38:29.600]
Foul of provoked faddle and world annihilation

[02:38:30.160 --> 02:38:31.940]
Old regimes must fall

[02:38:31.940 --> 02:38:33.840]
In haliburton and snow

[02:38:33.840 --> 02:38:36.200]
With no objection at all

[02:38:36.200 --> 02:38:38.360]
Then the crap don't have the balls

[02:38:38.360 --> 02:38:40.220]
And the right wing

[02:38:40.220 --> 02:38:43.220]
Is drilling it over and over

[02:38:43.220 --> 02:38:46.500]
And to our brain wash pits

[02:38:46.500 --> 02:38:48.300]
I rack has some

[02:38:49.140 --> 02:38:51.640]
Weapons of mass destruction

[02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:56.580]
Only I rack has some

[02:38:57.280 --> 02:38:59.820]
Weapons of mass destruction

[02:39:01.380 --> 02:39:02.660]
How do you like that man

[02:39:02.660 --> 02:39:04.660]
The work of a genius and that's it

[02:39:04.660 --> 02:39:06.860]
How come he didn't resubmit that telecom any services

[02:39:06.860 --> 02:39:08.000]
So that they would pick it up now

[02:39:08.000 --> 02:39:09.380]
Because everybody's anti-war now

[02:39:09.380 --> 02:39:09.860]
He might have

[02:39:10.900 --> 02:39:12.180]
And they still won't plan

[02:39:12.180 --> 02:39:12.820]
I don't know

[02:39:15.060 --> 02:39:17.460]
That's another reason we ought to be heard all around the world

[02:39:17.460 --> 02:39:20.320]
Not just here on his horseball radio station where they don't want to pay the help

[02:39:20.780 --> 02:39:23.040]
So even Chris has got these stories now about

[02:39:23.040 --> 02:39:25.720]
Manage not getting paid and this one who else isn't getting paid

[02:39:25.720 --> 02:39:26.400]
Anybody we know

[02:39:26.400 --> 02:39:29.360]
Well your favorite friend the crow got fired

[02:39:29.360 --> 02:39:30.340]
Because he yelled at someone

[02:39:30.340 --> 02:39:32.240]
And accounting about not getting paid

[02:39:32.240 --> 02:39:35.480]
Far be it from me okay to stick up for him is the crow flies

[02:39:35.480 --> 02:39:36.220]
But you know something

[02:39:36.220 --> 02:39:39.240]
He never did nothing to me except come around and smell real bad

[02:39:39.240 --> 02:39:39.860]
I'll say that

[02:39:41.480 --> 02:39:41.880]
567

[02:39:42.640 --> 02:39:43.040]
Oh

[02:39:44.280 --> 02:39:44.680]
860

[02:39:44.680 --> 02:39:47.580]
Oh is the word man he didn't belong on here even to say hello

[02:39:47.580 --> 02:39:49.140]
Oh 560

[02:39:49.140 --> 02:39:51.600]
Or even I got to crow ball it's right here home boy

[02:39:51.600 --> 02:39:52.820]
But that seems to be the especially

[02:39:52.820 --> 02:39:58.000]
The beauty of the beast is putting people on there sound really annoying and dope along on there in the first place

[02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:03.220]
And especially in his case he was a former ball player or a jackstack for a Montreal for a long time

[02:40:03.220 --> 02:40:05.460]
Give me the crow give me the ball give me the crow

[02:40:06.100 --> 02:40:10.060]
As the crow flies we have 1437 votes which is a pretty spiffy total

[02:40:10.060 --> 02:40:13.340]
Even though we did cheat we started yesterday I don't know one o'clock with this pull

[02:40:13.720 --> 02:40:15.600]
We cheated is that cheating no

[02:40:16.540 --> 02:40:17.020]
Doesn't matter

[02:40:17.020 --> 02:40:20.980]
I used to do whatever the hell we want we got 1389 friends that are my space paid

[02:40:20.980 --> 02:40:24.280]
We need another 11 for 1400 that's not gonna happen this week

[02:40:25.200 --> 02:40:26.340]
See that that was unrealistic

[02:40:27.300 --> 02:40:31.480]
Because when I when I do that when I started inviting people around and then we get all these hookers that get on there

[02:40:31.920 --> 02:40:35.820]
And how do you know their hookers it's pretty obvious when they were hitting it's fairly obvious

[02:40:35.820 --> 02:40:40.420]
They all look the same they all say the same crap it usually all comes from the same place

[02:40:41.460 --> 02:40:45.000]
Yeah looks like one person yesterday I thought was hooker and she was so insistent

[02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:50.000]
She said many of the things three times told me she loves the show and but I mean but I finally put her on

[02:40:50.000 --> 02:40:51.480]
She doesn't sound like a hooker

[02:40:51.480 --> 02:40:53.580]
The hooker stuff is all very form you know

[02:40:53.580 --> 02:40:55.560]
I'll tell you one thing you're like her when you see her

[02:40:55.560 --> 02:40:59.600]
Well there's ten kids with their families year after year we've had millions of people

[02:40:59.600 --> 02:41:02.660]
Living in fear day after day

[02:41:02.660 --> 02:41:07.800]
Wearing that they could be deported like the hundreds of people that were deported

[02:41:07.800 --> 02:41:09.580]
They lived in New Bedford Massachusetts

[02:41:09.580 --> 02:41:12.360]
New Bedford year after year we had an underground account

[02:41:12.360 --> 02:41:16.440]
That hurts American workers and not uses hard working

[02:41:16.440 --> 02:41:20.440]
I got noticed where I get you I bet you there's like a hundred thousand drugs releases

[02:41:21.220 --> 02:41:22.260]
Right right

[02:41:22.900 --> 02:41:26.800]
Just like I was going to I'm trying to send you that thing yesterday morning remember that Ricky Tiki email

[02:41:26.800 --> 02:41:27.900]
Because you were so I'm proud of Jorge

[02:41:27.900 --> 02:41:30.380]
I probably shouldn't tell them that I sent it to you because they know you know

[02:41:31.100 --> 02:41:31.460]
What?

[02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:36.940]
I don't know sometimes people get nervous if somebody if somebody forwards or copies and paste

[02:41:36.940 --> 02:41:39.120]
Love whether you're mistress or something maybe they're not that

[02:41:39.120 --> 02:41:40.700]
We know I'm going to get nose

[02:41:43.380 --> 02:41:46.180]
We could have made fifteen hundred a Chris Damott

[02:41:46.180 --> 02:41:49.540]
I want you to promise us now that you're going to be a lot more positive

[02:41:49.540 --> 02:41:53.340]
Okay, in the days and months to come and I don't want to give carried away too far

[02:41:53.340 --> 02:41:55.000]
Don't be a lot more positive how's that?

[02:41:55.020 --> 02:41:57.080]
No, I'm serious don't pick a low number

[02:41:57.080 --> 02:41:59.500]
So if you pick a high number we didn't make it a something to shoot for

[02:41:59.500 --> 02:42:02.420]
Okay, I think I want you to get down if we don't hit that number

[02:42:02.420 --> 02:42:05.940]
I'm going to get down if we don't get fifteen hundred votes we're not going to do it now

[02:42:06.540 --> 02:42:10.360]
We need we need sixty one and twenty minutes there isn't a China-Mence chance in hell we're going to do that

[02:42:10.360 --> 02:42:11.580]
And who's brought in here?

[02:42:12.440 --> 02:42:15.540]
Fourteen hundred was the first target so we made that one

[02:42:16.460 --> 02:42:21.120]
Yeah, fourteen forty we need sixty votes and twenty minutes we couldn't do that

[02:42:21.120 --> 02:42:24.240]
That would be like going in the backyard and finding forty million dollars and cash

[02:42:24.240 --> 02:42:27.900]
Small bills, pockets and pockets

[02:42:28.940 --> 02:42:30.580]
Biggest personnel home

[02:42:30.580 --> 02:42:33.380]
All the rushers are in the kitchen and the gym

[02:42:33.380 --> 02:42:35.740]
Four-trivial five-second seat

[02:42:35.740 --> 02:42:36.820]
You way out

[02:42:36.820 --> 02:42:39.140]
Commandage, I f**king come out

[02:42:41.640 --> 02:42:44.260]
You wanted more and you got it

[02:42:44.260 --> 02:42:48.620]
The mad dog is back singing more duet on the candid seat

[02:42:48.620 --> 02:42:50.060]
All you do

[02:42:58.940 --> 02:43:03.120]
Old number eighties is back tearing off with the great

[02:43:03.120 --> 02:43:07.520]
Singing more, taking it with even more big stars

[02:43:07.520 --> 02:43:10.080]
The mad dog does them all

[02:43:28.220 --> 02:43:30.260]
All right

[02:43:30.260 --> 02:43:33.720]
All right

[02:43:33.720 --> 02:43:33.920]
All right

[02:43:33.920 --> 02:43:34.560]
All right

[02:43:34.560 --> 02:43:35.160]
All right

[02:43:35.160 --> 02:43:35.200]
All right

[02:43:35.200 --> 02:43:37.340]
All right

[02:43:37.340 --> 02:43:39.720]
It's an all new British invasion

[02:43:39.720 --> 02:43:43.720]
With the mad dog singing like a man

[02:43:45.400 --> 02:43:46.260]
I like it

[02:43:46.260 --> 02:43:48.640]
I like it

[02:43:48.640 --> 02:43:54.100]
The truth is finally out that gymnetic was truly the fifth beat

[02:43:54.100 --> 02:43:57.680]
You got to give me little love and give me little love

[02:43:57.680 --> 02:43:58.100]
Oh

[02:43:58.720 --> 02:44:00.900]
If you want to love the land

[02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:05.140]
And now your head should stay

[02:44:05.720 --> 02:44:07.580]
You always can be safe

[02:44:07.580 --> 02:44:08.860]
You can be all right

[02:44:08.860 --> 02:44:10.160]
All right

[02:44:13.580 --> 02:44:17.520]
Here's the mad dog's tender and touching tribute to the king

[02:44:17.520 --> 02:44:19.300]
He is a little bit

[02:44:19.300 --> 02:44:21.080]
All right

[02:44:21.800 --> 02:44:23.140]
All right

[02:44:24.040 --> 02:44:27.700]
There's a dragon in the morning

[02:44:27.700 --> 02:44:30.540]
He waited to do

[02:44:30.540 --> 02:44:34.020]
The mad dog was just a little end-ivalent

[02:44:34.020 --> 02:44:36.160]
But we asked him if he wanted to do it again

[02:44:36.160 --> 02:44:38.060]
And now I don't think so

[02:44:38.060 --> 02:44:40.740]
So we had looked at Rousey Payne a little visit

[02:44:40.740 --> 02:44:44.660]
And tell him either his brains or his signature would wide up on the contract

[02:44:44.660 --> 02:44:46.860]
That's some of a fistless cute

[02:44:49.480 --> 02:44:50.580]
All right

[02:44:53.580 --> 02:44:54.700]
All right

[02:44:54.700 --> 02:44:56.120]
All right

[02:44:56.120 --> 02:44:58.600]
All right

[02:44:59.160 --> 02:44:59.900]
And it's this

[02:44:59.900 --> 02:45:01.260]
What do you do?

[02:45:01.420 --> 02:45:03.420]
Available now if you move quickly

[02:45:03.420 --> 02:45:04.540]
All right

[02:45:04.540 --> 02:45:06.620]
All right

[02:45:06.620 --> 02:45:08.560]
All right

[02:45:08.560 --> 02:45:09.740]
All right

[02:45:09.740 --> 02:45:10.640]
All right

[02:45:10.640 --> 02:45:11.400]
All right

[02:45:11.400 --> 02:45:12.300]
All right

[02:45:12.300 --> 02:45:19.420]
All right

[02:45:20.520 --> 02:45:20.980]
147

[02:45:20.980 --> 02:45:25.480]
We got the mainiac of the diamond of the gridiron coming up next mad dog from 2 to 5 today

[02:45:25.480 --> 02:45:27.060]
And then we got Keldie after that

[02:45:27.060 --> 02:45:27.820]
Well nothing's perfect

[02:45:28.480 --> 02:45:32.940]
You know I'm just thinking what we're going to do tomorrow regardless of whether they take your hammer out which I'm sure they won't

[02:45:33.360 --> 02:45:33.940]
All right

[02:45:33.940 --> 02:45:34.480]
We'll play all yeah

[02:45:34.480 --> 02:45:35.920]
Because I don't want to play this the whole day

[02:45:35.920 --> 02:45:38.880]
Oh, it's all right

[02:45:38.880 --> 02:45:41.160]
There's one thing you know me I don't like playing a bit too often

[02:45:42.440 --> 02:45:42.800]
Right

[02:45:42.800 --> 02:45:44.380]
Let's play a little bit different with that

[02:45:44.380 --> 02:45:46.540]
But we'll play all the book of Brambits

[02:45:46.540 --> 02:45:47.260]
There you go

[02:45:47.260 --> 02:45:48.340]
An honor of chicken egg

[02:45:48.940 --> 02:45:50.680]
Just just show them what for

[02:45:50.680 --> 02:45:51.600]
Just to show them a thing

[02:45:51.600 --> 02:45:52.940]
Just to jam it to them

[02:45:52.940 --> 02:45:53.300]
Okay

[02:45:53.820 --> 02:45:55.040]
Jam on it

[02:45:55.040 --> 02:45:57.280]
What's your ungrateful bastard roast

[02:45:58.300 --> 02:45:59.020]
Fools idiots

[02:45:59.620 --> 02:46:05.200]
Got that fools rush in by Rick Nelson boy. He does a bad job. That's a lot of bad song with he sings it weekly week

[02:46:05.620 --> 02:46:06.960]
Really don't make me play it again

[02:46:06.960 --> 02:46:08.600]
Don't do it. I know you did the other day

[02:46:08.600 --> 02:46:11.140]
I'm so sorry you found it still scarred by it

[02:46:11.140 --> 02:46:15.740]
Now did you ever find I'm going to sit right down and write myself a letter by the Billy Williams quartet? No

[02:46:15.740 --> 02:46:16.240]
No

[02:46:17.420 --> 02:46:19.220]
That's the amnesty record

[02:46:19.220 --> 02:46:19.700]
What?

[02:46:20.020 --> 02:46:20.360]
And I tried

[02:46:21.040 --> 02:46:24.240]
I'm going to sit right down. It's a, you know stupid as old song

[02:46:24.240 --> 02:46:27.020]
Billy Williams quartet. I would say like 5758

[02:46:28.580 --> 02:46:31.700]
Back when I was a child back when I was about 40 1957

[02:46:32.980 --> 02:46:40.720]
1448 we made 15 and we're easy if you'd let me lean on it if you'd just calmly let me go by my intuition crispy like always holding back holding back

[02:46:40.720 --> 02:46:45.120]
No, no, like stepping on a break like Eric does up there when we have a big chunk of votes coming in

[02:46:45.120 --> 02:46:46.980]
He always steps on the break to slow it down

[02:46:46.980 --> 02:46:48.060]
Well now I've learned

[02:46:49.520 --> 02:46:51.360]
You learned your lesson a hard way man

[02:46:52.460 --> 02:46:58.800]
The fat hard way well now you know we could have done it and my right is there any doubt we have 40 48

[02:46:58.800 --> 02:47:01.360]
Only 52 and of course my new goal is 1450

[02:47:03.600 --> 02:47:10.500]
So you said 1350 I said 1450 which means we still need two more they probably are laying off of the thing now, you know?

[02:47:10.500 --> 02:47:15.060]
Because they were I mean why do they want to think about me croaking anyway except for those people that hated me like poison

[02:47:15.060 --> 02:47:18.880]
Which is a substantial number well that's back up again 5.8%

[02:47:18.880 --> 02:47:22.560]
He was a rotten bastard good riddance like that

[02:47:24.040 --> 02:47:27.360]
If this thing no kid to 1450 though it's going to be pretty embarrassing of it

[02:47:27.820 --> 02:47:31.660]

I'm going to sit right down in a right F***

[02:48:49.800 --> 02:48:51.740]
I'm going to sit right down in a right seventy

[02:48:51.740 --> 02:48:53.180]
What did I actually found it?

[02:48:54.620 --> 02:48:56.200]
Weird F*** I found it

[02:48:56.200 --> 02:48:58.060]
When you

[02:48:58.060 --> 02:48:59.500]
When you

[02:49:00.360 --> 02:49:03.500]
I'm going to write words so so smooth

[02:49:03.500 --> 02:49:08.080]
What 57 be 57 I had it right on the money

[02:49:12.080 --> 02:49:14.860]
Sometimes I just shocked the hell out of myself I'm so

[02:49:22.020 --> 02:49:27.540]
Yeah, it's electrified or is it petrified like the petrified force it's old and craggy

[02:49:28.340 --> 02:49:29.460]
I'm a sugar

[02:49:29.460 --> 02:49:35.060]
I know that now let's see. I got I got to figure this out. I got a back time this and now what are you what are you gonna play

[02:49:36.380 --> 02:49:41.340]
At the end of the break because that's what screws me up some days. Well, how long would you like?

[02:49:42.740 --> 02:49:43.140]
short

[02:49:43.140 --> 02:49:46.540]
A short rejoin can you handle that?

[02:49:47.120 --> 02:49:51.640]
He can give me the whole the whole break time. What's the shortest one you got just give him the whole break time

[02:49:51.640 --> 02:49:55.080]
So he can time it the whole break time is four minutes and eight seconds

[02:49:56.360 --> 02:49:59.880]
How's that possibly gonna eight second rejoin correct the money down eight

[02:50:02.300 --> 02:50:05.200]
Second rejoin and you've been playing these long. What's that thing with the weekend?

[02:50:05.440 --> 02:50:09.600]
We got on it. It's got the lineup for everybody the even the janitors name of the 26 seconds long

[02:50:09.600 --> 02:50:15.680]
Well, what is that for what's the purpose of that nobody cares about that job? Yes, they do who does

[02:50:17.100 --> 02:50:22.360]
All the sports nerds care about it. You mean the ones that won't come in here and tell you four minutes and eight seconds

[02:50:23.460 --> 02:50:27.520]
And then I got a 14 here so that's 14 for four for 22

[02:50:28.220 --> 02:50:33.440]
So that's 55 30 AC the audience has learned something you're about back timing and that's not right

[02:50:35.620 --> 02:50:42.580]
422 and two more minutes is 622 so 53 38 it would be really something if I was talking in the thing when when rushing on by

[02:50:42.580 --> 02:50:44.540]
Wouldn't it if I just got all caught up in my own BS

[02:50:44.540 --> 02:50:49.420]
It won't happen you'll see yeah, we'd limited a couple of spots

[02:50:50.840 --> 02:50:53.680]
Just a limited a couple of spots. We got to get the bid on again

[02:50:54.700 --> 02:50:58.980]
