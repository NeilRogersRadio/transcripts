[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]
I get in and hold it.

[00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:06.620]
Your evil clearance and evil doer.

[00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:08.820]
You schmuckled.

[00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:11.280]
Jim McGreeby's eggs was bitter.

[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.800]
Said she never had a clue.

[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.580]
Even in his body glitter.

[00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:24.280]
He never knew she married an H.O.M.O.

[00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:25.860]
You're fair, Jack.

[00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.820]
You're a man. He's a gay American.

[00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.180]
Absolutely.

[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:31.640]
The dean of.

[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.660]
Never knew why her holy has braille and pain.

[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.220]
Said she always looked delicious.

[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:41.000]
Huh?

[00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.660]
And everything was fine and bad.

[00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.360]
But she should have been suspicious.

[00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.640]
Sometimes when they made love he called his friend.

[00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.180]
She married an H.O.M.O.

[00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.400]
Gates.

[00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.740]
He's a gay American.

[00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.560]
A dean of.

[00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.500]
This should provide your holy love for her strife and.

[00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.420]
When she told a brother story.

[00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.600]
How about we told her he was gay.

[00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.180]
He seemed a better fit for Maureen.

[00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.360]
Only thing missing was the D.N.

[00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.220]
Then she married an H.O.M.O.

[00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.900]
You're fair, she will man.

[00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.840]
He's a gay American.

[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:28.320]
All right.

[00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:29.560]
The dean of.

[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.820]
Now you know why he went camping with his close friends.

[00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.780]
And you married an H.O.M.O.

[00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:39.500]
Sexual man.

[00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.460]
He's a gay American.

[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.160]
I used to dress like Peter Pan.

[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.660]
Because he's a gay American.

[00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.500]
He put the Peter and Peter Pan.

[00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.220]
I just pulled a Dan Stewart there.

[00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:54.520]
Not Dan Stewart, Chris Baker.

[00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.900]
Did you Dan Stewart?

[00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.240]
He's all wear fly.

[00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.880]
You'll dead.

[00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.580]
No, actually I started talking.

[00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:00.420]
I had to mic off.

[00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:02.860]
I'll do that all the time.

[00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:04.060]
Do you really?

[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:05.500]
Not by intent.

[00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.180]
No, I'm thinking of some music into the ballgame music.

[00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:09.880]
We'll start playing it now.

[00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.520]
We only got an hour 27 minutes.

[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:13.840]
You're going to be kidding us Neil.

[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.400]
And guess what?

[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.200]
I got the phone thing shut off.

[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.140]
I'm not even looking at it.

[00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:18.040]
All right.

[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.240]
When the day comes that I do an hour and a half show and I need to take any of these horseball

[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.700]
phone calls, that will be the day I say, bye bye.

[00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.180]
Like Ricky Tiki says, well I was thinking of that tomorrow is his last day.

[00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.240]
You want him to call it of course, like you said.

[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:31.280]
Yeah.

[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:32.340]
You're going to set it up?

[00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.680]
Yes.

[00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.980]
Won't that be special?

[00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.400]
Yes.

[00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.760]
Now he's not going to do that kissy kissy he does all the time.

[00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:38.000]
Probably.

[00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:39.580]
And he's obsessed with me.

[00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.360]
And this is a guy seriously way back in the beginning when I was at I.N.Z.

[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.860]
I wish I still had that clip where he said it's just shock radio.

[00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:47.380]
Remember that?

[00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.320]
He hated what I was doing because I got off of that horrible.

[00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.920]
It's a lie.

[00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.580]
I am not.

[00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.320]
A horrible old fashioned with a stupid old guest.

[00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:56.260]
Guest are killer.

[00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:57.940]
But of course these people listen to me.

[00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.400]
I know nothing.

[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.660]
The man dog was right about that and obviously forced a bunch of guests on him.

[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.020]
Now he's number is in the crap or two.

[00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.340]
These people, whatever I say, if I said it's Thursday they'll say, oh it must be Monday.

[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.240]
What could be the time?

[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.460]
Monday must be Belgium or some crap like that.

[00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.800]
I don't know.

[00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.220]
And that's because they're idiots and they can be as dumb as they want to be.

[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.680]
I don't care.

[00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.860]
And my check did show up a day early yesterday for those who keep track.

[00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.300]
So the fact that I have this very serious gambling problem according to half a dozen lunatics

[00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:24.840]
and morons in the audience.

[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.400]
I'm going off the woodmine at 1130.

[00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.460]
I got my shirt on, my pantaloonies on, I got my shoes sitting right off here to the

[00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.920]
chide.

[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:34.940]
And I'm ready to rock and roll baby.

[00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.760]
And hour and 26 minutes and we'll be out of here.

[00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.180]
Marlon's baseball ought to get a huge number, especially without exciting Dave and

[00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.480]
Warren and Foxy Roxy with that squeaky yellow light voice.

[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.680]
Okay, here's the poor result from yesterday.

[00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:48.880]
I guess we don't have time to dittle around too much here today.

[00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.680]
No, but let's do it anyway.

[00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:56.000]
And I was supposed to say at the very beginning because I was eye-emming with Brandon last night.

[00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:57.300]
He asked me what did I have for lunch.

[00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.800]
Although he knows that I was under a lot of stress at lunch.

[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:02.960]
What are you laughing about?

[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.520]
Oh, I, Chris was making a funny face.

[00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.960]
Yeah.

[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.420]
Oh, man, I'm never going to be the same again.

[00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:11.960]
Well, I just had some interesting messages that so.

[00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:13.600]
But so I take that.

[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.180]
I had a bowl of raw cream of broccoli soup with some little cheddar cheese in it.

[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.820]
Man, it was good.

[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.560]
And I had, they bring a big salad, the cheese your salad along because I had, you're going

[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.200]
to be very angry when I tell you what I had.

[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.060]
I had a huge meal.

[00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.600]
Oh, cheese.

[00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:32.760]
I had Penny pasta with sausage and dessert.

[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.800]
Oh, guy, I had a, huh?

[00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:35.880]
Keep going.

[00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.440]
The score Sunday for dessert.

[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:38.720]
Oh, my God.

[00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.400]
I have waddled out of there.

[00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:46.000]
But at least, at least it brought my, I don't know, adjusted my mood.

[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.820]
Yeah, I don't know what to say.

[00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:50.980]
Anyway, let's get going.

[00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:52.600]
We don't have a lot of yucks in there.

[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.620]
A lot of yucks and a lot of schmucks.

[00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:57.840]
1668 votes on yesterday's pool.

[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.800]
So all this crap, you know, we're still kicking a fanny old style.

[00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.480]
Remember, fanny's farmer or farmer's fanny farmer?

[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.660]
Sure.

[00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.220]
They had candy, by the way, fanny farmer.

[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.660]
Goes to show you when you were a kid, your parents will feed you any kind of crap to them.

[00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.520]
Hey, that's really good, my fanny farmer.

[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:14.140]
Oh, brother.

[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.920]
That's very big in the Northeast and upstate New York, it was big and in Boston.

[00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.360]
I guess maybe there are headquarters in Boston.

[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:21.120]
You want to Google it?

[00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:21.820]
Okay.

[00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:23.240]
Fanny farmer candies.

[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:24.340]
Boston, very big.

[00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.860]
In fact, there's a fanny farmer still on, I think Washington Street in Boston, you know,

[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:29.780]
the main, well, whatever.

[00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:31.720]
We're the Paul Revere House, too.

[00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:35.380]
Let's go see Paul Revere, the British are coming and boy, the boss is not too happy about it.

[00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:35.540]
What?

[00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:36.340]
Boss, I told you.

[00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:38.820]
When I tell you, I know my farmer's fanny, man.

[00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:43.360]
Anyway, the opponent yesterday, we had 1688 votes.

[00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.180]
I'm the owner of an overactive sex drive, 381.

[00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:46.980]
Nothing wrong with that.

[00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:48.200]
Keep that baby going, man.

[00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.660]
Keep, that's what the Lord put it there for and make it work.

[00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:51.860]
Make it work for you.

[00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:53.300]
Like that.

[00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.280]
Balu, be selective.

[00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:00.860]
I'm never going to be the same.

[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.280]
I just, my life has changed.

[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:06.100]
Not for the better either, just, they're all wondering what am I talking about.

[00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:11.100]
Nothing that actually happened or is going to happen, just a bizarre series of messages.

[00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:12.720]
Sex drive 381.

[00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:17.940]
Nothing overactive with me, 242 people, holier than all the rest of us, better than us.

[00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:20.940]
So I screwed up, that's the third day and it's only the tenth of May.

[00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:23.700]
So seven days in May, remember that was not a movie?

[00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:24.520]
Seven days in May?

[00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:25.680]
I don't remember.

[00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.340]
Yeah, or a book or something.

[00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:30.760]
Seven days in May, I've been perfect with the no sugar and the other three days.

[00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:31.800]
And yesterday was disaster.

[00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:33.760]
I mean, I'm not lying about it.

[00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:35.000]
If I'm lying, you're dying.

[00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:38.580]
I'm an overactive craving for food, 225.

[00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:41.360]
That was yesterday, but I think it was, I think you get a free pass on that.

[00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:43.980]
If I could tell them the whole, which I won't.

[00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:47.240]
I'm the owner of an overactive fart maker, 182.

[00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:49.200]
Imagination 145.

[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:50.940]
Oh, that's most of you people, by the way.

[00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:51.680]
I love these people.

[00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:53.520]
I'll throw a little tidbit on there.

[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:55.260]
Oh, we know what you're talking about.

[00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:57.200]
We know you're a compulsive gambler.

[00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.380]
You lose in thousands, whatever you say.

[00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:02.320]
We do have a couple of compulsive gamblers on the radio station.

[00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:03.580]
I'm not one of them, but anyway.

[00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:08.000]
Owner of an overactive bladder, 141, peeing a lot.

[00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:08.860]
What's the nightly news?

[00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:14.180]
You'll have 500 commercials on there for the pills that stop you from peeing so much.

[00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:16.260]
Overactive bowel, 77.

[00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:18.360]
Sweat gland, 74.

[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:19.960]
Mental disorder, 46.

[00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:21.680]
Nervous system 38.

[00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:26.580]
Impulsed to call radio talk shows with nothing to say, 34.

[00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:28.380]
Even legendary talk shows like this one.

[00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:29.720]
Paranoia 30.

[00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:30.460]
30.

[00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:32.420]
There's 29.

[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.960]
I'm assuming that's for booze.

[00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:36.340]
I don't know.

[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:37.920]
I mean, what does that mean overactive bowel?

[00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:39.600]
Maybe you have acid and booze.

[00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:40.700]
Maybe you have diet, BBs.

[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:42.140]
Hypocondria 14.

[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:43.400]
I mean, as in I'm always saying,

[00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:44.480]
I'm diet on the hand.

[00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:45.440]
And thyroid 10.

[00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:48.080]
Well, it's nice to see thyroid bring it up to rear if I can say that.

[00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:48.880]
Farmers fanny.

[00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:50.880]
Have you ever had fanny farmer chocolates?

[00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:52.700]
I'm sure I must have.

[00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:54.120]
They're like industrial strength.

[00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:54.640]
They're very right.

[00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:56.260]
And you know what other candy is really bad?

[00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:57.100]
Whitman Samper.

[00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:58.160]
Oh, yeah.

[00:07:58.600 --> 00:07:58.960]
Yeah.

[00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:00.520]
Like a biome in the Walgreens.

[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:01.640]
Yeah.

[00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:02.600]
And right exactly.

[00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:04.000]
Nothing worse than Mushi Candyman.

[00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:05.540]
Yeah, let's talk about this.

[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:06.060]
I'm talking about this.

[00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:08.760]
He's a day number four perfect atkins for me so far.

[00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:09.880]
Excellent. Let's hear it for George.

[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:11.320]
He's doing the actions.

[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:12.260]
I'm trimming it.

[00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:14.860]
Well, I think if you'd have gotten the messages I did, you probably would have gone off.

[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:16.520]
Yeah, I would have vomited.

[00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:18.420]
So I would have lost even more weight.

[00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:19.320]
Now, you know what I'm sorry.

[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:20.600]
I didn't tell anybody about that.

[00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:21.020]
Right?

[00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:22.680]
Except everybody I know.

[00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:24.000]
Well, what would you expect?

[00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:26.440]
I mean, you know, we come up with something like that.

[00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:30.400]
A Boulder Colorado high school is locked down.

[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:31.140]
I have a heavy.

[00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:32.340]
The kids aren't in there.

[00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:35.620]
Just the staff and administrative faculty and above whatever they call it.

[00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:37.420]
But anyway, it's on lockdown.

[00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:40.240]
There's some suspicious incident in Boulder, Colorado.

[00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:42.020]
And they showed all the SWAT team running in there.

[00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:42.920]
Who knows what's going on.

[00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:45.820]
They found some suspicious light powder on the Blackboard.

[00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:48.360]
It was called chalk, but nevertheless, there's something going on there.

[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:50.380]
Here's the pool today.

[00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:53.880]
We only got an hour and twenty-one minutes and then it'll be Marlon's baseball, baby.

[00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:55.920]
What have we got after the Marlon's today?

[00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:58.640]
We got the, oh, wow, wow, wow.

[00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:00.280]
Oh, no, no, wait a minute.

[00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:01.400]
Huh?

[00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:03.680]
Look at this schedule.

[00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:04.740]
I want you to look at the schedule.

[00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:05.380]
I'm looking.

[00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:09.260]
Beast 330-7, active of all game.

[00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:10.760]
And then Hank 4-7.

[00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:11.620]
What are they going to do?

[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.140]
I've got a correction.

[00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:15.040]
Oh, I don't.

[00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:16.400]
Okay, yeah, 330-4.

[00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:17.920]
And then Hank 4-7.

[00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:19.800]
Oh, 330-4, the beast.

[00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:22.260]
So Hank couldn't work the extra half hour.

[00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:23.000]
Come on, Humber.

[00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:25.580]
We'll work off a few calories for a crying out loud, Faso.

[00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:26.080]
No.

[00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:28.020]
We're trying to keep him alive so desperately.

[00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:32.640]
No, I realize you can't do it because you failed so many times and I killed with that rich.

[00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:33.720]
I mean, I tried everything.

[00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:36.280]
You tell me something that, you know, that I can try the lockdown.

[00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:38.220]
Yeah, well that's the only thing we did.

[00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:40.700]
The school workers saw two masked men entering the school.

[00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:41.360]
They were in Boulder.

[00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:42.460]
They just put that on CNN.

[00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:43.500]
Two masked men.

[00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:45.780]
Oh, I sure hope it wasn't Batman and Robin.

[00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:49.000]
If it was Robin, maybe I can catch a little or something, something.

[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:52.060]
Anyway, 685 votes on the pool.

[00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:53.260]
Who is the most obsessed?

[00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:54.620]
I like this pool just fine.

[00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:55.720]
Who's this from?

[00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:57.040]
Is this Charlie Beagan?

[00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:57.960]
Well, the most important.

[00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:00.280]
No, actually it's...

[00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:01.440]
No, this is the one from Sean.

[00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:02.160]
Thank you, Sean.

[00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:02.800]
That is a good one.

[00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:04.840]
Let's at least give Sean credit where credit is true.

[00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:06.380]
685 on the pool.

[00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:07.780]
They will never get to 1000 by 1130.

[00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:08.980]
Even Chris knows that.

[00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:10.300]
Don't you correct?

[00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:11.740]
And doesn't care either.

[00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:14.060]
Oh, now what's the deal with the food?

[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:15.380]
Oh, that was yesterday, right?

[00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:16.220]
Chick-fil-A came in?

[00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:16.780]
Yeah, they did.

[00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:17.640]
Very nice.

[00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:18.040]
Fine.

[00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:19.520]
Having their grand opening of that.

[00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:20.540]
I keep hearing about the handle rate.

[00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:21.080]
That's the office.

[00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:21.900]
I've never had it.

[00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:22.500]
It's very good.

[00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:24.780]
I wonder if we have Chick-fil-A here.

[00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:26.020]
I think we can do it with the grand opening.

[00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:30.580]
One of the food courts, I think there's a chick who's getting filleted or just laid.

[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:32.480]
Who's the most obsessed?

[00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:34.940]
Cuban Americans about Fidel Castro, 353.

[00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:37.220]
New Yorkers, anything new, you walk 120.

[00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:40.200]
There's nothing more obnoxious than an obnoxious new walker.

[00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:41.740]
And we apologize for the redundancy.

[00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:42.980]
128.

[00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:44.980]
Jews about Israel, 122.

[00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:46.960]
Jews, what do you think?

[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:47.400]
Oi!

[00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.520]
Lou Dobbs about illegal immigration only 40?

[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:51.920]
Oh, he ought to be doing better than that.

[00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:53.720]
That's what I voted for, as a matter of fact.

[00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:55.380]
I've assessed as the understable century.

[00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:58.880]
Richard Mellonscape about the Clintons, 23.

[00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:01.100]
Game in, Judy Garland, 11.

[00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:03.220]
Mell Gibson about the Jews, 8.

[00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:04.560]
That's pretty good pull.

[00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:06.100]
There's some other things that could be on it.

[00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:08.040]
How about Neil Rogers and Brady Quinn?

[00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:10.280]
Put that on there.

[00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:12.040]
I can take the shots and bother me.

[00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:12.740]
Hey, Brady.

[00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:15.720]
Pretty or what a shame.

[00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:17.620]
Who's this goofball Mormon he brought in?

[00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:19.920]
There's quarterback John Beck.

[00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:20.900]
Is that the guy's name, Chris?

[00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:21.420]
John Beck?

[00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:22.160]
Yes.

[00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:23.880]
Well, who the hell ever heard of him?

[00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:24.660]
Rhymes with Dreck.

[00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:30.300]
12 minutes after 10, a QM an hour, 20 minutes away from the first run out of the pregame show.

[00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:31.340]
Don't keep carried away now.

[00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:35.720]
So the Beast 330 to 4, Humper 4 to 7, Hurricane Hotline 78.

[00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:36.620]
Any interest in that?

[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:36.960]
No.

[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:38.980]
And Jimmy Cifilus 8 to 10 tonight.

[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:39.540]
All right.

[00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:41.200]
Now is that his first show on the station, Chris?

[00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:44.320]
I'm going to say yes.

[00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:49.060]
Since abandoning those losers across the street, Jimmy Cifilus 8 to 10.

[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:51.620]
And then game net with 8K 10 till 1 a.m.

[00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:52.740]
No, no, no, no.

[00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:53.740]
No, God.

[00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:56.700]
They see they'll keep up all their injuries.

[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.880]
Until they expose all the secrecy.

[00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:05.440]
Still they're not hearing what they want to hear.

[00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:09.560]
Because no one talks while under open air.

[00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:13.980]
Is it true the FBI knew about the press?

[00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:17.920]
Did CIA make judgments that they now regret?

[00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:22.000]
There's a lot of things that we can't do.

[00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:27.600]
We need to know.

[00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:29.700]
We need to know.

[00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:33.200]
What push knew about 9-1-1?

[00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:34.720]
We need to know.

[00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:35.940]
We need to know.

[00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:41.560]
What push knew about 9-1-1?

[00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:43.200]
We need to know.

[00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:48.240]
Isn't it interesting until they take them about like five and a half years before they're finally saying,

[00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:49.980]
oh, you know, we think maybe they knew something.

[00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:51.100]
That's a little something, something.

[00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:52.560]
Maybe this was an inside job.

[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:55.940]
Maybe this was a bad deal gone bad between the Bushes and the Bin Laden's.

[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:03.880]
Maybe this was all a set up deal by the project for the New American Century so that we could go into a rack and just rape the damn country and pillage and loot and kill them, etc.

[00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:04.900]
All of these things.

[00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:06.760]
7-21 on the pool.

[00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:07.760]
I've already got six votes.

[00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:10.020]
The Arangers obsessed with Brady Quinn's got six votes.

[00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:11.020]
I readily admit.

[00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:15.320]
I confess to that just like I confess to my very bad damn thing prep.

[00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:20.920]
Oh man, so many ash holes and so little time.

[00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:21.920]
It's just amazing to me.

[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.080]
There's so many idiots out there.

[00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:26.500]
But I did confess about my grotesque lunch yesterday.

[00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:29.200]
I certainly didn't need dessert.

[00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:31.000]
Well, what I need dessert for.

[00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:32.840]
I guess that was just to make the cheese more binding.

[00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:34.740]
I guess just to put you over the top.

[00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:39.740]
I asked for some Parmesan cheese for my pente pasta and my with sausage.

[00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:41.060]
Which was pretty good.

[00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:46.860]
And the waitress goes away for a second and she comes back and she brings one of those cheese graters.

[00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:50.480]
This is in a deli.

[00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:51.800]
I mean, it's an okay place.

[00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:54.780]
But she's grating this thing.

[00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:58.180]
She's twisting the thing and like a little bit of cheese is pushing on there.

[00:13:58.340 --> 00:13:59.140]
A little tiny bit.

[00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:00.520]
And I finally said, okay, ask good.

[00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:01.180]
Get out of here.

[00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:01.580]
Bitch.

[00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:02.840]
Jesus.

[00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:03.460]
God almighty.

[00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:05.620]
Just bring me like a thing.

[00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:06.560]
Like a sugar bowl.

[00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:07.260]

[00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:09.020]
You know, like in a real Italian restaurant.

[00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:11.760]
I mean, in a real fancy gourmet Italian they bring in.

[00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:13.140]
They do that like she was doing.

[00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:14.080]
But they give you plenty.

[00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:15.500]
You know, they didn't know how to grate it.

[00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:16.460]
It wasn't so great.

[00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:17.700]
Let's do that.

[00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:19.680]
Little tiny tidbits of cheese.

[00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:21.140]
Yeah, I needed the extra cheese.

[00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:25.460]
Speaking of that, hundreds of homeless people in Nashville ate well last night.

[00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:28.260]
All in the name of a man who the state put it out just hours before.

[00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:29.620]
His last words were.

[00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:30.880]
I'm dying out of here.

[00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:34.840]
Philip Workman, 53, requested that his final meal be a vegetarian pizza.

[00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:35.420]
Haha.

[00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:36.820]
Haha.

[00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:42.540]
A vegetarian pizza donated to any homeless person located in the River Bend maximum security institution.

[00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:44.880]
He was executed there at two o'clock Wednesday morning.

[00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:49.020]
But prison officials refused to honor his request saying they don't donate to charities.

[00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:52.800]
That apparently upset a few people willing to pay for and deliver a lot of pies themselves.

[00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:53.680]
All right.

[00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:58.260]
Homeless shelters across Nashville were indated with donated pizzas all day yesterday.

[00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:02.380]
I was like, wow, Jesus said Marvin champion and employer of Nashville's rescue mission,

[00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:06.420]
which provides overnight shelter food and assistance to more than 800 homeless people a night.

[00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:11.300]
You know, if Jesus ordered pizzas, what would you, uh, WWJE?

[00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:12.800]
What would Jesus eat?

[00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:13.840]
I'm sure it would be kosher.

[00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:15.700]
I'm thinking not pepperoni, man.

[00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:16.540]
No, right.

[00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:17.980]
And certainly not pepperoni.

[00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:19.660]
Nothing would be cheese on it.

[00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:20.020]

[00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:20.520]
He's very brave.

[00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:22.940]
Jesus was very firm as they say.

[00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:23.840]
He would just have cheeses.

[00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:24.340]
Jesus.

[00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:25.280]
Yeah.

[00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:26.880]
Too much cheeses for Jesus.

[00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:28.280]
And that's not a bad idea.

[00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:30.420]
Let's open up a company called cheeses.

[00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:32.400]
Jesus Christ will be blessed.

[00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:35.100]
I used to be homeless, so I know how tough it gets at Marvin.

[00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:37.420]
I've seen some bad times having not enough food.

[00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:38.220]
The cupboards are beer.

[00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:40.740]
But we got pizza to feed enough people for a while, he said.

[00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:43.560]
This really shows the people here that someone out there thought of them.

[00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:46.360]
Donna Spangler heard about workmen's request.

[00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:47.540]
And immediately called her friends.

[00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:53.140]
They all pitched in for the $1,200 bill to buy 150 pizzas, which they sent to the rescue mission.

[00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:55.120]
Philip Orkman was trying to do a good deed.

[00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:55.900]
Nobody would help him.

[00:15:55.960 --> 00:16:00.120]
Said the 50-foot-hour-year-old who recruited the co-worker to help her make the message blurry last night.

[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.420]
I knew my husband went out of heart attack.

[00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:03.620]
I put some of it on the credit card.

[00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:06.020]
She said that I thought we'll find a way to pay for them later.

[00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:08.300]
I just felt like I had to do something positive.

[00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:11.020]
Some vegetarian pies.

[00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:14.440]
Spangler wasn't the only person to place an order in Orkman's name.

[00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:16.260]
The president of PETA.

[00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:18.020]
Oh, I knew how did I know.

[00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:19.840]
I was so sorry about the vegetarian pie.

[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:20.860]
I thought PETA.

[00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:21.240]
Yeah.

[00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:23.480]
PETA, the Twitter.

[00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:27.520]
We're at a new story about the President and I, the inmates' last request in order 15 feces

[00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:29.960]
pies sent to the rescue mission this morning.

[00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:32.880]
Well, they're probably chomping on them right now because it's like 9.20.

[00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:35.120]
Not even just love Nashville.

[00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:35.760]
Not.

[00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:41.020]
Workmen's act was selfless and kindness to all living beings in subvertus said PETA's president,

Dress up in this fighting costume

[00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:52.820]
Here

[00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:55.140]
In an embankment basement

[00:22:56.100 --> 00:23:00.400]
Oh, yeah they miss sniffing exhaust views

[00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:01.320]
Absolutely

[00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:05.660]
Oh, who can kill a building

[00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:07.420]
Kill a building

[00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:09.520]
In each tiny time

[00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:11.260]
In each tiny time

[00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:12.400]
Spider-Man

[00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:14.400]
Spider-Man

[00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:17.700]
Does whatever a spider can

[00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:19.320]
He's Spider-Man

[00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:23.520]
He's a weapon

[00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:25.220]
In each size

[00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:27.080]
Catching seeds

[00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:31.080]
He's Spider-Man

[00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:34.560]
He's Spider-Man

[00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:38.060]
Look out! Here comes the Spider-Man

[00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:40.640]
Oh man

[00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:43.040]
It was going so well to the last part there

[00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:44.180]
I guess you know a little campy

[00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:46.760]
I was just thinking and fantasizing while the thing was playing

[00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:49.120]
Yeah about clearance and joys

[00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:50.400]
Tied to a chair

[00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:52.620]
Tied to a chair with a rubber ball in their mouth

[00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:53.640]
Like in somebody's garage

[00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:55.600]
Alright and carbon dioxide

[00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:57.920]
With a door close of course and carbon dioxide fumes

[00:23:57.920 --> 00:23:59.700]
Just pouring out of some bebojo lobby

[00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:02.180]
A kind of wonderful fantasy

[00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:02.780]
Man

[00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:05.520]
768 votes on the pool

[00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:07.940]
And man I'm moving up the list I'm so proud of myself

[00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:10.000]
Who is the most obsessed

[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.720]
Cuban Americans with the Del Castro

[00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:12.840]
393

[00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:13.940]
Come and east, come and east

[00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:16.540]
New Yorkers with anything New York 140

[00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:18.800]
Jews with Israel 130

[00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:21.640]
Ludovs a legal immigration only 44

[00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:24.000]
He should be doing my- they don't know who the hell Ludovs is

[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.940]
You think the audience listens to us just CNL?

[00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:28.540]
No, nobody under 100 does accept you and me

[00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:29.720]
That's right and I'm getting close

[00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:31.880]
Richard Mullins gave the Clintons 25

[00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:33.240]
He's obsessed with the Clintons

[00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:34.980]
In the evil way

[00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:36.920]
Neil Rogers and Brady Quinn 14

[00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:39.560]
From nothing to 14 in two shakes of A.A.

[00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:41.000]
Asses tale, that's something

[00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:43.960]
Gay men with Judy Garland speaking of A.S. 13

[00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:45.880]
And Mel Gibson with the Jews 9

[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:47.400]
771

[00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:48.780]
I'm pretty proud of that totaler

[00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:50.980]
It's not too bad considering we only got an hour and a half show today

[00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:52.700]
Now I don't think that this is um

[00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:54.920]
I mean as much as I love this

[00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:57.480]
First of all, it's only a minute and a little something

[00:24:57.480 --> 00:24:58.980]
One thirty three

[00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:00.800]
Ready

[00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:05.520]
Start it, that's that, that's that, that's that

[00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:05.920]
That's that

[00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:07.860]
That's the only small thing

[00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:10.480]
Nothing to worry about the whole wedding period

[00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:12.480]
For your father, for your father

[00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:15.300]
What is it about that movie management?

[00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:17.320]
I don't- it's perfect, that's what

[00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:18.300]
Is it?

[00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:20.680]
It's a masterpiece, they did everything right

[00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:21.900]
You know, maybe not on purpose

[00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:25.900]
I mean if you take the original God, I don't want to say Godfather one because then somebody will say

[00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:29.460]
There is Godfather one and just call the Godfather

[00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:30.740]
Well the first one, okay

[00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:34.260]
There is nothing you can criticize

[00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:37.440]
There's no bad spots, no bad scenes, no dead spots

[00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:39.860]
Well, in a good way right

[00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:44.340]
Right, there's nothing like being dead in a good way, I like that

[00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:47.360]
Like my mother for example, she was dead in a good way

[00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:48.700]
Is that a bad thing to say?

[00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:54.540]
Oh, you're so insensitive, he didn't even go to his mother's funeral, he said such a bastard, such a cold-hearted bastard

[00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:57.520]
I'm a warm fuzzy and I'm adorable too

[00:25:58.340 --> 00:25:58.880]
That's right

[00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:00.720]
Even George says I'm adorable

[00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:02.700]
Cute as a bug's butt

[00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:09.420]
Right, oh I think maybe this will be the occlusing at eleven thirty

[00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:11.680]
No, this is what is this?

[00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:12.400]
Godfather?

[00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:14.920]
No, but it's the Godfather walls

[00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:17.580]
What's all this?

[00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:18.560]
It's 338

[00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:20.580]
Which is kind of great

[00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:26.920]
Oh I see, I think it's going to start that and I do a little chair and tell it or something

[00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:29.160]
Is this sounds like something to eat?

[00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:31.360]
Anything in Italy that sounds like that

[00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:32.600]
Yeah

[00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:36.980]
Doesn't it sound like they all, there's a whole bunch of these that all sound the same

[00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:40.240]
But you'll hear a kidy, you see any of you hear how they are trumpeting so

[00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:42.960]
Sure, quivering, it's quivering and shivering a little bit there

[00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:48.040]
Shiver me timbers man, here we go, with a bunch of real dangerous grease balls, here here comes

[00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:50.600]
Yeah, there's a man who runs

[00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:53.240]
Oh, I'm on boobie now

[00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:55.080]
Oh yeah, how is that?

[00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:57.160]
Kick pine

[00:26:58.240 --> 00:26:59.820]
Yeah, that'll do just fine, you think?

[00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:01.020]
Yeah, I like it

[00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:03.420]
It'll be just fine, although I wonder how it ends

[00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:07.320]
Well, I don't know, well you know something if I go to the next one and I go back

[00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:11.320]
The next cut, here I'm saying and I can back it up a little bit

[00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:14.100]
And we can come down

[00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:18.600]
I got to hear this for the back timing purposes

[00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:21.400]
You sure I wasted a lot of time and you only got an hour and a half

[00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:22.840]
Yeah, I have no fool man

[00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:28.000]
I was fated, it's a fade out so I'll just start it a little late, better late than never

[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.820]
Okay, we got 783 on that pool, some bad news and browored by it, away

[00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:36.780]
Freakage convergent of natural forces scores a wildfires burning across the state plus center

[00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:41.740]
By the way, the jackass that caught two days ago, that storm up there that disturbance the first name

[00:27:41.740 --> 00:27:43.520]
Yes, that's not going anywhere near you guys

[00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:43.840]
I know

[00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:48.300]
Scores a wildfire is burning across the state plus an early sub-tomperal storm in the Atlantic

[00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:52.940]
Will likely keep South Florida cloaked in a yellowish smokey pall until the weekend authority said

[00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:54.480]
Ooh, bad air

[00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:57.760]
And guess where that predicting meant for that for this summer?

[00:27:57.980 --> 00:28:00.940]
Like blackout days when the air smog is going to be so thick

[00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:04.160]
Guess where they were predicting that on the news here yesterday, not for Toronto, yeah

[00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:05.560]
Mm-hmm, oh

[00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:10.180]
Like you get up by if they see you wake up in a it's too many afternoon and you think it's like seven in the morning

[00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:13.340]
Because it's still like pitch black outside, oh, into the world

[00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:17.860]
The smoke was sticking off yesterday to push the air quality index and browored into the unhealthy range

[00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:24.480]
Prompting a warning for risen, still limit after activities especially the elderly, children and those with respiratory problems

[00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:30.100]
As soon as I left the house at 6.30 am, I smelled the fire said Maribel Fields of Pember Pines

[00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:35.580]
And outreach manager for the Broward County air quality division, you can't complain about the air quality and browing because there isn't any

[00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:40.300]
Although Palm Beach County's air quality readings weren't quite as bad officials order the same advice

[00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:46.000]
This is from a burning so I tell people to be very careful said, careful said Robert Moskovitz sounds very Jewish to me

[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.540]
An environmental specialist with the Palm Beach County Department of Health

[00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:53.300]
You know all these names that we read in these stories that I read, you know how many Jewish names there?

[00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:56.100]
I think there's like a billion Jews and we just keep it a secret

[00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:59.740]
And let's be it because the air is a good upset. I don't know they're awful lot of Jews

[00:28:59.740 --> 00:29:04.540]
The air conditions were the result of more than 80,000 naked burning state wide and wins from some tropical storm

[00:29:04.540 --> 00:29:06.300]
Andrea pushing the smoke in this direction

[00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:10.100]
I'm praying for rain so Governor Charlie Christ who spends a lot of time on his knees

[00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:13.760]
He took a helicopter to yesterday of fire, he's drinking areas

[00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:17.300]
Your Governor Charlie, he just cracks me up, you know

[00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:21.440]
I mean I don't know if he's a good guy or bad guy, he certainly got to be an improvement over his fat ass predecessor

[00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:28.900]
That's for Dan. Yeah. I mean so with anything so with no no governor would be better than that governor that wildly popular Jebediah

[00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:33.800]
Christ said 225 totaling almost 125 square miles per blaze state wide

[00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:39.920]
A Florida's burning man is absolutely like the governor maybe that maybe there's a connection there you think?

[00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:45.100]
Maybe the Lord knows the governor is a fag and as a result the whole state's going to be flaming soon we hope not

[00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:48.940]
The one most affecting South Florida covered almost 16,000 acres in the

[00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:53.180]
Picking even what is it? Picking even strand state forest in Collier County

[00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:56.500]
Wow. That's because the winds are pushing it through the East Coast

[00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:59.120]
Melissa Eunice, folks woman for the state division of forestry said

[00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:04.160]
Because of that fire alligator alley between four-large day old and Naples was close from 830 to 130 yesterday

[00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:09.340]
The FHPB sand because of the smoke as the barred public schools cancel all spring football practice yesterday

[00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:12.720]
And the middle school fag a flag football game schedule for last night

[00:30:13.220 --> 00:30:17.180]
Broward County athletic association all-star football game that was supposed to be played at Cooper City High

[00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:21.600]
We scheduled till seven o'clock tonight. I sure don't want to miss that. Nothing like those softballs

[00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:26.380]
Fire's burning in north and central Florida led Broward schools to a definitely suspend field trips to the

[00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:30.700]
Canopy Space Center St. Augustine and Jacksonville who don't want to go to any of those places anyway

[00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:33.580]
Although no wildfires broke out in Palm Beach, Broward to date on Wednesday

[00:30:33.580 --> 00:30:39.720]
Smoke from his farways the panhandle has locked it this far South. Oh brother you can just kind of smell it

[00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:44.260]
So there you go another good reason not to be there, but I don't want to get anybody depressed

[00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:50.340]
It just you know goes with the territory this places with earthquakes and mudslides and stuff like that

[00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:52.620]
No places perfect no places

[00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:58.200]
Paradise you know what I'm saying some people think they're in paradise and then they just get sent away

[00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:02.080]
By the way, I hope you're having a wonderful day moe go outside and inhale out of those fumes

[00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:08.600]
797 in fact maybe we'll just tie up our clearance and Joyce outside and they can inhale all the burning fumes instead of going

[00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:09.240]
about the camera

[00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:21.020]
I'm in jail

[00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:23.960]
Paris you dropped the soap pick it up

[00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:26.520]
Another patient nice but Paris

[00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:28.320]
What color are you in a bowl?

[00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:34.520]
So looks like you really do dye your hair Paris your curtains don't match your drapes

[00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:37.560]
It's really rude one more person asking I'm gonna get up and walk away

[00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:39.300]
And that's a week game one

[00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:41.040]
Are we gonna see blood or anything?

[00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:44.760]
It's Paris Hilton in the not so simple wife

[00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:46.320]
It looks like it's Paris actually

[00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:50.460]
We're gonna try up some filthy Lesbo lockout with bad light

[00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:53.740]
This is where she belongs in a filthy Lesbo lockdown

[00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:58.160]
1046 or you get Joyce in there with her man they can have a whip up a really wild time

[00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:04.060]
804 on the pool man I love that aren't you impressed Chris not even be like doing little tap dance in his pants?

[00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:07.220]
I know we're getting impressed by the fact that we're getting out of here in 44 minutes

[00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:14.680]
Not that I'm counting you understand not that we're trying to like scur off or like avoid doing our best to do our duty like a good scout

[00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:18.900]
But that's what they tell us you know and this is I think this is the only day of the year that we have this early of an exit

[00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:21.560]
How do we call ever having a new game to you?

[00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:26.560]
No I mean sure we must have once upon a time in America but I don't recall it

[00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:29.940]
But then again I'm old and seen now in people

[00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:34.160]
Here's a fact from a Channel 7 Hater and there's a lot of company

[00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:37.660]
Oh and the person that says putting the arrangers on the pool obsessed with W and no chance

[00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:41.160]
I mean anybody with a brain is obsessed with W and a very negative way

[00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:45.180]
So see the idea of the pool today is it speaks for itself stupid

[00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:50.640]
Anyway the Channel 7 Hater says I flipped by Channel 7 news last night and there they were on the beach in Jacksonville

[00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:52.880]
Talking up a storm about the storm

[00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:57.440]
And of course we knew it because that's a par for the course in South Florida

[00:32:57.440 --> 00:32:59.540]
Anything that's going on with an 8 million miles

[00:33:00.580 --> 00:33:01.600]
That's very funny

[00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:01.960]
Amen

[00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:03.820]
It says

[00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:07.120]
They're labeled try to cause a panic about nothing

[00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:10.500]
Spooky's in the way is a guy in drag says of the Channel 7 Hater

[00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:13.940]
Or I could be I know I get spielkeys when I see it whatever it is

[00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:21.140]
804 on the apporn I'm moving up nicely I'm climbing the ladder not that I'm in any danger to those top three choices there

[00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:24.260]
But I could come in a respectable fourth by the time all is said and done

[00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:26.720]
You know what I mean by the time it gets done

[00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:32.920]
807 I got the near Rogers obsessed with Brady Quinn 26 vote all right and I am obsessed and proud of it

[00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:35.460]
And if anybody don't like it too bad I saw him first

[00:33:36.220 --> 00:33:41.000]
Pope Benedict the 16th city yesterday the supporters oh I'm sorry he supports

[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:45.400]
Excommunication for politicians who back Mexico City's decision to legalize abortion

[00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:50.760]
Giving a strong message about court church teachings as it started his first trip to Latin America's pontiff

[00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:55.440]
This far bison Nazi Pope with the little red shoes he looks so cute he's adorable

[00:33:56.560 --> 00:34:03.980]
Church of teaching calls for automatic excommunication for anyone who has an abortion in Mexico City where abortion was legalized during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy

[00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:10.440]
Church officials have said that doctors nurses who performed a procedure as well as lawmakers who supported civilization would also be excommunicated

[00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:17.260]
You're gonna burn in hell that's right that's the church for you baby they get very angry just like the Lord they get pissed off

[00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:26.160]
The power of Christ compel you right the power of Christ compel you the power of Christ compel you

[00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:33.220]
Yeah the power of Christ compel you huh the power of Christ compel you

[00:34:33.220 --> 00:34:47.240]
Oh, the power of Christ compel you the power of Christ compel you

[00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:56.860]
Are you sure the power of Christ compel you the power of Christ compel you

[00:34:56.860 --> 00:35:04.440]
Incrably the power of Christ compel you oh we're fine the power of Christ compel you

[00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:10.620]
All right father Mary and wants to hit no more I won't see either one of them now is the old one he's not dead yet is he

[00:35:10.620 --> 00:35:17.320]
Max on side out oh very good next one see now side out I don't know we don't know if he's dead or alive you can look it up

[00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:27.520]
V.O.N.S.Y.D.O.W. but anyway father carousas dead Jason Miller wasn't at the guy boy my mind is really sharp today I wouldn't be surprised if I sniffed out a decent machine today

[00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:33.840]
And I got some very bad news for me guess what I found out on Tuesday when I had my first losing day of the weekend would buy him

[00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:39.540]
He's still alive who Max I fly to and Jason Miller's dead I know that he played he was good

[00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:49.260]
I think I'm losing my faith remember that scene and they were playing that one big man by the almond brothers in the background in the bar remember that what's a priest doing in a bar I wonder who was a bar probably

[00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:56.680]
Anyway the bad news was over the weekend when I wasn't there and I wasn't playing in that particular five dollar machine for the first time in a world buying history

[00:35:56.680 --> 00:36:03.840]
I think they've been open about five six years they paid off the five dollar wheel of fortune progressive jackpot 366 grand

[00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:09.420]
Can you imagine I mean I'm not that I mean obviously they got those

[00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:19.480]
The ones where they pay millions you know the progressive ones where you got a trineman's chance to hell I played a lot of but 366 grand a band it's kind of grand if you ask me anyway getting back to the pope and the church and all their

[00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:30.460]
Forbidden the hostile attitudes about you're gonna burn in hell because you're evil and crap in Mexico city where a portion was legalized during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy church officials I just read that it's nothing new

[00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:37.320]
It's normal it wasn't arbitrary. It's what's foreseen by the church's doctrine the purple reporters of a board a plane to Brazil on the plane

[00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:46.500]
He was saying he said the main in plane falls mainly in the spain for some crap like that what is he know he's a trineman I do like the Germans but the ones under 100 years old what sleeves him out

[00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:55.540]
See that probably I see people have preconceived notions and if you never go anywhere you assume that oh the Germans are all a bunch of Nazis you know all the

[00:36:55.540 --> 00:37:02.120]
S other crap in the French they know they're perfume in their etiquette the French stink like hell and you know maybe it's against a lot of their for them to use like the

[00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:09.780]
Odomen or little you know little aftershave something maybe that's called ordinance man to these stink in order to Germans mean while

[00:37:09.780 --> 00:37:16.660]
The most wow and I'll say it again. I've said it before just for you people may be traveling this summer Berlin and

[00:37:16.660 --> 00:37:22.700]
Cologne Germany are two of the most upscale beautiful cities. I have ever seen in my life the people are beautiful the buildings are

[00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:26.920]
Beautiful and of course new and modern most of it because we bond the crap out of them at the end of W.W.W.

[00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:29.080]
The two and so that'll teach them a lesson

[00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:35.640]
That they'll never forget but they're really something and in Berlin or so like well dressed you know a really clean cut and they smell good

[00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:39.420]
Man some smell really good especially when you get close

[00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:46.080]
Oh man are you an old pervert yes yes and why the hell not you know that's part of what we're all about

[00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:53.820]
Why the hell not why be a bull crap artist why not me I certainly would never do no hanky spanky would know hot looking a young dude no

[00:37:53.820 --> 00:38:02.820]
Unless I could 821 votes who is the most obsessed and of course that gives me back the yesterday's text messages. Oh I'm sorry. I'm not mentioning that

[00:38:03.580 --> 00:38:06.360]
You know something I have no I have no qualms about

[00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:11.860]
Spilling my guts about that incident yesterday which I'm not gonna tell on the year because there's no delicate way

[00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:14.800]
I could say it I don't think no I can't imagine no

[00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:20.920]
But it's just you know if you're gonna do something that outrageous and that grotesque I mean you're gonna have to expect that people are gonna like

[00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:37.980]
Tell everybody they can find I'm gonna tell strangers it would find about it today excellent I'll tell a few people to I mean you know I'm 150 years old and I've had some strange experiences my lifetime but you got to admit that that sure makes the top 10 it is a Mondo

[00:38:37.980 --> 00:38:45.120]
Bizarro yes who is the most obsessed 821 votes on our pool and we got only 37 minutes so we won't get a thousand

[00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:55.520]
A while we're here but man we'll get to I don't know maybe 900 no you think yes Chris yes you're gonna see when the blood sugar starts getting to your head of the

[00:38:55.520 --> 00:39:00.120]
Point where you can't like even move your head to get close to the mic and speak then you know you got problems although who might

[00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:06.540]
It's okay that was such an outrageous lunch I had yesterday although the rest of the day I pretty much laid out on the food on the food category

[00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:14.300]
Most obsessed Cuban Americans with an El Castro 407 New Yorkers anything with anything New York 149

[00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:19.760]
If it's from New York it must be better it must be louder it must be more obnoxious yeah when we agree with the last two parts

[00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:32.880]
Jews about Israel 140 obsessed obsessed I'm gonna go to Israel I'm gonna go to the Caboots and then I'm coming back I'm gonna kosher the house and kill a few Arabs for Abraham Abraham Solomon that is my grandpa

[00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:46.880]
Not a wonderful name Abraham Solomon it is good Solomon's a good like that of course I would change it to you to leverage or is it the other way around now actually the name was you to leverage and they changed it to Solomon they didn't want to be conspicuous nobody

[00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:59.480]
Believes that story but it's true town stupid but it's true Lou Dobbs about illegal immigration only 45 he is he's not just obsessed he is smitten in fact I wouldn't be surprised if he'd like to kill a few illegal aliens for Jesus

[00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:16.000]
Neoroges about Brady Quinn all the way up to 31 from nowhere up to a very fine I'm gonna pass Lou Dobbs like he's laying out at the border Richard Mellon's escape obsessed with a Clintons 25 gay men obsessed with Judy Garland 15 I don't know I don't know any gay men who are obsessed with Judy Garland

[00:40:16.780 --> 00:40:24.160]

[00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:04.820]
unconfort me for said two masked men were seen entering the building who is that masked man it's the

officers from various law enforcement agencies could be seen outside Boulder high school and the

[00:46:22.860 --> 00:46:26.400]
inferences to the parking lot of the building were blocked off Boulder police spokeswoman Julie

[00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:29.980]
Brooks confirmed the school was locked down the authorities were on the scene but that's all she

[00:46:29.980 --> 00:46:34.440]
would say she would not confirm report by KOA radio that a high school staff member it's

[00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:38.020]
seen masked men entering the building messages left with the principal the school district not

they was delayed until least mid-morning well I thought they just said before a while who knows

[00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:50.460]
what's the time on this I think the class of encancers they take a no chance and I thought they

[00:46:50.460 --> 00:46:54.920]
should do take no chances and find those masked men in but a baby Florida brains all over the

[00:46:54.920 --> 00:47:02.100]

[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:13.380]
lives in parado said at trial prosecutor Dennis Seagal sounds Jewish to me also portray the former

[00:52:13.380 --> 00:52:17.500]
substitute teacher Winston Park Elementary and Rines Creek Middle schools as a manipulative man

[00:52:17.500 --> 00:52:21.720]
who maneuvered his way to the victim's household and showered the boy with gifts as a rose to feed his

[00:52:21.720 --> 00:52:27.140]
obsessive sexual interest he's showered with him or something like that Allen unknown to jurors

[00:52:27.140 --> 00:52:30.680]
flipped a suicide note into his attorney's briefcase during closing arguments and left the

[00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:35.160]
courthouse during deliberations prompting a countywide search police found Allen the next day badly

beaten in his van in a parking lot less than six blocks from the courthouse the victim's mother

[00:52:40.260 --> 00:52:44.200]
yesterday urged the judge to put Allen behind bars for the longest duration possible so we'd no

[00:52:44.200 --> 00:52:48.780]
longer be allowed to pursue his insatiable desire and lust for very young boys she said the

[00:52:48.780 --> 00:52:53.480]
sadistic demanded twisted ungodly acts he committed upon his son from july two thousand three to

[00:52:53.480 --> 00:52:57.500]
february two thousand four destroyer family and marriage and cut a measurable stress pain hurt

[00:52:57.500 --> 00:53:01.980]
in anguish Allen see the jurors box by documents in his lap of the bandage tandover's mouth

[00:53:01.980 --> 00:53:08.460]
seeming unaware of her words maybe he was making sounds with his mouth probably got practice I guess

[00:53:08.460 --> 00:53:12.060]
Allen later told the judge it spent many rewarding years as a substitute teacher and

[00:53:12.060 --> 00:53:16.180]
positively impacting children's lives he didn't acknowledge the sex frame he's behaving

[00:53:16.180 --> 00:53:20.400]
with a little bit of an effort initially to help a troubled kid I totally lost my perspective

[00:53:20.400 --> 00:53:25.300]
and I failed to realize I had crossed the line when I interceded between a mother and child for that

[00:53:25.300 --> 00:53:33.100]
I am sorry well that 40 cents about a third of a cup of really cheap watery coffee at coffee time

[00:53:33.100 --> 00:53:41.180]
not at Starbucks you couldn't even get in the door for 40 cents 892 votes more we're going to

[00:53:41.180 --> 00:53:45.600]
sounds like a fantastic deal with me in fact I think I'm going to do that contract extension

[00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:50.920]
starting now with the revision of my schedule doing 10 to 11 thirty two three days a week sounds

[00:53:50.920 --> 00:53:55.340]
great and continuing two days and thursdays in the summertime two day and thursdays only of course

[00:53:55.340 --> 00:53:59.600]
and then we can have a lot of sports stuff between 11 thirty and the two sure get those numbers

[00:53:59.600 --> 00:54:09.240]
way back tapes sports tapes and games would be good oh games that your buddy did remember

[00:54:09.720 --> 00:54:13.120]

[00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:17.880]

[00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:44.280]
a ballgame in a non sports town in the first place at 12 noon in soft lords probably it's got to

[00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:48.200]
be a travel day for the dodges I would assume maybe they're going back out west it's a you know

[00:54:48.200 --> 00:54:52.080]
