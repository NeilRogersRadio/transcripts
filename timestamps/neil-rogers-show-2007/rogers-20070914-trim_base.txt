Are you know what the hell is going on

[00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.180]
If I put up any hire

[00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.500]
I will push off the board

[00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.600]
That was their level

[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.540]
It's all very loud

[00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:31.600]
It's Friday

[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.860]
You're fast

[00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.660]
You're marveled at dancing with a star

[00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.780]
You loved skating with a star

I can't reach

Joey, your other left hand

Your favorite flexible celebrities

All tangled up in one crazy competition

Heather Mills

[00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.000]
Left leg on yellow

[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.980]
Oh yes, I think I can

[00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.340]
Yes, yes, there it is

[00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.040]
Hey wait, no fair, she's using her stop

[00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.100]
Just when you thought we went out of stupid celebrity reality competitions

[00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.460]
We'd drag out the plastic mat and cardboard spinner board

[00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.060]
Twister with a star

John O'Hirley

[00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.440]
Looks like the right leg on green was you're undoing

[00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.620]
Ah yes, unfortunately I now have a severe grind for

[00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:33.860]
But to be all tossing up with one Paulina Poroskaba was well worth it didn't do

[00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.100]
Don't miss them, not enough nuttiness

[00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.620]
Till night on Twister with a star

[00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.920]
Well, the vendors they got that in their job

[00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.160]
Okay, they killed them, they murdered them

[00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.920]
Yep, destroyed them and the slime ball, scum bucket

[00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:46.840]
Why wouldn't call them murder?

[00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.960]
Well, he'd like to be

[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.920]
At any rate, that's the big story

[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.620]
Although I'm sure Chris wants to hear about the Patriots getting fined because you're jealous

[00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.680]
You know, the same jealousy of the dolphin parents

[00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:01.580]
You bet, right? I'm officially

[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.160]
New England Patriots were fined $250,000 and could have to give up a first round draft choice

[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.720]
After NFL Commissioner Roger Videll decided to the team broke NFL rules

[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.440]
Even though everybody does it

[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.160]
By video taping an opponent on the field during last week's game against the New York Jets

[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.780]
Even though every other team in the league does it and they admit it and never less

[00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.220]
Patriots coach Bill Bollochek was personally fined $500,000 as well

[00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:26.640]
Half a million bucks Chris

[00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:28.940]
Not to help them out

[00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.900]
No, I think you should set it all to me

[00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.340]
The Patriots were caught having a video assistant taping the defensive signals of New York Jets

[00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.840]
While on the field of play, direct violation of NFL rules

[00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.060]
The tape was confiscated and sent to the NFL

[00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.880]
But the league rule that because the tape was seized in the first quarter

[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.820]
It had no bearing on the outcome of the game

[00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.980]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha, alright

[00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.160]
No kidding

[00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.160]
Oh brother, that said, Kudell came down hard on the Patriots and continues his stance

[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.700]
Of punishing harshly those who break the rules set forth by the league

[00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.640]
While his come down hard on players like Pac-Man Jones and Michael Vick

[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.280]
Pac-Man Jones, is he kind of Coco Crisp?

[00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.420]
Yeah

[00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.420]
But Elis also now shown to crack down on organizations and even coaches who break the rules

[00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.840]
Bill Bollochek opposes us for what he termed the embarrassment, distraction and penalty his mistake caused

[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.640]
Although it again, Billy Boy, don't do it again because then Chris will be saying,

[00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.580]
Raaah, I think she, they cheat, nah

[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.640]
Exactly, that's what you'll be saying because you're a crybaby

[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.500]
And if you're going to be a dolphin, you have to be a crybaby

[00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.660]
Here's the schedule for today speaking of dolphins

[00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.000]
We got that all asses in there but only at 7 o'clock tonight

[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.340]
We got Mad Dog at 2, the power hour with Mad Dog and Henry Goldberg at 4 o'clock

[00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.080]
Hank, all by himself, 5 to 7

[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:45.280]
Miami dolphins all access, this is our dolphins infomercial between 7 and 8 35 followed by the Marlins game

[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.860]
Any interest?

[00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:46.120]
No

[00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.580]
A little teeny tiny interest?

[00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.800]
No

[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:48.880]
For 10 for us

[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:57.080]
A dolphin pregame shows, I mean the Marlins, 8 35, 905, the Marlins have Colorado to play their Rockies in a very pivotal game

[00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.840]
Not

[00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:59.700]
Here's the pull result from yesterday

[00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.720]
And don't forget if my phone rings I'm moving up and running the other room

[00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:05.520]
I'll cue something up

[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.140]
Yeah

[00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:07.680]
Oh, I'll just spin some wax

[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:08.280]
That's what I mean

[00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.860]
Oh, I see, screw something up

[00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:11.480]
Wouldn't be the first time

[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:18.340]
1226 votes on the pull yesterday and I just go and brand it all by the way Charlie B is back for those people interested in the polls

[00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:19.280]
Which there aren't too many

[00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:25.220]
And Charlie sends me an emotional email this morning about he was on a three week vacation

[00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:30.500]
And Yadi, Yadi, Yadi, Yadi and how he got such a big kick out of us yesterday wondering where the hell is Charlie B

[00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:31.180]
Where all the polls?

[00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.540]
And then he starts out by sending a couple of really crappy polls

[00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:40.100]
I realize you're out of practice Charlie, but the stuff you send in I wouldn't wish it on Paul and Ron

[00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:41.900]
You know that's what you send in

[00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:44.720]
Brandon is taking your role

[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:50.180]
You know, first it was Sean against Charlie B and that's Brandon against Charlie B and Brandon sent me a couple of decent ones

[00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:52.000]
And this was his

[00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.720]
What is the most emasculating thing for a guy?

[00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.980]
1226 votes

[00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:59.520]

Being impotent 176

[00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.520]
You know this the first two both have to do with your penis

[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:09.920]
What?

[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.080]
Having Neil Rogers kick your ass 151

[00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.480]
I said penis I don't want to say it again because Joyce will get all upset

[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.220]
Joyce just got a problem

[00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:20.960]
I remember the day that Clarence came in was a Clarence or Duff

[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.560]
No it was Clarence because Duff wasn't PD back in the Joyce date

[00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:26.680]
And he said Joyce has a problem with penis

[00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.020]
That was the line too

[00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:30.840]
That was exactly what he said

[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:31.940]
That's what I don't know that

[00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.920]
Most emasculating thing for a guy having Neil Rogers kick your ass 151

[00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:38.940]
Being raped by a guy 122

[00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.640]
Carrying your wife or girlfriend's purse 106

[00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:42.460]
How sweet

[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.960]
Having your girl kick your ass 104

[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:48.240]
Buying tampon 77 with George is admitted to doing

[00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:49.260]
Sure

[00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:52.260]
Why not having a gay guy kick your ass 37

[00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:53.960]
Being raped by a girl 35

[00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:57.100]
Spending a day alone with your mother-in-law 29

Being seen crying 20 and being sterile got only five

[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:03.780]
I mean that's yeah we can't blame you for that

[00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:06.420]
It's an act of nature it's an act of a guy

[00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:07.240]
I feel good

[00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.280]
That's what it is

[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.180]
585 vote on today's pool

[00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:13.860]
Well this isn't a pool it's the survey

[00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:15.520]
And you know something that's pretty weak

[00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:18.600]
Although it did go up there late my fault it's my bad

[00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:22.500]
I was busy yesterday I was involved in buying a car

[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.040]
Thank you

[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.240]
Not for you

[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:28.380]
Yeah if I was buying a car for Chris

[00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:31.020]
Go to one

[00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:31.500]
Yeah

[00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:36.720]
587 tally so far which is very very embarrassingly weak

[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:40.960]
Ethnic survey which of these are you I know we did the demographic one

[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:42.440]
Early in the week and that's what they're going to say

[00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:46.360]
You're sending it in you're mailing it in the it's another one of those ethnic polls

[00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:47.340]
Yeah right

[00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:48.180]
Whatever

[00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:50.720]
It's kind of interesting even George said it was interesting

[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.160]
He usually hates the polls so

[00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:55.720]
No I just hate coming up with them and carrying them up

[00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:58.900]
Ethnic survey which are you Anglo male non-Hispanic of course

[00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:01.640]
409 almost 70%

[00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:05.780]
And of course even if you're like Jewish that makes you an angler in the South Florida

[00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:07.520]
Which I always find most amusing

[00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:10.080]
Hispanic male 72

[00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:12.900]
That's not so bad 12.2%

[00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:13.900]
Right

[00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:16.460]
Because we know there's a lot more who won't admit it

[00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:19.440]
Subhuman 42 now George asked me this morning before the show

[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:20.420]
Why did you put that on there?

[00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:20.860]
Right human

[00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:23.900]
In other words you just gave something for the smartasses to vote

[00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:24.200]
Right

[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:27.460]
I would have to give the smartasses nothing to vote for

[00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:30.860]
Until I'm Haba Bama and Dread like you say

[00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:32.140]

[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:53.200]
Engines Native Americans

Now let me ask you something do Native Americans

[00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:57.940]
I guess it depends on the person but

[00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:00.380]
Do they are resenting called engines?

[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:03.980]
I guess you'd yeah it depends on the person you got to act something

[00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:04.820]
Only if you're a

[00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:06.860]
And they resented a lot

[00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:13.020]
Anyway Native American male 3 Black female 3 Asian female 1 Asian male 1

[00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:14.520]
And Native American female none

[00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:16.100]
No papoos

[00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:18.460]
No papoos is the little baby on the back right?

[00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:19.260]
Right

[00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:20.720]
Over that we just got one

[00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:23.760]
We just got a Native American female 1

[00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:25.120]
Just came in 599

[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:27.620]
Hey we got a wall we should have put that on there

[00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:28.280]
They love that

[00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:35.840]
So there's the survey we're taking the course with only 595 on there

[00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:38.740]
That indicates things are really rough

[00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:39.840]
Rough red and sore

[00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:43.940]
So here's the big story that they were hyperventilating about all day yesterday

[00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:46.240]
Just filming at the mouth and rightfully so I guess

[00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:48.980]
The man suspected of killing one day

[00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:52.560]
Cop and wounding three others in the shootout yesterday morning was cornered and shot dead

[00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:56.260]
In a Pembroke Pines condo complex sometime before midnight

[00:08:57.020 --> 00:09:01.420]
Dave Mayor Carlos Alvarez and police director Robert Parker speaking at a news conference

[00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:06.940]
Told reporters police had shot Sean Sherwin-Labit at Heron Pond condos

[00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:08.580]
305 Southwest 85th Avenue

[00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:10.900]
He was armed with a loaded weapon

[00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:14.340]
And had additional ammunition said Parker was said to be was wearing body armor

[00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:19.060]
He had the mindset of surviving your confrontation with law enforcement Parker added

[00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:21.040]
Police learned if the beats were about to lay through

[00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:24.160]
It's interesting that yesterday they had the wrong guy's name and the wrong picture

[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:25.420]
Because of the wallet that was left

[00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:29.160]
You know when they're kind of interesting and they showed the wrong picture of the wrong guy

[00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:30.340]
Yeah, we're looking for you all

[00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:32.800]
I did not know that even though he's some guy in Jacksonville

[00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:35.680]
Police learned if the beats were about to lay through

[00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:38.540]
They sent a special team of heavily armed officers to the condo complex

[00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:43.740]
When the team of officers arrived they spotted chased and curried a beat by the apartment complex pool

[00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:50.140]
The deadly drama that took place at the apartment complex brought to an end an exhausting emotional day for police and the public

[00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:53.580]
That began early yesterday with the routine burglary detailing South-aid

[00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:55.680]
What happened next was anything but routine

[00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:59.180]
One day the officer was shot dead three wounded a massive man hundred cross-off

[00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:02.660]
Throwed a dangerous killer on the run for hours caught and shot Dave

[00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:07.020]
This is a very sad day for us Alvarez said during an emotional press conference

[00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:11.440]
Some crucial details were made unclear but based on interviews and preliminary forensic analysis

[00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:14.600]
Several enforcement officials gave this account of the beats actions

[00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:19.300]
Two officers spotted the suspect driving alone in an old Honda Accord near a housing development

[00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:22.120]
It self-washed 280th street and 143rd court

[00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:24.700]
The officers tried to stop the beat but he took off

[00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:27.920]
Far from the man who did his girlfriend's house the officers called for backup

[00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:32.180]
The girlfriend who was not identified showed up to the same time as police and the beat

[00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:37.820]
From inside the house police say the baby opened far through a window with an assault rifle possibly an 8K-47

[00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:41.720]
Strecking some a honor 37 delivered in date and in the neck and kill him

[00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:46.820]
LeBeth and ran out of the house to take this brief shot some honor again before bolting for his car firing wildly

[00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:50.980]
The other officers now arriving at the scene the man didn't hesitate to shoot Alvarez said

[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:55.140]
Officer Jodie Wright 31 was shot in the leg her knee shattered

[00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:57.480]
She shouted into her radio officers were downed and helped

[00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:02.440]
Bullets graze the other two officers Carlton 34 and Tomas tuned into her 37

[00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:05.920]
Police say LeBeth sped away with the officers in pursuit

[00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:10.900]
He cranked into a fence along the Black Creek Canal at Southwest 129th Avenue 203rd street jumped out of the car

[00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:13.820]
Apparently ditching his weapon which police recovered and disappeared on foot

[00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:18.320]
Afraid to leave some a honor officers picked him up and drove him out of the development of the squad car

[00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:20.060]
Paramedics pronounced the officer dead

[00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:25.160]
A team was across his street from where at least one of the officers was shot gave the hero of an account of the incident

[00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:30.400]
That missions with initial police conclusions the 15-year-old said she had run outside after a grandmother said

[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:34.580]
Police were pointing her gun at a woman she said she saw a car out from her the driver's side to open

[00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:37.120]
A woman was in the passenger seat and two children in the back

[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:41.100]
She said the woman got out grabbed the children ran into the house just before the shooting started

[00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:44.540]
I heard somebody say daddy know like a little girl. That's when they started shooting

[00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:47.920]
The shooting came from inside the house across the street

[00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:51.660]
She said as soon as she heard the shots she ran inside her own house and watched from the front window

[00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:58.100]
I saw the police officer lying on the ground she said I think he shot out the window because there were holes in the window where the officer was laying

[00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:02.860]
Within minutes police began swarming the scene in the surrounding neighborhood and searching one house

[00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:05.360]
They stumbled upon an indoor marijuana farm

[00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:06.800]
Oh my god

[00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:07.400]
Wow

[00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:09.840]
Good thing you weren't down there

[00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:10.880]
Right?

[00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:12.340]
Doing a little business

[00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:19.800]
Streets and local highway exits were closed to seal off escape routes causing nightmarish traffic backups and keeping residents from their homes into the night

[00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:21.500]
Cars were stopped trunk search

[00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:26.560]
The search later extended to Broward County who were police believed the suspect whose mother lives in Margate might head

[00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:31.600]
Police erected then dismantled a cordon around that neighborhood but remained stationed outside the house end of the night

[00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:34.160]
For hours police misidentified the suspect

[00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:37.900]
The first bullet and they should shortly before noon describe the heavy-set white male

[00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:42.760]
Soon afterward police received an auto tag the belonging man who they mistakenly believed owned the Honda

[00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:45.800]
Driven by the shooter then they released another aeronious identification

[00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:48.060]
Kevin Wainer 30 this time with a photograph

[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:52.680]
Wow at about four p.m. police identified a labi 25 is the correct suspect

[00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:57.800]
They said a second photograph had released earlier identified as Wainers was in fact labi

[00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:03.340]
And that's what he's feeling right now kind of labi as in dead

[00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:10.080]
So there you go another nightmarish and crazy people with guns especially with assault weapons which the Republicans love

[00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:16.520]
They just can't get enough AK-47s and all kinds of wild weapons to suit the right way the gun nuts the NRA

[00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:23.440]
Remember what the NRA were saying they said well one boy's gets in we're gonna have our own that's right next to the in the oral off

[00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:27.740]
Remember that that's what they were saying and they had a good point

[00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:29.100]
What biggest name?

[00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:30.060]
Longest talent

[00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:33.780]
You know there's no projects 4.560 QAM

[00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:35.580]
The sports leader

[00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:36.740]
Go Rogers God

[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:47.460]
Newbie Brand new game all the kids are learning to play now

[00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:53.440]
In every big city across the US of the now

[00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:59.600]
So keep yourself some hardware and both the other fellow away now

[00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:05.100]
They've all got guns guns guns up there on the streets to pay

[00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:08.140]
They've got guns up there on the streets to pay

[00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:11.800]
They've got a music sheet brought it into show in town now

[00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:13.700]
So in town

[00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:17.800]
Billy Brothers love you and pretty expensive to sell now

[00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:19.700]
So now it's much of a sell

[00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:24.480]
They can bear as a feature angel in them out before the bell bell

[00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:29.760]
Now they've got guns guns guns out there on the streets to pay

[00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:33.080]
They've got guns up there on the streets to pay

[00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:43.280]
The one boy from the girls you've been made like you've dreamed for a night now

[00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:44.700]
Dream for a night

[00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:48.800]
Either first you on your block, then think how it's coming carry away now

[00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:50.560]
And now they carry away

[00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:55.180]
So what if Johnny can't read he can still join the NRA night

[00:14:55.980 --> 00:15:00.120]
Don't hit that gun, gun, gun, gun, pick it all for each other

[00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:06.900]
Waitations, please, and you have all got guns guns guns up there on the streets to pay

[00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:14.800]
They've got a music sheet brought it into show in town now

[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:18.520]
So what if Johnny can't read he can still join the NRA night

[00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:20.540]
Don't hit that gun, gun, gun, gun, gun, gun, pick it all for each other

[00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:24.000]
But during the course of history of human events

[00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:27.520]
The fact that anybody ever invented guns in the first place

[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:30.560]
Should be a pretty good commentary on the human race, shouldn't it?

[00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:33.440]
I mean, that's a little bit too deep and too philosophical, isn't it?

[00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:34.760]
Yeah, it's actually on the Friday

[00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:37.360]
They invented the pointy stick so you know

[00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:40.600]
Pointy stick was a good start and they should just stuck it, you know what I'm saying?

[00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:41.700]
But don't continue where?

[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.180]
His jokes will get very upset

[00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:49.360]
Six hundred twenty nine people of a tallied and unmarried were at least we got somebody in every category but not all that many

[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:50.760]
Pretty weak

[00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:53.320]
I remember once upon a time when we had an audience

[00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:56.260]
Remember those days boy, it was sure there was a lot of time ago but still I remember

[00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:58.100]
Yeah, well they don't seem to care about that

[00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:01.300]
We're not into audience, we're not into promotion, we're not into like a radio, we start

[00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:03.980]
We're into ratings, no God forbid, we're into spots

[00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:06.100]
Spots, we lot, spots

[00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:08.600]
Oh yeah, if you've got some money, so we'll do you spot

[00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:13.120]
Former Republican Congressman Mark Foley, gay

[00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:17.080]
Who's emails and instant messages caused an uproar and became the butt?

[00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:22.020]
Blackdum of a thousand jokes might have scored yet again, says ha ha ha ha

[00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:25.340]
Boy, who wrote this, on the raw story?

[00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:26.280]
Well, he's pretty raw

[00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:32.220]
According to ABC, Florida laws may spare the congressman because of the state's three-year statute limitations

[00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:36.920]
Florida did not start a criminal investigation of Foley until November 2006

[00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:41.320]
Making it nearly impossible to prosecute an explicit instant message fully sent away

[00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:44.960]
17-year-old high school student in 2003. Who's to blame?

[00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:49.880]
House leadership for one who had knowledge of folies in appropriate behavior for years.

[00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:54.900]
The emails originally leaked out of the Office of Representative Rodney Alexander, Republican

[00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:58.320]
Illusion, a Democrat-comer-publican who changed parties in 2004.

[00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:02.140]
But the untold story is that the media too had a hand in protecting folie.

[00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:05.500]
They had a hand in it. I can't tell you where, but...

[00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:08.760]
Backdome seems to be really busy. I don't like the guy that he was called with all the stuff.

[00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:13.940]
Remember every day? I have two parakeets and 16 gidgings in my ass.

[00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:14.840]
Remember that guy? Yeah.

[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.040]
The messages first crossed the desk of the St. Pete Times in 2005,

[00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:25.360]
raw stories also were through various sources that ABC had elements of the folies

[00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:28.000]
story a year prior to the article's release.

[00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:33.480]
The critical instant message conversation cited by a law enforcement, however,

[00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:36.020]
didn't emerge until after ABC published their story.

[00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:40.920]
In August 2006, Harper's Magazine also admitted they received the first batch of

[00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:44.320]
over-friendly emails a month earlier. Overly, friendly. Right.

[00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:49.260]
St. Pete is the Bertam executive editor near Brown. Defendant is decision not to run the

[00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:53.180]
folie story. After they received creepy messages from a Louisiana page in which

[00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:54.400]
folie was seeking to photograph.

[00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:59.240]
I led deliberations with our top editors. We concluded we didn't have enough

[00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:03.160]
substantiated information to reach beyond Inuendo Brown wrote in an October 2,

[00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:07.380]
2006 editorial. We couldn't come up with a strong enough case to explain to a teenager's

[00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:11.420]
parents why over their vehement plans to please to drop the matter, we needed to make

[00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:15.040]
their son the subject of the story and the incredible scrutiny that would sure follow.

[00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:19.460]
It ended up to this conclusion, Brown. I did the print what we had seemed to be a shortcut

[00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:22.360]
to taint a member of Congress that went on actually having the goods.

[00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:24.940]
Oh my god. Can I read that last sentence again?

[00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:31.000]
Talk about quadruple in you window. To print what we had seemed to be a shortcut to taint

[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.480]
a member of Congress without actually having the goods.

[00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:39.480]
Wow. Lane Hudson, the former human rights campaign staffer who first posed the emails online,

[00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:42.760]
they posting what's for a ABC and a running of story, said he wasn't surprised.

[00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:46.760]
The fact that folie is getting away with it is symptomatic of how things work in

[00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:51.200]
Washington Hudson said Republicans in Congress knew about it for years and did nothing about it.

[00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:56.120]
The FBI did nothing about it and the media failed its responsibility to properly investigate it.

[00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:58.500]
By the way, my phone is not going to ring.

[00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:00.700]
They're already rang and she left me a message.

[00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:01.740]
All right nice. Yep.

[00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:04.120]
My friend from State Farm. I love State Farm by the way.

[00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:07.440]
Can I say that? I don't know if they advertise on the station but I do like that a lot.

[00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:09.780]
Well what? I said I don't know if they have.

[00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:10.720]
Well I just did say that.

[00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:11.100]
All right.

[00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:14.420]
For the first time, Brown, well maybe they'll give me a better deal now.

[00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:17.720]
For the first time, Ross Story will also have been having had the email exchange

[00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:20.840]
between folie and a mail page prior to ABC's publication.

[00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:25.080]
This site didn't receive the emails until roughly a week prior to ABC's release and was

[00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:27.760]
unable to acquire a second source to publish the story.

[00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:29.820]
We didn't have the more explicit I.M.

[00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:32.180]
conversations and now folie probably will get away.

[00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:38.020]
Barring any extraordinary circumstances, it's very unlikely for charges to be filed in a case

[00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:40.440]
once the statute limitations has run its course.

[00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:41.100]
I.A. Groober.

[00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:43.560]
Or is that grubber as in grubber Tuchas?

[00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:48.160]
I.A. Groober a former federal public defender and professor of law at F.I.U.

[00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:49.040]
told ABC News.

[00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:51.080]
I shouldn't have said grubber Tuchas.

[00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:52.200]
That's bad. That's fat ass.

[00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:57.100]
Federal officials turned the case over to Florida after concluding that folie did not engage in

[00:19:57.100 --> 00:20:02.400]
any actual sexual conduct until the former pages had turned 18 and therefore not violated federal law.

[00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:06.220]
Washington, EC Law defines the age of consent as 16.

[00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:09.100]
How do you like that?

[00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:12.980]
Florida Law stipulates that using the Internet to seduce solicit,

[00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:17.400]
Laura were entice a minor to commit any illegal act relating to lootless or indecent exposure

[00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:22.120]
as a third degree felony, this would include email and instant messages, instant massages.

[00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:27.140]
Mike Rogers, the gay blogger who first suggested folie was gay on his website blog active,

[00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:28.340]
also said the media had failed.

[00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:31.700]
Mike Rogers is the same guy that was outing Larry Craig long time ago.

[00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:33.640]
You know the toe tap and Larry?

[00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:39.480]
Once again, the mainstream media spailed in its role in a great democracy, said Mike Rogers,

[00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:42.960]
despite even being constitutional protectors to produce pursued stories,

[00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:45.840]
the papers in Florida not only protected a political career,

[00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:49.020]
most likely so they could have continued access to congressman folie,

[00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:51.060]
but they stood in the way of reporting a crime.

[00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:55.060]
With a statute of limitations passed, the blame for markfulties escaped from the law,

[00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:58.700]
squarely falls on the heads of the newspapers that had this evidence.

[00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:02.420]
The House, led by Democrats, has also stomped Florida's investigation,

[00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:06.000]
lawyers for the Chamber of Blocked Investigators access to folies computers,

[00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:09.540]
saying they were the equivalent of congressional papers which only folie could release.

[00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:13.840]
The action followed on the heels of what was later ruled an unconstitutional invasion

[00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:16.980]
and representative William Jefferson's House office in a robbery inquiry.

[00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:19.700]
That's representative Jefferson L.

[00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:22.460]
I called cash in the freezer.

[00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:25.560]
ABC was the first report that I'll tell you what,

[00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:28.920]
if you keep your cash cash in the freezer, it's unlikely to get stolen.

[00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:30.240]
Wouldn't you think?

[00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:31.680]
I imagine that's a good one.

[00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:34.140]
ABC was the first report the action by the House's lawyers,

[00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:36.300]
folie resigned hours after more troubling messages,

[00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:41.240]
but former congressional pages became public by ABC on September 29, 2006,

[00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:43.960]
proving beyond a shadow of a doubt not only was he gay,

[00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:46.760]
but he was also a pedophile or trying to be anyway.

[00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:49.100]
Well, he was grooming them until they became legal agent.

[00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:51.180]
Oh, let's have a birthday party, and I like that.

[00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:54.140]
According to media bistro, ABC news,

[00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:57.020]
and maybe I could cater the birthday party.

[00:21:57.940 --> 00:21:59.260]
I could pay for it anyway.

[00:21:59.460 --> 00:21:59.640]
All right.

[00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:02.400]
According to media bistro, ABC news, the blotter,

[00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:04.760]
which sparked the investigation that exposed luteants to the message

[00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:06.140]
sent by Republican congressman,

[00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:07.660]
remarked folie to a congressional page,

[00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:08.820]
and rocked Congress.

[00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:13.460]
While the 2007 National Headliner Award for Television Affiliated Online Journalism

[00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:16.140]
forwards reporting on the scandal, how do you like that?

[00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:18.460]
ABC news, the blotter,

[00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:21.120]
well, there you go.

[00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:21.920]
It's all old stuff.

[00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:23.240]
Nobody in his fault potatoes now.

[00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:25.480]
Now that we got Larry Craig to kick around,

[00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:31.120]
648 people have touted in there on our survey.

[00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:34.780]
Ethnic survey, which are you anglo-male non-Hispanic,

[00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:39.340]
443, 68.3% Hispanic male 81, 12.5%.

[00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:40.100]
That's not bad.

[00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:42.460]
Whatever that means.

[00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:44.340]
I mean, that's everybody under what?

[00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:46.060]
50 words to cut off when they don't.

[00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:47.160]
I haven't done it.

[00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:48.980]
I didn't do the thing with the ages on this one.

[00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:49.740]
We already did that.

[00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:51.000]
I don't want it all to get missing.

[00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:52.020]
I'm so depressing.

[00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:54.240]
Plus, we can do that one next week.

[00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:55.800]
Who wants those old listeners anyway?

[00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:56.520]
Whatever they are.

[00:22:56.820 --> 00:22:57.080]
We knew.

[00:22:57.260 --> 00:23:00.360]
Some human 47 will take anybody if they're breathing or close to it,

[00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:01.600]
if they're still like a little warm.

[00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:04.720]
Anglo-female 43, 6.5%.

[00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:07.280]
Black male 20, Native American male 6.

[00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:09.860]
Hispanic female 4, we're up to 4, George.

[00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:13.960]
Black female 3, Native American female 1.

[00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:15.000]
Asian female 1.

[00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:16.120]
Asian male 1.

[00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:16.900]
Salamente Uno.

[00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:21.800]
Black male 20, Native American male 4.

[00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:23.680]
25, 60, QAM.

[00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:25.460]
The sports leader.

[00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:26.900]
Yankee, baby.

[00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:32.020]
Yankee, got straight back.

[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:34.180]
Holy the whole boy.

[00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:34.720]
Hey.

[00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:40.760]
We're not the panoramic of our list, Quibble.

[00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:47.960]
Make no need for a hat to lose eye again.

[00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:54.620]
What a world of the world of the fish you run.

[00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:56.800]
Big and big, big, big, big hot pot.

[00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:57.340]
And yeah.

[00:23:58.800 --> 00:23:59.180]
Yeah.

[00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:00.280]
Yeah.

[00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:00.280]

[00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:00.720]
Oh, yeah.

[00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:02.280]
Yeah.

[00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:04.380]
That's the vacation school.

[00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:05.780]
Holy the whole day.

[00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:06.320]
Oh.

[00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:07.540]
Holy the whole day.

[00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:09.200]
Oh, I'm sure the whole day.

[00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:11.100]
Holy the whole day.

[00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:11.840]
I'm pretty much.

[00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:13.840]
I'm looking for a way to make it.

[00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:17.440]
I'm looking for a way to make it.

[00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:17.800]
I'm looking for a way to make it.

[00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:18.260]
Oh, yeah.

[00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:21.120]
Yeah.

[00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:22.060]
Yeah.

[00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:22.540]

[00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:23.160]
Yeah.

[00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:23.240]

[00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:24.180]

[00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:25.260]
Yeah.

[00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:29.160]
Black female 1.

[00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:31.300]
Can't find her done for me.

[00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:32.420]
My phone is.

[00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:33.940]
You're fairy.

[00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:37.480]
Oh, that's a huge much fun.

[00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:39.320]
It's too much rolling.

[00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:42.860]
You're fairy.

[00:24:43.140 --> 00:24:46.720]
Is a jelly cross can't be far behind now.

[00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:52.060]
Needless to go, go, go, go.

[00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:53.760]
Round to pound, go.

[00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:56.080]
Round to pound and fly.

[00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:57.940]
Of the fly.

[00:24:58.760 --> 00:24:59.600]
Of the fly.

[00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:00.620]
Of the fly.

[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.400]
That's because of all the foolish.

[00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:04.420]
Holy the whole day.

[00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:04.960]
Oh, yeah.

[00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:06.200]
Holy the whole day.

[00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:07.260]
It's a black female.

[00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:08.860]
It's a cray.

[00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:10.560]
Holy the whole day.

[00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:12.400]
Oh, my dear.

[00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:15.200]
Holy the whole day.

[00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:16.260]
Holy the whole day.

[00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:18.660]
Round to pound and fly.

[00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:22.320]
That's because of all the fun.

[00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:22.700]
Oh, my dear.

[00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:23.660]
We are in a battle.

[00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:24.080]
We are in a battle.

[00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:25.560]
We are in a battle.

[00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:26.360]
We are in a battle.

[00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:28.120]
Oh, my dear.

[00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:28.460]
Oh.

[00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:32.440]
1033, 207, 411.

[00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:33.840]
A guest who's back in the news, George.

[00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:34.880]
Oh, Jay.

[00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:36.120]
Oh, good guess.

[00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:37.560]
Oh, it was on CNN at end.

[00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:38.700]
I know just moments ago.

[00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:43.420]
Las Vegas Metro Police confirmed early this morning

[00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:46.520]
that OJ Simpson was questioned in connection to a theft

[00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:48.500]
at the Palastation Casino.

[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:51.280]
Remember the palastation?

[00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:53.200]
No, that was the Imperial Palace, wasn't it?

[00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:53.340]
Yes.

[00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:54.400]
Oh, sorry.

[00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:54.960]
Wrong one.

[00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:55.620]
Wrong palace.

[00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:58.880]
Police spokesman Jose Montoya said Simpson

[00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:00.260]
was questioned about a hotel room

[00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:02.020]
breaking at the Casino late Thursday night.

[00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:04.240]
Montoya said the theft involved sports member

[00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:05.760]
or media but offered no further details.

[00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:06.980]
Oh, no.

[00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:09.580]
Police said Simpson has been released

[00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:11.180]
and has believed to be in Las Vegas.

[00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:14.360]
He was supposed to give a deposition in Miami today

[00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:16.560]
in a bankruptcy case involving his eldest daughter.

[00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:19.040]
It was canceled because Simpson had told attorneys

[00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:20.000]
he'd be out of town.

[00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:23.200]
A news conference will be held later this morning,

[00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:25.800]
it's a Fox five Vegas.

[00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:27.780]
How do you like that?

[00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:30.780]
He was supposed to give a deposition in Miami

[00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:31.820]
to the day but he's in Vegas.

[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.080]
I wonder what he's doing in Vegas.

[00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:33.960]
Certainly not gambling.

[00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:35.920]
I hope not with the Browns and the Simpson's money.

[00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:38.040]
An empty bag?

[00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:39.020]
That would be gold.

[00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:39.980]
What's his name?

[00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:41.440]
That would be really bad.

[00:26:41.620 --> 00:26:42.760]
Especially right after Russia's show

[00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:44.480]
it would be messing with the goldman's money in Vegas.

[00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:46.260]
Don't be plunging it away, OJ.

[00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:48.980]
Six hundred and sixty-one people

[00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:50.020]
are going to retaliate in an hour.

[00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:51.760]
I think if we don't get to a thousand of the on this,

[00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:52.800]
I mean this is just a survey.

[00:26:53.140 --> 00:26:54.300]
That means we fold up our tent

[00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:55.500]
and Georgia's going to be on our Monday.

[00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:56.180]
Remember what I told you?

[00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:56.880]
Yeah.

[00:26:57.260 --> 00:26:58.820]
But I'm picking up that new car on Monday

[00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:00.320]
and you know, you know,

[00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:01.600]
you want to spin it around town.

[00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:04.040]
Oh, I started telling you this yesterday, I think,

[00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:05.640]
and I never got back to it.

[00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:07.160]
It'll make you feel a little bit better

[00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:09.380]
about being stuck in that right hole called South Florida.

[00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:11.820]
If you think the driving there is bad,

[00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:14.040]
you ain't seen nothing yet.

[00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:14.900]
Sorry, I'll take it.

[00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:15.500]
I'll lose my goose.

[00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:15.900]
What?

[00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:16.920]
I'll take it.

[00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:18.120]
No, I'm done.

[00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:19.080]
Tanya, you're wrong.

[00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:22.780]
You assume and probably won't be so.

[00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:25.780]
I assume that there couldn't possibly be any driving worse

[00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:28.920]
than the swill that passes his driving in South Florida.

[00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:32.560]
It's a picnic compared to what's going on here.

[00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:33.940]
I'll take it.

[00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:35.640]
First of all, there's five million people here

[00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:36.460]
and there aren't enough roads.

[00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:38.020]
There's one major east-west highway

[00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:39.560]
the Garden of Expressway and that's it.

[00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:41.680]
I mean, it's just ridiculous.

[00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:46.080]
And there's all these old Chinese people

[00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:47.300]
who got the driver's license,

[00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:50.980]
I think in a box of wantons and it's just amazing.

[00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:54.420]
But nevertheless, not a good place to have a car.

[00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:59.160]
Jewish holidays have collided with youth football out west

[00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:01.280]
to Stephanie Horrath in the sunset.

[00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:02.980]
And I wonder what ever happened to old Mike Horrath.

[00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:04.160]
He used to be a channel six.

[00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:05.940]
He was a photographer.

[00:28:08.540 --> 00:28:09.380]
Remember Mike Horrath?

[00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:10.080]
Nope.

[00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:11.860]
Once upon a time, he sure looked good.

[00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:12.860]
I'll say that he was a good guy.

[00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:14.460]
Young Mike.

[00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:15.880]
Maybe that's a long time ago.

[00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:16.200]
What?

[00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:17.420]
Maybe that's why you remember him.

[00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:18.140]
And I know.

[00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:19.260]
Because you look good, that's right.

[00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:20.400]
I don't remember ugly people.

[00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:21.100]
I mean, I do.

[00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:23.080]
I remember some ugly people I'm trying to forget them though.

[00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:26.720]
And of course, that's the motto of the right winners

[00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:29.440]
is don't do who we do do what we talk about.

[00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:32.120]
Is that what it is don't do who we're in?

[00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:34.420]
The western communities football league

[00:28:34.420 --> 00:28:35.980]
which draws about a thousand kids.

[00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:37.680]
This is Wellington, by the way.

[00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:41.120]
Scheduled practices during Russia, Shawna,

[00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:43.340]
and games during Yumkipper, two of the holiest days

[00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:45.540]
in the Jewish calendar and some parents are pissed off.

[00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:45.900]
Oy!

[00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:48.080]
Well, actually, it says in the Sun Central upset,

[00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:50.440]
but I'm saying pissed off because we can still say it.

[00:28:51.340 --> 00:28:53.800]
One of the very few things we can still say as in.

[00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:56.640]
Pits off, it's neat, fired up when I hear someone say that.

[00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:57.920]
Right, well, we're pissed off.

[00:28:58.500 --> 00:28:59.600]
That you said that.

[00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:02.600]
I'm shocked at the level of intolerance I'm receiving

[00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:04.460]
from our foreign minority religion said,

[00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:06.660]
Jeremy Slesher, whose eight-year-old son,

[00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:09.120]
Jacob Rosenblum, is playing football for the first time

[00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:09.500]
this year.

[00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:11.580]
Well, guess what, Jeremy, you shouldn't be having your kid

[00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:12.580]
handling that pig skin.

[00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:13.140]
It's trache.

[00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:14.400]
It's wrong with you.

[00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:17.580]
It says my Jewish son shouldn't be afforded

[00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:20.360]
the same opportunities as a Christian child playing football.

[00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:22.000]
Give me the ball, give me the ball.

[00:29:23.540 --> 00:29:25.020]
Most Saturdays the league, along with,

[00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:26.900]
I guess it's our favorite Jewish athlete of all time,

[00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:28.940]
and we don't have to be Sandy Kofax, is that correct Chris?

[00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:34.240]
I'm not sure about Hank Greenberg and Al Rosen and Joel Horland.

[00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:35.200]
What about Jack Inning?

[00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:35.900]
Who?

[00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:36.840]
Jake Feibler.

[00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:39.700]
Like I said, our favorite, not our most incompetent,

[00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:40.380]
our most inept.

[00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:42.760]
How about Murray Rose?

[00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:45.400]
He was a swimmer and in the 1802 Olympics,

[00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:48.040]
he won about 85 gold medals of swimmer from our striker.

[00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:50.100]
From down under, Murray Rose was Jewish and Christel

[00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:51.640]
named Murray Rose, you know.

[00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:52.740]
So anyway, we do it.

[00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:53.840]
He was hot too, man.

[00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:54.200]
Whoo!

[00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:56.520]
But anyway, and what about the Mark Spitz?

[00:29:58.880 --> 00:29:59.280]
Huh?

[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.020]
I don't want to get into work.

[00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:05.440]
Most Saturdays the league, along with it's sisterly,

[00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:07.780]
from Boyton Beach, convenes at Village Park and Royal Union

[00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:10.660]
to play 30 football games.

[00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:13.680]
Slusher said he asked that these September 22nd games

[00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:15.900]
which fall on young Kiberbe moved to the following Sunday.

[00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:18.240]
He was told the change wouldn't be made,

[00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:20.060]
but that his son wouldn't be penalized

[00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:22.160]
for missing games and practices during the holidays.

[00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:25.980]
Mike Pignato, the league's president, declined to discuss the situation,

[00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:28.860]
didn't let it say it's difficult to reschedule game day

[00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:29.920]
for all the teams.

[00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:32.160]
Try getting 30 different groups of people,

[00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:34.640]
20 on a team together, and all the referees and volunteers

[00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:35.580]
that go with it, he said.

[00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:38.280]
Pignato said he didn't know how many kids in the league are Jewish.

[00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:43.060]
In emails to the slushes, Pignato said he received only one complaint

[00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:44.600]
about the games scheduled on young Kiberbe.

[00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:46.760]
He also wrote that the league would not schedule Sunday again.

[00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:48.200]
What day is young Kiberbe, by the way?

[00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:49.220]
It's next Saturday.

[00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:52.320]
It's the 22nd, it's a week from tomorrow.

[00:30:53.780 --> 00:30:55.280]
So what kind of a screwing is that?

[00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:56.940]
That means I can't take off for young Kiberbe,

[00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:58.500]
because everybody knows what a religious said,

[00:30:58.580 --> 00:30:59.880]
you I'm going to go to Shul.

[00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:02.840]
I'll drive there, because I'm Orthodox.

[00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:07.060]
The village has gotten involved to its park and recreation for,

[00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:08.360]
oh, I missed part of this.

[00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:13.080]
Pignato said he received only one complaint about the games scheduled on young Kiberbe.

[00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:15.140]
He also wrote that the league would not schedule Sunday games

[00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:16.900]
because of intolerance to minority religions,

[00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:18.700]
but because throughout my 50 years of existence,

[00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:21.360]
some days have seemed to have a theme of family day

[00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:22.660]
that involves all religions,

[00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:24.580]
includes the lives of all interiors, board members,

[00:31:24.740 --> 00:31:26.600]
all the referees who don't want to work on Sunday.

[00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:27.800]
What about the people in the NFL?

[00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:28.840]
That's what they want to do,

[00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:30.540]
is they want to watch an NFL football.

[00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:31.980]
Not fooling us.

[00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:35.360]
The village has gotten involved to its park and recreation board

[00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:38.360]
will meet tonight to consider a new policy that would for big games on the fields,

[00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:40.440]
during its holidays like young Kiberbe,

[00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:41.680]
Rajeshana Christmas and Easter,

[00:31:41.780 --> 00:31:45.160]
said Jim Barnes, the village's leisure services director,

[00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:47.080]
the policy is ordered to a staff policy

[00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:48.700]
that's in place now from village run programs.

[00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:50.720]
If the park board passes it,

[00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:52.580]
the policy will go to the village council for approval.

[00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:54.660]
The board means that 6 p.m. in the village hall

[00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:57.020]
at 14,000 green bar are boulevard.

[00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:00.080]
Barnes said it's the first time in his four years that the village

[00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:02.500]
has this kind of conflict between holidays and sports has occurred.

[00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:05.280]
Councilwoman Laura Cohen learned the problem

[00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:07.080]
when some Jewish parents approached her about it,

[00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:09.060]
her seven-year-old someplace football in the league.

[00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:10.940]
I think it's brought to our attention

[00:32:10.940 --> 00:32:12.680]
in an area we need to discuss as a council

[00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:14.120]
and come up with a policy on it, said,

[00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:16.160]
a Laura Cohen, and her brother Marty Cohen.

[00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:19.800]
How many people we got on this thing here?

[00:32:21.620 --> 00:32:21.940]
676.

[00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:24.620]
I mean, you've got to understand, this is the entire audience.

[00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:26.860]
And you wonder why we get no rational phone calls

[00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:29.020]
while we're sitting here talking to ourselves like talking

[00:32:29.020 --> 00:32:29.760]
into a tin can?

[00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:30.800]
I don't wonder.

[00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:31.420]
Is there any?

[00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:32.100]
Yeah, like that.

[00:32:32.660 --> 00:32:34.040]
What? Oh, you don't know, I don't wonder.

[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:35.500]
I don't need, I don't wonder either,

[00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:37.080]
because I see Johnny Joe, he's still there.

[00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:38.080]
He clears up Bell.

[00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:38.960]
Go get his name.

[00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:40.280]
Something best out of town.

[00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:42.480]
This is my brother, I've got a Bell.

[00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:43.620]
I'm a 60-year-old man.

[00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:44.140]
Bill Bell.

[00:32:44.140 --> 00:32:45.620]
Hey, fourth leader.

[00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:47.160]
Third guy, f***ing blow!

[00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:48.700]
This is Larry Craig calling.

[00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:49.920]
You can reach me on myself.

[00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:52.180]
All inspector is now willing to come out.

[00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:53.440]
Larry Craig.

[00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:58.540]
Republicans want you to go away.

[00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:00.200]
I'm willing to fight.

[00:33:00.300 --> 00:33:03.440]
What's your ego makes you try to stay?

[00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:08.520]
No one believes in Larry Craig.

[00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:10.300]
Stupidly.

[00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:12.520]
We've reached shape ice-state for little bits.

[00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:16.060]
I tried to have a man and heart to free.

[00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:20.820]
Tired of all your hypocrisy.

[00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:25.960]
Oh, Larry Craig, give up your seat.

[00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:34.480]
If you have to go then just go best you don't stay.

[00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:36.720]
He does my intent to resign.

[00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:38.580]
I knew dead.

[00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:42.060]
Something wrong you don't belong.

[00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:44.620]
Now Larry Craig.

[00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:47.780]
Larry Craig.

[00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:52.840]
Give me into the turn, son of a-

[00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:53.740]
I gave.

[00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:54.600]
And I give up.

[00:33:54.860 --> 00:33:57.980]
Your new office will be named of men.

[00:33:58.660 --> 00:34:03.160]
No one believes in Larry Craig.

[00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:08.960]
Hey Larry.

[00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:09.620]
You're fair.

[00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:10.640]
I'm going to sit on you.

[00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:12.020]
You're up.

[00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:15.220]
147 at 5.60 W.A.M.

[00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:19.180]
13th Hill 11th on a Friday, September,

[00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:20.300]
El Cautorsia, September.

[00:34:20.620 --> 00:34:22.380]
When does people come back?

[00:34:23.220 --> 00:34:24.400]
From, I guess, one.

[00:34:24.620 --> 00:34:24.620]

[00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:27.400]
Rainers from North, from Uranus, from outer space.

[00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:28.640]
We've got to be back in our schools.

[00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:30.900]
I'm not talking about those people.

[00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:32.760]
I'm talking about like the snowbirds, you know that.

[00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:34.220]
That's a good part of our audience.

[00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:36.040]
Uh, neurocasting.

[00:34:36.220 --> 00:34:36.680]
In case you haven't.

[00:34:36.700 --> 00:34:40.620]
I'll let you know because they show up in Hollywood and drove as a prog.

[00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:40.940]
Oh no, they drove.

[00:34:41.020 --> 00:34:41.140]
They drove you.

[00:34:41.220 --> 00:34:41.560]
You know something?

[00:34:42.180 --> 00:34:42.480]
No.

[00:34:42.640 --> 00:34:43.160]
I'll take it with you.

[00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:43.860]
It's really going to be bad.

[00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:44.340]
It's really going to be bad.

[00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:46.000]
Now you're going to have, I don't know, it's good for you.

[00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:50.020]
The frogs won't be coming because of the incredibly weak.

[00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:52.260]
Now let me turn it around.

[00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:53.080]
Let me think about the other way.

[00:34:53.220 --> 00:34:54.620]
I guess, again, it works the other way.

[00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:58.860]
The Canadian dollars are the 30-year high now thanks to George Bush and the trillion

[00:34:58.860 --> 00:35:00.640]
dollars they've flushed down the toilet in Iraq.

[00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:05.140]
And so now the Canadian dollar, the loony, is up to, let me take a puke at it here

[00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:06.240]
on the business network.

[00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:07.880]
And I'm going to scream.

[00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:09.800]
I'll let out such a good shrie when I see it.

[00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:14.980]
It was over 96 cents when I looked at it like, oh, geez, oh, that's not the right number.

[00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:17.280]
Can you believe that?

[00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:19.020]
So in other words, it's almost even Stephen.

[00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:20.060]
Wow.

[00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:22.180]
Is that pathetic or what?

[00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:23.560]
Yeah, what?

[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:24.000]

[00:35:25.380 --> 00:35:30.440]
No, no, 96.99, it's almost 97 cents.

[00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:33.520]
Do you understand how devastating that is?

[00:35:33.780 --> 00:35:33.900]
No.

[00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:36.500]
So that means there's going to be a lot of frogs coming down there because they're

[00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:37.800]
about to actually work something out.

[00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:42.740]
You're going to be dead-yewed with frogs from Quebec.

[00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:43.220]
Yeah.

[00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:45.420]
Each being on Quebecer.

[00:35:45.580 --> 00:35:48.360]
Boy, they are, like I said, the slime of the earth, the French.

[00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:49.560]
I don't know what that's all about.

[00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:52.420]
I hope we have some French people listening out there because believe you me,

[00:35:52.420 --> 00:35:54.900]
we appreciate the fact you're listening, but we still can't sustain you.

[00:35:55.420 --> 00:35:57.620]
And take your French and shove it.

[00:35:58.200 --> 00:35:58.460]
God.

[00:35:58.960 --> 00:35:59.480]
I'm serious.

[00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:04.540]
If you walked in with a fistful of $1,000 bills into retail outlet Montreal,

[00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:08.280]
if your body was covered with $1,000 bills and you didn't speak French,

[00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:09.340]
they don't want to do business with it.

[00:36:09.380 --> 00:36:10.360]
They don't even talk to you.

[00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:11.160]
They don't want to know for me.

[00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:13.320]
Well, that keeps it simple then.

[00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:15.120]
Yeah, you just don't go there.

[00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:15.460]
That's right.

[00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:17.500]
697 people are listening.

[00:36:17.620 --> 00:36:18.100]
That's a start.

[00:36:18.100 --> 00:36:19.020]
That's our ethnic survey.

[00:36:19.020 --> 00:36:24.120]
Which are you Anglo-Mail, non-Hispanic, 473, about 68%.

[00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:27.020]
Hispanic, male, 87, 12.4%.

[00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:29.100]
Subhuman 51.

[00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:29.840]
We believe that.

[00:36:30.140 --> 00:36:31.520]
So you don't like that being on there.

[00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:32.080]
I think it's nothing.

[00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:33.460]
What?

[00:36:33.620 --> 00:36:34.200]
Should we take it off?

[00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:35.580]
It's too late now.

[00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:37.420]
It's never too late.

[00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:39.900]
Although Cornelia's brother is insisting to roast it.

[00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:41.100]
It's too late to remember back to me.

[00:36:41.260 --> 00:36:43.220]
It's like the same as like I hate this poll or something.

[00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:43.440]
You know.

[00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:47.240]
It adds a little levity to it.

[00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:49.780]
And otherwise very boring matter-of-fact kind of survey.

[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:51.300]
Without a lot of levity, it's not done.

[00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:52.040]
What?

[00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:54.580]
We could add a lot of levity then.

[00:36:56.700 --> 00:36:57.460]
What does that mean?

[00:36:57.840 --> 00:37:00.300]
We're going to put way more funny choices than just that on there.

[00:37:00.620 --> 00:37:01.880]
All right, Eric, take it off of there.

[00:37:02.060 --> 00:37:03.680]
But then that's going to bring us down to like 697.

[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.820]
You put it like I'm a cat, I'm a dog, you know, I'm an alien from another animal.

[00:37:07.820 --> 00:37:08.160]
What about that?

[00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:10.720]
Okay, well take some human off of there.

[00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:11.500]
Eric will do it.

[00:37:12.660 --> 00:37:14.980]
Anglo-Female 47, black male 23.

[00:37:14.980 --> 00:37:19.020]
In other words, you're taking these polls very seriously even though you don't can't stand them.

[00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:24.180]
Either you know, pick one, is it a survey or is it a joke?

[00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:25.120]
Or is it just a joke?

[00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:25.620]
Pick one.

[00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:26.140]
Huh?

[00:37:26.860 --> 00:37:28.300]
I'm picking one right now and we're going to have a-

[00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:28.640]
Oh geez.

[00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:32.480]
I can't tell you where to win it from, but you can imagine.

[00:37:32.580 --> 00:37:32.960]
I'm back home.

[00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:33.260]
Ooh.

[00:37:34.420 --> 00:37:35.700]
Looked a little CD to me.

[00:37:35.860 --> 00:37:42.500]
Anglo-Female 47, black male 24, Native American male 6, Hispanic female still only 4.

[00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:47.380]
See if we take those 52 off of the sub-humans it's going to be bad.

[00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:50.340]
But go ahead Eric, take it off of the weekend and let-

[00:37:51.020 --> 00:37:55.180]
Hispanic female 4, black female 3, our ethnic ladies not too many.

[00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:59.360]
Native American female only 1, Asian female and Asian male 1 apiece.

[00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:02.740]
I'm thinking the Asian female might be Eric's wife you think?

[00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:04.240]
Maybe.

[00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:05.680]
I'm sure he already voted.

[00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:06.480]
Why?

[00:38:06.740 --> 00:38:08.480]
I'm sure he already voted from his household.

[00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:10.520]
What does that mean?

[00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:13.200]
You know you can only vote once per you know IP address.

[00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:16.900]
The pool is down while Eric takes off sub-human and it's going to be embarrassing now.

[00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:17.160]
It's gone.

[00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:19.100]
Oh, it's gone already?

[00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:22.300]
No, the pool is down, he's reworking it.

[00:38:22.580 --> 00:38:23.060]
Oh I see.

[00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:24.000]
Why do you say that?

[00:38:24.140 --> 00:38:25.700]
Why do you just talk out of your ass?

[00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:27.220]
Well, it's down.

[00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:27.920]
It's down.

[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:31.720]
I mean I know Eric is very good, but it's going to take him like maybe 20, 30 seconds.

[00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:32.760]
But 30 man.

[00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:37.040]
I'll move that idiotic and then those 52 people maybe they'll have the co-hounds to come back on here

[00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:40.080]
and tell us who they are instead of trying to be a bunch of smart-asses, okay?

[00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:41.360]
Like the callers.

[00:38:41.780 --> 00:38:44.060]
I called the other day and made a funny sound.

[00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:45.960]
I hope yeah.

[00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:46.620]
Remember that?

[00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:47.340]
That was on my shirt.

[00:38:47.940 --> 00:38:48.520]
That was Bobby.

[00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:49.980]
I don't hear from Bobby anymore.

[00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:53.580]
Almost into people on my face to be very honest with you, but who cares?

[00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:55.840]
I hear from the important people.

[00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:00.640]
I hear from the professor and Brandon and heard from Mike at FSU this morning, which I'll

[00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:02.300]
get back to you one of these days, Mike, very soon.

[00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:03.960]
He's a good kid.

[00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:05.320]
Who else?

[00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:06.620]
It's about it.

[00:39:06.980 --> 00:39:09.540]
And then Sport and Hollywood, you depressing man, go away.

[00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:12.900]
The people I am hearing from out there now, most of them I don't want to like Charlie be

[00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:13.600]
again coming back.

[00:39:14.060 --> 00:39:17.240]
We're glad to have you back, Charlie, but you're star with the polls, man.

[00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:18.560]
I wouldn't wish those on anybody.

[00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:20.560]
I would wish them on Joey Remmelts.

[00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:21.440]
Well, look at that.

[00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:22.360]
Eric did a fine job.

[00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:23.440]
The only problem is now.

[00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:26.220]
We're down to 654 folks on there.

[00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:27.800]
Boy, we're going to be hard pressed against them.

[00:39:27.860 --> 00:39:28.740]
The thousand of them I think.

[00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:30.440]
And this is just a survey.

[00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:32.360]
Now we'll do it.

[00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:33.520]
You sure of that?

[00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:33.820]
Yes.

[00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:39.060]
Watchdog asks why Bush's kid brother is getting federal bucks.

[00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:40.200]
Oh, no.

[00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:46.400]
An independent watchdog, agencies asked the Department of Education to investigate why

[00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:52.080]
President Bush's younger brother, Neil, has received money or mark for the President's

[00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:55.880]
signature education initiative to sell a curriculum program that hasn't been subjected

[00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:57.620]
to the rigorous evaluation of deserves.

[00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:00.340]
Bunch of crooks, baby.

[00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:01.320]
That's what it's all about.

[00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:04.920]
A bunch of crooks, not just the Bush family, all the families.

[00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:06.540]
The Rockefeller is the Kennedy's.

[00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:07.220]
You name it.

[00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:08.080]
All the families.

[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:09.580]
The Clintons.

[00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:10.920]
Oh, no.

[00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:11.860]
You can't say that.

[00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:12.940]
I just did.

[00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:18.600]
Neil Bush 52, who has no background whatsoever in education, found an ignite.

[00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:23.240]
Ignite learning in 1999 with donations from his parents and a slate of international

[00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:27.400]
business interests, the company produces curriculum on wheels devices, computer

[00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:31.400]
projectors that are preloaded with software aimed at preparing students for standardized

[00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:35.840]
tests that are the central tend to the presence no child left behind law.

[00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:36.760]
No child.

[00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:38.880]
Remember that song, Honey Child by Martin Van Dillis?

[00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:41.000]
It's on the flip side of Nancy on the street by the way.

[00:40:41.300 --> 00:40:41.700]
I had no idea.

[00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:42.740]
Well, there you go.

[00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:45.420]
Honey Child, yeah, I think you've got it, it's a good song.

[00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:48.480]
I got it here somewhere, but I'm sure I'm not going to look for it.

[00:40:49.020 --> 00:40:51.900]
On a Friday when we're supposed to be playing a tape, honey child, there it is.

[00:40:53.860 --> 00:40:55.800]
That's on the flip side of what Nancy on the street.

[00:40:57.620 --> 00:40:59.280]
And it's there with some dials.

[00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:01.120]
Yeah, honey child, that's the menus.

[00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:03.320]
I just like that.

[00:41:03.460 --> 00:41:04.840]
I thought you were just slurry.

[00:41:07.860 --> 00:41:08.660]
Ethnic slurry.

[00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:10.300]
Honey Child.

[00:41:11.900 --> 00:41:16.700]
The cows, COW, curriculum on wheels are sold to school districts that have cost a

[00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:20.780]
3840 to 200 bucks although they haven't been subjected to peer reviewed signs of

[00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:24.300]
study, according to citizens for responsibility and ethics in Washington.

[00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:28.860]
Oh, cruise says nearly a million dollars have been spent on the systems in 16 schools

[00:41:28.860 --> 00:41:33.260]
which are mostly in Texas where George W. served as governor before his election in 2004

[00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:35.840]
to where brother Jeb Bush was governor, Fadass Jen.

[00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:40.920]
The watchdog group is requesting an investigation from the education department's inspector general

[00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:44.920]
alleging that the ignite systems do not meet the standards laid out by Congress dictating

[00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:46.660]
how NCLB funds can be spent.

[00:41:47.220 --> 00:41:50.700]
It is astonishing that tax, I'm going to start screaming.

[00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:52.260]
Like Joe Rose does on the spot.

[00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:53.480]
It is astonishing.

[00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:59.220]
That taxpayer dollars are being spent on unproven educational projects to the financial

[00:41:59.220 --> 00:42:00.440]
benefit of the president's brother.

[00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:03.100]
Melanie Sloan, cruise executive director said in news release.

[00:42:03.540 --> 00:42:07.400]
The IG should investigate whether children's educations are being sacrificed so that Neil

[00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:08.880]
Bush can break in federal funds.

[00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:10.760]
And we all know the answer is absolutely.

[00:42:11.460 --> 00:42:11.460]

[00:42:11.860 --> 00:42:15.720]
Neil Bush first attracted public scrutiny for his role in the SNL scandals of late 80s when

[00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:17.780]
a Colorado SNL who's 40 served failed.

[00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:20.900]
That scandal cost the taxpayers $1.6 billion.

[00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:24.220]
Remember the Silverado banking scandal?

[00:42:24.220 --> 00:42:24.760]
Sure we do.

[00:42:25.060 --> 00:42:28.320]
Some school districts identified by crews spend hundreds of thousands of dollars in federal

[00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:32.140]
money on the mobile projectors which include curriculum for math, science, and social studies.

[00:42:32.460 --> 00:42:37.500]
In addition to their baseline cost, $3800 for a single sub-deck cow or $4200 for one covering

[00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:38.300]
all three subjects.

[00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:42.840]
The units imposed on schools a $1,000 annual licensing and upkeep fee crews says.

[00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:47.480]
Schools also had the option of purchasing lifetime contracts for $6800 for the New

[00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:48.140]
York Times.

[00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:52.760]
Although there's no direct evidence of presidential nepotism on behalf of his baby brother,

[00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:56.740]
Neil Bush did benefit from his mother's large ass in the wake of Hurricane Katrina last

[00:42:56.740 --> 00:42:57.000]
year.

[00:42:57.420 --> 00:43:00.560]
Barbara Bush donated an undisclosed amount of money to a hurricane relief fund overseen

[00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:02.900]
by former president, Stewart-Turber, Walker Bush and Bill Clinton.

[00:43:03.300 --> 00:43:07.280]
In earmark, part of those funds for purchase of Ignite software must be just a coincidence,

[00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:07.840]
of course.

[00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:11.560]
An interview earlier this year with the Times Neil Bush denied using his brother's position

[00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:12.400]
to purchase his product.

[00:43:12.780 --> 00:43:16.000]
He claimed he was inspired to start the company after struggling with this Lexi while he

[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:16.500]
was in school.

[00:43:16.940 --> 00:43:17.260]
Right.

[00:43:18.900 --> 00:43:22.160]
Ignite's website includes anecdotal testimonials from teachers who have used the program,

[00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:25.420]
but some teachers are less than impressed with the system, saying it's a plant's

[00:43:25.420 --> 00:43:27.600]
wrote memorization for critical thinking skills.

[00:43:28.220 --> 00:43:32.660]
As a review, it uses catchy phrases and tunes, Jeremy Seafker, a middle school science teacher

[00:43:32.660 --> 00:43:35.800]
who has used the program for all the times, but as far as scientific investigation and

[00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:37.100]
inquiry, I don't think it's very good.

[00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:41.160]
Ironically, among the schools that have shunned the program is a Texas Elementary School

[00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:42.700]
named for Neil Bush's father.

[00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:45.540]
After reviewing the program, Bush is not interested.

[00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:50.840]
Our principal of George H. Herbert Walker Bush Elementary in Midland, Texas wrote,

[00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:54.640]
in the email to ignite obtained by crew, we feel our money is better spent elsewhere.

[00:43:55.500 --> 00:43:56.500]
We ain't interested.

[00:43:57.200 --> 00:43:59.380]
Oh, there's Bill Bollacek who got fine a half a million bucks.

[00:44:00.180 --> 00:44:01.360]
Tom Brady will hand it over to him.

[00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:01.980]
No problem, right?

[00:44:03.020 --> 00:44:03.240]
All right.

[00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:04.860]
670 people on the survey.

[00:44:04.860 --> 00:44:08.380]
Now, George, please now that we got that Indiana crap off of there.

[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.760]
And we got, and now we got two Asian males just because of that.

[00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:12.180]
See that?

[00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:15.300]
Some people were too embarrassed to come on there because they thought it was just a goofball

[00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:15.480]
part.

[00:44:16.060 --> 00:44:17.140]
I didn't take it seriously.

[00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:19.180]
Take it seriously, man.

[00:44:19.380 --> 00:44:19.980]
Take it seriously.

[00:44:20.140 --> 00:44:22.020]
420 or 560 QAM.

[00:44:22.200 --> 00:44:23.800]
And the sports leader.

[00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:25.600]
This is the Neil Roger show.

[00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:27.660]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, my God.

[00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:28.400]
This is your brain.

[00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:31.360]
Any questions?

[00:44:38.100 --> 00:44:41.500]
I know Congressman Neymar Foley.

[00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:47.900]
We're at the $3 bill on Republican Foley.

[00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:53.780]
He goes trolling in the chat room.

[00:44:56.180 --> 00:44:59.820]
Look in for young page boys that are young and smooth.

[00:45:03.380 --> 00:45:06.080]
Bush Roy was curved with the hot mark face.

[00:45:06.580 --> 00:45:12.240]
He invites me up to this place for Republican man page grab ass games.

[00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:18.640]
Well, I told my congressman, hey, go go wrong.

[00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:22.940]
Remove your tongue.

[00:45:22.940 --> 00:45:25.640]
I gotta go home.

[00:45:27.260 --> 00:45:30.780]
He said the only other thing that I want to do.

[00:45:33.140 --> 00:45:36.680]
They stick my nose in the round lounds of your moon.

[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:44.360]
A petapile Republican Greek, but here's the spin.

[00:45:44.900 --> 00:45:45.860]
They'll get you the thing.

[00:45:45.860 --> 00:45:49.060]
Mark Foley had too much to drink.

[00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:16.440]
It's $1.103 at $5.60 over to QAM.

[00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:17.580]
Happy Friday to you.

[00:46:17.580 --> 00:46:19.680]
Happy New Year.

[00:46:24.380 --> 00:46:29.680]
What's his name?

[00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:36.280]
