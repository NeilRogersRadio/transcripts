[00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:04.060]
owdie

[00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:25.020]
the tongue and tongue

[00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.260]
but they'll get it through it

[00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.000]
Tosses their hot dogs when your fin is too wet

[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.480]
Heavily with the K-Miles

[00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.100]
Oh, it's a quick time for K-Miles

[00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.200]
And all employees as they K-Miles

[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.460]
Get fired out of the way

[00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.380]
No more pills on two shots but underwear

[00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.460]
No more fussy slippers to 99 a pair

[00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.300]
No more obnoxious, defy me this day

[00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.160]
Too bad the night's coming back here again

[00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.640]
Tell me where the K-Miles

[00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:07.440]
Oh, now it's quick time for K-Miles

[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.460]
And all employees as they K-Miles

[00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.360]
Get fired out of the way

[00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.800]
There's the word schwa come to mind, huh?

[00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.800]
But I used to shop when I was there

[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.900]
When I was there six, seven years ago

[00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.160]
I shopped at the K-Miles just to piss off the people at Walmart

[00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.720]
Yeah, I do that with Tosses

[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:30.840]
Not that they paid any attention

[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.280]
But I shouldn't have held a big sign

[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.640]
Hey, I'm the Elijah's, I'm shoppin' at K-Miles

[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.940]
Just because I can't stand you back to do with their Walmart

[00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:38.800]
And they always say, yeah, who cares?

[00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.800]
Who cares, you fad old faggot?

[00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.800]
That's what they would've said

[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.680]
By the way, I got a fact yesterday afternoon

[00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.300]
Ladies and gentlemen, this is quite a day today for me

[00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.980]
This is a revolutionary day, this is two in a row

[00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.460]
Now what was yesterday was such a big deal above

[00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:52.320]
I don't know, was Huzha

[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.300]
Oh, with early release day

[00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.200]
Well, that's right, we had the unexpected Marlon's Astros game

[00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.500]
How'd that come out Chris, who won a game?

[00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:59.160]
Anybody care?

[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.820]
No, they lost four to them

[00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.120]
Oh, the Marlon's lost?

[00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:03.800]
Oh, the Marlon's, we don't care

[00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.560]
And today is a revolutionary, every day

[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.820]
Just keeps bringing bigger and better, more wonderful news

[00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.460]
The sun is shining, it's gonna be

[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.220]
Let's see what the temperature is in case castrenable

[00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.560]
Once they're ready on the sleeve and put it on the show tomorrow

[00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.700]
Let's see, oh, it's minus 10

[00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.200]
It looks really nice sitting here looking outside

[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.480]
What's that? It's gonna be only a zero

[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.420]
But sunny, it's beautiful

[00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.200]
Camarro's gonna be five, which is 41 and Thursday

[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.740]
It's gonna be 18 Celsius

[00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:32.660]
Alright, 65 degrees

[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.980]
But that's gonna be a good day for me to do the show running around naked

[00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.260]
My box is sure it's outside on the street, wouldn't it be good?

[00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.860]
Yeah, it would be, take that cordless mic with you

[00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.320]
No, I could do it

[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.780]
So yesterday afternoon, I get, let's see, what's the time of this?

[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:45.660]
I don't know what it is

[00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.920]
I don't know, like

[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.200]
No, it's funny, because it says 11.44 am, which is not the correct time

[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.800]
No, I guess the facts machine has the wrong time on it

[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:54.960]
Must be on the specific time

[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.140]
One minute after the end of the show

[00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.640]
No, two all-one yesterday afternoon, I get a fact from George Rodriguez

[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.560]
And it says, it's from the script of the Godfather

[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:10.680]
And it says, Salvatortescio brings in Luca Brassi's bulletproof vest

[00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.520]
Delivered with a fish inside

[00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.860]
Sonny Santino says, what the hell is this?

[00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:19.180]
And then...

[00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.720]
Luca Brassi sleeps with the fish

[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.880]
It's a Sicilian message, it means Luca Brassi sleeps with the fish

[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.400]
It says, Pete Clemenza

[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.000]
Right

[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.540]
And George writes, I looked it up, you're right, I'm wrong

[00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.020]
Well, that's pretty powerful, of course, isn't it?

[00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:32.740]
Is that the way the world works?

[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.460]
That's the wrong way, I'm right, all the time, just ask me and I'll tell you

[00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:37.720]
I mean, what's it I'm all I get right? Not too often

[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.220]
Luca Brassi sleeps with the fish

[00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:40.380]
Let's just play that all of it, huh?

[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:41.940]
Yeah, I like it a lot

[00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.140]
Luca Brassi sleeps with the fish

[00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.380]
Can't you tell by the...

[00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:45.600]
Luca Brassi sleeps with the fish

[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.820]
Jesus, God, anybody that's seen a movie 600 times like we all have

[00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.060]
and you don't know that's Clemenza?

[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.900]
In fact, I want you to listen, let's see

[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.440]
Canoli, let's try and be able to get 400 drop-ins on here

[00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.400]
Now let's listen to some Tessio, huh?

[00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.180]
Get some Tessio, so you can hear how they sound

[00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.620]
We all have an E-Tessio, we gotta have that

[00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.180]
Forget about words, we listen

[00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.000]
It leaves it good, take the Canoli

[00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.780]
Sounds different

[00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:11.860]
It sounds different, it sleeps with the fish

[00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.720]
It sounds different

[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.840]
You gotta have the get me off the...

[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.320]
Even Sunny won't be able to call up Luca Brassi

[00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.500]
Yeah, well, let me worry about Luca

[00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.660]
The interesting part about this thing is that all these years we've been calling him Luca Brassi

[00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:29.740]
And his name is...

[00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:30.200]
Luca Brassi

[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.680]
Yeah, it's Brassi, we're trying to renew that, like in Brassi

[00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.500]
In fact, even in the DCS here, it's got Luca Brassi under...

[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:38.880]
Long Coyote

[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.500]
Under that drop, I put it that...

[00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.840]
That Clemenza line, because Clemenza says Brassi

[00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:46.060]
Do you know what I mean?

[00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:47.260]
Do I have to find it again?

[00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.640]
Yes, I just got off it at them, a section here

[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.220]
Now you're gonna make me go back there again?

[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.580]
Yes

[00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.560]
Where Clemenza, Pete Clemenza says...

[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:54.960]
Luca Brassi sleeps with the fish

[00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.780]
Yes, it's Brassi, Brassi

[00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:57.760]
Not Brassi

[00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:58.640]
Grazie

[00:04:59.340 --> 00:04:59.780]
Grazie

[00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.700]
Grazie

[00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.800]
Yeah, let's start Palatariani on the Oshawa

[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:04.660]
There we go

[00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:05.600]
Mamma mia

[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:06.320]
Yeah, Mamma mia

[00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:08.780]
That's the spicy meatball

[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:11.080]
Mamma mia

[00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.160]
Anyway, let's get this thing going to do now

[00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:17.220]
Everybody to call in yesterday is ready to call back again today and then someone we had a short...

[00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:17.340]
What?

[00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.420]
That was great, that's my kind of show

[00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:22.560]
Right, see if you can say something different today too, that'd be really good

[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.700]
No, I like the guy, the young guy, the call didn't...

[00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:26.600]
I don't wanna say kid, I don't know how old he was

[00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.620]
It means to me anybody under 80 is a kid

[00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:31.440]
But he said, I don't know what I'm supposed to say

[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:32.860]
That was good

[00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:35.380]
Maybe he'll call back and say that again today, what do you think?

[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.480]
Maybe he'll have something to say

[00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:40.160]
I'm kinda refining, I'm refining the show, Jack Ma'am

[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.560]
I'm just not refining, I'm just retuning it, I'm rejiggering it, can I say that?

[00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:43.900]
No

[00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:44.600]
No

[00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:47.940]
I'm re-tooling it, I don't think I can say that either

[00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:49.420]
Retuning, fine tuning

[00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.060]
W-Q-A-M, hello

[00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:55.180]
Dolphin Denny

[00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:59.860]
Calling from the other side, Dolphin Denny is dead

[00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:02.600]
Yeah, we hit that story yesterday and a lot of people had parties overnight

[00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:03.600]
That's bad

[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.120]
W-Q-A-M, hello

[00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:08.700]
Neil, a little question for you real quick

[00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:12.300]
Do you remember Mary's restaurant up there in...

[00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:16.480]
Sure, 125th and 441, I used to live right by there, Twin Lakes Racket Club

[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:17.760]
I've heard you talked about the other last hole

[00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:19.240]

[00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:23.120]
Do you remember the 3-tarded bus point of you used to work there?

[00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:26.260]
No, but I remember one of the waiters was a... A... A treane

[00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.720]
Yes, so one of the waitresses was a guy

[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.060]
There was one old waitress

[00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:35.860]
He called me on a year-one there. Years ago, there was what?

[00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:39.400]
And the friend of mine used to work there, years before years

[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.080]
He's probably 40 years old, still bumping tables

[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:47.200]
and he said one of the waitresses there was sucked up mean middle ladies she

[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:50.320]
challenged him to a fight what I must have been this one I must have been

out of all I said Rosenstein cramps you keep it up dancing with a star that's

[00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:09.380]
worth that anyway dog Thompson says I'm trying and failing to understand why

[00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:12.200]
me the press gave an indicted former member of Congress a corrupt

[00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:16.320]
politician to resign and disgrace a forum upon which to expose hate and

[00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:19.380]
division Sunday as president Bush is illegal in a moral Iraq war

[00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:24.340]
enters its 50 year is Tim Russell so desperate for controversy that he has to

[00:17:24.340 --> 00:17:28.140]
book Tom delay easily one of the most criminal political hacks in Washington on

[00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:31.920]
the top rated Sunday news talk show and let him call war protesters unpatriotic

[00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:34.900]
and claim that anybody wants to end the Iraq war is aiding and abiding the

[00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:40.120]
enemy delay is political vermin one step away from a jail cell for

[00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:43.540]
influence peddling and taking grabs and yet there he was on eat the press being

[00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:47.420]
treated with difference by Lackdog Russert instead of pretending to any

[00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:51.180]
standard journalism or decency Russert let delay expand on why he thinks

[00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:54.740]
those who protest the war are not patriots said delay well it's my opinion

[00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:58.640]
that when you go to war we ought to all come together so to speak we can debate

[00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:01.640]
going to war that's a legitimate debate but once you have our soldiers and

[00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:04.540]
our our young people dying on the battlefield we should come together and we

[00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:07.820]
shouldn't have what we had yesterday in the mall in Washington DC when those

[00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:11.200]
are not in my mind my opinion patriots that are talking about impeaching

[00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:15.260]
they commander in chief when asked if he thought congressional attempts to

[00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:17.520]
set it with drawday forgetting the hell out of a rack fell into the same

[00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:21.140]
category delay replied I think it's aiding and abiding the enemy when you tell

[00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:24.200]
the enemy what your strategy is that's aiding and abiding the enemy because they

[00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:28.240]
can use that strategy come back and harm your soldiers Russert who some

[00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:31.400]
feels a strong interview or let delay walk all over him when he tried to

[00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:34.520]
question delay on his praise a failed former secretary defense rums for

[00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:37.920]
all delay shot back the premise of your question is always put forward

[00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:41.100]
without the rest of the story and maybe we ought to have Paul Harvey here to talk

[00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:46.040]
about the rest of the story good day Russert said nothing and didn't push to

[00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:49.880]
get an answer to his question and steady went to another guest it's bad enough

[00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:53.320]
that corrupt slime like Tom Delay remained in Congress as long as he did it's

[00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:56.500]
worse that after as many crimes finally cut up with him and he was forced to

[00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:59.460]
resign by his own Republican colleagues he's then given a podium on a

[00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:03.780]
national news show to continue his hate filled diet tribes his claim that we

[00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:06.720]
ought to all come together as political hypocrisy of the worst kind in Congress

[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:10.500]
delay thrived on dividing and conquering he refused to cooperate work to destroy

[00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:14.880]
any attempts at coalition building Tom Delay is a crook he was so corrupt that

[00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:17.840]
even in the past Republican leadership of Congress itself the most

[00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:21.800]
corrupt in modern times they could no longer tolerate his presence Tim Russert

[00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:25.680]
is not a journalist he's a political hack an on practicing lawyer who worked

[00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:28.820]
for New York Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan in New York Governor Mario Cuomo

[00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:33.020]
Crooks belong in jail not on television political hacks belong in the dust

[00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:36.580]
been of history Tim Russert owes his viewers an apology for giving a crook

[00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:39.940]
a national form then he owes journalism the decency to resign and let

[00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:43.860]
somebody with real credentials take over eat the press nice going doggy how do

[00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:49.600]

being out as you positive he had like one leg out and the other one four toes out you know I mean

and having children and Steve says I don't think it works that way Harry like that well some

[00:38:56.980 --> 00:39:01.440]
like that in fact the Harry would say I guess you got to find a white first oh and then Harry would

[00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:12.560]
say let me have another beer what it's true yeah what nothing it's funny it is that story

[00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:19.320]

Men who fall of other men.

[00:45:42.370 --> 00:45:45.630]
scene? Uh-huh. And then all of a sudden they like pop right on the floor again. Poor

[00:45:45.630 --> 00:45:53.850]
howard bill. Just like that. Shark Valley Park bike or tram ride to see the alligators

[00:45:53.850 --> 00:45:58.510]

[00:45:58.510 --> 00:46:01.810]
that up for the guy to get some stuff because I don't have a shredder. I got a shredder

[00:46:01.810 --> 00:46:06.050]

[00:46:23.490 --> 00:46:32.550]
1200 leaked. WDQAM. Hello. Hi. This is Bruce. I'm the Q1st of what man it is. WDQAM. Hello.

[00:46:33.590 --> 00:46:40.690]
Hey, you know, you know, last week they were showing JFK on HBO and it's kind of scary.

[00:46:40.690 --> 00:46:44.630]
Probably looking good by now. Yeah. Yeah. He's kind of rotting wave. Anyway, the similarities

[00:46:44.630 --> 00:46:48.530]
between the way they did things back then with Jim Garrison and the discrediting him and

[00:46:48.530 --> 00:46:52.850]
everything. Either what they do today. They probably watched the movie before the inauguration

[00:46:52.850 --> 00:46:57.770]
and got the ideas from that. But anyway, the only thing to call and tell you your savage

[00:46:57.770 --> 00:47:03.910]
and I'm out of material. Okay. So he said, which 5.670560 and pound 560 in the

[00:47:03.910 --> 00:47:09.970]
Verizon singular wireless line. WDQAM. Hello. Hi. I would like to know if you or George

[00:47:09.970 --> 00:47:16.210]
has seen a movie called The Rivers of Crafts? No. Yes. George says yes. I say no. And?

[00:47:16.930 --> 00:47:22.130]
George, didn't make any sense to you at all if you like it? There were funny parts and

[00:47:22.130 --> 00:47:29.050]
other. You like it? Yeah. Okay. I didn't get it. So what did you think of it? Well, my

[00:47:29.050 --> 00:47:32.930]
boyfriend brought it over and I only watched 15 minutes of it because it was really strange.

[00:47:32.930 --> 00:47:37.930]
I couldn't watch it. I didn't get it. It's not for everyone. Okay. Thank you. What's

[00:47:37.930 --> 00:47:43.970]
it about? It's a bunch of comedians telling the same joke over and over again. It is? Yeah.

[00:47:46.150 --> 00:47:50.730]
Are you serious? Sure. I've got you. I've got you. I've got you. I've got you.

[00:48:16.990 --> 00:48:20.710]
I'm a senior. I'm a senior. I'm a senior. I'm a senior. I'm a senior. I'm a senior. I'm a senior.

[00:48:22.030 --> 00:48:27.990]
Hello. Yes. Hey. Can I speak with Neil? Speaking. Neil, how are you doing? Okay. How are you doing?

[00:48:28.570 --> 00:48:34.650]
I'm doing good. Doing good. Hey, I got one for the poll. Yeah. The question was what? What was the

[00:48:34.650 --> 00:48:39.010]
question again? How could you have one for the poll if you don't know what the question is?

[00:48:39.110 --> 00:48:43.470]
No, it was okay. So when someone comes down here, what they shouldn't miss, right? Right. That's correct.

[00:48:43.470 --> 00:48:53.470]
Okay. They shouldn't miss or damn fly it out. That's not bad. I like that. I like that. That's good. If someone from

[00:48:54.130 --> 00:49:00.210]
out of town visits South Florida, make sure they don't miss their outgoing. That's great. How's that? Right. Don't you like that?

[00:49:00.510 --> 00:49:05.410]
I like it. That's beautiful. In fact, let me ask the entire audience. Do you like it? Yeah, they like it.

[00:49:06.230 --> 00:49:11.230]
You're getting a sitting ovation, sir. Excellent job. Okay. That was fantastic. You see, if we take 40,000

[00:49:11.230 --> 00:49:18.990]
calls like this, we're going to put this. See, the reason I'm doing this is because I feel sometimes I feel like we're

[00:49:18.990 --> 00:49:24.430]
dying over here. You know what I mean? Like we're just drowning on the Titanic. And this station seems to be

[00:49:24.430 --> 00:49:29.470]
a stale. His last year is Wonder Bread. That's the line I used yesterday, but you know, you can never say that too often.

[00:49:30.090 --> 00:49:36.730]
Because Wonder Bread fills you eight different ways. But it's like cotton pantons, a matter of fact, wonder bread, isn't it?

[00:49:36.730 --> 00:49:42.430]
Yeah, that's good. And so I think we got to like revitalize this place. I mean, who else is going to do it

[00:49:42.430 --> 00:49:50.430]
beside the legendary Neil? Okay? And read a little bit of life back into this sleepy, dying giant. You know, because there's no football going on

[00:49:50.430 --> 00:49:57.550]
now for a long time. And even the draft show is not until April 15 or something like that. And this is that time of the

[00:49:57.550 --> 00:50:02.570]
year. I mean, hockey, anybody care about the panties or the national hockey league or the playoffs? Who's going to make it?

[00:50:02.570 --> 00:50:08.070]
Anybody care even a little bit about that? And of course the heat. Well, you know, they wonder all last year. Yeah, who cares?

[00:50:08.890 --> 00:50:10.830]
WDQ-AM, hello. Hold on.

[00:50:13.150 --> 00:50:15.570]
Okay. WDQ-AM, hello.

[00:50:16.350 --> 00:50:18.470]
Yeah, good morning, my friend. Good morning, sir.

[00:50:18.970 --> 00:50:24.590]
What are you going to do about this? This is pretty my two-year-old Golden Wichiro and Steve, the damn dog food.

[00:50:26.630 --> 00:50:30.650]
So I'm going to see what he's going to get to happen from now on.

[00:50:31.170 --> 00:50:37.030]
I feed him people food. Okay? Feed him, uh, shat-telling all would be good. Yeah, see everybody's all whipped up about that.

[00:50:37.170 --> 00:50:41.290]
You see a bunch of animals die from that dog food. I got the story in my pile here. I'll never get to it though.

[00:50:42.450 --> 00:50:48.890]
Do you think I should? I think you should. It's important dog lover like we are. Dog lover like we are.

[00:50:49.310 --> 00:50:56.730]
Well, I like dogs too. Still that one. Yeah. I wish I could have a dog here, man. I wish, oh, here it is.

[00:50:56.730 --> 00:50:59.750]
Pedal owners nervous over the fallout from dual-gattainted food.

[00:51:01.310 --> 00:51:06.110]
You know, these people have feed their dogs. I mean, I mean, I mean, you know how much I love dogs. I'm a big dog lover.

[00:51:06.250 --> 00:51:10.910]
But people have feed their dogs like they cook up like a lamb, you know, and all this other gravy.

[00:51:11.670 --> 00:51:15.750]
Oh, oh, all this people food. And then their kids are eating like a gravy train, you know.

[00:51:16.150 --> 00:51:18.430]
Makes it sound gravy. Yeah, just that water.

[00:51:18.770 --> 00:51:22.550]
The federal government yesterday released new troubling details about manufacturing or testing.

[00:51:22.550 --> 00:51:28.850]
They said, prompted the recall of 60 million cans and pouches of potentially fatal pet food from store shelves throughout North America.

[00:51:29.230 --> 00:51:33.050]
I got a potentially fatal pouch and I better do something about it. Is it a pouch or a punch?

[00:51:34.750 --> 00:51:40.270]
The manufacturer on tario, Canada based menu foods. They've had a bit of been screaming about it here. A lot of screamers.

[00:51:41.170 --> 00:51:47.510]
Tasted its moist pet food beginning in late February feeding the product to 40 to 50 dogs and cats after a series of complaints from pet owners.

[00:51:48.050 --> 00:51:55.010]
Seven of those animals died. According to Steven Sunderloff, the FDA's tapetanurian, the mix of species was not immediately known.

[00:51:55.190 --> 00:52:01.850]
Sounds pretty species to me, huh? They tested it more spread food. Let's feed it to these dogs and see if they stay alive or croak, you know.

[00:52:02.090 --> 00:52:06.610]
And seven of them died. How come they didn't eat it? Menu foods, my ass.

[00:52:07.710 --> 00:52:10.410]
Those tests prompted a massive product we called the gun last Friday.

[00:52:10.530 --> 00:52:15.130]
A federal investigation is focusing on weak gluten, a common filler as a likely source of contamination.

[00:52:15.130 --> 00:52:19.370]
Weak gluten. Is that what they mean by gluten for punishment? I think so.

[00:52:20.330 --> 00:52:24.590]
The FDA has yet to tell how many reports it's received to cats and dogs suffering kidney failure or death.

[00:52:24.910 --> 00:52:30.810]
The company's reported 10 deaths, nine cats and a dog. Well, only one dog but nine cats. That's not too bad.

[00:52:31.450 --> 00:52:37.790]
Menu foods, manufacturers, and cells more than 50 North American brands, including IMs, America's choice, and Yukonuba.

[00:52:38.370 --> 00:52:39.110]
You can what?

[00:52:40.210 --> 00:52:45.970]
Yukonuba, if you try, the company became aware of a potential problem after receiving a number of older

[00:52:45.970 --> 00:52:51.430]
complaints that dogs and cats were vomiting and suffering kidney failure after you got to the pubic and their gut set.

[00:52:51.690 --> 00:52:53.970]
Well, Tide used to do that all the time just to piss me off, you know.

[00:52:55.110 --> 00:52:58.470]
They would start chewing up a bunch of garbage and crap on the carpet, you know.

[00:52:58.870 --> 00:53:02.470]
Any kind of mung-knows, and then they'd get all that lint in this throwy-dunk.

[00:53:03.650 --> 00:53:04.010]
Right.

[00:53:05.470 --> 00:53:10.270]
Oh, the food was sold under both store and major brand labels and Walmart, publics, windix, and other large retailers.

[00:53:10.770 --> 00:53:14.150]
Soundflow to pet stores, among those, to pull some fed-pood products.

[00:53:16.130 --> 00:53:20.070]
As a result of the recall, well, I'm a little tongue-tied here today. I don't know why I would do it.

[00:53:20.870 --> 00:53:24.890]
I think I feel like I'm on drugs. And this is a good way to do it because cheaply you don't do any.

[00:53:25.350 --> 00:53:27.170]
I feel like I'm on speed or something.

[00:53:27.770 --> 00:53:34.130]
A pet smarts store in Evan Turret took down some 120 items previously offered for sale, shoppers have been returning them for refunds.

[00:53:34.610 --> 00:53:37.010]
We want our money back, the dogs keeping his guts.

[00:53:38.190 --> 00:53:46.290]
Although many food cells, its food under numerous brands, the FDA's sundaugh noted that the company's recall effects only about 1% of the total pet food supply.

[00:53:46.930 --> 00:53:55.570]
The new recall covers the company's cuts and gravy-style food, which consists of chunks of meat and gravy sold in cans and four pouches from December 3rd to March 6th.

[00:53:57.090 --> 00:54:02.410]
We're still trying to find out what the true picture is out there of animals. It's really just impossible to extrapolate at this point.

[00:54:02.510 --> 00:54:04.390]
I don't think we can say extrapolate, can we?

[00:54:05.070 --> 00:54:05.150]
No.

[00:54:05.510 --> 00:54:13.150]
Other companies, Nestle Peer and the Pet Care Company, Procter and Gamble, the health pet nutritionist said that it's a precautionary recalling voluntarily some products made by many new foods.

[00:54:13.470 --> 00:54:19.190]
The many unanswered questions surrounding the product recalls led to palpable anxiety among pet owners during the past few days.

[00:54:19.770 --> 00:54:23.430]
Owners worry they may have poisoned, they may have poisoned, they beloved, campaigned unintentionally.

[00:54:24.570 --> 00:54:29.250]
Carrier Silver, receptionist at Alton Road Animal Hospital on Miami Beach, said the clinic got 30 phone calls.

[00:54:29.330 --> 00:54:30.190]
About 30 men!

[00:54:30.270 --> 00:54:34.910]
During eight hours it was open Sunday, one person said it all except for his kidney failure and what a note the food was to blame.

[00:54:35.270 --> 00:54:36.110]
And who to sue, I'm sure.

[00:54:36.950 --> 00:54:41.450]
Silver said people described symptoms and what are their drugs and cats diagnosed over the phone, which you can't be done.

[00:54:41.610 --> 00:54:45.990]
Hello, doctor, my dog, I've made his tail is hanging down, Tom Dooley.

[00:54:46.490 --> 00:54:52.850]
I think people are starting to get a little crazy but we can't make a proper analization without blood work silver said it's obviously something people care about.

[00:54:53.810 --> 00:55:05.970]
Although many foods designated two phone numbers that pet owners could call for information, 866 463 67 38 and 866 895 2708 many animal lovers said they couldn't get through.

[00:55:07.070 --> 00:55:08.130]
Should I give those numbers again?

[00:55:08.330 --> 00:55:08.870]
I in time.

[00:55:09.230 --> 00:55:09.630]
In time!

[00:55:09.890 --> 00:55:11.790]
Like Linda Blair said, I'll go and get around to it.

[00:55:11.790 --> 00:55:20.970]
Wheat gluten itself will not cause kidney failure leading up to investigate to suspect contamination by other substances including heavy metals like cadmium and letter of fungal toxins.

[00:55:21.690 --> 00:55:26.050]
Aflotoxin, a corn fungus sparked a 2005 dog food recall.

[00:55:26.510 --> 00:55:27.850]
There's a fungus among us.

[00:55:28.190 --> 00:55:29.410]
What is it?

[00:55:30.870 --> 00:55:31.470]
Aflotoxin.

[00:55:32.610 --> 00:55:36.950]
Many foods, folks, will mincerate tweets to the AP radio company who was still trying to finger it out.

[00:55:37.030 --> 00:55:38.070]
They're trying to finger it out.

[00:55:38.650 --> 00:55:42.490]
There's a fungus among you a study like that and George says you're right and I'm wrong.

[00:55:42.870 --> 00:55:44.850]
Whatever the subject is, you're right I'm wrong.

[00:55:45.030 --> 00:55:45.930]
Yeah, it's the most fun.

[00:55:46.110 --> 00:55:49.830]
After all these years I got one, one out of 17 years.

[00:55:51.270 --> 00:55:51.910]
And what then?

[00:55:52.050 --> 00:55:52.690]
Oh yeah.

[00:55:52.810 --> 00:55:54.490]
Local broads history should be fissures.

[00:55:54.950 --> 00:55:56.210]
Now you've got to find out what I can't say.

[00:55:56.210 --> 00:55:59.270]
So best talent for this is Neil Roger.

[00:55:59.450 --> 00:56:00.810]
Neil God.

[00:56:02.630 --> 00:56:05.090]
Bowling tomorrow on a radio.

[00:56:06.250 --> 00:56:07.470]
Badminton on Thursday.

[00:56:08.170 --> 00:56:10.270]
I'm gone, gone, gone, gone, gone.

[00:56:10.710 --> 00:56:13.710]
I just referee have again.

[00:56:14.250 --> 00:56:18.830]
You can't make me say, though I have a problem.

[00:56:19.790 --> 00:56:23.930]
I'm crazy, you think I drink too much.

[00:56:23.930 --> 00:56:29.850]
I party all night until I throw up.

[00:56:29.850 --> 00:56:35.010]
I smell more than my hair.

[00:56:35.450 --> 00:56:38.230]
Lost my sense of reality.

[00:56:38.890 --> 00:56:43.630]
I'm crazy, crazy just let me have again.

[00:56:44.550 --> 00:56:46.190]
I don't need their help.

[00:56:46.830 --> 00:56:48.650]
My name's not no hand.

[00:56:49.510 --> 00:56:53.370]
I'm crazy, crazy you think I have problems.

[00:56:53.370 --> 00:56:56.130]
More than just being dumb.

[00:56:57.830 --> 00:56:58.530]
I'm just being dumb.

[00:56:59.270 --> 00:57:03.950]
Just let me have again.

[00:57:04.190 --> 00:57:05.750]

[00:57:05.950 --> 00:57:07.270]
Missy Boyz got a problem.

[00:57:09.210 --> 00:57:13.310]
Crazy, crazy you think I have problems.

[00:57:14.230 --> 00:57:16.410]
More than just being dumb.

[00:57:18.250 --> 00:57:20.170]
It's called insanity.

[00:57:20.170 --> 00:57:22.610]
All morning long before the show, George is sitting there.

[00:57:24.390 --> 00:57:26.070]
George is the expert at North Carolina.

[00:57:26.330 --> 00:57:27.410]
George knows it all, baby.

[00:57:27.790 --> 00:57:29.050]
They found him alive.

[00:57:29.290 --> 00:57:29.850]
How do you like that?

[00:57:30.070 --> 00:57:30.230]
I don't know.

[00:57:30.470 --> 00:57:40.790]
They hit him with five shots and he's still alive.

[00:57:41.130 --> 00:57:42.250]
That's because he read that hatchet book.

[00:57:44.030 --> 00:57:44.950]
1050, what do we got?

[00:57:45.630 --> 00:57:46.770]
1062 votes now, man.

[00:57:46.890 --> 00:57:48.490]
It just changed right there in midstream like that.

[00:57:49.470 --> 00:57:49.950]
1062.

[00:57:51.110 --> 00:57:51.890]
WQAM, hello.

[00:57:54.430 --> 00:57:54.910]
QAM.

[00:57:57.550 --> 00:57:58.030]
Hello.

[00:57:58.770 --> 00:58:01.190]
That's a bunch of YRC's within anymore.

[00:58:01.590 --> 00:58:02.930]
I'm going to do it in five notes.

[00:58:04.790 --> 00:58:06.230]
That's a really changed.

[00:58:06.750 --> 00:58:08.190]
How peaceful, how do you feel?

[00:58:09.910 --> 00:58:11.170]
What was that?

[00:58:12.050 --> 00:58:12.990]
What was he listening to?

[00:58:13.190 --> 00:58:13.930]
Something like that, Clugman.

[00:58:14.530 --> 00:58:15.030]
It did it really?

[00:58:17.230 --> 00:58:21.130]
560, 0560, 0560, and he arrived in Singular wireless line.

[00:58:21.410 --> 00:58:22.230]
WQAM, hello.

[00:58:22.930 --> 00:58:23.530]
Hi Neil.

[00:58:24.050 --> 00:58:24.410]
Yes, sir.

[00:58:24.990 --> 00:58:25.390]
How you doing?

[00:58:25.930 --> 00:58:26.210]
Rob.

[00:58:26.890 --> 00:58:29.410]
Just to make a short story.

[00:58:30.790 --> 00:58:32.470]
I'm part in a gas pump.

[00:58:32.870 --> 00:58:34.370]
It's raining like hell down here.

[00:58:35.190 --> 00:58:36.650]
I'm part of the gas pump.

[00:58:37.030 --> 00:58:37.590]
I hear bang.

[00:58:38.530 --> 00:58:39.330]
Car hits me.

[00:58:39.430 --> 00:58:40.730]
Now, trust me.

[00:58:41.350 --> 00:58:42.270]
Okay, yeah, exactly.

[00:58:42.370 --> 00:58:42.670]
Thank you.

[00:58:43.070 --> 00:58:44.210]
So I go and round it back.

[00:58:44.310 --> 00:58:45.070]
My truck is looking.

[00:58:45.450 --> 00:58:49.350]
And guys, you know, he's getting out of the car and he says,

[00:58:49.490 --> 00:58:50.510]
oh, I couldn't see you.

[00:58:50.510 --> 00:58:51.350]
I couldn't see you now.

[00:58:51.430 --> 00:58:52.490]
My truck is a huge truck.

[00:58:53.650 --> 00:58:56.150]
Anyway, I says, well, you do some damage to your car.

[00:58:56.490 --> 00:58:58.550]
He gets out and he has sandals and white socks.

[00:58:58.870 --> 00:59:00.150]
Okay, I got to tell you something.

[00:59:01.170 --> 00:59:02.650]
So I helped him out.

[00:59:05.190 --> 00:59:10.470]
I said, well, you can probably get this car out of the salvage.

[00:59:11.250 --> 00:59:13.350]
I looked at the car and it was a Volvo.

[00:59:14.230 --> 00:59:16.030]
I said, well, you're going to be paying some bucks.

[00:59:16.930 --> 00:59:18.250]
He's disguised in tears.

[00:59:19.430 --> 00:59:20.890]
My wife's going to kill me.

[00:59:21.050 --> 00:59:21.610]
Oh, my God.

[00:59:21.750 --> 00:59:22.850]
My wife's going to kill me.

[00:59:23.090 --> 00:59:26.610]
And of course, on the front plate is Ontario.

[00:59:27.230 --> 00:59:28.010]
I'm out of Ontario.

[00:59:30.250 --> 00:59:31.710]
Well, it's because wife kills him.

[00:59:31.710 --> 00:59:34.050]
Yeah, all on the front plate is Ontario.

[00:59:34.130 --> 00:59:35.930]
All the bad drivers are from Canada.

[00:59:36.370 --> 00:59:36.890]
You see that?

[00:59:36.970 --> 00:59:37.950]
You've been talking about the frogs.

[00:59:37.950 --> 00:59:39.250]
That's how stupid this guy is.

[00:59:39.430 --> 00:59:39.490]
Okay?

[00:59:40.090 --> 00:59:44.010]
Yeah, all the bad, all the blue hair is all the people that are creating drive-thrues

[00:59:44.010 --> 00:59:45.250]
where there aren't any drive-thrues.

[00:59:45.650 --> 00:59:45.650]

[00:59:46.050 --> 00:59:47.990]
Yeah, that's all South Floridians, baby.

[00:59:48.190 --> 00:59:49.110]
But they're all in Ontario.

[00:59:49.490 --> 00:59:49.490]

[00:59:49.490 --> 00:59:50.590]
I'll take my chances here.

[00:59:50.670 --> 00:59:52.290]
In fact, I don't miss driving period.

[00:59:52.510 --> 00:59:55.190]
Look, it's like a contest to see who can be the worst driver down here.

[00:59:55.230 --> 00:59:55.390]
Yeah.

[00:59:55.850 --> 00:59:58.150]
Well, at least they're participating in it.

[00:59:59.130 --> 01:00:00.650]
On the front, my son played his on Terry.

[01:00:00.650 --> 01:00:01.950]
Notice how fake this story was.

[01:00:01.950 --> 01:00:05.170]
First it was this, and then it was the Volvo and something else.

[01:00:05.330 --> 01:00:05.670]
Schmuck.

[01:00:06.690 --> 01:00:08.470]
Yeah, that Canada really sucks, Near.

[01:00:08.530 --> 01:00:10.030]
You better get out of there while they're getting this good.

[01:00:10.130 --> 01:00:10.410]
Okay.

[01:00:11.550 --> 01:00:12.650]
W-Q-A-M, hello.

[01:00:13.630 --> 01:00:14.430]
I'm on my way.

[01:00:14.630 --> 01:00:15.270]
Q-A-M, hello.

[01:00:17.830 --> 01:00:19.130]
W-Q-A-M, hello.

[01:00:19.590 --> 01:00:21.730]
Yeah, hey, so I know you guys probably already know this.

[01:00:21.990 --> 01:00:25.090]
But did you guys know that the singer from Boston killed himself?

[01:00:25.470 --> 01:00:26.570]
Yeah, that's old news, man.

[01:00:27.010 --> 01:00:30.630]
Yeah, I knew I saw it.

[01:00:33.030 --> 01:00:34.570]
Hey, easy for you to laugh, man.

[01:00:34.710 --> 01:00:35.450]
Very funny, huh?

[01:00:35.890 --> 01:00:36.810]
Elvis dies in a crapper.

[01:00:36.870 --> 01:00:37.990]
This guy's laughing about it.

[01:00:38.350 --> 01:00:39.750]
That would be funny unless it was you.

[01:00:40.390 --> 01:00:42.070]
5-6-7, that's because I'm legendary.

[01:00:42.210 --> 01:00:42.790]
Damn, God!

[01:00:42.910 --> 01:00:43.910]
You can almost think about it.

[01:00:45.310 --> 01:00:50.110]
I really feel like we started yesterday and we kind of cut off into past like I was at birth.

[01:00:50.410 --> 01:00:51.730]
A little bit overdone if you asked me.

[01:00:52.170 --> 01:00:54.350]
But we started yesterday and then the ball game came along.

[01:00:54.470 --> 01:00:57.750]
But today, today we're putting this damn thing back on a map.

[01:00:58.010 --> 01:00:58.110]
Okay?

[01:00:58.110 --> 01:01:02.170]
In spite of Joe Bell, in spite of Clarence don't call me a Jack As Dero,

[01:01:03.190 --> 01:01:08.530]
in spite of all this other hazard riots going on, in spite of the square table and the oblong table and that crap.

[01:01:09.150 --> 01:01:10.390]
Jesus, got all mighty.

[01:01:11.370 --> 01:01:15.310]
That toast I guarantee if you check that out, he's still on the payroll across the street, he's got to be.

[01:01:16.810 --> 01:01:17.870]
W-Q-A-M, hello.

[01:01:18.270 --> 01:01:19.250]
In spite of you.

[01:01:19.710 --> 01:01:20.510]
Q-A-M.

[01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:20.510]

[01:01:20.930 --> 01:01:21.090]
Yeah.

[01:01:21.170 --> 01:01:21.330]
Hello.

[01:01:21.790 --> 01:01:22.530]
Yes, I am.

[01:01:22.870 --> 01:01:23.750]
Hey, how are you?

[01:01:23.750 --> 01:01:25.030]
Okay, sir.

[01:01:25.090 --> 01:01:25.770]
Thank you.

[01:01:25.930 --> 01:01:29.170]
Time to hand this was on the financial this morning.

[01:01:29.510 --> 01:01:30.510]
Yes, so who cares?

[01:01:31.070 --> 01:01:33.230]
Yeah, same old girl, same old girl.

[01:01:33.530 --> 01:01:36.390]
Hey, listen, what ever happened to those two pillars of the community?

[01:01:37.890 --> 01:01:39.090]
Three-well and spigot.

[01:01:39.310 --> 01:01:40.110]
Have you ever heard of them?

[01:01:40.390 --> 01:01:41.330]
W-Q-A-M, hello.

[01:01:42.330 --> 01:01:43.270]
Q-A-M, hello.

[01:01:44.290 --> 01:01:44.690]
What's up?

[01:01:46.330 --> 01:01:47.450]
W-Q-A-M, hello.

[01:01:47.450 --> 01:01:47.530]
What's up?

[01:01:47.670 --> 01:01:47.770]
W-Q-A-M, hello.

[01:01:47.970 --> 01:01:47.970]

[01:01:47.970 --> 01:01:48.530]
I'm a part of your missing.

[01:01:48.890 --> 01:01:49.470]
Q-A-M, hello.

[01:01:49.870 --> 01:01:51.310]
I'd you mean a bullet for court.

[01:01:52.070 --> 01:01:52.950]
W-Q-A-M, hello.

[01:01:53.370 --> 01:01:54.110]
Yeah, nailed.

[01:01:54.250 --> 01:01:54.450]
No, no.

[01:01:54.470 --> 01:01:55.210]
True story.

[01:01:55.330 --> 01:01:59.670]
I'm having dinner over there at Manero's stay-cow's before it shut down.

[01:01:59.810 --> 01:02:02.670]
And the jockey like Frankie Dittori.

[01:02:03.310 --> 01:02:04.170]
Yeah, I don't know if he...

[01:02:04.170 --> 01:02:05.370]
Did you get the Derby horse this year?

[01:02:06.550 --> 01:02:07.810]
How do I know if he's got the green horse?

[01:02:07.810 --> 01:02:08.190]
I'm not sure.

[01:02:08.330 --> 01:02:12.070]
But anyway, he's in there with his manager, Andy Rothman, and they're having...

[01:02:12.070 --> 01:02:13.450]
Greatest shock in the world, by the way.

[01:02:13.510 --> 01:02:15.470]
Oh, Andy Rothman is having dinner.

[01:02:15.990 --> 01:02:16.130]
Yeah.

[01:02:16.270 --> 01:02:19.990]
Andy Rothman and him are having dinner and Manero's stay-cow's.

[01:02:19.990 --> 01:02:23.530]
You always pick Frankie Dittori or whatever more he's on, you know?

[01:02:23.630 --> 01:02:23.790]
Yeah.

[01:02:24.250 --> 01:02:26.250]
So, let me ask you this question.

[01:02:26.610 --> 01:02:26.870]
Yeah.

[01:02:27.270 --> 01:02:28.130]
Who's Andy Rothman?

[01:02:28.610 --> 01:02:30.990]
He's a really good friend of mine who really...

[01:02:32.130 --> 01:02:33.590]
Obviously, really, really good.

[01:02:33.690 --> 01:02:34.010]
You're fair.

[01:02:34.070 --> 01:02:34.330]
Yeah.

[01:02:34.710 --> 01:02:38.470]
Probably not as good as you'd like him to be, but it sounds like a really, really good friend.

[01:02:38.690 --> 01:02:40.650]
Maybe that's why he knows David Sugarman and Steve Stone.

[01:02:42.810 --> 01:02:43.210]
Wow.

[01:02:43.790 --> 01:02:44.630]
You talk about...

[01:02:44.630 --> 01:02:47.650]
This guy's almost as good as the Harry Benson guy we had years ago.

[01:02:47.810 --> 01:02:48.710]
Talk about horse people.

[01:02:48.710 --> 01:02:49.670]
Of course I'll dance.

[01:02:50.430 --> 01:02:51.070]
Now, Franco...

[01:02:51.070 --> 01:02:52.410]
What is the name of Lion Franco?

[01:02:52.570 --> 01:02:54.030]
L.A. and Lion Franco Dittori.

[01:02:54.450 --> 01:02:55.070]
Frankie Dittori.

[01:02:55.390 --> 01:02:57.370]
It's had in Greatest Shock in the world, right?

[01:02:57.450 --> 01:02:58.490]
Mostly in England, as you know?

[01:02:58.770 --> 01:03:00.610]
And when he's over here in the big races, plunge your guts.

[01:03:00.910 --> 01:03:02.690]
Don't pay any attention to what the Huppert tells you.

[01:03:02.990 --> 01:03:03.170]
Okay?

[01:03:03.770 --> 01:03:05.290]
Plunge your guts on Frankie Dittori, man.

[01:03:05.350 --> 01:03:07.830]
When the money is down, he's going to be in town.

[01:03:08.310 --> 01:03:08.890]
Whatever that means.

[01:03:09.310 --> 01:03:09.950]
Oh, wait a minute.

[01:03:10.130 --> 01:03:10.930]
Chany is in the hospital.

[01:03:11.230 --> 01:03:11.970]
Oh, this is good news.

[01:03:12.410 --> 01:03:12.670]
Wait a minute.

[01:03:12.670 --> 01:03:15.230]
The vice president is over at George Washington University in the middle of the...

[01:03:15.230 --> 01:03:16.050]
Ah, just a check-out.

[01:03:16.130 --> 01:03:18.390]
Well, don't give us no false alarms, okay?

[01:03:18.390 --> 01:03:18.830]
On you.

[01:03:19.090 --> 01:03:20.450]
Jesus Christ Almighty.

[01:03:21.230 --> 01:03:22.610]
Chany is in the hospital, Virginia.

[01:03:22.830 --> 01:03:25.170]
They're checking to see if he's got any heart, which is highly unlikely.

[01:03:27.190 --> 01:03:28.830]
1075 votes on the poll today, I think.

[01:03:28.930 --> 01:03:31.490]
And you said, 1200, I'm going to say...

[01:03:32.530 --> 01:03:33.610]
We can do better than that.

[01:03:35.730 --> 01:03:37.810]
I mean, that's not exactly going out on a limb, you know?

[01:03:38.410 --> 01:03:38.590]
Chris.

[01:03:40.690 --> 01:03:42.750]
You see the already collapsed arm.

[01:03:43.490 --> 01:03:43.590]
Huh?

[01:03:44.190 --> 01:03:44.490]
I'm there.

[01:03:44.910 --> 01:03:45.690]
Collapse from hunger.

[01:03:46.610 --> 01:03:48.750]
Now, you guys don't have food come into the...

[01:03:48.750 --> 01:03:49.090]
Yeah, of course.

[01:03:49.090 --> 01:03:49.670]
We're in the highways.

[01:03:49.830 --> 01:03:50.390]
Thank you very much.

[01:03:50.730 --> 01:03:52.430]
Thank you, highways, for taking care of our people.

[01:03:52.590 --> 01:03:52.790]
They're okay.

[01:03:52.930 --> 01:03:55.470]
The White House is just a routine check-up to see if...

[01:03:55.470 --> 01:03:57.710]
First they're going to do the lobotomy to see if there's any brain in there.

[01:03:57.950 --> 01:03:58.870]
They're going to start looking in his...

[01:03:58.870 --> 01:03:59.410]
Right, go first.

[01:04:00.010 --> 01:04:01.750]
And then they're going to check to see if he's really all-heart.

[01:04:02.490 --> 01:04:04.630]
The worst evil doer on the face of their...

[01:04:04.630 --> 01:04:06.850]
He makes Hermann Garing look like a Sunday school teacher.

[01:04:07.190 --> 01:04:08.130]
That's what this guy does.

[01:04:08.250 --> 01:04:09.690]
Of course, beware of their Sunday school teacher.

[01:04:10.070 --> 01:04:11.070]
The biggest names.

[01:04:11.450 --> 01:04:12.490]
He can only say how he is.

[01:04:12.630 --> 01:04:12.650]
He can only say how he is.

[01:04:12.650 --> 01:04:13.830]
This is Neil Rogers.

[01:04:13.830 --> 01:04:15.550]
Don't run, Hillary.

[01:04:16.170 --> 01:04:17.870]
No, no, no.

[01:04:18.250 --> 01:04:19.370]
Don't run, Hillary.

[01:04:19.810 --> 01:04:22.630]
No, no, no, no.

[01:04:23.810 --> 01:04:24.650]
No, no, no.

[01:04:25.570 --> 01:04:27.310]
Hillary, Hillary.

[01:04:27.950 --> 01:04:28.130]
Hillary.

[01:04:28.130 --> 01:04:30.130]
You're the battle to replace.

[01:04:30.650 --> 01:04:32.150]
So massive, you may.

[01:04:32.590 --> 01:04:33.270]
Thank you.

[01:04:33.750 --> 01:04:37.730]
What's through the blow-in through your future in Hillary hole?

[01:04:39.330 --> 01:04:41.450]
Hillary, Hillary.

[01:04:41.450 --> 01:04:43.350]
You'll be the best class.

[01:04:43.890 --> 01:04:46.670]
Don't lie to me.

[01:04:47.790 --> 01:04:49.990]
You're a sliny, bit-chatter, dude.

[01:04:51.710 --> 01:04:53.010]
Don't run, Hillary.

[01:04:53.710 --> 01:04:55.310]
No, no, no.

[01:04:55.830 --> 01:04:56.930]
Don't run, Hillary.

[01:04:57.510 --> 01:05:00.710]
No, no, no, no.

[01:05:03.010 --> 01:05:04.990]
Hillary, Hillary.

[01:05:05.570 --> 01:05:10.950]
I should tell you that I can tell you who will cross the room.

[01:05:10.950 --> 01:05:15.470]
You're a no-bottess football swith or not a dude, or?

[01:05:17.310 --> 01:05:18.850]
Hillary, Hillary.

[01:05:19.450 --> 01:05:20.830]
My class.

[01:05:21.470 --> 01:05:24.670]
Don't lie to you.

[01:05:25.310 --> 01:05:27.630]
You're a common baby blue suits.

[01:05:29.070 --> 01:05:31.490]
You're a sliny, bit-chatter, dude.

[01:05:33.050 --> 01:05:34.830]
No, no, no, no, no.

[01:05:35.090 --> 01:05:35.970]
You.

[01:05:36.590 --> 01:05:38.810]
I see that ad was on NBC News last night.

[01:05:39.070 --> 01:05:40.550]
That's on the internet, making the rounds.

[01:05:40.550 --> 01:05:41.630]
Nobody knows who put it on.

[01:05:42.730 --> 01:05:46.770]
And supposedly it was the Barack Obama campaign behind it.

[01:05:46.830 --> 01:05:47.190]
No.

[01:05:47.670 --> 01:05:48.350]
Negative ad about her.

[01:05:48.430 --> 01:05:48.930]
You didn't see that?

[01:05:49.090 --> 01:05:49.250]
No.

[01:05:49.370 --> 01:05:51.510]
The comparator like to a Nazi bitch and stuff like this.

[01:05:51.810 --> 01:05:52.610]
And all these people are like,

[01:05:52.610 --> 01:05:56.750]
and the end is Barack Obama campaign.

[01:05:57.130 --> 01:05:58.130]
Which of course it's not.

[01:05:58.430 --> 01:06:00.070]
But that's the kind of crap that winds up on the internet.

[01:06:01.250 --> 01:06:02.530]
You wait and see, Mr.

[01:06:02.530 --> 01:06:03.530]
You might see nothing yet.

[01:06:03.610 --> 01:06:08.590]
You're going to see a political lynching that they're going to try and him like you have never dreamed in your wildest imagination.

[01:06:08.990 --> 01:06:09.230]
You'll see.

[01:06:09.870 --> 01:06:10.650]
Anyone in the why?

[01:06:10.850 --> 01:06:11.070]
Why?

[01:06:11.410 --> 01:06:12.510]
Because it's the American-F and wait.

[01:06:12.730 --> 01:06:16.810]
So this kid that you said is that he's alive, he's able to walk, he was found about a mile and a half from camp.

[01:06:17.210 --> 01:06:20.130]
Life goes on, CNN has spent hours and hours.

[01:06:20.430 --> 01:06:22.590]
There's 300 million people in the USA.

[01:06:24.370 --> 01:06:28.110]
And they just picked out this goofy kid with a red hair and a glasses and they said,

[01:06:28.110 --> 01:06:30.070]
well let's make a big difference about this.

[01:06:30.170 --> 01:06:30.310]
You know?

[01:06:32.410 --> 01:06:33.670]
1094 votes on the poll though.

[01:06:34.070 --> 01:06:34.430]
1094.

[01:06:34.730 --> 01:06:35.950]
I'm going for 13, man.

[01:06:36.070 --> 01:06:37.330]
I'm not settling for 1200 today.

[01:06:37.630 --> 01:06:38.230]
No way Jose.

[01:06:39.270 --> 01:06:40.930]
Because we got two and a half hours for Christ.

[01:06:41.070 --> 01:06:41.650]
Yes, do it!

[01:06:41.970 --> 01:06:43.350]
Yeah, we can do 1300 today.

[01:06:43.510 --> 01:06:43.690]
Chris.

[01:06:44.670 --> 01:06:45.730]
What are you going to say then?

[01:06:46.270 --> 01:06:46.850]
Let's say we can do it.

[01:06:48.030 --> 01:06:49.290]
1094 on there right now.

[01:06:49.630 --> 01:06:51.630]
And because it's, yeah, we do 1300 in this poll.

[01:06:51.770 --> 01:06:52.550]
It's not a bad poll.

[01:06:52.690 --> 01:06:53.850]
It's not a great poll.

[01:06:54.090 --> 01:06:55.190]
It's a poll.

[01:06:57.410 --> 01:07:00.930]
56670560, pound 560, we've arrived in Singular, wireless line.

[01:07:01.770 --> 01:07:02.510]
WQAM, hello.

[01:07:05.390 --> 01:07:05.830]
QAM.

[01:07:07.470 --> 01:07:08.850]
Sounds awfully dead to me, doesn't it?

[01:07:08.870 --> 01:07:09.590]
And this is the only one.

[01:07:09.870 --> 01:07:11.350]
This was the only one that was doing anything.

[01:07:11.810 --> 01:07:12.510]
WQAM, hello.

[01:07:13.350 --> 01:07:15.190]
Tell WQAM if they need a morning truck.

[01:07:15.350 --> 01:07:16.270]
I'm ready for it.

[01:07:16.510 --> 01:07:17.530]
I'm wild man, Jack.

[01:07:17.590 --> 01:07:17.910]
Wow!

[01:07:20.250 --> 01:07:21.530]
Oh, you're hired.

[01:07:22.550 --> 01:07:23.630]
Starts tomorrow morning.

[01:07:23.630 --> 01:07:25.450]
7 to 10 is the wild man, Jack.

[01:07:25.490 --> 01:07:26.230]
You're on QAM.

[01:07:26.810 --> 01:07:28.070]
Bring your own table, baby.

[01:07:31.390 --> 01:07:33.210]
56670560, I think they're out of material.

[01:07:33.990 --> 01:07:37.170]
But when the 20 minute delay catches up, then you'll see the phone's going to explode.

[01:07:37.670 --> 01:07:41.450]
Every now and then it just explodes kind of like a wireless spontaneous like that.

[01:07:43.010 --> 01:07:43.730]
WQAM, hello.

[01:07:45.330 --> 01:07:46.010]
I'm Neil.

[01:07:46.350 --> 01:07:46.970]
This is this.

[01:07:47.550 --> 01:07:48.270]
WQAM, hello.

[01:07:48.730 --> 01:07:50.030]
Good morning, Uncle Neil.

[01:07:50.370 --> 01:07:50.770]
Yes, sir.

[01:07:50.770 --> 01:07:52.510]
I'm your morning show start at 10.

[01:07:53.470 --> 01:07:53.810]
Yeah.

[01:07:54.310 --> 01:07:54.590]
Yeah.

[01:07:55.170 --> 01:07:56.310]
Hey, what's going on all that?

[01:07:56.330 --> 01:07:57.550]
Well, what does that mean?

[01:07:57.770 --> 01:07:58.870]
This is my morning show, sir.

[01:07:59.350 --> 01:07:59.470]
What?

[01:07:59.730 --> 01:08:07.250]
It means I've been listening for, you know, we'll go way back whatever from Miami, but I usually turn on the radio on QAM at 10AM.

[01:08:08.910 --> 01:08:10.130]
And then I go from there.

[01:08:10.250 --> 01:08:15.230]
I mean, and listen in and sometimes, you know, it's totally afternoon until dinner time, and I shut it off.

[01:08:15.810 --> 01:08:16.090]
Uh-huh.

[01:08:16.930 --> 01:08:18.630]
But, uh, yes, I have no idea.

[01:08:18.630 --> 01:08:21.530]
I would have to go to the end and then straight to bed is that it?

[01:08:21.530 --> 01:08:23.690]
And that dick, they would have all that, you know, yeah.

[01:08:24.010 --> 01:08:25.090]
Got to clear it out for them.

[01:08:25.150 --> 01:08:26.230]
Okay, anyway, moving along.

[01:08:26.850 --> 01:08:28.410]
And, uh, so what's going on?

[01:08:28.910 --> 01:08:32.950]
You got, I heard it up there for Canada to ship a lot of back food down here.

[01:08:33.370 --> 01:08:34.570]
I'm going to kill off the, uh, whole thing.

[01:08:34.570 --> 01:08:35.490]
Kill off the mercant animals.

[01:08:35.630 --> 01:08:36.890]
That's a new game plan.

[01:08:37.050 --> 01:08:37.650]
QAM, hello.

[01:08:38.330 --> 01:08:39.650]
Meet the horny.

[01:08:41.050 --> 01:08:41.690]
WQAM, hello.

[01:08:42.010 --> 01:08:44.350]
These colors have no originality, Neil.

[01:08:44.350 --> 01:08:45.410]
Yeah, just like you.

[01:08:45.550 --> 01:08:46.250]
QAM, hello.

[01:08:46.570 --> 01:08:46.950]
QAM.

[01:08:47.410 --> 01:08:47.810]
Yes.

[01:08:48.210 --> 01:08:49.270]
I'm a project writer.

[01:08:51.230 --> 01:08:51.930]
WQAM, hello.

[01:08:52.510 --> 01:08:52.950]
Hey, Neil.

[01:08:54.010 --> 01:08:54.690]
How are you?

[01:08:55.170 --> 01:08:55.390]
Okay.

[01:08:56.030 --> 01:08:57.790]
A mom away to America express.

[01:08:58.170 --> 01:08:58.670]
Thank you.

[01:08:59.090 --> 01:09:00.190]
Okay, good luck to you.

[01:09:00.290 --> 01:09:01.410]
Okay, get a platinum card, man.

[01:09:02.070 --> 01:09:03.190]
Get somebody's platinum card.

[01:09:03.270 --> 01:09:05.050]
Don't be messing around with a green card, the gold card.

[01:09:05.350 --> 01:09:05.950]
Go for the best.

[01:09:06.110 --> 01:09:06.650]
Go for the gold.

[01:09:06.950 --> 01:09:08.230]
I mean, go for the, uh, whatever it is.

[01:09:09.810 --> 01:09:10.510]
WQAM, hello.

[01:09:14.070 --> 01:09:14.510]
QAM.

[01:09:15.250 --> 01:09:16.010]
Neil, God.

[01:09:16.470 --> 01:09:16.850]
Yes, sir.

[01:09:17.330 --> 01:09:21.430]
Hey, I was calling about sure to pull about the Everglades in particular.

[01:09:22.350 --> 01:09:22.550]
Yeah.

[01:09:23.210 --> 01:09:24.370]
Everglades are pretty damn popular.

[01:09:24.870 --> 01:09:28.910]
We've got a local airline here, Jeff Blue, has the direct point for people we want to see

[01:09:28.910 --> 01:09:29.290]
it coming up.

[01:09:29.890 --> 01:09:31.590]
Oh, yeah.

[01:09:33.550 --> 01:09:35.390]
5670560 and 0560, the Verizon.

[01:09:35.730 --> 01:09:37.910]
What was value jet as what he was really thinking of, isn't it?

[01:09:38.450 --> 01:09:38.610]
Yeah.

[01:09:38.610 --> 01:09:38.910]
Yeah.

[01:09:39.190 --> 01:09:39.430]
Yeah.

[01:09:39.770 --> 01:09:40.730]
It comes up with jet blue.

[01:09:40.970 --> 01:09:44.610]
While you're close, pal, one word out of two ain't bad, but there you go.

[01:09:44.990 --> 01:09:47.910]
That's what happens when you're stuck down there for all your life, man.

[01:09:47.990 --> 01:09:48.990]
We never got to go anywhere.

[01:09:50.270 --> 01:09:52.030]
You want to go in a lot.

[01:09:52.490 --> 01:09:52.990]
I don't blame you.

[01:09:53.290 --> 01:09:54.850]
I would be doing that all day long.

[01:09:54.990 --> 01:09:55.150]
I'd be going,

[01:09:58.390 --> 01:09:58.750]
2470.

[01:09:58.970 --> 01:09:59.730]
Even my sleep, I'd be going,

[01:10:00.350 --> 01:10:00.950]
like that.

[01:10:01.230 --> 01:10:03.530]
Once in a while, maybe, hopefully, but I doubt it.

[01:10:04.070 --> 01:10:04.750]
WQAM, hello.

[01:10:05.570 --> 01:10:06.390]
Hi, my name is Hoya.

[01:10:06.790 --> 01:10:07.270]
Good, sir.

[01:10:07.750 --> 01:10:12.050]
Uh, was it the cops and you said this morning about pound away?

[01:10:12.450 --> 01:10:12.790]
Yeah.

[01:10:13.390 --> 01:10:15.030]
Yeah, I believe it or not.

[01:10:15.150 --> 01:10:18.710]
Yeah, I caught part of that crazy nation anyway.

[01:10:18.990 --> 01:10:23.450]
Uh, we were not married as being out on there this morning with him and tore him a new one.

[01:10:23.730 --> 01:10:23.910]
Yeah.

[01:10:23.990 --> 01:10:27.290]
We asked him, uh, 70% of the American public voted.

[01:10:27.390 --> 01:10:28.510]
Well, let me ask you this question.

[01:10:28.670 --> 01:10:30.250]
What do they put him on there for in the first place?

[01:10:30.370 --> 01:10:31.050]
That's the question.

[01:10:31.110 --> 01:10:32.170]
Now whether he tore up in the West.

[01:10:32.170 --> 01:10:35.770]
Let me and you and the rest of it, you know, not these, uh, you know, marching down the street.

[01:10:35.770 --> 01:10:36.310]
Yeah, good point.

[01:10:36.430 --> 01:10:36.630]
Okay.

[01:10:38.650 --> 01:10:42.070]
560560, pound 560 in the Verizon and singular wireless line.

[01:10:42.250 --> 01:10:50.350]
I know if I want to get my political affix for the day, I always tune in the today show and watch Maradith Viera really grill those guys, grill all those crooks.

[01:10:50.470 --> 01:10:50.670]
Don't you?

[01:10:51.510 --> 01:10:52.250]
Oh, yeah, all day.

[01:10:52.510 --> 01:10:54.590]
1103 on the pole, by the way, 1103.

[01:10:54.770 --> 01:10:55.530]
Chris said 1200.

[01:10:55.530 --> 01:10:56.970]
I'm saying 13, man.

[01:10:57.210 --> 01:10:58.970]
We won't settle for less than 13 today.

[01:10:58.970 --> 01:11:02.150]
And if we get 1300 votes, we're going to party right here on the air.

[01:11:02.290 --> 01:11:05.670]
You'll see everybody gets a free party in their pants.

[01:11:07.710 --> 01:11:08.190]
WDQAM.

[01:11:08.310 --> 01:11:08.470]
Hello.

[01:11:09.350 --> 01:11:10.030]
Hey, Neil.

[01:11:10.430 --> 01:11:10.790]
Yes, sir.

[01:11:11.490 --> 01:11:15.470]
Hey, I'm driving down 95 C. Waterdale in a monsoon.

[01:11:16.370 --> 01:11:16.690]
Yeah.

[01:11:17.050 --> 01:11:21.250]
And my wife calls me and starts freaking out and talking about poison, cat food.

[01:11:22.110 --> 01:11:26.310]
I don't know if you're thinking about it or standing about it.

[01:11:26.310 --> 01:11:28.310]
Never heard anything about it.

[01:11:29.130 --> 01:11:33.210]
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

[01:11:33.210 --> 01:11:34.470]
Tell her, don't eat too much of it.

[01:11:34.550 --> 01:11:36.370]
Okay, that's the best, that'd be the best line.

[01:11:37.070 --> 01:11:39.050]
Don't just taste a little bit first to make sure.

[01:11:39.470 --> 01:11:41.790]
And then if you pass out, call me back or not.

[01:11:43.730 --> 01:11:45.370]
Jesus, God almighty, man.

[01:11:45.450 --> 01:11:47.670]
It's just to talk about, I'm supposed to be out of touch.

[01:11:48.350 --> 01:11:48.910]
Touch this.

[01:11:49.510 --> 01:11:51.970]
Well, there's that guy's the kids father we're going to keep showing him.

[01:11:51.970 --> 01:11:53.470]
He's a big TV star now.

[01:11:53.670 --> 01:11:53.890]
Right.

[01:11:54.310 --> 01:11:57.850]
The voice guy kid that's alive and able to walk my own stories over.

[01:11:58.810 --> 01:11:59.570]
Yeah, that's right.

[01:11:59.690 --> 01:12:01.130]
Times up, times up pops.

[01:12:01.350 --> 01:12:02.990]
Oh no, they're just getting started with him now.

[01:12:03.030 --> 01:12:06.430]
About the fact that Michael the bass can't wait for the movie.

[01:12:06.970 --> 01:12:07.370]
Yeah.

[01:12:07.630 --> 01:12:08.790]
How come he let him loose?

[01:12:08.930 --> 01:12:09.990]
How come he let this kid loose?

[01:12:10.190 --> 01:12:12.770]
He's got what does he guys dyslexic or something like an ADD?

[01:12:13.190 --> 01:12:13.750]
Oh, ADD.

[01:12:13.790 --> 01:12:14.330]
He's got attention.

[01:12:14.630 --> 01:12:16.290]
He can add, but he can't multiply.

[01:12:16.650 --> 01:12:17.110]
Thank God.

[01:12:18.470 --> 01:12:19.710]
1114 votes on the pool.

[01:12:20.250 --> 01:12:20.850]
And look who's Lee.

[01:12:20.850 --> 01:12:21.710]
Looky, looky, looky.

[01:12:21.810 --> 01:12:25.890]
If someone from out of town visits South Florida, make sure they don't miss the legendary

[01:12:25.890 --> 01:12:26.910]
near Roger show.

[01:12:26.970 --> 01:12:27.650]
They're all gone.

[01:12:27.850 --> 01:12:28.310]
He had a 21.

[01:12:28.750 --> 01:12:29.770]
Boy, man.

[01:12:30.510 --> 01:12:32.210]
I'm hanging out of the chair with both hands.

[01:12:33.010 --> 01:12:34.670]
I would advise them not to come to 97.

[01:12:35.250 --> 01:12:36.490]
South Beach 225.

[01:12:36.790 --> 01:12:37.790]
I hate this pool 61.

[01:12:38.010 --> 01:12:39.530]
Only 5.4% they like it.

[01:12:40.570 --> 01:12:43.170]
In fact, when we start to pull every day, we should ask, do you like it?

[01:12:44.590 --> 01:12:47.470]
Sog, Rasmills, mall 36, and little Savannah.

[01:12:47.830 --> 01:12:49.030]
Look how many little vans got.

[01:12:49.110 --> 01:12:50.050]
About 30, man.

[01:12:50.050 --> 01:12:52.630]
Yeah, don't miss your outbound flight 29.

[01:12:52.850 --> 01:12:56.990]
The early bird winner 23, the Jungle Queen, dinner crews 23.

[01:12:57.670 --> 01:12:58.930]
Don't miss the Jungle Queen.

[01:12:59.590 --> 01:13:01.030]
The Micahe 21.

[01:13:01.770 --> 01:13:03.590]
Have 20 or 30, then Polynesian drinks.

[01:13:04.490 --> 01:13:05.750]
Semitri Village 20.

[01:13:05.910 --> 01:13:09.770]
The Metro Zoo 16 with the anxious Ron McGill who Chris hates like poison.

[01:13:10.550 --> 01:13:13.390]
Monkey Jungle 11 and the Parrot Jungle is for the birds.

[01:13:13.770 --> 01:13:14.530]
So lamentate uno.

[01:13:14.890 --> 01:13:15.990]
The biggest name.

[01:13:16.270 --> 01:13:17.490]
So only one girl likes it.

[01:13:17.490 --> 01:13:18.890]
This is real Roger.

[01:13:19.290 --> 01:13:20.550]
In a birthday card?

[01:13:20.790 --> 01:13:22.010]
Well, it'll make breaking up cards.

[01:13:22.270 --> 01:13:22.690]
You're fire.

[01:13:22.930 --> 01:13:23.970]
That's your all.

[01:13:24.450 --> 01:13:26.230]
You are show going to be sick.

[01:13:26.410 --> 01:13:27.730]
You're just having a bad day.

[01:13:27.910 --> 01:13:29.110]
I've had a bad day.

[01:13:29.470 --> 01:13:31.530]
So squat on this, you made it.

[01:13:31.810 --> 01:13:33.510]
Because you had a bad day.

[01:13:33.950 --> 01:13:35.230]
And then you walked down.

[01:13:35.790 --> 01:13:38.550]
And the sun told us to turn it around.

[01:13:39.010 --> 01:13:42.150]
And then you thought, oh, tell me so much.

[01:13:42.550 --> 01:13:45.310]
You were not as fine as you go on a run.

[01:13:46.990 --> 01:13:48.170]
Yes, he's been fired.

[01:13:48.530 --> 01:13:49.130]
You're fired.

[01:13:49.470 --> 01:13:51.030]
You get to pack those things and go.

[01:13:51.250 --> 01:13:53.890]
Now that's when I call a bad day.

[01:13:54.170 --> 01:13:55.670]
Alright, look, I've got an angle.

[01:13:56.070 --> 01:13:56.650]
Who knows what happened?

[01:13:56.990 --> 01:13:58.870]
He lost his generals in the fire.

[01:13:59.250 --> 01:14:00.810]
He's just been arrested.

[01:14:01.110 --> 01:14:02.430]
We've lost our mojo.

[01:14:02.710 --> 01:14:03.930]
I think I'm going to be sick.

[01:14:04.190 --> 01:14:04.650]
You're fired.

[01:14:04.910 --> 01:14:06.110]
I think I've won gold man.

[01:14:06.430 --> 01:14:07.730]
You're the best day.

[01:14:08.230 --> 01:14:09.430]
You're the best of life.

[01:14:09.910 --> 01:14:11.170]
You're the best now.

[01:14:11.170 --> 01:14:11.210]
You're the best now.

[01:14:13.490 --> 01:14:15.350]
You're the best now.

[01:14:16.470 --> 01:14:18.110]
You're the best now.

[01:14:18.270 --> 01:14:21.810]
I saw this drunk guy throw up.

[01:14:22.030 --> 01:14:23.090]
And then a pigeon ate it.

[01:14:23.210 --> 01:14:23.510]
He forgot.

[01:14:23.850 --> 01:14:25.170]
He cheated on me.

[01:14:25.290 --> 01:14:25.830]
I got kicked out.

[01:14:25.950 --> 01:14:27.010]
She dumped me and broke my heart.

[01:14:27.130 --> 01:14:27.790]
You broke your pills.

[01:14:28.150 --> 01:14:30.630]
I paid by Agra just not to wet my shoes.

[01:14:33.210 --> 01:14:34.410]
11.29 in the fall.

[01:14:34.590 --> 01:14:35.510]
11.45 in the clock.

[01:14:35.510 --> 01:14:36.190]
How do you like that?

[01:14:36.410 --> 01:14:36.810]
Tick-tock.

[01:14:36.950 --> 01:14:38.130]
It's 11.45 in the clock.

[01:14:38.310 --> 01:14:38.950]
It's almost noon.

[01:14:39.030 --> 01:14:39.930]
And we'll be on here by two.

[01:14:40.370 --> 01:14:41.790]
Not that I'm counting you understand.

[01:14:42.170 --> 01:14:42.170]

[01:14:42.610 --> 01:14:43.950]
Through to the ball games.

[01:14:43.950 --> 01:14:45.190]
Through to the Marlins, we know.

[01:14:45.470 --> 01:14:46.050]
The Marlins.

[01:14:46.290 --> 01:14:48.170]
The Marlins.

[01:14:48.370 --> 01:14:49.830]
The Cardinals, it's 12.50 on Thursday.

[01:14:51.090 --> 01:14:51.810]
My mind.

[01:14:52.890 --> 01:14:55.090]
Here's a nice pool suggestion from our friends at university

[01:14:55.090 --> 01:14:56.750]
who don't do any work down there at all.

[01:14:57.890 --> 01:14:59.130]
I like this pool suggestion.

[01:14:59.310 --> 01:15:00.870]
If I could be somebody else for one day,

[01:15:00.990 --> 01:15:01.810]
we never did this before.

[01:15:02.270 --> 01:15:04.870]
I did a similar one where if you could trade lives with someone

[01:15:04.870 --> 01:15:05.790]
but like permanently.

[01:15:06.030 --> 01:15:06.610]
This is a good one.

[01:15:06.930 --> 01:15:08.650]
If I could be somebody for just one day.

[01:15:08.650 --> 01:15:14.290]
Right I would be I'd be Bill Jace cuz then I read the bell like a whole bunch of checks to myself on the next day

[01:15:14.290 --> 01:15:17.230]
Go back to be me. Yeah very good next day. Go back to being like

[01:15:17.830 --> 01:15:21.490]
Pretty queen I go back to being Brady Quinn. Mm-hmm

[01:15:21.490 --> 01:15:25.310]
I'll tell you one thing if I was Brady Quinn for a day. I'd be real busy. I'll take it that

[01:15:26.050 --> 01:15:28.670]
My my my look out now. I'd be real busy

[01:15:28.670 --> 01:15:34.470]
And look at this George W. Bush look at the names they have on here. You want to be George W. Bush for one day?

[01:15:35.130 --> 01:15:35.450]
God

[01:15:35.450 --> 01:15:40.150]
You Bill Clinton swore to be Clinton Wayne Heizinga, you know, wow

[01:15:40.150 --> 01:15:44.670]
That'll change your complexion. I guess Tiger Woods that would also probably change most of your complexion

[01:15:44.670 --> 01:15:47.830]
Well, that sounded like a racial comment to me. Let's get your rose on it

[01:15:48.370 --> 01:15:56.270]
Hugh Hefner Neil Rogers. Oh, yeah, oh good Howard sperm anybody who but who I am I then that's certainly in South Florida

[01:15:56.270 --> 01:15:59.810]
That would definitely go for big when we did this pull I gotta be me

[01:16:01.970 --> 01:16:02.330]
I

[01:16:02.330 --> 01:16:07.750]
Gotta be me alright. That's great. I can hear Sammy Davis singing that who's things are gotta be me? I don't know

[01:16:08.410 --> 01:16:14.330]
You got it. I'll see now you got you got the songs out of the guys really by artist all of the above

[01:16:14.330 --> 01:16:17.430]
I see and I hate this pool. Yeah, it's not a bad one

[01:16:17.890 --> 01:16:20.410]
Now you think I'd give the phone numbers again on the dog food thing

[01:16:20.410 --> 01:16:24.270]
Because you know very seriously we have a lot of dual lovers out there and the fact the word dog lovers

[01:16:24.770 --> 01:16:29.870]
If there's menu foods is got two phone numbers that pet owners could call for information before you go poisoning your dog

[01:16:29.870 --> 01:16:32.490]
Your cat. I go ahead give it a shot. You don't put your dog

[01:16:33.790 --> 01:16:34.190]
866

[01:16:36.150 --> 01:16:37.110]
And by the way something

[01:16:37.110 --> 01:16:39.690]
You were right first time

[01:16:40.210 --> 01:16:40.610]
Sammy

[01:16:42.530 --> 01:16:42.930]
Sammy

[01:16:44.070 --> 01:16:44.470]
Sammy

[01:16:44.470 --> 01:16:44.470]

[01:16:46.230 --> 01:16:48.330]
Riders are gonna be the Sammy Davis to do

[01:16:48.330 --> 01:16:51.290]
I'm a place in this world

[01:16:51.290 --> 01:16:57.110]
Yeah, I heard ladies that only one who I gotta be me okay

[01:16:57.110 --> 01:16:59.050]
I did a full set of things on

[01:16:59.830 --> 01:17:03.410]
Pedowners can call for information before you go positive poisoning your dog 866

[01:17:04.590 --> 01:17:05.070]
463

[01:17:06.390 --> 01:17:07.350]
6738 or

[01:17:08.050 --> 01:17:08.530]
866

[01:17:09.430 --> 01:17:09.910]
895

[01:17:10.930 --> 01:17:15.450]
2708 now a lot of people say they can't get through because obviously they're getting Zidians it calls from people are in a panic

[01:17:16.190 --> 01:17:21.550]
About the Yukonuba and I'm and a lot of these other dog foods and of course it's a Canadian plot probably from that fascist

[01:17:21.550 --> 01:17:27.290]
Steven Harper who wants to be bush light, you know, not a bastard Canadian Prime Minister Steven Harper

[01:17:30.510 --> 01:17:31.390]
866 463

[01:17:32.150 --> 01:17:35.250]
6738 or 866 895

[01:17:35.730 --> 01:17:39.050]
27 wait I'll give him a little reminder remind me to a do that okay to do that

[01:17:39.050 --> 01:17:42.890]
Hey, don't forget now this drive our joy Porter Chris is this old noses or something

[01:17:42.890 --> 01:17:46.590]
I should mention by Alice Marvez you think it was by Alice Marvez we know about it

[01:17:46.590 --> 01:17:47.730]
I believe it was like two days ago

[01:17:48.290 --> 01:17:51.190]
So I shouldn't bother with it. It's just a lot of men have been yesterday. I know it

[01:17:51.190 --> 01:17:54.510]
I thought ESPN yesterday after me recently signed off the linebacker

[01:17:54.510 --> 01:17:58.630]
Joy Porter didn't need long to live up to his reputation as one of the NFL's most controversial players

[01:17:58.630 --> 01:18:05.270]
It says he was set it for misderminer battery Sunday night after allegedly punching another NFL player in the face at a Vegas casino

[01:18:05.270 --> 01:18:07.670]
Anya used to go to Vegas a lot. Oh no

[01:18:08.250 --> 01:18:12.150]
Porter had a brief altercation with Cincinnati Bengals left tackle Levi Jones

[01:18:12.150 --> 01:18:19.410]
Oh Levi is coming there's at the Eli is coming. He'll be dog night. Eli. How about Levi Harner? He's been dead. How many years?

[01:18:20.250 --> 01:18:25.950]
Well the gaming table that palms casino Vegas police department spokesman Martin Wright said right said Jones who chose to price charges

[01:18:25.950 --> 01:18:31.990]
Received on-site medical treatment for a small cut Jones also claimed several of his gold chains were stolen during the melee

[01:18:32.690 --> 01:18:38.070]
A source said the six five three hundred and seven pound Jones is telling those close to him that he was jumped at the table by six

[01:18:38.070 --> 01:18:42.310]
other people over with Porter the source said Jones is claiming was hitting the back of the head by one of Porter's

[01:18:42.310 --> 01:18:46.830]
Associates just before being punched in the push by the six three two hundred and fifty pound linebacker

[01:18:46.830 --> 01:18:49.870]
Boys let me boys, you know it boys let me boys

[01:18:49.870 --> 01:18:54.650]
and take showers naked together and snap each other on the ass with towels stuff like that

[01:18:55.050 --> 01:18:56.410]
Like a bunch of overgrown chilling

[01:18:57.270 --> 01:18:58.670]
1136 votes on the polo

[01:18:59.370 --> 01:19:01.510]
You have any doubt will get to 13 every day. I don't

[01:19:02.570 --> 01:19:07.570]
Confidence is confidence is running pretty high now. That's high as you are but confidence is high. I wish

[01:19:08.490 --> 01:19:11.150]
Now what is the story from La Paz Bolivia La Paz

[01:19:12.470 --> 01:19:17.850]
I don't know how you use it. I think it was like a speech. You can't lie. I don't know how they talk in Bolivia is it all?

[01:19:17.950 --> 01:19:24.570]
Look a brassy I think that's pretty outrageous that way after all these years we've been calling to look a bratsy and

[01:19:24.570 --> 01:19:27.290]
And we're wrong. Yeah, go. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah

[01:19:27.290 --> 01:19:34.450]
I am Marlon and grateful that you have invited me to your daughter's wedding

[01:19:34.450 --> 01:19:36.170]
ha ha ha ha ha

[01:19:36.170 --> 01:19:37.450]
He's a very scary guy

[01:19:38.750 --> 01:19:43.350]
The farmers and women it says always Coca Cola out of Bolivia's Coca growers have their way

[01:19:43.890 --> 01:19:48.390]
The farmers want the word coka drop by the u.s. software and company arguing that the potent shrub

[01:19:48.390 --> 01:19:50.130]
belongs to the cultural heritage of this

[01:19:50.130 --> 01:19:50.870]
Andean nation

[01:19:50.870 --> 01:19:53.910]
Bolivia or the coke relief in poses in India life

[01:19:53.910 --> 01:19:56.130]
I got Andean music

[01:19:57.350 --> 01:20:01.030]
Or the coke relief in fuses every day life and is sacred to many

[01:20:01.570 --> 01:20:03.290]
That's Andean music the choice

[01:20:03.290 --> 01:20:09.850]
is. I see. Play by Andy. How about Amos and Andy music? A commission of

[01:20:09.850 --> 01:20:12.710]
Koch industry representatives advising an assembly regarding Bolivia's

[01:20:12.710 --> 01:20:16.310]
constitution past a resolution last week calling on the Atlanta based

[01:20:16.310 --> 01:20:19.910]
company to take Koko out of its name asking the UN to decriminalize the

[01:20:19.910 --> 01:20:25.870]
leaf. Go leaf go. The resolution demands international companies that

[01:20:25.870 --> 01:20:28.770]
include in their commercial name the name of Koko refrain from using the name

[01:20:28.770 --> 01:20:32.770]
of their sacred leaf in their products. Yes, how about just Khoa? Would you

[01:20:32.770 --> 01:20:37.930]
care for a Kola? Well, I don't like that coke. Kola anyway. So they can

[01:20:37.930 --> 01:20:41.190]
call it whatever they want. How about they call it Kaka Cola? Yeah, how about the

[01:20:41.190 --> 01:20:45.070]
uncool? See Pepsi Cola works fine with me and they're not upset about that.

[01:20:45.250 --> 01:20:49.550]
That's a lot of my drink in here. Oh, I'm drinking a diet coke with caffeine.

[01:20:52.010 --> 01:20:55.930]
That explains why I'm so hopped up today like a Mexican jumping bee. The

[01:20:55.930 --> 01:20:59.450]
commission which met for three days in super 250-fire miles southeast of La

[01:20:59.450 --> 01:21:03.450]
Paz is part of an effort led by President Ivo Morales to rehabilitate the

[01:21:03.450 --> 01:21:07.390]
image of the plant used in the Andean and these for millennia but better known

[01:21:07.390 --> 01:21:12.430]
as the basing wheel you know cocaine. We better send our fat ass governor's

[01:21:12.430 --> 01:21:17.130]
daughter to check it out. I'll go with it. Koko Cola stated last week its

[01:21:17.130 --> 01:21:21.210]
trademark is the most valuable and recognized brand in the world baby and is

[01:21:21.210 --> 01:21:26.810]
protected under Bolivian law. Don't be messing with our Koka baby. The statement

[01:21:26.810 --> 01:21:29.970]
repeated the company's past and I was that Koka Cola's ever used cocaine is

[01:21:29.970 --> 01:21:33.690]
an ingredient but with sound and I wasn't a natural coca leaf was used to flavor

[01:21:33.690 --> 01:21:38.690]
the soda. They need to understand our situation said David Herrera, a state

[01:21:38.690 --> 01:21:42.950]
government supervisor for the Koka rich Chapade region. They exported Koka's

[01:21:42.950 --> 01:21:47.110]
raw material for Koka Cola and we can't even freely sell it in Bolivia. Who now

[01:21:47.110 --> 01:21:50.990]
wants a living Bolivia anyway? The Bolivian government regulates the sale of

[01:21:50.990 --> 01:21:54.090]
cocaine and prevent use by the drug trade and its natural state degree leave is

[01:21:54.090 --> 01:22:00.610]
only a mild stimulant. Let me see I got I got it in here. What's that? Malta

[01:22:01.370 --> 01:22:11.070]
stimulant? In my plans. In Bolivia. In Bolivia. I only wish to put

[01:22:11.070 --> 01:22:17.130]
a pledge. I only wish. In Bolivia's white

[01:22:17.130 --> 01:22:20.310]
color office is Koka T. you're certain instead of coffee. I have a piece of advice

[01:22:20.310 --> 01:22:23.550]
for all you young punks under 100 out there. Don't get old okay. That's my

[01:22:23.550 --> 01:22:29.050]
piece of advice. Don't ever get old. Oh it's so it'll happen to you. Oh no. Huh? Yeah

[01:22:29.050 --> 01:22:34.490]
exactly. In Bolivia's white color orifices Koka T. is served instead of coffee

[01:22:34.490 --> 01:22:37.670]
and the country's farmers, miners and truckers chew believe to get through the

[01:22:37.670 --> 01:22:40.730]
long work days. That's what we do with two aim is not what they do in the sales

[01:22:40.730 --> 01:22:45.210]
department. They chew on coca leaves. I don't think so. Not those leaves. They're

[01:22:45.210 --> 01:22:48.490]
chewing on something. The government wants to you enter the criminalized trade

[01:22:48.490 --> 01:22:52.250]
and coca based products to promote its exports. Moralesay former Koka grower

[01:22:52.250 --> 01:22:56.290]
thinks an international market for a Koka to ride products such as tea, flour,

[01:22:56.830 --> 01:23:00.190]
liquor even toothpaste would draw some of the companies and watch out what kind of

[01:23:00.190 --> 01:23:03.150]
toothpaste you use in baby. I should. I should. I should. I should. I should. Would

[01:23:03.150 --> 01:23:06.990]
draw some of the companies estimated 65,500 acres of cocoa away from the drug

[01:23:06.990 --> 01:23:11.210]
trade but the US which finds which funds Bolivia and Koka eradication program is

[01:23:11.970 --> 01:23:15.550]
adamantly opposed to such proposals continue to encourage more cocoa

[01:23:15.550 --> 01:23:20.810]
production. I'm sure you don't want to have that happen doing. No yeah that would

[01:23:20.810 --> 01:23:26.130]
be better. Things go better with cocoa baby. 1145 on a poll we got 13 hundred

[01:23:26.130 --> 01:23:30.710]
of it easy today. It's fight about crowd fat Chris's a salami. Cracked through a

[01:23:31.290 --> 01:23:37.750]
frist. Somebody. Somebody you can do I am hello. Hey God. Yes sir. I was just

[01:23:37.750 --> 01:23:41.870]
what I want to tell you that there I went to Bolivia one time and because of the

[01:23:41.870 --> 01:23:46.610]
altitude you get real bad headaches. Yeah and they gave you this tea that takes

[01:23:46.610 --> 01:23:50.270]
it away and I didn't find out so later that the tea contained the coca leaves

[01:23:50.270 --> 01:23:54.970]
and it makes you feel real good afterwards. I mean it was it wasn't it wasn't it

[01:23:54.970 --> 01:23:58.750]
was drinking it or snorting it. No you're drinking it just opened up your blood

[01:23:58.750 --> 01:24:02.250]
vessels and you're drinking it makes you you know release those headaches but

[01:24:02.250 --> 01:24:07.790]
hey one other question for for George there for once a year. I'm going to go to

[01:24:07.790 --> 01:24:13.270]
China in November and I'm taking up my trip in Beijing and I'm thinking of going

[01:24:13.270 --> 01:24:16.710]
to another country but since Beijing is so far north I wanted to get the

[01:24:16.710 --> 01:24:21.050]
colors and your opinion of you know where where I'm supposed to go maybe Tokyo or

[01:24:21.050 --> 01:24:27.690]
something. Okay yeah go to Japan instead of China. I'm asking George this I just had a

[01:24:27.690 --> 01:24:31.290]
friend that came back from China. Oh I'm okay. Okay anyway something

[01:24:31.290 --> 01:24:39.690]
guys later. Hey George yeah go Cooper. Okay see this is all inside. Apparently

[01:24:39.690 --> 01:24:42.590]
yeah I'm just yeah I'm just going to China and I don't care what my friend says

[01:24:42.590 --> 01:24:50.750]
about how fun it was in China. Don't go there. Yeah it's the Mexico of Asia. Really?

[01:24:52.270 --> 01:24:58.450]
It's it's the in Japan they use the Chinese illegal aliens to do their cheap labor

[01:24:58.450 --> 01:25:04.190]
the way that we do with the Mexicans over here. I see. So what does that mean?

[01:25:04.490 --> 01:25:10.070]
Don't go to China. And what about Japan? Go to Japan. Now would you rather be learning Japanese or

[01:25:10.070 --> 01:25:15.790]
turning Japanese? 152 votes on the pool. 1152 if someone from out of town visits

[01:25:15.790 --> 01:25:19.710]
South Florida make sure they don't miss the near Roger show. He's legendary man he's a

[01:25:19.710 --> 01:25:24.190]
fat old fag and he's a real hoot. That's right. You're gonna see I just I just want to give

[01:25:24.190 --> 01:25:28.890]
people a little uh that's my goal now the rest of the time I'm on here. We're not gonna save the

[01:25:28.890 --> 01:25:33.050]
world from George Bush or any of the other Nazis out there. Just a little chuckle every now and then

[01:25:33.050 --> 01:25:39.070]
like that. That's all we can do man. That's a public service and the price is right. I would advise

[01:25:39.070 --> 01:25:43.170]
them not to come 304 that was my vote. Don't go to South Florida you'll regret it and you may

[01:25:43.170 --> 01:25:49.990]

Monkey Jungle 11 in the Parachungal finally got another vote. Solar Mente Doce for the Parachungal.

[01:26:24.430 --> 01:26:28.710]
You know what I think are really neat birds are my cause. You ever see my cause? Sure just

[01:26:28.710 --> 01:26:32.430]
recently. So I was going back in the day when the Parachungal was in the original location. I

[01:26:32.430 --> 01:26:36.050]
think I was there a couple of times and then that's just parrots but all these other talking birds

[01:26:36.050 --> 01:26:42.290]
you know right McCaw their expensive. Are they really? They are. Oh good let's go a long time.

[01:26:42.730 --> 01:26:50.110]
Let's go steal some during the break. And now another tale from the cell phone of Dick Cheney.

[01:26:51.370 --> 01:26:56.250]

I spread the United States of America. How are you? Fine. That's good. That's nice.

[01:27:18.990 --> 01:27:24.350]
Is it something I can help you with? Oh yes yes. It's just been a book that's coming out next week

[01:27:24.350 --> 01:27:29.450]
at your age. Uh frankly we we question its credibility and uh I was wondering if maybe you could

[01:27:29.450 --> 01:27:34.230]
wait a couple of months before actually putting it out. I'm sorry my son is breaking it.

[01:27:34.970 --> 01:27:41.650]
Did you just ask him not to break the block? I'm so out to be elected. Yes. After George Bush gets

[01:27:41.650 --> 01:27:45.970]
reelected print all you want. We won't care then. Why would I want to do that?

[01:27:47.770 --> 01:27:54.570]
Hello. Money growing up. What? Why? Why? Why? Oh my. If you're booked for a lease the terrorist win.

[01:27:54.950 --> 01:27:58.970]
Huh? You're messing with the president of the United States of America. Okay I'm hanging up now.

Bye bye. What's wrong with you? Hello? Hello?

[01:28:12.910 --> 01:28:17.730]
This has been another tale from the cell phone of Dick Cheney.

[01:28:17.790 --> 01:28:21.850]
Don't forget if you're seeing the Joyce Line New Borough as in Gustave a little bit the terrorist win.

[01:28:22.170 --> 01:28:27.490]
Don't forget those things. Okay. That's right. 1169 votes on a poll and Chris was saying 1200 votes today.

[01:28:27.490 --> 01:28:33.110]
Man you sell me really short. Nature already did that. I don't know. Really sure. What is wrong with you?

[01:28:33.750 --> 01:28:39.810]
In fact you know something? If I really if I were to know what I know now of course that's what life is all about.

[01:28:39.910 --> 01:28:44.270]
If I'd have just known back then what I know now all new young people out there just remember what all Uncle the

[01:28:44.270 --> 01:28:51.050]
old told you okay know it now meaning when you're young know it now and do it now and enjoy it now.

[01:28:51.290 --> 01:28:55.090]
Believe me because then you get all like me and you'll think well if only I had known then because

[01:28:55.090 --> 01:29:04.490]
that you're ain't going to happen now like a our chance 1171 oh god see this is the punishment I

[01:29:04.490 --> 01:29:08.970]
get for making fun of old people all those years that's right all those years on the air I'm talking

[01:29:08.970 --> 01:29:13.770]
about all the early bird dinners and the old crutches and all the old people with the lime game and now I'm

[01:29:13.770 --> 01:29:19.350]
one of them. Yeah. Oh god. I'm not by a long shot yet. What do you mean by that? Well you're not

[01:29:19.350 --> 01:29:23.630]
nearly as cretchy as they are. No no I'm not and then Sam like them I'm just talking about the

[01:29:23.630 --> 01:29:31.650]
from the age factor from the max factor. Let's see what do we got on the pool 1171 let me refresh it

[01:29:31.650 --> 01:29:36.150]
because I'm thinking well I know we're going to do 13 1172 see that they're coming in by the ones

[01:29:36.150 --> 01:29:41.950]
now that's the early bird crowd they don't want to overdo it. It's our turn sonny get out of here

[01:29:41.950 --> 01:29:47.030]
by you young punks we don't want no spring break on four-large of day old beat we don't want no young

[01:29:47.030 --> 01:29:52.770]
punks on South Beach with all that heavy jewelry on and all them tubing the goofballs down there and

[01:29:52.770 --> 01:29:58.670]
then facadones. Never have any faggot ruins like beef or only more delicious. I thought I figured

[01:29:58.670 --> 01:30:05.430]
you'd make it with pork. 5 6 7 0 5 60 fats. Trayf baby it's not halal. You sound like one of them

[01:30:05.430 --> 01:30:09.810]
terrorists to me you better start to have a lot of fat. It's not interesting how much in common.

[01:30:10.130 --> 01:30:14.230]
This is what really is it's it's almost amusing it's sick but it would be funny if it wasn't all

[01:30:14.230 --> 01:30:18.650]
the death in the blood shed. The Jews in the Arabs who got so much in common know they're in the

[01:30:18.650 --> 01:30:23.210]
circumcision thing and they don't want to eat trayf they don't want pork and kosher and halal I

[01:30:23.210 --> 01:30:29.170]
guess they're basically the same thing right and all this has a ride you know there's no feud like a

[01:30:29.170 --> 01:30:37.450]
family feud yeah that must be it WDQA M hello WDQA M hello

[01:30:37.850 --> 01:30:46.010]
yes this is the new Roger show yeah there legendary yeah that's it I sheep my pants

[01:30:48.750 --> 01:30:53.690]
oh well apparently that club is bigger than I would have ever said yeah well he did something

[01:30:53.690 --> 01:30:58.870]
this pants we can't say that word on the air he said he in his pants huh yeah from the show of

[01:30:58.870 --> 01:31:04.110]
course because it was so legendary 5 6 7 I see I I shouldn't know yesterday it was just an

[01:31:04.110 --> 01:31:09.130]
aberration because I got all whipped up and I'm thinking to myself what it it's like one of those

[01:31:09.130 --> 01:31:14.090]
things if you could package it and sell it you know I mean that that's how good it was like like

[01:31:14.090 --> 01:31:17.790]
occasionally like there one call we had earlier I have no idea what was so good about it but there

[01:31:17.790 --> 01:31:23.530]
was one you know and if you could just package it and sell it and multiply it and make you know

[01:31:23.530 --> 01:31:29.970]
make color of it but they can't do it we want everybody listening there this business about being

[01:31:29.970 --> 01:31:34.350]
the same four or five idiot colors on there let's get four or five thousand idiot colors then

[01:31:34.350 --> 01:31:38.910]
we'll have something okay jolly joe bill then I'll believe what you say about this phone being

[01:31:38.910 --> 01:31:44.990]
all I damn high-falute and important like we had yesterday yesterday it was like a fly opener man

[01:31:44.990 --> 01:31:51.350]
was I unbelievable wasn't it it was great even George who was probably the worst hard

[01:31:51.350 --> 01:31:55.150]
ass I've ever known in my life even George says it was great you just heard him say it was

[01:31:55.150 --> 01:31:59.950]

[01:32:40.790 --> 01:32:44.630]

[01:33:01.630 --> 01:33:07.970]
who during the three-mile incident I think you were on WNWS wow I've been listening to you ever since

[01:33:07.970 --> 01:33:15.370]

[01:33:15.370 --> 01:33:21.230]
to you about Toronto I go up there every month and it's like an oasis forming I love the place

you great see you okay see if he eats senator a a okay we'll be eating at the eating center you

[01:33:35.690 --> 01:33:41.270]
know the other day I went to this is terrible I went to GNC because I have this coq 10 that I

[01:33:41.270 --> 01:33:45.070]
take it's really good for your heart gets your pulse rate down I said it's very important stuff

[01:33:45.070 --> 01:33:49.570]
you know I've been taking it for years and they haven't they you know I used to hate GNC because

[01:33:49.570 --> 01:33:53.850]
I thought that everything they made was really very generic and very I don't know I think they

[01:33:53.850 --> 01:33:58.410]
just have everything yeah you know they've had all the same stuff and bottles with different labels

[01:33:58.410 --> 01:34:04.250]
on you know but but actually they do have some pretty good stuff now and the coq 10 is great so I

[01:34:04.250 --> 01:34:08.010]
go there because I can't get it anywhere else I mean you can get it in drug stores and stuff but

[01:34:08.010 --> 01:34:12.570]
not this particular brand because it's GNC brand so I guess it makes sense if you want GNC brand

[01:34:12.570 --> 01:34:17.150]
where do you go you don't go to rexhall you don't go to shoppers drug bar day you go to a GNC

[01:34:17.990 --> 01:34:22.330]
so after I buy my you know I got the bag full of stuff and I spent 140 bucks on four bottles of

[01:34:22.330 --> 01:34:26.330]
this plus my pantothertino cash you know and then what do you think I stopped for a little snack

[01:34:39.110 --> 01:34:43.950]
I was gonna give you some credit but you know I had a hot fudge Sunday on Rocky Road

[01:34:45.410 --> 01:34:49.810]

[01:34:50.730 --> 01:34:55.610]

[01:34:55.610 --> 01:34:58.150]

after city police officers say they busted in for smoking pot in a Hollywood park Sunday afternoon

[02:00:16.410 --> 02:00:20.110]

[02:00:30.570 --> 02:00:33.970]
court and state law enforcement records show no prior legal problems for the judge so

[02:00:33.970 --> 02:00:38.150]
he could qualify for a first-time offender pretrial drug diversion program but the allegation

[02:00:38.150 --> 02:00:41.910]
that he used in legal drug could result in a complaint to the judicial qualification commission

[02:00:41.910 --> 02:00:48.490]

[02:07:32.330 --> 02:07:35.390]
And then what's with people playing slot machines as a form of masturbation?

[02:07:36.190 --> 02:07:36.730]
There you go.

[02:07:37.530 --> 02:07:37.530]

[02:07:40.570 --> 02:07:42.250]
56705, well, there's a lot of tapping going on.

[02:07:42.310 --> 02:07:42.810]
We'll say that.

[02:07:43.810 --> 02:07:46.470]
56705, 60 in pound 5, 60 in the Verizon singular.

[02:07:46.770 --> 02:07:47.370]
Wireless line.

[02:07:48.890 --> 02:07:49.590]
What's with this?

[02:07:49.810 --> 02:07:50.510]
And what's with that?

[02:07:50.690 --> 02:07:51.590]
And what's with the...

[02:07:51.590 --> 02:07:52.910]
Yeah, what's with it?

[02:07:53.310 --> 02:07:54.030]
WQA, hello.

[02:07:56.610 --> 02:07:57.050]
QA.

[02:07:59.650 --> 02:08:00.710]
Sounds awfully quiet.

[02:08:00.810 --> 02:08:01.250]
It is quiet.

[02:08:01.670 --> 02:08:03.030]
I like those. Once in a while.

[02:08:03.470 --> 02:08:04.270]
You bring on screen.

[02:08:04.830 --> 02:08:05.570]
WQA, hello.

[02:08:07.490 --> 02:08:08.230]
WQA, hello.

[02:08:09.370 --> 02:08:10.270]
Hello, Uncle Neil.

[02:08:10.770 --> 02:08:11.330]
Yes, I am.

[02:08:12.050 --> 02:08:13.690]
Oh, God, I'm glad I got you put through.

[02:08:14.150 --> 02:08:16.690]
I just want to say how many great stories there were today.

[02:08:17.590 --> 02:08:19.810]
And certainly not trying to save the world.

[02:08:19.810 --> 02:08:24.090]
But the global warming thing is out of this world.

[02:08:24.370 --> 02:08:25.890]
Great stories today about it.

[02:08:26.410 --> 02:08:34.510]
But how on earth do you think that the rest of the world is going to get on the job with us?

[02:08:35.290 --> 02:08:36.050]
There's no way we can save it.

[02:08:36.050 --> 02:08:37.070]
Get out of the bird with us.

[02:08:37.270 --> 02:08:37.790]
Is that what you said?

[02:08:38.530 --> 02:08:39.310]
I'm sorry, what you saying?

[02:08:39.710 --> 02:08:40.630]
I said have a great day.

[02:08:41.250 --> 02:08:42.110]
Somebody QA and hello.

[02:08:42.110 --> 02:08:43.050]
And get some help.

[02:08:43.390 --> 02:08:44.110]
QA and hello.

[02:08:44.510 --> 02:08:46.270]
I think that the world I thought.

[02:08:47.330 --> 02:08:47.650]
Hahaha.

[02:08:51.450 --> 02:08:53.470]
If you look what he's you're ever, man.

[02:08:54.550 --> 02:08:55.190]
Wow, okay.

[02:08:55.890 --> 02:08:57.510]
Well, he must be with a judge out of the tree.

[02:08:58.590 --> 02:08:59.230]
SMOK, ING.

[02:09:00.370 --> 02:09:01.630]
1282 and a poor, by the way.

[02:09:02.350 --> 02:09:03.510]
You see this is more like it.

[02:09:03.570 --> 02:09:05.370]
This is the kind of show that we're going to be doing for now.

[02:09:05.610 --> 02:09:09.070]
I don't care whether Jolly, Rolly, or Joe or anybody else in there.

[02:09:09.070 --> 02:09:10.390]
I'm just doing my show.

[02:09:10.530 --> 02:09:11.030]
I'm doing my thing.

[02:09:11.290 --> 02:09:13.770]
I got my personal consultant's author advising me, you know.

[02:09:14.710 --> 02:09:17.810]
Maybe I'll get Walter Sabre on the phone to, you know, give me some really bad advice.

[02:09:18.050 --> 02:09:19.990]
This is what they want.

[02:09:20.950 --> 02:09:25.550]
Sitting here and reading all these depressing stories about George Bush's in Nazi and big Chinese in Nazi.

[02:09:25.910 --> 02:09:27.450]
And here I'm carrying Rumsfeld was in Nazi.

[02:09:27.770 --> 02:09:29.370]
I mean, we all night Carl Roe was in Nazi.

[02:09:29.610 --> 02:09:30.730]
Is there any news about them?

[02:09:30.850 --> 02:09:31.930]
What are we going to do about it?

[02:09:32.030 --> 02:09:32.030]

[02:09:32.870 --> 02:09:32.990]
Huh?

[02:09:32.990 --> 02:09:33.050]
Huh?

[02:09:33.690 --> 02:09:34.090]
Exactly.

[02:09:36.010 --> 02:09:37.610]
And I blame George for it.

[02:09:38.290 --> 02:09:38.950]
Sorry about that.

[02:09:39.430 --> 02:09:40.530]
Promoting all those stupid aspects.

[02:09:40.830 --> 02:09:42.070]
I mean, I've got a few, you know.

[02:09:42.550 --> 02:09:44.530]
Scientists accused his White House of Nazi tactics.

[02:09:44.850 --> 02:09:45.570]
I got that one there.

[02:09:46.590 --> 02:09:47.490]
I got some crap.

[02:09:48.370 --> 02:09:50.270]
Don't ever think I don't have a bunch of crap.

[02:09:51.990 --> 02:09:54.050]
Because when it comes to that, I'm the master, man.

[02:09:54.130 --> 02:09:54.830]
I'm the crap master.

[02:09:56.830 --> 02:10:00.190]
5670560 and £560 on the Verizon singular wireless line.

[02:10:00.910 --> 02:10:01.530]
WDQYM, hello.

[02:10:04.450 --> 02:10:05.010]
7070QYM, hello.

[02:10:05.630 --> 02:10:06.190]
It's a nail.

[02:10:06.650 --> 02:10:07.030]
Yes, sir.

[02:10:07.630 --> 02:10:08.670]
What a great day it is.

[02:10:08.770 --> 02:10:09.290]
And listen to you.

[02:10:09.370 --> 02:10:11.810]
Every single day I wake up by lunch break.

[02:10:12.270 --> 02:10:13.710]
You have lunch with you.

[02:10:13.870 --> 02:10:15.530]
And we pass the Buddha around.

[02:10:16.470 --> 02:10:17.770]
And you have some sushi with me.

[02:10:18.030 --> 02:10:19.210]
I'm not going to be in the nail.

[02:10:19.250 --> 02:10:20.110]
Oh, sushi!

[02:10:21.110 --> 02:10:21.350]
No!

[02:10:22.570 --> 02:10:23.170]
What are you?

[02:10:23.490 --> 02:10:24.950]
Teacher of course, that's why you.

[02:10:25.130 --> 02:10:26.630]
And become a professor at F.A.U.

[02:10:26.710 --> 02:10:28.890]
And come back to Miami so he can be my lover.

[02:10:29.390 --> 02:10:30.550]
Yeah, teacher of course, or what?

[02:10:30.550 --> 02:10:31.170]
Life?

[02:10:31.410 --> 02:10:32.550]
Of course, in life, yeah.

[02:10:32.550 --> 02:10:33.150]
I have no life.

[02:10:33.190 --> 02:10:33.790]
Yeah, it's serious.

[02:10:33.990 --> 02:10:34.710]
Of course, in comedy.

[02:10:35.390 --> 02:10:36.870]
200-E to both of them, Paul.

[02:10:38.410 --> 02:10:40.290]
Got some of these very important fangs, now.

[02:10:40.470 --> 02:10:40.590]
Let's see.

[02:10:40.710 --> 02:10:41.490]
Oh, not another priest.

[02:10:41.770 --> 02:10:42.810]
Jesus, God Almighty.

[02:10:43.290 --> 02:10:44.330]
Jesus, Chrysler Motors.

[02:10:45.350 --> 02:10:46.410]
Delray beats no less.

[02:10:48.290 --> 02:10:48.690]
Ah.

[02:10:49.630 --> 02:10:51.850]
A priest accused along with another clergyman.

[02:10:51.910 --> 02:10:53.110]
Oh, we know who these guys are.

[02:10:53.190 --> 02:10:54.870]
This is just enough Chuck on this story.

[02:10:56.590 --> 02:10:58.930]
A priest accused along with another clergyman.

[02:10:58.930 --> 02:11:01.490]
And if stealing more than $8 million from their church,

[02:11:01.630 --> 02:11:04.650]
once cracked that an auditor parish funds was a waste of money,

[02:11:05.050 --> 02:11:07.090]
well, then look at the date on this March 9th.

[02:11:07.110 --> 02:11:08.150]
I already did this story.

[02:11:09.430 --> 02:11:10.570]
Sorry, I got all excited.

[02:11:12.110 --> 02:11:14.010]
I already had done this story, man.

[02:11:14.090 --> 02:11:15.250]
This is March 9th.

[02:11:15.290 --> 02:11:16.650]
And today is March 20th.

[02:11:16.650 --> 02:11:21.370]
Last time I checked, we had this looked awfully familiar about Father Gwinin and John Skien.

[02:11:22.030 --> 02:11:23.970]
They're Skien and the Skien on Thin Ice.

[02:11:24.050 --> 02:11:26.530]
So whatever they're doing, hand in hand, gland in hand.

[02:11:27.550 --> 02:11:29.050]
All this crap with a church.

[02:11:30.990 --> 02:11:32.710]
You think you're not sick now, Brandon?

[02:11:32.890 --> 02:11:34.630]
I'm going to come over there and put you way into a coma.

[02:11:34.830 --> 02:11:36.270]
You're like, you know, see, I can't...

[02:11:36.270 --> 02:11:36.750]
I'm just...

[02:11:36.750 --> 02:11:39.070]
I'm juggling like five balls here today during the show.

[02:11:39.250 --> 02:11:39.510]
Really?

[02:11:39.870 --> 02:11:40.870]
And some of them already got five.

[02:11:41.950 --> 02:11:42.510]
It says...

[02:11:42.510 --> 02:11:43.230]
Oh, the odd men.

[02:11:43.470 --> 02:11:44.430]
Oh, my God.

[02:11:44.570 --> 02:11:45.530]
He's got the...

[02:11:47.130 --> 02:11:49.510]
Gremlins with your friend Zach Gallagher.

[02:11:49.610 --> 02:11:49.810]
Well, good.

[02:11:49.910 --> 02:11:50.450]
Enjoy it.

[02:11:50.850 --> 02:11:52.130]
Brandon, I turn out right now.

[02:11:52.230 --> 02:11:53.090]
Warm up the set.

[02:11:55.190 --> 02:11:56.830]
Jesus, God Almighty.

[02:11:57.250 --> 02:11:58.190]
Oh, my life.

[02:11:58.290 --> 02:11:59.490]
My what happened to my life?

[02:12:00.350 --> 02:12:01.090]
Sometimes I feel...

[02:12:01.830 --> 02:12:02.430]
You know how that goes.

[02:12:02.970 --> 02:12:04.010]
I wish I had the original one.

[02:12:04.650 --> 02:12:05.470]
You do, don't you?

[02:12:05.830 --> 02:12:06.270]
No, I don't.

[02:12:06.510 --> 02:12:07.230]
The build called her one.

[02:12:07.510 --> 02:12:08.430]
That's what I...

[02:12:08.430 --> 02:12:08.810]
I would not.

[02:12:09.290 --> 02:12:10.710]
This is not the original one.

[02:12:10.890 --> 02:12:11.830]
Are you any reminder what?

[02:12:12.110 --> 02:12:16.090]
Sometimes I feel myself...

[02:12:16.610 --> 02:12:18.290]
Was it on that CD I sent you while back?

[02:12:18.950 --> 02:12:19.310]
What?

[02:12:20.450 --> 02:12:21.290]
It's on the original.

[02:12:21.490 --> 02:12:21.790]
I don't know.

[02:12:21.790 --> 02:12:22.890]
I'm not out of here.

[02:12:23.310 --> 02:12:24.110]
The dream and again.

[02:12:52.910 --> 02:12:54.110]
I just love that man.

[02:12:54.270 --> 02:12:55.270]
I just love when they pick it like that.

[02:12:55.430 --> 02:12:56.510]
Starts bleeding all over the place.

[02:12:56.950 --> 02:12:57.790]
Club AD at an impol.

[02:12:57.890 --> 02:12:59.150]
It's Tuesday, March 20th.

[02:12:59.270 --> 02:13:01.210]
The day that the old man finally gave up with a mush.

[02:13:01.450 --> 02:13:02.630]
You know, no more mushing.

[02:13:03.210 --> 02:13:05.610]
Remember I told you I used to have that guy named BuzzMushin?

[02:13:05.990 --> 02:13:06.590]
No, Fat Guy.

[02:13:06.830 --> 02:13:07.390]
Yeah, I did.

[02:13:08.390 --> 02:13:09.410]
It's smelling and smelling.

[02:13:09.830 --> 02:13:10.970]
When I worked there for about a week.

[02:13:11.230 --> 02:13:12.050]
I told you that story.

[02:13:13.330 --> 02:13:15.630]
This was a big fat guy and we go to breakfast together.

[02:13:15.770 --> 02:13:17.390]
I was, you know, 80 dollar a week job.

[02:13:17.430 --> 02:13:19.910]
It's snowing and snowing because they couldn't find any of us a real job.

[02:13:19.910 --> 02:13:23.170]
So they hired us, you know, as a counselor, job counselors.

[02:13:23.910 --> 02:13:25.150]
Total bunch of crap.

[02:13:25.410 --> 02:13:27.670]
At any rate, BuzzMushin was this fat guy's name.

[02:13:27.950 --> 02:13:31.550]
And we go into the diner across from where we worked in Hollywood.

[02:13:32.130 --> 02:13:42.210]
And he would order like pancakes and French toast and bacon and cereal and the two eggs and a small diet drink.

[02:13:44.710 --> 02:13:45.390]
That's a true story.

[02:13:45.390 --> 02:13:45.790]
Yeah, sorry.

[02:13:45.790 --> 02:13:48.510]
Food or like everything on a menu and then a small diet drink.

[02:13:48.970 --> 02:13:49.390]
BuzzMushin.

[02:13:49.890 --> 02:13:50.950]
Enough of the mushin, baby.

[02:13:51.070 --> 02:13:51.790]
Okay, I get the message.

[02:13:51.870 --> 02:13:52.890]
Okay, hang on a second.

[02:13:53.530 --> 02:13:53.650]
Who?

[02:13:53.670 --> 02:13:53.810]
Who?

[02:13:55.310 --> 02:13:56.210]
Tell me what this is.

[02:13:56.270 --> 02:13:57.030]
Oh, no, the original.

[02:13:57.130 --> 02:13:57.510]
Let's sit.

[02:13:58.950 --> 02:14:00.190]
Sometimes I feel.

[02:14:00.790 --> 02:14:01.750]
Oh, my God.

[02:14:01.910 --> 02:14:02.710]
Like life.

[02:14:03.170 --> 02:14:04.190]
Pass me by.

[02:14:08.550 --> 02:14:09.990]
Sometimes I feel.

[02:14:11.290 --> 02:14:13.890]
Like people don't want to smile.

[02:14:13.890 --> 02:14:15.030]
You got it.

[02:14:15.130 --> 02:14:15.490]
It's a mess.

[02:14:15.690 --> 02:14:16.190]
C.D.S.

[02:14:16.670 --> 02:14:17.470]
I do.

[02:14:20.030 --> 02:14:21.010]
You sent me one.

[02:14:22.870 --> 02:14:25.090]
The whole bunch of miscellaneous crap on it, remember?

[02:14:26.530 --> 02:14:27.990]
The nebocca brine package.

[02:14:29.130 --> 02:14:31.710]
Biff collar on a radio.

[02:14:32.910 --> 02:14:35.610]
Biff collar on a radio.

[02:14:38.010 --> 02:14:38.590]
Maridio.

[02:14:39.010 --> 02:14:39.510]
That's what that's.

[02:14:39.650 --> 02:14:40.270]
That's what that's.

[02:14:40.910 --> 02:14:41.270]
Mmm.

[02:14:42.910 --> 02:14:44.750]
That's a bunch of weaverisms and stuff on there.

[02:14:45.950 --> 02:14:48.250]
Or just a sort of crap that I found on cards.

[02:14:50.050 --> 02:14:50.410]
Really?

[02:14:51.430 --> 02:14:51.790]
Things.

[02:14:52.350 --> 02:14:52.690]
I've tried.

[02:14:53.670 --> 02:14:55.730]
They don't make a much build cauldron anymore, I'll take it that.

[02:14:57.030 --> 02:15:00.270]
Okay, now this is not the disc, but this is an interesting one.

[02:15:00.350 --> 02:15:01.990]
It's got a lot of stuff on there that I never played with.

[02:15:02.010 --> 02:15:02.750]
You're going down.

[02:15:03.150 --> 02:15:05.470]
Explosion will be an extraordinary magnitude.

[02:15:07.890 --> 02:15:09.650]
Oh, maybe that's why I never played with.

[02:15:09.650 --> 02:15:10.830]
I'm a moon nerd.

[02:15:10.950 --> 02:15:12.350]
Get their basketball down in there.

[02:15:12.550 --> 02:15:13.830]
Spank with moon rocks.

[02:15:15.610 --> 02:15:16.050]
Alright.

[02:15:18.330 --> 02:15:20.890]
Nothing like getting spank with moon rocks.

[02:15:21.530 --> 02:15:23.970]
Isn't that how you get your moon off?

[02:15:24.170 --> 02:15:25.510]
I'm a moon nerd.

[02:15:25.670 --> 02:15:27.050]
Get their basketball down in there.

[02:15:27.270 --> 02:15:28.490]
Spank with moon rocks.

[02:15:28.710 --> 02:15:30.190]
Okay, 1292 votes on a poll.

[02:15:30.290 --> 02:15:31.830]
I told you we had 13 in the bank.

[02:15:32.850 --> 02:15:34.710]
Oh, and there's that ugly kid with glasses.

[02:15:34.970 --> 02:15:36.530]
That boy scout cubed in North Carolina.

[02:15:36.750 --> 02:15:39.270]
He's going to get medical attention after being a member of the United States.

[02:15:39.670 --> 02:15:42.130]
And then they'll take him up in the woods and see if they can move him again.

[02:15:42.250 --> 02:15:43.010]
They try like hell.

[02:15:43.690 --> 02:15:44.430]
And he came back.

[02:15:45.210 --> 02:15:47.350]
So I have it a bad pit.

[02:15:48.130 --> 02:15:50.590]
And you take it out of the woods and you let it go and hope that it...

[02:15:50.590 --> 02:15:52.130]
And then all of a sudden there's a scratching at the door.

[02:15:52.390 --> 02:15:53.810]
Oh, no, not you again.

[02:15:55.610 --> 02:15:56.230]
WQAM, hello.

[02:15:58.190 --> 02:15:58.550]
QAM.

[02:16:00.290 --> 02:16:00.650]
QAM.

[02:16:03.130 --> 02:16:04.030]
What is it?

[02:16:04.030 --> 02:16:05.430]
It's Ron and there's a good one.

[02:16:06.170 --> 02:16:07.090]
That's not the question.

[02:16:07.290 --> 02:16:08.910]
Who it is, it's a quote of one of those.

[02:16:09.570 --> 02:16:09.970]
Wow.

[02:16:10.870 --> 02:16:11.570]
WQAM, hello.

[02:16:12.490 --> 02:16:13.390]
Oh, I can.

[02:16:14.710 --> 02:16:17.150]
W. Well, thanks for finding the answer in the question.

[02:16:17.310 --> 02:16:17.930]
QAM, hello.

[02:16:18.410 --> 02:16:18.830]
Hey, Neil.

[02:16:19.250 --> 02:16:19.630]
Yes, sir.

[02:16:20.190 --> 02:16:22.710]
We got a big fan out here in Mahokie.

[02:16:23.650 --> 02:16:23.910]
Yeah.

[02:16:24.310 --> 02:16:27.830]
And you know, South Florida radio hasn't been the same since Rick and Sons last.

[02:16:28.350 --> 02:16:29.150]
Yeah, thank God.

[02:16:32.630 --> 02:16:33.470]
I'm in Mahokie.

[02:16:33.590 --> 02:16:35.130]
Yeah, Rick Routi was big in Mahokie.

[02:16:35.250 --> 02:16:37.510]
In fact, the son said he probably owned a long in the Mahokie.

[02:16:37.590 --> 02:16:39.070]
Now we said, in the Mahokie.

[02:16:39.550 --> 02:16:40.070]
In the Mahokie.

[02:16:41.410 --> 02:16:44.770]
1292, I bet if I refresh this baby, and then I say we're going to go way over 13 today.

[02:16:45.270 --> 02:16:47.210]
1295, they're coming in little chunks now, Chris.

[02:16:47.550 --> 02:16:48.110]
Eat your heart out.

[02:16:48.370 --> 02:16:49.550]
And the Perichungles got full.

[02:16:51.170 --> 02:16:55.410]
I thought that the, I guess way back when it wasn't in the Gables, the Perichungle or was it in the Grove.

[02:16:55.570 --> 02:16:57.670]
I'm trying to think it was a South Miami where was it?

[02:16:57.670 --> 02:16:58.730]
It would be original.

[02:16:58.910 --> 02:17:02.090]
It would be down 111.

[02:17:02.270 --> 02:17:02.590]
112.

[02:17:04.250 --> 02:17:05.790]
112 in Galloway or something.

[02:17:05.930 --> 02:17:06.690]
I forgot the other cross three.

[02:17:06.770 --> 02:17:08.530]
Galloway, that's where Norman Brothers produces.

[02:17:08.730 --> 02:17:09.990]
Man, do I love Norman Brothers' produce?

[02:17:10.190 --> 02:17:11.250]
I wonder if it's still there.

[02:17:12.770 --> 02:17:13.070]
It is.

[02:17:13.590 --> 02:17:15.630]
Can't believe it used to be okay before it got so overcrowded.

[02:17:15.750 --> 02:17:16.970]
Nobody's speaking English no more.

[02:17:17.050 --> 02:17:17.650]
That was the problem.

[02:17:17.770 --> 02:17:19.270]
No, No, no, no, no, no, no.

[02:17:19.330 --> 02:17:19.610]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

[02:17:20.610 --> 02:17:21.090]
WQ way.

[02:17:21.150 --> 02:17:21.350]
Hello.

[02:17:22.050 --> 02:17:23.270]
Yes, sir.

[02:17:23.270 --> 02:17:26.230]
Hey, Jerry, about the Judge and Ann and the Colonel got called in the car.

[02:17:26.350 --> 02:17:26.850]
Smoke a weed.

[02:17:30.050 --> 02:17:30.710]
WQA and Hello.

[02:17:31.570 --> 02:17:32.530]
Call the police.

[02:17:36.210 --> 02:17:36.870]
WQA and Hello.

[02:17:37.390 --> 02:17:38.270]
That's still got nothing.

[02:17:39.610 --> 02:17:40.310]
You sure now?

[02:17:40.570 --> 02:17:41.390]
Okay, just double second.

[02:17:42.290 --> 02:17:44.190]
5, 6, 7, he can call 2, 3 times a day.

[02:17:44.270 --> 02:17:46.570]
Just in case, one of these days, he'll say, oh, I got something.

[02:17:47.190 --> 02:17:48.690]
But it might be contagious, you never know.

[02:17:51.410 --> 02:17:53.330]
So you'll see that they'll make it come back.

[02:17:53.410 --> 02:17:55.470]
You just, you know, you expect too much all at once.

[02:17:55.850 --> 02:17:57.530]
I'm sticking with it, man. I'm going to persevere.

[02:17:58.390 --> 02:18:01.290]
Alright, I'm sticking my nose right to the old Brian Stahl.

[02:18:01.470 --> 02:18:04.390]
So if I could be like, like Glenn Campbell, man, I'll be a Brian Stone Cowboy.

[02:18:06.750 --> 02:18:07.470]
WQA and Hello.

[02:18:10.010 --> 02:18:10.750]
QA and Hello.

[02:18:11.350 --> 02:18:15.130]
Yeah, very general used to be the cross tree was one 12th and the whole cover.

[02:18:15.850 --> 02:18:16.250]
Right.

[02:18:16.810 --> 02:18:17.190]
Right.

[02:18:17.190 --> 02:18:19.170]
And didn't it go out with the hurricane or something?

[02:18:20.050 --> 02:18:21.690]
They moved it over to the beach.

[02:18:22.330 --> 02:18:23.770]
It's like I'm a little island now.

[02:18:23.850 --> 02:18:24.730]
Very jungle island.

[02:18:25.250 --> 02:18:28.250]
Well, and then inevitably nobody can get there because there's nobody going.

[02:18:28.350 --> 02:18:28.970]
Nobody wants to go.

[02:18:29.050 --> 02:18:29.690]
There are four votes.

[02:18:29.870 --> 02:18:31.210]
Four votes out of 495.

[02:18:31.470 --> 02:18:32.310]
That's pretty lame.

[02:18:32.910 --> 02:18:33.950]
That's pretty lame.

[02:18:34.550 --> 02:18:38.490]
To go see the parrots in the McCaws, you know, you can go see the parrots in the Trappocanon.

[02:18:38.550 --> 02:18:39.270]
Next time you go to Vegas.

[02:18:41.470 --> 02:18:41.790]
Okay.

[02:18:42.250 --> 02:18:43.410]
You ever go in the Trappocanon?

[02:18:43.550 --> 02:18:43.770]
Sure.

[02:18:44.130 --> 02:18:45.750]
I just had pretty good luck in the Trappocanon.

[02:18:46.430 --> 02:18:47.870]
That's where the rap city used to be.

[02:18:48.290 --> 02:18:48.790]
That is correct.

[02:18:48.990 --> 02:18:49.350]
Oh, man.

[02:18:49.450 --> 02:18:50.170]
Was that a great restaurant?

[02:18:50.790 --> 02:18:52.290]
They had the damn best.

[02:18:53.030 --> 02:18:53.670]
The best.

[02:18:53.810 --> 02:18:55.270]
What is the dessert I'm trying to think of now?

[02:18:55.610 --> 02:18:56.590]
Not bake the last one.

[02:18:56.670 --> 02:18:57.090]
What's the other one?

[02:18:57.150 --> 02:18:57.590]
Banana's Foster.

[02:18:58.070 --> 02:18:58.650]
Banana's Foster.

[02:18:58.830 --> 02:18:59.390]
Now you're talking.

[02:18:59.710 --> 02:19:02.030]
Now we finally got to the meat of the matter.

[02:19:03.350 --> 02:19:03.990]
Banana's Foster.

[02:19:05.050 --> 02:19:06.230]
I think we might have had that there too.

[02:19:07.190 --> 02:19:07.190]

[02:19:08.550 --> 02:19:08.670]
Mmm.

[02:19:09.070 --> 02:19:09.070]

[02:19:11.610 --> 02:19:11.890]
Yeah.

[02:19:12.050 --> 02:19:13.430]
Seeing you wonder, you scratch your head.

[02:19:13.430 --> 02:19:15.570]
You're going to have to go to the so great when out of business.

[02:19:15.570 --> 02:19:17.670]
The rap city restaurant inside the Trappocanon.

[02:19:18.010 --> 02:19:19.090]
Maybe somebody will know.

[02:19:19.230 --> 02:19:20.230]
Maybe somebody knows Jaime Roth.

[02:19:20.810 --> 02:19:22.670]
Or maybe Frankie Pantangely might know.

[02:19:23.110 --> 02:19:24.350]
Come and have a problem with nothing.

[02:19:25.030 --> 02:19:26.830]
Can you hit it on the side of the picture more than night?

[02:19:27.690 --> 02:19:28.110]
Frankie.

[02:19:28.690 --> 02:19:29.730]
I sure will shoot it.

[02:19:30.030 --> 02:19:30.210]
Mike.

[02:19:30.830 --> 02:19:33.670]
Are you shooting high up in the St. Aaron Mountains?

[02:19:34.370 --> 02:19:36.950]
And you're making, uh, what do you think it's happening?

[02:19:37.530 --> 02:19:37.850]
It's happening.

[02:19:38.110 --> 02:19:38.250]
It's happening.

[02:19:38.270 --> 02:19:38.410]
It's happening.

[02:19:38.990 --> 02:19:40.070]
Oh, I'm looking at this.

[02:19:40.290 --> 02:19:40.990]
Sorry, Frankie.

[02:19:42.190 --> 02:19:43.030]
Brockport, New York.

[02:19:43.170 --> 02:19:44.510]
That's right near Rochester, my hometown.

[02:19:44.850 --> 02:19:45.950]
Oh, it's all over the place.

[02:19:46.090 --> 02:19:46.730]
It's like a disease.

[02:19:46.990 --> 02:19:47.350]
It's spreading.

[02:19:48.390 --> 02:19:52.770]
A 52-year-old Roman Catholic priest is accused of forcibly touching a female coworker.

[02:19:52.990 --> 02:19:54.190]
Well, at least it's a female, as time.

[02:19:54.970 --> 02:19:56.390]
And well, then say what she was.

[02:19:57.070 --> 02:20:01.790]
The Reverend Peter Aynon Bodu was arrested and charged with three misdemeanor counts

[02:20:01.790 --> 02:20:03.270]
of harassment and one of forcible touching.

[02:20:03.550 --> 02:20:06.030]
He was a reign before Brockport Village Judge Lys Friday,

[02:20:06.030 --> 02:20:09.030]
released to return to court December 6th.

[02:20:11.390 --> 02:20:13.970]
And this is the 16th of March.

[02:20:14.290 --> 02:20:18.090]
The DIC Sir Rochester said in the statement that Aynon Bodu requested and was granted a

[02:20:18.090 --> 02:20:21.050]
personally evabisance until a finalist was sentenced to the charges.

[02:20:21.970 --> 02:20:25.050]
The charges accused him of kissing a woman with whom he worked a few months ago.

[02:20:25.670 --> 02:20:27.350]
Little didn't say where he kissed her though.

[02:20:28.430 --> 02:20:29.930]
Remember that song by the Everly Brothers?

[02:20:30.130 --> 02:20:30.710]
Where I kissed you?

[02:20:31.150 --> 02:20:31.490]
Yeah.

[02:20:31.850 --> 02:20:35.490]
Aynon Bodu was ordained in his native Ghana in 1984.

[02:20:35.790 --> 02:20:36.430]
Where I kissed you?

[02:20:36.530 --> 02:20:36.950]
Backed away.

[02:20:37.190 --> 02:20:37.190]

[02:20:37.530 --> 02:20:38.830]
And came to Rochester in 1988.

[02:20:38.830 --> 02:20:42.450]
He served the pastor of the Church of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Brockport

[02:20:42.450 --> 02:20:43.510]
since 1999.

[02:20:44.470 --> 02:20:45.870]
Oh, I love that's my favorite church.

[02:20:46.190 --> 02:20:48.990]
The Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Brockport.

[02:20:49.090 --> 02:20:49.850]
I'm going right now.

[02:20:50.150 --> 02:20:50.990]
I'm going to get on my knees.

[02:20:52.110 --> 02:20:55.090]
Here's one that says, are we ever going to be able to listen to your show here in Orlando?

[02:20:55.570 --> 02:20:56.430]
Yeah, it gets your computer.

[02:20:57.270 --> 02:20:59.890]
I moved here five years ago, but 90% of talk radio is conservative.

[02:21:00.250 --> 02:21:03.710]
The only good show is the Phillips file, but he's known as the Rogers.

[02:21:04.450 --> 02:21:05.590]
And this is Viva la Canada.

[02:21:05.950 --> 02:21:07.570]
I think it's Phillips or something?

[02:21:07.570 --> 02:21:08.310]
No, Phillips.

[02:21:08.510 --> 02:21:09.110]
What's that guy's name?

[02:21:09.290 --> 02:21:11.090]
He's always talking about me like everybody else.

[02:21:11.250 --> 02:21:11.910]
I can't think of it.

[02:21:12.110 --> 02:21:12.690]
Garden Phillips?

[02:21:13.150 --> 02:21:13.610]
Midnight Phillips?

[02:21:13.970 --> 02:21:14.070]
No.

[02:21:14.610 --> 02:21:15.290]
Phillips show.

[02:21:16.090 --> 02:21:16.130]
No.

[02:21:16.850 --> 02:21:17.670]
Phillips screwdriver.

[02:21:17.930 --> 02:21:18.230]
I like that.

[02:21:18.450 --> 02:21:19.730]
I always get to have one in your back pocket.

[02:21:21.310 --> 02:21:22.650]
Don't sit down fast, though.

[02:21:23.470 --> 02:21:25.230]
13 out of 11 votes, baby.

[02:21:25.810 --> 02:21:26.250]
Unbelievable.

[02:21:26.770 --> 02:21:27.350]
I'm the only one.

[02:21:27.510 --> 02:21:29.250]
I'm the only one.

[02:21:29.350 --> 02:21:31.170]
Not as unbelievable as the Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary before.

[02:21:31.230 --> 02:21:33.110]
Now the folks get bent on you.

[02:21:34.490 --> 02:21:36.990]
And the powers you possess.

[02:21:38.050 --> 02:21:42.090]
Or since you saved his life with your flight scissors, right?

[02:21:42.470 --> 02:21:45.010]
He's got a job for you to do.

[02:21:46.730 --> 02:21:46.870]
What?

[02:21:47.490 --> 02:21:47.670]
What?

[02:21:48.010 --> 02:21:48.010]

[02:21:49.210 --> 02:21:50.230]
Virgin Mary.

[02:21:52.890 --> 02:21:54.030]
Virgin Mary.

[02:21:55.490 --> 02:21:57.990]
You have a brand new style too.

[02:21:59.350 --> 02:22:01.930]
We love the way you want your doom.

[02:22:03.110 --> 02:22:07.150]
With the victory on your chest and full proofs to light dress,

[02:22:07.350 --> 02:22:09.650]
The bending of the war of prayer.

[02:22:11.990 --> 02:22:12.650]
Oh.

[02:22:15.370 --> 02:22:16.690]
Virgin Mary.

[02:22:17.990 --> 02:22:19.190]
Virgin Mary.

[02:22:20.610 --> 02:22:23.090]
Who's with the speed of what the sound?

[02:22:24.850 --> 02:22:27.210]
Sex of that nice, straight to hell.

[02:22:28.210 --> 02:22:30.190]
When a building starts to roll,

[02:22:30.190 --> 02:22:32.050]
We go to the east and we know

[02:22:32.050 --> 02:22:35.310]
Your expression comes with my hateful.

[02:22:39.530 --> 02:22:39.990]
Oh.

[02:22:39.990 --> 02:22:39.990]

[02:22:40.970 --> 02:22:42.410]
What is that?

[02:22:43.110 --> 02:22:43.730]
What is it?

[02:22:47.470 --> 02:22:49.790]
All that we say and do is right.

[02:22:50.030 --> 02:22:50.550]
I know that.

[02:22:51.250 --> 02:22:53.150]
One 19, that's what our management says here.

[02:22:53.250 --> 02:22:54.910]
That's the esports mafia, QAAM.

[02:22:55.550 --> 02:22:58.550]
13 out of 11 votes on a poll in case you didn't hear me talking over the Virgin Mary.

[02:22:58.550 --> 02:23:00.430]
Don't be talking over the Virgin Mary man.

[02:23:00.550 --> 02:23:02.110]
She might have something really important they'd say,

[02:23:02.290 --> 02:23:04.970]
Especially when she's hanging on to them over passage in Chicago,

[02:23:05.210 --> 02:23:07.590]
Or on the side of the bank building in clear water.

[02:23:08.030 --> 02:23:10.830]
She hangs out in some very strange places of the Virgin Mary.

[02:23:11.670 --> 02:23:15.050]
Paul and the Gable says the pair of jungle moves to Watson Island and now it sucks.

[02:23:15.530 --> 02:23:17.770]
Maybe that's why it's bringing up the rear on our poll today.

[02:23:18.070 --> 02:23:18.990]
I knew there had to be a reason.

[02:23:20.370 --> 02:23:24.130]
It says it's just another modern iteration of a once classic place to visit.

[02:23:25.010 --> 02:23:26.970]
It might as well go on the way of the serpentarium.

[02:23:26.970 --> 02:23:27.970]
It says, oh no.

[02:23:28.610 --> 02:23:29.610]
Norman is still strong.

[02:23:29.770 --> 02:23:31.030]
Norman brothers as a shorties.

[02:23:31.750 --> 02:23:35.730]
Isn't that why they spend a billion dollars to build the metro rail so that everybody goes to the shorties bar.

[02:23:35.750 --> 02:23:36.070]
That's right.

[02:23:38.190 --> 02:23:39.050]
I'm going to tell you something.

[02:23:39.150 --> 02:23:43.190]
They must know the right people because when somebody, when the government spends a billion dollars of your tax dollars,

[02:23:43.470 --> 02:23:44.770]
So everybody can go to lunch at shorties.

[02:23:44.830 --> 02:23:46.110]
You've got to say, all right.

[02:23:46.630 --> 02:23:47.690]
I respect that a lot.

[02:23:49.190 --> 02:23:50.430]
13, 15 out of 14.

[02:23:50.650 --> 02:23:52.610]
If we really put the pedal to the metal man,

[02:23:52.610 --> 02:23:54.490]
Did I say something about 14?

[02:23:54.750 --> 02:23:56.010]
Huh? Huh? Huh?

[02:23:56.250 --> 02:23:56.710]
Did I say that?

[02:23:57.390 --> 02:24:06.410]
So the guy that called earlier for my email is writing a book about churches and clergy and the things they do.

[02:24:06.410 --> 02:24:13.890]
They do things they say and he's heard me talk about my experiences and wants to pick my brain and get some stories.

[02:24:14.310 --> 02:24:15.590]
Well, I can say that on the air.

[02:24:15.790 --> 02:24:16.790]
I guess he didn't want to.

[02:24:17.150 --> 02:24:17.650]
Well, why not?

[02:24:17.650 --> 02:24:18.350]
I don't know.

[02:24:18.510 --> 02:24:19.470]
I think he's not embarrassing.

[02:24:19.630 --> 02:24:21.670]
He just flipped a little cash out of the table for this or what?

[02:24:21.990 --> 02:24:24.810]
He's not really any treasure island scams.

[02:24:24.950 --> 02:24:25.910]
Hi, a pally.

[02:24:26.070 --> 02:24:26.730]
Or something like that.

[02:24:26.790 --> 02:24:27.610]
I wish, but so far.

[02:24:27.630 --> 02:24:29.490]
I know something that I just don't on me.

[02:24:30.250 --> 02:24:33.910]
This is, I don't know how to say it, but this has been a phenomenal day for me.

[02:24:33.990 --> 02:24:35.510]
Well, I'm serious.

[02:24:35.510 --> 02:24:36.310]
It's been great all day.

[02:24:36.530 --> 02:24:37.770]
A watershed day.

[02:24:37.910 --> 02:24:39.730]
It's been a watershed day.

[02:24:39.810 --> 02:24:41.990]
I don't know what that means, but they say that.

[02:24:42.070 --> 02:24:44.350]
I mean, I'm going to the watershed and get spanked with the moon night.

[02:24:44.350 --> 02:24:45.050]
I'm going to the sun over.

[02:24:45.150 --> 02:24:45.670]
You know what they say?

[02:24:45.690 --> 02:24:46.270]
On the moon?

[02:24:46.810 --> 02:24:49.870]
Nerds get their pants pulled down and they are spanked with moon rock.

[02:24:49.990 --> 02:24:50.230]
Oh.

[02:24:52.350 --> 02:24:53.910]
But that's another piece of good news.

[02:24:54.070 --> 02:24:57.050]
It's been a long time since Fatboy has bugged us.

[02:24:57.190 --> 02:24:58.310]
You know, that particular Fatboy?

[02:24:59.130 --> 02:24:59.490]
Yeah.

[02:24:59.930 --> 02:25:00.490]
That one like,

[02:25:00.690 --> 02:25:01.590]
Hi, a pally.

[02:25:01.750 --> 02:25:01.990]
Yeah.

[02:25:02.870 --> 02:25:04.750]
But this has been a watershed day in my life.

[02:25:04.950 --> 02:25:08.250]
I don't know what it's just, everything is like falling into place.

[02:25:08.430 --> 02:25:10.490]
Like it like in a puzzle.

[02:25:10.670 --> 02:25:12.850]
You know, you're taking the pieces of a puzzle and putting them together.

[02:25:13.730 --> 02:25:14.350]
Mm-hmm.

[02:25:15.030 --> 02:25:16.430]
Sounds awfully melodramatic to me.

[02:25:16.530 --> 02:25:17.090]
And it is.

[02:25:18.590 --> 02:25:19.070]
Oh.

[02:25:19.790 --> 02:25:21.410]
Don't tell me another one.

[02:25:23.650 --> 02:25:24.130]
Worcester.

[02:25:24.450 --> 02:25:26.410]
This is from Worcester Mass, or some people say,

[02:25:26.670 --> 02:25:28.350]
would you please pass the Worcester Shire Sauce?

[02:25:29.770 --> 02:25:31.090]
Or is it Worcester?

[02:25:31.350 --> 02:25:32.090]
They say it's a somewhere.

[02:25:32.330 --> 02:25:33.890]
Isn't it amazing how it literates some people are?

[02:25:34.170 --> 02:25:34.490]
Oh, yeah.

[02:25:35.010 --> 02:25:35.490]
Yeah.

[02:25:35.670 --> 02:25:38.190]
Pass the Worcester or Shorch?

[02:25:39.450 --> 02:25:42.830]
A suspended priest who was arrested earlier this year after allegedly assaulting

[02:25:42.830 --> 02:25:46.230]
his mother and sister has been arrested again on similar charges.

[02:25:46.450 --> 02:25:48.450]
Well, maybe there are a couple of bitches who knows, you know?

[02:25:49.530 --> 02:25:52.130]
The Reverend Joseph Koonin, 50, was arrested Friday,

[02:25:52.490 --> 02:25:55.970]
and it's scheduled to be arraigned in doubly court next Monday on charges

[02:25:55.970 --> 02:25:57.370]
including domestic assault and battery.

[02:25:57.650 --> 02:26:02.010]
On a person over 65, his mother and a disabled person, his sister is mentally retarded.

[02:26:02.290 --> 02:26:02.710]
Oh, lovely.

[02:26:03.350 --> 02:26:03.790]
Lovely.

[02:26:04.290 --> 02:26:04.510]
Pops.

[02:26:05.530 --> 02:26:09.910]
He also faces charges of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, a 12 pack of Pepsi.

[02:26:10.310 --> 02:26:10.530]
Oh.

[02:26:11.030 --> 02:26:12.670]
I hate when they use that.

[02:26:13.630 --> 02:26:14.070]
Ah!

[02:26:14.650 --> 02:26:14.830]
Ha!

[02:26:16.310 --> 02:26:19.550]
Worcester police charge in Anthony Saud told the telegram and he said it was to

[02:26:19.550 --> 02:26:21.090]
that both women had superficial injuries.

[02:26:21.530 --> 02:26:26.410]
Police were called to the residents by a neighbor who had been contacted by Koonin's sister, Patricia Loiselle.

[02:26:27.410 --> 02:26:29.530]
Koonin lives with a sister and mother, Mabel Koonin.

[02:26:30.310 --> 02:26:31.350]
Mabel, black label.

[02:26:32.150 --> 02:26:33.150]
You ever hear those spots?

[02:26:33.150 --> 02:26:33.690]
Of course not.

[02:26:33.970 --> 02:26:34.070]
Nope.

[02:26:34.910 --> 02:26:36.370]
He was removed from, isn't it amazing?

[02:26:36.590 --> 02:26:37.490]
Not amazing.

[02:26:37.490 --> 02:26:40.510]
But it's kind of neat that in different parts of the country there are different like regional

[02:26:40.510 --> 02:26:41.550]
beers, you know?

[02:26:41.790 --> 02:26:44.730]
Like Genesee, Jenny, in North-State, New York, and black label.

[02:26:47.010 --> 02:26:48.270]
Now who is a...

[02:26:48.270 --> 02:26:49.390]
What are the callings black label?

[02:26:49.530 --> 02:26:50.990]
Is that who makes black label callings?

[02:26:51.330 --> 02:26:51.770]
I don't know.

[02:26:51.850 --> 02:26:52.510]
I'll take your word for it.

[02:26:52.710 --> 02:26:53.690]
Mabel, black label.

[02:26:54.670 --> 02:26:56.670]
And then of course there's always the one from Utica.

[02:26:56.950 --> 02:26:57.270]
You see.

[02:26:57.530 --> 02:26:58.030]
Utica club.

[02:26:58.250 --> 02:26:58.550]
You see.

[02:26:59.250 --> 02:27:01.170]
He was removed from ministry at St. John's.

[02:27:01.410 --> 02:27:04.490]
When I start battling like this, this means for sure that I'm...

[02:27:05.330 --> 02:27:09.570]
They're going to find me like a little pile of soddest at the bottom, hopefully after two o'clock.

[02:27:10.370 --> 02:27:11.830]
Right here at the bottom of my chair.

[02:27:12.990 --> 02:27:15.030]
He was removed from ministry at St. John's.

[02:27:15.150 --> 02:27:18.290]
Roman Catholic Church in August 2002 by former Worcester Dyshees Bishop.

[02:27:18.690 --> 02:27:23.750]
Daniel Riley, an oak him to Rick, after allegations at Koonin committed sexual misconduct in the 70s,

[02:27:24.090 --> 02:27:26.230]
before he became a priest, before he put on the frock.

[02:27:27.910 --> 02:27:31.990]
Now let me ask you, if you put on the frock, does that make you look like...

[02:27:31.990 --> 02:27:32.470]
Friar tuck?

[02:27:33.450 --> 02:27:34.330]
Friar frock.

[02:27:35.590 --> 02:27:35.990]
Friar.

[02:27:38.150 --> 02:27:38.550]
Friar.

[02:27:38.870 --> 02:27:39.270]
Friar.

[02:27:39.450 --> 02:27:39.450]

[02:27:39.450 --> 02:27:39.790]
Friar frock.

[02:27:40.530 --> 02:27:41.930]
And then try to wear that baby.

[02:27:42.490 --> 02:27:44.290]
And I think I am becoming an important thing.

[02:27:44.430 --> 02:27:47.230]
I've just been too much... so much exciting activity today.

[02:27:48.430 --> 02:27:49.230]
I'm like...

[02:27:49.230 --> 02:27:51.130]
I'm going to fall into a pile of mush right in the chair.

[02:27:51.310 --> 02:27:51.850]
No more mush.

[02:27:52.830 --> 02:27:55.890]
In February, Koonin was arrested on charges including domestic assault and battery,

[02:27:56.050 --> 02:27:59.330]
and intimidating a witness after another dispute between Koonin and sister and his mother.

[02:27:59.550 --> 02:28:01.490]
Sounds like some domestic problems there, you know?

[02:28:02.390 --> 02:28:06.010]
In August, both women filed statements with the court asking that the charges be drafted

[02:28:06.010 --> 02:28:07.690]
and the charges later dismissed.

[02:28:07.970 --> 02:28:08.910]
But he's back at it again.

[02:28:09.670 --> 02:28:13.930]
Lots of priestess there were lots of problem, multi-problems, as they say, in Italia.

[02:28:14.210 --> 02:28:16.190]
That guy was telling me about the bumper sticker.

[02:28:16.190 --> 02:28:16.970]
Can you believe that guy?

[02:28:17.570 --> 02:28:19.470]
About the Neo-Guy bumper sticker in Italy and Rome?

[02:28:19.810 --> 02:28:21.190]
Why would he make up a story like that?

[02:28:21.610 --> 02:28:22.370]
Yeah, that's right.

[02:28:22.630 --> 02:28:25.810]
What kind of a lunatic, what kind of a maniac caught on the Neo-Rodger show?

[02:28:25.930 --> 02:28:27.830]
What kind of a story like that?

[02:28:28.070 --> 02:28:30.450]
I mean, there's way better stories to make up if you were going to make one up.

[02:28:31.670 --> 02:28:34.770]
Watch your language, Brandon. He's back again on this incident.

[02:28:35.230 --> 02:28:39.110]
I'm telling you, these guys have got me going upside the back where it must be punishment.

[02:28:39.610 --> 02:28:41.830]
It must be punishment for something evil I've done.

[02:28:41.970 --> 02:28:42.890]
Well, you deserve it.

[02:28:42.890 --> 02:28:43.670]
I do deserve it.

[02:28:43.730 --> 02:28:44.210]
Too much mush.

[02:28:45.330 --> 02:28:45.930]
Too much mush?

[02:28:46.110 --> 02:28:47.550]
The dogs that I did arrive right, race?

[02:28:47.910 --> 02:28:49.090]
And what is the I did arrive, race?

[02:28:49.130 --> 02:28:50.810]
Or is it that dick-perton bit at that time?

[02:28:51.010 --> 02:28:53.730]
Yeah, it's a long-distance dog sled race.

[02:28:53.770 --> 02:28:54.330]
Dog sled race.

[02:28:54.710 --> 02:28:55.010]
In a last one.

[02:28:56.590 --> 02:28:58.270]
And they say mush to the dogs?

[02:28:58.490 --> 02:28:58.730]
They do.

[02:28:58.730 --> 02:28:59.670]
They do the dogs say to them like, point.

[02:28:59.810 --> 02:29:01.090]
I think it's Eskimo or Inuit.

[02:29:02.150 --> 02:29:02.870]
1320 Inuit.

[02:29:03.290 --> 02:29:04.630]
Oh, we got the Inuits here, baby.

[02:29:05.090 --> 02:29:05.610]
That's what I heard.

[02:29:06.190 --> 02:29:06.330]
Yeah.

[02:29:06.670 --> 02:29:07.890]
Say mush to what they've actually been doing.

[02:29:07.890 --> 02:29:09.730]
I can't get out of the new I knew DeFo's a real...

[02:29:10.610 --> 02:29:10.690]
Yeah.

[02:29:10.950 --> 02:29:12.290]
Say mush to what it's he if they give you some.

[02:29:14.250 --> 02:29:15.850]
Oh, enough of the mush, okay?

[02:29:15.930 --> 02:29:16.610]
That's what Buzz said.

[02:29:16.770 --> 02:29:17.250]
Enough of the mush.

[02:29:18.170 --> 02:29:19.570]
I'll have 14 pancakes.

[02:29:19.810 --> 02:29:22.410]
I have 16 orders of bacon and some sausage on the side.

[02:29:22.690 --> 02:29:23.770]
And a small diet drink.

[02:29:25.630 --> 02:29:26.230]
What a guy.

[02:29:26.230 --> 02:29:27.290]
I wonder if he's still alive.

[02:29:27.430 --> 02:29:29.090]
You know, I wonder if he's interesting to...

[02:29:29.090 --> 02:29:30.270]
I mean, not that it's important.

[02:29:30.370 --> 02:29:33.370]
I wouldn't spend a lot of time online trying to find Buzz mush in, you know?

[02:29:34.510 --> 02:29:38.530]
Or like some of the other people from my checkered past doing stupid jobs like that.

[02:29:38.770 --> 02:29:40.570]
But it would just be interesting to know, you know?

[02:29:41.070 --> 02:29:41.750]
Oh, no, he's dead.

[02:29:41.970 --> 02:29:43.190]
And I would go like, oh, right.

[02:29:43.750 --> 02:29:44.610]
What a surprise.

[02:29:45.890 --> 02:29:48.350]
Something maybe feel the spirit of Christ can come.

[02:29:48.810 --> 02:29:49.750]
To step on church.

[02:29:49.750 --> 02:29:53.410]
A bunch of men of a white neighbor.

[02:29:54.130 --> 02:29:54.710]
A riot.

[02:29:55.270 --> 02:29:58.530]
Just like the ones I used to know.

[02:29:59.450 --> 02:30:07.110]
Where the ones were trimmed and cars had rimmed.

[02:30:07.330 --> 02:30:11.270]
It seemed so very long ago.

[02:30:14.650 --> 02:30:20.330]
I'm dreaming of a white neighbor.

[02:30:21.610 --> 02:30:25.510]
With every force inside I'll ride.

[02:30:25.510 --> 02:30:34.150]
May your days be merry and bright.

[02:30:37.670 --> 02:30:49.870]
And may all your new neighbors be white.

[02:30:53.130 --> 02:30:54.530]
By the way, what's the guy's name?

[02:30:54.730 --> 02:30:57.890]
The new times Bob Norman that wrote that crap yesterday about...

[02:30:57.890 --> 02:31:00.470]
Suffolored a self-appointed censor in the Joe Rose thing.

[02:31:00.470 --> 02:31:02.110]
And all that crap about red bone and all that.

[02:31:02.490 --> 02:31:03.250]
Hand bone.

[02:31:04.230 --> 02:31:04.810]
Seat bone.

[02:31:04.990 --> 02:31:06.790]
Connected to the seat bone and whatever.

[02:31:07.290 --> 02:31:08.670]
Bob Norman, you were an idiot, okay?

[02:31:09.070 --> 02:31:11.270]
Well, I've never agreed with Thompson before.

[02:31:11.890 --> 02:31:12.870]
But, yeah.

[02:31:14.050 --> 02:31:18.370]
In other words, glorifying him and pretend that he actually may have a legitimate point here.

[02:31:18.370 --> 02:31:20.890]
As opposed to being the perpetual Ojon Prabhakator.

[02:31:21.310 --> 02:31:23.050]
I've cut the crap, Bob Norman, whoever you are.

[02:31:23.330 --> 02:31:24.670]
Good thing nobody reads that crap anyway.

[02:31:24.790 --> 02:31:26.170]
All those handouts, publications, you know.

[02:31:26.370 --> 02:31:27.250]
Nobody reads them anyhow.

[02:31:29.630 --> 02:31:30.470]
1339 votes on the poll.

[02:31:30.570 --> 02:31:31.250]
What are I saying to Chris?

[02:31:31.370 --> 02:31:32.710]
We could have had a really shy...

[02:31:32.710 --> 02:31:33.390]
We could have had a shot.

[02:31:33.550 --> 02:31:34.770]
We could have had greatness today, man.

[02:31:35.010 --> 02:31:36.290]
Although I think we didn't achieve greatness.

[02:31:37.870 --> 02:31:38.670]
What do you call it?

[02:31:38.710 --> 02:31:40.430]
A watershed day in the history of my life today?

[02:31:40.810 --> 02:31:42.470]
That's what I called it, even though I don't know what that means.

[02:31:42.990 --> 02:31:44.450]
I don't need it, but I'll take it.

[02:31:45.490 --> 02:31:47.150]
Say watershed day in my existence.

[02:31:47.410 --> 02:31:48.850]
All the way around on the show.

[02:31:50.490 --> 02:31:51.950]
Online, offline, inline.

[02:31:52.070 --> 02:31:53.690]
I'm going to go to the store and stand, online.

[02:31:54.730 --> 02:31:56.510]
Now, is that only something I think only Jews do that.

[02:31:56.590 --> 02:31:57.930]
They stand online, New York Jews.

[02:31:58.430 --> 02:31:59.610]
Everybody else stands inline.

[02:31:59.770 --> 02:32:00.950]
But New York Jews stand online.

[02:32:01.170 --> 02:32:02.610]
I was online for half an hour.

[02:32:02.930 --> 02:32:03.590]
I've heard that before.

[02:32:04.110 --> 02:32:04.950]
Well, maybe they were Jews.

[02:32:05.110 --> 02:32:05.390]
I don't know.

[02:32:05.510 --> 02:32:06.090]
I didn't check ID.

[02:32:06.230 --> 02:32:06.730]
They were Jewish.

[02:32:09.490 --> 02:32:12.410]
I didn't Jewish stand online for half an hour.

[02:32:12.830 --> 02:32:14.810]
It depends on what's in the line.

[02:32:15.290 --> 02:32:15.990]
I have no patience.

[02:32:16.210 --> 02:32:16.590]
I have to learn.

[02:32:16.670 --> 02:32:17.210]
I have to be taught.

[02:32:17.570 --> 02:32:19.870]
Otherwise, if I don't learn to get some patience, I'm going to get a spike.

[02:32:19.990 --> 02:32:20.570]
I'm going to learn.

[02:32:20.950 --> 02:32:21.250]
Learn.

[02:32:21.370 --> 02:32:21.370]

[02:32:21.470 --> 02:32:24.150]
Get their pants pulled down and they are spanked with murals.

[02:32:24.250 --> 02:32:24.550]
Welcome.

[02:32:27.530 --> 02:32:28.530]
Oh, WQA and hello.

[02:32:29.230 --> 02:32:30.470]
They are going to have to do it.

[02:32:30.670 --> 02:32:31.070]
Yes, sir.

[02:32:31.170 --> 02:32:32.170]
Good afternoon, Mr. Colour.

[02:32:32.170 --> 02:32:32.550]
What do you got?

[02:32:33.190 --> 02:32:35.190]
Something that deserves to be on the list.

[02:32:35.190 --> 02:32:38.090]
It's truly online or kind of friends when they come in at Sforbate Season.

[02:32:38.230 --> 02:32:38.950]
I take them to it.

[02:32:38.950 --> 02:32:43.630]
It's truly the slice of 1950's Miami is the Venetian Pool, a rural game.

[02:32:43.890 --> 02:32:44.390]
The what?

[02:32:44.910 --> 02:32:46.930]
The Venetian Pool and rural game.

[02:32:47.930 --> 02:32:53.890]
It is a natural rock-poori pool that they decorate it up in 1950.

[02:32:54.230 --> 02:32:56.350]
It's a 40-50's stuff.

[02:32:56.570 --> 02:32:58.990]
It must be for anybody who's never seen it.

[02:32:59.610 --> 02:33:00.770]
I'll try to make it worse for it.

[02:33:00.810 --> 02:33:01.330]
Okay, I'll tell you.

[02:33:01.390 --> 02:33:02.090]
Don't put it on there.

[02:33:02.270 --> 02:33:03.050]
What about this kayak?

[02:33:04.950 --> 02:33:05.110]
Huh?

[02:33:05.270 --> 02:33:05.910]
What about it?

[02:33:06.190 --> 02:33:07.150]
It shouldn't be on the list.

[02:33:07.990 --> 02:33:09.390]
There's nothing wrong with the sky.

[02:33:10.070 --> 02:33:10.890]
Well, I've never been there.

[02:33:12.210 --> 02:33:14.610]
It's a big fancy house on the water there.

[02:33:15.430 --> 02:33:16.030]
It's old.

[02:33:16.230 --> 02:33:17.690]
It's got some antiques inside.

[02:33:20.550 --> 02:33:21.370]
And that's it?

[02:33:22.370 --> 02:33:25.290]
Well, I mean, there are some people that really enjoy that kind of thing.

[02:33:25.830 --> 02:33:26.830]
You know, never been down in the ground.

[02:33:27.030 --> 02:33:30.150]
There are four votes on our award-winning pool today on a great Tuesday, March 20th.

[02:33:30.710 --> 02:33:35.030]
A banner day in the history of the New York Roger Show and my life in Georgia's life and Chris.

[02:33:35.030 --> 02:33:36.470]
And everybody else out there too.

[02:33:36.810 --> 02:33:37.890]
And all the shifts at sea.

[02:33:39.590 --> 02:33:41.650]
I have no idea why, but I'm just made that up.

[02:33:42.330 --> 02:33:45.030]
1344, if someone from out of town visits out Florida,

[02:33:45.150 --> 02:33:47.190]
make sure they don't miss blank.

[02:33:47.410 --> 02:33:48.070]
That's the pool.

[02:33:48.430 --> 02:33:49.210]
They don't miss blank.

[02:33:49.350 --> 02:33:52.070]
And believe me, if they come to South Florida, they're going to get plenty of f***ing blank.

[02:33:52.910 --> 02:33:54.790]
It almost isn't up to inspire me to play.

[02:33:55.730 --> 02:33:56.470]
Gina's blank.

[02:33:57.490 --> 02:33:58.850]
As in, Gina's dead.

[02:33:59.170 --> 02:33:59.930]
Right, right.

[02:34:00.830 --> 02:34:01.570]
Gina's dead.

[02:34:01.670 --> 02:34:02.230]
But not enough.

[02:34:03.130 --> 02:34:05.350]
And no, I'm not turning on the game show channel.

[02:34:05.530 --> 02:34:05.590]
Sorry.

[02:34:06.290 --> 02:34:09.010]
Okay, the legendary New York Roger Show is leading the way.

[02:34:09.150 --> 02:34:09.670]
How do you like that?

[02:34:09.870 --> 02:34:11.130]
Boy, is that a nice pad on my back?

[02:34:11.230 --> 02:34:12.330]
I've had so many pads to them.

[02:34:12.430 --> 02:34:13.350]
I'm ready to pass out on the floor.

[02:34:15.810 --> 02:34:17.710]
I like a pad on the shoulder and a pad on the back.

[02:34:17.810 --> 02:34:19.170]
But not quite so hard, you know what I'm saying?

[02:34:20.250 --> 02:34:21.710]
Don't push me off the chair, guys.

[02:34:22.710 --> 02:34:24.370]
Legendary New York Roger Show, 353.

[02:34:24.510 --> 02:34:25.690]
Don't miss it.

[02:34:25.910 --> 02:34:27.850]
Especially now that we're actually having a real...

[02:34:27.850 --> 02:34:30.310]
You know, this is what it's going to be, baby.

[02:34:30.450 --> 02:34:31.530]
Right now, I'm coming to that right now.

[02:34:31.530 --> 02:34:33.410]
And I don't care how many times George gives me.

[02:34:33.530 --> 02:34:35.630]
Oh, you need to go back to reading a whole bunch of bedtime.

[02:34:36.170 --> 02:34:37.250]
I'll read a couple here and there.

[02:34:37.430 --> 02:34:39.370]
I'll slip one in, you know, when you least expect it.

[02:34:39.530 --> 02:34:40.070]
But I'm banged.

[02:34:40.110 --> 02:34:41.050]
Here you go, like that.

[02:34:41.290 --> 02:34:42.290]
I'll slip one of those in your shoe.

[02:34:43.370 --> 02:34:45.070]
I would advise them not to come to South Florida.

[02:34:45.610 --> 02:34:46.370]
339, including me.

[02:34:46.430 --> 02:34:47.330]
That would be my best advice.

[02:34:47.710 --> 02:34:48.610]
Don't do it, please.

[02:34:49.930 --> 02:34:52.290]
Like that story that William Holden was telling at the beginning of the

[02:34:52.290 --> 02:34:54.230]
network when they're getting drunk at the bar, him and Howard Beale.

[02:34:54.790 --> 02:34:57.450]
And he says, hey, can't be taken into the foot of the George Washington Bridge.

[02:34:57.550 --> 02:34:58.370]
Remember, he was doing a remote.

[02:34:59.030 --> 02:35:00.630]
And the cab driver says, don't do it, pal.

[02:35:00.630 --> 02:35:02.230]
You got your whole life idea, pal.

[02:35:04.390 --> 02:35:05.870]
South Beach 269.

[02:35:06.530 --> 02:35:08.270]
Don't miss your outbound flight, 111.

[02:35:08.410 --> 02:35:10.670]
Whatever you do, that's in fact, jump on the wing.

[02:35:11.190 --> 02:35:12.470]
You know, that expression of wing in a prayer.

[02:35:12.730 --> 02:35:14.850]
I would jump on the wing if that's what it took to get out of there.

[02:35:16.550 --> 02:35:19.190]
Can you believe how stupid I was when I left my winter coat?

[02:35:19.290 --> 02:35:21.130]
I told you that story last time I came back up here.

[02:35:22.650 --> 02:35:25.290]
I was so depressed standing there in the checkout line.

[02:35:25.490 --> 02:35:29.190]
You know, and I'm thinking to myself, all the times that I flown back and forth

[02:35:29.190 --> 02:35:30.410]
from here down there and back.

[02:35:30.770 --> 02:35:32.590]
And generally, you're taking consideration.

[02:35:32.590 --> 02:35:34.330]
It's 7580 degrees down there.

[02:35:34.590 --> 02:35:37.610]
And it's like a zero up here, you know, or like maybe a 25.

[02:35:39.250 --> 02:35:40.350]
Or maybe if you're lucky.

[02:35:41.450 --> 02:35:42.710]
And I'm standing there.

[02:35:42.890 --> 02:35:47.050]
I felt I just wanted to sit down on the floor and put my head in my hands and cry.

[02:35:47.290 --> 02:35:49.430]
Have you ever had that feeling? Well, probably you every day.

[02:35:49.870 --> 02:35:49.870]

[02:35:51.450 --> 02:35:51.570]
Oh.

[02:35:53.850 --> 02:35:55.330]
The routebound flight 111.

[02:35:55.390 --> 02:35:56.330]
I hate this pool 65.

[02:35:56.330 --> 02:35:58.690]
I mean, it's 75 or 4.8%. That's pretty good. They like it.

[02:35:59.070 --> 02:36:00.750]
And we didn't even ask it to begin in the show today.

[02:36:00.990 --> 02:36:01.630]
You like it?

[02:36:01.990 --> 02:36:03.730]
But we should do that from now on.

[02:36:05.230 --> 02:36:07.990]
Not that I'll pay any attention. There's whatever we want to do.

[02:36:08.410 --> 02:36:10.130]
Sog rest mills mall. Don't miss it, man.

[02:36:10.350 --> 02:36:13.610]
40 votes for the Sog rest mills mall. It's an attraction.

[02:36:14.050 --> 02:36:15.710]
Why, Neil? I haven't got any idea.

[02:36:17.030 --> 02:36:19.470]
You could throw a rock from my house to the Sog rest mills mall.

[02:36:19.590 --> 02:36:20.590]
In fact, if you're smart, you would.

[02:36:21.630 --> 02:36:23.410]
Little Havana 36. Don't miss that.

[02:36:24.230 --> 02:36:25.610]
That'll make you get on Zip Lane.

[02:36:26.770 --> 02:36:27.950]
Early bird dinner is got.

[02:36:28.270 --> 02:36:29.290]
About 30, man.

[02:36:30.110 --> 02:36:31.470]
The Jungle Queen dinner cruise 28.

[02:36:31.790 --> 02:36:33.190]
Now, let me ask you something about the early bird.

[02:36:33.310 --> 02:36:36.010]
Are as many places offered it as they used to know that all the old Jews are dead?

[02:36:36.630 --> 02:36:37.310]
You're asking us.

[02:36:38.050 --> 02:36:41.430]
Well, I mean, just general opinion. I mean, you get around town a little bit.

[02:36:42.230 --> 02:36:42.870]
As far as I know.

[02:36:43.850 --> 02:36:45.850]
You know, the thing about old people, they keep making more.

[02:36:46.310 --> 02:36:47.750]
That's right. Don't tell me.

[02:36:48.770 --> 02:36:50.270]
The Jungle Queen dinner cruise 28.

[02:36:50.270 --> 02:36:52.030]
Now, you guys out there. Don't ever get old.

[02:36:52.290 --> 02:36:54.770]
That's my best advice. Believe me. Take my advice.

[02:36:55.570 --> 02:36:57.870]
My Kai 22, Cemetery Village 21.

[02:36:58.190 --> 02:37:00.390]
How does the My Kai even qualify as a tourist attraction?

[02:37:00.750 --> 02:37:03.530]
I know they got the, you know, the Polynesians show and all the glitzy.

[02:37:03.770 --> 02:37:05.490]
Right, they got the garden there and...

[02:37:05.490 --> 02:37:07.350]
Yeah, that. I hear garden My Ass.

[02:37:07.570 --> 02:37:10.370]
The Jungle get a rake. Maybe a hoe.

[02:37:10.810 --> 02:37:12.570]
Maybe I can be like Moa. I can get raked in it.

[02:37:13.750 --> 02:37:16.370]
My Kai 22, Cemetery Village 21.

[02:37:16.790 --> 02:37:19.130]
The Metro Zoo where you'll find the Amchus Juan McGill.

[02:37:19.130 --> 02:37:20.470]
Well, you know, I never played that open.

[02:37:21.110 --> 02:37:24.210]
I don't know why. Probably because the Chris would have never sprained down.

[02:37:24.950 --> 02:37:26.670]
The one in two hours, the one we run McGill.

[02:37:26.690 --> 02:37:29.450]
This is round McGill from Amchus, and I listen to that.

[02:37:29.550 --> 02:37:30.590]
You know, Rodgers, one in two hours.

[02:37:30.890 --> 02:37:32.510]
Hell, let's eat better than sex with the animals.

[02:37:34.850 --> 02:37:36.510]
When I was with all the sound effects here,

[02:37:36.570 --> 02:37:38.910]
I'd never be a thunk about it before. Who'da thunk it?

[02:37:40.230 --> 02:37:42.910]
Um, Metro Zoo 19, Monkey Jungle 12, speaking of that.

[02:37:43.090 --> 02:37:45.890]
And a parrot jungle only for so-called Quattro.

[02:37:46.290 --> 02:37:47.250]
So, Tonto Quattro.

[02:37:48.550 --> 02:37:50.450]
How come it can be Quattro and Uno?

[02:37:50.650 --> 02:37:52.990]
How come the Italians and the Spaniards could give...

[02:37:52.990 --> 02:37:54.890]
Yeah, how come they could agree on two numbers there?

[02:37:55.630 --> 02:37:57.770]
Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh?

[02:37:57.770 --> 02:37:58.770]
I don't know. Huh?

[02:37:59.090 --> 02:38:00.430]
Oh, what's the guy who did with Joseph Gacchi?

[02:38:00.550 --> 02:38:01.730]
I had the wrong button. I was trying to say...

[02:38:01.730 --> 02:38:07.150]
How come Uno and Quattro?

[02:38:07.890 --> 02:38:09.350]
Cinco and Cinque? Huh?

[02:38:09.790 --> 02:38:10.690]
Trace and Tray?

[02:38:11.110 --> 02:38:11.250]
Yeah.

[02:38:11.250 --> 02:38:13.730]
Duo, uh, those and, uh, do we?

[02:38:13.970 --> 02:38:14.730]
Nive and Nive.

[02:38:14.730 --> 02:38:15.130]
Oh, then.

[02:38:16.090 --> 02:38:17.230]
Oh, to Metro Zoo?

[02:38:18.410 --> 02:38:18.930]
Mm-hmm.

[02:38:20.730 --> 02:38:21.370]
Sea and...

[02:38:21.370 --> 02:38:21.670]
No.

[02:38:24.030 --> 02:38:25.810]
Twenty before two, you see this?

[02:38:26.030 --> 02:38:27.010]
Twenty till two or QA.

[02:38:27.030 --> 02:38:27.330]
Hey, hold on.

[02:38:27.850 --> 02:38:29.690]
I feel in coherence today. I don't know what it is.

[02:38:29.790 --> 02:38:31.990]
This hasn't been a show today.

[02:38:32.130 --> 02:38:33.630]
This whole thing has been like an experience.

[02:38:33.990 --> 02:38:34.730]
Did it really happen?

[02:38:35.170 --> 02:38:35.770]
No, I mean by that?

[02:38:35.950 --> 02:38:36.130]
No.

[02:38:37.550 --> 02:38:40.790]
I don't think I do either. That's your gonna wake up and you're gonna have to show all the...

[02:38:40.790 --> 02:38:42.830]
Third, yeah. I'm gonna wake up and realize it's like seven in the morning.

[02:38:42.830 --> 02:38:44.530]
I gotta get up now and get ready to do all this.

[02:38:44.810 --> 02:38:46.830]
And do this and do that. And it's only Tuesday.

[02:38:47.110 --> 02:38:51.010]
The good news is Thursday, another mile I gave it 12.50. Oh yeah.

[02:38:51.050 --> 02:38:51.270]
Ow!

[02:38:52.850 --> 02:38:54.650]
It's been good for my internship at the...

[02:38:54.650 --> 02:38:55.890]
You're ratings are dying now.

[02:38:56.950 --> 02:39:00.630]
Well, I don't wanna show you what a fake ass said I was to your hand-house.

[02:39:00.850 --> 02:39:01.210]
Rectums?

[02:39:01.490 --> 02:39:04.450]
Yes, does your good fight somebody good enough to film my begging pants?

[02:39:05.410 --> 02:39:06.370]
Are you mean easy?

[02:39:09.070 --> 02:39:09.430]
Huh?

[02:39:10.190 --> 02:39:12.630]
Very no chance I'll let it be coming back.

[02:39:14.150 --> 02:39:16.210]
I'm excited considering a lucrative act.

[02:39:17.670 --> 02:39:21.430]
If you wanna know what it'll say if I'm shutting that transmitter to the lounge...

[02:39:22.330 --> 02:39:22.730]
Why?

[02:39:22.910 --> 02:39:23.450]
That's easy.

[02:39:26.050 --> 02:39:26.610]
Sure.

[02:39:27.470 --> 02:39:29.270]
Oh, you need a smile.

[02:39:30.490 --> 02:39:31.930]
I think I'm gonna wake up.

[02:39:32.210 --> 02:39:34.010]
Oh, you need a smile.

[02:39:35.010 --> 02:39:36.790]
I'm gonna wake up.

[02:39:36.790 --> 02:39:38.730]
Oh, you need a smile.

[02:39:39.210 --> 02:39:39.950]
I don't know.

[02:39:41.010 --> 02:39:42.150]
I don't know.

[02:39:43.770 --> 02:39:47.590]
I think your old dreams last only got to the day.

[02:39:48.090 --> 02:39:51.990]
I think that my ratings have bottomed out in the night.

[02:39:52.450 --> 02:39:56.590]
And I think I'll have to re-loathe these two of them today and civil wars.

[02:39:57.150 --> 02:40:01.270]
And we did...

[02:40:01.270 --> 02:40:03.690]
That's what you need to know.

[02:40:04.270 --> 02:40:05.190]
Now we're drinking.

[02:40:06.130 --> 02:40:08.050]
Oh, you need a smile.

[02:40:08.870 --> 02:40:09.750]
I don't know.

[02:40:09.750 --> 02:40:10.290]
Oh, you need a smile.

[02:40:10.870 --> 02:40:12.810]
Oh, you need a smile.

[02:40:13.150 --> 02:40:13.290]
Oh, you need a smile.

[02:40:18.430 --> 02:40:19.930]
You fight away something.

[02:40:20.350 --> 02:40:21.790]
You can't hold me to give me this.

[02:40:21.990 --> 02:40:22.610]
You see?

[02:40:22.930 --> 02:40:24.430]
What the hell?

[02:40:24.790 --> 02:40:25.830]
Are you gonna go fight me?

[02:40:27.070 --> 02:40:28.050]
On the moon?

[02:40:28.450 --> 02:40:30.310]
Nerds get their pants pulled down a mare.

[02:40:30.550 --> 02:40:31.610]
Spank with Murat.

[02:40:31.610 --> 02:40:32.610]
Okay, 14 go through.

[02:40:32.710 --> 02:40:34.590]
I can't wait for that 1360 people.

[02:40:34.670 --> 02:40:37.490]
It's man, Chris, you really missed a golden opportunity.

[02:40:37.830 --> 02:40:38.490]
I apologize.

[02:40:39.210 --> 02:40:41.210]
We could have another day just like last Monday.

[02:40:41.290 --> 02:40:45.550]
Remember last Monday when we had 1500 and some odd votes and I do underline the odd part on a show.

[02:40:45.810 --> 02:40:46.470]
And we were going nuts.

[02:40:46.850 --> 02:40:47.470]
I was going nuts.

[02:40:47.810 --> 02:40:48.970]
I think that was the beginning of the day.

[02:40:49.190 --> 02:40:50.190]
Turn around, so to speak.

[02:40:50.670 --> 02:40:50.990]
Turn around.

[02:40:51.310 --> 02:40:52.050]
Back your pants.

[02:40:52.170 --> 02:40:52.490]
Back down.

[02:40:52.630 --> 02:40:53.090]
And go to the moon.

[02:40:53.650 --> 02:40:55.050]
Or just moon the audience.

[02:40:57.030 --> 02:40:59.450]
Boy, this, this, uh, whoever is sending us all these stories,

[02:40:59.450 --> 02:41:00.030]
I don't know.

[02:41:00.210 --> 02:41:00.770]
Working overtime.

[02:41:00.850 --> 02:41:01.210]
And that's good.

[02:41:01.330 --> 02:41:02.070]
I like these stories.

[02:41:03.990 --> 02:41:05.330]
Driver's sex charge is added.

[02:41:05.630 --> 02:41:07.630]
In diamond brought back against priest as well.

[02:41:08.190 --> 02:41:08.830]
Covington, Kentucky.

[02:41:09.210 --> 02:41:10.310]
Oh, that's a place you don't want to be.

[02:41:11.070 --> 02:41:12.650]
Or is this, and I'm sure it must be.

[02:41:13.830 --> 02:41:15.430]
This says Cincinnati.com.

[02:41:16.430 --> 02:41:17.690]
But isn't Covington and Kentucky?

[02:41:17.930 --> 02:41:18.290]
Yes, it is.

[02:41:18.350 --> 02:41:18.650]
I don't know.

[02:41:19.030 --> 02:41:19.550]
It is.

[02:41:19.750 --> 02:41:20.070]
You never know.

[02:41:20.450 --> 02:41:20.970]
Yes, it is.

[02:41:21.050 --> 02:41:22.030]
Remember, yes, it is by the Beatles.

[02:41:22.150 --> 02:41:23.830]
That was the flip side of something really good.

[02:41:24.950 --> 02:41:25.790]
Was that the flip side of yesterday?

[02:41:26.250 --> 02:41:26.650]
Yes, it is.

[02:41:28.090 --> 02:41:29.450]
You don't have that by the Beatles?

[02:41:29.790 --> 02:41:30.250]
By the Beatles?

[02:41:30.530 --> 02:41:31.010]
Yes, it is.

[02:41:31.990 --> 02:41:33.070]
Well, let's hear it.

[02:41:33.190 --> 02:41:33.890]
That's a great song.

[02:41:33.910 --> 02:41:35.010]
And why this thing isn't working.

[02:41:35.170 --> 02:41:35.790]
Yeah, kick it.

[02:41:35.990 --> 02:41:37.150]
Smack it a little bit, okay?

[02:41:38.430 --> 02:41:39.570]
Spank it with moon rocks.

[02:41:40.510 --> 02:41:40.990]
That'd be nice.

[02:41:41.390 --> 02:41:45.710]

[02:42:27.850 --> 02:42:29.250]
Don't tell me there's more of this.

[02:42:29.310 --> 02:42:32.110]

[02:43:01.790 --> 02:43:02.290]
Oh, no.

[02:43:03.290 --> 02:43:04.690]
When does it ever stop?

[02:43:04.850 --> 02:43:05.990]
Will it ever stop, huh?

[02:43:06.150 --> 02:43:08.690]
Father, you have to know all the boys.

[02:43:08.850 --> 02:43:09.470]
No chance.

[02:43:10.990 --> 02:43:15.270]

Maybe he was just rick and a soda pop.

[02:43:25.110 --> 02:43:28.630]
Spoons and crack pipes and leather bag between the front seats as well as black and white

[02:43:28.630 --> 02:43:30.270]
photographs of well-endowed men.

[02:43:31.890 --> 02:43:32.690]
Oh, wow.

[02:43:33.510 --> 02:43:34.750]
Put all those things together.

[02:43:34.910 --> 02:43:35.370]
What do you guys?

[02:43:35.450 --> 02:43:36.110]
All of these things.

[02:43:37.370 --> 02:43:40.950]
He was also indicted on one kind of possession of drug paraphernalia, a misdemeanor.

[02:43:41.850 --> 02:43:43.030]
Pictures of well-endowed men.

[02:43:43.030 --> 02:43:44.970]
Black and white photos, though, not full color.

[02:43:45.990 --> 02:43:49.190]
Gakey was arrested January 8th by members of the Northern Kentucky Drug Strike Force

[02:43:49.190 --> 02:43:51.170]
outside the Hampton Inn in Covington.

[02:43:51.430 --> 02:43:52.910]
He told police you now lives in Tampa.

[02:43:53.490 --> 02:43:53.970]
All right.

[02:43:54.350 --> 02:43:56.850]
He had previously served as pastor of two churches in Dayton, Ohio.

[02:43:57.510 --> 02:44:01.470]
Narcotics agents responding to a tip watch as Gakey left his hotel room with two other men.

[02:44:01.890 --> 02:44:03.330]
Oh, what were they doing in that room, huh?

[02:44:03.430 --> 02:44:04.330]
A father.

[02:44:05.030 --> 02:44:07.770]
When the three got into his car, the agents approached and asked him to get out.

[02:44:08.210 --> 02:44:09.310]
Gakey remains free on bond.

[02:44:09.310 --> 02:44:11.810]
He'll be arrained in Kent and Circuit Court today.

[02:44:12.470 --> 02:44:16.730]
Before Judge Stephen Yeager or is that Yeager as in Yarmory, Yager?

[02:44:16.810 --> 02:44:17.370]
I don't think so.

[02:44:17.790 --> 02:44:18.870]
Let's have some hockey talk.

[02:44:19.010 --> 02:44:19.290]
What do you say?

[02:44:20.210 --> 02:44:21.270]
Let's get rumor on the phone.

[02:44:21.330 --> 02:44:22.090]
Do a hockey show.

[02:44:22.170 --> 02:44:22.330]
No.

[02:44:22.530 --> 02:44:23.590]
And that's another good thing.

[02:44:23.690 --> 02:44:25.030]
Not only don't we see fat boy anymore.

[02:44:25.230 --> 02:44:26.850]
That's another reason I'm in such a good mood today.

[02:44:27.070 --> 02:44:28.470]
You know who else I never hear from anymore?

[02:44:29.310 --> 02:44:29.490]
Rimmer?

[02:44:29.990 --> 02:44:30.930]
Ever, ever here.

[02:44:31.230 --> 02:44:33.010]
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.

[02:44:33.090 --> 02:44:34.410]
In other words, if it's free, it's me.

[02:44:34.450 --> 02:44:34.610]
All right.

[02:44:35.950 --> 02:44:37.050]
Well, that's really good news.

[02:44:37.310 --> 02:44:38.490]
13th and 167 votes.

[02:44:38.490 --> 02:44:41.790]
You see, we really, I mean, we're going to be on the edge of 14 as it is.

[02:44:41.790 --> 02:44:46.850]
Now, without the big push, I mean, we're certainly not going to get 33 votes in nine minutes.

[02:44:48.090 --> 02:44:50.410]
But we're going to be right on the precipice, man.

[02:44:50.530 --> 02:44:52.710]
Right on the edge of such phenomenal greatness.

[02:44:53.050 --> 02:44:54.190]
This isn't just legendary.

[02:44:54.310 --> 02:44:56.030]
This is almost unspeakable, you know what?

[02:44:56.250 --> 02:44:59.310]
It's almost like a religious experience that you arrived at your show.

[02:44:59.450 --> 02:45:00.110]
That's what they say.

[02:45:00.170 --> 02:45:00.670]
They're good.

[02:45:01.170 --> 02:45:01.570]
And they do.

[02:45:01.770 --> 02:45:03.430]
That's KNEEL, do you?

[02:45:03.870 --> 02:45:04.410]
They kneel.

[02:45:06.030 --> 02:45:08.810]
That's why leading on the pool out of 1367 votes.

[02:45:08.810 --> 02:45:13.530]
If someone from out of town visits out for them, make sure they don't miss the legendary Near Rogers show.

[02:45:14.470 --> 02:45:14.790]
355.

[02:45:14.990 --> 02:45:18.110]
Over a quarter of the respondents are like tinkling all over my leg.

[02:45:18.930 --> 02:45:20.590]
Excuse me while I go get a towel, please.

[02:45:20.710 --> 02:45:21.270]
Just like that duck.

[02:45:21.330 --> 02:45:22.370]
Too bad we can't play that anymore.

[02:45:23.190 --> 02:45:24.770]
Just stop and think about all the great things you've done.

[02:45:24.910 --> 02:45:25.910]
I do sometimes I do.

[02:45:26.010 --> 02:45:26.730]
And I show it to be five.

[02:45:26.890 --> 02:45:28.370]
Even more than I out normally to.

[02:45:28.490 --> 02:45:28.650]
Yeah.

[02:45:29.250 --> 02:45:34.910]
Anyway, here's the fact that it says having played tour guide for many of his interviewer sky is a must see for those who want to.

[02:45:34.930 --> 02:45:35.890]
Did we put this guy on there?

[02:45:36.010 --> 02:45:36.310]
Why not?

[02:45:36.870 --> 02:45:37.930]
Some cultural history.

[02:45:38.050 --> 02:45:38.150]
Sure.

[02:45:38.550 --> 02:45:40.130]
The gardens are as beautiful as the house.

[02:45:40.350 --> 02:45:41.310]
The gardens are very beautiful.

[02:45:42.930 --> 02:45:47.530]
Apedition pool is also very historical and cool to see, but probably around five on a top ten list.

[02:45:47.870 --> 02:45:49.230]
The sky it says it would put number two.

[02:45:49.870 --> 02:45:51.750]
The new parachungal is a sham attourist trap.

[02:45:52.090 --> 02:45:55.490]
Whereas the old parachungal was pretty cool since, says, whoever this is.

[02:45:55.770 --> 02:45:56.530]
Well, thank you very much.

[02:45:57.850 --> 02:45:59.110]
Thank you so very much.

[02:46:01.430 --> 02:46:04.170]
The new parachungal is, you know, for the birds.

[02:46:05.550 --> 02:46:08.090]
I still would like to see a macaul once again before I die.

[02:46:08.470 --> 02:46:15.110]
Now, when you go into the trap of Canada, the point I was trying to make before, is that when you go across, you know how they have those walkways like from the MGM grand.

[02:46:15.550 --> 02:46:17.630]
And you go right across and you're like in the trap of Canada.

[02:46:17.930 --> 02:46:20.590]
And you walk through the lobby in there and you've got all those parrots.

[02:46:21.630 --> 02:46:21.950]
Right.

[02:46:22.270 --> 02:46:25.250]
They just hang out on those, what do you call those things?

[02:46:26.450 --> 02:46:26.770]
Parrots?

[02:46:27.230 --> 02:46:29.470]
No, no, but they hang out on those wooden things.

[02:46:29.510 --> 02:46:30.650]
They just branch with perch?

[02:46:30.830 --> 02:46:31.930]
Yeah, they're on a perch.

[02:46:32.110 --> 02:46:32.650]
That's it, perch.

[02:46:32.650 --> 02:46:36.970]
And those of us go fishing in, and like the French say, perch on this is Jompazze.

[02:46:37.110 --> 02:46:37.810]
That's what the French say.

[02:46:37.910 --> 02:46:38.650]
They hold up that middle finger.

[02:46:39.250 --> 02:46:39.570]
Jompazze.

[02:46:39.770 --> 02:46:43.150]
That's why you don't want to ever go to Frick Paris too many freaking Frenchmen.

[02:47:04.490 --> 02:47:05.750]
What's they doing?

[02:47:09.470 --> 02:47:10.790]
What's they doing?

[02:47:13.430 --> 02:47:16.750]
Bonds, my piece of been, sub been, sub been.

[02:47:17.150 --> 02:47:19.650]
Past the inspectors.

[02:47:23.430 --> 02:47:26.750]
Bonds, my piece of been, sub been, sub been.

[02:47:27.370 --> 02:47:29.650]
Past the inspectors.

[02:47:32.650 --> 02:47:35.310]
Don't want to fly without Kite.

[02:47:37.130 --> 02:47:37.790]
Overseas.

[02:47:38.390 --> 02:47:40.290]
Fly without Kite.

[02:47:40.610 --> 02:47:42.610]
I'll be thrown this with a breeze.

[02:47:42.870 --> 02:47:44.650]
Don't want to fly without Kite.

[02:47:45.390 --> 02:47:46.370]
But I know the air.

[02:47:46.590 --> 02:47:47.530]
Oh, no, not me.

[02:47:48.810 --> 02:47:51.570]
I'm not in the ocean.

[02:47:53.630 --> 02:47:54.290]
Pakistanis.

[02:47:55.550 --> 02:47:58.930]
I'm covered in nasty, nitric listening.

[02:48:00.150 --> 02:48:02.390]
And a tube of dense stream.

[02:48:03.070 --> 02:48:07.390]
Mix it up and, boy, bake some TNT.

[02:48:08.810 --> 02:48:11.510]
Oh, no, that's no solution.

[02:48:13.010 --> 02:48:15.230]
Don't want to fly without Kite.

[02:48:15.890 --> 02:48:17.410]
The OAC.

[02:48:18.650 --> 02:48:20.170]
Fly without Kite.

[02:48:20.350 --> 02:48:22.470]
There'll be nothing left of me.

[02:48:22.770 --> 02:48:25.170]
Don't want to fly without Kite.

[02:48:26.090 --> 02:48:27.550]
Wait and see.

[02:48:28.550 --> 02:48:32.070]
I'm mine and I'm in the ocean.

[02:48:34.510 --> 02:48:37.250]
And welcome to Heathrow International Airport.

[02:48:37.990 --> 02:48:43.270]

[02:48:45.550 --> 02:48:47.810]

You're meeting checkpoint for the aircraft.

[02:48:52.730 --> 02:48:59.570]
As includes beverages, champs, mobion, sand lotion, toothpaste,

[02:49:00.730 --> 02:49:03.810]
bedroom, and other items of similar consistency.

[02:49:05.790 --> 02:49:09.450]
Thank you for your attention and enjoy your flight.

[02:49:09.870 --> 02:49:10.670]
Bye, bye, bye!
