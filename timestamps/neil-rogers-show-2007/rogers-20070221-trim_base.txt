[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.040]
I have howling!

[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.880]
I'm behind insisting they're not taking

[00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.100]
You've got to hide your heart away

[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.340]
You've got to hide your heart away

[00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.320]
Now we'll start an ugly battle

[00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.220]
So sad straights, gang will buy

[00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.800]
Men who fall of all men

[00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.800]
Is a sword for Satan, my young young

[00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.560]
No, girls, you're just cold for queer

[00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.040]
Having fun with the boys

[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.420]
In the lots of room I hear

[00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.040]
Boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy

[00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.320]
Boy, boy, boy, boy

[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.600]
You've got to hide your heart away

[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:43.800]
You've got to hide your heart away

[00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.260]
You've just hide it away

[00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.160]
One more time, 10-0-2-5-16-W

[00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.840]
The Q&A Wednesday boys and girls

[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.120]
Tomorrow is Washington's birthday

[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.180]
And today is Ask Wednesday

[00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.540]
I forgot to draw an ass on my forehead

[00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.800]
Oh no, let's get out those ashes baby

[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.580]
Let's start smearing and smearing

[00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:06.780]
Like the right wingers do

[00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.300]
Oh see, I thought I was all over that

[00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.660]
I have just a little tad, a little tiny bit

[00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:12.660]
Today is the final day

[00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.100]
Give out of my system of woodbind

[00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.960]
It's woodbind Wednesday

[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.420]
Gonna find me a good machine

[00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.680]
And I'm gonna go and smear some ashes on my forehead

[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:20.780]
Wouldn't that be a good idea?

[00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:22.320]
Could only help?

[00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.140]
I mean, it just makes me weak

[00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.560]
When I start thinking about those things

[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.060]
That's why I don't think about them very much

[00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.680]
About these things that people do

[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:31.580]
All these things

[00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.200]
All these things, all the trappings

[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.680]
All the trappings in the crappings

[00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.300]
Maybe the religious nuts, yeah

[00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.640]
Oh, you've got to smear the ashes on your forehead

[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.300]
And what's that supposed to do if you smear it?

[00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:44.580]
It's supposed to show everyone

[00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.360]
How pious you are compared to them

[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.320]
I see, how much better of a person you are obviously

[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.620]
God likes me better see

[00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.420]
And isn't this the beginning of length?

[00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.960]
That's what I'm told

[00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:55.000]
I see

[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.540]
Well, what is this Sunday?

[00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.760]
Because Easter Sunday is April 8th

[00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.200]
What is this Sunday? Anything special?

[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.320]
Look and I don't see anything written on there

[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.360]
Oh, well, what do you mean you're a saintly written?

[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.240]
You were a good Catholic boy, why don't you put it on these things?

[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.540]
No, it's not a good Catholic boy

[00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.260]
I mean, bad Catholic boy

[00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.440]
He then banstered you

[00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:13.880]
So it's Ash Wednesday

[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.020]
And we've got poor him coming up

[00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.780]
For all the humantation lovers out there

[00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.860]
And we've got Easter and Pace-Auch

[00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.340]
I had some mushroom barley soup yesterday

[00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:23.620]
Remember I was going to have months of all soup

[00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.220]
And they do have that, but then I asked what's the soup today

[00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.700]
And they said mushroom barley and I went

[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.960]
Mmm, oh man

[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.560]
That is my very favorite

[00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.120]
This you just love mushroom barley soup

[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.160]
I do, I love it a lot, I wish we could have some right now

[00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.300]
Yeah, I wish I had a big bowl full right now

[00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:39.200]
Just like a van

[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.280]
Well, I wish I had a bowl full

[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.200]
We have an update

[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.080]
Yes, internet's back

[00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.620]
Oh, the internet is back and now we got our dots

[00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:48.560]
Look at that, the phones working

[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.620]
There's the evidence right there

[00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.000]
The internet was out for a little while

[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.140]
Now, what about our streaming? No, we don't have any dropouts

[00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:55.420]
Well, I'm sure we have dropouts

[00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.140]
But that's not unusual

[00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:59.960]
But we have no dropouts

[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.220]
So everything is A-OK

[00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:02.860]
Nice culinary engineering staff

[00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.380]
They really got right on that today

[00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.820]
And that's because I'm sure that Josh Cordis was in there

[00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:08.200]
Eating more free food

[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.260]
Is that what he's in there for?

[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.040]
And the good company

[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.700]
Right, that's correct

[00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.180]
He still wishes you know when you were out on Friday

[00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:18.280]
Nursing Your Sick family

[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.500]
Yes, and I asked him if he had his brothers

[00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.260]
If they would pay him the same

[00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.720]
That he's getting paid now to do the Q&M website

[00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.220]
To still be on our show

[00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.000]
Which would he do?

[00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:29.520]
And of course it was a no-brainer

[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.160]
He said, oh, of course I'd rather be on a show

[00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.420]
So he's desperate to interact with us

[00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:36.040]
Because he knows that we love him

[00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.780]
And he loves us

[00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.400]
Yeah, God forbid they should pay people what they're worth to work on this show

[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.240]
British Prime Minister Tony Blair

[00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:42.900]
Yesterday or today

[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.260]
I don't understand how that can be today

[00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:46.740]
I know there are five hours ahead over there

[00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.760]
But nevertheless, announced plans to withdraw

[00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.700]
1600 of his country's troops from Iraq

[00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.500]
You remember the British are coming?

[00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:54.300]
The British are leaving

[00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:55.460]
Okay

[00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.360]
And the statement to lawmakers in the House of Commons

[00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.420]
Blair said British troop numbers will be reduced from 7,200 to 5,500 in the coming months

[00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:02.120]
But only

[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.460]
Only if Iraqi security forces could secure the southern part of their country

[00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:08.100]
Mm-hmm

[00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.280]
Blair said British troops will increase in replay

[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.660]
And support global Iraqi forces assuming responsibility for security operations

[00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.540]
The next chapter in Boswiss history

[00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:17.600]
will be written by Iraqis Blair said

[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:18.540]
Tony Blair

[00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.720]
Wednesday's announcement came after Blair on Sunday declared that the British

[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.060]
Michigan Boswiss and Southern Iraq

[00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:28.180]
Can code name Sinbad has been completed and successful

[00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:29.220]
All right

[00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:30.740]
We should accomplish baby

[00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:32.700]
Just like his partner in crime

[00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:33.720]
Blair and Bush

[00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:36.740]
Well, when I get to today's poll man

[00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:38.480]
It's going to take a half hour to read each time

[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.120]
It'll be a good kill some excellent time

[00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.380]
Here's yesterday's poll

[00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:44.080]
And of course George is not

[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.060]
George is going to be all kinds of crap about the polls

[00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:47.180]
Like the one for tomorrow

[00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.380]
So I like the idea that I had what disease do you miss the most

[00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:51.800]
And I'm voting for Ricketts

[00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:55.120]
We could say disease or condition I think

[00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:59.200]
Isn't he always belly aching about having to come up with a poll idea Chris?

[00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:00.460]
Isn't that his number one objection?

[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.780]
Yeah, that doesn't mean that any idea is a good idea

[00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:05.400]
Although yeah

[00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.240]
Aren't you the guy that did the poll

[00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.360]
The poll question was what

[00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.380]
Yeah, or which

[00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:15.120]
Because they don't they don't answer the question anyway they always make up their own okay

[00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:19.620]
Whatever you say here's the poll from yesterday too late to change it's all done 1335 votes

[00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:22.140]
The thing I hate most about growing old is

[00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:24.900]
I won't be able to afford to live 293

[00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.080]
Young chicks won't like me anymore 178

[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.600]
I'm not worried about either one of those two

[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.520]
The winky won't work 149

[00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:33.700]
Well, I'm not worried about that yet

[00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:35.640]
Have a week step point yet

[00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.780]
I am old 121

[00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:41.560]
Yes 9% of the audience see and George just think it all you've got nothing about all these old parts

[00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:44.680]
9% of audiences that we are old what?

[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:46.220]
I'm one of them

[00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:47.660]
You're gonna what old fart fart

[00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:49.980]
Hair growing in my ears 119

[00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:51.400]
That is a very serious problem

[00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:57.260]
I clipped in the yanked and twisted in my ears to this morning 119 hair growing in the ears

[00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:59.020]
Everything droops 114

[00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:01.280]
Getting close to death 92

[00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:05.980]
A lot of people are worried that their hair and that their head is going to like start getting a squawse

[00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:10.900]
After one side like that purple guy the medical examiner see I didn't even increase his assistance that time

[00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:12.680]
Are you proud of me?

[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:13.460]
No you're learning

[00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:17.520]
Getting close to that 92 I hate this pull 91 6.8%

[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:19.380]
That's typical sour out response

[00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:22.780]
Too many sour candies it lets us a sour response

[00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:24.880]
Nothing I'm looking forward to getting old 90

[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:28.240]
Those people need to be put away for a long time

[00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:29.380]
Until they get really old

[00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:30.940]
I poop my pants 74

[00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:31.880]
A lot of fun

[00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:35.820]
And my kids will stick me in a home only 14 people worried about that

[00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:39.080]
I think a lot of people out there wish that somebody would put him in a home

[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:45.120]
Everybody takes care of you know you have all the health care and everybody comes and they give you a little pat on the back of the head

[00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:46.640]
Oh I shaved my head this morning

[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:48.760]
Good I feel smooth

[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:52.140]
I feel just like Shrine head O'Connor I shaved it so close

[00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:52.980]
Or Brittany

[00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:56.460]
Or yeah or Brittany I think I do a little bit better job than Brittany

[00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:58.120]
She's just a rank beginner

[00:07:58.120 --> 00:07:59.540]
I do underline the word rank

[00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:01.000]
Here's today's pull

[00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:03.240]
745 votes

[00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:07.980]
We'll get to our thousand when I sat down here was like 5 something Chris said oh you're never gonna make a thousand a meal

[00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:09.220]
Then you say that? No

[00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:11.460]
He don't dare say that

[00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:13.560]
Here's the pull

[00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:15.520]
What is the be- this is interesting

[00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:16.700]
Marginally

[00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:20.100]
What is the reaction you get when you tell others that you listen to Neil?

[00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:24.280]
And it's not my pull and I didn't add anything to it

[00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:26.860]
Who is Neil Rogers 179?

[00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:29.060]
24% of 745 votes

[00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:31.120]
Almost a quarter of the people out there

[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:33.180]
When they say they listen to the show the responses

[00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:34.000]
Who'd add?

[00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:36.140]
Who's uh...

[00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:37.440]
Is that hell of a cab?

[00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:40.860]
And a week from tomorrow is 31 years I've been on the ear in this town

[00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:45.260]
You can't complain about the promotion we get because we don't get any

[00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:49.080]
I don't tell anyone I listen to you 102 probably a good idea

[00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:52.700]
The responses? I'll write

[00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:54.220]
So do I 86

[00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:55.540]
So do I

[00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:59.080]
I can't stand that bastard 67

[00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:01.040]
You like Neil too? I love him

[00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:04.620]
He's the center of my universe I want to meet him, stalk him, do him be him 48

[00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:07.440]
See just reading that choice alone takes about half an hour

[00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:09.340]
I didn't write this

[00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:12.540]
He's still on I thought he retired or died 45

[00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:13.400]
Oh

[00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:18.780]
The ever presence of QIMN in the community

[00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:22.800]
I was at the sports station where they talk about ball games and jock straps all day

[00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:24.220]
Yeah, that's the one

[00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:26.340]
Ain't he the greatest?

[00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:27.260]
39

[00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:31.520]
Here's an interesting one where they say they listen to me the responses

[00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:32.300]
Why?

[00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:34.400]
33

[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:36.040]
Laughter 31

[00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:40.260]
Yeah like that not fall down on the floor laughter

[00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.520]
I hate this pull 29 3.8%

[00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:44.560]
That's cool 29

[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:46.720]
They don't get more any cooler than this

[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:48.160]
When's he on?

[00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:49.500]
What station? 28

[00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:52.440]
You often come you think out 26

[00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:57.040]
And then the FU get away from me 10 with all I'm swear you know

[00:09:58.640 --> 00:09:59.980]
Only 10 get away from me

[00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:01.520]
Unclean, unclean

[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:04.440]
But it is interesting I don't tell anyone I listen to you 102

[00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:05.940]
It's a closet thing

[00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:08.800]
Closet is getting really crowded again

[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:11.680]
Just when we thought we were clearing it out a little bit it's getting crowded again

[00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:16.580]
So now do you approve of this pull? I mean somebody send it in

[00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:18.480]
Approved of it?

[00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:21.860]
You... the question I think is

[00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:23.360]
Yeah no

[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:25.240]
You know what? No

[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:27.780]
I mean I like it in that it's a pull

[00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:28.920]
Laughter

[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:31.980]
It's one we don't have to come up with

[00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:37.480]
Chris is this a bad pull the one that we got up 30 though yeah that's Chris

[00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:38.620]
I have no problem with the pull

[00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:41.180]
And I voted for all right

[00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:44.300]
Oh that's what they tell you they tell you

[00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:44.920]
All right

[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:49.280]
What is it that you don't like about the pull Mr. Rodriguez?

[00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:53.240]
I'm not saying it's in this spectacular what?

[00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:56.400]
No it's just a... it's not controversial

[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.480]
It doesn't have like a lot of hate and venom that the people can get into

[00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:05.400]
Well the hell it doesn't it's got like a whole bunch of choices about what a piece of crap I am on there when they love that

[00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:06.660]
No not about you

[00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:07.780]
Yeah

[00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:09.320]
Kiss you on the top of your shaved head

[00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:12.300]
Yeah right no they don't

[00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:16.660]
I'm sending you a fact right now and one of them is about how this uh this judge this end-of-the-school judge

[00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:20.280]
He wants his own TV show I've been telling people that since the moment

[00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:22.200]
I saw him on TV oh yeah

[00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:26.260]
Sticking it up and he thinks he's funny

[00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.240]
And it's obvious that I told everybody

[00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:33.660]
He says you're a stranger than I'm gonna know that this guy just

[00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:36.860]
Hamming it up I said that he's going for a show

[00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:40.280]
He's auditioning that's what he was doing yesterday

[00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:40.500]
I know

[00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:44.020]
I've been up for about two minutes and he was just doing years ago

[00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:51.760]
Some of us have wives who like court TV and watch it all the time so I'm getting like double and triple dosage

[00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:53.060]
Of all that

[00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:55.600]
Yeah well they got some good stuff to cure that

[00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:57.960]
In fact you know what it is

[00:11:57.960 --> 00:11:59.380]
Yeah it works every time

[00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:03.660]
Provinces after 10 at 5.60 W.C.M. George doesn't like the day I pulled it

[00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:08.580]
He hates the one for tomorrow and then we're gonna do I think for Friday the name your favorite ancient restaurant

[00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:10.480]
That's you know been out of business for at least a hundred

[00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:13.320]
Come on now it's just to talk George which disease do you miss the most?

[00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:14.100]
Disease or condition?

[00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:15.660]
Measles? Rickets?

[00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:19.800]
Let's see anyone that kept me out of school I'll go to the O.M.

[00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:20.580]
The flagship station

[00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:24.980]
What the hell on access?

[00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:25.760]
I thought it was

[00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:27.880]
The death of Anna Nicole Smith

[00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:30.740]
You know what honestly this paternity issue is crazy

[00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:34.860]
We now have someone else stepping up saying I could be the father

[00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:37.220]
I've got a surprise for you

[00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:38.620]
Homer let me guess

[00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:40.200]
You dated Anna Nicole

[00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:41.240]
Superlating

[00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:44.000]
And you guys got freaky deaky?

[00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:46.780]
Something very close exactly along those lines

[00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:48.620]
And I knocked you up

[00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:50.060]
Really? Am right

[00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:51.600]
How was that possible?

[00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:53.120]
So I have to draw you a diagram?

[00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:55.640]
Homer you're a cartoon character

[00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:58.780]
Well well well if it isn't professor no at all

[00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:01.660]
And cartoon characters cannot not talk humans

[00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:03.320]
Oh crap I forgot

[00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:04.760]
I knew what had been here

[00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:08.900]
Ten seventeen

[00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:14.080]
Assess and the good news is we have 1216 friends at our Myspace page

[00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:15.980]
We have 1217 by deleted Tom

[00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:19.080]
How come I took me this long to do that until you guys told me to do that

[00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:21.240]
I don't know

[00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:22.140]
Because I'm dumb

[00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:24.760]
Because these guys have told me this morning

[00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:28.180]
That's the first thing you do when you shut up your page is you delete Tom

[00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:29.100]
Who's Tom?

[00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:30.520]
Tom is some

[00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:32.540]
I mean is there a real guy named Tom?

[00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:33.720]
Or is he just a figurehead?

[00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:36.440]
He was the one that invented it and he sold it a long time ago

[00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:36.960]
He was?

[00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:38.100]
A gazillion dollars

[00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:39.500]
In other words there's a real guy named Tom

[00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:41.660]
Right is it the guy that's stupid picture?

[00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:42.840]
Or remember that's him?

[00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:44.900]
But he probably lives on some island somewhere

[00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:45.540]
Yeah

[00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:48.300]
I'm so sick and tired of that thing popping up in the corner

[00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:51.220]
Or Tom's online, Tom's going away Tom

[00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:52.720]
So now I guess I'm not going to get there anymore

[00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:57.140]
And now when somebody applies to be your friend on there

[00:13:57.140 --> 00:14:00.560]
And you go to their profile and they have one friend and it's Tom

[00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:02.200]
You go like that

[00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:03.280]
Oh yeah

[00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:06.820]
790 on the pole, I don't say 790 that's bad

[00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:08.420]
It'll plant the acid in their mind

[00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:10.980]
Now to clarify us any programming tips for today or what?

[00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:12.420]
No, not yet

[00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:13.720]
But the day is young

[00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:18.340]
Because you know me on these Wednesdays my mind is way spit in ahead of time now

[00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:20.560]
I'm thinking about two o'clock

[00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:23.320]
I'm thinking actually about 145 when I finally put my shoes on

[00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:24.580]
I have all my clothes etc

[00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:29.760]
You're way to run out of that cab and zip off the woodbine and find me a good machine man

[00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:31.560]
Or maybe not a bad machine, I don't care

[00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:34.600]
I enjoy it either way it's just fun for the people mind

[00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:35.820]
It's fun for the old man you know

[00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:37.340]
I like it

[00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:40.720]
Wait till you're this way from North Logan, Utah

[00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:43.620]
Speaking of a Fargo, well what's Fargo Fargo is North Dakota

[00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:45.800]
Well same kind of thing, it's a state where nobody lives

[00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:48.740]
North Logan, Utah

[00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:51.200]
University is southern California hockey goal

[00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:54.160]
He put on a show but had nothing to do with stopping shots

[00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:55.820]
Mickey Meyer

[00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:57.160]
What a great name

[00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:59.320]
Mickey Meyer wrote his stick like a horse

[00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:01.220]
Dropped his bulky pants

[00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:04.620]
Moomed at the crowd and slapped his butt off during game against Brigham Young

[00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:05.380]
Police said

[00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:07.140]
Oh not against Brigham Young, those morons

[00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:08.160]
Woo!

[00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:11.600]
He was ejected and ticketed for ludeness

[00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:15.720]
A Mr. Meener, actor officer was working security at the ring city witness the scene Saturday

[00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:18.200]
He dropped his pantaloons

[00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:21.260]
I had my fill of those refs

[00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:25.060]
Meyer said on internet broadcast of the game court the hero journal of Logan, Utah

[00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:28.680]
It'll be up to prosecute his mother to pursue a case against him

[00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:32.940]
This is a small town north park police sergeant John Atele Sano said

[00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:38.100]
This was a college team playing and hockey's a wild game sometimes things get out of hand

[00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:39.940]
Right, whatever that means

[00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:45.520]
Meyer's annex occurred while play was stopped and the referees were trying to serve out penalties in the third period of a consolation game

[00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:48.880]
In the ACHA West Regional Terminat Eccles Ice Center

The junior from Clinton, New York was riding his hockey stick like a horse and slapping his butt

[00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:59.680]
North Park Officer Mike Stoffer said in the report I sure like his frozen dinners man

[00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:03.400]
I like the stuck peppers the Stoffer isn't it Stoffer makes that?

[00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:04.140]
I don't know

[00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:05.920]
I don't know who makes it

[00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:07.000]
Good stuff though

[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.800]
After pulling down his pants Meyer slapped his beer bottom several times

[00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:11.620]
Backed home his ass

[00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:12.140]
Backed home

[00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:18.880]
Rick manager Floyd Nagle was unhappy we don't treat this as a funny incident he said to his they were a family-oriented business

[00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:23.840]
It's a one-time incident we tried to do what we can to protect ourselves from perverts like that I guess he meant

[00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:28.980]
The Trojans lost the game against BYU 6-4 the night before they lost three to one to Utah state

[00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:30.200]
Boy they got some tourists

[00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:36.980]
USC volunteer hockey coach Mark Wilber said the incident highlights the frustration that can come with plain tournament consolation rounds

[00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:39.200]
Early in the morning after a loss far from home

[00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:44.720]
Oh yeah early in the morning don't you always want to drop your pants and ride your hockey stick like a horse and slap your ass a little bit

[00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:46.120]
Sure why not? Maybe that might hockey stick

[00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:46.780]
Early in the morning

[00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:51.060]
All you're doing is asking for seniors to do stupid stuff he said

[00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:56.360]
That sounds like the kind of coming at her in this station like the rationalization of any kind of stupid job behavior

[00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:57.780]
What's cause of it early in the morning?

[00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:02.320]
If the season's over he'd just like to pack up the team during her home he said

[00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:05.880]
Wilber said he had no specific policy for dealing with publicly bearded bottoms

[00:17:06.620 --> 00:17:09.940]
Welcome! I sure is how no condoned on any level he said

[00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:13.640]
Prosecutors Scott Wyatt laughed when told about the incident Tuesday at the state Capitol

[00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:16.820]
Where he's a member of the Utah House he declined to say whether he'd press charges

[00:17:16.820 --> 00:17:19.860]
They max him on penalty by the way 6 months in the slammer

[00:17:19.860 --> 00:17:22.280]
He'd have a lot of time to be moon and the inmates in there

[00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:25.280]
To have his pantaloonies down and I'm shredded over big

[00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:29.840]
Yeah well that's my call but I haven't seen anything for police why so that's the story from

[00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:32.520]
North Logan Utah about the bare bottom hockey goal

[00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:37.860]
Drop it his pantaloonies 7. I'd be able to have 802 shakes of a lamestailed before you can say

[00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:41.000]
Oh be by gosh by golly

[00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:44.840]
I'll see any phone calls from him and I was going to take a zinny to them today

[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.920]
I was going to take about 4,000 calls between now and two o'clock

[00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:51.120]
Because I figured being Wednesday the middle of the week

[00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:56.000]
And also maybe we can get some people to call and explain what ass Wednesdays all about

[00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:58.700]
That big thing? Sure let's do that

[00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:01.480]
Well there's Hannah the cool smith's mother on his stand that's the one and the cool

[00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:06.160]
States he was an evil bitch remember that yeah some of us can relate an evil hateful bitch

[00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:09.300]
Yeah some of us could relate to that whole mom's an evil bitch thing

[00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:12.200]
And I know you love people who tell you what kind of a relate to me when your mom is alive

[00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:18.780]
Because I know you got it all the time we'd take calls on the show where people would tell you what kind of a relationship you should have with your parents

[00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:22.100]
Oh yes but you love that as if they know

[00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:26.900]
Why aren't you nice to your mother why don't you help out your father remember you used to get the whole time

[00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:31.000]
Oh yes of course he's been dead for a few years now but nevertheless all the experts

[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:37.000]
Oh well of course that's the anti factor you know all these people listen to the shows they're the experts on your life and my life and my life

[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.140]
That's right everything just ask them no say or don't WDQYM hello

[00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:45.400]
Okay there's our first call today it's a successful dial tone let's hear it

[00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:49.260]
Alright at least that's working that is working WDQYM hello

[00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:52.320]
Hey how's it going today? Okay sir

[00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:59.460]
Good Neil did you see that new video the movie of the JFK and Jack one?

[00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:01.320]
What about what what is that proof?

[00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:09.760]
It doesn't prove anything but if you look behind on the other side of the street there's a guy in a suit in sunglasses

[00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:20.200]
And just as the mother Kate passes instead of watching Jackie and JFK he looks up to his left towards a down school book deposit towards Older

[00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:26.540]
Yeah absolutely wow and what does that tell us?

[00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:28.740]
Doesn't tell us anything but it's interesting

[00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:36.000]
Well you're easily interested okay thanks very much so there's a guy that's very easily interested I saw that footage

[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.640]
They showed it about 40 million times because they've got it that's why they do it because they got it and they can show it

[00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:48.520]
And it didn't show me a damn thing it didn't add a damn thing to it except of course like I said yesterday for the narration by the network shills

[00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:56.560]
Well it's been well proven that Le Harbours was the lone assassin oh no it has about that sure yeah sure like Frankie Pantangely would say

[00:19:57.220 --> 00:20:03.140]
Look at this phone man is it going to be one of those days that would not be good on ass Wednesday that's because they're all in church on their knees I would bet

[00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:04.700]
And maybe some of them might even be praying

[00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:11.320]
You better not start being disrespectful man William Donahue from the Catholic League is going to start kicking your ass

[00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:14.780]
You better watch it mister who will be peeing all over your leg if you don't watch it

[00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:18.520]
They william Donahue with the Clint's teeth the one that's out there the real far-bison guy you know

[00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:26.780]
So we scream at about anti-Catholic discrimination and but a beep but a boop but a bop and he never met a mafia hitman they didn't like all that stuff

[00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:29.000]
WDQAM hello

Happy ass Wednesday hello

[00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:33.640]

Like that oh man I kissed the ground I'm kissing the tape right here I'm kissing everything I can kiss an ass even my own

[00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:07.640]
That I'm not there what a place the sun is shining here and it's kind of toasty going to be 38 plus three Celsius today

[00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:10.840]
Not too bad nice day for woodbine and guess what I just noticed

[00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:16.980]
What in looking out my nice window with the sunny there's not a cloud in the sky it's a beautiful day

[00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:23.500]
For the 21st of February and the snow you know that we had that one day where we hit like three four inches snow it's all gone every every

[00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:27.640]
Flake basically is all gone 21st of February so like that guy to call yesterday

[00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:34.840]
Yeah what's your take on global warming what's your take on life and death what's your take on

[00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:43.880]
And uh crap you know I'm so glad that I'm out there you have no idea 814 both of you is outstanding pulled all this in the jewelry

[00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:45.940]
Call us oh

[00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:54.500]
Maybe you spend a lot of time around other men in the locker room in the shower maybe you play to the NBA you're retired

[00:21:54.500 --> 00:22:00.980]
And you have the need to express yourself nothing says it better than a card new from small mark

[00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:07.200]
The Tim Hardaway collection each card with a built-in chip opens to play a heartfelt bestest

[00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:12.980]
I heard gay people the Tim Hardaway collection features the most offensive thoughts in a lovely package

[00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:17.960]
Close-minded ignorant sentiments that question was really going on with the sender

[00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:21.340]
Um um you know I let it be known I don't like gay people

[00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:27.860]
Say it with a card when you claim homophobia and protest too much it's a cry for help and

[00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:37.220]
Agreeing the next time you have an opinion that's inappropriate but you just have to say it dig a hole for yourself by sending a card from the Tim Hardaway collection

[00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:42.480]
I have gay people from small mark where you care enough to make a jackass of yourself

[00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:52.080]
Alright 1031 at 560 WQAM Bob and Carl spring says you have no idea how lucky you are being in Canada and not subjected to the end in a cool second 24 hours a day

[00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:57.980]
How to duke it out over who will take possession of the body and where and in a cold Smith will be buried

[00:22:57.980 --> 00:22:59.140]
We're going to continue to follow

[00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:04.140]
Well I'm sure we are we're following it like uh uh the dog follows the send of a butchered cat

[00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:10.520]
Interesting the jackass judge sideline has become the 2007 version of judge Edo says Bob and Carl springs well guess what

[00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:12.140]
Somebody also facts this in

[00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:16.280]
Which I don't really care about that first part about the AM radio station with a super bowl tickets

[00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:18.720]
You find that it even marginally interesting?

[00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:19.580]
No

[00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:22.060]
I don't but the other part on here

[00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:28.040]
TMZ has learned judge Larry sideline's dream is to become a judge on a TV courtroom show

[00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:30.620]
How come you responded where George disappeared to?

[00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:33.660]
Let's just say it wasn't gas that he had

[00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:40.520]
So in other words he's making a return trip as we speak he was a little while ago

[00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:43.140]
He was right before the show he was racing down the hall

[00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:45.060]
Uh oh that's not good

[00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:46.400]
Oh man

[00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:53.060]
The endlessly entertaining Florida judges hearing the end of the cold cases had a TV show on the brain for months

[00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:54.700]
It says

[00:23:54.700 --> 00:24:00.080]
Sources say Judge sideline has even made a demo tape of cases that were recorded in his courtroom

[00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:02.380]
That's scary

[00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:04.100]
Talk about a hand bone

[00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:08.280]
Judge sideline whose name is extremely similar to judge Judy Shindland

[00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:11.600]
His name is Larry sideline, sideline and Shindland

[00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:15.340]
Graduated from night law school in New York

[00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:18.000]
sideline was a taxi driver who worked his way through his school

[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.480]
At the age of 28 he was the youngest judge ever to be elected in Broward County

[00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:24.480]
The 56 year old hand bone judges married with a young daughter

[00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:26.900]
George get back yet or not

[00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:30.060]
Wow heavy duty man

[00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:30.800]
That's bad news

[00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:33.100]
Well he didn't go right at the beginning of the break I guess it did

[00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:35.580]
Who's this on the bat line? QAM bat line hello

[00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:38.440]
Hello

[00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:42.340]
Hey can I be on hold so I can hear the show

[00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:43.700]
Who's this? George

[00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:47.460]
I don't want to miss anything

[00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:52.940]
Why you're not coming back for about an hour so what's going on with you now?

[00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:56.580]
Well you know that sound that you make when you get to the bottom of the milkshake

[00:24:57.180 --> 00:24:57.500]
Yeah

[00:24:57.500 --> 00:25:00.200]
Well that's what I'm that's the kind of sound I'm talking about

[00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:02.580]
I don't want to hear about it okay we don't want to hear those sounds okay

[00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:04.120]
We don't want to hear those slurping sounds

[00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:06.480]
Those little slurping would be good take one up play you can check

[00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:07.060]
Oh yeah

[00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:12.420]
So there's George that's the first on the near Roger show George calling from the can

[00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:14.440]
All right that was excellent

[00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:16.620]
Is that beautiful or what?

[00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:17.400]
That's awesome

[00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:24.160]
That was a radio first okay who says we don't do something new and different every day on this freaking dumbass old show?

[00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:24.780]
We're legendary

[00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:28.780]
I am legendary forget about you okay

[00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:30.220]
But hey you're legendary I'm a peon

[00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:31.800]
Yeah you're a peon all right

[00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:36.680]
And it's too bad because I just did the judge Judy's a story there with Judge Asylum

[00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:40.660]
Well we'll repeat that when George if George ever pulls his pants up and comes back out of there

[00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:45.860]
Remind me to do that again because he's all he's all whipped up about this Georgie hates him like poison

[00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:47.220]
And then rightfully so

[00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:51.360]
Hand me that up though the whole thing is a forest those two minutes ago yesterday

[00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:54.540]
It's just like a circus he's just conducting a circus in there

[00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:55.880]
George now we're talking about it

[00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:56.820]
Judge Judy

[00:25:57.740 --> 00:26:00.700]
It's funny because she's she's not trying to be funny

[00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:06.280]
She just says no she's like she's just saying you around right that it's just funny that it's coming from her mouth

[00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:10.060]
This guy is trying to be funny it's just contrived it's not funny

[00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:13.120]
Oh there's nothing worse than that ask our morning guys

[00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:17.640]
Okay how are we doing here um we got 832 votes on the pool

[00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:20.820]
What is the reaction you get when you tell others you listen to Neil

[00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:25.820]
Who's the O'Ryder's 204 that's bad man this is not a good sign

[00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:29.560]
Considering a week from Mars by 31st anniversary on here

And this is a God for second market 31 years and there are still people out there to who that who that

[00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:37.100]

No it is not everybody loves you

[00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:46.400]
You know seriously between Georgia's problem and the can and your suction this week man

[00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:48.440]
I don't know whether I'm going to survive all this I think

[00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:50.980]
No those folks are like the guy that said he uses body

[00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:51.960]

He's one having an episode like you had last week

[00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:12.840]
When how was that remember your elevators oh I see oh no you joking me he didn't like a

[00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:16.540]
Well I've never seen George run that fast before like I said

[00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:25.620]
We had like the we're the last break and he'll take my phone and the runs I see that's bad

[00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:34.520]
WDQ I am hello why you're actually taking calls from people other than George yeah what's

[00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:40.540]
With the negative area tone today about what yeah I think the first guy you first

[00:28:40.540 --> 00:28:47.740]
The guy out of the box you're asking about that tape and you give him a real hard talk about the Kennedy tape yeah I mean

[00:28:48.300 --> 00:29:00.620]
I mean you've got a nine train right now I did you see the did you see the tape yeah did you find anything interesting on there I think that you got to give it a little time

[00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:07.680]
I don't have a train it's boring man the tape was boring and you're boring okay give it a little time

[00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:13.780]
I'm always here in his out to give people a lot more time I'm going to tell you something

[00:29:13.780 --> 00:29:18.900]
So there's nothing worse than being intentionally boring some people are accidentally boring like Joseph Gackie

[00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:23.300]
They just sound that way and they can't help it they're trying their best but they're just not they were born boring

[00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:28.560]
But putting jackasses like you on here to give me a lecture about how I should know the negative

[00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:35.620]
Tone like that there was nothing interesting about that tape okay it was Jackie and J.F.K. in limo

[00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:42.360]
Before the shooting and it was nothing nothing worth seeing they've shown it 50 trillion times I'd rather watch Dick Cheney fall down and break his neck

[00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:49.060]
Which hopefully you'll do here in the right place for war from former ambassador Joe Wilson prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald

[00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:53.200]
Yeah, we know all about it and nobody cares about that they want to know about this this freaking judge

[00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:55.720]
WDQA and hello

[00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:00.380]
Hello

[00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:08.380]
Okay, get a new phone get when it works did George make it back on right here? Oh there you go

[00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:15.460]
So I didn't fall in anyway that's good no you know radio history that was radio history in the making so

[00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:19.580]
Yeah, George was making and we were making radio history on the legendary Roger Scherz

[00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:24.220]
I heard some real boring call when I came in here that we have exactly how come you're so never the negative

[00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:29.280]
Territory tone about the J.F.K. you know you saw that tape

[00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:38.300]
Are 100 times 80 billion times and there's nothing else that's going on and this is because there's nothing else going on

[00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:43.220]
So you didn't hear the thing about Judge Scydlin who's made a demo take the cases that recorded in his courtroom

[00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:47.940]
And his name is extreme the similar judge Judy Shindlin and his name is Scydlin he ain't no judge Judy

[00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:54.200]
At 2080 was the youngest judge ever to be elected and Broward and he's got a TV show on the brain for the show

[00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:59.080]
For months it says here it says his dream is to become a judge on a TV courtroom show

[00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:05.040]
Of course I'm so on as if as if we haven't a caught on with it. He's sticking it up he's yulking it up

[00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:10.640]
He can stick it up right then there is deep as he can reach baby he can stick it all the way to the moon but he's not

[00:31:11.060 --> 00:31:16.180]
Yeah and and this is supposed to be some heavy duty stuff you know about the kid and we're so concerned about poor Danny Lynn

[00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:21.100]
And this one and that one the putrid rotting body and all this crap I don't care about it at all

[00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:27.180]
In fact let me just turn over to the CBC since that one facts every you know you're lucky to be there not to be dead

[00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:32.860]
Huge with all this crap let's see if the CBC is pending naturally on progress and the capability of the rocky city

[00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:39.560]
There's the CBC they got Tony Blair now they're talking about cutting the British force they're talking about something that has a little significance in the world

[00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:45.200]
People are dying all over the place violence and murder and bloodshed and they got real news on there

[00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:48.280]
Not freaking Annan Nicole Smith and her putrid sticky body

[00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:49.600]
I don't know too God

[00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:51.680]
I'm sorry

[00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:55.620]
I was responsible for that team effort

[00:31:56.280 --> 00:32:05.220]
I grew up in the Catholic way served as an alter boy every Sunday after mass the priest would ask if I could say lame

[00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:08.700]
But asking to go on a little job

[00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:18.120]
Work me that an angry God wouldn't be pleased if I didn't get down on my knees and that nobody should ever know

[00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:21.160]
That team showed me his holy roll

[00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:27.420]
All three boys when they wear a dress comes in handy for easy access

[00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:33.460]
They reach up under there and give it a grab and like it best with their nuts and sacks

[00:32:33.460 --> 00:32:40.360]
The parents got mad at him when he got caught at least until the Vatican paid him all off

[00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:47.040]
They shipped them out to Arizona to a train to get forgiven by the Pope and gives his little brown room

[00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:48.180]
You can't do it

[00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:51.380]
You can't do it

[00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:53.320]
1046, 14 to 11 a queue

[00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:56.560]
Let's see let's look at Wednesday schedule it's a pretty pristine and clean

[00:32:56.560 --> 00:33:04.100]
This is the old queen mad dog a two four to five to power our with hankin' a mad dog together hang a Henry Goldberg five to seven then oh boy

[00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:06.120]
How much of parents ain't there today is he?

[00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:08.100]
No, he probably is there because it's a home game

[00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:11.300]
Is he there? I think I saw him today

[00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:16.620]
Now who cares? Seven o'clock at two he canes warm up seven thirty its canes basketball against Virginia

[00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:22.640]
And then the core canes wrap up when the game is finally over at long last and then game night would just see anger following that game

[00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:27.640]
Oh not game that on the hurricane's and I kind of talk about that all the way to midnight are they on this station? Oh my god

[00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:32.620]
Couple more for the poll one and look what this is from university Dodge

[00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:39.500]
You know I'm sure hope there's some cars over there because they sure as hell spend most of the rest of the day facts and that's a bunch of crap

[00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:41.660]
For the pool why do you listen to a fag?

[00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:44.840]
That's good and also why do you listen to an atheist?

[00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:49.140]
We'll put them right on there get those right on there

[00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:54.940]
Here's another poll from somebody what judge has left the most memorable impression in your mind this is good I like that

[00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:58.920]
Got a bunch of walkin' around here and judge Judy and a lot of strangers

[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.940]
That's good thank you very much lot polls are coming in like crazy lately and you know what I don't care if they're good enough

[00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:08.560]
Now here's an interesting article from Andy and Miami Beach which I already saw this

[00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:15.460]
You see how I dropped I was number always on number 15 or something like that in the talker magazine poll and I'm done number 69

[00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:20.940]
They fear that it's gonna take a little more suggestive in there. Yeah it says you were talking the other day about

[00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:25.600]
Sogarass Mills and you seem to ask a lot about it so here's the scoop. Yeah scoop this Andy

[00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:32.280]
They didn't additional last year that makes it about 2.6 million square feet which makes it the fourth largest mall in the country

[00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:34.580]
How do you like that? Oh my god

[00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:38.920]
Adventurer mall's new edition puts it about 2.5 million square feet to fifth largest

[00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:45.940]
By comparison since I know you spend much of your time there in which I do not the Eaton Center is 1.6 million square feet

[00:34:45.940 --> 00:34:50.980]
Well, a lot of you know I guess Toronto's gonna have to apologize and get our hands in these and say oh

[00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:56.060]
We're so sorry that the Eaton Center is only 1.6 million square feet but the Sogarass is so much bigger

[00:34:56.060 --> 00:35:00.660]
The only difference being that I can see is that the Eaton Center has a lot of great stories and there's good reasons to go there

[00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:02.560]
That's what I see

[00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:08.700]
And then it goes on to say the shoppers at Sogarass superior to me is the typical suburban-broward resident shoppers

[00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:12.360]
Now have you ever heard anything so ridiculous in your life? No?

[00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:16.560]
I mean I never meant anybody who speaks English at the Sogarass

[00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:24.400]
Adventurer mall is usually a flesh fest packed with women showing off their goods, their big boobies, val harbour shops

[00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:26.660]
Which has the highest sales per square foot in the country

[00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:29.120]
Oh Andy must be a mall expert

[00:35:30.100 --> 00:35:34.700]
I guess the Bentley trophy wife cried and I saw Tom Brady there a few weeks ago shopping alone

[00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:36.440]
Poor Tommy he needs company

[00:35:37.180 --> 00:35:39.840]
Of course the hottest women I would link and wrote with their dogs

[00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:43.140]
Sogarass does seem to bust in tourists at certain times of the year

[00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:48.020]
It's not unusual that Sogarass is one of Florida's largest tourist attractions that happens a lot with malls

[00:35:48.020 --> 00:35:53.440]
For example it says the Eaton Center is listed in guidebooks as the number one tourist attraction in Toronto

[00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:55.660]
Oh my God

[00:35:55.660 --> 00:35:58.380]
I mean how about the CN Tower? How about the Skydome?

[00:35:58.740 --> 00:36:02.300]
The Eaton Center is the number one tourist attraction in Toronto? How about the Eels apartment?

[00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:09.840]
Also it says I saw the latest talkers magazine has the meaning was 2007 heavy-hundred list putting you with the apropos 69 position

[00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:12.320]
Randy was lucky number 13

[00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:16.220]
Oh yeah, she's a good long way with my material I'll tell you that

[00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:17.800]
But nevertheless who cares?

[00:36:19.580 --> 00:36:22.780]
873 votes on the poll today let's get the phone smoking here man

[00:36:22.780 --> 00:36:24.440]
George was in there he was smoking it

[00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:26.880]
Let's get this I don't think it's going to happen today in the phone

[00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:27.940]
I don't know

[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:32.060]
You don't know what? I don't know if it is I mean you don't think so

[00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:32.280]
I don't think so

[00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:36.540]
I'm going to promise you and of course I'm so a negativity about the Kennedy tape you know

[00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:38.440]
5670560

[00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:41.540]
Pound 560 in the Verizon singular wireless line

[00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:46.300]
Ask Wednesday baby I think this could be very educational I think a lot of us heathens would like to find out

[00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:50.160]
What it's all about and what the significance is of Schmurrin and Mash is on your forehead

[00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:52.420]
What's that supposed to prove what does it do for you?

[00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:58.440]
How about a Herschmur the ashes on my machine it would bind today I love those people they help I love the especially women

[00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:05.760]
But sometimes guys you know sometimes like guys from India and place like that very superstitious and they take and they rub their hands over the glass on the machine

[00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:09.540]
You know they rub their hands across the glass and then they lose their ass you know

[00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:13.400]
I don't know what is that supposed to do is that for good luck is an ass on the machine

[00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:17.340]
You know they rub their hands across the glass and then they lose their ass you know

[00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:23.860]
I don't know what is that supposed to do is that for good luck is that the night I guess there's all the superstitious rituals that people do

[00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:27.520]
When they gamble lucky other people do anything like me QIM hello

[00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:36.220]
Everybody Wang Chung tonight everybody Wang Chung tonight

[00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:38.320]
WQ I am hello

[00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:39.140]
Oh I'm here

[00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:40.160]
Yes sir

[00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:41.940]
That guy must have been a molex for everybody

[00:37:41.940 --> 00:37:43.440]
It sounds like it

[00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:47.780]
But let me ask your question is it the path part of the eating center or the eating center separate?

[00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:52.060]
Well I mean the path is an underground yeah it goes through the eating center yeah

[00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:57.200]
That's pretty damn big so I think that's probably bigger than the sawgrass

[00:37:57.200 --> 00:37:59.920]
But sawgrass is okay all right you know take care now

[00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:00.440]
Okay

[00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:03.660]
Oh

[00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:06.900]
Woo

[00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:09.620]
Man and you don't want to be here

[00:38:10.380 --> 00:38:14.800]
I can't imagine anybody I don't want to be with the cream of the craft the intelligentsia

[00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:21.380]
These people are the best the path the path is just an underground walkway

[00:38:21.380 --> 00:38:23.720]
They have it in Montreal too I don't know what they call it there hey

[00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:28.980]
But they have the same thing underground and of course in cities up north where there's a lot of brutal weather

[00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:32.660]
There's not so much lately because we have global warming we're all going to die but aside from that

[00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:39.460]
It's another ground path that goes through the eating center through a lot of for blocks and blocks and does that

[00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:43.240]
And I don't really pay much attention to it okay I'm not kind of an underground kind of guy

[00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:44.920]
I like being above ground I don't know about you

[00:38:45.740 --> 00:38:49.860]
I guess that all depends on who's on the ground and who's above it and what they're doing

[00:38:49.860 --> 00:38:51.740]
WQ I am hello

[00:38:56.120 --> 00:39:00.240]
Yeah, what did they mention the river bridge that came out this year called something in the air

[00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:05.120]
All these in this market Fisher and we're going to come to the book first thought you called it

[00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:06.540]
You can through the south there the radio

[00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:09.180]
He's an idiot he's an idiot Mark Fisher

[00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:11.740]
He's the one that wrote that hatchet job in a herald on me a hundred years ago

[00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:15.260]
He's a jackass Mark Fisher

[00:39:15.260 --> 00:39:19.800]
Let me say to you again sir in traffic magazine in the herald he ripped me an ass he did a hatchet job

[00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:23.440]
He should only croak a wicked death I don't want to be a negativity like that one guy said

[00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:25.500]
What is with these people?

[00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:29.940]
Well somebody mentioned you in talker's magazine and somebody mentioned you in Mark Fisher

[00:39:29.940 --> 00:39:32.620]
Mark Fisher and Macy Fisher okay same guy

[00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:37.440]
God are you people terminal why did you talk me to taking these stupid calls today?

[00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:40.660]
Because I'm a bastard because you really are because you don't like to pull today

[00:39:40.660 --> 00:39:42.940]
So you're all bent out of shape that's why God is punish you

[00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:46.460]
You're a better nurse. She squirts or whatever you got by the way speaking of that

[00:39:46.460 --> 00:39:50.680]
Yes, I remember once in a while you walk into the bathroom and you realize that somebody missed and they're sliding

[00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:54.740]
Oh I don't wait listen listen listen to me right now nip it in the butt okay

[00:39:54.740 --> 00:39:57.620]
I know you I know you're speaking from recent personal experience

[00:39:57.620 --> 00:40:03.360]
We're not going to get an expiratory on the show today okay we have enough baggage we have enough baggage in the morning okay

[00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:08.540]
What desperately trying to find where that line is and usually being way way over it

[00:40:08.540 --> 00:40:11.340]
We have enough of the OTT will with that we're not going to contribute our part

Those are the only radio connected things that I have any interest in plot so ever okay the 10th and the 25th payday speaking of candy bars

[00:42:49.260 --> 00:42:55.920]

[00:42:56.940 --> 00:43:10.300]

The old juxtap just take what it used to be hide your heart away

[00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:12.300]
900 votes on a poll but we got a thousand easy today even though we're very negative to any audience is just more disgusting than ever than usual

[00:44:13.340 --> 00:44:17.460]
Here's a poll a poll a fact from Tracy who says about ass Wednesday

[00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:25.820]
She says ass Wednesday is the first day of lense which lasts for four days ending in Easter it's the day after show of Tuesday

[00:44:25.820 --> 00:44:35.760]
Marty Gra the last day of carnival season carnival from the Latin Carné Valle which means farewell meat I think I've said that

[00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:44.260]
Mark's the time when Catholics give up something traditionally meat for the Lenten season until Easter to show penance and reflect on the sacrifices of Jesus and blah blah blah

[00:44:44.820 --> 00:45:01.120]
That's a good thing I had my meatloaf yesterday that's right first they don't got no meatloaf or wood mine anyway but you know I can eat there free anytime I want you to understand that I didn't know my point for my card right and the food that they serve there I wouldn't I wouldn't serve it to a kitty cat that's how bad it is

[00:45:02.540 --> 00:45:12.620]
There are loopholes in a Lent where you can have meat on Fridays or something in Catholics of Irish heritage are exempt from fasting on St. Paddy's day which is mighty convenient no so Tracy yes

[00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:30.800]
Here in the Orleans many people give up different things and not everyone who does it is Catholic it's a pretty heavy tradition here and is our local excuse for the excessive decadence of carnival season says Tracy thank you Tracy that's for you oh I should have given that up sorry for Lenten can that be Lenten I said that before can that be Lenten how about can that be felt

[00:45:31.540 --> 00:45:40.700]
Mine hundred down the pool baby even though George hates this pool like poison no that other one about the close restaurants I hated like poison this one I'm going to go into anything

[00:46:04.820 --> 00:46:15.680]
was that Harry Casey I think it was a judge yesterday order that OJ Simpson's income from past work on movies TV and commercials go directly to the family murder victim

[00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:20.680]
Ron Goldman but he rejected the family's bid to collect Simpson's earnings on future project all men

[00:46:22.180 --> 00:46:30.300]
Simpson as we all know well too well was acquitted in October 95 a murder charges in the June 1994 slangs of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and Goldman

[00:46:30.300 --> 00:46:37.740]
but a civil court jury later held a libel for the killings in a wrongful death lawsuit ordered him to pay 33 and a half million dollars most of that that remains on paid

[00:46:37.740 --> 00:46:44.620]
Simpson now as you know it says here in Miami in the Sun settle I would call it candle myself is that where he lives hello

[00:46:44.620 --> 00:46:55.540]
candle is candle is an unaccompanied date it's a Miami he lives there lawyers for both sides portrayed Tuesday's ruling on royalties or other earnings by LA County Superior Court judge

[00:46:55.540 --> 00:47:05.040]
Joe Rosenberg as a victory Simpson attorney yelled go Lanter said royalties Simpson received some past work for films such as the naked gun moving the TV show first in 10

[00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:17.400]
amount to almost nothing last year Simpson's royalty checks from all of his movies will less than 39 cents Glender said they all thanks too much if he got 39 even if he got 30 cents still too much

[00:47:18.260 --> 00:47:31.060]
they got kicked to the curb again he had it every door they're banging on get slammed however golden attorney David J. Cokes said the ruling on past royalties was a step in the right direction indicating the family would seek to determine what Simpson's royalties really amount to

[00:47:31.540 --> 00:47:59.180]
we presume there is money we're not going to take the word for a cook said Rosenberg deferred ruling on a third request by the goblins to collect any advance money Simpson may have received for the book and TV show if I did it if I done it he scheduled a hearing on the matter March 13th the if I done a project in which Simpson was to explain how he might have committed the killings was abandoned amid public outrage Simpson who maintains his innocence of course has said he took part in the project the secures children's financial future and then his advance for the projects already been spent

[00:48:00.540 --> 00:48:00.940]

it means you're really Catholic I mean oh I see horror what about if you have the whole

[00:58:49.620 --> 00:58:52.840]

[00:59:05.480 --> 00:59:12.220]
of the human race and this is the truth the only hope for the future is a ban on all religions

[00:59:14.040 --> 00:59:19.260]
yeah good luck that's correct well I mean it's bad for business obviously but never

[00:59:19.260 --> 00:59:24.860]

and of course the Jews with the tits and the the fillin and all this other crap the doveting

[00:59:44.260 --> 00:59:49.020]
are you picking on the Jews again oh is that it was you know the not only the Jews in the

[00:59:49.020 --> 00:59:52.640]
Arabs that they're all circumcised they have that in common but the doveting you know the

[00:59:52.640 --> 00:59:56.240]

[01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:16.380]
obama's enthusiasm as uh you know it's well pensy for a known-nonsense approach and all that

tremendous input we've had here day nine sixty four on that pool holy crap man animal control

[01:08:15.160 --> 01:08:20.540]
authorities are not amused by a fast food chains marketing stunt encouraging customers to

warning not all cats will be down with this uh wearing this bag do not harm or endanger any cat

[01:09:08.020 --> 01:09:11.720]
is not enough the agency said the warning's not enough what if you have a hep cat

[01:09:13.500 --> 01:09:17.400]
we have no ill will toward checkers or rap cat as a character said animal services spokeswoman

[01:09:17.400 --> 01:09:22.160]
Marty Ryan our message is that it's not a good idea to try to stuff a cat in a bag it's just a

[01:26:50.900 --> 01:26:55.600]
brant badosky served as legislative assistant to us senator Lloyd Benson remember Lloyd Benson

[01:26:55.600 --> 01:27:00.080]

[01:27:06.720 --> 01:27:10.480]
well i just i just like to give a little background so they have some idea who brant badosky is

[01:27:10.480 --> 01:27:18.140]
he says cheney liby neocons bollies without balls he writes the child is the father of the man

[01:27:18.140 --> 01:27:21.720]
the brilliant maneuvers and influence pedaling of certain elites to avoid military service

[01:27:22.200 --> 01:27:26.060]
neviatinomore left two ugly legacies that do great damage to american troops today

[01:27:26.860 --> 01:27:30.860]
first they learned young that wars are meant to be fought by certain classes which they are above

[01:27:30.860 --> 01:27:35.560]
they grew up with the entitlement spirit of the elite the privileged classes send the obvious to

[01:27:35.560 --> 01:27:41.280]
fight the wars George Herbert Walker Bush a star athlete in college George W. Bush was the cheerleader

[01:27:42.060 --> 01:27:46.240]
and politics that translates into adulthood into a refusal to admit that they were wrong and

[01:27:46.240 --> 01:27:50.600]
a refusal to take responsibility for their mistakes the war hero protects the band of brothers

[01:27:50.600 --> 01:27:56.760]
the wind blames us abordinates look at cheney instead of taking responsibility like a man he

[01:27:56.760 --> 01:28:01.080]
works desperately and feversly to put pin the blame on others the war hero takes responsibility of

[01:28:01.080 --> 01:28:06.360]
command the wind blames those under his command look at liby allowing his aide kathy martin to be

[01:28:06.360 --> 01:28:10.600]
blamed at a white house meeting for what scooter did what kind of vanguarius wimp allows his staff

[01:28:10.600 --> 01:28:15.820]
to take the blame for his own mistakes this is a recruiting pattern in the sort of deferred liby

[01:28:15.820 --> 01:28:20.220]
case on the raki war second not only do those who never serve failed to understand military

[01:28:20.220 --> 01:28:24.660]
doctrine or have military judgment they believe generals and edmels are part of the lower class who

[01:28:24.660 --> 01:28:29.760]
fight the wars not the upper classes who send them to fight they believe the troops exist to be

[01:28:29.760 --> 01:28:35.160]
used for political gain but allow them to be without body armor other needs until this day the

[01:28:35.160 --> 01:28:39.280]
athlete enters the arena and fights with the gladiators the cheerleaders talk tough from the safety of

[01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:44.400]
the sidelines send others to fight the wars blame others for the mistakes use others for political

[01:28:45.200 --> 01:28:51.760]
god save our troops from bullies without balls says brand you've all brant but out ski

[01:28:52.840 --> 01:28:57.400]

[01:30:02.060 --> 01:30:07.380]
attorney told the military jury yesterday in eggland air force base captain debris elter

[01:30:07.380 --> 01:30:11.960]

[01:30:21.360 --> 01:30:25.900]
to rape two other men he faces a maximum sentence of life in prison without parole if convicted of all

[01:30:25.900 --> 01:30:31.040]
the charges against him the charges are two counts of attempted sodomy four counts of forceable

[01:30:39.020 --> 01:30:40.300]
unlawful entry back home

[01:30:41.500 --> 01:30:45.840]
this case is about homosexual activity that is not approved by the military services in our

[01:30:45.840 --> 01:30:50.100]
country this time every one of these individuals but one is either in the military service

[01:30:50.100 --> 01:30:54.460]
or wants to be in that service regan said under the military's don't ask don't tell policy

[01:30:54.460 --> 01:30:57.760]
military members who are openly garrison to discharge so to speak

[01:30:57.760 --> 01:31:01.420]
for the men were the military when they met taylor in a fifth fear that disclosing his

[01:31:01.420 --> 01:31:05.100]
relationship with taylor would ruin his chances of pursuing an evie career said regan

[01:31:05.100 --> 01:31:09.060]
who said taylor would testify about his relationships with the men you're fairy

[01:31:10.220 --> 01:31:14.360]
captain evil on westbrook the military prosecutor evil on

[01:32:00.540 --> 01:32:05.700]
because he felt drugged it it he couldn't fight him off you have heard that excuse the man said he

[01:32:05.700 --> 01:32:09.080]
didn't report the encounter until two years later when he read a newspaper report about taylor's

[01:32:09.080 --> 01:32:14.660]

windows and some some old cockroach standing there hunched over the damn program in a racing

[01:35:19.320 --> 01:35:22.680]
form what do you think you're about three people behind him online and going to get shut out

especially to her face stern wants to very smith be silvers on the baha mous

[01:39:20.700 --> 01:39:25.140]
he's squaring off with smith's strange mother burji arthur who wants to take smith to

[01:39:25.140 --> 01:39:28.420]
were uh... native texas to the mark day four in their legal battle

recording of an interview shortly before her death and which he disparage the relationship

[01:40:06.860 --> 01:40:12.520]
with her mother following she'll never touch my child that bitch that psycho bitch she said

[01:40:12.520 --> 01:40:16.480]
something like that since you're nuts and the judge heard from arthur who sent she had a healthy

[01:40:16.480 --> 01:40:20.220]
relationship with her daughter until smith started using drugs about twelve years ago

[01:40:20.760 --> 01:40:25.120]

burglary this is what apparently started out as the so you know these stories of all

[01:40:43.680 --> 01:40:48.720]
so that may change no more whether it was an armed burglary so obviously that is why they're

[01:40:48.720 --> 01:40:52.940]

[01:40:52.940 --> 01:40:57.320]

[01:42:11.040 --> 01:42:17.100]
last night on keith o'roman countdown did you see it last night i saw a little bit

[01:42:17.100 --> 01:42:20.220]
show when they did a little montage on the judge no

[01:42:20.220 --> 01:42:23.600]
okay that was hilarious was like the last five minutes of the show where they put

[01:42:23.600 --> 01:42:27.080]
a montage of all his it was like a sick tom thing or something that was pretty

[01:42:27.080 --> 01:42:31.140]
hilarious yeah he's a football this guy oh i know i did yeah

[01:42:31.740 --> 01:42:33.720]
it's in perfectly with this this melodrama

[01:42:33.720 --> 01:42:38.260]
the other thing on sunday i know how much you love the gaico commercials and on

[01:42:38.260 --> 01:42:43.860]
sunday i saw a thing on cd sunday morning about the ad agency that developed

[01:42:44.500 --> 01:42:47.660]
there actually out of rich men virginia there's some medium

[01:42:48.700 --> 01:42:52.580]
there's some like small medium-sized ad agency not based in new york

[01:42:52.580 --> 01:42:56.920]
they're the ones that came up with the caveman like gaico gaico and then the

[01:42:56.920 --> 01:43:01.720]
celebrity thing that you love so much that was an interesting piece

[01:43:01.720 --> 01:43:06.240]
considering they're just like a small time kind of non-New York based ad agency

[01:43:06.240 --> 01:43:09.900]
well that was a nice view why it's so good yeah i wonder right yeah they're

[01:43:09.900 --> 01:43:13.160]
inside the the president of the ad agency was a fascinating guy

[01:43:13.820 --> 01:43:17.840]
and they also they've got the ups contract and then regrettably or whatever

[01:43:17.840 --> 01:43:21.280]
doesn't matter they just got walmart just signed with them too so i thought that was

[01:43:21.280 --> 01:43:24.640]
a fascinating story that their creativity and their their

[01:43:24.640 --> 01:43:28.080]

the ceiling is so bad i'm gonna be sick

[01:45:56.080 --> 01:45:59.220]
a ten sixty six hundred poll not to be able to make eleven hundred

[01:45:59.220 --> 01:46:03.160]
easy they will slide out of that will and i got my shirt and pantaloomies on

all right i'm here ready for an early departure today

[01:46:06.960 --> 01:46:10.600]
maybe you can do like one fifteen to two o'clock what you say that's all right

[01:46:11.260 --> 01:46:15.220]
if you have a better home or that's some spots we got some life spots in the

[01:46:15.220 --> 01:46:18.160]
next hour i think they did that intentionally to keep me around

[01:46:19.640 --> 01:46:22.340]
although maybe we could play the tape between like one thirty and two what do you

[01:46:22.340 --> 01:46:24.740]
say the tape of the last hour i was out of it it can get a bit

[01:46:24.740 --> 01:46:27.480]
many better than the last time i've been a little bit of a lot to be

[01:46:28.560 --> 01:46:33.000]
tell me stressed out commuters got a peaceful surprise as they boarded in his

[01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:37.540]
really bus yesterday a yoga instructor with a microphone coaching them how to

[01:46:37.540 --> 01:46:41.260]
breathe correctly and of course if they're on the wrong

[01:46:41.260 --> 01:46:43.360]
road they probably won't have a lot of practice doing it but

[01:46:43.360 --> 01:46:47.180]
nevertheless the passengers stretch their hands toward the ceiling

[01:46:47.800 --> 01:46:52.160]
and bent their heads forward as mary howrovy a twenty one year veteran

[01:46:52.160 --> 01:46:55.980]
yoga teacher guided them through a set exercise that can be formed while

[01:46:55.980 --> 01:47:00.360]
sitting down alano all kinds of exercises you can do while sitting down but

[01:47:00.360 --> 01:47:04.460]
nevertheless i think that because of our history of tear on buses erovy said

[01:47:04.460 --> 01:47:07.860]
refer to the past suicide attacks that have targeted crowded buses

[01:47:08.440 --> 01:47:12.020]
it's very important to do yoga to relax and show that everyone uh... everyone

[01:47:12.020 --> 01:47:16.060]
life is stronger than fear the only thing we have to fear are the goyam

[01:47:16.940 --> 01:47:20.600]
herovy said the idea of a uh... yoga bus came to her in the middle of the

[01:47:20.600 --> 01:47:24.020]
night while she was sleeping she talked to the telly bus company they

[01:47:24.020 --> 01:47:28.160]
jumped on the idea they jumped her most of the passengers on the bus

[01:47:28.160 --> 01:47:31.860]
participated many said they felt relaxed and more ready for work the yoga buses

[01:47:31.860 --> 01:47:35.220]
run every Tuesday for three weeks but herovy hopes that the program will

[01:47:35.220 --> 01:47:39.900]
continue to expand she and her husband gila harovy have worked for years to

[01:47:39.900 --> 01:47:43.780]
promote yoga in his reals television in public schools we want people to try yoga

[01:47:43.780 --> 01:47:45.920]
and feel how good it is how will be said

[01:47:46.980 --> 01:47:48.760]

[01:47:50.540 --> 01:47:53.980]
uh... yogurt all the yoga ain't bad

[01:47:53.980 --> 01:47:56.940]
what do you mean by that exercise you can do all your land down

now you have to have your magic carpet to that or what today is ass wins day by

[01:48:02.240 --> 01:48:06.460]

[01:48:13.640 --> 01:48:17.000]
you see we got too many heathens out there in the audience we don't have enough

[01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:21.080]
of people of god in this crowd that's the problem or do you heathen bastards

[01:48:21.860 --> 01:48:25.060]
that's why that's in last place on that poll why do you listen to an atheist

[01:48:25.060 --> 01:48:28.680]
only three people would say that if my name came up if my name popped up

[01:48:28.680 --> 01:48:33.940]
the conversation five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty and he

[01:48:33.940 --> 01:48:37.640]
verized in singular wireless line pretty slim and grim here on his phone

[01:48:37.640 --> 01:48:40.760]
and you think we'd really be smoking after the great calls we've had today

[01:48:40.760 --> 01:48:45.100]

[01:48:49.060 --> 01:48:53.260]
court case with the shandrick all sorts can be like another o t sent in michael

[01:48:53.260 --> 01:48:57.520]
jaxian trials get better yeah uh...

[01:48:57.520 --> 01:48:59.040]
uh... the listen but you know i

[01:49:03.060 --> 01:49:07.700]
it sounds like you're tapping out more scot yeah i'm tapping tapping a message to

[01:49:07.700 --> 01:49:08.660]
garcia okay

[01:49:09.280 --> 01:49:12.560]
anti garcia or maybe a micro see used to be for the indians

[01:49:12.560 --> 01:49:15.740]
nineteen fifty four indians one hundred eleven games in nineteen fifty four

[01:49:15.740 --> 01:49:19.220]
you know that for the indians and they got swept by the new york giants and

[01:49:19.220 --> 01:49:22.940]
dusty roads in the nineteen fifty four world serious can't be possible

[01:49:22.940 --> 01:49:23.820]
in the rest of

[01:49:24.680 --> 01:49:28.160]
not the same dusty roads okay if i could just the roads was a less-handed pinch

[01:49:28.160 --> 01:49:28.560]
hitter

[01:49:29.060 --> 01:49:33.940]
and in the poll grounds they had a real short right field uh... uh... uh... uh... thing

[01:49:35.380 --> 01:49:39.540]
porch and as a result he was he was hitting all these like pop fly home runs in

[01:49:39.540 --> 01:49:42.480]
a right field for the giants as they beat the indians i believe in four straight

[01:49:42.480 --> 01:49:45.240]
i think they swept that year after the ins of one hundred eleven games in the

[01:49:45.240 --> 01:49:45.820]
regular season

[01:49:46.700 --> 01:49:50.120]

legendary demons but one of our all-time favorites

[01:51:45.260 --> 01:51:46.140]

you never said to me all only people over the age of a hundred

[01:51:57.880 --> 01:52:01.640]
that is correct well why is that because it's timeless and it's good as opposed to

[01:52:01.640 --> 01:52:05.800]
that bubble gum gay boy music that you were into for a while now I'm not talking about the music

[01:52:05.800 --> 01:52:10.500]
I'm talking about these polls about all these stuff you know because music is timeless and they

[01:52:10.500 --> 01:52:14.680]
need to know about this the youngsters need to know about that good old the youngsters the music

[01:52:14.680 --> 01:52:18.660]

[01:55:46.260 --> 01:55:48.740]
I wish I'd never been born in South Florida

[01:55:50.660 --> 01:55:52.580]
Because some of us didn't have a choice to be here

[01:55:54.080 --> 01:55:57.200]

[01:56:07.700 --> 01:56:12.420]
Tremendous and you're making all this money. Oh, what's that cut to do with this? Is that make it a great place? Oh, absolutely not

[01:56:13.700 --> 01:56:19.300]

Now you've got to hide your heart away

[01:57:04.920 --> 01:57:10.740]
Yeah, you've got to hide your heart away

[01:57:12.700 --> 01:57:18.620]
Now we'll slot an ugly battle to that straight game

[01:57:18.620 --> 01:57:24.020]
We'll buy men to call up our men

[01:57:24.020 --> 01:57:29.480]

Yeah, you've got to hide your heart away

[01:58:03.960 --> 01:58:05.860]
Yeah, I think the motto is if you die, I'll cry

[01:58:05.860 --> 01:58:07.720]
Keep it out of sight, probably a good idea

[01:58:07.720 --> 01:58:09.500]
1101 on the pole, 1101

[01:58:09.500 --> 01:58:11.740]
Oh, we're going to make 1200 crazy, you'll see

[01:58:13.220 --> 01:58:15.580]
Even on a crappy pole like this that we didn't

[01:58:15.580 --> 01:58:17.940]
I don't think Eric put it up till about seven o'clock last night

[01:58:17.940 --> 01:58:19.060]
Got kind of a late start

[01:58:19.800 --> 01:58:21.740]
And we had a premature evaluation of them

[01:58:21.740 --> 01:58:24.500]
Thinking we had like 500 and something when I sat down in this morning

[01:58:24.500 --> 01:58:26.520]
I'm thinking, oh, we're never going to make it even to 1000

[01:58:26.520 --> 01:58:28.160]
We're going to make it to 1200

[01:58:28.160 --> 01:58:31.080]
And then they will fear us, okay, like Connie would say

[01:58:31.080 --> 01:58:32.200]
Then they will fear you

[01:58:34.300 --> 01:58:36.040]
567, but the phones have really been spastic

[01:58:36.040 --> 01:58:37.540]
And more ways than one of you know what's that today?

[01:58:37.620 --> 01:58:38.380]
Oh, yeah

[01:58:38.860 --> 01:58:40.000]
More ways than one I mean

[01:58:40.720 --> 01:58:43.140]
Like now, they just go absolutely blank

[01:58:43.140 --> 01:58:46.120]
And then as soon as they catch wind or catch, you know

[01:58:47.060 --> 01:58:49.120]
Yeah, maybe that bitch is still there from woodbind

[01:58:49.120 --> 01:58:50.680]
Oh, I'm telling you

[01:58:50.680 --> 01:58:54.100]
I was not a well person, I just like, oh, I wanted to cry

[01:58:54.100 --> 01:58:57.840]
My ears are, my ears are popping and my eyes are tearing up

[01:58:57.840 --> 01:58:58.480]
Not good

[01:58:58.480 --> 01:59:02.660]
In fact, I think I think the ear here was staring to like fall out

[01:59:03.260 --> 01:59:05.800]
Ah, I sure will play if I see her again, man

[01:59:05.800 --> 01:59:08.000]
I'm playing another machine far away

[01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:08.700]
Oh, that

[01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:11.400]
567, 05, 60

[01:59:11.400 --> 01:59:13.900]
Palm 560 in the Verizon signal wireless line

[01:59:13.900 --> 01:59:15.700]
You know the interesting part of it is

[01:59:16.320 --> 01:59:19.000]
All the human cry about slot machines

[01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:20.580]
And about remember all the history

[01:59:20.580 --> 01:59:22.700]
All those years in Casino, Stan

[01:59:22.700 --> 01:59:23.840]
And everything and all the screaming

[01:59:23.840 --> 01:59:25.580]
All the elections about Casino, Gamley

[01:59:25.980 --> 01:59:28.420]
And now we finally have real honest to God

[01:59:28.420 --> 01:59:30.700]
And I'm not talking about the make-proly ones that the engines have got

[01:59:30.700 --> 01:59:34.680]
I'm talking about real honest to God slot machines at, you know, various places

[01:59:35.780 --> 01:59:37.580]
And you hear almost nothing about it

[01:59:37.580 --> 01:59:40.660]
Except a couple of schmucks that call, oh, I didn't do too good, knew it well

[01:59:40.660 --> 01:59:41.340]
You know, big deal

[01:59:41.340 --> 01:59:43.080]
Go cry on somebody else's shoulder

[01:59:43.080 --> 01:59:44.080]
But like nothing

[01:59:45.240 --> 01:59:47.500]
Now does that mean that only the old cockroaches everyone there

[01:59:47.500 --> 01:59:49.460]
Like the one guy that was giving me a song and dance about how great

[01:59:49.460 --> 01:59:50.340]
Gulsdrew used to be

[01:59:50.340 --> 01:59:51.800]
That guy was such a schmuck

[01:59:52.140 --> 01:59:53.100]
Such a shmuck

[01:59:53.100 --> 01:59:54.240]
But thank you for being here

[01:59:54.240 --> 01:59:57.160]
I beg your pardon, thank you for keeping you to Shalai

[01:59:57.160 --> 01:59:58.000]
Right, yeah

[01:59:58.500 --> 02:00:00.940]
That's why I'm using all those terms because if he looks in the mirror

[02:00:00.940 --> 02:00:03.120]
He'll see a schmuck a schmuggeggy and a schmundrick

[02:00:03.120 --> 02:00:05.080]
And a shlamazzle all rolled up into one

[02:00:05.080 --> 02:00:06.280]
Did you already say honey uncle

[02:00:06.280 --> 02:00:07.800]
And a high mionkle also

[02:00:07.800 --> 02:00:09.620]
And hopefully it's a great time at Gulsdrew

[02:00:11.340 --> 02:00:12.580]
Somebody QAM, hello

[02:00:12.980 --> 02:00:16.760]
It was Anna Nicole and Brittany in the basket

[02:00:16.760 --> 02:00:18.420]
Well Brittany by the way has just been

[02:00:18.420 --> 02:00:20.680]
She just got out of the rehab joint

[02:00:20.680 --> 02:00:22.400]
She sure wasn't in there very long, was she

[02:00:24.720 --> 02:00:28.420]
No, it was a big bullet and she's out, she's out of rehab

[02:00:28.420 --> 02:00:29.880]
No, but she was back to another one

[02:00:30.360 --> 02:00:31.140]
I beg your pardon?

[02:00:31.300 --> 02:00:33.320]
She went to another rehab clinic or something

[02:00:33.320 --> 02:00:35.380]
Pardon, she's trying to keep track, she moves fast

[02:00:35.380 --> 02:00:36.660]
Yeah, she moves it around

[02:00:36.660 --> 02:00:39.380]
Okay, and the problem with it now is that nobody really cares

[02:00:39.380 --> 02:00:40.800]
That's why she's doing all these things

[02:00:40.800 --> 02:00:42.160]
Because nobody cares

[02:00:43.020 --> 02:00:44.340]
Taint what it used to be

[02:00:45.920 --> 02:00:46.680]
WQAM, hello

[02:00:46.680 --> 02:00:47.940]
Hello, Neil

[02:00:47.940 --> 02:00:48.820]
Yes sir

[02:00:48.820 --> 02:00:49.840]
How you doing?

[02:00:50.040 --> 02:00:50.720]
This is an ex

[02:00:50.720 --> 02:00:53.120]
This is an ex resident of South Florida

[02:00:53.940 --> 02:00:54.700]
Congratulations sir

[02:00:54.700 --> 02:00:56.460]
And I moved back to Syracuse

[02:00:56.460 --> 02:00:59.100]
To tell me to bring a shovel with me about eight years ago

[02:00:59.100 --> 02:00:59.640]
So I did

[02:00:59.640 --> 02:01:02.000]
And it's one thing to be smart enough to get out of South Florida

[02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:04.020]
It's another thing to be dumb enough to move to Syracuse

[02:01:04.020 --> 02:01:04.980]
I mean, what are you fucking about?

[02:01:06.200 --> 02:01:08.200]
Well, I wanted to be right next to the town

[02:01:08.200 --> 02:01:09.720]
You know, you grew up there

[02:01:09.720 --> 02:01:10.360]
So yeah, right

[02:01:11.200 --> 02:01:13.160]
Anyways, I'm down here on vacation

[02:01:13.160 --> 02:01:15.180]
And I always turn the ad when I'm down here

[02:01:15.180 --> 02:01:17.700]
And the radio too, but anyways

[02:01:18.740 --> 02:01:20.380]
Years ago when I was down here

[02:01:20.380 --> 02:01:22.880]
You had a show and you were talking about the names

[02:01:22.880 --> 02:01:24.460]
That you know, all these people names

[02:01:25.020 --> 02:01:26.700]
All these kids funny names

[02:01:26.700 --> 02:01:27.620]
And every time you get it

[02:01:28.220 --> 02:01:30.100]
And you started it off with that football player

[02:01:30.100 --> 02:01:31.600]
And I can't think of his name right now

[02:01:32.860 --> 02:01:34.700]
And you went through all these names

[02:01:34.700 --> 02:01:36.980]
But there was one that I think you forgot

[02:01:37.840 --> 02:01:38.280]
Okay

[02:01:38.280 --> 02:01:39.740]
It was Frank

[02:01:39.740 --> 02:01:41.920]
Frank Zappas

[02:01:42.540 --> 02:01:43.840]
Kid and I was waiting

[02:01:43.840 --> 02:01:43.980]
Yeah

[02:01:43.980 --> 02:01:45.400]
Talk him on on it

[02:01:45.400 --> 02:01:47.400]
And I was waiting and waiting and waiting

[02:01:47.400 --> 02:01:49.420]
We're here to say moon you know that

[02:01:49.420 --> 02:01:51.060]
And you didn't on the show and that bus

[02:01:51.060 --> 02:01:51.800]
I'll be damned

[02:01:51.800 --> 02:01:53.760]
Well, we made up for it years later

[02:01:53.760 --> 02:01:54.480]
Look at that

[02:01:54.480 --> 02:01:54.940]
I know

[02:01:58.140 --> 02:01:58.860]
Go ahead

[02:01:58.860 --> 02:02:00.200]
You know, good to hear from you

[02:02:00.200 --> 02:02:01.100]
Or you know, here you

[02:02:01.100 --> 02:02:02.260]
I'll cut you again

[02:02:02.260 --> 02:02:03.200]
Alright sir

[02:02:03.200 --> 02:02:03.520]
Take it

[02:02:03.520 --> 02:02:04.000]
Thanks, Pally

[02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:05.080]
I'll see you in Oniata

[02:02:05.080 --> 02:02:06.600]
Yeah, you got it

[02:02:06.600 --> 02:02:06.920]
Okay

[02:02:07.300 --> 02:02:07.660]
Goodbye

[02:02:08.220 --> 02:02:10.680]
Anybody that voluntarily lives in upstate New York

[02:02:10.680 --> 02:02:11.520]
Has got to be

[02:02:11.520 --> 02:02:13.180]
Of course, he's in the, you know

[02:02:13.180 --> 02:02:14.560]
He's smart, he's in South Florida now

[02:02:14.560 --> 02:02:15.240]
He got to allow

[02:02:15.960 --> 02:02:18.820]
Do you know that they had two feet of snow

[02:02:18.820 --> 02:02:20.680]
And I was thinking, oh, okay, that's enough

[02:02:20.680 --> 02:02:21.980]
This boy and now

[02:02:21.980 --> 02:02:23.860]
My car is fast

[02:02:23.860 --> 02:02:25.800]
My teeth is shiny

[02:02:25.800 --> 02:02:29.340]
I tell all the girls they can kiss my high name

[02:02:29.340 --> 02:02:30.080]
And kiss

[02:02:31.960 --> 02:02:33.280]
See what's wrong with this

[02:02:33.280 --> 02:02:34.140]
Nothing

[02:02:34.140 --> 02:02:34.420]
Nothing

[02:02:34.420 --> 02:02:36.240]
I just can't believe that we found this

[02:02:37.060 --> 02:02:38.740]
Sure, fact-fanny man

[02:02:38.740 --> 02:02:40.300]
It was one of my favorite songs

[02:02:40.300 --> 02:02:41.160]
When I was a kid

[02:02:41.160 --> 02:02:42.120]
I had them all, you know

[02:02:42.120 --> 02:02:43.540]
I had all the 45s

[02:02:43.540 --> 02:02:43.780]
Yeah

[02:02:43.780 --> 02:02:45.920]
I had those little curing cases, you know

[02:02:45.920 --> 02:02:46.860]
And you'd have

[02:02:46.860 --> 02:02:49.720]
Like little numbers that you'd put on each song

[02:02:49.720 --> 02:02:51.160]
You know, you had like an index

[02:02:51.160 --> 02:02:53.400]
I had two 45s

[02:02:55.120 --> 02:02:56.580]
Well, they were kind of fading out

[02:02:56.580 --> 02:02:59.300]
You know, as I started collecting and buying records

[02:02:59.300 --> 02:03:01.020]
Was one of them not fading away by Buddy Holly

[02:03:01.020 --> 02:03:01.820]
I sure don't know

[02:03:01.820 --> 02:03:03.280]
Monster Mash and

[02:03:03.280 --> 02:03:05.240]
Bungle in the jungle by Jethro Telf

[02:03:05.240 --> 02:03:07.000]
Oh my god, you can't say that

[02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:07.980]
Bungle in the jungle

[02:03:07.980 --> 02:03:09.120]
What is wrong with you

[02:03:09.120 --> 02:03:10.140]
Oh my god, are you mind or what

[02:03:10.140 --> 02:03:11.000]
You're going to get joist

[02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:12.060]
Bungle by ass

[02:03:12.060 --> 02:03:13.160]
No thanks

[02:03:13.160 --> 02:03:16.000]
But anyway, I had the two of the little curing cases

[02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:17.280]
You see that, well that's that's so

[02:03:17.280 --> 02:03:18.620]
And the 50s

[02:03:18.620 --> 02:03:19.640]
Mid-late 50s

[02:03:19.640 --> 02:03:20.800]
That every kid had that

[02:03:20.800 --> 02:03:21.600]
Uh-huh

[02:03:21.600 --> 02:03:22.720]
I had like a little index

[02:03:22.720 --> 02:03:24.040]
And you'd write the names of the song

[02:03:24.040 --> 02:03:25.280]
And they all had like little stickers

[02:03:25.280 --> 02:03:27.000]
With numbers one true, you know

[02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:28.740]
However many with the case would carry

[02:03:28.740 --> 02:03:30.280]
Uh, 30, 40, 50

[02:03:30.280 --> 02:03:30.960]
I would say

[02:03:30.960 --> 02:03:31.860]
BOT 3rd man

[02:03:31.860 --> 02:03:33.120]
Pityful curing

[02:03:35.020 --> 02:03:35.860]
Bungle in the jungle

[02:03:35.860 --> 02:03:36.780]
Oh yeah

[02:03:38.660 --> 02:03:39.740]
End of Monster Mash

[02:03:39.740 --> 02:03:40.780]
And this one George just

[02:03:40.780 --> 02:03:42.720]
Tastes the music started going really downhill fade

[02:03:42.720 --> 02:03:43.480]
Yeah that's right

[02:03:44.060 --> 02:03:45.200]
That must have been it

[02:03:48.440 --> 02:03:50.700]
Another one that Elvis ripped off by the way

[02:03:50.700 --> 02:03:52.480]
Not that we want to pick on Elvis who's been dead

[02:03:52.480 --> 02:03:54.300]
But why not now, let's do it

[02:03:54.300 --> 02:03:56.540]
Oh no, I'm not allowed allowed allowed

[02:03:56.540 --> 02:03:57.460]
And this part

[02:03:59.460 --> 02:04:02.260]
Very slowly good to me

[02:04:02.260 --> 02:04:03.660]
Now let me ask you one question

[02:04:03.660 --> 02:04:04.900]
I don't want to sound like an old fart

[02:04:04.900 --> 02:04:06.900]
Like an old, funny, bloody, staggy old fart

[02:04:06.900 --> 02:04:07.380]
Even the lines

[02:04:07.380 --> 02:04:07.720]
Too late

[02:04:07.720 --> 02:04:09.740]
Well I'm thinking of starting making some of the music you get

[02:04:11.160 --> 02:04:12.640]
I keep winning too

[02:04:12.640 --> 02:04:13.700]
Is that could ever happen?

[02:04:13.960 --> 02:04:16.780]
I'll make you a CD of modern music

[02:04:16.780 --> 02:04:18.080]
That you're not hearing on the radio

[02:04:18.080 --> 02:04:18.860]
That's

[02:04:18.860 --> 02:04:19.680]
I don't listen to the radio

[02:04:19.680 --> 02:04:20.240]
I know

[02:04:20.900 --> 02:04:22.180]
So you never hear it anyway

[02:04:22.180 --> 02:04:24.020]
That quote unquote good

[02:04:24.020 --> 02:04:24.900]
It's actually good

[02:04:24.900 --> 02:04:26.800]
So just pretend a good looking guy is singing it

[02:04:26.800 --> 02:04:27.440]
And you'll like it

[02:04:27.440 --> 02:04:28.080]
Oh okay

[02:04:28.080 --> 02:04:29.060]
That would work for me

[02:04:29.580 --> 02:04:31.300]
Pretty boy picture on the front

[02:04:31.300 --> 02:04:32.460]
Oh pretty boy

[02:04:32.460 --> 02:04:33.280]
I see

[02:04:33.280 --> 02:04:35.380]
I'm gonna have to find the music channels on here

[02:04:35.380 --> 02:04:36.300]
Although the only problem

[02:04:36.300 --> 02:04:37.700]
Now we encountered this once before

[02:04:37.700 --> 02:04:39.800]
Is that some of these music channels

[02:04:39.800 --> 02:04:41.320]
If you have some of that subrosal language

[02:04:41.320 --> 02:04:42.540]
You know if you know what I'm from

[02:04:42.540 --> 02:04:43.340]
I do know

[02:04:46.160 --> 02:04:46.860]
Uh oh

[02:04:46.860 --> 02:04:47.980]
Number 11 is

[02:04:47.980 --> 02:04:49.080]
Walk right through

[02:04:49.620 --> 02:04:50.660]
All the stings

[02:04:50.660 --> 02:04:51.620]
All the bottles

[02:04:51.620 --> 02:04:52.540]
And whatever they through

[02:04:52.540 --> 02:04:54.060]
We have one of major vectors

[02:04:57.060 --> 02:04:58.960]
Oh it's a PSA on much music

[02:04:58.960 --> 02:04:59.760]
Much more music

[02:04:59.760 --> 02:05:01.880]
Never doubt that this long group can maintain it

[02:05:04.180 --> 02:05:06.240]
Making us use debut all the way up

[02:05:06.240 --> 02:05:07.240]
In the 15th position

[02:05:07.240 --> 02:05:08.440]
Nika and his track

[02:05:08.440 --> 02:05:09.220]
Grace Kelly

[02:05:09.220 --> 02:05:10.420]
Jim Pettie's tune

[02:05:10.420 --> 02:05:12.040]
Pulling through is losing ground

[02:05:12.040 --> 02:05:13.180]
This week dropping two

[02:05:13.180 --> 02:05:14.540]
Their pool number 14

[02:05:14.540 --> 02:05:16.760]
Also taking a trip in the wrong direction

[02:05:16.760 --> 02:05:18.300]
Headly down four slots

[02:05:18.300 --> 02:05:20.060]
The lucky number 13 with Gunn

[02:05:20.060 --> 02:05:22.040]
The philosopher's teams are creeping up

[02:05:22.040 --> 02:05:24.040]
Beautiful creature rises to number 12

[02:05:24.040 --> 02:05:25.900]
And making a big jump this week

[02:05:25.900 --> 02:05:27.360]
Four positions to number 11

[02:05:27.360 --> 02:05:29.060]
It's Nickelback that it's everyone's hair

[02:05:29.060 --> 02:05:31.280]
Stick around the top 10 trash and the ticier

[02:05:31.280 --> 02:05:32.020]
Coming up next

[02:05:32.020 --> 02:05:33.660]
Oh man I'm staying on this thing man

[02:05:33.660 --> 02:05:34.900]
How would that end the cult garbage

[02:05:34.900 --> 02:05:36.120]
Okay, and that stupid publicity

[02:05:36.120 --> 02:05:37.560]
Seeking the jerk judge

[02:05:37.560 --> 02:05:37.980]
You know

[02:05:38.520 --> 02:05:39.540]
Who needs that crap

[02:05:39.540 --> 02:05:40.640]
Oh we got the top 10

[02:05:40.640 --> 02:05:42.080]
And the much more music count down

[02:05:43.520 --> 02:05:45.020]
You don't sound too excited about it

[02:05:45.020 --> 02:05:46.440]
Cause you never get excited about anything

[02:05:46.940 --> 02:05:48.320]
Oh I like that idea

[02:05:50.780 --> 02:05:52.520]
How about Vizzy Ms. Luzzy

[02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:54.120]
I don't think I know that

[02:06:07.620 --> 02:06:08.340]
Oh right

[02:06:09.200 --> 02:06:10.740]
A picture picket in the middle

[02:06:10.740 --> 02:06:11.940]
Forever was picking

[02:06:12.500 --> 02:06:14.620]
You taking it to the best living

[02:06:15.960 --> 02:06:17.340]
And good jolly Ms. Molly

[02:06:17.340 --> 02:06:18.600]
And Vizzy Ms. Luzzy

[02:06:20.360 --> 02:06:21.460]
Was all good stuff though

[02:06:21.460 --> 02:06:21.920]
Was all good

[02:06:21.920 --> 02:06:23.400]
Love 113 votes on the pool

[02:06:23.400 --> 02:06:25.660]
We're shooting for 1200 by two o'clock today

[02:06:25.660 --> 02:06:27.180]
I got my shirt on my shoes

[02:06:28.040 --> 02:06:29.300]
And then during the break I think

[02:06:29.300 --> 02:06:30.120]
And I don't have my shoes

[02:06:30.120 --> 02:06:31.180]
I got my pantaloonies on

[02:06:31.180 --> 02:06:31.420]
Second

[02:06:31.420 --> 02:06:33.020]
I'm so old I can't even tell the difference

[02:06:33.020 --> 02:06:34.520]
Between my shoes and my pantaloonies

[02:06:34.520 --> 02:06:36.540]
Wait till I start sticking my pants on my feet

[02:06:37.440 --> 02:06:38.300]
That won't be good

[02:06:38.740 --> 02:06:40.500]
And these are those quarter-rules, they're just

[02:06:40.500 --> 02:06:42.340]
Oh window in the skies by you too

[02:06:42.340 --> 02:06:43.400]
And wonder what are we going to physically

[02:06:45.300 --> 02:06:46.040]
They're going to send you

[02:06:46.040 --> 02:06:48.000]
They're going to send you is not stuff that you'll see on there

[02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:48.880]
Oh not

[02:06:48.880 --> 02:06:50.060]
But anyway that wasn't too bad

[02:06:50.060 --> 02:06:51.660]
For you too I think it was sensational

[02:06:51.660 --> 02:06:52.940]
Cause I'll eat you too

[02:06:52.940 --> 02:06:55.040]
Oh god I can't stand you too

[02:06:55.780 --> 02:06:57.460]
And that Bono if I ever have to see

[02:06:57.460 --> 02:06:58.440]
Is it going to be posted again

[02:06:58.440 --> 02:06:59.360]
I mean I just mean just

[02:06:59.360 --> 02:07:01.000]
My whole head may spin off

[02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:01.820]
But nevertheless

[02:07:03.480 --> 02:07:04.660]
You're going to send me music

[02:07:05.500 --> 02:07:08.240]
Yeah let me get some good stuff together though

[02:07:08.240 --> 02:07:09.420]
I'm going to choose very carefully

[02:07:09.980 --> 02:07:10.420]
Hahaha

[02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:11.760]
Oh okay

[02:07:12.460 --> 02:07:13.860]
I'm holding my breath on this

[02:07:13.860 --> 02:07:14.820]
What are you playing now

[02:07:14.820 --> 02:07:15.580]
You too

[02:07:16.180 --> 02:07:17.320]
Oh don't do it

[02:07:17.320 --> 02:07:17.540]
Please

[02:07:17.540 --> 02:07:20.060]
I need with the Swedish tape at number 8 on the countdown

[02:07:31.820 --> 02:07:33.920]
You know the word catterwalling

[02:07:33.920 --> 02:07:34.400]
Yes

[02:07:34.400 --> 02:07:35.200]
Woo

[02:07:37.140 --> 02:07:37.660]
Yeah

[02:07:38.980 --> 02:07:41.600]
I was the first to ball in the show

[02:07:41.600 --> 02:07:44.220]
Oh man I was that some heavy duty crap or what huh

[02:07:45.280 --> 02:07:47.020]
Underline of course the operative word

[02:07:47.020 --> 02:07:47.960]
Yep that's the one

[02:07:47.960 --> 02:07:48.440]
Wow

[02:07:48.440 --> 02:07:50.160]
And just a word for your rhythm

[02:07:50.160 --> 02:07:52.680]
And it's got everything I've been making the poem

[02:07:53.340 --> 02:07:54.800]
If I can get

[02:07:55.480 --> 02:07:56.860]
And we breathe

[02:07:56.860 --> 02:07:57.780]
And I

[02:07:58.380 --> 02:08:00.260]
Like I said I'm going back to Amos and BC

[02:08:00.260 --> 02:08:02.340]
And going back to the real Amos I can't take no more of that

[02:08:02.340 --> 02:08:03.740]
It's just it's just not my thing

[02:08:03.740 --> 02:08:04.300]
You know I'm saying

[02:08:05.240 --> 02:08:06.540]
Maybe it hasn't an old funny dirty

[02:08:06.540 --> 02:08:07.680]
Or maybe because it sucks

[02:08:07.680 --> 02:08:08.780]
Maybe that's part of the reason

[02:08:08.780 --> 02:08:09.280]
It sucks

[02:08:09.280 --> 02:08:09.940]
Oh

[02:08:10.960 --> 02:08:12.400]
I mean I'm gay

[02:08:12.400 --> 02:08:13.920]
I mean game for a good new hub

[02:08:13.920 --> 02:08:15.900]
Any uh you know any uh any genre

[02:08:15.900 --> 02:08:16.980]
Whatever the hell it is

[02:08:16.980 --> 02:08:17.960]
But uh that ain't it

[02:08:18.600 --> 02:08:19.760]
That definitely ain't it

[02:08:20.820 --> 02:08:22.160]
1120 uh let me refresh

[02:08:22.160 --> 02:08:24.120]
Okay I don't want to give you an old outdated number

[02:08:24.120 --> 02:08:24.820]
That would be bad

[02:08:25.660 --> 02:08:26.760]
Let's get it right up to date

[02:08:27.620 --> 02:08:28.680]
1129 on a pull me is

[02:08:28.680 --> 02:08:31.460]
We need 71 in 58 minutes for 1200 votes

[02:08:31.460 --> 02:08:32.960]
And on a really bad pull

[02:08:32.960 --> 02:08:35.080]
I apologize for I don't know what's wrong with this pull

[02:08:35.080 --> 02:08:38.920]
I mean it's not it's not one of the best

[02:08:39.580 --> 02:08:41.480]
But it certainly is not one I would be

[02:08:41.480 --> 02:08:42.980]
You know I'm pitching and belly aching

[02:08:42.980 --> 02:08:44.320]
And carrying on and screaming

[02:08:44.320 --> 02:08:45.220]
You know what I care about

[02:08:45.220 --> 02:08:46.640]
And running up and down a hallway

[02:08:46.640 --> 02:08:47.400]
And the dropping

[02:08:47.400 --> 02:08:48.860]
What what do you care about

[02:08:48.860 --> 02:08:50.580]
That I didn't have to come up with it

[02:08:50.580 --> 02:08:52.020]
Right me me too

[02:08:52.680 --> 02:08:55.040]
Look we've gotten 75,000

[02:08:55.040 --> 02:08:56.160]
I've got a pile here man

[02:08:56.160 --> 02:08:57.120]
Halfway to the ceiling

[02:08:57.120 --> 02:08:58.100]
Thank the Lord

[02:08:58.100 --> 02:08:58.900]
Thank uh

[02:08:58.900 --> 02:08:59.580]
Damn God

[02:08:59.580 --> 02:09:00.920]
And I'm real happy about that

[02:09:00.920 --> 02:09:02.500]
Because the only difficult part about doing the show

[02:09:02.500 --> 02:09:03.980]
Is coming up with a different pull every day

[02:09:03.980 --> 02:09:04.720]
And then he won

[02:09:04.720 --> 02:09:06.040]
I repeated the body wash one

[02:09:06.040 --> 02:09:07.660]
Which we hadn't done in a very long time

[02:09:07.660 --> 02:09:09.040]
Josh Cordis on Friday

[02:09:09.040 --> 02:09:10.400]
Ripped me a major ass

[02:09:10.400 --> 02:09:11.840]
Didn't he Chris he was ripping me all day

[02:09:11.840 --> 02:09:13.920]
Yeah well he was kind of sad that he had to come back

[02:09:13.920 --> 02:09:16.080]
Cause he's in rehab right now to lose his gainess

[02:09:17.320 --> 02:09:18.880]
Oh I see I forgot about that

[02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:21.180]

With all that animal calling the stuff with the body

[02:09:45.080 --> 02:09:46.780]
Would you ever do a tiny body

[02:09:47.360 --> 02:09:48.180]

[02:09:49.440 --> 02:09:50.800]
Putting the put a little basket

[02:09:50.800 --> 02:09:51.900]

Anyone know why because the lights went up the internet's dead

[02:10:07.720 --> 02:10:08.920]
Oh no just came back

[02:10:08.920 --> 02:10:12.220]
The internet is farting today I sure hope joys doesn't get wind of that

[02:10:13.080 --> 02:10:14.700]
The internet is farting one second

[02:10:14.700 --> 02:10:15.820]
Say one second it's not

[02:10:15.820 --> 02:10:20.000]
We apologize profusely to the audience but there's nothing we can do because it's WQAM

[02:10:20.580 --> 02:10:23.480]
And because one thing let me say this to you and you know it's true

[02:10:24.180 --> 02:10:27.140]
One thing that jolly joe don't know from and that's technical

[02:10:27.140 --> 02:10:30.960]
I mean he couldn't care less whether line one ever works again

[02:10:30.960 --> 02:10:34.680]
Whether we can make this thing uh this box thing ever worked

[02:10:34.680 --> 02:10:37.760]
Way used to uh you know it used to be uh fantastic right

[02:10:37.760 --> 02:10:39.340]
Used to be like I was sitting right there

[02:10:40.040 --> 02:10:42.880]
Not no no and he just doesn't care about these things you know

[02:10:42.880 --> 02:10:45.080]
Don't bother him with that we got to get that building up

[02:10:45.080 --> 02:10:48.060]
Get the building up get the revenue up get the bottom line up

[02:10:48.060 --> 02:10:50.140]
That's what they're getting it up that's all they care about

[02:10:51.360 --> 02:10:52.000]
WQAM hello

Listen uh here you're talking about singles and uh you grew up

[02:11:00.500 --> 02:11:04.880]
About putting singles in a in a little box back in the old days right 45

[02:11:05.740 --> 02:11:10.480]
45 and uh I just read uh that all record companies will see

[02:11:10.480 --> 02:11:13.060]
Making uh singles by the end of the year

[02:11:14.300 --> 02:11:16.080]
In a format

[02:11:16.800 --> 02:11:20.600]
Well let me ask you this why would anybody what wouldn't mean making singles you mean the on CDs

[02:11:21.400 --> 02:11:26.080]
CD singles vinyl singles well what kind of a communist bunch of crap is that

[02:11:26.880 --> 02:11:28.100]
That's uh consolidation

[02:11:28.620 --> 02:11:29.800]

They're all gone yeah, I'm sure that

[02:11:37.740 --> 02:11:41.880]
You can go to like a big best buy or you know one of those uh gigantic box stores

[02:11:41.880 --> 02:11:48.580]
Yeah box do we get a box okay thanks for the bad news paling it's just another example of the degradation of the quality of human life

[02:11:48.580 --> 02:11:49.100]
That's bad

[02:11:50.600 --> 02:11:57.740]
In fact when you go into like the big record stores here like uh HMV and Sam's you can a you're almost can't even find the a CD singles

I just have to play this as a DJ

[02:12:56.740 --> 02:13:01.120]
Start slow and it goes downhill from there no actually I think so. It's good. It's all right

[02:13:01.120 --> 02:13:06.420]
I mean it's cool. I'm 37 on the pole. We need 70 three votes in 52 minutes even a child

[02:13:06.820 --> 02:13:10.080]

More than a hundred thousand positions. She hugged me and said mr. President. I believe that we should

[02:17:37.160 --> 02:17:40.780]
She wanted to bend over backwards quietly, but with gathering force

[02:17:40.780 --> 02:17:46.860]

1164 on a pole what's the reaction you get when you tell other people to listen to Neil?

[02:19:19.360 --> 02:19:20.240]
Who's Neil Rogers?

[02:19:21.060 --> 02:19:23.500]
290 that to me that's the worst shot, you know

[02:19:23.500 --> 02:19:25.820]
So I think if they hate you I can deal with that who cares

[02:19:25.820 --> 02:19:30.640]
But if they don't know you if they just ignore you and Chris is all everybody loves you Neil

[02:19:31.440 --> 02:19:35.340]
You're what you said before when George was on the arcane. Yeah, well you're legendary, so

[02:19:36.800 --> 02:19:40.580]
I don't tell anyone I listen to Neil 143 and probably a real good policy

[02:19:41.100 --> 02:19:43.520]
Only told to our friends at arbitrage please

[02:19:44.100 --> 02:19:49.160]
All right, so do I 130 130 people say oh so do I all right

[02:19:49.780 --> 02:19:56.640]
I can't stand that bastard 98 meaning me that best start girl that piece of crap that subhuman swill douche

[02:19:57.580 --> 02:20:01.480]
He's still on I thought he retired or died 70 uh some 76

[02:20:02.160 --> 02:20:07.960]
You like Neil too. I love him. He's the center of my universe. I want to meet him stock him do him be him uh 68

[02:20:08.540 --> 02:20:16.540]
80 the greatest 58 that's cool 48. I hate this pull 46 only 3.9 percent all of George would like to increase that

[02:20:17.080 --> 02:20:18.800]
Yeah, I don't think it's that bad

[02:20:19.780 --> 02:20:25.820]
You tell me listen to Neil. They go why 46 say why why do you listen laughter?

[02:20:26.880 --> 02:20:27.920]
46 also

[02:20:28.520 --> 02:20:32.820]
You FM County Pinto 41 when's he on what station 35?

[02:20:34.240 --> 02:20:36.060]
Why do you listen to a fact 21

[02:20:36.660 --> 02:20:39.940]
Uh, if you get away from me 14 if you and all the other

[02:20:39.940 --> 02:20:45.660]
Expo this and why do you listen to an atheist Solanethe Sinkos old time for chinkway only five

[02:20:46.260 --> 02:20:52.280]
And that's because we've taste all the religious geth fees waiting. You know what I'm glad. I'm I'm delighted because I can't I can't view with those people

[02:20:52.280 --> 02:20:56.940]
I cannot stand like a couple days ago. Remember that Bible temperate I called him with that crap. Oh

[02:20:58.500 --> 02:21:06.080]
It's it just it makes me nauseous why haven't you got I realized that most of you were raised in families where they a coast from one generation

[02:21:06.080 --> 02:21:11.660]
Of another and they pass along the brainwashing of the the fathers and the mothers and the uh grandparent and whoever else

[02:21:11.660 --> 02:21:16.500]
But why don't you have enough brains of your own to say this is a bunch of crap

[02:21:17.280 --> 02:21:20.480]
This is a waste of time. This doesn't make any sense

[02:21:21.660 --> 02:21:23.660]
Why can't they do that? It's very difficult

[02:21:24.640 --> 02:21:25.840]
Was easy for me

[02:21:26.540 --> 02:21:32.040]
Well, it wasn't easy for me, but I did it anyway. Well good for you. That's right. You were you were involved in all those like

[02:22:12.440 --> 02:22:17.020]

[02:22:21.800 --> 02:22:26.500]
Well, the coins your hands get black. Who would have wants to posky with those coins. No, he's just gonna tick it

[02:22:26.500 --> 02:22:30.100]
Okay, most of the places are like that now correct. Yeah, that is correct

[02:22:30.100 --> 02:22:31.400]
All right, the only ones I

[02:22:33.600 --> 02:22:35.540]
No, not big is they got coins

[02:22:36.820 --> 02:22:41.940]
Are you sure? Yes, I was just a couple weeks ago and they're still using coins

[02:22:41.940 --> 02:22:45.560]
Yeah, you still are coins or dollars or dollars or five or five? Yep

You know somebody won five million on the damn mega bucks last week and I wasn't even looking

[02:22:59.500 --> 02:23:00.600]
I don't think it was a woodbind

[02:23:00.600 --> 02:23:03.780]
Because all the all the racinos through Ontario are connected

[02:23:05.120 --> 02:23:10.960]
And I should also tell you that the um lotto jack pot tonight is 14 million and they write to a check for 14 million

[02:23:10.960 --> 02:23:12.740]
Of course, it's only 14 million Canadian

[02:23:13.720 --> 02:23:17.060]
Which you know times eighty eighty six cents. What's that 86?

[02:23:17.440 --> 02:23:19.520]
And not too bad. It's not too shabby, right?

[02:23:19.880 --> 02:23:23.040]
Not too shabby. They're about nine million ten minutes something like that US

[02:23:24.340 --> 02:23:29.380]
So if I win the 14 million tonight then tomorrow Georgia beyond and Friday and for a while

[02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:34.020]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 and they've rising singular wireless line

[02:23:34.820 --> 02:23:36.060]
WQ a m hello

[02:23:36.560 --> 02:23:43.460]
Dear god. Yes, sir. How are you today excellent? I am a hetero male that uses body wash

[02:23:43.460 --> 02:23:46.740]
Thanks to you all right really thanks to me, huh?

[02:23:46.900 --> 02:23:51.600]
For your e-well, well no it was it was what is the year ago or so you got all that thing and I was like

[02:23:51.600 --> 02:23:54.680]
What's this guy talking about now try it and I never turn back sure?

[02:23:54.720 --> 02:23:58.160]
Why would anybody after using see? I think I think you made a good point that is that

[02:23:58.160 --> 02:24:01.140]
The guys out there who are reluctant to try it

[02:24:01.140 --> 02:24:03.160]
They're still doing the show but if they try it once

[02:24:03.160 --> 02:24:08.460]
They realize it's not some kind of a pansy thing or it's not some kind of a it's not they're not gonna smell like a lilacs or roses

[02:24:08.460 --> 02:24:10.460]
Then they would stick with it

[02:24:10.460 --> 02:24:12.560]
You were talking about taking a bath the other day

[02:24:12.560 --> 02:24:17.620]
I can't remember the last time I actually got into a bath felt that's the most gross discussing thing

[02:24:17.620 --> 02:24:23.480]
I can think of the only the last times that I got into a bath tub when it's been years is when like if you have bad hemorrhoids

[02:24:23.480 --> 02:24:27.460]
You know and you're gonna soak your roids in like a like what my mother used to call a zits bath

[02:24:27.460 --> 02:24:32.440]
You know when you only fill up the bathtub with real hot water like a very you know small to cover your

[02:24:32.440 --> 02:24:33.840]
rectum ass so to speak you know

[02:24:34.440 --> 02:24:35.980]
Well fortunately I've never had to do that

[02:24:35.980 --> 02:24:38.980]
Hey listen you were also a while ago

[02:24:39.560 --> 02:24:43.640]
Talking about a leafa as opposed to a lufa what is a leafa?

[02:24:43.900 --> 02:24:45.320]
It's just a it's just a brand name

[02:24:45.960 --> 02:24:47.400]
Oh it's a brand name okay

[02:24:47.960 --> 02:24:50.280]

He's pondering my last part

[02:24:56.420 --> 02:24:57.880]
Yeah I will remember his head

[02:24:58.440 --> 02:25:01.620]
No he got it he got it what what is wrong he was a good guy

[02:25:01.620 --> 02:25:05.260]
He's one of our very few real colors we had all day and you're not gonna guy man

[02:25:05.260 --> 02:25:08.760]
You are a hard ass. I think you're learning from George. Yep. He was good

[02:25:10.440 --> 02:25:14.680]
1176 and I talked him in the using body wash see that see how easy that was you made him gay

[02:25:15.420 --> 02:25:19.760]
Yeah, I'm a turned him gay all I had to do was just mention and all of a sudden he was just like gay poof

[02:25:19.760 --> 02:25:20.820]
You know like that poofter

[02:25:22.360 --> 02:25:22.740]
1170

[02:25:23.500 --> 02:25:27.080]
Remember that sound poof the magic dragon always dragon it

[02:25:27.660 --> 02:25:30.120]
Only 20 team more votes to 1200 this is gonna be easy

[02:25:30.120 --> 02:25:36.320]
I thought it was gonna be a real real knockdown you know some of those that go right down to the very end and we I think only one time

[02:25:37.060 --> 02:25:40.880]
Since we've been doing this all these stuff. Yeah, and we ever missed

[02:25:41.440 --> 02:25:43.560]
Are they now are they all I think one of them is dead

[02:25:44.440 --> 02:25:45.160]
Paul Stookie

[02:25:46.180 --> 02:25:49.540]
Peter Yerrow and Mary Travers one of them is dead

[02:25:51.560 --> 02:25:53.500]
And which one is it I don't know

[02:25:54.020 --> 02:25:55.500]
So I'm married Travers though is it?

[02:25:55.620 --> 02:25:56.240]
I still want

[02:25:57.600 --> 02:26:03.720]
I lost track a lot of people on the like those were the days man early 60s folk music brothers for Peter Paul and Mary

[02:26:04.160 --> 02:26:07.580]
Oh god music class in school. It was always Peter Hall and Mary's

[02:26:07.580 --> 02:26:13.260]
And they would eat just the strumming it. He's a key. How about don't think twice. It's all right if you got that

[02:26:13.260 --> 02:26:15.280]
Well, I wouldn't I'd get the emotional if you had that

[02:26:17.160 --> 02:26:20.600]
Written by Bob Dylan like most of the stuff by if I had a hammer all the crap

[02:26:20.600 --> 02:26:24.460]
But don't think twice. It's all right. Well, that was really I don't have that. Oh

[02:26:24.460 --> 02:26:26.460]
Geez Jesus Pete

[02:26:27.020 --> 02:26:27.880]
I've bloated the wind

[02:26:28.640 --> 02:26:32.000]
You can't you can't say that you can say in the wind

[02:26:33.680 --> 02:26:35.360]
And I can barely hear it

[02:26:36.300 --> 02:26:37.780]
But I could still talk about

[02:26:42.500 --> 02:26:47.100]
See Dylan wrote great stuff it just had a shot and told him hey Bobby you can't rock on more music

[02:26:47.100 --> 02:26:48.840]
You can't sing Bobby okay

[02:26:51.080 --> 02:26:51.500]
You know

[02:26:51.500 --> 02:26:53.820]
You're annoying ridiculous and people are laughing at you, you know

[02:26:53.820 --> 02:26:57.780]
But he didn't care and he made a lot of money. I do it in more power to him with the schnauz like that

[02:26:57.780 --> 02:27:01.020]
He was brilliant though. He could really write some crap god

[02:27:02.260 --> 02:27:08.060]
This is I with this dude the autopsy is set for tomorrow to determine what killed and in the cold Smith

[02:27:08.060 --> 02:27:12.060]
Like her life her career also had its ups and downs

[02:27:12.060 --> 02:27:13.700]
I'm doing a part of me

[02:27:14.300 --> 02:27:18.860]
1994 she married an 89 year old oil tycoon died a year later

[02:27:19.980 --> 02:27:23.320]
In 2002 she started her own reality TV series

[02:27:23.320 --> 02:27:27.900]
This is kind of scary for sure but by the late 90s her figure had changed

[02:27:27.900 --> 02:27:33.820]
She lost weight again and more recently became the spokeswoman for the Diet Product Trim Spa

[02:27:33.820 --> 02:27:35.540]
Chris Soma Billy Wright

[02:27:35.540 --> 02:27:39.800]
It's no secret Smith loved the limelight and she passed him it off

[02:27:39.800 --> 02:27:46.880]
He'll pass through up my dinner Smith's world changed dramatically with the birth of her daughter Danny Lynn last fall

[02:27:46.880 --> 02:27:54.760]
If you have the pp n l the night here's my toilet Smith will remain in the media over the controversy surrounding her daughter's paternity

[02:27:54.760 --> 02:28:01.040]
And in a poor way Stanley dies and two girls and a dog the result of her autopsy should provide some answers

[02:28:01.040 --> 02:28:03.120]
Put your bitch in and eat your pizza

[02:28:04.260 --> 02:28:08.620]
So mommy was on it. They just showed her on a witness stand, you know mommy. Yeah fat whore

[02:28:08.620 --> 02:28:13.940]
Oh brother another trailer trash big crazy crazy bitch for an animal cool anybody care about this

[02:28:13.940 --> 02:28:18.300]
Not if you're in your right mind, you know, but they're sure they're drowning us in a sea of this swill

[02:28:18.300 --> 02:28:20.740]
That's that's what they're famous for. That's what the media does best

[02:28:21.280 --> 02:28:25.420]
They take relatively unimportant things and they just just bury you in it

[02:28:25.420 --> 02:28:30.720]
You just you just drowning in it. You smell it you you taste it. It's all over you

[02:28:30.720 --> 02:28:34.640]
It's in your mouth. It's under your armpits. It's in your every up for your body

[02:28:36.320 --> 02:28:40.540]

Yeah, some people might be very interested if you google it it works with

[02:30:27.900 --> 02:30:30.940]
Bell Express view and the dish network

[02:30:32.240 --> 02:30:38.000]
Well, what is it? What do you mean it works with it? What does that mean? Well, I'm not saying that I got it, but you catch all the channels for free

[02:30:39.680 --> 02:30:44.320]
So in other instances the way to steal signals that what you're doing you're telling the audience how to steal signals on a

[02:30:44.320 --> 02:30:45.960]
It's free-to-air. It's legal

[02:30:46.740 --> 02:30:47.860]
Yeah, I'm serious

But right now I got my shoes on my shirt my pantaloonies

[02:31:11.860 --> 02:31:14.820]
See I got my lucky coin in my winter jacket there

[02:31:15.480 --> 02:31:18.300]
Look it looks pretty toasty to me from where I'm sitting now. It's sunny

[02:31:18.800 --> 02:31:23.780]
In fact if anything it's too damn hot in here because this building is all geared up for the brutal look at that

[02:31:23.780 --> 02:31:29.140]
38 degrees man 38 freaking degrees fair us felt fair and high whatever that is

[02:31:30.580 --> 02:31:34.620]
Not too bad. I do think boy. That's really cool. You know something like I told you that they get used to it

[02:31:34.620 --> 02:31:39.780]
Sure when it's been like 15 and 10 and the 18 for a long time and all of a sudden it gets to be 30

[02:31:39.780 --> 02:31:42.120]
It's like a freaking heat wave and and yesterday

[02:31:42.120 --> 02:31:46.260]
It was 40 and there's guys walking around with no jacket on I'm thinking

[02:31:46.840 --> 02:31:51.280]
Crazy people then and they're like not even not even breaking this web so to speak

I don't know if you guys already mentioned this or call call it called in

Actually using the application that they fell out for the insurance

[02:32:24.720 --> 02:32:27.900]
And they think they're right on their educational level

[02:32:28.440 --> 02:32:31.200]
And there's a whole bunch of people soon. I don't know if you heard about that or not

[02:32:31.200 --> 02:32:34.080]
I did not but I don't have gyco insurance anyway so I could care less

[02:32:34.080 --> 02:32:37.180]
I just enjoy their spots. You know, I'm not one of those people that's gonna be able to hold

[02:32:37.180 --> 02:32:42.040]
Yeah, I like this spot. Oh, I got you. I just don't know. Thanks for the bad news

[02:32:44.460 --> 02:32:45.220]

I don't even know that you don't screen your calls. I don't get it

[02:32:55.240 --> 02:32:59.320]
Hey, I'm a head-of-roll male and I use body wash because of you also

[02:32:59.320 --> 02:33:05.820]
Okay, now, it doesn't go the impact the impact of your attorney is unbelievable man. It is shocking. Hey, is George there?

[02:33:07.340 --> 02:33:10.320]
Now he's passed on the floor. Yeah, he's there. Hey George

[02:33:10.940 --> 02:33:15.840]
That band that you were talking about the Vincent Black shadow. Yes

[02:33:16.300 --> 02:33:21.360]
Yeah, great band. Yeah, he's playing up in West Palm Beach somewhere at the end of March over at RAZ

[02:33:21.920 --> 02:33:23.760]
We'll get me some free tickets and I'll go

[02:33:23.760 --> 02:33:29.540]
I said to give you free tickets for my band so thumbs up hardware months on Saturday night

[02:33:29.540 --> 02:33:31.540]
Well, do I blew it? I missed it

All right, thanks. That's all I got. Thanks, paling and thanks for advance for our judges free tickets

[02:33:35.820 --> 02:33:41.900]

[02:33:43.640 --> 02:33:47.840]
Oh, I don't know here on the radio. I mean eight more votes in 22 minutes like I said

[02:33:48.800 --> 02:33:50.640]
Even a fixed vote could do it

[02:33:51.940 --> 02:33:58.300]
Even John Kerry could do it. Oh, there's Barack Obama. It doesn't qualify to recognize and that's star power

[02:33:58.300 --> 02:34:04.660]
That said he's got the star power right now. He's the man who appeals to young people and political newcomers

[02:34:04.660 --> 02:34:09.420]
I kept staying over and over again that you know we're I'm hoping we're not sure yet

[02:34:09.420 --> 02:34:15.640]
You know hoping that have a rock son around but for me like he's the one that sort of embodies that spirit of Bobby Kennedy of

[02:34:15.640 --> 02:34:22.660]
Hope there you go. He's like darker, complex, but Bobby Kennedy this Hollywood crowd to his fundraiser never got a shot at Merlin Monroe

[02:34:22.660 --> 02:34:25.300]
Damn, and I bet he's not too happy about that, but that's where it goes

[02:34:26.500 --> 02:34:31.900]
1192 I bet if I refresh did before we do the break we could have the 12 easy and then just all take a

[02:34:31.900 --> 02:34:38.480]
Ah big sigh relief like that. Wow. I'm refreshing right now. Are you refreshing it? Oh, I'm just no

[02:34:38.480 --> 02:34:44.060]
Like the crow as a matter of fact like that cashmere bouquet. He was just smell like he bathed him. I know I've said that many times

[02:34:44.820 --> 02:34:45.620]
1197 oh

[02:34:46.800 --> 02:34:47.560]
Uh-oh

[02:34:48.760 --> 02:34:50.940]
Right on the edge of the 29

[02:34:51.940 --> 02:34:56.760]
Wow one more vote whoever votes next will be our 1200 vote and Georgia will send you a trillion dollars

[02:34:56.760 --> 02:34:58.520]
No, won't even send you a penny

[02:34:58.960 --> 02:34:59.940]
Maybe I'll send you a penny

[02:35:01.140 --> 02:35:09.340]
How about pennies from rumor? How's that sound? Okay 20 pasted. What's 20 before it's 139 is what it is. It's almost to a clock. Thank God

[02:35:17.760 --> 02:35:22.500]
Are you a former astronaut in feeling depressed irritable, irrational, and vengeful?

[02:35:22.960 --> 02:35:27.120]
Are you having difficulty adjusting from the highs of orbit to the lows of everyday life?

[02:35:27.120 --> 02:35:30.440]
Then you may be suffering from PISCD

[02:35:30.440 --> 02:35:32.980]
Post-Initial Space Shuttle Event Disorder

[02:35:33.520 --> 02:35:42.200]
The warning signs of PISCD include wearing disguises rubber hose and plastic bag collecting a sudden fondness for knives and pepper spray

[02:35:42.200 --> 02:35:46.320]
And the desire to take long car rides simmering in your own expatory fluids

[02:35:46.320 --> 02:35:50.260]
If you suffer from any or all of these symptoms, you're not alone

[02:35:50.260 --> 02:35:54.400]
Literally ones of former astronauts suffer from PISCD

[02:35:54.400 --> 02:35:56.680]
Post-Initial Space Shuttle Event Disorder

[02:35:56.680 --> 02:35:59.120]
But there it is. Going on, I think you had a very good point

[02:35:59.120 --> 02:36:03.460]
That is that these relentless people who are arrogant stubborn as hell

[02:36:03.460 --> 02:36:08.320]
They they have the answers man. They know what I no matter what you say to them about their sports obsession

[02:36:08.320 --> 02:36:11.880]
It's never going to sink through because that's all they know about like clearance for example

[02:36:12.380 --> 02:36:17.340]
I still can't get over that story you told a couple days ago on Monday that that just mind-boggling

[02:36:17.340 --> 02:36:22.480]
That he is giving you suggestions what you should or should not talk about on the air

[02:36:22.480 --> 02:36:25.800]
After a few more sessions I should be number one maybe even legendary

[02:36:28.440 --> 02:36:35.660]
Our legendary jackass program director who wouldn't know a real talk show from his from his nut nipple if he had one

[02:36:36.500 --> 02:36:36.980]
God

[02:36:38.120 --> 02:36:43.920]
And he's giving you advice on what to talk about and don't talk about religion because it's your offense a lot of people

[02:36:43.920 --> 02:36:48.400]
No have Iroh win bag on again to talk about that crap again

[02:36:50.900 --> 02:36:54.740]
Have what's his name on drew Rosenhouse because everybody really likes him not

[02:36:56.580 --> 02:37:01.020]
See me one thing if he was really interesting and he had something to say and but not only see not interesting

[02:37:01.020 --> 02:37:04.880]
And has nothing to say but the public despises him like poison am I right Chris?

[02:37:06.160 --> 02:37:09.360]
Oh, yeah, Drew Rosenstein House shorts whatever's name it

[02:37:10.180 --> 02:37:15.900]
Follow for on a poll now that not even George's got a man who's not not too big with the compliments not too easy

[02:37:15.900 --> 02:37:22.460]
Handed out all the praise he's got to admit there was a major accomplishment even on day when he hated the pool like poison hated it

[02:37:24.200 --> 02:37:26.260]
Jeremy level rights on the BBC

[02:37:26.980 --> 02:37:30.480]
US Iran attack plans revealed see I save this for the Averyan

[02:37:31.880 --> 02:37:38.540]
US contingency plans for air strikes on Iran extend beyond nuclear sites and include most of the countries military infrastructure the BBC has learned

[02:37:39.400 --> 02:37:43.220]
It is understood that any such attack afforded would target Iranian air bases

[02:37:43.220 --> 02:37:46.680]
Naval bases missile facilities and command and control centers

[02:37:47.300 --> 02:37:50.900]
The US insists it's not planning to attack and is trying to persuade to Iran to start

[02:37:50.900 --> 02:37:56.880]
Says the trigger for such an attack reportedly includes any confirmation that Iran was developing a nuclear weapon which it denies

[02:37:57.860 --> 02:38:02.060]
Alternatively our correspondent adds a high casualty attack on US forces in neighboring Iraq

[02:38:02.060 --> 02:38:06.660]
Could also trigger a bombing campaign if it were traced directly back to Tehran well. They could just may fit up

[02:38:07.520 --> 02:38:13.120]
Long range beat to stealth bombers would drop so called bunker busting bombs in an effort to penetrate the Natan

[02:38:13.220 --> 02:38:15.860]
Which is very some 27 yards underground

[02:38:17.080 --> 02:38:23.960]
The BBC's Tehran correspondent Francis Harrison says the news that there are now two possible triggers for an attack is of concern to Iranians

[02:38:24.540 --> 02:38:28.440]
Authorities insist there's no cost for alarm but ordinary people are not becoming a little bit worried

[02:38:28.440 --> 02:38:35.360]
Earlier this multi-west officers in Iraq said they had evidence that Iran was providing weapons to Iraqi Shia militias

[02:38:35.360 --> 02:38:38.940]
However, the most senior US military officer later cast doubt on these claims

[02:38:38.940 --> 02:38:42.560]
Saying they only had proof that weapons made in Iran were being used in Iraq

[02:38:43.480 --> 02:38:44.840]
General Peter Pace

[02:38:44.840 --> 02:38:49.620]
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said he didn't know that the Iranian government clearly knows there is complicit in this

[02:38:49.620 --> 02:38:54.780]
At the time Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmedinajad I just love saying that

[02:38:54.780 --> 02:38:59.680]
Mahmoud Ahmedinajad said the accusations were excuses to prolong the state of US forces in Iraq

[02:39:01.240 --> 02:39:06.860]
Middle East analysts have recently voiced their fears of catastrophic consequences for any such US attack on Iran

[02:39:07.720 --> 02:39:10.820]
Catastrophic consequences did you hear those words? I heard it

[02:39:10.820 --> 02:39:19.220]
Britain's previous ambassador to Tehran Sir Richard Dalenthal to BBC would backfire badly by probably encouraging the Iranian government to develop a nuclear weapon in the long term

[02:39:20.300 --> 02:39:27.080]
Last year Iran resumed the Iranian enrichment a process that can make fuel for power stations or if greatly enriched material for a nuclear bomb

[02:39:27.080 --> 02:39:32.480]
Tehran insist its program is for civil use only the Western countries suspect Iran is trying to build nuclear weapons

[02:39:33.060 --> 02:39:37.580]
The UN Security Council is called on Iran to suspend its enrichment of Iranian by February 21

[02:39:37.580 --> 02:39:41.400]
That's today by the way if you look at that calendar if you look at the Getsky calendar

[02:39:41.980 --> 02:39:45.720]
If it does not and the international what does that mean? I don't even get it

[02:39:45.720 --> 02:39:50.120]
I think I think everybody's doing magic mushrooms because he wrote me an incoherent email just now

[02:39:50.120 --> 02:39:52.920]
I can't even make heads or tails of it. Hey, it's nice to share

[02:39:53.720 --> 02:39:56.720]
Sure what all the magic mushrooms sure. We write over for you

[02:39:56.780 --> 02:39:57.360]

[02:40:20.780 --> 02:40:25.920]
I've been a great show. I just wanted to say you know I was accepted for the poll and

[02:40:25.920 --> 02:40:29.260]
I'm looking forward to that next poll that the caller just called in with

[02:40:32.040 --> 02:40:33.060]
Yeah up and nevertheless

[02:40:34.180 --> 02:40:38.360]

Well, he sounds like a good guy, but he just had nothing so maybe it's trying he's trying to be helpful

[02:40:41.880 --> 02:40:43.940]
You know there's nothing wrong. We're trying to be helpful. No

[02:40:46.060 --> 02:40:46.380]
You

[02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:51.940]
Oh and you kissed their ass earlier, but now you have to kiss there. I don't understand what he's talking

[02:40:52.520 --> 02:40:56.420]
I'm sure he doesn't either. I'm trying to read an inquiry here at messenger, you know, oh, I sure don't

[02:40:56.420 --> 02:40:58.280]
I don't want to take it the wrong way

[02:41:01.500 --> 02:41:01.860]
Oh

[02:41:17.180 --> 02:41:17.340]
So

[02:41:20.280 --> 02:41:35.580]
Good lady games

[02:41:46.900 --> 02:41:52.420]
Now you've got to hide your heart away.

[02:41:54.580 --> 02:42:00.500]
Now you've got to hide your heart away.

[02:42:02.480 --> 02:42:08.320]
I will sharpen hardly past this at-straight,

[02:42:08.680 --> 02:42:09.600]
Gain or buy,

[02:42:10.580 --> 02:42:14.320]
Man, you're a fool of other men.

[02:42:14.700 --> 02:42:17.500]
Is a sword for a state of mind,

[02:42:18.020 --> 02:42:19.420]
Young, young,

[02:42:20.280 --> 02:42:24.460]
No, no, fear, just sword for a queers,

[02:42:24.720 --> 02:42:27.300]
Having fun with the boys.

[02:42:28.360 --> 02:42:31.700]
In the locked room, I hear,

[02:42:32.300 --> 02:42:37.160]
Boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy.
