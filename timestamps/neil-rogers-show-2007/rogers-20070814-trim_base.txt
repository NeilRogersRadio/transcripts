[00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.920]
Got to get around a wheel of fortune game

[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.040]

[00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.220]
Don't care how much money I got to spend

[00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.280]

Still like by your powers, O Vanna, pick me a letter

[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.600]
Hey man, what do you mean there's no heaven for?

[00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.380]
Vanna picked me a letter

[00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.640]
No one does it any better, I dream about you

[00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.680]
Hey Vanna, is that an all over tan or what?

[00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.160]
Vanna, I don't understand why you make a hundred grand

[00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.940]
Not for me to say, oh!

[00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.700]
Anyway, get me a ticket for an airplane

[00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.280]

[00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.960]

[00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.560]
Hey get out of my face, fast, get out of my way

[00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:08.640]
Hey, is there no end at word?

[00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.740]
Is the low rider?

[00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.980]
Oh, I love my eyes

[00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.400]
Forget the letter, man, I'll take Vanna away

[00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.300]
You're beautiful, baby

[00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.800]
You and me could play the home game

[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.740]
Got me a ticket for an airplane

[00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.520]
Alright, I'm under, we love fortune-game

[00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.160]
I just love that sound, I'm in the bonus round

[00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.500]
Hey Vanna, pick me a letter

[00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.140]
Close a turn, hey fast, lose it

[00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.840]
Vanna picked me a letter

[00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.080]
No one does it any better, I dream about you

[00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.080]
Alright, that is an all over tan

[00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.360]
Vanna, I don't mean to stare, but are you wearing underwear?

[00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.260]
Not for me to say, anyway!

[00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.440]
I don't care how much money I got to spend

[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.020]
Can't stand to look, get back to the jack again

[00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.660]
Who's throwing the towel, till I buy your bowels

[00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.700]
Oh Vanna, pick me a letter

[00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.040]
Please Vanna, pick me a letter

[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.800]
Alright, I'm ready to pick, baby

[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.560]
NPCD, EMG, HG, TK, LNOP, P2R, CW, X, Y, D

[00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.920]
That's your clever man

[00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:12.400]
Alright, I'll take the sofa, the blender, the microwave, the refrigerator

[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.240]
Hey, man, what do you mean?

[00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.140]
500 dollars for a black and white five in portable TV set

[00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:18.600]
You got ripped off, man

[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.040]
My brother and one can get it for your old sales

[00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.760]
Give me the money and I'll buy the CW set, man, alright?

[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.260]
I got it for mom and me

[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.720]
1003 at 560 W3 on the reason I played that

[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.120]
Obviously because we're mourning the passing

[00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.220]
Let me say it again for the 8 billion times

[00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.420]
Just in case you missed it the first 7 billion times

[00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.800]
The media is sick and you're so bad

[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.300]
Oh my god, somebody that we once knew who it was died

[00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:50.980]
And right away we have to eulogize

[00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.280]
We have to make a big sentence about it

[00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.620]
Where Griffin is dead, to which I say

[00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:57.080]
Oh right

[00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.380]
Whatever, I say whatever

[00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.400]
Yeah, she's dead, where Griffin is

[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.020]
Okay, oh, don't say that

[00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.060]
Not after somebody dies, you know, you doesn't say that

[00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.820]
And Larry's under eulogizing and emoting

[00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.140]
And we got Jerry Seinfeld on

[00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.760]
And we got your buddy, Alex Trabik on there, the geek in the van and all these other

[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.360]
Oh my god, you were the thought that this guy had some talent

[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.140]
Merb

[00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.300]
That's a money, so

[00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.540]
He had tons of money and the main reason he had tons of money

[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.700]
Was because of Jeopardy and Wheel of Fortune

[00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.900]
I'll give him that, he invented both of those shows

[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:29.300]
I'll give him that

[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:30.760]
Would you give him that?

[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.540]
Well, yeah, I'll give it to him, here you go

[00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.620]
So you're sitting on the floor because the beast broke the chair?

[00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.460]
Yeah, yeah, that's what happened

[00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:38.880]
We have a series of bad chair events

[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.500]
W-I-O-D and W-Q-A-M over the years we've had some bad chair events

[00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:44.620]
First was the goddess

[00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.600]
She assorled, she stained the chair at the I-O-D

[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.840]
She spoiled it, the chair

[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.200]
She spoiled it and she soiled it and she ruined it and she approved it

[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.620]
She's a silly, silly person

[00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.120]
Anyway, that chair was a history

[00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.840]
And then we came to Q-A-M and Po-W had a series of really bad people destroying chairs

[00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.720]
Josh, we've got to one chair

[00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.180]
He wasn't so much that he broke them as he stank them out

[00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.840]
Mmm, he's, Randy skanked them out and he stanked them out

[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:14.180]
Wasn't good

[00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.820]
And now of course the most recent, the beast filling

[00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.020]
And I get to call, not a call, but I have like a text message

[00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:23.460]
730 Friday morning, I think buzzes

[00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.120]
My blackberry buzzes and I look over it

[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.220]
Oh, George pulled his hamstring or Torres hamstring he has today is skating

[00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.300]
See, this is what happens when guys like you try to like to be

[00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.900]
Try, I don't make funny when you fell walking down the street

[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.520]
Mr. World Traveler

[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:39.060]
Yeah

[00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.380]
I wasn't doing anything weird or fancy

[00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.980]
I was saying Stone Street, man, I'll tell you when you go to Amsterdam

[00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:45.120]
What do you know about roller skating?

[00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:46.600]
I'll show you the spot right there, buddy

[00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.780]
Trust me, you take a bigger risk walking to the bathroom than I do roller skating

[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.540]
I never fell in tour my hamstring going to the bathroom, right?

[00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.280]
No, although being the clutch that I have to walk

[00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.260]
So walking down the street you shouldn't be doing that

[00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:59.960]
I shouldn't be doing what?

[00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.900]
Walking down the street you should just stay immobile and bad forever

[00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:03.460]
I see

[00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.840]
So anyway, the latest chair episode is that the beast did come in on Friday

[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:12.140]
and a butcher up the show although now Chris can tell me were you working on Friday?

[00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:13.360]
Yeah, of course

[00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.400]
We didn't have any sports writers on the show, did we?

[00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:18.300]
Oh, of course not

[00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.360]
Oh, like I said, great job beast

[00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.920]
And when people did try to call to ask them about sports questions they hung up on them

[00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:25.540]
Did he really?

[00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:26.400]
Yep

[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.680]
There were people crawling in with sports questions

[00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:32.540]
Now you know how it is, you hear the beast's voice and you assume it's a sports show

[00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:34.100]
Why?

[00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:36.260]
There's no sense to me

[00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.820]
You assume 10 to 2 on the station is a sports show

[00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:43.420]
And by the way Ethan Scoric, thank you so much for that brilliant column you wrote in your blog

[00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:46.600]
on a Sunscentle haircut in my pile here somewhere

[00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:50.320]
Many days ago, in which he didn't really say anything

[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:53.700]
Oh well there's all kinds of changes in the lineups at the two sports stations

[00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:55.800]
Oh, and I'm always on one of them

[00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.260]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:02.680]
Seriously, the thing with the sports writers this is the most evil thing in the history of this business

[00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.320]
that has ever been forced that I think one

[00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:09.040]
And the fact that the management, as such as they are sitting back and allowing this to go on

[00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:11.560]
as the numbers continue taking a tumble

[00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.720]
I don't understand it, I don't get it

[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:16.460]
What is it?

[00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:20.480]
Ethan Scoric, what kind of naked pictures does he have?

[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.520]
Alex Marvez, he must have like triple copies of all those naked pictures

[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:31.080]
Every time you turn around here are the newspaper Mafia have taken over at QAM

[00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.860]
And I was really amused by all the, and guess who wrote the last column?

[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:40.120]
The last comment to the blog that Ethan Scoric wrote about the lineups of the two sports stations?

[00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:41.780]
Guess who wrote the last column?

[00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:44.400]
I'll give you a triple clues George, Ethan Scoric

[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.520]
No, no, the last comment, Josh Darrow

[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:49.920]
Bald, New York, Don Eimes,

[00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:55.500]
Sid the Kid, yeah, Sid the Kid, he feels compelled to write a comment

[00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:01.720]
He's so, of course most of the comments ripping him an ass like go back to New York and we hope you die

[00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:06.260]
and you're obnoxious and even the worst New Yorkers can't stand you, stuff like that you know

[00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:12.380]
I mean there was nothing positive of my mere issue but then it was all sports nerds writing in

[00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:13.140]
So what do I care?

[00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:17.680]
Plus all that stuff on the internet, all those blogs and all those comments posted

[00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:20.560]
It's all crap, we already went through that experience

[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.380]
Why does anybody want to do that?

[00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:26.760]
Why does anybody want to subject itself to that?

[00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:31.420]
Probably for the same reason that we put all these sports nerds on here, these sports writers

[00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:38.840]
It's like an epidemic, it's like the bubonic plague of the Sun, Central and the Herald have invaded the QAM

[00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:43.860]
And these people, instead of trying to cure the disease, they keep making it worse

[00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:51.660]
AirV show, except this one, AirV show is invaded and fested by these people

[00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:57.480]
And if they were broadcasted, they'd have shows, they'd be on the air, they'd have their own show

[00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:02.680]
Ethan's school, it sounds like Gildey on Helium for Christ's sake, Jesus God

[00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:06.180]
Anyway, don't let me get too upset about that

[00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:07.720]
Okay, don't

[00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:12.340]
Now that Merv Griffin is dead, oh what was us, what are we gonna do, Merv Griffin died, she's dead

[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:18.000]
Hundreds of antivirus activists gathered near Dick Cheney's home at an exclusive Wyoming country club to protest

[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.700]
The Vice President's role in leading the US into Iraq

[00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:24.700]
Chanting no more Iraq war and impeach Cheney first

[00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:30.820]
Protesters gathered outside the Titan Pines country club where Cheney typically spends the month long August recess

[00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:37.960]
They brought long and ten-foot tall paper mache sculpture that featured Cheney holding a fishing pole in one hand and an oil well in the other

[00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:45.440]
In a video posted on you, CUBE, a protester climbs the FG and places a new surround its neck

[00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:48.120]
Oh, I like it

[00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:53.920]
Protesters, oh, and he was also on their last night, Ed McMahon, kissing Merv's dead ass

[00:08:55.080 --> 00:09:02.640]
Protester's then pulled on the Cheney like this in a scene reminiscent of Iraqis and US troops toppling the statue of Sodom and after the fall of Baghdad and that photo op for CNN

[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:11.220]
We organized it because of the war in Iraq and what an injustice it's been while farmerry we tried to force kept them registered Republican told the Casper star Tribune

[00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:14.120]
The Vice President has received a pass in Jackson long enough

[00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:18.780]
We want to let them know we don't approve of the war or how they play fast and loose with the Constitution

[00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:20.960]
They're playing with it, fast and loose

[00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:29.660]
Protester's carried signs that said, both Cheney were propeteers, feel safe yet, violence breeds violence and at least the war on the middle class is going well

[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:37.040]
One of the protester Cindy Knight said she's got a son in the military and came to voice this pleasure with the administration's war policy

[00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:41.500]
Knight said in the Serpent of Afghanistan, I don't want him to lose his life in the Iraq war she told the Tribune

[00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:45.280]
I don't want him to come back in a body and a sack, my son and a sack

[00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:50.520]
So how do you like that? And Carl Rob, he's, you know, he stepped aside

[00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:55.320]
That's a crap going on, why would anybody want to hear about that? Well, we got, give me the ball, give me the ball

[00:09:55.320 --> 00:10:01.680]
We got the dolphins baby who pulled out a last minute win against Jacksonville and they pathetic showing on Saturday

[00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:08.180]
Now, were you there, Chris? No, why not?

[00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:12.060]
Because... I thought you were a big fan

[00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:17.720]
Oh I am, but I wanted to say nothing game, exhibition game

[00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:22.180]
Exactly, Frank Green against played like a 90 year old, old Getsky

[00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:29.620]
Yeah, exactly, I was supposed to actually work the pregame, but they couldn't get another press pass, so they said sorry we don't need you

[00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:34.700]
They couldn't get another press pass that it ever done in you that they lied to you and that because of the fact that you work on this show

[00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:38.400]
They were going to stick it to you right in the old shoot, don't you get the message?

[00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:45.260]
Well, they came to me asking me if I could work the pregame, and I was like I know it's your only day off, it's Saturday and Avable, could you do it, work your hand?

[00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:49.900]
I'm like okay fine, whatever, and then the Friday before the game they're like oh you don't have to go

[00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:54.300]
Did you talk about it? If they put any more of these sports writers on here you're going to start killing some people in that building

[00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:56.420]
Did you tell them that because you got my permission to do it?

[00:10:57.460 --> 00:11:01.180]
It's the pull from yesterday, it's not a rhetorical question, you don't have to answer them

[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:02.140]
You're going to go to the top?

[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:06.180]
534 measly votes yesterday, George, that's pretty weak, although they...

[00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:07.600]
Yeah, what?

[00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:10.960]
It was on there for six hours, what do you think it was saying that like it?

[00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:13.100]
I know, so it's been on there for a long time.

[00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:17.640]
In your own personal experience which of these is the most addictive, George asked, 534 votes.

[00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:27.300]
Siga wets 89, booze 76, sex 75, pornography 56, sugar 44, that's what I voted, I mean it's no contest.

[00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:30.260]
Coffee 42, the Nearages show 35.

[00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:37.500]
Crack cocaine 22, video games 22, powdered cocaine 21, take a powder, take a BC powder.

[00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:39.920]
If you're a redneck from the South, take a BC powder.

[00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:43.960]
Maybe that's how those people got to be like they are, too much BC powder.

[00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:44.580]
All I'm redneck?

[00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:47.020]
49, pot 9, heroin 9.

[00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:49.500]
Looks to me like the popular vote was...

[00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:49.680]
Yeah!

[00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:57.360]
A myth 7, watching sports 5, playing sports 4, my Blackberry 4, chat rooms 3, and adrenaline,

[00:11:57.940 --> 00:11:59.880]
thrill seeking, solomente dose.

[00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:02.980]
Tril seeking, that's what we're doing here on QA.

[00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:03.900]
Tril seeking the truth.

[00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:05.600]
Take a look at this, I beg your pardon?

[00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:06.440]
Is that what we're doing?

[00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:08.560]
What we were when we came here 9.5 years ago.

[00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:11.020]
You know who I am? I'm Moe Green.

[00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:14.040]
I made my bones when you were going out with cheerleaders.

[00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:18.320]

你rs państwa席你們在場的牛場打算謹sed up.

[00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:42.220]
你比隊長稍微輪廚一樣,

[00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:43.260]
let's go look at that schedule.

[00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:46.740]
That looks like it.

[00:13:51.500 --> 00:14:01.200]
Coroner Jed you think the dog would like him to say yes.

[00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:05.820]
But he's not I don't think it's usually local sports writers. Oh, thanks God.

[00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:12.940]
I like the out of town sports writers, but not local. This can't be right. Isn't today Tuesday, August 14. Yeah.

[00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:13.660]
Yours.

[00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:20.760]
Well, I see that's why both camp was known this morning. I guess power hour with mad dog and both camp are between four and five.

[00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:22.800]
Who's going to talk about toilet seats?

[00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:29.820]
Bow and Orlando with dolphin camp between five and six thirty. So I'm assuming the humpers on vacation is weak. Is that correct? No, Humber.

[00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:31.100]
Sure. Oh, Humber this week.

[00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:38.580]
Marlins on deck at six thirty. The Marlins. Oh my God. It's the middle of August. They're still playing. I can't believe it.

[00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:46.200]
Six thirty. It's the pregame show the Marlins and Arizona at seven oh five tonight. The right, the hunchbacks and then overnight with that

[00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:52.440]
he came up to the baseball game. How can we have baseball still on when we got the preseason that the exhibitionist games going on?

[00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:56.180]
It cares about baseball anymore. Am I right?

[00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:05.160]
Look, here's the fool for today. How many votes we got? We're going to make a thousand a day. Chris, what do you say? We got six eighty three. We got almost seven hundred, baby. Yeah, we'll do it.

[00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:11.140]
Baby as Nick Fightow would say, baby. He's another one needs to be taken out for a long walk.

[00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:18.040]
Who's your favorite Jewish comedian of all time? This is another one of Charlie B's pulling. By the way, Charlie B, I don't care if

[00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:25.580]
Merv Griffin's theme song is on his website. I don't give a crap about Merv Griffin. He was a closet queen, no talent piece of

[00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:32.620]
third who made millions and the Zidians and billions of dollars and he made me sick. Did you like him? No.

[00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:41.200]
Hey, did him. Rodney Dangerfield is kicking ass, baby. Your favorite Jewish comedian of all time, 131. There's only a thousand names on the

[00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:46.740]
pool. So by the time we get to the Dunneur, mad dogs stand by because by the time I get through reading the pool, it'll be two o'clock.

[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:54.220]
Should I read them all? I'll read them all a few times. Yeah, I do. A hundred times. Well, why not? What's the point of taking a pool if you're not going to read all the names?

[00:15:54.460 --> 00:16:02.000]
Right. Mel Brooks, 87 Jerry Seinfeld is third with 46. That makes me want to vomit. He makes me want to vomit.

[00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:07.520]
In fact, compared to Jerry Seinfeld, I loved Merv Griffin. I miss him already.

[00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:15.700]
Groucho Marx, 41. Now, what does it say of the Marx brothers and parentheses? Then I had to be a, you know, for the people of

[00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:22.600]
the world. What's wrong with you, Charlie Beard? You're some kind of a moron or what? I mean, I can understand Gummo and Chico and Harpo and Zepo.

[00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:32.080]
But like Groucho needs to have the Marx brothers next to his name. Come on, Charlie. Be your slip in a year old age. I think you're falling into that whole sports nerd mentality.

[00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:38.680]
Because you notice even some of his polls. He's got a pool. He sent us to win. Did that come in yesterday or whenever?

[00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:47.300]
About how many games have I been going to win this today? I'll say how many games did Alphan's are going to win more than? Oh, and less than five.

[00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:55.300]
Okay. Groucho's got 41. Curly Howard of the three stuages, 35. We'll get to his buddies later. His brothers.

[00:16:56.180 --> 00:17:00.400]
Don Rickles, 33. How come he's only got 33?

[00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:09.180]
John's story 32. See, that's another thing. We can get the young talks back if I pretend that John's story is very funny and that the daily show is really great.

[00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:30.380]
But I can't do that because it would be a big lie. I'm sure maybe once in a while, you know, maybe we got something good. I just never saw any of those shows. Woody Allen 22, Andrew Dice Clay 20. Jack Benny 20. Jackie Mason 19. I'm not going to play it. Adam Sandler 15. That means I'm going to play it.

[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:40.860]
That makes me again one of Pufets. And that's a demographic thing. Billy Crystal 15. Larry David 14. Who the hell's Larry David? Is he Kim DeMo Howard David? Yes.

[00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:44.880]
He's the co-creator of Seinfeld.

[00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:57.400]
Is he still alive? Yeah. He's got a third. Oh, damn it. George Burns 13. Let me Bruce 13. But he hacked at 12. Jerry Lewis 9. Milton Burle 9.

[00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:00.760]
He'll the redener eight. Well, I love her. She was so great. Mm-hmm.

[00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:08.500]
Mo Howard David has got seven. I voted for him. I gave him my vote, Mo. Just for old times sake.

[00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:20.020]
Hennie Youngman 6. He's still parking with that violin. He's never going to play it. Jerry stiller 6. Jill Agilbert Gumpfried 6. Ben Stiller 5. Also 2 Jewish for me.

[00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:29.960]
Sarah Silverman 5. Roseanne Bar 5. Al Franken 5. Pauli Sure 4. Shimp Howard of the three stuages 4. Shimp. Shimp.

[00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:39.480]
John Rivers 3. Harpo Marks 3. Tom Lehrer 3. I never knew till till his pull. Kim and I never knew he was Jewish.

[00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:48.120]
Since these are three Victor Borgo 3. Sandra Bernhard 3. Carl Reiner 2. We never did put Rob Reiner on there. Why not? Put him on there, please.

[00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:53.260]
Chris didn't like him. Now, sir, sir, are you anti-Semitic or what? Put Rob Reiner on there. No, no.

[00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:59.660]
More people are going to know him from all in the family than they're going to know Carl Reiner who was on the Steve Allen show 600 years ago.

[00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:10.900]
What the hell's wrong with you, man? Carl Reiner 2. Ben Middler 2. You're like all fat people like me. You're lazy. Like me. I resent having to work today. Robert Klein 2. Al Jolson 2.

[00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:17.980]
Mamie Larry Fine of the three stuages 2. You know what his favorite line was? Oh, we're fine.

[00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:30.940]
Albert Brooks 2. Fanny Bryce 2. Rita Rudner 1. Gummel has 1. Chico 1. See, I call him Chico, but Groucho, you always call him Chico.

[00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:38.240]
Didn't we go through that once before you? I don't know. Richard Lewis 1. Oscar Levant 1. Hey, Oscar. You're fairy.

[00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:53.400]
Alan King 1. He's dead. Danny K1. George Jessel 1. Shakey Green has 1. Shelley Berman 1. And where he ends to M1. No votes for the following. And this really pisses me off. Edwin doesn't have any votes. Edwin was great.

[00:19:55.200 --> 00:20:04.480]
Andy Sandberg, I have no idea who that is. Paul Rodriguez. Who? Saturday Night Live. Oh, the new one. Yeah. I don't want you. And Mira.

[00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:21.700]
Zepo Marks Charles Groden. Oh, he's Jewish. I'm going to kill myself. Eddie Cantor and Red Buttons have none. Out of 703. We have over 700 votes. I think we're going to do 1000 today. If we could do 1000 on the 14th day of Groucho, El Catorce de Agosto.

[00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:31.460]
It would be big news, wouldn't it? Okay. It would be almost as big news as a vote camper was down this morning to talk about Ethan Skolnik's ball habits.

[00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:50.140]
Ethan Skolnik from the Sun Sentinel. I'm a radio star now. Well, what are we going to do about this? I think there needs to be a war. There needs to be a revolution between the pro sports writer, Krawe, which is clearance. I can't imagine anybody else in that building really believes that we need to put these people on here. And all the rest of us, we need to kill him.

[00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:54.540]
What? What do you want to know about?

[00:20:54.540 --> 00:21:06.160]
The dream. Now, who was the first one that I said that you had to kill? I said before that was your job. Beast. No, not the beast. Now, you tell me. So tell us your one on Friday. Did you talk about this yesterday?

[00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:23.060]
I guess a little. Well, I want to hear from Chris. How the sure one. He was there. He was producing it. It went. I mean, we had callers. Don't say it went. Don't don't look. Don't beat around. Don't mention words. I want to hear if it was okay or if it was a piece of garbage.

[00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:36.720]
It was okay. See, there was more hours on a Friday. How's that? Yeah. Great. That's all I wanted it to be.

[00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:53.420]
We didn't make, there was no radio magic made. We saw it. Yeah. In other words, it was a piece of crap. Is that what you're trying to say? Why don't you just come right out, open up a mouth and say something.

[00:21:56.180 --> 00:22:03.760]
Because I thought there was or wasn't. I mean, it was. Were you embarrassed? Were you were you humiliated and disgrace to be associated with it? Yes. Well, that tells me.

[00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:15.460]
Sports sports sports sports sports sports sports sports sports sports sports sports sports sports sports sports sports sports sports sports. I like reading the sports section. I like reading the sports section too.

[00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:22.840]
The paper is better news in a computer. You can read the paper on the toilet. I don't like computers because what's it got to do with sports?

[00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:34.600]
Sports sports sports sports sports sports sports sports sports sports sports sports sports sports sports sports sports sports. We got a girl in here. Yeah. A girl.

[00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:45.440]
See? We're straight. That's a girl. Girls are okay, but I'd rather stare blankly ahead and just talk about sports sports sports sports sports sports sports sports sports sports sports sports sports sports sports sports sports sports sports sports sports sports sports sports sports sports sports sports sports sports sports. We got a girl in here. Yeah. A girl. Hello. See? We're straight. That's a girl.

[00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:18.520]
2006 Japanese women set a new record for life expectancy at eighty five point

[00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:22.700]
eight one years while men live an average of about 79 years I'm moving to

[00:39:22.700 --> 00:39:27.060]
Japan too late the number of Japanese living beyond a hundred is almost

[00:39:27.060 --> 00:39:31.380]
quadruple in the past ten years and as soon as expected as surpassed 28,000

[00:39:31.380 --> 00:39:35.020]
the government announced last September so if you want to be a hundred move to

[00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:40.360]
Japan it's not because of where you live it's too late for that you got to

[00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:44.520]
live your whole life eating that diet right and breathing in that fresh air you

[00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:50.480]
know all the fallout from Hiroshima and that stuff now what you I don't know

[00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:55.720]
we you think the air is really breathable in Japan sure that was a long time ago

[00:39:58.120 --> 00:40:02.420]
yeah fifty five let's see if you don't go there and lick the ground you know

[00:40:02.420 --> 00:40:07.520]
that's all but for any radiation would still go there and get your licks and the

[00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:11.500]
Japanese by the way are very uptight about that whole you know about the sex the

[00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:16.440]
sex trade in Japan if you're like a tourist I was reading about that if you're

[00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:19.240]
a tourist they won't even take it at places where all the hanky spanky is going

[00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:22.600]
to because they want to make you think that they don't care about sex maybe if

[00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:26.580]
you know the language that's not what I heard do you know the language no I

[00:40:26.580 --> 00:40:30.220]
don't but I know people that do my daughter spend a year there said everything's

[00:40:30.220 --> 00:40:33.860]
right out in the open depending on where you go that they don't I should have

[00:40:33.860 --> 00:40:38.000]
was exposed any Japanese hanky spanky that would be bad she knows all about it

[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:40.440]
knows how to take care of herself especially when she's a whole head taller than

[00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:45.040]
the tallest guy oh yeah where the Japanese like midgets like the Chinese

[00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:48.420]
sex on as much as they used to be since they've you know gotten around to the

[00:40:49.160 --> 00:40:53.120]
improved diet but nothing was maybe since all radio activity is

[00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:56.600]
dissipated from Hiroshima and Nagasaki maybe the reason of getting born with like

[00:40:56.600 --> 00:41:00.540]
six eyes in the corner of their head and stuff like that that'll teach him

[00:41:02.060 --> 00:41:05.340]

pregnating all these broads seven hundred and seventy eight votes on that

[00:48:05.580 --> 00:48:09.800]
pool already we're gonna make a thousand of the easy Chris stuff good

[00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:15.560]
to me that's my fearless prediction and if we get a thousand votes don't forget no more sports

[00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:19.100]

ought to be running around over right with your own uh thing Georgia's got a torn

[00:48:33.220 --> 00:48:37.720]
thing not the first time who's your favorite Jewish

[00:48:37.720 --> 00:48:40.740]
community of all time is our pool today and of course so we probably should have

[00:48:40.740 --> 00:48:43.640]
put a thing about there I hate should we put a thing in one of them it's not

[00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:46.800]
I hate this pool we don't do that anymore but how about I hate the Jews

[00:48:49.100 --> 00:48:52.160]
what God wouldn't have touched that might why would you give those people

[00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:54.960]
something to vote for why not there's a whole bunch of

[00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:57.520]
months there look at there's nothing wrong with honesty okay

[00:48:59.420 --> 00:49:03.240]
uh what you don't think we have to run around I had to shift in

[00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:05.320]
it there's nothing wrong with honesty okay

[00:49:06.860 --> 00:49:10.880]
what you don't think we have to run around I had to shift in

[00:49:10.880 --> 00:49:12.620]
her you had to what shift

[00:49:15.580 --> 00:49:20.600]
my position did you hear what he said Chris he said shift

[00:49:23.120 --> 00:49:24.980]
how do you spell that

[00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:32.340]
that's eight eight hi seven hundred and anyone votes on a pool if we can make

[00:49:32.340 --> 00:49:36.420]
a thousand by two o'clock no more sports writers on Q&A until

[00:49:36.420 --> 00:49:41.040]
until of the year 25 25 when all the current ones are long since did

[00:49:43.580 --> 00:49:47.200]
and you think I'm and you'll notice that the more I talk about it the more he puts

[00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:51.900]
them on there right like I told like I told fat ass Jolly Joe Bell whatever I say

[00:49:51.900 --> 00:49:56.620]
you'll do exactly the opposite you know about right right whatever I say they'll

[00:49:56.620 --> 00:50:00.020]
do the opposite if I if I say we ought to have a sports writer on every even on

[00:50:00.020 --> 00:50:03.260]
this show they'd say oh that's a bad idea and nobody wants to hear what those

[00:50:03.260 --> 00:50:07.140]
bozos have to say those a holes which would be of course the correct answer

[00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:12.000]
if anybody's interested in freaking Ethan Skolik read his crap in a sun

Skolik on it was like a 10-year-old kid with bad BMs

[00:50:28.960 --> 00:50:33.760]
781 on the pool and it's no contest that's the sad part we could probably get

[00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:37.020]
like 50,000 votes if we had like a real you know what I mean if there was like a

[00:50:37.020 --> 00:50:44.320]
goal involved there a real race a house race Rodney Dangerfield 152 he's

[00:50:44.320 --> 00:50:48.300]
way out in front nobody's touching Rodney and when you come right down to it who'd

[00:50:48.300 --> 00:50:53.020]

original yeah that's it what into the couch and you can see the saliva dripping

[00:52:15.180 --> 00:52:19.560]
down at least I think that's where it was so you cut out for like 10 seconds I

[00:52:20.460 --> 00:52:23.880]
did yeah nobody heard the last 10 seconds came back when your breathing

[00:52:23.880 --> 00:52:27.980]
heavy it was kind of a funny non-sequitriary oh that's because Merb died so I was

[00:52:27.980 --> 00:52:31.500]
I worked up about it or maybe because I said Chris Atkins in the blue

[00:52:31.500 --> 00:52:35.260]
blue hmm what did I cut out for it is the lights are all on everything here is

[00:52:35.260 --> 00:52:38.440]
functioning just fine don't tell me you're having another malfunction at the

[00:52:38.440 --> 00:52:42.640]
judge or somebody in the other room is you know having a good time could be

[00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:45.920]
anything yeah probably probably Alice Marvez is running around there

[00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:52.780]
sabotaging our show because it has nothing to with sports you know that bit

[00:52:52.780 --> 00:52:56.400]
wait I should just put that on a loop oh that let me tell you the positive

[00:52:56.400 --> 00:53:00.540]
feedback from all corners because of that bit sports everyone's favorite

[00:53:00.540 --> 00:53:05.300]
sports sports sports sports yeah I mean what what is this show have to do with

[00:53:05.300 --> 00:53:08.480]
that not with anybody one less than this show when we're not talking about the

[00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:11.400]
dolphin game on Thursday when exhibitionist games that don't come for

[00:53:11.400 --> 00:53:16.120]
nothing and that mean absolutely nothing and the best part of the whole deal is

[00:53:16.120 --> 00:53:19.780]
they had a real difficult they they lifted the blackout on the game was on

[00:53:19.780 --> 00:53:24.780]
television my right Chris correct but it wasn't sold out you know if it was a

[00:53:24.780 --> 00:53:29.920]
regular season game would have been blacked out how embarrassing how humiliating

[00:53:29.920 --> 00:53:34.840]
and degrading but that's south Florida for you a real great sports time that's

[00:53:34.840 --> 00:53:38.940]
why we ought to have like Ray Perry says 50 sports stations on here then it would

[00:53:38.940 --> 00:53:43.620]
bring would attract so many more people to all sports video you know is that

[00:53:43.620 --> 00:53:47.620]
what he said yep thanks for those dolphin tickets by the way Ray better late

[00:53:47.620 --> 00:53:50.320]
than ever that's what the professor says thanks and thanks to George for

[00:53:50.320 --> 00:53:53.960]
delivering them to by the way so that's what you said you were good guys it was

[00:53:53.960 --> 00:53:58.740]
kind of surprising you didn't he wasn't what he expected he said I'm like yeah

love to the world why everybody else is like fill each other all a clearance in

[00:54:15.600 --> 00:54:22.400]
your case will make an exception this is the most disgusting program I urge

[00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:28.400]
everyone to complain to this station I'm Al Gore did you know old fashioned

[00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:33.680]
flush toilets waste valuable clean water well now there's an earth friendly

[00:54:33.680 --> 00:54:39.860]
alternative introducing Al Gore's earth toilet why I have several

[00:54:39.860 --> 00:54:46.280]
earth toilets right my own backyard this one smells like pine well at least

[00:54:46.280 --> 00:54:51.100]
the top part guys tip or use this one morning look there's another earth

[00:54:51.100 --> 00:54:57.120]
toilet that smells just like a rose but out watch out for the thorns we used to

[00:54:57.120 --> 00:55:01.300]
have another earth toilet out in the garden but out of the third note it

[00:55:01.300 --> 00:55:05.980]
personally I prefer using the collection of smaller dwarf

[00:55:05.980 --> 00:55:10.780]
toilets that lie in my front walkway let me show you how they work

[00:55:14.040 --> 00:55:18.600]
wow there's nothing more satisfying than relieving yourself on a bush

[00:55:18.600 --> 00:55:25.340]
oh what the hell are you doing go on saving the planet you're welcome for next time

[00:55:25.340 --> 00:55:30.420]
nature call call on nature with the Al Gore earth toilet available at the

[00:55:30.420 --> 00:55:33.700]
garden center at Wal-Mart so let me ask you this if you had a tooth between

[00:55:33.700 --> 00:55:38.840]
sorry and Al Gore what would you choice be see what I'm saying him of course

[00:55:38.840 --> 00:55:44.460]
course is it any doubt no no but her name is Clinton she was worried about

[00:55:44.460 --> 00:55:47.620]
when everybody still likes bubble and look what we got now pop had bubble look

[00:55:47.620 --> 00:55:50.920]
what we got we got seven hundred ninety eight votes when I click that baby

[00:55:50.920 --> 00:55:57.560]
again we might just have eight hundred and we do we got eight oh two and now you

[00:55:57.560 --> 00:56:01.540]
want to know why that is you want another votes are coming in a big big sloppy

[00:56:01.540 --> 00:56:10.760]
messy smelly chunks you want to know why why because they because they really

[00:56:10.760 --> 00:56:13.860]
believe that if we can get the thousand votes by two o'clock that there won't be

[00:56:13.860 --> 00:56:17.860]
any more sports writers on here we're praying we're begging we're pleading with

[00:56:17.860 --> 00:56:25.820]
you stop you lunatics you maniac stop you can't tell these people anything have

[00:56:25.820 --> 00:56:31.900]
we always know that yes they know it all we know nothing Alex freaking

[00:56:31.900 --> 00:56:35.280]
our vassan Ethan's colonic you know something if there should be like an

[00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:38.640]
accident you know and two of them should get like a butchered in the street

[00:56:38.640 --> 00:56:43.500]
this afternoon that would be very sad you know but and they've hired throw him

[00:56:43.500 --> 00:56:47.420]
throw his ass on the pile to by the way okay days one and hide that's what I

[00:56:47.420 --> 00:56:53.440]
would do if I was you oh god am I leaving anybody out how about Mike Burrino

[00:56:53.440 --> 00:56:56.240]
we still got baseball games going on they're putting that stiff on the air

[00:56:56.240 --> 00:57:00.960]
two still I believe so but what is what is the concept am I missing something

[00:57:00.960 --> 00:57:04.680]
what is it all about Alfie what tell me what it's all the more you talk about sports

[00:57:04.680 --> 00:57:10.660]
the more you understand they're paying the hosts big fat yeah

[00:57:10.660 --> 00:57:15.080]
yeah that's just one guy that's just one guy if you can get all these other

[00:57:15.080 --> 00:57:20.180]
was one guy okay that's only two guys if you can get like five guys in there

[00:57:20.180 --> 00:57:23.200]
they're supposed to know something about sports all talking at the same time

[00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:27.860]
then five times the number of people will want to listen to that

[00:57:27.860 --> 00:57:31.220]
very early this is the worst news I ever heard my life and it's another good

[00:57:31.220 --> 00:57:34.100]
reason to stay out of South Florida they'll never go anywhere near there

[00:57:35.080 --> 00:57:39.200]
very early price toll lanes will be built in the center of I-95 between downtown

[00:57:39.200 --> 00:57:43.420]
Miami and Fort Lauderdale as part of a new federal program aimed at reducing

[00:57:43.420 --> 00:57:47.600]
congestion and enhancing mass transit major urban areas the US Department

[00:57:47.600 --> 00:57:53.180]
of Transportation is announcing today the state will get $62.5 million in

[00:57:53.180 --> 00:57:57.520]
grants to cover the estimated $200 million price tag to convert the underused

[00:57:57.520 --> 00:58:02.240]
and politically unpopular HOV lanes in the center meeting of I-95 into an

[00:58:02.240 --> 00:58:07.800]
all-electronic high occupancy tool a hot facility HOT hot then sound too hot to

[00:58:07.800 --> 00:58:12.420]
me the rest of the money is expected to come from state coffers and could be

[00:58:12.420 --> 00:58:16.800]
repaid in part by tools generated in the new express lanes US transportation

[00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:19.880]
secretary Mary Peters is going to make the announcement at a news conference

[00:58:19.880 --> 00:58:22.720]
I love it a clock this morning but out there too busy talking about Michael

[00:58:22.720 --> 00:58:27.660]
Vic on CNN well maybe I missed it I don't know was it on I didn't see it this

[00:58:27.660 --> 00:58:31.860]
is a huge deal for South Florida said the anxious US representative Mary O'Day

[00:58:31.860 --> 00:58:35.060]
as Bullard Republican of Miami who sits on the House Transportation Committee

[00:58:36.060 --> 00:58:39.060]
we're going to be one of only five chosen we're going to be at the forefront of

[00:58:39.060 --> 00:58:42.140]
some serious innovations he said I really believe this is going to have a pretty

[00:58:42.140 --> 00:58:45.900]
dramatic impact on traffic it's been done in other places and it works

[00:58:48.040 --> 00:58:51.180]
everything that's done in other places and works doesn't work in South

[00:58:51.180 --> 00:58:57.360]
Florida Lincoln Mary O which ever one of the DS Blarcy are Mary O the grants are

[00:58:57.360 --> 00:59:00.420]
among 1.1 billion dollars being offered to five urban areas nationwide to try

[00:59:00.420 --> 00:59:04.180]
innovative approaches to ease mounted congestion problems the 95 express

[00:59:04.180 --> 00:59:08.880]
plan would convert the H.O.V. lanes to two express total lanes in each direction

[00:59:08.880 --> 00:59:15.120]
for the 21 miles between 3.95 in Miami and 5.95 in Fort Lauderdale

[00:59:15.120 --> 00:59:18.120]
traffic will be permitted to enter an exit at five points along the route

[00:59:18.860 --> 00:59:24.100]
express lanes total lanes the highways current configuration would change

[00:59:24.100 --> 00:59:27.460]
and I don't know if anywhere else am I wrong are there tools that I

[00:59:27.700 --> 00:59:32.580]
state highways in the country that I know about I don't know maybe but I don't

[00:59:34.200 --> 00:59:37.260]
know I was a configuration which in some the squeeze in the extra lanes

[00:59:37.260 --> 00:59:40.780]
especially in date where the highway is narrower and confined by nearby

[00:59:40.780 --> 00:59:44.440]
development most lanes that we reduced from 12 feet wide to 11 feet wide the

[00:59:44.440 --> 00:59:47.340]
median and shoulders and also shrink which of course knowing the kind of

[00:59:47.340 --> 00:59:51.100]
driving you have in South Florida ought to make for a really beautiful beautiful

[00:59:51.100 --> 00:59:57.400]
situation not tools would be collected electronically through some past and they

[00:59:57.400 --> 01:00:00.860]
would vary depending on the amount of traffic on the highway when traffic is

[01:00:00.860 --> 01:00:04.400]
like the tools will be low as more vehicles opt to use the express lanes the

[01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:07.940]
price will rise volumes will be monitored via electronic sensors in the

[01:00:07.940 --> 01:00:11.500]
roadway and cameras monitored by transportation workers to guarantee a 50-mile

[01:00:11.500 --> 01:00:16.960]
hour journey electronic signs posted before the express lanes would flash the

[01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:20.240]
toll rate and how much time drivers could potentially save by using the

[01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:25.200]
express route instead of the non-tools in the release lanes you following this in

[01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:27.940]
other words it's not going to be a toll road all the way if you use the

[01:00:27.940 --> 01:00:32.140]
non-tool general use lanes then and so what do you think people are going to do

[01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:34.940]
it depends on if they're shluppers or not

[01:00:35.740 --> 01:00:38.980]
slay on a break and get in the free lane right when you say all it's going to be

[01:00:38.980 --> 01:00:43.520]
a hundred bucks a minute traffic plan is speculated a driver during rush hour

[01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:47.660]
might pay 30 cents a mile about 30 minutes or six bucks to go from my meter

[01:00:47.660 --> 01:00:52.860]
four-loader deal during less travel times until it'll be much lower six bucks

[01:00:52.860 --> 01:00:56.620]
to drive from my meter four-loader deal plus the gas of course that that's just

[01:00:56.620 --> 01:01:01.580]
the toll 30 cents a freaking mile public buses and registered carpoolers with three

[01:01:01.580 --> 01:01:05.800]
or more occupants will be allowed to use the express lanes for free after the

[01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:08.320]
OT will also be using some of the revenue generated the tooling area that

[01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:11.420]
buses in the day the bar transit fleets that will run the length of the corridor

[01:01:11.420 --> 01:01:14.440]
instead of the current situation where cross-county commuters are forced to

[01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:18.680]
transfer between systems at the county line everybody get out and walk now

[01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:23.380]
beside the promises feeding up bus rides and 95 express plans could also be

[01:01:23.380 --> 01:01:26.760]
do intercounty rapid bus routes instead of riders having to transfer buses

[01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:29.980]
between Dayton-Broward traffic plan herself to begin the project this year and

[01:01:29.980 --> 01:01:33.740]
completed by late 2008 it don't sound too great to me but what do I know

[01:01:33.740 --> 01:01:37.820]
you know I say the good deal would be if they put all the sports riders out

[01:01:37.820 --> 01:01:40.240]
there in the highway and let everybody like run them over would be good we can

[01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:43.220]
broadcast it live that's a good idea

[01:01:45.420 --> 01:01:46.140]
great idea

[01:01:47.980 --> 01:01:52.180]
maybe you find clearance yet or what no I can hop around looking for to do what

[01:01:52.180 --> 01:01:56.000]
so that he can lock in my face now I'm talking about Chris not you oh so

[01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:59.880]
can lock in Swiss's face I think I look for him but you know but what do you

[01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:03.800]
really want me to no if we get to a thousand votes by two o'clock no more

[01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:09.280]
sports riders ever on Q.A.M. ever not even allowed in the building not only

[01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:14.780]
they pay these guys and and I guarantee they're feeding them to him all right I

[01:02:14.780 --> 01:02:19.360]
don't know no idea you don't think that they're they're they're chowling up

[01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:21.720]
or that free of crap from how he's never anybody else that they bring in

[01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:26.060]
every morning you think that they're just sitting there passing on by oh who

[01:02:26.060 --> 01:02:32.240]
are you can sports riders are the worst in fact who was it that was always

[01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:34.160]
bitching about the food in the press box

[01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:41.440]

and you're just thinking you put it on there 3 30 yesterday fat so what you

[01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:54.860]
know what's a big deal if you can get a thousand votes tomorrow that would

[01:02:54.860 --> 01:02:59.540]
seal the deal all right so come up with a really nifty pull not want to

[01:02:59.540 --> 01:03:03.280]
Charlie be stupid as pulls like how many games are they dolphins gonna win this

[01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:28.120]
Lindsey Paris the quote Brittany keep getting into the only answer of course is

who the hell cares if you have even oh Phil Rosino is dead the scooter oh no

[01:03:33.740 --> 01:03:37.880]

[01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:41.540]
time you always remember baseball hall of fame until he just broke 89 and he was

[01:03:41.540 --> 01:03:47.020]
in fact the oldest living member of the scooter only cow only cow he was awful

[01:03:47.020 --> 01:03:52.100]
man with good ball player great shortstop by boy he was one of the worst broad

[01:03:52.100 --> 01:03:53.840]
characters in this way only cow

[01:03:55.520 --> 01:03:59.280]
horrible and there's another case in epithism not not and there in epithism is

[01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:04.340]
when it's family right yes a crony is him is that a better word to use sure

[01:04:04.340 --> 01:04:08.640]
isn't yeah that's why he had that job for all those eight-zillion years and

[01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:13.200]
Steinbrenner told him one time so I'm told because you wanted to retire about a

[01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:16.320]
hundred years ago and he told him still you'll retire what I attended a

[01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:20.520]
retire how do you like that that's the kind of crap that people with a lot of

[01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:23.560]
money like George Steinbrenner do and then their team lines of sucking wind

[01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:26.380]
there's no second one aren't they this season the Yankees by the way yes the

[01:04:26.380 --> 01:04:30.360]
Red Sox 80 games ahead I hope not that far they're they're pretty far ahead

[01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:35.480]
the blue jay sucked to by the way favorite Jewish community of all time Roddy

[01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:40.420]
danger field is kicking ass baby 161 and Mel Brooks is doing nice in second with 98

[01:04:40.420 --> 01:04:45.380]
but not even close out of eight 28th we are definitely going to top a thousand

[01:04:45.380 --> 01:04:49.200]
votes today all sports writers entering the QM building will be shot on site

[01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:50.440]
after today political

[01:04:53.140 --> 01:04:54.300]
absolutely

[01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:01.480]
so

[01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:06.460]
I don't feel computers, that's because the internet is through a modern music

[01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:11.540]
You can't make a decent song if you do it online

[01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:18.340]
I should know I have to rent a cut song since 79

[01:05:20.540 --> 01:05:24.340]
Yeah, my voice and youth, you've got the soul of a sense

[01:05:24.340 --> 01:05:27.680]
That's why I'm so freaked out

[01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:30.060]
But but but but play me a genet

[01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:35.020]
Sure of the peace I just want to fall

[01:05:35.020 --> 01:05:37.640]
But I'm glad it is what I've seen

[01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:38.320]
Huh?

[01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:41.120]
Don't have to screw up eyes

[01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:45.220]
Girl, I'm a night, but I'm acting like a spoiled queen

[01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:47.040]
Up the...

[01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:49.060]
You're fairytale

[01:05:49.060 --> 01:05:51.160]
But but but play me a genet

[01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:55.940]
They don't, they don't

[01:05:55.940 --> 01:05:58.600]
I'm not a genet

[01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:06.800]
Love a 31 at 560 WDQM, so you never answered my question about whether I should go and see all these

[01:06:07.780 --> 01:06:09.900]
Stodgy old parts that I haven't seen in 50 years

[01:06:09.900 --> 01:06:12.520]
At my 50th class reunion in 2010

[01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.160]
Well, I can answer for you since he's not currently here

[01:06:15.160 --> 01:06:17.880]
Oh George went out and now, did he limp out of there or what?

[01:06:18.120 --> 01:06:19.760]
Oh, he limps everywhere he goes right now

[01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:20.140]
Yeah

[01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:23.960]
Um, someone give him the uh, a nickname that I'm not gonna say what you know

[01:06:25.580 --> 01:06:28.660]
But uh, you know, he's uh, he said he might be not be back on time

[01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:31.800]
And um, just uh, pray for him

[01:06:34.580 --> 01:06:36.240]
I wonder if I had something to do with

[01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:37.400]
I wouldn't be surprised

[01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:39.260]
I think he's trying to drown Joyce's what he said

[01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:42.400]
Forget about him, can we get back to my class reunion?

[01:06:42.620 --> 01:06:43.100]
I think you should go

[01:06:44.360 --> 01:06:46.940]
And see people that I haven't seen in 50 years

[01:06:47.340 --> 01:06:52.700]
Look at it this way, you're probably uh, the best looking of the group or at least in the top 10%

[01:06:52.700 --> 01:06:55.220]
You can kind of go, but you don't, you don't even feel better about yourself

[01:06:55.220 --> 01:06:58.020]
It's the only time in my life I've ever looked better than my classmates

[01:06:58.020 --> 01:07:00.840]
Is once I guess we got past 50, I guess, you know

[01:07:00.840 --> 01:07:05.100]
Yeah, see? So, you know, go give me some uh, a little bit of boost of confidence, how's that?

[01:07:07.540 --> 01:07:08.860]
A boost in confidence?

[01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:10.700]
Yeah, as opposed to what?

[01:07:11.260 --> 01:07:14.620]
As opposed to going there and like, you know, having everybody look at you like, wow, what happened to you?

[01:07:14.700 --> 01:07:16.360]
Well, what does that mean? A boost in confidence?

[01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:17.480]
It is such a shot

[01:07:17.900 --> 01:07:21.440]
That's like saying, oh, you have such a, uh, inferiority complex, Neo, no

[01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:22.800]
I would never say that

[01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:27.540]
1528 friends in my space, that's not too shabby exactly

[01:07:27.540 --> 01:07:31.640]
And if Miguel wouldn't have gotten fired, he'd be around there and he could come and say, what a great job

[01:07:31.640 --> 01:07:33.320]
Neo, but he's got, can because

[01:07:33.320 --> 01:07:37.020]
Fathast Jolly Jolada bringing one of his cronies from Raleigh to take his job

[01:07:37.020 --> 01:07:37.920]
He still listens

[01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:42.240]
I every now and then I get a thing from him on my space

[01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:44.300]
He's one of our 1528 friends

[01:07:44.980 --> 01:07:47.340]
So the scooter is dead, here's the story

[01:07:47.340 --> 01:07:48.440]
I thought he already was

[01:07:49.860 --> 01:07:50.940]
Yeah, how can you tell?

[01:07:51.420 --> 01:07:51.600]
Exactly

[01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:55.780]
Phil resuited the Hall of Fame shortstop after the Yankees dynasty years and beloved by

[01:07:55.780 --> 01:07:58.160]
the, beloved by who? Okay, by idiots?

[01:07:59.060 --> 01:08:01.140]
A generation of fans for explaining

[01:08:01.140 --> 01:08:04.000]
Holy cow is a broadcast to die today, he was 89

[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.600]
First of all, he stole Holy cow from Harry Curie

[01:08:06.600 --> 01:08:08.800]
And number two, he never said holy cow was always

[01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:11.320]
OLY, he left off the age, OLY cow

[01:08:14.220 --> 01:08:14.860]
He was

[01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:19.980]
He was a broadcast, you're like, I'm a brain surgeon, okay?

[01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:22.600]
His death was confirmed by the Yankees,

[01:08:22.660 --> 01:08:24.240]
Visuda have been to the Climbing Health for several years,

[01:08:24.360 --> 01:08:26.800]
was living at a nursing home in West R&S New Jersey

[01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:31.640]
Visuda known as the scooter played for the Yankees throughout the 40s and 50s

[01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:33.680]
and won seven world series as his titles

[01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:37.780]
The scooter is dead, oh what a, what a banter week

[01:08:37.780 --> 01:08:38.960]
It's only Tuesday

[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.040]
Once they did more griffin' that was over the weekend one

[01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:44.240]
I think Sunday was it Sunday?

[01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:44.980]
I think so

[01:08:45.340 --> 01:08:45.700]
Good

[01:08:46.360 --> 01:08:48.000]
See, that's supposed to say that, that's so

[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.900]
Well, he was 82, which is, I mean, 82's not that old,

[01:08:50.900 --> 01:08:53.080]
especially when you're 64, like me, almost 65

[01:08:53.080 --> 01:08:54.640]
But the scooter was 89

[01:08:56.220 --> 01:08:58.920]
And living in a nursing home in West R&S New Jersey

[01:08:58.920 --> 01:09:00.660]
Because they say New York, West R&S

[01:09:00.660 --> 01:09:02.540]
You can't say orange, it has to be orange

[01:09:02.540 --> 01:09:04.180]
And then you know you're from New York

[01:09:04.180 --> 01:09:05.960]
And you probably have not just like Sid the Kid

[01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:09.720]
When you start talking with that real heavy New York accent

[01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:11.620]
And really just, just rub it in

[01:09:11.620 --> 01:09:13.720]
Yes, I read that blog and that was just kind of

[01:09:14.280 --> 01:09:16.300]
The comments, I guess, to that blog, that's just kind of sad

[01:09:17.580 --> 01:09:21.600]
Yeah, every blog, every website, even political websites

[01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:25.080]
Where they're supposed to be like, you know, some intelligent people reading it

[01:09:25.080 --> 01:09:27.640]
And you assume that anybody that would be involved in it might have an IQ

[01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:28.820]
Larger than their thing

[01:09:28.820 --> 01:09:29.660]
Well guess what?

[01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:34.180]
Anybody on the internet, 90% of the people that waste their time writing comments are morons

[01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:37.160]
It's a peeing contest, that's all it is

[01:09:37.160 --> 01:09:39.480]
It's a peeing contest to see who can tickle the most

[01:09:39.940 --> 01:09:42.840]
I got it right here if you want to like waste our time with it

[01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:45.720]
And if you look at his blog, Ethan Skolnik

[01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:48.160]
This is from what day was this

[01:09:48.160 --> 01:09:49.580]
Doesn't even have a date on it

[01:09:49.580 --> 01:09:53.500]
It's got a time, 127 am, but doesn't have a date

[01:09:53.500 --> 01:09:55.040]
Nice going, Ethan, you idiot

[01:09:57.500 --> 01:09:58.640]
Doesn't even have a date

[01:09:59.460 --> 01:10:00.800]
Oh, I hear it is 813

[01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:01.840]
Well, I was eating yesterday

[01:10:02.740 --> 01:10:04.720]
No, I guess that's the date I printed it out

[01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:05.300]
I don't know

[01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:09.560]
Anyway, he says the sports media industry is insensuous

[01:10:09.560 --> 01:10:11.260]
Whether in newspapers or radio or TV

[01:10:11.260 --> 01:10:13.740]
A lot of us end up working at more than one place in a market

[01:10:13.740 --> 01:10:16.720]
No, Schmidt, Ethan, and by the way, your Schmidt do stink

[01:10:17.780 --> 01:10:19.420]
That's what Kimba Bocavige told us

[01:10:19.420 --> 01:10:23.780]
Really, really bad, too, he said like, oh, take a whiff of that and pass out

[01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:28.380]
On that note, he says South Florida sports radio is getting a serious shake up

[01:10:28.380 --> 01:10:29.040]
Wow

[01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:33.120]
Jorge Sedano, who used to host the 0940 AM

[01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:36.120]
And has been recently doing the overnight guy for his Fox Sports radio

[01:10:36.120 --> 01:10:37.540]
By handling heat stu-

[01:10:37.540 --> 01:10:38.840]
Uh, he is stu-

[01:10:38.840 --> 01:10:39.600]
The shrimp was a lipis back

[01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:42.260]
Oh, the shrimp of the limpis back the sheen

[01:10:42.260 --> 01:10:44.340]
This thing is spot at 790 AM

[01:10:44.340 --> 01:10:46.160]
As you probably know writes, Ethan

[01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:50.680]
Joe Rosen, Jesse, Jesse, Jackson, Jackson will be taking over the morning show on 560 in September

[01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:53.200]
So it's not a secret, George, I don't have to like dummy up

[01:10:54.580 --> 01:10:55.420]
What's not a secret

[01:10:55.880 --> 01:10:59.140]
And Steve Goldstein has moved from 560 to 790

[01:10:59.140 --> 01:11:01.380]
Where he's been filling in says Ethan's school

[01:11:01.380 --> 01:11:04.060]
That Joe Rosen is starting September 3rd on QAM

[01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:07.540]
Ethan says it's not easy to keep straight

[01:11:07.540 --> 01:11:08.760]
So here are the regular weekday lunch

[01:11:08.760 --> 01:11:09.940]
He doesn't even have the time

[01:11:09.940 --> 01:11:10.980]
Are you looking at this thing?

[01:11:11.460 --> 01:11:12.740]
Chris, I look at it before, yeah

[01:11:12.740 --> 01:11:15.420]
What kind of an article is this, Ethan

[01:11:15.420 --> 01:11:18.740]
And we put you on the ear like you're like you're a credible human being

[01:11:18.740 --> 01:11:20.380]
That's he, it's not an article, it's a blog

[01:11:20.380 --> 01:11:21.300]
They can do whatever they want

[01:11:23.780 --> 01:11:25.620]
He says here are the regular weekday lunch

[01:11:25.620 --> 01:11:27.640]
So these guys tend to take their share of time also

[01:11:27.640 --> 01:11:29.080]
They hear different voices on different days

[01:11:29.080 --> 01:11:31.480]
You'll hear the dolphins program on 560 now

[01:11:31.480 --> 01:11:34.160]
You'll also hear more sentinel voices on 560

[01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:35.740]
And Harold voices on 790

[01:11:35.740 --> 01:11:38.340]
That's because they have that incestuous relationship across the street

[01:11:38.340 --> 01:11:39.520]
With a freaking Harold

[01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:42.660]
With Dan La Bastard and Greg Cotex in that bunch

[01:11:43.380 --> 01:11:46.560]
So no, I won't be reprising the role I had on George's previous local show

[01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:48.400]
He says meaning George Sedano

[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:50.300]
Jorge as opposed to

[01:11:50.300 --> 01:11:53.360]
So I guess like tomorrow you can listen to Jorge midday or Jorge

[01:11:53.960 --> 01:11:54.600]
I'm sure

[01:11:55.220 --> 01:11:55.500]
Right

[01:11:56.180 --> 01:11:57.760]
Right, but we'll be talking about you know

[01:11:58.640 --> 01:12:00.220]
560s got Orlando Alzacrari

[01:12:00.220 --> 01:12:02.140]
Joe Rosen Jason Jackson after that

[01:12:02.140 --> 01:12:03.760]
Neil Rogers even mentioned my name

[01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:04.920]
Thank you Ethan so much

[01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:06.120]
You idiot you loser

[01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:06.660]
You

[01:12:06.660 --> 01:12:07.640]
D'Afrari

[01:12:07.640 --> 01:12:10.320]
And I dog Hankel Brigad Kaplan

[01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:11.520]
And then first off the bench

[01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:13.760]
Kim Bo camper Evan Cohen and Curtis Stevenson

[01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:14.700]
First off the bench

[01:12:14.700 --> 01:12:18.320]
You see how everything is going to have a sports analogy

[01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:19.400]
First off the bench

[01:12:20.860 --> 01:12:22.400]
Civilities in Rosenberg aka

[01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:23.820]
Notches New Yorker

[01:12:23.820 --> 01:12:24.920]
George Sedano

[01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:26.780]
And no times on these shows

[01:12:26.780 --> 01:12:27.940]
Nobody's got any times

[01:12:27.940 --> 01:12:29.800]
Bouges Chambie with Zanzlo

[01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:30.540]
Who is Zanzlo

[01:12:30.540 --> 01:12:31.500]
I thought he's the guy that played

[01:12:31.500 --> 01:12:33.400]
He's his perturbing player getting light

[01:12:33.400 --> 01:12:33.660]
Oh

[01:12:33.660 --> 01:12:34.940]
So why do we need that

[01:12:35.480 --> 01:12:37.220]
Well he's kind of become part of the show

[01:12:38.220 --> 01:12:39.940]
Dan Labaster John Wiener

[01:12:39.940 --> 01:12:41.020]
And of course Hock

[01:12:41.020 --> 01:12:42.800]
Hock how do you say that

[01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:45.340]
Other H O C H

[01:12:45.340 --> 01:12:46.680]
Hock Marnishkin Trinic

[01:12:47.300 --> 01:12:49.160]
Kevin Rogers and Ados Amigos

[01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:50.780]
Wow a first off the bench

[01:12:50.780 --> 01:12:52.060]
Steve Gellie Gelstein

[01:12:52.580 --> 01:12:54.420]
Jeff DeForest and Jeremy Marx Peltz

[01:12:58.220 --> 01:12:59.260]
Whatever that means

[01:13:00.200 --> 01:13:01.960]
And then it's got all the

[01:13:01.960 --> 01:13:03.120]
Comments on here

[01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:04.320]
Posted by this loser

[01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:05.260]
And posted by this

[01:13:05.260 --> 01:13:06.080]
Another loser

[01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:08.020]
Happy in the sunrise

[01:13:08.020 --> 01:13:09.800]
And Sammy and Eric and Shmendrick

[01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:10.580]
And this one and that

[01:13:10.580 --> 01:13:11.780]
Oh my god

[01:13:11.780 --> 01:13:12.940]
The great comments are when

[01:13:12.940 --> 01:13:14.960]
People from 790 post on it

[01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:16.220]
Not just said other people did

[01:13:16.220 --> 01:13:17.280]
No do they

[01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:17.800]
Well of course

[01:13:17.800 --> 01:13:19.340]
The ones where they're kissing their ass

[01:13:19.340 --> 01:13:20.580]
Naturally, where do you think they came from

[01:13:20.580 --> 01:13:21.000]
The audience

[01:13:21.400 --> 01:13:22.280]
Here's a good comment

[01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:23.780]
Though as long as DeForest is not on

[01:13:23.780 --> 01:13:24.460]
It's a good day

[01:13:26.920 --> 01:13:28.380]
They hate you DeForest

[01:13:28.380 --> 01:13:30.720]
Although he kicked the big rose ass

[01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:31.840]
And last walk saw it

[01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:32.800]
And then they blew him out of there

[01:13:33.740 --> 01:13:35.240]
As Joel Feinberg continues

[01:13:35.240 --> 01:13:36.620]
See Joel you fit in perfect

[01:13:36.620 --> 01:13:37.180]
In the market

[01:13:37.180 --> 01:13:38.160]
I never thought you could do it

[01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:39.360]
But you finally got the message

[01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:40.160]
If it's

[01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:41.700]
If it's not broken

[01:13:41.700 --> 01:13:42.680]
Ditto with it

[01:13:43.420 --> 01:13:44.360]
If it's working

[01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:45.180]
Fix it

[01:13:45.180 --> 01:13:46.680]
Break it into a million pieces

[01:13:46.680 --> 01:13:48.200]
Like Greg Reed and then try to fix it

[01:13:48.200 --> 01:13:49.740]
Like Jolly Joe Fad as Bell

[01:13:51.320 --> 01:13:53.120]
No more sports writers

[01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:54.620]
Okay because we're gonna make the thousand

[01:13:54.620 --> 01:13:55.440]
Easy today

[01:13:56.260 --> 01:13:58.040]
I think I've given them an extra incentive

[01:13:59.780 --> 01:14:00.220]
850

[01:14:01.880 --> 01:14:02.320]
850

[01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:02.480]
850

[01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:04.260]
Now is that that Steve Lapa

[01:14:04.260 --> 01:14:06.160]
Nightmare 850 is that WFTL

[01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:07.000]
Which used to be on 1400

[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:08.360]
And they move the callators

[01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:09.460]
Or rather they don't have no audience

[01:14:09.460 --> 01:14:11.360]
That's where the man cows got a share

[01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:12.880]
And Bill O'Roddy's got a

[01:14:12.880 --> 01:14:13.060]
Oh

[01:14:13.060 --> 01:14:13.540]
Share

[01:14:14.540 --> 01:14:15.680]
Like Norma Kent said

[01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:17.340]
If Steve Lapa's got the

[01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:18.980]
Midest touch and reverse

[01:14:18.980 --> 01:14:20.700]
Everything he touches turns to the

[01:14:20.700 --> 01:14:21.260]
Slides

[01:14:21.260 --> 01:14:22.020]
Fudge back in

[01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:24.280]
Absolutely

[01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:29.400]
Oh

[01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:31.800]
Can't believe what I just saw

[01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:34.080]
That woman do

[01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:35.800]
Oh my god

[01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:40.600]
Reach stuff and grab my husband's

[01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:41.280]
Joke

[01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:45.540]
She's lucky I didn't jump

[01:14:45.540 --> 01:14:48.220]
Right off the stage

[01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:50.620]
And then

[01:14:50.620 --> 01:14:54.180]
Take her out with just one punch

[01:14:55.140 --> 01:14:57.160]
Because you know you shouldn't squeeze

[01:14:57.160 --> 01:14:58.900]
You'd better let them be

[01:14:58.900 --> 01:15:01.300]
Keep your hands on the family

[01:15:01.300 --> 01:15:02.000]
Truth

[01:15:02.580 --> 01:15:04.160]
It's really kind of proof

[01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:05.680]
To grab his back and try

[01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:06.400]
And run

[01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:07.580]
Of me

[01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:11.100]
Love what you can't touch

[01:15:11.100 --> 01:15:12.280]
You shouldn't gather

[01:15:12.280 --> 01:15:12.840]
Nothing

[01:15:12.840 --> 01:15:13.380]
Lay

[01:15:13.380 --> 01:15:15.460]
Or better learn

[01:15:15.460 --> 01:15:16.380]
This thing's

[01:15:16.380 --> 01:15:18.100]
Bill O'Roddy

[01:15:18.100 --> 01:15:19.400]
To me

[01:15:23.260 --> 01:15:25.240]
You know you shouldn't squeeze

[01:15:27.320 --> 01:15:28.100]
Unless you mean

[01:15:28.980 --> 01:15:29.560]
Remain it

[01:15:30.420 --> 01:15:30.820]
Just

[01:15:31.420 --> 01:15:31.820]
Squeeze

[01:15:34.220 --> 01:15:35.660]
I'd bet you George was squeezing

[01:15:35.660 --> 01:15:36.520]
For good reason here

[01:15:36.520 --> 01:15:37.400]
In the last few minutes

[01:15:37.400 --> 01:15:38.300]
Now you were out there

[01:15:38.300 --> 01:15:39.020]
Doing your squeeze

[01:15:39.020 --> 01:15:40.160]
When I asked Chris about the

[01:15:40.160 --> 01:15:41.200]
53 union

[01:15:41.200 --> 01:15:42.100]
And whether I should go or not

[01:15:42.100 --> 01:15:42.860]
He said oh yeah

[01:15:42.860 --> 01:15:43.640]
You're gonna look better

[01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:44.360]
Than anybody else

[01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:45.340]
And it'll be great

[01:15:45.340 --> 01:15:45.980]
And he said

[01:15:45.980 --> 01:15:47.500]
They'll reinforce your confidence

[01:15:48.280 --> 01:15:48.680]
Yeah

[01:15:48.680 --> 01:15:49.100]
You said

[01:15:50.140 --> 01:15:51.600]
Such low quality theme

[01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:51.920]
You know

[01:15:51.920 --> 01:15:53.520]
You said such a shrinking violet

[01:15:53.520 --> 01:15:54.660]
Well what does that mean

[01:15:54.660 --> 01:15:55.380]
Chris

[01:15:56.260 --> 01:15:57.020]
That's what he said

[01:15:57.020 --> 01:15:57.760]
It was a real shot

[01:15:57.760 --> 01:15:58.720]
And he then he denied it

[01:15:58.720 --> 01:15:59.400]
Then he protected it

[01:15:59.400 --> 01:15:59.960]
And he didn't see that

[01:16:00.360 --> 01:16:01.140]
Full of crap

[01:16:01.620 --> 01:16:02.760]
So you think I should go

[01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:05.360]
I would

[01:16:05.980 --> 01:16:06.780]
If I were you

[01:16:06.780 --> 01:16:07.720]
If I were you

[01:16:09.080 --> 01:16:10.980]
You got way more impressive stuff

[01:16:10.980 --> 01:16:11.580]
To be far

[01:16:11.580 --> 01:16:11.940]
Yeah

[01:16:12.440 --> 01:16:13.340]
Candidate will academy

[01:16:13.340 --> 01:16:13.680]
Baby

[01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:15.040]
Candidate when he or she's right

[01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:16.400]
You'll be the only one showing up

[01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:17.440]
It's like that

[01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:18.720]
Big radio star you know

[01:16:18.720 --> 01:16:19.580]
Yeah that's right

[01:16:19.580 --> 01:16:20.280]
That's what it's all about

[01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:21.740]
Is about who gets to brag the most

[01:16:21.740 --> 01:16:23.300]
Well I am told that I'm the most

[01:16:23.300 --> 01:16:24.780]
I mean enough that this is something

[01:16:24.780 --> 01:16:25.980]
That's gonna run on my tombstone

[01:16:25.980 --> 01:16:27.220]
But I'm the most successful

[01:16:28.460 --> 01:16:28.860]
Graduate

[01:16:28.860 --> 01:16:30.060]
Every day they were academy

[01:16:30.060 --> 01:16:30.580]
In history

[01:16:30.580 --> 01:16:31.240]
Sure

[01:16:32.380 --> 01:16:34.180]
Well since how many 10,000 people

[01:16:34.180 --> 01:16:34.960]
It's not like it's some

[01:16:34.960 --> 01:16:36.180]
Oh although you know

[01:16:36.180 --> 01:16:37.680]
There were a lot of really bright kids

[01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:38.240]
And my class

[01:16:38.240 --> 01:16:39.020]
And a lot of hot

[01:16:39.020 --> 01:16:40.120]
Oh baby

[01:16:40.120 --> 01:16:40.840]
Woo

[01:16:40.840 --> 01:16:41.720]
When something

[01:16:41.720 --> 01:16:43.120]
I would go back

[01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:44.800]
If they looked like they did back then

[01:16:46.160 --> 01:16:47.640]
But you know how depressing it is

[01:16:47.640 --> 01:16:49.800]
To see somebody 50 years after you've seen them before

[01:16:50.340 --> 01:16:51.300]
The last time

[01:16:51.300 --> 01:16:52.620]
No I don't

[01:16:52.620 --> 01:16:54.740]
Somebody who looked really really a great

[01:16:55.280 --> 01:16:57.000]
And then you see them for 50 years later

[01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:57.260]
It's like

[01:16:57.260 --> 01:16:58.280]
It's like if you had a

[01:16:58.280 --> 01:17:00.380]
I've used this comparison before

[01:17:00.380 --> 01:17:01.180]
I think it's valid

[01:17:02.060 --> 01:17:03.380]
If you went through Ruth Chris

[01:17:03.380 --> 01:17:04.360]
Or some really good steak

[01:17:04.360 --> 01:17:06.800]
Has a nice juicy steak on a plate

[01:17:06.800 --> 01:17:07.180]
You know

[01:17:07.180 --> 01:17:07.780]
Uh-huh

[01:17:07.780 --> 01:17:09.900]
And then 50 years later

[01:17:09.900 --> 01:17:12.220]
They just left it sitting there for 50 years

[01:17:12.220 --> 01:17:12.600]
You know

[01:17:14.500 --> 01:17:15.000]
Uh-huh

[01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:16.140]
And you went back 50 years later

[01:17:16.140 --> 01:17:17.460]
And looked at the same piece of meat

[01:17:17.460 --> 01:17:18.940]
If I can say that

[01:17:18.940 --> 01:17:20.080]
You follow what I'm saying

[01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:21.280]
You could be appetizing

[01:17:21.280 --> 01:17:21.920]
You think you say

[01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:23.500]
Mmm the wish

[01:17:23.500 --> 01:17:23.820]
You did

[01:17:23.820 --> 01:17:25.200]
Oh god

[01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:27.580]
Am I right?

[01:17:27.820 --> 01:17:27.960]
Yep

[01:17:27.960 --> 01:17:29.460]
So why should I go then

[01:17:29.460 --> 01:17:31.340]
But there's more to it than that

[01:17:31.340 --> 01:17:32.060]
What do they look?

[01:17:32.260 --> 01:17:32.580]
That's right

[01:17:32.580 --> 01:17:32.940]
Exactly

[01:17:33.480 --> 01:17:34.180]
None of them

[01:17:34.180 --> 01:17:36.140]
None of them are good looking anymore

[01:17:36.140 --> 01:17:36.800]
Right

[01:17:36.800 --> 01:17:37.940]
For sure

[01:17:37.940 --> 01:17:39.680]
Going back for the other reasons

[01:17:39.680 --> 01:17:41.580]
Like maybe there were some people that you like

[01:17:41.580 --> 01:17:43.900]
Maybe you had some friends in those days

[01:17:43.900 --> 01:17:44.860]
I don't know

[01:17:44.860 --> 01:17:45.880]
Well, that's a show

[01:17:45.880 --> 01:17:47.360]
Ha ha ha ha ha

[01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:49.140]
Oh no there were people I liked

[01:17:49.560 --> 01:17:52.200]
There was Ronnie Stiggins involved with his fooling

[01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:53.020]
And um

[01:17:53.020 --> 01:17:54.820]
I'm trying to think of anybody else

[01:17:56.040 --> 01:17:58.160]
And the Grisner kids they were in my class

[01:17:58.160 --> 01:17:59.680]
The boy they sure looked good

[01:17:59.680 --> 01:18:01.320]
Ralph Harris he was in my class

[01:18:02.920 --> 01:18:05.260]
I actually confabulated online with the

[01:18:05.260 --> 01:18:07.220]
I don't know two or three of these people over the years

[01:18:08.100 --> 01:18:09.660]
Ralph Harris I would like have assessed

[01:18:09.660 --> 01:18:11.220]
I had like a

[01:18:11.220 --> 01:18:13.100]
A wild obsession

[01:18:16.340 --> 01:18:17.960]
But but that's 50 years ago

[01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:19.380]
And I know he doesn't look that good now

[01:18:19.380 --> 01:18:20.840]
Because I've seen pictures of how he looks now

[01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:21.500]
And he don't look all that

[01:18:21.500 --> 01:18:22.800]
But he's like my age

[01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:23.540]
He's the same age

[01:18:23.540 --> 01:18:24.820]
He's an old fart like me

[01:18:25.420 --> 01:18:25.780]
Okay

[01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:29.320]
And you keep saying that doesn't make any difference

[01:18:29.320 --> 01:18:30.640]
Well of course it makes a difference

[01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:31.480]
When you go and you see

[01:18:31.480 --> 01:18:32.800]
Because I've seen the pictures

[01:18:32.800 --> 01:18:33.880]
My friend David Benson

[01:18:33.880 --> 01:18:36.020]
I told you I came up here a couple of years ago

[01:18:36.020 --> 01:18:36.440]
And I

[01:18:36.440 --> 01:18:37.340]
I took him and his

[01:18:37.340 --> 01:18:37.620]
A

[01:18:39.640 --> 01:18:40.120]
girlfriend

[01:18:40.120 --> 01:18:41.400]
No not his wife

[01:18:41.400 --> 01:18:42.840]
His girlfriend do a word crisp

[01:18:42.840 --> 01:18:43.980]
Yeah I know how that goes

[01:18:44.780 --> 01:18:45.800]
No it went great

[01:18:45.800 --> 01:18:46.160]
It went

[01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:47.300]
We had a good time

[01:18:47.300 --> 01:18:48.160]
I told the story

[01:18:48.760 --> 01:18:50.980]
But anyway he has emailed me

[01:18:50.980 --> 01:18:52.740]
The pictures of some of these people

[01:18:52.740 --> 01:18:53.160]
And

[01:18:53.860 --> 01:18:55.060]
Oh my god

[01:18:55.060 --> 01:18:56.360]
It's just you want to cry

[01:18:56.360 --> 01:18:57.900]
No if that's all there was

[01:18:57.900 --> 01:18:59.220]
If that's the only thing that

[01:18:59.220 --> 01:19:00.340]
It's just to be about them

[01:19:00.340 --> 01:19:01.640]
Is how they look then don't

[01:19:01.640 --> 01:19:03.060]
But if you had some friends

[01:19:03.060 --> 01:19:04.400]
That you'd like to see again

[01:19:05.020 --> 01:19:05.340]
No

[01:19:05.340 --> 01:19:06.580]
Then don't

[01:19:06.580 --> 01:19:08.200]
Well by look if if I had a captain

[01:19:08.200 --> 01:19:09.420]
Concent touched with these people

[01:19:09.420 --> 01:19:09.780]
And I called

[01:19:09.780 --> 01:19:11.740]
In other words the people are my friends now

[01:19:11.740 --> 01:19:13.240]
Are people that I associate with

[01:19:13.240 --> 01:19:14.180]
And have been doing for

[01:19:14.180 --> 01:19:14.740]
You know

[01:19:14.740 --> 01:19:15.620]
Well however long

[01:19:15.620 --> 01:19:16.160]
Right

[01:19:17.080 --> 01:19:18.260]
But did you have friends

[01:19:18.260 --> 01:19:19.320]
When you were friends with somebody in school

[01:19:19.320 --> 01:19:20.100]
50 years ago

[01:19:20.100 --> 01:19:21.160]
Doesn't mean you call them your friends

[01:19:21.160 --> 01:19:22.280]
Unless you've kept in touch

[01:19:22.280 --> 01:19:22.940]
Not necessarily

[01:19:22.940 --> 01:19:23.820]
Then you fuck

[01:19:23.820 --> 01:19:24.260]
What

[01:19:24.260 --> 01:19:26.000]
If they were your friends then

[01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:27.220]
And you had some good times

[01:19:27.220 --> 01:19:28.580]
And maybe you'd like to see them again

[01:19:28.580 --> 01:19:29.120]
Then you go

[01:19:29.120 --> 01:19:30.500]
Otherwise then you don't

[01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:32.380]
I wish I'd have had some

[01:19:32.380 --> 01:19:32.920]
Real simple

[01:19:32.920 --> 01:19:33.540]
But I didn't

[01:19:33.540 --> 01:19:34.480]
Well then don't

[01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:35.100]
What's the point

[01:19:36.180 --> 01:19:36.540]
Exactly

[01:19:37.320 --> 01:19:38.080]
I don't know

[01:19:38.080 --> 01:19:39.040]
It might be fascinating

[01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:39.880]
I had some friends

[01:19:39.880 --> 01:19:40.600]
That I would definitely

[01:19:40.600 --> 01:19:41.500]
If you know from high school

[01:19:41.500 --> 01:19:42.520]
Definitely like to see again

[01:19:42.520 --> 01:19:43.180]
There were good people

[01:19:43.180 --> 01:19:43.840]
I'd like to see you

[01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:44.420]
I'd like to see you

[01:19:44.420 --> 01:19:45.180]
Right over to Rochester

[01:19:45.180 --> 01:19:46.120]
And rent a car

[01:19:46.120 --> 01:19:46.780]
And drive to Canada

[01:19:46.780 --> 01:19:47.200]
They were

[01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:49.060]
Which the school

[01:19:49.060 --> 01:19:50.500]
By the way isn't even the same school

[01:19:50.500 --> 01:19:51.780]
They read both the school

[01:19:51.780 --> 01:19:52.600]
And different locations

[01:19:52.600 --> 01:19:53.680]
Not even the same building

[01:19:53.680 --> 01:19:54.840]
I don't know what that building is

[01:19:54.840 --> 01:19:55.200]
No more

[01:19:57.420 --> 01:19:59.020]
I mean I have been back there

[01:19:59.020 --> 01:20:00.260]
Once or twice in the inner

[01:20:00.260 --> 01:20:00.580]
You know

[01:20:00.580 --> 01:20:01.260]
Intervening time

[01:20:01.260 --> 01:20:02.200]
I don't ask me why

[01:20:02.200 --> 01:20:02.880]
I have no idea

[01:20:02.880 --> 01:20:03.560]
Okay I don't know

[01:20:03.560 --> 01:20:03.960]
I don't know

[01:20:05.060 --> 01:20:06.300]
Didn't just have a curiosity

[01:20:06.300 --> 01:20:07.420]
And you drive by the house

[01:20:07.420 --> 01:20:07.960]
Where you live

[01:20:07.960 --> 01:20:09.140]
And then the other house

[01:20:09.140 --> 01:20:09.600]
Where you live

[01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:09.940]
You know

[01:20:11.540 --> 01:20:12.280]
And you see

[01:20:13.240 --> 01:20:14.500]
It doesn't mean anything

[01:20:16.640 --> 01:20:18.280]
Even when I was in elementary school

[01:20:18.280 --> 01:20:19.280]
I've been back to Rochester

[01:20:19.280 --> 01:20:20.100]
And in Brighton

[01:20:20.100 --> 01:20:20.940]
And driven by the house

[01:20:20.940 --> 01:20:21.660]
123

[01:20:21.660 --> 01:20:22.200]
Varina

[01:20:22.200 --> 01:20:22.920]
Driving to Rochester

[01:20:22.920 --> 01:20:23.920]
I drove by the house

[01:20:24.920 --> 01:20:25.740]
And it was painted

[01:20:25.740 --> 01:20:26.420]
Different color

[01:20:26.420 --> 01:20:27.060]
And it was like

[01:20:27.060 --> 01:20:27.760]
You know

[01:20:27.760 --> 01:20:28.300]
And well

[01:20:28.300 --> 01:20:29.460]
What was the deal

[01:20:29.460 --> 01:20:30.520]
What did I do that for

[01:20:30.520 --> 01:20:30.920]
You know

[01:20:30.920 --> 01:20:31.920]
You can't live in the past

[01:20:31.920 --> 01:20:32.660]
I don't know

[01:20:32.660 --> 01:20:33.340]
Yeah

[01:20:33.340 --> 01:20:34.020]
For fun

[01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:36.060]
There wasn't any fun

[01:20:36.060 --> 01:20:36.500]
It was just

[01:20:36.500 --> 01:20:36.920]
It was just

[01:20:36.920 --> 01:20:37.480]
It was just like

[01:20:37.840 --> 01:20:38.860]
Yeah and then I drove

[01:20:38.860 --> 01:20:39.620]
Where the

[01:20:39.620 --> 01:20:40.820]
And the house where I was born

[01:20:42.360 --> 01:20:43.200]
In that neighborhood

[01:20:43.200 --> 01:20:43.760]
And there is

[01:20:43.760 --> 01:20:45.200]
There are no white people there anymore

[01:20:46.640 --> 01:20:47.000]
Not

[01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:48.260]
Nothing is anything wrong with that

[01:20:48.260 --> 01:20:48.640]
I don't want

[01:20:48.640 --> 01:20:49.700]
I don't want both camper

[01:20:49.700 --> 01:20:50.380]
Coming on the staff

[01:20:50.380 --> 01:20:50.880]
Noonsat

[01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:52.380]
Called somebody a cune on the air today

[01:20:52.380 --> 01:20:52.780]
You know

[01:20:53.700 --> 01:20:54.640]
I don't need that

[01:20:55.600 --> 01:20:56.500]
Till that episode

[01:20:56.500 --> 01:20:56.840]
I never

[01:20:56.840 --> 01:20:57.660]
Never realized what

[01:20:57.660 --> 01:20:58.880]
What a moron he is

[01:20:58.880 --> 01:21:00.220]
But then when you do

[01:21:00.220 --> 01:21:00.980]
With guys that played

[01:21:00.980 --> 01:21:01.860]
A Gerald Ford

[01:21:01.860 --> 01:21:03.240]
Played too much football without a helmet

[01:21:03.780 --> 01:21:04.580]
What do you expect

[01:21:08.360 --> 01:21:09.560]
Right what do you expect

[01:21:09.560 --> 01:21:10.000]
Nothing

[01:21:10.500 --> 01:21:11.900]
And he's going to be on the power

[01:21:11.900 --> 01:21:13.320]
Hour with the mad dog this afternoon

[01:21:13.320 --> 01:21:14.260]
Between four and five

[01:21:14.260 --> 01:21:15.220]
Because the hoppers on vacation

[01:21:15.220 --> 01:21:17.040]
And then bow and the big O

[01:21:17.040 --> 01:21:18.020]
Bow and O

[01:21:18.020 --> 01:21:19.980]
Eft often camp between five and six three

[01:21:19.980 --> 01:21:20.600]
Walks off

[01:21:20.600 --> 01:21:21.940]
Because we're obsessed with it

[01:21:21.940 --> 01:21:22.760]
Often is not that the

[01:21:22.760 --> 01:21:24.080]
Establishment of seasons underway

[01:21:24.480 --> 01:21:25.820]
And they're one for one baby

[01:21:25.820 --> 01:21:26.580]
They pulled out that

[01:21:26.580 --> 01:21:28.340]
They pulled that game out of their arse

[01:21:28.340 --> 01:21:28.920]
They're right at the

[01:21:28.920 --> 01:21:29.960]
Arse end of the game

[01:21:31.860 --> 01:21:33.240]
That cam cam and boy

[01:21:33.240 --> 01:21:35.160]
Goes for the two points and wins the game

[01:21:35.160 --> 01:21:36.100]
18 to 17

[01:21:36.100 --> 01:21:38.260]
And pulls victory from the jaws of the feet

[01:21:38.260 --> 01:21:39.860]
I bet you that was really impressive

[01:21:39.860 --> 01:21:40.280]
No

[01:21:40.280 --> 01:21:41.580]
Not not from what I read about

[01:21:41.580 --> 01:21:42.900]
I didn't see it because it wasn't you know

[01:21:43.460 --> 01:21:45.060]
It wasn't televised national

[01:21:46.480 --> 01:21:48.680]
But Chris wants to know if I did you watch the whole game

[01:21:48.680 --> 01:21:49.320]
No

[01:21:49.800 --> 01:21:50.460]
Why not

[01:21:51.600 --> 01:21:52.820]
Because it's preseason

[01:21:53.480 --> 01:21:55.220]
And nobody cares about exhibition game

[01:21:55.220 --> 01:21:57.500]
You know who the people are that care about exhibition games

[01:21:57.500 --> 01:21:58.100]
No

[01:21:59.260 --> 01:22:01.080]
People who go to practice

[01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:04.400]
I've talked about that before

[01:22:04.400 --> 01:22:05.900]
Like like the porkers the

[01:22:07.620 --> 01:22:10.460]
The the the broads that couldn't get laid in a pickle patch

[01:22:10.460 --> 01:22:12.060]
They go to watch practice

[01:22:12.640 --> 01:22:14.500]
Like in hockey game and hockey runs

[01:22:14.500 --> 01:22:15.560]
Practice make perfect

[01:22:15.560 --> 01:22:17.500]
And they press their nose up against the glass

[01:22:17.500 --> 01:22:18.680]
Like Petunia pig you know

[01:22:19.220 --> 01:22:19.920]
Like uh

[01:22:19.920 --> 01:22:20.760]
Yeah

[01:22:21.540 --> 01:22:22.840]
To try to get a sniff

[01:22:22.840 --> 01:22:24.740]
Yeah, if only it was just the girls doing that

[01:22:25.960 --> 01:22:27.160]
Ha ha ha ha ha

[01:22:27.160 --> 01:22:29.120]
Why does it instead of our entire staff

[01:22:29.120 --> 01:22:30.260]
Oh well yeah

[01:22:30.260 --> 01:22:32.140]
Well there's a bunch of girls like Clarence

[01:22:32.140 --> 01:22:32.920]
That's a girl for you

[01:22:32.920 --> 01:22:33.660]
And the beast

[01:22:34.320 --> 01:22:36.900]
How's his marriage doing by the way the beast is doing

[01:22:37.340 --> 01:22:40.460]

871 votes on the floor were going to be closing on 900 by noon

[01:22:49.140 --> 01:22:50.380]
Which means we got two hours

[01:22:50.380 --> 01:22:53.160]
The thousand I think I think it's a gimmick as they say

[01:22:53.160 --> 01:22:55.120]
So Resurra was dead by the way in case you missed the

The scooters dead

[01:22:57.280 --> 01:23:00.700]
I think the wrong scooter died you know who should have died

[01:23:00.700 --> 01:23:02.200]
Scooter Libby should have died right

[01:23:02.720 --> 01:23:05.620]
Right don't you think that God maybe had bad aim or something

[01:23:05.620 --> 01:23:08.220]
Oh you better get scooter today okay because the bush

[01:23:08.220 --> 01:23:11.520]
Game of pardon and so God zapped his magic finger

[01:23:12.240 --> 01:23:15.220]
And they killed the wrong scooter he's always screwing up like that

[01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:17.140]
God dang it

[01:23:17.800 --> 01:23:19.160]

[01:25:18.420 --> 01:25:22.680]
And he he was bragging in one interview about the fact that well he wasn't gonna change anything

[01:25:22.680 --> 01:25:27.160]
He was still eating all the same crap and he was smoking like like a like a chimney

[01:25:28.080 --> 01:25:31.660]
He was chain-smoking baby, but wouldn't you think that I don't know

[01:25:32.600 --> 01:25:36.880]
I always I always feel like a good scared does a lot of good for you, but not in his case and how he's dead

[01:25:38.700 --> 01:25:45.380]
Lenny Bruce 16 Milton Burle 12 how come Uncle Malthy's only got 12 that's bad. That's got to be a generational thing, doesn't it?

[01:25:46.300 --> 01:25:51.760]

Well I know my sister all my life

[01:26:23.420 --> 01:26:25.740]
That is why she's now my wife

[01:26:27.080 --> 01:26:29.520]
And I think my son may know it's true

[01:26:30.980 --> 01:26:32.900]
He's my nephew too

[01:26:35.140 --> 01:26:39.380]
Well my daddy is my uncle Joe my mother is my dear aunt

[01:26:39.380 --> 01:26:42.940]
Oh it is very plain to see my first cousin is me

[01:27:03.880 --> 01:27:04.280]
I

[01:27:04.280 --> 01:27:07.760]
Probably one at five sixty I don't think I will let that last note get on the year before really

[01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:12.180]
It was first. Yeah, no, no comment. Is it my second favorite one

[01:27:13.380 --> 01:27:19.180]
The tropical storm Dean emerged in the central Atlantic this morning good strength and it will major hurricane with the next five days

[01:27:19.180 --> 01:27:20.140]
Oh my god

[01:27:20.140 --> 01:27:22.080]
I don't want to get anybody nervous and jerky

[01:27:22.080 --> 01:27:24.020]
But it is that time of the year you know

[01:27:24.020 --> 01:27:26.380]
Another great reason not to be in South Florida

[01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:35.360]
At the same time forecasters suggested a projected path on a course that would put Puerto Rico his Spanola Cuba in South Florida more under the gun

[01:27:37.020 --> 01:27:41.300]
Under the current forecast the system would grow to a minimal hurricane Friday morning

[01:27:41.300 --> 01:27:48.520]
Cross over the northern lesser man tillies on Saturday morning and be at Puerto Rico's doorstep Sunday morning with winds of almost 110 miles an hour

[01:27:48.520 --> 01:27:50.940]
Which would be just shy of category three status

[01:27:51.960 --> 01:27:53.920]
However because the system still was almost

[01:27:53.920 --> 01:28:01.560]
1500 miles from lesser man tillies are about 2800 miles from Miami the predicted track would contain large errors the national hurricane center in day

[01:28:01.560 --> 01:28:05.300]
It said large errors big fat ones

[01:28:06.040 --> 01:28:10.620]
As 11 o'clock this morning Dean was walloping galloping it was walloping and galloping

[01:28:10.620 --> 01:28:14.680]
galloping wasted 23 miles an hour with sustained winds of 40 miles an hour

[01:28:15.400 --> 01:28:20.580]
It's tropical for his winds extended out of 35 miles from its center making it a relatively small system at this point

[01:28:20.580 --> 01:28:22.260]
However as it intensifies

[01:28:22.260 --> 01:28:25.780]
forecast is expected to expand considerably

[01:28:27.360 --> 01:28:32.820]
Hurricane specialist Lixion Avila of the hurricane center. What kind of an Amazon L.I. X. I. O. N. Lixion

[01:28:33.860 --> 01:28:36.060]
Lixion how do you pronounce X in Spanish?

[01:28:36.520 --> 01:28:38.020]
Uh like X

[01:28:39.320 --> 01:28:43.980]
Lixion sure no get out of here all right

[01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:51.380]
See there are names in Mexico for example. Let's start with X and it's always like like sh

[01:28:51.380 --> 01:28:52.960]
Well, then you'd have to ask a Mexican

[01:28:52.960 --> 01:28:54.400]
Okay, well

[01:28:55.460 --> 01:29:00.980]
Hurricane specialist Lixion Avila of the hurricane center said the system should continue moving the west for two to three days

[01:29:00.980 --> 01:29:05.200]
Your anti-Mexican bias man is really just it's just I don't know what you're talking about

[01:29:05.680 --> 01:29:11.880]
After that he said the forecast becomes highly uncertain because it's unknown how Dean will interact with a ridge of high pressure north of it

[01:29:11.880 --> 01:29:16.740]
Pressure if the ridge remains strong as some of models indicated would keep this term moving more to the west

[01:29:16.740 --> 01:29:20.880]
toward the Caribbean or Caribbean depending on how you say it. I don't say it at all

[01:29:20.880 --> 01:29:26.160]
Other models show a weaker ridge sustaining resulting in a gradual turn to the west northwest the next forecast

[01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:30.440]
Will be at five this afternoon. I'm sure we'll be all over that like stick on the Greg here at QA

[01:29:31.220 --> 01:29:32.280]
won't we not

[01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:35.200]
And you want to know why why?

[01:29:36.240 --> 01:29:42.900]
Hurricane well, I mean hurricanes we understand University Miami what that has but what is this hurricane or possible hurricane?

[01:29:43.600 --> 01:29:45.220]
Have to do with right

[01:29:47.220 --> 01:29:48.740]
I mean it blows

[01:29:49.780 --> 01:29:51.100]
But other than that

[01:29:53.100 --> 01:29:54.420]
How are we doing on this pool?

[01:29:55.360 --> 01:29:55.900]
892

[01:29:57.880 --> 01:30:03.360]
Before we even do the next break will have over 900. I mean is there any doubt at all and that's because they don't want to hear Ethan's school

[01:30:03.360 --> 01:30:09.140]
Nick they definitely don't want to hear Alex Marvez or Mike Burrino or Dave Runden Hyde or any of these losers

[01:30:09.140 --> 01:30:13.000]
They don't want to hear him. They don't want to hear Eddie the Pope. They don't want to hear Barry the jackass

[01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:16.880]
They don't want to hear these people no more don't you understand it clearance?

[01:30:16.900 --> 01:30:17.800]
It's no more

[01:30:20.100 --> 01:30:21.340]
I'm surprised last because

[01:30:22.440 --> 01:30:25.280]
Oh, yeah, isn't this cute. How about Sammy Davis junior for your pool?

[01:30:26.620 --> 01:30:31.300]
Right, can we have a meeting about that? Can we have a panel discussion about it? I think he passes

[01:30:32.260 --> 01:30:32.880]
He did

[01:30:33.760 --> 01:30:34.160]
Gas

[01:30:34.900 --> 01:30:35.300]
Away

[01:30:35.300 --> 01:30:42.300]
He passed away. He's dead. Sammy Davis is dead till risotto is dead. Merve Griffin is dead. What kind of a world is this anyway?

[01:30:43.560 --> 01:30:44.720]
Sammy Davis, Jr

[01:30:45.800 --> 01:30:47.360]
You want to put him on their crystal? What?

[01:30:48.660 --> 01:30:53.220]
Okay, it was joy. Why do you say it like that? Why can't you know? Okay

[01:30:56.580 --> 01:30:56.940]
I

[01:30:56.940 --> 01:31:00.940]
Try different ways to see what's on the back. Try different ways. Santa. You want to put him on there? Okay

[01:31:02.920 --> 01:31:04.960]
Thanks Kim. Oh

[01:31:04.960 --> 01:31:10.500]
My god. Oh, Mattel issues a newbie called toys produced in China and the best part of this whole deal is

[01:31:11.160 --> 01:31:15.380]
If it's from China, it'll kill you. That's right. The Chinese are I don't want to say them

[01:31:15.380 --> 01:31:17.740]
I'll talk about the Chinese people because there's so many of them now

[01:31:18.620 --> 01:31:21.320]
And there's so many of them here holy cow

[01:31:22.140 --> 01:31:26.380]
I didn't tell a story about the bag lady wing the $100,000 jackpot of wheels out of the air now

[01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:30.000]
I told you that before the show. Yeah, she's like a bag lady

[01:31:30.840 --> 01:31:36.440]
I'm sitting there that it's old bag dressed dressed like she just came out of a dumpster like a homeless person

[01:31:36.440 --> 01:31:39.160]
And she's wandering around looking for an open machine

[01:31:39.600 --> 01:31:44.880]
And I didn't pay too much attention because you know who might have talked and like five minutes later

[01:31:44.880 --> 01:31:48.800]
I hear a lot of screaming and yelling and one of the regulars comes over and snatched me on the back

[01:31:48.800 --> 01:31:51.060]
Which I don't don't touch me again and

[01:31:51.640 --> 01:31:58.000]
100,000 down there on number six. Well, okay, sure enough. She put a $20 bill in she didn't have any idea what she was doing

[01:31:58.000 --> 01:31:59.360]
What she won? What was going on?

[01:32:00.180 --> 01:32:04.260]
Three wheel of fortune things came up and she won a hundred grand bitch

[01:32:04.260 --> 01:32:11.300]
And right away all the regulars are like come back. So except me. I just set their plan on my sheen mon hoping for the best

[01:32:11.300 --> 01:32:16.460]
They're oh, geez the regulars never win the jackpots. It's always somebody like that that comes it off the street

[01:32:16.460 --> 01:32:17.660]
Well, you know like too bad

[01:32:19.680 --> 01:32:24.060]
There's nothing worse than sour grapes, you know, and my right isn't that sour grapes? Sure is

[01:32:24.540 --> 01:32:28.140]
Sure, I would like to have one and I would like to have my machine with the jackpots 166

[01:32:28.140 --> 01:32:32.340]
I would like to have those three wheel of fortunes come up and win it better some bag lady than some rich

[01:32:32.340 --> 01:32:37.700]
After that already has too much that's right. That's a good point or sour one of the regulars who's a real a hole and believe me

[01:32:37.700 --> 01:32:38.920]
There are many of them

[01:32:41.400 --> 01:32:46.400]
Including this old Indian guy with a bad hair piece and the smelly armpits

[01:32:47.020 --> 01:32:52.720]
Anyway, Mattel the world's largest toy company announced today at second major recall in a month or Chinese made toys

[01:32:52.720 --> 01:32:58.140]
Contaminated with lead paint at the same time and recall oh here's must be uh, yeah

[01:32:58.780 --> 01:33:00.860]
Hotels dot com go to hell

[01:33:01.820 --> 01:33:05.940]
At the same time we call millions about the choice from other sources who's small powerful magnets

[01:33:06.620 --> 01:33:14.020]
Small powerful maggots could come loose and be swallowed by children. You don't want your kids swallowing small powerful maggots

[01:33:14.820 --> 01:33:22.220]
The latest recalls our other major embarrassment for Mattel which began an ad campaign today in an effort to reassure consumers about its commitment to product safety

[01:33:22.220 --> 01:33:24.980]
They stand and in the earth times full-page ad

[01:33:26.400 --> 01:33:29.580]
And the ad said nothing is more important than the safety of our children

[01:33:30.260 --> 01:33:33.840]
Our long record of safety at Mattel is why we're one of the most trusted names with paratuses

[01:33:33.840 --> 01:33:39.920]
And I'm confident that the actions were taken. I'll maintain that trust at Robert Eckerd chief executive of Mattel while too bad

[01:33:39.920 --> 01:33:43.460]
You lose baby because more bad news from China

[01:33:45.360 --> 01:33:50.420]
The company in a statement issued from its headquarters in El Segundo, California said it was recalling a total of

[01:33:51.300 --> 01:33:59.080]
436,000 Chinese made toys more than half of the market in the US that had an impermecible levels of lead the toys

[01:33:59.700 --> 01:34:03.420]
Our die-canceling equals featuring the serge character from the movie cars

[01:34:04.340 --> 01:34:09.880]
Mattel said that effects in the products made between May and July were discovered as part of investigation of all of its

[01:34:09.880 --> 01:34:15.540]
Manufacturing and beginning July after receiving a tip about lead-based paint the latest move involves toys from a different Chinese

[01:34:15.540 --> 01:34:22.260]
Contractor than those involved after the initial recall or even this month don't you know don't brush your teeth with Chinese toothpaste

[01:34:23.620 --> 01:34:24.180]
right

[01:34:26.380 --> 01:34:28.820]
Don't be no one I don't want to say that

[01:34:29.560 --> 01:34:31.660]
Cat don't be no cat

[01:34:32.440 --> 01:34:33.160]
kitty cat

[01:34:35.180 --> 01:34:35.940]

The separate action today involved 18.2 million magnetic toys about half of them sold in the US expanded a recall

[01:34:43.160 --> 01:34:48.340]
Initiated last year after reports of deaths and injuries to kids who ingested magnets that had come loose

[01:34:48.340 --> 01:34:55.520]
Mattel said the recall covered 63 different toys all sold before January this year including 44 poly pocket toys

Why don't people want to go visit China? What is it to see there? Do you want to go there?

[01:35:26.920 --> 01:35:28.640]
I don't know my best friend just went over there

[01:35:28.640 --> 01:35:31.800]

Yeah, he keeps talking me into wanting to go or trying to talk me into going I said I don't want to go to China

[01:35:48.240 --> 01:35:54.880]
I don't want any other places you must see before you go to China. Yeah, like every other except for Mexico of course

[01:35:58.680 --> 01:35:59.000]
Yeah

[01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:03.680]
Well, why would you say that? I don't want to go to Mexico. Go to you know well, then

[01:36:06.880 --> 01:36:10.300]
Mainly because when I go somewhere I like to come back alive. That's a good start

said in April shortly after Jacques was captured he then returned to New York

after being caught trying to sneak into the US from British Columbia on

[01:40:30.200 --> 01:40:35.140]
Canada's West Coast a O'Connell said that Jacques spent most of his time as a

[01:40:35.140 --> 01:40:37.960]
fugitive in Malaysia she told the court that investigators knew he was in

[01:40:37.960 --> 01:40:41.060]
Malaysia because he frequently uses email account they were able to track him

[01:40:41.060 --> 01:40:45.420]
down the charges against Jacques a former Episcopate in Priests were related

[01:40:45.420 --> 01:40:48.300]
to why he admittedly performed on Robert Lewis Stevenson school student

[01:40:48.300 --> 01:40:53.060]
October 20th 2005 O'Connell said the boy told a teacher what was going on and

[01:40:53.060 --> 01:40:56.120]
the teacher followed them from the school in the park the teacher lost them in

[01:40:56.120 --> 01:40:59.360]
the park didn't see the sexual activity but back at the school he alerted the

[01:40:59.360 --> 01:41:06.280]
headmaster when Jacques Richard and the teacher in the headmaster confronted him

[01:45:12.090 --> 01:45:16.110]

[01:45:16.110 --> 01:45:23.030]

and very good column here George W. Bush this is your life he says congratulations

[01:45:28.350 --> 01:45:31.670]
to you president Bush you may not realize this but you and vice president

[01:45:31.670 --> 01:45:36.510]
rabid dog Cheney have turned your citizens against their own country most

[01:45:36.510 --> 01:45:40.050]
Americans are coming contact with through my writing I believe the U.S. is a

[01:45:40.050 --> 01:45:43.430]
predatory nation that kills human beings indiscriminately takes whatever it

[01:45:43.430 --> 01:45:47.010]
wants when it wants it don't believe me just like it's some of my writing in last

[01:45:47.010 --> 01:45:50.470]
few weeks there are people that feel this nation is too far over the

[01:45:50.470 --> 01:45:54.390]
break to ever be brought back to a decent republic they feel shame over

[01:45:54.390 --> 01:45:57.190]
everything that's happened not only on your watch even though that started

[01:45:57.190 --> 01:46:00.070]
but now they've looked at the nation with a critical eye and they don't really

[01:46:00.070 --> 01:46:03.210]
believe that this nation's ever stood for anything worthwhile I know this isn't

[01:46:03.210 --> 01:46:06.670]
true the U.S. has done some noble things in its history what you are seeing

[01:46:06.670 --> 01:46:11.290]
Bush baby is something called malaise so just so you know what I'm talking

[01:46:11.290 --> 01:46:14.030]
about I'll give you the definition I know you weren't that smart and then it's

[01:46:14.030 --> 01:46:17.110]
got the dictionary definition and indefinite feeling of debility or lack of

[01:46:17.110 --> 01:46:20.750]
health often indicative of it accompanying the onset of an illness or a big

[01:46:20.750 --> 01:46:25.510]
sense of middle or moral ill being a malaise of cynicism and despair why do they

[01:46:25.510 --> 01:46:28.330]
have this condition I don't think you have very far to go to see what's

[01:46:28.330 --> 01:46:31.650]
caused it look in the mirror call Dick Cheney and Rice and Gates and listen to

[01:46:31.650 --> 01:46:34.550]
their world view as if you weren't the president but a spectator from middle

[01:46:34.550 --> 01:46:38.570]
America push yourself in the place that someone who has a hard time meeting their

[01:46:38.570 --> 01:46:41.430]
red or mortgage payment or an old lady that lost their life savings to the

[01:46:41.430 --> 01:46:45.050]
in-run scandal or do a young woman that lost her husband to an IED or maybe

[01:46:45.050 --> 01:46:47.850]
someone who thought they could get this country on the right track but now sees

[01:46:47.850 --> 01:46:50.710]
that it's a herculean task because all the cards are stacked in the

[01:46:50.710 --> 01:46:53.650]
government's favor well that's another word you probably have a hard time

[01:46:53.650 --> 01:46:58.250]
with it's called empathy what you have none you won't see this malaise in the

[01:46:58.250 --> 01:47:01.190]
eyes of the people you need you too busy slapping each other on the back

[01:47:01.190 --> 01:47:04.230]
and telling each other what a great job they've done most of them are making

[01:47:04.230 --> 01:47:07.510]
money hand over fist and don't have a cure in the world you surround yourself

[01:47:07.510 --> 01:47:09.930]
with these people they don't see what they've done with the spirit of the

[01:47:09.930 --> 01:47:13.190]
people in this once-proud nation they're in denial remember when you were

[01:47:13.190 --> 01:47:16.370]
drinking and snorkeling coke and chasing Mexican girls in Texas and your

[01:47:16.370 --> 01:47:19.490]
parents told you that you had a problem you didn't believe them that's what

[01:47:19.490 --> 01:47:23.490]
denial is once you've done it you can't see clearly at all it's a system of

[01:47:23.490 --> 01:47:27.170]
beliefs that don't allow you to see reality just as well if you saw I mean

[01:47:27.170 --> 01:47:29.970]
really saw what you've done this country you put a bullet in your mouth like

[01:47:29.970 --> 01:47:33.810]
Hitler did yeah you're that bad the trouble with all of this is that often after

[01:47:33.810 --> 01:47:36.790]
most people get over their malaise they get angry a lot like I am right

[01:47:36.790 --> 01:47:41.530]
Timothy once they get really angry there isn't much you can do after that the

[01:47:41.530 --> 01:47:44.070]
thing is after they shake the feelings off they really don't care what happens

[01:47:44.070 --> 01:47:47.530]
as long as they don't have to go back to the feeling the way they did before

[01:47:48.290 --> 01:47:51.850]
some of them will die before they get that hopeless feeling again I know that's

[01:47:51.850 --> 01:47:55.610]
where I am it only takes one spark to set them off then someone from their

[01:47:55.610 --> 01:47:58.530]
family away from their family for writing against the things America is doing

[01:48:00.170 --> 01:48:03.470]
let me try that sentence again take someone away from their family for writing

[01:48:03.470 --> 01:48:06.590]
against the things America is doing start your war against Iran that we know

[01:48:06.590 --> 01:48:09.770]
you're planning let the rest of your cronies put everyone on part time so they

[01:48:09.770 --> 01:48:12.830]
don't have to pay their workers benefits and watch this nation come to a boil

[01:48:13.390 --> 01:48:16.190]
Howard's in is wrong if you're going by what he writes you must feel pretty

[01:48:16.190 --> 01:48:19.710]
comfortable he's practically given up on the human race you have to deal with

[01:48:19.710 --> 01:48:22.690]
people like me I told you generals to go to hell and I'm still here there

[01:48:22.690 --> 01:48:26.090]
others around like me too people that haven't given up in this country people

[01:48:26.090 --> 01:48:29.430]
that still believe that this country is of the people and for the people so

[01:48:29.430 --> 01:48:32.070]
while you're sitting back and joining this good life remember that there are

[01:48:32.070 --> 01:48:34.730]
many in this country that don't wish you well there are many in this

[01:48:34.730 --> 01:48:38.830]
country that at this point are ashamed to be Americans that's sad that's where

[01:48:38.830 --> 01:48:42.050]
you've brought us to this place of hopelessness just remember this after

[01:48:42.050 --> 01:48:46.590]
the fresh and anger I hope you're ready for it says Timothy Gatto as in El

[01:49:06.790 --> 01:49:07.710]
the paper on a toilet.

[01:49:07.950 --> 01:49:13.650]

Hello.

[01:49:24.110 --> 01:49:24.310]
See?

[01:49:24.750 --> 01:49:25.330]
We're straight.

[01:49:25.710 --> 01:49:26.550]
That's a girl.

[01:49:27.290 --> 01:49:28.290]
Girls are okay.

[01:49:28.630 --> 01:49:32.970]
But I'd rather stare blankly ahead and just talk about sports, sports, sports, sports,

[01:49:32.970 --> 01:49:36.410]

[01:50:40.990 --> 01:50:40.990]

[01:50:40.990 --> 01:50:42.630]
We have 933 votes on the pool.

[01:50:42.830 --> 01:50:43.970]
We're not far away now, Chris.

[01:50:44.230 --> 01:50:47.210]
When that moment comes when we get the 1000 votes, I'm bailing out of here.

[01:50:47.310 --> 01:50:47.830]
I'm going to launch.

[01:50:49.170 --> 01:50:50.030]
I just had my own trap.

[01:50:50.350 --> 01:50:51.650]
Two slices of swish cheese.

[01:50:51.790 --> 01:50:52.150]
No carbs.

[01:50:53.130 --> 01:50:53.350]
Good.

[01:50:53.970 --> 01:50:54.470]
Is that okay?

[01:50:54.830 --> 01:50:55.030]
It's not.

[01:50:55.150 --> 01:50:55.970]
It's not crap either.

[01:50:56.670 --> 01:50:57.290]
Even better.

[01:50:59.670 --> 01:51:04.070]
One thing about you, man, when you turn on a company or on people or on whatever.

[01:51:04.490 --> 01:51:04.770]
That's right.

[01:51:04.770 --> 01:51:05.750]
I don't believe in forgiveness.

[01:51:05.870 --> 01:51:07.490]
You have Mexicans, a man who was a bad day for them.

[01:51:07.550 --> 01:51:08.550]
I never turned on the Mexicans.

[01:51:09.810 --> 01:51:15.350]
A former state legislature chaplain who ran for the Assembly last year in New York State.

[01:51:16.370 --> 01:51:20.090]
As admitted to sexually abusing four underage boys while serving as a rector,

[01:51:20.790 --> 01:51:21.410]
Al Ryd!

[01:51:21.730 --> 01:51:23.870]
Let them of a Central New York church.

[01:51:25.070 --> 01:51:27.450]
Officials with the Episcopal Ices of Central New York say,

[01:51:27.530 --> 01:51:31.810]
J. Edward Putnam 66, recently admitted in a written statement to the bishop that he engaged

[01:51:31.810 --> 01:51:36.230]
in inappropriate conduct with minors while at St. James' Episcopal Church in Skini Atlas.

[01:51:36.910 --> 01:51:38.610]
Do you ever hear of Skini Atlas in New York?

[01:51:38.970 --> 01:51:39.130]
No.

[01:51:39.510 --> 01:51:40.090]
You did now.

[01:51:41.990 --> 01:51:47.270]
An investigation began and may result in his being suspended last month from acting as a priest for 20 years.

[01:51:47.770 --> 01:51:55.570]
The Ices official state Putnam was ordained in 1970, admitted to sexually abusing the boys from early 1985 to mid-1980 and 93, eight years.

[01:51:56.190 --> 01:51:58.630]
He served as chaplain of the Assembly from 94 and 96.

[01:51:58.630 --> 01:52:03.630]
Last year he ran unsuccessfully for the Assembly itself and he got whiffed.

[01:52:06.210 --> 01:52:06.730]
A father?

[01:52:06.990 --> 01:52:07.910]
You're fair with me.

[01:52:08.170 --> 01:52:11.010]
Anyway, remember the story about the old lady in the Japan Accroate?

[01:52:11.630 --> 01:52:11.930]
Yes.

[01:52:12.750 --> 01:52:17.330]
Well, according to Guinness Book of World Records, Edna Parker, 114 of Shelbyville, Indiana,

[01:52:17.910 --> 01:52:23.110]
is now the world's oldest person actor, Yoni Minigau of Japan died yesterday.

[01:52:24.690 --> 01:52:25.730]
Edna's 114.

[01:52:25.730 --> 01:52:28.330]
Parker was born on April 20, 1989.

[01:52:28.610 --> 01:52:32.290]
I see I keep doing that because I can't relate to anybody who was born in 1880.

[01:52:32.830 --> 01:52:33.530]
Still alive.

[01:52:34.590 --> 01:52:40.630]
April 20, 1983, she lives at the Heritage House Convalescent Center, about 25 miles southeast of Indianapolis.

[01:52:40.810 --> 01:52:44.690]
She was born in Morgan County growing up on a farm before becoming a teacher.

[01:52:46.350 --> 01:52:53.450]
She taught in the two-room school in Smythland in Indiana for several years till she went to travel with sweetheart and next to her neighbor, Earl Parker, in 1911.

[01:52:54.270 --> 01:52:56.910]
The same year she graduated from Franklin College.

[01:52:57.510 --> 01:52:59.890]
Parker had two sons, both of whom she is outlived.

[01:53:00.030 --> 01:53:01.530]
Her husband died in 1938.

[01:53:02.090 --> 01:53:04.130]
Sixty-seven years ago her husband croaked.

[01:53:05.490 --> 01:53:06.430]
Now, incredible or what?

[01:53:06.630 --> 01:53:07.490]
Sixty-nine years ago.

[01:53:07.950 --> 01:53:10.810]
At just five feet tall and seventy pounds, Parker is still able to walk.

[01:53:11.130 --> 01:53:13.190]
She's in good health and enjoys me setting poetry.

[01:53:14.910 --> 01:53:16.210]
Is that incredible or what?

[01:53:16.330 --> 01:53:16.730]
Jolly good.

[01:53:17.250 --> 01:53:21.790]
Minigau who raised four sons and daughter on her own by peddling flowers and vegetables died one day afternoon.

[01:53:23.130 --> 01:53:25.310]
Well, I already went through the stair about that old bag.

[01:53:25.430 --> 01:53:26.970]
We don't want to rehash that, do we?

[01:53:27.910 --> 01:53:28.030]
No.

[01:53:28.650 --> 01:53:29.290]
We don't?

[01:53:29.430 --> 01:53:29.610]
No.

[01:53:30.850 --> 01:53:31.570]
Why not?

[01:53:32.090 --> 01:53:33.450]
Kill some precious time, baby.

[01:53:34.110 --> 01:53:36.990]
Now, let me ask you about the calls because I haven't taken one today. How are your calls back?

[01:53:37.610 --> 01:53:38.150]
You know.

[01:53:39.290 --> 01:53:40.050]
Really good, huh?

[01:53:41.050 --> 01:53:41.410]
Spectacular.

[01:53:41.570 --> 01:53:45.410]
Oh, when they're coming in, they're all right, but then they don't.

[01:53:46.630 --> 01:53:47.450]
They don't come in?

[01:53:47.650 --> 01:53:47.810]
Right.

[01:53:48.370 --> 01:53:48.530]
Good.

[01:53:49.230 --> 01:53:51.270]
And I have a 36 votes on the pool.

[01:53:52.450 --> 01:53:53.970]
Favorite Jewish community of all time.

[01:53:54.110 --> 01:53:58.250]
I may read the whole list because I don't want to reread the stair about that hundred and fourteen year old Japanese woman.

[01:53:58.370 --> 01:53:59.830]
I croaked.

[01:54:00.870 --> 01:54:03.410]

Curly Howard 53, Don Rickles 43.

[01:54:11.570 --> 01:54:13.370]
Now, why is Curly getting more votes than Moe?

[01:54:13.590 --> 01:54:14.610]
Maybe they don't like Moe.

[01:54:14.610 --> 01:54:15.750]
Don't they don't like Moe?

[01:54:16.890 --> 01:54:18.150]
Who did you like best?

[01:54:19.590 --> 01:54:21.650]
I liked Curly, but you know, don't make me choose.

[01:54:21.650 --> 01:54:24.250]
You know, Larry nobody ever talked about Larry's.

[01:54:25.030 --> 01:54:27.050]
Don't make you choose to this a tough decision.

[01:54:27.470 --> 01:54:28.950]
I always like Larry. He had the best lines.

[01:54:29.330 --> 01:54:29.970]
I see.

[01:54:30.470 --> 01:54:31.250]

[01:54:54.590 --> 01:54:57.150]
The co-creator of Signfelt. He has his own show now called.

[01:54:57.250 --> 01:54:57.970]
I'm so sorry.

[01:54:58.530 --> 01:54:59.390]
The Larry David show.

[01:54:59.570 --> 01:54:59.970]
There you go.

[01:55:00.430 --> 01:55:00.550]
Oh.

[01:55:01.010 --> 01:55:02.490]
Guilgarander 12, Milton Burrell 12.

[01:55:02.650 --> 01:55:04.150]
Uncle Malthy's only got a dozen.

[01:55:05.690 --> 01:55:07.370]
Don't you think that's got to be an age thing?

[01:55:08.310 --> 01:55:09.530]
A generational thing?

[01:55:10.990 --> 01:55:12.610]
He was Mr. Television, baby.

[01:55:12.750 --> 01:55:13.790]
He was like a...

[01:55:13.790 --> 01:55:14.450]
It's an age thing.

[01:55:15.050 --> 01:55:15.790]
It's an age thing.

[01:55:15.930 --> 01:55:18.950]
All the people of like Milton Burrell are dead except me.

[01:55:19.630 --> 01:55:20.890]
And Jerry Stiller 9, what?

[01:55:21.830 --> 01:55:22.450]
And Chicken Knight.

[01:55:23.630 --> 01:55:24.550]
And then Chicken Knight.

[01:55:24.670 --> 01:55:25.590]
He's alive too, barely.

[01:55:25.970 --> 01:55:27.590]

[01:55:27.690 --> 01:55:28.370]
Is he, I haven't heard any...

[01:55:28.930 --> 01:55:29.970]
No, no, I haven't either.

[01:55:30.850 --> 01:55:32.910]
I don't why owe him any money at this point or not.

[01:55:33.110 --> 01:55:33.270]
No.

[01:55:34.470 --> 01:55:35.450]
Not for a while yet.

[01:55:35.450 --> 01:55:37.830]
But I'm sure that when I do, I'll be hearing about it.

[01:55:37.890 --> 01:55:39.910]
Where of exploding balls?

[01:55:42.850 --> 01:55:43.570]

But for you, that man's why they go black and...

[01:55:54.910 --> 01:55:55.870]
Some of the fastest.

Read a book.

[01:56:00.130 --> 01:56:00.630]
Read a book.

[01:56:00.930 --> 01:56:01.410]
Read a month.

[01:56:02.150 --> 01:56:03.030]
Read a book.

[01:56:03.350 --> 01:56:03.810]
Read a book.

[01:56:04.130 --> 01:56:04.690]
Read a book.

[01:56:04.690 --> 01:56:04.690]

[01:56:04.890 --> 01:56:06.210]
Read a book.

[01:56:06.510 --> 01:56:07.010]
Read a book.

[01:56:07.450 --> 01:56:07.850]
Read a month.

[01:56:08.090 --> 01:56:08.630]
Read a book.

[01:56:09.750 --> 01:56:10.190]
Read a book.

[01:56:10.370 --> 01:56:10.370]

[01:56:10.630 --> 01:56:11.070]
Read a month.

[01:56:12.850 --> 01:56:14.970]
Reade, enb-o, outch!

[01:56:16.050 --> 01:56:18.190]
Reate, enb-o, outch!

[01:56:18.890 --> 01:56:21.950]
Reade, enb-o, outch, outch!

[01:56:21.950 --> 01:56:21.950]

[01:56:22.070 --> 01:56:24.570]
Reate, enb-o, outch!

[01:56:24.850 --> 01:56:25.990]
Keith's for Taylor.

[01:56:26.210 --> 01:56:27.190]
Now from confrontation.

[01:56:27.710 --> 01:56:30.750]
Oh, philosophical, why the book?

[01:56:54.330 --> 01:56:57.910]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[01:56:57.910 --> 01:57:27.890]
Johnny G

[01:57:36.550 --> 01:57:40.970]
So trick us, so trick us, so trick us

[01:57:40.970 --> 01:57:44.690]
Rock and lay, rock and lay, rock and lay

[01:57:44.690 --> 01:57:47.330]
Rock and lay, rock and lay, rock and lay

[01:57:47.330 --> 01:57:50.030]

[01:58:35.590 --> 01:58:35.590]

[01:58:35.590 --> 01:58:35.810]
GO.

[01:58:36.010 --> 01:58:36.190]
GO.

[01:58:36.190 --> 01:58:36.290]
GO.

[01:58:36.650 --> 01:58:36.650]

[01:58:36.870 --> 01:58:37.110]
GO.

[01:58:37.610 --> 01:58:37.850]
GO.

[01:58:38.270 --> 01:58:38.270]

[01:58:38.310 --> 01:58:38.310]

[01:58:38.710 --> 01:58:38.950]
GO.

[01:58:43.130 --> 01:58:43.570]
GO.

[01:58:48.730 --> 01:58:49.610]
Ramp 46.

[01:58:49.610 --> 01:58:51.490]
I sure hope you haven't been playing that thing now

[01:58:51.490 --> 01:58:52.890]
Because when I come on in crookedly,

[01:58:52.950 --> 01:58:54.870]
Old GBO, don't want to hear that anymore, yeah.

[01:58:54.890 --> 01:58:55.370]
There goes that, it's Christmas

[01:58:55.370 --> 01:58:56.290]
Play the A Yesterday.

[01:58:56.290 --> 01:58:57.170]
You did?

[01:58:57.530 --> 01:58:58.210]
One o'clock.

[01:58:58.910 --> 01:58:59.590]
Oh, why?

[01:59:00.030 --> 01:59:00.530]
Why not?

[01:59:01.350 --> 01:59:02.090]
That's a good idea.

[01:59:02.090 --> 01:59:02.850]
I agree with you.

[01:59:03.090 --> 01:59:03.410]
That's great.

[01:59:04.490 --> 01:59:05.750]
I'm not one of those people.

[01:59:05.830 --> 01:59:06.610]
It's easily the two of them.

[01:59:06.610 --> 01:59:07.550]
Those command performance.

[01:59:09.370 --> 01:59:11.390]
This is Chris and who is the other one?

[01:59:12.110 --> 01:59:12.290]
Miguel.

[01:59:12.290 --> 01:59:12.450]
I'm a girl.

[01:59:12.650 --> 01:59:13.110]
Some other people.

[01:59:13.250 --> 01:59:15.630]
Miguel always said, oh yeah, and then you saw what happened to Miguel, Chris.

[01:59:16.030 --> 01:59:17.370]
You better learn your lesson, okay?

[01:59:17.750 --> 01:59:17.830]
Okay.

[01:59:17.970 --> 01:59:17.970]

[01:59:17.970 --> 01:59:18.670]
I was bitching about.

[01:59:18.790 --> 01:59:20.990]
I'm playing that too much and look what happened to him.

[01:59:22.230 --> 01:59:24.230]
He got the old shiv right in the back.

[01:59:24.230 --> 01:59:25.790]
Shiv, that's SHIV.

[01:59:28.110 --> 01:59:29.510]
944 votes on the pool, man.

[01:59:29.630 --> 01:59:33.070]
We got that thousand, I think, I think, made in the shade.

[01:59:33.710 --> 01:59:35.450]
It was how I'm like back in a way a little bit.

[01:59:36.890 --> 01:59:37.250]
Yeah.

[01:59:37.830 --> 01:59:39.790]
Well, yeah, because we still need 56 more.

[01:59:39.910 --> 01:59:41.230]
I don't want these people to start getting complacent.

[01:59:42.170 --> 01:59:43.590]
We'll do it.

[01:59:47.190 --> 01:59:50.110]
Oh, man, you are just really something.

[01:59:52.090 --> 01:59:57.710]
Jim David, no relation to Howard, more Howard David, or Larry David, or Curly or Indos

[01:59:57.710 --> 02:00:00.390]
other David or Ted David from CNBC.

[02:00:01.550 --> 02:00:04.410]
I'm smoking chimp rights, the gay squirm factor.

[02:00:05.730 --> 02:00:10.830]
He says, while my favorite jokes are Jewish guys talking to a Gentile and says, nobody cares about the Jews anymore.

[02:00:11.230 --> 02:00:12.350]
Nobody cares about the Jews.

[02:00:12.710 --> 02:00:16.310]
Last night, I dreamed eight-elf Hitler killed six million Jews and two rodeo clowns.

[02:00:16.850 --> 02:00:19.850]
The Gentile says, why did he kill two rodeo clowns?

[02:00:19.930 --> 02:00:22.390]
The Jewish lady says, seeing nobody cares about the Jews.

[02:00:24.330 --> 02:00:27.690]
I just returned from Denmark and Sweden, where nobody cares about the Gays.

[02:00:28.450 --> 02:00:31.410]
In Denmark, gay marriage is legal and in Sweden might as well be.

[02:00:31.910 --> 02:00:33.830]
Most of Western Europe and Canada are the same.

[02:00:33.890 --> 02:00:36.670]
With full marriage, equality or at least equivalent rights.

[02:00:37.650 --> 02:00:40.170]
Straight people leave Gays alone and let them live their lives.

[02:00:41.050 --> 02:00:44.790]
And except for the requisite pockets of religious fanaticism, nobody cares.

[02:00:44.790 --> 02:00:50.070]
Either they're more enlightened, not poisoned by religion, or just drunk most of the time, but nobody cares about the Gays.

[02:00:50.610 --> 02:00:55.430]
Maybe because they're small countries, they don't have to deal with a lovely region known as the rest of the country.

[02:00:56.470 --> 02:01:00.910]
In America, the spectacle of uncomfortable straights, siptowing around gazes in full squirm.

[02:01:01.310 --> 02:01:06.470]
The HRC logo democratic forum showed the candidates, keenly trying, not to run screaming into the night.

[02:01:07.030 --> 02:01:12.710]
Hillary was at her pre-recorded best-righted just-of-ire husband's, crippling defensive marriage act, and don't ask, don't tell.

[02:01:12.710 --> 02:01:15.710]
Tool-os passed to a piece, said uncomfortable straights.

[02:01:16.330 --> 02:01:19.610]
Obama danced around the reasons why black churches are so anti-Gays.

[02:01:19.970 --> 02:01:22.850]
If he had just said, the brothers don't like the mows it would have been honest.

[02:01:24.250 --> 02:01:30.410]
Melissa Etheridge, dubbed by George Stepon Topovas as the new Ted Couple, helped on, in words, continuous gift of free publicity to Anne Colter,

[02:01:30.750 --> 02:01:35.770]
denied that he ever said he was uncomfortable around those people, and reassures that he's comfortable now and just as cute as ever.

[02:01:36.550 --> 02:01:42.690]
Then she asked Bill Richardson, who once used the word, Marry Cohn, on the Von Eimer show, if being gay was a choice.

[02:01:43.270 --> 02:01:49.430]
He sputtered, it's a choice before going into complete, holy effing, shmit, let me backfell mode.

[02:01:50.590 --> 02:01:51.490]
I had to be-

[02:01:51.490 --> 02:01:51.970]
As we come.

[02:01:52.150 --> 02:01:53.750]
Yeah, I had to be real cautious with that.

[02:01:54.110 --> 02:01:59.230]
He might as well have said, bear with me, the only reason I'm here is, so you not a Cohns will support me, I'm Latino for God's sake.

[02:02:00.430 --> 02:02:03.590]
The only way he weaseled out of it was to congratulate Melissa on her Oscar.

[02:02:05.250 --> 02:02:10.010]
Only Dennis Kirsten and Michael Rellen, Doris Merridge equality, easy to do when you don't have a chance in hell.

[02:02:10.010 --> 02:02:14.930]
The others gave convoluted answers, not having the nerve to say, look it would be okay with me kind of sort of,

[02:02:14.990 --> 02:02:16.790]
but there's no way I'm going to get elected if I support it.

[02:02:17.150 --> 02:02:20.910]
I'll pass the box so your mergers can vary from state to state, like cell phone service.

[02:02:22.530 --> 02:02:26.010]
Republicans might have agreed to the forum if it had been held in a giant closet.

[02:02:26.650 --> 02:02:29.270]
Matt Barber of Concerned Women for America went ballistic, writing,

[02:02:29.630 --> 02:02:37.750]
it's shameful that our nation's moral standards have no desire to the point when not considered good and tolerant old age debate organized entirely around the promotion of sexual immorality.

[02:02:38.610 --> 02:02:43.050]
The head of the CWA is Beverly Le He, wife of left behind author Tim Le He,

[02:02:43.190 --> 02:02:47.530]
their son Lee is by most accounts gay, one can only imagine the squirm factor in that office.

[02:02:48.430 --> 02:02:51.650]
The head of the younger Republicans was just got yanking a buddy in the dead of the night,

[02:02:51.930 --> 02:02:54.250]
and all traces of his existence were yanked from the website.

[02:02:55.510 --> 02:02:59.810]
Representative Bob Allen, Republican of Florida, offered an undercover cop $20 for all sex,

[02:03:00.230 --> 02:03:02.910]
and then squirmed out of it, blaming it on his fear of blacks in the park,

[02:03:03.230 --> 02:03:05.970]
so that's why I feel like doing somebody every time I walk through Harlem.

[02:03:07.110 --> 02:03:12.410]
The mayor of Fort Lauderdale, gay town, you were saying made enough anti-gay comments to force possible recall election,

[02:03:12.630 --> 02:03:16.050]
meanwhile the new Florida governor announced that he's gala everyone begs to differ.

[02:03:16.230 --> 02:03:17.010]
Gay, hey Charlie!

[02:03:17.190 --> 02:03:17.610]
You fairy!

[02:03:18.370 --> 02:03:26.230]
Sandy Ego Firefighter Screamin' Howard, because they had to be in the horrible gay pride parade and made people suggestive comments to them,

[02:03:26.510 --> 02:03:27.550]
what a bunch of faggot's.

[02:03:28.110 --> 02:03:30.370]
In entertainment, the screaming continues to pace.

[02:03:30.930 --> 02:03:36.070]
I now pronounce you Chuck and Larry South Park and little bush crank out every gay stereotype in the book for cheap yucks,

[02:03:36.190 --> 02:03:42.950]
and then make half ass statements about tolerance, not to mention the thought of Adam Sandler and Kevin James having sex, which makes gay squirm.

[02:03:43.670 --> 02:03:47.610]
While they're trying, but still too many people are just grossed out by it all and don't want to say it.

[02:03:47.910 --> 02:03:51.310]
It's enough to make you want to move to Scandinavia where nobody cares about the gays,

[02:03:51.650 --> 02:03:56.750]
if it wasn't just wasn't so freaking cold, and the American dollar was better and I wouldn't go broke having an entree.

[02:03:56.750 --> 02:03:58.050]
Says Jim David.

[02:04:00.550 --> 02:04:03.870]
One of my friends who just came back from Stockholm, he said it was wonderful.

[02:04:04.110 --> 02:04:04.910]
I was there years ago.

[02:04:06.330 --> 02:04:07.290]
Very expensive.

[02:04:08.410 --> 02:04:08.890]
Yeah.

[02:04:09.310 --> 02:04:10.890]
Unfriendly people, beautiful people.

[02:04:12.130 --> 02:04:13.650]
Unfriendly, cold, drunk.

[02:04:15.330 --> 02:04:16.470]
951 votes on the poll.

[02:04:16.630 --> 02:04:18.810]
We need 49 votes to get to that 1000.

[02:04:19.590 --> 02:04:25.250]
If you want to block all the South Florida sports writers from any future appearances on QA and if we get to 1000 votes today,

[02:04:25.250 --> 02:04:27.930]
then them if they have the audacity, you never show up again.

[02:04:28.330 --> 02:04:29.070]
You think they will?

[02:04:29.450 --> 02:04:29.610]
Yes.

[02:04:31.710 --> 02:04:37.570]
Even at Indian Alex Marvez, and even at Ethan Skolnick, it sounds like a ten-year-old school kid trying to be a blockcaster.

[02:04:38.710 --> 02:04:42.830]
Well, Kenny, let me tell you this. The dolphins really have a chance to see it. They got a shot, Kenny.

[02:04:46.490 --> 02:04:50.430]
And Kenny, just salivating over Alex Marvez.

[02:04:50.870 --> 02:04:53.470]
I mean, what does Alex Marvez look like, and either you've seen him?

[02:04:54.110 --> 02:04:56.010]
You've got a mullet. What else do you need to know?

[02:04:56.410 --> 02:04:56.570]
Yeah.

[02:04:58.630 --> 02:04:59.570]
What's his haircut like?

[02:05:02.530 --> 02:05:02.890]
Lackum.

[02:05:04.150 --> 02:05:04.510]
Yeah.

[02:05:07.150 --> 02:05:10.090]
Oh my god. Well, maybe Kenny's got a thing from Mullet, so I don't know.

[02:05:10.410 --> 02:05:11.730]
You remember when Orlando had a mullet?

[02:05:12.350 --> 02:05:12.710]
No.

[02:05:13.610 --> 02:05:15.350]
Oh, well, all right. Picture Orlando would have picked a mullet.

[02:05:15.410 --> 02:05:17.630]
I don't ever see him. I think I've seen him twice in my life.

[02:05:21.050 --> 02:05:23.030]
And picture Orlando with a mullet.

[02:05:23.810 --> 02:05:25.130]
And that's Alex Marvez.

[02:05:25.350 --> 02:05:25.630]
Pretty close.

[02:05:26.330 --> 02:05:29.670]
Well, maybe that's Kenny's type. I don't know, but he's sure he wants him badly.

[02:05:29.810 --> 02:05:35.790]
Man, I have never heard anybody in my life ever salivate so desperate.

[02:05:35.790 --> 02:05:38.670]
Oh, Alex, you're so wonderful. Thank you so much for me.

[02:05:39.010 --> 02:05:44.290]
And here the guy's getting paid. It's not like he's coming in because he's a buddy or, you know, I'm the kindest of his heart.

[02:05:44.290 --> 02:05:46.110]
He wants to help us out on QAM.

[02:05:47.410 --> 02:05:50.390]
I wouldn't be surprised if he didn't pay by the people across the street.

[02:05:52.030 --> 02:05:52.390]
Savitage.

[02:05:54.550 --> 02:05:57.230]
I mean, what would you rather hear? Alex Marvez or Dead Air?

[02:05:58.190 --> 02:05:59.350]
Yes, I'm Chris, right?

[02:05:59.870 --> 02:06:00.770]
I'm asking anybody.

[02:06:02.370 --> 02:06:05.830]
Dead Air's Ephraim and Baton Rouge. He says, me, if I hear you now, I see.

[02:06:07.130 --> 02:06:09.350]
Oh, he's having a fit because of he's listening online.

[02:06:09.850 --> 02:06:11.670]
Oh, wait, nothing we can do about that, Ephraim, okay?

[02:06:12.510 --> 02:06:16.350]
Ephraim and Baton Rouge is listening online. He's belly aching about the spots during that.

[02:06:16.430 --> 02:06:18.050]
Nothing, what am I going to do about that?

[02:06:19.570 --> 02:06:22.450]
Nevertheless, I still love you. He says, last week we love you too, Ephraim.

[02:06:22.450 --> 02:06:24.550]
Quick complaining, quick belly aching, all right?

[02:06:24.830 --> 02:06:28.050]
Pretty soon you'll qualify to be in South Florida if you belly aching too much.

[02:06:28.590 --> 02:06:29.790]
Be like me. Don't complain.

[02:06:31.330 --> 02:06:31.450]
Yeah.

[02:06:33.810 --> 02:06:36.470]
958 votes on a poll of your favorite Jewish comedian of all time.

[02:06:36.870 --> 02:06:38.230]
How's Sammy Davis doing there, Doney?

[02:06:38.510 --> 02:06:39.670]
Did you put him on there? Of course.

[02:06:40.790 --> 02:06:48.670]
He's got two votes, which is two more than Rob Reiner or Andy Sandberg or Paul Reiser or Zepo Marks or Charles Groden.

[02:06:48.930 --> 02:06:49.550]
Already canter.

[02:06:51.070 --> 02:06:55.590]
A Charles Groden, what was he, what was he infecting us when he didn't have a talk show once upon a time?

[02:06:55.590 --> 02:06:57.090]
A talk show, five seconds.

[02:06:57.970 --> 02:07:05.710]
Oh my God, one of the most annoying, one of the most sour, one of the most negative people who ever, ever cross my path in my life.

[02:07:05.710 --> 02:07:08.270]
Charles Groden, annoying.

[02:07:09.410 --> 02:07:13.170]
I forgot all the details because you know certain things you try to put out of your mind.

[02:07:13.990 --> 02:07:16.430]
Like where it's Sanchez and then he pops up on CNN again.

[02:07:17.450 --> 02:07:21.190]
Charles Groden, and he's like, kind of like a make believe actor, right?

[02:07:22.250 --> 02:07:22.310]
Yeah.

[02:07:23.410 --> 02:07:24.530]
Make believe as a comedian.

[02:07:25.910 --> 02:07:28.150]
If you say so, I never would have called him that.

[02:07:28.230 --> 02:07:29.290]
That's what Charlie B said.

[02:07:29.650 --> 02:07:32.590]
Google Charles Groden, because I don't think he's a comedian. I think he's an actor.

[02:07:34.510 --> 02:07:37.550]
Well, he was in a comedy, does that make him a comedian?

[02:07:38.470 --> 02:07:38.950]
He's what?

[02:07:39.230 --> 02:07:40.370]
He was in comedy movies.

[02:07:40.850 --> 02:07:41.610]
I see, okay.

[02:07:42.030 --> 02:07:42.170]
All right.

[02:07:42.930 --> 02:07:44.650]
And he's Jewish, which listen, you know.

[02:07:46.130 --> 02:07:47.370]
Everybody's got a cross to beer.

[02:07:49.750 --> 02:07:51.710]
I mean, we also had Marlonsky.

[02:07:51.830 --> 02:07:53.930]
Although he was admired by the little old ladies on the beach.

[02:07:54.110 --> 02:07:54.610]
They loved him.

[02:07:54.670 --> 02:07:56.050]
Oh, he's such a wonderful man.

[02:07:56.390 --> 02:07:57.850]
He never stole a freight train.

[02:07:58.070 --> 02:07:59.970]
And he walks his little dog on the beach.

[02:08:03.850 --> 02:08:06.130]
Marlonsky, maybe, who's a real classy guy.

[02:08:07.350 --> 02:08:09.070]
Have we had enough Godfather yet?

[02:08:10.070 --> 02:08:10.510]
Never.

[02:08:10.710 --> 02:08:11.250]
There's no such thing.

[02:08:12.010 --> 02:08:12.230]
Really?

[02:08:12.750 --> 02:08:13.690]
If he asked me.

[02:08:14.690 --> 02:08:16.870]
Even study won't be able to call up Luca Brasi.

[02:08:17.570 --> 02:08:18.270]
I mean, yeah.

[02:08:19.490 --> 02:08:21.470]
Well, let me worry about Luca.

[02:08:22.430 --> 02:08:23.050]
He's so alive.

[02:08:24.050 --> 02:08:26.570]
They had almost five shots and he's full alive.

[02:08:27.370 --> 02:08:28.550]
That's bad luck for me.

[02:08:29.050 --> 02:08:31.450]
And bad luck for you if you don't make that deal.

[02:08:32.110 --> 02:08:33.310]
Time can you give me your dog?

[02:08:34.230 --> 02:08:35.290]
From time to time.

[02:08:35.590 --> 02:08:36.590]
You can't do it, Sally.

[02:08:37.030 --> 02:08:38.330]
This screws up all my arrangements.

[02:08:38.590 --> 02:08:39.610]
Screws up all my arrangements.

[02:08:39.910 --> 02:08:41.110]
That's what the Flora said, you know.

[02:08:42.250 --> 02:08:43.070]
When they had the hurricane,

[02:08:43.350 --> 02:08:44.190]
screws up all my arrangements.

[02:08:44.370 --> 02:08:45.130]
Didn't have what the Flora said?

[02:08:45.910 --> 02:08:46.030]
No.

[02:08:47.590 --> 02:08:48.590]
No more Godfather.

[02:08:49.170 --> 02:08:49.810]
Sorry, Brandon.

[02:08:50.030 --> 02:08:51.230]
We're taking a hiatus from the Godfather.

[02:08:51.610 --> 02:08:52.630]
In fact, I'll tell you what.

[02:08:53.210 --> 02:08:56.550]
The day we talk Godfather again will be the day I invite Alex Marvez on the show.

[02:08:58.250 --> 02:08:59.670]
Then you really believe that?

[02:09:00.010 --> 02:09:00.230]
No.

[02:09:01.230 --> 02:09:04.890]
961 votes on a full and rising danger field is blowing the competition away.

[02:09:05.130 --> 02:09:06.130]
This is on.

[02:09:06.590 --> 02:09:07.810]
This is not a tumor.

[02:09:08.110 --> 02:09:11.530]
It's the one to two hour tonight on logo.

[02:09:12.070 --> 02:09:16.170]
The Democratic presidential candidate space off in a queen size, the election event.

[02:09:16.670 --> 02:09:18.250]
The gay presidential debate.

[02:09:18.490 --> 02:09:21.130]
Senator Clinton, what is your message to gay voters?

[02:09:21.490 --> 02:09:24.010]
I'd like to have a conversation.

[02:09:24.010 --> 02:09:26.650]
Throw what I about those pants, sister.

[02:09:26.870 --> 02:09:31.510]
The candidates take on the issues that matter most to the gay community.

[02:09:31.590 --> 02:09:35.610]
Senator Edwards, everybody wants to know how much was that haircut?

[02:09:35.950 --> 02:09:38.690]
I think it was about $400 or so.

[02:09:38.750 --> 02:09:39.790]
That seems reasonable.

[02:09:40.190 --> 02:09:41.390]
It really frames your face.

[02:09:41.770 --> 02:09:45.530]
Will the frontrunners stay on top or will the challenger come from behind?

[02:09:46.050 --> 02:09:46.470]
Find out.

[02:09:46.710 --> 02:09:48.450]
Plus, immediately following the debate.

[02:09:48.850 --> 02:09:50.390]
Stay tuned for in-depth analysis.

[02:09:50.670 --> 02:09:51.890]
I liked Barack Obama.

[02:09:51.890 --> 02:09:53.430]
He was very cool.

[02:09:53.670 --> 02:09:55.850]
Call him my chocolate bug sickle.

[02:09:55.950 --> 02:09:56.670]
Oh, you.

[02:09:57.190 --> 02:10:00.350]
I still love Hillary, but John Edwards impressed me.

[02:10:00.590 --> 02:10:03.170]
I mean, he impressed me.

[02:10:03.430 --> 02:10:05.790]
Now, someone's gay that are going on.

[02:10:05.870 --> 02:10:06.950]
Paging and culture.

[02:10:07.550 --> 02:10:08.810]
The gay debate.

[02:10:09.050 --> 02:10:10.070]
Immediately following.

[02:10:10.350 --> 02:10:12.110]
Queer eye for the red state guy.

[02:10:12.390 --> 02:10:13.470]
Only on logo.

[02:10:14.010 --> 02:10:15.790]
102 at 560, WDQM.

[02:10:15.830 --> 02:10:16.770]
It's our big one to two hour.

[02:10:16.790 --> 02:10:18.750]
We're going to go over a thousand votes on a full of sour people.

[02:10:18.750 --> 02:10:20.830]
We're going to be screaming, shrieking, carrying on.

[02:10:20.830 --> 02:10:21.810]
Are you sure?

[02:10:22.170 --> 02:10:22.990]
Yeah, like that.

[02:10:23.310 --> 02:10:23.430]
See?

[02:10:23.650 --> 02:10:23.790]
Already.

[02:10:25.270 --> 02:10:25.630]
968.

[02:10:25.750 --> 02:10:26.150]
That's great.

[02:10:26.250 --> 02:10:26.750]
We got him made.

[02:10:27.450 --> 02:10:28.150]
There is no doubt.

[02:10:28.350 --> 02:10:31.250]
For just a second or two, I thought, oh, I was kind of slowing down here.

[02:10:32.530 --> 02:10:34.530]
Here's a fact that says, quick question.

[02:10:35.590 --> 02:10:37.130]
Have you been to your mother's grave yet?

[02:10:39.370 --> 02:10:40.050]
Me neither.

[02:10:40.850 --> 02:10:44.170]
My sister called me Saturday night and bitched me out for that and a bunch of other crap.

[02:10:44.570 --> 02:10:47.510]
And all I could think was you talking about not going to your mom's funeral, etc.

[02:10:47.910 --> 02:10:51.770]
Thanks for helping me validate my feelings about when the body dies, that's it, etc.

[02:10:51.990 --> 02:10:52.470]
You're welcome.

[02:10:53.970 --> 02:10:55.590]
Have you been to your mother's grave yet?

[02:10:55.670 --> 02:10:57.810]
Well, he obviously already knew the answer because it was me neither.

[02:10:58.670 --> 02:10:59.550]
What is that all about?

[02:11:01.990 --> 02:11:03.290]
What do people do that?

[02:11:08.070 --> 02:11:09.350]
I'm going to go to my father's grave.

[02:11:10.690 --> 02:11:11.810]
Yeah, and why are you going to do that?

[02:11:11.950 --> 02:11:12.590]
Dig up his head.

[02:11:13.350 --> 02:11:13.770]
Bronze it.

[02:11:13.890 --> 02:11:15.730]
Maybe you're an okay guy out of it.

[02:11:16.230 --> 02:11:18.010]
Seriously, why do people do that?

[02:11:18.530 --> 02:11:20.850]
Why do people go and talk to dead people?

[02:11:21.790 --> 02:11:22.350]
I don't know.

[02:11:23.090 --> 02:11:24.590]
Find out what it's like on the other side.

[02:11:26.450 --> 02:11:27.630]
I just know.

[02:11:28.750 --> 02:11:34.010]
All of these things that we're supposed to do because somebody, we don't know who the somebody was who said it,

[02:11:34.170 --> 02:11:38.450]
but somebody decided for us that it's a gesture of respect.

[02:11:40.450 --> 02:11:42.770]
A, to go to somebody's funeral and they're already dead.

[02:11:42.770 --> 02:11:44.210]
I mean, what's the point?

[02:11:44.730 --> 02:11:49.890]
Be nice to them when they're alive or be friendly to them or be helpful whenever they're alive.

[02:11:50.690 --> 02:11:52.670]
When they're dead, what's the point?

[02:11:55.050 --> 02:11:58.870]
And as far as the business is about visiting the tombstone, for what?

[02:12:00.630 --> 02:12:01.030]
Pizza.

[02:12:03.030 --> 02:12:03.750]
No, I don't know.

[02:12:03.990 --> 02:12:05.910]
Chris, you're going to visit my tombstone when I croak?

[02:12:06.430 --> 02:12:06.650]
I don't know.

[02:12:06.690 --> 02:12:07.470]
You're going to be up here down there.

[02:12:07.830 --> 02:12:08.730]
I'm still your head too.

[02:12:09.470 --> 02:12:09.750]
I am.

[02:12:10.010 --> 02:12:10.710]
Yeah, I'm going to do it with it.

[02:12:10.710 --> 02:12:11.870]
Brons it, put it on a shelf.

[02:12:13.790 --> 02:12:16.030]
Put a plaque on underneath it.

[02:12:16.090 --> 02:12:17.210]
You know, set it on a little pedestal.

[02:12:17.550 --> 02:12:21.450]
Charge of elimination of expensive health insurance and ever increasing rate of obesity.

[02:12:23.030 --> 02:12:25.410]
Appeared to be behind a startling fall by the U.S.

[02:12:25.530 --> 02:12:27.430]
and the world rankings of life expectancy.

[02:12:27.850 --> 02:12:30.730]
Talking about all these as a woman, they're living 114 in a cramp like that.

[02:12:32.130 --> 02:12:37.710]
Despite being one of the richest countries in the world, America has dropped from number 11 to number 42 in 20 years,

[02:12:38.050 --> 02:12:39.290]
according to official U.S. figures.

[02:12:40.050 --> 02:12:42.230]
From 11 to 42nd place.

[02:12:43.790 --> 02:12:48.090]
Dr. Christopher Murray headed the Institute of Health and Prickson Evaluation at the University of Wisconsin says,

[02:12:48.590 --> 02:12:52.890]
something's wrong here when one of the richest countries in the world, the one that spends the most in health care,

[02:12:52.990 --> 02:12:54.450]
is not able to keep up with other countries.

[02:12:55.370 --> 02:12:59.170]
The lack of health care available to many Americans, 45 million have no health insurance,

[02:12:59.590 --> 02:13:02.470]
is said to be one of the biggest issues next year's presidential campaign,

[02:13:02.830 --> 02:13:05.090]
the Democratic Contenders all promise universal health care.

[02:13:06.490 --> 02:13:14.490]
The decline reflects the disparity in wealth and life expectancy of African Americans is 73.3 compared to 77.9 for whites.

[02:13:15.630 --> 02:13:18.590]
For African American males, it's even shorter, 69.8.

[02:13:20.490 --> 02:13:22.390]
Jim McDermott, a Democratic Congressman, said,

[02:13:22.510 --> 02:13:25.450]
health care coverage is the single biggest domestic crisis facing America.

[02:13:25.830 --> 02:13:27.550]
It threatens all but the wealthiest Americans.

[02:13:28.050 --> 02:13:31.630]
If you aren't part of the richest 1%, then you know you are one living phone call,

[02:13:31.630 --> 02:13:35.370]
accidentally relays away from financial ruin because of a medical crisis.

[02:13:37.050 --> 02:13:40.110]
Obesity is frequently cited as among the causes of lower life expectancy,

[02:13:40.570 --> 02:13:43.970]
almost a third of U.S. adults are obese according to the national center for health statistics,

[02:13:44.410 --> 02:13:46.710]
which compared U.S. life expectancy with the rest of the world.

[02:13:48.050 --> 02:13:51.470]
Paul Terry, an assistant professor of epidemiology at Emory University of Atlanta, said,

[02:13:51.850 --> 02:13:54.890]
the U.S. has got the resources that allow people to get fat and lazy.

[02:13:55.690 --> 02:13:56.090]
Chris?

[02:14:00.270 --> 02:14:04.570]
Yes. The draft is also due to improved health care nutrition and lifestyle also in the world.

[02:14:04.950 --> 02:14:10.010]
Countries with longer life expectancy include most of Europe, Japan, Singapore, and Jordan.

[02:14:11.270 --> 02:14:14.770]
The U.S. also has higher infant mortality rate than many other countries.

[02:14:15.290 --> 02:14:17.270]
6.8 deaths for every thousand live births.

[02:14:17.330 --> 02:14:21.810]
The worst life expectancy figures are in Africa with Swaziland at the bottom 34-1 years.

[02:14:21.810 --> 02:14:23.170]
Is that John Cameron Swaziland?

[02:14:25.450 --> 02:14:25.890]
Yes.

[02:14:25.890 --> 02:14:28.090]
Remember John Cameron Swaziland took a looking and kept on ticking?

[02:14:28.590 --> 02:14:29.010]
Well done.

[02:14:32.310 --> 02:14:33.410]
Now what is this?

[02:14:33.670 --> 02:14:35.330]
It says you may want to consider going to the reunion.

[02:14:35.330 --> 02:14:38.650]
You wouldn't want to miss the 50th year commemorative naked swim.

[02:14:40.010 --> 02:14:40.450]
Right.

[02:14:41.510 --> 02:14:42.210]
Oh yeah!

[02:14:42.570 --> 02:14:45.730]
Which I'm sure must be a reference to the fact that we swim naked in the gym.

[02:14:45.770 --> 02:14:47.870]
Yeah. That still cracks me up.

[02:14:48.210 --> 02:14:48.490]
Why?

[02:14:48.490 --> 02:14:51.130]
I mean, it's so transparent.

[02:14:51.390 --> 02:14:52.790]
There's no absolutely no call.

[02:14:53.350 --> 02:14:54.050]
It's so gay.

[02:14:54.710 --> 02:14:55.250]
Yeah, absolutely.

[02:14:55.810 --> 02:14:56.830]
Well, what do you mean by transparent?

[02:14:57.250 --> 02:15:01.390]
Who would come up with an idea like that except for some pedophile teacher?

[02:15:01.730 --> 02:15:01.730]

[02:15:02.030 --> 02:15:02.290]
Yeah.

[02:15:04.950 --> 02:15:07.290]
Why would you say something like that about my gym teacher?

[02:15:07.490 --> 02:15:07.850]
He's dead.

[02:15:08.350 --> 02:15:08.730]
Fag.

[02:15:09.130 --> 02:15:09.470]
Pedophile?

[02:15:10.050 --> 02:15:11.550]
No, he was married with a family.

[02:15:11.770 --> 02:15:12.650]
So he was probably good.

[02:15:13.110 --> 02:15:13.770]
Good cover up.

[02:15:17.490 --> 02:15:19.050]
975 votes have worked for Merv Griffin.

[02:15:21.090 --> 02:15:25.930]
Who was married about 80 times now to kidnap him and he had that avicabura beard thing going on for a long time.

[02:15:26.070 --> 02:15:26.750]
Work for Merv.

[02:15:27.690 --> 02:15:30.030]
I wonder if he and Arthur Treacher were ever doing anything.

[02:15:30.950 --> 02:15:31.170]
Hmm.

[02:15:31.730 --> 02:15:33.410]
Now was it his show that Arthur Treacher?

[02:15:33.510 --> 02:15:34.110]
I'm sure it was.

[02:15:34.230 --> 02:15:35.370]
He was the announcer on it.

[02:15:35.390 --> 02:15:36.210]
He was like the Edmick Mann.

[02:15:37.790 --> 02:15:39.730]
You might want to Google Arthur Treacher.

[02:15:41.470 --> 02:15:44.230]
Do they still have those places Arthur Treacher's fish and chips?

[02:15:44.990 --> 02:15:48.850]
They've been incorporated into Miami subs now so it's not what they used to be.

[02:15:48.950 --> 02:15:50.510]
Nothing's what it used to be.

[02:15:50.630 --> 02:15:50.810]
Yeah.

[02:15:55.270 --> 02:15:56.270]
What does that mean?

[02:15:56.850 --> 02:15:59.110]
That means you can't get anything that you want anymore.

[02:15:59.390 --> 02:16:05.710]
You know, you used to go to Miami subs and get a shrimp platter and there'd be little side greek salad and those nice french fries and everything.

[02:16:05.710 --> 02:16:13.510]
And now when you order shrimp they give you a little shrimp box with those wheat white fries and nothing, no salad, nothing.

[02:16:13.790 --> 02:16:15.770]
You get what Arthur Treacher's would have given you.

[02:16:16.570 --> 02:16:17.230]
Which is crap.

[02:16:17.530 --> 02:16:18.570]
Long time sliver.

[02:16:19.050 --> 02:16:19.390]
Same thing.

[02:16:20.130 --> 02:16:20.810]
So that's still around?

[02:16:21.210 --> 02:16:21.550]
I don't know.

[02:16:23.210 --> 02:16:25.070]
See I'm not a fish person so I never would go to the fish.

[02:16:25.070 --> 02:16:25.910]
I know that.

[02:16:26.070 --> 02:16:26.310]
That's the right.

[02:16:26.590 --> 02:16:29.010]
Since so many people get sick from fish you know.

[02:16:29.530 --> 02:16:30.910]
They work for me poisoning things like that.

[02:16:31.150 --> 02:16:32.770]
All of these things.

[02:16:33.670 --> 02:16:36.450]
We're getting close to that thousand boys and girls and then.

[02:16:36.590 --> 02:16:38.030]
Oh, I'll use sports writers.

[02:16:38.290 --> 02:16:38.790]
Bye bye.

[02:16:39.690 --> 02:16:40.490]
9.79.

[02:16:40.910 --> 02:16:42.190]
So I guess that's the deal.

[02:16:43.330 --> 02:16:47.150]
Because we have this bogus affiliation with a sunsend like the other station across the street.

[02:16:47.150 --> 02:16:47.730]
Scott with a hero.

[02:16:48.070 --> 02:16:53.910]
So therefore we feel compelled to like suck up to their sports writers as if they're going to do anything for us which they don't.

[02:16:54.090 --> 02:16:55.770]
Which they absolutely do not.

[02:16:58.370 --> 02:17:00.050]
If anybody can prove me wrong.

[02:17:00.050 --> 02:17:03.150]
I want you to fax in or email the George.

[02:17:03.330 --> 02:17:04.990]
I want you to send to us any column.

[02:17:06.050 --> 02:17:14.750]
In which Alex Marvaz or Dave Hyde or Ethan Skolnik has said anything one word has written one positive word about WQM.

[02:17:16.630 --> 02:17:18.330]
You think we're going to find that Chris?

[02:17:19.290 --> 02:17:19.450]
No.

[02:17:21.970 --> 02:17:22.490]
Nothing.

[02:17:23.150 --> 02:17:23.530]
Zero.

[02:17:23.930 --> 02:17:26.150]
We hand them the keys to the kingdom and you know what they give us?

[02:17:27.530 --> 02:17:27.830]
Nothing.

[02:17:28.350 --> 02:17:29.490]
That's what they give us.

[02:17:29.490 --> 02:17:31.590]
A zetanjera does they say in China.

[02:17:32.150 --> 02:17:35.270]
And don't buy those toys from China and don't brush your teeth with that toothpaste.

[02:17:38.550 --> 02:17:42.670]
As a matter of fact, the Sutton Place Hotel right in Toronto downtown.

[02:17:43.110 --> 02:17:46.590]
They were using a very expensive overpriced hotel by the way.

[02:17:46.890 --> 02:17:48.210]
They were using a Chinese toothpaste.

[02:17:48.510 --> 02:17:49.950]
It was announced to this morning on the news.

[02:17:52.390 --> 02:17:58.190]
So just because you stand in an expensive hotel it's overpriced and you know, artsy, artsy and hoydie, toady.

[02:17:58.190 --> 02:18:00.630]
That doesn't mean that you're going to wind up coming out of their alive.

[02:18:01.390 --> 02:18:04.210]
Because they're going to like load you up with some Chinese toothpaste.

[02:18:05.390 --> 02:18:06.710]
I'd rather have bad breath.

[02:18:07.910 --> 02:18:09.850]
I'd rather go out and buy some clorets.

[02:18:11.490 --> 02:18:12.690]
Never two clorets?

[02:18:13.730 --> 02:18:15.570]
Two clorets. They have the chewable.

[02:18:16.410 --> 02:18:16.850]
Gum.

[02:18:17.510 --> 02:18:17.670]
No.

[02:18:18.850 --> 02:18:21.270]
I know that you're talking to a clorets spray.

[02:18:21.270 --> 02:18:22.250]
Yeah, the spray, sure.

[02:18:22.710 --> 02:18:24.810]
And then the elaz news that you like suck on.

[02:18:26.030 --> 02:18:27.330]
9.709 in the pool.

[02:18:27.490 --> 02:18:29.730]
We're going to get to a thousand in this half hour.

[02:18:30.910 --> 02:18:32.250]
And then you watch them.

[02:18:32.370 --> 02:18:35.930]
Joel Fiber, you're going to see him sitting out in the middle of traffic on 4.41 with his hand.

[02:18:36.230 --> 02:18:38.650]
And his head in his hands crying like a baby.

[02:18:39.670 --> 02:18:41.170]
Oh, first it was Wayne.

[02:18:41.410 --> 02:18:43.490]
And now that bag is back on it.

[02:18:45.130 --> 02:18:45.910]
Crybaby Joel.

[02:18:47.490 --> 02:18:50.290]
The dolphin organization doesn't care about your business.

[02:18:50.490 --> 02:18:51.750]
Okay, and neither does anybody else.

[02:18:51.890 --> 02:18:52.950]
Nobody with a brain does.

[02:18:54.170 --> 02:18:55.270]
Erasas. That's the word.

[02:18:55.730 --> 02:18:58.650]
Just like Daniel Abashi with all his make-believe, my-space friends,

[02:18:59.050 --> 02:19:01.950]
and make-believe this and make-believe Hank Goldberg and make-believe Stugas.

[02:19:02.170 --> 02:19:04.170]
And that's the whole thing over there.

[02:19:04.270 --> 02:19:04.830]
Make-believe.

[02:19:05.670 --> 02:19:08.750]
They ought to have Conway Tweetie come there and sing the farewell song.

[02:19:09.610 --> 02:19:10.830]
If he were only still alive.

[02:19:12.490 --> 02:19:13.770]
So that's the way I look at the reunion.

[02:19:14.010 --> 02:19:16.370]
I mean, these people aren't dead yet, but we're getting pretty close.

[02:19:16.610 --> 02:19:18.190]
Getting close to the end of the line, you know?

[02:19:18.830 --> 02:19:21.630]
So why would you want to go and see 50 years later?

[02:19:21.630 --> 02:19:23.750]
What people look like just before they're going to die.

[02:19:24.350 --> 02:19:26.070]
Like I said, only if they were friends of yours.

[02:19:27.430 --> 02:19:30.050]
And I mean, friends, not people you knew.

[02:19:31.930 --> 02:19:34.190]
Yeah. Well, they weren't.

[02:19:34.550 --> 02:19:34.910]
Well then.

[02:19:35.170 --> 02:19:36.070]
I mean, like school, right?

[02:19:36.330 --> 02:19:37.490]
You know, like school buddies.

[02:19:37.910 --> 02:19:42.170]
I'm not like socialized because I couldn't socialize because I wasn't allowed to socialize with a go-am.

[02:19:42.270 --> 02:19:43.510]
And all the kids in school were go-am.

[02:19:46.170 --> 02:19:46.730]
They're lost.

[02:19:47.710 --> 02:19:48.310]
Yeah, that's right.

[02:19:48.350 --> 02:19:49.250]
Look what they missed out on.

[02:19:51.230 --> 02:19:54.150]
12 minutes after- I'm thinking to myself what I missed out on.

[02:19:54.270 --> 02:19:55.690]
12 minutes after one or QA and week.

[02:19:55.830 --> 02:19:58.070]
You know that the Lord even loves neo-rodris.

[02:20:01.810 --> 02:20:07.010]
Coming soon to retail store somewhere, a new toy line that is evidently sent.

[02:20:07.430 --> 02:20:10.110]
Introducing Jesus and the Bible Bodies.

[02:20:10.650 --> 02:20:13.630]
Jesus and the Bible Bodies are sturdy, tough action figures.

[02:20:13.910 --> 02:20:17.330]
They'll let you live out your favorite moments from the old and new testaments.

[02:20:17.330 --> 02:20:22.150]
Old Testament favorites include John the Baptist, now with removable head.

[02:20:23.050 --> 02:20:26.530]
Moses complete with stone tablets and burning bush stand-up kits.

[02:20:26.830 --> 02:20:28.850]
I've got the love, God, of the power of my hands.

[02:20:29.330 --> 02:20:32.370]
And don't forget the new Canaan Abel double pack.

[02:20:32.750 --> 02:20:33.970]
Cool. They're brothers.

[02:20:34.590 --> 02:20:40.210]
Then get set for all the adventures of the new Testament with a complete line of Jesus action figures.

[02:20:40.810 --> 02:20:44.310]
There's break in the bread Jesus, complete with bread and wine substitute.

[02:20:44.310 --> 02:20:47.510]
Take a seat. This is my body of the new covenant which is given to me.

[02:20:47.530 --> 02:20:51.130]
Risen from the dead Jesus with a glow in the dark resurrection tape.

[02:20:51.170 --> 02:20:52.650]
I defeated Satan.

[02:20:53.210 --> 02:20:56.350]
And new this fall, it's pulmized, stringed Jesus.

[02:20:56.870 --> 02:20:59.890]
Listen as our Lord and Savior recites well known Bible passages.

[02:21:00.410 --> 02:21:01.750]
It is finished.

[02:21:02.290 --> 02:21:04.190]
It's cool. It's like I'm right next to the cross.

[02:21:04.650 --> 02:21:06.790]
It's Jesus and the Bible Bodies.

[02:21:07.150 --> 02:21:09.850]
Collect them separately or get them in the Apostle 12 pack.

[02:21:10.170 --> 02:21:11.110]
Salvation never couldn't.

[02:21:12.030 --> 02:21:14.390]
Okay, 117 and 560 WQ William.

[02:21:14.570 --> 02:21:17.010]
Well, I watched the elevation and he can come visit me in my grave.

[02:21:17.150 --> 02:21:18.110]
And we can have a chat.

[02:21:18.730 --> 02:21:19.070]
All right.

[02:21:19.570 --> 02:21:19.990]
Yeah.

[02:21:20.970 --> 02:21:22.790]
Of course, like a sack of like...

[02:21:23.990 --> 02:21:26.190]
...like that, you know, a little muffled in that box.

[02:21:26.350 --> 02:21:27.530]
Maybe you could like drill some air holes.

[02:21:29.490 --> 02:21:29.930]
Or...

[02:21:29.930 --> 02:21:30.830]
...some air holes?

[02:21:31.070 --> 02:21:31.350]
Sure.

[02:21:32.370 --> 02:21:33.670]
Oh no. Or go ahead.

[02:21:33.870 --> 02:21:34.250]
And what is that?

[02:21:35.070 --> 02:21:37.190]
It's what is called our Anseling.

[02:21:37.190 --> 02:21:39.830]
So that sounds very insensitive because they're showing the mind,

[02:21:39.990 --> 02:21:41.690]
rescuing what news conference on there now.

[02:21:41.850 --> 02:21:42.110]
Uh-huh.

[02:21:42.390 --> 02:21:43.250]
And they're drilling these holes.

[02:21:43.750 --> 02:21:45.610]
It's taking them forever to drill the holes.

[02:21:45.830 --> 02:21:48.110]
But in the meantime, how many days has it been now, like eight or nine?

[02:21:48.590 --> 02:21:50.130]
Yeah, it's a sad situation.

[02:21:51.370 --> 02:21:53.010]
What you're trying to say is, Morteau.

[02:21:53.710 --> 02:21:55.350]
I don't want to say any such thing.

[02:21:55.470 --> 02:21:57.590]
Well, look at that. Don't tell me the market stayed another dime today.

[02:21:57.770 --> 02:21:59.230]
Thank God I don't have one dime in the market.

[02:21:59.390 --> 02:22:00.450]
All you smart asses.

[02:22:00.550 --> 02:22:03.070]
Oh, we're going to show you, Neil, the market's up to 13,000.

[02:22:03.150 --> 02:22:04.130]
Yeah. Good luck to you.

[02:22:05.970 --> 02:22:08.650]
Look at that. The Dow's down 128 points again today.

[02:22:08.850 --> 02:22:10.290]
And it's just one of those things, you know.

[02:22:10.410 --> 02:22:14.090]
And the dollar ain't worth, uh, you can't even buy a soda anymore for a dollar.

[02:22:15.270 --> 02:22:15.890]
Am I right?

[02:22:16.470 --> 02:22:16.670]
Right.

[02:22:17.690 --> 02:22:19.050]
Uh, and you go to the airport.

[02:22:19.370 --> 02:22:21.170]
And let me give you a little advice. Don't go to the airport.

[02:22:21.490 --> 02:22:23.670]
If you want to fly somewhere, have a good time. But don't go to the airport.

[02:22:23.970 --> 02:22:24.650]
Not in South Florida.

[02:22:25.270 --> 02:22:26.630]
For a lot of days, it's impossible.

[02:22:26.870 --> 02:22:28.770]
And my international is beyond impossible.

[02:22:29.170 --> 02:22:30.910]
The security there, they will, uh, they'll kill you.

[02:22:32.570 --> 02:22:32.890]
990.

[02:22:34.270 --> 02:22:36.570]
990 votes. This segment will go over 1,000.

[02:22:36.830 --> 02:22:38.690]
And then, then goodbye.

[02:22:39.150 --> 02:22:41.270]
In fact, I can hear chicken neck working on it right now.

[02:22:41.710 --> 02:22:42.890]
Bye-bye, Alex Marvez.

[02:22:43.590 --> 02:22:44.210]
Okay, you hear it?

[02:22:44.590 --> 02:22:45.870]
Bye-bye, Ethan Skolnick.

[02:22:45.910 --> 02:22:46.290]
I hear it now.

[02:22:46.690 --> 02:22:48.130]
Then we can have like a whole series of them.

[02:22:50.150 --> 02:22:52.610]
Still low sound of the miners eight days after the collapse.

[02:22:52.770 --> 02:22:55.730]
And there's that fat turd guy who keeps so, you know, pacing nervously.

[02:22:55.870 --> 02:22:56.230]
What's his name?

[02:23:03.310 --> 02:23:04.430]
Why are they doing this?

[02:23:05.790 --> 02:23:08.070]
Well, why don't we hear the sound of whatever they're digging on.

[02:23:09.790 --> 02:23:10.150]
Hello!

[02:23:10.430 --> 02:23:11.230]
Damn, roll! Stop!

[02:23:11.490 --> 02:23:12.250]
Yeah, I'm not even.

[02:23:12.690 --> 02:23:13.990]
Better watch the light, John.

[02:23:14.110 --> 02:23:16.210]
You're live on CNN, Mr. U. But I watch it.

[02:23:17.110 --> 02:23:18.630]
It sounds like a bunch of rednights there.

[02:23:18.790 --> 02:23:20.090]
Now, where's that? That's in Utah, right?

[02:23:21.670 --> 02:23:21.970]
Yes.

[02:23:22.450 --> 02:23:24.410]
What kind of people are in Utah besides Mormons?

[02:23:24.410 --> 02:23:26.530]
Are there any people besides Mormons in Utah or what?

[02:23:26.610 --> 02:23:27.750]
There are some others.

[02:23:28.490 --> 02:23:29.050]
But not too many.

[02:23:29.270 --> 02:23:29.390]
No.

[02:23:29.790 --> 02:23:30.950]
Not if they know what's good for them.

[02:23:31.170 --> 02:23:31.290]
Right.

[02:23:32.210 --> 02:23:34.070]
Paul Kruggman writes, it's all about them.

[02:23:35.050 --> 02:23:36.990]
He said, ask not what your country can do for you.

[02:23:37.130 --> 02:23:39.270]
Ask what you can do for your father's political campaign.

[02:23:40.730 --> 02:23:45.190]
Last week, he wanted Mitt Romney's asked Mitt forums, a woman in the audience asked Mr. Romney,

[02:23:45.330 --> 02:23:48.670]
whether any of his five sons are serving in the military and if not when they plan to enlist.

[02:23:50.030 --> 02:23:52.730]
The candidate replied with a rambling attempt to change the subject,

[02:23:52.730 --> 02:23:55.170]
but near the end, he let his real feelings slip.

[02:23:56.030 --> 02:23:57.910]
It's remarkable how we can show our support for our nation.

[02:23:57.910 --> 02:24:00.830]
He said, and one of the ways my sons are showing support for our nation

[02:24:00.830 --> 02:24:03.790]
is helping to get me elected because they think I'd be a great president.

[02:24:05.610 --> 02:24:05.970]
Wow.

[02:24:06.550 --> 02:24:09.590]
The important point isn't the fact that Mr. Romney's sons aren't in uniform,

[02:24:09.990 --> 02:24:13.910]
although it's striking just how few of those who claim to believe that were engaged in the struggle for our very existence.

[02:24:14.370 --> 02:24:16.590]
Think that they themselves should be called on to make any sacrifices.

[02:24:17.110 --> 02:24:21.170]
The point is instead that Mr. Romney apparently considers helping him get elected in the act of service

[02:24:21.170 --> 02:24:23.350]
comparable to putting your life online in Iraq.

[02:24:24.630 --> 02:24:28.390]
Yet the weak surprise for most self-settled remark by a serious presidential contender

[02:24:28.390 --> 02:24:32.470]
goes not to Mr. Romney, but to his principal rival for the GOP nomination.

[02:24:33.690 --> 02:24:38.530]
Rudy Giuliani has likely been getting some long overdue criticism for his missteps both before and after 9-11.

[02:24:38.630 --> 02:24:43.430]
For example, the village voice reports that he insisted that the city's emergency command center,

[02:24:44.270 --> 02:24:48.490]
which had footed a personal suite with its own elevator that he visited often even on weekends,

[02:24:48.490 --> 02:24:51.490]
bringing his girlfriend, Judy Nathen, there along before the relationship surfaced,

[02:24:52.290 --> 02:24:54.010]
be within walking distance of city hall.

[02:24:54.750 --> 02:24:58.010]
This led to the disastrous decision to locate the center in the World Trade Center

[02:24:58.010 --> 02:24:59.710]
and obvious potential terrorist target.

[02:25:00.930 --> 02:25:04.570]
At the same time, Mr. Giuliani is being attacked for his failure to take adequate precautions

[02:25:04.570 --> 02:25:08.150]
to protect those who worked on the cleanup ground zero from the hazards at the site.

[02:25:08.490 --> 02:25:11.290]
Many workers have since been sickened by the dust and toxic materials.

[02:25:12.490 --> 02:25:16.310]
For a politician whose entire campaign is based on the myth of his leadership that Faithful Day

[02:25:16.310 --> 02:25:19.870]
is the onion-putted, Mr. Giuliani is running for a president of 9-11.

[02:25:20.430 --> 02:25:23.030]
Anything that challenges his personal legend is a big problem.

[02:25:23.630 --> 02:25:25.670]
So here's what Giuliani said last week in response.

[02:25:26.430 --> 02:25:29.110]
I was at ground zero as often if not more than most of the workers.

[02:25:29.530 --> 02:25:33.930]
I was exposed to exactly the same things they were exposed to, so in that sense, I'm one of them.

[02:25:35.330 --> 02:25:39.610]
Real ground zero workers who were digging through the toxic rubble while Mr. Giuliani held photo-offs

[02:25:39.610 --> 02:25:41.270]
were understandably outraged.

[02:25:41.270 --> 02:25:46.430]
So the next day Giuliani tried to recover claiming what I was trying to say yesterday is that I empathize

[02:25:46.430 --> 02:25:48.310]
with them because I feel I have that same risk.

[02:25:48.790 --> 02:25:53.630]
But thanks to the wonders of you, we can all watch Giuliani's actual demeanor as the delivered

[02:25:53.630 --> 02:25:56.090]
original remarks empathy had nothing to do with it.

[02:25:56.790 --> 02:26:01.010]
What's striking about these unintentional moments of self-revelation is how much Giuliani

[02:26:01.010 --> 02:26:03.530]
and Romney sound like the current occupant of the White House.

[02:26:04.290 --> 02:26:07.730]
It's been long clear that President Bush doesn't feel other people's pain.

[02:26:07.730 --> 02:26:11.970]
His self-centeredness shines through whenever he makes the author cuff unscripted remarks from his

[02:26:11.970 --> 02:26:17.130]
jactular obliviousness in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina to the joke he made last year in San Antonio

[02:26:17.130 --> 02:26:20.530]
when he visited the Brook Army Medical Center which treats the severely wounded.

[02:26:21.170 --> 02:26:25.030]
As you can possibly see, I have an injury myself not here at the hospital

[02:26:25.030 --> 02:26:27.230]
but in combat with a Cedar I eventually won.

[02:26:27.630 --> 02:26:29.210]
The Cedar gave me the little scratch, he said.

[02:26:30.590 --> 02:26:34.230]
What's now clear is that the two main most likely enough is the GOP presidential nominee

[02:26:34.230 --> 02:26:37.010]
are cut from the same cloth. This probably isn't a coincidence.

[02:26:37.910 --> 02:26:42.530]
Arguably, the current state of the Republican Party is such that only extreme narcissists have a chance to get

[02:26:42.530 --> 02:26:42.910]
nominated.

[02:26:44.250 --> 02:26:49.650]
To be a serious presidential contentor actor, you have to be a fairly smart guy and nobody's accused either Romney

[02:26:49.650 --> 02:26:50.810]
or Giuliani of being stupid.

[02:26:51.430 --> 02:26:55.470]
To appeal to the GOP based however, you have to say very stupid things like Romney's declaration

[02:26:55.470 --> 02:27:00.450]
that we should double Gitmo or Giuliani's dismissal of the idea that raising taxes is sometimes necessary

[02:27:00.450 --> 02:27:04.030]
to pay for things like repairing bridges is a democratic liberal assumption.

[02:27:04.970 --> 02:27:10.350]
So the GOP feel is dominated by smart men willing to play dumb to further their personal ambitions.

[02:27:10.870 --> 02:27:14.210]
We shouldn't be surprised then to learn that these men are monstrously self-centered.

[02:27:15.090 --> 02:27:20.890]
All of us, all of which leaves us with a political question, most voters are thoroughly fed up with the current narcissists in chief.

[02:27:21.170 --> 02:27:22.550]
Are they really ready to elect another one?

[02:27:23.470 --> 02:27:28.350]
And let's hope the answer is Paul Krupp went in the end of time and you heard it here at no charge.

[02:27:28.350 --> 02:27:35.250]
Oh geez, reading the newspaper again. Oh my god, Neil, what happened to those olden days, those great old shows?

[02:27:37.530 --> 02:27:38.590]
Those great calls.

[02:27:40.010 --> 02:27:42.490]
I just wonder, I look at that phone, I don't see any lines ringing.

[02:27:43.590 --> 02:27:48.970]
I was thinking, I was, you know, I didn't say I was going to take it.

[02:27:48.970 --> 02:27:49.590]
Oh, okay.

[02:27:51.250 --> 02:27:54.090]
Actually, I actually have the thing turned on now.

[02:27:58.830 --> 02:27:59.550]
996, 797.

[02:28:00.750 --> 02:28:04.850]
Now before this next break, we better get those other three votes to get to a thousand by the bottom of the hour.

[02:28:05.230 --> 02:28:07.690]
And then after that, it'll be like, it'll be like frosting on the cake.

[02:28:08.230 --> 02:28:09.350]
It'll be like the gravy train.

[02:28:11.090 --> 02:28:12.010]
Every gravy train?

[02:28:12.690 --> 02:28:14.790]
No, no, no, pureed a dog shout, that was my brand.

[02:28:17.210 --> 02:28:19.090]
Alpo always seemed rather interesting to me.

[02:28:19.610 --> 02:28:21.210]
Until I found out what it was made from.

[02:28:22.590 --> 02:28:24.010]
I like the dry myself.

[02:28:24.890 --> 02:28:26.590]
Disease animal parts, stuff like that.

[02:28:27.770 --> 02:28:31.590]
What do you think, Chris? Can we do it by the time we do the last break this half hour or what?

[02:28:32.010 --> 02:28:32.010]

[02:28:32.810 --> 02:28:33.990]
998, that's kind of great.

[02:28:34.330 --> 02:28:37.610]
We're driven is dead, by the way. The scooter is dead. Phil Rosuto died.

[02:28:38.810 --> 02:28:42.530]
Oh my god. And what was the big, she died yesterday?

[02:28:44.570 --> 02:28:46.550]
Aster. What was her name? I figured what her name was.

[02:28:47.250 --> 02:28:48.930]
I would have asked her, but she's dead.

[02:28:48.930 --> 02:28:50.430]
Cast her into the sea. I don't know.

[02:28:50.970 --> 02:28:53.170]
Aster. She was the big socialite.

[02:28:53.390 --> 02:28:57.030]
She gave $200 million to charity because she inherited the Zivians of dollars.

[02:28:57.990 --> 02:28:59.070]
Whatever her name was.

[02:28:59.750 --> 02:29:02.890]
I don't put her in the same category with Murf and certainly not with the scooter.

[02:29:03.850 --> 02:29:04.490]
Are you kidding me?

[02:29:04.650 --> 02:29:06.450]
Early cow? Early cow?

[02:29:08.410 --> 02:29:12.850]
See the Yankee organization back from the days in the early 60s when they had Mel Allen,

[02:29:13.310 --> 02:29:14.950]
Red Barber, and Jim Woods.

[02:29:14.950 --> 02:29:20.070]
When they had maybe the greatest broadcast, baseball broadcast team ever assembled in history.

[02:29:21.310 --> 02:29:28.130]
And then we go to the scooter and Jerry Coleman and Bill White and a bunch of other...

[02:29:28.130 --> 02:29:31.190]
Oh my, and then of course John Sterling, who's crazy than a bedbuck.

[02:29:32.810 --> 02:29:33.770]
No, Yankee.

[02:29:34.350 --> 02:29:38.150]
Anybody else did that on here. They would come to the men and white coats and drag them away.

[02:29:38.690 --> 02:29:39.690]
He's a crazy person.

[02:29:40.390 --> 02:29:42.610]
What? You know John Sterling?

[02:29:42.610 --> 02:29:44.350]
Oh no, I'm just saying a thousand two.

[02:29:45.290 --> 02:29:46.590]
A thousand two votes.

[02:29:46.930 --> 02:29:48.970]
Edibleite Chris. He's got his eye on that field.

[02:29:49.110 --> 02:29:50.890]
Because he knows he's responsible for it.

[02:29:51.170 --> 02:29:51.410]
Exactly.

[02:29:51.970 --> 02:29:54.030]
He's the one that put us over the edge today.

[02:29:54.350 --> 02:29:56.450]
So now that we got it, it's not even one thirty yet.

[02:29:57.050 --> 02:29:59.990]
To me, that's like the whole audience getting the other like Howard Beard,

[02:29:59.990 --> 02:30:02.130]
you know, opening the window up and screaming out the window.

[02:30:02.590 --> 02:30:04.790]
No more sports riders. I'm QAM.

[02:30:05.070 --> 02:30:05.970]
That's what they're screaming.

[02:30:06.410 --> 02:30:09.230]
So do I go in this break? Do I go and tell Josh it's not allowed to have them on anyone?

[02:30:09.230 --> 02:30:15.770]
Tell him no more. No more Alice Marvez. No more Ethan Skolik. No Manasha Skolik.

[02:30:16.030 --> 02:30:17.110]
And certainly no more Beast.

[02:30:18.250 --> 02:30:23.610]
Britney Spears has reportedly had another breakdown while filming a video in Los Angeles.

[02:30:24.050 --> 02:30:29.270]
With his it said she appeared disoriented and erratic during the shoot for her new single Get Back.

[02:30:29.750 --> 02:30:32.770]
Onlookers also said she made several trips to the bathroom.

[02:30:33.030 --> 02:30:35.030]
But maybe it's not what you think.

[02:30:35.410 --> 02:30:37.210]
Hi, welcome to Starbucks. May I take your order?

[02:30:37.210 --> 02:30:40.650]
Hello, can I get a blind date at the keynote?

[02:30:41.130 --> 02:30:42.030]
Are you Britney Spears?

[02:30:42.250 --> 02:30:44.210]
Yeah, what's that in the front of your pants?

[02:30:44.550 --> 02:30:45.090]
Oops.

[02:30:45.510 --> 02:30:53.030]
Boots. Bevers out of guns. Like a leaky pan. She needs a defense.

[02:30:53.650 --> 02:30:55.590]
The money I want to have a pretzel.

[02:30:55.830 --> 02:30:56.630]
All right, show me.

[02:30:56.650 --> 02:31:00.930]
And I have a big call out that they say that I got a pants.

[02:31:01.230 --> 02:31:01.650]
Oops.

[02:31:02.650 --> 02:31:04.890]
Boots. Bevers out of guns.

[02:31:05.590 --> 02:31:07.450]
Like a water jet.

[02:31:08.290 --> 02:31:09.870]
Britney, no get wet.

[02:31:10.370 --> 02:31:12.670]
Hey, yo, Britney. I want to have the kids this weekend.

[02:31:12.950 --> 02:31:15.290]
You can't have the kids the kids that I'm gonna lie.

[02:31:15.590 --> 02:31:17.830]
Britney, I'm responsible. I don't go drinking anymore.

[02:31:17.990 --> 02:31:18.630]
I don't say that.

[02:31:18.830 --> 02:31:20.710]
Oh, Britney, what's that on the front of your pants?

[02:31:21.190 --> 02:31:27.250]
Oops. Bevers out of guns. Like Niagara Falls.

[02:31:27.890 --> 02:31:29.370]
Can't make it to fall.

[02:31:30.150 --> 02:31:33.990]
As a plumber, I'm here to fix you problem there. Who are you?

[02:31:33.990 --> 02:31:35.970]
I'm pop star Britney fans.

[02:31:36.070 --> 02:31:38.550]
Yeah, fairly. You got some leaky drum moves.

[02:31:38.570 --> 02:31:39.370]
Oh, she's so bad.

[02:31:39.610 --> 02:31:41.530]
Oh, geez, I didn't know that's where it was.

[02:31:42.070 --> 02:31:42.550]
Oops.

[02:31:42.810 --> 02:31:45.470]
Oops. Bevers out of guns.

[02:31:46.250 --> 02:31:50.270]
Hey, what's the matter with Britney's platter?

[02:31:50.910 --> 02:31:52.130]
Let's go get guys.

[02:31:52.350 --> 02:31:53.370]
Yeah, let's go get guys.

[02:31:53.730 --> 02:31:56.410]
I'm really horny. I'm really ill still hot.

[02:31:56.730 --> 02:31:57.870]
Yeah, I'm so fresh.

[02:31:58.230 --> 02:31:59.010]
Yeah, what?

[02:31:59.390 --> 02:32:01.030]
Why are you ready to take half of the diaper?

[02:32:01.330 --> 02:32:01.910]
Isn't it hot?

[02:32:02.190 --> 02:32:03.010]
I would ever have a cat.

[02:32:03.010 --> 02:32:05.230]
I just wouldn't be fine, cool, it's like, pass out.

[02:32:05.310 --> 02:32:05.670]
How about you?

[02:32:05.930 --> 02:32:06.550]
I'll go say that.

[02:32:06.830 --> 02:32:07.130]
Why?

[02:32:07.470 --> 02:32:10.690]
Oh, she paid herself again.

[02:32:11.450 --> 02:32:15.770]
Just like a rainstorm. Her panty is warm.

[02:32:16.830 --> 02:32:18.510]
So she had a P in problem or what?

[02:32:18.610 --> 02:32:20.110]
I hadn't heard that because I don't pay any attention.

[02:32:20.310 --> 02:32:20.790]
I couldn't cure her.

[02:32:21.130 --> 02:32:21.910]
Apparently. Yeah.

[02:32:22.190 --> 02:32:23.070]
Oh, geez.

[02:32:24.950 --> 02:32:27.630]
132 at 560 WQM. These are the important things.

[02:32:27.790 --> 02:32:29.310]
Here's the poll. We got a thousand ten votes.

[02:32:29.490 --> 02:32:29.990]
Ten ten.

[02:32:29.990 --> 02:32:30.610]
Ten ten.

[02:32:30.610 --> 02:32:33.330]
Ten ten wins New York and ten ten CFRB Toronto.

[02:32:34.890 --> 02:32:36.690]
Who's your favorite Jewish comedian of all time?

[02:32:36.830 --> 02:32:38.050]
I'm only going to read like a couple.

[02:32:38.490 --> 02:32:39.570]
Rodney Dangerfield 195.

[02:32:40.310 --> 02:32:41.270]
Mel Brooks 122.

[02:32:41.390 --> 02:32:42.790]
Nobody else even close to 100.

[02:32:44.050 --> 02:32:45.430]
Jerry Seinfeld is still third.

[02:32:45.650 --> 02:32:48.130]
I mean, I'm not going to say it.

[02:32:48.290 --> 02:32:49.010]
What's the use?

[02:32:50.670 --> 02:32:50.990]
Why do I?

[02:32:51.470 --> 02:32:52.970]
Uncle Mildys only got 12.

[02:32:53.090 --> 02:32:54.150]
Milton Broell 12 votes.

[02:32:55.410 --> 02:32:57.010]
Does that send you everything we need to know?

[02:32:57.010 --> 02:32:58.390]
Jack Venny's got 27.

[02:33:00.010 --> 02:33:01.870]
Jerry Lewis has got ten.

[02:33:02.490 --> 02:33:03.850]
He started with Sarah Silverman.

[02:33:05.670 --> 02:33:06.630]
Mohaward Mohaward.

[02:33:07.330 --> 02:33:09.290]
I'm thinking I always want to say Mohaward David.

[02:33:09.410 --> 02:33:11.330]
I did Mohaward nine.

[02:33:12.470 --> 02:33:14.610]
As opposed to Curly who's got 54.

[02:33:16.110 --> 02:33:17.790]
And Shimp has got four.

[02:33:20.270 --> 02:33:21.530]
Now who we leaving out?

[02:33:21.610 --> 02:33:24.130]
Are we leaving somebody out from the three stooges?

[02:33:24.130 --> 02:33:25.190]
Larry Moan Curly.

[02:33:25.190 --> 02:33:26.670]
Larry and Shimp.

[02:33:26.830 --> 02:33:28.530]
And there was that Joe there for five minutes.

[02:33:28.670 --> 02:33:30.510]
And I don't even know if he was Jewish, but he's not worthy.

[02:33:30.910 --> 02:33:31.370]
Joe Mama?

[02:33:31.490 --> 02:33:31.650]
No.

[02:33:32.130 --> 02:33:33.330]
Gene Wilder's only got three.

[02:33:33.690 --> 02:33:34.890]
Carl Reiner finally got three.

[02:33:35.750 --> 02:33:36.930]
It went got two.

[02:33:37.030 --> 02:33:38.630]
Simply vote because I was bitching about that.

[02:33:38.930 --> 02:33:39.830]
Al Jolson had two.

[02:33:40.170 --> 02:33:41.730]
Man, me how I love you.

[02:33:42.610 --> 02:33:43.210]
Read a Rudner one.

[02:33:44.710 --> 02:33:45.510]
Gomo's got one.

[02:33:45.870 --> 02:33:47.030]
And Chico's got one.

[02:33:48.130 --> 02:33:49.390]
See, that's what I understand.

[02:33:49.530 --> 02:33:51.330]
Anybody that runs, that's only one vote.

[02:33:52.690 --> 02:33:54.070]
Rob Reiner has got none.

[02:33:55.390 --> 02:33:56.450]
Paul Reaser none.

[02:33:56.750 --> 02:33:57.450]
Zepo Marks none.

[02:33:57.590 --> 02:33:58.190]
Andy Sanber.

[02:33:58.250 --> 02:33:58.650]
Reiser.

[02:33:59.910 --> 02:34:00.310]
What?

[02:34:00.890 --> 02:34:02.170]
Paul Robert Reiser.

[02:34:02.510 --> 02:34:03.070]
Bobby Reaser?

[02:34:04.650 --> 02:34:05.590]
Zepo Marks none.

[02:34:05.850 --> 02:34:06.670]
Charles Groden none.

[02:34:06.790 --> 02:34:07.630]
Eddie Cantor's zero.

[02:34:08.930 --> 02:34:11.870]
If you knew Susie, Eddie and I had a Cantor.

[02:34:11.950 --> 02:34:13.030]
Man, they weren't TV in the early days.

[02:34:13.050 --> 02:34:14.250]
He had those big bulging eyes.

[02:34:14.430 --> 02:34:16.050]
You know, like a, like a, like a, buffo tot.

[02:34:16.350 --> 02:34:17.210]
Like a bullfrog.

[02:34:18.030 --> 02:34:18.830]
Eddie Cantor.

[02:34:18.850 --> 02:34:19.810]
Was he a talent or what?

[02:34:19.850 --> 02:34:19.970]
No.

[02:34:20.190 --> 02:34:22.050]
Man, he was, from the fall build days.

[02:34:22.810 --> 02:34:25.150]
See, in the early days, the television had to bring on all these

[02:34:25.650 --> 02:34:27.250]
vaudeville people and radio people.

[02:34:27.570 --> 02:34:29.050]
And they had this dearth of talent.

[02:34:29.190 --> 02:34:30.910]
Kind of like what we have in radio now in South Florida.

[02:34:31.230 --> 02:34:32.090]
A dearth of talent.

[02:34:33.110 --> 02:34:33.870]
A lot of crap.

[02:34:34.430 --> 02:34:35.490]
A lot of swill.

[02:34:35.950 --> 02:34:37.130]
It just breaks my heart.

[02:34:37.390 --> 02:34:39.370]
It's enough to make a grown man want to cry, you know.

[02:34:40.070 --> 02:34:42.490]
But then payday comes and I think, well, I ain't so bad, you know.

[02:34:44.070 --> 02:34:45.470]
Except when the check don't show up.

[02:34:46.230 --> 02:34:47.390]
It did show up early this time.

[02:34:47.510 --> 02:34:49.330]
Nice going fat ass, jolly joe, baby.

[02:34:49.630 --> 02:34:50.550]
Keep those checks coming.

[02:34:50.550 --> 02:34:52.730]
You still keep having all your buddies there from rolling.

[02:34:52.870 --> 02:34:53.350]
That's all right.

[02:34:54.790 --> 02:34:55.450]
10, 18.

[02:34:55.730 --> 02:34:57.110]
Only don't fire any more of our friends.

[02:34:57.270 --> 02:34:58.890]
Okay, fire somebody from one of the other shows.

[02:34:59.450 --> 02:35:00.570]
So you can bring your buddies in.

[02:35:00.790 --> 02:35:02.850]
Is the sales department on vacation all summer or what?

[02:35:03.050 --> 02:35:03.450]
Other than Duff.

[02:35:03.790 --> 02:35:06.270]
He's the only one he was in this morning before the show.

[02:35:07.870 --> 02:35:08.950]
And I said, hey, Duff.

[02:35:09.030 --> 02:35:09.450]
You're fair.

[02:35:09.510 --> 02:35:10.550]
And he turned around and ran out.

[02:35:10.610 --> 02:35:11.970]
But he came in.

[02:35:13.310 --> 02:35:15.690]
Big Brian there, Brian Schmutz.

[02:35:15.870 --> 02:35:17.030]
Is he still working there?

[02:35:18.490 --> 02:35:18.850]
Yeah.

[02:35:19.590 --> 02:35:19.810]
Yeah.

[02:35:20.330 --> 02:35:21.490]
I mean, he's still there.

[02:35:21.630 --> 02:35:22.270]
He's still collecting.

[02:35:22.570 --> 02:35:24.230]
I shouldn't see us in working, you know.

[02:35:24.470 --> 02:35:25.050]
Here are the heat games?

[02:35:25.490 --> 02:35:25.770]
No.

[02:35:26.930 --> 02:35:28.490]
So what does that have to do with our revenue?

[02:35:29.590 --> 02:35:33.070]
Well, we have that extended heat coverage and, you know, around the clock.

[02:35:33.430 --> 02:35:35.250]
You know, that's not what the article said.

[02:35:35.410 --> 02:35:38.750]
It's not because we didn't have any heat games to broadcast because they didn't make the playoffs.

[02:35:38.830 --> 02:35:40.230]
And that's the reason that the revenue was down.

[02:35:40.450 --> 02:35:42.150]
We don't carry the mommy heat on their station.

[02:35:42.210 --> 02:35:45.590]
We don't have the heat.

[02:35:46.310 --> 02:35:48.430]
We got the dolphins and we got the hooray keins.

[02:35:48.430 --> 02:35:50.190]
And W-I-O-D's got the heat.

[02:35:50.190 --> 02:35:51.070]
W-I-O-D.

[02:35:51.250 --> 02:35:52.250]
Oh, I hate that station.

[02:35:52.450 --> 02:35:53.290]
Well, what can I say?

[02:35:54.610 --> 02:35:56.090]
Is Disney still over there or was?

[02:35:56.150 --> 02:35:57.930]
Is he still, uh, I don't know.

[02:35:57.930 --> 02:35:59.290]
I think Red knows like WC feels.

[02:36:00.530 --> 02:36:02.330]
And what about your close personal friend, Cheryl?

[02:36:03.110 --> 02:36:03.570]
I don't know.

[02:36:03.830 --> 02:36:05.910]
You'll never guess who I had a call from the other day.

[02:36:06.830 --> 02:36:08.150]
I was sitting here minding my own business.

[02:36:08.690 --> 02:36:08.950]
Rimmer.

[02:36:09.390 --> 02:36:09.730]
Yeah.

[02:36:10.050 --> 02:36:10.530]
Good guess.

[02:36:10.810 --> 02:36:11.890]
Like I said, you'll never guess.

[02:36:12.070 --> 02:36:12.530]
What do I?

[02:36:12.670 --> 02:36:13.030]
Rimmer.

[02:36:13.170 --> 02:36:13.530]
What do I win?

[02:36:15.250 --> 02:36:18.250]
The best thing that ever happened to me is that he had a triple bypass.

[02:36:19.170 --> 02:36:20.770]
Because he wasn't asking for any free meal.

[02:36:20.850 --> 02:36:21.930]
Oh, we're in Toronto now.

[02:36:22.170 --> 02:36:24.630]
But for the weekend, whatever, you know, visiting their son.

[02:36:26.430 --> 02:36:29.150]
But didn't, you know, and didn't want any of my time.

[02:36:29.330 --> 02:36:31.050]
Because obviously he can't eat any free meals.

[02:36:31.290 --> 02:36:32.810]
Because he had a triple bypass.

[02:36:32.870 --> 02:36:34.330]
So he's on a real strict diet now.

[02:36:34.630 --> 02:36:35.250]
So he survived.

[02:36:35.410 --> 02:36:36.170]
He's doing just fine.

[02:36:36.430 --> 02:36:37.170]
He's still alive.

[02:36:37.450 --> 02:36:38.230]
He still hates the knees.

[02:36:38.230 --> 02:36:41.050]
He's spot that like poison and the Panther organization.

[02:36:44.210 --> 02:36:44.910]
And he called.

[02:36:45.150 --> 02:36:45.970]
It was all right.

[02:36:46.050 --> 02:36:46.930]
It was short enough of a call.

[02:36:47.130 --> 02:36:48.470]
I mean, don't call me anymore.

[02:36:48.590 --> 02:36:49.370]
Rimmer for a few months.

[02:36:51.470 --> 02:36:53.350]
Wasn't that good though that he had a triple bypass.

[02:36:53.690 --> 02:36:57.110]
And now he can't beat no big gut-wrenching stakes at Ruth Chris

[02:36:57.110 --> 02:36:58.090]
and cost me a lot of money.

[02:36:58.250 --> 02:36:58.430]
Yeah.

[02:36:58.530 --> 02:37:01.030]
What I discovered was my candy.

[02:37:02.090 --> 02:37:07.030]
My lesbian-eased terrorist cab driver was taking me somewhere where we were putting all that stuff together

[02:37:07.030 --> 02:37:10.070]
for the very expensive and traumatic birthday party I threw for my friend.

[02:37:10.770 --> 02:37:15.390]
And I noticed in the high-end hotel here, there's a gigantic Morton's stake house.

[02:37:17.890 --> 02:37:19.450]
Now, have you ever eaten in Morton's?

[02:37:20.710 --> 02:37:20.970]
Yes.

[02:37:22.490 --> 02:37:26.790]
Because our mutual friend, the professor, told me that Morton's was better than Ruth Chris.

[02:37:28.670 --> 02:37:30.130]
And I forget what you told me about.

[02:37:30.190 --> 02:37:31.670]
I know we have this discussion a million times.

[02:37:32.830 --> 02:37:34.250]
And what's your analization of it?

[02:37:35.910 --> 02:37:36.850]
I don't know.

[02:37:37.830 --> 02:37:38.670]
I like Ruth Chris better.

[02:37:38.670 --> 02:37:39.230]
You don't know?

[02:37:39.530 --> 02:37:39.770]
Ruth Chris.

[02:37:40.190 --> 02:37:40.990]
Ruth Chris better.

[02:37:43.790 --> 02:37:44.650]
I think I'm one thing.

[02:37:44.690 --> 02:37:46.390]
The Ruth Chris here in the Hilton Hotel.

[02:37:47.650 --> 02:37:51.670]
Which hotel did I say the Morton's is in the Hyatt?

[02:37:52.830 --> 02:37:54.770]
But Ruth Chris is in the Hilton Hotel here downtown.

[02:37:55.050 --> 02:37:57.310]
And man, it is because they're not all the same.

[02:37:58.330 --> 02:37:59.690]
They're definitely not all the same.

[02:38:00.330 --> 02:38:01.470]
I've eaten in the ones in Vegas.

[02:38:01.670 --> 02:38:02.190]
They're both great.

[02:38:02.190 --> 02:38:02.850]
They're two of them.

[02:38:03.290 --> 02:38:04.130]
At least they're used to be.

[02:38:05.150 --> 02:38:07.230]
And one here is just unbelievable.

[02:38:08.470 --> 02:38:10.930]
I haven't had a piece of meat in my mouth like that in well.

[02:38:11.950 --> 02:38:16.730]
Speaking of that reunion, see, that's another thing the reunion makes me very sad.

[02:38:16.890 --> 02:38:21.290]
Because it makes me think of all the opportunities, the missed opportunities back in those days when I was covering in the closet.

[02:38:21.650 --> 02:38:23.650]
Oh, you don't want to associate with those via me, you know?

[02:38:24.650 --> 02:38:26.270]
What kind of an upbringing was that, you know?

[02:38:26.570 --> 02:38:31.070]
To sluck me to a town when all the people there were going and you don't want to socialize with them.

[02:38:31.070 --> 02:38:32.670]
In some other words, you socialize with yourself.

[02:38:34.810 --> 02:38:35.570]
You know what I'm saying?

[02:38:35.950 --> 02:38:36.850]
Right? Happens all the time?

[02:38:37.330 --> 02:38:37.750]
Not good.

[02:38:38.690 --> 02:38:40.770]
So all you Jews out there, don't move to some door.

[02:38:41.010 --> 02:38:43.370]
Don't just let your kids to some little town where it is all going.

[02:38:43.630 --> 02:38:45.830]
And then tell them, tell them you can't associate with the go-am.

[02:38:47.390 --> 02:38:48.830]
Because they're going to be anti-social.

[02:38:48.950 --> 02:38:50.450]
They're going to be bourgeois all hell.

[02:38:50.730 --> 02:38:53.210]
And they're going to have a personality like a dead man, like me.

[02:38:55.650 --> 02:38:57.230]
20-till-two at QAM.

[02:38:57.890 --> 02:38:59.430]
What are we going to do about Brian Schmutz?

[02:38:59.430 --> 02:39:02.350]
So we're going to, like, maybe we can get a package deal for Chris.

[02:39:02.450 --> 02:39:03.870]
Because he's already going to co-clearance.

[02:39:04.390 --> 02:39:06.370]
I forget who else I told him to kill this morning.

[02:39:06.650 --> 02:39:08.470]
But certainly, Brian Schmutz has got to be on the list.

[02:39:09.050 --> 02:39:10.170]
It was just salesman, I think.

[02:39:11.410 --> 02:39:12.190]
No whole sales department?

[02:39:12.530 --> 02:39:12.870]
All right.

[02:39:14.170 --> 02:39:14.510]
Deal?

[02:39:15.170 --> 02:39:15.570]
God?

[02:39:16.370 --> 02:39:19.710]
The honorable mayor of Fort Waterdale, Jim Nogel.

[02:39:20.430 --> 02:39:21.070]
Thank you.

[02:39:22.070 --> 02:39:26.950]
I was proud of Mike Rusay to eliminate the great community to make my world safer for Jesus.

[02:39:26.950 --> 02:39:31.270]
I'm pleased to be here today for the unveiling of our new robotic toilet.

[02:39:31.650 --> 02:39:36.310]
I give you the RoboTronic KY69 toilet stall.

[02:39:55.630 --> 02:39:59.570]
It is my privilege to be the first ones in Christendom.

[02:39:59.570 --> 02:40:00.590]
I feel this, excuse me.

[02:40:00.590 --> 02:40:03.750]
Oh, this is nice.

[02:40:04.350 --> 02:40:05.550]
Not a whole moment, say.

[02:40:06.330 --> 02:40:08.310]
Welcome to the KY69 toilet facility.

[02:40:08.850 --> 02:40:09.290]
For you.

[02:40:09.690 --> 02:40:10.730]
I am Saybar.

[02:40:11.050 --> 02:40:12.030]
You'll know what I'm going to like.

[02:40:12.370 --> 02:40:13.750]
Allow me to assist you.

[02:40:14.030 --> 02:40:15.370]
I don't need any help, thanks.

[02:40:15.590 --> 02:40:16.850]
I know how to use the toilet.

[02:40:17.070 --> 02:40:18.910]
You have two seconds to remove your pants.

[02:40:19.350 --> 02:40:19.530]
What?

[02:40:21.030 --> 02:40:21.290]
Hey!

[02:40:21.670 --> 02:40:22.610]
Sit down, please.

[02:40:23.130 --> 02:40:23.530]
What?

[02:40:24.170 --> 02:40:25.590]
Would you like to support Dave?

[02:40:25.930 --> 02:40:26.150]
No.

[02:40:26.510 --> 02:40:28.950]
The sport page is the central for a healthy male dog.

[02:40:28.950 --> 02:40:31.570]
You have two seconds to remove your pants.

[02:40:31.570 --> 02:40:32.790]
I did not hear a noise.

[02:40:33.370 --> 02:40:34.210]
I can't.

[02:40:34.530 --> 02:40:35.950]
This is the case of the patient.

[02:40:36.510 --> 02:40:38.050]
And overplayed.

[02:40:38.210 --> 02:40:40.210]
I'm not initiating voice in very Emma.

[02:40:46.210 --> 02:40:48.430]
I'm not initiating Alex Garob.

[02:40:51.350 --> 02:40:53.970]
I'm not initiating Alex Garob.

[02:40:54.270 --> 02:40:55.550]
I'm not sitting back down.

[02:40:56.190 --> 02:40:56.990]
I'm not.

[02:40:56.990 --> 02:40:58.090]
I'm not initiating Alex Garob.

[02:40:58.810 --> 02:41:01.250]
And by the way, if it comes from China, throw it down the toilet.

[02:41:02.070 --> 02:41:03.990]
Just in general, whatever it might be.

[02:41:04.670 --> 02:41:05.030]
Right.

[02:41:06.510 --> 02:41:06.870]
147.

[02:41:06.930 --> 02:41:07.690]
Or 560.

[02:41:07.790 --> 02:41:08.230]
I'm going to queue him.

[02:41:08.350 --> 02:41:09.050]
It's Woodbine Tuesday.

[02:41:11.770 --> 02:41:12.550]
Shocked, didn't I?

[02:41:13.870 --> 02:41:14.790]
A little bit, yeah.

[02:41:15.570 --> 02:41:16.310]
Why is that?

[02:41:17.430 --> 02:41:18.610]
Because it's usually Wednesday?

[02:41:19.170 --> 02:41:20.310]
Well, it's Woodbine Tuesday.

[02:41:20.530 --> 02:41:21.710]
Why the hell would I want to go on a Wednesday?

[02:41:22.170 --> 02:41:23.630]
Maybe I'll find me a good machine month.

[02:41:23.630 --> 02:41:26.110]
Or maybe there'll be another bag later to win a big jackpot.

[02:41:28.750 --> 02:41:32.290]
If you could have seen these shrines and the carrying on I was going on with that old bag,

[02:41:32.930 --> 02:41:33.570]
100 grand.

[02:41:33.750 --> 02:41:34.990]
I mean, yeah, what are you going to do?

[02:41:36.110 --> 02:41:37.530]
Well, what does it have to do with me?

[02:41:37.690 --> 02:41:38.390]
Why should I care?

[02:41:38.550 --> 02:41:38.990]
Do I care?

[02:41:39.390 --> 02:41:40.750]
I mean, sure I would like to have had it myself.

[02:41:41.210 --> 02:41:42.730]
Why should I get all whipped up into a frenzy?

[02:41:44.350 --> 02:41:44.670]
Depart.

[02:41:44.950 --> 02:41:47.190]
Why is it that there's so many adults who are like little children?

[02:41:48.730 --> 02:41:50.350]
I'd throw a fine brick, for example.

[02:41:50.490 --> 02:41:52.170]
I always cry and bellyache.

[02:41:53.130 --> 02:41:57.270]
Which is what with large swaths of the Gulf Coast still in ruins from Hurricane Katrina,

[02:41:57.730 --> 02:41:59.030]
this article will piss you off.

[02:41:59.770 --> 02:42:03.850]
Rich federal tax breaks designed a spur rebuilding are flowing hundreds of miles inland

[02:42:03.850 --> 02:42:08.330]
to investors who are buying up luxury condos near the University of Alabama's football stadium.

[02:42:10.010 --> 02:42:13.350]
About 10 condominium projects are going up in and around Tuscaloosa,

[02:42:13.690 --> 02:42:16.850]
and builders are asking up to a million dollars for units with granted countertops,

[02:42:17.270 --> 02:42:22.150]
king size bathtubs and Bama Day Corps, including crimson couches and bear Bryant wall art.

[02:42:24.030 --> 02:42:27.330]
While many of the buyers are crimson title of Nioh Arden football fans,

[02:42:27.430 --> 02:42:30.170]
not in total any special Katrina related tax breaks,

[02:42:30.470 --> 02:42:32.910]
many others are really interested in investors who are purchasing the condos,

[02:42:33.150 --> 02:42:34.090]
with plans to rent them out.

[02:42:35.070 --> 02:42:38.570]
And they intend to fully take advantage of the generous tax benefits available to investors.

[02:42:38.930 --> 02:42:42.130]
Under the Gulf Opportunities own Act of 2005 or GOZONE,

[02:42:43.110 --> 02:42:47.430]
the GOZONE contains a variety of tax breaks designed to stimulate construction in Mississippi,

[02:42:47.430 --> 02:42:49.050]
Louisiana and Alabama.

[02:42:49.810 --> 02:42:53.650]
It offers tax-free bonds to developers to finance big commercial projects like

[02:42:53.650 --> 02:42:55.670]
shopping centers, hotels, etc.

[02:42:55.970 --> 02:42:59.230]
It also allows real estate investors who buy condos or other properties in the GOZONE

[02:42:59.230 --> 02:43:02.590]
to take accelerated appreciation on the purchases when they file their taxes.

[02:43:04.070 --> 02:43:07.050]
The GOZONE was drawn to include the Tuscaloosa area,

[02:43:07.230 --> 02:43:08.850]
even though it's about 200 miles from the coast,

[02:43:09.190 --> 02:43:11.630]
and got only heavy rain and scattered wind damage from Katrina.

[02:43:12.950 --> 02:43:14.510]
The combo deals are perfectly legal,

[02:43:14.630 --> 02:43:16.750]
and the tax breaks don't take money away from Katrina victims

[02:43:16.750 --> 02:43:20.410]
closer to the coast because the appreciation is wide open with no limits per state.

[02:43:20.850 --> 02:43:23.910]
But the tax breaks are going to some community leaders,

[02:43:23.910 --> 02:43:25.890]
especially when red tape in this organization

[02:43:25.890 --> 02:43:28.850]
have stimulated rebuilding in some of the devastated coastal areas.

[02:43:29.930 --> 02:43:32.010]
The GOZONE extends so damn far,

[02:43:32.210 --> 02:43:35.010]
but the people who really need the help most can't take advantage of it,

[02:43:35.070 --> 02:43:37.450]
said John Herell, a lawyer in Harthead Gulf for Mississippi.

[02:43:38.490 --> 02:43:41.330]
It's a joke said Tuscaloosa developers stand pate,

[02:43:41.530 --> 02:43:43.870]
who has nevertheless used GOZONE tax breaks on projects

[02:43:43.870 --> 02:43:45.410]
and include a new hotel in a restaurant.

[02:43:45.410 --> 02:43:48.350]
It was supposed to be about getting people to put housing into Orleans,

[02:43:48.830 --> 02:43:49.930]
Louisiana, or velocity in Mississippi.

[02:43:50.150 --> 02:43:52.090]
It wasn't about condos in Tuscaloosa.

[02:43:53.590 --> 02:43:58.210]
Locals say Tuscaloosa was included in the GOZONE through the efforts of Republican Senator Richard Shelby,

[02:43:58.210 --> 02:44:00.550]
who is from Tuscaloosa, graduated from Alabama,

[02:44:01.150 --> 02:44:02.910]
and sits on the Powerful Appropriations Committee.

[02:44:04.870 --> 02:44:06.110]
But a beep bit of boop bit of up.

[02:44:06.250 --> 02:44:07.710]
So there you go, your government in action again.

[02:44:11.510 --> 02:44:12.650]
And you know what they say?

[02:44:13.410 --> 02:44:14.130]
What are they saying?

[02:44:14.550 --> 02:44:15.090]
George W.

[02:44:15.410 --> 02:44:16.170]
Oh, here it is.

[02:44:16.410 --> 02:44:18.450]
George Bush doesn't care about black people.

[02:44:18.810 --> 02:44:19.910]
Or white people either, right?

[02:44:20.010 --> 02:44:20.510]
Or any people.

[02:44:21.350 --> 02:44:23.030]
Anybody that isn't one of his, you know,

[02:44:23.330 --> 02:44:23.470]
Yelp.

[02:44:24.010 --> 02:44:26.230]
Yelp, ass lacquers, things like that.

[02:44:27.310 --> 02:44:28.310]
All of these things.

[02:44:29.570 --> 02:44:30.550]
1028, that's great.

[02:44:30.930 --> 02:44:32.910]
2020, almost everybody's got at least one vote,

[02:44:32.970 --> 02:44:34.250]
favorite Jewish comedian of all time.

[02:44:34.950 --> 02:44:37.930]
Adam Sandberg, Paul Reiser, Bobby Reiser,

[02:44:39.190 --> 02:44:41.970]
Seppo Marx, Charles Rodin, the anxious one,

[02:44:42.030 --> 02:44:45.090]
and Eddie Cantor have none, out of 1034 now.

[02:44:45.650 --> 02:44:46.450]
They still have none.

[02:44:47.870 --> 02:44:50.730]
Isn't that a real shot when you can't get one vote out of over a thousand?

[02:44:52.510 --> 02:44:53.530]
Even you would feel bad.

[02:44:54.070 --> 02:44:55.430]
If we had like a Paul saying,

[02:44:55.730 --> 02:44:58.310]
what was your favorite talk personality on QAIM?

[02:44:58.550 --> 02:44:59.510]
And you didn't get one vote?

[02:45:00.650 --> 02:45:02.330]
Wouldn't you feel like crap?

[02:45:02.590 --> 02:45:02.730]
No.

[02:45:03.550 --> 02:45:04.210]
Yeah, you would.

[02:45:05.370 --> 02:45:05.990]
What happened?

[02:45:06.490 --> 02:45:06.810]
Huh?

[02:45:07.050 --> 02:45:08.010]
It wouldn't happen, but no.

[02:45:08.110 --> 02:45:08.950]
No, it would not happen.

[02:45:09.610 --> 02:45:11.090]
That's what I'm trying to say to you.

[02:45:11.630 --> 02:45:13.370]
Of course, there's eight million names on here.

[02:45:13.430 --> 02:45:15.530]
Now maybe some people like Paul Reiser,

[02:45:15.710 --> 02:45:17.030]
they just can't pronounce his name, you know?

[02:45:18.150 --> 02:45:20.930]
Or maybe some people like me haven't got any idea who the hell he is.

[02:45:21.370 --> 02:45:22.570]
Am I supposed to know who he is?

[02:45:24.130 --> 02:45:27.850]
No, only if you go to comedy movies in the past, I don't know, 50 years.

[02:45:29.550 --> 02:45:30.650]
And what was the end?

[02:45:31.930 --> 02:45:32.750]
Oh, this one and that one?

[02:45:34.190 --> 02:45:35.290]
I said 50 years.

[02:45:35.450 --> 02:45:37.030]
I mean, he hasn't been big in a while.

[02:45:37.210 --> 02:45:37.710]
He's already old.

[02:45:37.790 --> 02:45:37.910]
Yeah.

[02:45:39.910 --> 02:45:41.290]
I haven't been big in a while either.

[02:45:42.810 --> 02:45:44.190]
I bet you don't know about this story.

[02:45:44.310 --> 02:45:45.810]
In fact, I bet you almost nobody knows about it

[02:45:45.810 --> 02:45:47.290]
because it's one of the best kept secrets going

[02:45:47.290 --> 02:45:48.390]
and probably nothing's going to happen.

[02:45:49.710 --> 02:45:52.830]
A general strike has proposed for the US on September 11th

[02:45:52.830 --> 02:45:54.630]
is the 6th anniversary of 9-11 attacks.

[02:45:55.870 --> 02:45:58.010]
The general strike movement has no clearly named leadership

[02:45:58.010 --> 02:46:00.290]
if it's described as an internet viral effort.

[02:46:02.090 --> 02:46:03.610]
General strikes, more common in Europe,

[02:46:03.690 --> 02:46:05.210]
are events that shut down the normal operations

[02:46:05.210 --> 02:46:06.950]
of a city-state or nation for very good time.

[02:46:07.450 --> 02:46:09.270]
These strikes aim to force awareness and action

[02:46:09.270 --> 02:46:11.250]
on a single issue or broader set of concerns.

[02:46:11.730 --> 02:46:14.130]
The 9-11 general strike has a central location,

[02:46:16.410 --> 02:46:18.790]
www.strike911.org on the internet,

[02:46:19.150 --> 02:46:21.590]
which is linked to and reproduced on a variety of other internet sites.

[02:46:21.930 --> 02:46:23.730]
The site states the rationale for the effort.

[02:46:24.890 --> 02:46:26.810]
The general strike is a national call to action

[02:46:26.810 --> 02:46:28.470]
from citizens to other citizens.

[02:46:28.470 --> 02:46:29.690]
It's not about a single issue.

[02:46:30.090 --> 02:46:32.410]
It's not an anti-war protest, a civil rights protest,

[02:46:32.670 --> 02:46:33.770]
an election fraud protest.

[02:46:34.130 --> 02:46:34.930]
It's not about torture.

[02:46:35.290 --> 02:46:36.810]
It's not about surveillance, corporate media,

[02:46:36.950 --> 02:46:38.350]
the 9-11 cover-up or the environment.

[02:46:38.750 --> 02:46:40.550]
The strike is about all of these issues and more.

[02:46:40.750 --> 02:46:41.510]
All of these things.

[02:46:41.830 --> 02:46:42.830]
We all have different concerns,

[02:46:42.850 --> 02:46:44.210]
but we all have the same concern.

[02:46:44.550 --> 02:46:47.030]
We are being lied to in this government doesn't represent us.

[02:46:47.950 --> 02:46:49.810]
Join other Americans in demanding truth justice

[02:46:49.810 --> 02:46:50.410]
and accountability.

[02:46:50.970 --> 02:46:52.910]
This is our country and our world and we have to stand up.

[02:46:53.010 --> 02:46:55.470]
A national call to action Tuesday, September 11th, 2007.

[02:46:56.110 --> 02:46:58.990]
No school, no work, buy nothing, hit the streets.

[02:46:59.470 --> 02:47:03.030]
Should we probably put a link to that on our NeoRodgers.com?

[02:47:04.090 --> 02:47:04.690]
If you want.

[02:47:06.330 --> 02:47:07.510]
www.strike911.org.

[02:47:07.690 --> 02:47:09.170]
I'm just mentioning that in passing.

[02:47:09.250 --> 02:47:11.370]
I don't want to make a lot of work for like Eric or anybody like that.

[02:47:11.590 --> 02:47:12.910]
Or certainly not for Josh Cortes.

[02:47:13.850 --> 02:47:16.710]
Because he's got enough work on his hands just getting his Russian girlfriend back.

[02:47:20.230 --> 02:47:21.410]
Wax solid.

[02:47:22.570 --> 02:47:25.650]
It's day high in Miami town.

[02:47:26.510 --> 02:47:30.070]
At 560 WQA.

[02:47:31.830 --> 02:47:32.930]
All right.

[02:47:35.590 --> 02:47:36.750]
Sports boards.

[02:47:37.050 --> 02:47:37.630]
Sports boards.

[02:47:37.870 --> 02:47:38.430]

[02:47:42.810 --> 02:47:43.350]
Sports boards.

[02:47:44.670 --> 02:47:45.930]
I like reading the sports section.

[02:47:47.830 --> 02:47:49.790]
Yeah, the paper is better news in a computer.

[02:47:50.090 --> 02:47:51.390]
You can read the paper on a toilet.

[02:47:51.670 --> 02:47:52.770]
Yeah, I don't like computers.

[02:47:53.030 --> 02:47:55.150]
Because what's I got to do with sports?

[02:47:56.230 --> 02:47:56.330]
Sports boards.

[02:47:56.450 --> 02:47:57.090]

[02:48:03.610 --> 02:48:04.750]
We got a girl in here.

[02:48:05.070 --> 02:48:06.710]
Yeah, a girl.

[02:48:07.090 --> 02:48:07.430]
Hello.

[02:48:07.810 --> 02:48:09.030]
See? We're straight.

[02:48:09.370 --> 02:48:10.250]
That's a girl.

[02:48:11.110 --> 02:48:12.010]
Girls are okay.

[02:48:12.290 --> 02:48:15.030]
But I'd rather stare blankly ahead and just talk about sports.

[02:48:15.030 --> 02:48:15.610]
Sports boards.

[02:48:15.790 --> 02:48:16.410]
Spice boards.

[02:48:16.730 --> 02:48:18.130]

[02:48:25.430 --> 02:48:29.350]
So hard to believe or lose an ab �whe and show its face.

[02:48:29.630 --> 02:48:34.550]
Just got to be somebody out there that wants to hear about nothing but sports boards.

[02:48:34.570 --> 02:48:35.390]
Sports boards.

[02:48:36.010 --> 02:48:36.570]
