[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.240]
Me and God.

[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.200]
First, let me be clear.

[00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:05.800]
I am gay.

[00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:07.540]
I have been gay.

[00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:08.180]
All right.

[00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.000]
Furthermore, I love sex.

[00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:16.120]
Because of that, I will seek inappropriate conduct

[00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.660]
at the Minneapolis Airport or anywhere else.

[00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.320]
Again, I am gay.

[00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.740]
And I should have told my family and my friends about it.

[00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.960]
I should not have kept my wife because I am gay.

[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.020]
I'm coming out today.

[00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.280]
I hope you appreciate my openness to all of you.

[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:39.720]
Thank you very much.

[00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.400]
Thank you, Senator, former Senator.

[00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.560]
Well, he's intending to resign and intending to stay around

[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.820]
and intending to get all the action you possibly can.

[00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:46.980]
Gay.

[00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:47.820]
Of that variety.

[00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.420]
10, 1, and 5, 60, W.C.M.

[00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.480]
So who was that guy?

[00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:52.280]
Keith Jackson.

[00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.880]
That came in this morning and produced himself.

[00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.320]
That was Jason Jackson Miller.

[00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.660]
And I said, boy, heck of a job in the exercise.

[00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.060]
One of my favorite scenes of all time was when...

[00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.460]
Demi, what do you do this to me?

[00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:08.160]
I'm afraid.

[00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:09.880]
Please, Demi.

[00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.200]
I'm afraid.

[00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.520]
And now let's see.

[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:14.920]
What's the rejoin one we're going to?

[00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:16.440]
Come out.

[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:17.600]
I'm not every break.

[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.220]
They're going to be doing some jingles today because I don't have

[00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.420]
a disc with a new bad voice.

[00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.780]
Because clearance can't get his act together.

[00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.500]
And clearance even got George Rodriguez on the schedule today.

[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:28.600]
He tend to do never change it.

[00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:29.160]
Here's George.

[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.720]
Don't go getting many ideas.

[00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.060]
You know, let's show you how sick the media is.

[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:35.340]
And how full of crap.

[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.980]
The sun settles and the story about the DJM's Kennedy finally

[00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.420]
croaking to which we say, oh, you owe me a great

[00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.460]
photograph.

[00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.140]
I do appreciate it.

[00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.920]
You won't believe you're having no idea.

[00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.960]
And your vast audience of one kids out there

[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.640]
weren't even calling you to tell you, hey, guess what?

[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:54.840]
The old and the old and the old and the old and the old.

[00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.320]
Nobody did.

[00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.520]
You were the only one standing by his hospital bed holding his hand.

[00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.500]
But anyway, the headline in the sun sent a says,

[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.540]
Kennedy remembered his pioneering evangelical minister.

[00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.240]
Oh my God.

[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.760]
Is this talk about sucking ass?

[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.580]
Jesus God sucking dead ass no less.

[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.480]
Yikes.

[00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.300]
Even quasi-motor would be embarrassed.

[00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.600]
Now that's just pathetic.

[00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.400]
Kennedy remembered his, it should say.

[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.640]
Kennedy remembered his bigoted hateful son of a bitch.

[00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:22.700]
That would be more appropriate.

[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:24.400]
The James Kennedy.

[00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:25.700]
He croaked in case you missed it.

[00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:26.360]
Oh, he's right.

[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:27.060]
The town he's dead.

[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.320]
First year he fall well and now this son of a bitch and then

[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:31.560]
maybe Pat Robertson next.

[00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:32.600]
What a year it'll be.

[00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.220]
I don't forget what it all three in the same year.

[00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:35.740]
And then maybe what's the other one's name?

[00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:36.220]
Dobson.

[00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:37.140]
Yeah.

[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.920]
James Dobson.

[00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:39.500]
There's another one.

[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:40.080]
We can pray.

[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:41.520]
We can only hope.

[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:42.680]
Oh, poverty is dead.

[00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:43.120]
Yeah.

[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.440]
Being competition by each.

[00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:46.860]
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.540]
Pollyarchy.

[00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:48.040]
Yeah.

[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.620]
I still I don't understand why anybody listens to that.

[00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:51.640]
Why anybody watches it?

[00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.360]
It's just I don't get it.

[00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:54.780]
I'm just not a suit.

[00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.680]
I do have to be a suit to go to the opera.

[00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:57.720]
It helps.

[00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.620]
Yeah.

[00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.560]
Famed opera tenor Luciano Pavarote appeared on stage with singers

[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.880]
is very to superstar.

[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.900]
Dame Jones Sutherland, you choose Bono and Liza Manelli.

[00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:11.300]
Liza Manelli.

[00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:12.300]
Oh my God.

[00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.560]
Died today in Italy after suffering from pancreatic cancer,

[00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:17.740]
manager Tim Terry Roffson said in the statement.

[00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.240]
He was 71 and fat.

[00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:22.440]
Big and fat.

[00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:23.820]
Huge and fat.

[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.920]
The great tenor Luciano Pavarote died today at five in the morning

[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.740]
in this home in Modena of the city of his birth quarter,

[00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:30.160]
Roffson.

[00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:34.060]
The Maestro fought a long tough battle against the pancreatic cancer,

[00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.340]
which eventually took his life.

[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.680]
The portly singer see that that's portly.

[00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.720]
Yeah, that that's like the other headline about DJ and Kennedy

[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.280]
sending the big gigantic fat cow singer retired from stage

[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.740]
and offering 2004 was on a farewell tour of concerts when he was

[00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.680]
diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2006.

[00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.840]
Not only emergency surgery to remove the to to to to to to to to to to to to to

[00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:54.920]
tumor.

[00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.220]
Although the remaining conscience of his tour were canceled,

[00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.860]
the management said he had hoped to resume the tour in 2007.

[00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.760]
Guess what?

[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.240]
Surprise ain't going to happen.

[00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.900]
He's dead.

[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.640]
Right.

[00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:06.440]
That's bad.

[00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:11.200]
Much is the star power of Rudolph Nureev and Mikhail Barishnikov

[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.740]
received widespread interest in classical ballet in the 70s and eighties.

[00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.900]
Pavarote, these beaming charisma and bravorist style can't for the

[00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.300]
attention to late 20th century audience for opera.

[00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:21.040]
All ten of them.

[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.100]
There he is for me.

[00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:27.220]
My profession is to try to be in the best like I've always done.

[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.680]
Yeah, go have some more pasta and they get back in the box.

[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:30.880]
Okay, back in the box.

[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.340]
Here's a Georgia's pool from yesterday boy 378 votes.

[00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:37.520]
What kind of a number is that?

[00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:38.760]
Well, it's not really late.

[00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.040]
I mean, no, this is such a bad poll.

[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.820]
Come on.

[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:43.180]
Started late.

[00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:44.260]
My fat ass.

[00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:45.380]
Yeah, that's true.

[00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.500]
This could be the worst pool you've ever taken.

[00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.420]
What should Chris's nickname be?

[00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:50.760]
Right.

[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.880]
What kind of a poll question is that?

[00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:54.760]
I think it's important.

[00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:55.920]
It's one of the most important polls.

[00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:59.140]
Well, the audience didn't that's obvious that 378 votes.

[00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:00.480]
He shouldn't have one on grenade.

[00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.940]
You see when he shouldn't have one wins.

[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:03.660]
Uh huh.

[00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.320]
That's not a really good indication that they're all whipped up about.

[00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:07.780]
You know, they don't care about Chris.

[00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:08.720]
Exactly.

[00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:10.720]
With all due respect, I don't say that.

[00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.400]
You know, it's not a shot, but they just don't care that much.

[00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:13.740]
I know.

[00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:15.960]
Chris P. cream 78.

[00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:16.560]
Isn't that cute?

[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:17.220]
That is cute.

[00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:17.420]
No.

[00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:19.780]
Fat Chris 34.

[00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.240]
Pinky 34.

[00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:23.100]
Longhead 32.

[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:23.780]
That was my vote.

[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:24.200]
Longhead.

[00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:28.040]
I think that says it all ballpark Frank 31.

[00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:29.400]
I don't even understand that.

[00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:31.320]
They plump when you cook them.

[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:32.680]
They're plump.

[00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:33.280]
They lung.

[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.920]
Strike 29.

[00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:37.140]
The fat dog 19 and 413.

[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:38.140]
That's not bad.

[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:38.740]
The fat dog.

[00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.240]
We got the gay dog.

[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:40.780]
Little dog.

[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:41.260]
The big dog.

[00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:41.840]
The mad dog.

[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:43.520]
That's the sports for a man.

[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:44.440]
A bunch of stupid crafts.

[00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:45.800]
So I heard.

[00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:47.940]
We all had excuses this morning.

[00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.140]
George had some volcanic ball movements.

[00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:50.840]
Oh, yeah.

[00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:51.940]
On the throne is low.

[00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:52.240]
So.

[00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.800]
And I had to take my little Mexican buddy to the dentist,

[00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.340]
which, you know,

[00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:57.720]
oh, yeah.

[00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.820]
Oh, brother, which he's got all kinds of cavities.

[00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:04.180]
So they must have some tremendous practitioners in Latin America.

[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:06.240]
Yeah, I heard they have all kinds of cavities down there.

[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:10.060]
What are you trying to say back home, but at any rate?

[00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:12.700]
And so I'm Chris had some other way.

[00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:13.560]
He's got a cool.

[00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:14.100]
He's sick.

[00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:14.560]
He's going.

[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:15.140]
Correct.

[00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:18.300]
So he was out buying like crap, you know, drugs.

[00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.700]
And so everybody was in late this morning.

[00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:28.220]
And if we would have been smart, we wouldn't have come in at all.

[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.960]
But anyway, I got a chance to hear some of the Joe and what's the guy's name?

[00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.120]
Show Jason Jackson.

[00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:37.520]
And love having Joe back in Jason came in and said,

[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.000]
hi and kiss my ass for a little bit this morning before the show.

[00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:44.640]
But oh, so many spots.

[00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:46.020]
No wonder Joe is screaming.

[00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:47.540]
You'd be screaming too.

[00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:51.140]
And this is a member when we first came there, he was screaming at Duff screaming

[00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:53.820]
and yelling, oh, these spots is for bed.

[00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:54.900]
How could we get any rate?

[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:55.520]
Remember that?

[00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:59.060]
And now he's involved in the same thing.

[00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:01.900]
So George told me many ago that before before the show today,

[00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:06.060]
he was in the manager yesterday yesterday and ran into the fat Ray Perry,

[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:10.660]
who I still don't know what it is that he does there besides get the doff and tickets for everybody.

[00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:13.080]
And if this is official title of smooth here,

[00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:15.460]
and officially his Greg reads official schmoozer,

[00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:21.580]
rhymes with loser, among other things, and any rate ran in him in the tea room and racing.

[00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:23.400]
So what does Neil think about the new morning show?

[00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:26.080]
And George said, what did he say?

[00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:30.500]
I said, he said that they're overloading it with spots just like they did for the first thing.

[00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:31.580]
They're going to destroy it.

[00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:32.500]
They're going to destroy their ratings.

[00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:34.340]
You're not going to have a rating number that you can sell,

[00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:36.520]
but you people don't care about that because your penny wise and pound foolish.

[00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:37.600]
And he went.

[00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:40.100]
And that was it.

[00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:43.460]
Yeah, that was really an extent of the conversation.

[00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:45.000]
Or less, yeah.

[00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:45.860]
Wow.

[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:49.900]
And he said, you just wait till those other 10 sports stations come on here,

[00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:52.820]
but anyway to boil it all down to capitalize it for you,

[00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:54.680]
those of you who may be missing some of this for shows.

[00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:57.260]
What it's all about is this.

[00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:00.500]
Can the cane score enough points to win this game?

[00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:03.100]
And how many games old dolphins win this season?

[00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:03.780]
And then that's it.

[00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:05.060]
So you need to know.

[00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:07.380]
So I saved you a lot of time.

[00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:11.320]
I'm not just talking about a misdemeanor talking about across the street.

[00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:14.900]
All these sports shows, local, local, that's all they know from every call.

[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:15.620]
That's it.

[00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:20.420]
Can the canes do this and can the canes do that and will adopt and how many games they win?

[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:22.100]
I think they're going 10 and 6.

[00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:27.380]
6 out of 13 votes since we're so number intensive,

[00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:29.600]
we ought to get that numbers guy all whipped up to a frenzy.

[00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:31.460]
The one you're just mailing it in that guy.

[00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:32.960]
All you do is talk about numbers.

[00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:36.260]
Well, I see some good numbers here every day.

[00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:37.240]
I'll take it out right now.

[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:37.600]

[00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:38.240]
Warming it out.

[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:42.360]
I think to myself just because I'm fat and old and ugly and you know, and disgusting.

[00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:48.440]
Why won't you just let me come up to you and stick my tongue down your throat and give you a big kiss and a hug and take you home?

[00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:51.200]
You know, don't we all think that all the time?

[00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:54.100]
And we'll never stop and think about the fact they're looking at us thinking,

[00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:55.260]
oh, look at that.

[00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:57.080]
You know, I know disgusting faggot.

[00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:57.360]
Sure.

[00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:00.760]
Well, they don't think that, but whatever they think in my case, you know.

[00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:00.940]
Yeah.

[00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:04.500]
And I'm thinking, Jesus, God, come on home with me and let's have a good time.

[00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:05.720]
Here's the poll.

[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:08.660]
Who is your least favorite to party QM host?

[00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:11.500]
Now we did the one about the one you missed the most on Tuesday.

[00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:13.360]
Here's the one you missed the least.

[00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:15.680]
Mohawar David had winning in a landslide.

[00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:16.660]
170.

[00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:20.200]
That guy that called yesterday, you know, our Tuesday, you know that had to be bogus.

[00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:23.440]
I mean, even Joel Feinberg isn't stupid enough to hire him.

[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:24.300]
Right.

[00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:25.240]
Remember that guy?

[00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:27.740]
Oh, it says on it, you know, it doesn't say anywhere, okay?

[00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:30.060]
Although I think it's a great idea.

[00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:34.180]
If I'm Joel, I hire a mole right now, put him on from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m.

[00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:38.860]
All of the above 137, in other words, a Hubsay All-Andreer.

[00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:40.080]
I don't miss any of them.

[00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:40.960]
137.

[00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:43.340]
Scott Farell, 77.

[00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:44.900]
Missed him the least.

[00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:48.360]
Goli 73, the Crow 48.

[00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:50.080]
Kenny Walker, 37.

[00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:54.780]
For guy who was only there for a cup of coffee, man, he sure pissed off a lot of people, including me.

[00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:57.180]
That was the worst piece of crap.

[00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:05.520]
Anyway, D428, Mark Eisenberg 21, Ron Hershey 16, your least favorite, and Joe Castello 16.

[00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:09.440]
Who had all those bogus votes on Tuesday?

[00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:11.440]
What did he ever wind up with, you know?

[00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:12.560]
I don't know.

[00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:15.060]
A staggering number of phony votes.

[00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:18.880]
And I just had the feeling that he was sitting there, you know, he's got a lot of time on his hand.

[00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:20.720]
How often does he do that show on XM?

[00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:23.060]
Every day, every weekday, I believe.

[00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:24.220]
He does?

[00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:25.520]
Every evening, Friday.

[00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:26.240]
Right.

[00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:28.600]
On XM?

[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:29.220]
Are you sure?

[00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:30.800]
Yes, I'm saying we can get going.

[00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:33.180]
So he's actually got like a real job, you know, still.

[00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:35.320]
Maybe that's what he's about to know.

[00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:37.460]
There's phony or butt-sucking phone calls anymore.

[00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:37.800]
God.

[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:39.340]
I like you, Joe.

[00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:41.040]
You're a good guy, but don't ever call me again.

[00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:42.700]
Oh, you want to be on XM?

[00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:53.040]
And then of course, it comes back to me with the follow-up call saying, oh, well, they don't feel that the truck drivers that they're appealing to on XM radio want to hear some fat, fat,

[00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:56.240]
like you are talking, not can religion and God and stuff like that.

[00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:57.260]
And I said, oh, okay.

[00:10:57.980 --> 00:10:58.660]
No problem.

[00:10:58.920 --> 00:10:59.720]
I won't take it personal.

[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:03.040]
12 out of 10 at 560 WDQM.

[00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:04.100]
Here's our schedule today.

[00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:07.380]
I'm assuming the rest of the day the schedule is correct because it's got you on 10 to 2.

[00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:10.460]
Clarence can't even do something as simple as this without screwing it all up.

[00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:11.540]
He is the screw-meister.

[00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:15.920]
Mad Dog 2 to 4, the power hour with Mad Dog and the Humper 4 to 5.

[00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:17.180]
The Humper by himself.

[00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:19.820]
At least I was in up for 2 or 3, 5 to 6.

[00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:20.800]
That was funny.

[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:25.720]
Dolphins all access 6 to 7 because we have to kiss their ass because we got the dolphin games which is killing us.

[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.140]
Hurricane Hotline at the Rascale at 7 to 9.

[00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:31.300]
Well, we got some purring and then Dolphins all access again 9 to 10.

[00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:32.240]
Wow.

[00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:35.480]
Followed by Game Night with 8K, 10 PM to 1 AM.

[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:37.320]
No Marling game tonight which is a real blessing.

[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:38.480]
They've only lost what?

[00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:40.060]
21 out of their last something?

[00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:41.140]
Yeah, about that.

[00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:42.520]
And they're 20 games under 500.

[00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:45.740]
And buried deep in last place in their division now.

[00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:49.820]
Even the Unctions Washington Nance who just kicked their ass again yesterday.

[00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:51.740]
Our three games ahead of them.

[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.280]
The last place, 20 game under 500.

[00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:59.380]
And Boy, what a cool for Joel Feinberg across this week to get the Marlins and the Panthers.

[00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:02.280]
You get a lot of baby.

[00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:03.760]
Alright.

[00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:08.560]
The field Rogers on Sportshold Radio WQAL.

[00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:16.840]
The ground Jesus.

[00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:24.920]
Michael Vick found Jesus.

[00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:32.160]
They might get kicked off the squad so we found God.

[00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:34.640]
Alright.

[00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:39.960]
Michael Vick found Jesus.

[00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:47.220]
He likes to wear the USK9s now every time.

[00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:58.240]
If you're well known and you want to a tone call a preacher on the telephone.

[00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:02.700]
Say you love Jaycee when you went to your plea.

[00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:11.060]
Alright.

[00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:12.700]
10, 18, at 5, 60, everybody.

[00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:14.020]
Q. I'm happy Thursday to you.

[00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:14.960]
I'll say stay September.

[00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:17.460]
And the phone is his dead as a doer now.

[00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:18.480]
How were your calls yesterday?

[00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:19.580]
But today were some moccons.

[00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:20.960]
Oh yeah, they were smoking something.

[00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:21.800]
But they weren't calling.

[00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:23.080]
They weren't calling?

[00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:24.380]
You mean like this?

[00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:24.740]
No, whatever.

[00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:26.460]
There's not a call on that board man.

[00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:28.760]
And another we got the new morning show with all the spots on it.

[00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:31.700]
Joe Rosen, Kevin Costner, whatever his name is.

[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:32.780]
What was his name again?

[00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:33.800]
Jason Jackson.

[00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:34.540]
Jason Jackson.

[00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:36.720]
Why do I have a tough time thinking about his name?

[00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:37.300]
I don't get it.

[00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:38.340]
Too many J.A.s.

[00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:40.800]
It was a rape parion to show too that would put it over the top.

[00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:42.340]
And Ray could do some live spots.

[00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:43.120]
Why not?

[00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:44.540]
5, 6, 7.

[00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:45.500]
In fact, I'll tell you what.

[00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:47.400]
Call in and we'll let you do your own live spot.

[00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:50.660]
Today is Thursday so we got the two for one deal again at noon today.

[00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:52.680]
River House in Fort Lauderdale is on today.

[00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:54.960]
And he's our $50 certificate.

[00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:55.860]
It's going for $25.

[00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:56.780]
Am I right about that?

[00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:57.960]
We got $100 of my believe?

[00:13:58.200 --> 00:13:58.440]
Yes.

[00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:00.940]
That's what the month mice do set.

[00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:01.400]
You fair.

[00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:02.440]
When she came in this morning?

[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:03.860]
WDQ-I-M, hello.

[00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:06.280]
Hey Neil, that morgue is commercial.

[00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:08.140]
That guy said he has word like a thought he said?

[00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:08.920]
No.

[00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:11.400]
Oh, I take a look at it again.

[00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:12.380]
I think you might hear it.

[00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:13.000]
And you take it?

[00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:13.260]
Marshall?

[00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:15.320]
Yeah, the other morgue is commercial.

[00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:16.060]
The guy said it.

[00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:17.300]
No, the guy did not say it.

[00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:18.980]
Listen, don't be knocking our spots okay.

[00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:20.180]
Although that would be a lot of material.

[00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:26.360]
$5.670560, pawn 560 on a Verizon singular wireless line.

[00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:27.340]
Just say something.

[00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:28.020]
That's all we ask.

[00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:29.340]
We don't want you to say something intelligent.

[00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:30.380]
Something important.

[00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:31.140]
Something meaningful.

[00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:31.880]
Something significant.

[00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:32.780]
Something worthwhile.

[00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:33.780]
Something useful.

[00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:36.080]
Something, you know, just anything.

[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:37.300]
I mean, they still can't do it.

[00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:40.940]
Is there anybody who lets the question?

[00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:41.360]
Look at that.

[00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:42.600]
This is very depressing to me.

[00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:44.060]
This is even worse than Tuesday.

[00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:48.240]
And I'm supposed to come and do this five days a week starting on Monday.

[00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:48.740]
I don't know.

[00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:49.780]
I have to really analyze this.

[00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:53.120]
Although everybody I talk to, which you know, is a whole lot of people,

[00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:54.460]
but they said Tuesday show was fine.

[00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:55.180]
I thought it was great.

[00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:56.220]
Yeah.

[00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:58.840]
And why are you screening the calls again, you idiot?

[00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:00.500]
Well, I wasn't sure if you wanted me to screen it or not.

[00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:00.780]
No!

[00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:02.680]
No, no.

[00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:03.900]
It doesn't work.

[00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:04.580]
Don't you understand?

[00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:05.260]
It's really hard.

[00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:05.860]
It doesn't work.

[00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:07.400]
I've been doing it this way for a hundred years.

[00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:09.940]
Don't pay any attention to Fat ass, jolly joe Bell.

[00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:10.320]
Okay.

[00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:12.860]
He doesn't know talk radio from that fat ass, okay?

[00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:14.500]
Do not be doing that.

[00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:15.260]
Sounds good to me.

[00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:16.820]
QA-M, hello.

[00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:18.000]
Hi, Neil.

[00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:18.880]
I like it.

[00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:19.880]
WDQ-A-M, hello.

[00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:20.980]
Hey, Neil.

[00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:21.840]
Yes, sir.

[00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:22.620]
How are you today?

[00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:24.640]
Tech of a job is screening, too, by the way.

[00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:26.100]
There are Chrissy puts Reverend Jones on.

[00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:26.380]
Yes.

[00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:27.920]
He's a terrible screener.

[00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:29.240]
He's the worst.

[00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:29.320]

[00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:31.500]
Yeah, maybe that should have been on the poll yesterday.

[00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:33.180]
We'd had some votes, terrible screener.

[00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:35.100]
Well, you put me in any back.

[00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:35.920]
Yeah, what did I break?

[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:36.420]
Yeah, okay.

[00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:36.860]
No thanks.

[00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:37.880]
QA-M, hello.

[00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:41.060]
I haven't talked to myself for two minutes and no one's been answering.

[00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:42.140]
I guess he ain't screaming.

[00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:43.800]
No, he's not screaming.

[00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:45.120]
He's Neil, how you doing?

[00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:46.160]
Why are you talking to yourself?

[00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:47.540]
Well, this place will make you do it.

[00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:49.360]
Yeah, you know what I would do in a month.

[00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:50.740]
I would do that for years, so.

[00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:51.980]
No, I'm not a lot of him.

[00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:54.540]
Is there any live spot you'd like to do on a show?

[00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:56.520]
Yeah, you know what I like to do?

[00:15:57.100 --> 00:16:00.100]
What I want to do is I want to run Fred Thompson's campaign.

[00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:03.640]
Basically take snippets from law and order and hunt for red October.

[00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:04.220]
Yeah.

[00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:04.960]
Twice them together.

[00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:06.440]
I think we can get this guy in.

[00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:07.880]
What a candidate he is, man.

[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:08.800]
What a jackass.

[00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:09.880]
What a big bull heart.

[00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:10.580]
I think I can get a big dicey up there.

[00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:12.840]
If you look up the term blow hard in addiction,

[00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:14.240]
or you'll find his picture next to it.

[00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:15.620]
All right.

[00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:16.140]
I love you, Neil.

[00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:16.900]
See ya.

[00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:20.700]
Remember all that anti-bubble business in the anti-generino business

[00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:22.440]
and just blowing a lot of smoke in the Senate?

[00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:23.640]
Bubble, bubble, bubble, always.

[00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:24.920]
Here with a big stupid mouth.

[00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:26.200]
That's Fred Thompson.

[00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:28.080]
But he's been on television, like George says,

[00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:29.700]
when somebody's been on television or in the movies,

[00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:31.360]
there were big superstars right away.

[00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:31.740]
That's it.

[00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:33.060]
So let's make him the president.

[00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:34.180]
Right.

[00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:35.420]
Makes a lot of sense to me.

[00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:37.200]
WDQ-AM, our favorite line.

[00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:37.480]
Hello.

[00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:40.500]
Yeah, we got a round of 20, too.

[00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:43.580]
WDQ-AM, hello.

[00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:44.260]
Hello.

[00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:46.040]
Yeah, I'm going to go dance on his grave.

[00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:46.620]
Yes, sir.

[00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:50.220]
Yeah, I just received a call and you're using my voice or something.

[00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:51.840]
WDQ-AM, yeah.

[00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:53.240]
Everybody's using your voice.

[00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:54.140]
It sure seems like it.

[00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:55.100]
Q-A-M, hello.

[00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:56.300]
Neil, I need to help.

[00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:57.720]
Yes, sounds like it.

[00:16:57.980 --> 00:16:58.900]
I got a, yeah.

[00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:03.740]
I was in a heated conversation with some of my right-wing

[00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:05.880]
conservative friends the other day.

[00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:07.720]
And I was mentioning all the scandals.

[00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:09.280]
It all riddled this administration.

[00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:12.760]
And one specifically was the Valerie Plain,

[00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:16.020]
the Joe Wilson, the Owing Valerie Plain.

[00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:20.640]
And my buddy said to me, well Todd, Valerie,

[00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:22.300]
she was never cold-rooted.

[00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:24.240]
She was never undercover for say-

[00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:25.180]
Your friend is an idiot.

[00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:26.140]
Your friend is a moron.

[00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:27.020]
Tell him to read something.

[00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:29.180]
In fact, go on an interview and read something to him, okay?

[00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:32.200]
Well, why are people this stupid?

[00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:34.120]
Is it possible we're going to have an election next year?

[00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:35.280]
Well, why have an election?

[00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:36.580]
Why even bother?

[00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:37.420]
Why waste the time?

[00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:39.620]
Although Oprah's coming out from Barack Obama,

[00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:43.340]
you know, as much as I like him a lot,

[00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:45.700]
and I support him, and we'll vote for him 20 or 30 times,

[00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:47.680]
the fact that Amanda remains that, you know,

[00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:51.100]
if we're going to depend on Oprah to get the women's vote,

[00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:52.580]
well, yeah, we'll take whatever we can get.

[00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:53.240]
That's right.

[00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:55.580]
642 votes.

[00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:56.980]
I bet we're going to do 1,000 today, Chris,

[00:17:57.140 --> 00:18:00.240]
and then you'll fear us after you guys did 348 yesterday.

[00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:02.080]
And by the way, Chris, you're a terrible screener.

[00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:02.540]
Okay.

[00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:03.860]
That's what somebody says.

[00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:05.800]
So that's another reason for you not to screen the calls.

[00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:07.140]
But you don't want to do it anyway, right?

[00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:08.080]
Exactly.

[00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:10.160]
You'd rather croak than have to do that.

[00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:10.600]
Correct.

[00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:11.840]
And I don't blame you.

[00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:13.020]
W-D-Q-A-M, hello.

[00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:13.820]
No.

[00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:14.720]
Yes, sir.

[00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:17.740]
What still in Paul's material would the gift the gift give?

[00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:18.920]
Yeah.

[00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:20.640]
Very, very dear to dear to dear to dear to you.

[00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:21.100]
Very funny.

[00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:22.300]
W-D-Q-A-M, hello.

[00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:25.600]
That's a very angry game state, our lumber.

[00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:26.580]
Very, very dear to you, dude.

[00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:30.020]
Not bad.

[00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:32.700]
Let's record that and get it on the morning show for tomorrow.

[00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:36.720]
I mean, seriously, you know what I'd like to do?

[00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:37.860]
I wish, I don't know.

[00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:39.140]
Can you go in and see the log?

[00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:40.740]
Can you sneak in there and take a look at the log?

[00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:41.240]
Yeah, of course.

[00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:42.340]
To the morning show.

[00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:42.840]
Yeah.

[00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:44.500]
And count up for me.

[00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:47.720]
How many spots they ran between 7 and 10 this morning?

[00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:48.040]
Okay.

[00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:49.100]
I'm not talking about live spots.

[00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:50.600]
Just total number of minutes.

[00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:51.360]
Yeah, no problem.

[00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:53.520]
W-D-Q-A-M, hello.

[00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:54.980]
Any other morning?

[00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:55.800]
Yes, sir.

[00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:56.380]
When is the end?

[00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:57.440]
When is the end, sir.

[00:18:57.700 --> 00:18:58.320]
Hey, I have a question.

[00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:02.300]
This morning show, like, Kenyann Bolshaw, I agree with you 100%.

[00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:03.360]
That was a disaster.

[00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:09.220]
The worst piece of garbage ever to make final tubes on a transmitter glow.

[00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:09.720]

[00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:10.340]
Rhymes were glow.

[00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:11.240]
I agree.

[00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:16.520]
But do you blame someone on the PD or on the Kenyann Bol?

[00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:18.340]
I mean, are their hands kind of tied?

[00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:19.140]
All of these things.

[00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:19.800]
All of these things.

[00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:19.880]
All of these things.

[00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:19.880]

[00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:19.900]
All of these things.

[00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:19.940]
All of these things.

[00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:20.140]
All of these things.

[00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:20.180]
All of these things.

[00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:20.320]
Really?

[00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:22.420]
Because this is the Joe Rochel.

[00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:26.300]
I mean, I love Joe, but they're blitchering with the all these live spots and commercials.

[00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:31.680]
We're gonna have all the coaches on every day too is that gonna be a regular every day thing?

[00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:33.100]
I'm gonna open house and

[00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:39.180]
He didn't have to know wait a minute true was on your horse now. Yes, it was on true was on your

[00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:41.860]
No

[00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:47.320]
Oh my god, I'm gonna kill ourselves. There's been nice knowing you

Stop doing this stop butchering up the morning shows, okay? Just like with Stern air every morning show they've had on it

[00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:39.680]
Put you up sure they did the worst team then they put Stern on here

[00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:44.060]
And they were dumping every time anything he did they were dumping it and playing classical music in the background

[00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:51.920]
They turned the Howard Stern show into a piece of Swiss cheese on the stand still had big numbers and we had huge numbers in that book remember that

Huge humongous gigantic and then it's oh we can't have this on the earth

The daddy keeps action show all right in the seven o'clock hour there was eight live spots

[00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:59.520]
16 recorded spots and a partridge in peer tree. That's 24 minutes correct

[00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:06.360]
Well now some of them were 30 seconds, but then oh rarely is a last by the way a minute right so you got you know

[00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:10.660]
As they're producer was saying exactly I didn't I didn't ask you to go through a whole

[00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:15.920]
Analyzation like here's some kind of a programming expert. I just for the number. I'm a face at a clock hour is seven lives

[00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:21.120]
17 recorded spots. Yeah, and seven lives 17 recorded in the nine o'clock hour

[00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:24.860]
See I asked you for the number of minutes not for the number of you know, all right

[00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:27.680]
Well, they number each each break is log at five to five

[00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:31.240]
Producer fat sack. What was he saying? He was bitching and learning about it to yeah

[00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:32.460]
You know there's no

[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.460]
Extend it that we have Joe Rose back here because he's like a real broadcast during a good guy

[00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:41.760]
But why is he shouting all the time even on that last spot we played he was shouting screaming

[00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:47.480]
And at the end of the show this morning he was screaming and shouting do you notice that yes?

[00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:51.200]
Maybe that all that time over there with Joel is turned the Joey was screamer

[00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:53.480]
I don't know what that's all about screaming and shouting it

[00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:59.360]
Maybe it's just me and my old my daughtering old age now okay, maybe I'm just a can't handle the shock of all the screaming

[00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:02.500]
That's going to hit too loud you're too old. That's it

[00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:06.520]

[00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:46.100]
That's so unfortunate. I had a journalism degree back in the 80s and that ain't worth toilet paper anymore

[00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:50.820]
No one would hire me, you know for the yeah, well based on your personality. I can understand why

[00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:56.880]
650 and votes on the pool and speaking of the website I just forgot my point

[00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:02.100]
I had something very extraordinarily important to pass along just it just passed right on by that's old age agency

[00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:04.840]
Just wait till it comes back to you. No, it will come back

[00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:11.060]
They're probably like a 201 and then I'll interrupt the mad dog show and say oh guess what the world's coming to an end and somebody will say

[00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:15.960]
Well, what does it have to do with sports? We're gonna cancel the games. We're not gonna cancel the games. Are we Neil?

[00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:18.060]
That guy would call back again. Give me that song a dance about mailing it in 666 all right 666 baby

Pretty weak WQ. I am all on

[00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:22.540]
Yeah, listen, I was in a supermarket bathroom and

[00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:29.720]
And this gentleman next to me was kept jingling his keys and got a lot of water on my back. Oh, that's a sheer sign. Yeah

[00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:35.220]
Is that a good sign? Yeah, that's a bad sign. Muzz a good sign if you're you know horny. I guess

[00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:41.620]
Maybe with Sandy Claus. Maybe it was giving you a little jingle 5 6 7 0 5 60 and

[00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:46.580]
Pound 5 asked me if he was Jolly. Okay. Maybe it was fat ass Jolly joe you never know

[00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:49.220]
And

[00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:52.980]
And pound 5 60 and the Verizon singular wireless line keep pumping those numbers baby get used to it

[00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:57.880]
You're going to be doing it for a year and a three or four months whatever it is nice that that paycheck showed up early yesterday

[00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:00.720]
Can you believe that on the fifth? I believe it must have been a mistake

[00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:05.400]
Maybe they're going to ask for it back had to be a mistake remember the one time to give me I mean once in a while

[00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:07.620]
They do something really stupid and good, you know

[00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:09.580]
I mean stupid and bad is like when it shows up late

[00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:12.240]
one time they try to pay me twice

[00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:17.820]
Remember that it's a long time ago. Yeah four years ago and they've already sent a check to the house

[00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:21.600]
And then I come in to work the next morning and there's another paycheck the same amount and

[00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:24.260]
Of course, you know if I would have been stupid

[00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:28.180]
I would have just taken the check and cashed that one too and people say no that wouldn't have been stupid

[00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:30.440]
They would have been smart. You're like when they when they caught it

[00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:34.840]
I mean like I'm like I'm gonna like lie about not getting the paycheck that would have been really good

[00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:41.000]
I would have wound up getting written up for that and you know nothing worse than getting written up by the beastly

[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:45.540]
I have these folders you know everybody's got a file and when they write you up all boy

[00:28:45.540 --> 00:28:48.020]
Then they take away your tea room privileges

[00:28:48.820 --> 00:28:50.260]
W.A.N. Hello

[00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:52.600]
Yeah, I want to speak to Neil speaking

[00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:55.080]
Yeah, this isn't Neil

[00:28:55.660 --> 00:29:00.080]
Let me say it again. So hang up. Okay. Yeah, if you don't think it's Neil or talk to somebody else

[00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:01.780]
What can I do for you sir?

[00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:02.800]
I

[00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:10.760]
Think about this week's games are lose every game they play from now until the year 25

[00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:18.080]
That's what I think about the canes. I think they suck and I think you suck, okay, and I didn't think you'd get any good call today

[00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:23.980]
You're gonna give a lot of great calls, okay? You know something I was thinking about this yesterday for about 10 seconds

[00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:28.520]
Because all I care about is getting paid at this point by these great-rovers by these lunatics

[00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:32.220]
When you tell me that Drew Rosencrantz Dean Schwartz of a bird was on again this morning

[00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:35.280]
I want to get down on my hands and he's in puke my guts out

[00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:38.040]
I want to vomit meals that I ate 50 years ago, okay?

[00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:40.680]
So what happens if I tell you he also read a life spot oh

[00:29:41.540 --> 00:29:47.560]
No, are you just making that up or why I swear he read a life spot would it was a little Rosencrantz read a live spot on a Joe

[00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:49.800]
Roe show this is an infomnia

[00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:54.400]
This is on it. Let me say it again unacceptable is what it is

[00:29:55.800 --> 00:30:01.860]
You know, or other than in what is it like Carson City? Where's it in the vaguen Nevada that it's a prostitution is legal

[00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:07.360]
Carson County, yeah, they're about right somewhere where it's legal not in Vegas per se

[00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:13.680]
But like just outside of Vegas the prostitution is legal this is the biggest warehouse on the face of the earth is this radio station

[00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:20.080]
I've never seen for if you got a buck will will say a bunch of crap. Oh, we're gonna give you a 400 mentions remember that

[00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:25.080]
We're gonna give you 400 mentions and then they would put a poor Miguel who got stabbed in a back in can

[00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:31.340]
Who ought to be crossed the street by the way poor Miguel would have to write these the liners that I'm supposed to read and I refuse to read him

[00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:35.720]
Remember those days sure because they kept promising. Oh, well, we'll give you like 7,000 mentions

[00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:39.680]
You know if you just give us some money just give us a bag of money. It will give you a lot of mentions on here

[00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:45.680]
And then of course the people that do really actually buy spots and spend a lot of money. We can't be bothered servicing them

[00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:47.580]
Cuz they oh copy eight us

[00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:52.480]
You know like Gary Sarner copy eight us and Hank Guerrero is he still there by the way?

[00:30:54.220 --> 00:30:58.680]
Hank Guerrero is still there. Sure. Oh my god one Hank is enough for us

[00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:00.400]
One of them's got to go

[00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:24.880]
Well, Rosenhouse my ass

[00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:27.420]
Okay, now before I play the bit here, let me just ask you a question

[00:31:27.420 --> 00:31:31.160]
You just played the rejoin with a guy that we're not supposed to be a plane his voice

[00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:32.720]
Oh

[00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:37.060]
Not well, it's yeah, it's in the rejoin bin and so you know that was their fault

[00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:43.320]
It's in the rejoin bin and who put it there couldn't be clearance could it good morning americans. It's Paul Harvey

[00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:45.480]
standby for news

[00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:48.640]
John walks into a bar and says

[00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:51.520]
Hello bartender give me two shots

[00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:55.760]
Pete the bartender says you want them both now or one at a time

[00:31:56.320 --> 00:32:01.900]
Jason replies, oh, I want them both now ones for me and ones for this little guy here

[00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:08.020]
And he pulls a tiny three inch man out of his pocket Pete the bartender says he can drink

[00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:15.940]
Certainly he can drink says Jason. So Pete forced the shots and sure enough the little guy drinks it all of that's

[00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:16.920]
amazing

[00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:20.680]
Says Pete the bartender what else can he do can he walk

[00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:25.340]
Jason clicks a quarter down to the end of the bar and says hey, Jake go get that

[00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:31.800]
Sure enough the little man runs down to the end of the bar and picks up the quarter and runs back down and gives it

[00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:32.360]
to Jason

[00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:37.600]
Pete the bartender is in total shock and again repeats that's amazing

[00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:40.420]
What else can he do does he talk

[00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:43.360]
Jason says you're he talks

[00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:50.400]

685 votes on the poll we don't care about you and your stupid ass stock market okay your schlock market

[00:33:17.940 --> 00:33:24.160]
Once before the Iraq invasion president was apparently ignored a 2002 Oval Office briefing in which CIA director George tenant

[00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:28.500]
Provided the president with intelligence that Sada was saying did not possess weapons of mass

[00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:32.500]
Destruction according to former Clinton advisor and salon commissity Blumenthal

[00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:38.460]
Reporting in salon Blumenthal writes that according to his sources two former CIA officers

[00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:43.780]
Bush dismissed as worthless this information from the Iraqi foreign minister a member of sedoms inner circle

[00:33:43.780 --> 00:33:46.900]
Although it turned out to be accurate in every detail. Ten it never brought it up again

[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:52.660]
Blumenthal also adds that the intelligence from that day was left out of the national intelligence estimate about

[00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:59.560]
2002 which definitely stated that he had WMV the president had no interest in the intelligence of CIA officer

[00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:03.920]
Disclosed Bush didn't give an F about the intelligence. He had his mind made up. I didn't like that

[00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:10.360]
That's the headline here salon former CIA officers report Bush didn't give a F about intelligence. How do you like that?

[00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:11.560]
Effing idiot

[00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:13.680]
F and Zimbabwe's junior

[00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:21.700]
But nobody cares about that anymore because Fred Thompson's running for president. He's on television. Isn't that important stuff? Sure. What are

[00:34:23.860 --> 00:34:28.100]
68 and a pull we're going to do a thousand votes today. That's really going to be great and then of course lung head there

[00:34:29.220 --> 00:34:32.600]
He's going to say do you I don't know what happened yesterday that pull about me and my nickname?

[00:34:33.260 --> 00:34:35.060]
Hey, I had no problem like it and votes on that thing

[00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:39.220]
I do I have a big problem with it. Why I apologize

[00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:43.340]
We got those certificates in just over an hour now. Well hour and 12 minutes for the river house coming up

[00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:46.500]
We got a hundred of them 50 dollar certificates for 25 bucks

[00:34:47.700 --> 00:34:49.540]
And it's going to be a little bit slower doing it

[00:34:49.540 --> 00:34:53.520]
You want to know why because when you go to qm.com now in order to get to the regular page

[00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:58.700]
You have to click pass the words as Joe Rosen the keep Jackson in the mornings now whatever it says there

[00:34:58.700 --> 00:35:00.940]
And then you have to go through like a second step

[00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:02.660]
Like a two-step program

[00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:05.160]
WQ way and hello

[00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:07.180]
Neil yes, sir

[00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:10.160]
The other day I was listening to your program and uh

[00:35:10.740 --> 00:35:17.080]
Rick Charles on yeah, and they you're talking about real radio. I think it was a website. There's all the old

[00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:22.320]
DJs and I logged onto that thing and that's really cool

[00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:23.120]
Listen to that

[00:35:23.580 --> 00:35:28.440]
So the guys were something else was cows back in the 50s and 60. Yeah

[00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:34.360]
I'm the one got some closer your age of 61 and uh really enjoyed listening to the

[00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:35.700]
brought back memories

[00:35:36.260 --> 00:35:41.060]
Well, I've run yeah brings back memories to me when I used to really be in radio. Okay. Have a great day, sir

[00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:47.000]
56705 60 when there were personalities when there were people at something to say when there were people who were entertained

[00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:51.800]
People who were like interesting and could actually do a show and like but it beep but it would but but not anymore

[00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:58.600]
Now in fact, I'm beginning to fear my worst fears are now being uh, you know confirmed today

[00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:02.540]
With these reports on the news and not just about the spots

[00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:09.620]
But about the Drew Rosenstein thing about the fact that they're gonna put the same infectious garbage in the morning show

[00:36:09.620 --> 00:36:13.060]
No matter who the hosts are now. Why did you think that anything would be different?

[00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:18.380]
I was hoping I was praying that Joe Rose would have enough for Hutzpah enough balls to say to them

[00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:20.280]
Hey, if you think you're gonna butcher the show up again

[00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:24.840]
But he was so desperate to get away from Joel finds the raw rugburg whatever his name is across the street

[00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:29.420]
That he came back to us again because he's a masochist. Maybe that's why he's screaming so loud

[00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:32.580]
That's a good point. The pain is so bad. He can't endure it

[00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:37.120]
What is it? I said, that's a good point. I hadn't thought of that. It's an excellent point

[00:36:37.900 --> 00:36:39.080]
W.D. Q.A.M. Hello

[00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:42.740]

So now that we're doing the screenless again, let me just say this to you. Okay, anybody who causes is

We'll make an exception for you momentarily. Yes, sir. Okay. I was just gonna say don't count friend tops and out

[00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:09.940]

And don't forget about George Murphy and Ronald Reagan. Don't forget about all of it and Arnold

Don't forget about Arnold, okay? There is nobody too stupid for the American people to like sells short, okay?

[00:37:25.540 --> 00:37:28.360]
The dumber the better. That's what they like. Dumb be us

[00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:31.520]
Where is it? Dumbos be us

[00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:37.760]
Well, look at that after its decade log run Matt Rugges indicated radio talk show is about to end

[00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:39.620]
It's about to end you fairy

[00:37:39.620 --> 00:37:43.440]
According to industry trade report and regional media blogger based in Ohio

[00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:45.660]
These sources have September 30

[00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:50.300]
Is the final program date for misfudge that self-aiding fag

[00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:56.960]
Created at the peak of Dredges Monaco, Lewinsky fuel fame the show was confined to Sunday evenings apparently at his insistence

[00:37:57.640 --> 00:38:02.020]
At the time the internet star said even offered a weekday show but chose the weekend slot instead

[00:38:02.020 --> 00:38:03.980]
I wonder which slot he likes best now

[00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:12.880]
That proved a smart strategy on Sunday many of the nation's biggest talks stations picked up the show were it remained under the radar for a number of years with little competition

[00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:18.080]
By contrast the weekday our waves have long been crowded with far more syndicated shows than the market can absorb

[00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:23.800]
And another benefit was the fact that Dredge was able to use his site to promote the show which proved especially effective

[00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:27.220]
Pettling his right wing paranoid self-aiding crap

[00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:32.480]
What's causing Matt's radio accident uncertain? It says here. This is from what what is this from

[00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:35.900]
A site called radio equalizer. I have no idea what it is

[00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:36.940]
um

[00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:38.880]
Anyway, it says um

[00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:45.280]
Rumors are that the drug report kingpin spends a lot of time traveling these days often leaving site updates to others

[00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:48.200]
And so far at least judges made no public comment on these reports

[00:38:48.860 --> 00:38:51.920]
Since an eddy based host Bill Cunningham has said it be taken over the program

[00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:57.380]
But it's hard to say what their most premier radio affiliates will carry the new show or if this slot will be observed by additional weekend

[00:38:57.380 --> 00:39:00.060]
Reruns and infomercials and then here's an update at the bottom

[00:39:00.060 --> 00:39:05.180]
It says the mainstream media not picks up the story since an eddy inquire reports of Cunningham is indeed being given the show

[00:39:05.180 --> 00:39:08.480]
According to the paper he'll be less political on air than drudge

[00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:09.640]
Which frankly sounds

[00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:12.920]
Asanaan as we headed to one of the most exciting western cycles in decades

[00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:17.720]
It says and addition the article only seems to guide the mystery of why exactly Matt is leaving the show

[00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:22.940]
So far not a word about the situation at his at her own site the fudge report

[00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:27.080]
Aren't you said by that news? I'm weeping can you hear it?

[00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:30.580]
He won't be on every Sunday to keep mentioning me at least 20 30 times on the show either

[00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:36.040]

No misfoges leaving the airways all well the paranoid right wingers do now on Sunday night

[00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:15.680]

In 1982 the newspaper reported Craig had sex with a man in a bathroom at Union station in DC

[00:44:05.020 --> 00:44:07.620]
But now I know your day so it's all good girl friends

[00:44:08.300 --> 00:44:11.680]
It's 1102 at 560. No, who Larry Craig reminds me of Ray Perry

[00:44:12.820 --> 00:44:15.920]
How's that after it died? I don't know. He just reminds me of oh

[00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:20.460]
I'm gonna say what are you trying to say? I'm like a pumpkin. That's what I'm trying to say

[00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:30.620]
718 votes on our award winning pool and sport in Hollywood whose the mood is lethargic on my space when somebody says they're mood is lethargic

[00:44:30.620 --> 00:44:31.900]
What does that tell you?

[00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:35.320]
Uh, that they're an average typical self-loatheian at least. Uh, where I would expect hostile

[00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:39.300]
I guess he finally responded and I told you he was chewing me out because I said the one day last week

[00:44:39.300 --> 00:44:41.480]
I won 800 bucks of woodmine and ran out. Mm-hmm

[00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:45.620]
He says I thought when you said you ran out that you won 800 and then gave it back no, but he thought I meant I ran out of all

[00:44:45.620 --> 00:44:47.800]
Oh, he misunderstood you

[00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:50.360]
Oh

[00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:56.060]
And then he tells me he liked online gaming who'd play 50 bucks for hours and per chance

[00:44:56.060 --> 00:45:01.240]
I think really quickly and have some sort of magic on this so I could use that to play more he says

[00:45:02.660 --> 00:45:06.060]
Wow, get yourself a life sweetheart looks to me like you're really desperate

[00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:08.700]
5 6 7 0 5 60

[00:45:10.060 --> 00:45:14.280]
pound 5 60 on a Verizon singular wireless line. So anyway, I'm thinking that

[00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:18.360]
Last I started this about a half hour ago and then you interrupted sorry

[00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:22.680]
I was thinking last night that what we could rename the show is Neil talks to morons for four hours

[00:45:23.500 --> 00:45:27.760]
Which wouldn't be anything. Yeah, we don't have to rename this. That's all. I think they know that right

[00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:32.240]
Many times over the years people have asked what I do for living and I'll say oh I do a talk show and they'll say well

[00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:35.220]
What kind of a show isn't I say I talk to a whole is it for four hours every day?

[00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:38.200]
I give you a lot of money to talk to morons for four hours every day

[00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:40.820]
WQ a.m. Hello

[00:45:41.380 --> 00:45:43.540]
Neil you have to pay back. Yeah

[00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:45.300]
WQ a.m. Hello

[00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:53.540]
Hello, yes sir. Oh, yes. I wanted to see if Neil had heard about Michael Vicks dogs

[00:45:53.540 --> 00:45:57.280]
exchanging gate dog sex for victories. If you knew anything about that

[00:45:58.120 --> 00:46:02.280]
WQ a.m. Hello

[00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:03.920]
Q a.m. Hello

[00:46:04.780 --> 00:46:08.900]
Q a.m. Neil

[00:46:09.460 --> 00:46:09.720]
Yes

[00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:20.460]
Jim DeFese is gone. He's gone. Maybe he blew up. Maybe he exploded. I think

[00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:24.900]
Yeah, I just saw it. He's not even on their website anymore

[00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:26.440]
Who's they?

[00:46:27.980 --> 00:46:30.420]
What state what station was he on?

[00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:33.440]
He was on 940 wins. Yeah

[00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:38.200]
6 to 9 and he is gone. He's gone. I'll be damned

[00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:41.120]
I'm gone. See you

[00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:41.820]
You're gone

[00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:47.200]
Jim DeFese is gone. I wonder if he sounds so depressed. Jesus Christ almighty man

[00:46:47.900 --> 00:46:50.320]
You know what's like I remember I talked about when I was a kid

[00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:53.700]
He used to flip the baseball cards with my friends and even you did that even though you hated baseball

[00:46:53.700 --> 00:46:56.740]
We would ask him that flip that that's what's going on

[00:46:56.740 --> 00:47:00.000]
I was like you know like you're a deck of cards and we're like foot them one over here

[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:02.580]
And this one's going over there and this one's going across the street

[00:47:02.580 --> 00:47:07.680]
I wouldn't be surprised if some of our people between the and waxy and us bump into each other across the street

[00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:11.800]
On the way you know what I'm saying. I sure hope they don't bump into the hump

[00:47:13.060 --> 00:47:15.400]
Talk about getting real-rooted that was funny

[00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:21.200]
5 6 7 0 5 60 see back in the day when I used to do this the phones would be smoking when you're doing screenless

[00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:26.840]
There's no excuse under the sun for having to pump the numbers when you're doing screenless unless of course you have nobody listening right

[00:47:28.260 --> 00:47:33.040]
And pound 5 60 and they've arrived in singular wireless line especially with all the crap that's going on these days

[00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:36.840]
I can't think of too much except for Larry Craig doing that toe tap and routine in the T-room

[00:47:37.300 --> 00:47:41.900]
And Fred Thompson's going to run for president which everybody already knew and he goes on that right wing

[00:47:41.900 --> 00:47:45.460]
Foney Jay Leno showed a one-ounce it remember Jay Leno introducing Arnold

[00:47:45.460 --> 00:47:52.740]
Sure, oh brother. He embraces every right wing a piece of turd that comes down the pike Jay Leno. There's a talent not

[00:47:53.900 --> 00:47:55.580]
Wtq. I am hello

[00:47:56.220 --> 00:48:00.580]
You know, I'll tell you one thing if he had like a normal chin. He wouldn't make 50 cent

[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:03.020]
Wtq. I am hello

[00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:11.020]
I have six 1960s Arab stuck up your ass. We know it WQ a and hello. Hey, Neil. Yeah

[00:48:11.660 --> 00:48:19.480]
Neil I'm so glad that Jim DeFeed is gone. He was very boring. Yeah, very very boring. Thank God

[00:48:22.660 --> 00:48:26.960]
Okay, let's take a survey on that is anybody happy that Jim DeFeed is gone from the radio

[00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:30.300]
I thought he was like a big mover and shaker. He's moving it and shaking it

[00:48:32.120 --> 00:48:38.620]
725 and at pool baby we're gonna have way over 800 by noon which means a thousand is given. Oh there's Fred Thompson on Jay Leno

[00:48:38.620 --> 00:48:44.120]
Fred Thompson is banking on the idea that it's better to be late than to be one of the other better to be laid

[00:48:44.120 --> 00:48:47.420]
They're not to be laid. That's what Fred Thompson is saying and who the hell would want to be laid by him

[00:48:47.420 --> 00:48:52.840]
He's just a grotesque and he always seems angry for Thompson, you know, he always got that like that look

[00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:58.020]
I had not noticed no. Oh, well, I'll notice next time. I've got that angry look on his push like

[00:48:58.720 --> 00:48:59.800]
Kind of like Dr. Phil

[00:49:01.080 --> 00:49:05.440]
Who was on biography last night and boy I turned that off really fast very very fast Dr. Phil

[00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:11.500]
And I didn't realize that he represented Oprah in a case. Remember when the meat people in Texas suit her ass because she said

[00:49:11.500 --> 00:49:15.240]
Uh, the mad cow that stopped me cold from ever touching another burger

[00:49:15.240 --> 00:49:19.660]
Well, she must be eating a lot of other crap to make up for it. I'll say that remember that lawsuit

[00:49:19.660 --> 00:49:22.400]
Uh-huh, and he was the lawyer and he won a rass off lawsuit

[00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:26.900]
That's why she hoard for him on her show and he won't have been his own show not because he knows anything

[00:49:27.500 --> 00:49:29.460]
Or because anybody likes him which they don't

[00:49:30.420 --> 00:49:31.360]
Wtq. I am hello

[00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:33.300]
Q. I. M. Hello

[00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:35.360]
He go and he can

[00:49:35.940 --> 00:49:36.920]
Wtq. I am hello

[00:49:36.920 --> 00:49:41.960]
Yeah, Fred Thompson's angry look. That's that's his look. That's the I'm the serious politician

[00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:47.060]
Not an actor look. I don't know what Reagan did when he got into slimed into office

[00:49:47.060 --> 00:49:50.280]
But let me tell you something that morning. You know, if angry all the time or angry

[00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:52.500]
He just looks like he had too much shoe polish in his head

[00:49:52.500 --> 00:49:55.460]
Before he got elected you know, he was all angry and stuff

[00:49:55.460 --> 00:49:57.600]
You know naturally with that mess with their rencontre

[00:49:57.600 --> 00:50:02.520]
When that came on then he got a smile and it's when he got a whole time was he a when he fracked yeah now left last stuff

[00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:06.700]
Anyway, that morning show you guys got we traded one mess for no, I mean, Joe's a great guy and stuff

[00:50:06.700 --> 00:50:12.640]
But Christ all these just too many spots man. I can't I can't sit through it all so what good is a morning show

[00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:14.500]
Of nobody's listening because they're switching off the spot

[00:50:14.500 --> 00:50:19.020]
You know something you could you could fart into a windstorm and have a better chance of somebody hearing it

[00:50:19.020 --> 00:50:22.600]
Than trying to talk to our management about anything these people are

[00:50:22.600 --> 00:50:28.660]
Immutable they're impossible. They were hopeless. They're frustrating. They're just they're the worst they don't get crazy people

[00:50:28.660 --> 00:50:31.140]
They just don't get I mean they don't look at your set you know, it's your secret

[00:50:31.140 --> 00:50:36.660]
They don't want to get all they want to do is run up the building and how much money can they put on the books and that's

[00:50:36.660 --> 00:50:42.100]
And Joe Bell thinks he's gonna save his job. I put a lot of billion and maybe he will exactly of course now that they have to pay for the

[00:50:42.100 --> 00:50:44.940]
Doff and Joe Salmary. They're not gonna listen to anybody

[00:50:44.940 --> 00:50:47.280]
Have a good day. Yeah

[00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:50.320]
Thanks, Joel. That was Joel Feinberg. I recognize the voice

[00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:56.840]
But he's right. He's absolutely correct. These people they know everything and I know you've gone through this whole routine

[00:50:56.840 --> 00:50:59.860]
And in fact, I actually listened was it yesterday? I listened for a minute

[00:50:59.860 --> 00:51:03.260]
I don't know why because I never listened. I'm sorry about that and you were talking about oh no

[00:51:03.260 --> 00:51:05.080]
That's when I was trying to get on here and double

[00:51:05.080 --> 00:51:09.120]
They couldn't put me on I was trying to say about the details Kennedy croaking tried to do that again

[00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:14.260]
Would you and and you were going on about the format and about running a tight show and about these people don't understand

[00:51:14.260 --> 00:51:18.040]
Anything about or the production rate and the land that's because those are radio things

[00:51:18.040 --> 00:51:22.500]
I know those don't have anything to do with shirts. I've deported myself radio things

[00:51:22.500 --> 00:51:26.480]
They have to do with broadcasting with a business that were supposedly making our living in

[00:51:27.500 --> 00:51:30.980]
And these aren't radio people including Jala. I don't know what the hell he did

[00:51:30.980 --> 00:51:35.300]
Was he like on a country bumpkin station up there in the Raleigh? What was he doing? I don't know

[00:51:35.940 --> 00:51:38.100]
I know he was on a country bumpkin station in here

[00:51:38.100 --> 00:51:41.160]
He was on kiss and then when Greg Reed got his ass fired

[00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:45.480]
Which he pretended that he wasn't fired when he got his ass fired he was in the building the other day

[00:51:45.480 --> 00:51:49.340]
I hear right. He was in the building. I said no wonder we're all depressed the other day. I don't know exactly

[00:51:49.340 --> 00:51:51.120]
Nobody wants to talk to us

[00:51:52.220 --> 00:51:53.200]
WDQ. YM hello

[00:51:54.860 --> 00:51:55.660]

[00:52:07.620 --> 00:52:09.600]

And what do you want to say now big fan of you

[00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:16.640]
Man, I know and what do you want to say you say you never had a chance to talk to me now?

[00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:19.060]
What do you want to say tell me something? Okay, I love you

[00:52:19.760 --> 00:52:20.120]
Yeah

[00:52:20.120 --> 00:52:25.800]
And that's a call that's a chance to talk to me. I love you. You're not my type pad. You're too old. You're too ugly

[00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:27.080]
Q.A.M. Hello

[00:52:28.140 --> 00:52:34.980]
I hear you Q.A.M. radio personality draft push to if you'd like to trade it sit Rosenberg for

WDQ. YM hello

[00:52:44.200 --> 00:52:45.180]
WDQ. YM hello

[00:52:45.840 --> 00:52:48.640]
Neal I hope that any Jennings is a fair trial

[00:52:49.340 --> 00:52:50.140]
Ken Jennings

[00:52:50.140 --> 00:52:56.300]
Yeah, Ken Jennings is the guy who was on jeopardy that $182,000 Ken Jennings was the sheriff in brownie county

[00:52:56.300 --> 00:52:59.120]
That just resigned. Okay. Can you handle that? Can you spell it?

[00:52:59.300 --> 00:53:04.740]
But you like me to spell it for you sir? Would you like me to insert each letter in your character one and one by side by each

[00:53:06.560 --> 00:53:12.380]
DUM and DUM are Neal talks to morons for hours. That's going to be the new show starting on Monday air every day Monday through Friday

[00:53:12.380 --> 00:53:17.820]
Neal talks to a holes five days a week the DUM are the better and you know what we'll get in we'll get back to the number that way

[00:53:17.820 --> 00:53:21.340]
That's when we had numbers actually if the word ever gets out in fact

[00:53:21.340 --> 00:53:28.400]
I just finally did realize why Joe is screaming so loud as he's thinking that maybe somebody will hear him and they'll realize Joe roses back on a radio

[00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:31.140]
Good thinking Joe

[00:53:33.880 --> 00:53:41.160]
You think that might be something to it? Yeah, yeah, but what are you gonna do? I know what he said about Joyce this morning? I dumped the bitch right now

[00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:46.240]
I know what he said about Joe Rose. I don't have the bitch right now. What he said about clearance? I dumped the bitch right now

[00:53:46.240 --> 00:53:46.960]
I heard all that

[00:53:47.500 --> 00:53:52.780]
Yeah, that's why he's screaming locked because he's hoping that maybe somebody will discover he's back on a radio and they'll tune in

[00:53:54.640 --> 00:53:56.180]
WQAM. Hello

[00:53:58.400 --> 00:53:58.800]
QAM

[00:53:59.520 --> 00:54:01.820]
Hello, Neal how you doing? Okay, sir

[00:54:01.820 --> 00:54:06.840]
Hey, listen a couple months ago. They busted the assault rifle bandage robin bank

[00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:09.960]
The last names were easily two brothers

[00:54:11.220 --> 00:54:14.260]
Yeah, I thought that was interesting. Were they playing the banjo?

[00:54:16.220 --> 00:54:20.140]
Probably loved them all the way if they weren't playing the banjo a different family

[00:54:20.960 --> 00:54:22.220]
WQAM. Hello

[00:54:22.220 --> 00:54:25.920]
This is Joe Rose when I'm in Beverly, Joe Lord

[00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:31.800]
He was he was shouting even on that one recorded spot man. He's shouting and screaming

[00:54:32.500 --> 00:54:35.640]
Screaming maybe because he's so happy to be away from a Joe fine bird

[00:54:35.640 --> 00:54:38.160]
I don't play you Joe

[00:54:39.340 --> 00:54:41.660]
Man is a walking churred

[00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:59.280]
This is where I work. There is never never a dull moment have wallmark. I love walking at wallmark

[00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:04.060]
We say at wallmark way after our ships are over partly because we love it

[00:55:04.060 --> 00:55:06.420]
But mostly cause they lock us in

[00:55:06.420 --> 00:55:09.120]
It's more than a story to a fun place to be

[00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:16.520]
The best thing about being on a wallmark team is not having all those forms and papers that workers with health benefits have to worry about

[00:55:16.520 --> 00:55:18.620]
You never know what you don't find at wallmark

Just come in for the fun. The immigrants are the best at wallmark. They clean our toilets practically for free and wall marks

Here's the menu of what we're having today and this is this is really what they're bringing in all of this today

[00:55:51.400 --> 00:55:54.480]

Which that's the only promotion that I know of so far so nobody see this

[00:56:57.840 --> 00:57:00.140]
This is another part of their insanity on this radio station

[00:57:00.140 --> 00:57:05.940]
They really believe that they can keep shuffling the deck and putting this one on and this and nobody knows about it

[00:57:05.940 --> 00:57:08.320]
Except the people they're preaching to the choir

[00:57:09.540 --> 00:57:12.540]
The only people who know about it are the people we're still listening

[00:57:13.700 --> 00:57:20.020]

Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. I just want to say I'm a big fan of this format hilarious with the calls. Yeah

[00:57:57.520 --> 00:58:01.000]
And you like it. This is this is the format for the future man

[00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:01.720]
Seriously

[00:58:02.460 --> 00:58:06.920]
I am serious. I'm not I'm serious to it. We're talking to bozos. It led to you know

[00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:07.180]
I mean

[00:58:07.180 --> 00:58:10.340]
I'm not gonna solve the problems of the world sitting here reading all of this crap on here

[00:58:10.340 --> 00:58:14.480]
I mean sure it's important stuff of people don't care about it anyway. Why should I waste my time doing that

[00:58:15.140 --> 00:58:21.160]
Exactly. I had a quick downtown Miami report for you. Go ahead still there we get getting worse by the day

[00:58:21.160 --> 00:58:22.980]
home and getting worse and

[00:58:24.060 --> 00:58:29.300]
From what you hear from the county commissioners things are going up getting better every day, but it's not true

[00:58:30.440 --> 00:58:34.460]
Glad to learn. Yeah, good to hear right thanks for the good news, palmy. Bye

[00:58:35.160 --> 00:58:39.900]
Hey, here's more big news and the guy that called was absolutely correct sir Jim DeFeedus

[00:58:39.900 --> 00:58:42.660]
DeFeedus show off W1nz. Wow

[00:58:43.920 --> 00:58:46.500]
Holy moly talk about big things in radio

[00:58:47.840 --> 00:58:52.260]
Jim DeFeedus year-long stint is the morning guy with 940 W1nz is over

[00:58:52.820 --> 00:58:57.260]
This is the same thing that had the story about uh miss Fudge going off of uh his network

[00:58:58.260 --> 00:59:00.540]
sources tell me it says this is from the daily pulp

[00:59:00.540 --> 00:59:03.580]
I don't know who's bloggeless is you know where this is coming from?

[00:59:03.940 --> 00:59:04.040]
Nope

[00:59:04.640 --> 00:59:09.680]
It says it's not clear what happened but his contract expired and rumors are a lot that he's going to another station

[00:59:09.680 --> 00:59:11.080]
Oh no

[00:59:11.820 --> 00:59:13.860]
Jim DeFeedus is going to another station

[00:59:13.860 --> 00:59:21.900]
I spoke with the feces, but he wouldn't talk about what may or may not transpire it says he did at least hit at a radio rebirth however

[00:59:23.380 --> 00:59:23.780]
I

[00:59:23.780 --> 00:59:27.740]
Had a great time at W1nz. I look forward to being on the air at another station very soon

[00:59:27.740 --> 00:59:30.500]
He said you can expect an announcement in the coming days

[00:59:32.180 --> 00:59:36.260]
Sources say the third channel response to the feces leaving the station is rather unceremonious

[00:59:36.260 --> 00:59:44.460]
It removed his name from the 940 W1nz website pull down his pants or pull down his website and knocked him off the program guide and record time according to sources

[00:59:45.280 --> 00:59:47.660]
I hear from one source. It says that the station

[00:59:48.200 --> 00:59:54.180]
After the relationship was severed posted Jim's picture with the W1nz guard station and image I can't help but find hilarious

[00:59:54.180 --> 00:59:56.860]
The feces is on his loose shoe on site

[00:59:58.560 --> 01:00:02.920]
But at the bottom the bottom line is the news appears to be good at least for another local radio and South Florida

[01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:05.960]
Said in that great whoever wrote this thinks it's good because he's gonna be on the years

[01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:10.640]
So this is obviously somebody who's got the mental problems

[01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:15.600]
How do you like that Jim the feces will pop up another station when that pops up

[01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:19.420]
Will be like the Loch Ness monsters to be set up out of the lock

[01:00:21.620 --> 01:00:28.740]
WDQAM. Hello morning. Yes, sir. Hey Neil. I was wondering if I could go by the studio for lunch

Tough question five six seven oh five sixty let's get these phones smoking baby

[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:08.440]
I can see them and I've actually do a little bit of work here. That's not good. That's a bad sign of my advanced age

[01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:12.860]
To try to re-energize this crowd out there and get them back into the swing of things

[01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:16.080]
Jesus got almighty that well what they've done here

[01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:21.340]
I just can't find the words to describe it and the people think oh that Neil man. He's your good scurry to way

[01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:24.980]
Yeah, if you think there's something funny about it. It's pathetic

[01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:29.000]
It's degrading and humiliating and unacceptable, you know

[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:32.800]
And then Norma Kent calls me every now and then tell me about his dogs and stuff like that

[01:01:33.780 --> 01:01:38.240]
Yeah, how they do it not to tell me anything about anything of substance or about how he's gonna go over there and kick

[01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:42.460]
Joe Bell's ass and kick him into groin and try to wake his ass up or do something with clearance

[01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:45.680]

No, anybody who says that I'm hanging up right away

What do you laugh at him? I think you actually might have done that on purpose, but I don't care

[01:01:57.140 --> 01:02:03.920]
I know I know if you say can I talk to you the answer is no you can't because they're gonna hang up on you because only stupid only the dumbest of the dumb

[01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:05.720]

When they got guilty.

is going to show up to feces at the IOD

[01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:56.600]

I feel really left out. I don't need it though. I'm getting fat as a pig and my blood sugar is out of control and really high in the middle of the show.

[01:07:25.660 --> 01:07:30.380]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. If you don't call, you may not be the last one to talk to me before I croak right on the air.

[01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:34.600]
Don't you think whoever speaks to me when I'm croak on the air ought to get like some kind of a prize?

[01:07:35.420 --> 01:07:35.820]
It's what I did.

[01:07:36.260 --> 01:07:37.780]
A date with Greg Reed, something like that.

[01:07:37.780 --> 01:07:46.140]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60 or maybe a date with Jim DeFese's or just the Fese's part and pound 5, 60 on the Verizon Singular Wireless Line.

[01:07:47.980 --> 01:07:49.160]
Who would you cue I am? Hello.

[01:07:50.100 --> 01:07:50.860]
Hey, how you doing?

[01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:51.920]
Okay, sir.

[01:07:53.040 --> 01:07:57.560]
Good. This is Rosenberg on 7.9. That's the same Sid Rosenberg does on F.A. and the New Jersey.

[01:07:58.080 --> 01:07:59.300]
Yeah, he was on with IMS, right?

[01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:00.820]
Keep them.

[01:08:04.580 --> 01:08:05.380]
Wow, what are you saying?

[01:08:06.140 --> 01:08:06.860]
Keep them.

[01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:07.920]
Keep them.

[01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:08.480]
Keep them.

[01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:11.180]
Well, what does that mean?

[01:08:12.260 --> 01:08:16.100]
Keep them. We ain't got them. We don't want them. He ain't that we don't want them.

[01:08:18.440 --> 01:08:19.740]
He's doing New York, he for us.

[01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:21.500]
Nobody cue I am. Hello.

[01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:22.140]
Hey, Neil.

[01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:22.980]
Yes, sir.

[01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:26.680]
Yeah, now that's still 100 is completely falling off the face of the earth.

[01:08:27.140 --> 01:08:29.280]
I hear you're doing some political talk show now.

[01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:30.480]
Yeah, right wing, yeah.

[01:08:30.620 --> 01:08:31.020]
Yeah, what?

[01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:33.520]
And he's not doing voices, right? It's just 10.

[01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:36.380]
I have no idea. No, no, he's not doing the old stick. That is correct.

[01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:42.400]
So how boring would that take? I mean, I couldn't listen to him for more than five minutes without you hearing a Margaret comment.

[01:08:43.200 --> 01:08:44.400]
But let me ask you this.

[01:08:44.760 --> 01:08:44.900]
Yeah.

[01:08:46.300 --> 01:08:49.420]
What differences make his he, are you listening to him now? Is he on the other side?

[01:08:49.420 --> 01:08:51.800]
No, not listening. But, is he on in South Florida?

[01:08:52.180 --> 01:08:53.980]
No, I don't know. He is. I don't think he is.

[01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:54.820]
No, he's not.

[01:08:55.020 --> 01:08:59.380]
Okay, so here's my question to you is, what ever really happened between you and him at the end?

[01:09:00.660 --> 01:09:01.160]
He lied.

[01:09:01.540 --> 01:09:05.540]
Is that what it was? I mean, because I mean, he lied and then he a bad mouthed me and did everything.

[01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:08.360]
He could be a jerk. He just turned out to be a whatever.

[01:09:08.680 --> 01:09:11.540]
I don't know. He just morphed into a jerk. I don't know what that happened to him.

[01:09:11.580 --> 01:09:14.640]
He always said he was a good guy. Not that he was a great personal friend or anything.

[01:09:14.780 --> 01:09:21.500]
But he just, he lied to us when they sold the station to Pax and he lied through his teeth, told us that there was supposed to have a meeting with him

[01:09:21.500 --> 01:09:23.320]
because they were keeping him and going to send a KFI.

[01:09:23.660 --> 01:09:27.720]
And then they told me that he didn't, they didn't show up for the meeting, which was a lie.

[01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:33.900]
Oh, okay. So I know because you guys at cross dresses, I mean, in between and, you know, crossroad, crossroad.

[01:09:33.900 --> 01:09:38.400]
Yeah, we got along great when we were working together. But then once he went a separate way, he decided to do a backstab.

[01:09:38.500 --> 01:09:39.940]
And that's fine. That's up to him. I don't care.

[01:09:40.360 --> 01:09:41.280]
Okay. Thanks.

[01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:44.580]
Okay. Are you sure? I'm sure.

[01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:48.620]
Turned out to be a turd is what I would say. You know, real disappointment.

[01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:50.160]
Better disappointment, wouldn't you agree?

[01:09:51.060 --> 01:09:53.340]
Yeah, it was a, it was a sad chain of events.

[01:09:53.720 --> 01:09:56.860]
Yes. Why be right to? Rick Riley, also the same thing.

[01:09:56.960 --> 01:10:00.660]
Oh, they didn't show up for the meeting. And the meantime, they did show up and they had the meeting.

[01:10:00.700 --> 01:10:05.740]
And they said they were saying the KFI, which is all based in the fact that they had that gigantic Brian Cox lawsuit against him.

[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:11.420]
And they didn't want to turn him loose because they wanted to be able to like squeeze the money out of his, yeah, out of his ass.

[01:10:12.620 --> 01:10:13.500]
W.A.M. Hello.

[01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:14.720]
Hello.

[01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:15.600]
Yes, sir.

[01:10:16.020 --> 01:10:17.100]
Yeah, I need to speak to Neil.

[01:10:18.100 --> 01:10:20.040]
No chance. W.A.M. Hello.

[01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:22.020]
Hey, Uncle Neil. Yes, sir.

[01:10:22.220 --> 01:10:23.320]
Good morning. How are you? Good.

[01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:27.300]
Well, you do have some call call, but I can guarantee there's one call you're not going to get today.

[01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:29.120]
And who's that? Reverend Kennedy.

[01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:30.480]
Yeah.

[01:10:31.260 --> 01:10:31.680]
Thank you.

[01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:32.340]
Thank you.

[01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:33.300]
Thank the Lord. Okay.

[01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:40.420]
Okay. Now, I will say this. We ought to do overs and unders on how many people call each day and say I want to speak to Neil and get hung up on immediately.

[01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:42.740]
That would be good to segment the over and the under.

[01:10:45.300 --> 01:10:49.160]
766. That would be another number for that guy. That says I'm mailing it in, you know, Defoe's boyfriend.

[01:10:49.860 --> 01:10:52.640]
Oh, and you know what? I keep forgetting to talk about it. I don't know if you watched it.

[01:10:52.700 --> 01:10:54.360]
I hope I'm sure you have zeitgeist in movie.

[01:10:54.980 --> 01:10:57.040]
I have a copy to have it watch it yet. I'm very embarrassed.

[01:10:57.100 --> 01:10:59.000]
Oh, you have got to watch that.

[01:10:59.220 --> 01:10:59.640]
Another part.

[01:11:00.420 --> 01:11:03.420]
The first part is a little ponderous where it goes through the anti-religion thing.

[01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:05.760]
And it, you know, it's very excellent stuff.

[01:11:05.900 --> 01:11:07.340]
But I mean, it's stuff that a lot of us already know.

[01:11:08.620 --> 01:11:12.500]
Right. But, but I mean, when you get to the last half of it, it will just knock your socks off.

[01:11:12.500 --> 01:11:14.820]
Even if you're not wearing it. It's just zeitgeist in movie.

[01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:19.120]
There's a link to it on our website, not on qam.com, but on neo-riders.com.

[01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:21.700]
Right above where Brady Quinn is squeezing is a thing.

[01:11:23.260 --> 01:11:27.560]
zeitgeist in movie. Believe you me. You need to see it. Trust me when I tell you. Although most of you won't watch it.

[01:11:27.740 --> 01:11:29.280]
Have somebody else watch it and explain to you?

[01:11:29.800 --> 01:11:30.620]
Deputy QAM. Hello.

[01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:32.700]
Want to speak to Neil?

[01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:34.760]
Deputy QAM. Hello.

[01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:36.840]
QAM. Hola.

[01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:39.280]
Neil. Yeah.

[01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:42.540]
What's your take on Jackson this morning? Did you like him?

[01:11:43.620 --> 01:11:44.320]
WQAM. Hello.

[01:11:44.700 --> 01:11:45.400]
Hey, Neil. How you doing?

[01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:46.120]
Okay.

[01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:50.100]
First of all, still Henry's going in the middle of the night on 9.40.

[01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:51.760]
Two more three o'clock in the morning.

[01:11:52.020 --> 01:11:53.940]
Really? Good time for him. Are you sure?

[01:11:54.300 --> 01:11:54.420]
Yeah.

[01:11:54.900 --> 01:12:04.800]
Second thing is, have you and your lifetime ever seen a bigger rape of the government in terms of money than under this administration in eight years?

[01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:05.860]
Of course not.

[01:12:06.500 --> 01:12:07.300]
It's in.

[01:12:07.540 --> 01:12:10.740]
Outside of the role and people don't even talk about it.

[01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:11.480]
It's in.

[01:12:11.660 --> 01:12:15.160]
They destroyed the whole economy. The dollar isn't worth a nickel anymore.

[01:12:15.300 --> 01:12:18.180]
And they destroyed the whole American economy and they're spending trillions of dollars.

[01:12:18.500 --> 01:12:21.340]
And everybody's back like, move them like this Fred Thompson's on TV.

[01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:23.220]
So he's running for president. What do you do?

[01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:28.440]
Well, here's the most amazing thing is when the Hillary or Obama raised like millions of dollars.

[01:12:28.860 --> 01:12:31.360]
And they get all crazy about them raising millions of dollars.

[01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:33.180]
And he's got such brilliant.

[01:12:33.680 --> 01:12:33.920]
Yeah.

[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.360]
Who's getting all crazy about them raising millions of dollars?

[01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:40.560]
Well, when you hear, oh my god, it's the biggest fun raise or ever Obama.

[01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:40.760]
Yeah.

[01:12:40.900 --> 01:12:42.600]
It's already million bucks or whatever.

[01:12:43.180 --> 01:12:44.440]
And meanwhile, so what's wrong with that?

[01:12:44.540 --> 01:12:46.800]
In other words, only fascists can raise money to run for office.

[01:12:46.940 --> 01:12:50.760]
I think, yeah, what's good for the goose is good to take a gander at.

[01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:53.500]
Oh, there's a bubble.

[01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:53.820]
Never.

[01:12:54.040 --> 01:12:56.600]
What is going to save the world if Al Gore can't do it.

[01:12:56.600 --> 01:12:58.100]
And if I was going to chime in there and do it.

[01:12:58.320 --> 01:13:01.280]
Oh, see that 2008, 2008.

[01:13:04.060 --> 01:13:05.260]
Even you could have kept it on.

[01:13:05.580 --> 01:13:06.760]
I got another one.

[01:13:09.300 --> 01:13:11.940]
There is the luckiest man on the face of the earth.

[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:13.100]
Even Rick Shaw agree with that.

[01:13:13.160 --> 01:13:14.400]
I remember that and he didn't like to knock anybody.

[01:13:15.020 --> 01:13:17.740]
But I managed to squeeze a little shot out of him out of the Larry, you know.

[01:13:18.220 --> 01:13:19.660]
Luckiest man on the face of the globe.

[01:13:21.260 --> 01:13:22.900]
You did a lot of things.

[01:13:23.620 --> 01:13:23.660]
Five.

[01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:28.860]
You Rogers on Sportshold Radio WQL.

[01:13:33.580 --> 01:13:36.060]
This is CNN, breaking news.

[01:13:36.460 --> 01:13:40.080]
Senator Larry Craig is denying any wrongdoing despite a guilty plea

[01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:42.500]
stemming from an incident in an airport men's room.

[01:13:42.760 --> 01:13:44.180]
Senator Craig, thanks for the interview.

[01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:45.320]
Do I know you?

[01:13:45.540 --> 01:13:46.680]
Have I met you before?

[01:13:46.680 --> 01:13:48.500]
No, don't think we've met.

[01:13:48.980 --> 01:13:50.720]
And could you get your hand off my knee?

[01:13:50.860 --> 01:13:53.680]
I'm gay and I close and I get on this.

[01:13:53.900 --> 01:13:54.900]
Not interested, Senator.

[01:13:55.520 --> 01:13:57.020]
So how do you pick up guys?

[01:13:57.400 --> 01:13:58.120]
I make eye contact.

[01:13:58.560 --> 01:13:59.560]
I smile at people.

[01:13:59.700 --> 01:14:00.760]
They recognize me.

[01:14:00.760 --> 01:14:03.340]
I go around anywhere hitting on man.

[01:14:03.700 --> 01:14:03.740]
Okay.

[01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:05.160]
Here's one thing I do.

[01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:06.760]
I seek and ask.

[01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:08.760]
Oh, they trickle advice, Senator.

[01:14:08.820 --> 01:14:12.840]
I hope Idaho will allow me to continue serving gay people

[01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:13.680]
at the Minneapolis airport.

[01:14:14.570 --> 01:14:16.030]
CNN, breaking news.

[01:14:16.650 --> 01:14:18.530]
Yeah, I've break the 785 on our pool.

[01:14:18.610 --> 01:14:20.610]
We're going to have over 800 by the top of the hour.

[01:14:20.750 --> 01:14:21.250]
And peace of cake.

[01:14:21.410 --> 01:14:23.690]
And top of the hour we start with the river house.

[01:14:25.050 --> 01:14:28.770]
Here's an article from July 31st, 2005.

[01:14:30.250 --> 01:14:31.710]
And you probably wonder, what is it from?

[01:14:31.950 --> 01:14:32.810]
And you know, it's from the hero.

[01:14:33.130 --> 01:14:33.530]
From the hero.

[01:14:35.510 --> 01:14:36.150]
Sarah Tallahle.

[01:14:36.150 --> 01:14:36.870]
Remember her, Chris?

[01:14:38.230 --> 01:14:38.550]
Who?

[01:14:38.650 --> 01:14:38.790]
No.

[01:14:39.250 --> 01:14:40.090]
You don't read the newspaper.

[01:14:40.590 --> 01:14:40.950]
Yeah, I do.

[01:14:40.950 --> 01:14:44.430]
It said, as the two largest sports radio stations in South Florida,

[01:14:44.550 --> 01:14:45.330]
what they think of each other.

[01:14:45.410 --> 01:14:46.910]
And just like on here, they don't hold back.

[01:14:47.330 --> 01:14:50.370]
Veteran WQAim dismisses its newest challenger, 790 to ticket.

[01:14:50.690 --> 01:14:53.650]
We consider ourselves more authoritative and experienced than them as

[01:14:53.650 --> 01:14:57.390]
silly and amateurish as Greg Reed, WQAim's vice president and general manager.

[01:14:58.370 --> 01:15:02.230]
He saved his harshest critique for Daniel Labbastruz afternoon show on 790.

[01:15:02.670 --> 01:15:04.870]
Our guys at the station call it Sissy Boy Radio.

[01:15:05.590 --> 01:15:07.670]
It's a bunch of girlish type topics.

[01:15:07.890 --> 01:15:09.770]
It's not really serious sports talk.

[01:15:09.770 --> 01:15:11.930]
Yeah, Greg, maybe that's why they're kicking our ass.

[01:15:12.130 --> 01:15:13.270]
It's not serious sports talk.

[01:15:13.550 --> 01:15:14.910]
It's girly talk.

[01:15:15.830 --> 01:15:16.710]
Labbastruz chuckled.

[01:15:16.850 --> 01:15:18.030]
It's nice to see his listening.

[01:15:18.110 --> 01:15:21.750]
He said, I would say Sissy Boy Radio is preferable to old white nursing home

[01:15:21.750 --> 01:15:23.550]
century village fossilized radio.

[01:15:23.790 --> 01:15:24.230]
Wow.

[01:15:24.610 --> 01:15:26.070]
Who could he be talking about there?

[01:15:27.230 --> 01:15:28.070]
Still good.

[01:15:28.590 --> 01:15:29.490]
Welcome to the sports talk.

[01:15:29.650 --> 01:15:30.650]
Radio wars in South Florida.

[01:15:30.650 --> 01:15:31.950]
It says we're 790 to ticket.

[01:15:32.150 --> 01:15:34.390]
His launch the first significant challenge in WQAim.

[01:15:34.390 --> 01:15:37.350]
The station is dominating the sports landscape for more than a decade.

[01:15:37.790 --> 01:15:41.130]
But it'll be a bit about a bit about the big red weed says it.

[01:15:41.310 --> 01:15:42.230]
Of course, he's long gone.

[01:15:43.650 --> 01:15:46.330]
But you said he was in the building yesterday flashing around his new suit.

[01:15:48.250 --> 01:15:48.630]
Correct.

[01:15:49.030 --> 01:15:49.890]
And then what you said?

[01:15:52.350 --> 01:15:53.350]
5667.0560, 0.560.

[01:15:54.390 --> 01:15:57.290]
And I'm thinking about this business, about Mole and about Jim DeFese.

[01:15:57.570 --> 01:15:59.370]
And like I said, it's like a deck of cards.

[01:15:59.610 --> 01:16:03.210]
Just keep shuffling the deck with the same cards over and over and over again.

[01:16:03.510 --> 01:16:06.070]
And spread the cards out all over the table and guess what?

[01:16:06.070 --> 01:16:08.190]
Every time it's all the same cards.

[01:16:08.190 --> 01:16:11.450]
They may be in a different order, but it's the same cards.

[01:16:11.450 --> 01:16:12.090]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:16:13.010 --> 01:16:14.410]
And then that's this radio market.

[01:16:14.510 --> 01:16:18.210]
That's just recycling the same old stuff over and over and over again.

[01:16:19.490 --> 01:16:21.270]
Jim DeFese is my god.

[01:16:23.710 --> 01:16:24.410]
WQAim, hello.

[01:16:24.950 --> 01:16:25.930]
Hey, how you doing, pal?

[01:16:26.410 --> 01:16:26.850]
Okay, sir.

[01:16:27.290 --> 01:16:27.950]
Two things.

[01:16:28.730 --> 01:16:36.050]
The CDC has admitted that the human pavalon of virus has mutated and if he's going to be dead,

[01:16:36.050 --> 01:16:37.450]
he's going to be killed.

[01:16:38.270 --> 01:16:45.210]
And his school has 45 partners a year that they can get throat cancer.

[01:16:46.030 --> 01:16:47.090]
That's one thing.

[01:16:47.330 --> 01:16:50.310]
And how come when you turn down your street down here in Parkland?

[01:16:50.590 --> 01:16:52.850]
I mean, not in Parkland over in Plantation acres.

[01:16:53.070 --> 01:16:55.190]
There's like a guy who's got a KTK hot.

[01:16:55.610 --> 01:16:58.630]
That looks like he's an osteovalid or seminal indian there.

[01:17:02.350 --> 01:17:04.150]
What is this man talking about?

[01:17:04.250 --> 01:17:04.770]
Oh, please.

[01:17:04.770 --> 01:17:05.870]
Yes, staff.

[01:17:06.330 --> 01:17:07.630]
I'm going to fire it.

[01:17:07.810 --> 01:17:11.170]
Yeah, staff my street and quit the rapin teenagers.

[01:17:12.230 --> 01:17:12.990]
WQAim, hello.

[01:17:14.850 --> 01:17:15.850]
QAM, hello.

[01:17:15.850 --> 01:17:17.770]
Good morning.

[01:17:18.210 --> 01:17:18.810]
Good morning.

[01:17:19.450 --> 01:17:20.370]
How are you guys today?

[01:17:20.810 --> 01:17:21.110]
Okay.

[01:17:21.270 --> 01:17:21.610]
How are you?

[01:17:22.090 --> 01:17:22.750]
Very, very good.

[01:17:22.950 --> 01:17:24.710]
I want to introduce Neo to the monave.

[01:17:26.490 --> 01:17:27.750]
You want to introduce who?

[01:17:28.870 --> 01:17:29.150]
Neo.

[01:17:29.670 --> 01:17:30.870]
Who do you think you're talking to?

[01:17:31.010 --> 01:17:31.290]
Schmuck.

[01:17:31.810 --> 01:17:32.510]
Another idiot.

[01:17:32.510 --> 01:17:34.190]
560, 560.

[01:17:35.430 --> 01:17:37.910]
Pound 560 on the Verizon singular wireless line.

[01:17:38.330 --> 01:17:41.190]
So many stupid, stupid, stupiding.

[01:17:41.210 --> 01:17:41.430]
You know what?

[01:17:41.530 --> 01:17:41.950]
It's great.

[01:17:42.670 --> 01:17:43.010]
It's great.

[01:17:44.170 --> 01:17:44.630]
Yeah, it is.

[01:17:44.830 --> 01:17:45.170]
It's really great.

[01:17:45.750 --> 01:17:46.530]
Now what do you eat now?

[01:17:46.750 --> 01:17:47.210]
Yellowfin tuna.

[01:17:47.770 --> 01:17:48.470]
Yellowfin tuna.

[01:17:48.650 --> 01:17:49.510]
Now what about these desserts?

[01:17:49.730 --> 01:17:50.530]
The chocolate cheesecake?

[01:17:50.810 --> 01:17:51.230]
Oh, God.

[01:17:51.570 --> 01:17:52.370]
With cashew bar.

[01:17:52.390 --> 01:17:52.750]
I know.

[01:17:53.210 --> 01:17:54.190]
Chocolate mousse.

[01:17:54.650 --> 01:17:55.430]
And chocolate pyramid.

[01:17:55.830 --> 01:17:56.130]
What is it?

[01:17:56.230 --> 01:17:56.770]
Chocolate pyramid.

[01:17:56.890 --> 01:17:57.570]
Are there like Egyptians?

[01:17:58.010 --> 01:17:58.110]
Yeah.

[01:17:58.310 --> 01:17:58.770]
It's a pyramid.

[01:17:58.770 --> 01:18:00.210]
Made of a different kind of chocolate.

[01:18:00.370 --> 01:18:02.930]
Like the deeper you go into it, the crazier the chocolate gets.

[01:18:03.610 --> 01:18:05.430]
It's like a mousse.

[01:18:05.650 --> 01:18:06.170]
What do you call it?

[01:18:06.270 --> 01:18:06.710]
What's in there?

[01:18:08.070 --> 01:18:08.710]
Moose nougat.

[01:18:08.850 --> 01:18:09.770]
It's got some ganache in it.

[01:18:10.330 --> 01:18:11.250]
No, it's not the ganache.

[01:18:11.390 --> 01:18:13.850]
It's not the sound of the nickname could be like Matt Fudge.

[01:18:17.950 --> 01:18:18.810]
789 on a pole.

[01:18:18.870 --> 01:18:20.050]
We're almost to 800, baby.

[01:18:20.130 --> 01:18:20.870]
Whatever the hell that means.

[01:18:20.990 --> 01:18:22.050]
I have no idea what that means.

[01:18:22.230 --> 01:18:23.990]
So the feces is coming back.

[01:18:24.470 --> 01:18:25.690]
And Mo maybe making a comeback.

[01:18:26.450 --> 01:18:27.330]
I sure have all the rumors.

[01:18:27.510 --> 01:18:28.450]
I sure hope that one is true.

[01:18:28.450 --> 01:18:32.950]
What do they tell us something that's like interesting or is going to make a difference in our lives?

[01:18:34.130 --> 01:18:35.230]
When does that going to start?

[01:18:35.370 --> 01:18:36.370]
When does that show start?

[01:18:36.510 --> 01:18:36.650]
Yeah.

[01:18:37.150 --> 01:18:37.710]
On what station?

[01:18:38.490 --> 01:18:39.490]
W-Q-A-N-Hello.

[01:18:39.930 --> 01:18:40.530]
Hey Neil.

[01:18:41.130 --> 01:18:41.250]
Yeah.

[01:18:41.690 --> 01:18:42.750]
You work better alone.

[01:18:44.230 --> 01:18:44.650]
Oh.

[01:18:45.230 --> 01:18:45.970]
Q-A-N-Hello.

[01:18:46.050 --> 01:18:46.770]
Another George Scott.

[01:18:47.050 --> 01:18:47.950]
Q-A-N-Hello.

[01:18:48.830 --> 01:18:49.270]
Hello.

[01:18:49.450 --> 01:18:52.530]
I heard Phil Henry on WBZT a Saturday night.

[01:18:52.950 --> 01:18:53.550]
Yeah, and.

[01:18:54.010 --> 01:18:56.710]
And he's doing his regular show there on the Palm Beach Station.

[01:18:57.550 --> 01:18:59.270]
What do you mean he's doing his regular show?

[01:18:59.430 --> 01:18:59.910]
What does that mean?

[01:19:00.130 --> 01:19:03.010]
He's not doing any kind of stick or anything just a regular show.

[01:19:03.190 --> 01:19:05.190]
It's picked the place of Odbell.

[01:19:05.770 --> 01:19:07.130]
Yeah, he's doing right-wing crap.

[01:19:07.430 --> 01:19:09.350]
Yeah, but he's doing the Odbell time slot.

[01:19:10.130 --> 01:19:10.490]
Yeah.

[01:19:10.850 --> 01:19:12.430]
And that's what he's doing up in Palm Beach.

[01:19:12.430 --> 01:19:13.690]
I don't know what he's doing on INZ.

[01:19:13.810 --> 01:19:14.590]
I can't get that speech.

[01:19:14.790 --> 01:19:16.210]
Well, what do you mean what he's doing on INZ?

[01:19:16.330 --> 01:19:18.690]
In other words, you think he's doing a different show on another station?

[01:19:18.950 --> 01:19:19.030]
No.

[01:19:19.090 --> 01:19:19.730]
Man, oh man.

[01:19:19.850 --> 01:19:20.370]
Like I said.

[01:19:22.170 --> 01:19:22.530]
Whoa.

[01:19:23.070 --> 01:19:24.810]
Yeah, he's on 15 different stations.

[01:19:24.810 --> 01:19:26.510]
And he's doing 15 different shows, sir.

[01:19:26.990 --> 01:19:28.750]
Every station he's on, he's doing something different.

[01:19:29.030 --> 01:19:30.390]
He's doing Margaret on one station.

[01:19:30.690 --> 01:19:32.490]
He's doing Bob Green on another one.

[01:19:36.830 --> 01:19:38.470]
Seriously, and we're going to have an election.

[01:19:39.430 --> 01:19:41.350]
We're going to have a presidential election there.

[01:19:41.490 --> 01:19:42.530]
And these people are going to vote.

[01:19:45.030 --> 01:19:45.430]
Wow.

[01:19:46.410 --> 01:19:48.030]
Eight more troops died yesterday in Iraq.

[01:19:48.290 --> 01:19:48.870]
Does anyone...

[01:19:48.870 --> 01:19:50.350]
Now it's like an afterthought on the news.

[01:19:50.530 --> 01:19:52.410]
It's like, well, you know, it's too depressing.

[01:19:52.710 --> 01:19:53.250]
It's bad news.

[01:19:53.250 --> 01:19:54.110]
It's hot as hell.

[01:19:54.170 --> 01:19:55.330]
People don't want to get all depressed, right?

[01:19:55.570 --> 01:19:57.290]
So they don't even talk about it.

[01:19:58.990 --> 01:20:00.130]
W-Q-A-M, hello.

[01:20:00.870 --> 01:20:01.210]
Yeah.

[01:20:02.130 --> 01:20:02.130]

[01:20:02.230 --> 01:20:03.190]
It's a Silver Spoon Kid.

[01:20:04.110 --> 01:20:04.330]
Yeah.

[01:20:04.730 --> 01:20:05.310]
What's that, dude?

[01:20:05.750 --> 01:20:06.710]
What does that mean, boy, God?

[01:20:07.130 --> 01:20:07.490]
Fineberg.

[01:20:08.870 --> 01:20:09.590]
What about him?

[01:20:10.070 --> 01:20:10.490]
It's me.

[01:20:11.170 --> 01:20:11.770]
Yeah, sure.

[01:20:12.090 --> 01:20:12.990]
What are we going to pickle about?

[01:20:17.250 --> 01:20:17.610]
Shmuck.

[01:20:17.850 --> 01:20:18.550]
You don't think it's me?

[01:20:19.050 --> 01:20:19.330]
No.

[01:20:19.610 --> 01:20:20.510]
And what if it was you?

[01:20:20.570 --> 01:20:21.250]
Wouldn't that be pathetic?

[01:20:21.750 --> 01:20:22.470]
It would be pathetic.

[01:20:22.670 --> 01:20:23.230]
I mean, you're a person.

[01:20:23.230 --> 01:20:23.230]

[01:20:23.230 --> 01:20:23.230]

[01:20:23.230 --> 01:20:23.230]

[01:20:23.230 --> 01:20:23.230]

[01:20:23.230 --> 01:20:26.210]
You're pathetic enough of it is you, but it doesn't sound like a Joel Fineberg.

[01:20:26.530 --> 01:20:28.750]
But if it was you'd be pathetic enough to be called in this show.

[01:20:29.070 --> 01:20:29.570]
Oh, come on.

[01:20:29.690 --> 01:20:30.730]
I love listening to you.

[01:20:30.830 --> 01:20:31.730]
Yeah, well, I know that.

[01:20:31.930 --> 01:20:32.470]
That's obvious.

[01:20:32.930 --> 01:20:33.930]
So you don't want to make it...

[01:20:33.930 --> 01:20:35.430]
What kind of a deal you want to make, Joel?

[01:20:36.050 --> 01:20:36.770]
I'm ready when you are.

[01:20:37.190 --> 01:20:37.470]
Yeah.

[01:20:37.630 --> 01:20:38.190]
Ready for what?

[01:20:38.550 --> 01:20:38.750]
You.

[01:20:39.350 --> 01:20:39.630]
Yeah.

[01:20:40.290 --> 01:20:40.810]
Guess what?

[01:20:41.050 --> 01:20:41.570]
Bend over, buddy.

[01:20:43.530 --> 01:20:44.810]
Five, six, seven, oh, five, sixteen.

[01:20:45.070 --> 01:20:45.770]
You know, that could have been him.

[01:20:45.850 --> 01:20:47.730]
I don't know, because he's enough of a pucks that might have been him.

[01:20:47.910 --> 01:20:49.070]
He's probably sitting there with...

[01:20:49.070 --> 01:20:51.250]
Probably half of the calls we can get are from over there anyway.

[01:20:52.290 --> 01:20:52.610]
Probably.

[01:20:53.210 --> 01:20:55.970]
We say no, realize that they're doing us a big favor.

[01:20:57.450 --> 01:20:59.830]
And look at how many votes we got on the pool now, 790.

[01:21:00.190 --> 01:21:01.030]
Oh, my God.

[01:21:01.110 --> 01:21:01.530]
Oh, my God.

[01:21:01.670 --> 01:21:01.830]
Wow.

[01:21:02.450 --> 01:21:03.550]
Oh, my God.

[01:21:03.730 --> 01:21:03.970]
What's this?

[01:21:04.730 --> 01:21:05.730]
Yeah, I don't think so.

[01:21:06.070 --> 01:21:07.750]
I think it's an act of God, you know?

[01:21:07.910 --> 01:21:08.610]
Damn God.

[01:21:09.030 --> 01:21:09.870]
So put it in the paper.

[01:21:10.010 --> 01:21:11.610]
Joel Fineberg calls it in the eruditor show.

[01:21:11.690 --> 01:21:12.450]
That didn't sound like him.

[01:21:12.550 --> 01:21:12.970]
Sound like one.

[01:21:13.110 --> 01:21:14.050]
Maybe it was, I don't know.

[01:21:14.190 --> 01:21:15.290]
It could be.

[01:21:15.370 --> 01:21:16.770]
He's dumb enough to pull a stunt like that.

[01:21:16.890 --> 01:21:18.630]
I mean, here's a real classy guy, you know.

[01:21:19.510 --> 01:21:22.750]
This is the same guy that called up Greg Read and left him a message on his voicemail.

[01:21:22.870 --> 01:21:26.770]
Oh, we're not going to force you to like overpay Bo Camper, because we have no interest in him.

[01:21:27.470 --> 01:21:30.770]
So we're not going to do like we did with management with Hank and force you to overpay

[01:21:30.770 --> 01:21:31.970]
and get you into a bidding war.

[01:21:32.250 --> 01:21:33.930]
Don't overpay him because we don't want him anyway.

[01:21:34.230 --> 01:21:36.110]
And he's a message on Greg Read's voicemail.

[01:21:36.230 --> 01:21:36.630]
Remember that?

[01:21:37.390 --> 01:21:37.850]
Sure do.

[01:21:38.570 --> 01:21:41.450]
Now that was a good match there, Joel Fineberg and Greg Read.

[01:21:41.670 --> 01:21:41.990]
Yeah, Lloyd.

[01:21:42.330 --> 01:21:45.090]
I don't know what kind of suits Joel, where it's going to never had a chance to meet him.

[01:21:45.370 --> 01:21:46.070]
I'm sure they're expensive.

[01:21:46.390 --> 01:21:47.090]
Now what do you say?

[01:21:47.210 --> 01:21:48.450]
We're going to stick his pickle in the barrel?

[01:21:49.030 --> 01:21:49.810]
You're not my angel.

[01:21:49.970 --> 01:21:50.150]
You're a barrel.

[01:21:50.970 --> 01:21:51.910]
No, you're not a barrel.

[01:21:52.110 --> 01:21:52.430]
I'm a barrel.

[01:21:52.890 --> 01:21:54.650]
Neil, I want to apologize to you buddy.

[01:21:55.090 --> 01:21:55.450]
For what?

[01:21:56.230 --> 01:21:58.510]
But I know it was you the last time I called.

[01:21:58.890 --> 01:22:00.430]
Yeah, well, what did you want to say last time?

[01:22:01.130 --> 01:22:02.010]
About the Mona V.

[01:22:02.190 --> 01:22:03.010]
You need to drink it.

[01:22:03.430 --> 01:22:04.090]
What is that?

[01:22:04.810 --> 01:22:05.470]
It's a food juice.

[01:22:05.630 --> 01:22:06.750]
It has 19 different kinds of food.

[01:22:06.750 --> 01:22:07.410]
Yeah, well good.

[01:22:07.570 --> 01:22:08.190]
Stick it, baby.

[01:22:08.390 --> 01:22:09.270]
Stick it in Joel Fineberg.

[01:22:09.390 --> 01:22:09.530]
Exactly.

[01:22:09.810 --> 01:22:10.470]
Get out of my face.

[01:22:12.270 --> 01:22:14.530]
I'm really amazed that the cereal guy hasn't called again.

[01:22:14.530 --> 01:22:15.130]
He'll be on.

[01:22:15.350 --> 01:22:16.370]
And you know who else hasn't called?

[01:22:16.670 --> 01:22:17.970]
The quarter slots guy from Vegas.

[01:22:18.350 --> 01:22:19.870]
We only have the S&P guy.

[01:22:20.210 --> 01:22:21.890]
Let's take a look at the S&P, okay?

[01:22:22.810 --> 01:22:23.830]
S&P is up today.

[01:22:24.030 --> 01:22:24.990]
The S&P is up today.

[01:22:25.310 --> 01:22:28.150]
Oh, the S&P is up 6 and 1 quarter.

[01:22:28.270 --> 01:22:28.790]
How do you like that?

[01:22:28.970 --> 01:22:29.430]
Aren't you excited?

[01:22:30.270 --> 01:22:35.990]
And the euro is up to $137 against the inept American dollar, the pathetic American dollar.

[01:22:36.090 --> 01:22:36.930]
We're the diamond.

[01:22:38.830 --> 01:22:42.250]
Don't tell Joel that all of Daddy's money ain't worth squat anymore because the dollar's worth.

[01:22:42.250 --> 01:22:43.570]
Well, you know, just stay right there.

[01:22:43.670 --> 01:22:44.110]
It'll be okay.

[01:22:45.690 --> 01:22:46.230]
WDQAM, hello.

[01:22:46.950 --> 01:22:48.830]
Just stand over the trade wire.

[01:22:50.010 --> 01:22:50.570]
WDQAM, hello.

[01:22:51.710 --> 01:22:52.250]
Hello, Neil.

[01:22:52.810 --> 01:22:53.110]
Yes, sir.

[01:22:54.250 --> 01:22:56.210]
What is your pick of the dolphin game this week?

[01:22:56.770 --> 01:22:57.510]
What do I think?

[01:22:57.670 --> 01:22:58.870]
I don't think of the dolphins at all.

[01:23:00.150 --> 01:23:00.570]
What's that?

[01:23:01.170 --> 01:23:01.750]
Let me say it again.

[01:23:01.870 --> 01:23:02.350]
I don't.

[01:23:02.350 --> 01:23:02.830]
I don't think.

[01:23:02.970 --> 01:23:03.410]
I don't care.

[01:23:03.530 --> 01:23:04.510]
I couldn't give a crap less.

[01:23:04.710 --> 01:23:05.430]
Is that answer your question?

[01:23:06.190 --> 01:23:07.550]
You're going to give a sports radio?

[01:23:08.050 --> 01:23:08.270]
No.

[01:23:09.010 --> 01:23:09.390]
It is.

[01:23:09.730 --> 01:23:10.070]
No.

[01:23:10.550 --> 01:23:11.170]
It is.

[01:23:11.170 --> 01:23:12.530]
Let me say it again.

[01:23:12.750 --> 01:23:13.410]
N-O.

[01:23:13.650 --> 01:23:13.910]
No.

[01:23:14.570 --> 01:23:14.730]
No.

[01:23:14.890 --> 01:23:15.070]
No.

[01:23:15.390 --> 01:23:15.650]
No.

[01:23:18.390 --> 01:23:21.050]
56670560, pound 560 on a Verizon singular wireless line.

[01:23:21.290 --> 01:23:22.870]
It's all sports radio, sir.

[01:23:23.190 --> 01:23:24.430]
You've got your R in there.

[01:23:24.590 --> 01:23:25.430]
Take the R out.

[01:23:25.690 --> 01:23:25.690]

[01:23:25.950 --> 01:23:26.070]
R.

[01:23:26.610 --> 01:23:26.910]
Yeah.

[01:23:27.090 --> 01:23:28.930]
We are all sports radio.

[01:23:29.350 --> 01:23:32.330]
If you don't believe me, listen to the Joe Roachhead tomorrow morning with the Kimmy shorts.

[01:23:33.430 --> 01:23:34.130]
What's the guy's name again?

[01:23:34.310 --> 01:23:34.970]
Keith Jackson.

[01:23:35.170 --> 01:23:35.690]
Jason Jackson.

[01:23:36.090 --> 01:23:36.630]
I'll get it.

[01:23:37.210 --> 01:23:38.850]
I don't know why I have such a difficulty with his name.

[01:23:38.990 --> 01:23:39.710]
I don't know what that's all about.

[01:23:39.710 --> 01:23:41.810]
He sounds a little bit like the big rock solid.

[01:23:41.890 --> 01:23:42.270]
Oh, to me.

[01:23:42.350 --> 01:23:43.210]
Don't they sound very similar?

[01:23:43.810 --> 01:23:43.930]
Yeah.

[01:23:44.490 --> 01:23:46.630]
Without the Spanish baby talk.

[01:23:47.710 --> 01:23:48.410]
Somebody QAM?

[01:23:48.470 --> 01:23:48.610]
Hello.

[01:23:50.550 --> 01:23:50.950]
QAM?

[01:23:50.990 --> 01:23:51.110]
Hola.

[01:23:51.590 --> 01:23:52.030]
You got here.

[01:23:52.670 --> 01:23:53.210]
Hey, Neil.

[01:23:53.610 --> 01:23:54.010]
Yes, sir.

[01:23:55.030 --> 01:23:56.890]
Hey, you've dealt with it by the Dennis Miller show.

[01:23:57.550 --> 01:23:58.010]
Oh, yeah.

[01:23:59.470 --> 01:24:00.570]
I was listening to him.

[01:24:00.590 --> 01:24:01.070]
He's pretty good.

[01:24:01.610 --> 01:24:01.970]
You know what?

[01:24:02.130 --> 01:24:02.590]
Dennis Miller.

[01:24:02.750 --> 01:24:04.670]
You couldn't find his number with a search party.

[01:24:05.290 --> 01:24:06.070]
He sucks.

[01:24:06.950 --> 01:24:07.450]
Yeah, okay.

[01:24:08.490 --> 01:24:08.890]
Yeah.

[01:24:08.890 --> 01:24:10.130]
I feel really threatened, baby.

[01:24:10.430 --> 01:24:13.050]
That's what I worry about every day when I wake up in the morning.

[01:24:13.050 --> 01:24:14.850]
I think I'm like, oh, my God.

[01:24:14.870 --> 01:24:16.430]
Who are they going to put it on against me now?

[01:24:16.610 --> 01:24:17.270]
I'm threatened.

[01:24:17.470 --> 01:24:18.030]
I'm really worried about.

[01:24:18.270 --> 01:24:19.830]
Paychecks showed up five days early, sir.

[01:24:19.990 --> 01:24:20.970]
That's all I care about.

[01:24:21.670 --> 01:24:23.590]
Just keep putting the money in the bank, baby.

[01:24:23.710 --> 01:24:25.330]
Keep putting the money in the old bank.

[01:24:26.670 --> 01:24:27.030]
Wonderful.

[01:24:27.670 --> 01:24:27.910]
Oh, shred it.

[01:24:28.130 --> 01:24:29.890]
Maybe that gym defecis of the I know.

[01:24:30.170 --> 01:24:30.550]
I'm 16.

[01:24:32.130 --> 01:24:35.990]
Mark Morgan is the 12 to 1 hour on QAM.

[01:24:36.350 --> 01:24:37.170]
Good morning, Americans.

[01:24:37.470 --> 01:24:38.430]
It's Paul Harvey.

[01:24:38.430 --> 01:24:39.870]
Stand by for news.

[01:24:40.570 --> 01:24:45.290]
A young technician and his general manager, Bob, boarded a train heading

[01:24:45.290 --> 01:24:47.670]
through the mountains on its way to Warchiton.

[01:24:48.350 --> 01:24:51.970]
They sat right across the aisle from Linda and her grandmother.

[01:24:52.930 --> 01:24:57.370]
Well, after a while it was obvious that Linda and John were interested in each other because

[01:24:57.370 --> 01:25:00.130]
they were giving each other the look.

[01:25:01.490 --> 01:25:04.390]
Soon the train passed through a tunnel and it became pitch black.

[01:25:04.390 --> 01:25:07.950]
There was a sound of kissing followed by the sound of a slap.

[01:25:08.550 --> 01:25:13.070]
When the train emerged from the tunnel before sat silently without saying a word.

[01:25:13.790 --> 01:25:19.270]
The grandmother was thinking to herself it was very brush for that young man to kiss my granddaughter,

[01:25:19.510 --> 01:25:21.670]
but I'm glad Linda slapped him.

[01:25:22.390 --> 01:25:27.370]
The general manager, Bob, is sitting there thinking I didn't know John was brave enough to kiss that girl,

[01:25:27.390 --> 01:25:31.610]
but I sure was she hadn't missed him when she slapped and hit me.

[01:25:32.350 --> 01:25:36.930]
Linda was thinking I'm glad the guy kissed me, but I wish my grandmother hadn't slapped him.

[01:25:37.490 --> 01:25:42.790]
And John sat there with a satisfying smile on his face and thought life is good.

[01:25:43.430 --> 01:25:51.010]
How often does a guy get the chance to kiss a beautiful girl and slap his general manager all in the same day, Paul Harvey?

[01:25:51.250 --> 01:25:51.610]
Good day.

[01:25:52.350 --> 01:25:53.070]
Good day.

[01:25:53.190 --> 01:25:54.770]
I just had a great programming idea.

[01:25:54.910 --> 01:25:55.510]
What do you think of this?

[01:25:56.550 --> 01:25:58.810]
Joel Feinberg is his own regular segment on the show.

[01:25:58.890 --> 01:26:01.910]
That seems to be really big on the station through Rosenstein's gutters.

[01:26:02.170 --> 01:26:03.670]
As long as he can get a sponsor.

[01:26:04.290 --> 01:26:06.530]
He tells Joel and then Joel does a live spot.

[01:26:06.930 --> 01:26:09.850]
He texted me and said that you're a word we can't say on the air.

[01:26:11.090 --> 01:26:12.710]
But it starts with an an end with a hole.

[01:26:13.970 --> 01:26:14.950]
What are you talking about?

[01:26:15.870 --> 01:26:19.270]
Joel texted me and told me to tell you that you're a hole.

[01:26:20.790 --> 01:26:23.670]
And I texted back and I said I think he already knows that.

[01:26:24.250 --> 01:26:25.310]
What about it, Joel?

[01:26:25.910 --> 01:26:26.970]
Tell me more about it.

[01:26:29.110 --> 01:26:30.670]
Joel Feinberg's segment on QAM.

[01:26:31.210 --> 01:26:32.730]
Just get your own live sponsor, baby.

[01:26:33.210 --> 01:26:33.950]
It should be no problem.

[01:26:34.450 --> 01:26:36.230]
I forgot about the check on this thing.

[01:26:36.370 --> 01:26:36.830]
How many we got left?

[01:26:37.030 --> 01:26:38.690]
35 on the river house.

[01:26:39.370 --> 01:26:41.650]
It opened up at noon and I wasn't plugging in 30.

[01:26:42.310 --> 01:26:42.990]
We got 30.

[01:26:43.630 --> 01:26:44.350]
How many we got left?

[01:26:44.550 --> 01:26:45.530]
About 30, man.

[01:26:45.730 --> 01:26:46.070]
I'll be there.

[01:26:46.370 --> 01:26:47.110]
He texted you.

[01:26:47.230 --> 01:26:47.530]
That's right.

[01:26:47.670 --> 01:26:48.710]
He's got your text.

[01:26:49.030 --> 01:26:49.710]
You're a phone.

[01:26:49.750 --> 01:26:50.330]
Got it from Zach.

[01:26:52.290 --> 01:26:53.570]
Is it what Zach told you?

[01:26:53.570 --> 01:26:54.530]
No, no, I'm just presenting.

[01:26:54.530 --> 01:26:55.130]
Why is your backpack?

[01:26:56.350 --> 01:26:57.930]
You don't have to know what you're having.

[01:26:57.930 --> 01:26:58.830]
You know, have a backpack.

[01:26:58.950 --> 01:26:59.790]
Who there, Joel?

[01:26:59.950 --> 01:27:01.810]
You got Joel and you know, mold coming together.

[01:27:01.930 --> 01:27:03.890]
Maybe you can pair them up in the morning with Sid the Abnox.

[01:27:03.950 --> 01:27:06.210]
We got how many left?

[01:27:06.570 --> 01:27:08.250]
30 out of 100 for a river house.

[01:27:09.070 --> 01:27:11.630]
See, ours doesn't take like two weeks, three weeks to start a lot of life.

[01:27:11.950 --> 01:27:13.590]
That's because you don't really have anybody listening.

[01:27:14.050 --> 01:27:15.810]
I think they get a lot of wired diaries over there.

[01:27:15.890 --> 01:27:16.190]
But whatever.

[01:27:16.590 --> 01:27:16.810]
27.

[01:27:18.150 --> 01:27:19.790]
Like I said, we got 27 left.

[01:27:20.530 --> 01:27:23.990]
And the reason this has taken a little bit longer is because I've been thinking.

[01:27:24.370 --> 01:27:25.890]
Because they got a two-step process on it.

[01:27:25.990 --> 01:27:26.910]
They got to do the two-step.

[01:27:27.270 --> 01:27:27.990]
Two-step drop.

[01:27:29.810 --> 01:27:31.030]
Thoughts of 100 instead of 50.

[01:27:32.210 --> 01:27:34.950]
Now, I know that we had 100 last week and we sold them out in one minute.

[01:27:35.870 --> 01:27:36.450]
One minute.

[01:27:37.290 --> 01:27:40.150]
That's back when we had an audience before Joel Feinberg chased him all the way.

[01:27:40.450 --> 01:27:44.250]
Okay, what I'm thinking is I'll challenge Joel Feinberg since he thinks I'm such an A-hole.

[01:27:44.650 --> 01:27:47.050]
Why doesn't he come on the air one day this day?

[01:27:47.150 --> 01:27:48.010]
No, I'm Monday.

[01:27:48.010 --> 01:27:49.950]
Sure, because this is the last day for me this week.

[01:27:50.250 --> 01:27:51.650]
We won't let him call twice in one day.

[01:27:52.710 --> 01:27:53.590]
Nobody gets to do that.

[01:27:53.810 --> 01:27:54.390]
No, that's right.

[01:27:54.430 --> 01:27:54.970]
Not even Joel.

[01:27:55.350 --> 01:27:57.610]
And we can negotiate a deal right here on the air.

[01:27:58.370 --> 01:27:58.790]
It'll be great.

[01:27:58.890 --> 01:27:59.870]
Is that the first time for that?

[01:28:00.390 --> 01:28:01.450]
Yeah, I don't think that's ever happened before.

[01:28:01.450 --> 01:28:02.090]
We're all casting.

[01:28:02.370 --> 01:28:06.990]
And they can't do a contract tempering thing because they've already violated my contract in so many different ways

[01:28:06.990 --> 01:28:08.350]
that we can't even count it.

[01:28:08.790 --> 01:28:11.050]
Not that I would work for him, you understand, but I think it would be fun.

[01:28:11.710 --> 01:28:13.490]
Let's negotiate a deal right on the air, Joel.

[01:28:13.610 --> 01:28:14.550]
Come on, there's the challenge.

[01:28:15.190 --> 01:28:17.030]
He wants me so bad he can taste it.

[01:28:17.390 --> 01:28:19.170]
He can taste the old pickle in the barrel.

[01:28:20.270 --> 01:28:23.590]
17 left is all we got on our other ribber house in Fort Lauderdale, good food.

[01:28:23.950 --> 01:28:24.810]
And what do you guys eat now?

[01:28:24.990 --> 01:28:25.670]
You can know that dessert.

[01:28:25.790 --> 01:28:28.750]
I don't know what chocolate cheesecake and that chocolate moose pyramid.

[01:28:29.830 --> 01:28:30.650]
Oh, that's right.

[01:28:30.770 --> 01:28:32.510]
You said the deeper you get in there, the darker it gets.

[01:28:33.890 --> 01:28:35.150]
I see the chocolate too.

[01:28:35.550 --> 01:28:35.810]
You're right.

[01:28:36.610 --> 01:28:37.970]
14 left is all we got.

[01:28:38.110 --> 01:28:40.490]
But these things are going like hotcakes if I dare say that.

[01:28:41.510 --> 01:28:44.110]
And I'm sure Duff is really all looked up about that.

[01:28:44.110 --> 01:28:46.770]
Here's Jonathan Plantation, one of our regular factors.

[01:28:46.910 --> 01:28:49.950]
It's good to see some of these people coming back now that the summertime is over.

[01:28:50.250 --> 01:28:51.330]
Now the George chased him all the way.

[01:28:51.670 --> 01:28:56.050]
I say that every year and then you're going to win a real good number in the summertime

[01:28:56.050 --> 01:28:57.910]
and spite of what you're surrounded by.

[01:28:57.990 --> 01:28:58.330]
I'm not worried.

[01:28:59.370 --> 01:29:00.270]
What do you mean by that?

[01:29:00.650 --> 01:29:01.090]
About the number.

[01:29:01.170 --> 01:29:03.730]
I don't want to miss out on a bonus money because you...

[01:29:03.730 --> 01:29:05.270]
Like I do, I can't afford to miss out on that.

[01:29:05.550 --> 01:29:06.590]
Well, we did last time.

[01:29:06.850 --> 01:29:07.770]
I think that's third.

[01:29:08.290 --> 01:29:08.410]
Yeah.

[01:29:08.630 --> 01:29:11.170]
Third and nothing to know the book before it.

[01:29:11.450 --> 01:29:12.530]
Oh my God.

[01:29:12.530 --> 01:29:14.490]
And that's Jolly Joe Beligan, you know.

[01:29:15.370 --> 01:29:19.570]
I think Joe Below had to be a praise of the fact that the Joel Feinti...

[01:29:19.570 --> 01:29:21.650]
So it obviously was him because he's got your number there.

[01:29:22.070 --> 01:29:24.010]
I didn't recognize the voice because he sounds...

[01:29:24.010 --> 01:29:25.590]
He sounds like a nerd.

[01:29:25.810 --> 01:29:26.250]
You know what I was saying?

[01:29:26.590 --> 01:29:28.190]
She came in and said, oh my God.

[01:29:28.610 --> 01:29:29.310]
Do you know that was him?

[01:29:29.450 --> 01:29:29.550]
Yeah.

[01:29:31.630 --> 01:29:33.670]
That has to be unprecedented.

[01:29:34.310 --> 01:29:36.230]
I mean, maybe not, but I mean close to it.

[01:29:36.690 --> 01:29:41.270]
The general manager of the competition across history, calling on his show,

[01:29:41.270 --> 01:29:43.890]
admitting that he loves this show, which he's listening to right now.

[01:29:43.990 --> 01:29:44.790]
I glued the...

[01:29:44.790 --> 01:29:46.770]
Glue to the radio with like a crazy glue.

[01:29:48.170 --> 01:29:48.490]
Obsessed.

[01:29:49.830 --> 01:29:52.670]
And he's given a song to dance like I'm going to meet him at a restaurant here in Toronto,

[01:29:52.670 --> 01:29:53.590]
where we were almost...

[01:29:53.590 --> 01:29:56.430]
We almost did have that meeting and it's a damn good thing for him that we didn't.

[01:29:56.890 --> 01:29:57.050]
11.

[01:29:57.930 --> 01:29:59.110]
We got 11 and another go.

[01:30:00.290 --> 01:30:02.070]
Because talking to one of the phone was bad enough.

[01:30:02.250 --> 01:30:03.230]
But meeting him in person...

[01:30:03.230 --> 01:30:04.390]
I mean, I don't know what the guy looks like.

[01:30:05.310 --> 01:30:07.430]
Not that I look like anything, but then again, that's...

[01:30:07.430 --> 01:30:09.010]
You will remember I sent you a magazine with mine.

[01:30:11.610 --> 01:30:12.730]
I don't want to be...

[01:30:12.730 --> 01:30:13.190]
I can't wait.

[01:30:14.050 --> 01:30:14.730]
I can't wait.

[01:30:14.910 --> 01:30:16.230]
It's the Joel Feinberg show.

[01:30:16.350 --> 01:30:18.010]
Here's Joel to do a live spot for...

[01:30:18.890 --> 01:30:19.650]
...somebody, anybody.

[01:30:20.230 --> 01:30:21.330]
Just open up the yellow pages.

[01:30:22.270 --> 01:30:25.210]
Jonathan says you are absolutely completely correct about zeitgeist.

[01:30:25.310 --> 01:30:28.090]
Talk about an amazing movie and I must see for anyone with a brain.

[01:30:28.550 --> 01:30:30.210]
So obviously it says South Florida is out.

[01:30:31.230 --> 01:30:33.770]
By the way, the movie is available on DVD for $7 a piece.

[01:30:33.970 --> 01:30:35.590]
I bought two copies to give his Christmas gift.

[01:30:35.810 --> 01:30:37.710]
Jonathan says, thanks for letting us know about it.

[01:30:37.710 --> 01:30:38.830]
George, you rock as usual.

[01:30:39.090 --> 01:30:39.610]
Have a great one.

[01:30:39.710 --> 01:30:40.130]
How do you like that?

[01:30:40.190 --> 01:30:40.650]
You rock, George.

[01:30:40.890 --> 01:30:42.130]
George is going to spin some wax.

[01:30:42.610 --> 01:30:42.930]
Right.

[01:30:43.770 --> 01:30:45.750]
He's going to the House of Wax with Vincent Price.

[01:30:45.930 --> 01:30:47.050]
I'm rocking this moose right now.

[01:30:47.890 --> 01:30:48.790]
So what did he say?

[01:30:49.010 --> 01:30:51.450]
He just sent you a thing saying, Neil's in A hole and that was it?

[01:30:52.770 --> 01:30:54.730]
Yeah, that was the last half.

[01:30:54.890 --> 01:30:54.990]
Yeah.

[01:30:55.650 --> 01:30:56.850]
What do you mean the last one?

[01:30:57.150 --> 01:31:00.810]
He said, that wasn't nice and then another one saying that you were in a hole.

[01:31:01.330 --> 01:31:02.350]
What was it nice?

[01:31:02.530 --> 01:31:03.130]
What does that mean?

[01:31:03.430 --> 01:31:04.530]
He weren't nice to him on the air.

[01:31:04.690 --> 01:31:05.230]
Of course not.

[01:31:05.290 --> 01:31:06.190]
Why should I be nice to him?

[01:31:06.190 --> 01:31:07.030]
He's the general manager.

[01:31:07.630 --> 01:31:09.170]
They would do anything to hurt us.

[01:31:09.310 --> 01:31:10.490]
They would do anything to hurt us.

[01:31:10.930 --> 01:31:12.050]
Don't you remember those days?

[01:31:12.330 --> 01:31:13.650]
They would do anything to hurt us.

[01:31:13.790 --> 01:31:15.910]
Like a world child with daddy's money, you know?

[01:31:16.370 --> 01:31:18.050]
They would do anything to hurt us.

[01:31:18.830 --> 01:31:20.090]
You don't have to worry, Joe.

[01:31:20.190 --> 01:31:20.850]
We'll hurt ourselves.

[01:31:21.250 --> 01:31:22.270]
Okay, we're killing ourselves.

[01:31:23.350 --> 01:31:25.690]
We'll commit in hairy care every day without the cubs.

[01:31:28.630 --> 01:31:29.670]
Oh my God.

[01:31:30.810 --> 01:31:32.270]
They would do anything to hurt us.

[01:31:33.930 --> 01:31:38.330]
And then of course his rant about the Wayne and the dolphins, you know, when they give us the games,

[01:31:38.330 --> 01:31:39.610]
which they give us nothing about a headache.

[01:31:40.170 --> 01:31:43.910]
And, you know, oh, gee, they don't care about our business.

[01:31:44.430 --> 01:31:45.910]
Quit being a spoiled little rich kid.

[01:31:45.990 --> 01:31:48.430]
Okay, Joe, if you want to send me some money, I'll be glad to take it.

[01:31:48.910 --> 01:31:51.510]
In fact, I got an even better offer for Joel Feinberg right now.

[01:31:51.950 --> 01:31:56.130]
Forget about my workin over there, because I don't want to get back with Mo again and Goldie and then...

[01:31:56.130 --> 01:31:56.550]
Oh, come on down.

[01:31:57.230 --> 01:31:58.050]
...and would sit the kid.

[01:31:58.250 --> 01:31:59.910]
I don't want to get involved with those people over there.

[01:31:59.910 --> 01:32:04.490]
But, I'm thinking if he just buys out my contract, I'll just walk away right now.

[01:32:04.670 --> 01:32:05.750]
Like that, what do we got that thing?

[01:32:05.910 --> 01:32:06.770]
It's just walk away.

[01:32:06.990 --> 01:32:07.530]
That's the one.

[01:32:08.270 --> 01:32:08.770]
Very good.

[01:32:09.830 --> 01:32:10.910]
I'll walk away right now.

[01:32:10.970 --> 01:32:11.890]
I won't even come back on Monday.

[01:32:13.630 --> 01:32:15.910]
All he's got to do is pick up the tab for the rest of it.

[01:32:16.810 --> 01:32:18.070]
Don't you think that's possibly?

[01:32:19.230 --> 01:32:19.450]
Sure.

[01:32:19.650 --> 01:32:20.250]
You can only go...

[01:32:20.250 --> 01:32:21.070]
When you do it on the air...

[01:32:21.070 --> 01:32:21.270]
When you do it on the air...

[01:32:21.270 --> 01:32:21.410]
When you do it on the air...

[01:32:21.410 --> 01:32:23.370]
We have 100 and now there are four.

[01:32:23.630 --> 01:32:24.110]
Four left.

[01:32:24.850 --> 01:32:27.470]
So you want them for the river house, you better grab them right now.

[01:32:28.130 --> 01:32:30.470]
Four fifty dollars certificates for twenty five bucks.

[01:32:30.810 --> 01:32:31.870]
They'll be gone in a few minutes.

[01:32:32.130 --> 01:32:34.050]
You keep your eye on a Chris that'll keep you off the street.

[01:32:34.270 --> 01:32:34.430]
Okay.

[01:32:34.510 --> 01:32:34.990]
They'll be holding a do.

[01:32:35.530 --> 01:32:37.190]
And maybe Joel Feinberg will call back.

[01:32:37.510 --> 01:32:40.110]
He calls in on the airline no less.

[01:32:40.490 --> 01:32:41.630]
And I'm supposed to know what's really him.

[01:32:42.930 --> 01:32:45.090]
Well, what's your take on that whole thing?

[01:32:45.850 --> 01:32:47.190]
Obviously he wasn't listening to his own station.

[01:32:47.950 --> 01:32:50.550]
Well, you know, obviously he listened to the show religiously every day

[01:32:50.550 --> 01:32:52.550]
and wants to be desperately over there, which isn't going to happen.

[01:32:52.890 --> 01:32:53.610]
What's your take, George?

[01:32:53.810 --> 01:32:57.270]
He wants to know what time on Monday you'd like to negotiate your new contract on the air.

[01:32:57.270 --> 01:32:58.870]
Did he respond again?

[01:32:59.610 --> 01:33:00.290]
What time on Monday?

[01:33:00.430 --> 01:33:01.550]
That's the text I got just then.

[01:33:01.650 --> 01:33:01.930]
Yeah.

[01:33:03.790 --> 01:33:04.790]
Okay, I'll tell you what.

[01:33:05.090 --> 01:33:05.750]
Here's the deal.

[01:33:06.110 --> 01:33:07.810]
Send him back the bat line.

[01:33:08.550 --> 01:33:08.850]
Okay.

[01:33:09.470 --> 01:33:09.830]
Yeah.

[01:33:10.190 --> 01:33:13.270]
And tell him right at the beginning we can promote this all weekend long.

[01:33:14.610 --> 01:33:15.750]
Not going to anybody will.

[01:33:16.290 --> 01:33:20.810]
And at ten oh five on Monday morning he can call in and be my first caller on a bat line.

[01:33:21.050 --> 01:33:22.510]
I want to negotiate our contract on the air.

[01:33:22.590 --> 01:33:22.770]
I'll say.

[01:33:23.190 --> 01:33:23.690]
All right.

[01:33:24.250 --> 01:33:26.370]
When they said there's no business like show business, they worked there.

[01:33:26.370 --> 01:33:27.670]
There's no business like.

[01:33:27.850 --> 01:33:28.710]
Well, it was my idea.

[01:33:28.850 --> 01:33:29.830]
I think it's a great idea.

[01:33:31.010 --> 01:33:34.510]
Now maybe he wants to buy me out or maybe he actually would like me to have me on the air

[01:33:34.510 --> 01:33:36.810]
over there and really kick ass and promote the show.

[01:33:36.950 --> 01:33:37.510]
What do you think, George?

[01:33:39.110 --> 01:33:41.930]
George would go wherever you go.

[01:33:42.110 --> 01:33:45.370]
Because if they have a sense of humor over there they don't, you know, they're not in this pure,

[01:33:45.450 --> 01:33:46.390]
they're all attached to your hip.

[01:33:46.550 --> 01:33:47.430]
I'll go where you go, baby.

[01:33:48.050 --> 01:33:48.690]
That's where you're attached.

[01:33:49.270 --> 01:33:50.050]
Yes, at the hips.

[01:33:50.150 --> 01:33:50.870]
That's where he craves to.

[01:33:50.970 --> 01:33:51.690]
I said, hip to the cop.

[01:33:52.930 --> 01:33:55.490]
We're attached to the toe.

[01:33:56.350 --> 01:33:58.090]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[01:33:58.910 --> 01:34:01.290]
So you're getting pretty tight with your old fiber with these.

[01:34:01.390 --> 01:34:02.270]
Apparently we're telling you.

[01:34:02.270 --> 01:34:03.010]
That's what he's just back in the world.

[01:34:03.390 --> 01:34:03.670]
Wow.

[01:34:04.970 --> 01:34:05.970]
And there's not a call.

[01:34:06.170 --> 01:34:07.110]
That's not the more thanks to all.

[01:34:07.190 --> 01:34:08.530]
We were smoking air for a little while.

[01:34:10.050 --> 01:34:12.370]
You know, wouldn't you think this would provoke some tremendous controversy?

[01:34:12.690 --> 01:34:14.470]
I mean, in this audience, this is the big thing.

[01:34:14.590 --> 01:34:18.970]
The biggest story on our website, the last three or four weeks, was the one that Barry Jack asked

[01:34:18.970 --> 01:34:23.210]
wrote about the South Florida radio wars between us and those lunatics across the street.

[01:34:24.510 --> 01:34:25.970]
That's the most reads of anything.

[01:34:28.350 --> 01:34:29.470]
W-DQ-Y-M, hello.

[01:34:30.050 --> 01:34:30.870]
Hey, Neil, hey.

[01:34:31.310 --> 01:34:34.390]
I'm sure that guy is a douche in a half to work for, but if there's no joy,

[01:34:34.510 --> 01:34:35.870]
it can't be that bad going over.

[01:34:36.230 --> 01:34:38.430]
Maybe he'd actually let me do the show, you think?

[01:34:38.910 --> 01:34:39.550]
That's what I'm saying.

[01:34:40.150 --> 01:34:40.970]
I'd back in on that one.

[01:34:41.450 --> 01:34:41.710]
Okay.

[01:34:42.250 --> 01:34:44.510]
All right, including, I'm bending it like back home.

[01:34:47.710 --> 01:34:48.710]
Yeah, bend the...

[01:34:48.710 --> 01:34:49.050]
Back home.

[01:34:49.810 --> 01:34:50.750]
5, 6, 7, 0.

[01:34:50.750 --> 01:34:52.030]
Well, what is the big deal with him anyway?

[01:34:52.130 --> 01:34:54.770]
He's a soccer player and he don't even look that good anymore, David Beckham.

[01:34:54.830 --> 01:34:55.730]
What's the big deal with him?

[01:34:56.110 --> 01:34:56.970]
Chris, I don't know.

[01:34:56.970 --> 01:34:57.510]
I have no idea.

[01:34:58.550 --> 01:34:59.590]
817 votes on the pool.

[01:34:59.690 --> 01:35:01.390]
I'll give you the result one of these times when we get a chance.

[01:35:01.570 --> 01:35:02.230]
But I think I've just...

[01:35:02.230 --> 01:35:03.130]
I think we have to jackpot.

[01:35:03.530 --> 01:35:03.890]
That's it.

[01:35:04.350 --> 01:35:07.030]
What do you think the guys across the street are thinking about this?

[01:35:07.830 --> 01:35:08.410]
What guy learned?

[01:35:08.470 --> 01:35:12.270]
What do you think that George Sedano, the kid they put on a midday, who's also a big fan of the show?

[01:35:12.630 --> 01:35:17.210]
What do you think that he's thinking that his boss, that his general manager, is calling me on the year while he's on,

[01:35:17.210 --> 01:35:20.970]
and is going to negotiate on Monday a deal for me to go across the street.

[01:35:21.710 --> 01:35:22.290]
Why me?

[01:35:23.870 --> 01:35:25.390]
Now, where does this leave you?

[01:35:25.590 --> 01:35:26.890]
Well, you got Zach and Joe Rosner.

[01:35:27.050 --> 01:35:27.690]
You can work with him.

[01:35:28.070 --> 01:35:28.670]
By the way.

[01:35:29.050 --> 01:35:29.270]
Yes.

[01:35:29.670 --> 01:35:30.190]
Joe says.

[01:35:30.410 --> 01:35:31.010]
Joel says.

[01:35:32.270 --> 01:35:37.010]
You know, my buddy, that he told Mo that he couldn't pay him for airtime.

[01:35:38.090 --> 01:35:39.690]
So whatever you're hearing about Mo going over there.

[01:35:39.690 --> 01:35:40.510]
Yeah, I knew that.

[01:35:40.630 --> 01:35:41.730]
And did I say that?

[01:35:41.970 --> 01:35:44.730]
Which means he'll probably be on my close personal friend, Joel Feinberg.

[01:35:44.730 --> 01:35:48.570]
Maybe stupid at times, but nobody in the world, including him, is dumb enough to put Mo on here.

[01:35:48.570 --> 01:35:49.310]
Do-do-do-do-do.

[01:35:49.330 --> 01:35:53.390]
Okay. I mean, one obnoxious New Yorker by himself is bad enough, but two side by each.

[01:35:53.530 --> 01:35:54.450]
Come on now, man.

[01:35:55.210 --> 01:35:55.530]
Wow.

[01:35:56.350 --> 01:35:59.310]
So in other words, Mo couldn't pay him enough money to be on the year over there.

[01:35:59.450 --> 01:36:03.650]
And Hank, he said he wouldn't touch it with a 800-pound pool.

[01:36:03.750 --> 01:36:04.630]
I mean, with an 80-foot pool.

[01:36:04.730 --> 01:36:04.910]
Oh, sorry.

[01:36:06.270 --> 01:36:07.710]
Maybe he can pay Hank by the pound.

[01:36:08.590 --> 01:36:09.530]
W-D-Q-A-M, hello.

[01:36:11.650 --> 01:36:12.390]
Q-A-M.

[01:36:12.870 --> 01:36:13.190]
Q-A-M.

[01:36:15.150 --> 01:36:16.070]
You can do it, man.

[01:36:16.170 --> 01:36:16.870]
I guess he couldn't do it.

[01:36:16.930 --> 01:36:17.690]
I-here I thought he could.

[01:36:17.810 --> 01:36:18.530]
Q-A-M, not there.

[01:36:18.910 --> 01:36:19.530]
Q-A-M, hello.

[01:36:21.930 --> 01:36:22.210]
Hola.

[01:36:24.990 --> 01:36:25.390]
Now, what?

[01:36:25.450 --> 01:36:25.990]
No, what just happened?

[01:36:26.130 --> 01:36:27.550]
I think Joel put a hex on us.

[01:36:27.950 --> 01:36:29.350]
He's pretending to be your buddy, you know.

[01:36:30.170 --> 01:36:31.050]
This is evil, Joel.

[01:36:31.130 --> 01:36:32.510]
I knew he would do anything to hurt us.

[01:36:32.690 --> 01:36:33.530]
Well, we are sold out, so.

[01:36:34.550 --> 01:36:35.310]
What do you mean by that?

[01:36:35.550 --> 01:36:36.310]
Yeah, the show is here.

[01:36:36.510 --> 01:36:37.470]
We had a lot of spots, Joel.

[01:36:37.610 --> 01:36:38.290]
Okay, eat your heart out.

[01:36:38.350 --> 01:36:39.430]
We have no listeners anymore.

[01:36:39.630 --> 01:36:40.210]
We have no numbers.

[01:36:40.570 --> 01:36:41.790]
But we got a lot of spots.

[01:36:43.030 --> 01:36:44.210]
We have no scores for your race.

[01:36:44.210 --> 01:36:45.090]
Way too many of them.

[01:36:45.090 --> 01:36:45.090]

[01:36:45.490 --> 01:36:47.550]
You have no numbers.

[01:36:47.550 --> 01:36:49.170]
I never have too many spots to miss my room.

[01:36:49.670 --> 01:36:50.450]
I'm Mark Morgan.

[01:36:50.810 --> 01:36:53.790]
Now here's Neil Rogers on 560 Q-A-M.

[01:36:54.990 --> 01:36:55.670]
Break down, shout.

[01:36:56.290 --> 01:36:59.530]
Where the mother once goes to Hank from trees.

[01:36:59.910 --> 01:37:03.710]
And Clay Van Jones, you've got some who own a station.

[01:37:04.030 --> 01:37:05.790]
All new Frank won't grade.

[01:37:06.270 --> 01:37:07.410]
We got one certificate, like.

[01:37:07.430 --> 01:37:08.430]
Now I've no words.

[01:37:08.430 --> 01:37:13.390]
Caroline goes, rallies a big city, you know.

[01:37:13.690 --> 01:37:16.630]
And that's where the beeswiss had to go.

[01:37:17.010 --> 01:37:18.870]
For Golly, Riley Jones.

[01:37:19.250 --> 01:37:19.530]
Oh!

[01:37:20.630 --> 01:37:21.430]
A new GM.

[01:37:23.750 --> 01:37:25.370]
He'll do what he can.

[01:37:26.830 --> 01:37:28.650]
Shake your hand like a friend.

[01:37:29.370 --> 01:37:31.350]
Then quickly walk away.

[01:37:32.010 --> 01:37:36.450]
And he had Jones go to 560 with ratings

[01:37:36.450 --> 01:37:39.410]
and the toilet bowl to get those.

[01:37:39.790 --> 01:37:43.810]
Plaming sportful mose in order and control.

[01:37:44.850 --> 01:37:49.250]
And then so Golly, Riley, Joe of a humor

[01:37:49.250 --> 01:37:52.570]
and in the note he lets mose go.

[01:37:52.950 --> 01:37:56.490]
And here's what blows his Golly his own show.

[01:37:56.630 --> 01:37:57.170]
Oh!

[01:37:57.650 --> 01:37:59.790]
He'll make a big change.

[01:38:01.050 --> 01:38:02.810]
And read a range.

[01:38:03.930 --> 01:38:05.850]
It's worse for the same.

[01:38:06.630 --> 01:38:08.850]
He hasn't done a thing.

[01:38:09.790 --> 01:38:12.910]
Or what goes on the air at two.

[01:38:13.350 --> 01:38:15.750]
Joe don't have a stinkin' clue.

[01:38:16.090 --> 01:38:16.830]
Out of four.

[01:38:17.370 --> 01:38:20.990]
Not that essentially blows for all radio.

[01:38:21.530 --> 01:38:21.750]
Oh!

[01:38:22.190 --> 01:38:25.050]
The GM of 560.

[01:38:25.910 --> 01:38:27.410]
Golly, Riley, Joe.

[01:38:28.310 --> 01:38:29.790]
1217 and 560.

[01:38:29.890 --> 01:38:30.830]
That's what we got.

[01:38:30.830 --> 01:38:32.730]
Top head Greg Reid, look what we got now.

[01:38:33.050 --> 01:38:34.250]
829 votes on the pool.

[01:38:34.510 --> 01:38:37.490]
Who is your least favorite, the Part 2 QAM host?

[01:38:38.450 --> 01:38:39.590]
Mohawar Davida did it.

[01:38:39.730 --> 01:38:41.730]
Who Joe 5er says he wouldn't touch with your money.

[01:38:42.450 --> 01:38:43.210]
228 vote.

[01:38:44.010 --> 01:38:45.470]
All of the above 193.

[01:38:46.590 --> 01:38:48.330]
Scott Farrell, 101.

[01:38:49.530 --> 01:38:50.410]
Golly, 92.

[01:38:51.050 --> 01:38:52.570]
Pretty high on the Ricker's Fearll air Golly.

[01:38:53.130 --> 01:38:54.110]
The Crow of 66.

[01:38:54.390 --> 01:38:55.190]
Kenny Walker, 90.

[01:38:55.510 --> 01:38:55.790]
Or 50.

[01:38:55.930 --> 01:38:56.530]
I'm sorry, 50.

[01:38:58.150 --> 01:38:59.910]
V433, Mark Eisenberg 25.

[01:39:00.190 --> 01:39:01.110]
Ron Hersey, 21.

[01:39:01.770 --> 01:39:03.210]
And Joe Castello, only 20.

[01:39:03.330 --> 01:39:04.270]
They love Joe Castello.

[01:39:05.130 --> 01:39:05.570]
What's that?

[01:39:05.870 --> 01:39:07.370]
Why did he...

[01:39:07.370 --> 01:39:07.910]
I can't hear him.

[01:39:08.670 --> 01:39:10.110]
Oh, you don't remember that story?

[01:39:10.350 --> 01:39:12.130]
Yeah, something about pornography in the middle of the night.

[01:39:12.290 --> 01:39:12.970]
I had an overnight show.

[01:39:13.150 --> 01:39:13.390]
I forget.

[01:39:13.390 --> 01:39:14.010]
I had to do it with that.

[01:39:15.250 --> 01:39:16.070]
And I do it with something like that.

[01:39:16.430 --> 01:39:17.030]
831 vote.

[01:39:17.310 --> 01:39:19.330]
We'll make that thousand if it's the last thing we do, Chris.

[01:39:19.490 --> 01:39:22.270]
Now, if we do go across the street, do we take Chris with us or what?

[01:39:22.510 --> 01:39:22.690]
Yeah.

[01:39:23.170 --> 01:39:23.730]
Well, it's pentatonic.

[01:39:23.950 --> 01:39:25.230]
I think part of it.

[01:39:25.230 --> 01:39:26.050]
Or what do you mean by that?

[01:39:26.170 --> 01:39:27.230]
Could they pay any less?

[01:39:27.550 --> 01:39:27.990]
That's true.

[01:39:28.550 --> 01:39:29.630]
Could they pay any less?

[01:39:29.810 --> 01:39:34.450]
Like I told Miguel when he called me, I was at Woodbuy and there, or leave in there a couple

[01:39:34.450 --> 01:39:35.730]
weeks ago, whenever it was.

[01:39:36.010 --> 01:39:38.970]
And I told him, and one thing, you know, at least they're going to treat you better over there.

[01:39:39.030 --> 01:39:39.870]
They couldn't treat you any worse.

[01:39:41.050 --> 01:39:42.030]
And he said, amen to that.

[01:39:42.210 --> 01:39:43.670]
Or something in Spanish I didn't understand.

[01:39:45.090 --> 01:39:46.210]
It sounded like...

[01:39:46.210 --> 01:39:47.690]
Rick Shaw.

[01:39:48.470 --> 01:39:48.950]
Like that.

[01:39:50.130 --> 01:39:50.970]
So what do you think, George?

[01:39:51.050 --> 01:39:52.010]
We're ready to pack up and go.

[01:39:52.550 --> 01:39:53.270]
Hey, whatever, man.

[01:39:53.850 --> 01:39:56.790]
Let's see if the audience would follow us across the street to 790.

[01:39:56.950 --> 01:39:57.890]
I think I think I'd better signal.

[01:39:58.070 --> 01:39:59.330]
I know they got a better spot on the dining room.

[01:39:59.330 --> 01:40:01.450]
If you tell them you can play a fart sound, they'll all come over.

[01:40:01.750 --> 01:40:03.070]
Yeah, that's going to be the first...

[01:40:03.070 --> 01:40:08.910]
Okay, list of questions for Joel Feinberg when we have our big call on Monday morning at 10.05.

[01:40:09.190 --> 01:40:10.890]
We want our farts, we want our words back.

[01:40:12.150 --> 01:40:13.650]
We want our words back like...

[01:40:13.650 --> 01:40:16.670]
You know, the English language like D, bag, and A whole...

[01:40:16.670 --> 01:40:17.710]
And D-Bas, bag.

[01:40:17.950 --> 01:40:18.390]
And what about S-Bag?

[01:40:18.470 --> 01:40:20.570]
You know, the English language would like to be able to speak English.

[01:40:21.090 --> 01:40:21.450]
Really?

[01:40:22.170 --> 01:40:25.350]
In other words, we'd like to obey FCC rules, but not a whole bunch of rules of joy.

[01:40:25.430 --> 01:40:27.450]
But not made up arbitrary people...

[01:40:28.030 --> 01:40:28.670]
In composing people...

[01:40:28.670 --> 01:40:28.970]
You see, aren't they...

[01:40:28.970 --> 01:40:29.970]
Are people fakers on a power trip?

[01:40:30.170 --> 01:40:30.730]
Are rules yes?

[01:40:31.330 --> 01:40:33.390]
I have a feeling that if we went over there across the street,

[01:40:33.530 --> 01:40:36.970]
even with Joe Rose coming back with the Kevin McKeop Jackson or whatever his name is in the morning,

[01:40:37.210 --> 01:40:39.430]
I think that would be the anneal and the coffin for these people.

[01:40:40.110 --> 01:40:43.590]
And well deserved fat ass, jolly, Joe, and the clearance and joy.

[01:40:45.370 --> 01:40:46.270]
Somebody QYM, hello?

[01:40:47.310 --> 01:40:47.850]
Hey, Neil.

[01:40:48.310 --> 01:40:48.650]
Yes, sir.

[01:40:48.750 --> 01:40:49.070]
Good afternoon.

[01:40:49.190 --> 01:40:49.670]
How are you doing today?

[01:40:49.670 --> 01:40:50.150]
Okay.

[01:40:50.490 --> 01:40:53.970]
I was just driving back from Gulf Stream, and I had you on the radio.

[01:40:54.830 --> 01:40:57.270]
And I heard you'd lane into yet another call.

[01:40:57.870 --> 01:40:59.830]
You've got a lot of angry old people here.

[01:40:59.970 --> 01:41:00.890]
What's going on?

[01:41:01.210 --> 01:41:02.250]
No, I'm not angry at all.

[01:41:02.470 --> 01:41:02.650]
Did I?

[01:41:03.130 --> 01:41:03.370]
No.

[01:41:03.690 --> 01:41:04.990]
Yeah, if your life is great.

[01:41:05.150 --> 01:41:06.650]
I mean, if it makes you happy, do you think that you're...

[01:41:06.650 --> 01:41:07.590]
No, no, no, no.

[01:41:07.810 --> 01:41:09.050]
I... that's exactly it.

[01:41:09.270 --> 01:41:11.230]
Your life appears to be great.

[01:41:11.330 --> 01:41:12.470]
Everything's good at the station.

[01:41:12.770 --> 01:41:13.230]
I mean, you're...

[01:41:13.230 --> 01:41:14.670]
No, everything is not good at the station.

[01:41:14.770 --> 01:41:16.550]
Well, what makes you say everything is good at the station.

[01:41:16.550 --> 01:41:17.930]
No, well, good at the station, meaning that you're getting your checks.

[01:41:17.930 --> 01:41:19.030]
I'm getting my check.

[01:41:19.150 --> 01:41:21.050]
Well, in other words, that's all life is to you.

[01:41:21.050 --> 01:41:21.670]
It's getting paid.

[01:41:21.970 --> 01:41:23.050]
And then just to pay in.

[01:41:23.110 --> 01:41:23.670]
Well, why is that?

[01:41:23.830 --> 01:41:24.270]
But, you've been saying?

[01:41:24.650 --> 01:41:25.570]
Yes, that's all accounts.

[01:41:25.830 --> 01:41:27.570]
When you're working for these people, that's all accounts.

[01:41:27.770 --> 01:41:28.930]
That's not what life is all about.

[01:41:29.230 --> 01:41:30.990]
That's what life with the beesleases is all about.

[01:41:31.290 --> 01:41:35.210]
It's just making sure you get paid on time, or maybe you're there too early, or sometimes five days early.

[01:41:35.570 --> 01:41:36.930]
Nice going fat ass jolly, Joe.

[01:41:37.070 --> 01:41:39.850]
That's his claim to fame with me, as he gets to the checks there.

[01:41:39.990 --> 01:41:41.330]
Well, you know, there's something to be said for that.

[01:41:42.910 --> 01:41:46.150]
But that's as far as I push it, because I know he's incapable of doing anything else,

[01:41:46.150 --> 01:41:48.270]
like, you know, anything that makes any sense.

[01:41:48.770 --> 01:41:51.090]
Like the fact that his production disc, I still don't have.

[01:41:51.370 --> 01:41:52.390]
Now, is it going to show up today?

[01:41:52.910 --> 01:41:53.370]
So that's what I'm saying.

[01:41:53.370 --> 01:41:55.370]
I asked him, and he said he mailed it that day.

[01:41:55.690 --> 01:41:58.950]
So maybe he got hung up in customs because it's a burst of material.

[01:41:59.310 --> 01:42:00.290]
Get out of here.

[01:42:00.810 --> 01:42:03.090]
Everything is an excuse that comes from that building.

[01:42:03.390 --> 01:42:06.230]
Every other FedEx that I send, if I send it before six o'clock at night,

[01:42:06.550 --> 01:42:09.350]
it's wherever I send it by 10 o'clock the next morning at the latest.

[01:42:09.890 --> 01:42:10.250]
Everything.

[01:42:11.670 --> 01:42:12.950]
Focus this showed up here.

[01:42:13.050 --> 01:42:14.230]
Just find his wine yesterday.

[01:42:14.230 --> 01:42:15.990]
No problem at all, and spread it the holiday on Monday.

[01:42:16.290 --> 01:42:16.790]
No problem.

[01:42:17.530 --> 01:42:18.790]
But it comes from QAIM.

[01:42:18.890 --> 01:42:20.090]
Oh, but I beeped and it opened up.

[01:42:20.350 --> 01:42:21.950]
I mean FedEx, what do you think, Neil?

[01:42:22.050 --> 01:42:23.230]
I mean, you're like in another country.

[01:42:23.470 --> 01:42:24.850]
I mean, how do you do that?

[01:42:25.870 --> 01:42:26.910]
It's like that ad.

[01:42:27.450 --> 01:42:30.730]
Is it a FedEx spot where they got that package seen in it and one guy says,

[01:42:31.010 --> 01:42:34.270]
we're supposed to, we got to make this box go from here to Germany.

[01:42:34.450 --> 01:42:34.970]
How do we do that?

[01:42:35.090 --> 01:42:36.090]
You know the spot I'm talking about?

[01:42:36.250 --> 01:42:36.370]
No.

[01:42:37.130 --> 01:42:37.910]
You've never seen that?

[01:42:37.990 --> 01:42:38.530]
No, great spot.

[01:42:39.510 --> 01:42:40.910]
Oh, that box from here to Germany.

[01:42:40.910 --> 01:42:41.430]
I don't know.

[01:42:41.550 --> 01:42:43.310]
Let's have a meeting about it.

[01:42:43.370 --> 01:42:45.830]
You know, WQA and hello.

[01:42:46.630 --> 01:42:47.510]
Neil, how are you?

[01:42:47.790 --> 01:42:48.890]
Let's break up into groups.

[01:42:49.110 --> 01:42:49.470]
Yes, sir.

[01:42:50.330 --> 01:42:51.950]
Neil, you crossed the street, man.

[01:42:52.070 --> 01:42:52.710]
I'm there with you.

[01:42:52.770 --> 01:42:54.270]
I'm not going to abandon you.

[01:42:54.790 --> 01:42:55.910]
But what do you think about that?

[01:42:55.990 --> 01:42:59.410]
Do you think this is a revolutionary idea that I could negotiate a new deal on the year on Monday?

[01:43:00.010 --> 01:43:00.870]
Hey, find me up.

[01:43:00.950 --> 01:43:02.910]
I'm part of the revolutionary army.

[01:43:03.650 --> 01:43:03.890]
I'll be there.

[01:43:03.890 --> 01:43:04.150]
Okay.

[01:43:04.350 --> 01:43:04.650]
Thank you.

[01:43:04.710 --> 01:43:05.250]
Thank you very much.

[01:43:05.310 --> 01:43:05.870]
I'm going to get a new phone.

[01:43:07.630 --> 01:43:09.850]
Here's a fact that says, oh, look at this.

[01:43:09.850 --> 01:43:10.870]
Callers five and six.

[01:43:11.110 --> 01:43:12.030]
I better look at that.

[01:43:12.110 --> 01:43:12.670]
Do we have any left?

[01:43:12.810 --> 01:43:13.250]
The certificates?

[01:43:13.350 --> 01:43:14.010]
Is there still a one?

[01:43:14.990 --> 01:43:15.710]
Are you still the one?

[01:43:17.890 --> 01:43:19.090]
I still got one on there.

[01:43:19.250 --> 01:43:19.630]
I have zero.

[01:43:19.910 --> 01:43:20.650]
No, I have zero now.

[01:43:21.110 --> 01:43:21.550]
Sold out.

[01:43:22.350 --> 01:43:24.230]
Which means that it's sold out and confirmed.

[01:43:24.410 --> 01:43:24.590]
Correct.

[01:43:24.930 --> 01:43:25.790]
It's a sealed deal.

[01:43:25.990 --> 01:43:26.270]
Okay, good.

[01:43:26.510 --> 01:43:27.150]
It's an earning lift.

[01:43:27.330 --> 01:43:32.130]
But callers five and six right now at 1-800-227-0560.

[01:43:32.130 --> 01:43:34.630]
We're in a $50 certificate to the River House in Fort Lauderdale.

[01:43:34.930 --> 01:43:38.130]
And by the way, you've got those ones to send to our close personal friend that duck told me we're in there.

[01:43:38.310 --> 01:43:38.790]
Already in the mail?

[01:43:39.150 --> 01:43:39.830]
Already in the mail.

[01:43:39.850 --> 01:43:40.730]
How do you like that, Professor?

[01:43:40.730 --> 01:43:41.830]
They're already in the mail.

[01:43:41.830 --> 01:43:43.070]
Am I the best or what?

[01:43:43.190 --> 01:43:43.310]
No.

[01:43:43.510 --> 01:43:44.030]
Yes, I am.

[01:43:44.790 --> 01:43:47.790]
Callers five and six right now at 1-800-227-0560.

[01:43:48.550 --> 01:43:51.350]
We're in a $50 certificate to the River House in Fort Lauderdale.

[01:43:52.150 --> 01:43:54.930]
1-800-227-0560.

[01:43:55.110 --> 01:43:55.230]
Oh!

[01:43:56.450 --> 01:43:57.350]
How's Henry Barrow doing?

[01:43:57.530 --> 01:43:58.370]
Still fat as the house?

[01:43:58.590 --> 01:43:59.170]
Is there a problem with that?

[01:43:59.310 --> 01:43:59.630]
I'm not.

[01:44:00.050 --> 01:44:01.410]
Why do I keep thinking about that?

[01:44:01.490 --> 01:44:01.710]
I don't know.

[01:44:01.850 --> 01:44:01.850]

[01:44:02.910 --> 01:44:03.850]
I'm just going to hit it.

[01:44:03.990 --> 01:44:05.290]
I've got a migraine thinking about that.

[01:44:05.510 --> 01:44:06.810]
It was either that or Joel Feinberg.

[01:44:07.670 --> 01:44:09.330]
Now, I will say this.

[01:44:11.450 --> 01:44:19.210]
I can't say much for him, but when he called on me, now maybe he put on a better show for the audience, you know, because it's on a year, and somebody might actually be listening, but I doubt it.

[01:44:19.870 --> 01:44:25.270]
He sounded much more, I don't know what the word is, like a bench.

[01:44:25.530 --> 01:44:28.710]
Not a bench, but more human than when he talked to me here.

[01:44:29.650 --> 01:44:32.090]
So that inhuman, maybe he was in the bag when he was here.

[01:44:32.170 --> 01:44:34.850]
I don't know what the deal was, but he was just like a puss.

[01:44:35.290 --> 01:44:36.310]
Oh, hi, Neil.

[01:44:36.550 --> 01:44:36.970]
How are you?

[01:44:37.130 --> 01:44:39.850]
You're like a puss, like a nebber, like a schmuck.

[01:44:40.930 --> 01:44:42.110]
W-D-Q-A-M, hello.

[01:44:42.690 --> 01:44:43.790]
Hey, Neil, how you doing today?

[01:44:44.110 --> 01:44:44.370]
Okay.

[01:44:45.030 --> 01:44:45.350]
Great.

[01:44:45.770 --> 01:44:47.110]
Anyway, I was just thinking about this.

[01:44:47.630 --> 01:44:51.830]
Do you enjoy the sort of combat pay for putting up with those morons at the B-Blade group?

[01:44:52.310 --> 01:44:52.530]
Yeah.

[01:44:53.390 --> 01:44:54.430]
That is death met.

[01:44:55.090 --> 01:44:55.370]
Yeah?

[01:44:55.870 --> 01:44:56.930]
Yep, that is death.

[01:44:57.070 --> 01:44:58.770]
The only thing I can say about that is, do you know what I'm saying?

[01:44:58.770 --> 01:44:59.490]
Let me ask you a question.

[01:44:59.630 --> 01:45:00.050]
Is it definite?

[01:45:00.910 --> 01:45:01.670]
I believe so.

[01:45:01.830 --> 01:45:02.850]
Okay, thank you.

[01:45:02.990 --> 01:45:04.150]
Thank you for your student opinion.

[01:45:04.150 --> 01:45:05.610]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[01:45:06.090 --> 01:45:10.290]
You see, the interesting part of it is, I was thinking this before, about an hour ago,

[01:45:10.390 --> 01:45:14.630]
and I got all caught up with the crap, but the fact of the matter is, how many other than

[01:45:14.630 --> 01:45:19.770]
shuffling the deck and reshuffling, how many real new personalities have come into this

[01:45:19.770 --> 01:45:23.290]
market in the last like 10 years, who mean anything, who mean anything.

[01:45:23.550 --> 01:45:25.830]
I'm not just talking about somebody different, who was non-before.

[01:45:26.190 --> 01:45:28.150]
I'm talking about people who mean something.

[01:45:29.430 --> 01:45:30.050]
Do you know what I'm saying?

[01:45:30.550 --> 01:45:30.890]
What do you say?

[01:45:31.490 --> 01:45:34.130]
I'm talking about a big number, more than just in one or two months.

[01:45:34.250 --> 01:45:37.310]
I'm not talking about like Sid the kid, who's screaming in the end because he's got a 25

[01:45:37.310 --> 01:45:40.370]
to 34, because they got a bunch of wired diaries or whatever that was all about.

[01:45:41.090 --> 01:45:42.770]
A bunch of kids, the refugees from New York.

[01:45:44.230 --> 01:45:47.310]
It just doesn't happen, and that's what Rick Shaw and I were talking about last week,

[01:45:47.330 --> 01:45:49.070]
the Sands, they've been this man.

[01:45:50.770 --> 01:45:53.030]
But then again, we got a lot of ex-jocks though on the air.

[01:45:53.170 --> 01:45:53.830]
Oh, yeah.

[01:45:54.090 --> 01:45:57.430]
And we got a lot of sports writers on here, although I noticed that most of them seemed

[01:45:57.430 --> 01:45:59.050]
to have vanished, along with Kenny and Bo.

[01:45:59.050 --> 01:46:01.290]
Maybe they're at the Camilla's house with Kenny and Bo.

[01:46:02.470 --> 01:46:03.210]
WDQA and Hello.

[01:46:06.650 --> 01:46:07.390]
WDQA and Hello.

[01:46:07.930 --> 01:46:08.210]
Neil.

[01:46:08.730 --> 01:46:09.070]
Yes, sir.

[01:46:09.590 --> 01:46:11.870]
What do you think George would go with if you-

[01:46:11.870 --> 01:46:12.930]
WDQA and Hello.

[01:46:13.790 --> 01:46:14.950]
I have a color 5 or 6.

[01:46:17.570 --> 01:46:18.730]
Yes, 5 or 6.

[01:46:20.370 --> 01:46:21.370]
5 and 6.

[01:46:22.770 --> 01:46:25.890]
I guess he just didn't hear the number, or maybe he's stupid, that could be it, or both of

[01:46:25.890 --> 01:46:26.230]
the above.

[01:46:27.610 --> 01:46:28.370]
WDQA and Hello.

[01:46:29.150 --> 01:46:30.010]
I'm con nero.

[01:46:30.170 --> 01:46:30.850]
Yes, sir.

[01:46:31.750 --> 01:46:32.370]
It's one.

[01:46:33.610 --> 01:46:34.630]
Start and get on.

[01:46:34.990 --> 01:46:37.070]
Can I say something to you?

[01:46:37.350 --> 01:46:37.630]
Yeah.

[01:46:37.950 --> 01:46:39.350]
You called here on Tuesday, right?

[01:46:39.850 --> 01:46:40.090]
Yeah.

[01:46:40.630 --> 01:46:42.090]
Why are you calling again today?

[01:46:42.610 --> 01:46:46.330]
You want to become a chronic and really piss me off as that what you want to be.

[01:46:46.550 --> 01:46:47.210]
I'm not a chronic.

[01:46:47.770 --> 01:46:52.150]
If you go across the road, I'll restrict your communication to your faxes, okay, which were

[01:46:52.150 --> 01:46:52.630]
bad enough.

[01:46:53.050 --> 01:46:54.910]
But don't call this show, Stuttering Girl.

[01:46:54.910 --> 01:46:57.690]
I'll give you a date like July 1st of next year.

[01:46:58.710 --> 01:47:02.090]
I'll still be on, although maybe not on this station, you never know, in fact, after Monday.

[01:47:03.250 --> 01:47:04.670]
So what's Joe Beldoin about this?

[01:47:04.770 --> 01:47:06.070]
Is he going to have like a counteroffer?

[01:47:06.190 --> 01:47:08.370]
Is he going to have to be there at 1030 on Monday?

[01:47:08.450 --> 01:47:08.770]
I don't know.

[01:47:10.410 --> 01:47:12.170]
No, in the great sense of humor that he's got.

[01:47:12.810 --> 01:47:16.490]
And by the way, Joe, if you're still listening, which I'm sure you are, Jolly Joe was running

[01:47:16.490 --> 01:47:20.630]
around with some magazine with your picture on it like, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, like that.

[01:47:20.890 --> 01:47:23.070]
I don't see any magazine with Jolly Joe's picture on it, though.

[01:47:23.070 --> 01:47:25.030]
You don't subscribe to that magazine.

[01:47:25.590 --> 01:47:26.250]
What's that?

[01:47:26.750 --> 01:47:27.410]
Losers Inc.

[01:47:29.890 --> 01:47:31.230]
What's their poll?

[01:47:32.650 --> 01:47:33.070]
WQAM.

[01:47:33.730 --> 01:47:34.250]
Oh!

[01:47:36.730 --> 01:47:37.070]
Remember!

[01:47:38.930 --> 01:47:40.810]
It's Golden Gasser!

[01:47:45.150 --> 01:47:46.510]
What's their poll?

[01:47:47.850 --> 01:47:48.810]
WQAM.

[01:47:50.450 --> 01:47:55.390]
Billy, time for your animal on a cheese mom, not another animal.

[01:47:55.770 --> 01:47:58.890]
Kids just hate getting animals, and mom's a giving them.

[01:47:59.310 --> 01:48:01.190]
But now, who's on the pat line?

[01:48:01.630 --> 01:48:06.050]
Love, introducing you in an animal that can be coated chocolate animal that makes getting

[01:48:06.050 --> 01:48:07.010]
cleaned out fun.

[01:48:07.210 --> 01:48:08.750]
Hey, mom, can I have another animal?

[01:48:09.210 --> 01:48:11.550]
I don't know, Billy, that makes your third animal today.

[01:48:11.930 --> 01:48:12.350]
Please!

[01:48:13.430 --> 01:48:14.390]
Well, okay.

[01:48:14.810 --> 01:48:15.010]
Cool.

[01:48:15.350 --> 01:48:17.110]
And this time, I want a green one.

[01:48:17.110 --> 01:48:19.290]
Oh, sorry, son, I took off the green ones.

[01:48:19.410 --> 01:48:21.370]
I did add my two boys.

[01:48:22.310 --> 01:48:23.370]
New, am an animal.

[01:48:23.730 --> 01:48:25.270]
Melt's in your butt, not in your head.

[01:48:25.890 --> 01:48:27.070]
Okay, who was that on the bat line?

[01:48:27.250 --> 01:48:27.770]
Those are facts.

[01:48:28.370 --> 01:48:28.890]
It's a wrong number.

[01:48:29.810 --> 01:48:30.530]
In other words.

[01:48:31.310 --> 01:48:33.830]
No, and then you sent him that the bat line number?

[01:48:34.270 --> 01:48:36.270]
Yes, but I didn't send him that incorrect number.

[01:48:38.070 --> 01:48:38.950]
What do you mean by that?

[01:48:40.930 --> 01:48:41.930]
What does that mean?

[01:48:42.990 --> 01:48:47.170]
We get wrong numbers on the bat line all the time, as you know.

[01:48:47.690 --> 01:48:48.050]
Yeah.

[01:48:48.450 --> 01:48:50.110]
People think that that's the facts number?

[01:48:50.470 --> 01:48:51.910]
No, I think that was Joel cranking you.

[01:48:52.670 --> 01:48:53.210]
Could be?

[01:48:54.090 --> 01:48:55.190]
845 votes on the pool.

[01:48:55.350 --> 01:48:56.810]
Yes, he'd just be careful with him.

[01:48:56.930 --> 01:48:57.990]
Okay, he's not one of those people.

[01:48:58.050 --> 01:48:59.210]
He would do anything to hurt us.

[01:48:59.770 --> 01:49:00.170]
That's what I heard.

[01:49:01.090 --> 01:49:02.710]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[01:49:02.750 --> 01:49:04.190]
We're moving across the street, baby.

[01:49:04.310 --> 01:49:05.030]
We're going to the ticket.

[01:49:05.030 --> 01:49:06.030]
We're leaving now.

[01:49:06.270 --> 01:49:10.070]
See, if I was him, I'd be on, if Norma Kent was like a real agent.

[01:49:10.870 --> 01:49:14.390]
Instead of talking about his dead dogs and stuff like that, he'd be on the foam with Joel right now.

[01:49:14.490 --> 01:49:17.310]
And Joel, of course, he don't want to be bothered with him because he doesn't deal with middlemen.

[01:49:17.470 --> 01:49:17.710]
That's right.

[01:49:17.870 --> 01:49:18.350]
Small potatoes.

[01:49:18.630 --> 01:49:20.830]
He can't be bothered with the pimps with middlemen.

[01:49:21.030 --> 01:49:21.990]
No, he can't say pimps.

[01:49:22.510 --> 01:49:23.010]
That's right.

[01:49:24.890 --> 01:49:26.490]
Like Titania, he was up pimped.

[01:49:28.110 --> 01:49:28.710]
WQAM, hello.

[01:49:29.310 --> 01:49:30.330]
I want to speak to Joyce.

[01:49:33.230 --> 01:49:33.870]
Oh, boy.

[01:49:34.290 --> 01:49:35.010]
Don't I wish?

[01:49:35.210 --> 01:49:36.850]
Remember we used to have that as the manager, Crap?

[01:49:37.490 --> 01:49:37.730]
Mm-hmm.

[01:49:38.450 --> 01:49:39.510]
What, that was an IOD here.

[01:49:39.510 --> 01:49:40.130]
We got Joyce here.

[01:49:40.350 --> 01:49:41.530]
No, no, no, no, no.

[01:49:41.610 --> 01:49:42.670]
Who used to do that?

[01:49:42.830 --> 01:49:44.190]
Was that, uh, Asda manager?

[01:49:44.370 --> 01:49:45.050]
I don't know.

[01:49:45.110 --> 01:49:47.350]
Or, no, we used to have asked the program director on here, didn't we?

[01:49:47.590 --> 01:49:48.510]
Yeah, I'm a hoisting.

[01:49:48.770 --> 01:49:48.810]
Yeah, hoisting.

[01:49:49.990 --> 01:49:50.610]
Hank, did it?

[01:49:50.990 --> 01:49:52.190]
Yeah, asked the program director.

[01:49:52.550 --> 01:49:52.870]
Wow.

[01:49:53.550 --> 01:49:57.110]
A lot of questions this audience would like to ask the program director if we could find that simple.

[01:49:57.170 --> 01:49:59.810]
And if you've seen him lately, Clarence is he still showing up there or what?

[01:50:00.830 --> 01:50:01.530]
Haven't seen him lately.

[01:50:02.390 --> 01:50:03.830]
Now, when do you sound like in a good mood?

[01:50:04.010 --> 01:50:05.250]
It's part of those big B.M.s.

[01:50:06.130 --> 01:50:06.730]
WQAM, hello.

[01:50:07.370 --> 01:50:09.110]
Neil, how about psycho.com?

[01:50:09.350 --> 01:50:10.930]
It's so easy, even if it's in WAM.

[01:50:11.430 --> 01:50:12.990]
And QAM, then, can do it.

[01:50:13.270 --> 01:50:13.390]
Yeah, that's it.

[01:50:17.770 --> 01:50:18.470]
WQAM, hello.

[01:50:19.330 --> 01:50:19.730]
Yes.

[01:50:20.750 --> 01:50:21.430]
What is it?

[01:50:22.350 --> 01:50:23.690]
How come I can't hear these callers?

[01:50:23.730 --> 01:50:26.650]
If you've got the pot closed or they don't know, they just be weird.

[01:50:27.150 --> 01:50:28.450]
Oh, WQAM, hello.

[01:50:28.990 --> 01:50:29.810]
Hey Neil, how are you?

[01:50:30.030 --> 01:50:30.430]
Okay, sir.

[01:50:30.970 --> 01:50:33.830]
Yeah, I agree with you about the reshuffling of the talent.

[01:50:33.830 --> 01:50:36.710]
It kind of reminds me of the professional 14th grade.

[01:50:39.470 --> 01:50:40.150]
And QAM, you know, the re-tread.

[01:50:40.150 --> 01:50:40.150]

[01:50:40.150 --> 01:50:40.410]
That's correct.

[01:50:41.590 --> 01:50:42.970]
You know, the re-tread.

[01:50:43.210 --> 01:50:43.410]
Yeah.

[01:50:44.370 --> 01:50:50.330]
That question, when you had Rick Shaw on last week, he said he forgot to turn down the, uh,

[01:50:50.710 --> 01:50:51.770]
closest to wattage.

[01:50:51.870 --> 01:50:54.670]
One night, we could hear the signal way out.

[01:50:55.170 --> 01:50:55.350]
Right.

[01:50:55.650 --> 01:50:58.370]
Hundreds of, why don't they do that for a night time?

[01:50:58.570 --> 01:50:59.610]
It's things like all of this.

[01:50:59.630 --> 01:51:01.290]
You can't hear the spaces that well.

[01:51:01.430 --> 01:51:01.950]
And I guess that's the thing.

[01:51:01.950 --> 01:51:03.150]
You have to protect the signal.

[01:51:03.150 --> 01:51:03.870]
Let's see FCC.

[01:51:04.090 --> 01:51:07.330]
It's the order to protect the signal, those, uh, other stations on your frequency.

[01:51:08.150 --> 01:51:08.850]
Uh, okay.

[01:51:09.050 --> 01:51:11.190]
Well, I guess the, uh, the answer might be...

[01:51:11.190 --> 01:51:13.190]
It's because AM radio, AM radio is a...

[01:51:13.190 --> 01:51:13.630]
BAM, BAM!

[01:51:13.950 --> 01:51:15.250]
Oh, I messed with that, yeah.

[01:51:15.570 --> 01:51:17.210]
Well, I even learned today is terrible.

[01:51:17.550 --> 01:51:19.370]
I mean at night, it seems an honor times work.

[01:51:19.810 --> 01:51:19.950]
Yeah.

[01:51:20.370 --> 01:51:21.470]
But you have a nice day, Neil.

[01:51:21.730 --> 01:51:22.430]
And back to you, pal.

[01:51:22.570 --> 01:51:23.230]
Thanks for the good news.

[01:51:25.550 --> 01:51:26.850]
5670560, pound 568.

[01:51:26.910 --> 01:51:29.430]
You would think now, like, I shouldn't say you would think.

[01:51:29.830 --> 01:51:31.390]
You may be back in the day you would think.

[01:51:31.390 --> 01:51:32.350]
And we had an audience.

[01:51:33.050 --> 01:51:36.290]
But after that revolutionary call from Joel Feinberg, the general manager,

[01:51:36.510 --> 01:51:39.130]
cross the street of the ticket, 790 on the dial, our new employer,

[01:51:39.690 --> 01:51:43.930]
and our agree, you know, the fact that we agreed to negotiate a new deal for us to go over there on Monday,

[01:51:44.170 --> 01:51:45.870]
you'd think that this audience would be...

[01:51:45.870 --> 01:51:47.430]
The phones would be on fire, wouldn't you?

[01:51:47.890 --> 01:51:48.650]
What, what do they care?

[01:51:48.750 --> 01:51:49.630]
They tune into this one.

[01:51:49.730 --> 01:51:50.470]
They tune into that one.

[01:51:50.470 --> 01:51:50.890]
What difference?

[01:51:53.710 --> 01:51:55.510]
280, uh, kilo cycles on the dial.

[01:51:57.070 --> 01:51:59.390]
Now, 790, the interesting part of that would be...

[01:51:59.390 --> 01:52:00.910]
Because that used to be WNWS.

[01:52:01.430 --> 01:52:02.970]
It also used to be WFUN.

[01:52:03.670 --> 01:52:03.890]
Right?

[01:52:04.230 --> 01:52:05.210]
Those are great call letters.

[01:52:05.310 --> 01:52:05.970]
Who's got those now?

[01:52:07.110 --> 01:52:07.650]
Somebody's somewhere.

[01:52:07.930 --> 01:52:08.470]
Somebody's smart.

[01:52:08.830 --> 01:52:08.990]
Yeah.

[01:52:09.030 --> 01:52:10.290]
But anyway, then it was WNWS.

[01:52:10.670 --> 01:52:11.030]
WNWS.

[01:52:11.310 --> 01:52:14.670]
And of course, the reason the cash per chose those call letters is we were all news in the beginning,

[01:52:14.670 --> 01:52:15.770]
except for at night a talk.

[01:52:16.410 --> 01:52:17.430]
Me and the Jerry Wischner.

[01:52:20.390 --> 01:52:23.570]
So, wouldn't that be, like, kind of like turning the clock back, going back to 790?

[01:52:23.810 --> 01:52:24.290]
Which I...

[01:52:24.290 --> 01:52:25.190]
What were you saying?

[01:52:25.450 --> 01:52:28.190]
I think there are 10,000 lots I do believe.

[01:52:29.150 --> 01:52:30.290]
I mean, I don't really know them.

[01:52:30.310 --> 01:52:31.090]
Maybe they've got a better signal.

[01:52:31.150 --> 01:52:31.990]
I know we'd get some promotion.

[01:52:31.990 --> 01:52:32.870]
We'd get billboards.

[01:52:32.990 --> 01:52:36.850]
I think Joe Fyneburg personally would go up and down Lincoln Road, mall with a sandwich board.

[01:52:37.090 --> 01:52:38.610]
Neil Rogers is on my station.

[01:52:38.790 --> 01:52:39.990]
Oh my God, the rider.

[01:52:40.250 --> 01:52:40.870]
Wouldn't that be something?

[01:52:41.850 --> 01:52:42.330]
That'd be something.

[01:52:42.710 --> 01:52:46.150]
And I bet you he wouldn't threaten to put tapes on in the summer time around Fridays or whatever

[01:52:46.150 --> 01:52:47.010]
while when you were on.

[01:52:47.290 --> 01:52:48.850]
Like, like, fat ass, jolly, jolly.

[01:52:49.050 --> 01:52:52.310]
Who hates you like poison, because Greg Reed told him you ought to.

[01:52:52.550 --> 01:52:52.910]
Apparently.

[01:52:53.650 --> 01:52:54.010]
WNWS.

[01:52:55.190 --> 01:52:56.430]
I got a plate.

[01:52:57.310 --> 01:52:57.950]
WQAM, hello.

[01:52:58.710 --> 01:53:00.390]
Yes, I'd like to set up a day with Neil.

[01:53:01.230 --> 01:53:02.130]
You want to do what?

[01:53:02.350 --> 01:53:02.790]
Set up a picture.

[01:53:03.470 --> 01:53:04.530]
Send a picture of what?

[01:53:05.270 --> 01:53:06.630]
He wants to have a date with you.

[01:53:07.390 --> 01:53:08.410]
Oh, he set up a date now.

[01:53:09.030 --> 01:53:09.650]
WQAM, hello.

[01:53:09.810 --> 01:53:10.990]
George already said, send a picture.

[01:53:11.170 --> 01:53:11.530]
QAM.

[01:53:12.170 --> 01:53:13.450]
Hey, good afternoon, Neil.

[01:53:13.870 --> 01:53:14.570]
Good afternoon, sir.

[01:53:15.170 --> 01:53:19.730]
Hey, now that Bob Arrotti's dead, you think the other 210ers will try to recruit Rick Sanchez?

[01:53:21.270 --> 01:53:21.990]
WNWS, hello.

[01:53:22.890 --> 01:53:26.850]
You know, the true motive would is war with N.S. Revealed during his abs.

[01:53:26.990 --> 01:53:27.690]
The picture of what?

[01:53:27.850 --> 01:53:28.730]
So he is back for his abs.

[01:53:28.830 --> 01:53:29.330]
No, that's possible.

[01:53:29.630 --> 01:53:30.770]
The true would have spoke off in Iraq.

[01:53:30.890 --> 01:53:32.050]
That is the father's expected photo.

[01:53:32.230 --> 01:53:35.170]
The way in how he was not in compared to the expected old one, unfiltered off.

[01:53:35.250 --> 01:53:35.770]
What was that?

[01:53:35.790 --> 01:53:36.290]
Is that Rush?

[01:53:36.610 --> 01:53:37.550]
That somebody's playing the back?

[01:53:39.050 --> 01:53:39.570]
I don't know.

[01:53:40.070 --> 01:53:40.770]
I have no idea.

[01:53:40.910 --> 01:53:43.130]
I couldn't hear because it was, I am, I'm a little bit more like that.

[01:53:44.250 --> 01:53:47.090]
567-0560, Palm 562 in the Verizon Singular Wireless Line.

[01:53:47.290 --> 01:53:49.030]
You're not helping me, folks, make my decision.

[01:53:50.310 --> 01:53:54.170]
We're trying to work with the audience to see whether we should just fly to Coop and go right across the street.

[01:53:54.410 --> 01:53:56.690]
And I wouldn't have to go anywhere, you would, but I wouldn't have to go anywhere.

[01:53:56.870 --> 01:53:57.010]
Right.

[01:53:57.590 --> 01:53:59.070]
Because I'm sure that Joel would sit up.

[01:53:59.270 --> 01:54:02.050]
All I have to do is just dial up this number and connect the, you know, with...

[01:54:02.050 --> 01:54:03.210]
Sure, just flip a switch.

[01:54:03.570 --> 01:54:05.350]
Just flip a switch and by the way, there I would be.

[01:54:05.490 --> 01:54:06.770]
Because I would have to be part of the deal.

[01:54:06.890 --> 01:54:10.090]
Trust my 40-week-see-your-vecation plus the summary of the deal, you know.

[01:54:10.410 --> 01:54:13.370]
Plus getting paid several days earlier, repay the...

[01:54:13.370 --> 01:54:14.170]
All of these...

[01:54:14.170 --> 01:54:15.110]
All of these things.

[01:54:15.970 --> 01:54:16.790]
WNQ-Y-M, hello.

[01:54:17.690 --> 01:54:18.790]
How you doing, N.S.?

[01:54:18.790 --> 01:54:19.350]
Okay, sir.

[01:54:19.970 --> 01:54:20.570]
All right.

[01:54:20.790 --> 01:54:24.130]
I just wanted to say something about that one guy, Mayor Nargo.

[01:54:24.570 --> 01:54:29.210]
You know, instead of calling him the anti-gay toilet, they should call him the anti-republic in toilet.

[01:54:31.190 --> 01:54:32.070]
WNQ-Y-M, hello.

[01:54:32.770 --> 01:54:34.290]
Oh, yeah, N.S.?

[01:54:34.290 --> 01:54:36.930]
What is it?

[01:54:37.610 --> 01:54:37.730]
What is it?

[01:54:37.730 --> 01:54:38.710]
It's the word combination.

[01:54:39.430 --> 01:54:40.690]
I know 790.

[01:54:40.890 --> 01:54:41.930]
But let me ask you something.

[01:54:42.110 --> 01:54:42.610]
Let me ask you.

[01:54:42.810 --> 01:54:45.910]
Is it your phone or have you got some kind of intestinal problem?

[01:54:46.110 --> 01:54:46.790]
Because I can just...

[01:54:46.790 --> 01:54:48.410]
You sound like you're straining.

[01:54:48.410 --> 01:54:50.030]
How come I can't hear you?

[01:54:50.130 --> 01:54:50.830]
I don't know.

[01:54:51.090 --> 01:54:51.730]
I'm already now.

[01:54:52.050 --> 01:54:52.970]
A little bit better.

[01:54:53.030 --> 01:54:54.130]
The worst phone in history.

[01:54:54.250 --> 01:54:55.370]
What kind of a phone is that?

[01:54:55.470 --> 01:54:56.130]
Don't tell us.

[01:54:56.290 --> 01:54:56.850]
Go ahead.

[01:54:57.250 --> 01:54:59.030]
I just think what a combination.

[01:55:00.390 --> 01:55:00.830]
If...

[01:55:00.830 --> 01:55:01.950]
That's in my head, you.

[01:55:02.450 --> 01:55:02.770]
Yeah.

[01:55:02.930 --> 01:55:03.470]
Get a new phone.

[01:55:05.030 --> 01:55:05.950]
WNQ-Y-M, hello.

[01:55:06.810 --> 01:55:08.030]
I would say no.

[01:55:08.570 --> 01:55:09.510]
I would not move.

[01:55:10.230 --> 01:55:12.730]
If I was you, I would not move.

[01:55:12.870 --> 01:55:14.990]
If I was you, you hear?

[01:55:15.630 --> 01:55:16.650]
If you say it again.

[01:55:16.790 --> 01:55:17.170]
He was me.

[01:55:17.170 --> 01:55:17.170]

[01:55:17.170 --> 01:55:17.170]

[01:55:17.190 --> 01:55:17.590]
Yeah.

[01:55:18.470 --> 01:55:23.350]
I would say, because you know, Greg Bell might not be too mad at you if you we.

[01:55:23.930 --> 01:55:24.410]
Greg Bell?

[01:55:25.570 --> 01:55:28.450]
I'm saying if you we, so don't think that Greg.

[01:55:29.090 --> 01:55:29.990]
WQ-Y-M, hello.

[01:55:32.510 --> 01:55:33.310]
Q-I-M.

[01:55:35.450 --> 01:55:36.070]
Not there.

[01:55:36.210 --> 01:55:38.090]
Boy, that's one of the data sound aligns, I've ever heard.

[01:55:38.090 --> 01:55:38.790]
That is very quiet.

[01:55:38.990 --> 01:55:39.390]
I like it.

[01:55:39.570 --> 01:55:40.130]
Q-I-M, hello.

[01:55:40.390 --> 01:55:41.310]
It was an improvement over that.

[01:55:41.650 --> 01:55:42.250]
Q-I-M, hello.

[01:55:42.750 --> 01:55:44.870]
You should go to 790 and do a show.

[01:55:45.090 --> 01:55:45.510]
It's too bad.

[01:55:45.510 --> 01:55:48.050]
I still got oh there's the stu-gots lady yeah

[01:55:49.290 --> 01:55:53.750]
Played he is right another person who don't belong on a year stu-gots even for a second

[01:55:53.750 --> 01:55:58.030]
I just looked at their website by the way that the George Sedan was not a bad looking kid that works over there

[01:55:58.030 --> 01:56:01.670]
I mentioned that to you before did you he looks all the long time ago and I said he's

[01:56:01.670 --> 01:56:08.290]
I don't mean you your speed yeah he looks pretty good but the stu-gots he don't sound pretty good or look pretty good

[01:56:08.290 --> 01:56:12.990]
He don't belong on a year and he's got a witch dad and he's the what is he now is he the station manager is that his title?

[01:56:12.990 --> 01:56:18.350]
I mean the whole it's it's laughable baby next thing Robert Griefer is gonna be the general manager QIM

[01:56:18.350 --> 01:56:23.650]
because he knows where all the bodies are buried he knows where all the naked pictures are the beeslies

[01:56:23.650 --> 01:56:42.970]
yeah and the billi-gothes well I'm so glad I'm not playing those awful John Fesenda junior

[01:56:42.970 --> 01:56:47.730]
Good morning Americans it's Paul Harvey stand by for news

[01:56:48.330 --> 01:56:55.550]
George placed a bouquet of flowers on the grave of his dearly departed mother and then started back towards his car

[01:56:56.090 --> 01:56:59.890]
When his attention was diverted to another man kneeling at a grave site

[01:57:00.410 --> 01:57:02.610]
The man seemed to be praying with profound

[01:57:03.930 --> 01:57:09.810]
Intensity and kept repeating why did you have to die? Why did you have to die? Why?

[01:57:10.350 --> 01:57:12.490]
Did you have to die?

[01:57:13.290 --> 01:57:17.230]
George approached him and said sir, I don't wish to interfere with your private grief

[01:57:17.230 --> 01:57:24.370]
But this demonstration of pain is more than I have ever seen before for whom do you mourn so deeply a child?

[01:57:24.930 --> 01:57:25.450]
apparent

[01:57:26.330 --> 01:57:30.430]
The man took a moment to collect himself and then replied my wife's first husband

[01:57:31.070 --> 01:57:32.350]
now page two

[01:57:32.890 --> 01:57:37.570]
Carl was strolling down the street as he passed the large building with a fence around it

[01:57:37.570 --> 01:57:43.230]
He heard a group of people chanting 69 69 69 over and over again

[01:57:44.310 --> 01:57:47.890]
Curious Carl tried to see over the fence but could not

[01:57:48.610 --> 01:57:51.450]
And then he spotted a hole in the wooden fence

[01:57:52.130 --> 01:57:57.550]
He put his eye to the hole and managed to spy some old people sitting in deck chairs chanting

[01:57:58.210 --> 01:58:02.090]
Before a finger came out of nowhere and poked him in the eye as he staggered back

[01:58:02.090 --> 01:58:05.950]
He heard the chant 70 70 70

[01:58:05.950 --> 01:58:07.170]
Paul Harvey

[01:58:07.170 --> 01:58:08.150]

I'll tell you one thing the audience is just in a frenzy about Joel Feinberg's call man

[01:58:16.690 --> 01:58:17.650]
I made an impact today

[01:58:17.650 --> 01:58:18.150]
I can tell

[01:58:18.150 --> 01:58:22.510]
I just checked the amized space both of the sites and there was one message

[01:58:22.510 --> 01:58:25.850]
There was an any not a rumble not a not even a trickle

[01:58:25.850 --> 01:58:29.670]
Not like a ripple in the water when you throw like a little pebble across the lake

[01:58:29.670 --> 01:58:31.530]
There's not even like a little ripple you know

[01:58:31.530 --> 01:58:32.730]
Maybe they're drinking some ripple

[01:58:32.730 --> 01:58:34.810]
I have plenty of acting on mind but not about that

[01:58:34.810 --> 01:58:35.910]
You've had what?

[01:58:36.210 --> 01:58:37.990]
Plenty of action on my my space but not about that

[01:58:37.990 --> 01:58:38.630]
You have?

[01:58:38.810 --> 01:58:41.430]
That's because you're doing all kinds of whoopee on yours

[01:58:42.050 --> 01:58:43.870]
Well I better start doing that

[01:58:43.870 --> 01:58:44.330]

WDQ-YM Hello

[01:59:28.550 --> 01:59:30.790]
Just sitting in your car like the speedy Camel

[01:59:30.790 --> 01:59:31.990]
It ain't like you always can do

[01:59:32.550 --> 01:59:33.070]
What is it?

[01:59:34.490 --> 01:59:35.170]
What do you say?

[01:59:35.370 --> 01:59:36.750]
That's the mailing it in guide

[01:59:36.750 --> 01:59:38.330]
We have an in here what he said

[01:59:38.330 --> 01:59:39.230]
Blah blah blah

[01:59:39.230 --> 01:59:40.570]
Mail it in like you always say

[01:59:40.570 --> 01:59:41.530]
Yeah mail this okay

[01:59:41.530 --> 01:59:42.130]

Pound 560 on the Verizon singular wireless line

[01:59:46.670 --> 01:59:48.110]
There's not a call on that board

[01:59:48.110 --> 01:59:49.450]
Maybe it's his dead as a doormel

[01:59:49.450 --> 01:59:51.110]
We were really on our way

[01:59:51.110 --> 01:59:52.810]
I think maybe the whole Joel fineberg thing

[01:59:52.810 --> 01:59:53.870]
Maybe that was a plot

[01:59:53.870 --> 01:59:55.310]
Because he would do anything to hurt us

[01:59:56.030 --> 01:59:57.610]
Kind of threw us off our feed

[01:59:59.250 --> 02:00:01.350]
Ginger you know that's this market for you

[02:00:01.350 --> 02:00:03.390]
The only time it's predictable is like

[02:00:03.390 --> 02:00:05.330]
When it's alien and something ethnic or something

[02:00:05.330 --> 02:00:06.510]
It has to with good hate

[02:00:06.510 --> 02:00:07.550]
Good old country hate

[02:00:07.550 --> 02:00:09.310]
As Joe Dodg-Yola would say

[02:00:09.310 --> 02:00:11.750]
Good old country hardball and good old country hate

[02:00:11.750 --> 02:00:12.590]
That's what they did

[02:00:12.590 --> 02:00:14.130]
Sink their teeth and do

[02:00:14.830 --> 02:00:16.810]
But something revolutionary like the GM

[02:00:16.810 --> 02:00:17.650]
From across the street

[02:00:17.650 --> 02:00:19.350]
Calling to offer me a job on here

[02:00:19.350 --> 02:00:20.430]

I wish you leave them because Q-A-M

[02:00:46.730 --> 02:00:47.550]
Treats you like crap

[02:00:47.550 --> 02:00:49.750]
And they think

[02:00:49.750 --> 02:00:50.930]
That they can do with you

[02:00:50.930 --> 02:00:51.650]
Whatever they want because

[02:00:51.650 --> 02:00:53.350]
Probably no one else would pick you up

[02:00:53.350 --> 02:00:55.950]
Because of the media consolidation and all that stuff

[02:00:55.950 --> 02:00:57.430]
I think you should leave and go

[02:00:57.430 --> 02:00:58.990]
He obviously wants to waste money

[02:00:58.990 --> 02:00:59.930]
And if he goes down the air

[02:00:59.930 --> 02:01:00.910]
To you know

[02:01:00.910 --> 02:01:02.770]
Like that from there some so

[02:01:02.770 --> 02:01:04.270]
At least he wants to you know

[02:01:04.270 --> 02:01:06.830]
How is he bad man he wants me real bad

[02:01:06.830 --> 02:01:09.230]
Everybody said about something about a pickle I heard that

[02:01:09.890 --> 02:01:11.050]
Have a great day pali

[02:01:11.050 --> 02:01:11.490]
Okay

[02:01:11.490 --> 02:01:12.210]
You too well

[02:01:12.210 --> 02:01:13.610]
I'll read the dirge

[02:01:13.610 --> 02:01:14.810]
WDQ-YM Hello

[02:01:18.650 --> 02:01:19.610]
Okay pali

I can totally see you at 790

[02:01:21.770 --> 02:01:23.090]
With more hours

[02:01:23.090 --> 02:01:25.290]
You guys back together again back and forth

[02:01:25.290 --> 02:01:25.790]
If you grab me

[02:01:25.790 --> 02:01:25.890]
Yeah

[02:01:27.750 --> 02:01:28.710]
WDQ-YM Hello

[02:01:31.390 --> 02:01:31.830]
WDQ-YM

[02:01:31.830 --> 02:01:32.310]
Q-A-M

[02:01:32.310 --> 02:01:33.650]
Oh yeah I'm sorry

[02:01:34.590 --> 02:01:35.370]
First of all

[02:01:35.370 --> 02:01:36.650]
If you left Q-A-M

[02:01:36.650 --> 02:01:38.530]
Now if you like the death sentence for that station

[02:01:38.530 --> 02:01:39.090]
Yeah

[02:01:39.570 --> 02:01:42.250]
And can you maybe recap the series of events

[02:01:42.250 --> 02:01:44.310]
That led to this for people who are in here

[02:01:45.330 --> 02:01:47.330]
Well what do you mean by series of events

[02:01:47.330 --> 02:01:47.930]
Well yeah

[02:01:47.930 --> 02:01:50.110]
I read you he made a call on Monday

[02:01:50.110 --> 02:01:51.550]
But I'd like to hear a little more information

[02:01:51.550 --> 02:01:53.170]
A little more detail about how that went

[02:01:53.170 --> 02:01:54.990]
No no he's going to make a call on Monday

[02:01:54.990 --> 02:01:56.410]
The next Monday

[02:01:56.770 --> 02:01:59.390]
Is that even really possible for you to go every day

[02:02:00.610 --> 02:02:01.830]
Well you never know

[02:02:01.830 --> 02:02:03.050]
All right if you do

[02:02:03.050 --> 02:02:04.110]
I'll do a fire

[02:02:04.110 --> 02:02:05.530]
Okay thank you so much

[02:02:05.530 --> 02:02:06.890]
Well you never know because you know

[02:02:06.890 --> 02:02:07.950]
That's one thing when people keep

[02:02:07.950 --> 02:02:09.570]
There's been no promotion of this show

[02:02:09.570 --> 02:02:11.750]
They've violated every part of the con

[02:02:11.750 --> 02:02:13.910]
In fact the interesting part of it is on Monday morning

[02:02:13.910 --> 02:02:15.950]
I'll whip it out in the contract too

[02:02:15.950 --> 02:02:17.310]
I got it sitting in the drawer over here

[02:02:17.890 --> 02:02:18.970]
I've got it in my drawers

[02:02:18.970 --> 02:02:19.850]
You'll whip it

[02:02:20.270 --> 02:02:21.150]
I'll whip it out

[02:02:21.690 --> 02:02:22.650]
For Joel Feinberg

[02:02:22.650 --> 02:02:23.770]
Well he said something about the

[02:02:23.770 --> 02:02:25.130]
Putting the old pickle in the barrel

[02:02:25.130 --> 02:02:26.710]
I don't know it's something like a come on to me

[02:02:26.710 --> 02:02:28.510]
Now George Sagan will throw him in the deal

[02:02:28.510 --> 02:02:29.310]
There okay Joel

[02:02:29.910 --> 02:02:32.070]
Maybe you'll have maybe you'll have the deal

[02:02:32.070 --> 02:02:33.730]
He could be your onsite producer there

[02:02:33.730 --> 02:02:34.890]
Into where you go yeah

[02:02:35.750 --> 02:02:37.450]
I do him onsite I'll tell you that

[02:02:37.450 --> 02:02:39.650]
At least if it's on the picture on the website

[02:02:40.350 --> 02:02:41.430]
What do you laugh about

[02:02:41.430 --> 02:02:43.290]
Oh I was crystallizing the buddy face

[02:02:43.770 --> 02:02:44.990]
He's probably not a broadcast

[02:02:44.990 --> 02:02:46.370]
You're I don't know I have no idea

[02:02:46.370 --> 02:02:47.390]
What kind of a show he's doing

[02:02:47.390 --> 02:02:48.830]
Of them sports

[02:02:50.850 --> 02:02:51.450]
WDQYM Hello

[02:02:52.250 --> 02:02:53.830]
I think they're quite the man's element

[02:02:54.750 --> 02:02:55.870]
WDQYM Hello

[02:02:55.870 --> 02:02:56.910]
A deal

[02:02:56.910 --> 02:02:57.710]
Yes sir

[02:02:57.710 --> 02:03:00.530]
The LDS capture lighting and a bottle

[02:03:00.530 --> 02:03:01.910]
Of the check-out

[02:03:02.650 --> 02:03:03.970]
He is doing it

[02:03:03.970 --> 02:03:05.890]
Yes, it's

[02:03:05.890 --> 02:03:07.930]
Let that serve out their food

[02:03:07.930 --> 02:03:08.710]
And just

[02:03:08.710 --> 02:03:09.970]
We see each other's fun

[02:03:09.970 --> 02:03:11.230]
They're probably going to tell us

[02:03:11.230 --> 02:03:12.750]
That they love it

[02:03:12.750 --> 02:03:14.350]
Okay dump that please

[02:03:15.030 --> 02:03:17.290]
I would I'll do it here but I don't know if it's going to be

[02:03:17.290 --> 02:03:18.890]
Yeah, we got it

[02:03:18.890 --> 02:03:23.210]
5 6 7 0 5 6 8 5 6 10 the Verizon singular wireless line

[02:03:23.210 --> 02:03:24.730]
Gildey has got lighting and a bottle

[02:03:24.730 --> 02:03:26.410]
Maybe that's why he sounds like that

[02:03:27.110 --> 02:03:29.630]
That would that would explain a lot

[02:03:31.270 --> 02:03:32.050]
WDQYM Hello

[02:03:32.690 --> 02:03:33.910]
Hello Howard just called

[02:03:33.910 --> 02:03:35.770]
That get his name off your pole

[02:03:35.770 --> 02:03:36.270]
Meal boy

[02:03:36.270 --> 02:03:36.830]
Go away

[02:03:38.090 --> 02:03:38.870]
WDQYM Hello

[02:03:39.690 --> 02:03:40.410]
Hello Neil

[02:03:40.410 --> 02:03:41.030]
Yes

[02:03:41.610 --> 02:03:44.090]
I already voted on the pole last night

[02:03:44.090 --> 02:03:45.550]
And I voted for Scott Poel

[02:03:45.550 --> 02:03:47.990]
Because not that I listen to anyone else

[02:03:47.990 --> 02:03:49.830]
That you on QAM but

[02:03:50.390 --> 02:03:51.890]
Or always absolutely the worst

[02:03:51.890 --> 02:03:53.850]
I do miss Mo Howard because he

[02:03:53.850 --> 02:03:56.930]
Provided you with some of the best material you've ever had

[02:03:56.930 --> 02:03:58.030]
To do do do do

[02:03:58.030 --> 02:03:59.750]
Two things real quick

[02:03:59.750 --> 02:04:00.630]
You mentioned that

[02:04:01.770 --> 02:04:03.610]
Religious person that just died

[02:04:03.610 --> 02:04:04.850]
And one of the things

[02:04:04.850 --> 02:04:06.590]
You know you're always talking about

[02:04:07.190 --> 02:04:08.270]
How you know

[02:04:08.270 --> 02:04:11.210]
We always pay attention to the Lindy row hands

[02:04:11.210 --> 02:04:13.210]
And the parents help him to not be important things

[02:04:13.210 --> 02:04:15.570]
And I'm in complete agreement with that

[02:04:15.570 --> 02:04:18.670]
But what this Tammy say that piece of crap died

[02:04:18.670 --> 02:04:21.370]
Recently the group or that came out

[02:04:21.370 --> 02:04:24.030]
And said what a wonderful she woman is

[02:04:24.030 --> 02:04:25.110]
What women she was

[02:04:25.110 --> 02:04:26.090]
She woman now

[02:04:26.090 --> 02:04:28.310]
They seem to forget that

[02:04:28.310 --> 02:04:29.890]
Her husband went to jail

[02:04:29.890 --> 02:04:31.910]
But when she was a part of the whole thing

[02:04:31.910 --> 02:04:34.790]
She was just as much of a con artist as he was

[02:04:34.790 --> 02:04:35.730]
A lot of those people

[02:04:35.730 --> 02:04:38.810]
That they took advantage of were elderly people

[02:04:38.810 --> 02:04:40.330]
And with the trailer parks

[02:04:40.330 --> 02:04:43.370]
I mean this woman was nothing short

[02:04:44.170 --> 02:04:46.030]
And the last thing in closing is

[02:04:46.030 --> 02:04:47.510]
What I think like to rely on

[02:04:47.510 --> 02:04:51.610]
And comedy central I think 11 p.m.

[02:04:51.770 --> 02:04:53.970]
Or midnight is Bob and Tom's second

[02:04:55.350 --> 02:04:56.130]
Comedy tour

[02:04:56.670 --> 02:04:57.150]
Okay

[02:04:57.770 --> 02:04:59.630]
So you may want to keep out or whatever

[02:04:59.630 --> 02:05:02.070]
They're kicking ass up here in Palm Beach County

[02:05:02.070 --> 02:05:03.350]
I listen to them every day

[02:05:03.350 --> 02:05:04.990]
I just took them off the air

[02:05:04.990 --> 02:05:05.650]
They're taking them on

[02:05:05.650 --> 02:05:08.630]
I heard you say that the other day

[02:05:08.630 --> 02:05:09.810]
And you know what

[02:05:09.810 --> 02:05:10.870]
It's it's foolish

[02:05:10.870 --> 02:05:13.510]
Because they dominate up here every morning

[02:05:14.070 --> 02:05:15.450]
And I can I've been listening to them

[02:05:15.450 --> 02:05:16.890]
For I guess over five years

[02:05:17.330 --> 02:05:19.110]
What a shame it would have been if they were

[02:05:19.110 --> 02:05:20.030]
Would have put them on this station

[02:05:20.030 --> 02:05:21.070]
Would that have been a bad move

[02:05:21.670 --> 02:05:23.410]
Yeah you don't think they can double

[02:05:23.410 --> 02:05:25.070]
What you're making now that's all

[02:05:25.070 --> 02:05:26.070]
Good luck to us pal

[02:05:26.070 --> 02:05:26.850]
You have a great day

[02:05:26.850 --> 02:05:29.970]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the

[02:05:29.970 --> 02:05:31.950]
For writing then that's because they don't do a sport show

[02:05:31.950 --> 02:05:33.470]
Maybe they don't talk about the

[02:05:33.470 --> 02:05:37.190]
Keens the Keens and the fins and the fins and the

[02:05:37.190 --> 02:05:39.250]
Keens and the Keens and the fins

[02:05:39.250 --> 02:05:40.550]
Oh my god

[02:05:41.750 --> 02:05:43.530]
You see you think we got promised with calls

[02:05:43.530 --> 02:05:44.850]
All the way have a lot of them coming in now

[02:05:44.850 --> 02:05:46.610]
Because Joel Feinberg stirred up the audience

[02:05:46.610 --> 02:05:47.530]
He stirred the pot

[02:05:47.530 --> 02:05:50.030]
He stirred the pot and George started smoking it

[02:05:50.030 --> 02:05:51.770]
And you want us to put that in your contract too

[02:05:51.770 --> 02:05:53.810]
That you get so much weed every week with the deal

[02:05:53.810 --> 02:05:56.290]
Uh just I'll take the money and I'll buy the weed

[02:05:56.290 --> 02:05:57.310]
I know where to get it

[02:05:57.310 --> 02:05:57.470]
Oh

[02:05:57.470 --> 02:05:58.930]
Nobody Q I am hello

Thank you for taking my call

[02:06:03.970 --> 02:06:05.270]
Thank you for making your call yet

[02:06:05.270 --> 02:06:08.790]
Now is it true that Joe Rose is supposed to announce the game

[02:06:08.790 --> 02:06:10.510]
On Sunday but yeah

[02:06:10.510 --> 02:06:12.890]
That company hasn't said anything about that

[02:06:14.030 --> 02:06:15.210]
How to hell would I know

[02:06:16.630 --> 02:06:18.890]
Well there's supposed to be a three man

[02:06:19.670 --> 02:06:20.890]
Booth for the football

[02:06:20.890 --> 02:06:23.310]
Jimmy syphilis and the mad dog and the little dog

[02:06:23.310 --> 02:06:24.550]
Joe Rose supposed to be on the games

[02:06:24.550 --> 02:06:25.850]
I don't know what is he said

[02:06:25.850 --> 02:06:28.190]
They said that they have not announced

[02:06:28.190 --> 02:06:29.390]
Anything about it yet

[02:06:29.990 --> 02:06:31.430]
Mad dog was saying that yesterday on his show

[02:06:31.430 --> 02:06:32.530]
He was saying what

[02:06:32.530 --> 02:06:34.790]
That he's supposed to be doing the streetman booth

[02:06:34.790 --> 02:06:36.490]
But there's been no official announcement

[02:06:36.490 --> 02:06:37.570]
Nobody's talked to him

[02:06:37.570 --> 02:06:40.230]
There's been no meeting with the three of the guys together

[02:06:40.230 --> 02:06:41.850]
And that figures as per for the course

[02:06:41.850 --> 02:06:42.450]
Right Neil

[02:06:42.450 --> 02:06:44.370]

[02:06:56.370 --> 02:06:56.890]
I think so

[02:06:56.890 --> 02:06:57.950]
It's computer slow today

[02:06:57.950 --> 02:06:59.410]
I was saying 1961 or two

[02:06:59.410 --> 02:07:02.690]
I believe I was living in Boston back in the day when it was a big hit

[02:07:02.690 --> 02:07:03.510]
Terrible song

[02:07:03.510 --> 02:07:05.230]
I will follow him

[02:07:05.230 --> 02:07:06.250]
I don't know what it was

[02:07:06.250 --> 02:07:07.430]
I think that's pretty much

[02:07:08.290 --> 02:07:09.710]
I think the guy is dying

[02:07:10.250 --> 02:07:10.730]
You got it?

[02:07:11.290 --> 02:07:11.630]
No

[02:07:12.250 --> 02:07:13.390]
You don't know if you've got it

[02:07:13.850 --> 02:07:14.950]
No not getting it up

[02:07:14.950 --> 02:07:16.070]
More of that movie where Gibson

[02:07:16.070 --> 02:07:16.690]
I got it

[02:07:16.690 --> 02:07:17.210]
I got it

[02:07:17.210 --> 02:07:18.530]
Well that wasn't a funny movie at all

[02:07:18.530 --> 02:07:19.970]
I was high anxiety with Mel Brooks

[02:07:19.970 --> 02:07:21.490]
That was on a couple days ago

[02:07:21.490 --> 02:07:22.130]
And you know something

[02:07:22.650 --> 02:07:25.190]
Now there's a movie that supposedly is hilarious and etc

[02:07:25.190 --> 02:07:27.590]
And I had hadn't seen it in years

[02:07:27.590 --> 02:07:28.310]
It's not funny

[02:07:29.090 --> 02:07:29.790]
No it's not

[02:07:30.230 --> 02:07:31.570]
Not even remotely funny

[02:07:31.570 --> 02:07:32.410]
High anxiety

[02:07:32.850 --> 02:07:33.770]
Not that Mel Brooks

[02:07:33.770 --> 02:07:36.150]
Wasn't never funny but that's just a one of the

[02:07:36.150 --> 02:07:36.550]
And

[02:07:37.450 --> 02:07:39.410]
AFI the American Filaments to Tutes God

[02:07:40.190 --> 02:07:41.310]
After 100 years

[02:07:41.310 --> 02:07:43.130]
100 movies they're 10th anniversary edition

[02:07:43.130 --> 02:07:45.510]
The top 100 movies at the last 100 years

[02:07:45.510 --> 02:07:47.070]
Aren't you excited about that

[02:07:47.070 --> 02:07:48.010]
That would be a good pull

[02:07:48.010 --> 02:07:49.410]
Although then it would work

[02:07:49.410 --> 02:07:51.250]
They do that every year and they're all bogus

[02:07:51.250 --> 02:07:52.730]
And guess what's number one

[02:07:52.730 --> 02:07:53.470]
Citizen Kane

[02:07:53.470 --> 02:07:54.150]
Yes

[02:07:54.950 --> 02:07:56.350]
And guess what's number two

[02:07:56.350 --> 02:07:58.170]
Citizen Kane's the suck by the way

[02:07:58.170 --> 02:07:59.490]
Exactly with Orson Wells

[02:07:59.490 --> 02:08:00.490]
When he was really fat

[02:08:00.490 --> 02:08:02.430]
Number two the Godfather

[02:08:03.930 --> 02:08:05.010]
The Godfather

[02:08:05.010 --> 02:08:08.110]
I mean Citizen Kane couldn't wipe the Godfather's butt

[02:08:08.110 --> 02:08:09.070]
It leaves it good

[02:08:09.890 --> 02:08:10.890]
Take the can only

[02:08:10.890 --> 02:08:11.410]
Exactly

[02:08:12.030 --> 02:08:15.870]
Well I mean without the Citizen Kane knew about the mafia for Christ's taste

[02:08:16.590 --> 02:08:17.130]
Even

[02:08:17.130 --> 02:08:19.210]
Big shot

[02:08:19.210 --> 02:08:20.730]
Knows more about it

[02:08:20.730 --> 02:08:21.690]
Casablanca third

[02:08:21.690 --> 02:08:23.030]
Not didn't you see you wouldn't watch that

[02:08:23.630 --> 02:08:26.250]
I tried several times and I got pretty much

[02:08:26.250 --> 02:08:27.930]
Raging bull is number four

[02:08:27.930 --> 02:08:30.870]
We're talking about a bunch of Bolshevik good God

[02:08:30.870 --> 02:08:33.810]
Raging bull my ass that movie is so bad

[02:08:34.390 --> 02:08:35.570]
Singing in the rain

[02:08:35.570 --> 02:08:36.290]
Oh yeah

[02:08:36.910 --> 02:08:38.430]
With what was named Gene Kelly

[02:08:38.430 --> 02:08:39.070]
Wasn't he in that

[02:08:39.070 --> 02:08:40.870]
Yes, singing in the rain

[02:08:40.870 --> 02:08:42.670]
How would you know that's 1952

[02:08:43.270 --> 02:08:44.770]
Long before you were hatched

[02:08:44.770 --> 02:08:45.490]
Gone with a win

[02:08:45.490 --> 02:08:46.210]
Number six

[02:08:46.210 --> 02:08:47.150]
Should I read some of these

[02:08:47.150 --> 02:08:48.050]
Lawrence of Arabia

[02:08:48.050 --> 02:08:48.870]
Number seven

[02:08:49.790 --> 02:08:51.790]
That was that with that queen in Solor and Solivia

[02:08:52.610 --> 02:08:53.190]
Schindler's list

[02:08:53.190 --> 02:08:54.130]
Which I have in the other room

[02:08:54.130 --> 02:08:54.850]
And I still have a watch

[02:08:54.850 --> 02:08:55.370]
Because it's another

[02:08:55.370 --> 02:08:56.470]
June movie

[02:08:57.370 --> 02:08:58.250]
Of Vertigo

[02:08:58.250 --> 02:08:59.190]
Oh Vertigo is

[02:08:59.190 --> 02:09:00.590]
How can that be number nine

[02:09:00.590 --> 02:09:02.670]
It's certainly not the best Hitchcock movie of all time

[02:09:02.670 --> 02:09:03.450]
Like close

[02:09:03.450 --> 02:09:04.730]
Not even close

[02:09:04.730 --> 02:09:05.390]
Oh

[02:09:06.590 --> 02:09:07.590]
Wizard of odds

[02:09:08.190 --> 02:09:08.770]
City lights

[02:09:08.770 --> 02:09:09.750]
The searchers

[02:09:10.570 --> 02:09:11.390]
Star Wars

[02:09:11.390 --> 02:09:12.390]
Psycho 14

[02:09:12.390 --> 02:09:14.350]
How can Vertigo be nine and psycho 14

[02:09:14.350 --> 02:09:16.550]
Who made this list the point obviously a bunch of glam

[02:09:18.110 --> 02:09:18.590]
Wow

[02:09:18.590 --> 02:09:20.550]
Charshank Redemption is number 72

[02:09:21.390 --> 02:09:21.970]
First time on

[02:09:21.970 --> 02:09:25.070]
The general from 1927 came on for the first time on list

[02:09:25.070 --> 02:09:26.150]
And it's number 18

[02:09:26.150 --> 02:09:28.330]
The general must be a silent movie

[02:09:28.330 --> 02:09:31.130]
When you think I'm at 27

[02:09:31.130 --> 02:09:34.130]
One of the stomach and talking when he's like 1930 or 31

[02:09:34.130 --> 02:09:34.890]
They're boots

[02:09:34.890 --> 02:09:35.850]
They're a boat

[02:09:35.850 --> 02:09:38.210]
Right about the time we had the Frankenstein and

[02:09:38.210 --> 02:09:38.870]
Dracula

[02:09:41.010 --> 02:09:42.150]
What's their foe

[02:09:42.950 --> 02:09:43.390]
WQAM

[02:09:44.330 --> 02:09:46.330]
Where the action is

[02:09:50.610 --> 02:09:51.890]
Hey, this guy's the real

[02:09:51.890 --> 02:09:55.410]
And when I'm up in Boca Tiga slapping all the women with painted lips around the pool

[02:09:55.410 --> 02:09:57.210]
I listen to the new Rogers one or two

[02:09:57.910 --> 02:09:59.350]
I mean I don't know

[02:09:59.350 --> 02:10:01.430]
I just hear and balance one or two hours

[02:10:02.010 --> 02:10:02.390]
WQW

[02:10:03.790 --> 02:10:05.450]
This is our with the students

[02:10:05.450 --> 02:10:10.510]
A government watchdog group files an ethics complaint against Idaho Senator Larry Craig

[02:10:10.510 --> 02:10:14.710]
An undercover police officer said Craig made a sexual advance for him

[02:10:14.710 --> 02:10:18.190]
In a restroom at the Minneapolis St. Paul International Airport

[02:10:18.190 --> 02:10:19.410]
Craig now says

[02:10:19.410 --> 02:10:20.510]
Who wants to touch my monkey?

[02:10:20.810 --> 02:10:21.850]
Craig went on the offensive

[02:10:21.850 --> 02:10:26.590]
Denying involvement in a gay sex scandal involving Congressman and underage pages

[02:10:27.250 --> 02:10:29.270]
He's touching my special area

[02:10:29.270 --> 02:10:31.150]
That is a bad place to touch

[02:10:31.150 --> 02:10:32.670]
And they were touching each other

[02:10:32.670 --> 02:10:35.870]
In a statement he said, quote, they were misconstruing my actions

[02:10:35.870 --> 02:10:37.210]
Thanks for touching my penis

[02:10:37.210 --> 02:10:39.750]
Despite meeting guilty to this orderly conduct

[02:10:39.750 --> 02:10:41.690]
The Senator denies any wrongdoing

[02:10:41.690 --> 02:10:43.390]
They didn't even ask you to touch your winner

[02:10:43.390 --> 02:10:44.430]
He is offered it

[02:10:44.430 --> 02:10:46.370]
He already resigned a prominent role

[02:10:46.370 --> 02:10:48.550]
in the Mitt Romney for President campaign

[02:10:48.550 --> 02:10:50.030]
Take a walk pervert

[02:10:50.590 --> 02:10:52.790]
102 at 560 it's our gigantic one and two

[02:10:52.790 --> 02:10:54.630]
Are we are not going to make a thousand boats on a pool

[02:10:54.630 --> 02:10:57.490]
It's because Joel Feinberg he screwed up the show

[02:10:58.710 --> 02:11:00.530]
He threw us off our appointed grounds

[02:11:00.530 --> 02:11:02.070]
Didn't we? We only got 888?

[02:11:02.110 --> 02:11:02.890]
Probably by design

[02:11:03.790 --> 02:11:05.430]
Wouldn't surprise me he would do anything

[02:11:05.430 --> 02:11:06.210]
He never heard us

[02:11:06.830 --> 02:11:09.470]
That's what fat ass Johnny Joe Bell is going to be saying on Tuesday

[02:11:09.470 --> 02:11:11.030]
He would do anything to hurt us

[02:11:12.370 --> 02:11:14.010]
Still I just checked the my space

[02:11:14.010 --> 02:11:15.350]
Didn't do that one nothing

[02:11:16.470 --> 02:11:17.970]
It's like all the rest of the time

[02:11:17.970 --> 02:11:20.690]
When did the audience ever respond anything that I was talking about?

[02:11:20.830 --> 02:11:21.490]
Almost never

[02:11:22.510 --> 02:11:23.310]
Almost never

[02:11:23.310 --> 02:11:24.110]
Unless it was alien

[02:11:24.610 --> 02:11:26.410]
Oh yeah something like that

[02:11:26.410 --> 02:11:30.050]
I could read the rest of the top 100 movies of all time here

[02:11:30.050 --> 02:11:31.930]
That would kill some time because there's no calls on the board

[02:11:31.930 --> 02:11:32.690]
Oh there's one

[02:11:33.190 --> 02:11:34.250]
WDQA and hello

[02:11:34.250 --> 02:11:35.030]
Deal

[02:11:35.570 --> 02:11:36.010]
Yes

[02:11:36.010 --> 02:11:37.570]
I'm very fine the George

[02:11:37.570 --> 02:11:39.310]
I've heard what never heard of yet

[02:11:39.310 --> 02:11:40.550]
That's all right

[02:11:40.550 --> 02:11:42.850]
I wouldn't solve it never be hard

[02:11:42.850 --> 02:11:43.710]
Yeah right

[02:11:46.210 --> 02:11:49.230]
560505 60 pound 560 any Verizon singular wireless line

[02:11:49.230 --> 02:11:50.930]
Network is number 64

[02:11:52.150 --> 02:11:54.390]
Which of course belongs to anybody's top ten list

[02:11:54.390 --> 02:11:55.870]
I'm as much as hell

[02:11:55.870 --> 02:11:57.530]
I don't think it's anymore

[02:11:57.530 --> 02:11:57.830]
Oh

[02:12:00.330 --> 02:12:01.550]
There are some others on here

[02:12:01.550 --> 02:12:03.590]
Like a clockwork orange is number 70

[02:12:03.590 --> 02:12:05.150]
The 70 you know that movie

[02:12:05.150 --> 02:12:05.610]
Sad

[02:12:06.130 --> 02:12:07.350]
Isn't that pathetic tragic

[02:12:09.230 --> 02:12:12.270]
Here's the facts from Bob and Crossbrings who says as the saying goes

[02:12:12.710 --> 02:12:16.670]
I walk a mile for a camel so I'd easily switch my dial from QM to 790

[02:12:17.630 --> 02:12:20.430]
Hopefully this would be easier than the switch from my WDQA to 560

[02:12:20.430 --> 02:12:22.470]
Where you had to abide by six month non-compete

[02:12:22.470 --> 02:12:24.230]
Hopefully it would be just as good

[02:12:24.230 --> 02:12:27.290]
But I got paid off to go away for seven months wasn't six or was seven

[02:12:28.010 --> 02:12:29.930]
I got paid not to work for seven months

[02:12:30.910 --> 02:12:32.950]
Here's what it says a few things to consider

[02:12:32.950 --> 02:12:36.250]
If you're at any non-compete you should negotiate more vacation

[02:12:36.930 --> 02:12:39.250]
Perhaps in the summer you could only work Wednesdays

[02:12:39.250 --> 02:12:40.990]
You need to strongly to show

[02:12:42.090 --> 02:12:44.090]
Stronger promotion of the Anya Roger show

[02:12:44.090 --> 02:12:45.410]
Taking George's a must

[02:12:45.410 --> 02:12:47.770]
Get the words back get the sounds back

[02:12:48.610 --> 02:12:53.030]
And maybe you could do some hockey talk. Oh, yeah, that would do a tank. Tunky-tong

[02:12:53.850 --> 02:12:56.590]
Lastly what the F was clear about thinking over the last few years

[02:12:56.590 --> 02:12:58.790]
I listen to the Joe Roe show on 790 now

[02:12:58.790 --> 02:13:04.110]
Clara gets Joe back and immediately changes and destroys the equity of the name of the Joe Roe show

[02:13:05.430 --> 02:13:09.030]
Joe did a fine job as a single but Clara changes the name and Jason

[02:13:09.030 --> 02:13:12.430]
Why is it necessary for a two-man show? That's a good question for just three hours

[02:13:12.970 --> 02:13:17.150]
You need to run for the hell so more quickly than the NR show in 790 since Bob and Crossbrings

[02:13:17.150 --> 02:13:21.890]
I'm moving quickly although the audience seems a non-plussed unimpressed. I guess they're not taking it seriously

[02:13:22.810 --> 02:13:26.990]
Maybe they think that was a phony a stunt call by you know all our calls are set up

[02:13:27.410 --> 02:13:29.950]
I pay people to make these deals now they do that over there

[02:13:31.210 --> 02:13:33.730]
2001 is number 15 great dialogue

[02:13:34.670 --> 02:13:39.550]
Now this list is so bogus. It's kind of like a joebell. It's boi and clearance bogus

[02:13:41.590 --> 02:13:42.390]
WDQYN hello

[02:13:43.350 --> 02:13:44.150]
Neil yes

[02:13:45.110 --> 02:13:46.710]
Yeah, I have a fiery fort

[02:13:48.510 --> 02:13:49.190]
Yeah

[02:13:50.370 --> 02:13:57.210]
This is uh uh third guy named Tom he was singing at a karaoke bar

Well it's a good thing that I'm starting to segue this hour into all these stories

[02:14:52.350 --> 02:14:55.290]
898 votes on the poll that's another good job there by joebell

[02:14:55.290 --> 02:14:59.210]
Hell of a fantastic job him and Norma Kent working together glammed in hand

[02:14:59.210 --> 02:15:02.670]
Because you know joe he's got a PI he's got a private investigator

[02:15:02.670 --> 02:15:05.670]
And he's gonna go out and get these four or five guys around him all up

[02:15:05.670 --> 02:15:07.670]
He's gonna do you know he's gonna do squad

[02:15:10.310 --> 02:15:13.530]
And when he squats man then I'd head for the hills

[02:15:14.550 --> 02:15:17.050]
Because that aroma is gonna put you into a comment

[02:15:17.790 --> 02:15:18.190]
Yeah

[02:15:18.190 --> 02:15:18.850]
Yeah

[02:15:19.870 --> 02:15:22.130]
898 and a pool I don't think we can make the thousand now

[02:15:22.130 --> 02:15:24.450]
What did we just say for 950 Chris this is very disappointing

[02:15:24.450 --> 02:15:27.370]
I think we had the hunt the 1000 licked earlier

[02:15:27.370 --> 02:15:28.730]
I will go for 950 today

[02:15:28.730 --> 02:15:29.430]
We were licking it

[02:15:29.970 --> 02:15:33.210]
And now we got just 902 we 98 votes in 53 minutes

[02:15:33.210 --> 02:15:35.630]
What's the ratio one Eric or the Ericsson thing

[02:15:36.710 --> 02:15:40.130]
We need 1.9 a minute to get to a thousand that's not gonna happen

[02:15:41.210 --> 02:15:46.550]
Well that's like two a minute I forget what we usually what what can we handle can we handle two a minute

[02:15:47.190 --> 02:15:49.590]
Yeah, why not I could handle two appear

[02:15:50.210 --> 02:15:54.370]
And after a B 52 bomber mistakenly loaded with five nuclear warheads through from minor

[02:15:54.370 --> 02:15:58.210]
Air Force base north Dakota to barks the other force base lose you in on august 30

[02:15:59.230 --> 02:16:02.810]
Resulting an Air Force wide investigation according to three officers where I's not to be identified

[02:16:02.810 --> 02:16:04.830]
Because they were authorized to discuss the incident

[02:16:05.870 --> 02:16:11.770]
The B 52 was loaded with advanced cruise missiles part of an offensive firm in effort to decommission 400 of the ACMs

[02:16:11.770 --> 02:16:15.690]
But the nuclear warhead should have been removed at mine out before being transferred to barkstale

[02:16:15.690 --> 02:16:19.770]
Missiles were mounted on the pylons of the bombers wing well there you go

[02:16:22.230 --> 02:16:25.410]
Just a minor mistake oops oops

[02:16:27.470 --> 02:16:29.670]

Sofford a business journal and levenson jurors present the diamond awards on September 6th which sounds like yesterday to me or today

[02:16:45.350 --> 02:16:52.750]
The diamond awards give the community an opportunity to honor Broward County CEOs whose exceptional leadership has helped to set standards in the corporate community

[02:16:53.590 --> 02:16:55.670]

When you think you when you think it would be like Barry jackass with right to think because on Friday morning

[02:17:31.610 --> 02:17:34.010]
He usually writes this thing in the herald

[02:17:34.010 --> 02:17:41.050]
Yeah, we're right a blurb in the paper about how Joel Fimer called new rogers on the year on QAM live and offered him a job to come over and do mid days on the ticket

[02:17:42.230 --> 02:17:47.930]

[02:19:52.690 --> 02:19:53.130]
rectum

I never have been gay

[02:20:06.290 --> 02:20:12.410]
Let's make one thing perfectly clear first you move your foot see from the heel to the toe

[02:20:13.090 --> 02:20:16.230]
Make the topping sound as you move it to and throw

[02:20:16.850 --> 02:20:23.690]
Point it towards the stall and someone you don't know and then you tap around and tap around like more's cold

[02:20:24.450 --> 02:20:27.710]
Run your fingers all along the bottom of the stall

[02:20:27.710 --> 02:20:34.970]
To signal that you're ready for some pilot chin ball when he signals back he wants to take all your sack

[02:20:35.690 --> 02:20:38.790]
Right that's what's called the baggity top

[02:20:39.450 --> 02:20:46.650]
To the cold around to find a glory hole if none can be found squirm down by the hole

[02:20:46.650 --> 02:20:53.990]
Push your head through to the other side and ask of you and he want to see I to fly

[02:20:53.990 --> 02:20:57.890]
You're in the public place so make it fast

[02:20:57.890 --> 02:21:04.070]
At least until you both have a blast then your genuine blitz and

[02:21:04.070 --> 02:21:05.330]
Hold up your pants

[02:21:06.190 --> 02:21:09.010]
That's what's called the baggity top

[02:21:09.610 --> 02:21:12.970]
Unless the other guy shows you his badge

[02:21:15.610 --> 02:21:20.170]
You're looking for the glory hole 117 at 560 WDQ. I'm happy Thursday to you

[02:21:20.170 --> 02:21:25.790]

[02:21:26.570 --> 02:21:31.890]

Mm back when we hit an audience back when we hit like salespeople are really you know communicated with us beside muff

[02:21:39.990 --> 02:21:45.790]
Here's an article from raw story. It says move over Larry Craig the most feared man on Capitol Hill promises

[02:21:45.790 --> 02:21:50.310]
He's gonna release the names of a few more closeted Republicans in a month to come all right

[02:21:51.230 --> 02:21:57.630]
In a Tuesday profile of Washington outing blogger Mike Rogers by Jose Antonio Vargas the 43-year-old actor

[02:21:57.630 --> 02:22:02.350]
This is he plans to release the names of few more closeted congress members on his blog blog active

[02:22:02.890 --> 02:22:10.010]
The one-time fundraiser out of Larry Craig on his blog last October following his post the Idaho statesman dispatched to report this story

[02:22:10.010 --> 02:22:16.510]
A piece that remained canned until revelations that Craig was arrested for loon conduct in that Minneapolis airport bathroom in August

[02:22:17.350 --> 02:22:24.210]
Larry Craig wasn't the first in my list Roger told the post and the Idaho Senator announces reservations some that Saturday won't be the last

[02:22:25.030 --> 02:22:29.790]
His intention to resign that is he's intending or wasn't ending but maybe he intends to yeah

[02:22:30.670 --> 02:22:35.090]
Years before outing game members of Congress became fashionable Rogers was hot on the trail

[02:22:35.750 --> 02:22:41.770]
Rosteray joined Rogers and reporting on closeted game members of Congress and senior officials who preached an anti-gay agenda in public

[02:22:41.770 --> 02:22:43.770]
They lived another life in private private

[02:22:44.530 --> 02:22:48.710]
In 2004 following up on a blog post rosteray joined Rogers and reporting on

[02:22:48.710 --> 02:22:54.770]
California Republican David drier who according to associates and former challenger lived with his male chief of staff

[02:22:55.450 --> 02:23:00.830]
Follow-up stories further revealed the drier paid his chief of staff from both his committee and office funds at a higher rate than

[02:23:00.830 --> 02:23:02.510]
similar life experience aids

[02:23:03.050 --> 02:23:06.350]
The report which threw attention from the LA Daily News and Hustler

[02:23:06.350 --> 02:23:13.790]
Fairly draw attention from the mainstream press at the time and editor from the LA Times declared the piece an on story and a conversation with Ross story in this reporter

[02:23:14.910 --> 02:23:22.310]
The Washington Post omitted Rogers work on drier drier has vehemently denied allegations of his homosexuality to which I would say you ferry

[02:23:22.310 --> 02:23:28.190]
After being handpicked by Ristwell House majority leader Tom Delay as his temporary successor drier mysteriously

[02:23:28.190 --> 02:23:33.630]
Vanished from the shortlist after a piece on Ross story revealing early reports that he previously lived with his chief of staff

[02:23:33.630 --> 02:23:40.650]
The post also left out represented Jim McCruery Republican of Louisiana who Rogers blogged about in October 2004

[02:23:41.290 --> 02:23:49.950]
In addition the article makes no mention of the outing of former Republican National Committee chairman Ken Melman an architect of the Bush victory in 2000 or the former CEO and director of the

[02:23:49.950 --> 02:23:52.270]
Ministerate for the Republican National Committee jade banning

[02:23:53.130 --> 02:23:54.770]
This site reported on both

[02:23:54.770 --> 02:23:59.350]
Melman denied allegations of his homosexuality banning said co-workers knew that he was gay

[02:24:00.530 --> 02:24:06.530]
Gay two months before Rogers had targeted the then Virginia Congressman Ed Schrock after a source supplied audio

[02:24:06.530 --> 02:24:09.230]
recordings of Schrock calling a gay phone sex line

[02:24:09.810 --> 02:24:14.050]
Honor recording Schrock described what type of man he was looking for including his endowment

[02:24:14.670 --> 02:24:20.090]
Uh, hi, I weigh 200 pounds. I'm six four blonde hair very muscular very buffed up very 10

[02:24:20.090 --> 02:24:24.630]
I just like to get together a guy from time to time just to play the first while representative said

[02:24:24.630 --> 02:24:27.910]
I'd like him to be in very good shape flat stomach good chest good arms

[02:24:27.910 --> 02:24:32.130]
Well hung cut just get naked play and see what happens nothing really heavy duty

[02:24:32.130 --> 02:24:37.270]
But just fun time go down on him he can go down on me and just take it from there. Hope to hear from you by

[02:24:39.070 --> 02:24:44.310]
Roger said he targeted truck because of his voting record on gay rights and a comedy made the Virginia pilot in 2000

[02:24:44.310 --> 02:24:48.390]
About gays in the military you're in the showers with them you're in the bunk room with them

[02:24:48.390 --> 02:24:52.890]
You're in the state roots with them state rooms with them. He said Schrock bowed out of his reelection race

[02:24:53.430 --> 02:24:57.590]
Rogers also blogged about ex-congressman Mark Foley months before instant message of him

[02:24:57.590 --> 02:25:03.070]
So seeing congressional pages surfaced on the web the Florida Republican devoted various times against gay rights

[02:25:03.070 --> 02:25:08.870]
I write about closeted people whose records are anti gay or I just told the post if you're a closeted

[02:25:08.870 --> 02:25:13.550]
Democrat or Republicanian don't bash gays or vote against gay rights to gain political points. I won't out you

[02:25:15.090 --> 02:25:16.750]
According to Vargas's post profile

[02:25:16.750 --> 02:25:20.650]
Rogers came out in his early 20s to spend the bulk of his life working for gay organizations

[02:25:20.650 --> 02:25:25.170]
And it goes on but a bit bit of a bit about doesn't say how hung he is or whatever

[02:25:26.590 --> 02:25:30.630]
920 votes on the pool boy really sad. I think Joel. I don't know. He I think he put a hex

[02:25:31.070 --> 02:25:33.110]
Is it possible to do that like over the phone?

[02:25:33.730 --> 02:25:34.290]
Why not

[02:25:35.450 --> 02:25:42.030]
Call up father Miran and see if he can conduct an exorcism on the phone not just for him, but I think for obvious other reasons as well

[02:25:42.930 --> 02:25:45.130]
Maybe that's what our phone needs a good exorcism

[02:25:46.410 --> 02:25:49.150]

[02:26:13.770 --> 02:26:17.810]

[02:26:32.370 --> 02:26:32.770]
Oh

[02:26:34.130 --> 02:26:40.090]
Well, that seems to be making a comeback this time I work. Do you notice in the book? I hope you read notice yeah, I did

[02:26:40.710 --> 02:26:41.950]
Good we dumped it

[02:26:42.770 --> 02:26:44.170]
No, no, oh yes

[02:26:44.170 --> 02:26:44.310]
Yes

[02:26:46.170 --> 02:26:47.110]
That's the one that goes

[02:26:51.750 --> 02:26:59.490]
We don't want to play the whole thing bits of ass. That's where we got oh boy

[02:27:00.650 --> 02:27:04.270]
We're under 21 votes is all we got boy. This is really a sad state of affairs

[02:27:04.810 --> 02:27:10.970]
Maybe it's because they think I'm a turn code you know if we if we turn tail and got their line who who the audience the audience

[02:27:10.970 --> 02:27:16.390]
Oh, yeah, they're so loyal to the station they would never listen to another station for any reason

[02:27:16.390 --> 02:27:20.710]
You're not getting a lot of calls about your rose coming back to town to the station. Well when they hear it with

[02:27:20.710 --> 02:27:24.830]
Keep Jackson when the show starts and they hear him maybe we'll get some well one second to start

[02:27:24.830 --> 02:27:28.250]
I don't know any spots in our right. We have viewers now sound they're doing live spots

[02:27:29.270 --> 02:27:33.050]

[02:27:46.010 --> 02:27:47.710]

Hello

[02:28:03.830 --> 02:28:04.690]
now to his class.

[02:28:05.750 --> 02:28:06.330]
WDQAN, hello.

[02:28:08.690 --> 02:28:09.050]
QAN.

[02:28:10.850 --> 02:28:11.670]
I punched it.

[02:28:11.750 --> 02:28:12.690]
That's a bad sign there.

[02:28:12.770 --> 02:28:13.150]
Oh, there it went.

[02:28:13.270 --> 02:28:13.830]
QAN, hello.

[02:28:14.450 --> 02:28:15.390]
Oh, my God, you picked right up.

[02:28:15.770 --> 02:28:15.970]
Yeah.

[02:28:17.110 --> 02:28:18.030]
I don't remember.

[02:28:18.510 --> 02:28:19.310]
I missed it so much.

[02:28:19.650 --> 02:28:20.490]
The old Panther games.

[02:28:20.690 --> 02:28:23.850]
But do you remember when you were talking about Jody Hall all the time and his wife called

[02:28:23.850 --> 02:28:27.550]
in and you just, you must have turned red like a beat, I swear.

[02:28:27.950 --> 02:28:28.510]
No, I did not.

[02:28:29.730 --> 02:28:30.970]
Jody Hall's wife loved me.

[02:28:31.050 --> 02:28:31.610]
What are you talking about?

[02:28:31.610 --> 02:28:31.930]
I know.

[02:28:32.230 --> 02:28:33.630]
She came to see me talking again.

[02:28:33.630 --> 02:28:34.590]
So why did I turn red?

[02:28:34.790 --> 02:28:35.870]
Because I thought her husband was hot.

[02:28:36.090 --> 02:28:36.950]
So what about it?

[02:28:37.170 --> 02:28:39.050]
He loved me too as a matter of fact.

[02:28:39.870 --> 02:28:41.410]
Oh, man, I missed those guys so much.

[02:28:41.630 --> 02:28:42.170]
Yeah, well good.

[02:28:42.390 --> 02:28:43.610]
Keep living in the past, pal.

[02:28:43.670 --> 02:28:44.530]
I keep living in the past.

[02:28:44.690 --> 02:28:45.850]
I missed those guys so much.

[02:28:45.990 --> 02:28:49.390]
Stoey bars and Jody Hall and Mike Huff and Billy Lindsay.

[02:28:51.950 --> 02:28:53.390]
We love the Panthers.

[02:28:53.750 --> 02:28:54.850]
Are they still in the league?

[02:28:55.790 --> 02:28:57.350]
Let's get some hockey talk going.

[02:28:57.390 --> 02:28:58.290]
Edelho crank it up.

[02:28:58.410 --> 02:29:01.070]
In fact, that's going to be my deal with Joel Feinberg because I'm going to do a hockey

[02:29:01.070 --> 02:29:01.390]
show.

[02:29:01.390 --> 02:29:03.570]
First goal for the first time in this series.

[02:29:03.830 --> 02:29:06.290]
Are they a deep, he is just by let's go.

[02:29:06.330 --> 02:29:09.510]
Oh, there's that constipated Chris Cuffford from the Affirmary CVC.

[02:29:09.790 --> 02:29:12.170]
The point is that the missing can back to the blue line.

[02:29:12.750 --> 02:29:13.690]
Download a shark.

[02:29:13.930 --> 02:29:16.410]
The series has blocked in front of the Nathana Rather.

[02:29:16.570 --> 02:29:16.950]
That's great.

[02:29:17.110 --> 02:29:18.510]
You're there by Conver Lake.

[02:29:18.750 --> 02:29:20.390]
Yeah, let's get the Leafs to the games on here.

[02:29:20.470 --> 02:29:22.750]
Let's assemble cast Leafs TV to Elgis over the top.

[02:29:24.030 --> 02:29:28.110]
5 6 7 0 5 60, pound 5 60 in the Verizon and Singular wireless line.

[02:29:28.110 --> 02:29:32.830]
So Joel Feinberg and Casey Tune in late, you must say very, it was one of the most amazing

[02:29:32.830 --> 02:29:33.930]
moments in radio history.

[02:29:34.350 --> 02:29:35.710]
That's, don't you think so?

[02:29:36.530 --> 02:29:37.250]
It's the first.

[02:29:37.470 --> 02:29:39.990]
I've got to say, been in the business the long time now and I've never heard of it.

[02:29:40.110 --> 02:29:41.030]
And you've been a hundred bit.

[02:29:42.650 --> 02:29:45.970]
The general manager from the competition across the street calls in.

[02:29:46.070 --> 02:29:47.070]
We're doing screenless, of course.

[02:29:47.390 --> 02:29:50.470]
I pick it up and he claims it's Joel Feinberg and then come to find out it was him.

[02:29:51.050 --> 02:29:54.110]
He sounded a little bit too lively to be the guy spoke to a couple of weeks ago when he

[02:29:54.110 --> 02:29:54.570]
was here in town.

[02:29:55.010 --> 02:29:56.110]
Well, maybe that was his radio voice.

[02:29:56.610 --> 02:29:57.670]
Maybe that was it.

[02:29:58.770 --> 02:30:00.510]
And it's come to find out that it was him.

[02:30:01.370 --> 02:30:02.270]
And now he's sending messages.

[02:30:02.650 --> 02:30:04.530]
He's text messaging with George back and forth.

[02:30:04.690 --> 02:30:08.710]
But at first he said I was in A-hole and then he said he's going to call on Monday and

[02:30:08.710 --> 02:30:09.810]
make the deal on the year.

[02:30:09.850 --> 02:30:10.770]
But it's nothing personal.

[02:30:10.910 --> 02:30:12.990]
I mean, he probably does still think that but nevertheless.

[02:30:13.670 --> 02:30:16.890]
Well, maybe I am in A-hole, but I brought the money making A-hole.

[02:30:16.990 --> 02:30:19.370]
He used to draw a big audience when I was on a real radio studio.

[02:30:19.470 --> 02:30:20.370]
You're allowed to do a radio show.

[02:30:20.770 --> 02:30:20.970]
Yeah.

[02:30:21.450 --> 02:30:22.750]
And when anybody knows that we're on.

[02:30:24.330 --> 02:30:26.150]
I mean, well, what are these people thinking?

[02:30:26.370 --> 02:30:27.850]
I know that thinking is probably the wrong word.

[02:30:27.950 --> 02:30:28.670]
But what are they thinking?

[02:30:28.710 --> 02:30:29.810]
What are these people here in this building?

[02:30:29.910 --> 02:30:30.970]
Yes, the people in that building.

[02:30:31.150 --> 02:30:32.290]
What do they think they're going to do?

[02:30:32.290 --> 02:30:33.010]
What do you think they're going to do?

[02:30:33.130 --> 02:30:34.150]
How do you think the dolphins are going to do?

[02:30:34.350 --> 02:30:34.690]
Oh, my God.

[02:30:34.690 --> 02:30:35.630]
I think the gate is going to do the good stuff.

[02:30:35.870 --> 02:30:35.950]
Oh, yeah.

[02:30:36.170 --> 02:30:37.550]
That really turned us around, baby.

[02:30:37.890 --> 02:30:38.390]
How back home.

[02:30:38.670 --> 02:30:38.830]
Yeah.

[02:30:39.270 --> 02:30:40.390]
When we got to dolphin broadcast.

[02:30:40.810 --> 02:30:44.210]
And of course, we got Jimmy Cifilis doing the games because the dolphin management, they

[02:30:44.210 --> 02:30:45.790]
think that he's a play-by-play guy.

[02:30:45.990 --> 02:30:46.170]
Wow.

[02:30:47.950 --> 02:30:48.450]
WDQYM, hello.

[02:30:49.230 --> 02:30:50.450]
Leo, I'm in the next stall.

[02:30:50.610 --> 02:30:51.930]
If I tap myself, what do you tell me?

[02:30:52.630 --> 02:30:53.850]
I tap this.

[02:30:54.050 --> 02:30:54.270]
Yeah.

[02:30:55.430 --> 02:30:57.150]
Oh, wait, that's not the right one.

[02:30:57.450 --> 02:30:59.350]
Ha, ha, ha.

[02:30:59.630 --> 02:31:00.450]
That's the right one.

[02:31:00.490 --> 02:31:01.250]
That's the right one.

[02:31:01.250 --> 02:31:01.850]
That's the right one you can't play.

[02:31:02.750 --> 02:31:03.150]
Wonderful.

[02:31:05.190 --> 02:31:06.890]
WDQYM, that's my 60th.

[02:31:06.890 --> 02:31:07.070]
Oh.

[02:31:08.090 --> 02:31:09.090]
Take it, baby.

[02:31:14.950 --> 02:31:17.130]
I can't take too much butter.

[02:31:18.130 --> 02:31:20.270]
It shoots right out my ass.

[02:31:20.930 --> 02:31:23.210]
Bed, fur, and aparinga.

[02:31:24.250 --> 02:31:26.010]
Blooming to the can.

[02:31:26.190 --> 02:31:29.350]
Now, smell my dad's cake for Santa Clara.

[02:31:29.930 --> 02:31:32.150]
And cold water's free, yeah.

[02:31:32.870 --> 02:31:35.190]
We're going to watch fun in Christmas.

[02:31:36.450 --> 02:31:38.210]
Then I get so far.

[02:31:38.630 --> 02:31:38.930]
Yeah.

[02:31:39.250 --> 02:31:41.370]
I can't take too much butter.

[02:31:41.970 --> 02:31:44.330]
I can't take it at all.

[02:31:45.330 --> 02:31:47.490]
I ask for it from all extra.

[02:31:47.890 --> 02:31:50.410]
And especially sorbet's all.

[02:31:50.510 --> 02:31:53.930]
I know, I feed so much in a quick shot.

[02:31:54.670 --> 02:31:56.550]
I want to know the world of my dad.

[02:31:57.150 --> 02:32:02.950]
He's got a lot of love to eat, but I just can't say such a thing.

[02:32:03.590 --> 02:32:05.670]
I can't take too much butter.

[02:32:06.390 --> 02:32:08.730]
It goes through me too fast.

[02:32:09.430 --> 02:32:11.910]
And three times I feed it.

[02:32:12.570 --> 02:32:14.770]
I have to change my pants.

[02:32:15.670 --> 02:32:17.130]
I can't take too much butter.

[02:32:17.130 --> 02:32:19.390]
OK, 133, 27.25, 60.

[02:32:19.610 --> 02:32:22.490]
We're not going to make 1,000 votes on a poll today, not even close.

[02:32:22.890 --> 02:32:23.370]
Thanks, Joel.

[02:32:23.730 --> 02:32:24.750]
You sandbagged us.

[02:32:24.790 --> 02:32:25.710]
I don't know how he did it.

[02:32:26.310 --> 02:32:26.630]
I don't know.

[02:32:26.850 --> 02:32:28.630]
Teleport was on fire.

[02:32:29.010 --> 02:32:29.830]
And he extinguished it.

[02:32:30.150 --> 02:32:30.870]
We got 9.30.

[02:32:30.990 --> 02:32:32.370]
We need 70 votes in 27.

[02:32:32.590 --> 02:32:33.510]
Not even possible.

[02:32:35.630 --> 02:32:36.010]
Impossibly.

[02:32:36.310 --> 02:32:37.170]
So what about 9.50?

[02:32:37.310 --> 02:32:38.010]
How does that sound, Chris?

[02:32:38.250 --> 02:32:38.750]
Sounds good to me.

[02:32:39.110 --> 02:32:41.030]
Chris says he'll settle for 9.50 an hour.

[02:32:41.910 --> 02:32:42.810]
Hey, it's not his number.

[02:32:43.010 --> 02:32:43.190]
He has a good period.

[02:32:44.390 --> 02:32:48.250]
The senior pastor of a Tulsa Baptist Church was arrested outside of Northwest Oklahoma

[02:32:48.250 --> 02:32:53.070]
City Hotel after allegedly propositioning undercover officer police said, oh, no.

[02:32:53.450 --> 02:32:54.870]
Sounds very gay to me.

[02:32:55.910 --> 02:33:00.770]
Lonnie Way Latham, 59th Senior Pastor at South Tulsa Baptist Church, was arrested

[02:33:00.770 --> 02:33:03.650]
to his in a complaint of offering to engage in an act of lootness.

[02:33:05.910 --> 02:33:07.910]
He was released on $500.00 there yesterday.

[02:33:07.910 --> 02:33:11.890]
Officers working in the area of Northwest 39th Avenue and Pennsylvania have no

[02:33:11.890 --> 02:33:13.190]
for receiving several complaints.

[02:33:13.630 --> 02:33:13.950]
Complaints.

[02:33:14.350 --> 02:33:14.650]
Complaints.

[02:33:15.190 --> 02:33:18.710]
A big apartment that men were, I started sounding like Lenny Martezza for a second.

[02:33:19.870 --> 02:33:24.390]
The men were flagging down pastors by propositioning them asking if he could perform oral sex

[02:33:24.390 --> 02:33:24.850]
on them.

[02:33:25.550 --> 02:33:29.550]
About 9.45 p.m. the Plain closed officer was driving an unmarked car and investing in

[02:33:29.550 --> 02:33:31.670]
the complaints with a car began following the officer's car.

[02:33:32.110 --> 02:33:37.890]
Both cars then pulled into a parking lot on the southeast corner of Northwest 39th and

[02:33:37.890 --> 02:33:38.890]
pulled in their cover officer.

[02:33:39.030 --> 02:33:42.610]
He had a hotel room at a nearby motel and asked the officer to go back to his room with

[02:33:42.610 --> 02:33:43.450]
him for oral sex.

[02:33:43.710 --> 02:33:44.170]
Backer said.

[02:33:45.570 --> 02:33:48.530]
Latham was arrested a short time later in the parking lot of the Habana Inn.

[02:33:48.930 --> 02:33:49.750]
His car was impounded.

[02:33:49.950 --> 02:33:53.850]
A conviction on offering to engage in lootness charge if one is filed against him carries

[02:33:53.850 --> 02:33:56.430]
apparently up to a year in jail and or a $2,500.

[02:33:59.750 --> 02:34:03.630]
Latham is one of four executive members of the National Southern Baptist General Convention

[02:34:03.630 --> 02:34:04.190]
from Oklahoma.

[02:34:04.650 --> 02:34:05.190]
How do you like that?

[02:34:05.190 --> 02:34:09.190]
Heidi Wilbur, and spokeswoman for the Baptist General Convention of Oklahoma, said in

[02:34:09.190 --> 02:34:12.790]
the statement the group is deeply grieved by his arrest, our first concern is for his

[02:34:12.790 --> 02:34:16.570]
church and family, she said, as Christians we reach out to those who are hurt.

[02:34:17.090 --> 02:34:17.370]
Right.

[02:34:17.990 --> 02:34:18.550]
He's hurting.

[02:34:19.550 --> 02:34:23.950]
In 2004, Latham spoke out against the statewide measure that established the Oklahoma Lottery.

[02:34:24.390 --> 02:34:28.590]
He also supported the Southern Baptist Convention's policy that urges its members to be friend

[02:34:28.590 --> 02:34:31.990]
gays and lesbians and convince them that they can become heterosexual.

[02:34:33.390 --> 02:34:33.870]
Right.

[02:34:34.550 --> 02:34:35.070]
Like that.

[02:34:35.150 --> 02:34:35.450]
That's right.

[02:34:35.570 --> 02:34:38.950]
Wave that magic, uh, that's how they got to work in the first place.

[02:34:39.410 --> 02:34:40.530]
They waved the magic thing.

[02:34:43.030 --> 02:34:46.330]
Why 670560, pound 560 on the Verizon Singular Wireless Line?

[02:34:46.530 --> 02:34:47.430]
Here were St.

[02:34:47.550 --> 02:34:51.650]
His moments ago that we thought one of the most revolutionary events in radio history

[02:34:51.650 --> 02:34:53.490]
happened and the phone is his debt is the door and ill.

[02:34:53.750 --> 02:34:54.450]
And so is the poll.

[02:34:54.810 --> 02:34:56.490]
934 is all we got.

[02:34:57.250 --> 02:34:59.030]
They got still gots and look at what we got.

[02:35:00.170 --> 02:35:01.050]
An empty phone.

[02:35:01.050 --> 02:35:06.170]
I think I'm going to start spinning wax.

[02:35:06.790 --> 02:35:07.270]
Do it.

[02:35:08.090 --> 02:35:09.570]
I think that's the only solution.

[02:35:11.530 --> 02:35:16.350]
Why am I stupid enough to think that going back to the cause that anything would change?

[02:35:16.630 --> 02:35:17.390]
Why would I think so?

[02:35:17.590 --> 02:35:18.270]
I think all you know you.

[02:35:18.350 --> 02:35:19.850]
After a whole year, half of the year is coming.

[02:35:19.970 --> 02:35:19.970]

[02:35:20.050 --> 02:35:22.750]
Some of these people suddenly have anything to say about anything.

[02:35:26.590 --> 02:35:28.130]
Am I a crazy person or what?

[02:35:28.170 --> 02:35:28.430]
Well, yeah.

[02:35:28.570 --> 02:35:28.970]
Yeah.

[02:35:28.970 --> 02:35:29.690]
And an A-hole.

[02:35:30.270 --> 02:35:31.050]
Oh, I forgot.

[02:35:31.170 --> 02:35:31.670]
Thanks, Joel.

[02:35:31.990 --> 02:35:33.530]
And back at you by the way.

[02:35:33.970 --> 02:35:34.870]
WDQ AM Hello.

[02:35:35.550 --> 02:35:38.430]
Jim DeFeedy has more WDQ AM Hello.

[02:35:39.030 --> 02:35:41.810]
And this is Chuck Meyer and Gale by Napoleon Complex.

[02:35:45.350 --> 02:35:45.830]
560756.

[02:35:45.830 --> 02:35:46.310]
Oh, the red.

[02:35:47.590 --> 02:35:47.870]
Do you know?

[02:35:50.250 --> 02:35:53.150]
5607560, pound 560 on the Verizon Singular Wireless Line.

[02:35:53.470 --> 02:35:55.290]
Pretty slow here on the poll on the phone.

[02:35:55.290 --> 02:35:57.230]
I think he drove him off.

[02:36:00.130 --> 02:36:01.430]
W.C.Y.M. Hello.

[02:36:02.110 --> 02:36:03.190]
Hello, Neil Howe.

[02:36:03.450 --> 02:36:04.250]
Okay, sir.

[02:36:04.930 --> 02:36:08.730]
I have to say, between last Thursday and today,

[02:36:09.350 --> 02:36:11.310]
with Rick Shaw and Joe Flimberg,

[02:36:11.890 --> 02:36:13.850]
at first I thought it was a prank.

[02:36:14.390 --> 02:36:16.910]
So in my car, and then when George said,

[02:36:17.550 --> 02:36:19.570]
you know, he just called back and called me whatever.

[02:36:21.030 --> 02:36:24.710]
I thought, you know, everybody should tune in.

[02:36:24.710 --> 02:36:26.070]
10 or 5 on Monday.

[02:36:26.430 --> 02:36:26.930]
That's correct.

[02:36:27.230 --> 02:36:28.850]
They won't, they won't, because they're not said,

[02:36:28.850 --> 02:36:30.030]
they're not said by an end of this.

[02:36:30.170 --> 02:36:30.910]
They just don't get it.

[02:36:31.350 --> 02:36:33.790]
No, I mean, I believe George, when he said,

[02:36:33.870 --> 02:36:37.110]
no, he's factoring, he texted me this stuff and...

[02:36:37.110 --> 02:36:37.630]
That is correct.

[02:36:38.610 --> 02:36:40.490]
Well, there's fabulous radios.

[02:36:40.650 --> 02:36:41.450]
Thank you very much.

[02:36:41.650 --> 02:36:42.930]
Okay, you're welcome, North to charge.

[02:36:43.290 --> 02:36:45.030]
Well, there are some of you that's getting into it a little bit.

[02:36:45.110 --> 02:36:47.210]
Anything sport, this is really unusual and weird and strange

[02:36:47.210 --> 02:36:49.890]
and pretty bizarre and revolutionary in Yadi-Adiah.

[02:36:50.030 --> 02:36:51.210]
And as nothing to do with the ball games,

[02:36:51.390 --> 02:36:52.150]
don't know any scores.

[02:36:52.150 --> 02:36:54.930]
We do have some numbers, like 935 on the pole,

[02:36:54.930 --> 02:36:55.910]
which is very, very weak.

[02:36:56.150 --> 02:36:58.070]
But we'll make that 950 though, and Crystal feel better.

[02:36:58.410 --> 02:36:59.590]
He'll feel like a real man.

[02:37:01.050 --> 02:37:01.610]
WQA-M.

[02:37:01.990 --> 02:37:02.190]
Hello.

[02:37:02.290 --> 02:37:03.970]
I'd like to give a shout out to my peeps.

[02:37:04.970 --> 02:37:05.710]
WQA-M. Hello.

[02:37:06.690 --> 02:37:07.030]
Hey, guys.

[02:37:07.530 --> 02:37:07.870]
Yes, sir.

[02:37:08.050 --> 02:37:08.670]
Happy Thursday, sir.

[02:37:08.670 --> 02:37:09.410]
You're nearly back to you.

[02:37:09.670 --> 02:37:10.190]
How's it going today?

[02:37:10.670 --> 02:37:11.730]
No, it's the usual.

[02:37:12.530 --> 02:37:13.290]
Quick question.

[02:37:13.510 --> 02:37:16.770]
Have you heard about that scandal with Howard K and the other guy?

[02:37:18.010 --> 02:37:18.810]
Larry Burkett.

[02:37:18.870 --> 02:37:21.230]
Yeah, Larry Burkett and Jerkett and whatever.

[02:37:21.670 --> 02:37:22.430]
What do you think?

[02:37:22.570 --> 02:37:24.910]
I mean, you've got the eye like, what do I, I don't care.

[02:37:25.170 --> 02:37:26.450]
I don't know what I couldn't care less.

[02:37:26.450 --> 02:37:26.990]
What do I mean?

[02:37:27.110 --> 02:37:27.790]
What do I think?

[02:37:28.230 --> 02:37:29.750]
Well, we're gonna, are we gonna revisit

[02:37:29.750 --> 02:37:32.130]
Ann and Nicole and all the associated idiots with it?

[02:37:32.250 --> 02:37:32.730]
Who cares?

[02:37:32.910 --> 02:37:33.870]
Are there first screamingers?

[02:37:35.050 --> 02:37:36.910]
Do they look like screamers, do you sir?

[02:37:37.510 --> 02:37:39.310]
Do you know what a Screamer is?

[02:37:39.510 --> 02:37:40.770]
Do you know what a Screamer is?

[02:37:41.710 --> 02:37:42.650]
Yeah, that's a Screamer.

[02:37:43.870 --> 02:37:44.230]
Wow.

[02:37:45.150 --> 02:37:45.510]
Aw!

[02:37:47.050 --> 02:37:47.770]
Hey, man!

[02:37:48.470 --> 02:37:48.990]
WQA-M.

[02:37:49.090 --> 02:37:49.190]
Hello.

[02:37:50.370 --> 02:37:51.170]
Yes, please.

[02:37:52.410 --> 02:37:52.870]
Yes, please.

[02:37:52.870 --> 02:37:53.610]
Deputy QAAM, hello.

[02:37:54.510 --> 02:37:55.110]
Yeah, Neil.

[02:37:55.490 --> 02:37:55.730]
Yeah.

[02:37:56.310 --> 02:37:58.670]
I got an idea that I will improve the radio station.

[02:37:59.150 --> 02:37:59.370]
Yes.

[02:37:59.970 --> 02:38:00.790]
Bring back DFO.

[02:38:01.030 --> 02:38:01.770]
He's looking for a job.

[02:38:02.170 --> 02:38:02.590]
Yeah, okay.

[02:38:02.810 --> 02:38:03.510]
You bring him back.

[02:38:03.670 --> 02:38:04.330]
Bring him back to the house.

[02:38:04.430 --> 02:38:07.530]
Maybe he can do a stand-up in your living room or sit down.

[02:38:11.310 --> 02:38:11.710]
DFO.

[02:38:11.990 --> 02:38:13.970]
I don't understand these people with DFO, do you?

[02:38:15.010 --> 02:38:15.250]
No.

[02:38:16.330 --> 02:38:17.130]
I don't get it.

[02:38:17.130 --> 02:38:18.170]
I mean, maybe they like corn.

[02:38:18.310 --> 02:38:19.570]
They're corn sure is special, you know?

[02:38:20.930 --> 02:38:22.510]
21 for two at 560 W.

[02:38:22.610 --> 02:38:24.250]
We got mad dog at two this afternoon.

[02:38:24.990 --> 02:38:28.970]
Don't forget, Monday at the 10.05 we're expecting that call in the bat line from Joel Feinberg.

[02:38:29.150 --> 02:38:31.010]
We're going to negotiate our new deal.

[02:38:31.010 --> 02:38:31.570]
Not just me.

[02:38:31.830 --> 02:38:32.750]
See, I'll take care of you.

[02:38:33.170 --> 02:38:33.370]
Chris?

[02:38:34.290 --> 02:38:35.130]
I don't know.

[02:38:36.170 --> 02:38:36.510]
What do you think?

[02:38:36.590 --> 02:38:37.570]
Should we take him with us or not?

[02:38:37.750 --> 02:38:38.090]
I don't know.

[02:38:39.810 --> 02:38:40.990]
What about Josh Curtis?

[02:38:41.570 --> 02:38:42.070]
What about him?

[02:38:42.630 --> 02:38:43.530]
You want to take him over there?

[02:38:44.450 --> 02:38:44.830]
I don't know.

[02:38:44.910 --> 02:38:45.490]
We'll see what he says.

[02:38:45.490 --> 02:38:46.150]
I'll talk to him.

[02:38:46.150 --> 02:38:47.230]
He could handle a website.

[02:38:47.370 --> 02:38:51.190]
That website of theirs sure could use some work, you know, instead of all the fake people

[02:38:51.190 --> 02:38:53.250]
on there, the fake this one and the fake bad one.

[02:38:53.270 --> 02:38:55.030]
I guess they think that's very funny, by the way.

[02:38:55.790 --> 02:38:57.930]
Chris McGulls already over there, so we know we'll have a promotion.

[02:38:57.930 --> 02:38:59.130]
That's true, we'll get some promotion.

[02:38:59.570 --> 02:39:00.930]
It'll likely do some things for us.

[02:39:01.090 --> 02:39:02.490]
See you on our top, little boy.

[02:39:04.470 --> 02:39:05.170]
Goodbye Kenny.

[02:39:05.570 --> 02:39:05.930]
Kimbo.

[02:39:06.610 --> 02:39:07.810]
Let's pack our things and go.

[02:39:07.990 --> 02:39:08.210]
Sure.

[02:39:08.630 --> 02:39:12.870]
We got to clean up there and make room for the next bad morning show.

[02:39:12.870 --> 02:39:15.390]
You know, that's the situation, sure, dear.

[02:39:15.570 --> 02:39:16.390]
I know.

[02:39:16.590 --> 02:39:17.310]
Fight, sport.

[02:39:17.570 --> 02:39:18.190]
Fight, sport.

[02:39:18.290 --> 02:39:19.910]
The planning station's Lincoln girl.

[02:39:20.270 --> 02:39:21.190]
Fight, sport.

[02:39:21.510 --> 02:39:22.010]
Fight, sport.

[02:39:22.350 --> 02:39:23.550]
Till in Ducicoma.

[02:39:24.090 --> 02:39:28.250]
I don't think we've gushed enough over all the damaged columnist Jews.

[02:39:28.990 --> 02:39:29.370]
You know?

[02:39:29.530 --> 02:39:31.010]
We take pride in broadcasting.

[02:39:31.650 --> 02:39:32.330]
Do do.

[02:39:33.330 --> 02:39:34.010]
Do do.

[02:39:34.770 --> 02:39:36.550]
It's a management state.

[02:39:36.950 --> 02:39:38.070]
That is all it's saying.

[02:39:38.630 --> 02:39:41.810]
To us all in half the least pain.

[02:39:42.570 --> 02:39:43.570]
And when that fails.

[02:39:44.030 --> 02:39:46.990]
And what you got there is a situation, amazing, but I love sports.

[02:39:47.370 --> 02:39:47.790]
I'm here.

[02:39:48.470 --> 02:39:48.750]
I'm here.

[02:39:49.370 --> 02:39:49.510]
I'm here.

[02:39:50.450 --> 02:39:52.210]
The back one hill building's done.

[02:39:52.470 --> 02:39:52.810]
Yeah.

[02:39:53.210 --> 02:39:55.110]
Look, one less in there is here.

[02:39:56.150 --> 02:40:03.210]
All you need to be successful in Brady home is two or three sport, whole sick of fanfares.

[02:40:03.930 --> 02:40:04.330]
Fight, sport.

[02:40:04.790 --> 02:40:05.210]
Fight, sport.

[02:40:06.170 --> 02:40:06.730]
Fight, sport.

[02:40:07.790 --> 02:40:08.490]
Fight, sport.

[02:40:08.650 --> 02:40:09.090]
Fight, sport.

[02:40:09.630 --> 02:40:09.690]
Fight, sport.

[02:40:09.690 --> 02:40:09.750]
Fight, sport.

[02:40:10.210 --> 02:40:10.970]
Fight, sport.

[02:40:12.530 --> 02:40:13.950]
145 out the door.

[02:40:14.330 --> 02:40:19.250]
When you told me that Drew Rosenstein, Cran's house, was up with the Joe and what's his name this morning?

[02:40:19.570 --> 02:40:20.630]
And that he did a live spot.

[02:40:21.070 --> 02:40:23.210]
That's just put me over the edge.

[02:40:24.670 --> 02:40:26.910]
I mean, you do actually hear this with your own ear or what?

[02:40:27.230 --> 02:40:27.390]
Yes.

[02:40:29.850 --> 02:40:31.430]
What is the fascination with him?

[02:40:31.430 --> 02:40:35.010]
Other than he's got some sponsor that will like pay to put his ass on the ear?

[02:40:35.410 --> 02:40:35.990]
What were they saying?

[02:40:37.130 --> 02:40:38.850]
I don't want to hear what the sponsor is.

[02:40:38.950 --> 02:40:41.070]
We don't want to blow out the sponsor because that's all we're here for.

[02:40:41.250 --> 02:40:41.350]
Okay.

[02:40:41.410 --> 02:40:42.510]
What is wrong with you?

[02:40:42.550 --> 02:40:43.790]
Are you a crazy person or what?

[02:40:43.930 --> 02:40:44.050]
Yes.

[02:40:44.770 --> 02:40:45.930]
That's not what I'm talking about.

[02:40:45.990 --> 02:40:47.970]
I'm just saying, what is the obsession with him?

[02:40:48.990 --> 02:40:55.730]
So I guess basically what it boils down to the jolly jolly mentality and the philosophy of QM now is if you can find a sponsor

[02:40:56.210 --> 02:40:59.590]
who will let you do a live commercial for them, we will put you on a ear.

[02:41:03.110 --> 02:41:03.430]
Okay.

[02:41:04.670 --> 02:41:05.990]
And you have to talk sports.

[02:41:06.550 --> 02:41:08.570]
Oh, of course that goes without saying I could do that.

[02:41:09.370 --> 02:41:09.970]
You could do what?

[02:41:10.250 --> 02:41:10.790]
Find a sponsor.

[02:41:12.030 --> 02:41:13.430]
Yeah, but you can't talk sports.

[02:41:13.670 --> 02:41:14.110]
That's right.

[02:41:14.270 --> 02:41:15.770]
So therefore you're out.

[02:41:16.290 --> 02:41:16.510]
You're out.

[02:41:16.610 --> 02:41:18.350]
So you better go across the street with me next week.

[02:41:18.470 --> 02:41:19.090]
Yeah, I think I will.

[02:41:20.530 --> 02:41:23.690]
56070560, pound 560 in the Verizon Singular wireless line.

[02:41:24.590 --> 02:41:25.550]
WDQA and hello.

[02:41:26.330 --> 02:41:31.450]
Sir, you are absolutely correct about Mr. Rosencrantz or Gilden Stern or whatever's name is.

[02:41:31.870 --> 02:41:34.430]
He's got as much credibility as Larry Craig.

[02:41:35.530 --> 02:41:38.770]
And quite frankly, he's Levitt Hart, twin brother.

[02:41:39.010 --> 02:41:42.050]
I have no use for him and he's blocking up your airwaves.

[02:41:42.990 --> 02:41:44.530]
You guys need to be like a plug toilet.

[02:41:45.130 --> 02:41:45.630]
Exactly.

[02:41:46.070 --> 02:41:46.370]
Exactly.

[02:41:47.430 --> 02:41:50.030]
By the way, he likes to say that he's Jerry McGuire.

[02:41:50.290 --> 02:41:50.910]
Let me tell you something.

[02:41:51.090 --> 02:41:52.050]
That was Lee Steinberg.

[02:41:52.330 --> 02:41:55.610]
He's a pale imitation of Lee Steinberg and he's a schmuck.

[02:41:56.170 --> 02:41:56.390]
Amen.

[02:41:57.010 --> 02:41:57.470]
I'm out.

[02:41:57.770 --> 02:41:58.010]
Thank you.

[02:41:58.050 --> 02:41:59.850]
You all said, how will it be a nice go on, pal?

[02:41:59.950 --> 02:42:00.150]
He's good.

[02:42:00.250 --> 02:42:01.390]
There's the best go we had all day.

[02:42:01.630 --> 02:42:03.430]
Other than Joel Feinberg, of course, that he whole.

[02:42:05.310 --> 02:42:06.330]
943 votes on the pool.

[02:42:06.330 --> 02:42:06.930]
But that's weak.

[02:42:07.030 --> 02:42:08.470]
I don't even know if we're going to get to 950.

[02:42:09.490 --> 02:42:11.150]
I'm telling you, man, he did something.

[02:42:11.310 --> 02:42:11.950]
He put the hex.

[02:42:12.210 --> 02:42:13.150]
You know those rich people.

[02:42:13.330 --> 02:42:15.310]
They got all kinds of gizmos and stuff.

[02:42:15.990 --> 02:42:18.570]
He probably hired Mickey Dayne or one of those psychic people

[02:42:18.570 --> 02:42:19.810]
to put a hex on the pool.

[02:42:19.810 --> 02:42:20.570]
I wouldn't have been able to call him.

[02:42:20.650 --> 02:42:21.890]
A Haitian voodoo witch doctor.

[02:42:22.030 --> 02:42:22.870]
You think that's what it was?

[02:42:22.890 --> 02:42:24.010]
We got lots of them here in town.

[02:42:24.130 --> 02:42:26.430]
Or maybe a Jamaican witch doctor might have been it.

[02:42:26.470 --> 02:42:27.110]
A Haitian.

[02:42:27.290 --> 02:42:27.850]
Yeah, I'm on.

[02:42:29.210 --> 02:42:31.030]
Which then Jamaicans, you know, they got the good stuff.

[02:42:31.170 --> 02:42:33.570]
Some of them.

[02:42:33.570 --> 02:42:35.270]
W-W-W-Q-A-M. Hello.

[02:42:35.770 --> 02:42:36.810]
Hey, Neil, how you doing?

[02:42:37.110 --> 02:42:37.550]
Okay, sir.

[02:42:38.050 --> 02:42:38.870]
Let's talk politics.

[02:42:40.510 --> 02:42:41.990]
I'm only a few years younger.

[02:42:42.110 --> 02:42:42.630]
Are you still there?

[02:42:42.910 --> 02:42:43.250]
I'm here.

[02:42:43.790 --> 02:42:47.570]
I'm only a few years younger than you, but I do not believe in our lifetime

[02:42:47.570 --> 02:42:52.250]
that either a black man or a woman will be elected president.

[02:42:52.450 --> 02:42:52.950]
What do you think?

[02:42:53.710 --> 02:42:54.990]
I think you're wrong on both.

[02:42:55.810 --> 02:42:56.310]
Oh, really?

[02:42:56.950 --> 02:42:57.150]
Yeah.

[02:42:57.770 --> 02:42:59.870]
So what should be the first one to happen?

[02:42:59.970 --> 02:43:01.930]
Obama or Ms. Clinton?

[02:43:02.450 --> 02:43:04.030]
I'm hoping for Obama, of course.

[02:43:04.930 --> 02:43:05.410]
Uh-huh.

[02:43:06.250 --> 02:43:07.690]
I think you're probably right.

[02:43:07.750 --> 02:43:09.230]
There's a lot of clasers in America.

[02:43:09.370 --> 02:43:11.850]
They just, you know, they'll find some other excuse

[02:43:11.850 --> 02:43:12.870]
whether or not they want to vote for you.

[02:43:12.930 --> 02:43:14.330]
It really has to do with the fact that you're black.

[02:43:15.310 --> 02:43:16.410]
And have a great day.

[02:43:16.530 --> 02:43:17.030]
He just vanished.

[02:43:18.350 --> 02:43:19.170]
W-W-Q-A-M. Hello.

[02:43:20.090 --> 02:43:20.730]
Daniel, what's up?

[02:43:21.130 --> 02:43:21.510]
Yes, sir.

[02:43:24.110 --> 02:43:25.190]
W-W-Q-A-M. Hello.

[02:43:26.830 --> 02:43:28.190]
Ah, yeah.

[02:43:29.850 --> 02:43:30.950]
W-W-Q-A-M. Hello.

[02:43:31.470 --> 02:43:31.790]
Hello.

[02:43:31.990 --> 02:43:32.210]
Hello, Neil.

[02:43:32.850 --> 02:43:35.130]
When we take the colors like Eddie across the street,

[02:43:35.330 --> 02:43:36.850]
then they're going to miss this big time, you know what?

[02:43:37.390 --> 02:43:39.510]
Then they're going to really regret treating us like crap.

[02:43:40.050 --> 02:43:42.310]
You're going to be sorry if that asked, Jolly Joe.

[02:43:43.610 --> 02:43:44.490]
W-W-Q-A-M. Hello.

[02:43:44.890 --> 02:43:47.990]
Hey, Neil, I'm not a sport-hole, but I haven't able to, uh,

[02:43:48.410 --> 02:43:50.670]
listen to Hank and manage everyone's amount.

[02:43:50.810 --> 02:43:52.690]
But that morning show was the same as the old show.

[02:43:53.110 --> 02:43:54.370]
I tuned in twice yesterday.

[02:43:54.870 --> 02:43:55.550]
The shoot it was like.

[02:43:55.630 --> 02:43:57.690]
And the first time I tuned in, it was about football.

[02:43:58.050 --> 02:44:00.570]
And the second time it was about all the road-induced,

[02:44:00.770 --> 02:44:02.390]
whatever his name is, the sport agent.

[02:44:02.550 --> 02:44:03.370]
It's the same show.

[02:44:04.150 --> 02:44:06.730]
I just slammed my f*** in the door to get the memory.

[02:44:07.370 --> 02:44:07.590]
Yeah.

[02:44:08.210 --> 02:44:11.190]
So, you don't like Joe Rosen-Douge?

[02:44:11.510 --> 02:44:12.950]
Joe Rosen-Douge, that's the man.

[02:44:13.170 --> 02:44:15.810]
I just slammed my f*** in the car door just to forget the memory.

[02:44:17.050 --> 02:44:17.490]
Okay.

[02:44:17.970 --> 02:44:18.310]
See ya.

[02:44:18.530 --> 02:44:19.330]
Well, he's good with that button.

[02:44:20.150 --> 02:44:20.310]
Why?

[02:44:20.590 --> 02:44:21.350]
He's good with that button.

[02:44:21.850 --> 02:44:22.110]
Is he?

[02:44:22.630 --> 02:44:23.230]
Is that color?

[02:44:24.590 --> 02:44:25.430]
Self-sensory?

[02:44:25.870 --> 02:44:26.910]
W-Q-A-M, hello.

[02:44:27.410 --> 02:44:31.250]
Hey, Neil, I was listening last night to one of your old cities,

[02:44:31.410 --> 02:44:34.690]
like 95, 97, the, uh, Camila House City you put out there.

[02:44:35.050 --> 02:44:35.270]
Yeah.

[02:44:35.730 --> 02:44:38.370]
And, uh, the material that's in there, Jesus,

[02:44:38.530 --> 02:44:39.990]
if you could play that on the radio now,

[02:44:40.710 --> 02:44:43.590]
you, you have like, like 20 points because,

[02:44:43.990 --> 02:44:44.750]
yeah, well, guess what?

[02:44:44.850 --> 02:44:45.610]
We can't and we don't.

[02:44:45.630 --> 02:44:46.890]
I'd like to ask you, yeah.

[02:44:47.090 --> 02:44:48.210]
We'd have 20 points.

[02:44:50.510 --> 02:44:51.710]
940 votes on that pool.

[02:44:51.710 --> 02:44:53.910]
Boy, we just, uh, it's like, like I said,

[02:44:54.070 --> 02:44:55.570]
somebody put the caboch on us.

[02:44:55.930 --> 02:44:58.150]
You think that maybe after a jewel fiber called in,

[02:44:58.150 --> 02:44:59.090]
they turn the transmitter on?

[02:44:59.350 --> 02:44:59.350]

[02:44:59.350 --> 02:45:00.110]
The shish caboch.

[02:45:00.470 --> 02:45:01.390]
The shish cabab?

[02:45:01.870 --> 02:45:03.630]
So, how was the food today, by the way, from the road?

[02:45:03.870 --> 02:45:04.230]
Are you kidding me?

[02:45:04.230 --> 02:45:05.030]
It was spectacular.

[02:45:05.450 --> 02:45:05.770]
Fantastic.

[02:45:05.910 --> 02:45:06.090]
Yeah.

[02:45:06.170 --> 02:45:07.710]
Things sold out in 18 minutes, by the way.

[02:45:07.810 --> 02:45:09.670]
It's always an adventure when, uh, you got food from them.

[02:45:10.530 --> 02:45:11.310]
Dominic Q.A.M. Hello.

[02:45:12.050 --> 02:45:13.570]
Going back to when you are in the am.

[02:45:14.550 --> 02:45:15.550]
Dominic Q.A.M. Hello.

[02:45:16.790 --> 02:45:17.790]
Dominic Q.A.M. Hello.

[02:45:17.790 --> 02:45:18.450]
Dominic Q.A.M.

[02:45:18.570 --> 02:45:21.130]
I said, you're gay.

[02:45:21.930 --> 02:45:22.990]
Oh, thank you so much.

[02:45:23.130 --> 02:45:23.910]
Dominic Q.A.M. Hello.

[02:45:24.170 --> 02:45:25.150]
We love it, George.

[02:45:26.090 --> 02:45:27.110]
Dominic Q.A.M. Hello.

[02:45:28.290 --> 02:45:28.770]
Dominic Q.A.M. Hello.

[02:45:28.770 --> 02:45:29.390]
Dominic Q.A.M. Hello.

[02:45:30.130 --> 02:45:30.670]
Dominic Q.A.M. Hello.

[02:45:30.790 --> 02:45:31.390]
Dominic Q.A.M. Hello.

[02:45:31.390 --> 02:45:31.770]
Dominic Q.A.M. Hello.

[02:45:35.150 --> 02:45:36.090]
Dominic Q.A.M. Hello.

[02:45:37.210 --> 02:45:37.950]
Dominic Q.A.M. Hello.

[02:45:37.950 --> 02:45:37.950]

[02:45:37.950 --> 02:45:37.950]

[02:45:37.950 --> 02:45:37.950]

[02:45:37.950 --> 02:45:38.050]
Dominic Q.A.M. Hello.

[02:45:38.370 --> 02:45:38.370]

[02:45:38.370 --> 02:45:38.770]
Dominic Q.A.M.

[02:45:38.770 --> 02:45:39.030]
How are you?

[02:45:39.050 --> 02:45:39.730]
Dominic Q.A.M. How are you?

[02:45:41.290 --> 02:45:46.310]
Dominic Q.A.M. Hello.

[02:45:52.070 --> 02:45:53.070]
Dominic Q.A.M. Hello.

[02:45:54.130 --> 02:45:55.350]
Dominic Q.A.M. Hello.

[02:45:56.170 --> 02:45:59.550]
Dominic Q.A.M. Hello.

[02:45:59.550 --> 02:45:59.550]

[02:45:59.550 --> 02:45:59.550]

[02:45:59.550 --> 02:45:59.550]

[02:45:59.550 --> 02:45:59.550]

[02:45:59.550 --> 02:45:59.550]

[02:45:59.550 --> 02:46:00.350]
Yeah, sir.

[02:46:00.350 --> 02:46:01.670]
I'm sorry, let me read you down.

[02:46:02.170 --> 02:46:02.290]
Please.

[02:46:03.790 --> 02:46:05.450]
I got two rows.

[02:46:05.750 --> 02:46:08.190]
I was really missed of the day to truth.

[02:46:08.750 --> 02:46:11.870]
The stupid and better morning so it was so bad

[02:46:11.870 --> 02:46:14.270]
I had to listen to Bid.

[02:46:14.710 --> 02:46:16.290]
It was bad as he is.

[02:46:16.810 --> 02:46:21.150]
But then I turned on and they have the Drew Rosenhaus hour on

[02:46:21.150 --> 02:46:24.390]
and he's doing live spots for a little day

[02:46:24.390 --> 02:46:27.370]
but he's on a positive sponsor.

[02:46:28.190 --> 02:46:30.910]
They're killing himself from day two now.

[02:46:32.290 --> 02:46:37.050]
I wish he could just be by himself and not with eight hours of

[02:46:37.830 --> 02:46:39.970]
spots every hour.

[02:46:40.650 --> 02:46:42.250]
Eight hours every five minutes.

[02:46:42.650 --> 02:46:43.910]
Yeah, they're killing him.

[02:46:44.210 --> 02:46:46.430]
They're not even giving him a chance to succeed.

[02:46:46.930 --> 02:46:48.070]
They don't want to give him a chance.

[02:46:48.230 --> 02:46:49.490]
They don't want to give anybody a chance.

[02:46:49.610 --> 02:46:50.070]
Don't you understand?

[02:46:50.370 --> 02:46:52.310]
They just want the F and money baby.

[02:46:52.490 --> 02:46:53.270]
Don't you understand?

[02:46:54.070 --> 02:46:55.610]
They just want the F and money.

[02:46:57.070 --> 02:46:58.090]
Succeed my ass.

[02:46:59.050 --> 02:47:00.830]
Anyway, we have 953 votes.

[02:47:00.930 --> 02:47:02.090]
But we made our 950, Chris.

[02:47:02.230 --> 02:47:02.830]
Aren't you excited?

[02:47:03.170 --> 02:47:03.670]
I'm depressed.

[02:47:04.150 --> 02:47:04.750]
So excited.

[02:47:05.070 --> 02:47:06.450]
I am so depressed, man.

[02:47:06.590 --> 02:47:08.730]
In fact, Monday when I make that new deal with Joel Feinberg

[02:47:08.730 --> 02:47:10.010]
for us all to go across the street,

[02:47:10.210 --> 02:47:11.470]
we'll even take Chris with us.

[02:47:11.610 --> 02:47:12.130]
What they killed.

[02:47:12.370 --> 02:47:13.590]
If he'll take you, by the way.

[02:47:13.630 --> 02:47:14.590]
I don't know they'll take you.

[02:47:14.670 --> 02:47:15.170]
That's true.

[02:47:15.530 --> 02:47:17.030]
Because he might send a message to George.

[02:47:17.030 --> 02:47:18.390]
He might send him a text message saying,

[02:47:18.730 --> 02:47:21.630]
yeah, you're a, and I don't want Chris because he's an A-hole.

[02:47:21.770 --> 02:47:22.090]
You're out.

[02:47:25.650 --> 02:47:27.150]
Now here's a message that says,

[02:47:27.350 --> 02:47:29.990]
Drew Rosenduesh is better than Dan LeBadduesh.

[02:47:30.710 --> 02:47:31.630]
Oh, LeBadduesh.

[02:47:32.210 --> 02:47:32.670]
LeBaster.

[02:47:32.970 --> 02:47:34.650]
Yeah, I don't know if I really want to work with Dan LeBaster.

[02:47:34.750 --> 02:47:36.270]
I guess I probably never have to see him though.

[02:47:36.570 --> 02:47:37.470]
Tell me to listen.

[02:47:37.710 --> 02:47:38.170]
Wonderful.

[02:47:38.810 --> 02:47:40.610]
I'm sure he killed the feeling of me.

[02:47:41.170 --> 02:47:41.630]
560.

[02:47:42.130 --> 02:47:42.630]
Yes, man.

[02:47:43.490 --> 02:47:44.230]
It's day.

[02:47:44.810 --> 02:47:46.090]
If I have a child.

[02:47:46.570 --> 02:47:48.570]
I'll whack at 560.

[02:47:49.390 --> 02:47:51.190]
W-U-A-N.

[02:47:51.190 --> 02:47:52.830]
Uh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

[02:47:55.790 --> 02:47:59.090]
He unreasonable is in a weight of girls.

[02:47:59.350 --> 02:48:01.170]
The paralyzed중 does it when

[02:48:01.170 --> 02:48:03.910]
the groomer toará her.

[02:48:03.910 --> 02:48:05.990]
But whatuwlaLmyD

[02:48:06.990 --> 02:48:12.810]
She enjoys the company of chicks, doing all sorts of naughty tricks,

[02:48:13.210 --> 02:48:17.030]
because she's a part of the living.

[02:48:18.550 --> 02:48:22.550]
She has a little touch and a tell you the song.

[02:48:24.270 --> 02:48:28.530]
Because she's a recreational lesbian,

[02:48:29.630 --> 02:48:33.970]
thinking of girls with boys but bad in the ride.

[02:48:33.970 --> 02:48:40.170]
But when she wakes up, who's next to her is a cowboy guy?

[02:48:40.570 --> 02:48:43.110]
She's come, Kate, they call him a punk,

[02:48:43.510 --> 02:48:45.910]
then settle up with Shannon Fuck.

[02:48:46.270 --> 02:48:50.210]
Her former employee is a part of the lesbian.

[02:48:51.090 --> 02:48:51.510]
You're fair.

[02:48:51.630 --> 02:48:54.130]
When she gets sick of Steven Ben,

[02:48:54.510 --> 02:48:56.930]
she's on the prowl, one volume gen.

[02:48:57.330 --> 02:49:01.270]
Because Brittany is a part of the lesbian.

[02:49:02.370 --> 02:49:06.750]
When she gets sick of going, she turns today.

[02:49:08.030 --> 02:49:13.370]
And sometimes she goes to liberty, if that's good for Kate.

[02:49:14.010 --> 02:49:18.290]
I guess she just gave up the mating days.

[02:49:19.250 --> 02:49:23.810]
It's not for fun, maybe it's just a fail.

[02:49:25.030 --> 02:49:27.350]
Her is like a linking seal.

[02:49:27.810 --> 02:49:30.090]
She don't know what signals to give.

[02:49:30.090 --> 02:49:31.830]
She's like a lesbian, essentially confused.

[02:49:32.690 --> 02:49:34.390]
All time, a lesbian.

[02:49:35.590 --> 02:49:38.430]
She's out all night just chasing tail.

[02:49:38.810 --> 02:49:40.830]
It could be a male or female.

[02:49:41.530 --> 02:49:42.790]
It works for Brittany's fears.

[02:49:43.410 --> 02:49:45.350]
No more time, a lesbian.

[02:49:46.950 --> 02:49:47.950]
Bye, bye, bye.
