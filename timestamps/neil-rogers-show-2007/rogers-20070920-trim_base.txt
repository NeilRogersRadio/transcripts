[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.640]
gang rate is funny

[00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:03.840]
absolutely

[00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.840]
That's what's going on here a Q&A like I tell you that right now

[00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:09.400]
No

[00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.960]
Welcome don't do this don't play that and please no fart sound no

[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.560]
is

[00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:37.900]

[00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.280]
And

[00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.600]
Heard thunder and the wind were吵

[00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.940]
Yes, acost heightened lies

[00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.880]
and thrown in on the sol

[00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.680]
But the mighty castle boy

[00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.740]
did he know that wardı

[00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.280]
had not come to such

[00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.360]
Honey, babies and out for Christ, for the people of light,

[00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:11.960]
And the bench, where station should fight,

[00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.980]
And don't be proud of that dream and all the light,

[00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.660]
Who's risking so much from hell,

[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.780]
Oh, dead, paid in life,

[00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.640]
That's an object that weighs your life,

[00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.680]
Dead, paid in life,

[00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.040]
You let the people run in,

[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.080]
And be brought in, and your life,

[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.020]
Dead, paid in life,

[00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:36.360]
Dead, paid in life,

[00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:36.860]
You let the people run in,

[00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.080]
And your life,

[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.680]
Dead, paid in life,

[00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.940]
You let the people run in,

[00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.980]
And I know,

[00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:45.480]
Baby, how,

[00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:46.520]
So, how,

[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.780]
Now, there's a group we ought to do a poll on,

[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:49.720]
Somebody that grants fruits,

[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.040]
I love the grassroots,

[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.620]
But the only problem with that is,

[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.180]
What?

[00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.900]
Who the hell knows from the grassroots, me?

[00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:57.180]
Yeah, what about Chris?

[00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:58.040]
For the who?

[00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.380]
No, for the grassroots.

[00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.640]
For the who?

[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.000]
Not the who.

[00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:01.220]
That's another show.

[00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.220]
Not even the guess who.

[00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:05.960]
So, I know, that's the problem with that,

[00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.600]
And Charlie, he sends me a self-congratulatory email this morning,

[00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:10.940]
Oh, that was a great show!

[00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.840]
Oh, if I do say so myself!

[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:14.640]
Charlie, you're an idiot,

[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:15.860]
But keep the polls coming, baby,

[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.320]
Maybe someday you'll send us a good one.

[00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.420]
I don't see this current pile today.

[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.200]
If you really did find a finger in your chile,

[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.480]
Or a dead mouse in your chile,

[00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.400]
Or is what would you do?

[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.160]
There's nothing worse than finding a dead mouse,

[00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:28.840]
Especially in your pants.

[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:30.220]
But at any rate,

[00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.400]
Yeah, don't play any fart sounds,

[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.960]
And don't do this, and don't do that,

[00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.840]
And that's what we're up against.

[00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.800]
The reason I'm sour on this is because I'm thinking about that trend coming out tomorrow morning,

[00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.700]
And I think it's going to be a disaster,

[00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:42.220]
Because clearance,

[00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.280]
There is the master of disaster.

[00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.880]
That's a 1003 AM confession by the grassroots.

[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.660]
They don't know from the grassroots,

[00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:55.800]
Especially the punks.

[00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:56.760]
Do you think they know the grassroots?

[00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.680]
For Chris?

[00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.420]
No.

[00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.980]
It's serious.

[00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:00.820]
See, I was going to nail it right there,

[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:01.620]
And he kept it off.

[00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.800]
I don't know if it's there,

[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:03.760]
It could be a spank.

[00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.780]
Yes.

[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:05.480]
It could be a PR,

[00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.560]
I,

[00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:07.620]
Yeah, whatever.

[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.120]
All right, play any fart sounds,

[00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:10.560]
Joyce is going to get all of a sudden.

[00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:11.140]
You see,

[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.480]
If there's any rationale behind the crap that they foiced upon us,

[00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:17.500]
That would make a difference.

[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:18.920]
You know, then I might say,

[00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:19.860]
Okay, well, I understand.

[00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:20.760]
There is none.

[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.840]
It's just something that someone arbitrarily made up.

[00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:23.940]
In this case, Joyce Fitch.

[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.880]
And the clearance.

[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.500]
Oh, gee, you better be pleased.

[00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.680]
I'm a butt plug.

[00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.000]
Stop with the fart sounds.

[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.360]
You're an idiot clearance.

[00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:32.460]
That's all I can tell you, man.

[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:33.700]
And of course, even athletes,

[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.180]
Even Jackson locker room occasionally get fart.

[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.400]
Oh, that American dollar.

[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:39.660]
Thank you, Mr. What?

[00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.200]
Huh?

[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.380]
Mr. President, thank you so much for those low-gas prices,

[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.260]
And that really strong American dollar.

[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:47.800]
Wow.

[00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:49.200]
You're all hit.

[00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:50.460]
And let me just say on the ear,

[00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:51.180]
Before I get into this,

[00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:52.080]
Before I start this,

[00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:53.100]
A board of thing today.

[00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.700]
I want to just,

[00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.600]
I just put everybody in the world on notice.

[00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:57.980]
Not that most people care anymore,

[00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.220]
Because it's way past that.

[00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.700]
But what I've been telling George and Chris,

[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.620]
Before the show for the last few days,

[00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:04.600]
Is that one day,

[00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.120]
You're going to turn on the radio,

[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.200]
And George is going to say,

[00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:09.800]
I don't know where the old man is,

[00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:10.640]
But he's not here today.

[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:11.420]
Right, I think he jumped.

[00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.980]
No, I'm not going to jump.

[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.240]
But if you do, remember to take the mic with you.

[00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.320]
Yeah, it would be fun listening on the way down.

[00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:20.540]
It would be fun listening on the way down.

[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:21.780]
But I'm going to just tell you,

[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.720]
One of these days, I'm like just getting the old,

[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.300]
And that nice new car that I am going to have in the next couple of days,

[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:27.800]
Haven't got it yet, but I'll be getting it.

[00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:29.340]
I'm just getting that baby,

[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:30.400]
And it wouldn't have to be nice to just,

[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.000]
I don't know, tool around.

[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.380]
Drive off the bus.

[00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:33.280]
Of course, with a price of gas,

[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.000]
And that very weak American dollar.

[00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.340]
The year old this morning,

[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.800]
Had a new record of $1.40.

[00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.000]
And the Canadian dollar,

[00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.540]
Let me turn on the financial network here,

[00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.120]
And see, it was 99.68.

[00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.520]
It was as close to parity with the,

[00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.960]
Even Stephen,

[00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.180]
With the US dollars, it has been in the Zillion years,

[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.080]
Which of course means no American tourists are going to be coming here,

[00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.960]
Which isn't all bad.

[00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:59.160]
But the number two,

[00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:00.960]
For those of us who have paid American currency,

[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.180]
Used to have a really sweet deal,

[00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:03.660]
Now it's like a hell.

[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.020]
Thank you, Mr. President,

[00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.580]
For destroying the American economy.

[00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.320]
With your butture, it's war in the rank.

[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.380]
With your massive destruction of human life,

[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:15.060]
With your lunacy, insanity, madness,

[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:16.340]
While everybody's worried about,

[00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:19.620]
Oh, OJ, OJ, was instead a poor OJ.

[00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:22.380]
And the gene is six, oh my god.

[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.840]
There's how sharp it and Jesse Jackson, again,

[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.560]
Doing their usual grandstanding.

[00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.760]
It's just the 99.92,

[00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.340]
All of the Canadian dollar is on the verge, baby.

[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:33.660]
Michael.

[00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:34.420]
Yeah, Pat.

[00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:36.200]
So the CSF composite index is down.

[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:37.900]
We don't care about the composite, you idiot.

[00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.020]
Speaking with Jack, a composite.

[00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:41.220]
That's it.

[00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:42.740]
I mean, these are good people here,

[00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:44.580]
But stuffy, in some cases,

[00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:45.200]
All the money.

[00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:47.520]
A dollar 40 on the euro.

[00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:48.760]
Do you know when the euro started,

[00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.620]
I think it was like a worth about 79 cents.

[00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.100]
And then for a long time, it was like 92 cents, 94 cents.

[00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.820]
And now it's a dollar 40 against the US dollar.

[00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.100]
Markets are also nervous,

[00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.700]
They're waiting statements on the American economy

[00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:00.680]
by US officials later in the day today.

[00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:03.140]
The euro has hit new highs,

[00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.760]
Regulations, the rate cut on Tuesday,

[00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:07.560]
It rose to 139.88 during yesterday's trading.

[00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.060]
And now it got to 140.06.

[00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.100]
So it means if you're going to be traveling to Europe,

[00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:14.180]
You better have some serious dollars, baby,

[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.160]
Or somebody else's credit card.

[00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:19.260]
Because you're going to have real tourists,

[00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:21.000]
A buck 40.

[00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:26.140]
But nevertheless, just stay and don't worry about the important stuff.

[00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.480]
Like OJ and Lindsay Lohan,

[00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:29.840]
Crap, Crap like that.

[00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:31.060]
Here's the poll today,

[00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:32.840]
And Brandon's all excited about this.

[00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:33.680]
I told you it was good.

[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:34.720]
I never said it was bad.

[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:36.980]
I just said we've been 40 trillion times, sweetie.

[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:37.880]
Just relax.

[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:41.380]
915 votes on the poll today.

[00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:44.400]
So I guess we might be fairly safe to assume we're going to make a thousand, Chris.

[00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:46.260]
Sounds good to me.

[00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:49.280]
When you have 900 plus going in, I think that's not too bad.

[00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:52.480]
Best burgers in town come from or came from.

[00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.500]
It could be a place out of business and some of these are.

[00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:57.180]
Fudruckers is kicking ass, 211.

[00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:00.280]
Now I thought that maybe that was getting a little freak job on there,

[00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:03.520]
That there were some people who were like loading up on Fudruckers.

[00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:05.720]
And isn't the one there in plantation out of business?

[00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:06.580]
Isn't it closed down?

[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.240]
And one recorder sunrise and whatever that was,

[00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:08.940]
Pine Islander.

[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:09.800]
Huh?

[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:10.420]
I don't know.

[00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:12.520]
It's gone.

[00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:15.060]
It's fire reports on it.

[00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:15.460]
It's locked.

[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:16.580]
I do believe.

[00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.220]
But nevertheless, Fudruckers 211, if they just wouldn't butter the bun.

[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:25.640]
If you're one of those people with a sensitive stomach and you don't want to be having a wild screaming diarrhea,

[00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:27.400]
Then tell them, oh, hold the butter.

[00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:28.400]
Don't butter the bun, please.

[00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:29.380]
And then you'll be, it's great.

[00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:32.000]
And I like that goopy cheese they could put on it too.

[00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:34.020]
You know what I'm talking about?

[00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:34.400]
Oh, yeah.

[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:35.220]
The goopy.

[00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:39.440]
I mean, same kind of goopy cheese they used to have in the tacos back at Taco Soleil back in the day,

[00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:41.100]
Before they closed down.

[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.340]
Fudruckers 211, try out 150.

[00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:45.660]
Wendy's 85.

[00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:47.920]
Boy, that's a big drop down to Wendy's.

[00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:49.800]
I voted for Wendy's.

[00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:50.920]
Wendy's.

[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:52.240]
Stake and Shake 78.

[00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:56.140]
I'm interested in that because all I hear is complaints.

[00:07:56.140 --> 00:08:00.260]
So, yeah, after all the years, I was touting Stake and Shake and the rest of the state and then we finally got it.

[00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:02.340]
They have less shakes, I will say that.

[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:03.840]
You can get the shakes when you go there?

[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:06.240]
I've never had a problem with other stuff there.

[00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:08.800]
But the burgers are like kind of fall apart.

[00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:10.180]
I don't know, maybe not anymore.

[00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:11.300]
Maybe they straighten out their meat.

[00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:13.260]
Stake and Shake 78.

[00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:16.700]
Arles Royal Castle, which I believe is coming back soon, many times 70.

[00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.420]
Those were the little neatly burgers.

[00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:20.880]
In and out 69.

[00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:24.760]
But I'm surprised that many people have heard of it or tried it the old in and out.

[00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:27.080]
That's in Vegas, Vegas, out west.

[00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:29.240]
White Castle 69.

[00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:32.580]
But I remember those days, checkers slash rallies, which is the same.

[00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:33.860]
And checkers is God.

[00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:35.060]
About 30, man.

[00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:38.120]
Burger King 29, Hardy's 25.

[00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:41.520]
I don't know, Hardy's, of course, they don't have Hardy's in South Florida at all.

[00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:43.160]
And we've been through discussing a million times.

[00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:43.780]
Right.

[00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:46.660]
I like those shroom burgers they got at Hardy's. Those are pretty good.

[00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:52.280]
Why is it that the rest of the state has got so many, I don't, I just don't understand it.

[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.300]
Crystal 22, it's not crystals, it's crystal, but that's okay.

[00:08:57.340 --> 00:08:59.500]
And there is that crystal on it in our power line road.

[00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:02.500]
Have you ever seen it?

[00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:03.520]
Nope.

[00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:04.600]
There is one there.

[00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:06.240]
Well, you see Crystal every day.

[00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:10.680]
McDonald's 19, Crystal Queer.

[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.720]
McDonald's 19, Sonic 18, Jack in the Box 15.

[00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:17.820]
Big boy 14, hey big boy.

[00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:20.960]
Fat Burger 8, Burger Chef 4.

[00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:23.060]
Hot and now 3.

[00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:25.520]
Oh boy, not hot and not now.

[00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:29.140]
What a piece of teardew.

[00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:34.960]
And the only reason they started that was because Pepsi was pissed off that these burger joints were using coke at the time.

[00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:35.900]
I mean coke and coke.

[00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:36.860]
Right.

[00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:39.820]
And so they said, well we're going to show you, we're going to put you out of business.

[00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:43.500]
We'll open up our own damn burger joints and drive through places.

[00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:45.500]
And that lasted about what, two minutes?

[00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:50.200]
Well, they do have, I mean Taco Bell is Pepsi owned and so is what else is.

[00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:52.780]
Conflicty Fraud.

[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:53.260]
Right, right.

[00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:54.460]
That's what I was thinking.

[00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:59.800]
And Vick and Herbs got two votes, which out of 933 they got two votes.

[00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:00.520]
They're long gone.

[00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:02.000]
It's a Rochester place.

[00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:05.240]
And they figured there's all these Rochesterians and South Florida.

[00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:07.900]
They're going to come down here and open in four-large a day and make a killing.

[00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:10.920]
Well, somebody got killed, whoever opened it.

[00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:16.360]
And you got a fact from somebody saying, hey put pick and herbs on there.

[00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:18.640]
They had the best damn burger and the idea, what did it say?

[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:22.200]
Oh, you want me to read it out of the garbage?

[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:24.660]
No, it's not worth getting out of the garbage.

[00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:25.260]
I'm just sorry.

[00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:25.640]
I did it.

[00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:27.580]
Please add, Vick and Herbs to the list.

[00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:28.720]
They were the only South Florida.

[00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:30.320]
They were only in South Florida for a short time.

[00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:33.420]
However, they're a cheeseburger with everything was the best I ever tasted.

[00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:34.740]
Hmm, it says like that.

[00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:36.420]
And let me say it again.

[00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:41.440]
If you ever come to Canada, do not try Harvey's hamburgers because, wow, man,

[00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:42.520]
must meet all along.

[00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:45.020]
You should just nasty stuff, nasty crap.

[00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:46.400]
Must meet all rotten.

[00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:49.900]
Anyway, here's the schedule for today.

[00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:51.320]
Let's see if we got anything good on today.

[00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:51.780]
Oh, that's right.

[00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:52.700]
We got the Hurricanes.

[00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:54.700]
Let's start the big game show now.

[00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:55.420]
Oh, right.

[00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:55.640]
No.

[00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:57.680]
I want to spin now.

[00:10:58.060 --> 00:10:58.500]
Give me a sec.

[00:10:58.680 --> 00:10:59.760]
Keep thinking of that guy, you know.

[00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:01.100]
What a jerk.

[00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:02.100]
What a jackass.

[00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:03.660]
Everywhere you go in life, they're a jerk.

[00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:04.240]
You know what I mean?

[00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:05.320]
Oh, yeah.

[00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:11.200]
There's always got to be one jackass idiot who just who has like he's never been

[00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:12.140]
lived out of the house before.

[00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:14.460]
Give me a spin now.

[00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:15.900]
And he's pointing at that third rear.

[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.860]
And the good thing is the whole time he was doing it, he never got one spin.

[00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:21.600]
He lost his ugly, stupid ass.

[00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:25.340]
Mad Dog, let's see, two to three thirty.

[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:26.680]
Oh, he's coming in for an hour and a half.

[00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:28.320]
Boy, that's really a white idiot baby.

[00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:28.560]
Right.

[00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:29.080]
That's going.

[00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:29.640]
We need that.

[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.040]
We need all the help we can get, especially with what Jolly Jo Bell is doing

[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:33.960]
with this radio station.

[00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:35.920]
You are a butcher, Jolly Jo.

[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:38.920]
Yeah, plus it counts as one of his 210 days or something.

[00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:41.220]
Yeah, it counts as one of his 85 days of year that he's working.

[00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:42.220]
So only an hour and a half.

[00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:43.300]
Nice scam, Mad Dog.

[00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:44.980]
I'm all for the talent.

[00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:48.840]
Hurricanes Game Day at 330, which is our four-hour pre-game show.

[00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:50.820]
We get a lot of spots in there, baby.

[00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:51.900]
I bet you that...

[00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:52.700]
Joseph Gacken.

[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:54.200]
Might show up on that abortion, too.

[00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:57.000]
Then we got UM football against Texas A&M 739.

[00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:58.280]
If they get wild to get in, boy.

[00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:00.400]
And let me say, Texas A&M, they got an offense.

[00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:01.940]
They put some points on the board.

[00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:05.040]
Put it on the board, as the Hawk would say.

[00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:07.280]
And anybody likes Ken Hiralson, I think she's a broadcaster.

[00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:08.100]
She's a crazy person.

[00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:11.200]
That was Josh Cordistop that the Hawk was good.

[00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:12.420]
Wasn't it, or was it the U-Chris?

[00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:15.380]
You don't know the court itself.

[00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:15.640]
You what?

[00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:18.060]
I have no problem with Andre Dawson, but it was probably Cordiston.

[00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:20.000]
Not Andre Dawson, that's the wrong Hawk.

[00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:21.020]
No, but Hiralson.

[00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:21.960]
Not even the Hawk.

[00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:22.240]
You don't like that.

[00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:26.580]
You're thinking of Andre Dawson, and then there's always chicken hawk.

[00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:30.120]
UM against Texas A&M 730, then at 1030, after the game,

[00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:32.080]
it's Hurricanes extra points for another hour and a half

[00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:33.740]
so we can squeeze a lot more spots in there.

[00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:36.800]
And then we got the Marlin stuff, as on A&M 940.

[00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:38.280]
Whichever understand this.

[00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:42.380]
But the Marlins and the Mess will be on 940, I&Z.

[00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:44.860]
And then after all, this Kakarai game went with an AK.

[00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:47.100]
How can that be?

[00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:50.160]
How can Gene that, with that AK, or what was that?

[00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:51.400]
Is that on 940?

[00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:52.200]
Also?

[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:53.560]
It says he's on tonight?

[00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:54.460]
Yeah.

[00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:55.340]
Yeah, he's not on tonight.

[00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:59.320]
Nice job at this casual appearance.

[00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:01.980]
You simple to, you jackass.

[00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:05.740]
I got some fart sounds, oh man, I'm going to give them to personal friends.

[00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:08.520]
I'm going to come down here and bend over and fart right in your face for hours.

[00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:12.060]
1013 at 560 WQM.

[00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:14.300]
We can't, for a week, more and more people are taking advantage of these

[00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:14.440]
meals.

[00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:16.140]
Have price deals on WQM.com.

[00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:16.540]
Guess what?

[00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:17.720]
It's Thursday, today's the day.

[00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:21.480]
Another big new restaurant offer starts at noon today, and by $50

[00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:25.080]
gifted to guests for just 25 bucks to left these tavern in Grille on

[00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:26.500]
State Road 84 in Davy.

[00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:29.060]
They offer fantastic food and a really fun atmosphere.

[00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:31.640]
Go for lunch or dinner or meet your friends for drinks and happy hour.

[00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:34.640]
Dinner on frozen food, grilled or blackened dolphin, fresh salmon,

[00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:38.600]
filet, snow crabs, king crab, lobster, pasta, chicken and veal dishes too.

[00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:41.260]
And they're states-filling, and you're on a New York strip skewer or grilled

[00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:41.680]
or perfection.

[00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:43.700]
And their raw bar is really outstanding as well.

[00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:46.920]
Frieders sandwiches, salads, and their famous chicken wings are a must.

[00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:50.260]
Left these tavern in Grille, they're on State Road 84 just west of

[00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:54.080]
Hyde, Israel called 954-474-1410.

And thanks to me, you'll be able to buy $15 gift certificates that have

[00:13:57.060 --> 00:14:00.080]
fresh disturbance around noon today, but act fast because once they're gone,

[00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:03.780]
they're gone, and lately they're moving fast like hot tamales in Mexico City.

[00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:06.920]
That's QWQM.com starting at about noon today.

[00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:10.000]
What's the best name of the best talent?

[00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:12.920]
New York is new largest sport radio 560 QAM.

[00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:14.920]
And they're sports leader.

[00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:16.280]
Frieders got.

[00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:20.400]
Toto to to do.

[00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:23.060]
Toto to to do.

[00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:25.360]
Way down yonder.

[00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:29.920]
In the heart of Dixie.

[00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:35.660]
The land of God done.

[00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:40.120]
And in our proceeding.

[00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:45.500]
Their trucklamps are cranking.

[00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:49.920]
Out with the fan of me.

[00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:56.680]
Churches of peace and doom.

[00:14:57.580 --> 00:14:58.960]
Or the last of the moon.

[00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:04.860]
Little meditation.

[00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:11.040]
The Christian bedmatch.

[00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:12.620]
New bedmatch.

[00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:13.360]
Reaction.

[00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:16.220]
Little meditation.

[00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:18.660]
Little bed.

[00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:24.040]
All of God's human.

[00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:24.540]
God.

[00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:29.060]
In God could do me.

[00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:34.360]
Now to do that, I'll take that.

[00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:38.760]
In trebenessly.

[00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:44.280]
Don't kill me, how nice.

[00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:47.940]
Most definitely.

[00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:53.340]
They're holding.

[00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:55.240]
Very poor.

[00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:57.740]
So they great more.

[00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:03.300]
Little meditation.

[00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:20.940]
Okay, it's 1020 at 560 WQAM.

[00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:23.760]
I never visited drugs much in my life.

[00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:25.140]
But I think I'm going to start now.

[00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:27.600]
Yeah, but too late to start.

[00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:28.500]
That's what George said.

[00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:30.920]
Well, I'm saving heroin for my old age.

[00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:33.380]
You know what I'm in a wheelchair with the IV drips.

[00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:34.120]
Oh, yeah.

[00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:34.640]
Yeah.

[00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:36.380]
No, I have a rip's not in good time.

[00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:37.380]
Because I'll be dead.

[00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:38.660]
I'll be putting in the channel.

[00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:40.040]
I'm changing the channel now.

[00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:43.100]
Oh, no, they're putting that.

[00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:43.300]
Yeah.

[00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:44.220]
He's getting that surgery.

[00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:45.120]
They said that was good.

[00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:47.920]
That was good.

[00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:48.120]
Right.

[00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:48.580]
That condition.

[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:48.920]
Yeah.

[00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:50.660]
God bless.

[00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:52.260]
Marmy Ali or whatever his name is.

[00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:53.060]
I don't want to see that.

[00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:53.660]
Jesus.

[00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:54.140]
God.

[00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:54.460]
Yeah.

[00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:56.920]
Please, out of the pool, five guys famous burger and fries.

[00:16:56.920 --> 00:17:00.180]
Recently opened in Florida, he also says this fan has great burgers.

[00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:01.660]
This is from University Dodge.

[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:02.760]
That the facts.

[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:03.200]
Interesting.

[00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:05.640]
Here's an email from somebody.

[00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:06.240]
Scott.

[00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:07.860]
Scott in Pinellas Park.

[00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:10.920]
He says Pinellas Park is the only place that can make tamarind look good.

[00:17:11.580 --> 00:17:12.500]
He says, I miss Charlie.

[00:17:12.620 --> 00:17:13.020]
Like crazy.

[00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:14.060]
I know we're here on the West Coast.

[00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:17.860]
I remember there was an in and out burger on state road of seven in Lauderdor.

[00:17:17.860 --> 00:17:19.520]
He'll back in the middle of the late 80s.

[00:17:19.620 --> 00:17:20.600]
I must have missed that.

[00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:22.860]
I remember so no in and out in Lauderdor.

[00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:23.060]
He'll.

[00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:26.560]
And it says if you want the best burger, well that's what the pool question is.

[00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:27.540]
Five guys.

[00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:30.420]
They're based in DC, but they're spreading out.

[00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:32.260]
One across the street from Me, Herndt Penelope Park.

[00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:34.180]
The idea of a burger is a double burger.

[00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:35.740]
Their fries are cooked in peanut oil.

[00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:36.540]
Wow.

[00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:38.000]
So thanks, Scott.

[00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:39.840]
So let's add five guys on there.

[00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:40.400]
You got Chris.

[00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:41.820]
Chris, whenever you need a five guys.

[00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:42.280]
Chris.

[00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:42.700]
Yeah.

[00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:44.140]
Ruth.

[00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:44.400]
Chris.

[00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:45.080]
Yeah.

[00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:46.100]
And wait till you hear this.

[00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:48.900]
Neil, where's the love for what a burger sir?

[00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:49.560]
Sir.

[00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:51.740]
I guess this is bridge tender junior.

[00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:52.940]
Everybody's a comedian.

[00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:53.320]
Everybody.

[00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:54.340]
Why is it want to be?

[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.640]
Where's the love for what a burger sir?

[00:17:57.980 --> 00:17:58.460]
Well, guess what?

[00:17:58.580 --> 00:17:59.720]
I never heard of what a burger.

[00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:01.440]
Maybe that's why I ain't got no love for it.

[00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:03.280]
They just put one up in Melbourne.

[00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:03.960]
It's pretty good.

[00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:05.340]
But I voted for steak and shake.

[00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:08.800]
Well, was there ever a what a burger in South Florida says what a burger is highly

[00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:10.320]
tempted to run a Texas from what I hear?

[00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:12.820]
Well, what is the pool question actually say?

[00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:16.820]
It says the best burgers came or come from well, we're talking South Florida.

[00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:21.000]
We're not talking about a lot of maybe there is or was a what a burger what what do you think?

[00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:25.300]
What I never know how do you want to put it on there go ahead.

[00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:25.820]
I don't care.

[00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:26.300]
It's right.

[00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:26.660]
I'm easy.

[00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:27.180]
It's free.

[00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:29.860]
Doesn't cost a dime to put it on there.

[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.380]
We can put all kinds of stuff on there.

[00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:35.540]
We got burgers chef on there with David on a business about a hundred years ago.

[00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:37.300]
That was the place where he had the fixins bar.

[00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:41.720]
And you go in there and you get your burger plain or your cheeseburger plain.

[00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:47.220]
And then you put your own fixins on there the onions and the ketchup kind of like going out to you getting the street meat.

[00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:51.580]
You know, like in real cities they have street meat.

[00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:55.260]
You go out there and you I don't think they have burgers at least not here anyway.

[00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:56.600]
You got sauce and hot dog.

[00:18:56.820 --> 00:18:57.440]
I don't understand.

[00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:00.420]
You're starting to cook on the grill which you can cook burgers on the grill.

[00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:02.600]
But for some reason they don't do that.

[00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:05.460]
Maybe they don't want them to pebble up and pull our burgers out there on the streets.

[00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:06.600]
I don't know what that's all about.

[00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:10.280]
So what kind of drugs would you suggest I should start doing?

[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.160]
Because see, fat ass Jolly, fat ass Jolly Joe doesn't realize it.

[00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:17.060]
But I'm thinking like maybe the end of the year I'm just going to send him like a note.

[00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:23.360]
And I'm not going to send it like email or anything quick like that like in a bottle, you know, like a post-it note.

[00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:26.220]
No, like in a bottle I'll drop it on a tearful.

[00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:27.280]
I hope it carries on.

[00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:28.940]
No, that's a good idea.

[00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:32.580]
Maybe it'll drop a little number on his head to it at the same time with the message.

[00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:34.880]
Hey Jolly Joe, bye bye, screw you.

[00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:36.840]
There you go. There's only one for your joy.

[00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:41.600]
Don't do this and don't say that and don't play this and don't do that.

[00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:47.780]
And this is the beastly effing way and these people think that they're going to be like the dominance day.

[00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:51.300]
They're in a dream world. They're losing it baby. They're losing it bad.

[00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:55.840]
It's oozing and we're losing. Can't you feel it like oozing away?

[00:19:58.140 --> 00:19:59.920]
That's what I was waiting for that.

[00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:00.920]
Very good, it's a little sluff.

[00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:02.080]
Yeah, I noticed.

[00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:07.300]
But that's okay because when it's oozing away sometimes it'll be a little slow.

[00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:09.920]
That's what we're choosing to be oozing.

[00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:13.660]
Yeah, as opposed to losing or cruising.

[00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:16.200]
We'll see tomorrow morning when that number comes out at 10 o'clock.

[00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:19.040]
Of course it doesn't mean the damn thing because I can feel it, I can smell it.

[00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:20.260]
You just know it really.

[00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:22.580]
Oh yeah, it's going to be bad.

[00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:24.700]
972 on the pole.

[00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:25.660]
What a burger to have any.

[00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:26.520]
We just put that on there.

[00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:27.600]
Five guys got one.

[00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:28.480]
Well, what we do.

[00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:29.740]
You ever hear of five guys?

[00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:32.540]
Nope. I remember that three guys pizza place.

[00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:36.220]
They used to be in Laudahill. A lot of things used to be in Laudahill too until all the right people moved up.

[00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:37.120]
But that's beside the point.

[00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:39.280]
But I don't want to turn into a racial thing.

[00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:40.700]
Oh, another explosion in Beirut.

[00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:42.320]
That was yesterday.

[00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:44.920]
So give us today's explosions.

[00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:47.260]
Don't keep putting yesterday's crap up there again on CNN.

[00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:50.760]
Give us today's explosions and today's dead people and body parts.

[00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:52.460]
Not stuff we already saw yesterday.

[00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:54.360]
Nobody cares about that anymore.

[00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:55.800]
We have a very short attention span.

[00:20:57.140 --> 00:20:58.100]
The lesbianese government.

[00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:00.860]
Vows not to let the assassination derailed their presidential vote.

[00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:02.140]
Well, good for those lesbianese.

[00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:03.840]
Like my lesbianese camp driver here.

[00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:04.840]
He's a good guy.

[00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:08.780]
Yep.

[00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:10.520]
In fact, I think what I tell you before the show.

[00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:12.380]
I think what I get my new car in the next couple of days.

[00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:15.020]
I'm going to park that baby right in his garage.

[00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:18.720]
Say, hey buddy, when I'm ready to drop it, I'll let you know.

[00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:20.220]
I don't want it anywhere near this building.

[00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:25.360]
972 votes and floodruckers continues kicking ass.

[00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:26.960]
So the best burger is 221.

[00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:29.680]
Charod, a very respectable second, 156.

[00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:31.880]
Which I'm sure Joel will be delighted to see that.

[00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:33.100]
And Kim Bebo came for two.

[00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:34.920]
One of our fine sponsors.

[00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:35.600]
I love Charod.

[00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:38.280]
I used to tell you when I come back from the doctor after I go take my.

[00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:40.400]
You have to be fasting for your blood tests.

[00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:41.020]
Yeah.

[00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:43.720]
So I go see the pill doctor, doctor, what it was named.

[00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:46.600]
Dr. Bob, Dr. Dick, whatever's named.

[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.200]
I go see him and then on the way back as soon as they finish drawing the blood.

[00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:50.820]
I'd stop.

[00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:52.400]
There was a Charod there in Laudahill.

[00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:53.920]
Not Laudahill, what is that?

[00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:56.460]
It's a Nod Hill road, what would that be?

[00:21:56.820 --> 00:21:57.320]
A sunrise?

[00:21:58.900 --> 00:21:59.440]
I don't know.

[00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:00.260]
I'm guessing that.

[00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:02.440]
Well, whatever it was, there's a nice Charod right there.

[00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:06.140]
And I'd go to the drive-thru and give me an ice Italian sausage with cheese and onion.

[00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:07.120]
Oh, baby.

[00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:09.140]
Well, that'll sit you free.

[00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:12.220]
Wendy's has 91, their third, steak and cake 84.

[00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:15.100]
Like Castle 74, Wayne Arles Royal Castle 73.

[00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:16.040]
They haven't forgot it.

[00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:17.520]
That's probably because it's our crowd.

[00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:18.920]
In and out, 73.

[00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:21.300]
Who don't like the old in and out?

[00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:25.120]
Checkers or Aralees 33, same stuff.

[00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:27.480]
Burger King 29, Hardy's 29.

[00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:32.620]
Crystal 24, Sonic 20, McDonald's 20, Jack in a box 16, etc.

[00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:36.020]
Vick and Irv still has only two and five guys has only one.

[00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:39.680]
What a burger, in spite of that, what's wrong with the love for what a burger, sir?

[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.280]
It's not in there, but even that Jack asked in vote for it.

[00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:44.940]
What biggest dinners of best talent?

[00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:46.180]
Here is your Roger.

[00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:48.600]
Watch all of your 5.60 QAM.

[00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:50.400]
Thanks, Force, Leader.

[00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:54.480]
Welcome down the hits with Casey Jason.

[00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:57.020]
Hi, I'm Casey Gaseum.

[00:22:57.280 --> 00:23:00.860]
Welcome back to our countdown of this week's top 20 ringdones.

[00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:03.780]
We're up to our number one ringdone of the week.

[00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:08.840]
But first, our unlimited coast to coast, long distance request and dedication.

[00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:10.760]
It's from Jessica S.

[00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:12.640]
She writes, Dear Casey.

[00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:17.120]
Recently, my sister was caught lip-sinking on national TV.

[00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:19.460]
At first, she blamed her band.

[00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:23.720]
And then, she blamed her asses re-flux, whatever that is.

[00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:28.140]
Anyway, Casey, since everyone thinks I'm the stupid one of the family,

[00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:32.480]
could you play Green Day's American idiot from my sister Ashley?

[00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:34.080]
Signed, Jessica.

[00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:36.640]
So, from Jessica to Ashley,

[00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:41.300]
here's your unlimited coast to coast, long distance request and dedication.

[00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:54.940]
That's American idiot from Jessica to Ashley.

[00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:56.600]
Now, on with the countdown.

[00:23:57.280 --> 00:24:00.060]
Casey's posted, just...

[00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:03.080]
But first, let's recap our top 3 ringdones.

[00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:03.940]
Number 3!

[00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:07.040]
Coming at it number 3, Rondo Aliterca by Mozart.

[00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:15.100]
Number 2!

[00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:19.220]
At number 2, that tune that sounds like heart and soul, but is it?

[00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:25.820]
And now, this week's number one ringdone.

[00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:26.720]
Number 1!

[00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:30.320]
For the third week in a row, walls of the flowers.

[00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:40.840]
Number 3!

[00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:43.900]
Here you have it, the top 20 ringdones of America,

[00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:46.580]
as tabulated by phone billboard magazine.

[00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:51.860]
To win again next week, when we'll once again count down America's top 20 ringdones.

[00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:55.060]
I'm Casey Casey saying keep your volume turned on,

[00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:57.060]
and keep reaching for Fort Bar.

[00:24:57.320 --> 00:24:59.400]
I think Casey's the parents of last minute.

[00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:04.420]
1033-27 before 11 at 5.50 W.D. Q.A.M.

[00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:05.300]
and we're getting on now.

[00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:07.840]
Somebody says George will agree, Rudy's, do you agree?

[00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:10.340]
Well, we both would have agreed at one point.

[00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:12.980]
I would have been at the time of Charm, when we were at IOD 100 years ago.

[00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:16.320]
Rudy's was right around the corner, they were in great aren't they were spectacular.

[00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:19.060]
They didn't last long enough for me to really get with it.

[00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:20.780]
Oh, it's too good to last long enough for it.

[00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:23.420]
If it's too good, people will stop for it, they don't mind if you do with it.

[00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:28.820]
But I did like the, you know, your own condiment that you could fix it up yourself and whatnot.

[00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:29.760]
Really?

[00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:30.660]
I'm throwing burgers.

[00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:31.520]
I never went inside.

[00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:32.760]
Yeah, Rudy's throwing burgers.

[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.240]
Rudy's good, get that on there.

[00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:38.880]
And somebody Jeff says don't forget, Jack's hamburger isn't on US-104 Lauderdale.

[00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:40.780]
Okay, we won't forget him, but I never heard him.

[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:41.220]
Did you?

[00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:41.520]
Nope.

[00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:42.980]
You ever hear him?

[00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:43.380]
Chris?

[00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:44.300]
Nope.

[00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:46.100]
But put it on there.

[00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:47.460]
Jack's hamburger is whatever.

[00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:51.160]
Hey, listen, we can have 50,000 a month and we'll get 50,000 votes.

[00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:52.080]
Each one will get a vote.

[00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:55.060]
But actually, it's only 1034 already.

[00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:59.380]
Already we got the 997 vote.

[00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:02.180]
Time I click this, baby, it might have a thousand already, you know what?

[00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:05.120]
By 1034, 998.

[00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:06.080]
Look at that, that's great.

[00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:08.200]
Nice go up Brandon, outstanding pull.

[00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:10.740]
I mean, we've done it, you know, a thousand times before, but that's okay.

[00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:12.420]
In fact, maybe we'll do it every day.

[00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:16.960]
And our never-ending quest to find the good eats, right?

[00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:21.840]
So we can let, don't forget we got lefties coming up on our, uh, Neal Deal, starting a noon today.

[00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:25.160]
Now we're never gonna break the record we've said last week.

[00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:26.040]
What was it, 9 minutes?

[00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:27.780]
I don't know.

[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:28.480]
Is that what it was?

[00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:28.900]
Be I.

[00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:31.640]
Was that a Chris, 9 minutes for last week?

[00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:31.900]

[00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:32.920]
Wow.

[00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:34.100]
I'm pretty impressed.

[00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:36.300]
You almost think we had an audience out there based on that.

[00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:39.340]
If I sound depressed and psychotic, that's because I am.

[00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:45.200]
Because working for Johnny Joe Bell is like, and it's like, uh, I'm trying to think,

[00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:50.020]
it would be like driving a cab and all the roads are closed.

[00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:52.140]
You know what I mean?

[00:26:52.660 --> 00:26:52.840]
Yeah.

[00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:57.400]
Your livelihood is driving a taxi, and there are all these people lined up who want to take a taxi to go somewhere.

[00:26:57.540 --> 00:26:59.940]
The only problem is all the roads are blocked. They're all closed.

[00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:03.420]
So no matter where you're going, you can't get there from here.

[00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:05.660]
So it's kind of an impediment.

[00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:07.780]
It's kind of like a roadblock for your success in doing it.

[00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:09.700]
And that's what we have here at WDQAM.

[00:27:10.060 --> 00:27:14.260]
We have Johnny Joe Bell, who has come in and just absolutely devastated.

[00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:17.400]
Yeah, I'm not talking dollars in sense because that's all they think about.

[00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:20.680]
Oh, well, yeah, we got the building up and we got record breaking right away.

[00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:22.200]
And the audience doesn't care about that.

[00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:27.720]
The audience isn't impressed by how much billing, by how many spots you can cram in there,

[00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:32.460]
like that hurricane crap we got later today from 3.30 until everybody is good sluffin.

[00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:36.200]
You know, until people can't hand, until people have hurricane coming out of every pore,

[00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:37.480]
wreck them their body, yeah.

[00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:40.700]
And that's basically what it's all about.

[00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:41.360]
That's all I know.

[00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:43.460]
Well, we're going to make some money for the beesleys, yeah.

[00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:47.120]
For the banjo strum and redneck yahoo, and the inner thal beesleys,

[00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:49.380]
we know a radio if you send them a carton full of them.

[00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:51.960]
Let's send them a carton full of cigarettes. Maybe they'll smoke them.

[00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:57.100]
Do you know, I like when I go into the convenience store here,

[00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:59.400]
there are people come in, of course, to buy their faggots in there.

[00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:01.660]
And it's like 10 bucks a pack of cigarettes now.

[00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:03.100]
And they don't even blink.

[00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:03.700]
No.

[00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:07.320]
And most of these people that are going in there, by the way, and buying their faggots,

[00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:10.720]
they're like not the most, yeah, and I'm gonna leave you all.

[00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:14.540]
In other words, how do I put a 10 bucks should be a lot to them?

[00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:14.880]

[00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:16.080]
Probably, right?

[00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:17.580]
That probably is.

[00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:21.560]
But these don't appear to be people with any enormous amount of discretionary income.

[00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:23.800]
And yet it's that being hooked again, like me on the sugar.

[00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:24.460]
When you're an addict.

[00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:26.980]
When you're addicted to that, that's right.

[00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:28.660]
Are you start with a drug talking again now?

[00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:28.860]
Yeah.

[00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:31.360]
Are you gonna start talking about people who snort heroin and things like that?

[00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:32.660]
No, people who snort sugar.

[00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:35.360]
Oh, now that's something I never thought about.

[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.520]
I just thought you could snort heroin.

[00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:38.400]
I never heard of that before.

[00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:40.840]
I thought you had to do the needle thing, like gin.

[00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:44.180]
Right, it was a new thing to me too when I first heard about it, although that was years ago.

[00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:47.460]
All you drug people, man, you just make this, I don't know.

[00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:49.740]
I mean, all you do is drug people.

[00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:54.060]
Well, it might be a hooked on sugar, it might be diabetic, and my blood sugar being just way, way high.

[00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:55.240]
I mean, just ridiculous.

[00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:58.260]
The drug that you're hooked on has caused me three people in my life.

[00:28:58.340 --> 00:29:01.260]
None of the other ones ever have, including alcohol or crap.

[00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:02.480]
I'm not gonna take any of them.

[00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:03.340]
I can't be in the snort and heroin.

[00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:04.400]
I wasn't, you were.

[00:29:04.540 --> 00:29:04.640]
Oh.

[00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:07.760]
I get nervous being around people like that.

[00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:08.400]
I am again.

[00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:09.500]
I don't know a good reason.

[00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:10.500]
Oh.

[00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:14.140]
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, really.

[00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:20.660]
A $70 million lawsuit filed by Dan Rather, religious that CBS has formed a parent company intentionally

[00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:25.060]
boxed the aftermath of a discredited story about President Bush's military service to

[00:29:25.060 --> 00:29:26.240]
Curry Favourow the administration.

[00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:27.140]
You go, Dan.

[00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:28.500]
Sue there, ugly ass.

[00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:31.340]
CBS, my ass.

[00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:37.360]
CBS spokesman Dan McClendon called Rather's complaints old news and said the lawsuit filed

[00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:39.800]
Wednesday in States of Pimport, Manhattan, was without merit.

[00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:43.340]
Former CBS parent company, Viacom, Inc., had no comment, their mum.

[00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:48.600]
The lawsuit claims Rather was made a scapegoat to placate the Bush administration after

[00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:53.120]
questions arose about the story, which concerned President Bush's military service, such as

[00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:54.420]
a was during the Vietnam War.

[00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:59.580]
A 75-year-old, rather, whose final months at CBS were clouded by controversy over the

[00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:04.180]
story, said the defendant's actions damages reputation and cost insignificantly, it was

[00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:06.980]
removed from CBS even news post in March 2005.

[00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:11.460]
I think the word we're looking for was unstermatically dumped.

[00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:18.380]
Besides CBS Corp and Viacom, the lawsuit names CBS Presidency or Leslie Moonbeer's Good,

[00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:20.800]
Sue his ugly ass, by the way, that little red lights on.

[00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:21.680]
OK?

[00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:24.360]
I don't know what that means, but just shut it off.

[00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:26.560]
It's disconnected, the dump thing.

[00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:30.020]
It's broken, but they're ever going to fix it.

[00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:32.900]
We don't need to because you're just so you know that you're in charge of that and that

[00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:35.660]
if anything gets on the air, that shouldn't get on the air, it's going to be your other

[00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:36.980]
is pretty much hitting it continuously.

[00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:38.300]
They're just keep hitting it.

[00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:41.620]
Or hook it up again and they'll just keep dumping, dump, dump, dump, dump, dump, dump,

[00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:42.100]
dump, dump, dump, dump, dump, dump, dump, dump, dump, dump, like that.

[00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:47.560]
Viacom Chairman, Senator Redstone and Andrew Hayward also got sued and the former president

[00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:52.220]
of CBS News Andy Hayward, the suit, the suit, the suit, $60 million in compensatory damages

[00:30:52.220 --> 00:30:57.060]
and 50 million imputed damages, you go get them, Danny Boy, stick it to them.

[00:30:57.920 --> 00:31:02.400]
Rather narrated the September 2000 report that said Bush dissimade orders and shook some

[00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:06.300]
of his duties during his National Guard service, which is well documented by the way, and

[00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:08.620]
that a commander felt pressured to sugarcoat Bush's record.

[00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:12.900]
In his lawsuit rather maintains the story was true, but says if any aspect of the broadcast

[00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:15.680]
was not accurate, he was not responsible for the errors.

[00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:21.340]
By forcing rather than to apologize publicly, CBS intentionally caused the public and the

[00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:26.000]
media to attribute CBS's alleged vulnerability of the episode to Mr. Rather to lawsuit claims.

[00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:31.120]
The story relied on four documents supposedly written by Bush's commander in Texas Air

[00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:35.480]
National Guard, Lieutenant Colonel Jerry Killian, critics questioned the documents authenticity

[00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:37.380]
and suggested they were forged and did it.

[00:31:38.420 --> 00:31:41.980]
CBS fired the story's producer, asked for the resignation of three executives because

[00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:43.880]
it couldn't authenticate documents used in the story.

[00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:48.680]
Rather was forced out of the anchor cherry and occupied for 24 years and then an inactive

[00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:53.720]
sheer lunacy and inactive self-suicide, the Admiral Halsey do suicide, but self-suicide,

[00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:58.760]
the lunatics brought in Katie Kirk, even Desperado's, even people in her family wouldn't

[00:31:58.760 --> 00:31:59.440]
watch that bitch.

[00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:01.400]
Remember there's assistance suicide.

[00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:03.060]
Oh yeah, that's right.

[00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:05.060]
Where's the Dr. Jack when we need him?

[00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:06.540]
I could use his services right now.

[00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:07.260]
No, no.

[00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:08.320]
I'm getting ready.

[00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:11.240]
You could use Luca Brotsey services, Dr. Jack.

[00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:15.260]
And investigating panel for the story selected by the network never concluded that the Killian

[00:32:15.260 --> 00:32:18.820]
documents were forged, or that the substance of the documents was inaccurate, and it did

[00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:22.500]
not question the underlying critical fact that President Bush had received preferential

[00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:24.240]
treatment related to the National Guard lawsuit.

[00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:29.060]
Richard Thornberg, the former US Attorney General, made up the two-man investigative panel

[00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:33.400]
with Lewis Bacardi, the retired chief executive of the AP, said he was unaware of Rathers'

[00:32:33.540 --> 00:32:33.780]
lawsuit.

[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:37.180]
Richard the stolen lawsuit, he said, only, our report speaks for itself.

[00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:40.320]
Bacardi didn't return messages left by the A&P.

[00:32:41.020 --> 00:32:42.540]
Lot of laws, though, he sent messages to.

[00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:43.820]
He said, hope they're in varied.

[00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:49.200]
Issued in January 2005, the 224-page report portrayed Rather as push to the limit with

[00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:53.500]
other stories at the time of the 60-Minutes Wednesday report, he relied on a trusted producer

[00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:57.480]
to not check the stir for accuracy, or apparently even see it before he introduced it on the

[00:32:57.480 --> 00:32:57.760]
program.

[00:32:58.580 --> 00:33:02.300]
CBS rushed the story on the year and then blindly defended it when holes became apparent

[00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:06.820]
said the panel, which was unable to say conclusively whether members allegedly is firing, disperaging

[00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:08.680]
Bush and service were real or fake.

[00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:10.320]
How they real or are they Memorax?

[00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:15.880]
The fired CBS news footage of Mary Meeves, a lot of cheese-kinder Ralph Meeves and Joe Meeves

[00:33:16.460 --> 00:33:18.880]
and Mark Meeves, the Meeves of Michigan.

[00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:23.660]
Later wrote to the panel's examination of the story read more like a prosecutorial

[00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:27.240]
brief than independent investigation for a book surrounded in controversy which published

[00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:28.180]
in 2005.

[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:33.420]
Rather moved on to a weekly news show on cable's HDNet channel than rather reports, but the

[00:33:33.420 --> 00:33:36.540]
effort is garnered little attention when the show lots of was available only in 4 million

[00:33:36.540 --> 00:33:39.880]
homes, a small fraction of his potential audience, while at CBS.

[00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:44.020]
We don't know where to see it, we don't where to find it, and when you come right down

[00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:44.360]
to it.

[00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:04.180]
This is Dan Rather for one of the final times reporting for CBS News.

[00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:09.440]
You may have heard that I will be leaving the network for which I served as news anchor

[00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:10.840]
for 24 years.

[00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:15.860]
CBS has basically told me there is no future for me there.

[00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:19.460]
Well, why the dog blew off my shoe and called me red butt?

[00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:20.800]
No future for me?

[00:34:21.380 --> 00:34:22.640]
No future for me?

[00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:26.580]
This from a network that hired a party girl to be their news anchor.

[00:34:27.220 --> 00:34:28.880]
I say baloney to you, sirs.

[00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:29.580]
Baloney.

[00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:35.560]
This Katie person drinks cheap champagne out of her stilettos while tabletop dancing

[00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:40.500]
and belting out karaoke, which I'm told is a Japanese influence singing style.

[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:41.940]
No future for me?

[00:34:42.540 --> 00:34:45.300]
I have been the face of that dump for more than three decades.

[00:34:46.020 --> 00:34:52.340]
Long before Survivor, CSI or the Monday Night Comedy Block, which actually blows, I was

[00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:52.760]
the king.

[00:34:53.380 --> 00:34:58.640]
Yet they have the audacity, the unmitigated goal, to tell me there is no future with them,

[00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:00.040]
no future for me.

[00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:03.920]
You make up a couple of stories about the president, suddenly your persona non-grata.

[00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:07.580]
How about that long-haired freak we had in the radio division for all those years?

[00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:12.580]
They rewarded him by sending him to a company where the cowciels had their own radio show.

[00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:17.460]
If you ask me, that's not too much vision for a company with an eyeball for a logo.

[00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:22.760]
Who could even believe that I, the great Dan Ruther, would become a body's uselessest

[00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:23.560]
boobs on a bowl?

[00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:28.680]
I guess the only way to ensure your future with this network is to cover oneself with body

[00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:30.600]
glitter and sleep with less moombas.

[00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:32.380]
For the record I tried.

[00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:35.660]
Less, was less than receptive.

[00:35:36.180 --> 00:35:39.560]
I have been forced to consider offers that quite frankly are beneath me.

[00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:45.060]
For example, a hosting job on the show, so you think he can dance in a new reality show

[00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:47.860]
called, Milking Cows with Celebrities.

[00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:51.760]
This reporter has rubbed shoulders with the greatest newsmakers of our time.

[00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:58.420]
Gorbachev, Brezhnev, Heidi Fleiss, and now I'm going on casting calls with Screech from

[00:35:58.420 --> 00:36:02.020]
saved by the bell whose own home is in foreclosure mode.

[00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:04.880]
Well, fire my skillet and wrap me in bacon.

[00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:09.600]
I won't take it laying down, unless of course less moombas reconsideres.

[00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:13.720]
Humiliated yes, embarrassed, certainly, but not dead.

[00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:15.240]
Not just yet.

[00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:18.400]
For now this is Dan Ruther signing off.

[00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:22.680]
I have a meeting with the people at sea-allys to become the new face of a reptile dysfunction.

[00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:26.960]
This reporter is in as much shock as Willi Nelson reading his text bill.

[00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:31.460]
But I say this here and now, I will not go quietly into that good night.

[00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:36.980]
I will maintain which left of my dignity, even if I am forced to endorse adult diapers.

[00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:40.300]
Dan Ruther reporting for, well, no one.

[00:36:40.580 --> 00:36:41.140]
In need.

[00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:43.980]
Instead of encouraging people to do that.

[00:36:43.980 --> 00:36:44.300]
There he is.

[00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:47.960]
There is your present and one of the worst sons of bitches who ever ever was on 1600

[00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:48.900]
Pennsylvania Avenue.

[00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:51.700]
Not as present, but just anybody that was on the street.

[00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:52.560]
You know what I mean?

[00:36:53.460 --> 00:36:53.960]
What do you mean?

[00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:55.880]
Not just 1600, but the entire street.

[00:36:55.880 --> 00:37:01.000]
One of the worst, the biggest butchers, murderers, liars, just incredible.

[00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:01.660]
Manglers.

[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:03.200]
Yeah, but let me ask you something.

[00:37:03.580 --> 00:37:05.980]
You think that OJ thinks that he's above the law.

[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:07.960]
Best burger in town.

[00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:09.140]
Here's two of them on this one.

[00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:09.560]
Facts.

[00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:12.160]
Duffy's Tavern read Road North to Crowley.

[00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:12.860]
Never heard of it.

[00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:13.720]
And Flanagan.

[00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:14.100]
Good place.

[00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:15.320]
Which one?

[00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:15.600]
Duffy?

[00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:17.540]
Duffy's Tavern.

[00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:18.280]
Get it on there, then.

[00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:19.860]
Chris, you're the one doing all the talking.

[00:37:21.100 --> 00:37:23.540]
And to Flanagan's, which of course is primarily it.

[00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:26.640]
A lot of times a place is where you're the best burger.

[00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:28.480]
You know, just because they have a bar there.

[00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:31.260]
No, that's a lot of times a joint.

[00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:32.500]
The best burgers are in a joint.

[00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:33.000]
That's right.

[00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:38.600]
That's what my late uncle Marvin Rosen told me as he was on his deathbed, but close to

[00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:38.720]
it.

[00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:40.960]
Last time I saw him, the best burgers are in a joint.

[00:37:41.740 --> 00:37:44.620]
And then he was telling me how much he loved those little hot fights Sundays in McDonald's.

[00:37:44.780 --> 00:37:47.220]
This is a guy that was worth like 50, 60 million maybe more.

[00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:50.620]
But he loved those little hot fights Sundays in McDonald's.

[00:37:50.620 --> 00:37:52.020]
And the best burgers are in a joint.

[00:37:53.380 --> 00:37:56.480]
Maybe that's why George is always in a joint or with one, right?

[00:37:57.600 --> 00:37:59.440]
We got a thousand twenty eight votes on the pool.

[00:37:59.540 --> 00:38:02.640]
I think Chris would be screaming and carrying on like a lunatic right now.

[00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:05.200]
Yeah, I got to conserve energy a long day today.

[00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:05.940]
Oh, yeah.

[00:38:06.020 --> 00:38:09.320]
Well, when you're fat like you are, you might burn a couple of calories off.

[00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:11.540]
And I know that with all this food talk on here.

[00:38:12.660 --> 00:38:13.000]
And let's see.

[00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:14.280]
What a burger finally got one.

[00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:17.100]
And it must be from whoever sent me that hostile, caustic facts.

[00:38:17.100 --> 00:38:19.080]
Where is the love for one of our burgers?

[00:38:19.180 --> 00:38:19.440]
Sir.

[00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:22.700]
To sir with love.

[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.520]
Anyway, we got a thousand thirty two votes.

[00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:30.420]
And the Fudruckers continues just kick an ass to two hundred and thirty five Charhot

[00:38:30.420 --> 00:38:31.140]
one sixty five.

[00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:34.940]
That's where the battle is those two back and forth up and down in and out.

[00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:36.160]
Oh, in and out Scott 78.

[00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:40.580]
Wendy's is third steak and shake forth in and out and then white castle and art and

[00:38:40.580 --> 00:38:42.700]
zero castle close by each and after that.

[00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:44.620]
It's a big drop down way down.

[00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:52.020]
So I would say basically there are like three or five six seven, seven joints and

[00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:52.980]
Georgia smoke them all.

[00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:54.300]
So what do you think?

[00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:55.420]
I said, I'm gonna drugs your one.

[00:38:55.580 --> 00:38:57.480]
I could for your heart when you're diabetic and old.

[00:38:57.540 --> 00:38:58.260]
No, I blood pressure.

[00:38:58.260 --> 00:38:59.560]
No, it's not.

[00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:01.160]
What drugs should I start doing?

[00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:04.340]
I highly recommend marijuana if you are going to choose one.

[00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:07.000]
I don't even consider that a drug.

[00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:08.080]
Well, that's a plant.

[00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:09.560]
Well, that's a plant exactly.

[00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:10.740]
I poppy.

[00:39:10.860 --> 00:39:11.920]
Oh, that's something else.

[00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:13.020]
Not seriously.

[00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:13.880]
I'm not.

[00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:14.440]
I'm not.

[00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:17.040]
I'm not going to recommend something harmful or addictive to you.

[00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:17.520]
Why not?

[00:39:17.700 --> 00:39:18.820]
Because I love you.

[00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:22.800]
But you're in the will.

[00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:24.940]
But then so were a lot of other people.

[00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:28.540]
You know, you're worth more to me alive than dead no matter how much money you stick

[00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:29.020]
in their house.

[00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:29.180]
Really?

[00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:29.600]
Yes.

[00:39:31.260 --> 00:39:32.100]
What does that mean?

[00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:34.080]
I mean, I'd rather have you alive.

[00:39:34.540 --> 00:39:35.940]
Well, wait till tomorrow morning at 10 o'clock.

[00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:37.220]
You may change your mind about that.

[00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:41.820]
I have great preparation as we're losing a really good month and their may is dropping

[00:39:41.820 --> 00:39:42.060]
off.

[00:39:42.260 --> 00:39:43.820]
Yeah, tune was a nightmare.

[00:39:43.820 --> 00:39:45.020]
You're a wild too.

[00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:45.320]
Sorry.

[00:39:46.020 --> 00:39:46.820]
My bad.

[00:39:47.420 --> 00:39:48.520]
No, not your bad.

[00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:49.980]
Joe Bell's bad.

[00:39:50.220 --> 00:39:52.600]
Don't take, listen, don't take the rap for any crap we get.

[00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:57.260]
I'll take the rap for the back in the day before he came and put his ugly stamp on his face.

[00:39:57.480 --> 00:40:01.280]
We used to consistently just kick big fat, smudgy, nasty pimpley ass.

[00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:05.200]
Now, since he's got along the whole station, he's gone into tank in the toilet like

[00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:05.740]
more with some.

[00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:06.440]
No, no, no, no.

[00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:09.340]
What is wrong with you, jolly?

[00:40:09.420 --> 00:40:10.780]
Joe, and this is a guy you can't talk to.

[00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:11.800]
You can't tell him anything.

[00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:13.420]
Oh, I don't know what to tell you.

[00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:20.360]
And then they fired McGellen and the guy that replaced him that they stabbed him in the

[00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:20.880]
back with.

[00:40:21.140 --> 00:40:22.900]
McGell goes across the street who is a good guy.

[00:40:23.060 --> 00:40:23.760]
You can also run a board.

[00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:25.200]
And by the way, what's the story, Jerry?

[00:40:25.580 --> 00:40:27.380]
Chris, you run the board for 20 hours to there?

[00:40:27.540 --> 00:40:27.840]
Yes.

[00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:31.840]
And that's because McGell is not there anymore.

[00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:33.700]
And it's a deep spit that they hired to.

[00:40:33.820 --> 00:40:35.660]
He's already gone because he wanted more money.

[00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:39.020]
Nice move again, jolly, jolly.

[00:40:39.020 --> 00:40:40.400]
You just keep making a mistake.

[00:40:40.700 --> 00:40:44.140]
After mistake, after mistake, after mistake, it's just unbelievable.

[00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:49.960]
People who visit developing companies may soon be able to avoid a dreaded companion,

[00:40:50.860 --> 00:40:51.820]
Traver's Diarrhea.

[00:40:52.620 --> 00:40:53.940]
Oh, oh my god.

[00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:57.900]
With the aid of a vaccine, it's being tested in the state led by Houston doctor.

[00:40:58.060 --> 00:41:00.180]
I thought this story would be very appropriate for today.

[00:41:00.180 --> 00:41:03.700]
I'll tell you who gives me diarrhea this and oh my god, just looking at him.

[00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:06.700]
I just want to go in here and do a wicked dump.

[00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:08.880]
But this is good.

[00:41:09.020 --> 00:41:09.620]
It fits right in.

[00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:14.920]
In fact, that would be a good poll to take one day, which fast food joint gives you the

[00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:17.420]
wildest wild screaming diarrhea.

[00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:22.400]
The vaccine delivered through a skin patch rather than the needle is expected to underface

[00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:24.020]
three of its clinical trial next year.

[00:41:24.340 --> 00:41:29.280]
If it wins a pool from the FDA, it will be the first medication to prevent Traver's Diarrhea.

[00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:31.440]
Absolutely correction.

[00:41:32.820 --> 00:41:33.160]
Remember that.

[00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:35.980]
You probably don't remember the first spot was the forpeptobizmal.

[00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:38.580]
At the end of the spots, I do love forpeptobizmal.

[00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:39.380]
Other ones where they go.

[00:41:41.100 --> 00:41:43.260]
They got the singing peeple.

[00:41:43.580 --> 00:41:46.920]
The heartburn, indigestion, diarrhea.

[00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:47.560]
Yeah, indigestion.

[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:50.520]
We all sing along in my house.

[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:55.800]
Heartburn, nausea, indigestion, upset stomach, diarrhea, yeah.

[00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:56.180]
It rocks.

[00:41:56.580 --> 00:41:57.600]
We get up and dance.

[00:41:59.320 --> 00:42:02.680]
The skin patch is a focus of a state led by Dr. Herbert DuPont.

[00:42:02.980 --> 00:42:05.760]
I wonder if he's kind of Donald DuPont who couldn't drive his finger up his nose.

[00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:10.620]
A professor at the University of Texas School of Public Health DuPont, director of the School

[00:42:10.620 --> 00:42:14.500]
Center for Infectious Diseases, presented the results of the vaccine's face to clinical

[00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:16.820]
trial of a conference in Chicago Tuesday.

[00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:22.380]
Travellers who received the vaccine before trips to Mexico or Guatemala were significantly

[00:42:22.380 --> 00:42:26.340]
less likely to fall ill with Travellers Diarrhea than those who received placebo as he

[00:42:26.340 --> 00:42:26.700]
reported.

[00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:30.680]
We may be near a turning point of the prevention of this common-off and serious disease

[00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:34.940]
DuPont said, the unique aspects of putting a patch on the skin that protects you against

[00:42:34.940 --> 00:42:36.580]
the common disease is very exciting.

[00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:42.840]
Wow, a patch on the skin that protects you against Travellers Diarrhea and maybe against

[00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:45.820]
the dump in your pants like I didn't answer them a few months ago.

[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:46.540]
That was bad.

[00:42:47.460 --> 00:42:48.500]
That was not good.

[00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:53.360]
He said he wouldn't find the name Keith Beer Room there, the hotel room.

[00:42:53.460 --> 00:42:54.940]
Whatever, stand there, fumbling around.

[00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:57.120]
Oh, he's wearing that nose for a summer.

[00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:06.400]
Oh no, I got a piece for now.

[00:43:10.100 --> 00:43:11.180]
I feel better now.

[00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:11.780]
I'm good.

[00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:12.900]
I'm ready.

[00:43:13.020 --> 00:43:15.840]
I hope to finish phase 3, the final level of testing in 2009.

[00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:20.180]
Travellers Diarrhea is the most common illness affecting people who visit developing nations.

[00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:23.660]
What does that term mean, developing nations?

[00:43:24.700 --> 00:43:26.160]
I mean, it just mentioned Mexico, Guatemala.

[00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:28.740]
Have those countries been around a long time?

[00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:30.460]
I mean, they're still developing.

[00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:31.800]
No, developing what?

[00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:32.700]
Into something.

[00:43:33.940 --> 00:43:38.360]
Between 20 and 50% of international travelers are about 10 million people develop Travellers

[00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:39.200]
Diarrhea each year.

[00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:42.700]
The agency says, don't be in the onion soup with that restaurant and empty them on the

[00:43:42.700 --> 00:43:43.120]
dam rack.

[00:43:43.340 --> 00:43:43.800]
The market.

[00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:46.320]
The market is a little demurkey these days.

[00:43:47.140 --> 00:43:48.220]
They're good pizza though.

[00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:53.480]
The illness usually is caused by food to drink that's been contended by feces.

[00:43:53.900 --> 00:43:56.320]
Oh no, by Jim de Feseese.

[00:43:58.220 --> 00:43:59.860]
Geez, I never knew that before.

[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:00.500]
Did you know that?

[00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:01.040]
No.

[00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:01.960]
Wow.

[00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:06.980]
The skin patch vaccine to identify eye-omé corporations designed to prevent Diarrhea caused

[00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:12.960]
by entero-toxogenic E. coli bacteria, the most common cause of Travellers Diarrhea.

[00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:19.020]
It immunizes the recipients of toxic produce by the bacteria, similarly, tendous vaccine.

[00:44:19.420 --> 00:44:21.180]
I just can't even speak after reading that one line.

[00:44:21.300 --> 00:44:25.740]
The illness is usually caused by food or drink that's been contended by feces.

[00:44:26.260 --> 00:44:33.420]
Oh, symptoms include loser watery stool, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramping, and fever.

[00:44:33.860 --> 00:44:35.500]
Don't fall off that watery stool.

[00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:39.380]
It's rarely life-threatening but can cause serious discomfort and inconvenience.

[00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:41.720]
Most cases result within several days without treatment.

[00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:45.420]
At risk of those people who have been developing countries in Latin America, Africa, the Middle

[00:44:45.420 --> 00:44:48.240]
East, and Asia, they're developing with them very slowly.

[00:44:48.680 --> 00:44:52.420]
Young adults and people with compromised immune systems including those with diabetes

[00:44:52.960 --> 00:44:53.440]
are at high risk.

[00:44:53.660 --> 00:44:54.960]
See there, I just learned something right there.

[00:44:55.260 --> 00:45:00.200]
Phase 2 of the trial involved 170 travelers to Mexico and Guatemala who received two doses

[00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:03.980]
of meat that the vaccine were placebo before their trips of the 59 people who received

[00:45:03.980 --> 00:45:04.400]
the vaccine.

[00:45:04.660 --> 00:45:09.700]
5% suffered from moderate or severe diarrhea compared with 21% of the 111 people who received

[00:45:09.700 --> 00:45:10.220]
the placebo.

[00:45:10.700 --> 00:45:13.980]
No vaccine-related serious adverse effects were reported.

[00:45:14.600 --> 00:45:17.280]
Although when we see him, we're saying there should be the passage as well.

[00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:22.080]
No, all while we all get wild screaming, he'd be so used to the best town.

[00:45:27.380 --> 00:45:29.420]
This is the Neolonger Show.

[00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:31.280]
This is the Neolonger Show.

[00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:32.120]
This is the Brain.

[00:45:33.700 --> 00:45:34.180]
Dordordordord.

[00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:35.100]
Any question?

[00:45:35.860 --> 00:45:38.820]
It was the dumbest heist in Las Vegas history.

[00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:42.860]
Hundreds of dollars worth of meaningless poor home memorabilia was for the taking.

[00:45:43.300 --> 00:45:46.820]
And a plan that came together for OJ's 11.

[00:45:49.060 --> 00:45:51.740]
I don't know why you just don't ask for this stuff back.

[00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:53.400]
Those jokes to me!

[00:45:53.700 --> 00:45:54.260]
Not anymore!

[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:56.400]
Don't rip the fence foot!

[00:45:56.780 --> 00:45:57.280]
What's that?

[00:45:58.280 --> 00:45:58.860]
We...

[00:45:58.860 --> 00:45:59.680]
Screw it on you!

[00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:03.080]
Now let's just go ahead and do it!

[00:46:03.140 --> 00:46:03.740]
How about you?

[00:46:06.580 --> 00:46:06.980]
You...

[00:46:06.980 --> 00:46:06.980]

[00:46:06.980 --> 00:46:07.520]
You're free, OJ!

[00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:08.600]
You're free, so...

[00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:08.600]

[00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:10.000]
It just breaks us off me!

[00:46:10.380 --> 00:46:13.040]
Two days to know the time of officer, I'll just pay the race!

[00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:14.300]
Cod again and go free!

[00:46:14.680 --> 00:46:15.760]
He's not a point, Joe.

[00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:17.720]
That memorabilia belongs to me!

[00:46:18.020 --> 00:46:20.420]
It was given to me by my Don'tin fan!

[00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:20.940]
Yeah.

[00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:22.900]
You'll have plenty of fans where you're going, Mr.

[00:46:23.220 --> 00:46:24.640]
We had that back to Florida.

[00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:29.200]
Oh, that's it?

[00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:34.260]
I guess it surprised me too. I was reading about Jim DeFese's here. When a

[00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:38.160]
Harold fired his ass, there's a big, oh yeah, it's amazing the stuff you find

[00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:42.580]
online. Just I know that's you know, obviously most people with a brain. But it

[00:46:42.580 --> 00:46:46.100]
just is amazing. I never ceased to be amazed. Maybe that's a better way to put it.

[00:46:46.300 --> 00:46:51.060]
Okay. You ceased to be amazed? I'm amazed all the time. I try not to be. Maybe I'm

[00:46:51.060 --> 00:46:55.640]
amazed. But you play that. An open letter to Harold.

[00:46:56.620 --> 00:47:01.580]
Harold, the publisher from a whole bunch of people, a whole bunch of newspaper

[00:47:01.580 --> 00:47:07.200]
people. Mostly Harold alumni. There's like 80's in and people. And it led to

[00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:11.160]
publisher Jesus Diaz and editor Tom Feeder, you know Tom with the yellow rain coat

[00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:14.800]
that was busy chasing around Gary Hart and Donna ain't so nice rice. Remember

[00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:20.200]
those days? Uh-huh. I sure do. Little twirpy Tom Feeder from the 90's. Hey Tom,

[00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:23.680]
head him on my show one time with Carl Heist and blow it was at a bad show. Was it

[00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:28.020]
a good suck? Anyway, I think the crystal to be pretty happy although

[00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:32.900]
running a country is running a country is busy is running a country it's hard work.

[00:47:33.260 --> 00:47:39.120]
Running a country. We are really kicking ass on this burger pull. Thanks Brandon. I'm

[00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:43.120]
gonna like Brandon to do the pull every day now. Of course now he's gonna have to come

[00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:47.600]
up with one for tomorrow. He sent me a, oh there also used to be burger queen. Let's

[00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:51.820]
put that on there too. That's right. I forgot about that burger green. Yeah.

[00:47:51.820 --> 00:47:55.540]
It was very similar to burger chef in that they had the fixings bar and you put your own

[00:47:55.540 --> 00:48:00.800]
toppings on it and stuff like that and they had the like onion slices and all the good stuff.

[00:48:00.860 --> 00:48:06.480]
Yeah, I like those things. Yeah. Although it does help if the meat is edible. You know like

[00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:10.080]
Harvey's yeah that's a good place to start. Yeah that's a good place to start. I mean in

[00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:17.220]
2009 we're gonna have 1100 votes at 1105. There's, I've met you with mind up with 65,000

[00:48:17.220 --> 00:48:21.440]
votes on a pull today which maybe that's a sign somebody's coming back and maybe we're

[00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:26.100]
gonna be amazed or not. I think we're gonna be amazed tomorrow morning around 1015.

[00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:32.840]
When the evidence is in boy I think it's gonna be grim. I don't usually predict on those things

[00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:37.760]
just how the hell do you know. You know, you know, I don't predict but my prediction is it's

[00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:42.400]
gonna be grim and slim and really I wouldn't be surprised if this station's got some hours

[00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:46.100]
the word the number starts with a like he used to do across the street and by the way Joe will

[00:48:46.100 --> 00:48:50.500]
find burger screw you. Now you threatened me that there was gonna be some article from Jolly

[00:48:50.500 --> 00:48:55.280]
Joe that he sent along and I gave the magazine to Bocher Brian and you'll get it next week. I

[00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:59.480]
won't get it next week. I thought was gonna be in the package yesterday. Well, no pressure.

[00:49:00.020 --> 00:49:03.820]
Literally disappointed I couldn't wait to read about what a jackass at Joel Feinberg is although

[00:49:03.820 --> 00:49:07.320]
I don't need to read about it because I already know it from personal experience or real jerk

[00:49:07.320 --> 00:49:12.560]
or real goofball or real not or not another non-radio person. Well he told us when he called it and he

[00:49:12.560 --> 00:49:16.260]
doesn't know anything about radio and he doesn't know anything about sports. All he knows is his dad

[00:49:16.260 --> 00:49:21.060]
he's got a lot of money and he knows how to spend it. It's all he knows and that he's full of crap

[00:49:21.060 --> 00:49:27.140]
and that Jolly Joe Bells an easy target man. 1101 on the pull we went over 1100 votes now in the burger

[00:49:27.140 --> 00:49:30.820]
pool see and you were not gonna see other day you're so oh jeez we've done it so many times.

[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:36.820]
Yeah, there's eye sanding. I think both of us were saying it's good. It's all good. It's all good.

[00:49:36.980 --> 00:49:40.800]
That's that's a good point. That's what Fubba says. It's all good. Just another bubble-micing

[00:49:42.820 --> 00:49:45.840]
and Fubruckers this is way out ahead of the pack so I guess quite a brand and they

[00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:50.420]
struck that one down because they had some health violations and health department struck that one

[00:49:50.420 --> 00:49:58.960]
down. Well I wonder what that was all about. I mean that was there a long time because I've been

[00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:03.820]
I've lived in plantation for oh I don't know I'd say about 600 years and I remember one that

[00:50:03.820 --> 00:50:07.900]
thing went up there and now it's gone. See that that's the way it is in life. The good places they

[00:50:07.900 --> 00:50:13.180]
come in and they go and say oh jeez whatever happened to you know whatever right although nowadays you

[00:50:13.180 --> 00:50:17.600]
can't say whatever because now that has a different connotation. Well whatever. Huh? Well no

[00:50:18.380 --> 00:50:26.080]
whatever. No no no. The best burgers come from Fubruckers 239, Charhot 171. I think Charot could

[00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:31.240]
still pass them. I like Charot Lepa but I don't think I've ever had burgers there because when I

[00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:34.460]
go there I always want the sausage or weenies or something like that. But I heard yes.

[00:50:35.940 --> 00:50:43.160]
Especially the Italian sausage that's my favorite. I heard that. But in any rate Charot 171

[00:50:43.180 --> 00:50:47.320]
so I never had the Char cheese and of course I was great. When I was there are they are they really?

[00:50:47.420 --> 00:50:51.740]
Yes. I always remember different people on our station just raping about them and that's probably

[00:50:51.740 --> 00:50:54.640]
because they were getting them for free. Somebody had already voted on the poll when I got here this

[00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:59.380]
morning but I would have voted for Charhot if I could have. Somebody already voted on our poll

[00:50:59.380 --> 00:51:03.540]
this morning. I like that. They're here in the building. I don't know. Not yo. Or maybe yesterday

[00:51:03.540 --> 00:51:09.320]
afternoon. Well how can you change that? Who knows. Already means somebody there in the building

[00:51:09.320 --> 00:51:13.860]
so you can vote. Right. Because that's the way this stupid thing works. For anybody who wonders

[00:51:13.860 --> 00:51:19.560]
why we get relatively so few. Now how come? Well it's like you go on CNN polls and they've got like

[00:51:19.560 --> 00:51:27.880]
53,000 votes or like 200 MSNBC, 243,000 votes, stuff like that. Of course when we get like

[00:51:27.880 --> 00:51:31.860]
1500 votes that's a real feather in our cap because it means it's possible 1500 people might

[00:51:31.860 --> 00:51:38.740]
actually be listening. Might. You understand. We'll find out tomorrow. Thanks a lot by the way,

[00:51:38.740 --> 00:51:43.040]
Johnny Joe for making my final months in South Florida and this whole 31 and a half years I've

[00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:47.700]
been on. Thanks for making it a living nightmare. Okay, Johnny Joe. What you have done. I'll say it

[00:51:47.700 --> 00:51:52.160]
again and I really mean this. This isn't sick. There are people on death row for lesser crimes than

[00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:57.020]
what you've done to this once proud radio station. You are a butcher, a lunatic, a maniac.

[00:51:57.800 --> 00:52:01.920]
I saw it was time to come together a couple years ago. Yeah well he'll be. Yeah.

[00:52:04.180 --> 00:52:09.440]
Did I read the char hot 171 when these 99 so the others after those top two aren't in the running

[00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:15.180]
although you're something might be running down your leg but when these 99, stake in shake 89 they

[00:52:15.180 --> 00:52:19.800]
got the best shakes. That will be tomorrow's poll who's got the best shakes. Yeah,

[00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:25.440]
Nareena wins I think. I voted for Michael J. Fox. Oh I knew you'd do that. There was no down in my

[00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:30.140]
mind. Bad taste. Got the best shakes. That is so insensitive and cruel but accurate.

[00:52:30.980 --> 00:52:37.840]
When these 99 stake in take 89 in and out 80 old in and out. I've seen that and in fact you

[00:52:37.840 --> 00:52:41.200]
know where it isn't Vegas. Well there's probably more than one but there's one like right on the

[00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:47.060]
highway there and it ended out burger. Yeah and because everybody was always calling into the show

[00:52:47.060 --> 00:52:50.880]
saying well you got to try that they're great. I've often thought about trying that but since I'm

[00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:56.380]
never going to go back to Vegas I guess I'm never going to get to try it. Either of you ever try it?

[00:52:56.380 --> 00:53:03.480]
Nope. Arles Road Castle 79, White Castle 79, Rudeys which went on late is all the way up to 40.

[00:53:03.960 --> 00:53:07.960]
Wow what a feather in air cap. Of course they're quite a good memory in their in their cap too.

[00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:12.360]
No that's how good it was. Rudeys was like you said they were like a stake burger. They called it.

[00:53:12.360 --> 00:53:19.060]
Too good to last and they worked. Something 41 votes now. Rudeys was great and many a day when I'd

[00:53:19.060 --> 00:53:22.020]
leave I would either to a flank or of course there was one of those days when we didn't have

[00:53:22.020 --> 00:53:26.140]
any food coming which is pretty unusual but many a day if there wasn't no food I would

[00:53:26.140 --> 00:53:29.760]
drive up there I'm this game full of art and whip right into Rudeys baby and go into the drive

[00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:37.100]
through and eat that baby on the way home. Of course now you can't eat the bun when you got

[00:53:37.100 --> 00:53:43.300]
die babies. At least you shouldn't you know see that's the thing the bread like last night I went

[00:53:43.300 --> 00:53:48.700]
to a restaurant I had a meal all by my own semi-sant there and I had bread and I eat the bread

[00:53:48.700 --> 00:53:52.760]
I didn't order the bread but you know and I had lasagna neither one of which I should be eating.

[00:53:55.200 --> 00:53:59.740]
I'm too disgusted and wrote to you. Yeah I am I keep my mouth shut. What do you mean by that?

[00:53:59.960 --> 00:54:03.820]
I shouldn't be in the lasagna. I certainly shouldn't be in the bread. I don't eat. I'm not even

[00:54:03.820 --> 00:54:08.380]
that crazy about bread like in Faso where he says you know you love bread I like bread. I like it

[00:54:08.380 --> 00:54:12.360]
okay especially if it's fresh and warm you know like in Ruth Chris to bring out that hot loaf

[00:54:12.360 --> 00:54:16.260]
and yeah nothing like a hot loaf and then they in some places they got that garlic butter.

[00:54:17.420 --> 00:54:23.380]
Mmm that's a regular butter but like garlic butter. Man in fact I had a double chicken breast

[00:54:23.380 --> 00:54:27.140]
Saturday night at Ruth Chris had a double chicken breast filled with stuffed with garlic butter.

[00:54:27.540 --> 00:54:31.840]
That sounds great. Oh man that was so good and of course I'm sure it's like like

[00:54:31.840 --> 00:54:37.020]
Feta Tinele Frater like heart attack on a plate. But nevertheless it was damn good.

[00:54:37.540 --> 00:54:41.060]
Something to be said for a good meal and the Ruth Chris here by the way is a much better

[00:54:41.060 --> 00:54:46.900]
well I shouldn't say that. Then some other ones. Is that it was that a delicate way of putting it?

[00:54:47.800 --> 00:54:51.840]
Yeah. The one here is really sensational. It's in the Hilton hotel by the way when you come

[00:54:51.840 --> 00:54:55.580]
to visit Toronto which you won't because your dollar isn't worth like a buck and a half like

[00:54:55.580 --> 00:54:59.360]
he used to be or buck 30. In fact I should go over to that channel right now and then I'll kill

[00:54:59.360 --> 00:55:03.940]
myself after I see that it's finally achieved. I mean this happened like all of a sudden.

[00:55:05.680 --> 00:55:11.340]
One so in that interest rate cut when a 99.87 a Canadian dollar for loony.

[00:55:12.340 --> 00:55:18.860]
The loony baby is 99.86 now. Thank God I moved back down just to touch just to hear a scooch.

[00:55:19.920 --> 00:55:24.260]
Oh brother thanks so much Hilton. You bow so you you booger.

[00:55:24.260 --> 00:55:27.900]
What biggest name? The best town. He's no Roger.

[00:55:27.900 --> 00:55:32.200]
Forty five sixty QAM. The fourth leader.

[00:55:32.720 --> 00:55:38.640]
Hey hey kids. This year's hottest toy is here prepared to be bamboozled by the

[00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:44.820]
battling bosos of Rockham Sucker Rock Tard. Hey man and Kid Rock.

[00:55:45.280 --> 00:55:51.000]
And I'm Tommy Lee. Pay Anderson for longs to me man.

[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:52.280]
Pams 9.

[00:55:57.660 --> 00:56:01.120]
Dude you knocked my block off.

[00:56:01.220 --> 00:56:02.980]
Rockham Sucker Rock Tard.

[00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:07.280]
Available now at a crappy music awards show near you.

[00:56:07.860 --> 00:56:11.140]
Look at that. Routies has got 43 votes.

[00:56:12.180 --> 00:56:15.820]
See we keep talking about the ones at the top of this pool. Let's uh

[00:56:15.820 --> 00:56:19.420]
fat burgers got a who? Fat burger.

[00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:24.640]
Okay. The chef has got six planning against four jacks four.

[00:56:24.980 --> 00:56:29.400]
What a burger four? Vick and Earth's four. Five guys three. I never heard of it.

[00:56:29.700 --> 00:56:32.900]
Me either. Cotton now three. Well the fact cotton now has got three votes.

[00:56:33.020 --> 00:56:35.320]
So it's enough to make you cry.

[00:56:35.480 --> 00:56:37.420]
Speaking of the hot and now lefties is here now.

[00:56:38.100 --> 00:56:40.200]
Well good. I can't wait. I bet it's hot.

[00:56:40.380 --> 00:56:41.660]
All this food talk you know.

[00:56:41.660 --> 00:56:44.400]
Duffies tavern two and burger queens just went on. I don't have any.

[00:56:44.860 --> 00:56:47.520]
1128 votes. Have it your chris is like dancing in the streets.

[00:56:47.520 --> 00:56:50.120]
Not because we got a lot of votes but because the free food just showed up.

[00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:53.560]
Yes. I'm like 43 minutes to go until we get to um

[00:56:54.680 --> 00:56:58.180]
noon and then we go through that very exciting exercise and see how fast.

[00:56:58.360 --> 00:57:01.220]
Now how many have we got today? We have 50?

[00:57:02.100 --> 00:57:06.840]
100 I believe. We got 150 and that's right because these are 50s.

[00:57:06.900 --> 00:57:09.960]
When we have 50 ounces of it gets for 25 bucks then we have 100.

[00:57:10.640 --> 00:57:14.000]
So that'll take probably more than like 10 20 seconds to sell those.

[00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:18.740]
Yale glider was angry yesterday as he stroked from a Las Vegas courtroom to the

[00:57:18.740 --> 00:57:22.740]
gaggle reporters waiting outside. The long time I'm a defense lawyer

[00:57:22.740 --> 00:57:25.900]
had just succeeded in getting his star client OJ Simpson released from jail

[00:57:25.900 --> 00:57:29.640]
pending a raiment on robbery and kidnapping charges just after mid-night a US

[00:57:29.640 --> 00:57:32.780]
air flight touched down in Fort Lauderdale with Simpson aboard on route to his

[00:57:32.780 --> 00:57:35.460]
home in Kendall. Oh boy. Oh my god.

[00:57:35.460 --> 00:57:38.600]
Amen. Simpson offered no comment left the airport in a

[00:57:38.600 --> 00:57:41.300]
Ford excursion. You thought I was going to say an

[00:57:41.300 --> 00:57:43.740]
Ford Bronco? Yeah.

[00:57:43.860 --> 00:57:47.380]
And said actually but glider 51 wasn't pleased.

[00:57:48.060 --> 00:57:50.600]
I'm living it actually. He said earlier Wednesdays he stomped through the

[00:57:50.600 --> 00:57:53.680]
courthouse. The reason several TV stations that

[00:57:53.680 --> 00:57:56.420]
are interviews with the local lawyer claimed he was representing Simpson free

[00:57:56.420 --> 00:58:00.100]
of charge. Glider put an end to that when he defiantly announced in court yesterday

[00:58:00.100 --> 00:58:03.500]
that he and a Vegas lawyer he hand picked to assist him would be the only

[00:58:03.500 --> 00:58:07.740]
attorneys for the defense. I know it seemed like a Joe Pesky movie in there

[00:58:07.740 --> 00:58:11.000]
glider said afterward but I was really angry I needed to make clear that

[00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:13.760]
worthy only through lawyers representing Mr. Simpson.

[00:58:15.520 --> 00:58:18.240]
Glider may have been understandably upset that someone else was trying to

[00:58:18.240 --> 00:58:22.080]
claim to his clients since 2000. Glider has been Simpson's primary lawyer

[00:58:22.080 --> 00:58:26.680]
in spokesman. Glider was so intent on being in Las Vegas for

[00:58:26.680 --> 00:58:29.980]
Simpson's bail. He has to bribe Kelly Judge to postpone a rape

[00:58:29.980 --> 00:58:33.320]
trial he's working on there. The accuser in the rape case who lives in Kentucky

[00:58:33.320 --> 00:58:36.480]
already traveled to South Florida for the court case only learned it was off

[00:58:36.480 --> 00:58:39.380]
because the attorney for a alleged attacker had to attend to OJ.

[00:58:40.700 --> 00:58:43.720]
I'm not going to allow the OJ Simpson matter to make this case into a circus

[00:58:43.720 --> 00:58:45.860]
judge Lee Ray Sodom and told Glider on Tuesday

[00:58:45.860 --> 00:58:50.160]
according to a transcript but the judge agreed to push back the case after

[00:58:50.160 --> 00:58:53.760]
Glider offered to pay for airfare and lodging for the accuser who was 15.

[00:58:55.020 --> 00:58:57.940]
Glider tried yesterday to downplay the hype surrounding Simpson's later

[00:58:57.940 --> 00:59:01.680]
or latest arrest on kidnapping and burglary charges other than being Mr. Simpson

[00:59:01.680 --> 00:59:04.760]
there's nothing unusual about this case glider said my office handles

[00:59:04.760 --> 00:59:10.000]
tons of these cases every month tons of these cases where people go in

[00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:14.820]
with with the weapon with a bunch of thugs and steal a bunch of crap that they

[00:59:14.820 --> 00:59:19.420]
claim belongs to them wow whether that's true with certain gliders

[00:59:19.420 --> 00:59:22.580]
representation of Simpson has brought a more publicity than any client of his

[00:59:22.580 --> 00:59:26.440]
says this from the hero but by the way we we've got to do something about that

[00:59:27.100 --> 00:59:30.160]
Michael Mayo story because the Sun Sentinel website has screwed up

[00:59:31.400 --> 00:59:35.880]
so if there's anybody out there who can actually get the story to show up

[00:59:35.880 --> 00:59:40.060]
and full online we appreciate if you'd fax it to us right so then the

[00:59:40.060 --> 00:59:43.860]
judge can fax it to me because it's about you know it's about oh

[00:59:43.860 --> 00:59:49.400]
how about that kid from a few that got you yeah

[00:59:49.400 --> 00:59:53.180]
don't tease me bro it's about him well I guess they they were just

[00:59:53.180 --> 00:59:56.440]
teasing us they're on the Sun Sentinel website the headline is there and then

[00:59:56.440 --> 00:59:59.140]
you do everything under the Sun to try to get the story to come up and it won't

[00:59:59.140 --> 01:00:02.940]
show you the story Mike Mayo what a crappy website the Sun Sentinel's got

[01:00:02.940 --> 01:00:08.080]
almost as bad as the hero did blows a former date stated turn these off as

[01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:11.080]
prosecutor glider was mentioned in news articles occasionally the 80s and

[01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:14.300]
early 90s actually began private practice as a criminal defense lawyer

[01:00:14.300 --> 01:00:17.920]
glider attended the University of Miami and received his law degree from

[01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:21.240]
Nova southeastern he defended headline grabbing clients like accused

[01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:24.140]
cop killers and drugs muggers among others but there was little mention of

[01:00:24.140 --> 01:00:26.840]
glider in the press till December of 2000 when he landed new client

[01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:27.820]
oh Jay

[01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:33.440]
glider first represented Simpson in the 2000 are you trying to Sun Sentinel

[01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:37.080]
thing again or is it not going to just print out I mean I'm still on it I mean

[01:00:37.080 --> 01:00:40.400]
I'm refreshing it you know it's very refreshing but I'm not the

[01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:43.040]
suspect showing you the headline and Mike Mayo has got this article about

[01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:46.220]
which he knew the kid and the kid wrote some crap for the Sun Sentinel and

[01:00:46.220 --> 01:00:50.000]
yada yada yada and he was bright and he was this and but he because from his

[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:53.800]
blog yesterday I wrote that he was going to be writing about it today so I

[01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:56.280]
went right to it and I thought yeah I wonder what might Mayo wrote about it

[01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:58.840]
and there's the headline but it's just a big tape a tease

[01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:04.460]
gliders for our first representative Simpson in the 2001 road raid incident and

[01:01:04.460 --> 01:01:07.460]
the live lawsuit against tabloid that report has kind of been in a pornographic

[01:01:07.460 --> 01:01:10.880]
movie Simpson civil defense team referred him to glider after Simpson moved

[01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:14.520]
from LA to Kindle I'm humbled that OJ put his trust in me

[01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:18.500]
glider said in a 2001 New Yorker profile of Simpson my parents are walking

[01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:23.700]
on a cloud nine because OJ picked me to be a spokesman oh my god wow

[01:01:23.700 --> 01:01:26.600]
since then gliders name and quotes have been printed across the country

[01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:31.020]
every time Simpson said a one in with a law there was the 2001 federal

[01:01:31.020 --> 01:01:34.300]
raid of Simpson's Kindle home and agents confiscated drugs and an awful

[01:01:34.300 --> 01:01:39.020]
satellite TV equipment you hear that the the sirens out there can you hear us yes

[01:01:39.020 --> 01:01:42.580]
they're coming for wow when you live in a big city man there's always sirens all

[01:01:42.580 --> 01:01:49.440]
the time just nonstop police and fire and paramedics and in 2002 Simpson was

[01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:53.400]
taken for speeding his power both through a manatee zone he paid $130 fine I

[01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:58.400]
forgot about that one in 2003 a domestic violence call it Simpson's

[01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:01.580]
home turned out to be false but collended a damaged control actor Simpson

[01:02:01.580 --> 01:02:06.060]
using colorful language vented to reporters he vented after a Kentucky

[01:02:06.060 --> 01:02:09.200]
restaurant tour kicked Simpson out of the steakhouse in May glider against

[01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:12.700]
him after his client he screwed with the wrong guy he really did glider said

[01:02:12.700 --> 01:02:17.560]
just like the run in the cold they screwed with the wrong guy too I guess the

[01:02:17.560 --> 01:02:20.920]
cold screwed the wrong guy glider is probably the attention he's gotten from

[01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:24.380]
handling Simpson's legal affairs in a way steady gig of TV commentary he's

[01:02:24.380 --> 01:02:26.720]
appeared as a legal analyst and doesn't the cable news shows and

[01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:31.720]
discussing cases of Kobe Bryant Scott Peterson Robert Blake and others with

[01:02:31.720 --> 01:02:35.400]
his made for TV draw line an easy smile glider said he's happiest in public

[01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:39.060]
arena is on TV and in the courtroom glider told reporters yesterday not to call

[01:02:39.060 --> 01:02:43.800]
Simpson for comment all interviews will go through me he said just like a

[01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:45.900]
taser gone all the interviews will go through

[01:02:45.900 --> 01:02:53.040]
he'll go and just something I don't know but then again that's lawyers for you

[01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:56.760]
know they were maybe that's what those maybe that's what the sirens ambulance

[01:02:56.760 --> 01:02:59.880]
faces maybe that's what that signify maybe it was an act of God

[01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:03.260]
God that is I was reading that story that thing was a blown off

[01:03:03.900 --> 01:03:07.000]
1137 votes on the pool photographs 242

floodruckers and poor people in plantation they were deprived of their

[01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:35.560]
floodruckers when they shut that one down on the university and um

derogatory about Arby's we got like all people but and the people that work

[01:03:49.380 --> 01:03:51.120]
though I guess got all the men out of shape remember that

[01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:55.920]
I like that I like Arby's now what's that uh serial

[01:03:56.440 --> 01:03:59.880]

[01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:38.980]

I'll tell you a lot of people only thought she had a substance abuse problem

[01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:35.060]

[01:05:56.760 --> 01:05:58.900]
and I say we're blocking

[01:06:00.140 --> 01:06:04.740]
love and top fashion were a very dance and bad luck

[01:06:04.740 --> 01:06:09.400]

[01:06:31.240 --> 01:06:34.180]
Thanks to Sean the Felix the cat guy on the am I space for

[01:06:35.120 --> 01:06:39.180]
Emailing me a Michael Mayo's calm and I'm sure they're pouring in across the fast machine not

[01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:42.100]
Did you get any? No?

[01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:44.420]
Got a lot of food over here. That's wings

[01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:50.160]
One guy needs to put no need to sandwich because I already got to strangle me to steer while you eat you got one sandwich sashimi

[01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:53.940]
It's a Mona Lisa. It's like a fried chicken with mozzarella with like a red pepper and

[01:06:54.840 --> 01:06:56.640]
What else is on there? Oh, but to things

[01:06:57.360 --> 01:06:57.720]
Ruggola

[01:06:58.520 --> 01:06:59.720]
Wow, all-somic. What?

[01:07:00.420 --> 01:07:02.020]
Bit of grat it's good stuff

[01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:08.880]
I'm sitting here with maybe I have to make some more bacon and make noise and make a lot of noise on here while you're eating by the way

[01:07:09.560 --> 01:07:10.220]
Like that

[01:07:10.220 --> 01:07:11.160]
Mmm-hmm

[01:07:11.740 --> 01:07:15.640]
Whatever the guy yesterday whatever his name was willard. Yeah will of the rat

[01:07:17.100 --> 01:07:21.580]
Anyway, Michael Mayo says I have to admit I admire this spark and Myers writing in 2004

[01:07:21.580 --> 01:07:24.360]
But if stick it to the John Kerry talk in Gainesville on Monday

[01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:29.060]
Which is vaulted into instance celebrity status seem more shock-jock than HL-Manken and

[01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:36.200]
Arambley and sometimes crude discourse. He has to ascended or carry why he didn't contest the 2004 election results more strongly

[01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:41.360]
Why he isn't pushing for the impeachment of President Bush and whether he belonged to the secretive Skolenbones Club at Yale

[01:07:42.820 --> 01:07:46.640]
Still the shock top of shock top response to Mars confrontation obnoxious

[01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:51.460]
What word did you say and perhaps contrabed random of a student activism was a hundred times more offensive?

[01:07:52.040 --> 01:07:54.780]
I mean really tasering a student after he hogged a microphone

[01:07:54.780 --> 01:08:01.160]
Shocking guy in a submission when he wielded only a grateful last book my god the man already endured two hours of John Kerry

[01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:06.040]
Wasn't that punishment enough? Oh my god still by all means Mike Mayo says the campus

[01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:10.040]
Police should have given Meyer the bum is Russian perhaps even arrested him for not complying with the orders

[01:08:10.040 --> 01:08:15.520]
But all they did with their still a stunning public spectacle was give Meyer 21 the attention he seemed to be craving

[01:08:16.480 --> 01:08:22.740]
The 12-page police report detaining Myers arrested charges resisting officers with a violence with violence of felony and

[01:08:22.740 --> 01:08:23.960]
Disturbing the piece of misdemeanor

[01:08:23.960 --> 01:08:29.700]
Notice that he handled a cancourt handed a cancourt to woman before it approached the microphone allegedly saying are you taping this?

[01:08:29.780 --> 01:08:30.680]
Do you have this you ready?

[01:08:31.980 --> 01:08:32.460]
I

[01:08:32.460 --> 01:08:39.000]
Reducing officer Nicole Mallow who tasered Meyer also wrote that on the trip to jail Meyer was laughing and being light-hearted in the car

[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.460]
His demeanor completely changed once the cameras were not inside

[01:08:42.020 --> 01:08:46.780]
But I don't know how much I could trust Malo considering she wrote that Meyer was inciting a riot police

[01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:53.220]
I don't know Myers motivation his website the Andrew Meyer calm makes me wonder the Andrew Meyer calm

[01:08:53.220 --> 01:08:58.720]
This is a guy who be cyberfriend himself as the Andrew Meyer also has an email address of famous writer man

[01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:03.940]
In a 2005 column for the independent Florida alligator he wrote about his

[01:09:03.940 --> 01:09:10.280]
Proprocivity for provocation. I absolutely love the thought that some nonsense I wrote irritated people enough for them to let everyone know

[01:09:10.280 --> 01:09:12.540]
How much they dislike what I wrote he said

[01:09:13.460 --> 01:09:17.360]
His high school journalism advisor described him as passionate and eloquent

[01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:22.300]
O-line Cognitive is not for the Sun Central features editor who supervised him when he contributed the newspaper from

[01:09:22.300 --> 01:09:27.800]
2002 to 2006 said he was one of the finest students I've ever worked with it was always polite and reliable

[01:09:27.800 --> 01:09:29.600]
It was always passionate about politics

[01:09:30.220 --> 01:09:36.520]
Maybe he's an impassioned political idealist a self-promoting narcissist or a little of both with a war rampaging in young Americans dying

[01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:38.900]
It's just nice to see that someone on campus has a pulse

[01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:44.660]
The police is over the top response can only be seen as a message to those who did a question authority

[01:09:44.660 --> 01:09:50.980]
University of Florida president Bernard Macon told reporters on Tuesday he regretted the incident and was embarrassed by it

[01:09:50.980 --> 01:09:56.300]
Two campus offices have been suspended pending investigation the Taser use don't tease me bro

[01:09:58.720 --> 01:10:01.580]
Still this should be a lesson to Meyer if he's gonna be a provocateur

[01:10:01.580 --> 01:10:06.180]
He needs to learn the basics of civil disobedience like how to get arrested without resisting. Oh

[01:10:06.680 --> 01:10:08.060]
Where do you read about that?

[01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:10.040]
Is it like a manual for that?

[01:10:10.860 --> 01:10:12.440]
It's an automatic for that. No

[01:10:12.980 --> 01:10:16.020]
I can't find it. He's an Ozone provocateur. There it is

[01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:21.120]
Like how to get arrested without resisting otherwise, bro. Sometimes you get burned or shocked bro

[01:10:21.580 --> 01:10:24.700]
That's what Michael Mayo says. Bro. Don't tease me bro

[01:10:27.800 --> 01:10:31.740]
Like you got a hand into it. She did a magnificent job of a provoking and being a provocateur

[01:10:31.740 --> 01:10:36.720]
And they reacted like a bunch of idiots and they know everybody feels for him even though he may have been a jackass

[01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:39.100]
You know in a goofball. I find the whole thing funny

[01:10:40.180 --> 01:10:41.720]
Yeah, most of music that's right

[01:10:42.740 --> 01:10:50.340]
Because he was making a mockery of something. I'm glad he did it. I'm glad they taste them. I still don't know. I'm glad for all of it. Right

[01:10:51.660 --> 01:10:56.200]
I'm glad for a hall of aah. It was good fun. That's right. Troph on hall of aah is really good

[01:10:56.200 --> 01:11:01.000]
Not that diet hall of aah. Oh boy. You talk about making a wild run to the magic room

[01:11:01.540 --> 01:11:06.420]
And you know who that was that was your accountant your your from orthodox duo accountant that gave me that

[01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:11.960]
Sugar free a diet hall of aah to panther game that tour. Oh

[01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:12.680]
brother

[01:11:13.620 --> 01:11:17.620]
You talk about a gigantic explosion. Wow. I'm sorry Joyce

[01:11:18.580 --> 01:11:20.820]
Like I said, you talk about a gigantic Joyce

[01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:25.900]
1156 as in Q56 that's how many vote we got on our pool

[01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:32.060]
We're we're thinking like a big number today like what about 45 million votes. Yes, I'm like that

[01:11:32.060 --> 01:11:34.140]
Everybody in America is going to vote on this pool

[01:11:35.580 --> 01:11:40.060]
The best burgers come from or came from if it's a place that's no longer with us

[01:11:40.660 --> 01:11:41.720]
A place that's deceased

[01:11:42.900 --> 01:11:45.200]
Fudruckers 246 Charhot 179

[01:11:45.980 --> 01:11:47.520]
Fudruckers seems to have pretty safe lead

[01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:51.560]
Now there are a lot of Fudruckers in town or my dream. I only knew it before

[01:11:53.900 --> 01:11:55.140]
That's the only one I ever seen

[01:11:58.600 --> 01:12:02.480]
You don't know any other ones. Well, why did you google it? Fudruckers, Florida

[01:12:03.860 --> 01:12:07.560]
Can you handle it? Hey, well, I'm gonna put a lot of pressure on you. You know the food is there

[01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:12.120]
Oh, we're building the party is a tend to drift in that direction. We're dealing with important things right now

[01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:14.660]
Don't be eating with your mouthful. How old?

[01:12:15.780 --> 01:12:21.200]
Charhot 179 they're like 21 67 votes behind when these is in there like I said with triple digits 102

[01:12:21.880 --> 01:12:27.140]
And stake in check 94 in and out 84 white castle 83 and win on 81 after that

[01:12:27.140 --> 01:12:31.460]
It's all the rooties is making a nice move to come from zero to 43 is

[01:12:32.020 --> 01:12:33.480]
staggering shocking

[01:12:34.380 --> 01:12:39.900]
Burger queen the nevanie that's because nobody remembers burger queen only this old queen remembers burger queen

[01:12:42.060 --> 01:12:46.380]
Maybe I made it up. Maybe it was really burger chef the more I think about it burger chef was good

[01:12:47.660 --> 01:12:53.380]
You remember burger chef? Yeah, that was the one the the the one that immediately comes to mind

[01:12:53.380 --> 01:12:56.100]
Way before Fudruckers with a fixins bar. That's what they call it

[01:12:56.100 --> 01:13:00.740]
We got a fixins bar come in you order your burger whatever you like a single double a cheeseburger

[01:13:00.740 --> 01:13:05.260]
What yeah, and then just plain is all they give it to you hold on let us hold the pickles special orders

[01:13:05.260 --> 01:13:08.480]
Don't upset as however that goes but it didn't taste like this Mona Lisa sandwich

[01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:10.960]
I'm sure it didn't

[01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:13.360]
But then again they didn't have Mona Lisa was on the wall

[01:13:14.620 --> 01:13:19.680]
11.58 on the survey boy if we can get up to 1200 by noon. I'm gonna I'm taking the rest of day off

[01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:26.020]
Hahaha, oh. I'm gonna go soak my head in Val voltina

[01:13:27.140 --> 01:13:31.000]
We got that hurricane game today boy. How come you're not talking about the hurry themes

[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:32.860]
That's what we ought to be talking about is football

[01:13:32.860 --> 01:13:34.360]
Arachite, ink bow!

[01:13:34.700 --> 01:13:37.660]
I mean that's why we're now talking about it. Maybe they're gonna get bombed again like they did by

[01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:45.660]
Oklahoma. So there's only three floodrackers in Florida. Yeah. Miami on 10680

[01:13:46.700 --> 01:13:50.400]
Northwest 19th Street. Wow! One in Wellington,

[01:13:52.960 --> 01:13:58.180]
10880 Forest Hill Boulevard and one in Orlando. Forest Hill Boulevard. I used to live on

[01:13:58.180 --> 01:14:01.320]
Forest Hill Boulevard. 100 years people. And what was the other one in Orlando?

[01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:05.580]
Orlando. It's all about them. They're all a bunch of going anywhere up there. Yeah, they've

[01:14:05.580 --> 01:14:09.780]
used to be, I want to say another three that I knew about that have all been out of business

[01:14:09.780 --> 01:14:13.960]
the last two or three years. Now why do you think that is? They went out of business because

[01:14:13.960 --> 01:14:20.940]
they were shut down like the one in plantation area because don't know. Probably because of you.

[01:14:21.700 --> 01:14:27.420]
Yes, probably my fault. I wasn't bothered to find him enough for not promoting them enough.

[01:14:28.460 --> 01:14:32.060]
floodrackers. I have no problem with them. Just don't butt at a bum when you go there. Just say,

[01:14:32.220 --> 01:14:35.760]
hey don't put it unless you want them to butt at a bum. It's like when you go to Ruth Chris.

[01:14:36.500 --> 01:14:41.560]
You know, they they they broil the stakes in butter. Don't butt at the butt, bro. They'll butt at

[01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:45.480]
high temperatures. So tell them hold the butter when you order the stake of Ruth Chris. If you have

[01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:49.160]
a sensitive stomach and you don't want to be making an immediate run to that room, you know what I mean?

[01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:57.020]
Just tell you. What a pole just came back up very strange on there. 1164 like there was a chunk

[01:14:57.020 --> 01:15:02.440]
of votes that just came in. And of course some of these places wouldn't surprise me. I think

[01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:06.560]
Trump's is the appropriate term for it. That's okay. Our crowd likes food, man. We like to mind

[01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:11.040]
your mind especially. Eating while you're on the air talking with your mom. What is that? My favorite

[01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:15.220]
answer. I'll do it again. Get that world and all bent out of shape. Sorry, let me take a breath.

[01:15:18.920 --> 01:15:23.120]
And fantastic. Ali Joe Bells got the nerve to like send us that email like send it along.

[01:15:23.120 --> 01:15:28.420]
I'm sure he thought it was funny. He thought it was funny. Yeah, he thought it was funny, huh?

[01:15:28.760 --> 01:15:33.560]
Well, he doesn't know what funny is, you know. Oh, yeah, he even knows from funny. He's funny.

[01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:40.880]
Just where do they find him? Where do they dig his fat ass up? I don't know. There were kids.

[01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:45.240]
Carolina. He's under the side of the building. It's oh come on. Greg Reed got

[01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:48.360]
a can't have out of we bring you over here Joe. We'll bring you Joe Bell over to

[01:15:48.900 --> 01:15:53.200]
the place. I did a magazine. John. I don't think anybody does it better.

[01:15:53.700 --> 01:15:58.640]
Nobody does it better than Johnny Joe. He could take a wet dream and turn it into a nightmare.

[01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:06.820]
Be sure to turn this place into the I've earned that in very little time. Over we got Joe Rose

[01:16:06.820 --> 01:16:10.220]
back. Yeah, that how's that working on anybody out there? How many people know about that?

[01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:14.100]
About the third man. How many people know that Joe is back on our station? Morning 7 to 10 a.m.

[01:16:14.100 --> 01:16:17.480]
By the way, nobody does it better. Carly Simon. Right. You're going to talk it up or what?

[01:16:17.740 --> 01:16:24.480]
I don't think so. Too tough and ass-time.

[01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.580]
What word do you say? Joe is in the last.

[01:16:28.580 --> 01:16:30.320]
Joe is 456.

[01:16:30.620 --> 01:16:31.280]
2 a.m.

[01:16:31.440 --> 01:16:32.340]
Nick. Fourth.

[01:16:32.720 --> 01:16:33.000]
Later.

[01:16:37.700 --> 01:16:44.520]
This is the CBS evening news with Dan Ruther reporting from CBS News headquarters in New York.

[01:16:44.920 --> 01:16:50.200]
Greening this is Dan Ruther reporting. In shocking news today, this reporter has just

[01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:56.200]
confirmed that President George W. Bush is a raging potter. A gorgeous smoking

[01:16:56.200 --> 01:17:01.880]
re-promade stormer. No, we didn't make it this time. According to recent me or

[01:17:01.880 --> 01:17:06.220]
released hate recordings, made several years ago, President Bush is clearly indicating

[01:17:06.220 --> 01:17:12.400]
that he may have tried marijuana at some time in the past. This startling revolution may explain

[01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:19.060]
his word speech, crystal intelligence, and disappearance from National Guard duty during the Vietnam

[01:17:19.060 --> 01:17:24.780]
era. No, I just can't let that one go, sorry. Not wanting to say I told his own,

[01:17:24.780 --> 01:17:27.420]
this reporter will take the high road and say only.

[01:17:29.840 --> 01:17:35.000]
And that's part of our world. The satisfying, big dude, I hope you're happy now, you stupid

[01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:40.380]
red-state bastards. I'm a man rather reporting for CBS News. I don't want to tell you

[01:17:40.380 --> 01:17:44.320]
to go get a, I get my half of that seven million by the way. I don't want to go. I'm 45 at

[01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:49.040]
QIM and there was more of that article. I'm, you know, Felix the cat there, uh,

[01:17:49.100 --> 01:17:53.320]
saw whatever his name is. He did a fine job in sending him most of the article, but he left off

[01:17:53.320 --> 01:18:00.120]
the first paragraph and then in his email. Because now they fixed it on the Sunsetta website.

[01:18:00.360 --> 01:18:03.440]
I knew, oh man, after I talked about it on there, they fixed it. I think it must be just a

[01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:08.380]
call. They heard it. They heard it. My thing. No. Michael Mayors-Calm, I'll just read the part

[01:18:08.380 --> 01:18:11.660]
that I didn't read before. He said, I tried calling Andrew Meyer a few times on Wednesday.

[01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:15.300]
At first, the voice mail box on his cell phone was full. Later, when I was able to leave a

[01:18:15.300 --> 01:18:19.220]
message, I reminded him that I once awarded him first place in high school journalism contest

[01:18:19.220 --> 01:18:23.020]
for his columns at Sacriss Bay High in Western and hope that given a sudden drill to fame,

[01:18:23.020 --> 01:18:27.420]
he still had time to talk to a little person like me. Finally, with a deadline closing and I

[01:18:27.420 --> 01:18:32.880]
like to disparage plea, don't dis me, bro. But the University of Florida senior is made, don't

[01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:38.500]
tase me, bro, one of the latest instant catchphrase. Didn't call back. And then there's the article that I

[01:18:38.500 --> 01:18:44.240]
read. How do you like that? So thanks to you, Goop balls at the Sunsetta website were finally fixing

[01:18:44.240 --> 01:18:48.540]
that so the world can read what they, and I read it and you know something I got to read it,

[01:18:48.580 --> 01:18:51.820]
and I don't know what the least said. But a beep, but a boop, but about all over the place. When

[01:18:51.820 --> 01:18:56.520]
you say it was like all over the road, okay? Kind of like our format here on QA and not MOR,

[01:18:56.520 --> 01:19:02.060]
middle of the road, not to have an EOR into the road. You know what he said? What? Don't tase me, bro.

[01:19:04.860 --> 01:19:09.740]
Don't talk with your mouthful now. We got 14 minutes until we do the thing here.

[01:19:11.580 --> 01:19:17.900]
So we do the Thursday thing. Traffic jam, the two lane road leading into the tiny town of

[01:19:17.960 --> 01:19:22.460]
Gina early Thursday, as thousands of demonstrators gathered in support of six black teens initially

[01:19:22.460 --> 01:19:27.080]
charged with attempted murder in the beating of a white classmate. The Reverend Al Sharpton,

[01:19:27.080 --> 01:19:31.960]
one of the worst opportunists in the history of the human race, said it could be the beginning

[01:19:31.960 --> 01:19:36.480]
of the 21st century civil rights movement, one that would challenge disparities in the justice system.

[01:19:37.280 --> 01:19:41.460]
You can't have justice needed out based on who you are rather than what you did, Sharpton told

[01:19:41.460 --> 01:19:46.560]
CBS is the early show today, which nobody watches. The six were charged a few months after the

[01:19:46.560 --> 01:19:50.740]
local prosecutor defined the charge three white high school students who hung nooses in a tree

[01:19:50.740 --> 01:19:55.140]
on their high school grounds. Five of the black teens were initially charged with attempted murder,

[01:19:55.360 --> 01:20:00.200]
but that charge was reduced to battery for all but one, whereas yet to be arraigned, the 16 was

[01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:05.840]
charged as a juvenile. This is the most blatant example of disparity in the justice system we see

[01:20:05.840 --> 01:20:09.900]
in Sharpton said you can't have two standards of justice. We didn't bring race in it, those

[01:20:09.900 --> 01:20:15.840]
who hung the nooses brought the race into it. District Attorney Reid Walters breaking the long

[01:20:15.840 --> 01:20:19.540]
public sounds tonight yesterday that racism was involved. He said he didn't prosecute the

[01:20:19.540 --> 01:20:23.320]
students because of hanging the nooses because he could find no Louisiana law under which they could

[01:20:23.320 --> 01:20:28.120]
be charged. I can't overemphasize what a villainous act that was, the people that it should be ashamed

[01:20:28.120 --> 01:20:32.660]
of what they unleashed on this time, Walters said. In the beating case, he said four of the defendants

[01:20:32.660 --> 01:20:37.060]
were of adult age under Louisiana law and the only juvenile charges in adult Michael Bell had a

[01:20:37.060 --> 01:20:42.640]
prior criminal record that's Michael M.Y. CHAL. The case has been portrayed by the news media

[01:20:42.640 --> 01:20:47.540]
as being about race. He said in the fact that it takes place in a small town, a small southern

[01:20:47.540 --> 01:20:52.140]
town lends itself to that portrayal. But it is not never has been about racists about finding

[01:20:52.140 --> 01:20:57.400]
justice for an innocent victim and holding people accountable for their actions. Are we supposed

[01:20:57.400 --> 01:21:01.620]
to do that? Hold black people accountable for their actions too when did that start? I thought

[01:21:01.620 --> 01:21:05.520]
when we had the first O.J. trial, I thought that was like we said, we don't want to do that no more.

[01:21:06.940 --> 01:21:11.040]
The white teen who was beaten just in barker was not unconscious. His face badly swollen and

[01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:16.000]
bloody though he was able to attend a school function later that night. Bell, 16th of the time,

[01:21:16.100 --> 01:21:20.020]
the attack is the only one of the genus, six to be tried so far. He was convicted on an

[01:21:20.020 --> 01:21:23.700]
aggravated secondary battery count that could have sent him to prison for 15 years. But the

[01:21:23.700 --> 01:21:26.760]
conviction was over turn last week when the state appeals court said he should not have been

[01:21:26.760 --> 01:21:31.200]
tried as an adult. Today's protests had been planned to coincide with Bell sentencing,

[01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:36.220]
but organizers decided to press ahead even after the conviction was thrown out. Bell remains in jail

[01:21:36.220 --> 01:21:40.720]
while prosecute is preparing to appeal his money, unable to meet the $90,000 bond. But I'm sure

[01:21:40.720 --> 01:21:46.400]
that we can handle it. Durg and Chris will get it together. We have all family members about the

[01:21:46.400 --> 01:21:49.280]
age of these guys. We said it could have been one of them. We wanted to try to do something

[01:21:49.280 --> 01:21:53.040]
said, Angela Merrick 36 of Atlanta, who drove with three friends from Atlanta to protest the

[01:21:53.040 --> 01:21:57.000]
treatment of the genus six. The rally was heavily promoted on black websites, blogs, radio

[01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:02.080]
publications, but you do understand it was an erasial thing. Students came from schools across the

[01:22:02.080 --> 01:22:06.480]
region including historically black colleges like Morehouse College, Spellman College, Clark Atlanta

[01:22:06.480 --> 01:22:12.300]
University Howard University, Hampton University, and Southern University. Tina Cheed and missed

[01:22:12.300 --> 01:22:15.940]
the civil rights marches at Selma Montgomery Little Rock, but she had no intention of missing

[01:22:15.940 --> 01:22:20.560]
another brush with history. The 24-year-old Georgia Southern University graduate drove all

[01:22:20.560 --> 01:22:24.560]
lights to reach tiny Gina in central Louisiana. It was a good chance to be part of something

[01:22:24.560 --> 01:22:28.320]
historic since I wasn't around for the civil rights movement. She said this is kind of the 21st

[01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:32.020]
century version of it. Others supported the effort but were that it could have ruled race

[01:22:32.020 --> 01:22:36.960]
relations in Gina even further. I don't think it will cause any major confrontation said Odec

[01:22:36.960 --> 01:22:42.400]
to Hickman 72, but there probably going to be some friendships lost. 3500 residents and in

[01:22:42.400 --> 01:22:46.960]
Gina some residents now worry about safety. Who tells her book this far away is Naches Mississippi

[01:22:46.960 --> 01:22:53.480]
to a Alexandra Luziana. Naches Mississippi. Wow, Everbeen Air.

[01:22:56.900 --> 01:23:02.300]
What? Red Cross Officials, man, First Aid, Station Data Local Court House had water

[01:23:02.300 --> 01:23:06.580]
and snacks on hand, portable toilets and flashing street signs to aid in traffic congestion

[01:23:06.580 --> 01:23:11.640]
were in place. Wow, I have a whole big stimulus, a big to do. Oh, there's that kid again

[01:23:11.640 --> 01:23:15.560]
on CNN that he put that on the right and middle of your lunch. Oh, I was about to change it back

[01:23:15.560 --> 01:23:20.200]
when you said that. I'm glad you said which kid it was. Kirk says check a website called tshirthell.com.

[01:23:20.200 --> 01:23:25.220]
That's a good place. They have shirts like don't taste me bro. Barry Bond takes it in the

[01:23:25.220 --> 01:23:31.920]
racked home steroids and in the coal shirts, Obama shirts and it says sorry some of my

[01:23:31.920 --> 01:23:37.040]
sproving is wrong. No problem Kirk. Thanks for the memories. Oh brother look at that. Andy

[01:23:37.040 --> 01:23:44.040]
and Howard. Oh, just died. He and also his boyfriend. That's right. He's sitting there

[01:23:44.040 --> 01:23:49.080]
hand in hand. What a boring show. Yeah, because we don't have Andy on the phone and his

[01:23:49.080 --> 01:23:57.060]
buddy his boyfriend Greg from Port St. Lucy. Oh, how can I continue? How very, very sad.

[01:23:57.200 --> 01:24:02.000]
And they're saying, he's talking about us again. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, and I'm sure that busy

[01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:06.280]
tickling each other's fans in other lives complete. That's correct. They're fancy what?

[01:24:08.180 --> 01:24:15.780]
Goods. So, what an 84 we got. 1184. We're only 16 away from 1200. But boy, what a boring show.

[01:24:15.780 --> 01:24:19.720]
And that's because I'm mailing it in. If we just had those real nifty calls, we could open up that

[01:24:19.720 --> 01:24:27.940]
phone. Yeah. To Andy and Greg and Greg and Andy and Shamba knows that crowd of misfits.

[01:24:29.040 --> 01:24:34.600]
Why not just get a big, a nice big extra large t-shirt and drape it over your body and your ass that

[01:24:34.600 --> 01:24:39.360]
says, I'm a misfit. In other words, I have no life. That's what they ought to be doing. Have

[01:24:39.360 --> 01:24:44.560]
like a big billboard with an arrow pointing to them. We have no life and the neos are life. Even

[01:24:44.560 --> 01:24:48.920]
the way he hates us like poison, which is we would croak. Every once in a while, Greg tries to

[01:24:48.920 --> 01:24:53.100]
get back into my space thing. He tries to get on there and it's not going to happen. Ain't

[01:24:53.100 --> 01:24:57.280]
going to work. And just guess who else tried to get on there again disguised as somebody the other

[01:24:57.280 --> 01:25:05.140]
day? Al Rogers again. Oh boy. Yeah, you draw them in, don't you? Oh, yeah, you pull them. I

[01:25:05.140 --> 01:25:12.240]
am a maggot magnet, both on the air and off the air. I am a maggot magnet. Make no mistake about it.

[01:25:12.920 --> 01:25:17.920]
I make sure I got a lot of maggots in Mexico, wouldn't you think? I imagine. Of all varieties.

[01:25:19.360 --> 01:25:22.780]
11, let's see. Are we going to make 1200 by the top of the air? That'd be really something.

[01:25:22.920 --> 01:25:26.080]
Then plus we got the restaurant deal with lefties coming to the top of the air and you guys are

[01:25:26.080 --> 01:25:30.600]
eating all that great food. What was that sandwich you said again? It was a Mona Lisa, which was

[01:25:30.600 --> 01:25:40.040]
like a fried chicken, filet, breast, breaded with arugula and mozzarella, roasted bread peppers.

[01:25:41.380 --> 01:25:45.340]
Red what kind of peppers? Shabbat of red. I don't know what we can say that on the air.

[01:25:47.120 --> 01:25:51.140]
Not again. I'm sure in Georgia, I'm going to grab a sandwich and they've went like hot,

[01:25:51.220 --> 01:25:56.300]
they brought like a giant tray of them and they last in like 30 seconds. Excellent. They're still there.

[01:25:56.920 --> 01:26:00.280]
Yeah, yeah. Well, thanks a lot guys. They're legal. I can't enjoy any of it, but then again,

[01:26:00.280 --> 01:26:04.420]
I don't need it, you know. We're going to go in China, Duff Dose, Xavier, Locke and Co. I just don't

[01:26:04.420 --> 01:26:08.200]
need them. We're going to go smokeable to revise break. Are you really? Well, I'm going to start

[01:26:08.200 --> 01:26:11.580]
doing drugs. Heavy. In fact, I think I'll take tomorrow off. Oh, I can't do it. You know,

[01:26:11.680 --> 01:26:17.180]
actually, I would do that. No. No, what? You're not allowed to. Well, you have ratings coming

[01:26:17.180 --> 01:26:21.840]
tomorrow morning at 10. Maybe I'll leave at 10.30. No. In fact, if they're, but I think they're going to

[01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:28.480]
be, maybe we'll all be leaving about 10.15. Not Chris though. Hey, you're in. I'm sure they like

[01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:33.420]
you a lot. That's why you're working 20 hours today. 11.91 on our burger survey. Boy,

[01:26:33.600 --> 01:26:37.740]
I guarantee you Brandon is he's rubbing his highlights together right now. He's so excited about

[01:26:37.740 --> 01:26:42.360]
his burger. Although it's not going over as big. What was the one we had for it? Oh, that was the

[01:26:42.360 --> 01:26:46.760]
OJ one. Remember, we had 14. I'm hearing the show. We're not going to do that today. I don't think.

[01:26:47.940 --> 01:26:55.580]
Are we? Be positive. Like I said, 13 would be a nice number. The best burgers come from

[01:26:55.580 --> 01:27:01.380]
Fod Rockers 250. Char Hot 185. Well, it's pretty much about the way it has been all the way along.

[01:27:01.660 --> 01:27:07.040]
Wendy's 103. But I got no complaint with Wendy's other than it's the drive-through of some of

[01:27:07.040 --> 01:27:12.580]
their employees tend to be a little on the side. You know what I mean by that? In fact, I'm

[01:27:12.580 --> 01:27:16.980]
discovering that just about anywhere you go, including here that like when you go into retail

[01:27:16.980 --> 01:27:21.020]
stores and like in the malls and stuff like that, they have a bunch of dumb kids who have no idea

[01:27:21.020 --> 01:27:24.900]
what it is that they're doing and who don't really care or getting paid minimum wage, who don't

[01:27:24.900 --> 01:27:29.040]
want to give you any service or it's kind of like you're bothering them and they're whole, they're

[01:27:29.040 --> 01:27:33.920]
whole day consistent. Hey, bro, what time's the lunch break? What time you're going to, who are you going

[01:27:33.920 --> 01:27:38.800]
out with tonight crap like that? And like you're interrupting this. I mean, they're having a good

[01:27:38.800 --> 01:27:44.040]
time and you're like expecting it weighted on. You want service? And like even in some of those

[01:27:44.040 --> 01:27:48.700]
stores I was telling you about those over-priced stores like Abercrombie and Bitch, right? The punks

[01:27:48.700 --> 01:27:53.360]
that work in those places and oh my god, they all the stuff you have to go through every cycle into

[01:27:53.360 --> 01:28:00.360]
the bank, every transactions like a major like a government transaction. That's how my bank is

[01:28:00.360 --> 01:28:04.180]
here. Oh, here's the menu by the way. Here's today's specials from Luck these.

[01:28:05.260 --> 01:28:11.600]
Pasta Fajol. Oh, Pasta Fajolini, excuse me, that's like little tiny of Pasta's. Pasta Fagolini.

[01:28:12.440 --> 01:28:17.100]
Of sausage appetizers, mild Italian sausage, broccoli, a rame and garlic and oil,

[01:28:17.480 --> 01:28:23.660]
a finished and light spicy marinara, crab cakes, beef carpaccio, St. Louis ribs, babyback ribs,

[01:28:23.980 --> 01:28:28.640]
or like Ron Popeel on that spot. Babyback ribs, never see that the informational I'm sure you don't

[01:28:28.640 --> 01:28:33.480]
want to. I want my babyback. Babyback ribs, group of French, sausage onions and peppers pasta.

[01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:37.980]
Oh, that sounds really good. Did they bring that? I want it. Yeah, I can't eat it, but I want it.

[01:28:38.180 --> 01:28:40.780]
It's great. Can I have all this grilled half chicken and pan roasted filet menu on where

[01:28:40.780 --> 01:28:44.600]
yesterday's specials? So we're going to be opening that baby up in about four minutes.

[01:28:45.160 --> 01:28:52.140]
Luck these we got $150 certificates for $25 on wqn.com. I'd get poised to get on there right now.

[01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:55.680]
Wouldn't you be poised? Yeah, I'm poised right now.

[01:28:58.640 --> 01:29:03.580]
I'm a Russian lady and I like scrubbing my smelly gorilla ass with soap made from jewels.

[01:29:04.060 --> 01:29:07.720]
And listening to the new Roque Amunista Hour.

[01:29:08.020 --> 01:29:08.380]
Say, guys!

[01:29:14.240 --> 01:29:15.160]
You're fair.

[01:29:16.300 --> 01:29:19.540]
They do like coffee that's got other guys.

[01:29:20.020 --> 01:29:23.000]
Are usually kindness from what they realize.

[01:29:23.640 --> 01:29:26.920]
They want their dogs in a happily lit light.

[01:29:26.920 --> 01:29:28.800]
It isn't yellow, Jonstra.

[01:29:30.620 --> 01:29:33.820]
What's like it's wonderful to feel their beer.

[01:29:34.360 --> 01:29:37.460]
By talking about sports while drinking a beer.

[01:29:37.800 --> 01:29:40.280]
They desire a course to be a sub.

[01:29:40.500 --> 01:29:43.160]
This is queer horse of yellow, Jonstra.

[01:29:45.200 --> 01:29:46.640]
Yellow, Jonstra.

[01:29:47.200 --> 01:29:48.460]
Yellow, Jonstra.

[01:29:48.740 --> 01:29:50.040]
We're what's new here.

[01:29:50.640 --> 01:29:51.680]
Sports all day.

[01:29:52.460 --> 01:29:53.840]
Yellow, Jonstra.

[01:29:54.360 --> 01:29:55.660]
Yellow, Jonstra.

[01:29:55.660 --> 01:29:59.500]
The baddest thing here is something I have lead in.

[01:29:59.760 --> 01:30:02.920]
Anyone who wants to hear your sports will sink in day.

[01:30:03.100 --> 01:30:04.960]
History, the title of the rule.

[01:30:05.240 --> 01:30:06.440]
School, the Shower's free.

[01:30:06.900 --> 01:30:08.280]
Yellow, Jonstra.

[01:30:09.980 --> 01:30:13.500]
They have also dogs that's what a gay made place.

[01:30:14.020 --> 01:30:17.120]
And somebody's kid with the furry canes.

[01:30:17.160 --> 01:30:19.980]
You talk about it all the time and make you a bagged.

[01:30:20.040 --> 01:30:22.720]
I'm afraid you like yellow, Jonstra.

[01:30:24.620 --> 01:30:27.860]
Shurding and burning out, warning shows.

[01:30:28.200 --> 01:30:30.920]
No interest in learning how radio.

[01:30:31.760 --> 01:30:35.040]
Just the sausage party for a musical host.

[01:30:35.360 --> 01:30:37.160]
Who like yellow, Jonstra.

[01:30:38.960 --> 01:30:40.640]
Yellow, Jonstra.

[01:30:41.180 --> 01:30:42.440]
Yellow, Jonstra.

[01:30:42.760 --> 01:30:46.040]
Sports host is these who all end out.

[01:30:46.620 --> 01:30:47.860]
Yellow, Jonstra.

[01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:49.680]
Yellow, Jonstra.

[01:30:49.980 --> 01:30:51.340]
They're on your mind.

[01:30:51.340 --> 01:30:53.380]
To see in your mouth.

[01:30:53.980 --> 01:30:55.260]
Sports, sports, sports.

[01:30:55.360 --> 01:30:56.620]
Sports, sports, sports.

[01:30:56.860 --> 01:31:02.100]
Sports all day.

[01:31:02.820 --> 01:31:03.860]
Passion cat.

[01:31:04.660 --> 01:31:05.780]
Sports all day.

[01:31:06.580 --> 01:31:07.000]
Mexico.

[01:31:08.240 --> 01:31:09.360]
Sports all day.

[01:31:10.180 --> 01:31:10.980]
Mexico cat.

[01:31:11.280 --> 01:31:13.320]
And don't forget starting at 3.30 this afternoon,

[01:31:13.500 --> 01:31:15.060]
Mara cat, freaking bloke.

[01:31:15.080 --> 01:31:18.640]
It's cane's droppings for hours, and hours, and just forever.

[01:31:19.200 --> 01:31:20.760]
Hey, more than you can handle, yes?

[01:31:21.160 --> 01:31:26.280]
Don't be saying I like that. Oh, we have to check our thing by the way. We're got a 52

[01:31:28.980 --> 01:31:34.100]
I'm WQM dot com. Yes sir. Well, we'd be doing better than that if I would remember to look at it because when I look at it

[01:31:34.100 --> 01:31:35.880]
I give it the evil eye and all of a sudden they just

[01:31:36.360 --> 01:31:39.880]
Topped them up like crazy. That was that what it is. Oh now. What is that beat Dan?

[01:31:40.600 --> 01:31:45.460]
Marino is above my thing. Yeah, I know. Well, who are you Danny boy? What the hell is that?

[01:31:45.740 --> 01:31:49.440]
I think we need to beat up Josh Cortes beat Dan. My ass nice going Cortes

[01:31:49.440 --> 01:31:52.320]
It's the last check you're getting from me. No wonder he's not here today

[01:31:53.600 --> 01:31:55.260]
52 left out about 51

[01:31:56.440 --> 01:32:01.800]
They're not going as fast and I don't understand why cuz you were raving about how great the food to lift these ones. Oh, it's great food

[01:32:02.780 --> 01:32:05.680]
And we're talking about food today about burgers and everybody ought to be there

[01:32:05.680 --> 01:32:09.700]
Aptota be whipped up to a frenzy, but they're not going in the huge chunks like the usual video

[01:32:09.700 --> 01:32:12.900]
I'm refreshing and clicking over and over again. It's still says 51

[01:32:13.540 --> 01:32:14.540]
From any out of 100

[01:32:15.700 --> 01:32:18.000]
Well, it took 18 minutes to sell the last time we had a hundred

[01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:24.220]
Yeah, so we're doing pretty good here. We are yeah, no, we're not

[01:32:25.180 --> 01:32:30.220]
Nothing that's happening on there, baby nothing that's happening. I'm your boyfriend that thing over and over and over again

[01:32:30.220 --> 01:32:33.580]
Clicking it. I'm twisting it. I'm yanking it. I'm

[01:32:33.580 --> 01:32:37.920]
Nothing's happening still says 51. That's not a good sign man. Not a good sign

[01:32:38.540 --> 01:32:43.620]
49 see 49 calm down 49 my ass. Are you a crazy person or what? Yes?

[01:32:44.740 --> 01:32:48.500]
Yeah, you're right 49 still a lot. That's still like almost half our left

[01:32:48.500 --> 01:32:51.200]
They're supposed to go like like that

[01:32:53.600 --> 01:32:57.940]
Bush's cabinet is going off script and interview with the earth times commons David Brooks yesterday

[01:32:57.940 --> 01:33:02.980]
Defense secretary Ron Robert Gates was asked if the Rack war was worth it his

[01:33:02.980 --> 01:33:08.560]
Response if I had known then what I know now would I have done the same? I think the answer is I don't know

[01:33:08.560 --> 01:33:12.700]
Oh, it sounds like a fat as Johnny Joe. I don't know what to say

[01:33:13.620 --> 01:33:18.540]
I don't know what to tell you Neil. I don't want to tell you what you want for me anyway. You want like real radio?

[01:33:20.760 --> 01:33:23.460]
Yeah, this thing is slowed down to a crawl. This is not a good sign

[01:33:24.700 --> 01:33:27.620]
Maybe they're hung up. What do you mean by that?

[01:33:28.180 --> 01:33:34.820]
Or maybe they can't find where to click on there because Danny marino because Josh Portis stuck Danny marino above our thing to click on there

[01:33:34.820 --> 01:33:37.540]
Maybe that's it. You think that's it. It's good excuse

[01:33:38.440 --> 01:33:39.600]
blame Danny boy

[01:33:41.500 --> 01:33:46.040]
It's got those fancy. I mean, how can you not see there? Where's got my every person? It says open now

[01:33:46.040 --> 01:33:48.880]
It's got all those colorful, you know multi colored

[01:33:50.300 --> 01:33:53.260]
Yeah, oh, you know what I'm clicking on it and it's not working again

[01:33:53.260 --> 01:33:55.680]
I went back to that and I'm broken on it. It's not working

[01:33:56.760 --> 01:34:02.000]
So I guess you have to go away over on the right and now it's like real small and that's why they're not doing it because you got to go

[01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:05.800]
Way down on the right there to find the damn thing to get on it

[01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:09.940]
I don't know what you do that it changes because it always comes up in the same place for me

[01:34:12.740 --> 01:34:17.960]
That changes what the placement of it you said like you know, it's not working on it when you click the left hand side

[01:34:18.400 --> 01:34:22.580]
That's correct something you're doing right on the right there used to be a big

[01:34:23.580 --> 01:34:30.340]
Like a bumper sticker thing there with it and now it's like a little teeny tiny. It's way on down about halfway down you got a scroll way down

[01:34:31.780 --> 01:34:36.240]
And there's saw grants for it and then there's some other thing under that and then there's that little thing again

[01:34:36.240 --> 01:34:41.060]
Which it works. I mean you click it right away, but who does gonna find that and now there's 47 correct?

[01:34:41.360 --> 01:34:43.520]
So this one is down intentionally I think by

[01:34:43.520 --> 01:34:47.820]
Pots getting around putting Dan Marina will above me. I tell you one thing. It's a cold day in hell

[01:34:48.600 --> 01:34:54.500]
When Danny boy is gonna be above me in any way in any sense you sure positive or he's too old to you

[01:34:54.500 --> 01:34:58.720]
Now that's right. He was always too old for me and too ugly those lips. Oh my god

[01:34:59.320 --> 01:35:05.060]
Anyway, it says a Brooks column says after the speech I asked Robert Gates about best ways to spread democracy

[01:35:05.060 --> 01:35:11.300]
We have a variety of tools. He said not all of them are hammers Ronald Reagan deployed more of the array than many he said

[01:35:11.300 --> 01:35:17.980]
Reagan used forceful rhetoric but also small displays of force shooting down Libby and Jester with a Gulf of Cybria to demonstrate American resolve

[01:35:17.980 --> 01:35:23.160]
I don't think you invade a wreck to bring liberty you do it to eliminate an unstable regime because

[01:35:23.160 --> 01:35:26.380]
Sanctions are breaking down and you get liberty as a vi-product to continue

[01:35:26.380 --> 01:35:29.640]
I asked him whether invading a wreck was a good idea knowing what we know now

[01:35:29.640 --> 01:35:37.000]
He looked at me for a bit and said I don't know I don't know I don't know yeah, I like that

[01:35:37.560 --> 01:35:40.080]
I don't know Robert Gates and his brother V Gates

[01:35:41.480 --> 01:35:44.160]
This is really a terrifying 40

[01:35:44.160 --> 01:35:49.120]
Oh, he just went back up to 48. I know is that possible

[01:35:49.620 --> 01:35:52.200]
You know that people get rejected deadbeats

[01:35:56.580 --> 01:35:56.940]
48

[01:35:57.720 --> 01:36:01.780]
48 yet, that's so great. I don't think we're gonna sell them out. I think we're gonna do like the stewbots today

[01:36:03.120 --> 01:36:09.540]
It'll all know never and and of course on the on the eve of tomorrow's big ratings party

[01:36:11.500 --> 01:36:12.860]
This is not a good sign

[01:36:13.800 --> 01:36:17.060]
It's enough to make you just want to put your head in your hands and cry like an infant

[01:36:19.300 --> 01:36:20.900]
Which I've been doing plenty of that

[01:36:23.160 --> 01:36:26.400]
45 now we're starting to make a little bit of a move to find the kitchen on

[01:36:29.140 --> 01:36:31.560]
Many voters undercut it about 2008

[01:36:33.040 --> 01:36:39.020]
Just off the quaint town square of pizza shop owner and an employee took a break to banter about politics one recent late summer day

[01:36:39.020 --> 01:36:43.800]
They didn't always agree but like many others found common ground on the preference for president no one yet

[01:36:44.840 --> 01:36:50.500]
I'm turned off Chad Verstieg 42 a Republican who runs the pizza restaurant pizza ranch

[01:36:50.960 --> 01:36:54.940]
He lamended the mud slinging by both parties and said I don't look forward to this election

[01:36:56.640 --> 01:36:59.800]
I'll tell you I do any emotions because he's gonna be gone. Oh

[01:37:00.340 --> 01:37:05.880]
And it fellal conservative Joe Ruish 36. I haven't followed enough to even come close to picking who to support

[01:37:07.240 --> 01:37:11.140]
For all the time and money the candidates invested large number of voters in each party remain

[01:37:11.140 --> 01:37:16.480]
I'm committed to run willing to change their or willing to change their minds for must before voting begins and

[01:37:16.480 --> 01:37:21.100]
More Republicans fall in that category than Democrats the difference reflects the wide open GOP race

[01:37:21.840 --> 01:37:25.920]
There are several strong contenders who need Julianne for Thompson mid Romney and John McCain

[01:37:25.920 --> 01:37:30.100]
But none's emerged as a consensus of the dispirited Republican establishment

[01:37:31.040 --> 01:37:33.040]
Conversely the Democratic field is more settled

[01:37:33.620 --> 01:37:38.080]
Swooleries got a size of a lead over the most formidable challengers Barack Obama and John and Woods

[01:37:38.080 --> 01:37:43.180]
Democratic voters have indicated they're relatively comfortable with their choices. Thus more picked somebody to back

[01:37:44.300 --> 01:37:48.740]
It's still all very fluid relatively few people have focused a lot on this people aren't fully committed yet

[01:37:48.740 --> 01:37:52.160]
Said Andrew Kohat a nonpartisan poster and director of the Pew Research Center

[01:37:52.160 --> 01:37:57.800]
Generally most people are gonna make up their mind in the month of the primary and some people make up their mind in the final days

[01:37:59.740 --> 01:38:02.460]
How are we doing on this baby any progress at all?

[01:38:04.780 --> 01:38:06.200]
43 really slow

[01:38:08.440 --> 01:38:09.880]
Let's go people. Let's get these things sold

[01:38:11.420 --> 01:38:17.660]
43 and then keep in mind these are cheapies. These are 50 dollars to the forgets for 25 bucks. We've already sold

[01:38:18.540 --> 01:38:19.800]
57 of them so

[01:38:21.220 --> 01:38:23.800]
Well, what does that mean normally?

[01:38:24.680 --> 01:38:25.240]
50

[01:38:26.420 --> 01:38:31.620]
No, we've had 100 on there like you know big chunks baby. They go in chunks

[01:38:32.200 --> 01:38:39.360]
Well, I think 75 to 50 to 31 to 17 to 6 to 5 to 2 to 1 to 0 like that

[01:38:39.360 --> 01:38:43.140]
Just like the numbers on QA under John a fat ass Jolly Joe Bell thought you're fault

[01:38:44.980 --> 01:38:46.380]
41 so that said

[01:38:47.380 --> 01:38:52.160]
But you know what I'll check back with it like we used to say when we're on SU and check back with us later

[01:38:52.160 --> 01:38:56.540]
We might have something you want to hear on the year check back with us later remember those promos. No

[01:38:57.120 --> 01:38:59.380]
I'm not talking to George. You are

[01:39:00.820 --> 01:39:05.020]
Let's remember the WS you in things with Tom Delvita check back with us later. We have

[01:39:05.020 --> 01:39:09.120]
Some other show on it. You're like this piece of crap. You might check back with us

[01:39:09.120 --> 01:39:16.920]
Now the good news is we have provident 19 votes. Maybe that's the problem. They're all busy as hell voting on our pool about the best

[01:39:16.920 --> 01:39:20.540]
Burger in town now we're in the past fun Rutgers 250

[01:39:20.540 --> 01:39:26.560]
Charhut 189 when these 106 stake-in quake 98 in and out 88

[01:39:27.500 --> 01:39:32.480]
White castle 88 Arnold's Royal Castle 84 and after that Rudy's is up to 46

[01:39:33.360 --> 01:39:34.360]
Remember Rudy Kazoo

[01:39:39.600 --> 01:39:41.280]
No, you don't remember Rudy Kazoo

[01:39:41.280 --> 01:39:42.220]
Well, you're not no

[01:39:43.680 --> 01:39:47.420]
40 were selling these by the ones on that thing. I'm getting too depressed looking bad

[01:39:47.420 --> 01:39:53.500]
I'll leave that in Chris's capable of fat hands. Okay. Can you handle it? I think so not a 40

[01:39:53.500 --> 01:39:57.680]
That means we sold 60 those what he would say which I don't know what that means. So what's that supposed to prove?

[01:39:57.940 --> 01:39:59.020]
It means we sold 60 old man

[01:40:05.760 --> 01:40:09.040]
No, see I call him that because I've been with him a long time. Oh that would have how do you rate?

[01:40:09.500 --> 01:40:14.160]
Well, he just keeps telling me to call you old man. I don't like to say does he really yeah, do I?

[01:40:16.820 --> 01:40:19.280]
When you guys have a nice food fight during the break

[01:40:21.960 --> 01:40:25.660]
We'd better be like we're dwindling down to a precious few on those certificates

[01:40:26.980 --> 01:40:31.680]
Because that's just a shot in mind then that's like a kick in a back-to-ass 38

[01:40:32.480 --> 01:40:34.460]
Did Sports

[01:40:34.460 --> 01:40:34.460]

[01:41:30.800 --> 01:41:32.040]

but you don't go fear

[01:42:16.280 --> 01:42:17.660]
we've got a great leader

[01:42:18.280 --> 01:42:20.440]
with President of the

[01:42:24.560 --> 01:42:25.060]
Republican

[01:42:25.060 --> 01:42:25.060]

[01:42:25.060 --> 01:42:25.400]
we've got a great leader

[01:42:25.400 --> 01:42:26.860]
take a piece of

[01:42:26.860 --> 01:42:27.580]
dance we've got

[01:42:27.580 --> 01:42:28.680]
thirty two certificates

[01:42:28.680 --> 01:42:29.800]
for left hand

[01:42:31.940 --> 01:42:33.300]
and the thing still

[01:42:33.300 --> 01:42:34.000]
doesn't work that

[01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.520]
icon still has one on the

[01:42:36.520 --> 01:42:37.600]
left doesn't work for you

[01:42:37.600 --> 01:42:38.860]
yeah works for me

[01:42:38.860 --> 01:42:41.820]
I guess inside the building

[01:42:41.820 --> 01:42:42.660]
if you're inside the

[01:42:42.660 --> 01:42:42.800]
you can see a

[01:42:42.800 --> 01:42:44.220]
QM building in my work

[01:42:44.220 --> 01:42:45.140]
outside the building

[01:42:45.140 --> 01:42:46.620]
forget about it

[01:42:48.440 --> 01:42:49.680]
we're down to thirty one

[01:42:49.680 --> 01:42:50.420]
and there's one

[01:42:50.420 --> 01:42:51.040]
bogus one

[01:42:51.040 --> 01:42:52.800]
so that's back up to thirty

[01:42:52.800 --> 01:42:53.100]
two

[01:42:53.100 --> 01:42:54.900]
you don't find this shocking

[01:42:54.900 --> 01:42:55.480]
and dismay

[01:42:55.480 --> 01:42:58.100]
of course we do have twice as

[01:42:58.100 --> 01:42:58.900]
many as usual you know

[01:43:00.880 --> 01:43:02.220]
you're just parroting that

[01:43:02.220 --> 01:43:11.660]
because he said that there's

[01:43:11.660 --> 01:43:12.500]
something you're off your

[01:43:12.500 --> 01:43:13.480]
rocker there's been several

[01:43:13.480 --> 01:43:14.940]
weeks where we've had a hundred

[01:43:15.760 --> 01:43:16.180]
fifty's

[01:43:18.160 --> 01:43:19.940]
okay that's okay if they don't

[01:43:19.940 --> 01:43:20.980]
want all of them

[01:43:21.700 --> 01:43:23.600]
all come on down there and use them all

[01:43:24.740 --> 01:43:25.940]
that's right and then

[01:43:25.940 --> 01:43:27.380]
the gold one coming what

[01:43:27.380 --> 01:43:28.520]
they're going we're down to thirty

[01:43:28.520 --> 01:43:28.700]
one

[01:43:32.940 --> 01:43:34.740]
that means you sold sixty

[01:43:34.740 --> 01:43:36.020]
nine but don't say it because

[01:43:36.020 --> 01:43:37.620]
Joyce will get upset if you say

[01:43:37.620 --> 01:43:37.840]
that

[01:43:40.660 --> 01:43:42.920]
well see you're not you're not on top of this

[01:43:42.920 --> 01:43:43.840]
every week like I am I

[01:43:43.840 --> 01:43:45.660]
refresh it and I keep watching in fact

[01:43:45.660 --> 01:43:46.740]
during the thirty break

[01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:48.420]
thirty

[01:43:49.340 --> 01:43:51.460]
thirty man well now I feel so much

[01:43:51.900 --> 01:43:52.320]
better

[01:43:53.800 --> 01:43:55.200]
Osama bin Laden will release a new

[01:43:55.200 --> 01:43:56.820]
message today declaring war on

[01:43:56.820 --> 01:43:58.500]
Pakistani president pervert Moussier

[01:43:58.500 --> 01:44:00.000]
Al-Qaeda announced today

[01:44:00.760 --> 01:44:01.940]
the announcement of the upcoming

[01:44:01.940 --> 01:44:03.560]
message came as Al-Qaeda released a new

[01:44:03.560 --> 01:44:05.280]
video which bin Laden's deputy I'm in the

[01:44:05.280 --> 01:44:06.200]
prime in al-Zawari

[01:44:06.200 --> 01:44:08.480]
both of us was being defeated in Afghanistan

[01:44:08.480 --> 01:44:09.680]
Iraq and other places

[01:44:10.840 --> 01:44:12.740]
officials in Pakistan confirmed today

[01:44:12.740 --> 01:44:14.460]
that Moussier is also Pakistan's

[01:44:14.460 --> 01:44:16.240]
military chief would seek a second

[01:44:16.240 --> 01:44:17.700]
five year term as president

[01:44:18.680 --> 01:44:20.180]
speakers in the video promised more

[01:44:20.180 --> 01:44:21.200]
fighting in Afghanistan

[01:44:21.200 --> 01:44:23.460]
North Africa and Sudan's Darfur region

[01:44:23.460 --> 01:44:25.000]
the messages are part of a

[01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:26.800]
stepped up propaganda campaign by al-Qaeda

[01:44:26.800 --> 01:44:28.120]
around the anniversary of the nine-loving

[01:44:28.120 --> 01:44:29.760]
attacks against the World Trade Center

[01:44:29.760 --> 01:44:31.360]
in the Pentagon earlier this month

[01:44:31.360 --> 01:44:33.040]
been released two messages including his

you know i'm not that

[01:56:13.380 --> 01:56:17.040]

[01:56:17.040 --> 01:56:20.560]
right yeah everything on this stage everything shrinking believe you mean

[01:56:22.020 --> 01:56:25.360]
anyway what my was referring to a corner plus was a chapter in the book called

[01:56:25.360 --> 01:56:29.060]
carry one now get over it in which he says millions of votes quite constantly

[01:56:29.060 --> 01:56:32.200]
two thousand four-lifetime were discarded not counted or prevented from being

[01:56:32.200 --> 01:56:35.520]
cast in the first place a fact the author says has special relevance to the

[01:56:35.520 --> 01:56:39.640]
low cal of myers arrest there's an entire dimension here that's not

[01:56:39.640 --> 01:56:42.760]
being covered plus to the controversy the interesting thing to me is a

[01:56:42.760 --> 01:56:45.700]
journalist is at the myers instant occurred in the land to a county florida

[01:56:45.700 --> 01:56:48.340]
one of the worst places in the country for black voters

[01:56:49.580 --> 01:56:52.780]
addressing carry before he's taken away where officers myers sites reports

[01:56:52.780 --> 01:56:56.720]
presumably from police book about this in front chance i would disenfranchise

[01:56:56.720 --> 01:56:59.920]
the reporters in florida oh i don't have any of my mouthful

[01:57:01.220 --> 01:57:04.420]
they were deliberately disenfranchising voters polis set of a lie to the

[01:57:04.420 --> 01:57:06.720]
county home to gainsville's university of florida f.u.

[01:57:07.160 --> 01:57:10.580]
gainsville is horrendous he said and i'm sure more ways than just one

[01:57:11.680 --> 01:57:14.940]
calming the area the center of the attack on a black voter polis pointed to a

[01:57:14.940 --> 01:57:18.160]
two thousand one article that he wrote in the nation which details what he says

[01:57:18.160 --> 01:57:21.520]
were efforts under republican leds state government to purge voting rules of

[01:57:21.520 --> 01:57:25.360]
felons who were convicted in other states eligible voters under florida law

[01:57:25.360 --> 01:57:28.280]
almost half of which may be black according to statistics in the piece

[01:57:29.700 --> 01:57:32.960]
it's one ugly place to apply to also rather than the police's actions in the

[01:57:32.960 --> 01:57:36.420]
myer case palen comparison to intimidation techniques used by authorities

[01:57:36.420 --> 01:57:40.760]
against minority voters during elections as for the tazer admire the office as

[01:57:40.760 --> 01:57:44.860]
he sympathizes i must admit i feel some appreciation for myer he writes at his

[01:57:44.860 --> 01:57:48.120]
website especially because even on him it being shot with untold arms of

[01:57:48.120 --> 01:57:50.660]

seriously our good buddy great-grandson writes some really good crap he's the

[01:58:07.040 --> 01:58:10.220]
best that's why most of his stuff has to be published in britain because the

[01:58:10.220 --> 01:58:13.340]
mainstream media in this country they don't want to touch it because it's too

[01:58:13.340 --> 01:58:18.020]
close to the truth and you know what they feel you can't handle the truth isn't

[01:58:18.020 --> 01:58:21.520]

sexual abuse Brown replied I do not know that

[02:09:57.040 --> 02:10:00.000]
Brown's attorney Peter Kellan objected the question is to whether or not

[02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:03.500]
Southam was a pedophile treatment center bishop Brown admitted that although

[02:10:03.500 --> 02:10:07.800]

he wrote because of witness for the upcoming trial nor did he know when he

[02:10:24.760 --> 02:10:27.740]
expected him back count on point it out there were at least four similar

[02:10:27.740 --> 02:10:32.820]
treatment centers available in the u.s.a. the diocese of orange is posted a spin

[02:10:32.820 --> 02:10:36.840]
versus fact sheet on its website which maintains that urella was not sent to Southam

[02:10:36.840 --> 02:10:40.680]
to flee jurisdiction and avoid testimony but that the recommendation place

[02:10:40.680 --> 02:10:44.040]

pre-psychologist who suggested immediate hospitalization on September 18th

[02:11:03.140 --> 02:11:06.500]
but why in Canada yes my understanding Hennessy said is that this facility

[02:11:06.500 --> 02:11:09.740]
treats a variety of conditions but is uniquely qualified a matters involving

[02:11:09.740 --> 02:11:15.560]
clergy members and understands pastoral life oh yeah Hennessy said plenty of

[02:11:15.560 --> 02:11:18.160]
swords have agreed not to require urella to complete the deposition as long as

[02:11:18.160 --> 02:11:21.680]

Raved about how great it wasn't made a big gigantic move and it went up to 40 and then that was it

[02:17:41.040 --> 02:17:44.640]
I guess all the Rudy's people piled on you know piled on

[02:17:45.440 --> 02:17:48.700]
Now is the end of that 46 I thought it was gonna make a

[02:17:48.700 --> 02:17:52.260]
Astronomical movement up there. You know you ever have an astronomical movement

[02:17:52.960 --> 02:17:54.940]

Duffy's tavern six burger queen three and hot and now only three

I guess not too many people want to eat with a queen

[02:18:32.220 --> 02:18:37.420]
That's four certificates. We have four now. Okay. Well, so it's slowly but surely you know

[02:18:37.420 --> 02:18:40.860]
We're almost built in the day if we can get those four gone by 130

[02:18:40.860 --> 02:18:43.440]
I'll feel like we've had a major accomplishment here, you know

[02:18:43.980 --> 02:18:47.920]
We don't want to have a stoo got situation because it's really embarrassing and people look at that and they go

[02:18:47.920 --> 02:18:48.320]
Ah

[02:18:49.580 --> 02:18:52.920]
Look at that two weeks later and he's still trying to pedal crap from two weeks ago

[02:18:52.920 --> 02:18:56.340]
Because they don't have enough listeners to sell like all the stuff all out

[02:18:57.540 --> 02:19:02.360]
You know you can make up all the phony baloney crap you want and tell you and and they had like three months of wire

[02:19:02.360 --> 02:19:05.980]
Diaries and they're during the last two years. Oh, where are you? Well, we'll see what happens tomorrow

[02:19:05.980 --> 02:19:07.700]
You know, I should know but I'm a big mouth now

[02:19:08.220 --> 02:19:12.560]
Because like I said, I've got a real sick feeling of the pit of my stomach and a good part of it has to do with those numbers

[02:19:12.560 --> 02:19:14.660]
Coming out 10 o'clock tomorrow morning

[02:19:15.420 --> 02:19:19.640]
What do you what's your take George? What's George think? I think it's going to be better than it has been

[02:19:20.200 --> 02:19:21.400]
Which is saying a lot

[02:19:22.500 --> 02:19:30.280]
You really do yeah dropping off a big May I know and including and still hanging on to a horrendous zoom. I know

[02:19:31.420 --> 02:19:35.700]
Oh, I think it'll be better not great. We're just in the right direction. How's that?

[02:19:35.700 --> 02:19:40.060]
I think it'll be up from the previous threat. Well, okay. I'm figure

[02:19:40.060 --> 02:19:43.840]
All right. Well GOP contender mid Romney is launching a radio ad today

[02:19:43.840 --> 02:19:47.760]
Touting is opposition to game marriage. We talked about this yesterday and here's the radio ad today

[02:19:47.760 --> 02:19:50.320]
Well, I'm not here. It is but here here. It's here

[02:19:51.160 --> 02:19:51.880]
It's alive

[02:19:52.820 --> 02:19:57.860]
Romney has been hit by conservatives for being soft on gay issue gay in the past says he is the only

[02:19:58.360 --> 02:20:02.180]
Major Republican candidate backing a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage

[02:20:03.500 --> 02:20:05.760]
I'm more homophobic than you are. Yeah

[02:20:06.520 --> 02:20:09.840]
Not all Republican candidates agree but defending marriage is the right thing to do

[02:20:09.840 --> 02:20:15.800]
Romney says in the 60-second spot targeting. I was evangelical Christians and meant to send him apart from Fred Thompson

[02:20:15.800 --> 02:20:20.080]
John McCain and Rudy Giuliani in the Iowa caucus race who is the most bigoted of them all

[02:20:21.300 --> 02:20:28.000]
Giuliani takes a different approach in his new Iowa radio spot for training himself as the Republican most likely to win over moderate voters in the general election

[02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:32.880]
Many conservatives are a leery of Giuliani because of his views on gay rights and abortion

[02:20:33.680 --> 02:20:34.120]
Meanwhile

[02:20:34.880 --> 02:20:38.880]
Romney said in an online session that he would have not have to agree politically with any appointees

[02:20:38.880 --> 02:20:40.360]
He would seek to present his Supreme Court

[02:20:40.360 --> 02:20:45.720]
But he'd expect them to be strict legal constructionists in the model of chief justice chief justice John Roberts

[02:20:45.720 --> 02:20:53.780]
Oh, you're right. He listed three other conservative jurists, Clarence token Thomas, Anton Antonin Scalia and Samuel Alito as model appointees to the nation's highest court

[02:20:53.780 --> 02:20:56.360]
In other words, I am an Aussie's what he's trying to say

[02:20:57.040 --> 02:21:00.340]
So all you people that are all whipped up about well Mitt Romney looks so good

[02:21:00.340 --> 02:21:04.440]
And he's got that nice haircut almost as good as John Edwards, but not quite as expensive. Yeah, right

[02:21:06.200 --> 02:21:08.580]
A freaking fascist if there ever was one

[02:21:09.580 --> 02:21:13.420]
And see that when you're Republican. That's what you have to do you have to appeal to the base

[02:21:13.420 --> 02:21:16.880]
So here's that that queen with the vest on again that bolt hit a queen on CNN

[02:21:16.880 --> 02:21:21.660]
Oh, I'm not working and he says the Fed has got to have rules out. Can you tell me what this is all about?

[02:21:21.920 --> 02:21:26.280]
I asked you I keep asking this what what is that all about? There must have been a focus group somewhere that said

[02:21:26.360 --> 02:21:27.460]
Airby show

[02:21:27.940 --> 02:21:29.480]
Has to have one token

[02:21:29.480 --> 02:21:35.500]
silly looking queen and hopefully with a vest on right is that what it's all about must be

[02:21:36.680 --> 02:21:40.400]
Like what is that guy the movie critic Michael musto is that the guy you know who that guy is?

[02:21:40.460 --> 02:21:42.140]
No, oh my god

[02:21:42.660 --> 02:21:44.260]
He huh Michael Mayo

[02:21:45.020 --> 02:21:50.360]
Hold the male Michael musto he makes Charles Nelson right to look like hercules even now

[02:21:51.120 --> 02:21:53.060]
Even the charlie in the box

[02:21:54.380 --> 02:21:57.000]
So how are we doing we still got what for yeah?

[02:21:58.140 --> 02:21:59.160]
Well, that's no good

[02:21:59.980 --> 02:22:04.220]
We still got four certificates left and we got 51 minutes to go. Well, if we don't have this hold by two

[02:22:04.220 --> 02:22:10.240]
I'm gonna go and slink off into the distance and never be seen again and even if we do sell mine I might do that

[02:22:11.600 --> 02:22:13.660]
But what do you think of that you think that's a possibility?

[02:22:14.660 --> 02:22:15.020]
What?

[02:22:15.960 --> 02:22:17.500]
Just you know taking off

[02:22:17.940 --> 02:22:22.160]
Because I'm sure I'm sure a person and you are you know trapped in the situation that you are in life

[02:22:22.160 --> 02:22:22.480]
Uh-huh

[02:22:22.880 --> 02:22:25.680]
Which you're always belly aching about and rightfully so uh-huh

[02:22:25.680 --> 02:22:29.380]
Um, I'm sure you've kind of played it that every minute of every day

[02:22:29.380 --> 02:22:30.920]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha

[02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:37.060]
More and more so lately for me. I just think about what especially this new car coming the next couple of days

[02:22:37.060 --> 02:22:38.860]
Uh-huh. I just hop in that beautiful

[02:22:38.860 --> 02:22:41.400]
Sites and drive off into the sunset sure

[02:22:42.060 --> 02:22:43.580]
Drive off into the solstice

[02:22:44.940 --> 02:22:47.700]
10 past one and five sixty-veh-de-que-way in

[02:22:48.820 --> 02:22:56.060]
Oh, what's the problem officer deploy from the vehicle

[02:22:58.160 --> 02:23:03.620]
If you're caught driving without a seatbelt you will be removed from your car and shot

[02:23:04.460 --> 02:23:09.120]
The police now have the authority to enforce seat belt safety under the new Patriot Act 2

[02:23:09.120 --> 02:23:13.120]
The new laws in effect now so click it or be shot

[02:23:13.580 --> 02:23:17.240]
Officers don't like doing this. They are only following orders

[02:23:17.240 --> 02:23:21.240]
It's for your own protection in the never-ending fight against terrorism

[02:23:21.240 --> 02:23:23.580]
Terrorist acts such as mouth noise

[02:23:24.820 --> 02:23:26.760]
curping and fighting

[02:23:26.760 --> 02:23:32.780]
But the annoyance you others so under Patriot Act 2 eating will no longer be permitted in restaurants

[02:23:32.780 --> 02:23:37.600]
Anyone eating outside the designated eating area will also be shot

[02:23:38.660 --> 02:23:40.080]
It's the law

[02:23:41.200 --> 02:23:42.480]
We like saying that

[02:23:42.480 --> 02:23:44.600]
The law

[02:23:47.860 --> 02:23:48.940]
It's the law

[02:23:49.540 --> 02:23:54.500]
It's the law maybe 1315 we still have four on me that's on the pole 1315. That's not bad

[02:23:54.500 --> 02:23:58.960]
I don't think we're going to make 14 but 1350 is within reach Chris and then they will fear you

[02:23:58.960 --> 02:24:00.700]
No, we're down to one we're down to one

[02:24:01.460 --> 02:24:06.800]
See what we can do that. I can buy myself for Christ's I'm not going to do it because that would be cheating and then they talk about me

[02:24:06.800 --> 02:24:12.000]
Oh Neil Rogers has to buy his own certificates on the 50 50 thing to get over there like that, you know

[02:24:13.160 --> 02:24:14.240]
I don't want that

[02:24:14.680 --> 02:24:19.040]
We're gonna now sharpen arrived in Las Vegas this morning to vote most to support for O.J. Simpson

[02:24:19.880 --> 02:24:22.260]
And raise awareness about racism in the desert

[02:24:22.680 --> 02:24:26.940]
Oh, come on. He's back in China now. He's a sternum all up. He's throwing the pot

[02:24:26.940 --> 02:24:29.440]
And Jesse he's smoking it

[02:24:29.440 --> 02:24:32.960]
When informed O.J. was being served only vanilla pudding for desert and jail

[02:24:32.960 --> 02:24:39.820]
The else spoken sharp and called on all people of color to unify against the bigoted policies rampant in erud regions around the country right

[02:24:39.820 --> 02:24:44.800]
They should be serving in chocolate pudding everybody knows that my guy bill Cosby would be really peered about that

[02:24:44.800 --> 02:24:46.500]
I bet that even jello j.e. yellow

[02:24:46.500 --> 02:24:53.920]
I thought racism was bad in the big city decried the rotund river and but do you know there ain't a damn naturally

[02:24:54.500 --> 02:24:59.740]
Formed what monolith there ain't a damn naturally formed monolith in this whole country named after a brother

[02:24:59.740 --> 02:25:01.080]
Oh everybody

[02:25:01.800 --> 02:25:08.040]
Then quoting from the coasters Charlie Brown. He said why is all why is everybody always picking on me and started to cry

[02:25:09.400 --> 02:25:16.140]
Is he a crazy person or why why is everybody always picking on me and he started to cry the rotund reverend

[02:25:18.720 --> 02:25:19.300]
Oh

[02:25:29.740 --> 02:25:36.060]
He's a sharp and water clown. Oh boy. Now of course they're all in Gina, Louisiana, baby with a banjo underneath

[02:25:37.380 --> 02:25:43.760]
It was under the carpet. We came to pull the carpet up if there are roaches and we turn the light on

[02:25:43.760 --> 02:25:47.260]
Don't blame us for being those that get rid of roaches

[02:25:47.260 --> 02:25:51.900]
Yeah, okay, you all know something about roaches. Okay, because he's probably got a couple of the anstereic

[02:25:53.480 --> 02:25:58.140]
Attorneys for a young man sexually abused by former Catholic priest who was also his great uncle

[02:25:58.800 --> 02:26:00.340]
I guess he wasn't so great, huh?

[02:26:01.740 --> 02:26:03.560]
Soot church. What does that mean great uncle

[02:26:04.860 --> 02:26:08.720]
Like um your father's uncle I think I believe I'm not sure

[02:26:09.780 --> 02:26:10.740]
I'm speculating

[02:26:11.680 --> 02:26:16.200]
Soot church officials today allegedly knew for decades that the priest was abusing children

[02:26:16.200 --> 02:26:19.780]
But did nothing to warn the public reading his own family. This is in Wilmington, Delaware

[02:26:21.600 --> 02:26:28.080]
Francis Delucas 77 was sentenced by a New York judge earlier this month to 60 days in jail for repeatedly molesting his grand nephew

[02:26:28.140 --> 02:26:30.140]
Michael Dingle 18

[02:26:30.680 --> 02:26:34.640]
He liked to dittle with Dingle and his berries. Oh, no

[02:26:34.640 --> 02:26:41.680]
But the look who pleaded guilty to one count of second to be sexual abuse two counts of third to be sexual abuse and two counts of

[02:26:41.680 --> 02:26:46.140]
And they do the welfare of a child return to his hometown of Syracuse in the early 1990s

[02:26:46.140 --> 02:26:51.580]
After being dismissed from public ministry in Delaware where he was accused of sexually abusing a minor 30 years earlier a

[02:26:51.580 --> 02:26:55.720]
Great uncle is the brother of one of your grandparents also called a grand uncle

[02:26:55.720 --> 02:26:56.440]
Hmm

[02:26:59.060 --> 02:27:03.080]
Exactly he was arrested in October right now. Do we get rid of that last one era Chris?

[02:27:04.220 --> 02:27:09.040]
Yeah, we got one to go 25 dollars for a 50-dollar certificate to left these the food is sensational

[02:27:09.660 --> 02:27:10.380]
Yes, it was

[02:27:11.660 --> 02:27:15.060]
Wtqm.com we got one to go let's get that thing sold and stop making us

[02:27:15.060 --> 02:27:21.840]
Have to like beg like a dog on its hind legs. Okay. Get with it. We're doing you the favor and act like they're doing us a favor

[02:27:22.480 --> 02:27:22.920]
Bastards

[02:27:23.800 --> 02:27:27.280]
Anyway, the look who was arrested knocked over after Dingle told his parents

[02:27:27.280 --> 02:27:31.320]
He'd been sexually abused by the looker from the time he was 12 or 13 until the age of 17

[02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:34.300]
The look was served in Wilmington for 35 years

[02:27:34.300 --> 02:27:40.460]
Dingle's attorneys alleged that officials with an ICC's a woman into as early as 1958 that the looker was molesting young boys

[02:27:40.460 --> 02:27:44.860]
But did nothing to stop him the Saudi instead to shuffle him around from parish to parish how unusual?

[02:27:45.280 --> 02:27:46.120]
What a novelty

[02:27:46.780 --> 02:27:51.880]
Shortly after the looker was arrested in New York last fall woman can bishop michael sulfur rally released the names of

[02:27:51.880 --> 02:27:57.460]
20 diocesan priests including to looker against him that ICC's had substantial allegations of child sex abuse

[02:27:58.220 --> 02:28:03.920]
Attorney Steven Newberger said diocesan officials had a duty to warrant church and soul authorities in New York about to looker

[02:28:03.920 --> 02:28:09.420]
But failed to do so and they failed to use reasonable care to protect children from him well

[02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:12.020]
So many of these isolated incidents you know

[02:28:12.940 --> 02:28:13.340]
And

[02:28:14.960 --> 02:28:18.760]
And there's all the protesters running around there in jena in jena lousiana

[02:28:20.100 --> 02:28:21.620]
That's in the news in the news

[02:28:25.200 --> 02:28:28.440]
1320 are full on the burger pool nice job there uh by the way random

[02:28:28.440 --> 02:28:32.280]
Where's the pulpit of marvel for christ's sake although I do have all these trolley b-poles

[02:28:33.800 --> 02:28:37.700]
Yep, I mean this I don't know is this man lost his mind or what

[02:28:38.780 --> 02:28:39.660]
So absolutely

[02:28:40.100 --> 02:28:42.000]
Well we're sold out we're sold out

[02:28:43.300 --> 02:28:48.620]
It's unofficial they're gonna recheck and re-evaluate and they're gonna like pass it by boopus and talk us and stuff like that

[02:28:48.620 --> 02:28:51.140]
And then we'll be sure if there's anything left we'll tell you

[02:28:51.960 --> 02:28:55.140]
Because I know that there's a whole bunch of people just chomping at the bit

[02:28:56.200 --> 02:28:56.620]
Oh

[02:28:57.580 --> 02:28:59.860]
Now look at this look at the pool from trawley b

[02:28:59.860 --> 02:29:05.740]
I think the college keystone cops all spelled with k's mm-hmm who tasted the goofball guy fascist you

[02:29:06.620 --> 02:29:10.300]
And then when that's not a bad pool. I'm gonna have to change that first part but I you know

[02:29:11.020 --> 02:29:13.980]
The college keystone cops with the k charlie, you know

[02:29:13.980 --> 02:29:16.480]
Here's a guy's ready getting carried away with himself. That's obvious

[02:29:16.480 --> 02:29:18.780]
When he sends me an email this morning

[02:29:18.780 --> 02:29:20.780]
Padding himself on the back for what a great job

[02:29:20.780 --> 02:29:26.660]
But what a great show that I just did with erosmith and how I even played once on you had never heard before proving that you know

[02:29:26.660 --> 02:29:27.860]
You learned something on this show

[02:29:29.560 --> 02:29:33.180]
A pastor who admitted to sex charges involving two girls in kenteno

[02:29:33.180 --> 02:29:36.100]
Has been sentenced to two years in four months in prison

[02:29:36.520 --> 02:29:38.380]
They sentenced in hardened county

[02:29:38.980 --> 02:29:39.360]
That

[02:29:40.040 --> 02:29:42.520]
Against Paul leftler could allow him to serve just one month

[02:29:43.480 --> 02:29:49.900]
Prosecutors say leftler used his position as pastor of freedom of the spirit church in kenteno to get close to the teenage girls real close

[02:29:50.400 --> 02:29:53.420]
They say he had sex with one girl. He's been trying to get close to another

[02:29:53.420 --> 02:29:56.500]
Well, if you're gonna have sex with him you got to get fairly close. I would think it helps

[02:29:57.240 --> 02:30:02.340]
Leftler being guilty to gross sexual imposition. He didn't say anything before the sentencing. Yes, cherd day

[02:30:03.460 --> 02:30:04.640]
Another isolated incident

[02:30:06.280 --> 02:30:11.860]
All right, let's get back to that pull now and we got we are sold out as which is that keep your eye on it to make sure that we don't have a bunch of come like

[02:30:11.860 --> 02:30:14.520]
Top and back up will do

[02:30:14.520 --> 02:30:17.980]
I mean a hundred. Yeah, I guess I guess you're right. It's a lot

[02:30:18.320 --> 02:30:21.280]
Like listen when you got like maybe 200 people listening. That's officially sold out

[02:30:21.920 --> 02:30:26.800]
Visually sold out. You're positive. You're 100% sure. Yeah. Did duff come in there give you a big pat on the ass

[02:30:26.800 --> 02:30:31.860]
No, he said he wanted to give you a kiss though. No, Jesus. Hey duff you fair not for me

[02:30:32.520 --> 02:30:33.580]
Nist from here, baby

[02:30:35.140 --> 02:30:35.860]
124 votes

[02:30:36.580 --> 02:30:38.760]
You know if we'd have forgotten not forgotten

[02:30:38.760 --> 02:30:43.100]
But if we would have begun a little bit easier on selling the certificates, because if we did on that we wouldn't have sold them

[02:30:43.540 --> 02:30:46.340]
If we'd have really pushed the pull we could have made 14 hundred again

[02:30:46.720 --> 02:30:49.320]
Which would be twice in one week during the show

[02:30:50.560 --> 02:30:54.740]
Now even George who's very skeptical of all these numbers. I toss her around and all the polls stuff

[02:30:54.740 --> 02:30:56.720]
Yeah, what kind of and really doesn't care at all

[02:30:57.320 --> 02:31:00.840]
Even he would have to admit that that it has to be a sign of something

[02:31:01.800 --> 02:31:04.140]
Yeah, yeah, maybe there were a few people like

[02:31:04.140 --> 02:31:07.580]
Struggling out of the show here. It's a sign maybe it's a hand sign

[02:31:09.820 --> 02:31:11.620]
Maybe it's a high sign

[02:31:12.720 --> 02:31:17.800]
High sign driven by George Napolitano, Jr. at Pompe no Park. Is that place still open or what?

[02:31:18.160 --> 02:31:18.620]
What

[02:31:19.200 --> 02:31:23.200]
Pompe no who does the best burgers came from or come from

[02:31:23.200 --> 02:31:26.100]
Fudruckers 274 in Characters 203

[02:31:26.100 --> 02:31:28.260]
Fudruckers still as a substantial lead

[02:31:28.900 --> 02:31:30.060]
When these 110

[02:31:30.620 --> 02:31:33.660]

In and out 93

[02:31:36.560 --> 02:31:39.420]
Arnold's Royal Castle ladies so how can we set Arnold's Royal Castle?

[02:31:40.240 --> 02:31:43.560]
I mean we love weighing in all that but shouldn't it just say we're all castle? There were a whole bunch of them

[02:31:43.560 --> 02:31:47.440]
Should and yes, yeah, that's what it should say hey Eric if you can do that for us

[02:31:47.440 --> 02:31:52.560]
He can do it. We love weighing our own but just take Arnold's off of there and just put Royal Castle because we just got white castle

[02:31:53.100 --> 02:31:58.060]
Although Arnold weighed Arnold's the last one going and it's still he had the big fire last year was it last year?

[02:31:59.160 --> 02:32:00.280]
Earlier than that before that

[02:32:00.280 --> 02:32:04.860]
Taking it long time but he's we've got a very very marginal neighborhood and he's you know one of these days

[02:32:04.860 --> 02:32:07.160]
He'll be open again 87 for Arnold's Royal Castle

[02:32:07.920 --> 02:32:10.500]

You ever have the shroom burger? I think I might have the shroom burger when we go to Carol on the weaned in Hardies all the time

[02:32:27.520 --> 02:32:31.940]
You know what there used to be in upstate New York having to work there were anywhere else was carols

[02:32:31.940 --> 02:32:33.080]
Have we talked about this before?

[02:32:33.800 --> 02:32:36.220]
Not that I can recall C-A-R-R-O-L

[02:32:36.220 --> 02:32:41.980]
Well, however they spelled it carols they had really great fries and marginal burgers and they had like ice cream and crap

[02:32:43.060 --> 02:32:46.120]
Carol that was like in Rochester in upstate New York boy that's 100 years ago

[02:32:46.580 --> 02:32:48.780]
It's like talking about Don and Bob's again. Oh

[02:32:49.300 --> 02:32:51.540]
Don and Bob's had the best but that wasn't in South Florida

[02:32:53.040 --> 02:32:58.220]
Crystal 28 Sonic 24 McDonald's 23 Jack in a box 21 big boy 16

Five guys nine Vick and Irvings eight which was a similar to Don and Bob's and also Rochester place

[02:33:06.860 --> 02:33:12.740]
And I was here for about five minutes in South Florida for a lot of deal. Oh all those rochesterians are gonna come flocking in here to

[02:33:12.740 --> 02:33:13.720]
Vick and Irvings wrong

[02:33:14.380 --> 02:33:17.840]

[02:33:36.560 --> 02:33:38.500]
Mm-hmm. I would pick the never part for that place

[02:33:39.320 --> 02:33:41.880]
1332 on our award winning poll on eowarges.com

[02:33:43.240 --> 02:33:47.540]
I hope you're right about those numbers tomorrow because that's gonna determine the future of my life

[02:33:47.540 --> 02:33:53.200]
You know, not I mean one trend is is everything right but if it's really is horrendous and grotesque

[02:33:53.200 --> 02:33:56.620]
I might just look at it and go and then they just just silence you know

[02:33:58.340 --> 02:34:02.240]
I might just go and wipe my butt real good one last time and hop in my new car

[02:34:02.240 --> 02:34:04.900]
If I if I had it but then which I seriously doubt and I hope I don't

[02:34:07.080 --> 02:34:07.440]
I

[02:34:09.800 --> 02:34:10.160]
Know

[02:34:11.220 --> 02:34:11.580]
I'm

[02:34:11.580 --> 02:34:13.980]
I'm a North leader hey

[02:34:16.280 --> 02:34:18.200]
Spent of palmin or

[02:34:18.200 --> 02:34:20.960]
Poverts over this performance by the golfing

[02:34:22.760 --> 02:34:28.340]
Welcome back to ESPN's NFL of all con team selection show on Matt Franklin. I'm Ted Brewster

[02:34:28.900 --> 02:34:34.600]
And that's a remarkably resilient Lewis who will be talking to one of our all con team selections momentarily

[02:34:34.600 --> 02:34:38.880]
Well, we have our defense now. Let's take a look at our offense. I mean offense

[02:34:39.600 --> 02:34:45.300]
We started wide receiver and Antonio Bryan of the San Francisco 49ers two words that best described Bryan

[02:34:45.840 --> 02:34:51.900]
Speedy and elusive apparently not to elusive from the long arm of the law following his DWI charge great point math

[02:34:51.900 --> 02:34:57.340]
Our next selection is Cincinnati Bengals Whiteout Chris Henry the Bengals uniform is known for its stripes

[02:34:57.340 --> 02:35:04.540]
But prison stripes might be more appropriate for Henry fire arms possession assault and a DUI hey if it's true that

[02:35:04.540 --> 02:35:08.820]
He's a great athlete right on matt at running back on our NFL preseason all

[02:35:08.880 --> 02:35:16.680]
Con team is Ruben drones of the Cleveland Browns. He assaults opposing defenders with his hard running style and apparently assaults family members as well

[02:35:17.360 --> 02:35:22.300]
And finally a quarterback. It's none other than Michael Vick organized the dog fighting ring

[02:35:22.300 --> 02:35:23.160]
funded it

[02:35:23.160 --> 02:35:28.020]
Chilled some dogs personally, but what a fucking good athlete well put right now

[02:35:28.020 --> 02:35:32.320]
Let's send it down to our rubbing recovering reporter Lewis who's with Michael Vick in his pit bulls

[02:35:43.320 --> 02:35:43.840]
Now

[02:35:43.840 --> 02:35:53.000]
Now that's what I call an offensive unit with some serious offenses. Well, that's all the time we have thanks for tuning in the ESPN's NFL all-con team selection show

[02:35:53.760 --> 02:35:59.000]
To the next week as we select our NFL all-con cheerleading squad so on

[02:36:00.260 --> 02:36:04.400]
1131 at 560 W2M. Don't forget it's uh hurry canes game day today

[02:36:04.400 --> 02:36:10.260]
Maybe starting in 3 30 year to the man doll. We got hurricanes up the old back don't shoot boy. We got more hurricane crap

[02:36:10.260 --> 02:36:11.920]
They have a lot of spots in there too. I'm sure

[02:36:11.920 --> 02:36:16.560]
Mm-hmm now there's a Joe and who else is on those games? Joseph Yankee with who?

[02:36:17.220 --> 02:36:20.040]
Um, they do yeah the game's actually Josie and Don Bailey

[02:36:20.800 --> 02:36:28.020]
Yeah, and I think the much alive farm with scoreboards from uh they each do like 65 70 live spots during the pregame show

[02:36:28.020 --> 02:36:28.620]
No

[02:36:29.260 --> 02:36:33.400]
And like and like during between between the snaps and again seven steps

[02:36:33.400 --> 02:36:39.500]
I never heard ever hear that promo again where he says seven steps drop. I'm gonna kill somebody and maybe I'll

[02:36:39.500 --> 02:36:42.140]
Where's the guide? Why I can play for you. No, I don't want to hear it

[02:36:44.040 --> 02:36:50.040]
I'm actually breaking out of my deep depression. I'm you know because because we sold all certificates now. I mean, it's took a while

[02:36:50.980 --> 02:36:57.360]
In fact, let's look back on that thing. Okay. Let's look back on a page with the stats because I'm just mailing it anyway

[02:36:57.360 --> 02:36:58.300]
Mm-hmm

[02:36:59.240 --> 02:36:59.900]
emailing it in

[02:37:01.860 --> 02:37:06.940]
Yeah, we're emailing it in and let's go over that page. Let's see if it doesn't go over there. What do you want to know?

[02:37:08.620 --> 02:37:11.960]
Let's click on this one little tiny banner looks like a band-aid

[02:37:12.800 --> 02:37:19.080]
Okay past deals okay, um-hmm past deals blue moon fish company sold out an hour and two minutes first time

[02:37:19.080 --> 02:37:20.400]
They've been on a couple of times

[02:37:20.900 --> 02:37:24.780]
Then last week we sold them out in nine minutes, but that was only Fiddy you know Fiddy

[02:37:27.360 --> 02:37:33.360]
So it's a wide variety and now let's see do we have one that took a long long time one hour 55 minutes Joseph's on the grill

[02:37:34.440 --> 02:37:35.380]
Joseph's on the water

[02:37:36.040 --> 02:37:37.600]
Well, it's the same thing

[02:37:38.960 --> 02:37:40.320]
Joseph is on the grill

[02:37:41.100 --> 02:37:45.020]
Next is like you know Jesus and Mary for crying out on this night's all that you know

[02:37:46.060 --> 02:37:48.700]
You're going to Joseph's on the water. Yeah, not on the grill

[02:37:49.640 --> 02:37:51.520]
Why don't your ass on the grill why not

[02:37:52.280 --> 02:37:57.740]
Our 55 and then of course we said that the reason for that being that nobody knew the place because it was new and it was hard

[02:37:57.740 --> 02:37:59.880]
You couldn't see it from the road and stuff like that

[02:38:00.580 --> 02:38:01.380]
Remember that

[02:38:01.380 --> 02:38:05.300]
There is swelery looking like a real pretty bitch

[02:38:05.300 --> 02:38:10.580]
By the Republican Congress back in 1997 when senator Hillary Clinton was herself in the White House

[02:38:10.580 --> 02:38:15.060]
Very familiar with this program. That's right. Uh present Clinton present bus this morning

[02:38:16.680 --> 02:38:20.040]
I need to realize how care is out there

[02:38:20.760 --> 02:38:22.620]
Well, it's neither fair nor

[02:38:24.160 --> 02:38:30.160]
reflective of what the bipartisan support well, what is the big stimulus with her other than her last name is Clinton and she's married that's right

[02:38:30.160 --> 02:38:32.420]
What what is it? I mean what's the rest of it?

[02:38:32.440 --> 02:38:37.040]
But what's the life that's in it with any other one always saying what's not to like in her case? What's to like?

[02:38:38.280 --> 02:38:39.660]
Nothing the ice princess

[02:38:40.680 --> 02:38:44.640]
So now does it say what we did today would left these on her yet or not one hour 20 minutes

[02:38:45.060 --> 02:38:47.620]
Well, that's not so bad. That's not the all-time longest one

[02:38:48.600 --> 02:38:54.700]
And again, it's because we had a hundred river house hour and two minutes once upon a time that must have been a hundred

[02:38:56.640 --> 02:38:57.360]
Correct correct

[02:38:58.220 --> 02:39:03.060]
So what do you get all excited about? I don't know. I'm sorry. What are you getting all the press and negative about up?

[02:39:03.340 --> 02:39:06.560]
Look on the bright side, you know always look on the bright side

[02:39:06.560 --> 02:39:10.540]
Have a big smile on your face even even on payday in your case, which I know is easy

[02:39:12.020 --> 02:39:13.820]
Well, I got kind of a nice payday today

[02:39:14.440 --> 02:39:16.640]
Why is that because that was 105 hours

[02:39:19.480 --> 02:39:21.040]
At what 275?

[02:39:21.520 --> 02:39:22.280]
relevant one that

[02:39:23.820 --> 02:39:26.380]
1349 in the pool. I'm telling you we could have made the 14 easy

[02:39:26.960 --> 02:39:29.460]
Now it's dubious. I don't think we're I mean it's possible

[02:39:30.200 --> 02:39:35.540]
It's easy everybody's got a favorite burger joint. I would think unless you're you know what other category would have could have put on there

[02:39:35.540 --> 02:39:37.660]
I'm a vegetarian. Oh, yeah

[02:39:39.460 --> 02:39:43.800]
Yeah, well, you know, that's right up your alley. You love those people from pay to huh?

[02:39:43.820 --> 02:39:47.360]
Yeah, eat a pizza person or I'm not a burger eater

[02:39:48.900 --> 02:39:52.800]
We could put both I'm a vegetarian. I'm not a burger eater. I'll put them on now

[02:39:53.620 --> 02:39:58.480]
Like Oprah remember that before when she got sued by those goofballs in Texas and they should have won by the way

[02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:02.920]
And then come to find out that Dr. Phil was the attorney that won the case that makes me sick

[02:40:04.740 --> 02:40:10.180]
That just makes me stop cold before putting another burger in my fat mouth or whatever she said remember that

[02:40:11.380 --> 02:40:15.080]
Just stops me cold. I got news for a honey you stopped me cold

[02:40:16.860 --> 02:40:21.120]
I was watching Jack caffity on CNN last night. They had some special um

[02:40:21.120 --> 02:40:25.120]
Hour with him. I were to feel since they can't pull his on's ass

[02:40:26.320 --> 02:40:28.300]
And I enjoyed Jack caffity's good

[02:40:29.220 --> 02:40:34.060]
And he actually has something to say and then he had a wippy goldberg on there and all of a sudden my channel changed to another station

[02:40:34.060 --> 02:40:35.280]
Coincidence. No

[02:40:36.080 --> 02:40:39.000]
It's programmed like that. I can't look at her. I'm sorry

[02:40:40.800 --> 02:40:46.340]
1353 on there. We could make 14 under we need 47 votes in 25 minutes. It's like two a minute

[02:40:47.420 --> 02:40:51.460]
So tall order for this grab especially the way they're acting up today man act up

[02:40:52.420 --> 02:40:54.940]
That's what they're doing. They're acting up and schoolries on air

[02:40:54.940 --> 02:40:59.680]
He is what I wanted to be sure that I'm presenting to the American people you know this week

[02:40:59.680 --> 02:41:04.120]
I came out with uh and a comprehensive healthcare plan that I think would cover

[02:41:04.120 --> 02:41:08.200]
She's starting to sound a little bit like we had a cause. I mean probably she's doing a lot of speaking and stuff like that

[02:41:08.200 --> 02:41:12.100]
But she started to get that real scratchy. You know what I mean? I'm good

[02:41:14.580 --> 02:41:16.380]
Seriously anybody who ever wonders

[02:41:17.660 --> 02:41:22.440]
About the sanity of mankind and about and trying to rationalize things to make no sense at all

[02:41:22.440 --> 02:41:26.000]
Just listen to read your cause, babe. Although I don't see her anymore. Thank goodness

[02:41:27.000 --> 02:41:29.440]
Maybe that's why viewership is going up on MSNBC

[02:41:29.440 --> 02:41:36.920]
But just watch her for like 10 seconds and listen to her speak and ask yourself how can this person be in broadcast?

[02:41:37.560 --> 02:41:40.640]
You know, it's like I like that and like Lenny Martez

[02:41:40.640 --> 02:41:47.160]
How can all these people who can't speak? How could Bobo Wawa who's got this horrible speech defect make millions of dollars being on television

[02:41:47.160 --> 02:41:51.480]
She can't even say it. How could Tom Volkow be doing that and not only you as he could even say it

[02:41:52.140 --> 02:41:52.580]
Yeah

[02:41:54.060 --> 02:41:56.580]
Don't confuse us with the facts, man. You just you know

[02:41:58.700 --> 02:42:00.240]
All this crap I just

[02:42:01.400 --> 02:42:05.000]

[02:42:11.740 --> 02:42:19.560]
See this this we do we talk about it at the time. It's like lunacy if it fails over there we take it if it fails over here they take it

[02:42:20.960 --> 02:42:24.500]
Like I told you it's like like training baseball cards

[02:42:26.640 --> 02:42:30.280]
It's like the hot potato you take him we don't want him. No you take him

[02:42:31.900 --> 02:42:34.500]
Hey Mikey, maybe Michael take him Mikey likes him

[02:42:35.640 --> 02:42:36.320]

Yeah, I bet you I mean and that's it

[02:43:01.360 --> 02:43:06.320]
I can't eat cereal because it's all carbs man, and then you put milk on it, and I can't drink I'm not gonna drink cow's milk

[02:43:07.160 --> 02:43:08.760]

Unleashing a big frockey, you know

[02:43:28.460 --> 02:43:32.660]
That's what the orthodox Jews do they have a big frockey is that what it is oh, yeah

[02:43:32.660 --> 02:43:37.240]
And if you're not orthodox like in Brooklyn, they'll come right to your door. They'll knock on the door and go

[02:43:39.180 --> 02:43:39.900]
Like that

[02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:48.460]
Mickey Mouse's walk that's Mickey Mouse making mr. Mellow. Oh, I didn't think I was gonna get you

I understand now you enjoy women that have hairy legs that's you know to ages on I understand and

[02:46:39.700 --> 02:46:44.280]
Okay, well, I mean, I just don't get it all right. Well, this has been

[02:46:44.280 --> 02:46:47.360]

Yeah, I want to have a meeting with okay, all right. Oh mother line dring

[02:46:59.200 --> 02:47:04.240]
145 branded means put it what I say Brandon is pushing me to get that 14-hour votes push it push it

[02:47:04.240 --> 02:47:06.220]
But we're not gonna do we're gonna fall short. Sorry sweetie

[02:47:07.360 --> 02:47:11.900]
1366 I know we're gonna fall short because we need 34 votes in 14 minutes. That's just not gonna happen

[02:47:12.260 --> 02:47:16.320]
Not in the cards, you know, I every time you think the audience is gonna come through for you big time

[02:47:16.320 --> 02:47:18.260]
And this pull was on fire, baby

[02:47:18.780 --> 02:47:23.960]
And I thought for sure writing those two categories. I'm a vegetarian. I'm not a burger reader would like you know a place for people to go

[02:47:25.300 --> 02:47:31.300]
You know, I mean what do you mean? You know what I mean about place for people to go where it's really hot and it burns all the time

[02:47:31.300 --> 02:47:33.940]
There's a lot of those have any votes they both have the big O zero

[02:47:35.680 --> 02:47:39.360]
Like I said, we got two bogged down and if I would have taken my time

[02:47:39.360 --> 02:47:44.160]
We still would have sold out this certificates, right? Yeah, my fault. I'll take all the blame for it. Not Chris today

[02:47:44.160 --> 02:47:48.180]
Because he's got a rough day today. He's got to work the next 75 hours

[02:47:49.560 --> 02:47:54.260]
Because clearance is an idiot wants to punish you for being on his show and actually being associated with the show

[02:47:54.260 --> 02:48:01.860]
We need 33 votes in 14 minutes ain't gonna do it. We got 1367 on the burger pull the burger master

[02:48:03.580 --> 02:48:07.320]
Oh, how I hate to get up in the morning is that where he says something about the burger master in that song

[02:48:07.320 --> 02:48:12.140]
I don't know what the burger isn't the burger master the bugler or something what are you talking about the burger master?

[02:48:12.140 --> 02:48:15.360]
It's in that song. What's on what's all how I hate to get up in the morning

[02:48:16.300 --> 02:48:21.700]
Is that like a made up song or something? No, it's a army song. Oh, how I hate to get up in the morning

[02:48:21.700 --> 02:48:23.900]
You know that's hot so it's from

[02:48:24.460 --> 02:48:25.480]
When you were in the army

[02:48:26.840 --> 02:48:29.020]
What you sang it when you were in the army?

[02:48:30.920 --> 02:48:33.140]
No army archer used to sing it

[02:48:33.140 --> 02:48:34.900]
Remember army archer who is the movie critic

[02:48:34.900 --> 02:48:38.740]
With the new brothers like not as big as Andy Rooney. Well, it's on TV or radio

[02:48:39.360 --> 02:48:42.420]
What without a TV or radio TV army archer

[02:48:43.260 --> 02:48:48.880]
You sure you guys need to get a little house. Yeah trust me. I'm out of 20 more votes in 13 minutes

[02:48:48.880 --> 02:48:52.700]
It's not gonna happen. Sorry Brandon. I'm trying out by some pushin. I'm pushing. I'm pushing

[02:48:53.540 --> 02:48:54.600]
Here's some bad news

[02:48:55.380 --> 02:49:01.300]
New York's got nothing on us neither the Chicago Los Angeles or Atlanta says this on central when it comes to inflation

[02:49:02.360 --> 02:49:10.720]
South Florida has the highest annual rate of the major metropolitan areas tracked by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics Equated the latest rankings released yes, Turd day

[02:49:11.840 --> 02:49:19.940]
The mommy for a lot of day on annual inflation rate of 3.7% for July and August beats the nation's annual inflation rate of 2% by a long shot. Wow

[02:49:21.200 --> 02:49:22.800]
Now what do they can't afford those certificates?

[02:49:23.120 --> 02:49:28.840]
And they can't even afford to a vote on the poll might cost them something see that's the thing I don't understand it costs nothing to vote on the poll

[02:49:29.740 --> 02:49:33.440]
And just because a well sucks and if you know 18 people voted in

[02:49:33.960 --> 02:49:37.900]
In 7500 blocks within around you. Oh, you can't vote. That's all excuse

[02:49:39.420 --> 02:49:44.260]
Right right. We got 1372. We're gonna have me 28 and 12 minutes not gonna happen

[02:49:44.260 --> 02:49:46.100]
We're gonna fall just short and then we'll be depressed

[02:49:46.840 --> 02:49:48.640]
All the rest of the day we're gonna be depressed

[02:49:49.880 --> 02:49:53.800]
Rent and the price of eating out are among the cost that are increasing the most sharply in South Florida

[02:49:53.800 --> 02:49:57.180]
Government figures all that's definitely two said Vincent Evans

[02:49:57.720 --> 02:50:03.260]
Software at FAU whose budget is straining under the price of gasoline. Thanks again for low gas prices Mr. President

[02:50:04.120 --> 02:50:09.800]
Utilities even fast food. He said he and his friends have mastered the order of figuring out the cheapest fast food items

[02:50:09.800 --> 02:50:12.080]
We are dollar menu errors. He said

[02:50:13.320 --> 02:50:19.240]
During the past 12 months the Bureau of Labor Statistics said right in the area has jumped

[02:50:19.240 --> 02:50:23.540]
7.4% far faster than nationwide 4% annual pace

[02:50:24.200 --> 02:50:28.800]
Although the figures don't specifically include Palm Beach County inflation certainly doesn't stop at the county lines

[02:50:29.320 --> 02:50:36.060]
The other measure of housing costs is something called owners equivalent rent which economist Kieran Ransom said is what a homeowner would charge to rent out his or her

[02:50:36.060 --> 02:50:41.280]
House that figured jump 9% in South Florida three times the three percent increase nationwide

[02:50:41.960 --> 02:50:43.800]
Why the government doesn't have an answer

[02:50:43.800 --> 02:50:50.200]
But local landlords have suffered from steep property tax increases as well as insurance cost rises just as homeowners have

[02:50:50.960 --> 02:50:55.880]
If there's a good thing about the new figures it's that they aren't going up quite as fast as they were earlier this year in June

[02:50:55.880 --> 02:50:58.860]
South Florida's inflation was also the highest among major major areas

[02:50:58.860 --> 02:51:05.140]
The BLS reported prices were climbing at 4.4% annual rate. I mean for a lot of deal at the recent peak and early last year

[02:51:05.140 --> 02:51:07.540]
Rising at a 6.1%

[02:51:07.540 --> 02:51:09.300]
annual rate

[02:51:11.480 --> 02:51:15.520]
While South Florida's prices were going up the consumer price index nationwide actually went down

[02:51:15.520 --> 02:51:19.580]
The national index fell 0.2% longer for the first time it's tumble since last fall

[02:51:19.580 --> 02:51:23.040]
So in other words another good reason not to live in South Florida. I don't want to be you know

[02:51:23.040 --> 02:51:25.760]
Negatory chamber of commerce will get really upset with me about that

[02:51:26.240 --> 02:51:27.720]
And it would be the first time too

[02:51:28.180 --> 02:51:31.080]
So how are we doing on there? We're gonna make that 1400 not

[02:51:33.260 --> 02:51:34.260]
1300 and what?

[02:51:35.040 --> 02:51:35.440]
79

[02:51:36.220 --> 02:51:39.120]
We need 21 hosts in 10 minutes. That's just two a minute

[02:51:39.680 --> 02:51:44.600]
You folks could do it if you're hot pile on it and we have one vegetarian and one not a burger reader. Oh

[02:51:44.600 --> 02:51:44.920]
Right

[02:51:45.600 --> 02:51:51.040]
Yeah, see those categories help this well. I mean if we may if we just barely make it by the skin of our ass

[02:51:51.740 --> 02:51:56.440]
It'll be because we added those categories. How would I wouldn't you think we have a whole bunch of it your vegetarians on there?

[02:51:57.120 --> 02:51:58.140]
I imagine no

[02:51:58.940 --> 02:52:01.220]
Only a couple you think

[02:52:02.920 --> 02:52:03.360]
The

[02:52:03.360 --> 02:52:09.920]
Hasry only one so far and then we're not making any progress on there. We've got nine minutes and we need 21 votes

[02:52:10.400 --> 02:52:14.680]
That's over two a minute not gonna happen grand enough. Oh sorry 1380 we need 20

[02:52:15.300 --> 02:52:18.520]
This is really pushing it right to the limit boy. He people could do it

[02:52:19.240 --> 02:52:23.520]
If these people really cared enough to send a very best in typical non-South Florida fashion

[02:52:23.520 --> 02:52:26.800]
Easily we could do the 1400 for the second time this week

[02:52:27.440 --> 02:52:32.460]
And make and give us a good feeling a good rosy feeling about life and wouldn't want you to feel better

[02:52:32.460 --> 02:52:37.120]

[02:53:00.740 --> 02:53:05.980]

[02:53:59.560 --> 02:54:04.520]
So what do we got we have 13 what are you telling me 1387 we need 13 in seven minutes

[02:54:04.520 --> 02:54:06.820]

[02:54:31.220 --> 02:54:37.360]
Are you sitting down? Yes, I'm afraid I have some bad news for you. What do you mean bad news?

[02:54:38.600 --> 02:54:42.780]
Um, I understand that Bob's been with us for almost 20 years now and Bob's okay, is he?

[02:54:42.780 --> 02:54:50.340]
Oh Bob's fine. Oh a little upset but fine. He's been a good worker for us. He's made all his quotas his bonuses of always been in line

[02:54:50.880 --> 02:54:53.100]
Um, but we're gonna have to let him go

[02:54:53.660 --> 02:54:56.140]
What do you mean? We're gonna have to fire him and

[02:54:57.000 --> 02:55:00.780]
Unfortunately being the boss sometimes you have to do things that you're not very pleased doing

[02:55:00.780 --> 02:55:02.360]
That's not very fair

[02:55:03.320 --> 02:55:06.980]
He's been very loyal to you. Yes, he has like a slap in the face

[02:55:06.980 --> 02:55:11.100]
Um, I can imagine you failing that way absolutely, but

[02:55:11.100 --> 02:55:15.100]
Feeling that way you don't understand we just had a baby. Yes, I understand

[02:55:15.820 --> 02:55:20.160]
The in-yang understood this is a very hard time to do this kind of a thing

[02:55:20.160 --> 02:55:24.780]
I fully agree with you, but there's something is happened down here at the office that that we can't overlook

[02:55:24.780 --> 02:55:28.780]
It's an it's an image problem and a problem that you might want to address yourself

[02:55:29.420 --> 02:55:33.340]
Um, I don't look quite how to tell you though. Why are you firing him?

[02:55:40.120 --> 02:55:40.560]
Um

[02:55:40.560 --> 02:55:42.460]

Well, I can understand you being upset at this point, but

[02:55:47.240 --> 02:55:53.920]
That's a good one. Son of a bitch. I can't believe this well. Um, he's gonna need your support through it

[02:55:54.520 --> 02:56:00.760]
Right now he's on his way home to you and he's got another thing coming when he gets from

[02:56:00.760 --> 02:56:03.000]

[02:56:03.000 --> 02:56:03.460]

[02:56:10.940 --> 02:56:12.740]
