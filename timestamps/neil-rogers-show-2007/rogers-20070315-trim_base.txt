[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.360]
Don't care how many day go get any what free spot gun bars come out of the woodwork

[00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:07.220]
They're breaking up with me in a birthday card.

[00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:08.700]
Well, they don't make virgin up cards.

[00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.140]
I'm fire, I see all of them.

[00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:12.880]
Beacuse you'll go be sick.

[00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:14.340]
You just have to be a bad day.

[00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:15.720]
I've had a bad day.

[00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.180]
Subscribe to this pew-bad day.

[00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.240]
Because you have a bad day.

[00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:21.780]
You take it one down.

[00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.540]
Take this down the floor.

[00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.120]
Just turn it around.

[00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.000]
Take it down the floor.

[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.520]
Tell me no more.

[00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.100]
You're gonna smile when you go for a ride.

[00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:33.720]
Yeah, it's a bad day.

[00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:34.800]
Yes, he's been fired.

[00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:35.700]
You fired.

[00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:37.640]
You need to pack everything and go.

[00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.420]
Now that's when I call a bad day.

[00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.400]
Alright, look, I've gotta hang over to those who have been.

[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.540]
He lost his generals in the fight.

[00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.440]
He's just been arrested.

[00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.060]
We've lost our mojo.

[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.580]
I think I'm going to be sick.

[00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:51.280]
You're fired.

[00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.780]
I've got one going in.

[00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.540]
Yeah, it's a bad day.

[00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.060]
You're killed, don't lie.

[00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:57.780]
You're killed, but it's bad.

[00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.540]
You're killed, but it's bad.

[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:00.280]
You're killed, but it's bad.

[00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.260]
Yeah, it's a bad day.

[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.200]
I'm too low for this.

[00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.400]
I saw this drunk guy throw up.

[00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:09.700]
And then a pigeon ate it.

[00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:10.280]
He broke up.

[00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:11.780]
He cheated on me.

[00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:12.460]
I got kicked out.

[00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:13.640]
She dumped me and broke my heart.

[00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:14.440]
You broke your penis.

[00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.920]
I paid my ass with just not the wet pipe.

[00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:20.560]
Then a one guy there is,

[00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:21.520]
is I have one going in.

[00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:22.200]
What's wrong with that?

[00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.100]
What do you need a pair for?

[00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.940]
You know, when you come right down to it, what do you really need to?

[00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.800]
It's like a pair.

[00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.980]
So you have a pair of pair.

[00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:27.700]
Why a pair of pair?

[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.240]
It's what you need to dress for when you can have one big round one right there in the middle of your chest.

[00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.900]
And by the way, Mariah, Louis still ain't interested.

[00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.600]
Okay, hey, Louis.

[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:35.220]
You're fairly.

[00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.660]
I notice he's on our main MySpace page thing there.

[00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.940]
He's on.

[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.900]
I never noticed that before.

[00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.020]
There's a picture of Louis Miguel.

[00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:42.700]
How they have forgotten, you know how?

[00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.160]
We better start getting some of that Louis Miguel music on again.

[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:46.320]
If you'll let me know.

[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.300]
I'll crank it up.

[00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:49.440]
You got?

[00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:50.920]
Got Louis Miguel?

[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.220]
I Louis Miguel.

[00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.120]
I put it into the computer here so that I could make you that data desk.

[00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.060]
Remember for your parents?

[00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.460]
That's right.

[00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:58.040]
That is correct.

[00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.880]
And it's still there.

[00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.460]
I think that's one of my greatest all-time accomplishments on the Legendary Neararajer show as Beckman.

[00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:08.760]
It was simultaneously casting us in Tampa and that Unchist Redneck Yehu knows picking horseball town called Tampa on W. West U.N.

[00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:13.080]
And I actually had Redneck's by in the Louis Miguel records in the records deris in Tampa.

[00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:14.420]
I know that for a fact.

[00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:15.320]
Remember we see it calls.

[00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:17.500]
We don't want to overdo it though.

[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.520]
What's that got to do with Mariah Carey?

[00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:20.500]
Hey Mariah, guess what?

[00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.960]
Yeah.

[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.880]
Well a little more, you know.

[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.920]
You might occasionally dabble on that side but not too often.

[00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.620]
1118 votes on yesterday's pool.

[00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:29.840]
Now what was the story?

[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.280]
That's where we had the ball game yesterday.

[00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.100]
Anybody know that the Marlins winner loses.

[00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:34.880]
Anybody know that there's anybody care?

[00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.140]
No.

[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.980]
I didn't think so.

[00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.880]
Exhibition goes.

[00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:38.340]
Yeah, the 151.

[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:39.220]
All right.

[00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:40.500]
Let's hear we love the Marlins.

[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.080]
In fact, the game was probably so simple-ating that we ought to replay it starting at 11 this morning would be good.

[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.960]
I think that's a plan.

[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.680]
I like it.

[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:47.140]
I like it.

[00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.360]
I like it.

[00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.900]
Excellent.

[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.680]
And even though I have another losing day at Woodbine, which seems to be every trip there pretty much mostly, but not that bad.

[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.680]
In other words, it was a marginal plunge.

[00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:57.220]
How's that?

[00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.880]
Now what Hank was in there the other day, he's confabulating with me during a break.

[00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.140]
And I sure wish I could have heard what he was saying but Chris had the...

[00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:05.700]
Well, it's not your fault.

[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.260]
He's getting better.

[00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.660]
Yeah.

[00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.340]
I could barely hear the offer.

[00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:16.060]
But anyway, he was going on about, hey, he's been winning so much lately and his gambling exploct in his legendary.

[00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.280]
The legendary gambler, Hank Goldberg, is he going to be on today or what?

[00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:20.320]
Let's take a look at that schedule.

[00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:21.440]
Today is the Ize of March.

[00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:22.880]
I just mentioned that in passing.

[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:25.160]
Ize of March.

[00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:26.240]
Everybody knows what that is.

[00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.620]
Uh-huh.

[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.480]
Mad Dog at the Rival Sports Wheel at 2 o'clock.

[00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.360]
That at 4 to 5 it's the power hour with Hank and the Mad Dog together at the Rivals.

[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:35.300]
What does that say?

[00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.660]
At Rivals, Cop at Rivals.

[00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.320]
What does that mean?

[00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:40.660]
Oh, that's the wrong shot.

[00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:41.000]
I don't know.

[00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:42.440]
He's the uptake guy.

[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.980]
Produced a seat.

[00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.100]
Well, well, whatever.

[00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.160]
So, clearance had so much to write on here that he just couldn't handle it.

[00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.420]
He just crumbled into the pressure, which he's already doing.

[00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.500]
Nice job on those numbers, by the way.

[00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:57.140]
clearance, you're building us up to a nice solid one share across the board.

[00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:58.200]
Nothing like consistency.

[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.000]
Hank at Rival Sports Grill from 5 to 7.

[00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.380]
So that's what works all going on today.

[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:04.360]
Then you got your Panther preview at 7.

[00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.840]
I heard him this morning and now I shut the monitor office as soon as I heard that voice.

[00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:09.220]
Panther preview at 7.

[00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.080]
Panther is on the Saber's at the Macarena at 7.

[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.860]
30 and then followed by ADK from Vegas.

[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.440]
Well, everybody is somewhere, you know?

[00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:20.460]
Well, that's the Mad Dog in a Humpler at Rivals and ADK is in Vegas.

[00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:21.540]
And he was in Toronto.

[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.760]
But I mean, but I mean, but I mean, all this stuff.

[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:24.340]
All of these.

[00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:26.240]
All of these things.

[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.580]
Here's the pull from me today speaking in silly things.

[00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:29.720]
This was discussing, you know?

[00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.340]
But you think you own a apology to the audience.

[00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.580]
And by the way, Chris will be pleased to know since we have a full four-hour show today.

[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.200]
I'm not really happy about Kenny promoting everybody should be watching at 8.

[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.940]
He didn't really put it that way, but you know why remind people?

[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.300]
Why remind us it's like saying well this is the show we got on coming up next, you know old NEO

[00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.260]
It's got nothing to do with sports and with college hoops

[00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:54.360]
But 1230 get on a barcalauger and bapapaya. Barc here allows you this. Okay you jackass

[00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.820]
I think they got to take that square table and you know just turn turn the thing over on his ass

[00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:03.900]
They will have all your march madness updates right here. Yeah good. I got now. I'm sure I'm gonna be able to in fact

[00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.500]
I'll tell you what because we're so sports intensive on the station because our program director and the people at

[00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:13.780]
Owners station are sports nerds. Maybe we just put the audio from that on here. I mean which animals are gonna be on Chris?

[00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.840]
Well, uh, yeah, I'm sure it'll be on it's gonna be on what?

[00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:21.260]
CBS. CBS. CBS. Well CBS. Well CBS. Here is the channel

[00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:27.140]
16 is CBS. Well, I like that. Watch the local bus. We'll do the play by 16 all the time. Here's an on tell

[00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:29.480]
We're gonna show you how it has made

[00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:34.160]
Escape therapy a very heavily well. Oh, XK therapy with Montel there we go XK

[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.620]
That's like being X so you're X alive or something. Anyway, we're getting back to this X human

[00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:44.240]
The most embarrassing bodily function older or abnormality that could happen to me with other people around is

[00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:49.580]
Cutting a louder bad smelling fart boy. They ain't nothing close to that. It's a good thing. It's not close boy

[00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:55.000]
591 I think I've had an excellent point yesterday. I don't want it well on it. I don't want to linger on it too much

[00:05:55.480 --> 00:06:00.960]
But the same you follow what I was saying what you saying to you if you're alone in the room and you do it

[00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:05.120]
You're thinking oh man. It's really great. You know, right especially if it's loud

[00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:11.260]
No, no, no, that's not you have your rip one. That's good. I usually do that in the bathroom and the more when I'm shaving

[00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.000]
You're just before I hop in the shower before I get in the shower

[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.280]
Which really pisses me off because they when you do it in the shower

[00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:20.380]
That's when you can really enjoy all the hot and steamy flavorful aroma

[00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:26.080]
That's really a few sticks in the bathroom are really good too. So farting and seeing sounds much better and reverberates on all my glass

[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:29.660]
So on a wall sounds like a riddening rate and but if somebody else melted

[00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:35.540]
Oh, geez who died in here. Yes, I don't know. It's the same. It's the same exact substance in the year

[00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:38.460]
But it's just a matter of perspective I guess you know

[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:45.180]
Cutting a louder bath smelling fart 591. I didn't say that by the way Joe Joe gets very very upset and nervous when I say anything about

[00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:48.600]
Farance. I'm sorry. There's no such things as far just it's just imagination

[00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:53.820]
Bad breath. Don't listen. Don't go there. Okay. If you're smart don't fart

[00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:58.240]
Bad breath 127 sneezing and shooting snot 88

[00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:04.580]
You think it's an enjoyable experience, but it's not I hate this pull 87 7.7 percent well

[00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:09.620]
You know they they just they hate everything it's a soft Florida fn. Way and that's because there's a lot of unhappy people there

[00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:12.020]
And of course if I was forced to be there against my better judgment

[00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:17.320]
I'd be pretty po2 luckily. I'm here and I'm not there. Oh kiss the ground in Toronto, baby

[00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:20.160]
And yesterday again was like 58 I think yesterday not today

[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:23.220]
But it's a little preview of spring up north

[00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:28.120]
I'm getting another expected stiffy in my pants 59. We won't touch that well

[00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:33.940]
Spit flying out of my mouth while talking 33 having a fishy smell women it says, but not necessarily

[00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:38.240]
28 there's some oriental people I hate to say this but oh boy

[00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:42.780]
Smelly under arms 26 in fact they smell a little bit like Luca Brasi because they sleep with the fishes

[00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:47.980]
It's a decision message. It means Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes

[00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:55.360]
Smelly under arms 26 a pimple on my foot 20 a food between my teeth 20 visible nose or ear hair 13

[00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:58.240]
Stomach rumbling 13 like my dentist was doing there on Monday

[00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:02.540]
Although, you know, I think that made it a little less the previous Monday was much more

[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.620]
Aggravating to me a lot more pressure and he had that big red rubber ball in my mouth. You know, I felt like choice

[00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:14.740]
But this Monday I think the fact that his stomach was rumbling kind of like it was a distraction of that version

[00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:18.460]
And I was thinking more about that than the fact that the pain was so grotesque

[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:23.080]
In fact, obliting finally stop today. It's only Thursday Dan Roff in my hair nine

[00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:25.760]
You better get head and boulders baby burping for

[00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:31.740]
Disgusting oh and you know in in Holland in I can't say in Holland because I never really been

[00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:34.000]
I've been haven't been like you tracked and all those other great

[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.560]
Tide cities, but I'm stood on

[00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:40.620]
They do that they go out of their way to Belfast lot

[00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:45.580]
Chinese you that too or is that just something that Chinese people say that's what I heard

[00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:52.440]
I never heard the no jinx to that Chinese or the Japanese one of those you know people one of those Asian groups of people

[00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:57.840]
Burp it's supposed to illustrate or what it's a statement that you're enjoying your meal or something. Oh, I see

[00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:59.960]
I'll make you work your suit

[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:05.020]
It's your noodle bacon is more when you shut up already Jesus God. All right. All mighty

[00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.760]
Chrysler motors burping for and the numb for having the hiccups

[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:13.480]
Which other than that chick that's been hiccoping for about five years the one over there on the west coast

[00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:18.780]
Listen if you live in Tampa or loops or one of those plays you'd be hiccuping a lot too at least it at least it takes your mind

[00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:22.120]
Like I'm talking about a diversion with the dentist. It takes your mind off the fact that you're there

[00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:30.300]
And women with a facial hair telltale must have it none because that's that's not a bodily function or abnormality

[00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:34.620]
It's just if they wanted to shave it off the beard and the mustache they could do it. Maybe it's a fashion statement

[00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:38.880]
You never know. Mm-hmm. WQ. I am hello. When you're doing sure. Okay, yeah

[00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:43.400]
So that's our poll from yesterday the one day we got it like I started telling Chris a moment ago

[00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:45.900]
We got a lick eight hundred and twelve votes already

[00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:51.080]
So confidence is very high this I don't know why I even paid any attention to this

[00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:52.800]
But the Sun sent on made such a big

[00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:59.080]
Sinus out of this it's almost like when steak and shake first arrived in time remember that few years ago. Yeah

[00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:05.300]
Why do you say it would such a dismal everybody's making me a huge deal about it

[00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:09.660]
But what there's one place open way out in Yenum's belt no, there's out by my house

[00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:14.840]
It's like that's that yeah, it's out there by the bottom of the belt and that's not the only one is plenty of steak and shakes

[00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:19.320]
They're shaking it and they're staking it I never see like oh they got the best shakes at stake and shake

[00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:25.540]
It's right there on sunrise. What are you talking about mine? You better get with it man because you just don't weigh out here

[00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:32.940]
So in other words the sunrise and plantation acres is way out you under now the belt see the enemy's out. Yeah

[00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:39.940]
Go I am talking it is sure you only hear this on QA and the only radio station in North America where you'll hear go

[00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:42.100]
I'm talking it is or anybody talking you

[00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:45.320]
It's a question here in Tulsa. That's the way you say

[00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:50.460]
They're coming off the deal with some now once pace off coming up by the way when's past over we know Easter is like April

[00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:55.280]
Sixth is good Friday. I guess the eighth is Easter something like a week before or something right?

[00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:58.200]
What is it and right there?

[00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:03.220]
We before I don't know if the Jews have a head start program. What does that mean the week before I will did that happen

[00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:05.740]
Is it a little bit too difficult for Chris to turn around?

[00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:08.160]
I've got somebody sent me out on our thought on a calendar

[00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:12.880]
It's not going in there. What is it a calendar for goiam? It's not a calendar pass over

[00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:19.260]
Where we're very soon is gonna be passing off pacidickey candy Stabby buddy whatever the hell that means and get a little bit of wine

[00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:24.320]
Little later on the summer last summer was a saider maybe that Jesus Freak was a Jew man

[00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:29.600]
James was a weak for what the week before on Sunday on the second

[00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:30.740]
April

[00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:35.800]
Well, so that means I'm taking off an extra week of vacation is that the week you're gonna be off?

[00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:39.320]
That's why judges on vacation a week for pace off. That's right. I'm gonna have my last

[00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:42.920]
I'll have a season pace off as they say and I have no idea what that means nor do I care

[00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:47.600]
Does it mean that is it's all about to go to go 12 minutes after 10 at 560 WQ in

[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.100]
Rogers, huh? This court lines you

[00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:51.220]
Get ready

[00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:53.980]
For this

[00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:01.500]
I can't believe this I could actually go to jail

[00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:13.100]
Right they said he's guilty all the way

[00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:15.140]
He lied and now he's

[00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:19.600]
Just need to see him go

[00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:28.840]
So the saliva just to get us to war the whole story was I can't say

[00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:29.760]
Live

[00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:33.500]
Hall of Burton sky high while we're getting poor

[00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:36.580]
That will never be able to afford my attention

[00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:44.060]
Push and Jamie must have been high to think we let them ruin our lives

[00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:46.980]
And we just need to see them gone

[00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:50.740]
Live behind a bad day

[00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:56.000]
Shooters going down give the fence a song about to dig it in out

[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.700]
It's what you are told

[00:12:57.700 --> 00:12:59.980]
Teenie said to lie there

[00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:00.900]
I'm going down

[00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:04.460]
That's why you let us say

[00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:06.360]
Clear a lie

[00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:09.560]
Long down to you and see you time

[00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:10.680]
It will be yourself

[00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:12.100]
Hey

[00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:15.260]
You in the face

[00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:21.060]
10 18 at 560 WQ I am there to be great used to be great want to be great

[00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:24.540]
That's what Bruce Beasley told me we are going to be the best damn sports station

[00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:28.780]
And I looked at him and I thought I don't know a sports show you clown you use silly person and he said well

[00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:35.900]
You know I believe in a honest days work for an estate pay days pay and I got out my banjo and I went then I am down down down down down like that

[00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:38.580]
I'm not a smile that then I'm a damn it and you plot as guitar

[00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:45.660]
I'm ready to run Paul nine-term Texas Congressman who hates George Bush like poison and ripped the war in Iraq and he's gonna run

[00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:50.280]
He announces candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination yesterday is anybody care?

[00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:56.020]
No anybody know Ron Paul. No anybody give a flying no no I just mentioned that everybody wants to be president

[00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:59.020]
I think you know who we need to bring back for a little comic relief I

[00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:04.500]
Give up who let's see wait a minute. Let's just let me just find the right fit. Here we go

[00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:10.580]
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah go up your sleeves and do do do but at the end you know

[00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:14.820]
Roll up your sleeves get out the old man. How many times you have to watch and I ain't gonna man. Yeah

[00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:21.260]
You're not the old studies lift up the hood go to mat all these things

[00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:23.940]
You know

[00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:30.060]
Well, that's really said Ross P roll man and obnoxious little bastard with big years

[00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:33.540]
Although I sure would have been better than what we got right now of course then again

[00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:37.380]
So it would have anything else it's kind of like the programming crosses three dead air would be anything

[00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:41.280]
And just about what they got on here and that's why it's just amazing to me, but I don't want to go into that again

[00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:46.880]
Okay, so I tease this before and you just kind of let me off the hook for old times sake. Oh, it's taking that

[00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:53.400]
Time can't do it challenge

[00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:59.220]
And that was kind of interesting because you know time Hagen wasn't in the muscle into the family

[00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:05.000]
Mm-hmm, but he could flex his muscle when he needed to when he kind of like gave the knot of the head like yes stick him in a car and

[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.620]
You know, it'll be an accident and somebody got hurt anyway. It's not even open yet

[00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:14.360]
But the new cross brings chickfully is already drawn crowd. It's a oh man. It's open now though

[00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:17.220]
Well, why is this a story?

[00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:22.580]
You think they're you think the people from the Sun sent a lot are like eating a freebies there or something like that

[00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:27.940]
There's nothing I despise more than people eating free meals from radio stations and newspapers. Oh, I'm sorry

[00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:34.260]
Now see that's that's the perk of being in a business if you can't get your free meals and what the hell's the point of even being in it, you know?

[00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:37.240]
Especially for you guys chickfully

[00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:41.240]
Now what I've seen it. I mean, I know it's a chicken joint

[00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:45.020]
What's the deal with that the nation's second largest fast food chicken chain?

[00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:51.660]
Mm-hmm. I'm sure we know what the first one is like right next door there a KSA begin to run crowds of groupies to its new coupe and

[00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:55.040]
Coral Springs really as they anticipate if it's grand opening today

[00:15:55.540 --> 00:16:03.140]
They were they were a wow. They were all gathered around yesterday for chicken. Oh, I got to I got to blow my nose all right

[00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:09.440]
Well, it's not it's not good. I want to keep going. That's disgusting. Yeah, oh man

[00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:11.240]
Yeah

[00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:17.040]
How much better. Thank you. Well, let's see. It's informal here because there's nobody around

[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:22.000]
I got like a drawer over there. I got all those old AC and this can air along with little hanky spanking case

[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.940]
I sneeze and mong all over myself

[00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:27.700]
Oh, not good more than 50 people while a crowd

[00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:34.860]
That's like bigger than the audience. We got a certain day parts more than 50 people flock to the restaurants a new standalone restaurant a

[00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:40.580]
1341 North University drive and start to camping out to be among the first 100 people for today's opening

[00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:46.360]
Which has already happened if you miss the opening of Chick-fil-A and Coral Springs, you missed it. Damn it

[00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:53.900]
The restaurant opened for breakfast at 6 this morning in the first hundred patrons got 52 coupons for a one-year supply of Chick-fil-A meals

[00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:56.380]
Well, no one that they were all lined up but your free loaders

[00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:04.620]
52 coupons for a one-year supply of Chick-fil-A meals the Coral Springs location is the first free standing Chick-fil-A drive-through and

[00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:07.040]
Broward well, that's very

[00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:14.780]
That's like saying that the CN towers the world's tallest free standing building which it is usually they are they're all in malls and stuff the Chick-fil-A's

[00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:21.480]
Oh, so this is I guess that says most of the chains other area restaurants are mall-based if you would let me get hold

[00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:24.180]
Sorry last sentence here. We would have known that but you know

[00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:29.280]
That's fine. You got to be Mr. Smarty pants. We know that you know it all and that's great. I'm happy you know it all because I don't know much

[00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:34.940]
What the Atlanta based company plans to open more than a dozen new locations in software the next three to five years

[00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:40.880]
And this is written by Jacqueline Jovas at the Sunsendel and if you're sick of this give her a call all right

[00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:44.020]
I will oh what is that they have good chicken sandwiches?

[00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:46.920]
That's their big thing but also their other big thing is waffle fries

[00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:51.780]
Waffle fries I like waffle fries. I don't like regular fries, but I do like waffle fries

[00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:56.620]
They're good. You know what really sounds good to me is cheese waffle fries. She's walking that does

[00:17:56.620 --> 00:18:00.040]
Is that what they call? I do believe they have those in crystal

[00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:04.840]
I'm not really sure and then of course and we have that one lonely crystal on powerline road somewhere that everybody calls

[00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:08.960]
About whenever I bring that up and I don't have any idea where it is you wonder what really care because

[00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:11.600]
Because with crystal the burger was about like like I

[00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:16.640]
Or any teeth of an ounce and the bun is like fluffy and big and all carbs and what what you know what I'm saying

[00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:22.280]
Yeah, the bun is like fluffy not that huge but just compared to the burger. It's gigantic. It's monstrous

[00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:23.040]
Q a.m. Hello

[00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:30.680]
Think about the chip for lay as you walk in and built like a chicken now. Yeah, okay a coupe where you ought to be

[00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:32.360]
WQ a.m. Hello

[00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:39.880]
Thinking now speaking how you doing good? I just rode by the chicken flag flooded with people really

[00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:44.380]
Yeah, they're out in the street their wave and hey come on ever to check in and all that kind of stuff

[00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:48.840]
No, I'll be damned well. Let's go do it. Don't get hooked in there, man. There's like three people there. I think

[00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:55.440]
Oh, so I don't know what this is maybe it's my allergies acting. I'm allergy to work

[00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:58.640]
See when you're off at 1250 like we were yesterday for the ball game

[00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:03.160]
In fact, I was out of here so fast that my can't bear wasn't even down there yet

[00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:05.480]
He's always a few minutes early, you know because I told him on the clock

[00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:08.240]
And I was downstairs at five to one and I called him up

[00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:13.000]
But I said hey listen where are you you crazy terrorist bastard? No, I didn't say that he's a good guy terrorist

[00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:15.060]
Dominic Q a.m. Hello

[00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:17.660]
Neil yes, sir

[00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:17.720]
right and you want to definitely when you pull up to that right through just keep your head low

[00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:22.300]
Because it's not the greatest area, but the hamburgers are outstanding

[00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:24.600]
Yeah, absolutely

[00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:27.180]
A crystal what are you talking about?

[00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:27.740]
Good

[00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:34.300]
If you're in the right mood for those little sliders or whatever you call me if you're in the mood for that they don't win

[00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:39.380]
Arles I'll tell you that by the way, Wayne if you're out there listening somewhere call us again one of these days when you're ever gonna open up again

[00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:44.660]

[00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:56.520]
Although anytime you're in Tampa you're so depressed and so anxious to get out of there that what you do is you

[00:20:56.520 --> 00:21:01.580]
The one on Dale Mabry is always good to pull off to the drive through and you just open up the truck and say fill her up

[00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:05.420]
Maybe they've thrown in about four thousand of those greasy little cheeseburgers those sliders

[00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:10.520]
And then you get some of them cheese fries to get your and you get that among all of the steering wheel as you're driving

[00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:15.980]
It's really good and then you get on the highway and you just you're for it. Just get there out of there as fast as you can

[00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:20.460]
And you head for loops and the temple terrace all of those places

[00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:27.240]
genetic well

It's like the missing link on that part of the state is something missing there like I think it's in breeding

[00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:36.140]
There's all those centuries of inbreeding that could be like in Tennessee like a Nashville

[00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:37.460]
You've got a love Nashville

[00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:44.620]

[00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:55.860]
And then we had like 600 calls all of which were the same person by the way, but nevertheless had a lot of response on it

[00:23:56.940 --> 00:23:59.620]

It's a horrible national anthem. It's an awful song and it just makes the only one I ever sang it right was Jose Feliciano

[00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:34.820]
Remember that he sang it

[00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:04.540]
What about 894?

[00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:05.120]
What did I say?

[00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:06.300]

894.

[00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:10.360]
So it'll be well on our way to the top of the arrow.

[00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:13.080]
It'll be way over 900 and Chris has really pumped up about that.

[00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:14.400]
He's jumping for joy.

[00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:15.180]
Why?

[00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:16.160]
Definitely.

[00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:19.580]
Yeah, I think that's a great idea.

[00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:20.720]
That was Brandon's idea.

[00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:21.500]
Thanks a lot, Brandon.

[00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:23.200]
By the way, the two videos you put on.

[00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:25.820]
There's a two-you cheater that you're no longer.

[00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:26.400]
What does it say?

[00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:27.620]
They're no longer available.

[00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:28.680]
They're no longer available, right?

[00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:29.400]
Yeah.

[00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:30.760]
So I appreciate that very much.

[00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:33.240]
And George keeps telling me I got to see the South Park episode.

[00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:33.980]
Oh, yeah.

[00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:36.400]
Even more so than last week, although both of them.

[00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:39.320]
They're about different things and both of them are must see.

[00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:40.820]
Well, I'll be scouring for that.

[00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:42.560]
Since there isn't any hockey games in Italy,

[00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:43.360]
so play the lot in the wild.

[00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:43.780]
Replay the lot in the wild.

[00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:44.640]
I believe I'll play your part.

[00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:46.820]
It'll, you know, you might mess yourself.

[00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:47.580]
It's so funny.

[00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:48.460]
Really?

[00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:50.060]
Well, I'll be sure and have the depends on.

[00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:52.940]
A Senate Republican is calling for attorney general.

[00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:54.500]
I don't stop with his fire alarm.

[00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:55.500]
I mean, how long can he go?

[00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:57.680]
Beep, beep, beep, beep.

[00:28:57.900 --> 00:28:58.720]
Oh, my God.

[00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:00.320]
Beep, beep, beep.

[00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:00.580]
I'm going.

[00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:02.700]
Oh, and also speaking of the morning,

[00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:04.820]
sure, I'll get back to this in Alberta, VO5 in a minute.

[00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:07.520]
Speaking of another reason to rip them and ask, you know,

[00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:10.480]
I, like I said, keep them honored down as low as possible,

[00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:12.400]
because I really just can't handle that square table

[00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:14.740]
and get your not straighter buyer upside down.

[00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:19.380]
Or, you know, but somehow Tim Hardaway came into the conversation

[00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:20.060]
again this morning.

[00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:21.380]
In Kimber both campers.

[00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:22.500]
See, it's a fraternity.

[00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:23.520]
It's this sports fraternity.

[00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:26.820]
Birds of a feather, all the jocks, all the guys that take showers naked together,

[00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:27.660]
they stick together.

[00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:30.900]
And so all I heard was, Kimber said, well, you know,

[00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:32.480]
it wasn't that much of a big deal.

[00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:33.680]
And Timmy will be all right.

[00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:36.800]
And, you know, I'm sure he probably hasn't changed his mind of what he said.

[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.080]
But, you know, God, you guys said worse things than that.

[00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:41.080]
Timmy this and Timmy that Timmy Timmy.

[00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:42.480]
Sounded awfully familiar to me.

[00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:43.180]
Timmy Timmy.

[00:29:43.340 --> 00:29:44.500]
Sounded like they were doing something.

[00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:46.700]
Maybe, maybe, Bo Campo would like to share with Timmy Hardaway.

[00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:48.800]
Really was.

[00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:52.180]
It was just grotesque and unacceptable and embarrassing and humiliating to me.

[00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:54.440]
You know, if he would have made some comment about all you crackers,

[00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:55.540]
whatever like that.

[00:29:55.580 --> 00:29:58.800]
But because it was a fag comment, that's still socially acceptable America,

[00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:02.920]
especially among in jock circles, you know, audio pansies, audio faggots,

[00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:04.720]
audio guys who are light and alophers.

[00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:06.880]
You know, Mad Dog West, you know, light and alophers.

[00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:11.460]
I know some gay guys who are picking all of our jocks,

[00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:14.820]
including Bo Campo, up with one hand and just smash them together.

[00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:16.180]
Just give them like an airplane spin.

[00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:17.920]
900 votes on the pool.

[00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:22.300]
And I would see, do you think I really care about Tim Hardaway or what a dumb jock like that says?

[00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:23.620]
What does anybody care, you know?

[00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:24.580]
I don't write down to it.

[00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:29.180]
So, when we come back after the very Chris is going to start talking about black people.

[00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:36.080]
Black, black, teen red bird is black, black.

[00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:39.240]
Black, you bad, teen red bird is black.

[00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:41.380]
Why does she, she, red bird is black.

[00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:43.480]
Nothing's got a feeling that black,

[00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:45.080]
another teen red bird is black.

[00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:47.920]
No one else can do the bad thing.

[00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:50.140]
Reach a still bit, it's not quite the same.

[00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:53.820]
TVK chose one, please, the same, another teen red bird is black.

[00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:56.960]
Those fearless stars are forever gone.

[00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:59.160]
Like Elaine Joyce and Joyce Ruofon,

[00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:00.780]
So we did you'll end baby,

[00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:02.540]
Noils done in no more than a flag.

[00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:05.420]
Richard Goss of the Patron Camel,

[00:31:05.820 --> 00:31:07.880]
And Brett Summers the Force Jack of Hunn.

[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.300]
We'll never know why God was up to some other teen red bird is black.

[00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:14.180]
There won't be any reunion at all.

[00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:16.320]
Charles doesn't mind the abit see the call.

[00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:18.520]
Don't be playing back date at all,

[00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:20.040]
Now the teen red bird is black.

[00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:23.420]
When we fight the bells will be in the hotpot.

[00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:25.460]
She's tied up being wins or not.

[00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:27.880]
He's the last guy to wear garter socks on now,

[00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:28.900]
She never flank.

[00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:31.640]
Until the babies will break and send tank.

[00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:33.740]
From that game we had teen to back.

[00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:35.960]
But now we can't cause teen is now black.

[00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:37.480]
Teen red bird is black.

[00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:40.120]
In the stop it, be wearable.

[00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:42.520]
I'm tired on the hair, don't give life to light.

[00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:44.660]
And on this human sense I leave the blank.

[00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:46.260]
Everyone else can go to black.

[00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:48.400]
Teen red bird is black.

[00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:50.600]
Teen red bird is black.

[00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:51.440]
He's still dead.

[00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:53.580]
And he still got to build bottom pants on

[00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:55.840]
and a mutton shop sideburns and whatever else.

[00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:57.880]
You always get a big kick when I say mutton shop sideburns.

[00:31:57.920 --> 00:31:58.820]
But that's what they call them.

[00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:01.940]
Back in the 70s, mutton shop sideburns.

[00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:03.480]
That was very in and long hair.

[00:32:03.620 --> 00:32:05.560]
Which I also had him and Jean Rayburn did not.

[00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:09.300]
Jean Rayburn did have at one time.

[00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:10.320]
He did have mutton shops.

[00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:11.460]
I don't care what you say.

[00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:13.180]
Ask chickener, he'll tell you.

[00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:13.880]
He did.

[00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:16.000]
Once upon a time in America, he did what?

[00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:17.560]
He totally did not let me lose it.

[00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:21.500]
Okay, here's George.

[00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:24.160]
You just want to watch it, mister.

[00:32:25.060 --> 00:32:26.560]
Nine hundred twelve votes on the pool.

[00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:29.280]
I don't know if I like this pool or not.

[00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:30.200]
Let's see, how many would I pay?

[00:32:30.340 --> 00:32:32.080]
I hate this pool.

[00:32:32.180 --> 00:32:32.880]
I would agree.

[00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:36.080]
Although I do like the one I think I might use this one for tomorrow.

[00:32:36.260 --> 00:32:38.000]
Oh, and you know what you forgot to remind me of?

[00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:38.760]
What?

[00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:40.000]
But it isn't my pile here.

[00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:40.980]
I just found it by accident.

[00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:45.220]
The BSO deputies will conduct a traffic checkpoint operation tonight.

[00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:46.180]
Nine to midnight.

[00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:47.740]
Stay away from a lot of their lakes.

[00:32:47.860 --> 00:32:49.380]
Not just died anytime if you're smart.

[00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:52.900]
Nine to midnight in the 3900 block of North West 21st Street

[00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:53.560]
and Notre-Dale lakes.

[00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:54.800]
There'll be a checkpoint, baby.

[00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:56.520]
They're going to be checking whose daughter you're nice.

[00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:58.020]
They're going to be doing body cavity searches.

[00:32:58.120 --> 00:32:58.980]
Everything under the sun.

[00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:02.760]
They're going to be looking inside, outside, up on top, down below.

[00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:05.200]
Vehicles will be inspected for defective safety.

[00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:07.100]
Equipment of motor will be asked to show it, baby.

[00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:10.860]
Show their driver's license, registration, and proof of insurance, man.

[00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:13.560]
Information is publishing compliance to the Supreme Court.

[00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:14.280]
But everybody will write.

[00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:15.300]
They don't want to tell you that.

[00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:18.160]
In other words, but the Supreme Court said you better fast up and tell them

[00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:19.840]
that they're going to be shaking your ass down.

[00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:21.000]
Nine to midnight tonight.

[00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:24.700]
In the 3900 block of North West 21st Street, Notre-Dale lakes.

[00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:26.700]
So if you're plastered, you're probably not a really good idea

[00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:28.400]
to be driving through that hood at that hour.

[00:33:29.740 --> 00:33:30.760]
Nine seventeen in the pool.

[00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:32.140]
A picture of Chris is charting this down.

[00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:34.180]
We're going to get, not going to get 1500 again today.

[00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:37.340]
That was, you know, maybe a once in a lifetime kind of a thing.

[00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:38.800]
Maybe someday we could do that again.

[00:33:38.860 --> 00:33:39.820]
You know, if we ever had a good pool,

[00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:41.160]
that everybody would want to vote on.

[00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:42.940]
Do us.

[00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:43.640]
What?

[00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:44.520]
What?

[00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:46.260]
I don't know what that would be.

[00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:48.060]
If I knew what it would be, I'd put it on there, you know.

[00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:52.480]
A Senate Republican is calling for Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez-Dismissal

[00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:55.160]
as Democrats' way subpoenaing President Bush's top aides

[00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:58.180]
in the escalating political fear over the firing of eight federal prosecutors,

[00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:00.240]
Senator John Sonuno of New Hampshire.

[00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:03.780]
A long time Bush administration critic facing a tough re-election campaign,

[00:34:04.180 --> 00:34:07.660]
called for Gonzalez's out to yesterday just hours after Bush expressed confidence

[00:34:07.660 --> 00:34:10.700]
in the anxious, mid-Jick Attorney General's a long time friend.

[00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:13.640]
I think the president should replace him, Sonuno, and say,

[00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:16.180]
and then in a view, I think the Attorney General should be fired at it.

[00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:17.720]
Let's get Donald Chomping area.

[00:34:17.780 --> 00:34:18.760]
You're fired at it, man.

[00:34:19.220 --> 00:34:19.960]
You little mid-Jick?

[00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:24.440]
Although some Republicans have been tepid in their support for the Attorney General tepid,

[00:34:25.060 --> 00:34:25.800]
lukewarm, baby.

[00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:28.380]
In fact, that's what we used to ask on flipper every week.

[00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:29.040]
Is lukewarm?

[00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:29.520]
Hmm.

[00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:34.120]
Sonuno was the first to go so far in a wake of an upper-over-the-distant department's firing of the attorneys,

[00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:37.320]
and his response to congressional questions plus a separate report

[00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:41.000]
that the administration abused his power to secretly investigate suspected terrorists.

[00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:44.240]
The White House issued a court response to Sonuno's remarks.

[00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:45.480]
Remember, court, he was the one that said,

[00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:46.300]
Damn God!

[00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:49.700]
We're disappointed, obviously, about House folks in Mintoni Snow said,

[00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:51.680]
a Justice Department spokeswoman refused to comment.

[00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:53.440]
But a beep put a boop put a bob.

[00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:53.860]
Oh, no.

[00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:56.880]
Although Bush left himself room to sack the Attorney General,

[00:34:57.260 --> 00:35:00.380]
speaking of that sack, remember that thing we had yesterday about the long nut sack,

[00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:00.980]
whatever that was?

[00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:03.220]
Yeah, yeah, the stain was that big, fraudulent guy.

[00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:03.720]

[00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:04.360]
Big canes, buddy.

[00:35:04.660 --> 00:35:05.720]
We wanted to give you a bigger bag.

[00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:08.640]
Oh, yeah.

[00:35:09.100 --> 00:35:10.460]
What a sack of crap that is.

[00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:12.780]
Speaking of Mr. Ego and that Make Believe Show,

[00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:15.260]
and Make Believe Station, everybody's got to make a living though, you know.

[00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:18.260]
I was thinking when I was reading that, but I didn't want to editorialize,

[00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:21.300]
because it was just so overwhelmed by that, but not really wasn't shocked.

[00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:23.420]
I was thinking to myself,

[00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:24.780]
here's the guy that said, over the years,

[00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:27.640]
every body part, I don't think he's got like one eye,

[00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:29.980]
his eye, his ass, his unit, everything.

[00:35:30.260 --> 00:35:31.360]
Every part of him is like fake,

[00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:32.920]
with all these people he puts on here.

[00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:35.620]
Well, here's the, you know, doctor, this one and that one,

[00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:37.300]
and they're going to put a new ear on your lower,

[00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:39.800]
they're going to stick on those where your left ear used to be, you know.

[00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:43.260]
So he's got all these phony body parts.

[00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:45.740]
I never left more power to him on a station that nobody can,

[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.360]
even if they wanted to listen, they had no idea where it isn't,

[00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:50.040]
if they knew where it was, they still couldn't pick it up.

[00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:50.580]
How do you like that?

[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:52.880]
Oh, look at that first Mormon president, Mitt Romney.

[00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:54.380]
The answer is no, he'll be on with Larry tonight.

[00:35:54.380 --> 00:35:56.800]
Another good reason not to watch the suspended one.

[00:35:57.340 --> 00:35:58.960]
It's in the bag on Larry King's show,

[00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:00.280]
and the guests can all smell it.

[00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:03.040]
So he's got Mitt Romney on there.

[00:36:03.460 --> 00:36:05.080]
See, it's not so much that he's a Mormon,

[00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:07.200]
it's the fact that he's phony, he's full of crap.

[00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:10.340]
He changes his position depending on which way to win his blowing,

[00:36:10.340 --> 00:36:12.020]
like John McCain, kind of that deal, you know.

[00:36:12.940 --> 00:36:15.540]
And all this excitement that the Republicans have about Rudy Giuliani

[00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:18.480]
because of all his posturing on 9-11 and so on,

[00:36:18.700 --> 00:36:21.560]
when the stuff hits the fan about his 85 divorces and all that,

[00:36:21.740 --> 00:36:23.620]
him and Rudy Gingrich, man, same deal.

[00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:27.380]
All these flandering right-wingers,

[00:36:27.460 --> 00:36:29.480]
they're always pointing the finger at all you perverted liberals,

[00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:32.840]
all you secular humanists perverts who are doing everything that moves,

[00:36:33.340 --> 00:36:34.560]
and doing all these disgusting things.

[00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:37.560]
In the meantime, they got like 85 wives and 25 girlfriends,

[00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:40.200]
and his buddy Bernie Kerak is up there banging his brains out

[00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:42.080]
in that thing that was supposed to be the big bunker

[00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:43.280]
across from the World Trade Center.

[00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:44.720]
Even artsy wouldn't go there.

[00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:47.020]
928 votes on the pool.

[00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:48.560]
Embarrassingly, I don't know,

[00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:50.540]
and then of course I know all the answers to these,

[00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:54.540]
a 667, 72%, so they're not embarrassed because they know it all.

[00:36:55.700 --> 00:36:57.380]
Or I like this Bob McCollum guy, he's fun.

[00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:03.800]
He's got a thing 27 Yankees to play with Babe Ruth.

[00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:06.740]
More recently in basketball, Michael Jordan,

[00:37:06.860 --> 00:37:08.660]
and the bulls of the 1990s.

[00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:10.580]
Yeah, but probably the number one choice

[00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:13.800]
would be the late 50s, early 60s.

[00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:16.460]
Sammy Dominguez, a full stadium in Cleveland, Ohio.

[00:37:16.460 --> 00:37:18.720]
Let me suit up with Jim Brown, the greatest running back.

[00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:19.740]
Oh, yeah, let me suit up there.

[00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:22.240]
In other words, let me get naked and take a shower with all these jocks.

[00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:24.240]
That's what Bob McCollum is saying on the fan in Toronto.

[00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:26.900]
You see, that's just a south Florida thing.

[00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:29.800]
It's a worldwide thing. It's the sports nerd mentality.

[00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:32.480]
I hate this pool 96%, 10%.

[00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:34.500]
The words to the star's bagel batter don't know them.

[00:37:34.780 --> 00:37:35.020]
60.

[00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:37.080]
The answer is to several of these 53.

[00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:37.780]
Uh-oh.

[00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:39.740]
Where Iraq is on a map 18.

[00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:41.280]
See, that's not moving because they don't want to admit it.

[00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:42.400]
That's how embarrassing that is.

[00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:45.040]
In fact, if we asked where Florida was on the map,

[00:37:45.140 --> 00:37:47.320]
there's about half the audience couldn't find it with all three hands.

[00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:49.500]
The answer is 20 of these nine,

[00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:50.720]
a pledge of allegiance in seven,

[00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:52.600]
who are nation's capital as name four six.

[00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:53.520]
Isn't it Mary Tyler Moore?

[00:37:54.340 --> 00:37:54.580]
Yeah.

[00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:57.320]
What size fought in the Civil War three?

[00:37:58.040 --> 00:37:59.160]
Wasn't it the East and West?

[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:00.220]
Sure.

[00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:02.400]
What year America declared its independence three?

[00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:04.100]
How many stars are on the flag two?

[00:38:04.260 --> 00:38:05.640]
How many states there are in the union two?

[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:07.320]
And who was president before W?

[00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:09.140]
You may not remember,

[00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:10.900]
but boy, boy, we sure wish we had a backup.

[00:38:11.060 --> 00:38:11.520]
Tell you that.

[00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:15.000]
See, with his very important faxes,

[00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:15.880]
oh, another pool.

[00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:19.160]
If first decides to cancel the 2008 presidential election,

[00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:20.300]
who will be the other stop him?

[00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:23.100]
Oh, Tom, let me put that way down here.

[00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:25.280]
A back of the stack.

[00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:27.260]
Yeah, back in the bottom of my stack.

[00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:28.220]
We got all of it.

[00:38:28.220 --> 00:38:30.360]
I like the one for tomorrow, though, about the dumb expressions.

[00:38:30.820 --> 00:38:32.060]
I mean, I don't know if it is for tomorrow,

[00:38:32.060 --> 00:38:32.980]
but I'll decide.

[00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:35.060]
You know, I'll make my judgment myself when I get around to it.

[00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:35.660]
I'm good and ready.

[00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:37.440]
You remember Berger, chef?

[00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:40.300]
See, I interrupted my couple like a half an hour ago.

[00:38:40.380 --> 00:38:41.100]
But I do that all the time.

[00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:43.840]
I do have a recollection of that.

[00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:45.180]
Now, Berger, chef,

[00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:47.560]
I think it was in 75.

[00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:48.620]
I remember that very well,

[00:38:48.660 --> 00:38:49.600]
because I was a WGN,

[00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:50.820]
an almost Palm Beach in 75,

[00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:51.780]
but I lost all that weight.

[00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:53.140]
What was I doing at Berger, chef,

[00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:53.980]
if I lost all that weight?

[00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:56.420]
I was finding it again.

[00:38:56.580 --> 00:38:56.900]
You lose it.

[00:38:56.900 --> 00:38:58.120]
You go looking for it and you find it.

[00:38:58.160 --> 00:38:58.420]
And I did.

[00:38:58.840 --> 00:38:59.580]
That's really sad.

[00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:01.360]
Although I'm not that, you know,

[00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:02.720]
I'm still in a very low 180s.

[00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:06.660]
I just can't make the transition yet in the 170s.

[00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:07.660]
I got plenty of time, you know?

[00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:10.400]
In fact, if I'm next vacation,

[00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:12.080]
if I should be an Amsterdam of all places,

[00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:13.380]
I think that will help a lot.

[00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:18.680]
Because you don't be in a lot of great cuisine at Amsterdam.

[00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:20.020]
Let me just warn you that right now.

[00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:21.980]
It's a fun place when there's a lot of tourists there.

[00:39:22.260 --> 00:39:23.420]
When only the Dutch people are there,

[00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:24.260]
like in a winter time,

[00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:25.440]
and when the weather is crappy,

[00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:26.660]
which is part of the time a lot,

[00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:27.780]
you don't want to be there.

[00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:28.540]
Believe you me.

[00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:29.700]
Because the Dutch people,

[00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:30.660]
generally speaking,

[00:39:30.860 --> 00:39:32.920]
are mostly disgusting and grotesque.

[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:33.900]
But beside that,

[00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:36.300]
but when the Amsterdam,

[00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:38.140]
because it attracts so many zillions of tourists

[00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:39.220]
from all over the world,

[00:39:39.220 --> 00:39:40.300]
especially all over Europe,

[00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:42.880]
that's when it's really interesting.

[00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:43.320]
And I mean,

[00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:46.360]
it's not the food.

[00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:47.640]
The food is never interesting.

[00:39:48.940 --> 00:39:50.360]
Tell us the expression that people say,

[00:39:50.420 --> 00:39:51.000]
a pig in a poke,

[00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:52.540]
or I already read these yesterday,

[00:39:52.700 --> 00:39:53.920]
well, we'll come up with some other ones.

[00:39:54.620 --> 00:39:55.960]
In fact, we were mentioning someone

[00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:56.800]
that should have written them on here.

[00:39:56.880 --> 00:39:58.060]
Well, I'll put a lot of work in on that.

[00:39:58.180 --> 00:39:58.840]
I'll spend at least what?

[00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:00.180]
10, 20 seconds on that.

[00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:00.820]
It made me even.

[00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:01.740]
About 30, man.

[00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:02.560]
30 seconds on.

[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:05.020]
We're public and lawmakers

[00:40:05.020 --> 00:40:06.700]
who went for an hour to listen to an expert play

[00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:08.680]
down the promises of embryonic stem cell research

[00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:10.640]
did not let the public know they were meeting

[00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:11.820]
even though the Florida legislature

[00:40:11.820 --> 00:40:13.240]
is considering two bills on the issue.

[00:40:14.660 --> 00:40:16.480]
This is in the Harold Gary Fine Out.

[00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:20.780]
I wonder if he's keen to Gary tune out.

[00:40:21.020 --> 00:40:22.040]
Oh, we got a lot of those on here.

[00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:23.500]
I wonder how Drew Rosinhouse team is doing.

[00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:26.980]
As many as 25 House Republicans gather

[00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:28.820]
at the University Club at FSU on London

[00:40:28.820 --> 00:40:30.560]
and I take a lecture by Marine Condick,

[00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:33.040]
a neurobiologist and professor at the University

[00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:34.000]
of Utah School of Medicine.

[00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:35.940]
The dinner and conducts expenses were paid

[00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:37.220]
by the Republican Party of Florida.

[00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:40.280]
The lecture comes at the same time that legislators

[00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:41.840]
are considering two bills to set aside

[00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:43.900]
20 million dollars for stem cell research.

[00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:45.500]
The main difference between the measures,

[00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:47.360]
the version backed by Democrats authorizes

[00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:49.120]
spending money on embryonic stem cell research,

[00:40:49.460 --> 00:40:51.220]
which results in the destruction of human embryos

[00:40:51.220 --> 00:40:52.700]
while the Republican version does not.

[00:40:52.980 --> 00:40:54.440]
And by the way, speaking about McComb before,

[00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:55.600]
I would have much rather had a shower

[00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:56.740]
with Dale Murphy of anybody.

[00:40:57.180 --> 00:40:59.220]
Oh, Republican leaders said the meeting

[00:40:59.220 --> 00:41:00.840]
which was first disclosed by the Palm Beach

[00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:03.140]
posted on violate any public meeting laws.

[00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:05.420]
There was no secret meetings that represented

[00:41:05.420 --> 00:41:07.520]
Ellen Boggenoff, a four-law of the Republican,

[00:41:07.940 --> 00:41:08.640]
one of those who attended.

[00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:11.440]
It was a lecture to provide people with valuable information.

[00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:13.620]
Representative Franklin Sands,

[00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:15.600]
the Western Democrats sponsoring embryonic stem cell

[00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:16.980]
legislation, said he was disappointed.

[00:41:17.220 --> 00:41:18.880]
He wasn't invited or even told about the meeting.

[00:41:19.660 --> 00:41:21.380]
I would like the issue debated in the sunshine,

[00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:23.200]
Sands, said, call an expert,

[00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:25.100]
thus us into both sides of the issues and be fair.

[00:41:25.340 --> 00:41:28.260]
I wanted that ever start, especially with right wing lunatics.

[00:41:28.460 --> 00:41:29.240]
You're killing life!

[00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:30.140]
You're killing life!

[00:41:30.380 --> 00:41:31.740]
Yeah, all these people are dying in Iraq.

[00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:32.760]
We're not killing life over there.

[00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:33.720]
Thank the Lord for that.

[00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:34.200]
Thank God!

[00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:35.660]
They deserve it.

[00:41:35.740 --> 00:41:36.100]
They shouldn't have decided.

[00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:37.680]
Just like their general Peter Pace,

[00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:40.220]
who gives me the trots when he came right down to it.

[00:41:41.140 --> 00:41:42.180]
Representative Antiri Flores,

[00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:43.720]
a West Kendall Republican sponsoring bill

[00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:45.360]
that sets aside money for stem cell research

[00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:46.860]
that doesn't involve embryos,

[00:41:46.860 --> 00:41:49.080]
said she had nothing to do with the organizing of Monday Night Meeting.

[00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:51.400]
She said the meeting was the idea of the state to UOP,

[00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:53.300]
which she said promised members earlier in the year

[00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:55.340]
that it would host presentations at the top of its interest.

[00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:57.440]
So party members could make more informed decisions on the issues

[00:41:57.440 --> 00:41:59.720]
and continue being in the Neanderthal age,

[00:41:59.780 --> 00:42:01.200]
like the pissed off caveman.

[00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:03.420]
He can probably relate to the provolican parties,

[00:42:03.540 --> 00:42:04.900]
as that's where most of them are coming from.

[00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:07.320]
Neanderthal age,

[00:42:07.420 --> 00:42:10.080]
let's take 400 giant steps backward.

[00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:10.920]
That's what we've been doing.

[00:42:11.340 --> 00:42:12.820]
And let's say, well, we're at a kilo bunch of people,

[00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:13.460]
like Mo with said.

[00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:15.460]
It's not really worth finding that thing on area.

[00:42:15.460 --> 00:42:16.500]
Kill some people.

[00:42:17.340 --> 00:42:19.380]
That's what the Bush administration does better than anything else.

[00:42:19.580 --> 00:42:20.480]
Kill a whole bunch of people.

[00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:21.160]
That's right.

[00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:22.360]
Blood on her hands.

[00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:24.140]
Blood just gushing, pouring.

[00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:27.520]
It's like somebody opened up a gigantic faucet in a bathtub.

[00:42:27.900 --> 00:42:30.080]
And it's just pouring blood, like what movie was that in?

[00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:32.520]
Wasn't that in here?

[00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:34.620]
Yeah, I was just going to say here is Johnny.

[00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:35.460]
I was just going to say that.

[00:42:35.580 --> 00:42:36.460]
That's the one, isn't it?

[00:42:36.900 --> 00:42:38.780]
What the elevator door is opening up and all the blood in there.

[00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:41.040]
Yeah, all the blood down the hallway in that old hotel.

[00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:42.120]
Oh my god.

[00:42:42.380 --> 00:42:43.360]
That movie was terrible.

[00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:45.440]
I mean, it had potential.

[00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:46.840]
It had potential.

[00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:47.020]
It had potential.

[00:42:47.020 --> 00:42:50.140]
It had parts that, you know, some good parts, but as a whole, yeah.

[00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:51.580]
It was grotesque.

[00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:52.900]
Here is Johnny.

[00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:55.660]
That was just about the only good thing he did in the movie.

[00:42:56.300 --> 00:42:58.220]
He sat there and he kept typing, but it would be better

[00:42:58.220 --> 00:43:00.360]
if I'm tapping and typing and typing and tapping.

[00:43:00.540 --> 00:43:01.020]
But you know.

[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:04.960]
It was pretty weak.

[00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:08.280]
10.56 at 5.60 Q.I.M.

[00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:08.860]
The system is going.

[00:43:09.540 --> 00:43:09.800]
No, no, no, no.

[00:43:10.220 --> 00:43:11.080]
It's got confirmation.

[00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:12.360]
This is the blame.

[00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:15.340]
Any questions?

[00:43:17.180 --> 00:43:19.220]
All the world loves a cloud.

[00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:23.520]
So this April Fool's Day, this radio stage, it is going to make a fool out of you.

[00:43:23.660 --> 00:43:24.120]
That's right.

[00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:26.940]
We're going to turn you into a laughing star.

[00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:29.060]
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

[00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:31.200]
Just be the tenth caller when you hear this star.

[00:43:31.860 --> 00:43:34.160]
And we'll yant your pants down around your ankles.

[00:43:34.460 --> 00:43:35.740]
Tie your hands behind your head.

[00:43:35.980 --> 00:43:39.440]
Fade a smiley face on your butt cheeks and lock you out of your house.

[00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:41.480]
You'll be the center of attention in no time.

[00:43:41.620 --> 00:43:43.860]
Remember, they're not laughing at you.

[00:43:44.180 --> 00:43:45.660]
They're laughing with you.

[00:43:45.820 --> 00:43:47.140]
With you and your butt cheeks.

[00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:52.460]
Employees of this radio station are not eligible to be made fools of,

[00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:56.120]
since they've already done quite a good job making fools of themselves every day on the air.

[00:43:56.600 --> 00:44:01.140]
Employees who never have a less wish to drop the pants in public are encouraged to do so after leaving the station property.

[00:44:01.260 --> 00:44:02.960]
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

[00:44:03.100 --> 00:44:04.200]
Be an April Fool.

[00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:05.980]
People are saying for your chance to win.

[00:44:05.980 --> 00:44:08.060]
It's 11.02 at 5.60 W.D.QM.

[00:44:08.180 --> 00:44:08.980]
It's the eyes of March.

[00:44:09.060 --> 00:44:13.640]
We're only a couple weeks away from Easter and pace off and all these good things and the April Fool's Day.

[00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:17.260]
That to me is one of the most pathetic things that people do.

[00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:20.600]
They go on here and they make up some stupid crap and then they get to know each other.

[00:44:21.100 --> 00:44:21.420]
Oh, yeah.

[00:44:21.420 --> 00:44:21.920]
Oh, yeah.

[00:44:22.180 --> 00:44:23.300]
Great wording you used to do that.

[00:44:23.380 --> 00:44:23.800]
I told you that.

[00:44:24.020 --> 00:44:27.480]
So how much you want to bet that we have people on this radio station that will be doing that?

[00:44:27.580 --> 00:44:28.860]
Although it's a Sunday show.

[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:29.760]
You're not the United Republic.

[00:44:29.820 --> 00:44:30.080]
Wait a minute.

[00:44:30.220 --> 00:44:32.040]
Are you that guy's going to call back into what do you say?

[00:44:32.180 --> 00:44:33.180]
I should be ashamed of myself.

[00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:35.920]
Why would you imply that I was talking about the leading show?

[00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:36.320]
I'm not going to do myself.

[00:44:36.460 --> 00:44:37.400]
I get my honest opinion.

[00:44:37.660 --> 00:44:46.200]
The fact of the matter is that when we got guys in there promoting some stupid basketball game between Gonzaga and University of Rochester School for Blind Women, what's all a Zat?

[00:44:47.540 --> 00:44:48.760]
That's not exactly what I can say.

[00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:51.860]
Well, of course it is what I expect because that's the kind of lead that they're giving us anyway.

[00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:54.140]
Actually, I take that back since it's on a Sunday.

[00:44:54.300 --> 00:44:54.920]
This year, isn't it?

[00:44:55.260 --> 00:44:55.800]
April Fool's Day?

[00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:56.760]
No, it is not.

[00:44:57.080 --> 00:44:57.500]
Yes, it is.

[00:44:58.320 --> 00:44:58.480]
So, yeah.

[00:44:58.600 --> 00:44:59.980]
It's a week before Easter Sunday.

[00:45:00.340 --> 00:45:01.520]
April Fool's Day is on Sunday.

[00:45:01.740 --> 00:45:03.320]
The Friday show is on the Eve.

[00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:06.440]
960 votes on the pool.

[00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:07.180]
This is the hour.

[00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:09.360]
In fact, maybe even this half hour, we go over 1,000.

[00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:16.580]
Then Chris can sit back in a chair and slump over like, you know, pick up the oxygen tube or breathe in easy.

[00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:17.340]
Well, it's good news.

[00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:18.980]
And the fire alarm is over here.

[00:45:19.160 --> 00:45:20.540]
Finally, I was able to open up the door.

[00:45:20.860 --> 00:45:23.400]
When I closed the door on a day like this, I don't know what the temperature is.

[00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:25.860]
It's nothing like the last two days when we were approaching 60 here.

[00:45:26.460 --> 00:45:27.500]
A little preview of...

[00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:29.720]
But it looks kind of like murky and not too bad out there.

[00:45:29.860 --> 00:45:30.240]
It's a...

[00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:31.340]
Oh, yeah. It's in a plus column.

[00:45:31.340 --> 00:45:32.620]
Maybe it's plus one.

[00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:35.260]
As Jo Angel would say, put it in the plus column.

[00:45:36.460 --> 00:45:36.780]
34.

[00:45:37.140 --> 00:45:37.700]
And going to be three.

[00:45:37.820 --> 00:45:38.920]
All the way up to almost 40 today.

[00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:39.640]
All right.

[00:45:39.980 --> 00:45:42.060]
I mean, it's, you know, whatever it is.

[00:45:42.980 --> 00:45:44.400]
Whatever the weather is you get used to it.

[00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:44.760]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:45.840]
This business about the weather.

[00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:48.420]
All these people have moved to Florida because of the weather.

[00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:53.320]
And they forget about the fact that from the first of May until the end of October, until at least the end of October.

[00:45:53.940 --> 00:45:55.140]
It's 100 degrees in the shade.

[00:45:55.180 --> 00:45:56.780]
The humidity is 400%.

[00:45:56.780 --> 00:46:01.160]
And even if you stand under a palm tree somewhere where you find a little bit of finesse debris,

[00:46:01.700 --> 00:46:03.280]
your armpits are just...

[00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:05.200]
The sweat is pouring from your pits.

[00:46:05.540 --> 00:46:12.000]
You feel like Zazu pits or Elijah pits or Frank pits or Brad pits or Brad's pit.

[00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:16.180]
965.

[00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:17.840]
So what about a burger chef?

[00:46:18.660 --> 00:46:20.300]
And I'm sure I'm not the only one who remembers these.

[00:46:20.700 --> 00:46:22.920]
And you're going to say, oh, there he goes again living in the past.

[00:46:23.460 --> 00:46:24.340]
I remember burger chef.

[00:46:24.340 --> 00:46:25.320]
Well, there you go.

[00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:27.460]
And they had what they called the Fixins Bar.

[00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:28.560]
Okay.

[00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:30.180]
Kind of like...

[00:46:30.180 --> 00:46:32.160]
Fog Rutgers is still in business on the right.

[00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:34.540]
And just sent me a message saying that one of them, I don't want to say which one.

[00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:36.620]
But one of them had like a thing under...

[00:46:36.620 --> 00:46:37.500]
I don't even know.

[00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:40.680]
I'm not that I don't trust him or take his word, but I don't want to say it on the year.

[00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:43.220]
Maybe a little problem with the health department possibly.

[00:46:43.460 --> 00:46:44.160]
I don't know.

[00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:45.800]
That's just a rumor flowing around.

[00:46:45.880 --> 00:46:46.840]
Hey, it's just extra protein.

[00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:52.440]
And the thing with Fog Rutgers is that there's one right there, not far away from where I've been living for the last many, many Zidian years.

[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:53.420]
Some right.

[00:46:53.420 --> 00:46:53.840]
Some right.

[00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:54.380]
Some right.

[00:46:54.460 --> 00:46:54.460]

[00:46:54.500 --> 00:46:54.840]
The university.

[00:46:54.980 --> 00:46:55.360]
Very good.

[00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:57.320]
And you know what used to be next door to it?

[00:46:57.380 --> 00:46:58.260]
I'm not sure if it's still there.

[00:46:58.300 --> 00:46:59.360]
It was in Arbys.

[00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:00.840]
Okay.

[00:47:01.180 --> 00:47:04.000]
Every two years Arbys comes out with something really, really good.

[00:47:04.060 --> 00:47:05.100]
And then you try it a few times.

[00:47:05.100 --> 00:47:07.380]
He's like, oh man, I was going to then they discontinue right away.

[00:47:07.460 --> 00:47:07.460]

[00:47:07.460 --> 00:47:08.720]
For a limited time only, here's something good.

[00:47:08.720 --> 00:47:08.880]
That's right.

[00:47:09.180 --> 00:47:09.400]
You know?

[00:47:10.660 --> 00:47:11.880]
Wendy's is famous for doing that too.

[00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:13.260]
Although I do like Wendy's all the time.

[00:47:13.320 --> 00:47:14.880]
They've always got general good stuff.

[00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:20.360]
But once in a while they come out with something like the Shroom, the Cheddar, Bacon, what...

[00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:23.700]
Salads though at Wendy's like their taco salad or anything like that.

[00:47:24.980 --> 00:47:25.660]
You do what?

[00:47:26.020 --> 00:47:27.600]
I said don't have any of their...

[00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:27.840]
Really?

[00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:29.280]
Yeah.

[00:47:30.060 --> 00:47:30.560]
Why is that?

[00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:33.940]
For example, their taco salad is just a salad.

[00:47:34.180 --> 00:47:35.440]
We're the bowl full of greens.

[00:47:35.980 --> 00:47:37.220]
And then they give you a bowl of chili.

[00:47:37.660 --> 00:47:38.000]
They're chili.

[00:47:38.300 --> 00:47:40.700]
And you're supposed to pour the chili on the salad and it's all watery.

[00:47:40.900 --> 00:47:41.840]
And it's soupy and it's like that.

[00:47:41.840 --> 00:47:42.080]
Yeah.

[00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:43.580]
So much fat.

[00:47:43.720 --> 00:47:45.980]
Why are we going to get some fast food for Jews for Christ's sake?

[00:47:46.080 --> 00:47:47.480]
Sounds like all the fast food is for Glam.

[00:47:47.740 --> 00:47:49.040]
So anyway, getting back to the Fun Rockers.

[00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:49.840]
There's the thing that...

[00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:51.200]
I like Fun Rockers.

[00:47:51.500 --> 00:47:52.500]
You know, it's the same thing.

[00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:53.580]
The idea of building your own burger.

[00:47:53.780 --> 00:47:55.080]
Or to your hamburger or cheeseburger.

[00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:55.520]
You know what?

[00:47:55.920 --> 00:47:58.600]
The only problem is you have to remember to tell them, don't butter the bun.

[00:47:58.720 --> 00:47:59.220]
Hold the butter.

[00:47:59.640 --> 00:47:59.900]
They butter.

[00:48:00.380 --> 00:48:01.160]
No, listen to me.

[00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:02.380]
You know I have this sensitive stomach.

[00:48:02.380 --> 00:48:04.060]
I got the irritable ABS thing going.

[00:48:04.900 --> 00:48:06.780]
And every time I would eat there, I would have to...

[00:48:06.780 --> 00:48:08.040]
It's not that far from my house.

[00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:08.700]
You know where it is.

[00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:11.600]
I mean, maybe a four or five minute drive from there to get to my house.

[00:48:11.700 --> 00:48:13.500]
But Jesus, man, I have to...

[00:48:13.500 --> 00:48:14.520]
For that fat, maybe.

[00:48:14.840 --> 00:48:15.720]
I mean, eat it all the way there.

[00:48:16.100 --> 00:48:16.100]

[00:48:17.380 --> 00:48:18.320]
They butter the bun.

[00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:20.400]
Oh, just like that.

[00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:21.460]
What?

[00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:22.180]
I like that.

[00:48:22.340 --> 00:48:23.260]
Well, I don't like that.

[00:48:23.540 --> 00:48:25.760]
And the rumor I'm getting is that Chick-fil-A does the same thing.

[00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:29.600]
Now, I wanted to get started putting mayonnaise on there for your burger and your chicken sandwich stew.

[00:48:29.720 --> 00:48:31.020]
Talk about sure you can order that.

[00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:32.780]
You don't put mayonnaise.

[00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:34.360]
Let the dutch do that on their fries.

[00:48:34.580 --> 00:48:36.360]
Okay, ask John Revolta. He'll tell you a hundred times.

[00:48:36.700 --> 00:48:38.620]
Oh, the dutch they put mayonnaise on their french fries.

[00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:39.440]
Ah, ha, ha, ha.

[00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:40.980]
And that's what a great line is for a Volta.

[00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:41.380]
You idiot.

[00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:45.960]
But at any rate, you don't put mayonnaise on a sandwich.

[00:48:46.220 --> 00:48:47.200]
I'm just telling you that right now.

[00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:48.460]
Goyum can do that.

[00:48:48.820 --> 00:48:49.780]
Not real people.

[00:48:50.460 --> 00:48:51.440]
WQA and hello.

[00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:53.000]
Hey, Neil, how are you buddy?

[00:48:53.100 --> 00:48:53.680]
Okay, sir.

[00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:57.560]
Just not to be living in the past and get George upset.

[00:48:58.100 --> 00:48:58.780]
Don't get upset.

[00:48:59.320 --> 00:49:02.140]
As far as ice cream goes, your number's nips.

[00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:04.940]
Sure. That was a horrible place.

[00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:06.840]
It was a make-your-on-sunday place, right?

[00:49:06.920 --> 00:49:12.360]
Yeah, but everybody stuck their fingers in the sink, the sprinkles, the dirty.

[00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:14.220]
Oh, no, I don't remember that.

[00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:16.360]
So glad you brought that up though.

[00:49:17.860 --> 00:49:20.660]
Oh, what a fine reminder that is.

[00:49:20.900 --> 00:49:24.180]
ZIP dash, I mean pasta VZ, zips.

[00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:25.280]
Zips that I remember, too.

[00:49:25.860 --> 00:49:26.620]
And tasty freeze.

[00:49:27.560 --> 00:49:28.640]
Oh yeah, I remember tasty freeze.

[00:49:28.640 --> 00:49:30.860]
That was kind of like a rip-off on the old dairy queen.

[00:49:31.060 --> 00:49:31.740]
Remember the dairy queen?

[00:49:31.740 --> 00:49:32.240]
They're still a little.

[00:49:32.340 --> 00:49:32.920]
Oh, that.

[00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:35.660]
I got those B.K. brothers sandwiches or whatever they call.

[00:49:35.780 --> 00:49:38.040]
I don't know what they got, but oh, don't do those.

[00:49:38.540 --> 00:49:43.360]
But anyway, zips, zips was like similar to what we're talking about with the burger chef and

[00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:47.620]
the burger truckers where you would go in and you'd make your own sunday.

[00:49:47.920 --> 00:49:50.580]
And they had, you know, like your, like Carvella ice cream, what do you want?

[00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:52.480]
It's like soft ice cream, not not real ice cream.

[00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:53.180]
What do they call that?

[00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:54.100]
Soft.

[00:49:54.500 --> 00:49:54.760]
Yeah.

[00:49:56.200 --> 00:50:00.900]
And it was, the ice cream was not good, but then you could drown it with like, you know, hot fudge or butter

[00:50:00.900 --> 00:50:03.280]
scotch or caramel or some people say caramel.

[00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:06.220]
I have no idea why people say caramel and they know the hell out of me.

[00:50:06.260 --> 00:50:09.380]
You know, it's one thing if you say tomato when I say tomato or potato and potato.

[00:50:09.860 --> 00:50:10.360]
But caramel?

[00:50:10.660 --> 00:50:11.940]
Do you laugh at those people?

[00:50:11.940 --> 00:50:14.420]
I really laugh hardly at those people, eh?

[00:50:15.360 --> 00:50:16.280]
Yeah, like that.

[00:50:16.360 --> 00:50:17.480]
That's right, a big belly laugh.

[00:50:17.540 --> 00:50:19.480]
Like I was last year, I was warning show all the time.

[00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:23.420]
I'm going to tell you, if you missed the Kenny and Bull morning show, man, you are missing a laugh while, then.

[00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:25.920]
It is absolutely different.

[00:50:29.460 --> 00:50:30.840]
A lot of laughing while I'm in.

[00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:32.240]
A lot of belly laughing?

[00:50:32.520 --> 00:50:33.040]
Oh, yeah.

[00:50:35.340 --> 00:50:38.000]
I was a bad one burger, and she still laughing at it.

[00:50:39.560 --> 00:50:40.920]
That a hair across the street.

[00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:43.700]
She was like the polka chaffer, Waxie Buddha, from that I heard.

[00:50:45.220 --> 00:50:46.400]
She knew everything, man.

[00:50:46.500 --> 00:50:47.480]
She knew the whole bowl of wax.

[00:50:48.680 --> 00:50:52.040]
973, wherever the House of Waxing 3D, the original one with Vincent Price.

[00:50:52.280 --> 00:50:53.600]
They made, they, we made that one too.

[00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:57.940]
Too many, we made movies of ones that were classed if they should just have released the original.

[00:50:58.020 --> 00:50:59.580]
But then again, they can't make any money off of that.

[00:50:59.960 --> 00:51:00.600]
QA& Hello.

[00:51:01.720 --> 00:51:04.300]
It's, but, Dr. Chris is no longer there.

[00:51:04.560 --> 00:51:04.860]
Sir.

[00:51:05.460 --> 00:51:05.820]
Really?

[00:51:07.020 --> 00:51:07.380]
Absolutely.

[00:51:07.840 --> 00:51:09.160]
You're, I know your burger place is Mr.

[00:51:09.460 --> 00:51:10.020]
Could you show it to me?

[00:51:10.060 --> 00:51:12.020]
I'm the one on Sunrise University is no longer there.

[00:51:13.500 --> 00:51:14.800]
Absolutely correct, sir.

[00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:19.660]
Okay, maybe the bridge center right there, once in a year.

[00:51:21.980 --> 00:51:23.340]
I'm sure it's still there.

[00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:24.440]
I, I seen it, man.

[00:51:24.540 --> 00:51:25.660]
I've seen it with all three eyes.

[00:51:25.800 --> 00:51:26.800]
I haven't been there in a long time.

[00:51:27.060 --> 00:51:29.320]
Well, I have been, because that's where my house is, man.

[00:51:29.360 --> 00:51:30.800]
It was just there a couple of weeks ago.

[00:51:31.620 --> 00:51:34.120]
I'm sure that Fudruckers didn't just vanish into thin air.

[00:51:34.120 --> 00:51:35.460]
You know the rest of the time.

[00:51:35.460 --> 00:51:37.040]
I don't have any idea what it is now.

[00:51:37.260 --> 00:51:39.440]
It's changed about 600 times because it's too damn big.

[00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:45.840]
Across from the Broward Mall on the corner of university and, what is that?

[00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:53.620]
University and, and something.

[00:51:54.360 --> 00:51:55.360]
What was the rest of it?

[00:51:55.380 --> 00:51:55.380]

[00:51:55.700 --> 00:51:55.780]
Huh?

[00:51:56.140 --> 00:51:56.840]
University and what?

[00:51:57.120 --> 00:51:58.000]
What, what, what, what, what, what, what, uh, restaurant?

[00:51:58.100 --> 00:52:00.420]
Well, you know, across from the Broward Mall on the corner there.

[00:52:01.740 --> 00:52:02.560]
I think it's Broward.

[00:52:02.560 --> 00:52:03.180]
I think it's Broward.

[00:52:03.300 --> 00:52:05.160]
It was a Chinese restaurant and Broward Boulevard.

[00:52:05.300 --> 00:52:06.760]
That's what I'm, that's what they call the Broward Mall.

[00:52:07.020 --> 00:52:08.020]
Give me a little help, okay?

[00:52:08.080 --> 00:52:09.140]
I'm out of touch for Christ's sake.

[00:52:09.140 --> 00:52:12.320]
You're the one that's supposed to be the expert, Mr. Hollywood Broward.

[00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:12.800]
That's me.

[00:52:14.240 --> 00:52:15.220]
Somebody help me, baby.

[00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:15.760]
I'm lost.

[00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:16.560]
I need a road man.

[00:52:17.060 --> 00:52:18.860]
I couldn't find Broward Boulevard with both hands.

[00:52:18.980 --> 00:52:20.780]
I live like about the stone throw from there.

[00:52:21.380 --> 00:52:25.080]
No, but there is a huge restaurant that just off the corner there.

[00:52:25.460 --> 00:52:28.040]
As you go in North, you know, on the west side of the street.

[00:52:28.500 --> 00:52:30.300]
And that thing has changed 40 billion times.

[00:52:30.300 --> 00:52:31.440]
It was a Chinese restaurant.

[00:52:31.700 --> 00:52:33.340]
It was a 40 trillion.

[00:52:33.580 --> 00:52:35.580]
And I think nobody can afford the rent in there.

[00:52:35.700 --> 00:52:36.060]
It's a problem.

[00:52:36.080 --> 00:52:38.580]
I got to do about 80 billion dollars at a business just to pay the rent.

[00:52:39.160 --> 00:52:40.860]
Because the place is humongous.

[00:52:41.980 --> 00:52:43.340]
You know, it's an interesting thing.

[00:52:43.420 --> 00:52:45.200]
I tried to tell Ponytail this long time ago,

[00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:47.260]
who called it on my anniversary, not that long ago.

[00:52:47.780 --> 00:52:48.540]
14 days ago.

[00:52:48.540 --> 00:52:49.740]
Two weeks ago, today's matter of fact.

[00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:51.260]
Let's replay the anniversary show.

[00:52:51.320 --> 00:52:51.780]
I'm not.

[00:52:52.900 --> 00:52:55.180]
I tried to tell him that there, I was thinking this yesterday.

[00:52:55.520 --> 00:52:56.160]
I don't know why.

[00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:01.180]
But there are some locations, even if they're in the middle of a place where everything else is doing great.

[00:53:01.320 --> 00:53:03.940]
But just certain, for example, we've got that right here where I am.

[00:53:05.340 --> 00:53:07.420]
There's a street that's got all these great restaurants on it.

[00:53:07.540 --> 00:53:10.120]
And in the middle of the block, there's one place and it keeps changing.

[00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:12.720]
No matter what opens up in there, it goes out of business.

[00:53:13.260 --> 00:53:14.380]
The other places all do great.

[00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:16.440]
But that just that one, you know what I mean?

[00:53:16.700 --> 00:53:18.220]
There are locations that are like cursed.

[00:53:19.460 --> 00:53:20.180]
That's exactly.

[00:53:20.520 --> 00:53:22.980]
That's what Patti Hurst said, cursed, the worst.

[00:53:24.420 --> 00:53:25.660]
Oh, 34 degrees currently.

[00:53:25.660 --> 00:53:26.480]
What's wrong with that?

[00:53:26.580 --> 00:53:26.940]
Plus one.

[00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:30.460]
I think I just got through saying that there's sky miles, whatever this has chained, that's the average.

[00:53:31.420 --> 00:53:32.660]
Where is Rob Marciano today?

[00:53:32.780 --> 00:53:33.380]
No wonder I'm depressed.

[00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:35.740]
978 votes.

[00:53:36.140 --> 00:53:38.440]
Before the half hour is over, we're going to be over a thousand.

[00:53:38.620 --> 00:53:39.880]
And things are really looking up, man.

[00:53:39.940 --> 00:53:41.180]
I think the audience is making a comeback.

[00:53:42.160 --> 00:53:43.980]
I don't think they really went anywhere on this show.

[00:53:44.100 --> 00:53:46.340]
I think maybe it was in a version of that square table.

[00:53:46.460 --> 00:53:48.200]
Maybe the thought they were going to like maybe kick something.

[00:53:49.340 --> 00:53:50.860]
Okay, it's Bob Dole.

[00:53:51.020 --> 00:53:55.640]
And Bob Dole says Bob Dole has been appointed by our glorious leader to investigate this.

[00:53:55.640 --> 00:53:59.160]
Soil and green style treatment of our wounded soldiers at Walter Reed Hospital.

[00:53:59.480 --> 00:54:00.660]
Along with Donna.

[00:54:03.140 --> 00:54:03.900]
That's Donna.

[00:54:06.260 --> 00:54:09.140]
And Bob Dole says with the capable help of Donna.

[00:54:12.520 --> 00:54:16.120]
You couldn't ask for a better team to investigate Robert Reed Hospital.

[00:54:16.780 --> 00:54:18.100]
Much like John McCain.

[00:54:18.540 --> 00:54:23.520]
I'm a decorated combat veteran, turned politician that threw my baller down the memory hole for anyone that came along.

[00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:24.300]
And I'm going to pick an up check.

[00:54:25.060 --> 00:54:28.660]
So a rest assured this thorough investigation of Walter Math,

[00:54:28.760 --> 00:54:30.540]
the biomedical hospitalism, good hand.

[00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:34.300]
And as a matter of fact, my other hand holds the hand that will endorse the check.

[00:54:34.420 --> 00:54:36.380]
I'll get from high-a.d. worldwide services.

[00:54:37.020 --> 00:54:40.200]
They say worldwide, but they're located in Florida.

[00:54:47.780 --> 00:54:48.980]
1117 and 565.

[00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:53.480]
I'll tell you this.

[00:54:58.860 --> 00:54:59.920]
I'll tell you this.

[00:55:01.520 --> 00:55:01.960]
I'll tell you this.

[00:55:01.960 --> 00:55:01.960]

[00:55:01.960 --> 00:55:01.960]

[00:55:01.960 --> 00:55:02.240]
I'll tell you this.

[00:55:02.240 --> 00:55:02.860]
I'll tell you this.

[00:55:02.880 --> 00:55:03.500]
I'll tell you this.

[00:55:03.860 --> 00:55:04.300]
I'll tell you this.

[00:55:04.300 --> 00:55:04.440]
I'll tell you this.

[00:55:04.520 --> 00:55:04.680]
I'll tell you this.

[00:55:04.680 --> 00:55:04.680]

[00:55:04.680 --> 00:55:04.680]

[00:55:04.680 --> 00:55:04.680]

[00:55:04.680 --> 00:55:05.060]
I'll tell you this.

[00:55:05.200 --> 00:55:05.700]
I'll tell you this.

[00:55:05.700 --> 00:55:06.940]
I'll tell you this.

[00:55:06.940 --> 00:55:07.000]
I'll tell you this.

[00:55:07.020 --> 00:55:08.260]
I'll tell you this.

[00:55:08.260 --> 00:55:08.700]
I'll tell you this.

[00:55:08.720 --> 00:55:09.300]
I'll tell you this.

[00:55:09.380 --> 00:55:10.120]
I'll tell you this.

[00:55:10.820 --> 00:55:12.000]
I'll tell you this.

[00:55:13.580 --> 00:55:14.660]
I'll tell you this.

[00:55:14.740 --> 00:55:15.620]
I'll tell you this.

[00:55:15.840 --> 00:55:16.540]
I'll tell you this.

[00:55:16.660 --> 00:55:20.500]
I'll tell you this.

[00:55:22.220 --> 00:55:23.320]
I'll tell you this.

Is it possible for Foddurockers to even get sick as a secretprester?

[00:57:51.920 --> 00:57:51.980]
Is it possible?

[00:57:51.980 --> 00:57:51.980]

[00:57:51.980 --> 00:57:51.980]

[00:57:51.980 --> 00:57:51.980]

[00:57:51.980 --> 00:57:51.980]

[00:57:51.980 --> 00:57:51.980]

[00:57:51.980 --> 00:57:52.960]
the other drugs people doing together?

[00:57:52.960 --> 00:57:58.740]
They had these big vats of like, you know how you go like wind shoolers in Marshall Michigan

[00:57:58.740 --> 00:58:00.540]
You used to have it like they call it bar cheese

[00:58:02.420 --> 00:58:05.540]
Okay, you know what bar cheese is no way I'm gonna put right now

[00:58:05.540 --> 00:58:12.060]
They put bread or buns or crackers on the table and in some restaurants they have like a crock of real orange looking

[00:58:13.180 --> 00:58:18.000]
Yeah, yeah, it's like butter, you know, I mean okay, and but it's credible

[00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:22.240]
Very good the edible spreadable very good spread them and say cheese

[00:58:24.280 --> 00:58:26.340]
But so what that was I talking about

[00:58:26.880 --> 00:58:34.140]
All going but anyway the fuckers they used to have that huh and man do I love that slathering maybe a little slices of pickle on there and little

[00:58:34.140 --> 00:58:35.580]
Some of that nice

[00:58:36.280 --> 00:58:38.360]
Cheese that's credible cheese mmm

[00:58:39.720 --> 00:58:41.460]
But it's gone fuckers

[00:58:42.400 --> 00:58:47.980]
Now do you know how long that fuckers was there that was there for about I would say it was 150 years

[00:58:47.980 --> 00:58:52.280]
I thought I would say maybe Abe Lincoln a there. I'm not sure I think Henry Flagler built it

[00:58:52.280 --> 00:58:54.660]
Would be surprised or you know who built

[00:58:55.680 --> 00:59:00.020]
What is the name of that restaurant that in Amsterdam and the hotel in Europe?

[00:59:00.980 --> 00:59:04.420]
Freddie Oh, not a restaurant famous bar Freddie Freddie Heineken

[00:59:04.980 --> 00:59:09.580]
Build Freddie's bar since the hotel you're which is a very overpriced very expensive hotel

[00:59:10.360 --> 00:59:12.000]
Yeah, that's right Freddie Heineken

[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:18.280]
And then an Amsterdam you go to the Heineken Brewing gets him free samples. I just mentioned that in passing too

[00:59:18.720 --> 00:59:22.340]
That was like right up the street from where my last department was I had an Amsterdam

[00:59:22.340 --> 00:59:24.020]
I think I'm gonna go back and do that again

[00:59:24.020 --> 00:59:30.180]
Give me an apartment. I'm stood on all this time. I'd like the bedrooms not underground with mold and spiders the size of bowling balls things like that

[00:59:30.180 --> 00:59:31.460]
That was probably not all that good

[00:59:32.900 --> 00:59:38.820]
I felt like little Miss Muffet every now and then because I'd sit down on the edge of my bed and long would come a spider and we got a

[00:59:38.820 --> 00:59:42.540]
Thousand four-votes Chris. Oh my god. Now it's time to go get that bar cheese

[00:59:44.160 --> 00:59:45.740]

[00:59:47.440 --> 00:59:51.020]

[00:59:56.500 --> 01:00:01.780]
You might please me please to know there's one in Canada, but it's in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, eh?

[01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:06.820]
I don't think I'm gonna be going to Saskatoon or any place else in Saskatchewan. I wonder if

[01:00:07.300 --> 01:00:09.380]
Saskatchewan turns out in Saskatchewan

[01:00:11.020 --> 01:00:14.800]
Wow, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. I wonder if that's a weird medicine head

[01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:22.900]
Thousand four votes on the pool. I'm gonna try that. Huh? Moose Chies. Moose Jaw. Yeah, I like

[01:00:22.900 --> 01:00:24.920]

What effects are just pouring in here today today's pool?

[01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:33.600]
Nations Capital. I'm sure most people realize it was named after George Washington

[01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:36.800]
What about the of C why the district of Columbia?

[01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:41.940]
Name for Christopher Columbus question mark the district of Columbia. That's a nice like question

[01:00:41.940 --> 01:00:44.660]
I haven't got any idea do you yes? What's the answer?

[01:00:44.660 --> 01:00:49.340]
Or you know the answer to this question the district of Columbia. Yes, well Columbia

[01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:55.160]
Yes, as in the city was named after Christopher Columbus. So yeah, all the Columbia Columbus

[01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:58.780]

[01:01:00.700 --> 01:01:02.740]
South Carolina, whatever it is

[01:01:02.740 --> 01:01:06.520]
Columbus South Carolina Columbia. I've got me confused all the Columbia

[01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:12.360]
Whatever's our name. I put it for Columbus. How about I Caramba that too. How about Yamama?

[01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:14.240]
So Sox and Hell

[01:01:15.300 --> 01:01:19.360]
Well, yeah, you know now we're getting down to some really nasty tributes

[01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:23.320]
But thank you very much whoever sent this in from the Floridian Surflin Lake worth

2010 votes for Lake Worth that was my first department when I worked at J.

[01:01:27.500 --> 01:01:31.100]
And on West Palm Beach was in Lake Worth and that would have been a 75 or 32 years ago

[01:01:31.100 --> 01:01:33.860]
I would have been half of my life was had gone by

[01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:38.740]
Do you understand what I'm saying? I was 32 I don't know and at 32

[01:01:38.740 --> 01:01:44.420]
I mean I was definitely not qualified. I wasn't nearly old enough to live in Lake Worth not even close not even close

[01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:49.760]
1010 that could be 1010 wins New York or could be CFRB Toronto?

[01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:15.080]
Um that that's Burger King right hold the pickle special orders don't upset us

[01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:16.180]
So right right right

[01:03:16.740 --> 01:03:17.100]
Right

[01:03:18.180 --> 01:03:22.100]
But I like a place where you can go in like that and you can like fix your own just give me the burger kind of bun

[01:03:22.100 --> 01:03:26.600]
Don't butter the bun please. Okay. You don't get butter the buns. I'll have the runs. I'm telling you right now

[01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:31.920]
Or good nice good. Yeah, you know char hot where you're right there on the other side of the counter from the person fixing your burger

[01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:35.600]
And you can just point to the something and say more lessons right that's right. That's all right

[01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:40.640]
It's more or less unless you're right to model like I told you after I used to go to my pill doctor there in Tamarack

[01:03:41.460 --> 01:03:45.760]
Almost every single time because obviously when you're gonna go get blood taken you be gonna be fasting all day

[01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:47.280]
So I was starving and it would be after work

[01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:52.860]
So it would get to be like three o'clock, you know, I'd have the blood drawn and and on a way down the knob Hill road

[01:03:52.860 --> 01:03:55.160]
There's a char hot right there and

[01:03:55.160 --> 01:03:59.060]
Every time I go through that drive through and fact I should be getting free char hot every Wednesday too

[01:03:59.060 --> 01:04:03.340]
You know, Duff is really sticking it to you man. You know guys don't even feel it. He's sticking it to you. I feel it

[01:04:04.060 --> 01:04:09.600]
Do you the hurts Chris doesn't need it though because the thing with Chris is he eats the bun when they bring it to burgers and stuff

[01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:14.760]
You eat the bun. Why do you do that? I mean George's George's whole family is at Kensing it and they're not a bunch of big fat

[01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:17.200]
Slums they could use it in a couple of pounds, but yeah

[01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:19.780]
Well, why are you eating buns? What is wrong with you man?

[01:04:20.340 --> 01:04:22.940]
Because it's yummy. I imagine no it is nice

[01:04:24.100 --> 01:04:28.120]
See I love bread you like bread. Oh

[01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:34.540]
Chris loves it more than both of us. Yeah, well drop the buns for seven Americans suffers from a terrible affliction

[01:04:35.060 --> 01:04:40.060]
And while others find it funny for those who have it it's no laughing matter

[01:04:40.060 --> 01:04:48.620]
It's called frequent burping syndrome. It's terrible. I'll I'll be on a date or a business meeting and

[01:04:49.580 --> 01:04:49.640]
and

[01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:55.760]

Although now that you know everybody in the audience is heading for Chick-fil-A. I just got a message here everybody

[01:06:14.620 --> 01:06:16.880]

Now where's the oh there's that the fart one we can't play that

[01:06:29.120 --> 01:06:37.620]
Which one the one that goes some parts I feel oh yeah that one like that. Yeah, that's my favorite one a couple of these in it. Uh-huh

[01:07:02.620 --> 01:07:03.560]
Oh, wait, we probably could play this

[01:07:16.380 --> 01:07:16.720]
�

[01:07:35.420 --> 01:07:36.220]
Don't you love that?

[01:07:36.220 --> 01:07:40.240]
I wonder what this one. No, this is not a good one and that one we can't play we can play this

[01:07:40.660 --> 01:07:41.180]
I'm right

[01:07:41.740 --> 01:07:45.760]
You know how much you've been like this old jovido put your finger way up and you know

[01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:47.660]
It's on the scratch where your brain used to be

[01:07:53.040 --> 01:07:54.480]
Love is the capital stuff

[01:07:56.980 --> 01:07:58.140]
That's what I said the first time

[01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:01.320]
Yeah

[01:08:01.320 --> 01:08:05.080]
What do I know from one year

[01:08:06.680 --> 01:08:07.900]
Except that she wants another

[01:08:07.900 --> 01:08:12.180]
I don't know eight or one she was good

[01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:15.600]
The waffle fries it was a good chicken sound

[01:08:17.400 --> 01:08:18.880]
You know what I'm like

[01:08:19.780 --> 01:08:20.740]
Red necks

[01:08:20.740 --> 01:08:23.520]
Real Yahoo red necks that's America for you baby

[01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:28.580]
See I did this once before and it's a very ugly thing because most people most of us

[01:08:28.580 --> 01:08:32.840]
If it's like the people listen to the legend or the ranger show we're a little more sophisticated than that okay

[01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:36.640]
I mean if we stick our finger way up on our nose we're not doing it because we want to scratch our brain

[01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:40.080]
We're doing it because there's something that we want to yank out when it doubt yank it out

[01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:46.080]
But I'm telling it so what's the story because I don't want any of my close personal friends going over to chickfully in

[01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:50.960]
Miramar anywhere else to have lunch and then find out that they came back puking their guts out or like with wild explosive

[01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:53.480]
Diarrhea for the rest of the day and then blame me for it

[01:08:53.480 --> 01:08:57.220]
So it's not fancy. It's just a good chicken sandwiches and a waffle fries

[01:08:57.220 --> 01:09:01.400]
Well, so what's wrong with that nothing now they got the cheese waffle fries like they do with the

[01:09:01.400 --> 01:09:04.220]
I don't know I didn't really mean you don't know

[01:09:04.220 --> 01:09:06.440]
I think there once it was in the mall it was in the food

[01:09:06.440 --> 01:09:09.660]
Chris didn't say that asked me anything. I've got the answer. I think that's what George told me

[01:09:09.660 --> 01:09:12.480]
And that's all they got no he took a swamy hat off them

[01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:16.160]
I bet you couldn't ask the tapes any question joebell you still a person you

[01:09:17.380 --> 01:09:21.780]
Columbia is the capital South Carolina 120,000 people says this fact. It says hi George see

[01:09:21.780 --> 01:09:23.860]
I'm not even here. I'm even

[01:09:23.860 --> 01:09:27.260]
It's because I was a waffling back and forth speaking over the wall

[01:09:27.260 --> 01:09:31.580]
Waffling on it. I was also flying back and forth. You know, it's one of those things where if you say it enough

[01:09:31.580 --> 01:09:32.800]
It's like oh, I know

[01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:37.000]
What I mean is it is not always Columbia where every time I drive to North Carolina I drive past

[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.960]
I know Columbus South Carolina. I knew that whatever there's a lot of

[01:09:40.480 --> 01:09:40.880]
Columbus

[01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:45.580]
I'm gonna name it after Christopher Columbus. Why can't they calling this Columbus Ohio right in my right?

[01:09:45.700 --> 01:09:50.500]
That's what Ohio State is in Columbus. So I that's where the uh the straight jackets play the Columbus straight jackets

[01:09:50.500 --> 01:09:54.180]
And that's where Jeff Reemer works your close personal friend speaking to something that won't buy you long

[01:09:54.180 --> 01:09:57.740]
Because usually when they name a land after someone they put that IA at the end of it

[01:09:58.340 --> 01:10:01.100]
Like Nelia that state named up me. Yeah. Yeah

[01:10:02.520 --> 01:10:04.580]
You know the district of Nelia named up for you

[01:10:05.740 --> 01:10:06.600]
How about failure

[01:10:08.300 --> 01:10:08.660]
Yeah

[01:10:09.540 --> 01:10:10.740]
Get out of here already

[01:10:12.160 --> 01:10:16.120]
1027 votes on the pool. I'm gonna tell you something that I think it was the Marlon game yesterday

[01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:20.740]
I wait a minute. Let's see waffle fries rule. Oh here we go

[01:10:20.740 --> 01:10:25.180]
I've been to the one in daylenses my buddy here and it's good with a you know all these winking at the end

[01:10:25.180 --> 01:10:26.860]
You know always be careful. We got a winks a lot

[01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:32.840]
Winking blanket and not know the one and day. Yeah, so I don't know everybody else's is pretty good

[01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:38.540]
Your your course you are so damn hard to please anyway, you know what did I say? I said it was pretty good

[01:10:38.540 --> 01:10:42.740]
You say there are decent chicken sandwich and you said something about wild diarrhea or something

[01:10:42.740 --> 01:10:47.860]
Oh, yeah, didn't you say that Chris? It says unfancy as a place can be but it was that

[01:10:50.900 --> 01:10:55.300]
Yeah, it's obvious. It's not such a big honor. We're gonna be in hockey players boy talking about lunch. Wow

[01:10:56.500 --> 01:11:01.560]
1334 on the pool. I just got so much good stuff going on here. It's all good like bubble would say it's all good

[01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:06.880]
In fact, I wouldn't be surprised. I'm trying to think of what I seem to fill a maybe where flood workers used to be

[01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:10.160]
Or here's your buddy Moishi also everybody's in on this all right

[01:11:11.180 --> 01:11:11.540]
Oh

[01:11:12.260 --> 01:11:16.440]
It says the owner of it is a hard-core evangelical. Maybe that's why they make such a big deal

[01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:17.500]
Well, I had a

[01:11:17.500 --> 01:11:21.600]
On the email before on my space a guy one of our regulars. He said to me

[01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:26.100]
He said he wanted to because they close on Sunday because the owners of religious

[01:11:26.100 --> 01:11:31.120]
He said I'm not gonna go somewhere where they force the employees to do well. I mean they give them the day off anyway

[01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:36.180]
You know managed on a halalah has that never on a Sunday and who wants to eat chick-fil-a on Sunday anyway, right?

[01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:40.100]
Right aren't you supposed to or supposed to order off for pizza on Sunday or something like that?

[01:11:40.580 --> 01:11:41.080]
Oh for me

Kind of King Clancy

[01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:56.220]
1334 votes. See isn't it amazing that you live in a place where all this is like if I talk in a foreign language, you know

[01:11:56.220 --> 01:11:57.340]

[01:11:59.380 --> 01:12:03.040]
Oh, this guy's good. The next guy announced you I have no idea what his name is. He's very good

[01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:06.600]

[01:12:07.900 --> 01:12:10.140]

And I'm really sorry apologize for that especially if anybody has a bad meal because of me today, but I'm sure they won't

[01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:22.780]
Do I do I ever turn people on to bad food? I don't think so nobody nobody is fantasized

[01:12:22.780 --> 01:12:26.440]

[01:13:25.880 --> 01:13:32.780]
What is that about America? You know we started the thing with all the the rest stops and all the exits on the highways on the interstates

[01:13:33.380 --> 01:13:37.540]
By the way, thank Ike Eisenhower for all the interstate highways. That was his idea good things like one Ike

[01:13:38.140 --> 01:13:45.900]
And we started with that and they're at almost every major intersection there's like a McDonald's and a Burger King and a Wendy's and a Taco Bell and a pizza Hut and whatever

[01:13:45.900 --> 01:13:47.480]

[01:13:59.220 --> 01:14:02.500]
Chee Gordon Lydia and they don't come any worse than Neil Rodriguez

[01:14:05.200 --> 01:14:05.760]
Hello

[01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:10.660]
Hello, I'm conservative pundit and culture recently. I called Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards

[01:14:10.660 --> 01:14:15.760]
Now apparently the liberal left wing tree hugging media had suddenly decided

[01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:20.580]
F**k it is a bad word. Hello. Did you hear the applause I got when I said it?

[01:14:21.340 --> 01:14:21.540]
Huh

[01:14:21.540 --> 01:14:27.920]
Anyway, I've been asked to make a retraction. So here goes John Edwards is not a f**k

[01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:31.740]
What I make to say is John Edwards is a pillow biting rump ranger

[01:14:32.500 --> 01:14:33.500]
That's still okay, right?

[01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:41.300]
Hi, this is Isaiah Washington from Grey's Anatomy. I've learned a hard way that words can hurt

[01:14:41.860 --> 01:14:44.480]
While and culture may be beloved by millions

[01:14:45.060 --> 01:14:48.960]
She wouldn't like it if I called her a bony flat-chested horse face

[01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:52.200]
Even if it's true, huh, which it is

[01:14:52.740 --> 01:14:58.980]
So remember never call anyone a f**k because f**k is very sensitive

[01:15:00.020 --> 01:15:01.180]
Thank you

[01:15:01.180 --> 01:15:05.040]
Yeah, we're done now. I should hold those c**k

[01:15:07.980 --> 01:15:12.380]
Yeah, Timmy you know, oh Timmy harder way if you could have been a bookkeeper this morning you would have uptruck breakfast

[01:15:27.900 --> 01:15:32.460]

[01:15:36.060 --> 01:15:42.140]
Chick-fil-A no in my kitchen. No, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go do a kitchen celebrity chicken neck never answered my question

[01:15:42.140 --> 01:15:46.580]
I tell you what I'm gonna do there was a guy on TV a hundred years ago wasn't her best Riner said that

[01:15:46.580 --> 01:15:51.240]
Who don't used to say that? I thought you what I'm gonna do. Huh? I thought you what I'm going to do

[01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:55.900]
Yeah, but whoever he's dead. I'm sure he's dead. So he can be he ain't gonna be doing anything at this point

[01:15:55.900 --> 01:16:01.600]
But I'm gonna go to a Taco Bell and get that you know the breeder with no beans. Oh, I hate beans. Oh

[01:16:02.180 --> 01:16:05.060]
It's unclean that old bean you never know where it's been

[01:16:06.080 --> 01:16:11.240]
And then especially those moushi beans, you know like the Mexicans like a lot the moushi refried beans

[01:16:11.860 --> 01:16:15.500]
Well, what does that really mean? Refried beans when he came right down look let's start

[01:16:15.500 --> 01:16:21.380]
Let's start thinking about some of this food that we know KB before we start continuing our selves for somebody else's fun and profit

[01:16:21.380 --> 01:16:24.260]
Let's start thinking about let's start analyzing it a little bit

[01:16:24.260 --> 01:16:26.900]
I'll go find a refried beater that can explain it to us

[01:16:26.900 --> 01:16:30.800]
I bet you an echo vocal you'll find plenty of

[01:16:31.460 --> 01:16:34.260]
A refried beater and maybe it's a border you'll find some too

[01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:39.340]
Refried and each shot or maybe retried how about a retried beater?

[01:16:40.640 --> 01:16:44.940]
Oh, I'm gonna go and get that breeder supreme with no beans and I'm gonna make up my low carb pasta

[01:16:44.940 --> 01:16:47.460]
I remember I did that once before. Oh, man

[01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:53.460]
Like you use that stuff on your like with the sour cream and the olives and all the other good stuff

[01:16:53.460 --> 01:16:59.680]
And send a little a chunk of tomatoes. You don't like really like cook cook for yourself like get a frying pan out and brown

[01:16:59.680 --> 01:17:04.460]
Your beef and all that's in great while. Okay, I move to do that because they sell you know mixes

[01:17:04.460 --> 01:17:08.000]
Taco Bell mixes where you can mix up your own like taco meat. Oh

[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:12.200]
I want to go through all of that. I mean I'm lazy old you want me to go through all of that

[01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:12.880]
nonsense

[01:17:12.880 --> 01:17:17.560]
I want you to sit there on your fat ass and order out

[01:17:18.460 --> 01:17:19.680]
What mean order out?

[01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:25.100]
But they have Chinese delivery over there. Yeah, they do. I'm not gonna do that. I'm not that lazy

[01:17:25.100 --> 01:17:30.760]
Okay, I walk at least a block and I have to get to my nearest Taco Bell. Maybe two blocks when you come right down to it

[01:17:32.360 --> 01:17:37.700]
I'm gonna say to you again the only reason that I'm alive here today the only reason is because I'm here

[01:17:37.700 --> 01:17:42.680]
Five years of walking no car right I walk and this is the truth

[01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:47.280]
I walk more in one day being here than I would if I was done here in any year

[01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:51.640]
Well in one day we're working. I walk first of all in plantation acres. There are no sidewalks by me

[01:17:51.640 --> 01:17:55.020]
There's nowhere to walk you can take your life in your hands and walk you know

[01:17:55.020 --> 01:18:00.220]
You know where I live where we're even to walk like I'm on the grass in the weeds

[01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:05.100]
We're all the fall and malalucatries many of them are still like down from the hurricane 100 years ago

[01:18:05.100 --> 01:18:06.880]
I mean where you gonna walk there's nowhere to walk

[01:18:07.500 --> 01:18:11.300]
Like Martha and the band-dellars would say nowhere to run nowhere to hide. I do love Martha and the band-dellars

[01:18:11.300 --> 01:18:14.760]
I love that most time when you please tell me to watch that again before I watch raising your Arizona

[01:18:14.760 --> 01:18:19.120]
And if that guy calls into the day and say how'd you like that movie didn't watch it yet? Okay. I'll let you know

[01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:23.360]
Because you know me if I do watch it one of the first things I'll talk about in the morning when I come on

[01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:28.360]
Right is I'll say hey I watched that movie last night with Francis McDorman and Dennis Quaid. Oh, he keeps calling

[01:18:28.360 --> 01:18:30.480]
You know he's gonna be overhyping it. Yeah

[01:18:31.660 --> 01:18:34.160]
Martha and the band-dellars baby little low-town sound fact

[01:18:34.160 --> 01:18:36.020]
We should have a jingle would have been good

[01:18:36.020 --> 01:18:37.900]
Not too late. You want to start it again?

[01:18:37.900 --> 01:18:39.500]
for CKW

[01:18:39.500 --> 01:18:40.720]
What down sound?

[01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:44.720]
Now that's not good. It's the it's off the computer here

[01:18:45.840 --> 01:18:50.800]
Yeah, but you got it all right. I'll do better when when they get to the point where they're singing on old town

[01:18:50.800 --> 01:18:51.820]
I'll make up for the delay

[01:18:55.480 --> 01:18:59.900]
I think we could use a little work. Yeah, all right. We'll work on it

[01:19:00.720 --> 01:19:02.300]
We're gonna do one more time. All right. One more time

[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:04.360]
CKW

[01:19:04.360 --> 01:19:06.020]
What down sound?

[01:19:07.040 --> 01:19:07.400]
CKW

[01:19:07.400 --> 01:19:12.920]
You're letting the whole jingle and before you're a star. I think that you're hearing it differently because of our delay between us subtle

[01:19:12.920 --> 01:19:17.200]
No, I'm not what about hearing it differently. How does it all down here man? You're on crazy

[01:19:17.200 --> 01:19:22.180]
How does it all? I'm known it for 17 years and I've got proof. Well, what how can I be here? You know what that's like?

[01:19:22.180 --> 01:19:27.120]
That's like that thing we discussed about farce right because I think I think you're smelling it differently than I am

[01:19:27.120 --> 01:19:32.340]
But it's the same it's the same thing in the air there believe me at lingers and I don't want it on my fingers

[01:19:32.340 --> 01:19:37.420]
Oh, I'm a lingers and the same with this and it's a sound. It's like it doesn't bear

[01:19:37.420 --> 01:19:44.060]
But you hear the jingle let's try you hear the jingle line when the jingle starts. That's when you hit it. Okay

[01:19:46.780 --> 01:19:49.220]
There you go. That's a little bit better. Not not great

[01:19:49.660 --> 01:19:51.340]
All right, here starts

[01:19:52.080 --> 01:19:52.880]
That's when you hit

[01:19:53.540 --> 01:19:58.880]
The thing is there's a delay between us going away. You need to notice it. I did oh the load night minus eight

[01:19:58.880 --> 01:20:02.620]
See we had a couple of teas days here and that's going to be well a little taste of wintertime again

[01:20:02.620 --> 01:20:05.440]
That's all right. Don't bother me look. I said you'd dress for it

[01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:07.360]
You put on a nice a nice gown, you know

[01:20:08.240 --> 01:20:11.540]
You put on your nice stockings that come up to your crotch

[01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:15.380]
What do they call those those long johns? What's it? Oh, yeah?

[01:20:17.640 --> 01:20:23.260]
What kind of people dress like that? Okay, and then of course the other of north the Scotsman man the Scottish

[01:20:23.260 --> 01:20:28.740]
You know, I guess I'm finally figuring out if you live long enough you figure certain things out

[01:20:28.880 --> 01:20:34.360]
Why they ask so ridiculous up there and that's because the weather you know when I'm in Europe and I'm watching the BBC or even here

[01:20:34.360 --> 01:20:41.880]
I can watch it or the um sky TV and they show the weather and it's even if it's like sunny and nice in Berlin or Amsterdam or anywhere on the continent

[01:20:42.340 --> 01:20:51.060]
In the British Isles I would say 90 at least 90% of the time the weather is really to grotesque and depressing and it's dank and it's dripping and it's like

[01:20:51.060 --> 01:20:55.940]
It's like it's like the clouds over the British Riles have post nasal drip and it's always dripping

[01:20:55.940 --> 01:20:57.200]
It's like there's some bad

[01:20:57.960 --> 01:21:03.080]
Sexually transmitted disease that it's infected the world family and everybody else as well

[01:21:03.860 --> 01:21:08.400]
My association and so like Scotland of course being way there up north if you think it's bad like in London

[01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:09.900]
When you get up to the northern part

[01:21:09.900 --> 01:21:11.300]
It's always there always showing all these

[01:21:11.760 --> 01:21:15.560]
Gales and winds and oh it's among and ice and crap

[01:21:15.560 --> 01:21:20.040]
So that's why they have to do these bizarre things to like you know because the weather affects their mind

[01:21:20.040 --> 01:21:25.280]
I guess didn't they invent golf the Scottish they did what does that tell you all I need to

[01:21:25.940 --> 01:21:31.860]
That's all we need to know is that the Scottish invented golf and they don't speak regular English they speak gay lick

[01:21:32.600 --> 01:21:36.420]
Or something and there's nothing like a gay lick or several of them

[01:21:36.420 --> 01:21:40.040]
Okay, 1555 votes in a pool while I'm telling you that what what is it lately?

[01:21:40.120 --> 01:21:42.780]
I'm just wiggy and I'm just I think it was the chick-fil-a thing

[01:21:43.300 --> 01:21:49.240]
Now you notice how I have done that story and everybody all my buddies out there are going to chick-fil-a for lunch today and probably like I said

[01:21:49.240 --> 01:21:53.000]
Gonna have wild intestinal grip or something like that. What is an intestinal grip?

[01:21:53.560 --> 01:21:57.300]
G-R-I-P-P-E remember these these that's a real bad experience

[01:21:57.300 --> 01:22:02.580]
I don't know is that like the vapors like like stomach flu and then I find out the original said stings stomach flu

[01:22:02.580 --> 01:22:04.980]
That's just a somebody made that crap up. They did?

[01:22:05.220 --> 01:22:05.380]
They did?

[01:22:06.040 --> 01:22:06.440]
Yeah

[01:22:07.160 --> 01:22:09.180]
You think there is such a thing as a sign of five?

[01:22:09.200 --> 01:22:12.200]
I don't know maybe I don't know I just made that up too

[01:22:13.280 --> 01:22:16.380]
Grip G-R-I-P-P-E hit a grip man get a grip

[01:22:16.780 --> 01:22:17.740]
I already got some

[01:22:17.740 --> 01:22:18.620]
I bet

[01:22:20.060 --> 01:22:20.780]
1555 votes

[01:22:20.780 --> 01:22:24.680]
You ought to be ecstatic today you don't have all that the tar the tar baby on her

[01:22:24.680 --> 01:22:25.480]
I am

[01:22:26.160 --> 01:22:27.980]
You ought to be I really am

[01:22:27.980 --> 01:22:31.840]
I hope you hear this morning the Mexicans were not there. I was just doing a handsprick

[01:22:31.840 --> 01:22:32.940]
Are you starting to pick on the beaners again?

[01:22:33.320 --> 01:22:35.400]
Oh look at this here some more of this stuff they're doing for tomorrow

[01:22:35.400 --> 01:22:37.340]
Well you know what I made a mistake before

[01:22:37.900 --> 01:22:38.880]
What and you need

[01:22:38.880 --> 01:22:41.520]
Ah today's Thursday this is how it wasn't tonight

[01:22:41.520 --> 01:22:43.860]
Why didn't you interrupt me this is not Wednesday

[01:22:44.300 --> 01:22:49.720]
God about what one thing if I'm because I read the DUI checkpoint that was for last night in lauderdale lakes

[01:22:49.720 --> 01:22:54.620]
Oh, I miss Wednesday. I keep thinking it's Wednesday and you want to know why because I forgot about wood buying Wednesday

[01:22:54.620 --> 01:22:55.700]
I mean I went but

[01:22:55.700 --> 01:22:58.720]
It was mostly a non-event I lost a little bit not all that much

[01:22:58.720 --> 01:23:02.440]
I was never ahead at any point. I was never behind all that much and it was and for me

[01:23:02.440 --> 01:23:05.840]
That's like a major miracle lately, you know. I was kissing my machine man

[01:23:06.980 --> 01:23:11.180]
But this is a timely this one's for tomorrow apologize by the way lauderdale lakes the coast is clear

[01:23:11.740 --> 01:23:15.020]
You have to get plastered as my suggestion in fact if you're going to be anywhere near lauderdale

[01:23:15.020 --> 01:23:16.980]
It's probably a good idea to get plastered first

[01:23:17.940 --> 01:23:23.440]
BSO deputies will conduct DUI saturation patrols tomorrow from 8 30 tomorrow night until approximately

[01:23:23.440 --> 01:23:27.740]

I'll drag your ass away. Nobody's ever going to see you again. I put you in one of George Bush's ghoulogs

That's a lot of hours baby is Robert Creeper would say yeah

[01:24:00.400 --> 01:24:05.200]
Is that Robert Creeper the Great Reaper the Lord of the Board? That's the one if he's seriously if he says that again

[01:24:05.200 --> 01:24:10.920]
I'm just I don't know what I'm gonna do. I may just I may just do the show out on the patio in my underwear

That's what I told Brady Quinn I said wherever you got a thousand sixty two votes is what we got

[01:24:39.940 --> 01:24:46.320]

If this is red shit now so I bounce down the road in a bit that is super bad way

[01:25:29.320 --> 01:25:34.520]

[01:26:28.400 --> 01:26:33.480]
Sweating fresh with all seeds thoughts dispel and gets the dusty look in over time.

[01:26:34.860 --> 01:26:39.180]

[01:26:42.920 --> 01:26:44.020]
The whole baby.

[01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:48.920]
Over the crocodile cherry cherry, baby, baby.

[01:26:48.940 --> 01:26:50.740]
Dog baby.

[01:26:51.540 --> 01:26:55.320]
My little shopping queen's throwing over Steve Lovas in the school.

[01:26:55.820 --> 01:26:57.280]
Dog baby.

[01:26:58.420 --> 01:27:01.520]
Fresh, melodic, dear, you'll be better to be a baby.

[01:27:02.120 --> 01:27:03.880]
Dog baby.

[01:27:04.560 --> 01:27:06.620]
Baby, baby, baby, baby.

[01:27:07.040 --> 01:27:14.380]
The couple of three of five sixty WM Homo Chick-fil-A, baby, now probably shouldn't say that because the guy next door over there, KFC, loves us and remembers he sent a bunch of food and stuff.

[01:27:14.600 --> 01:27:16.460]
He said a nice, nobody loves me, he loves you.

[01:27:16.660 --> 01:27:18.420]
He might even look like, I'm gonna say love.

[01:27:18.540 --> 01:27:19.560]
Might even like Chris a little bit.

[01:27:20.520 --> 01:27:23.600]
Well, Chris hasn't been there long enough for anybody who wants to love him yet, you know.

[01:27:24.040 --> 01:27:24.280]
You think?

[01:27:24.580 --> 01:27:25.680]
To love someone bad.

[01:27:25.820 --> 01:27:27.460]
If you loved by the audience, Chris or not.

[01:27:27.820 --> 01:27:28.100]
Nah.

[01:27:28.700 --> 01:27:29.500]
No, not yet.

[01:27:29.700 --> 01:27:30.560]
A little bit too soon for that.

[01:27:30.720 --> 01:27:34.740]
You know, I mean, don't start, you know, kissing on the first day, being a little bit too, you know, keep a distance.

[01:27:35.200 --> 01:27:37.480]
And then on the second day, that's when you come into the kill.

[01:27:37.800 --> 01:27:40.360]
1,071 hosts will go over 100,5 hours.

[01:27:41.400 --> 01:27:43.180]
I'm thinking like 13 today, aren't you?

[01:27:43.280 --> 01:27:44.580]
Are you thinking like 13,00-ish?

[01:27:44.880 --> 01:27:45.580]
Yes, I was about to.

[01:27:45.840 --> 01:27:46.920]
That sounds good to me.

[01:27:47.080 --> 01:27:47.540]
I think it works.

[01:27:47.740 --> 01:27:48.220]
It works for me.

[01:27:48.480 --> 01:27:50.020]
Here's the Marlon pre-game show, by the way.

[01:27:51.640 --> 01:27:53.040]
I think playing today or what?

[01:27:54.120 --> 01:27:54.560]
I wish.

[01:27:55.260 --> 01:27:56.120]
Oh, come on.

[01:27:56.640 --> 01:27:57.740]
Be a sport, man.

[01:27:58.280 --> 01:28:00.180]
Well, it's like every day, but not every day on the air.

[01:28:00.440 --> 01:28:01.700]
I know we don't carry all the games though.

[01:28:01.700 --> 01:28:03.540]
What kind of a public service is that?

[01:28:03.720 --> 01:28:09.280]
If we're real Marlon people, I'm, where the hell is what I'm looking for?

[01:28:09.400 --> 01:28:10.000]
I can't find it.

[01:28:10.720 --> 01:28:14.440]
I'm looking for the Marlon's baseball schedule for the pre-game broadcast and regular.

[01:28:14.740 --> 01:28:18.120]
I printed that when I was down there in Florida, and now I can't find the van thing.

[01:28:18.200 --> 01:28:21.160]
I can't find the dang thing as Buddy Bud Pax will say the dang.

[01:28:21.320 --> 01:28:22.760]
Those dang Italians, you know.

[01:28:23.900 --> 01:28:24.820]
Fony Baloney, baby.

[01:28:24.900 --> 01:28:27.860]
That's Buddy Bud Pax and Fony is a $44.5 bill.

[01:28:28.900 --> 01:28:30.220]
I can't find the damn thing.

[01:28:30.360 --> 01:28:30.820]
That's sad.

[01:28:31.120 --> 01:28:31.660]
Marlon's schedule.

[01:28:31.920 --> 01:28:33.740]
Because it would be nice to know, but for show.

[01:28:35.680 --> 01:28:36.760]
It's in my pile somewhere.

[01:28:36.920 --> 01:28:40.680]
See, I have this, I do have a bad habit of doing stuff as far as being disorganized.

[01:28:41.100 --> 01:28:43.360]
And it is like I've got all these different piles of papers.

[01:28:43.760 --> 01:28:47.140]
Like over, over in front of my, in front of the DCS where the keyboard is, you know.

[01:28:48.700 --> 01:28:50.000]
I've got, it's the pool pile.

[01:28:50.160 --> 01:28:51.180]
I've got all these piles of pools.

[01:28:51.420 --> 01:28:53.600]
And then there's some other sort of stuff that I don't want to lose.

[01:28:53.780 --> 01:28:55.900]
Like, hey, it's the Wednesday checkpoint, even though it's Thursday.

[01:28:56.160 --> 01:28:57.240]
I can't believe you let me do that.

[01:28:57.240 --> 01:28:59.500]
I mean, I believe that I did it because I'm an idiot, you know.

[01:28:59.660 --> 01:28:59.900]
And I'm old.

[01:28:59.920 --> 01:29:01.180]
Yeah, I wasn't paying any attention.

[01:29:01.720 --> 01:29:02.020]
Yeah.

[01:29:02.480 --> 01:29:05.340]
I don't have any, I don't have any email from Norma Kent by the way saying,

[01:29:05.340 --> 01:29:08.260]
hey, guess what, Joe Bell and I just reupt you a deal for another six years, Neil.

[01:29:08.540 --> 01:29:10.840]
I don't have anything like that in front of me in my pile of papers.

[01:29:11.520 --> 01:29:15.240]
He's probably having another verbal war with Jolly Joe Bell and I have no idea why.

[01:29:15.740 --> 01:29:18.180]
Because Jolly Joe just loves my Pimpley Fatal Lass.

[01:29:18.280 --> 01:29:19.720]
I'm telling that right now, don't you believe that?

[01:29:20.120 --> 01:29:20.660]
Sure, why not.

[01:29:20.940 --> 01:29:23.540]
In fact, I think Jolly Joe loves any Pimpley Fatal Lass.

[01:29:24.240 --> 01:29:26.940]
Nearly six and ten Americans want to see you as truthfully verac,

[01:29:27.040 --> 01:29:29.480]
either immediately or within a year and more would rather have Congress

[01:29:29.480 --> 01:29:33.300]
when you were asking the conflict than President Bush, then President Dumbo,

[01:29:33.660 --> 01:29:36.840]
then that butcher of Washington, the butcher of DC, District of Columbia,

[01:29:37.240 --> 01:29:37.600]
Columbia.

[01:29:38.040 --> 01:29:40.840]
I wonder if that was named after your ex-governor's wife, Columbia.

[01:29:41.860 --> 01:29:42.760]
The smuggling bitch.

[01:29:43.420 --> 01:29:43.640]
Mm-hmm.

[01:29:44.040 --> 01:29:48.120]
Those support for Bush's decision in this batch, or maybe it was named after his drug-adicted daughter,

[01:29:48.440 --> 01:29:50.400]
or maybe it was named after the son George P, you know,

[01:29:50.480 --> 01:29:53.420]
the one that was driving him out in Wheelies and his girlfriend's parking lot.

[01:29:53.420 --> 01:29:54.820]
Because he's a crazy person.

[01:29:55.140 --> 01:29:57.720]
Or now, or was it the other, how many senses he got?

[01:29:57.840 --> 01:29:59.060]
Are there two that I'm confusing with?

[01:30:00.160 --> 01:30:00.440]
I don't know.

[01:30:00.640 --> 01:30:02.060]
George P, who used to be really cute by the way,

[01:30:02.080 --> 01:30:04.460]
I hate to say that because it sounds very faggy, you know.

[01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:05.660]
But he was.

[01:30:06.220 --> 01:30:09.240]
And then the other one, I think, that was like banging his girlfriend in broad daylight

[01:30:09.240 --> 01:30:11.380]
and the parking lot of some shopping mall in Tallahatchee.

[01:30:11.420 --> 01:30:12.240]
Yeah, that's a different one.

[01:30:12.520 --> 01:30:13.620]
Oh, that's a different one, yeah.

[01:30:14.920 --> 01:30:16.740]
Well, at least the whole family is dysfunctional.

[01:30:16.760 --> 01:30:17.380]
There's nothing like that.

[01:30:17.600 --> 01:30:19.580]
The wife is a smuggler in a liar.

[01:30:19.580 --> 01:30:26.160]
The husband, Jim, he's a fat ass liar that has devious plans to screw the public over everywhere he can.

[01:30:26.740 --> 01:30:28.680]
And then, of course, the daughters of a crackhead.

[01:30:29.160 --> 01:30:30.020]
No, sorry, just said.

[01:30:30.560 --> 01:30:31.760]
Did you say the daughter was a crackhead?

[01:30:32.400 --> 01:30:33.120]
No, well, no.

[01:30:33.120 --> 01:30:33.380]
All right, that.

[01:30:33.640 --> 01:30:35.160]
No, well, it's the last of the well, baby.

[01:30:35.240 --> 01:30:36.380]
Don't be picking on the last of the well.

[01:30:36.600 --> 01:30:39.860]
Even though it's Easter time, I think it's not too early to start thinking about Christmas, man.

[01:30:40.160 --> 01:30:41.900]
Ha, ha, ha.

[01:30:42.500 --> 01:30:49.000]
Though it's support for Bush's decision to dispatch additional troops to record a 37% from 32% in a mid-January poll.

[01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:53.400]
A slim majority of 52% say Congress should block funding for that new deployment.

[01:30:53.660 --> 01:30:57.720]
Only crazy people would say, let's send some more people over there for human sacrifice.

[01:30:58.060 --> 01:31:02.480]
And then we can read more stories about how the hospitals are mistreating them and treating them like garbage, and how they're going to.

[01:31:02.660 --> 01:31:10.320]
Then they had one soldier around, was it last night or the night before on the nightly news, who's been, he has been hit by IEDs five times in Iraq.

[01:31:10.600 --> 01:31:11.260]
Five times.

[01:31:12.940 --> 01:31:13.700]
How do you like that?

[01:31:15.020 --> 01:31:15.740]
Five IEDs.

[01:31:15.740 --> 01:31:19.700]
After the first one, when you think that would be like enough, you'd think.

[01:31:20.380 --> 01:31:20.580]
Yeah.

[01:31:21.260 --> 01:31:21.580]
God.

[01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.300]
I did that one time, about 15 years old.

[01:31:24.500 --> 01:31:24.660]
Yeah.

[01:31:25.060 --> 01:31:25.420]
Had a brain.

[01:31:26.240 --> 01:31:27.580]
It's your buddy, Scotty Mack, how's he doing?

[01:31:27.680 --> 01:31:28.200]
You see him again?

[01:31:28.720 --> 01:31:29.140]
Not lately.

[01:31:30.740 --> 01:31:31.720]
He's having a bad later.

[01:31:32.340 --> 01:31:35.700]
I just want you people who are going to eat a chick filet and really makes no difference to me.

[01:31:35.760 --> 01:31:39.100]
I'm not one of those people that like the Christian yellow pages and the atheist yellow pages.

[01:31:39.280 --> 01:31:40.000]
Who cares, you know?

[01:31:40.140 --> 01:31:41.740]
If you've got a bit of a product, I'll even buy it.

[01:31:41.820 --> 01:31:42.300]
I'll try it.

[01:31:43.100 --> 01:31:47.360]
But he's an evangelical wild man, I guess, evidently.

[01:31:47.380 --> 01:31:48.140]
So, so they say.

[01:31:49.780 --> 01:31:51.680]
The CNN poll was conducted Friday through Sunday.

[01:31:51.860 --> 01:31:53.700]
Bush, you haven't got to be, but I will, we don't care.

[01:31:53.980 --> 01:31:54.600]
Very boring.

[01:31:55.100 --> 01:32:01.040]
5.670560, pound 560 in the Verizon singular wireless line, 1077 votes.

[01:32:01.200 --> 01:32:03.300]
This poll isn't even worth reading the result, you know?

[01:32:04.120 --> 01:32:04.620]
The only reason.

[01:32:05.080 --> 01:32:06.380]
And again, I don't believe it anyway.

[01:32:07.380 --> 01:32:11.620]
How many people say, oh, I see, empiricingly they don't know where Iraq is on the map.

[01:32:11.620 --> 01:32:11.900]
24.

[01:32:12.680 --> 01:32:18.720]
I know for sure that of the 1077 votes, I bet it's at least 20%, couldn't find a rack on the map if you're off into my thigh right now.

[01:32:18.820 --> 01:32:19.400]
What's that at least?

[01:32:20.040 --> 01:32:23.740]
If you had the globe, you know, when your kid, we used to have the globe of the world.

[01:32:23.920 --> 01:32:24.280]
You ever had that?

[01:32:24.480 --> 01:32:24.640]
Sure.

[01:32:25.360 --> 01:32:27.920]
I mean, I didn't have one, you know, but the school gobes.

[01:32:28.140 --> 01:32:28.780]
I've had a few gobes.

[01:32:28.960 --> 01:32:29.540]
But anyway, big.

[01:32:30.340 --> 01:32:30.660]
Some.

[01:32:32.080 --> 01:32:33.960]
Well, when I was saying before, you turned the internet into a magazine.

[01:32:33.960 --> 01:32:35.440]
Finding Iraq is on the map.

[01:32:35.840 --> 01:32:36.760]
Yeah, you couldn't find it.

[01:32:37.880 --> 01:32:39.460]
How about those you event things?

[01:32:39.580 --> 01:32:40.520]
Where's that university mind?

[01:32:40.760 --> 01:32:43.480]
You know, you couldn't find New York City, all these kids from New York.

[01:32:43.540 --> 01:32:44.640]
Oh, we can't find New York City.

[01:32:44.780 --> 01:32:48.660]
Could that be Long Island out there sitting in the, oh, yeah, it could be.

[01:32:49.140 --> 01:32:49.820]
WDQAM, hello.

[01:32:51.460 --> 01:32:52.200]
WDQAM, hello.

[01:32:53.400 --> 01:32:56.580]
Yeah, you really showing me duty for this chick, the way.

[01:32:58.140 --> 01:32:58.840]
WDQAM, hello.

[01:32:59.340 --> 01:33:00.320]
Yeah, I've been showing.

[01:33:01.500 --> 01:33:02.440]
WDQAM, well, we know that.

[01:33:02.700 --> 01:33:03.220]
QAM, hello.

[01:33:04.540 --> 01:33:05.100]
I do.

[01:33:06.060 --> 01:33:06.980]
Okay, bye, sir.

[01:33:07.240 --> 01:33:11.500]
Well, we ought to have that with the book of Brown, but, you know, until the tune of a bitch girl by Hall and Oats.

[01:33:11.840 --> 01:33:12.040]
Yeah.

[01:33:12.260 --> 01:33:13.080]
You're a bitch, Joyce.

[01:33:13.300 --> 01:33:14.280]
Yeah, I can just hear it now.

[01:33:14.320 --> 01:33:14.740]
I have no more.

[01:33:14.820 --> 01:33:15.700]
This is far as I go.

[01:33:15.780 --> 01:33:16.780]
Sure, he's working on it right now.

[01:33:17.100 --> 01:33:18.220]
Is he working on a feverish thing?

[01:33:18.340 --> 01:33:19.120]
And his balls fought too.

[01:33:19.820 --> 01:33:21.540]
I guess it's only the 15th.

[01:33:21.540 --> 01:33:24.860]
Let me remind me toward the end of the month to send him some more money so we can keep his mouth shut.

[01:33:25.040 --> 01:33:26.840]
I mean, I just keep him calm, you know.

[01:33:26.940 --> 01:33:27.100]
Right.

[01:33:28.120 --> 01:33:29.640]
They still need to pay him over here, you know.

[01:33:30.740 --> 01:33:32.200]
You know, there's nothing I can do about it.

[01:33:32.200 --> 01:33:35.060]
You keep playing that on me every single day.

[01:33:35.180 --> 01:33:40.160]
I'm going to ask you this right here on the year, right in the middle of this show.

[01:33:41.200 --> 01:33:44.640]
Do you know anybody who's more generous than I am?

[01:33:44.680 --> 01:33:44.860]
No.

[01:33:45.740 --> 01:33:48.540]
So what do you reply that I'm blaming you for cooking to do so?

[01:33:48.540 --> 01:33:52.700]
No, but it's just because you keep telling me that this is making you a bitch.

[01:33:53.220 --> 01:33:54.160]
Why do you think about it?

[01:33:54.180 --> 01:33:59.600]
I got all these other people out here on my phone, but, but he's on the internet who we're doing all kinds of stuff to make me feel good.

[01:33:59.600 --> 01:34:04.340]
And reach out and give me a little pat on the back of the neck, sometimes like a smack in the head which I could use, which is great.

[01:34:04.820 --> 01:34:09.420]
It makes me feel, and it put me in a pository attitude instead of a negative one.

[01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.240]
It makes me feel loved and, you know, something.

[01:34:12.540 --> 01:34:14.680]
It makes me feel like I'm alive at least, which I need that.

[01:34:15.860 --> 01:34:20.100]
And then you come up with this depressing crap about, oh, the situation still hasn't been...

[01:34:20.100 --> 01:34:21.560]
Oh, what's the only one needed to do about it?

[01:34:21.640 --> 01:34:22.420]
You know, I'll bet out of shape.

[01:34:22.660 --> 01:34:27.300]
Should I go in and lay down on the couch and have a fit and start crying and bawling like a child?

[01:34:27.420 --> 01:34:28.120]
I don't know, it might help.

[01:34:28.440 --> 01:34:29.580]
Oh, can I give it a shot?

[01:34:33.580 --> 01:34:35.600]
How many do that on those days when I have to...

[01:34:35.600 --> 01:34:38.360]
When you come in a little bit late and I haven't listened too much of the morning show?

[01:34:39.920 --> 01:34:41.640]
I think if they invite it, I think I'll be on the table.

[01:34:42.100 --> 01:34:45.180]
And when you told me that toast, remember toast used to work across the street?

[01:34:45.460 --> 01:34:46.060]
When I told you.

[01:34:46.160 --> 01:34:47.520]
I think he's still on the table.

[01:34:47.680 --> 01:34:48.500]
It was Chris that told you.

[01:34:49.060 --> 01:34:51.220]
When you put that square table thing in there, my...

[01:34:51.220 --> 01:34:52.120]
Oh, no, I think that was a...

[01:34:52.120 --> 01:34:56.620]
And one of the questions I heard this morning is I had the level turned down almost in the off position.

[01:34:56.620 --> 01:34:59.180]
Who was your favorite lesbian couple?

[01:35:00.880 --> 01:35:02.860]
Oh, oh, I know the guy's going to call back.

[01:35:02.940 --> 01:35:04.420]
You ought to be ashamed of yourself, Neil.

[01:35:05.240 --> 01:35:05.920]
Oh, and you know what?

[01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:09.020]
You didn't remind me in 19 minutes to my basketball game between the...

[01:35:09.020 --> 01:35:09.880]
Don't worry.

[01:35:10.460 --> 01:35:10.600]
Yeah.

[01:35:11.020 --> 01:35:11.740]
I'll be right on it.

[01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:12.760]
WQA, I'm hello.

[01:35:13.480 --> 01:35:14.680]
Hi, can I speak to Neil?

[01:35:15.120 --> 01:35:15.740]
Speaking, sir.

[01:35:16.320 --> 01:35:19.320]
Brothers grew up in Rochester, New York, where he abused himself by now.

[01:35:19.320 --> 01:35:21.200]
I'm not interested in hearing your baloney again.

[01:35:21.280 --> 01:35:22.000]
Okay, your crap.

[01:35:22.920 --> 01:35:24.680]
This is the Wikipedia guy.

[01:35:24.880 --> 01:35:26.060]
Okay, right in all this garbage.

[01:35:28.540 --> 01:35:29.080]
Crap.

[01:35:30.120 --> 01:35:31.340]
I'm very fond of hobby, though, Paul.

[01:35:31.480 --> 01:35:32.180]
Keep you off the streets.

[01:35:32.820 --> 01:35:33.680]
WQA and hello.

[01:35:34.900 --> 01:35:37.960]
Yeah, Jeff Bush lives in Coral Gables now.

[01:35:38.160 --> 01:35:41.020]
We're looking for golf course.

[01:35:41.480 --> 01:35:41.920]
Phenase?

[01:35:42.740 --> 01:35:43.040]
Yeah.

[01:35:43.660 --> 01:35:44.160]
Phenase, yeah.

[01:35:44.480 --> 01:35:47.020]
And George Wesley in Sparta.

[01:35:48.260 --> 01:35:48.560]
See?

[01:35:51.160 --> 01:35:51.740]
What do you say?

[01:35:51.840 --> 01:35:52.340]
I don't know what he says.

[01:35:52.340 --> 01:35:52.760]
See what he says.

[01:35:52.760 --> 01:35:53.240]
He was sparta.

[01:35:54.120 --> 01:35:55.260]
I guess he lives in Sparta.

[01:35:56.900 --> 01:35:57.540]
5.670560.

[01:35:58.400 --> 01:35:59.540]
I think he's talking about sparticus.

[01:35:59.680 --> 01:36:00.640]
Maybe he thought you were Tony Curtis.

[01:36:00.640 --> 01:36:01.580]
You got you guys confused?

[01:36:01.860 --> 01:36:02.640]
I thought he's pedicus.

[01:36:02.800 --> 01:36:04.360]
I thought you looked a little bit like Tony Curtis.

[01:36:04.640 --> 01:36:05.480]
Get the b*** in.

[01:36:05.620 --> 01:36:06.560]
Get the 4th of GMM.

[01:36:06.720 --> 01:36:07.900]
I'm not really sh**ing right now.

[01:36:08.240 --> 01:36:09.380]
10.83 on a pool.

[01:36:09.460 --> 01:36:10.180]
I'll read the result again.

[01:36:10.260 --> 01:36:11.340]
Maybe one more time during the show.

[01:36:11.760 --> 01:36:12.660]
It's just one of those.

[01:36:12.860 --> 01:36:12.980]
You know.

[01:36:14.780 --> 01:36:15.400]
WQA. I'm Hello.

[01:36:15.540 --> 01:36:16.160]
Yes, I count.

[01:36:17.220 --> 01:36:18.600]
Oh, here's one of my favorite ladies.

[01:36:18.880 --> 01:36:20.800]
This is the only lady caller we get most of the time

[01:36:20.800 --> 01:36:21.440]
and she's recording.

[01:36:21.740 --> 01:36:22.740]
Well, what can you do?

[01:36:23.920 --> 01:36:24.880]
We do get the...

[01:36:24.880 --> 01:36:27.640]
In fact, you know, even the lady factors have been laying down on the job lately.

[01:36:27.740 --> 01:36:28.540]
I don't know what that's all about.

[01:36:28.580 --> 01:36:30.160]
Maybe we're not talking about Johnny Depp enough.

[01:36:30.360 --> 01:36:31.580]
Don't fact in the church.

[01:36:33.900 --> 01:36:34.560]
That's the duty.

[01:36:43.440 --> 01:36:44.920]
My name is Barry.

[01:36:44.920 --> 01:36:47.020]
I sing like a fairy.

[01:36:47.480 --> 01:36:50.000]
I write bad songs about romance.

[01:36:50.260 --> 01:36:53.400]
While I'm wearing stand-ex head, I'm kind of strippy.

[01:36:54.160 --> 01:36:55.580]
My songs are wimpy.

[01:36:56.160 --> 01:36:58.480]
I had a series of big hits.

[01:36:58.740 --> 01:36:59.920]
That was back in 76.

[01:37:00.860 --> 01:37:02.440]
Now no one wants to hear.

[01:37:02.820 --> 01:37:04.820]
They only laugh and sneer.

[01:37:05.020 --> 01:37:05.880]
They won't admit.

[01:37:06.340 --> 01:37:07.160]
They hold my albums.

[01:37:07.640 --> 01:37:08.700]
But my song's out.

[01:37:08.960 --> 01:37:10.820]
We got a nose shake.

[01:37:11.360 --> 01:37:12.440]
Like a banana.

[01:37:12.440 --> 01:37:16.860]
My two fans both live in my turn.

[01:37:17.220 --> 01:37:19.400]
I've got a nose shake.

[01:37:19.440 --> 01:37:21.660]
Like a banana.

[01:37:22.620 --> 01:37:27.640]
Of my nose you keep in half of the city of Atlanta.

[01:37:29.220 --> 01:37:29.840]
Rectum.

[01:37:30.520 --> 01:37:32.160]
I write the song.

[01:37:34.080 --> 01:37:35.960]
Like a banana.

[01:37:38.560 --> 01:37:40.500]
I've got a heart cup.

[01:37:40.500 --> 01:37:42.820]
The size of your purse.

[01:37:43.320 --> 01:37:46.920]
When I get a stop the nose, I be saddened.

[01:37:47.120 --> 01:37:49.360]
I hold it right now on the case.

[01:37:49.760 --> 01:37:51.560]
My life is back in place.

[01:37:51.980 --> 01:37:54.000]
And so I sing again and sing.

[01:37:54.560 --> 01:37:57.660]
My snows in your face got a nose shake.

[01:37:58.020 --> 01:37:59.440]
Like a banana.

[01:38:00.460 --> 01:38:03.720]
My two fans both live in my turn.

[01:38:04.220 --> 01:38:06.200]
I've got a nose shake.

[01:38:06.820 --> 01:38:08.360]
Like a banana.

[01:38:09.420 --> 01:38:14.720]
Of my nose you keep in half of the city of Atlanta.

[01:38:16.180 --> 01:38:16.820]
You're fair.

[01:38:17.300 --> 01:38:19.380]
I write the song.

[01:38:22.280 --> 01:38:25.040]
The first day I was on the air in South Florida.

[01:38:25.360 --> 01:38:26.820]
I was doing weekend's play in the NGFW.

[01:38:27.340 --> 01:38:30.140]
Following Ross Oasis no less than the DJ there.

[01:38:30.820 --> 01:38:31.780]
I played that song.

[01:38:31.960 --> 01:38:32.940]
I write the song from the room.

[01:38:33.240 --> 01:38:35.040]
Is that exciting or what?

[01:38:35.080 --> 01:38:35.800]
What a memory baby.

[01:38:35.880 --> 01:38:36.560]
How many years ago?

[01:38:36.560 --> 01:38:37.620]
I was about 400 years old.

[01:38:38.560 --> 01:38:39.740]
Before Jesus was in infant.

[01:38:40.560 --> 01:38:42.300]
And I was one of the first songs I ever played.

[01:38:42.440 --> 01:38:43.740]
I write the song by very manllow.

[01:38:43.960 --> 01:38:44.660]
I write this song.

[01:38:45.880 --> 01:38:47.460]
What does that mean?

[01:38:48.760 --> 01:38:49.420]
Copic a banana.

[01:38:49.800 --> 01:38:50.500]
Copic a banana.

[01:38:50.660 --> 01:38:51.680]
Well that's not what I played.

[01:38:52.340 --> 01:38:53.340]
I write this song.

[01:38:53.520 --> 01:38:54.460]
I'm going to be a bit of a boo whatever.

[01:38:54.720 --> 01:38:55.520]
Some other fraggy song.

[01:38:55.700 --> 01:38:56.100]
That's what I hear.

[01:38:56.720 --> 01:38:57.160]
That's it.

[01:38:57.280 --> 01:38:58.240]
That's what I'm very manllow.

[01:38:58.380 --> 01:38:58.800]
Hey Barry.

[01:38:59.100 --> 01:38:59.780]
You fair right?

[01:39:00.180 --> 01:39:00.600]
I was married.

[01:39:01.480 --> 01:39:02.000]
Quite contrived.

[01:39:02.900 --> 01:39:03.120]
I was married.

[01:39:04.080 --> 01:39:04.800]
That's authory.

[01:39:05.880 --> 01:39:07.200]
He's still dead by the worst.

[01:39:07.300 --> 01:39:07.800]
Good news.

[01:39:08.580 --> 01:39:08.920]
Excellent.

[01:39:10.080 --> 01:39:11.280]
I've been alive.

[01:39:12.700 --> 01:39:13.260]
Too bad.

[01:39:13.300 --> 01:39:14.140]
Yeah, too long.

[01:39:15.740 --> 01:39:17.120]
That's exactly what came to mind.

[01:39:17.240 --> 01:39:18.400]
I've been alive too long.

[01:39:18.740 --> 01:39:20.140]
We're all the world is singing with you Barry.

[01:39:20.500 --> 01:39:21.660]
You've been alive too long.

[01:39:22.060 --> 01:39:22.080]
Okay?

[01:39:22.380 --> 01:39:23.480]
Just lay down and die.

[01:39:23.840 --> 01:39:24.420]
I know.

[01:39:24.440 --> 01:39:25.260]
Oh that's bad.

[01:39:25.620 --> 01:39:25.980]
That's bad.

[01:39:27.300 --> 01:39:27.700]
Mandy.

[01:39:28.280 --> 01:39:29.340]
I hate to admit this.

[01:39:29.500 --> 01:39:30.740]
I actually like this song a little bit.

[01:39:31.120 --> 01:39:31.860]
I used to like it then.

[01:39:32.180 --> 01:39:33.200]
They played it in the ground.

[01:39:33.400 --> 01:39:34.200]
I know they played it too much.

[01:39:34.200 --> 01:39:35.840]
It's a pretty good song especially for a better.

[01:39:35.840 --> 01:39:37.100]
It would be like her.

[01:39:37.420 --> 01:39:37.500]
It.

[01:39:37.900 --> 01:39:38.160]
She.

[01:39:39.120 --> 01:39:40.320]
You're going to talk to supper what?

[01:39:40.440 --> 01:39:40.580]
No.

[01:39:41.160 --> 01:39:41.900]
I know where it is.

[01:39:42.540 --> 01:39:42.880]
I'll see.

[01:39:43.180 --> 01:39:43.660]
Force me to.

[01:39:43.820 --> 01:39:46.000]
I think I may have gotten a little piece of his beak.

[01:39:47.460 --> 01:39:48.600]
Just enough to wet my beak.

[01:39:48.760 --> 01:39:50.400]
And with Aunt Panucci, he just wanted to wet his beak.

[01:39:50.760 --> 01:39:51.720]
Is there any part of his beak?

[01:39:51.720 --> 01:39:52.580]
He's just a little bit of a chame.

[01:39:52.620 --> 01:39:54.060]
If he wouldn't have messed with that light bulb,

[01:39:54.060 --> 01:39:55.180]
he might still be with us today.

[01:39:55.680 --> 01:39:56.180]
Aunt Panucci.

[01:39:56.780 --> 01:39:58.460]
I wonder if Aunt Panucci had Panucci.

[01:39:59.220 --> 01:40:00.880]
How do I wonder if he knew Louis Palucci?

[01:40:00.880 --> 01:40:00.980]
Aunt Panucci.

[01:40:01.400 --> 01:40:02.200]
Aunt Panucci.

[01:40:02.540 --> 01:40:02.980]
Louis Palucci.

[01:40:06.620 --> 01:40:08.200]
I thought we'd just have to plan this.

[01:40:09.580 --> 01:40:10.540]
Yeah, the real one.

[01:40:10.740 --> 01:40:10.840]
Oh.

[01:40:11.840 --> 01:40:13.040]
W.Q.A.M. Hello.

[01:40:13.640 --> 01:40:14.340]
Neil, good afternoon.

[01:40:14.840 --> 01:40:15.960]
Yes sir, good afternoon sir.

[01:40:16.500 --> 01:40:16.880]
Thank you.

[01:40:17.380 --> 01:40:20.900]
You mentioned No Well Bush earlier and I kind of got me wondering.

[01:40:21.140 --> 01:40:23.140]
Do you think that whenever she was trying to score drugs,

[01:40:23.360 --> 01:40:25.020]
she ever had to do ASTAT?

[01:40:28.640 --> 01:40:30.400]
5.67.05.60.

[01:40:31.920 --> 01:40:32.400]
And 0.560.

[01:40:33.300 --> 01:40:34.960]
And they were rising in singular wireless line.

[01:40:35.480 --> 01:40:36.560]
W.Q.A.M. Hello.

[01:40:38.520 --> 01:40:39.500]
Q.A.M.

[01:40:45.200 --> 01:40:47.400]
Hey let him rastle the papers around a little bit.

[01:40:47.540 --> 01:40:48.480]
They're rastling with their consciousness.

[01:40:48.720 --> 01:40:49.320]
What is it called?

[01:40:50.260 --> 01:40:51.220]
What do you mean this is the call?

[01:40:51.380 --> 01:40:51.740]
This is it.

[01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:53.100]
How do you know this is it?

[01:40:53.200 --> 01:40:53.840]
I'm telling you.

[01:40:53.960 --> 01:40:54.800]
I'll say something.

[01:40:54.920 --> 01:40:55.180]
You'll see.

[01:40:55.300 --> 01:40:55.840]
Say something.

[01:40:55.960 --> 01:40:56.100]
Come on.

[01:40:56.160 --> 01:40:56.680]
You can do it.

[01:40:57.720 --> 01:40:58.040]
Something.

[01:40:58.040 --> 01:40:58.980]
Come on.

[01:40:59.700 --> 01:41:00.400]
Can't do it.

[01:41:00.420 --> 01:41:01.100]
Couldn't say something.

[01:41:01.340 --> 01:41:01.600]
We heard you.

[01:41:01.860 --> 01:41:02.940]
Q.A.M. Hello.

[01:41:03.500 --> 01:41:04.760]
W.Q.A.M. Hello.

[01:41:05.560 --> 01:41:08.920]
Hey let's let all the rising cotton bat boy.

[01:41:12.260 --> 01:41:13.800]
W.Q.A.M. Hello.

[01:41:15.160 --> 01:41:19.140]
I hope I never get hit in the ring.

[01:41:20.140 --> 01:41:21.000]
W.Q.A.M. Hello.

[01:41:21.340 --> 01:41:21.840]
Hey Neil.

[01:41:22.040 --> 01:41:22.700]
Yes sir.

[01:41:22.980 --> 01:41:23.960]
Three quick things buddy.

[01:41:24.440 --> 01:41:27.140]
I'm happy to ask one of us is definitely closed.

[01:41:27.140 --> 01:41:27.640]
Yeah.

[01:41:27.900 --> 01:41:28.340]
OK.

[01:41:28.960 --> 01:41:29.700]
And when you close.

[01:41:29.700 --> 01:41:32.220]
So it's corkies by the way North mind would be definitely closed.

[01:41:32.580 --> 01:41:34.080]
When you play that song.

[01:41:34.980 --> 01:41:34.980]

[01:41:34.980 --> 01:41:35.120]
Yeah.

[01:41:35.240 --> 01:41:37.600]
Are those the airplane wheels getting on the runway?

[01:41:38.180 --> 01:41:38.360]
Yeah.

[01:41:38.620 --> 01:41:39.000]
That's right.

[01:41:39.260 --> 01:41:39.900]
It is right.

[01:41:40.080 --> 01:41:41.080]
Good thing you're in.

[01:41:41.480 --> 01:41:42.220]
You're sharp.

[01:41:42.460 --> 01:41:44.080]
You're sharp as a motzibol talent.

[01:41:44.440 --> 01:41:44.780]
Here we go.

[01:41:45.200 --> 01:41:47.620]
Let's do the entire squeal on the runway.

[01:41:50.080 --> 01:41:50.520]
Eventually.

[01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:54.360]
I mean how long is this going on before we hear the entire squeal?

[01:41:55.560 --> 01:41:56.440]
We heard him as right.

[01:41:56.620 --> 01:41:58.820]
It wasn't the beginning.

[01:42:01.780 --> 01:42:02.580]
There they are.

[01:42:02.700 --> 01:42:02.820]
Yeah.

[01:42:03.340 --> 01:42:03.800]
It's bad.

[01:42:03.960 --> 01:42:04.440]
I stepped on it.

[01:42:04.500 --> 01:42:05.020]
That's really bad.

[01:42:05.240 --> 01:42:09.540]
I promoted a DUI thing for last night and then I stepped on the wheels.

[01:42:10.560 --> 01:42:11.260]
So of course to show you.

[01:42:11.380 --> 01:42:12.460]
But you know what the good news is Chris?

[01:42:12.680 --> 01:42:13.680]
1100 votes on the poll.

[01:42:13.760 --> 01:42:14.500]
All right.

[01:42:15.880 --> 01:42:17.360]
Now we're not going to make it to a 13.

[01:42:17.400 --> 01:42:18.380]
I don't know what you're talking about.

[01:42:18.540 --> 01:42:19.940]
You're hyperventilating these.

[01:42:19.960 --> 01:42:20.300]
You're dreaming.

[01:42:20.600 --> 01:42:21.400]
Like I said, you can do it.

[01:42:21.780 --> 01:42:22.820]
12 plus whatever we can get.

[01:42:22.820 --> 01:42:24.380]
No, no 1300 today.

[01:42:25.240 --> 01:42:26.160]
Stop it a baloney.

[01:42:26.620 --> 01:42:27.360]
WQI am hello.

[01:42:27.680 --> 01:42:29.320]
I shall begin today for a second.

[01:42:30.600 --> 01:42:31.060]
Okay Mike.

[01:42:31.340 --> 01:42:31.940]
Okay, thank you.

[01:42:32.080 --> 01:42:33.040]
Say how to wrestle races.

[01:42:33.240 --> 01:42:33.720]
Look out now.

[01:42:34.260 --> 01:42:34.380]
Okay.

[01:42:35.820 --> 01:42:36.180]
Oh!

[01:42:36.820 --> 01:42:38.200]
Now he's had living a little bit.

[01:42:38.380 --> 01:42:38.760]
All right.

[01:42:39.180 --> 01:42:39.880]
That was the fake bomb.

[01:42:39.980 --> 01:42:40.700]
Blind Michael will tell you.

[01:42:40.700 --> 01:42:41.180]
No, it was not.

[01:42:41.420 --> 01:42:41.920]
No, it was not.

[01:42:42.200 --> 01:42:42.480]
All right.

[01:42:43.700 --> 01:42:45.420]
That was not the fake blind Mike.

[01:42:45.660 --> 01:42:49.220]
That guy named Sam, who does a great blind-mic impersonation.

[01:42:49.460 --> 01:42:49.920]
Are you serious?

[01:42:49.920 --> 01:42:51.760]
The reason that you knew that that was the fake one.

[01:42:51.760 --> 01:42:53.260]
Are you sure it was quick and witty?

[01:42:53.920 --> 01:42:53.980]
Oh.

[01:42:55.380 --> 01:42:57.080]
Didn't sound too quick or witty to me.

[01:42:57.260 --> 01:42:57.280]
Why?

[01:42:57.360 --> 01:42:58.680]
Because he said look out now.

[01:42:59.140 --> 01:43:00.100]
Get out of here.

[01:43:00.220 --> 01:43:00.800]
Get away.

[01:43:01.100 --> 01:43:01.360]
All right.

[01:43:01.520 --> 01:43:02.760]
Where do you come up with this crap?

[01:43:02.820 --> 01:43:03.000]
All right.

[01:43:03.180 --> 01:43:04.240]
He's been calling for years.

[01:43:05.600 --> 01:43:06.660]
We used to work with him.

[01:43:07.100 --> 01:43:08.120]
He used to brag about it.

[01:43:08.380 --> 01:43:08.540]
Sam.

[01:43:09.480 --> 01:43:10.160]
We used to work with him.

[01:43:10.360 --> 01:43:10.360]

[01:43:10.400 --> 01:43:11.200]
A part-time engineer.

[01:43:12.560 --> 01:43:13.480]
And what station I would be?

[01:43:13.480 --> 01:43:13.820]
I would be.

[01:43:13.960 --> 01:43:16.460]
I think he did a little bit of work here too once in a while.

[01:43:17.480 --> 01:43:20.940]
You know, we had a guy named Sam who was a production guy at KAT a hundred years ago.

[01:43:20.940 --> 01:43:22.020]
A guy who's like the guy.

[01:43:22.180 --> 01:43:22.500]
A good guy.

[01:43:23.140 --> 01:43:25.500]
I don't know why he was a good guy, but he just was.

[01:43:25.840 --> 01:43:28.540]
He was the production ace at KAT.

[01:43:28.840 --> 01:43:30.860]
I'm going to go back and get a little bit out of retirement.

[01:43:31.340 --> 01:43:34.620]
Since we're going to head up the new KAT, we're going to get all the old people back.

[01:43:34.740 --> 01:43:36.180]
Ken Katsy Martin back though I think he's dead.

[01:43:36.540 --> 01:43:38.020]
And Arksmith, the engineer, I'm sure he's dead.

[01:43:38.600 --> 01:43:40.040]
People who can get this whore-timer on there.

[01:43:40.940 --> 01:43:42.680]
From the Space Transit Plan to the start.

[01:43:43.300 --> 01:43:43.660]
Gayser.

[01:43:45.120 --> 01:43:45.480]
WQ.

[01:43:45.800 --> 01:43:46.620]
What do you call him?

[01:43:46.940 --> 01:43:46.940]

[01:43:47.380 --> 01:43:48.780]
Uncle Neil, you're a goddess.

[01:43:48.780 --> 01:43:50.420]
Yeah, okay, thanks.

[01:43:50.480 --> 01:43:51.800]
That must have been...

[01:43:51.800 --> 01:43:52.000]
What?

[01:43:52.440 --> 01:43:53.020]
Yeah, the God.

[01:43:53.520 --> 01:43:54.540]
WQ, right, I'm Hello.

[01:43:55.300 --> 01:43:55.940]
Hello, Neil.

[01:43:56.380 --> 01:43:56.720]
Yes, sir.

[01:43:57.500 --> 01:43:59.200]
Is Matthew Hall still in Toronto?

[01:44:00.260 --> 01:44:01.120]
Matthew Hall?

[01:44:02.080 --> 01:44:02.540]
Yeah.

[01:44:02.920 --> 01:44:03.360]
What is that?

[01:44:04.200 --> 01:44:07.760]
I just bought Neil Young live at Matthew Hall, 1971 Toronto.

[01:44:07.840 --> 01:44:08.780]
Oh, I was here on TV.

[01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:10.160]
They probably tore that damn thing though.

[01:44:10.680 --> 01:44:11.280]
Good thing.

[01:44:11.640 --> 01:44:13.220]
Another quick, quick story.

[01:44:13.360 --> 01:44:15.520]
My friend just got a fancy job offer in Manhattan.

[01:44:16.200 --> 01:44:17.900]
And he's living up in the workshers.

[01:44:19.060 --> 01:44:19.420]
Right.

[01:44:21.920 --> 01:44:22.420]
Go ahead.

[01:44:22.580 --> 01:44:26.340]
And I told him whatever you do, don't do what the great Neil Rogers did.

[01:44:26.600 --> 01:44:28.780]
Don't turn down a great job offer in New York.

[01:44:29.240 --> 01:44:30.720]
What job offer did I turn down?

[01:44:31.480 --> 01:44:31.780]
I don't know.

[01:44:31.900 --> 01:44:32.320]
Didn't you...

[01:44:32.320 --> 01:44:33.960]
I thought I already told that story before.

[01:44:34.320 --> 01:44:36.720]
Oh, that was WAV's three different times.

[01:44:36.720 --> 01:44:38.560]
I was Rick Sparrow, who was a big fan of mine.

[01:44:39.100 --> 01:44:39.160]
Yeah.

[01:44:39.480 --> 01:44:40.300]
I hope you did.

[01:44:40.720 --> 01:44:42.860]
You would have been a legend in New York and that would have been cool.

[01:44:43.200 --> 01:44:44.660]
Well, I would have been super cool.

[01:44:44.660 --> 01:44:47.300]
But I might have been talking to some people in the IQ larger than their thumbnails.

[01:44:47.300 --> 01:44:48.840]
So why the hell would you want to do that?

[01:44:50.460 --> 01:44:51.440]
I'm doing okay, man.

[01:44:51.540 --> 01:44:52.640]
I have no regrets I'm doing.

[01:44:52.700 --> 01:44:54.060]
Just fine as wine, you know.

[01:44:54.500 --> 01:44:56.220]
My friend, he's up there in the Berksers.

[01:44:56.380 --> 01:44:56.860]
I said, don't worry.

[01:44:57.260 --> 01:44:59.620]
They'll still be there when you want to return.

[01:44:59.820 --> 01:45:00.260]
Don't turn them.

[01:45:00.340 --> 01:45:00.820]
That's to work.

[01:45:00.860 --> 01:45:01.500]
You're not going nowhere.

[01:45:01.800 --> 01:45:02.340]
Good point.

[01:45:02.460 --> 01:45:03.260]
Okay, good luck to you, Bailey.

[01:45:03.420 --> 01:45:04.120]
Good luck to your buddy there.

[01:45:04.200 --> 01:45:05.060]
Sounds like you can use some.

[01:45:06.520 --> 01:45:08.680]
All these people, if you just go on serious,

[01:45:08.980 --> 01:45:09.660]
if you just go on...

[01:45:10.300 --> 01:45:13.040]
The fact that these people are lunatics and it's a technical disaster

[01:45:13.040 --> 01:45:16.040]
and a joebell and the clearance between the two of them have gotten IQ like you

[01:45:16.040 --> 01:45:16.740]
have size of your thumb.

[01:45:17.160 --> 01:45:18.500]
I mean, yeah, that's annoying.

[01:45:18.640 --> 01:45:19.580]
It's something to bitch about.

[01:45:20.240 --> 01:45:23.280]
But, you know, sometimes in life it's good to have things to bitch about and belly

[01:45:23.280 --> 01:45:24.480]
it can get off your chest.

[01:45:24.480 --> 01:45:35.320]
You know, I'm not a little bit of a Simon.

[01:45:42.560 --> 01:45:43.960]
I'm a little too.

[01:45:44.540 --> 01:45:45.320]
Well, not that little.

[01:45:45.500 --> 01:45:45.540]
Oh.

[01:45:45.800 --> 01:45:47.040]
Love and O7 on the pole though.

[01:45:47.280 --> 01:45:48.940]
Do do do do do do do do do.

[01:45:50.300 --> 01:45:53.440]
Oh, you made me body has a pain on.

[01:45:54.060 --> 01:45:54.460]
I'm not a little bit of a Simon.

[01:45:54.460 --> 01:45:54.460]

[01:45:54.460 --> 01:45:54.460]

[01:45:54.460 --> 01:45:54.460]

[01:45:54.460 --> 01:45:54.460]

[01:45:54.460 --> 01:45:54.460]

[01:45:54.460 --> 01:45:54.460]

[01:45:54.460 --> 01:45:54.460]

[01:45:56.980 --> 01:45:58.260]
Do do do do do do.

[01:45:58.280 --> 01:46:04.440]
Will play your name into the system and send a me of the stage.

[01:46:05.420 --> 01:46:08.260]
Don't even father to question.

[01:46:09.680 --> 01:46:11.560]
Just follow and don't pay.

[01:46:13.920 --> 01:46:18.580]
Everybody's turning classes to us.

[01:46:24.200 --> 01:46:48.560]
We're going to be a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of

[01:47:06.160 --> 01:47:18.540]
a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a

[01:47:18.540 --> 01:47:46.380]
a little bit more on this.

[01:47:51.140 --> 01:47:54.240]
Well, let's see if nickel would say about you, or she's got a great ass.

[01:47:54.960 --> 01:47:56.140]
Like he said about her in summer.

[01:47:56.340 --> 01:47:58.980]
It damn on your hands and knees and lick my boot.

[01:47:59.140 --> 01:47:59.420]
What else has?

[01:48:00.740 --> 01:48:03.340]
1232 or 560 WQM, happy, a Thursday to you.

[01:48:03.400 --> 01:48:05.820]
I cannot believe that I did that thing reading the stupid ass thing.

[01:48:05.920 --> 01:48:06.260]
It said well.

[01:48:06.960 --> 01:48:10.540]
Well, you weren't even paying any attention.

[01:48:10.660 --> 01:48:11.920]
Yeah, but it would have all done that.

[01:48:12.180 --> 01:48:12.820]
Read the wrong day.

[01:48:13.340 --> 01:48:14.120]
Chris never did it.

[01:48:14.300 --> 01:48:15.700]
I'll go a whole radio show doing that.

[01:48:15.860 --> 01:48:16.200]
Not yet.

[01:48:16.740 --> 01:48:17.220]
Not yet.

[01:48:17.220 --> 01:48:18.800]
Oh, hey, hoops.

[01:48:19.840 --> 01:48:20.420]
Oh, and that's right.

[01:48:20.620 --> 01:48:21.020]
1232.

[01:48:21.120 --> 01:48:24.080]
I better turn on the TSM right now, which is owned by ESPN now.

[01:48:24.760 --> 01:48:27.180]
Well, there's a Mohammed Afbar.

[01:48:27.420 --> 01:48:28.220]
Oh, they got motoring 2007.

[01:48:29.020 --> 01:48:29.580]
Oh, it's on the network.

[01:48:29.720 --> 01:48:30.700]
You said it's on CBNS.

[01:48:31.400 --> 01:48:32.820]
Is there a correct there it is?

[01:48:33.080 --> 01:48:34.120]
Objects, loads of online.

[01:48:34.420 --> 01:48:35.660]
You know, plus live.

[01:48:35.920 --> 01:48:37.840]
It's going in steps from each game.

[01:48:38.080 --> 01:48:38.460]
There you go.

[01:48:38.500 --> 01:48:39.380]
You see the delay.

[01:48:39.940 --> 01:48:43.420]
Of course it's delay because, don't know to understand these people are picking up.

[01:48:43.420 --> 01:48:44.640]
You're watching it live on Twitter.

[01:48:44.640 --> 01:48:45.240]
I'm talking about that.

[01:48:45.240 --> 01:48:45.920]
I'm on Twitter channel four.

[01:48:46.180 --> 01:48:49.540]
These people here on my cable on Margers cable are picking it up off the satellite.

[01:48:50.040 --> 01:48:50.920]
And then they're refining it.

[01:48:51.020 --> 01:48:52.760]
And then they're sticking their own spots in there.

[01:48:53.200 --> 01:48:53.920]
Now who's playing here?

[01:48:54.360 --> 01:48:55.380]
Maryland and Davidson.

[01:48:56.280 --> 01:48:57.020]
John Davidson.

[01:48:57.320 --> 01:48:58.380]
Very, very solid job.

[01:49:00.160 --> 01:49:01.020]
18-8.

[01:49:01.100 --> 01:49:02.220]
It looks like a real barn burner.

[01:49:02.320 --> 01:49:04.860]
Maybe it looks like a nippin' tuck or nippin' suds.

[01:49:04.860 --> 01:49:05.520]
Oh, 13-2 way.

[01:49:05.620 --> 01:49:06.180]
Whatever the hell it is.

[01:49:06.420 --> 01:49:07.300]
It's nobody here.

[01:49:07.360 --> 01:49:08.500]
Bar off the curb.

[01:49:09.420 --> 01:49:11.700]
We did a lot of schools, but they promised them playing.

[01:49:11.700 --> 01:49:12.500]
I'm a Davidson.

[01:49:13.100 --> 01:49:13.660]
He's the best.

[01:49:14.020 --> 01:49:15.720]
He does some of the NFL games too.

[01:49:15.840 --> 01:49:16.620]
I cannot stand him.

[01:49:16.620 --> 01:49:18.040]
He sounds like Kenny Elber.

[01:49:18.140 --> 01:49:19.580]
He's got a mouthful of elephant dropping.

[01:49:19.760 --> 01:49:20.280]
Oh my goodness.

[01:49:20.480 --> 01:49:21.240]
Oh my goodness.

[01:49:21.400 --> 01:49:21.640]
This is right.

[01:49:21.900 --> 01:49:22.840]
That's enough of it for me.

[01:49:23.140 --> 01:49:23.760]
That's all I need.

[01:49:25.180 --> 01:49:27.960]
I'd rather watch the leaf-speed Tampa Bay from a couple of nights ago.

[01:49:28.120 --> 01:49:29.940]
Why don't we see that as opposed to this?

[01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:31.100]
Let's get some hockey talk on it.

[01:49:31.100 --> 01:49:31.560]
I appreciate that.

[01:49:31.800 --> 01:49:34.780]
I cater with that much energy and that much skill to put on display every night.

[01:49:35.520 --> 01:49:37.560]
Maybe is kind of losing interest down the stretch.

[01:49:37.560 --> 01:49:39.420]
You're knowing that their fate is already sealed.

[01:49:39.660 --> 01:49:40.980]
But who knows?

[01:49:40.980 --> 01:49:41.540]
Who knows?

[01:49:41.760 --> 01:49:42.040]
That's right.

[01:49:42.160 --> 01:49:42.540]
You tell them.

[01:49:42.600 --> 01:49:43.160]
Brian Duff.

[01:49:43.560 --> 01:49:44.380]
Everybody's named Duff.

[01:49:44.440 --> 01:49:44.880]
Hey Duff.

[01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:45.640]
You're fairy.

[01:49:47.160 --> 01:49:48.400]
11-20 on the dial.

[01:49:48.620 --> 01:49:49.680]
That's a KDK at Pittsburgh.

[01:49:49.680 --> 01:49:50.720]
He's 10-20 on the dial.

[01:49:50.860 --> 01:49:51.080]
Excuse me.

[01:49:51.160 --> 01:49:51.800]
I say 11-20.

[01:49:51.880 --> 01:49:52.500]
I don't know what that is.

[01:49:53.060 --> 01:49:54.460]
5-6-7-05-60.

[01:49:55.280 --> 01:49:56.680]
Pound 5-60 on the horizon.

[01:49:57.040 --> 01:49:59.260]
See, once upon a time, the AM dial was really exciting.

[01:49:59.480 --> 01:50:03.300]
You know, like when I was a kid 600 years ago, before they invented like iPods and stuff.

[01:50:04.200 --> 01:50:08.760]
AM radio was really exciting when there was nothing on FM except a bunch of classical slush and garbage like that.

[01:50:09.200 --> 01:50:10.500]
Everybody had an AM radio.

[01:50:10.680 --> 01:50:12.000]
They had like a little transistor system.

[01:50:12.460 --> 01:50:17.560]
When I was at Michigan State, I had like a little white RCA transistor radio.

[01:50:19.020 --> 01:50:20.080]
And you could drop that thing.

[01:50:20.220 --> 01:50:20.800]
You could smash it.

[01:50:21.040 --> 01:50:23.160]
Because it didn't have any Q.

[01:50:23.580 --> 01:50:26.980]
It was at that point they started making all these transistor-ized cellars.

[01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:28.300]
Now they call it solid state, right?

[01:50:28.580 --> 01:50:28.760]
Right.

[01:50:29.140 --> 01:50:30.680]
They call it rock solid state.

[01:50:31.880 --> 01:50:32.600]
Everybody had those.

[01:50:32.800 --> 01:50:35.160]
Even in East Lansing, they were at Michigan State in my dorm.

[01:50:35.200 --> 01:50:37.980]
We listened to the night to WABC and the WLL Chicago.

[01:50:38.660 --> 01:50:40.880]
And CKL, W, all these other great stations.

[01:50:41.180 --> 01:50:42.820]
Yeah, a night time, it was big 50,000.

[01:50:43.140 --> 01:50:45.480]
And of course in Florida, nobody could hear most of that.

[01:50:45.880 --> 01:50:48.300]
Which is one of the reasons Florida turned into what it is now.

[01:50:48.720 --> 01:50:50.000]
An outdoor septic tank.

[01:50:51.160 --> 01:50:51.780]
WQRM, hello.

[01:50:52.480 --> 01:50:55.220]
Don't ever use Pococo, napkin, to wipe your stuff.

[01:50:57.480 --> 01:50:58.680]
I'll give that a try today.

[01:50:58.840 --> 01:50:59.340]
How do you like that?

[01:51:00.400 --> 01:51:01.980]
I don't know if that's such a good idea getting that.

[01:51:02.080 --> 01:51:02.640]
But why not?

[01:51:02.780 --> 01:51:03.640]
It sounds really good to me.

[01:51:04.740 --> 01:51:06.340]
I was great the first time I'd done it.

[01:51:06.340 --> 01:51:08.480]
But I'd have to get off my fat arson go all the way over there.

[01:51:08.600 --> 01:51:09.740]
It's at least a block and a half.

[01:51:10.200 --> 01:51:10.360]
Ooh.

[01:51:11.020 --> 01:51:11.140]
Yeah.

[01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:12.880]
WQRM, hello.

[01:51:13.680 --> 01:51:14.200]
Yeah, hi.

[01:51:14.800 --> 01:51:16.320]
It's a process on that square.

[01:51:16.500 --> 01:51:17.740]
Yeah, there's a process all right.

[01:51:18.560 --> 01:51:19.140]
WQRM, hello.

[01:51:19.380 --> 01:51:20.800]
It's called putting your neck in the guillotine.

[01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:21.360]
QAM.

[01:51:21.820 --> 01:51:22.180]
Nail.

[01:51:22.800 --> 01:51:24.360]
Long time, long time brother.

[01:51:24.460 --> 01:51:24.760]
I'm right.

[01:51:24.800 --> 01:51:27.220]
Listen, I just want to say a greeting to you.

[01:51:27.520 --> 01:51:28.360]
And I'm going to be late.

[01:51:28.800 --> 01:51:30.020]
Congratulations on your 30s.

[01:51:30.360 --> 01:51:34.100]
And I ran into Rick Levinfall a couple of weeks back.

[01:51:34.100 --> 01:51:36.960]
Wow, Rick Levinfall used to work at Channel 7 right next to him, right?

[01:51:37.060 --> 01:51:41.920]
And he asked if he was still on the dial and he thought that for sure you would have been

[01:51:41.920 --> 01:51:42.540]
required.

[01:51:42.700 --> 01:51:43.860]
That's only still going strong.

[01:51:44.660 --> 01:51:46.000]
But he's still on the dial.

[01:51:46.140 --> 01:51:46.580]
Where is he?

[01:51:47.140 --> 01:51:48.460]
He's up in New York with Teddy.

[01:51:49.740 --> 01:51:50.100]
Teddy.

[01:51:50.760 --> 01:51:51.120]
Teddy.

[01:51:51.300 --> 01:51:51.500]
Teddy.

[01:51:51.700 --> 01:51:52.500]
Teddy, Teddy Daniels.

[01:51:53.480 --> 01:51:54.200]
Penny, Daniels?

[01:51:54.420 --> 01:51:54.800]
You remember?

[01:51:55.280 --> 01:51:55.940]
Yeah, that's right.

[01:51:56.080 --> 01:51:56.720]
I do remember that bitch.

[01:51:56.920 --> 01:51:57.680]
I mean, I remember Penny.

[01:51:57.860 --> 01:51:58.360]
Penny's from heaven.

[01:51:58.940 --> 01:51:59.660]
Penny's from Perkertury.

[01:51:59.780 --> 01:52:00.840]
Okay, well, say how to Rick again.

[01:52:00.940 --> 01:52:01.300]
Thanks a lot.

[01:52:01.380 --> 01:52:01.680]
He's okay.

[01:52:01.680 --> 01:52:02.140]
He's a good guy.

[01:52:02.160 --> 01:52:02.700]
I love this show.

[01:52:04.720 --> 01:52:06.420]
So, I think about all those fakers, man.

[01:52:06.540 --> 01:52:06.920]
Let's see.

[01:52:07.020 --> 01:52:10.260]
If you go to Taco Bell, make sure you check your bag to make sure you got what you ordered.

[01:52:10.680 --> 01:52:12.500]
Oh, when you stop, stop.

[01:52:12.760 --> 01:52:13.540]
This isn't South Florida.

[01:52:13.680 --> 01:52:14.580]
This is Toronto, baby.

[01:52:14.840 --> 01:52:17.580]
This is a real city where we got all these real people working.

[01:52:17.700 --> 01:52:21.040]
You know, people from India and Pakistan and Hong Kong.

[01:52:22.860 --> 01:52:26.780]
It says otherwise you might find a, it says Taco Bell is notorious here in South Florida

[01:52:26.780 --> 01:52:27.720]
for giving you the wrong order.

[01:52:28.160 --> 01:52:30.560]
Otherwise you might find a nasty surprise when you're back when you get home.

[01:52:30.560 --> 01:52:32.680]
Like maybe something with a bunch of mooshy beans in it.

[01:52:32.940 --> 01:52:39.480]
Now, you see what I do is I, I know this requires tremendous, uh, uh, uh, uh, what's the word I'm looking for?

[01:52:41.560 --> 01:52:43.160]
It's a word of attention on your part.

[01:52:43.480 --> 01:52:43.840]
Attentiveness.

[01:52:44.180 --> 01:52:45.000]
That's the word I'm looking for.

[01:52:45.080 --> 01:52:45.260]
Okay.

[01:52:45.980 --> 01:52:48.660]
Is you actually stand there and you watch what they're making.

[01:52:48.700 --> 01:52:49.440]
What they're making you want.

[01:52:49.600 --> 01:52:49.720]
Right.

[01:52:49.840 --> 01:52:53.520]
You keep your eye on it, you know, and you make sure they're not deep into that mooshy bean thing there.

[01:52:53.560 --> 01:52:55.760]
All that, that big vat of mooshy beans.

[01:52:56.440 --> 01:52:57.160]
Oh, man.

[01:52:57.520 --> 01:52:58.940]
How can you people eat that swill?

[01:52:59.480 --> 01:53:01.020]
And what is it they like about it?

[01:53:01.140 --> 01:53:02.880]
Is it, I mean, I don't know.

[01:53:02.880 --> 01:53:04.760]
You know, delicious, but no taste, but bad taste.

[01:53:05.020 --> 01:53:05.340]
Exactly.

[01:53:05.600 --> 01:53:09.060]
Which is like when it's there in the dip, you know, it's like take it or leave it.

[01:53:09.160 --> 01:53:11.860]
I mean, I'll say it was good mooshy and it's like, you know, a chocolate pudding.

[01:53:12.740 --> 01:53:12.920]
Right.

[01:53:13.480 --> 01:53:13.560]
Right.

[01:53:13.960 --> 01:53:14.040]
Yeah.

[01:53:14.040 --> 01:53:18.700]
Or like, nicely, nicely tempered, bite of hog and daos or, um, uh, Ben and Jerry's ice cream.

[01:53:19.660 --> 01:53:20.800]
That's mooshy and it's good.

[01:53:20.860 --> 01:53:22.160]
Like, like, Rocky Road would be good.

[01:53:23.060 --> 01:53:27.440]
Now, maybe instead of going over to Taco Bell, maybe I'll just, uh, mooshy on down to the Eden Center

[01:53:27.440 --> 01:53:30.260]
and go over there to, uh, uh, bastard robins.

[01:53:30.340 --> 01:53:31.600]
Yeah, go eatin' at the Eden Center.

[01:54:14.400 --> 01:54:14.700]

[01:54:17.580 --> 01:54:18.220]
Yeah, it is.

[01:54:18.720 --> 01:54:19.620]
Okay, love your show.

[01:54:19.780 --> 01:54:20.120]
How's everything?

[01:54:20.580 --> 01:54:21.620]
Everything is great, Pellie.

[01:54:21.700 --> 01:54:22.500]

[01:54:22.600 --> 01:54:23.320]
How's things, man?

[01:54:23.880 --> 01:54:24.500]
Everything's good.

[01:54:24.660 --> 01:54:25.520]
How's every little thing?

[01:54:26.040 --> 01:54:30.420]
I'm looking for, uh, and Neil's noise is the, uh, bit Thai Tommy or Thai Tony.

[01:54:30.620 --> 01:54:33.420]
Oh, are you going to do a request now, Thai Tommy?

[01:54:33.700 --> 01:54:34.060]
How old?

[01:54:34.360 --> 01:54:38.500]
I'm Tommy from Thai Tommy, saying for the best Thai food and the best service.

[01:54:38.960 --> 01:54:42.400]
As long as you're not black, come on down to Thai Tommy or South Beach.

[01:54:42.940 --> 01:54:44.060]
We ain't all like black people.

[01:54:44.440 --> 01:54:45.240]
They don't keep well.

[01:54:45.680 --> 01:54:48.020]
Besides, why black people are too eat Thai food anyway?

[01:54:48.480 --> 01:54:50.080]
We're not have fried chicken on the menu.

[01:54:50.680 --> 01:54:51.140]
Oh, wait.

[01:54:51.140 --> 01:54:51.980]
I forget.

[01:54:52.380 --> 01:54:53.680]
We have spare ribs.

[01:54:53.980 --> 01:54:54.900]
You change, I talk.

[01:54:55.240 --> 01:54:56.240]
What's the spare ribs on the menu?

[01:54:56.540 --> 01:54:56.940]
It's a battle.

[01:54:57.760 --> 01:55:00.580]
So, if you're not black, come on down to Thai Tommy.

[01:55:01.260 --> 01:55:02.120]
Come to think of it.

[01:55:02.340 --> 01:55:05.040]
Those damn gay people, we ain't all like them either.

[01:55:05.420 --> 01:55:06.140]
Should they keep food?

[01:55:06.500 --> 01:55:08.360]
But they talk too loud with funny lists.

[01:55:08.680 --> 01:55:09.620]
They stop other customers.

[01:55:09.840 --> 01:55:10.320]
Not come back.

[01:55:10.780 --> 01:55:12.440]
So, no gay, no black.

[01:55:12.940 --> 01:55:16.960]
And while we're at it, ladded people, you make reservations for 715.

[01:55:17.400 --> 01:55:19.360]
Don't show up at 820 and explain your table.

[01:55:19.360 --> 01:55:21.020]
We get to somewhere else already.

[01:55:21.380 --> 01:55:22.860]
Ladded people are always late.

[01:55:23.440 --> 01:55:25.640]
No black, no gay, no ladded in Thai Tommy.

[01:55:26.240 --> 01:55:28.580]
And Jewish people, you stop bickering our bill.

[01:55:28.900 --> 01:55:29.660]
Who cares who have what?

[01:55:29.940 --> 01:55:31.520]
Pay with the angle, set it outside.

[01:55:31.980 --> 01:55:34.300]
Take 45 minutes to try to divide up bill.

[01:55:34.680 --> 01:55:35.740]
We ain't all want you here.

[01:55:36.200 --> 01:55:38.100]

You'll not come back.

[01:55:45.020 --> 01:55:47.520]
No white, no black, no Jew, no Latinos, no gay.

[01:55:47.520 --> 01:55:50.320]
Everybody else for the best Thai food.

[02:02:16.680 --> 02:02:23.520]
Price to dismiss the firing of a US attorneys who failed the White House loyalty test as a legal move because the attorney served at the pleasure of the president

[02:02:24.380 --> 02:02:30.720]
Okay, fair enough. But let's remember that under our system of government George W. Bush serves as president at the pleasure of the American people

[02:02:30.720 --> 02:02:35.500]
And we've got a news flash for you Mr. Bush. We the American people no longer believe you should be serving at our pleasure

[02:02:36.220 --> 02:02:40.240]
So if it's okay for you to sack eight US attorneys because they're no longer serving at your pleasure

[02:02:40.240 --> 02:02:45.300]
Then he'd the call the American people to think it's high time you packed your bags and vacated your temporary residence

[02:02:45.300 --> 02:02:46.860]
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue

[02:02:47.360 --> 02:02:51.680]
You overstay you welcome mr. Bush American voters delivered a strong message last November

[02:02:51.680 --> 02:02:56.620]
We're sick and tired of your lies your corruption and your legal and immoral war that sent so many Americans to their death

[02:02:57.300 --> 02:02:59.720]
It's no longer our pleasure to have you serving as our president

[02:02:59.720 --> 02:03:04.820]
Help for some of us it was never our pleasure to have your line corrupt as the Washington and took these supreme for it to put you

[02:03:04.820 --> 02:03:06.540]
They're actually lost the profit of our nation wide

[02:03:06.980 --> 02:03:11.280]
That alone should a center message most of the Americans who voted nationwide didn't why you to be our president

[02:03:11.280 --> 02:03:13.200]
That means you started out serving without our pleasure

[02:03:13.940 --> 02:03:15.960]
I'm not surprised to sack eight US attorneys

[02:03:15.960 --> 02:03:20.180]
White House documents show you wanted to fire them all but that would have raised all kinds of red flags

[02:03:20.180 --> 02:03:25.400]
So you got rid of those with the gold or prosecuted crooked Republicans for their crimes and hope they wouldn't become a public issue

[02:03:25.400 --> 02:03:26.140]
but it did

[02:03:26.720 --> 02:03:30.020]
Just as so many other examples of your question and elections that emerged to review your

[02:03:30.020 --> 02:03:31.920]
The parable levels of criminal activity

[02:03:31.920 --> 02:03:33.860]
I'm also not surprised that a birdo

[02:03:34.380 --> 02:03:38.840]
General attorney general bird over O5 Gonzalez is in the middle of this latest scandal

[02:03:39.320 --> 02:03:40.660]
Gonzalez will be just another

[02:03:41.420 --> 02:03:43.280]
Ambulance chasing shyster in Texas

[02:03:43.800 --> 02:03:50.320]
If he hadn't proven his loyalty by twisting the law to figure this spot. It ideas on leadership like John Ascroff before him

[02:03:50.320 --> 02:03:55.520]
Gonzalez is a knee-jerk conservative lightweight who puts power above the law and politics about the Constitution

[02:03:56.180 --> 02:04:00.740]
Your actions over the last six years showcase your utter content for the Constitution and the world of the people

[02:04:01.300 --> 02:04:05.220]
You've forgotten that we the people are your boss and your an employee who serves in your position our pleasure

[02:04:05.940 --> 02:04:11.180]
So let's follow the example you said with this missile weight US attorneys mr. President your fire did it

[02:04:11.180 --> 02:04:16.600]
That's what dark Thompson says your fire did it did it is what he says how do you like that? We're gonna send you rise to

[02:04:16.600 --> 02:04:19.020]
Abu Ghar right yeah, maybe the rest of you too

[02:04:20.580 --> 02:04:22.380]
It's really it's just amazing to me

[02:04:23.260 --> 02:04:28.340]
All the crap that's going on and they're still talking American Idol and they're still stories about ending the coal and

[02:04:29.020 --> 02:04:34.060]
Who is the father of the baby and who's the father of America and all of a sudden I think Tom Brady done it

[02:04:34.760 --> 02:04:38.720]
Looks to me like he's he's a man on the mission or maybe in the missionary position

[02:04:38.720 --> 02:04:42.920]
What I don't understand is calling me two weeks later and still being mad

[02:04:43.560 --> 02:04:48.420]
Like it's forts is nothing more than a release mechanism. It's a chance for a few hours

[02:04:49.020 --> 02:04:54.480]
Either in the course of the radio program or and the time you spend in the in the stadium or the arena

[02:04:54.480 --> 02:04:57.420]
To forget about all the other problems. Yeah, forget about it

[02:04:57.420 --> 02:05:01.100]
That's right Bob McCown on the fan 590 in Toronto. He's uh, he's pretty good

[02:05:01.900 --> 02:05:06.760]
He doesn't take it all that seriously see that that's what I like his guys if they're involved in the sports business

[02:05:06.760 --> 02:05:08.620]
That's how they make their living more power to him

[02:05:08.620 --> 02:05:13.860]
But they don't take it all that serious like they realize that it's just like he just got to say a diversion a perversion for whatever

[02:05:13.860 --> 02:05:16.680]
You know go to a game for a couple of hours and like he said

[02:05:16.680 --> 02:05:19.300]
Let's not be talking about it a week later and still be pissed off about it

[02:10:39.340 --> 02:10:40.860]
I think it's what he was saying well you know something

[02:10:41.460 --> 02:10:44.360]
You're going to break to show what an idiot. I was I'm thinking maybe the

[02:10:44.360 --> 02:10:47.380]
With all the publicity I gave him because of that sunset logical today

[02:10:48.580 --> 02:10:53.840]
Maybe they would bring you guys in food then I'm thinking well the guy if the guy that owns the chain is an evangelical

[02:10:54.300 --> 02:10:57.620]
fanatic is you're going to like this show right? He's a godless

[02:10:58.380 --> 02:11:02.080]
Secondary humanist kind of radio show where we tend to that it's all a bunch of crap

[02:11:02.580 --> 02:11:08.400]
All a bunch of baloney. Okay, baloney without the taste and who likes baloney anyway when you come right down to it

[02:11:08.800 --> 02:11:11.380]

But anyway

[02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:16.340]
So I'm thinking that maybe our friends at kfc next source since they do like us

[02:11:16.340 --> 02:11:20.180]
And since it's not owned by a religious nut for instance the curl wasn't some kind of

[02:11:20.180 --> 02:11:24.440]
evangelical lunatic running around he was just spreading the good chicken word. That's all he was doing

[02:11:24.440 --> 02:11:27.840]
The national people that hook us up with the food when that happens

[02:11:28.380 --> 02:11:34.400]
What do we brother? It's not the local manager like the guy across the street may or may not know who the hell we are KFC right

Who might have something to say but have crappy phones and then the four people who actually have something to say

[02:14:42.040 --> 02:14:43.520]
And some people hear from them

[02:14:44.500 --> 02:14:45.820]
WDQ Q.A.M. Hello

[02:14:46.660 --> 02:14:52.200]
Yeah, if so that's just alone was a football player what yeah, what position do you think he would play? Yeah

[02:14:52.880 --> 02:14:58.080]
Sure as I wouldn't be 10 end I'll tell you that and that was this that was the uh socket rocket table yesterday

[02:14:58.080 --> 02:15:00.940]
On Q.A.M. in our morning show with their one seven sure

[02:15:02.120 --> 02:15:06.860]
See anybody can have like a really horrendous month like everybody didn't jenny run the station because we're fading fast

[02:15:06.860 --> 02:15:12.740]
But I mean, you know over that the one seven is over three months, you know, that's a one a two and uh what a two

[02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:17.220]
They can't even if they can't even do the loren's wealth. They can't even get up to the three

[02:15:17.220 --> 02:15:19.180]
You know, I want a two or three and across the street

[02:15:19.180 --> 02:15:23.660]
They can't get up to a three and any day party either. Okay. What does that tell you about sports talk?

[02:15:23.820 --> 02:15:29.260]
Okay about narrow casting and not that I know anything about radio business. I've only been in it for 450 years

[02:15:30.440 --> 02:15:37.540]
On a.m. ad fm and pm and mornings and nights and mid days and you name it and the naked and clothes and everything else

[02:15:37.960 --> 02:15:40.000]
But well, I know about it

[02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:42.940]
So no matter what I tell them they do the opposite that that's the deal

[02:15:42.940 --> 02:15:49.160]
You know, we had that big lunch boost beasley and jolly joebell and Norma Kent and me we had a big lunch and and the soup was great

[02:15:49.860 --> 02:15:51.240]
So you've said yeah

[02:15:51.240 --> 02:15:57.720]
W.A.M. Hello. I've got a lot of material with George

[02:15:57.720 --> 02:16:02.060]
Oh those two are there is two are in the bunk Q.A.M. Hello

[02:16:03.280 --> 02:16:04.920]
Neil yes sir

[02:16:05.500 --> 02:16:08.040]
Um from time to time you play some pretty exciting

[02:16:08.640 --> 02:16:11.140]
Hockey sports announcer bit. Yeah, sure

[02:16:11.140 --> 02:16:14.620]
But I say the the greatest one you have I think is the basketball one

[02:16:15.220 --> 02:16:19.120]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, well they're just going to quarter and the screaming to yourself. Whoa

[02:16:19.120 --> 02:16:21.480]
He did it. The scream at yourself. Okay

[02:16:22.400 --> 02:16:26.120]
Not interested we're not doing requests or we're not doing any sports okay if you're in the sports

[02:16:26.120 --> 02:16:28.300]
You want to see some basketball turn on that horse ball

[02:16:29.020 --> 02:16:34.140]
There you go that's that's are you getting and he got canned anyway. They they railroaded him. Mm-hmm

[02:16:35.140 --> 02:16:38.880]
Dave Helberstem good guy. I think it was an antracimatic thing if he has the undergrad

[02:16:38.880 --> 02:16:41.420]
I think we got to go talk to Pat Raleigh and ask about that

[02:16:41.800 --> 02:16:45.960]
I know this pet ride is getting political the other day. I didn't mention it on the air because it's so stupid

[02:16:45.960 --> 02:16:47.600]
They're asking him about the war, you know

[02:16:47.600 --> 02:16:52.240]
But when you have to start asking guys whose entire lives are involved in in some stupid-ass sport

[02:16:52.240 --> 02:16:57.880]
And you're what you want to get some political aimalization from them that goes to tell me how desperate that it's become

[02:16:58.780 --> 02:17:03.880]
That's America for you. There's that magic that Alberto Vio van Gonzalez again nation's top lawn force

[02:17:03.880 --> 02:17:08.500]
Oh my god. Love it 77 on the pool. We got 1200 like that. So it is 1200 will be fine

[02:17:09.280 --> 02:17:14.140]
I mean when you've been doing this long enough like I have you finally get a you get the hang of it. I mean you get hung

[02:17:15.560 --> 02:17:17.060]
I wish Q.A.M. Hello

[02:17:17.060 --> 02:17:21.700]
Neil do you think the panthers could trade by an Allen for Alexander Ovechkin?

[02:17:23.020 --> 02:17:24.340]
Now you're talking yeah

[02:17:25.860 --> 02:17:31.200]
Okay, Steven women are comedian sitting. That's great. How many Q.A.M. Hello? Hello?

[02:17:32.320 --> 02:17:37.860]
Yes, how are you doing? I'm just coming back in the town. I listen to you when I was living down here

[02:17:37.860 --> 02:17:45.060]
I just wanted to give you a shout out then give you all my support for the Leafs this year since I'm from Edmonton and my team's not gonna make it

[02:17:45.060 --> 02:17:48.180]
Yeah, we're not gonna make it either. I don't think but we're giving it a shot, you know

[02:17:48.180 --> 02:17:49.220]
Yeah, no

[02:17:50.040 --> 02:17:52.440]
Go strong and lead nation and beat the Hurricanes

[02:17:53.460 --> 02:17:58.580]
Okay, thank you. Yeah

[02:18:02.180 --> 02:18:03.800]
Town we in Colorado man

[02:18:03.800 --> 02:18:05.800]
I can barely think of a worse match up than that

[02:18:05.800 --> 02:18:09.580]
I wouldn't want to say if you paid me by the second. I would probably go out and go go to Chick-fil-A first

[02:18:10.460 --> 02:18:14.680]
I'm trying to think I'm wondering is Chick-fil-A do we have it here? I would think so we got all the other major changes

[02:18:14.680 --> 02:18:16.040]
Is that a major chain would you say?

[02:18:17.240 --> 02:18:21.120]
Well considering that they were only in the food courts of malls up and so recently. Yeah, we got no

[02:18:21.120 --> 02:18:23.620]
I'm all plenty of food cards here. I would say no not

[02:18:25.220 --> 02:18:26.660]
No, not not that major

[02:18:27.640 --> 02:18:32.460]
How about minor? Okay, major minor. I see WQA.M. Hello

Is it real? Let me say it again. Yes sir. You said Neil and I said yes sir. When I indicate to you

[02:18:47.140 --> 02:18:49.260]
It's probably me. Yes. That's it again

[02:18:49.260 --> 02:18:55.660]
I was listening last week and you were talking about

[02:18:56.800 --> 02:18:58.300]
Called the daughter wasn't there

[02:19:05.440 --> 02:19:06.240]
All right

[02:19:09.360 --> 02:19:14.240]
Not only are they like I said not only are the colors the usual you know caliper and like old points

[02:19:14.240 --> 02:19:19.600]
But they also the phones they're really good. I'm gonna go to Taco Bell right now. Here's George. All right

[02:19:19.600 --> 02:19:22.540]
Talk about the script over in a commercial. Talk some college hoops

[02:19:23.600 --> 02:19:25.820]
Or just talk about

[02:19:27.900 --> 02:19:28.300]
I

[02:19:29.620 --> 02:19:33.160]
Those time he get to meet the jack walls now you get the hell out of here

[02:19:33.900 --> 02:19:36.040]
You know, it's interesting. They said they were dinner time

[02:19:36.040 --> 02:19:41.080]
I went through that whole rant about the Johnny Fontaine never gets that part and they're they like having a dinner

[02:19:41.080 --> 02:19:46.900]
You know, it's evening knows who he is now Johnny Fontaine will never get that movie. I don't care how many day go getting you

[02:19:46.900 --> 02:19:52.920]
What grease ball gum bars come out of the woodware? I'm German Irish. Well, let me tell you something my crout meck friend

[02:19:52.920 --> 02:19:57.800]
I'm gonna make so much trouble for you. You won't know what else come a lawyer. I have not threatened

[02:19:57.800 --> 02:20:02.260]
I know almost every big lawyer in New York who the hell are you off little boy? No

[02:20:04.480 --> 02:20:05.480]
Goodbye Scooter

[02:20:08.940 --> 02:20:17.000]
You out at secret agents and the field and got them killed like the king or a tree in the school

[02:20:18.700 --> 02:20:20.760]
Can't pick your boy friends in the tunes

[02:20:20.830 --> 02:20:26.890]
You look like the time for flipping I'd like to ask working on the

[02:20:27.790 --> 02:20:32.830]
From your vantage point does Jamie have a mole on his hand

[02:20:34.210 --> 02:20:36.790]
Welcome here we go again

[02:20:36.790 --> 02:20:38.190]
I never knew

[02:20:38.190 --> 02:20:40.990]
Who we find the fiend

[02:20:42.830 --> 02:20:48.370]
We'll never know how many agents died cause of your thing

[02:20:50.910 --> 02:20:54.810]
With the flow back and flow of the joy

[02:20:56.150 --> 02:21:00.330]
When you see yourself that Jamie you can ask him why

[02:21:00.330 --> 02:21:03.530]
All his fame rhymes with Agnew

[02:21:05.170 --> 02:21:11.270]
All good old spirit suspicious spirit lag news baby one 18 at five sixty WQA and we got the mad dog

[02:21:11.270 --> 02:21:16.390]
Coming up at two o'clock then we got the power hour with Hank of the mad dog all that stuff from rivals fourths grill

[02:21:16.390 --> 02:21:18.030]
And we're better than if we do we know where that is?

[02:21:19.570 --> 02:21:25.650]
And then the Humper at the rivals then we got the Panther game and I panthers at seven o'clock and then the panthers in Buffalo at the macarena 730

[02:21:25.650 --> 02:21:28.690]
Sounds like a loss to me and he came from Vegas after the hockey game

[02:21:29.570 --> 02:21:31.690]
Look at that phone all of a sudden went blank

[02:21:32.430 --> 02:21:33.330]
They're all watching the hoop

[02:21:36.210 --> 02:21:39.310]
Are you serious sounds like one of those European soccer games?

[02:21:40.590 --> 02:21:43.350]
See I wouldn't go to a soccer game if you played paid me about a second

[02:21:44.610 --> 02:21:48.910]
And the one of the things that amazes me is is this boring as soccer is altering the match

[02:21:50.070 --> 02:21:53.990]
Yeah people are like there's this constant roar going on to the ground

[02:21:55.090 --> 02:22:01.050]
And you wonder what what is it that they're saying what are they doing? What is all this noise about there's absolutely

[02:22:01.050 --> 02:22:02.190]
No, I guess who the best

[02:22:02.910 --> 02:22:08.270]
What is right now Christiana Ronaldo? So do I have an eye for him or what who Christiana Ronaldo

[02:22:10.130 --> 02:22:12.790]
It's my boy Christiana from my portagacy baby

[02:22:13.790 --> 02:22:18.390]
5 6 7 0 5 C probably don't like the Portuguese if you don't like the Mexicans you don't like the Nicaragua

[02:22:18.390 --> 02:22:18.970]
That's a problem

[02:22:18.970 --> 02:22:23.810]
You shouldn't like the people from the many clever publicana I have no problem with any of those people none of them are gypsies

[02:22:23.810 --> 02:22:26.530]
How about C-Han Durin when you get to the gypsies then I'll have a problem

[02:22:26.530 --> 02:22:29.350]
Are you saying the Mexicans are gypsies that would you know I didn't say that at all

[02:22:29.350 --> 02:22:32.090]
What did you say B? I said they're fine hardworking beaners

[02:22:32.090 --> 02:22:32.730]
Oh

[02:22:35.150 --> 02:22:39.070]
So the bad thing today is the eyes of Martian that else think what am I all?

[02:22:40.210 --> 02:22:40.450]
See

[02:22:41.270 --> 02:22:46.430]
You asked why people call in the talk radio shows says this facts Paul Benziquan at W E E I in Boston

[02:22:46.430 --> 02:22:51.210]
Howard uh not Howard David Howard Miller used to be at W E E I in Boston. He was boring

[02:22:51.630 --> 02:22:54.350]
I used to say that people called in to hear themselves on the radio

[02:22:54.350 --> 02:22:59.250]
Well, there's no question about this and I'm as fact because very often what you'll do if you leave the call on for a little bit

[02:22:59.250 --> 02:23:04.250]
You can hear them turn off the radio and with the delay you know they're turning up lots of they can hear the sound of their own voice on the air

[02:23:04.250 --> 02:23:10.050]
That's what they do man. They're squeezing their kneecaps and anything else they can get their hands on while they hear their own voice on the radio

[02:23:10.050 --> 02:23:16.010]
Which is what they're trying to say is I have no right? Well, I'm on the radio. Oh, I don't like big deal. Okay. I'm on the radio every day

[02:23:16.010 --> 02:23:18.150]
It's other than the paycheck. It's no big deal to me

[02:23:18.650 --> 02:23:19.750]
W.A.M. Hello

[02:23:20.330 --> 02:23:27.670]
Not there. I'm fortunate good line to Q.A.M. Hello. I'm Camille. Yes. Sorry. I'll come start the deskman going back to Amsterdam tomorrow

[02:23:27.670 --> 02:23:28.690]
Oh boy

[02:23:30.930 --> 02:23:35.610]
Camille crude take your seat. It's not freezing over there. I saw the weather last night was like 13 degrees mile looking

[02:23:37.730 --> 02:23:40.130]
13 which is 50 that's 56 Fahrenheit

[02:23:40.570 --> 02:23:44.830]
Listen, you know soccer is the best sport. It's the most important. It's soccer is garbage

[02:23:44.830 --> 02:23:45.350]
Soccer is

[02:23:46.270 --> 02:23:51.030]
It blows man. I want my ass. That's a sport. No, I can't

[02:23:51.030 --> 02:23:52.070]
Okay, great

[02:23:52.790 --> 02:23:54.530]
Good. Good. Get lost

[02:23:55.250 --> 02:23:56.530]
see how the damn rack

[02:23:57.670 --> 02:24:01.290]
Or maybe just see on the rack would be good maybe one of those torture museum there

[02:24:01.290 --> 02:24:04.930]
I'm stood on they got the sex museum in the torture museum right next to the right

[02:24:04.930 --> 02:24:06.550]
I don't have the food museum

[02:24:06.550 --> 02:24:12.670]
Oh, no, I think they do that one place called good luck and believe me you need it to survive it's called good luck

[02:24:13.590 --> 02:24:20.550]
And I finally I took a magic marker and I put it like on the pineapple on a piece of slice of a pizza that they had in the window on the pineapple slices

[02:24:20.550 --> 02:24:23.250]
And every time I go back to Amsterdam I look in the window and it's still there

[02:24:25.050 --> 02:24:29.570]
I understand the hot com that stuff doesn't get mold they put all the plastic they put like macro

[02:24:29.570 --> 02:24:33.750]
No, it's not made of plastic it's for real because once in a while you'll see some poor kid some

[02:24:34.150 --> 02:24:38.370]
Shmendrick tourists come along and go into one of those joints and say oh, I'll have a slice of the pineapple

[02:24:38.370 --> 02:24:41.450]
And they'll go into that pan and they'll take one of those

[02:24:41.450 --> 02:24:44.050]
And they put it in the oven they heat it up baby

[02:24:44.450 --> 02:24:49.090]
Maybe they heat it so hot that it kills all the mung on there. I don't know. I'm not exaggerating. I'm serious

[02:24:50.690 --> 02:24:54.610]
And I guess most of the people there are so fried most of the time that they they don't even know the difference

[02:24:54.610 --> 02:24:56.690]
You know you can even feed them any kind of garbage

[02:24:57.390 --> 02:25:00.030]
Maybe those are dog droppings on all the streets. I don't know

[02:25:01.330 --> 02:25:03.870]
5 6 7 0 5 60 and

[02:25:03.870 --> 02:25:06.850]
Palm 5 60 I can only imagine what the dogs eat there god

[02:25:07.450 --> 02:25:09.190]
Gotta be better than what the humans are eating

[02:25:09.190 --> 02:25:12.970]
70 Q a.m. Hello. Hey Neil how you doing? Okay, sir

[02:25:12.970 --> 02:25:19.110]
I was waiting to radio for a little bit, but you were talking about restaurants before I'm not your restaurant guy that calls once in a while

[02:25:19.110 --> 02:25:24.190]
Works for a fast food magazine. We lost a lot of restaurants here on federal highway flood records

[02:25:25.510 --> 02:25:31.450]
Euston's Denny's you know a lot of it tell me what happened to Houston's I love Houston's mom a lot of these buildings

[02:25:31.450 --> 02:25:37.850]
Sublime they got damaged in the hurricane the guy from Houston's just got tired and they wouldn't repair the building his landlord

[02:25:37.850 --> 02:25:42.410]
So he just packed up and left and that happened to Denny's that happened to flood workers

[02:25:42.950 --> 02:25:48.110]
They got a lot of damage in the hurricane and they and they're just gone the only thing good over here on this side

[02:25:48.110 --> 02:25:50.910]
Now a zone of fresco over there Mexican place on federal

[02:25:51.370 --> 02:25:58.110]
But the problem with flood workers that a lot of these players like that they're getting killed by these 99 sent menus in McDonald's burger king Wendy's

[02:25:58.110 --> 02:26:00.450]
And they can't compete with it

[02:26:00.450 --> 02:26:03.930]
You know who now? I mean what do you want you want cheaper? Do you want good? That's my question

[02:26:03.930 --> 02:26:08.110]
You want something delicious something really succulent or do you want just cheap? You know what?

[02:26:08.150 --> 02:26:10.850]
We got to watch your slippers there. Look at all the money in that time man

[02:26:10.850 --> 02:26:16.650]
I know and the thing about Chick-fil-A it's a very well-respected company because they treat their employees really good

[02:26:16.650 --> 02:26:21.270]
Their turnovers like 50 60 percent. It's usually two to three hundred percent of fast food

[02:26:21.270 --> 02:26:24.070]
And he is a religious guy that's closed on Sundays

[02:26:24.070 --> 02:26:29.350]
But he treats his employees very well and the people that work there like it so and that sense he's pretty good

[02:26:29.350 --> 02:26:33.610]
So it's a good play wonderful to know it's enough to turn my ass around on it. There you go

[02:26:34.230 --> 02:26:39.730]
Pally see one there goes our chick-fil-A all the way maybe like I said maybe they'll send some food over for you guys tomorrow

[02:26:39.730 --> 02:26:43.630]
Maybe and maybe not and maybe they will and maybe somebody else will grab it

[02:26:43.630 --> 02:26:48.930]
Since you're getting the scooter on the Jerry Advises, you know, I mean bokeh camper. He's he's eight feet tall

[02:26:48.930 --> 02:26:52.410]
He weighs about four hundred pounds. What the hell is he need all that to char-hard for anyway, huh?

[02:26:53.210 --> 02:26:59.770]
That big body requires a lot of maintenance. Is that what it is? How about sharing Kimba huh? How about sharing sharing Kimba? Who's that?

[02:27:00.510 --> 02:27:01.630]
Kimba with me Kimba

[02:27:04.370 --> 02:27:06.910]
Boy, those are the days man. Me Kimba

[02:27:07.570 --> 02:27:09.930]
Talk about Abrahamian zombie. Wow

[02:27:10.830 --> 02:27:12.390]
Hey Kimba you're fairy

[02:27:13.110 --> 02:27:17.790]
And now and I was before a dike so really became popular too. I'm not saying that she was but I mean she sure

[02:27:18.310 --> 02:27:19.690]
She sure sounded the party, you know

[02:27:21.370 --> 02:27:25.150]
Just what you want if you're gonna have some chick-on-plane music on FM have somebody inside

[02:27:25.150 --> 02:27:30.330]
And instead of somebody who sounds salt-free and sexy and might you know attract a male audience because they sound like that

[02:27:30.330 --> 02:27:33.130]
Have somebody sounds like an Amazon, you know me Kimba

[02:27:33.950 --> 02:27:39.530]
Sound like she was auditioning for gunga dinner something like that according to toast. She kind of looked like that too

[02:27:40.010 --> 02:27:40.410]
really

[02:27:41.570 --> 02:27:41.930]
I

[02:27:41.930 --> 02:27:42.770]
See there right now

[02:27:43.450 --> 02:27:49.810]
Sitting on Chris's lap. No, but I was talked about either yesterday that day before when I was getting the log in the morning

[02:27:49.810 --> 02:27:54.130]
Let me tell you something about toast. Okay, if there was anybody aptly named in this business. He's it

[02:27:54.870 --> 02:27:58.750]
Because if he's the one responsible for that square round the oblong table crap

[02:27:58.750 --> 02:28:01.770]
He ought to be pilloried right there. Whatever that means. He ought to be hilloried

[02:28:02.530 --> 02:28:06.530]
That'll take him out there and hang his ass from the fly pull right over there a KFC across the street

[02:28:06.530 --> 02:28:07.970]
Then you can get your freaking chicken

[02:28:10.790 --> 02:28:14.910]
See I still think you see this is what tells me about your belly hard away all these people

[02:28:14.910 --> 02:28:20.450]
They used to work across the street at the ticket, okay, and that was gonna be the big in they were gonna get all the inside dope and all the inside

[02:28:20.450 --> 02:28:22.230]
secrets, huh? You know and then now

[02:28:22.690 --> 02:28:26.770]
You know we got the numbers they used to have most of the day and they got the numbers we had when you put them together

[02:28:26.770 --> 02:28:32.190]
You still don't have a good number and believe me. I know a good number when I see one trust me when I tell you hmm

[02:28:34.810 --> 02:28:36.450]
25 past one at QAM

[02:28:36.450 --> 02:28:38.750]
Hey, yeah, there's there's no point in even be moaning that fact

[02:28:38.750 --> 02:28:43.250]
Because like you say as long as we keep talking sports. Why should anybody care about that?

[02:28:43.370 --> 02:28:48.070]
Like the other day when we the yesterday when we had not only the Marlin exhibitionist game on in the afternoon

[02:28:48.070 --> 02:28:54.050]
But if that didn't put you out like a like a light then the u.m. My baseball game with Rutgers last night ought to do it

[02:28:54.490 --> 02:28:56.450]
If we can't finish you off in the afternoon

[02:28:56.450 --> 02:28:59.790]
Well, at least puts you in a coma bite no later than eight or nine believe me

[02:29:00.530 --> 02:29:03.690]
Which in South Florida to be a pubic service shouldn't it should be

[02:29:04.830 --> 02:29:07.670]
I was gonna ask maybe I'll save it for tomorrow because there's this big thing

[02:29:07.670 --> 02:29:10.990]
Yeah, I told you I got a good friend that's going to Chicago for the first time ever on vacation

[02:29:12.690 --> 02:29:18.610]
And I'm reading all there. There's like a big argument about whether you want to get ripped off at the series tower or the John Hancock building

[02:29:18.610 --> 02:29:19.930]
Which is the bigger ripoff, you know?

[02:29:20.170 --> 02:29:22.010]
Yeah, like you know like when they come here

[02:29:22.010 --> 02:29:26.670]
They want to go to see in tower take the elevator all the way to the top and get the panoramic view and all that stuff

[02:29:26.670 --> 02:29:31.590]
You know and what I'm reading online is that they're both gigantic ripoffs that they charge you an arm and a leg

[02:29:31.590 --> 02:29:35.030]
And then they cost you with the elevator and if it's like a couple they you know

[02:29:35.030 --> 02:29:37.690]
They want to take your picture and then when you come back down the elevator

[02:29:37.690 --> 02:29:39.550]
They want to sell it back to you for like 30 bucks

[02:29:40.390 --> 02:29:41.510]
Like that, you know

[02:29:42.610 --> 02:29:46.330]
Well, look at that. There's Papa John's now. I don't know what you've heard through. It's just a spot first

[02:29:46.330 --> 02:29:48.130]
Better be better

[02:29:49.870 --> 02:29:51.230]
Now what do you what's your take?

[02:29:51.430 --> 02:29:57.270]
Too much sauce that put too much sauce on there. It's always wet and drippy otherwise it would be great

[02:29:58.730 --> 02:30:01.130]
Well, I mean it would sit too wet and too drippy man

[02:30:01.130 --> 02:30:01.490]
I don't know

[02:30:01.490 --> 02:30:03.910]
Shit, it's so fast man

[02:30:03.910 --> 02:30:05.790]
If you want to do it, you're on the air

[02:30:05.790 --> 02:30:07.910]
How long will you like 60s?

[02:30:07.970 --> 02:30:09.090]
You A.M.

[02:30:09.390 --> 02:30:10.790]
You've said goodbye

[02:30:11.830 --> 02:30:15.430]
On Maryland 44 David's in 43s, start of the second half

[02:30:15.430 --> 02:30:17.550]
You better get to the tube baby, get ready to lose you

[02:30:17.550 --> 02:30:19.110]
I want you

[02:30:19.110 --> 02:30:20.190]
Get on this park along here

[02:30:21.430 --> 02:30:25.130]
And slip your track with my greasy nose

[02:30:25.130 --> 02:30:49.250]
All right

[02:31:26.990 --> 02:31:28.110]
You fairly know

[02:31:28.110 --> 02:31:29.910]
The shots close weekend

[02:31:31.230 --> 02:31:31.590]
Huh

[02:31:32.430 --> 02:31:33.990]
132 at 56, you W2A

[02:31:33.990 --> 02:31:38.050]
I'm all looking at it. It's good. Maybe it's good from it's a three-pointer. It looks like to me. I'm right

[02:31:38.510 --> 02:31:43.610]
Of course, I'm not paying any attention. This is all clips from the first half. Anyway, I'm sure isn't it sure it is crisp? What?

[02:31:44.750 --> 02:31:46.690]
Exactly. Now who do you like the wildcats of the torps?

[02:31:47.530 --> 02:31:50.230]
I want with the terps the torps. Yes

[02:31:51.150 --> 02:31:53.630]
You can now use the futures market to bid on hurricanes

[02:31:55.130 --> 02:31:59.990]
Not the hurricanes, but just on hurricanes in general. Speaking about that guy said before that was kind of interesting

[02:32:00.570 --> 02:32:03.770]
See this is what happens when you live in a place where there's hurricanes all over the place

[02:32:03.770 --> 02:32:07.530]
And everything keeps getting blown to pieces and people just finally say the hell with this already

[02:32:07.530 --> 02:32:09.950]
The hell with it already. That's what they say

[02:32:10.490 --> 02:32:14.290]
And they shut the doors because Houston's there on federal highway. There was like legendary

[02:32:14.930 --> 02:32:19.930]
Didn't you love Houston's? I always used to read about the great soups they had and a honey mustard dressing on a shallows and stuff

[02:32:19.930 --> 02:32:22.030]
I liked it the one time I went there. So it's great.

[02:32:22.710 --> 02:32:23.070]
gone

[02:32:24.090 --> 02:32:27.150]
Starting yesterday and I'm sorry. No starting Monday

[02:32:28.250 --> 02:32:33.970]
What's all day is it starting Monday that Chicago Mercontale Exchange began offering contracts covering the rival of the first

[02:32:33.970 --> 02:32:38.510]
Be Hurricanes in Florida and for other coastal regions during the 2007 hurricane season

[02:32:38.510 --> 02:32:45.150]
These contracts which are on extensive the CMEs existing whether contract market provide insurance firms oil companies

[02:32:45.150 --> 02:32:49.410]
Utilities and others an opportunity to cover risks not predicted by traditional insurance policies

[02:32:50.230 --> 02:32:55.370]
A contract essentially works like this after storm begins forming off the coast of Africa for example

[02:32:55.370 --> 02:32:59.050]
A buyer can obtain a contract covering the first storm to make landfall in Florida

[02:32:59.670 --> 02:33:03.810]
The risk level of the storm would be determined by sliding scale the CME

[02:33:03.810 --> 02:33:08.990]
Carve a hurricane index that takes into account the size of the hurricane maximum wind velocity and damage potential

[02:33:08.990 --> 02:33:12.530]
The scale starts at zero and rises the storm becomes larger and more powerful

[02:33:13.250 --> 02:33:16.190]
If the storm approaches any part of Florida becomes a higher category

[02:33:16.190 --> 02:33:17.450]
Hurricanes the index rises

[02:33:17.450 --> 02:33:21.490]
This is a contract purchased when the index was at two for example at two grand

[02:33:22.030 --> 02:33:24.630]
Could be worth 10 grand when the index rises to 10

[02:33:25.770 --> 02:33:31.210]
So the more and obviously the more we want the hurricane to be gigantic and cause a tremendous amount of damage just to somebody else

[02:33:32.590 --> 02:33:39.050]
The futures owner can hold on to the contract to 10 grand or sell for a higher price if the risk increases if it becomes a category 7,000

[02:33:40.250 --> 02:33:41.710]
If it becomes the big blow

[02:33:42.370 --> 02:33:47.370]
If the contract is worth 10 grand on the hurricane strike floor to the hold it can obtain 10,000 dollars cancer than a few days

[02:33:47.370 --> 02:33:51.370]
This compares to traditional insurance policies or claims may not be settled for months

[02:33:51.930 --> 02:33:54.330]
It's like going right to go into the track. It's like going to woodbind

[02:33:54.330 --> 02:33:57.150]
Only actually something comes out of this machine I guess maybe

[02:33:57.970 --> 02:34:04.810]
But if hurricane does not strike land in Florida during the 2007 season of contract whether it costs two grand or ten grand or more is worthless

[02:34:05.310 --> 02:34:05.710]
worthless

[02:34:05.710 --> 02:34:08.650]
Just like our sales department worthless

[02:34:08.650 --> 02:34:11.490]
Hurricane season runs from June 1 through November 30

[02:34:12.450 --> 02:34:15.410]
As the I-Tamarts study by the way case you haven't noticed

[02:34:16.490 --> 02:34:21.470]
And following the devastating 2005 hurricane season that caused an estimated 79 billion dollars in damage

[02:34:21.470 --> 02:34:28.210]
It became apparent there was a limited capacity to ensure customer claims said CME alternative investment products director Felix Carbeo

[02:34:28.710 --> 02:34:32.570]
With these hurricane contracts ensures others will be able to transfer their risk to the capital markets

[02:34:32.570 --> 02:34:36.990]
And thereby increase their capacity to ensure customers but a bit better move about so when you want to bet bigger

[02:34:36.990 --> 02:34:37.870]
Hurricane small hurricane

[02:34:37.870 --> 02:34:42.830]
1 category 10 category 4 million category 83 whatever

[02:34:43.970 --> 02:34:46.910]
Maryland 44 and Davidson 49

[02:34:48.850 --> 02:34:54.550]
Wow, who now is Davidson anybody who the hell they are I don't rank number 13 Maryland's rank number four

[02:34:55.390 --> 02:35:01.570]
Nice free throw baby. There we go 50 David. Let's root for who's now obviously Maryland's the favorite the rate number four right the twerps

[02:35:02.810 --> 02:35:06.690]
Correct and they're getting their ass kicked by six cruisers 1805 to go in a second half

[02:35:06.690 --> 02:35:09.110]
Oh, what a do you see that he threw up a rock?

[02:35:09.350 --> 02:35:09.550]
Carble

[02:35:10.170 --> 02:35:12.290]
He threw up a rock he threw up a stone

[02:35:13.090 --> 02:35:15.410]
He must be stoned off his ass that guy

[02:35:15.990 --> 02:35:20.490]
Now let's see Davidson's got four out of the five guys are white guys

[02:35:21.930 --> 02:35:25.230]
That's only a two-pointer and he may be oh geez not good not good

[02:35:26.890 --> 02:35:29.250]
So anyway, anybody wants to see this crap. It's on television

[02:35:29.250 --> 02:35:32.610]
I'm going back to a hockey or something. This is so boring. I

[02:35:32.610 --> 02:35:36.510]
Used to like basketball once upon a time before almost all the players are bunch of seven-foot tall freaks

[02:35:37.150 --> 02:35:40.790]
All that slang with jammer crap. Yeah, slang this slay. I'm in here for jammer

[02:35:41.790 --> 02:35:43.170]
Let's see if there's any hockey stuff

[02:35:46.070 --> 02:35:51.410]
This is still at Calgary, Calilato. Oh boy. What a match up that is. I just enough to put you into a terminal coma

[02:35:51.410 --> 02:35:53.110]
It's enough to put you into a Terry Shiboh

[02:35:54.310 --> 02:35:56.570]
5 6 7 0 5 60 the phone again

[02:35:56.570 --> 02:36:01.770]
Dead is a door nail man. Just when we thought that things were really starting to pick up this week. We're on fire

[02:36:02.130 --> 02:36:03.270]
Uh-huh flamin

[02:36:03.630 --> 02:36:07.110]
Some might say and then you start talking about that char and chick filet stuff

[02:36:07.110 --> 02:36:09.470]
It's just with regards to the fudruckers. It was okay

[02:36:09.470 --> 02:36:12.630]
But for my money the best burger you can get around here is char hut

[02:36:12.970 --> 02:36:17.210]
Well, we won't argue with that since there were fine sponsors and since and like I told you I used to go there all the time

[02:36:17.770 --> 02:36:20.010]
That one in temerak on the way home from the pill doctor

[02:36:20.870 --> 02:36:24.690]
Definitely worth the price compared to the burger chain. See this business is about worth the price

[02:36:24.690 --> 02:36:27.590]
I mean, how much are we really talking about here? Okay?

[02:36:28.070 --> 02:36:30.670]
I'm not so it's as Papa John's is too doy

[02:36:31.330 --> 02:36:34.190]
Sausage to wet and too much and too doy

[02:36:34.750 --> 02:36:36.650]
Maybe talking about the price again

[02:36:37.890 --> 02:36:42.250]
No, you see one thing about it like in Italy the Italian people love their food as you know

[02:36:42.250 --> 02:36:45.250]
They're big in the food and so they will spend a

[02:36:45.810 --> 02:36:51.070]
Inordinate amount of this proportion of amount of money on food because it's important to them. More important thing

[02:36:51.630 --> 02:36:53.370]
I'm sorry. That's the wrong language. Well, whatever

[02:36:53.370 --> 02:36:57.290]
You know what I'm saying what he saying? I'm saying that Americans just want cheap

[02:36:57.290 --> 02:37:01.250]
They don't want quality they want cheap like the guy said little one to go to fast food expert

[02:37:01.250 --> 02:37:03.690]
That's why fuckers went down the drain one of the reasons

[02:37:04.190 --> 02:37:07.150]
They couldn't compete with a little little little squirrely burgers

[02:37:07.150 --> 02:37:10.870]
And in fact, I'm surprised there aren't like crystals all over town if that's the case

[02:37:11.450 --> 02:37:15.970]
You know, he fell off the whole uh truck for about three bucks. I'll take 700 of those crystal

[02:37:15.970 --> 02:37:18.070]
You know bacon whatever those things are

[02:37:19.470 --> 02:37:23.230]
1210 on the post like greens in the Detroit years ago greens and top hat

[02:37:23.950 --> 02:37:29.650]
We used to have top hat hamburgers the same thing you drive through with a little greasy burgers a little tiny ones on the big puffy buns, you know

[02:37:29.650 --> 02:37:30.930]
Mm-hmm

[02:37:30.930 --> 02:37:34.810]
And the meat the meat let it's like mystery meat. You know it's a size of your thumb

[02:37:38.390 --> 02:37:45.190]
I long for the days baby. I long for those days here. He goes again living in the past that old meal that ancient old troll

[02:37:46.110 --> 02:37:48.330]
When you go into like a like looking at in a

[02:37:48.770 --> 02:37:53.090]
How many times have we talked about it like that place on red road? What is it red and bird that um

[02:37:53.090 --> 02:37:54.350]
Drugs to her hellons

[02:37:54.350 --> 02:37:57.550]
Allons very good excellent job George Allen's drugs, baby

[02:37:57.550 --> 02:38:00.510]
Where they have the old-fashioned fountain and you sit down

[02:38:00.510 --> 02:38:03.790]
And you watch and make the burger the big thick juicy burger right there on the grill

[02:38:03.790 --> 02:38:06.170]
And then they put the cheese on there and they put the little uh

[02:38:06.170 --> 02:38:12.050]
The cover over the top and melt that cheese on there and you give me a nice fresh real burger made with real ground beef

[02:38:12.050 --> 02:38:19.150]
Baby now do they have a soda jerk and they got a soda jerk jerk idiotic jerk then I'm sure they do and you watch and make like a real

[02:38:19.150 --> 02:38:20.790]
Multid oh god

[02:38:22.470 --> 02:38:27.530]
Something for real is opposed to pre-fabricated stuff that comes out of a gigantic box somewhere, you know

[02:38:27.530 --> 02:38:30.430]
And so one thing I will say about the fast food joints and this is the truth

[02:38:31.850 --> 02:38:37.350]
Whether it's in Amsterdam whether it's in Berlin whether it's in a roll-mount where they have all that great food and anybody

[02:38:37.350 --> 02:38:39.870]
Weets in McDonald's ought to be shot in Rome, but anyway they do

[02:38:40.630 --> 02:38:44.290]
No matter where you miss all the same. That's one thing that they do guarantee it's all consistent

[02:38:44.290 --> 02:38:47.890]
But they send it in these gigantic cartons. I have no idea where they you know

[02:38:48.650 --> 02:38:49.990]
Where they're killing the uh

[02:38:49.990 --> 02:38:55.470]
Anemules or whatever, but it's all exactly the same if you got a cheeseburger at a fast food joint at burger King

[02:38:55.470 --> 02:39:00.110]
Or McDonald's in Berlin and we'll taste exactly the same as when you get in next to the sawgrass

[02:39:01.390 --> 02:39:01.950]
All right

[02:39:02.650 --> 02:39:03.010]
Well

[02:39:03.710 --> 02:39:05.430]
At least it's consistent like yeah

[02:39:05.990 --> 02:39:08.810]
At least it's edible at least you know up to expect in Amistadam

[02:39:08.810 --> 02:39:12.290]
Just because everybody's stone can't we have like a little real food in here, huh?

[02:39:12.570 --> 02:39:15.410]
And of course, they're very special is pea soup is one of them oh

[02:39:16.470 --> 02:39:20.610]
Peas and french fries with mayonnaise and that brown mystery sauce

[02:39:24.590 --> 02:39:26.790]
Playoff what's all of that put the impecking

[02:39:27.430 --> 02:39:30.830]

[02:39:38.230 --> 02:39:39.110]
Move

[02:39:39.110 --> 02:39:43.590]
The name of the game is the Bible

[02:39:43.590 --> 02:39:44.370]

Invite them to your house

[02:39:54.030 --> 02:39:55.750]
Make their possessions away

[02:39:57.630 --> 02:39:59.410]
And then you burn it down

[02:40:02.150 --> 02:40:05.090]
You can get somebody to believe in

[02:40:05.630 --> 02:40:08.350]
If you make the Bible say it's true

[02:40:09.630 --> 02:40:11.970]
No matter what you do you can be

[02:40:11.970 --> 02:40:17.350]
Of the Lord will always forgive you pick up the poison it's made

[02:40:18.030 --> 02:40:18.850]

[02:49:50.530 --> 02:49:54.790]
Which is all the sports talk we had it was more than enough and I had no idea was I was talking about by the way

[02:49:54.790 --> 02:49:59.110]
And what seven eight was the CBS mystery theater was giving our reprieve to get my brains unscathlete

[02:49:59.110 --> 02:50:01.590]
And then eight to midnight was like regular topical talk, you know

[02:50:02.190 --> 02:50:06.710]
Like talking about you know blueberry animals and stuff like that and Andre Baruchin B. Wayne swimming across

[02:50:06.710 --> 02:50:08.390]
Lake worth over there in Palm Beach

[02:50:09.290 --> 02:50:10.670]
So that station across the

[02:50:11.290 --> 02:50:14.230]
Lake there that you couldn't hear it at night you could see the tower

[02:50:14.230 --> 02:50:17.970]
But you couldn't hear it. It was like driving in to Detroit from the west

[02:50:17.970 --> 02:50:22.590]
I'm right talking about Keener 13 at night time. They're single- but so do Russian and you could see their 85 towers

[02:50:22.590 --> 02:50:25.970]
But you couldn't hear the station as soon as you drive by all the towers and wow

[02:50:25.970 --> 02:50:28.970]
I just got real out of your radio. You know just about blow out your speakers

[02:50:30.030 --> 02:50:34.790]
Those are the days baby when a radio was almost worth owning James Cameron presents

[02:50:35.370 --> 02:50:37.230]
Jesus Christ in my

[02:50:37.230 --> 02:50:38.730]
One son

[02:50:39.370 --> 02:50:42.570]
Starring Jesus Christ Mary Magdalene

[02:50:42.570 --> 02:50:47.190]
Judah and Pontius Pilate as Uncle Charlie
