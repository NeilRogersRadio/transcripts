[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.180]
Daniel God.

[00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:08.300]
Now, 560 W. U.A. presents the Q.A. M. Road Group.

[00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.180]
Not a 60-foot leap here.

[00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.060]
Here's people and the Q.A. M. Road Group.

[00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.540]
I'm sorry I can't get to your goals right now.

[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.680]
I'm a little busy picking up this trash here and the sight of the road.

[00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.420]
You talking to D.F.O.?

[00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.480]
Just maintaining a little dignity here.

[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.180]
Chuck, that's what everybody loves about U.D.F.O.

[00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.860]
Start looking busy, here comes the screw with.

[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:44.180]
Hey, we ain't running as social club here. Get back to work, get back to work.

[00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:45.700]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

[00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.340]
Keep maintaining a little dignity here.

[00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.040]
Chuck, that's what everybody loves about U.D.F.O.

[00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.740]
Start looking busy, here comes the screw with.

[00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:01.060]
Hey, we ain't running as social club here. Get back to work, get back to work.

[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.040]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.020]
You missed the candy wrap over here.

[00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:06.740]
No, shut up, really?

[00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.680]
What are you doing standing around for, oh, he's quake.

[00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:10.660]
I am what you are.

[00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.920]
I get tired, you like bits, don't you?

[00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.640]
I'm sure you do.

[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.380]
Grab that hammer and break those rocks to fit.

[00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.120]
Stop breaking, stop breaking.

[00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.000]
Do, D.F.O.

[00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:22.260]
Yeah.

[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.560]
Pick up that diaper.

[00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.160]
It's got duty in it.

[00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:25.560]
Get off.

[00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.040]
But I am doing what?

[00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:34.440]
You know, it seems what we have here is a failure to communicate.

[00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:36.180]
I know I saw that too.

[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:37.160]
Listen up, D.F.O.

[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:43.100]
Listen up, yesterday you may have been a big shot, but today you're my bitch.

[00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:44.640]
Now look down the road.

[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.580]
Now look down the road.

[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.440]
See any cars coming?

[00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.840]
No.

[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.580]
You're a big sports fan, right?

[00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:51.520]
Oh, you know, I...

[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.780]
Good.

[00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.860]
Good.

[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.360]
Good.

[00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.020]
Never think so.

[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.900]
Okay.

[00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.760]
Hurry, fast, fast, come on, fast.

[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.920]
Yeah.

[00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.840]
Yeah.

[00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.320]
Yeah.

[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:02.640]

[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.960]
10, 19, and 5, 60, W.

[00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.060]
So this is shocking.

[00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.380]
Did you read this that Bob Norman wrote in the summary?

[00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:09.540]
Yes, that's every word of it, yes.

[00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:11.300]
Somebody faxed us in the daily pulp.

[00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.800]
Say it ain't so, Joe, is the headline.

[00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:21.380]
On the year Wednesday morning, meaning last Wednesday, NBC6 Sports anchor in Dolphins color commentator Joe Rose commented on.

[00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:22.140]
Color.

[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.460]
And what he said wasn't pretty, right Bob Norman?

[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:36.340]
When a color mentioned something about the difference between light skinned and darker skinned black women on Rose's Morning Drive radio show on 790 The Ticket, Rose Entoned, that's an interesting choice of words, isn't it?

[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:43.940]
Rose Entoned, that he preferred lighter skinned black women whom he termed red bones than darker skinned black women or chocolates.

[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.180]
And then he added that it's his understanding that most black men feel the same way.

[00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:56.420]
Now this is breaking as I write this Bob Norman says the cruel gables attorney Jack Thompson who gained national fame fighting up Senator Howard Skurren.

[00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:02.180]
This contacted the NAACP about the comments and Howard Times reported Elgin Jones is digging the matter.

[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.360]
He went and said, Joe, how red bones are more attractive than darker women said Bob.

[00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:10.360]
You know those words could be very stupid and hurtful and double like this is unacceptable.

[00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.860]
Absolutely.

[00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.980]
I think if you often don't gain high school, you know about it often.

[00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.740]
And then he would do something about it on the radio.

[00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.960]
So I don't offer any rewit Thompson ever question Mark.

[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.040]
But this is an instance where I do sit Bob.

[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.080]
We mark so far based on the memory of those who heard the note taken surface.

[00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:30.080]
Joe is requested to grab him from the radio station as well as the camera room station managers and students who are nothing back in time as this morning.

[00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.360]
Born this later on the sure rights Bob Norman and he groward New Times magazine.

[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.060]
I've never heard that term before in my life.

[00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.780]
Well I've tried to just group here.

[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:43.800]
I've heard the new circle.

[00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.080]
Jones is requested to copy from the radio station.

[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.980]
Are you going to get started now?

[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.740]
I don't want to like that.

[00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:48.240]
I don't know.

[00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.400]
Have you tried to keep our nose clean?

[00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:51.280]
More arrested as two.

[00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.760]
You know, right?

[00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.060]
So let's just dance on the grave from the sidelines.

[00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:59.460]
Better than I've never heard that term before.

[00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.620]
And it's about time our close personal friend decided to spend less time with me and with us over here.

[00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.220]
And maybe a little bit more time over there.

[00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.460]
Good.

[00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:06.980]
Are you going to get started now?

[00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.640]
I don't want to like that term.

[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.960]
Never do.

[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:09.200]
Let's see.

[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.140]
Here's the facts already.

[00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.360]
Boy we are waiting to see these bones today.

[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:13.000]
Q I M.

[00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:13.780]
Hi, guys.

[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:14.280]
Yeah, huh.

[00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:15.780]
Good morning, Neil and Jordan.

[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.920]
It says just out of curiosity.

[00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:18.860]
Who is the original first team anyway?

[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.120]
The situation is about time our close personal friend says if you go on the cavemancree.com.

[00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.800]
You can scroll the Pistach K-Mans department.

[00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:26.920]
It's my partner who isn't a music from the commercials.

[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.220]
Well that's wonderful.

[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:29.560]
That is what I really wanted.

[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.960]
Just out of curiosity.

[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.920]
Who is the one that Michael said in Y5-3.

[00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:34.860]

We need to do something about those glasses too.

We need to do something about those glasses too.

[00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:04.020]
Here's a fact that says somebody is going to be really chronic.

[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:06.340]
Somebody in Monroe County, no less, somebody in the keys.

[00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:07.480]
Somebody in the keys.

[00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:09.120]
Says, Neil heard the rose thing last week.

[00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:12.120]
He was just saying he preferred red bones over darker women.

[00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:12.480]
He was just saying he preferred red bones over darker women.

[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:12.480]

[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:12.480]

[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:14.280]
I prefer blondes with big boobs, so what?

[00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:14.600]

[00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:14.600]

[00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:17.240]
I also said he finds most black athletes, not black men.

[00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:17.240]

[00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:17.260]

[00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:20.040]
I prefer red bones over darker men.

[00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:20.040]

[00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:21.120]
Oh, that makes it all better.

[00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:27.240]
All he was doing, all he was saying, give me a piece in a dance.

[00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:29.820]
All he was doing was saying his own preference.

[00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:32.440]
Friggin' writer has got nothing better to do than make something out of nothing.

[00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:35.060]
See, that's why I disagree with whoever wrote this, who doesn't understand.

[00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:37.580]
It wasn't Bob Norman who created the big simmiss about it.

[00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:41.280]
It was the local self-appointed, a hot shot in Coral Gables, who is all over.

[00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:44.320]
He's the local self-appointed, censorist, self-order radio.

[00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:48.600]
Whether it's this show, the Howard Stern show, the Joe Rose show, the Hank Oldberg show,

[00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:49.840]
you pick it, you name it.

[00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:52.420]
He's going to decide what you're going to listen to and what's not being nice,

[00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:54.980]
because obviously, I've got way too much time on his hands.

[00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:57.660]
So, you want to blame Bob Norman Goethe-Hit?

[00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:01.280]
It was the local self-appointed, a hot shot in Coral Gables, who's all over.

[00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:09.840]
Howard Stern show, the Joe Rose show, the Hank Oldberg show, you pick it, you name it.

[00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:12.420]
He's going to decide what you're going to listen to and what's not being nice,

[00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:14.980]
because obviously, I've got way too much time on his hands.

[00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:18.820]
So, you want to blame Bob Norman Goethe-Hit, but I placed the blame more.

[00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:21.020]
I know exactly where it lies, and it's nothing to it.

[00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:26.560]
It's the same. I mean, I've 20 years of this overhead, 20 years, and we just keep going on.

[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:32.220]
Jonathan in plantation, 237 draughtpots, and he must have thought I was kidding about that.

[00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:35.480]
I'm not. That's on our feed that we're trying to, anybody's trying to listen online out there.

[00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:40.600]
We apologize, but, you know, how would you want to start a week out without a Monday morning like this, a QAM, right?

[00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:45.760]
You see, I'm convinced now, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that they just don't care.

[00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:47.380]
You know what I mean?

[00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:47.900]
Yeah.

[00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:54.760]
I mean, I'm not saying that that Jolly Joe Bell is standing there with the window waving the white hankier,

[00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:56.720]
whatever, you know, maybe he was left over from Rick Weaver.

[00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:00.440]
He's waving the white flag at the window.

[00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:01.840]
We just, we surrender, we give up.

[00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:03.560]
I'm not talking about it to the guys across the street.

[00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:05.820]
I'm just talking about in general, we give up.

[00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:06.920]
We give up.

[00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:09.740]
We give, like, you know, little kids playing, you know.

[00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:13.840]
The playing and post the late at the same time on the screen there.

[00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:16.260]
Oh, well, I'm just hope you missed it the first time.

[00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:17.340]
You get through the second time.

[00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:18.640]
I go online right now, man.

[00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:22.480]
And I keep the radio up, too, that we can hear it three times for the price of none.

[00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:24.020]
What?

[00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:26.580]
It's three times as good when you hear me three times.

[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:27.720]
It's three times as good.

[00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:28.900]
It's three times as good.

[00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:29.640]
See, I can do it too.

[00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:33.380]
In fact, what I'm going to do is going to, well, repeat everything three times.

[00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:35.200]
It'll kill two hours in the 60 minutes.

[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:37.100]
Not that I'm counting until I pregame show.

[00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:40.480]
It says, Neil, I put the ad in the trades for you.

[00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:42.680]
I feel free to have the engineering person ever move from the building.

[00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:44.120]
It says Jonathan implantation.

[00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:48.560]
Well, we don't have, see, we have engineers taken out of the building if we had any, but we don't.

[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:51.160]
We got, we got some people passing themselves off.

[00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:53.180]
So who told you that?

[00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:55.060]
That's the pre-delay and the post-delay.

[00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:59.660]
And we actually heard on a court of says laptop.

[00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:01.960]
So, Stefan, everybody else was, check around.

[00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:04.020]
It should be fine now.

[00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:05.860]
So, oh, it should be fine.

[00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:06.700]
Oh, yes.

[00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:08.540]
Oh, we're fine.

[00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:09.740]
Yeah, it's fine on his end.

[00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:11.120]
It sounds like you're not going to believe this.

[00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:13.980]
I mean, George knows because he just thanks this to me.

[00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:15.240]
I cannot believe it.

[00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:19.140]
I got a thing on my, I got an email.

[00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:23.440]
I think it was yesterday from my Brighton High School alumnus.

[00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:25.740]
I think which I didn't go to Brighton High School, but I went to Brighton Elementary.

[00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:27.700]
So somehow I got long time ago.

[00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:28.920]
I got on their website, you know.

[00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:34.880]
Because a lot of the kids that went to elementary school went to Brighton High before I moved away to beautiful Canon dig when the York.

[00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:38.060]
But anyway, so Barbara Sloan said, die suddenly.

[00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:41.700]
And I'm wondering, that can't be the same Barbara Sloan that we knew from Channel 6 fitted.

[00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:42.280]
I hope not.

[00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:44.740]
I don't think so.

[00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:45.140]
I don't know.

[00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:45.720]
You don't know.

[00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:47.880]
No. I mean, I looked in the hairless and sent a lie.

[00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:48.540]
I'm hoping not.

[00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:49.800]
But at any rate.

[00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:52.420]
Dolphan Denny is dead.

[00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:53.260]
Oh!

[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:54.240]
No, that's bad.

[00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:55.060]
Don't be doing that.

[00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:59.520]
It says Dolphan Denny may not have been as lovable as the first Dolphan's mascot.

[00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:00.080]
Flipper.

[00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:00.920]
Oh, Flipper.

[00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:02.920]
I wonder if Luke Calpin was the first Dolphan's mascot.

[00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:05.200]
Oh, if they had told me that, I'd have been a big fan.

[00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:12.340]
But he made plenty of waves in the stands and on the sidelines as he urged Dolphan fans into a frenzy for nearly 34 years.

[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:19.700]
And inspired even had his own drop in on his show, Dolphan Denny, which I'm sure I can find eventually.

[00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:21.960]
Dolphan Denny is a dog.

[00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:22.780]
Ow!

[00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:28.440]
Dolphan Denny, Dennis Sim, died Friday from kidney disease and cancer. He was 72.

[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.420]
Football was his life and his work too, said his wife of eight years.

[00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:35.080]
And his angered Sim from their home in Sarasota. He loved the Dolphans for the very end.

[00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:42.420]
In 66, the Dolphans inaugural season simmitated games wearing rhinestone cover to tire and reexort the fans to cheer.

[00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:48.280]
He was working for Bell South Sim, said of her husband. He had to make the decision to work or do something he loved in football.

[00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:54.040]
A decade later, Timon or Joe Robbie began paying Dolphan Denny an honorable fee to be the team's unofficial mascot.

[00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:55.160]
Yeah, like a few said a game.

[00:14:56.200 --> 00:15:03.700]
Sim retired in 2000, was honored by the Dolphans for 34 years of service. He was given a double V Dodge Ram pickup truck as retirement present.

[00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:06.500]
I didn't know Dolphan Denny had double Vs.

[00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:10.120]
Former Dolphan's president Tim Robbie said Sim was part of the show.

[00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:12.980]
One, your crack enoughles again, it's bad.

[00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:16.420]
Yes, I distraught the George's that Dolphan Denny has bit the dust.

[00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:22.140]
One of the reasons he became a sideline mascot so to speak was he was giving in people's way in the stands dressing up.

[00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:27.060]
And with those big banners, Robbie said to the chuckle, his heart was in it and obviously it was a true diehard fan.

[00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:30.860]
Ingrid Sim said a memorial services plan for Davey though a date hasn't been set yet.

[00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:34.880]
So anyway, Dennis Sim, Dolphan Denny is dead.

[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.120]
237 dropouts, so it stopped there at 237. Let me refresh it again.

[00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:46.360]
Okay, just to make sure that anybody who's trying desperately listen online isn't going through all kinds of psychotic still 237.

[00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:48.360]
That's a good sign, not a bad sign.

[00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:51.600]
Or as noodles would say.

[00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:54.140]
So a good time for the great taste.

[00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:54.740]
If he could.

[00:15:55.360 --> 00:16:01.040]
Neil, this is noodles reminding you that it's always a good time for the great taste.

[00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:05.240]
By the way, if you go to the country kitchen on Sterling Road in Hollywood, you won't see Greg B. Del Waiting tables anymore.

[00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:09.060]
Noodles is taking his place waiting the tables. Greg is washing the dishes back in the kitchen.

[00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:16.860]
A little bit of a come down, but nevertheless, at least that way he doesn't, you know, doesn't have to put on that kind of embarrassing when you've been a big radio star.

[00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:20.540]
And he never was a big radio star, just that all the people who were used to write about radio.

[00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:23.120]
Remember those days when we had people in newspapers who would write about radio?

[00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:23.480]
No.

[00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:26.440]
Well, yeah, it's long ago, maybe four years ago.

[00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:29.540]
But they were enchanted with Greg B. Del for whatever reason.

[00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:30.500]
Did he ever have any numbers?

[00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:31.340]
Any following?

[00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:31.980]
Any audience?

[00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:34.440]
No, but he did for whatever reason. They loved Greg B. Del.

[00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:40.240]
And then I started picking on him because I found out that he was extremely sensitive and he was paranoid and thought that everybody hated him.

[00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:41.560]
And then we found out that they did.

[00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:43.500]
Oh, not, that can't be true, Greg.

[00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:46.020]
Now what's the latest that we heard on Greg B. Del?

[00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:47.260]
Is he back on the year somewhere again?

[00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:49.180]
One of those like 40 watt stations or what?

[00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:49.640]
I don't know.

[00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:55.880]
See, I wish everybody in the business, you know, look, well, almost everybody in the business.

[00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:58.560]
830 votes on the poll over the last 10 years.

[00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:00.480]
What is QM's best morning show?

[00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:02.360]
830 on the poll.

[00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:03.600]
We'll make 1,000 easy.

[00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:05.900]
Because we got two hours, 11 minutes to go. Who's counting?

[00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:09.000]
They all sucked. 189. Not good. They all sucked.

[00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:12.960]
Howard Stern, 144, even with all the cheesy poofs in it.

[00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:17.260]
The second first team, DeFo, Delpho, Joe Rosen, Guilty, 113.

[00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:18.920]
Farrell, 110.

[00:17:19.340 --> 00:17:21.300]
Scott Farrell, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

[00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:25.960]
The original first team, 101, which we think is Dave Lamont and Jimmy Ciflis, but nobody seems to know where care.

[00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:29.520]
Hank 68. I hate this poll. 50. That's 6%.

[00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:32.320]
Moan Guilty, 28. Not a good number at all.

[00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:33.420]
28.

[00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:36.800]
And then Kenny and both finally edged ahead by one.

[00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:40.020]
They got 14 votes and DeFo, Guilty, and the broadened the other guy, 13.

[00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:42.540]
In a desperate battle for last place.

[00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:43.340]
Hey, baby!

[00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:48.720]
Hey, Reneerie Air.

[00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:51.020]
Man of your dreams for Uncle Mikey's double-talk school.

[00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:53.660]
That's right, a school of double-talk with all Uncle Mike.

[00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:57.620]
You ever have those embarrassing social situations where you just don't know what to say?

[00:17:57.980 --> 00:17:58.960]
You know, words failure?

[00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:00.680]
Well, Uncle Mikey can help.

[00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:04.500]
By teaching you to say half as much in twice the time, with half the brain power.

[00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:07.120]
We'll reduce your embarrassment by 50%.

[00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:09.060]
You're lonely being embarrassed half as much.

[00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:13.120]
Because instead of thinking about two somethings to say, you only got to think of one something.

[00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:15.480]
Maybe you only have something or something like that.

[00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:18.580]
You know when you meet a girl and you say, my, you look lovely.

[00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:23.800]
Then instead of thinking of another clever line, you just say, my, my, how lovely you look.

[00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:25.420]
It's simple, it's painless.

[00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:27.980]
Best of all, we have easy payment package plans.

[00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:30.020]
We've got package plans at the school of double-talk.

[00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:31.880]
Where is this place, you ask?

[00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:33.340]
Well, I'm glad you asked.

[00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:34.640]
By the last place.

[00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:36.380]
De-de-de-de-de-de-de-de.

[00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:37.920]
I lost my place, but I gotta keep talking.

[00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:39.240]
Because we don't do retakes.

[00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:41.640]
We don't do no retakes at WIO and D.

[00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:42.920]
Heck, I remember.

[00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:45.540]
Ah, Mr. Eagle Air used to blow his nose.

[00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:47.400]
Right in the middle of a couple of his spots there.

[00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:48.520]
Back in the old days.

[00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:50.020]
Ah, here it is.

[00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:50.920]
Here it is.

[00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:54.440]
Part 101, North Bay, Cosway and Beautiful North Bay Village.

[00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:56.360]
That's the Uncle of Mike A. Double-Tark School.

[00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:58.120]
That's the school of double-tark.

[00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:00.100]
1035.

[00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:02.880]
At 560 WQM, good guy, man.

[00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:05.240]
He's, he sleeps with the fishes now, but he was a good guy.

[00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:08.720]
Like I say, that every time we talk about him, he was, he was badly misunderstood.

[00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:10.160]
Just like Alan Burke, you know.

[00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:14.400]
See, a lot of people think because they listen to somebody on the radio that they know,

[00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:18.160]
or you know, watch somebody on TV, they know something about them, which they don't, you know.

[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:19.940]
The renewer is a good guy.

[00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:23.480]
I want to find out what the hell Redbone means.

[00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:25.240]
Somebody QAM, hello.

[00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:27.300]
Could you, it's boom boom.

[00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:30.080]
Oh, okay, a charge being the same all the time.

[00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:34.100]
See, one thing I'm, I was thinking over the weekend because I had way too much time in my hands this weekend.

[00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:35.100]
Way too much.

[00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:41.340]
And this thing with the phone calls, this is another jolly joe bell business where he's, you know, he kept telling me in the beginning,

[00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:44.940]
oh, I just, you know, I just want to leave you alone, you know, you're great and blah, blah, blah, blah.

[00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:46.920]
Just wind you up and let you go, not mess with your show.

[00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:51.780]
But of course, every chance he gets, it's like, oh, you know, the way you treat the, you know, the carers,

[00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:56.540]
that's, you know, the most important part of the show that, that were those calls, you know, the call suck, okay, Joe.

[00:19:56.780 --> 00:19:58.620]
Well, you know about this show or about talk radio.

[00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:02.740]
I put in a thibalent have room for your fat ass 15 times leftover in there, okay.

[00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:08.660]
Well, you know about radio and programming talk radio anyway, you could, you could put all those dropouts in there.

[00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:12.480]
And believe me in our engineering department, that's about all we got is dropouts.

[00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:15.180]
Am I right?

[00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:18.060]
Look how great we were doing without the name calls.

[00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:21.700]
I was kicking ass, man, I had all my bedtime stories here. We were sitting in contaminated,

[00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:23.320]
I'm not talking about the barring.

[00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:26.380]
Yeah, oh, yeah, that's right. I want to read the newspaper, I want to get anything.

[00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:27.440]
W-D-Q-A-N, hello.

[00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:31.720]
Hey, N-E-R, I just want to tell you the best radio guy out there.

[00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:32.300]
Okay, great.

[00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:36.000]
And line nine, we know what it is every time anyways. See, there's nothing on there anyhow.

[00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:42.020]
I mean, red bone, that's something I would think that these people might know something about, although probably like me and you,

[00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:43.440]
they never heard of it in their lives, okay?

[00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:45.660]
I guess maybe we'd have to call Joe Roosevelt that.

[00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:48.980]
Yeah, red bone, my ass.

[00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:53.200]
858 votes on the whole stretch.

[00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:55.540]
We're going to have close to 900 by the top of the tower.

[00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:59.020]
And we got two hours and three minutes to go until like Marlon's pre-game show.

[00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:01.040]
That should be a real ratings builder, man.

[00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:01.900]
Oh, yeah.

[00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:05.300]
We, that should put us right over the top, but maybe like about a one-shear.

[00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:07.340]
W-D-Q-A-N, hello.

[00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:08.700]
One, Neil.

[00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:09.520]
Yes, sir.

[00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:11.280]
All right, you're asking about Redbone.

[00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:11.940]
Yeah.

[00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:15.080]
Then here's the guy, Southern Band Redbone, American Band Tank.

[00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:20.240]
And they were Native Americans and Dick Clark asked them what they said they said it means half-free.

[00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:22.860]
Yeah.

[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.460]
But you know, I'm talking about half-free, you know?

[00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:25.100]
I see.

[00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:29.500]
Some of us kind of like Barack Obama, half-white and half-the-black, right?

[00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:32.060]
I guess.

[00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:33.400]
You guess.

[00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:38.980]
Oh, he looks, I mean, you know, like that brother was under with Colbert, that was a Colbert?

[00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:40.700]
Yes, Steve Colbert.

[00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:43.080]
He said that he wasn't really black and all the way to...

[00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:44.380]
That was funny.

[00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:46.600]
I mean, I was going to say he made a monkey out of her, but then again, so...

[00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:47.280]
Oh, don't say that.

[00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:49.080]
Make something out of yourself.

[00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:50.720]
I heard you say it.

[00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:51.680]
I heard you say it.

[00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:53.580]
I know you meant something racist by the...

[00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:54.920]
Yeah, this is the deal, you know?

[00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:59.520]
When the entire radio industry, and at least in South Florida, is controlled by one person,

[00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:04.660]
who's got way too much time on his hands, and who just are saying that on pins and needles,

[00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:09.120]
waiting to hear something you get agitated about, this is what you people have got.

[00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:11.520]
That's why, you know, we had the stern debacle on the station.

[00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:16.480]
That's why we had the ferell debacle on the station, and that's why we basically can't say crap anymore.

[00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:20.840]
Because these people are like, you know, they're scared of their own shadow.

[00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:23.360]
Oh, gee, he was playing fart noises again.

[00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:24.700]
Oh, what are we going to do now?

[00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:26.060]
Oh, you know, the sky's falling.

[00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:30.940]
I still think, go back to the oldies, man.

[00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:31.840]
It's this way to do it.

[00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:32.160]
It's safe.

[00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:33.240]
Sure.

[00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:35.780]
Like you played you can in a good-and-a-fly and saucy of the day.

[00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:37.200]
That was great radio, man.

[00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:38.980]
You won't hear that on that.

[00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:42.560]
We can play a little red bone for all the red bone women lovers out there for Joe Rose.

[00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:44.940]
Here we go.

[00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:47.240]
I'll very, wait until that believe this dark bone.

[00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:49.320]
That's interesting.

[00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:53.060]
That's really interesting when you see, like on some of those info mercials, you know,

[00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:55.260]
for time life hits of the 50s or 60s, whatever.

[00:22:56.080 --> 00:23:00.020]
And you see groups or recording artists that you never saw before.

[00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:03.120]
And sometimes you thought that they were black and it turns out they were white or vice versa.

[00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:05.260]
And then sometimes turns out they were red bone.

[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:06.440]
Yeah.

[00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:09.540]
I could have sworn Mungo with Jerry Wintwine.

[00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:11.320]
Oh, show me.

[00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:12.180]
Oh, show me.

[00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:13.900]
But nevertheless.

[00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:15.400]
W.C.Y.N. Hello.

[00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:18.960]
C.Y.N.

[00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:20.560]
Hi, Neon. How are you?

[00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:21.320]
Okay, sir.

[00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:24.840]
On Friday on the pole was...never the lift?

[00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:26.860]
Oh, get out of here Friday on the pole.

[00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:28.560]
Get lost. Never less my ass.

[00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:32.300]
Yeah, let's go back and redo Fridays.

[00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:34.500]
I got one for Fridays, pole again, yes.

[00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:38.060]
Well, like I said about this today is a test case for me on these...

[00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:40.200]
You people are on probation today.

[00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:43.560]
This is definitely a test case with these calls.

[00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:45.420]
You know, I need these calls like I need hemorrhoids.

[00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:48.520]
I don't need...you know, I've been doing this long enough 150 years.

[00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:53.340]
I can come in here blindfolded with my hands tied behind my back and my legs tied together with the toes

[00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:54.900]
and then do four hours.

[00:23:55.740 --> 00:23:58.700]
When you've been doing it long enough, man, you know how's to do it.

[00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:05.020]
And the idea that these idiots, these mouth-reading moron and even him, I thought he...

[00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:06.520]
I'm sure he thought he had something to say.

[00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:08.780]
Don't you?

[00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:11.880]
Yeah, I always think somebody's going to have something to say, but then...

[00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:13.960]
No, no, I'm talking about him when he made that call.

[00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:19.260]
He actually thought he had something to say that either I might be interested in or anybody in the human race or subhuman race,

[00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:20.380]
might be interested in hearing.

[00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:22.420]
Nobody wants to hear what you just said, sir.

[00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:26.680]
Nobody, but nevertheless, don't ever call this show again.

[00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:28.960]
In fact, you may have been the last caller until this next one.

[00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:29.660]
QAM, hello.

[00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:31.360]
Yeah, hi, Neil.

[00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:32.380]
Yes, ma'am.

[00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:35.340]
Do you think they got some good talk show, folks?

[00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:38.060]
Yeah, aha.

[00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:39.960]
WQAM, hello.

[00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:41.080]
Good afternoon.

[00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:42.140]
Good evening.

[00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:42.940]
Okay.

[00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:47.980]
I understand you did a chicken show once a week, I missed it.

[00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:51.820]
WQAM, hello.

[00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:54.540]
We're tied already.

[00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:56.140]
WQAM, hello.

[00:24:57.300 --> 00:24:58.360]
Mr. Rogers, please.

[00:24:58.760 --> 00:24:59.580]
Yes, speaking, sir.

[00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:01.780]
This is a Neil.

[00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:04.700]
Who is it, then? Who is it, the other one?

[00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:05.280]
Oh, a cranson.

[00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:07.580]
No, it's you. I'm sorry, Neil. I'm sorry.

[00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:10.760]
Listen, let me say something you were off the bat, okay?

[00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:14.480]
When you call this number, there is nobody else going to answer it, okay?

[00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:17.740]
So the idea that you're going to insult me by giving me a song, this isn't Neil.

[00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:19.400]
Who the hell do you think it is, okay?

[00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:20.100]
George Washington?

[00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:21.360]
George Washington Carver?

[00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:23.020]
I want to have your answer.

[00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:25.260]
What do you got for a sir, say something for Christ's.

[00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:30.120]
Well, first of all, I was really surprised that someone knew noodles besides me.

[00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:30.900]
I met him a few years ago.

[00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:33.240]
Okay, good. Well, I'm happy for it. WQAM, hello.

[00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:35.920]
This is Neil.

[00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:36.980]
This is Neil.

[00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:37.780]
This is great.

[00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:39.140]
It is great.

[00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:41.520]
I'm going to do this all the time.

[00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:42.760]
I got my whole pile here.

[00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:43.640]
Oh, tomorrow.

[00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:44.740]
It's a long week, you know.

[00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:46.080]
It's a Monday to Friday.

[00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:48.600]
Do say it for tomorrow, because remember this happened last week.

[00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:51.480]
We had a strong Monday, as they say in the world.

[00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:52.760]
It was a strong Monday.

[00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:56.820]
And as Tuesday, you say, by a call, it's another thing you used to say on the first team all the time.

[00:25:57.040 --> 00:25:58.460]
Oh, boy, that was really strong.

[00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:00.140]
George, by you.

[00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:01.760]
It was really strong, you know.

[00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:06.160]
Some of the jackass would call up and make some stupid ass comment about a dumb ass ball game.

[00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:07.520]
Oh, that was really strong.

[00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:08.340]
Wasn't it depot?

[00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:09.400]
That was really strong.

[00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:11.140]
Here we go.

[00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:12.500]
And now we got him fired up today.

[00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:13.020]
Big time.

[00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:15.400]
This is your probationary period, okay?

[00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:19.380]
You got like an hour and 48 minutes, but who's counting?

[00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:20.660]
WDQYM, hello.

[00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:26.420]
Hey, I was wondering if you think that the Bill Olsen guy has a chance in the election.

[00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:27.440]
I guess.

[00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:29.020]
WDQYM, hello.

[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.080]
WDQYM, hello.

[00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:37.460]
WDQYM, hello.

[00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:38.580]
WDQYM, hello.

[00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:41.100]
WDQYM, hello.

[00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:42.440]
WDQYM, hello.

[00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:46.340]
Keeping off the Indian reservation, baby.

[00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:47.120]
Yeah.

[00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:51.380]
Just speaking of depot, that guy sounds like a real...

[00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:54.000]
Don't be picking on the red man now, okay?

[00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:56.020]
You'll get that peace pipe out and come after you with it.

[00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:56.660]
You got a pipe?

[00:26:57.080 --> 00:26:58.060]
You got them bows and arrows.

[00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:02.840]
Or maybe you'll just say to some of them cancels the extra piece of that pipe with the worms in them.

[00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:04.360]
WDQYM, hello.

[00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:07.320]
Hey, Neil, I think you're number three.

[00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:08.340]
No, okay, good.

[00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:09.340]
WDQYM, hello.

[00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:10.160]
Neil.

[00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:10.820]
Yeah.

[00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:13.420]
I've written something I want to get Susan Gray.

[00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:14.280]
Okay.

[00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:16.640]
Okay, there's the Susan Gray guy again, okay?

[00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:20.480]
Which nobody in the world has any idea who it is and believe me, talk about swishful thinking.

[00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:22.600]
WDQYM, hello.

[00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:24.600]
Yeah, Neil, what do you think about the Marlin?

[00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:26.040]
I don't.

[00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:27.200]
WDQYM, hello.

[00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:29.100]
Yeah, hello.

[00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:30.200]
Yeah, hello.

[00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:31.780]
Yeah, hello.

[00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:33.480]
There's a queue I have.

[00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:36.440]
Sir, what did I just say when I answered you?

[00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:37.360]
I said QAM.

[00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:38.400]
What does that sound like?

[00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:39.240]
QAM, yes.

[00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:41.280]
There I'm gay.

[00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:42.880]
Okay, well congratulations.

[00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:43.640]
Yeah.

[00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:45.340]
WDQYM, hello.

[00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:46.200]
Neil.

[00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:47.060]
Yes, sir.

[00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:48.440]
Am I going?

[00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:49.560]
Man.

[00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:51.160]
For the other guy that just called.

[00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:51.500]
Right.

[00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:52.500]
WDQYM, hello.

[00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:53.680]
Do you want a life course?

[00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:54.460]
I'm sent to you.

[00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:55.900]
WDQYM, hello.

[00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:58.280]
Yes, happy for them to you.

[00:27:58.800 --> 00:27:59.300]
WDQYM, yes.

[00:27:59.440 --> 00:27:59.720]
Too late.

[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:00.660]
QAM, hello.

[00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:02.280]
Yeah, can I speak to the man?

[00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:03.220]
Don't.

[00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:05.320]
All right.

[00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:06.020]
Hold on.

[00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:06.720]
Now we're talking.

[00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:09.540]
872 votes on this pool.

[00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:12.840]
Yeah, I'm just in the mood for this today, man.

[00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:17.000]
I want to go through at least 40,000 of these calls between now and the 1250.

[00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:17.520]
Why, why not?

[00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:18.460]
Why not?

[00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:19.140]
Huh?

[00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:19.980]
Why not?

[00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:22.820]
We might have just 10 callers, but we'll have 40,000 calls.

[00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:23.660]
That's okay.

[00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:24.580]
Keep them off the street.

[00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:25.980]
It's a pubic service from us.

[00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:26.980]
I know I have to charge, man.

[00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:30.660]
Still only 237 dropouts on our streaming so far.

[00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:33.100]
So I guess we must have the thickest by now, huh?

[00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:34.820]
We must have it ficcist.

[00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:40.380]
Over the last 10 years, what is QAM's best morning show, they all sucked 197.

[00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:41.440]
Wow.

[00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:42.960]
That's almost a quarter of all of votes.

[00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:44.920]
Howard Spurman, 154.

[00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:47.740]
The second first team, Defo Joe wasn't guilty, 120.

[00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:49.200]
Far out, 118.

[00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:53.820]
The original first team, 007, which we still, you know, whatever you say it is.

[00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:54.960]
Hank 71.

[00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:57.840]
I hate this pool 54, a mere 6.1%.

[00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:01.180]
Moan Gelde, boy, you talk about a drop off, only 31.

[00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:02.540]
Moan Gelde.

[00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:07.260]
And then it's a really desperate life and death battle for last place.

[00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:08.840]
Kenny and Beaumorning Show 14.

[00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:13.640]
That's the hysterical Kenny and Beaumorning Show, which I must miss the lot of those punchlines,

[00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:15.400]
but man there's a lot of laughter on that show.

[00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:23.080]
Kenny and Beaumor 14 and holding up the rear, Defo Gelde, the broad and the other guy, only 13.

[00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:24.920]
The Neal Roger Show.

[00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:26.740]
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

[00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:27.680]
This is your going.

[00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:30.680]
Any questions?

[00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:38.160]
And now here's Timmy Dean, founder of Timmy Dean Forks' Osage, with a few words about new Timmy Dean Vagal sandwiches.

[00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:39.860]
Hello, I'm Timmy Dean.

[00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:45.260]
You know, if someone had told me 25 years ago that I'd be making bagels, I'd have said,

[00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:45.720]
huh?

[00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:47.520]
That's Jew food, isn't it?

[00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:51.080]
But times have changed, and I guess I've got to change with them.

[00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:52.680]
But I don't have to like it.

[00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:55.740]
You people want your bagels, I'll give you your bagels.

[00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:59.420]
With a bagel greases slab at Timmy Dean Forks' Osage, on it.

[00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:02.500]
New Timmy Dean non-coachier bagel sandwiches.

[00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:04.480]
If you're Jewish, you can buy them.

[00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:05.700]
You just can eat them.

[00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:07.580]
New Timmy Dean Vagal sandwiches.

[00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:09.760]
There's a little bit of big in it, everybody.

[00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:12.060]
It's 11 o'clock at 5.60 WDQM.

[00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:14.680]
Here's the facts that says, how come I got a new schedule again, by the way?

[00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:16.140]
Is there something we've vies that we didn't know about?

[00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:17.740]
There was a new schedule in the box.

[00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:18.620]
I don't ask questions.

[00:30:18.620 --> 00:30:19.880]
I would just forward them along.

[00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:21.640]
Looks like the same old crap I had before.

[00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:24.560]
Although, either rumor I'm starting now is the Marlon Games 1115.

[00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:25.060]
Woo!

[00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:26.600]
Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.

[00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:27.640]
Anyway.

[00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:29.760]
Oh, University dodged again.

[00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:31.720]
You think, you know, it's just amazing to me.

[00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:36.300]
I sure hope there's some cars down the road there, or up the road where the hell it is.

[00:30:37.780 --> 00:30:40.160]
Because they sure spent a lot of time faxing us crap.

[00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:44.460]
It says, somewhere along the line, I believe, Steve Shapiro was part of the worst team.

[00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:45.940]
You know, Shappy?

[00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:46.840]
Hey, Shappy!

[00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:50.060]
Shappy, my ass.

[00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:51.060]
Steve Shapiro.

[00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:51.860]
Slapy?

[00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:53.200]
Slapy, Shappy.

[00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:57.740]
898, we're going to go over 900 during this assignment on our poll.

[00:30:58.220 --> 00:31:01.640]
And then we got a thousand in the bag, in the sack, in that big old sack, baby.

[00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:03.160]
Do you hear what he said?

[00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:03.940]
He said, suck!

[00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:05.140]
I know what he meant by that, yeah.

[00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:06.400]
As in, sack a crap.

[00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:08.700]
Red bone.

[00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:10.300]
I mean, everything is a big deal.

[00:31:10.460 --> 00:31:11.600]
Okay, what did he mean by that?

[00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:14.240]
Everybody's got to be all on edge, you know?

[00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:17.080]
Because one guy's got too much time on his hands.

[00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:18.020]
That's what it's all about.

[00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:21.820]
I think that's what I'm going to do the rest of my life.

[00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:24.860]
I'm going to declare myself the self-appointed censor.

[00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:27.940]
And if I don't like something or I find some reason to get all bent out of shape with it,

[00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:29.320]
I'm going to make a big stink about it.

[00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:29.840]
How do you like that?

[00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:30.280]
Why not?

[00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:31.300]
Yes, stink.

[00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:33.040]
I'm an ethicist I've just decided.

[00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:37.660]
Our free speech case is divided present and bush from key supporters of his base.

[00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:41.620]
As many religious rights groups have joined the ACA, you and others,

[00:31:41.620 --> 00:31:45.020]
and defending the rights of high school students and article in yesterday's New York Times says,

[00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:47.600]
in fact, they just had it here on CNN the only moments ago.

[00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:52.860]
The case which will be argued in front of the Supreme Court today is open at unexpected fissure.

[00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:55.860]
Fissures like something you have in your act, though, yeah.

[00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:56.680]
And opening.

[00:31:57.460 --> 00:32:01.640]
A fissure between the Bush administration and its usual allies among conservative Christian supporters,

[00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:02.940]
Linda Greenhouse says,

[00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:05.860]
now you're going to be interested in this story.

[00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:06.940]
You know, the one this is all about?

[00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:08.500]
Bonhearts for Jesus.

[00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:09.220]
Oh, yeah.

[00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:16.660]
On the surface, Joseph Fredericks dispute with his principal Deborah Morse at the Juno Douglas High School in Alaska five years ago,

[00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:19.480]
appeared to have a little of anything to do with religion, Greenhouse rights.

[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:25.120]
As the Olympic torch was carried to the streets of Juno on its way to the 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake City,

[00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:27.120]
and his TV cameras focused on the scene,

[00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:30.980]
Frederick and some friends unfrold a 14-foot-long banner with the inscription,

[00:32:31.460 --> 00:32:32.500]
Bonhearts for Jesus.

[00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:33.380]
All right.

[00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:35.940]
Smoke a big fat one for the Lord, man.

[00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:36.860]
Pass it around.

[00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:42.040]
The principal tore it down the sign after Frederick initially refused your demand to remove the banner

[00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:43.820]
and suspended him for 10 days.

[00:32:46.020 --> 00:32:50.280]
The Bush administration entered the case on the side of the principal on the Juno School Board of Greenhouse knows,

[00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:55.200]
of course, on the side of fascism and intolerance and all this other crap and stupidity.

[00:32:56.060 --> 00:32:56.860]
But Greenhouse continues,

[00:32:57.960 --> 00:33:02.360]
while it's hardly surprising to find the ACLU and the National Coalition against censorship on Fredericks side,

[00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:07.720]
it is the array of briefs and organizations that litigate and speak on behalf of generally conservative Christian groups

[00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:10.760]
that's lifted more versus Frederick out of the realm of the ordinary.

[00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:15.880]
The groups include the American Center for Longest, disfounded by the Reverend Pat Robertson,

[00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:19.720]
the Christian Legal Society, and the Alliance Defense Fund,

[00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:23.200]
the Rutherford Institute, which has participated in many religion cases before the court,

[00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:28.580]
and Liberty Legal Institute, a non-profit law firm dedicated to the preservation of first amendment rights and religious freedom.

[00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:32.400]
The Institute, based in Plano, Texas told the justices in its brief,

[00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:36.380]
that it was gravely concerned that the religious freedom of students in public schools were redemaged

[00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:38.080]
if the court rules for the school board.

[00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:43.200]
Religious freedom of students in public schools, what is Bong-Hitz for Jesus?

[00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:45.300]
I see they're smoking a fat one for the Lord, right?

[00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:48.500]
Isn't that religion? That was all about the same crap.

[00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:49.340]
That's the common.

[00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:50.540]
The color crapola.

[00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:55.740]
Douglas Lakecock of the University of Michigan Law School on authority on Constitutional issues.

[00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:02.520]
An authority on Constitutional issues.

[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:11.040]
An authority.

[00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:13.080]
What word did you say?

[00:34:13.380 --> 00:34:16.560]
Issues in popping religion, who worked on the Liberty Legal Institute,

[00:34:16.700 --> 00:34:22.320]
which said that religiously observant students often find the atmosphere in public school to be unwelcoming and feel themselves a dissonant,

[00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:23.140]
and a school that minority.

[00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:24.580]
Good. Problem in drip.

[00:34:24.580 --> 00:34:28.020]
He said, the status of the United States isn't sunny this side.

[00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:30.840]
When you calm down, take a pill for Christ's sake.

[00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:33.080]
Maybe that story again will be a bad one for Jesus.

[00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:35.240]
I'm not reading that story. No mo. No mo.

[00:34:52.520 --> 00:35:05.220]
No mo. No mo. No mo. No mo. No mo. No mo. No mo. No mo. No mo. No mo. No mo. No mo. No mo. No mo. No mo. No mo. No mo. No mo. No mo. No mo. No mo. No mo. No mo. No mo. No mo. No mo. No mo. No mo. No mo. No mo. No mo. No mo. No mo. No mo. No mo. No mo. No mo. No mo. No mo. No mo. No mo. No mo. No mo. No mo. No mo. No mo. No mo. No mo. No mo. No mo. No mo. No mo. No mo. No mo. No mo. No mo.

[00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:34.180]
deins, no mo

[00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:40.140]
I'm trying to carry read as the Senate majority leaders for the last time I checked over regardless. Thanks for your expertise

[00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:48.260]
916 hosts on the pool especially that guy, you know like that Congress guy from Illinois that wants to be president or from Illinois

[00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:51.900]
That guy that guy that kind of like Redbone guy

Mojo, I think I'm going to be sick. You're fired. I've got one go man

[00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:52.460]

You know, I mean I granted it to Monday, but nevertheless without anything they would be smoking because this is their last chance

[00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:30.040]
Remember that day when I said this is the last call I remember taking on a show

[00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:35.140]
That was the smartest thing I ever did my life and then the stupidest thing I ever did was going back and start taking him again

[00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:39.080]
It's done. That's done. It's finished. It's it's over Funito, baby

[00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:42.400]
That is a stale as last year's wonder bread, okay

[00:41:43.860 --> 00:41:46.660]

[00:41:54.940 --> 00:42:02.500]
Maybe this part ain't broken yet. Although you're working on that pretty good looks like and at last trend a death knell a death knell for all of us

[00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:04.460]
But nevertheless

[00:42:06.180 --> 00:42:08.620]
It's just you know and Bruce Beasley you know what he says

[00:42:09.420 --> 00:42:14.380]

Mean Q a m hello. I didn't even do it say your week your week

[00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:30.620]
Now if we had a wheel call and this uh what has been hour and a quarter?

[00:42:30.780 --> 00:42:35.380]
I mean I'm taking calls on our record. We had the guy that called and explained red bow into us

[00:42:35.380 --> 00:42:39.500]
Oh, yeah, that guy was really largely lasting and then he said well

[00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:43.060]
I can't think of uh there's so many good examples. I don't know what any of marry. You know like that

[00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:47.180]
And that would be like saying there's a lot of great stuff to say when you call radio tof sure

[00:42:47.180 --> 00:42:50.520]
I just don't have any of it to say that that that that would be like saying that you know

[00:42:52.060 --> 00:42:56.520]
Wouldn't it be something if we actually heard something like that today if somebody called actually had something to say

[00:42:56.520 --> 00:42:59.940]
I'm not holding my breath. Well, you never know. I doubt it

[00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:02.360]

Okay, great

[00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:20.340]
I don't have to get mad about anything anymore because the news took me exactly what I should should not be upset about

[00:44:20.340 --> 00:44:25.460]
I'm really happy about that just that's all I got new. Okay. Yeah, not much Q a m. Hello

WQ a m hello and you know what's going on? How are you doing sir? Listen, I

[00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:38.400]
What is it with people calling up and saying I'm out of material so they say something stupid?

[00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:42.620]
Did it because they never had anybody to be ending to begin with?

[00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:43.420]
Ah, I see

[00:44:44.380 --> 00:44:47.900]

[00:45:20.300 --> 00:45:25.060]
Just little things like today is the fourth anniversary of our lovely war here

[00:45:25.060 --> 00:45:29.420]
And we're still not sure what the score is. Yeah, and what would you like these people to say about it?

[00:45:30.380 --> 00:45:31.680]
Uh, good question

[00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:33.560]

I'm not the other day at a bank and a guy turns to his friend and says so who you gonna vote for in the election

[00:45:50.440 --> 00:45:55.440]
And I swear the guy turned to him and said I'm gonna vote for whatever president grants me

[00:45:55.440 --> 00:46:01.620]
Clemency for the murder of any idiot who asked me two years away who I'm voting for

[00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:03.100]

You're doing a heck of a job, Joe ma'am. I'm gonna tell you any guy that can come in in just over a year

[00:46:59.460 --> 00:47:04.900]

[00:47:04.900 --> 00:47:06.560]
You've got you got a hand in to him

[00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:12.540]
phenomenal job it's a good thing they don't care about that and you'll be very pleased to know that Kenny and Boar just edging out the

[00:47:12.540 --> 00:47:16.360]
Defoe guilty the broad and the other guy in a last place just barely

[00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:23.140]
By the skin of their teeth skin of the rags qa. I'm hello. Hey, how you doing? Okay a couple things the court it was a

[00:47:23.900 --> 00:47:27.420]
I get the London Times and it was narkle about a guy in

[00:47:27.420 --> 00:47:33.340]
Canada that up scammed it would almost 70 million dollars from either a corporation or the government. You didn't know about that

[00:47:33.340 --> 00:47:37.580]
So what about it? I don't know you usually bring up stuff in the United States

[00:47:37.580 --> 00:47:43.660]
You didn't make any issue about that. What does that mean when in other words? There's no crooks in Canada. Is that my message here?

[00:47:44.660 --> 00:47:49.180]
Now there's crooks everywhere. So so what is the point point is I made an idiot be marty

[00:47:50.360 --> 00:47:56.900]
Uh also one out of two I mean one out of 200 homes United States or the fault thing on oh god are you boring?

[00:47:58.500 --> 00:47:58.900]
Oh

[00:48:00.660 --> 00:48:02.040]
Maybe the faxes are good

[00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:09.880]
It's a George this is just for you no need to send to the old man. Oh, that's what huh? I said well guess what I thought you could uh

[00:48:11.140 --> 00:48:17.400]
He'll spend time with a shirt. Well, whatever. It's still something interesting. Okay. I mean it's a full call

[00:48:17.400 --> 00:48:23.200]
It says a red bone no it sure isn't like like this last guy. Oh and they're a crack sold 70 million dollars from a summer

[00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:24.820]
And so who cares

[00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:33.820]
Why is anybody who's listening to me right now to the sound of my voice give a flying crap about what that guy just said even he doesn't care about it

[00:48:34.440 --> 00:48:39.040]
How come you're not talking about the crooks in Canada and everybody's on the up and up up there, huh?

[00:48:40.100 --> 00:48:41.660]
But your crooks in Canada

[00:48:42.660 --> 00:48:49.240]
You stay there pal. I'll stay here and that's a deal a red bone is a term for light skin black person usually darker than the person you would call

[00:48:49.240 --> 00:48:51.400]
High yellow, which is often an insult

[00:48:52.300 --> 00:48:57.840]
I haven't even heard of any of these things. How yellow my ass. I'll bet the term is that like old yellow

[00:48:58.400 --> 00:49:04.740]
The term is not used as much because there are so many lighten and bioracial people of that color that those terms are more frequently used

[00:49:04.740 --> 00:49:11.620]
Like somebody might say she's Hispanic looking or bioracial rather than she's red much more common to refer them as red than red bone

[00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:17.080]
I never heard of anybody being referred to as red. I mean me this or red bone or anything

[00:49:17.080 --> 00:49:22.980]
Examples beyond say Rosario Dawson Vanessa Williams close to yellow it says where some old Jennifer Beals

[00:49:23.480 --> 00:49:30.380]
Would be high yellow or be said to be able to pass as in pass for white that this is all just your issue whoever wrote this was right

[00:49:30.380 --> 00:49:36.740]
I mean you talk about making a big simmiss it says a hornet says that rose stepped on and I try to call that

[00:49:36.740 --> 00:49:41.080]
Dases the fact here is that there is an old racial subdivide in the black American community

[00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:44.860]
It's considered a huge issue in the African American even Caribbean American community

[00:49:44.860 --> 00:49:50.880]
This is just the kind of thing someone can paint it to an explore a explode more importantly in subigual in the black community

[00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:54.820]
Joe's real problem is the Cavalier approach he turned to the topic it says

[00:49:54.820 --> 00:49:57.240]
I can only assume he had no ideas to the weight of his words

[00:49:57.240 --> 00:50:01.780]
But to say most brothers don't like chocolate he'd be better off saying blacks are better athletes and worse

[00:50:01.780 --> 00:50:05.260]
I could demis than this is whatever else

[00:50:06.500 --> 00:50:10.920]
And this goes on and the whole thing is just stupid is what it is okay if you ask me just stupid

[00:50:10.920 --> 00:50:11.900]
It's a big waste of time

[00:50:11.900 --> 00:50:15.700]
It's like arguing about which drop of water out of the faucet is going to taste the best okay

[00:50:15.700 --> 00:50:20.380]
I mean it's a stupid is what it is idiotic moronic you fair right

[00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:23.080]
But thanks for killing about two three minutes there was good

[00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:28.980]
971 on the pool now we're talking my language now we're talking something I can relate to you know what I mean

[00:50:29.900 --> 00:50:35.260]
971 sounds like fun getting close to a thousand votes on the pool on a Monday with the stupid ass Marlon exhibition game with the ass

[00:50:35.260 --> 00:50:37.540]
Throw some Jupiter coming up in 1250 this afternoon

[00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:41.540]
Don't forget Hank will be on after the game then he can't seven o'clock any interest

[00:50:42.220 --> 00:50:42.640]
No

[00:50:44.220 --> 00:50:45.060]
Really amazing

[00:50:45.060 --> 00:50:48.300]
I mean wouldn't wouldn't you think that would what's going on there would be people

[00:50:48.940 --> 00:50:56.340]
I would assume that there would be people after that last trend came I thought would be running up and down in a whole ways screaming and shrieking like crazy people you know

[00:50:57.600 --> 00:51:01.360]
At least asking do you like it like that you know something no

[00:51:01.900 --> 00:51:03.220]
But they aren't

[00:51:03.220 --> 00:51:04.840]
Maybe they're just oblivious do you think

[00:51:05.560 --> 00:51:11.460]
Which reminds me again of my favorite saying and it's I shouldn't have been on that list and it wasn't because it's a great saying where there's no sense

[00:51:11.900 --> 00:51:12.780]
There's no feeling

[00:51:13.820 --> 00:51:15.380]
In other words feel this

[00:51:15.380 --> 00:51:23.060]
And I'm opening up the hottest hair salon in the country you gotta check out Britney Shares salon

[00:51:23.780 --> 00:51:31.400]
Don't think girl no more extensions color interconditioning no more tees in or blood drying heck no more

[00:51:32.540 --> 00:51:40.920]
Several off the wall styles for you to choose from there's the co-jack the Jean-Luc the card the death row in night and my favorite

[00:51:40.920 --> 00:51:42.520]
The Shenandoe corner

[00:51:45.340 --> 00:51:49.740]
Nothing compares to our low

[00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:54.400]
Britney Shares prices you have to be nuts not to come on in

[00:51:55.160 --> 00:52:01.200]
More new hair or lack of it. It's sure to be a hit even though I don't really know what one of those is anymore

[00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:08.480]
But I do know a style for Britney Shares is perfect for the insane life of a crazy single mom

[00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:09.660]
So come on down

[00:52:10.300 --> 00:52:15.460]
Yes, cut the crap while you're a busy cutting Britney. Oh, it's Jesus 1131 at 560 W.

[00:52:15.580 --> 00:52:19.520]

[00:52:20.820 --> 00:52:21.280]

Larry Williams is he white is he black is he red bone is he a thick bone or they just

[00:52:31.460 --> 00:52:35.020]
Would you rather be red bone or hand bone on the hand bone all the way

[00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:35.880]
Yeah

[00:52:36.620 --> 00:52:43.160]
By the way no more calls this week and no more mush that that's my motto today no enough of them mush enough of the stupid ass calls

[00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:48.560]
And that's a private the piece of information. Okay, it's not for you. All right

[00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:53.780]
Just just because I say stuff that doesn't necessarily mean it's for your ears. Okay. No, I understand eyes only

[00:52:53.780 --> 00:52:56.260]
Out loud

[00:52:57.380 --> 00:52:58.620]

[00:53:11.960 --> 00:53:13.220]
Tell you what I'm gonna do

[00:53:14.180 --> 00:53:14.820]
Jimmy Durantia

[00:53:15.760 --> 00:53:19.680]
No, it was look good. Yeah, he used to play the piano and sing

[00:53:20.240 --> 00:53:24.440]
That's what he was doing and the comedian but he was a comic but he was a piano guy man

[00:53:25.040 --> 00:53:29.240]
Victor Borgop played the piano to or at least used a threaten to but he never played a piano. We do he was a great

[00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:32.300]
Pianist too by the way, can I say that Joyce? No, I can't say penis

[00:53:33.220 --> 00:53:34.400]

Victor Borgop played the piano. Hey, I sound pretty good today for me, you know, I like the way I sounded on there

[00:53:51.900 --> 00:53:55.960]
I don't know about you, but I'm usually one of those people that doesn't like the sound of my own voice

[00:53:55.960 --> 00:53:59.560]
He's doing everybody. I think everybody hates the sound of their own voice

[00:53:59.560 --> 00:54:03.320]
I couldn't be wrong about that, but I mean what the hell do I know about radio anyway, you know

[00:54:03.780 --> 00:54:06.620]
I know that the pay is pretty good for me and I'm just gonna continue

[00:54:06.620 --> 00:54:10.740]
I'm gonna continue to hop it up those big checks and have it a wonderful time with it, you know

[00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:14.460]
WQ.Y.M. Hello

[00:54:16.140 --> 00:54:18.540]
Oh, she's my favorite week. That's the third time in a week

[00:54:19.320 --> 00:54:20.220]
WQ.Y.M. Hello

[00:54:20.980 --> 00:54:24.200]
And a great big one who uses the brush the baby sitter's teeth with

[00:54:24.940 --> 00:54:25.820]
WQ.Y.M. Hello

[00:54:26.400 --> 00:54:27.060]
Hi, good morning

[00:54:27.060 --> 00:54:32.440]
Yes, I've been out of town for about two years now. I got back finally able to listen to you again

[00:54:32.440 --> 00:54:36.100]
Just a quick question. Are you still going to Vegas? Like you used to a lot?

[00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:37.580]
No, I never go to Vegas anymore

[00:54:37.580 --> 00:54:40.740]
Why do I want to go to Vegas when I got my woodbind right here or Niagara Falls?

[00:54:41.020 --> 00:54:43.980]
What do I want to schlep all the way out there in the middle of the desert for us in a miles away?

[00:54:44.380 --> 00:54:46.520]
I used to ramp and rave about how great it was

[00:54:46.520 --> 00:54:48.700]
Well, it is great if you want to go all the way out there

[00:54:48.700 --> 00:54:52.820]
It's just far no matter where unless you live in California or somewhere as far as a schlep

[00:54:53.340 --> 00:54:54.180]
I was just curious

[00:54:54.180 --> 00:54:57.540]
I don't know where to go to here again. Okay, thanks probably welcome back

[00:54:57.540 --> 00:55:00.760]
Well, let's see he came back after two years. He wants to know why still go on to Vegas

[00:55:00.760 --> 00:55:04.820]
What he's trying to say is I have no idea. What do you care if I'm going to Vegas? What does that do for you?

[00:55:05.120 --> 00:55:06.140]
Okay, who did know

[00:55:07.460 --> 00:55:11.460]
For your life. I mean, what what does that got to do with anything? Am I still going to Vegas?

[00:55:11.460 --> 00:55:17.300]
You know, I mean it's one thing if I can come on here and pass along some useful information or some useful gas or something like that

[00:55:19.660 --> 00:55:24.000]
What what is this tell you though? Let me just let me say if you right now very clearly all of a sudden

[00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:28.940]
Something like I like how they religious experience you know anybody down and the

[00:55:28.940 --> 00:55:31.320]
I'm reborn baby reborn

[00:55:36.180 --> 00:55:41.440]
The whole concept of what's going on here is insanity these people are got nothing to say

[00:55:41.440 --> 00:55:48.440]
They didn't have anything to say last week six weeks before she was 45 weeks before t-shirt above and what makes anybody think they're gonna have anything to say

[00:55:50.240 --> 00:55:54.860]
That's a phone call on a torsion and this guy's one of the more lucid people we've had that's the best part

[00:55:54.860 --> 00:55:57.700]
Remember that's your I love lucid he's one of the more lucid people we've had

[00:55:58.540 --> 00:56:02.700]
And he actually thought that he had something to say in my he was away for two years now

[00:56:02.700 --> 00:56:04.960]
We can listen again am I still going to Vegas?

[00:56:06.920 --> 00:56:13.180]
That's like saying am I still a pervert? Yes, so what about am I still the little fat? Yes, so and how does that affect your life sir?

[00:56:13.740 --> 00:56:15.720]
How can that possibly be useful to anybody?

[00:56:17.900 --> 00:56:18.220]
I

[00:56:18.220 --> 00:56:21.740]
Want to lose my ass that I'm off ear in an hour and 15 minutes of that I'm counting

[00:56:21.740 --> 00:56:24.040]
I can call my can't be right now during this next break

[00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:28.540]
And I can have him pick me up at 10 to one or five to one and go out there lose oh, I don't know how much I wanted

[00:56:28.540 --> 00:56:32.220]
Would buy today depending on how much sure I'll strong my stomach is to put up with it

[00:56:32.700 --> 00:56:34.020]
Do you know I'm saying what he said?

[00:56:35.900 --> 00:56:37.700]
I'm saying I've had a real

[00:56:39.480 --> 00:56:40.400]
Experience here today

[00:56:41.740 --> 00:56:47.120]
Do you know what that means is it fly opening or I open no another fly opener? That's hopefully that'll be later

[00:56:47.120 --> 00:56:49.900]
You know hope I hope for that every day, but you know

[00:56:51.140 --> 00:56:55.440]
When you get to be when you get to be in my station in life and I'm not talking about this station

[00:56:55.440 --> 00:56:59.580]
When you get to my station life. It's a little bit of a you know optimistic altitude

[00:57:00.340 --> 00:57:01.560]
Felt it a Q.A.M. Hello

[00:57:02.660 --> 00:57:04.460]
Hi, I don't know what I was supposed to say

[00:57:04.960 --> 00:57:05.320]
so

[00:57:06.620 --> 00:57:09.200]
So I got a good idea. How's it?

[00:57:09.920 --> 00:57:15.560]
See you come on see you can do it. See you WQ a.m. Hello

[00:57:17.500 --> 00:57:18.540]
Q.A.M.

[00:57:19.100 --> 00:57:23.460]
Get past all got to go. Yeah, I like that. I don't know why I don't know what I'm supposed to say

[00:57:23.460 --> 00:57:24.800]
Mm-hmm

[00:57:25.380 --> 00:57:30.120]
I think he was the epitome is Ed Merle would say the epitome of what it's all about

[00:57:32.240 --> 00:57:37.220]
I'm ecstatic. I'm the leader. I don't know where the hell this all came from today, you know, I just out of the blue out of nowhere

[00:57:38.460 --> 00:57:42.180]
But the good news is we have 995 votes

[00:57:44.800 --> 00:57:49.660]
I'm gonna pull it's only 1137 and Chris was worried about getting a thousand before ballgame time

[00:57:49.660 --> 00:57:55.040]
Which is a minute and 13 minutes an hour into the third whatever it is away. You go see now aren't you? Yes

[00:57:55.720 --> 00:57:58.860]
No, I know actually. I've got this is a great day of clarity for me. Okay

[00:57:59.480 --> 00:58:02.000]
My eyes have seen the coming of the glory of

[00:58:02.780 --> 00:58:08.500]
That's right. Whatever the hell that means my eyes have seen the coming of us something worthy, you know of the Redbone man

[00:58:09.580 --> 00:58:15.580]
That's stupid ass article about the you know the the self-appointed sensor and always on Joe Rose because Joe said days

[00:58:15.580 --> 00:58:19.280]
And this one said redball who cares already. Okay get a life

[00:58:19.840 --> 00:58:28.260]
It's partly monotonous syndrome a South Florida neurotic repetition the same old same old the same old people doing the same old tired crap

[00:58:28.260 --> 00:58:29.660]
Making the same old noise

[00:58:30.180 --> 00:58:31.900]
Like a bunch of overgrown children

[00:58:32.420 --> 00:58:33.140]
Like that

[00:58:33.960 --> 00:58:35.380]
That's the sound of South Florida

[00:58:36.080 --> 00:58:37.280]
Young people doing that

[00:58:37.700 --> 00:58:41.180]
Which you expect that from like infants and old people doing that

[00:58:41.980 --> 00:58:43.240]
That's South Florida for you

[00:58:44.360 --> 00:58:49.480]
Oh, but there was this guy in Canada who embezzled 70 million dollar like that guy's trying to give me a son of a man

[00:58:49.480 --> 00:58:55.540]
He's trying to give me a sell job on how Canada is so bad. Oh, it's terrible. I don't know how to I'm gonna put up with it, you know

[00:58:57.240 --> 00:59:04.380]
WQ a.m. Hello Neil God speaking you've always had a fact and part of the fun of listening to you with these colors

[00:59:04.380 --> 00:59:09.560]
It's like watching the professional baseball players when they're able to hit balls out in the fielders

[00:59:09.560 --> 00:59:14.820]
And they just crush them and it goes right to the guy. It's amazing. I don't know how you do it. Keep it up

[00:59:21.100 --> 00:59:21.580]
Oh

[00:59:21.580 --> 00:59:27.660]
Yeah, this is a real challenge crushing these calls man. This you have to be a real talent to do this

[00:59:28.140 --> 00:59:28.620]
Woo

[00:59:29.240 --> 00:59:33.280]
Well the way you handle those calls Neil that's what's really the entertaining part of yes

[00:59:33.280 --> 00:59:40.620]
I've been Joe you wouldn't know this show if George and Chris came in your studio in an extra in your office next to he's saying and bitch you on each cheek

[00:59:40.620 --> 00:59:42.140]
Okay, you still know what's going on

[00:59:43.200 --> 00:59:49.680]
Big fan of the show he loves what we're doing. He loved those big numbers that we used to have once upon a time through the fall book anyway

[00:59:50.300 --> 00:59:50.300]
I

[00:59:51.400 --> 00:59:54.980]
Think fall is the operative word on this stage man, and it's like you know

[00:59:54.980 --> 00:59:59.260]
It's like everybody's jumping off the Titanic the only problem is nobody's got any life rafts. That's a problem

[00:59:59.980 --> 01:00:04.100]
A thousand six votes on a full one oh oh six baby we done it

[01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:10.200]
I think we ought to have a repeat member last week when we did the 1500 votes on the show in one day

[01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:14.740]
In spite of Chris's a negative attitude about the whole thing I think we ought to like

[01:00:24.260 --> 01:00:26.900]
But not get too carried away because after all

[01:00:26.900 --> 01:00:29.140]
Thousand six votes ain't exactly no 1500

[01:00:29.860 --> 01:00:30.620]
The biggest name

[01:00:30.620 --> 01:00:42.600]
For those people who say size doesn't matter well it does of course I'm talking about the

[01:00:43.220 --> 01:00:49.900]
2007 Lincoln navigator out with a hundred and twenty eight cubic feet of cargo space and over 15 inches behind the third row

[01:00:49.900 --> 01:00:55.800]
State there's plenty of room for whatever you're carrying and because of the Lincoln you get the luxury and warranty

[01:00:55.800 --> 01:00:56.740]
You've come to expect

[01:00:56.740 --> 01:01:02.960]
Leeson the navigator for a really poor 99 a month for 39 months at South Florida's biggest Lincoln Mercury deer

[01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:06.120]
Pines Lincoln Mercury I-75 and Sheridan Street

[01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:07.820]
Being a mom with kids

[01:01:07.820 --> 01:01:09.480]
Carstie and Stroller

Morning. How are you?

Looks like it time for flipping I'd like to ask working

[01:05:30.820 --> 01:05:35.900]
Your vantage point does Jamie have a mole on his back

[01:05:36.820 --> 01:05:37.260]
Back up

[01:05:41.100 --> 01:05:50.920]
You'll never know how many agents died cause of your big

[01:05:52.460 --> 01:05:56.220]
With your back and roll

[01:05:58.920 --> 01:05:59.480]
Oh

[01:05:59.480 --> 01:06:03.700]
When you see yourself that Jamie you can ask why is

[01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:05.280]
Rhymes with

[01:06:06.760 --> 01:06:14.260]
Okay, 14 to lunar is that gambling lunatic bill Bennett commentary hypocritical right-winger and excuse me for the redundancy

[01:06:14.260 --> 01:06:16.300]
Okay, you know that would be a good poll to take

[01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:22.940]
Or your favorite redundancy hypocritical um religious nut. Oh, I think we've done something like that

[01:06:22.940 --> 01:06:28.760]
But that's fine. We can do that again. In fact religious nut is that just by itself. Right like one goes right redundant

[01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:34.100]
That's very good. I think we've done this quite this way. That's good. We have never done quite this way

[01:06:34.100 --> 01:06:39.100]
I'm not prepared to do it now. I mean until I can pile at least you know 50 or 100 degree all pile of

[01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:44.380]
Like bad radio bad south Florida radio boring sports talk

[01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:49.220]
Right there you go. There's the winter boring sports talk. I love it

[01:06:49.220 --> 01:06:52.740]
So what do you think about yeah, and also don't forget about him. Yeah

[01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:55.240]
And

[01:06:55.240 --> 01:06:59.640]
While we're at it by the way since you want to start with that what about uh Jimmy and Danny

[01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:02.640]
That's Jimmy and Danny. Yeah, what about them?

[01:07:03.220 --> 01:07:06.900]
Sounds great five six seven come on. Let's get away. I don't know if these people can do it

[01:07:06.900 --> 01:07:09.260]
We got another hour and four minutes to go before that

[01:07:09.260 --> 01:07:10.780]
All games being started and

[01:07:11.180 --> 01:07:16.120]
Farlands and the Astros is Jupiter at 1250. It's an exhibitionist game that no comfort buttons

[01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:18.360]
But at least we get to a lot of your real ice and roll

[01:07:18.360 --> 01:07:19.600]
I'm not a lot of

[01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:21.040]
Not a lot of this

[01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:26.840]
Yeah, that's what you're talking about. I enjoyed doing talk ups because you know when we start playing oldies on here pretty soon

[01:07:26.840 --> 01:07:31.660]
Now that'd be a good pull to take you if Neil played oldies every day would you still listen to the show

[01:07:31.660 --> 01:07:33.900]
No, no you would yeah

[01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:35.700]
Chris Wood

[01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:42.500]
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, well now you don't sound very enthusiastic about that come on take it up a notch

[01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:44.840]
Oh, of course. Yeah

[01:07:44.840 --> 01:07:47.440]
Ha ha ha ha ha

[01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:55.080]
It was in 17 votes on a full and we still have only those same 237 dropouts on the streaming so that that was in early

[01:07:55.080 --> 01:07:59.460]
The fibrillary we had this morning, but it's Monday morning man. You don't want things to be working like

[01:08:00.140 --> 01:08:05.180]
Prime time fine and as wine on a Monday morning you want the usual QM screw ups

[01:08:05.880 --> 01:08:10.580]
I think if we can just arrange to have a lot more screw up like that we can get back up to at least maybe a two and a half

[01:08:10.580 --> 01:08:12.520]
Share or something on Monday morning

[01:08:13.240 --> 01:08:14.800]

[01:08:15.100 --> 01:08:15.520]

[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:50.920]

[01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:17.780]

I'm working on it and of course Jolly Joe since he likes you so much get those tapes ready boys

[01:09:34.440 --> 01:09:39.080]

[01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:54.000]
A few weeks ago I was driving my son to school late and we were listening to the program and he mentioned as you mentioned hockey and

[01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:58.120]
He coaxed me into taking him to a panther game he'd never been in the game before and

[01:09:59.020 --> 01:10:04.020]
After the game he said it was the most exciting sport he's ever witnessed now. He's crazy about hockey and he says to me

[01:10:04.020 --> 01:10:06.240]
He says I'm crazy about hockey. Thanks to Neil Rogers

[01:10:07.020 --> 01:10:11.800]
There you go. I'm the guy that makes the hockey fans man look out all right look out

[01:10:13.860 --> 01:10:19.080]
All right, there was a call see I told you tell me all this crap don't take any more calls

[01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:23.140]
What would it show me without these great calls you quizzling you simple to new four hours?

[01:10:23.620 --> 01:10:25.440]
Yeah, that's right and some of the long

[01:10:28.200 --> 01:10:34.340]
Yeah, um, I like the things a lot. Yeah, let's sit in here to leave Stevie. Okay. There's uh who is that

[01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:41.300]
Ben Andres looks like to me. Oh, that's right. He's back in the AHL with a Marley's okay. You crank it up a little bit of Ben Benny boy

[01:10:44.340 --> 01:10:48.440]
And HL on the fly. Oh, then they boy they got these long breaks in there. Thank God we don't do that

[01:10:49.780 --> 01:10:53.580]
1020 to be votes on the pool. How are we doing there on the bottom? How are the bottom feeders doing? Huh

[01:10:54.060 --> 01:10:59.340]
Then be a good question to do on the pool one day in fact next time you do the show which my vacation is less than three weeks away

[01:10:59.340 --> 01:11:00.120]
Not that I'm counting

[01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:11.180]
102 three on the pool over the last 10 years and the question I was going to say what what could we do to improve that

[01:11:11.180 --> 01:11:14.260]
Morning show change the shape of that table you think that would do it

[01:11:15.060 --> 01:11:17.460]
No, or you think maybe change the people who are sitting at it

[01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:21.200]
Huh? Huh?

[01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:31.440]
103 over the last 10 years what which QAM uh what does it say what is QM's best morning show I can't even read it anymore

[01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:32.240]
So in coherent

[01:11:33.160 --> 01:11:37.140]
That's because I got a big challenge going on this week man. I didn't really I've got two challenges here

[01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:39.660]
The one with the phone and the ones with the mush

[01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:44.640]
I didn't realize what tremendous challenges the would both be where you'll see I will prevail

[01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:49.420]
Maybe like like my buddy says Anthony Kelly and okay the main man prevails. I will prevail. You'll see

[01:11:49.980 --> 01:11:51.400]
You believe me what

[01:11:54.700 --> 01:11:55.100]
Oh

[01:11:56.700 --> 01:12:01.280]
Man on a Monday no less to have challenges like that. I'll see. I'll do it my best. I can

[01:12:02.120 --> 01:12:02.600]
Valley

[01:12:03.640 --> 01:12:08.360]
1026 folks on the pool over the last 10 years what is QM's best morning show they all sucked

[01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:13.400]
232 what a grotesque deck. There's the man Barack Obama does he able to take you back

[01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:18.800]
He's got it man only he's I'm with Larry tonight Larry King with Barack Obama. Wait no red bone by the way

[01:12:19.660 --> 01:12:26.560]
He is the inspirational leader that this country's been waiting for for four he four years since November 22nd

[01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:29.560]
1963 when lbj had Kenby assassinated

[01:12:30.220 --> 01:12:30.960]
But anyway

[01:12:32.220 --> 01:12:36.340]
Since 1968 when the martin Luther King and the bobby Kenby got assassinated

[01:12:36.340 --> 01:12:42.640]
See that's one good thing about american the political scene man every generation or two along come some reading good dedicated person

[01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:48.520]
I want to do some good things and we kill them or somebody kills them and then they say oh it was a lone craze

[01:12:48.520 --> 01:12:49.540]
assassin a right

[01:12:51.460 --> 01:12:55.200]
I like when the Lee Harvey Oswald said don't call me pass the death of that was kind of cute

[01:12:57.100 --> 01:13:02.360]
1026 votes on the pool they all suck 232 those morning shows howard stir in 182 are they serious?

[01:13:04.220 --> 01:13:06.900]
And the fact that they liked it in spite of all those

[01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:10.960]
beats bleeps and bleep I mean you talk about it a company that

[01:13:11.380 --> 01:13:16.380]
ought to be being bars for an idea you know and they didn't ask anybody if you like that

[01:13:16.380 --> 01:13:20.260]
Anyway, stir in two of 182 for all 143

[01:13:20.920 --> 01:13:25.920]
The second first team dfo joros and gildi 137 the original first team 116

[01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:27.160]
Huh

[01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:34.600]
Hank 82 I hate this pool 68 6 and a half percent. That's not too bad. Moe and gildi 34

[01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:39.120]
34 for moe and gildi what that show is so oh my god

[01:13:39.960 --> 01:13:45.600]
And then Kenny and voe 18 they're just edging out dfo gildi the broad and the other guy with 14

[01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:49.220]
So Kenny and voe at the moment are just barely escaping last place

[01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:54.000]
On you know and I think these are all the morning shows for what last 600 years since qm's been on here

[01:13:56.140 --> 01:14:00.620]
So I think next time George is on which maybe like what day is that gonna be today

[01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:05.420]
Okay, see you bye. Well, no, I've only got like 57 minutes to go

[01:14:05.420 --> 01:14:09.220]
Do you think I would bail out with like an hour to go that would be good you would no, I would not

[01:14:09.220 --> 01:14:12.740]
Not me. I'm not gonna shirt my duty mr. I'm gonna tell you I was a Cub Scout

[01:14:12.740 --> 01:14:17.800]
I was a little pansy Cub Scout not not a boy scout. I was in the Cub Scouts. I said I

[01:14:18.360 --> 01:14:22.700]

[01:14:31.960 --> 01:14:35.000]
Sounds like we missed the party WQ a m hello

[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.960]
Q a m hello

[01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:44.440]
Me of you. Yes, thanks for introducing me to baseball now. I love balls. Yeah, okay good. Uh-huh sounds like it

[01:14:45.140 --> 01:14:49.260]
He plays mean chin balls what he's trying to say how to interpret form five six seven

[01:14:49.260 --> 01:14:54.620]
Yeah, this business with hockey, you know, like what what are you talking about? We got the panther is it right?

[01:14:54.740 --> 01:14:58.140]
And by the way, I'm not the you know got to start paying money for the next season tickets already

[01:14:58.140 --> 01:15:01.700]
At least they're not going around trying to get playoff a money from people this season

[01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:06.960]
And you want to know why because even though they've been winning some games here lately like eight five over the islanders the other night

[01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:09.840]
They're not gonna make the playoffs again for the eight thousandth year in a row

[01:15:11.380 --> 01:15:17.140]
And so and for once I'll give the organization a little bit of credit for that after ripping them and ask for that grotesque trade

[01:15:17.140 --> 01:15:23.320]
Where they gave away a rubberic to the long go for long gone Todd Routuzzi and for the human's to the injured for the rest of the year

[01:15:23.320 --> 01:15:27.520]
Alex all in fact that's the only reason they even within the shouting distance of a playoffs

[01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:32.660]
But it's because Alex all got injured and old eddies hold on his back up a little hockey top there for a guilty

[01:15:32.660 --> 01:15:34.400]
I don't know

[01:15:34.900 --> 01:15:40.120]
1335 votes on the pool a very pressure packed week little did I know when I got my ass out of the sector this morning

[01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:43.400]
I was going to be in this so much pressure this week. I've got the many

[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:47.980]
Things I got to take care. We have 1272 of friends on our my space page

[01:15:49.480 --> 01:15:50.900]
And you know I did yesterday

[01:15:52.720 --> 01:15:58.800]
What I went back to the very beginning you know how you can save on there like I forget how many you know how long they stay on there

[01:15:59.540 --> 01:16:03.980]
But I went back to way back in early January and I looked at all the different people that came on there to begin

[01:16:04.540 --> 01:16:08.760]
Some of whom are still around and many of whom I don't hear from anymore like

[01:16:09.220 --> 01:16:11.200]
Zertek or whatever that guy's name is you know and

[01:16:12.040 --> 01:16:16.840]
Harry Potter and I guess I guess with a lot of people on these things. It's kind of like a

[01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:24.720]
At large you know, we can fancy yeah like a fleeting thing and they're like oh genius and the interesting thing is virtually all these people are

[01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:30.260]
Responded to you know and then they were a couple of people life shocked like oh my and there were so many nice people

[01:16:30.260 --> 01:16:36.700]
So I'm I'm 24 now and I've been listening since I was 14 or I'm 36 and I've been listening to for 20 years stuff like that

[01:16:39.140 --> 01:16:42.560]
Makes me feel like a part of their lives. You know, I mean doesn't it sound like emotional?

[01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:52.060]
It's good. It's not good. No more a mush mister. This is pretty quick. Whenever I shape my ball. I listen to the Neil Rogers 12-1 hour

[01:16:55.220 --> 01:16:59.620]
And now live from ride Joe 7. It's the Neil Rogers show

[01:17:03.820 --> 01:17:04.560]
Oh

[01:17:04.560 --> 01:17:07.360]
I like the keys on the song for the writing

[01:17:07.860 --> 01:17:11.240]
The deal time likely about Rick and Pysings

[01:17:11.240 --> 01:17:14.520]
Now when he guides all I don't send off key

[01:17:14.520 --> 01:17:16.240]
This is my favorite

[01:17:16.240 --> 01:17:17.580]
A carryoke

[01:17:18.420 --> 01:17:21.340]
Yeah, I love the way that I've been ended

[01:17:22.100 --> 01:17:24.780]
The bitch haven't been the same since

[01:17:25.340 --> 01:17:30.340]
Go cut by and died. I know. Yeah, I had that was some party quick read through

[01:17:30.860 --> 01:17:33.060]
But think I didn't go much advancing

[01:17:33.580 --> 01:17:39.380]
Of course it's not easy flying back there from ride Joe 7. I know thank god

[01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:40.740]
I'm here

[01:17:41.940 --> 01:17:46.440]
It's all over for you push left stuck on earth. Yes, president. No, well

[01:17:46.440 --> 01:17:51.800]
If you're lucky that crack head is the last bus to rig an election who's on this line?

[01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:57.140]
W. Do I am mr. Rogers speaking I was in the public sugarlactica today

[01:17:57.140 --> 01:17:57.900]
sir

[01:17:58.760 --> 01:18:04.160]
And let me tell you the clip out coupons in Thursday's paper are they're shaving?

[01:18:04.440 --> 01:18:06.560]
I discovered to my show. No, it's

[01:18:06.560 --> 01:18:08.600]
Rare finals

[01:18:10.040 --> 01:18:13.800]
Two for 99 cents on the contrary got them off

[01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:17.140]
Two brake stones for 99 cents

[01:18:18.060 --> 01:18:24.160]
Now I don't know about you. That's right. You've had me two brake stones for the price of two brake stones

[01:18:24.160 --> 01:18:27.480]
When the coupon clearly stated

[01:18:27.480 --> 01:18:30.640]
Well, use the cottage cheese that's grown in your toenails

[01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:33.620]
Now who's this line 7 and 9?

[01:18:34.360 --> 01:18:37.760]
Klingon penal colony. Hello. I forgot into three tires

[01:18:39.020 --> 01:18:45.300]
Okay, I'm not now. You know, I got a renegotiate my contract about a one-minute show, huh?

[01:18:45.820 --> 01:18:49.760]
You can fill the other three minutes. That's right. Boy, oh, can't you behind his next

[01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:52.340]
George bye bye bye

[01:18:53.780 --> 01:18:57.620]
Well, I'll talk about it. It's my favorite trouble too. Don't tell me we're out of here in 48 minutes

[01:18:58.680 --> 01:19:03.780]
Wanted to service to our loyal audience out there, you know to our vast loyal audience that we are used to have

[01:19:04.780 --> 01:19:10.180]
I remember those salad days man. I'd rather have the steak days myself. You can get the salad. I'll take this thread

[01:19:10.180 --> 01:19:11.400]
When I speak juicy

[01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:12.980]
Shack up on the wrong

[01:19:22.280 --> 01:19:27.040]
See I thought if I start playing us now the logging work come on. Oh, it didn't no

[01:19:27.040 --> 01:19:29.180]
Oh, geez

[01:19:29.880 --> 01:19:33.300]
We got a thousand fifty six folks. I think I could be wrong

[01:19:33.300 --> 01:19:38.540]
I could be wrong about this Chris. I'm trying to get Chris's attention because he's not uh

[01:19:38.540 --> 01:19:40.880]
I think it's hard to think

[01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:47.600]
I know or do you think we can make 1100 by ballgame time by 1250 47 more. I would do that in

[01:19:48.720 --> 01:19:49.600]
47 minutes

[01:19:50.780 --> 01:19:58.140]
Do the math is is it that that's another expression that I hate oh do the math my ass man do the man. I'll go get a cocka later

[01:20:02.780 --> 01:20:05.840]
Really and I know the perfect place to buy one of those

[01:20:08.340 --> 01:20:14.580]
You know what else you can buy there. Well, just forget about it. Well, don't don't answer it. Please please. What please pretty please

[01:20:15.180 --> 01:20:15.540]
Okay

[01:20:16.680 --> 01:20:20.940]
You know actually I think I think this is I don't think I'm gonna read anymore bedtime stories

[01:20:20.940 --> 01:20:28.580]
I mean yeah, what did I read I read well the one about you know the pot for Jesus or whatever was uh

[01:20:28.580 --> 01:20:30.360]
Bung, uh, Bung hits for Jesus

[01:20:31.320 --> 01:20:32.060]
That was good

[01:20:33.700 --> 01:20:34.100]
Right

[01:20:34.560 --> 01:20:38.820]
It was great what he taught you sensational. Yeah, I mean now two or three like that

[01:20:38.820 --> 01:20:42.320]
But I think these great calls today really inspired a hell out of me

[01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:46.060]
I think it's reverse psychology. What's better than this

[01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:50.420]
And then we got I forget what Ellie said, but it must have been really a phenomenal

[01:20:50.420 --> 01:20:52.580]
We had the one good one there. What did you say?

[01:20:55.380 --> 01:21:00.280]
You know, I don't want to say I don't want to make fun because it's a horrible thing. You know old-timers disease

[01:21:01.520 --> 01:21:01.880]
and

[01:21:01.880 --> 01:21:07.560]
But I've been doing this for years and years, but every now and then I get a little bit panicky like I'll get off out of the living room

[01:21:07.560 --> 01:21:10.680]
And I'll go like into the end of my bedroom to get something, you know

[01:21:11.200 --> 01:21:16.640]
Like I'll open up a drawer and I'll think to myself. What did I come in here for you know all the time? Everybody does that

[01:21:16.640 --> 01:21:18.060]
Sure, those are the

[01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:22.500]
Right especially those who are like doing Bung hits for Jesus every minute on the minute

[01:21:22.960 --> 01:21:27.740]
So you have to go back to where you were to remember what it was. Yeah, that's right. You sit down and think uh what or like

[01:21:27.740 --> 01:21:33.720]
The other day yesterday I was in the in Rexall in the drugstore and I walked in it specifically to get something

[01:21:33.720 --> 01:21:41.500]
I thought okay, what did I come in here to get memory pills? I think I need to put a flower and 10 on my head that'll help

[01:21:43.140 --> 01:21:44.080]
WQ a.m. Hello

You guys are talking about this thing going on with Joe. It wasn't the Joe the other day and

[01:22:12.460 --> 01:22:16.960]
When he said that that red bone nonsense and I you know, he talks I've heard him talk about it

[01:22:16.960 --> 01:22:22.160]
So I thought I just heard him ask some of the the African American black whatever you want to call him

[01:22:22.780 --> 01:22:28.200]
Player you know, yeah, what do you prefer and I never never heard any big deal about it and

[01:22:28.780 --> 01:22:34.700]
This is dude for it's just this is the same lawyer who's being a PIA with everyone else and monitoring everybody's morning show

Yes, including this show for 20 years. Yeah, freaking moron. What are you gonna life and do something

[01:22:39.720 --> 01:22:42.100]
Constructive with it man like put a bullet in this brain or something

[01:22:43.140 --> 01:22:45.800]
Okay, good one five six seven oh five sixty

[01:22:46.320 --> 01:22:51.240]
Good. We ended up at the same time. I'm sure and pound five sixty and leave horizon singular wireless line

[01:22:51.240 --> 01:22:53.360]
Not that that was a setup call or anything like that

[01:22:54.020 --> 01:23:00.120]
1060 man the thousand sixty votes on the pool. We need 40 votes in 44 minutes. Oh easy man easy

[01:23:00.120 --> 01:23:03.480]
Even I can do that trust me what I tell you or not as a case maybe

[01:23:03.960 --> 01:23:05.120]
Trust me when I try to do

[01:23:14.560 --> 01:23:19.860]
But the best is when Frankie Pantangeli was trying to get the band to play some Italian thing remember that he started to

[01:23:19.860 --> 01:23:24.540]
Yankee dude or whatever the way the pie that's right pop goes the weasel very good

[01:23:25.280 --> 01:23:28.600]
I'm gonna have to dig out some of that Frankie Pantangeli again if I could find it

[01:23:28.600 --> 01:23:31.680]
I don't want to play the same stuff again. Huh? That's okay

[01:23:32.500 --> 01:23:36.420]
Frankie you know my father did business with Ivan Roth he was

[01:23:36.420 --> 01:23:40.780]
Your father did business with Ivan Roth he'll follow me

[01:23:41.880 --> 01:23:47.340]
But you father never trust him right and your mom. That's another story so socks and hell

[01:23:48.300 --> 01:23:49.420]
WDQ I am hello

[01:23:50.680 --> 01:23:51.520]
Okay, sir

[01:23:52.520 --> 01:23:58.400]
This weekend I'm peaking my living room and as I was waiting to put a second coat on it

[01:23:58.400 --> 01:24:03.160]
It kind of reminded me of listening to a cane game with shows of gaffy as I was waiting for that

[01:24:03.160 --> 01:24:06.340]
Right, it goes the drive. Uh-huh. Isn't that great?

[01:24:07.080 --> 01:24:08.180]
Yeah, it's the best

[01:24:09.680 --> 01:24:14.600]
Those numbers down to real smaller they're much more manageable when they get under a one you know when you get to have a big

[01:24:14.600 --> 01:24:17.740]
In front of it like point point three and point four stuff like that

[01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:21.380]
Which I'm sure when and Marlon's game comes on at 1250 this afternoon

[01:24:21.380 --> 01:24:27.480]
The dials are gonna be tuning from all over the estate from bureau beach to fort Myers in every place in between baby

[01:24:29.580 --> 01:24:33.980]
106 or let me refresh that thing because I don't want Chris to get all you know that defeatist kind of attitude

[01:24:33.980 --> 01:24:36.040]
Because that thing it gets to be contagious

[01:24:36.700 --> 01:24:37.100]
1065

[01:24:38.100 --> 01:24:41.540]
35 votes in 42 minutes. Can they do it?

[01:24:41.660 --> 01:24:43.800]
Why do I keep playing that cut over and over?

[01:24:43.800 --> 01:24:45.020]
Does it like it?

[01:24:47.680 --> 01:24:50.100]
Now jelly belly nilly is that a song about?

[01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:52.340]
Neil guy. I don't think I ever heard that

[01:24:52.840 --> 01:24:54.260]
jelly belly nilly

[01:24:54.920 --> 01:24:56.120]
She was kind of smelling

[01:25:00.820 --> 01:25:04.360]
Especially if you put jelly on your belly when you're naveled

[01:25:06.740 --> 01:25:08.380]
And busy miss Lizzie

[01:25:19.780 --> 01:25:20.500]
She really

[01:25:21.420 --> 01:25:21.780]
Welcome

[01:25:28.140 --> 01:25:32.800]
All right, they're in lurie. William is a little short-fat fatty come on. Let's play it a hundred times. You're up for the ball

[01:25:34.560 --> 01:25:35.680]
Everybody whistle along

Oh, tell me to cue IA

[01:25:42.880 --> 01:25:43.360]
Hello

[01:25:48.040 --> 01:25:48.520]
Speaking

[01:25:58.700 --> 01:26:02.440]
What let me do a couple of scenes you can share with me what is on

[01:26:15.880 --> 01:26:16.240]
That

[01:26:16.240 --> 01:26:17.520]
Tessio said it

[01:26:19.800 --> 01:26:22.040]
The package and it was a fish in a vest

[01:26:23.040 --> 01:26:28.920]
And he said it's an old-sacidian message it means look at the commensus said it is that it means look at bratsy sleeps with the fish

[01:26:28.920 --> 01:26:31.160]
I look at this here

[01:26:33.060 --> 01:26:38.080]
And commensuses it's an old-sacidian message it means look at bratsy. I don't know who said it and who cares? I think it was testing

[01:26:38.640 --> 01:26:45.360]
Well, let's argue about it. Let's have a big fight about you got it right there. I got what that dropped that line you've been playing it

[01:26:45.360 --> 01:26:51.900]
Look at bratsy sleeps with the fishes. Yeah, you got to be kidding me. Look at bratsy sleeps with the fish. I told you it's commenza

[01:26:51.900 --> 01:26:56.460]
Commenza that's commenza that's commenza. I don't like voice anywhere. It's commenza. It's commenza

[01:26:56.460 --> 01:27:04.980]
Look at bratsy sleeps with the fish. See Tessio opens up the the package so to speak can I say come like this here now the morning that you play it? Yeah

[01:27:04.980 --> 01:27:05.040]
Yeah

[01:27:07.160 --> 01:27:08.300]
Just like jack lemon

[01:27:10.780 --> 01:27:15.840]
Now what which one I don't even know what that drop in is which one the one that took lemon to the button

[01:27:15.840 --> 01:27:20.460]
Oh, play a push the button Maxon. Who do you always say it is? I thought it was keen in my ass

[01:47:48.460 --> 01:47:54.360]
Because he's got to be at least 120 now and if you saw him on TV you'd say oh, I don't think he looks like he's still alive

[01:47:54.360 --> 01:47:56.560]
Maybe on the men maybe online it looks like he you know

[01:47:57.380 --> 01:47:59.580]
But he don't look like he's still alive 85

[01:48:01.240 --> 01:48:07.420]
He's one he's eighty five so peppered like 1921 that inspires me man when I when I see that a guy like him

[01:48:07.420 --> 01:48:13.600]
If 85 that means I got at least 21 years to go can you imagine how much aggravation I can dispense to in 21 years

[01:48:15.040 --> 01:48:16.200]
Oh here we go

[01:48:22.620 --> 01:48:23.900]

[01:52:22.040 --> 01:52:24.480]
I think Jim's got schooliosis

[01:52:24.980 --> 01:52:25.700]
QA in

[01:52:26.280 --> 01:52:28.000]
Uh, yeah, did you ever track down a sonic?

[01:52:28.980 --> 01:52:30.500]
Did I ever track it down?

[01:52:30.520 --> 01:52:31.840]
Yeah, it never was

[01:52:31.840 --> 01:52:34.140]
Yeah, friend of mine went there to

[01:52:34.140 --> 01:52:35.740]
Naples this weekend. He said it was great

[01:52:35.740 --> 01:52:37.460]
Yeah, there's no

[01:52:38.020 --> 01:52:39.860]
Down at homestead on us one

[01:52:39.860 --> 01:52:41.840]
There's what there's one down in

[01:52:41.840 --> 01:52:43.760]
Home no, there's not no, there's not

[01:52:43.760 --> 01:52:47.280]
Yeah, no again, there is no sonic

[01:52:47.880 --> 01:52:49.680]
On you are forming homestead

[01:52:49.680 --> 01:52:51.340]
Correct let me say it against the checkers

[01:52:51.340 --> 01:52:52.200]
It's not a sonic

[01:52:52.820 --> 01:52:54.860]
No, no, I'm pretty sure yet

[01:52:54.860 --> 01:52:56.760]
I'm sure how you're like

[01:52:56.760 --> 01:52:58.660]
I want to pay hours of you money

[01:52:58.660 --> 01:53:01.340]
There's no sonic in homestead

[01:53:01.340 --> 01:53:03.040]
Or anywhere within 50 miles of it, okay

[01:53:03.040 --> 01:53:04.720]
All right

[01:53:04.720 --> 01:53:06.300]
Ha ha ha ha

[01:53:06.300 --> 01:53:08.400]
You go down there, okay, Shmedrick?

[01:53:09.440 --> 01:53:11.980]
You go down there yonder and let's check out

[01:53:12.880 --> 01:53:14.180]
But it is in Naples though

[01:53:16.440 --> 01:53:19.060]
So you know if you got yeah a lot of time on your hands today

[01:53:19.060 --> 01:53:22.240]
I'd get on alligator Allie Sally and just sit on over there

[01:53:22.940 --> 01:53:25.180]
Had the Naples or maybe go to Orlando and find one

[01:53:25.180 --> 01:53:26.360]
Or maybe you want to go up to Tampa

[01:53:26.800 --> 01:53:28.740]
Now did we decide that there I know they're in Orlando

[01:53:28.740 --> 01:53:31.020]
Right and probably Tampa I think somebody

[01:53:31.020 --> 01:53:32.140]
I heard it was pretty good too

[01:53:32.140 --> 01:53:33.900]
Is the report I got from my corresponding

[01:53:33.900 --> 01:53:34.980]
Said was pretty damn good

[01:53:34.980 --> 01:53:37.020]
And the pizza joint over there is a little videos

[01:53:37.020 --> 01:53:38.740]
Which is your conical place in Naples

[01:53:38.740 --> 01:53:39.760]
That's pretty interesting

[01:53:39.760 --> 01:53:42.140]
When a bum fork town like Naples

[01:53:42.140 --> 01:53:43.840]
Has places like that

[01:53:43.840 --> 01:53:45.860]
And the brown kind of you see what I'm saying?

[01:53:46.120 --> 01:53:46.340]
I know

[01:53:46.340 --> 01:53:47.360]
It's embarrassing

[01:53:48.520 --> 01:53:49.700]
It's it's pathetic

[01:53:49.700 --> 01:53:50.700]
It is absolutely

[01:53:51.240 --> 01:53:51.980]
Acceptable and

[01:53:52.520 --> 01:53:53.260]
They leave them

[01:53:53.260 --> 01:53:54.640]
And that too is what it is

[01:53:55.240 --> 01:53:57.200]
Now I'm trying to remember the way this thing ends

[01:53:57.200 --> 01:53:58.700]
Because I don't want to like leave a lag

[01:53:58.700 --> 01:54:00.460]
Like a gap at the end of this you know

[01:54:01.440 --> 01:54:02.460]
That would be bad

[01:54:02.460 --> 01:54:05.020]
In fact let me let me just check out how can I do this

[01:54:05.800 --> 01:54:07.880]
I can go can I back it up a little

[01:54:07.880 --> 01:54:09.260]
Because remember the way it ends

[01:54:13.640 --> 01:54:14.080]
Good

[01:54:17.920 --> 01:54:20.640]
Okay now we have I got you covered if it should fall

[01:54:20.640 --> 01:54:22.500]
Shit and now there's no sweatsky okay

[01:54:22.500 --> 01:54:23.660]
All right

[01:54:24.680 --> 01:54:27.240]
According to Gretzky there's no sweatsky

[01:54:27.240 --> 01:54:28.340]
A new needle nose

[01:54:28.340 --> 01:54:29.060]
Noodle nose

[01:54:30.200 --> 01:54:31.520]
Don't be called no uh

[01:54:31.520 --> 01:54:33.400]
That's a tanning guy no noodle nose

[01:54:34.500 --> 01:54:35.940]
Because the nose knows

[01:54:38.280 --> 01:54:40.860]
And you remember what Clemens said okay

[01:54:42.500 --> 01:54:43.100]
Clemens

[01:54:43.100 --> 01:54:44.680]
What do you say

[01:54:44.680 --> 01:54:45.400]
Look at brushes

[01:54:45.400 --> 01:54:46.400]
These little fishes

[01:54:46.400 --> 01:54:47.380]
That sounds like

[01:54:48.020 --> 01:54:49.080]
Clemens says here

[01:54:49.080 --> 01:54:50.360]
Well there's a way to do that

[01:54:50.360 --> 01:54:51.100]
I will bet you

[01:54:51.780 --> 01:54:52.900]
$40,000

[01:54:52.900 --> 01:54:55.740]
$5,000 Sonic burgers against your stupid little ass

[01:54:55.740 --> 01:54:57.560]
I'll bet you there's no chance

[01:54:57.560 --> 01:54:58.480]
Look at brushes

[01:54:58.480 --> 01:54:59.360]
These little fishes

[01:54:59.360 --> 01:55:01.040]
That's the best you can tell us Clemens

[01:55:01.040 --> 01:55:04.660]
That's the best you can tell us Clemens

[01:55:04.660 --> 01:55:05.160]
Look at brushes

[01:55:05.160 --> 01:55:06.060]
These little fishes

[01:55:06.620 --> 01:55:07.580]
You're crazy

[01:55:07.580 --> 01:55:08.600]
I'm telling you

[01:55:08.600 --> 01:55:09.540]
You're crazy person

[01:55:09.540 --> 01:55:10.640]
Should have flipped it online

[01:55:10.640 --> 01:55:11.940]
Oh get away

[01:55:12.440 --> 01:55:13.480]
Hands you on my ass

[01:55:13.480 --> 01:55:14.200]
Look at brushes

[01:55:14.200 --> 01:55:14.980]
These little fishes

[01:55:14.980 --> 01:55:16.300]
Grazzy can you can you tell away

[01:55:16.300 --> 01:55:17.680]
He talks with a thick uh

[01:55:17.680 --> 01:55:18.340]

[01:55:25.580 --> 01:55:26.540]
Look at brushes

[01:55:26.540 --> 01:55:27.580]
These little fishes

[01:55:27.580 --> 01:55:28.640]
Look at brushes

[01:55:28.640 --> 01:55:29.740]
These little fishes

[01:55:29.740 --> 01:55:30.980]
Maybe you're asking me to

[01:55:31.560 --> 01:55:32.760]
Look at brushes

[01:55:32.760 --> 01:55:32.940]
Look at brushes

[01:55:32.940 --> 01:55:33.620]
These little fishes

[01:55:33.620 --> 01:55:34.340]
She's saying it to you

[01:55:34.340 --> 01:55:34.680]
Brush

[01:55:34.680 --> 01:55:35.780]
These little fishes

[01:55:35.780 --> 01:55:36.940]
Look at brushes

[01:55:36.940 --> 01:55:37.900]
These little fishes

[01:55:37.900 --> 01:55:39.000]
Look at brushes

[01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:39.920]
These little fishes

[01:55:39.920 --> 01:55:40.780]
And so does the audience

[01:55:40.780 --> 01:55:42.380]
Cause we got the marlins in the astros

[01:55:42.380 --> 01:55:43.540]
From Jupiter coming up next

[01:55:43.540 --> 01:55:44.360]
Oh man

[01:55:45.400 --> 01:55:47.100]
Well you can get used to this

[01:55:47.100 --> 01:55:47.700]
You know what

[01:55:50.060 --> 01:55:51.220]
This thing went by like

[01:55:51.220 --> 01:55:52.960]
We're sliding on a downhill slide

[01:55:54.700 --> 01:55:55.340]
Didn't it?

[01:55:55.680 --> 01:55:56.200]
Oh yeah

[01:55:56.880 --> 01:55:58.460]
Kind of like the numbers on this station

[01:55:59.160 --> 01:55:59.940]
1123 man

[01:56:00.860 --> 01:56:01.260]
1123

[01:56:01.260 --> 01:56:03.420]
I used to live at 123

[01:56:03.420 --> 01:56:04.960]
Varena Drive in Rochester, New York

[01:56:04.960 --> 01:56:05.520]
How do you like that?

[01:56:05.680 --> 01:56:07.000]
Is that a memory or what huh?

[01:56:07.840 --> 01:56:08.980]
How many years ago that was

[01:56:08.980 --> 01:56:10.700]
About 30,000 years ago

[01:56:10.700 --> 01:56:11.840]
About 30 man

[01:56:11.840 --> 01:56:12.280]
That's right

[01:56:12.760 --> 01:56:14.560]
123 Varena Drive in Brighton

[01:56:14.560 --> 01:56:16.740]
Not too far from the 12 corners there

[01:56:16.740 --> 01:56:17.680]
I'm on my rabbitling the

[01:56:17.680 --> 01:56:18.780]
Elm whatever the hell I was

[01:56:20.020 --> 01:56:21.580]
Is that of any interest to you

[01:56:21.580 --> 01:56:23.080]
If you're writing like my autobiography

[01:56:23.080 --> 01:56:24.900]
How can you be writing it if it's my auto value

[01:56:25.700 --> 01:56:27.100]
You know where you write it

[01:56:27.640 --> 01:56:28.540]
Near your auto

[01:56:28.540 --> 01:56:29.460]
Oh

[01:56:30.440 --> 01:56:30.920]
Auto

[01:56:32.320 --> 01:56:35.460]
Don't forget hangs come out after the game 80k 7 o'clock tonight

Lots more like 50,000

[01:56:43.940 --> 01:56:45.840]
Look at brushy sleeves with the fishes

[01:56:45.840 --> 01:56:47.900]
Look at brushy sleeves with the fishes

[01:56:47.900 --> 01:56:50.000]
Look at brushy sleeves with the fishes

[01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.060]
Look at brushy sleeves with the fishes

[01:56:53.080 --> 01:56:53.080]

[01:56:58.040 --> 01:57:00.440]
We did it
