[00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:02.000]
New...

[00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:03.060]
Yeah!

[00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:03.840]
Oh my god!

[00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:10.700]
Highly set, sir, and watered down.

[00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.560]
The worst punishment all of that is mine!

[00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.140]
The worst punishment is the worst punishment I've said!

[00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:21.640]
The worst punishment is both me and the gun's kids from dead!

[00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:29.680]
The right way nuts won't you throw sectors from ourselves?

[00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:35.640]
You're gonna watch what you say you better or else!

[00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.440]
You're the same, you're the same!

[00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.640]
The worst punishment is all monetary, every mortgage!

[00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.060]
I'm a bottom girl, I'll stay and fight you!

[00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.360]
Why do they say this?

[00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.660]
Come on, please, please!

[00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.320]
I hear my order, you'll get dismissed!

[00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:04.000]
I hear my order, you'll get dismissed!

[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.300]
I'm using any mortgage, language, by the power of the enemy!

[00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.280]
And our lord, God pushed the federal education division!

[00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.460]
And my problem's being a cycle, I'll fight you!

[00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.880]
The worst punishment is all monetary, every mortgage!

[00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.540]
The worst punishment is both me and the gun's kids from dead!

[00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.720]
The worst punishment is both me and the gun's kids from dead!

[00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.300]
10 out of 2 at 5.60 every QM, happy your Wednesday to it!

[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.520]
No more woodland Wednesday, no moss baby!

[00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.460]
Ah, ah, not even the penny machines, the nickel machines, the two penny ones!

[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.920]
Not a teddy!

[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.820]
No moss, and you're giving me this crap this day, oh you'll be back, you'll be, no I won't!

[00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.240]
Well maybe you'll find something else.

[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:50.720]
What do you mean by that?

[00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.540]
Well, what do you mean by that?

[00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.720]
I'll find something else, like another hobby, like a diversion!

[00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:57.200]
Like a stand-to-like thing?

[00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:59.700]
Like a perversion!

[00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:00.880]
Like bird watching!

[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.520]
Sure!

[00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:02.180]
Like a bird watching?

[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.960]
Yeah, yeah, all depends on what kind of birds they are.

[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:06.320]
And what nest they're in?

[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:07.160]
Right!

[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.840]
And anyway, let's get serious now, okay, what's that kind of do with Ethan Skolnick?

[00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.920]
Evan Cohen, who's not related to Ethan Skolnick except me, we buy a distant Judaism,

[00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.540]
Ethan Cohen is to this afternoon, because the man of dogs off the rest of the week.

[00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.200]
Well, what a schedule, he's got a must-be really work like that, to almost never work.

[00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.020]
And my deal on that starts pretty soon as a matter of fact.

[00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:30.780]
That's why I'm here today.

[00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.660]
Yeah, what's today today?

[00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:34.820]
May, may, uh...

[00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:35.720]
About 30 men!

[00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.640]
So, Friday is June, uh, eluunadehunio.

[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.220]
Why do I keep doing the numbers in Espanol?

[00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:43.040]
That's really embarrassing.

[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.580]
What is that?

[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.900]
It's beginning glaze, beginning glaze, okay, come on, cut the crap.

[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.080]
No, pick it up, Bonnie.

[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:48.360]
Get those numbers out.

[00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.840]
No, eluunadehunio is on Friday, via Nace.

[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.320]
No, via Nace is Tuesday.

[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.960]
No, sorry.

[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.520]
No, you're right.

[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.360]
Just let me go through it, okay, martes, mericales, clevis, via Nace.

[00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.540]
Yeah.

[00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:00.660]
Soburo and domingo.

[00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.700]
Is that what I do, right?

[00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:02.320]
Yes, you did.

[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.980]
Okay, well, what a linguistic expert, man.

[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.620]
Anyway, Friday is June 1st, so, you know, well, couple weeks ago,

[00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.880]
and just after that vacation time, even less than two weeks.

[00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:13.340]
In fact, Georgia's on vacation next week,

[00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.780]
and Josh Cordis is going to kindly join us.

[00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.540]
Yes, he will.

[00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:17.320]
Or unkindly.

[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.780]
He has a friend of mine.

[00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:18.660]
Or on the side of the day.

[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.920]
Probably be bitching about.

[00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.740]
What was he bitching about the other day when he was in there?

[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:22.480]
Chris, something.

[00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:25.260]
Yeah, I don't remember.

[00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:26.720]
I don't forget what it was, so much.

[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:27.580]
You know, and we...

[00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:28.180]
Oh, and that's right.

[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.740]
He was all bent out of shape because he was afraid we wouldn't have any

[00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.680]
Marlon early games, but kind of like I looked at the schedule.

[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.120]

[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.380]
And the good news is, next Wednesday, a 1230 departure for us.

[00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:38.080]
I believe.

[00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:40.500]
Let's see.

[00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:42.540]
Let me make sure.

[00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:43.240]
One moment, please.

[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:44.980]
Where is it?

[00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:45.840]
Here it is.

[00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:47.000]
Here's your Marlon schedule.

[00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.500]
By the way, nobody cares about the Marlins.

[00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.400]
In this station loses their ass on those games.

[00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.260]
Another great business deal by the beastlies.

[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.900]
You know, the rest of us have to suffer from it?

[00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:55.220]
Because of the Marlins.

[00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.920]
No promotion.

[00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.500]
We got no money for promotion because we lose our ass on the Marlins.

[00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:59.160]
Well, you know what?

[00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.240]
We didn't make the deal, okay?

[00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.580]
And we sure as hell didn't decide to put those games on the middle of the day.

[00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:04.560]
Time when people are awake.

[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.860]
Anyway, 1230 will be the pregame show or 1235.

[00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:10.360]
Next Wednesday, June, L. C. Steyhunio.

[00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:12.140]
Wednesday.

[00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:13.400]
Against the brave snow less.

[00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:14.160]
Aunt Atlanta.

[00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:15.000]
Mm.

[00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:17.740]
But a horrible place to be.

[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:18.780]
Okay, so that's the deal.

[00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:22.380]
Josh Curtis will be in next week for George and in the following week like toward the ass end of the week.

[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:23.120]
I go on vacation.

[00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.700]
And when I come back, it's summer schedule.

[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.920]
I only have one thing to say about that.

[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.400]
Oh, right.

[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.500]
George, worst Monday, Wednesday and Friday.

[00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:31.080]
And I work only.

[00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.320]
Martace and Viernes.

[00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.920]
No.

[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:34.140]
No.

[00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:35.380]
Martace and Vemes.

[00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.720]
See.

[00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.820]
Oh, sorry.

[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.480]
Sorry.

[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:38.300]
Oh, that's right.

[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.100]
Joe, both of that I worked on Friday.

[00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:45.300]
But no, yeah, that's, that's Joe for, you know, when you have that much fat, it chokes off the circulation of your brain.

[00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:52.400]
See, at least some people have an excuse, you know, when you're that fat and the fat is like all the way up to your neck to your collarbone.

[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.920]
It's like, touch off the circulation of your head.

[00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.880]
That was fun.

[00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.840]
Sometimes you can't read the numbers right when they come up.

[00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:00.000]
Speaking of numbers, wait till you hear this.

[00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.080]
Whoever facts this in, thank you so much.

[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:19.180]
Records obtained from the Immigration Courts under the Freedom of Information Act show that only 0.0015% that's 15,000s, a 1% of the total number of cases filed by the US Department of Homeland Security or terrorism related.

[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:26.040]
Of course, despite the fact that the Bush administration continues asserting that it's the primary focus of the DHS, they're doing a heck of a job.

[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:38.520]
It reported that some of that by independent research group, the Trans-Action Records Action Theory House, track, found that in the last three years, there have been only 12 charges of terrorism out of 814,000 plus cases.

[00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:45.880]
Oh, that number, that 0.00, it's kind of like our number, 11 o'clock at night, and all the nighttime numbers for the Panther.

[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.180]
There's another good business to you.

[00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.680]
We love the Panthers, nobody cares, you know.

[00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:57.440]
Tonight's the ducks are going to take a two-nothing lead on the other one in the series, and if spokesman's going to share well, they're doing some dirty air stuff out there, dirty stuff.

[00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.400]
It's just a cry, maybe. No more BM.

[00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:12.540]
Anyway, this once again highlights the terrorist threat to America's vastly overhyped and is being used by a criminally controlled government as an excuse to police the world and foe that a domestic police state to crush any dissent amongst the American people.

[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.680]
This is on Steve Watson, office on info wars.net.

[00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:26.740]
The DHS claims it's focused on terrorism, well, that's not true, said David Burner-May, track spokesman told CNN, either the original terrorism or their terrible catching him either way is bad for all of us.

[00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:32.260]
Either way you look at it, it's bad for us. It's kind of like Joyce. No matter how you look at that bitch, she's bad for us.

[00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:35.420]
And speaking of Joyce, guess what I decided to play a little bit of this morning?

[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.840]
No more. Oh, just to make sure.

[00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:41.180]
Okay.

[00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:48.660]
Well, we were discussing again before the show this morning with us. We go through our DCS computer here and try to find entertaining stuff to play to entertain the audience out there.

[00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:52.800]
Every day, every minute of every day, there's less and less and less. You know what we're all here.

[00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:57.860]
When that music starts, when we start hitting the jingles and the music on here, don't ask why, jolly, do a bill.

[00:06:58.140 --> 00:06:59.220]
I'll take the money, okay?

[00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:04.200]
My contract doesn't say nothing about doing a talk show. It says the near Roger show. That's all it says.

[00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:06.120]
And you want to know why? Because I'm...

[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:06.920]
Bill, come on!

[00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:07.540]
Legendary.

[00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:14.200]
DHS spokesman Russ Nackie called the track report Il Conceivan said the group liked the grants from the DHS Misson.

[00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:19.280]
He said that by clamping down on all forms of immigration, DHS has made it difficult for terrorists to come to the US.

[00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:21.100]
And Lou Dobbs is smiling about it.

[00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:25.680]
He's a crazy person, by the way, Lou Dobbs. I hate to break the news to you. We used to rely on him for about four minutes.

[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:26.320]
Sure.

[00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:30.460]
He's always hated him like poison. He always started to say a couple of things that made sense and ripped bush in ass.

[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:32.300]
And then he got back on his immigration thing.

[00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:34.180]
Let's kill all these illegal aliens after all.

[00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:36.000]
He's not a crazy person. Why?

[00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:37.040]
I agree. It sounds good.

[00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:40.020]
What? Poor gas on them set them on fire.

[00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:40.240]
Okay.

[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:47.280]
Nackie's comments are clearly absurd as there are still millions of illegal immigrants pouring into the country of here and the borders remain wide open.

[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:50.580]
The very reason why there's currently a heated debate over total immigration reform.

[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:52.880]
Yeah, let's have amnesty. We won't call it amnesty.

[00:07:52.880 --> 00:08:00.140]
And then of course, once the word gets down the bonsai pipeline that there's amnesty, then you think we got millions poured across now, man.

[00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:01.520]
It's going to be unbelievable.

[00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:04.980]
There's going to be resilience pouring across that border.

[00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:10.600]
Because, you know, they need that cheap labor down there. Well, these are jobs that no one else will do. Whatever.

[00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:14.780]
I love this story about man arrested and cuffed after using $2 bills.

[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:19.640]
Some people fact in some really nifty stuff this morning already. Keep the facts as common boys and girls.

[00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:24.940]
Because what we got four hours, I don't know. What do you think about that music thing?

[00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:28.520]
What do you mean? What do I think about it? You know, I don't like that.

[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:31.020]
What you play music when you're on which I think is cheating.

[00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:31.580]
Sure.

[00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:32.880]
On those holiday shows.

[00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:34.020]
I took holidays.

[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:36.920]
How the holidays you can do whatever you want in fact, not this Friday?

[00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:37.980]
I pounded on the phone.

[00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:41.460]
I pump those lines. I beg for calls.

[00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:43.100]
I'm a JLW.

[00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:45.480]

Yes, do they?

[00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:37.080]
Yes, do they?

[00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:37.080]

[00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:37.080]

[00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:37.080]

[00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:37.080]

[00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:37.080]

[00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:37.080]

[00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:37.260]
Yes, do they?

[00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:38.920]
Yes, do they?

[00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:40.700]

[00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:45.520]
Yes, do they?

[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:48.500]
Yes, do they?

[00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:50.240]
Songway.

[00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:55.160]
Over the rainbow Juni Garland Room.

[00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:59.360]
beach near the beach near the beach near the beach near the beach near the beach near Tihaasal.

[00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:01.480]
orrheaenboko beach.

[00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:04.040]
Something that is a very prực that causes this object變an.

[00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:06.880]
She must have been psychic at times and decide that she knows the question.

[00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:09.160]
Itода time is not.

[00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:14.520]
She must have known that the rainbow flag was going to be left out.

[00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:17.060]
Tihaas outlines the question.

[00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:16.200]
I knew there had to be some reason.

[00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:17.680]
What would be the other reason?

[00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:19.580]
What? For Judy Garland?

[00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:21.780]
For gay people to be obsessed with Judy Garland.

[00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:23.860]
Broadway plays Broadway's musical.

[00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:26.100]
What would that be? That's it. Broadway? Yes.

[00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:29.620]
I see. Okay, let's take a look at that schedule today and see what we got.

[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:31.900]
I already gave it a skill. No, I started doing that and interrupted.

[00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:34.560]
That was not a good idea. Evan Cohen, 2-4 for the mad dog.

[00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:38.420]
I got sidetracked when I saw that Mr. Mandech is not working anymore this week.

[00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:39.620]
Shame on you, mad dog.

[00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:42.200]
Put your nose to the grindstone and get with it.

[00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:46.300]
Join the rest of us working for another week or two and then we'll all screw off all summer long.

[00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:48.120]
Right, Jolly Joe? Oh, it'll be great.

[00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:51.540]
Then we got the power hour with Hank and I do believe...

[00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:54.660]
Who's on with him? Is it Baradino or Dave Hyde? One of those losers.

[00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:56.240]
Another one who's stupid as sports writers.

[00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:59.940]
During the power hour. Just... We finally had a little bit of a number in there for it to 5-4 now.

[00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.780]
Clarence is making sure that we get that number down to a 1 or a 2.

[00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:06.240]
But put these horrible boring sports writers on there with the thumper.

[00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:08.940]
Hank Solo between a 5 and 7.

[00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:12.360]
Dolphins all access between 7 and 7-30.

[00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:13.640]
Only half hour that crack.

[00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:17.040]
Then you got the Marlon pregame at 7-30. Marlon's at the Cubs at 805.

[00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:20.220]
Any K with Game Night following the Marlon game, what a chore.

[00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:22.540]
The title of the fact in the church.

[00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:26.340]
Two canna vets.

[00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:30.140]
Our home and the the prayer.

[00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:35.260]
High falls and sea.

[00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:39.920]
Will not you earn your hand.

[00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:45.360]
With the shotguns, multiply our size.

[00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:49.220]
We reclaim your physical scene.

[00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:51.840]
If you leave it.

[00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:54.120]
lean to you.

[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.740]
The ground yard毛 wrapped,

[00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:58.380]
all blue feminine.

[00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:03.960]
Motherfucker screaming.

[00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:08.240]
Clear instead of threaming.

[00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:15.480]
Can you visit the hinders town?

[00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:45.460]
to me. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

[00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:15.440]
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:44.960]
So who's car with them? Can I do the pull or what? Who's car with them driving? Would you least want to be a passenger in? Let me click that thing in, it might be 790, but who the hell knows? Oh, 790, that would be bad because if I said 790, there would be like a Freudian suggestion and they turn over to that of Maxus New Yorker and hear him talk a lot of crap. 788 Rich Sanchez, that was my vote and look at that once again, I'm got my thumb right on it. Not only because he's a bad driver and dangerous and killed like I'm from the state, because it would be really bad company.

[00:14:46.340 --> 00:15:14.180]
Rich Sanchez, 219, Ted Kennedy, 150, but they sure won't let poor Teddy off the hook, will they even for all time's sake. Can't do it Teddy. Well, as he low-hand 104, he's got some issues. And you know what? Who gives a crap when you come right down? What is that? You said it. I said, stay and I'm with the player. What is it? Part of our new format over here, new music for you.

[00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:44.160]
Bad company. Oh, so low man. It's not a company. It's a start-slude over somewhere. I don't know the line. I was on the runnison. The music was on Pluto. Lindsey low-hand 104 is a respectable third. Bobby Brown 92, Paris Hilton 85. A lot of bad drivers out there in Hollywood. Mel Gibson 52, you Jew Bastard. Billy Joel 33, Brittany Spears 19. I got a Brittany story, but it's way, way down at the bottom of my pile. I'm going to tell you, when I have to start talking

[00:15:44.160 --> 00:16:14.080]
about Brittany again, that'll be time to hang this microphone up. I'll polish it off and hang it up in the corner and say, bye-bye. I think that's what I'll do the day when I finally decided, okay, I've had enough and I can't take no more of Fattas, Jolly Joe. I'll just come on one day and say, bye-bye. Like, John McLaughlin there on that awful show. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. And you'll just sit there. And you'll crack out the music, you know. That's right. And then you'll crack out those little areas under the Pope tapes. You'll see. I know.

[00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:43.200]
Well, Billy Joel 33, what's his issue? I forget, did he have a thing? I guess, I don't know. I think he had a thing, but I think it fell off. Brittany Spears 19, Nicole Richie 17, and David Hasselhoff 17, you talentless piece of third. They like him in Germany, though, because they like his name. Seven, look at that. The big chunk just came in here. We have seven ideas. What's going on here? Lately, huh? You think the audience is coming back now that we got rid of those stupid phone calls, 801? Boy, this is, this is, I think Chris has got the fix in on this.

[00:16:43.740 --> 00:17:13.180]
At the rate we're going out, we might have like a million votes by the end of the day. What do you think? No. If everybody votes a gazillion times, 801, that's pretty powerful. It's only 1022, damn it. And we're getting back to the sky with the $2 bills. And again, thanks for the facts this time. Robert. Robert. Robert. Email those. Not Robert Greeper. No, no. The Greeper, the Lord of the Bored. No, Palestinian killing, right? A whole of the ass. A man tried to faint. You know, I like that expression. The whole of the

[00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:42.940]
ass. Yeah, all of it. Now, is that an adjective or is that like a, yeah, it's the entire place? A man tried to pay a fee. A man tried to pay a fee. Well, you know, something that's, that's, uh, you got to have that. Otherwise, you're going to get all bound up. You know, your bound to a man tried to pay a fee using $2 bills. Was arrested handcuffed and taken a jail after a clerksuit of best buys. So, by the way, you know, about Joyce, she bulls is what I'm here.

[00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:58.740]
That's what parents was telling everybody singing the hallway. Should go like that. It was just embarrassing. And then of course they told us we can't play it. He can sing it. We can't play it because corporate is, but I beat, but I'm put by him. Anyway, this guy was handcuffed, taken a jail after clerksuit of best buys.

[00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:07.220]
Do a question to current. He's legitimacy and call the police are these people stupid or what? Yes. According to an account of the Baltimore son 50 70 year old Mike,

[00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:16.380]
Bolesta were shocked to find himself taken the Baltimore County lock up in Kakai'sville, Maryland. That's, that's the name of the place. Okay. That's the name of the joint.

[00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:25.800]
Kakai'sville. Yeah, where was handcuffed for three hours while the US Secret Service was called into waiting on the case. They call the Secret Service because the guy was shopping with $2 bills.

[00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:34.820]
Bolesta told the son I'm six feet five inches tall and I felt like eight inches high to be handcuffed. I have all those people looking on to be cuffed to a pool.

[00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:41.420]
And to know he haven't done anything wrong and me with a brother Joe who's spent 33 years on the city police force. It was humiliating.

[00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:47.860]
After best by personnel reportedly told Bolesta he would not be charged for the installation of a stereo in his son's car.

[00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:59.940]
He received a call from the store saying it when fact was charging him a fee. As the means of protest, Bolesta decided to pay the $114 tab using 57 crisp new two dollar bills. I'll take them.

[00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:09.800]
As owner of the capital city student tears, the Baltimore residents got a hearty supply of the uncommon currency often gives the bills to students who take his tours for meal money.

[00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:20.780]
He's owner of the capital city student tours. I don't know what that has to do with $2 bills, but whatever, whatever. Maybe they cost $2 out of the kids. Don't see that many $2 bills. So they think this is the greatest thing in the world.

[00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:30.020]
Bolesta said they don't want to spend them. They want to save them. I've been doing this since I started the company since I'm thick and I'll stage my little comic protest. I'll pay the $114 with $2 bills.

[00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:39.860]
Bolesta explained what happened when he presented the bills to the cashier at Best Buy in February 20th. She looked at the $2 bills the cashier didn't told me. I don't have to take these if I don't want to.

[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:47.660]
I said if you don't, I'm leaving. I tried to pay my bill twice. You don't want these bills. So she took the money, like she's doing me some kind of an effing favor.

[00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:57.200]
Bolesta says the cashier marked each bill with a pen. Other store employees began to gather a few of them asking, are these real? They were talking about the bills. I see.

[00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:01.680]
Of course they are. Bolesta said they're legal tender. Oh, they're legal and they're tender.

[00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:09.460]
According to the Sun report, the police arrest report note that one employee noticed some smearing of ink on the bills. That's when the cops were caught.

[00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:15.760]
Some smearing of ink. One office of reporting must have bills ran in sequential order. Oh, that proves it to me.

[00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:16.180]
Yeah.

[00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:21.180]
Said, Bolesta, I told them I'm a tour operator. I've got thousands of these bills. I get them from my bank.

[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:25.200]
You got a problem called a bank. I'm sitting there in a chair. The store is full of people watching this.

[00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:30.420]
All of a sudden, he's standing me up and handcuffing me behind my back, telling me we'd have to do this till we get it straight and new.

[00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:36.260]
Meanwhile, everyone's looking at me. I've lived here 18 years. I'm hoping my kids don't walk in and see this.

[00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:40.720]
And I'm saying, I can't believe you're doing this. I'm paying with legal American money. You idiot. You...

[00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:41.340]
You're fairing.

[00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:47.180]
Bolesta was taken to the locker for he said handcuffed to a pool and in leg irons while the secret service was called.

[00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:49.360]
And at this point, he says, I'm a mass murderer.

[00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:55.680]
Secret service agent Lee Turner eventually robbed a trade of the bills of legitimate adding a quarterly police report.

[00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:59.740]
Sometimes ink on money can smear. And there's more to this, but we didn't get it.

[00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:05.060]
It says commenting on the incident. Baa, baa. And that was the end of it. It just chopped off there.

[00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:09.040]
Whoever thanks this in, thank you very much for your good job. Baa.

[00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:12.240]
Baa. Baa. Baa. Baa. Baa. Baa. Bui.

[00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:16.480]
So that takes here that's the art can say, Baa. Bui. Then we don't need to have any calls so that one of

[00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:18.880]
the Howard's sucklings can call it. Baa. Baa. Bui. Baa. Bui.

[00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:20.680]
Very clever and very amusing. Not.

[00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:24.380]
So how do you like that? Here's a guy trying to do the right thing. Pay the bill.

[00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:27.800]
And he's got two dollar bills and he's got to be punished for it. Yeah.

[00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:33.760]
It's a brave new world. Some kind of a murder or some kind of a freaking terrorist like my lesbian

[00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:35.780]
needs a cab driver. Freaky up low.

[00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:16.040]
1031 and 560 WQM. We got 825 vote already. Ricky Tiki Sanchez is killing a man.

[00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:19.020]
Wouldn't be the first time. You know that guy that he hidden from the state.

[00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:21.200]
He never had a vegetative state for a long time.

[00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:24.260]
Florida. Well, though I can't difference what state he's in after he's dead.

[00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:28.300]
And been dead for a long time. That's back when Ricky Tiki Sanchez was

[00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:32.120]
imbibing a little bit. I just went home to have a little of Drinky Poo and came back.

[00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:38.500]
And now he's on CNN peddling a lot of crap. Well, I've said that's America for you.

[00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:42.960]
The swirled that they passed off his news. No wonder nobody watches the news. Nobody reads a freaking

[00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:47.360]
newspaper. It's depressing. Who wants to be depressed? Stick with us and we'll talk about Joyce

[00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:51.560]
and the fact that she blew it. She blew it. We'll do that. In fact, I think we'll play that the

[00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:56.940]
whole show today. Good. I mean, we can't, you know, we can't play much of it, but we can just play

[00:22:56.940 --> 00:23:02.540]
that little bit over and over again. Let's do it. Let's do it.

[00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:08.460]
See, Trump and Theran, you start again. I can't, we can make a loop on that. What do you think?

[00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:13.400]
You can do about that. I mean, yeah, the code. Yeah, right. What do you ask?

[00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:26.920]
What do you mean? It doesn't say she blows all the way nose. It doesn't matter what it says or what it

[00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:31.220]
says. When did that legislation come down? If she's aware of it, the answer is no. Oh, that's

[00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:35.460]
right. If she knows about it, that's the rule. Okay. That's an OCC rule. If Joyce don't like it,

[00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:39.120]
you ain't playing it. You ain't saying it. You ain't doing it. That's the deal. And you know what

[00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:44.840]
she doesn't like? Anything. Right. Anything that we might say or do. That's correct. Bitch.

[00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:49.680]
Well, we can still do that so far. We haven't had a phone call from fat ass Jolly Jolly yet. So you

[00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:54.100]
can't call Joyce a bitch. Corporate subset. But you know, a corporate blows. Okay. Just like she does.

[00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:58.460]
Corporates a bunch of idiots. All these horrendous business deals. I'm so sick and tired hearing

[00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:02.820]
him whine about oh, they lost all the money on that marlins. They lost all the money on that. Well,

[00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:07.960]
too bad. Put for real on the air and put sterron right afterward to see if they can totally lose

[00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:11.560]
the license and give it a hell of a shot by the way. With her approval, no less over there. The

[00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:18.880]
brilliant that canceeery that she is. Bitch. Idiot. Lightweight. 833 votes on the pool. Who's

[00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:23.900]
car within driving? Would you least want to be a passenger in? Uh oh, WFOR show and two

[00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:30.560]
are men robbed. Brings truck in Miami. There's another wargreens. Check. Good news is no shots

[00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:35.260]
were fired. No one was injured. The robbers were able to run out of the store and remain on the

[00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:39.400]
loose. It was an accident. There may be some surveillance video of this. According to me,

[00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:43.140]
well, they may be. He sounds to be about what a whiny bitch he is. A lot of bitches out there.

[00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:48.060]
Rick San says he's a bitch. 231 votes he's got. He's killing a competition.

[00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:54.080]
Ted Kennedy 156. The ghost of Chapacquittacan, Mary Jo Keprekney just will not go away, huh? Poor Ted.

[00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:59.280]
He was just not having himself a wild time. Sure. It's the Kennedy way of life, man.

[00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:05.280]
Lindsay Lohan 113. She's vile. Bobby Brown 99. I don't think they come any viler than Bobby Brown.

[00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:10.200]
Paraselton 88. Oh, and now where is that? Which purple they're showing on there? Isn't that the dead

[00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:14.000]
Pope? Yeah. Parents of missing British girlized for prayers from the Pope. But they're showing

[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:19.860]
foul footage of the old dead Pope, the Slav on the slab. That big fat Tubby, see if the Pope is

[00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:23.900]
infallible and matters of faith in your Audiotic, he's supposed to be a pretty, you know,

[00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:27.680]
level-headed guy. He's supposed to know his craft. How can you have a fat Pope, you know?

[00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:29.880]
Right? They're having a fat talk show host.

[00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:37.860]
Lindsay Lohan 113. Bobby Brown 99. Paraselton 88. Mel Gibson 56. Hey Mel, happy Chihuahua's.

[00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:42.980]
You schmuck. Billy Joel 35. Britney Spears 19. David Hasselop 19.

[00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:45.800]
Bushland, Uberolus David. And Nicole Richie 17.

[00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:49.960]
It's really ironic how I love Germany so much. But then again, you know why I like it so much.

[00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:53.680]
Yes, I do. Well, you know, one of the reasons why I like it, that's just because there's so many

[00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:57.080]
pretty people there. I mean, that of course is part of it. Well, you have to go someplace where all

[00:25:57.080 --> 00:26:01.080]
the people are absolutely, you know, like South Florida. It's okay that you like German sausage.

[00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:03.920]
They have a lot of good things I understand.

[00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:07.700]
Hot brats.

[00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:08.220]
Mm-hmm.

[00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:13.460]
839 is what we got. I'm telling you, there's no stuff on this. Now, I think Chris has got some kind of a

[00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:17.760]
scan goal with this thing. Yeah, that's exactly what 840. There is another one. See that? Every time I hit

[00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:22.900]
that baby, it's just coming in and big juicy chunks. Speaking of a bratwurst.

[00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:28.160]
No, there's something about the country in Germany too. It's just it's a fabulous place. You don't

[00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:32.440]
know because you ain't been there anywhere. Right. Maybe Josh Cortis will send you there. Maybe.

[00:26:33.940 --> 00:26:38.200]
Since he's a sniff at around, he wants to go to Amsterdam and he wants to do this and he wants to say,

[00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:43.720]
yeah, good, go ahead on your dime, baby. It's all yours. And if your dog gets sick again, guess what?

[00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:49.680]
Zisco will take care of it. That's a Z-man. Let him. He loves, yeah, I mean, I love dogs, but I can't

[00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:53.540]
take care of everybody's dog that needs an operation. Can I? Although he had some of that money coming.

[00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:58.200]
Not necessarily at that time, but you know, you know, you know, me, I just, I got a big heart.

[00:26:58.900 --> 00:26:59.340]
Yes, you do.

[00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:04.140]
And Al, the new guy, he's a new, my space friend. I know we have 14. I don't know what we got.

[00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:09.460]
I wrote it down somewhere. 1417. That's pretty impressive. When we get to 2000, I'm going to kill myself.

[00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:15.160]
But anyway, oh, you watch him come in now over the weekend. But anyway, so he writes me this one in

[00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:19.000]
the first message. You're not nearing the end and your mother lived in the 80s and so were you,

[00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:24.420]
well, when did I say I was nearing the end, Al? Don't be a Yento, okay? First of all, my mother lived

[00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:29.440]
in 91 and my father lived in 90. So if it, if that's all it takes is just checking the genes thing.

[00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:34.280]
I mean, you know, that's, that's below me. I mean, that would be nice. I'd like to, I'd like to be

[00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:39.120]
on the year to 91. In fact, I'd like to make the last 25 or 26 years of it on some other station

[00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:42.840]
just ripped, well, I already am ripping them in ass that they deserve. I'm talking about real rip,

[00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:47.920]
really ripping and tearing and shredding and letting the truth come out of baby of the incompetence,

[00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:54.420]
the ineptitude, the stupidity, the ignorance, the blind, blind foolishness and, and all of these,

[00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:58.560]
all of these things. That will be on another station, you know, W-O-F-F.

[00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:03.700]
Maureen Dow says, how are animalistic in good ways and bad? Well, you know what they say, birds do

[00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:08.720]
it and bees do it and some people on their knees do it. Maureen says the odd thing is that

[00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:12.720]
conservatives wear pinstriped suits. They love the ancient so much that they should really be

[00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:16.800]
walking around in togas. The main contribution of the Greeks to modern American politics may have been

[00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:24.560]
Michael Newcoccus who once claimed the Acropolis in wingtips. But that doesn't stop conservatives,

[00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:28.540]
especially the Straussians who pushed her going into Iraq from being obsessed with ancient Greece

[00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:31.860]
and from believing that they are the successors could play dough in homework in terms of

[00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:36.120]
lofty ideals and ability and character in American politics while Democrats merely muck about

[00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:40.440]
with policies for the needy. Harvey Mansfield, a leading Straussian who taught political

[00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:44.820]
science at Harvard and who wrote a book called Mainlinus, he's for it, gave the Jefferson lecture

[00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:50.100]
recently at the National Endowment for the Humanities in Washington. It was an old as his book is

[00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:54.960]
to Thumos, the Greek word that means spiritiveness with flavors of ambition, pride and brute

[00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:59.700]
willfulness. Thumos, as Philip Kinnikot wrote in the Washington Post, is a word reinvented by

[00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:03.940]
conservative academics who need to put a fancy name on a political philosophy that boils down to

[00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:08.800]
boys will be boys. In his prepared remarks, Mr. Mansfield didn't mention the war, which is a

[00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:13.080]
downer at conclave of Neocons and Thumos worshipers, but he explained that Thumos is the

[00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:16.780]
birthplace of an animal in the face of a threat or possible threat. In Thumos, he said,

[00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:22.260]
we see the animality of man, four men, and especially males often behave like dogs barking, snakes,

[00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:27.780]
hissing, birds flapping, hissing and kissing, and something rhymes with that. But precisely here,

[00:29:27.820 --> 00:29:31.400]
we also see the humanity of the animal, human animal, because it's reacting for a reason,

[00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:37.640]
even for a principle, it causes only human beings to get angry. Never saw an angry dog. I see.

[00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:41.420]
If we're first to use an example, naturally, from ancient Greece to explain why politics should

[00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:46.660]
be about revolution rather than equilibrium. What did Achilles do when his ruler Agamemnon stole

[00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:50.700]
his slave girl? He raised the stakes. It asserted that the trouble was not in the law so alone,

[00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:54.780]
but in fact that the wrong sort of man was ruling the Greeks. Heroes released hemen like Achilles

[00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:59.580]
should be in charge rather than lesser beings like Agamemnon, whatever his name was, who have

[00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:03.240]
mainly their lineage to recommend them, and who therefore don't give hemen the honors they deserve.

[00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:07.940]
What about shemen? Achilles elevated a civil complaint concern. I heard a lot of the Greeks were

[00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:12.820]
Achilles elevated a civil complaint concerning a private wrong to a demand for a change of regime,

[00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:17.620]
a revolution in politics, Mr. Mansfield concluded the complaint of an injustice is an implicit claim to

[00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:22.280]
rule. The most recent example of the Hellenization of the Bush administration is the President's

[00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:26.620]
choice for war's are, Armand Lutendin General Douglas Lut, who says he loves the Greek military

[00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:31.200]
historian Thucydides. Well, I'm doing good with these names so far today. Well, they're Greek.

[00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:37.120]
Yeah, that's true. Other Thucydides, Ephesians, I was included, Victor Davis Hanson was the

[00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:41.100]
war guru to Dick Cheney when the vice president went to the bunker after 9-11 and got into his

[00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:47.100]
gloomy Hobzean phase. Hobze's biggest influence was also Thucydides. Donald Kagan respected the

[00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:50.800]
Hellhistor and was written authoritatively on the Peloponnesian Wars, the father of Robert Kagan,

[00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:55.660]
a Neocon who puts for the Iraq invasion and Frederick Kagan, a military historian who urged the

[00:30:55.660 --> 00:31:00.480]
surge. I call Professor Kagan to ask him if Thucydides, the master of chronicling hubris and

[00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:03.900]
imperial overreaching, might provide the new wars are with any wisdom that can help America

[00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:07.560]
so through the morassia of Iraq. Very much his son's father, the classist,

[00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:11.420]
and said he was disgusted that the White House, after a fiasco vernacular painting designed by

[00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:15.960]
Rumi, is still doing one dumb thing after another by appointing General Lut, a chief skeptic of the

[00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:21.120]
surge. Professor Kagan said in one reason the Athenians ended up losing the war was because in

[00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:26.520]
the Battle of Matinia and 418 BC against the Spartans, they said a very inferior force and had a

[00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:29.600]
general a command who was associated with the faction that was against the aggressive policy

[00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:34.040]
against the Spartans from Michigan State. Kindly President Bush appointing the scythe

[00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:37.620]
one the war whose strategy is opposed to the surge he said, Drowey, with gold realism,

[00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:42.180]
Thucydides captured the Athenian philosophy in the 2070s, where they led its downfall as a gold

[00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:46.640]
in democracy. The strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must. What message can we

[00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:50.740]
take away from Thucydides from modern times? To me, Professor Kagan said the deepest message,

[00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:55.660]
the most tragic, is his picture of civilization is a very thin veneer. When you punch a hole in it,

[00:31:55.660 --> 00:31:59.340]
what you find underneath is hollow, the pre-civilized characteristics of the human race,

[00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:04.300]
animalistic in the worst possible way. Compared to a raq the Peloponnesian war was a

[00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:10.060]
cakewalk, says marine, the queen. Well she tried to screw me up today boy, with every big

[00:32:10.060 --> 00:32:15.220]
Greek damn movement and I got through them all. Nice goal man, nice going. Still got it,

[00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:19.460]
we don't know what it is, but you still got it and I'm trying to get rid of it. 861 and a

[00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:23.020]
poor boy Chris is just now how about Charha today, do you get a little taken care of?

[00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:26.480]
We got a little taken care of. Not much though huh? Just fine.

[00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:29.180]
It's here when I tell me the Grupper fingers crap again, I'm going to like

[00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:35.200]
I've never said Grupper fingers. Have you said chicken fingers? Chicken fingers. Right. Grupper

[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:53.000]
fingers was from Howe's for a while there. No I see. How about Grupper fingers? That's

[00:32:53.000 --> 00:33:02.560]
called. You're fairies. I see. Those blue light-bulbin over me seems my blood I've got

[00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:15.160]
all. Contents. Was not where it was supposed to be. No I could dead wall. I stayed alive.

[00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:26.920]
Impossible that was for me. My breath stinks so bad. We so bad. We so bad.

[00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:35.940]
I got a quick drive and smashed it in my car. We've heard it smashed it in my car. We've heard it smashed it in my car.

[00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:45.440]
My breath is smashed in my car. And it essentially I come. It's a good time to stop. Stop

[00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:50.100]
riding smashed in my car. You'll put him on there too Nick Carter. What do you say? Everybody's

[00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:53.840]
forgotten about him but nevertheless some people probably would like to be in the car when they're

[00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:57.860]
driving whether he's driving. In fact maybe hopefully a little bit tipsy. Like the voicemail check

[00:33:57.860 --> 00:34:04.720]
wasn't that about Nick Carter? Or do I was going to play? Farth sounds anymore. You'll have to stop.

[00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:10.580]
But now you threw me off. That's under a two-foot. Okay I was in the car that half an hour go listening to you.

[00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:15.460]
First of all Nick Carter has more talent than his right code than you will ever have. And he's not a

[00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:21.160]
pineapple head. You're a stupid fat bag. Oh Farth sounds. See I can walk in shoe-dum with the same

[00:34:21.160 --> 00:34:26.260]
time. I can get that in there. Actually Nick is a little chubby himself. Maybe he's a kind of a

[00:34:26.260 --> 00:34:30.820]
not fat but chubby bag. Nick Carter. What do we got in there? I mean you've got to be deafed

[00:34:30.820 --> 00:34:35.220]
and blind not to pick that up. I mean give me yeah I wouldn't pick it up. Not at this stage.

[00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:41.120]
Well not at this stage of things is probably well used. 883 votes on it. Pull and Nick Carter just

[00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:46.340]
went on there and already he's got no votes. You think this crowd gives a crap about Nick Carter

[00:34:46.340 --> 00:34:51.320]
and the backstreet boys huh? No. Nick Lachet they my Kiribati. I know. I sure is he'll do. What?

[00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:56.980]
They don't? And Jessica Simpson? Yes. She's always a difference there. Like you're just talking

[00:34:56.980 --> 00:35:00.860]
about from your own perspective. I got news for you. He's got more talent in his middle finger

[00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:04.900]
than she's gotten her ass. That's funny. That's why he can't get a job and she can't not.

[00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:10.220]
He can't get hired. Anyway. He can't get hired. He can't get hired anywhere.

[00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:15.020]
That was part of the problem about why the marriage fell apart. He was jealous. He was having all

[00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:26.960]
these offers and concerts and doing movies and he couldn't get hired. He was the dogs and the

[00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:31.700]
Oh man. Not that you're pretty good at standing back. Right. Let me say again. He's great. He can

[00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:35.620]
he could sing in my group any day of the way. I don't have it all back. He could be in my group

[00:35:35.620 --> 00:35:39.280]
group any day. Doesn't even have to carry a tune. Does he? He can carry something. I know.

[00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:45.460]
America, they're not so beautiful. I guess who wrote this? Doug Thompson, man. He has really

[00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:50.000]
good on Capitol Hill Blue. He's I don't know if he's the best but he's sure right in there. I love him.

[00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:55.880]
He gets pissed off and fired up, man. We need to have him come to QAM. He'd straighten some ass out.

[00:35:55.880 --> 00:36:00.460]
Let me tell you right now. He takes some of these bastards even at Fat Ass Jolly Joe and he'd show

[00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:04.780]
him what for. He'd knock his ass into the corner of the room and kick him or he'd stop on him a

[00:36:04.780 --> 00:36:09.460]
couple of times. He'd do the Bristol stop. America, they're not so beautifully rights today.

[00:36:11.020 --> 00:36:14.400]
As the nation, we have a long tradition of screwing things up, Doug says. It might be our

[00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:18.260]
certain use of slaves. The outright theft of land from Native Americans and tremendous Japanese

[00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:24.760]
Americans and gravity of W.2. What was that? What was Bristol stop? Is that the one by the Dove House?

[00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:29.840]
Of course. Well, there was an original one. The Dove House didn't have the original. This is

[00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:34.000]
an important article and you're punching around with music now. I think starting after 11 o'clock

[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:38.680]
was another one of the music format. Show that sure is the thing or two. In fact, what we'll do is

[00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:42.980]
we'll play all the rap records that got out of the lyrics and we'll... Hey, listen, if they can do it

[00:36:42.980 --> 00:36:47.740]
down the hall right? Powerless 96 if all those people can do it. Get some art kelly, some

[00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:53.980]
fitis it. There you go. Fiddy sent my ass. Where'd he stay? It might be our certain use of slaves.

[00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:58.340]
The outright theft of land from Native Americans and tremendous Japanese Americans and W.2. Or

[00:36:58.340 --> 00:37:02.380]
need your passage of USA Patriotic and the imprisonment of who knows how many Americans

[00:37:02.380 --> 00:37:07.320]
in the aftermath of 9-11 each is a dark moment in our history, Doug Thompson writes. In each case,

[00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:12.500]
America took a wrong turn. In some cases, you'd backtrack and try to make good on her mistakes.

[00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:16.740]
Over the past more or a day, W.E.K. in America was forced once again to take a long,

[00:37:16.740 --> 00:37:20.300]
hard look in the mirror. If she was honest with herself, she didn't like what she saw.

[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:25.360]
She saw a nation deeply divided by the most controversial worsens Vietnam. She saw a country

[00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:29.400]
where the vast majority of its citizens no longer trust their government like faith in their leaders.

[00:37:29.940 --> 00:37:33.380]
She saw a country that paused to honor its war dead while wondering why they had to

[00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:37.660]
die in yet another foreign land for reasons that didn't exist. The face that stirred back at

[00:37:37.660 --> 00:37:42.500]
America looked drawn, haggard and depressed. It was the face of age and worryness wrinkled

[00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:47.460]
by too many fights with too many foes real and imagined. It was a face wooded by moral ambivalence,

[00:37:47.780 --> 00:37:53.200]
wooded by sin and puckmarked by corruption. Perhaps it's a face that no plastic surgeon can save

[00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:58.580]
and asking a soul that no salvation can redeem. Or perhaps behind those dark solid eyes lies the

[00:37:58.580 --> 00:38:03.680]
spark of resolve that is otherwise one more time, one more time, to the challenge in fights to survive.

[00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:09.720]
Our so-called leaders have raped America, raped them, leaving her body ravaged in her morale,

[00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:13.940]
all but destroyed. It's easy to rise up on partisan honks and point the finger of blame on other

[00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:18.460]
sides, but the sad fact remains that all of us, Republican, Democrat, independent, conservative,

[00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:22.260]
liberal, moderate, right, left and middle, share the blame for the political anthill and moral

[00:38:22.260 --> 00:38:27.880]
tide that swoops over America like a tsunami. Mommy. The many problems that played this nation

[00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:31.780]
span presidential administrations, changes in congressional leadership, and shifts in

[00:38:31.780 --> 00:38:36.780]
providing national philosophies. These problems lie in a national psyche that places individual

[00:38:36.780 --> 00:38:41.480]
desires above national interest, greed above service, and lust for power above consideration for

[00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:46.020]
the common good. And we can't begin to solve these problems until we put aside our partisanship,

[00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:50.940]
our anger, our hate, our need to win it all cost. Until we do, America will continue a headlong

[00:38:50.940 --> 00:38:55.780]
plunge into the abyss. But when America looked into the mirror this past weekend, the face staring

[00:38:55.780 --> 00:39:01.580]
back at her belonged to all of us. Oh my God, I sure hope was my face. Have you worn and

[00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:05.780]
haggard? Remember, moral, haggard? Is he still dead or is he alive? I don't know. Was he ever?

[00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:10.460]
He made come back to life, I don't know. He's still alive. I don't know. I have no idea. Plus,

[00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:13.700]
he couldn't sing as well. I have a paper sack. All of them come to music people. Yeah.

[00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:17.580]
Come to music. That's another oxymoron. It's like a rap music. You're in luck. I don't have a

[00:39:17.900 --> 00:39:21.100]
moral haggard. You got a little haggard? Good. Because I don't know. I look a little worn

[00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:25.340]
and haggard. But like Al said there on our my space, I'm not dying it. And nobody said that I was.

[00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:28.780]
Just because George keeps talking about the money I'm going to leave it in my will,

[00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:33.360]
I got other people in there. They're not talking about it. They're just keeping their mouth shut.

[00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:36.440]
They're what? They're not saying, oh, we think you're going to die pretty soon. You better hurry it up.

[00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:40.700]
They might be thinking that. By the end of this month would be good.

[00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:47.340]
See, at least George is honest. He says he needs it right. Boy, he needs it tonight. I don't

[00:39:47.340 --> 00:39:51.700]
need to want to poke in 20 years or 20 years. He needs it now. Why not make it to buy this by the time

[00:39:51.700 --> 00:39:55.900]
you quit? I'm like, look, what I'll do is after the show go out and eat like a gallon ice cream.

[00:39:55.900 --> 00:39:59.420]
I was like, all right, they're not. I'm kidding. I got to kill myself just to make you happy.

[00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:05.780]
Now, see, you need to take a listen from some of my other um, right? Yeah. People, right?

[00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:15.140]
They don't want. Oh, God. You're straight no matter how much you're still worth more to me

[00:40:15.140 --> 00:40:19.600]
alive than dead. If you were going to leave you all of this morning and you heard my voice,

[00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:25.600]
you said you're going to die. All right. That's it. That's the height of my day. Okay. Right.

[00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:31.680]
And just like this radio station, a bunch of cutless, a fanceless lunatics, I'm worth a hell of a lot more

[00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:36.040]
of them alive than I'm dead. Sure. Guaranteed of that. Because when they start playing those

[00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:39.760]
stupid ass tapes after I croak, they're going to find out, oh, gee, nobody wants to hear the tapes

[00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:46.420]
of alien in the Pope any more. You idiots, you clowns. Although Gary Lewis said everybody loves

[00:40:46.420 --> 00:40:50.600]
a clown. Don't know. You have to play that again. All right. About Gary Lewis and the gate or play

[00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:56.140]
boys. Eight ninety eight. After the break, we're going to go over 900 and Chris is really. He's all

[00:40:56.140 --> 00:41:03.000]
excited about it because somehow he's got, he's we, 901 already. Wow. Even I just mentioned his name

[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:07.320]
when we get in big chunks. By the way, Brandon's not too happy about the Josh going to be on next

[00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:11.040]
week. He's going to rip him an ass all week long. I don't know what those two are going on, but it's a

[00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:15.660]
mutual. I hate. So one thing about Josh quarters is it's like he'd rather love or hate either love

[00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:21.760]
more. You hate him. Well, maybe he hasn't met Josh. He's okay. He's a good guy. He's all right.

[00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:25.120]
He never stole a free train. He's got the Russian girlfriend. That's right. That's why most guys

[00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:29.200]
like him because they want to get close to him so they can keep him on his back and spirit away

[00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:34.300]
that Russian girlfriend and her spirits and her right grab a handful of that ass. Josh is.

[00:41:38.620 --> 00:41:45.640]
903. Oh, I tell you one thing. It's you're like jolly joe then. Boy, we can have a party. That's

[00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:51.740]
a party man. The card has got five votes already. I'll ride. Let's have a big grab jolly joe's

[00:41:51.740 --> 00:41:57.620]
ass party. Oh, brother. Call a thousand people. Let you know. There's plenty for everybody. 1056

[00:41:57.620 --> 00:42:05.560]
in QAM. This is the Neil Roger show. This is your brain. Any questions?

[00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:19.360]
On the good ship. On this stud it's a slave ship and it's very hot when you roll all day.

[00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:30.380]
And the wind you have the back with change. It's a wooden ship and it smells a lot like an arm fit

[00:42:30.380 --> 00:42:37.540]
or a bad egg part. And then you die of disease. They throw the body in the sea.

[00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:51.180]
Stressed in the hole, the toilet for your pillow is around. And if you go play it all knows.

[00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:59.120]
White there will be two if the rust deep change. On the slave ship. They don't serve no food when you can

[00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:08.140]
cheese. They feed it back to you. Life is very hot on the good ship. On this time.

[00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:15.100]
It's 11.15.60 WQ. I'm happy Wednesday to it's me. 30. Wow. Me.

[00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:17.240]
Or may not.

[00:43:22.940 --> 00:43:29.420]
1421 friends in my space. Boy McGill was just blown away. He couldn't believe it. That an old far like me would have all those living and breathing people on there.

[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:37.320]
And the interesting part of it on this show is we don't make anybody up. We don't have the fake Joe Zagaki and the fake Stugots and the fake you know fake audience.

[00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:39.940]
And we turned on all the hores too. There's a lot of them.

[00:43:40.260 --> 00:43:46.180]
I just had a new lady and that's why I was like a little his and there was like reaching over and yanking something.

[00:43:46.180 --> 00:43:54.800]
Not what you think. It was a lady. But anyway, and she didn't have any friends just Tom. I don't know. But I checked her all out there.

[00:43:54.800 --> 00:44:01.880]
She's got like real pictures and she's probably just on there for us. Or maybe you'd like her. I don't know. She loves you.

[00:44:04.460 --> 00:44:10.360]
I mean, it's hard to tell you know you have to use your best judgements. If there's no picture, if there's no profile picture, no chance.

[00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:18.440]
Right. I mean, I do. I mean, I can understand that there's some people who just want to get on their communicate with me desperately because I am legendary.

[00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:23.100]
And maybe because they're real only. You have the ability to create an account. You have the ability to upload a picture.

[00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:30.060]
Really. Really. Well, yeah, I'll pass that along. And speaking of that, Sean the a Felix the can't guy.

[00:44:30.380 --> 00:44:33.640]
Since it's another one of these pre-story, I think he just makes him up. Great. You go Sean.

[00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:38.840]
Kathy Larville. This is the headline in Chicago Arts,

[00:44:38.940 --> 00:44:44.340]
Dinesy, Settles, Priests, Abuse cases. Kathy Larville thought by working at her some Keith's Catholic Elementary School.

[00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:49.000]
She could shield him from danger and guarantee him a happy childhood, childhood.

[00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:56.980]
But in 2003, her adults unshared horrifying news. Not just bad news, but horrifying news. That's right.

[00:44:58.500 --> 00:45:03.840]
At his eighth birthday party and celebration of his first communion Reverend Vincent McCaffrey had molested him.

[00:45:04.420 --> 00:45:09.980]
And inside the Larville's home no less, the abuse he said continued for four years behind closed in the doors,

[00:45:10.420 --> 00:45:14.560]
just steps away from his mother's desk as St. Joseph the worker's school in Wheeling.

[00:45:15.180 --> 00:45:19.940]
Isn't that nice? Here, mommy sitting at her desk just a few yards away probably.

[00:45:20.420 --> 00:45:22.200]
And he's in there diddling with her a little boy.

[00:45:22.980 --> 00:45:27.620]
I would rather have died than let this happen to my son Kathy, a heart-larvel sent through tears of

[00:45:27.620 --> 00:45:32.320]
the news conference yesterday. I was there. It was done in my home, was done in my place of work.

[00:45:32.580 --> 00:45:34.980]
Now I know a true predator knows how to play the game.

[00:45:36.020 --> 00:45:40.140]
One thing about those priests, maybe they should sign off for the dolphins, they know how to play the game.

[00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:42.400]
They know how to handle the ball.

[00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:48.320]
On Tuesday, Keith Larville, 33 and 14 other plaintiffs announced a series of settlements with the

[00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:52.980]
Chicago Arts Dice season. It doesn't include an informer priest's reach since March 2006,

[00:45:53.180 --> 00:45:59.760]
totaling more than 6.65 million. I'll take it. One plaintiff will receive about 2.3 million. I'll take it.

[00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:04.020]
Now give George a few and I will give Josh Cordis a couple of bucks.

[00:46:04.220 --> 00:46:07.060]
Sure, he does. You'll give it to him. How do you take it?

[00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:08.380]
Out of my cup. I'm happy to.

[00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:14.000]
I'm not giving him no more money. I mean for the website thing, yeah, but as far as like,

[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:18.500]
you know, trips and planes and boats, what are what is he thinking about? I mean after he's asked me for money,

[00:46:18.620 --> 00:46:21.440]
we can just say different around. You know, he's thinking about it. Thank you.

[00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:26.960]
What? You always say that. Say what? Are you money people think everybody's always sniffing around for your money?

[00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:36.860]
Look who's talking. Hey, right. Right.

[00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:40.280]
Out. Okay. Right. It's done. All right.

[00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:46.600]
The settlements covered what's he looking like when he says that, Chris? He got a smile on his face?

[00:46:46.780 --> 00:46:49.320]
Oh, he's got a big ol' smile. Yeah. He knows it's not going to be interesting.

[00:46:49.340 --> 00:46:51.680]
And he's a little worried about it. He's got like a smile on a word.

[00:46:51.980 --> 00:46:54.280]
You worry about your money and then you won't have anything to worry about.

[00:46:54.500 --> 00:46:57.140]
Hey, nothing to worry about. Right. There you go. You got nothing to worry about.

[00:46:57.200 --> 00:46:59.280]
Just stop poaching around with my money.

[00:47:00.520 --> 00:47:03.840]
The settlements covered abuse as early as 1962 and his latest 89,

[00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:06.100]
with most of the abuse taking place during the 70s,

[00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:08.640]
said Archdiocese, spokeswoman Susan Burrith.

[00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:12.980]
All 12 priests named have been removed from public ministry of Died.

[00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:16.740]
She said, well, thank God for that. Of the 15 planted subrots,

[00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:20.980]
suits one is committed suicide. The 12 priests, former and current,

[00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:23.100]
named in the settlement include and it's got a list of the names,

[00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:24.620]
which is rather pointless for me to read them.

[00:47:25.140 --> 00:47:27.280]
Keith Larve, a well-known operations manager from Hoffman Estate,

[00:47:27.480 --> 00:47:29.980]
said that although he had written about the abuse and die-reason journals,

[00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:32.220]
he had never admitted in our loud.

[00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:35.140]
Even during therapy, after trying to take his own life,

[00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:38.220]
he came forward after seeing a schoolmate on TV who would sue McCaffrey

[00:47:38.220 --> 00:47:40.360]
and told his wife before approaching his parents.

[00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:43.840]
I battle my inner demons every day still, Larve.

[00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:47.140]
It's important that I hold the Archdiocese to some level of accountability.

[00:47:47.620 --> 00:47:50.020]
I handed this for myself and for those who have yet to come forward.

[00:47:50.740 --> 00:47:53.820]
Just another isolated incident. There's only a few million isolated incidents,

[00:47:54.420 --> 00:47:55.640]
a few child molesting priests.

[00:47:56.760 --> 00:47:59.940]
And if there's one thing I want to emphasize, never forget you learned on this show.

[00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:01.320]
People stagnant in the church.

[00:48:01.480 --> 00:48:01.660]
Right.

[00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:07.180]
Kathy Larve, a well-credits therapy and medicine for helping her family cope.

[00:48:07.340 --> 00:48:08.320]
For sons, journals, she said,

[00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:11.260]
and revealed a heart and soul of someone who is totally destroyed.

[00:48:12.100 --> 00:48:16.980]
Burit said the Archdiocese has paid more than $51.8 million to 214 people

[00:48:16.980 --> 00:48:18.500]
who brought sexual abuse allegations.

[00:48:18.940 --> 00:48:20.480]
The church could be feeding a lot of starving,

[00:48:20.660 --> 00:48:23.760]
and desperate and homeless people with that $52 million couldn't they?

[00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:24.940]
Funny as if they can.

[00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:25.200]

[00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:27.220]
They know they're too busy paying off.

[00:48:27.300 --> 00:48:29.180]
People that were molested by these perverts.

[00:48:29.300 --> 00:48:29.720]
That's right.

[00:48:29.940 --> 00:48:30.700]
And not the good perverts.

[00:48:30.700 --> 00:48:33.340]
They're good perverts like me, and then there are bad perverts.

[00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:35.660]
Because I don't try to con anybody, okay?

[00:48:35.940 --> 00:48:36.500]
I'm a pervert.

[00:48:36.580 --> 00:48:37.760]
In fact, I'm going to write it on my forehead.

[00:48:37.900 --> 00:48:38.380]
I'm a pervert.

[00:48:38.460 --> 00:48:39.380]
If you don't like it, get lost.

[00:48:39.580 --> 00:48:40.080]
I don't like hell.

[00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:41.840]
Write it backwards so people can write it.

[00:48:42.580 --> 00:48:45.280]
The Archdiocese always takes any claims of sexual misconduct seriously,

[00:48:45.540 --> 00:48:46.780]
and encourages anyone to come forward.

[00:48:46.820 --> 00:48:47.600]
Who may have been a man's background,

[00:48:48.180 --> 00:48:50.360]
deacon religious or lay employee of the Archdiocese.

[00:48:50.700 --> 00:48:51.340]
I like that term.

[00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:52.380]
They're a lay employee.

[00:48:53.820 --> 00:48:56.100]
Like they say in Hawaii, come on, I want to lay out.

[00:48:57.100 --> 00:49:01.040]
Attorney Jeff Anderson set his office plans to offer pro bono assistance to people

[00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:03.280]
who wish to pursue for early election against the accused,

[00:49:03.460 --> 00:49:06.720]
pre-such as locating and suing them in and working to alert the community

[00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:07.880]
where the defendants now live.

[00:49:08.860 --> 00:49:11.520]
Some victims feel that further exposing their perpetrators

[00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:14.440]
will be positive for the public and positive for themselves, Anderson said.

[00:49:14.780 --> 00:49:18.940]
In nearly every clergy molestation case, both the individual and the supervisors are sued.

[00:49:19.120 --> 00:49:21.340]
But in nearly every case, once the settlement is achieved with the

[00:49:21.340 --> 00:49:23.600]
diocese of employer, the case is OVA.

[00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:24.420]
It's OVA.

[00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:26.900]
And life goes on.

[00:49:27.040 --> 00:49:30.220]
For some, and of course for some, it don't because they already blew their brains out or whatever.

[00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:32.780]
Well, they took the Sinai tablets.

[00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:34.140]
Maybe that's what we can have the greatest to.

[00:49:34.340 --> 00:49:36.080]
Let's set over some Sinai tablets to Naples.

[00:49:36.180 --> 00:49:36.600]
What do you say?

[00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:38.280]
They're probably cheap.

[00:49:40.520 --> 00:49:42.180]
Cheaply Archdiocese, there's the chance for you.

[00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:43.440]
Just pop a couple.

[00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:48.320]
944, and then the day that she croaks, let me tell you what I'm going to do.

[00:49:48.520 --> 00:49:51.140]
The day that she pops those Sinai catholes,

[00:49:51.340 --> 00:49:51.780]
all day.

[00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:53.660]
No fart sounds anymore.

[00:49:54.080 --> 00:49:54.840]
Four hours, baby.

[00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:58.000]
For a week, 20 hours of ain't no fart sounds no more.

[00:49:58.000 --> 00:49:59.900]
No fart sounds like baby.

[00:49:59.980 --> 00:50:03.880]
No fun because some nasty smelly bitch with an attitude is got to,

[00:50:03.940 --> 00:50:07.280]
she's got the keys to the kingdom, maybe, and the naked picture of the beesleys with the

[00:50:07.280 --> 00:50:07.760]
werewolves.

[00:50:07.840 --> 00:50:08.420]
I'm sure of that.

[00:50:10.460 --> 00:50:11.800]
944 votes on the pool today.

[00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:13.400]
Everything is beautiful.

[00:50:13.620 --> 00:50:13.900]
I don't know.

[00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:16.200]
All of a sudden my whole attitude changed.

[00:50:16.920 --> 00:50:17.640]
You notice that?

[00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:19.640]
I didn't, but not the originate.

[00:50:20.020 --> 00:50:20.180]
Yeah.

[00:50:20.760 --> 00:50:22.980]
That's pretty damn into dumpster this morning early.

[00:50:23.260 --> 00:50:26.680]
Then all my good correspondents out there came through and put a big smile on my

[00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:26.940]
purse.

[00:50:27.380 --> 00:50:28.720]
And here I sit now like a lady.

[00:50:29.020 --> 00:50:29.160]
Yeah.

[00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:33.600]
There you go.

[00:50:34.380 --> 00:50:34.860]
That's right.

[00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:37.520]
Jesus loves the little children and so does the father of a tool.

[00:50:38.340 --> 00:50:39.560]
The different way of sure.

[00:50:39.720 --> 00:50:42.460]
Well, the father of a tool is more of a hands-on than the one I see.

[00:50:42.660 --> 00:50:44.440]
Well, that's what that lay it on of his head is all about.

[00:50:44.460 --> 00:50:44.820]
That's right.

[00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:46.440]
Let's lay on some hands on the,

[00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:47.460]
the one thing with oil.

[00:50:48.920 --> 00:50:49.640]
945 votes.

[00:50:49.640 --> 00:50:51.820]
Let's put that wafer in your mouth too, sonny boy.

[00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:53.080]
It looked like a wafer.

[00:50:53.240 --> 00:50:54.220]
I got a wafer it to fit.

[00:50:55.240 --> 00:50:58.740]
Who's car with end driving would you least want to be a passenger in?

[00:50:59.340 --> 00:51:01.000]
Well, Nick Carter's making a little bit of a move there.

[00:51:01.080 --> 00:51:01.640]
How do you like that?

[00:51:01.780 --> 00:51:03.200]
I think probably mostly queens.

[00:51:03.740 --> 00:51:04.100]
Yeah.

[00:51:04.560 --> 00:51:04.920]
What?

[00:51:05.140 --> 00:51:05.600]
And fat chicks.

[00:51:06.580 --> 00:51:08.460]
And fat chicks like that one I call that.

[00:51:08.460 --> 00:51:08.860]
That's right.

[00:51:08.980 --> 00:51:09.740]
It would bitch me up.

[00:51:09.820 --> 00:51:10.860]
You stupid fat faggot.

[00:51:11.140 --> 00:51:12.200]
You stupid fat bitch.

[00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:13.300]
You stupid, you dead.

[00:51:13.540 --> 00:51:14.560]
She's the kind of like,

[00:51:14.560 --> 00:51:18.280]
she's kind of like the the piglets that go out of the glass at the hockey games

[00:51:18.280 --> 00:51:20.040]
and put their nose up against the glass.

[00:51:20.420 --> 00:51:21.500]
Take the sniff of the conti-

[00:51:21.500 --> 00:51:23.700]
godly they come out for a pre-game skate.

[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:24.460]
You're laughing.

[00:51:24.700 --> 00:51:25.120]
I'm telling you.

[00:51:25.160 --> 00:51:25.560]
I know.

[00:51:25.740 --> 00:51:26.140]
I've seen it.

[00:51:26.140 --> 00:51:28.460]
They put their nose right just like the tune of pig.

[00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:30.780]
You know, they put that nose curled up right against the,

[00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:34.400]
against the glass to get it a sniff of that hockey ass.

[00:51:35.700 --> 00:51:36.060]
Yeah.

[00:51:36.340 --> 00:51:37.580]
That, oh yeah.

[00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:39.240]
Oh, how sad.

[00:51:39.700 --> 00:51:41.280]
Of course, I'm down there too, but, you know,

[00:51:41.740 --> 00:51:43.440]
just just as a fan of the game.

[00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:49.000]
946 votes whose car with them driving would you least want to be a passenger in?

[00:51:49.300 --> 00:51:51.340]
Ricky Tiki Sanchez, 257.

[00:51:51.640 --> 00:51:52.480]
Nobody comes close.

[00:51:52.860 --> 00:51:54.220]
You see, I hate to break the news to Caston.

[00:51:54.300 --> 00:51:56.280]
Of course, he can't use an original material anyway.

[00:51:57.080 --> 00:52:00.340]
See, I was going to say that in the day when we got that spy facts from that setup guy, Chris,

[00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:02.240]
uh, that they already use their own material.

[00:52:02.240 --> 00:52:03.380]
Of course, they don't have any saw.

[00:52:03.460 --> 00:52:04.000]
Can they do that?

[00:52:04.820 --> 00:52:08.540]
Remember, he was pissing Ricky Tiki Sanchez's ass when he left town to go to wherever

[00:52:08.540 --> 00:52:09.600]
and he went the first time.

[00:52:09.820 --> 00:52:09.940]
Yeah.

[00:52:10.100 --> 00:52:12.300]
And MSNBC and kissy, kissy.

[00:52:12.300 --> 00:52:12.840]
Why?

[00:52:13.360 --> 00:52:14.600]
Maybe they got something.

[00:52:14.600 --> 00:52:14.600]

[00:52:15.340 --> 00:52:16.540]
Maybe they got something going on.

[00:52:16.960 --> 00:52:19.380]
They could, oh, gee, maybe they hang out with the sawgrass.

[00:52:20.340 --> 00:52:21.640]
Ricky Tiki Sanchez, 257.

[00:52:21.640 --> 00:52:23.260]
The public hates him like poison, okay?

[00:52:23.560 --> 00:52:24.960]
South Florida's on to his crap.

[00:52:26.420 --> 00:52:28.020]
10 Kennedy 178.

[00:52:28.180 --> 00:52:29.580]
Lindsay Lohan, 122.

[00:52:29.740 --> 00:52:30.420]
Poor Lindsay, man.

[00:52:30.580 --> 00:52:31.900]
She has issues and tissues.

[00:52:32.280 --> 00:52:32.440]
Sure.

[00:52:33.020 --> 00:52:34.300]
Bobby Brown, 118.

[00:52:35.120 --> 00:52:35.780]
Slime ball.

[00:52:36.060 --> 00:52:38.800]
Oh, there's Julie Berman with his Hogan's Hero's helmet on there in, uh,

[00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:39.440]
a rack.

[00:52:39.900 --> 00:52:44.340]
If he did, seriously, remember Mike Dukakis in the, uh, in the tank with a silly helmet on?

[00:52:44.640 --> 00:52:45.200]
Look at that.

[00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:45.960]
Are you watching CNN?

[00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:47.160]
No, of course not.

[00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:48.060]
Oh my god.

[00:52:48.060 --> 00:52:49.380]
What a silly looking person.

[00:52:49.500 --> 00:52:50.480]
Oh, we can't find out.

[00:52:50.580 --> 00:52:51.720]
He's not just Jewish, but Orthodox.

[00:52:52.040 --> 00:52:52.440]
Farbissen.

[00:52:52.860 --> 00:52:54.560]
There'll be last you'll see a Jew Lieberman.

[00:52:55.600 --> 00:52:56.520]
Bobby Brown, 118.

[00:52:56.780 --> 00:52:57.640]
Paris Hilton 98.

[00:52:57.780 --> 00:52:58.860]
Mel Gibson, 60.

[00:52:59.560 --> 00:53:00.400]
Speaking of Orthodox Jews.

[00:53:01.120 --> 00:53:01.860]
Mel loves the Jews.

[00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:04.340]
Billing Joel 38.

[00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:06.720]
In fact, he's got the oven on high cook right now.

[00:53:06.840 --> 00:53:08.140]
He's getting ready to invite some over for dinner.

[00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:09.920]
Britney Spears 22.

[00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:11.160]
David Haselaw 22.

[00:53:11.360 --> 00:53:12.080]
Seaghyl David.

[00:53:12.840 --> 00:53:14.300]
Nicole Richie 18 and Nick Carter.

[00:53:14.560 --> 00:53:16.280]
Next to a welfare aid late, comeer.

[00:53:16.880 --> 00:53:17.360]
13.

[00:53:17.540 --> 00:53:18.400]
You went on air late.

[00:53:18.840 --> 00:53:19.320]
946.

[00:53:19.540 --> 00:53:21.100]
Well, this hour we're going to go over a thousand.

[00:53:21.440 --> 00:53:23.380]
And then after that, you're on your own, Chris.

[00:53:23.720 --> 00:53:27.580]
Who brought you the only network for kids comes a brand new network for adults.

[00:53:28.160 --> 00:53:28.640]
Nipolodian.

[00:53:32.200 --> 00:53:32.680]
Nipolodian.

[00:53:33.680 --> 00:53:36.080]
Nipolodian brings you quality adult programming,

[00:53:36.360 --> 00:53:37.800]
like Clarissa Shaves All.

[00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:39.260]
And Rugbirds.

[00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:41.400]
And programs for the alternative lifestyle.

[00:53:41.780 --> 00:53:43.540]
It shows like two angry gerbals.

[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:45.220]
And my brother in me.

[00:53:45.700 --> 00:53:47.340]
Not to mention blockbuster movies.

[00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:49.340]
Like three men on a little lady.

[00:53:49.660 --> 00:53:51.200]
Call your cable company today.

[00:53:51.500 --> 00:53:53.140]
And tell them you want Nipolodian.

[00:53:53.460 --> 00:53:55.740]
It's the only channel exclusively for adults.

[00:53:59.320 --> 00:53:59.840]
Nipolodian.

[00:54:00.040 --> 00:54:00.040]

[00:54:00.360 --> 00:54:03.380]
It's 1117, but I tell you, you got a low voice there.

[00:54:03.500 --> 00:54:04.860]
D-Force, you know what that means, don't you?

[00:54:05.040 --> 00:54:05.660]
No, nothing.

[00:54:06.140 --> 00:54:06.480]
Okay.

[00:54:07.420 --> 00:54:08.000]
963 votes.

[00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:09.100]
Well, there's all those stereotypes.

[00:54:09.440 --> 00:54:11.240]
You know, if guys got the big D-Force,

[00:54:11.240 --> 00:54:12.640]
that means yeah, it's a lot of crap.

[00:54:12.820 --> 00:54:14.340]
You know, we're just like the thing about dark guys.

[00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:16.320]
You know, it's all generalizations.

[00:54:18.180 --> 00:54:19.200]
I'll let you do the homework.

[00:54:20.920 --> 00:54:21.600]
963 on the floor.

[00:54:21.700 --> 00:54:23.220]
We will go over a thousand a hour, Chris,

[00:54:23.340 --> 00:54:24.740]
no matter how you try to hold it back.

[00:54:25.220 --> 00:54:26.400]
And then after that, from noon to two,

[00:54:26.760 --> 00:54:29.260]
from noon to two wish, you might get Jewish.

[00:54:29.660 --> 00:54:30.520]
I don't know what's going to happen.

[00:54:31.600 --> 00:54:32.380]
We'll have over 12 hundred.

[00:54:32.660 --> 00:54:34.460]
Should make them eat their hearts out over there.

[00:54:34.460 --> 00:54:36.020]
Now, you know, I speak in a John's Court

[00:54:36.020 --> 00:54:37.740]
as he's running that QAM.com thing.

[00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:39.400]
They don't even have the guts to take a poll,

[00:54:39.520 --> 00:54:40.400]
because it would be real interesting

[00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:41.980]
to see how many votes they would get on their poll.

[00:54:42.440 --> 00:54:44.460]
They only do percentages when they do things like that,

[00:54:44.520 --> 00:54:46.360]
because they get like, you know, 20 votes in a week.

[00:54:46.940 --> 00:54:51.600]
Oh, so 80% said this and 20% said that your mama and that was that.

[00:54:52.260 --> 00:54:53.240]
Well, what the hell is that?

[00:54:53.440 --> 00:54:54.400]
We don't want to see percentages.

[00:54:54.840 --> 00:54:55.920]
We want to see numbers.

[00:54:56.140 --> 00:54:57.520]
We'll take them your way.

[00:54:57.720 --> 00:54:57.900]
It's true.

[00:54:58.020 --> 00:54:58.900]
We have a total, okay?

[00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:01.560]
Considering how legendary our used to be back

[00:55:01.560 --> 00:55:02.780]
when we worked for a real radio station.

[00:55:02.780 --> 00:55:04.740]
But yeah, and back once upon a time before

[00:55:04.740 --> 00:55:06.380]
Fat Jolly Joe came to town

[00:55:07.300 --> 00:55:08.580]
with his radio destruction.

[00:55:08.580 --> 00:55:09.160]
Oh, look at that.

[00:55:09.160 --> 00:55:10.740]
Speaking of Jolly Joe, there's Ray Nogginay.

[00:55:10.760 --> 00:55:12.760]
People don't know what Ray Nagan's been up to.

[00:55:12.900 --> 00:55:15.280]
Yeah, well, I have a feeling it's been up to being stupid,

[00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:17.060]
which, you know, just comes naturally,

[00:55:17.260 --> 00:55:18.800]
just like Fat Ass Jolly Joe.

[00:55:19.340 --> 00:55:21.100]
You know, I told you way back in the beginning.

[00:55:21.240 --> 00:55:22.340]
I don't want to say I told you so again,

[00:55:22.380 --> 00:55:23.260]
because we're good ponders.

[00:55:23.400 --> 00:55:24.240]
I will say it every day though.

[00:55:24.280 --> 00:55:24.760]
I told you so.

[00:55:24.760 --> 00:55:24.980]
Okay.

[00:55:25.320 --> 00:55:26.880]
But you did all agree with you.

[00:55:26.980 --> 00:55:28.860]
When he started with that tape business,

[00:55:29.820 --> 00:55:32.240]
at that point, I knew that there was no doubt.

[00:55:32.240 --> 00:55:34.120]
I said to myself, uh-huh.

[00:55:35.380 --> 00:55:36.560]
Tapes my ass.

[00:55:37.060 --> 00:55:38.680]
If only it was the only failed product

[00:55:38.680 --> 00:55:40.040]
that he's trying to put back on the station.

[00:55:43.540 --> 00:55:44.780]
You want to elaborate on that?

[00:55:44.820 --> 00:55:45.640]
No, I don't.

[00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:46.360]
Absolutely not.

[00:55:47.920 --> 00:55:50.440]
You know, you're going to be one deep trouble

[00:55:50.440 --> 00:55:52.140]
when Ethan Skolnik is filling in from the center.

[00:55:52.140 --> 00:55:52.540]
Oh yeah.

[00:55:54.340 --> 00:55:55.260]
That would be his fault.

[00:55:55.420 --> 00:55:58.020]
Ethan Skolnik is like the very jackass of the Sun Sentinel.

[00:55:58.640 --> 00:55:59.440]
Is that the truth?

[00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:00.060]
Is that what you said?

[00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:01.920]
No, he's a, like, general

[00:56:02.240 --> 00:56:03.320]
guy. He'll talk about anything.

[00:56:03.640 --> 00:56:05.400]
Well, I'm not talking about what he writes about.

[00:56:05.500 --> 00:56:06.900]
I'm talking about as a person.

[00:56:08.780 --> 00:56:09.960]
I don't really know him all the way.

[00:56:10.100 --> 00:56:11.520]
He's kind of a, he drops a bad bomb.

[00:56:11.660 --> 00:56:12.260]
He seems like what?

[00:56:12.980 --> 00:56:15.120]
He looks kind of like a nerd, but I mean, I don't really know him.

[00:56:15.280 --> 00:56:16.020]
So, say there you go.

[00:56:16.360 --> 00:56:16.640]
Very bad.

[00:56:16.640 --> 00:56:17.020]
I can't.

[00:56:17.020 --> 00:56:18.280]
He's probably brown bags it.

[00:56:18.620 --> 00:56:20.160]
No, Barry Jackson's in a class by himself.

[00:56:20.560 --> 00:56:21.140]
Yeah, that's true.

[00:56:21.560 --> 00:56:22.460]
He scares me when I say.

[00:56:22.500 --> 00:56:23.700]
He'll I'm Barry Jackson.

[00:56:23.940 --> 00:56:25.040]
Then what you say about me?

[00:56:25.200 --> 00:56:26.280]
A lot of what you say is true.

[00:56:26.420 --> 00:56:28.420]
Yeah, you're a nerd and a puss and get out of here, okay?

[00:56:28.720 --> 00:56:30.560]
Take your brown bag lunch and get lost, Barry.

[00:56:31.060 --> 00:56:32.240]
Rhymes with Duffery.

[00:56:33.480 --> 00:56:35.140]
Oh, and here's the, this is so sad.

[00:56:35.260 --> 00:56:37.700]
I don't want to get depressed again because I've shaken myself out of that

[00:56:37.700 --> 00:56:38.860]
with the assistance of some others.

[00:56:39.040 --> 00:56:40.560]
And I'm in a chipper mood right now.

[00:56:40.620 --> 00:56:41.220]
The sun is shining.

[00:56:41.280 --> 00:56:42.020]
It's viewed, yes, man.

[00:56:42.320 --> 00:56:43.180]
It's going to be hot.

[00:56:44.100 --> 00:56:46.600]
It is going to be hot and the smokey, maybe.

[00:56:46.660 --> 00:56:49.360]
You know what the temperature is going to be here today in the hog town?

[00:56:49.860 --> 00:56:49.860]

[00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:52.340]
28.

[00:56:52.540 --> 00:56:52.860]
What is that?

[00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:54.120]
That's more than, how do you know that?

[00:56:54.400 --> 00:56:55.220]
I don't know, but take a look.

[00:56:55.740 --> 00:56:56.640]
It's already 23.

[00:56:56.840 --> 00:56:57.280]
That's 73.

[00:56:57.280 --> 00:56:58.300]
And they're saying 28.

[00:56:58.440 --> 00:56:58.960]
What's 28?

[00:56:59.160 --> 00:56:59.700]
The Celsius.

[00:56:59.700 --> 00:57:00.920]
I'm looking over here.

[00:57:01.020 --> 00:57:01.380]
I'm 87.

[00:57:02.040 --> 00:57:02.400]
83.

[00:57:02.980 --> 00:57:03.300]
82.

[00:57:03.860 --> 00:57:04.220]
82.

[00:57:05.220 --> 00:57:05.580]
Wow.

[00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:09.360]
Well, if anybody's going to the track, maybe George can pick one for you.

[00:57:09.480 --> 00:57:09.960]
It might be 83.

[00:57:10.140 --> 00:57:12.760]
I don't know because the scale is an exact, you know, I'm just looking on the third room.

[00:57:13.220 --> 00:57:13.340]
83.

[00:57:13.700 --> 00:57:14.680]
82, it sounds more Jewish.

[00:57:14.860 --> 00:57:15.060]
Close enough.

[00:57:16.260 --> 00:57:19.760]
The push, this is by Stephen Thomas on McClatchy News Papers.

[00:57:20.180 --> 00:57:22.640]
Democrats in Washington want to keep impeachment off the table.

[00:57:22.800 --> 00:57:23.780]
Oh my god.

[00:57:24.080 --> 00:57:25.660]
This is why America's got one party.

[00:57:25.800 --> 00:57:26.980]
Man, let's have a party.

[00:57:27.880 --> 00:57:29.000]
Call us when the party starts.

[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:31.040]
OK, because then we can laugh right now.

[00:57:31.140 --> 00:57:31.560]
We're crying.

[00:57:31.780 --> 00:57:33.000]
We're crying and people are dying.

[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:34.080]
Right on the hand.

[00:57:34.340 --> 00:57:37.240]
Anyway, it says the push to impeach president Bush and vice president

[00:57:37.240 --> 00:57:41.280]
Dick Cheney is gaining a hearing in some parts of the country, but not in

[00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:41.660]
Washington.

[00:57:43.160 --> 00:57:46.640]
More than 70 cities and 14 state democratic parties have urged impeachment

[00:57:46.640 --> 00:57:48.300]
or investigations that could lead to impeachment.

[00:57:48.660 --> 00:57:51.740]
The most common charge is that Bush manipulated intelligence to lead the

[00:57:51.740 --> 00:57:52.740]
country into the Iraq war.

[00:57:53.040 --> 00:57:53.420]
No Schmidt.

[00:57:54.500 --> 00:57:57.940]
Other charges include spying on Americans and torturing suspected terrorists

[00:57:57.940 --> 00:58:00.660]
in violation of the US and international law.

[00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:02.620]
All of these things.

[00:58:03.760 --> 00:58:07.500]
Most recently the Massachusetts Democratic Party voted to push impeachment of both men.

[00:58:07.880 --> 00:58:11.360]
The 2500 state convention delegates voted almost unanimously against Cheney.

[00:58:11.600 --> 00:58:12.820]
The vote against Bush was closer.

[00:58:14.280 --> 00:58:17.980]
Massachusetts is Democratic Party that's joined 13 others on the investigator

[00:58:17.980 --> 00:58:23.600]
impeach bandwagon, including Alaska, California, Colorado, Hawaii,

[00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:26.060]
Maine, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina,

[00:58:26.060 --> 00:58:28.300]
Oregon from my Washington and Wisconsin.

[00:58:28.640 --> 00:58:31.480]
Florida of course is conspicuous by its absence, of course.

[00:58:32.160 --> 00:58:34.900]
Among the cities and towns, the largest and most recent is Detroit.

[00:58:35.600 --> 00:58:38.960]
Detroit, where the city council voted seven and nothing this month towards

[00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:42.040]
Congress to impeach Bush and Cheney for intentionally misleading Congress

[00:58:42.040 --> 00:58:45.120]
and the public regarding the threat from a record order to justify the war.

[00:58:46.700 --> 00:58:50.480]
There's a lot of growing support, said Tim Carpenter, director of the liberal

[00:58:50.480 --> 00:58:54.560]
group progressive Democrats of America, but the Congress will respond that's another question.

[00:58:54.560 --> 00:58:58.840]
Don't hold your breath. Indeed it says the Democrats who run Congress have no interest in

[00:58:58.840 --> 00:59:03.100]
impeaching Bush or Cheney despite pressure from their party's base outside the beltway.

[00:59:03.940 --> 00:59:07.140]
It's noteworthy that impeachment pressure is coming from the home states of the two

[00:59:07.140 --> 00:59:11.660]
Democratic leaders in Congress, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, California, and the very weak,

[00:59:11.780 --> 00:59:15.560]
limparasted Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada. A weak fish.

[00:59:16.680 --> 00:59:19.200]
Pelosi said last year that impeachment is off the table.

[00:59:19.980 --> 00:59:23.140]
Under the Constitution, the House impeaches the Senate and the South Florida convicted and

[00:59:23.140 --> 00:59:26.780]
removed from orifice. It's also interesting that one of the resolutions came from Detroit,

[00:59:27.100 --> 00:59:30.140]
home to representative John Connoisse who has the Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee

[00:59:30.140 --> 00:59:33.440]
would lead any impeachment hearings. He's been screaming for it.

[00:59:34.200 --> 00:59:37.560]
The Detroit resolution was co-authored by Monica Connoisse, the Congressman's wife,

[00:59:37.860 --> 00:59:41.220]
but she hasn't had any noticeable cloud at home. Connoisse had last year that he wasn't

[00:59:41.220 --> 00:59:44.620]
interested in impeachment, just oversight investigations and hasn't changed the stand.

[00:59:44.940 --> 00:59:49.440]
Well that's what this story says, but we've had stories where it says he's rattling the cage about it.

[00:59:50.300 --> 00:59:53.440]
I was going to say spheres, but that would have been, you know, right away they would have made a

[00:59:53.440 --> 00:59:58.340]
racial thing anyway. We'll stop it. There are both policy and political reasons that Democratic

[00:59:58.340 --> 01:00:01.960]
leaders are risking the anger of their base. One is that some don't see an impeachable offense

[01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:06.540]
on what Bush has done. Right. If the Constitution calls high crimes and misdemeanors,

[01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:10.020]
they might find such evidence that they've been made of congressional investigations, but they still

[01:00:10.020 --> 01:00:14.760]
have it. Another is that they fear a political backlash from voters, some are the one that punished

[01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:18.340]
Republicans after they impeached Bill Clinton. One factor on the side of the pro-impeachment

[01:00:18.340 --> 01:00:23.400]
crowd, Clinton was much more popular than Bush. The third is they're eager to keep Bush and

[01:00:23.400 --> 01:00:27.840]
Cheney around his punching bags for Democratic candidates in the 2008 campaign. The political

[01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:31.760]
lens they're looking through is the 2008 election, Carpenter said they want to see Bush and Cheney

[01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:36.520]
dangling, so the election is a referendum on them. That is not the correct lens. To him,

[01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:39.760]
the right of the lens is the last election when voters through the Republicans out of power and

[01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:44.280]
Congress. Those people, they said now want Bush and Cheney out. When in doubt, we want them out.

[01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:48.940]
There's a grounds for all here, Carpenter said. Pelosi said it's off the table. It's our role to

[01:00:48.940 --> 01:00:53.300]
put it back on the table. Let's look at the square table that went over so big on the

[01:00:53.300 --> 01:00:58.740]
Cheney and Bill Morning Show. Okay. I wonder if that's the table that Ethan Skolnik was farting at.

[01:00:59.380 --> 01:01:04.160]
Now I guess it was gone before they brought his sorry ass in there. And what about what's his name?

[01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:07.980]
Not Mercury Morris. What's the other guy we have? Oh, Jay, Oh, Jimmy, we still got him on

[01:01:07.980 --> 01:01:15.060]
Monday's or what? Chris. I've no idea. Let's hope not. Yeah, but he used to work across the street.

[01:01:15.180 --> 01:01:19.000]
So a lot of other losers, okay, who whose numbers in the book, I'll start it with a, oh, that,

[01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:23.080]
they had that in common. Number one, they didn't belong on the air, although we gravitate toward

[01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:26.800]
people that don't belong on the air. And number two, they couldn't break a one share with a shotgun.

[01:01:28.020 --> 01:01:31.660]
If somebody gave him a loaded shotgun and access to everybody with an Arbatron die, they still

[01:01:31.660 --> 01:01:36.400]
couldn't break a one share. How do you like that? That's called bad. That's called bad radio. It's

[01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:40.200]
called putting people on the air who don't belong on the air like all these loser sportswriters.

[01:01:40.940 --> 01:01:45.780]
Now after I've been harping on that for the next six months, tell me to stop it. No, okay.

[01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:50.240]
Well, I won't be on that much the next, you know, after June, after the middle of June.

[01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:54.460]
I'll be mine every July and August and like the week after Labor Day, almost three months.

[01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:59.400]
Oh, Halle, Lou, oh, happy day. Say the Edward Hawkins singers. You have to play it again. All right, I won't.

[01:02:00.900 --> 01:02:05.560]
Don't. I bet you're Ricky Tinky-Shaw has played that. How's it going, Ricky? Now you are

[01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:09.500]
confabulated with him about going to dinner with his wife and stuff with your lady? No, I have not.

[01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:13.200]
No, well, it's because he really don't care about you. I know. I wanted to go to dinner with you.

[01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:18.060]
Well, but he's not going to happen. I know. So I mean, not anytime soon. I hope you'll be able to tell me

[01:02:18.060 --> 01:02:27.340]
already about 168. It's not going to happen, Rick. My meals in Florida are reserved for a very select,

[01:02:27.820 --> 01:02:32.720]
a very select small group. No, I don't want to say that because it sounds like I'm shining. I

[01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:36.960]
know that's bad. I wouldn't want to do that because he gave, like, lift me his number and everything

[01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:43.420]
you know to call and I'm sure he's sitting there by the phone right now. He's sitting by the

[01:02:43.420 --> 01:02:49.960]
phone waiting for Old Neil to call to set up that dinner. Well, you're out of time. Yeah, what an idiot I am.

[01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:54.240]
And then again, look who I work for, you know. And they're probably thinking I'm sitting here

[01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:57.280]
ripping the crap out of them and deservedly saw every day and they still got to come up with those

[01:02:57.280 --> 01:03:01.340]
big paychecks. In fact, what's in 8 today? The 30th there'll be another one to one the 10th.

[01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:10.880]
What day is June 10th? I'll take it right now. Friday. Okay. No. It's a Saturday. Okay. That means it's

[01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:16.680]
due on the 9th, which means it'll be there on the 8th. Wow. Really exciting, you know, when you work

[01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:21.240]
for people that are willing to put out the big bucks for a once legendary show and then they take a hammer

[01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:27.880]
and an anvil and an axe and they just chop and chip and rip and tear and you know what?

[01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:33.620]
Keep the money coming. How young is too young? Absolutely. About 30, man.

[01:03:44.380 --> 01:03:46.720]
Oh my god.

[01:03:59.180 --> 01:04:05.380]
Lots of extra spice up there in a bathroom with an egg. It's having

[01:04:05.380 --> 01:04:11.820]
so

[01:04:26.260 --> 01:04:31.340]
how

[01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:49.640]
Yeah.

[01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:51.240]
Oh.

[01:04:53.420 --> 01:04:55.740]
I'm trying to remember this one.

[01:04:55.880 --> 01:04:59.940]
I have to end her scene at some point.

[01:04:59.940 --> 01:05:01.360]
I don't think so.

[01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:06.040]
But I'm on the other side.

[01:05:18.620 --> 01:05:23.980]
I'm wearing leather pants on a leather chair.

[01:05:23.980 --> 01:05:25.380]
Oh, don't do that.

[01:05:26.300 --> 01:05:27.860]
You'll slide right off.

[01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:30.160]
Just like I did that.

[01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:34.360]
What's that?

[01:05:34.900 --> 01:05:36.260]
You slide off my chair.

[01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:38.240]
I'm still imagining everything.

[01:05:39.700 --> 01:05:41.160]
Making sound with my mouth.

[01:05:44.180 --> 01:05:45.980]
I should have brought a camera.

[01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:47.000]
And some people do.

[01:06:01.900 --> 01:06:03.960]
You are absolutely correct.

[01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:05.460]
Sure.

[01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:10.340]
There is nothing there that I thought for a second or two you start losing anything.

[01:06:10.340 --> 01:06:11.800]
I'm thinking you're hearing things that are not in there.

[01:06:12.060 --> 01:06:12.200]
Right.

[01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:13.620]
And they were in there.

[01:06:13.780 --> 01:06:14.660]
No, just our imagination.

[01:06:15.080 --> 01:06:15.520]
That's right.

[01:06:16.100 --> 01:06:17.260]
Just my imagination.

[01:06:17.900 --> 01:06:18.880]
995 on the pool.

[01:06:18.980 --> 01:06:20.620]
We'll be way over 1,000 by noon.

[01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:23.300]
And then they pray they'll stop the presses, baby.

[01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:24.520]
Front page has come central.

[01:06:24.700 --> 01:06:26.600]
The Hollywood's some tenter.

[01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:27.960]
It's been out of business for 20 years.

[01:06:28.460 --> 01:06:29.520]
And of course the Harold.

[01:06:29.860 --> 01:06:30.480]
And L Harold.

[01:06:32.420 --> 01:06:35.300]
What will it say if we get 1,000 votes on the front page of the other?

[01:06:35.420 --> 01:06:36.520]
Come on Easter, come on Easter.

[01:06:38.040 --> 01:06:38.940]
Something like that.

[01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:40.240]
996.

[01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:43.140]
Now I have a church of Christ's, a phantom sassy right now.

[01:06:43.300 --> 01:06:45.860]
Of course even if we have 10 votes he's still phantom sassy.

[01:06:46.300 --> 01:06:46.500]
Exactly.

[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:54.320]
Well that was my musical tribute to Ethan Skolnick and his very aromatic ball movement that they spent at least a half hour talking about dissecting on the show yesterday.

[01:06:54.660 --> 01:06:56.700]
I guess that's how to go away to describe it dissecting.

[01:06:57.420 --> 01:06:58.540]
No, think of another word.

[01:06:58.640 --> 01:06:59.780]
I'm not this close to lunchtime.

[01:06:59.940 --> 01:07:01.760]
That's a very analyzing is a better word.

[01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:03.740]
Analyzing, yeah, that's more accurate.

[01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:04.660]
That's on top of it.

[01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:14.160]
They were analyzing it and sniffing it and describing in great detail the aromatic qualities and the smell of the lilac air freshener and the alina.

[01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:16.360]
And then of course the poofy reed which is my favorite.

[01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:19.420]
I think if they really want to hit the old pot.

[01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:20.340]
I mean the jackpot.

[01:07:20.920 --> 01:07:22.660]
What they invented it for in that way they call it that.

[01:07:24.060 --> 01:07:24.900]
996 on the area.

[01:07:24.900 --> 01:07:29.900]
Chris Nick Carter whatever his name is he still in last place all the way is tied with the Nicole Richie now 16.

[01:07:30.160 --> 01:07:33.360]
Well there are a lot of people who probably want to drive with Nicole Richie they take the chance.

[01:07:33.460 --> 01:07:37.440]
You what for what have you seen her?

[01:07:38.520 --> 01:07:40.860]
I haven't seen her lately why she got really amnesty.

[01:07:40.860 --> 01:07:45.340]
She's like anorexic and yeah she started out ugly and then got grotesque.

[01:07:45.620 --> 01:07:47.900]
Oh well in that case.

[01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:50.920]
That's why it's a dead ass tie between her and Nick Carter.

[01:07:50.920 --> 01:07:51.260]
Okay.

[01:07:52.900 --> 01:07:54.880]
At least he's got a little more meat on his bones.

[01:07:55.240 --> 01:07:55.240]

[01:07:56.700 --> 01:08:01.920]
When it's super well outside of the stuff that happens in Jojo baby no wonder they think about Jojo Jojo.

[01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:10.040]
When it's super superior court judge Rye Bachelor yesterday rejected a mother's plea to have the Harry Potter books removed from county school libraries.

[01:08:10.360 --> 01:08:16.580]
You know Georgia and Kansas to me seem to be I could be wrong but they seem far and away to be the most knee into the state.

[01:08:16.580 --> 01:08:17.140]
Right.

[01:08:18.580 --> 01:08:21.360]
Laura Mallory of Loganville lost her argument for judicial relief.

[01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:26.480]
Mallory argues that Potter stories are harmful and promote witchcraft and the occult to young people.

[01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:30.440]
Supporters of the Potter books say they encourage children to reach and be able all students.

[01:08:30.740 --> 01:08:33.340]
Read a book, read a mother's scratch and book for Christ's sake.

[01:08:33.740 --> 01:08:34.020]
Cracker.

[01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:37.260]
She argued her position for about an hour.

[01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:38.960]
I think we got to play that on the year today.

[01:08:39.460 --> 01:08:39.860]
Audio.

[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:40.300]
I agree.

[01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:47.760]
Oh, we're not getting from who who passed that long.

[01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:48.840]
My daughter found it.

[01:08:48.900 --> 01:08:49.500]
I passed it too.

[01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:50.120]
Her daughter found it.

[01:08:50.260 --> 01:08:50.260]

[01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:52.880]
It's witchcraft baby.

[01:08:53.140 --> 01:08:53.900]
It's old frecky.

[01:08:54.100 --> 01:08:54.920]
That's the one.

[01:08:54.940 --> 01:08:55.540]
We know it.

[01:08:55.660 --> 01:08:56.180]
That's from a home.

[01:08:56.540 --> 01:08:58.220]
Probably in one right now.

[01:08:58.560 --> 01:08:59.080]
That's strict.

[01:08:59.420 --> 01:09:00.600]
My conscience.

[01:09:00.820 --> 01:09:01.180]
Bad.

[01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:02.780]
He couldn't sing at all.

[01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:04.300]
But the mob liked him a lot.

[01:09:04.500 --> 01:09:08.540]
And that's say you know she argued a position for about why we playing.

[01:09:08.540 --> 01:09:08.960]
She's the real one.

[01:09:09.060 --> 01:09:10.180]
You can talk over it.

[01:09:10.280 --> 01:09:11.040]
Don't worry about it.

[01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:12.320]
She argued her position for about an hour.

[01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:13.880]
She's did before back for her made his ruling.

[01:09:14.060 --> 01:09:15.320]
I've done the best I can with all this.

[01:09:15.380 --> 01:09:16.280]
Malorie said after the hearing.

[01:09:16.720 --> 01:09:18.620]
Malorie now said she may file a federal lawsuit.

[01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:23.040]
She launched her anti-pattern crusade in 2005.

[01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:27.100]
Malorie, since she did, Malorie's taken the case to administrators at the Loganville Elementary

[01:09:27.100 --> 01:09:27.480]
School.

[01:09:27.620 --> 01:09:31.280]
Her children attend to a school appeals committee to the Gwyneth County Board of Education,

[01:09:31.720 --> 01:09:34.140]
to the Georgia Board of Education and the law set at each level.

[01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:39.360]
Malorie bases her claim in part on testimonials and internet articles by conservative Christian

[01:09:39.360 --> 01:09:44.440]
authors, by crazy people, conservative Christian authors, that she's posted on her website.

[01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:48.480]
Malorie now does she hasn't read any of the six books in the Harry Potter series.

[01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:51.780]
The seventh and final one is scheduled for release this summer.

[01:09:52.260 --> 01:09:53.600]
Why wouldn't have to be the final one?

[01:09:54.260 --> 01:09:55.460]
Is he going to kill or something in there?

[01:09:55.920 --> 01:09:58.020]
The plan was that this is...

[01:09:58.020 --> 01:09:59.140]
Thousands of votes by the way.

[01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:00.820]
Even one oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh.

[01:10:01.420 --> 01:10:06.320]
That was her original plan, JK Rowling, is to have that many books, that many volumes in the series.

[01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:07.000]
I see.

[01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:08.720]
How many years have they're at Hogwarts?

[01:10:09.700 --> 01:10:10.100]
How many what?

[01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:11.620]
Years that they're at Hogwarts.

[01:10:12.440 --> 01:10:13.500]
I didn't even know that.

[01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:16.100]
Ask me if I care.

[01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:17.600]
Do you care Harry Potter?

[01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:19.960]
It's for little kids for Christ's sake, you know?

[01:10:20.780 --> 01:10:24.380]
Any adult that is talking Harry Potter, I'd be real worried about them.

[01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:26.640]
Unless of course they were good conservative Christian then.

[01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:28.760]
I really be scared as hell.

[01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:31.420]
Thousands of votes even on the pool baby.

[01:10:31.620 --> 01:10:34.840]
We are really rockin' and rollin' here in spite of the best efforts of Joyce.

[01:10:35.180 --> 01:10:37.400]
You miserable nasty, hostile, hateful bitch.

[01:10:37.880 --> 01:10:38.280]
You saw.

[01:10:39.100 --> 01:10:44.600]
You know what's upon a time I think it was last year that I passed along the information that I had on very good authority that Joyce,

[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:49.920]
from my double-dipping, double-billing attorney, he had told me that she will do anything in her power to destroy this show.

[01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:53.060]
And people probably thought, oh that nail is exaggerating, you know, make stuff up.

[01:10:53.280 --> 01:10:56.140]
Well, I rest my case right on your face.

[01:10:56.980 --> 01:10:57.400]
You.

[01:10:57.980 --> 01:10:58.720]
Yeah, I know.

[01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:02.680]
What a bad place for your case in outer space.

[01:11:03.140 --> 01:11:04.340]
A thousand six votes on the pool.

[01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:09.020]
Whose car, with them driving, would you least want to be a passenger in Ricky Tiki Sanchez?

[01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:12.100]
And by the way, that guy is still dead, 270 votes.

[01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:16.200]
And Ricky Tiki is on here on CNN, talkin' crap over and over again.

[01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:17.200]
In English, no less.

[01:11:18.340 --> 01:11:20.880]
Ted Kennedy, 188. Lindsay Lohan, 127.

[01:11:21.420 --> 01:11:22.320]
Bobby Brown, 26.

[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:23.220]
Oops.

[01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:24.700]
What was that supposed to be?

[01:11:24.700 --> 01:11:25.720]
Be Canon and Goodman.

[01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:26.280]
Oh.

[01:11:27.060 --> 01:11:28.220]
Why did I want to hear it?

[01:11:28.260 --> 01:11:28.800]
You didn't.

[01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:29.480]
It was in the stake.

[01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:32.200]
Paris Hilton 104 was a mistake that nobody got hurt.

[01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:35.860]
Mel Gibson, 66.

[01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:36.980]
Billy Joel, 43.

[01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:38.360]
David Hassel's Hof, 44.

[01:11:40.660 --> 01:11:43.340]
Boy, then talk about a guy whose religion is on mine.

[01:11:43.460 --> 01:11:44.020]
Can he sing?

[01:11:44.380 --> 01:11:44.740]
No, no.

[01:11:44.860 --> 01:11:45.380]
Can he act?

[01:11:45.380 --> 01:11:45.540]
No.

[01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:46.420]
Was he ever on a good show?

[01:11:46.500 --> 01:11:46.620]
No.

[01:11:46.900 --> 01:11:48.500]
Well, I was on a stupid car show.

[01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:49.580]
I was on a show he was on.

[01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:51.360]
Oh, I was on a win.

[01:11:51.460 --> 01:11:52.460]
Excuse me, gay watch.

[01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:53.360]
Oh, excuse me.

[01:11:53.360 --> 01:11:54.940]
God, am I getting stupid or what?

[01:11:55.340 --> 01:11:55.820]
Speaking of Germany.

[01:11:56.260 --> 01:11:58.140]
Do you know that's the most watch show in the world?

[01:11:58.440 --> 01:11:58.440]

[01:11:58.760 --> 01:11:59.200]
You know the one in Germany?

[01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:00.480]
They don't watch.

[01:12:00.760 --> 01:12:01.240]
They don't watch.

[01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:01.240]

[01:12:01.940 --> 01:12:03.000]
They like him in Germany.

[01:12:03.700 --> 01:12:04.680]
Because he's one of theirs.

[01:12:04.860 --> 01:12:04.980]
Right.

[01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:07.960]
That's why they like Hitler too.

[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:10.040]
Britney Spears, 22.

[01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:11.180]
Nicole Richie, 19.

[01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:13.380]
Nick Carter, 17.

[01:12:13.900 --> 01:12:15.960]
Well, you know, sometimes if he's one of yours, you know,

[01:12:16.540 --> 01:12:19.100]
it's like the Jews that liked Monachem Began, you know,

[01:12:19.160 --> 01:12:19.800]
he was one of theirs.

[01:12:20.440 --> 01:12:21.660]
We are far-bisoned.

[01:12:21.660 --> 01:12:24.280]
And of course, Olmert, who belongs in a mental institution,

[01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:27.320]
well, I bet you, David should do Libra makes this stop

[01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:29.140]
to shake his hand before.

[01:12:29.140 --> 01:12:29.560]
Oh, yeah.

[01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:30.700]
I'm looking at Tom Kiss.

[01:12:31.460 --> 01:12:33.080]
But did, did that helmet, though, man?

[01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:36.480]
He looked, oh, even without the helmet, he's a silly looking

[01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:38.760]
goofball, you know, he looks like he's sucking on a quince.

[01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:41.640]
But man, he is the, you've got to see that.

[01:12:41.720 --> 01:12:44.140]
Before the day is over, you'll see all the footage on every newscast.

[01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:47.920]
Watch CNN and MSNBC and maybe even Fox News, if you dare.

[01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:52.040]
And see, Julie Grimman with Agufi, you made me change it.

[01:12:52.100 --> 01:12:54.760]
And I'm going to change it back to SpicBrusTV, now.

[01:12:54.980 --> 01:12:55.200]
Thank you.

[01:12:55.200 --> 01:12:55.440]
Go ahead.

[01:12:55.960 --> 01:12:59.180]
I urge everyone to complain to this station.

[01:13:06.860 --> 01:13:08.780]
Tom is through with Mimi.

[01:13:11.060 --> 01:13:13.040]
Look at what she's losing.

[01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:17.420]
She divorced her top gun.

[01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:20.920]
Now Tom can go out cruising.

[01:13:21.620 --> 01:13:22.140]
You ferry.

[01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:29.680]
You tell me, tell me, Mimi, Mimi.

[01:13:30.540 --> 01:13:33.460]
What's he got that I don't?

[01:13:34.760 --> 01:13:36.820]
What's his greater deal?

[01:13:37.820 --> 01:13:38.360]
Welcome.

[01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:40.920]
He's got looks and talent.

[01:13:42.820 --> 01:13:45.420]
What's the great big deal?

[01:13:46.040 --> 01:13:48.180]
Who can tell?

[01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:55.660]
Rainman, Tommy, Tommy, Tommy.

[01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:14.320]
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

[01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:14.320]

[01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:17.020]
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

[01:14:17.020 --> 01:14:21.020]
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

[01:14:21.020 --> 01:14:24.720]
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

[01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:25.640]
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

[01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:25.640]

[01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:25.640]

[01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:25.640]

[01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:25.640]

[01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:25.640]

[01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:25.640]

[01:14:28.420 --> 01:14:30.440]
Oh, she is screaming Mimi, who is the screamer?

[01:14:30.440 --> 01:14:30.840]
You ferry.

[01:14:30.980 --> 01:14:32.580]
I would have thought they would have got along well together.

[01:14:32.740 --> 01:14:35.300]
14 before known at 5.60 WQ AM.

[01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:37.320]
10.60 and a point.

[01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:37.880]
What are you saying?

[01:14:38.020 --> 01:14:38.260]
What do you do?

[01:14:38.260 --> 01:14:39.380]
A number of you throwing around club 100?

[01:14:40.200 --> 01:14:40.460]
Yeah.

[01:14:41.620 --> 01:14:43.200]
I'm thinking we can do a lot better than that.

[01:14:44.620 --> 01:14:45.260]
12.50.

[01:14:46.500 --> 01:14:48.160]
But let's make it like an auction every day.

[01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:49.260]
And I like it like we're doing it every day.

[01:14:49.260 --> 01:14:50.140]
Yeah, but I do it every day.

[01:14:50.140 --> 01:14:51.660]
Yeah, but I do it every day.

[01:14:51.660 --> 01:14:51.960]
Like that.

[01:14:52.660 --> 01:14:54.040]
You always really a great auctioner.

[01:14:54.120 --> 01:14:55.720]
Anyways, tons of money for charity doing it.

[01:14:55.800 --> 01:14:58.140]
And always donated this time as Bob Weaver.

[01:14:58.420 --> 01:14:58.860]
Weaver the weather.

[01:14:58.980 --> 01:15:01.200]
What a great guy he was, man.

[01:15:01.500 --> 01:15:03.500]
They stuck in an early grave there at Channel 4.

[01:15:03.960 --> 01:15:05.520]
You butcher as you murderers.

[01:15:05.640 --> 01:15:06.260]
They destroyed him.

[01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:08.440]
They put him out to pasture and guess what he did.

[01:15:08.540 --> 01:15:08.820]
He died.

[01:15:10.280 --> 01:15:12.020]
Not a good idea to go out to pasture early.

[01:15:12.100 --> 01:15:13.400]
Let me tell you that's why I'm going to sit in this chair.

[01:15:13.500 --> 01:15:14.140]
I'm going to keep talking.

[01:15:14.140 --> 01:15:15.320]
Even if there's nobody listening.

[01:15:15.460 --> 01:15:16.680]
If there's nobody listening, if there's nobody, if I'm not on the air.

[01:15:16.740 --> 01:15:17.900]
I'm going to just sit here every day.

[01:15:18.140 --> 01:15:18.300]
What?

[01:15:19.860 --> 01:15:20.440]
That's right.

[01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:22.180]
Well, we're working on that anyway.

[01:15:22.180 --> 01:15:23.480]
I know it.

[01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:25.840]
Practice makes perfect.

[01:15:26.140 --> 01:15:27.180]
That's what they say in the church.

[01:15:28.540 --> 01:15:31.880]
Fox who just rosy was fired over the leaked video of 9-11 talk.

[01:15:32.120 --> 01:15:32.900]
Oh my God.

[01:15:33.180 --> 01:15:38.460]
You know, she's another one who, you know, I agree with a lot of what she says.

[01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:40.560]
Maybe most of what she says, but it doesn't make any difference.

[01:15:40.680 --> 01:15:41.520]
I can't stand her.

[01:15:43.140 --> 01:15:44.820]
She makes me want to puke right.

[01:15:47.140 --> 01:15:47.820]
Like Bill Marr.

[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:49.760]
And who else?

[01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:50.660]
Who are some of these other people?

[01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:52.060]
And now, of course, Keith Oberman.

[01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:55.780]
Because even though he does that, you know, I'm assuming he's still doing his wonderful job.

[01:15:55.880 --> 01:15:56.760]
Because I don't watch him anymore.

[01:15:57.420 --> 01:16:03.240]
Because since he put the file nails in an armistice coffin and demanded that he get fired for the nappy head of the whole of his business.

[01:16:04.200 --> 01:16:06.940]
People in this business that run around trying to get other people fired.

[01:16:06.940 --> 01:16:08.720]
They just have no respect for it.

[01:16:09.620 --> 01:16:13.220]
And people with scream about free speech and about the fascism of the Bush administration.

[01:16:13.220 --> 01:16:17.220]
And they're trying to clamp down on their colleagues who work on the same damn, uh,

[01:16:17.420 --> 01:16:19.880]
who eat out of the same trough that they're sucking food out of.

[01:16:20.060 --> 01:16:21.360]
I got no use for them.

[01:16:22.820 --> 01:16:23.440]
You know what I mean?

[01:16:23.660 --> 01:16:23.920]
I'm hit.

[01:16:24.900 --> 01:16:29.760]
Even though I'm sure there are people out there, you know, I talked a lot of people into falling in love with Keith Oberman and watching his show.

[01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:30.400]
And you know what?

[01:16:30.560 --> 01:16:31.340]
Have a good time with him.

[01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:31.600]
Okay.

[01:16:32.360 --> 01:16:33.040]
Enjoy it.

[01:16:33.220 --> 01:16:34.880]
Well, I feel so bad about not starting then.

[01:16:35.520 --> 01:16:37.000]
Now, you watched him a few times.

[01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:37.420]
Come on.

[01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:39.680]
But, you know, it's just on at a bad time for me.

[01:16:40.540 --> 01:16:41.140]
Why is that?

[01:16:41.140 --> 01:16:42.760]
What else is on between eight and nine?

[01:16:43.220 --> 01:16:46.680]
Well, eight o'clock there are a lot of shows on that the family would rather be watching.

[01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:47.100]
Like what?

[01:16:48.020 --> 01:16:49.480]
Like sitcoms and things.

[01:16:50.020 --> 01:16:50.460]
sitcoms.

[01:16:50.460 --> 01:16:51.740]
Or you should let the letter out of that.

[01:16:51.920 --> 01:16:52.360]
Yeah.

[01:16:52.780 --> 01:17:02.020]
Those of us with families do things with our families as, you know, as a group that don't involve everyone sitting in the other room watching something different.

[01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:03.040]
I see.

[01:17:03.440 --> 01:17:03.440]

[01:17:04.220 --> 01:17:10.140]
Is this the real reason Fox News asked yesterday why Rosio Donnell is no longer on the view before playing a YouTube video?

[01:17:10.140 --> 01:17:16.740]
A video of O'Donnell warming up a audience by ranting about suspicious events he says were omitted from the 911 commission report.

[01:17:17.340 --> 01:17:23.020]
Most accounts of state that O'Donnell's departure was due to an on air fight over Iraq with co-host Elizabeth Hasselbeck.

[01:17:23.300 --> 01:17:34.860]
The Fox hosts speculate that the video might have come from an audience member's cell phone and then comment briefly on how people go off on this topic when Rosio talks about the World Trade Center Building number seven before cutting to a story about a giant lizard.

[01:17:36.120 --> 01:17:36.940]
I see.

[01:17:37.740 --> 01:17:46.100]
The video was also posted that the screw loose change blog which characterized O'Donnell is raving about World Trade Center seven being omitted from the 911 commission report.

[01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:52.020]
Adding like the 911 commission was concerned about a building in which nobody died, which was not a direct target of the attacks.

[01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:58.280]
Loose change is an internet documentary, which of course we have on our website, Neil Rogers, dot com, and we've had on there for what about 100 years.

[01:17:59.720 --> 01:18:11.880]
Which has received widespread press coverage over the last couple of years, although many 911 truth movement activists have criticized prior edits of the documentary, including a since removed section which claimed video proof that the World Trade Center had been blown up.

[01:18:12.220 --> 01:18:18.920]
Billionaire Mark Cuban is playing to finance a theatrical release after its latest edit with actor Charlie Sheen possibly providing narration.

[01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:20.820]
How do you like that? He's from the Sheenie elves.

[01:18:20.820 --> 01:18:30.320]
And anyway, the notion that the 911 commission report does not mention WTC is wrong. Pat at screw loose change rights before sending four references to it, including the page numbers.

[01:18:30.600 --> 01:18:38.540]
However, none of these selections before the destruction of World Trade Center seven, which has perplexed many scientists government investigators and architects over the years.

[01:18:39.300 --> 01:18:45.960]
Never in the history of the world is a building fallen from a fire on a wits own footprint, eliminating the core 25 steel beams O'Donnell said during the war.

[01:18:45.960 --> 01:18:49.740]
And the problem is that the number of physics wise, she said such an occurrence is impossible. You know what else she said?

[01:18:49.920 --> 01:18:51.880]
A couple of times she said that.

[01:18:52.920 --> 01:19:06.860]
Reporting for New York magazine last November, Mark Jacobson noted that along with the 911 commission report, WTC seven was also given much shrift in the subsequent final report on the Collapsal World Trade Center towers, compiled by the National Institute of Standards Technology, NIST.

[01:19:07.560 --> 01:19:18.880]
Dr. S. Shane Sunder, head of NIST told Jacobson they had preliminary hypotheses regarding World Trade Center seven and are studying the horizontal movement east to west in turn of the structure on the fifth to seventh floors.

[01:19:19.360 --> 01:19:24.060]
But truthfully, everybody don't know Sunder admitted we've had trouble getting a handle on building number seven.

[01:19:24.180 --> 01:19:26.080]
It was an accident that when nobody got hurt.

[01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:35.800]
Sunder told Jacobson that the building's omission from the report was only a matter of staffing and budget and they hoped to release something on seven WTC by the end of the year.

[01:19:36.020 --> 01:19:38.620]
However, no NIST explanations have ever been released as of yet.

[01:19:39.900 --> 01:19:43.940]
And they have the clip on here of Rosie on this story. It's on our website, it's on theorages.com.

[01:19:43.940 --> 01:19:49.200]
What you ought to go to the headline is Foxing just Rosie fired over a leaked video of that 11 talk from the raw story. It's on there.

[01:19:49.480 --> 01:19:55.080]
It's going to take a puke at it now. If you can, if you write it lunch time, if you can handle looking at her during lunch or just before it.

[01:19:55.500 --> 01:20:02.600]
It's about to die. It's a good idea. Lose your appetite in two seconds. That cow is disgusting, obnoxious, loud. Oh, daiky.

[01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:09.920]
See, that's what I'm wondering is why do all the people who say the right things have to be so, I mean like Michael Moore, I love him but he is a big fat slob.

[01:20:09.920 --> 01:20:14.900]
Sure. And I love him but he people pick on it because he looks at he's discussed that right.

[01:20:16.560 --> 01:20:22.000]
And all the people who say the right things tend to be it's like the atheist movement same thing like Christopher Hitchens, man.

[01:20:22.340 --> 01:20:26.920]
I mean, I'm always bitching about Christopher Hitchens. And yet he says a lot of stuff like the article I read last week.

[01:20:27.060 --> 01:20:39.820]
Right. It is some right on it. But when you're dealing with these get's keys, man, with this religious movement, that's why you need to travel around the rest of the world and see that, you know, in civilized places where people are saying and don't run around shooting each other with guns like it.

[01:20:39.820 --> 01:20:45.580]
And when these drive through, they're not into this religious craft so much. And if they are, they keep it themselves.

[01:20:45.980 --> 01:20:50.640]
They're not trying to push it on anybody else, even an Italy man, they give the Italian salute to the Pope.

[01:20:50.800 --> 01:20:55.780]
They seem coming down the street and they give the old Bafangula, you know, can't say that. I just did.

[01:20:56.300 --> 01:21:04.380]
Oh, it's Italian. We don't know what that means. I have no idea. I know the Italian salute though with the hand and the what do you call that?

[01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:07.600]
The fingertips and the chin there. No, that's not the answer.

[01:21:07.600 --> 01:21:18.960]
Oh, not that one. They have several on the inside of the elbow. Oh, that one. Yeah, the Italian salute, not that thing on a chin. That's a mob thing, man. Well, you pick up the Italian again and doing it.

[01:21:19.080 --> 01:21:26.720]
The mob I guess they're not Italian. That's for damn sure. Not my or Lansky. He wasn't a Italian and neither was what's his name? The dead one. What's his name?

[01:21:27.620 --> 01:21:36.380]
Warren Buffett. I mean, Warren, baby. What that was is bugs. He buggy. Don't sound too gracious to me. I bet he knew how to do that salute though.

[01:21:37.280 --> 01:21:47.180]
They all knew the Italian. So that's what they had to do when they got made like Joey. What's his name? Zazah. No, not Joey Zaz. That little guy. Chopeshi. Good fellows. Chopeshi.

[01:21:47.940 --> 01:21:52.060]
Hey, let's 10 25. Please help. I'm pretty sure you're going to be able to. Sounds awfully fishy to me.

[01:21:53.180 --> 01:22:03.620]
A thousand twenty five votes on a pool. I just come out of my noon. I'm thinking twelve fifty just to be on the safe side. Okay. Chris, is that is that me with your expectations or what? Well, if you want twelve fifty, I'll go for thirteen.

[01:22:05.100 --> 01:22:14.500]
So listen, if you can make thirteen again today with a thousand twenty five of this juncture, I will tip my captain. Okay. I'll go out and get I got a baseball captain in the other room from some horseball team.

[01:22:14.500 --> 01:22:22.840]
Not the marvans and I don't even know what it is. And I'll tip my captain. I want that to be quite an honor to be having the legendary.

[01:22:23.180 --> 01:22:28.640]
What's this thing in Orange County Florida that keeps you here on scene? It must be something really marginal. We'll call that a resort in the field.

[01:22:28.840 --> 01:22:37.560]
East of Disney again, not a Disney resort. Yeah. The deputies have what are described as non life threatening injuries. The deputies have been taken to a local hospital.

[01:22:37.560 --> 01:22:46.300]
And we also understand as you can see, maybe so just a moment ago on pictures that the search continues right now for two suspects. Of course, we will continue to.

[01:22:46.300 --> 01:22:53.580]
Well, let us know when something important happens. This is pretty quick. Whenever I shape my ball, I listen to the Neil Rogers twelve to one hour.

[01:22:53.660 --> 01:22:53.960]
All right.

[01:23:05.900 --> 01:23:16.200]
I think they're really great. I doubt that you can't handle one or two much less or eight.

[01:23:16.200 --> 01:23:28.500]
It sounds that you hate. From then from the boys, they will surely separate. I tell you what they are. Guarantee you'll go.

[01:23:28.880 --> 01:23:44.860]
Yeah. I like fingernails on a blackboard. When people crack their neck for their knuckles. When I rub, I will fall together. That just makes me.

[01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:58.280]
I can't stand. Would you tolerate it? You are half the man I am. And to the list of eight.

[01:23:58.280 --> 01:24:08.800]
A fork and a knife scraping on a plate scraping on a plate scraping on a plate scraping on a plate.

[01:24:10.640 --> 01:24:21.660]
Here's one I really love. You might want to try it. Give me feedback in my headphones.

[01:24:21.660 --> 01:24:29.360]
Oh yeah. That's more like it. Little more. Little more over there. Little more.

[01:24:30.200 --> 01:24:38.700]
Yeah. It sounds so unique. Now let's review so you can really, really free.

[01:25:10.060 --> 01:25:21.180]
Yeah. You can't hold on. If he sounds give you the shivers. That makes you a whiner.

[01:25:22.940 --> 01:25:30.500]
Hey, you've got nothing. Someone bite their fork like this. Cause I love it. Here. I'm doing it again.

[01:25:30.500 --> 01:25:38.360]
Do you have a nervous system left? How about a squeegee wipe in a window while I crack my neck?

[01:25:42.660 --> 01:25:48.260]
Sup, are you with? Sup or with? Oh wait. I got one more.

[01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:58.240]
Can we always have that? Always have it reserved. Provo 205 60.0 to QN. Happy Wednesday.

[01:25:58.580 --> 01:26:03.080]
El Trante de Mayo. What do you have to tell me? It's 30th of May. Wow.

[01:26:03.800 --> 01:26:10.020]
Time has marched along toward that summer schedule, George. I know. There he goes again. I'm talking about getting all that time off right.

[01:26:10.020 --> 01:26:17.920]
And anybody who would say that you know what they are beside stupid jealous jealous jealousy that that I wonder who sang that.

[01:26:17.960 --> 01:26:23.200]
Billy Joe. You won't you won't have that in your collection. I'll tell you that. That's an old song.

[01:26:23.880 --> 01:26:35.720]
Jell. I will see. Police said at Tuscola County, Father used the popular MySpace.com website to help find his missing 60 year old daughter allegedly kidnapped by her mother three years ago.

[01:26:36.780 --> 01:26:42.880]
Brian Sebal, 26, reunited with his daughter Brianna Sebal, last week at Seattle to come international airport.

[01:26:43.720 --> 01:26:53.040]
Sebal brought his daughter home to the tiny town of Tuscola last Wednesday. More than three years after he said he saw the lawyer last living with her mother in Tuscacab in Genesee County.

[01:26:54.420 --> 01:27:03.660]
It's been three years since I've talked to my daughter on the phone. So imagine not talking to one of your kids for three years, missing her first day of school and several birthdays. Christmas is another holiday as you told the times.

[01:27:04.300 --> 01:27:11.480]
Brianna and I have a lot of catching up to do. He said Brian Sebal said he never married Dolce M candy Sebal 34.

[01:27:14.280 --> 01:27:25.520]
Now you're you're just smirking because it sounds like a hooker or a stripper sure does candy Sebal's week will ain't over that bond and show snow homie County jail and ever Washington snow homie.

[01:27:26.860 --> 01:27:40.300]
Where's that heinous. Brian Sebal also said he's the father of Dolce Sebal three year old son Sarandon Sebal. He said Dolce began using Sebal as her legal last name after divorce from another man. Dolce she's sweet.

[01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:48.000]
Not Asian or snow homie County. I can't even. Careful. I mean, yeah, that whole thing in the great Northwest.

[01:27:49.020 --> 01:27:56.440]
Aston. Now, homie County Sheriff's Office spoke to them and said police considered Dolce Sebal to fugitive and said the suspect is not fighting extradition to Michigan.

[01:27:57.460 --> 01:28:04.280]
The Skola County prosecutor Mark Reenie said he isn't sure yet if you'll try to extradite Dolce to Michigan where he could arrange around a charge of custodial interference.

[01:28:04.680 --> 01:28:08.140]
The felony cares the maximum sentence of one year and one day in jail.

[01:28:10.100 --> 01:28:18.340]
Reenie said social service officials instead of Washington couldn't and or wouldn't disclose Dolce's address even after he made phone calls to Washington state seeking the suspect's location.

[01:28:18.540 --> 01:28:23.720]
They ain't telling. They talking about Dolce because she's sweet. Maybe she's cooperating.

[01:28:25.240 --> 01:28:29.820]
You know how some of them pull you sorry, you know, you cooperate with him. Polies and do all the right things.

[01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:35.460]
You might get you know if you let them get there where you might get you're right. Get away.

[01:28:35.980 --> 01:28:43.580]
Now we're going to play the audio from that. Read a book. Read and I guess I watched it. I watched it though. I didn't I didn't put the audio on because I got a plug in my speakers.

[01:28:43.680 --> 01:28:51.420]
Yeah, I don't want to do that. I correct my mind. You know, read a mother's and book. Right. Yeah, that bad. It's good stuff. That'd be bad.

[01:28:52.860 --> 01:29:03.040]
1046 is what we got on the pool. Now forget what about 150. I don't know. Maybe you got a shot of 13. I have no idea because if you keep pulling off that that late magic man.

[01:29:03.740 --> 01:29:12.400]
It's like those comeback teams in sports. Those late magic teams. You know what I'm saying? No. Read a book. Read a mother's fraction. Read a book.

[01:29:12.400 --> 01:29:21.000]
I wouldn't I wouldn't be a mom. We always got the button. You know, that's good. I like that. Read a mother's fraction book. Not a magazine.

[01:29:29.620 --> 01:29:39.240]
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

E � wastати underscore lately,

[01:31:24.360 --> 01:31:31.920]
days and you were fooling me for a while.

[01:31:34.040 --> 01:31:38.020]
Was you doing a jogger?

[01:31:38.020 --> 01:31:38.020]

[01:31:38.020 --> 01:31:38.020]

[01:31:38.020 --> 01:31:38.920]
Um, something you know?

[01:31:38.920 --> 01:31:39.040]
We're playing a little game over

[01:31:39.040 --> 01:31:42.900]
out of one oh five three i would you like to get away the way uh... christ is

[01:31:42.900 --> 01:31:45.840]
got one oh five six the not just coming in by the ones anymore

[01:31:45.840 --> 01:31:48.400]
they come in chunks of threes and fours and

[01:31:48.400 --> 01:31:50.580]
five and sevens and stuff

[01:31:51.600 --> 01:31:54.880]
now whatever you've done it i know your computer was it suppose that i

[01:31:54.880 --> 01:31:56.200]
thought it was supposed to be the

[01:31:56.200 --> 01:31:59.800]
the computer expert but what's what's your uh... claim to fame on it

[01:31:59.800 --> 01:32:00.780]

[01:33:23.580 --> 01:33:25.740]
of the long-running c i league controversy

[01:33:26.200 --> 01:33:29.260]
valory plan was the asserts was a covert c i offer sir

[01:33:32.920 --> 01:33:35.040]
scratch a relationship with the agency newsweek be saying

[01:33:36.040 --> 01:33:39.700]
not a magazine now that's not gonna count a book a real book with a hard cover

[01:33:39.700 --> 01:33:41.700]
or like even a paperback would be good

[01:33:43.120 --> 01:33:46.540]
willson's covert status which is substantially an employment report filed by

[01:33:46.540 --> 01:33:47.040]
fit zero

[01:33:47.040 --> 01:33:50.120]

scooter liby to up to three years in prison

[01:33:53.300 --> 01:33:56.960]
according to that report plain traveled sometimes intrudement sometimes an

[01:33:56.960 --> 01:34:00.220]
alex but always using cover whether official or not official with no

[01:34:00.220 --> 01:34:02.080]
ostensible relationship to the c i a

[01:34:11.820 --> 01:34:15.700]
thousand three miss Wilson was a covert c i employed for whom the c i was

[01:34:15.700 --> 01:34:18.900]
taken affirmative measures to conceal her intelligence relationship to the

[01:34:18.900 --> 01:34:19.560]
u s a

[01:34:20.820 --> 01:34:24.360]
the findings of early hamper's a key defense by liby's lawyers and supporters

[01:34:24.360 --> 01:34:27.880]
who have claimed that since plain was not covered liby had committed no

[01:34:27.880 --> 01:34:30.660]
underlying crime and revealing her identity furthermore

[01:34:30.660 --> 01:34:35.080]
washed in post-connist dan frumkin noted that fits jr's court filing further

[01:34:35.080 --> 01:34:38.180]
points to vice president cheney's involvement in the outing of claim

[01:34:39.320 --> 01:34:42.640]
special counsel fits jr has made it clearer than ever that he was hot on the

[01:34:42.640 --> 01:34:46.780]
trail of a coordinated campaign to out-ci i agent Valerie plain rights frumkin

[01:34:46.780 --> 01:34:50.560]
until that line of investigation was cut off by the repeated lies from vice

[01:34:50.560 --> 01:34:53.480]
president cheney's former chief of staff scooter liby

[01:34:54.040 --> 01:34:57.520]
frumkin at the response to charges of liby's prosecution was unmovated

[01:34:57.520 --> 01:35:00.780]
the special counsel evidently felt obliged to believe his crime in context

[01:35:00.780 --> 01:35:05.200]
and that context is dick cheney how do you like that the crooked chief

[01:35:05.200 --> 01:35:09.600]
other guys just a dumbbell k he's just the face man the face of ignorance and

[01:35:09.600 --> 01:35:10.140]
believe me

[01:35:10.800 --> 01:35:12.100]
he doesn't have a good job of that

[01:35:12.100 --> 01:35:16.040]
uh... downloading some david has a lot of music for you later all right let's

[01:35:16.040 --> 01:35:17.080]
that can't wait for that

[01:35:17.840 --> 01:35:20.620]
as part of our new music format sure won't have to wait long

[01:35:20.620 --> 01:35:23.720]
and fact i got a good idea let's play some tapes of me playing music

[01:35:24.300 --> 01:35:24.840]
that'd be great

[01:35:24.840 --> 01:35:29.000]
to have a tape to be playing some leys Miguel from hundred years ago and i think

[01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:32.800]
we might have been sixty six one by the bottom of the hour to be real close to

[01:35:32.800 --> 01:35:33.320]
eleven hundred

[01:35:33.900 --> 01:35:37.080]
i'm thinking uh... maybe christian artist someone again

[01:35:37.600 --> 01:35:39.980]
when i be something if you do thirteen again

[01:35:40.920 --> 01:35:42.660]
that would be uh...

[01:35:42.660 --> 01:35:43.400]
really hard to do that

[01:35:44.020 --> 01:35:44.900]
what would be

[01:35:44.900 --> 01:35:46.800]
might be a little hard to get thirteen today

[01:35:46.800 --> 01:35:48.200]
why is that

[01:35:48.200 --> 01:35:51.100]
well you know two days in a row middle of the week people you know

[01:35:51.100 --> 01:35:54.840]

[01:36:13.140 --> 01:36:13.500]
factor

[01:36:16.140 --> 01:36:17.500]
and

[01:36:17.500 --> 01:36:18.100]
he's the man

[01:36:18.620 --> 01:36:22.180]
the man with a lot of guns

[01:36:24.220 --> 01:36:27.020]
he keeps for fun

[01:36:29.660 --> 01:36:33.300]

[01:36:36.220 --> 01:36:37.440]

[01:36:43.520 --> 01:36:45.420]

[01:37:32.740 --> 01:37:33.080]
and

[01:37:33.080 --> 01:37:33.920]
and

[01:37:33.920 --> 01:37:34.100]
and

[01:37:35.160 --> 01:37:35.620]
and

i didn't do anything to it

[01:37:51.040 --> 01:37:52.280]

[01:37:58.880 --> 01:38:00.440]
it's just by itself

[01:38:01.360 --> 01:38:02.340]
i did not

[01:38:02.340 --> 01:38:04.880]

getting ripped off that way yeah I do yeah you're cheated Josh Cordis will be here with you know

[01:51:21.380 --> 01:51:24.940]
telling all the stories about his Russian girlfriend and all the life he applies her with and

[01:51:24.940 --> 01:51:29.800]
how she does he has to does that just about anything out of his young kind of tacky if he asked me I've

[01:51:29.800 --> 01:51:37.920]
heard those stories now but you have probably seen it too 1115 old bean so I think I think 13 is

[01:51:37.920 --> 01:51:42.200]
within your reach Chris I think you've been so magical and so powerful this week that it's a

[01:51:44.060 --> 01:51:49.480]
possibility and then again who he gives a flying leaf yeah a mother flying mother flying leaf I do

[01:51:49.480 --> 01:51:55.880]
this way somebody's got to care somebody in his god for second places got a good damn you've got to

[01:52:03.100 --> 01:52:03.920]
hobby off the

[01:52:11.300 --> 01:52:12.800]
bad choice that is man

[01:52:17.640 --> 01:52:22.560]
man ask this question how come there's no dark folks in the world family are you kidding me

[01:52:22.560 --> 01:52:26.120]
at all I'm Germans in there the Baton berth what do you mean am I kidding I'm gonna sit on

[01:52:26.120 --> 01:52:30.360]
this question they're in bread as it is you think they're gonna let any outside blood in there

[01:52:30.360 --> 01:52:34.340]
the brits is because they're much erases bastards and they've done everything all over the world

[01:52:34.340 --> 01:52:38.920]
from South Africa to India to Australia and everywhere they went all over the world the

[01:52:38.920 --> 01:52:43.760]
royals don't want to mix in with non-royals I see they don't want the impurities in there as well

[01:52:43.760 --> 01:52:49.980]
as though that common blood in there bastards racist best doctors and of course a bunch of

[01:52:49.980 --> 01:52:53.780]
losers themselves I'm sure that any respectable dark folks would want to be related to them anyway

[01:52:54.320 --> 01:52:59.760]
the royal family my ass that I'm not just disgusting queen with her little purse

[01:53:00.360 --> 01:53:04.080]
but then again you know if you if you ever wonder why I say the world is a crazy place and it's sick

[01:53:04.080 --> 01:53:08.080]
forget about all these people dying forget about all the religious gitskis killing each other because

[01:53:08.080 --> 01:53:12.260]
they're got as better than my god but just think about the brits and all this crap with the

[01:53:12.260 --> 01:53:16.400]
world and the queen did this and prince philos did that but it'd be better but it would put a

[01:53:16.400 --> 01:53:22.800]
who gives a flying crap okay right but your stuffy silly ass brits hey who did that schmiff

[01:53:22.800 --> 01:53:28.880]
john see song you were talking about earlier jell the sea that that that that you got it no by whom

[01:53:29.340 --> 01:53:35.280]
i don't have any idea i mean i got a lot of jealousy songs just not that that one how do you know

[01:53:35.280 --> 01:53:38.780]
you don't have that one well because i looked for it and the only jealousy songs i have are from

[01:53:38.780 --> 01:53:44.960]
people that uh you wouldn't have mentioned what is it wouldn't have said jealousy by Natalie

[01:53:44.960 --> 01:53:50.480]
merchant for example no or hey jealousy by the gym blossoms you probably wouldn't have said that either

[01:53:50.480 --> 01:53:56.080]
no that's good song is it really we don't want to hear it's okay it's a good song we don't

[01:53:56.160 --> 01:54:02.220]
the only good song we want to hear is that and of course a read a book read a mother's scratch and

[01:54:02.220 --> 01:54:10.040]
work oh yeah it's one thing to listen to it it's another thing to actually watch it that little

[01:54:10.040 --> 01:54:14.240]
lot of thing there that website you're the man now dog a lot of teenagers and young adults

[01:54:23.740 --> 01:54:25.640]
only when they do it right up my alley selling

[01:54:56.060 --> 01:54:57.100]
oh

[01:54:57.100 --> 01:55:02.800]
i'm really surprised that you do not deny because you were that

[01:55:02.800 --> 01:55:09.940]
dumb you accomplished nothing and it became a media superstar

[01:55:11.980 --> 01:55:20.520]
i would have asked you to make a 20 but can't no more and now the proper media has something

[01:55:20.520 --> 01:55:25.260]
other to pitch outside a crazy pamper wearing asking not to

[01:55:26.340 --> 01:55:31.340]
uh-oh better watch it some pretty raunchy language in there 16 before two a one or two that

[01:55:31.340 --> 01:55:35.460]
was a Freudian slip see there he goes again that's all he cares about is getting off that chair

[01:55:35.460 --> 01:55:40.360]
and going filling his face with a fatening lunch that's what you think no fatening lunch is this

[01:55:40.360 --> 01:55:45.620]

[01:55:45.620 --> 01:55:51.980]
legs i'm telling you you're right about that about that thing that's on it's addictive but wait

[01:55:51.980 --> 01:55:52.800]

how many vote we got on here like i said 11th graders see every time open up a

[01:56:45.160 --> 01:56:49.760]
muffin you're really optimistic that all of a sudden the air kits that break people don't believe

[01:56:49.760 --> 01:56:53.580]
that he's got that on there he he once told me that he can make the vote any any number he wants

[01:56:53.580 --> 01:57:00.140]
that's right any result he wants also really sure he can manipulate it how about that he can add

[01:57:00.140 --> 01:57:05.440]
from one to a million votes to any entry or any combination thereup now let me tell you the great

[01:57:05.440 --> 01:57:09.800]
part about this rapper thing is in and you know something as much as i hate rap music i do like

[01:57:10.880 --> 01:57:13.780]
oh i know you've made exceptions in the past which is um

[01:57:14.880 --> 01:57:19.800]
oh i had to get that off of the real bad yeah you shouldn't paint uh all of it with a broad brush

[01:57:19.800 --> 01:57:24.780]
you know meaning what that there are various kinds and and you've liked some of it so i have

[01:57:24.780 --> 01:57:28.900]
liked some of it but most of it gen gen gen we don't always generalize we do and generally speaking

[01:57:28.900 --> 01:57:34.080]
it's uh not good it's like when you say fish i hate fish but i do like tuna fish sure okay lobster

[01:57:34.640 --> 01:57:38.960]

sounded like shim when we were talking about the Ethan schoenix toilet oh my god yeah you know

[01:58:15.320 --> 01:58:19.680]
something when when when the management people and joys have driven you into the toilet i guess

[01:58:19.680 --> 01:58:23.360]
that's that's where your mind is man that's what you start talking about they accuse us of being

years though not without problems

[02:10:59.660 --> 02:11:03.080]
although the military continues to publicly claim the vaccine is safe and effective

[02:11:03.080 --> 02:11:07.520]
thousands of soldiers have suffered adverse reactions ranging from mild to severe

[02:11:08.800 --> 02:11:12.300]

granted biothracks special protection under its support anti-terrorism by fostering effective

[02:11:38.320 --> 02:11:43.020]
technology act or safety act it was the first vaccine to receive protection under the act

[02:11:43.020 --> 02:11:47.220]
according to an immersion press release the act certifies biothracks as an approved product

[02:11:47.220 --> 02:11:50.900]
for Homeland Security and provides significant liability protection to the event of vaccines

[02:11:50.900 --> 02:11:56.300]
administered to civilians in terrorist attack after an initial contact with the atost

[02:12:10.940 --> 02:12:14.560]
ranking health officials with close ties to the Bush administration helped a Michigan-based

[02:12:14.560 --> 02:12:19.020]
pharmaceutical companies secure a sole source multi-million dollar federal contracts for the

[02:12:19.020 --> 02:12:24.960]
purchase of its controversial anthrax vaccine I just mentioned that in passing not that this whole

[02:12:24.960 --> 02:12:28.500]

1206 Chris 1206 they just took a puke over there while I was busy talking about anthrax

[02:12:44.960 --> 02:12:49.680]
and of course you remember the guy whoa and then speaking of cheese had Tommy Thompson nobody

[02:12:49.680 --> 02:12:53.840]
talks about he's running anyway you don't want to know why nobody notice is just silly

[02:12:55.180 --> 02:12:59.580]
cheeseheads running oh he drank water out of a creek he was an outdoors guy yeah he got he died

[02:12:59.580 --> 02:13:05.460]
from the anthrax in the envelope you jackass you moron you're cypillars cheesehead you're fairy right

[02:13:05.460 --> 02:13:14.060]
that too let's see provost some we need 93 votes we got 53 minutes that's way under two a minute

[02:13:14.500 --> 02:13:18.760]
I think Chris is suckered you people did it again I don't think he can do it see if I use

[02:13:18.760 --> 02:13:22.900]
the same psychology I use yesterday they'll prove me wrong anything they can do to prove me wrong

[02:13:22.900 --> 02:13:28.500]
and you know what that's fine with me and you know talk about creatures of habit although there

[02:13:28.500 --> 02:13:33.800]
is a reason for though because my mage shows up at two o'clock on Wednesdays which is why I did the

[02:13:33.800 --> 02:13:38.900]
wood by Wednesday thing in the first place right because I got to get out of here but I got my shirt

[02:13:38.900 --> 02:13:44.240]
and my pantaloonies on now it's only one or seven because ordinarily where would I be going at two

[02:13:44.240 --> 02:13:52.820]
o'clock not today not today no no nickels no pennies no no two penny machines no dollar

[02:13:52.820 --> 02:13:56.920]
machines no five dollar machine and see the thing it falls you and I recalls their five dollar

[02:13:56.920 --> 02:14:02.220]
machines are three coin machines unlike any other place that's close to civilized so instead of

[02:14:02.220 --> 02:14:10.080]
ten bucks a pop it's fifteen bucks every time you hit the button I see so every time every time

[02:14:10.080 --> 02:14:15.000]
you hit the button fifteen bucks so your money goes by like like that that's it yeah in a heartbeat

[02:14:16.500 --> 02:14:20.100]
put a hundred dollar bill in there it's like like you just you know farted

[02:14:21.320 --> 02:14:24.900]

[02:14:57.640 --> 02:15:04.600]
