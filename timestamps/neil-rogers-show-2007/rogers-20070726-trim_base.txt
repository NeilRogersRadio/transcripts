[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.080]
And if you have like a bad VM you can even smear it on your back home. Oh, it's all it's smear it all around

[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.780]
What was gonna have that back when you made your decision for Christ absolutely

[00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.040]
For Jim novel man everybody picking on crazy Jim

[00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:56.660]
Because now his cousin's dead I'll ball it in the head

[00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.380]
What happened we don't know

[00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.100]
Something fish he smells but he won't tell

[00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.540]
Well as Brian

[00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260]
What did you do?

[00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.940]
Brian

[00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.360]
What did you do?

[00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.980]
See

[00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.820]
It's not so long

[00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.620]
He was standing on his folks

[00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.440]
And he was crying

[00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.020]
Brian

[00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.540]
Brian

[00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:35.600]
Brian

[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.760]
It's hard to understand

[00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.040]
It was an accident

[00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.120]
You shut's lion

[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.880]
I don't know why

[00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.160]
Your age improved

[00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.540]
claims the cops reports on truth

[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:04.260]
I want to know some more so tell me what's the score

[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.760]
Brian

[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.160]
What did you do?

[00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:12.020]
Accidentally

[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.020]
Or just maybe

[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.180]
Yeah

[00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.100]
Oh

[00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.120]
What did you do?

[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.200]
Yes

[00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.760]
Now he's gone

[00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.600]
And from this moment on

[00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.340]
We're asking why

[00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.840]
Brian

[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:41.560]
Papa

[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.920]
You fairy

[00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.320]
Come on Brian fish up baby

[00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.440]
Okay, 1003 at 560

[00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.040]
I'm happy Thursday to it's another one of our 50% restaurant deals today at noon

[00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.680]
Are you excited about that? I bet you won't sure and today it's what is it Joseph?

[00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:24.040]
Joseph sense right

[00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.020]
I'm just checking to see if you're on top of things okay. Yeah, this is like here about it

[00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:34.800]
I mean that thing this morning I'm sitting in here and waiting to tell you that I had a run to the bank and I we gone for a few minutes

[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.800]
And so then I find out that my you know bank suck

[00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.320]
Yeah, but not like there was a yeah

[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.460]
They open whenever the hell they feel like it they pose whenever they feel like it

[00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:52.760]
I mean you like minimum service and like screw you and oh the thing I never heard of before but I've discovered here is that if you make a cash deposit in an ATM

[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.420]
They hold it for five days

[00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:00.280]
I wouldn't anybody out there got some cash I'll be happy to hold it for five days

[00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:06.100]
In fact, you got anything else good I'll hold that for five days maybe even five minutes might be good probably long enough

[00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:11.060]
But at any rate I hear Kenny and Bo Randall on again about Jim Noggle was obsessed

[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:12.320]
Obsessed

[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.240]
They're in love I wouldn't be surprised if the two of them eat lope

[00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:18.780]
So would Jim Noggle

[00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.560]
Maybe they can have like a three way in a public tea room somewhere

[00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.500]
Wouldn't put it past and anybody that's that obsessed with you know banana business

[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.100]
Well, he's obsessed with I'll tell you one thing vote campers obsessed with toilet business

[00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.800]
They were they went into a long thing before they got back on a Jim Noggle and Kenny

[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.960]
Kenny informed the audience that he loves gay people

[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.800]
It's about he love you can't you're an idiot okay deserve to get came that shows off in another month by the way

[00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:48.800]
I just thought of a mention it not because the Jim Noggle is because it sucks and their numbers have been pathetic except for one month out of how long they've been on way too long

[00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.600]
So like I said a few years ago was going to get canceled

[00:04:51.600 --> 00:05:00.100]
We'll get to that Joe Rose business very jackasses a very perspicacious column is usual because Barry is the only one anybody talks to if you want to know what's going on in the

[00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:06.320]
Arradio business in South Florida read Barry jackass. Hey Barry. That's right because he's the only one with his little brown sack

[00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:13.680]
Who knows what's going on in Arradio some sent a little gave up they fired fat ass Jim Serny they blew him out

[00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:18.580]
And so nobody there I mean once in a while twice a year time jitter write something about radio

[00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:24.860]
But you know it's usually nothing that anybody cares about nice going Tommy the best little horror house is not in pain's

[00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:29.580]
Velo a hyal now this is something Jim Noggle better pay attention to this might solve the problem

[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.340]
And municipal judge Michael

[00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:34.460]
Sitchin itty

[00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:40.060]
No predispensing unusual sentences doesn't want one sprouting in his small town a horror house that is

[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:47.340]
Because if you have a horror house something else sprouts in your town so chicken itty and that interesting with his name is

[00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:59.340]
I know the brother chicken George story well no way to get to the meat of this you order three-man charge with soliciting sex to take turns dressing in bright yellow chicken costumes while

[00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:06.080]
Carrying a sign that reads no chicken ranch in Painsville chicken Eddie got it I'm probably not saying his name right and who

[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:11.660]
He'll cares the sign in costume referred to the world famous chicken ranch or prostitution house in Nevada where sex

[00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:13.920]
From money is legal at least in certain places

[00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:19.700]
Painsville borrowed the costume from a woman who wears it to cheer patients up at a local hospice the chicken costume

[00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:26.200]
Daniel well-scout the names of these guys all clearly guilty a Wednesday to Mr. Meener charges of soliciting sex with another cover

[00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:31.040]
Painsville police officer earlier this summer chicken a degree to suspend a 30-day jail sentence

[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:37.460]
I'm 30 man. They were the costume between four and seven p.m. Tomorrow outside Painsville City Court. This is Painsville Ohio

[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:43.580]
We're trying to send a strong message that we won't tolerate the activity in the city said Painsville probation supervisor David

[00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:44.300]
Washlock

[00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:49.220]
It's not the first time chicken that he's used barguit animals in his sentences

[00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:54.220]
You ordered a man who called a policeman of pig to stand next to a live pig in a pen and hold a sign that reads

[00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:59.240]
This is not a police officer a couple who stole a baby Jesus statue from a manger

[00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:02.440]
We're sentenced to dress as Mary and Joseph and walk with a donkey

[00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:07.160]
Sounds to me like this judge is a real ass. Maybe they could have walked with his ass

[00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:08.680]
Wow

[00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:13.700]
So we're not the best little horrors and the no chicken ranch in Painsville

[00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:16.440]
Said chicken Eddie got it

[00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:24.440]
A woman screaming you're not a real conservative sir was moved by police from a welcoming reception for likely GOP

[00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:28.320]
Presidential candidate and bad actor Fred Thompson wins the morning a

[00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:32.160]
Second protestor was also taken from the room. This is in Houston

[00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:38.560]
Houston police is scored at the woman as well as a man from the hangar at hobby airport where Thompson was shaking hands with a

[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:44.180]
Count of supporters. They weren't arrested though. They just escorted them out the woman question Thompson as he talked to reporter

[00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:47.540]
She asked him why he was a member of the council on foreign relations probably one of the

[00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.480]
Triad lateral commission in the Illuminati to and maybe one of the builder burgers and

[00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:57.100]
Note that the organization supported the North American Union with Canada and Mexico

[00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:01.120]
After the woman interrupted Thompson by questioning his conservative credentials

[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:04.740]
Like the candidate said don't fuss at me. You asked a question. Let me answer it

[00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:07.480]
He told the woman I try to learn as much as I can from all viewpoints

[00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:08.020]
The

[00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:13.200]
Later she shouted at Thompson as the news conference ended police officers took her outside of fence

[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:19.200]
Area near the hangar and stood with her until the former Tennessee Senator departed kind of like keeping an eye on her ass

[00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:26.860]
Maybe she had a shapely lovely ass who knows all I doubt it. Sorry picture there. She didn't look too attractive to me

[00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:29.660]
But then again, what would I know being the old gay fact that I am?

[00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:36.640]
Yeah, you know, it was interesting Kenny talking just just like picking up for a boat camper left off and they're up

[00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:39.640]
Like I said obsessed with all this crap would you not really love him?

[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:46.800]
About the old how terrible would be to take his little kid into a public restroom and for a lot of the other anywhere else and have two

[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:50.700]
Fags having said Chris never has happened to him obviously because that would be terrible

[00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:56.900]
Yeah, it would also be terrible to see the bathroom door fly open and some fat old man sitting there trying to do his business on a robo toilet

[00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:05.460]
Some fat old man why trying to do his business on a robo toilet because that's what you know again now, which just happened. I don't know

[00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:08.260]
Yeah, you cut out not on you're not

[00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:15.200]
Are we having this problem at the beginning of the show? I mean we're gonna have it all day today. You're even storms and stuff

[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:19.620]
Not since we came in but who knows it's Florida, you know, oh

[00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:25.200]
That's all we need is that to go on all day just right make me little Georgia beyond from one to two

[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:30.420]
I'm getting out of here at one. I can't take all of this. What do you talk about robo toilets? How about robo plus?

[00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:33.860]
I

[00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:36.160]
Think every head of roll guy ought to have one of those

[00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:39.680]
Yeah, I'm hanging out today with my robo puss

[00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:44.940]
The word that best describes my first sexual experience speaking of that according to Georgia's pull against it

[00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:47.280]
He had 828 votes. That's not too bad for you

[00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:50.220]
We're gonna have a really weak day today. Sorry Chris, but

[00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:55.920]
On by the way to one guy on our my space we have 1500 my space friends now Georgia on your problem

[00:09:56.340 --> 00:10:01.060]
Okay, sure one guy on there said he really appreciated this picture of Georgia and Chris's girl for her

[00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:05.920]
Chris does have a girlfriend, but that wasn't her the Russian now. That's no Josh Curtis's girlfriend, okay?

[00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:09.320]
They'll allow you even's out there that think you know something cut the crap

[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:13.540]
That's okay. Someone was asking me yesterday and called me Josh on the phone and he also

[00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:18.560]
Thought that Georgia's like I said on Tuesday Georgia started look really old and pasty and let me start

[00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:21.380]
I look so much better because my skin is so much nicer

[00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:25.080]
That's only then he had some cost to comment to make about facials

[00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:30.780]
You know stuff. I know what you're talking about you perfect the word that best describes my first sexual experience is

[00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:33.240]
Brief 150 or maybe they were wearing their briefs

[00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:39.220]
Incredible 128 in other words, I expected 121 oops

[00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:44.380]
Surprising 72 what's the difference between I guess there's a different I discussed that yeah now

[00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:50.600]
Disappointing 71 forgettable 62 embarrassing 48 drunk in 44

[00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:58.720]
Always a good excuse earth shaking 27 confusing and accidental 8th at 21 accidental oops a lot of oops on here

[00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:03.100]
Like the 15 I wonder how long dirty 13 dirty

[00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:06.700]
Disgusting 11 painful 10s

[00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:08.830]
29 and drug-induced

[00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:12.590]
Solomente syncos hold onto a chinkway only five

[00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:16.990]
How do you like that? We're trialing will hear oh by the way you know Stu gotses now doing the thing on Thursdays

[00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:19.790]
With his two-for-one restaurant deals over the right across the street

[00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:22.910]
They sure are original. I wonder when they started that or do we steal that from them?

[00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:26.770]
I'm sure we didn't steal it because must've been working on the thing for a coons age

[00:11:27.490 --> 00:11:30.690]
We didn't say that to you. Yeah, I did well both can probably rip and meet tomorrow

[00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:36.090]
See it's okay to rip the facts. That's okay because especially among sports circles that's

[00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:37.370]
Politically correct

[00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:42.190]
But if you even make something up where you assume anybody ripped anybody else well

[00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:48.530]
You know you're hiding behind your screwed up there in Toronto and come here and say it to his face. Yeah, no thanks

[00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:50.650]
In fact next time I come down here

[00:11:50.650 --> 00:11:56.550]
I think I'm gonna hang out in some public tea rooms with some of my close personal friends and just have public sex and they have to you know

[00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:59.270]
Just to get Jim Noggle upset probably in for the order to unload out

[00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:03.210]
We'll get to a today's pool Charlie B by the way

[00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:07.910]
We only have 448 votes. What's our goal today 500 Chris? Oh, let's go for sex

[00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:12.930]
Let's go for sex and I'm not going I'm not going with you for sex. I

[00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:14.970]
That's for sure. I know

[00:12:16.010 --> 00:12:19.450]
448 vote is all we got but Charlie B has he's embellished it a little bit

[00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:26.630]
And I think that's an appropriate word by sending me this morning on our my space the towns the cities the places the joints

[00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:29.270]
Where these people are from the Florida-born celebrities

[00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:32.870]
Which he didn't really have to do that and quite frankly I think it's a little over the top

[00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:36.730]
It'll kill some more of the time. Thank you Charlie B how you be Charlie B

[00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:40.850]

[00:37:20.370 --> 00:37:24.570]
when I'm in a wonderful mood and I noticed there's some people get a little

[00:37:24.570 --> 00:37:25.570]
jealous them in a wonderful

[00:37:28.170 --> 00:37:32.830]
jealousy is not a good always the case I beg your pardon ate that always the case

[00:37:32.830 --> 00:37:39.010]
why is that why are the people jealous sounds like a good close personal

[00:37:39.010 --> 00:37:42.730]
friends of mine who I'm starting to detect a little jealousy in some

[00:37:42.730 --> 00:37:46.470]
or no that's right they've been there too long get out of there before it's too

[00:37:46.470 --> 00:37:50.050]
late too late five five hundred and fifty two votes on our pool I think our goal

[00:37:50.050 --> 00:37:55.110]
is six hundred I shouldn't hung up on that lady she saw me a lady call and

[00:37:55.110 --> 00:38:00.310]
no less the very first one right of the box they said Broward County will never

[00:38:00.310 --> 00:38:03.370]
be the same they said history was made hundred this is from the Iskum

[00:38:03.370 --> 00:38:07.330]
Sentinel which by the way they changed their website if you notice that and

[00:38:07.330 --> 00:38:11.210]
really blows the old format was much better much preferable to this new artsy

[00:38:11.210 --> 00:38:15.150]
farcey when it sucks I just thought I mentioned that not that they're going to

[00:38:15.150 --> 00:38:18.590]
listen to me but it really is bad hundreds of people descended on city hall

[00:38:18.590 --> 00:38:22.450]
asked actually not worth Tuesday I'm sorry to announce mayor Jim Noggle for his

[00:38:22.450 --> 00:38:26.070]
record of inflammatory comments most recently about gays although Kenny Walker

[00:38:26.070 --> 00:38:29.430]
on our morning show this morning briefly announced that Jim Noggle loves gay

[00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:35.130]
people to which we all went right a line of broward leaders and government

[00:38:35.130 --> 00:38:38.210]
civil rights of gay rights and religion took the stage Tuesday saying it was

[00:38:38.210 --> 00:38:41.430]
important to let the world know that Noggle doesn't speak for the entire county

[00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:45.530]
or even a city of Fort Lauderdale mayor Noggle speaks only for one very small

[00:38:45.530 --> 00:38:48.810]
person himself said County Commissioner Stacy Ritter one of three County

[00:38:48.810 --> 00:38:52.970]
commissioners who be speaking my name is growing quickly against the 16 year

[00:38:52.970 --> 00:38:55.970]
mayor since he was quoted in the South Florida Sun Sentinel on the 4th of July

[00:38:55.970 --> 00:39:00.130]
about the 250 thousand dollar self-cleaning toilet the city planned it later

[00:39:00.130 --> 00:39:04.230]
next for the beach the mayor said one thing you liked about the robotic

[00:39:04.230 --> 00:39:07.670]
commode was its security features the freestanding toilet with the tour

[00:39:07.670 --> 00:39:11.410]
homosexual activity said of course we know that there's no heterosexual couples

[00:39:11.410 --> 00:39:14.950]
ever having sex on the beach either okay that's okay that's also you took your

[00:39:14.950 --> 00:39:18.610]
kids out there long an evening walk on the beach and there was a heterosexual

[00:39:18.610 --> 00:39:21.850]
couple having sex right there in the sand right on the beach that would be okay

[00:39:21.850 --> 00:39:26.190]
that would be good would be good useful a tool for later in life there'll be a

[00:39:26.190 --> 00:39:31.370]
learning experience or maybe a yearning experience Noggle said public restrooms

[00:39:31.370 --> 00:39:34.370]
are plagued by gay sex in Fort Lauderdale even though police said it's not a

[00:39:34.370 --> 00:39:38.610]
problem he also said he doesn't use the term gay because homosexuals are on

[00:39:38.610 --> 00:39:41.850]
happy even though he loves the gay community according to Kenny Walker who's a

[00:39:41.850 --> 00:39:46.970]
retard a just pathetic we got another month and a plus of them all my god

[00:39:46.970 --> 00:39:52.210]
will never survive it we are doomed oh he didn't say that again Noggle didn't

[00:39:52.210 --> 00:39:55.170]
attend the rally Tuesday but he staged his own news conference earlier in the

[00:39:55.170 --> 00:39:59.210]
day and we already been through that and he apologized but not to gay people

[00:39:59.210 --> 00:40:02.410]
apologize to children in parents of the community for not being aware the problem

[00:40:02.410 --> 00:40:06.870]
he said explain that he found websites advising gays to cruise for sex in two

[00:40:06.870 --> 00:40:11.410]
city park restrooms in the turlits I apologize for not bringing this forward

[00:40:11.410 --> 00:40:15.970]
earlier he said maybe some lives could have been saved county property appraised

[00:40:15.970 --> 00:40:19.490]
a Lori parish a lifetime for Lauderdale resident like Noggle said he was spewing

[00:40:19.490 --> 00:40:22.570]
hate and giving the wrong impression that the county doesn't welcome gays that's

[00:40:22.570 --> 00:40:26.370]
why they like him on our morning show because he's a hate spuer he's a hate

[00:40:26.370 --> 00:40:31.130]
spewing idiot on behalf of the public officials in broder county per se

[00:40:31.130 --> 00:40:34.710]
the rally apologize for him not being man enough to do so she said his

[00:40:34.710 --> 00:40:37.930]
comments galvanize the community though Noggle has been criticized for what

[00:40:37.930 --> 00:40:42.250]
some consider outlined his comments in the past former vice mayor Dean Trent

[00:40:42.250 --> 00:40:46.450]

the National Game of the Intense Force that's why Kenny and Bo like him so

[00:41:43.530 --> 00:41:48.010]
much because he's a bigot and a crazy person and make sure that he has shunned

[00:41:48.010 --> 00:41:51.270]
everywhere he goes not allowed to any gathering where decent people are like in a

[00:41:51.270 --> 00:41:54.390]

[00:45:52.710 --> 00:45:57.610]
gave some thought to Tom Petty he's great had a lot of good songs you put him

[00:45:57.610 --> 00:46:00.170]
in the same league with Jim Morrison is that what you're telling us not what I said

[00:46:00.170 --> 00:46:02.870]

[00:47:16.890 --> 00:47:19.950]

[00:47:19.950 --> 00:47:23.590]
Michael Vick and the dolphins camp opens and they just signed this ten-year-old

[00:47:23.590 --> 00:47:26.370]
quarterback that they drafted instead of Brady Quinn because the Brady

[00:47:26.370 --> 00:47:29.810]
is a rumor to be gay whatever the deal is you know but we don't want to be

[00:47:29.810 --> 00:47:33.470]
knocking the dolphin organization because we have the dolphins on our station

[00:47:33.470 --> 00:47:37.330]
now when you have a team on your station you don't knock the organization by the

[00:47:37.330 --> 00:47:40.990]
way we give away those gift certificates or what yes you know I'm kidding I mean

[00:47:40.990 --> 00:47:46.130]

[00:47:46.130 --> 00:47:50.110]
fifteen hundred friends of my space for McGill we're still here if he got

[00:47:50.110 --> 00:47:53.590]
stabbed in the back and fired he'd probably come in and say give me a

[00:47:53.590 --> 00:47:58.730]
verbal pat on the ass building security speaking speaking rich for a

[00:47:58.730 --> 00:48:03.710]

[00:48:08.490 --> 00:48:14.710]
it's gonna go on and on although I think you stopped cutting out good well

[00:48:14.710 --> 00:48:19.470]
let's say one word no come on let's have a little verbal intercourse here

[00:48:21.630 --> 00:48:25.190]
that's what you're not cutting out which means that somebody did something on

[00:48:25.190 --> 00:48:28.990]
that and I didn't need to do it all that they just enjoy having me caught

[00:48:28.990 --> 00:48:32.370]
around on my hands in the show playing junior engineer which by the way for five

[00:48:32.370 --> 00:48:35.710]

[00:48:35.710 --> 00:48:40.410]
the Toronto under come in here like maybe two or three in a whole time I would say

[00:48:40.410 --> 00:48:47.410]

[00:48:47.410 --> 00:48:52.390]
I'm a freaking genius man when they give me that money twice a month they may not

[00:48:52.390 --> 00:48:54.690]
think they're getting their money's worth because I'm working like about five

[00:48:54.690 --> 00:48:57.730]
hours a year some like that they're getting their money's worth and then some

[00:48:57.730 --> 00:49:04.750]
and if you want an honest opinion just ask me I'll tell you five five hundred

[00:49:04.750 --> 00:49:09.050]

[00:49:17.570 --> 00:49:20.830]
of Jim Nogel again by the way who was a peed on all over this morning on the

[00:49:20.830 --> 00:49:25.150]
Kenny and Voh morning show which is obviously like it what I bet you like that

[00:49:25.150 --> 00:49:28.830]
considering he's in the bathroom business he's definitely the

[00:49:28.830 --> 00:49:33.050]
best but just so his vocamper he's just obsessed with bathrooms and how they

[00:49:33.050 --> 00:49:37.770]
smell and who left the load behind did I ever tell you about my I don't think I

[00:49:37.770 --> 00:49:42.390]
mentioned on the air I wrote about it to one of my correspondence on there to

[00:49:42.390 --> 00:49:45.870]
my favorite online correspondent who's very defensive today but nevertheless

[00:49:46.650 --> 00:49:50.750]
about my uncle read what about it I never talked about you never know I had an

[00:49:50.750 --> 00:49:55.570]
uncle read my father's brother okay he was the black sheep of the family I'm

[00:49:55.570 --> 00:49:59.370]
sure he's long since dead so I can talk about it on the air but anyway every few

[00:49:59.370 --> 00:50:03.350]
years when I was a kid he would show up at the house and he was you know kind of

[00:50:03.350 --> 00:50:09.370]
a Yehu kind of guy and I never I never like kind of a red Nikki kind of guy red

[00:50:09.370 --> 00:50:13.550]
he had red here so that's why they called him red be helpful got it red got it

[00:50:13.550 --> 00:50:17.610]
and anyway the only there's only one thing I remember about him besides the

[00:50:17.610 --> 00:50:20.590]
fact that he looked really a smarmy and like he hadn't bathed in a very long

[00:50:20.590 --> 00:50:25.710]
time and probably hadn't is that he didn't I guess he wasn't really used to

[00:50:25.710 --> 00:50:30.490]
flush toilets all that much okay because every time he would use the commode

[00:50:30.490 --> 00:50:35.170]
ahead of you you go in there would be a surprise waiting for you in the bowl

[00:50:35.170 --> 00:50:39.630]
every not not once in a while every time so maybe he didn't know what that little

[00:50:39.630 --> 00:50:44.910]
handle was there on the side you know maybe just couldn't handle it at least he

[00:50:44.910 --> 00:50:49.110]
was consistent I'll say that for him you always left you a big surprise oh geez

[00:50:49.110 --> 00:50:53.510]
yeah I mean it's not it's not pleasant looking at your own is not a really

[00:50:53.510 --> 00:50:56.370]
pretty sight but have it to go in here and look at somebody else's waiting for

[00:50:56.370 --> 00:51:01.530]
you like oh man one good thing though I guess for my health standpoint it

[00:51:02.070 --> 00:51:07.030]
wasn't red oh anyway a little more on Jim Nogel because you've got so much

[00:51:07.030 --> 00:51:10.950]

Tuesday he questioned whether Broward successful gay vacationers might

[00:54:23.410 --> 00:54:26.730]
discourage others from visiting it could be that if we had a different marketing

[00:54:26.730 --> 00:54:29.810]
strategy we might have 12 million people rather than 10 million because we'd

[00:54:29.810 --> 00:54:33.230]
have more families who knows the outcomes of decisions like that right

a girlfriend that though it's all these people very confused William Dean

[00:56:31.250 --> 00:56:34.950]
Rester we people the urge jurors yesterday to quit him of sexually assaulting a

[00:56:34.950 --> 00:56:40.110]
15 year old boy at the church on Easter 2005 saying his truthful testimony in

[00:56:40.110 --> 00:56:46.410]
Jesus forgiveness and freedom under God's law now I've been trying to figure out

[00:56:46.410 --> 00:56:49.770]
where to held this is in Cleaver and I don't know where that is do you know

[00:56:49.770 --> 00:56:55.210]
where that is Cleaver does like maybe Texas for somewhere like that Johnson

[00:56:55.210 --> 00:56:59.330]
County prosecutor Martin Strahan counter that the man's law dictates that

[00:56:59.330 --> 00:57:02.970]
rest of the imprisoned for as long as legally allowable to protect other children

[00:57:02.970 --> 00:57:08.970]
from an evil wolf and sheep scolding who praise I'm trusting church people while

[00:57:08.970 --> 00:57:15.730]
I find it hard to believe you want to know why that's exactly correct man's law

[00:57:15.730 --> 00:57:19.230]
one twice yesterday despite dramatic closing arguments by a rest of a 20 year old

[00:57:19.230 --> 00:57:23.330]
Cleaver man who defended himself against the four-comendent in 413th state

[00:57:23.330 --> 00:57:26.890]

[00:57:26.890 --> 00:57:30.490]
convict rest of all four counts to a sexual assault and two of indecency with

[00:57:30.490 --> 00:57:34.530]
a child the crimes are secondary felonies jurors later took 50 minutes to

[00:57:34.530 --> 00:57:38.390]
recommend that rest of the maximum prison term of 99 years and pay 10 grand

[00:57:38.390 --> 00:57:42.350]
and fines of stock by prosecutors on each of the four convictions the punishment

[00:57:42.350 --> 00:57:46.030]
exceeds the range for secondary felonies but because rest of his criminal record

[00:57:46.030 --> 00:57:49.170]
includes two convictions for secondary felonies committed as a juvenile

[00:57:49.170 --> 00:57:52.290]
prosecutors were able to seek punishment usually reserved for first-degree

[00:57:52.290 --> 00:57:58.150]
felonies judge William Bosworth I wonder if he's kind of Tom Bosley judge William

[00:58:20.430 --> 00:58:22.890]
represent yourself since you don't know what you can and can't say on the

[01:10:17.810 --> 01:10:22.890]
crazy you are probably the more likely you got a bunch of guns but you can't say

[01:10:22.890 --> 01:10:27.630]
that because America just loves guns more endowed rights to column in the New

[01:10:27.630 --> 01:10:30.690]

and we can't even communicate yeah it's like that only worse because it just

[01:11:21.490 --> 01:11:27.010]
cuts out for like you know a whole word anyway marine dad says brothers and

[01:11:27.010 --> 01:11:30.710]
sisters that's the name of a column in yesterday's New York Times he says W

[01:11:30.710 --> 01:11:33.670]
is Odyssey is one of the audacity in history a black sheep who left above the

[01:11:33.670 --> 01:11:38.010]
expectations and crashed back down it must be a crushing burden for president

[01:11:38.010 --> 01:11:41.190]
Bush who have brought the opposite of what he intended in so many profound ways

[01:11:41.650 --> 01:11:46.130]
for me one of the most amazing reversals brought about by W's reign of error is

[01:11:46.130 --> 01:11:50.590]
this he may have turned my sister into a Democrat as a girl Peggy Shivered in

[01:11:50.590 --> 01:11:53.790]
the bitter culture a cultist John Kennedy's inaugural speech and when she saw

[01:11:53.790 --> 01:11:57.630]
Deputy D. Bohn and Richards and they Texas debated on before she thought this guy

[01:11:57.630 --> 01:12:00.930]
will be the greatest president since JFK he's so good looking bright he's got

[01:12:00.930 --> 01:12:05.390]
everything going for him she volunteered in the Republican invention in 2000

[01:12:05.390 --> 01:12:09.170]
totalling a W stands for women's side I stuck into her into the press

[01:12:09.170 --> 01:12:12.050]
planet breakfast with George and Laura and had a tackler when to the

[01:12:12.050 --> 01:12:16.070]
Constanation report she began cheering as if at a redskins game she flew to

[01:12:16.070 --> 01:12:19.610]
vice Virginia to work a phone bank for W she set up all election night in vain

[01:12:19.610 --> 01:12:23.170]
she cut back on Christmas presents to give him money and probably displayed

[01:12:23.170 --> 01:12:26.750]
pictures of herself at fundraisers one with W one with Dick Cheney she cancelled

[01:12:26.750 --> 01:12:29.830]
her time subscription when I wrote about the rigged buildup to the Iraq war and

[01:12:29.830 --> 01:12:34.430]
called Bush world my chronicle of W's war preality that silly book she wants

[01:12:34.430 --> 01:12:37.490]
told her to be part of that she couldn't totally choose W over me because she

[01:12:37.490 --> 01:12:41.430]
knew if she were dying he wouldn't come and hold my hand on a marine will so

[01:12:41.430 --> 01:12:44.610]
imagine my surprise when she started talking about voting for Barack Obama or

[01:12:44.610 --> 01:12:48.850]
John Edwards if they stopped pussy-footing around Hillary W is loyalty to

[01:12:48.850 --> 01:12:52.710]
Cheney as her dispresence she says sadly when Cheney picked himself as

[01:12:52.710 --> 01:12:56.330]
vice president W should have said bug off he could have made his own bank

[01:12:56.330 --> 01:12:59.370]
when instead of choosing leftovers if only he had bowed his father listened

[01:12:59.370 --> 01:13:03.010]
to Paul and said a Cheney rumsold on Iraq not only is W brought himself down

[01:13:03.010 --> 01:13:06.050]
he's brought down John McCain who I wanted to support but can't because of the

[01:13:06.050 --> 01:13:09.810]
war I grew up in the shadow of water reading was used to seeing service men

[01:13:09.810 --> 01:13:12.810]
without limbs but recently after watching a special on soldiers coming home

[01:13:12.810 --> 01:13:16.010]
for a rack with brain injuries I picked up a picture of my four nephews and I

[01:13:16.010 --> 01:13:19.370]
know how I'd feel if they had fought in Iraq and came home without limbs or in

[01:13:19.370 --> 01:13:23.350]
body bags we're spending billions on this war yet veterans and their children

[01:13:23.350 --> 01:13:26.370]
are practically getting nothing I'm no longer Republicans you said I'm an

[01:13:26.370 --> 01:13:29.430]
American I'll cast my vote for the person I believe will start the process to

[01:13:29.430 --> 01:13:33.950]
get out of Iraq unless of course it's Hillary I knew my family's cocky red

[01:13:33.950 --> 01:13:37.010]
state of mind had changed one of my orally-esque brothers used a mocking

[01:13:37.010 --> 01:13:41.470]
nickname for W and expressed disgust about Iraq another Kevin praises W on

[01:13:41.470 --> 01:13:44.770]
the economy but not an immigration noting that our father who came from Ireland

[01:13:44.770 --> 01:13:49.870]
in steerage at 19 had a fight in W W wonder when citizenship the secret key to

[01:13:49.870 --> 01:13:54.190]
the puzzle is the word illegal he says he supports W on Iraq but argues that

[01:13:54.190 --> 01:13:57.330]
but agrees that one of the president's greatest assets loyalty is turned into

[01:13:57.330 --> 01:14:01.170]
his Achilles heel when I started my sales career and older rep advised me stay

[01:14:01.170 --> 01:14:04.230]
away from the mean drinkers in the bar they start to fight but someone else

[01:14:04.230 --> 01:14:07.370]
always gets hit George Bush is getting hit because he won't move away from

[01:14:07.370 --> 01:14:11.270]
mean drinkers he said the word neocon bother me because I have a diversion

[01:14:11.270 --> 01:14:15.070]
of solitary continues an uncomfortable visual of chainy wolf wits and rum

[01:14:15.070 --> 01:14:18.710]
spelled manning the situation room in a scene reminiscent of Dr. Strangelove and

[01:14:18.710 --> 01:14:24.050]
general Buck turgid- turgid son no more than 10 to 20 million killed tops

[01:14:24.050 --> 01:14:27.930]
so depending on their breaks began to haunt me how could we have underestimated

[01:14:27.930 --> 01:14:31.430]
the post-war situation Iraq so badly as our intelligence that bad or do

[01:14:31.430 --> 01:14:35.230]
the people make decisions even care the Republicans got exactly what they

[01:14:35.230 --> 01:14:38.250]
deserve in last election he said they fell on the same sword they had brilliantly

[01:14:38.250 --> 01:14:41.330]
wielded the game power Tom delay was his corrupt as Jim right to any

[01:14:41.330 --> 01:14:45.850]
hand to his anept as Tom Foley even as the moral I state Kevin Warns Democrats

[01:14:45.850 --> 01:14:49.550]
memoed an anti-inherry a default blind date to the promise not the basis for

[01:14:49.550 --> 01:14:53.710]
long-term relationship my sister still has a picture of W up but chainy is

[01:14:53.710 --> 01:14:56.390]
face down in the laundry room

[01:14:58.470 --> 01:15:05.630]
hello very good morning you watching beta series 24 a summer of news we'll begin

[01:15:05.630 --> 01:15:08.990]
by translating the rhetoric of the latest speech from President Bush I believe

[01:15:08.990 --> 01:15:13.330]
we can succeed in Iraq and I know we must translation my ego won't allow me to

[01:15:13.330 --> 01:15:17.330]
admit failure so I'm running out the clock until 2009 or impeachment so

[01:15:17.330 --> 01:15:21.130]
goal shared by the Iraqis and our coalition partners a decent number of

[01:15:21.130 --> 01:15:26.110]
mostly living Iraqis agree as well as 34 soldiers from Estonia I like to

[01:15:26.110 --> 01:15:29.630]
fish on this sentence he could be speaking literally but we believe this is

[01:15:29.630 --> 01:15:34.430]
either secret code to his evangelical base or another failed reference 9-11

[01:15:34.430 --> 01:15:38.590]
all these extremist groups would be involved in by precipitous American withdrawal

[01:15:38.590 --> 01:15:43.230]
which would confuse and frighten friends and allies in the region meaning that

[01:15:43.230 --> 01:15:47.050]
the American army just up and left without telling anyone the 34 soldiers from

[01:15:47.050 --> 01:15:49.330]
Estonia would be confused and alone

[01:15:49.330 --> 01:15:51.970]
bases throughout the Middle East have a stake in stable Iraq

[01:15:51.970 --> 01:15:55.690]
translation like any good mafia so dick cheney has given Middle Eastern

[01:15:55.690 --> 01:15:59.890]
countries a small cut of the action as we remove our oil from underneath their

[01:15:59.890 --> 01:16:03.850]
sand I look forward to picking back nose actually right there he's just being

[01:16:03.850 --> 01:16:05.210]
literal thank you very much

[01:16:05.210 --> 01:16:09.430]

[01:16:18.810 --> 01:16:22.550]

cents an hour like you are Chris I wish I was making that much that was like a

[01:17:11.750 --> 01:17:15.670]
little shot okay let me just take a puket what we got here who's your favorite

[01:17:15.670 --> 01:17:19.110]
Florida born to entertain it of all time how many vote we got six fifty

the hell out of it and I wanted to are the aren't you not what is it what Jim

Morrison 151 and Tom Petty 131 to 20 vote apart we got a pretty good race

[01:17:35.290 --> 01:17:38.630]
there I would say I mean there's no contest I mean Tom Petty couldn't lick

[01:17:38.630 --> 01:17:43.830]
Jim Morrison's ass although probably now would wouldn't who would want to

[01:17:43.830 --> 01:17:52.710]
anyway right no even if he were still alive 151 to 131 Sydney Poytty's got 80 are

[01:17:52.710 --> 01:17:59.750]
you eating is that what you know it oh for a great sake I'm clicking on

that open now thing and I'm talking to you nothing I'll talk to my mouth for

[01:18:02.830 --> 01:18:06.710]
it's always worked in the past Chris what could the problem possibly be I think

[01:18:06.710 --> 01:18:10.770]
they're overloading it I think it's just you well if you're overloading and how

[01:18:10.770 --> 01:18:16.030]
come he can get on there I'll tell you I think you did someone there's one wrong

[01:18:16.030 --> 01:18:18.870]
I click on where it says in the arrived you're showing my every face comes up

[01:18:18.870 --> 01:18:22.690]
there with that stupid bio and a whole deal but if I click on that open now it's

[01:18:22.690 --> 01:18:26.970]
is and I nothing happens maybe they're blocking Canadian user and eat yeah

[01:18:26.970 --> 01:18:29.650]
maybe Canadian users are getting blood must be it not

[01:18:31.430 --> 01:18:37.270]
fate anyways got 36 Wesley stifes 29 Ronnie van Zant 27 Gerald Ham and 26 Luther

[01:18:37.270 --> 01:18:43.670]
Campbell 25 and nobody else has got even 20 so strictly a two-house race so I

[01:18:43.670 --> 01:18:45.910]
guess we're gonna have to leave it up to Chris because he's the only one who can

[01:18:45.910 --> 01:18:52.050]
get on at damn thing am I right about that sure okay we'll leave it in your

[01:18:52.050 --> 01:18:56.190]
capable hands okay when we get to noon keep keep your eye peeled on that

[01:18:56.190 --> 01:19:02.030]
and see how fast those certificates go for Joseph will do well I'm a little

[01:19:02.030 --> 01:19:04.830]
nervous about leaving something that important up to you but I'm sure you can

[01:19:04.830 --> 01:19:09.530]
handle it okay I can handle it put a lot of pressure Oscar the cat now what is

[01:19:09.530 --> 01:19:12.810]
it why are you playing that just I'm later yeah I know who it is nobody

[01:19:13.350 --> 01:19:18.430]
I don't want to hear it's on Oscar the cat seems to have an uncanny

[01:19:18.430 --> 01:19:21.450]
knack for predicting when nursing home patients are going to die by

[01:19:21.450 --> 01:19:25.030]
curling up next to them during their final hours his accuracy observed in

[01:19:25.030 --> 01:19:29.310]
25 cases as let the staff to call family members once he has chosen someone it

[01:19:29.310 --> 01:19:34.450]
usually means they have less than four hours to live oh my god don't let this

[01:19:34.450 --> 01:19:38.310]
cat curl up next to you or you're a dead man you'll be singing on time over here

[01:19:38.310 --> 01:19:42.310]
he does make too many mistakes he seems to understand when patients are about

[01:19:42.310 --> 01:19:46.650]
to die so Dr. David Dosa in the interview he describes a phenomenon in a

[01:19:46.650 --> 01:19:50.710]
poignant essay in today's issue of the New England Urinal of Medicine many

[01:19:50.710 --> 01:19:53.190]
family members take some solace from it he said they appreciate the

[01:19:53.190 --> 01:19:56.610]
companionship that the cat provides for their dying loved one said Dosa a

[01:19:56.610 --> 01:20:00.570]
geriatrician and assistant professor medicine at Brown University the two

[01:20:00.570 --> 01:20:03.890]
year old feline was adopted as a kitten grew up in a third floor dementia unit

[01:20:03.890 --> 01:20:07.610]
at the Steer House nursing and rehabilitation center how do you like that in a

[01:20:07.610 --> 01:20:12.330]
third floor dementia unit the facility treats people with Alzheimer's

[01:20:12.330 --> 01:20:15.710]
Parkinson's other illnesses after about six months the staff noticed that Oscar

[01:20:15.710 --> 01:20:19.110]
would make his own rounds just like the doctors and nurses he'd sniff and

[01:20:19.110 --> 01:20:22.630]
observe patients and then sit beside people who wind up dying in just a few

[01:20:22.630 --> 01:20:28.850]
hours if the kitty cat comes to visit your ass you're gonna be dead soon dose

[01:20:28.850 --> 01:20:32.590]
to said Oscar seems to take his work seriously is generally a loof this is not a

[01:20:32.590 --> 01:20:36.410]
cat that's friendly to people he said I wonder if there's like maybe a

[01:20:36.410 --> 01:20:39.490]
connection to dying because the cat comes to visit them you think maybe as

[01:20:39.490 --> 01:20:41.210]
opposed to him being so like psychic and crap

[01:20:48.210 --> 01:20:52.670]
he wears such a clown Oscar is better predicting death than the people who

[01:20:52.670 --> 01:20:56.010]
work there said Dr. Joan Tenno a Brown University who treats patients at the

[01:20:56.010 --> 01:21:00.370]
nursing home as an expert on care for the terminal ill she was convinced of

[01:21:00.370 --> 01:21:04.430]
Oscar's talent when he made his 13th correct call while observing one patient

[01:21:04.430 --> 01:21:07.370]
Tenno said she noticed the woman wasn't eating was breathing with difficulty

[01:21:07.370 --> 01:21:12.090]
and their legs had a bluish tinge signs that often mean that death is near a

[01:21:12.090 --> 01:21:16.010]
bluish tinge that might like to start a good sign I have bloomed in their legs and

[01:21:16.010 --> 01:21:20.310]
bluish stock then what can I do Oscar wouldn't stay in South of the room most

[01:21:20.310 --> 01:21:24.110]
so Tenno thought his streak was broken instead it turned out that doctor's

[01:21:24.110 --> 01:21:27.090]
prediction was roughly 10 hours to early sure enough during the patient's

[01:21:27.090 --> 01:21:31.250]
final two hours nurses told Tenno that Oscar joined the woman at her bedside

[01:21:31.710 --> 01:21:36.010]
just before she croaked doctor say most of the people get a visit from the

[01:21:36.010 --> 01:21:39.630]
sweet face gray and white cat are so early probably don't know he's there so

[01:21:39.630 --> 01:21:44.630]
patients are not worth it is a harbinger of death most families are grateful for

[01:21:44.630 --> 01:21:47.130]
the advanced warning though one wanted us to run out of the room while the

[01:21:47.130 --> 01:21:50.910]
family member died while Oscar is put outside he paces in me houses this

[01:21:50.910 --> 01:21:55.290]
pleasure no one is certain of Oscar's behavior scientifically significant or

[01:21:55.290 --> 01:21:58.910]
points to a cause Tenno wonders if the can notices tell-tale sense of the

[01:22:00.230 --> 01:22:04.550]
behavior of the nurses who raised him Nicholas Dobbin who directs an animal

[01:22:04.550 --> 01:22:07.870]
behavior clinic at Tufts University coming school of veterinary medicine and

[01:22:07.870 --> 01:22:10.810]
has read those his article said the only way to know is to carefully document

[01:22:10.810 --> 01:22:14.430]
how Oscar divides this time between the living and the dying the living in

[01:22:14.430 --> 01:22:18.610]
those who are yelling I'm dying over here if Oscar really is a fully a furry

[01:22:18.610 --> 01:22:21.790]
grim reaper all under these kind of the grim reaper Robert creeper the grim

[01:22:21.790 --> 01:22:26.890]
reaper the board sure if I still really is a furry grim reaper now you say

[01:22:26.890 --> 01:22:31.750]
that because George is eating or what no right here no both of them it's also

[01:22:31.750 --> 01:22:35.030]
possible to be able to be given myself senator pleasures like a heated blanket

[01:22:35.030 --> 01:22:38.550]
placed on a dying person don't mention nursing home staffers are concerned

[01:22:38.550 --> 01:22:41.830]
but explaining Oscar so long as he gives families a better chance of saying goodbye

[01:22:41.830 --> 01:22:45.950]
to the dying Oscar recently received a wall plaque publicly committing his

[01:22:45.950 --> 01:22:52.170]
compassionate hospice care he got a wall plaque the cat that's America for

[01:22:52.170 --> 01:22:56.290]

And that's a plus for today. I'm going to know where Churchill said he ain't going to go away easy

[01:32:30.090 --> 01:32:35.650]
If Churchill wins the lawsuit Lane said the school can end up by paying Churchill's legal fees and they have to reinstate him

[01:32:35.650 --> 01:32:40.490]
Today's message is there'll be payback for free speech lane added the board said an academic misconduct

[01:32:40.490 --> 01:32:45.930]
As is reason for firing Churchill Churchill support is met him with t-shirt signs and drums following the board's decision

[01:32:46.730 --> 01:32:52.510]
Lane said he and his client are now on the offense Churchill received one of your salary as a tenured professor following his dismissal

[01:32:52.510 --> 01:32:55.270]
See what officials said how many we got left Chris 15

[01:32:57.550 --> 01:33:00.390]
Well, what are you talking about the thing is going back up again now?

[01:33:00.510 --> 01:33:07.230]
Yeah, well the stuff said that if their credit card is declined then he went back into the queue and you're cutting out real bad again now

[01:33:07.710 --> 01:33:13.370]
So you got 15 of those left there hundred dollars gives you to get certificates for 50 bucks for Josephson water

[01:33:13.790 --> 01:33:17.810]
15 of them left. That's not a good sign. Although it's only trouble wait exactly

[01:33:18.930 --> 01:33:23.510]
Just calm down take your time and I only wish I could see it the count because you could you could be making it up

[01:33:23.510 --> 01:33:24.830]
You could say oh, we got all 50 left

[01:33:25.330 --> 01:33:27.710]
Why would I do that just to be an ass?

[01:33:28.390 --> 01:33:28.830]
nah

[01:33:29.890 --> 01:33:30.330]
white

[01:33:31.110 --> 01:33:37.050]
Well, representative Mark Udell supported the board's decision to fire Churchill in a release statement academic freedom goes hand in hand with freedom of speech

[01:33:37.050 --> 01:33:41.610]
Even the most controversial unpopular views will inevitably find a safe haven in our colleges and universities

[01:33:41.610 --> 01:33:46.130]
That doesn't mean all ideas are equal and for sure that inflammatory ideas are beyond reproach

[01:33:46.130 --> 01:33:50.190]
Nerd is excused teachers of professors for ordering nonsense and calling an instruction

[01:33:51.210 --> 01:33:55.650]
He added that Churchill's actions went far beyond giving voice to represent reprehensible points of view

[01:33:55.650 --> 01:33:57.950]
And that is dismissal was about a academic conduct

[01:33:59.430 --> 01:34:05.390]
Within minutes of an 8 a.m. Meeting Tuesday the CEO board of Regents decided to go to executive session to discuss whether the fire Churchill

[01:34:05.390 --> 01:34:07.830]
Churchill and Lane argued their case before the board

[01:34:07.830 --> 01:34:12.410]
But they said they wanted to do it publicly, but the board voted to go into executive session behind closed doors to hear the case

[01:34:15.450 --> 01:34:18.350]
But a beep bit of boot put about what there's no such thing as freedom of speech anymore

[01:34:18.350 --> 01:34:22.590]
We know that so what else is this guy thinking about freedom of speech my ass. That's ancient history in America

[01:34:23.630 --> 01:34:28.690]
Maybe in Canada we got freedom of speech or like in needle-ons places like that where

[01:34:29.390 --> 01:34:31.670]
Maybe in Denmark Sweden

[01:34:32.450 --> 01:34:32.850]
Norway

[01:34:34.130 --> 01:34:38.610]
Finland places like that maybe they have a certain amount of freedom of speech not in America no more. It's in the past

[01:34:39.050 --> 01:34:39.870]
It's in the rear

[01:34:40.390 --> 01:34:42.950]
Just look in your rear view mirror and you'll see freedom all over the place

[01:34:44.050 --> 01:34:47.750]
695 votes. We're gonna make 700 easy. Now what was our goal 8 million? I don't care what it was

[01:34:48.510 --> 01:34:51.350]
I'm just ticked off that I still can't see that thing are we still at 15?

[01:34:52.270 --> 01:34:57.830]
Yes, you know what I'm thinking I'm thinking about other people. Oh, we're at 14 a lot of other people can't get on this thing either

[01:34:59.830 --> 01:35:06.610]
I have no problem with it so well you have no problem. Okay. I'm having a problem and the fact that this is kind of dragging a little bit

[01:35:06.610 --> 01:35:08.410]
I mean that that's not a good sign

[01:35:10.050 --> 01:35:13.510]
I think people are having a problem. They're clicking on it. I'll find out what's over the website

[01:35:14.690 --> 01:35:17.990]
Yeah, this is Josh Curtis's website. I think maybe a little bit too much hanky

[01:35:17.990 --> 01:35:21.990]
Thank you with a Russian girlfriend after you took to Vegas after you came back and make sure that George

[01:35:22.470 --> 01:35:24.010]
Didn't the pochki around with the goods

[01:35:25.750 --> 01:35:26.870]
Yeah, oh for me

[01:35:27.990 --> 01:35:35.290]
Yeah, and of course he's probably out to lunch now. I like every mom. He got fed. We made it worth his while. Oh, did he to have a good time in Vegas and look the other way

[01:35:41.390 --> 01:35:46.210]
699 on the floor. We got 700 likes. I think I said 800 that was shooting way too high and if Chris had any brains

[01:35:46.210 --> 01:35:49.490]
It would have been thinking but he wasn't paying any attention. He was eating the free food. Did not sell it?

[01:35:50.450 --> 01:35:53.910]
What did not sell it 700 you must have cut out. What do we got now?

[01:35:55.030 --> 01:36:00.130]
699 no, I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about so you're gonna all your numbers messed up. That's the problem. 14

[01:36:00.750 --> 01:36:01.070]
14

[01:36:02.370 --> 01:36:03.930]
Just a number day today. What can I say?

[01:36:05.390 --> 01:36:06.830]
14 that's not very many votes

[01:36:07.670 --> 01:36:10.870]
How much of I clicked that view current again. It's gonna go over 700. Let me see

[01:36:11.310 --> 01:36:16.030]
Okay, I said 699 not too good. Okay, I'm gonna with dispense with playing a bit right now

[01:36:16.030 --> 01:36:19.670]
So I can straighten this thing out for you. We got an young left and the reason I was able to get on there

[01:36:21.410 --> 01:36:27.330]
Yeah, yeah, you with me. There's a problem with the link. There's a problem with the link the link it's stink

[01:36:27.330 --> 01:36:30.970]
And you know, which way were you clicking on the one underneath the my picture?

[01:36:31.190 --> 01:36:32.930]
And I hope I'm gonna sign a bigger burn

[01:36:33.470 --> 01:36:39.030]
Well, that's one that I used to get to it and there was a problem with it. Okay, Mr. Hot shot, Mr. Faso

[01:36:39.030 --> 01:36:45.530]
That one I'm clicking and now let's see this is anything no, but if you click the near Roger show and you go down on the right hand side

[01:36:47.390 --> 01:36:50.030]
And just not all that far down on the right hand side

[01:36:50.030 --> 01:36:56.190]
There's another thing and it works fine QA and half price deals and there's Joseph's on the yada yada and there's six six left

[01:36:56.190 --> 01:37:01.930]
Well, I got a idea on that's what I just clicked and I checked on two other computers during the break and all those were connecting fine

[01:37:01.930 --> 01:37:06.290]
So I'm just telling you right now, Mr. Hot shot. See why would I make it up?

[01:37:06.390 --> 01:37:12.450]
Have it I've been telling you since the quarter of that the thing doesn't work. Haven't I been telling you that yes?

[01:37:13.350 --> 01:37:20.110]
We know what's working fine. Yeah, well great. I'm glad it works for you. You're in the building great

[01:37:21.190 --> 01:37:26.290]
Six times this time. Yeah, I'm two hundred miles away and it doesn't work nished from here. Okay, not for me

[01:37:26.290 --> 01:37:29.610]
The building would have nothing to do with it. Let me try it again. Well, whatever

[01:37:30.730 --> 01:37:34.630]
Being on the same server whatever the deal is I haven't got the fogiest clue

[01:37:34.630 --> 01:37:38.530]
I just tried it again. No way no dice. I'm clicking that other one there

[01:37:38.530 --> 01:37:43.190]
Why if you click my picture there if you can handle it and go to that page and on the right hand column

[01:37:43.190 --> 01:37:48.910]
You'll see the thing there. Neils have price deals with green and blue and orange and all of this stuff all of these

[01:37:48.910 --> 01:37:51.370]
You know how that goes all of these things that's right and

[01:37:52.650 --> 01:37:55.270]
There's the thing there's the page and says six there's six left

[01:37:56.470 --> 01:38:02.110]
And I guarantee you there wouldn't be any left if we you know if this thing was working for everybody would but I'll take your work for now

[01:38:02.110 --> 01:38:03.090]
There's nine see

[01:38:03.930 --> 01:38:07.830]
Because they check them out we find out there's a bunch of deadbeats out there like Bokobrine, you know

[01:38:09.250 --> 01:38:10.510]
Bokobrine and now there's nine

[01:38:12.730 --> 01:38:18.370]
Yeah, yeah, I think he's probably got his finger in it would be the first place. He's had that finger back home Robert

[01:38:18.890 --> 01:38:24.350]
That's Robert creepier the grim reepier the Lord of the board on a station. It's badly hoarded

[01:38:24.970 --> 01:38:27.950]
Oh, it's gonna be so good winter row starts now what day's that gonna be tomorrow?

[01:38:29.490 --> 01:38:33.530]
Okay, are you still eating or what no between feeding right now waiting for to

[01:38:34.570 --> 01:38:42.450]
You're between feedings. Yeah, they just keep bringing it. It's it's insane really and I can't stop eating it because it's good so

[01:38:43.550 --> 01:38:48.670]
And the price is right you know it and the price is right on these certificates too if we can get rid of these last nine

[01:38:52.290 --> 01:38:52.650]
I

[01:38:52.650 --> 01:38:56.890]
Don't like to drag this thing out especially when I'm leaving at one o'clock wouldn't be bad if I dragged it all the way up

[01:38:56.890 --> 01:38:58.590]
One o'clock. Oh, it'll give me something to talk about

[01:38:59.590 --> 01:39:02.950]
Well, what do you mean by that? Are you suggesting I don't know how to talk about one one how to that?

[01:39:03.030 --> 01:39:08.230]
What they would yeah, that's what I'm suggesting what day was that show that it will give me something to talk about

[01:39:08.230 --> 01:39:09.170]
I'm talking about

[01:39:09.170 --> 01:39:14.550]
You're not everything everybody says all the time. I'll speed your senility now as opposed to playing that got off a music

[01:39:14.550 --> 01:39:17.510]
You like to just devastate the audience with right?

[01:39:21.110 --> 01:39:21.510]
I

[01:39:21.510 --> 01:39:27.410]
Well, I keep refreshing this thing and it I think moving you know, I got the page though. That's a good news still about nine

[01:39:28.490 --> 01:39:29.090]
I'm off

[01:39:30.070 --> 01:39:33.090]
Well, it's dog days, you know, it's July 26th your fault

[01:39:33.550 --> 01:39:39.050]
Hey, it must be my fault must because I'm on now George was on they've been gone in two shakes of lambs to whatever that means

[01:39:39.050 --> 01:39:43.790]
Isn't that right they say that more states are bucking the national crackdown on sex offenders

[01:39:43.790 --> 01:39:48.690]
That's bucking by pairing back punishment for teenagers who have consensual sex with underage partners

[01:39:49.990 --> 01:39:52.390]
Governors in seven states have signed bills the past two months

[01:39:52.390 --> 01:39:57.710]
It means no prosecution for some teens or no requirement to register as a sex offender states very widely

[01:39:57.710 --> 01:40:04.270]
How they prosecute consensual teen sex which prosecuted referred to as Romeo and Juliet cases Romeo and Julietta

[01:40:04.910 --> 01:40:08.490]
But some remain tough on teens are several years older than their partners illegal

[01:40:08.490 --> 01:40:10.990]
I'd you consent varies from 14 to 18 depending on the state

[01:40:12.610 --> 01:40:17.310]
The issue is through debate recently through the Georgia case of Gianarlo Wilson 21 boy

[01:40:17.310 --> 01:40:23.150]
We heard a lot about that he's serving a 10-year sentence for receiving all sex from a 15-year-old girl at a New Year's party

[01:40:23.150 --> 01:40:28.470]
He was 17 she was 15 and they threw him in a slamer for 10 years only in America baby

[01:40:29.030 --> 01:40:31.510]
The only thing worse he could add was maybe like a pin joint

[01:40:32.050 --> 01:40:38.250]
Then he got like life he got an electric chair the Georgia Supreme Court heard arguments Friday whether to release some last Friday

[01:40:38.870 --> 01:40:42.790]
Officials in some states say tough law should be changed as Georgia to last year to focus on

[01:40:42.790 --> 01:40:48.030]
Predator is not irresponsible teenagers. I was that interesting irresponsible. How about horny teenagers?

[01:40:49.410 --> 01:40:55.210]
Is that redundant? I have imagined they say those teens need to be punished for labeling them as sex offenders on public

[01:40:55.210 --> 01:40:59.990]
Registries may do more harm than good. Let's capture the truly 10% of our predators at Allison Taylor

[01:40:59.990 --> 01:41:04.510]
Executive director the Texas Council on sex offender treatment and independent governor appointed board

[01:41:05.090 --> 01:41:09.930]
She says June all offenders are less likely than adults to commit another sex crime and more receptive to treatment

[01:41:10.650 --> 01:41:16.690]
This month Texas revamped how it classifies sex offenders Taylor says some teens were getting lower risk rating and not have to register

[01:41:17.850 --> 01:41:23.790]
The changes in some states including Oklahoma mirror a federal law that states must implement by 2009

[01:41:23.790 --> 01:41:30.530]
The Adam Walsh act outlines who must register but exempts teens convicted of consensual sex if the age difference is no more than four years

[01:41:30.530 --> 01:41:35.770]
And the younger one is at least 13 states can be stricter. So in other words if the chick is 14 and the guy is like 19

[01:41:36.210 --> 01:41:42.810]
No good the age difference has to be no more than four years got it got it if she's like 16 and he's 20

[01:41:42.810 --> 01:41:46.790]
He's going to the slamer. No no more than four years. How about if he's 20 and a half?

[01:41:49.910 --> 01:41:56.010]
Okay, see what I'm saying I understand stupid Arizona will end the registration for some why not to young

[01:41:57.930 --> 01:42:01.930]
Eight eight you're suggesting eight for consensual sex. No, I'm suggesting eight

[01:42:01.930 --> 01:42:02.370]
eight

[01:42:03.870 --> 01:42:07.690]
That's what I got I just I double check nothing. I'll believe you about a double-check you don't believe me

[01:42:07.690 --> 01:42:12.210]
I don't why do you just know jump about could to I know that that's what that's what that's called us told me

[01:42:13.210 --> 01:42:17.630]
Arizona will end registration for some convicted teens or not will not require registration of the sex partners

[01:42:17.630 --> 01:42:24.990]
And no more than five years apart age in Florida teens may potentially keep their names off the registry if the age gap is within four years

[01:42:24.990 --> 01:42:27.070]
It depends on how big the gap is

[01:42:29.090 --> 01:42:35.970]
Other state limits limit when they will prosecute Indiana will not prosecute teens if they're in a dating relationship and the age gap is four years or less

[01:42:35.970 --> 01:42:39.350]
Connecticut will not prosecute the age gap is three years or less up from two years

[01:42:40.990 --> 01:42:41.390]
I

[01:42:41.390 --> 01:42:43.210]
mean you really think if it's anybody's business

[01:42:46.930 --> 01:42:53.290]
No, they're like he's like 19 and she's a 16 or 15. Why is anybody's business? Oh, cuz that's the law

[01:42:53.290 --> 01:42:59.810]
It's the law. I see maybe I'll have to play that all I want to play read a book again before I leave two three more times

[01:43:00.790 --> 01:43:07.230]
As many states passed up a laws on sex offenders that include law minimum sentences like time electronic modern ring even the death penalty some law

[01:43:07.230 --> 01:43:12.430]
Make his a reluctant to ease punishment. It's a sensitive issue says Democratic state senator Don Betzold of Minnesota

[01:43:12.430 --> 01:43:19.190]
He says some lawmakers don't want to be seen as soft on crime others want to overt unintended consequences of the sweeping crack down on sex offenders

[01:43:19.190 --> 01:43:24.910]
He pushed a bill that we remove the sex registry requirement for some kids under 16 it passed the state Senate

[01:43:24.910 --> 01:43:28.150]
But died in the house similar measures failed to pass this year in Maine in New Hampshire

[01:43:28.990 --> 01:43:30.790]
Some law make you say there should be some

[01:43:31.730 --> 01:43:35.310]
Consequences for teens there should be some recognition. This is wrongful behavior

[01:43:35.310 --> 01:43:38.530]
So Connecticut state representative Arthur O'Neill a Republican of course

[01:43:38.530 --> 01:43:44.970]
We have a problem with older boys taking advantage of younger girls. How about if older girls take advantage of younger boys?

[01:43:44.970 --> 01:43:48.490]
How about that? That's good. That's good. That's a good thing right? Right?

[01:43:49.250 --> 01:43:52.930]
Having some of them is always good boys take advantage of younger boys. How about that?

[01:43:53.050 --> 01:43:54.970]
He's not bad. That's bad. Yeah. It was disgusting

[01:43:54.970 --> 01:43:55.490]
Such a

[01:43:55.490 --> 01:44:00.610]
Mercy for the tea room all the water they all right for in Jim Noggle and can I can he walk or are

[01:44:00.610 --> 01:44:02.110]
Staking pick I know you don't listen

[01:44:02.110 --> 01:44:06.970]
I don't but if you could have heard the ass-licking that was going on this morning between them and Jim Noggle

[01:44:06.970 --> 01:44:13.270]
I mean, you know, he's not that Noggle was a crazy person who can he walk or anybody that doesn't know it anybody that

[01:44:13.270 --> 01:44:18.950]
Keeps pretending. Oh, he loves gay people. Bye-bye. Yeah, right. Just like I need a bride love gay people who is same thing same craft

[01:44:19.630 --> 01:44:22.470]
Same bigotry same hate same stereotype same

[01:44:23.430 --> 01:44:24.150]
grotesque generalizations

[01:44:26.350 --> 01:44:27.070]
same hallucinations

[01:44:27.670 --> 01:44:32.170]
But nevertheless they like him on a morning show and you want to know why cuz Vogue camper took too many showers naked with guys

[01:44:32.170 --> 01:44:38.830]
Fortunately and they don't come any worse than Neil Rogers. Hello. This is your next Republican president for a D-tops

[01:44:38.830 --> 01:44:43.650]
I'm here to debunk the mission groomers that I'm dying from terminal cancer

[01:44:43.650 --> 01:44:50.970]
Just forget you heard that. More than or not. I am as infreused as I hear to back me up as my good friend Tony snow

[01:44:50.970 --> 01:44:54.390]
Thanks, Fred having battled cancer myself like

[01:44:54.390 --> 01:45:02.530]
Certainly Fred Thompson was not born under a bad sign. It's a strange brew that you do when you want it to

[01:45:02.530 --> 01:45:06.190]
To confer a last statement I'd prefer to my sister

[01:45:06.190 --> 01:45:09.870]
Let's leave the truth slayer. Hello. Well, we didn't

[01:45:11.550 --> 01:45:16.490]
So you see there's nothing to worry about you can still go ahead for a morning

[01:45:17.370 --> 01:45:19.190]
But you better vote fast

[01:45:19.890 --> 01:45:25.190]
Well, I'm gonna leave the Joseph thing and you're capable hand cuz it's back up to the eye again. You got oh

[01:45:26.650 --> 01:45:31.690]
Not even in the George's capable hand, but you should have no difficulty getting it back down to a right

[01:45:31.690 --> 01:45:32.350]
Give it all go

[01:45:33.630 --> 01:45:38.430]
Either do well, it slows it down when people are going on air with bogus credit cards or whatever

[01:45:38.430 --> 01:45:42.670]
You know bogus people with bogus stories and bogus lives, you know, I mean

[01:45:43.110 --> 01:45:45.010]
No, what do you mean? I don't know

[01:45:45.630 --> 01:45:51.990]
Now house judiciary committee voted to contempt the Congress citations Wednesday against what house chief is to have Josh Bolton president Bush's former legal counselor

[01:45:51.990 --> 01:45:53.730]
Harry admires that the partially

[01:45:54.530 --> 01:46:00.450]
The 22 the 17 party line vote which would sanction the pair for favor to comply with subpoenas on the fairings of several federal prosecutors

[01:46:00.450 --> 01:46:02.950]
Advanced the citation to full house a

[01:46:03.810 --> 01:46:09.070]
Senior Democratic official who spoke on the condition of an anemones said the house itself likely would take up the citations after the Congress's

[01:46:09.070 --> 01:46:14.050]
August recess committee chairman John Conier said the panel had nothing to lose by advancing the citations

[01:46:14.050 --> 01:46:17.070]
Because it wouldn't allow the president to lead to flood Congress authority

[01:46:17.070 --> 01:46:21.370]
Republicans warned that a contempt citation would lose and federal court even forgot that far

[01:46:21.370 --> 01:46:23.730]
But a bit bit of a bit about the heartage and impure tree

[01:46:24.230 --> 01:46:29.550]
Like I said, no freedom of speech no more laws no more anything. It's just they make it up as they go along

[01:46:30.910 --> 01:46:32.070]
That's the Bush F and way

[01:46:32.950 --> 01:46:38.610]
Well, we still got nine. I guess like I said, I'm not you know Chris can keep an eye on it. You got your eye on it? Of course

[01:46:38.610 --> 01:46:43.930]
I got my own this term is so that they just writing. Oh, that sounds really good. It is really good

[01:46:43.930 --> 01:46:47.090]
Well, I just keep some coming from me. It's unreaching how moist

[01:46:47.830 --> 01:46:52.210]
Well, you can rave about it. Well, it's all those are last nine

[01:46:53.250 --> 01:46:59.450]
736 votes on the pool. Who's your favorite Florida born? I beg your pardon eight eight entertainer of all time

[01:47:08.890 --> 01:47:12.010]
Jimmy seems to be pulled away a little bit for a dead guy. He's moving pretty good

[01:47:13.670 --> 01:47:19.590]
Now he died in France am I right about that? Yes, you are. Yeah buried there as far as I know he's buried in France

[01:47:19.590 --> 01:47:21.590]
in a river and

[01:47:21.590 --> 01:47:24.470]
What was the story? I mean couldn't have been drugs drunk?

[01:47:25.230 --> 01:47:28.550]
Bad living and booze and all these things now

[01:47:29.550 --> 01:47:36.150]
Tom Petty 142 he trails by 31 vote. Sydney Proxie is got 91. They call him Mr. Tips even now

[01:47:36.150 --> 01:47:43.550]
You think like if he goes into a supermarket or something they walk up to say, are you Mr. Tips? I bet you get that all the time. I doubt it

[01:47:44.390 --> 01:47:46.390]
Fade on a way 38. She's great

[01:47:47.030 --> 01:47:51.390]
Rodney v. M. 34 Wesley stifes 31. Let's take a look because I don't want to read the whole list here

[01:47:51.390 --> 01:47:54.150]
It would be just absolutely ponderous be unacceptable

[01:47:54.630 --> 01:47:58.110]
Aaron Carter we got 736 votes. Guess how many little errands got?

[01:47:58.110 --> 01:48:00.070]

Anybody over the age of like what anybody? It's not a 12-year-old girl is not part of his out bag 12-year-old girl or an old fat gay man

[01:48:09.170 --> 01:48:14.010]
And a little fag yeah, is that what you said? Yes, was that like a little bit of a shot?

[01:48:14.430 --> 01:48:16.290]
I'm getting shots from all over the place today. It's okay

[01:48:16.650 --> 01:48:20.110]
I would be surprised if Dr. Fred shots comes into guest on your one to two hour

[01:48:20.110 --> 01:48:23.790]
Who is he the guy with the blue lips? Donnie v. Zanska one now

[01:48:28.850 --> 01:48:29.810]
He might be a contender

[01:48:30.830 --> 01:48:32.210]
You think? Well

[01:48:35.710 --> 01:48:37.670]
Esther will she's got seven and

[01:48:39.030 --> 01:48:44.550]
I hear she's moving on up. Well, that's right. It's the wrong show. I could play that theme again just to aggravate you but too much like work

[01:48:45.690 --> 01:48:48.790]
And let me get back to that thing again for Joseph's son of water

[01:48:51.190 --> 01:48:51.510]
Five

[01:48:54.550 --> 01:49:01.810]
You ready for that five? Yeah, okay. Well, I want to leave you with something. I don't want them all to be gone when you sit your ass down and it would be bad

[01:49:03.550 --> 01:49:07.250]
I want you to have a look a little something something to do you know because it'll kill some good time for it

[01:49:07.250 --> 01:49:10.770]
I wanted to I was speaking of that. I'm not gonna read that promo again. You can promote it

[01:49:11.650 --> 01:49:18.590]
Saturday, George five to seven p.m. At the Verizon Marla store at no 25-1 North Federal Highway and he invites all the chronics all the people

[01:49:18.590 --> 01:49:24.730]
How about Woody can come by too Woody if I ask him right? He might if he asked me or might he might

[01:49:25.290 --> 01:49:32.350]
All the crazy people just just stand around hold hands maybe Kenny what's his name will come by Kenny Walker? He's crazy

[01:49:33.250 --> 01:49:36.270]
And who and Ken Ken block he's another one

[01:49:39.730 --> 01:49:42.970]
Yeah, huh you enjoy seeing those people yeah a lot in

[01:49:43.070 --> 01:49:48.710]
In Mondays debate with the benefit of having time to think through her response. This is a Katrina vanden who elimination

[01:49:48.710 --> 01:49:50.390]
Why Obama got it right?

[01:49:51.230 --> 01:49:57.130]
Hillary Clinton poses the foreign policy sophisticated to Barack Obama the bold leader who didn't hesitate to say that he would meet with the leaders of Cuba

[01:49:57.130 --> 01:49:59.250]
Iran North Korea Siri and Ben-Athawala

[01:49:59.710 --> 01:50:04.690]
My colleague David Kornar used that a BAM was committed a major blunder reflecting his life a foreign policy experience

[01:50:04.690 --> 01:50:09.290]
My colleague area Berman posted his smart and sharp counter to David's argument on behalf of those like Hillary Clinton

[01:50:09.290 --> 01:50:15.090]
Who are steeped in the nuances language and minefields of foreign policy but I feel strongly enough to weigh in on this debates his Katrina

[01:50:16.090 --> 01:50:18.530]
Those nuances in minefields can also be trapped

[01:50:18.530 --> 01:50:23.330]
Witness how far Clinton's nuanced experience got her when confronted with the 2002 Iraq war resolution

[01:50:24.070 --> 01:50:27.370]
David may well be right that Obama's opponents will try to exploit his response

[01:50:27.370 --> 01:50:31.390]
But from a foreign policy point of view was Obama's response so wrong and Clinton so right?

[01:50:31.790 --> 01:50:37.410]
Her husband's administration generally followed Hillary's approach during his two terms president Clinton did not meet with the del Castro

[01:50:37.410 --> 01:50:43.070]
Hoover Chavez or with leaders of Iran Siri and North Korea while generally pursuing a policy of friend isolate these countries

[01:50:43.070 --> 01:50:49.110]
But what did the Clinton approach actually accomplish the respective regimes of Castro and Cuba and Chavez and Venezuela

[01:50:49.110 --> 01:50:52.170]
But only going stronger and more influential all through Latin America

[01:50:52.170 --> 01:50:59.970]
Although Syria was forced to withdraw military forces from Lebanon last year the regime of Bashar Assad as his firmly in French and powers was his fathers and

[01:51:00.550 --> 01:51:05.170]
In spite of the odious politics and qualities of Osmedina jet Iran carries more weight in the Middle East today

[01:51:05.170 --> 01:51:08.750]
That it didn't nearly 90s while American power and standing had declined considerably

[01:51:09.530 --> 01:51:14.690]
Indeed both Clinton and Bush may have missed a historic opportunity to open a new chapter with Iran when reformer

[01:51:14.690 --> 01:51:16.570]
Mohammed Kati me was elected 97

[01:51:16.570 --> 01:51:21.050]
And President Clinton taken the bold step of that was suggested and met with pre without pre-conditioned with

[01:51:21.050 --> 01:51:26.590]
President Kati me and I D.E.R.9 instead of pursuing sanctions might not that democratic reformers be in power in Iran

[01:51:26.590 --> 01:51:32.370]
Might not we have a healthy and growing trading relationship with an economically reformed Iran might Iran have kept its nuclear program

[01:51:32.370 --> 01:51:36.390]
And cooperated with us and managing regional relations including the peaceful downfall of Saddam Hussein

[01:51:36.390 --> 01:51:42.230]
We don't know because the foreign policy sophisticated thought it was too politically risky for Clinton to make such a bold move

[01:51:42.230 --> 01:51:47.690]
Above all foreign policies matter simultaneously projecting American confidence and American humility and

[01:51:47.690 --> 01:51:53.530]
Signalling that he was willing to meet with leaders of these countries Obama was signaling that the US has the confidence in its values to meet with anyone

[01:51:53.530 --> 01:51:57.330]
But he also signals certain humility that reflects the understanding that's an ex-president

[01:51:57.330 --> 01:52:02.650]
Must reach out to the rest of the world a not merely issue conditions from the White House and threaten military force if it

[01:52:03.490 --> 01:52:04.670]
Does not get its way

[01:52:05.530 --> 01:52:10.390]
That's what Katrina says Katrina vanden who a hooverly editor of the nation you go Katrina

[01:52:11.410 --> 01:52:14.270]
But of course Barack Obama they're gonna, you know, whether Osama

[01:52:14.270 --> 01:52:19.410]
Barack Obama and all this every every time he far its it's gonna be the wrong flavor no matter what flavor it was no matter

[01:52:19.410 --> 01:52:21.510]
What he had for breakfast. It's always gonna be the wrong flavor

[01:52:23.190 --> 01:52:26.910]
You know I'm saying what he said and that's because in a racist country like America

[01:52:26.910 --> 01:52:32.450]
He tends to be the wrong flavor. He's got an uphill battle. I mean I'm all for him. I'm 10,000 percent for him

[01:52:33.010 --> 01:52:38.670]
I mean I think he's I mean Dennis Kucinich obviously is great in what he says, but he's you know with the weakest link

[01:52:39.130 --> 01:52:45.370]
He's two feet tall. He's got a bad hair piece. He talks like Jolly, you know other than that. He's a dynamite candidate

[01:52:47.430 --> 01:52:51.350]
He says all the right things but nobody takes him seriously. You know what I mean by that?

[01:52:51.870 --> 01:52:55.370]
Now we're back up to eight on that thing what I think is bouncing up and down back and forth

[01:52:55.370 --> 01:52:59.230]
You people you deadbeats out there with the no good credit cards quit trying to buy stuff

[01:53:00.230 --> 01:53:04.510]
Don't you go see get the feeling that's what's going on. I yeah something's up. We might have

[01:53:04.970 --> 01:53:06.810]
Well, this happens every week sure

[01:53:07.290 --> 01:53:11.070]
But the fact that we still have eight left that doesn't please me in the least but as first we have to you've been

[01:53:11.070 --> 01:53:16.570]
describing all the great child you've had there now including the tiramisu. It's creamy and buttery

[01:53:17.670 --> 01:53:18.770]
Mmm coffee E

[01:53:20.390 --> 01:53:21.070]
yeah

[01:53:21.070 --> 01:53:23.710]
Yeah, no go-ish I see

[01:53:24.450 --> 01:53:31.650]
Well, I'm not gonna settle give you a heavy-duty you can look the whole hour. That's good in the past if you wanted performance

[01:53:31.650 --> 01:53:39.230]
You sacrificed fuel efficiency and if you desire fuel efficiency you had to give up performance until now

[01:53:39.230 --> 01:53:42.270]
Introducing the Toyota Prius 420

[01:53:43.070 --> 01:53:46.750]
It goes 0 to 106.3 doaks

[01:53:46.750 --> 01:53:54.190]
The Toyota Prius 420 comfortably fits you and three of your biggest bugs and this room for three of your friends too

[01:53:54.190 --> 01:53:57.750]
The Prius 420 comes well equipped with leather

[01:53:57.750 --> 01:54:03.610]
Coupled and several small compartments to stash away your valuables plus front-and-side airbags are

[01:54:03.610 --> 01:54:11.150]
Standard comes to the bad cool smoke and track magazine says finally hybrid meets hydroponics

[01:54:11.150 --> 01:54:18.570]
Bong and driver rates it best in grass and its high-time magazines car of the year the Prius 420 from Toyota

[01:54:20.490 --> 01:54:21.970]
What a feeling

[01:54:21.970 --> 01:54:26.730]
4.3 Georgia beyond from one to two day then we'll get those certificates going like hot care

[01:54:26.730 --> 01:54:29.470]
Yeah, you can talk about all the great food that you've just imbibed

[01:54:30.430 --> 01:54:36.130]
The food that you're still eating still eating this tiramisu still sucking down a free food. Oh, yes

[01:54:36.770 --> 01:54:38.610]
When you're making the big bucks. That's right

[01:54:40.190 --> 01:54:42.610]
Now let's see what do we got left we got still stuck on

[01:54:42.610 --> 01:54:48.950]
A fractured or something why I don't know there got to be a glitch. There's got to be a glitch

[01:54:48.950 --> 01:54:51.490]
I know I had a glitch. Yeah, let me say it again

[01:54:51.490 --> 01:54:55.190]
If you scratch it on there the regular way just click on my ugly picture in the upper left hand corner

[01:54:55.190 --> 01:54:59.750]
Works as the nea larger show and when you get to that page with my ugly face on it in the right hand column

[01:54:59.750 --> 01:55:03.450]
You'll find that the thing and that one works that link works

[01:55:03.450 --> 01:55:06.350]
I mean Chris is trying to give me a bunch of crap

[01:55:06.350 --> 01:55:08.250]
You know, but then is there anything new about that?

[01:55:08.370 --> 01:55:13.310]
That Thompson's got to calm. Although certainly wouldn't it be remiss if I didn't read this not all that long

[01:55:13.310 --> 01:55:19.810]
The tyrannical reign of King George duck Thompson on Capitol Hill blue dot com which has always been Georgia's very favorite political web

[01:55:19.810 --> 01:55:20.170]
Yes

[01:55:21.390 --> 01:55:25.850]
He says bush wins because Congress does nothing and I would say as usual he is

[01:55:27.470 --> 01:55:32.650]
Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez returned to Capitol Hill Tuesday and he'll be always does when he testifies before Congress

[01:55:32.650 --> 01:55:33.450]
He lied

[01:55:34.630 --> 01:55:40.310]
Gonzalez lied so often that reporting the fact that he lied as no longer news if the Attorney General's lips are moving

[01:55:40.310 --> 01:55:43.410]
You can bet he's lying his latest round of lies

[01:55:43.410 --> 01:55:46.470]
claiming he didn't breathe lawmakers about a terrorist surveillance program directly

[01:55:46.470 --> 01:55:51.550]
Comfort it's a four-page memo from the Office of National Intelligence Director's Office showing that Gonzalez did in fact

[01:55:51.550 --> 01:55:58.230]
Discuss the program with a congressional leaders angry senators including Republican Arlen Spectre said they may need a special prosecutor

[01:55:58.230 --> 01:56:01.290]
To bring Gonzalez to justice for perjury. Yeah, right

[01:56:01.810 --> 01:56:09.130]
It is a fact that Gonzalez lies. It's also a fact that nothing will be done about it because Congress in the West is led by a democratic party that talks a big game

[01:56:09.130 --> 01:56:10.510]
But can't deliver in the clutch

[01:56:11.650 --> 01:56:15.050]
Kind of like Joel Feinberg talks a big game can't deliver in the clutch

[01:56:16.210 --> 01:56:20.530]
Gonzalez has been caught lying so many times that he should have lost his job months ago yet here he is

[01:56:20.530 --> 01:56:22.090]
We turn to the hell to lie some more

[01:56:22.870 --> 01:56:27.250]
Over in the house the jenny's year a community voted to site former White House counsel Harry admirers

[01:56:27.250 --> 01:56:33.490]
Might our chief of staff Josh Bolton for contempt for refusing to testify about they politically motivated firing of US attorneys big deal

[01:56:34.110 --> 01:56:38.250]
The White House is already announced that it will not allow the justice department to investigate any such content

[01:56:38.250 --> 01:56:40.510]
Nor will the department be allowed to enforce the will of Congress

[01:56:41.330 --> 01:56:46.670]
Yes, there's a pattern here Congress blows a lot of hot air president George W. Bush goes on his merry way

[01:56:47.170 --> 01:56:53.470]
Congress votes to bring the troops home from Iraq Bush veto is the bill it goes back to the Hill but Democrats don't have the votes to sustain a veto

[01:56:54.830 --> 01:57:01.130]
Congress passed a law Bush doesn't like he amends the bill with a signing statement that says allow us him to ignore any provision of the bill he doesn't like

[01:57:01.630 --> 01:57:06.010]
Over the last six years Bush has found a lot of things he doesn't like in bills coming out of Congress and

[01:57:06.010 --> 01:57:11.390]
Mended more than through signing statements than any president in history Congress bitches and moans and then doesn't do anything

[01:57:11.970 --> 01:57:19.570]
The court find Bush's action is domestic spying program unconstitutional Bush ignores the court ruling and proceeds and the court does nothing

[01:57:20.310 --> 01:57:25.650]
And six years Bush aided and evaded by price president Dick Cheney and the politically devious Carl Rove

[01:57:26.150 --> 01:57:31.930]
Has turned the presidency in an absolute monarchy that answers to no one not to Congress not to the courts and not to

[01:57:31.930 --> 01:57:33.490]
Constituutions certainly not to the people

[01:57:34.630 --> 01:57:41.890]
Congress moans and frets and does nothing some Democratic House members want to impeach Bush and Cheney house speaker Nancy Pelosi says no impeachment is off the table

[01:57:41.890 --> 01:57:47.010]
Senator Russ Fangle wants Bush at least sent you to have the Senate but majority leader Harry Reid says no

[01:57:48.130 --> 01:57:53.710]
Last November voters in this country put the Democrats in charge of Congress of the mandate to do something about the despotic rule of George

[01:57:53.710 --> 01:57:59.010]
W. Bush and said the Democrats like the corrupt Republican leadership that covered for Bush for 12 years did nothing

[01:57:59.010 --> 01:58:04.510]
It's time for a third choice. That's what Doug Thompson say. How about that Thompson for prison?

Okay, I'll take it and Michael Moore for a V. Okay

[01:58:10.310 --> 01:58:13.370]
And you know Doug can he can make the decisions of Michael can eat and

[01:58:14.350 --> 01:58:17.690]
And then he'll get real sick and then you know clean up the medical profession. What do you think?

[01:58:18.670 --> 01:58:23.930]
You see that movie yet. So that's what you did. Yes. It's no Magnolia, but then what is?

[01:58:24.650 --> 01:58:27.690]
What could be I can't believe the way you just rip and tear it at that movie?

[01:58:27.870 --> 01:58:33.210]
I don't know why you got such a bug. I can't believe how you keep making up what I say still eight votes on the eight not eight votes

[01:58:33.210 --> 01:58:35.270]
Still a certificate slug for Joseph son of water

[01:58:36.330 --> 01:58:42.510]
Now last week we in 19 minutes we sold out am I right? Yeah, there's got to be a snag or something going on here

Then you can have as much a girlfriend out of yourself for a puppy

[01:58:55.650 --> 01:58:58.370]
That's right. Well, I'll share with her girlfriend of course

[01:59:00.290 --> 01:59:03.270]
758 votes on a pool. That's not too shabby. What do we start with about 10?

[01:59:04.310 --> 01:59:06.850]

Because you're a Nick Carter's little brother. Isn't that his thing to him?

[02:02:50.670 --> 02:02:54.510]
He is to music what Hillary Clinton is to politics when you say which all would that be?

[02:02:56.270 --> 02:03:00.670]
Aaron Carter because I forget without both of you. He is to music because you're not thinking of tens of years

None what makes any sense doesn't make any sense no

[02:03:28.870 --> 02:03:32.050]
Well, maybe they just maybe the people with the money or the credit cards that are valid

[02:03:32.050 --> 02:03:34.770]

Danielle Cole has won a diamond engagement ring for five years since shortly before she and her fiance moved in together

[02:03:42.870 --> 02:03:44.850]
There was surprise she was pregnant at the time

[02:03:44.850 --> 02:03:48.370]
Otherwise she and Christopher a fiener would probably be long-murried by now

[02:03:48.370 --> 02:03:51.110]
There was surprise she was pregnant. I wonder how that happened

[02:03:51.530 --> 02:03:56.590]

[02:04:45.230 --> 02:04:49.870]
That's up from 29% in the early 80s and 39% in the early 1990s

[02:04:49.870 --> 02:04:55.290]
Clearly it's become a normal part of a mercen-family life says Sheila Kennedy cross-order the upcoming Wisconsin paper

[02:05:03.630 --> 02:05:06.230]
Childhood it's called mass chaos

[02:05:09.610 --> 02:05:11.130]
Childhood it's not a real

[02:05:11.950 --> 02:05:15.690]
But a woman with little men in mind

[02:05:17.910 --> 02:05:21.450]
Unfifth it's called WQA

[02:05:22.570 --> 02:05:28.530]
They need to send these stars from breathe and they need to go, go, go

[02:05:29.350 --> 02:05:33.130]
Then they lower hand and power a silt and jump

[02:05:33.130 --> 02:05:38.630]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, Britney thinks she's fine

[02:05:38.630 --> 02:05:41.950]
But she out of her mind

[02:05:41.950 --> 02:05:45.090]
They've been sent a back and breathe

[02:05:45.090 --> 02:05:48.130]
Britney, go, go, go

[02:05:49.690 --> 02:05:53.610]
I know they think that they're okay

[02:05:55.290 --> 02:06:00.330]
But they need 28 more days

[02:06:01.330 --> 02:06:06.890]
Cause they're right back, they're right back in the clubs

[02:06:06.890 --> 02:06:14.330]
What did they learn from the hospital stay?

[02:06:17.330 --> 02:06:20.030]
I am so surprised

[02:06:22.330 --> 02:06:28.570]
That none of these chicks have died

[02:06:28.570 --> 02:06:34.390]
They need to send these stars from breathe and they need to go, go, go

[02:06:35.570 --> 02:06:38.650]

They say that they're fine

[02:06:44.870 --> 02:06:47.910]
But you know it's one big lie

[02:06:48.570 --> 02:06:54.070]
They better send the stars from breathe and they better go, go, go

[02:06:54.070 --> 02:07:01.290]
One o'clock, 5'60m WQAM, I'm here talking about the similarities between cooking and doing what we do with Joseph Sayer last name officially

[02:07:01.290 --> 02:07:01.930]
Maggi

[02:07:01.930 --> 02:07:02.650]
Maggi?

[02:07:02.910 --> 02:07:11.510]
So that's all right, we'll need to say, we were first we were saying Maggi and then Maggi and I guess those are Zoroastrian priests like the ones that visited Jesus

[02:07:12.070 --> 02:07:14.210]
And then Maggi, we were saying Maggi, where are you from?

[02:07:14.930 --> 02:07:15.930]
Originally New Haven Connecticut

[02:07:15.930 --> 02:07:18.510]
You're having Connecticut, what ethnicity is that name? Is that like Italian?

[02:07:18.730 --> 02:07:19.090]
It's Italian

[02:07:19.090 --> 02:07:19.570]
Excellent

[02:07:19.570 --> 02:07:22.250]
And the food is excellent, we're going to talk about that in a second

[02:07:22.250 --> 02:07:30.550]
But yeah, whenever people come into the studio we've had a lot of guests these days restaurant guests and so I've had that conversation with several of the chefs that have been in here

[02:07:30.550 --> 02:07:40.050]
This is pretty amazing how you guys do this and I say it's exactly the same thing that you guys do in a kitchen especially when you're a chef mixing all these elements together at a certain time, amounts and times

[02:07:40.050 --> 02:07:46.450]
And things like that because I did the cooking thing although it's not the same thing that you do because you're an actual, you know, we were just following a procedure

[02:07:46.450 --> 02:07:49.430]
You guys are creative, hopefully like we are over here

[02:07:50.310 --> 02:07:55.370]
So you asked me how long I've been in the radio business, how long have you been chef-ing, how long have you been cooking?

[02:07:55.530 --> 02:07:58.170]
Well actually I haven't been cooking

[02:07:58.170 --> 02:07:59.970]
Yeah, tell them now for a number of years

[02:07:59.970 --> 02:08:03.370]
Tell them you're busy, you're doing an important radio interview right now

[02:08:04.090 --> 02:08:06.870]
Hey, mine goes off all the time too, you saw me text and I'll join this show

[02:08:07.230 --> 02:08:13.970]
I grew up with this fun business, my whole life I was making pizzas from 11 years old to 16 years old

[02:08:14.610 --> 02:08:16.370]
And my friend is restaurant Connecticut

[02:08:18.390 --> 02:08:19.050]
Heated's a business

[02:08:19.050 --> 02:08:22.230]
Really? That's funny business, because I hated talk radio when I get into it, I don't want to quit

[02:08:22.230 --> 02:08:26.750]
Yeah, that's bizarre, then the Neil thing happened, that's another story, we'll talk about that some other day

[02:08:27.210 --> 02:08:31.730]
But you have, because the copy here, we didn't know anything about you until we started doing this for you

[02:08:33.150 --> 02:08:35.430]
This is not your first restaurant, Joseph's on the water

[02:08:35.430 --> 02:08:38.110]
No, we have a fish grill in Dainia for 21 years

[02:08:38.110 --> 02:08:38.430]
Okay

[02:08:38.430 --> 02:08:44.050]
And then in 01 sold it, took two years sabbatical

[02:08:44.490 --> 02:08:52.150]
And then in 03 the people on the board of directors at the Hemisphere's complex in Helen Dale got a hold of me

[02:08:52.150 --> 02:08:57.430]
Have known me for many many many years and asked me if I'd be interested in coming over there

[02:08:57.430 --> 02:09:02.710]
They had one of their restaurants coming available and I hadn't even heard of the first place

[02:09:02.710 --> 02:09:03.930]
Yeah, he got, I'm sorry

[02:09:03.930 --> 02:09:04.990]
Sound off like you have a pair

[02:09:04.990 --> 02:09:06.510]
Yeah, were you in the military?

[02:09:06.930 --> 02:09:07.290]
No

[02:09:08.430 --> 02:09:09.550]
No, neither, neither, neither, neither

[02:09:09.550 --> 02:09:11.670]
Well, you're a popular guy, I'm sorry

[02:09:11.670 --> 02:09:16.970]
At least I put my phone on silent, so when I got text from my mistress, it doesn't die due to you on the air

[02:09:17.510 --> 02:09:19.870]
I'm very excited about going there, my wife is too

[02:09:19.870 --> 02:09:20.950]
Thank you, appreciate it

[02:09:20.950 --> 02:09:22.590]
We'll flip a coin to see who gets to go first

[02:09:23.750 --> 02:09:26.150]
And the Hootsies are probably going to want to go there

[02:09:26.150 --> 02:09:29.210]
Well, you know, we had that big data, I showed you the presentation, over there

[02:09:30.190 --> 02:09:34.630]
Everybody was so warm and wonderful and now we are talking about stage 2

[02:09:34.630 --> 02:09:37.150]
Either with the same Hootsies or with a different pair

[02:09:37.150 --> 02:09:38.590]
Maybe one's on the air

[02:09:38.590 --> 02:09:39.290]
Maybe Josh will come

[02:09:39.290 --> 02:09:41.050]
I thought you meant maybe Breece you walked in here

[02:09:41.050 --> 02:09:42.490]
Yeah, very nice girl

[02:09:42.490 --> 02:09:46.990]
Very nice girl and so I'm talking about taking her and Lucy Lopez down

[02:09:46.990 --> 02:09:50.410]
Well, we want to mix it up, take them to new and exciting places

[02:09:50.410 --> 02:09:51.490]
What did you bring us over here?

[02:09:51.550 --> 02:09:54.510]
Because I forgot already, I know the Terremisu was great, I didn't have any of the Flun

[02:09:54.510 --> 02:09:56.890]
Or the other really fun, but I might take some of that home

[02:09:57.430 --> 02:10:00.910]
We have a couple guys on the kitchen, Latin persuasion

[02:10:00.910 --> 02:10:04.290]
And so our Flun is, you've very, very persuaded them to be Latin?

[02:10:04.750 --> 02:10:04.750]

[02:10:06.110 --> 02:10:07.550]
We did down the road actually

[02:10:09.250 --> 02:10:11.150]
And you brought, I can't remember what you were

[02:10:11.150 --> 02:10:13.170]
It was just a snapper grouper

[02:10:13.830 --> 02:10:15.450]
Run it down because I forgot

[02:10:15.450 --> 02:10:16.210]
Sure, it won't happen

[02:10:16.210 --> 02:10:17.850]
Tell us what you're proud of at your restaurant

[02:10:18.570 --> 02:10:19.750]
We're very heavy in seafood

[02:10:20.430 --> 02:10:23.430]
But there's many, many, many non-sea food lovers out there

[02:10:23.430 --> 02:10:29.390]
Because those individuals we have a very extensive steaks, red meats, everything from beer shops

[02:10:30.510 --> 02:10:32.090]
And we've brought some like a lamb today

[02:10:32.090 --> 02:10:34.570]
Yeah, I've had some lamb, it's just a prejudicial thing

[02:10:34.570 --> 02:10:36.070]
I've always had bad experiences with it

[02:10:36.070 --> 02:10:37.090]
Christian enjoyed it

[02:10:37.090 --> 02:10:38.510]
Yeah, I did

[02:10:38.510 --> 02:10:39.390]
It's very good

[02:10:39.390 --> 02:10:42.690]
It was a very short list of things I'm not crazy about, lamb and scallops

[02:10:42.690 --> 02:10:43.710]
You'd be surprised at the raspberry

[02:10:43.710 --> 02:10:48.310]
I don't know, I know raspberries are huge and you guys in the fancy restaurant business

[02:10:48.310 --> 02:10:50.190]
You put raspberry on everything, don't you?

[02:10:50.250 --> 02:10:52.530]
The desserts of the raspberry, they put raspberry on the cheque

[02:10:52.530 --> 02:10:53.450]
They put raspberry on the cheque, they put raspberry on the cheque

[02:10:53.450 --> 02:10:55.430]
They give you raspberries and you walk in there

[02:10:55.430 --> 02:10:57.290]
They have a big, low raspberry in the past

[02:10:58.090 --> 02:10:59.110]
What about strawberries?

[02:10:59.510 --> 02:11:00.330]
What ever happened to strawberries?

[02:11:00.530 --> 02:11:03.810]
It used to be strawberries and somebody, one of you to people, one of you chef types

[02:11:03.810 --> 02:11:05.530]
And you really fancy people

[02:11:05.530 --> 02:11:07.590]
And it's going to be raspberries now forever

[02:11:08.290 --> 02:11:10.230]
I've seen blackberries though more and more

[02:11:10.230 --> 02:11:11.990]
I taste them blackberries are very, very good for you

[02:11:11.990 --> 02:11:13.710]
I love them because we were talking about North Carolina

[02:11:13.710 --> 02:11:16.990]
We got the wild blackberries all over the place up there

[02:11:16.990 --> 02:11:18.090]
Right, and there's a wonderful

[02:11:18.090 --> 02:11:20.810]
I will just shred my hands up because they got thorns

[02:11:20.810 --> 02:11:21.830]
They got nasty thorns

[02:11:21.830 --> 02:11:24.890]
Oh, shred my hands up, picking blackberries whenever they're going on

[02:11:24.890 --> 02:11:25.750]
They're wonderful

[02:11:25.750 --> 02:11:30.010]
I have no idea, I know they're great for the fancy restaurant business

[02:11:30.010 --> 02:11:31.250]
Because raspberries blow

[02:11:31.250 --> 02:11:32.450]
I hate them

[02:11:33.830 --> 02:11:36.770]
Somebody, I wanted before we run out of time

[02:11:36.770 --> 02:11:38.790]
I wanted you to give people directions

[02:11:38.790 --> 02:11:39.290]
Nice

[02:11:39.290 --> 02:11:40.630]
In a nice way

[02:11:40.630 --> 02:11:41.850]
Because it is

[02:11:41.850 --> 02:11:44.190]
And I equated to Burton Jax

[02:11:44.190 --> 02:11:46.070]
Remember before terrorism shut them down

[02:11:46.070 --> 02:11:47.770]
It was a very difficult place to get to

[02:11:47.770 --> 02:11:49.810]
It was almost impossible to give people direction convoluted

[02:11:49.810 --> 02:11:51.330]
And that's what everyone liked about it

[02:11:51.330 --> 02:11:55.730]
It was very exclusive because you, nobody wound up there

[02:11:55.730 --> 02:11:57.790]
Nobody ever got there by accident

[02:11:57.790 --> 02:11:59.750]
You had to know about it

[02:11:59.750 --> 02:12:02.470]
Know where you were going and it was a big secret

[02:12:02.470 --> 02:12:04.230]
And that was all part of the fun

[02:12:04.230 --> 02:12:05.850]
So, Duff was all concerned

[02:12:05.850 --> 02:12:07.870]
And he typed these directions out

[02:12:07.870 --> 02:12:08.850]
And everything like that

[02:12:08.850 --> 02:12:10.350]
And I said, just give the phone number out

[02:12:10.350 --> 02:12:11.130]
They'll walk them in

[02:12:11.130 --> 02:12:13.150]
So, why do you tell people how to find you?

[02:12:13.250 --> 02:12:13.870]
It's really easy

[02:12:13.870 --> 02:12:16.390]
If you're coming down from Hellendale Beach Boulevard

[02:12:16.390 --> 02:12:18.350]
You're going east all the way to the beach

[02:12:19.290 --> 02:12:20.610]
When you can't go any further

[02:12:20.610 --> 02:12:22.750]
Let's say when a witches south ocean drive

[02:12:22.750 --> 02:12:23.410]
You take a ride

[02:12:23.410 --> 02:12:25.510]
And you're going down three traffic lights

[02:12:25.510 --> 02:12:27.050]
The third traffic light

[02:12:27.050 --> 02:12:29.370]
The street sign says hemisphere

[02:12:29.370 --> 02:12:32.070]
Hence the also the complex of hemispheres

[02:12:32.070 --> 02:12:35.190]
You take another right at that street sign

[02:12:35.190 --> 02:12:38.490]
But you cannot see us from the street

[02:12:38.490 --> 02:12:41.450]
Because we do sit back on the property on the inner grisle

[02:12:41.450 --> 02:12:42.890]
Sure, you go up in the water

[02:12:42.890 --> 02:12:45.450]
You got the huge, beautiful, got 100 feet of down with water

[02:12:45.450 --> 02:12:47.370]
Real nice inside, outside

[02:12:47.370 --> 02:12:48.370]
Exactly that

[02:12:48.370 --> 02:12:50.010]
Patio dining or inside dining

[02:12:50.790 --> 02:12:52.930]
Every night we have cabaret

[02:12:53.850 --> 02:12:55.710]
We have a piano bar

[02:12:55.710 --> 02:12:57.510]
Five dancing

[02:12:57.510 --> 02:12:58.490]
Not dancing

[02:12:58.490 --> 02:12:59.370]
Not dancing

[02:13:00.130 --> 02:13:02.070]
Customers use the night the night the vanilla

[02:13:02.070 --> 02:13:03.530]
Joe and Joe play

[02:13:06.810 --> 02:13:09.930]
Actually, it's wonderful for either

[02:13:09.930 --> 02:13:12.450]
Dining or conversation

[02:13:12.450 --> 02:13:13.630]
Or cocktails

[02:13:13.630 --> 02:13:15.190]
Any one of the above

[02:13:15.190 --> 02:13:17.550]
And of course the destination being outside

[02:13:17.550 --> 02:13:18.710]
When the evening is really nice

[02:13:18.710 --> 02:13:21.810]
So let me ask you this as a, you know, because you're a chef so you light

[02:13:21.810 --> 02:13:23.470]
Well I'm not really chef by trade

[02:13:23.890 --> 02:13:25.950]
I've cooked for many many many many years

[02:13:26.630 --> 02:13:29.530]
And now I'm in the front green people saying hi, how are you?

[02:13:30.030 --> 02:13:32.810]
What a fun, but you get to eat whatever that hell you want

[02:13:32.810 --> 02:13:33.370]
Oh no, absolutely

[02:13:33.810 --> 02:13:37.350]
What a great hooker we're talking about every day about every business has its perks like mine

[02:13:37.350 --> 02:13:40.370]
I get to take other people's girlfriends out of the fridge of the job

[02:13:40.370 --> 02:13:42.670]
And pretend that you could just all be great

[02:13:42.670 --> 02:13:44.130]
To a trade, to a coin switch

[02:13:44.710 --> 02:13:46.070]
That's possible? Let's do it for a nice period

[02:13:46.070 --> 02:13:47.210]
We've got something like that you bet

[02:13:48.490 --> 02:13:54.170]
You've eaten meat and now we've eaten meat and let people, you know, grease my palm for good seat

[02:13:54.610 --> 02:13:55.410]
Yeah, there you go

[02:13:55.410 --> 02:13:56.690]
Meat take back for a good seat

[02:13:57.490 --> 02:13:59.430]
And anything I want, I get to eat

[02:13:59.430 --> 02:14:00.250]
Thank you

[02:14:00.250 --> 02:14:03.190]
So what do you like since it's your place?

[02:14:03.690 --> 02:14:08.250]
What do you like? See this is like the guy that can have anything to eat? What does he like best?

[02:14:08.450 --> 02:14:08.730]
Well I like it

[02:14:08.730 --> 02:14:11.250]
If it's, we're very heavy in seafood

[02:14:11.250 --> 02:14:13.330]
If it's seafood, I'm going after it

[02:14:13.330 --> 02:14:16.170]
I'm sure there's everybody likes seafood for the most part of the world

[02:14:16.170 --> 02:14:17.750]
And the wrong place if you don't

[02:14:17.750 --> 02:14:18.810]
Yeah, you really are

[02:14:18.810 --> 02:14:23.970]
I mean down here, everyone's coming down and probably one of the main questions they ask all the concierge in hotels is

[02:14:23.970 --> 02:14:25.330]
Want a good seafood restaurant

[02:14:25.850 --> 02:14:26.790]
Sure, sure

[02:14:26.790 --> 02:14:30.750]
We better be able to live up to that or what's the point of being on the water

[02:14:30.750 --> 02:14:31.790]
Well you'd be surprised

[02:14:31.790 --> 02:14:33.750]
Even though we have been surprised

[02:14:33.750 --> 02:14:35.550]
Yeah, the more very surprised

[02:14:35.550 --> 02:14:38.470]
And it's never see seafood as an unpleasant surprise

[02:14:38.470 --> 02:14:39.830]
When it's not good

[02:14:39.830 --> 02:14:41.830]
And it'll put you off of it for a long time

[02:14:41.830 --> 02:14:42.150]
Absolutely

[02:14:42.150 --> 02:14:46.150]
Like one bad fish meal put you off for like a couple months at least

[02:14:46.150 --> 02:14:47.870]
So many places are using frozen

[02:14:47.870 --> 02:14:49.590]
I love that expression fresh frozen

[02:14:49.590 --> 02:14:50.150]
I mean

[02:14:51.830 --> 02:14:53.730]
That's right, that's an oxymoron

[02:14:53.730 --> 02:14:54.530]
I like it

[02:14:55.130 --> 02:15:00.590]
It's so much easier to obviously use a frozen filet because you have as many as you want

[02:15:00.590 --> 02:15:03.730]
Anytime you want and you can do what you want with it

[02:15:03.730 --> 02:15:05.630]
But then again when you do that

[02:15:05.630 --> 02:15:06.870]
The taste is just

[02:15:06.870 --> 02:15:07.810]
Sure, and the texture

[02:15:08.670 --> 02:15:10.170]
Absolutely, you can tell from

[02:15:10.910 --> 02:15:12.230]
It's weeping on the plate

[02:15:12.870 --> 02:15:15.030]
Right, now fresh fish is where it's at

[02:15:15.030 --> 02:15:18.810]
It takes a lot more pain and trouble

[02:15:18.810 --> 02:15:20.530]
So you still have an answer what's your favorite thing?

[02:15:20.650 --> 02:15:22.730]
My favorite is either black and

[02:15:23.490 --> 02:15:24.170]
pardon me

[02:15:24.170 --> 02:15:25.030]
Either black

[02:15:26.110 --> 02:15:29.050]
Grupper, Atlantic black, which is what we had over the nominal

[02:15:29.050 --> 02:15:29.630]
I love Grupper

[02:15:29.630 --> 02:15:31.050]
The yellow tail is wonderful

[02:15:31.510 --> 02:15:34.610]
The tuna we use a 2 plus quality with that means is

[02:15:36.430 --> 02:15:36.870]
One

[02:15:38.210 --> 02:15:41.090]
Number one tuna usually goes to Japan

[02:15:41.090 --> 02:15:44.330]
It says the highest end tuna is they just say they go nuts for it

[02:15:44.330 --> 02:15:45.510]
They do all the time for the sashimi

[02:15:45.510 --> 02:15:48.710]
And if you serve them bad sashimi they'll kill you

[02:15:48.710 --> 02:15:49.750]
Yeah, but they'll pay right through

[02:15:49.750 --> 02:15:50.830]
They pay they pay

[02:15:50.830 --> 02:15:54.190]
Sure, and 2 plus quality is the next

[02:15:54.850 --> 02:15:55.290]
Grade

[02:15:56.190 --> 02:15:57.470]
Under, number one

[02:15:57.470 --> 02:15:58.710]
And that's all you use

[02:15:58.710 --> 02:16:00.450]
You cut that with a spoon

[02:16:00.450 --> 02:16:02.450]
Right, just just a wonderful product

[02:16:03.150 --> 02:16:04.310]
And fresh, like I said

[02:16:04.310 --> 02:16:07.910]
Well usually, well no, we don't do anything sushi-wise

[02:16:08.450 --> 02:16:10.290]
But what we do is we take the fresh tuna

[02:16:10.730 --> 02:16:15.430]
And we'll lightly cover it with black and white sesame seeds

[02:16:15.430 --> 02:16:16.930]
And then we'll pan-sear it

[02:16:17.490 --> 02:16:19.410]
Usually we like it to be pan-seared around here

[02:16:19.410 --> 02:16:20.330]
And that's your thing

[02:16:20.330 --> 02:16:21.470]
You go for it

[02:16:21.470 --> 02:16:22.790]
Really nice, that's all good

[02:16:22.790 --> 02:16:23.810]
And the Grupper, big time

[02:16:24.390 --> 02:16:25.490]
The Grupper is great

[02:16:25.490 --> 02:16:28.170]
And we prepare any of the fish five or six different ways

[02:16:28.170 --> 02:16:32.110]
We will boil it, we'll bake it, we'll blacken it, we'll do it souffle

[02:16:32.110 --> 02:16:34.410]
We'll do it Mediterranean style

[02:16:34.410 --> 02:16:36.230]
Any way you like to beat it, smell it

[02:16:36.230 --> 02:16:37.030]
We'll whack it around

[02:16:37.770 --> 02:16:38.850]
It's crazy, makes it different

[02:16:39.310 --> 02:16:41.810]
That sounds wonderful, then you got the steaks and everything like that

[02:16:41.810 --> 02:16:44.610]
Yeah, a lot of red meat because there's many, many people that are not

[02:16:44.610 --> 02:16:44.990]
Oh yeah

[02:16:44.990 --> 02:16:46.870]
Oh, it's in the sea that way or another

[02:16:47.550 --> 02:16:48.270]
Carried the bottle

[02:16:48.890 --> 02:16:51.110]
Because yeah, because that's me, because I'm a pig

[02:16:51.850 --> 02:16:52.590]
No, I don't think so

[02:16:52.590 --> 02:16:54.890]
You saw me eat, you know what, you might be right

[02:16:55.310 --> 02:16:57.510]
And I'm trying to eat like that all the time

[02:16:57.510 --> 02:16:58.770]
But I'm going not to

[02:16:58.770 --> 02:17:02.370]
And I'm just saving it for Thursdays trying to just keep it under control for Thursdays

[02:17:02.370 --> 02:17:06.230]
Because I'm not going to pass up the opportunity to have the food that our fine sponsors bring in

[02:17:07.230 --> 02:17:09.790]
And we're obligated to go visit you

[02:17:09.790 --> 02:17:13.050]
The question now is how many times am I going to show up there

[02:17:13.050 --> 02:17:14.030]
Oh, I hope a lot

[02:17:14.030 --> 02:17:16.390]
Many different, you know, bunches of huchis

[02:17:16.390 --> 02:17:17.370]
Am I going to not say you know me

[02:17:18.610 --> 02:17:19.950]
As many as you can handle, I guess

[02:17:20.510 --> 02:17:22.410]
Hey, that sounds like a challenge

[02:17:23.210 --> 02:17:27.970]
I'll see what I can do, you know, because I know radio huchis and they're just like us

[02:17:27.970 --> 02:17:31.210]
They'll go anywhere for free meal and so

[02:17:31.210 --> 02:17:36.090]
And I can't say that they'll do anything because I haven't tried to get them to do everything yet

[02:17:36.090 --> 02:17:38.290]
But they'll do a lot for a free meal

[02:17:38.290 --> 02:17:40.130]
You may be surprised, radio people, male or female

[02:17:40.130 --> 02:17:41.410]
They'll do a lot for a free meal

[02:17:41.950 --> 02:17:42.410]
That's nice

[02:17:42.410 --> 02:17:44.850]
Yeah, so we've got some radio hose

[02:17:46.410 --> 02:17:51.470]
That might be interested in some free fine fish and steaks over there

[02:17:51.470 --> 02:17:52.610]
Joseph's on the water

[02:17:52.610 --> 02:17:55.370]
Want to give your phone number out so that more people won't remember

[02:17:55.370 --> 02:17:56.610]
They're not going to write these directions down

[02:17:56.610 --> 02:17:57.990]
They're just going to call and make a reservation

[02:17:57.990 --> 02:18:00.190]
Well, the website, they can get on their website

[02:18:00.850 --> 02:18:01.630]
Josephswannthewater.com

[02:18:01.630 --> 02:18:04.570]
And there you can see the menu, you can see the inside of the restaurant

[02:18:05.310 --> 02:18:06.070]
Lovely ambience

[02:18:06.070 --> 02:18:07.270]
Outside in the patio

[02:18:08.070 --> 02:18:10.350]
We have like a 100 feet of dockage for boats

[02:18:10.890 --> 02:18:11.770]
Full liquor bar

[02:18:13.010 --> 02:18:13.530]
It's lovely

[02:18:13.970 --> 02:18:18.070]
I can just drop in like if on crack and prostitute night if I'm driving by with the hose

[02:18:18.070 --> 02:18:19.550]
I just like hey, ho

[02:18:19.550 --> 02:18:21.910]
You want to stop and hear and have some fish

[02:18:21.910 --> 02:18:23.850]
I know the guy, he'll hook us up

[02:18:24.570 --> 02:18:25.350]
I'm on a budget

[02:18:25.870 --> 02:18:27.330]
I want to impress chicks

[02:18:27.330 --> 02:18:29.610]
Like a rich guy but I don't have the money

[02:18:29.610 --> 02:18:31.370]
So I think we're all in the same room

[02:18:31.370 --> 02:18:34.290]
For all these connections over here to make it look like I'm a big shot

[02:18:34.290 --> 02:18:35.410]
Actually, I'll tell you something

[02:18:36.290 --> 02:18:38.070]
Because we are, it's hard to find this

[02:18:38.870 --> 02:18:39.770]
It's a bit convoluted

[02:18:40.890 --> 02:18:42.310]
It's off the beaten track

[02:18:42.310 --> 02:18:43.170]
That's a draw

[02:18:43.730 --> 02:18:45.150]
Well, in itself, I mean, it's funny

[02:18:45.150 --> 02:18:47.730]
People will say it's the best kept streak going

[02:18:47.730 --> 02:18:49.010]
It really is

[02:18:49.570 --> 02:18:50.890]
Or we're gonna let it out

[02:18:50.890 --> 02:18:52.950]
We're gonna let it out

[02:18:52.950 --> 02:18:58.770]
Believe me, people coming in once an individual comes in, we see them often quite often

[02:18:59.250 --> 02:19:00.390]
They like tiramisu

[02:19:00.910 --> 02:19:03.830]
And if they go in their north of the tiramisu and they don't like it, they can come to it

[02:19:03.830 --> 02:19:04.890]
And punch me in the stomach

[02:19:05.550 --> 02:19:06.970]
You don't have a stomach anymore

[02:19:06.970 --> 02:19:08.150]
No, well, I can tighten it up

[02:19:08.150 --> 02:19:10.670]
They have to warn me, not like that Houdini thing

[02:19:10.670 --> 02:19:12.410]
Don't catch me on the wears, let me tighten it up first

[02:19:12.410 --> 02:19:13.330]
Then you can punch me in the stomach

[02:19:13.330 --> 02:19:16.890]
Only if you didn't like tiramisu and you better convince me that you didn't

[02:19:16.890 --> 02:19:18.330]
Because it was the best tiramisu I've had in my life

[02:19:18.330 --> 02:19:19.470]
And it's one of my favorite things

[02:19:19.470 --> 02:19:21.470]
So it's rage, I might go there and just have dessert

[02:19:22.550 --> 02:19:24.670]
I'll ask the Houdci if that's what she wants to do

[02:19:25.310 --> 02:19:26.850]
Thank you so much Joseph, we're out of time

[02:19:26.850 --> 02:19:28.250]
Thank you for feeding us today

[02:19:28.250 --> 02:19:30.310]
Hope you're enjoying your place up

[02:19:30.310 --> 02:19:32.070]
Thanks George, for Joseph's on the water

[02:19:32.070 --> 02:19:33.510]
Helen Dale Beach Boulevard

[02:19:34.070 --> 02:19:35.190]
Call them and ask for directions

[02:19:35.190 --> 02:19:36.450]
I'm not going to remember

[02:19:36.950 --> 02:19:38.970]
113 on 560 WQAM

[02:20:02.070 --> 02:20:04.250]
The streets I say from dangerous curves

[02:20:04.250 --> 02:20:05.850]
And western style haircuts

[02:20:05.850 --> 02:20:08.610]
Is the job of the brave men and women of

[02:20:08.610 --> 02:20:10.270]
Fashion cops Tehran

[02:20:10.270 --> 02:20:12.290]
We are approaching the trailer park

[02:20:12.290 --> 02:20:14.890]
Where a man is apparently using products

[02:20:14.890 --> 02:20:16.350]
Possibly hergell

[02:20:16.350 --> 02:20:18.730]
He is considered quite and dangerous

[02:20:18.730 --> 02:20:20.310]
Hey buddy, hey buddy

[02:20:20.310 --> 02:20:21.910]
What is in your pocket, eh?

[02:20:22.150 --> 02:20:22.530]
Nothing?

[02:20:22.970 --> 02:20:23.850]
Let me see

[02:20:23.850 --> 02:20:26.190]
A tube of deepened dough

[02:20:26.190 --> 02:20:27.590]
It is not mine

[02:20:27.590 --> 02:20:30.170]
A friend asked me to hold it for him

[02:20:30.170 --> 02:20:32.190]
Who is your friend, Divinilize?

[02:20:32.550 --> 02:20:34.910]
You are going to leave for a long time

[02:20:34.910 --> 02:20:37.070]
Instead of fashion cops Tehran

[02:20:37.070 --> 02:20:38.970]
All suspects are considered

[02:20:38.970 --> 02:20:40.290]
Guilty until proven innocent

[02:20:40.290 --> 02:20:44.730]
Thank you Joseph, thank you for the food

[02:20:44.730 --> 02:20:45.350]
I'll see you

[02:20:45.350 --> 02:20:46.950]
Who knows, maybe sooner than you think

[02:20:46.950 --> 02:20:49.490]
You have no idea what the hell I got going on

[02:20:49.490 --> 02:20:51.690]
560-560 and date in Broward

[02:20:51.690 --> 02:20:55.230]
877-785-634-5 is toll free everywhere else

[02:20:55.230 --> 02:20:57.570]
Palant 560 is free if you have AT&T

[02:20:57.570 --> 02:20:58.690]
And Verizon Wireless

[02:20:58.690 --> 02:20:59.650]
Hey, how you doing over there Chris?

[02:21:00.130 --> 02:21:01.110]
I'm doing great, what about you?

[02:21:01.230 --> 02:21:02.410]
Wow, I need a nap

[02:21:03.390 --> 02:21:04.910]
I think I'm going to have a nap

[02:21:05.550 --> 02:21:07.630]
I think we'll be taking a nap before skating tonight

[02:21:07.630 --> 02:21:08.130]
You're going?

[02:21:08.370 --> 02:21:08.590]
Yes

[02:21:10.430 --> 02:21:13.750]
We'll see if that actually happens

[02:21:14.350 --> 02:21:15.510]
She's threatened that before

[02:21:15.510 --> 02:21:16.650]
She has gone before, you know

[02:21:16.650 --> 02:21:18.650]
She's capable of skating, she has skates

[02:21:19.950 --> 02:21:21.370]
It's just one of these things

[02:21:22.870 --> 02:21:23.790]
It's kind of like that

[02:21:23.790 --> 02:21:24.830]
I'm going to feel that

[02:21:26.910 --> 02:21:28.090]
Normal, good

[02:21:28.610 --> 02:21:30.390]
How much are you not going to be skating backwards like you?

[02:21:30.590 --> 02:21:31.570]
No, no, like you

[02:21:31.970 --> 02:21:32.330]
Good

[02:21:33.130 --> 02:21:34.610]
See, I don't consider myself good

[02:21:34.610 --> 02:21:36.430]
I used to be, that's what I always tell people

[02:21:36.430 --> 02:21:37.130]
I used to be

[02:21:37.130 --> 02:21:39.510]
In that crowd, I'm middle of the pack

[02:21:41.190 --> 02:21:42.930]
For some reason, it doesn't consider themselves good

[02:21:42.930 --> 02:21:44.130]
You hot dog it pretty well

[02:21:44.130 --> 02:21:46.430]
I do my best to hot dog it

[02:21:46.430 --> 02:21:47.910]
But that's still, I don't consider that good

[02:21:47.910 --> 02:21:50.910]
That's just me doing as good as I can

[02:21:50.910 --> 02:21:51.570]
How's that?

[02:21:51.910 --> 02:21:54.170]
Now, was skating the same back last week or no?

[02:21:54.410 --> 02:21:55.690]
I didn't see them last week

[02:21:55.690 --> 02:21:56.710]
So we're going to fill out the competition

[02:21:56.710 --> 02:21:59.010]
Hopefully they did well in the competition

[02:21:59.010 --> 02:22:00.510]
And we will ask them

[02:22:00.510 --> 02:22:01.990]
No, good is what I used to be

[02:22:01.990 --> 02:22:04.990]
And good is what you see some of the other people do on the floor out there

[02:22:05.450 --> 02:22:07.770]
You know, what I do are the basics

[02:22:07.770 --> 02:22:09.370]
And maybe, all right, I'll give you this

[02:22:09.370 --> 02:22:10.470]
I do the basics well

[02:22:11.310 --> 02:22:12.070]
Okay, we'll give you that

[02:22:12.070 --> 02:22:12.790]
Those are the basics

[02:22:13.870 --> 02:22:15.730]
What some of these other people are doing out there

[02:22:15.730 --> 02:22:17.390]
Are some amazing stunts and tricks

[02:22:17.390 --> 02:22:20.090]
What's yeah, used to be able to do that stuff

[02:22:20.090 --> 02:22:21.450]
And then I got old

[02:22:21.450 --> 02:22:23.590]
And maybe I would still be able to do it

[02:22:23.590 --> 02:22:24.970]
If I had never stopped

[02:22:25.570 --> 02:22:28.510]
But you stopped and for, I don't know

[02:22:29.310 --> 02:22:30.310]
Like 20 years

[02:22:31.130 --> 02:22:32.010]
I didn't do anything

[02:22:32.010 --> 02:22:33.830]
Joseph forgot his cell phone

[02:22:33.830 --> 02:22:36.030]
Oh hey, Duff, bring Joseph back

[02:22:36.570 --> 02:22:38.030]
Should I text Duff right here

[02:22:38.030 --> 02:22:38.290]
Yes

[02:22:39.490 --> 02:22:41.010]
I'm going to text Duff Lindsay

[02:22:41.830 --> 02:22:42.890]
Right here Duff

[02:22:42.890 --> 02:22:44.650]
So what is it called, sliding

[02:22:44.950 --> 02:22:47.310]
What is that one that they do where you have to do it

[02:22:47.310 --> 02:22:47.890]
You have to get off the ring

[02:22:48.510 --> 02:22:49.270]
And then kind of all

[02:22:49.270 --> 02:22:50.210]
Shuffle, shuffle

[02:22:51.850 --> 02:22:52.650]
There's nothing to that

[02:22:52.650 --> 02:22:55.170]
I don't even know why they have a special session for shuffling

[02:22:55.170 --> 02:22:55.730]
All right, I'm talking

[02:22:55.730 --> 02:22:58.090]
Because it looks the same time which I do all day long

[02:22:58.550 --> 02:23:00.250]
Joseph, yeah, but they're just bouncing

[02:23:00.250 --> 02:23:01.210]
Is all they're doing

[02:23:02.890 --> 02:23:05.530]
Joseph forgot his, he was so excited about being on the radio

[02:23:05.530 --> 02:23:07.970]
Joseph forgot his phone

[02:23:09.570 --> 02:23:10.990]
Duff texting while talking

[02:23:11.650 --> 02:23:13.610]
Your talent says new skill I've developed

[02:23:13.610 --> 02:23:15.090]
QIM Chris is busy

[02:23:15.650 --> 02:23:17.030]
Yeah, I forgot about that

[02:23:17.030 --> 02:23:17.910]
Don't worry about it

[02:23:17.910 --> 02:23:19.190]
You want it, what do you want?

[02:23:19.990 --> 02:23:20.550]
Talk to George

[02:23:21.090 --> 02:23:23.290]
Okay, go right ahead, turn the radio off and start talking

[02:23:23.990 --> 02:23:24.610]
Oh, George!

[02:23:24.950 --> 02:23:26.510]
No four-play, just like my sex life

[02:23:26.510 --> 02:23:28.230]
Man, that's the way we like it, huh?

[02:23:28.430 --> 02:23:29.150]
Get straight to the point

[02:23:29.150 --> 02:23:31.790]
Yeah, I mean, I like some four-play but you know

[02:23:32.350 --> 02:23:34.410]
Not to say that you're boring or anything, but where's Lucy?

[02:23:35.330 --> 02:23:37.970]
You know, it's not a scheduled day, see what's going on is it's Thursday

[02:23:37.970 --> 02:23:40.910]
And that's all right, I understand, you know, I'd much rather have Lucy right here

[02:23:40.910 --> 02:23:45.650]
I got to tell you honestly, she's really, I don't know what it is, but the interaction you guys have, it sounds great on you

[02:23:45.650 --> 02:23:51.510]
Everybody says the same thing, and I like it, and she likes it, and the audience likes it, we've only had two complaints out of a hundred

[02:23:52.510 --> 02:23:52.870]
Comparatives

[02:23:52.870 --> 02:23:54.750]
You guys will be able to work it out, where you've been

[02:23:54.750 --> 02:23:56.250]
Here, let me tell you what's going to happen

[02:23:56.250 --> 02:24:01.030]
If it's good, the management of this radio station, and every other radio station in this town is going to hate it

[02:24:01.030 --> 02:24:07.950]
There is no suit wearing MFR in this town that knows what good radio is, so there's no chance that anyone that is good will ever have a radio station in this town

[02:24:09.250 --> 02:24:12.130]
So basically before you know it, you and Lucy will be a thing in a pack

[02:24:12.130 --> 02:24:15.930]
We'll be going somewhere to another town or something like that, but yeah, you better believe it

[02:24:15.930 --> 02:24:22.170]
What you will hear a lot of, a really bad, sucking mediocre acts in this town, that they get paid a lot of money to suck and get low ratings

[02:24:22.170 --> 02:24:22.750]
That's what you'll hear

[02:24:23.130 --> 02:24:23.910]
That's what I'm seeing

[02:24:24.830 --> 02:24:26.990]
I guess we'll wait for tomorrow

[02:24:27.350 --> 02:24:31.870]
Yeah, well it's going to be a speaking sense tomorrow, but I told Lucy to make a cameo, she has to give SUDs a lap dance

[02:24:32.790 --> 02:24:33.950]
We'll appreciate it

[02:24:33.950 --> 02:24:39.310]
We're not scheduled to come in today, so she would not you know not even waiting to, although we got to talk some stuff

[02:24:39.310 --> 02:24:42.510]
You do Joseph phone, all right, it's right over here on a on a napkin

[02:24:42.510 --> 02:24:43.390]
QAIM, hello

[02:24:44.230 --> 02:24:47.870]
George, you forgot Meredith Manson and Johnny Depp on the list, man

[02:24:47.870 --> 02:24:49.350]
Put them on there later

[02:24:50.230 --> 02:24:55.270]
Later, would you put Johnny Depp wasn't born here, Johnny Depp we already talked about, he was born where?

[02:24:55.570 --> 02:24:56.390]
Yenem's belt can talk

[02:24:56.390 --> 02:24:57.430]
Can I see you in the long time?

[02:24:58.450 --> 02:25:04.630]
But Marilyn Manson, I know he is a local boy like this is where he got his act started

[02:25:05.630 --> 02:25:07.110]
Oh excuse me, term a superb

[02:25:08.570 --> 02:25:13.430]
But hey, Lucy, by popular demand, look at this, you hear the guy, did you hear what the guy just said?

[02:25:13.850 --> 02:25:16.430]
The guy called up and said hey not that you're boring or anything but where's Lucy?

[02:25:16.730 --> 02:25:17.090]
Sure he am

[02:25:17.090 --> 02:25:21.950]
And I said it was an unscheduled, because it's Thursday, I wasn't even, I'm not even supposed to be on today

[02:25:21.950 --> 02:25:23.270]
I was just saying what are you doing here?

[02:25:23.270 --> 02:25:25.130]
Lazy Fat Fag took off early

[02:25:25.130 --> 02:25:26.930]
Marilyn Manson born in Ohio

[02:25:27.690 --> 02:25:28.950]
Was any born in Florida?

[02:25:29.370 --> 02:25:35.270]
No, Ohio, see a lot of people used to live here like Johnny Depp and Marilyn Manson, they grew up here but they were born somewhere else

[02:25:35.790 --> 02:25:41.510]
Also, being that I'm on QAIM right now, a famous baseball player

[02:25:41.510 --> 02:25:42.810]
What's his name? A-Rod

[02:25:43.310 --> 02:25:45.170]
I don't know, I'm trying to find yet another video

[02:25:45.750 --> 02:25:48.370]
Yeah, Lucy, so Keith Hernandez from the Met

[02:25:49.110 --> 02:25:50.490]
And we're going with Enter Tanner, so

[02:25:50.490 --> 02:25:51.550]
Oh, okay

[02:25:51.550 --> 02:25:54.750]
I don't know, I'm trying to be on QAIM

[02:25:54.750 --> 02:25:56.410]
Let me hear your name, I'm just going to vote

[02:25:56.410 --> 02:25:59.210]
Because you were born here somewhere in the United States?

[02:25:59.250 --> 02:25:59.710]
Yes, I was

[02:25:59.710 --> 02:26:02.350]
You, Miguel, I was born in Jersey

[02:26:02.350 --> 02:26:03.730]
The guy that made this drop for us?

[02:26:03.750 --> 02:26:05.350]
Oh yeah, love him

[02:26:05.350 --> 02:26:07.290]
No, that was Bokeh Brian anyway

[02:26:07.290 --> 02:26:07.930]
Let me hear that

[02:26:08.670 --> 02:26:12.710]
Oh yeah, that's Bokeh Brian speaking with a Spanish accent

[02:26:12.710 --> 02:26:13.910]
Speaking a Spanish accent

[02:26:14.410 --> 02:26:17.790]
Explain to me why you like

[02:26:17.790 --> 02:26:21.370]
Just, just, Jude Lucy Lopez and Miguel Esco-Barn

[02:26:21.370 --> 02:26:23.130]
All these other American born

[02:26:24.090 --> 02:26:24.910]
Have accents?

[02:26:25.130 --> 02:26:25.830]
Have accents

[02:26:27.070 --> 02:26:29.190]
I'm a wreath, you understand I'm a wreath right?

[02:26:29.210 --> 02:26:30.710]
Yeah, I know, I know you're a wreath

[02:26:30.710 --> 02:26:36.270]
But I think it's, I personally feel that I have an accent because all the other kids I went to school with

[02:26:36.270 --> 02:26:37.410]
Have accents

[02:26:37.410 --> 02:26:39.310]
Have accents and if you're rounded

[02:26:39.310 --> 02:26:42.190]
Yeah, and if you're rounded you just pick it up

[02:26:42.190 --> 02:26:42.790]
Well, I know, that's...

[02:26:42.790 --> 02:26:43.830]
Is it going to New York accent?

[02:26:43.830 --> 02:26:45.270]
I learned to talk like this

[02:26:46.290 --> 02:26:47.650]
Before I learned to talk like this

[02:26:47.650 --> 02:26:47.950]
Right

[02:26:48.370 --> 02:26:49.450]
Because of the red lens in New York

[02:26:49.450 --> 02:26:50.710]
I really, I've tried

[02:26:53.230 --> 02:26:53.870]
Very hard

[02:26:53.870 --> 02:26:54.950]
Say hard

[02:26:54.950 --> 02:26:57.570]
I don't want to say it because I've got to top it up that guy called me

[02:26:57.570 --> 02:27:00.570]
He's like, I'm gonna use you in a comedy biv with all these things

[02:27:00.570 --> 02:27:03.210]
I got a request for a drop the thing that you said to the little goodbye wish

[02:27:03.210 --> 02:27:04.890]
Yesterday about the thing with mustaches

[02:27:04.890 --> 02:27:06.770]
That's a great drop, we have to cart that up

[02:27:06.770 --> 02:27:08.550]
Look at me, how old I am, cart that up

[02:27:08.550 --> 02:27:09.870]
I don't even know what to call it anymore

[02:27:10.490 --> 02:27:11.370]
This is a cart

[02:27:11.370 --> 02:27:13.310]
And we've learned somebody, this is a cart

[02:27:13.870 --> 02:27:14.290]
A cartridge

[02:27:14.290 --> 02:27:15.730]
Oh, let me see, I've never seen those

[02:27:16.050 --> 02:27:17.070]
Here, touch it

[02:27:17.830 --> 02:27:18.790]
Put your finger in it

[02:27:18.790 --> 02:27:20.410]
There's a hole in the back, put your finger in it

[02:27:20.410 --> 02:27:21.750]
Turn it over and put your finger in there

[02:27:21.750 --> 02:27:25.230]
What does it do? It does stuff

[02:27:25.230 --> 02:27:27.590]
Look, wait, I gotta dial this thing up

[02:27:27.590 --> 02:27:29.390]
No, I don't even know where it comes up on this board

[02:27:29.910 --> 02:27:31.410]
Yeah, give it back to me eventually

[02:27:31.410 --> 02:27:33.430]
There we go, see

[02:27:34.310 --> 02:27:35.450]
Start, stop, stop

[02:27:35.450 --> 02:27:37.330]
It's like an 8-track tape, but different

[02:27:37.330 --> 02:27:38.870]
8-track tape, I know

[02:27:40.430 --> 02:27:42.650]
So I don't even know what, so we have to put drops in it

[02:27:42.650 --> 02:27:45.150]
So that's why I have an 8-track tape, I know

[02:27:45.570 --> 02:27:47.590]
So you work hard to not have an accent

[02:27:47.590 --> 02:27:48.770]
Yes, but I can't get rid of it

[02:27:48.770 --> 02:27:50.350]
You go to therapy? No, why?

[02:27:50.510 --> 02:27:51.870]
You got to like, speech therapy? No

[02:27:51.870 --> 02:27:53.170]
Like, one email test? No

[02:27:53.170 --> 02:27:56.370]
You know, one email to therapy? Oh, did you know? No, I didn't

[02:27:56.370 --> 02:27:59.810]
He did, he's a very nice guy but he sounds like almost fun

[02:27:59.810 --> 02:28:01.190]
Oh, that's a scene

[02:28:01.190 --> 02:28:02.830]
But he sounds like a mole

[02:28:02.830 --> 02:28:04.710]
No, he's muscles everywhere

[02:28:04.710 --> 02:28:05.830]
Totally, but not like Timmy

[02:28:05.830 --> 02:28:07.870]
No, Tim is ridiculous

[02:28:08.570 --> 02:28:09.670]
He's speech-how

[02:28:09.670 --> 02:28:13.690]
Different methods, different methods of muscle building

[02:28:13.690 --> 02:28:14.430]
Be careful

[02:28:15.030 --> 02:28:18.830]
Careful, Neil says that that's an f-word in Mexican Spanish

[02:28:18.830 --> 02:28:19.770]
Yes, it is

[02:28:19.770 --> 02:28:22.770]
Yeah, that means nothing to mean

[02:28:22.770 --> 02:28:25.870]
Or a Cuban, like we can't get into the whole

[02:28:27.210 --> 02:28:28.890]
What it means in one language

[02:28:28.890 --> 02:28:31.230]
What it means in another language, because excuse me

[02:28:31.770 --> 02:28:33.410]
You know, I'm still going to say papaya

[02:28:33.410 --> 02:28:35.730]
Because that's what you call it in Gringoville

[02:28:35.730 --> 02:28:37.650]
Yes, you do, you do say papaya like that

[02:28:37.650 --> 02:28:38.290]
What is that? That's a phrase

[02:28:38.890 --> 02:28:40.270]
Are you crazy? I have thighs

[02:28:41.370 --> 02:28:42.630]
Rollies? Show them

[02:28:42.630 --> 02:28:44.590]
You have thighs? I have thighs

[02:28:45.710 --> 02:28:46.890]
Inquiring minds, one and a

[02:28:46.890 --> 02:28:49.030]
Whenever I see like, flung or desserts

[02:28:49.030 --> 02:28:50.690]
Yeah, my thighs get hungry

[02:28:50.690 --> 02:28:53.330]
I, ha, ha, ha

[02:28:54.110 --> 02:28:56.570]
What a drop, that's going to make baby

[02:28:56.570 --> 02:28:58.110]
So we got to do a break, alright?

[02:28:58.110 --> 02:28:59.790]
You got to go ahead, cause I had nothing, what?

[02:29:00.210 --> 02:29:01.770]
What time is it? 127

[02:29:02.590 --> 02:29:03.230]
Alright, we're done

[02:29:26.230 --> 02:29:26.550]
I'm 5'60", WQAM

[02:29:26.570 --> 02:29:29.830]
All I want to do is rub my fat belly on you

[02:29:30.270 --> 02:29:34.910]
That's right pal, I'm going to spread olive oil on my fat belly and rub it all over you

[02:29:34.910 --> 02:29:38.590]
Then, if you don't shut your big mouth

[02:29:39.130 --> 02:29:40.850]
I'm going to put some halabah down here

[02:29:40.850 --> 02:29:42.570]
And then I'm going to marvel, I sure

[02:29:42.570 --> 02:29:43.910]
What do you think about that?

[02:29:44.330 --> 02:29:45.310]
You moaks

[02:29:45.310 --> 02:29:48.890]
I just, I just hope you still think I'm pretty

[02:29:49.510 --> 02:29:50.410]
Talked about it yesterday

[02:29:50.410 --> 02:29:53.210]
But what does that have to do with Ike fan? I'll loose you loaf as a Cuban that can't swim

[02:29:53.210 --> 02:29:55.110]
You know Cuba? It's surrounded by water

[02:29:55.110 --> 02:29:56.570]
I know but I don't know how to swim

[02:29:56.570 --> 02:29:58.190]
Get out as a swim

[02:29:58.610 --> 02:30:00.610]
I know how to swim like underwater

[02:30:00.610 --> 02:30:04.210]
But like, like with your arms and going to be a pig

[02:30:04.210 --> 02:30:06.210]
So you've got a paddle, can you dog paddle at least?

[02:30:06.310 --> 02:30:08.490]
Yeah, so if we threw you in the water you wouldn't, you know

[02:30:08.490 --> 02:30:12.230]
I would survive, I would like get tired after like 5 seconds

[02:30:12.230 --> 02:30:14.510]
So you have a swimming class today and that's why you're not going skating

[02:30:14.510 --> 02:30:17.210]
Yeah, but it's really, it's fun, it's really fun

[02:30:17.210 --> 02:30:19.150]
You will go, cause you mentioned freestyle and I said freestyle

[02:30:19.150 --> 02:30:21.570]
That's what I'm going to be hearing tonight, cause who, what's the name of the song?

[02:30:21.730 --> 02:30:22.030]
I don't know

[02:30:22.030 --> 02:30:26.090]
Where the artist goes, uno, do it, re, quadro

[02:30:26.630 --> 02:30:27.510]
What's the thing, Zach?

[02:30:27.750 --> 02:30:30.190]
I don't know, it's not Trio, that's not da da da is it

[02:30:31.010 --> 02:30:31.730]
I don't know

[02:30:31.730 --> 02:30:34.070]
I don't know, well we got that

[02:30:35.290 --> 02:30:37.410]
Ike fan, I'd loose you loaf as doesn't know how to swim

[02:30:37.410 --> 02:30:41.570]
What are we going to do? You know, I was embarrassed because I had to take swimming lessons when I was a little kid

[02:30:41.570 --> 02:30:44.310]
But I guess at least that's when you're supposed to be taking swimming lessons

[02:30:44.310 --> 02:30:47.210]
No, this is da da da, I don't know, this is not that song

[02:30:47.210 --> 02:30:50.030]
No, that's not uno, I don't know

[02:30:50.550 --> 02:30:51.350]
What are you doing?

[02:30:51.670 --> 02:30:54.710]
Playing several things at the same time, you don't know how many players up, I have open right here

[02:30:56.870 --> 02:30:58.450]
I know, it's hysterical

[02:30:59.190 --> 02:31:02.430]
Speaking of hysterical, what about my space drama?

[02:31:02.930 --> 02:31:03.670]
What it's one

[02:31:03.670 --> 02:31:05.790]
Oh my god, I have a phone bully

[02:31:06.230 --> 02:31:08.990]
Oh that, see, here's the thing, I gotta explain it to you

[02:31:08.990 --> 02:31:13.130]
I wouldn't like encourage these people, you don't understand that they're crazy lifeless stalkers

[02:31:13.130 --> 02:31:16.030]
They're for real, you know, it's funny for a little while

[02:31:16.030 --> 02:31:17.670]
But they don't go away ever

[02:31:18.370 --> 02:31:19.430]
He's like Psycho

[02:31:19.430 --> 02:31:21.190]
Yeah, we have a lot all of it

[02:31:21.190 --> 02:31:24.090]
Everybody has to just leave him alone and I'm like, but I can't help but I have to do it

[02:31:24.090 --> 02:31:28.050]
However many Psychos there are in this town, they're all listeners of this show

[02:31:28.050 --> 02:31:33.830]
And they have no life outside of this radio show or everything that this radio show touches

[02:31:33.830 --> 02:31:36.270]
Now that I'm touching you, I'm reaching out and touching you all over

[02:31:36.270 --> 02:31:39.930]
Now you are a part of the show and you are a part of these stalker's lives

[02:31:39.930 --> 02:31:40.610]
Oh no

[02:31:40.610 --> 02:31:43.430]
And you know what, for the longest time, it's kind of like their granny my request

[02:31:43.430 --> 02:31:45.610]
Because for the longest time I was asking them to stalk a female

[02:31:45.610 --> 02:31:49.870]
I'll say, hey you faggot, go find a female to stalk, you know, straight people stalk females

[02:31:49.870 --> 02:31:50.350]
Right

[02:31:51.090 --> 02:31:52.450]
I guess they listened to now

[02:31:52.450 --> 02:31:55.450]
And now they're stalking fake George, the rights of you

[02:31:55.450 --> 02:31:59.490]
Free, extra free, look at all these people on the phone, QIAM hello

[02:31:59.490 --> 02:32:04.010]
Hey, you're up there, the song you're talking about is numbers by crosswords

[02:32:04.010 --> 02:32:04.970]
Day number

[02:32:04.970 --> 02:32:06.650]
The crosswords

[02:32:06.650 --> 02:32:08.690]
I knew it

[02:32:08.690 --> 02:32:12.690]
Hey, I don't know what's going to make you, you know what it's going to

[02:32:12.690 --> 02:32:12.690]

[02:32:13.970 --> 02:32:15.710]
Galaxy and Davie

[02:32:15.710 --> 02:32:17.510]
But I'm here, here, here, here

[02:32:17.510 --> 02:32:22.990]
West of, wait, east of university south of Sterling north of Sheridan on Davie Road extension

[02:32:22.990 --> 02:32:24.670]
830-1130

[02:32:24.670 --> 02:32:25.730]
So what's the name of it?

[02:32:26.110 --> 02:32:26.510]
Galaxy

[02:32:27.470 --> 02:32:28.930]
Galaxy, cool man

[02:32:28.930 --> 02:32:32.190]
I wanted to clear a question, maybe Lucy can answer too

[02:32:32.190 --> 02:32:35.470]
How can we find a nice bisexual girl, you marry her?

[02:32:35.930 --> 02:32:37.510]
And then she doesn't like carpet anymore

[02:32:37.510 --> 02:32:40.010]
Because she did it to her best you can be any

[02:32:40.010 --> 02:32:41.190]
Right, that was a big lie, I can't take it

[02:32:41.190 --> 02:32:43.530]
There was a big lie, I can't believe you thought, did you fall for that?

[02:32:43.730 --> 02:32:45.230]
Yeah, that was just a trap you

[02:32:45.230 --> 02:32:46.210]
Did you fall for that?

[02:32:46.510 --> 02:32:48.390]
That's a trap, like I'm on the pill, is a trap

[02:32:48.390 --> 02:32:49.310]
Yeah, that's a total trap

[02:32:49.310 --> 02:32:52.030]
You know that's better than we can have next to beautiful women?

[02:32:52.850 --> 02:32:53.530]
No, what?

[02:32:53.530 --> 02:32:55.230]
We can have next to beautiful women

[02:32:55.230 --> 02:32:55.610]
You're right

[02:32:56.950 --> 02:32:57.490]
You're right

[02:32:57.490 --> 02:32:58.930]
I'm too jealous

[02:32:58.930 --> 02:33:00.310]
I know, I know, I know

[02:33:00.310 --> 02:33:01.890]
That's it, I can't do a lot

[02:33:01.890 --> 02:33:03.890]
And the humans go to the bisexual thing, do they?

[02:33:03.990 --> 02:33:05.770]
They're like either hardcore-talky, adults or nothing

[02:33:05.770 --> 02:33:07.190]
Yeah, either you are, you're not

[02:33:07.910 --> 02:33:10.890]
There's the type of girl who like after five shots at tequila

[02:33:10.890 --> 02:33:13.270]
And maybe a colacab from what will he

[02:33:13.270 --> 02:33:15.530]
I'm gonna make all my friends, I can make all my space

[02:33:15.530 --> 02:33:18.690]
Listen, for those pictures, I don't have to go look and find girls

[02:33:18.690 --> 02:33:20.930]
I found a couple

[02:33:21.470 --> 02:33:23.010]
I found that they love each other

[02:33:23.010 --> 02:33:26.330]
The girls I was out with, they have a special bond

[02:33:26.330 --> 02:33:28.130]
A really loving relationship

[02:33:28.130 --> 02:33:28.890]
Q-I-M, hello

[02:33:28.890 --> 02:33:29.970]
Hey, George, it's over

[02:33:29.970 --> 02:33:30.710]
You tell me?

[02:33:31.090 --> 02:33:34.230]
Hey, I give me, I bought Lucia, like my second time hearing her

[02:33:34.230 --> 02:33:35.610]
Give me some background about her

[02:33:35.610 --> 02:33:38.230]
She sounds like one of those girls that did that song in part 96

[02:33:38.230 --> 02:33:40.450]
No, it wasn't me, that wasn't me, thank god

[02:33:40.990 --> 02:33:42.630]
What's the, what's the, what's the, it's fine

[02:33:42.630 --> 02:33:43.910]
If any of the songs were strong and delicious

[02:33:44.590 --> 02:33:46.030]
Yeah, it would have to be limp on it

[02:33:46.030 --> 02:33:48.030]
No, no, no, I look nothing like that

[02:34:05.990 --> 02:34:09.790]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

[02:34:09.790 --> 02:34:39.770]
I'm going to be in the same room with her if she was one of those. No. No. They made me nuts. South Miami Cuban girls drove me nuts. I hated them. They hated me. I agreed about everything. I have nothing wrong with girls. I just like that. I incurred it, but I don't. I don't. Yeah. I'm not going to. I'll just loose the hell. She. I want to ask her. She's right here. Like, she's not in the room. I'm here. Can they actually hear me? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.

but I don't have that song.

[02:35:38.970 --> 02:35:41.330]
I have everything by craft work except for that.

[02:35:41.730 --> 02:35:43.670]
That is like from the late 70s.

[02:35:43.730 --> 02:35:46.230]
So those people were engineers, that type of sound.

[02:35:46.730 --> 02:35:48.130]
And that's all I've ever hear about that sound.

[02:35:48.190 --> 02:35:49.950]
Listen, obviously we never met that you're

[02:35:49.950 --> 02:35:52.030]

[02:35:52.030 --> 02:35:52.930]
before you were born.

[02:36:00.050 --> 02:36:04.030]
This is the music that computers to make music the first like.

[02:36:11.410 --> 02:36:14.690]
And then the story is new order hard.

[02:36:14.930 --> 02:36:17.390]
This is like whoa we need to start making some music.

[02:36:17.510 --> 02:36:20.570]
Africa bombauded the shoulder hook and acted like it was there.

[02:36:20.710 --> 02:36:22.090]
It didn't even be credit for it.

[02:36:22.150 --> 02:36:26.050]
You know for finite rock, shoulder hook, shoulder hook from

change your express.

[02:36:27.350 --> 02:36:29.270]
But this is not a great lyrics express.

[02:36:29.710 --> 02:36:30.630]
Music non-stop.

[02:36:30.910 --> 02:36:32.010]

Would you like to be a part of our radio show today?

[02:37:34.910 --> 02:37:36.770]
Are we confusing you with the crap for music?

[02:37:38.710 --> 02:37:40.470]
I think so

[02:37:42.770 --> 02:37:44.730]
I'm gonna hang up like this

[02:37:44.730 --> 02:37:46.130]
This is what we get

[02:38:02.190 --> 02:38:03.310]
I'm eating over table

[02:38:03.310 --> 02:38:05.510]
You and hello

[02:38:08.210 --> 02:38:11.670]

[02:38:42.970 --> 02:38:48.390]
Hello, that's a damn good thing. I got this music playing in the background. There'd be so much dead air strong with them. Hello

[02:38:50.730 --> 02:38:54.150]
That damn people don't seem to realize that when they call I

[02:38:54.730 --> 02:38:58.110]
Put them on hold so they start telling me their stuff. I put them on hold and they freak out

[02:38:58.110 --> 02:38:59.370]
Do you talk about that down?

[02:38:59.590 --> 02:39:03.730]
Look they know I'm team. They know the freaking routine. It's not rocket scientists

[02:39:04.970 --> 02:39:09.370]
Scientists they call they could put on hold the next voice they hear is the people on the air and they're on the air

[02:39:09.370 --> 02:39:15.610]
It's just it's way too complicated for them. What's the number here? 5 6 7 0 5 60 and we're down to two certificates left

[02:39:15.610 --> 02:39:16.630]
Oh, thank you

You crush my head with your thighs. Yes, I mean you can wear bottoms. Okay, all right?

[02:39:43.110 --> 02:39:47.730]

[02:42:30.850 --> 02:42:37.350]
Always bringing up songs that I don't have and I'm not being sarcastic because that gives me the opportunity to go and get it

[02:42:37.350 --> 02:42:42.450]
At that point because I do want my collection to be complete first of all in the most recent order of business

[02:42:49.030 --> 02:42:49.550]

[02:46:20.910 --> 02:46:24.450]
It's not that a blind man can't play heavy metal. It's just that they didn't at that time

[02:46:25.030 --> 02:46:29.710]

6.256 the Q.A.M

[02:47:08.110 --> 02:47:11.730]
It's an in particular a group that had been outspoken and critical of the administration

[02:47:11.730 --> 02:47:18.910]
These broads are millionaires lionized on TV. I've never seen people enjoying their husbands death so much

[02:47:18.910 --> 02:47:21.630]
Yeah, and culture so big

[02:47:21.630 --> 02:47:24.390]
She is full of hate

[02:47:25.390 --> 02:47:31.510]
Makes everybody angry gets the liberals all worked up

[02:47:31.510 --> 02:47:34.570]
Worship by the Fox News game

[02:47:34.570 --> 02:47:36.390]
The cops just want downtown

[02:47:36.990 --> 02:47:39.730]
But she ever ended up me

[02:47:40.590 --> 02:47:42.590]
No one would care at all

[02:47:43.630 --> 02:47:49.070]
You could be a widow you could be a priest

[02:47:49.790 --> 02:47:51.330]
You know that's a

[02:47:51.330 --> 02:47:54.970]
Tiger if you ever disagree

[02:47:56.030 --> 02:48:00.910]
Wonder what she's playing again by dropping her bones

[02:48:01.910 --> 02:48:05.870]
She supports our soldiers by acting

[02:48:05.870 --> 02:48:11.470]
Can you make her go away?

[02:48:12.410 --> 02:48:14.270]
Can we break your skinny legs?

[02:48:15.510 --> 02:48:17.270]
We wish each other face

[02:48:18.390 --> 02:48:20.590]
But a pocket in the way

[02:48:21.210 --> 02:48:23.510]
Is she a woman anyway?

[02:48:24.890 --> 02:48:27.590]
One thing we shark you day and

[02:48:28.170 --> 02:48:28.770]
Don't just

[02:48:30.150 --> 02:48:31.790]
Scrapes and talk to

[02:48:33.290 --> 02:48:37.930]
Because they hear to speak out to speak out using the fact that they're widows

[02:48:37.930 --> 02:48:40.190]
How about sending in somebody we're allowed to respond to?

[02:48:40.330 --> 02:48:44.050]
No, no, no, we always have to respond to someone who just had a family member dog

[02:48:44.050 --> 02:48:45.710]
I say that because they don't leave it all the story

[02:48:45.710 --> 02:48:47.570]
No, you're questioning their offenses

[02:48:47.570 --> 02:48:50.830]
They were using their belief in order to make a political point

[02:48:50.830 --> 02:48:54.370]
These broads, you know, are millionaires thought by people?

[02:48:54.930 --> 02:48:58.110]
I've never seen people enjoying their husbands death so much

[02:48:58.710 --> 02:49:02.090]
Yes, they're all over the new all over the new all right
