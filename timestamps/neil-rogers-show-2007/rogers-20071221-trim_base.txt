[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.140]
Why the earth you bastard?

[00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.660]
Tonight, a WC-43.

[00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.060]
Join your favorite radio sport holes on TV.

[00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.000]
It's the 560 Sport Hole Radio Christmas special.

[00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:15.820]
Go to hell!

[00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.480]
Go to hell!

[00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.320]
Drop dead of the history of safe ways.

[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.460]
Put her down to none.

[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.060]
How lazy fun!

[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:44.240]
Like splashes of bad manners in my life.

[00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.220]
Ho ho ho ho ho!

[00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.420]
The better check your mail, the better check it twice.

[00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.340]
Check it all day or check it all night.

[00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.100]
No checks will be coming in the mail.

[00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.940]
Go to hell!

[00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:29.520]
Go to hell!

[00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.920]
Go to hell!

[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:30.180]
Go to hell!

[00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.540]
Go to hell!

[00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:48.460]
Go to hell!

[00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:52.180]
Go to hell!

[00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.760]
Do you know what I mean?

[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:53.360]

[00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:55.740]
So today and Monday,

[00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:58.760]
the rest of the day said the better.

[00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:10.220]
At Christmas, there were things in other works that I can't talk about.

[00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.940]
But you never know.

[00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.080]
New year we might wind up someplace else.

[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.940]
In fact, our exit from here might be very soon and very expeditious.

[00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.720]
wouldn't that be a wonderful thing?

[00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.440]
OOOOO!

[00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:22.620]
So, less of the better.

[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:23.640]
Do you give that? I got it.

[00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:24.820]
Good. I said nothing.

[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.640]
Commissioner, yeah, I noticed you've been really quiet.

[00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.340]
Who was in there during the crossover?

[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.000]
I'm thinking you were yucking it up with.

[00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.740]
I'm thinking...

[00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.240]
We're trying to think. Who was it, Chris?

[00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.220]
Some female. Jen.

[00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:41.640]
Oh, Jen. Jen.

[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.040]
Yeah. We were exchanging presents.

[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.680]
She gave me a shirt.

[00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:45.280]
It was a sterical.

[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:47.160]
The shirt.

[00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:49.140]
I see.

[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:57.600]
Commissioner Robert McDallis says the FCC won't move forward on any pending indecency complaints until the US Supreme Court weighs in on the issue.

[00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.720]
McDallis says what happens is going to determine the course of action that this or other commissions take on the issue.

[00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:08.500]
And November the FCC asked the Supreme Court to overturn a ruling with struck down its fleeting expletive rule.

[00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:10.780]
Well,

[00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:13.220]
screw you with the FCC.

[00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.240]
Okay, you guys wouldn't know radio if they jam 400 of them up your collective arse.

[00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.260]
Here's the poll from yesterday.

[00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:21.960]
What drug gave you the best experience?

[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.540]
And we certainly are recommending drugs, although, you know, whatever you like to do, go ahead.

[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:27.700]
1018, 2018.

[00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.040]
Why do I say we aren't recommending drugs?

[00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.600]
We're working in this business and in this place, you need all the drugs you can get.

[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.240]
Alcohol 243.

[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.200]
Grash 240.

[00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:38.740]
Almost a dead heat.

[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.580]
Even Stephen.

[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.260]
I never used drugs of booze, 112.

[00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.460]
Potter cocaine 78.

[00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:45.920]
Quailude 61.

[00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.140]
They get really lured when you give them a quailude.

[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.180]
Let me tell you right now.

[00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:53.260]
LSD 57.

[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.500]
Exocc 53.

[00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:55.940]
How she's 51.

[00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.180]
Oh, today's the last day of Hodge, by the way.

[00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:59.400]
Well, good.

[00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.280]
Then let me forget to rip the egg.

[00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.120]
I'm going to admit about this.

[00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:05.520]
The Jesus Christ is that is.

[00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.740]
All right.

[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.360]
Oh, they're taking the Christ out of Christmas.

[00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.940]
I was reading some stupid article by some Jackass, some right-wing Jackass.

[00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.980]
Oh, you can't have Christmas without Christ.

[00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.960]
Well, guess what?

[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:22.720]
Well, sugar 39, morphine 24, crack 22, laughing gas 17, speed 11 and heroin 10.

[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.520]
Out of 2018, what we eventually did give 1000.

[00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.960]
I mean, you know, took all afternoon, but I don't know about today, though, Chris.

[00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:30.940]
I think 900 would be a nice goal again.

[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:31.960]
Stop good to me.

[00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.760]
What was the goal yesterday?

[00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.380]
800?

[00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:40.700]
Oh, nine, I think eight nine eight eight eight.

[00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.060]
So 12 on a pool today so far.

[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.840]
It's going to take a long time to read it.

[00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:45.840]
Anyway, we're going to get into that.

[00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:51.920]
This business about the taking the Christy Christmas has become a cultural holiday.

[00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:59.140]
For some people, it's a religious holiday, but in a more generic sense, it's become a cultural holiday.

[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:04.760]
So that everybody, even if they're not Christians, who don't believe in all that crap, they can celebrate it.

[00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.560]
They can exchange gifts and have fun into whatever they own, and part of the culture of it.

[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:09.500]
Right?

[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:10.680]
Go to Christmas parties.

[00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:11.440]
Shrooms around.

[00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:12.020]
Right. Right.

[00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:18.800]
So when the far-bison, when the religionist, the Jesus Christers, is world-of-the-all calls,

[00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:23.300]
then want to keep injecting, sticking Jesus in the face of those of us who don't believe in Jesus,

[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:24.980]
that's what it becomes offensive.

[00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:31.260]
And this is the thing about the religionist and the God Squad that just really frosts my fat old nasty smelly ass,

[00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.500]
and that is that you people don't understand.

[00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:37.800]
That just plain common decency dictates if you want to believe in something,

[00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:39.420]
and you and your family want to celebrate it, whatever.

[00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:40.820]
Go ahead, have a good time.

[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:42.760]
Leave the other people alone.

[00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:45.180]
Don't use your religion as a weapon.

[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.960]
Of course, that's what's going on in the whole world, and always has and always will.

[00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:48.560]
That's a weapon.

[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.420]
Oh, don't take Jesus and the activity seen out of Christmas.

[00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:54.020]
Why not?

[00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.880]
Why can't we just have, you know, I mean, you do your thing in your house,

[00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.800]
and don't put it out in the front yard, by the way.

[00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:03.880]
I got crazy religious people living in my neighborhood there in plantation,

[00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:05.400]
and they really pissed me off.

[00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:11.240]
But anyway, what celebrity death of 2007 was the saddest to you?

[00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:13.320]
And look at that.

[00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:17.600]
One more heartless at this time of the year, goodwill on earth and peace on man, man.

[00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:22.380]
We have 621 vote, but none of these 162.

[00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:26.900]
Couldn't you find an at length he lists there's somebody that you were disturbed croaking?

[00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:28.880]
I voted for somebody.

[00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:29.880]
Yeah, I did too.

[00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:32.740]
I probably had a father dry, and he only had the two vote.

[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:34.560]
Me and one other.

[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.400]
One other astute person.

[00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:37.680]
He was a great guy.

[00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:38.280]
Great priest.

[00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:39.500]
Great liberal.

[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:40.460]
A liberal priest.

[00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:41.260]
Oh my God.

[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.800]
I don't think he even molested any altar boys that I know of.

[00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:44.120]
Right.

[00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:49.000]
None of these 162, Molly Ivan 75, Kurt Honigue, Jr. 41.

[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.940]
Luciano Pavrote 36.

[00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:51.600]
How's that?

[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:52.440]
Why?

[00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:57.840]
Evil, con Evil 33, Dan Fogelberg 27, and Nicole Smith 26.

[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.420]
Mr. Wipple 22, actually I prefer her son better.

[00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:04.220]
We didn't put him on there though.

[00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:05.120]
I don't know what his name was.

[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:06.540]
Dan, Danny, we forgot.

[00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:09.620]
Mr. Wipple 22, Tammy Fei, Mr. 20.

[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.720]
Phil Resudo, the scooter 17.

[00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:14.840]
Merve Griffin 17.

[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:16.560]
Hey, Merve, you fairly.

[00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:18.420]
I guess it's too late for him to come out now.

[00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:21.460]
Brad Delp 14.

[00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:23.220]
He was the lead singer of Austin.

[00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:25.680]
I grew old up before to show this morning committed suicide.

[00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:28.640]
And if you listen to their music, you'll understand easily why.

[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:29.840]
Boston was good.

[00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:32.920]
More than a feeling.

[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:34.200]
That was one of their songs.

[00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:35.940]
It wasn't a problem with their music.

[00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:38.280]
It was the problem with the stations that played them into the ground.

[00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:38.980]
It was the ground.

[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:39.780]
There's no question.

[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:40.920]
No question.

[00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:42.300]
Oh, they just killed us with it.

[00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:42.440]
Yep.

[00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:43.940]
Charles Nelson Riley 12.

[00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:49.680]
He vined to Carlo 12, Robert Goulet 12, Art Buckwall 12, Bill Walsh 11.

[00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:54.560]
Norman Mealer 8, Brett Summers 6.

[00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:57.860]
What a nasty Emmy who knows.

[00:07:57.980 --> 00:07:59.660]
Maybe she was very nice and very sweet.

[00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:00.360]
I doubt it though.

[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.200]
I turn her 6, Reverend Jerry Falwell 6, Dave Halberstam 6, Wally Shura 5.

[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:09.540]
Four's Yeltsin 5, Dennis Johnson 5.

[00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:11.380]
Who the hell's Dennis Johnson?

[00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:13.220]
I don't know.

[00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:15.080]
Was he one of the beat-

[00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:15.560]
Exelting?

[00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:16.280]
Huh?

[00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:17.300]
Exelting?

[00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:21.020]
Goulet.

[00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:22.260]
Goulet.

[00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:28.340]
Franky Lane 4, Max Roach 4, Marcel Marso 3, Hank Bauer 2.

[00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:34.040]
Lady Bird Johnson 2, Beverly Sills 2, the Reverend Robert Dryan 1 and only 2.

[00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:35.720]
God, he was a great guy.

[00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:42.540]
Tom Johnson 1, Pound Paul Sullivan 1, Madeleine Angle, Lane Goulet, I don't know who that is 1.

[00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:43.160]
Langle?

[00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:46.160]
The other hand is the one.

[00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:49.880]
Tommy Makeham 1, Eddie Robinson 1.

[00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:51.460]
Did you ever see Tommy Makeham?

[00:08:53.060 --> 00:09:00.740]
The Arthur Schlesinger Jr. 1 and none for Betty Hutton, Harold Madison Jr., Mr. Butch, Ray Ann

[00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:05.200]
Dunlund, Bradford Washburner James Kelly, I was 6-2 on those last few people.

[00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:09.440]
Betty Hutton I knew and now she's dead.

[00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:14.180]
I have to be really old, really old and moldy like me, remember Betty Hutton.

[00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:21.840]
Dennis Johnson, nicknamed DJ, was an American professional basketball player for the Seattle Superconics, Phoenix Suns and Boston Celtics.

[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.140]
He's dead, died February 22nd, 2007.

[00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:25.420]
Oh my goodness.

[00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:26.560]
Oh my god.

[00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:28.580]
Wow, so that's the one and basketball player.

[00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:29.500]
I don't know who that was.

[00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:34.560]
Lisa, a food and other game last night, boy, let's get some hockey talk on it.

[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:34.700]
No.

[00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:36.520]
Not, they really suck, man.

[00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:37.920]
They just tear my kish-kish-ish out.

[00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:41.120]
It's that twa Friday, you bastards.

[00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:18.440]
And for Mr. Arkalli, I hired the Olsen twins.

[00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:24.380]
On Broca of Fishing Pole, and a nutless fruitcake.

[00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:30.200]
Hope Jason Giamby likes my steroid-free protein shake.

[00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:36.020]
I got a dad through the courts, sent to Lindsay Lawin.

[00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:38.820]
What's got Peter's been some shorts?

[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.480]
Cause hell is where he's goin'.

[00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:48.980]
I bought lots of scimpy clothes for the desperate housewife.

[00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:54.920]
I hope OJ loves my gift of free sharpkins soon night.

[00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.720]
What jam in a nipple ring?

[00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:00.580]
Got star Jones a real man.

[00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:07.560]
Torn ashly sims into sing and a cold kid men are tan.

[00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:09.720]
10, 15 to 5, 60 W to QM.

[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.060]
Happy holidays from all your friends.

[00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:12.780]
There's nothing wrong with saying happy holidays.

[00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:13.600]
It covers it all.

[00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:17.920]
All these far-bisoned play-a-man, all these crazy people.

[00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:18.540]
What?

[00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:21.420]
You will acknowledge our God or will kill it.

[00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:24.460]
This fox-crowed man is the John Gibson Billorani crab.

[00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:26.120]
Oh, they're taking Christmas away.

[00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:27.720]
The anti-Christian crowd.

[00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:28.300]
Yeah, right.

[00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:30.100]
Leave everybody alone.

[00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:34.400]
Go celebrate the roast spin your dreidel and stick your baby Jesus

[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:35.360]
where the moon known shine.

[00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:36.780]
And leave everybody else alone.

[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:38.540]
Okay, to drink some eggnog and get drunk.

[00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:41.200]
And have a good time and give some gifts and whatever.

[00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:41.900]
Right?

[00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:42.800]
Right.

[00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:43.860]
Keep it simple, baby.

[00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:44.860]
Keep it simple.

[00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:51.000]
A former dolphins chaplain is the subject of velocity against the arse d'isies of Miami

[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000]
with allegations that he sexually abused a one-time altar boy.

[00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:56.060]
Oh my God.

[00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:58.520]
The abuse began former dolphins chaplain.

[00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:03.000]
The abuse began in 1977 when the boy was 13 according to the lawsuit which was five

[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.340]
of the date circuit court yesterday.

[00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:08.680]
The priest took him to the dolphin games and introducing the players and also the coach

[00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:10.300]
Don Chulas house for a tea.

[00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:13.740]
What kind of a 13-year-old kid drinks tea?

[00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:18.080]
The players and coach didn't know the boy was being sexually abused.

[00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:18.940]
The lawsuit stated.

[00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:21.200]
The players and brainstorm.

[00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:24.840]
The abuse went on for five years when the priest took the boy to off-scale restaurants,

[00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:28.240]
gave him booze, and took him on overnight trips to the Florida Keys and North...

[00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:29.080]
Carolina.

[00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:34.020]
The priest was identified as Donald Walker, who at the time officiated at St. James'

[00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:34.800]
Catholic Church.

[00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:39.000]
Walker was transferred to a Persian napal's after the boy's mother learned the abuse

[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.640]
to the lawsuit like, oh boy.

[00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:43.580]
They may not be good, but at least they're consistent to church.

[00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:44.880]
They just keep shuffling them around.

[00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:46.460]
Oh, we got some problems over here.

[00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:47.500]
He's diddling some boys.

[00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:49.880]
So set him over there to diddles some boys and napals.

[00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:54.360]
He's now a retired priest who lives in Venice, Florida and runs a nonprofit called the Daily

[00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:55.640]
Walk Ministries Napoles.

[00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.780]
The Archdiocese of Miami is through the statement about the allegations.

[00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:02.900]
The Archdiocese takes any allegations seriously and has stated our policy we report the

[00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:04.840]
allegations to the Audi Audi this set.

[00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:10.280]
The lawsuit filed by Herman and Murmelsstein is asking for $10 million compensation.

[00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:14.060]
So when you go this Christmas holiday, all you Catholics out there in South Florida,

[00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:17.440]
when you go to church and put your money in the basket, just stick a Tisca to the basket,

[00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:21.460]
let's put some pedophile repellent money in the basket.

[00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:23.480]
That's what it's all about.

[00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:26.140]
You keep paying your money so you can pay off all these grotesque lawsuits.

[00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:29.640]
I bet you a lot of people are going to call in and they wish his happy holidays.

[00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:30.200]
You want a bet?

[00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:31.500]
No, don't go to the QAN, hello.

[00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:34.020]
Hello?

[00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:34.800]
Yes.

[00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:35.820]
Hi.

[00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:37.800]
Could you please...

[00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:41.840]
Could I please speak to somebody that might know where this package could possibly be?

[00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:44.680]
What are you talking about, his package?

[00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:47.580]
Yeah.

[00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:49.980]
Where his package could be?

[00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:51.440]
In the end we'll get a search party.

[00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:52.440]
Who's the QAN?

[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:53.000]

[00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:54.300]
Hey, Neil, how you doing?

[00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:55.140]
Okay, sir.

[00:13:55.900 --> 00:14:02.680]
Yeah, I mean, how's the Christians like to do, a Jewish person came up to them,

[00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:04.040]
is that happy Hanukkah?

[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:10.040]
Yeah, I mean, you see, nobody that I know of says that America is a Jewish country,

[00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:14.200]
but there are a lot of entitlement A-holes who run around all over the America's

[00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:17.540]
or Christian country like Ann Kolder for example, man Kolder.

[00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:18.380]
Yeah, like you.

[00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:18.900]
Like you, the Christian.

[00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:22.620]
America is just bored and they want something to complain about, that's it.

[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.380]
Everybody, everybody, that's how folks.

[00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:28.560]
See what I'm saying?

[00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:29.140]
Oh, I know.

[00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:31.220]
I'm going to complain a lot of stuff today and Monday, you'll see.

[00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:31.680]
All right.

[00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:35.180]
In fact, if I was smart I would have just launched right into it now,

[00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:36.320]
but why do I want to do that?

[00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:42.220]
Because I know a lot of people want to share their best for the holidays

[00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:44.740]
and so far I think we have their best for most first couple.

[00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:46.100]
That was their best.

[00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:47.180]
W-D-Q-A-M, hello.

[00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:48.840]
Yeah, look morning.

[00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:49.920]
I can't drink to me, please.

[00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:51.540]
Right?

[00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:53.380]
Yes?

[00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:55.840]
Yeah, look morning.

[00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:56.860]
Good morning.

[00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:57.800]
Oh, you're chronic.

[00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:58.380]
Get out of here.

[00:14:58.440 --> 00:14:59.720]
You make me sick with a bad voice.

[00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:00.220]
You're annoying.

[00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:04.260]
See, one thing on this show, and that's one of the reasons I've survived all these years

[00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:06.640]
in spite of these bad truths, I don't believe in chronic.

[00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:07.920]
Nobody wants to hear chronic.

[00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:09.960]
I'm a sport chosen and elsewhere.

[00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:12.560]
It's like, oh, hey, here's somebody we know.

[00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:14.280]
Nobody wants to hear those people.

[00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:18.500]
There should only be one celebrity on a talk show and that's the host.

[00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:20.380]
And maybe, you know, maybe the little George.

[00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:21.540]
Every now and then.

[00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:21.560]
Huh?

[00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:22.400]
Yeah.

[00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:24.960]
You're, I don't know what your story is.

[00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:25.860]
It's a good thing you're on vacation.

[00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:26.220]
I know.

[00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:27.460]
I'm already on vacation.

[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:28.800]
You're bad.

[00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:30.440]
You're really in bad shape.

[00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:30.660]
Uh-huh.

[00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:33.240]
Everybody say a prayer for George during the holidays, okay?

[00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:35.340]
I don't think he's going to survive it.

[00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:36.300]
What are you so worried about?

[00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:36.800]
Huh?

[00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:37.380]
Nothing.

[00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:43.420]
Is something we can help you with?

[00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:44.880]
Uh, no, money.

[00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:46.820]
Oh, here we go.

[00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:47.440]
It's money again.

[00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:50.040]
Oh, I'm going to kill myself right here on the earth.

[00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:52.020]
Hey, you asked money.

[00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:53.280]
I'm fine.

[00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:54.380]
Everything's fine.

[00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:56.360]
Where are some money from chicken neck?

[00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:56.860]
Oh, yeah.

[00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:58.380]
He's like, 30 Q.A.M.

[00:15:58.500 --> 00:15:58.620]
Hello.

[00:15:59.280 --> 00:15:59.660]
New.

[00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:00.420]
Yes.

[00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:02.740]
Could you help a little bit?

[00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:03.360]
I want to buy it.

[00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:04.720]
WQ.A.M.

[00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:04.960]
Hello.

[00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:06.040]
Hey, Neil.

[00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:06.820]
Good morning.

[00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:07.100]

[00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:07.740]
Good morning.

[00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:09.260]
I'm not going to say happy holidays.

[00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:12.240]
What are you doing?

[00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:13.400]
How about that?

[00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:16.720]
Well, because I know you'll never mind.

[00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:18.520]
Hey, I want to let you know.

[00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:23.460]
If you really want an animal, because you said on Monday that your victory lived up to let you have animals,

[00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:26.600]
you can go to your doctor and get a note.

[00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:29.060]
And the doctor will say that you need to have an animal.

[00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:31.980]
No, you learned some plain and you couldn't have one.

[00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:37.380]
I was just stating a fact that I'm not allowed to have animals in the building.

[00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:39.940]
Because Ellie Breffer was bugging me, do I have a dog?

[00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:43.280]
Well, if you really want one, you can have one.

[00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:44.000]
Let me see it again.

[00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:45.540]
I don't want a dog.

[00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:46.880]
I don't want a perikete.

[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:47.380]
I don't want a cockatoo.

[00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:49.380]
I don't want a orangutan.

[00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:50.660]
Get out of here.

[00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:51.360]
Go away, lady.

[00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:54.480]
You can get a doctor's note saying you have to have a...

[00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:55.280]
I got news for you.

[00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:56.320]
You get 50 doctors notes.

[00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:57.780]
They're not allowed to know pets in this building.

[00:16:57.960 --> 00:16:59.860]
They don't want no dog poop all over the place.

[00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:01.160]
No dog poo.

[00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:04.520]
Is that like a Hispanic thing, poo?

[00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:05.940]
Are you kidding me?

[00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:07.420]
No, I'm not.

[00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:09.520]
Poo.

[00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:10.980]
Yeah.

[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.180]
I don't want to get too deeply into that.

[00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:16.460]
I don't even know what you're saying.

[00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:19.220]
First of all, we don't use that word to cut with yourself.

[00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:20.720]
You're Mexican bashing again.

[00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:22.240]
I don't want to go into it.

[00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:23.900]
Just talk about risk for tend.

[00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:24.720]
I didn't say it.

[00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:25.720]
Just ignore it.

[00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:26.720]
We don't use that word.

[00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:28.060]
And she didn't call and ask about what I wanted to know.

[00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:29.920]
I don't know any Hispanics that use that word.

[00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:30.940]
If that's what you're asking.

[00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:31.760]
You want?

[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:32.900]
I don't know any Hispanics.

[00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:33.540]
What are they saying?

[00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:36.860]
What would his Spanish call fart?

[00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:38.000]
Is there a word for fart?

[00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:38.780]
Yeah, pale.

[00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:40.060]
Pale?

[00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:40.680]
Pale.

[00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:42.680]
Pale.

[00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:42.980]

[00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:44.360]
Maybe that's why I heard you in the elephant.

[00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:45.140]
Right, pale.

[00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:46.160]
The elephant fart song.

[00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:48.580]
Watch yourself now.

[00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:51.300]
We're trying to get this thing ironed out very elegantly here.

[00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:53.220]
W-D-Q-A-M, hello.

[00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:56.220]
Q-A-M.

[00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:56.780]
Q-A-M.

[00:17:58.960 --> 00:17:59.880]
W-D-Q-A-M, hello.

[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.940]
How long, Nioh?

[00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:03.220]
Yeah.

[00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:06.240]
What is fast-hanging flesh show on the air?

[00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:10.020]
What would you think it would be?

[00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:11.720]
I don't know.

[00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:12.300]
That's why I'm thinking.

[00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:14.300]
Last day of the year, December 31.

[00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:18.260]
And that's his last day on this station, that's correct.

[00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:18.900]
You know something?

[00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:21.880]
Our last day on this station might be that day too, as a matter of fact.

[00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:27.440]
Well, I'd love to have you and him together on the air one last time.

[00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:29.780]
Yeah.

[00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:34.480]
To come to this hotel memory lane.

[00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:35.980]
No, yeah, memory lane.

[00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:40.120]
Nobody wants to hear a couple of old fat Jews going down memory lane.

[00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:40.880]
Okay, just relax.

[00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:42.060]
That would be a good idea though.

[00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:45.960]
Last day of the year, maybe Hank and I can confabulate together.

[00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:48.100]
Do a little cross-over, cross-dress.

[00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:50.000]
Remember those days when we were doing the cross-over?

[00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:52.760]
W-D-Q-A-M, hello.

[00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:57.560]
I'm sure they want to wish you a happy Hanukkah and Niel, so at least allow me to, I think.

[00:18:58.200 --> 00:18:59.240]
Yeah, okay, over to all.

[00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:01.520]
That would be Q-A-M, hello.

[00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:06.240]
Q-A-L, how long I wish line, yes.

[00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:07.700]
They'll?

[00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:08.300]
Yes.

[00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:12.820]
I was just wondering, I know I know why these leads are going to get rid of you.

[00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:13.420]
Yeah.

[00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:16.020]
He brings out the best of all these haulers.

[00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:17.220]
What the hell was that with?

[00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:20.380]
The box you know it.

[00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:22.940]
Yeah, I hope not.

[00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:24.240]
Talk to you later.

[00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:26.560]
You should live so long, Schmuck.

[00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:32.700]
That's what always cracks me up is that people have absolutely nothing to say will call and it happens to Zidian times.

[00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:36.540]
And ripped the other haulers, I mean rightfully so, but who the hell are they to be ripping?

[00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:37.540]
They got nothing on material.

[00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:40.580]
That's their material is talking about how everybody else don't have any.

[00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:43.760]
Really, brilliance sir, very good.

[00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:45.240]
Ha ha ha ha ha.

[00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:50.460]
Which celebrity death of 2007 was saddest to you?

[00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:54.040]
I'm not going to read the list because none of these is kicking ass, 173.

[00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:56.700]
Of course when you add all the other ones together it beats that.

[00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:58.440]
How does 669?

[00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:01.040]
I don't know, I think maybe we got a shot at the 1000 today.

[00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:01.820]
I don't know.

[00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:03.240]
I mean there's nobody around.

[00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:05.300]
It's the Friday before Christmas man.

[00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:07.680]
This is the, is it today or tomorrow?

[00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:09.140]
That's the busiest shopping day of the year.

[00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:09.700]
I guess tomorrow.

[00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:12.160]
But today's got to be bright on the ass heels, isn't it?

[00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:17.620]
Did I mention I went to Woodbine yesterday for the quarter-slot guy, 116,900 bucks that I mentioned it by just did?

[00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:22.520]
I'm on a roll there, I think I'm going to just get out of here and go there and play, play the slots all day.

[00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:22.800]
Do it.

[00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:23.640]
Quarter-slots.

[00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:30.940]
Now I've played the dollar, a wheel of fortune again, and I've put in 100 bucks and I've played it for like almost an hour.

[00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:33.960]
Just kept, gave me 200 on the line and 150 on the wheel.

[00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:38.380]
Just kept me going and going and going and I got back to even and I got 1500 bucks on the line.

[00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:40.460]
How do you like that?

[00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:41.440]
Uh huh.

[00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:43.440]
I liked it.

[00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:48.220]
And it came and paid me off and I ran out of there like somebody had stuck a match under my ass.

[00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:50.060]
I flew out of that place.

[00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:50.780]
Good plan.

[00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:55.300]
And so I got $1,600 and somebody else's money, see a buy, buy buy.

[00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:57.700]
And I wasn't even playing the quarter-slot.

[00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:03.480]
You know what you said yesterday is so true that as time goes on.

[00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:07.500]
You know maybe one or two they disappear, they vanish for a while or whatever.

[00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:07.620]

[00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:10.980]
Now they're like the old rate influx of new A-holes.

[00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:13.420]
Sure, they're the other, they keep making more.

[00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:16.660]
Yeah, there's a factory where they went and doubt they stamp them out.

[00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:18.420]
What the biggest name?

[00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:19.760]
The best town ever.

[00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:20.520]
The most famous in the world.

[00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:22.040]
On the 80s, 20 to 5.

[00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:23.200]
60 QAM.

[00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:25.020]
The fourth leader.

[00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:27.140]
There you best, dude.

[00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:30.700]
Next, the malls with cards of credit.

[00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:34.500]
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la.

[00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:37.840]
Fizz the cease and again in dead.

[00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:41.860]
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la.

[00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:45.640]
At the mall with my friend, Darrell.

[00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:49.260]
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la.

[00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:52.900]
Parking wood, arizing hairwood.

[00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:56.140]
Riding with my word, weiss.

[00:21:56.620 --> 00:22:00.080]
Mile long lines and browning faces.

[00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:07.520]
Reed us both with verbal disgraces.

[00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:12.520]
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la.

[00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:14.980]
Shopping sure no pleasure.

[00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:22.500]
I must resort to drastic measures.

[00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:26.000]
La la la la la la la la la la la la.

[00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:28.160]
Get out of the way, kid.

[00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:29.440]
I can go all the way around here.

[00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:33.660]
Push the kid and cuss the cashier.

[00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:37.120]
La la la la la la la la la la la la la.

[00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:40.980]
After this I'll need a cold beer.

[00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:44.540]
La la la la la la la la la la la la la.

[00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:45.520]
Say it, Harold.

[00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:46.800]
I'll get a little grass.

[00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:49.060]
You'll make this any happier for me.

[00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:53.160]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

[00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:54.280]
Where were you in my age?

[00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:57.280]
All of a sudden Christmas is 19% revolving credit.

[00:22:57.640 --> 00:22:58.760]
And six months to pay it off.

[00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:01.080]
Hey, you, I saw that place.

[00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:04.340]
Hey, give it back right now before I shove my booties.

[00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:06.460]
Oh, I'm your low lives, I don't know.

[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.420]
Yeah, oh, ho, ho, to you too.

[00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:14.020]
Hey, miss, how can that possibly be out of stock?

[00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:18.140]
Do two people realize there's more than one customer who might want to buy it on special?

[00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:19.580]
Where's the manager?

[00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:21.260]
I'm the manager, you got a problem.

[00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:26.640]
Yeah, I only wish the happiest of holidays to you and your sir.

[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.160]
Hey, kids, come here, come here, come here.

[00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:29.700]
You'll be singing, okay, yeah, yeah.

[00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:34.500]
I gotta get out of here.

[00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:36.380]
Merry Christmas, yeah.

[00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:39.380]
Well, it's gonna be a long drive home.

[00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:42.480]
Happy generic holidays, everybody.

[00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:43.220]
1032.

[00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:45.260]
And guess who has got a card?

[00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:47.580]
Maybe an online card, I guess.

[00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:50.120]
I don't know what this is, but it's a picture of Johnny Dork.

[00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:53.500]
For the mustache and a big cowboy hat.

[00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:57.480]
Dressed up with a cowboy shirt just like the back-end and doodod days.

[00:23:57.600 --> 00:23:58.640]
Remember those days doodod?

[00:23:58.640 --> 00:23:58.980]
Sure.

[00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:02.560]
And it says, thank you so much for listening for the past six years.

[00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:04.820]
I've decided to take a break from radio for a while.

[00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:07.120]
So it's with mixed emotions that I tell you.

[00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:10.640]
I'll be leaving Kiss Country in my last day will be Sunday, December 23rd.

[00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:11.460]
Johnny Dork!

[00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:13.240]
The past six years have been so much fun.

[00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:16.700]
I've enjoyed talking with you on the phone, meeting you and playing your favorite songs.

[00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:18.920]
I'll still be dancing it round up.

[00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:25.200]
And maybe you'll hear me again sometime in the future, but for now it's goodbye.

[00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:27.600]
Once again, thanks for listening.

[00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:29.320]
I hope you have the best holidays ever.

[00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:30.560]
It writes Johnny Dork.

[00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:31.460]
Johnny Dork!

[00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:33.680]
Johnny Dork!

[00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:34.820]
Yeah, right.

[00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:36.740]
Put it in anyway.

[00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:39.080]
So there, I can't believe that picture.

[00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:41.860]
Wow, a mustache looks like an old coupe cowboy.

[00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:43.460]
Like a little hoop Gibson.

[00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:47.360]
Johnny's on his way out to the end of the year.

[00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:48.960]
They're going to know any of these stations.

[00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:50.580]
Everybody's on the way out the door.

[00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:55.220]
Like a log jam at the exit door.

[00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:57.320]
WQA-M, hello.

[00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:01.220]
Neil is a fondament still a priest.

[00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:04.020]
WQA-M, hello.

[00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:05.420]
Good morning.

[00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:06.160]
Yes, sir.

[00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:11.720]
This is a little probably untimely, but you heard the dogman call after the touchdown Monday.

[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.120]
The football game, the crazy call.

[00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:15.900]
No, I did not.

[00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:17.120]
Oh, you didn't hear it.

[00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:18.140]
Oh, but...

[00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:18.260]
What?

[00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:21.340]
It was they were screaming in yellow like lunatics.

[00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:22.520]
Yeah.

[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.480]
Keith Oberman had a great line when he played it.

[00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:26.040]
The highlight.

[00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:26.980]
He played their call.

[00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:32.620]
He goes, any resemblance between that call and the Hindenburg this after was purely coincidental.

[00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:33.260]
Right.

[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.240]
And his new book is coming out next Tuesday.

[00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:39.260]
You're still a fan of his or...

[00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:40.080]
Keith?

[00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:40.840]
Yeah.

[00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:44.180]
Yeah, I like the fact that he rips Vouchin' ass and he tells it like it is on the air,

[00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:47.220]
but as a person, I wish he would do something evil would happen to him.

[00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:48.420]
Yeah, I know you didn't like it.

[00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:49.360]
You did it with I miss this.

[00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:49.800]
That's correct.

[00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:50.660]
That is correct.

[00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:53.320]
But I still watch him every now and then though, but not like I used to.

[00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:56.860]
Yeah, his special comments for all those blab things is coming out Tuesday these days.

[00:25:56.860 --> 00:25:57.340]
Okay, great.

[00:25:57.500 --> 00:25:58.180]
We'll go by the book.

[00:25:58.680 --> 00:25:59.320]
WQAM, hello.

[00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:00.880]
Hi.

[00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:02.180]
I speak here, please.

[00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:02.800]
Speaking.

[00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:04.660]
Hey, Neil.

[00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:05.280]
Yeah.

[00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:07.160]
Hey, I have the holidays, brother.

[00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:08.440]
Back to you, sister.

[00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:12.000]
Hey, so what are you doing for the holidays?

[00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:14.480]
Going to Woodbuy and win some money.

[00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:19.260]
Yeah, I'm going to play the quarter slots.

[00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:20.920]
WQAM, hello.

[00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:22.820]
Hey, good morning, Neil.

[00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:23.500]
Good morning, sir.

[00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:23.860]
Yeah, hello.

[00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:25.740]
Yeah, I was looking at the poll.

[00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:29.580]
Didn't that jerk off Televangelis from Fort Lauderdale die, too?

[00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:30.700]
I can't believe he was handed it.

[00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:35.740]
Yeah, but the question is, which one of these people said, who's death sat in you the most?

[00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:37.420]
Why would anybody be sad about him?

[00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:38.480]
Nobody would be sad about him.

[00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:38.960]
Well, there you go.

[00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:39.940]
That's why he's not on the poll.

[00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:43.320]
There was another reverend who died and he was kind of the father of Televangelis.

[00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:44.320]
He was a great humbard.

[00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:44.980]
Remember that guy?

[00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:45.900]
He croaked, too?

[00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:47.400]
He's dead or is in the door now?

[00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:48.360]
I don't know that.

[00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:49.420]
What a great ear.

[00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:49.720]
Yeah.

[00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:52.420]
Jerry Falwell, D. James Kennedy and Rex Humbard.

[00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:53.420]
I'll write Rex Humbug.

[00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:54.000]
All right.

[00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:54.600]
Happy quenzo.

[00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:55.760]
Thanks for the good news.

[00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:57.200]
Happy Hodge.

[00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:00.620]
Remember, Gil Hodge's?

[00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:01.540]
Russ Hodge's.

[00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:02.840]
The Giants win the pennant.

[00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:04.540]
The Giants win the Russ Hodge's.

[00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:06.400]
Now maybe you got that call by a doubted.

[00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:08.800]
Now we don't want to hear the call.

[00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:09.860]
Well, what's wrong with you, Chris?

[00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:11.140]
You're sorry I got it ready to go.

[00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:14.320]
We don't want to, well go ahead.

[00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:15.140]
Go ahead.

[00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:18.080]
Thirty-six.

[00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:18.940]
Thirty-six, Charlotte.

[00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:20.760]
De Maria comes to us.

[00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:21.160]
De Maria comes to us.

[00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:22.060]
It's time for the formation.

[00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:24.420]
I'm in back to throw.

[00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:25.580]
Got time.

[00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:26.180]
Over the middle.

[00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:27.280]
De Maria's got it!

[00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:28.100]
Horting!

[00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:30.700]
He's back on the table!

[00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:31.380]
De Maria!

[00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:32.220]
Come on, De Maria!

[00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:34.160]
De Maria!

[00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:35.740]
De Maria!

[00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:36.580]

[00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:37.080]
De Maria!

[00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:37.560]
De Maria!

[00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:37.560]

[00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:39.780]
De Maria!

[00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:39.780]

[00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:47.680]
We're not going in for that one baby.

[00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:50.680]
A 64 yard pass completion.

[00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:53.220]
The Camarillo who...

[00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:57.140]
I love this Camarillo!

[00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:01.080]
The entire team is jump Camarillo in the end.

[00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:04.360]
So to see him white, let's wait a little bit to win it too.

[00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:09.160]
Still live over there.

[00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:09.760]
I'm not going in for that one baby.

[00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:09.760]

[00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:09.760]

[00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:09.760]

[00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:09.760]

[00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:10.980]
I'm still here.

[00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:13.380]
Soak it in.

[00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:15.180]
Why should I be surprised?

[00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:16.880]
Why should I be in a state of disbelief?

[00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:19.000]
The less said the better.

[00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:20.960]
Like I said, that was at the top of the show today.

[00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:22.860]
Today and Monday, the less said the better.

[00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:27.120]
Somebody please get us out of here.

[00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:29.220]
Please, please, I'm begging you.

[00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:33.140]
I'm begging for somebody to throw us a rope for the life raft to test to it.

[00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:33.980]
Please, please.

[00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:36.460]
WDQ-I-N, hello.

[00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:38.840]
Yeah, speak in the ill-please.

[00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:39.760]
Speaking, yes.

[00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:40.560]
Nail.

[00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:45.120]
I was just thinking back when you played those old details WGingles.

[00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:48.780]
You just played all the Gingles from New York.

[00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:51.440]
Radio has been demolished in the last one.

[00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:54.280]
You're K-L-W-U-M-T-S-O-N.

[00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:54.700]
Yeah.

[00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:55.580]
The best.

[00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:59.440]
They've just taken basically personal, they've made it corporate.

[00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:00.620]
That's right.

[00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:02.540]
Like they've done anything, Nail.

[00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:05.620]
They've taken the record industry, the whole business, they've demolished it.

[00:29:05.860 --> 00:29:08.920]
I mean, it's as bland as white bread.

[00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:10.620]
And I'll tell you one thing, my friend.

[00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:14.720]
You have been one of the shining stars in this business,

[00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:15.740]
and we're going to miss you.

[00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:17.000]
You are the tops, my man.

[00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:18.580]
What do you mean you're going to miss me?

[00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:20.920]
I'm not going to be on this station, but I'm not leaving.

[00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:24.040]
I hope the guys are still in the market, Nail, or at least national somewhere.

[00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:24.840]
I'll be on the market.

[00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:26.260]
Publix.

[00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:28.340]
See you, Pali.

[00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:29.800]
Thanks.

[00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:31.040]
I'll be around.

[00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:32.060]
Don't worry about that.

[00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:33.520]
I'm taking out a sandwich board.

[00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:35.840]
Nail Rajan is going to be on Yadi-Yah somewhere, you know.

[00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:37.840]
Hopefully very soon.

[00:29:40.060 --> 00:29:42.600]
I mean, who would have thought like two, three months ago,

[00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:45.920]
who would have thought that all of this would come to an ugly end like this?

[00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:46.260]
You know what I mean?

[00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:48.700]
Everything with them is always an ugly end.

[00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:51.680]
Never, never like a man, never like in a responsible, you know.

[00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:53.480]
Although maybe we're working on that.

[00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:53.920]
We'll see.

[00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:57.240]
Because there's one word that they give them.

[00:29:57.240 --> 00:29:59.960]
They just don't like the Haiti, you know what that word is?

[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.060]
Mm-hmm.

[00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:04.180]
Oh, they just don't like that.

[00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:05.640]
W-A-D-Q-A-M, hello.

[00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:06.740]
Hey, Nail.

[00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:07.500]
Yes, sir.

[00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:11.200]
Hey, Rafael, the cleanup, my car and I got grease all over it.

[00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:11.440]
Oh.

[00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:12.900]
W-A-D-Q-A-M, hello.

[00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:14.040]
Hey, Nail.

[00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:14.540]
Yeah.

[00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:17.880]
Earlier you were talking to that woman, you said you didn't want any animals.

[00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:21.000]
But I just heard you the other day saying you'd love a cop or two.

[00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:22.780]
Dump it.

[00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:27.780]
I would, but of course, I don't have the capacity to do that, but nevertheless.

[00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:32.900]
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

[00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:34.620]
Now must have been somebody knows Jolly Joe.

[00:30:35.380 --> 00:30:38.640]
He was about almost as funny as Jolly Joe, but not quite, but then again, who is?

[00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:40.500]
I got his name.

[00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:43.120]
The best talent here is the Logics.

[00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:45.440]
425.60Q-A-M.

[00:30:45.540 --> 00:30:47.140]
The fourth leader.

[00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:49.040]
A U-B-S-D.

[00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:52.080]
Rune off the red neck reindeer.

[00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:55.580]
He lives in a mobile home.

[00:30:56.200 --> 00:31:01.040]
He likes to kiss his sister underneath the mistletoe.

[00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:08.260]
He feeds up his kids at Walmart, and yes, he only has two teeth.

[00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:14.900]
He used all his empty, bare cans to decorate the Christmas tree.

[00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:21.440]
And then one drunk in Christmas Eve Santa came to the trailer park.

[00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:28.800]
Instead of giving kids their toys, they'd drink moonshine and the dog.

[00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:34.840]
And now we be hit and they've been a Santa's slave is up on blocks.

[00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:38.360]
Rune down the red neck reindeer.

[00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:41.420]
He collects wealth, bear and watch his cops.

[00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:46.000]
1044.16-11-560WQ-A.

[00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:50.040]
Who we left off the list and Chris is the one who needs to be beaten to a bloody pump because of this.

[00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:51.940]
Is that Sean Taylor?

[00:31:52.820 --> 00:31:53.080]
Ah.

[00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:55.340]
Now, you put that on there.

[00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:59.840]
We'll get 45,000 votes, because even people who never hurt a Sean Taylor were carrying on.

[00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:03.340]
This is the worst thing that could ever happen out here.

[00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:04.660]
Oh my god.

[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.000]
It was like that Britney nut.

[00:32:07.460 --> 00:32:07.820]
That guy.

[00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:10.140]
And how f***ing there?

[00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:11.260]
Anyone at the...

[00:32:11.260 --> 00:32:11.600]
That one.

[00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:12.440]
Right?

[00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:13.420]
Right.

[00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:15.400]
There was a lot of gnashing a teeth and carrying out.

[00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:17.520]
I mean, it was a tragedy and so on.

[00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:20.440]
Even the line never hurt him either, because I don't pay any attention to the redskins.

[00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:22.160]
They suck, especially Joe Gibbs.

[00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:29.600]
And then right after that, right after he got murdered, then the following weekend, Joe Gibbs did that stupid ass thing calling the second time out.

[00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:35.820]
And getting a 15-year penalty and giving a field goal to the opposing team wherever it was and giving the game away.

[00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:37.020]
Well, he was under a lot of stress.

[00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:37.640]
Oh, boy.

[00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:41.900]
And maybe, just maybe he didn't ask Jesus for help with that.

[00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:44.440]
And he's not alone as born again in Christian Creeps, Joe Gibbs.

[00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:47.560]
And guess who just died also?

[00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:48.160]
You'll never guess.

[00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:52.580]
He was the producer who helped build a major TV and movie studio, Frank Capra Jr.,

[00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:57.080]
whose father directed the Christmas Classics of Wonder Whole Life, his died he was 73.

[00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:03.240]
Capra died once in the United Hospital in Philadelphia after a long fight with prostate cancer.

[00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:07.960]
His screen credits include several major motion pictures including 28 days,

[00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:10.600]
the divine secrets of the Yaya sisterhood.

[00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:12.460]
Do you ever hear that?

[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:13.120]
Yes.

[00:33:13.580 --> 00:33:14.380]
I didn't.

[00:33:14.380 --> 00:33:14.640]
Right.

[00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:15.580]
And you see, what?

[00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:19.480]
I didn't work.

[00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:22.560]
The Master of Disturbance, Black Knight, and a walk to remember.

[00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:33.220]
He was also at the Hamlet Dawson's Creek, starring a then-unknown Katie Holmes film that studios and kept online with the studio sound stages full in recent years between movies and films.

[00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:35.700]
And he was filming another successful teenage soap, One Tree Hill.

[00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:41.700]
Capra Jr. said his father had no idea he was making the classic when filming It's a Wonderful Life.

[00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:49.980]
And I can understand why, because it's a very corny and very bad and overplayed movie with Jimmy Stewart, Donner Reed, and Lionel Barrymore.

[00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:52.740]
Oh my God, It's a Wonderful Life, My Aunt's.

[00:33:53.340 --> 00:34:00.980]
And of course, this tab of the year between that and Christmas heroes, they just jammed that down your throat over and over again.

[00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:01.880]
It's a Wonderful Life.

[00:34:02.220 --> 00:34:02.980]
Bad flick.

[00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:04.780]
W.A.M. Hello.

[00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:08.460]
Even D.Phone never had so much corn.

[00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:09.120]
Q.A.M.

[00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:10.800]
No deal.

[00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:11.500]
Yes.

[00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:17.160]
I was up and I'm person around with my windows down.

[00:34:17.660 --> 00:34:17.820]
Yeah.

[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:20.540]
Big Mac in my mouth.

[00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:21.400]
Yeah, okay.

[00:34:21.580 --> 00:34:25.640]
While Shubon and your Dome and the little camp it off perfect for the holidays.

[00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:26.560]
It'll camp it off.

[00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:28.880]
How we doing on Chris's pool?

[00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:30.020]
I think we got a shot today.

[00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:31.040]
7.16.

[00:34:31.860 --> 00:34:32.220]
Woo!

[00:34:33.700 --> 00:34:34.320]
Look out.

[00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:35.440]
We're going to be dangerous man.

[00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:36.180]
My, my, my.

[00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:36.900]
I look out now.

[00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:41.980]
I was just going to play bits today, but I think the way the phones are just smoking today with all these really good calls.

[00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:44.660]
Monday, that's all I'm doing, because it's Christmas Eve.

[00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:45.260]
Right.

[00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:47.100]
And you're going to be on vacation anyway.

[00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:50.940]
And they don't want, you know, and it's not that they don't want to, although they don't want to.

[00:34:51.580 --> 00:34:52.800]
But there's nobody around.

[00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:56.980]
Although I'm told that Zach is threatening to show up one or two days next week.

[00:34:57.800 --> 00:34:58.920]
And Cordis, I don't know.

[00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:00.780]
Well, you know, I only, how do you like that?

[00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:02.580]
I just got through sending him that thousand bucks.

[00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:04.700]
Wouldn't you think he'd go out of his way to help us out next week?

[00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:06.080]
Oh, we're talking about jump to it.

[00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:06.880]
Maybe he, yeah.

[00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:08.760]
Maybe he just hasn't been on high pants.

[00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:09.600]
Well, I'm grateful little bastard.

[00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:11.740]
He's, I think Brandon's got a good point about him.

[00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:13.100]
What, what?

[00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:15.020]
Oh, seriously, what's wrong with that kid?

[00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:15.460]
I don't know.

[00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:16.780]
Hope he shows up today.

[00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:17.600]
I got a, just like a dog.

[00:35:17.660 --> 00:35:17.980]
What?

[00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:20.080]
Got a Christmas present for him.

[00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:20.740]
Hope he shows up today.

[00:35:20.940 --> 00:35:21.620]
From, from you?

[00:35:22.060 --> 00:35:22.580]
From me.

[00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:23.640]
I get from there.

[00:35:23.740 --> 00:35:24.020]
For everybody.

[00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:25.500]
Isn't that sweet?

[00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:26.620]
Well, and what, what?

[00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:28.260]
Here you are, belly aching.

[00:35:28.340 --> 00:35:31.080]
You don't have any money, which I'm sure is true.

[00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:35.520]
And belly aching about, oh, I'm going to take care of you when I do my next deal.

[00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:35.780]
Right.

[00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:37.540]
And we're like a real radio station in your, right?

[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:39.420]
And all panicky and psychotic.

[00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:40.680]
And you keep buying presents.

[00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:41.460]
You just, yeah.

[00:35:41.660 --> 00:35:42.380]
That's, that's me.

[00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:43.540]
That's your nice guy.

[00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:44.140]
It's like me.

[00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:44.600]
Right.

[00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:45.380]
Just like me.

[00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:46.980]
Like who a fallin' other job.

[00:35:48.740 --> 00:35:54.100]
I mean, just to stay alive, just to stay afloat, I got to make at least $5,200, $600,000,000 a year.

[00:35:54.100 --> 00:35:55.780]
Just, just to keep everybody happy.

[00:35:55.940 --> 00:35:56.920]
That's on my human payroll.

[00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:00.500]
And I still just keep buying crap.

[00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:04.940]
Man, Rolex watches and stuff and furniture and you name it.

[00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:07.340]
Sky's the limit with me, because that's me.

[00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:09.080]
Santa Cal.

[00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:10.820]
WQAM.

[00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:11.100]
Hello.

[00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:13.500]
He told that gentleman to stick a big one.

[00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:15.060]
I got his, I'll just rip them.

[00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:16.500]
Yeah.

[00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:18.300]
And.

[00:36:20.060 --> 00:36:22.160]
Oh, this is a guy who's doing an narration on the show.

[00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:22.920]
Okay, thank you.

[00:36:23.780 --> 00:36:24.580]
WQAM, hello.

[00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:27.040]
He leaves me, G.I. alone.

[00:36:27.980 --> 00:36:28.800]
WQAM, hello.

[00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:33.060]
All I want for Christmas is Christmas for my fridge.

[00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:33.920]
Yeah.

[00:36:35.020 --> 00:36:36.000]
WQAM, hello.

[00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:36.760]
Yeah.

[00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:37.520]
Yes.

[00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:38.600]
Yeah.

[00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:39.540]
Yeah.

[00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:40.460]
Yeah.

[00:36:40.660 --> 00:36:40.820]
Yeah.

[00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:41.240]

[00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:41.960]

[00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:44.140]
How have you just relaxed?

[00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:45.840]
What was stopping you going into it now?

[00:36:46.260 --> 00:36:46.380]
What?

[00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:47.940]
Speaking their language, getting into it.

[00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:49.880]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:51.840]
We're doing screenless holiday talk.

[00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:54.940]
I don't think anybody has said to have a great holiday

[00:36:54.940 --> 00:36:58.340]
to you and all the audience and everybody else, all our good friends in South Florida.

[00:36:58.500 --> 00:36:58.660]
Right.

[00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:01.060]
And that's because everybody in South Florida pretty much hates each other.

[00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:02.120]
Like poison.

[00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:02.860]
BAH!

[00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:03.940]
BAH!

[00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:04.780]
Oh, it's a holiday.

[00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:05.440]
BAH!

[00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:06.440]
Like that.

[00:37:09.580 --> 00:37:12.400]
Although I will tell you again, we'll make you feel better about being there.

[00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:16.600]
The driving here is so much worse than it is there.

[00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:19.100]
You can't even begin to believe.

[00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:20.800]
I've heard stories, yes.

[00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:24.220]
The worst driver is a scared drive, right?

[00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:26.680]
And the people here are scared.

[00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:27.860]
They are slow.

[00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:32.020]
They are so slow that you just want to scream.

[00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:34.820]
You just want to carry on like a lunatic and roll down the window

[00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:36.940]
and just scream until your vocal box breaks.

[00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:40.160]
It's just, I've never seen anything like it.

[00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:41.300]
They just refuse to go.

[00:37:41.620 --> 00:37:41.620]

[00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:44.240]
Let me Qion, hello.

[00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:45.520]
Kion, BAH!

[00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:47.140]
Let me Qion, hello.

[00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:48.400]
Neil.

[00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:49.260]
Yes, sir.

[00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:50.300]
How are you doing?

[00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:50.940]

[00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:54.500]
Merry Christmas and happy Shakenenigo, whatever you celebrate.

[00:37:54.740 --> 00:37:55.160]
Right, yeah.

[00:37:55.380 --> 00:37:56.720]
I don't celebrate any of it.

[00:37:57.020 --> 00:37:58.300]
Okay, well that's probably a good thing.

[00:37:58.780 --> 00:38:00.700]
But I know you buy gifts for people and that's very nice.

[00:38:01.060 --> 00:38:01.520]
Yes, I do.

[00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:05.600]
As far as vocal bars, we know those step balls, beesies aren't paying them.

[00:38:06.100 --> 00:38:07.940]
But can we buy his CDs anywhere?

[00:38:08.620 --> 00:38:08.880]
No.

[00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:10.020]
No, you can't.

[00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:11.200]
You just got to listen to you.

[00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:12.120]
Yes, correct.

[00:38:12.580 --> 00:38:13.660]
And we'd love to listen to you, Neil.

[00:38:13.780 --> 00:38:14.080]
Keep it going.

[00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:14.640]
Okay, thanks.

[00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:15.420]
Have a happy sir.

[00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:16.080]
Okay enough.

[00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:16.760]
Enough of sucking.

[00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:20.020]
56670560, 0560.

[00:38:20.180 --> 00:38:22.720]
I can't believe we're getting a lot of calls today because I would have thought that the Friday

[00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:27.980]
before Christmas, I would have thought this would be because here yesterday, man, they were bailing

[00:38:27.980 --> 00:38:30.500]
out of town, out of town, their way to the airport like crazy.

[00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:34.020]
Everybody's zooming out of here.

[00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:34.960]
Well, of course, part of that.

[00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:36.980]
And maybe they'll be coming down there to see you guys.

[00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:38.220]
Yeah, then.

[00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:40.740]
Maybe much of frogs are going to be coming down there too.

[00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:42.040]
A bunch of y'all.

[00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:44.760]
The curse of the frogs, man.

[00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:46.420]
There's nothing worse than French Canadians.

[00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:47.780]
Let's do that pole again.

[00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:50.320]
Who are the worst bastards on the face of the earth?

[00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:55.740]
French Canadians are just a regular French as in from France in your pants.

[00:38:58.160 --> 00:38:59.820]
726 votes on our world famous pole.

[00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:01.960]
Now, how's, uh, did we put them on there?

[00:39:02.620 --> 00:39:03.060]
Yes, we did.

[00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:04.540]
Where is he?

[00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:06.040]
Sean Taylor's already got five votes.

[00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:06.660]
See, I told you.

[00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:08.080]
He's going to go zooming up there.

[00:39:08.180 --> 00:39:09.600]
Wouldn't surprise me if he wins the pole.

[00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:12.420]
W-Q-A-M, hello.

[00:39:12.420 --> 00:39:13.780]
Man, there's not the horse.

[00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:16.340]
Q-A-M, yes, sir.

[00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:18.080]
Hey, Neil, Merry Christmas.

[00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:18.940]
Back to you.

[00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:20.600]
Even to George too.

[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:21.840]
Yeah, even to George.

[00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:22.620]
Aw, thank you.

[00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:23.260]
Hard to say.

[00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:25.180]
Hey, that, I did want to take it.

[00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:26.640]
That was the first time I heard that call.

[00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:27.640]
That was pretty funny.

[00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:30.700]
Uh, with, uh, Mad Dog and...

[00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:32.120]
Yeah, it was, uh, something.

[00:39:32.860 --> 00:39:34.220]
Yeah, if you're a fan, it was funny.

[00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:36.120]
But anyway, uh, I just spoke to him.

[00:39:36.620 --> 00:39:40.200]
You, uh, I've been listening to you for a long time, Neil, and he brings me.

[00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:44.060]
There'd be sad ending for me because me and my dad, back...

[00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:48.260]
Back in the inquisitor general days when he was around, he listened to you.

[00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:50.520]
In between dies when we were out in the boat.

[00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:52.740]
It's going to be sad when you go.

[00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:55.940]
But I think when your contract runs off, you should probably just reach out.

[00:39:56.300 --> 00:39:56.300]

[00:39:58.820 --> 00:39:59.700]
Look at that was coming.

[00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:01.260]
W-Q-A-M, hello.

[00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:06.200]
Hey, how about playing some old, uh, Dan Ingram or, uh, cousin Brucey?

[00:40:06.860 --> 00:40:07.080]
Polly.

[00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:08.900]
Well, what does that mean?

[00:40:09.100 --> 00:40:10.880]
Some old Dan Ingram or, uh, cousin Brucey?

[00:40:10.940 --> 00:40:11.860]
Well, what does that mean?

[00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:14.000]
You know, some old clips you always play.

[00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:16.700]
I don't have any clips of Dan Ingram or, uh, cousin Brucey.

[00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:17.620]
What are you talking about?

[00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:18.420]
Sure you do, I've been doing this.

[00:40:18.420 --> 00:40:19.000]
No, I don't.

[00:40:19.380 --> 00:40:20.360]
No, I do not.

[00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:21.500]
Oh, come on.

[00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:22.380]
I know I got it.

[00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:24.180]
Oh, I thought you had it.

[00:40:24.380 --> 00:40:28.160]
I thought you were, uh, even if I did have it, I don't want it.

[00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:28.980]
How do you like that?

[00:40:29.540 --> 00:40:30.040]
That's all right.

[00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:30.900]
You're right. You're right.

[00:40:30.900 --> 00:40:30.940]
You're right.

[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:31.080]
You're right.

[00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:31.380]
You're right.

[00:40:31.380 --> 00:40:32.620]
You're right.

[00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:41.360]
You're right.

[00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:41.420]
You're right.

[00:40:41.420 --> 00:40:41.420]

[00:40:41.420 --> 00:40:41.560]
You're right.

[00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:41.720]
You're right.

[00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:41.720]

[00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:41.720]

[00:40:42.060 --> 00:40:42.620]
You're right.

[00:40:42.620 --> 00:40:44.500]
You're right.

[00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:45.140]
You're right.

[00:40:45.620 --> 00:40:45.840]
You're right.

[00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:46.040]
You're right.

[00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:46.840]
You're right.

[00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:47.800]
You're right.

[00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:47.800]

[00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:47.980]
You're right.

[00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:48.180]
You're right.

[00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:48.760]
You're right.

[00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:49.080]
You're right.

[00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:49.640]
You're right.

[00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:50.160]
You're right.

[00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:50.160]

[00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:50.500]
You're right.

[00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:51.240]
You're right.

[00:40:51.740 --> 00:40:52.800]
You're right.

[00:40:54.820 --> 00:40:55.940]
You're right.

[00:40:56.060 --> 00:40:56.360]
You're right.

[00:40:56.560 --> 00:40:57.420]
You're right.

[00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:02.600]
You're right.

[00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:02.820]
Looks.

[00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:06.080]
You know in America they tried hockey on TV 100 years ago.

[00:41:06.100 --> 00:41:06.980]
I remember it very well.

[00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:10.180]
And it went over there and, uh, who that was the guy, did the game.

[00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:12.940]
Jim, not, uh, Palmer, what that was his name.

[00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:16.760]
Jim, Palmer, he was the most boring, the most, oh my God!

[00:41:17.020 --> 00:41:17.320]
I slide on!

[00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:18.640]
Here is the golden sun!

[00:41:20.380 --> 00:41:20.820]
HCF!!!

[00:41:20.820 --> 00:41:21.500]
êtez!!!

[00:41:22.260 --> 00:41:25.720]
He's caught.

[00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:26.680]
Ricky Storm!

[00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:28.720]
Mustow and here to extend this shoot out.

[00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:30.600]
He goes wide!

[00:41:30.580 --> 00:41:32.280]
And Copeland makes the same.

[00:41:33.540 --> 00:41:34.520]
Pretty exciting, huh?

[00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:34.940]
Not.

[00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:36.000]
Boy.

[00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:37.600]
Who the hell was that?

[00:41:37.700 --> 00:41:37.940]
He's out.

[00:41:38.380 --> 00:41:39.180]
Cut down the angle.

[00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:40.280]
Makes the same.

[00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:42.380]
Look to what he does here against the lock up.

[00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:43.600]
He scores!

[00:41:44.260 --> 00:41:45.240]
What a maneuver for that is.

[00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:47.040]
This whole shootout thing, man.

[00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:47.960]
It just leaves me limp.

[00:41:48.180 --> 00:41:50.760]
But nevertheless, you know, everything they got to try to spice everything up.

[00:41:51.060 --> 00:41:52.560]
Now that's what sports is all about now.

[00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:56.180]
That's where they're like 75 different guys in the booth broadcasting all the football games.

[00:41:56.580 --> 00:42:00.300]
Try to spice it up and, you know, slap each other on the ass and yuck it up.

[00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:01.660]
Ho ho ho ho!

[00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:04.000]
And you're wondering what the hell are they laughing about?

[00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:04.720]
What is so funny?

[00:42:06.100 --> 00:42:07.740]
In fact, that Danny goes on.

[00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:09.360]
They're actually consorts with Shannon Sharpe.

[00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:10.520]
I figured it out last weekend.

[00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:11.440]
Chris, you know what it is?

[00:42:11.620 --> 00:42:11.900]
What's that?

[00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:15.460]
Danny likes being on there and right next to Shannon Sharpe

[00:42:15.460 --> 00:42:17.280]
because it makes him seem that much more articulate.

[00:42:19.060 --> 00:42:19.860]
Maybe that's true?

[00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:20.700]
Yeah, yeah.

[00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:23.180]
Makes Danny seem like a rocket scientist.

[00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:25.840]
Ronnie and Danny Bois.

[00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:27.240]
Get out of my way.

[00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:29.060]
I was just holiday-wise, too.

[00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:30.480]
Quickly ship me an hose and I'll pull it.

[00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:31.600]
For later.

[00:42:31.900 --> 00:42:32.520]
Roger, shout.

[00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:34.720]
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.

[00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:36.420]
Who's that supposed to be?

[00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:38.300]
Any questions?

[00:42:39.020 --> 00:42:42.660]
Just hear those APM's ringing in, give a meme buddy Yahoo!

[00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:48.340]
Come on, it's bloodly weather to go back up together with you!

[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:53.200]
Charge it up, charge it up, charge it up, go home

[00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:55.260]
Let's jump in the hole

[00:42:55.940 --> 00:42:59.860]
To the tune of twenty percent or so

[00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:03.800]
Charge it up, charge it up to twenty grams

[00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:06.020]
Now check out my plan

[00:43:06.820 --> 00:43:10.940]
I'm writing a book and it looks like chapter 13 of Gen

[00:43:10.940 --> 00:43:15.000]
I love to hit the lottery but I'm an unlucky old smooth

[00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:20.440]
So I guess it's lovely weather to go bankrupt together with you

[00:43:21.740 --> 00:43:24.080]
You, you, you, and you

[00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:25.520]
As you said, smooth

[00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:29.600]
It's eleven o'clock, how's Joe Paluka doing by the way? Is he dead and the Alcat?

[00:43:30.420 --> 00:43:31.420]
They're both dead again

[00:43:32.020 --> 00:43:33.280]
Joe Paluka and Alcat?

[00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:34.460]
Andy Cap

[00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:36.000]
And what about the smooth?

[00:43:37.020 --> 00:43:37.700]
I think he's still going in?

[00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:38.200]
Yeah, Andy Cap?

[00:43:39.180 --> 00:43:40.660]
We got seven hundred and seven votes on the poll

[00:43:40.660 --> 00:43:42.200]
We got a shot at that thousand, man

[00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:46.720]
And if we can get eight hundred by noon, even on this day, that'll be seven forty three

[00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:49.000]
I think you got a fighting chance

[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:53.160]
Chris and then if you get to the thousand, they might give you the show when I get out of here

[00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:55.940]
Yeah, it's the Chris show

[00:43:55.940 --> 00:43:58.320]
Oh my god, can you imagine that?

[00:43:58.420 --> 00:44:01.100]
Hey, gotta be improvement over some of the crap they might put on here

[00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:03.800]
But like I said, I'm low key in it today and Monday especially

[00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:05.300]
Monday, I'm just playing the rack

[00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:09.800]
Maybe just Monday will put some people up on the rack who ought to be there

[00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:10.980]
I don't want to mention any names

[00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:12.360]
WDQA and hello

[00:44:13.620 --> 00:44:14.380]
Mr. Niel

[00:44:14.380 --> 00:44:15.800]
Yes, sir, Mr. Collar

[00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:17.560]
Let's just schedule for next week

[00:44:17.560 --> 00:44:18.580]
Have they been working on Christmas?

[00:44:19.620 --> 00:44:21.020]
No, I don't work on Tuesday

[00:44:21.980 --> 00:44:23.080]
No, that's a good job

[00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:26.580]
I didn't know if Jerky Joe was going to be taking over four years of what was going to be happening

[00:44:27.460 --> 00:44:28.600]
No, the Christmas thing, buddy

[00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:30.200]
Back to you, Paluka, wow

[00:44:30.580 --> 00:44:32.020]
5,6,7,0,5,60

[00:44:32.020 --> 00:44:34.320]
The smoothness all of a sudden have just faded badly

[00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:36.080]
Of course, that's because the delay hasn't caught up yet

[00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:37.160]
Our twenty-five minute delay

[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:40.860]
Once he catches up man, this phone is going to explode

[00:44:41.380 --> 00:44:41.780]
BANG

[00:44:41.780 --> 00:44:42.400]
We'll see

[00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:46.340]
5,6,7,0,5,60,5,60

[00:44:46.340 --> 00:44:48.700]
It's a chance for you for free to come on a year and say

[00:44:48.700 --> 00:44:51.760]
Happy holidays to all you bastards or whatever you want to do

[00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:53.840]
We don't care today, it's one of those

[00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:55.380]
You know, I don't want to overdo it today

[00:44:55.380 --> 00:44:59.300]
A lot of people are taking off, like I said, a lot of people here yesterday

[00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:03.500]
Like it got out of town, headed for the airport and they're like taking a long busman's holiday

[00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:05.940]
Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday and Tuesday

[00:45:05.940 --> 00:45:07.880]
Five days, a five-day weekend

[00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:08.840]
Sounds good to me

[00:45:09.860 --> 00:45:10.660]
WDQYM, hello

[00:45:10.660 --> 00:45:12.300]
I'm Aiden Sannin

[00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:13.680]
WDQYM, hello

[00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:15.980]
Hey, tomorrow we're going to get food in them

[00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:17.620]
WDQYM, hello

[00:45:17.620 --> 00:45:20.500]
I want to have sex with a donkey for Christmas

[00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:22.500]
WDQYM, hello

[00:45:23.140 --> 00:45:23.660]
Deal

[00:45:23.660 --> 00:45:24.600]
Yes, sir

[00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:27.180]
Happy holidays to you and George, most staff

[00:45:27.180 --> 00:45:28.700]
Back to you, thank you

[00:45:28.700 --> 00:45:31.960]
Hey, for example, it's birthday today, Brownie Brown

[00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:33.760]
Yeah

[00:45:34.740 --> 00:45:35.540]
What's your birthday?

[00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:36.780]
What's your birthday?

[00:45:36.920 --> 00:45:37.520]
For whose birthday?

[00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:38.560]
Oh, this is that in the beginning

[00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:39.200]
Do it!

[00:45:39.460 --> 00:45:39.640]
Plan!

[00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:40.460]
Stick it!

[00:45:40.580 --> 00:45:41.920]
Yes, stick it, I think, in your case

[00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:44.080]
Do it!

[00:45:44.620 --> 00:45:46.220]
Get yourself some mental helps, sir

[00:45:46.220 --> 00:45:49.740]
I'm sure they've got some low-cost clinics where they can give you some real serious ass systems

[00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:51.500]
WDQYM, hello

[00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:52.880]
Hello

[00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:53.760]
Yes, sir

[00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:54.420]
Are you Rogers?

[00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:55.500]
That's me

[00:45:57.640 --> 00:45:58.440]
Uncle Neil

[00:45:58.960 --> 00:45:59.360]
Yeah

[00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:03.280]
I'm a little bit...

[00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:03.480]
What?

[00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:04.980]
What do you got?

[00:46:06.100 --> 00:46:12.940]
No, I've just been listening to you, I'm 35 years, we're the same, I think, and I've kept my passport and I'm moving to Mexico

[00:46:12.940 --> 00:46:14.540]
And I just wanted to say goodbye

[00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:16.280]
Okay, well, good luck to you, sir

[00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:19.840]
Anybody would move to Mexico, a boy needs some serious ass systems, wow

[00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:22.240]
In fact, I got some people you can take with you

[00:46:24.460 --> 00:46:25.560]
Oh, that was bad

[00:46:26.780 --> 00:46:29.700]
And very untrue, by the way, you were so unfair to Mexicans

[00:46:30.940 --> 00:46:34.140]
Just a lot of averages says there's about to be a few good Mexicans

[00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:36.260]
I imagine

[00:46:37.420 --> 00:46:39.900]
Just a lot of averages is made to people in Mexico

[00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:42.600]
I've only ever met one I didn't like and I told you about that guy

[00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:43.820]
Well, there you go, see?

[00:46:45.580 --> 00:46:47.540]
I don't think I ever met any I didn't like yet

[00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:48.520]
Yet

[00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:51.240]
WDQYM, hello

[00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:55.300]
Hey, you know, I was your diabetes doing

[00:46:55.300 --> 00:46:57.240]
It's doing bad, very bad

[00:46:58.580 --> 00:47:04.600]
Very bad, I eat, it's a miracle to me that I'm still alive, I have no idea why I'm still alive, I have no idea

[00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:10.400]
I eat crap, candy, ice cream, just by the bucket full, by the barrel full

[00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:14.840]
Okay, well maybe you should share something with Charlie Joe Bell there

[00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:17.520]
Yeah, okay, WDQYM, hello

[00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:19.140]
Don't Bell's my plan

[00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:22.940]
WDQYM, how many is, yeah, I'm sure that, QYM, hello

[00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:23.920]
Hey, no

[00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:24.840]
Yes, sir

[00:47:25.660 --> 00:47:29.200]
I just want to say all the sheep out there that Christmas is a fake holiday

[00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:31.540]
It's a one of fake holiday

[00:47:31.540 --> 00:47:34.000]
It's a fake holiday, put up on a retailer

[00:47:34.500 --> 00:47:38.520]
All you do is get broken, bigger rich, I'm tired of it, I'm leaving

[00:47:39.060 --> 00:47:40.020]
Okay, see ya

[00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:45.580]
CN Mars is about ready to get hit by this big asteroid, so I'll see you on the red planet

[00:47:45.580 --> 00:47:48.740]
Now what's going to happen if Mars gets knocked off orbit or something?

[00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:50.940]
On, it's going to be the entire, what?

[00:47:51.380 --> 00:47:51.380]

[00:47:51.860 --> 00:47:52.560]
How do you know that?

[00:47:52.820 --> 00:47:53.740]
I don't, I'm just kidding

[00:47:53.740 --> 00:47:57.060]
Isn't that screw up the entire solar system? I mean are we all kind of in concert?

[00:47:57.280 --> 00:47:57.760]
You know the plan is like this?

[00:47:57.760 --> 00:47:59.420]
You miss it about my plans, yeah, I don't think so

[00:47:59.420 --> 00:47:59.760]
Yeah, I don't think so

[00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:01.800]
You miss it about my plans like Tessio would say

[00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:03.940]
Let's play a whole bunch of Godfather crap

[00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:07.460]
Where the hell is that line by Tessio? I'm, you know, here it is

[00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:09.920]
It screws up all my range, right?

[00:48:09.980 --> 00:48:11.420]
All my range, man, that's right

[00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:13.300]
Time can you give me your dog?

[00:48:14.120 --> 00:48:15.140]
Roll time, say

[00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:16.560]
Can't do it, Sally

[00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:19.100]
Can't do it, Sally, and they say don't call me Sally

[00:48:21.900 --> 00:48:24.100]
Don't call me, so you watch the entire Godfather, huh?

[00:48:24.220 --> 00:48:25.960]
Not the whole thing, I guess you didn't do it

[00:48:27.100 --> 00:48:27.420]
Hmm?

[00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:29.040]
You see what I'm gonna want?

[00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:29.400]
What?

[00:48:29.700 --> 00:48:30.460]
There's Josh Quartus

[00:48:31.620 --> 00:48:33.540]
We can put him on the spot about working next week

[00:48:33.540 --> 00:48:38.060]
Yeah, what is your story, man? I just sent you a bunch of money and now you're shining us

[00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:40.980]
What are you talking about, man?

[00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:45.200]
I've been told that you aren't available to work next week when George is on vacation

[00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:46.040]
Of course not

[00:48:46.980 --> 00:48:48.000]
Of course not what?

[00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:50.320]
Well, two reasons, number one I would never work on Christmas

[00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:52.960]
But number two, I'm gonna first of all, I'm not gonna be here on Christmas

[00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:54.700]
You don't have to worry about being there on Christmas

[00:48:54.700 --> 00:48:55.920]
Okay, I leave Sunday

[00:48:55.920 --> 00:48:58.160]
Quartus is gonna do this show on Christmas

[00:48:58.160 --> 00:49:01.080]
Which God only knows what kind of show that's gonna be, but anyway

[00:49:01.460 --> 00:49:04.980]
Well, I'm flattered, you're asking me to do the show, is that, is that what I'm getting here?

[00:49:05.900 --> 00:49:09.500]
But, but either way, I'm gonna be up in like New York, man

[00:49:09.500 --> 00:49:11.500]
From the 23rd through the 27th

[00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:15.260]
So you still haven't spent that money, is that what you're saying?

[00:49:15.780 --> 00:49:18.220]
Oh, you noticed the check out cash, did you know?

[00:49:18.360 --> 00:49:20.140]
Very fast, yeah, I did notice you know

[00:49:20.140 --> 00:49:24.320]
I thought I was gonna get, you know, two checks there

[00:49:24.320 --> 00:49:26.400]
You stiff me for a while, but that's cool, man

[00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:28.600]
Ha ha ha ha ha

[00:49:30.820 --> 00:49:32.700]
I'm just gonna have to get it all off of it

[00:49:32.700 --> 00:49:37.120]
Everything that Brandon has ever said about you, I multiply it times a million right now

[00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:38.760]
Who's that, is that the guy that hates me?

[00:49:39.060 --> 00:49:40.800]
Yes, that's the guy that hates you like poison

[00:49:41.460 --> 00:49:44.180]
And once you're a Russian ex-girlfriend

[00:49:44.180 --> 00:49:46.280]
Well, good, well then again, who the hell are you?

[00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:47.000]
I don't know, I'm gonna get in line

[00:49:49.020 --> 00:49:51.580]
So you gotta be in New York next week, so you're not around

[00:49:51.580 --> 00:49:55.240]
No, that's okay, Zach is already volunteered, because Zach actually likes this show

[00:49:55.240 --> 00:49:57.740]
Well, maybe when you come back from New York, we'll already be gone

[00:49:58.240 --> 00:49:59.700]
I hope not, man, don't say that

[00:49:59.700 --> 00:50:01.080]
We're gone, we're gone, you know

[00:50:01.560 --> 00:50:02.260]
Don't say that

[00:50:02.260 --> 00:50:05.580]
We might be someplace else, we might wind up somewhere else on the dial

[00:50:05.580 --> 00:50:07.660]
It could happen fairly soon, very fast

[00:50:07.660 --> 00:50:11.000]
Could be like some kind of a radio explosion, yeah

[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:13.520]
Like Rondi, as we'd say, very soon

[00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:15.740]
Well, happy holidays, Neil

[00:50:15.740 --> 00:50:18.540]
Back to it and don't dispense it all one place

[00:50:19.980 --> 00:50:21.600]
I'm not grateful, bastard

[00:50:22.620 --> 00:50:23.480]
Hey, it's all right

[00:50:23.480 --> 00:50:24.960]
W-Q-A-M, hello

[00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:26.400]
I'll get this to happen

[00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:28.060]
W-Q-A-M, hello

[00:50:28.060 --> 00:50:31.720]
If something happens to Mars, you can kiss your rein, it's goodbye

[00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:34.380]
Oh, all right

[00:50:35.460 --> 00:50:37.340]
W-Q-A-M, hello

[00:50:39.020 --> 00:50:41.680]
My god, that's my wife's smell down there

[00:50:41.680 --> 00:50:43.720]
W-Q-A-M, hello

[00:50:44.380 --> 00:50:44.780]
Neil

[00:50:45.340 --> 00:50:46.340]
Back to him, yes

[00:50:46.820 --> 00:50:47.220]
Neil

[00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:48.580]
What are you doing?

[00:50:48.900 --> 00:50:49.500]
Neil, yes

[00:50:49.500 --> 00:50:53.880]
Neil, long time listener, I've been listening to you for probably about 25 years

[00:50:54.580 --> 00:50:57.600]
What's this rumor right here that you might believe in us, Neil? What's going on?

[00:50:57.620 --> 00:50:59.300]
It's not a rumor, it's not a rumor

[00:50:59.620 --> 00:51:01.100]
Are you really out of here, buddy?

[00:51:01.880 --> 00:51:03.160]
Out of the station, yes

[00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:06.140]
Okay, are you still staying on South Florida radio?

[00:51:06.260 --> 00:51:10.100]
That is correct, first I know if anybody wants me, if they don't want me, I'll just go kill myself

[00:51:10.100 --> 00:51:12.000]
You do not have a job yet, Neil

[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:13.220]
No, not yet

[00:51:14.300 --> 00:51:17.320]
Okay, Neil, what's your last day at N-Q-A-M?

[00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:22.080]
I haven't got any idea, I don't know, I'll let you know, just relax, could be up to a year, but I hope not

[00:51:23.140 --> 00:51:25.940]
Neil, I love you, I want to wish you a very happy holiday

[00:51:25.940 --> 00:51:28.940]
Okay, and the same to you, sir, I haven't had any happy whatever, you're just killing me

[00:51:29.700 --> 00:51:30.020]
Wow

[00:51:31.940 --> 00:51:36.820]
He's a good guy, but just annoying, you know, there's some people that are good people, but they just, they don't mean to be annoying, they just are

[00:51:36.820 --> 00:51:37.440]
And that was him

[00:51:40.460 --> 00:51:42.120]
760 votes on a poll, wow

[00:51:42.620 --> 00:51:44.260]
I think you're going to do it

[00:51:44.260 --> 00:51:45.480]
Oh, I might hit that grant

[00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:50.400]
767, I've flown on many of those, I prefer the 747 myself

[00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:53.060]
Come back from Amsterdam, I was in the upper deck aren't you impressed?

[00:51:53.460 --> 00:51:53.720]
Indeed

[00:51:54.160 --> 00:52:00.580]
And nobody next to me, when I flew over there was nobody next to me, and coming back there was nobody next to me, and I don't know about you, well you haven't flown that much

[00:52:00.580 --> 00:52:01.160]
A long time

[00:52:01.160 --> 00:52:12.500]
A long time, but when I fly, and especially the kind of ridiculous rates they charge in business class, unless I'm taking a friend along or something like that, I don't want to be sitting next to them stranger for $70

[00:52:14.220 --> 00:52:20.860]
Especially somebody who smells bad or is working too damn much wine or just, you know, slobbering all over the place, I don't want that

[00:52:20.860 --> 00:52:23.200]
I want to be alone

[00:52:23.740 --> 00:52:28.860]
Yeah, it gives you more room to spread out and throw your crap around and your newspapers and stuff like that

[00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:31.680]
WDQYM, hello

[00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:32.860]
I'm out of your mouth

[00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:34.220]
WDQYM, hello

[00:52:34.920 --> 00:52:36.040]
Hey, Neil, how you doing?

[00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:36.940]
Okay sir

[00:52:37.500 --> 00:52:40.860]
What are your plans this year, New Year's Eve, what do you do then next?

[00:52:40.980 --> 00:52:45.740]
I'm not working on New Year's Eve, I do nothing, I stay in, I stay away from all the crazy people like you

[00:52:45.740 --> 00:52:46.780]
Are you going to miss Hank?

[00:52:47.580 --> 00:52:49.680]
Are you going to miss Hank? What does that mean?

[00:52:50.100 --> 00:52:54.000]
Like you know, your friendship, I don't know, is it going to end? You guys talk closely up here?

[00:52:54.140 --> 00:52:55.240]
No, we don't

[00:52:55.240 --> 00:52:56.380]
So you're going to miss him then?

[00:52:56.640 --> 00:52:59.640]
I had dinner with Hank once at Pompano Park many, many years ago

[00:52:59.640 --> 00:53:02.720]
So the relationship will be officially over once he leaves the day?

[00:53:02.720 --> 00:53:07.060]
No, what relationship? What relationship are you talking about? Start getting out of here

[00:53:07.060 --> 00:53:08.980]
Jamit, jam on it

[00:53:11.260 --> 00:53:11.900]
WDQYM, hello

[00:53:13.860 --> 00:53:14.280]
Hello

[00:53:14.280 --> 00:53:15.320]
Yes sir

[00:53:16.920 --> 00:53:17.520]
Hello Neil

[00:53:17.520 --> 00:53:19.120]
Let me try it again, yes

[00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:19.980]
Hi, how you doing?

[00:53:20.420 --> 00:53:24.420]
I just went to George about four o'clock this afternoon, I'm heading to a Cuban mountain

[00:53:24.420 --> 00:53:26.520]
I don't know if that's where he is going but that's where I'm heading

[00:53:26.520 --> 00:53:27.060]
Going anywhere

[00:53:27.820 --> 00:53:28.600]
Good luck with you

[00:53:28.600 --> 00:53:30.100]
Hold up there right now

[00:53:30.660 --> 00:53:32.900]
That's what I'm hoping for, I can put it in my mouth

[00:53:32.900 --> 00:53:34.080]
Okay, the locals call it

[00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:37.400]
Whoever else is, it's everybody's up, there's got Cuban, they're all all over

[00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:40.560]
Oh I see, look good, good luck to you, everybody's got a house up there, the Cuban

[00:53:40.980 --> 00:53:41.600]
WDQYM, hello

[00:53:42.700 --> 00:53:43.400]
Hello, now

[00:53:50.920 --> 00:53:52.440]
How are you this afternoon?

[00:53:52.620 --> 00:53:52.980]
Okay sir

[00:53:52.980 --> 00:53:56.240]
I have a Godfather question, can I get a little music in the background?

[00:53:57.020 --> 00:53:57.260]
Maybe

[00:53:58.080 --> 00:54:06.000]
You remember in Godfather 2 when Michael and his wife are attacked in their room?

[00:54:07.020 --> 00:54:09.360]
Mike where there's no other trouble in life with their toys?

[00:54:10.120 --> 00:54:10.260]
Yeah

[00:54:11.180 --> 00:54:13.380]
Right after that attack, Michael's coming in the room

[00:54:13.380 --> 00:54:15.900]
He goes to Tom Hagen and says you're going to be the new Don

[00:54:15.900 --> 00:54:16.620]
Right

[00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:21.160]
And then you don't hear anything more about it, do you remember that scene?

[00:54:21.800 --> 00:54:22.420]
Yeah of course

[00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:27.340]
Well how come they didn't really go into it anymore about Tom being the new Don?

[00:54:27.540 --> 00:54:29.580]
I mean that was just...

[00:54:29.580 --> 00:54:34.820]
He used to use the new Don for a few days until Michael showed up in the next scene again, okay?

[00:54:35.420 --> 00:54:39.040]
They didn't want to waste any more footage because it was already a 75 hour movie

[00:54:39.740 --> 00:54:40.260]
Okay

[00:54:41.040 --> 00:54:46.920]
And you do notice that when Michael ever says anything with the word R, it comes out with a W like Waco instead of Waco

[00:54:46.920 --> 00:54:49.420]
Waco yeah, Waco, he's a twerkwiste

[00:54:50.040 --> 00:54:50.700]
A twerkwiste

[00:54:50.700 --> 00:54:52.400]
See you have the right day Neil

[00:54:52.400 --> 00:54:53.000]
You too

[00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:54.580]
He's a twerkwiste

[00:54:55.900 --> 00:54:59.840]
And then of course Michael has one of his many diabetic attacks, his seizures there

[00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:03.200]
He's a better runnykin oran's hallucinant

[00:55:03.200 --> 00:55:04.380]
Can be, you remember that?

[00:55:04.380 --> 00:55:06.620]
Yep, they just had it right there off screen

[00:55:06.620 --> 00:55:08.880]
That is whole tray full of juice and candy

[00:55:08.880 --> 00:55:10.920]
Yeah well they always have that as a Vatican

[00:55:10.920 --> 00:55:13.260]
You know, a lot of probably never know about that

[00:55:13.260 --> 00:55:14.540]
A lot of sweet treats

[00:55:14.540 --> 00:55:15.400]
Sure, that's a good idea

[00:55:15.400 --> 00:55:17.780]
You get those altar boys man, little candy, little something sweet

[00:55:18.460 --> 00:55:20.300]
But anyway and then of course he's our cake

[00:55:20.300 --> 00:55:22.500]
Cake, he's offering cake, cake, they were a guy

[00:55:22.500 --> 00:55:25.500]
And every scene he's eating cake, he's diabetic, he's like me

[00:55:26.500 --> 00:55:28.700]
He's addicted to sugar man, that's the problem

[00:55:30.040 --> 00:55:32.540]
From minutes after 11 and 5, 5, 60 that

[00:55:32.540 --> 00:55:34.920]
And of course he's eating pasta too man

[00:55:35.540 --> 00:55:37.460]
Mine, Javanje, oh mom ate a little dinner

[00:55:37.460 --> 00:55:38.760]
Bada bada bada bada

[00:55:38.760 --> 00:55:39.300]
Remember that?

[00:55:39.580 --> 00:55:40.560]
Mm hmm

[00:55:42.260 --> 00:55:43.780]
Top 8 jincol, look what I got

[00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:46.460]
That was a great scene with the keen downstairs

[00:55:48.440 --> 00:55:49.540]
There was so mean to him

[00:55:50.100 --> 00:55:50.980]
Through Tom Hagen?

[00:55:51.400 --> 00:55:51.760]
Yeah

[00:55:52.540 --> 00:55:53.640]
Michael, why do you hurt me?

[00:55:54.180 --> 00:55:55.840]
Remember that when I asked are you leaving?

[00:55:56.080 --> 00:55:56.660]
Yeah, yeah

[00:55:57.140 --> 00:55:58.160]
Michael, why do you hurt me?

[00:55:58.280 --> 00:56:00.240]
They just treated him like crap cause he was like the adopted

[00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:03.420]
Because he's Irish, right? German Irish. German. Well, let me tell you something.

[00:56:03.940 --> 00:56:09.160]
My crout-mic friend? That guy was great. He's dead too, by the way. What a shame.

[00:56:09.480 --> 00:56:12.480]
Well, let me tell you something, my crout-mic friend. Jack Waltzkin.

[00:56:13.700 --> 00:56:18.900]
Well, there's another siren out there, man. I told you, these people drive so bad, or maybe just some old fart had a heart attack.

[00:56:19.660 --> 00:56:22.120]
Maybe I'll have a heart attack and croak on here one of these days.

[00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:26.120]
Not on this station, though. That's one thing I want to get out of here before I croak.

[00:56:26.120 --> 00:56:27.740]
There you bastards.

[00:56:31.960 --> 00:56:41.000]
Dead dead dead, someday you'll be dead. Dead dead dead, someday we'll all be dead.

[00:56:44.220 --> 00:56:48.820]
The mint ribbon we start dying, we die a little more every day.

[00:56:50.480 --> 00:56:54.800]
Younger old Richard Ford, there's nothing we can do to stop it.

[00:56:55.660 --> 00:57:00.800]
So we look long at that Christmas tree, it may be the last one that you see.

[00:57:01.360 --> 00:57:10.460]
That great your house in green and red, because someday you'll be dead. Dead dead dead, someday you'll be dead.

[00:57:11.100 --> 00:57:15.100]
Dead dead dead, someday we'll all be dead.

[00:57:18.800 --> 00:57:22.900]
It might have been there in a couple months or 50 years from now.

[00:57:24.020 --> 00:57:28.220]
But no matter when it happens, it will seem to soon you.

[00:57:29.820 --> 00:57:34.340]
So we sure on Christmas Eve when you snuggle into bed.

[00:57:35.460 --> 00:57:44.460]
That you'll think God for your family, because someday they'll be dead. Dead dead dead, someday they'll be dead.

[00:57:45.120 --> 00:57:49.780]
Dead dead dead, someday we'll all be dead. All right.

[00:57:52.900 --> 00:57:56.820]
Who knows how many Christmas is left in their short life?

[00:57:58.900 --> 00:58:02.180]
Nobody knows that's my point. Enjoy the while you can.

[00:58:03.740 --> 00:58:07.800]
And so on Christmas morning, let good tidings fill your head.

[00:58:09.900 --> 00:58:21.600]
What a festive season, someday you'll be dead. Dead dead dead, someday we'll be dead. Dead dead dead, every one you know.

man gambling is a sin at the dog the anti-dog racing crowd they're all air

[01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:08.180]
there's like seven thousand groups involved in all this crap

[01:04:08.180 --> 01:04:11.800]
we don't want it we don't want it is evil it's bad we don't want it

[01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:14.100]
but it's gonna bring a lot of money we don't want it

[01:04:15.940 --> 01:04:19.060]
anything where people might have fun that might raise a lot of money for the

[01:04:19.060 --> 01:04:22.480]

[01:05:51.180 --> 01:05:53.900]
May you find the day

[01:05:55.520 --> 01:05:58.740]
Perhaps a dicker and ties it to your trucks

[01:05:58.740 --> 01:06:00.440]
Okay there you go great let's sedump that

[01:06:01.440 --> 01:06:03.520]
Wow now why didn't you remind me of that

[01:06:04.580 --> 01:06:07.220]
Remind you obviously I remembered it as well as you did

[01:06:07.220 --> 01:06:11.740]
I see well we had a dump a Christmas reading there for you

[01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:13.760]
Oh baby

[01:06:14.660 --> 01:06:15.060]
Wooo

[01:06:16.620 --> 01:06:20.360]
Well what's the point of time we could play that but then again what's the point of time we could play a lot of stuff?

[01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:21.900]
Not no mole, not now

[01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:27.280]
Everybody's really uptight and out of sight with Stevie Wonder speaking of whatever he just said

[01:06:28.360 --> 01:06:31.440]
1132, 28 till noon at 560 WTQA in

[01:06:31.440 --> 01:06:33.600]
So what's that Curtis got to do on Christmas day?

[01:06:34.700 --> 01:06:36.400]
I have no idea what Curtis is showing

[01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:37.600]
He does a sports show what?

[01:06:38.060 --> 01:06:39.340]
Maybe he'll do a non-sports show

[01:06:39.820 --> 01:06:40.420]
You think?

[01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:44.960]
A lot of these people have other things going on in their lives I know it doesn't seem that way

[01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:46.600]
No not when you listen

[01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:47.160]
No

[01:06:47.900 --> 01:06:49.300]
I wait till you're this story

[01:06:49.880 --> 01:06:53.260]
This will make you almost forget about that last bit that I was playing that we had a dump

[01:06:54.600 --> 01:06:59.380]
A devon group of evangelical Christians in the New Wester flocking to help purify a spot

[01:06:59.380 --> 01:07:03.260]
They believe the Bible is ordained as holy ground and happens to be

[01:07:03.260 --> 01:07:06.040]
1500 miles of interstate asphalt

[01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:13.900]
Why the location of courtesy and then the small contingent of churchgoers believe that interstate 35

[01:07:14.540 --> 01:07:20.880]
A sprawling highway running from Texas to Minnesota is specifically mentioned in the book of Isaiah chapter 35

[01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:21.880]
I have all right

[01:07:23.840 --> 01:07:24.640]
I, 35

[01:07:25.640 --> 01:07:27.400]
A highway shall be there in a road

[01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:29.140]
reads the port to the chapters verse 8

[01:07:29.140 --> 01:07:30.920]
And it shall be called the highway of holiness

[01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:33.340]
The young clean shall not pass over it

[01:07:33.340 --> 01:07:34.560]
You're unclean

[01:07:35.820 --> 01:07:40.020]
But if I 35 is indeed to play some Christians believe there's a lot of work to be done before the road can

[01:07:40.020 --> 01:07:42.960]
fulfill it saintly destiny according to CNN's Gary Tuckman

[01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:46.840]
who was on the scene in Texas as believers launched an effort to pray for the road

[01:07:48.460 --> 01:07:52.560]
Churchgoers in all six states recently finished 35 days of praying along in interstate 35

[01:07:52.560 --> 01:07:59.480]
But the prayers are still continuing reports Tuckman some of the faithful believe that in order to fulfill the prophecy of I-35ing the holy highway

[01:08:00.340 --> 01:08:05.180]
It needs some intensive prayer first just like we do on the show pray for us plays

[01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:11.260]
So we watch this about 25 fervent and enthusiastic Christians prayed on the interstate's shoulder and Dallas

[01:08:11.260 --> 01:08:18.400]
Their prayers go off for safer neighborhoods more godliness and also in hopes that businesses limiting the lining the highway including strip clubs

[01:08:18.400 --> 01:08:22.460]
Another unclean establishments like clean up the rack strip clubs on the highway. Oh no

[01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:24.780]
What would Isaiah have thought about that?

[01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:27.700]
Probably would have said oh God that's good

[01:08:28.260 --> 01:08:31.320]
Tuckman says the unfaithful also point to a link between the area near this highway

[01:08:31.320 --> 01:08:35.900]
And tragedies that have happened in history such as the bridge collapse in I-35 Minneapolis last August

[01:08:35.900 --> 01:08:41.000]
And the assassination of JFK 44 years ago near I-35 in Dallas

[01:08:42.540 --> 01:08:48.540]
We just want to say wow why would this happen on one highway one of the prayer champions organizers Cindy Jacobs sold CNN

[01:08:48.540 --> 01:08:51.240]
Let's pray that to be safety for everyone on these highways

[01:08:51.240 --> 01:08:52.600]
We want to say wow

[01:08:53.860 --> 01:08:58.340]
Helping to publicize the groups efforts is Christian televangelist the crazy lunatic pet Robertson

[01:08:58.340 --> 01:09:01.900]
Who's featured the I-35 prayers on his Christian broadcasting network

[01:09:01.900 --> 01:09:08.160]
What an amazing story Robertson says well wouldn't that be wonderful cut a line right down the middle of America and let it spread to both coasts

[01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:11.140]
Oh my goodness I-35

[01:09:13.620 --> 01:09:18.140]
What I always tell you man the religious people are the crazy people and the more religious they are the

[01:09:19.260 --> 01:09:20.600]
The crazy they are

[01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:25.260]
And all your kids out there let me just take it right now the whole sandy clause thing it's a lie

[01:09:25.260 --> 01:09:28.360]
It's a lie but take all the gifts man it's nice to get presents sure

[01:09:29.420 --> 01:09:38.420]
It's nice to get presents too especially if you see the smile and the enthusiasm and you know the happiness on the other person's face sometimes

[01:09:39.300 --> 01:09:44.060]
810 votes on the pool how Sean Taylor do now that was the late edition we apologize for that oversight

We got dog racing we got horse racing we had a harness racing at a highlight we got the lotto

[01:11:07.800 --> 01:11:11.920]
But for some strange reason casinos oh

Oh my god look what it could be like Vegas look how bad that is look how terrible things are going there

[01:11:22.140 --> 01:11:25.060]
Well why are these old parts calling me today because you know it's so

[01:11:25.060 --> 01:11:29.660]

They dropped the steel on the back down the 15 here

[01:12:02.580 --> 01:12:03.000]
Yeah

[01:12:04.300 --> 01:12:06.080]
They can use your buddy can't be how all this oh

[01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:11.260]
Okay, that's the a single right there that call inspired me to do it well

[01:12:11.260 --> 01:12:13.100]
I'm coming hour and 37 minutes not bad

[01:12:13.100 --> 01:12:14.120]
Mm-hmm

[01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:18.460]
Actually taking a few calls today which I had no intention doing because I knew it was going to be a really

[01:12:19.060 --> 01:12:21.760]
Limited you know and it's it's that time

[01:12:22.540 --> 01:12:26.740]
They're not out there we have a very limited available audience today and of course most days

[01:12:27.580 --> 01:12:27.980]
Oh

[01:12:29.160 --> 01:12:34.020]
But I'm not unlike I said I'm on my best behavior today and Monday especially because Monday is like Christmas Eve

[01:12:34.020 --> 01:12:41.240]
And I'm gonna like play all kinds of good stuff and that's it I'm gonna bite my tongue so hard a dripping blood all down my nice and a blue shirt

[01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:49.280]
819 votes on your pool Chris is really confident he's gonna get that thousand but you know something as time goes on

[01:12:50.440 --> 01:12:55.940]
And is this day or just continues more and more people are gonna be taking off from work and leaving and taking off from town

[01:12:55.940 --> 01:13:02.560]
Going and doing their Christmas their holiday craft you know I mean well it takes a minute to vote and only it doesn't take a minute to vote

[01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:06.220]
It takes a matter of seconds. Although you're right with this list. There's a long list on there

[01:13:07.520 --> 01:13:12.360]
So what her father dry and I did he's only got me and one other person two votes what a shame

[01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:17.860]
And isn't it interesting that I voted for a Catholic priest how do you like that you see?

[01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:21.920]
I wrote it isn't very ironic and very surprising but then again

[01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:25.980]
They don't know father dry and like I did he was he was a great liberal with a big mouth

[01:13:25.980 --> 01:13:32.080]
He told it like it was he exposed all the right wing bull crap before it was you know politically expedient to do so

[01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:37.740]
And of course even now here we are all these years later and the Democrats still don't have the balls to open up a mouth and tell it like it is

[01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:46.280]
Because the motto of the Democratic Party is if it's possible to fail we'll do it we'll find a way we'll find the way

[01:13:47.880 --> 01:13:52.760]
Failure be us they keep showing the story about the early retirement of this marine dog you know his

[01:13:54.180 --> 01:13:55.480]
His master got killed

[01:13:57.140 --> 01:14:02.860]
And they keep showing his German Shepherd nice dog but you don't need if you want to have a dog you can get know from a doctor

[01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:11.260]
You know when you go on and talk about wanting to go off into the hills of Montana or North Carolina

[01:14:11.260 --> 01:14:16.620]
Yep, sometimes I think you're a little bit over the top of that but the more I think about it I want to be a

[01:14:16.620 --> 01:14:18.820]
Best out

[01:14:18.820 --> 01:14:22.720]
You're five sixty QAM

[01:14:23.260 --> 01:14:26.320]
Force leader I bet you best

[01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:28.460]
Yes, sir yes

[01:14:35.140 --> 01:14:37.740]
About one big is

[01:14:38.760 --> 01:14:49.280]
And we're talking about bridges over the causeway not the ones in your mouth. I don't have any my friends. Okay. Yeah

[01:14:53.480 --> 01:14:59.740]
Well, it is all bridges over now look a little waterway if I knew that I wouldn't have been asking say I

[01:15:00.340 --> 01:15:03.720]
Said if I knew the answer to the question I wouldn't have asked it in the first place

[01:15:03.720 --> 01:15:05.600]
Okay, well, I'm saying sir

[01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:13.540]
Is that the United States Corps of Engineers are the ones that regulate bridges over Navable waterways over one

[01:15:13.540 --> 01:15:21.120]
Navigable waterways yes, sir. Okay. Okay. Yeah, so it's up to them to decide what time

[01:15:21.720 --> 01:15:26.480]
The bridges should not be open to the marine traffic. Yes

[01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:30.320]
And what time should they not be open to marine traffic sir?

[01:15:31.420 --> 01:15:36.200]
I'm telling you that they come up with the time well what is the time?

[01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:41.080]
I believe is that watch our times sir

[01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:47.440]
That they are not open to marine traffic other than that they are open to marine traffic

[01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:51.000]
So in other words any slump with a boat can come along and back up traffic for you

[01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:51.660]
Absolutely

[01:15:52.200 --> 01:15:55.220]
Correct. Well, what kind of a communist bunch of crap is that?

[01:15:57.140 --> 01:15:59.080]
Sounds like some kind of the end of all

[01:15:59.080 --> 01:16:04.700]
To one vote right exactly

[01:16:08.460 --> 01:16:14.300]
No, I think that 50,000 cars ought to stop for one jackass in his boat. I think that's what they ought to do

[01:16:15.180 --> 01:16:19.160]
Man, you better know your law is Mr. Because you sure don't that's right

[01:16:19.160 --> 01:16:23.920]
I suppose you want the man bridges closed to both traffic and a hurricane too

[01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:27.240]
I want the bridges closed period. Okay. I want them closed

[01:16:27.240 --> 01:16:33.300]
I want the bridge tent to go home and watch his MTV and get the hell out of our lives. I want those bridges closed

[01:16:33.300 --> 01:16:37.000]
Let him use the junior tunnel. Okay. Let him use them a carpet cause

[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:41.860]
I think they ought to go on a George Washington bridge and jump all of bridge tenters. How do you like that, sir?

[01:16:42.460 --> 01:16:46.160]
Well, I don't know about you but you sound like some stupid idiotic

[01:16:47.380 --> 01:16:51.260]
After years of drug abuse and controversial rehabilitation

[01:16:51.260 --> 01:16:56.420]

Thanks for granting us this interview Brian

[01:16:59.960 --> 01:17:03.420]
Brian, do you have any idea how retarded you sound?

[01:17:06.060 --> 01:17:11.160]
Show you what I mean. Here's how you sounded back in 62 from this early Beachboy recording session

[01:17:12.340 --> 01:17:15.020]
Hey man, did you like it?

[01:17:17.960 --> 01:17:18.500]

Oh, that's very nice Brian

[01:17:35.280 --> 01:17:36.900]
Do you like it?

[01:17:36.920 --> 01:17:38.620]
That's a little hard to dance too

[01:17:38.620 --> 01:17:45.940]
Do you like it? Yeah, very nice Brian

Oh yeah, I'm sorry

[01:18:08.620 --> 01:18:11.620]
Oi

[01:18:38.620 --> 01:18:44.100]
One day he was stuffed and after he had made the deal

[01:18:44.100 --> 01:18:46.320]
It turned out to be a cop

[01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:49.480]
Oh, now he's in prison

[01:18:49.480 --> 01:18:52.460]
Making love to other men

[01:18:52.460 --> 01:18:57.500]
No, he isn't gay but he had to pay the billy end

[01:18:57.500 --> 01:18:58.660]
The end

[01:18:58.660 --> 01:19:02.080]
Humpen is run from humpen is run from

[01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:03.640]
Look at the convict

[01:19:03.640 --> 01:19:08.060]
Oh, humpen is run from humpen is run from

[01:19:08.060 --> 01:19:10.340]
All because of love

[01:19:10.340 --> 01:19:10.760]
Rectum

[01:19:14.060 --> 01:19:17.060]
Grandma got run over at the Walmart

[01:19:18.280 --> 01:19:20.980]
Troubled under shoppers greedy feet

[01:19:20.980 --> 01:19:22.400]
Get out of my way, you curver

[01:19:22.400 --> 01:19:24.980]
It was on the day after Thanksgiving

[01:19:24.980 --> 01:19:29.060]
Oh, a poor grandma didn't know she'd be dead meat

[01:19:29.060 --> 01:19:31.000]
Every year we now withdraw

[01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:32.960]
All she wanted was a player

[01:19:32.960 --> 01:19:37.160]
Congratulations, you ruined Chris more the DVD she owned

[01:19:37.160 --> 01:19:38.500]
Merry Christmas and his man

[01:19:38.500 --> 01:19:41.120]
But when those faithful doors swung open

[01:19:41.120 --> 01:19:41.820]
Well, when the Walmart

[01:19:41.820 --> 01:19:44.900]
She was stepped on and banked up straight to the bone

[01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.060]
Grandma's now white out of action

[01:19:50.700 --> 01:19:53.260]
In a hospital she sits

[01:19:54.780 --> 01:19:57.080]
After her body is in traction

[01:19:58.160 --> 01:20:00.740]
And she even needs a nurse to take ice cream

[01:20:01.600 --> 01:20:02.200]
Pfft

[01:20:02.200 --> 01:20:05.140]
Grandma got run over at the Walmart

[01:20:06.180 --> 01:20:09.220]
Troubled under shoppers greedy feet

[01:20:09.220 --> 01:20:13.000]
It was on the day after Thanksgiving

[01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:14.180]
Don't

[01:20:14.180 --> 01:20:16.920]
Poor grandma didn't know she'd be dead meat

[01:20:16.920 --> 01:20:17.600]
You're a kid

[01:20:18.140 --> 01:20:21.180]
Grandma got run over at the Walmart

[01:20:22.200 --> 01:20:25.000]
Troubled under shoppers greedy feet

[01:20:25.900 --> 01:20:29.120]
It was on the day after Thanksgiving

[01:20:29.120 --> 01:20:32.920]
Poor grandma didn't know she'd be dead meat

[01:20:32.920 --> 01:20:35.300]
No, operator, give me the number for 9-1-1

[01:20:35.300 --> 01:20:37.680]
Merry Christmas everybody, watch your ass

[01:20:38.640 --> 01:20:40.940]
So this is Christmas

[01:20:43.020 --> 01:20:46.020]
And you know this song

[01:20:47.840 --> 01:20:51.120]
But when my wife is singing

[01:20:52.600 --> 01:20:55.540]
It ruins it for everyone

[01:20:55.540 --> 01:21:00.520]
And so this is Christmas

[01:21:02.460 --> 01:21:05.820]
When we sing we all like

[01:21:07.360 --> 01:21:10.660]
Or as soon as you hear your girl

[01:21:12.540 --> 01:21:15.140]
I wish it's right for her for like

[01:21:15.140 --> 01:21:17.500]
You're the healthy as she calls

[01:21:17.500 --> 01:21:22.220]
Merry Christmas and his man

[01:21:22.220 --> 01:21:25.160]
And I have a new name

[01:21:25.160 --> 01:21:27.180]
Oh, boy

[01:21:27.180 --> 01:21:30.640]
That's so sweet, so good call

[01:21:30.640 --> 01:21:31.920]
Oh, now you can hear

[01:21:31.920 --> 01:21:34.120]
We're not any sweet

[01:21:34.120 --> 01:21:38.220]
Splat, splat, splat, splat, splat

[01:21:39.780 --> 01:21:40.180]
Phew

[01:21:40.180 --> 01:21:41.880]
Thank you, Merry Christmas

[01:21:41.880 --> 01:21:44.020]
Now I can bully well-rest in peace

[01:21:44.020 --> 01:21:47.200]
Now back to the Neil Rogers program

[01:21:47.200 --> 01:21:49.720]

Okay, I guess we're done with Neil

[01:22:00.720 --> 01:22:03.420]
And there's four minutes left in the hour

[01:22:03.420 --> 01:22:05.040]
Who's fixing calls?

[01:22:05.500 --> 01:22:06.560]
The Orleans, hello

[01:22:06.560 --> 01:22:08.400]
And a Neil, how's it going?

[01:22:09.020 --> 01:22:09.400]
Great

[01:22:10.040 --> 01:22:10.920]
That's good

[01:22:11.720 --> 01:22:13.440]
Wresler, I can't film my subscriptions

[01:22:13.440 --> 01:22:15.880]

We're in a bush and that paper is

[01:22:21.060 --> 01:22:24.060]
There ain't as many other people that like Wres

[01:22:24.060 --> 01:22:26.000]
And they said, now my business

[01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.820]
Yeah, well, they're real nice over there

[01:22:28.820 --> 01:22:31.880]
Okay, well, I just thought I'd let you know

[01:22:32.480 --> 01:22:33.740]
You're a fine American

[01:22:33.740 --> 01:22:35.660]
Have a nice flight, hello

[01:22:35.660 --> 01:22:38.000]
I want to speak to Neil

[01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:39.640]

Yeah

[01:22:45.440 --> 01:22:48.040]
Neil, you're a stinky pink old glue sniffing

[01:22:48.040 --> 01:22:49.400]
Bed, water, and a pantry

[01:22:51.080 --> 01:22:52.140]
Great call

[01:22:52.140 --> 01:22:54.160]
This is great so far

[01:22:54.160 --> 01:22:55.320]
Did he say pantry?

[01:22:55.980 --> 01:22:57.160]
Let me sneak it off

[01:22:57.160 --> 01:22:58.780]
Not a mong bring

[01:22:59.440 --> 01:23:00.580]
I run my bike

[01:23:00.580 --> 01:23:02.500]

[01:23:02.500 --> 01:23:03.920]

[01:23:03.920 --> 01:23:06.240]
And this guy calls me named

[01:23:06.240 --> 01:23:07.620]
She'm a new sir

[01:23:07.620 --> 01:23:09.260]
She'm on you

[01:23:09.260 --> 01:23:12.020]
By the way, have you seen some of those

[01:23:12.020 --> 01:23:15.720]
Bad boys at the new AMP?

[01:23:17.880 --> 01:23:21.340]
No, what are you tackling about A?

[01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:22.920]
This is my gun

[01:23:24.480 --> 01:23:26.880]
A million producers

[01:23:26.880 --> 01:23:31.440]
Well, and they stick me in here with an A

[01:23:34.160 --> 01:23:36.240]
Shit is my car

[01:23:37.240 --> 01:23:38.580]
Show me the castle

[01:23:39.240 --> 01:23:43.760]
Oh Neil, you're supposed to be such a nice boy

[01:23:43.760 --> 01:23:45.860]
And now you're so terrible

[01:23:45.860 --> 01:23:48.180]
Yeah, but you can't share it off

[01:23:48.180 --> 01:23:49.980]
You can't share it off

[01:23:49.980 --> 01:23:53.120]
I don't need this

[01:23:54.240 --> 01:23:56.440]
Office from Everestations

But instead I stay here and entertain you

[01:24:06.780 --> 01:24:09.420]
Grotesque, Sub-Huin, Dutabag

[01:24:11.060 --> 01:24:11.580]
Unbelievable

[01:24:12.700 --> 01:24:13.800]
To me, the hell

[01:24:14.440 --> 01:24:15.980]
Hello, is this Neil Rogers?

[01:24:16.480 --> 01:24:18.360]
What kind of phone are you on, sir?

[01:24:18.880 --> 01:24:19.800]
How's that again?

[01:24:20.220 --> 01:24:22.620]
Do you have a dial phone or a watt?

[01:24:23.220 --> 01:24:25.440]
No, I have to put it to the operator

[01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:29.440]
Let's...

[01:24:30.820 --> 01:24:32.360]
Let's lock into that

[01:24:32.360 --> 01:24:36.900]
Hey, I was listening to Joey Reynolds on WKBW last night

[01:24:36.900 --> 01:24:38.240]
Somebody asked you

[01:24:38.240 --> 01:24:40.700]
Did you hear what he's been saying about you?

[01:24:40.980 --> 01:24:42.400]
No, I don't listen anymore

[01:24:42.400 --> 01:24:44.560]
He's a daughtering old man

[01:24:44.560 --> 01:24:46.820]
He claims he's only 40

[01:24:46.820 --> 01:24:50.160]
Yeah, right, and do we be true in two?

[01:24:52.300 --> 01:24:54.840]
Oh, he's trapped a drop of Saturn

[01:24:55.600 --> 01:24:59.560]
And if you think he's bad now, we totally had him

[01:24:59.560 --> 01:25:01.320]
Oh, boy

[01:25:01.880 --> 01:25:03.520]
Okay, let me come back

[01:25:03.520 --> 01:25:06.560]
Maybe the egg will come out of his shell

[01:25:07.160 --> 01:25:08.580]
But I hope not

[01:25:09.160 --> 01:25:10.880]
Well, we got the bridge to the area

[01:25:10.880 --> 01:25:13.860]
Anyway, we don't have to have anybody bugging us for that crap in

[01:25:13.860 --> 01:25:14.420]
Wow, yeah

[01:25:14.420 --> 01:25:16.140]
Well, that was good on my part

[01:25:16.140 --> 01:25:16.800]
Nice of you, Neil

[01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:18.160]

Yeah, I think so too

[01:26:42.100 --> 01:26:44.160]
For the Neil Rogers 12-to-1 hour

[01:26:44.160 --> 01:26:47.100]
Hey, pukes, Vigil and Guy Anger Anderson

[01:26:47.100 --> 01:26:48.900]
I looked in the toilet today

[01:26:48.900 --> 01:26:49.740]
Guess what?

[01:26:50.140 --> 01:26:52.920]
A Starbucks right there in my sh**

[01:26:52.920 --> 01:26:54.620]
Huh, what do you know?

[01:26:55.040 --> 01:26:56.180]
Right there in the toilet

[01:26:56.180 --> 01:26:57.000]
Crazy

[01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:58.720]
They are everywhere

[01:27:08.380 --> 01:27:11.260]
Every day that moves is morning

[01:27:11.260 --> 01:27:13.620]
We have a yellow light

[01:27:13.620 --> 01:27:15.160]
That must be

[01:27:15.160 --> 01:27:17.640]
They have something too high

[01:27:17.640 --> 01:27:19.220]
And I'll make

[01:27:19.220 --> 01:27:21.260]
But if you lay headdives

[01:27:21.840 --> 01:27:23.260]
What's really heavy

[01:27:23.880 --> 01:27:26.120]
Kind of subdued

[01:27:26.120 --> 01:27:29.620]
Is you move like a yellow light

[01:27:29.620 --> 01:27:31.280]
Does I lie?

[01:27:31.580 --> 01:27:33.620]
The corporate be a right

[01:27:33.620 --> 01:27:35.220]
And that's why

[01:27:35.220 --> 01:27:38.560]
We have a yellow light

[01:27:38.560 --> 01:27:40.680]
Catch, explain

[01:27:41.560 --> 01:27:45.000]
The meaning of what needs light too

[01:27:45.560 --> 01:27:46.680]
What needs light too

[01:27:46.680 --> 01:27:48.700]
Which is at his desk

[01:27:48.700 --> 01:27:50.740]
With a set of low pens

[01:27:50.740 --> 01:27:53.280]
And noodles got through

[01:27:54.620 --> 01:27:57.260]
And later time then

[01:27:57.260 --> 01:27:58.440]
Once in confusion

[01:27:58.440 --> 01:28:01.460]
And they have a yellow light

[01:28:01.460 --> 01:28:03.320]
With that name

[01:28:03.320 --> 01:28:05.460]
Something they can define

[01:28:05.460 --> 01:28:07.160]
I'm dry, dry, dry

[01:28:07.160 --> 01:28:09.820]
We have a yellow light

[01:28:09.820 --> 01:28:11.120]
A big light

[01:28:11.120 --> 01:28:13.140]
And they have something

[01:28:13.140 --> 01:28:14.300]
What needs to be

[01:28:14.300 --> 01:28:17.640]
They have a yellow light

[01:28:17.640 --> 01:28:19.300]
With that name

[01:28:19.300 --> 01:28:21.440]
Something they can define

[01:28:28.020 --> 01:28:33.320]
I'm dreaming of a white neighbor

[01:28:33.320 --> 01:28:34.680]
You're fairy

[01:28:34.680 --> 01:28:39.320]
Just like the ones I used to know

[01:28:39.840 --> 01:28:43.520]
Where the ones were trimmed

[01:28:43.520 --> 01:28:47.060]
And cars had rims

[01:28:47.060 --> 01:28:51.320]
And seems so very long ago

[01:28:54.500 --> 01:29:00.200]
I'm dreaming of a white neighbor

[01:29:00.200 --> 01:29:05.260]
With every four silkside I'm right

[01:29:06.200 --> 01:29:15.260]
Make your days be merry and bright

[01:29:18.120 --> 01:29:27.080]
And may all your new neighbors

[01:29:27.080 --> 01:29:33.080]
Be white

[01:29:50.460 --> 01:29:53.560]
Oh, hey, where's your old

[01:29:53.560 --> 01:29:55.080]
I can't find Roodle

[01:30:00.640 --> 01:30:01.160]
Oh, hey, where's your old

[01:30:01.800 --> 01:30:02.320]
Who's that old

Who's that old

[01:30:03.140 --> 01:30:04.340]

Hey, what's that all over the place

[01:30:08.940 --> 01:30:10.900]
It's terrible, it's terrible, yeah, yeah

[01:30:10.900 --> 01:30:11.700]
I don't know

[01:30:11.700 --> 01:30:13.400]
It takes back no time

[01:30:13.400 --> 01:30:14.780]
Oh, no, yeah, yeah, yeah

[01:30:14.780 --> 01:30:16.380]

It's a white neighbor

[01:30:41.620 --> 01:30:42.440]
It's diarrhea

[01:30:42.440 --> 01:30:44.500]
And they still got diarrhea

[01:30:45.080 --> 01:30:47.100]
Go, go, go, go

[01:30:49.180 --> 01:30:50.380]

You'll be prancing to the tune of

[01:31:20.100 --> 01:31:24.200]
At your top, asteer on the Elfra, feel the burn

[01:31:24.200 --> 01:31:26.760]
You'll also get squatting around

[01:31:26.760 --> 01:31:28.500]
The grit and street

[01:31:28.500 --> 01:31:31.240]
And slusting out your tail

[01:31:31.240 --> 01:31:32.560]
I love it

You'll be flexing your all

[01:31:34.480 --> 01:31:39.200]
And power stepping through a winter wonderland of fat burning fun

I'll eat food for a grand man

Available on Paramount's home video

[01:31:58.040 --> 01:32:00.420]
Go to a club for Chennville

[01:32:00.420 --> 01:32:02.100]
Then where all the girls disrobed

[01:32:03.080 --> 01:32:05.260]
There's one thing keeps me going

[01:32:05.260 --> 01:32:07.720]
Back the lack of their wardrobe

[01:32:07.720 --> 01:32:10.760]
Maybe one will come home with me

[01:32:10.760 --> 01:32:12.720]
Oh that is what I hope

[01:32:12.720 --> 01:32:16.420]

I wish they all were disappear

[01:32:35.040 --> 01:32:36.460]
Guess the news is low

[01:32:36.460 --> 01:32:39.940]
TV buys it apropos when the talk it hurts my ears

[01:32:39.940 --> 01:32:40.600]

He started out a regular guy who joins the directory

[01:33:28.860 --> 01:33:32.160]
And made the ultimate sacrifice

[01:33:32.160 --> 01:33:36.140]
Embracing celebrity father or two

No we, there's that we again man

[01:36:43.800 --> 01:36:45.300]
Are you speaking French or English?

[01:36:45.440 --> 01:36:46.720]
You're having this we, we, we

[01:36:46.720 --> 01:36:48.720]
We are, we are, we are

[01:36:48.720 --> 01:36:49.980]
There we go, we are

[01:36:49.980 --> 01:36:51.600]
You sound like Dan Quayle now

[01:36:51.600 --> 01:36:53.200]
Sure you can't even spell us

[01:36:53.200 --> 01:36:55.860]
You don't want to ask me to pick on the radio

[01:36:55.860 --> 01:36:56.340]
Right

[01:36:57.420 --> 01:37:00.620]
And you know you don't have to pick as we, we

[01:37:00.620 --> 01:37:02.000]
You sound like that baby now

[01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.300]
Are you in Lutzer? Are you an Aintry sir?

[01:37:04.300 --> 01:37:06.120]
I think you've been up in Aintry with us, man

[01:37:06.120 --> 01:37:08.040]
But you want admitted now and wait till tomorrow

[01:37:08.040 --> 01:37:10.300]
Some people don't

[01:37:12.640 --> 01:37:15.100]
They don't have a groove

[01:37:17.420 --> 01:37:20.000]
They walk all around

[01:37:21.940 --> 01:37:24.840]
With your head up there, blues

[01:37:26.980 --> 01:37:29.360]
There's always a song

[01:37:31.180 --> 01:37:33.880]
They're just looking in for fame

[01:37:35.920 --> 01:37:38.940]
And they love the abuse

[01:37:38.940 --> 01:37:43.580]
Or like the chronic promise

[01:37:45.600 --> 01:37:48.360]
These are chronic promise

[01:37:48.360 --> 01:37:54.080]
The biggest name of this town

[01:37:54.080 --> 01:37:55.460]
is near Rogers

[01:37:55.460 --> 01:37:58.620]
4.25.6.9.9.9

[01:37:58.620 --> 01:38:03.160]
4.5.25.6

[01:38:03.160 --> 01:38:03.540]
ih

[01:38:07.820 --> 01:38:09.320]

[01:38:11.920 --> 01:38:13.480]
We give

[01:38:13.480 --> 01:38:25.060]
Tou 26

[01:38:25.060 --> 01:38:25.840]
Stop

[01:38:22.620 --> 01:38:25.620]
Now fall

[01:38:25.840 --> 01:38:29.780]
All us red next shore of incest

[01:38:31.240 --> 01:38:36.960]
This ex-justain is good unless its family

[01:38:37.840 --> 01:38:44.840]
Because all us red next practice incest

[01:38:45.720 --> 01:38:50.760]
Now I'm my only uncle and the worries mean

[01:38:52.940 --> 01:38:56.420]
My ancestor took me with her

[01:38:56.420 --> 01:38:59.060]
But after her double wide

[01:38:59.760 --> 01:39:03.140]
What a deal ain't got no wheels

[01:39:03.140 --> 01:39:06.460]
And incised felt like something died

[01:39:06.460 --> 01:39:10.160]
It's my cheek and winked her eyes

[01:39:10.160 --> 01:39:12.960]
And said we're all alone in the house

[01:39:13.760 --> 01:39:17.220]
But I got sick when she gave me a kiss

[01:39:17.220 --> 01:39:20.980]
And chewing till back go in her mouth

[01:39:20.980 --> 01:39:25.700]
All us red next shore of incest

[01:39:26.220 --> 01:39:32.820]
A bright, this ex-justain is good unless its family

[01:39:33.940 --> 01:39:39.760]
Because all us red next practice incest

[01:39:41.240 --> 01:39:46.180]
So come meet my new wife, she's my niece

[01:39:48.400 --> 01:39:52.300]
I just got me a farm with horses

[01:39:52.300 --> 01:39:54.860]
Chickens, cows and pigs

[01:39:54.860 --> 01:39:59.060]
A four by four that I adore

[01:39:59.060 --> 01:40:02.140]
With tires that are too damn big

[01:40:02.140 --> 01:40:06.560]
The rear window it has a gun rack

[01:40:06.560 --> 01:40:09.280]
As where I keep my gun

[01:40:09.280 --> 01:40:13.180]
Rambles wagging and the wives in the back

[01:40:13.180 --> 01:40:17.060]
My neck is red for two months son

[01:40:17.060 --> 01:40:21.940]
All us red next shore of incest

[01:40:23.360 --> 01:40:28.780]
This ex-justain is good unless its family

[01:40:30.060 --> 01:40:35.720]
Because all us red next practice incest

[01:40:35.720 --> 01:40:40.320]
My sister is the one over there

[01:40:40.320 --> 01:40:42.660]
With the dirty knees

[01:40:44.520 --> 01:40:47.400]
Every human's is hard to choose

[01:40:48.360 --> 01:40:50.880]
Who's got the nicest two

[01:40:52.320 --> 01:40:56.160]
And I don't like the way my daddy has been watching me

[01:41:07.640 --> 01:41:12.820]
I had a chip name paid when they should go away

[01:41:12.820 --> 01:41:17.260]
To Teo on a weather moon is full of blue

[01:41:18.380 --> 01:41:20.960]
But with our right wing censorship

[01:41:20.960 --> 01:41:24.020]
There are words that mustn't slip

[01:41:24.020 --> 01:41:27.500]
To tell you how I feel for kids

[01:41:27.500 --> 01:41:31.240]
That feel for kids so

[01:41:32.780 --> 01:41:36.380]
With PCK into one of

[01:41:37.020 --> 01:41:39.860]
And I'll see you with Dio on a tune

[01:41:40.660 --> 01:41:44.580]
Now if you see Kate, tell her I'm a service day

[01:41:44.580 --> 01:41:49.240]
And the SCC won't let me sing this song I wrote today

[01:41:49.240 --> 01:41:52.820]
Now if you see Kate, take her hand gently say

[01:41:52.820 --> 01:41:56.940]
That after this transmission I'll be out in 90 days

[01:41:56.940 --> 01:42:00.480]
Oh, PCK into one of

[01:42:00.480 --> 01:42:04.840]
That I'll see you with Dio on a go, on a go

[01:42:04.840 --> 01:42:08.940]
But got to see you with Dio on a tune

[01:42:12.960 --> 01:42:17.300]
There was a no farmer who lived on a rock

[01:42:17.300 --> 01:42:21.120]
He's dead in the middle just shaking his fist

[01:42:21.120 --> 01:42:24.100]
That some boys who were down by the creek

[01:42:24.100 --> 01:42:26.260]
They're feeding the water

[01:42:26.260 --> 01:42:28.260]
Their hands on their marbles

[01:42:28.260 --> 01:42:30.980]
And play things in at half past four

[01:42:30.980 --> 01:42:33.040]
There came a young lady

[01:42:33.040 --> 01:42:35.960]
She looked like a pretty young creature

[01:42:35.960 --> 01:42:37.740]
She sat on the grass

[01:42:37.740 --> 01:42:41.880]
She pulled up her dress and she showed them her rumbles

[01:42:41.880 --> 01:42:44.520]
And laces and white fluffy duck

[01:42:45.120 --> 01:42:49.600]
She said she was learning a new way to bring up her children

[01:42:49.600 --> 01:42:51.420]
So they would not spin

[01:42:51.420 --> 01:42:54.980]
While the boys in the barnyard were shoveling

[01:42:54.980 --> 01:42:58.120]
Reptucin' later from yesterday's hunt

[01:42:58.120 --> 01:43:03.240]
While the girl in the middle was rubbing her eyes at the fellow

[01:43:03.240 --> 01:43:04.980]
Down by the dock

[01:43:05.600 --> 01:43:08.920]
He looked like a man with a size of a home

[01:43:08.920 --> 01:43:11.860]
In the country with a big fence out front

[01:43:11.860 --> 01:43:16.820]
If he asked her for lightly she'd show him her little bet dog

[01:43:16.820 --> 01:43:18.620]
Who was subject to bits

[01:43:18.620 --> 01:43:23.560]
And maybe she'd let him grab hold of her small tender hands

[01:43:23.560 --> 01:43:25.400]
With a movement so quick

[01:43:25.400 --> 01:43:27.600]
And then she'd bend over

[01:43:27.600 --> 01:43:29.540]
And suck down his candy

[01:43:29.540 --> 01:43:32.240]
So tasty made of butter, sky

[01:43:32.820 --> 01:43:36.280]
And then he spread wood cream all over her cookies

[01:43:36.280 --> 01:43:39.060]
That she had left out on her shelf

[01:43:39.060 --> 01:43:43.020]
If you think this is dirty you can go f*** yourself

[01:43:49.560 --> 01:43:51.600]
It's 30 a day plus gas

[01:43:51.600 --> 01:43:53.820]
Well I ran in Lincoln

[01:43:54.820 --> 01:43:57.440]
Cash or credit I drove up in the hill

[01:43:57.440 --> 01:43:58.260]
You want me insurance?

[01:43:58.700 --> 01:44:03.140]
And to recall how it happened, well it's good luck

[01:44:03.140 --> 01:44:05.140]
It still gives me change

[01:44:05.140 --> 01:44:06.560]
What a weirdo

[01:44:06.560 --> 01:44:09.700]
Followed my map of star how sales

[01:44:09.700 --> 01:44:12.580]
And was shot to sea

[01:44:13.580 --> 01:44:16.960]
Sitting on her front porch was

[01:44:17.580 --> 01:44:20.560]
Angelina Jollin

[01:44:20.560 --> 01:44:23.020]
La la la la la la la la

[01:44:23.020 --> 01:44:25.680]
When I walked up like I knew her

[01:44:25.680 --> 01:44:28.680]
And I saw her hesitate

[01:44:29.580 --> 01:44:34.320]
But the chloro bond started working then for her

[01:44:34.320 --> 01:44:36.400]
It was too late

[01:44:37.380 --> 01:44:40.000]
Put her in my car

[01:44:41.020 --> 01:44:44.300]
Roll the windows down

[01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:48.200]
Now she watched my queen and

[01:44:48.200 --> 01:44:51.460]
I made her crown

[01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.580]
Could this stupid chloro's me

[01:44:54.580 --> 01:44:58.000]
And I've got Angelina Jollin

[01:44:58.640 --> 01:44:59.840]
In my basement

[01:45:01.320 --> 01:45:05.480]
And I think I'll keep her there with me

[01:45:05.480 --> 01:45:05.860]
Hello

[01:45:05.860 --> 01:45:07.960]
And charge her red

[01:45:07.960 --> 01:45:10.740]
I can't rent well I hope she don't mind

[01:45:10.740 --> 01:45:15.140]
I hope that she'll find that she likes the cement

[01:45:15.960 --> 01:45:17.640]
I think I'm ready for that

[01:45:17.640 --> 01:45:21.200]
How wonderful life is

[01:45:21.200 --> 01:45:24.220]
With Angelina Jollin in my basement

[01:45:25.180 --> 01:45:27.400]

But I bet you'd give your lesson

[01:45:33.700 --> 01:45:35.960]
Help me

Locked down in your basement

[01:45:49.260 --> 01:45:50.920]

[01:47:30.680 --> 01:47:31.660]
Merb Griffin 22

[01:47:31.660 --> 01:47:32.400]
Same thing

[01:47:32.400 --> 01:47:34.400]
Tenney Fane met Mr. 21

[01:47:34.400 --> 01:47:35.480]
Bill Walsh 20

[01:47:35.480 --> 01:47:36.820]
I'm just doing the double digit ones

[01:47:37.420 --> 01:47:38.220]
Brad Delph 18

[01:47:38.220 --> 01:47:39.060]
Art Buckwell 18

[01:47:39.060 --> 01:47:40.080]
Robert Crowley 17

[01:47:40.080 --> 01:47:41.380]
Ivonda Carlo 15

[01:47:41.380 --> 01:47:42.520]
Dave Halberstam 13

[01:47:42.520 --> 01:47:43.320]
Who'd you vote for?

[01:47:44.160 --> 01:47:45.180]
Molly Ivan's

[01:47:45.180 --> 01:47:45.640]
No

[01:47:46.420 --> 01:47:47.460]
I voted for Oumb

[01:47:47.460 --> 01:47:49.100]
Father Dryans got four now

[01:47:49.100 --> 01:47:49.980]
Thank God

[01:47:49.980 --> 01:47:51.760]
If there's at least three other people out there

[01:47:51.760 --> 01:47:54.340]
Remember the great Father Robert Dryans from Massachusetts

[01:47:54.340 --> 01:47:56.760]
A two police

[01:47:57.460 --> 01:47:59.340]
The biggest name

[01:47:59.340 --> 01:48:00.740]
The best out of two

[01:48:00.740 --> 01:48:01.940]
He's no Roger's

[01:48:01.940 --> 01:48:04.120]
Fortress, you're five sixty two am

[01:48:04.120 --> 01:48:05.980]
The fourth leader

[01:48:05.980 --> 01:48:08.680]
It's Friday, you bastard

[01:48:14.260 --> 01:48:16.040]
I'm dying out of here

[01:48:17.660 --> 01:48:18.960]
You fairy

[01:48:46.040 --> 01:48:47.020]
I'm not doing it

[01:48:51.760 --> 01:48:54.560]
If you've got soldiers on a towel

[01:48:54.560 --> 01:48:58.000]
The talent is moving out

[01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:02.540]
And buddy, it's thanks to the upstead eyes

[01:49:03.480 --> 01:49:05.240]
Oh, I'm getting out

[01:49:19.480 --> 01:49:35.220]
I'm getting out of here

[01:49:35.240 --> 01:50:01.380]
I'm getting out of here

[01:50:01.380 --> 01:50:05.120]
I'm getting out of here

[01:50:05.120 --> 01:50:05.220]
I'm getting out of here

[01:50:05.220 --> 01:50:05.220]

[01:50:05.220 --> 01:50:05.220]

[01:50:05.220 --> 01:50:05.220]

[01:50:05.220 --> 01:50:05.220]

[01:50:05.220 --> 01:50:05.220]

[01:50:05.220 --> 01:50:05.220]

[01:50:05.220 --> 01:50:05.220]

[01:50:05.220 --> 01:50:05.220]

[01:50:05.220 --> 01:50:05.220]

[01:50:05.220 --> 01:50:05.220]

[01:50:05.220 --> 01:50:05.220]

[01:50:20.700 --> 01:50:21.240]
I'm getting out of here

[01:50:21.240 --> 01:50:22.160]
What's the problem officer?

[01:50:22.440 --> 01:50:23.380]
Deploy from the vehicle

[01:50:23.380 --> 01:50:25.320]
I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine

[01:50:25.320 --> 01:50:28.260]
If you're God driving without a seatbelt

[01:50:28.260 --> 01:50:30.980]
You will be removed from your car and shot

[01:50:31.980 --> 01:50:36.400]
The police now have the authority to enforce seatbelt safety under the new Patriot Act 2

[01:50:36.400 --> 01:50:38.320]
The new laws in effect now

[01:50:38.320 --> 01:50:40.540]
So click it or be shot

[01:50:40.540 --> 01:50:42.740]
Officers don't like doing this

[01:50:42.740 --> 01:50:44.660]
They are only following orders

[01:50:44.660 --> 01:50:48.560]
It's for your own protection in the never ending fight against terrorism

[01:50:48.560 --> 01:50:50.940]
Terrorists act such as mouth noise

[01:50:51.940 --> 01:50:54.100]
Curp and fighting

[01:50:54.100 --> 01:50:55.980]
But be annoying to others

[01:50:55.980 --> 01:50:57.620]
So under Patriot Act 2

[01:50:57.620 --> 01:51:00.100]
Eating will no longer be permitted in restaurants

[01:51:00.620 --> 01:51:04.980]
Anyone eating outside the designated eating area will also be shot

[01:51:05.880 --> 01:51:07.400]
It's the law

[01:51:07.400 --> 01:51:09.880]
We like saying that

[01:51:09.880 --> 01:51:10.640]
The law

[01:51:10.640 --> 01:51:12.500]
The law

[01:51:12.500 --> 01:51:14.800]
The law

[01:51:14.800 --> 01:51:16.420]
It's the law

[01:51:28.620 --> 01:51:29.920]
Turn 28

[01:51:30.620 --> 01:51:33.100]
He scored the sweetest bag

[01:51:33.620 --> 01:51:35.940]
I'll go on the next day

[01:51:36.620 --> 01:51:39.100]
It's too many seats

[01:51:39.620 --> 01:51:41.780]
In your dime bag

[01:51:42.620 --> 01:51:44.400]
Getting to the party

[01:51:44.400 --> 01:51:46.620]
Two minutes too late

[01:51:47.620 --> 01:51:48.740]
Isn't it the chronic?

[01:51:50.180 --> 01:51:51.520]
Don't you think?

[01:51:52.720 --> 01:51:54.000]
It's not 38

[01:51:55.600 --> 01:51:58.000]
When your last phone break

[01:51:58.520 --> 01:52:00.460]
The free bag

[01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:04.260]
When you're already safe

[01:52:04.260 --> 01:52:07.120]
The food we eat

[01:52:07.120 --> 01:52:09.040]
That's you just kidding

[01:52:09.040 --> 01:52:09.800]
You take

[01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:12.020]
Who are you?

[01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.860]
You get it

[01:52:15.860 --> 01:52:18.320]
Hard-crowning

[01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:20.700]
That's you already ate

[01:52:20.700 --> 01:52:24.220]
A nose-drawnest sign

[01:52:24.220 --> 01:52:26.660]
A law that you break

[01:52:27.700 --> 01:52:29.920]
It's like 10,000 joints

[01:52:29.920 --> 01:52:32.440]
When all you need is a light

[01:52:32.440 --> 01:52:35.480]
It's like having the feel of your dreams

[01:52:35.480 --> 01:52:38.320]
And then fighting out these fast-tender lights

[01:52:39.340 --> 01:52:41.200]
And there's a need for chronic

[01:52:42.820 --> 01:52:43.960]
Don't you think?

[01:52:45.060 --> 01:52:47.620]
A little too much chronic

[01:52:48.620 --> 01:52:50.580]
Yeah, I really do think

[01:52:50.580 --> 01:52:52.220]
It's not 38

[01:52:53.800 --> 01:52:56.700]
When your last phone break

[01:52:56.700 --> 01:52:58.300]
The free bag

[01:52:59.520 --> 01:53:02.520]
When you're already safe

[01:53:02.520 --> 01:53:05.340]
The food we eat

[01:53:05.340 --> 01:53:07.240]
That's you just kidding

[01:53:07.240 --> 01:53:08.040]
You take

[01:53:08.620 --> 01:53:10.180]
Who are you?

[01:53:10.500 --> 01:53:13.820]
You get it

[01:53:15.340 --> 01:53:19.480]
Now a phone conversation between Queen Elizabeth and the heir apparent

[01:53:19.480 --> 01:53:21.280]
Her son, Prince Charles

[01:53:23.420 --> 01:53:23.980]
Hello

[01:53:24.820 --> 01:53:25.740]
Hello Charles

[01:53:27.540 --> 01:53:28.320]
It's mom

[01:53:29.560 --> 01:53:30.120]
Mom

[01:53:30.960 --> 01:53:32.920]
What are you calling for again, mom?

[01:53:34.260 --> 01:53:35.780]
I'm worried about you Charles

[01:53:35.780 --> 01:53:38.460]
Mom, you can't keep calling me every day

[01:53:39.740 --> 01:53:43.120]
I'm very worried you can call me like 10 times a day, mom

[01:53:43.120 --> 01:53:46.060]
I've been handed the newspaper here

[01:53:46.060 --> 01:53:47.420]
The Daily Mirror?

[01:53:47.660 --> 01:53:47.840]
Yes

[01:53:47.840 --> 01:53:49.580]
I don't read such rubbish

[01:53:50.440 --> 01:53:52.980]
Well, did you happen to see the front page?

[01:53:53.100 --> 01:53:55.980]
I didn't see it, mom, I don't read such rubbish, I've told you

[01:53:55.980 --> 01:53:58.600]
It says it's Charles bisexual

[01:54:02.660 --> 01:54:03.440]
Okay, what?

[01:54:04.020 --> 01:54:05.160]
It's true, Charles

[01:54:05.160 --> 01:54:06.120]
What is the same, mom?

[01:54:06.440 --> 01:54:08.560]
It's Charles bisexual

[01:54:11.940 --> 01:54:13.200]
What's the mean by that, mom?

[01:54:14.480 --> 01:54:18.580]
It means you like the lassies and the lads

[01:54:19.340 --> 01:54:21.220]
I don't like the lads, mom

[01:54:23.200 --> 01:54:24.040]
Don't cry, mom

[01:54:24.040 --> 01:54:25.620]
It's true, isn't it?

[01:54:25.700 --> 01:54:26.740]
Please don't cry, mom

[01:54:26.740 --> 01:54:27.420]
It's true

[01:54:27.420 --> 01:54:28.520]
It's not true

[01:54:28.520 --> 01:54:32.720]
I know I should have thought someone wrong when I called you listening to Clay-Aid

[01:54:33.460 --> 01:54:35.320]
I like him, mom, he's a good singer

[01:54:35.320 --> 01:54:38.140]
I mean, that's all there is to it

[01:54:38.140 --> 01:54:41.260]
And all those Barbara Strays and movies are not connected out

[01:54:41.260 --> 01:54:43.100]
I love to hear it, mom

[01:54:43.100 --> 01:54:44.920]
That doesn't make me buy

[01:54:46.980 --> 01:54:47.720]
How's Harry?

[01:54:49.240 --> 01:54:49.960]
Harry's fine

[01:54:49.960 --> 01:54:50.540]
With it?

[01:54:50.820 --> 01:54:52.480]
Watching him shower right now

[01:54:54.940 --> 01:54:56.260]
Where are you crying, mom?

[01:54:56.880 --> 01:54:58.440]
It's true, isn't it?

[01:54:58.660 --> 01:54:59.680]
What? It's true?

[01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:00.960]
It's not true

[01:55:02.180 --> 01:55:04.200]
You're my sex, you're my...

[01:55:04.200 --> 01:55:06.700]
I am not by sex, you are

[01:55:06.700 --> 01:55:10.480]
I don't have any sex, the woman I'm dating, mom, looks like a horse

[01:55:11.220 --> 01:55:14.300]
I mean, she doesn't give it to me at all, you know that

[01:55:14.300 --> 01:55:16.500]
Is that why you go for the men?

[01:55:16.860 --> 01:55:19.160]
I don't go for the men, mom

[01:55:19.700 --> 01:55:20.580]
So it's not true?

[01:55:21.140 --> 01:55:22.780]
I'm going to be the king of England

[01:55:23.720 --> 01:55:25.700]
Yes, that should have worried about

[01:55:25.700 --> 01:55:27.400]
Or are you worried, mom?

[01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:30.480]
You're being a king and a queen

[01:55:32.480 --> 01:55:35.700]
I can't continue this conversation any longer, mom

[01:55:36.860 --> 01:55:39.360]
All right, my date's here

[01:55:39.360 --> 01:55:40.280]
Your date?

[01:55:40.900 --> 01:55:41.320]
The committer?

[01:55:41.720 --> 01:55:42.440]
Come on in, Ernie

[01:55:42.440 --> 01:55:43.840]
Who is that?

[01:55:44.680 --> 01:55:45.920]
I... just a friend

[01:55:45.920 --> 01:55:46.980]
Is that committer?

[01:55:47.540 --> 01:55:48.120]
It's Ernie

[01:55:48.120 --> 01:55:49.700]
Ernie, who's Ernie?

[01:55:50.240 --> 01:55:51.300]
My friend Ernie

[01:55:51.300 --> 01:55:52.900]
Who is Ernie?

[01:55:53.420 --> 01:55:55.180]
We play football together, mom

[01:55:55.180 --> 01:55:56.700]
You don't play football, mom

[01:55:57.800 --> 01:56:00.280]
We play games together, mom

[01:56:00.280 --> 01:56:01.960]
I've got to go and have them

[01:56:04.420 --> 01:56:05.420]
Stop crying

[01:56:05.420 --> 01:56:06.580]
Stop crying

[01:56:07.560 --> 01:56:10.000]
Just amazes me how the queen sounds so much like that

[01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:11.220]
Right away, bride, you know what?

[01:56:11.480 --> 01:56:12.020]
Mm-hmm

[01:56:12.020 --> 01:56:13.620]
Well, you know, birds are a feather

[01:56:14.200 --> 01:56:15.520]
He's got a croak one of these days

[01:56:15.520 --> 01:56:16.680]
Then he's going to be the queen

[01:56:16.680 --> 01:56:18.540]
Sure, he's a real, he's...

[01:56:18.540 --> 01:56:19.260]
Yeah, yeah

[01:56:19.260 --> 01:56:20.020]
Screamer

[01:56:20.780 --> 01:56:23.340]
Anyway, we have 922 votes on Chris' pool

[01:56:23.340 --> 01:56:25.540]
He is pleased as punch because he knows

[01:56:26.080 --> 01:56:28.120]
That we're going to make the thousand, don't you, sir?

[01:56:28.400 --> 01:56:28.540]
Yup

[01:56:29.200 --> 01:56:31.320]
Nobody knows the trouble we've seen

[01:56:31.320 --> 01:56:32.860]
Believe me, we know the trouble

[01:56:33.680 --> 01:56:34.940]
Oh, my, do we know

[01:56:34.940 --> 01:56:36.940]
Thank God that it's not just Friday

[01:56:37.320 --> 01:56:38.700]
But it's a Christmas Friday

[01:56:38.700 --> 01:56:40.680]
We can just screw off here most of the day

[01:56:40.680 --> 01:56:42.700]
And then Monday when I'm going to screw off all day

[01:56:44.200 --> 01:56:45.480]
Although after after they were

[01:56:45.480 --> 01:56:46.900]
Am I going to have leftover to play on Monday?

[01:56:47.620 --> 01:56:47.980]
Right

[01:56:47.980 --> 01:56:49.840]
It's the same stuff

[01:56:49.840 --> 01:56:51.980]
Maybe I'll spin some wax

[01:56:53.200 --> 01:56:54.340]
Yeah, let's spin some wax

[01:56:54.340 --> 01:56:55.620]
They got all those great...

[01:56:55.620 --> 01:56:55.820]
Huh?

[01:56:56.120 --> 01:56:57.220]
All these jingles

[01:56:57.640 --> 01:56:59.600]
Yeah, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, like this one

[01:56:59.600 --> 01:57:01.620]
The big H

[01:57:01.620 --> 01:57:02.500]
Golden

[01:57:02.500 --> 01:57:03.440]
Or

[01:57:03.440 --> 01:57:05.160]
CKLW

[01:57:05.160 --> 01:57:06.400]
Golden

[01:57:06.400 --> 01:57:07.220]
Like that

[01:57:07.220 --> 01:57:07.860]
Or

[01:57:12.900 --> 01:57:14.040]
77WNDC

[01:57:15.520 --> 01:57:18.780]
Turn to gold

[01:57:21.600 --> 01:57:24.000]
And there's a Monday to end, turn to gold

[01:57:27.920 --> 01:57:29.120]
You hear that when I'm sure

[01:57:29.800 --> 01:57:32.220]
Golden and Moldy, and then there's always this one

[01:57:32.220 --> 01:57:34.940]
You're the biggest name to the best talent

[01:57:34.940 --> 01:57:36.220]
You know his new projects

[01:57:36.220 --> 01:57:38.000]
4.560 QAM

[01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:40.480]
The fourth leader

[01:57:40.480 --> 01:57:42.620]
Hey, you best, dude

[01:57:42.620 --> 01:57:43.040]
Oops

[01:57:43.040 --> 01:57:45.920]
Well, you got a lot of this and a lot of crap, you know how that is

[01:57:47.460 --> 01:57:48.580]
You know how that is

[01:57:48.580 --> 01:57:48.880]
I do

[01:57:49.500 --> 01:57:49.900]
Good

[01:57:49.900 --> 01:57:53.260]
Jingle bell, jingle bell, there ever stop

[01:57:53.900 --> 01:57:57.260]
You cannot find that brand new Xbox

[01:57:57.900 --> 01:58:01.260]
No one seen in control, reality is run

[01:58:01.900 --> 01:58:05.240]
Means your anger time has begun

[01:58:05.900 --> 01:58:09.320]
Jingle bell, jingle bell, there ever stop

[01:58:09.900 --> 01:58:13.420]
Microsoft's got one every kid wants

[01:58:13.420 --> 01:58:17.000]
Parents have checked that the mall's everywhere

[01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:20.800]
Now the tearing hair

[01:58:20.800 --> 01:58:23.180]
The daily hand for shelves

[01:58:23.180 --> 01:58:25.340]
Was a day from now

[01:58:25.340 --> 01:58:28.600]
They sold out right away

[01:58:28.600 --> 01:58:33.300]
Christmas day, time you'll hear your kid win

[01:58:33.300 --> 01:58:37.200]
It's a really shabby week good to date

[01:58:37.200 --> 01:58:40.860]
Sorry there, mom and dad feel like a thief

[01:58:40.860 --> 01:58:44.140]
Your kid wants this alone

[01:58:45.140 --> 01:58:49.140]
Strangle little kids, boy that would be me

[01:58:49.140 --> 01:58:51.400]
That's the way to go

[01:58:51.400 --> 01:58:53.480]
Yes, I know it goes

[01:58:54.140 --> 01:58:55.680]
Throughout a park on Xbox

[01:58:59.220 --> 01:59:02.540]
Jingle bell, jingle bell, there ever stop

[01:59:02.540 --> 01:59:10.140]
Jingle bell, jingle bell, there ever stop

[01:59:10.140 --> 01:59:12.040]
There were less at my door

[01:59:12.040 --> 01:59:14.800]
When the singing jingle bells over and over again

[01:59:14.800 --> 01:59:17.660]
Singing jingle bells over and over again

[01:59:18.720 --> 01:59:22.340]
I got a mind brain, I can't take it no more

[01:59:22.340 --> 01:59:24.140]
This is a good book, kids outside

[01:59:24.140 --> 01:59:27.780]
They're really one big pain in my behind the office

[01:59:27.780 --> 01:59:29.780]
Singing jingle bells at my door

[01:59:29.780 --> 01:59:33.220]
I say I get them a dollar, each just to go away

[01:59:33.220 --> 01:59:36.980]
Singing the jingle bells off key that just bother and leave

[01:59:36.980 --> 01:59:41.000]
Ringing my doorbell that just be in the awkward with my Christmas

[01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:44.300]
I just wish those damn carolers were going away

[01:59:44.300 --> 01:59:48.720]
Carolers said my door when the singing jingle bells over and over again

[01:59:48.720 --> 01:59:51.600]
Singing jingle bells over and over again

[01:59:52.600 --> 01:59:56.680]
I got a mind brain, I can't take it no more

[02:00:02.600 --> 02:00:04.380]
Return to Santa

[02:00:09.060 --> 02:00:12.380]
I got a sweater from my grandma

[02:00:12.380 --> 02:00:16.860]
It was pink and black

[02:00:16.860 --> 02:00:19.800]
But don't worry, be happy

[02:00:20.380 --> 02:00:23.200]
Was printed on the bench

[02:00:23.200 --> 02:00:24.480]
He wrote a pocket

[02:00:24.480 --> 02:00:26.880]
Return to Santa

[02:00:27.980 --> 02:00:30.880]
Just send me cash

[02:00:31.800 --> 02:00:34.320]
Your tank is square

[02:00:35.380 --> 02:00:38.380]
A game me or rash

[02:00:38.380 --> 02:00:42.980]
I got a fruit cake and some plant pans

[02:00:42.980 --> 02:00:45.840]
Where trip is for my nose

[02:00:46.780 --> 02:00:50.020]
Another bottle of old spice

[02:00:50.880 --> 02:00:53.260]
Ported iron holes

[02:00:53.260 --> 02:00:54.460]
He wrote a pocket

[02:00:54.460 --> 02:00:56.820]
Return to Santa

[02:00:56.820 --> 02:01:00.580]
A whole needs this junk

[02:01:00.580 --> 02:01:04.360]
But this year's Christmas

[02:01:04.360 --> 02:01:07.780]
A real Easter

[02:01:07.780 --> 02:01:09.400]
He wrote a pocket

[02:01:09.400 --> 02:01:11.760]
Return to Santa

[02:01:12.820 --> 02:01:15.700]
Don't mean into me rude

[02:01:16.940 --> 02:01:19.600]
But this Christmas

[02:01:20.820 --> 02:01:23.340]
I got scruched

[02:01:24.540 --> 02:01:26.700]
Return to Santa

[02:01:28.260 --> 02:01:30.480]
Return to Santa

[02:01:31.340 --> 02:01:32.900]
Break down the shelf

[02:01:32.900 --> 02:01:34.720]
Wear them at once

[02:01:34.720 --> 02:01:36.660]
Go to hang from trees

[02:01:36.660 --> 02:01:38.040]
And play banjo

[02:01:38.040 --> 02:01:40.740]
You got some who own a station

[02:01:40.740 --> 02:01:43.060]
On a newfangled gravy

[02:01:43.060 --> 02:01:45.740]
Oh, now as nore's

[02:01:45.740 --> 02:01:47.400]
Carolers go

[02:01:47.400 --> 02:01:50.620]
Rolly's a big city you know

[02:01:50.620 --> 02:01:53.660]
And that's where the beesleys had to go

[02:01:53.660 --> 02:01:56.140]
For Jolly Rolly Jones

[02:01:56.140 --> 02:01:59.160]
A new jam

[02:02:00.280 --> 02:02:02.500]
He'll do what he can

[02:02:02.500 --> 02:02:05.760]
Shake your hand like a friend

[02:02:06.620 --> 02:02:08.580]
Then quickly walk away

[02:02:08.580 --> 02:02:10.360]
Yes, they had jones

[02:02:10.360 --> 02:02:12.740]
Go to five-six-ohs

[02:02:12.740 --> 02:02:15.500]
With ratings and the toilet bowls

[02:02:15.500 --> 02:02:16.420]
To get those

[02:02:17.500 --> 02:02:18.980]
Blaming for the most

[02:02:18.980 --> 02:02:20.860]
An order and control

[02:02:21.500 --> 02:02:22.740]
And then so

[02:02:23.500 --> 02:02:25.000]
Jolly Rolly Joe

[02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:26.460]
A bunch of you know

[02:02:26.460 --> 02:02:28.940]
And in the note he lets move

[02:02:29.500 --> 02:02:31.320]
Go and here's what blows

[02:02:31.320 --> 02:02:33.900]
Gives Goundy his own show

[02:02:35.500 --> 02:02:37.140]
He'll make a big change

[02:02:37.140 --> 02:02:39.800]
And read a rake

[02:02:41.500 --> 02:02:42.900]
It's worse on the same

[02:02:42.900 --> 02:02:45.880]
He hasn't done a thing

[02:02:46.900 --> 02:02:49.260]
Or what goes on the air

[02:02:49.260 --> 02:02:49.960]
And two

[02:02:49.960 --> 02:02:52.780]
Joe don't have a stinkin' clue

[02:02:52.780 --> 02:02:53.840]
About a poor

[02:02:53.840 --> 02:02:56.180]
Not that essentially blows

[02:02:56.180 --> 02:02:58.120]
For all radio

[02:02:58.900 --> 02:03:00.080]
G-M

[02:03:00.080 --> 02:03:02.600]
Of five-six-ohs

[02:03:02.600 --> 02:03:04.500]
Jolly Rolly Joe

[02:03:12.900 --> 02:03:13.300]
He'll do it

[02:03:13.300 --> 02:03:16.900]
He'll do it

[02:03:21.140 --> 02:03:23.060]
He'll do it

[02:03:23.060 --> 02:03:23.900]
He'll do it

[02:03:23.900 --> 02:03:24.440]
He'll do it

[02:03:24.440 --> 02:03:25.160]
Down in Miami

[02:03:25.160 --> 02:03:26.400]
Here in a looser cell

[02:03:26.400 --> 02:03:28.720]
There's a fake bass-pastor named

[02:03:28.720 --> 02:03:29.600]
Jolly Joe

[02:03:29.600 --> 02:03:32.620]
He manages a radio station there

[02:03:32.620 --> 02:03:34.520]
And then he comes to paying bills

[02:03:34.520 --> 02:03:35.880]
Joe don't care

[02:03:37.560 --> 02:03:39.420]
That's the Joe's a fool

[02:03:39.420 --> 02:03:41.960]
I am gonna pay the love up

[02:03:41.960 --> 02:03:43.220]
Ho ho ho ho

[02:03:43.960 --> 02:03:45.180]
Debbie Debbie

[02:03:45.960 --> 02:03:46.600]
Debbie Joe

[02:03:46.600 --> 02:03:47.960]
What a show

[02:03:47.960 --> 02:03:50.300]
Ho ho ho ho

[02:03:50.300 --> 02:03:51.840]
Debbie Joe

[02:03:54.420 --> 02:03:55.920]
Joe's picked a point out

[02:03:55.920 --> 02:03:58.640]
That these lead greed has a spinging freeze

[02:03:58.640 --> 02:04:00.280]
Correct him please

[02:04:00.280 --> 02:04:03.360]
I'm not the only one who's being left with no choice

[02:04:03.360 --> 02:04:06.580]
But to live on your desk a steaming pile of joints

[02:04:08.200 --> 02:04:09.500]
Debbie Joe

[02:04:10.560 --> 02:04:14.000]
I'm not a great enough apple for my hair

[02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:14.940]
Debbie

[02:04:15.500 --> 02:04:17.220]
Debbie Joe

[02:04:17.220 --> 02:04:18.160]
Ho ho ho

[02:04:18.160 --> 02:04:19.440]
Debbie Joe

[02:04:19.440 --> 02:04:22.380]
Debbie Joe

[02:04:24.280 --> 02:04:27.720]
I'm looking forward to seeing Debbie Joe

[02:04:27.720 --> 02:04:29.240]
On the corner of the job

[02:04:29.240 --> 02:04:30.820]
And Paul Metal Park Road

[02:04:31.500 --> 02:04:32.460]
Walking through the traffic

[02:04:32.460 --> 02:04:34.440]
With a cardboard sign that says

[02:04:34.440 --> 02:04:35.380]
Oh, that'd be fun!

[02:04:35.380 --> 02:04:36.840]
Can you smirm me a dime?

[02:04:37.060 --> 02:04:38.700]
Ho ho ho ho ho

[02:04:38.700 --> 02:04:39.080]
Debbie Joe

[02:04:39.080 --> 02:04:43.220]
You got to get your stuff

[02:04:43.220 --> 02:04:44.440]
Ho ho ho ho

[02:04:45.380 --> 02:04:46.300]
Debbie Debbie

[02:04:46.300 --> 02:04:48.240]
I got to pay the love up

[02:04:48.240 --> 02:04:51.680]
Ho ho ho

[02:04:51.680 --> 02:04:53.000]
Debbie Joe

[02:04:54.140 --> 02:04:55.300]
You blow

[02:04:55.300 --> 02:04:57.420]
What biggest name?

[02:04:57.680 --> 02:04:59.820]
The best talent to make his new Rogers

[02:04:59.820 --> 02:05:02.320]
4.560 QAM

[02:05:02.320 --> 02:05:04.100]
The fourth leader

[02:05:04.100 --> 02:05:05.700]
And to two hours

[02:05:07.360 --> 02:05:10.360]
Don't let me tell you don't bother me while I'm in here

[02:05:10.360 --> 02:05:10.840]
I sir

[02:05:12.100 --> 02:05:12.160]
Hello

[02:05:12.160 --> 02:05:13.680]
It's Mickey Mouse

[02:05:13.680 --> 02:05:16.880]
Oh Mr. Mouse good morning how are you?

[02:05:17.200 --> 02:05:19.820]
What the hell are you doing to me?

[02:05:20.580 --> 02:05:21.460]
Nothing sir

[02:05:21.460 --> 02:05:23.220]
You're freaking telling me

[02:05:23.220 --> 02:05:24.000]
No, I'm not

[02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:26.520]
I got David Kelly calling me every three minutes

[02:05:26.520 --> 02:05:29.020]
Why did we move the process?

[02:05:29.380 --> 02:05:30.940]
Sir, you told me to move the bride

[02:05:30.940 --> 02:05:33.580]
I didn't tell you when you must have misunderstood me

[02:05:33.580 --> 02:05:36.740]
No sir, you said move the practice to Monday

[02:05:36.740 --> 02:05:38.600]
Hey, listen but wife

[02:05:38.600 --> 02:05:40.940]
I'm the boss, I make the decisions

[02:05:40.940 --> 02:05:42.240]
You take the heat

[02:05:42.940 --> 02:05:44.380]
You move the practice

[02:05:45.020 --> 02:05:46.900]
How are we going with it anyway?

[02:05:46.940 --> 02:05:48.340]
I am mad

[02:05:48.340 --> 02:05:49.900]
Hold on, we're ready

[02:05:49.900 --> 02:05:50.700]
We must

[02:05:52.940 --> 02:05:54.540]
Shut the hell up

[02:05:54.540 --> 02:05:56.280]
I'm on the phone, we must

[02:05:56.280 --> 02:05:57.100]
Hi there!

[02:05:57.100 --> 02:05:58.960]
Yes sir, what was your question?

[02:05:59.260 --> 02:06:01.940]
I'm calling you, I'm going crazy over here

[02:06:01.940 --> 02:06:06.260]
Between David Kelly and now Michael Jackson calling me every three minutes

[02:06:06.260 --> 02:06:08.600]
I'm going to go out of my freaking mind

[02:06:09.680 --> 02:06:10.720]
Hold on

[02:06:10.720 --> 02:06:13.360]
We must get here you both

[02:06:13.360 --> 02:06:14.660]
Stop it, we must

[02:06:15.400 --> 02:06:16.840]
I'm going to slow it, slow it

[02:06:16.840 --> 02:06:18.800]
Stop going to slow it, we must

[02:06:19.500 --> 02:06:20.400]
We must

[02:06:21.100 --> 02:06:22.900]
If it wasn't to my hand, we must

[02:06:22.900 --> 02:06:24.380]
That's your penis, both

[02:06:24.380 --> 02:06:26.000]
My other hand, Remus

[02:06:26.760 --> 02:06:28.120]
That's the phone boss

[02:06:28.120 --> 02:06:32.300]
Right, I can't hear anything, we must stop slowing the floor

[02:06:32.300 --> 02:06:33.880]
Sorry, sorry

[02:06:33.880 --> 02:06:36.600]
The moves are working out very well

[02:06:36.600 --> 02:06:39.320]
The practice is 4th and it's time for us

[02:06:39.320 --> 02:06:40.780]
What, you get time for us

[02:06:40.780 --> 02:06:42.380]
Christ, are we even beating the WB?

[02:06:43.420 --> 02:06:43.880]
Barely

[02:06:43.880 --> 02:06:45.300]
Oh my god

[02:06:45.300 --> 02:06:47.580]
Michael Jackson was a rating success

[02:06:47.580 --> 02:06:50.240]
Of course, hold on a second

[02:06:51.400 --> 02:06:52.040]
Remus

[02:06:54.740 --> 02:06:58.140]
What's the hell you're doing with a harmonica reading?

[02:06:59.080 --> 02:07:02.120]
Don't play it, Remus, I'll jam the thing down your throat

[02:07:02.120 --> 02:07:04.740]
Get that blue bird away from me

[02:07:04.740 --> 02:07:06.180]
Oh, come on, Bluebird

[02:07:06.780 --> 02:07:07.780]
I'm allergic

[02:07:07.780 --> 02:07:09.100]
Eyes are

[02:07:09.100 --> 02:07:11.540]
Sir, over 25 million people

[02:07:11.540 --> 02:07:13.660]
Stop it, Pfizer, listen

[02:07:13.660 --> 02:07:16.000]
You see me what I'm doing here

[02:07:16.720 --> 02:07:17.820]
Sir, you're on the phone

[02:07:17.820 --> 02:07:19.900]
I know I'm on the phone

[02:07:19.900 --> 02:07:21.060]
Do you see what I'm doing?

[02:07:21.560 --> 02:07:23.920]
You hear imagination for crying out loud

[02:07:24.580 --> 02:07:26.300]
I'm moving my hands up and down

[02:07:26.300 --> 02:07:28.120]
Slide to side, I'm the puppet master

[02:07:28.680 --> 02:07:30.480]
Eyes were hands, you do it

[02:07:30.480 --> 02:07:32.540]
Now Fox is gonna air over something

[02:07:32.540 --> 02:07:34.720]
You cut out all the Michael Jackson interview

[02:07:35.460 --> 02:07:39.140]
But sir, you told me to edit out all that stuff to make him work with you

[02:07:39.140 --> 02:07:39.840]
Stop, stop, stop, stop

[02:07:40.400 --> 02:07:42.100]
Puppet master, me

[02:07:43.260 --> 02:07:43.720]
Idiot

[02:07:44.400 --> 02:07:44.860]
Oh

[02:07:49.200 --> 02:07:49.760]
Oh

[02:07:49.760 --> 02:07:49.760]

[02:07:49.760 --> 02:07:50.420]
Remus

[02:07:50.420 --> 02:07:53.540]
Yes, yes, yes, stop the hell you're doing now

[02:07:53.540 --> 02:07:54.780]
Listen to blow a blow

[02:07:54.780 --> 02:07:56.740]
It's nothing wrong with the floor, Remus

[02:07:56.740 --> 02:07:57.920]
What's this in my ear?

[02:07:58.300 --> 02:07:59.500]
That's your penis, boss

[02:07:59.500 --> 02:08:01.180]
My other ear, Remus

[02:08:01.180 --> 02:08:03.060]
At the phone, boss

[02:08:03.060 --> 02:08:05.960]
Get out, get over the word

[02:08:05.960 --> 02:08:06.780]
Get out

[02:08:06.780 --> 02:08:07.800]
Hi, sir

[02:08:07.800 --> 02:08:11.620]
I'm sorry, sir

[02:08:11.620 --> 02:08:12.600]
Kill me

[02:08:13.620 --> 02:08:14.860]
Kill me softly

[02:08:14.860 --> 02:08:16.000]
I'm sorry

[02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:17.480]

[02:08:32.540 --> 02:08:35.840]
I'm sorry

[02:08:35.840 --> 02:08:37.040]
I'm sorry

[02:08:37.040 --> 02:08:37.940]
Let's go

[02:08:38.860 --> 02:08:40.020]
Let's go

[02:08:40.860 --> 02:08:41.760]
Let's go

[02:08:41.760 --> 02:08:42.960]
Let's go

[02:08:42.960 --> 02:08:44.540]
Let's go

[02:08:45.760 --> 02:08:46.580]
Let's go

[02:08:46.580 --> 02:08:47.620]
Oh, smashing

What the hell was that?

[02:09:06.220 --> 02:09:06.480]
I don't know

[02:09:06.480 --> 02:09:07.300]
What did he do?

[02:09:07.300 --> 02:09:07.820]
He's in white

[02:09:07.820 --> 02:09:09.520]
I don't know

[02:09:09.520 --> 02:09:11.420]
What did he do in here?

[02:09:11.860 --> 02:09:14.560]
I pulled my open

[02:09:14.560 --> 02:09:16.340]
And dressed up like Chinese Steven

[02:09:16.340 --> 02:09:17.500]
That's for you

[02:09:17.500 --> 02:09:19.180]
You're supposed to be the dude

[02:09:19.980 --> 02:09:21.840]
How about a nice Hawaiian punch?

[02:09:22.060 --> 02:09:22.520]
Sure

[02:09:25.240 --> 02:09:26.080]
Oh

[02:09:26.080 --> 02:09:26.220]

[02:09:26.340 --> 02:09:27.700]
I don't know

[02:09:30.620 --> 02:09:32.840]
I don't know

[02:09:36.260 --> 02:09:37.720]
So how do you do it?

[02:09:37.720 --> 02:09:37.720]

[02:09:37.720 --> 02:09:38.240]

[02:10:50.920 --> 02:10:55.340]
No. But you do not pour. I didn't like that question. I'll

[02:10:55.340 --> 02:10:58.920]
rephrase it. Hey, what are you doing here? I'm with 10 states of

[02:12:28.480 --> 02:12:33.240]

[02:13:00.980 --> 02:13:11.260]
It is a new contract extension for 6,000 years. Oh, for $6,000 and one cat-line.

[02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:20.540]
Okay, let's see what we have here for. Oh, look, this is for George. Now for George, I have a look.

[02:13:21.580 --> 02:13:32.000]
Somewhere here. Oh, that's not it. Oh, here it is. This is a token of my concern. Just press the button here.

[02:13:32.600 --> 02:13:39.200]
Are you okay? Are you all right? Is there anything I can't do for you?

Oh, and last but very least. I didn't forget you, Boca. Here is your... It's... I... I just don't know what to tell you.

And I take it over with that view instead of that view.

[02:15:10.720 --> 02:15:13.160]
He's got a lot of time to talk about me and I'll write you.

[02:15:13.580 --> 02:15:16.080]
I don't give a brat what that fairy has to say.

[02:15:16.600 --> 02:15:18.720]
If he wants to smoke things to God, then what?

[02:15:20.360 --> 02:15:21.440]
I'll have you know.

[02:15:21.800 --> 02:15:22.940]
I know what I'm talking about.

[02:15:23.380 --> 02:15:25.780]
Every morning at the condo, I take the elevator down.

[02:15:26.020 --> 02:15:28.640]
And on my way to the car when I told my children to bask it out,

[02:15:28.900 --> 02:15:30.420]
I give a free condo paper.

[02:15:31.480 --> 02:15:33.260]
The toys are back in town.

[02:15:33.480 --> 02:15:34.740]
The toys are back in town.

[02:15:34.740 --> 02:15:39.360]
The toys are back in town.

[02:15:40.060 --> 02:15:42.320]
The toys are back in the town.

[02:15:43.100 --> 02:15:44.000]
The toys are back in town.

[02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:45.900]
The toys are back in town.

[02:15:46.200 --> 02:15:47.680]
The toys are back in town.

[02:15:47.680 --> 02:15:53.320]
The toys are back in town.

[02:15:55.620 --> 02:15:57.540]
The toys are back in town.

[02:15:58.920 --> 02:16:01.280]
I've shut the toys of back in town.

[02:16:01.700 --> 02:16:02.740]
Why you lose?

[02:16:07.140 --> 02:16:09.520]
I know everything is going on in that news.

[02:16:10.100 --> 02:16:12.720]
Why I even know all the no-majot rules.

[02:16:13.040 --> 02:16:14.080]
I'm hip to the drive.

[02:16:14.420 --> 02:16:15.200]
Daddy, I'll lose you.

[02:16:16.040 --> 02:16:21.300]
You better go a doctor like it's the better show when I take your place.

[02:16:21.860 --> 02:16:23.720]
I know I ain't no way for you, baby.

[02:16:24.300 --> 02:16:26.460]
But when they drop my voice, we'll change.

[02:16:26.460 --> 02:16:29.640]
You little smoothies, you little boys, you little boys.

[02:16:29.640 --> 02:16:32.840]
You little boys, you little boys, you little boys.

[02:16:34.260 --> 02:16:42.340]
You little boys, you little boys.

[02:16:42.340 --> 02:16:44.180]
So how do you like that, baby?

[02:16:44.300 --> 02:16:47.620]
I'm breaking through the $5 barrier on the downside, $4.99.

[02:16:48.320 --> 02:16:49.280]
I'm sure they can do better.

[02:16:50.120 --> 02:16:51.080]
Are you hurtin'?

[02:16:51.080 --> 02:16:51.820]
I'm sure they can do better.

[02:16:52.720 --> 02:16:53.760]
953 votes on the poll.

[02:16:53.900 --> 02:16:54.660]
We need to do better than that.

[02:16:54.740 --> 02:16:59.300]
We need to get to a thousand by two o'clock, or Chris is going to be really pealed for the holidays, ain't ya?

[02:17:00.960 --> 02:17:01.840]
Ah, that's not really.

[02:17:02.480 --> 02:17:05.780]
You're going to see, you're going to use psychology, man.

[02:17:05.880 --> 02:17:06.660]
I'll say not really.

[02:17:06.980 --> 02:17:09.760]
I'm going to be so down if that was a thousand.

[02:17:10.420 --> 02:17:10.460]
Chris?

[02:17:10.460 --> 02:17:11.700]
Yeah, that's a broken man.

[02:17:13.040 --> 02:17:14.120]
Now that's when we leave.

[02:17:15.260 --> 02:17:18.840]
9.53, which celebrity death of 2007 was saddest to you?

[02:17:19.140 --> 02:17:20.820]
None of these, 225 deaths.

[02:17:20.820 --> 02:17:23.720]
That is so insensitive and just rotten to the core.

[02:17:24.220 --> 02:17:25.800]
None of these, 225.

[02:17:25.920 --> 02:17:26.920]
I didn't care about any of these people.

[02:17:27.200 --> 02:17:30.020]
And it's a long list, and some of them are like, you know, almost human.

[02:17:31.180 --> 02:17:34.480]
Molly Ivins, 106, Kurt Vodaget, Jr. 58.

[02:17:35.580 --> 02:17:36.540]

And we were all in the same place.

[02:22:40.580 --> 02:22:51.640]
And we were all correct.

[02:22:51.640 --> 02:22:53.060]
And we were all in heaven where we were all in heaven.

[02:31:08.740 --> 02:31:09.900]
The next day

[02:31:09.900 --> 02:31:13.260]
All 276 members of the studio audience

[02:31:13.260 --> 02:31:15.580]
Get a three-foot helper monkey

[02:31:15.580 --> 02:31:18.720]
Everybody gets a three-foot helper monkey

[02:31:18.720 --> 02:31:21.980]
Everybody gets a three-foot helper monkey

[02:31:21.980 --> 02:31:22.780]
The next day

[02:31:22.780 --> 02:31:26.480]
All 276 audience members get a new prosthetic arm

[02:31:26.480 --> 02:31:28.760]
Everybody gets a breast area

[02:31:28.760 --> 02:31:31.200]
I'm a woman in the prosthetic arm

[02:31:31.200 --> 02:31:33.260]
Oprah giving away great stuff

[02:31:33.260 --> 02:31:34.440]
She didn't have to pay for it

[02:31:34.440 --> 02:31:35.780]
Even though she could easily afford to

[02:31:35.780 --> 02:31:36.580]
And next season

[02:31:36.580 --> 02:31:39.380]
Everybody in the studio audience gets a stedman

[02:31:39.380 --> 02:31:41.600]
Everybody gets a stedman

[02:31:41.600 --> 02:31:44.940]
Everybody gets a stedman

[02:31:44.940 --> 02:31:46.320]
Now, inside addition

[02:31:46.320 --> 02:31:50.460]
Oprah Winfrey used her megawatt star power to help Barack Obama's

[02:31:50.460 --> 02:31:52.000]
Presidential campaign this weekend

[02:31:52.760 --> 02:31:56.200]
I believe that as a transgender

[02:31:56.200 --> 02:31:58.740]
that Barack Obama will bring a sense of

[02:31:58.740 --> 02:32:00.180]
States of the White House

[02:32:00.180 --> 02:32:03.720]
Barack Obama wanted to be with a man

[02:32:03.720 --> 02:32:06.060]
Winfrey said he wouldn't make a good president

[02:32:06.060 --> 02:32:07.060]
Yeah, I really like him

[02:32:07.060 --> 02:32:10.200]
He's great but maybe a little feminine on the feminine side

[02:32:10.200 --> 02:32:11.640]
Inside addition

[02:32:11.640 --> 02:32:12.560]
We'll be right back

[02:32:27.500 --> 02:32:29.860]
A lot of slipping and sliding

[02:32:29.860 --> 02:32:31.400]
We'll all fall salad

[02:32:31.400 --> 02:32:33.120]
I'm peeking and I'm having

[02:32:33.120 --> 02:32:34.520]
Duking back and down

[02:32:34.520 --> 02:32:36.100]
Don't wanna rip it

[02:32:36.100 --> 02:32:37.700]
Don't wanna dance with me

[02:32:37.700 --> 02:32:39.940]
I've got a brand new lover name

[02:32:39.940 --> 02:32:41.180]
Shout that band

[02:32:41.180 --> 02:32:43.080]
One day when I was in the middle

[02:32:43.080 --> 02:32:44.160]
And a hot breath until

[02:32:44.160 --> 02:32:46.060]
That's where I'm never been

[02:32:46.060 --> 02:32:47.620]
And it's a shell of love

[02:32:47.620 --> 02:32:49.500]
I told her that I loved her

[02:32:49.500 --> 02:32:50.880]
I never believed

[02:32:50.880 --> 02:32:52.760]
She pulled her on the rhyming

[02:32:52.760 --> 02:32:54.400]
She gave me fever

[02:32:54.400 --> 02:32:56.020]
She's my true diffuited

[02:32:56.020 --> 02:32:57.600]
I love the child story

[02:32:57.600 --> 02:32:59.380]
She was in like a hound

[02:32:59.380 --> 02:33:00.860]
Everywhere I go

[02:33:00.860 --> 02:33:04.060]
Whenever I'm around I'm on my piece of youth

[02:33:04.880 --> 02:33:07.080]
She might step on my blue suede

[02:33:07.080 --> 02:33:08.040]
She's running on

[02:33:08.040 --> 02:33:10.560]
It's hard and just the olden night

[02:33:10.560 --> 02:33:12.440]
And I got jealous

[02:33:12.440 --> 02:33:13.740]
And she started a fight

[02:33:13.740 --> 02:33:17.260]
And because I was dancing with no eludes

[02:33:17.260 --> 02:33:18.540]
I had some hard gym

[02:33:18.540 --> 02:33:20.500]
Then it's to the rescue

[02:33:20.500 --> 02:33:22.320]
Shout that band

[02:33:22.320 --> 02:33:23.780]
And she's my heart's design

[02:33:24.540 --> 02:33:25.540]
Shout that band

[02:33:25.540 --> 02:33:27.580]
And there's no soul without you

[02:33:27.580 --> 02:33:30.440]
And we were married on the blueberry hill

[02:33:30.440 --> 02:33:32.300]
Now we so happy

[02:33:32.300 --> 02:33:33.780]
And I love her still

[02:33:53.700 --> 02:33:55.280]
She's my true diffuited

[02:33:55.280 --> 02:33:57.260]
And I love the child story

[02:33:57.260 --> 02:33:59.100]
She was in like a hound

[02:33:59.100 --> 02:34:00.560]
Everywhere I go

[02:34:00.560 --> 02:34:04.220]
Whenever I'm around I'm on my piece of youth

[02:34:04.220 --> 02:34:06.940]
She might step on my blue suede

[02:34:06.940 --> 02:34:07.900]
She's running on

[02:34:07.900 --> 02:34:10.540]
It's hard and just the olden night

[02:34:10.540 --> 02:34:12.420]
And I got jealous

[02:34:12.420 --> 02:34:13.860]
And she started a fight

[02:34:14.540 --> 02:34:16.540]
And because I was dancing with no eludes

[02:34:16.840 --> 02:34:18.640]
I had some hard gym

[02:34:18.640 --> 02:34:20.660]
Then it's to the rescue

[02:34:20.660 --> 02:34:22.440]
Shout that band

[02:34:22.440 --> 02:34:24.080]
And it's my heart's design

[02:34:24.080 --> 02:34:26.080]
And I got the kind of love and stuff

[02:34:26.080 --> 02:34:27.240]
My soul about

[02:34:27.240 --> 02:34:30.660]
Shout that band and well I love her still

[02:34:30.660 --> 02:34:33.960]
I'll never let chocolate band go

[02:34:37.100 --> 02:34:39.000]
This is a special holiday edition

[02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:40.620]
of VH1's Behind the Music

[02:34:42.560 --> 02:34:44.500]
Although they have a new movie

[02:34:44.500 --> 02:34:47.720]
The original chipmunks first appeared in the late 50s

[02:34:47.720 --> 02:34:49.240]
It all started with a hit song

[02:34:49.240 --> 02:34:50.820]
And a seemingly bright future

[02:34:50.820 --> 02:34:53.580]
But these rare session tapes tell a different story

[02:34:53.580 --> 02:34:54.240]
Okay Simon

[02:34:54.240 --> 02:34:55.680]
Okay Theodore

[02:34:55.680 --> 02:34:56.820]
Okay Alvin

[02:34:56.820 --> 02:34:57.820]
Alvin

[02:34:57.820 --> 02:35:00.760]
What the f*** is Alvin?

[02:35:00.960 --> 02:35:02.180]
He's shooting up a junk out of that

[02:35:05.700 --> 02:35:06.940]
I'm here Dave

[02:35:06.940 --> 02:35:08.540]
Alvin I'm sick of your

[02:35:08.540 --> 02:35:11.140]
Take your finger out of my face man

[02:35:11.140 --> 02:35:12.260]
Alvin got a shout out

[02:35:13.140 --> 02:35:15.420]
I'm going to get this f***

[02:35:15.420 --> 02:35:16.680]
I'm going so low

[02:35:16.680 --> 02:35:17.200]
What?

[02:35:17.720 --> 02:35:20.740]
I'm going to get out of it

[02:35:20.740 --> 02:35:23.700]
Michael O'Flanahan produced the now classic album

[02:35:23.700 --> 02:35:25.960]
A founding curled up in the lunchbox

[02:35:25.960 --> 02:35:27.800]
The thing is he could have had it all

[02:35:27.800 --> 02:35:29.960]
O'Flanahan just couldn't stop chasing the devil

[02:35:29.960 --> 02:35:33.560]
The brightest celestial object I've ever seen

[02:35:33.560 --> 02:35:34.860]
O'Flan's comet

[02:35:34.860 --> 02:35:37.340]
The chipmunks on a special holiday edition

[02:35:37.340 --> 02:35:38.680]
A VH1's

[02:35:39.340 --> 02:35:40.060]
Behind the music

[02:36:27.780 --> 02:36:33.060]
The music is a very good song

[02:36:33.060 --> 02:36:33.060]

[02:36:33.060 --> 02:36:33.060]

[02:36:33.060 --> 02:36:33.060]

[02:36:33.060 --> 02:36:33.060]

[02:36:33.060 --> 02:36:33.080]
It's a very good song

[02:36:33.080 --> 02:36:33.080]

[02:36:33.080 --> 02:36:33.120]
It's a very good song

[02:36:33.120 --> 02:36:33.120]

[02:36:33.120 --> 02:36:33.120]

[02:36:33.120 --> 02:36:33.140]
It's a very good song

[02:36:33.140 --> 02:36:33.860]
It's a very good song

[02:36:33.860 --> 02:36:34.540]
It's a very good song

[02:36:34.540 --> 02:36:36.720]
It's a very good song

[02:36:36.720 --> 02:36:38.640]
Get out the credit cards

[02:36:38.640 --> 02:36:40.080]
That just can be

[02:36:40.720 --> 02:36:42.720]
Shuffle around the clock

[02:36:44.360 --> 02:36:48.240]
If you hurry up the shipping is free

[02:36:48.240 --> 02:36:50.620]
Cause the internet

[02:36:50.620 --> 02:36:52.600]
Cause the internet

[02:36:52.600 --> 02:36:55.480]
Cause the internet around

[02:36:56.440 --> 02:36:58.480]
I'm 38, well he's Georgia

[02:36:58.480 --> 02:37:00.360]
You know, sent me a couple of little

[02:37:00.360 --> 02:37:01.520]
2Ds there on my space

[02:37:01.520 --> 02:37:03.980]
It's quiet everybody's gone don't you understand?

[02:37:03.980 --> 02:37:05.020]
I know they know more

[02:37:05.020 --> 02:37:06.680]
I really dispoenaed my friends and professors

[02:37:06.680 --> 02:37:08.040]
They were there for a little bit

[02:37:08.480 --> 02:37:10.360]
Luckily, if you're good for them I hope it's true

[02:37:10.360 --> 02:37:11.400]
They got their work done

[02:37:11.400 --> 02:37:12.980]
They shuffled a couple of papers around

[02:37:12.980 --> 02:37:14.700]
Okay I'm done and they bailed out

[02:37:14.700 --> 02:37:15.940]
Brande has a job

[02:37:17.660 --> 02:37:18.880]
Now why are you picking on him?

[02:37:18.980 --> 02:37:19.400]
I thought I would

[02:37:19.400 --> 02:37:21.020]
And speaking of Josh Cordis

[02:37:22.280 --> 02:37:23.880]
Who's gonna be doing the stories next week

[02:37:23.880 --> 02:37:25.420]
Don't tell me it's gonna be another one of these deals

[02:37:25.420 --> 02:37:26.620]
Where I'm gonna send a bunch of stories

[02:37:26.620 --> 02:37:28.880]
And to look online they're on our website

[02:37:28.880 --> 02:37:29.840]
Oh no stories

[02:37:30.540 --> 02:37:31.940]
Who's gonna be taking care of that?

[02:37:32.000 --> 02:37:32.460]
George can do it

[02:37:32.460 --> 02:37:32.980]
I don't know

[02:37:32.980 --> 02:37:34.900]
No no he does a particular thing

[02:37:35.600 --> 02:37:36.640]
That's a different story

[02:37:36.640 --> 02:37:38.200]
So I don't know

[02:37:38.200 --> 02:37:39.080]
Maybe Eric can do it

[02:37:39.080 --> 02:37:39.960]
He does a particular thing

[02:37:39.960 --> 02:37:40.420]
Oh right

[02:37:40.420 --> 02:37:42.120]
Oh see that's a serious question

[02:37:42.120 --> 02:37:44.440]
You might want to ask him that before you kick him in the face

[02:37:45.460 --> 02:37:47.580]
Who's gonna do the stories that they tell us

[02:37:47.580 --> 02:37:49.100]
Come on, there's no rejects

[02:37:49.100 --> 02:37:50.900]
I'm not gonna do it

[02:37:51.580 --> 02:37:52.620]
4.87

[02:37:53.580 --> 02:37:55.960]
Why the, you bastard

[02:38:03.580 --> 02:38:04.800]
Okay you're listening to the ticket

[02:38:05.580 --> 02:38:06.060]
Not

[02:38:06.060 --> 02:38:09.340]
Every good Christian knows it gain to play

[02:38:09.340 --> 02:38:12.360]
I did not so very hard to do

[02:38:12.360 --> 02:38:13.400]
Five the top

[02:38:13.400 --> 02:38:16.060]
The name of the game is the Bible

[02:38:16.060 --> 02:38:19.180]
But as you were hurt for it's the way we do

[02:38:19.180 --> 02:38:21.280]
Tell people you know the way

[02:38:21.280 --> 02:38:22.780]
The Bible says

[02:38:22.780 --> 02:38:24.980]
Invite them to your house

[02:38:25.980 --> 02:38:28.200]
Make their possessions away

[02:38:28.200 --> 02:38:29.920]
The Bible says

[02:38:29.920 --> 02:38:31.880]
And then you burn it down

[02:38:34.720 --> 02:38:37.520]
You can get somebody to believe in

[02:38:37.520 --> 02:38:40.860]
If you make the Bible say it's true

[02:38:41.640 --> 02:38:43.620]
No matter what you do

[02:38:43.620 --> 02:38:45.140]
You can be garried

[02:38:45.140 --> 02:38:47.720]
The Lord will always forgive you

[02:38:47.720 --> 02:38:49.760]
Think up a poison in his name

[02:38:49.760 --> 02:38:51.300]
The Bible says

[02:38:51.300 --> 02:38:53.340]
Way that all around

[02:38:53.340 --> 02:38:55.000]
The Bible says

[02:38:55.000 --> 02:38:56.660]
Find a fortune's lineage

[02:38:56.660 --> 02:38:58.540]
The Bible says

[02:38:58.540 --> 02:39:00.520]
And shoot a doctor down

[02:39:01.140 --> 02:39:03.040]
Everybody, we are all with you

[02:39:03.040 --> 02:39:03.760]
Hey

[02:39:08.120 --> 02:39:10.900]
Come on, here we go with the publics

[02:39:15.960 --> 02:39:18.280]
Be the crap out of your kids

[02:39:18.280 --> 02:39:19.860]
The Bible says

[02:39:19.860 --> 02:39:22.100]
You are due to the right of the Bible

[02:39:23.180 --> 02:39:25.280]
Go on a fair promise

[02:39:25.280 --> 02:39:27.040]
The Bible says

[02:39:27.040 --> 02:39:29.060]
And pass the play around

[02:39:29.060 --> 02:39:30.620]
The Bible says

[02:39:30.620 --> 02:39:31.760]
Find all the chickens

[02:39:31.760 --> 02:39:34.120]
And the Bible says

[02:39:34.120 --> 02:39:35.140]
You make the sacrifice

[02:39:37.380 --> 02:39:39.680]
You get the hind of it now

[02:39:39.680 --> 02:39:41.460]
The Bible says

[02:39:41.460 --> 02:39:42.860]
I'm starched up

[02:39:42.860 --> 02:39:44.420]
God gave him the right

[02:39:44.420 --> 02:39:46.020]
The Bible says

[02:39:46.020 --> 02:39:48.120]
He lends his spoken mass

[02:39:48.120 --> 02:39:49.220]
The Bible says

[02:39:50.080 --> 02:39:51.580]
He's a creepy head

[02:39:51.580 --> 02:39:53.120]
The Bible says

[02:39:55.720 --> 02:39:56.520]
He's a Bible

[02:39:56.520 --> 02:39:57.160]
Oh yeah

[02:39:57.160 --> 02:39:59.920]
Oh yeah

[02:39:59.920 --> 02:40:02.420]
Oh yeah

[02:40:03.560 --> 02:40:05.420]
Guys, I am a killer

[02:40:05.420 --> 02:40:07.240]
He didn't hide it back

[02:40:07.240 --> 02:40:09.200]
When someone gives the whole over it

[02:40:09.200 --> 02:40:10.740]
Jesus freaks out back

[02:40:10.740 --> 02:40:12.740]
Jesus Christ is super happy

[02:40:12.740 --> 02:40:14.360]
Never shut up to church

[02:40:14.360 --> 02:40:16.400]
Posing won't get thrown on the floor

[02:40:16.400 --> 02:40:17.760]
He's been choked to church

[02:40:17.760 --> 02:40:18.840]
The Bible says

[02:40:18.840 --> 02:40:21.100]
God gave him the right

[02:40:21.100 --> 02:40:22.780]
The Bible says

[02:40:22.780 --> 02:40:28.360]
He's a creepy head

[02:40:28.360 --> 02:40:29.740]
The Bible says

[02:40:29.740 --> 02:40:30.900]
He's a creepy head

[02:40:30.900 --> 02:40:31.760]
The Bible says

[02:40:32.640 --> 02:40:34.160]
Oh yeah

[02:40:34.740 --> 02:40:36.120]
Oh yeah

[02:40:36.740 --> 02:40:37.820]
Oh yeah

[02:40:37.820 --> 02:40:38.140]
Oh yeah

[02:40:40.440 --> 02:40:42.180]
He's not checking to line up

[02:40:42.180 --> 02:40:43.820]
There is too much a fellow watcher

[02:40:44.440 --> 02:40:46.300]
He's still forgetting to take up hell

[02:40:46.300 --> 02:40:47.880]
He's got it in his head

[02:40:47.880 --> 02:40:49.860]
Taking pills and not a joke

[02:40:49.860 --> 02:40:51.220]
And for a cold and cold

[02:40:51.820 --> 02:40:53.180]
First and shortly, do it

[02:40:53.180 --> 02:40:54.800]
So come now I wanna smoke

[02:40:54.800 --> 02:40:56.840]
The Pope stops down

[02:40:56.840 --> 02:40:58.460]
Gains on the ground

[02:40:58.460 --> 02:41:00.500]
The Pope stops down

[02:41:00.500 --> 02:41:01.940]
He exits the command

[02:41:01.940 --> 02:41:04.280]
The Pope stops down

[02:41:04.280 --> 02:41:05.740]
He's a creepy head

[02:41:06.280 --> 02:41:07.740]
The Pope stops down

[02:41:07.740 --> 02:41:10.440]
The Pope stops down

[02:41:10.440 --> 02:41:11.580]
Oh yeah

[02:41:12.280 --> 02:41:13.460]
Oh yeah

[02:41:14.280 --> 02:41:17.500]
Oh yes

[02:41:18.280 --> 02:41:20.120]
The Pope is getting higher

[02:41:20.120 --> 02:41:23.680]
Higher, higher

[02:41:23.680 --> 02:41:32.640]
Aye, aye, aye

[02:41:32.640 --> 02:41:36.280]
The pop-spots don't, can't even look at it

[02:41:36.280 --> 02:41:39.740]
The pop-spots don't, he likes his second ass

[02:41:39.740 --> 02:41:43.420]
The pop-spots don't, he's a groovy ad-man

[02:41:43.420 --> 02:41:47.260]
The pop-spots don't, the pop-spots don't

[02:41:47.260 --> 02:41:52.900]
The pop-spots don't, the pop-spots don't

[02:41:52.900 --> 02:41:52.900]

[02:41:54.060 --> 02:41:57.300]
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry

[02:41:57.300 --> 02:41:59.500]
Everything we need is fairly ugly

[02:41:59.500 --> 02:42:00.720]
No, I think not

[02:42:01.280 --> 02:42:02.680]
Here, there's hope

[02:42:03.520 --> 02:42:05.060]
He's like, 모든오

[02:42:06.500 --> 02:42:07.300]

[02:42:07.300 --> 02:42:07.620]
Here's hope

[02:42:07.620 --> 02:42:07.620]

[02:42:07.620 --> 02:42:09.320]
I've already said too much

[02:42:09.320 --> 02:42:09.440]
No no no no no no no no

[02:42:09.440 --> 02:42:10.640]
Yeah, I've already said.

[02:42:11.140 --> 02:42:12.240]
No, there's hope

[02:42:12.240 --> 02:42:13.420]
No, there's hope

[02:42:13.420 --> 02:42:15.760]
No, there's hope

[02:42:15.760 --> 02:42:21.980]

I'm gonna play the whole game.

[02:43:31.100 --> 02:43:31.800]

[02:43:31.940 --> 02:43:32.620]
I'm gonna play the whole game.

[02:43:32.940 --> 02:43:33.380]
I'm gonna play the whole game.

[02:43:33.940 --> 02:43:34.440]
I'm gonna play the whole game.

[02:43:34.740 --> 02:43:35.780]
Hey, how the way is that?

[02:43:36.660 --> 02:43:37.040]
That's too.

[02:43:37.500 --> 02:43:39.600]
Anyway, 151 almost time to get out of here.

[02:43:39.680 --> 02:43:41.660]
Have a great holiday and get a facts here.

[02:43:41.740 --> 02:43:43.060]
Can you believe we got a facts on holiday?

[02:43:43.240 --> 02:43:43.440]
I don't.

[02:43:43.720 --> 02:43:44.380]
You know what else we have?

[02:43:44.800 --> 02:43:45.220]
What's that?

[02:43:45.440 --> 02:43:46.000]
A thousand, too.

[02:43:46.900 --> 02:43:47.220]
Woo!

[02:43:47.980 --> 02:43:49.040]
Heavy duty, baby.

[02:43:49.100 --> 02:43:50.300]
We got a thousand, too, on a pole.

[02:43:51.180 --> 02:43:55.440]
The only sad part about that pole is we asked about your favorite dead celebrity,

[02:43:55.640 --> 02:43:58.540]
the saddest of death of 2007 among celebrities.

[02:43:59.060 --> 02:44:02.740]
And leading the pack by far, none of these 232.

[02:44:02.920 --> 02:44:04.920]
We've got 47,000 names on here.

[02:44:05.360 --> 02:44:08.260]
And 232 people couldn't find anybody that, you know,

[02:44:09.160 --> 02:44:10.380]
how Sean Taylor do, 45.

[02:44:10.800 --> 02:44:11.360]
He moved up there.

[02:44:11.860 --> 02:44:12.540]
He flew up there.

[02:44:13.100 --> 02:44:15.900]
He went flying up there, which is really amazing when he came right down to it.

[02:44:15.900 --> 02:44:17.140]
Anyway, here's the facts.

[02:44:17.280 --> 02:44:20.900]
It says yesterday you read a quote and I'll be damned if I can't remember it.

[02:44:22.220 --> 02:44:25.040]
It contained a message about when the last brick of the last church

[02:44:25.040 --> 02:44:26.580]
would you help me with a quote in the author.

[02:44:26.720 --> 02:44:28.320]
This is one of our regular facts in his WB.

[02:44:28.780 --> 02:44:29.600]
And George writes at the bottom,

[02:44:29.600 --> 02:44:30.940]
Josh will be doing the stories.

[02:44:30.940 --> 02:44:32.140]
Well, thank God for that.

[02:44:33.720 --> 02:44:35.860]
On great old, little punk.

[02:44:36.340 --> 02:44:37.040]
Anyway, now he's all right.

[02:44:37.980 --> 02:44:39.780]
Anyway, here's the quote from Amio Zola.

[02:44:40.060 --> 02:44:45.180]
And anyway, this is what the Dinos, Dinos Guleacas or whatever his name is.

[02:44:45.180 --> 02:44:46.740]
I don't know.

[02:44:47.520 --> 02:44:49.180]
Tom, Jung, Jung Kipper.

[02:44:49.320 --> 02:44:51.680]
This is March 23rd, 2004.

[02:44:51.840 --> 02:44:52.420]
He said this to me.

[02:44:52.760 --> 02:44:53.180]
The quote was,

[02:44:53.440 --> 02:44:58.240]
Civilization will thrive when the last stone from the last church falls on the last priest.

[02:44:59.700 --> 02:45:01.120]
And I'm putting that right back over there.

[02:45:01.160 --> 02:45:02.020]
No one lose that.

[02:45:03.340 --> 02:45:05.600]
Words of wisdom from Amio Zola, baby.

[02:45:10.220 --> 02:45:11.500]
Words to live by, amen.

[02:45:11.840 --> 02:45:14.680]
During the weekend, I'm going to go ahead and start tearing some of the churches down.

[02:45:14.680 --> 02:45:15.540]
Some brick by brick.

[02:45:15.940 --> 02:45:17.360]
What the biggest name?

[02:45:17.600 --> 02:45:19.760]
The best talent here is Neil Rogers.

[02:45:20.180 --> 02:45:22.180]
4.2560 QAM.

[02:45:22.360 --> 02:45:23.980]
The next force, leader.

[02:45:24.320 --> 02:45:24.840]
You're God.

[02:45:26.240 --> 02:45:29.140]
My religion's better than your religion.

[02:45:29.380 --> 02:45:32.180]
My religion's better than yours.

[02:45:32.480 --> 02:45:32.920]

[02:45:33.280 --> 02:45:36.760]
My beliefs are what's required to avoid a lack of fire.

[02:45:36.920 --> 02:45:39.040]
My religion's better than yours.

[02:45:39.520 --> 02:45:39.900]
You're fair.

[02:45:40.280 --> 02:45:42.680]

[02:45:42.830 --> 02:45:46.130]

[02:45:46.430 --> 02:45:46.790]

[02:45:47.330 --> 02:45:50.710]
Why my religion annotates baby tree and racial hate?

[02:45:50.990 --> 02:45:52.990]
My religion's better than yours.

[02:45:54.270 --> 02:45:55.490]
