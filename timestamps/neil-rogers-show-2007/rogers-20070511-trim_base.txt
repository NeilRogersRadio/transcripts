steamed reading a quote that said why in moments of crisis do we ask God for

[00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.720]
strength and help as cognitive beings why would we ask something that may well

[00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.480]
be a figment of our imagination for guidance one of search inside ourselves for

[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.680]
the power to overcome after all we're strong enough to cause most of the

[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.820]

a harp on it I guess how's harpo doing it should be somewhere you can't wait

[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:51.300]
to go like a luxury hotel maybe blue skies and soft music were enough to keep

[00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.960]
people in line in the 17th century but heaven has to step it up a bit they're

[00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:00.700]
better like that yeah they're basically getting by because they only have to

[00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.200]
be better than hell Joel Stein comments for the early times wrote that in

[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.980]
some other coffee cups there's absolutely no reason to put that on a cup pack

[00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:14.940]
told WND what is WND is that this site I don't know what WND is do you know

[00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:19.420]
what it is I'm afraid I don't I don't know it he told somebody from a

[00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.960]
market standpoint it blows me away he says I don't put a picture Christ on my

[00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.180]
business card pecs says the issues cut energized him to push for a boycott a

[00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.440]
starbucks in favor of the local coffee houses in Polk County Florida maybe

[00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:35.100]
Polk Salad and he'll be in there and poke somebody poke this man yeah everyone

[00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.560]
I've shown the cup to has been flabbergasted whether they have a face faith in

[00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.080]
Christ or not he said Seattle based Starbucks meanwhile is making no apologies

[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.300]
about the guy related messages no it's campaign we're committed to the

[00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.640]
program Starbucks communications manager Trisha Moriardi told WND noting that

[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.820]
quotes about matters of faith make up only a small fraction of the printed

[00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:58.920]
quips we covered topics such as theater film the environment

[00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:10.360]
food and sports the cops are not pro or anti-religion per se when I

[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.480]
asked if there was any scenario I sure like that let's play that until two o'clock

[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:18.640]
I love it I guarantee the powers that we would like that a lot better than

[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:22.000]
what I'm gonna say today after I give that very jackass calm now these people

[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.160]
are just in total denial but nevertheless they are as cool as is the day is

[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.520]
long and I don't want to get started now because once I get started I'll

[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.460]
miss the break and miss everything I can get a little whipped I can get myself a

[00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.260]
little whipped up about them and about what they're doing to this place but then

[00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.580]
again very jackass you know they're younger over there across the street and

[00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:43.180]
they're hip-roar and they're younger it's the same crap like I told you the other

[00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:47.180]
day when they had that one funny month a couple years ago with 18 to 34 men

[00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.860]
and they had a few wired diaries oh this is gonna be our demographic this is where

[00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:53.620]
we're gonna really excel and then of course the following month they all

[00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:57.240]
disappeared because there was a bunch of wired diaries it was phony see I know a

[00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:00.720]
little bit something about ratings in the way they work believe me trust me I've

[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:04.060]
been doing this for about 600 years very jackass and they'll have those only

[00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:07.740]
one thing and that is the suck heavy duty ass of the people across the street

[00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:10.740]
because they have incestuous relationship in addition to which he doesn't even

[00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:14.000]
realize he's too stupid to realize just like most of the people in this building are

[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.140]
too stupid to realize we don't compete with them on this show up we don't give

[00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:20.280]
a crap about them we're gonna compete with that loud mouth in the York piece of

[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:24.360]
turd that we don't do a sports show our competition is rush speaking a loud

[00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:28.420]
mouth pieces of turd and uh... scare America that's it we do a talk show here

[00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:33.420]
not a stupid ass sports show anyway when asked if there was any scenario that

[00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:36.120]
would prompt the company to move a certain comforts campaign she says she

[00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:39.940]
couldn't come out on a hypothetical situation saying certainly we have no plans

[00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:43.900]
to remove any of them I say you go star box good for you I'm going this weekend

[00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:47.460]
and she provided the wnd with a couple messages that can be viewed as pro

[00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:51.400]
god and there was always a good and god dang it stuff like that

[00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:55.160]
all i'm gonna i'm gonna tell you something and once i get going today you're

[00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.340]
gonna have to like uh... semi-sum doggy dollars

[00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:03.020]
because it's just amazing to me this stupidity just it's in the year everywhere

[00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:04.440]
with this outfit

[00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:08.360]

crap yeah they suck

[00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.660]
and and and and the many most of the stuff we put on the air starts to you know

[00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:24.060]
me a lot of people who don't belong on here but that's the nature of the

[00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:27.120]
market it's a bush league town with a lot of bush league management and bush

[00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:30.860]
league uh... operators who think that there were there are broadcasters

[00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:32.300]
that broadcast is

[00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:36.300]
like when you mark that is a broadcast is and put squeaky voice people on the

[00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:38.900]
air to see how how much can the audience endure

[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:42.500]
and of course there's us who like we we operate in a vacuum

[00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:45.520]
the like living your life in the city can you

[00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:48.960]
you're going to have too much uh...

[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:52.600]
that that that that that that's what the outer world when you live in the

[00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:54.240]
like looking at life of the dumpster

[00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:55.500]
okay

[00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:59.780]

[00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:00.900]
that chopper machine

bestest with the testies

[00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:06.500]
anyway we're gonna make a thousand votes easy on a poll later christian just

[00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:09.400]
relax and stuff your face with fattening food i'm not going to tell you i

[00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:13.020]

[00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:16.200]
it i may not well i have a deal you just a day so it's not so you had jelly

[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.480]
belly no just the regular kind

[00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:22.380]
yeah i got i got fat belly is what i got all the way at a good time it would buy

[00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:25.440]
mine and boy when you go in there and get that spin for twenty and you know

[00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:28.880]
it if you ever played real fortune all that's right you ask me no i don't know

[00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:32.380]
i play this i did this when you get a spin you know which of course a lot of

[00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:34.900]
people think that's where it's at and sometimes it's the fight on the

[00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:36.080]
machine that's definitely where it's at

[00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:38.120]
to a greater step

[00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:41.860]
but anyway when you get a spin like on the dollar machine there's four hundred

[00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:43.660]
five hundred and a thousand those are the three

[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:47.280]
spins that if they're coming up when the win since all program the head of

[00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:50.220]
time when the spin comes up and the computer already knows what it's going to

[00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:53.660]
pay you the rest is just a dog and pony show to get you all excited oh come on

[00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:55.000]
thousand thousand come on

[00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:59.040]
but anyway when it gets to four hundred five hundred thousand when we'll get

[00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:01.660]
about three or four spaces away from the the number

[00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:03.920]
the audio is programmed to go

[00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:05.580]
uh... you can they start

[00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:09.800]
yet and so you know what's going to start on my final machine i hit the

anyway so very jackass being on about to get this uh... cranked up here hey

[00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:24.380]
very

[00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:29.180]
after less than three years on the air very right in fact the headline is the

[00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:31.020]
ticket passes wq a m

[00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:31.520]

they got a book they got a month actually is what they got we beat him in

[00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:36.780]
february we beat him in march and of course work

[00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:40.260]
let me just before i go into buries calm i want to backtrack a little bit and

[00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:41.260]
give a little recent history

[00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:44.580]
maybe not that recent but in the last year or two

[00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:47.700]
now christ i don't know if christ was listening when this was going on but

[00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:52.320]
dan el bastard in his blog at the herald he started a little contest between

[00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:55.240]
the two stations which which you know it was a very contrived and of course

[00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:58.580]
they were controlling it he was on the inside he works over there so you know

[00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:02.580]
us they had the inside deal on it and they would be executives over there all

[00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:05.220]
sitting in the memo's out of which we got copies and read on the air all

[00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:08.540]
we're running this contest with q a m be sure in you and everybody you know

[00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:11.780]
and everybody in the phone book votes uh... thousand times for the ticket

[00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:15.340]
and it was the uh... what station you like better and you like uh... manage

[00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:19.020]
better or uh... this one or that one at the booster uh... the bastard or

[00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:21.180]
hanker and and and so they

[00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:24.700]
see this award it's called compete compete

[00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:27.480]
c-o-n-p-e-t-e-e-p whoo what it means

[00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:31.940]
see i'm a believer in having if you have good competition it makes you

[00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:34.920]
better i'm never been scared of competition whether was rush whether was

[00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:38.640]
secure america but and they put everybody uh... near uh... throw everything

[00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:41.600]
but the kitchen sink in the over the years and all the different stations and

[00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:44.360]
if you're going to be scared of competition you know belong in the business

[00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:48.920]
and so was the q-m reaction to the banister's blog thing with the contest

[00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:52.860]
between or just ignore it just ignore it and so i was going to sit back and watch

[00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:55.580]
them pulverize us while they're promoting hell out of it over there

[00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:59.920]
and so thanks to our friend Eric up in Orlando and thanks to our audience out

[00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:03.520]
there we uh... clobberton pretty good we we meet him we made a comeback actually

[00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:06.940]
they had a head start because they were all promoting it and we did it without any

[00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:09.960]
assistance from anybody else on the air on the station because clearance

[00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:13.700]
who is he's the evil doer i'm telling you right now he is the evil doer

[00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:17.180]
i mean judges the evil doer nipples but i'm talking about inside the building

[00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:20.520]
he's the one needs to be taken out and put right with that car in about of that

[00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:23.360]
pool and held down there a long time several hours

[00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:27.260]
although i don't respond to them all i'm sure he didn't make that decision because

[00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:30.220]
he couldn't decide which hand a wife is asked with i'm sure that management

[00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:33.860]
decided all will do we don't want to respond to them we don't want to bring

[00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:35.380]
attention to them but you know

[00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:40.740]
i would have a nice if they'd had about eighty-zillion votes and our people

[00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:41.280]
had nothing

[00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:43.280]
would you know

[00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:48.160]
compete that's what i'm saying compete don't just sit back and assume see

[00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:51.060]
this is a problem in this radio station they think they can assume their way

[00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:52.360]
through the rest of their existence

[00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:56.680]
all with a sport station as if of course is if that format is viable anymore

[00:17:56.680 --> 00:18:00.220]
which it's not but assuming that it was where the sport station we've been

[00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:02.520]
not sport station for seven genius whatever you know

[00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:06.200]
they don't promote they don't compete they don't do anything they're just

[00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:08.380]
they're they're like in a vegetative state

[00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:11.640]
Florida a vegetative state which sounds like

[00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:14.080]
millions of people need a lot of season to hear that

[00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:15.840]
like that and also like

[00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:17.080]
it's a good idea

[00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:21.720]
anyway here's what very jackass right i just bring that up because it's a classic

[00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:25.380]
example of the way the passive way that this outfit just kind of like sits

[00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:28.420]
back and also they went out and got the dolphins well you know something if you

[00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:31.220]
want to spend a lot of the money you can go out and get anything what what is

[00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:32.100]
that going to do for it

[00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:35.380]
and the guy with a voice that sounds like john facenda who does all these

[00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:38.700]
stintorian the whole model you know all all these things like

[00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:42.160]
the biggest name that coming's got a great voice and those are very impressive a

[00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:44.000]
few times but not again to be annoying you know

[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.360]
and let me say this here other than the people who already listen to the radio

[00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:50.760]
station who else knows that we got the dolphins now

[00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:55.280]
you see what i'm saying our votes and instruments going out to people tap

this business of looking at porn on the internet what could possibly be wrong with that okay anyway

[00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:21.960]
let's get back to a very the fairy here on the Harold Vither and Sestuous relationship making the

[00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:26.700]
same old higher stories they're younger they're hip-hop it's really interesting very we must have

[00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:31.020]
gotten awfully old and they must have gotten off the young between December and January now that's

[00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:35.500]
the interesting part of that whole philosophy so stupid you have to be a moron very but of course

[00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:39.160]
that's the propaganda they've been feeding for a long time and so he do the flea writes it in

[00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:42.320]
there because whatever they tell very fact they might even write the article and very just puts his

[00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:48.240]
name on it hey very you fairy the brown bag kid from the Harold in morning drive the tickets to

[00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:51.520]
a rose finish tent in the market with a three point to I'm not going to read the Q numbers because

[00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:56.700]
they're it's just it's ridiculous and nobody reports the Q numbers but that's okay because

[00:28:56.700 --> 00:29:00.540]
cum distance the total number of people you reach in a week the average quarter hours what

[00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:03.980]
anybody cares about because that's how many people you're reaching at any given moment not how

[00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:08.920]
many people may listen for five minutes a week who cares about that the cum my eyes very anyway

[00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:13.540]
Joe Rose finished 10th with a three two QM's Kenny Walker and Kim Bokehamper were 21st with a

[00:29:13.540 --> 00:29:19.480]
1.8 a 1.3 can eight oh my god and then he writes no wonder wqm wants to hire Rose for its morning

[00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:24.400]
show rose who 790 contract runs through September 1nd of the Kennedy has made a decision he better

[00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:28.800]
come back over here and what did I say when they blew his ass out the door when Greg read lied to

[00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:33.920]
him and lied installed around it wouldn't you know yeah I just put him over more times on both

[00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:39.440]
stations and you can then Carter's got liver pills and the meantime he's gets the numbers and I

[00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:42.860]
said on the year then and I'll say it again now that's when they really that was when they broke

[00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:47.000]
this thing into a million pieces and what did they do that for so they could put the Howard

[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:52.420]
stirring show on the year and Dan near lose the license and sliced that thing up with Swiss cheese

[00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:57.580]
and bleeping and bleeping and buzzing and buzzing and bleeping and yeah and playing music over the

[00:29:57.580 --> 00:30:02.940]
fart sounds just just craziness active lunatics and by the way Joyce had her finger deep inside of

[00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:09.080]
that back home so yeah she was there when they did that I mean it wasn't bad enough for

[00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:14.860]
real almost lost him license so let's put on the stern show yeah an afternoon drive between 4 and

[00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:20.220]
7 Jim Madditch and Hank Goldberg had a slightly higher share than the ticket stand of bastard and

[00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:24.200]
John Wiener Stugas see here's the thing they're talking about Stugas like he belongs on the

[00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:29.580]
year just like just like we talk about him like he belongs on the year see that's not competing that's

[00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:33.140]
just capitulating that's just putting clearance his boyfriends on the year and who aren't even going

[00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:38.720]
to be here but the ticket had more listeners and there goes with the cum again so the power

[00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:44.540]
hour had the 3 7 they had a 3 5 that's the power hour between 4 and 5 that's my my brain trust

[00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:50.740]
oh and then here's a classic line to show that Barry doesn't even understand the ratings here's

[00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:55.180]
how that can happen in measuring shares arbitrage heavily factors in like the time people listen

[00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:59.040]
the cumulative audience numbers don't take that into account it's not gonna do with the heavily

[00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:03.680]
factor it in it's got to do with that's the factor okay match factor rich factor that's what

[00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:09.060]
it's all about schmuck he don't even understand how they do it also telling once managed left the

[00:31:09.060 --> 00:31:16.100]
year at five goldberg's numbers dropped oh boy from five to seven that was on what he's

[00:31:16.100 --> 00:31:21.700]
laughing about then sound fine to me it sounds like from five to seven the backstreet and we know

[00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:26.660]
we're fifth at one why does it keep saying and weener is he I mean oh god fifth in the market

[00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:32.500]
with a 4.5 share compared with goalbers 2.9 which ranked 14th which is all I can say about

[00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:39.500]
that when you come right down to it 14th must have been what's his name that the scout he's

[00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:47.360]
always got on the scout the be your scout oh from two to four John Chambie and the Sid Rosenberg

[00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:51.520]
steam crants through a higher share than managed two seven to a two three even though Neal Rogers

[00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:55.940]
had a higher share than the tickets combo of Chambie and Rosenberg 10 aimed to 2.5 4.1 to a

[00:31:55.940 --> 00:31:59.980]
two two two two it sounds like almost double to me the tickets surprisingly had more listeners

[00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:05.440]
than he goes into the cum again yada yada which doesn't mean anything they got a two two period

[00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:09.840]
you know you can try to you can try to dolly it all off and put a bow on it and dress it all up

[00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:14.860]
and well two two is a two two that's the rating that's what people buy that's what the bonus is

[00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:19.720]
based on that's the number the average quarter hour that's correct not the cum QA

[00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:23.620]
attracted a higher cum audience in the ticket only one time slot five to seven A and one or

[00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:28.000]
lander the big O who's rock solid had a higher share than me for which who's hated by all four

[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:32.040]
row to a two five and more listeners to and they go into the cum crap again oh let me do the

[00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:36.960]
break and then out then comes the best part don't overstate the impact of the ticket losing the

[00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:43.200]
dolphins versus as he continues sucking and sucking oh my god it's unbelievable a very enough of

[00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:50.900]

you either like the skin and kiss your lips or you like catten

[00:33:22.780 --> 00:33:33.340]
you either like boxing or who does win or you like Broadway

[00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:46.820]
you

[00:33:46.820 --> 00:34:07.460]
You either whip pastel and have a bell on your bicycle or you like pizza pie and

[00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:13.380]
come on ride without the pig on.

[00:34:13.700 --> 00:34:25.900]
You either work on cars and fighting bars or when you want to sashay.

[00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:37.240]
Because either you are straight or my friend you are gay.

[00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:43.900]
Come find us see how the number dreary be.

[00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:49.900]
But leave that chill with life the by way.

[00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:54.020]
Because we long to pass.

[00:34:54.640 --> 00:35:04.660]
In every pass like the football shot and the rest of the game.

[00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:15.900]
On your game you can only go one way.

[00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:18.140]
You fare it.

[00:35:20.380 --> 00:35:22.940]
Ethan Skolnik is going to be the answer for our problems.

[00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:24.420]
We have Ethan coming up.

[00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:27.880]
Another horse ball, a hack writer for one of the newspapers.

[00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:32.960]
Alex Marfayz and Eric Reid and all of these people.

[00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:35.820]
I am screaming and yelling and carrying on old Jamie Duffy.

[00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:37.700]
I guess they finally smit canned him.

[00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:42.060]
I don't know.

[00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:43.720]
This is their idea.

[00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:45.640]
Not entertaining people.

[00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:51.040]
That's why people listen to radio shows.

[00:35:51.220 --> 00:35:53.060]
That's why people watch TV shows.

[00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:56.780]
They want to be entertained.

[00:35:57.220 --> 00:35:58.020]
They want to be informed.

[00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:03.840]
They want something that stimulates their mind, brain, that too.

[00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:05.240]
What word did you say?

[00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:06.260]
You heard it.

[00:36:06.380 --> 00:36:09.320]
You are going to get him involved in this too.

[00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:10.460]
I have something to say to him.

[00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:14.420]
I pay back everybody to swindle all that money for a pool.

[00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:17.100]
Anyway.

[00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:19.220]
That's what people want.

[00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:20.940]
I know there comes a great shock especially here.

[00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:23.020]
All they want to hear is the ball scores.

[00:36:23.380 --> 00:36:25.100]
They want to hear who are the most macho guys.

[00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:29.040]
That sounds real macho to me.

[00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:30.300]
Idiots.

[00:36:31.180 --> 00:36:33.420]
We are surrounded by a sea of idiots and we are drowning.

[00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:35.680]
Even the best women are not titanic.

[00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:37.180]
They drown.

[00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:37.860]
They are dead.

[00:36:39.940 --> 00:36:40.960]
868 votes on the pool.

[00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:42.440]
What's the source for most of your porn?

[00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:46.280]
I don't really know for sure what that means.

[00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:51.640]
A lot of people don't think that porn means what it means.

[00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:53.640]
Look at the jc pedicatalog.

[00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:54.660]
That could be porn.

[00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:57.880]
It's whatever cranks your shot.

[00:36:57.880 --> 00:37:00.200]
Listening to a gelbie on the air that could be pornographic.

[00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:05.760]
The internet 564.5% of the people out there getting their porn from the internet's baby.

[00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:07.400]
There's lots of it on there.

[00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:08.800]
Over here, over there.

[00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:09.660]
Oh, take a look at that.

[00:37:09.780 --> 00:37:10.000]
Wow.

[00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:12.520]
DVDs 91.

[00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:17.200]
I don't watch porn 74.8.5% of this audience tell us they don't watch porn.

[00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:17.760]
Period.

[00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:18.820]
Yeah.

[00:37:19.260 --> 00:37:20.420]
My imagination 49.

[00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:22.820]
It was just, I can't stop thinking about that.

[00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:23.400]
Don't play it again.

[00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:23.820]
I won't.

[00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:25.240]
Video's 33.

[00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:29.120]
Peeping at other people's windows still about 30 men.

[00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:31.760]
I don't know why I find that so funny, but about 30.

[00:37:31.900 --> 00:37:33.560]
Well, we got a lot of desperate folks out there.

[00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:37.620]
So if you look out the window late at night and you and your partner are involved in clenching

[00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:39.540]
and clenching and the humping and pumping away.

[00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:41.900]
And you look out the window and there's a pair of eyes looking in.

[00:37:42.100 --> 00:37:43.720]
It won't be the neighborhood pasta, Maracco.

[00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:44.560]
And it'll just be the neighbor.

[00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:46.780]
They're just to get in their jolly.

[00:37:46.940 --> 00:37:48.100]
So let them have a good look.

[00:37:48.940 --> 00:37:50.580]
C pedilog's like Victoria's Secret 14.

[00:37:50.580 --> 00:37:53.200]
X-rated magazines like Playboy and Hustler 11.

[00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:54.280]
Well, what does that mean?

[00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:55.100]
X-rated magazines.

[00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:57.380]
Do magazines have ratings since when?

[00:37:57.600 --> 00:37:58.000]
Whatever.

[00:37:58.840 --> 00:37:59.940]
Well, I didn't make this point.

[00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:00.180]
I did.

[00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:01.480]
Another one of Charlie B's.

[00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:02.360]
Yeah, Charlie B.

[00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:04.360]
Charlie, you'll be having some problems.

[00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:05.620]
Comic books 4.

[00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:06.560]
Well, what does that mean?

[00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:07.900]
Comic books have pornography?

[00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:09.260]
There are, I guess.

[00:38:12.100 --> 00:38:15.200]
I mean, that's really like stick figures.

[00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:17.800]
You know, I guess all depending on what they're sticking or they're sticking.

[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:19.200]
Hey, different comic books 4.

[00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:24.320]
And softcore magazines like FHM, FHM, N-Aximet's Edward II, out of 878.

[00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:26.200]
We got 1,000 made in a shade.

[00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:27.100]
Don't worry about it, Chris.

[00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:31.020]
Just sit back there with a big smug look on your face and enjoy a real rant today.

[00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:33.140]
You've got a four-hour rant coming up from The Old Queen.

[00:38:33.820 --> 00:38:34.380]
Can you handle it?

[00:38:35.300 --> 00:38:35.540]
Yeah.

[00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:36.660]
Hey, take that hotline call.

[00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:39.200]
Oh, I bet you that forgot all about that.

[00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:40.500]
I bet you that's my good buddy, Ricky.

[00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:41.980]
Hey, Neil, how are you?

[00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:43.140]
It's Jimmy Hummel.

[00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:43.600]
How you doing?

[00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:45.400]
Jimmy Hummel, just fine.

[00:38:45.540 --> 00:38:45.880]
Thank you.

[00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:47.020]
Was this it today?

[00:38:47.020 --> 00:38:47.500]
That was it?

[00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:49.000]
It's time.

[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:49.340]
Come on.

[00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:51.120]
Come on, one more show, man.

[00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:53.000]
No, no, no, it's time.

[00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:53.540]
It's done.

[00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:54.860]
One more week.

[00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:55.540]
I'm sorry?

[00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:56.800]
One more week.

[00:38:56.940 --> 00:38:58.240]
No, no, no.

[00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:04.080]
I've been dealing with this mentally for quite a while and the lead up to today has been

[00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:06.520]
very emotional as you might imagine.

[00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:09.780]
You know, 50 years is a lot of water under the bridge and it's over.

[00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:11.340]
That's 50 years in a business.

[00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:12.200]
Yeah, yeah.

[00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:18.320]
I started, my first job in radio was in 1960, so that would be a 47.

[00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:20.240]
So I'm not that far behind you.

[00:39:20.260 --> 00:39:21.220]
No, you're right close.

[00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:22.360]
That's when I came to the lie.

[00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:23.620]
I am not a Nazi.

[00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:26.320]
Remember those days?

[00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:27.000]
Oh, indeed.

[00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:27.960]
Yeah.

[00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:29.520]
Yeah, you got a good memory for an old fart.

[00:39:29.660 --> 00:39:30.000]
I'll say that.

[00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:31.380]
Let's play this in honor of...

[00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:32.440]
Rick...

[00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:33.460]
Sean...

[00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:35.240]
Who harked the microphone this morning on Magic.

[00:39:35.420 --> 00:39:38.080]
You are, I'm telling you, you're inspiration to all this other old fart.

[00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:38.640]
So I'll say that.

[00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:40.300]
Well, thank you very much, Neil.

[00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:41.620]
I appreciate that.

[00:39:41.620 --> 00:39:45.840]
It's been a fun run and I'm going to stay with the children's fun, keep doing that.

[00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:49.780]
And you know, there's some other stuff around the station doing commercials and what have you.

[00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:51.500]
But just not getting up at four o'clock.

[00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:52.460]
That's killing me.

[00:39:52.620 --> 00:39:53.960]
Oh, I don't know how to how you did that.

[00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:54.740]
I wouldn't do that.

[00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:59.740]
They offered me just a ton of money to do mornings on this station about a year ago or a year ago.

[00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:00.920]
I said, oh, forget about it.

[00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:01.800]
You could offer me 10 minutes.

[00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:02.520]
I still wouldn't do it.

[00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:05.420]
Well, you make more money doing mid days and most people make doing the morning show.

[00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:06.780]
Well, what can I tell you?

[00:40:06.820 --> 00:40:07.620]
No comment about that.

[00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:09.760]
That's the only reason I'm here.

[00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:11.060]
So how did it go this morning?

[00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:13.180]
Did you break down in the cry like a baby?

[00:40:13.340 --> 00:40:13.760]
How did it go?

[00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:15.360]
Well, there were some tears.

[00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:18.600]
But I really did a whole lot better than I thought I was going to.

[00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:25.840]
We had a lot of very emotional phone calls and the kids called up and sang songs and all of that.

[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:31.700]
And we had a bunch of old things that I had produced along the way that we dug up and re-aired.

[00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:32.720]
And a lot of memories.

[00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:37.480]
It was really a very fun morning but a very emotionally draining one, as you might suspect.

[00:40:37.820 --> 00:40:38.220]
I'm looking forward to it.

[00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:40.480]
I'm looking forward to my last show.

[00:40:40.580 --> 00:40:42.040]
Boy, it's going to be a barn boon out there.

[00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:46.640]
I will be there for your last show deal.

[00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:47.680]
I will be there for your last show deal.

[00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:47.680]

[00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:49.320]
It's coming soon, by the way.

[00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:50.420]
Not that soon, by the way.

[00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:51.280]
Come on, Arty.

[00:40:51.460 --> 00:40:52.140]
You're going to re-sign.

[00:40:52.300 --> 00:40:53.320]
Are you going to put an extension on it?

[00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:56.000]
Yeah, I'm going to put an extension in here.

[00:40:56.220 --> 00:40:56.280]
I'm going to put an extension in here.

[00:40:56.460 --> 00:40:57.320]
I'm going to call it cone.

[00:40:57.400 --> 00:40:58.400]
I'm going to become a conehead.

[00:40:58.980 --> 00:41:03.060]
So what are you going to do now that you've naturally sleep in and stuff like that?

[00:41:03.140 --> 00:41:04.560]
Yeah, well, that's the main thing.

[00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:08.200]
It was just really getting to me that early, 4am wake up cone.

[00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:09.740]
I was always just getting to be a real drag.

[00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:14.000]
We like the crew, so my wife and I are going to take a crew seven days someplace.

[00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:16.920]
Not sure when or where, but that's one of the priorities.

[00:41:17.420 --> 00:41:19.300]
And like I said, I'm going to crank up the children's fund.

[00:41:19.580 --> 00:41:23.600]
I kind of make that my passion, you know, helping needy kids in South Florida

[00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:25.480]
through the charity at the radio station.

[00:41:26.020 --> 00:41:28.320]
And it's been a very rewarding experience.

[00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:29.820]
So I like to do that.

[00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:32.500]
It helps a lot of kids, and that's where I'm going to spend most of my time.

[00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:34.540]
I always hear from people,

[00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:37.160]
all of you are going to shrivel up and die real soon.

[00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:37.680]
Yeah, I know.

[00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:38.580]
You want to be anything to do.

[00:41:38.740 --> 00:41:40.720]
Just keep busy, I guess, is the message.

[00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:41.220]
Well, that's it.

[00:41:41.380 --> 00:41:42.820]
You need a reason to get up in the morning.

[00:41:42.980 --> 00:41:44.620]
You got to have that car's out there.

[00:41:44.700 --> 00:41:45.180]
Something to do.

[00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:46.020]
You're absolutely right.

[00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:48.000]
A lot of people have told me the same thing.

[00:41:48.180 --> 00:41:49.320]
So I'm sensitive to that.

[00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:50.200]
I'm going to stay busy.

[00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:53.320]
And, you know, not going to just try up and be approved.

[00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:56.280]
You know, I try to send you a message that's not in your Myspace.

[00:41:56.440 --> 00:41:57.480]
Net damn thing is screwed up.

[00:41:57.560 --> 00:41:59.780]
I click the send the message and it doesn't work.

[00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:00.420]
Oh, really?

[00:42:00.860 --> 00:42:01.060]
Yeah.

[00:42:01.420 --> 00:42:02.160]
Where's the radio station?

[00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:04.120]
I'm your Myspace page.

[00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:04.780]
Oh, Myspace.

[00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:06.420]
You're one of my buddies on here, man.

[00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:07.580]
You're one of my 80 million buddies.

[00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:08.140]
Oh, yeah.

[00:42:08.260 --> 00:42:08.640]
I know.

[00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:09.520]
I signed up for you.

[00:42:09.940 --> 00:42:12.180]
I thought you were going to try to send you a message, but it wouldn't go through.

[00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:13.340]
So don't think I'm ignoring you.

[00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:13.740]
Okay.

[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:14.500]
That's cool.

[00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:15.580]
I talked to George this morning.

[00:42:15.580 --> 00:42:15.960]
He called.

[00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:24.480]
And I told him, and I'll tell you, too, I believe the George doing part time like he does is better than most people doing full time in talk.

[00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:26.320]
He doesn't get the credit he deserves.

[00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:27.060]
He doesn't get the credit he deserves.

[00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:32.580]
Of course, inside the building, it doesn't get any credit because they hate him like Poisonin because Jolly Joell Bell wants to put tape song when I'm not.

[00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:36.020]
It's just pathetic the way they treat people, but then again, you know the business.

[00:42:36.660 --> 00:42:38.280]
What it is, deal with it and move on.

[00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:44.360]
In other words, what you're trying to say is the business really blows.

[00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:47.740]
I mean, it's been good to me.

[00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:48.820]
I can't complain.

[00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:53.120]
But it's, well, I don't want to, you know, and I don't want to go out on a sour note after 50 years.

[00:42:53.260 --> 00:42:55.600]
Keep a big smile on your face and all that other stuff, right?

[00:42:55.820 --> 00:42:56.460]
You got it, Neil.

[00:42:56.880 --> 00:42:57.860]
Pretend they treated you great.

[00:42:58.100 --> 00:42:59.040]
Yes, sir, absolutely.

[00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:00.980]
Well, listen, congratulations, my friend.

[00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:03.640]
You really deserve all the good stuff and come your way.

[00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:04.500]
Well, thank you so much.

[00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:09.780]
We're having a big to do with Gulf Stream tonight and looking forward to that and going on a cruise and having some fun.

[00:43:09.860 --> 00:43:11.140]
And I'll stay in touch with you, Neil.

[00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:12.240]
You are, you're my god.

[00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:12.860]
You're my idol.

[00:43:13.260 --> 00:43:14.020]
Please do it and listen.

[00:43:14.180 --> 00:43:16.240]
Wash off that cap before you hand over to that other guy.

[00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:18.220]
Yeah, I'm going to pass it over tonight.

[00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:19.820]
Keep in touch, Rick.

[00:43:19.820 --> 00:43:20.520]
Best of luck to you.

[00:43:20.540 --> 00:43:21.000]
Thank you, Neil.

[00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:21.560]
Thank you very much.

[00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:21.960]
Bye, Rick.

[00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:25.020]
Rick Shaw, who actually peed all over Georgia's legacy.

[00:43:25.140 --> 00:43:28.480]
I still touched by that because, you know, he's a good guy in English.

[00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:29.120]
He's a really good guy.

[00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:30.660]
He's a good people in the world for him.

[00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:32.400]
Well, there's some nasty people in business.

[00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:33.580]
Don't talk about him.

[00:43:33.620 --> 00:43:34.600]
He's a rock and roll from him.

[00:43:35.540 --> 00:43:36.140]
Well, there you go.

[00:43:36.660 --> 00:43:37.400]
He's going to be missed.

[00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:38.080]
That's for damn sure.

[00:43:38.180 --> 00:43:39.820]
Ricky Tickin, that new guy who comes in, boy.

[00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:41.420]
Wow, how'd you like to be that big shoes?

[00:43:41.580 --> 00:43:42.000]
No, thank you.

[00:43:42.300 --> 00:43:43.080]
I know what that feels like.

[00:43:43.100 --> 00:43:44.120]
Big shoes to feel, minds, right?

[00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:46.160]
1056 at 560 WQM.

[00:43:46.340 --> 00:43:47.800]
This is the Neil Roger Show.

[00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:50.620]
This is the brain.

[00:44:15.400 --> 00:44:20.580]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

[00:44:20.580 --> 00:44:27.780]
The low daily interest rate of 37% said some will be collected by station representative Joe the night, Kuzmina winner is obligated to pay and or pony up or risk

[00:44:27.780 --> 00:44:34.360]
Camping both their knees broken with the baseball bat continued on payment will result in winner sleeping with the fish employees of this radio station and their families are not

[00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:38.620]
Eligible to have their debts paid their knees broken or sleep with the fishes unless they do sell on their own time

[00:44:38.620 --> 00:44:40.360]
Cash your self out

[00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:47.300]
He's listening to me. It's 11.02 at 5.60 WQ. I'm happy Friday. So we had Jimmy Hummel Rickshaw on here there for a few minutes and

[00:44:47.780 --> 00:44:54.440]
He's hung it up this morning. It was at 50 years on the air and a zillion years in this market and so somebody sends me this facts from

[00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:58.720]
Oh look at this. It was an article of hero rocking rocking South Florida radio

[00:45:01.020 --> 00:45:04.980]
It says did you know the rich shall work to WQM away back? Yes, we do and yes

[00:45:04.980 --> 00:45:06.560]
We did in Tiger in

[00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:11.480]
2000 money wrote the following article in South Florida history the official publication of the historical museum of Southern

[00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:13.280]
Florida about South Florida Meridian market in the early days

[00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:16.760]
Does anybody remember those days? Well he does because he's old just like me

[00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:22.500]
And anyway, this is this would be pretty interesting it goes back to when radio really meant something and when people

[00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:26.960]
You know when there were people in it and running it who knew something about radio something about broadcasting

[00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:29.000]
Which unfortunately there ain't much of that around anymore

[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:31.640]
He's not gonna say that because why would you say that on your way out?

[00:45:31.780 --> 00:45:37.440]
You know he's gonna grow a big smile on his face. Don't let the rain be your what's that crap that joy used to say all the time?

[00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:43.080]
Let it smile be your brother smile be your umbrella and stick it up your butt. That's what joy used to say

[00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:46.260]
Anyways, we're getting back to very jackass column

[00:45:47.540 --> 00:45:53.140]
He says don't overstate the impact of the ticket losing the dolphins because the ratings book did not cover any of the dolphins season

[00:45:53.140 --> 00:45:58.000]
It's clear that the ticket will remain a formidable competitor to WQM even after losing Finns games

[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:03.400]
That's right. They had one month out of one book that goose them up there and that makes them a formidable competitor to anybody

[00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:06.980]
I'm gonna tell you who our worst competitor is okay ourselves

[00:46:07.740 --> 00:46:12.820]
That's our most competitor. We are the enemy. We've seen the enemy and the enemy is us

[00:46:13.080 --> 00:46:14.580]
I don't want to get like melodramatic

[00:46:16.580 --> 00:46:20.440]
But that I mean that's accurate. That's absolutely correct Neil. Thank you

[00:46:21.380 --> 00:46:27.880]
Then Barry goes on to say to evacuate I am gonna do maybe the whole four hours on this, you know, I mean your oldies don't

[00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:35.500]
Glober's contract expires at the end of the year in WQM general manager Joe Bell

[00:46:35.500 --> 00:46:40.580]
Joe Bell somebody needs to ring his bell okay and wake his ass up his fan ass up

[00:46:41.420 --> 00:46:44.640]
Had nothing to say about his long-term future meaning the Humper

[00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:53.700]
Beyond noting that he'll speak with Goldberg in his agent stay tuned Barry writes. Yes, stay tuned see if we can get enough oxygen

[00:46:54.460 --> 00:46:58.280]
Le Bastard's impressive growth on the rating suggests young listeners had drawn to the humor

[00:46:58.280 --> 00:47:02.200]
They clever off beat bits and some of the pop culture chat is become a staple of a show

[00:47:02.200 --> 00:47:06.220]
Oh, you mean not just because they talked to guys that were jock straps and people like all the time

[00:47:07.620 --> 00:47:14.440]
That's what that's what these people don't understand we are surrounded by and you've been screaming about it since even before I came in the door there

[00:47:14.980 --> 00:47:21.000]
People who all they know is ball games and scores and give me the ball and give me the ball on 9-11

[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:27.360]
They're flying built the planes into the World Trade Center and we got guilty on it. How are we gonna say about it? We got to talk about sports

[00:47:30.300 --> 00:47:34.480]
Le Bastard's growth one front inside WQM is that the station needs to develop more young host

[00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:37.020]
Oh one thought inside Q a m

[00:47:37.020 --> 00:47:38.840]
Well, I wonder who gave him that kind of crap

[00:47:39.500 --> 00:47:44.160]
Because like I said everybody was the same age back in December when we were number one and then all of a sudden

[00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:48.520]
Everybody got real old in January when we had a really bad month and they got a bunch of wire diaries across the street

[00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:49.520]
I don't think that

[00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:53.320]
Necessarily is the problem although we might have some people who are getting a little bit

[00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:59.640]
Post to the end that was a query 40 is by far the youngest host of the daily show on Q a m

[00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:06.200]
Conversely the tickets got five daily host to our 40 or younger Rosenbergstein crants Le Bastard weiner aka

[00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:08.840]
Stubat's who doesn't belong on here to say hello or goodbye

[00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:15.380]
Shambi and Kevin Rogers who nobody ever heard of whose evening show easily out to a combination of games and talk shows on WQ a m

[00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:22.520]
And of course he doesn't understand hockey games and talk shows on Q a m hockey which had basically no number

[00:48:23.320 --> 00:48:27.620]
And anybody could told you that now we're not going to have any hockey after this you we're not going to have any Marlins after this year

[00:48:28.500 --> 00:48:33.140]
And the way things are going right now if Joe Bell doesn't get off his fat ass, we're not going to have any audience after this year

[00:48:33.140 --> 00:48:35.220]
But that's just him you know and the beesleaves and Joyce

[00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:39.140]
Two under 30 long term options for Q m would be Evan Cohen

[00:48:39.140 --> 00:48:44.220]
Well, I've said to now that Sarni's not writing anymore in the Sun sent a very jackass picking up the ball for Evan Cohen

[00:48:44.220 --> 00:48:46.560]
He must be servicing a lot of the sports writers in town

[00:48:47.320 --> 00:48:52.100]
We tried about it. In fact, is he on again this weekend? Oh, yes, Sunday. He's on from 9 to 11 Sunday morning Evan Cohen

[00:48:52.100 --> 00:48:58.880]
Tune in and you'll hear why it's not a good idea and ESPN radio 760 hosting Palm Beach who does part-time Q m work and

[00:48:58.880 --> 00:49:01.100]
Manage his producer Curtis Steven son

[00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:08.540]
Curtis is okay. Curtis is a good job on here, but what does that mean? What is he going to do? Is he going to be doing morning drive?

[00:49:08.780 --> 00:49:11.000]
I don't think so is he going to be doing afternoons?

[00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:13.380]
said Q a m's Joe Bell

[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:19.080]
This is the tenth book that tickets been on here. This is the first time they've beaten us and very slightly at that

[00:49:19.080 --> 00:49:22.980]
Nine and one is a pretty good record. We spotted 790 Stugotts winner

[00:49:23.420 --> 00:49:28.400]
We continue to go up they continue to go down or one and oh and ratings books that have come out in the last week

[00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:31.200]
Wow

[00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:35.980]
That's really something that's like a picture loses nine games in a row many finely wins a game

[00:49:35.980 --> 00:49:38.020]
This is what I'm one and oh in a last game and like that

[00:49:38.740 --> 00:49:42.980]
Like like the abluge is you know the lost nine in the world they win the next game. Hey, we won one in a row

[00:49:43.460 --> 00:49:48.180]
At a boy Stugotts your genius was rather rich daddy just like Joel Feinberg does and they're playing radio

[00:49:48.180 --> 00:49:52.880]
They're playing radio, but you know what at least at least they know how to compete they go out there

[00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:57.700]
They got billboards all over town the ones with the pigeon droppings and you notice how many comments we've had about that

[00:49:57.700 --> 00:50:02.120]
Mostly from stupid people who don't understand that that's the way the boards were designed. They're being seen

[00:50:02.120 --> 00:50:08.980]
They're being seen they are being seen they're drawing attention and they're doing and their cume keeps going up because they are promoting and they keep expanding their audience

[00:50:08.980 --> 00:50:13.800]
Our people keep dying or going away or moving away and moving away more power to them

[00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:19.040]
Now that's what's going on at this radio station and we have a bunch of people a bunch of sports

[00:50:19.040 --> 00:50:21.420]
Josh sniffing fools sitting around go oh

[00:50:21.420 --> 00:50:28.780]
What was us? What was us rubbing their hind legs together wondering what's going on over what's going on is you're not you're not drawing any new audience

[00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:30.660]
It's just incredible to me

[00:50:31.540 --> 00:50:34.660]
That anybody who really is serious about competing in this business again

[00:50:34.660 --> 00:50:36.400]
There's that word one more time competing

[00:50:37.100 --> 00:50:43.320]
Thanks to think the last time we had any promotion at all was I think we had billboards two years ago over two years ago

[00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:44.340]
Am I correct about that?

[00:50:44.680 --> 00:50:48.960]
I don't remember when there were Greg was still a butchering to place up and breaking it in a new minion pieces

[00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:55.240]
Busting the egg on the ground and then Joe came along like I said and stomped on it and all the you know the size of the pieces of the

[00:50:55.240 --> 00:50:57.760]
I they were there he just smashed it in a new minion tiny bits

[00:50:58.760 --> 00:51:03.300]
Here's the poll result. What's the source for most of your poor 903? I'm not gonna read anything in 903

[00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:06.820]
I just want to keep you a verse of the totaler to keep my Chris on his toes

[00:51:07.720 --> 00:51:13.420]
Yeah, maybe Chris can do a show maybe Josh Cortes can do a show maybe we can find some other kids out on their

[00:51:13.420 --> 00:51:14.960]
Maybe I do listen to that

[00:51:15.520 --> 00:51:20.080]
with you if they were talking about sport you would have to know about sports. Well then no obviously

[00:51:20.080 --> 00:51:24.020]
We can't have any other shows that aren't about sports. I forgot why to the staff know we got

[00:51:25.020 --> 00:51:29.940]
That I don't want to start slicing and icing and rip out a bunch of people, but you know, I mean where is it?

[00:51:30.020 --> 00:51:31.480]
Where's the beef baby? Where's the meat?

[00:51:32.820 --> 00:51:38.980]
And the fact that I don't and we got a show on Saturday morning night called jockstrap from 1030 to 1130. What is that show about Chris?

[00:51:39.540 --> 00:51:40.420]
It's kind of a

[00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:47.700]
Comedy sports type of a thing. I guess you would call it. Oh good somebody might listen to that. No

[00:51:49.060 --> 00:51:50.320]
No, well who does it?

[00:51:52.100 --> 00:51:59.420]
Sky Tom Alexander I think he does other Tom Alexander. I think that's his name something like that who now is that he does other things for us

[00:51:59.420 --> 00:52:01.900]
And so kind of like as a payoff we put the show on

[00:52:04.260 --> 00:52:08.240]
Well, what does that mean is that so in other words because he does he does what things for us

[00:52:08.240 --> 00:52:11.000]
He's servicing some of our people. What are you talking about? I don't know

[00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:14.260]
I just remember Josh telling me one Saturday when we were working on a

[00:52:14.940 --> 00:52:20.720]
Kane's game working a Kane's game that you know guys coming in you know and ask who was he said we do he does something for us

[00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:23.100]
I don't know if it spots or production or what is he does

[00:52:23.100 --> 00:52:26.300]
He's even clean out the toilets on a weekend when you know Rick is a janitor right there

[00:52:26.300 --> 00:52:27.380]
I mean, what are you talking about?

[00:52:27.380 --> 00:52:33.400]
He does something for us so therefore we put him on the air something. Yeah, exactly. So we put his show on the show called Josh Stratz. Yes

[00:52:35.260 --> 00:52:40.140]
Oh, oh my god. I'm not gonna waste anymore time. I'm gonna get into my pile

[00:52:41.540 --> 00:52:44.660]
I'm gonna get into my show because if I sit here and do all four hours on this

[00:52:44.660 --> 00:52:47.260]
I'm just gonna have a stroke right here on here. I mean, what's the point?

[00:52:47.440 --> 00:52:51.600]
I don't don't don't because I don't do it anymore. I have stopped doing that. Well, what's the point?

[00:52:51.860 --> 00:52:54.420]
These people are what they are they're not gonna change

[00:52:54.420 --> 00:52:58.280]
They're not gonna wake up Monday morning and get smart all of a sudden and you can't tell them anything

[00:52:58.280 --> 00:53:01.940]
You can't tell them anything and I just said you this as far as all of it

[00:53:01.940 --> 00:53:04.560]
Which a Rick had heard about the talk about extending my contract

[00:53:04.560 --> 00:53:11.460]
There are two chances of that happening anytime in the future none and much less than on and this whole concept that Joe Bell is obsessed with tapes

[00:53:12.060 --> 00:53:16.680]
It's kind of like it's like it's like it he has a death wish for this radio station everything that we've done

[00:53:16.680 --> 00:53:18.640]
It's ever failed. He's all for it

[00:53:19.240 --> 00:53:23.140]
Anything we've done that's ever good like putting George on when I'm not on you know in the summertime

[00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:24.580]
He's against it

[00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:32.160]
The day that there's a Neil tape on here on this radio station will be a cold day in Purgatory. I'm turning that right now

[00:53:33.780 --> 00:53:36.940]
And then not just to do with you. I'm just telling you know how I feel about tapes

[00:53:36.940 --> 00:53:42.020]
They're an abortion they're crap with reason they failed in addition to which they're dated

[00:53:42.020 --> 00:53:48.080]
They're dated the last time they were playing tapes that we do an alien in the pope okay tapes that we do out dated a hundred years ago

[00:53:48.080 --> 00:53:52.480]
Okay stuff that nobody ever heard of before they spread the material thin

[00:53:52.480 --> 00:53:58.360]
It's rehashing old stuff and the idea that they're gonna have a face of me reading on Friday on a tape of stuff

[00:53:58.360 --> 00:54:04.680]
I read on Monday stories that are older than Matthuslas great-grandmother you have to be a crazy person to think we're gonna be doing that

[00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:08.600]
What can we do to screw up this show too? What can we get it down?

[00:54:08.700 --> 00:54:14.780]
Yeah, like I said when you're on the Titanic no matter how good a swimmer you might be you're gonna drown and that's that's what's going on

[00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:21.860]
It's just a stunt and normal Kent you see the kind of guy I got working for me

[00:54:21.860 --> 00:54:25.720]
He's busy sending me messages about serious and about this one did this this one today

[00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:28.860]
What's that got to do with the price of beans in the fact we have no promotion on this show?

[00:54:29.360 --> 00:54:35.600]
Or on any show on this station and like I how many times are I said it even if Kenny and Bo were doing a phenomenal morning show

[00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:37.940]
What's that not but even if they were?

[00:54:38.820 --> 00:54:40.420]
Who the hell would know it?

[00:54:40.540 --> 00:54:40.860]
right

[00:54:41.980 --> 00:54:47.280]
How about a sandwich board on Lincoln Road Mall? How about hiring how about getting a Maddie Bell back?

[00:54:48.620 --> 00:54:50.000]
He's a little guy. He's a magic

[00:54:50.760 --> 00:54:55.220]
Just took a sandwich board over his ass and let him run up and down and Lincoln Road Mall

[00:54:55.220 --> 00:54:59.620]
I'll say if every QA I'm something five sixty turn it on you might like something we doubt it but you might

[00:55:00.380 --> 00:55:04.720]
Because all this is about guys who play games and get all sweat it up and take showers together and

[00:55:04.720 --> 00:55:09.020]
They give me the ball once the score into the house or what's his name doing now that's basically it

[00:55:10.820 --> 00:55:18.120]
And we have session with these with these segments with these guests and having these people on reading these live spots and doing 50 minute breaks and 80 minute breaks

[00:55:18.120 --> 00:55:19.640]
I mean all the things with the spots

[00:55:28.320 --> 00:55:31.720]
Nice looking maddie all spots video meeting they're taking our

[00:55:42.680 --> 00:55:49.800]
You've been broke my internship that your ratings and diet and how well I don't I show you what a big ass and I was till you

[00:55:49.800 --> 00:55:54.220]
And how you've done you can find somebody good enough to fill my piggy pants

[00:55:55.460 --> 00:55:56.340]
It's amazing

[00:55:56.340 --> 00:56:02.540]
I ain't no chance I'll ever be coming back

[00:56:04.140 --> 00:56:06.580]
I'm trying to consider a look where it is then come direct

[00:56:07.300 --> 00:56:11.320]
Mm-hmm if you want to know what it'll save you from shutting that transmitted the ground

[00:56:12.160 --> 00:56:13.600]
Why that's easy

[00:56:16.080 --> 00:56:16.560]
Sure

[00:56:36.580 --> 00:56:38.980]
You

[00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:17.400]
Oh

[00:57:17.400 --> 00:57:22.780]
1119 at 560 WQM from through or ranting and raving and carrying on because you started you're the one who put on

[00:57:22.780 --> 00:57:27.080]
I know that's right you wrote that article too well it's very jackass

[00:57:27.080 --> 00:57:31.280]
He got me all whipped up when I read that crap this morning. It's more propaganda and of course they've got their

[00:57:31.280 --> 00:57:35.480]
Patials in the media and then that's the interesting part of the whole thing is that they've got you know

[00:57:35.480 --> 00:57:40.440]
The bastards on the station and they got Greg Cotex who's on the payroll over there is on there all the time

[00:57:40.440 --> 00:57:45.260]
And they write stuff about them. We got all these other losers. What are they right about QA?

[00:57:45.320 --> 00:57:50.600]
I'm are they writing any glowing articles in there? I wrote windbag and Alex Marvez and who the other ones in the

[00:57:51.400 --> 00:57:55.760]
Monashia school Nick whatever that kid's name is. Well, what do we got? What are we benefit from that?

[00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:02.740]
They got the media in their pocket and so Barry Jackass gets on and he writes a bunch of swill about well

[00:58:02.740 --> 00:58:07.080]
You know younger and hip-hopper and inside the building at QA I mean I inside the building my ass okay

[00:58:07.080 --> 00:58:10.000]
How many broadcasts is because I didn't say the building horse still alive?

[00:58:11.160 --> 00:58:13.460]
You know so I added that thing there again who are still alive

[00:58:15.360 --> 00:58:20.620]
96 votes on that. Oh, this is the hour we go over a thousand. That's what I predicted then after that then they will fear us man

[00:58:20.620 --> 00:58:21.620]
I'm turned it out right now

[00:58:23.180 --> 00:58:29.380]
They got a two two in midday in a very upbook for them. They were skewed by a wild January and right away all of a sudden is a big story

[00:58:29.380 --> 00:58:31.440]
Oh, I got more new listeners than the Arages

[00:58:31.440 --> 00:58:34.140]
Yeah, you should live so long okay loser

[00:58:36.560 --> 00:58:39.300]
And in the meantime do we compete do we like go out there?

[00:58:39.300 --> 00:58:43.600]
We like to our horn a little bit. I think somebody's toot a little something on this place and it's got nothing to with

[00:58:43.600 --> 00:58:48.480]
Promoting the station. You know, I mean too much toot and go on. I'm not rooting toot and just too much toot

[00:58:49.920 --> 00:58:51.680]
You know I'm talking about you know

[00:58:55.180 --> 00:58:56.880]

Okay, I'm reaching over and I'm shutting that baby off. Oh, please don't

[00:59:41.520 --> 00:59:41.920]

Oh, I'm making over and show I shut now. Oh, no, I'm with whatever you do

[00:59:49.280 --> 00:59:52.640]
I'm really sick and tired. I've been doing this a long time

[00:59:52.640 --> 00:59:54.080]
I've worked on a lot of radio stations

[00:59:54.080 --> 00:59:56.920]
I've been doing talk shows for a very long time

[00:59:56.920 --> 01:00:03.020]
And when the management people and your agent are both indifferent and oblivious and sit on their fat asses and oh

[01:00:03.020 --> 01:00:10.660]
Geez wait screw it, okay? I consider him babble and read and ramble on and we can are you play bitchin for four hours every day

[01:00:10.660 --> 01:00:15.060]
I need that phone like I need bleeding big gigantic straw and hemorrhoids

[01:00:16.300 --> 01:00:19.880]
That's what I need to do that phone for okay, and didn't I say that a long time ago?

[01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:24.680]
We were doing fine when I wasn't taking the calls back in in the fall with no call and had a lot of balls

[01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:26.340]
Mm-hmm. Oh

[01:00:26.340 --> 01:00:31.260]
Well jolly jose is it so much better the way you interact with a call all four of them right all the colors all four

[01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:33.680]
Hi run

[01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:35.360]
Hi run

[01:00:36.260 --> 01:00:41.360]
What if I want to put them on here from two to four this afternoon sure be an improvement over that they talk sports

[01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:46.260]
They would be that's right. Maybe they can talk some sports. Hey run. What about the dogs and you run?

[01:00:47.340 --> 01:00:51.080]
Joe value are just abysmal and that's the kind of thing in fact

[01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:54.300]
You know something I don't even know I'm gonna go into a thing about him. I just have a message for him

[01:00:54.900 --> 01:00:56.700]
Yeah, in case you missed it the first time

[01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:05.600]
Just destroying everything right here like a tornado you like a car hurray came in

[01:01:08.740 --> 01:01:11.080]
I'm 33 on the pool, but we got a lot of spots

[01:01:12.300 --> 01:01:15.480]
As long as they can make money and keep paying the payroll. Let's all be clear about we got a lot of spots

[01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:18.140]
We got spots up the old dome nose

[01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:27.060]
Conservatives who paid $55 last night they are pundit and coder that nasty skanky right wing self-hating dike bitch

[01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:33.600]
Tear and coder badmoss liberal democrats and their ideas were not disappointed. What a surprise the author of godless the church of liberalism

[01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:38.360]
Spoke to a crime of about 400 at Southern evangelical seminary in Matthews North Carolina

[01:01:39.620 --> 01:01:44.600]
She called former president Bill Clinton a rapist referred to the chubby little legs of his wife Hillary

[01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:49.680]
And she said she likes to refer to Senator Barack Obama as be host whose saying Obama

[01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:58.780]
Sipping die token between her one two and three liners colder also invited presidents and governors to ignore insane decisions by federal and state courts

[01:01:58.780 --> 01:02:00.020]
Including the Supreme Court

[01:02:00.020 --> 01:02:03.620]
She also said that while she wouldn't justify killing doctors to work at abortion clinics

[01:02:03.620 --> 01:02:07.720]
She could understand how some people erupt and rage at their inability to stop abortions

[01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:11.080]
Some of coldest most popular comments were about religion

[01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:16.320]
She called the United States a Christian nation and dismissed Darwin's theory of evolution as a croc

[01:02:17.260 --> 01:02:20.920]
Another thing I like in a croc is French onion soup. That's what I like in a croc

[01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:26.300]
Other comments some of my lingo may not be familiar to you. I'm more of the political world when I say liberal

[01:02:26.300 --> 01:02:28.120]
I mean the devil she says

[01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:31.760]
Towards for anyone who says president Bush's presidency is a failure

[01:02:32.180 --> 01:02:36.440]
Roberts and Alito refer to the new justices on the Supreme Court who helped tilt the court to the right

[01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:40.500]
When the middle of a relentless Republican juggler know she said when the exception of Bill Clinton

[01:02:40.500 --> 01:02:45.980]
Whose newly opened presidential library is the first ever to contain an adult's only section when the exception of the decadent

[01:02:45.980 --> 01:02:50.400]
Buffoon Clinton Republicans have controlled the White House for a quarter of a century. She pointed out

[01:02:50.940 --> 01:02:54.520]
Don't let Democrats anywhere near foreign policy. She said there's always conflict

[01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:59.560]
Have been first when people who really don't like America ask to defend it for 50 years that Democrats have harbored traders

[01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:04.380]
Lost countries to communism lost continents to communism and refer to flag waving as an epithet

[01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:10.800]

happy friday to you

[01:06:47.320 --> 01:06:52.900]
We got gildy for the mad dog too. I know I know. Hey listen life isn't perfect. What can I say

[01:06:53.540 --> 01:07:01.860]
The Vatican is removed the Roman Catholic priesthood from the Roman Catholic priesthood two minutes served in southwest Ohio after considering evidence that they sexually abused children

[01:07:01.860 --> 01:07:07.100]
The art sizes of Cincinnati City yesterday. They sexually abused children must be another one of these isolated incidents

[01:07:08.260 --> 01:07:09.080]
or a bunch of

[01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:14.180]
Kenneth Schoetmer and Richard Unwin have been permanently removed from the clerical state

[01:07:14.180 --> 01:07:18.040]
I hope that Benedict XVI with his fancy little gay red shoes

[01:07:18.560 --> 01:07:24.820]
Schoetmer is a former pastor of Queen of Peace Church in Milville and Unwin is former pastor at St John the Baptist Church in tip city

[01:07:25.380 --> 01:07:30.160]
Can you tip this and a former teacher at Baden High School in Hamilton, Ohio

[01:07:31.800 --> 01:07:36.360]
They're good men of the cloth. Okay, and they like to dittle in with your kids. That's all I can tell you

[01:07:36.360 --> 01:07:38.660]
Remember the cloth not her 50 votes on the pool

[01:07:39.860 --> 01:07:43.300]
No, you can take it to the bank right now that phone thing is shot off in fact

[01:07:43.300 --> 01:07:48.880]
You know what I might actually do over the weekend. What's that just so I'm not tempted to uh dittle with that phone anymore

[01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:52.940]
I might just take the little box here, you know, and just disconnect and put it away and it climbs it

[01:07:52.940 --> 01:07:54.680]
And the monitor too

[01:07:55.780 --> 01:08:01.080]
All of the monitor was kind of spiffy up on top of the deck here with all the stuff on it. Yeah, it looks good up on there. I'll oh, you know

[01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:05.880]
It's probably emitting radiation when I have it turned on. I don't think I'll ever turn it on again

[01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:12.000]
Now I've tried to do that many many times before but when you're like only four or five people and this is this is their life

[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:16.040]
You know, I'm saying that I have the right and the most the point they're excuse for one

[01:08:16.460 --> 01:08:20.620]
But what is the point I give up you can try that exercise. I don't need it

[01:08:20.620 --> 01:08:26.640]
The show is better without it. I don't care what kind oh, but it's so much better when you get Reverend John's on air while George

[01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:28.720]
Yeah, well, that's very entertaining

[01:08:29.500 --> 01:08:34.260]
Very eliminating entertaining this place needs a blueberry animal. I'm telling you that right now

[01:08:34.260 --> 01:08:37.020]
Somebody's got to bring in the long you and I'll go out and buy the blueberries

[01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:42.720]
Because obviously they're not gonna spring forward anything you're cost like an extra like how's that thing coming at

[01:08:43.540 --> 01:08:48.740]
For the a fax machine. It's coming. It is one way or another. So it's Christmas baby. I know

[01:08:49.320 --> 01:08:55.280]
The drum bang that drum slowly by the drum slowly remember that's a by the drum slowly. Yeah

[01:08:55.280 --> 01:08:57.880]
I got my fill up there in the street quarter. I was doing 441

[01:08:58.360 --> 01:09:00.640]
Tick-kup taking up a collection right by Chuck Sobson

[01:09:01.540 --> 01:09:05.920]

[01:09:06.460 --> 01:09:08.220]
Oh, man

[01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:09.900]
Wow

[01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:15.360]
Oh fake come to Jesus meeting with Bush writes dog Thompson and capital blue. He's also pissed off and fard up

[01:09:15.360 --> 01:09:22.760]
I'm not actually pissed off or fard off. I'm pretty in good mood yesterday was sensational now we get out of here 1130 because it's five minutes late if we are

[01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:30.500]
I sure love it. I'm sure like that love. Oh, yes today going to the ballgame man. Yeah, it was great. I loved it

[01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:33.600]
I was dancing and you two yeah

[01:09:34.620 --> 01:09:39.040]
You'd appear to see me dancer man here in my box. I'm sure it was adorable. Yeah adorable

[01:09:39.820 --> 01:09:43.040]
Oh, yeah, adorable. Maybe that's why I'm such a good mood because I had all these

[01:09:43.840 --> 01:09:46.640]
offers cleansing experiences all these offers to

[01:09:50.040 --> 01:09:51.080]
Clean my pipes

[01:09:53.180 --> 01:09:58.140]
According to a this is dog Thompson. Let's get serious. I wonder if you think it's

[01:09:58.140 --> 01:09:59.980]
I can't talk about it in detail

[01:09:59.980 --> 01:10:03.260]
I think somebody ought to get their just desires

[01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:09.200]
Anybody have all some full any crap like that and I mean any anybody who couldn't see through that you know

[01:10:10.180 --> 01:10:16.640]
Anybody who's propositioning me on my blackery. It's obviously got to be looking for my yeah

[01:10:18.060 --> 01:10:18.500]
I

[01:10:18.500 --> 01:10:23.140]
According to a carefully orchestrated campaign of planted news leaks by the representatives who attend to the meeting a group of 11

[01:10:23.140 --> 01:10:28.920]
Lotta Republicans confronted George W. Bush and it come to Jesus meeting Tuesday over his failed Iraq war come to Jesus

[01:10:29.640 --> 01:10:34.080]
They claimed they told the president his credibility with the American people is gone when it comes to the Iraq war

[01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:38.540]
And then Republicans will bail on him if the war doesn't show significant progress by September 1

[01:10:38.540 --> 01:10:40.580]
Yeah, right says Doug

[01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:45.680]
While I believe a growing number of Republicans privately expressed it discussed with these scandals scarred and ethically

[01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:49.480]
Challenge president. I don't for a second believe the 11 who visited the president Tuesday

[01:10:49.480 --> 01:10:54.840]
Came anywhere close to telling them the truth about what a monomer your failure he is for their party in the other country

[01:10:54.840 --> 01:10:56.020]
monumental failure

[01:10:56.980 --> 01:11:02.420]
Kind of just like Clarence Darrow in the other room there monumental failure Clarence can you spell of can you say it?

[01:11:02.920 --> 01:11:07.060]
It was a tough meeting in terms of people being as frank as they possibly could about their districts and their

[01:11:07.060 --> 01:11:08.840]
Feelings about where the American people are on the war said

[01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:12.540]
Representative Ray LaHood of Illinois. It was an old holds barred meeting

[01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:17.320]
I know Ray LaHood we both worked as chiefs and staff members of congress in the early 1980s

[01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:20.860]
If he told me to look for some rises in the east I confirm it with the second source

[01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:26.840]
Others who know what really happened in the meeting with Bush say that congress people couched their criticism with so many caveats

[01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:31.600]
That they're gathering to him to do a little more than the exchange of pleasantries as important in the Washington post

[01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:34.840]
Davis stress that Republicans or Maine United against the Democratic bill in the house

[01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:36.800]
But the search for an exit is almost inevitable

[01:11:36.800 --> 01:11:40.980]
The key for everybody is to try to find a way to declare victory and get out of there he said

[01:11:41.480 --> 01:11:46.100]
The clear victory what alternative universe claims these coolest pretenders to reality

[01:11:46.100 --> 01:11:47.420]
Victory is an illusion

[01:11:47.940 --> 01:11:53.860]
The U.S. cannot and will not win this war in any attempt to claim victory will make this country even more of a life in stock on the world stage

[01:11:53.860 --> 01:11:57.920]
Two days meeting was a cover my ass with voters meeting for the 11 members of congress

[01:11:57.920 --> 01:12:03.360]
All face tough re-election campaigns next year because they voted too many times to support Bush's war and his other causes

[01:12:03.880 --> 01:12:08.980]
Representative Tom Davis's Bush's job of approval rating in some parts in northern Virginia is only 5 percent

[01:12:08.980 --> 01:12:10.360]
I'm surprised it's that high

[01:12:11.180 --> 01:12:14.700]
If these 11 particular political hypocrites really wanted to force the president's hand

[01:12:14.700 --> 01:12:18.760]
They would have voted to support the house plan to set a firm timetable for withdrawal

[01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:21.380]
They go to override Bush's veto of the earlier bill

[01:12:21.380 --> 01:12:24.920]
But they didn't and they said after Tuesday's meeting their vote against the new house bill

[01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:29.700]
That puts time limits on funding and benchmarks on real progress the war before additional funding will be approved

[01:12:29.700 --> 01:12:32.700]
Come to Jesus meeting my ass like the president

[01:12:32.700 --> 01:12:37.440]
They so blindly support these so-called moderates help crucify this country a long time ago

[01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:42.800]
Says Doug Thompson who's pissed off and fired up and says come to Jesus meeting my ass

[01:12:42.800 --> 01:12:43.920]
Like the main men

[01:12:44.900 --> 01:12:49.120]
Just like this company man the bees lays we're gonna be the best part station. I know

[01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:52.900]
You know something you know what they're real forgetting about the guys across street

[01:12:52.900 --> 01:12:57.220]
I mean as weak as they are believe me most of the day they are really weak weak

[01:12:57.840 --> 01:13:00.400]
amateur hour even Ted McWood ring that buzzer

[01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:05.680]
But when when we got from 11 to midnight when we got a you're fairy when we got a

[01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:08.060]
oh point oh yeah

[01:13:09.660 --> 01:13:14.200]
I mean does that you ever think that could be possible. I want thing to say about that

[01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:15.680]
Yeah

[01:13:17.740 --> 01:13:21.920]
Nobody we love the panthers shot off those games. There's no interest

[01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:27.680]
How about how about some part easy terms maybe we can get that on there maybe we can get more playing shuffleboard and both of them

[01:13:27.680 --> 01:13:30.560]
You can do the play by play while he's participating in the tournament. What do you think?

[01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:33.200]
Sure gotta be an 0.0

[01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:39.260]
And I've screamed and I've hollered and I've said here and I've watched it just you've

[01:13:39.260 --> 01:13:43.140]
Vaporate and they just you can't get through to the man for lover money. They won't listen

[01:13:43.140 --> 01:13:46.200]
They're intractable and immovable remember when clearance was in there the other morning

[01:13:46.200 --> 01:13:50.260]
And what was my take about the book and what are I thinking I said why do you keep doing this to me?

[01:13:50.580 --> 01:13:52.620]
Why do you come in there and keep asking me all the time when you want?

[01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:55.960]
I've told you a million times you won't listen to anything I say you will listen to nothing

[01:13:55.960 --> 01:13:58.600]
Because you're a simple ten man. You're a jock sniffer

[01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:02.260]
You want to go into locker room and you want to you want to look everybody's

[01:14:02.260 --> 01:14:05.380]
Privates is what you want to evidently or look the sweat off their armpits

[01:14:05.960 --> 01:14:10.060]
I'm supposed to be the faggot here and these people are are a million times more

[01:14:10.740 --> 01:14:13.780]
Involved in men's privates. It's all I know from

[01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:18.620]
His guys who are uniforms and sweat a lot and take showers naked together. That's what we're all about

[01:14:20.820 --> 01:14:24.900]
I'm here at 59 on the pole by the way. I think we're gonna be approaching a thousand by noon Chris aren't you excited?

[01:14:25.460 --> 01:14:28.080]
Oh definitely I can tell the sound of your voice

[01:14:29.580 --> 01:14:30.780]
He's my best

[01:14:31.860 --> 01:14:33.960]
How are you from extra thunder? What's your name?

[01:14:35.820 --> 01:14:40.520]
Oh, I'm a terrible man. He's got some dashes into the epsilon

[01:14:40.520 --> 01:14:42.720]
What's radio? 560

[01:14:43.820 --> 01:14:44.420]
QAM

[01:14:45.140 --> 01:14:47.200]
Why the you where still

[01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:51.560]

The baby's happy ever being better

[01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:08.060]
But all you'll ever see on the TV on the billboard

[01:16:08.060 --> 01:16:10.720]
is the coast or the sports or the weather

[01:16:11.560 --> 01:16:13.840]

They oughta know by now

[01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:21.840]
No one ever misses to that other crowd

[01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:25.080]
It's the talent that keeps the plays running

[01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:28.800]
Every time all they're gonna sound

[01:16:29.480 --> 01:16:32.020]
Let down is this music out

[01:16:32.020 --> 01:16:37.060]
And play this bass with us and out

[01:16:37.060 --> 01:16:38.180]
Ah!

[01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:39.920]
Tune it out, go slow

[01:16:41.100 --> 01:16:42.980]
What tune it out?

[01:16:43.540 --> 01:16:44.160]
When it down?

[01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:45.500]
Tune it out

[01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:48.020]
I know it's 75-0

[01:16:48.020 --> 01:16:50.240]
So I just sent Ricky Tiki a nice message here

[01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:52.420]
And wish him all the best and said it was so on

[01:16:52.420 --> 01:16:54.720]
50 years in a business man, it's a long time

[01:16:55.600 --> 01:16:57.080]
I got three years to go to catch up with him

[01:16:57.080 --> 01:16:59.120]
Think I'll make it three more years in this business

[01:16:59.120 --> 01:16:59.860]
In this business?

[01:17:00.040 --> 01:17:01.860]
They're back in the radio by the way

[01:17:01.860 --> 01:17:03.180]
Yeah, not about that

[01:17:03.180 --> 01:17:05.380]
13-0-0 at 560-WDQM

[01:17:05.380 --> 01:17:07.140]
Here's a sports story, baby

[01:17:07.140 --> 01:17:10.260]
Sports clearance is gonna get up on his hind legs and rub his legs together

[01:17:10.260 --> 01:17:12.520]
Rub his a praying mantras together

[01:17:12.520 --> 01:17:13.880]
The dolphins running back

[01:17:13.880 --> 01:17:16.240]
Ricky Williams tested positive from marijuana in April

[01:17:16.240 --> 01:17:19.020]
Will not be allowed to apply for reinstatement of the NFL until September

[01:17:19.020 --> 01:17:21.100]
Sources of total ESPN's Chris Mortensen

[01:17:22.220 --> 01:17:25.380]
Williams was suspended last year for violation of the substance abuse policy

[01:17:25.380 --> 01:17:26.820]
Was eligible to reinstatement of this month

[01:17:26.820 --> 01:17:30.000]
But the league's medical advisers that oversee Williams personal rehab program

[01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.200]
Recently notified Commissioner Roger Goodell

[01:17:32.200 --> 01:17:34.200]
The positive test sources be saying

[01:17:34.200 --> 01:17:37.720]
The doctors also recommended that Williams not be allowed to apply for reinstatement

[01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:38.380]
Till September

[01:17:38.380 --> 01:17:42.240]
The commissioner usually adheres to the advice of the medical adviser under the substance abuse

[01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:47.800]
Policy, so you don't think that those offers of sex on my blackberry were legitimate were sincere?

[01:17:48.820 --> 01:17:50.580]
Fallen off the wagon is part of rehab

[01:17:50.580 --> 01:17:54.680]
A source said based on the medical evidence in Ricky's case that doctors say it's too early to come back

[01:17:54.680 --> 01:17:57.080]
He had the positive test last month

[01:17:57.080 --> 01:17:59.700]
Memories been diagnosed with social anxiety disorder

[01:17:59.700 --> 01:18:01.560]
Oh no, that's a real disease

[01:18:01.560 --> 01:18:05.040]
And the good percentage of those folks self-medicated with substances like marriage and weaning

[01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:07.600]
Social anxiety disorder

[01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:10.720]
Often at the moment they're about to have a high level of social interaction

[01:18:12.180 --> 01:18:14.640]
Leaf spokesman Greg Ayelos said the NFL would have no comment

[01:18:14.640 --> 01:18:16.880]
Is did dolphin spokesman Harvey Greene?

[01:18:17.020 --> 01:18:22.320]
David Cornwell, attorney represented Williams during a substance abuse case, said he went out of the confidentiality policy

[01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:23.700]
In the fact with another no comment

[01:18:23.700 --> 01:18:25.780]
Nobody there all mom they got nothing to say

[01:18:25.780 --> 01:18:27.620]
Ricky Ricky Ricky, Ricky, Ricky, give me the ball

[01:18:27.620 --> 01:18:30.840]
Ricky Ricky, you know how that all goes and then of course through an occasional thing

[01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:32.840]
You got it all summed up the whole ball of wax

[01:18:33.340 --> 01:18:36.200]
9.78 in a pool we need 22 more votes, we'll have 1000

[01:18:36.200 --> 01:18:39.460]
And then Chris can slump back in a chair like most people do, fat people

[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:45.560]
If I want to instruct you this on the air right now

[01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:51.560]
This is an instruction, this is an order and you know me I don't give orders but I'm making an exception right now

[01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:55.680]
If any time in the next year and the hover many months this is going to be

[01:18:55.680 --> 01:19:00.800]
If at any time I decide to reach over and turn on that monitor and enable myself to look at the phone call

[01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:05.000]
If you're already, yeah I want you to like start screaming and carrying on

[01:19:06.060 --> 01:19:08.900]
That's right, making all kinds of weird things

[01:19:12.700 --> 01:19:13.800]
Like you got it

[01:19:14.440 --> 01:19:18.620]
Just to bring me back, snap me back to reality, you know sometimes you got to snap that's right

[01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:21.680]
Slap and snap it baby snap it back to reality

[01:19:22.260 --> 01:19:23.720]
Come back to the real world

[01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:27.900]
The phone on this radio station is like a cesspool

[01:19:27.900 --> 01:19:31.620]
It's like all of a sudden Alexander Graham Bell invented the cesspool

[01:19:32.700 --> 01:19:37.900]
I wouldn't wish it on Heinrich Himmler, Andrews, W. Bush and Anne Colter and Bill O'Reilly

[01:19:37.900 --> 01:19:39.080]
How do you like that?

[01:19:40.360 --> 01:19:42.580]
That's how bad it is, that's how evil it is

[01:19:43.680 --> 01:19:46.140]
All I know is come to a clock man, I'm going to lunch

[01:19:48.680 --> 01:19:50.480]
Yeah, that's something we're forward to you know

[01:19:50.480 --> 01:19:52.800]
Of course it is, I'm going to smoke

[01:19:53.920 --> 01:19:54.320]
Smoke?

[01:19:54.960 --> 01:19:55.360]
Yeah

[01:19:55.900 --> 01:19:56.400]
Smoke one

[01:19:57.280 --> 01:19:58.860]
Smoke my head off

[01:20:01.180 --> 01:20:03.880]
Oh, let us know when that baby pops off

[01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:06.220]
He'll get a memo, I'll text you right before

[01:20:06.220 --> 01:20:12.600]
The Bush administration is withheld a series of emails from the Congress showing that senior White House and Justice Department officials work together

[01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:19.360]
To conceal the role of Carl Roven installing Timothy Griffin, a protégé of Rose, as U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas

[01:20:19.360 --> 01:20:26.500]
The White House records show that decals Samson was then chiefed to staff with Attorney General Alberto Vio5 Gonzalez

[01:20:26.500 --> 01:20:33.080]
Consolid with White House officials and drafting two letters to Congress that appear to have misrepresented the circumstances of Griffin's appointment as U.S. Attorney

[01:20:33.080 --> 01:20:35.380]
And of Roves' role in supporting Griffin

[01:20:35.380 --> 01:20:41.160]
In one of the letters that Samson drafted, dated February 23rd of this year, the District Department told 4 Senate Democrats

[01:20:41.160 --> 01:20:46.460]
It was not aware of any role played by senior White House advisor Rove and attempting to name Griffin to the U.S. Attorney post

[01:20:46.460 --> 01:20:53.100]
A month later, the Justice Department apologized and ran into the Senate Democrats for the earlier letter saying it had been inaccurate denying that Rove would play the role

[01:20:54.100 --> 01:20:57.100]
Brad Berencine and I wonder if he's keen to read Berencine used to play a hockey

[01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:07.280]
An attorney for Samson said an interview that is client did not intend to mislead Congress, Samson he said signed off on the February 23rd letter based on representation made by the White House that it was accurate

[01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:16.800]
The withheld email showed that Samson's draft was forwarded to review the crisp, operasin, and associate White House Consol who approved the language saying that justice was not aware of Rove having played any role in supporting Griffin

[01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:23.080]
But an earlier email from Samson Opherson has already been made public indicates the two-man discussed Rove and then White House Consolid

[01:21:23.080 --> 01:21:26.120]
Harry Admires as being at the forefront of Griffin's nomination

[01:21:26.120 --> 01:21:28.640]
Liar, liar, your pantalinies are in fire

[01:21:29.180 --> 01:21:33.580]
You ain't seen nothing yet, did this whole thing is going to blow up and you know something? The best part of it will be

[01:21:34.060 --> 01:21:35.820]
Like right before the election next year

[01:21:37.180 --> 01:21:44.200]
Yeah, that'd be good because maybe then the Democrats can't you know grasp defeat from the jaws of victory although knowing them knowing the way the Democrats tend to do

[01:21:44.200 --> 01:21:45.240]
Have you ever done yet?

[01:21:45.660 --> 01:21:49.240]
Yeah, that's their greatest ability

[01:21:50.080 --> 01:21:52.020]
Grasping defeat from the jaws of victory

[01:21:52.600 --> 01:21:54.760]
983 on a poll were getting real close to a thousand

[01:21:54.760 --> 01:22:00.040]
And if we got a thousand listeners out there look by the time Jolly Jo Bell and Clarence Dero and Joyce Fitch

[01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:02.860]
See I never even got into that part and you're supposed to remind me

[01:22:02.860 --> 01:22:07.920]
Hey, don't forget about Joyce and the fact that we can't play anything good anymore or say anything good or you know even the drops

[01:22:12.720 --> 01:22:16.160]
And you see when you talk to these people it's like they're totally oblivious to that

[01:22:16.620 --> 01:22:21.360]
Well, we don't have the license yet and blah blah blah blah and this one and that one enjoys it

[01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:24.260]
And another thing is she took away from us have anything to do with reality

[01:22:24.260 --> 01:22:28.760]
The FCC has been in the regulations common sense that he was trying to understand

[01:22:29.480 --> 01:22:34.480]
And Ducci bag yeah, yeah, like that product that you can buy in the store we can't mention them on the air

[01:22:34.480 --> 01:22:38.460]
Duge we can say do just don't just don't put it in a paper or plastic

[01:22:38.460 --> 01:22:39.760]
Well, you know they come in a box

[01:22:40.180 --> 01:22:42.480]
Oh, do douche box me I know

[01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:44.380]
Well, nobody ever said we couldn't say that

[01:22:44.940 --> 01:22:46.880]
Duge box that's because you didn't ask

[01:22:47.280 --> 01:22:50.020]
Oh, well don't ask don't ask and then they won't tell

[01:22:50.020 --> 01:22:52.220]
Mm-hmm you douche box

[01:22:55.880 --> 01:23:03.080]
Well good it's the 21st century I mean I certainly less childish than Ducci bag and I was reduced to that you know do you know

[01:23:03.740 --> 01:23:05.000]
Don't be touchy ducci

[01:23:06.560 --> 01:23:08.000]
Isn't that the Duke and the Duchess?

[01:23:09.300 --> 01:23:10.100]
I don't know

[01:23:10.100 --> 01:23:15.340]
Well the Queen was just around the other day so it makes you feel all that worldly stuff you know it's on your mind

[01:23:15.340 --> 01:23:18.660]
Hey, no Ducci box what's wrong with that?

[01:23:19.160 --> 01:23:25.460]
No, you got to be creative because anything that's so interesting remember the day clearance came in and this is one when I was doing the show down there

[01:23:25.460 --> 01:23:26.640]
It's no the reason I don't want to be there

[01:23:27.900 --> 01:23:30.280]
Well Joyce's got a real problem with penis

[01:23:30.280 --> 01:23:31.320]
No bet

[01:23:31.320 --> 01:23:32.500]
Remember that?

[01:23:32.700 --> 01:23:35.340]
And there's something that was no bulletin to me

[01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:38.820]
That was absolutely no surprise to me at all

[01:23:39.860 --> 01:23:43.000]
Because that explains all the series of things you know

[01:23:44.800 --> 01:23:50.380]
And then I mean there's absolutely nothing wrong with saying certain words on the right

[01:23:50.380 --> 01:23:55.640]
You have to do with the correct text that's all but that's what you can say penis you can say vagina you can say this you can say that

[01:23:55.640 --> 01:23:57.220]
It just depends on the context

[01:23:57.220 --> 01:24:02.760]
Scum in any container has nothing to do with a sexual box that's right and douche box

[01:24:03.740 --> 01:24:05.120]
I guess you could put it in a box

[01:24:06.220 --> 01:24:07.780]
Scum that is

[01:24:10.820 --> 01:24:12.060]
97 on the pool

[01:24:12.060 --> 01:24:18.280]
I mean seriously the audience they think that at 990 or whatever they do they all think they're making that we're making that stuff

[01:24:18.280 --> 01:24:24.920]
All of the sudden I may be creative and legendary and stuff like that but I even I'm not that creative that I can come up with crap like this

[01:24:24.920 --> 01:24:26.900]
Who could have ever dreamed of it?

[01:24:26.900 --> 01:24:31.800]
The fart sounds on commercials for Rexall they have little dolls making fart sounds

[01:24:33.100 --> 01:24:39.900]
On over the air television on cartoons on kids cartoons on over the air television they're making fart sounds

[01:24:39.900 --> 01:24:43.120]
Oh now that was just a raspberry that was not a fart so you have to differentiate

[01:24:45.820 --> 01:24:53.240]
I could cry this place is being run by crazy people people who don't understand the business who certainly don't understand talk radio

[01:24:53.240 --> 01:24:56.120]
Who certainly have no concept of how you do phone calls on talker

[01:24:56.120 --> 01:25:00.400]
Oh let's talk to Ed in plantation now what do you think of the game last night Ed?

[01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:09.760]

[01:29:48.100 --> 01:29:54.300]

Picks that you queer, get away from that.

[01:41:41.160 --> 01:41:42.900]
Come on, don't try to change the subject now.

[01:41:42.920 --> 01:41:43.520]
Come around to the front.

[01:41:43.720 --> 01:41:44.260]
I think you had a weird feeling.

[01:41:44.260 --> 01:41:46.020]
And I'll ease into this, so to speak.

[01:41:46.020 --> 01:41:48.260]
Yeah, I have no idea how to grease into this.

[01:41:48.280 --> 01:41:52.380]
Oh my god, and you know something, anybody who'd be upset that I would reveal this to the world

[01:41:52.380 --> 01:41:52.840]
or anything.

[01:41:53.200 --> 01:41:54.860]
Anybody who would make such grotesque...

[01:41:54.860 --> 01:41:57.120]
It always tells people this.

[01:41:57.300 --> 01:41:59.540]
Pretend that Neil's ear is a microphone.

[01:42:00.020 --> 01:42:00.700]
Right, that's right.

[01:42:02.020 --> 01:42:06.460]
Listen, there are people who tell me things in confidence, and if there are people I respect

[01:42:06.460 --> 01:42:08.960]
me like that, I would never, ever repeat them.

[01:42:08.980 --> 01:42:11.280]
Never the less I tell them just to be safe, just to be sure.

[01:42:11.560 --> 01:42:11.900]
Pretend that they're hurt, mate.

[01:42:11.900 --> 01:42:15.980]
But, the heart, people are very obvious and transparent, and attempting to like muscle

[01:42:15.980 --> 01:42:17.540]
their way into my money and my life.

[01:42:17.800 --> 01:42:21.460]
I don't feel compelled to, I have no, I owe them nothing, you know what I'm saying?

[01:42:22.640 --> 01:42:23.080]
Yeah, I know.

[01:42:23.700 --> 01:42:24.860]
Am I right or am I wrong?

[01:42:25.300 --> 01:42:25.940]
No, you're not wrong.

[01:42:26.360 --> 01:42:29.400]
I know this probably sounds very convoluted to the audience who are just dying.

[01:42:29.600 --> 01:42:30.680]
They're probably like, oh, I'm over the top.

[01:42:30.680 --> 01:42:32.320]
They're hanging out, just salivating.

[01:42:32.720 --> 01:42:35.960]
Yeah, they are, and I don't know what all the pens I may just have to go ahead and tell

[01:42:35.960 --> 01:42:36.440]
the story.

[01:42:36.780 --> 01:42:40.020]
Or George may have to go ahead and tell it one of these days when I'm, yeah, maybe this

[01:42:40.020 --> 01:42:41.260]
summer is something for you to keep in mind.

[01:42:41.600 --> 01:42:45.200]
I'll try to, I don't know, I'll write an analogy or something, I don't know.

[01:42:46.560 --> 01:42:47.560]
1037 votes on a poll.

[01:42:47.680 --> 01:42:50.620]
We're not doing too bad on there, okay, considering the fact that Barry Jackis is right

[01:42:50.620 --> 01:42:52.840]
of business, even though we had a four one and they had a two two.

[01:42:52.900 --> 01:42:55.880]
And if you take out Janiwere, we had a five something, which isn't anywhere near what

[01:42:55.880 --> 01:42:57.040]
we usually do, but you know something?

[01:42:57.740 --> 01:42:58.220]
Big deal.

[01:43:00.020 --> 01:43:03.560]
We got screwed in Janiwere and they got a big kiss over there and right away everybody's

[01:43:03.560 --> 01:43:06.380]
got a story about a beep, but it will put them up and they're younger and they're

[01:43:06.380 --> 01:43:11.060]
hip-air and they're this and they're that and yeah, whatever you say, the fact is the

[01:43:11.060 --> 01:43:15.080]
business blows, the business is over with, and we work for people who are certifiably

[01:43:15.080 --> 01:43:16.700]
insane, make no mistake about that.

[01:43:17.460 --> 01:43:22.260]
Anybody who would suggest that taking Fridays in 2009 and 10 assuming that I would still

[01:43:22.260 --> 01:43:25.140]
be here, first of all, I got a year and two thirds left of my deal.

[01:43:25.260 --> 01:43:25.880]
What's the big hurry?

[01:43:25.880 --> 01:43:30.640]
Why would I want, based on what these people are doing now, I would have to be institutionalized.

[01:43:31.540 --> 01:43:34.380]
Hopefully, the different one that they're going to be, but I have to be put in a rubber

[01:43:34.380 --> 01:43:37.720]
room for me to withstand the contract again with them based on what they're doing to

[01:43:37.720 --> 01:43:41.560]
this show, not for the show, to the show and to me.

[01:43:43.120 --> 01:43:45.980]
And Ricky Tiki, man, I'm see he read my message.

[01:43:46.180 --> 01:43:48.760]
I congratulate you, seriously, man, 50 years in this business.

[01:43:49.020 --> 01:43:52.280]
I've been 47 years in this business and I can remember the days I'm sure he can't

[01:43:52.280 --> 01:43:54.220]
do when this was an exciting, a great business.

[01:43:54.920 --> 01:44:00.280]
When we had people programming stations who had imagination, who had balls, who had, who

[01:44:00.280 --> 01:44:03.080]
understood the audience wanted to be entertained, man, they wanted some excitement.

[01:44:03.820 --> 01:44:07.600]
Just like back in the days when all those great, we don't have any, yeah, we do.

[01:44:07.720 --> 01:44:08.880]
We got some oldy jingles.

[01:44:09.480 --> 01:44:09.880]
Yeah.

[01:44:10.420 --> 01:44:14.020]
I just don't know what stations are from, but like, I'll find one.

[01:44:17.280 --> 01:44:19.460]
Well, that's slow and more, but you know what I mean?

[01:44:20.040 --> 01:44:20.040]

[01:44:20.040 --> 01:44:28.800]
I'll tell you, go to the WFQM, seventy-one, oh, another hour on

[01:44:28.800 --> 01:44:32.620]
Skillik Rally, Rally, Rally, Rally.

[01:44:34.100 --> 01:44:40.520]
Solid gold hits, straight from the gold mines, seventy-seven, solid gold ABC.

[01:44:45.840 --> 01:44:48.720]
And of course, like everything else, and I can remember being on IOD the day that

[01:44:55.460 --> 01:45:01.220]
I was on the day that I was on the day that I was on the day that I was on the day that

[01:45:01.220 --> 01:45:01.340]
I was on the day that I was on the day that I was on the day that I was on the day that I

[01:45:01.340 --> 01:45:08.120]
was on the day that I was on the day that I was on the day that I was on the day that I was

[01:45:08.120 --> 01:45:18.360]
on the day that I was on the day that I was on the day that I was on the day that I was on the day

[01:45:26.080 --> 01:45:45.300]
that I was on the day that I was on the day that I was on the day that I was on the day that I was on the day that I was on the day that I was on the day that I was on the day that I was on the day that I was on the day that I was on the day that I was on the day that I was on the day that I was on the day that I was on the day that I was on the day that I was on the day that I was on the day that I was on the day that I was on the day that I was on the day that I was on the day that I was on the day that I was on the day that I was on the day that I was on the day that I was on the day that I was on the day that I was on the day that I was on the day that I was on the day that I was on the day that I was on the day that I was on the day that I was on the day that I was on the day that I was on the

[01:45:45.300 --> 01:45:57.980]
I was on the day that I was on the day that I was on the day that I was on the day that I was on the day that I was on the day girlfriend so far that topics was really way

[01:45:57.980 --> 01:46:07.200]

[01:46:07.200 --> 01:46:07.300]

[01:46:07.300 --> 01:46:07.460]
you all know

[01:46:07.460 --> 01:46:08.260]
you are seeing zoom in

[01:46:08.260 --> 01:46:08.600]
zoom in

[01:46:08.600 --> 01:46:14.300]
zoom in

[01:46:14.300 --> 01:46:20.220]
Brady Quinn and Tom Brady I'd like to have Brady's bunch but nevertheless.

[01:46:20.500 --> 01:46:23.600]
No, what? Huh? I got a lovely bunch of coconuts.

[01:46:23.660 --> 01:46:27.120]
That's what the script is saying and he made billions of dollars with no talent.

[01:46:28.500 --> 01:46:31.560]
Billions of dollars and here we got, look what we got. Pop out more of Griffin,

[01:46:31.660 --> 01:46:33.360]
look what we got. We got Jolly Joe.

[01:46:33.920 --> 01:46:34.520]
All right.

[01:46:38.160 --> 01:46:43.980]
I'm tied on the hand, don't lie. All the hard work.

[01:46:45.480 --> 01:46:49.360]
Don't go down every time I see.

[01:46:50.840 --> 01:46:52.660]
Don't go down every time I see.

[01:46:52.800 --> 01:46:55.140]
That's retard if you win.

[01:46:56.620 --> 01:47:00.420]
Don't go down all time to see.

[01:47:01.480 --> 01:47:03.420]
He's president of the

[01:47:03.420 --> 01:47:03.640]
****

[01:47:04.440 --> 01:47:09.340]
Rapub against bustle and in our take away idiot.

[01:47:09.720 --> 01:47:18.260]
I don't know why they wanted one just got a known easier person to make for you.

[01:47:18.480 --> 01:47:20.800]
Church with president of ****

[01:47:24.960 --> 01:47:35.200]
Oh, what I can do, go both on small and get me a voted one.

[01:47:37.960 --> 01:47:45.800]
Here you want this, don't go long, lips running stupidly.

[01:47:46.720 --> 01:47:51.400]
Don't go home, mindless drunk and rich kid.

[01:47:52.340 --> 01:47:54.620]
Don't go home, please even.

[01:47:55.300 --> 01:47:56.580]
Dumber than me.

[01:47:57.580 --> 01:47:59.740]
He's president of ****

[01:48:00.800 --> 01:48:02.680]
Yeah, don't care what it's all.

[01:48:03.140 --> 01:48:07.180]
You got him in by hooker and crawl up the Christian ride.

[01:48:07.560 --> 01:48:08.420]
No, what's best?

[01:48:08.880 --> 01:48:11.380]
You and I, but you're no fear.

[01:48:12.100 --> 01:48:14.000]
We've got a great leader here.

[01:48:14.920 --> 01:48:16.460]
With president, don't go.

[01:48:18.460 --> 01:48:20.220]
Holy Moses man, we got tourists.

[01:48:21.120 --> 01:48:22.080]
Residant of ****

[01:48:22.080 --> 01:48:24.320]
Don't 3205, 60, WQM event.

[01:48:24.540 --> 01:48:25.960]
The song is 59 votes on the floor.

[01:48:26.060 --> 01:48:27.340]
Our goal today is whatever we get.

[01:48:27.620 --> 01:48:28.380]
When you say on a Friday.

[01:48:28.500 --> 01:48:29.860]
Friday is here, down, you know.

[01:48:30.100 --> 01:48:31.300]
Friday is here, down, always, every week.

[01:48:31.700 --> 01:48:33.620]
In fact, Friday made a good day to play some tapes.

[01:48:34.620 --> 01:48:35.080]
That's starting.

[01:48:35.080 --> 01:48:36.120]
The toes think of now.

[01:48:36.900 --> 01:48:38.160]
Wouldn't that be good do we have any tapes?

[01:48:38.740 --> 01:48:42.800]
Oh yeah, nothing we can play because you know the tapes that we've already made were from the old days.

[01:48:44.540 --> 01:48:47.020]
Yeah, the rich and vibrant have stuff on them.

[01:48:47.020 --> 01:48:50.380]
And they have to be able to tell you some of the people might laugh their ass out and people might be by the road.

[01:48:50.840 --> 01:48:56.020]
We'll take a lot of like, we would have to go to play and listen surgically extract anything that anyone would want to hear from you.

[01:48:56.500 --> 01:48:56.860]
Right.

[01:48:57.160 --> 01:48:59.460]
Because that's the only way of destroying the show.

[01:49:00.480 --> 01:49:00.620]
Right.

[01:49:01.140 --> 01:49:05.780]
And when your first wild agent who's busy sending you a bunch of crap about serious radio that you don't care about,

[01:49:06.100 --> 01:49:07.700]
when he's busy, you know,

[01:49:08.500 --> 01:49:12.720]
telling you that Joyce will do anything in a part of the story of the show and then doing nothing about it.

[01:49:14.200 --> 01:49:16.020]
He is as impudent as a dead man.

[01:49:17.220 --> 01:49:17.660]
What's that?

[01:49:17.880 --> 01:49:18.280]
Morph Griffin?

[01:49:19.260 --> 01:49:21.660]
I've got a lovely bombshell coconut like hell with it.

[01:49:22.500 --> 01:49:24.560]
Yeah, since he mentioned it, I had a long way to play that.

[01:49:24.840 --> 01:49:25.760]
Why would you play Morph Griffin?

[01:49:25.880 --> 01:49:27.480]
Hey, Merr, you fairy got it.

[01:49:28.520 --> 01:49:30.640]
Well, and what about spinners and games people play?

[01:49:34.720 --> 01:49:36.160]
Yeah, what about it?

[01:49:36.160 --> 01:49:37.020]
Oh, man.

[01:49:37.500 --> 01:49:40.660]
I think Rick Shawlet and Firewinder you asked today by Kissing It.

[01:49:40.820 --> 01:49:41.620]
And you asked too.

[01:49:41.700 --> 01:49:45.180]
You know, that was really, really sweet considering that I learned about rock and roll from that man.

[01:49:45.800 --> 01:49:47.320]
Well, there was never feather in your cat.

[01:49:47.520 --> 01:49:51.940]
I pulled what's his name in there, Chris, to mark that down.

[01:49:52.320 --> 01:49:56.660]
I'm going to put it in my demo tape to get a job somewhere, you know, in radio later when this game ends.

[01:49:57.880 --> 01:49:58.280]
Yeah.

[01:49:59.960 --> 01:50:00.760]
This is great.

[01:50:01.100 --> 01:50:01.740]
It looks great.

[01:50:02.160 --> 01:50:04.260]
I love to read about the OGs, but it's pretty damn good.

[01:50:04.440 --> 01:50:05.000]
Well, I'll take it.

[01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:05.420]
I love this bit.

[01:50:06.740 --> 01:50:07.800]
Yeah, spinners doing it.

[01:50:07.900 --> 01:50:08.380]
What are you there?

[01:50:08.920 --> 01:50:09.240]
Spinners.

[01:50:11.040 --> 01:50:12.280]
I walk around.

[01:50:12.400 --> 01:50:13.340]
This doesn't fit a little bit of this.

[01:50:13.420 --> 01:50:14.020]
Don't get mad at me.

[01:50:14.320 --> 01:50:15.860]
Although not I Rick Shawlet's off the year.

[01:50:16.420 --> 01:50:17.740]
That's what capitalize on that.

[01:50:17.840 --> 01:50:18.540]
Hold me and open it.

[01:50:19.080 --> 01:50:19.400]
Right?

[01:50:19.660 --> 01:50:20.820]
I can play some crap about it.

[01:50:20.900 --> 01:50:21.960]
I hope he's a good one too.

[01:50:22.500 --> 01:50:22.600]
Yeah.

[01:50:24.180 --> 01:50:25.080]
Oh, I guess so.

[01:50:25.360 --> 01:50:26.180]
By the way, this is a guy.

[01:50:26.180 --> 01:50:28.420]
This is a guy singing like that.

[01:50:28.880 --> 01:50:29.280]
Yeah.

[01:50:29.500 --> 01:50:30.060]
I know.

[01:50:30.940 --> 01:50:32.720]
I didn't think so either the first time.

[01:50:32.940 --> 01:50:34.560]
I can't remember where I was.

[01:50:34.560 --> 01:50:35.780]
Spin all that day.

[01:50:35.800 --> 01:50:36.580]
Okay, that's enough, Chris.

[01:50:36.680 --> 01:50:42.240]
It just, you know, here's a fact that says the management or director, whoever the A-hole is,

[01:50:42.340 --> 01:50:45.420]
who Joe Rose going to first place, should be begging the big dog to come back in the mornings.

[01:50:45.960 --> 01:50:48.820]
And they are A-holes for putting goldstein on instead of Curtis.

[01:50:49.560 --> 01:50:53.460]
Nothing against Geldie's theme, but my radio goes to any other station when he comes on.

[01:50:53.460 --> 01:50:55.180]
I never listen past the end of the power.

[01:50:55.560 --> 01:50:56.540]
Hank is not for me.

[01:50:56.720 --> 01:50:58.280]
He says, Pee, whoever Pee is.

[01:50:59.140 --> 01:50:59.460]
Pee.

[01:50:59.460 --> 01:50:59.960]
Pee did it.

[01:51:00.080 --> 01:51:02.460]
I got a story about a Pee as a matter of fact, but I'll get to it.

[01:51:02.800 --> 01:51:05.040]
The guy that supposedly peed on the dead or racky guy.

[01:51:06.200 --> 01:51:07.060]
Here's another fact.

[01:51:07.240 --> 01:51:09.360]
Well, I tell you, Rich Shaw has got this town on fire, man.

[01:51:09.660 --> 01:51:11.480]
This is the second fact from the same guy though, Rick.

[01:51:13.100 --> 01:51:14.280]
Oh, don't get carried away.

[01:51:16.460 --> 01:51:21.080]
So he said, yeah, I had so many things I wanted to ask him, but he called like toward the end of the hour.

[01:51:21.740 --> 01:51:22.920]
And I don't want to carry him over.

[01:51:23.060 --> 01:51:26.000]
And I noticed he was online there when he was reading the message.

[01:51:26.040 --> 01:51:27.160]
So probably he's confangulating.

[01:51:27.740 --> 01:51:30.260]
I don't know if he's got a whole lot of people on his mind-space page.

[01:51:30.360 --> 01:51:31.780]
I don't know if he pays much attention to it.

[01:51:32.220 --> 01:51:35.500]
But he did send me a message, and then I responded to him and he read my message.

[01:51:35.740 --> 01:51:36.640]
And that's all it, you know.

[01:51:37.460 --> 01:51:40.920]
And I'm sure he's got 80's of the messages of best wishes and have a great life.

[01:51:41.200 --> 01:51:43.680]
And thanks for the memories and thanks for all the oldie moldies.

[01:51:43.740 --> 01:51:46.780]
And thanks for putting up with Bob Howell and making a play all that crap music on there.

[01:51:47.020 --> 01:51:47.480]
All the other stuff.

[01:51:47.960 --> 01:51:51.160]
You know, he didn't want to say too much about the business and the fact that it sucks.

[01:51:51.480 --> 01:51:52.320]
He knows that.

[01:51:52.880 --> 01:51:53.940]
He's been through the good days.

[01:51:54.700 --> 01:51:56.760]
And speaking of that, this fact says, how cool is this?

[01:51:58.140 --> 01:52:03.000]
Here's a little 10 minute audio sample of WQM's Rick Shaw recorded directly off the airwaves in 1966.

[01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:08.560]
It says, in those days QM was thought as number one rated station thanks to their powerful 560 frequency

[01:52:08.560 --> 01:52:10.920]
and awesome signal reached all across the state.

[01:52:11.100 --> 01:52:14.680]
But I remember those days, 100 years ago, to listen and play this on the ear,

[01:52:14.680 --> 01:52:15.440]
and we can't play it.

[01:52:15.440 --> 01:52:16.300]
Well, you could play it on ear.

[01:52:16.980 --> 01:52:24.600]
Lying thestone records.com slash form slash radio slash Rick Shaw 66 dot MP3, which we're not going to do it.

[01:52:25.280 --> 01:52:27.080]
Well, you have something maybe we ought to do it on Monday.

[01:52:27.780 --> 01:52:27.960]
Okay.

[01:52:28.620 --> 01:52:31.040]
You got the original facts you might want to do.

[01:52:31.220 --> 01:52:31.960]
I'm going to go look at it.

[01:52:32.020 --> 01:52:36.400]
Maybe you could like click on it in between answering Holy Moses.

[01:52:37.180 --> 01:52:42.420]
It says, interesting our mentions of Jefferson's Jackson Byron's and 39 cents for Dipepsy to make you skinny

[01:52:42.420 --> 01:52:44.320]
plus the clips of the songs are great too.

[01:52:45.140 --> 01:52:48.460]
Also, one thing QM did that was totally awesome and turned a lot of people into new music

[01:52:48.460 --> 01:52:51.300]
that wasn't heard in most of the country was the underground hour.

[01:52:51.660 --> 01:52:56.220]
This is where Rick Shaw introduced listeners to Spirit, Jimmy, the collector's cream, John Stilton,

[01:52:56.400 --> 01:53:00.960]
13th floor elevators, chocolate watch band, and countless other psychedelic and blues based rock groups

[01:53:00.960 --> 01:53:02.360]
before they became nationally known.

[01:53:03.600 --> 01:53:05.960]
I was going to ask him, but we didn't have any more time.

[01:53:06.080 --> 01:53:09.960]
I want to hold him over because obviously he's got a lot of people want to talk to him and a lot of fish to fry

[01:53:09.960 --> 01:53:14.420]
and a lot of cruises to play in and a lot of stuff to do and a lot of sleep to catch up on.

[01:53:14.720 --> 01:53:16.900]
I was going to ask him which part of the career was his favorite.

[01:53:17.080 --> 01:53:19.140]
You know, what, you know, right?

[01:53:19.620 --> 01:53:23.260]
I would be like asking me which station was the best and where you had the most fun and what was it?

[01:53:23.280 --> 01:53:24.460]
And I would say Zeta immediately.

[01:53:25.280 --> 01:53:25.600]
Zeta.

[01:53:26.500 --> 01:53:26.820]
Mm-hmm.

[01:53:26.940 --> 01:53:27.520]
With the zoo crew.

[01:53:29.540 --> 01:53:34.680]
Because it was FM because, I mean, we didn't have to go out and try to find people who listen to A.M.

[01:53:34.780 --> 01:53:35.380]
because there aren't any.

[01:53:35.860 --> 01:53:38.020]
We had like a building audience.

[01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:45.000]
It was in set with a real single, too, and a hundred thousand watts FM people were actually hearing this station.

[01:53:45.220 --> 01:53:48.400]
Drinking my coffee, and bungee and my tomato nut.

[01:53:48.680 --> 01:53:50.420]
We did a full of it, though.

[01:53:50.800 --> 01:53:51.060]
Oh!

[01:53:51.620 --> 01:53:54.980]
It's bad enough to throw it down.

[01:53:55.360 --> 01:53:57.360]
We did a full of it down.

[01:53:58.500 --> 01:54:01.880]
Why didn't you work in my room with a darling nail?

[01:54:02.360 --> 01:54:04.180]
We did a full of my diamonds.

[01:54:06.660 --> 01:54:07.460]
And three.

[01:54:09.200 --> 01:54:11.180]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

[01:54:13.560 --> 01:54:14.160]
And three.

[01:54:14.800 --> 01:54:18.520]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

[01:54:18.820 --> 01:54:20.280]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

[01:54:20.280 --> 01:54:20.780]
And three.

[01:54:21.280 --> 01:54:22.080]
Now, let me sit again.

[01:54:22.180 --> 01:54:23.260]
You can knock him all you want.

[01:54:23.460 --> 01:54:23.980]
And he's dead.

[01:54:24.080 --> 01:54:25.400]
He can't fight back, you know?

[01:54:25.440 --> 01:54:26.380]
He's going to win the same thing.

[01:54:26.960 --> 01:54:27.720]
But I still got a kick.

[01:54:27.820 --> 01:54:30.320]
I can kick the crush off him.

[01:54:30.320 --> 01:54:31.020]
I want to bring those.

[01:54:31.240 --> 01:54:31.800]
Very nice.

[01:54:31.800 --> 01:54:33.040]
By the way something speaking

[01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:41.940]
That thing that I was talking about I got it. Oh you got it. That's not like Ricky Tiki back when we made it

[01:54:41.940 --> 01:54:43.640]
Go on with your strategy one and going

[01:54:44.700 --> 01:54:48.860]
Go go play on Monday you guys we continue our year long salute to make sure

[01:54:48.860 --> 01:54:50.120]
I'm alright Rick

[01:54:51.220 --> 01:54:52.820]
He deserves a big tribute man

[01:54:52.820 --> 01:54:56.580]
He deserves the tip of that he does it filthy cat that he wore used to yell

[01:54:56.580 --> 01:55:01.380]
It's actually a dolphin game is my season tickets back when fat rich and I used to be the games actually pay for own tickets

[01:55:02.300 --> 01:55:03.980]
We're just a few rows behind him

[01:55:04.420 --> 01:55:08.260]
It ever be home dolphin game man. He'd be there and he turned around like tipped his cat to me a wave

[01:55:08.260 --> 01:55:12.360]
I don't know why I never went down and talked to him because I thought I back in those days

[01:55:12.360 --> 01:55:14.080]
I thought he hated me like poison you know

[01:55:14.760 --> 01:55:15.520]
Maybe he did

[01:55:17.420 --> 01:55:20.440]
Maybe that's what I love so well as we never talk very much, you know

[01:55:20.440 --> 01:55:24.100]
That's a good way to get along. Sure. No seriously if you never talk to somebody

[01:55:24.100 --> 01:55:26.440]
Have any arguments or agreements

[01:55:27.560 --> 01:55:28.800]
Fist fights stuff like that

[01:55:29.600 --> 01:55:29.960]
propositions

[01:55:30.560 --> 01:55:34.080]
For all propositions now you can get your propositions nowadays right on your blackberry

[01:55:34.080 --> 01:55:35.760]
You can be sitting there wood vinyl

[01:55:35.760 --> 01:55:42.160]
And you look on your readies bizarre messages. I sure hope he's listening today too because I'm gonna tell you not cool in anybody

[01:55:42.960 --> 01:55:46.660]
It's just yeah, you sometimes people don't know what it quit when they're ahead of the game

[01:55:46.660 --> 01:55:51.660]
You know I'm saying yeah, and they just keep pushing remember the song by the seeds you're pushing too hard

[01:55:51.660 --> 01:55:54.820]
You're probably got that the seeds that's the medley of their head smash

[01:55:54.820 --> 01:56:01.760]
I don't know what year I say 68 69 pushing too hard by the seeds you know, I don't have oh no

[01:56:02.680 --> 01:56:04.800]
You're gonna have to like create it now. How did you get that?

[01:56:05.940 --> 01:56:12.160]
Spinner's thing by magic George has got this magic wand just like I got the magic wand right and play those clips from like the godfather

[01:56:12.160 --> 01:56:14.620]
It's really I got this guy. I think you're

[01:56:14.620 --> 01:56:17.160]
So yeah, Juan and he's magical

[01:56:18.120 --> 01:56:22.360]
He's got he's got I have magic wand. I know some guys are gonna magic wand

[01:56:22.360 --> 01:56:24.720]
But right there you bastard

[01:56:31.260 --> 01:56:32.460]
Jim

[01:56:44.660 --> 01:56:45.860]
Alright

[01:56:45.860 --> 01:56:47.880]
She made show em all

[01:56:47.880 --> 01:56:49.140]
A right

[01:56:49.140 --> 01:56:52.240]
She won't man, he's a gay American

[01:56:53.380 --> 01:56:54.880]
A dean of

[01:56:55.920 --> 01:57:00.020]
Never knew why her hoodie had his bra all the time

[01:57:00.800 --> 01:57:03.640]
Said she always looked delicious

[01:57:03.640 --> 01:57:07.120]
And everything was fine and bad

[01:57:07.960 --> 01:57:09.860]
But she should have been suspicious

[01:57:11.060 --> 01:57:13.940]
Sometimes when they made love he called it red

[01:57:13.940 --> 01:57:16.920]
She married a nice show em all

[01:57:17.940 --> 01:57:21.080]
She won't man, he's a gay American

[01:57:21.940 --> 01:57:23.880]
A dean of

[01:57:23.880 --> 01:57:28.800]
This should be why your hoodie love burgers dry as sand

[01:57:29.640 --> 01:57:32.880]
When she told over the story

[01:57:32.880 --> 01:57:36.080]
A while he told her he was gay

[01:57:36.080 --> 01:57:39.640]
He seemed a better fit for more

[01:57:39.640 --> 01:57:42.620]
Only thing missing was the DNA

[01:57:42.620 --> 01:57:45.740]
She married a nice show em all

[01:57:45.740 --> 01:57:50.120]
A sexual man, he's a gay American

[01:57:50.120 --> 01:57:52.920]
A dean of

[01:57:53.640 --> 01:57:57.160]
Now you know why he went camping with his close friends

[01:57:57.160 --> 01:58:01.180]
And you married a nice show em all

[01:58:01.180 --> 01:58:04.840]
A sexual man, he's a gay American

[01:58:05.420 --> 01:58:05.980]
You're fair

[01:58:05.980 --> 01:58:09.520]
He used to dress like Peter Pan

[01:58:09.520 --> 01:58:11.800]
Because he's a gay American

[01:58:11.800 --> 01:58:13.960]
I think I'm going to start dressing up like Peter Pan

[01:58:13.960 --> 01:58:14.900]
Maybe I can fly them

[01:58:14.900 --> 01:58:16.980]
It's a lot cheaper than those damn expensive airlines

[01:58:16.980 --> 01:58:18.580]
Wow, they really soak you

[01:58:18.580 --> 01:58:20.400]
They squeeze the blood out of you man

[01:58:20.400 --> 01:58:22.440]
You know people that want to like spend a lot of money out of you

[01:58:22.440 --> 01:58:23.920]
I've heard of those kinds of people

[01:58:23.920 --> 01:58:25.280]
Yeah, they're called wives

[01:58:26.560 --> 01:58:27.260]
And others

[01:58:27.900 --> 01:58:29.640]
People that like text you every now and then

[01:58:29.640 --> 01:58:30.480]
Out of the blue

[01:58:31.020 --> 01:58:32.880]
Oh, that was a bad choice of words

[01:58:33.880 --> 01:58:36.700]
1247-13-1 at 560-22m

[01:58:36.700 --> 01:58:37.800]
So speaking of this place

[01:58:38.460 --> 01:58:41.760]
I was just thinking during that very weak Todd Pettingill bit

[01:58:41.760 --> 01:58:43.320]
It's okay, it's pretty weak

[01:58:43.320 --> 01:58:46.340]
I was thinking that the ratings

[01:58:46.340 --> 01:58:48.460]
We've been on the station nine and a half years almost

[01:58:48.460 --> 01:58:50.580]
And if you look back

[01:58:50.580 --> 01:58:53.140]
And go to the ratings since Barry Jack has this so obsessed with the ratings

[01:58:53.140 --> 01:58:56.040]
This shows that have had the highest ratings on this station

[01:58:56.040 --> 01:58:58.480]
Have always been the ones that are non-sports

[01:58:58.480 --> 01:59:02.020]
What do you mean shows this one and the Howard Stern show?

[01:59:02.260 --> 01:59:03.680]
Oh, oh, I forgot all about that

[01:59:03.680 --> 01:59:05.720]
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[01:59:05.720 --> 01:59:07.040]
Right, am I right?

[01:59:07.340 --> 01:59:10.560]
Well, yeah, far, I mean far way in above

[01:59:10.560 --> 01:59:13.280]
Even when there wasn't another sports station going to hey number, you know

[01:59:13.280 --> 01:59:15.060]
And to be very honest with it

[01:59:15.060 --> 01:59:17.300]
They haven't got any like big number over there across the street

[01:59:17.300 --> 01:59:18.380]
They've got a gigantic cube

[01:59:18.380 --> 01:59:20.100]
And all they really have is Joe Rose

[01:59:20.100 --> 01:59:22.140]
And the rest of it is just all window dressing

[01:59:22.140 --> 01:59:23.040]
And they're not fooling me

[01:59:23.040 --> 01:59:24.400]
Maybe they're fooling some of you people

[01:59:24.400 --> 01:59:25.220]
They're not fooling me

[01:59:27.220 --> 01:59:29.800]
Stoogots, when I start hearing about Stoogots, you know

[01:59:29.800 --> 01:59:31.520]
I mean, it just

[01:59:32.400 --> 01:59:34.180]
It just boggles my mind

[01:59:34.180 --> 01:59:36.880]
This is not somebody who's a radio person who's a broadcaster

[01:59:36.880 --> 01:59:38.360]
Who's got any knowledge of this business

[01:59:38.360 --> 01:59:39.660]
This is a child

[01:59:40.780 --> 01:59:42.540]
This is somebody that was a board op

[01:59:42.540 --> 01:59:44.640]
This would be like Robert Creeper, the grim reaper

[01:59:44.640 --> 01:59:45.400]
The Lord of the Board

[01:59:46.200 --> 01:59:47.400]
Being the General Manager

[01:59:50.560 --> 01:59:51.700]
What the hell is this?

[01:59:51.700 --> 01:59:53.480]
Oh, the series

[01:59:53.480 --> 01:59:54.280]
I'm blind

[01:59:59.280 --> 02:00:02.020]
I'm sure a lot of the guys know how to do this before

[02:00:02.020 --> 02:00:03.280]
Sure, now my life

[02:00:03.280 --> 02:00:05.440]
I'm not talking about the song, I'm just talking about the expression

[02:00:05.440 --> 02:00:06.320]
You're pushing too hard

[02:00:08.200 --> 02:00:10.900]
So speaking of that, let's take a look at that poll before I continue

[02:00:11.340 --> 02:00:12.020]
Irraculating here

[02:00:13.700 --> 02:00:17.060]
1077, what's the source for most of your porn or what passes for porn

[02:00:17.700 --> 02:00:20.060]
The internet, 696, almost 65%

[02:00:20.060 --> 02:00:20.980]
Almost 2 thirds

[02:00:22.620 --> 02:00:23.580]
DVD's 105

[02:00:23.580 --> 02:00:25.920]
Oh, there's the president with the queen again

[02:00:25.920 --> 02:00:27.540]
Isn't that lovely? With Queen Elizabeth

[02:00:27.540 --> 02:00:29.160]
Which one is the most constipated?

[02:00:29.440 --> 02:00:30.660]
Which one's the bigger waste of time?

[02:00:30.920 --> 02:00:31.880]
Which one's the bigger butcher?

[02:00:32.920 --> 02:00:35.660]
I don't watch 494, 8.7%

[02:00:35.660 --> 02:00:36.580]
Yeah, we believe you

[02:00:37.480 --> 02:00:41.100]
My imagination's 65, peeply in other people's windows is 41

[02:00:41.100 --> 02:00:43.740]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha

[02:00:45.680 --> 02:00:47.160]
Keepin' to thy keyhole, baby

[02:00:47.160 --> 02:00:48.120]
To the window

[02:00:48.120 --> 02:00:51.500]
Go through the keyhole, watchin' mom and dad

[02:00:52.100 --> 02:00:53.860]
He's been through the keyhole

[02:00:53.860 --> 02:00:55.540]
The most one we ever had

[02:00:55.540 --> 02:00:57.960]
Mom and dad were playing tag

[02:00:57.960 --> 02:00:59.380]
Right there on the bag

[02:00:59.380 --> 02:01:01.000]
Now let me ask you something

[02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:02.780]
I know the one part here

[02:01:02.780 --> 02:01:05.080]
Are you positive we can't play this?

[02:01:05.320 --> 02:01:07.460]
You tell me, we listen to the break

[02:01:08.120 --> 02:01:11.420]
If I recall there are a couple maybe three places in there

[02:01:11.420 --> 02:01:12.220]
where we would have to bail

[02:01:12.700 --> 02:01:14.120]
We'd have to bail out

[02:01:14.120 --> 02:01:16.160]
We'll go to jail, go to choice jail

[02:01:16.160 --> 02:01:16.700]
J.B.

[02:01:17.620 --> 02:01:19.100]
Mommy, you start foaming

[02:01:19.100 --> 02:01:22.300]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

[02:01:22.300 --> 02:01:27.000]
How about if we only play like a little, yeah, a little, like that

[02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:27.400]
And pieces

[02:01:28.380 --> 02:01:30.760]
Well it sounds like that's what daddy was gettin' a piece

[02:01:31.780 --> 02:01:35.500]
Anyway 1077, peeping in other people's windows is 41

[02:01:35.500 --> 02:01:36.660]
Video is 39

[02:01:37.200 --> 02:01:38.940]
Catalogs like Victoria Secret 15

[02:01:38.940 --> 02:01:42.060]
X-rated magazines, Playboy, Hustler, etc. 14

[02:01:42.060 --> 02:01:47.160]
Comic books 4 and Softcore magazines like FHM, Naxim, etc. 4 out of 1085

[02:01:47.160 --> 02:01:48.320]
Our goal is 1100

[02:01:49.120 --> 02:01:50.540]
I just made that up

[02:01:51.440 --> 02:01:53.640]
We've got that made in the shade, even Chris knows that

[02:01:54.720 --> 02:01:56.340]
Well, see if I only play like

[02:01:57.220 --> 02:01:59.820]
This could be a new way to play some of this stuff we can't play anymore

[02:01:59.820 --> 02:02:01.340]
Just like a part of a word, you know

[02:02:01.860 --> 02:02:02.520]
Like that

[02:02:03.060 --> 02:02:05.360]
Just be careful what word comes up

[02:02:05.360 --> 02:02:06.700]
But a part of the word

[02:02:06.700 --> 02:02:07.120]
Hand

[02:02:07.640 --> 02:02:08.040]
Yeah

[02:02:08.040 --> 02:02:09.580]
Is not bad, right?

[02:02:09.580 --> 02:02:10.540]
It's sad, right?

[02:02:11.760 --> 02:02:12.680]
Hey keep going

[02:02:12.680 --> 02:02:13.440]
You can't let me bother you

[02:02:13.440 --> 02:02:14.820]
I've got to go through all this holy Moses

[02:02:15.580 --> 02:02:19.580]
Now here's the fact that it says I've been listening since you were on Zeta up against Zuri Reynolds on she

[02:02:19.580 --> 02:02:20.740]
Up against Zuri Reynolds

[02:02:21.420 --> 02:02:23.740]
He was no compass weeness man

[02:02:23.740 --> 02:02:25.340]
He was not even minor company

[02:02:25.340 --> 02:02:26.340]
I am that hemorrhoid

[02:02:26.340 --> 02:02:26.620]
Yeah

[02:02:27.560 --> 02:02:30.500]
I live in Sarasota now says Mike Swach listen online

[02:02:30.500 --> 02:02:33.620]
My favorite time was when you were on WLD with Mike Veniri before you

[02:02:33.620 --> 02:02:34.820]
And Rick and Suds after

[02:02:35.260 --> 02:02:35.940]
Wait a minute

[02:02:36.660 --> 02:02:37.100]
Mommy

[02:02:37.540 --> 02:02:37.960]
Um

[02:02:39.660 --> 02:02:40.080]
Why

[02:02:41.220 --> 02:02:43.340]
Because I know what we're not here and so it's funny

[02:02:43.340 --> 02:02:44.600]
What do you mean what we're not here?

[02:02:44.660 --> 02:02:45.960]
I know the bit so it's funny

[02:02:46.540 --> 02:02:47.380]
Tandward Bobby

[02:02:48.100 --> 02:02:48.140]
Bobby

[02:02:48.140 --> 02:02:48.660]
Yeah

[02:02:49.480 --> 02:02:50.520]
Bobby for dollars

[02:02:50.520 --> 02:02:52.300]
I guess the apples may be

[02:02:52.720 --> 02:02:54.020]
Bobby for apples is good

[02:02:54.020 --> 02:02:59.180]
I don't know if you remember but I traded an autograph picture of Mickey Mantle Whitey Forge for an autograph for Ryan Sandberg and you scratched

[02:02:59.640 --> 02:03:01.540]
You scratched the take-out of the package

[02:03:01.540 --> 02:03:02.340]
Oh no

[02:03:03.600 --> 02:03:07.740]
I was even listening the day you were late because of the bridge in the bridge center guy called yelling at you

[02:03:07.740 --> 02:03:09.240]
You're the best guess I am Mike

[02:03:10.140 --> 02:03:14.340]
I'm friends with the organ player for lightning so if you want to come up to tell oh here's another organ offer

[02:03:15.320 --> 02:03:16.600]
This one on the fast machine

[02:03:16.600 --> 02:03:18.160]
Wednesday I had organ now

[02:03:21.260 --> 02:03:24.420]
Oh I bet you got Dave baby Cortez and a happy organ you got that

[02:03:24.820 --> 02:03:25.700]
I'm going to look

[02:03:25.700 --> 02:03:27.080]
Dave baby Cortez

[02:03:27.080 --> 02:03:29.540]
I bet you got that he's got that swinging organ man

[02:03:30.060 --> 02:03:31.240]
If you got it swing it

[02:03:31.640 --> 02:03:37.220]
Anyway if you want to come up to Tampa to see the lightning plate Toronto or the Panthers let me know we have four tickets in the fourth row between the benches

[02:03:37.220 --> 02:03:40.560]
Thank you Mike, go leave school I wonder if we got any hockey on my account

[02:03:41.660 --> 02:03:46.320]
Dave baby Cortez and that happy organ he's swinging it and people are talking about it too

[02:03:46.720 --> 02:03:47.240]
That's right

[02:03:47.240 --> 02:03:48.760]
And you have a happy organ

[02:03:49.320 --> 02:03:50.480]
You have a happy mind

[02:03:50.480 --> 02:03:50.900]
That's right

[02:03:52.980 --> 02:03:53.820]
I'm finding it

[02:03:53.820 --> 02:03:58.240]
Well that's what the gist wasn't that message he got here today

[02:03:58.240 --> 02:03:58.820]
Uh-huh

[02:03:58.820 --> 02:04:00.360]
Would you like a happy organ?

[02:04:01.620 --> 02:04:02.060]
Yeah

[02:04:02.820 --> 02:04:05.080]
It was somebody that wanted to make that organ happy

[02:04:05.080 --> 02:04:05.720]
I know

[02:04:06.240 --> 02:04:07.140]
No, no team

[02:04:07.780 --> 02:04:08.660]
My pen

[02:04:08.660 --> 02:04:09.820]
Play it on it

[02:04:12.700 --> 02:04:13.520]
Okay that's enough

[02:04:13.520 --> 02:04:16.000]
That's a good song happy and that's a good instrumentals

[02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:17.200]
It's cute

[02:04:18.100 --> 02:04:19.080]
What do you mean it's cute

[02:04:19.080 --> 02:04:19.880]
It's cute

[02:04:20.740 --> 02:04:22.700]
Now let me ask you this question seriously

[02:04:23.240 --> 02:04:25.440]
Why would anybody answer now?

[02:04:25.440 --> 02:04:28.060]
What are you going to do because when you're on you do the phones you know you

[02:04:28.060 --> 02:04:28.400]
Right

[02:04:28.400 --> 02:04:29.520]
What are you going to do?

[02:04:29.720 --> 02:04:30.140]
I'll continue

[02:04:30.680 --> 02:04:31.480]
Taking the calls

[02:04:31.480 --> 02:04:31.920]
Right

[02:04:31.920 --> 02:04:33.480]
Or you're a crazy person

[02:04:33.480 --> 02:04:34.380]
There's no question

[02:04:34.380 --> 02:04:35.500]
Just look at me

[02:04:36.580 --> 02:04:40.420]
Well I'm serious it's really very sad because what's happened here

[02:04:40.420 --> 02:04:45.200]
And how many how long have I been screaming and carrying on and just waiting about this

[02:04:45.200 --> 02:04:49.440]
Both on and off the ear and as they say in China, Gourmet's Health and

[02:04:49.440 --> 02:04:52.800]
They just don't care they just don't want to make the effort and of course

[02:04:52.800 --> 02:04:55.760]
Joyce if you think we're getting any cooperation from that pitch

[02:04:55.760 --> 02:04:58.060]
And Robert Kent meanwhile is too busy awarded by you know

[02:04:58.060 --> 02:05:00.400]
A craft that has nothing to do with me you know

[02:05:00.840 --> 02:05:01.480]
But nonsense

[02:05:01.480 --> 02:05:02.940]
With being a news

[02:05:02.940 --> 02:05:08.180]
And addition to which there's somebody on my my space there who I guess thinks that he's being very helpful

[02:05:08.180 --> 02:05:10.940]
I'm trying to think he's got like a Mickey Mouse he has never real profile

[02:05:12.120 --> 02:05:13.880]
And he keeps sending me all these news stories

[02:05:13.880 --> 02:05:18.760]
Which a lot of them are pretty good and I've used many of them on the ear but it's just it's reached to the point where just too much

[02:05:19.220 --> 02:05:19.840]
You know what I mean?

[02:05:20.100 --> 02:05:20.320]
Too much

[02:05:20.320 --> 02:05:21.100]
I do know you mean

[02:05:21.520 --> 02:05:22.580]
You follow what I'm saying

[02:05:23.680 --> 02:05:28.040]
And sorry sometimes I can be like that or send too much mush or just too much or just you know

[02:05:28.040 --> 02:05:29.160]
Give it to you away

[02:05:29.160 --> 02:05:30.920]
We're not going to be that

[02:05:31.360 --> 02:05:32.540]
We're all guilty or what?

[02:05:32.960 --> 02:05:34.220]
Being too muchy sometimes

[02:05:34.800 --> 02:05:37.500]
Oh well you know my intentions are always good though

[02:05:37.500 --> 02:05:37.920]
That's right

[02:05:38.500 --> 02:05:40.340]
I'm a good guy just ask me and I'll tell you

[02:05:40.340 --> 02:05:44.140]
And maybe that's why I was getting that message around Wednesday and then again yesterday you know I mean

[02:05:44.140 --> 02:05:47.440]
What's wrong with that? It's a good idea maybe you got some money for me

[02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:51.420]
What? In fact yesterday you should have straightened that all out

[02:05:51.880 --> 02:05:52.560]
You should

[02:05:52.560 --> 02:05:55.020]
I don't know anything about it what are you talking about?

[02:05:55.020 --> 02:05:56.180]
What do you mean you don't know anything about it?

[02:05:56.180 --> 02:05:58.700]
I don't know what my official story everybody that I know

[02:05:58.700 --> 02:05:59.220]
I know

[02:05:59.220 --> 02:06:03.540]
I even went out on the street and downtown Toronto went to the Eden Center and I got a megaphone

[02:06:03.540 --> 02:06:07.840]
And I said you have to leave what happened to me at Woodbuy Wednesday I was getting messages on my crackberry

[02:06:07.840 --> 02:06:08.200]
Right

[02:06:08.200 --> 02:06:09.920]
I was getting profusitioned on there

[02:06:09.920 --> 02:06:12.080]
Well I have no intention of going there girlfriend

[02:06:12.480 --> 02:06:14.800]
What do you want to do open up your windows and yell it up to the street

[02:06:15.520 --> 02:06:16.840]
I'm going to do that right now

[02:06:16.840 --> 02:06:17.860]
Hey guess what?

[02:06:18.840 --> 02:06:20.260]
Hey how's it going hey?

[02:06:21.620 --> 02:06:22.840]
These people here are so freaking nice

[02:06:22.840 --> 02:06:27.820]
Not not all of them there's some idiots here like there are anywhere because there's five million people here so there's got to be idiots

[02:06:27.820 --> 02:06:30.480]
But they are so nice and so polite and so damn friendly

[02:06:30.480 --> 02:06:32.420]
And many of them are so

[02:06:34.020 --> 02:06:34.900]
Oh God

[02:06:35.340 --> 02:06:39.560]
See that's why we don't need any ass systems from anybody who's done this writing to us

[02:06:40.200 --> 02:06:42.280]
Huchi kuchi messages on my crackberry

[02:06:43.020 --> 02:06:46.880]
You had to admit that was one of the even though we can't it's a success on the earth yet

[02:06:46.880 --> 02:06:48.800]
It was surreal

[02:06:48.800 --> 02:06:49.340]
Yeah

[02:06:50.720 --> 02:06:52.360]
Unleaveable as some people would say

[02:06:52.360 --> 02:06:54.360]
Which is what compelled me to write all about it

[02:06:54.360 --> 02:06:54.660]
I believe

[02:06:55.520 --> 02:06:55.880]
What?

[02:06:56.620 --> 02:06:56.880]
I said

[02:06:56.880 --> 02:06:57.140]
Un

[02:06:57.720 --> 02:06:58.440]
I believeable

[02:06:58.900 --> 02:07:00.040]
Tell everybody that I know

[02:07:00.940 --> 02:07:04.920]
I wrote it all in all detail I wrote it to Brandon I wrote the professor and I wrote it

[02:07:04.920 --> 02:07:05.920]
What are you laughing about?

[02:07:06.880 --> 02:07:09.560]
I did I took me a lot of time to write that whole story

[02:07:09.560 --> 02:07:11.780]
I had to write a whole background thing on it and I wrote

[02:07:12.280 --> 02:07:13.800]
I thought about the people too

[02:07:14.720 --> 02:07:15.460]
Don't forget what?

[02:07:16.140 --> 02:07:17.680]
I said I told a couple people too

[02:07:17.680 --> 02:07:18.300]
Did you really?

[02:07:18.680 --> 02:07:18.920]
Yeah

[02:07:18.920 --> 02:07:20.260]
Oh good that's good

[02:07:20.260 --> 02:07:21.540]
And who else did I tell about it?

[02:07:21.580 --> 02:07:26.540]
And of course I told it to my close personal friends down there which you know one of them and one of me like one of me don't

[02:07:26.540 --> 02:07:26.760]
Right

[02:07:26.760 --> 02:07:28.480]
But anyway I told my wife and my mistress

[02:07:30.040 --> 02:07:31.680]
Did tell your kids about it?

[02:07:31.940 --> 02:07:32.360]
No no

[02:07:34.020 --> 02:07:37.740]
1097 when the break is over we'll have over 1100 votes which isn't too bad

[02:07:37.740 --> 02:07:44.160]
And the very jackass by the way continues to be a quizzling as long as I live I'll never forget that they have pierced the international airport in Toronto

[02:07:44.160 --> 02:07:47.840]
I'm going home after weekend here whatever and near I see very well

[02:07:47.840 --> 02:07:49.460]
I didn't even know him at the time he walks up to me

[02:07:49.460 --> 02:07:53.680]
Oh hi Neil I'm very jackass I just want to tell you a lot of what you say about me is true

[02:07:53.680 --> 02:07:54.940]
And I looked at him and I went

[02:07:54.940 --> 02:07:55.940]
Do fair anyway

[02:07:55.940 --> 02:07:56.440]
Uh huh

[02:07:56.440 --> 02:07:58.340]
Uh huh like that just like John Levin

[02:07:58.340 --> 02:07:58.980]
Uh huh

[02:08:00.020 --> 02:08:00.940]
What's just happened there?

[02:08:00.960 --> 02:08:01.960]
Oh don't tell me I knocked that down

[02:08:01.960 --> 02:08:03.580]
Oh that's because I still got this going

[02:08:03.580 --> 02:08:06.080]
And Jill most got whiplash

[02:08:06.740 --> 02:08:07.560]
I don't know what

[02:08:07.560 --> 02:08:11.680]
I almost got whiplash

[02:08:11.680 --> 02:08:13.780]
And she always got whiplash

[02:08:13.780 --> 02:08:16.040]
Oh brother I'm going to play the whole thing one of these days

[02:08:16.040 --> 02:08:17.680]
Okay just got the rail

[02:08:17.680 --> 02:08:21.160]
And when I'm up in Boca Tiga slapping all the women with painted lips around the pole

[02:08:21.160 --> 02:08:23.000]
I listen to the Neil Rogers one to two

[02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:27.160]
I mean I listen to the Neil Rogers air and balance one to two hours

[02:08:27.700 --> 02:08:28.100]
Woooah

[02:08:39.020 --> 02:08:43.460]
So the next time you're on the toilet

[02:08:44.080 --> 02:08:45.340]
Back down

[02:08:46.080 --> 02:08:49.900]
There's a way you can save the planet

[02:08:51.060 --> 02:08:54.100]
When you clean yourself too

[02:08:54.100 --> 02:08:55.640]
It just wants

[02:08:55.640 --> 02:09:00.560]
But you kind of want to work again

[02:09:00.560 --> 02:09:01.660]
Why?

[02:09:01.660 --> 02:09:07.660]
Baby you want to work again but just don't

[02:09:09.940 --> 02:09:10.520]
Oh

[02:09:11.660 --> 02:09:14.540]
One square is the greenness

[02:09:14.540 --> 02:09:20.860]
When you can't wipe one square is the greenness

[02:09:21.660 --> 02:09:25.760]
If you love the planet you won't use more

[02:09:27.680 --> 02:09:31.600]
Everybody will wipe like me and I'll go

[02:09:34.720 --> 02:09:37.760]
One square is the greenness

[02:09:38.740 --> 02:09:43.760]
Think when you wipe one square is the greenness

[02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:49.880]
So come on everyone do your part

[02:09:51.920 --> 02:09:56.080]
Even if you wonder with some skin marks

[02:09:56.080 --> 02:10:05.340]
I mean I know she's a crazy person but is she really serious with this whole one square she'll end the chrome?

[02:10:05.680 --> 02:10:07.620]
Yeah she really is

[02:10:08.740 --> 02:10:12.160]
Just just think about that for about a second and we can say not bad right?

[02:10:12.720 --> 02:10:14.460]
No I can say a new box

[02:10:15.300 --> 02:10:16.340]
Not box

[02:10:17.140 --> 02:10:19.320]
If she a new box or a new box

[02:10:19.320 --> 02:10:22.140]
She's a new box bag

[02:10:23.100 --> 02:10:28.220]
What do you think we say we go for 1200 christ?

[02:10:29.180 --> 02:10:29.420]
No

[02:10:29.420 --> 02:10:31.260]
Yeah why not?

[02:10:31.260 --> 02:10:35.900]
I think you're crazy it's a Friday afternoon it's the 11th of May

[02:10:36.460 --> 02:10:38.900]
It's tomorrow is a week after El Cinco de Mayo

[02:10:42.220 --> 02:10:46.680]
This is Mark and I was thinking about since I'm not taking any calls for the next 600 weeks

[02:10:46.680 --> 02:10:50.480]
What I'm going to do is I think I'm going to hold an hour windbag and Alice Marvaz

[02:10:51.100 --> 02:10:53.740]
Some of the guys that have made the other day part so strong

[02:10:53.740 --> 02:10:55.360]
And we can get them on the show

[02:10:55.360 --> 02:10:58.760]
And we can sell the show and their segments

[02:10:58.760 --> 02:11:00.200]
Add them to their own live spot

[02:11:00.200 --> 02:11:01.840]
Let's get some filler material in here

[02:11:01.840 --> 02:11:02.160]
Right

[02:11:03.700 --> 02:11:07.420]
People who nobody reads their columns and newspapers in the first place

[02:11:07.420 --> 02:11:08.640]
But let's put them on the radio

[02:11:08.640 --> 02:11:12.660]
They're not broadcasters and in fact that qualifies them to be on both of these radio stations

[02:11:12.660 --> 02:11:15.200]
This one and the one that they're so obsessed with across the street

[02:11:15.200 --> 02:11:18.280]
They're not worrying about competing with because they never even come close to our number

[02:11:18.280 --> 02:11:20.360]
And they're not a sports show

[02:11:22.520 --> 02:11:23.980]
Doesn't that kind of sum it up right there?

[02:11:24.020 --> 02:11:27.520]
The fact that they're always worried about what did the other place do in mid-day

[02:11:27.520 --> 02:11:29.200]
We're not a sports show here

[02:11:29.200 --> 02:11:30.440]
That's not our competition

[02:11:33.020 --> 02:11:35.580]
Wouldn't anybody who understands talk radio know that?

[02:11:36.680 --> 02:11:38.120]
What? What did you just say?

[02:11:38.760 --> 02:11:40.540]
Anybody who understands talk radio

[02:11:40.540 --> 02:11:44.960]
See that was the after the phrase that they were supposed to grab onto just grab onto the brass ring

[02:11:46.560 --> 02:11:51.460]
But they don't get it. They have no background in it. They don't understand it. And of course when you put a Clarence Vera

[02:11:51.460 --> 02:11:54.460]
Who's like a 10 year old child in an older body when you put him in charge

[02:11:54.460 --> 02:11:58.020]
You know that Gornisch-Telfin, you know it's a lost cause

[02:11:59.460 --> 02:12:01.780]
So I'm just going to show up every day and we'll do a fine job

[02:12:02.400 --> 02:12:06.440]
And I'm not taking any calls and I'm listening until they want to do something about that situation

[02:12:06.440 --> 02:12:10.360]
And the Volcan for the Endless situation he could squash all three or four of those people

[02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:12.040]
No that situation?

[02:12:12.760 --> 02:12:13.980]
No, what is it?

[02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:15.860]
Well whatever he's always talking about the situation

[02:12:15.860 --> 02:12:18.840]
You better get with him Mr. You're not following your Kimba Volcan for material

[02:12:18.840 --> 02:12:20.280]
I bet your Chris understood that

[02:12:20.840 --> 02:12:21.700]
Oh yes, I know

[02:12:22.340 --> 02:12:23.300]
You didn't? No

[02:12:23.300 --> 02:12:25.100]
You didn't understand that situation

[02:12:26.100 --> 02:12:31.340]
Well the least chicken neck does cause he's always making fun of that cause Kimba's always saying what are the adult in situation

[02:12:31.340 --> 02:12:32.400]
He always says that

[02:12:32.400 --> 02:12:39.120]
And you notice that once again chicken that creates characters that are much more interesting and much more much funnier than the original one

[02:12:41.360 --> 02:12:44.380]
They would listen to me about that we might have had a number somewhere along the line

[02:12:44.380 --> 02:12:45.560]
But oh no, you know

[02:12:46.860 --> 02:12:49.500]
Anger that it be loved member of his squad have been killed in the explosion

[02:12:49.500 --> 02:12:55.860]
The US Marine urinated on one of the 24 dead Iraqi civilians killed by his unit in Haditha the more testified Wednesday

[02:12:55.860 --> 02:12:57.840]
He peed on him

[02:12:57.840 --> 02:13:03.320]
Sargent Sandic Delacruz, who has immunity from prosecution after murder charges against him were dismissed

[02:13:03.320 --> 02:13:08.660]
Also said he watched his squad leader shoot down five Iraqi civilians who were trying to surrender

[02:13:09.740 --> 02:13:15.720]
In dramatic testimony in a pre-traumat hearing form of the seven Marines Sargent in November 2005 Haditha killings and les cover up

[02:13:15.720 --> 02:13:22.680]
Delacruz described his bitterness after Rostra Vom ripped Lance Corporal Miguel Tarazaz known as TJ into two bloody pieces

[02:13:23.880 --> 02:13:31.000]
I know it was a bad thing what I've done but I've done it cause I was angry TJ was dead and I peed he didn't say peed but I can't say the other word

[02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:32.720]
I peed on one Iraqi's head

[02:13:32.720 --> 02:13:36.340]
Said an unemotional Delacruz I mean talk about illiterate

[02:13:36.860 --> 02:13:43.120]
I know it was a bad thing what I've done but I've done it cause I was angry TJ was dead and I peed on one Iraqi's head

[02:13:43.120 --> 02:13:45.100]
Although it is a rinds got good illiteration to it

[02:13:45.100 --> 02:13:49.680]
Said an unemotional Delacruz in military corpsmen camped in North of San Diego

[02:13:50.580 --> 02:13:56.740]
Delacruz also said he watched squad leader Sargent Frank Woodridge shoot five men who I'm not sure we can really say that

[02:13:56.740 --> 02:13:59.200]
Colleague Joyce see if we can say that it sounds like a body part

[02:13:59.200 --> 02:14:00.440]
It sounds like uterus

[02:14:01.240 --> 02:14:04.320]
Sargent Frank Woodridge shoot five men whose hands were tied up near a car

[02:14:04.700 --> 02:14:07.140]
Delacruz also said he shot the five men as they laid on the ground

[02:14:07.140 --> 02:14:11.460]
You know I want to try this again because I think you're overreacting here

[02:14:11.460 --> 02:14:12.040]
Okay I might be

[02:14:13.920 --> 02:14:16.160]
Warwick walked to me and told me that if anybody asked

[02:14:17.660 --> 02:14:20.940]
They were running away in the Iraqi army shot them Delacruz testified

[02:14:21.460 --> 02:14:24.220]
Three Marines have been charged with murder for offices have been charged with their listen of duty

[02:14:24.220 --> 02:14:25.740]
And I'm structing the investigation

[02:14:25.740 --> 02:14:27.760]
Watching mom and dad

[02:14:27.760 --> 02:14:31.260]
Beeping through the keyhole the most we ever had

[02:14:31.260 --> 02:14:34.560]
Now I think it will take like one illiterate of time

[02:14:34.560 --> 02:14:36.460]
Or maybe one syllable

[02:14:38.100 --> 02:14:39.780]
Yeah, well mom is not a sad

[02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:43.360]
1113 on the pull-up by the way we got

[02:14:43.760 --> 02:14:45.660]
52 minutes to get another 87 both

[02:14:45.660 --> 02:14:47.660]
That's less than two a minute Chris you can do it

[02:14:48.060 --> 02:14:51.240]
Come on get your magic wand out

[02:14:51.240 --> 02:14:52.700]
Told you it's not pretty weird

[02:14:52.700 --> 02:14:54.560]
And got a plane tag

[02:14:55.260 --> 02:14:57.000]
Now what's wrong with that? I think so far

[02:14:57.000 --> 02:14:58.480]
Okay, I think what we can do

[02:14:58.940 --> 02:15:02.080]
Maybe I just came up with a solution for all the problems of the Joyce created problems

[02:15:02.840 --> 02:15:08.680]
Is we can take bits and pieces of like playing bagpipes and the sofa king and then and all the stuff we can play

[02:15:08.680 --> 02:15:12.220]
They 80% of the material we got on the DCS and like piece them all together

[02:15:12.940 --> 02:15:14.780]
And just play the parts that we can play

[02:15:16.020 --> 02:15:20.660]
Okay, it's not going to be funny 20 minute show using what it'll be a 20 minute show

[02:15:20.660 --> 02:15:23.780]
Right there on the bed

[02:15:24.480 --> 02:15:24.880]
Bed

[02:15:28.200 --> 02:15:31.220]
Oh my god, he sure got a good head on his shoulders

[02:15:31.220 --> 02:15:33.020]
Oh, so speak of that message

[02:15:33.700 --> 02:15:35.020]
Now I don't want to go into it

[02:15:35.020 --> 02:15:36.980]
You talk about it sometime if you're in the mood

[02:15:37.440 --> 02:15:39.220]
Right, you should have talked about it

[02:15:39.220 --> 02:15:41.500]
You're not did you go to lunch with this person yesterday holding

[02:15:41.500 --> 02:15:43.660]
This person was here in the building

[02:15:44.300 --> 02:15:48.720]
And you looked at him with a straight face and didn't feel like I can look at people with

[02:15:50.440 --> 02:15:51.340]
Well, there you go

[02:15:51.340 --> 02:15:54.420]
Another one with mommy using your boobies like maybe it's like a door stop

[02:15:56.160 --> 02:15:57.460]
1113 click that baby

[02:15:57.460 --> 02:16:01.760]
Let's see if we're gonna actually make 1200 that that would put me into a real good frame of mind for the weekend

[02:16:01.760 --> 02:16:05.600]
Although it's still 1113 especially for that early Saturday morning woodbind session

[02:16:05.600 --> 02:16:08.580]
I have every week it's still stuff there 1113 we're not going to get no 12

[02:16:08.580 --> 02:16:10.680]
Why couldn't you just settle for 11 Chris?

[02:16:11.440 --> 02:16:15.620]
You crazy person or what? I think I've been a bad influence on you see we always

[02:16:16.380 --> 02:16:17.980]
Set the target way too high

[02:16:18.880 --> 02:16:22.880]
So Friday afternoon is the middle of May for Christ's sake what what are you thinking about?

[02:16:23.460 --> 02:16:28.800]
Gonna get another hundred votes on here in an hour yeah on a Friday on what used to be back in the day

[02:16:28.800 --> 02:16:32.700]
Back when we had the audience back when his station was like viable and living and breathing

[02:16:32.700 --> 02:16:37.260]
Before this new regime came in and just butchered it and ripped it to bloody little pieces

[02:16:38.100 --> 02:16:39.620]
Back in the day we did it easily

[02:16:40.160 --> 02:16:44.380]
Concerns focused on US interest that there's a US military facilities in that country

[02:16:44.380 --> 02:16:47.760]
And Jim what kind of efforts have been going on there in Germany to fight on the fight on the military?

[02:16:47.760 --> 02:16:50.260]
I see on my screen, I'm sure I'm trying to be taken out

[02:16:50.260 --> 02:16:57.920]
I think you know what's up again about a possible terrorism on US interest in Germany better not be in Berlin because each being on Berlin or baby

[02:16:57.920 --> 02:17:02.560]
They better leave my friends in Berlin alone respond in particular I can think of don't be messing with him

[02:17:03.580 --> 02:17:05.020]
Because I want to be messing with him

[02:17:05.580 --> 02:17:08.540]
Now how come I don't get the text message from him?

[02:17:09.040 --> 02:17:09.920]
Because you want them

[02:17:10.740 --> 02:17:16.100]
1118 we got nice chunk in there I think you can do a Chris you got 50 minutes and you need 82 votes

[02:17:16.100 --> 02:17:19.240]
The ratio is still doable it's a doable deed you know

[02:17:19.240 --> 02:17:23.820]
Yes just like in Berlin when I found out it was a doable deed you know I did I do it

[02:17:26.180 --> 02:17:29.900]
Sometimes you have wishes and sometimes they're unduable and you know

[02:17:29.900 --> 02:17:34.100]
Yeah you can do it and it turns out to be doable and you do it

[02:17:34.100 --> 02:17:37.600]
If it's good and it's doable do it that's my philosophy in life

[02:17:39.680 --> 02:17:44.920]
If it's looking for your money and for to get into your will and you know sucking around

[02:17:44.920 --> 02:17:46.780]
Where there's a will there's a gate

[02:17:47.700 --> 02:17:52.700]

Who's a real peace of terms is married to Maria Schreiber with no chin and you wonder why America's got problems

[02:18:21.320 --> 02:18:26.400]
You wonder why Bush is in there with a bunch of Nazis destroying the country I bet your Arnold's got something to do with it

Who's gonna get breaking up low

[02:18:35.440 --> 02:18:37.840]
Ricky Williams say goodbye

[02:18:39.100 --> 02:18:41.100]
You're for all

[02:18:41.100 --> 02:18:47.440]
Oh Ricky how can you do this I want to stroke your legs

[02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:51.440]
And slip your crack with my greasy nose

[02:18:51.980 --> 02:18:57.680]
But you rather slow this cliff now I'm pulling up my thigh

[02:18:57.680 --> 02:18:59.900]
For the season

[02:19:00.900 --> 02:19:06.900]
You dashed my hopes of memory bliss here's well open my eyes

[02:19:07.580 --> 02:19:13.840]
Oh no what parent reason I'm like bus of the dude

[02:19:13.840 --> 02:19:23.920]
There's no AC in my trailer and then I find you no longer here

[02:19:24.820 --> 02:19:33.420]
You'd have a day like my bus of failure and over the hearts of all those forced wheeze

[02:19:33.420 --> 02:19:39.200]
Oh no what a fit it's nice now you're the real John

[02:19:39.200 --> 02:19:45.400]
It's your toes I've walked in my mouth on the path of the skies

[02:19:45.400 --> 02:19:48.760]
I've used to have to write some old radio

[02:19:50.420 --> 02:19:53.140]
Who leads us like this

[02:19:54.480 --> 02:19:57.880]
And only shacks comes we can feel

[02:19:58.780 --> 02:20:00.080]
Oh speaking of

[02:20:00.080 --> 02:20:03.280]
Gully is on for a mad dog today to deform this warning ahead of time

[02:20:03.280 --> 02:20:04.220]
Don't say we didn't warn you

[02:20:05.280 --> 02:20:08.660]
1135 and a poll we need 65 more votes in 43 minutes

[02:20:08.660 --> 02:20:11.100]
And I bet you Chris is working feverishly right now behind the scenes

[02:20:11.100 --> 02:20:13.680]
To make sure he can put that together for us isn't he?

[02:20:13.680 --> 02:20:18.680]
Huh right so what are you thinking you think and positively you don't want to go in a weekend

[02:20:18.680 --> 02:20:23.700]
Fallen short that's bad we got it really bad especially after Barry Jack has

[02:20:23.700 --> 02:20:28.500]
Wrote that we're dying over here and we're old and we got so much older between December when we kicked

[02:20:28.500 --> 02:20:33.080]
As we were number one and January when we had that bogus month and the hit of bogus month across the street

[02:20:33.080 --> 02:20:35.540]
Of course we had older yeah but he got older man

[02:20:36.660 --> 02:20:40.440]
Well he needs some younger people maybe that Evan Cohen ought to be on there

[02:20:40.440 --> 02:20:45.300]
Maybe we ought to get some a 10 year old kid from DeMoy who's got a great arm and they like that

[02:20:45.300 --> 02:20:50.420]
Stupid stupid stupid stupid and he even wrote it in the middle of the zone article and he just

[02:20:50.420 --> 02:20:56.620]
To stupid to realize it and after the reason people were listening to the last year was because of the comedy bits and the humor and the stuff

[02:20:56.620 --> 02:20:58.740]
Not because they're talking about ball games okay

[02:21:00.200 --> 02:21:06.220]
People who talk about ball games and take it seriously need very very serious assistance you know I'm saying

[02:21:07.160 --> 02:21:13.000]
And then there's some things people don't want to hear about on your hockey I mean I'm a big hockey fan I watch the game last night

[02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:20.720]
Unfortunately Buffalo just totally what were they doing what were they doing the sabers coughing it up handing it away breakaway after breakaway

[02:21:20.720 --> 02:21:25.160]
The center just kicked their ass made me very depressed but nevertheless I watched it there's no interest

[02:21:25.160 --> 02:21:31.220]
So I don't talk about it you notice that I finally wised up I mean you know Burmese 500 times you're not going to Burmese 501

[02:21:33.060 --> 02:21:38.540]
Horse racing people know that there is no interest none the none zero

[02:21:39.360 --> 02:21:44.680]
There's a you know like 50 old talkers who hang out of the rail down there at colder and a Gulf Stream and that's about it

[02:21:44.680 --> 02:21:47.220]
Lester Greenshire at that crowd that's it I

[02:21:50.380 --> 02:21:57.420]
Rowan bag I mean speaks for itself you're gonna be pleased with this story though all right you're gonna be very you're gonna be happy camper

[02:21:58.160 --> 02:22:03.500]
Walmart stores ink posted its worst monthly same store sales results in at least 28 years

[02:22:04.840 --> 02:22:11.420]
Calying a 3.5% decline in April to this year's early Easter as well as generally challenging economic conditions for consumers

[02:22:12.680 --> 02:22:20.100]
Walmart's 3.5% drop in the four-week period ending May 4 at US stores fell below its earlier forecast of flat sales to a 2% decline

[02:22:20.580 --> 02:22:28.860]
In a recorded full message yesterday Walmart blamed bad weather last month in most US regions in the early Easter on April 8 which pushed many Easter sales into March

[02:22:29.340 --> 02:22:33.000]
Same store sales major sales gains the losses its stores open for least a year

[02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:36.320]
There were key indicator of the returns a retailer reefs on the capital it spends

[02:22:36.320 --> 02:22:41.400]
Reef what you sow is not gonna say that in the good book you shall re-put you sow or sow

[02:22:41.400 --> 02:22:45.980]
I think it's so so say that in there it says Walmart is so so something like that or so and so

[02:22:46.920 --> 02:22:50.100]
1141 let's see if we can't do this thing up and get it start and get close

[02:22:50.700 --> 02:22:58.100]
So that hopes rings eternal now the nice chunk therefore it's just a 46 and that's without even taking eight calls here for quite a while

[02:22:58.980 --> 02:23:06.440]
And I'm gonna tell you this right now Joe Bell comes in where new you and says something about taking calls on the show and one I'm on you can take all the calls you want you can be a

[02:23:06.440 --> 02:23:12.000]
Massacres you can wind up in a loonie bin like Renfell I will huh I'm halfway there already so yeah

[02:23:13.700 --> 02:23:19.520]
But if he ever says anything like that just looking at just you know I'm gonna tell you right now where you should say to him okay

[02:23:19.520 --> 02:23:23.100]
All right, that's right just looking right in the on go

[02:23:24.460 --> 02:23:33.540]
Hey Joe yeah what do you know I mean anybody that's talking seriously about putting tapes best of tapes on the air I mean one day a week

[02:23:33.540 --> 02:23:38.960]
This has to be a crazy person. Well, you know we've only substitute Neil Rogers so much before it's not the Neil Rogers show anymore

[02:23:38.960 --> 02:23:39.760]
Right

[02:23:41.880 --> 02:23:52.080]
Cindy sheen is a very sad column. Do I have time to read it? I'll make time no more I know she writes more needless carnage isn't on this working chip more needless carnage by Cindy sheen

[02:23:53.480 --> 02:23:57.980]
She says I had difficulty making the purchase of George ten its new book with a multi-million dollar advance already

[02:23:57.980 --> 02:24:02.120]
I didn't want to contribute to someone who's already profited so obscenely from other people's dead children

[02:24:02.120 --> 02:24:10.740]
The self-congratulatory book passing book was even more difficult to read but when I came to the last paragraph and read the above quote about tenants precious son John Michael

[02:24:10.740 --> 02:24:18.520]
I began to cry in my uncomfortable airplane seat the quote was my son John Michael is the best son of dad can have he'll always be my pride and joy

[02:24:19.060 --> 02:24:20.920]
In his book at the center of the storm

[02:24:21.720 --> 02:24:27.000]
Cindy sheen says I believe that Casey was the best son of mom and dad could have he was our first our immense pride and joy

[02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:34.400]
Casey served as church and one capacity rather from the time he was eight years old for the day he died at Palm Sunday Mass he attended the morning of his murder in an ambush

[02:24:34.400 --> 02:24:46.980]
He was an eagle scout an honest student a trusted friend a loving big brother and the best son of mom could have the above paragraph reads like an obituary because Casey is dead in part because of tenant support of a president for whom he has great affection

[02:24:47.760 --> 02:24:58.600]
Condi we have a problem tenant firstly begins the chapter on the sixteen words the sentence that justified in illegal war of aggression was the British government has learned that son of Hussein recently sought significant quantities of eraning from Africa

[02:24:59.120 --> 02:25:09.600]
The CIA was successful in making the White House take these words out of a birth speech October 2002 but when the words that everyone knew were lies were included in the 2003 state of the Union speech shortly before shock and awe

[02:25:09.600 --> 02:25:21.300]
Tenet did not publicly stand up do the right thing and refute the claim as a matter of fact knowing all the facts were false and or skewed he sat behind Colin Powell when the then secretary state lied to the UN thereby giving the false statements more credibility

[02:25:22.240 --> 02:25:29.480]
George tenant also praises George Bush for taking so much time with his son John Michael to help him through the rough times that can come being the son of a DCI

[02:25:29.480 --> 02:25:33.240]
George B should know since he was the son of another dishonest DCI

[02:25:33.920 --> 02:25:47.180]
George teen with his brain and heart that the invasion of Iraq was wrongly justified but he allowed this country to rush headlong and the inevitable disaster by his silence in slam dunk cheerleading he's complicit in the death of almost 3,400 best sons and daughters of other moms and dads

[02:25:47.180 --> 02:26:01.940]
How can tenant looking the eyes of John Michael and not see their extinguished heart lights of hundreds of thousands of Iraqi humans how can he and the killer neocons live with their own selves and sleep in that well night without being hunted by the souls of these that their crimes have needlessly killed why is John Michael not in boot camp

[02:26:02.740 --> 02:26:09.400]
Intense confession of incompetence and conniving he also called George Bush's chief of staff and group card the most honorable man he's ever known

[02:26:09.400 --> 02:26:23.420]
This is the same Andy card who formed and led the White House Iraq group which was an internal working group whose task was to sell the invasor of Iraq to a global American public and include other honorable people such as scooter livy carrying hues, kandy, steven-hatley and bushes brain-car robe

[02:26:23.420 --> 02:26:32.500]
This group leaked false intelligence news to such friendly before this is due to Miller formerly of the New York Times who came up with such deliberately misleading terms as smoking gun and mushroom cloud

[02:26:33.500 --> 02:26:42.700]
In a much publicized letter my friend Raymond governor of the retired CIA intelligence analyst called for tenants return his presidential medal or freedom which he unacquivatively refuses to do in any interview I've seen him give recently

[02:26:42.700 --> 02:26:51.820]
I agree with George to he earned his medal by silence and his court recipients that year Jerry Bremmer and General Tommy Frank's retired also earned their medals for their callous incompetence

[02:26:51.820 --> 02:27:09.660]
The three did the jobs the president set out for them to do the presidential medal of freedom has about as much validity is our corrupt elections the corrupt 9-11 commission the corrupt congress the corrupt corporate media in our own constitution has been thoroughly corrupted disobeyed ignored and trampled on by everyone in the Bush regime and most congress folks who complacently go along with us of dutch and American republic

[02:27:10.080 --> 02:27:18.560]
Let George ten to keep his little metal he knows why he received it it was payment for rolling over like an abused dog that submissibly offers his belly and licks the hand of the master who beats him

[02:27:19.440 --> 02:27:32.740]
For all these honorable people their lies their average their cruelty and yes their treasonous premeditated war my son and hundreds of thousands of others are dead or mentally or physically wounded a country's being destroyed on a daily basis and bush co is still roaming free to commit their high crimes against humanity

[02:27:33.500 --> 02:27:40.800]
sitting president survives presidents can't legally be sued for what they do in office but as far as I know there's no such prohibition against suing the disgrace dc i

[02:27:41.340 --> 02:27:52.280]
is there a lawyer out there in cyberland who wants to represent families in a wrongful death injury class action suit against George tenet contact me please she says can't case him on at yahu dot com stories on our website by syndesian

[02:27:53.280 --> 02:27:55.060]
two days before mother's day

[02:27:55.060 --> 02:27:57.040]
there you are still

[02:27:57.040 --> 02:27:57.480]

back in the day when someone done a strong

[02:28:07.060 --> 02:28:10.020]
we didn't take their crap

[02:28:10.020 --> 02:28:13.900]
in girl harbour or when the jabs dropped their bombs

[02:28:13.900 --> 02:28:20.240]
bar we found them back and other soddies they hit us high

[02:28:20.240 --> 02:28:23.440]
and on our cards our little flags wave

[02:28:23.440 --> 02:28:28.220]
has that's on you love it recharged voice of our

[02:28:28.220 --> 02:28:30.440]
the wrong way

[02:28:33.460 --> 02:28:34.460]
and

[02:28:34.460 --> 02:28:38.820]
of embarrassed to be in America where they follow

[02:28:38.820 --> 02:28:40.560]

the United States of

[02:28:43.260 --> 02:28:43.920]
America

[02:28:43.920 --> 02:28:46.500]
the white bush and family

[02:28:46.500 --> 02:28:48.420]
they got this country

[02:28:49.780 --> 02:28:51.260]
and the late door

[02:28:51.260 --> 02:28:53.860]
the darkest days in our history

[02:28:55.260 --> 02:28:57.300]
I don't want to be a packs of

[02:28:57.300 --> 02:28:58.060]
America

[02:28:59.640 --> 02:29:00.600]
in the

[02:29:01.580 --> 02:29:02.340]
USA

what's a few thousand innocent lives

[02:29:11.380 --> 02:29:13.760]
stop living in the past

[02:29:14.380 --> 02:29:18.240]
if you want that SUV to drive

[02:29:18.240 --> 02:29:20.820]
you're gonna need more gas

[02:29:21.380 --> 02:29:25.180]
it's the greatest country in the world

[02:29:25.180 --> 02:29:27.340]
they train us to believe

[02:29:27.340 --> 02:29:30.360]
and anyone who says that

[02:29:30.360 --> 02:29:31.500]
obviously

[02:29:32.380 --> 02:29:35.480]
and the four to the

[02:29:37.660 --> 02:29:40.480]
and of embarrassed to be

[02:29:48.720 --> 02:29:51.100]

about that

[02:30:51.780 --> 02:30:52.420]
text message

[02:30:52.420 --> 02:30:53.300]
what's the first day

[02:30:53.800 --> 02:30:55.340]
eleven fifty six the first day is

[02:30:55.340 --> 02:30:56.860]
I think my next vacation is like

[02:30:56.860 --> 02:30:58.460]
June 15 something like that

[02:30:58.460 --> 02:30:59.000]
look on the counter

[02:30:59.000 --> 02:30:59.800]
and look at what they

[02:30:59.800 --> 02:31:00.220]
is Friday

[02:31:01.560 --> 02:31:02.740]
I got it written down here

[02:31:03.500 --> 02:31:04.140]
June 15th

[02:31:04.140 --> 02:31:04.560]
Friday

[02:31:05.160 --> 02:31:06.880]
I will not be there on the 15th

[02:31:07.660 --> 02:31:09.240]
which means that's the day you're going to be

[02:31:09.240 --> 02:31:10.860]
well if I were you I wouldn't be

[02:31:10.860 --> 02:31:11.820]
blurtin out too much

[02:31:11.820 --> 02:31:13.540]
I can say anything

[02:31:14.840 --> 02:31:16.080]
I'm just telling you for your own

[02:31:16.080 --> 02:31:16.380]
you know

[02:31:16.380 --> 02:31:20.320]
yeah look I don't care anyway

[02:31:20.320 --> 02:31:21.160]
I ain't none of my business

[02:31:22.240 --> 02:31:23.700]
you care no I don't

[02:31:23.700 --> 02:31:24.340]
I have about that

[02:31:24.340 --> 02:31:25.180]
yes you do you care

[02:31:25.180 --> 02:31:26.020]
it's funny I care about that

[02:31:26.020 --> 02:31:27.260]
it's not going to be a very hysterical

[02:31:27.260 --> 02:31:28.320]
and it is going to be a very

[02:31:28.320 --> 02:31:28.320]

[02:31:28.320 --> 02:31:29.340]
until as far as I care

[02:31:29.340 --> 02:31:30.680]
because people people would be

[02:31:30.680 --> 02:31:31.500]
driving off the road

[02:31:31.500 --> 02:31:32.240]
they'd be driving into

[02:31:33.260 --> 02:31:34.240]
cricks and cricks

[02:31:34.240 --> 02:31:35.220]
and swimming holes

[02:31:35.220 --> 02:31:35.920]
like that guy I'm for

[02:31:35.920 --> 02:31:36.320]
a lot of day

[02:31:36.320 --> 02:31:37.660]
getting cricks in their necks

[02:31:37.660 --> 02:31:38.580]
yeah they would

[02:31:38.580 --> 02:31:39.940]
I think I'd get a crick in my neck

[02:31:39.940 --> 02:31:40.660]
just to that ever

[02:31:40.660 --> 02:31:41.440]
and half

[02:31:41.900 --> 02:31:43.080]
oh the thought of that

[02:31:43.080 --> 02:31:43.600]
is just so

[02:31:43.600 --> 02:31:46.260]
I mean I'm I'm walkin' to lunch

[02:31:46.260 --> 02:31:47.060]
and I'm reading in fact

[02:31:47.060 --> 02:31:48.340]
I was walkin' on the way to the

[02:31:48.340 --> 02:31:50.400]
kinkos to mail that FedEx

[02:31:50.400 --> 02:31:51.240]
to you right

[02:31:51.240 --> 02:31:52.240]
which you did get by the way

[02:31:52.240 --> 02:31:53.260]
and you're sending out the good stuff

[02:31:53.260 --> 02:31:54.400]
for my close personal friend

[02:31:54.400 --> 02:31:55.160]
oh well I'll send it Monday

[02:31:55.160 --> 02:31:56.240]
I forgot to bring in the original

[02:31:56.240 --> 02:31:57.440]
actually I brought in the copies

[02:31:59.100 --> 02:32:00.360]
I misunderstood the project

[02:32:00.360 --> 02:32:00.680]
so

[02:32:02.580 --> 02:32:03.900]
well what what differences make

[02:32:03.900 --> 02:32:04.920]
which one you send out?

[02:32:05.080 --> 02:32:05.460]
I guess not

[02:32:06.720 --> 02:32:07.560]
when in doubt

[02:32:07.560 --> 02:32:08.420]
send it out

[02:32:08.420 --> 02:32:09.440]
I don't want to start playing

[02:32:09.440 --> 02:32:10.180]
which boss here

[02:32:10.180 --> 02:32:10.940]
because I never do that

[02:32:10.940 --> 02:32:11.920]
but in this particular case

[02:32:11.920 --> 02:32:13.320]
but it involves you know

[02:32:14.420 --> 02:32:15.580]
I mean it's not like

[02:32:15.580 --> 02:32:16.960]
an emergency like it's going to

[02:32:16.960 --> 02:32:17.460]
but it's not

[02:32:17.460 --> 02:32:18.420]
no no it's all I might not

[02:32:18.420 --> 02:32:19.520]
have a padded envelope this

[02:32:19.520 --> 02:32:20.360]
but I'll look around

[02:32:20.360 --> 02:32:22.100]
you know the choice is yours

[02:32:22.100 --> 02:32:23.580]
padded envelope or padded

[02:32:23.580 --> 02:32:24.580]
self take your choice

[02:32:24.580 --> 02:32:26.380]
still up in 57 criss you need

[02:32:26.380 --> 02:32:27.880]
43 votes in 26 minutes

[02:32:27.880 --> 02:32:28.980]
that's not to a minute

[02:32:28.980 --> 02:32:30.040]
but boy it's sure not

[02:32:30.040 --> 02:32:31.260]
not not much happening there

[02:32:31.260 --> 02:32:32.240]
unless you get a chunk or two

[02:32:32.240 --> 02:32:33.460]
we need some chunks

[02:32:33.460 --> 02:32:34.880]
on our pool here

[02:32:36.860 --> 02:32:37.860]
and it's a

[02:32:37.860 --> 02:32:38.520]
see the reason

[02:32:38.520 --> 02:32:39.040]
that we're not getting

[02:32:39.460 --> 02:32:40.740]
humongous is because it's a one

[02:32:40.740 --> 02:32:42.280]
when you got 65% almost

[02:32:42.280 --> 02:32:43.280]
with one answer

[02:32:43.280 --> 02:32:44.500]
it's not like there's some

[02:32:44.500 --> 02:32:45.420]
controversy or something

[02:32:45.420 --> 02:32:46.500]
there's no controversy

[02:32:46.500 --> 02:32:47.600]
the internet is where they

[02:32:47.600 --> 02:32:48.460]
get most of their porn

[02:32:48.460 --> 02:32:49.620]
most of the audience

[02:32:50.080 --> 02:32:51.180]
shame on them not

[02:32:51.920 --> 02:32:53.260]
I just want to know the websites

[02:32:55.040 --> 02:32:55.880]
1157 we still

[02:32:55.880 --> 02:32:56.840]
it's just not changing

[02:32:56.840 --> 02:32:57.880]
you're dead meat man

[02:32:57.880 --> 02:32:58.720]
I'm just telling you right now

[02:32:58.720 --> 02:32:59.960]
I did meat not going to have

[02:32:59.960 --> 02:33:00.460]
okay

[02:33:01.200 --> 02:33:02.120]
what do you think

[02:33:02.120 --> 02:33:03.560]
we'll do it

[02:33:05.200 --> 02:33:06.380]
not looking too promising

[02:33:06.380 --> 02:33:07.080]
man when we

[02:33:07.080 --> 02:33:08.500]
although this is always the time

[02:33:08.500 --> 02:33:09.700]
it's like about 35 after

[02:33:09.700 --> 02:33:10.560]
the hour I think this is when

[02:33:11.080 --> 02:33:12.480]
when Eric steps on the break

[02:33:12.480 --> 02:33:13.600]
up there in Orlando

[02:33:14.520 --> 02:33:15.800]
he slams on the break

[02:33:15.800 --> 02:33:17.140]
and he puts his finger

[02:33:17.140 --> 02:33:18.200]
on the big button

[02:33:18.200 --> 02:33:19.360]
or he puts his thumb on it

[02:33:19.360 --> 02:33:20.720]
and we got another one

[02:33:20.720 --> 02:33:21.300]
1158

[02:33:24.660 --> 02:33:26.120]
wow so anyway I'm sitting there

[02:33:26.120 --> 02:33:27.240]
at woodbind at my machine

[02:33:27.240 --> 02:33:28.620]
in the blackberry buzzes

[02:33:28.620 --> 02:33:28.700]
and I'm going to

[02:33:28.700 --> 02:33:29.300]
not capberry

[02:33:29.920 --> 02:33:30.860]
not I don't want to go

[02:33:30.860 --> 02:33:31.800]
into it

[02:33:31.800 --> 02:33:32.820]
you have to admit it

[02:33:32.820 --> 02:33:34.040]
just I mean when I told you

[02:33:34.040 --> 02:33:35.000]
what I tell you yesterday

[02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:35.880]
morning that they before

[02:33:35.880 --> 02:33:36.140]
yeah

[02:33:36.660 --> 02:33:37.380]
whatever morning

[02:33:37.380 --> 02:33:38.620]
yes in between telling everybody

[02:33:38.620 --> 02:33:39.520]
else that I knew in the world

[02:33:40.400 --> 02:33:41.840]
and it just was one of the most

[02:33:41.840 --> 02:33:42.960]
bizarre experiences of my

[02:33:42.960 --> 02:33:43.820]
lifetime I can't tell you

[02:33:43.820 --> 02:33:44.340]
though what it was

[02:33:44.340 --> 02:33:45.960]
but use your imagination

[02:33:47.700 --> 02:33:48.740]
who writes this

[02:33:48.740 --> 02:33:49.480]
Kevin White Law

[02:33:49.480 --> 02:33:50.300]
he resurgents men

[02:33:50.300 --> 02:33:51.220]
as US spy agency

[02:33:51.220 --> 02:33:52.200]
say I'll cut his stuff

[02:33:52.200 --> 02:33:53.000]
leave his wants on the

[02:33:53.000 --> 02:33:53.540]
one of regroup

[02:33:53.540 --> 02:33:54.480]
heck of a job there

[02:33:54.480 --> 02:33:55.760]
brownie in the WNL

[02:33:55.760 --> 02:33:56.800]
you are fascist

[02:33:57.380 --> 02:33:58.100]
when president

[02:33:58.100 --> 02:33:58.780]
Bush talks about

[02:33:58.780 --> 02:33:59.420]
or some of the law

[02:33:59.420 --> 02:34:00.300]
these days it's usually

[02:34:00.300 --> 02:34:01.180]
the rally support for the

[02:34:01.180 --> 02:34:01.980]
US effort in Iraq

[02:34:01.980 --> 02:34:03.220]
last month he told an

[02:34:03.220 --> 02:34:03.800]
audience that been

[02:34:03.800 --> 02:34:04.260]
lawman in his

[02:34:04.260 --> 02:34:04.840]
al-Qaeda network

[02:34:04.840 --> 02:34:06.020]
have made it clear they

[02:34:06.020 --> 02:34:06.760]
want to drive us from

[02:34:06.760 --> 02:34:07.340]
Iraq to establish

[02:34:07.340 --> 02:34:08.160]
safe haven in order to

[02:34:08.160 --> 02:34:09.080]
launch further attacks

[02:34:09.080 --> 02:34:10.540]
but over the past year

[02:34:10.540 --> 02:34:11.720]
US intelligence agencies

[02:34:11.720 --> 02:34:12.720]
have completely revised

[02:34:12.720 --> 02:34:14.020]
their assessment of

[02:34:14.020 --> 02:34:15.160]
al-Qaeda and reached an

[02:34:15.160 --> 02:34:16.300]
alarming conclusion

[02:34:16.300 --> 02:34:17.400]
been lawman already

[02:34:17.400 --> 02:34:18.440]
has a safe haven in

[02:34:18.440 --> 02:34:19.600]
Pakistan and may be

[02:34:19.600 --> 02:34:20.620]
stronger than ever

[02:34:20.620 --> 02:34:21.760]
in Pakistan

[02:34:22.480 --> 02:34:23.500]
the shift is dramatic

[02:34:23.500 --> 02:34:24.100]
two years ago

[02:34:24.100 --> 02:34:24.540]
when the head of the

[02:34:24.540 --> 02:34:25.100]
defense intelligence

[02:34:25.100 --> 02:34:26.160]
agency vice-admiral

[02:34:26.160 --> 02:34:27.320]
Lowell Jacobi went to

[02:34:27.320 --> 02:34:28.240]
Capitol Hill to

[02:34:28.240 --> 02:34:28.840]
deliver his annual

[02:34:28.840 --> 02:34:29.900]
threat assessment he

[02:34:29.900 --> 02:34:30.840]
described al-Qaeda

[02:34:30.840 --> 02:34:31.740]
leaders as battered and

[02:34:31.740 --> 02:34:32.100]
isolated.

[02:34:32.600 --> 02:34:33.680]
Osama bin Laden in his

[02:34:33.680 --> 02:34:34.420]
senior leadership no

[02:34:34.420 --> 02:34:35.880]
longer exercise centralized

[02:34:35.880 --> 02:34:36.640]
control and direction

[02:34:36.640 --> 02:34:37.320]
control congress.

[02:34:37.640 --> 02:34:38.140]
The more serious

[02:34:38.140 --> 02:34:38.900]
strategy ended was a

[02:34:38.900 --> 02:34:39.640]
burgeoning network of

[02:34:39.640 --> 02:34:40.480]
individual extremists

[02:34:40.480 --> 02:34:41.420]
entrepreneurial cells

[02:34:41.420 --> 02:34:42.720]
inspired by bin Laden.

[02:34:43.220 --> 02:34:43.580]
That judgment

[02:34:43.580 --> 02:34:44.800]
essentially remained on

[02:34:44.800 --> 02:34:45.880]
changed through 2006.

[02:34:46.740 --> 02:34:47.640]
When the courthead of the

[02:34:47.640 --> 02:34:48.820]
DIA, Lieutenant General

[02:34:48.820 --> 02:34:49.880]
Michael Maples visited

[02:34:49.880 --> 02:34:51.240]
Capitol Hill this year he

[02:34:51.240 --> 02:34:51.880]
warned that the group

[02:34:51.880 --> 02:34:52.920]
leaders are residing in

[02:34:52.920 --> 02:34:54.020]
actively plotting from

[02:34:54.020 --> 02:34:54.720]
their new base in

[02:34:54.720 --> 02:34:55.340]
Pakistan.

[02:34:55.920 --> 02:34:56.920]
Al-Qaeda retains the

[02:34:56.920 --> 02:34:57.640]
ability to organize

[02:34:57.640 --> 02:34:59.160]
complex mass-casuality

[02:34:59.160 --> 02:34:59.940]
attacks and

[02:34:59.940 --> 02:35:00.880]
inspire others Maples

[02:35:00.880 --> 02:35:02.000]
said al-Qaeda has

[02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:03.100]
consistently recovered

[02:35:03.100 --> 02:35:04.300]
from losses of senior

[02:35:04.300 --> 02:35:04.780]
leadership.

[02:35:05.740 --> 02:35:06.660]
And it goes on.

[02:35:06.760 --> 02:35:08.100]
It's alongside research

[02:35:08.100 --> 02:35:09.680]
and minutes by Kevin White

[02:35:09.680 --> 02:35:09.880]
Law.

[02:35:11.160 --> 02:35:12.220]
But we're worried about

[02:35:12.220 --> 02:35:13.480]
Bubba and a blue dress

[02:35:13.480 --> 02:35:14.380]
baby and at the

[02:35:14.380 --> 02:35:15.580]
stain that seem in the

[02:35:15.580 --> 02:35:16.780]
stain on the blue dress.

[02:35:17.060 --> 02:35:18.580]
That's the bad stuff.

[02:35:18.860 --> 02:35:19.540]
You allow to say that.

[02:35:20.340 --> 02:35:20.540]
What?

[02:35:20.900 --> 02:35:21.120]
Seaman?

[02:35:21.180 --> 02:35:23.700]
Are you going to start

[02:35:23.700 --> 02:35:24.300]
up with me again?

[02:35:24.340 --> 02:35:24.700]
Because you've

[02:35:24.700 --> 02:35:24.700]

[02:35:24.700 --> 02:35:25.180]
been watching.

[02:35:25.480 --> 02:35:26.140]
Where is that thing?

[02:35:26.340 --> 02:35:26.560]
Or what?

[02:35:27.540 --> 02:35:28.760]
I'm just trying to find

[02:35:28.760 --> 02:35:29.120]
that traffic.

[02:35:29.620 --> 02:35:30.060]
Oh, there it is.

[02:35:30.080 --> 02:35:30.960]
Hey, Bella!

[02:35:31.220 --> 02:35:31.480]
That one.

[02:35:32.900 --> 02:35:33.600]
Scared the hell out of

[02:35:33.600 --> 02:35:33.860]
myself.

[02:35:35.040 --> 02:35:35.840]
1170 on here.

[02:35:35.880 --> 02:35:36.480]
What do you think we

[02:35:36.480 --> 02:35:36.600]
need?

[02:35:36.720 --> 02:35:37.760]
Do we have 23 minutes for

[02:35:37.760 --> 02:35:38.460]
30 votes?

[02:35:38.660 --> 02:35:39.940]
That's not even close to

[02:35:39.940 --> 02:35:40.320]
a minute.

[02:35:41.200 --> 02:35:42.180]
Chris is pretty confident.

[02:35:42.600 --> 02:35:43.280]
And of course, he's

[02:35:43.280 --> 02:35:43.860]
not interested in saying,

[02:35:44.100 --> 02:35:45.220]
why do you keep wasting your

[02:35:45.220 --> 02:35:45.700]
time with us?

[02:35:45.760 --> 02:35:46.540]
Because of that.

[02:35:46.940 --> 02:35:47.640]
Because of that.

[02:35:48.280 --> 02:35:48.880]
1170 won't.

[02:35:48.920 --> 02:35:49.340]
They're right?

[02:35:49.800 --> 02:35:50.120]
No.

[02:35:50.380 --> 02:35:51.480]
You can do it!

[02:35:51.800 --> 02:35:52.560]
Yeah, because it's

[02:35:52.560 --> 02:35:53.340]
something to do with it.

[02:35:53.340 --> 02:35:53.580]
You're going to have a

[02:35:53.580 --> 02:35:53.940]
goal, baby.

[02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:54.440]
It's not going to

[02:35:54.440 --> 02:35:54.980]
hockey game.

[02:35:55.000 --> 02:35:55.760]
You shoot for the goal,

[02:35:55.760 --> 02:35:56.820]
goal, or like in a

[02:35:56.820 --> 02:35:57.440]
soccer match.

[02:35:57.820 --> 02:35:58.680]
You shoot for the goal, if

[02:35:58.680 --> 02:35:59.420]
you ever get close enough

[02:35:59.420 --> 02:36:00.180]
with a hundred yards.

[02:36:00.980 --> 02:36:01.340]
1172.

[02:36:01.700 --> 02:36:02.880]
20 votes in 22 minutes.

[02:36:02.920 --> 02:36:03.580]
That's really more than

[02:36:03.580 --> 02:36:03.960]
one minute.

[02:36:05.100 --> 02:36:05.840]
Now, we got the oxygen

[02:36:05.840 --> 02:36:06.900]
tanks in yet for, uh,

[02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:08.620]
well, that's right.

[02:36:08.640 --> 02:36:09.360]
Speaking of helium,

[02:36:09.620 --> 02:36:10.880]
first we got the helium tank

[02:36:10.880 --> 02:36:11.600]
and it keeps yelling

[02:36:11.600 --> 02:36:12.440]
going, before then we got

[02:36:12.440 --> 02:36:12.820]
the hopper.

[02:36:13.200 --> 02:36:14.880]
For two and a half long

[02:36:14.880 --> 02:36:16.120]
hours, four to six-

[02:36:16.120 --> 02:36:16.280]
thirty.

[02:36:17.460 --> 02:36:17.920]
Now, we're going to have

[02:36:17.920 --> 02:36:18.900]
Ira win back on today

[02:36:18.900 --> 02:36:19.580]
or Bino.

[02:36:20.840 --> 02:36:21.200]
Gaskin.

[02:36:21.200 --> 02:36:21.940]
Who?

[02:36:22.400 --> 02:36:23.700]
No, it's just, I'm just

[02:36:23.700 --> 02:36:24.660]
saying, I say, I say, I

[02:36:24.660 --> 02:36:24.660]

[02:36:24.940 --> 02:36:25.620]
I'm not asking anybody.

[02:36:25.780 --> 02:36:26.720]
Say, rhetorical question.

[02:36:26.740 --> 02:36:27.320]
Whatever that means.

[02:36:27.580 --> 02:36:29.720]
It's the twa Friday, you

[02:36:29.720 --> 02:36:30.360]
bastard.

[02:36:31.660 --> 02:36:34.220]
And then the Lord said,

[02:36:34.660 --> 02:36:36.200]
let there be light and

[02:36:37.040 --> 02:36:39.780]
Lord, there was light from

[02:36:39.780 --> 02:36:41.460]
the same people who brought

[02:36:41.460 --> 02:36:43.200]
to the much beloved talking

[02:36:43.200 --> 02:36:46.180]
Bible comes a new ten volume

[02:36:46.180 --> 02:36:48.020]
set, brilliantly updated

[02:36:48.020 --> 02:36:49.140]
for the eighties.

[02:36:49.840 --> 02:36:52.520]
Yes, it's the rapping Bible.

[02:36:53.080 --> 02:36:54.140]
That was dark everywhere.

[02:36:55.080 --> 02:36:55.820]
Then the man said,

[02:36:55.920 --> 02:36:57.160]
the light was there.

[02:36:57.320 --> 02:36:58.500]
He said, I've done good.

[02:36:58.860 --> 02:37:00.320]
There's no doubt on the seventh

[02:37:00.320 --> 02:37:00.680]
day.

[02:37:01.240 --> 02:37:02.320]
He just chill out.

[02:37:02.540 --> 02:37:03.220]
Jenna sits.

[02:37:03.720 --> 02:37:04.240]
Jenna sits.

[02:37:04.740 --> 02:37:05.580]
Beginning of that.

[02:37:05.880 --> 02:37:06.780]
Beginning of this.

[02:37:07.080 --> 02:37:08.260]
Finally, a good book.

[02:37:09.440 --> 02:37:10.460]
And here's where it is.

[02:37:10.660 --> 02:37:11.840]
Max Bell checking out.

[02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:12.680]
There's a town called

[02:37:12.680 --> 02:37:14.040]
Sotter and Dora.

[02:37:14.940 --> 02:37:15.940]
Everybody's like, no

[02:37:15.940 --> 02:37:16.360]
tomorrow.

[02:37:16.860 --> 02:37:17.960]
God's a damn set.

[02:37:18.120 --> 02:37:18.740]
Now my fault.

[02:37:18.740 --> 02:37:20.920]
Don't look back or you turn to

[02:37:20.920 --> 02:37:21.280]
saw.

[02:37:21.520 --> 02:37:22.480]
The sweat is at the peak.

[02:37:22.840 --> 02:37:23.480]
Stun it to drink.

[02:37:23.880 --> 02:37:25.120]
The cow came up and

[02:37:25.120 --> 02:37:25.840]
next to her cheek.

[02:37:26.140 --> 02:37:26.960]
Take a next y'all.

[02:37:27.340 --> 02:37:28.180]
I'll be cheeky y'all.

[02:37:28.520 --> 02:37:30.100]
Imagine all the song.

[02:37:30.560 --> 02:37:31.400]
All the parables.

[02:37:31.860 --> 02:37:33.160]
Every sacred, difficult word.

[02:37:33.500 --> 02:37:34.680]
Interpreted by the finest

[02:37:34.680 --> 02:37:36.580]
sucker MCs of all time.

[02:37:36.760 --> 02:37:37.200]
Genesis.

[02:37:38.440 --> 02:37:38.800]
Exodus.

[02:37:40.280 --> 02:37:40.840]
Deuteron.

[02:37:42.100 --> 02:37:42.260]
Deuteron.

[02:37:42.780 --> 02:37:44.020]
The rapping Bible.

[02:37:44.620 --> 02:37:45.220]
Making his word

[02:37:45.220 --> 02:37:45.740]
Dress again.

[02:37:46.540 --> 02:37:47.120]
The Bible.

[02:37:47.460 --> 02:37:47.700]
The Genesis.

[02:37:47.900 --> 02:37:48.820]
Is that like top liver or

[02:37:48.820 --> 02:37:48.980]
what?

[02:37:49.080 --> 02:37:49.980]
That's where all the pro-vision

[02:37:49.980 --> 02:37:50.180]
are.

[02:37:50.320 --> 02:37:52.100]
And don't touch that.

[02:37:52.280 --> 02:37:53.660]
And don't beat no ice cream today.

[02:37:55.060 --> 02:37:55.680]
What do you think?

[02:37:55.860 --> 02:37:56.340]
Please don't.

[02:37:57.120 --> 02:37:58.220]
I mean, please don't.

[02:37:58.300 --> 02:37:59.060]
I'll do whatever the high

[02:37:59.060 --> 02:37:59.400]
line will be.

[02:37:59.400 --> 02:37:59.900]
I know you will.

[02:38:00.220 --> 02:38:01.120]
Just don't be getting

[02:38:01.120 --> 02:38:01.520]
pushed in.

[02:38:01.520 --> 02:38:02.360]
Don't be getting pushed in.

[02:38:02.640 --> 02:38:03.640]
I don't think I want any.

[02:38:04.340 --> 02:38:04.880]
Look at that.

[02:38:04.940 --> 02:38:05.340]
It's 68.

[02:38:05.500 --> 02:38:06.500]
It's going to be 75.

[02:38:06.700 --> 02:38:07.300]
The sun is shining.

[02:38:07.420 --> 02:38:08.100]
Man, what a wonderful.

[02:38:08.240 --> 02:38:09.100]
It's a little hazy though.

[02:38:10.400 --> 02:38:10.760]
1184.

[02:38:11.300 --> 02:38:13.200]
We need 16 votes and 16 minutes.

[02:38:13.440 --> 02:38:14.120]
I'm sure Chris has

[02:38:14.120 --> 02:38:15.540]
got a big smile on this push now.

[02:38:15.540 --> 02:38:16.400]
Can you tell between the

[02:38:16.400 --> 02:38:16.900]
rolls of fat?

[02:38:17.580 --> 02:38:17.680]
Huh?

[02:38:19.460 --> 02:38:20.560]
Well, I mean, I think you

[02:38:20.560 --> 02:38:21.220]
believe you're in.

[02:38:21.380 --> 02:38:22.580]
But it's just, you're in.

[02:38:22.860 --> 02:38:23.340]
Maybe we're going to give it

[02:38:23.340 --> 02:38:24.740]
the next time I click that,

[02:38:24.740 --> 02:38:25.640]
it's going to be a big chunk

[02:38:25.640 --> 02:38:26.420]
on there because it's just

[02:38:26.420 --> 02:38:26.940]
not happening.

[02:38:27.320 --> 02:38:28.340]
That bothers me a lot.

[02:38:28.760 --> 02:38:29.180]
Do you believe me?

[02:38:29.640 --> 02:38:29.880]
Nope.

[02:38:30.440 --> 02:38:30.880]
Oh, okay.

[02:38:31.060 --> 02:38:31.600]
Well, I make it up.

[02:38:31.680 --> 02:38:33.060]
Just to try to, it's the

[02:38:33.060 --> 02:38:33.500]
psych thing.

[02:38:33.600 --> 02:38:34.780]
If you move quickly, you know,

[02:38:34.800 --> 02:38:36.560]
if you call now, like Mr.

[02:38:36.740 --> 02:38:37.340]
Ego, look where Scott

[02:38:37.340 --> 02:38:38.180]
him doing that stuff.

[02:38:39.260 --> 02:38:40.340]
Got him to be a born again

[02:38:40.340 --> 02:38:41.840]
Christian adopting 85 kids.

[02:38:42.140 --> 02:38:43.080]
I totally Nick Lawrence is

[02:38:43.080 --> 02:38:44.420]
one of our, uh, my space.

[02:38:44.420 --> 02:38:45.240]
Well, there's a vote.

[02:38:45.300 --> 02:38:46.200]
See, I told you there's one

[02:38:46.200 --> 02:38:46.560]
coming in.

[02:38:46.560 --> 02:38:48.020]
We need 15 votes in 15 minutes.

[02:38:49.140 --> 02:38:50.340]
We need 16 tons.

[02:38:50.340 --> 02:38:51.400]
You load 16 tons.

[02:38:51.400 --> 02:38:52.040]
And what are you good?

[02:38:52.760 --> 02:38:54.000]
Another day older and deeper

[02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:54.320]
in debt.

[02:38:54.560 --> 02:38:55.140]
That's my story.

[02:38:56.440 --> 02:38:57.460]
St. Peter don't call me

[02:38:57.460 --> 02:38:58.420]
because I can't go.

[02:38:58.720 --> 02:39:00.500]
I owe my soul to the company

[02:39:00.500 --> 02:39:01.780]
stole Tennessee.

[02:39:01.900 --> 02:39:02.580]
Only for a baby.

[02:39:02.680 --> 02:39:03.440]
It was number one for

[02:39:03.440 --> 02:39:04.280]
a hundred weeks in a row.

[02:39:04.520 --> 02:39:05.400]
Well, the music was sure

[02:39:05.400 --> 02:39:06.640]
corny back then in the 50s.

[02:39:06.700 --> 02:39:06.980]
You know what?

[02:39:07.280 --> 02:39:08.820]
You load 16 tons.

[02:39:09.100 --> 02:39:09.700]
And what are you good?

[02:39:10.340 --> 02:39:10.920]
I bet you're chicken

[02:39:10.920 --> 02:39:12.280]
I remember is that real, real big.

[02:39:13.080 --> 02:39:14.720]
He's on Capitol records too, by the way.

[02:39:14.800 --> 02:39:15.620]
Chicken, Tennessee or any

[02:39:15.620 --> 02:39:16.700]
Ford with a mustache.

[02:39:17.320 --> 02:39:18.380]
You ever see him?

[02:39:18.400 --> 02:39:18.460]
You ever see him?

[02:39:18.460 --> 02:39:18.980]
You know who that is?

[02:39:19.220 --> 02:39:19.320]
Sure.

[02:39:19.440 --> 02:39:20.180]
And he was on I Love Lucy.

[02:39:20.180 --> 02:39:20.800]
That one episode.

[02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:22.260]
That's a cousin early.

[02:39:23.120 --> 02:39:23.880]
I love Lucy.

[02:39:25.560 --> 02:39:27.020]
Here's that Germany story.

[02:39:27.200 --> 02:39:28.400]
Each be nine Berliner, by the way.

[02:39:28.400 --> 02:39:28.760]
Don't forget.

[02:39:29.020 --> 02:39:29.520]
Oh boy.

[02:39:29.600 --> 02:39:30.180]
Do I like it there?

[02:39:30.260 --> 02:39:30.660]
I was a little slow.

[02:39:30.660 --> 02:39:32.040]
I think you just have to go right now.

[02:39:32.320 --> 02:39:33.240]
Otherwise I have this.

[02:39:33.700 --> 02:39:35.020]
Just forget I had a sign.

[02:39:35.240 --> 02:39:35.340]
No.

[02:39:37.440 --> 02:39:39.300]
People say a man is made

[02:39:39.300 --> 02:39:40.040]
know what I'm on.

[02:39:40.200 --> 02:39:41.200]
But they make the voice deeper

[02:39:41.200 --> 02:39:41.660]
than us.

[02:39:41.660 --> 02:39:43.400]
Through the way we stand,

[02:39:43.560 --> 02:39:44.100]
the balls of the nose.

[02:39:44.640 --> 02:39:46.000]
Then the blood, then the skin.

[02:39:46.460 --> 02:39:46.860]
Then the bones.

[02:39:47.280 --> 02:39:50.040]
The mind that's a weekend, the back, that's strong.

[02:39:50.300 --> 02:39:51.660]
You load 16 tons.

[02:39:52.400 --> 02:39:53.360]
Oh, you get...

[02:39:53.360 --> 02:39:54.800]
Tell me as to the...

[02:39:54.800 --> 02:39:54.940]
Yes.

[02:39:55.500 --> 02:39:56.480]
Older and deeper and then.

[02:39:56.580 --> 02:39:58.720]
Now do you think it's true that guys with...

[02:39:58.720 --> 02:39:59.940]
I don't know that you would know of course,

[02:40:00.100 --> 02:40:02.980]
but guys with deep voices have gigantic cajones,

[02:40:03.000 --> 02:40:03.960]
necessarily no.

[02:40:04.180 --> 02:40:04.300]
Oh.

[02:40:05.040 --> 02:40:06.480]
I should probably know the answer to that.

[02:40:06.580 --> 02:40:07.480]
Although I don't know.

[02:40:08.560 --> 02:40:09.620]
I never really thought about it.

[02:40:09.620 --> 02:40:10.140]
Take a survey.

[02:40:10.140 --> 02:40:12.340]
Okay, I'll know.

[02:40:12.620 --> 02:40:12.860]
I'll know.

[02:40:12.860 --> 02:40:13.160]
I'll know.

[02:40:13.860 --> 02:40:15.120]
I'll know.

[02:40:15.120 --> 02:40:15.820]
I'll know.

[02:40:15.980 --> 02:40:16.240]
I'll know.

[02:40:16.240 --> 02:40:16.240]

[02:40:16.240 --> 02:40:16.240]

[02:40:16.520 --> 02:40:17.360]
I'll know.

[02:40:17.360 --> 02:40:17.360]

[02:40:17.360 --> 02:40:17.360]

[02:40:17.480 --> 02:40:18.000]
I'll know.

[02:40:18.500 --> 02:40:18.800]
I'll know.

[02:40:18.800 --> 02:40:18.960]
I'll know.

[02:40:19.080 --> 02:40:19.720]
I'll know.

[02:40:20.200 --> 02:40:20.820]
I'll know.

[02:40:20.820 --> 02:40:21.020]
I'll know.

[02:40:21.880 --> 02:40:23.660]
I'll know.

[02:40:24.740 --> 02:40:25.580]
I'll know.

[02:40:25.940 --> 02:40:27.120]
I'll know.

[02:40:27.180 --> 02:40:27.680]
I'll know.

[02:40:28.040 --> 02:40:28.260]
I'll know.

[02:40:28.920 --> 02:40:29.820]
I'll know.

[02:40:29.820 --> 02:40:30.340]
I'll know.

[02:40:33.160 --> 02:40:34.000]
I'll know.

[02:40:34.600 --> 02:40:35.440]
I'll know.

[02:40:37.780 --> 02:40:39.460]
I'll know.

[02:40:39.460 --> 02:40:40.120]
I'll know.

[02:40:55.120 --> 02:40:58.120]
Two days and four days Mid Northeast

[02:40:58.120 --> 02:40:58.700]
Men时 we live in Henry,

[02:40:58.700 --> 02:40:58.700]

[02:40:58.700 --> 02:40:58.700]

[02:40:58.700 --> 02:40:58.700]

[02:40:58.700 --> 02:40:58.700]

[02:40:58.700 --> 02:40:58.700]

[02:40:58.700 --> 02:40:58.700]

[02:40:58.700 --> 02:40:58.700]

[02:40:58.700 --> 02:40:58.700]

[02:40:58.700 --> 02:40:58.760]
Henry.

[02:40:58.760 --> 02:40:58.760]

[02:40:58.760 --> 02:40:58.760]

[02:40:58.760 --> 02:40:58.820]
Henry.

[02:40:58.820 --> 02:40:58.820]

[02:40:58.820 --> 02:40:58.820]

[02:40:58.820 --> 02:40:58.840]
Henry,

[02:40:58.840 --> 02:40:58.900]
I got this news on Donny Season 2.

[02:40:58.900 --> 02:40:58.900]

[02:40:58.900 --> 02:40:58.900]

[02:40:58.900 --> 02:40:58.900]

[02:40:58.900 --> 02:40:58.900]

[02:40:58.900 --> 02:40:58.900]

[02:40:58.900 --> 02:40:58.900]

[02:40:58.900 --> 02:40:58.920]
laughter

[02:40:58.920 --> 02:40:58.920]

[02:40:58.920 --> 02:40:59.060]
就

[02:40:59.060 --> 02:41:05.420]
If it wasn't me I would steal any of those

[02:41:05.480 --> 02:41:06.500]
for sick children.

[02:41:09.740 --> 02:41:10.100]
No.

[02:41:10.100 --> 02:41:10.100]

[02:41:06.120 --> 02:41:06.320]
canmil

[02:41:06.320 --> 02:41:07.120]
NO.

[02:41:07.120 --> 02:41:08.620]
ç

[02:41:08.620 --> 02:41:09.080]
Unis

[02:41:09.080 --> 02:41:09.880]
sensing

[02:41:10.100 --> 02:41:13.560]
franchise in Europe, a franchise, is that like Taco Bell or what, a franchise.

[02:41:14.600 --> 02:41:17.740]
Other members of the intelligence committee told CNN they felt the threat information

[02:41:17.740 --> 02:41:18.980]
was vague on timing.

[02:41:19.580 --> 02:41:22.400]
The Department of Homeland Security issued, and remember what I've been telling you, everything

[02:41:22.400 --> 02:41:23.100]
in life is timing.

[02:41:23.380 --> 02:41:26.720]
Ninety percent of life is timing, being in the right place in the right time, or vice

[02:41:26.720 --> 02:41:27.080]
diversity.

[02:41:27.800 --> 02:41:30.840]
The Department of Homeland Security issued a statement saying there was no credible intelligence

[02:41:30.840 --> 02:41:32.740]
to suggest an internet threat on US soil.

[02:41:33.660 --> 02:41:37.560]
The US State Department made from 20th Senate on a war, it's his warden message.

[02:41:37.780 --> 02:41:38.880]
Do you think they mean warning message?

[02:41:39.220 --> 02:41:39.680]
Warden message.

[02:41:39.760 --> 02:41:40.480]
What's a warden message?

[02:41:41.060 --> 02:41:41.320]
I don't know.

[02:41:41.960 --> 02:41:45.060]
I think it's a typo here by the, if I see an end, they suck.

[02:41:45.680 --> 02:41:49.000]
Saying US diplomatic and consular facilities in Germany are increasing their security

[02:41:49.000 --> 02:41:52.320]
posture, we're taking these steps in response to a heightened threat situation.

[02:41:52.640 --> 02:41:55.840]
By increasing their posture, did they mean they're like, who's stepping?

[02:41:56.020 --> 02:41:56.520]
Is that what it is?

[02:41:57.420 --> 02:41:59.800]
Because that should be fit in with the times in which we live, baby.

[02:42:00.120 --> 02:42:00.600]
Who's stepping?

[02:42:01.540 --> 02:42:04.580]
They had a level of concern, sufficient to cause the news of the warden message.

[02:42:04.740 --> 02:42:05.280]
That's the right word.

[02:42:05.380 --> 02:42:07.000]
I don't know what that means, a warden message, you?

[02:42:07.620 --> 02:42:08.220]
No, I don't.

[02:42:08.900 --> 02:42:12.520]
State Department spokesman Sean McCormick said today asked about the reports of a terrorist

[02:42:12.520 --> 02:42:15.280]
plopping discovery said, I don't have anything new on that.

[02:42:16.480 --> 02:42:21.660]
German interior minister Wolfgang Scheibel told ABC Wolfgang, the danger level is high

[02:42:21.660 --> 02:42:24.180]
and we're part of the global threat by Islamist terrorism.

[02:42:25.580 --> 02:42:29.120]
US air marshals are providing additional protection or flights between Germany and the

[02:42:29.120 --> 02:42:30.480]
US law enforcement officials.

[02:42:30.780 --> 02:42:32.920]
So I wouldn't be flying to Frankfurt anytime soon if I were you.

[02:42:33.060 --> 02:42:34.080]
I mean, you can go ahead.

[02:42:34.440 --> 02:42:34.900]
Frankfurt.

[02:42:35.780 --> 02:42:36.680]
It would have been to Frankfurt.

[02:42:36.940 --> 02:42:37.240]
It's crap.

[02:42:37.960 --> 02:42:38.860]
I don't like it.

[02:42:39.420 --> 02:42:41.060]
Hamburg was a beautiful city, but I don't know.

[02:42:41.740 --> 02:42:43.040]
It was not the same.

[02:42:43.400 --> 02:42:47.560]
But Frankfurt is very low, I don't know, it's like the financial center, but not a tourist

[02:42:47.560 --> 02:42:47.940]
place.

[02:42:49.240 --> 02:42:52.820]
And the people there are mostly from Morocco and Algeria, they're not like real German.

[02:42:54.020 --> 02:42:55.260]
Like in Berlin and Cologne.

[02:42:55.720 --> 02:42:58.660]
Although maybe the people in Berlin and Cologne are not real Germans, maybe the real Germans

[02:42:58.660 --> 02:43:01.800]
are like the one in Frankfurt, like Hennellas, Slavily and Slope.

[02:43:01.940 --> 02:43:02.480]
I don't think so.

[02:43:03.800 --> 02:43:09.140]
I think the real German people are the beautiful people in Berlin and in Cologne, HB9

[02:43:09.140 --> 02:43:09.440]
Berlin.

[02:43:10.000 --> 02:43:11.720]
1193, you need seven votes, you got 11 minutes.

[02:43:11.840 --> 02:43:13.000]
That should be a shoe in.

[02:43:13.500 --> 02:43:13.960]
Shouldn't it?

[02:43:14.540 --> 02:43:15.240]
Yes, it would be.

[02:43:15.300 --> 02:43:17.080]
That was George Tenant said it's a slam dunk.

[02:43:18.620 --> 02:43:18.980]
1194.

[02:43:19.920 --> 02:43:22.140]
1194, see there's another one, you got 10 minutes for six votes.

[02:43:22.300 --> 02:43:23.620]
Let's stay on until we get to 1200.

[02:43:24.180 --> 02:43:26.480]
Even if it's like 215, Geli won't mind.

[02:43:28.580 --> 02:43:30.580]
And the audience certainly will be upset about that.

[02:43:30.580 --> 02:43:32.440]
Geli will be on a two for a mad dog, Seth.

[02:43:32.640 --> 02:43:32.640]

[02:43:33.440 --> 02:43:36.520]
I was Geli going to tell us what's going to happen when the hockey games go someplace else

[02:43:36.520 --> 02:43:38.600]
or is he swore in a secrecy on that?

[02:43:40.180 --> 02:43:40.800]
You guys can meet.

[02:43:41.240 --> 02:43:41.680]
I don't know.

[02:43:41.820 --> 02:43:43.400]
I'm just asking out loud.

[02:43:43.580 --> 02:43:45.800]
You know what I'm watching the numbers on here.

[02:43:45.880 --> 02:43:46.500]
I'm thinking out loud.

[02:43:46.500 --> 02:43:49.860]
I don't want to like sit here and leave like the sounds of silence for Christ's sakes.

[02:43:50.140 --> 02:43:52.900]
What are you thinking about leaving me to?

[02:43:53.200 --> 02:43:54.060]
I'm thinking about lunch.

[02:43:55.700 --> 02:43:56.520]
And you know what?

[02:43:56.620 --> 02:43:57.460]
I bet it doesn't love 96.

[02:43:57.460 --> 02:44:01.020]
We need four votes and we got 10 minutes, 9 minutes and the 16 seconds to do it.

[02:44:01.100 --> 02:44:01.980]
Easy, piece of cake.

[02:44:02.620 --> 02:44:04.500]
I'm not going to have another lunch like I did the other day.

[02:44:04.600 --> 02:44:08.780]
Although, if I started getting a whole bunch of text messages like I did Wednesday,

[02:44:09.180 --> 02:44:11.400]
I might just have a big lunch.

[02:44:12.200 --> 02:44:13.760]
Because that's what put me over the edge.

[02:44:13.880 --> 02:44:14.620]
Read all of that stuff.

[02:44:14.780 --> 02:44:17.120]
I thought, oh no, I just, I got so distraught.

[02:44:17.180 --> 02:44:17.440]
You know what I mean?

[02:44:17.960 --> 02:44:20.280]
And during that whole big lunch, the messages kept coming in.

[02:44:20.860 --> 02:44:21.840]
The hits kept on coming.

[02:44:22.680 --> 02:44:24.200]
Or at least the messages did anyway.

[02:44:24.760 --> 02:44:25.180]
Three minutes.

[02:44:25.960 --> 02:44:28.040]
Three votes to go till Trump 100.

[02:44:28.280 --> 02:44:29.280]
What do you got on yours, Chris?

[02:44:30.360 --> 02:44:30.720]
1197.

[02:44:31.180 --> 02:44:31.980]
Oh, for a crime.

[02:44:32.080 --> 02:44:34.800]
Come on, let's get this thing over where they always do this stuff.

[02:44:34.880 --> 02:44:40.140]
I bet you there's three people out there and they got their finger up in here and they're just ready to tap that baby and the poll too.

[02:44:40.680 --> 02:44:41.620]
They're ready to tap the poll.

[02:44:42.100 --> 02:44:43.040]
Wouldn't be the first time.

[02:44:44.680 --> 02:44:49.320]
I keep hitting that view current thing, view current, view current, and it just, it just ain't happening, man.

[02:44:50.280 --> 02:44:51.500]
I think maybe we maxed out.

[02:44:51.580 --> 02:44:52.600]
Maybe that's the whole audience now.

[02:44:52.940 --> 02:44:53.280]
1197.

[02:44:55.940 --> 02:44:56.880]
You got anything more?

[02:44:57.920 --> 02:44:58.100]
No.

[02:44:59.240 --> 02:45:00.100]
Either one of you, huh?

[02:45:00.380 --> 02:45:00.460]
No.

[02:45:01.700 --> 02:45:02.040]
1197.

[02:45:02.260 --> 02:45:02.960]
We need three more votes.

[02:45:03.080 --> 02:45:04.720]
We got eight minutes and 12 seconds to do it.

[02:45:04.920 --> 02:45:06.820]
Now you folks out there, you know damn well you can do it.

[02:45:06.880 --> 02:45:09.140]
Even if you voted 50 times already, you can write again.
