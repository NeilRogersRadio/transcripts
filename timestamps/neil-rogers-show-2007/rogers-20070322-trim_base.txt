[00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:27.100]
One number present in two.

[00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.180]
Spent for England.

[00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.820]
Second.

[00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:45.540]
God knows.

I don't know.

[00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.760]
Who won the Civil War?

[00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.860]
I don't know.

[00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:50.300]

[00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.580]
What is the capital of Florida?

[00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:53.300]
Maybe.

[00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.160]
I don't know.

[00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.160]
Who fought in the Spanish American War?

[00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.240]
I don't know about wars.

[00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.260]
If you travel directly north from the United States,

[00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.800]
what country will you be in?

[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.280]

[00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:06.820]

Fifty-two.

[00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:22.720]
Fifty-two.

[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.320]
Who won the Civil War?

[00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.340]
The way?

[00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:26.740]
The Civil War.

[00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:28.820]
The way it was the South.

[00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.600]
The South was great.

[00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.680]
Who will fight in the Spanish American War?

[00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:33.960]
I don't know.

[00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.640]
I have no idea.

[00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.340]
One number present in two.

[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.280]
Spent Franklin.

[00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:38.340]
Who knew you did?

[00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.120]
The only choice of friends it was.

[00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.660]
I am Annie from the Kenyan boom money show.

[00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:43.620]
What's your first name?

[00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:44.320]

[00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.880]
How many stars are on the US flag?

[00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:48.580]

[00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:49.220]
Fifty-two.

[00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:50.580]
Who won the Civil War?

[00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:51.300]
You're Americans.

[00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.260]
What is the capital of Florida?

[00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.520]
Um, it's actually one number present in two.

[00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.420]
Spent Franklin.

[00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.040]
I don't know what American history.

[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:00.400]
I know.

[00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:01.340]
It's not an American.

[00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:02.260]
Thank you.

[00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.500]
The music expressed on the previous program.

[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:05.000]
All right.

[00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:06.320]
The host, guest and girl.

[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.620]
All right.

[00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.320]
Have you not reflected those of the music?

[00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.360]
You can't complain about the intellect of South Florida,

[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:11.480]
because there ain't any.

[00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.740]
I thought the West wanted Civil War, didn't they?

[00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:17.520]
The West, young man.

[00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:18.880]
Do you hear me?

[00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:20.980]
Miami Ford Flutter Day.

[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.940]
That was nice.

[00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.380]
Yeah.

[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.960]
Incredible.

[00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:28.240]
It's easy.

[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.100]
All is well.

[00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.700]
And we're out here at 1250, baby.

[00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:32.260]
I love it.

[00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.240]
I love those marlins and the Cardinals too.

[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.780]
I'm gonna get out of here.

[00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.480]
I'll tell you the rest of them.

[00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.120]
I'm gonna pass it me fast.

[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.420]
Sometimes I'll feel the people have to smile.

[00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.940]
I'm gonna pass it to you.

[00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.100]
So, you take it all by the way.

[00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.500]
Shot.

[00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.400]
Oh.

[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.580]
You're gonna pass it to you.

[00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:57.100]
Show.

[00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.840]
Half of you are the soul race.

[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:01.600]
You know.

[00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.200]
The movement rear-hundred is an outright lie.

[00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:13.740]
It is an attack.

[00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.560]
An holy people's are around

[00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.820]
are revered by some ancestors.

[00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.960]
The American cultural officials

[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:25.400]
have declared psychological warfare against the whole

[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.620]
it.

[00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:27.780]
Country of a run.

[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.900]
But we, being a peaceful people,

[00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:36.720]
will only demand the American doctor's

[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.120]
responsible for this atrocity.

[00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.280]
To be turned over to us,

[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.280]
poor immediate and very humane beheading.

[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.120]
After of course the whipping starting and removal of appendages.

[00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.600]
Upper as nice and

[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.220]
Alexe Paul one and Nancy Pelosi.

[00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.300]
I was sure as this will happen.

[00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:59.500]
If this does not come to,

[00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:00.900]
I'll say, fruition.

[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.900]
There is always the nuclear option.

[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.980]
Make a leka high, make a honey hole.

[00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:09.740]
Include some deep blood.

[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.260]
Not my one.

[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.320]
The president of Iran.

[00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.020]
Hiho is exactly worth that.

[00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.580]
10 out of 205, 60 WPM.

[00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.140]
So what difference does it make if you know what the,

[00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.180]
what country is if you go straight north

[00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.000]
of the Westward country you come into?

[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:23.740]
I love that.

[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:24.380]
Nobody important.

[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:25.560]
Nobody importants up there.

[00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.460]
That's right.

[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:27.460]
Nobody important in Canada.

[00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.400]
Canada sucks is what we heard all day yesterday.

[00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.160]
Yeah, that's what I keep hearing.

[00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.840]
As if I were to give a crap about any Yahoo's opinion

[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.600]
about Canada or any other place on the map.

[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.640]
You know, it's always great when people have opinions

[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.520]
about places that not only don't they have they never been there,

[00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.300]
but they wouldn't know where to find it if you paid them

[00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.140]
by the second, you know.

[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.920]
I can be $100 if you show me where Canada is on the map.

[00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.440]
Wow, I don't know like that.

[00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:50.740]
So George is out sick today.

[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:51.800]
10 past eight this morning.

[00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.380]
I get a text message from George saying,

[00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:54.280]
I'm sick.

[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:55.980]
I'm dying over here and so I said,

[00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.500]
well, he said, Josh is coming.

[00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.000]
I guess you have to message at the same time.

[00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.620]
I got it.

[00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:00.260]
And I'm here.

[00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:01.280]
Well, that's good.

[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.260]
And we're all getting paid.

[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.140]
And that's all we care about.

[00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:04.740]
Stations that got money coming in.

[00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.700]
Hand over fist.

[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:06.400]
That's all we care.

[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.320]
We don't care if we have a point one in the next book.

[00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:11.060]
How do you like that?

[00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.160]
All of we would like our friends out there to help us tremendously

[00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:14.460]
on this show between 10 and two,

[00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:15.740]
because that would be kind of like a,

[00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.100]
it would be deflating, you know, to my old ego.

[00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:19.780]
I don't want to go out like some kind of a clown.

[00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:22.060]
Like yesterday's show, for example,

[00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.240]
I mean, you talk about a clown.

[00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.420]
Well, what we on the scale of minus infinity,

[00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:26.380]
what would you give that Chris?

[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:27.800]
See, that was my bad though.

[00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.680]
I take I'm not going to blame anybody else for it.

[00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.760]
Because something worked on Monday and then amazingly on Tuesday,

[00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.740]
the idea that was going to happen again yesterday,

[00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.280]
I should know better than that.

[00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:37.760]
And here's living proof of it right here.

[00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:38.620]
First call.

[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:40.080]
Hello.

[00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:41.660]
Oh, see?

[00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:42.380]
There you go.

[00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:43.080]
Oh, boy.

[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.880]
Well, that's his, that's his own private line now.

[00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:47.480]
Prozac wrong.

[00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:48.680]
He's got his own private line.

[00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:49.300]
Hi.

[00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:51.080]
Nice.

[00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.260]
That's so the idea that I'm going to go through that again.

[00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:56.920]
Don't hold your breath for a repeat of that anytime soon.

[00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:58.380]
That's just my best suggestion to you.

[00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:01.380]
Okay, here's the epitome.

[00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:02.460]
What stuff load is all about?

[00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.380]
I would love I'd like to have heard

[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:07.500]
where those college students, you of them probably.

[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.080]
Wouldn't you think most of them?

[00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:11.700]
I can find out where he did that.

[00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:14.800]
Yeah, let's find out where Manny did that thing yesterday.

[00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:15.460]
That was cute.

[00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:16.740]
What university?

[00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:20.400]
What institution of higher yearning were they going to?

[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.000]
And all you college kids out there, there's only one thing that's important.

[00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:24.600]
Not learning a bunch of useless facts.

[00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:26.020]
Okay, just getting laid.

[00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:27.240]
That's the only thing that's important.

[00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:28.680]
I'm telling you that right now.

[00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:29.120]
Am I right?

[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:29.740]
I agree.

[00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:30.700]
Yeah, there you go.

[00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:31.500]
What do you think Chris?

[00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:32.800]
Oh, I totally agree.

[00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:35.620]
All those useless facts that they teach in high school and college.

[00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:38.880]
Oh, gee, it's so important to know the capital of a U.S. Slavvy.

[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:40.080]
What do I know more U.S. Slavvy?

[00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:40.640]
How do you like that?

[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:41.680]
Ha ha ha.

[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:42.480]
How do you like that?

[00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:43.280]
Trick question.

[00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:44.780]
Like that Ben Franklin question.

[00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:48.820]
If somebody asked me what number of president Ben Franklin would

[00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:50.560]
say, was I'd tell him to go fly a kite?

[00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:51.740]
How do you like them apples, huh?

[00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:52.360]
There you go.

[00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:55.740]
This story epitomizes what South Florida is all about.

[00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:57.500]
For those people who give me this song in the day,

[00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:58.740]
they'll kind of just suck some.

[00:06:58.960 --> 00:06:59.260]
Yeah, great.

[00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:00.520]
Then don't ever go to Canada.

[00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:01.500]
That's my best suggestion.

[00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:01.820]
OK.

[00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:03.560]
Stay exactly where you are.

[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:06.000]
Over to this WQA and hello.

[00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:09.200]
Hi, I'm Andy and that was wrong with Florida.

[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:12.360]
Yeah, amen.

[00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:12.740]
All right.

[00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:13.240]
Amen.

[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:13.900]
That's a good one.

[00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:14.560]
That's a good one.

[00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:17.520]
Actually, that was in better quality than the actual interview.

[00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:18.380]
I don't know if you noticed that.

[00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:18.700]
Yeah.

[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:23.460]
A Southbound Florida East Coast railway trained collided with a car

[00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:25.580]
on the track shortly around 740 this morning.

[00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:27.660]
And Linton Boulevard to Dixie Highway in Delray Beach.

[00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:30.920]
But the woman driver got out safely before the crash.

[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:32.460]
Police said this like I said,

[00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:34.380]
it epitomizes what goes on in South Florida.

[00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:39.500]
If you're over the age of 100 and you buy a bunch of box of cracker jacks,

[00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:41.040]
you'll find a Florida driver's license in there.

[00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:43.540]
And you can get it renewed every set for six years at a time.

[00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:44.820]
That's the true story.

[00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:47.760]
When my mother turned 90, she got a six year renewal in the mail.

[00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:48.720]
No eye test.

[00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:50.580]
I know it's not the doing eye test if you're over 80.

[00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:51.960]
But she had no eye test.

[00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:52.740]
No, are you alive?

[00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:53.040]
Test.

[00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:53.320]
No.

[00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:53.900]
I don't.

[00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:56.800]
She could have been like a lump on a chair.

[00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:59.740]
And they would have sent her a new driver's license six years in a mail.

[00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:00.480]
Side unseen.

[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.280]
Atlantic Avenue and Linton Boulevard now open across the train tracks.

[00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:05.240]
This was at 813.

[00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:06.060]
So that's old news.

[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:12.220]
Police said many caspies, 75, who lives west of Delray Beach,

[00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:15.200]
was Eastbound with a light change and the crossing gate came down.

[00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:18.960]
Police said caspies, padded instead of pulling forward off the tracks,

[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:20.720]
bailed out of the car and ran to safety.

[00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:22.060]
She just left the car right there.

[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:25.160]
She wasn't injured but her 2006 Lincoln towncar

[00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:26.140]
was destroyed.

[00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:26.920]
Her Jew canoe.

[00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:30.200]
No one on the slow moving FEC freight train was injured.

[00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:33.420]
Railroad officials complained the accident in fact up south-right.

[00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:36.200]
Southbound rail traffic all the way to St. Augustine.

[00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:40.620]
Talk about where the people are older than Mathewsla's grandpa in St. Augustine.

[00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:41.880]
Isn't that what they're famous for?

[00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:42.540]
Be an ancient.

[00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:49.380]
Many was at 75 and she lives west of Delray Beach and there come the big old train,

[00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:50.900]
luckily going very slowly.

[00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:53.780]
It was a slow moving FEC freight train.

[00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:55.240]
Wish we had that.

[00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:57.280]
Now you don't have access to all of them.

[00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:58.580]
I need songs like George does do you?

[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:00.580]
You know what I listen to again.

[00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:05.420]
I'm sure that although actually Chris liked the yesterday but when I found

[00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:07.780]
when Polka went chicken next sent me up on the roof.

[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.740]
I even got an email on my space page about that from some listener out there saying

[00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:14.600]
I was just a great song.

[00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:17.000]
It is a great song up on the roof by the Crayon James.

[00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:21.080]
From I would say 67, 68th they're about to even went to their website.

[00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:21.880]
There's a Crayon James.

[00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:25.700]
It's C-R-Y-A-N by the way if anybody well looks them up.

[00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:26.700]
Be looking them up.

[00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:30.160]
They also did it could be where in love and there was another one called Spice,

[00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:33.320]
I don't know what that was.

[00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:34.440]
Sugar and Spice, I don't know.

[00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:35.260]
That was a good group.

[00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:36.260]
Columbia Records.

[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:37.160]
Crayon James.

[00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:40.200]
And it's a Crayon James that the Universities is a very short time.

[00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:41.020]
They're probably too good.

[00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:42.920]
Because that's a great.

[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:45.440]
I could just play that until baseball time at 1250.

[00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:48.480]
I could just keep talking it up again like that.

[00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:49.120]
Nailing it.

[00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:49.720]
Nailing it.

[00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:50.340]
Nailing it.

[00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:52.040]
Find something good.

[00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:52.800]
Keep nailing it.

[00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:53.840]
That's my suggestion too.

[00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:56.960]
And then with a sip when they put Jesus up on the cross.

[00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:57.520]
Oh that's bad.

[00:09:57.580 --> 00:09:58.200]
It's almost Easter.

[00:09:58.300 --> 00:09:59.500]
Don't be talking the...

[00:09:59.500 --> 00:09:59.740]
Forever.

[00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:02.120]
No, that's a great song.

[00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:03.840]
I can just keep playing.

[00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:04.740]
I could listen that all day.

[00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:07.000]
Even now, what do you think Josh?

[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:08.540]
I didn't play another bit for you doing that.

[00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:09.560]
That's not your kind of music.

[00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:11.020]
I don't know what that means.

[00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:13.080]
What means?

[00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:14.640]
Well, just like kind of music.

[00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:16.740]
What is your kind of music?

[00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:18.420]
I like music if it's good.

[00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:19.120]
I'll listen to it.

[00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:19.720]
If it's good.

[00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:20.540]
I like it.

[00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:21.120]
Then that's...

[00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:21.940]
You know, it's like sex.

[00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:23.620]
If it's good, what's not to like?

[00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:24.060]
There you go.

[00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:26.060]
So it's the same thing with music,

[00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:26.760]
the same with food.

[00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:27.620]
If the food is good,

[00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:29.380]
although of course there is different tastes.

[00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:29.660]

[00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:31.340]
Yeah, there are different tastes.

[00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:32.820]
Like in phone calls, for example.

[00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:33.800]
WQAM, hello.

[00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:36.100]
Yeah, I wanted to talk to Neil.

[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:37.120]
Speaking sir.

[00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:38.880]
Oh, Neil, how you doing?

[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.520]
I wanted to ask you about an old group

[00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:42.080]
as long as you're talking about old music.

[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:42.600]
I love you.

[00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:44.460]
Lee Andrews in the heart.

[00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:45.460]
Do you remember them?

[00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:45.840]
Yeah.

[00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:47.660]
I sang with Lee Andrews one time.

[00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:48.940]
I don't remember any party.

[00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:51.560]
Yeah, I was a social chairman of a fraternity party

[00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:52.980]
and everybody was drunk and I was.

[00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.960]
I asked him if I could sing pure drops with it.

[00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:56.720]
Back at the University.

[00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:58.180]
That was their big hit, Teardrops.

[00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:00.120]
So 100 years ago, it was a year old like me, huh?

[00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:00.800]
You an old guy?

[00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:03.840]
Yeah, you know, but you're the best, man.

[00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:05.640]
You're the treasure of South Florida.

[00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:06.180]
I am.

[00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:07.340]
Okay, thanks a lot, Pally.

[00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:08.660]
You don't call us again, you're too old.

[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.040]
And I said good guy.

[00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:11.440]
Lee Andrews in the hearts.

[00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:12.720]
Oh, God.

[00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:14.620]
Let's talk some old music today,

[00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:15.520]
because George is out sick.

[00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:17.700]
And what do you guys know about that?

[00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:18.400]
We already got it.

[00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:19.660]
I better find a click if we got 800.

[00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:20.800]
Yeah, we do.

[00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:22.320]
Pretty good pool today, by the way.

[00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:24.480]
Whoever sent it in 807.

[00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:26.300]
Wow, we are in heaven, 807.

[00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:28.580]
We got, let's see, let's take a look at that schedule now.

[00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:33.200]
I'm so happy that I made a recovery from that experiment.

[00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:35.800]
Yes, the show just, at four hours of it too.

[00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:36.900]
Today, no matter what happens,

[00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:38.600]
all the way we've already got a couple of good calls.

[00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:39.120]
Aren't you proud?

[00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:41.060]
Please, please, please, this punch.

[00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:42.440]
That's guys, Josh is here today.

[00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:43.180]
There's one guy.

[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:45.800]
You better watch yourself, because I'm positive he wants you.

[00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:47.380]
Oh, yeah, I've heard this guy.

[00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:48.840]
Yeah, this guy always wants me.

[00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:49.780]
He misses you badly.

[00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:51.640]
In fact, I think he loves you more than I do.

[00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:52.600]
I have a fan.

[00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:53.620]
I love you only a lot.

[00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:56.680]
I leave from a distance, and I've seen each other maybe three times in history.

[00:11:57.920 --> 00:11:58.760]
That's your fault, dude.

[00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:01.260]
You're up in that crappy, uh, crappy.

[00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:02.420]
Let me ask you this.

[00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:04.360]
Okay, if I was down there all the time,

[00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:07.140]
yeah, how much time would you and I spend together?

[00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:08.100]
The answer is none.

[00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:09.360]
Oh, what do you mean?

[00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:09.820]
What do you mean?

[00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:10.420]
I got to work?

[00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:12.960]
Well, we're not into the same thing, Neil.

[00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:16.040]
Well, what does that mean?

[00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:17.460]
We're not into the same things.

[00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:18.680]
Well, you like guys.

[00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:19.340]
We like you.

[00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:21.060]
I like going out and getting hammered.

[00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:22.260]
You and your girlfriend did dinner.

[00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:22.840]
How would that be?

[00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:23.740]
That would be fantastic.

[00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:24.920]
Yeah, how do you like that?

[00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:26.060]
See, with that, with that body,

[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:27.740]
what do you think I'm going to be reaching under the table,

[00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:29.300]
grabbing your leg or something like that?

[00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:31.340]
Well, what I like, man, I get him face.

[00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:32.420]
I think that's what he's hoping for.

[00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:36.820]
Yeah, the interesting thing about Cortis is the first time that he and I ever laid eyes on each other.

[00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:38.540]
At least the first time ever saw him was in the elevator.

[00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:39.840]
I was leaving him after the show.

[00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:40.380]
Yeah.

[00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:43.280]
And you, I mean, you talk about a kissy kissy.

[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:44.060]
It was very nice.

[00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:49.420]
I had worked at the station for, I think, a year and a half before I even said,

[00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:50.700]
that was the first time I saw you.

[00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:51.120]
Yeah.

[00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:52.340]
So I said hello.

[00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:54.180]
He said I'm a good fan of that fat old bag.

[00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:54.800]
Is that's Neil?

[00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:57.300]
Were there birds chirping when you two locked down?

[00:12:57.300 --> 00:12:59.400]
I was very complimentary and a big fan of the show.

[00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:01.480]
And he knew I wasn't going to attack him or anything in the elevator,

[00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:03.680]
because you know, this would have been inappropriate.

[00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:05.760]
It was a hangover, right?

[00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:06.380]
What?

[00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:08.220]
It was a short ride down.

[00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:08.580]
Yeah.

[00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:14.120]
Yeah, but I know where the special button is on the elevator.

[00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:14.860]
Maybe look out.

[00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:15.720]
Oh yeah.

[00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:17.440]
Well, we'll get back into that.

[00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:19.120]
Well, it's nice to have you here today.

[00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:20.160]
We miss you on the show.

[00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:20.840]
I mean, I think not.

[00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:22.760]
And of course Chris is going to take that the wrong way.

[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:23.680]
It's not that we don't like Chris.

[00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:24.900]
Chris is doing a wonderful job.

[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:25.880]
That's what he's going to do right now.

[00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:27.260]
He's doing an excellent job.

[00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:30.320]
But you're, you know, I've got some shoes to fill.

[00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:32.040]
Is that what it is?

[00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:33.360]
Well, yeah, yeah.

[00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:34.820]
Okay, we'll get into the polls.

[00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:36.660]
Tony LaRouce had a little DUI partner.

[00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:39.280]
The manager of your World Champion, St. Louis Cardinals,

[00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:40.080]
and all that other stuff.

[00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:42.120]
I mean, does anybody really care about baseball anymore?

[00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:43.580]
My God, that is so passé.

[00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:45.300]
Oh, it's a good station.

[00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:46.880]
So passé.

[00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:49.780]
Let's just get in a lot of spots and make a lot of money.

[00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:50.560]
Deal?

[00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:51.580]
God?

[00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:55.100]
Several days ago, I commented briefly on some recent statements

[00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:58.280]
that have been made by some members of Congress about Iraq.

[00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:01.440]
And it's important to make this point at the outset.

[00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:04.080]
The president of the United States,

[00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:08.480]
purposely misled the American people on pre-war intelligence.

[00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:13.200]
American soldiers and Marines serving in Iraq go out every day

[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:15.920]
into some of the most dangerous and unpredictable conditions.

[00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:20.880]
These brave Americans were sent into battle for a deliberate falsetto.

[00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:26.080]
Pre-war information was distorted to corrupt the oil for food program.

[00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:30.560]
There is no denying that the president lied to the American people.

[00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:34.380]
This is revisionism of the most corrupt and shameless variety.

[00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:36.460]
It's also something I enjoy.

[00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:39.080]
It's one of the reasons I've stayed in the business.

[00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:43.180]
And I believe the feeling is probably the same for most of us in public life.

[00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:47.280]
The president and his administration hate our country

[00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:49.380]
and hate the liberties for which we stand.

[00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:49.840]
Absolutely.

[00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:51.360]
They dwell on the shadows,

[00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:57.220]
have no regard for the laws of warfare and feel unconstrained by any standard of morality.

[00:14:57.220 --> 00:15:02.060]
The president of the United States is dishonest and reprehensible.

[00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:05.100]
And none of us should want it any other way.

[00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:06.140]
Thank you very much.

[00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:08.660]
Thanks for your attention, Honesty.

[00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:10.760]
It's the 2017-60s.

[00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:12.020]
I give the schedule no I did not.

[00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:13.880]
Marlon's in the Cardinals at 1250.

[00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:17.500]
Well, that's a bad break for the audience that we have to get out of here early.

[00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:18.240]
Oh, man.

[00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:20.560]
Don't ask me about Libbyn because I won't tell you.

[00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:21.820]
Oh, did you lose?

[00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:23.080]
My ass.

[00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:23.840]
Bad.

[00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:25.700]
Bad, bad, bad.

[00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:27.440]
You cannot have a real bad streak, right?

[00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:29.240]
You know, I'm a really nasty streak.

[00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:32.360]
You know, the money I've lost the last two, three weeks of Woodbuyn.

[00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:33.860]
I didn't want to think about it.

[00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:35.200]
But anyway, Marlon's in the credit.

[00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:36.380]
Let's not talk about it.

[00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:38.640]
Then at God I'll call back that was playing the quarters in Vegas.

[00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:42.160]
See, well, he doesn't understand and his foamy friend,

[00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:43.800]
the court yesterday, tried to get me all whipped up.

[00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:45.260]
You know, what is a fake indignation?

[00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:48.900]
Nobody cares about some schmuck out there this plan.

[00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:51.120]
I mean, you know, if you're a schlepper, of course,

[00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:52.980]
play the nickels, play the quarters, have a good time.

[00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:53.380]
That's all.

[00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:54.380]
But nobody cares.

[00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:55.060]
It's not interesting.

[00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:56.580]
If I'm like Woodbuyn,

[00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:57.060]
how'd they care?

[00:15:57.220 --> 00:15:57.680]
Because I'm legendary.

[00:15:57.940 --> 00:15:59.840]
See, there are no colors that are legendary.

[00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:00.960]
There's something that they're trying to be,

[00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:01.900]
but they'll never make it.

[00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:04.560]
So if I have a good day at Woodbuyn,

[00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:06.420]
or I find a bunch of bad machines,

[00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:07.800]
like, has to, they want to hear that.

[00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:09.520]
And I'm not going to go into great detail, you know?

[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:11.620]
It's like my late friend, the great fat rich

[00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:12.660]
with his racetrack story.

[00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:14.820]
So I had the one over the four by seven,

[00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:16.940]
the seven broken, the four ran into the grea,

[00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:18.420]
you know, nobody cares rich.

[00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:19.640]
I mean, he's a great guy, you know,

[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.640]
rest in peace, big peace.

[00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:24.400]
But nobody cares about those things.

[00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:26.580]
Okay, let's get back to Josh and me

[00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:27.540]
on the elevator there now.

[00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:30.600]
Well, I think it's an interesting story.

[00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:34.240]
I mean, it was kind of different.

[00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:36.760]
I mean, I give you credit for that.

[00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:38.100]
I mean, see, a lot of people,

[00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:38.860]
as you know, when I'm building,

[00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:40.800]
especially the people of Power 96 traditionally,

[00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:41.700]
right from the very beginning,

[00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:42.980]
we've been in there almost 10 years now.

[00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:43.300]
Right.

[00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:44.140]
Nine years plus.

[00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:45.200]
Very unfriendly.

[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:47.800]
Yeah, I'd say that.

[00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:48.760]
Yeah, that's right.

[00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:50.920]
The people of Power, like, they're on FM,

[00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:52.160]
and they're big, they, you know,

[00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:53.420]
they have a living and breathing audience,

[00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:54.320]
and they're talking to people

[00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:55.180]
under the age of 100.

[00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:56.400]
And we're just on AM.

[00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:58.140]
We're just a bunch of old croppers on AM.

[00:16:58.420 --> 00:16:59.460]
Even the law's probably making more

[00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:01.000]
than the whole day in Power 96 payroll.

[00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:02.360]
But what if it's a Zant-Make, you know?

[00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:04.520]
Now, that's, that's right.

[00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:05.200]
I believe that.

[00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:06.680]
I think that's probably true,

[00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:07.680]
as far as the only air talent.

[00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:11.120]
Well, they, one guy,

[00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:13.020]
could give you a run for your Zant.

[00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:15.300]
DJ Laz, but you think he's making the big bucks?

[00:17:15.580 --> 00:17:16.920]
I mean, I think he's pulling down, huh?

[00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:18.900]
I don't know if he's making as much as you.

[00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:20.480]
I'd say DJ Laz is doing just fine.

[00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:22.060]
No, give me a guess.

[00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:23.000]
What do you think he's making?

[00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:24.260]
If I were to guess,

[00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:26.000]
listen, let's lay it right out there on the table.

[00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:27.240]
Okay, you and me today, okay?

[00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:28.340]
Josh, my good buddy.

[00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:30.440]
Okay, that's personal friend who loves me like crazy.

[00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:33.120]
I would even want, I would guess,

[00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:34.940]
I guess he's pulling down around a mill.

[00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:36.580]
Get out of here.

[00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:38.640]
DJ Laz, you kidding me?

[00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:40.160]
Why do you say it like in those,

[00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:40.960]
in those days?

[00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:42.660]
He's doing, is he doing it really?

[00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:43.800]
Yes, he's legendary.

[00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:44.480]
He is legendary.

[00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:45.580]
Well, in my case, if you're a legendary,

[00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:46.840]
you should be making seven figures.

[00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:49.160]
So you can go to Woodbine and lose your ass.

[00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:51.260]
No, but the point I was trying to make about the elevator

[00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:53.140]
is that there are a lot of very unfriendly people,

[00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:54.580]
including, I remember one time,

[00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:56.660]
this is a story that really is still to this day,

[00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:58.700]
Frost My Ass, talk about the epitome of South Florida

[00:17:58.700 --> 00:17:59.440]
and what's wrong with it.

[00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:02.480]
I mean, we had been into building all that long

[00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:04.980]
and I get on the elevator to go home at the end of my show.

[00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:07.600]
And, you know, it's a short, what is it?

[00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:09.700]
15, 20 seconds going on, what is real quick?

[00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:09.700]

[00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:10.960]
On days when the elevator is working.

[00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:13.860]
And there's two young guys on there.

[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.200]
I mean, both ugly, so I wasn't all that interested.

[00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:17.580]
From what?

[00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:19.080]
I'm sorry.

[00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:19.340]
I'm sorry.

[00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:20.080]
Oh, sorry.

[00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:22.060]
I'd have paid attention, okay?

[00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:22.480]
Right, right.

[00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:23.500]
I was interested, but they were ugly.

[00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:25.620]
But then, they were speaking English

[00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:26.880]
when I got on the elevator, okay?

[00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:29.040]
They'd obviously gotten on it to go down just before I did.

[00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:31.300]
And they were speaking English just like you and I are right now.

[00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:33.280]
And all of a sudden, as soon as I got on the elevator

[00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:34.740]
to the door closed, it was like

[00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:36.200]
Bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap,

[00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:36.680]
and it's funnier.

[00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:39.420]
And I thought, and not only didn't they even acknowledge the fact

[00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:40.700]
that I was on there, a high meal,

[00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:42.940]
how you doing, or up yours, you faddle, fag, or whatever.

[00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:45.260]
But it was just rude, it's hell rude.

[00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:46.820]
Well, they wanted to talk bad about you.

[00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:48.120]
They must be in Dave County, huh?

[00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:49.540]
They wanted to talk bad about you

[00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:50.540]
without you knowing whether or not.

[00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:51.220]
They weren't talking.

[00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:52.560]
I was speaking to Pony, man.

[00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:53.260]
I'd be getting to Pony.

[00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:55.520]
I got the 10, 15 words down, you know.

[00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:57.300]
Uno of those traits like Scotty Mack.

[00:18:57.500 --> 00:18:58.020]
Uno of those traits.

[00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:01.040]
We can kill a whole show on this

[00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:02.060]
because we got a short show today,

[00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:04.740]
but I think it's interesting, the fact that you at least had

[00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:06.100]
the balls introduce yourself.

[00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:08.060]
I was a big fan, man.

[00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:10.660]
I'd say I'm a big fan, a big bond man.

[00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:11.960]
I'd tell you, I had like,

[00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:15.120]
tall myself off by the time I got down to the first floor.

[00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:15.500]
What?

[00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:17.460]
Made an impact like that?

[00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:18.060]
Huh?

[00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:19.280]
Made an impact like that?

[00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:20.960]
No, I mean, that kind of, no, no.

[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.000]
Don't start getting like that.

[00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:23.380]
Okay, don't start turning this into

[00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:24.580]
some kind of a sexual thing.

[00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:25.160]
I did not.

[00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:25.520]
You're a punk student.

[00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:26.700]
No, I'll have it.

[00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:28.880]
I believe, believe me, at my advanced age,

[00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:30.400]
you'd have to be somebody a hell of a lot more

[00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:32.140]
interesting than you would have an impact like that.

[00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:33.580]
Believe me when I tell you.

[00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:35.360]
No, I'm just saying it was just a nice,

[00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:36.280]
kissy, kissy job.

[00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:36.680]
That's all.

[00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:37.200]
There you go.

[00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:38.260]
Yeah, that was nice.

[00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:41.040]
And I thought to myself, do you want a nice kid, you know?

[00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:42.280]
And then of course, you want to

[00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:43.840]
work on the show and I realize well.

[00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:46.440]
WQA M Hello.

[00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:48.340]
Any kind of you'll be leaving early.

[00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:49.640]
WQA M Hello.

[00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:53.420]
See, we're picking right up where we left off yesterday

[00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:55.540]
with Reverend Jones and his entourage of misfits

[00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:56.500]
and lunatics and idiots.

[00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:58.480]
I'm not going to waste too much time with that today again.

[00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:00.220]
Fool me once, shame on us.

[00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:00.900]
QA M.

[00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:02.860]
Don't waste any time, baby.

[00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:04.080]
WQA M Hello.

[00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:07.560]
Hey, I'll be your host pressure for the

[00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:08.320]
toothless brigade.

[00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:09.280]
You think it's that one of the

[00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:11.220]
problems with Miami-Dade County?

[00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:11.900]
Yeah.

[00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:13.040]
Go away.

[00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:15.920]
Tony LaRusa, a manager of the World Champion

[00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:18.280]
St. Louis Cardinals, found himself sitting in the jail cell

[00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:19.860]
instead of a dugout this morning after a

[00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:21.320]
DIY rest overnight in Jupiter.

[00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:23.700]
Oh no, I knew he was out of this world.

[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.720]
Undercover, undercovered city officers discovered

[00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:28.620]
LaRusa, a slapered the wheel of his blue Ford SUV

[00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:29.760]
around midnight last night.

[00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:31.760]
Near the intersection of military trail and

[00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:34.640]
Frederick's small boulevard, the Palm Beach Post-Besan.

[00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:36.800]
The engine was running, the transmission was

[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:38.080]
in driving, his foot was on to break.

[00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:39.720]
Initially, he didn't respond to several

[00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:41.000]
wraps on the driver's side window.

[00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:41.980]
Finally, he was roused.

[00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:42.400]
Hey, Tony!

[00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:43.680]
Hey, you smart, you drunk!

[00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:45.940]
Finally, he was roused.

[00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:48.800]
LaRusa's 62 almost is old design for Christ's

[00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:49.780]
days. In other words, very old.

[00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:52.580]
Was determined to have a blood alcohol content of

[00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:55.440]
.093% Jupiter Police at the statement.

[00:20:55.780 --> 00:20:57.920]
Ford is legal driving limit as .08.

[00:20:59.220 --> 00:20:59.980]
And he was .09.

[00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:02.740]
He was booked in the Palm Beach County jail four hours later.

[00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:03.960]
The charges are a Mr. Meener.

[00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:07.360]
Members of the Cardinals were informed of the

[00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:08.660]
rest as they arrived at the stadium.

[00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:10.620]
Thursday for work, they expressed shock and

[00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:11.640]
support for their manager.

[00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:13.980]
He was one of the most acclaimed managers in

[00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:16.060]
baseball even before he managed the Cardinals

[00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:18.060]
victory in the 2006 World Series.

[00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:19.960]
I haven't heard anything said,

[00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:21.280]
Braden Lupert, former member of the

[00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:22.580]
Marlins, not pitching for the Cardinals.

[00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:24.080]
I just know the kind of person he is and

[00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:25.140]
how much respect I have for him.

[00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:26.320]
I'll respect him a ton.

[00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:27.540]
I'll stand by him.

[00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:30.380]
Oh, if we only had stand by me by Benny King right now.

[00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:32.120]
Which I know you do, but you know,

[00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:33.920]
you can't get into Georgia's goods there, can you?

[00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:34.740]
No, not really.

[00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:37.040]
I mean, I can't get into Georgia's goods.

[00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:40.200]
24 past 10, a QN.

[00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:41.520]
Here's the poll result from yesterday.

[00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:43.620]
Short show today with the Marlins

[00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:44.660]
in the Cardinals of 1250.

[00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:46.540]
I wonder if Tony will be back in the bench

[00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:47.500]
show for today's game.

[00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:47.720]
You think?

[00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:50.300]
Sure, with a bottle by his side.

[00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:51.340]
A bottle of Heineken.

[00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:54.060]
Got 845 votes out of the days,

[00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:55.020]
Paul already 1,000.

[00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:56.760]
Even with a short show today, 1,000 is a given.

[00:21:56.860 --> 00:21:57.520]
And you want to know why?

[00:21:57.740 --> 00:21:58.880]
Because this is the legendary.

[00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:00.160]
The Elijah Show.

[00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:01.640]
Not just the ordinary pedestrian show.

[00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:03.520]
Legend freaking dairy.

[00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:05.240]
Here's the poll.

[00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:06.780]
If I could be somebody else for one day,

[00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:09.340]
we had 1357 votes.

[00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:10.480]
They didn't like this poll.

[00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:12.020]
They didn't like it.

[00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:13.760]
And you know something when you come right down to it.

[00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:15.300]
They didn't like it because they don't get it.

[00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:16.640]
These people over at home saying,

[00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:18.320]
you have to be back in his prime.

[00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:19.960]
You know, what kind of a deal is that?

[00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:22.780]
That's like saying Abe Lincoln when he was present.

[00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:23.500]
You know, well, what is it?

[00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:25.020]
If I could be somebody else for one day,

[00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:27.360]
I would be whoever the hell we're talking about now,

[00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:28.800]
not 40 years ago.

[00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:30.880]
Well, he would have to still win, 331.

[00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:32.640]
Because with this crowd out there,

[00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:34.220]
all they want to do is get laid.

[00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:35.360]
You know, and I say,

[00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:36.060]
can you blame him?

[00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:38.000]
No, I agree with that.

[00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:40.280]
All this business about, you know,

[00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:41.740]
if you're going to go to school and learn something

[00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:43.140]
that will be helpful to you in your career

[00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:44.600]
and make you a lot of money and all that,

[00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:45.240]
that's great.

[00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:46.420]
Because then if you make some money,

[00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:47.600]
then you can get laid that much more.

[00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:48.920]
But other than that,

[00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:50.700]
there's not anything really all that relevant.

[00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:53.260]
That's a terrible thing to say on the air.

[00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:54.740]
There's young, impressionable people out there.

[00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:55.240]
Yeah, good.

[00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:56.520]
I hope they take the message from me.

[00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:58.260]
Okay, enjoy it and do it.

[00:22:58.340 --> 00:22:58.900]
That's my suggestion.

[00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:00.040]
Okay, do it a lot.

[00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:01.000]
Enjoy it even more.

[00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:02.280]
You have 1331.

[00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:03.120]
That's what that's all about.

[00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:04.720]
Not because he's a great looking guy

[00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:05.860]
or because he made a lot of money,

[00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:08.020]
but because they know what to deal with.

[00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:09.900]
I gotta be me, 304.

[00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:10.880]
Yeah, sure.

[00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:12.360]
Tiger Woods 145.

[00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:13.320]
Not because he's a golfer.

[00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:14.900]
And what that gol stuff with the rail this week.

[00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:17.260]
Oh, oh my god, talk about pain.

[00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:19.400]
But because he's married to a hot blonde chick.

[00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:19.840]
Isn't that right?

[00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:20.640]
Yes, he is.

[00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:23.780]
No, I'm not asking is that's why they want to be him.

[00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:26.260]
I hate this pool, 198 percent.

[00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:27.600]
I don't blame.

[00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:28.880]
Tom Brady 61.

[00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:30.800]
And not because Tom Brady is a great three

[00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:32.360]
at times Super Bowl champion quarterback

[00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:34.280]
or a great athlete or looks so damn good

[00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:35.900]
or all those other things because Tom Brady

[00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:37.520]
is impregnating every hot chicken in the world.

[00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:38.160]
He's busy.

[00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:39.660]
He's taken my advice.

[00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:41.880]
Okay, he's not wasting any time, baby.

[00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:44.360]
George W. Bush 53.

[00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:45.860]
And I'm not even touching that.

[00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:47.040]
Neil Rogers 52.

[00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:48.460]
So they could be a legendary fat old

[00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:50.380]
bag for a day or the queen for a day

[00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:51.880]
like that old TV show Jack Bailey.

[00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:52.740]
Queen for a day.

[00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:53.700]
It's not the same Jack Bailey

[00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:55.300]
that used to drive it Vernon down by the way.

[00:23:55.740 --> 00:23:56.580]
Bill Clinton 52.

[00:23:57.060 --> 00:23:58.460]
Howard Stern 50 by Edge.

[00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:00.220]
Howie Bill Gates 44.

[00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:01.840]
Anybody but who I am 35.

[00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:03.020]
Peter North 20.

[00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:04.340]
The old straight shooter Peter North.

[00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:05.240]
He's still got it.

[00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:07.100]
He can still bring it with the best of him.

[00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:08.040]
Wayne Heisenga 20.

[00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:09.400]
Ron Jeremy 14.

[00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:11.960]
Fat as they say in China, baby.

[00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:14.380]
Fat George Rodriguez 13.

[00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:15.860]
Shaquille O'Neill Shaquille.

[00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:17.740]
I'm not anybody else by that name to you.

[00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:18.240]
Shaquille.

[00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:19.620]
No, Shaq Scott 10.

[00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:20.320]
Paul Allen 10.

[00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:21.120]
Hillary Clinton 10.

[00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:23.260]
Oh, they like to be a real Bush broad

[00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:25.720]
with a thing.

[00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:27.300]
Sydney Crosby 9.

[00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:28.500]
Vanessa Peridice 9.

[00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:29.880]
Only because she's married to Johnny Depp.

[00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:30.880]
And then Johnny.

[00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:33.760]
And Brady Quinn, Solomon T.

[00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:36.080]
Says Get her giddy cocket.

[00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:06.500]
How about it, I'm gonna get cockin' up and young.

[00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:07.260]
Excellent.

[00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:09.440]
I'm obsessed with those sometimes.

[00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:10.900]
I think I've heard send me that disc

[00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:12.180]
that I've forgotten all about.

[00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:13.380]
You know, I got all these discs,

[00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:14.660]
all these CDs,

[00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:16.760]
and all this great stuff from the past is on there.

[00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:19.260]
You know, from the IOD days,

[00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:21.480]
which I'm sure Josh wasn't listening back to the IOD days.

[00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:22.780]
That's when I started listening to you.

[00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:23.800]
Really an IOD?

[00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:25.340]
Yeah, my dad listened to you.

[00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:27.620]
So I was in the car, I was listening.

[00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:28.700]
Well, thanks, Dan.

[00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:30.000]
That's good.

[00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:31.800]
And what about Chris?

[00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:33.180]
You weren't listening to the IOD days.

[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:35.260]
Not it was for those until you came over here.

[00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:39.020]
Because we had the lovely Anna Perez.

[00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:43.280]
Sometimes I feel like...

[00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:49.780]
Sometimes I feel that life is passing me by.

[00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:51.940]
I'm just gonna play these in the crime shames, I don't know.

[00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:52.200]
Not.

[00:25:52.860 --> 00:25:54.060]
Something to think about this.

[00:25:54.340 --> 00:26:00.500]
Sometimes I feel that people don't want to smile.

[00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:02.180]
Nice.

[00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:06.100]
Then I turn on my radio.

[00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:10.000]
It makes me smile like a child.

[00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:11.400]
Like a child, gotta say.

[00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:23.580]
We also have one with the Fart version too,

[00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:24.420]
that we can't play anymore.

[00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:25.060]
In fact, I probably do my thing.

[00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:25.640]
Oh, let's hear it.

[00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:27.640]
Because I can play it for now.

[00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:28.400]
You can dump it.

[00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:29.480]
All right, let's do it.

[00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:30.240]
Do you wanna do that?

[00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:30.440]
Yeah.

[00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:31.680]
Hey, I'm on the show today.

[00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:32.180]
Let's do it.

[00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:32.820]
I'll dump it.

[00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:35.120]
All right.

[00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:37.040]
But the audience is that it feels cheated.

[00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:38.540]
People on the internet all here.

[00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:39.840]
Oh, that's right.

[00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:42.400]
Sometimes I feel...

[00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:44.160]
Okay, that's as much.

[00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:45.240]
That was great.

[00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:46.840]
Oh, well, if you heard the whole thing,

[00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:47.580]
you'd really love it.

[00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:48.700]
You'd be in hysterics.

[00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:50.340]
You'd probably get any elevated with me again.

[00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:53.220]
You're okay, Josh.

[00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:53.780]
You're a good guy.

[00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:55.360]
But luckily for you, you're just not, you know.

[00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:56.200]
Not one of those really.

[00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:57.180]
In fact, the whole building,

[00:26:57.280 --> 00:26:58.560]
if it would have been JP now,

[00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:01.260]
and George keeps pretending he doesn't think

[00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:02.760]
that the kid ever worked in our station.

[00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:04.360]
It's a good thing George is out sick today.

[00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:06.120]
Maybe the Lord is punishing him for bad memory.

[00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:07.180]
God.

[00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:08.260]
One Pablo.

[00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:10.740]
That was about the only good looking guy

[00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:11.620]
we ever had in that building,

[00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:12.700]
which was working on a station.

[00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:13.520]
Is there anybody else?

[00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:13.720]
No.

[00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:14.640]
I'm not asking you guys.

[00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:15.160]
What do you know?

[00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:17.140]
That's always the response.

[00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:18.460]
So we wouldn't know, I know.

[00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:20.400]
879 votes out of this pool.

[00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:22.740]
We're gonna be 900 plus by the top of this hour,

[00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:23.940]
man, talk about power.

[00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:25.920]
So DJ Lazarus is making a million bucks.

[00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:28.320]
I'd say around there, yeah.

[00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:30.520]
You're just picking a number.

[00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:31.840]
You're picking that out of your butt, man.

[00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:33.280]
Like Mo used to pick the dingle bear.

[00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:34.660]
Is your picking that number out of your butt?

[00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:35.820]
Is that on your right now?

[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:36.320]
Right now.

[00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:37.300]
DJ Lazarus.

[00:27:37.420 --> 00:27:38.500]
Let's see, if you've got the buttons there,

[00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:40.000]
is it on the D-C on the 360?

[00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:40.920]
Like, I got it here.

[00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:41.640]
What?

[00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:42.780]
Backdome.

[00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:43.480]
Is it on there?

[00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:47.960]
See, Dr. Dome right away.

[00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:48.380]

[00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:48.900]
See there?

[00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:49.780]
Okay, that's it.

[00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:51.180]
Like real or memory ex, you know.

[00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:53.320]
I remember used to have those spots on TV with Elephant's Dirl.

[00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:55.180]
Is it real or is it memory ex, you know?

[00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:56.420]
Is it from Josh?

[00:27:56.740 --> 00:27:56.860]
Right.

[00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:57.740]
Dome or is it from Neil?

[00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:00.900]
I'm waiting.

[00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:02.800]
Backdome.

[00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:04.500]
Backdome.

[00:28:04.980 --> 00:28:05.380]
See that?

[00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:05.900]
Now, wait a minute.

[00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:06.580]
Was that Chris?

[00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:06.920]
Who?

[00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:08.540]
Where the hell did that come from?

[00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:09.340]
Okay, backdome.

[00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:09.620]

[00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:09.860]
Backdome.

[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:10.000]

[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:10.560]
That's where I think you're from.

[00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:11.060]
Where you stop?

[00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:13.420]
Okay, now let's get to this pool today.

[00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:13.840]
What do you, oh.

[00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:16.060]
And speaking of that, look what's leading on the pool today.

[00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:17.780]
This is great.

[00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:18.520]
Backdome.

[00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:19.820]
Where you stop?

[00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:22.180]
I think the audience is doing that.

[00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:24.340]
Where do people stop hitting that damn button for crying out loud?

[00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:25.220]
What is wrong with you?

[00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:27.900]
Man, I think they've got ass on there, my.

[00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:28.280]
Backdome.

[00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:29.940]
Hell, it damn near Kilmer.

[00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:30.700]
Okay, what do we got?

[00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:34.140]
We got 884 hosts for this is, I'm talking, man.

[00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:34.820]
This is the week.

[00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:35.900]
What did I say earlier in the week?

[00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:37.380]
Chris, and I said this is the week that, uh,

[00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:38.440]
to point in my life.

[00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:40.600]
Well, and by the way, speaking of that for my

[00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:43.160]
close personal friend out there who may have read

[00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:44.660]
some of the ramblings I wrote this morning,

[00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:46.060]
I know how to spell the P word.

[00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:47.980]
Okay, I just got probably got a little bit emotional

[00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:50.100]
for fear that I might actually think about one.

[00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:53.000]
But at any rate, you know, the P word I'm talking about.

[00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:54.460]
No, what do you say?

[00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:57.120]
It ends in Y, but I put I, I don't know why I did that.

[00:28:57.120 --> 00:28:57.800]
I N G.

[00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:03.120]
884 votes on a poll, which medical exam or procedure

[00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:06.000]
causes you the most anxiety he asked?

[00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:09.720]
Proctological exam, finger up the back of the...

[00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:11.280]
That does not mean that this poll is only as it was

[00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:12.960]
intended by the listener whoever it was.

[00:29:13.340 --> 00:29:14.420]
I wonder if that was Charlie B.

[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:15.700]
Yeah, it was Charlie B.

[00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:17.360]
Thanks, Charlie, by the way, you're the best.

[00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:19.580]
He sends in 80's and pulls every day.

[00:29:20.260 --> 00:29:21.680]
Proctological exam 302.

[00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:24.020]
Rube Canal, 132.

[00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:25.280]
Who, I never had one of those.

[00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:28.300]
That's why I'm in such a good mood this week.

[00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:29.500]
It's the first week in three weeks.

[00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:31.480]
I haven't had to go to the dentist and get the drilled

[00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:32.840]
and popped keyed around with all.

[00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:34.560]
You ain't got three weeks straight?

[00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:36.240]
No, two Mondays in a row.

[00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:37.960]
But this is the first week I didn't have to go.

[00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:40.100]
So I'm going to, even though I lost my ass,

[00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:41.820]
I'd much rather be losing my ass at WhipBind

[00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:42.940]
and then go back to the dentist again.

[00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:44.640]
Well, I would have great...

[00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:46.760]
Hate this poll 991.1%.

[00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:48.200]
Now that, that number is unacceptable

[00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:50.020]
because this poll is fine as GI1.

[00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:51.240]
It's not a damn thing wrong with it.

[00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:52.840]
Deadly exam 61.

[00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:55.140]
Tooth extraction 56.

[00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:56.100]
See how this is?

[00:29:56.220 --> 00:29:57.160]
Mostly dental crap.

[00:29:58.380 --> 00:29:59.920]
A bunch of whistles we got out there.

[00:30:00.540 --> 00:30:00.920]
Whistings.

[00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:02.780]
Giving a blood sample.

[00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:05.460]
Giving a blood sample 44.

[00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:06.840]
See, that's one thing I hate about.

[00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:08.720]
When you're instant messaging somebody,

[00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:11.640]
you can correct the spelling, right?

[00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:12.180]
Yes.

[00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:15.400]
In fact, what you can do, what I usually do,

[00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:17.940]
is I'll just re-check the word in the next line

[00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:19.420]
and so they know if I misspelled it,

[00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:20.820]
that I'm not that stupid, you know?

[00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:23.320]
But in my space, if you send somebody a message

[00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:27.100]
and you spell it like a name, you can't correct it.

[00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:29.080]
It's not really worth the effort to send another message.

[00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:31.860]
Oh, GI, misspelled that word, you know?

[00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:32.640]
What do you mean?

[00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:34.060]
They give you a proof of it.

[00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:35.660]
Like, this is what you wrote kind of thing.

[00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:37.140]
Oh, I'm not around having the time.

[00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:38.440]
Do you think I got the time in my life,

[00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:40.440]
the city, an important legendary guy like me,

[00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:41.820]
and rewrite...

[00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:42.660]
What do you write articles?

[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:43.620]
I mean, if that's the name.

[00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:44.340]
I'm writing...

[00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:46.020]
None of your business what I'm writing, okay?

[00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:47.940]
I'm writing a lot of perverted sex stuff

[00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:49.380]
is what I'm writing and that's what I'm getting back.

[00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:50.620]
Good stuff.

[00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:53.660]
Amusing stuff and in my case it is amusing.

[00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:55.860]
Dental cleaning 43, giving a stool sample...

[00:30:58.500 --> 00:30:59.220]
Sample 32.

[00:30:59.480 --> 00:30:59.720]
Welcome.

[00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:05.500]
You know, I could tell the story of my endoscopy

[00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:06.880]
and colonoscopy a few years ago.

[00:31:07.580 --> 00:31:08.680]
I think we'd all like that.

[00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:09.700]
Would you really?

[00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:10.100]
Yeah.

[00:31:10.340 --> 00:31:11.980]
Almost as good as the story about my graduate

[00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:14.400]
as you can see, but I told that one on here many, many times.

[00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:15.700]
You've heard that story, haven't you?

[00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:16.180]
Yes, I have.

[00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:16.840]
Okay.

[00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:18.580]
And now you got to admit that's a pretty good story.

[00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:20.620]
It's very good at any rate.

[00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:21.680]
It was...

[00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:22.600]
What else was I got to do?

[00:31:22.700 --> 00:31:24.120]
That was the only way I could protect myself

[00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:24.820]
was getting drunk.

[00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:26.100]
I mean, immediately I've not sooner.

[00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:28.420]
And poor Arlene, the girl that I took on that date,

[00:31:28.580 --> 00:31:30.240]
got her drunk as on it.

[00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:32.960]
The only thing I can remember about the actual being

[00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:33.940]
after in the woods is her.

[00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:36.200]
Remembering looking over every now and then she'd be

[00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:37.860]
finding a different spot, like like a dog.

[00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:39.160]
You know, I know how dogs knifes around.

[00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:41.300]
Different spots to squat and pee in the woods

[00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:42.440]
because we would drink it so much,

[00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:44.420]
mysterbrow, but at any rate.

[00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:47.760]
Giving a stool sample 32.

[00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:49.020]
I'll tell you that story about that.

[00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:50.140]
Well, that's not really a story.

[00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:51.560]
It's just a, you know, it's a thing.

[00:31:53.780 --> 00:31:55.580]
Because I was having I had the irritable bowel

[00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:57.320]
and I wanted to get my innards checked out.

[00:31:57.400 --> 00:31:58.100]
So I had the...

[00:31:58.100 --> 00:31:59.980]
I got checked out on both ends, you know?

[00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:01.580]
They put a...

[00:32:01.580 --> 00:32:01.920]
Chew!

[00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:03.040]
...down your throat and a...

[00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:03.380]
Chew!

[00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:04.080]
...the other end.

[00:32:04.580 --> 00:32:05.760]
Looking there and they look around

[00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:06.700]
and check everything out.

[00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:08.260]
She was being naughty and nice and stuff.

[00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:11.240]
Given...

[00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:12.140]
Saltajid's story.

[00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:13.600]
Stool sample 32.

[00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:14.080]
Routine.

[00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:15.740]
Medical check up 25.

[00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:17.420]
A...

[00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:19.000]
...genological exam 23.

[00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:20.140]
Treadmill test.

[00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:21.040]
22.

[00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:22.960]
I exam 13.

[00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:24.220]
Getting a shot.

[00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:24.620]
Eleven.

[00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:25.560]
Getting a shot, baby.

[00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:27.800]
Especially if it's dictated given a shot.

[00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:29.620]
Giving a urine sample.

[00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:31.980]
I know, why would anybody be upset about that?

[00:32:32.740 --> 00:32:33.780]
Well, maybe they do a lot of drugs.

[00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:34.980]
No, no, but seriously.

[00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:35.860]
Oh, I see.

[00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:37.680]
Well, look, what was the question again?

[00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:39.780]
Which medical exam will proceed your cause

[00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:40.300]
of the most anxiety?

[00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:41.000]
Oh, I see.

[00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:42.180]
Giving urine exam because they're afraid

[00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:43.800]
they're going to find out you're doing all them

[00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:45.360]
drugs, drugs, baby.

[00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:49.620]
Brest exam 8 and an EKG 7 out of 904.

[00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:50.900]
But we're going to be on the way to

[00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:51.940]
a thousand by the top of the hour.

[00:32:51.980 --> 00:32:53.540]
You want to know why that's cause Josh is here today.

[00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:54.440]
That's right.

[00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:56.380]
I think George is out and Josh is in.

[00:32:56.440 --> 00:32:57.020]
We don't think Chris.

[00:32:57.780 --> 00:32:58.020]
Sure.

[00:32:58.140 --> 00:32:58.320]
Quink.

[00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:00.180]
I'll text him and let him know.

[00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:02.600]
Now let me ask you this.

[00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:03.140]
Yes.

[00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:05.080]
Since you and I are so chummy these days,

[00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:07.720]
you know, the funny part of it is that

[00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:09.960]
well, of course I never was down there when you were working anyway.

[00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:10.960]
Because when I would come down,

[00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:11.900]
George would be running the board.

[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:12.860]
You'd be like somewhere else.

[00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:14.120]
You know, you'd come in and give me a kiss.

[00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:14.840]
That would be about it.

[00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:15.060]
Right.

[00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:17.540]
But who do you think is making more money?

[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:19.540]
George or you and your new position there now?

[00:33:19.660 --> 00:33:20.900]
I don't want to see what position it is.

[00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:22.360]
I don't think I'm there yet.

[00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:24.680]
I significantly increased.

[00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:25.760]
And I'm doing okay.

[00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:28.700]
Although I don't know what George makes.

[00:33:28.980 --> 00:33:29.720]
I don't even have a clue.

[00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:30.200]
Not much.

[00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:31.160]
Not enough.

[00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:31.840]
Not enough.

[00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:32.620]
He's an unsung hero.

[00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:32.960]
70.

[00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:35.240]
And I sure hope he's not listening home of a sick

[00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:37.620]
and thinking I'm ripping him while he's

[00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:38.540]
under the weather, you know.

[00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:40.780]
Cause you know what the audience will think.

[00:33:40.780 --> 00:33:41.340]
Oh yeah.

[00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:43.800]
Neil Wands says like Michael Jackson would have championed.

[00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:46.160]
He wants somebody younger and newer in there to take George's job.

[00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:47.380]
He's going to, yeah, I'm not going to.

[00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:48.740]
Well, do you think I would ever do that?

[00:33:48.980 --> 00:33:49.140]
No.

[00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:49.400]
Yeah.

[00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:52.040]
You know, Josh says no.

[00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:52.980]
Chris says yes.

[00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:53.560]
No.

[00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:55.180]
He's in your will for Christchurch, right?

[00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:56.200]
Who is George?

[00:33:56.620 --> 00:33:57.300]
Get out of here.

[00:33:57.400 --> 00:33:58.080]
Are you out of your mind?

[00:33:58.080 --> 00:33:59.260]
You said that, man.

[00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:00.020]
I will.

[00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:01.040]
Will my end.

[00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:01.960]
I told you that.

[00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:02.360]

[00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:03.140]
Rodgers,

[00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:04.940]
Force Radio 560.

[00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:06.340]
You A.M.

[00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:08.240]
A heart or a liver?

[00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:08.620]
No.

[00:34:11.980 --> 00:34:13.840]
This is the Z.A.C.

[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:14.520]
The News.

[00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:15.420]
Green,

[00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:18.020]
And then weather on Special Assignment Force.

[00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:19.320]
Z.A.S. Evening.

[00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:23.220]
Thanks to the Bush administration's bumbling of this

[00:34:23.220 --> 00:34:25.020]
come top bore in the Middle East.

[00:34:25.380 --> 00:34:26.200]
Motion Balance,

[00:34:26.660 --> 00:34:28.740]
Exploded again today in protest

[00:34:28.740 --> 00:34:29.820]
of the cartoon,

[00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:31.940]
Debiting the Profit Muhammad.

[00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:34.080]
Here in the one-scancule,

[00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:34.960]
tune down.

[00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:35.340]

[00:34:35.660 --> 00:34:35.880]
Come.

[00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:36.780]
Skip.

[00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:38.480]
You keep it down.

[00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:40.200]
Get the pig, get the pig,

[00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:40.920]
you run clean,

[00:34:41.180 --> 00:34:42.380]
and the other outcrap.

[00:34:43.180 --> 00:34:44.260]
Blame for the violence,

[00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:45.980]
rest squarely on

[00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:47.220]
Hamas Malah.

[00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:48.620]
And in Pakistan,

[00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:50.720]
a thawed is report free protesters

[00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:52.200]
were injured today

[00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:54.820]
when angels fell on their heads.

[00:34:55.020 --> 00:34:57.740]
The situation was compounded by the news

[00:34:57.740 --> 00:34:58.740]
from Tiran

[00:34:58.740 --> 00:35:01.620]
that Iran was producing its own

[00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:03.760]
Adam and F.A.R.

[00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:05.220]
reporting live from tune down

[00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:07.500]
and then rather severe speedy meat.

[00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:08.980]
Now, my team.

[00:35:10.060 --> 00:35:10.940]
Yeah, my best.

[00:35:11.140 --> 00:35:11.640]
I'll have both.

[00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:13.920]
Okay, 14 before 11 at 5.60 WQM,

[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:14.960]
two hours and four minutes away

[00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:16.380]
from the big Marlon pre-game show.

[00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:17.100]
All right.

[00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:18.360]
That's going to be really

[00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:18.900]
nice.

[00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:20.320]
You'll see for us anyway.

[00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:22.680]
So what's the story?

[00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:24.120]
Like at 12.50 you get to go home

[00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:25.540]
or you have to go back to your other job now.

[00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:28.420]
That's pretty funny.

[00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:29.360]
Uh, yeah.

[00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:30.580]
Well, that means pretty funny.

[00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:32.900]
Well, I, aren't you, aren't you

[00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:34.240]
being George for the day?

[00:35:34.660 --> 00:35:35.580]
I'm queen for the day.

[00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:36.620]
Aren't you being George for the day?

[00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:37.620]
Yeah, well, that doesn't mean

[00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:38.600]
that someone's handling my

[00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:40.100]
responsibilities right now.

[00:35:40.580 --> 00:35:42.020]
I see such as what

[00:35:42.020 --> 00:35:42.780]
would you be doing?

[00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:44.440]
Web work.

[00:35:46.060 --> 00:35:47.520]
But a wicked web we we.

[00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:48.020]
That's right.

[00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:48.660]
When we practice.

[00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:50.120]
Practice makes perfect.

[00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:52.180]
919 votes on the pool.

[00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:52.920]
By the way, we're going to have a

[00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:54.380]
thousand and four shades of

[00:35:54.380 --> 00:35:54.960]
a lame sale.

[00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:55.900]
Not too bad.

[00:35:57.620 --> 00:35:57.900]
And okay,

[00:35:57.960 --> 00:35:59.220]
all been out of shape now because we've

[00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:00.140]
got that stupid ASX

[00:36:00.140 --> 00:36:01.020]
edition ball game on.

[00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:02.140]
Okay, one of these days

[00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:02.800]
I'm going to start playing

[00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:03.520]
that's really going to count.

[00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:04.300]
There still won't be any

[00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:04.500]
interest.

[00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:05.260]
Oh, but nevertheless,

[00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:07.120]
by the way, I got it on a pretty

[00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:08.040]
good source that I called

[00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:09.960]
during the break that DJ

[00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:12.700]
lies not not just from the

[00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:14.280]
station, but he's involved in a

[00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:14.660]
lot of things.

[00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:15.500]
It is making it cool.

[00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:17.320]
Around a cool million dollars.

[00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:18.260]
Nice.

[00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:19.400]
Well, isn't that great?

[00:36:20.260 --> 00:36:21.320]
But not just in the station.

[00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:22.040]
Right.

[00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:23.740]
You know, his appearance is

[00:36:23.740 --> 00:36:25.140]
and stuff that he does on the

[00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:25.380]
side.

[00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:26.640]
I'm sure he's making

[00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:28.040]
about a hundred grand and he's

[00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:28.960]
making a hundred grand from.

[00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:30.380]
I'd say he's making a lot more

[00:36:30.380 --> 00:36:31.460]
than he's making a lot more than

[00:36:31.460 --> 00:36:31.860]
that boy.

[00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:33.240]
He must be I never heard of him

[00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:33.900]
to be honest with him.

[00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:34.820]
In the fact, I know he's in

[00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:36.000]
the building and he's been around

[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:36.760]
both the other.

[00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:37.820]
Any idea who I am?

[00:36:38.300 --> 00:36:38.940]
Of course.

[00:36:39.420 --> 00:36:40.180]
What do you mean by that?

[00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:40.920]
He works at power.

[00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:41.740]
They don't talk to us.

[00:36:41.740 --> 00:36:43.500]
They treat us like he's a radio

[00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:44.080]
guy.

[00:36:44.260 --> 00:36:44.880]
He's a legendary.

[00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:46.100]
He is a legendary

[00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:47.000]
during the larger than

[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:47.840]
yes, he does.

[00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:48.740]
He's probably over there,

[00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:50.240]
though, isn't he?

[00:36:50.420 --> 00:36:51.300]
How well how old are the guys

[00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:52.120]
this DJ last?

[00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:53.140]
He has probably about

[00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:54.480]
late 30s.

[00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:55.260]
I'm going 40 maybe?

[00:36:55.460 --> 00:36:55.640]
I don't know.

[00:36:56.460 --> 00:36:57.500]
That was the QAM.

[00:36:57.640 --> 00:36:58.320]
Hello, not there.

[00:36:58.420 --> 00:36:59.140]
That's a damn shame.

[00:36:59.140 --> 00:37:00.100]
That was going to be a good call.

[00:37:00.420 --> 00:37:01.380]
Oh, and that man he

[00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:01.760]
piece.

[00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:02.980]
Yeah, he did that

[00:37:02.980 --> 00:37:03.440]
with the adventurer.

[00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:06.120]
Well, that doesn't tell me anything.

[00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:06.900]
Adventurer, I'm all.

[00:37:07.620 --> 00:37:08.760]
Adventurer, those kids could be

[00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:11.100]
from Miami date or FIU or

[00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:12.820]
UM or from hunger.

[00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:13.380]
All of the above.

[00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:15.280]
Yeah, from all of those

[00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:16.760]
great institutions of

[00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:17.200]
air learning.

[00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:18.540]
B, they could be from

[00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:20.220]
dimension BCC even.

[00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:21.700]
Rower community college.

[00:37:23.060 --> 00:37:24.280]
Don't be putting down kids that

[00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:25.420]
went to BCC, okay?

[00:37:25.460 --> 00:37:26.260]
Just because they made

[00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:27.340]
you'd win surfing and stuff

[00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:27.660]
like that.

[00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:28.520]
There's nothing wrong with

[00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:28.900]
wind surfing.

[00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:29.400]
You ever tried?

[00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:30.260]
No.

[00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:31.440]
Well, if you're in Florida,

[00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:32.640]
it's one of those things

[00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:33.740]
that you do when you're in Florida.

[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:34.940]
Besides prepare to get

[00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:35.440]
to hell out.

[00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:36.420]
So how was that?

[00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:37.440]
How was what?

[00:37:37.580 --> 00:37:37.880]
When surfing?

[00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:38.180]
When surfing?

[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:39.740]
WDQA and hello.

[00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:41.800]
George would make more money.

[00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:43.180]
WDQA and hello.

[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:44.960]
Hey, Neil.

[00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:45.580]
Yes.

[00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:47.440]
I've been listening to you since

[00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:50.000]
the WIOC days.

[00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:52.940]
My boss turned me on to you.

[00:37:53.660 --> 00:37:54.100]
And I didn't know.

[00:37:54.100 --> 00:37:55.080]
Your boss turned me on, yeah?

[00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:58.660]
And DJ Live is pretty ugly.

[00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:00.620]
Fat guy with polio or something.

[00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:01.980]
He's got polio?

[00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:03.580]
He has polio.

[00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:05.740]
Something's on his leg or something.

[00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:06.060]
I don't know.

[00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:06.860]
Oh, no.

[00:38:07.060 --> 00:38:07.780]
Oh, my God.

[00:38:07.940 --> 00:38:09.300]
He's probably going to lift the limp.

[00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:10.680]
He's the Gimp or the limp.

[00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:11.440]
DJ Live's down.

[00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:12.680]
This guy just makes that up or is

[00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:13.060]
that the MS?

[00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:13.660]
Is that the truth?

[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:14.520]
No, he is.

[00:38:14.580 --> 00:38:16.100]
His moniker is the Pimp

[00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:16.860]
with the limp.

[00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:18.160]
He really does have a limp.

[00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:19.700]
Yes, I don't know if that's the

[00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:21.140]
actual reason behind it.

[00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:22.520]
Now, is that because he's got polio

[00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:23.080]
myelitis?

[00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:24.000]
No, I don't think so.

[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:24.960]
I thought Jonas Salk invented

[00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:25.960]
the polio vaccine.

[00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:26.980]
See, but I know something,

[00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:27.200]
then.

[00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:27.960]
And you know something?

[00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:29.580]
The fact that I know that Jonas Salk

[00:38:29.580 --> 00:38:30.700]
invented the polio vaccine

[00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:32.200]
isn't going to get me a lead

[00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:33.060]
or anything like that.

[00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:34.800]
So, yeah, if you know something

[00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:35.760]
and it's not going to be

[00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:37.140]
advantageous to your sex life,

[00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:38.180]
it's really rather useless.

[00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:39.380]
You know, or unless it's going to

[00:38:39.380 --> 00:38:40.180]
make you a lot more money,

[00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:41.040]
like here at QAM,

[00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:42.460]
we're running 80 billion spots

[00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:43.540]
in a morning show and we can't

[00:38:43.540 --> 00:38:44.220]
figure out what they can't

[00:38:44.220 --> 00:38:44.880]
crack a one share.

[00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:45.640]
You know, by the way,

[00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:47.600]
DJ Live's is 35-lil tool for you.

[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:51.660]
Oh, look at this.

[00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:52.800]
Somebody just faxed this in.

[00:38:52.860 --> 00:38:53.860]
We thanked him profusely.

[00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:55.560]
And the traffic checkpoint tomorrow.

[00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:56.760]
Do we want to, I guess I can

[00:38:56.760 --> 00:38:57.320]
mention it now.

[00:38:57.440 --> 00:38:57.500]
Yeah.

[00:38:57.640 --> 00:38:58.900]
Don't let me forget tomorrow

[00:38:58.900 --> 00:38:59.900]
because I know George is going to be

[00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:00.580]
out sick again tomorrow.

[00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:02.460]
I think, you know,

[00:39:02.580 --> 00:39:03.440]
how I work two days in the

[00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:03.680]
summertime.

[00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:04.400]
Yeah.

[00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:06.080]
See, because when you were on the

[00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:06.820]
other side of the glass,

[00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:07.860]
you were as useless as

[00:39:07.860 --> 00:39:09.820]
breast on a bullfrog, you know.

[00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:11.280]
But on this side, you do a good

[00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:11.520]
job.

[00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:12.280]
They think,

[00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:13.520]
Chris, he does a good job in here.

[00:39:13.860 --> 00:39:14.020]
Yep.

[00:39:14.660 --> 00:39:15.720]
In fact, when I got that message

[00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:16.900]
this morning that, um,

[00:39:17.340 --> 00:39:18.300]
George was going to be out sick

[00:39:18.300 --> 00:39:20.400]
today, I like, uh,

[00:39:20.860 --> 00:39:21.860]
I was getting myself.

[00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:23.560]
Not that I want George to be sick

[00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:24.780]
or I want him to feel bad, you know.

[00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:26.560]
But I just thought it

[00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:27.260]
gives us like a different

[00:39:27.260 --> 00:39:28.140]
different perspective.

[00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:29.240]
For example,

[00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:30.800]
somebody just raised a very

[00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:32.220]
interesting question about, uh,

[00:39:33.260 --> 00:39:33.900]
male prostitutes.

[00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:36.240]
And you have a lot of thinking

[00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:37.140]
what's interesting in that.

[00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:38.840]
Well, no, it is because it

[00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:39.960]
goes back to that BS and

[00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:41.120]
thank God George is in there today.

[00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:42.000]
So I have to fight all

[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:42.640]
the on this thing.

[00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:44.800]
If a young guy goes out like,

[00:39:44.860 --> 00:39:45.480]
like years ago,

[00:39:45.540 --> 00:39:46.320]
like I've folded these stories,

[00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:47.660]
I mean, what do I care at this

[00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:48.320]
point of my life?

[00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:49.980]
Uh, you know,

[00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:51.060]
guys used to pick up hookers

[00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:52.200]
on the boulevard and, uh,

[00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:53.600]
and queens like me used to

[00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:54.660]
pick up young guys who were

[00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:55.620]
hustlers on the boulevard.

[00:39:55.740 --> 00:39:56.540]
But many, many a time.

[00:39:56.760 --> 00:39:57.500]
There's nothing wrong with that.

[00:39:57.700 --> 00:39:58.620]
We did that poll one day.

[00:39:58.620 --> 00:40:00.280]
Almost, I wasn't about 50%

[00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:01.920]
Chris, 50% so they paid for sex.

[00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:03.040]
At least once in a lifetime.

[00:40:03.260 --> 00:40:03.560]
Yeah, right.

[00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:04.480]
So what's the big

[00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:05.120]
stimulus with that?

[00:40:06.140 --> 00:40:07.660]
So the fact that those guys

[00:40:07.660 --> 00:40:08.720]
are out there selling their

[00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:09.500]
body for sex,

[00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:10.500]
does that make them gay?

[00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:11.800]
By.

[00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:14.160]
By.

[00:40:15.620 --> 00:40:16.400]
By the hour.

[00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:18.320]
The minute gay.

[00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:21.620]
You're both full of crap.

[00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:23.060]
Makes makes them, uh,

[00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:24.140]
you know, it's, it's a living,

[00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:24.700]
most still,

[00:40:24.740 --> 00:40:25.420]
most still living,

[00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:26.000]
little lemon.

[00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:27.480]
As time and Roth would say.

[00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:29.100]
Well, I'm not going to open up

[00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:30.440]
that Pandora's box again.

[00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:31.000]
You know, it's just,

[00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:31.640]
what's the point?

[00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:33.580]
BSO deputies will conduct a

[00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:34.960]
traffic checkpoint on Friday,

[00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:36.040]
March 23rd.

[00:40:36.140 --> 00:40:36.900]
That sounds like tomorrow,

[00:40:36.900 --> 00:40:39.280]
boys and girls from 730 to 1030

[00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:40.520]
PM tomorrow night in the 26th

[00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:41.640]
hundred block of North

[00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:42.700]
West 49th Avenue,

[00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:43.580]
Lauderdale Lakes.

[00:40:43.660 --> 00:40:44.660]
If Tony LaRusse is listed,

[00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:46.280]
get Lauderdale Lakes tomorrow night.

[00:40:46.340 --> 00:40:46.900]
He'll be gone anyway.

[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:47.540]
Well, he's in Jupiter.

[00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:49.220]
Vehicles will be

[00:40:49.220 --> 00:40:50.360]
inspected for defective safety

[00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:51.280]
equipment motorists will be

[00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:52.380]
asked to show their drivers

[00:40:52.380 --> 00:40:52.800]
license,

[00:40:53.260 --> 00:40:53.640]
registration,

[00:40:53.940 --> 00:40:54.500]
proof of insurance,

[00:40:54.940 --> 00:40:55.600]
and give out a good,

[00:40:56.160 --> 00:40:57.480]
healthy breath like that.

[00:40:57.640 --> 00:40:58.800]
They're going to be asked to show it.

[00:40:58.900 --> 00:40:59.320]
Tomorrow night,

[00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:00.560]
730 to 1030,

[00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:01.880]
26th hundred block of

[00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:03.900]
Northwest 49th Avenue in Lauderdale

[00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:05.060]
Lakes, which isn't really very

[00:41:05.060 --> 00:41:05.760]
nice.

[00:41:06.140 --> 00:41:06.800]
But that's where it goes.

[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:07.120]
Yeah.

[00:41:08.220 --> 00:41:09.580]
Well, they keep doing that to us.

[00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:11.440]
932 votes on the pool.

[00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:13.880]
WQAM. Hello.

[00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:15.360]
Neil.

[00:41:16.060 --> 00:41:16.240]
Yes?

[00:41:16.820 --> 00:41:18.820]
Then Marlon Games got rained out.

[00:41:18.980 --> 00:41:20.360]
You've got to stay on till two o'clock.

[00:41:20.820 --> 00:41:21.360]
No, it's not.

[00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:22.900]
Yes, it is, Neil.

[00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:23.860]
No, it's not.

[00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:24.900]
Neil.

[00:41:24.900 --> 00:41:26.240]
Not no chance.

[00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:27.520]
If it's rained out,

[00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:28.520]
you're going to stay on it.

[00:41:28.620 --> 00:41:28.980]
Jupiter.

[00:41:29.260 --> 00:41:30.000]
It's not raining in Jupiter.

[00:41:30.180 --> 00:41:30.540]
Schmuck.

[00:41:31.020 --> 00:41:31.340]
Neil.

[00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:31.940]
You've shot.

[00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:32.520]
Neil.

[00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:32.960]
Neil.

[00:41:33.140 --> 00:41:33.140]

[00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:34.280]
Quizzling.

[00:41:34.420 --> 00:41:34.900]
It sounded like,

[00:41:35.060 --> 00:41:36.200]
that must have been Johnny G.

[00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:39.320]
Now, wouldn't we know if the

[00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:40.260]
Marlon Games was rained out?

[00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:41.220]
First of all, even if it is

[00:41:41.220 --> 00:41:41.540]
rained out,

[00:41:41.580 --> 00:41:42.300]
they come on here and don't

[00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:43.380]
they fill the time or something?

[00:41:43.620 --> 00:41:43.740]
Yep.

[00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:45.680]
Huh?

[00:41:45.940 --> 00:41:47.360]
They would do a rain delay special.

[00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:50.240]
Well, let's see.

[00:41:50.380 --> 00:41:50.980]
Jupiter weather.

[00:41:51.340 --> 00:41:52.060]
Now, is this going to give me

[00:41:52.060 --> 00:41:53.600]
the city or the planet?

[00:41:56.220 --> 00:41:56.620]
Huh?

[00:41:56.860 --> 00:41:57.500]
Let us know both.

[00:41:57.920 --> 00:41:58.200]
Okay.

[00:41:58.520 --> 00:41:59.080]
Well, let's see.

[00:41:59.260 --> 00:41:59.800]
Jupiter weather.

[00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:02.080]
The weather report is from Jupiter.

[00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:03.920]
Oh, that's about the planet.

[00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:07.200]
Jovey and super storms like those on

[00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:07.420]
Earth.

[00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:09.540]
Whether I, all these on here are

[00:42:09.540 --> 00:42:10.040]
on the planet.

[00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:11.820]
I better put the Jupiter Florida.

[00:42:12.820 --> 00:42:13.480]
It'd be good.

[00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:14.920]
Okay.

[00:42:15.340 --> 00:42:16.620]
I can just do the Florida weatherman.

[00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:19.700]
I could be the weather fairy for an hour.

[00:42:20.860 --> 00:42:21.420]
You fit right in.

[00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:21.680]
Jupiter.

[00:42:22.300 --> 00:42:22.640]
Florida.

[00:42:25.640 --> 00:42:26.000]
Okay.

[00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:26.340]
There we go.

[00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:27.140]
Jupiter Florida weather.

[00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:27.320]
Yeah.

[00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:27.920]
That's what I meant.

[00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:28.400]
Did you mean?

[00:42:28.620 --> 00:42:28.620]

[00:42:28.900 --> 00:42:30.040]
Oh, for crying out a lot of

[00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:30.480]
thunderstorm.

[00:42:31.060 --> 00:42:32.240]
I know it's been raining like

[00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:33.340]
cats and dogs down here.

[00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:34.080]
Let's see.

[00:42:34.180 --> 00:42:35.580]
Maybe this is the message I'm looking for.

[00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:38.920]
That says that guy was.

[00:42:40.220 --> 00:42:40.940]
Well, glad.

[00:42:41.180 --> 00:42:42.360]
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

[00:42:42.460 --> 00:42:42.600]
Good.

[00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:45.820]
You want to share there?

[00:42:46.060 --> 00:42:46.100]
What?

[00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:47.860]
Well, no, I don't, I don't share my

[00:42:47.860 --> 00:42:49.340]
personal inside messages here.

[00:42:49.460 --> 00:42:49.960]
I'll come over.

[00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:50.360]
I'll come over.

[00:42:50.620 --> 00:42:50.620]

[00:42:50.820 --> 00:42:50.880]
Okay.

[00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:51.120]
I'll come over.

[00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:51.640]
Okay.

[00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:53.100]
I don't, I don't share.

[00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:53.700]
It wasn't me using.

[00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:54.660]
I'm glad he got, he got

[00:42:54.660 --> 00:42:55.860]
tickled by it, but he gets sick of

[00:42:55.860 --> 00:42:56.140]
a lot.

[00:42:57.180 --> 00:42:58.200]
Easily from what I understand.

[00:42:58.580 --> 00:42:59.580]
Anyway, Jupiter forecast.

[00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:01.680]
It shows the thunderstorm,

[00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:02.880]
but 76 and 69.

[00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:03.940]
That doesn't tell me it's going to

[00:43:03.940 --> 00:43:04.580]
be rained out.

[00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:05.900]
You know.

[00:43:07.900 --> 00:43:10.260]
Hey, we're switching to the

[00:43:10.260 --> 00:43:11.320]
Paul game at 1250.

[00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:13.600]
Yeah, listen, I'm going to tell you

[00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:14.580]
about what I'm going to do.

[00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:15.300]
I'm just going to have lunch

[00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:15.620]
anyway.

[00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:16.400]
I'm not going anywhere.

[00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:17.200]
1250.

[00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:17.780]
What am I going to do?

[00:43:17.820 --> 00:43:18.460]
Am I going to go back to

[00:43:18.460 --> 00:43:19.160]
woodbind again today?

[00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:20.120]
I can wait till Saturday.

[00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:20.480]
Okay.

[00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:21.480]
Woodbind Saturday and lose my

[00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:22.020]
ass again.

[00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:24.880]
Oh, brother.

[00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:26.460]
This, I'm telling you, this week

[00:43:26.460 --> 00:43:27.780]
has been something.

[00:43:28.060 --> 00:43:28.980]
I can't, I can't use the word

[00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:29.420]
on the air.

[00:43:30.060 --> 00:43:30.620]
And you know why?

[00:43:30.740 --> 00:43:31.580]
I think it's because I found

[00:43:31.580 --> 00:43:32.980]
these old IOD things is what

[00:43:32.980 --> 00:43:33.420]
it is.

[00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:36.220]
Like this, this is another

[00:43:56.200 --> 00:43:56.660]
thing.

[00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:16.500]
Yeah, like that.

[00:44:16.500 --> 00:44:17.300]
Yeah, or something like that.

[00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:18.420]
We're approaching that

[00:44:18.420 --> 00:44:19.240]
thousand mark already.

[00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:20.280]
This is a banner day.

[00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:20.780]
Trust me.

[00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:22.260]
941 votes on the poll.

[00:44:22.620 --> 00:44:23.580]
And here's the deal.

[00:44:24.060 --> 00:44:25.100]
Which medical exam or

[00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:26.220]
procedure causes you the most

[00:44:26.220 --> 00:44:26.720]
anxiety?

[00:44:27.540 --> 00:44:28.340]
Proctological exam.

[00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:29.140]
We don't want to get too

[00:44:29.140 --> 00:44:29.820]
deeply into that.

[00:44:29.860 --> 00:44:29.980]
Right.

[00:44:30.140 --> 00:44:31.820]
Um, uh, 317.

[00:44:32.780 --> 00:44:34.180]
Group canal 142.

[00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:34.860]
I hate this poll.

[00:44:34.980 --> 00:44:36.760]
1008.11.4% is actually going

[00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:36.940]
up.

[00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:38.660]
What does it not like about this

[00:44:38.660 --> 00:44:38.860]
poll?

[00:44:38.980 --> 00:44:40.220]
I think it's most amusing if

[00:44:40.220 --> 00:44:40.660]
you ask me.

[00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:42.400]
Not as amusing as the guy with

[00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:43.400]
a wetter report, but an

[00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:43.740]
nonetheless.

[00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:45.520]
Devil Exam 63.

[00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:47.220]
Tooth extraction 59.

[00:44:47.620 --> 00:44:48.620]
Most of this is like, uh,

[00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:49.520]
tooth stuff, you know?

[00:44:50.540 --> 00:44:51.440]
We'd like to say who you

[00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:52.100]
must afraid of.

[00:44:52.180 --> 00:44:53.120]
Sandy Claus, the, uh,

[00:44:53.240 --> 00:44:54.360]
boogie man or the tooth fairy.

[00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:57.380]
Uh, getting a blood sample 49.

[00:44:57.600 --> 00:44:58.680]
Dettle cleaning 47.

[00:44:58.900 --> 00:45:00.680]
Getting a stool sample 32.

[00:45:01.060 --> 00:45:02.060]
Oh, I didn't tell you the story

[00:45:02.060 --> 00:45:02.580]
about my.

[00:45:02.660 --> 00:45:03.460]
I don't want to go into it.

[00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:04.200]
Oh, yeah, you do.

[00:45:04.340 --> 00:45:05.100]
No, I do not.

[00:45:05.220 --> 00:45:06.480]
It's too, it's too gross

[00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:07.580]
about that whole procedure.

[00:45:07.860 --> 00:45:08.200]
You got to go.

[00:45:08.260 --> 00:45:09.380]
Well, everybody wants to be

[00:45:09.380 --> 00:45:09.520]
ready.

[00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:10.560]
I'm not going into it too

[00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:10.880]
deeply.

[00:45:11.140 --> 00:45:12.120]
You'll just have to be on the

[00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:12.340]
teeth.

[00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:13.440]
Read it right around the edges.

[00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:14.800]
Yeah, I'll tease this.

[00:45:15.180 --> 00:45:16.740]
Routine medical checkup 27.

[00:45:17.240 --> 00:45:18.700]
A gyneological exam 24.

[00:45:18.700 --> 00:45:19.720]
Haven't had one of those yet.

[00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:21.560]
Treadmill test 23.

[00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:22.680]
I exam 13.

[00:45:22.900 --> 00:45:23.960]
What's the problem with that?

[00:45:24.060 --> 00:45:24.800]
I guess because your eyes

[00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:25.800]
do they dilate them, you know?

[00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:27.140]
They dilate your pupils.

[00:45:27.140 --> 00:45:28.160]
Kind of like with the priesthood

[00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:28.840]
of the altar boys.

[00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:29.940]
They dilate the pupils.

[00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:31.580]
Getting a shot 12.

[00:45:31.860 --> 00:45:33.180]
Giving a urine sample 10.

[00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:35.880]
Breast exam 8 and EKG

[00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:37.160]
Solomon, they see it there.

[00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:38.460]
What does the Neal Roger show?

[00:45:39.740 --> 00:45:41.280]
What solid is your brain?

[00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:44.240]
Any questions?

[00:45:48.700 --> 00:45:50.700]
I'll be right back.

[00:45:51.740 --> 00:45:53.600]
I'll be right back.

[00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:54.200]
I'll be right back.

[00:45:54.200 --> 00:45:56.180]
I'll be right back.

[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:00.400]
I'll be right back.

[00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:01.240]
4.

[00:46:02.020 --> 00:46:04.140]
One and Oscar 4.

[00:46:04.540 --> 00:46:07.140]
His two dead flick.

[00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:09.460]
4.

[00:46:10.220 --> 00:46:12.560]
All that saved the Earth's craft.

[00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:15.300]
It makes me sick.

[00:46:16.260 --> 00:46:17.440]
4.

[00:46:18.340 --> 00:46:20.760]
Everybody says that

[00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:21.600]
4.

[00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:23.180]
He's great.

[00:46:24.540 --> 00:46:25.480]
4.

[00:46:26.220 --> 00:46:28.700]
All I know is he should

[00:46:28.700 --> 00:46:29.240]
3.

[00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:31.200]
Some wait.

[00:46:32.700 --> 00:46:33.480]
4.

[00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:37.140]
Motion picture is a 4.

[00:46:38.100 --> 00:46:40.480]
All it did was make me

[00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:41.060]
4.

[00:46:41.780 --> 00:46:44.180]
With never ending warnings.

[00:46:44.900 --> 00:46:46.780]
Please beware of

[00:46:46.780 --> 00:46:48.600]
global warming,

[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:49.420]
God.

[00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:51.320]
Here's another

[00:46:51.320 --> 00:46:53.620]
and can be

[00:46:53.620 --> 00:46:55.340]
in truth.

[00:46:56.820 --> 00:46:59.300]
God should be fitted

[00:46:59.300 --> 00:47:02.080]
for a larger

[00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:03.240]
suit.

[00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:07.700]
God listening to him

[00:47:07.700 --> 00:47:09.020]
is a chore.

[00:47:10.300 --> 00:47:13.060]
That's much bigger than before.

[00:47:14.180 --> 00:47:16.380]
I do not like

[00:47:16.380 --> 00:47:17.160]
him.

[00:47:27.540 --> 00:47:29.500]
Okay, 1103 at 560.

[00:47:29.640 --> 00:47:30.540]
I'm going to look at if they

[00:47:30.540 --> 00:47:31.640]
floored a radar right now.

[00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:33.880]
Not that I want to be influenced

[00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:35.920]
by some quizzling that calls up

[00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:37.500]
with that squeaky fake voice.

[00:47:37.580 --> 00:47:38.340]
He was excellent though.

[00:47:38.340 --> 00:47:39.500]
I'm looking at the map and

[00:47:39.500 --> 00:47:40.220]
I see rain and south

[00:47:40.220 --> 00:47:40.460]
floor.

[00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:43.820]
I see some thunderstorms

[00:47:43.820 --> 00:47:44.560]
over Dave County.

[00:47:45.700 --> 00:47:47.000]
Jupiter is as clear as a bell.

[00:47:47.060 --> 00:47:48.560]
That's crystal queer in Jupiter.

[00:47:49.220 --> 00:47:49.220]

[00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:52.460]
Practice makes perfect baby.

[00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:53.500]
Have no fear.

[00:47:53.860 --> 00:47:55.000]
The marlins are here.

[00:47:55.180 --> 00:47:55.700]
With the red October

[00:47:56.280 --> 00:47:57.800]
and the bottle of booze with my

[00:47:57.800 --> 00:47:58.440]
master brows.

[00:47:58.720 --> 00:47:59.740]
Okay, well I'm ready for the story.

[00:48:01.080 --> 00:48:02.000]
For what story?

[00:48:02.180 --> 00:48:02.700]
Go ahead.

[00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:06.060]
How about my colonoscopy?

[00:48:06.300 --> 00:48:07.160]
I'm going to do it.

[00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:08.400]
It was the living end baby.

[00:48:09.380 --> 00:48:10.940]
They stick a tube down your throat

[00:48:10.940 --> 00:48:12.000]
and a tube tube.

[00:48:12.580 --> 00:48:14.940]
They knock you out first.

[00:48:15.120 --> 00:48:18.600]
They give you a shot.

[00:48:19.740 --> 00:48:20.880]
They give you the needle man.

[00:48:21.500 --> 00:48:22.340]
They don't put you completely

[00:48:22.340 --> 00:48:23.320]
under like if you're going to be

[00:48:23.320 --> 00:48:24.600]
operated like when I was a gallbladder.

[00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:26.460]
It's not that kind of a...

[00:48:27.620 --> 00:48:28.900]
I don't know what you would call it.

[00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:30.360]
It's an intermediate kind of anesthetic

[00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:31.820]
where you don't remember anything.

[00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:32.900]
And they give you a shot?

[00:48:34.300 --> 00:48:35.560]
How else are they going to put you out?

[00:48:35.740 --> 00:48:36.480]
Laughing gas?

[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:39.020]
What do you ask of such incredulity man?

[00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:40.760]
They give you a shot.

[00:48:41.140 --> 00:48:42.060]
They put you out.

[00:48:42.220 --> 00:48:42.300]
They put you out.

[00:48:42.300 --> 00:48:43.840]
They put you out.

[00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:49.300]
They give you a needle shot of some stuff

[00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:50.720]
and they know nothing.

[00:48:51.300 --> 00:48:53.260]
Which is probably not all that good, especially when you know

[00:48:53.260 --> 00:48:54.120]
where they're going to be examining.

[00:48:56.520 --> 00:48:58.680]
Probably better to be a little bit aware.

[00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:01.440]
And then you wake up and then the doctor is standing there

[00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:02.780]
which is this guy who's a very good guy.

[00:49:02.780 --> 00:49:03.860]
That was his area of expertise.

[00:49:05.100 --> 00:49:07.280]
And he tells you that he looked up there

[00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:09.220]
and down there and inside everything is just

[00:49:09.220 --> 00:49:11.140]
oh, we're fine.

[00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:13.460]
He's like a...

[00:49:13.460 --> 00:49:15.240]
a Hershey highway or something like that.

[00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:16.160]
Something cute.

[00:49:18.100 --> 00:49:19.180]
Instead of everything was fine.

[00:49:20.160 --> 00:49:22.440]
But the night before you have to do a little prep

[00:49:22.440 --> 00:49:24.420]
like show prep for like doing a show every day.

[00:49:24.540 --> 00:49:26.180]
You have to do a little bit of prep when you're going to go in there

[00:49:26.180 --> 00:49:27.460]
and get the old canals man.

[00:49:27.700 --> 00:49:27.960]
That's right.

[00:49:28.220 --> 00:49:31.040]
The eerie canal and the barge canal and the well-in canal

[00:49:31.040 --> 00:49:32.580]
for all you Ontario people.

[00:49:32.940 --> 00:49:33.900]
Let's go to the well-in canal.

[00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:36.340]
I don't know what we're going to do there.

[00:49:36.420 --> 00:49:37.380]
Well, let's go to the well-in canal.

[00:49:39.220 --> 00:49:40.600]
And so you have to provide.

[00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:42.140]
Well, they do these other tests too.

[00:49:42.140 --> 00:49:43.680]
I forget what they call it.

[00:49:43.860 --> 00:49:46.280]
They test for a certain kind of bacteria

[00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:47.480]
in your intestinal frang.

[00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:49.740]
What?

[00:49:49.980 --> 00:49:52.640]
Well, the reason I got concerned about that is that my grandfather...

[00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:54.520]
I mean, the audience doesn't care about all this.

[00:49:54.820 --> 00:49:57.780]
My grandfather on my father on my mother's side,

[00:49:58.400 --> 00:49:59.200]
Abraham Solomon.

[00:49:59.440 --> 00:50:00.220]
He died before I was born.

[00:50:00.600 --> 00:50:01.520]
He died of stomach cancer.

[00:50:03.240 --> 00:50:06.400]
And so I'm assuming, because what do I know about all those different genetic things?

[00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:09.300]
So I'm assuming that if I were to cope from something like that,

[00:50:09.500 --> 00:50:10.300]
that could be it.

[00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:14.680]
So the irritable bowel, you get these pains in the side.

[00:50:14.860 --> 00:50:16.220]
You think, oh, geez, I'm going to croak.

[00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:18.300]
And so it's probably going to go to the end of the day.

[00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:19.140]
Go to have it checked out.

[00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:25.240]
So the night before you have to do the prep, you have to do a real good internal cleansing.

[00:50:25.660 --> 00:50:26.400]
What do they call that?

[00:50:26.500 --> 00:50:29.440]
Like a blueberry explosive animal or something like that.

[00:50:30.300 --> 00:50:32.120]
And then also to check for this bacteria,

[00:50:32.280 --> 00:50:33.580]
which I can't think of what they call it,

[00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:36.220]
you have to provide stool samples.

[00:50:37.100 --> 00:50:40.600]
Just little swabs, swabs, swabs.

[00:50:41.860 --> 00:50:43.720]
And you have to...

[00:50:43.720 --> 00:50:45.020]
I'm not going to go into it.

[00:50:45.180 --> 00:50:45.980]
Okay, we can't do that.

[00:50:46.060 --> 00:50:47.420]
That's like too heavy duty.

[00:50:47.720 --> 00:50:49.580]
It's just a two-grow test.

[00:50:50.860 --> 00:50:52.120]
So you have to smear and smear.

[00:50:52.300 --> 00:50:55.200]
And then you have to put in these little bottles and close it all up.

[00:50:55.320 --> 00:50:56.600]
And then you have to shake it up too.

[00:50:57.140 --> 00:50:57.860]
Shake it up, baby.

[00:50:58.100 --> 00:50:59.300]
Yeah, look what's inside there.

[00:50:59.420 --> 00:51:00.980]
Oh, God, look what's in that bottle.

[00:51:02.420 --> 00:51:03.420]
So that's what you have to do.

[00:51:04.360 --> 00:51:07.480]
Some day, you know, all you people out there, all you punk's man,

[00:51:07.600 --> 00:51:08.740]
you think it's only us old-farts.

[00:51:08.860 --> 00:51:11.920]
Well, guess what? Some day if you're lucky, you're going to wind up being an old-fart too.

[00:51:12.060 --> 00:51:12.440]
Uh-huh.

[00:51:13.940 --> 00:51:18.340]
And then you're going to have to wind up doing the colonoscopy and the endoscopy and all these...

[00:51:18.340 --> 00:51:18.500]
Shoot!

[00:51:18.840 --> 00:51:21.400]
...with every kind of place where you wouldn't even want to imagine, you know?

[00:51:22.120 --> 00:51:23.120]
And you're like in coherent.

[00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:25.520]
You have no idea what kind of probing is going on there.

[00:51:25.660 --> 00:51:27.960]
You have no clue who's doing it and what they're doing.

[00:51:28.380 --> 00:51:29.320]
And probably just as well.

[00:51:30.520 --> 00:51:31.160]
Speaking of...

[00:51:31.160 --> 00:51:31.460]
Shoot!

[00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:33.640]
The mystery creator of the Orwellian U.

[00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:33.980]
Shoot!

[00:51:34.220 --> 00:51:41.260]
...ad against Hillary Rodham Clinton as a Democratic operative who worked for a digital consulting firm with ties to rival Senator Barack Obama.

[00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:41.940]
That's not good.

[00:51:42.760 --> 00:51:47.620]
Philip DeVelisay, strategist with Blue State Digital, acknowledged in an interview with the AP that he was the creator of the video,

[00:51:47.940 --> 00:51:52.420]
which portrayed Clinton as a big brother figure and earned support for Obama's presidential campaign.

[00:51:53.780 --> 00:51:59.620]
DeVelis-33 said he resigned from the firm yesterday after he learned that he was about to be en masse by the HuffingtonPost.com,

[00:51:59.620 --> 00:52:01.520]
a liberal news and opinion internet site.

[00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:09.160]
Blue State decided Obama's website on one of the firm's founding members Joe Rosper is took the lead from the company to work as Obama's director of new media.

[00:52:09.660 --> 00:52:17.260]
The connection to the campaign is likely to be a setback at his for Obama, who has cultivated images of politician who wants to rise above Bare-Nuckle politics.

[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:18.520]
Bare-Nuckle.

[00:52:18.860 --> 00:52:26.320]
It's true, yet to me, DeVelisay last night, he stated to produce the ad outside of work and that neither Blue State nor the Obama campaign was aware of his role in the ad.

[00:52:26.320 --> 00:52:27.440]
He said, what a schmuck, what an idiot.

[00:52:28.140 --> 00:52:29.560]
Sounds like sabotage you to me.

[00:52:30.760 --> 00:52:34.000]
But it raises some eyebrows so I thought, at best, I resign, not put them in that position.

[00:52:34.160 --> 00:52:38.140]
He said, Thomas Gensmer, director of Blue State Digital, said the Vellis was fired and ended.

[00:52:38.900 --> 00:52:43.340]
Mr. Vellis created this video on his own time against the Vellisay and it was done without the knowledge of management,

[00:52:43.640 --> 00:52:48.240]
and was in no way tied to his work and deferment of our formal engagement on technology for suits with the Obama campaign.

[00:52:49.440 --> 00:52:54.080]
In its own statement, the Obama campaign said the campaign had no knowledge and had nothing to do with the creation of the ad.

[00:52:54.080 --> 00:52:59.240]
Blue State Digital is separated ties with this individual. We've been assured he had no work on our campaigns account.

[00:52:59.540 --> 00:53:01.080]
The Clinton campaign had no me to comment.

[00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:05.180]
In the interview later in a blog written for the Hopping and Post-Devils Express,

[00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:08.880]
Pride and his creation, acknowledging that his employers are disappointed and angry at me and deserve it,

[00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:11.940]
so it changes the trajectory of my career, he said.

[00:53:12.380 --> 00:53:16.300]
In posting his blog, he wrote, I support Senator Obama. I hope he wins the primary.

[00:53:16.820 --> 00:53:18.940]
I recognize that this ad is not a style of politics.

[00:53:18.940 --> 00:53:24.540]
Also, I believe Senator Clinton is a great public servant and if she should win the nomination, I would support her to wish her all the best.

[00:53:25.240 --> 00:53:25.620]
Wow.

[00:53:26.520 --> 00:53:29.340]
The 74 second clip, which I'm sure you've both seen it, right?

[00:53:29.940 --> 00:53:32.120]
No. I've seen most of it.

[00:53:32.580 --> 00:53:39.120]
A copy of an 84-apilette for Macintosh computers recorded nearly 1.5 million views with an enormous surge in the past few days.

[00:53:39.660 --> 00:53:44.600]
Two days, the video's final image reads Barackobamma.com, which has no business being on there.

[00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:48.280]
Developers remain hidden for weeks protected by the anonymity afforded by you.

[00:53:48.800 --> 00:53:52.080]
Chew! And the absence of federal regulations governing most internet political speech.

[00:53:52.440 --> 00:53:57.040]
The ad portrait, Clinton, on a huge TV screen addressing robotic humans in a stark futuristic call.

[00:53:57.500 --> 00:54:01.280]
A female athlete tosses a hammer at the screen, destroying Clinton's image with an explosive flash.

[00:54:01.700 --> 00:54:08.060]
Then this text, on January 14th, that Democratic primary will begin and you'll see why 2008 isn't going to be like 1984.

[00:54:09.620 --> 00:54:13.600]
Developers said he used footage of an updated appilette that portrayed the female athlete wearing an iPod.

[00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:17.500]
He said he used standard appilette equipment to modify the video, edit Clinton's image into the clip.

[00:54:18.580 --> 00:54:23.320]
Obama, appearing on Larry King Live Monday night, said his campaign knew nothing about the origins of the anti-clinton ad.

[00:54:23.680 --> 00:54:27.180]
Frankly, given what this looks like, we don't have the technical capacity to create something like this.

[00:54:27.280 --> 00:54:28.420]
He said it's pretty extraordinary.

[00:54:29.380 --> 00:54:35.840]
Developers said he's an Obama supporter, was inspired to do the ad after he read reports that Clinton backers were strong arming Democrats for money and support.

[00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:40.600]
He added, I didn't really like the style of some senator Clinton's videos, and the way they were presenting her on the internet,

[00:54:40.600 --> 00:54:47.080]
I just thought it was a little bit this ingenuous, just like her, this infreaking genuine set of fish, the ice princess, Hillary.

[00:54:48.440 --> 00:54:51.840]
But nevertheless, this is kind of interesting.

[00:54:52.060 --> 00:54:55.120]
It's not really just a poll that somebody sent in pretty boring with, come right down to it.

[00:54:56.220 --> 00:54:57.040]
So I think, it's alright.

[00:54:57.980 --> 00:54:58.380]
Oh, I see.

[00:54:58.920 --> 00:55:03.680]
If the Neil Roger show was yanked off the air between 10 and 2, I would blank.

[00:55:03.880 --> 00:55:09.540]
And it's got a listen to Rush, listen to Saddler Radio, listen to 790, the ticket, listen to FM, listen to the very best of Neil CDs.

[00:55:10.460 --> 00:55:12.520]
Watch TV or throw myself off a tall building.

[00:55:12.840 --> 00:55:16.820]
Well, I think that's what most people would do is that last choice, throw themselves off, well, maybe not a tall building.

[00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:21.560]
Because I told you before, that's not a good way to do it, because they may be halfway down to change your mind.

[00:55:21.720 --> 00:55:23.700]
Too late, too late, sorry, mister.

[00:55:24.340 --> 00:55:24.960]
Can't do it.

[00:55:25.860 --> 00:55:26.720]
Not a good way to go.

[00:55:26.940 --> 00:55:28.240]
Pull it through the brain as a way to do it, then.

[00:55:29.480 --> 00:55:30.000]
What do you think?

[00:55:30.560 --> 00:55:31.340]
That's what I hear, yeah.

[00:55:31.720 --> 00:55:31.820]
Yeah.

[00:55:33.920 --> 00:55:35.560]
Anyway, let's take a look what we got here.

[00:55:35.560 --> 00:55:39.220]
9.78 after the break, we're going to have like a thousand votes.

[00:55:39.800 --> 00:55:42.860]
Probably because Josh Corners is there today, and that guy out there that's got the hots for you.

[00:55:42.940 --> 00:55:44.380]
He wants you badly, man.

[00:55:47.120 --> 00:55:49.820]
There are no words to describe how much he wants you.

[00:55:49.880 --> 00:55:54.740]
He wants to faddle you and cuddle you and put you in a corner and tie you up in a chair and just keep you there.

[00:55:55.060 --> 00:55:55.160]
Yeah.

[00:55:55.880 --> 00:55:57.820]
Just as a friend, this is a companion.

[00:56:00.020 --> 00:56:01.000]
Just to hang out.

[00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:03.360]
Which, I'm not going to read this again.

[00:56:03.500 --> 00:56:04.760]
I just got through reading these of disgusting.

[00:56:05.440 --> 00:56:09.160]
981 votes, especially that thing about the what's the one I keep getting to where I can.

[00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:12.660]
Giving a stool stamp, and I keep thinking back to that whole deal with that.

[00:56:13.020 --> 00:56:13.240]
Shoot!

[00:56:15.140 --> 00:56:18.600]
Well, you know, if there were a god, you think we'd be going through things like that if there was really a god.

[00:56:18.700 --> 00:56:22.840]
All you religious notes out there, all you get to is stop and ask yourself that question, okay?

[00:56:23.700 --> 00:56:28.440]
If there was a god, will we have these horrible things that we have to be involved in?

[00:56:28.440 --> 00:56:29.180]
No, I'm clean.

[00:56:29.640 --> 00:56:30.280]
I'm clean.

[00:56:30.800 --> 00:56:31.500]
Oh, god.

[00:56:32.580 --> 00:56:33.140]
You know what I mean?

[00:56:34.280 --> 00:56:35.940]
I wonder if I'll burtow you a five-gain zombie.

[00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:38.340]
We have a situation with Billy on the stage.

[00:56:38.500 --> 00:56:39.640]
It's not like he's in a room closet.

[00:56:39.820 --> 00:56:40.460]
Good place for us.

[00:56:40.560 --> 00:56:40.840]
In the fire.

[00:56:41.140 --> 00:56:42.520]
In the fire, United States of attorneys.

[00:56:43.180 --> 00:56:43.900]
Get out of here.

[00:56:44.020 --> 00:56:45.560]
You'll lie in a little piece of turd, man.

[00:56:46.560 --> 00:56:46.860]
New.

[00:56:47.780 --> 00:56:48.520]
Yeah!

[00:56:53.660 --> 00:56:57.680]
Three goals a time my brain is wet.

[00:56:59.560 --> 00:57:03.020]
I'm what they call the 25th person.

[00:57:04.460 --> 00:57:06.900]
Now there's push administration.

[00:57:07.480 --> 00:57:09.400]
Those must be as bold.

[00:57:10.360 --> 00:57:13.380]
And everything I see about you.

[00:57:13.380 --> 00:57:20.920]
And everything I feel I believe you know me when you said me.

[00:57:21.340 --> 00:57:26.480]
But you know with the fact that all my ass is you, baby.

[00:57:27.140 --> 00:57:30.820]
I support the truth and of them.

[00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:37.700]
And believe that China together, like that all my ass is you, baby.

[00:57:38.700 --> 00:57:40.660]
ink

[00:57:46.660 --> 00:57:48.700]
あぁ

[00:58:03.700 --> 00:58:04.700]
あぁ

[00:58:07.700 --> 00:58:10.880]
George Ibn, that's alright, I've been

[00:58:11.700 --> 00:58:14.540]
No all of them can come, let the gun it does

[00:58:14.540 --> 00:58:20.820]
Shower over the heat, I've got a yellow magnet on my head

[00:58:20.820 --> 00:58:24.440]
My head's newbie

[00:58:25.940 --> 00:58:28.720]
I've been all of them going to be so good with their whining

[00:58:28.720 --> 00:58:31.540]
Keep them going, because I've got so much rush, each fine tube

[00:58:31.540 --> 00:58:34.160]
Set them all back in the battle, go with them, and out their lips

[00:58:34.160 --> 00:58:37.380]
We have that, and that is another thing, we've got a fight over there

[00:58:37.380 --> 00:58:40.860]
So say, come over here, get her done, for check my squad

[00:58:41.720 --> 00:58:44.820]
Get her done, baby, it's 11, 18, and 5, 60, and nobody can do that

[00:58:44.820 --> 00:58:46.840]
This is quite a story we have here about the provost

[00:58:46.840 --> 00:58:48.760]
I don't even know what, what does a provost do?

[00:58:49.440 --> 00:58:51.960]
I remember a club provost used to play with a Montreal Canadiens

[00:58:51.960 --> 00:58:53.160]
Let's do some hockey taught

[00:58:53.160 --> 00:58:53.900]
You're fairy

[00:58:54.700 --> 00:58:56.980]
What does a provost do at a university, do you have any idea?

[00:58:57.340 --> 00:58:58.120]
I don't

[00:58:58.120 --> 00:59:00.060]
Well why don't you, uh, Google it right now

[00:59:00.060 --> 00:59:02.340]
P-R-O-V-O-S-T, provost

[00:59:02.340 --> 00:59:03.880]
Oh really, is that how you spell it?

[00:59:04.860 --> 00:59:07.120]
Well you've got the article there, you factored to me didn't you?

[00:59:07.880 --> 00:59:08.220]
No I didn't

[00:59:08.220 --> 00:59:11.120]
No, no, that's right, this is a Chris factored before you came in this morning

[00:59:12.580 --> 00:59:14.860]
It says the sudden and unexpected departure

[00:59:14.860 --> 00:59:16.860]
Senior academic administrator, by the way

[00:59:16.860 --> 00:59:19.600]
Well excuse me, that sounds pretty hoydin-toy to me, huh?

[00:59:21.180 --> 00:59:24.620]
The sudden unexpected departure popular of a Montreal University provost

[00:59:24.620 --> 00:59:27.860]
Ah, Vemla Ria, let's play it by Johnny Mathis, come on we can do it

[00:59:27.860 --> 00:59:30.640]
Ah, let's get one for the Getski's baby, it's almost Easter time

[00:59:30.640 --> 00:59:31.480]
And Pace Off

[00:59:32.660 --> 00:59:36.320]
See all new people out there that don't understand what a bunch of garbage all religion stuff is

[00:59:36.320 --> 00:59:38.400]
Have you ever noticed, it's not just a coincidence, okay?

[00:59:38.480 --> 00:59:39.340]
Because it's all about business

[00:59:40.360 --> 00:59:43.160]
Of course, the Jews in the Goyom, they have to have the major holidays

[00:59:43.160 --> 00:59:46.080]
There has to be some like, uh, cross-dress, cross-over like

[00:59:46.080 --> 00:59:48.700]
So Easter time you've got Passover, Pace Off

[00:59:48.700 --> 00:59:50.980]
And then the Christmas time you've got Chanooka, Hanukkah

[00:59:50.980 --> 00:59:54.540]
And it's an interesting, how Hanukkah and Christmas both involve the giving of gifts

[00:59:54.540 --> 00:59:57.540]
Spending of lots and lots and lots of money, huh?

[00:59:58.160 --> 00:59:58.560]
Anyway

[00:59:59.260 --> 01:00:03.780]
The sudden unexpected departure popular of Avingri University provost John Fessio yesterday

[01:00:03.780 --> 01:00:06.880]
Let's students and faculty stunned and upset

[01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:08.600]
Oh, this is from NaplesNews.com

[01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:11.760]
That's where that big Avingri is in Naples where they have a great steak and shake out here

[01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:13.660]
And it's not the Sonic, Sonic, yeah

[01:00:13.660 --> 01:00:15.800]
Excuse me, now, are you a Sonic guy?

[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.680]
Oh, I'm a huge shot, well when I was in Tampa last time I hit it

[01:00:19.340 --> 01:00:21.860]
You hit it? I hit it, did you get it?

[01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:23.640]
Oh yeah, I bet you did, yeah

[01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:25.580]
So how was it? I love it

[01:00:26.100 --> 01:00:27.220]
How about the electronic?

[01:00:27.220 --> 01:00:31.080]
No, it's great man, it's open 24 hours, you just pull up people, bring it to the food

[01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:33.780]
I've got it so good about it, they've got great burgers that aren't like how I'll fall in their partner

[01:00:33.780 --> 01:00:38.360]
I don't know nothing about the burgers, I just know that I got a little breakfast burrito that was fantastic

[01:00:39.180 --> 01:00:43.100]
And they got awesome like little icies, like lemonade icies

[01:00:43.100 --> 01:00:44.760]
Not icies, that sounds so...

[01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:46.880]
Yeah, Jesus, Josh, come on

[01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:50.520]
Oh sorry, I'm giving all these compliments into everything, I'm trying to boost your career here

[01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:53.460]
Like icies, that sounds so...

[01:00:53.460 --> 01:00:54.480]
Jesus, anyway

[01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:59.220]
Getting back to office and what about, I hear the desserts are fantastic there too

[01:00:59.220 --> 01:01:03.820]
I've never been anywhere near a Sonic, I wouldn't know if one would bite me on a lift, we don't have that here

[01:01:03.820 --> 01:01:05.980]
We got Harvey's

[01:01:07.580 --> 01:01:08.960]
And in Tampa they got Hardies

[01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:14.720]
See, that's the thing I don't understand, why does Tampa have so much better restaurants than Dayton Rower

[01:01:15.460 --> 01:01:16.360]
Well, why is that?

[01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:18.240]
The old people like to go to restaurants a lot more?

[01:01:18.740 --> 01:01:22.300]
No, it's not nothing to do with old people, the old people go through fast food, that's...

[01:01:22.300 --> 01:01:24.840]
When you go through the fast food joints over there, you'll see old people

[01:01:25.940 --> 01:01:30.800]
You see a young retard who eventually will be old, probably like someday, but they're young retard

[01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:34.060]
That's one thing, man, the inbreeding on a West Coast authority is just unbelievable

[01:01:34.060 --> 01:01:37.680]
It must have, it must have like, slapped down from finessey and our can saw

[01:01:38.300 --> 01:01:41.200]
And Mississippi and Alabama, through all the Miyahu places

[01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:44.640]
It must have kind of slapped down through the inbreeding like one upon a West Coast authority

[01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:47.920]
God, so many orange-haired, strange people

[01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:53.580]
But they got Sonic and they got Steak and Shake way before Steak and Shake ever came to South Florida

[01:01:53.580 --> 01:01:55.040]
For years and years and years

[01:01:55.040 --> 01:01:59.100]
And the good thing about the ones in Tampa, the Steak and Shake, like that one famous one on Dale Maybury

[01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:04.040]
Is that the burgers don't all fall apart in like little chunks, like they do with certain ones

[01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:07.280]
I don't want to say the Steak and Shake on sunrise, but the burgers are really good

[01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:10.840]
And the shakes, oh man, I get the shakes just thinking about it

[01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:13.580]
So you would give Sonic what? On a scale of ten?

[01:02:14.620 --> 01:02:21.900]
I mean, you know, granted it's fast food, but you know, I would give it a, for fast food, I'd give it a good eight or nine

[01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:22.840]
Hmm

[01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:26.660]
Josh Cordes is an eight or maybe even a nine for Sonic

[01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:27.520]
I like

[01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:31.000]
You like? I like Sonic

[01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:32.280]
Nice

[01:02:32.740 --> 01:02:37.240]
These sudden unexpected departure popular of Amory University provost John Fessio

[01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:41.660]
Yes, they left students in faculty, stoned up, said Fessio wants a student of the current Pope

[01:02:41.660 --> 01:02:44.900]
Oh my God, was asked to resign as position immediately yesterday

[01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:50.240]
Fessio sent an email shortly after 2pm when they were members of the Aval Maria community

[01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:52.160]
Not seeing his departure, the brief email read

[01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:55.580]
To the Aval Maria University community, I mean the Aval Maria

[01:02:55.580 --> 01:03:00.520]
I've been asked to resign, my position is provost, leave the campus immediately, get out of here, you lunatic

[01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:06.620]
I will miss Aval Maria, Aval Maria, and the many of you who know I hold dear, aha, I hold dear

[01:03:06.620 --> 01:03:09.400]
I wonder if there's a comma in that

[01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:13.360]
In a statement, University officials said Fessio was asked to sit down, I wonder if he's came to Tessio

[01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:18.520]
It was asked to step down as a result of irreconcilable differences over administrative policies and practices

[01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:21.400]
Practice makes perfect, you know, the statement is not elaborate

[01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:26.220]
University officials would like Fessio to serve the University and advise me capacity in the future according to the statement

[01:03:27.060 --> 01:03:31.740]
We are grateful for the last paragraph that this makes the rest of it worthwhile, so just bear with me

[01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:33.620]
It's coming in a few hours

[01:03:33.620 --> 01:03:37.640]
We're grateful for the enormous contributions Father Fessio has made to the development of Aval Maria University

[01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:41.720]
Especially to the liturgical and intellectual development of the institution, the statement read

[01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:44.920]
The liturgical and intellectual development of the institution, Laptured?

[01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:50.840]
Laptured, yeah, Laptured as in Brem, it's the turd time I've told you, cut the crap

[01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:56.220]
University president Nick Helian School Fondertown Monahan met with students and faculty in progress

[01:03:56.220 --> 01:03:59.740]
They regarding Fessio's dismissal, according to Barbara Leonard University's spokeswoman

[01:03:59.740 --> 01:04:02.280]
Neither Helian or Monahan could be reached later for comment

[01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:05.480]
Fessio also could not be reached, people don't get asked to resign, they get fired

[01:04:05.480 --> 01:04:10.220]
Said Reverend Michael Beers, Dina, they pre-theologic pro, a Theologate, I don't know how you say that

[01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:17.540]
Pre-theologate program? No, get out of here, Adave Maria, I was very surprised I'm totally shocked Beers said

[01:04:17.540 --> 01:04:19.320]
They don't get resigned, they get fired

[01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:22.380]
Now here comes the interesting part, the me of the matter

[01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:29.060]
Fessio's dismissal came one day after recent statements he made were published in article in the California Catholic Daily titled

[01:04:29.060 --> 01:04:32.340]
Hey, hey, baby gay, what do you do, what do you say?

[01:04:34.660 --> 01:04:39.720]
This is in the California Catholic Daily, this isn't in some like screaming, fag, paper or something

[01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:45.080]
In the California Catholic Daily, the article was titled, hey, hey, baby gay, what do you do, what do you say?

[01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:50.200]
What do you say, sweetie? His statement's also published March 2 on the personal website

[01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:55.200]
One of the country's pre-eminent evangelist leaders, the Reverend A. Albert, Molar, Jr.

[01:04:55.200 --> 01:05:00.740]
In the article, Molar suggested that there was a possibility that a biological basis for homosexuality may be proven

[01:05:00.740 --> 01:05:04.300]
The Associated Press reported, Molar's argument was endorsed by Fessio

[01:05:04.300 --> 01:05:10.280]
Well, that's it, that's it, now he's coming to the aiding and abetting them Fagote's, that's what he's doing, that's why he's out

[01:05:10.980 --> 01:05:15.240]
Hey, hey, baby gay, what do you do, what do you say? I think it's who do you do and what do you say, huh?

[01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:18.580]
And what do they say? What do they say, father?

[01:05:18.660 --> 01:05:22.660]
Oh, right, a big fag placement, I hope Catholic Church says all it is

[01:05:23.060 --> 01:05:27.120]
And that whole confession idea, do you know those priests, man, when they're sitting on the side of that confessional,

[01:05:27.220 --> 01:05:32.060]
and they want to ask you about all of that personal stuff, and did you touch it, did you do it, did you do this one,

[01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:35.800]
who did you touch, and where did you touch them, and how was it, and how many times did you do it?

[01:05:35.980 --> 01:05:42.140]
They're sitting in their man, they got the big Catholic Jura Vaseline on the other side of that confessional, you know it, man

[01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:45.760]
And you better get there a lot of their fast, because God only knows where they're going to put it

[01:05:46.260 --> 01:05:48.820]
Don't play that dropper, oh, geez, I knew you'd do it

[01:05:49.420 --> 01:05:55.900]
I did it. See, the audience has no idea, that was good yesterday, we got a thousand two votes already, oh, man, what a week

[01:05:55.900 --> 01:06:01.560]
On a short and a show, because of the Freakin Marlin game, and we still got a thousand two votes already

[01:06:02.020 --> 01:06:02.640]
WQYM, hello

[01:06:03.900 --> 01:06:04.480]
You know

[01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:12.020]
I must be missing something because apparently support the troops means keep them in harm's way

[01:06:12.020 --> 01:06:14.680]
Yeah, yeah, okay, right, yeah, like we don't know that already

[01:06:14.680 --> 01:06:22.600]
Quick try to be like an intellectual, yeah, big bullet in there from this guy, like support the troops just a bunch of double talk crap

[01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:26.980]
To try to intimidate everybody else, especially Democrats who are easily intimidated these days

[01:06:26.980 --> 01:06:31.720]
Oh, John, in those of you that have a news conference at noon about her health and about whether he's running or not, I'm sure

[01:06:31.720 --> 01:06:36.560]
Or maybe he just won't say anything like that goofball, who was it? Chuck Hagel, remember that press conference, Chris?

[01:06:36.820 --> 01:06:37.540]
Yes, it was

[01:06:37.540 --> 01:06:41.840]
We waited, we waited, we waited, Ponderous, Ponderous is an understatement man

[01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:44.900]
A thousand and two votes on the legendary poll

[01:06:44.900 --> 01:06:47.160]
Sorry to credit union, he's got Neil

[01:06:47.660 --> 01:06:48.720]
How'd you like that, huh?

[01:06:49.020 --> 01:06:52.960]
John Flair, on the taxi, kind of, I said, drive him central pile

[01:06:53.900 --> 01:06:58.160]
He looked at me so quissically, I could tell he was in the dark

[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:04.900]
So I acted out my puncture rate, and with my arms the trees I made

[01:07:04.900 --> 01:07:08.140]
There's no bug, he speaks English and then my owner

[01:07:08.140 --> 01:07:10.140]
Okay, like...

[01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:15.960]
I went down to my room and I made breached where the weather business and sunny

[01:07:17.140 --> 01:07:21.260]
I walked into a liquor store, but a guy there talks real funny

[01:07:22.140 --> 01:07:27.020]
I asked him for a pint of fortune beamies as naughty and the what doesn't mean

[01:07:27.020 --> 01:07:30.600]
The butter's put English and I'm all

[01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:34.320]
That cornered Delhi, huh?

[01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:38.920]
Hell, I think I'm in Pakistan, speaking with some mail-in

[01:07:39.620 --> 01:07:42.160]
Are you thinkin' go back to the law, right?

[01:07:50.060 --> 01:07:54.740]
I came here many years ago, learned my ABC

[01:07:55.320 --> 01:08:00.180]
I don't say much is grossiest, I say pretty much

[01:08:00.820 --> 01:08:05.920]
So get yourself to a classroom quick here in America now, stop making mistakes

[01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:08.160]
Put your butt out, it's gonna be English

[01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:09.100]
Come in more!

[01:08:12.060 --> 01:08:15.460]
32Q, I said the point I was trying to make is that there's like Donna Tellos which who knows her

[01:08:15.460 --> 01:08:19.440]
I mean, I haven't been intampinating a long time in a coons age as they sit on the pool last Friday

[01:08:19.440 --> 01:08:23.400]
I mean, I wouldn't say there's better restaurants in Thurin's Steakhouse

[01:08:24.540 --> 01:08:25.260]
Bern's Steakhouse

[01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:27.240]
Legendary?

[01:08:28.020 --> 01:08:28.880]
You know he's dead

[01:08:29.700 --> 01:08:30.820]
And Donna Tellos?

[01:08:30.940 --> 01:08:34.020]
No, they're just saying in all the fast food joints, there's hardies, are there hardies?

[01:08:34.020 --> 01:08:37.860]
There may be like, are we gonna go through this again like we did with Sonic last week?

[01:08:37.980 --> 01:08:39.580]
Is there a hardies in South Florida left?

[01:08:39.760 --> 01:08:40.920]
No, I think they used to, there's not?

[01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:42.260]
No, not even one?

[01:08:42.640 --> 01:08:43.300]
No, I'll think so, no

[01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:45.500]
Not even the Soliment de Uno?

[01:08:46.320 --> 01:08:46.640]
No

[01:08:47.400 --> 01:08:50.780]
Oh, what a shame, hardies is good, they got them good shroom burgers, oh man

[01:08:52.180 --> 01:08:55.000]
No, don't tell me you eat those biscuits, that's where Goyam man

[01:08:55.460 --> 01:08:58.940]
No, biscuits with gravy, those things that are like a...

[01:08:58.940 --> 01:09:01.040]
No, no, no, biscuits are like, really?

[01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:03.800]
A gentrified forest man, well what are you talking about for their breakfast?

[01:09:04.060 --> 01:09:06.960]
They got like eggs, you know, they're just like McDonald's, they're better

[01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:07.340]
Yeah

[01:09:07.740 --> 01:09:11.260]
Now what is the burger, burger king's got those egg, uh, croissant witches

[01:09:11.260 --> 01:09:13.280]
Mick Mick sandwich, Mick, what is it?

[01:09:13.900 --> 01:09:15.000]
A croissant, a croissant

[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:16.880]
Oh, croissant, that's what they got

[01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:18.900]
Croissant, that's why I used to eat it in the eye and zero the time

[01:09:19.380 --> 01:09:22.360]
Without the egg, hold the egg please, squeeze the egg

[01:09:22.360 --> 01:09:28.320]
Well like just bacon, bacon and cheese, croissant, which with the egg, yeah, what who needs the egg on it?

[01:09:28.500 --> 01:09:32.480]
See I like eggs in an omelette, but any other kind of egg like, oh, oh man

[01:09:34.740 --> 01:09:38.400]
Wow, especially those runny ones, I mean, look, you think it's food but it's not

[01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:42.400]
God, you know I'm talking about runny eggs?

[01:09:43.080 --> 01:09:45.040]
Uh, no, I'm trying not to imagine that right now

[01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:47.220]
Well, it's like sushi, man, it's the same thing

[01:09:47.220 --> 01:09:49.820]
No, I mean there are people who eat it but I don't know why, you know

[01:09:49.820 --> 01:09:52.540]
Maybe because they think that they're smarter than me or something like that

[01:09:52.540 --> 01:09:57.280]
I mean sushi, no seriously, there is not enough money in the world to give me to eat sushi, I'm telling you right now

[01:09:57.280 --> 01:09:59.100]
I couldn't do it

[01:09:59.540 --> 01:10:01.900]
If anybody wants to pay me to eat sushi, I'll tell you

[01:10:01.900 --> 01:10:06.180]
There are a few things in the world that I would not put my tongue near and one of them is sushi

[01:10:06.180 --> 01:10:10.040]
Well, I agree with you to a certain extent, I mean I don't eat any raw sushi

[01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:16.400]
Yeah, I'll eat like, you know, California rolls which is just crab and you know cucumber

[01:10:16.860 --> 01:10:18.540]
Or a shrimp or a cucumber?

[01:10:18.780 --> 01:10:21.020]
Well, what does that mean? What's that kind of thing? I thought sushi had fish

[01:10:21.020 --> 01:10:24.860]
Well, you know, some of it's not, you know, some of it's cooked or like a lobster roll

[01:10:24.860 --> 01:10:26.980]
I'll eat stuff like that, I won't eat like the raw fish

[01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:29.340]
Oh, you know, or anything like that

[01:10:29.340 --> 01:10:31.820]
Oh, oh, oh, the pain

[01:10:32.500 --> 01:10:33.140]
WQAM, hello

[01:10:33.900 --> 01:10:35.140]
Hey, Neil, love you, man

[01:10:35.140 --> 01:10:35.900]
Yes, sir

[01:10:35.900 --> 01:10:40.660]
Hey, I gotta tell you, is there any way you can work past 1250 today?

[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:42.240]
Those games are getting fond of us

[01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:45.860]
No, we're out of here, 1250, Rainer's shine, baby, we're gone, we're out of here

[01:10:45.860 --> 01:10:47.120]
See ya, bye-bye!

[01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:49.560]
Like, Jasmine Kate would say, see ya, buddy!

[01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:54.120]
Not that I'm going anywhere, in fact, I'm gonna make me an omelette at 1250

[01:10:54.940 --> 01:10:59.500]
We got some eggs yesterday, for use in my GT Express omelette maker

[01:10:59.500 --> 01:11:01.240]
I ate an omelette this morning from Howe's

[01:11:01.240 --> 01:11:02.840]
Well, you know what that was?

[01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:04.000]
Nice!

[01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:05.560]
WQAM, hello

[01:11:06.140 --> 01:11:07.200]
Hey, Neil, how are you doing?

[01:11:07.460 --> 01:11:08.860]
And it was free, too, that was really nice

[01:11:08.860 --> 01:11:10.060]
Great, how you doing, sir?

[01:11:10.360 --> 01:11:14.380]
I'm alright, I've never heard of cooked sushi, but anyway

[01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:17.940]
I thought sushi was raw fish

[01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:19.200]
Period, that's what I'm thinking

[01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:23.020]
No, they have, like, they look like shrimp and poro

[01:11:23.020 --> 01:11:26.320]
They put up your eye, shrimp and anything where the eyes looking back at you

[01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:28.280]
Oh, what had I said, I'm sorry

[01:11:28.280 --> 01:11:31.420]
This is Fort Lauderdale has just come up to the modern age

[01:11:31.420 --> 01:11:33.080]
We got a crystal in Fort Lauderdale

[01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:34.960]
Alright, where is it?

[01:11:35.220 --> 01:11:37.620]
That's right, Boulevard downtown, Farley Road, 9%

[01:11:37.620 --> 01:11:40.580]
That's been there, that's actually the only crystal down here

[01:11:40.580 --> 01:11:42.440]
I thought it was color line in this sunrise

[01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:45.360]
Not that I know, the only one I know is that one

[01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:46.260]
I passed the burn mistake

[01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:49.280]
Trust me when I tell you there's one of the power line in sunrise

[01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:51.740]
Guaranteed, but Josh's life on it

[01:11:51.740 --> 01:11:53.180]
There you go, alright, I get it

[01:11:53.180 --> 01:11:54.820]
Okay, I'll see you there, Colin, crystal

[01:11:54.820 --> 01:11:57.280]
I mean, not that crystal is anything all that special, but it's

[01:11:57.280 --> 01:12:00.020]
You know, it's one of those little greasy burger joints

[01:12:00.020 --> 01:12:02.900]
Which show you've got to have those to be like a real place, you know?

[01:12:03.100 --> 01:12:03.880]
You just got to have that

[01:12:03.880 --> 01:12:04.200]
Right

[01:12:04.860 --> 01:12:08.300]
We had top-hat hamburgers and we had greens in Detroit, we had those places

[01:12:08.300 --> 01:12:11.220]
If you had a bad night at the track at Hazel Park and you were all depressed

[01:12:11.220 --> 01:12:14.540]
On the way back to like Kalamazoo, where I was working at the time

[01:12:14.540 --> 01:12:18.220]
On the way back to Kalamazoo, you'd stop at top-hat and you go to the drive through

[01:12:18.220 --> 01:12:21.900]
And you open up the truck and say, fill her off baby with all greasy little burgers, man

[01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:25.780]
And little cheeseburgers with all the little nasty onions on them

[01:12:25.780 --> 01:12:28.420]
And you're hopefully were really onions and not like moving around at all

[01:12:28.420 --> 01:12:29.540]
Good stuff

[01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:31.520]
WQAM, hello

[01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:34.120]
QAM

[01:12:35.500 --> 01:12:36.060]
Not there

[01:12:36.060 --> 01:12:36.980]
QAM, hello

[01:12:36.980 --> 01:12:38.440]
How do you go to the drive trip?

[01:12:39.380 --> 01:12:39.680]
Hola

[01:12:39.680 --> 01:12:39.740]
Hola

[01:12:39.740 --> 01:12:40.680]
Hello

[01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:41.540]
Yes sir

[01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:44.080]
Powerline is 9000U

[01:12:44.680 --> 01:12:46.040]
It's the same thing Niel

[01:12:46.680 --> 01:12:47.020]
Okay

[01:12:47.680 --> 01:12:50.860]
That's a crystal, so let's get to the bread and butter of the batter

[01:12:50.860 --> 01:12:52.820]
And talk about prostitution

[01:12:53.680 --> 01:12:53.920]
Yeah

[01:12:53.920 --> 01:12:55.880]
How 71 years old

[01:12:55.880 --> 01:12:56.240]
Yes

[01:12:57.540 --> 01:13:02.440]
Did you ever frequent a tip-tock lounge?

[01:13:02.940 --> 01:13:05.200]
Never heard of it even, did I mention it was frequent?

[01:13:05.200 --> 01:13:10.260]
Oh wow, I used to tell you a girl named Lucy, she was a dancer there

[01:13:10.260 --> 01:13:11.300]
Lucy, yeah

[01:13:11.300 --> 01:13:16.140]
And she, she used to give me what they call now at April

[01:13:16.140 --> 01:13:20.220]
Okay good, great, I thought he was going to say something else

[01:13:21.580 --> 01:13:25.040]
But nevertheless, well we have to nip him in the bodies a little bit whipped up about

[01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:28.900]
Lucy, I love Lucy, something like that, that's what the Cathy Willets always said

[01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:31.540]
1020 on the poor, 1020 vote

[01:13:32.840 --> 01:13:36.600]
This business about prostitution is illegal and smoking pot is illegal

[01:13:36.600 --> 01:13:37.920]
And having a good time is illegal

[01:13:37.920 --> 01:13:41.560]
And anything that you might, pretty soon they're going to make like a banana splitter legal too

[01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:44.660]
You know, or the lickety split, whatever it is they're going to make it illegal

[01:13:44.660 --> 01:13:45.120]
You'll see

[01:13:46.900 --> 01:13:48.800]
Because that's America, that's America in a way

[01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:52.860]
And of course that's the peasant of onti of the churches, they sit in the godfather

[01:13:52.860 --> 01:13:54.480]
The peasant of onti of the church

[01:13:55.780 --> 01:13:56.980]
They want to do it themselves

[01:13:56.980 --> 01:14:00.360]
And especially if it's like underage and especially if it's like altar boys

[01:14:00.360 --> 01:14:02.340]
They want to have a real good hanky spanky time

[01:14:02.340 --> 01:14:03.960]
But anybody else wants to have a good time

[01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:06.920]
Oh you're going to burn the hell, you have to come and confess to father

[01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:10.460]
Tool and sit in there with his gigantic economy size, they're a vassalino

[01:14:10.460 --> 01:14:13.440]
Okay, give me a break, okay, any of you people are going to confession

[01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:15.960]
You need help, you need mental help

[01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:20.080]
I think what you ought to do is the next time you go all you Catholics out there

[01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:23.140]
If you're still participating in such a lunacy, go in there and say hey father

[01:14:23.140 --> 01:14:24.440]
Who did you do this weekend, huh?

[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.720]
How many little altar boys did you offer this weekend father?

[01:14:28.340 --> 01:14:31.560]
Let's get to the meat of the matter, you old pervert, you old thagota

[01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:35.000]
Am I right? Now let's see, are you Catholic? Yeah, you got out of that too John

[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:36.020]
I am Catholic, yes

[01:14:36.020 --> 01:14:39.900]
I mean I never bought into the BS, but I went to those schools

[01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:42.180]
You went to Catholic school, huh?

[01:14:42.360 --> 01:14:43.580]
I went to Catholic, and you have like an end-cruiner

[01:14:43.580 --> 01:14:44.520]
You have like an end-cruiner, altar is a boy?

[01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:45.760]
And yeah, a Catholic and what?

[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:46.760]
End Christian school

[01:14:48.180 --> 01:14:50.060]
Boy, and you survived that? Yeah

[01:14:50.060 --> 01:14:50.500]
Yeah

[01:14:50.500 --> 01:14:53.800]
Wow, heavy duty, how low you let's share for dry squirters

[01:14:53.800 --> 01:14:55.520]
No wonder he's a good guy, he's like Catholic school

[01:14:55.520 --> 01:14:58.780]
And Christian school, born again Christian school, I'm sure no doubt

[01:14:58.780 --> 01:15:01.360]
Oh sure, kosher? Well that's good

[01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:02.440]
How loud

[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:04.880]
Oh look at that big line of thunderstorms

[01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:07.200]
I bet the game's gonna be canceled, the only problem is that's up in Michigan

[01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:09.160]
And so on a way here too, as a matter of fact

[01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:13.700]
55 degrees for a height today, and there's Rob Marciano looking really, really good

[01:15:13.700 --> 01:15:15.380]
Rob, take the clothes off sweetheart

[01:15:15.380 --> 01:15:18.960]
Let's have some naked weather on the ACNN, get an audience for once

[01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:21.040]
Get somebody under the age of 100 to tune in

[01:15:22.780 --> 01:15:27.040]
1223 votes on the pool, I guess I can read it, you know, I'm a little reluctant because it's got too much

[01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:29.500]
Shrek dome, that kind of stuff, too many body functions in

[01:15:29.940 --> 01:15:32.480]
Good pool though, it's about what they say

[01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:35.500]
Which medical exam or procedure causes you the most anxiety?

[01:15:35.900 --> 01:15:37.240]
High anxiety baby

[01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:40.400]
Proctological exam, finger up the old, br

[01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:45.800]
I hate this pool of 160 and 11.3%

[01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:48.040]
I don't get that, do you get it?

[01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:50.040]
I heard you do get it

[01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:53.560]
Tooth extraction 73, dental exam 70

[01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:56.400]
Josh is gonna tell us about his young Russian girlfriend after the abray

[01:15:59.620 --> 01:16:02.320]
Okay, and about all the vodka that she keeps feeding

[01:16:03.340 --> 01:16:06.340]
Now does she actually drink vodka or is that just a stereotype?

[01:16:06.660 --> 01:16:09.300]
I mean she does, her family does a lot

[01:16:09.300 --> 01:16:11.240]
Yeah, vodka and cognac

[01:16:12.020 --> 01:16:13.040]
Cognac and vodka

[01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:13.460]
Yeah

[01:16:15.780 --> 01:16:19.580]
But you don't need to liquor her up to get her in the right frame of mind

[01:16:19.580 --> 01:16:23.420]
Well, the more liquored up the better, that's always good, it can't be a bad thing

[01:16:23.420 --> 01:16:23.720]
You're right

[01:16:23.720 --> 01:16:26.820]
Giving a blood sample 53, dental cleaning 52

[01:16:27.580 --> 01:16:30.340]
Giving a stool sample 38, oh no

[01:16:30.340 --> 01:16:32.160]
Isn't that what they do like in the pharmacy?

[01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:33.700]
What are you sitting on one of those stools?

[01:16:34.600 --> 01:16:36.140]
I sure miss those places man

[01:16:36.140 --> 01:16:38.960]
I hate to keep rehashing at the pharmacy, a diner places

[01:16:38.960 --> 01:16:42.100]
Oh, like the one on bird, bird, whatever it is

[01:16:42.100 --> 01:16:42.800]
Red bird

[01:16:44.100 --> 01:16:47.340]
Routine medical checkup 28, gyneological exam 27

[01:16:47.340 --> 01:16:49.300]
But the old treadmill test 26

[01:16:50.740 --> 01:16:53.520]
Every heart, every cardiologist man, whether you need it or not

[01:16:53.520 --> 01:16:54.980]
Oh, gotta have a treadmill test right now

[01:16:54.980 --> 01:16:57.340]
But I'm okay, yeah, but let's do it anyway, it's a lot of money

[01:16:57.340 --> 01:17:01.720]
Getting a shot 13, I exam 13, giving a urine sample 10

[01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:06.100]
And holding your breath in a way, finding out if all that magic, all those magic instructions work

[01:17:06.120 --> 01:17:11.260]
Breast exam 10 and EKG still only 7 times

[01:17:11.260 --> 01:17:14.680]
Kill my queen, God

[01:17:23.020 --> 01:17:25.480]
Reaching still good news

[01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:33.540]
How in thick hell have got new shows that are big scientists that means that

[01:17:33.540 --> 01:17:36.740]
They're back to baking gate shows again

[01:17:37.540 --> 01:17:38.740]
All my died

[01:17:39.540 --> 01:17:43.140]
The news did so, it's recycling

[01:17:43.140 --> 01:17:49.780]
They knew the version was what we need as a food and see to

[01:17:49.780 --> 01:17:53.620]
Do you know it right and they gave shows again?

[01:17:53.620 --> 01:18:01.560]
Just just baby, every moment you may burn baby

[01:18:01.560 --> 01:18:09.580]
Every moment of new news, ever coming in surface

[01:18:09.580 --> 01:18:11.940]
I'm fine, I'm okay

[01:18:11.940 --> 01:18:18.000]
I have got a secret and it's news to me

[01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:25.180]
You don't say it, I ever step to meet the whole

[01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:34.100]
Feats with luck, interdisks

[01:18:34.100 --> 01:18:38.380]
As time worked, he really was fun

[01:18:38.380 --> 01:18:42.860]
And all that magic, tell the truth, write the bank

[01:18:42.860 --> 01:18:45.860]
They've got you, lucky food, they don't know

[01:18:45.860 --> 01:18:48.620]
20, want you for the money, they say

[01:18:48.620 --> 01:18:53.120]
He said, he said, hell it tells you the money

[01:18:53.120 --> 01:18:56.580]
That you're lying there was every fightin' in

[01:18:56.580 --> 01:19:01.020]
I'm in love and not to mention that I'll yearn

[01:19:01.020 --> 01:19:04.860]
And feel comin' if it wasn't for them day

[01:19:04.860 --> 01:19:08.660]
Wouldn't think they can do good shows again

[01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:15.520]
Don't think they can do good shows again

[01:19:15.520 --> 01:19:17.420]
I remember I was playing that

[01:19:17.420 --> 01:19:19.920]
I'm not a George, but no, the George is out secretive

[01:19:19.920 --> 01:19:21.980]
Josh of course might know, but he forgets

[01:19:21.980 --> 01:19:22.900]
I'm sorry, that last bit

[01:19:22.900 --> 01:19:24.660]
Yeah, that game shows

[01:19:24.660 --> 01:19:25.160]
Are you kidding?

[01:19:26.120 --> 01:19:26.980]
You've heard that before?

[01:19:27.380 --> 01:19:27.940]
Many times

[01:19:28.520 --> 01:19:30.400]
Like I said, maybe George played it

[01:19:30.400 --> 01:19:32.520]
I've got something for you that is gonna every...

[01:19:32.520 --> 01:19:33.620]
I hate to do this at lunchtime

[01:19:33.620 --> 01:19:35.260]
If you're on a diet, this is perfect for you

[01:19:35.260 --> 01:19:37.720]
You want to get really grossed out, you want to see the most

[01:19:37.720 --> 01:19:40.540]
I mean, if you fat people out there like me, fat

[01:19:41.020 --> 01:19:43.900]
If you want to get something that should inspire you to quit the crap

[01:19:43.900 --> 01:19:45.380]
I was pretty gonna quit the crap

[01:19:45.380 --> 01:19:47.560]
Thanks a lot Chris, very electable

[01:19:48.860 --> 01:19:50.880]
He says, check out this website

[01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:54.800]
And it's all about, you know what we were talking about about cool andoscopies

[01:19:54.800 --> 01:19:56.680]
And your innards and all this other stuff

[01:19:56.680 --> 01:19:58.580]
And about a bunch of stuff like that

[01:19:59.300 --> 01:20:01.120]
Yeah, are you clean inside?

[01:20:01.720 --> 01:20:04.000]
Oh, this is just, especially if you have IBS

[01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:05.700]
And severe gas and bloating

[01:20:05.700 --> 01:20:07.640]
And like a lot of farting joys like that

[01:20:07.640 --> 01:20:08.980]
But anyway, before we get to that

[01:20:09.780 --> 01:20:12.740]
On our Myspace page, I just, it's on there now

[01:20:12.740 --> 01:20:13.720]
Eric, thank you Eric

[01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:16.760]
Go to the main page

[01:20:16.760 --> 01:20:18.720]
You're right next to Marlon Brando, okay

[01:20:18.720 --> 01:20:19.980]
We're the Godfather page

[01:20:20.720 --> 01:20:22.660]
And it says, you know it's almost spring

[01:20:22.660 --> 01:20:25.540]
When the girls start showing their navels

[01:20:25.540 --> 01:20:26.700]
They're belly buttons

[01:20:26.700 --> 01:20:27.760]
You see it?

[01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:29.040]
I'll be there in a second

[01:20:29.040 --> 01:20:31.120]
Oh boy, you see it Chris?

[01:20:32.560 --> 01:20:33.480]
I'm going there now

[01:20:34.320 --> 01:20:36.400]
When they start showing their belly buttons

[01:20:36.400 --> 01:20:37.120]
And there is a woman

[01:20:37.120 --> 01:20:38.940]
Oh my god

[01:20:41.100 --> 01:20:42.920]
Hang down your head, Tom Dooley

[01:20:42.920 --> 01:20:43.940]
What is that?

[01:20:44.780 --> 01:20:46.220]
It's an exorcismic

[01:20:46.220 --> 01:20:48.140]
And oh, am I right?

[01:20:48.580 --> 01:20:49.940]
That, oh that's just a scar

[01:20:52.840 --> 01:20:55.480]
That is the all time I swear to you

[01:20:56.060 --> 01:20:56.800]
War, you know

[01:20:57.480 --> 01:20:58.320]
What is it?

[01:20:58.540 --> 01:20:59.600]
It's the all time worst

[01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:02.460]
Have you ever seen anything so grotesque in your life?

[01:21:03.240 --> 01:21:04.640]
I mean, he is sitting there

[01:21:04.640 --> 01:21:06.220]
First of all, she's got a dress on

[01:21:06.220 --> 01:21:08.600]
That's probably a, I don't know what women dress sizes are

[01:21:08.600 --> 01:21:10.020]
Like a size 80, a triple likes

[01:21:10.020 --> 01:21:13.640]
And she's, it's much, it's several sizes too small

[01:21:13.640 --> 01:21:16.000]
You talk about June is rusting out all over

[01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.160]
This old, this bag, she's bigger than a cow

[01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:20.720]
And I like the sneakers she's got on too

[01:21:20.720 --> 01:21:21.300]
Are those socks?

[01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:22.220]
Is that classy?

[01:21:23.080 --> 01:21:24.560]
You check out the socks and the sneakers?

[01:21:25.340 --> 01:21:25.940]
I'm trying to

[01:21:25.940 --> 01:21:26.980]
Okay, where is this?

[01:21:27.180 --> 01:21:27.920]
I can't find it

[01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:29.700]
Go to his Myspace page

[01:21:29.700 --> 01:21:31.640]
I'm on your page, the first comment

[01:21:31.640 --> 01:21:34.080]
The one where the godfather with Marlon Brando

[01:21:35.500 --> 01:21:37.380]
That page, not that other page

[01:21:39.060 --> 01:21:40.140]
You see it?

[01:21:40.200 --> 01:21:41.080]
Oh my god

[01:21:41.080 --> 01:21:43.440]
Oh my god, everybody in town is gonna be going

[01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:44.500]
Oh my god

[01:21:44.500 --> 01:21:46.660]
I hate this show, you still have to take a look at that

[01:21:47.160 --> 01:21:49.640]
I hate it, I'm gonna see the save the well picture too

[01:21:49.640 --> 01:21:51.360]
Oh my god, that is just

[01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:53.960]
And she is showing her belly button for the spring

[01:21:53.960 --> 01:21:54.860]
That's for damn sure

[01:21:55.660 --> 01:21:56.640]
How is that possible?

[01:21:57.780 --> 01:22:00.180]
I've actually seen the beast that happened to the beast before

[01:22:01.220 --> 01:22:05.480]
I've got a second pupika small when all it's a lot smaller than all it used to be

[01:22:05.480 --> 01:22:08.740]
But it doesn't like hang down between my legs like that

[01:22:08.740 --> 01:22:09.980]
You know, all over the ground

[01:22:09.980 --> 01:22:11.680]
It's almost at her feet

[01:22:11.680 --> 01:22:13.360]
It's almost to her ankles

[01:22:13.360 --> 01:22:18.200]
It's almost to the top of the very flashy blue socks that she's wearing with a white sneakers, man

[01:22:18.200 --> 01:22:19.660]
You talk about a fashion plate

[01:22:19.660 --> 01:22:22.120]
She makes me look like Georgia R Money

[01:22:22.920 --> 01:22:24.420]
Like Helvin's Clines

[01:22:25.080 --> 01:22:30.160]
Have you ever seen anything so unspeakable, someone made the ball?

[01:22:30.160 --> 01:22:30.820]
No

[01:22:31.320 --> 01:22:34.040]
Now if that picture isn't taken in Tampa, I have no idea where it was

[01:22:34.040 --> 01:22:35.920]
Maybe in Temple Terrace or Loots

[01:22:37.340 --> 01:22:38.620]
As in I love Lootsley

[01:22:38.620 --> 01:22:41.220]
Oh brother, 1046 votes on the pool

[01:22:42.580 --> 01:22:46.200]
Now if you think I should really waste my time, we've got less than an hour until the Marlon pre-game show

[01:22:46.200 --> 01:22:48.920]
And we love those Marlon's baby because the Marlon's are

[01:22:48.920 --> 01:22:49.500]
Nice!

[01:22:50.040 --> 01:22:51.240]
Especially when they play early games

[01:22:51.660 --> 01:22:54.180]
Even though Dave Van Boring is very extremely

[01:22:54.700 --> 01:22:55.060]
Boring

[01:22:55.060 --> 01:22:58.020]
And Josh knows that he's in an off-theor, he's ripped him and asked me that

[01:22:58.020 --> 01:22:59.340]
I don't even say that

[01:22:59.740 --> 01:23:00.060]
What?

[01:23:00.460 --> 01:23:03.460]
It's just that Joe, why do you want to go back and work on his boring Marlon games again?

[01:23:03.540 --> 01:23:04.160]
You don't want to do that

[01:23:04.160 --> 01:23:06.800]
Look at the progress you've made since you got off of that garbage

[01:23:06.800 --> 01:23:07.620]
It's all money

[01:23:08.160 --> 01:23:10.600]
Hey they pay you know, they pay right?

[01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:11.060]
I guess

[01:23:11.060 --> 01:23:12.100]
And they pay you on time?

[01:23:12.580 --> 01:23:15.520]
Oh by the way, speaking of getting paid on time, chicken heck your thing is in the mail for me

[01:23:15.520 --> 01:23:16.560]
I don't know about the station there

[01:23:16.560 --> 01:23:18.300]
They don't take good care of him or anybody else

[01:23:19.180 --> 01:23:20.960]
The keeper, Joe Bell keeps running around

[01:23:20.960 --> 01:23:22.500]
Oh man, the sales is great

[01:23:22.500 --> 01:23:24.440]
The building is up and we're making the ziggins

[01:23:24.440 --> 01:23:26.640]
You know, that's great Joe, I'm handy for you, Johnny Joe

[01:23:26.640 --> 01:23:28.740]
But if that's the case, how come lighten to pay your bills?

[01:23:29.300 --> 01:23:32.060]
Because it's the Beasley way, it's not Joe, it's the Beasley's man

[01:23:33.280 --> 01:23:35.400]
The Beasley's put the M in measly

[01:23:35.400 --> 01:23:36.680]
Trust me when I tell you

[01:23:36.680 --> 01:23:40.160]
How to meet constipation, IBS bloating, stomach pain

[01:23:40.720 --> 01:23:44.060]
And skin problems while getting more energy and flatter stomach at the same time

[01:23:44.060 --> 01:23:48.160]
See I figured this is a good story for that poor lady who's sitting there hanging down her head like Tom Dooley

[01:23:49.160 --> 01:23:51.440]
Sitting on a bench in Temple Terrace

[01:23:52.480 --> 01:23:56.620]
It says the people in the pictures above as well as thousands of others who stories you'll find on Dr. D.

[01:24:10.960 --> 01:24:18.980]
And they say, you're going to be a great partner in nature, you're going to be a great partner

[01:24:18.980 --> 01:24:18.980]

[01:24:18.980 --> 01:24:18.980]

[01:24:18.980 --> 01:24:19.060]
And they say, you're going to be a great partner in nature, you're going to be a great partner in nature

[01:24:19.060 --> 01:24:19.140]
And they say, you're going to be a great partner in nature, you're going to be a great partner in nature

[01:24:19.140 --> 01:24:20.940]
And they say, you're going to be a great partner in nature, you're going to be a great partner in nature

[01:24:20.940 --> 01:24:26.600]
And they say, you're going to be a great partner in nature, you're going to be a great partner in nature

[01:24:26.600 --> 01:24:31.180]
If you've been struggling with these problems for some time, chances are you've tried everything to make the pain go away

[01:24:31.180 --> 01:24:36.920]
If you've been working in radio for like a zillion years, you've tried everything to make the pain go away, except on payday

[01:24:36.920 --> 01:24:40.440]
So DJ Lyzen is making a million bucks, I'm good for him, I'm off of the talent

[01:24:41.700 --> 01:24:44.900]
Even if he is a pimple with a gimp and a limp

[01:24:44.900 --> 01:24:47.920]
You've tried Laxit, there's another over-the-counter prescription drug, she says

[01:24:47.920 --> 01:24:52.200]
Commercial fiber supplements, maybe even colonoscopy or surgeries, how do you like that?

[01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:52.600]
Correct them

[01:24:53.540 --> 01:24:55.460]
Always to know a VLA while you're still suffering

[01:24:55.460 --> 01:24:58.600]
Why? Because the root cause of the problem was never eliminated

[01:24:58.600 --> 01:25:00.460]
Is that like a little plan where it's there never eliminated?

[01:25:00.760 --> 01:25:03.420]
This thing goes on for I could read this to the middle of the fourth inning

[01:25:03.420 --> 01:25:04.140]
At least

[01:25:04.680 --> 01:25:05.140]
That's not good

[01:25:05.940 --> 01:25:09.780]
So what is the root cause of most digestive ailments? Look at the picture below

[01:25:09.780 --> 01:25:10.420]
Oh

[01:25:11.620 --> 01:25:11.980]
Whoa

[01:25:14.040 --> 01:25:20.120]
How would you feel if long pieces of old toxin-filled fecal matter were stuck to the inside of your colon for months or even years?

[01:25:20.120 --> 01:25:23.040]
Oh my goodness, that is nasty

[01:25:23.040 --> 01:25:26.240]
You think that picture of that brought on to you with a stomach hang-a down is nasty?

[01:25:26.640 --> 01:25:27.920]
You don't want to see this

[01:25:28.420 --> 01:25:31.300]
Would you feel constipated, bloated and lethargic?

[01:25:31.300 --> 01:25:37.080]
Would your balls be irritated by this debris day in and day out causing what we call IBS irritable, bowel syndrome, huh?

[01:25:38.300 --> 01:25:41.900]
Just think about what else toxic build-up like this can cause stomach pain and constipation

[01:25:41.900 --> 01:25:46.920]
Fatigue, gas and bloating, headaches and indigestion, weight gain and a large protruding belly

[01:25:47.360 --> 01:25:49.440]
See, there you go, that's especially for her

[01:25:49.440 --> 01:25:51.760]
A large protruding pupic

[01:25:52.460 --> 01:25:59.300]
You probably never heard about this before as this is the literally the dirtiest secret in America today as the vegetarian time so aptly wrote

[01:25:59.840 --> 01:26:04.880]
Of all the polite topics of conversation the state of one's intestines is probably at the bottom of most people's list

[01:26:04.880 --> 01:26:06.020]
Yes, near the well, you're bottom

[01:26:06.920 --> 01:26:13.400]
Let's face it irritable, bowel syndrome, constipation, gas, diverticulation and colonic colon cancer are simply not things we'd like to discuss

[01:26:13.400 --> 01:26:15.000]
Not a polite company, like us

[01:26:15.640 --> 01:26:20.120]
And yet as the old expression goes, death begins in the colon, you know that guy's death begins in the colon?

[01:26:20.300 --> 01:26:20.780]
Yes, what I heard

[01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:24.840]
Yeah, that's what they see in outer space, death begins in your anus

[01:26:25.420 --> 01:26:31.080]
Don't believe it, ask any coroner, octopsies often reveal colonns that are plugged up to 80% with waste material

[01:26:31.080 --> 01:26:34.360]
Oh, that's what the vegetarian time says, what do they know?

[01:26:35.620 --> 01:26:42.340]
You can stop suffering in silence from these painful, often embarrassing health conditions by learning how body pollution and toxic colon can be the cause of all these things

[01:26:42.340 --> 01:26:48.300]
And then Dr. Natura wants to study after reading another seven-zillion, oh, I'm looking at these gross pictures of, oh

[01:26:49.300 --> 01:26:55.540]
And they're not really pictures, they're all drawings, they're all these parasites that are crawling around inside your body

[01:26:55.540 --> 01:26:56.640]
And then a disgusting thought?

[01:26:56.940 --> 01:27:01.540]
Yes, if there are parasites inside, I think I got a tapeworm, every time I get hungry for ice cream

[01:27:01.540 --> 01:27:05.420]
I think I have a tapeworm that's just dying for like bastard robins or something like that

[01:27:05.420 --> 01:27:09.140]
Which I did go to the other day, I went to GNC, I told the story but you weren't there

[01:27:09.140 --> 01:27:13.780]
I went to GNC to get my co-cuting with some other vitamins and then I go to bastard robins

[01:27:14.840 --> 01:27:17.420]
And you get a three-stube rocky road hot-fights Sunday

[01:27:17.420 --> 01:27:22.240]
Well, I mean if you're going to get something for your health and then you're eating ice cream and your old diabetic like me, that's not good

[01:27:22.600 --> 01:27:28.200]
No, you're telling me to go to Sonic next time I'm in Florida and get a whole bunch of stuff in a banana split to top it all off too

[01:27:28.200 --> 01:27:28.860]
Get some grease?

[01:27:29.540 --> 01:27:30.560]
They have banana splits?

[01:27:30.840 --> 01:27:31.320]
Yes, they do

[01:27:31.760 --> 01:27:33.580]
Like Alan's pharmacy, I'm reddened and a bird

[01:27:34.480 --> 01:27:37.300]
That's the place I was trying to thank him, well, she by the way, Alan's pharmacy

[01:27:37.300 --> 01:27:39.400]
That what ice cream you're at these days, the rocky road?

[01:27:41.320 --> 01:27:46.380]
Mmm, but anyway, Alan's, when we were at IOD they came in because they used to rave about the great banana splits

[01:27:46.380 --> 01:27:49.500]
Because they have the old-fashioned fountain in their knowledge pharmacy when the last going anywhere

[01:27:51.140 --> 01:27:52.640]
And it's a reddened bird

[01:27:54.120 --> 01:27:58.740]
And they brought in tubs of ice cream and they made George and made them at his banana splits right there in the studio

[01:27:58.740 --> 01:28:01.440]
They brought in all the fixings you know and the accoutrements and stuff

[01:28:02.380 --> 01:28:02.740]
Mmm

[01:28:03.680 --> 01:28:06.160]
Yeah, what's wrong with rocky road? You know anybody that's like rocky road

[01:28:06.160 --> 01:28:09.260]
Especially if it's made right and got the little marshmallows and you know the little ones

[01:28:09.260 --> 01:28:10.040]
Love it

[01:28:10.040 --> 01:28:10.700]
Am I right?

[01:28:11.500 --> 01:28:12.880]
What's not to like baby?

[01:28:13.320 --> 01:28:14.480]
Rocky road

[01:28:14.480 --> 01:28:17.520]
So, what's the best challenge to this dish?

[01:28:17.620 --> 01:28:20.440]
That's a quick one, Chuck, for you to see some of what's right right now

[01:28:20.440 --> 01:28:21.580]
You am

[01:28:22.120 --> 01:28:27.360]
This is Brandy Quinn, whatever I shape my balls, I listen to the Neil Rogers 12-1 hour

[01:28:27.360 --> 01:28:56.060]

[01:28:56.060 --> 01:29:04.700]
I want to give to the one a day but there's no chance at all so does nothing for me a sports queen if I want to see him grab the ball

[01:29:04.700 --> 01:29:05.200]

[01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:06.900]
Oh baby wow!

[01:29:07.620 --> 01:29:09.180]
Look at that kid!

[01:29:09.960 --> 01:29:13.100]
You ain't seen on that bike like gravy!

[01:29:13.500 --> 01:29:13.680]
Wait!

[01:29:19.360 --> 01:29:23.240]
I gotta hide and keep the screen and help to receive his balloons!

[01:29:24.540 --> 01:29:28.080]
I can do a lot of wanna but I ain't gonna never get done!

[01:29:28.260 --> 01:29:28.660]
Brackum!

[01:29:29.140 --> 01:29:30.900]
No need days up of business school!

[01:29:31.200 --> 01:29:32.680]
Okay, that's not so great!

[01:29:33.240 --> 01:29:37.280]
But I'll go somewhere with a demanding at least until at least 28!

[01:29:38.380 --> 01:29:38.960]
I'm free!

[01:29:39.380 --> 01:29:40.660]
Now rock solid!

[01:29:40.900 --> 01:29:42.120]
I want some quick!

[01:29:42.820 --> 01:29:45.940]
You ain't seen no man quite like gravy!

[01:29:46.420 --> 01:29:46.600]
Wait!

[01:29:47.720 --> 01:29:49.100]
We'll lay it be wow!

[01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:51.520]
Look at that kid!

[01:29:52.300 --> 01:29:55.300]
You ain't seen no man quite like gravy!

[01:29:55.520 --> 01:29:56.060]
Yeah Tom Brady!

[01:29:56.280 --> 01:29:59.180]
He's too busy anyway and I'm proud that he every hot chicken in the world.

[01:29:59.320 --> 01:30:01.880]
He wants to be the father of the universe like us and he's busy.

[01:30:02.060 --> 01:30:04.580]
Even a clean cut guy like Tom Brady is doing a you know what?

[01:30:05.620 --> 01:30:06.480]
1073 on a pool.

[01:30:07.520 --> 01:30:13.120]
So the bad news is my buddy Steven says that picnics diner in Alan's 8th there no mo.

[01:30:13.680 --> 01:30:15.060]
It's separated and moved on the street.

[01:30:15.220 --> 01:30:16.300]
Now do you have any idea what that means?

[01:30:16.480 --> 01:30:17.480]
I don't understand what that means.

[01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:18.720]
It means separated.

[01:30:19.200 --> 01:30:19.420]
What?

[01:30:19.600 --> 01:30:20.700]
I never heard of it to begin with.

[01:30:21.300 --> 01:30:22.880]
But what does that mean that picnics diner?

[01:30:22.920 --> 01:30:23.860]
I don't even know what that means.

[01:30:24.120 --> 01:30:25.480]
What does a picnics diner?

[01:30:26.460 --> 01:30:27.320]
You know what that means?

[01:30:27.800 --> 01:30:27.880]
No.

[01:30:30.340 --> 01:30:33.340]
Because see what's upon the time I know a lot of you young punks aren't familiar because

[01:30:33.340 --> 01:30:35.540]
you're not old and people aren't gonna die pretty soon like me.

[01:30:35.540 --> 01:30:39.920]
But the fact of the matter is once upon a time most of your pharmacies like that hotel

[01:30:39.920 --> 01:30:42.900]
pharmacy remember that Chris I was talking about that day when I found out money on the

[01:30:42.900 --> 01:30:44.140]
street on Miami Beach.

[01:30:44.160 --> 01:30:47.260]
I found like two five dollar bills or whatever the hell it was and I went in and had me

[01:30:47.260 --> 01:30:49.280]
a nice cheeseburger and a banana splitter something.

[01:30:49.600 --> 01:30:50.180]
A lot of my talking.

[01:30:51.100 --> 01:30:51.220]
What?

[01:30:51.600 --> 01:30:52.460]
Thought it was a 20.

[01:30:52.520 --> 01:30:55.700]
Well whatever it was it wasn't one bill it was like a I don't know maybe a couple of

[01:30:55.700 --> 01:30:56.640]
fives and three singles.

[01:30:56.660 --> 01:30:58.720]
I think it was more like 13 lucky 13.

[01:31:00.240 --> 01:31:02.220]
That was one of the most bizarre experiences.

[01:31:02.220 --> 01:31:05.940]
I mean not that I was like a popper anything but I just didn't have any cash and a bank

[01:31:05.940 --> 01:31:10.320]
the ATM at the flagship bank there on all the road wasn't working and I couldn't give

[01:31:10.320 --> 01:31:11.040]
me no cash.

[01:31:11.220 --> 01:31:13.680]
And of course you think that I had credit cards back in those days.

[01:31:13.840 --> 01:31:16.980]
Oh yeah the KET days making 225 bucks a week.

[01:31:18.060 --> 01:31:18.860]
That fell out of money.

[01:31:19.420 --> 01:31:19.740]
What?

[01:31:20.280 --> 01:31:21.620]
225 a week yet for you it would be.

[01:31:21.900 --> 01:31:24.800]
Well I had a budget my money man I had to save a lot of money from picking up all

[01:31:24.800 --> 01:31:26.080]
of my hustlers on this game Boulevard.

[01:31:26.680 --> 01:31:28.360]
You know so it's a matter of a priorities.

[01:31:29.780 --> 01:31:33.540]
Now let's see here's what Moyshie says the diner inside moved across the street it's

[01:31:33.540 --> 01:31:34.560]
not in Allens anymore.

[01:31:35.040 --> 01:31:35.960]
That's okay.

[01:31:37.200 --> 01:31:39.980]
Okay I'll take whatever you guys out to take your word for it.

[01:31:40.780 --> 01:31:44.880]
But like I'm starting to say is that just about any pharmacy were even Woolworths.

[01:31:45.360 --> 01:31:46.260]
Remember Woolworths?

[01:31:46.560 --> 01:31:46.880]
No.

[01:31:47.560 --> 01:31:52.100]
Get out of here like five in dime stores they used to have nice news five in dime and

[01:31:52.100 --> 01:31:53.120]
Woolworths come on.

[01:31:53.540 --> 01:31:56.060]
You're starting to make me feel like some kind of an old fart here today.

[01:31:56.940 --> 01:31:57.340]
Hmm.

[01:31:58.000 --> 01:31:59.880]
I haven't update on that pic mix place.

[01:32:00.240 --> 01:32:01.040]
Okay what does that mean?

[01:32:01.560 --> 01:32:04.640]
That was the name of a diner inside Allen drug.

[01:32:05.140 --> 01:32:05.360]
Right.

[01:32:05.460 --> 01:32:09.420]
Drugs or whatever and they I guess said you know what work too good to just be inside

[01:32:09.420 --> 01:32:11.920]
this place so they move down across the street your own place.

[01:32:12.340 --> 01:32:12.720]
I see.

[01:32:13.160 --> 01:32:14.220]
That's care of the beast.

[01:32:14.780 --> 01:32:18.520]
Well thanks beast all my correspondents out there all the food experts are feeding

[01:32:18.520 --> 01:32:19.380]
me all this stuff.

[01:32:19.900 --> 01:32:22.860]
But the point I was trying to make is that when George and I talked about it see this

[01:32:22.860 --> 01:32:26.640]
is back in the day when a we were like on a real radio station that wasn't just talking

[01:32:26.640 --> 01:32:29.420]
about ball games and juxtapes and B we had an audience.

[01:32:29.600 --> 01:32:31.780]
Oh, oh, not long for those days.

[01:32:32.860 --> 01:32:36.200]
And I would be and so we go on the year and we talk about just about any kind of business

[01:32:36.200 --> 01:32:38.740]
establishment with food and before you know it there they would be.

[01:32:39.480 --> 01:32:43.220]
And so we're graven about because back in the day that dinner was still inside the

[01:32:43.220 --> 01:32:47.100]
Allen's drugs it was one of the last in town maybe the last in town had that old fashioned

[01:32:47.100 --> 01:32:51.480]
diner you know where you go in and the old soda jerk would be standing behind a counter.

[01:32:51.480 --> 01:32:53.360]
Never see a soda jerk but anyway.

[01:32:54.580 --> 01:32:59.600]
Well look at that there's the latest CNN Clinton's 37 Obama 22 Gore 14 Edwards 12.

[01:33:00.020 --> 01:33:02.780]
What happened to that press conference was he on there already or not probably not.

[01:33:02.800 --> 01:33:04.280]
No they're showing setting up for it still.

[01:33:04.640 --> 01:33:10.000]
So I'll read this is nationwide later CNN pull so we're 37 Obama 22 Gore 14 and Edwards

[01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:13.420]
12 he's got two chances you know none and much much less than none.

[01:33:13.760 --> 01:33:16.200]
Why am I talking so much about bananas but they that's not good.

[01:33:16.940 --> 01:33:19.300]
Because you're going to put me in the mood for when I'm going to go right over to the

[01:33:19.300 --> 01:33:22.080]
eating center and I'm going to zip on in there don't do it.

[01:33:22.220 --> 01:33:26.500]
I'm not going to do that and then I'll probably get about 10 gallons of rocky road because

[01:33:26.500 --> 01:33:30.140]
of your bad influence too it looked like that lady sitting on the railroads right now.

[01:33:30.380 --> 01:33:34.600]
Anybody who hasn't seen that picture seriously don't I know I know it's not a good time

[01:33:34.600 --> 01:33:38.740]
to do it it's right smack dab in the beginning of lunch hour but oh boy look at that from

[01:33:38.740 --> 01:33:43.160]
January to now Obama went up four points in swallowing drop three it was 34 18 or she

[01:33:43.160 --> 01:33:48.520]
went up three he went up four whatever most people don't even know who he is yet just

[01:33:48.520 --> 01:33:52.500]
wait until he starts speaking and put an arrest to shame and wait till most people

[01:33:52.500 --> 01:33:56.080]
realize that he's just another apologist for the Bush and right wing and these Nazis

[01:33:56.080 --> 01:34:00.140]
and his whole obnoxious war when they find that out they're going to say screw that bitch

[01:34:02.040 --> 01:34:04.620]
and you know what Bubba is going to say no you first.

[01:34:06.660 --> 01:34:09.360]
1207 and they were still waiting there I guess we do the break now because then we'll

[01:34:09.360 --> 01:34:12.440]
find out this birthday announcement from John and Elizabeth Edwards.

[01:34:12.440 --> 01:34:16.680]
In toy stores now it's the all new fed-ass Barbie.

[01:34:16.780 --> 01:34:18.920]
Fedass Barbie looks cool in her mumble.

[01:34:18.960 --> 01:34:22.460]
Oh Fedass Barbie's got a huge ass just like mommy.

[01:34:22.620 --> 01:34:24.700]
Fedass Barbie's tons of fun.

[01:34:24.740 --> 01:34:28.780]
Mom Fedass Barbie ate my sandwich so I broke her head off.

[01:34:29.280 --> 01:34:32.340]
Fedass Barbie couch TV and bond bonds sold separately.

[01:34:32.480 --> 01:34:33.840]
Lots of big bad ass.

[01:34:34.520 --> 01:34:38.400]
From 11 to 560 and so is that one picture man I looked at that again I just want to

[01:34:38.490 --> 01:34:39.130]
leave my guts.

[01:34:39.530 --> 01:34:42.670]
Awaiting the announcement from John and Elizabeth Edwards and there's candy cowly speaking

[01:34:42.670 --> 01:34:43.050]
of that.

[01:34:43.250 --> 01:34:48.330]
Wow Johnny G who's desperate for attention today just relax Johnny okay just a radio show

[01:34:48.330 --> 01:34:50.050]
calm down take a nice nap.

[01:34:50.510 --> 01:34:55.890]
He says across from U of M Don's discount drugs had a soda fountain bar.

[01:34:56.830 --> 01:34:58.410]
Head as in past tense.

[01:35:00.030 --> 01:35:03.990]
Thanks Johnny like I said take a long nap just relax everything is over everything is just

[01:35:03.990 --> 01:35:04.910]
fine Johnny.

[01:35:05.370 --> 01:35:09.270]
I'm getting back to this stuff that I was reading here about doctor Uranus or whatever

[01:35:09.270 --> 01:35:10.510]
that was what was the name of the guy.

[01:35:11.070 --> 01:35:11.850]
Yes I'll look at it.

[01:35:12.030 --> 01:35:16.070]
And then there's a thing in here that this is where I don't tell me I lost it.

[01:35:16.150 --> 01:35:17.090]
Oh here it is.

[01:35:17.710 --> 01:35:22.350]
Discover magazine published a feature article in its August 2000 issue and this is what

[01:35:22.350 --> 01:35:22.890]
they said.

[01:35:23.110 --> 01:35:27.930]
Every living thing has at least one parasite that lives inside or on it and many including

[01:35:27.930 --> 01:35:29.210]
humans have far more.

[01:35:29.690 --> 01:35:33.830]
Oh wasn't bad enough you made us look at that picture on my space there with a fat

[01:35:33.830 --> 01:35:37.310]
broad with a public hanging down the ground to our ankles with those really nifty socks

[01:35:37.310 --> 01:35:38.230]
in the sneakers.

[01:35:38.730 --> 01:35:42.030]
Well you have a good parasites and you humans have good parasites also.

[01:35:43.150 --> 01:35:43.830]
How about parasites?

[01:35:44.690 --> 01:35:45.750]
I won't win that usually.

[01:35:46.230 --> 01:35:49.150]
Scientists are really just beginning to discover exactly how powerful these hidden

[01:35:49.150 --> 01:35:54.030]
inhabitants can be but the research is pointing to a remarkable possibility parasites may

[01:35:54.030 --> 01:35:55.630]
rule the world how do you like that.

[01:35:55.670 --> 01:35:56.630]
Oh my god.

[01:35:56.790 --> 01:36:00.290]
An ocean that tiny creatures we've largely taken for granted are such a dominant forces

[01:36:00.290 --> 01:36:01.470]
is immensely disturbing.

[01:36:01.990 --> 01:36:05.730]
We are collections of cells that work together kept harmonized by chemical signals.

[01:36:06.530 --> 01:36:10.690]
If an organism can control those signals an organism like a parasite then it can control

[01:36:10.690 --> 01:36:14.490]
us and they realize the peculiar and precise horror of parasites.

[01:36:15.510 --> 01:36:17.850]
Well this is some heavy duty stuff if I can say that.

[01:36:18.150 --> 01:36:18.610]
Can I say that?

[01:36:19.750 --> 01:36:20.050]
Sure.

[01:36:20.430 --> 01:36:20.690]
Do it.

[01:36:22.230 --> 01:36:23.090]
You do it.

[01:36:23.530 --> 01:36:24.290]
You've done it.

[01:36:24.850 --> 01:36:28.590]
The combination of environmental toxins and unhealthy diet and parasites poses a grave

[01:36:28.590 --> 01:36:29.170]
danger to humans.

[01:36:29.450 --> 01:36:34.850]
In fact it says the National Geographic says parasites have killed more humans than all

[01:36:34.850 --> 01:36:38.290]
the wars in history and it's award-winning documentary The Body Snatchers.

[01:36:38.510 --> 01:36:41.490]
If you don't believe parasites can exist in people in America then just read thousands

[01:36:41.490 --> 01:36:42.890]
of true personal stories on this site.

[01:36:43.030 --> 01:36:45.230]
It says it will start right now and go through the top of the eighth inning.

[01:36:46.610 --> 01:36:50.850]
And of course this is all an ad for internal cleansing and some product to detoxify your

[01:36:50.850 --> 01:36:55.030]
body and to give it a parasites and all those cold decolonics program.

[01:36:55.030 --> 01:36:59.030]
And here's the guy Charlie says I lost 40 pounds he still looks like a fat slub.

[01:36:59.130 --> 01:36:59.910]
I feel terrific.

[01:36:59.990 --> 01:37:00.750]
You're fat Charlie.

[01:37:01.710 --> 01:37:07.330]
My girlfriend bought this program from the Christmas 2005 to detoxify his innards.

[01:37:07.490 --> 01:37:09.270]
Sounds like a really appetizing kind of guy.

[01:37:09.490 --> 01:37:12.950]
When your girlfriend buys it starts buying your product to clean your colon out that's

[01:37:12.950 --> 01:37:15.150]
just a lot about what your girlfriend's out to do.

[01:37:15.370 --> 01:37:17.610]
Or maybe the girlfriend's that old bag sitting there on an adventure.

[01:37:18.490 --> 01:37:19.570]
Nice going Charlie.

[01:37:20.910 --> 01:37:21.190]
Yeah.

[01:37:21.190 --> 01:37:22.570]
I stopped and think about that pairing.

[01:37:22.970 --> 01:37:24.270]
Stop and think about that meeting.

[01:37:28.810 --> 01:37:29.530]
Oh man.

[01:37:30.170 --> 01:37:31.590]
Talk about let's get a surge party.

[01:37:32.250 --> 01:37:33.290]
A thousand ninety votes on a pool.

[01:37:33.370 --> 01:37:35.450]
We got eleven hundred elect even with a early ballgame.

[01:37:36.070 --> 01:37:37.290]
We're still waiting for the announcement.

[01:37:37.750 --> 01:37:40.190]
And here's Bill Schneider and there's a Johnny Edwards old file footage.

[01:37:40.650 --> 01:37:41.050]
Come on out.

[01:37:41.130 --> 01:37:42.330]
It's already twelve fourteen John.

[01:37:42.470 --> 01:37:43.070]
You can do it.

[01:37:43.430 --> 01:37:46.350]
Don't you hate when they do this and they got all the microphones up there in all the

[01:37:46.350 --> 01:37:46.810]
camera minutes.

[01:37:47.190 --> 01:37:48.550]
Sooner or later he's going to come out at noon.

[01:37:48.550 --> 01:37:48.890]
Yes.

[01:37:48.890 --> 01:37:52.750]
That's twelve fifteen in the East Coast twelve fifteen and he's still in their parking

[01:37:52.750 --> 01:37:54.850]
around to get anybody to vote for me.

[01:37:54.990 --> 01:37:57.190]
Oh no not really WQAM.

[01:37:57.190 --> 01:37:57.510]
Hello.

[01:37:58.330 --> 01:37:59.350]
Afternoon Uncle Neil.

[01:37:59.730 --> 01:38:00.270]
Yes sir.

[01:38:00.890 --> 01:38:01.870]
Speaking of parasite.

[01:38:02.270 --> 01:38:05.050]
Did you happen to catch a stop park last night?

[01:38:05.390 --> 01:38:05.550]
No.

[01:38:06.110 --> 01:38:10.350]
The best part is at the end but I know you're watching from time to time but hanging

[01:38:10.350 --> 01:38:14.350]
this at the very end it's a it's a it's a hoot and it's about parasite.

[01:38:14.810 --> 01:38:16.190]
Did you catch the one from last week?

[01:38:16.190 --> 01:38:17.270]
I know George he's sometimes.

[01:38:17.270 --> 01:38:21.990]
I try to find that one the only one I saw is the one about the planet area.

[01:38:22.230 --> 01:38:22.750]
You know I'm not.

[01:38:23.370 --> 01:38:25.570]
The one from last week is probably one of the bats.

[01:38:25.770 --> 01:38:31.530]
There's a certain part of butter's body which winds up in Clarkman's rectum.

[01:38:31.770 --> 01:38:32.670]
I see okay fine.

[01:38:33.330 --> 01:38:36.310]
Ten ninety on a poll thousand ninety votes like I said we are eleven hundred

[01:38:36.310 --> 01:38:36.490]
lick.

[01:38:36.650 --> 01:38:38.150]
Things are just as fine as you I want.

[01:38:38.250 --> 01:38:38.910]
You only bad news.

[01:38:39.110 --> 01:38:40.470]
Well I guess it's not bad news.

[01:38:41.210 --> 01:38:44.350]
Why does it have to be bad news if they still got that nice diner and they just moved

[01:38:44.350 --> 01:38:47.230]
to the cross the street from Alan's drugs what's wrong with that at least it's still

[01:38:47.230 --> 01:38:50.050]
there you know and it's probably bigger and better.

[01:38:50.730 --> 01:38:53.570]
It could be bigger and better that's what we need to do is get a report not just that

[01:38:53.570 --> 01:38:56.870]
it's across the street that's that's the nice start but they still make I'm sure they

[01:38:56.870 --> 01:38:57.070]
do.

[01:38:58.010 --> 01:39:00.950]
See that's the thing back in the day I don't want to sound like one of those old

[01:39:00.950 --> 01:39:03.690]
timers well sunny on you young whipper staffers.

[01:39:03.850 --> 01:39:05.130]
How do I ever want to be like that?

[01:39:05.230 --> 01:39:06.090]
Well you've been known.

[01:39:07.150 --> 01:39:10.570]
Well nobody but it's true there's a lot of good stuff that's gone even in your lifetime

[01:39:10.570 --> 01:39:12.410]
and your brief life time you're about twenty three.

[01:39:12.970 --> 01:39:13.350]
Yeah.

[01:39:13.730 --> 01:39:16.910]
I get twenty three year old punks to think you know something but even in your lifetime

[01:39:16.910 --> 01:39:18.410]
you've seen some good things come and go.

[01:39:19.090 --> 01:39:19.670]
Am I right?

[01:39:20.370 --> 01:39:20.710]
Yeah.

[01:39:22.050 --> 01:39:22.430]
No.

[01:39:22.810 --> 01:39:24.350]
Can't think of anything right off the top of my head.

[01:39:24.350 --> 01:39:25.290]
Well I'm sure you're right.

[01:39:25.710 --> 01:39:27.470]
Like like real radio for example.

[01:39:27.710 --> 01:39:28.090]
There you go.

[01:39:28.270 --> 01:39:30.290]
See that disappeared as one even in your lifetime.

[01:39:30.610 --> 01:39:30.750]
Yes.

[01:39:31.110 --> 01:39:32.730]
Vanishing the thin air like it was never there.

[01:39:34.850 --> 01:39:38.510]
But they used to have the great thing about that like you're going to get a melted milk

[01:39:38.510 --> 01:39:43.390]
you know they were those the ice cold steel shaker things that they had that they put

[01:39:43.390 --> 01:39:46.250]
on the machine mine and they make your milk shaker melted.

[01:39:46.550 --> 01:39:51.290]
Oh there is nothing out and of course that's probably the way they make them like it's

[01:39:51.290 --> 01:39:54.290]
sonic is not one of the things that are said and I think that the staking shakes got great

[01:39:54.290 --> 01:39:54.750]
shakes.

[01:39:56.950 --> 01:39:57.670]
Staking shake.

[01:39:57.910 --> 01:39:58.870]
Sonic also.

[01:39:59.330 --> 01:40:00.590]
Sonic has the icy.

[01:40:01.850 --> 01:40:02.410]
That's what they were.

[01:40:02.550 --> 01:40:06.230]
What is that like frozen ice like a tad yeah like yeah like crushed it.

[01:40:06.250 --> 01:40:06.570]
Oh no not.

[01:40:06.730 --> 01:40:08.070]
And I think you know what that.

[01:40:08.070 --> 01:40:09.830]
No not like an Italian ice.

[01:40:09.990 --> 01:40:10.710]
Listen to what I'm saying.

[01:40:11.290 --> 01:40:14.930]
It's like crushed up ice enough or like you could just order a lemonade but there's so

[01:40:14.930 --> 01:40:18.170]
much crushed up ice it's basically an icy you know what I mean.

[01:40:18.170 --> 01:40:18.470]
Yeah.

[01:40:18.630 --> 01:40:19.490]
They're home for it.

[01:40:19.590 --> 01:40:20.390]
I'm telling you love that.

[01:40:20.710 --> 01:40:23.770]
They're in their commercials and they probably serve it to you like an a frosted mug.

[01:40:24.170 --> 01:40:26.090]
Now just a little styrofoam cup.

[01:40:26.370 --> 01:40:29.930]
Oh well and a styrofoam cup what kind of hazard is that.

[01:40:29.990 --> 01:40:30.650]
Crush me it's good.

[01:40:30.690 --> 01:40:33.850]
I'm serving like A&L and you used to with a root beer and a frosted mug man it kind

[01:40:33.850 --> 01:40:35.170]
of frosted.

[01:40:35.650 --> 01:40:36.650]
That's the way to do it.

[01:40:37.810 --> 01:40:38.550]
I'll find it.

[01:40:40.690 --> 01:40:42.350]
I'll find it here if it's a last dancing.

[01:40:44.490 --> 01:40:45.350]
I'll find it.

[01:40:45.510 --> 01:40:45.710]
It's coming.

[01:40:46.410 --> 01:40:46.850]
No just.

[01:40:47.170 --> 01:40:47.710]
Oh here we go.

[01:40:47.890 --> 01:40:48.110]
It's only.

[01:40:48.270 --> 01:40:50.670]
That really crushed my ass a little bit.

[01:40:50.710 --> 01:40:51.250]
There you go.

[01:40:51.270 --> 01:40:51.790]
There you go.

[01:40:52.230 --> 01:40:52.530]
Poor Harry.

[01:40:52.670 --> 01:40:54.090]
Yeah I told you soon to relate I find.

[01:40:54.550 --> 01:40:58.030]
Well there's like 17 different listings of Harry on there and almost none of them are

[01:40:58.030 --> 01:40:58.670]
reading him anyway.

[01:40:59.750 --> 01:41:03.070]
1094 on a pool we got 1100 we got that kicked ancient style.

[01:41:04.290 --> 01:41:05.070]
WDQ way and hello.

[01:41:05.690 --> 01:41:09.690]
Hey I think I was much like you made me laugh today man that was great about the guy's

[01:41:09.690 --> 01:41:11.490]
girlfriend was buying stuff for Christmas.

[01:41:12.130 --> 01:41:16.090]
Yeah advertising if your girlfriend buys you that for your birthday or for a holiday

[01:41:16.090 --> 01:41:20.010]
it says here's a high colonic treatment drink this you slob yeah.

[01:41:20.010 --> 01:41:21.330]
What did I tell you?

[01:41:21.910 --> 01:41:24.390]
Yeah I was throwing off the road man keep it off you do it great.

[01:41:24.550 --> 01:41:25.010]
Thanks pal.

[01:41:25.170 --> 01:41:28.730]
Yeah it means the means guys probably farting up a storm and is disgusting and grotesque

[01:41:28.730 --> 01:41:30.890]
and she would even do him by long distance you know.

[01:41:30.890 --> 01:41:32.730]
If he mailed it and she don't want it.

[01:41:34.530 --> 01:41:38.250]
I don't care what anybody says we've done that pool before and you people I guess try

[01:41:38.250 --> 01:41:43.410]
to be nice to your spouse or whatever or your um you know your significant other as

[01:41:43.410 --> 01:41:44.090]
they say other.

[01:41:44.330 --> 01:41:46.390]
Yeah that's that woman on the bench significant other.

[01:41:46.690 --> 01:41:48.330]
Oh you say she's got one?

[01:41:49.050 --> 01:41:49.730]
She's got something.

[01:41:51.310 --> 01:41:55.310]
But some of you people you get married and you're young and you both look kind of human

[01:41:55.310 --> 01:41:58.270]
and all of a sudden as the years go by one or the other.

[01:41:58.270 --> 01:42:03.050]
I mean if it's both I guess it's a much different one of the other starts getting really nasty

[01:42:03.050 --> 01:42:04.770]
and sloppy and smelly.

[01:42:04.950 --> 01:42:05.910]
Oh yeah.

[01:42:06.210 --> 01:42:09.370]
And nobody wants to say anything but boy you really stink and already you can lose

[01:42:09.370 --> 01:42:11.830]
like a couple a hundred pounds.

[01:42:13.510 --> 01:42:17.650]
Don't tell me that when those couples are like bed and down there at night in the same

[01:42:18.270 --> 01:42:22.290]
bed on the same actress within proximity close enough to even touch each other don't

[01:42:22.290 --> 01:42:25.370]
tell me that one of them is thinking oh gee are we going to do this again?

[01:42:25.630 --> 01:42:26.590]
Oh no.

[01:42:26.590 --> 01:42:27.710]
Am I right?

[01:42:28.470 --> 01:42:29.350]
I would imagine.

[01:42:30.850 --> 01:42:33.350]
I mean that's not what you want to do you don't want that Russian girlfriend of yours

[01:42:33.350 --> 01:42:37.190]
getting fat and sloppy and so I lay down the law with the ladies that I did.

[01:42:37.370 --> 01:42:39.590]
You lay down with the ladies well that's the idea isn't it?

[01:42:39.650 --> 01:42:42.930]
Well I lay down the law meaning I tell them like hey listen you know I mean you're the

[01:42:42.930 --> 01:42:45.710]
guy and if you get if you gain like ten pounds you're out.

[01:42:45.830 --> 01:42:46.870]
I'll be looking for somebody else.

[01:42:47.290 --> 01:42:48.050]
Well that's good.

[01:42:48.630 --> 01:42:48.970]
That's good.

[01:42:49.090 --> 01:42:51.550]
I think it's fair I mean I stay in decent shape you know.

[01:42:51.650 --> 01:42:52.490]
No you don't.

[01:42:52.490 --> 01:42:53.130]
You're going to be fat.

[01:42:53.330 --> 01:42:55.290]
I'm telling you I've told you I've been warning you of that ever since I've known

[01:42:55.290 --> 01:42:55.510]
you.

[01:42:55.510 --> 01:42:58.430]
Well look at all this and I got an idea let's make a deal.

[01:42:58.570 --> 01:43:01.530]
Yeah if I'm not fat by what age I'm in the will.

[01:43:05.010 --> 01:43:06.350]
What is it?

[01:43:06.790 --> 01:43:08.650]
Oh man.

[01:43:09.210 --> 01:43:10.510]
But third man.

[01:43:10.810 --> 01:43:14.110]
Alright deal you're in the will everybody with this will business okay.

[01:43:16.090 --> 01:43:17.230]
I do love you though.

[01:43:18.250 --> 01:43:18.950]
Back at you buddy.

[01:43:19.350 --> 01:43:19.550]
Yeah.

[01:43:20.110 --> 01:43:20.630]
Not.

[01:43:21.050 --> 01:43:21.970]
Love it all three.

[01:43:23.270 --> 01:43:24.150]
Oh no.

[01:43:24.610 --> 01:43:27.650]
I got to get my music ready for the ball game in 1250.

[01:43:28.110 --> 01:43:28.830]
A half an hour.

[01:43:29.810 --> 01:43:34.790]
Barley Jones gets his man baby I should have spilled Ross from Channel so nothing like

[01:43:34.790 --> 01:43:35.230]
being old.

[01:43:35.510 --> 01:43:37.850]
Remember all these old and most of our dead too.

[01:43:38.730 --> 01:43:41.990]
I don't want to say that I'm getting modeling my old age but I was thinking yesterday I was

[01:43:41.990 --> 01:43:46.590]
sitting around eating something eating way too much and I was thinking about all my good

[01:43:46.590 --> 01:43:48.370]
friends through my life to my whole not dead.

[01:43:50.070 --> 01:43:52.910]
Well you say that very carefully but that's not a good thing.

[01:43:53.130 --> 01:43:54.970]
I know it's not going to be.

[01:43:54.970 --> 01:43:54.970]

[01:43:55.430 --> 01:43:57.770]
Well yeah the way you said it was very insensitive.

[01:43:58.010 --> 01:43:58.010]

[01:43:58.450 --> 01:43:59.310]
When you get older.

[01:43:59.610 --> 01:44:00.230]
He's laughing.

[01:44:00.350 --> 01:44:04.250]
I thought he's laughing I mean now because I'm an old fart and all my friends are dead

[01:44:04.250 --> 01:44:05.930]
now at least I'm still here you know.

[01:44:06.050 --> 01:44:06.610]
No it's not good.

[01:44:06.750 --> 01:44:07.770]
Actually he's laughing with you.

[01:44:07.990 --> 01:44:07.990]

[01:44:08.050 --> 01:44:09.310]
No he's not he's laughing at me.

[01:44:09.410 --> 01:44:09.630]
No I'm not.

[01:44:10.610 --> 01:44:11.010]
He's laughing.

[01:44:12.030 --> 01:44:12.610]
He's laughing.

[01:44:12.750 --> 01:44:14.310]
He wouldn't laugh at you.

[01:44:14.410 --> 01:44:14.990]
He'll never get in the will.

[01:44:15.550 --> 01:44:16.150]
Yeah that's right.

[01:44:16.290 --> 01:44:16.830]
You're out.

[01:44:17.130 --> 01:44:17.770]
You're already out.

[01:44:17.770 --> 01:44:19.690]
If you want to get back in you better take that back.

[01:44:19.730 --> 01:44:20.770]
Go to his dad and words in Elizabeth.

[01:44:20.890 --> 01:44:21.710]
Now we have it.

[01:44:21.770 --> 01:44:22.590]
Let's try again.

[01:44:22.770 --> 01:44:24.250]
Let's say first welcome to all of you.

[01:44:24.250 --> 01:44:25.030]
Welcome to all of you.

[01:44:25.230 --> 01:44:25.230]

[01:44:25.230 --> 01:44:26.250]
He's Chapel Hill North Carolina.

[01:44:26.570 --> 01:44:27.510]
We're all the mugwumps are.

[01:44:28.150 --> 01:44:28.950]
I'll get around while I leave.

[01:44:28.950 --> 01:44:30.210]
He just leaves me with a bit of a...

[01:44:30.210 --> 01:44:31.050]
Man that's a good angle.

[01:44:31.090 --> 01:44:31.590]
This is a good angle.

[01:44:31.730 --> 01:44:36.430]
This is a place 30 years ago this summer where we had our wedding reception.

[01:44:36.550 --> 01:44:37.170]
Isn't that lovely?

[01:44:37.350 --> 01:44:37.790]
That's a place.

[01:44:37.790 --> 01:44:38.950]
This is a place it's very familiar.

[01:44:39.350 --> 01:44:40.250]
Yeah very familiar.

[01:44:40.850 --> 01:44:42.650]
We'll just say what you're going to say and get it over with.

[01:44:42.650 --> 01:44:45.410]
Now what's happened with Elizabeth and what's happened with her?

[01:44:45.730 --> 01:44:46.750]
With a health situation.

[01:44:46.750 --> 01:44:48.270]
Now let's hear about her breast.

[01:44:49.330 --> 01:44:50.590]
Monday of this week.

[01:44:50.590 --> 01:44:55.690]
Elizabeth went to the doctor because she felt a pain on her left side.

[01:44:57.290 --> 01:44:59.450]
She went in at X-rays taken.

[01:45:00.190 --> 01:45:05.490]
The result of the X-rays showed that she may have a fracture on the left side.

[01:45:07.570 --> 01:45:08.370]
There's something that looks suspicious.

[01:45:08.370 --> 01:45:08.990]
Oh my God.

[01:45:09.050 --> 01:45:09.930]
It's a rib on the right.

[01:45:09.970 --> 01:45:10.650]
Oh suspicious.

[01:45:11.370 --> 01:45:12.510]
I was in Iowa at the time.

[01:45:12.650 --> 01:45:13.290]
She was called on.

[01:45:13.390 --> 01:45:13.710]
She used to.

[01:45:13.710 --> 01:45:15.670]
She said I was in Iowa at the time.

[01:45:15.810 --> 01:45:20.550]
I called me and said that they wanted to follow a test yesterday.

[01:45:20.990 --> 01:45:21.610]
Get to it man.

[01:45:22.230 --> 01:45:26.130]
So I came back from Iowa on Tuesday night.

[01:45:27.070 --> 01:45:27.570]
Tuesday night.

[01:45:27.910 --> 01:45:29.830]
We went in to the hospital here at Chapel Hill.

[01:45:30.010 --> 01:45:30.190]
Yeah.

[01:45:30.410 --> 01:45:31.670]
And for the test done.

[01:45:31.750 --> 01:45:32.610]
What a Yahoo man.

[01:45:32.810 --> 01:45:34.450]
What a bone stripping was done.

[01:45:34.710 --> 01:45:34.870]
Yeah.

[01:45:35.230 --> 01:45:42.630]
That study actually made the suspicion about the rib on the right side more intense.

[01:45:42.630 --> 01:45:44.970]
There was more concern about it.

[01:45:45.770 --> 01:45:48.970]
And as a result there was a boxy done of that section.

[01:45:49.070 --> 01:45:49.490]
Oh oh.

[01:45:49.530 --> 01:45:50.470]
A rib on the right side.

[01:45:51.150 --> 01:45:53.710]
The boxy showed that the cancer had returned.

[01:45:53.850 --> 01:45:54.270]
Oh oh.

[01:45:54.350 --> 01:45:55.310]
It was malignant.

[01:45:55.530 --> 01:45:55.890]
Uh oh.

[01:45:55.990 --> 01:46:00.730]
And later in the day we did a CT scan which was done.

[01:46:00.730 --> 01:46:03.350]
How many of those are cascades in the same thing in the soft tissue?

[01:46:03.390 --> 01:46:06.370]
The bone study and it looked at her hard tissue.

[01:46:06.990 --> 01:46:10.010]
The CT scan showed very little.

[01:46:10.350 --> 01:46:10.750]
Oh well.

[01:46:10.750 --> 01:46:17.270]
And so the net result of all the tests is that she has her cancer is back.

[01:46:17.550 --> 01:46:20.690]
Uh it's largely confined.

[01:46:21.270 --> 01:46:21.810]
It's confined.

[01:46:21.990 --> 01:46:22.870]
I can't take anymore him.

[01:46:22.930 --> 01:46:25.970]
He'll tell us they're all black in the run because he's going to take care of her.

[01:46:26.050 --> 01:46:26.610]
He's not going to run.

[01:46:26.890 --> 01:46:27.590]
And that's good news.

[01:46:27.970 --> 01:46:29.190]
23 pass noon at QA.

[01:46:30.010 --> 01:46:31.530]
Hi Junior honey.

[01:46:32.850 --> 01:46:35.510]
Who you have what it takes to be a news will.

[01:46:35.870 --> 01:46:37.370]
If you do you will.

[01:46:37.370 --> 01:46:45.350]
Sport whole radio 560 WQA and bike you who listen and wave with the 560 QAM Niels wheel contest.

[01:46:45.650 --> 01:46:50.290]
Simply cut and face someone else's profile and take to my space or in 50 words or less.

[01:46:50.450 --> 01:46:53.090]
Right why you should be a Niels wheel on the back of the postcard.

[01:46:53.250 --> 01:46:56.210]
It's ended to WQAMs through the L's in the McAllister hotel.

[01:46:56.710 --> 01:46:58.290]
Then when you hear this sound.

[01:46:59.250 --> 01:47:03.910]
That's your chance to win Harris millions for half-event billions of dollars.

[01:47:07.250 --> 01:47:08.750]
Oh contestants must be male.

[01:47:08.870 --> 01:47:11.990]
No younger than 18 no older than 25 must be shaman and smooth.

[01:47:12.350 --> 01:47:17.030]
Judges reserved the right to eliminate contestants faced on the rainy quay and similarity rate from scale of 1 to 10.

[01:47:17.190 --> 01:47:20.370]
Runners I will receive an autographed duplicate of Niels wheel suitable for training.

[01:47:20.650 --> 01:47:24.710]
And the duplicates of Niels wheel found on the original WQA in the parking level before it did by law.

[01:47:24.910 --> 01:47:29.050]
All prizes will be awarded by my clamping and the grand prize winners are asked to be patient for it.

[01:47:29.150 --> 01:47:31.410]
And if in a period of time until Niels decides to die.

[01:47:31.410 --> 01:47:33.890]
From 29 at 5.60 WQAM.

[01:47:34.150 --> 01:47:35.270]
I'm dying on the way.

[01:47:35.270 --> 01:47:40.010]
Twenty-one minutes before the modern pregame show Marlins and the Cardinals from Jupiter baby that's out of this world.

[01:47:40.350 --> 01:47:41.530]
So the beast is the one that gave us.

[01:47:41.770 --> 01:47:44.270]
So we've got all kinds of information about Allens and that picnic.

[01:47:44.490 --> 01:47:45.030]
What is it, Vyner?

[01:47:45.650 --> 01:47:46.690]
Yeah, it's over across the street.

[01:47:46.990 --> 01:47:49.530]
And while life is a picnic man, you bring the ants in your pants.

[01:47:50.130 --> 01:47:50.990]
So what's the story here?

[01:47:51.050 --> 01:47:52.230]
The struggles already in our lives.

[01:47:52.830 --> 01:47:56.830]
And we know from our previous experience that when this happens you have a choice.

[01:47:56.830 --> 01:48:05.470]
You can go coward in the corner and hide or you can be tough and go out there and stand up for what you believe in.

[01:48:05.970 --> 01:48:08.830]
And both of us are committed to the calls.

[01:48:09.070 --> 01:48:12.010]
We're committed to changing this country that we love so much.

[01:48:12.110 --> 01:48:13.310]
Somebody are trying to say John.

[01:48:13.490 --> 01:48:15.210]
We have no intention of cowering in the corner.

[01:48:17.130 --> 01:48:18.530]
Do you have any idea what that means?

[01:48:18.750 --> 01:48:18.870]
No.

[01:48:19.130 --> 01:48:19.270]
No.

[01:48:19.490 --> 01:48:19.990]
He's going to run.

[01:48:20.130 --> 01:48:23.210]
Maybe I drive this here during the break and I just gave me a headache.

[01:48:23.670 --> 01:48:23.870]
Yeah.

[01:48:23.870 --> 01:48:26.030]
He's just with that Phil Sim is drawn.

[01:48:26.190 --> 01:48:26.690]
You know that phone.

[01:48:26.770 --> 01:48:26.930]
Yeah.

[01:48:26.930 --> 01:48:27.890]
The sideline.

[01:48:27.910 --> 01:48:29.210]
The 50 eyed line.

[01:48:29.350 --> 01:48:30.130]
Oh God.

[01:48:30.130 --> 01:48:30.890]
Do I hate that?

[01:48:30.950 --> 01:48:33.190]
Macarver and Phil Sim need to be on the same plane.

[01:48:33.190 --> 01:48:34.950]
It needs to crash before 1 o'clock.

[01:48:34.950 --> 01:48:35.870]
I'm telling you that right now.

[01:48:35.950 --> 01:48:39.130]
Tim Macarver and Phil Sim need to be on the same plane right now.

[01:48:39.330 --> 01:48:41.270]
And but I'm being chocked that thing down.

[01:48:41.390 --> 01:48:43.250]
If we get the old Chris Collins worth on that same.

[01:48:43.390 --> 01:48:44.030]
Oh my god.

[01:48:44.430 --> 01:48:44.530]
Jesus.

[01:48:44.950 --> 01:48:45.450]
Real fast.

[01:48:45.670 --> 01:48:47.130]
And don't forget about Sterling Sharp.

[01:48:47.410 --> 01:48:48.790]
Is it Sterling Sharp or Shannon Sharp?

[01:48:48.970 --> 01:48:49.370]
No, Shannon.

[01:48:49.930 --> 01:48:50.730]
Shannon Sharp.

[01:48:50.910 --> 01:48:51.650]
Is Shannon Sharp?

[01:48:51.850 --> 01:48:52.610]
Absolutely not.

[01:48:53.730 --> 01:48:55.090]
Speak a little English, Shannon.

[01:48:55.210 --> 01:48:55.430]
Okay.

[01:48:55.610 --> 01:48:57.550]
And click there with a Pimp Outfit like Dion Sanders.

[01:48:57.730 --> 01:48:59.010]
Neon V on what was Pimp Outfit?

[01:48:59.490 --> 01:49:01.270]
Pimp in the pre-game show.

[01:49:02.750 --> 01:49:04.010]
1115 votes on a poll by way.

[01:49:04.150 --> 01:49:04.810]
Pretty heavy duty.

[01:49:06.610 --> 01:49:06.970]
WQAM.

[01:49:07.110 --> 01:49:07.250]
Hello.

[01:49:08.610 --> 01:49:08.970]
Billy.

[01:49:09.610 --> 01:49:10.110]
Yes sir.

[01:49:10.290 --> 01:49:11.150]
Happy Thursday sir.

[01:49:11.270 --> 01:49:11.670]
Back to you.

[01:49:12.010 --> 01:49:14.090]
And Greg's on your anniversary there.

[01:49:14.190 --> 01:49:14.670]
Kissy kissy.

[01:49:15.230 --> 01:49:16.330]
And as you wanted to make your way.

[01:49:16.450 --> 01:49:16.610]
Yeah.

[01:49:16.710 --> 01:49:17.310]
You know the low night.

[01:49:17.490 --> 01:49:18.670]
Do remember what were.

[01:49:19.210 --> 01:49:21.630]
I grew up in New York and you know I think they went belly up.

[01:49:21.630 --> 01:49:22.390]
I'm not mistaken.

[01:49:22.450 --> 01:49:23.230]
Oh, a long time ago.

[01:49:23.350 --> 01:49:24.450]
And Eisner is five in dime?

[01:49:25.550 --> 01:49:26.410]
No, I do not.

[01:49:26.610 --> 01:49:28.010]
I grew up half my life in New York.

[01:49:28.590 --> 01:49:29.130]
What a shame.

[01:49:29.790 --> 01:49:32.290]
Well in any event I'm also that picture you were talking about with the.

[01:49:33.090 --> 01:49:35.050]
The that they just try to also believe her.

[01:49:35.110 --> 01:49:36.790]
And then is there a link on it on your website?

[01:49:37.890 --> 01:49:39.270]
Is there a link on our website?

[01:49:39.550 --> 01:49:39.750]
No.

[01:49:40.050 --> 01:49:40.270]
No.

[01:49:40.510 --> 01:49:40.510]

[01:49:40.630 --> 01:49:41.430]
You want the.

[01:49:41.930 --> 01:49:42.870]
You want the site?

[01:49:43.390 --> 01:49:43.770]
Yes, please.

[01:49:45.050 --> 01:49:45.950]
I have no idea.

[01:49:46.070 --> 01:49:46.950]
Well here I got it somewhere.

[01:49:47.090 --> 01:49:47.730]
It's DR.

[01:49:48.250 --> 01:49:48.610]
DR.

[01:49:49.070 --> 01:49:49.390]
Dr.

[01:49:50.550 --> 01:49:50.870]
Pupik.

[01:49:51.070 --> 01:49:51.150]
Dr.

[01:49:51.410 --> 01:49:51.970]
I don't know.

[01:49:52.150 --> 01:49:53.090]
I'll dig through my stuff.

[01:49:53.150 --> 01:49:53.770]
I'll put it on the ear.

[01:49:54.250 --> 01:49:54.570]
Okay.

[01:49:54.950 --> 01:49:56.130]
You have a sweet and have a sweet day.

[01:49:56.510 --> 01:49:56.790]
You too.

[01:49:57.090 --> 01:49:57.270]
Bye bye.

[01:49:57.710 --> 01:49:57.950]
Okay.

[01:49:58.210 --> 01:49:59.770]
I guess I'm going to have to find that.

[01:50:00.690 --> 01:50:02.170]
I guess I'm going to be one.

[01:50:04.210 --> 01:50:06.250]
Well the way Chris presented to me.

[01:50:06.330 --> 01:50:07.930]
I thought it was going to be something really grotesque of this.

[01:50:08.010 --> 01:50:09.290]
Well, it's in a way it is.

[01:50:09.550 --> 01:50:10.470]
But it's you know.

[01:50:10.850 --> 01:50:14.550]
I mean if you start digging around inside the human body it's not like what you call really appetizing.

[01:50:14.650 --> 01:50:14.910]
I'm sure.

[01:50:15.490 --> 01:50:15.710]
No.

[01:50:16.270 --> 01:50:16.590]
Oh.

[01:50:17.750 --> 01:50:19.130]
How'd you like to be one of those guys?

[01:50:20.890 --> 01:50:22.550]
That does the autopsy, the corner.

[01:50:23.410 --> 01:50:23.830]
I'm good.

[01:50:25.570 --> 01:50:26.050]
Let's see.

[01:50:26.330 --> 01:50:26.610]
Are you?

[01:50:27.210 --> 01:50:27.810]
Not what I heard.

[01:50:29.250 --> 01:50:29.570]
Okay.

[01:50:29.690 --> 01:50:29.990]
Let's see.

[01:50:30.110 --> 01:50:32.110]
Let me just get back on this right space here.

[01:50:33.870 --> 01:50:36.490]
See I'm doing this just for that guy because nobody else is going to want to know.

[01:50:36.570 --> 01:50:37.050]
But that's okay.

[01:50:37.170 --> 01:50:38.010]
Being a good guy that I am.

[01:50:38.410 --> 01:50:41.010]
Let me get to my male thing here and find out what the hell that was.

[01:50:43.790 --> 01:50:44.550]
Where is it?

[01:50:44.550 --> 01:50:45.550]
There it is.

[01:50:46.690 --> 01:50:48.870]
V-R-N-A-T-U-R-A.

[01:50:49.630 --> 01:50:50.350]
DrNature.com.

[01:50:50.410 --> 01:50:50.850]
It's all one word.

[01:50:50.990 --> 01:50:52.290]
D-R-N-A-T-U-R-A.

[01:50:52.950 --> 01:50:53.670]
DrNature.com.

[01:50:56.010 --> 01:50:57.210]
Discussing and yet amazing.

[01:50:57.450 --> 01:50:58.150]
I think you're right Chris.

[01:50:58.390 --> 01:50:59.430]
It's discussing and it's amazing.

[01:50:59.610 --> 01:51:00.230]
All those parasites.

[01:51:00.550 --> 01:51:02.030]
All that stuff inside you man.

[01:51:02.630 --> 01:51:03.490]
All that tapeworm.

[01:51:03.610 --> 01:51:05.770]
And that's why you've got to keep running the bastard robins.

[01:51:05.850 --> 01:51:09.010]
They're running to the red turd pharmacy there.

[01:51:09.530 --> 01:51:10.430]
They're running across the street.

[01:51:10.450 --> 01:51:11.370]
You get to a banana split.

[01:51:11.610 --> 01:51:13.850]
I haven't had a banana split in about a hundred years.

[01:51:13.850 --> 01:51:15.470]
That's the last thing I need.

[01:51:15.630 --> 01:51:16.110]
But you know something?

[01:51:16.410 --> 01:51:19.730]
After you've forced all that rocky road on me today.

[01:51:20.270 --> 01:51:21.170]
Yeah, my bad.

[01:51:21.630 --> 01:51:22.030]
Yeah.

[01:51:22.270 --> 01:51:23.570]
Well, you know how easy I am.

[01:51:23.810 --> 01:51:24.410]
I've got to do this.

[01:51:24.610 --> 01:51:26.050]
I do have to think about that stuff.

[01:51:26.050 --> 01:51:27.190]
And I'm like, oh, you know.

[01:51:28.670 --> 01:51:29.830]
It's like Brady Quinn.

[01:51:29.970 --> 01:51:32.490]
I think I do is just mention all those pictures we have on our website.

[01:51:32.650 --> 01:51:33.150]
Nearly naked.

[01:51:33.250 --> 01:51:33.570]
And I think.

[01:51:34.570 --> 01:51:35.230]
Like that.

[01:51:36.110 --> 01:51:36.870]
Just thinking.

[01:51:37.130 --> 01:51:37.850]
Just thinking out loud.

[01:51:37.950 --> 01:51:39.110]
What's wrong with thinking out loud, huh?

[01:51:39.750 --> 01:51:40.330]
What would you rather be?

[01:51:40.530 --> 01:51:41.150]
Stinking or thinking?

[01:51:41.750 --> 01:51:42.050]
Thinking.

[01:51:42.710 --> 01:51:43.550]
Now, here's one.

[01:51:43.750 --> 01:51:46.110]
Also, I forgot who sent this from my space.

[01:51:46.250 --> 01:51:47.230]
It said, just listen to your show.

[01:51:47.410 --> 01:51:48.890]
I can do everything or land or buy the internet.

[01:51:49.450 --> 01:51:50.470]
I'm going to tell you one thing.

[01:51:50.590 --> 01:51:51.190]
I'm at my space.

[01:51:51.190 --> 01:51:52.070]
There's a whole lot of people.

[01:51:52.230 --> 01:51:52.850]
Where's Harry Potter?

[01:51:53.030 --> 01:51:55.270]
Where's that Zoltan, Zurktech, whatever that guy is doing?

[01:51:55.430 --> 01:51:56.250]
Where are all those people?

[01:51:57.090 --> 01:51:59.010]
Where's my nephew, David, for crank out loud?

[01:51:59.430 --> 01:52:00.350]
I don't know if he's really my nephew.

[01:52:00.530 --> 01:52:01.270]
He's my cousin's son.

[01:52:01.370 --> 01:52:02.190]
Would that make him a my nephew?

[01:52:03.370 --> 01:52:03.970]
I don't think so.

[01:52:04.630 --> 01:52:05.450]
Well, whatever he is.

[01:52:06.710 --> 01:52:09.230]
Somebody please tell your management that nobody cares about the Marlins.

[01:52:09.370 --> 01:52:10.930]
Let alone frequent spring training games.

[01:52:10.930 --> 01:52:13.110]
It says, blah, says whoever sent this.

[01:52:13.390 --> 01:52:15.790]
Anyways, it says I tried calling you while I'm on my lunch break,

[01:52:16.050 --> 01:52:17.070]
but you weren't answering the phone.

[01:52:17.230 --> 01:52:18.250]
Well, I have a habit of doing that.

[01:52:18.810 --> 01:52:21.450]
Another great fast food restaurant, South Florida, does not have,

[01:52:21.730 --> 01:52:23.750]
but Tampa and Orlando do is they pita pit.

[01:52:24.490 --> 01:52:26.110]
Oh, man, the pita pit.

[01:52:26.390 --> 01:52:27.010]
Never heard of it.

[01:52:27.130 --> 01:52:27.710]
Neither me either.

[01:52:28.410 --> 01:52:31.310]
It says the food is amazing and made before your eyes.

[01:52:31.390 --> 01:52:33.970]
I like when it gets made before your eyes and the food too.

[01:52:34.550 --> 01:52:36.830]
You decide what meat you want, chicken, staker, ham.

[01:52:37.070 --> 01:52:39.850]
They grill it and then add whatever veggies, cheese, sauces you want,

[01:52:39.850 --> 01:52:41.690]
and put it in the pita wrap it up for you.

[01:52:42.690 --> 01:52:44.710]
You can eat it 12 times a day, not get tired of it.

[01:52:44.930 --> 01:52:47.830]
It actually started in Canada and there might be some locations near you.

[01:52:48.170 --> 01:52:49.490]
Check it out at pitapick.com.

[01:52:49.610 --> 01:52:51.030]
You'll love it and have a good day, Palli.

[01:52:51.090 --> 01:52:52.150]
You too, and at the end it says,

[01:52:53.030 --> 01:52:54.610]
like that, love that going around.

[01:52:57.530 --> 01:52:59.130]
Oh, they're slapping each other now.

[01:52:59.130 --> 01:52:59.950]
They're playing.

[01:53:00.110 --> 01:53:02.130]
They're hosin around, John and Elizabeth Edwards there.

[01:53:02.630 --> 01:53:04.790]
Maybe a week from this, maybe a week ago, exactly now.

[01:53:04.870 --> 01:53:05.870]
Yeah, they're slapping.

[01:53:05.930 --> 01:53:08.610]
Yesterday was not a good day for us, but they're high five and low five,

[01:53:08.610 --> 01:53:09.950]
and she slapped them on the knee cap.

[01:53:09.950 --> 01:53:10.910]
We're very close to it.

[01:53:11.070 --> 01:53:12.030]
She said, ain't nothing there.

[01:53:12.910 --> 01:53:14.590]
And then she hit them on the side of the head and said,

[01:53:14.590 --> 01:53:15.470]
oh, ain't nothing there either.

[01:53:16.610 --> 01:53:18.610]
I mean, the idea that he thinks he's going to be the president.

[01:53:18.790 --> 01:53:20.890]
That's just, I mean, it would be like George Bush being the president.

[01:53:21.610 --> 01:53:25.630]
Some deep south, Yahoo, you know, all of being improvement though.

[01:53:26.190 --> 01:53:26.290]
Yeah.

[01:53:26.830 --> 01:53:30.590]
1125 votes on the pool, which medical exam or procedure causes you the most anxiety.

[01:53:30.890 --> 01:53:33.150]
Causes high anxiety, baby.

[01:53:35.450 --> 01:53:38.290]
See, I'm one of those people I don't mind any of it.

[01:53:39.690 --> 01:53:41.830]
I guess when you get old enough and you've had all those procedures,

[01:53:41.830 --> 01:53:44.410]
and they've, like that run away bride, you know,

[01:53:44.790 --> 01:53:47.090]
and they probe you, poke you remember that bit at the end?

[01:53:47.350 --> 01:53:47.830]
I love that bit.

[01:53:48.170 --> 01:53:49.530]
Yeah, I think that's coming up.

[01:53:51.190 --> 01:53:53.290]
Proctological exam, finger up the old rectum,

[01:53:54.130 --> 01:53:57.590]
or maybe not all that old, 370 gets people very nervous.

[01:53:58.750 --> 01:54:00.110]
Root canal 162.

[01:54:00.270 --> 01:54:03.290]
I hate this pool, 128, 11.3%, well, your mama.

[01:54:03.670 --> 01:54:05.090]
So socks and hell, how do you like that?

[01:54:05.790 --> 01:54:07.970]
Tooth extraction 82 dental exam 75,

[01:54:08.310 --> 01:54:09.410]
giving a blood sample 57.

[01:54:09.990 --> 01:54:11.810]
That's where you find who the real whoops is our man.

[01:54:11.850 --> 01:54:13.230]
Hey, calm down, buddy.

[01:54:13.870 --> 01:54:15.790]
You can't handle that when you look at it long enough.

[01:54:15.870 --> 01:54:16.770]
He said that I can't handle it.

[01:54:17.190 --> 01:54:20.490]
It doesn't bother me to look at it or hurt or anything,

[01:54:20.610 --> 01:54:25.270]
but I tend to faint for some reason when the needle goes in the arm.

[01:54:25.310 --> 01:54:26.210]
What a whos.

[01:54:26.330 --> 01:54:28.730]
I know, hey, I have a little man, but I do hate needle.

[01:54:28.730 --> 01:54:32.270]
I do get really from Chris, man, when you get ready to stick it and he passes out.

[01:54:32.410 --> 01:54:33.390]
Which is probably pretty good.

[01:54:33.390 --> 01:54:35.170]
But that was Josh, that's like, that was me.

[01:54:35.810 --> 01:54:36.450]
Well, who did I say?

[01:54:36.730 --> 01:54:37.150]
You said me.

[01:54:37.930 --> 01:54:38.790]
Let's blame it on Chris.

[01:54:39.110 --> 01:54:40.010]
Yes, Chris is well.

[01:54:40.110 --> 01:54:40.870]
Yeah, I think my call.

[01:54:42.230 --> 01:54:46.690]
I'm going to tell you that's pretty, if you have somebody that likes who's a sadist,

[01:54:46.790 --> 01:54:50.450]
you know, if you have a dental dog, a hygienist who wants to inflict a lot of pain

[01:54:50.450 --> 01:54:52.970]
and make you bleed a lot, they can really cause you a lot of pain.

[01:54:53.330 --> 01:54:54.210]
Dental cleaning 57.

[01:54:55.050 --> 01:54:56.530]
Giving a stool sample 39.

[01:54:57.330 --> 01:54:59.950]
And then you take that stool, put it over the counter-right by Alan's drugs

[01:54:59.950 --> 01:55:01.510]
and sit down, have you a nice banana split?

[01:55:02.610 --> 01:55:04.270]
Routine medical checkup 34.

[01:55:04.890 --> 01:55:05.870]
Treadmill test 31.

[01:55:06.330 --> 01:55:07.450]
Gyneological exam 31.

[01:55:07.690 --> 01:55:08.990]
Getting a shot, he had a 16.

[01:55:09.250 --> 01:55:09.750]
Getting a shot.

[01:55:10.730 --> 01:55:11.770]
Like a flu shot.

[01:55:12.070 --> 01:55:13.550]
Back to the needles again, you know.

[01:55:13.790 --> 01:55:14.750]
The needle walks in quickly.

[01:55:15.750 --> 01:55:16.630]
I exam 14.

[01:55:16.790 --> 01:55:17.930]
Giving a urine sample 11.

[01:55:17.970 --> 01:55:19.050]
That's for all you drug use out there.

[01:55:19.470 --> 01:55:22.670]
All pan, if you're worried about the urine sample, we know what you've been doing.

[01:55:23.970 --> 01:55:26.050]
An EKG 10 and a breast exam 10.

[01:55:28.610 --> 01:55:31.650]
While here's what's on it, where it says the key is to keep your head up.

[01:55:31.710 --> 01:55:34.370]
Man, that's my idea, keep your head up.

[01:55:35.610 --> 01:55:38.410]
1237, we got the Marlon pregame show in 13 minutes, but who's counting?

[01:55:38.490 --> 01:55:38.970]
Now what music?

[01:55:39.190 --> 01:55:40.330]
We're moving out!

[01:55:40.890 --> 01:55:42.150]
See George is out sick today.

[01:55:42.530 --> 01:55:43.810]
He get upset if I play that.

[01:55:45.830 --> 01:55:47.290]
He says he doesn't hate that theme.

[01:55:47.610 --> 01:55:50.530]
Oh, he hates that show, but I think the theme is fine.

[01:55:51.630 --> 01:55:54.610]
And it's labeled wrong on his disc.

[01:55:58.530 --> 01:55:59.990]
So the wrong number on here.

[01:56:04.110 --> 01:56:05.750]
It's said, cut 31 is the Jefferson.

[01:56:07.090 --> 01:56:09.630]
That sounds very much like the good time.

[01:56:11.130 --> 01:56:12.250]
Or no, that is the Jefferson.

[01:56:12.370 --> 01:56:13.270]
Yeah, what are you talking about?

[01:56:14.030 --> 01:56:16.490]
We got confused with me too.

[01:56:20.790 --> 01:56:23.510]
I love the Jefferson's and the theme song from the Jefferson's.

[01:56:23.510 --> 01:56:25.350]
But good times, I love the theme and I hate the show.

[01:56:25.510 --> 01:56:26.130]
Oh, it's so bad.

[01:56:26.830 --> 01:56:27.850]
Let's all watch Esther Roll.

[01:56:28.450 --> 01:56:31.770]
On Easter, on Easter Sunday, we can take her to the White House lawn and watch Esther Roll.

[01:56:32.170 --> 01:56:33.710]
Along with that bitch on the adventure Del Ray there.

[01:56:36.990 --> 01:56:38.150]
Hello, my friends.

[01:56:38.650 --> 01:56:40.290]
I'm a big hello.

[01:56:41.510 --> 01:56:41.910]
Hello?

[01:56:43.690 --> 01:56:44.090]
Hello?

[01:56:44.930 --> 01:56:45.470]
The Anapur.

[01:56:46.990 --> 01:56:48.750]
What the hell's the matter, honey?

[01:56:49.350 --> 01:56:51.910]
I think you're right.

[01:56:52.710 --> 01:56:54.570]
You sound like you're crying.

[01:56:54.670 --> 01:56:56.770]
I think you're not by aliens.

[01:56:57.310 --> 01:56:58.630]
You've been kidnapped again?

[01:56:59.430 --> 01:57:00.750]
By aliens.

[01:57:02.310 --> 01:57:03.990]
You've been kidnapped by aliens?

[01:57:04.850 --> 01:57:06.530]
Where they don't tuck you?

[01:57:08.770 --> 01:57:09.430]
Albuquerque.

[01:57:11.490 --> 01:57:12.150]
Albuquerque.

[01:57:12.230 --> 01:57:13.870]
Is that an America?

[01:57:15.190 --> 01:57:15.750]
Where is it?

[01:57:15.950 --> 01:57:16.490]
In New Mexico.

[01:57:17.010 --> 01:57:17.230]
Where?

[01:57:17.610 --> 01:57:18.190]
New Mexico.

[01:57:18.730 --> 01:57:19.670]
Albuquerque is.

[01:57:19.910 --> 01:57:20.050]
Yeah.

[01:57:20.050 --> 01:57:20.930]
I was in Georgia.

[01:57:21.190 --> 01:57:21.870]
No, no, no, Mexico.

[01:57:22.070 --> 01:57:22.390]
Okay.

[01:57:24.410 --> 01:57:25.910]
I don't believe you, honey.

[01:57:26.110 --> 01:57:27.470]
You don't have to lie to me.

[01:57:27.670 --> 01:57:29.210]
No, I want to get married.

[01:57:29.210 --> 01:57:31.510]
I really do it just that I was kidnapped by aliens.

[01:57:31.970 --> 01:57:33.090]
Oh, I believe you, honey.

[01:57:33.330 --> 01:57:34.290]
They got short hair.

[01:57:34.830 --> 01:57:35.630]
They got short hair.

[01:57:35.730 --> 01:57:36.050]
Who does?

[01:57:37.470 --> 01:57:38.790]
The aliens have short hair.

[01:57:38.950 --> 01:57:39.930]
Oh, and you say short hair?

[01:57:40.010 --> 01:57:41.530]
You mean like Ryan C. Crest Short?

[01:57:41.790 --> 01:57:42.990]
Oh, longer than that.

[01:57:43.590 --> 01:57:45.230]
A little longer like Fabio.

[01:57:45.850 --> 01:57:47.590]
They're different than they get short hair.

[01:57:47.590 --> 01:57:49.450]
All right, honey, don't get elected.

[01:57:49.990 --> 01:57:50.970]
I believe you.

[01:57:51.070 --> 01:57:51.670]
Where are you?

[01:57:51.750 --> 01:57:52.590]
Can I pick you up?

[01:57:52.590 --> 01:57:53.770]
I'm at a 7-11.

[01:57:54.210 --> 01:57:55.130]
7-11?

[01:57:55.430 --> 01:57:55.550]
Yeah.

[01:57:56.030 --> 01:57:57.110]
Can you get me a Slurpee?

[01:57:57.810 --> 01:57:58.170]
What?

[01:57:58.650 --> 01:57:59.130]
Slurpee.

[01:58:00.090 --> 01:58:00.610]
What?

[01:58:01.150 --> 01:58:01.670]
Slurpee.

[01:58:02.150 --> 01:58:02.470]
What?

[01:58:02.870 --> 01:58:03.950]
Like a blueberry wolf.

[01:58:04.830 --> 01:58:06.010]
I just think you're not.

[01:58:06.290 --> 01:58:07.590]
I think it's you a Slurpee.

[01:58:09.710 --> 01:58:11.210]
All right, I'll get it myself.

[01:58:14.710 --> 01:58:16.610]
You really been kidnapped, honey.

[01:58:16.610 --> 01:58:18.850]
I spy aliens in a blue van.

[01:58:19.550 --> 01:58:20.930]
Aliens drive a blue van?

[01:58:21.190 --> 01:58:21.450]
Yes.

[01:58:21.930 --> 01:58:23.110]
Like a Chevy van?

[01:58:23.630 --> 01:58:24.030]
No.

[01:58:24.310 --> 01:58:24.850]
Is it a Ford?

[01:58:25.370 --> 01:58:25.590]
No.

[01:58:26.270 --> 01:58:27.630]
What kind of van is it?

[01:58:28.010 --> 01:58:29.150]
It's a kind of van.

[01:58:31.310 --> 01:58:33.150]
Does they do anything to you?

[01:58:33.990 --> 01:58:35.250]
Is there probes?

[01:58:35.650 --> 01:58:35.870]
No.

[01:58:36.150 --> 01:58:36.490]
Poked?

[01:58:36.750 --> 01:58:37.030]
No.

[01:58:37.190 --> 01:58:37.710]
Proud you?

[01:58:38.030 --> 01:58:38.230]
No.

[01:58:38.670 --> 01:58:39.930]
Like love to you.

[01:58:40.250 --> 01:58:41.090]
No, you idiot!

[01:58:41.610 --> 01:58:42.330]
I'm not coming home.

[01:58:42.430 --> 01:58:43.530]
I'm standing at the 7-11.

[01:58:43.930 --> 01:58:45.310]
You don't want to burn me, do you?

[01:58:45.310 --> 01:58:45.850]
No.

[01:58:46.070 --> 01:58:46.510]
What?

[01:58:46.810 --> 01:58:47.770]
No, I don't.

[01:58:47.870 --> 01:58:49.050]
But I forgive you.

[01:58:49.210 --> 01:58:49.750]
I don't care.

[01:58:50.010 --> 01:58:50.730]
You can come home.

[01:58:50.850 --> 01:58:51.090]
I'm not.

[01:58:51.510 --> 01:58:51.910]
Come home.

[01:58:51.990 --> 01:58:53.070]
I'm done with this sheet.

[01:58:53.250 --> 01:58:53.470]
Bye-bye.

[01:58:53.630 --> 01:58:54.130]
Love you.

[01:58:54.490 --> 01:58:54.970]
Love you.

[01:58:55.690 --> 01:58:56.410]
Love you.

[01:58:58.010 --> 01:58:58.250]
Bye.

[01:58:58.730 --> 01:58:59.170]
Love you.

[01:59:00.550 --> 01:59:01.270]
All right.

[01:59:01.730 --> 01:59:01.910]
Class.

[01:59:01.930 --> 01:59:03.310]
I felt like a nice maiden perkiteru to me.

[01:59:03.830 --> 01:59:04.870]
1135 votes on a pool.

[01:59:05.530 --> 01:59:07.170]
M. Roy, a four minutes and fifty-five seconds

[01:59:07.170 --> 01:59:09.090]
but who's counting away from Marlin's baseball?

[01:59:09.330 --> 01:59:09.990]
Three game.

[01:59:10.110 --> 01:59:10.830]
Exhibition is baseball.

[01:59:11.090 --> 01:59:12.610]
Marlin's in the kernels in Jupiter.

[01:59:13.570 --> 01:59:16.290]
Already got one of my space messages I just read from somebody's read.

[01:59:16.590 --> 01:59:18.330]
He's conducting a ritual.

[01:59:18.470 --> 01:59:19.850]
He's got the sheep and the goats and the chickens.

[01:59:20.170 --> 01:59:22.730]
Trying to get it to rain in Jupiter so that the game will be rained out.

[01:59:22.970 --> 01:59:23.610]
Too late, Pally.

[01:59:23.890 --> 01:59:24.430]
To make any difference.

[01:59:24.770 --> 01:59:25.490]
We're out of here.

[01:59:25.650 --> 01:59:26.590]
We love the Marlins.

[01:59:26.890 --> 01:59:27.610]
We love the Marlins.

[01:59:28.450 --> 01:59:31.310]
On the day games only, especially when they start we get early, like they're today.

[01:59:31.910 --> 01:59:32.750]
That's when we love the Marlins.

[01:59:33.010 --> 01:59:34.970]
Other than that, I'm going to tell you something seriously.

[01:59:35.430 --> 01:59:37.010]
And, you know, you can do whatever you want.

[01:59:37.110 --> 01:59:38.170]
Whether you can stick it wherever you want.

[01:59:38.250 --> 01:59:38.610]
Back home.

[01:59:38.790 --> 01:59:39.550]
But I don't...

[01:59:39.550 --> 01:59:40.070]
I...

[01:59:40.070 --> 01:59:43.410]
The chances of my watching baseball ever again on a scale of anything.

[01:59:43.830 --> 01:59:45.250]
I wouldn't care who was that was playing.

[01:59:45.450 --> 01:59:49.310]
How exciting the game was if they were like 84 to 83 in the first inning.

[01:59:49.430 --> 01:59:50.310]
I wouldn't care, you know.

[01:59:50.390 --> 01:59:50.790]
Demon here.

[01:59:50.870 --> 01:59:53.210]
He's got to learn to play without the puck and he does a real good job.

[01:59:53.410 --> 01:59:53.750]
Oh, it is.

[01:59:53.950 --> 01:59:55.490]
He's back in Probecicle.

[01:59:55.650 --> 01:59:57.030]
One of the sabers in the Washingtonshire.

[01:59:57.090 --> 02:00:00.150]
You don't want to see your boy Barry Bond break the record this year?

[02:00:00.370 --> 02:00:01.330]
I don't want to see anybody.

[02:00:01.470 --> 02:00:03.270]
I don't want to see anybody playing baseball.

[02:00:04.170 --> 02:00:05.690]
And I used to be one of the biggest...

[02:00:05.690 --> 02:00:06.210]
Yeah, that was the thing.

[02:00:06.370 --> 02:00:07.170]
I don't understand it.

[02:00:07.230 --> 02:00:08.450]
You used to really like baseball.

[02:00:08.450 --> 02:00:10.070]
I used to love baseball.

[02:00:10.250 --> 02:00:10.650]
I was obsessed.

[02:00:10.810 --> 02:00:12.130]
I used to go to London and begin to play.

[02:00:12.130 --> 02:00:12.530]
What's the point?

[02:00:12.770 --> 02:00:13.330]
That's the point.

[02:00:13.490 --> 02:00:14.170]
Yeah, what happened?

[02:00:14.810 --> 02:00:16.250]
It just got to be boring with me.

[02:00:16.370 --> 02:00:16.570]
I don't know.

[02:00:16.810 --> 02:00:20.610]
All the stupid money for all these marginal players who stink the joint out.

[02:00:20.930 --> 02:00:21.770]
And it's just...

[02:00:21.770 --> 02:00:22.490]
And watered down.

[02:00:22.830 --> 02:00:23.390]
All these...

[02:00:23.390 --> 02:00:25.270]
That's the whole thing with all professional sports.

[02:00:25.470 --> 02:00:26.650]
Too much watering down, man.

[02:00:27.450 --> 02:00:31.410]
It's like if you have a fine wine and you like to take a bunch of water and you run it under the tap

[02:00:31.410 --> 02:00:33.410]
and fill up half the bottle with water.

[02:00:34.030 --> 02:00:34.870]
Watered down, man.

[02:00:36.430 --> 02:00:38.550]
Watered down, kind of like the QAM format.

[02:00:38.790 --> 02:00:39.430]
Watered down.

[02:00:40.270 --> 02:00:40.730]
Anyway.

[02:00:41.830 --> 02:00:46.170]
Hoping the muscle flared into a preeminent rule and picking next year's Democratic and Republican presidential candidates.

[02:00:46.630 --> 02:00:49.470]
The state has voted the state to leap-prod almost all the other states.

[02:00:49.930 --> 02:00:50.430]
Leap-prod.

[02:00:50.590 --> 02:00:51.430]
Jump right over.

[02:00:51.750 --> 02:00:55.830]
And set a January 29th primary with the option to go even earlier.

[02:00:56.350 --> 02:00:57.630]
Let's have the primary next week.

[02:00:58.430 --> 02:01:01.770]
The change championed by House Speaker Marco Rubio, Republican WestMine,

[02:01:01.770 --> 02:01:06.830]
and approved 115 to 1, is part of a national rush by states, coveting the cloud of Iowa,

[02:01:07.230 --> 02:01:09.790]
or as Janet would said, Iowa and New Hampshire.

[02:01:10.490 --> 02:01:12.950]
Those states have enormous sway in choosing presidential candidates,

[02:01:13.230 --> 02:01:16.230]
even though they're small as some say, unrepresentable relations people and politics,

[02:01:16.650 --> 02:01:18.230]
they propose almost still pass the state Senate.

[02:01:19.390 --> 02:01:22.730]
Florida is obviously going to be the big and Shalada baby on the 29th

[02:01:22.730 --> 02:01:28.170]
and they'll immediately become very, very important said Nicole Ray, the a science professor at FIU.

[02:01:29.010 --> 02:01:33.030]
Florida's bid for increased influence is being tempered by the other vote-rich giants, California, New York, and Texas.

[02:01:33.690 --> 02:01:36.950]
California's already moved its primary to February 5th, others expected to do the same.

[02:01:37.890 --> 02:01:41.750]
It's been more than three decades since Florida mattered much when it comes to picking presidential candidates,

[02:01:42.050 --> 02:01:43.730]
but they're moving on up, baby, to the east side.

[02:01:43.810 --> 02:01:44.710]
We could play a little bit of that.

[02:01:45.890 --> 02:01:46.770]
Nothing I want to buy.

[02:01:46.870 --> 02:01:47.530]
I do like that show.

[02:01:49.110 --> 02:01:50.870]
It's not long enough for you to take us to the ball.

[02:01:55.050 --> 02:01:55.950]
You're going to say it right now.

[02:01:56.030 --> 02:01:59.910]
Anybody who doesn't like the Jefferson's, who doesn't like that show is un-American and a communist,

[02:02:00.130 --> 02:02:01.850]
and ought to be in prison immediately if not sooner.

[02:02:02.010 --> 02:02:02.270]
Don't you think?

[02:02:03.370 --> 02:02:03.670]
Yes.

[02:02:04.890 --> 02:02:06.730]
You don't sound too enthusiastic about it.

[02:02:07.070 --> 02:02:09.250]
Now what's to the Miami Vice, or I know exactly what it is.

[02:02:10.010 --> 02:02:11.030]
Oh yeah, there it is.

[02:02:11.370 --> 02:02:12.930]
It's down on the phone. It's empty. It's down.

[02:02:15.030 --> 02:02:15.870]
Come on Stan.

[02:02:16.230 --> 02:02:17.670]
Now you didn't watch Miami Vice, did you?

[02:02:17.990 --> 02:02:18.230]
No.

[02:02:19.090 --> 02:02:19.810]
I didn't.

[02:02:20.390 --> 02:02:21.430]
I love my life.

[02:02:21.650 --> 02:02:22.970]
You're one short thing for me.

[02:02:23.290 --> 02:02:24.130]
What's that, Stan?

[02:02:24.210 --> 02:02:27.430]
Just a freeze major in Miami Vice, you're under arrest.

[02:02:27.750 --> 02:02:29.450]
Absolutely. I'm not going to do that.

[02:02:29.730 --> 02:02:30.030]
Oh you.

[02:02:30.570 --> 02:02:31.110]
Oh fine.

[02:02:31.630 --> 02:02:32.170]
I know, Stan.

[02:02:32.530 --> 02:02:33.010]
You won't get.

[02:02:33.390 --> 02:02:33.550]
Yes.

[02:02:33.850 --> 02:02:35.110]
Don Johnson, you're going to get a haircut.

[02:02:35.350 --> 02:02:35.630]
Thank you.

[02:02:35.730 --> 02:02:35.910]
There.

[02:02:36.210 --> 02:02:36.650]
Thank you.

[02:02:37.170 --> 02:02:37.610]
Hello.

[02:02:38.050 --> 02:02:38.590]
Yeah, Stan.

[02:02:39.390 --> 02:02:39.770]
Hello.

[02:02:40.610 --> 02:02:41.490]
Only if.

[02:02:42.570 --> 02:02:43.010]
Hello.

[02:02:43.410 --> 02:02:43.770]
Okay.

[02:02:44.390 --> 02:02:45.010]
Pardon me?

[02:02:45.650 --> 02:02:46.230]
I was done.

[02:02:46.710 --> 02:02:47.210]
Oh, I was done.

[02:02:47.430 --> 02:02:47.990]
You noticed that?

[02:02:47.990 --> 02:02:48.490]
Yeah.

[02:02:48.810 --> 02:02:49.630]
I saw Stan.

[02:02:49.850 --> 02:02:50.310]
Did you notice?

[02:02:50.430 --> 02:02:51.530]
It was either Don Johnson or A.

[02:02:51.630 --> 02:02:52.170]
Like him.

[02:02:52.230 --> 02:02:52.230]

[02:02:52.230 --> 02:02:52.230]

[02:02:52.290 --> 02:02:52.530]
I did.

[02:02:53.950 --> 02:02:55.430]
He is not like Howard Johnson.

[02:02:55.990 --> 02:02:56.310]
Absolutely.

[02:02:57.110 --> 02:02:58.610]
And I couldn't have known that he was a man student.

[02:02:58.950 --> 02:02:59.730]
Just like Don Johnson.

[02:03:00.570 --> 02:03:01.350]
What do you think, sir?

[02:03:02.150 --> 02:03:02.950]
I'm kind of the kind of guy.

[02:03:03.050 --> 02:03:03.610]
He'll even get a haircut.

[02:03:03.970 --> 02:03:04.210]
Thank you.

[02:03:04.510 --> 02:03:05.510]
What an imagination man.

[02:03:05.590 --> 02:03:06.170]
That's the image.

[02:03:06.510 --> 02:03:08.370]
See, I told you this wouldn't take us all the way to the end.

[02:03:08.410 --> 02:03:08.930]
But you know what, Will?

[02:03:09.470 --> 02:03:09.890]
What's that?

[02:03:10.110 --> 02:03:10.610]
Crime chance.

[02:03:11.530 --> 02:03:13.050]
Oh, I should have played that, but no.

[02:03:13.350 --> 02:03:13.870]
It's too late now.

[02:03:15.030 --> 02:03:16.750]
I'm not going to chop that baby off in the middle.

[02:03:16.750 --> 02:03:17.350]
Are you crazy?

[02:03:18.410 --> 02:03:20.570]
I think I started this a few seconds too soon.

[02:03:21.450 --> 02:03:22.510]
That was a great idea.

[02:03:22.650 --> 02:03:24.950]
Why didn't you tell me that like four minutes ago?

[02:03:25.070 --> 02:03:25.410]
God.

[02:03:28.470 --> 02:03:30.050]
Well, thanks for enjoying our company.

[02:03:30.230 --> 02:03:32.130]
There's so much, uh, what have you named us?

[02:03:32.770 --> 02:03:33.590]
All right, Bob.

[02:03:33.970 --> 02:03:34.770]
Next to you.

[02:03:34.870 --> 02:03:35.430]
I know it's been a while.

[02:03:35.690 --> 02:03:38.510]
Look, Josh was in here with us today and we loved every second of a man.

[02:03:38.790 --> 02:03:39.110]
It's like that.

[02:03:39.930 --> 02:03:41.270]
It skipped out on a meeting.

[02:03:42.150 --> 02:03:43.970]
And I think George and the Austin can get him out.

[02:03:44.030 --> 02:03:45.190]
He's probably planning on right now.

[02:03:46.250 --> 02:03:47.310]
Harlem's baseball, baby.

[02:03:47.650 --> 02:03:48.390]
Run for the hills.

[02:03:48.550 --> 02:03:48.890]
It's coming.
