[00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:08.440]
It can happen at any moment, at any time, right in the middle of making love.

[00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:09.240]
Oh!

[00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:10.220]
Ja!

[00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:12.540]
Ja!

[00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.640]
Ja!

[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.840]
Ja!

[00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:16.520]
Jerry!

[00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.140]
My name is Larry!

[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.040]
Oh, sorry!

[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:22.660]
Oh, Larry!

[00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:23.920]
Larry!

[00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.560]
Oh, my sexual stutter end!

[00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:28.380]
Larry!

[00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:29.980]
If you suffer from hunger, you'll suffer from hunger!

[00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:29.980]

[00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:29.980]

[00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:29.980]

[00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:29.980]

[00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:29.980]

[00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:29.980]

[00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:29.980]

[00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:31.300]
Homosexual stuttering!

[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.540]
Oh, yeah!

[00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.860]
Call 100!

[00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:37.860]

[00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:38.000]
Call today!

[00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:39.460]
That's 100!

[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.200]
Oh, yeah!

[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:43.320]
That's 100!

[00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:43.320]

[00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:43.320]

[00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:43.320]

[00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:43.880]
That's the name was Larry!

[00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.080]
It's 10-1 at 5-60 WK.

[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.120]
What am I laughing about?

[00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:47.900]
Well, I'll tell you.

[00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:52.280]
But it might as well have a smile on your post and look the Joey's ASB or umbrella.

[00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:53.560]
There's nothing we used to say.

[00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:54.220]
It's not like that.

[00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:55.860]
Yeah, some crap like that.

[00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.080]
So anyway, yesterday I did not go.

[00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.460]
You'll be pleased to know the bastard Robbins for ice cream.

[00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.760]
Now, first of all, I've been talked out of it by people who care enough to send their very best.

[00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:04.360]
That's number one.

[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.280]
Number two, even if I wanted to go, I never had the opportunity.

[00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.400]
So I don't want to take too much credit for it.

[00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.380]
But, and the reason I had no opportunity is because it was not even, oh, I don't know, a minute passed to a clock.

[00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.340]
I was shutting stuff off and here and you're ready to pick up my blank, my poison berry.

[00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.160]
And I'm on the way out of this room and all of a sudden, in my hand, that things start...

[00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:24.740]
Like that, you know?

[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.340]
Like that.

[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.420]
And there's a phone call I've answered.

[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.200]
It's jolly fat ass joebell.

[00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.200]
Where's it fat ass jolly joebell?

[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.120]
Who starts out right off the bad practice, maybe.

[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.200]
He didn't waste any time.

[00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.320]
To tell me that there's a Bokobryan bit that we can't play.

[00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:47.140]
Now, keep in mind that the Bokobryan bits are previewed by our program director, Josh aka Clarence Dero.

[00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.960]
And he approves or disapproves, as the case may be.

[00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.340]
He approves to this one, we've been playing it and everybody loves it, which is probably why we can't play it anymore.

[00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.220]
It's too good and it's too popular and the audience likes it too much.

[00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.160]
So, not only can't we play the fart sounds, we can't play the bit about the fart sounds, no more fart sounds.

[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.400]
Which I guess I can give.

[00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.420]
I mean, I can't play it, but I can give you like a little refresher course or what a...

[00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:09.580]
Shrek.

[00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:10.900]
Ain't no fart sound.

[00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.140]
Anymore, that, no, any more of that either.

[00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.400]
So, those people on the audience who think that I'm just making enough when I tell you that, oh, we can't do this, we can't say that.

[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.620]
And then we... this is just another step in the progression or the regression of QAM.

[00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.700]
And of course, the excuse being here is that I guess Joyce has been out of shape.

[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:29.780]
Oh, poor Joyce.

[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:31.040]
Bokobryan.

[00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.880]
They did not say that I can't call her a bitch or anything else that I want to.

[00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.900]
So, I will continue doing that.

[00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.720]
But I guess she was a p-oat about it and too bad.

[00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:39.960]
We don't really give a crap, okay?

[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.540]
And number two, the aim is things.

[00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:44.200]
Not going to be seen.

[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.380]
First, it was the Janet Jackson nipple thing that was the excuse for everything else.

[00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.640]
Oh, yeah, we got the FCC's crackin' down.

[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.460]
Well, the FCC is not crackin' down.

[00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:57.760]
I'm ripping Joyce or on fart sounds or any of these things which have nothing to do with the latest act of psychosis by beastly broad chasing.

[00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.500]
I mean, these people are...

[00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.080]
B do do do do do.

[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.620]
Their broadcast is like I'm an open-heart surgeon, okay?

[00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.400]
I got an operation in Performer 1030.

[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:05.040]
I'll see you, Joyce.

[00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.460]
All right, I'm getting my scalpel sharpened up right now.

[00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.740]
But it's very sad.

[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:18.420]
And my first reaction was, you know, I wasted a half an hour on the phone with this guy because he hasn't got a clue.

[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.180]
He hasn't got a clue.

[00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.260]
And the conversation with him always ends, well, I don't know what to tell you, Neil.

[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:32.360]
And no matter what you say, whether it's pleasant or unpleasant, and usually it's unpleasant, no matter what you say, it always ends with that same, I don't know what to tell you, Neil.

[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:33.320]
And that's that.

[00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.840]
And I said, well, who the hell does know what to tell me?

[00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.140]
I was pretty esteemed.

[00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:38.000]
I was a little p-oat.

[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.920]
I was highly p-oat.

[00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:46.340]
And then come to find out that clearance told you about this before the show yesterday, but what time was this?

[00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.200]
Oh, it's like three minutes till.

[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.000]
Three minutes before we came on a year?

[00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:51.240]
Yeah, so I'm going to say that.

[00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.120]
Whatever it is that you need to say to him, yeah, it's not me.

[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.320]
You know, it's hard sounds, any moe, I mean, any moe.

[00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:58.240]
You can't play that.

[00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.220]
So I guess I didn't find out about it.

[00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.300]
And of course, luckily I was able to play it those last five times.

[00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.280]
I didn't know what the end result was going to be either if they were going to just band it completely, make us change it, whatever.

[00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:06.760]

[00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.420]
Yeah, I guess.

[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:14.100]
I mean, I'm sure that if that yeast infected a hole, if that's the line that's got everybody all whipped up into a frenzy.

[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.140]
And of course, like I said, excuse now, like Janet Jackson was before everything else.

[00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:19.860]
Now it's I'm getting canned.

[00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.300]
Of course, I'm just didn't get canned for any FCC violation.

[00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.100]
I'm just got canned because CBS came into the pressure.

[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.480]
Right.

[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.120]
Well, I don't think that there's any pressure group outside, picketing out inside the building right now.

[00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.680]
Pressure going to be half of that nasty bitch of joys.

[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.120]
I could be wrong about that.

[00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:40.300]
Maybe she's got a whole bunch of flunky lawyers out there, picketing with signs of the crime and peeing on the right.

[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.400]
I have a feeling not, you know.

[00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:43.540]
Yeah, I have a feeling not.

[00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:48.120]
So anyway, my first reaction was to become very, very highly agitated and angry.

[00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.520]
And so I called up Norma Kent, which is usually an exercise in futility.

[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.040]
And I was screaming.

[00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.480]
I mean, you've heard me scream and shriek in the past, but I don't think quite like this.

[00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.140]
I was a wild man.

[00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:00.200]
Not Donald Wild.

[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:02.160]
Okay.

[00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.440]
Screaming and shrieking, carrying on and bitching and molting.

[00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:11.660]
And so he evidently put in a call to Jolly Jo, and the two of them confedulated around six, which I didn't even know about that.

[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.840]
Because nobody bothered to call me back and tell me about it.

[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.320]
Because Norma's too busy chasing boyfriends or whatever he's doing.

[00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:21.000]
But anyway, I don't know later on in the evening I sat here and I was thinking about it.

[00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.580]
And I thought to myself, self-screw them.

[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:24.820]
You know, they're hopeless.

[00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:29.280]
If we get a one share, although George isn't too happy about it because he needs that bonus money.

[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.920]
Bad from the ratings that we almost always get.

[00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:33.040]
Almost.

[00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:34.940]
We didn't get any last time.

[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.400]
I know.

[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:36.940]
I know.

[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.700]
But other than that, I think we've always gotten a little something, something.

[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:41.500]
So it was always something you could count on.

[00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:41.960]
Right.

[00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:42.560]
That's correct.

[00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:43.420]
That is correct.

[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.080]
But not no more.

[00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:45.280]
No.

[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.660]
Now that they've taken this thing and driven it down to the depths.

[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.320]
And of course, eight million excuses.

[00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:52.440]
Well, we don't have our license yet.

[00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:53.400]
And not a meat but a boot.

[00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:54.000]
But it won't pop.

[00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:54.540]
But your fault.

[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:55.920]
Yeah, it's not nothing I did.

[00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:58.960]
I didn't put for all on the internet and put stern on here, which everybody needs.

[00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:02.160]
I said that that was going to last a very short time and be a disaster.

[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.400]
And they keep shooting themselves on the feet and then they want to make everybody else suffer for it.

[00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:07.560]
That's what they've basically done.

[00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:14.080]
And since this guy has come in this goofball, I mean, he's just, he's incredible to me.

[00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:15.140]
Jolly Joe.

[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:16.320]
He's just, just incredible.

[00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.940]
Like I said, you could have a conversation for six hours.

[00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.200]
And at the end of the conversation, he would say, well, I don't know what to tell you.

[00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:27.820]
And that would be it.

[00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:34.020]
And you'd ask yourself the musical question, why did I just wait six hours of my life talking to this knucklehead?

[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:35.220]
You know, why did I do that?

[00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:42.920]
No one had brought up the thing about poor Boca Brian chicken neck, not being able to get paid for his services for the last three months.

[00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:44.540]
Oh, I didn't know anything about that.

[00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:48.900]
And I was screaming and yelling at him about the beesleaves being a totally unreputable company.

[00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.700]
And they don't pay people on time and they don't pay their bills.

[00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:53.440]
No, I don't think you're right about that.

[00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.520]
Yeah, well, whatever you say. You know, you're a face man.

[00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:57.320]
You're a corporate face man, Joe.

[00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:01.000]
I used to think like with good intentions. I called him Jolly.

[00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:04.320]
He's not Jolly. He's depressing as what he is.

[00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:11.720]
So anyway, last night, like I said, I find it, I shook myself out of that anger and I called up Norma Kent.

[00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:13.960]
I said, you know what? Screw it. Screw it.

[00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:17.280]
If they want me to play, we can go do the music thing.

[00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:18.800]
Now the Ricky Shaw's off here.

[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.500]
My good buddy. He doesn't play music.

[00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:24.540]
We can play Hungarian mizurkas, Chinese melodies.

[00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:30.220]
It makes no difference to me because obviously they don't care if they get a one share or a 20 share.

[00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:32.280]
It doesn't make any difference of ratings and success.

[00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:32.860]
I don't know.

[00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:34.740]
They don't care about ratings.

[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:36.740]
No, because it's got nothing to do with ball games.

[00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:38.100]
And ball games don't get any ratings.

[00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:40.760]
And the Marlins are good. That's a lame duck.

[00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:42.300]
Anyway, we know it's the last season for them.

[00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:45.700]
We know the Panthers ain't coming back because that was like a disaster.

[00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:52.880]
I mean, you know, putting a hockey game's on in the market where there's like five real fans who even understand a difference between a puck and a frozen bagel.

[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:53.980]
I mean, what are we talking about?

[00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:57.840]
And so that's where we are.

[00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:00.720]
And I'm sure there are people in the audience think, oh, he's got to be making this up.

[00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:03.180]
I mean, well, what was the big deal with that, but it was funny.

[00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:07.440]
That was the big deal. And of course, everybody wanted to hear it over and over and over again.

[00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:10.240]
So luckily, nobody bothered telling me yesterday.

[00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.140]
So I went ahead and played it 800 times.

[00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:17.560]
Thank goodness for that, including right at the end of the show.

[00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:18.180]
Is that ironic?

[00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:18.460]
Sure.

[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:21.460]
The last bit we played right at the end of the show.

[00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:25.480]
But these people, like I said, they're not competing.

[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:26.660]
Right.

[00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:26.740]

[00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:29.100]
They're doing is destroying whatever good they're holding only.

[00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:30.580]
They're destroying it.

[00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:32.220]
They're rolling over like a dog lays in it.

[00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:32.860]
And I apologize.

[00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:33.840]
Because you know what a dog like.

[00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:35.980]
I apologize to all the dogs in the world.

[00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:38.680]
Okay, compared to them to the beesleaves because that's an insult to the dogs.

[00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:42.220]
Rolling over, putting their paws up in the ear, like, oh, we surrender.

[00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:46.260]
They're waving the white flag out the window is what they're doing.

[00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:47.260]
Flag a surrender.

[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:51.040]
And I said, well, what is it you would like me to do?

[00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:54.700]
He said, well, you know, they'd like you to get a seven share without saying anything controversial.

[00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:56.480]
How do you like that?

[00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:56.860]
Yeah.

[00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:57.700]
Of course.

[00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:02.680]
They would be like saying they would like you to do a spectacular show without making any sounds with your mouth.

[00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:05.220]
I mean, it's right along the same kind of concept.

[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:08.000]
And I said, I don't think there's anybody who can do that.

[00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:08.400]
Joe.

[00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:13.340]
Whoa, whoa, you got to do the best you can.

[00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:14.660]
And that's what I've been doing every day.

[00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:15.620]
Do the best I can.

[00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:18.900]
And so today we're going to take a plethora of calls.

[00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:19.280]
Okay.

[00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:22.560]
And we're going to be screening recalls for the first time in I don't know how many years.

[00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:25.060]
And maybe you know something maybe that'll work.

[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:27.360]
Maybe that'll be the solution to the problem.

[00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:29.720]
And maybe not.

[00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:30.220]
We'll see.

[00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:33.940]
But I'm certainly more than willing to be of anything to try to try to celebrate some kind.

[00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:37.020]
And I don't want to go out like some kind of a fool in the last 18 months.

[00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:38.360]
You know what?

[00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:41.460]
Like Howard Beale said, I've invested 80s in years in this.

[00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:47.120]
And in this case, 9 and a half years on this radio station, I don't want to go out to like some kind of a schlepper.

[00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:47.540]
You know?

[00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:50.840]
Like some kind of a circus clown.

[00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:59.280]
Well guess what, baby.

[00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:00.700]
Send in the clowns.

[00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:01.880]
I'm sending you a paint kit.

[00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:02.800]
Really?

[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:03.260]
Yeah.

[00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:04.900]
How about one big pants, Adams?

[00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:05.700]
The rest rubber nose.

[00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:06.660]
Oh yeah, you know what?

[00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:07.740]
The biggest red rubber ball on my body.

[00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:09.420]
The biggest rubber nose I can find.

[00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:10.200]
The one where it knows.

[00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:11.920]
Or red rubber.

[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:12.860]
Well I can't say that.

[00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:14.000]
It goes after the rubber.

[00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:14.760]
I can't say that.

[00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:16.300]
Is this Judy Collins?

[00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:17.060]
You know it.

[00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:17.640]
Oh.

[00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:19.780]
Send in the clowns.

[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.700]
George hates Judy, but no I don't.

[00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:23.840]
I'll tell you more.

[00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:25.280]
What a Judy Collins.

[00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:26.320]
I never said anything about it.

[00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:26.780]
I have no idea.

[00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:31.760]
I hate somebody who's like some folks saying, or I can't think of which one of these.

[00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:35.780]
You could play this all day.

[00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:36.240]
Wouldn't be good.

[00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:37.000]
And then who wouldn't be kind?

[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:37.260]
Why not?

[00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:37.660]
Safe?

[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:38.620]
I don't know.

[00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:40.240]
I don't know anymore.

[00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:41.680]
See if it's parents improved.

[00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:42.900]
No, I can't kill that.

[00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:45.900]
Although that doesn't really prove anything anymore because you've proved that big too.

[00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:48.800]
And then, oh gee, corporate doesn't want you to play that any more.

[00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:49.720]
Any more.

[00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:52.540]
Here's the clown.

[00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:53.640]
Yeah, that's appropriate.

[00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:54.200]
Here we go.

[00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:56.240]
Lots of here's lots of clowns.

[00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:57.100]
The QIM folks.

[00:10:57.540 --> 00:10:57.900]
Smoking.

[00:10:58.340 --> 00:10:59.240]
He's smoking it.

[00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:00.420]
I can't think of it.

[00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:03.800]
A lot of people in this fight, that corporate can smoke and smoke.

[00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:06.720]
But they're like that boy.

[00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:07.620]
You talk about kneeling.

[00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:08.620]
I kneeled at it.

[00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:10.200]
Even Jesus never got kneeled like that.

[00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:10.840]
That was beautiful.

[00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:11.900]
There's one more for you.

[00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:15.160]
Everly brothers.

[00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:16.000]
Can he's clown?

[00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:16.500]
Very good.

[00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:18.300]
Man is a freaking genius.

[00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:20.120]
Don't want your love.

[00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:22.020]
I don't like that.

[00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:23.620]
I have the song of the 100 years.

[00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:24.660]
I talk that baby brother.

[00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:27.340]
I love the Everly brothers man done and filled back in the day.

[00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:28.020]
They're old and ugly.

[00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:29.020]
I'm sure about that.

[00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:29.560]

[00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:30.720]
That could be the new format.

[00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:31.620]
I'll talk about them someday.

[00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:33.160]
That's a good idea.

[00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:33.860]
I could talk up.

[00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:39.200]
And then every time I miss a talk up for a step on somebody, you get shot in the ledger.

[00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:39.800]
Something like that.

[00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:41.060]
They'd be glad to do that.

[00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:42.420]
Well, hook up some electrodes.

[00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:46.040]
And of course, how about those tapes?

[00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:47.080]
Yeah.

[00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:51.440]
I didn't even remember to get in that with them because I was so agitated about this other stuff.

[00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:52.920]
And of course, what would he say anyway?

[00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:55.000]
But I mean, but I mean, but I mean, because he's the expert.

[00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:56.420]
He knows his craft man.

[00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:00.940]
Believe me, in fact, I think what it comes to Joe Bell and the Beasley's, they have one thing in common.

[00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:02.020]
Is their middle name.

[00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:03.240]
I could be wrong about that.

[00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:05.440]
But I just have an inkling.

[00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:07.600]
Have an inkling and ready to do the inkling.

[00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:07.900]

[00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:08.400]
Is that what you call it?

[00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:10.220]
And I tend to have 13 at 560 WQM.

[00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:13.460]
That's the latest and not the greatest, as the beat goes on here at QM.

[00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:16.860]
Can we finally, you know, I'd like to be consistent on this station.

[00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:19.240]
We got that point at 11 o'clock at night.

[00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:21.100]
Maybe we can do it at a point something all day long.

[00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:22.720]
All every number will start with a...

[00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:23.120]
Oh!

[00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:25.560]
Everyone can get a lot of beat.

[00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:27.220]
All right!

[00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:29.760]
The erudgers are sports-hole radio.

[00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:32.720]
We had to come around here, but they'd blast off already.

[00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:36.400]
Ho ho ho!

[00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:37.080]
Who is that?

[00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:40.420]
The level of the memory.

[00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:41.320]
Oh!

[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:43.800]
But I did not order for the level.

[00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:45.700]
Did you order these?

[00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:48.260]
Wooo!

[00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:48.520]
Wooo!

[00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:53.220]
I'd like to...

[00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:55.160]
We had to make a loop out of that sounder that...

[00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:56.360]
Whatever she's doing.

[00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:59.620]
And just played that for four hours, because all the probably joy should be offended.

[00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:00.920]
A lot of times she's easily offended.

[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:03.280]
You notice we had a car around Holder on line two.

[00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:05.440]
Actually, there were three, but they all dropped it.

[00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:06.120]
I would break, yeah.

[00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:08.600]
There were three on hold, and they all dumped after everything.

[00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:09.740]
And from point of view, I think of the living.

[00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:13.340]
So, so far, that experiment doesn't seem to be working magnificently well.

[00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:16.240]
You'd think with that announcement that I made that revelation at the beginning of the show

[00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:19.100]
that people would be like doing cartwheels over the phone right now,

[00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:25.200]
and wanting this thing to carry on about the beesleaves and about the destruction of a once entertaining show and station

[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:26.700]
and all of these...

[00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:27.200]
All of the things.

[00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:28.000]
But they don't.

[00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:33.400]
56670560, we'd like to at least get one call on today that we put on hold now.

[00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:36.720]
And Palm 560 and they Verizon singular wireless lines.

[00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:39.300]
Kind of like shoots...

[00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:41.220]
See, and of course, I'm creature of ham, but that I am.

[00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:44.660]
I see a couple ringing in it, and I want to like reach over it, but I'm not going to do that.

[00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:45.940]
Don't let me do it by the way.

[00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:47.720]
Just like the ice cream yesterday.

[00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:49.680]
Here's our first collar on hold, line 6.

[00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:49.960]
Hello.

[00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:56.860]
All right, working good so far.

[00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:57.180]
Excellent.

[00:13:57.680 --> 00:13:58.580]
Good thing, can you?

[00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:03.180]
56670560, Palm 560, and they've Verizon singular wireless line.

[00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:04.500]
Let's see if we can get like one real one.

[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:08.540]
And then I'll just go back to what I was doing before that has not taken any of the calls.

[00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:11.120]
So, he doesn't understand.

[00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:12.320]
There are no callers anymore.

[00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:14.660]
And part of the reason being that there are no listeners anymore either.

[00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:16.180]
But that's what they're doing to this place.

[00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:18.760]
And it's going to be everybody else's fault.

[00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:19.440]
It's Hank's fault.

[00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:20.460]
It's the mad dog's fault.

[00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:22.220]
It's certainly George's fault.

[00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:24.600]
Oh, definitely white fault too, because I'm a...

[00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:24.920]
Oh, yeah.

[00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:26.060]
QAM, hello.

[00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:27.300]
Andy, how's it going?

[00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:28.100]
Okay, sir.

[00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:32.540]
Andy, I don't know if you saw senior tonight, but tonight on the BioWdrF channel,

[00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:38.100]
they're going to have this guy who kind of got old on the machines, the slot machines.

[00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:39.500]
Yeah.

[00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:45.260]
And he did something to the computer and he made up killing up with just a big look at it, see what he...

[00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:46.880]
What time is this going to be?

[00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:49.960]
Tuesday, I mean tonight at 10 o'clock on the BioWdrF channel.

[00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.480]
I'll... I'll... I'll... P.V.R., thanks a lot, family.

[00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:53.180]
You got it, buddy.

[00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:54.600]
Alright, see, there's a real call.

[00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:55.940]
Let's see how good that's working.

[00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:57.100]
I think Joe ought to do a show.

[00:14:57.220 --> 00:14:58.080]
I think we ought to put him on.

[00:14:58.120 --> 00:14:59.280]
Instead of those stupid ass tapes.

[00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:00.060]
Great idea.

[00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:01.140]
QAM, hello.

[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:02.640]
Yeah, I knew.

[00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:03.480]
Yes.

[00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:05.820]
I think it's wrong that they took your phone off.

[00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:06.500]
That's too good.

[00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:07.900]
So, it never takes your phone off the air.

[00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:08.620]
Oh, it's too good.

[00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:09.200]
It's too good.

[00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:09.820]
It's too good, my friend.

[00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:12.640]
I hope you guys are having a wonderful time together, right?

[00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:13.040]
That was.

[00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:14.180]
I'll bring your friend.

[00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:14.640]
That's too good.

[00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:17.440]
That's him.

[00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:19.040]
WQA and hello.

[00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:20.220]
Hello.

[00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:20.360]
And you?

[00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:21.060]
Yes.

[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:22.020]
Oh, hi.

[00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:24.400]
You know, you're taking a right attitude.

[00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:27.660]
Just go with the flow because it's happening in government.

[00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:29.720]
It's happening in companies everywhere.

[00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:31.940]
It's just politically correct agenda.

[00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:35.680]
And you're right, because it was bothering me for the longest time.

[00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:36.540]
And you know what?

[00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:38.200]
You can't fight it.

[00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:39.080]
You just really can't.

[00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:40.980]
No, I'm just going to keep doing what I said I was going to do.

[00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:42.380]
And it's taking the money twice a month.

[00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:46.140]
And if they get no number, don't blame me for it.

[00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:48.460]
I mean, you know, we're trying to our best here, but they don't want your best.

[00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:52.420]
Do you want whatever watered down crap they think constitutes a radio show?

[00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:53.580]
Believe me, they don't know crap.

[00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:59.520]
And I really think, I mean, I could be wrong, but I know that these leads own more than just this station.

[00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:01.540]
I mean, I know it's all sports to them.

[00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:06.820]
But I mean, are they trying to lose money so they could take something off at the end of the year for taxes?

[00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:08.880]
I mean, because I can't understand this.

[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:11.920]
I don't understand why they would go with the flow.

[00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:12.720]
Just calm down.

[00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:14.560]
Take a couple of experts and you'll be okay.

[00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:16.020]
Okay, well you take care now.

[00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:16.440]
Thank you.

[00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:17.700]
Thank you.

[00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:18.680]
Wait a little exercise.

[00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:20.820]
I'm trying to tell you, stay calm for Christ's sake.

[00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:22.980]
Stay calm like me and don't get all worked up.

[00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:23.960]
Christ.

[00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:26.120]
WDQYM, hello.

[00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:27.440]
Hey, Neil.

[00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:28.220]
Yes sir.

[00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:28.260]

[00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:30.000]
Who?

[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.120]
Glenn 61.

[00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:32.980]
You know something?

[00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:36.260]
You know, I deleted your ass off the MySpace.

[00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:38.500]
And you don't want you on the phone either.

[00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:41.000]
We don't want you on MySpace, in our face, you're sick.

[00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:41.780]
You're sick.

[00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:42.480]
Okay, you're sick.

[00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:44.380]
Take your gun, stick it in your account.

[00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:45.180]
Glory of Brains.

[00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:46.880]
Glenn 61, check it out.

[00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:52.780]
He sends me, after he put on the, after he deleted his own profile yesterday, or the day before I talked about it,

[00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:57.580]
he comes back on there last night and he's got this weird thing and he's got all these sex pictures.

[00:16:57.580 --> 00:17:02.040]
He's telling me all these different sites and I got news for Glenn when I need to see you naked.

[00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:05.220]
That's the day I needed to out borrow one of your guns and blow my brains out.

[00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:07.040]
Okay, and yours two at the same time.

[00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:10.320]
Stay the hell away.

[00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:11.980]
I don't know what's going on this week.

[00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:17.740]
We had Dave Friedman come back, ready, ask Dave Friedman with his sour attitude and now this guy.

[00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:19.340]
And then this morning also, what's his name?

[00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:23.680]
The Abullian guy, Jerry, the Abullian guy who also kissed goodbye quite a while ago.

[00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:25.120]
But they just can't stay away, you know.

[00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:26.500]
They cannot stay away.

[00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:27.500]
The word is obsessed.

[00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:28.940]
They're obsessed.

[00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:31.640]
Glenn 61, my ass.

[00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:33.240]
They, the hell away.

[00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:33.680]
How do you do that?

[00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:34.040]
Sick.

[00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:34.860]
Get some help.

[00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:36.700]
WQA and hello.

[00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:37.980]
Neo, what's up, my friend?

[00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:38.600]
Yes, sir.

[00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:43.340]
Neo, no, the thing with the, the virus channel is the guy that made counterfeit coins.

[00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:46.660]
Like the, uh, casino coins that you put in the slot machine?

[00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:48.600]
They, but they don't use those anymore.

[00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:48.900]
Right.

[00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:52.120]
He, he, he was the one that created perfect counterfeit of them.

[00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:54.620]
And also, Neo, take your own advice.

[00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:56.620]
Take the F and money.

[00:17:57.220 --> 00:17:57.220]

[00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:59.280]
Just take the F and money.

[00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:00.120]
Okay, stay calm.

[00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:01.900]
Are you getting the lecture size like that last guy?

[00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:02.460]
Stay calm.

[00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:03.500]
Just stay calm.

[00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:04.440]
Cool.

[00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:04.840]
Cool.

[00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:05.060]
Right.

[00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:05.860]
Right.

[00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:11.900]
Before we send you to the, to the Ricky Tiki school of calming down in yoga.

[00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:13.520]
Okay, see you.

[00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:14.940]
WQA and hello.

[00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:16.820]
Hey, what's up, I'm going to help.

[00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:17.420]
Yes, sir.

[00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:21.780]
No, I just wanted to give my take on the QA and situation.

[00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:22.360]
Go right ahead.

[00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:23.680]
Talk about this radio station.

[00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:25.240]
We'll give you three, four, five hours to do it.

[00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:25.720]
So go ahead.

[00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:27.240]
Rip them up major ass.

[00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:33.460]
Well, when, when, when you, you know, when we found out Moe had been whatever can they're

[00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:38.920]
you resigned or whatever, I knew it was going to be bad because as much as I hated Moe at

[00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:40.280]
time, you know, you had a show.

[00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:41.940]
I wouldn't mind listening to it.

[00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:44.060]
Yeah, that there must have been it when they let Moe go.

[00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:46.440]
That was the, that was the beginning of the end for QA, I mean.

[00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:48.180]
No, no, listen to me.

[00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:48.520]
I'm serious.

[00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:49.020]
I'm listening.

[00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:54.600]
I'm not going to wait because who in their right mind, okay, we give Kim both angles of

[00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:54.820]
show.

[00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:57.060]
Seriously, somebody who's deaf.

[00:18:57.760 --> 00:18:59.280]
I mean, my God.

[00:18:59.520 --> 00:18:59.800]
Yeah.

[00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:01.520]
What do you think of it as well?

[00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:02.380]
What's that?

[00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:05.960]
Well, because at least I will listen to you and Moe.

[00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:10.360]
Now I just listen to you and I'm gone because that dog, you know, he's all right, but you

[00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:15.360]
know, and then Harmpers, so it comes down to your show, which has been butchered and you

[00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:17.100]
can't even do the show you used to do.

[00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:18.340]
And I'm talking about that.

[00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:19.700]
Yeah, I close.

[00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:21.020]
It's pathetic.

[00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:22.020]
We can't say crap.

[00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:26.600]
I mean, if somebody would have told me 10 years ago that you couldn't play this and you

[00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:30.560]
couldn't play that and the convolices on can be placed, like, what the hell?

[00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:31.940]
Yeah, what the hell?

[00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:38.200]
I mean, I still listen and I'll listen to the end, but it's like, wow, remember the good old

[00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:38.380]
day.

[00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:41.340]
Yeah, at the end, this is the end.

[00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:43.640]
Okay, so how did Jim Morrison force?

[00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:44.420]
Thank you so much.

[00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:45.560]
So we're getting a lot of great calls.

[00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:46.620]
Now, Jono is his crap.

[00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:48.940]
His screen knows calls, baby.

[00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:52.460]
And of course, Chris being the fat ass that he is being just like all his predecessors,

[00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:53.980]
too, too lazy to screen to calls.

[00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:55.540]
That's where the blame goes.

[00:19:57.340 --> 00:19:57.680]
Right.

[00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:00.880]
His idea is, how do you like his stuff?

[00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:01.520]
He was a far-crisp.

[00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:02.840]
Oh, I love answering these phones.

[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.820]
Yeah, especially via nine calls from Ron already.

[00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:06.900]
Yeah, we did get on the ears.

[00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:07.920]
So that's the important thing.

[00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:09.300]
He's all here to come.

[00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:09.780]
Come to me and hello.

[00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:11.760]
Hello, how are you, sir?

[00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:12.360]
Okay, sir.

[00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:14.180]
I'm sitting very calm.

[00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:16.320]
I'm not going to get upset like your other callers.

[00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:16.580]
Good.

[00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:18.440]
Because I don't want you to get upset.

[00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:20.020]
I have things to say.

[00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:20.600]
I have something.

[00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:23.720]
I wanted to ask you a question and I had a statement.

[00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:26.760]
First, regarding QAM Bush League.

[00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:28.020]
That's it.

[00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:33.420]
The question I had for you was, the song that you used to play, I mean, I've been listening

[00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:34.380]
to you for years.

[00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:38.660]
I'm not going to say it because there was, it says the A word in there.

[00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:41.180]
Is that one out of the question then totally?

[00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:44.840]
Yeah, it's the one that was where you born.

[00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:47.900]
Yeah, when you're born in Aho, yeah, get out of here, man.

[00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:48.380]
You're perfect.

[00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:49.720]
Wow.

[00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:51.680]
In fact, what the hell?

[00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:52.920]
I haven't played that in so long.

[00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:53.840]
I'm not even sure.

[00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:55.680]
I know, well, there's that one with it.

[00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:56.800]
What is that called?

[00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:57.740]
Which one?

[00:20:58.400 --> 00:20:59.340]
Were you born?

[00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:01.600]
Oh, a 95.

[00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:02.700]
I got it.

[00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:03.180]
I got it.

[00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:03.180]

[00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:03.960]
I, 95.

[00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:05.280]
That's just the name of a highway.

[00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:06.240]
Can't be a thing wrong with that.

[00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:07.220]
Oh, yeah.

[00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:09.140]
If you drive on it.

[00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:09.660]
Bang.

[00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:12.780]
Let's play just a little tiny bit of all the stuff we can't play no more.

[00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:13.400]
You can be there.

[00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:13.860]
That's great.

[00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:15.160]
We'll be allowed.

[00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:16.640]
We need the entire week to do it.

[00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:19.860]
Even if we play 10 seconds of it, we can't play anymore.

[00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:21.580]
We'll be able to put five seconds of it.

[00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:21.720]
Yeah.

[00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:24.080]
We can't play that'll be the rest of my country for the next few months.

[00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:27.280]
Well, I was driving down 995 the other night.

[00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:27.620]
Yeah.

[00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:30.460]
Somebody nearly cut me right off the roof.

[00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:31.040]
I'll be nine.

[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:34.800]
I decided what we're going to do in a good, a good man.

[00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:37.420]
It's a road of song about him and Stan.

[00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:38.540]
I can't wait to hear it.

[00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:39.580]
It goes like this.

[00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:39.900]
Yeah.

[00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:42.900]
Where he bought it.

[00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:43.740]
Oh, man.

[00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:44.620]
Wow.

[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.100]
That's where we have to end that.

[00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:49.560]
Hey, half a word is better than none anyway.

[00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:50.940]
If you say so.

[00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:51.240]
Wow.

[00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:51.800]
What?

[00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:53.600]
Well, no, I would have liked to play the whole thing.

[00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:56.780]
But we certainly can't be playing that whole thing.

[00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:00.980]
Here's the poll rhymes with the poll from yesterday.

[00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:02.420]
237 votes.

[00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:05.480]
I'm going to have to slip all this stuff in there because I've got to take a million calls

[00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:08.240]
today and let them rip what's going on in this radio station.

[00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:09.920]
Which is unacceptable, but you know something.

[00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:12.640]
They're digging their own hole in the ground.

[00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:13.700]
They're creating their own funeral.

[00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:15.820]
And one day they'll pay the piper.

[00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:18.160]
They'll pee the, pee the peeper.

[00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:21.080]
How would you describe your sexual orientation on the scale from one to six?

[00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:23.620]
One completely straight, six completely gay.

[00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:25.860]
831 said one.

[00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:27.760]
67.1% totally straight.

[00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:29.780]
But 166 said two.

[00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:33.320]
Like once in a while, maybe they'll do a dilly dally or they just dilly.

[00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:34.640]
71 said six.

[00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:35.680]
That's completely gay.

[00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:38.080]
5.7% like this old queen yours truly.

[00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:43.260]
A 48 said three, which to me right in the middle is like by, at last time I checked.

[00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:46.180]
43 said I'm a Catholic priest or none which we don't believe anyway.

[00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:47.460]
21 said there were five.

[00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:49.020]
Mostly gay but not all the time.

[00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:50.560]
Most of the time but you know who knows.

[00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:52.240]
15, I'm asexual.

[00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:53.600]
Don't do it, A. Nothing.

[00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:55.240]
15, it varies by the day.

[00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:56.320]
11 said there were four.

[00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:59.420]
9 said I'm not really sure and 7 said it varies by the hour.

[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:00.420]
Just keep checking back.

[00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:02.100]
And what I just do there.

[00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:04.720]
O.C., I screwed myself all up with that damn I 95.

[00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:07.140]
The space and stands for nothing.

[00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:13.340]
President Bush and Queen Elizabeth looked like old friends today.

[00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:15.180]
They set a few islands together with the White House.

[00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:16.780]
And then his brief remarks.

[00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:20.980]
The president drew a roar from the crowd after putting his foot in his mouth.

[00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:22.920]
She is a fabulous fraud.

[00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:24.580]
I choose the moment.

[00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:25.640]
Take the star.

[00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:27.180]
A lot of present friendship.

[00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:33.460]
Neal Hall, Mrs. Bush, the hostess of this evening's White Thai dinner took the media on the tour of the state dining room.

[00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:38.860]
We're so happy tonight have the opportunity to entertain her majesty.

[00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:41.720]
She is a fabulous piece of ass.

[00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:47.160]
1033 ass is the word baby but don't say it because Joyce might get all that out of shape.

[00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:50.420]
Now you'll notice what's happening here and that is that these people don't hold on.

[00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:51.820]
Remember that one we used to do right?

[00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:56.300]
Of course we went screaming us for about what 100 years and we didn't have much to prove until we were like that.

[00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:57.900]
But I don't know what I'm doing.

[00:23:58.060 --> 00:23:59.040]
I don't know how to do a talk show.

[00:23:59.060 --> 00:23:59.760]
Maybe that's a problem.

[00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:01.240]
Maybe if they would have one of those seminars.

[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:02.020]
Right.

[00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:05.320]
Ding Dong School would be great.

[00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:07.720]
Ding Dong School, we could sit in the bullpen.

[00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:12.180]
They could do a little tap dance every morning before the show.

[00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:15.880]
They could send clearance in there to give us some pointers and tell us what to talk about.

[00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:17.840]
And have Emily sports oriented by the way.

[00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:19.380]
WQAM, hello.

[00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:22.760]
Hey, Ding Dong School, Miss Louise, I remember that.

[00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:27.260]
Glad you got the screen in calls again.

[00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:28.860]
It's going to keep idiots off the air.

[00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:30.140]
Not that I'm not one of them.

[00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:30.400]
Yeah.

[00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:30.880]
All right.

[00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:31.080]
Yeah.

[00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:33.460]
But I had one question for you.

[00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:35.520]
Francis Horwich, by the way, was Ding Dong School.

[00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:36.440]
Francis Horwich.

[00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:40.220]
And while Miss Louise was romper room, my mistake, my back.

[00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:40.400]
Yeah.

[00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:40.860]
Okay.

[00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:42.460]
Let me ask you a question.

[00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:46.240]
I mean, I know there's a lot to talk about with QAM but I want to talk about something off to the side if I could.

[00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:47.520]
To the side. Go ahead.

[00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:51.540]
Well, satellite would open an Anthony.

[00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:52.860]
Now, they're gone for a month.

[00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:54.120]
Now, I've never listened to their show.

[00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:55.340]
I really don't care about them.

[00:24:55.520 --> 00:25:02.240]
If they get suspended from satellite, which is supposed to be saying, do whatever you want, then what is there?

[00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:03.360]
There's no hope, man.

[00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:07.860]
Take your radio, take your car radio, and drop it in the bottom of the screen, baby.

[00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:08.600]
That's my suggestion.

[00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:09.900]
No, I love you.

[00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:11.880]
I listen to QAM more than anything.

[00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:14.960]
I'm fortunate that I'm kind of friends with Bo Campo.

[00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:18.040]
I'm sorry to see his statistics, his numbers are down a lot, that kind of stuff.

[00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:21.400]
But the management there, they put the gun to the station.

[00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:21.780]
They're selling those cells.

[00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:23.080]
This management's own fault there.

[00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:25.440]
It's as simple as that, putting hand in the morning was terrible.

[00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:26.180]
That's correct.

[00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:33.560]
You know, I mean, and Hank, Hank's, Hank, a manager doing, I think, a decent job, but they let the competition get back in the bargain.

[00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:35.660]
You guys did nothing to improve yourself.

[00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:39.300]
And you got, if you don't improve yourself, then you're falling behind.

[00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:40.160]
It's as simple as that.

[00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:40.900]
That is correct.

[00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:41.840]
I was gonna understand that.

[00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:43.600]
Okay, see you later, Lover.

[00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:44.500]
Okay, see you.

[00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:46.680]
And they're lost without a road map and a compass.

[00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:47.320]
That's the problem.

[00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:48.840]
They're lost in the middle of the Sahara Desert.

[00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:51.120]
They don't have a canteen with water.

[00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:52.520]
They don't have a compass, a road map.

[00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:53.860]
They don't have a search party.

[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.500]
You want to see if there's like a little tink of the water somewhere.

[00:25:56.940 --> 00:25:59.120]
And they would now have a tinkle if you put it in the right direction.

[00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:00.860]
Because Joyce wouldn't allow it.

[00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:02.600]
It would be pornographic to tinkle.

[00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:04.400]
Okay, let's take it well.

[00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:07.320]
See, I better get in the habit of taking these while we got them.

[00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:09.360]
Because they don't hang on.

[00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:09.700]
Right.

[00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:11.220]
Somebody QAM, hello.

[00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:13.040]
Hey, Neil, how you doing?

[00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:13.760]
Okay, sir.

[00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:15.840]
Yeah, are we talking about the same Joyce?

[00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:18.220]
Uh, there's over on the west coast.

[00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:19.660]
Are the Naples?

[00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:20.440]
Yes.

[00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:25.660]
Well, I was there a couple weeks past looking at picking out a plot from my mother.

[00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:27.640]
And I think this is the same Joyce.

[00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:29.940]
I ran into her in a country western bar.

[00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:31.520]
Okay, great.

[00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:35.460]
Okay, here's the poll we've written today so far.

[00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:38.560]
He ran into her in a country western bar.

[00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:39.100]
Not hard enough.

[00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:39.820]
Yeah.

[00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:42.060]
Two better wasn't with the Mac truck.

[00:26:42.980 --> 00:26:44.500]
813 votes on today's poll.

[00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:45.300]
We'll make 1,000.

[00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:46.420]
Chris, aren't you pleased with that?

[00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:47.600]
You got all of them.

[00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:48.700]
I'll be pleased about it.

[00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:48.980]
Hey, listen.

[00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:51.460]
Like I said, and I really mean this.

[00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:54.560]
I just, I sat there on the sofa last night thinking about this.

[00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:57.020]
The steam was coming out of my ears and I said to myself,

[00:26:57.020 --> 00:26:58.800]
I asked myself one question.

[00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:01.660]
The question was, what am I getting excited about?

[00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:03.580]
I mean, I already know there are a bunch of incompetent fools

[00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:05.440]
and that they're doing everything in their power to destroy

[00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:06.640]
whatever a lot of other people.

[00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:09.560]
You know, there was a great, a great moment that conversation

[00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:10.980]
with Fat jolly Joe yesterday.

[00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:13.780]
I was talking about Greg Reed, the this and the that.

[00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:15.480]
He says, well, Greg Reed is gone.

[00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:17.280]
And I said, so was the audience.

[00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:21.120]
It's funny because it's true.

[00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:24.760]
Yeah, I mean, and I hastened to add, there's no connection there.

[00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:26.780]
In other words, we didn't have an audience because Greg Reed was there.

[00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:29.200]
But nevertheless, he just gave me that opening and I couldn't resist.

[00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:31.740]
Greg Reed is gone and I said, Joe, so was the audience.

[00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:33.700]
And he, there was a moment of silence.

[00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:36.220]
822 votes on the poll.

[00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:39.320]
What's your favorite theme song from the 60s TV sitcoms?

[00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:40.380]
And leading so far?

[00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:41.220]
Oh, yeah.

[00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:42.740]
The monkeys.

[00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:46.580]
That's what I voted for.

[00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:47.740]
Mine was the first vote.

[00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:50.380]
So limited, I know that other people have such good taste like me.

[00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:51.740]
The monkeys, 119.

[00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:53.300]
The Adam's family, 96.

[00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:54.140]
Do I have that?

[00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:55.480]
Yeah, I got that.

[00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:57.920]
Beverly Hillbilly's, I don't have 94.

[00:27:58.100 --> 00:27:58.460]
You got that?

[00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:00.940]
We don't have to play all of these all over Kill some great time.

[00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:03.900]
Is that it?

[00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:06.620]
Beverly Hillbilly's?

[00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:07.000]
Yeah.

[00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:07.760]
No.

[00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:08.960]
What is that?

[00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:10.040]
I have no idea.

[00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:12.440]
Well, I'm letting you plan it for Cut the crap.

[00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:12.860]
Oh, sorry.

[00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:13.680]
Green Acres 80.

[00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:14.400]
I thought it was the...

[00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:16.040]
Next later on, we'll be playing that for a couple of hours.

[00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:17.120]
I'll just round about time.

[00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:17.760]
The hell yeah.

[00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:17.820]
The hell yeah.

[00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:19.420]
And then we'll see if Joyce approves it, but or not.

[00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:20.760]
Well, have Claret's call up Joyce.

[00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:21.700]
Hey, what do you think Joyce?

[00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:22.520]
What do you think, honey?

[00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:23.360]
No.

[00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:24.120]
We ain't acres 80.

[00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:25.340]
Gilligan's Island 69.

[00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:26.800]
The Jetson 60.

[00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:28.320]
Hogan's Hero is 53.

[00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:29.620]
The Munster is 47.

[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.140]
The Andy Griffith Show 47.

[00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:32.300]
I think I have that handy.

[00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:34.760]
Oh, I hate that show.

[00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:35.540]
Hate that theme.

[00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:38.040]
Oh, I think there was a little in Dixie on that thing.

[00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:39.300]
Get smart 40.

[00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:40.440]
Mr. Red 31.

[00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:43.080]
Now I know for a fact.

[00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:44.360]
Oh, we got Mr....

[00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:44.800]
You know something?

[00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:45.700]
I haven't played that.

[00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:48.880]
In a long time, that's going to have to Mr. Mulman.

[00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:50.080]
All right.

[00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:51.900]
Now why didn't hell have it?

[00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:52.960]
I've played that in so long.

[00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:53.380]
I don't know.

[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:54.760]
Oh, let's hope it's clean.

[00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:55.760]
Mr. Red.

[00:28:57.060 --> 00:28:58.780]
Good morning, they saw it where I may have you.

[00:28:59.180 --> 00:28:59.500]
Hello.

[00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:01.520]
Hello.

[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.020]
Good morning, they saw it where I may have you.

[00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:05.440]
Hello.

[00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:07.360]
I'm Mr. Red.

[00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:08.080]
Well, here you go.

[00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:09.520]
It sure took a long time to get to that.

[00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:12.900]
Mr. Mulman, holy cow, no wonder we're a drop a little bit.

[00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:16.120]
Once we play that again and get that mo sound on the ear,

[00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:19.040]
I had a laugh that got constant when they got mo off the morning.

[00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:19.840]
All the way, we'll say this.

[00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:21.900]
He had better numbers than we got now, which ain't so much.

[00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:24.440]
Mr. Red 31, I dream of Genie 29.

[00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:26.120]
Bewitched 10.

[00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:27.760]
That girl 9.

[00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:28.660]
Petico Junction.

[00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:31.500]
See, they're just changing.

[00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:32.600]
I hate when they do that to me.

[00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:33.800]
Petico Junction 10.

[00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:34.340]
Bewitched 10.

[00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:34.920]
That girl 9.

[00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:35.940]
My three sons 8.

[00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:38.500]
Don Grady was a robbery on my three sons.

[00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:40.920]
And he was doing furrow faucet.

[00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:44.460]
So the rumor was, you know.

[00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:48.120]
Michele's Navy 8, leaving to Bieber for the flying nun 3.

[00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:49.080]
Here's Lucy 2.

[00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:52.200]
Well, I wasn't, I don't think we even have that thing.

[00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:53.220]
Do we, from here's Lucy?

[00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:55.420]
No, I don't have it.

[00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:56.000]
Well, maybe.

[00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:57.620]
I hope not.

[00:29:58.340 --> 00:30:00.060]
I mean, I love Lucy that's loosely.

[00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:00.780]
That's another story.

[00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:02.740]
He gives it to my favorite Martian 1,

[00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:05.600]
Gomer's Piles 1, and Hazel don't have any out of 826.

[00:30:06.060 --> 00:30:07.560]
And thank goodness I don't think I got Hazel.

[00:30:09.260 --> 00:30:11.400]
We were talking for the show today about witch hazel,

[00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:12.280]
which they still make.

[00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:13.680]
I'm so pleased they didn't know that.

[00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:16.560]
Because when I was a kid boy, when he got in a skater bike,

[00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:18.460]
he always used to get out that big old,

[00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:19.900]
juggle witch hazel man,

[00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:21.800]
and just slathered it on you.

[00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:23.440]
It smelled like hell, but nevertheless.

[00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:26.020]
I don't remember whether it really worked or not.

[00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:26.800]
Was it as any good?

[00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:28.480]
I don't know, it dries you out.

[00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:30.640]
Maybe we could smear some on the transmitter.

[00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:32.080]
Some of which hazel can't hurt.

[00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:36.180]
1040, 20 to 11, it used to be great QAM,

[00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:37.320]
where they're absolutely in a,

[00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:40.200]
they're in a burn and destroy mode these days.

[00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:41.720]
They're just in a deforestation.

[00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:43.800]
Maybe we can get Jeff in deforestation.

[00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:45.660]
Because everybody hates him like poison.

[00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:46.820]
I'll probably put him back on here.

[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.780]
I've got another boring show this weekend.

[00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:50.820]
Or are you gonna get serious?

[00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:53.100]
This Saturday night on ESPN,

[00:30:53.420 --> 00:30:54.700]
it's the end of the year.

[00:30:54.860 --> 00:30:56.980]
The WWF Sissy pants!

[00:30:57.480 --> 00:30:58.160]
Wap down!

[00:30:58.900 --> 00:30:59.800]
We all need excitement.

[00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:01.200]
Now, knock it off!

[00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:02.460]
We all need energy!

[00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:04.120]
No, you knock it off!

[00:31:04.220 --> 00:31:06.120]
That's cool in the world's weakest and deep.

[00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:09.540]
It's the most obvious claim of the title of world's weakest Shitty.

[00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:11.340]
Oh wait, how can we make it?

[00:31:11.340 --> 00:31:13.920]
We'll paint the hell with the fuck on us, man!

[00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:14.640]
Ow!

[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:16.240]
The actio station!

[00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:17.740]
I'm doing my best!

[00:31:18.340 --> 00:31:19.640]
We're gonna go look here!

[00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:21.800]
Okay, then I've killed my mom!

[00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:23.880]
Please don't leave me with this!

[00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:27.060]
It's the WWF Sissy pants!

[00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:28.040]
Slap down!

[00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:31.040]
Who will claim the title and rule?

[00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:34.940]
Fight out this Saturday night on ESPN!

[00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:41.260]
That's 45 at 560 W. We're off to the races baby. This thing with the put in the people on hold this is working like a charm

[00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:42.920]
Or something they don't hold on to long, but man

[00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:48.420]
We've had more colors and the real colors in the first hour that Joe Valito he knows is crap tonight. He noted yeah

[00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:51.700]
We got the worst George none not again. Take a guess

[00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:55.940]
He's back to another choice. Yeah, I guess all that talk I don't you know wow

[00:31:55.940 --> 00:32:01.720]
This is like a whole series of these this morning started away before the show and he's just running up and down a hallway like a maniac

[00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:02.660]
Hopefully he's like a

[00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:07.180]
Little message in the hall especially right outside Joe and Clarence's orifice

[00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:10.380]
Mad dog at two we got the power hour mad dog and hang four to five

[00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:13.240]
Humpers solo five to six thirty if they have enough oxygen today

[00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:17.780]
See they just about killed him by that morning thing. I think they finished him off pretty good

[00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:20.480]
Marlins on deck at six thirty the marlins on the fillies

[00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:24.620]
705 and then game night with etiquette after the ball game after giving me the ball

[00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:31.640]
W. Q. Way and hello hello Neil. Yes, sir Johnny front day never gets that movie that part is perfect for him

[00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:35.120]
It'll make him a big star. I'm gonna run him out of the business. So let

[00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:38.240]
Like I said

[00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:40.720]
I'll try another one Q. I. M. Hello

[00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:42.400]
Yeah, Neil

[00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:49.000]
The Ethan Eastern high but that damn levittar shows pretty good. Yeah, pretty weak

[00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:55.280]
Well, what's that got to what has that have to do with this show? He's on any afternoon. What's that kind of with us?

[00:32:55.420 --> 00:32:58.320]
I know with the exception of you. I mean honestly

[00:32:59.340 --> 00:33:01.600]
That station is boring. Yeah

[00:33:02.140 --> 00:33:02.540]
and

[00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:05.440]
Okay, well, thanks for your

[00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:07.600]
Perspectations observation

[00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:13.760]
Jay and Gainesville's gotten observation he found he emailed me this on my space is a can't believe what I just heard

[00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:18.600]
You say about the banning of Bokeh's brilliant bit. I would really rip the living Mike Schmidt out of Joyce

[00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:22.120]
But what's the point? He says you know how inimately unbelievable this crap is I

[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.000]
Do it minimally know I'm glad to know

[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.280]
Inimately know that bitch because I'd probably have to get a shot

[00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:27.540]
I

[00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:30.940]
Love to show a lot but it's over says Jay my advice to you

[00:33:30.940 --> 00:33:35.840]
Which you do not need is tell Norma to pursue a buyout so you can get away from that crazy company. It's over

[00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:41.860]
He says no, it isn't over Jay the checks keep showing up. Okay, I I told Joey yesterday if they had any poem

[00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:46.500]
I'd like right me a check and say goodbye. Oh, we don't want to do that is what he said we don't want to do that

[00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:52.120]
Let's look to your audience at this point. Chase is will follow you wherever you go and all you're doing right now

[00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:56.260]
It's keeping this outfit afloat. It's like a neighbor the alcoholics if you get out of there the ghost of Robo Young

[00:33:56.260 --> 00:34:02.020]
Consulate can turn off the transmitter and nobody would notice Neil God's feats is Jay in gamesville. Thank you Jay

[00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:06.400]
Is George back from yeah? Yeah, yeah, I'm doing your Jay. I did

[00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:11.660]
Wait to hear this although you see I'm tempted to take these now

[00:34:11.660 --> 00:34:15.280]
Which is probably not a good idea because I know they won't hang on WQ. I am hello

[00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:20.360]
How do you like that?

[00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:22.380]
Chris

[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:27.200]
Well, it's got to take you a while to get it down. Yeah, that wasn't the voice that called because I know that idiot's voice

[00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:30.860]
That wasn't what I called. Oh don't tell me that they actually had somebody calling and putting

[00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:34.740]
Yeah, I'm playing the old game and I told you that they do they wouldn't be doing that

[00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:37.980]
WQ. I am hello

[00:34:38.700 --> 00:34:45.320]
Yeah, no, yes sir. Thanks for taking my call. I'm making your call sir. I still have a damn thing to say that's worth anything

[00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:46.620]
But have a nice day anyway

[00:34:48.700 --> 00:34:51.000]
Get off the phone then I

[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:55.940]
Don't need to have you people on hold there and give me a good guilty conscience because I know you're not gonna hang on and like

[00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:58.160]
Yeah, you have something breathtaking to say

[00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:02.780]
When Leo Grossinger was eight days old as parents invited their brothers and friends to a ceremony

[00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:07.620]
Welcome welcoming him into their midst as Jewish families have done for thousands of years

[00:35:07.620 --> 00:35:13.920]
They recited Hebrew blessings let candle shared wine and holly a braided bread it says holla

[00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:15.880]
holly we call it baby

[00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:23.940]
Rams with holly holly a rabbi confer to Leo's Hebrew name a seal which means created by God when the ceremony was over the guest

[00:35:23.940 --> 00:35:31.500]
Eight bagels and locks all them all the event looked a lot like any other brisk or ritual circumcision the only difference was that Leo never had this

[00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:32.360]
Shit his diaper

[00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:38.560]
I wanted to feel like connection with tradition said Leo's mother Erica Wadner and it was important to her that the baby

[00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:43.420]
Be given a Hebrew name and memory of Wadner's mother but neither Wadner nor husband Robin Grossinger

[00:35:43.420 --> 00:35:49.040]
Lend to a conflict pain and trauma on their new baby for a surgical procedure doctor say is not medically necessary

[00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:54.200]
The couple of Berkeley California among a small but growing number of American Jews who are questioning

[00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:59.160]
What is arguably the most sacred right in Judaism this but an often strong affiliation with the Jewish community

[00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:04.600]
Believe that circumcision is inconsistent with the Jewish ethical imperative not to harm another human being

[00:36:05.140 --> 00:36:07.780]
In other words don't cut like that to drop in you guys

[00:36:08.420 --> 00:36:09.040]
That one

[00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:17.440]
Once performed routine and performed routinely and nearly all newborn males in this country circumcision has become less common in recent decades

[00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:22.640]
The rate of US babies being circumcised before leaving the hospital is going for an estimated 85% in

[00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:25.020]
1965 to 57% in

[00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:28.420]
2004 in other words, there's a lot more turtles running around on the loose

[00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:31.660]
All right nothing wrong with the turtle like sweater

[00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:37.220]
But it would be difficult to overstate the significance of the practice in Jewish life even for the non-observant there are

[00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:44.960]
613 commandments in Judaism I never knew that did you nope said rabbi Moishi Kushner director of the Chicago Medical Council

[00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:52.440]
But that single commandment to circumcise is equal to the other 612 combined well sounds to me like this rabbi's got a little bit over

[00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:54.820]
I involved in that particular genital area of the

[00:36:55.380 --> 00:36:58.040]
That's the covenant baby is that what it is sure

[00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:06.400]
Without that you can have the real estate the book of Genesis mandates that every male descendant of Abraham be circumcised on the eighth day after birth

[00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:07.740]
God tells the patriarch

[00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:12.960]
This is my covenant which you shall keep any uncircumcised male who was not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin

[00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:16.520]
She'll be cut off from his people he has broken my covenant. She'll be cut off

[00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:17.140]
Don't cut

[00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:21.080]
Or should be cut off I guess is what he's trying to say

[00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:26.660]
Many Jewish parents hold a bris in the home where the cutting is done by a trained person called a loyal others

[00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:31.000]
Have the sons circumcised in the hospital is it a boy or a girl well?

[00:37:31.220 --> 00:37:34.680]
That's a boy you don't need a boy oil a Jewish boy who's not circumcised

[00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:39.440]
Kid Kushner is not totally Jewish and some advise would refuse to officiate his varmids for a wedding

[00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:45.580]
You're a guy. Okay. All of the guy am all the time and yet breaking off with what some parents have begun to view as a barbaric

[00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:46.780]
White is no longer on her though

[00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:53.000]
Brille Epstein was one year old son Arias intact said she knows at least a couple of dozen doesn't practice in Jewish families

[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:54.160]
Who don't circumcise?

[00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:59.160]
There are little in hiding she said that when people find out we didn't they come out and say oh we didn't either

[00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:02.460]
People are starting to realize it's not reading that important there lots of biblical traditions

[00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:08.160]
We no longer follow such as animal sacrifice and polygamy circumcision maybe another one we don't all follow she said

[00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:10.820]
Epstein was an Austin with her husband and two children

[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.740]
And then there's a line missing here. So I'm sure it wasn't very important honey

[00:38:14.740 --> 00:38:18.620]
It's hard to know how many Jews I'm not calling you honey. Oh, by the way speaking of that George is

[00:38:18.980 --> 00:38:22.140]
Got and taken care of now they will be done. I

[00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:26.500]
Took you. Thank you. Well, no since I had a talk to Norma Kent last night took care of all that will business, you know

[00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:30.280]
Including you and other situations all done

[00:38:30.820 --> 00:38:34.540]
Thank you. You're welcome. Well, you know I got a cry. You can die right

[00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:39.660]
It's hard to know how many Jews are giving up to practice of circumcision as statistics are not broken down by religion

[00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:45.140]
But an unscientific survey conducted recently by Mami Mami. I bet you got it by L. Zolson

[00:38:45.140 --> 00:38:46.940]
How I love you? I love you

[00:38:46.940 --> 00:38:51.540]
You don't want to hear old Mami and it's really parenting website found that 3.2% is really Jews

[00:38:51.540 --> 00:38:54.460]
No longer a circumcised healthy to be circumspect

[00:38:55.620 --> 00:38:57.800]
Isn't it yeah, well what happened?

[00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:01.500]
You're a couple listen

[00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:03.260]
Mami

[00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:09.280]
Some of the other queens are not in

[00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:11.560]
Tell you what's sucking on a bowling ball

[00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:17.400]
I'm not as old as I'm not as good though. Al is also was great back in the day when I was like a little kid

[00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:20.660]
Hundred years ago, and those 78s. Oh those were good real brittle those records

[00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:25.120]
78s. You remember that break like yeah, they're real thick and they broke real easy

[00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:29.620]
They would crack in the Chicago where the only rabbi Adam Halom of

[00:39:29.620 --> 00:39:36.000]
Kuhada Shumanistic congregation in the northern suburbs will officially that a non-cutting bris and what does that mean a non-cutting bris?

[00:39:37.540 --> 00:39:42.540]
They don't much they don't they don't slice they what maybe they just pinch it they pinch it a little bit

[00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:44.940]
Well sure wouldn't be the first time that

[00:39:44.940 --> 00:39:48.060]
Halom performs naming ceremonies for babies of both sexes

[00:39:48.060 --> 00:39:53.380]
But in his six years as rabbi in the Midwest he's done only for two baby boys whose parents decided not to circumcise

[00:39:53.380 --> 00:39:57.120]
It's definitely a minority perspective he said the decision may be more common

[00:39:57.120 --> 00:40:06.000]
There is where routine circumcision is less common nearly 80% of newborn boys are circumcised in the Midwest compared with 59% in the south and only 32%

[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:09.860]
The West 32% holy moly rat man

[00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:14.600]
Rabbi Jay Hangen who officiated Leo Grossimures alternative bris and he does about a five

[00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:18.260]
He does five a year in the San Francisco Bay Area with no cutting

[00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:21.900]
After officiating a traditional bris and monies for over three decades. I've concluded

[00:40:21.900 --> 00:40:25.300]
It's just too painful and traumatic for me to inflict on a neonate

[00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:28.600]
He said if I doubt it's something I subject myself to it as an adult

[00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:32.520]
I'm certainly not keen on reflecting it on a baby. Well, how do you like that? Right

[00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:36.880]
Of course, you know the thing with the babies you got to pull that baby out of the mother's womb

[00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:39.240]
So I guess you know you wouldn't want to do that to an adult

[00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:42.840]
Well

[00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:46.640]
Don't don't embellish that because then we'll get joy. Yeah, you know everything

[00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:52.500]
We say every idea that you think everything that might be a little bit sub-rosa as they say a little off color

[00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:55.760]
I know off key all instrumental melodies like music

[00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:59.160]
No, I think that's not going to do me and of course Jay and Gainesville

[00:40:59.160 --> 00:41:03.260]
I appreciate his sympathies before that it's over. It's not over the paychecks keep coming

[00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:07.960]
I mean when the paychecks stop coming then we'll be overall right then I'll see them in court

[00:41:09.260 --> 00:41:12.600]
866 votes and Hazel finally got one thank God for poor Hazel

[00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:18.980]
Wasn't Hazel the maid was she from like another show? Was that a spinoff? I forget. I don't know. She was a maid, right? Yes

[00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:25.600]
Well, if you look like that it'd be hard to get made. I'll tell you that monkeys are reading 121 and the animus family is a nice second 101

[00:41:26.780 --> 00:41:28.640]
Bad show by the way

[00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:36.960]
Was a Jackie Cougan was he now Jackie Cooper? No Jackie Cougan. Jackie Cougan Uncle Fester. He was the ball guy right

[00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:41.000]
Not to be confused with Al-Awe's grandpa from the monsters right

[00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:45.160]
Who's dead and didn't he die? He did that. I think so fine

[00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:49.600]
Once Howard Stern went to Sirius that was the end of Al-Awe's and then I got a call before about that too about

[00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:53.160]
Opian Anthony there should be another good lesson to you just because people are insurious

[00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:57.820]
They thought oh well. They're on satellite XM and Sirius. Well guess what they're taking the same crap

[00:41:58.860 --> 00:42:05.720]
Because this is a business of cowards of spinoffs cowards who are shaking in their boots shaking and quaking and baking and

[00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:09.480]
Snaking and making and faking. I think that's the opposite word for us

[00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:11.480]
Faking to the neo-Rodger show

[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:14.180]
This is your brain

[00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:17.220]
Don't don't don't don't any questions

[00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:21.500]
Is the moment

[00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:25.300]
You will see

[00:42:25.300 --> 00:42:26.480]
Oh

[00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:28.980]
You think

[00:42:44.980 --> 00:42:51.620]
Oh

[00:42:51.620 --> 00:43:02.560]
I think

[00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:04.300]
You

[00:43:04.300 --> 00:43:04.460]
To

[00:43:04.460 --> 00:43:04.460]

[00:43:26.780 --> 00:43:29.600]
He speaks me out of his neck,

[00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:32.000]
but that's a toy story.

[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:32.600]
He's a toy story.

[00:43:32.700 --> 00:43:33.640]
He's a toy story.

[00:43:33.780 --> 00:43:36.240]
He's a toy story.

[00:43:36.380 --> 00:43:36.760]
He's a toy story.

[00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:39.900]
He's a toy story.

[00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:40.420]
He's a toy story.

[00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:41.780]
He's a toy story.

[00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:43.860]
What's that story?

[00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:44.560]
He's a toy story.

[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:48.240]
He's a toy story.

[00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:52.340]
He's a toy story.

[00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:54.540]
Lebanon, oh, true.

[00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:55.580]
We missed those days.

[00:43:55.740 --> 00:43:56.480]
Let me tell you right now.

[00:43:56.620 --> 00:43:58.780]
Back in the days when we had an audience on this radio station.

[00:43:58.780 --> 00:44:00.520]
B.J., oh, you can't say that.

[00:44:00.620 --> 00:44:01.360]
Joyce, I'm going to tell you that.

[00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:02.600]
That's not what you think it means.

[00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:03.480]
It means before Joyce.

[00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:06.400]
Before Joyce, and before Josh Dero.

[00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:10.000]
He was there, but he didn't have his finger in the transmitter.

[00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:12.920]
In fact, back then, I think he had his finger in it.

[00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:13.040]
Right.

[00:44:13.180 --> 00:44:15.560]
Which is a lot safer place where he's concerned.

[00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:17.100]
So, what did he say to you yesterday?

[00:44:17.560 --> 00:44:20.120]
This morning from Chris was the first day I even heard about this

[00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:22.880]
little incident that occurred right before the show yesterday.

[00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:24.120]
Yeah.

[00:44:24.500 --> 00:44:25.040]
What did he say?

[00:44:25.540 --> 00:44:27.840]
He came in like what it was after the switch.

[00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:31.520]
And he said, I know this is probably the wrong time to be addressing this.

[00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:31.800]
Yes.

[00:44:31.860 --> 00:44:33.120]
We have a problem with that bit.

[00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:35.980]
What do we mean we have a problem?

[00:44:36.100 --> 00:44:37.180]
He's the one who approved it.

[00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:38.860]
He's the program director.

[00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:40.500]
He's the one who approves it.

[00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:41.860]
See, now I'm getting excited again.

[00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:42.880]
Let me do that.

[00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:44.340]
Don't do that.

[00:44:44.900 --> 00:44:47.140]
888 and the pole by the way, we'll get 1,000 of this hour.

[00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:47.940]
Yeah, go ahead.

[00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:51.040]
He came in and he said, we have a problem with that.

[00:44:51.060 --> 00:44:52.120]
You've got a problem, right?

[00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:53.880]
It's called non-compas-weeness clearance.

[00:44:54.140 --> 00:44:54.840]
That's your problem.

[00:44:55.140 --> 00:44:56.220]
Non-compas-weeness.

[00:44:56.660 --> 00:44:57.160]
And that's it.

[00:44:57.300 --> 00:44:58.840]
It made its way over to corporate.

[00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:01.920]
What do you mean it made its way?

[00:45:02.340 --> 00:45:05.020]
I don't know what he means when he says that, but that's what he said.

[00:45:05.020 --> 00:45:05.080]
What did he say?

[00:45:05.500 --> 00:45:07.400]
Did the bit cross the line?

[00:45:08.140 --> 00:45:08.980]
It hit the right.

[00:45:09.220 --> 00:45:12.100]
It hit the right on the back of a truck over there.

[00:45:12.420 --> 00:45:13.140]
It's over there.

[00:45:13.140 --> 00:45:13.580]
I do like that, man.

[00:45:13.580 --> 00:45:15.740]
It found Joyce and it got climbed upon her.

[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:16.000]

[00:45:17.860 --> 00:45:22.000]
And he said, and you know, and though they might not want you to play it anymore,

[00:45:22.340 --> 00:45:25.140]
and by that little kneel, whatever he said, they might not want us.

[00:45:25.140 --> 00:45:27.160]
They might not want you to play it anymore.

[00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:27.240]

[00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:28.680]
Or change it or something like that.

[00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:32.720]
And I know that this is, and I told him, no, this is not the time.

[00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:36.440]
And if you hit him with this now, you know, if we switch back and hit him with this now,

[00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:41.260]
there is no telling what his reaction might be up to, including, you know, just walking off.

[00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:45.600]
Just walking off.

[00:45:45.820 --> 00:45:47.460]
Yeah. I know you're going to do a shake chest.

[00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:49.620]
I got news for you. I'm not getting up and walking out.

[00:45:49.660 --> 00:45:51.720]
I'm 64 years old. I'm not some kind of a punk.

[00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:54.560]
Like I used to be years ago that's impetuous and all emotional.

[00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:55.180]
I'm going to get up.

[00:45:55.300 --> 00:45:58.200]
I'm walking out in here because you can't, you know, when you and me.

[00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:01.220]
If they want a one share, they can have it.

[00:46:01.260 --> 00:46:03.600]
If they want a no share, they can have that too.

[00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:05.460]
Because you know what? They're going to get what they deserve.

[00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:07.720]
Exactly. Between you and me, I knew that you wouldn't walk off,

[00:46:07.820 --> 00:46:10.440]
but I knew that it wouldn't be a good idea to address it right then and there.

[00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:14.000]
And probably better if they waited until after the show because of me.

[00:46:14.260 --> 00:46:18.640]
Until immediately when the show went, I wasn't even, my ass wasn't even outside the door of this little studio here.

[00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:20.680]
Because nothing else before we was getting the play.

[00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:23.960]
Even Brian Wilson was doing a good vibrations thing, man.

[00:46:24.340 --> 00:46:24.860]
What am I doing?

[00:46:25.060 --> 00:46:27.540]
And I looked at it and it was Joe Jolly, Joe Bell.

[00:46:27.540 --> 00:46:28.520]
And I thought, oh boy.

[00:46:29.700 --> 00:46:32.440]
Neil, I don't want you to play that Joyce event.

[00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:33.340]
I know far it's out.

[00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:36.120]
How is things, Neil?

[00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:36.560]
Oh, oh.

[00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:39.620]
And then he tried to get off the phone in the middle of the conversation.

[00:46:39.860 --> 00:46:41.580]
I gave him a, is today would buy in one day?

[00:46:41.820 --> 00:46:43.580]
Oh, no, it's not would buy in Monday.

[00:46:43.740 --> 00:46:45.460]
Joe, there is no such thing as would buy in Monday.

[00:46:45.580 --> 00:46:47.880]
Okay? You goofballed. You silly person you.

[00:46:49.460 --> 00:46:54.820]
A woman blames the devil and not her husband for severely burning their infant daughter after the two-month-old was put in a microwave.

[00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:57.760]
A Houston TV station reporter. This is in Galveston, Texas.

[00:46:58.340 --> 00:47:00.200]
And Glenn Campbell is singing Galveston.

[00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:01.620]
Oh God, what a bad song.

[00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:02.400]
You got it?

[00:47:02.660 --> 00:47:04.520]
Yeah, but I don't want to, I have to open up the thing.

[00:47:04.520 --> 00:47:06.040]
Oh, don't do it then. Good.

[00:47:06.900 --> 00:47:07.880]
Even Marie Maldon.

[00:47:08.560 --> 00:47:10.600]
No relation to Ken Maldon. Not spelled the same way anyway.

[00:47:10.640 --> 00:47:12.520]
How's Ken doing, by the way? He's a great guy. How's Ken?

[00:47:12.620 --> 00:47:13.360]
I still see it. He's fine.

[00:47:13.860 --> 00:47:14.480]
Good. Seems fine.

[00:47:14.860 --> 00:47:15.280]
Love you, Ken.

[00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:17.560]
Even Marie Maldon said Satan.

[00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:19.940]
And by the way, the message from what's his name?

[00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:20.520]
What was his name?

[00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:21.360]
J and Gainesville.

[00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:22.920]
That was only one of a couple of emails.

[00:47:23.140 --> 00:47:27.080]
The professor, I can't read his email because every other word was an expletive, okay?

[00:47:27.700 --> 00:47:32.100]
It was like, uh, that screw them and the beesleys and Joyce and things like that.

[00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:33.540]
A lot of people are really pissed off.

[00:47:33.540 --> 00:47:35.940]
And I don't blame them, but you know what? Let them be pissed off.

[00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:37.680]
I'm saying calm is can be.

[00:47:37.940 --> 00:47:41.480]
I'm as cool as a cucumber in deal pickle form.

[00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:44.460]
Isn't the cucumber like pickle?

[00:47:45.140 --> 00:47:45.600]
Correct.

[00:47:46.080 --> 00:47:46.940]
Oh, pickle is a cucumber.

[00:47:49.560 --> 00:47:50.080]
What?

[00:47:51.920 --> 00:47:53.120]
Pickles are made from cucumbers.

[00:47:54.440 --> 00:47:55.160]
Come on.

[00:47:55.740 --> 00:47:59.900]
Even Marie Maldon said Satan compelled her 19-year-old husband Joshua Royce Maldon

[00:47:59.900 --> 00:48:01.900]
to microwave their daughter May 10th.

[00:48:01.900 --> 00:48:03.480]
Satan saw my husband as a threat.

[00:48:03.900 --> 00:48:06.080]
Satan attacked him because he saw Joshua as a threat.

[00:48:06.460 --> 00:48:08.380]
Even Maldon told the Houston TV station.

[00:48:08.820 --> 00:48:12.180]
A Galveston County Grand jury and died of Joshua Maldon last week on Child and Recharges.

[00:48:12.580 --> 00:48:15.420]
After hearing evidence, he placed his daughter in the microwave for a few seconds.

[00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:17.900]
The infant, Anna Marie, remains hospitalized.

[00:48:18.560 --> 00:48:20.700]
She suffered burns on the left side of her face and her left hand.

[00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:22.040]
He nuked her a little bit.

[00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:24.840]
19-year-old husband Mayas, okay?

[00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:27.840]
Even Marie, the girls 20-year-old mother, told the TV station.

[00:48:28.040 --> 00:48:30.320]
Their husband is not the monster of people to make him mount to be.

[00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:31.520]
That was not my husband.

[00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:32.820]
My husband is a wonderful father.

[00:48:33.020 --> 00:48:36.980]
She said Satan was working through his weaknesses right to devil-made him do it.

[00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:39.120]
Just like probably what happened to Joyce over there with that bit.

[00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:41.700]
You know what I'm talking about?

[00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:43.420]
Yeah, I'm another one.

[00:48:45.340 --> 00:48:46.800]
In fact, I'm looking for it.

[00:48:46.860 --> 00:48:48.420]
I think it like weedled it so here it is.

[00:48:48.660 --> 00:48:50.980]
Ain't no thought sounds anymore.

[00:48:51.860 --> 00:48:53.080]
I can't hear that no more.

[00:48:53.240 --> 00:48:54.520]
I just forgot to tell you something.

[00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:57.180]
Just like that thing with the I-95 of the whole song.

[00:48:59.500 --> 00:49:04.640]
Eva Maldon described these weaknesses as an undisclosed mental disability in that efforts to get help from a failed.

[00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:07.760]
He's a crazy person which is very well qualified to make babies.

[00:49:07.980 --> 00:49:11.180]
You know, one thing about making babies, it doesn't require a tremendous amount of skill.

[00:49:11.420 --> 00:49:11.760]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:49:12.460 --> 00:49:17.160]
Yeah, the police say Joshua Maldon told him and sometimes you don't even want to be making one and you make one, George.

[00:49:17.540 --> 00:49:21.800]
The police say Joshua Maldon told him he put an anemory in the microwave because he was under stress.

[00:49:22.500 --> 00:49:23.820]
He was under stress.

[00:49:24.320 --> 00:49:28.360]
Eva Maldon, who met her husband in Arkansas Church, denied the claims by police.

[00:49:29.740 --> 00:49:31.620]
He would never do anything to hurt her.

[00:49:31.700 --> 00:49:33.240]
He loves her when she cries.

[00:49:33.420 --> 00:49:35.000]
He's the one who comforts her.

[00:49:35.460 --> 00:49:41.940]
When she is sick, he is the one who puts her in the microwave oven for a little while to kill the disease.

[00:49:42.860 --> 00:49:46.860]
Joshua of Horn, Arkansas came to Galveston with his wife and mother because he was called to be a preacher.

[00:49:47.180 --> 00:49:47.600]
All right!

[00:49:48.200 --> 00:49:49.280]
He's a preacher man.

[00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:53.080]
Son of a preacher man, isn't that by a Bobby Gentry? Son of a preacher man?

[00:49:53.180 --> 00:49:53.540]
I think so.

[00:49:53.900 --> 00:49:55.860]
Everything comes back to son of a silly ass song.

[00:49:56.380 --> 00:49:59.640]
That's one of the good things about being an old fart like me is you've been around long enough.

[00:49:59.780 --> 00:50:02.800]
You know all of them old silly ass songs like Son of a preacher man.

[00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:04.760]
What about Old Debili Jo with Robbie Benson?

[00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:05.980]
What about it?

[00:50:06.220 --> 00:50:07.320]
Jumped off with Bobby Gentry.

[00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:09.080]
You're not going to play any of these now?

[00:50:09.260 --> 00:50:10.820]
I'm opening it up back up.

[00:50:10.820 --> 00:50:13.020]
Oh, I had to add some tunes to it.

[00:50:13.940 --> 00:50:14.400]
Like what?

[00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:17.060]
Like the I dream of Genie theme, which is what I voted for.

[00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:19.280]
You didn't have to do that?

[00:50:20.080 --> 00:50:21.720]
You don't think I've got that here somewhere?

[00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:22.700]
I wanted it.

[00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:25.660]
I want to have it in the collection over here.

[00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:29.420]
I might have to do a show someday if the tapes don't work.

[00:50:29.440 --> 00:50:30.000]
I wanted it.

[00:50:30.220 --> 00:50:30.760]
I wanted it.

[00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:31.400]
Yeah, okay. Good.

[00:50:31.620 --> 00:50:32.480]
Everybody wanted it.

[00:50:33.320 --> 00:50:34.800]
I can think of some people like that.

[00:50:34.940 --> 00:50:35.580]
Everybody wants them.

[00:50:35.900 --> 00:50:36.880]
Now, what am I looking for?

[00:50:36.980 --> 00:50:38.460]
I dream of Genie.

[00:50:38.580 --> 00:50:40.060]
Dun-dun-dun-dun.

[00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:42.680]
I don't see it.

[00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:44.060]
That's the witch I'm singing anyway.

[00:50:44.420 --> 00:50:44.520]
Right.

[00:50:45.260 --> 00:50:47.460]
I want everybody knows, be witch.

[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:53.600]
Oh, there's ultimately Joe Bobby Gentry.

[00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:01.880]
Where's the I dream of?

[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:04.880]
I was out chopping cotton in my brother.

[00:51:05.120 --> 00:51:05.620]
Cotton cotton.

[00:51:11.040 --> 00:51:12.720]
Oh, the band Joe went in the right.

[00:51:12.720 --> 00:51:16.220]
I think that's the 10th of the circus or the county or whatever it was.

[00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:17.860]
He did all that guy in there.

[00:51:17.940 --> 00:51:20.660]
Oh, yeah.

[00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:22.880]
He was dealing with a guy in the 10th.

[00:51:23.100 --> 00:51:24.220]
And it was kind of tense about it.

[00:51:24.300 --> 00:51:25.700]
So he jumped off the town I had to bridge.

[00:51:26.060 --> 00:51:27.180]
And he'd never been seeing no more.

[00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:29.960]
There we go.

[00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:32.040]
That's a good thing.

[00:51:32.160 --> 00:51:32.860]
It's a great show.

[00:51:33.220 --> 00:51:34.060]
I thought I'd vote it for it.

[00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:34.780]
Oh, good.

[00:51:34.900 --> 00:51:35.920]
But I did like the monkey statement.

[00:51:35.920 --> 00:51:36.840]
I almost voted for it.

[00:51:37.100 --> 00:51:38.720]
Well, that seems to be leading away so far.

[00:51:38.820 --> 00:51:39.400]
Nothing wrong with that.

[00:51:39.460 --> 00:51:39.940]
Here we come.

[00:51:40.440 --> 00:51:41.020]
The monkeys.

[00:51:42.120 --> 00:51:45.480]
We'll see Amy Jones and Mickey Golems and Peter Dorke.

[00:51:45.600 --> 00:51:45.900]
Torque.

[00:51:46.620 --> 00:51:49.100]
And I left one out and Mickey Golems.

[00:51:49.380 --> 00:51:49.820]
Do I say it?

[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:55.500]
They were good.

[00:51:55.580 --> 00:51:57.120]
They were all ugly, but they were pretty good.

[00:51:57.700 --> 00:51:59.420]
So anyway, this story about the microwave.

[00:51:59.980 --> 00:52:04.180]
She's hoping whatever her name is, even to be reunited with her daughter.

[00:52:04.180 --> 00:52:08.500]
But child protective services is working at her in Joshua's parental rights terminated.

[00:52:08.500 --> 00:52:10.200]
I think we should have them terminate.

[00:52:10.300 --> 00:52:11.420]
Doesn't sound like a winning idea.

[00:52:11.780 --> 00:52:12.240]
Sounds great.

[00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:12.600]
Sounds great to me.

[00:52:14.240 --> 00:52:14.600]
Joyce.

[00:52:15.540 --> 00:52:15.900]
Bitch.

[00:52:16.580 --> 00:52:19.100]
See, one thing about that is I don't care how offended she is.

[00:52:19.260 --> 00:52:22.220]
Well, then the other comment that was dropped in the early part of this conversation was,

[00:52:22.500 --> 00:52:25.320]
well, they're worried about, you know, defamation soon.

[00:52:25.660 --> 00:52:26.960]
Like, she's the corporate lawyer.

[00:52:27.100 --> 00:52:29.000]
She's going to sue the company that she's working for.

[00:52:29.280 --> 00:52:30.080]
Give me up, Ray.

[00:52:30.300 --> 00:52:31.340]
You have to get a license first.

[00:52:31.980 --> 00:52:32.680]
Give me a break.

[00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:33.040]

[00:52:33.420 --> 00:52:34.180]
Nice job on it.

[00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:37.740]
How it's turned thing to, by the way, Joyce, there was excellent, excellent choice on your part.

[00:52:38.380 --> 00:52:39.580]
Excellent choice by Joyce.

[00:52:40.480 --> 00:52:41.740]
I'm ready to lose my voice.

[00:52:43.540 --> 00:52:44.260]
908 on the pool.

[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:46.740]
I'm only going to read the ones with, uh, incontention.

[00:52:47.980 --> 00:52:50.000]
Favorite theme song from a 60s TV sitcom.

[00:52:50.340 --> 00:52:52.700]
Poll seems to be going over pretty big, bigger than Mary Tallah Moore.

[00:52:54.020 --> 00:52:56.500]
Now, she's not the first of all she was in the 60s.

[00:52:56.560 --> 00:52:58.260]
Was that the, I guess it was a sitcom, bad one.

[00:52:58.840 --> 00:53:00.760]
That's back when we did the 70s one a few weeks ago.

[00:53:00.860 --> 00:53:01.160]
Remember that?

[00:53:01.320 --> 00:53:01.480]
Right.

[00:53:01.900 --> 00:53:02.460]
I'm sure you do.

[00:53:03.460 --> 00:53:04.440]
But it wasn't like this.

[00:53:10.920 --> 00:53:11.340]
Oh, yeah.

[00:53:11.340 --> 00:53:14.440]
Or speaking of me, which, that's all over the place.

[00:53:14.820 --> 00:53:15.620]
Well, I just got through planning.

[00:53:16.260 --> 00:53:18.700]
Anyway, monkeys 131, the Adams family 108.

[00:53:19.160 --> 00:53:19.860]
It's kind of great.

[00:53:20.360 --> 00:53:21.440]
Beverly Hill believes 102.

[00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:22.560]
Green Acres 92.

[00:53:23.340 --> 00:53:24.560]
Gilligan's Island 80th Shoei.

[00:53:24.700 --> 00:53:26.080]
Did I just got through playing Gilligan's Island?

[00:53:26.580 --> 00:53:28.080]
I played like about four seconds of it.

[00:53:28.340 --> 00:53:28.940]
What was I doing?

[00:53:29.860 --> 00:53:31.780]
I was just like, did you know what I was doing?

[00:53:31.780 --> 00:53:32.480]
Now, what was his name?

[00:53:32.480 --> 00:53:35.000]
He always, I always think of him as Jim neighbors, but I know he was.

[00:53:35.240 --> 00:53:36.960]
Bob Denver, he was very annoying to me.

[00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:37.540]
I don't know what it was.

[00:53:37.620 --> 00:53:38.920]
He just was extremely annoying.

[00:53:39.960 --> 00:53:40.980]
You don't think he was annoying?

[00:53:41.540 --> 00:53:41.740]
No.

[00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:44.160]
You like that Joe Gilligan's Island?

[00:53:44.260 --> 00:53:44.400]
No.

[00:53:44.780 --> 00:53:46.580]
Oh, well, thank God for that.

[00:53:47.120 --> 00:53:48.660]
Thank God for his small favors, okay?

[00:53:48.940 --> 00:53:50.540]
That's what I say in the shower every day.

[00:53:50.800 --> 00:53:51.640]
Oh, sorry, Joe.

[00:53:51.840 --> 00:53:52.140]
It's a secret.

[00:53:52.640 --> 00:53:53.720]
Thank God for his small favor.

[00:53:53.860 --> 00:53:54.340]
You, Roger.

[00:53:54.520 --> 00:53:54.940]
You, Roger.

[00:53:55.300 --> 00:53:56.520]
And actually, party favor, Joe.

[00:53:56.920 --> 00:53:57.460]
Who's with you?

[00:53:57.600 --> 00:53:58.020]
A facetome.

[00:53:58.140 --> 00:53:58.460]
That's it.

[00:53:59.160 --> 00:54:03.820]
Saturday morning, join four Winkle J-Moses and his bully buddies, Sadam Hussein.

[00:54:03.860 --> 00:54:04.340]
