[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.280]
A lot like hot little boys, I'm like a moron.

[00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:04.980]
Listen now.

[00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:08.380]
Every time he sees me, it's the way God wants to speak.

[00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.360]
He wants to take the city and cover it in the sweet.

[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:12.660]
Raynagan can.

[00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:14.560]
Raynagan can.

[00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:16.780]
Raynagan can.

[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.220]
Raynagan can, cause he wants to make you or leave peace.

[00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:25.900]
And I don't care what people are saying.

[00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:27.300]
Just like Jesse Jackson.

[00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:28.960]
We as black people.

[00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.560]
It's coming, it's coming.

[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.540]
Surely God is man.

[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.740]
He compares the locals to a willy-wonka bar.

[00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:36.300]
Chocolate.

[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:38.640]
Raynagan can.

[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.020]
Yes, Raynagan can.

[00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.440]
Raynagan can.

[00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.460]
Cause he wants to make you or leave peace.

[00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:47.960]
Good.

[00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.040]
It's time for us to come together.

[00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.820]
It's time for us to rebuild a New Orleans.

[00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.760]
The one that should be uptown or wherever they are.

[00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.320]
This city will be chocolate.

[00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.280]
A chocolate New Orleans.

[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.040]
He never takes the blame for anything.

[00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.580]
Chocolate at the end of the chocolate.

[00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.340]
That chocolate ends up causing the end of all bond.

[00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.220]
All this Raynagan can.

[00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.060]
Raynagan can.

[00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.140]
No, I can.

[00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:24.480]
Raynagan can.

[00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.660]
Cause he wants to make you or leave peace.

[00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.320]
You can't have New Orleans.

[00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:31.240]
No other way.

[00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.880]
No other way.

[00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.940]
It doesn't mean it.

[00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.560]
It doesn't mean it.

[00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.600]
It doesn't mean it.

[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.780]
It doesn't mean it.

[00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:34.260]
It doesn't mean it.

[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.540]
And there's the candy man for you.

[00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.780]
It's a 10.02 at 5.60 W.A.M.

[00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.220]
Let's go to Nallian's Nott.

[00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:40.700]
It was a toilet before Katrina.

[00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.980]
And now it's a real toilet.

[00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.280]
And because he did such a pathetic, embarrassing job.

[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.340]
And not all those people go to the convention center of the stadium.

[00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.940]
And because he did such a stupid job.

[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.020]
He and Brownie Brownie out of both have been tired and feathered and run out of town.

[00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.120]
Brownie Brownie out of both have been tired and feathered and run out of town.

[00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.720]
Hey, we got some tar for him.

[00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.720]
That's right.

[00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:58.300]
We got the tar.

[00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.980]
You bring the feathers.

[00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.080]
We got the tar, baby.

[00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.600]
But anyway.

[00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:03.720]
Let's start with that again.

[00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:04.200]
You know what I mean?

[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.640]
I don't care.

[00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.420]
Cause there's all the dark folks in Nallian's.

[00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.920]
In America, doesn't care about dark folks or black folks, brown folks, uh, po folks.

[00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:12.420]
Let's go to po folks.

[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.020]
I'll get the red soup and you get the white soup.

[00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.820]
Okay.

[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.460]
Are they still in business, po folks?

[00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.340]
I haven't seen them for a long time.

[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.500]
Well, boy, maybe that's maybe there's only a good around you.

[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:22.960]
An optimist.

[00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.280]
Huh?

[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.260]
Things are looking up, man.

[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.320]
Here's the poll from yesterday.

[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.760]
Oh, and the best news of all.

[00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.860]
It just, even though I lost my answer, would buy me yesterday.

[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:31.920]
No good machines, man.

[00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.160]
Oh, oh, rather.

[00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.500]
Woo.

[00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:34.320]
Not good.

[00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.960]
But anyway.

[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.300]
Uh, what was I about to say?

[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.000]
Oh, yeah, the good news.

[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.340]
Ah!

[00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.960]
Really good news.

[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.480]
130.

[00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.580]
Yeah.

[00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:43.600]
Hurricane's warm up at 130.

[00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:44.760]
Cause we got to get the half hour.

[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.400]
And I see there's a lot of spots in that half hour.

[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.300]
So that's all I care about.

[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.240]
As long as we get a lot of spots in there, we can get that hurricane pregame show.

[00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.520]
And who the hell lots of hearing the arrangers till 2 o'clock?

[00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.400]
And we sure don't want to be here till 2 o'clock, do we?

[00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.860]
No.

[00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.640]
No way Jose.

[00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:57.200]
Or hey.

[00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.000]
So Hurricane warm up at 130.

[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.640]
Hanson Merrill and the two at the ACC Touring and Tampa.

[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.620]
Oh, I've got your clarances over there right now.

[00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:05.240]
Hyperventilating.

[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:06.920]
Like that.

[00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.500]
Which Jose Gaki and of course everybody knows.

[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:10.840]
Jose Gaki sucks.

[00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.540]
But anyway, then we got to after the ballgame.

[00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.220]
The power hour with Hank all by himself.

[00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.380]
Because again, mad dog ain't coming in for, you know, for half an hour.

[00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.960]
A high paid guy like him, Big Shot X, Jack, uh, Showered Naked with the Boys.

[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.080]
He sure not coming in for a half hour by himself.

[00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:28.440]
So the power hour with Hank kept the ballgaming and the Hank till 630.

[00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.980]
See, if we had a program director and any brains, he wouldn't call it the power hour.

[00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.460]
Because if there's only one person there, it's guy, he's an idiot.

[00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.180]
But then again, he's at the basketball game.

[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.880]
Then you got your Panthers preview at 630.

[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.660]
The Panthers at the pathetic Philadelphia Flyers at 7 o'clock tonight.

[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.360]
That's again the Panthers ought to be able to win.

[00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.440]
In fact, blindfolded without their skates on.

[00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:50.660]
The Flyers suck.

[00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:55.180]
I mean, I hate to put it in such grotesque terms that the flyer flyers blow.

[00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.060]
Here's the pole from yesterday's show.

[00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.120]
That's right, yesterday we worked a whole four hours.

[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.660]
I don't like that.

[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.220]
And tomorrow, of course, the good news is the ratings, the trends.

[00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.060]
It's November, December and January.

[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.200]
Even though it's already the March the 9th tomorrow, but it's because those first two weeks of January, there's no ratings.

[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.960]
Right.

[00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.560]
And so when you get to these early in the year trends are like pushed back.

[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.920]
So it's whatever it is.

[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:20.040]
Anybody care about those?

[00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.260]
Oh.

[00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.000]
I sure I'm sure the morning show is going to be watching that very carefully.

[00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:24.340]
They're going to have their eye out.

[00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.260]
Like, you know, Columbo and Sammy Davis are going to keep an eye on it.

[00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.860]
Since you always offers us good advice, I was going to offer Neil one piece advice would be.

[00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.840]
1353 votes and Neil doesn't need advice.

[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:36.680]
He knows it all.

[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.580]
436.

[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.040]
Almost a 30-the-audience think that I know it all.

[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.840]
Only if only.

[00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.420]
You know what I mean?

[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.940]
Yeah.

[00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.340]
Don't ever retire at 222.

[00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:47.380]
Well, I'm not going to retire.

[00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:48.620]
I'm going to keep working until I quote.

[00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:50.900]
But Norma Kent doesn't know that.

[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.020]
And Joe Bellas knows that.

[00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.280]
And the Beasley's don't know that.

[00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:54.740]
But that's what I've been telling people.

[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:55.720]
I'm staying here.

[00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:56.380]
You know something.

[00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.580]
Even if they don't put the show on, I'm going to keep coming in here and doing a show every day.

[00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.680]
Even if I'm just talking to myself and some days I feel like I am anyway.

[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:03.480]
What?

[00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:05.820]
Make the move to Savley, 215.

[00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.260]
Okay, I'm moving right now.

[00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.760]
I'm on a chair.

[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:08.600]
I'm rolling a little bit.

[00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:09.280]
I'm making the move.

[00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.680]
Okay.

[00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:10.800]
I'm making the move in my chair.

[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.760]
Ooh, look at that.

[00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:14.280]
Stay the hell off my space, 161.

[00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.260]
There are two chances of that happening.

[00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:17.900]
Much less than none and zero.

[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:18.880]
And minus infinity.

[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:20.400]
I enjoy my space.

[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:21.820]
I've got some wonderful friends on there.

[00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:24.500]
And, you know, well, then I had one guy with a...

[00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:25.200]
I look at the...

[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.400]
You know, when people ask to be added, we have 256...

[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:29.960]
1256 friends.

[00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.280]
And when they ask to be added, I was...

[00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:33.680]
The one thing I do is I look at the profile.

[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.000]
If it's on like 13-year-old kid, I deleted immediately.

[00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.180]
If it's anybody underage.

[00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:38.540]
And then there's this one guy.

[00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:40.380]
I figure it was his name, Billy Bob or some crap.

[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.260]
And he's got a swastika on there.

[00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:43.060]
You know, and his profile.

[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.280]
Well, gee, how come you haven't added me, Uncle Lioba?

[00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:48.560]
Because you were a Nazi ambassador.

[00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:50.700]
We already got Nazi bastards running the country.

[00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:53.280]
We don't need any Nazi bachelors in our MySpace page.

[00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.260]
You Nazi Bachelors don't rule you.

[00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:57.840]
Stay off MySpace 161, no chance.

[00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:58.800]
Stay off the ice cream.

[00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:00.120]
Maybe I've been doing that very well.

[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:03.440]
And by the way, 182 today, I backslided, I backslided upon.

[00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:04.580]
Not because I ate anything.

[00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:05.700]
You backslide just...

[00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:06.800]
I backslided.

[00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:07.740]
Well, that's the water thing.

[00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:08.660]
You know, the water balance.

[00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:10.540]
Right.

[00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:12.240]
When it's that time of the month, you know, I retain water.

[00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:12.800]
I say, 80.

[00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:14.120]
It's not what I'm supposed to say.

[00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.220]
Well, I'll get there.

[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:15.820]
Believe you me.

[00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:16.880]
Trust me when I tell you.

[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:18.720]
I will get there.

[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:19.060]
I'll be there.

[00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:22.080]
In fact, the next time I come down there, I'll be like in a low...

[00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:23.140]
I'll be 170-ish.

[00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:24.060]
I'm going to be so slim.

[00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:25.700]
It will be just disgusting.

[00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:26.640]
Oh, regardless.

[00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:27.320]
I'll be disgusting.

[00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:29.900]
Move back to 90-59.

[00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:31.540]
There is no chance.

[00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:33.080]
There isn't a chance in a hill.

[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:36.280]
If somebody gave me a certified check from million dollars and said,

[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:38.520]
okay, you already got a house here in plantation.

[00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:39.420]
Just move back.

[00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:41.900]
I would say, uh-uh.

[00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:43.000]
No, thank you.

[00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.080]
I asked the cameo vetist and goodbye.

[00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:46.640]
Return now, 54.

[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:47.340]
Retire!

[00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:47.740]
No.

[00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:49.620]
Go straight, 51.

[00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:50.220]
Oh, yeah.

[00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:53.740]
I hit this poll 47ly, 3.4 percent and stopped gambling.

[00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.300]
I should've heated that.

[00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:56.420]
That's right down there in the bottom.

[00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:58.840]
If more of you would've voted for that, you could've saved me a lot of money yesterday.

[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:04.340]
And believe me, it breaks my heart because that money could've gone towards something a lot more constructed,

[00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:06.600]
toward many things more constructed, of anything.

[00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:08.380]
But it just would've been.

[00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:09.660]
There are a bunch of themes over there.

[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.360]
You'll loan it, it takes you many excursions.

[00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:12.400]
Nobody drug me out there.

[00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:13.520]
You know, nobody dragged me.

[00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:16.080]
28 votes for stopped gambling.

[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:17.120]
Out of 1353.

[00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:18.080]
So that's yesterday's.

[00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:20.960]
Wait till you hear Doug Thompson's commentary today from Capitol Hill Blue.

[00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:23.040]
You know what the headline is?

[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:23.720]
I give up.

[00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:25.460]
Bergen Hell, Mr. President.

[00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:26.060]
Oh, right.

[00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:30.480]
Yeah, not that he, you know, is angry or, you know, Doug Thompson minces his words.

[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:33.760]
A lot of people are minced like freaky cargo south-earthed front desk.

[00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:37.480]
827 votes on a day's poll.

[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:38.740]
Chris, you can relax.

[00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:40.680]
Even though we get out of here earlier, 130.

[00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:41.400]
Oh, look at this.

[00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:43.760]
They made Rob Hammerhand the anchor now in scene.

[00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:44.480]
He's a true surrac.

[00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:45.760]
The surface military police.

[00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:49.240]
There's a lot of ladies out there and a lot of queens, you know, who are just all obsessed

[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:49.620]
with Rob.

[00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:50.660]
He looked pretty good there today.

[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:52.220]
Probably got a lot of makeup on.

[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:54.520]
But they made it into an anchor.

[00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:57.460]
I mean, why waste his talents in the front of the weather map when he can be sitting

[00:07:57.460 --> 00:07:58.900]
there like staring right in the screen.

[00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:01.260]
Oh, Rob, you know, like that.

[00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:01.960]
He's all right.

[00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:04.480]
820.

[00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:07.700]
In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if the guy with the eyes gave up his David Cassidy blow

[00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:09.840]
up down on that Rob Hammerhand's anchoring on CNN.

[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:12.820]
827 votes on a poll.

[00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:14.780]
What do you miss most about your youth?

[00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:16.520]
Now have we added this one?

[00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:17.080]
No, we haven't.

[00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:18.340]
Ron says my stamina.

[00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:20.200]
And he says, not just for sex.

[00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:22.120]
I can't stay awake past 10 o'clock anymore.

[00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:22.620]
It says Ron.

[00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:25.700]
Yeah, as you get older, you don't, you're not one of those people that stays up till

[00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:26.500]
the wee hours of the morning.

[00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:27.640]
I just, I can't handle that.

[00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:28.100]
Not good.

[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:31.980]
Although it's for our stamina for sex.

[00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:33.840]
I'm not really sure I know what that means, you know.

[00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:38.900]
Maybe he needs some of that, you know, medication we advertise all the time.

[00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:41.800]
Some of the medication that we have 80 million sponsor for, the ones that I keep getting

[00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:46.480]
all this span, oh brother, if I don't get at least 4,000 span emails for that stuff

[00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:47.120]
every day.

[00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:48.900]
ED problems, yeah, I got your ED.

[00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:50.740]
ED atoms.

[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:52.480]
ED Gorm.

[00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:56.440]
I'm trying to think of who it was that once said that, called ED Gorma, ED Gorm.

[00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:00.360]
But anyway, what do you miss most about your youth?

[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:03.200]
838 votes.

[00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:06.580]
Isn't it amazing how with all these stupid things, then you might audio punk that.

[00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:07.500]
There are new young people.

[00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:11.100]
When you get to be an old fossil like me, you remember all this stupid crap and you

[00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:12.720]
wish that you'd get out of your mind, you know.

[00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:13.180]
Clear.

[00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:17.300]
You wish you'd clear your memory so that you knew where your address was and where you left

[00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:19.700]
the keys and where your car docked parts and stuff like that.

[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.040]
Although you don't have to worry about Florida where your car is parked because you get

[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:23.160]
one of them flower antennas.

[00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:24.220]
My head, one of those.

[00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:26.400]
ED Gorma, what are everybody else's that want to do?

[00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:28.480]
ED Gorma, what if everybody else has the same flower?

[00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:29.660]
ED Gorma, yeah, but it's not the same one.

[00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:30.740]
You get your own unique flower.

[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:31.140]
ED Gorma, yeah.

[00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:32.440]
Then you know where you're parked the car.

[00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:33.420]
I want to hide biscuits.

[00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:36.920]
ED Gorma, miss most about your youth sex with young people my own age, 170.

[00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:39.640]
ED Gorma, what's wrong with sex people not my own age.

[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:40.800]
I'm wondering about that.

[00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:46.240]
Being irresponsible had no real consequences, 142.

[00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:50.540]
But when I sure wish I could turn a clock back man and be irresponsible.

[00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:52.380]
My body, 125.

[00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:54.960]
Yeah, my body when I was younger wasn't, yeah, it was okay.

[00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:56.460]
And certainly a lot better than this.

[00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:59.400]
And now that I'm losing this weight, you know how when you get old you don't exercise.

[00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:03.520]
Even when, even if you do exercise, you get all this flap, it's just flap now.

[00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:04.320]
It's just hanging it.

[00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:04.560]
ED Gorma, right.

[00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:06.060]
I need it chopped off.

[00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:07.760]
Real music, 77.

[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:08.400]
Oh yeah.

[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:12.880]
I remember those days real music, not this swill, this garbised, this crap pola.

[00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:15.460]
Oh, we had payola, now we got crapola.

[00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:16.480]
Look what pop had.

[00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:18.060]
Pop had jenko, look what we got.

[00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:21.060]
Another godfives.

[00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:23.400]
Fourth ringer.

[00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:24.960]
I think he could have been 100 people.

[00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:29.980]
I just swear at that.

[00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:32.540]
Dancer is one thing you're following all over the floor.

[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:33.200]
What?

[00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:34.200]
It's the matter with you.

[00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:36.140]
I think it's just the real man.

[00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:42.760]
Oh, you can bet your mama.

[00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:44.620]
Anyway, real music is 78.

[00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:45.640]
My hair is 62.

[00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:46.960]
Being single 56.

[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:50.880]
American Americans were mostly like the broad 40 at all over the world.

[00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:53.900]
All they loved Americans once upon a time before EW.

[00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:54.460]
EW.

[00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:57.540]
Being ignorant, as ignorance is bliss 37.

[00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:00.100]
I hate this poll 35, 4% and adding to that.

[00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:02.260]
Real radio, I voted for that 26.

[00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:03.460]
Remember when radio was radio.

[00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:06.500]
When men were men and women were women and radio was radio.

[00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:12.480]
See, I just played that clip and right away Brandon's got an email on here immediately.

[00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:14.580]
You are such a godfather, groupie, Brandon.

[00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:16.300]
You're going to get a spanking pretty soon.

[00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:18.220]
Segregation 24.

[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:21.380]
Being in school and actually learning something 23, I don't remember that.

[00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:22.960]
I remember being in school but not learning it.

[00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:25.380]
The cold war, at least we knew who the enemy was 11.

[00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:25.860]
That's right.

[00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:28.980]
If you had no idea who the enemy was and now, forget about it.

[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:32.380]
You got the soonies and the curbs and the shears and all the other crap.

[00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:34.500]
The insurgents, the Taliban.

[00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:39.040]
Real newspaper 7, I remember where, and my stamina to 857.

[00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:40.620]
Just went on there, it's all they got up here.

[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:43.980]
Maybe that's what Ray needs a new pair.

[00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:47.320]
Oh look at this, man burns genitals in jackass stuff.

[00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:49.000]
Look, there's a whole bunch of good stuff here.

[00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:49.720]
The others.

[00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:52.400]
Idahoans call capital and Jesus' senses.

[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:54.460]
Well, there's all kinds of great stuff on here.

[00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:55.320]
Man, I should kill some of you.

[00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:56.280]
I mean, it'll be really entertaining.

[00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:57.420]
I know, well, that's right.

[00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:58.080]
Make it, baby.

[00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:00.160]
Enter the 560 to 8M.

[00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:03.400]
See Cruise contest and join us for it, hold the alert.

[00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:04.000]
Fire!

[00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:04.780]
Fire!

[00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:08.080]
You'll be far away from women on this cruise.

[00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:10.920]
It's an all-inclusive sports-vanade cruise.

[00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:13.520]
Exclusively for men who talk about men.

[00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:16.980]
To be around nothing but men aboard the drag star eyeliner.

[00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:18.260]
Yo ho ho ho!

[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:21.560]
This is the way 2AM General Manager Joe will be.

[00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:22.800]
Yo ho ho, Bell!

[00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:24.120]
Ho ho ho!

[00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:28.240]
You know there's nothing quite like a manly sport-hold cruise.

[00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:31.020]
Especially if you want to hide for women.

[00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:34.720]
They don't serve seafood if this all you can eat buffet.

[00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:36.420]
Only sausage.

[00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:37.420]
Ho ho ho!

[00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:41.320]
You're standing here and having to see air and enjoy myself.

[00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:44.720]
I'm reminded of the build and invoices piled on top of my desk.

[00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:47.380]
And I'm afraid in trying to get this cruise.

[00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:49.720]
And they damn well better delivered.

[00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:51.560]
Jack Daniels.

[00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:53.180]
Oh, thank you.

[00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:54.560]
Oh, what the heck?

[00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:57.400]
Oh, here you go, young fella.

[00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:59.020]
Ho ho ho!

[00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:01.700]
You have handed me a swivel to weed.

[00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:02.920]
That's no regular weed.

[00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:04.520]
That's a dollar weed.

[00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:05.540]
Ho ho ho!

[00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:08.280]
The 560 QAMC cruise.

[00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:10.820]
Enter today to inhale that ocean spray.

[00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:11.820]
Gifts registry.

[00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:12.820]
High on sub-langure hand.

[00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:17.160]
Access from the new hundreds-old page to our sport-hold radio website will be pointed by Joyce Law.

[00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:18.800]
You might be an ignorance person.

[00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:20.000]
I can't defend it.

[00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:21.820]
Joyce Law.

[00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:22.680]
I love it.

[00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:23.640]
What a bitch.

[00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:25.880]
Anyway, it's 1018 at 560 WAMC.

[00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:27.760]
We've got 880 already on that pool.

[00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:28.840]
880.

[00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:31.300]
Boy, we'll be over 900 easy before they end the bissar.

[00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:35.220]
And that thousands like slug-nend the third bases dizzyed in with say if he were alive today

[00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:36.960]
and thank the Lord he ain't.

[00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:38.960]
Okay, somebody factored a whole bunch.

[00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:39.840]
Where do these come from?

[00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:40.740]
These are good stories.

[00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:42.740]
The magical facts machine that there's more.

[00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:44.020]
And yesterday we really had.

[00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:46.160]
I hate to say it, but we had some pretty good calls yesterday.

[00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:46.660]
Yeah, we did.

[00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:47.900]
We did.

[00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:49.600]
Some new crazy people.

[00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:50.800]
That means we're not going to get any today.

[00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:51.680]
I don't care.

[00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:52.780]
Oh, you'll see.

[00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:53.360]
There'll be a call.

[00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:54.020]
There'll be a call.

[00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:55.040]
Yeah, I mean, good ones.

[00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:55.700]
Yeah.

[00:13:56.600 --> 00:14:00.240]
Okay, I was constantly attempting to do a movie stunt landed one man in the hospital

[00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:03.200]
with burned genitals and another facing criminal charge.

[00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:04.040]
Oh, brother.

[00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:06.300]
Man, hot stuff, huh?

[00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:10.100]
The men were trying to do a stunt from one of the jackass movies in which a character

[00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:11.580]
lights his genitals on fire.

[00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:14.100]
I mean, how dumb do you have to be to be doing that?

[00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:15.220]
It's one thing to get hot.

[00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:16.260]
I think the way to do it.

[00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:16.780]
Medium dumb.

[00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:21.340]
Jared W. Anderson, 20 suffered serious burns to his hands and genitals

[00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:22.860]
according to the criminal complaint.

[00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:28.440]
Randall D. Peterson, 43, who sprayed lighter fluid on Anderson, lit him on fire.

[00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:30.600]
He went, when it got through, he was.

[00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:31.740]
BAMING!

[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.480]
Was charged with felony battery and first-degree reckless endangerment in Oaklar County

[00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:36.260]
Court on Tuesday.

[00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:41.320]
When this is told police that Anderson, who was drunk, that explains it, volunteered

[00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:43.900]
to do the stunt Sunday after watching the movie The Complain said.

[00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:45.020]
Jackass.

[00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:49.340]
According to the complaint, Anderson pulled down his pantaloonies and let pay their

[00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:50.880]
Peterson's frame with lighter fluid.

[00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:55.560]
When the fire didn't catch, when the fire didn't catch, Peterson sprayed more lighter

[00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:57.980]
fluid on Anderson, splashing some of his clothing.

[00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:03.320]
He tried again to light the fire, catching Anderson's genitals, hands, and clothing.

[00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:06.640]
Anderson ran into the bathroom, jumped to the top and put the flames out.

[00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:07.480]
He said he was.

[00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:08.760]
BAMING!

[00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:11.360]
Other, what's that?

[00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:11.940]
Fire.

[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:12.540]
No.

[00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:17.200]
Other guests took him to a Luther hospital.

[00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:20.800]
Eventually, he was treated at Regions Hospital, Bern, in the St. Paul, Minnesota for a

[00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:21.680]
second to read Burns.

[00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:22.660]
It burns!

[00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:23.920]
I'm sure that's what he was saying.

[00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:27.380]
Anderson told police that we're called to the hospital, he didn't want anybody getting

[00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:28.380]
trouble because of the stunt.

[00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:32.860]
Peterson was freed on a $2,000 signature body as a hearing schedule, late fall 16.

[00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:35.180]
If convicting, he faces up to 10 years in prison.

[00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:39.320]
I don't see why he was trying to do his buddy a favor.

[00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:41.800]
Well, there's all kinds of stuff.

[00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:42.340]
Look at that.

[00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:45.780]
What's clear is that Bill O'Reilly won't be speaking in April's tomorrow night.

[00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:50.460]
What's not clear is why, since the Naples Daily News, maybe Joyce sent this to us from

[00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:51.260]
over there on the West Coast.

[00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:56.160]
That's the story about, I had a ho-ins called Capital in Jesus' Sances.

[00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:57.100]
I can't wait to get to that.

[00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:59.080]
But this is, uh, for mildly interesting.

[00:15:59.360 --> 00:15:59.600]
Mm-hmm.

[00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:04.520]
As of six weeks ago, O'Reilly was scheduled to be the keynote speaker to fundraiser for the

[00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:07.140]
Tiger County Chapter, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.

[00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:10.860]
Well, we already know why, because he made those stupid comments about how that one

[00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:13.960]
kid was having a good time and he enjoyed being kidnapped and he was having a great time

[00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:14.880]
by a lot of the crap.

[00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:16.260]
Oh, that's what it says here.

[00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:20.200]
Then he made his infamous remarks regarding 15-year-old kidnapped victim Sean Hornback.

[00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:24.640]
On January 17th, the National Accenticated Radio and TV host, who has no numbers in this

[00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:28.280]
market, by the way, he doesn't even register a point anything on a Richter scale.

[00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:29.380]
It's like a point.

[00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:30.720]
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

[00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:32.740]
That's, uh, the great below.

[00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:36.920]
He suggested Hornback may have been complicit in his own captivity and joined the time off

[00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:38.420]
from school and in front of video game.

[00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:41.020]
And probably all enjoying all that forced sex to no doubt.

[00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:45.120]
That started a wave of protest against both O'Reilly for his lack of compassion for the

[00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:48.340]
young victim and the, uh, for, and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children

[00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:49.060]
for hosting him.

[00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:52.760]
Soon thereafter, O'Reilly was out as the speaker replaced by John Walsh.

[00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:54.580]
Well, thank God what a good swap that was.

[00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:57.480]
Was O'Reilly uninvited by the Senator?

[00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:58.680]
Did he think better of his appearance?

[00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:01.120]
Was it something else as the Naples Daily News?

[00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:05.780]
And Brett Baton writes this, I wonder if he's kind of Ross Baton or Cotton Baton?

[00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:08.960]
Then you ever hear that expression, Cotton Baton?

[00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:09.600]
Yeah.

[00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:12.160]
Oh, I thought maybe my mother just made it up.

[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.600]
But I mean, even the dinner ones that see, don't start with my mother again.

[00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:18.620]
I mean, even the dinner ones that the principals haven't seen fit to went to directly.

[00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:23.760]
On February 14th, I mailed Fox News producer Ron Mitchell says Brent, who works with O'Reilly

[00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:25.500]
asking for a few words of explanation tomorrow.

[00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:26.980]
Right, it was no longer the March 9th program.

[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.740]
He responded promptly, directed me to Fox News spokeswoman Erina Bergante.

[00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:35.340]
A call Bergante referred me to Ernie Allen, the president of NCMEC.

[00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:38.280]
That's the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.

[00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:41.180]
Allen Bergante said had letter on the subject who'd read it to me.

[00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:43.760]
Allen did not return repeated messages left in his orifice.

[00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:49.360]
The only so-called letter I could find was a short posting on the NCMEC website stating

[00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:53.360]
in response to the numerous emails we've received, we're providing the following update

[00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:57.160]
regarding the Carter County Photo Branch Fund raising dinner, Bill O'Reilly will not be

[00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:58.000]
a speaker at the dinner.

[00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:03.040]
Kathleen Corrattolo, director of the Carter County chapter of the NCMEC did not return

[00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:03.500]
my call.

[00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:07.560]
She said O'Reilly's can't contact with the organization in Beg Dock, claiming a scheduling

[00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:08.140]
conflict.

[00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:09.560]
Right, maybe so.

[00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:14.080]
But why would O'Reilly spokeswoman referring queries to the NCMEC if the decision was

[00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:15.560]
a schedule conflict on O'Reilly's end?

[00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:19.800]
And if it was, why wouldn't the NCMEC include that tidbit and it's the oldest of change of

[00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:20.160]
speakers?

[00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:25.140]
O'Reilly is a stickler for details he regularly points out the media shortcomings, especially

[00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:26.300]
when they before on his ass.

[00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:31.080]
For example, a mixell contact to me on January 30th after I ribbed O'Reilly for calling

[00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:34.800]
the Naples Daily News of paper with his conservative and editorial pages you'll find a left-wing

[00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:36.520]
cabal.

[00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:40.720]
Had I actually heard the comment, Mitchell wanted to know, had I taken O'Reilly's remarks

[00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:41.440]
out of context?

[00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:45.980]
I said I read the report of the statements to me but I paid five bucks to become a member

[00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:48.720]
of VillaWriter.com so I could listen to the archivers and for myself.

[00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:50.600]
Five bucks to become a member of that crack?

[00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:52.680]
Wow, I'll take it.

[00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:56.100]
I told him if he could come up with some other context for the statement, the Naples paper

[00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:58.280]
you mean that's a left-wing cabal down there, you know how it is.

[00:18:58.640 --> 00:18:59.700]
I'd be happy to consider it.

[00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:01.360]
He said he'd go back and listen to the tape.

[00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:04.640]
I didn't hear back from him until two weeks later when I saw an explanation for the

[00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:05.380]
change in speakers.

[00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:09.920]
Bottom line on O'Reilly presides over what he calls the Noah's Spin Zone.

[00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:13.580]
When it comes to his canceled appearance in Naples, there's enough spinning going

[00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:14.680]
on to weave a rug.

[00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:15.460]
Mo.

[00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:17.100]
Not that kind of rug.

[00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:19.320]
Oh, there's Rob Henry again.

[00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:21.300]
He was on Channel 4.

[00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:24.100]
Brandon tells me he was on Channel 4 and they booted his ass off here.

[00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:25.540]
He's been on CNN a long time.

[00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:26.440]
He looks pretty good to me.

[00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:26.840]
Hey Rob.

[00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:28.500]
Oh man, looks good.

[00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:30.380]
They got a lot of makeup on, I'm sure.

[00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:33.940]
And he's been the weather guy on CNN for quite a while and everybody got all the rumors.

[00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:34.980]
Oh Rob is gay.

[00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:35.900]
Rob is straight.

[00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:40.000]
Rob is hanging out with squirrels because he likes nuts or whatever.

[00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:42.000]
Who cares what he is?

[00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:44.480]
Is it really making any difference what anybody else is doing?

[00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:45.580]
Unless you're in on it.

[00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:46.360]
What difference is it made?

[00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:47.260]
Right.

[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:48.900]
Unless you get to watch.

[00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:50.520]
Oh, unless you're a Christian, you want to judge them.

[00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:51.440]
No, that's right.

[00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:53.360]
And then of course you think you got to get on.

[00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:55.320]
Or watch, or both.

[00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:58.200]
894 votes on a poll were varied by the bottom of the hour.

[00:19:58.300 --> 00:19:59.180]
We got 900 licked.

[00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:04.500]
Boise, Idaho, most people who call the legislative information center with the state cap are looking

[00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:07.480]
for the district's lawmakers, not advice on the afterlife.

[00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:11.800]
But that's what they get if they doubt the number for the center listed in the 2007 legislative

[00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:12.380]
directory.

[00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:16.680]
They help fill 78 page book that includes information on all 105 lawmakers in the Idaho

[00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:20.420]
House and Senate support staff, legislative procedures and the wrong number for the center.

[00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:22.960]
In a roughly 32nd message.

[00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:23.960]
About 30 men.

[00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:27.700]
Callers here after dying the bum number, a bubbly woman's voice begins, hi there.

[00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:29.920]
Today would last day of your life, would you be ready to meet God?

[00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:34.660]
If today were the last day of your life, would you be ready to meet?

[00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:35.540]
Damn God.

[00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:39.640]
She goes out of West callers to consider what Jesus Christ has done on their behalf so that

[00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:41.300]
when your last day comes, you'll be ready.

[00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:45.660]
A reverse directory shows the number which differs from the correct one by a digit belongs

[00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:47.280]
to someone named D-shirts.

[00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:49.460]
SHURTC.

[00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:50.960]
D-shirts really hurts.

[00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:53.160]
Maybe he's got the squirts.

[00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:56.140]
Messages left after Nancy machine kicked in, we're not immediately returned.

[00:20:58.360 --> 00:20:59.880]
900 votes even on the poll.

[00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:02.460]
Man, I'm going to tell you this is going to be a banner day and we get out of here at

[00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:04.360]
130 and we're really bummed out about it.

[00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:07.920]
Bring God Bless America and face decent of G-string up here.

[00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:08.460]
I'll do it.

[00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:08.880]
Oh, right.

[00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:11.880]
Americans, it's Paul Harface, standby for news.

[00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:15.460]
A wealthy couple had planned to go out for the evening.

[00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:20.320]
The woman of the house decided to give their butler G's the rest of the night off.

[00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:24.740]
She said they would be home very late and that he should just enjoy his evening.

[00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:29.740]
As it turned out, however, the wife was not having a good time at the party so she came

[00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:31.000]
home early alone.

[00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:35.460]
Her husband had to stay behind as several of his important clients were attending.

[00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:40.340]
As the woman walked into her house, she saw G-s sitting by himself in the dining room.

[00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:43.900]
She called for him to follow her and let him into the master bedroom.

[00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:48.080]
She looked at him and smiled, G-s she said, take off my dress.

[00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:49.760]
He did so.

[00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:51.400]
Carefully.

[00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:55.840]
G-s she continued to take off my stockings and guard her.

[00:21:56.980 --> 00:21:57.780]
G-s obeyed.

[00:21:57.780 --> 00:22:00.900]
G-s she said, remove my bra and panties.

[00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:02.460]
And he did this.

[00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:04.600]
The tension continued to mount.

[00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:08.580]
She then said, G-s if I ever catch you wearing my clothes again, you're fired.

[00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:09.640]
Paul Harface.

[00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:10.460]
Good day.

[00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:11.660]
Good day.

[00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:12.980]
1031 at 560.

[00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:13.660]
That's kind of cute.

[00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:16.740]
You know, not like slap your ass and fold on it around laughing, but whatever.

[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:18.680]
You don't think?

[00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:19.620]
It was cute.

[00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:20.480]
It was cute.

[00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:23.460]
How we doing on that pole, by the way, let's see.

[00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:25.420]
910, not too bad.

[00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:25.980]
910.

[00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:28.980]
Too bad it's not like 120 in the afternoon.

[00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:30.380]
It would be like 10 minutes away from.

[00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:33.680]
And you may be right.

[00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:36.880]
We may not get any calls today because we got a short show only 3.5 hours.

[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.620]
See, I just punched that up just to make sure I was working.

[00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:39.440]
What do you tell me about?

[00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:42.180]
Excuse me, getting a new internet building?

[00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:42.700]

[00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:43.840]
Well, good.

[00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:44.580]
It's about time.

[00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:46.720]
What's that going to happen?

[00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:47.780]
When they fixed line one?

[00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:48.400]
Yeah.

[00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:50.080]
17 weeks from a circus.

[00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:51.920]
The four great weeks from Tisha Bob.

[00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:57.780]
Charles Benny Neal candidate for Rockingham County Circuit Court Clerk in Harrisonburg,

[00:22:57.920 --> 00:22:58.260]
Virginia.

[00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:01.080]
One's voters to know the naked truth about his past.

[00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:04.160]
28 years ago, we posed in the buffer Playgirl Magazine.

[00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:06.500]
What kind of guys we play Girl Magazine?

[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.400]
I'm not going to run from this meal, so I'm going to run with it.

[00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:11.840]
Neal 49.

[00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:12.900]
Neal, God.

[00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:16.780]
Figured his past would be exposed anyway after his own internet search turned up a reference

[00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:19.420]
to his failed attempt to parlay the modeling job at a music career.

[00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:21.600]
So why not come forward from the start?

[00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:25.740]
Good call said James Madison University Political Science Professor Bob Roberts who predicted

[00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:28.740]
that some voters will give Neal credit for confronting the issue had on.

[00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:31.900]
His advice to Neal, take a humorous approach.

[00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:33.520]
Neal is self-employed in this man.

[00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:35.840]
I'm going to make candidates for the clerk's job, so that's his plan.

[00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:38.600]
If I can get them to smile about it, I might get their vote, he said.

[00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:45.520]
When John Cornwell graduated from Duke University last year, he landed a job that, oh, there

[00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:46.400]
it is, there's our call.

[00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:47.200]
QIM, hello.

[00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:50.180]
Yes?

[00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:52.180]
I'm sorry, I have the wrong number.

[00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:52.540]
OK.

[00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:57.120]
When John Cornwell graduated from Duke University last year, he, what?

[00:23:57.340 --> 00:23:59.220]
It's the wrong number for a friend, I'll log.

[00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:00.680]
You know, he just made a wise guy.

[00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:04.380]
He saw the STTB thing a hundred years ago, and I got the wrong number.

[00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:04.840]
OK.

[00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:08.040]
What's he trying to say is he's trying to say two things.

[00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:09.400]
One, he's got no material in two.

[00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:10.100]
I have no line.

[00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:10.580]
We know both.

[00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:13.280]
I think you're, I think I don't know what it is.

[00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:15.620]
Maybe it's because we scared him more without you and basketball.

[00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:18.660]
I know that's going to drive the audience like into hysterics.

[00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:21.440]
They're going to be shrieking and running up and down the highways yelling at every

[00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:22.700]
week, three hours early, though.

[00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:26.820]
If we, effectively made it 10, 30 instead of one through, that would really improve that

[00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:27.140]
whole deal.

[00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:28.900]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:32.360]
I mean, I got all kinds of stuff here, but we might want to take a call or two just

[00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:33.160]
to be on the safe side.

[00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:36.720]
And Palm 5, 60 in the Verizon singular wireless line.

[00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:38.320]
Your Rob Hanryhan looks pretty good there in tune.

[00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:41.400]
I think they got a lot heavy, heavy, duty pancake makeup there.

[00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:44.540]
They're photographing him from like under his chin, you know, looking straight up in

[00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:44.760]
here.

[00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:48.280]
All sorts of little tricks, tricks of the trade, is they say.

[00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:49.360]
Oh, there we go.

[00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:51.080]
There's a little smattering in it.

[00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:52.180]
WQA M, hello.

[00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:54.240]
There's a little leap down there.

[00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:56.320]
WQA M, hello.

[00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:57.500]
Come on, man.

[00:24:57.740 --> 00:24:58.160]
That's 60.

[00:24:58.540 --> 00:24:59.280]
That's going to be a lot.

[00:24:59.320 --> 00:24:59.640]
What is it?

[00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:00.940]
It's 5.60.

[00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:02.440]
This is WQA M.

[00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:03.160]
That's what I just said.

[00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:05.240]
We're 5.60 on your AM scratchy bad.

[00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:05.520]
Yes.

[00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:07.880]
How do you feel?

[00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:08.840]
I'm glad you got it.

[00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:09.580]
This is it.

[00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:11.100]
I'm on right now.

[00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:14.240]
Sounds exactly like you or your identical Simeez twin.

[00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:16.000]
This is papers.

[00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:16.960]
Yeah.

[00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:18.480]
Yeah.

[00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:19.760]
Yeah.

[00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:20.340]
Yeah.

[00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:21.360]

[00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:24.240]
WQA M, hello.

[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:25.560]
Here I am.

[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:26.540]
This here I am.

[00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:30.580]
No, it's 5.60 is what it is.

[00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:31.460]
What a bunch of bows.

[00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:33.540]
Can I talk to 5.60?

[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:34.200]
Okay.

[00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:34.980]
Here's 5.60.

[00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:35.560]
Talk to him.

[00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:35.920]
Schmuck.

[00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:37.160]
Jesus.

[00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:37.580]
God.

[00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:40.780]
You people, some of you people are so stupid that you make a box of rocks look like a bunch

[00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:41.560]
of Suda Winneleg tools.

[00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:43.020]
I mean, what the hell are we talking about?

[00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:46.480]
Here the sound of the South Florida folks.

[00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:49.100]
All you potential tourists is out there.

[00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:52.720]
We want to take your hard earned money and to visit South Florida for an ice vacation.

[00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:53.880]
Bask in the sunshine.

[00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:56.360]
We got beautiful sunshine here for Christ's Day today.

[00:25:56.940 --> 00:25:58.200]
I'm sitting here the sun is shining.

[00:25:58.340 --> 00:26:00.480]
Man, it's just a beautiful day from the inside looking out.

[00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:02.080]
And let me take a peek at that temperature.

[00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:03.240]
It's only minus seven.

[00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:05.140]
And this is the last day for the minus stuff.

[00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:06.300]
It's going to reach minus four today.

[00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:07.380]
We're talking about 1.26.

[00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:10.900]
And tomorrow it's going to be plus one and Saturday plus five.

[00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:13.480]
And Sunday, Sunday and 6th play like in the 40s again.

[00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:14.080]
Oh right.

[00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:14.640]
Oh right.

[00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:16.820]
When a doubt thought right up.

[00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:19.960]
Oh see now, now all of a sudden they want to call it.

[00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:20.620]
Now they want to play.

[00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:22.800]
Can the collars come out and play?

[00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:23.540]
And like that.

[00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:26.720]
What's this the rest of the stuff?

[00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:28.060]
Oh, and look at this Charlie B.

[00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:29.500]
Thank you Charlie B.

[00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:31.120]
Look at all the poles coming in here.

[00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:32.180]
Wow.

[00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:34.320]
Charlie B. What a maniac.

[00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:37.380]
Almost elumentic.

[00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:38.060]
They would have been insulting.

[00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:39.420]
What like I said, what a elumentic.

[00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:40.480]
Thanks Charlie.

[00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:41.580]
Are there's more?

[00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:43.300]
How many did he send?

[00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:43.860]
Like a hundred?

[00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:45.240]
Good.

[00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:47.720]
That should take us all halfway through the year.

[00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:52.600]
When John Cornwall graduated from Duke last year he landed a job as a software engineer in Atlanta.

[00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:55.860]
But soon found himself longing for his college lifestyle.

[00:26:56.420 --> 00:26:59.080]
So the engineering graduate built himself a reminder of life on campus.

[00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:02.800]
A refrigerator that can toss a can of beer to his couch with a click of remote control.

[00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:04.900]
Let me read that again.

[00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:09.000]
A refrigerator that can toss a can of beer to his couch with a click of a remote control.

[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.780]
In other words, lazy bastard.

[00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:12.660]
So I can see you.

[00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:16.500]
Right after I got out said Cornwall and I made 2006 graduate from Huntington, New York.

[00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:18.020]
I missed the college scene.

[00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:20.380]
It embodies the college spirit that didn't want to let go of.

[00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:23.140]
Oh yeah, that's like me with all of them big half gallons of mysterbrow.

[00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:27.660]
Oh, that's all I think I guess about the only thing I can remember from college is drinking lots of mysterbrows.

[00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:31.700]
Just think how much fatter you'd be if you didn't have to get up off the couch to get that mysterbrow.

[00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:35.020]
It took the 22 year old Cornwall about a hundred and a half an inch out to my room.

[00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:39.600]
It took the 22 year old Cornwall about a hundred fifty hours and four hundred bucks in parts to modify a mini fridge.

[00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:45.800]
Come at many college dorm rooms into the beer tossing contraction which could launch ten cans of beer from its magazine before needing a reload.

[00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:49.760]
It pushed the button and the constant readyed out.

[00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:51.360]
Catch it out.

[00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:56.140]
With a click of the remote fashion from a car, a key's a car's keyless entry device.

[00:27:56.540 --> 00:28:01.220]
A small elevator inside the refrigerator lets the beer can through a hole and loads in the fridge's catapult arm.

[00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:05.760]
A second click fires the device tossing the beer up to twenty feet far enough to get to the couch, you said.

[00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:08.300]
Is there a foam explosion of the can is open?

[00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:12.580]
None of the four recipients uses soft hands to cradle the can when caught.

[00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:17.900]
So just remember if you're going to handle the can, you soft hands depending on who's can you're handling, I guess.

[00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:19.720]
Especially if it's pimpley or not.

[00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:26.000]
In developing his beer catapult Cornwall said he did it a few walls and came close accidentally throwing a can through his TV set.

[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:35.360]
He since fine-tuned the machine fine-tuned the machine to land a beer where he was recently sent to home on what he called a right angle couch system.

[00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:40.460]
For now the machine throws only cans although Cornwall has thought about making a version of a barrel.

[00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:45.760]
The most beer he's run through the machine was at a party when he launched a couple of twenty four can cases.

[00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:52.520]
I did launch a lot watching the Super Bowl he said.

[00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:56.140]
My friends and I are the reason, are the reason I build it.

[00:28:56.220 --> 00:28:58.600]
I told them about the idea and hyped it so much I had to go through with it.

[00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:04.840]
A video featuring the devices that hit on the internet were more than six hundred thousand people have watched it at the Metacaffa.com

[00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:07.480]
earning Cornwall more than three thousand bucks from the website.

[00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:08.140]
I'll ride.

[00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:12.860]
Cornwall said he's talked to a brewing company about the machine but right now only one exists.

[00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:17.180]
As soon as he might start building some for sale he said, I'm keeping that option open depending on interest.

[00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:22.000]
When Cornwall was a student at Duke and elite private university in Durham were the Humper went by the way to Duke.

[00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:24.400]
Is that where they had the Foney scandal with the soccer players? Yes.

[00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:28.340]
He participated in the engineering school's robotic basketball contest,

[00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:30.700]
said mechanical engineering professor Bob Keel.

[00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:35.040]
He said students tried to build a robot that could retrieve a ping pong ball and tossed it into a small hoop.

[00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:39.180]
He always did well and the cool Keel said he came over there completely unique idea.

[00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:40.320]
He's unique.

[00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:42.780]
I've got so much time on his hand.

[00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:45.340]
And not much else.

[00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:48.700]
Let's see, Otis Moore pulls coming up and I thought maybe they were the whole thing.

[00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:49.420]
Moli, wow.

[00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:51.760]
And Charlie B also says,

[00:29:52.820 --> 00:29:53.820]
uh, a fax.

[00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:55.820]
He says,

[00:29:56.280 --> 00:30:00.320]
one of the best pieces of advice I ever heard from you was from a news item he read about a year ago.

[00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:01.320]
Thanks Charlie B.

[00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:03.440]
Oh man, do I have a good advice or what?

[00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:03.580]
Oh.

[00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:05.100]
I try.

[00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:11.320]
A medical study showed that taking about a daily teaspoon of cinnamon help prevent diabetes,

[00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:14.820]
lower cholesterol and lower blood pressure, and that for 40 days of doing this,

[00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:16.020]
the body starts to see some benefit.

[00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:17.780]
Why didn't I forget about that 40 days?

[00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:18.820]
It's a good food.

[00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:19.700]

[00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:23.120]
Yes, it's full of cinnamon and zenith.

[00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:23.460]
Mm-hmm.

[00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:24.360]
I see.

[00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:25.340]
Who did that?

[00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:26.180]
Boca.

[00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:28.360]
Really?

[00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:29.780]
That's a bit.

[00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:30.720]
That's a bit.

[00:30:31.180 --> 00:30:32.320]
I thought it was a...

[00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:34.020]
It's a good food.

[00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:38.320]
A spoon for cinnamon mix.

[00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:41.000]
A medicine for down.

[00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:44.720]
And probably not just a medicine either.

[00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:46.720]
A medical study, I just read that.

[00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:49.840]
I remember the article about the first of the year when I'm on the Corrupt Ritzen Studies findings,

[00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:52.920]
started sprinkling cinnamon in some of my food every day, the results are in.

[00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:56.560]
I'm happy to say my blood pressure which was borderline has dropped since the first of the year,

[00:30:56.820 --> 00:30:58.920]
and while I don't have diabetes knock on wood, Charlie says,

[00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:01.980]
I feel more confident that I'm doing something that will cut my risk of ever developing it.

[00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:02.760]
I do like cinnamon.

[00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:04.860]
Only problem is I like cinnamon toast,

[00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:08.320]
and the post-acrossing of blood sugar, skyrocketing can't have no bread if you've got a good food.

[00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:12.280]
And it doesn't take a trip to the doctor, doctor's prescription.

[00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:15.520]
Only a trip to the grocery store for a simple and cheap little model of spice.

[00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:18.340]
I've been eating and enjoying all my life.

[00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:19.300]
All my life.

[00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:20.080]
All of these things.

[00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:22.980]
I pass the word on to family and friends, the lack of the medical wonders of cinnamon.

[00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:24.780]
So thanks enough for bringing it to my attention,

[00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:29.400]
and I hope cinnamon is working wonders for you too, and mostly for all your audience.

[00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:30.000]
Wow.

[00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:32.100]
I'm not doing any.

[00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:33.460]
Actually, I'm going to go out today and get cinnamon.

[00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:35.460]
I'm going to eat it by the pound.

[00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:38.820]
I'm going to just take a hold, again, it's like one pound of sugar, cinnamon.

[00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:40.840]
And just hop in the tunnel.

[00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:42.060]
This is my morning and the show.

[00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:43.620]
That richer reminds me of my mother.

[00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:48.400]
If you're over 175, you could be suffering from a swollen prostate.

[00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:49.740]
Listen.

[00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:53.140]
Don't tell my mother that they want a star of my magnitude.

[00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:55.600]
They're going to have the painting to be on the air.

[00:31:56.140 --> 00:31:57.580]
Why, you're more than very negative.

[00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:00.600]
Oh.

[00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:02.600]
Oh.

[00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:04.460]
Who's with the joy?

[00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:08.240]
Oh.

[00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:09.980]
Oh.

[00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:17.080]
Oh.

[00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:17.080]

[00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:17.120]

[00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:17.120]

[00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:17.120]

[00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:18.720]
Oh.

[00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:18.820]

[00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:19.580]

[00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:19.580]

[00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:19.680]

[00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:19.680]

[00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:19.680]

[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.780]
My prostate's growing much.

[00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:25.480]
This is the serious problem for older men.

[00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:30.120]
Oh.

[00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:30.120]

[00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:30.160]
Oh.

[00:32:30.540 --> 00:32:30.540]

[00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:31.000]
Oh.

[00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:32.300]
Oh.

[00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:33.240]
Oh.

[00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:33.920]
Oh.

[00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:34.220]

[00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:34.220]

[00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:34.440]
Oh.

[00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:34.440]

[00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:34.440]

[00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:37.020]
I need to get ready.

[00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:45.860]
See, that wasn't...

[00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:48.820]
Not only was it done softly there at the very end, but it should have been...

[00:32:48.820 --> 00:32:49.800]
Don't do it or not.

[00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:51.460]
Not that.

[00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:57.920]
Well, I had to leap something out there at the very end, because clearance was all upset that it sounded like a fart sound, guys.

[00:32:58.080 --> 00:32:58.880]
We don't want to play that.

[00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:00.120]
Okay, so we didn't play it.

[00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:00.980]
Instead we played.

[00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:04.420]
Or maybe even one of these.

[00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:09.340]
Okay, let's take a look at that award winning poll right now and see how we're doing.

[00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:10.560]
But we're going to get out of here at 130.

[00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:13.100]
That sounds like a real swell-assplunded idea to me.

[00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:15.040]
A capital idea is they say in the capital.

[00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:18.460]
937 votes, boy.

[00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:20.600]
We're getting close to 1,000, not even 11 o'clock yet.

[00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:21.040]
Damn it.

[00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:22.640]
Here's the poll.

[00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:24.160]
Well, that's Charlie Beeman.

[00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:27.060]
We ought to put him on the payroll for the poll, indeed.

[00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:28.400]
I got a poll.

[00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:30.700]
We got him, let's have 50 poll ideas for me.

[00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:32.120]
Man, he sends good ones too.

[00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:37.260]
Which is, I'm not saying that anybody else sends bad ones, or that George River

[00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:40.700]
come up with a bad poll idea, that would be a very, very bad emission,

[00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:41.400]
an admission to make.

[00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:41.840]
Not good.

[00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:42.840]
But we do.

[00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:44.360]
What do you miss most about your youth?

[00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:46.860]
Sex with young people my own age, 187.

[00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:51.420]
I can honestly tell you, I never had sex with the young people my own age when I was a, you know.

[00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:56.780]
Well, I guess maybe I did, you know, just talking about a little adolescent experimentation, you know what I mean?

[00:33:58.000 --> 00:33:58.760]
I'm sure you do.

[00:33:59.460 --> 00:34:02.380]
Being irresponsible had no real consequences, 155.

[00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:05.580]
My body, 139.

[00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:06.880]
Oh, how I miss my body.

[00:34:08.700 --> 00:34:11.040]
Real music, 183.

[00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:12.800]
My hair, 68.

[00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:17.960]
In fact, that's what you're going to be saying when you're all up in heaven, this whole audience, because they listen religiously to,

[00:34:18.660 --> 00:34:20.240]
I'll be in heaven and they're going to say, what do you miss?

[00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:21.040]
Oh, my body.

[00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:22.140]
Oh, no.

[00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:24.860]
Real music, 83, my hair, 68.

[00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:26.280]
Being single, 66.

[00:34:27.180 --> 00:34:29.580]
American Americans were mostly like to broad 50.

[00:34:29.720 --> 00:34:30.700]
We were like popular, man.

[00:34:31.220 --> 00:34:32.580]
Oh, yeah, you're from a delamadica?

[00:34:32.740 --> 00:34:33.140]
Oh, yeah.

[00:34:34.420 --> 00:34:37.700]
Being ignorant, as if, for example, ignorance is bliss 40.

[00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:39.100]
I hate this poll 38.

[00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:40.540]
Real radio 28.

[00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:41.740]
Well, I sure remember those days.

[00:34:42.820 --> 00:34:45.340]
Long, long time ago, like that song goes.

[00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:48.340]
Segregation 27.

[00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:50.760]
Being in school actually learning something 25.

[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:52.080]
I never got around with that.

[00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:53.180]
There's a lot of hand-rehanigating.

[00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:54.160]
It was real pretty, man.

[00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:55.320]
It looks like a pretty guy.

[00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:58.260]
The Cold War, at least we knew who the enemy was 13,

[00:34:58.700 --> 00:35:00.740]
my stem, why would anybody miss the Cold War?

[00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:01.240]
Well, what is it?

[00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:01.760]
What does that mean?

[00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:03.540]
Is that supposed to what we got now?

[00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:04.540]
Oh, you know, they just, the dust.

[00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:05.220]
Top half of the world.

[00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:06.120]
Look what we got now.

[00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:07.000]
I guess that's what that means.

[00:35:07.740 --> 00:35:08.580]
My stem, no trouble.

[00:35:08.580 --> 00:35:10.980]
Real newspapers, seven, when people used to actually read it.

[00:35:11.060 --> 00:35:11.540]
He knows something.

[00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:13.860]
His data's crazy when it comes to their minds.

[00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:14.940]
I think that's crazy.

[00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:16.160]
You can't take this.

[00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:17.500]
I am.

[00:35:20.940 --> 00:35:21.520]
Seven, man.

[00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:22.060]
Are you lost?

[00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:23.480]
They took their minds back.

[00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:25.500]
I am in the blood.

[00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:26.260]
I am.

[00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:27.400]
It's interesting.

[00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:29.960]
Now, that was on Spike, which is a cable channel, as you know.

[00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:32.920]
And of course, the word she says there was the, was Schmidt.

[00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:34.840]
But even on the cable channel,

[00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:36.340]
it's not they bleeped out four letter words.

[00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:37.200]
Oh, that's what it was.

[00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:38.580]
No, it's not.

[00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:39.460]
I got nothing to with offended.

[00:35:39.460 --> 00:35:40.580]
I don't want to let you find it.

[00:35:40.700 --> 00:35:42.400]
No, you know, even on what's on cable.

[00:35:42.940 --> 00:35:45.760]
Would you pay for the cable for those channels to come at your home?

[00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:46.480]
You pay a premium.

[00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:48.600]
They come in over a, you know, wire.

[00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:51.900]
The FCC's got absolutely no business threatening anybody.

[00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:54.580]
The federal government, that if you say Schmidt or anything on the year,

[00:35:54.580 --> 00:35:57.120]
we're gonna like find your ass and it's gonna be a big, big deal.

[00:35:57.440 --> 00:35:59.400]
But even the cable channels are bleeping crap on them.

[00:35:59.420 --> 00:35:59.520]
No!

[00:36:00.020 --> 00:36:00.380]
Oh!

[00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:02.120]
I need to know it.

[00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:03.900]
Get me to my mom!

[00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:04.980]
Get out!

[00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:06.900]
Right now!

[00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:08.680]
I can control it, my.

[00:36:08.980 --> 00:36:11.680]
In my brother's cradle, you don't have to apologize to me.

[00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:12.340]
No, not yet.

[00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:15.120]
The later on in the movie, he did, because in my room,

[00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:17.400]
in my room, my children, where my wife sleeps,

[00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:19.000]
when my children play with their toys.

[00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:22.080]
Things like that, remember that scene?

[00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:22.680]
Oh, yeah.

[00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:23.660]
They're in the brawl of them.

[00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:24.200]
But anyway.

[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:27.220]
Hey, remember Johnny Ola?

[00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:28.200]
See, that was the thing.

[00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:28.540]
That was the thing that was the...

[00:36:28.540 --> 00:36:29.760]
I thought that was the thing.

[00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:31.320]
He had that big, it's how he didn't know it.

[00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:32.800]
He was sniffing around for a long time.

[00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:33.820]
And then as soon as he saw,

[00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:35.200]
freighted with Johnny Ola.

[00:36:35.420 --> 00:36:35.560]
Yeah.

[00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:39.200]
Anyway, Doug Thompson writes one of his really great calms,

[00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:39.900]
Capitol Hill Blue.

[00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:43.980]
He says, the verdicts came enthused in the trial former Vice President

[00:36:43.980 --> 00:36:45.720]
Schultchief of Staff, Lewis Scooter Libby,

[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:47.140]
guilty on four or five counts.

[00:36:47.140 --> 00:36:50.820]
In a perfect world, that would be enough to get Congress off its politically shy butt,

[00:36:51.180 --> 00:36:54.880]
and start impeachment proceedings against the corrupt administration of President George W. Bush.

[00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:58.040]
Four guilty verdicts against Libby is more than enough to warrant impeachment.

[00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:02.400]
The trial stripped away the clook to secrecy from most duplicated White House in modern times.

[00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:06.460]
If lying about a oral sex, see, I can't read that.

[00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:09.420]
From an intern, provides sufficient grounds for impeachment of a previous president.

[00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:11.400]
How can lying about taking the nation to war,

[00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:13.660]
subverting the Constitution outright obstruction of justice,

[00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:15.360]
not just by removing Bush and his cabal,

[00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:17.380]
from office by whatever legal means necessary?

[00:37:18.100 --> 00:37:18.940]
I guess I could have said BJ.

[00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:19.920]
Oh, don't do that.

[00:37:20.020 --> 00:37:21.440]
Then we've claimed BJ Thomas music.

[00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:26.800]
At the very least, the Libby trial revealed how Vice President Dick Cheneur orchestrated a coordinated White House effort

[00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:29.180]
to destroy the lives of former Ambassador Joe Wilson and his wife,

[00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:31.140]
covert CIA-appritive Valerie Plain.

[00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:38.320]
It showcased extraordinary lengths the administration would employ to protect its manufactured lies used to justify any legal and immoral invasion of Iraq.

[00:37:41.220 --> 00:37:44.540]
The trial esposive the White House is a venal, corrupt criminal enterprise,

[00:37:44.540 --> 00:37:49.460]
where political expediency replaced truth, and American lives would be sacrificed to protect personal agendas.

[00:37:50.420 --> 00:37:52.260]
At the center of this criminal conspiracy,

[00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:56.740]
sat Cheney and Carl Rove, Bush's brain, the political guru, were the president's ear.

[00:37:57.520 --> 00:38:01.380]
Bill Clinton, boy, Monica Lewinsky went to trial before the Senate for saying he didn't do the nasty,

[00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:05.640]
Richard Nixon did far more but as many crimes pale on significance to the corruption of the Bush administration,

[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.920]
Nixon resigned rather than face impeachment and certain convictions.

[00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:12.800]
Bush, however, remains in office continuing to drive the nation toward disaster

[00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:17.840]
while the new Democratic leadership of Congress takes impeachment off the table and says we all just have to learn to get along.

[00:38:18.580 --> 00:38:25.020]
Enough! The Libby trial documented in excruciating and exacting detail the many criminal activities of a White House out of control,

[00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:28.100]
special prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald says his job is done.

[00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:33.440]
In a single-focus world it is. He was appointed nail somebody in the CIA lead case and he did so.

[00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:38.620]
It doesn't matter that Libby is the fall guy for the bigger fish, we needed a head on a platter and Libby spits nicely.

[00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:44.740]
But the issue goes far beyond who leaked Valerie claims name to the media, it goes to the heart of a corrupt political administration that lied,

[00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:51.260]
covered and instructed to protect the use of falsified intelligence to justify a pre-planned war that is so far cost more than 3,100 American lives,

[00:38:51.620 --> 00:38:53.940]
along with thousands upon thousands of rackets of evidence.

[00:38:54.480 --> 00:39:00.500]
When the Schmidt hit the fan of release of claims name, Bush promised the American people that anyone connected with a affair would be gone from the White House.

[00:39:01.060 --> 00:39:07.180]
Time for Bush to live around that promise. He should fire Carl Rove, he should take the steps necessary to rule by President Dick Cheney from office,

[00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:09.080]
and then he should resign as President.

[00:39:11.460 --> 00:39:12.600]
Absolutely correct sir.

[00:39:12.820 --> 00:39:18.780]
In his past time to purge the White House of the Kansas that infected the body of politics, if Bush had one shred of honor, one ounce of decency,

[00:39:19.020 --> 00:39:21.840]
or even one micron of honesty he would do so. But he doesn't.

[00:39:22.380 --> 00:39:28.260]
So we're left with hoping that somebody else can step forward and take the necessary steps to remove his line, criminal ass from an office he never deserved,

[00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:29.860]
and dishonors by his very presence.

[00:39:30.620 --> 00:39:36.460]
I know the chances for such are slim, too slim given the cowardice of Congress and assistant designed to protect prox like George W. Bush.

[00:39:36.460 --> 00:39:42.180]
I can only take salvation in the fact that on some day of the distant future, Bush's time will run out and he will meet his maker.

[00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:50.420]
On that day, he'll receive the eternal damnation he deserves, because not even God will be able to forgive the many sins of the 43rd President of the United States.

[00:39:50.940 --> 00:39:54.040]
But how do you really feel, Lugy? Doug Thompson pissed off and fired up baby.

[00:39:54.860 --> 00:39:58.600]
And you know what they say in the sports segment on the station, though, if I don't find the damn thing.

[00:39:58.900 --> 00:40:01.440]
If God gets me fired up when I hear someone say that.

[00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:04.840]
Right. Another idiot. Another moron. Another one of those sports nerd morons.

[00:40:05.020 --> 00:40:12.140]
Give me the ball. Give me the ball. What the score? What the score? How's it doing? You know, like now now that tomorrow the trends come off.

[00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:15.680]
Baby, and it's going to be a real, real, real, real inventory day if you ask me whatever the hell that means.

[00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:19.860]
It's going to be much more revealing, more revealing than taking your clothes off in the middle of the town square.

[00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:24.320]
It's going to reveal some real pimples, man. And not just on the ass of progress.

[00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:30.300]
945 votes on our award-winning poll today. Who sent this one? I forget some, some, some, some, some, something.

[00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:35.760]
Yeah. Little something, something. What do you miss most about your youth? Sex with young people.

[00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:39.560]
My own age, 191. When you were young, you know, when you were young, you shouldn't want to do old people.

[00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:45.680]
Damn it. Being the irresponsible had no real consequences. 156. My body, 139.

[00:40:46.740 --> 00:40:53.180]
My music 83. My hair for 68 being single 67. American Americans were more so they liked it brought 50.

[00:40:53.900 --> 00:40:58.220]
Being ignorant as it ignores his bliss, 41. Yeah, who gives a crap about all this depressing stuff, right?

[00:40:58.220 --> 00:41:02.600]
Let's just go out and get laid and have a wonderful time. Yeah, when you're young, that's all you care about.

[00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:12.160]
Right? Oh, yeah. I hate this for all 38. 4%. Real radio 28. Not get all that many and it's because most of these people can't remember when radio was worth, you know.

[00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:20.900]
Especially AM radio. Segregation 27. Oh, being in, I wonder if that Billy Bob guy with a swastika hooded 28 times.

[00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:30.640]
27. Being in school actually very something 25, my stamina 14, the cold war, at least we knew who the enemy was 13 in real newspapers, 7 out of 949.

[00:41:31.580 --> 00:41:40.660]
So you have to miss a real newspapers that much anymore. First of all, I got the Toronto star and the Globe and Mail and the sun which is a piece of right wing propaganda and the national post which is even more right winging and garbage.

[00:41:40.660 --> 00:41:52.460]
But it was four, four daily newspapers and that's talking to you. How many you got to one for Brad one for Palm Beach, one for Narendra, one for here and one for over there and all this other crap.

[00:41:53.460 --> 00:41:59.300]
Remember when you're like 700 daily newspapers, when people, but now you don't need it because you can go online and read this stuff if you care about that stuff.

[00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:08.800]
Unless you're young, of course, what's like I said, all you want to do is maybe get stoned, get laid and go out and have a great time. Right? Right. And what's not to like about that?

[00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:09.960]
You'll watch your show.

[00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:12.140]
You'll watch your show.

[00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:13.660]
You'll watch your show.

[00:42:13.660 --> 00:42:15.500]
Any questions?

[00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:22.360]
Your president needs 20,000 or more young men and women in Iraq now.

[00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:27.200]
If you love your president, you will get your life for his friend, Corporations.

[00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:34.700]
Do your part to help secure the oil fields, permanent bases and of course the fabulous new Iraq embassy.

[00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:45.860]
By knocking on doors of Iraqi residents to win air hearts, let's fight together over insurgents who are in Iraqi residents.

[00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:51.960]
If health insurance is crossing you in army to the leg, why not really have a crossing in army to the leg?

[00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:59.120]
See a military recruiter or go directly online to Blackwater or Kaki Corporations to sign up and die today.

[00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:04.780]
Oh, let's get up there.

[00:43:04.940 --> 00:43:06.940]
Okay. I'm busy corresponding.

[00:43:07.260 --> 00:43:08.220]
Okay. No problem.

[00:43:08.340 --> 00:43:09.320]
Brandon is just out of control.

[00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:11.480]
They do some work, Brandon. Okay. Go to work and do something.

[00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:12.600]
Somebody's talking.

[00:43:13.860 --> 00:43:15.160]
111560. You want to know what I wanted to play?

[00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:15.820]
County.

[00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:25.180]
I want to be raised.

[00:43:28.020 --> 00:43:30.480]
Why don't you stay with us for the family?

[00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:33.840]
You can live here on the estate with your kids.

[00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:37.420]
You won't be deprived of anything. You can have everything you want.

[00:43:42.660 --> 00:43:47.320]
I don't know what this is. I don't know what he does. I don't know what he lives on.

[00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:53.020]
I want you to tell him that I have a question and you don't want to see him anymore.

[00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:56.140]
Just like that. No problem.

[00:43:58.840 --> 00:43:59.800]
He'll understand.

[00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:03.300]
I'm pretty sure he's dead now and quite frankly who cares.

[00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:05.880]
He had the most bizarre, like a flat nose.

[00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:08.320]
Jack Jones had a same thing. Remember the singer?

[00:44:09.340 --> 00:44:10.300]
The bandit.

[00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:11.360]
He ran into a wall.

[00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:16.280]
Somebody sliced it off for something to kind of healed up.

[00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:19.240]
They've been describing it well.

[00:44:21.340 --> 00:44:22.080]
966 on the pole.

[00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:23.340]
We're on the verge of a thousand.

[00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:24.380]
This is a half hour boy.

[00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:26.180]
The audience is going to be buzzing about that.

[00:44:26.700 --> 00:44:27.320]
WQAM. Hello.

[00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:30.360]
QAM.

[00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:34.340]
Is that something like there's somebody on there?

[00:44:34.580 --> 00:44:36.160]
No. Dead. Dead is the door.

[00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:37.480]
That was the one that was ringing too.

[00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:40.160]
I thought boy it's going to be between now and 130.

[00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:41.320]
It's only two and a half hours.

[00:44:42.340 --> 00:44:44.580]
Rather than sitting here, I've got a very impressive pile.

[00:44:44.580 --> 00:44:47.600]
In fact, I'm going to get some bandaid surgery forth.

[00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:49.680]
I told you that time about that one quack,

[00:44:49.900 --> 00:44:51.460]
Proctologist there in Tamarack.

[00:44:52.100 --> 00:44:53.720]
Try to do the old bandaid routine.

[00:44:55.140 --> 00:44:55.320]
Yeah.

[00:44:55.980 --> 00:44:57.680]
Not the bandaid, the rubber band thing.

[00:44:58.020 --> 00:45:00.000]
Remember we were playing rubber band for my hemorrhage?

[00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:00.180]
Yeah.

[00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:02.200]
That's one of the biggest scams they got going.

[00:45:02.340 --> 00:45:03.920]
They tie, oh I don't want to do it.

[00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:05.020]
No, it's not.

[00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:05.760]
They go in there.

[00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:07.500]
They take rubber bands.

[00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:07.780]
Yeah.

[00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:08.620]
Okay.

[00:45:09.340 --> 00:45:10.320]
Around your roise.

[00:45:10.420 --> 00:45:12.020]
Oh, hey, you're man.

[00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:13.280]
I didn't let him do it.

[00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:15.080]
I got a second opinion.

[00:45:15.180 --> 00:45:16.580]
He was all set to do it, man.

[00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:18.540]
That was the operation to do yours,

[00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:19.620]
of gallbladder surgery.

[00:45:20.020 --> 00:45:21.780]
Which operation is big this month, Doc?

[00:45:21.980 --> 00:45:23.480]
You know?

[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:24.720]
WDQAM, hello.

[00:45:25.060 --> 00:45:25.840]
I thought you were there.

[00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:27.340]
QAM.

[00:45:28.340 --> 00:45:28.600]
Ah!

[00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:32.140]
WDQAM, hello.

[00:45:33.180 --> 00:45:33.580]
Hello.

[00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:34.300]
Yes.

[00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:35.500]
Neil?

[00:45:36.220 --> 00:45:36.460]
Yes.

[00:45:36.920 --> 00:45:37.560]
How you doing, Neil?

[00:45:37.700 --> 00:45:41.120]
This is a guy's long time listening at first, time caller.

[00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:44.820]
I just want to let you know that I'm from the police,

[00:45:45.020 --> 00:45:47.120]
and every time I go to Miami, I hate it because everybody

[00:45:47.700 --> 00:45:49.400]
speaks to me in Spanish.

[00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:50.200]
Oh.

[00:45:50.340 --> 00:45:50.800]
It's the best entirely.

[00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:51.420]
Oh.

[00:45:52.020 --> 00:45:52.340]
Oh.

[00:45:52.340 --> 00:45:52.440]
Oh.

[00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:55.680]
My solution to you is don't go to Miami, sir.

[00:45:55.780 --> 00:45:56.460]
That's my solution.

[00:45:56.460 --> 00:45:57.280]
What the hell is he from?

[00:45:57.920 --> 00:45:58.480]
Yeah, hunger.

[00:46:01.620 --> 00:46:02.740]
2007, mark it down.

[00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:04.120]
It's the 8th of March, 2007.

[00:46:05.060 --> 00:46:07.440]
I hate when I go to Miami, everybody pick it up on me.

[00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:09.020]
Yeah, well, I don't go there, okay?

[00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:12.640]
And when we're the hell with what banana boat did he get off of for quite a while?

[00:46:12.740 --> 00:46:14.120]
He's a little bit of a...

[00:46:14.540 --> 00:46:15.840]
He had an accent.

[00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:16.720]
That's some kind of accent.

[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:18.740]
Go back where you came from, pal.

[00:46:18.780 --> 00:46:22.060]
Get one of those good old worn out rubber rafts.

[00:46:22.100 --> 00:46:23.180]
Get a good year tire.

[00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:26.560]
Get one of my perfect good year tires, man.

[00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:28.180]
Those things are indestructible at last forever.

[00:46:29.020 --> 00:46:32.180]
Just hop on the keeper's scale and just start paddling with your arms.

[00:46:32.320 --> 00:46:35.220]
Okay, just start paddling and paddling frantically and furiously.

[00:46:36.300 --> 00:46:38.460]
And go out there right behind WIOD where it used to be.

[00:46:38.460 --> 00:46:39.320]
What is there now?

[00:46:39.400 --> 00:46:40.340]
Did they ever sell that building?

[00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:42.640]
On the corner of the building?

[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:44.280]
No, the building's still there.

[00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:45.980]
I think it's storage for Channel 7 now.

[00:46:46.820 --> 00:46:47.260]
Storage?

[00:46:47.940 --> 00:46:49.640]
I think it's probably the Channel 7 closet.

[00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:52.820]
They need all that space for the Channel 7.

[00:46:52.880 --> 00:46:53.960]
I think that's the other building.

[00:46:55.020 --> 00:46:55.720]
WCAM, hello.

[00:46:57.740 --> 00:46:58.500]
QAM, hello.

[00:46:59.160 --> 00:46:59.440]
Mill.

[00:47:00.020 --> 00:47:00.180]
Yes.

[00:47:00.700 --> 00:47:03.540]
Hey, where's the guy that said wave your magic wand?

[00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:05.100]
Probably our planer.

[00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:06.500]
What's one with it?

[00:47:07.020 --> 00:47:07.660]
Andy Devine.

[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:08.400]
Yeah, shit.

[00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:09.640]
I couldn't remember his name.

[00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:10.860]
Buster Brown show, pal.

[00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:11.960]
A Buster Brown show.

[00:47:12.500 --> 00:47:12.940]
That's it.

[00:47:13.060 --> 00:47:13.600]
I got it.

[00:47:13.660 --> 00:47:13.960]
Okay.

[00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:14.600]
All right.

[00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:15.140]
You got it.

[00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:17.220]
I'll write and hopefully you'll get rid of it before the year is out.

[00:47:19.260 --> 00:47:21.660]
Yeah, this got to be saying before about the great calls we had yesterday.

[00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:23.780]
Even the ones that were infuriating and exasperating.

[00:47:23.780 --> 00:47:24.920]
At least they were like living and breathing.

[00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:27.180]
Different living and breathing, A-holes is supposed to.

[00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:29.280]
567-0560.

[00:47:30.700 --> 00:47:31.920]
Pound 560 on the horizon.

[00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:33.080]
Singular wireless line.

[00:47:33.140 --> 00:47:34.820]
There'll be a very, very quiet Thursday.

[00:47:34.820 --> 00:47:36.040]
It could be wrong.

[00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:37.240]
Are you predicted to write the answer?

[00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:38.420]
Did you know something I didn't like?

[00:47:38.500 --> 00:47:39.860]
Maybe the transmit is off or what?

[00:47:40.220 --> 00:47:42.480]
No, I just, because you were talking about it the other day.

[00:47:42.680 --> 00:47:42.880]
You see?

[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:44.760]
There's an old you into a fault.

[00:47:45.100 --> 00:47:45.100]

[00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:46.320]
And that's the day.

[00:47:46.580 --> 00:47:48.640]
And all of a sudden it's like, oh, we didn't have them to say the day.

[00:47:48.780 --> 00:47:49.260]
We love you.

[00:47:49.260 --> 00:47:49.760]
Love you, son.

[00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:51.080]
Shout out bolt yesterday.

[00:47:51.340 --> 00:47:51.900]
QA and hello.

[00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:52.320]
Bolt.

[00:47:52.700 --> 00:47:53.380]
Hello, William.

[00:47:53.840 --> 00:47:54.240]
Yes, sir.

[00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:55.800]
Yeah, Buster Brown's day.

[00:47:56.100 --> 00:47:56.880]
Canada sucks.

[00:47:57.720 --> 00:47:57.920]
Yeah.

[00:47:58.980 --> 00:47:59.340]
Good.

[00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:00.580]
My state of hell away then.

[00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:00.840]
Okay.

[00:48:00.980 --> 00:48:01.600]
Canada sucks.

[00:48:01.940 --> 00:48:03.520]
There's another bringing call from South Florida.

[00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:04.620]
Canada sucks.

[00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:05.380]
All right.

[00:48:06.940 --> 00:48:08.300]
The cream of the crop, baby.

[00:48:08.360 --> 00:48:09.160]
The intelligentsia.

[00:48:09.460 --> 00:48:12.500]
These are the, well, if you were just on serious, that guy was good.

[00:48:13.420 --> 00:48:16.380]
That guy was having like apple flex even though I wouldn't listen to his crap.

[00:48:16.820 --> 00:48:21.420]
If you were just serious and go to an XM or a series on and on a Kipper P.

[00:48:21.500 --> 00:48:22.440]
I said, it's not going to happen.

[00:48:22.680 --> 00:48:23.300]
Forget about it.

[00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:24.080]
I'm doing just fine.

[00:48:24.380 --> 00:48:25.180]
All the money's coming in.

[00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:26.040]
Everything is just great.

[00:48:26.220 --> 00:48:26.820]
Everybody's happy.

[00:48:27.100 --> 00:48:27.920]
Just come and hold on.

[00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:32.520]
If you were on serious or just screaming and ranting and ranting and raring like a lunatic.

[00:48:33.940 --> 00:48:34.680]
WDQYM Hello.

[00:48:36.420 --> 00:48:38.600]
They're coming in by the ones today, you know what I'm saying?

[00:48:39.020 --> 00:48:39.220]
Uh-huh.

[00:48:39.560 --> 00:48:40.040]
QYM.

[00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:42.540]
Buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh.

[00:48:42.740 --> 00:48:43.480]
WDQYM Hello.

[00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:45.560]
Neil.

[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:46.320]
Yes.

[00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:47.240]
Hey, sweetie.

[00:48:47.820 --> 00:48:48.080]
Yeah.

[00:48:48.440 --> 00:48:50.300]
Who the one that said peace, love and happiness.

[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:51.540]
Skip a chuck.

[00:48:53.460 --> 00:48:53.940]
Okay.

[00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:56.700]
Can you say a bell call to her little song?

[00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:01.120]
Wow.

[00:49:01.580 --> 00:49:01.980]
Woo!

[00:49:03.420 --> 00:49:04.340]
You were right, man.

[00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:06.680]
Yesterday it was like we- this day was like Nirvana.

[00:49:06.900 --> 00:49:08.120]
It's more like, uh...

[00:49:09.420 --> 00:49:09.820]
Yeah.

[00:49:10.380 --> 00:49:10.780]
Crapola.

[00:49:10.780 --> 00:49:12.000]
It's more like Anne Murray.

[00:49:12.560 --> 00:49:13.360]
Not a mind-in-ring.

[00:49:13.880 --> 00:49:14.380]
Celine Dion.

[00:49:14.580 --> 00:49:16.260]
She's the one that gives me- it's Peter Canada sucks.

[00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:18.140]
That's the only- because it's Celine Dion, I think.

[00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:20.320]
WDQYM Hello.

[00:49:21.340 --> 00:49:21.740]
Neil.

[00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:22.560]
Yes, sir.

[00:49:23.120 --> 00:49:25.480]
Is George still having the problem with the-

[00:49:25.480 --> 00:49:26.860]
uh-uh-talk coming in?

[00:49:27.540 --> 00:49:27.860]
No.

[00:49:28.460 --> 00:49:29.120]
Back off.

[00:49:29.380 --> 00:49:30.820]
We've grown to like it now.

[00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:36.020]
Neil, is George still having the problem with the issue if you're still having the problem?

[00:49:36.220 --> 00:49:37.120]
No, I'm not here right now.

[00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:38.640]
WDQYM Hello.

[00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:39.940]
Hey.

[00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:40.680]
Yeah.

[00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:44.200]
How'd I know why that uh-

[00:49:44.200 --> 00:49:47.680]
governors of South Florida are attacking the people out of their homes?

[00:49:49.260 --> 00:49:49.940]
They're doing what?

[00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:52.080]
Attacking the people out of their homes.

[00:49:52.400 --> 00:49:52.940]
Proper access.

[00:49:53.140 --> 00:49:55.080]
You got to get the governors of South Florida?

[00:49:55.080 --> 00:49:57.120]
I'll whoever it is in charge of.

[00:49:57.560 --> 00:49:57.900]
Yeah.

[00:49:58.240 --> 00:49:59.440]
The- the tax doctor, okay.

[00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:01.060]
We'll call him up and ask him.

[00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:02.220]
WDQYM Hello.

[00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:04.960]
I'm starting to get into this now.

[00:50:05.140 --> 00:50:05.720]
QYM Hello.

[00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:07.240]
Hello, Neil.

[00:50:07.500 --> 00:50:09.720]
I'm a listener from twenty-six years ago.

[00:50:10.140 --> 00:50:10.460]
Yeah.

[00:50:10.680 --> 00:50:12.140]
He sound like it.

[00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:16.200]
And uh- I just want to thank you for getting these straight-up religions.

[00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:16.980]
Thank you.

[00:50:16.980 --> 00:50:17.200]
Yeah.

[00:50:18.820 --> 00:50:19.300]
Okay.

[00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:20.560]
I'll pray for you, Schmuck.

[00:50:21.300 --> 00:50:22.820]
Forgive me straight-up religion.

[00:50:22.820 --> 00:50:23.280]
Yeah.

[00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:24.940]
He was gay on it.

[00:50:24.940 --> 00:50:25.400]
Wait for it.

[00:50:25.400 --> 00:50:26.720]
The clocky coming out there at the end.

[00:50:26.860 --> 00:50:28.380]
Sound like he had about 400 pounds of flim.

[00:50:28.540 --> 00:50:30.500]
He was ready to unload on the entire audience.

[00:50:32.060 --> 00:50:34.240]
Now, 182 votes on the poll every time I refresh it.

[00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:37.040]
They're coming in like a little chumps which it sounded like he had a few in his throat.

[00:50:37.780 --> 00:50:38.320]
His throat.

[00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:38.880]
Mm-hmm.

[00:50:39.380 --> 00:50:41.340]
Thanks for straightening me out on religion.

[00:50:41.900 --> 00:50:42.260]
Yeah.

[00:50:42.760 --> 00:50:46.880]
Sound like you could use a meal straight in our pal, although I think in your case, highly unlikely.

[00:50:47.900 --> 00:50:48.480]
WDQYM Hello.

[00:50:51.700 --> 00:50:52.280]
WDQYM Hello.

[00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:53.720]

[00:50:54.300 --> 00:50:54.440]
Yeah.

[00:50:56.860 --> 00:50:57.420]
WDQYM What is it?

[00:50:58.820 --> 00:50:59.640]
WDQYM Hello, sir.

[00:50:59.940 --> 00:51:00.820]
What do you want?

[00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:06.600]
WDQYM You asked your mama, okay, your mama.

[00:51:09.920 --> 00:51:11.580]
Speak with regard to you- well, this was just the schedule.

[00:51:11.780 --> 00:51:14.680]
I thought it was something- this yellow thank goodness isn't the next week's schedule.

[00:51:14.740 --> 00:51:15.720]
I'll see- my name is still on.

[00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:16.680]
So, I guess I'll show up.

[00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:22.000]

to conclude the thing mind

[00:51:52.460 --> 00:51:53.680]
messing about wrong fact mesh

[00:51:54.820 --> 00:51:55.300]
yeah

[00:51:56.200 --> 00:51:57.120]
I'm excited

[00:51:57.700 --> 00:51:59.940]
Well, the rest of the audience isn't, but I'm glad for you.

[00:52:00.340 --> 00:52:01.840]
Hey, there are a bunch of clutches.

[00:52:02.720 --> 00:52:03.920]
Okay, good luck to you probably.

[00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:04.340]
I only need it.

[00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:08.820]
Okay, there's a guy who found a good machine in Vegas, and he's going back this weekend to give the money back. Good.

[00:52:10.320 --> 00:52:16.360]
Well, I had a bad, I had a rough day yesterday. I started with the dollar machines, and I was doing okay for a while, and all of a sudden it went sour.

[00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:19.760]
And I tried another one that was really sour, and I tried another one that was really, really sour.

[00:52:19.960 --> 00:52:22.180]
Oh man, it was like the sour patch kids.

[00:52:22.780 --> 00:52:26.200]
And then I went to the $5 machine, and sour wouldn't even begin to describe it.

[00:52:26.220 --> 00:52:29.940]
It was just one of those days, but it's only money, and WQAM, hello.

[00:52:31.080 --> 00:52:34.260]
Okay, you played at 15, no dropper, and I love it.

[00:52:35.560 --> 00:52:36.280]
WQAM, hello.

[00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:39.320]
How are those, what are them doing? It's treating you.

[00:52:42.860 --> 00:52:43.700]
WQAM, hello.

[00:52:44.360 --> 00:52:46.700]
I caught a hammerhead shark. What should I do with it?

[00:52:48.360 --> 00:52:49.080]
WQAM, hello.

[00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:54.540]
I was going to say give it hammer, but then I probably should say give it WQAM, hello.

[00:52:55.360 --> 00:52:57.680]
Hey Neil, you're going to wish you happy anniversary.

[00:52:58.380 --> 00:52:59.660]
Okay, a little later, but that's all right.

[00:53:00.440 --> 00:53:02.300]
I hope your next one's a napkin one.

[00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:08.700]
That's all I'd say.

[00:53:08.700 --> 00:53:11.120]
Neil understand, please me.

[00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:12.300]
You want me to come?

[00:53:15.840 --> 00:53:21.920]
Come on, come on.

[00:53:23.120 --> 00:53:26.860]
If you don't listen to me, marry this man.

[00:53:28.900 --> 00:53:30.180]
Don't make me very angry.

[00:53:31.760 --> 00:53:32.880]
Good to disappoint me.

[00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:37.420]
Well, actually, disappoint. Don't think that it's a point, but when Michael gets angry then,

[00:53:37.420 --> 00:53:39.140]
yeah, his eyes start back and forth.

[00:53:39.320 --> 00:53:42.760]
Then he gets really crummy if I'm off. Don't ever ask me about my business again.

[00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:47.720]
I love the thing where she's telling me it was an abortion and it was a boy.

[00:53:49.020 --> 00:53:51.140]
He slams right across the couch.

[00:53:53.940 --> 00:53:57.360]
Slams that bitch right across the room, straight and harassed out real fast.

[00:53:59.520 --> 00:54:00.480]
988 on the pool.

[00:54:00.840 --> 00:54:03.200]
When we come back from the break, I bet we got a thousand men.

[00:54:03.260 --> 00:54:06.260]
Chris is going to be doing a kazaski up and down the hallway.

[00:54:06.260 --> 00:54:07.860]
You'll see the two team hard away.

[00:54:09.260 --> 00:54:12.020]
I hate basketball players.

[00:54:12.240 --> 00:54:14.640]
I don't like to be around basketball play.

[00:54:15.100 --> 00:54:16.580]
The biggest names.

[00:54:17.080 --> 00:54:19.460]
The best talent is the big old right away.

[00:54:19.680 --> 00:54:21.500]
They have sinewy cast muscles.

[00:54:21.840 --> 00:54:29.220]
They're sweaty from going up and down and up and down the hardwood all night long without getting tired.

[00:54:29.500 --> 00:54:35.340]
I don't want to be in the locker room with them or watch all of them in the steamy shower together playing

[00:54:35.340 --> 00:54:36.220]
and a man.

[00:54:36.680 --> 00:54:38.000]
Just thinking about it.

[00:54:38.560 --> 00:54:40.100]
I'm thinking about it right now.

[00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:43.100]
Wow!

[00:54:44.100 --> 00:54:44.940]
Never mind!

[00:54:45.880 --> 00:54:47.280]
1117-560 W. Kermits.

[00:54:47.280 --> 00:54:51.200]
Before the show today, George was telling me all kinds of stories about freaky carol, sorry receptionist,

[00:54:51.420 --> 00:54:55.500]
whose behavior just was very existence is unacceptable just on the face of it.

[00:54:55.860 --> 00:54:59.120]
But whose behavior evidently is much worse than ever anticipated or...

[00:54:59.120 --> 00:55:00.660]
That's another good reason for me not to be there.

[00:55:01.140 --> 00:55:02.160]
Hey, it's all comic relief.

[00:55:02.760 --> 00:55:03.240]
Oh, is it really?

[00:55:03.240 --> 00:55:04.220]
Yeah, if you have the stomachache.

[00:55:04.580 --> 00:55:04.900]
Oh.

[00:55:05.600 --> 00:55:10.420]
Now, this fact that you just sent me here, did I talk about this like two weeks ago about...

[00:55:10.420 --> 00:55:13.680]
...Jazelle Womchin is pregnant and allegedly by Tom Brady and then we had...

[00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:17.060]
We had that one that fax that came in or that article and that was it...

[00:55:17.060 --> 00:55:18.080]
Yeah, it was a fax.

[00:55:18.180 --> 00:55:18.640]
Yeah, but who thought?

[00:55:18.660 --> 00:55:20.640]
I always thought he was a clean cut guy, you know?

[00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:23.180]
Clean cut guys don't have sex with their girlfriends.

[00:55:23.480 --> 00:55:24.180]
Okay, just remember that.

[00:55:24.420 --> 00:55:27.160]
Clean cut guys aren't playing the old slide of the Salami routine, okay?

[00:55:27.880 --> 00:55:28.940]
So let's get serious.

[00:55:30.180 --> 00:55:30.680]
Are they?

[00:55:30.680 --> 00:55:32.180]
Oh, they are.

[00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:34.360]
What?

[00:55:34.780 --> 00:55:36.080]
I mean, what a stupid comment.

[00:55:36.180 --> 00:55:37.220]
I thought he was a clean cut guy.

[00:55:37.340 --> 00:55:40.340]
So in other words, clean cut guys aren't supposed to be having sex.

[00:55:40.520 --> 00:55:41.440]
Is that what that's supposed to mean?

[00:55:41.840 --> 00:55:42.020]
Yeah.

[00:55:42.080 --> 00:55:42.760]
Jesus, God.

[00:55:43.360 --> 00:55:46.580]
There's only one kind of guys that I know who are having sex with their girlfriends and that's...

[00:55:46.580 --> 00:55:46.700]
Yeah.

[00:55:46.820 --> 00:55:47.220]
That's right.

[00:55:48.560 --> 00:55:52.560]
A Brazilian website reported yesterday that Tom Brady's girlfriend, Jazelle Womchin, may be pregnant.

[00:55:52.600 --> 00:55:55.280]
And if so, the Patriots quarterback is the father.

[00:55:55.780 --> 00:55:57.060]
Here's something for your father.

[00:55:58.060 --> 00:56:00.240]
According to a popular celebrity website,

[00:56:01.240 --> 00:56:02.140]
what does that say?

[00:56:02.780 --> 00:56:05.000]
gmlourama.com.br.

[00:56:05.680 --> 00:56:09.940]
Womchin would be no more than two months pregnant, but may already have told select friends and family.

[00:56:10.500 --> 00:56:15.180]
The brief item was written by Joyce Pasquich, who is the Brazilian equivalent of New York Post-Richard Johnson.

[00:56:15.700 --> 00:56:16.580]
Oh, I can't say Johnson.

[00:56:17.360 --> 00:56:21.880]
Brady's agent Don Yee did not return a phone call and Womchin's representative did not have the report.

[00:56:22.200 --> 00:56:26.260]
Two weeks ago Brady's ex-girlfriend actress Bridget Moynihan, oh, this is a different one.

[00:56:26.260 --> 00:56:26.920]
Oh, I see.

[00:56:27.100 --> 00:56:27.380]
I'm confused.

[00:56:27.600 --> 00:56:28.240]
Excuse me.

[00:56:28.340 --> 00:56:32.260]
I can't keep track of all these young ladies that he's impregnating.

[00:56:32.320 --> 00:56:33.200]
Excuse me.

[00:56:33.380 --> 00:56:34.140]
Nice going, Tommy.

[00:56:34.380 --> 00:56:34.760]
He's busy.

[00:56:34.940 --> 00:56:35.120]
Okay?

[00:56:35.800 --> 00:56:36.960]
He's a busy beaver.

[00:56:37.300 --> 00:56:43.380]
Well, two weeks ago Brady's ex-girlfriend actress Bridget Moynihan revealed that she's pregnant and prayed Brady's the father.

[00:56:43.540 --> 00:56:44.640]
He wants to be like George Washington.

[00:56:44.740 --> 00:56:45.800]
He wants to be the father of our country.

[00:56:45.900 --> 00:56:46.520]
What's wrong with that?

[00:56:46.680 --> 00:56:47.240]
At a boy, Tommy.

[00:56:48.460 --> 00:56:51.520]
Moynihan's representative had no comment on the possibility of a Bunchan baby.

[00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:53.160]
Brady 29 Moynihan 30.

[00:56:53.160 --> 00:56:56.420]
He said, wouldn't you think that at this stage of his life he'd have a little more common sense?

[00:56:56.420 --> 00:56:58.960]
They'd be doing like a little bit of something, a little protection there.

[00:56:59.100 --> 00:57:01.740]
I mean, there's all these pills and devices and things, you know.

[00:57:01.900 --> 00:57:03.480]
Maybe he wants to have a Bunchan baby.

[00:57:04.460 --> 00:57:08.220]
Brady 29 Moynihan 36, dated for nearly three years before breaking up in mid-December.

[00:57:08.220 --> 00:57:12.160]
Soon after the two-time Super Bowl MVP began dating the Brazilian Supermodel,

[00:57:12.540 --> 00:57:16.560]
they pretty peer-recently enjoyed five star stays in Paris, Milano, and Al-Roma,

[00:57:16.920 --> 00:57:21.320]
and life in style with these important met Bunchan also took Brady to meet her parents and Porto Allegro, Brazil.

[00:57:21.320 --> 00:57:23.280]
Porto Allegro, excuse me, I think.

[00:57:23.460 --> 00:57:24.000]
I can't read this.

[00:57:24.520 --> 00:57:25.960]
Bunchan, who's dated, oh!

[00:57:27.180 --> 00:57:30.220]
Bunchan, who's dated Leonardo DiCaprio and surfer Kelly Slater,

[00:57:30.340 --> 00:57:34.100]
who was also dating your favorite, the least favorite, the bitch Pamela Lee,

[00:57:35.420 --> 00:57:38.580]
recently told Vanity Fair that she's like to have children, but she's no hurry.

[00:57:38.840 --> 00:57:39.120]
Surprise!

[00:57:40.500 --> 00:57:44.840]
I'd be lying if I said I didn't want a family, but my parents have been married for 35 years and have six children.

[00:57:44.920 --> 00:57:49.020]
She said, think as I'm just 26 years old, so I have plenty of time, she said.

[00:57:51.680 --> 00:57:52.700]
I'll have an empty time.

[00:57:52.900 --> 00:57:55.960]
Oh, and look at this. I guess Sean is really upset about the trolley B,

[00:57:56.220 --> 00:57:59.100]
because Sean just came out of the closet now, and here's a couple more polls.

[00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:02.740]
Thank you, Sean. You're still okay with our book.

[00:58:02.900 --> 00:58:07.140]
Okay, you don't take a backseat to anybody, although Theo Fourier was in the backseat there,

[00:58:07.240 --> 00:58:09.000]
and he forgets that he didn't know what was going on.

[00:58:09.760 --> 00:58:10.560]
He didn't feel a thing.

[00:58:11.720 --> 00:58:13.700]
Says, muzzle top on your weight for the love of Christ.

[00:58:13.840 --> 00:58:15.620]
Don't forget to begin an exercise regimen.

[00:58:15.620 --> 00:58:20.440]
Oh, and as Sean, Jesus, don't forget to begin an exercise regimen.

[00:58:20.720 --> 00:58:22.640]
Rye, you're doing a lot of leg lifts, right?

[00:58:22.840 --> 00:58:24.300]
Especially now that spring is near.

[00:58:24.380 --> 00:58:25.420]
You're lifting this, okay?

[00:58:25.880 --> 00:58:27.480]
I was doing a lot of batting at the...

[00:58:27.480 --> 00:58:29.940]
I was doing a lot of tapping at Woodbine yesterday and Gordon's Telfen.

[00:58:31.180 --> 00:58:33.120]
You're like it more than you think when you are in training.

[00:58:33.280 --> 00:58:37.040]
When you are in training, it greatly reduces the chances of...

[00:58:37.040 --> 00:58:38.220]
I mean, Sean, you must forget.

[00:58:38.440 --> 00:58:40.520]
And you ever seen me, Sean, you know who I am?

[00:58:40.980 --> 00:58:42.400]
Fat old, fat junior.

[00:58:42.560 --> 00:58:43.320]
You know who I am?

[00:58:43.840 --> 00:58:45.460]
Let me see your sideways here.

[00:58:45.580 --> 00:58:46.060]
Look at the mirror.

[00:58:46.220 --> 00:58:46.920]
Oh, geez.

[00:58:47.100 --> 00:58:49.200]
I'm picturing you in the sweats with...

[00:58:49.200 --> 00:58:50.620]
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

[00:58:50.920 --> 00:58:53.340]
When you're in training, greatly reduces the chances of depression.

[00:58:53.700 --> 00:58:54.720]
I'm not the least bit depressed.

[00:58:54.840 --> 00:58:56.260]
I'm a very, very happy person.

[00:58:56.360 --> 00:58:57.800]
You know, ankle weights might not be a bad idea.

[00:58:57.940 --> 00:58:59.000]
Yeah, I got your ankle weights.

[00:58:59.120 --> 00:59:01.280]
That's for giving the carloas, so can't keep his ass on the ground.

[00:59:03.200 --> 00:59:04.380]
Anxiety, effective jet lag.

[00:59:05.100 --> 00:59:06.720]
I've been flying to Europe so many times.

[00:59:06.820 --> 00:59:09.560]
You know, I've been traveling 100 times to Europe over the last 20 years.

[00:59:09.560 --> 00:59:10.200]
How many years are I going?

[00:59:10.300 --> 00:59:10.900]
20 years now.

[00:59:10.900 --> 00:59:12.380]
This is my 20th anniversary.

[00:59:12.380 --> 00:59:16.600]
Not only my 31st year anniversary on the year, but my 20th anniversary of my Europe

[00:59:16.600 --> 00:59:23.740]
trips to Amsterdam and Cologne and Berlin and Hamburg and Frankfurt and Stockholm and Helsinki

[00:59:23.740 --> 00:59:27.180]
and Paris and Rome and Milan and Bologna and where else am I?

[00:59:27.440 --> 00:59:28.200]
And Fadinza.

[00:59:29.320 --> 00:59:30.240]
Nothing like Europe, baby.

[00:59:30.360 --> 00:59:31.260]
Let me tell you right now.

[00:59:31.400 --> 00:59:34.400]
I'll do people out there because it's now the 8th of March.

[00:59:34.600 --> 00:59:36.440]
And you know what people are starting to get ready to plan right now?

[00:59:36.460 --> 00:59:37.940]
They're starting to plan their summer vacations.

[00:59:38.560 --> 00:59:42.240]
And fall over the house they got time off from there, working their asses off.

[00:59:43.400 --> 00:59:46.200]
Italy and all of Europe, all of Western Europe, man.

[00:59:46.360 --> 00:59:49.400]
And I know I just Western Europe, this Prague and Budapest lots of places to go.

[00:59:49.760 --> 00:59:51.180]
Lots of things, lots of people to do.

[00:59:51.320 --> 00:59:51.720]
I mean, see?

[00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:58.940]
It goes on and says, oh and also when you exercise improves Mr. Wiggly's staying power.

[01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:03.640]
You know, see, that's one thing about, I don't want to get too graphing at all of this.

[01:00:04.060 --> 01:00:07.920]
One thing about the joys of being gay is that you don't have to worry about it.

[01:00:09.220 --> 01:00:14.040]
You don't have to worry about the myth of simultaneous orgasm as in heterosexual sex,

[01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:17.120]
which of course, I guess in that case, if you got a good actress for a partner,

[01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:17.780]
it's just fine.

[01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:19.840]
You know, or a bad actress, you think, well, who cares?

[01:00:19.940 --> 01:00:20.960]
Might as well get it over with anyway.

[01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:25.460]
Just part of the joys of being gay.

[01:00:26.300 --> 01:00:29.760]
As far as straight men, technically your ladyfax is partly correct into aspect.

[01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:31.420]
Oh, you're going to hate Sean too here.

[01:00:31.620 --> 01:00:32.100]
I read it.

[01:00:32.340 --> 01:00:36.240]
He says, of course, incarceration will sometimes cause otherwise straight men to turn to other men

[01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:39.440]
in the same way a guy stuck kind of deserted island will eat all the coconuts inside.

[01:00:39.740 --> 01:00:40.780]
This doesn't make him a vegetarian.

[01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:44.520]
That's a good analogy there.

[01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:45.020]
I like that.

[01:00:46.220 --> 01:00:49.820]
Any social work will tell you, boys who are sexually abused by men often repeat the abuse

[01:00:49.820 --> 01:00:50.880]
on others of the same sex.

[01:00:51.300 --> 01:00:52.700]
This is an acting outward trauma.

[01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:54.120]
Right. That's a different thing.

[01:00:54.620 --> 01:00:55.320]
A different category.

[01:00:55.620 --> 01:00:55.700]
Right.

[01:00:56.460 --> 01:00:56.620]
Okay.

[01:00:57.080 --> 01:00:58.300]
There are a few things that I repeat.

[01:00:58.420 --> 01:00:59.740]
Can I read Sean's thing here?

[01:00:59.860 --> 01:01:02.160]
You're going to get, this is the hardest thing, man.

[01:01:02.260 --> 01:01:03.460]
You just cannot control himself.

[01:01:03.460 --> 01:01:05.700]
Bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap.

[01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:07.740]
You could sit there in a coma, the entire show.

[01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:08.700]
You were in a car.

[01:01:09.060 --> 01:01:10.400]
In a tar, in a tar few movies coma.

[01:01:10.660 --> 01:01:13.940]
That's a tar, that's a tar, can't have a rational conversation about it and you shut the other person up.

[01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:16.420]
But I'm reading you guys facts here.

[01:01:16.580 --> 01:01:17.680]
We can discuss it when we're done.

[01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:19.560]
Although I want to keep discussing this every day.

[01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:20.560]
I don't care.

[01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:20.940]
I know.

[01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:22.000]
I don't care if they're straight.

[01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:23.140]
I don't care if they're by.

[01:01:23.460 --> 01:01:24.320]
I don't care if they were gay.

[01:01:24.700 --> 01:01:26.660]
I don't care if they're 85.2 on a Richter scale.

[01:01:26.980 --> 01:01:29.740]
It is a no, well, what difference does it make what ladybug you put on somebody?

[01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:30.040]
Okay.

[01:01:30.040 --> 01:01:33.160]
If they're hot and they're ready, you know, it's like a load of it's hot and it's right.

[01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:34.240]
Let's have meaning.

[01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:37.740]
These are extremes of circumcised stance.

[01:01:37.740 --> 01:01:39.860]
And I don't think it was what George was talking about, says Sean.

[01:01:40.180 --> 01:01:45.980]
He may have been rebelling against the gay fantasy that straight guys who might strike out with the tricks at the nightclub will be lustily seeking.

[01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:48.840]
Oh, I can't read boy-ass that very night.

[01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:49.360]
That's bad.

[01:01:50.180 --> 01:01:51.380]
Well, that's what he wrote.

[01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:54.260]
Gay guys fantasize about doing a straight guy.

[01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:56.960]
The same way all straight guys fantasize about a Menager twok.

[01:01:57.060 --> 01:01:57.440]
That's right.

[01:01:58.180 --> 01:01:59.920]
And then it's just got a couple of pulls.

[01:02:01.580 --> 01:02:01.620]
Okay.

[01:02:02.100 --> 01:02:02.340]
Okay.

[01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:03.180]
Okay, Sean, just calm down.

[01:02:03.260 --> 01:02:07.300]
Just because some people don't like certain labels doesn't change the meanings of words.

[01:02:08.020 --> 01:02:09.060]
There are lots of gay guys.

[01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:10.640]
I've got these two with me whether I like labels or not.

[01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:12.620]
No, no, I'm not interested in them.

[01:02:12.660 --> 01:02:13.520]
I don't care about them.

[01:02:13.780 --> 01:02:17.040]
So see, I got confused about Giselle Bunshin and Bridget Moynihan.

[01:02:17.560 --> 01:02:19.960]
So evidently Tom Brady is knocking up everybody in sight.

[01:02:20.300 --> 01:02:22.220]
And he just, I guess that's what he wants, you know.

[01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:23.620]
What's wrong with that?

[01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:26.420]
And you can just imagine how lovely those children are going to be, you know.

[01:02:26.420 --> 01:02:28.080]
Isn't that what we should strive for in the world?

[01:02:28.620 --> 01:02:31.080]
Is that only the beautiful people reproducing all the ugly people?

[01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:34.160]
You know, lots and lots of those sterilization will be good for ought to be allowed.

[01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:36.320]
I haven't mentioned that in a very long time on the show.

[01:02:36.980 --> 01:02:40.200]
One of the great concepts that I've come up with over the years and nobody will listen to me.

[01:02:40.740 --> 01:02:42.480]
But, you know, zero population growth is fine.

[01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:45.540]
But the best way to achieve that is forced sterilization.

[01:02:45.660 --> 01:02:45.880]
Okay.

[01:02:46.940 --> 01:02:47.980]
Especially in South Florida.

[01:02:49.540 --> 01:02:52.640]
Not everybody just most like the colors.

[01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:54.900]
2013 votes on the poll.

[01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:55.440]
We're doing pretty good.

[01:02:55.480 --> 01:02:56.160]
We got over a thousand.

[01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:56.820]
You're marking that down.

[01:02:56.900 --> 01:02:58.320]
Chrissy on top of this or what, huh?

[01:02:58.640 --> 01:02:58.880]
Oh, yeah.

[01:02:59.060 --> 01:03:01.120]
And when you begin, when are you beginning your training program?

[01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:02.400]

[01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:05.240]
He's doing well.

[01:03:06.060 --> 01:03:10.200]
Don't forget to begin an exercise, regimen, especially now that spring is near.

[01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:11.540]
Well, what does that mean?

[01:03:12.380 --> 01:03:13.320]
What does that mean?

[01:03:13.420 --> 01:03:13.980]
I will say this.

[01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:15.000]
I walk more every day.

[01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:18.140]
One day here, unless it's like two days ago, when I almost never left the house.

[01:03:18.460 --> 01:03:21.280]
I walk more in one day here than like in a year down there.

[01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:22.980]
Because I don't have no car here.

[01:03:23.580 --> 01:03:26.040]
I have a fine location and I walk all over the place.

[01:03:26.420 --> 01:03:28.100]
At least a couple of miles every day.

[01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:29.860]
And that's all you're going to get for me.

[01:03:30.060 --> 01:03:32.820]
That this old dude, that's as much exercise you've been to get for me.

[01:03:33.100 --> 01:03:36.940]
I'm not going to be doing sit-ups and push-ups and wheelies and cartwheels

[01:03:36.940 --> 01:03:37.820]
and whatever else you want.

[01:03:38.780 --> 01:03:39.800]
Just think what'll happen.

[01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:42.140]
Oh, there's that debained thrombosis.

[01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:43.040]
Oh, man.

[01:03:44.260 --> 01:03:45.400]
That's from Stead Battle.

[01:03:45.640 --> 01:03:47.320]
Yeah, how come we don't hear no more about him, you know?

[01:03:47.900 --> 01:03:48.520]
Maybe because he's dead.

[01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:50.460]
I guess maybe the party's over.

[01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:52.980]
And don't forget, my greens said, call him on the party's startish.

[01:03:53.020 --> 01:03:53.920]
Oh, god, Neil.

[01:03:58.220 --> 01:03:59.120]
It's Tom Brady.

[01:03:59.340 --> 01:03:59.980]
That's what it is.

[01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:01.840]
He's the father of Andrew Cole's baby.

[01:04:01.980 --> 01:04:02.360]
I'm positive.

[01:04:03.180 --> 01:04:05.920]
Who was a little baby father and fight?

[01:04:07.020 --> 01:04:07.780]
Could be.

[01:04:08.780 --> 01:04:10.440]
One of a dozen guys.

[01:04:10.980 --> 01:04:13.440]
It may be the other hour's turn.

[01:04:14.420 --> 01:04:17.000]
Did you get brought to Stead Battle?

[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:18.080]
That's Rosen's arm.

[01:04:18.740 --> 01:04:21.140]
Very forgets as he is a dad.

[01:04:21.500 --> 01:04:23.040]
He shines up.

[01:04:23.660 --> 01:04:25.560]
Your husband has been bad.

[01:04:26.020 --> 01:04:29.340]
Looks like none of them will touch me.

[01:04:29.940 --> 01:04:33.080]
It'll be up to that crazy touch.

[01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:35.140]
Who can it be now?

[01:04:36.740 --> 01:04:38.940]
Return any cat now.

[01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:42.760]
Who is a dad now?

[01:04:48.260 --> 01:04:50.160]
Who can it be now?

[01:04:50.340 --> 01:04:50.340]

[01:04:50.340 --> 01:04:50.340]

[01:04:52.060 --> 01:04:53.880]
Love a 32 and who the hell really cares?

[01:04:53.960 --> 01:04:56.620]
Okay, if you've got even a half a brain, half a brain is better than no.

[01:04:56.720 --> 01:04:57.380]
It's not what they always say.

[01:04:57.460 --> 01:04:57.860]
Half a loaf.

[01:04:59.260 --> 01:05:00.540]
That's what my mother used to say.

[01:05:01.180 --> 01:05:01.860]
Oh no.

[01:05:04.460 --> 01:05:05.280]
It's talking about it.

[01:05:05.300 --> 01:05:06.180]
Can't believe I even said that.

[01:05:06.260 --> 01:05:07.060]
Where did that come from?

[01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:08.520]
No, that's no problem.

[01:05:09.960 --> 01:05:10.600]
Here's the facts.

[01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:15.440]
Now this person who sent this, this was coming over the facts machine as I was talking about forced sterilization.

[01:05:15.820 --> 01:05:17.180]
This has to be a psychic listener.

[01:05:17.340 --> 01:05:17.840]
Can you believe it?

[01:05:19.460 --> 01:05:21.020]
Neil, I love that Tom Brady's story.

[01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:22.880]
He should be getting about it.

[01:05:23.100 --> 01:05:25.980]
He should be getting as much as possible to help the human gene pool.

[01:05:26.780 --> 01:05:28.500]
You always talk about forced sterilization.

[01:05:28.500 --> 01:05:33.220]
Maybe it's a compromise that people that insist on having babies should be forced to use DNA from people like Tom Brady.

[01:05:33.620 --> 01:05:34.080]
Just a thought.

[01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:35.080]
There you go.

[01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:37.340]
He could just go right and pregnant every a hot looking chick.

[01:05:37.340 --> 01:05:39.600]
And I think he's already got a pretty good head start.

[01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:40.400]
If I can say that.

[01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:41.100]
Can I say that?

[01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:41.440]
No.

[01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:42.220]
Sorry, Joyce.

[01:05:42.740 --> 01:05:43.220]
Joyce Law.

[01:05:44.300 --> 01:05:46.000]
Remember Vernon Law pitched for the pirates.

[01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:46.800]
Qion, hello.

[01:05:47.780 --> 01:05:48.520]
The DK.

[01:05:48.820 --> 01:05:49.160]
Qion.

[01:05:49.420 --> 01:05:49.720]
Not there.

[01:05:49.900 --> 01:05:50.080]
Okay.

[01:05:51.060 --> 01:05:51.720]
WQion, hello.

[01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:52.400]
Is there another one?

[01:05:53.940 --> 01:05:55.180]
You notice how good that's working too?

[01:05:55.480 --> 01:05:55.860]
Qion.

[01:05:59.200 --> 01:05:59.740]
Oh, yeah.

[01:05:59.740 --> 01:05:59.740]

[01:06:00.660 --> 01:06:01.060]
Neil.

[01:06:01.580 --> 01:06:01.700]
Yes.

[01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:07.800]
Hey, would you rather listen to Joseph Gackie's show or have sex with him?

[01:06:07.820 --> 01:06:14.520]
When you let me ask you this, would you rather have a rip quarter out your neck with the sashes, tight as humanly possible, or would you rather lay to fill in with Georgia's account?

[01:06:14.660 --> 01:06:15.580]
Which one would please you more?

[01:06:17.580 --> 01:06:18.300]
WQion, hello.

[01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:20.800]
Qion.

[01:06:22.220 --> 01:06:23.180]
Hey, how you doing?

[01:06:23.580 --> 01:06:23.800]
Okay.

[01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:24.440]
How you doing?

[01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:26.540]
Got this long cough.

[01:06:26.540 --> 01:06:28.080]
But listen, three things.

[01:06:28.220 --> 01:06:29.580]
Captain America is dead.

[01:06:32.180 --> 01:06:37.740]
Next thing I'm going to say is that I smoked pot with DFO at Gulf Stream one time.

[01:06:38.100 --> 01:06:38.640]
Okay, great.

[01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:41.560]
567.0560.

[01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:43.740]
And 0.560 in the room.

[01:06:43.940 --> 01:06:48.920]
You know, you guys across the street make all the phone calls you want, but you're on something with the numbers come out tomorrow and you've got point.

[01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:49.240]
Oh.

[01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:50.220]
What are you going to say then, huh?

[01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:50.540]
Huh?

[01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:51.700]
What are you going to say then?

[01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:52.480]
Of course, maybe they won't.

[01:06:52.520 --> 01:06:53.280]
Maybe they'll kick our ass.

[01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:54.920]
Oh, they won't do it between 10 and 2.

[01:06:55.020 --> 01:06:55.640]
I guarantee you that.

[01:06:55.980 --> 01:06:57.120]
I guarantee you that.

[01:06:57.440 --> 01:06:59.700]
Siddiquid Rosencrantz Sports Steamburg.

[01:07:02.400 --> 01:07:03.460]
1025 votes on the poll.

[01:07:03.740 --> 01:07:05.120]
It's just barely 1130.

[01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:07.540]
And the good news of that is we got less than two hours to go now.

[01:07:07.640 --> 01:07:08.640]
You've got to be kidding me.

[01:07:09.800 --> 01:07:10.160]
Wow.

[01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:11.020]
Can you believe that?

[01:07:11.660 --> 01:07:12.880]
See, we get spoiled with this stuff.

[01:07:12.980 --> 01:07:14.200]
Now, what's the next Marlins again?

[01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:17.720]
Well, Wednesday next week.

[01:07:17.900 --> 01:07:17.980]
Yes.

[01:07:19.620 --> 01:07:20.220]
It is?

[01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:20.880]
Yep.

[01:07:21.380 --> 01:07:22.200]
You got the schedule there.

[01:07:22.280 --> 01:07:24.040]
We got a Marlins game next Wednesday at what time?

[01:07:24.220 --> 01:07:24.760]
At the one or what?

[01:07:24.780 --> 01:07:25.380]
You got it in here one.

[01:07:25.400 --> 01:07:26.020]
Well, for 50?

[01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:26.720]
Yeah.

[01:07:27.080 --> 01:07:27.640]
Well, for 50.

[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:29.400]
For 50, we get our next Wednesday.

[01:07:29.620 --> 01:07:30.940]
Well, that means it's an early one by Wednesday.

[01:07:31.060 --> 01:07:32.700]
Can you imagine how much I can lose next Wednesday?

[01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:35.700]
It'll make yesterday look like a walk in the park.

[01:07:36.580 --> 01:07:37.880]
Like a picnic without the ants.

[01:07:39.140 --> 01:07:40.300]
There's Rob Hanranhan again.

[01:07:40.500 --> 01:07:43.800]
And the center stage right there doing the anchoring on CNN looking real pretty, man.

[01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:44.280]
Real pretty.

[01:07:44.420 --> 01:07:45.520]
You got a real pretty mouth, baby.

[01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:47.560]
5670560.

[01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:48.960]
He did a good in deliverance, man.

[01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:50.240]
Let's refill him with him.

[01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:51.960]
Recast him as a Nade Baby character.

[01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:54.960]
He gets spanked up there up there in the woods.

[01:07:55.800 --> 01:07:56.720]
W-Q-A-M-HELLO.

[01:07:57.260 --> 01:07:59.340]
W-Q-A-M-HELLO.

[01:07:59.480 --> 01:08:02.240]
The Frektom buddy just came fed with a jock strap.

[01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:03.000]
Yeah.

[01:08:04.520 --> 01:08:05.660]
With his three super balls.

[01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:07.540]
W-Q-A-M-HELLO.

[01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:12.200]
Hey, I know for a fact that the dolphins in the 80s, they had a game full of ball players.

[01:08:13.120 --> 01:08:13.740]
No, that's good.

[01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:14.560]
I'm glad to hear about it.

[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:15.740]
I know who it is too.

[01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:17.140]
W-Q-A-M-HELLO.

[01:08:17.620 --> 01:08:18.740]
Hey, now what's happened, Bob?

[01:08:19.020 --> 01:08:19.440]
Yes, sir.

[01:08:20.300 --> 01:08:24.300]
Question with the new Cheney injury who is led to clotting off.

[01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:29.100]
You think this is Republican Party on the beginnings of the face out of Cheney putting them in the background?

[01:08:29.340 --> 01:08:30.660]
Do we only hear any more of this crazy now?

[01:08:31.060 --> 01:08:31.260]
No.

[01:08:31.860 --> 01:08:32.700]
You don't think so?

[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:33.260]
No.

[01:08:33.940 --> 01:08:38.260]
You think the Republican Party won't be smart enough to realize that he's a loose cannon and they got it.

[01:08:38.320 --> 01:08:39.220]
So let me let me say again.

[01:08:39.280 --> 01:08:45.740]
Did you ask me a question about whether I think the blood plot of the deep veins from Boses and his leg is part of a Republican plot to get Cheney out?

[01:08:45.740 --> 01:08:46.580]
And I said no.

[01:08:46.740 --> 01:08:49.100]
And you see, you don't want to ask a question or have a conversation.

[01:08:49.300 --> 01:08:52.000]
You've already made up your mind if there's a Republican conspire.

[01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:53.540]
They don't need a conspiracy, okay?

[01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:56.240]
Just the kick is ass out, went and got kick is ass out.

[01:08:56.460 --> 01:08:59.520]
And like Doug Thompson said, with Bush and the rest of the Nazis too.

[01:09:00.700 --> 01:09:01.860]
Carl Rove, my ass.

[01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:03.780]
How do you like guys like this one?

[01:09:03.860 --> 01:09:04.520]
How do you like him?

[01:09:05.020 --> 01:09:05.260]
Typical.

[01:09:05.300 --> 01:09:05.760]
Just unbelievable.

[01:09:06.100 --> 01:09:06.960]
I'm going to have to call Michael.

[01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:13.320]
This is the dialogue in this part of the movie is so like sparse.

[01:09:13.320 --> 01:09:14.220]
So let me...

[01:09:14.220 --> 01:09:14.340]
Oh!

[01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:20.420]
And I must be back to the part where Frito's wife is drunken and trying to dance and fall on a rass.

[01:09:20.420 --> 01:09:21.100]
We don't want to hear that.

[01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:25.420]
Oh, we already played that one.

[01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:26.160]
But as they're...

[01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:28.360]
I'll tell you one thing, this Godfather too sure moves slow.

[01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:29.460]
Let's go to a terminal point.

[01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:31.300]
We're getting married first.

[01:09:36.680 --> 01:09:37.360]
We're getting married.

[01:09:40.740 --> 01:09:43.580]
The income of divorce is in dry, and you're getting married.

[01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:48.720]
You see your children on weekends?

[01:09:50.020 --> 01:09:53.560]
You know your oldest boy Victor was picked up in Reno for some petty theft.

[01:09:53.780 --> 01:09:54.540]
You don't even know about him.

[01:09:54.540 --> 01:09:54.940]
Michael!

[01:09:55.180 --> 01:09:57.480]
You fly around the world with men who don't care for you.

[01:09:57.600 --> 01:09:58.480]
You're usually like a whore.

[01:09:58.660 --> 01:09:59.860]
You're not my father!

[01:09:59.940 --> 01:10:01.080]
How do you come to me for?

[01:10:01.300 --> 01:10:01.980]
I need money.

[01:10:02.680 --> 01:10:03.420]
There you go.

[01:10:04.740 --> 01:10:05.600]
10.30.

[01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:07.040]
WBZ.

[01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:07.920]
10.30 in the fall.

[01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:08.440]
103.

[01:10:09.300 --> 01:10:09.740]
WBZ.

[01:10:09.900 --> 01:10:11.260]
One of the great stations of all time, man.

[01:10:11.420 --> 01:10:16.380]
Carole the Sews and Dave Maynard and Jefferson K and Jay Dunn and Hu-Eli-Vod.

[01:10:16.740 --> 01:10:17.460]
And Bruce Bradley.

[01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:19.900]
And overnight Larry Glick.

[01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:20.900]
Larry Glick.

[01:10:21.580 --> 01:10:22.240]
W.A.M.

[01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:22.460]
Hello.

[01:10:23.620 --> 01:10:25.000]
Is this your house by 6th?

[01:10:26.260 --> 01:10:31.080]
You know if the next person says to me is this 560, does this station have call letters or what's there?

[01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:32.200]
WQAM.

[01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:33.320]
How did I answer the phone?

[01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:36.240]
I said WQAM and you said is this 560?

[01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:37.380]
I apologize.

[01:10:37.820 --> 01:10:38.020]
Oh, no.

[01:10:38.060 --> 01:10:38.320]
You should.

[01:10:38.580 --> 01:10:39.000]
You should.

[01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:39.760]
Go ahead.

[01:10:40.600 --> 01:10:42.260]
Are you going to do any more people off commercial?

[01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:44.980]
Well, what the hell was that?

[01:10:45.080 --> 01:10:46.820]
Am I going to be doing any more pizza-loved commercials?

[01:10:47.140 --> 01:10:47.480]
What was that?

[01:10:47.560 --> 01:10:48.320]
How do I know?

[01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:50.440]
I just asked you a simple question.

[01:10:50.640 --> 01:10:51.580]
I just did a show on TV.

[01:10:53.380 --> 01:10:54.700]
You missed me on TV?

[01:10:55.240 --> 01:10:56.060]
Okay, I'll send you a picture.

[01:10:56.300 --> 01:10:57.540]
Okay, I'll send you a blow-up to Alchmark.

[01:10:58.160 --> 01:10:59.100]
What an idiot.

[01:10:59.240 --> 01:10:59.640]
What a moan.

[01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:01.120]
That sounded like the guy with the eyes to me.

[01:11:01.340 --> 01:11:01.480]
Yeah.

[01:11:01.480 --> 01:11:02.300]
Was it?

[01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:03.600]
That sounded like him.

[01:11:03.720 --> 01:11:04.360]
Oh, wait a minute.

[01:11:04.520 --> 01:11:05.100]
In that case.

[01:11:07.920 --> 01:11:08.820]
Just for him.

[01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:17.840]
Hello world, there's a song that I'm singing about my Mr. Happy.

[01:11:18.220 --> 01:11:20.640]
I haven't even wore a wardrobe for a second before I do any more of those files.

[01:11:20.820 --> 01:11:23.680]
Oh, love is what I am swinging.

[01:11:24.380 --> 01:11:26.300]
It's my Mr. Happy.

[01:11:28.740 --> 01:11:31.780]
I have a dream of getting women together.

[01:11:32.440 --> 01:11:35.340]
I haven't taken a look at me with no trousers on.

[01:11:35.780 --> 01:11:38.540]
Then all the girls with me screaming together.

[01:11:39.100 --> 01:11:42.300]
And see the reason why I got the nickname of Donk.

[01:11:42.660 --> 01:11:45.520]
Hello girls, there's a thing I am hacking.

[01:11:46.380 --> 01:11:48.120]
We'll make you happy.

[01:11:50.260 --> 01:11:53.880]
Like a face fall bad, Hank Aaron would be swinging.

[01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:56.420]
It's my Mr. Happy.

[01:11:57.600 --> 01:11:59.880]
It's my Mr. Happy.

[01:12:00.940 --> 01:12:03.120]
It's my Mr. Happy.

[01:12:04.180 --> 01:12:04.560]
Huh?

[01:12:06.060 --> 01:12:06.820]
Wow.

[01:12:07.500 --> 01:12:10.500]
I bet you that's enough to get him to get off the David Kennedy blow-up dog.

[01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:20.840]
This is the moment you traded the most.

[01:12:24.200 --> 01:12:28.040]
You're on the web without any clothes.

[01:12:30.740 --> 01:12:34.580]
You lifted your shirt to show your chest.

[01:12:35.140 --> 01:12:37.760]
It did not surprise me, Chris.

[01:12:38.420 --> 01:12:41.980]
And they might take you off the shelf.

[01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:47.860]
Some new ones came out that are disgusting.

[01:12:51.480 --> 01:12:55.240]
You opened your mouth but it isn't a thing.

[01:12:58.180 --> 01:13:01.720]
You say those photos are not me.

[01:13:02.140 --> 01:13:03.500]
Now you're on your knees.

[01:13:03.900 --> 01:13:05.860]
I run in the rain.

[01:13:05.860 --> 01:13:09.060]
Baby, please keep me on the shelf.

[01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:12.120]
Because you took some new things.

[01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:13.900]
You show it some skin.

[01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:17.280]
We'll buy me into it without playing again.

[01:13:17.660 --> 01:13:19.000]
You made it my thing.

[01:13:19.540 --> 01:13:20.780]
You can't explain why.

[01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:24.440]
You thought it was a good idea to tie it.

[01:13:24.660 --> 01:13:26.000]
You took some new things.

[01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:27.620]
You gave it no one.

[01:13:28.120 --> 01:13:29.400]
One thing for sure.

[01:13:29.800 --> 01:13:31.100]
And that's very shy.

[01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:32.920]
You took some new things.

[01:13:34.180 --> 01:13:34.440]
Oh.

[01:13:34.860 --> 01:13:36.000]
You took some new things.

[01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:38.480]
16, go down to 560 WQM.

[01:13:38.580 --> 01:13:40.940]
We got the Hurricanes Warbub in 130 this afternoon.

[01:13:41.020 --> 01:13:41.700]
Any interest?

[01:13:41.820 --> 01:13:41.920]
No.

[01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:43.140]
You have a little tiny bit.

[01:13:43.140 --> 01:13:43.260]
No.

[01:13:43.400 --> 01:13:43.880]
Teeny tiny?

[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:44.140]
No.

[01:13:44.340 --> 01:13:45.360]
Oh, how about anything?

[01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:45.760]
Nothing.

[01:13:46.220 --> 01:13:46.940]
They just don't care.

[01:13:47.180 --> 01:13:48.620]
Hurricane, ingblow!

[01:13:48.820 --> 01:13:49.940]
And the experience will be on there.

[01:13:50.100 --> 01:13:51.300]
Is that added a little unsentable?

[01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:51.800]
No.

[01:13:51.940 --> 01:13:52.760]
And the Joe Zagaki?

[01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:52.980]
No.

[01:13:53.220 --> 01:13:53.380]
Oh.

[01:13:53.480 --> 01:13:55.140]
Joe Zagaki sucks, okay?

[01:13:55.260 --> 01:13:55.920]
Well, what can I say?

[01:13:56.320 --> 01:13:57.100]
You forgot the beast.

[01:13:58.100 --> 01:13:59.300]
Oh, the beast is on there too.

[01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:02.700]
Well, like I said, it sounds like a queen-thweep to me.

[01:14:02.700 --> 01:14:04.380]
Chuck Hable may be running for prison.

[01:14:04.540 --> 01:14:06.540]
He's going to make a big announcement about his future plans on Monday.

[01:14:06.680 --> 01:14:08.800]
A Republican who isn't the right wing Nazi after all.

[01:14:08.840 --> 01:14:09.600]
Wouldn't that be a something?

[01:14:10.420 --> 01:14:11.720]
They used to have a lot of them.

[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:13.320]
Yeah, well, once upon a time.

[01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:15.900]
Well, now let's see.

[01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:18.180]
Remember what we were talking before about the IOD building?

[01:14:18.180 --> 01:14:20.540]
So Brandon says, who's busy running the show today.

[01:14:20.940 --> 01:14:24.840]
If we need a choreographer with the show, I think we got somebody running it today.

[01:14:25.100 --> 01:14:29.700]
He also said, fast forward that tape a little bit because you're stuck in that one thing there with Connie and...

[01:14:29.700 --> 01:14:33.720]
Commence the promise to Risotto brothers, three territories in the Bronx after he died.

[01:14:33.840 --> 01:14:35.620]
Do you took over and you didn't give it to him?

[01:14:35.740 --> 01:14:36.600]
I love you, Wilhelm.

[01:14:36.920 --> 01:14:38.680]
Commence the promise that will go out.

[01:14:38.940 --> 01:14:39.700]
What's gonna happen?

[01:14:40.140 --> 01:14:41.180]
Commence the promise of nothing.

[01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:43.820]
He hated those other pictures more than night.

[01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:45.320]
Thank you.

[01:14:45.780 --> 01:14:46.140]
Thank you.

[01:14:46.420 --> 01:14:46.420]

[01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:47.220]
Mark.

[01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:50.660]
Are you sitting high up in the Sierra mountains?

[01:14:51.360 --> 01:14:51.900]
Are you drinking?

[01:14:52.600 --> 01:14:53.440]
Champagne cocktails.

[01:14:53.780 --> 01:14:56.720]
Anyway, since I read a story about IOD a few months ago,

[01:14:56.720 --> 01:15:00.420]
the city of North Bay Village wants that entire property and is trying to muscle Channel 7 out.

[01:15:01.240 --> 01:15:03.360]
Since last time I heard Channel 7 was fighting the state there,

[01:15:03.420 --> 01:15:07.040]
there were eyeball in the location for new studio in Broward and Channel 10 is moving to Broward too.

[01:15:07.300 --> 01:15:08.340]
Well, everybody's moving to Broward.

[01:15:08.460 --> 01:15:10.460]
Okay, not everybody, but most everybody.

[01:15:11.460 --> 01:15:13.300]
Most everybody who wants to escape from Dave County.

[01:15:13.420 --> 01:15:17.800]
Well, wouldn't that be something like an atomic bomb to just wipe that whole thing out there in North Bay Village?

[01:15:18.220 --> 01:15:21.140]
The IOD building and the Channel 7 building right side there by each?

[01:15:22.380 --> 01:15:22.780]
Wow.

[01:15:22.780 --> 01:15:23.780]
Wouldn't that be something?

[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:24.660]
And of course the tower.

[01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:27.360]
The tower I'm assuming is still sitting back there in the Bay.

[01:15:27.480 --> 01:15:29.800]
We remember they had the big deal about that last time I checked.

[01:15:30.220 --> 01:15:34.400]
And there was like a threat that we're gonna knock the damn tower down and knock the IOD off the air,

[01:15:34.420 --> 01:15:36.220]
which of course, what difference would it make at this point?

[01:15:37.460 --> 01:15:40.320]
You know, very well overlooked in that last book was there.

[01:15:40.420 --> 01:15:44.220]
Not only did we have that gigantic number in the winter book or whatever was the fall book,

[01:15:44.520 --> 01:15:47.520]
but we also kicked a living snot out of you know who?

[01:15:47.520 --> 01:15:48.680]
Self-popping rush.

[01:15:48.840 --> 01:15:52.420]
I mean, we always beat him just about always, but we just kicked the crap out of him.

[01:15:53.420 --> 01:15:53.860]
Remember that?

[01:15:54.080 --> 01:15:54.240]
Yeah.

[01:15:54.720 --> 01:15:55.680]
I just mentioned that in passing.

[01:15:55.800 --> 01:15:57.820]
Just to pat myself on the shoulder a little bit.

[01:15:57.960 --> 01:15:59.100]
We won't bend it back to about always.

[01:15:59.580 --> 01:16:01.440]
I don't want to start my training program that early.

[01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:05.360]
I wait till they put one leg in the grave before I start my train.

[01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:07.140]
That line, I gotta read it again.

[01:16:07.260 --> 01:16:08.500]
What I do with Sean's pulls is it.

[01:16:09.680 --> 01:16:10.580]
It was a great line.

[01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:12.280]
I know it's in the middle of my pool pile.

[01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:12.880]
I've got so many.

[01:16:13.120 --> 01:16:14.080]
I've got him piled up the ceiling.

[01:16:14.200 --> 01:16:14.920]
Thanks to Charlie B.

[01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:15.620]
How you be, Charlie?

[01:16:15.620 --> 01:16:20.660]
It says, don't forget to begin an exercise regimen for the love of Christ.

[01:16:21.080 --> 01:16:21.940]
Well, I don't love Christ.

[01:16:22.100 --> 01:16:22.700]
How do you like that?

[01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:24.040]
Ready those other geckies?

[01:16:24.860 --> 01:16:27.460]
Especially now that it's spring is near, you're like it more than you think.

[01:16:27.540 --> 01:16:31.520]
When you're in training, it greatly reduces the chances of depression, anxiety,

[01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:35.080]
effects of jet lag, attitude, and improves Mr. Wiggly's staying power.

[01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:36.140]
Well, I got news for you.

[01:16:36.180 --> 01:16:37.140]
I mean, how about Piggly Wiggly?

[01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:39.020]
I ain't got nothing Wiggly believe me at my age.

[01:16:39.140 --> 01:16:40.700]
Even before my age, you're got nothing Wiggly.

[01:16:42.680 --> 01:16:43.760]
1445 votes on the poll.

[01:16:44.100 --> 01:16:46.120]
Wired Irrackyman, trigger a scared LA airport.

[01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:47.460]
You're going to love this story.

[01:16:48.540 --> 01:16:49.080]
Can't wait.

[01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:51.260]
You are just going to be amazed at this story.

[01:16:52.140 --> 01:16:56.600]
An Irracky National wearing wires and conceiving a magnet inside his rectum,

[01:16:56.960 --> 01:16:58.240]
a frigate security scare.

[01:16:59.480 --> 01:17:00.640]
I'm wires wrong with you.

[01:17:00.860 --> 01:17:01.820]
I'm just telling you right now.

[01:17:03.480 --> 01:17:06.200]
Can I have to start over again?

[01:17:06.980 --> 01:17:10.680]
An Irracky National wearing wires and conceiving a magnet inside his rectum.

[01:17:12.040 --> 01:17:13.380]
Trigger a security scare.

[01:17:13.580 --> 01:17:16.180]
LA airport on Tuesday, but official study post-alparin thread.

[01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:17.820]
That's what they think.

[01:17:18.260 --> 01:17:23.920]
The man identified by law enforcement officials that five hell amolecci 35,

[01:17:24.580 --> 01:17:28.020]
set off in the alarm during a passenger's training airport early on Tuesday morning.

[01:17:31.660 --> 01:17:32.960]
They're trying to control him.

[01:17:33.560 --> 01:17:36.300]
The study was harmless, but there was a guy with a metal platenist.

[01:17:36.540 --> 01:17:40.320]
A police bomb squad was called to examine all his deemed a suspicious item.

[01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:43.120]
He was found during a body cavity search of the man.

[01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:44.540]
What's this in your rectum?

[01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:46.480]
Oh my God, there's wires coming out of there.

[01:17:47.180 --> 01:17:47.980]
A magnet.

[01:17:48.200 --> 01:17:48.460]
A magnet.

[01:17:50.140 --> 01:17:52.920]
Local media reports that a magnet was found in his rectum.

[01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:54.040]
That's what it says here.

[01:17:54.260 --> 01:17:55.060]
This is from our Reuters.

[01:17:55.300 --> 01:17:55.760]
Oh my God.

[01:17:55.860 --> 01:17:56.460]
Must be the MS.

[01:17:58.060 --> 01:17:58.320]
He was secreting...

[01:17:59.040 --> 01:17:59.540]
Oh, I'm sorry.

[01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:01.480]
I was almost going to say secreting.

[01:18:01.580 --> 01:18:02.180]
That would not be good.

[01:18:02.920 --> 01:18:04.000]
Oh, that would not be good.

[01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:06.440]
It was probably secreting something.

[01:18:07.260 --> 01:18:09.360]
He was secreting these items in a body cavity.

[01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:15.320]
That was a great concern because there were also some electric wires associated with the body cavity.

[01:18:15.840 --> 01:18:16.920]
They were associated with it.

[01:18:17.200 --> 01:18:19.180]
Larry Federer, secreting director for the T.S.A.

[01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:20.260]
and the airport told Reuters.

[01:18:21.380 --> 01:18:26.140]
Maliki 35, who lives in Atlantic City, was preparing to board a US Airways flight from LA to Philadelphia.

[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:28.880]
The flight left without him, but with his luggage aboard.

[01:18:29.320 --> 01:18:30.360]
He made an old hat, and that's smart.

[01:18:30.980 --> 01:18:31.740]
Here's a guy that's got...

[01:18:31.740 --> 01:18:35.540]
He's got a magnet and wires in his ass, and they kicked him off the flight,

[01:18:35.620 --> 01:18:36.900]
but they left his luggage on the plane.

[01:18:38.360 --> 01:18:42.440]
Oh, he made an unskidz landing in Vegas where the plane was thoroughly searched, nothing was found.

[01:18:43.120 --> 01:18:46.440]
Passengers were not evacuated if we can say that, and no flights were disrupted by the incident,

[01:18:46.620 --> 01:18:47.540]
and Trimital 1 and LAX.

[01:18:47.820 --> 01:18:49.120]
There was never a threat, Federer said.

[01:18:49.420 --> 01:18:52.080]
He said police and FBI were called an abundance of caution.

[01:18:52.620 --> 01:18:53.160]
What a minute.

[01:18:54.240 --> 01:18:57.960]
A suspicious item was found during a body cavity search of the man.

[01:18:58.540 --> 01:19:02.160]
I thought you were going to get to the point in the story where the guy explains what this device was,

[01:19:02.460 --> 01:19:04.800]
what its function is, why you would have a magnet up your ass.

[01:19:05.160 --> 01:19:06.100]
That's the end of the story.

[01:19:06.100 --> 01:19:06.860]
Oh, no.

[01:19:07.040 --> 01:19:07.700]
I need closure.

[01:19:09.280 --> 01:19:10.020]
Closure, yeah.

[01:19:10.360 --> 01:19:10.640]
Yeah.

[01:19:11.220 --> 01:19:12.300]
I mean, that's a magnetic bracelet.

[01:19:12.300 --> 01:19:13.160]
So I got...

[01:19:13.160 --> 01:19:14.060]
I like Tom Enza.

[01:19:14.180 --> 01:19:15.100]
Who gots?

[01:19:15.800 --> 01:19:16.760]
He thinks it's Sherpa.

[01:19:17.300 --> 01:19:18.740]
Sherpa, he says he's a cockkin.

[01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:21.640]
And you're best in judgment on how I run my thing.

[01:19:23.160 --> 01:19:23.780]
For a media.

[01:19:24.940 --> 01:19:26.920]
I'm going to put it on over there quite a bit far away.

[01:19:27.840 --> 01:19:28.420]
Farletta, you know.

[01:19:28.440 --> 01:19:30.700]
For some pretty dirty, dirty, cozy, deep meat.

[01:19:31.360 --> 01:19:32.420]
I'm going to eat in here.

[01:19:32.540 --> 01:19:33.300]
No man's a car.

[01:19:33.680 --> 01:19:34.780]
No man's a Las Vegas.

[01:19:35.320 --> 01:19:36.940]
And a man's a Miami.

[01:19:37.080 --> 01:19:38.080]
No man's a Miami.

[01:19:38.280 --> 01:19:39.500]
Baby, I'm going to start with this.

[01:19:39.500 --> 01:19:40.560]
No man's a Miami.

[01:19:41.020 --> 01:19:41.560]
Man's a Las Vegas.

[01:19:43.420 --> 01:19:44.100]
1048 votes.

[01:19:44.100 --> 01:19:45.440]
Let's take another look at this poll.

[01:19:46.200 --> 01:19:46.880]
It's okay.

[01:19:47.460 --> 01:19:48.640]
Not one of my all time favorites.

[01:19:49.400 --> 01:19:50.800]
What do you miss most about your youth?

[01:19:51.600 --> 01:19:52.520]
I would say having it.

[01:19:53.520 --> 01:19:54.100]
Being it.

[01:19:54.400 --> 01:19:57.920]
Being living and breathing, especially being an old fossil that I am.

[01:19:58.460 --> 01:20:00.500]
Sex with young people my own age, 203.

[01:20:00.860 --> 01:20:02.320]
Everything always comes back to sex.

[01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:05.400]
And there's a lot of hand-rehand on my TV again looking really fine as wine.

[01:20:05.680 --> 01:20:06.760]
Actually, this looks pretty good.

[01:20:07.360 --> 01:20:07.720]
I'm sorry.

[01:20:08.240 --> 01:20:09.320]
See it all comes back to sex.

[01:20:09.580 --> 01:20:10.260]
Airbeam time.

[01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:11.500]
Sex, sex, sex.

[01:20:11.660 --> 01:20:12.520]
That's all it comes back to.

[01:20:12.620 --> 01:20:13.000]
And why not?

[01:20:13.540 --> 01:20:14.180]
What else is there?

[01:20:15.180 --> 01:20:17.320]
Being irresponsible with no real consequences, 176.

[01:20:18.180 --> 01:20:19.420]
My body, 158.

[01:20:19.580 --> 01:20:20.780]
And what if that has something to do with sex?

[01:20:22.220 --> 01:20:23.500]
Real music, 95.

[01:20:23.740 --> 01:20:24.600]
Being single, 74.

[01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:25.880]
My hair is 74.

[01:20:26.460 --> 01:20:27.140]
I don't miss mine.

[01:20:27.220 --> 01:20:29.380]
I just keep chopping off of the like I have.

[01:20:29.380 --> 01:20:33.540]
American Americans who are mostly loved abroad liked it at 57.

[01:20:33.800 --> 01:20:36.300]
Being ignorant as in ignorance is bliss 42.

[01:20:37.240 --> 01:20:40.820]
I think being oblivious would be a better word than being ignorant.

[01:20:41.120 --> 01:20:42.700]
But they explained it.

[01:20:42.820 --> 01:20:44.560]
That's what they're trying to say, right? Oblivious.

[01:20:45.500 --> 01:20:48.080]
I hate this pull 40, only 3.8%.

[01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:48.760]
They likes it.

[01:20:49.240 --> 01:20:50.380]
Real radio 31.

[01:20:51.160 --> 01:20:51.600]
Segregation.

[01:20:51.820 --> 01:20:52.560]
We got the...

[01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:53.440]
But third man.

[01:20:53.560 --> 01:20:54.480]
He racist out there.

[01:20:55.380 --> 01:20:57.900]
I'm sure we got a lot more than that, but they just had other things to vote for.

[01:20:58.560 --> 01:21:02.420]
Being in school and actually learning something 29, well from the sounds of the cars,

[01:21:02.660 --> 01:21:04.800]
there aren't too many who missed it because they never did that.

[01:21:05.120 --> 01:21:05.460]
I never did.

[01:21:05.740 --> 01:21:06.280]
What did we learn?

[01:21:06.840 --> 01:21:08.740]
We learned algebra and all kinds of...

[01:21:08.740 --> 01:21:10.860]
What was the point of all of that?

[01:21:11.220 --> 01:21:14.400]
And that thing we're talking about the other day about the presidents in the chronological order.

[01:21:14.680 --> 01:21:15.340]
Who cares?

[01:21:15.760 --> 01:21:17.340]
What is that going to do for my life?

[01:21:17.500 --> 01:21:17.800]
Nothing.

[01:21:18.280 --> 01:21:19.020]
What is that going to do?

[01:21:19.180 --> 01:21:26.080]
Madison and Monroe and John Quincy Adams and Andy Jackson and Martin Van Buren and William Henry Harrison.

[01:21:26.080 --> 01:21:27.620]
It was too stupid to come out of the cold.

[01:21:28.360 --> 01:21:29.220]
Anyway, John Tyler.

[01:21:29.500 --> 01:21:31.180]
Tippy-toe and Tippy-toe.

[01:21:31.180 --> 01:21:32.440]
Tippy-toe and Tyler too.

[01:21:33.620 --> 01:21:35.080]
Boy do I know some crap or what?

[01:21:35.420 --> 01:21:36.080]
That's the problem.

[01:21:36.140 --> 01:21:36.580]
It's all crap.

[01:21:37.160 --> 01:21:38.140]
My stamina 20.

[01:21:38.700 --> 01:21:40.680]
The cold war, at least we knew who the enemy was, 14.

[01:21:40.840 --> 01:21:41.380]
The Ruskies.

[01:21:41.620 --> 01:21:43.660]
Comedy-step, comedy-step, comedy-step, baby.

[01:21:44.560 --> 01:21:46.380]
That's when your people were really in their glory.

[01:21:47.060 --> 01:21:47.280]
Holes.

[01:21:47.540 --> 01:21:47.780]
Glory?

[01:21:48.540 --> 01:21:48.760]
Glory.

[01:21:49.120 --> 01:21:50.880]
And real newspapers, it started at 7.

[01:21:50.940 --> 01:21:52.160]
It's still 7.550.

[01:21:53.700 --> 01:21:57.180]
WMGM New York, 1050, WHN, CHUM Toronto.

[01:21:57.760 --> 01:21:59.100]
Don't forget they'll Canada sucks.

[01:21:59.320 --> 01:22:00.160]
Remember that great call we had today?

[01:22:00.300 --> 01:22:01.920]
We had some really special goals today.

[01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:03.640]
They've all been really special.

[01:22:03.760 --> 01:22:04.940]
Come on, let's get them going again, man.

[01:22:05.120 --> 01:22:06.380]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[01:22:08.360 --> 01:22:11.920]
I mean, we got to get out of here at 130 and make way for that big hurricane basketball gamer.

[01:22:12.180 --> 01:22:13.940]
Right in the middle of the daytime when people are awake.

[01:22:14.100 --> 01:22:17.700]
When living and breathing people wants to entertain them in a few, a few yuck, a couple of chuckles.

[01:22:18.020 --> 01:22:19.320]
Maybe once in a while one of these.

[01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:21.540]
You're not going to get that.

[01:22:21.700 --> 01:22:22.140]
I'll take you to the next one.

[01:22:31.980 --> 01:22:33.060]

[01:22:36.080 --> 01:22:37.560]
I'll take you to the next one.

[01:22:37.700 --> 01:22:37.700]

[01:22:37.700 --> 01:22:38.460]
I'll take you to the next one.

[01:22:38.500 --> 01:22:38.500]

[01:22:38.560 --> 01:22:38.900]
I'll take you to the next one.

[01:22:38.980 --> 01:22:40.100]
I'll take you to the next one.

[01:22:40.240 --> 01:22:40.620]
I'll take you to the next one.

[01:22:41.680 --> 01:22:42.340]
I'll take you to the next one.

[01:22:42.660 --> 01:22:43.240]
I'll take you to the next one.

[01:22:46.080 --> 01:22:46.920]
I'll take you to the next one.

[01:22:47.020 --> 01:22:49.080]
I'll take you to the next one.

[01:22:49.260 --> 01:22:50.580]
I'll take you to the next one.

[01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:51.400]
I'll take you to the next one.

[01:22:51.400 --> 01:22:52.020]
I'll take you to the next one.

[01:22:53.120 --> 01:22:54.560]
Kenny and Bob must go.

[01:22:54.820 --> 01:22:56.100]
Kenny and Bob must go.

[01:22:56.440 --> 01:22:56.620]
Kenny and Bob must go.

[01:22:56.620 --> 01:22:57.600]
Yeah, I'm Kenny and Bob must go.

[01:22:57.620 --> 01:22:58.900]

[01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:01.780]

[01:23:43.700 --> 01:23:51.980]
I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean

[01:24:09.940 --> 01:24:21.960]
I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean

[01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:45.780]
we're not talking, we're talking, but we're talking. We're talking. You're talking. You're talking. And you're saying, what's that when the

[01:24:47.180 --> 01:24:51.140]
club president's president's presidential revenir? You know, we're talking about something

[01:24:51.140 --> 01:24:51.700]
when the system andtings all right this are in the left side, and so we're talking about why the

[01:24:55.820 --> 01:24:58.920]
Wow, is that really the track from the song?

[01:24:59.640 --> 01:25:03.680]
Because usually they use the music track from the end of the song, huh?

[01:25:05.480 --> 01:25:07.440]
That's even more sour than the Star Packs kids.

[01:25:08.940 --> 01:25:15.040]
162 votes on the pool today and we'll have to make 1100 before 130 this afternoon and then they will fear us.

[01:25:15.200 --> 01:25:18.640]
Morgan is the 12 to 1 hour on Q8M!

[01:25:26.080 --> 01:25:29.820]
This was the moment you dreaded the most!

[01:25:32.680 --> 01:25:36.680]
A miracle voted in guess what you lost!

[01:25:39.960 --> 01:25:46.420]
Secret told you you can no longer stay, and call I had nothing nice to say.

[01:25:46.420 --> 01:25:50.960]
And then they put your montage on!

[01:25:51.100 --> 01:25:57.040]
Your musical career has run aground!

[01:26:00.020 --> 01:26:03.780]
And you've been neutered by the dog pound!

[01:26:04.640 --> 01:26:05.340]
That's a movie!

[01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:10.400]
You gotta sing along before you go away!

[01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:17.780]
The same one no one liked yesterday, and is the reason that you got!

[01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:26.020]
Because you sang a bad song, you wore a bad shirt, so I didn't tell you where it kept going and that it hurts!

[01:26:26.460 --> 01:26:32.880]
You say you'll be fine, you still beat a star, but I'm up from now, you'll be parking cars!

[01:26:32.880 --> 01:26:41.740]
You sang a bad song, you know you're just dancing, you're 15 minutes, you're standing still re, you sang a bad song!

[01:26:42.540 --> 01:26:45.040]
You fell, you sang a bad song!

[01:26:45.400 --> 01:26:48.680]
Come about 20560 WQA and man we are well long long singing this song!

[01:26:48.760 --> 01:26:55.220]
My blood sugar is so good the last couple of days, that's why I sound like I'm full of vinegar and whatever goes on top of it, underneath it and over it, etc.

[01:26:55.860 --> 01:26:56.000]
Oil!

[01:26:57.740 --> 01:27:05.860]
That's right, the oily bird, oh you know something I think I'm old enough now, ready for the oily bird, maybe I'll come back to Florida and enjoy the oily bird and sit around with all those old cockers in the world!

[01:27:06.480 --> 01:27:09.880]
Talking about whatever cold soup.

[01:27:10.260 --> 01:27:18.140]
So anyway your buddy, you have a new buddy here on our MySpace Chris, who I thought was my buddy and I've been communicating with him here for a few days for about a week now, but he's your buddy on his...

[01:27:18.140 --> 01:27:21.780]
He's more adamant than you are, he's by...

[01:27:21.780 --> 01:27:28.540]
And I don't understand why he's so adamant, he says words do have meaning and George is right, I think he wants you man!

[01:27:29.500 --> 01:27:34.180]
Give me 60 seconds to explain myself, you wouldn't want me to respond to your crazy fan!

[01:27:34.900 --> 01:27:43.860]
Go ahead, go ahead, wait a minute, let me say this to you, take all the time, I want to have to go until that horrible basketball game, take all the time that you want!

[01:27:45.580 --> 01:27:55.480]
Go ahead, I'm just a kosher person, a someone who doesn't eat trade, a vegetarian is someone who doesn't eat meat, a homosexual is someone who is attracted to members of the same sex,

[01:27:55.720 --> 01:28:03.940]
a bisexual is attracted to members of both sex, and they might have a preference, and a heterosexual is someone who is attracted exclusively to members of the opposite sex.

[01:28:03.940 --> 01:28:09.660]
If you identify yourself as a straight person for whatever reason, social stigma, what do we know exists?

[01:28:10.260 --> 01:28:16.340]
Go ahead, I'm gonna say how we're this boring, how we're this boring, you don't keep rehashing this!

[01:28:16.600 --> 01:28:20.800]
No over and over and over, you just brought it up, I didn't, and you didn't let me respond to your crazy fan!

[01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:50.760]
I'm talking to a man, I'm talking to a man, I'm talking to a man, I'm talking to a man, I'm talking to a man, I'm talking to a man, I'm talking to a man, I'm talking to a man, I'm talking to a man, I'm talking to a man, I'm talking to a man, I'm talking to a man, I'm talking to a man, I'm talking to a man, I'm talking to a man, I'm talking to a man, I'm talking to a man, I'm talking to a man, I'm talking to a man, I'm talking to a man, I'm talking to a man, I'm talking to a man, I'm talking to a man, I'm talking to a man, I'm talking to a man, I'm talking to a man, I'm talking to a man, I'm talking to a man, I'm talking to a man, I'm talking to a man, I'm talking to a man, I'm talking to

[01:29:31.780 --> 01:29:41.220]
a man, I'm talking to a man, I'm taking a break to bring a trainer to see us Smuk with us.

[01:29:41.220 --> 01:29:44.260]

[01:29:44.680 --> 01:29:45.580]

[01:30:12.040 --> 01:30:14.500]
and confident enough that i'll understand it

[01:30:14.500 --> 01:30:17.120]
he said hope you would ask a lot of money that would

[01:30:17.120 --> 01:30:17.740]
you know what i'm going to do

[01:30:17.740 --> 01:30:21.600]
so he says when you're going to go back to get some of our money back

[01:30:21.600 --> 01:30:23.460]
that's great that's cute

[01:30:23.460 --> 01:30:25.920]
nice go on christia cute and more ways than one but anyway

[01:30:26.560 --> 01:30:28.580]
there he is another is another superstar

[01:30:28.580 --> 01:30:31.460]
everybody wants to be a star in a show you know we got steven and we got

[01:30:31.460 --> 01:30:35.160]
the brand and we got christ and we got this one and that one and whatever we

[01:30:35.160 --> 01:30:37.780]
got you know even that gay psychologist that you're reading

[01:30:37.780 --> 01:30:39.140]
a lot of

[01:30:39.140 --> 01:30:44.800]
he said a lot of straight identified guys come to me and say this and that

[01:30:44.800 --> 01:30:47.980]
that's exactly what they are they're straight identified guys they're not

[01:30:47.980 --> 01:30:51.940]
straight because they've had some gay sex and you discussed it yourself with

[01:30:51.940 --> 01:30:55.180]
that other guy you're born with an orientation what other guy the guy that

[01:30:55.180 --> 01:30:57.560]
said remember the guy that uh... that uh... that uh... the guy with the

[01:30:57.560 --> 01:31:02.800]
former that uh... you know you choose to be what you are right you know you

[01:31:02.800 --> 01:31:07.700]
realize it you are very said realize that you decide that so what we do what you

[01:31:07.700 --> 01:31:11.240]
realize it is that because you certainly don't decide you realize that you come to

[01:31:11.240 --> 01:31:14.780]
grips of our music we're all before and what you're attracted to all of our

[01:31:14.780 --> 01:31:18.660]
we are just like uh... just like some of my thoughts and to visit and got five

[01:31:18.660 --> 01:31:22.140]
three or we want what you are and you're born that way and it doesn't matter what

[01:31:22.140 --> 01:31:27.040]
you leave it and it doesn't matter if you're embarrassed to identify yourself as

[01:31:27.040 --> 01:31:31.320]
a bisexual person if you have the ability to willingly engage in sex with a

[01:31:31.320 --> 01:31:35.100]
you know it's really ironic that you go through all this because generally speaking

[01:31:35.100 --> 01:31:38.380]
uh... when we talk about anything that has to with gay you have a line it's a good

[01:31:38.380 --> 01:31:41.580]
it's a great line you've been saying it for years what's it to you what do you

[01:31:41.580 --> 01:31:46.520]
care here i don't care in fact that's one of the main reasons i don't ask because

[01:31:46.520 --> 01:31:49.560]
i don't know if i can you know if if they're ready to a rock and roll that's

[01:31:49.560 --> 01:31:52.840]
fine with me i don't really need any identification i don't know how to

[01:31:52.840 --> 01:31:56.940]
idea must have worried about their age uh... it's stuff like that you know words have

[01:31:56.940 --> 01:32:01.140]
actual definitions and i know that's how that's how you would like to say words

[01:32:01.140 --> 01:32:05.500]
do mean so that's right but they don't mean anything to me see i don't care well i

[01:32:05.500 --> 01:32:09.320]
don't care that's fine but some of us use words correctly

[01:32:12.340 --> 01:32:13.360]
and like to

[01:32:15.700 --> 01:32:18.340]
and some of us could pay a lot of money but that's beside the point

[01:32:19.160 --> 01:32:23.540]
i'll take the money so i make mistakes would be my first mistake do i make mistakes

[01:32:23.540 --> 01:32:28.500]
but i think a lot of it no a lot of guys play some gay guys want to play along

[01:32:28.500 --> 01:32:31.780]
with that fantasy because they you know they think it'll cut into their action i

[01:32:31.780 --> 01:32:35.480]
don't have a fantasy of a label okay i don't have that kind of a fantasy my

[01:32:35.480 --> 01:32:39.200]
fantasy would be that my friend from Berlin from my summer during the world cup

[01:32:39.200 --> 01:32:42.040]
which if i could draw you a picture you would a lot of you people would soon

[01:32:42.040 --> 01:32:45.640]
fall in the form say that can't be possible not you knew it was just one of those

[01:32:45.640 --> 01:32:49.240]
miracle experiences okay that would be my fantasy okay is that i hope there's

[01:32:49.240 --> 01:32:52.580]
a knock on the door right now i open the door and there he is okay

[01:32:53.180 --> 01:32:56.640]
wobbling in here saying on with with a little bit of luggage saying a toothbrush

[01:32:57.200 --> 01:33:01.100]
and uh... whatever else in the order and i'm staying that would be my fantasy okay

[01:33:02.580 --> 01:33:06.600]
and i would say well let me ask you are you had a recessional are you one to six

[01:33:06.600 --> 01:33:10.100]
on a rick jisky i just say hey the show be over one thirty i wouldn't even say

[01:33:10.100 --> 01:33:13.380]
the show be over one thirty i come running right back in here say oh i got a bad

[01:33:13.380 --> 01:33:16.300]
headache to your your all this all started years ago because you were talking about

[01:33:16.300 --> 01:33:21.400]
how great it is to get a straight guy that has sex with you and i laugh you are you

[01:33:21.400 --> 01:33:24.700]
are crazy person okay i talked about how great it was to get a

[01:33:24.700 --> 01:33:29.520]
some other sex to some other fact we're in the w i would be i would never said

[01:33:29.520 --> 01:33:34.060]
that in my life and i and i laugh and i hear what's so fire said you never had

[01:33:34.060 --> 01:33:39.940]
sex with a straight on you got really upset you still are to this day

[01:33:39.940 --> 01:33:41.100]
but i put this

[01:33:41.960 --> 01:33:44.940]
coming with like tom Brady for example since he's in the news and he's in

[01:33:44.940 --> 01:33:48.980]
pregnancy every slot in the i mean every broad in the world i would like

[01:33:48.980 --> 01:33:52.060]
when i look at sex with tom Brady who's very heterosexual yes you have sex

[01:33:52.060 --> 01:33:55.680]
with me no i'm ever going to meet tom Brady no so cares how about Brady Quinn he

[01:33:55.680 --> 01:33:59.040]
would do in a pinch you know i pinch it and a lot of people that are cheating on

[01:33:59.040 --> 01:34:02.020]
their wise but they would never consider themselves an adulterer because that

[01:34:02.020 --> 01:34:04.980]
would be too embarrassing so they call themselves monogamous but that doesn't make it

[01:34:04.980 --> 01:34:05.200]
so

[01:34:05.200 --> 01:34:05.560]
a

[01:34:06.420 --> 01:34:06.780]
a

[01:34:08.940 --> 01:34:12.020]
and three words Gary san rewere the other day too

[01:34:12.520 --> 01:34:14.480]
Gary san had a cheeseburger and they have one

[01:34:14.480 --> 01:34:18.060]
make it nice during i would put trough in every piece of his food i just have three

[01:34:18.060 --> 01:34:20.140]
words for you George remember the bird

[01:34:22.840 --> 01:34:23.200]
wow

[01:34:23.780 --> 01:34:26.860]
i don't know actually aren't you the guy that no i'm not but aren't you the guy

[01:34:26.860 --> 01:34:29.280]
something well you know you're going to get this new deal and if norm is

[01:34:29.280 --> 01:34:32.780]
listening make sure he takes me care of your what did i say today what did i say

[01:34:32.780 --> 01:34:35.760]
on the air yesterday take care of George is that what i said you did

[01:34:36.460 --> 01:34:40.380]
and now you're giving me crap making up stuff that i said years ago about how i

[01:34:40.380 --> 01:34:40.560]
was

[01:34:40.560 --> 01:34:45.020]
what was it again what was the phrase you had sex with straight guys and how great

[01:34:45.020 --> 01:34:48.100]
it is that's not what you said that i said you you claim that you and somebody

[01:34:48.100 --> 01:34:51.320]
guy were talking about how great it is when you can get straight guys to have

[01:34:51.320 --> 01:34:52.000]
sex with you

[01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:55.300]
no when you get hot guy stands sex with not straight not gay

[01:34:55.300 --> 01:34:59.540]
that's why hot hot hot hot remember that campaign they ran on channel four years ago

[01:34:59.540 --> 01:35:01.480]
over a new and remember that song hot hot hot hot

[01:35:01.480 --> 01:35:05.240]
that's how this argument started anyway there is no argument i don't care

[01:35:05.240 --> 01:35:08.700]
don't you understand i care less about this than almost anything in the world

[01:35:08.700 --> 01:35:12.540]
because it's so it's so ludicrous hearing you sitting right there pontificating

[01:35:12.540 --> 01:35:16.300]
they have today about gay people in the sex that we have and who we're doing

[01:35:16.300 --> 01:35:19.400]
and who we're not doing and what they are welcome about it i don't care it's

[01:35:19.400 --> 01:35:23.260]
it's of no interest to make probably some of the people if somehow looking young

[01:35:23.260 --> 01:35:27.280]
with thing some female came in here right now about 20 years old as hot as could be

[01:35:27.280 --> 01:35:31.440]

[01:38:30.400 --> 01:38:31.120]

they're out there but they're not making any new ones

[01:38:48.960 --> 01:38:51.340]
that's one of the things i would like to go back

[01:38:51.340 --> 01:38:52.520]
is to being a kid

[01:38:52.520 --> 01:38:54.760]
i used to go to number 8 school and watch this

[01:38:54.760 --> 01:38:55.200]
you're okay

[01:38:56.560 --> 01:38:57.600]
in elementary school

[01:38:57.600 --> 01:38:58.900]
and kindergarten

[01:38:58.900 --> 01:38:59.560]
and first grade

[01:39:01.900 --> 01:39:03.660]
and right across from the school

[01:39:03.660 --> 01:39:05.200]
was Louis Sussman's newsstand

[01:39:06.180 --> 01:39:07.500]
now is that something i remember his name

[01:39:07.500 --> 01:39:08.880]
and i remember one year i mentioned that year

[01:39:08.880 --> 01:39:10.460]
oh i remember Louis Sussman's brother

[01:39:10.460 --> 01:39:12.360]
it's like i had to talk about Steve Lawrence's brother

[01:39:12.360 --> 01:39:13.780]
who used to be the elevator operator

[01:39:13.780 --> 01:39:14.740]
it's a ghostly

[01:39:14.740 --> 01:39:17.120]
remember the hump ornogues to talk about that all of the time

[01:39:19.100 --> 01:39:20.980]
Louis Sussman was the guy and he had a

[01:39:20.980 --> 01:39:23.220]
a newsstand back in the day

[01:39:23.220 --> 01:39:24.360]
and it was telling like

[01:39:24.740 --> 01:39:25.960]
stowings and um...

[01:39:26.640 --> 01:39:27.680]
faggots and stuff like that

[01:39:27.680 --> 01:39:29.880]
and comic books and baseball cards

[01:39:31.200 --> 01:39:33.040]
and so when you were a kid back in those days

[01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:34.520]
that's the weird stuff in your time

[01:39:34.520 --> 01:39:36.360]
you were buying condoms back in those days

[01:39:36.360 --> 01:39:37.700]
like now let's see what this is

[01:39:37.700 --> 01:39:40.040]
i mean this is an ongoing frisk i guess

[01:39:40.040 --> 01:39:40.880]
wants to own segment

[01:39:40.880 --> 01:39:43.600]
one thing about the people online here that you get in touch with

[01:39:43.600 --> 01:39:44.760]
you notice they all

[01:39:45.460 --> 01:39:47.060]
all of them i don't think there's any exception

[01:39:47.060 --> 01:39:48.300]
they all become hand bones

[01:39:48.300 --> 01:39:49.660]
you know i mean they want these celebrities

[01:39:50.200 --> 01:39:52.300]
that's always fine yeah i have no problem with that

[01:39:52.680 --> 01:39:53.980]
we can use some good material

[01:39:53.980 --> 01:39:55.800]
i mean it's not as exciting as reading the newspaper

[01:39:55.800 --> 01:39:56.480]
the phone director

[01:39:56.480 --> 01:39:59.480]
but then what is paper and plastic and aluminum foil

[01:39:59.480 --> 01:40:02.300]
now you see you didn't understand what i was talking about did you with a tin foil

[01:40:02.300 --> 01:40:04.200]
sure i did i have the same problem sometimes

[01:40:04.200 --> 01:40:06.680]
oh i mean i have a problem almost all the time

[01:40:06.680 --> 01:40:08.100]
in fact if i can get through a whole

[01:40:08.100 --> 01:40:09.440]
role of aluminum foil

[01:40:09.860 --> 01:40:12.020]
why do i keep calling that everybody calls it tin foil

[01:40:12.020 --> 01:40:13.960]
but that's where aluminum foil you may want

[01:40:13.960 --> 01:40:16.220]
without like shredding like so it comes out

[01:40:16.220 --> 01:40:19.640]
like in little slices like i feel like i really had a major conference

[01:40:19.640 --> 01:40:21.120]
there's my mother but there's a method

[01:40:22.680 --> 01:40:24.200]
let's see it says if you ever need

[01:40:24.200 --> 01:40:24.780]
or

[01:40:28.040 --> 01:40:31.180]
in other words he's i said to him about the line about

[01:40:31.180 --> 01:40:33.860]
a winning back our money i said what time is your show on

[01:40:33.860 --> 01:40:34.680]
he said if you ever need to other

[01:40:34.680 --> 01:40:36.400]
ever your crew he's it

[01:40:38.860 --> 01:40:41.120]
and then he says going back to your line

[01:40:41.120 --> 01:40:44.040]
this whole business because he's is he's even more adamant than you are

[01:40:44.040 --> 01:40:47.900]
he hates tami like you know when somebody starts typing in capital letters with the many

[01:40:47.900 --> 01:40:50.900]
optimization points you know they're worked up into a frenzy

[01:40:50.900 --> 01:40:52.140]
no no just because she's crazy

[01:40:52.140 --> 01:40:56.240]
she's so funny but he just hates her like poisoned for whatever reason and i think you know

[01:40:56.240 --> 01:40:58.000]
he's sucking up to you i think he wants you

[01:40:58.000 --> 01:40:59.900]
well he's by you know i understand

[01:40:59.900 --> 01:41:02.500]
he hasn't seen you yet wait till you see George christ you might change your mind

[01:41:02.500 --> 01:41:03.960]
nobody will see you see me you probably

[01:41:03.960 --> 01:41:05.200]
shut off this whole thing

[01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:06.400]
what

[01:41:07.540 --> 01:41:09.780]
i usually don't have bad sex because

[01:41:09.780 --> 01:41:12.180]
i'm just that then good is what he said

[01:41:12.180 --> 01:41:13.720]
that after a while

[01:41:14.680 --> 01:41:17.780]
well that's true bad sex is a rare thing you know how

[01:41:17.780 --> 01:41:22.200]
that happened no i would not agree with that there is such a thing there is such

[01:41:22.200 --> 01:41:25.860]
a rare once a part of time i would have argued with that but uh... you're right

[01:41:26.680 --> 01:41:27.880]
it's rare but it happens

[01:41:29.060 --> 01:41:33.920]
yes and of course now see i'm assuming christ understands i'm talking about with a partner

[01:41:35.340 --> 01:41:38.340]
i said i said yeah because he says i don't

[01:41:38.340 --> 01:41:42.160]
because i'm just that damn good it doesn't make any of us how good you are but if you're and of course

[01:41:42.160 --> 01:41:46.180]
that also goes back to the thing i was talking about in the last hour about the difference between gay

[01:41:46.180 --> 01:41:48.360]
sex which certainly leaves many more um

[01:41:49.160 --> 01:41:52.980]
oh what's the term i was going to use i don't say openings but that's a very bad choice

[01:41:52.980 --> 01:41:54.560]
no that was a bad choice of words

[01:41:55.140 --> 01:41:57.860]
uh... options is the law looking for options

[01:41:58.980 --> 01:42:02.560]
as opposed to the desperation of the simultaneous orgasm

[01:42:02.560 --> 01:42:05.420]
which you know back in the day of course before all this woman's lip think yeah

[01:42:05.420 --> 01:42:07.180]
guys didn't give a crap about that let me tell you

[01:42:07.180 --> 01:42:10.960]
it isn't the simultaneous orgasm it's just getting them to have one

[01:42:10.960 --> 01:42:13.000]
yeah well that's that's what i'm saying yeah

[01:42:13.920 --> 01:42:17.980]
as opposed to the guys where we know it's all uh very easily accomplished

[01:42:17.980 --> 01:42:20.600]
that is correct there are do we have a's

[01:42:21.560 --> 01:42:25.580]
John Nichols writes i think you didn't think i'd get back to this with all this sex talk we got going on

[01:42:25.580 --> 01:42:27.820]
here i feel like dr. root early sold enough

[01:42:28.800 --> 01:42:30.720]
Vermont folks to impeach bush and training

[01:42:30.720 --> 01:42:32.460]
all right now we're talking heavy duty

[01:42:33.780 --> 01:42:35.320]
are you cracking your knuckles again?

[01:42:35.380 --> 01:42:36.100]
yes i am

[01:42:36.100 --> 01:42:38.200]
boy that's our crack expert

[01:42:40.020 --> 01:42:42.800]
what are how long this thing goes on oh brother

[01:42:42.800 --> 01:42:43.980]
well how long get it in there

[01:42:43.980 --> 01:42:46.780]
i'll read as much as i can and i'll chop myself off

[01:42:46.780 --> 01:42:47.920]
so to speak

[01:42:47.920 --> 01:42:51.300]
now Vermont Governor Jim Douglas of Republican with reasonably close ties to

[01:42:51.300 --> 01:42:54.560]
president bush asked if there was any additional business to be considered at the

[01:42:54.560 --> 01:42:56.220]
town meeting who was running a middlebury Vermont

[01:42:56.220 --> 01:42:59.880]
Ellen McKay popped up and proposed the impeachment abortion vice president

[01:42:59.880 --> 01:43:01.520]
Dick Cheney to which we say

[01:43:01.520 --> 01:43:04.680]
the governor was not amused he's a Republican

[01:43:04.680 --> 01:43:08.180]
his moderator of the annual meeting tried to suggest that they proposal to impeach

[01:43:08.180 --> 01:43:11.540]
along with another proposal to withdraw US troops from where i could not be voted on

[01:43:12.220 --> 01:43:15.760]
but McKay a program coordinator at middlebury college pressed her case

[01:43:15.760 --> 01:43:22.140]
and it soon became evident that the crowd at the annual meeting shared her desire to hold a president to account so Douglas backed down

[01:43:22.140 --> 01:43:24.600]
it became clear that no one was going home until

[01:43:24.600 --> 01:43:27.960]
added sense to discuss the resolution that voted him explain David Rosenberg

[01:43:28.540 --> 01:43:28.980]
Rosenberg

[01:43:28.980 --> 01:43:33.620]
a political scientist professor middlebury college and being a good politician he allowed the vote to happen

[01:43:34.200 --> 01:43:38.160]
by an overwhelming voice vote middlebury called for impeachment so it's gone this way

[01:43:38.160 --> 01:43:40.580]
could tell meetings across Vermont most of which were held Tuesday

[01:43:41.220 --> 01:43:46.420]
as Bruce Williams would say Tuesday and why he says that i have no idea probably because he's an a-hole

[01:43:46.960 --> 01:43:51.480]
late Tuesday night there were confirmed reports that 36 towns had backed in

[01:43:51.480 --> 01:43:53.400]
impeachment resolutions and numbers expected to rise

[01:43:53.400 --> 01:43:56.740]
in one town putty the vote for impeachment was unanimous

[01:43:56.740 --> 01:43:58.880]
I wonder if that was named after channel 10's Michael putty

[01:43:58.880 --> 01:44:03.640]
who's a nice guy of it is boring as oh listening to paint dry not even watching it just listening

[01:44:04.080 --> 01:44:07.600]
and additionally governor Douglas is middlebury the town of heartland which is on the congressman

[01:44:07.600 --> 01:44:12.180]
Peter wealth backed in impeachment so to the Jericho well i wonder if the walls are crumbling down

[01:44:12.180 --> 01:44:16.880]
home of gay siamington what have a name is gay the speaker of the Vermont House of Representatives

[01:44:16.880 --> 01:44:22.320]
g-a-y-e gay a-a-a-a that's a female i know that's why that's why spelt it you

[01:44:22.320 --> 01:44:26.180]
smelt it nice spelt it organizes his grassroots draft to get town meetings to

[01:44:26.180 --> 01:44:29.320]
back impeachment resolutions hope that the overwhelming support the initiative is received

[01:44:29.320 --> 01:44:33.320]
will convince wealth to introduce articles of impeachment against bush and cheney that's

[01:44:33.320 --> 01:44:37.180]
something the democratic congressman is resisting even though his predecessor Bernie Sanders

[01:44:37.180 --> 01:44:41.280]
signed on last year a proposal by michigan congressman john congers to set up a house committee

[01:44:41.280 --> 01:44:46.080]
to look into impeachment well you realize we just got an hour to go to lie awful back to ball at all

[01:44:46.080 --> 01:44:50.900]
i feel really cheated today not and then of course tomorrow's payday not

[01:44:50.900 --> 01:44:54.380]
and Chris is not too happy so i stub

[01:44:55.960 --> 01:45:00.400]
well i already got paid he has a mirror yeah if you if i was as bad as you are man i'd have

[01:45:00.400 --> 01:45:04.640]
difficulty seeing mine and thank you now i for my activists also want to legislate to

[01:45:04.640 --> 01:45:08.340]
approve articles of impeachment before them to congress but sign in to also a democrat is

[01:45:08.340 --> 01:45:12.420]
discouraging initiative despite the fact that more than 20 representatives of correspondent impeachment

[01:45:12.420 --> 01:45:18.620]
resolution spieless democrats man there's another one for you gay signings no one of the color gay

[01:45:18.620 --> 01:45:23.060]
you know i want to be hard for peter wellson gay signing to say there's no cement for impeachment

[01:45:23.060 --> 01:45:27.540]
now that our towns have voted for it since dandy walled of new fame from mod town select man has

[01:45:27.540 --> 01:45:30.820]
started the impeachment initiative last year in his town and now pants the launching campaign

[01:45:30.820 --> 01:45:35.500]
to pressure well since i'm in to respect and reflect the will of the people it's going to be even

[01:45:35.500 --> 01:45:38.980]
harder for governor dog was who just this month spent two nights at the bush white house to face

[01:45:38.980 --> 01:45:42.920]
his president after all dog was now is in town that's on record in the port of bush's impeachment

[01:45:42.920 --> 01:45:49.520]
trial for high crimes and misdemeanors and it goes on and on about all the different parts of the

[01:45:49.520 --> 01:45:53.320]
resident resolution but a bit better but uh... john nico's new book by the way the genius of

[01:46:33.300 --> 01:46:38.460]

i'm sure it'll happen well i mean it's going to be a long ways off but yeah

[01:47:43.400 --> 01:47:45.540]
two thousand would be such a spectacular number

fifty minutes till basketball time is there any of this audience okay here here's

[01:48:56.820 --> 01:48:57.480]
a great idea

[01:48:58.920 --> 01:49:01.660]
because these people have nothing to talk about today there's nothing going on

[01:49:01.660 --> 01:49:04.840]
is that it did people in a rack and more dead soldiers and stuff like that but

[01:49:04.840 --> 01:49:07.760]
they're so used to that by now you know they've been uh... like fate that always

[02:06:26.960 --> 02:06:32.340]
riff rap that's the kind of swill that's the kind of walking manure that populates such a gigantic

And the crystal is listening right now, George's long-suffering wife...

[02:09:51.280 --> 02:09:54.600]
Don't get me in the middle of this, okay, I got none to do with this, okay?

[02:09:55.180 --> 02:09:56.660]
What's she gonna do, bitch, more?

[02:09:57.480 --> 02:10:03.280]
You know something today has been, I don't know what it is, if the rain of the sun is shining or the finally we're thung...

[02:10:03.280 --> 02:10:07.860]
I'll have a little bit up here, what the deal is, my brain finally...

[02:10:07.860 --> 02:10:13.820]
Unstamp, I mean, in regard to everything, you know all the things that we talk about all the time and all my...

[02:10:14.880 --> 02:10:18.620]
Everything finally snapped into place, I'll send you the morning, all about it.

[02:10:18.840 --> 02:10:21.080]
Excellent. I'll tell you when others about it, they're more...

[02:10:22.100 --> 02:10:24.220]
I'm serious, I'm just finally, I am too.

[02:10:25.800 --> 02:10:31.160]
I mean, and you should have, of all people, you should have done this a long time ago, but you didn't, but that's alright.

[02:10:31.460 --> 02:10:32.960]
You liked the angst and the drama.

[02:10:33.120 --> 02:10:33.620]
Should have done what?

[02:10:34.020 --> 02:10:37.220]
It says, awesome, trust me, they will be thanking me when they see her.

[02:10:38.700 --> 02:10:41.200]
And I'm not gonna get you in touch with him, how do I do that?

[02:10:42.520 --> 02:10:43.860]
Tell him to send me in this, I've done Myspace.

[02:10:45.060 --> 02:10:47.860]
Oh yeah, why don't you do it? Yeah, why do I gotta be the pimp here, huh?

[02:10:49.240 --> 02:10:50.860]
You know, it's hard out there for a pimp.

[02:10:53.480 --> 02:10:56.160]
Come on, you can do it Chris, you can find George's...

[02:10:57.040 --> 02:11:01.880]
Right there, right, I'm one of your top friends, just click on my top friends right on the way they look for me.

[02:11:02.020 --> 02:11:07.940]
I mean, Jessica Simpson, there you go, bouncing Jessica, as George is remembering those days when Jessica was sitting right across the table,

[02:11:08.220 --> 02:11:11.680]
and he kept reaching up on the table, and trying to grab a little sump and some from so.

[02:11:12.980 --> 02:11:16.440]
Being the lx that he is, he was actually very nice.

[02:11:17.140 --> 02:11:19.480]
So, with NICE, I'm sure she was very nice.

[02:11:19.920 --> 02:11:21.960]
I wish NIC would be sitting across the table for me right now.

[02:11:22.240 --> 02:11:26.440]
You know, it's interesting, remember that Alan Guy, his mother called that one time, and he started that...

[02:11:27.720 --> 02:11:30.880]
The Myspace thing for celebrities, whatever the hell it was, I forget what the name was.

[02:11:31.040 --> 02:11:31.620]
Right, yeah, whatever it is.

[02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:34.900]
And NIC was sharing his one of the people on there, and he said, oh I'm gonna get into touch with him.

[02:11:35.120 --> 02:11:40.420]
And at one time I got something from that Alan Guy, it was kind of like incoherent to make any sense,

[02:11:40.760 --> 02:11:42.780]
and it was something about NIC, but it wasn't really NIC.

[02:11:42.780 --> 02:11:45.400]
It was somebody talking, I don't know what it was.

[02:11:45.440 --> 02:11:46.260]
And it's like, oh my god.

[02:11:46.440 --> 02:11:49.080]
When you're a big star like NIC, you know, you can't be bright into sluggers.

[02:11:50.200 --> 02:11:51.040]
He would write to me.

[02:11:51.460 --> 02:11:55.760]
I mean, if Johnny Depp is writing to Johnny G, then certainly NIC is gonna write to old...

[02:11:55.760 --> 02:11:57.240]
NIC for Dan Schud.

[02:11:57.280 --> 02:11:59.180]
I'm trying to come up with my music, go into the ballgame.

[02:12:00.020 --> 02:12:00.980]
Oh, I know what it might be.

[02:12:01.040 --> 02:12:02.320]
We may have had a vocal with Stepon.

[02:12:02.680 --> 02:12:03.060]
It would be good.

[02:12:03.520 --> 02:12:04.580]
Al Martino, all this.

[02:12:06.580 --> 02:12:08.300]
One half, one half, one half, one half.

[02:12:08.300 --> 02:12:09.260]
It's so schmaltzy.

[02:12:09.260 --> 02:12:11.000]
It's so schmaltzy.

[02:12:11.560 --> 02:12:13.500]
I got to update my monovony collection.

[02:12:14.020 --> 02:12:14.640]
Yeah, there you go.

[02:12:14.720 --> 02:12:16.180]
A little monovony would be good before the game.

[02:12:16.500 --> 02:12:17.520]
Put everybody into a coma.

[02:12:17.920 --> 02:12:20.260]
It will be probably about 201, or maybe 131.

[02:12:21.580 --> 02:12:22.140]
What is that?

[02:12:23.260 --> 02:12:24.540]
It's a city in Paster Island.

[02:12:25.160 --> 02:12:26.480]
It's a city in Paster Island.

[02:12:26.700 --> 02:12:26.800]
It's a city in Paster Island.

[02:12:26.800 --> 02:12:27.220]
It's a city in Paster Island.

[02:12:27.400 --> 02:12:29.940]
Is this one they were walking around with the sheep and epilonia and whatnot?

[02:12:31.640 --> 02:12:32.260]
Bodyguards with the shotguns.

[02:12:32.820 --> 02:12:34.520]
I'm not rather here that.

[02:12:35.920 --> 02:12:39.220]
That's, you know...

[02:12:40.660 --> 02:12:42.380]
This one sounds so much more ominous.

[02:12:44.700 --> 02:12:46.660]
Then some more ominous, a seabull.

[02:12:46.980 --> 02:12:48.780]
She used to be the traffic lady at Dianne's Z.

[02:12:48.880 --> 02:12:49.220]
I'm this.

[02:12:50.100 --> 02:12:50.720]
What a memory.

[02:12:51.020 --> 02:12:51.620]
Oh yeah, I like this.

[02:12:52.780 --> 02:12:54.700]
But it's very, it's like George's very short.

[02:12:56.160 --> 02:12:59.440]
So if I was you, I'd keep your eye peeled for a e-mail from my buddy, Chris.

[02:13:01.640 --> 02:13:02.720]
Oh, I love this.

[02:13:02.920 --> 02:13:03.860]
Now here's schmaltz, baby.

[02:13:03.980 --> 02:13:06.380]
If you want the definition of schmaltz, enough hard enough to talk about schmaltz, hearing.

[02:13:06.380 --> 02:13:09.720]
Just general plain old everyday, Yiddish schmaltz.

[02:13:09.720 --> 02:13:10.360]
This is it.

[02:13:10.520 --> 02:13:12.140]
With the bunch of voices, the singing.

[02:13:13.420 --> 02:13:15.020]
And the Jew from Miami, Hymen Roth.

[02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:18.100]
Maybe that's where they got the schmaltz from all of a sudden.

[02:13:18.360 --> 02:13:19.740]
That was from Hymen Roth.

[02:13:19.900 --> 02:13:20.160]
What do you think?

[02:13:20.880 --> 02:13:21.340]
They'd be?

[02:13:21.680 --> 02:13:22.820]
Or maybe from Ugaath.

[02:13:22.940 --> 02:13:25.180]
I like how he was kicking back in that chair there in Florida.

[02:13:25.700 --> 02:13:27.080]
Hymen Roth, he had a leg up there.

[02:13:27.700 --> 02:13:30.520]
Yeah, but then when he took his shirt off and I once seen his leg up back in a couch.

[02:13:30.860 --> 02:13:33.900]
We don't want to see a 90-year-old man with a hairy, white-haired chest.

[02:13:34.280 --> 02:13:35.160]
Oh, fat.

[02:13:35.400 --> 02:13:37.100]
I don't care what persuasion you may be.

[02:13:37.360 --> 02:13:39.140]
Although Pat Boone said friendly persuasion.

[02:13:40.240 --> 02:13:40.700]
Did he?

[02:13:41.080 --> 02:13:41.560]
He did.

[02:13:41.720 --> 02:13:43.700]
He's saying friendly persuasion on dot records in my front.

[02:13:43.780 --> 02:13:44.760]
I bet you have that in there.

[02:13:45.760 --> 02:13:46.480]
Friendly persuasion.

[02:13:46.540 --> 02:13:47.860]
I think you only got Moody River.

[02:13:48.260 --> 02:13:49.040]
I like that Moody River.

[02:13:49.440 --> 02:13:51.860]
I must confess that back in the day I loved Pat Boone.

[02:13:51.920 --> 02:13:53.980]
Now I hit him like poison because he's the right wing religious phony.

[02:13:54.220 --> 02:13:56.120]
If I could go a piece of crap.

[02:13:56.840 --> 02:13:57.400]
There you go.

[02:13:57.500 --> 02:13:57.880]
Moody River.

[02:13:57.960 --> 02:13:58.580]
What I'd tell you.

[02:14:00.940 --> 02:14:01.660]
1958, 1959.

[02:14:02.080 --> 02:14:02.680]
Somewhere around there.

[02:14:04.480 --> 02:14:04.840]
1960.

[02:14:05.360 --> 02:14:06.300]
Like I said, 20.

[02:14:06.380 --> 02:14:07.200]
I was 60 words, sorry.

[02:14:07.600 --> 02:14:09.120]
I was getting up to you.

[02:14:09.200 --> 02:14:09.720]
You chopped me short.

[02:14:10.020 --> 02:14:10.420]
So does me.

[02:14:11.100 --> 02:14:11.580]
Okay, that's enough.

[02:14:11.780 --> 02:14:12.320]
Kill him, man.

[02:14:12.460 --> 02:14:13.180]
Pat Boone.

[02:14:13.620 --> 02:14:15.960]
Pat Boone wrote a book, twist 12 and 20.

[02:14:16.400 --> 02:14:17.140]
And don't do this.

[02:14:17.420 --> 02:14:18.160]
And don't touch that.

[02:14:18.380 --> 02:14:19.260]
And don't think these things.

[02:14:19.400 --> 02:14:21.360]
And man, in the meantime, he was doing everything that move.

[02:14:21.580 --> 02:14:22.060]
Pat Boone.

[02:14:23.460 --> 02:14:25.400]
Would like to have done him back then as a matter of fact.

[02:14:25.520 --> 02:14:27.420]
But I can't say that on the air because that sounds very gay.

[02:14:28.180 --> 02:14:28.940]
107 at 5.

[02:14:28.940 --> 02:14:29.900]
60 WNQM.

[02:14:30.240 --> 02:14:31.260]
Junior honey.

[02:14:32.380 --> 02:15:01.100]
I'm going to have a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of

[02:15:23.400 --> 02:15:31.080]
a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a

[02:15:31.080 --> 02:16:01.040]
little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little

[02:16:01.040 --> 02:16:29.180]
You know, at octurt candy yeah, that's all right. We have a Links to All Right so inORTER 1,bags.

[02:16:29.180 --> 02:16:33.660]
to GPS. To show you how the demographics of the market have changed, used to be the

[02:16:33.660 --> 02:16:37.680]
great WGBS 710. In fact, it's at 710, Berkall Avenue. Are you aware of that?

[02:16:38.060 --> 02:16:38.320]
No.

[02:16:38.700 --> 02:16:40.600]
Isn't that ironic? There's 710 on the dial.

[02:16:40.980 --> 02:16:42.840]
I don't know how they ever swung that. What?

[02:16:43.360 --> 02:16:43.760]
Coincidence.

[02:16:44.320 --> 02:16:47.420]
Let me get out. There are coincidences in my ass. My pimpley ass.

[02:16:48.540 --> 02:16:53.840]
Anyway, he was also a regular on Mesa Revuelta, a round table discussion on which the

[02:16:53.840 --> 02:16:58.780]
main topic was usually Castro. And Castro is alive, and now this poor guy Augustin

[02:16:58.780 --> 02:17:03.260]
Thamada go. He's dead. Now what am I looking for? Sports. Okay. I hate to do this on the

[02:17:03.260 --> 02:17:08.780]
air, but I mean, Chris leaves me no choice. You leave me no choice, man. Let's see.

[02:17:08.840 --> 02:17:12.320]
Let me go. I heard his sports sports. Oh, I'm glad I said that. But it turns like

[02:17:12.320 --> 02:17:17.920]
it. Let's see. You have an FSU to go for an tournament. The Bapapapa. A need to go for

[02:17:17.920 --> 02:17:22.640]
an tournament. Now let's see what it says here. This is the hero to keep in mind. So it

[02:17:22.640 --> 02:17:26.380]
might not be easy to figure out. Where's the thing where it says radio and TV and what's

[02:17:26.380 --> 02:17:35.020]
on and et cetera and so on? Can't find it. Oh God. Let's see. Colleges. UM. Okay.

[02:17:35.180 --> 02:17:39.480]
UM, basically, UM baseball. I don't care about UM baseball here right now. We're talking

[02:17:39.480 --> 02:17:48.320]
about the hoops, man. Hoops. Where the hell is it? Watch. Listen. Think. Hurricane's

[02:17:48.320 --> 02:17:55.840]
basketball at a glance in your pants. No chance. Like romance. No, seriously. I just

[02:17:55.840 --> 02:18:02.100]
all of a sudden about 10 minutes ago. My brain snapped back into place. My my space.

[02:18:02.300 --> 02:18:06.040]
No, seriously, my my space lunacy just all vanished. They just finally I just realized

[02:18:06.040 --> 02:18:10.500]
no, seriously, people have a life. People live their lives. People are entitled to live

[02:18:10.500 --> 02:18:14.460]
their lives. Everybody have a great time. That's my you know what I'm saying? I'm going

[02:18:14.460 --> 02:18:18.960]
to start right now. It's all I don't want to wait for 15 minutes. What? Just start having

[02:18:18.960 --> 02:18:23.040]
a great time. I'm going to end up right now because I'm just speaking my way through

[02:18:23.040 --> 02:18:30.380]
these final minutes. I can't find it. This newspaper man on a scale of zero. What kind

[02:18:30.380 --> 02:18:33.960]
of garbage is this? What kind of swill? Like I said, you better find out from somebody

[02:18:33.960 --> 02:18:36.460]
if it's on TV. They're not going to tell you. They think they're going to tell you if

[02:18:36.460 --> 02:18:43.100]
it's on TV. Like, he is. He and of course it'll be on somewhere. If it's the ACC term,

[02:18:43.100 --> 02:18:46.120]
you think that isn't going to be on television somewhere. Mr. You must be dreaming.

[02:18:46.640 --> 02:18:50.860]
You must be in a dream world. Let's see if I can find it here. I know. You know, I'm

[02:18:50.860 --> 02:18:54.580]
going to look for the Sun Central because that's where I found out about what's his name

[02:18:54.980 --> 02:18:59.100]
Sabin Leven. Okay. That day. Yeah. Remember that day? How embarrassing everybody. All

[02:18:59.100 --> 02:19:03.000]
of our being hot shots forced people and I get to scoop on it because it was on the

[02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:07.540]
Sun Central. Sabin announces he's leaving. Okay. New evidence. I didn't lay a release

[02:19:07.540 --> 02:19:10.960]
of autopsy and death of an in the cold smith. We don't care. We don't ever want to hear

[02:19:10.960 --> 02:19:15.680]
about that slut again. Forget about her University of Miami. Okay. I'm clicking on right now

[02:19:16.160 --> 02:19:22.380]
on the Sun. The slum central ACC hoping Florida fans will take note. It says whatever the

[02:19:22.380 --> 02:19:26.940]
hell that means. Now, where let's see? New hurricane coaches got new rules. That's a football.

[02:19:28.200 --> 02:19:32.920]
Where the hell is the radio and TV stuff? Where is it? Can't find it with somebody. Please

[02:19:32.920 --> 02:19:39.460]
tell us. Please. Pretty please. Not inside the building. I can't find it. Can you find

[02:19:39.460 --> 02:19:44.920]
it? No. How about the information? I'm looking. I'm looking. I can't. I can't find

[02:19:44.920 --> 02:19:49.060]
this. University. I mean, well, that's it. I made my effort. I tried. Sun Central and

[02:19:49.060 --> 02:19:53.160]
the hurricane. Find it. Sorry. Maybe somebody on the phone will know. We think somebody

[02:19:53.160 --> 02:19:59.220]
Q. I am. Hello. Good afternoon, Neil. Yes, sir. Is that came on TV? You know? I didn't

[02:19:59.220 --> 02:20:05.300]
hear what you said. Okay. Go ahead. Two things. First of all, how was your trip to wood

[02:20:05.300 --> 02:20:11.920]
mine yesterday? Horrible. Horrible. Just wrote test. Bad. Really bad. No good machines.

[02:20:12.480 --> 02:20:18.480]
No good machines for this kid. No. Okay. Earlier before I left my car to lunch, you mentioned

[02:20:18.480 --> 02:20:25.420]
oh my god, my longest radio accident. Bruce. Yeah. Oh, what? What is an accident? No, right?

[02:20:26.240 --> 02:20:30.700]
Do his day. It's Tuesday. He was. He was horrible. He was horrible. I used to actually

[02:20:30.700 --> 02:20:35.520]
have to admit I had a many months radio accident listening to him before I discovered you

[02:20:35.520 --> 02:20:39.500]
would have been a loyal listener ever since. Okay. Thank you, sir. Have a good day.

[02:20:39.500 --> 02:20:42.940]
And you too. Have a good life. Here's a fact that says let me get this straight. I can

[02:20:42.940 --> 02:20:46.000]
hear the listener. Hurricane's basketball on Q.A.M. or Sid Rosenstein,

[02:20:46.160 --> 02:20:50.100]
Crancburg shorts on the other stage. And that's a tough one. I'm right to listen to the sound of

[02:20:50.100 --> 02:20:55.180]
nails being scratched on a blackboard. Wow. How do you like that for a real shot?

[02:20:56.540 --> 02:21:02.920]
Nails on a blackboard and Sid Rosencrancstein, or Hurricane's basketball. Maybe the worst of all.

[02:21:05.140 --> 02:21:08.500]
Yeah, like the sounds of some horrible sporting event preempting the show.

[02:21:08.500 --> 02:21:12.400]
Not that I'm complaining. I'm delighted. I can start working on my lunch right there. 130.

[02:21:12.920 --> 02:21:16.640]
And I think that's what I'm talking about. Well, Torrent will be on FSN. Fox Sports

[02:21:17.240 --> 02:21:20.940]
now. Absolutely. And tell me of course, let me on TV. It'll be on TV here. Even I could watch it.

[02:21:20.980 --> 02:21:24.080]
Do you think I'm going to be watching that crap? No. You've bet you three life. I'm not going to be

[02:21:24.080 --> 02:21:28.660]
watching that garbage man. Clarence, my ass with all of it. Oh, but the contract says is,

[02:21:28.660 --> 02:21:33.840]
of course, of course, this is the part of the other additional wonderful stuff. And do these sports

[02:21:33.840 --> 02:21:38.100]
teams is that they sign these contracts. But if the sports team is like playing outdoor with a

[02:21:38.100 --> 02:21:42.820]
bunch of 10 year old kids and the game actually means something to them, then we have to carry it

[02:21:42.820 --> 02:21:47.640]
on the air. You're right. They should spot us a point in the rating. They should spot us 15 points

[02:21:47.640 --> 02:21:51.920]
in numbers. If we get a seven share, they give us a 20 to a 22 is what they should give us.

[02:21:53.080 --> 02:21:59.080]
Don't forget the trends are coming up tomorrow. What time? 11 30? Yes. See, I like to sound all

[02:21:59.080 --> 02:22:02.300]
whipped up about this because I know a lot of people out there are very, they they hated. I mean,

[02:22:02.360 --> 02:22:05.940]
a half an hour is in the end of the world. But like when the Marlin's exhibition games on 1250,

[02:22:05.940 --> 02:22:09.940]
that's two hours and 10 minutes that they're losing of this hour and 10. That's not that much either.

[02:22:10.900 --> 02:22:14.640]
Although we'll take it. I'm not knocking it. We'll take it hour and 10 minutes. Where's my? Oh,

[02:22:14.680 --> 02:22:17.660]
I don't forget. Please because nobody's going to know this year. You're all going to get screwed up

[02:22:17.660 --> 02:22:21.560]
Sunday morning Saturday night when you go to bed. Turn the clock ahead now or daylight savings time

[02:22:21.560 --> 02:22:26.860]
comes back early now. They changed the law. Canada, US. Got only knows where else.

[02:22:28.040 --> 02:22:32.220]
Newfoundland. And huh? You know, Foundland. You found out twice. You wrote a newfoundland. You know,

[02:22:32.220 --> 02:22:35.460]
Newfoundland is an hour and a half ahead of where I am right now. I know that's why I said that.

[02:22:35.600 --> 02:22:38.180]
What's with the very first hour? I've only placed in North America. That's like an hour.

[02:22:38.340 --> 02:22:43.560]
I'm going to meet this like a half hour of power and new thing or some idiots would say Newfoundland.

[02:22:44.460 --> 02:22:47.440]
What kind of a moron would say Newfoundland? You know, Newfoundland.

[02:22:50.320 --> 02:22:53.620]
Twenty past there one. If you and we better get with it here because we got that big,

[02:22:53.900 --> 02:22:57.240]
big pregame coming up where Clarence the Man Clarence Darryl. Oh,

[02:22:57.240 --> 02:23:00.960]
is she Gordon Lydia and they don't come any worse than Neil Rogers?

[02:23:02.320 --> 02:23:06.780]
I remember one. There were a lot of people who thought I lost my mind.

[02:23:08.060 --> 02:23:13.700]
When I said global changes were gonna fright. Even polar bears in the Arctic could tell

[02:23:13.700 --> 02:23:20.160]
Earth was a warmer place. Hey, watch me dance now. Boom check a lot a lot of the boob. And I was

[02:23:20.160 --> 02:23:23.660]
out there. No speech prepared and they called my name.

[02:23:25.280 --> 02:23:31.800]
They said Alvor Wands for Enconvigian truth. But that feeling of winning does not compare with

[02:23:31.800 --> 02:23:37.420]
the feeling of standing next to Leonardo. He is cute. This Oscar is my baby.

[02:23:38.600 --> 02:23:43.580]
Oh, Alvor. No Oscar is my baby. No Alvor.

[02:23:43.580 --> 02:23:49.240]
This Oscar is my baby. No Alvor. Best documentary.

[02:23:53.600 --> 02:23:57.000]
Okay, once 25 you're going to begin the email from our buddy Chris sometimes.

[02:23:57.120 --> 02:24:00.840]
I'm kind of push him on it because obviously you're and he says you sound like the poster

[02:24:00.840 --> 02:24:04.760]
job for not getting married and I said you are absolutely correct. Yeah, I just wait

[02:24:04.760 --> 02:24:10.820]
a little bit more. I'm doing a series of lectures. Good idea. Okay, let's take a look at that pool

[02:24:10.820 --> 02:24:13.300]
and then we're going to be out of here pretty soon because we got very Sunday-Rain

[02:24:13.300 --> 02:24:18.920]
muy important. They come up here in a second. What do you miss most about your youth 1226 votes?

[02:24:18.920 --> 02:24:23.280]
Not too bad for a short show and for a really marginal pull question. Sex with young people

[02:24:23.280 --> 02:24:32.200]
my own age 234. Being irresponsible had no real consequences 206. My body 181. Oh, my young

[02:24:32.200 --> 02:24:38.920]
supple body. I never had one. Was it real music 104? My hair 84. Being single 82. American

[02:24:38.920 --> 02:24:43.540]
Americans are were mostly I like to broad 66. Yeah, they liked us once upon a time in America.

[02:24:43.740 --> 02:24:48.960]
Being ignorant as in ignorance is bliss oblivious 51. I hate this pull 49 3.9 percent.

[02:24:49.440 --> 02:24:56.080]
Well too bad. My stamina 41. Real radio 37. Being in school actually learning something 33.

[02:24:56.540 --> 02:25:01.500]
Segregation 32 racist best dollar rolls out there. The cold war because at least we knew who

[02:25:01.500 --> 02:25:07.720]
the enemy was 15. The Ruskies. Kamanista. Kamanista Kamanista. And real newspapers 11.

[02:25:08.980 --> 02:25:12.100]
1226. I guess there are probably a lot of people in South Florida think they really have real

[02:25:12.100 --> 02:25:16.000]
newspapers to which I would say. Oh yeah, make no mistake about that.

[02:25:18.320 --> 02:25:22.720]
So this has been let's see we took we have 20 votes on that in a real quick mini pull 16.

[02:25:22.960 --> 02:25:26.980]
It was actually only 19 16 out of 19. Are you kidding me? We're going to be listening to that stuff.

[02:25:27.240 --> 02:25:32.020]
But it's very important. It's I don't know why. Don't you think it's important? I mean like the

[02:25:32.020 --> 02:25:35.700]
regular season gave us as anybody go they built that new arena there. Anybody go to them? No.

[02:25:36.480 --> 02:25:42.300]
Thousands of empty seats. They needed that arena like they as my grandmother would say

[02:25:42.300 --> 02:25:48.800]
Dr. Xavier Lockincop. You know what it means? That means you need this like a hole in the head.

[02:25:49.220 --> 02:25:53.440]
Dr. Xavier Lockincop. I'm going to tell you man the joy of it is a great you know.

[02:25:53.560 --> 02:25:57.980]
Once her show started. You know she well never dig her up. She was a panic. She was really funny.

[02:25:58.040 --> 02:26:02.580]
If you think my mother was funny I could randomly move aside. Anna Solomon I told you the name was

[02:26:02.700 --> 02:26:06.560]
Angle of it and they changed it to Solomon because they didn't want to be so conspicuously Jewish.

[02:26:06.560 --> 02:26:12.240]
Now what I want to hear is that story. I want to hear as your mother and your grandmother having

[02:26:12.240 --> 02:26:17.120]
an argument. No. No what you want to hear was my mother and my aunt having an argument.

[02:26:17.160 --> 02:26:20.800]
Oh boy. That would really be special. My aunt the reader who's still alive by the way in

[02:26:20.800 --> 02:26:26.620]
Halendale. And I know I never ever again I got that one. I think a couple of times I got an

[02:26:26.620 --> 02:26:33.800]
email from my my cousins kid who's like 29 or 30 whatever right now. Dr. David Christmas time and

[02:26:33.800 --> 02:26:37.720]
I responded and he listens he says he listens with the earphones on gritting from ear to ear every

[02:26:37.720 --> 02:26:41.440]
day and just really excited about this show and being a related to me all the way distant.

[02:26:41.800 --> 02:26:45.400]
And I never heard from him again. Huh. Maybe if I let you were you know Jewish.

[02:26:46.400 --> 02:26:50.380]
He believed me trust me. You think anybody listens to this show for five minutes says no

[02:26:50.380 --> 02:26:55.180]
okay. Oh we still get those calls over and out of here. People still like me.

[02:26:55.360 --> 02:26:58.660]
So but it just actually yelled the other day. What? It might really get

[02:27:01.940 --> 02:27:05.120]
these the folks here from specs. I mean what are we talking about here my gay.

[02:27:05.920 --> 02:27:08.720]
I know I guess it all depends on what the word means. Let's have a

[02:27:08.720 --> 02:27:12.600]
something to debate about there. What does it really mean? That's like a good spot to close.

[02:27:12.820 --> 02:27:17.000]
Happy and get in fact in um Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hatton. That's right.

[02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:22.040]
On the couple nights ago and she said something but oh that's so gay and I thought that's what

[02:27:22.040 --> 02:27:26.460]
all of you can say it's so gay. Yeah drinking that potion was kind of gay too you know.

[02:27:26.820 --> 02:27:31.720]
So gay Dr. Jekyll and Jekyll. What are having the time jiffy by the way he died nobody knows about

[02:27:31.720 --> 02:27:36.240]
the world. Anyway we got you at basketball coming up next to the ACC tournament

[02:27:36.240 --> 02:27:41.880]
temple with clearance and the beast and Joseph Gackie. Oh my god the whole crew needs a

[02:27:41.880 --> 02:27:45.540]
personality transplant. Then we got the hang for it after the game for us at 30.

[02:27:45.540 --> 02:27:50.020]
Panther preview from 6.3 to 7. The Panthers at the 12th of the year flyers.

[02:27:50.100 --> 02:27:53.540]
In other words between now until the present and CSP and radio after that. In other words

[02:27:53.540 --> 02:27:55.280]
till tomorrow morning bye everybody.

[02:27:57.340 --> 02:28:01.640]
For the entire staff management of WQM we wish you a pleasant good evening on Santa.

[02:28:03.180 --> 02:28:07.720]
I believe in America. Good night and made a good news viewers as Ralph Redneck would say if

[02:28:07.720 --> 02:28:10.580]
he were here today. Good night. Listen to me. There you go.

[02:28:15.540 --> 02:28:18.480]
There she's in B2M 4578. Oh look.

[02:28:36.260 --> 02:28:40.720]
Where is it upright? Jesus Christ.

[02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:49.500]
Your music isn't fat. No way is it? It's 130. I know.
