[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200]
Fort Greer radio is what the Q4UL!

[00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:05.760]
Yeah!

[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.780]
Good bad, the Gell!

[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.960]
You did your job real well, but

[00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.920]
That's not what they're looking for

[00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.740]
At Beasley Reed

[00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.620]
You were in satisfying search and fees

[00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.600]
Right-loyal sport, whole-magory

[00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.220]
High-priced scintit penises

[00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.880]
We think very highly of you to hear the red BBGI

[00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.220]
But I'm afraid we're gonna have to let you go

[00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.760]
Hey, what the heck?

[00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.820]
A better job you'll get

[00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.460]
We're at least you'll get a chance

[00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.320]
I'm on the way

[00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.360]
From the sport, whole-mags that can get you

[00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.540]
You failed!

[00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:01.040]
Your friends make sure that they're fast enough to give you

[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.640]
Alright, the bullet also I can tell you the Gell!

[00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:05.700]
Oh, yeah!

[00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.000]
I just hope you'll want to do it

[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.920]
Or a sin, or whatever

[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.240]
It's a 10 or 205 or 60WQM Happy Tuesday all on the A's stay, uh, Huryo

[00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.020]
Okay

[00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.220]
Whatever that means

[00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:20.960]
It's the 10th of July, see

[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.760]
Hey, and we're gonna make a thousand votes on the poll today

[00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.100]
Now, what are you gonna tell me on the air, Chris, or off the air?

[00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.320]
Oh, uh, Josh wants to say he needs a check

[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.120]
It's in the mail

[00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:31.680]
It's already on the way

[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.220]
See, I told you it was really important

[00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:38.780]
It's already on the way

[00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.760]
Let me say it again, mailed it on Friday

[00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.540]
It's on the way, mailed it to George, though

[00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.140]
A George might just sign Josh's name on the back

[00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:46.420]
He might endorse it as Josh quarters

[00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.140]
Because George needs that grand, you know

[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:49.880]
Yeah, at least

[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.260]
So if it doesn't show up Josh, I'd beat up George, okay?

[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.440]
Tom Jicke gives me another little mention here

[00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.000]
It's not even a stoch, not a shot

[00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.700]
How do you like that?

[00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.080]
And this Q&A column yesterday?

[00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.240]
Now, obviously nobody is reading that

[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.680]
Because we didn't get any faxes in the, uh, of this, did we?

[00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:07.240]
Nope, nope, see

[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.840]
Nobody reads your stupid column, Tommy

[00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.880]
Question, I would appreciate knowing where or on what station

[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.780]
Great Viewed Dell is now working

[00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.460]
Oh yeah, I think it's Amaco

[00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.040]
Answer, Viewed Dell has a show on the station in Montgomery, Alabama

[00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.900]
He says it can be heard on the way back

[00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.300]
Alice961.com

[00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.160]
His goal is to someday return to Miami

[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.960]
He jokes that he wants to be the one who takes over Neil Rogers

[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.920]
Show whenever Neil decides to step down

[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.700]
That is not going to happen

[00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:37.920]
Says, little Tommy

[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.720]
That's not my comment, that's Tom Jicke's comment

[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.340]
That is not going to happen

[00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.880]
Very first vacation on your part, little Tommy, it is not going to happen

[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.540]
And I would suggest you are probably...

[00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:48.900]
Absolutely correct

[00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:49.940]
They hate you Greg

[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.100]
They don't like guys named Greg in this market, okay?

[00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:54.440]
Greg, we, Greg, you know

[00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.340]
Guys named Greg, you've never made it too good

[00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.280]
They remember Grego?

[00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.940]
Yeah

[00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.400]
Oh, I think Grego oughta hook up with bowl camera

[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.800]
They could do a show about the smells in the tea room, you know

[00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.880]
And actually, uh, Christel's made a little spire report

[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:17.360]
They really had the right wing born again, Bible thumping, homophobic, mirror for Lauderdale, Jim Nagel on your wrist in the morning show

[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.780]
It's homophobic, expressed in the morning baby

[00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.680]
That's what the sports nerds want, even though these are guys who take showers together naked

[00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:29.240]
And slap each other on the ass, or with their hand, with a towel, with whatever accoutrement they can get their hands on

[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.860]
See, when a guy has his hand, and another guy's ass, you know, there's only one word that comes to my mind

[00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:35.740]
Yeah, that's correct

[00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.380]
I mean, I could be wrong about that, but I don't think so

[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.560]
Anyway, we'll get to that whole thing about, when he'll hang up, what did it say?

[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.980]
Then he'll decide to, uh, whatever, step down

[00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:53.940]
Here's a great story, an 11 year old girl was charged with drug and driving after leaving police on the chastened speeds of up to 100 miles an hour

[00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.840]
That ended when she flipped the car in Alabama Beach town

[00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.440]
11 year old girl know us

[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:05.640]
A video camera in the police car captured the look and surprise on the office of his face when he approached the wreck car and got a look at the motorist

[00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:11.600]
The mobile press registered newspaper said the patrolman saw the Chevy Monte Carlo, why you still have a couple of those?

[00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.240]
One of which, uh, I don't want to go into a whole thing about it

[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:23.000]
Because then I'd have to take the dealer down there in South day and they kept accusing me of using a legged gas and it or something like that

[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.840]
Because it had no acceleration, you'd put your foot through the floor and just would barely move

[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.580]
Yeah, it had issues, Monte Carlo, nice cars though, remember those?

[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.980]
Sure, they looked nice

[00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:33.660]
They still make him?

[00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:34.620]
I think so

[00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:39.480]
Speeding and flashed his lights to signal the driver to stop instead the car spread faster

[00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.660]
Travelling it up to 100 miles an hour before its size swiping another vehicle

[00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.420]
And flipping over the girl post town of Orange Beach, Alabama Tuesday night

[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:54.180]
The young driver who lived in nearby Perdido, Key, Florida, was treated at a hospital for a script in bruises and released relatives

[00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:59.980]
Police also charged her with speeding, leaving the scene of an accident and reckless endangerment

[00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:03.240]
Carbologna relative and police were still trying to find out where she got the booze

[00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.980]
There was none in the vehicle but her blood alcohol level was over the limit for adult motorists

[00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.660]
While she was just having a good time as a...

[00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:10.560]
She was out there right...

[00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.180]
That's what they call a joyride, okay?

[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.180]
Maybe she got motivated by...

[00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:18.960]
She got inspired by Paris Holtin, you think?

[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.240]
Let's only pray not

[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.080]
Or here's a poll suggestion, it says if QM had a...

[00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.740]
Oh, this is cute

[00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:29.240]
Held a competitive eating contest among the staff and tell who would you bet on to win

[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.800]
The beast, the Humper, it says prohibitive favorite

[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.260]
Kim Bo camper, Neo, George Rodriguez, the Dark Horse or Chris

[00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:38.700]
I tell you I was the Dark Horse

[00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:42.360]
I always tell you were kind of like pasty and very wife but I answer you the Dark Horse

[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.540]
I guess they ain't never seen you

[00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:45.740]
No, they would see my ass

[00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:48.700]
That's a pretty weak but we might go with that

[00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:50.740]
Raymond Burr was Canadian

[00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:52.660]
Alright, whatever

[00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:53.800]
I mean I knew he was Canadian

[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:54.680]
But I know he was Canadian

[00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:55.640]
But no he was Canadian

[00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:58.600]
I did not know he was dead

[00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:00.760]
Poor Moe man

[00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:04.260]
I think we injured his life once he found out that Raymond Burr was gay

[00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.920]
Not a guy like that, not a macho guy, not Perry Mason, not the iron side

[00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:10.220]
He used to macho to be gay

[00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:14.320]
But he just after that he was never the same again

[00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:17.220]
Here's the poll from yesterday that George had

[00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:21.560]
591 votes, we already have 685

[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:22.240]
Yeah already

[00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:24.520]
Then, then, then, then, then, then

[00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:26.840]
Of course I started this poll on 6 o'clock last time

[00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:30.340]
Hey, let's not try to like show off

[00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:32.580]
We are the poll experts, it's about all we got going anymore

[00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:34.220]
And to show us what Tom Jicke says

[00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:37.520]
Now that I should hang it up so Greg Badella can come in and take my job

[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.480]
Hey Greg, the audience just spices you

[00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:42.920]
Whether you're in Alabama, whether without a banjo on your names

[00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:47.200]
Pretty obvious from reading that answer there that Tommy's been in contact with Greg Badella

[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:48.080]
He called him up I guess

[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:52.300]
He still, you know, he still fantasizes that he's a talk show host

[00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:55.080]
Just like a footy, how's his talk show coming by the way?

[00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:56.660]
Oh, I guess what?

[00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:58.260]
Mancow's still got a, in the book

[00:06:58.260 --> 00:06:58.680]
Per

[00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:01.660]
I'm sure impressed by that, even with all those billboards

[00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:03.520]
He's still got a point something

[00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:03.720]
Oh!

[00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:06.640]
Here's the poll from yesterday, George asked

[00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:08.300]
What should be come of the N-word?

[00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:11.000]
Now that's not because they were all doing this so we're going to bury the N-word

[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.100]
Very because of the funeral, that's right, the funeral for a friend

[00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:14.640]
That is the funeral for the N-word

[00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:17.260]
How about a funeral for the people who had the funerals when I say?

[00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:19.660]
Because what they were really trying to tell us was

[00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:20.260]
I have no life

[00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:23.600]
What should be come of the N-word?

[00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:28.840]
591 votes, it should be okay for anyone to use openly for any reason, 210, that's what I voted

[00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:32.400]
It's a word, baby, I'm all for a really real free speech

[00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:37.800]
Not make-believe free speech, not airzots free speech, not whenever you feel like it, you can say maybe what's on your mind

[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.360]
Free speech, okay?

[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:42.780]
If you want to say the N-word, you go ahead and say it

[00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:44.160]
You say it, not me

[00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:46.620]
Well, that's what I voted for, but never before

[00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:52.660]
I should never be used by anyone for any reason, 1804, that was a very respectable, well I know my seri respectable

[00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:54.400]
Very solid, second

[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:55.880]
Rock solid, that's right

[00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.700]
It should be okay for anyone to use it openly but not as an insult, 107

[00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:03.040]
Well, I don't think that the- I don't even know

[00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:06.900]
I don't know how they're using it because I don't listen to that rap crap

[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:09.740]
But I do like what's your name though, Rihanna

[00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:10.840]
Right

[00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:16.320]
It should only be used when there are no black people around 60, well there are the ones who are using it for Christ's sake

[00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:18.760]
Who voted- what kind of morons voted on that?

[00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:26.540]
In other words, it's okay to say it, but just behind their back, like if bow camper is used to see-word, you know, if it's like said, cool or something like that

[00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:30.520]
And it should only be used by black people and guess how many said that?

[00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:31.400]
About third man

[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:37.500]
In other words, you can say it, like faggot, you know, it's okay for faggot to say that, like me, you faggot

[00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:39.360]
But if straight people say that's bad

[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:39.960]
You fag

[00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:42.640]
Speak

[00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:44.820]
What a giveaway

[00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:45.600]
Yeah

[00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:49.180]
Anyway, here's today's poll results so far

[00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:52.600]
Oh, well they're all whipped up about this little plane crash in Orlando

[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:56.860]
There are three people injured and two people- was anybody dead or I didn't see that thing

[00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:58.920]
I would assume so

[00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:03.040]
Couple of houses and they're all whipped up about that in Sanford, no less

[00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:08.380]
Sanford is where they used to have the racetrack, harness track, and then there was that castleberry

[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:09.640]
I get confused

[00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:13.200]
Do you know the difference? I think it was castleberry

[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:14.980]
And then they had the dog track there

[00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:17.760]
I don't think they got it no more when Sanford, up by Orlando

[00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:23.460]
Small plane crashed and there are like two houses just- the interesting part of it is the one house is like burned to the ground

[00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:24.380]
They're putting out the fire

[00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:29.980]
And the house next to it, it didn't even have like a scratch on it

[00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:31.060]
When that piss you off

[00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:34.360]
If your house like that smashed into by a plane

[00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:37.620]
Aircraft and then caught on fire and burned to the ground

[00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:40.500]
And your next door neighbor's house is clean and pristine

[00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:43.640]
That must have been the house with not adequate insurance

[00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:45.080]
Oh is that it?

[00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:46.600]
Yeah, that's how they do it

[00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:48.300]
It probably a set up deal

[00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:51.140]
705 votes already on today's poll

[00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:53.420]
It's not a bad poll, who's as a Charlie B again?

[00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:54.720]
It's another Charlie B poll

[00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:58.200]
Hey Charlie your polls are fine but quit sending me stupid emails on my space

[00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:00.620]
Oh he sent me something, I forget what it was about

[00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:01.480]
Oh it was about Hank

[00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:06.360]
It was a gratuitous shot at the Humper for eating again

[00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:08.480]
You know and how we got all ballooned up like that

[00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:10.520]
And got up to 800 pounds, stuff like that

[00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:12.140]
That's bad Charlie B, okay?

[00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:14.320]
Quit picking on the Humper, my good close buddy

[00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:17.140]
You see on today what's on the schedule of it before we do the poll?

[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.080]
Mad Dog at two, yes he is on

[00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:23.640]
The power hour, time to take a shower naked with Mad Dog and a Humper 4 to 5

[00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:25.140]
What a thought that is

[00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:30.000]
Hank from 5 to 7 then we got Dolphins, Miami Dolphins all accessed from 7 to 8

[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.440]
It's abbreviated because we got the Major League Baseball All-Star game

[00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:35.420]
And it declined tonight, any entries in that?

[00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:37.780]
No, well I'll be watching, listening, paying any attention?

[00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:38.480]
Who cares?

[00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:40.740]
And we had the Home Run Derby last night, wow

[00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:44.540]
I mean there's the Kentucky Derby but there's the Home Run Derby

[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:46.400]
That's really important stuff

[00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:49.220]
Here's the poll, now that Bob Barker and Rick Shaw are retired

[00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:52.940]
What other old Cooot or Brock has legend that

[00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:55.280]
they should seriously considering Hank, hang me up

[00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:58.200]
Larry King is kickin' ass

[00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:01.560]
By the way I'm only gonna read the ages this one time, Larry is 73

[00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:04.520]
209 votes, he's got more than twice anybody else

[00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:07.020]
Andy Rooney, who's 88, 102

[00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:10.140]
Paul Harvey also 88, 100, good day

[00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:14.280]
Barbara Wall-Wall she's 77 and she's got 72 votes

[00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:17.940]
Regis is got 75, he's a 75, he's only got 54 votes

[00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:20.300]
See if I give the age out and the numbers it's confusing

[00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:23.780]
The Humper edge ahead of me, I was leading him up until now

[00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:27.880]
Hank is 60, 70's got 45 votes, I'm not 64, I got 42 votes

[00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:30.440]
And Chris is really pissed off about that

[00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:32.820]
Don't you dare hang it up, I need the job

[00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:33.420]
Exactly

[00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:37.280]
G Gordon Lydia is 76 years old, 37 votes

[00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:39.920]
Roger Ebert is 65, he's not looking too good these days

[00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:43.560]
15 votes, keep Jackson 78, 14 votes

[00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:46.380]
I thought he did retire, Chris, whatever your name is

[00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:49.560]
I think he retired, then he came back, so I don't know what he was

[00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:52.400]
He came back, he was like only doing West Coast games and stuff

[00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:53.680]
Oh no, no matter what

[00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:58.820]
Oh, Nelly, John McLaughlin, 80, that's his age, he's got 10 votes

[00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:01.120]
And morally safer, 75 years old, he's only got

[00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:03.340]
Solamente Cinco, Soltafe Cinque

[00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:06.400]
Out of 717, we got the 1000 looked easy today

[00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:09.920]
And you want to know why that's Chris, I'm back today

[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.360]
I got a six day winning streak in Woodvine, how do you like that?

[00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:18.620]
A ride is right, it's a miracle baby, it's a major miracle

[00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:22.160]
They'll never happen again, they said it couldn't be done

[00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:25.480]
1013 at 560 WQI-M

[00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:28.280]
The U-GAH!

[00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:32.620]
Coming up next on RU Smarter than a fifth-rateer

[00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:36.660]
I always been religious, I went to Catholic schools, child

[00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:40.140]
And I've always had a sense of spirituality

[00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:42.800]
But even more so now after being in jail

[00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:44.240]
Did you read the Bible in jail?

[00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:46.660]
Yes, so we did every day

[00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:47.420]
Yes

[00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:49.960]
What's your favorite Bible passage?

[00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:52.540]
Um...

[00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:59.640]
I have no idea I'm just a little familiar with it

[00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:03.640]
I am so sorry, not smarter than a fifth-rateer

[00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:12.780]
It's 1018, number of the box of Asavas, 1018 at 560 WQI-M

[00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:16.100]
We got 737 votes on it, pull me or off to the races baby

[00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:19.020]
Chris assures me that it will make the thousandth rils

[00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:23.180]
He's gonna walk right off the door to a fucking never return

[00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:28.220]
Senator David Vitter, oh pardon me

[00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:35.780]
Republican of Louisiana apologized last night for a very serious sins in his past

[00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:41.100]
After his telephone number appeared among those associated with an escort service operated by the so-called DC Madam

[00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:44.140]
Oh my goodness, he had fire in his pantaloonies I guess

[00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:50.260]
Vitter spokesman Joel DeGrado confirmed the statement and emailed sent to the A&P

[00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:52.840]
Now what do you prefer, the A&P or law laws?

[00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:54.100]
Neither?

[00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:57.700]
This one, you never shop at law laws, it's a pretty damn good stir

[00:13:57.700 --> 00:14:01.020]
Although I've never shopped at the ones here, they have them here, would you believe that?

[00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:02.640]
Huh, I shopped at A&P

[00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:03.980]
Have you really?

[00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:04.380]
Where?

[00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:05.680]
In the Northwest

[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.640]
They have A&P in the Northwest?

[00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:10.040]
I've only used to haven't been there in a while

[00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:12.500]
While there's nothing like stopping in the A&P

[00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:18.000]
This was a very serious sin in my past which I'm of course completely responsible Vitter said the statement

[00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:25.680]
He was doing, he was dittle dallying, he was doing, another one of these Republican, oh it's just, whatever they are

[00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:31.420]
Several years ago I asked for him received forgiveness from God and my wife and confession and marriage counseling

[00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:35.920]
Out of respect for my family, I'll keep my discussion on the matter there with God and them

[00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:41.500]
But I certainly offer my deepened sincere apologies to all I've disappointed let down in any way

[00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:46.020]
Said the right wing, phony baloney hypocrite, full crap senator

[00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:53.000]
The statement containing Vitter's apology said his telephone number was on old phone records of Pamela Martinez associates before he ran for the Senate

[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.000]
He was diddlin

[00:14:54.840 --> 00:15:01.660]
Debra Jean, Palfrey was accused in federal court of racketeering by running a prostitution ring, they needed more than 2 million over 13 years

[00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:02.580]
That's not very much

[00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:08.740]
2 million over 13 years, what's the deal with that even George makes in 13 years before that

[00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:15.320]
Beginning in 1993 she contends however that a rescuer at service Pamela Martinez associates was able to legitimate business

[00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:20.000]
Vitter 46, a Republican in his first Senate term was elected to the Senate in 2004

[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.620]
He represented Louisiana's first congressional district in the house from 1999 to 2004

[00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:28.120]
He and his wife Wendy lived in materiel Louisiana with their four children

[00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:31.020]
They got four kids when he must be doing something at home too

[00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:33.920]
He's doing it on the outside, well this is before he, I don't know

[00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:38.180]
He's doing it, he's doing the old salami slide is what he's doing

[00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:43.880]
And not necessarily always with his wife, you know, whoever's around at the time, whoever's available, what's wrong with that

[00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:45.180]
Nothing

[00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:50.120]
Speaking of section perversion and stuff that we really enjoy and who the hell doesn't

[00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:55.400]
So whether that be our homophobic morning show yesterday had the anxious right wing born again

[00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:59.440]
Bible thumping homophobic lunatic mayor for a lot of the gym nogal on as a guest

[00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:03.940]
Because I heard the Miss Boat camper promoting Atlanta Thursday morning

[00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:06.900]
And of course you know what Boat campers is?

[00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:11.720]
Well you know it's really a shame every time you take your kid or your nephew with a public restroom

[00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:14.280]
There's two guys and they're doing stuff, you know

[00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:20.960]
And I keep asking everybody I know if they've ever encountered that and I have yet to encounter anybody besides Miss Boat camper

[00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:24.940]
Who's encountered that? I'm not saying that it doesn't happen but I just have never...

[00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:25.880]
No I'm as fortunate.

[00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:31.800]
Heard of it, as a matter of fact we're only recently have I heard of it when that you know the Channel 10 story came out and we started talking about it

[00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:32.700]
I was oblivious

[00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:34.260]
You were oblivious?

[00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:34.600]
Yeah

[00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:35.380]
I've never...

[00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:37.120]
For guys who are dittling in another tea room

[00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:38.640]
You know what?

[00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:43.740]
That never would have occurred to me because of all the unsexy places I can think of that's top of the list

[00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:47.060]
Now you guys have never been to JC Penney's in Westland?

[00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:47.920]
No, Alia

[00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:48.300]
No

[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:49.580]
Can't say that

[00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:54.420]
There, they're doing the Alimbo Rock there is what we've been hearing from you guys and of course we use those things

[00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:58.500]
Listen, you know what, when you see guys doing the Alimbo Rock in the tea room you know what they're doing

[00:16:58.500 --> 00:16:59.800]
You're looking for the glory hole

[00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:00.260]
That's right

[00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:03.820]
And that's JC Penney's in Westland

[00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:07.700]
Well that's high Alia, you know it's your people they tend to be a little bit on the thorny side

[00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:08.100]
Okay

[00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:16.400]
Mayor Jim Nogel may be getting a lot more paperwork says the Sun Central gay rights activists in the state have launched a drug when Gothafor Lauderdale Mayor

[00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:20.500]
With toilet paper to mock his comments about gay sex and public bathrooms

[00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:26.660]
Only the morning show on the station would dignify his idiocy by actually giving him a form on which to spew his lunacy

[00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:30.620]
And that's cause Kim Boke camper is in full homophob mode now

[00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:33.820]
I would be surprised if we have a remake of a bear ass mounting

[00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:38.140]
During Kim Boke camper in one of his former teammates I'm not really sure which one

[00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:40.300]
Maybe AG doing would be good I liked him

[00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:46.380]
Mm-hmm

[00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:50.760]
I just launched this drive where encouraging people to mail either a rule or several sheets of toilet paper to the mayor

[00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:54.520]
And City Hall to help him wipe his dirty mind clean said Ryan Winfield

[00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:59.780]
Supposed for a quality floor to gay rights organization that helps start the toilet paper protest on Friday

[00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:10.500]
The uproar started after Nogel's comments in age of life, orthotical in the Sun Central about the city's planned to buy a $250,000 self-cleaning robotic toilet for beach goers

[00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:14.480]
The device could be programmed with a time limit after which the door would fly open

[00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:19.820]
Well what if you got like the screaming green apple quickstep or something like that

[00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:22.780]
I mean you might be in there for a while you don't want the door to be flat and open

[00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:25.900]
Right and nobody else who's around sure so wants it either

[00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:26.760]
Right

[00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:32.760]
In the article Nogel was quoted as saying the toilet confirmed homosexual activity that has occurred in other public restrooms

[00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:36.920]
Sometimes public restrooms are used for sexual activity

[00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:41.360]
Most of it's men meeting men because it's same sex people in the bathrooms Nogel said

[00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:42.920]
Most of it

[00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:47.060]
No, maybe not maybe there's a woman in there too maybe there's guys and gals and kids

[00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:49.000]
I've never seen that in dogs and goats

[00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:52.000]
Maybe old goats like Boat Campers

[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.440]
Equality Florida has provided a link on its website to send Nogel a virtual role of toilet paper

[00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:59.560]
And listed as City Hall address for those who want to send a real role

[00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:03.140]
Nogel said no actual toilet paper rolls have arrived at his office

[00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:06.800]
However more than 300 people have emailed the mayor a virtual rule when feel said

[00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:10.960]
It's an email some juvenile diagram of a toilet Nogel said

[00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:18.500]
Last year police made one arrest for such activity in a in a beach bathroom and another with a Crowbridge mall

[00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:23.200]
Not that that couldn't be near the Crowbridge Presbyterian Church in the DJM's Kennedy couldn't

[00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:25.720]
Because the Lord's gonna be really parked off about that

[00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:31.420]
They made one arrest at such activity in a beach bathroom and another one with a Crowbridge mall

[00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:33.920]
So that sounds like two to me I could be wrong about that

[00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:39.540]
But that sounds like Uno and Uno sounds like DOS to me isn't let's get a dose of reality here

[00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:44.900]
Like there's an epidemic of this stuff going on not only in Kimbo campers mind and Jim Nogel's mind

[00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:48.680]
Ever see the two of them together?

[00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:50.140]
No, nothing, you mentioned it

[00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:53.660]
757 I have flown on those

[00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:59.580]
Or I do like that new a 787 by the way you see that that's a let's say sleek machine mod

[00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:00.780]
The 787 thing

[00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:01.400]
No, I ain't fling it

[00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:03.140]
Oh that's right you ain't gonna fly it anyway, you know

[00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:05.000]
That's right I don't have any money I can't go no more

[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.100]
Well come on let's take up a collection for George. He's whining and about he ain't got no money

[00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:11.760]
And his wife is a bitch and you know

[00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:14.560]
He's got that one kid he didn't want in the first place

[00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:17.300]
And we commiserate with you wholeheartedly

[00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:21.140]
The other way is Hank Guerrero still working there is it just a figment of my man's favorite

[00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:23.060]
He's still there

[00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:23.060]

[00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:23.800]
He's still there

[00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:25.340]
One more I only say that you know

[00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:31.280]
Tongue in your cheek because it just he just has nothing to do with this spot

[00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:32.940]
But it's just another one coming later on

[00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:36.940]
He just a copy ate him man he learned very well probably time direct taught him

[00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:39.740]
Oh don't worry about that roger's about that fat faggot

[00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:42.780]
We don't do copy here okay that's not the our uh yeah

[00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:44.320]
It's not an our thing

[00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:48.100]
Do you know what I'm saying?

[00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:48.680]
What do you say?

[00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:50.120]
Do you ever see him Hank Guerrero?

[00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:51.120]
Yeah I see him in the hole

[00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:53.000]
Tell Tommy's an A hole next time you see him

[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.040]
Give him a message for me

[00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:54.340]
Yeah

[00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:56.000]
Tell Neil says you're an A hole

[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000]
Not worth it not worth the effort

[00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.260]
A pindaho

[00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:02.960]
I thought it was pindaho

[00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:04.120]
Is it really?

[00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:05.540]
Well that's how we say it

[00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:07.280]
No in Mexican it's pindaho

[00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:08.320]
I don't know

[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:08.880]
That's what I said

[00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:11.340]
I didn't want to say it the right way because they say pindaho

[00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:14.040]
If you say it the wrong way then it's not the word it's like Schmidt you know

[00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:15.300]
Right it's pindaho

[00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:17.420]
What did I say?

[00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:18.120]
Pindaho

[00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:19.040]
Oh good

[00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:22.200]
See you do the dirty words I'll just make up ones that don't exist

[00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:23.140]
Nothing dirty about it

[00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:23.840]
Then I'll be saved

[00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:25.100]
Well that all depends on

[00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:27.680]
How much does that toilet paper from from Jim Noggle?

[00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:29.580]
You're keeping and how much you're sending out

[00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:31.600]
Went in doubt since him out

[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:34.400]
In fact I'm thinking of maybe using something and sending it to the mayor

[00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:37.000]
That sounds like a really good way to make it

[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.060]
Remember those tests that they were...

[00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:42.860]
Those rectal tests that they had that was many years ago

[00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:44.000]
Channel 4 did the thing

[00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:46.000]
And their intentions were good

[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.620]
They were trying to help people die

[00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:51.040]
You know catch colorectal cancer very early

[00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:53.600]
And so they had these kits that they sent

[00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:56.620]
You when you had like to push me a little something there on a...

[00:21:56.620 --> 00:21:57.460]
And then put it in the mail

[00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:58.740]
And an envelope

[00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:01.500]
And the postman were swooning

[00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:03.420]
That was the word I'll never forget as long as I would

[00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:05.120]
There was the actual word in the newspaper article

[00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:07.640]
And they heard there were postman swooning

[00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:12.120]
They were going into a coma from the aroma of the envelopes

[00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:13.120]
Is that bad or what?

[00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:13.520]
No

[00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:14.540]
Not good

[00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:17.160]
27 past 10

[00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:20.060]
I know it's sound strange, two strange to be true

[00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:21.260]
But it's a soft Florida thing

[00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:21.580]
You know

[00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:23.880]
Let's put some crap on some paper

[00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:26.640]
And let's send it to the mail in Jim Noggle, okay?

[00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:29.100]
That should do it

[00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:35.240]
You fare

[00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:00.260]
I want it

[00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:02.800]
Because it's a real wazer

[00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:04.860]
It has its own web browser

[00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:08.420]
Along with Wi-Fi email and I've gone

[00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:13.420]
I'll check out every Apple store from LA today on

[00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:16.540]
Because I need this sucker like my dog

[00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:17.740]
He needs his phone

[00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:19.320]
Look, that's where I've been

[00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:21.740]
He needs the iPhone

[00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:23.860]
And hello, I'm your buddy

[00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:23.860]

[00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:23.860]

[00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:23.860]

[00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:24.460]
I'm the iPhone

[00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:25.200]
Yeah, we're out

[00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:26.600]
We're sold out

[00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:28.520]
Yeah, can't be sold out these days when I'm sale

[00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:29.880]
No, you can have one in a few months

[00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:32.060]
I feel like there's too much in my day and I want now

[00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:33.900]
No, it's not gonna happen

[00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:35.280]
I need that as the iPhone

[00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:36.720]
No, you gotta wait

[00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:37.940]
No, I can't wait

[00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:38.940]
I'll put you on the list

[00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:39.260]
Oh

[00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:41.660]
It will be a living hell

[00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:44.940]
If I have to keep my stupid best health

[00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:46.920]
The God I love that color screen

[00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:49.260]
Service light is always green

[00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:51.680]
Coolest thing I've ever seen

[00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:55.120]
Oh, I need the iPhone

[00:23:55.980 --> 00:23:57.920]
I can't live this alone

[00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:00.100]
I'll build new inspection mode

[00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:02.280]
Until they can see iPhone

[00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:04.760]
I can't get around, I need the iPhone

[00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:05.640]
Get out of the store

[00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:06.380]
What do you think it is?

[00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:07.500]
Get out of the store?

[00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:07.980]
I get out of the store

[00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:09.320]
So you guys are iPhone yet or what?

[00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:09.660]
No

[00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:11.320]
Chris?

[00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:12.620]
No

[00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:13.220]
Yeah, we're right

[00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:14.700]
What about what is it?

[00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:15.420]
What is it?

[00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:16.400]
You can't afford it

[00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:17.160]
Is that what you're trying to say?

[00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:18.240]
You crying four months again?

[00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:20.160]
The audience is gonna start getting real tired of that crap

[00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:21.000]
Real soon

[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:21.780]
I'd like you to be here

[00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:23.960]
Unless what?

[00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:25.660]
I'd let you do that for me

[00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:26.500]
Do what?

[00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:27.400]
Crying four

[00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:30.520]
781 votes on a poll today

[00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:33.060]
We got a nice poll going thanks to our good close friend Charlie B

[00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:34.940]
Who I wish would stop sending me stupid emails

[00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:36.900]
But nevertheless, keep the polls coming Charlie

[00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:37.700]
Cut out the email

[00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:40.360]
And by the way, L. Rogers, if you ever send me another email

[00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:42.660]
I'm gonna send the Randy Rhodes to your stock

[00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:43.480]
You're stupid ass

[00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:44.800]
That was a stunning news there

[00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:45.560]
Wasn't that amazing?

[00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:47.600]
I mean, out of sight out of mind

[00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:49.500]
So when I first saw him on there

[00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:52.240]
Many days ago on our Myspace

[00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:54.800]
By the way, we have 14, 17, and 70 Myspace friends

[00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:55.660]
Pretty impressive

[00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:58.400]
A Benjamin Gel will be proud of that if he wouldn't have gotten the screw in the fire

[00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:00.700]
Oh, and speaking of that

[00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:01.240]
Hmm?

[00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:05.540]
How did you tell the story or did this happen last night about his replacement?

[00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:06.960]
Nothing all from him

[00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:08.700]
Nothing happened and it had nothing to do with that guy

[00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:09.760]
And it did with some other guy

[00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:12.660]
The thing that didn't happen

[00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:21.740]
Like I told you the story

[00:25:21.740 --> 00:25:26.100]
Just made sure that you get it right before you tell this story about this thing that didn't happen

[00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:27.360]
It didn't happen

[00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:29.940]
Yeah, it did happen but we didn't hear it from anybody

[00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:31.180]
Except for Chris

[00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:34.760]
Oh Chris was telling us about it before the show this morning

[00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:35.360]
Because he was there

[00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:36.980]
Because I'd draw by and saw it

[00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:38.620]
Well, you can tell it on the year in a minute

[00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:39.520]
Do I have to?

[00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:40.140]
No

[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.540]
But the new guy certainly hasn't distinguished himself to say the very least

[00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:46.920]
He got the station Hummer toad

[00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:48.460]
Well, it wasn't him, it was some other guy

[00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:49.640]
Or is it...

[00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:51.080]
Why do you say that now?

[00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:53.520]
No, no, that's what I said then

[00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:55.780]
And you know, you're gonna change it

[00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:56.960]
It was some other guy?

[00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:59.240]
It was another guy in the promotions department

[00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:01.380]
Some $5 an hour flunky or something

[00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:03.340]
I thought you said it was the new guy

[00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:04.600]
That's what Chris said

[00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:05.180]
No

[00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:06.920]
No one said that

[00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:08.540]
Oh, well, it was a real one morning

[00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:12.700]
Well, I don't want to listen to any more of you speaking Spanish

[00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:13.700]
I'm never gonna do that again

[00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:17.120]
Now that Bob Barker and Rick Shaw hung it up

[00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:20.400]
What other old coupe broadcast old coach had hung it up?

[00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:24.300]
7803 votes Larry King is kicking another competition's ass

[00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:26.380]
222, 232

[00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:28.880]
232, he's way out there on his own

[00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:30.180]
As he should be

[00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:31.700]
Andy Rooney, 117

[00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:37.200]
What the hell was that? Did you hear that?

[00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:38.740]
I heard something, I thought it was from here

[00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:40.060]
No, it was a truck horn

[00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:40.880]
It was a horn sound

[00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:42.260]
Yeah, I thought it was a truck horn

[00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:46.200]
I thought it was a truck horn

[00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:46.200]

[00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:46.200]

[00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:46.200]

[00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:47.900]
I thought it was a truck horn

[00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:47.920]
I thought it was a truck horn

[00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:49.800]
I thought it was a truck horn

[00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:50.220]
I thought it was a truck horn

[00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:50.620]
I thought it was a truck horn

[00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:50.900]
I thought it was a truck horn

[00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:53.000]
I thought it was a truck horn

[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:56.760]
I thought it was a truck horn

[00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:57.480]
I thought it was a truck horn

[00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:58.140]
I thought it was a truck horn

[00:26:58.140 --> 00:26:59.160]
I thought it was a truck horn

[00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:00.360]
I thought it was a truck horn

[00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:02.720]
I thought it was a truck horn

[00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:03.960]
I thought it was a truck horn

[00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:05.060]
I thought it was a truck horn

[00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:05.400]
I thought it was a truck horn

[00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:06.580]
I thought it was a truck horn

[00:27:06.580 --> 00:27:08.300]
I thought it was a truck horn

[00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:09.620]
I thought it was a truck horn

[00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:12.240]
I thought it was a truck horn

[00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:13.800]
He realizes, uh, enough already

[00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:15.440]
He's got an ego, it's just too big

[00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:17.300]
Hank Goldberg speaking of big

[00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:19.260]
The Humphers got 51, I got 44

[00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:21.060]
He's a drawn away from me

[00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:23.120]
I can't keep up with him

[00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:25.860]
Gordon Litty 40, Roger Ebert 16

[00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:27.360]
He shouldn't be on this list

[00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:29.600]
That's in bad taste, uh, Charlie B

[00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:31.580]
He had a bad stroke or something

[00:27:31.580 --> 00:27:36.400]
He's like all this figured and like, uh, he's like a vegetable for Christ's

[00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:37.980]
Should he be on there?

[00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:39.160]
Why not?

[00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:41.060]
Because it's bad

[00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:43.580]
We don't care about, he's not, uh, anyway

[00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:44.780]
He's older than you

[00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:47.220]
So is everybody else on his list?

[00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:48.740]
Well then, he should be on there if you're on there

[00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:51.880]
He's Jackson's God 16, John McLaughlin 13

[00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:53.600]
Bye-bye, that's John McLaughlin

[00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:56.320]
Nobody knows who that is except people that watch you, that one show

[00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:56.900]
What's the show called?

[00:27:57.180 --> 00:27:59.440]
I'll show you that bit, uh, the uh, the uh, McLaughlin report

[00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:02.280]
Bye-bye, I love that bit, I love that show

[00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:04.460]
Uh, and more or less say for five

[00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:07.040]
They got that Tony Blankley, that fat, right wing Brit

[00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:10.300]
How come every Brit that they were put on these talking head shows

[00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:16.120]
Is always some right wing idiot, some sour, some jackass, some fat pig like a Tony Blankley

[00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:17.680]
Well where did they find these people?

[00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:23.780]
793, the one to pull, we got a thousand licked out and I didn't even have to get all whipped up and exercised about that

[00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:26.200]
Thank God for that because Jews don't like exercise

[00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:30.940]
I guess you were pretty shocked that they have fired this guy out to Hurricane Center, right?

[00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:32.180]
Not, nope

[00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:38.300]
I mean, they did everything except takeout billboards, you know, this guy should have been cleaning out his desk days ago

[00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:48.380]
National Hurricane Center director Bill Prenz, it was placed on indefinitely yesterday by superiors who said his brief turbulent reign threatened the Hurricane Center's ability to protect the American people

[00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:52.400]
And one thing we don't want to the Hurricane Center is turbulent reign brief or otherwise

[00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:53.680]
Am I right about that?

[00:28:53.900 --> 00:28:54.000]
Right

[00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:55.740]
Turbulent reign is bad

[00:28:56.300 --> 00:29:02.860]
The action came amid an unprecedented unseen immunity that looked for ends without significant support from his employees in South Florida or his bosses in Washington

[00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:07.620]
His tenure with the center lasted only six months and was cut so short it didn't include a single hurricane

[00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:09.840]
Well he's got that, that's a feather in his cap

[00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:12.640]
During his reign there was not one hurricane

[00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:15.120]
Nice going there, what a bill, Billy Boy

[00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:24.600]
In the email to the center staff, no administrator, Conrad C. Loughten-Bacher, Jr. named Ed Rappaport, the center's hired regarded deputy director since 2000's acting director

[00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:29.760]
You've seen him, he's good on TV all the time, during the hurricane, he's a pretty boring guy

[00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:30.260]
He's alright

[00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:36.760]
Loughten-Bacher said that he heard enough from a team of inspectors he sent to the center last week to conduct a snap inspection

[00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:42.060]
Oh there's nothing worse than when they snap it and they inspect it or maybe you're clapping at their inspecting it

[00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:53.940]
In his email Loughten-Bacher said he took the action in response to the inspection team's concern that as expressed by many of you, there currently exists a level of anxiety and disruption that threatens the center's ability to perform its mission to protect the American people

[00:29:53.940 --> 00:29:56.680]
Well that sounds very reassuring by the way

[00:29:56.680 --> 00:30:03.700]
Though Prenzus' future status remains unclear, Loughten-Bacher didn't mince any words because if he minced any words I would have played

[00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:05.240]
You're fairing

[00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:12.120]
He said Prenz will be on leave until for the notice which means that he will not be able to take any official duties or performing any function in your chain of command

[00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:14.920]
Prenzus didn't return immediately calls, he's out

[00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:17.740]
Clean out your desk and get lost, Billy Boy, you're done

[00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:20.340]
A turbulent rain

[00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:23.220]
You ever fly through a turbulent rain I guess not

[00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:24.760]
I might have a regret on the flying

[00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:26.760]
The next boat's going to be used to be 800 by the way

[00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:27.640]
Used to what? Fly

[00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:30.180]
And you flew through a turbulent rain? I must have

[00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:31.960]
Two bad storms under the rain

[00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:33.000]
And shaking and quaking

[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:33.360]
That's right

[00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:38.320]
That's one time a flight would land and I have no idea what I guess was a reconnecting flight

[00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:44.320]
Through some of those absolute worst, I mean just horrible and you think the plane is shaking

[00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:46.520]
Oh don't worry about that, no problem at all

[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:51.580]
Like I told you that the pilot on KLM, that real crazy Dutch guy on a way back here from Amsterdam, his last trip

[00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:58.620]
He says, oh well I just want you to all to know that I have a wife and children too so I'm just concerned about landing safely as you are

[00:30:58.620 --> 00:31:00.560]
You know, I'll still believe

[00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:03.580]
Nothing funnier than an old Dutchman

[00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:05.380]
Now

[00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:08.620]
Fuck it in and hold it

[00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:11.580]
Hello, this is Vice President Dick Cheney

[00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:14.420]
Ordering you to forget about the iPhone

[00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:17.620]
That was built by latte drinking liberals

[00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:22.060]
Instead do like I do, use the F-phone

[00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:27.180]
The F-phone was developed by conservatives and it does everything I needed to

[00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:33.260]
I can get news headlines, stock reports and I can receive instant messages from my bosses at Hatter Burton

[00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:36.820]
Investive all the F-phone regulates my pacemaker

[00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:38.920]
Here, let me show you how it works

[00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:40.880]
What the fuck?

[00:31:41.780 --> 00:31:43.620]
What's wrong with this fucking...

[00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:45.060]
What the fuck?

[00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:45.300]
Me?

[00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:49.760]
There's somebody show me how the fuck to work this fucking thing

[00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:53.400]
Hey, where do they call it the F-phone anyway?

[00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:54.800]
Oh fuck

[00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:57.100]
Hey man, well I have a few too

[00:31:57.100 --> 00:32:00.060]
It's 1046, 14 before 11 at 560 WQM

[00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:01.920]
Happy Tuesday to you baby

[00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:03.740]
It's right here in the middle of it, Julio

[00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:08.000]
Whatever that means, I don't know, it's like a dog days in it

[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.280]
Sure is

[00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:12.380]
Opposition of the Iraq Wars reached a record high

[00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:17.600]
This is a brand new USA Today Gallup Pull just off the press only seconds ago, at least my press

[00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:24.300]
A development likely to complicate President Bush's efforts to hold together Republican support as the Senate begins to debate this week

[00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:28.620]
I'm Pentagon priorities, we got a new deal in Iraq, some new dead people

[00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:33.860]
And Bush's approval rating in this pool has reached a new low 29%

[00:32:33.860 --> 00:32:36.360]
Not to be confused with the 27% of the other pools

[00:32:37.420 --> 00:32:40.380]
In the survey taken over this past weekend, Friday through Sunday

[00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:45.320]
One in five Americans say the increase in US forces in Iraq since January has made the situation there better

[00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:49.760]
Half state has made a difference and the rest of them say, Iraq, what's that?

[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.560]
What's that kind of do with Paris Hilton's ass?

[00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:56.780]
More than 7 and 10, we have a favor removing nearly all US troops from Iraq by April

[00:32:56.780 --> 00:32:59.300]
Why nearly all? Okay, what do we got to leave?

[00:32:59.380 --> 00:33:02.720]
A few poor slumpers behind, oh bad news, you're the 100 that were leaving behind

[00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:10.360]
55% say Congress should wait to develop a new policy on Iraq until General David Patrase commander of the US forces that are in the state of Iraq

[00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:14.860]
The Liberse promised assessment in September 40% say Congress should act now

[00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:18.760]
The American public, the dumber than sawdust, man, dumber than dirt

[00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:22.260]
A little slow to catch on, a little slow on the uptake

[00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:31.340]
Bush's support is eroding among Republicans, 68% approve them down from an average of 92% this first term

[00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:35.700]
82% in the second term, nearly 4 out of 10 Republicans say the immigration debate

[00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:40.700]
which ended in the feet for Bush's overhaul proposal caused them to lose confidence in the Bushmeister

[00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:45.880]
in this butcher, in this lunatic, in this demented maniac with all his blood on his hands

[00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:49.900]
62% say the US made a mistake in sending troops to Iraq

[00:33:49.900 --> 00:33:52.480]
The first time ever that number is top 60%

[00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:57.920]
Because there's about 30% of the American public as IQ is smaller than their digit

[00:33:58.500 --> 00:34:02.460]
2-3, it's a Bush shouldn't have intervened in the case of a scooter Libby

[00:34:02.460 --> 00:34:05.500]
6 out of 10 say the economy is worse than the most five years ago

[00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:14.160]
And 62 to 36% those surveys say an impeachment inquiry against Bush promoted by some liberal websites wouldn't be justified

[00:34:15.380 --> 00:34:17.540]
62 to 36 say would not be justified

[00:34:17.540 --> 00:34:20.820]
Nancy Pelosi says Congress has no intention of holding such proceedings

[00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:26.960]
Republicans oppose the idea 91 to 9% Democrats supported 54 to 44%

[00:34:27.580 --> 00:34:29.360]
Got those numbers? You can write them all down?

[00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:29.880]
No

[00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:31.280]
Well, too bad

[00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:36.800]
We had some pretty good numbers last Thursday. Clarence is back from vacation and stuck his ass in the door this morning

[00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:39.440]
Oh nice number is in the trend, you oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:41.980]
And I told him I said sure it's all because of you, Clarence

[00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:48.220]
You idiot, you quizzling, you jacke-ass, you sports nerd, you joc sniffing fool with you

[00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:50.360]
You jocke-looking maniac

[00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:54.040]
You see that's me, and then you like wandered out of there

[00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:58.460]
You have anything to say to you like you ought to talk a lot about more sports when you're on?

[00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:00.240]
No, no nothing like that

[00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:06.460]
Well good, if you ever listen if he ever gives you any more advice on what to do when you're on here I would just kick him in the crotch

[00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:11.600]
Okay, I would just with the heel of your shoe

[00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:13.520]
Well, I would just like I'm kicking a football

[00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:15.820]
That's right, that's a good idea

[00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:20.880]
Pretend you're kicking the extra point, pretend it's 63 year old, like Tom Dempsey

[00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:24.980]
In fact, what I would do is I would put one of those, what do he have on that shoe, Chris, remember?

[00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:27.900]
No, because I wouldn't like that

[00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:32.000]
Well, no, he had some kind of a thing, it was like a half shoe with the flat front

[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:33.680]
Yeah, it was a flat front of shoe

[00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:36.600]
Oh, there's Harry Potterhead on there, any interest?

[00:35:37.180 --> 00:35:41.420]
And the professor tells me that everybody of all ages is in the Harry Potter, am I right about that?

[00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:42.540]
Is he right about it or not?

[00:35:43.180 --> 00:35:44.580]
No, I've heard this for kids

[00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:45.580]
Yes

[00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:49.800]
Well, the professor I think is just a childhood heart, he sends me the chair

[00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:50.760]
Okay, everybody, huh?

[00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:51.380]
And chicks

[00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:52.760]
Chicks?

[00:35:53.220 --> 00:35:54.020]
Oh, no

[00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:59.720]
That's not good for his image, I'll tell you that, 819 votes on the pool, who should hang it up?

[00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:05.040]
Now that Bob Barker, Harry Potter is not for adults, well I could be wrong about that

[00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:06.320]
What do I know?

[00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:07.120]
Would you see it?

[00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:08.580]
Would you take your kids to go see it?

[00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:12.140]
I took my daughter to see the first one, I don't want to see any of the other ones ever again

[00:36:12.820 --> 00:36:13.640]
Oh, no!

[00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:16.220]
I said, you're on your own with these honey

[00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:16.940]
With this graph, huh?

[00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:17.340]
Yeah

[00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:18.360]
I think they sound too promising

[00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:21.540]
Oh, horrible, horrendous

[00:36:21.540 --> 00:36:21.980]
Really?

[00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:28.700]
Oh yeah, the stupidest bunch of crap nonsense, no plot, everything predictable and contrived

[00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:30.060]
Harry, no point ever, it doesn't know

[00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:34.340]
Now let me tell you about a good flick before I get back to the pool, I don't know

[00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:39.920]
Seriously, I saw it on the cable the other day and now I'm reading the reviews and they're ripping the hell out of it which pisses me off

[00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:41.000]
Because I thought it was pretty good

[00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:46.120]
10th and wolf, now I am DB, it's got 6.4, whether that's not a bad number

[00:36:46.820 --> 00:36:47.700]
Am I right?

[00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:49.340]
Huh?

[00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:55.300]
It's a mafia movie that's based on a true story about a mob war in Philadelphia

[00:36:55.300 --> 00:37:03.740]
And it stars James Marzen and believe you me, that's, if for no other reason I loved that him and the movie

[00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:04.900]
What's the name of it again?

[00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:08.060]
10th and wolf, I all of what it

[00:37:08.060 --> 00:37:12.440]
Oh, here's a message from your friend, the professor, Georgia's totally out of touch

[00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:14.140]
Haha, I agree

[00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:16.600]
Who are you?

[00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:17.500]
I love all you want

[00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:24.160]
I've read all 6 of the books, I've read all 6 of the books, they weren't that bad and I saw the movie

[00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:28.720]
You saw the movie where it won't be, I guess it's 3 of them now

[00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:29.260]
All of them?

[00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:30.980]
And you're gonna see the new one?

[00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:31.980]
Yeah, sure, why not?

[00:37:32.260 --> 00:37:34.360]
Yeah, we'll see it's more of a picture of summer, you know

[00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:37.200]
Georgia out of touch, man, you're all like me, you're all like me

[00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:38.600]
Uh-huh, sorry

[00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:45.420]
James Marzen by the way, you're all so hot that he probably once upon a time could have worked at Evercrombian Bitch

[00:37:46.420 --> 00:37:52.560]
Which we were in there again yesterday and I'm gonna tell you something, that store they had a charge you had mission just to walk in the door there

[00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:56.960]
You know, I hate to use that term that you use all the time because to me it's just nauseating

[00:37:56.960 --> 00:38:01.040]
I can't, when you dive headaches, especially lately I'm gonna have my herbivory

[00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:02.780]
Stop lying for once, you heard me say that once

[00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:04.600]
Yeah, you like to use that though

[00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:05.900]
You heard me say it once

[00:38:05.900 --> 00:38:08.040]
As soon as I said I hated that you stopped using it

[00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:10.200]
But you're all to touch anyway, that's right

[00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:11.560]
Yeah, touch this

[00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:16.620]
But hey, I'll tell you that there ought to be a sign saying touch this nevercrombian I would live there, oh my god

[00:38:16.620 --> 00:38:18.040]
Where do those people come from?

[00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:20.120]
Are you trying to say they need one of those new bathrooms there?

[00:38:24.260 --> 00:38:25.260]
Are you gonna stop?

[00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:27.740]
You don't wanna run it up?

[00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:30.480]
That's good, you and Jim are on the Kimbo camper

[00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:33.840]
I wouldn't be surprised if Kimbo camper he looks with Kris before the year is over

[00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:35.240]
Yeah, no thank you

[00:38:35.820 --> 00:38:36.980]
828 votes on the pool

[00:38:37.740 --> 00:38:40.120]
Harry Potter is great man, that's what I'm being told

[00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:44.220]
I think it's for kids and people who have, you know, emotional problems

[00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:45.400]
Now that...

[00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:47.480]
Sorry, I guess you read a lot

[00:38:50.340 --> 00:38:53.960]
I mean, when I was a little kid I read Nancy Drew Mysteries, what does that say?

[00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:55.580]
You know, another word of a party boy?

[00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:56.480]
You were a little kid

[00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:59.980]
You said the hardly boys I read Nancy Drew, because that was a little amaticone

[00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:03.040]
So, at least I've been consistent throughout my life, okay?

[00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:05.300]
I don't pretend to be one thing one day and something else you have to do

[00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:07.640]
I'm just an old fag, okay?

[00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:09.040]
And that's just the way it goes, you don't like it?

[00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:11.880]
Too bad, as Dick Cheney would say, too often bad

[00:39:12.980 --> 00:39:15.200]
Anyway, here's the pool, who should return next?

[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:20.980]
Larry King, 248, he is kicking big serious smelly ass on here

[00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:23.020]
Here's another message, you let's see, what is it?

[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:29.380]
It says the guy James Marzen is gonna be in the hairspray movie

[00:39:29.380 --> 00:39:31.200]
What hairspray movie?

[00:39:31.580 --> 00:39:33.000]
There's a new one with John Travolta and Drag

[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:34.320]
Oh no!

[00:39:34.660 --> 00:39:36.700]
The first one wasn't bad enough so they had to do it again

[00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:42.320]
John V Volta and Drag, well I'm sure you know he probably used his word girl from the house

[00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:42.700]
Uh-huh

[00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:52.100]
Larry King, 248, Andy Rooney 130, Paul Harvey 115, Barbara Walters 82, Regis is about 63

[00:39:52.100 --> 00:39:56.240]
Hang it up, we just year 100 years old, he's 75, he could pass for 90 easy

[00:39:56.240 --> 00:39:59.540]
He said 68 bypass, it's 400 heart attacks

[00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:03.480]
The Humper's got 54, he's edging away from me, I got 45

[00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:09.680]
Hank is 67, is that correct or is that like where did Charlie be get these ages from?

[00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:14.240]
I wonder, I guess he probably looked it up on I on what you call it?

[00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:16.120]
IMDB?

[00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:19.340]
No, not IMDB, the other competing, we're competing

[00:40:19.340 --> 00:40:22.200]
Well I'm a Hankby and IMDB, what movie is he made?

[00:40:24.140 --> 00:40:29.420]
I got 45 votes, 5.3% say time for me to hang it up, I'll tell you what, I'm going to hang it up when I'm ready

[00:40:29.420 --> 00:40:32.880]
Okay when Greg Budella is ready to come in and take over this as he...

[00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:36.220]
I'll never understand that, what is it with the Greg Budella people?

[00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:38.040]
The fall five of them

[00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:43.640]
Yeah, that's exactly correct, he's a state of mind, he is to broadcasting with the rest of the houses to food

[00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:46.380]
Actually, Hank Goldberg is listed on IMDB

[00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:47.620]
Is he?

[00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:48.120]
Yep

[00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:48.880]
For what?

[00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:54.780]
We guide to guys, aka Dave Berry is completely guide to guys on you today

[00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:56.420]
Does it say that Hank is 67?

[00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:59.520]
It says he was born July 4th, 1940

[00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:00.920]
40?

[00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:02.480]
July 4th, 1967

[00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:04.200]
He was born on the 4th of July?

[00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:05.120]
That would be correct

[00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:10.960]
So that makes him 67 as of last week, is of 6 days ago

[00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:11.400]
Correct

[00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:15.180]
So Charlie be got away, quick pick it on Charlie be, he knows his craft

[00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:18.180]
Gordon Litty 41, Roger Ebert 70

[00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:21.260]
I feel so bad, I hate him in the first place, number one

[00:41:21.260 --> 00:41:24.920]
But even hating him, I still, you gotta have a little rock-monis baby

[00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:28.500]
The guy looks like a vegetable, looks like he ought to be in the Heinz bottle

[00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:30.800]
Or can, can it, Roger?

[00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:33.580]
He's got 17 votes, heartless bastards

[00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:38.340]
Keith Jackson's got 17, John McLaughlin, bye bye, he's got 14

[00:41:38.340 --> 00:41:39.980]
And Morley's safe, he's only got five

[00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:42.380]
Is he still on 60 minutes because I don't watch it anymore?

[00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:47.320]
And either of you obviously you don't know, Morley's safe for tick tick tick tick tick tick tick

[00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:50.160]
Yeah, I watched it last week but I didn't notice Morley there

[00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:51.280]
No Morley?

[00:41:51.540 --> 00:41:51.940]
I don't know

[00:41:51.940 --> 00:41:53.420]
No, not no Morley

[00:41:53.420 --> 00:41:53.420]

[00:41:53.420 --> 00:41:55.620]
You know what say for means in the Hebrew?

[00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:56.680]
No

[00:41:57.320 --> 00:41:57.340]
Book

[00:41:57.340 --> 00:42:02.040]
Ha ha, so you can take your Pendejo and Pendajo

[00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:03.680]
No, you stick your tongue on your tongue

[00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:05.240]
I really am embarrassed that I said that

[00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:08.900]
But you've got me so flustered now that you're speaking Spanish with my Mexican roommate here

[00:42:08.900 --> 00:42:12.000]
Well yeah, and you could use some practice with my young Mexican boyfriend

[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:15.400]
It's 841 votes and the poll we get 1,000 and licked easy

[00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:16.380]
You can

[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:19.240]
You can steal my cheers

[00:42:19.240 --> 00:42:20.820]
This is the Neoronshire show

[00:42:25.420 --> 00:42:26.460]
Any questions?

[00:42:27.860 --> 00:42:30.160]
So what's going on in the world of sports today?

[00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:31.200]
Nothing

[00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:33.420]
Oh come on, there's got to be something sports related

[00:42:33.420 --> 00:42:35.400]
We can disinterest our audience in today

[00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:38.460]
No man, I mean there's nothing to just some days

[00:42:38.460 --> 00:42:40.580]
Nothing's going on with sports, man

[00:42:40.580 --> 00:42:43.100]
Well turn on ESPN, maybe they got chicken chasing

[00:42:43.100 --> 00:42:45.520]
I'm telling you man, there's nothing going on.

[00:42:45.540 --> 00:42:50.000]
That's unacceptable. I mean, didn't any millionaire athletes murder somebody or something?

[00:42:50.020 --> 00:42:50.480]
Not today.

[00:42:50.860 --> 00:42:53.980]
Well you think maybe we should try something that would be entertaining?

[00:42:54.220 --> 00:42:57.160]
No way dude. That's worth it. Right, Gordon?

[00:42:57.340 --> 00:42:57.700]
Yes!

[00:42:58.020 --> 00:43:04.720]
The situation here is only sports. It gets as hard in the shorts.

[00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:08.160]
We're narrow casting only this for music kicks or politics.

[00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:12.460]
It's easy and easy. We've got gas not thin.

[00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:16.560]
Just go shoutout sport holes every day.

[00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:20.880]
We've got our heads and deep respect to jobs to make the family day.

[00:43:21.340 --> 00:43:22.880]
And we're closet days.

[00:43:23.660 --> 00:43:29.800]
If you are so, your alarm is set. Your mind is well-so. That's a set.

[00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:33.480]
We talk about fin like a frozen jackspot that just lose control.

[00:43:38.660 --> 00:43:39.880]
He's a washer.

[00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:45.940]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

[00:43:45.940 --> 00:43:50.860]
He brought gas up in just sports on the top.

[00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:52.460]
Yeah.

[00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:56.120]
So as speakers a squeaky ass to Gellie when we blow him out.

[00:43:56.460 --> 00:43:57.900]
Do you see him anywhere in the schedule this week?

[00:43:59.080 --> 00:43:59.600]
Nope.

[00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:01.560]
Well I'm thinking there may be a whole night.

[00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:04.100]
I see him Saturday from 2-5 Saturday afternoon.

[00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:10.140]
Just where you think the coast is queer or clear.

[00:44:10.980 --> 00:44:13.680]
He'll be going because the panthers were dumping that crap.

[00:44:14.620 --> 00:44:16.100]
We're also going to be dumping to Marlins.

[00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:18.980]
If we have a Marlins on that square we don't have any Marlins games because it's all stir-away.

[00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:19.500]
Christ.

[00:44:20.740 --> 00:44:24.180]
You mean to say that Thursday we got to do another, I got to do another whole four hours on Thursday?

[00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:24.480]
Yeah.

[00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:26.300]
What kind of a communist bunch of crap is that?

[00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:26.800]
It's great.

[00:44:27.340 --> 00:44:29.640]
We love the Marlins. Let's play two now.

[00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:32.060]
Okay, starting like it about 11-05 sounds good to me.

[00:44:32.980 --> 00:44:35.040]
Now how your cosbin this summer so far?

[00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:35.860]
Yeah, you know.

[00:44:36.680 --> 00:44:37.280]
They've been fine.

[00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:37.800]
Oh, I don't.

[00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:39.380]
If they find you I wouldn't be asking.

[00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:40.100]
They've been fine.

[00:44:40.900 --> 00:44:43.900]
Wish we could have more but you know what do you want?

[00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:49.100]
You'll be dismayed to learn that the guy with the eyes, I think I may have told you this before, long time ago,

[00:44:49.100 --> 00:44:53.940]
the guy with the eyes has got a clone and identical clone, Chie, at Woodbine.

[00:44:55.180 --> 00:44:59.440]
And he's got this very bizarre looking old broad that he hangs out with.

[00:44:59.540 --> 00:45:01.800]
I was just, and he braw beats her out.

[00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:04.020]
You lost 20 more in there when I was gone.

[00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:05.540]
You lost another 20 and that you bitch.

[00:45:05.540 --> 00:45:07.060]
You know, I mean just crazy.

[00:45:07.940 --> 00:45:08.580]
Strange stuff.

[00:45:09.820 --> 00:45:10.920]
He looks like him.

[00:45:11.080 --> 00:45:11.960]
He acts like him.

[00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:14.520]
This is the guy that told me, what do you do me a favor?

[00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:15.420]
No, look at my board.

[00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:16.220]
Don't look at my machine.

[00:45:16.340 --> 00:45:16.960]
Oh, that guy.

[00:45:17.180 --> 00:45:18.000]
Yeah, yeah.

[00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:18.780]
He's an idiot.

[00:45:19.460 --> 00:45:20.220]
Call him up and they hope.

[00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:26.600]
And he's a Pandarho and Pandarho and for some reason lately he's been around a lot with his estranged old broad,

[00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:30.020]
who I think is, I don't know what, I think she's like a captive or something.

[00:45:30.020 --> 00:45:30.480]
I don't know.

[00:45:30.940 --> 00:45:31.520]
Call him up.

[00:45:32.700 --> 00:45:33.100]
What?

[00:45:33.860 --> 00:45:34.260]
Mariposa.

[00:45:36.980 --> 00:45:38.580]
What the hell are you talking about?

[00:45:39.080 --> 00:45:39.180]
Spanish?

[00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:40.800]
Mariposa.

[00:45:40.940 --> 00:45:41.340]
What is that?

[00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:42.120]
Butterfly.

[00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:45.760]
So what's that guy do with it?

[00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:46.600]
What is it?

[00:45:46.700 --> 00:45:47.520]
It's a drug toy turf.

[00:45:47.660 --> 00:45:48.500]
You call a guy that basically.

[00:45:49.460 --> 00:45:50.280]
How about Pajanito?

[00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:51.160]
That too.

[00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:52.640]
Yeah, or Patel.

[00:45:53.460 --> 00:45:53.840]
Uh oh.

[00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:56.540]
When you were speaking in lace, now what the hell was that just talking about?

[00:45:56.540 --> 00:45:58.400]
We're going to get those ratings up by your own eyes.

[00:45:58.400 --> 00:45:58.820]
Yeah.

[00:46:00.860 --> 00:46:03.280]
And he winds up sitting next to me the other day.

[00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:06.760]
Thankfully only for a couple of minutes because like a, uh, my, uh, what is it?

[00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:07.240]
Mariposa.

[00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:09.320]
He keeps hopping from one machine to the other.

[00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:13.340]
And he's sitting next to me and he's, uh, yeah, give me a spin now.

[00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:15.180]
And he's pointing at the third rear.

[00:46:15.180 --> 00:46:18.620]
You know, where the spin thing would come up assuming he was going to get one which he didn't.

[00:46:18.620 --> 00:46:20.860]
And he, give me one now and he's pointing at it again.

[00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:25.420]
Blank, you know, I'm sitting there restraining myself from laughing my ass out loud, you know.

[00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:26.800]
Give me one now.

[00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:27.920]
And I'm not blank.

[00:46:28.500 --> 00:46:30.120]
I think you should just laugh at him and see what he does.

[00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:33.000]
No, I don't want to, I don't want to get started with him.

[00:46:33.060 --> 00:46:33.980]
I don't want nothing to do with him.

[00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:35.660]
Hey, buddy, do me a favor.

[00:46:35.720 --> 00:46:36.120]
Do look him.

[00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:37.840]
I mean, I'll look at whatever the hell I want to.

[00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:38.120]
Okay.

[00:46:38.220 --> 00:46:40.760]
And then guarantee you won't be one of the things that we're looking at.

[00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:43.520]
He looked, he looks like the guy with the eyes.

[00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:44.820]
He looked in, he acts like him.

[00:46:44.820 --> 00:46:45.660]
He's a retard.

[00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:48.980]
Now what is this thing that you just fasted to me?

[00:46:49.740 --> 00:46:52.140]
It's about the Pope saying everybody's wrong except for him.

[00:46:52.460 --> 00:46:54.320]
From Lorenza, go to Cattori, Italy.

[00:46:54.540 --> 00:46:55.160]
Where the hell light is.

[00:46:55.260 --> 00:46:55.720]
Where is that?

[00:46:55.720 --> 00:46:59.120]
And I keep forgetting to talk about the Latin ass that he wants to bring back to.

[00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:05.200]
The Nazi Pope has reasserted the universal primacy, or is that primacy is the bricks with

[00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:08.920]
say, primacy of the Roman Catholic Church and proving a document released today that says

[00:47:08.920 --> 00:47:13.420]
the Orthodox churches were defective and that other Christian denominations were not true

[00:47:13.420 --> 00:47:13.920]
churches.

[00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:14.960]
How do you like that?

[00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:21.420]
Well, there's only one way to find if they're defective and that's to hire a detective.

[00:47:23.420 --> 00:47:27.320]
Benedict approved a document from his old offices at the congregation with the doctrine of the faith that

[00:47:27.320 --> 00:47:30.580]
restates church teaching on relations with other Christians.

[00:47:31.140 --> 00:47:35.000]
It's the second time in the week that the Pope is corrected when he says,

[00:47:35.660 --> 00:47:38.100]
erroneous interpretations of the Second Vatican Council.

[00:47:39.540 --> 00:47:42.320]
Saturday Benedict revisited another key aspect of Vatican,

[00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:48.880]
too, by reviving the old Latin ass, dominus, an abyskis, a pandejo, a pandaho,

[00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:49.180]
whatever.

[00:47:49.580 --> 00:47:53.660]
Traditional Catholics cheered the move, but the more liberal ones called it a step back from Vatican

[00:47:53.660 --> 00:47:54.000]
too.

[00:47:54.300 --> 00:47:58.760]
What would you expect from the Nazi Pope like progress, like a step like into the 18th century or something?

[00:47:58.980 --> 00:48:01.440]
It's important for the people not to understand what's actually being said.

[00:48:01.980 --> 00:48:04.360]
Right, I'm going to have to just go and assault teens.

[00:48:05.580 --> 00:48:08.260]
Benedict to attend Vatican too is the onlyologian as long.

[00:48:08.440 --> 00:48:09.540]
Well, let me tell you this right now.

[00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:11.060]
I'm not going to waste my time reading this crap.

[00:48:11.500 --> 00:48:14.440]
You people with a religion crap man, get a life, okay?

[00:48:14.580 --> 00:48:16.160]
Get a life, get a brain.

[00:48:17.060 --> 00:48:18.060]
Start using it.

[00:48:18.260 --> 00:48:21.120]
Start using the function of the brain that has to do with like thinking.

[00:48:22.040 --> 00:48:26.340]
As opposed to the part that's got to do with being brainwashed and stupid and idiotic.

[00:48:27.140 --> 00:48:28.300]
All is garbage.

[00:48:29.720 --> 00:48:31.020]
All is tax-free garbage.

[00:48:31.140 --> 00:48:31.840]
That's the worst kind.

[00:48:34.140 --> 00:48:37.820]
857 votes on the pool and Larry is just, he's at Alphheim's self.

[00:48:38.020 --> 00:48:41.640]
Probably the bad breath and also that bag, you know, probably smells pretty bad at this point.

[00:48:43.540 --> 00:48:47.840]
I think sending the mayor for a lot of time, sending Jim Nagel some, some, some,

[00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:50.560]
whether you used to use toilet paper would be good now.

[00:48:50.940 --> 00:48:54.460]
Remember when you said that discussion about the old Cuban grandmothers, the Abuelas?

[00:48:54.680 --> 00:48:57.460]
Right, all the old world people apparently, and they do that in Europe too.

[00:48:57.840 --> 00:49:05.400]
And they would, you take the toilet paper and put it in a box, the U.T.L.A. paper and throw it into a box as opposed to like flushing it down the toilet because the,

[00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:08.260]
they would be saving it for a rainy day and one.

[00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:13.540]
The high-end scenario in Europe and they're still operating under that old system then that's supposed to block the pipes.

[00:49:13.660 --> 00:49:15.000]
So, are there any places where there's a hole in the floor?

[00:49:15.660 --> 00:49:19.400]
Well, but the paper's supposed to not, you're not supposed to flush paper in a lot of places.

[00:49:19.420 --> 00:49:20.640]
I wonder what kind of a hole that is.

[00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:21.980]
You're looking for the glory hole.

[00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:24.640]
Oh, that's what a lot of travel guides go out to the public find it.

[00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:26.240]
Been saying what?

[00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:30.340]
That they, in the travel guides depending on where you go, they say that you're not supposed to flush the paper

[00:49:30.340 --> 00:49:34.240]
because it clogs the pipes because they're narrow so you're supposed to throw it in the garbage.

[00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:35.220]
Oh, you're clogged?

[00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:35.440]
Yeah.

[00:49:36.960 --> 00:49:38.460]
You throw it in the garbage?

[00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:39.240]
In the garbage.

[00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:42.300]
Instead of it?

[00:49:42.300 --> 00:49:43.360]
After you used it?

[00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:44.560]
That's what they're saying.

[00:49:45.020 --> 00:49:47.360]
Oh, Jesus, God Almighty.

[00:49:47.560 --> 00:49:48.040]
That's right.

[00:49:48.360 --> 00:49:49.620]
Thank God for wide pipes.

[00:49:50.540 --> 00:49:51.220]
Yeah, exactly.

[00:49:52.260 --> 00:49:52.740]
Welcome.

[00:49:55.620 --> 00:49:59.320]
Online activists raised enough money in two hours yesterday afternoon to fly a banner,

[00:49:59.320 --> 00:50:04.900]
encouraging the impeachment of President Bush and Vice President Cheney over AT&T Park and San Francisco

[00:50:04.900 --> 00:50:07.300]
before it nights all star baseball game to which we say,

[00:50:07.300 --> 00:50:07.860]
I'll ride.

[00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:08.600]
Excellent.

[00:50:08.820 --> 00:50:11.560]
You go, boys, girls, whatever you are.

[00:50:12.500 --> 00:50:17.320]
The effort for an airborne banner began in the nationwide movement to impeach Cheney and Bush group on Facebook.com.

[00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:22.320]
It has been promoted by Pro and Peachment website after Downing Street.org.

[00:50:23.080 --> 00:50:27.540]
Time is short to raise the necessary money before baseballs all star game tonight in San Francisco.

[00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:32.760]
What are professors just out of control since you started Dissinery Potter?

[00:50:33.160 --> 00:50:37.760]
It says, you should get some info when talking about my anti-gay uncle who's running for me or Miami Beach.

[00:50:39.980 --> 00:50:43.240]
Well, why don't you send me some info while for a professor in Stashy?

[00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:43.720]
I should get.

[00:50:43.900 --> 00:50:44.740]
We're not going to get it, huh?

[00:50:44.920 --> 00:50:48.680]
I'm going to open a window and the information is going to fly in from like out in the etherics somewhere.

[00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:53.420]
I should get some info about some holophobic duke box that's running for me or Miami Beach.

[00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:53.780]
There you go.

[00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:55.120]
No, there was.

[00:50:55.120 --> 00:50:55.940]
I just kind of did that.

[00:50:56.340 --> 00:50:57.000]
Hold it on my butt.

[00:50:57.420 --> 00:50:58.920]
Now, was that the magic wand from Harry Potter?

[00:50:59.620 --> 00:51:00.340]
The one and only.

[00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:01.560]
Hahaha.

[00:51:01.860 --> 00:51:02.140]
Oh.

[00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:05.020]
Somehow, I just can't...

[00:51:05.020 --> 00:51:05.820]
I don't know what it is.

[00:51:05.980 --> 00:51:07.080]
I just can't envision seeing that.

[00:51:07.260 --> 00:51:09.820]
Even though the kid that plays Harry Potter now, he's starting to look like almost human.

[00:51:10.080 --> 00:51:10.720]
No, he's growing up.

[00:51:11.100 --> 00:51:15.020]
Yeah, well, he's in a movie called Equis where I am in a play or something like that where he's being naked.

[00:51:15.720 --> 00:51:17.080]
By the way, James Marsden is...

[00:51:17.080 --> 00:51:18.160]
I'd rather see James Marsden.

[00:51:18.280 --> 00:51:20.420]
And you know he's 34 years old, James Marsden.

[00:51:21.300 --> 00:51:22.400]
And I can't look old for you.

[00:51:22.740 --> 00:51:23.560]
That's what, yeah, exactly.

[00:51:23.560 --> 00:51:26.660]
So I feel like, you know, listen, Burist.

[00:51:27.480 --> 00:51:30.760]
I'd like to see this Facebook group being powered by actually making something happen in the world.

[00:51:30.940 --> 00:51:33.140]
Jacob Park, the Facebook group, is found or told raw story.

[00:51:33.420 --> 00:51:34.380]
He says it's pretty raw.

[00:51:35.180 --> 00:51:40.980]
As about 515 yesterday, after the organizers raised the 695 bucks needed to have the plane from 47 donations.

[00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:43.700]
The donations have been accepted at this website.

[00:51:43.700 --> 00:51:48.760]
And then it's got a link, I would you add a click on this story, which you can't click it like out in the air somewhere.

[00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:58.400]
The announcement was posted to the Facebook group at 3pm, Brian H. another group member first proposed the banner ID and the post on the site Sunday evening.

[00:51:59.260 --> 00:52:05.520]
One of the group's members, Timothy Fong, city contact, a Napa based company that would tour banner over the game tonight.

[00:52:06.120 --> 00:52:10.140]
The banner would fly over 18T Park in San Francisco while people will arrive for the All Star game.

[00:52:10.260 --> 00:52:16.140]
But because of airspace restrictions put in place after 9.11, it would have to land an hour before the first pitchfong tooled raw story.

[00:52:16.140 --> 00:52:18.480]
The game will be televised on Fox, beginning tonight.

[00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:21.260]
It will be heard on QIM by the way, for those with no TV set.

[00:52:21.880 --> 00:52:23.620]
Shout out already with that damn blackberry.

[00:52:24.420 --> 00:52:32.420]
It would be ideal in terms of citizens expressing dissatisfaction with their government that something out there during the National Anthem or during the first pitchfong said activists are committed to following the law.

[00:52:32.660 --> 00:52:34.120]
Now do you think the networks are going to show us this?

[00:52:34.760 --> 00:52:34.960]
No.

[00:52:35.080 --> 00:52:39.240]
Do you think that Fox, especially Fox, you think Fox is going to show us that banner?

[00:52:39.380 --> 00:52:40.680]
How much do you want to bet on that, sweetheart?

[00:52:42.380 --> 00:52:50.160]
Park City donated 50 bucks to get the banner airborne and other commentators on the Facebook group which has 9178 members said they were donating as low as 5 to 10 bucks.

[00:52:50.380 --> 00:52:52.320]
Whatever it took and it got in, it's going to fly tonight.

[00:52:52.660 --> 00:52:57.560]
The eagle will fly and John asked, ask, will they be there singing as the eagle fly or whatever he sings?

[00:52:57.900 --> 00:52:58.420]
Is that what he's saying?

[00:52:59.560 --> 00:52:59.700]
Yep.

[00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:01.940]
Is the Apaharito fly something like that?

[00:53:03.940 --> 00:53:05.140]
863 votes on that pool.

[00:53:05.140 --> 00:53:08.880]
I think the real contest there is between me and the Humper isn't it?

[00:53:09.060 --> 00:53:11.960]
Hank is 67 years old. God dang is he old, huh?

[00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:17.860]
He's got 59 votes and I've already got 46. I'm just a young whipper snack.

[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:20.300]
You are listening to an unsnathable deal, Roger.

[00:53:20.620 --> 00:53:21.980]
Carcad, f***ing blow.

[00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:22.900]
Well, good.

[00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:30.100]
This weekend it's called Live Earth and it will involve concerts on 7 continents of the mode awareness of global warming.

[00:53:30.100 --> 00:53:33.880]
Former Vice President Al Gore expected to perform over a 24 hour period.

[00:53:33.880 --> 00:53:36.040]
Al Gore, live in concert.

[00:53:36.320 --> 00:53:36.620]
Yeah.

[00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:39.800]
I never will.

[00:53:39.980 --> 00:53:43.060]
She was walking down the street.

[00:53:43.820 --> 00:53:44.420]
You are.

[00:53:44.580 --> 00:53:44.900]
It did be.

[00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:46.540]
It did be.

[00:53:46.540 --> 00:53:46.540]

[00:53:46.740 --> 00:53:48.420]
You will leave.

[00:53:49.380 --> 00:53:50.100]
You will leave.

[00:53:51.680 --> 00:53:52.520]
You will leave.

[00:53:52.520 --> 00:53:52.760]
You will leave.

[00:53:53.400 --> 00:53:53.640]
You will leave.

[00:53:54.100 --> 00:53:55.400]
I can't forget, Joe.

[00:53:57.260 --> 00:53:59.260]
I am not satisfied.

[00:53:59.260 --> 00:53:59.500]
You are not satisfied.

[00:54:03.100 --> 00:54:04.380]
You ain't seen nothing yet.

[00:54:04.500 --> 00:54:06.140]
Live Earth.

[00:54:07.220 --> 00:54:09.140]
I am excited.

[00:54:10.580 --> 00:54:10.980]
Oh.

[00:54:14.200 --> 00:54:16.780]
I can't control myself.

[00:54:18.260 --> 00:54:19.440]
I am excited.

[00:54:20.780 --> 00:54:21.140]
Yeah.

[00:54:21.740 --> 00:54:21.740]

[00:54:21.740 --> 00:54:22.120]
Yeah.

[00:54:22.260 --> 00:54:23.760]
Al Gore sings the hits.

[00:54:23.960 --> 00:54:25.220]
Al Gore rocks.

[00:54:25.540 --> 00:54:28.620]
I just want you to know why.

[00:54:29.160 --> 00:54:31.640]
It's the people who live really can.

[00:54:32.120 --> 00:54:33.320]
Thank you, my friends.

[00:54:33.740 --> 00:54:34.160]
Thank you.

[00:54:34.500 --> 00:54:35.260]
Thank you.

[00:54:35.400 --> 00:54:36.460]
Okay, so what do you make, Al?

[00:54:36.660 --> 00:54:37.160]
How do you think?

[00:54:38.980 --> 00:54:39.800]
He's about what?

[00:54:40.540 --> 00:54:41.400]
About Al Gore.

[00:54:42.060 --> 00:54:42.340]
What do you want?

[00:54:42.360 --> 00:54:42.760]
Yeah, sure.

[00:54:42.980 --> 00:54:43.200]
Why not?

[00:54:43.420 --> 00:54:44.180]
Let's do it.

[00:54:44.820 --> 00:54:45.620]
Do what?

[00:54:46.300 --> 00:54:46.780]
Drassy.

[00:54:47.080 --> 00:54:47.720]
Save the world?

[00:54:48.060 --> 00:54:48.360]
Yeah.

[00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:51.720]
Oh, here's the link from the professor about this.

[00:54:51.720 --> 00:54:58.180]
He's about his mom's uncle and about he's running from air, Miami, Beach or something like that.

[00:54:58.420 --> 00:54:59.720]
But it's on my hot mail here.

[00:54:59.780 --> 00:55:00.760]
It's going to take me forever today.

[00:55:00.860 --> 00:55:03.380]
I'll get to it to take a puke at it.

[00:55:04.680 --> 00:55:06.220]
I mean, it's important stuff, isn't it?

[00:55:07.580 --> 00:55:09.600]
In fact, maybe they can put him if he's home afobic enough.

[00:55:09.680 --> 00:55:10.620]
They can put him on a morning show.

[00:55:10.900 --> 00:55:12.720]
Boat campers can sit there and they can rub their knees together.

[00:55:14.320 --> 00:55:14.860]
What do you think?

[00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:17.520]
I think it's got possibility.

[00:55:17.700 --> 00:55:17.840]
No.

[00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:20.640]
I think it does.

[00:55:21.680 --> 00:55:27.460]
Doug Thompson says a Congress of co-conspirators, the stage is set for a showdown between President

[00:55:27.460 --> 00:55:29.660]
George Herbert Rudd, why do I say that?

[00:55:31.560 --> 00:55:33.280]
He was no prize either, by the way.

[00:55:33.980 --> 00:55:40.160]
Between President Bush and Congress, in the end, we might see who's got the biggest balls or perhaps if anyone has any of all Doug Thompson says.

[00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:42.020]
Who's got the biggest balls, baby?

[00:55:43.340 --> 00:55:45.560]
How much has James Marzen's been running for that?

[00:55:46.960 --> 00:55:51.500]
At issue is whether or not two former White House aides will be allowed to testify for a Congress in the proba

[00:55:51.500 --> 00:55:53.420]
they politically motivated fireings of U.S. attorneys.

[00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:59.700]
Bush, as expected, claimed executive privilege but said the aides could meet behind closed doors in author record sessions on the hill.

[00:56:00.980 --> 00:56:06.220]
While it's no surprise that Bush claimed executive privilege, it is extraordinary that he's claiming it not on current White House aides,

[00:56:06.580 --> 00:56:12.220]
but former step members who theoretically at least are free to make up their own minds about testifying because they no longer work in the administration.

[00:56:12.980 --> 00:56:22.580]
Under most circumstances, former White House counsel Harry Admeyer's and former political director Sarah Taylor should be able to decide for themselves if they want to appear before Congress, take the fifth or five to his penis.

[00:56:23.420 --> 00:56:32.840]
By claiming executive privilege for both Myers and Taylor, Bush is saying that his prior to control people is absolute that it covers not only those currently working for him but also anyone who ever worked for him.

[00:56:34.260 --> 00:56:45.440]
Jonathan Turley, professor of Constitutional Law George Washington University and a professional talking head on TV, said Bush's claim of executive privilege is absurd and that by offering letters from where he'd speak in private he dilutes his case.

[00:56:46.320 --> 00:56:52.760]
It would have been far better for the White House to say that aides wouldn't speak in any context of this goes this information Turley told the hill, newspaper and interview.

[00:56:53.960 --> 00:56:58.740]
Instead the White House adopted this absurd position that it's willing so long as there's not a threat of perjury.

[00:56:58.740 --> 00:57:05.680]
Another constitutional law expert, University Richmond professor Carl Tobias, says Bush's claim of executive privilege would not hold up in court.

[00:57:06.560 --> 00:57:15.420]
But the Galathe is not a guiding principle for Bush neither is the law. The president's proven time and time again that he'll do whatever he damn well pleases and dare those who object to try and stop him.

[00:57:16.180 --> 00:57:23.500]
So far and nobody not Congress, not the courts and not the law has successfully blackbushed from his vision of imperial rule from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.

[00:57:23.500 --> 00:57:33.920]
And those who expect Congress to step and put a stop to Bush's despotic rule will likely find that democratic leadership on the hill is not to the job they end up to it.

[00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:40.960]
To date the new leaders in Congress have followed out a collective asses when it comes to standing up to Bush or stopping him from writing a rough shot over them along the Constitution.

[00:57:41.620 --> 00:57:47.840]
Bush is an absolute ruler who enjoys absolute power with an odds that the Democrats can do absolutely nothing to stop him.

[00:57:48.680 --> 00:57:49.300]
That's right.

[00:57:49.880 --> 00:57:53.860]
Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi emasculated the Democrats when she took impeachment off the table.

[00:57:54.300 --> 00:58:04.660]
If Bill Clinton deserved to be impeached for lying about BJ's from White House intern, then George W. Bush deserves not only impeachment but conviction in a criminal trial followed by a life sentence pounding rock and leavenworth.

[00:58:05.540 --> 00:58:12.980]
But it won't happen because Pelosi lacks the balls, both figuratively and liberally, to take the necessary political risk to hallbush before a trap unilong charges.

[00:58:12.980 --> 00:58:18.380]
If Harry Reid had any balls, they're probably too old and trivial to pump any testosterone into his timid veins.

[00:58:18.880 --> 00:58:21.300]
Oh my God, old and trivial balls.

[00:58:22.180 --> 00:58:26.740]
Both Pelosi and Reid talk like leaders, but they fail to deliver both are a little more than political hacks.

[00:58:27.740 --> 00:58:34.180]
And by continuing to allow George W. Bush to remain in the presidency, they both complicit and willing co-conspirators and apply to destroy the USA.

[00:58:35.360 --> 00:58:38.240]
Nice going Dougie Doug Thompson talking about balls in America.

[00:58:39.140 --> 00:58:43.020]
It's almost enough to make him want to play that chocolate salty balls, although I said almost.

[00:58:43.860 --> 00:58:45.080]
Could we play that or what?

[00:58:45.280 --> 00:58:46.140]
Yeah, do it. Play it twice.

[00:58:47.580 --> 00:58:48.600]
Like I got it?

[00:58:49.280 --> 00:58:51.200]
I don't got it and we were not playing it.

[00:58:52.380 --> 00:58:52.740]
No.

[00:58:54.040 --> 00:58:55.860]
Okay, what are we doing on this pool thing over here?

[00:58:56.100 --> 00:58:57.220]
I wonder how the Humphors doing.

[00:58:57.920 --> 00:59:00.520]
A Humphor is 67. God, I'll might as he older what.

[00:59:00.900 --> 00:59:04.540]
Although I think he's, I don't know, Roger Ebert.

[00:59:04.540 --> 00:59:07.580]
Who doesn't belong on there? I'm telling you, he doesn't belong on there.

[00:59:08.300 --> 00:59:10.160]
He's a dead man in a suit.

[00:59:12.200 --> 00:59:16.040]
Now that Bob Barker and Rick Shaw are hung up, who are what other old, old, old, crow?

[00:59:16.680 --> 00:59:18.020]
How about the hangin' up? How about the crow?

[00:59:18.780 --> 00:59:22.140]
Larry King 265. We got 888 votes by the way, Chris.

[00:59:22.460 --> 00:59:24.260]
You got your thousand made easy today.

[00:59:24.980 --> 00:59:25.900]
Yep. I'm very glad.

[00:59:26.480 --> 00:59:32.240]
You see, when I sit down, when I sit my fat ass down in this chair, we got a head start, we got it made in the shade.

[00:59:32.240 --> 00:59:33.020]
We'd lemonade.

[00:59:34.320 --> 00:59:37.940]
Larry King 265. He's just crushing the field.

[00:59:38.920 --> 00:59:41.720]
Andy Rooney 135. Paul Harvey 128.

[00:59:42.440 --> 00:59:46.760]
Barbara Wall-Waw's got 85. Regis Filbert 80. What is it? 66.

[00:59:47.960 --> 00:59:49.900]
The Humphors got 60. I got 49.

[00:59:50.060 --> 00:59:53.060]
Boy, he's pulling away from me like I'm just laid out flat.

[00:59:54.420 --> 00:59:58.960]
G Gordon Litty 44, Roger Ebert 19. And again, I say just, that's disgraceful.

[00:59:58.960 --> 01:00:00.300]
Keep Jackson's got 18.

[01:00:01.300 --> 01:00:05.940]
John McLaughlin's got 15. And Morley Safer, Solomon Thessace, he's got 6.

[01:00:07.300 --> 01:00:09.760]
Morley Safer, book. What kind of name is that?

[01:00:12.140 --> 01:00:14.500]
188. I like that number though. 188. It's great.

[01:00:15.820 --> 01:00:19.460]
Nick Pantioni writes in his working gym, do I have time for this before the break? Yes I do.

[01:00:20.780 --> 01:00:24.180]
Anne Colter, typical American Christian. Oh, I'm into that.

[01:00:25.620 --> 01:00:29.320]
In 2006, Anne Colter said, Christianity fuels everything I write.

[01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:34.480]
Being a Christian means that I'm called upon to battle against lies, injustice, cruelty, hypocrisy.

[01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:36.820]
You know, all the virtues in the Church of Liberalism.

[01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:41.940]
In true American Christian styles, she's also called Janet Words of Faggot,

[01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:44.940]
which resulted in a fundraising bananza for the presidential hopeful.

[01:00:45.340 --> 01:00:48.240]
Colter wrote that Mr. Mrs. Edwards have a bumper stick around their car that reads,

[01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:50.100]
Ask me about my dead son.

[01:00:50.700 --> 01:00:54.980]
In reference to the death of their 16-year-old childweight, who was killed in the car crash in 1996,

[01:00:55.460 --> 01:00:59.520]
Colter criticized the 4-9-11 widows who had the audacity to support Democrats by writing

[01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:02.180]
that I've never seen people enjoying their husband's death so much.

[01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:07.620]
Regarding the liberal media coders said, my only regret with Tim McVey is he didn't go to the New York Times building.

[01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:12.420]
All of us repulsive rhetoric resulted in increased book sales for Colter,

[01:01:12.700 --> 01:01:16.560]
and more importantly, she got a huge dose of attention from each outrageous barb,

[01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:20.960]
something that her emaciated little being craves above spiritual or edible nourishment.

[01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:25.320]
A doctor should analyze this attention start skeletal scowl wag,

[01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:28.880]
and a psychology behind her infantile opinions and rattle-rousing statements.

[01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:30.620]
The diagnosis seems quite simple.

[01:01:31.580 --> 01:01:36.080]
She opposes abortion rights and views all liberals who favor abortion rights as the vileest people alive,

[01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:38.700]
because they condone the murder of innocent unborn babies.

[01:01:39.380 --> 01:01:41.760]
This get the bad guys mentality creates a free-for-all,

[01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:46.520]
anything goes brand of lunacy in the oxygen-deprived brains of the lives of Colter.

[01:01:47.060 --> 01:01:50.040]
Of course, she picks on liberals about other issues, but it's definitely abortion,

[01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:53.000]
that makes her stringy bleached blonde hair stand on end.

[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:57.040]
Who could forget anti-abortion nut-wing and rabid Christian Randall Terry,

[01:01:57.040 --> 01:02:01.380]
who was operating from the same warped perspective when he called for the bombing of plant parented clinics,

[01:02:01.740 --> 01:02:04.660]
and the murder of doctors would perform any kind of abortion procedure?

[01:02:05.220 --> 01:02:07.740]
If you appreciate the warped logic behind their belief system,

[01:02:08.020 --> 01:02:10.420]
you'd understand that Randall Terry and Anne Colter have no choice,

[01:02:10.420 --> 01:02:13.300]
but to act out against anyone they need to be baby killers.

[01:02:14.460 --> 01:02:17.240]
Granted, Colter has only started a state of her worst adj on it,

[01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:21.580]
which would be killed by terrorists, while Terry is capable of ordering such an act from his Christian followers.

[01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:25.480]
At its core, they share the same brand of religious conviction of leads religious fanatics

[01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:27.260]
to fly jets into the World Trade Center.

[01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:28.460]
They man the bad.

[01:02:30.420 --> 01:02:33.100]
Vileums can be written about people like Colter, who call themselves Christians,

[01:02:33.540 --> 01:02:37.340]
and act like repellent overbearing tyrants because they're so convinced they have to lock on the truth.

[01:02:37.340 --> 01:02:41.620]
They're never humble, seldom compassionate, and rarely Christ like anything they say or do.

[01:02:42.440 --> 01:02:47.060]
In 2002, Colter herself said, at best, Christ died from my sins and nothing else matters.

[01:02:47.740 --> 01:02:50.220]
And that sentiment rears its ugly head and every move she makes,

[01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:53.160]
though Christ himself would beg to differ, a lot of other things matter.

[01:02:54.360 --> 01:02:56.120]
Colter claims that the Bible is a favorite book,

[01:02:56.280 --> 01:02:58.600]
narrowly edging out the biography of the hillside Strangler.

[01:02:58.860 --> 01:03:01.480]
If this is true, one wonders if she can read Jesus' words

[01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:03.780]
with an even elementary level of comprehension.

[01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:06.500]
Just what did Jesus mean when he supposedly said,

[01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:08.880]
blessed are the peacemakers, love your enemies.

[01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:12.840]
It's easier for a camel to go through that of an edel and for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.

[01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:16.300]
Whatsoever you do to the least of my brothers, which you do unto me.

[01:03:17.460 --> 01:03:20.100]
A more recent statement by Colter further reveals her limited intellect.

[01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:22.040]
She said, I'm more of a man than any liberal.

[01:03:22.580 --> 01:03:26.200]
It's good that she acknowledges her, mainly, this considering her prominent Adam's apple,

[01:03:26.460 --> 01:03:27.940]
and her pre-pubescent boyish figure.

[01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:31.080]
Unfortunately, Colter thinks she's a femme fatale,

[01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:33.860]
and she intends to insult liberal men by imputing the masculinity.

[01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:36.360]
Colter doesn't understand that liberals are more evolved than her,

[01:03:36.660 --> 01:03:39.860]
and they don't worry about school yard tons that have no relevance in 2007.

[01:03:40.260 --> 01:03:43.360]
The fear that a skinny, cynical boy like Colter might label someone as sissy,

[01:03:43.660 --> 01:03:45.460]
but only have residents in conservative circles,

[01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:49.140]
where grown men still worry about who's got the most playing cards and their bikes spokes.

[01:03:50.500 --> 01:03:55.560]
The lack of manliness that Colter perceives in liberal men is nothing more than fodder for infantile conservative fans.

[01:03:55.900 --> 01:03:58.360]
Keep in mind that these are the same people who worry about naked statues

[01:03:58.360 --> 01:03:59.680]
in the halls of the Justice Department.

[01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:02.440]
They obsess about their neighbor's sex lives and giggle about anything

[01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:05.260]
so to do with the human potty parts.

[01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:07.740]
It says potty parts.

[01:04:07.860 --> 01:04:10.280]
I wonder if it means body parts or potty parts, well, whatever.

[01:04:10.940 --> 01:04:13.740]
Sadly, many of these folks are so repressed that eventually they get caught

[01:04:13.740 --> 01:04:17.280]
making kiddie porn videos with their favorite minister or some other heinous act

[01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:19.200]
born from years of denying human nature.

[01:04:19.780 --> 01:04:24.580]
The fact is that Colter isn't nearly as intelligent as she or a privileged silver spoon fat education would have,

[01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:27.120]
you believe, take away her family's influence and money,

[01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:30.860]
and she'd probably be typing them as about some sales first retirement party

[01:04:30.860 --> 01:04:34.020]
from a Romelu-Mole American company on the Oscars of New Cayenne, Connecticut.

[01:04:34.380 --> 01:04:38.140]
Even Bitterware and Astu, then she is today because nobody would pay her any attention.

[01:04:38.420 --> 01:04:40.100]
Whatever, it's a real ruckus.

[01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:41.860]
Bretton and Sayche!

[01:05:12.860 --> 01:05:15.580]
So he said him, free,

[01:05:17.420 --> 01:05:20.440]
living the power of music,

[01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:24.080]
designed to take us out.

[01:05:24.840 --> 01:05:27.660]
Our Constitution is useless,

[01:05:28.460 --> 01:05:31.140]
to let now, to let now,

[01:05:32.460 --> 01:05:34.640]
jeopardizing all security.

[01:05:36.100 --> 01:05:39.960]
It's those heroes vibrate, but they're so hip-free.

[01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:44.220]
I'll say the fight, see!

[01:05:46.340 --> 01:05:47.720]
Hopefully you'll see better now, Gore.

[01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:49.660]
It's level 32, and guess what?

[01:05:49.820 --> 01:05:53.660]
You know, this homophobic guy that wants to be my revenge?

[01:05:54.340 --> 01:05:54.700]
Yeah.

[01:05:55.260 --> 01:05:56.360]
Smaddy, go smack.

[01:05:56.700 --> 01:05:59.060]
I just sent you an article, I guess you already got it.

[01:06:00.180 --> 01:06:02.000]
If you could see the picture of him, did you see the picture?

[01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:03.020]
No, but somebody else.

[01:06:03.080 --> 01:06:05.960]
He looks like a cross between father time and you will give it.

[01:06:06.180 --> 01:06:10.160]
Somebody fives us an article and I'm just coming across your machine right now, probably the same thing.

[01:06:10.700 --> 01:06:12.180]
South Beach, maybe one of the...

[01:06:12.180 --> 01:06:13.360]
Is that what it starts out by saying?

[01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:15.200]
Sounds familiar.

[01:06:15.940 --> 01:06:18.360]
South Beach, maybe one of the most gay-welcome areas of the country,

[01:06:18.460 --> 01:06:20.920]
but that would all change, says Bill Smaddy,

[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.160]
voters elect him Mayor God forbid, that's...

[01:06:23.900 --> 01:06:24.660]
Damn God!

[01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:30.260]
Smad has registered to run, but already has begun his campaign with a huge banner over his front-line declaring,

[01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:33.440]
God created Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve.

[01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:34.480]
Yeah, it's about that.

[01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:35.340]
I see.

[01:06:35.860 --> 01:06:35.980]
Yes.

[01:06:35.980 --> 01:06:39.480]
The banner has raised the hackles of LGBT rights, groups and smats,

[01:06:39.560 --> 01:06:41.640]
neighbors, several of whom would complain to city hall.

[01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:44.580]
We don't allow no Madacone, he's not in Miami Beach,

[01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:46.500]
I'll tell you that right now, that's what Smaddy's saying.

[01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:49.400]
I want to see what this thing is, you facts.

[01:06:50.860 --> 01:06:51.560]
Same kind of deal.

[01:06:52.080 --> 01:06:52.800]
Is it the same thing?

[01:06:53.900 --> 01:06:55.360]
Different story, but about the same thing.

[01:06:56.040 --> 01:06:56.400]
I see.

[01:06:57.460 --> 01:06:59.160]
The banner is the raised the hackles, like I said.

[01:06:59.360 --> 01:07:02.300]
Smad originally placed a banner on public land outside his property line.

[01:07:02.620 --> 01:07:04.940]
He moved in front of his house when the city told him it was illegal.

[01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:09.220]
He is still in contravention of city regulations because of the size of the banner,

[01:07:09.420 --> 01:07:11.640]
which stretches across the entire width of his property,

[01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:15.020]
but says he'll fight city hall over what he sees as his first amendment right,

[01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:16.200]
to be a bigot.

[01:07:17.100 --> 01:07:19.640]
Miami Beach has become communist Russia, anything you do,

[01:07:19.780 --> 01:07:22.360]
anything they want, they tear down my sign, he says.

[01:07:23.260 --> 01:07:24.380]
Yeah, he's a lovely man.

[01:07:26.020 --> 01:07:26.900]
Oh man.

[01:07:27.240 --> 01:07:30.240]
Talk about from the stone age, you've got to see the picture.

[01:07:31.420 --> 01:07:34.000]
He told TV station WSVN channel,

[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.100]
and said, what about the first amendment we have a right to speak?

[01:07:36.440 --> 01:07:39.100]
The 76 year old smad said, if he becomes mayor,

[01:07:39.320 --> 01:07:41.980]
he will clean up South Beach's gay club scene.

[01:07:42.760 --> 01:07:43.500]
Went in doubt.

[01:07:44.140 --> 01:07:45.040]
Take him out.

[01:07:46.380 --> 01:07:48.180]
I promise you, when I become mayor,

[01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:50.800]
we're going to clean up all this funny business going on down there.

[01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:54.980]
He told Channel 10, I'm bringing back Miami Beach for families, he said.

[01:07:57.460 --> 01:08:00.140]
It goes on to say for those who may be unfamiliar with Smad,

[01:08:00.220 --> 01:08:03.220]
he's the white Jamaican dude with a long white hair and a fluffy white beard.

[01:08:03.220 --> 01:08:05.440]
He looks like a Bible bashing Santa Claus, it says.

[01:08:05.720 --> 01:08:08.520]
He looks like a cross between Santa Father Time and you will give him.

[01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:12.920]
According to Carol Huffman Guzman of the Alton Road Homeowners Association,

[01:08:13.480 --> 01:08:16.560]
his organization hasn't taken any official position on the banner.

[01:08:17.620 --> 01:08:21.520]
Gay rights groups professed outrage saying the giant son was outlandishly homophobic.

[01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:23.300]
It's surprising in this day and age,

[01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:27.100]
and the city is progressive in Miami Beach, we could still have this type of homophobious,

[01:08:27.260 --> 01:08:30.380]
a scoffed Kirk Arthur, spokesperson for Save Dayed.

[01:08:30.780 --> 01:08:31.700]
Oh, too late for that.

[01:08:32.500 --> 01:08:35.640]
This illustrates that no matter how far the city and its residents have evolved

[01:08:35.640 --> 01:08:38.460]
rights Frank Krasnicki, a Miami Beach City Commission candidate,

[01:08:38.660 --> 01:08:40.920]
in a chastising email that Hayden Pregnant is,

[01:08:40.980 --> 01:08:44.220]
are unfortunately alive and still a political tool for some.

[01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:48.000]
Smad, a city simply exercising his right to free speech.

[01:08:48.780 --> 01:08:51.380]
According to City of Miami Beach Police Information Officer,

[01:08:51.500 --> 01:08:53.020]
and net Rodriguez, Ken?

[01:08:53.600 --> 01:08:53.940]
No.

[01:08:54.380 --> 01:08:56.720]
Oh, Kofa, one of the officers is just Matt,

[01:08:56.860 --> 01:08:59.560]
six violations beginning this past Thursday because of the sign,

[01:08:59.560 --> 01:09:02.100]
and it's got nothing to do with what's written on it.

[01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:04.440]
Smad Rodriguez adds appeal to citations of hearings

[01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:06.660]
been tentatively set for July 12th.

[01:09:06.700 --> 01:09:08.660]
In the meantime, Adam and Eve stay put,

[01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:10.940]
where it's Joanne Green and whatever this is from.

[01:09:11.420 --> 01:09:12.520]
Do we know what this is from? No.

[01:09:13.280 --> 01:09:13.520]
Yes.

[01:09:14.380 --> 01:09:17.820]
Well, there you go, K, so that's one of the professor's relatives.

[01:09:18.580 --> 01:09:20.060]
Several times you'll move, hopefully.

[01:09:20.320 --> 01:09:21.620]
Hopefully, we move from the year of soon.

[01:09:22.500 --> 01:09:23.080]
Good God.

[01:09:23.500 --> 01:09:24.840]
Hey, Smaddy, get a life baby.

[01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:26.880]
Oh, Smaddy, I say.

[01:09:30.740 --> 01:09:31.060]
No.

[01:09:32.480 --> 01:09:33.720]
Holy moly, rat man.

[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.220]
A little light bulb just went off over the top of my head.

[01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:39.280]
912 votes on the pool.

[01:09:40.700 --> 01:09:41.660]
Who should we turn next?

[01:09:41.820 --> 01:09:43.240]
Now that Bob Barker and Ricky Ticking Show,

[01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:44.200]
I wonder how Rick Shaw is doing.

[01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:45.920]
You think, let's take a call from Rick Shaw, not?

[01:09:47.260 --> 01:09:48.680]
Now, how we do without these phone calls,

[01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:50.520]
I don't even have the thing turned on, you know what?

[01:09:51.580 --> 01:09:52.400]
We're doing fine.

[01:09:52.660 --> 01:09:53.140]
I haven't noticed.

[01:09:53.720 --> 01:09:53.900]
Oh.

[01:09:54.580 --> 01:09:55.700]
What was Chris about to say?

[01:09:55.700 --> 01:09:57.280]
That's because he doesn't want to scream calls.

[01:09:57.340 --> 01:09:57.780]
That's right.

[01:09:58.680 --> 01:09:59.940]
You are so lazy, man.

[01:09:59.940 --> 01:10:01.100]
He's making somebody friends, though.

[01:10:01.700 --> 01:10:03.800]
One thing about us fat people, man, we are lazy.

[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:04.780]
And then non-lazy.

[01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:05.480]
And then non-lazy, trust me.

[01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:06.020]
What is it?

[01:10:06.260 --> 01:10:08.960]
Smaddy, yeah, time to deal with the certain freaks.

[01:10:09.560 --> 01:10:10.420]
They love him, though.

[01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:11.360]
Oh, really?

[01:10:11.540 --> 01:10:12.800]
You got a bunch of fans now?

[01:10:12.920 --> 01:10:13.280]
Oh, yeah.

[01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:14.960]
Well, good.

[01:10:16.540 --> 01:10:18.900]
Larry King, 273, hang it up, Larry.

[01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:21.180]
Okay, before that bag bursts on the air.

[01:10:21.880 --> 01:10:23.700]
Talk about bombs bursting in air.

[01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:25.500]
Andy Roney 140.

[01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:27.980]
I should give the ages again, shouldn't I?

[01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:28.940]
Okay.

[01:10:29.460 --> 01:10:30.640]
Follow a close and good time.

[01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:31.180]
Larry 73.

[01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:32.740]
Andy Roney is 88.

[01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:33.480]
My God.

[01:10:34.580 --> 01:10:36.800]
88 years of eyebrow growth, can you imagine?

[01:10:38.380 --> 01:10:40.500]
Paul Harvey is also 88.

[01:10:40.740 --> 01:10:41.180]
129.

[01:10:41.660 --> 01:10:42.180]
Good day.

[01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:45.320]
Do you think there's anybody under the age of 100

[01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:46.500]
who even knows who he is anymore?

[01:10:47.140 --> 01:10:48.280]
I know, but I do.

[01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:50.560]
How do you know who he is?

[01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:51.900]
Well, Joe says it was a program.

[01:10:52.580 --> 01:10:53.440]
You used to what?

[01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:56.160]
Run the programs in my radio days earlier.

[01:10:56.960 --> 01:10:58.160]
You were in radio once upon a time.

[01:10:58.160 --> 01:10:59.200]
That's a lot of time that I can do it.

[01:10:59.220 --> 01:11:01.220]
I remember, too, me, too, long time ago.

[01:11:02.100 --> 01:11:03.460]
Barbara Walters, she's 77.

[01:11:03.860 --> 01:11:04.840]
She's got 87 votes.

[01:11:05.260 --> 01:11:06.220]
Registrar is 75.

[01:11:06.440 --> 01:11:07.400]
He's got 68 votes.

[01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:08.920]
She went, I give the numbers and the ages

[01:11:08.920 --> 01:11:10.640]
together like it's very confusing, which is good.

[01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:14.300]
The Humper, who is 67 as of six days ago,

[01:11:14.980 --> 01:11:16.140]
has got 63 votes.

[01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:17.920]
I'm 64 and got 49 votes.

[01:11:19.160 --> 01:11:20.460]
So we figured the Humper is like,

[01:11:20.460 --> 01:11:21.560]
we were through that before.

[01:11:21.700 --> 01:11:22.980]
I thought he was only one year older than me.

[01:11:23.900 --> 01:11:25.220]
And then, of course, we went through the thing with

[01:11:25.220 --> 01:11:26.000]
Mose Age.

[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:26.420]
Remember that?

[01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:29.700]
And we had to get his driver's license finally

[01:11:29.700 --> 01:11:30.640]
and show it to me.

[01:11:31.060 --> 01:11:31.840]
We didn't have to get it.

[01:11:31.880 --> 01:11:34.060]
He thrusted in my face and the license, too.

[01:11:34.660 --> 01:11:35.320]
Did he really?

[01:11:35.780 --> 01:11:36.500]
What about the difference?

[01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:39.780]
Did he go like that as he was doing it?

[01:11:40.060 --> 01:11:40.200]
No.

[01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:41.180]
He never said, do it, do it.

[01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:43.540]
He never said, do it.

[01:11:44.220 --> 01:11:44.740]
I never.

[01:11:45.180 --> 01:11:45.460]
49 votes.

[01:11:45.500 --> 01:11:47.020]
So the Humper's got me by 14 votes.

[01:11:47.200 --> 01:11:48.940]
And by three years or two and a half years anyway.

[01:11:49.120 --> 01:11:49.660]
You're old, Hank.

[01:11:49.660 --> 01:11:50.840]
He doesn't care.

[01:11:51.160 --> 01:11:52.220]
As long as he can keep eating.

[01:11:52.860 --> 01:11:53.600]
How does he do it?

[01:11:53.760 --> 01:11:55.840]
How does he stay alive?

[01:11:56.680 --> 01:11:56.920]
I don't know.

[01:11:57.020 --> 01:11:57.400]
Good genes.

[01:11:58.360 --> 01:11:59.640]
I got good genes, man.

[01:11:59.780 --> 01:12:02.140]
But if I had a direct, my old age, I'd be dead.

[01:12:02.140 --> 01:12:02.400]
I'll be dead.

[01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:03.760]
I'll be in bed.

[01:12:03.960 --> 01:12:06.240]
I'll be chopping off limbs and poking out eyes.

[01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:07.360]
And all of these things.

[01:12:08.140 --> 01:12:08.660]
Gordon Litty 44.

[01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:12.500]
That Bill Smatman, what a really handsome guy.

[01:12:13.180 --> 01:12:14.460]
Makes me feel good about myself.

[01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:17.040]
Roger Ebert's got 19 and I apologize for that.

[01:12:17.100 --> 01:12:18.640]
He's 65, Gordon Litty 75.

[01:12:19.080 --> 01:12:21.120]
Keith Jackson, who's 78.

[01:12:22.380 --> 01:12:23.320]
He's got 18 votes.

[01:12:24.680 --> 01:12:25.280]
John McLaughlin.

[01:12:25.780 --> 01:12:26.200]
Bye-bye.

[01:12:26.580 --> 01:12:27.260]
He's got 80 votes.

[01:12:27.500 --> 01:12:27.760]
15.

[01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:29.560]
You know, he was once a Catholic priest.

[01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:30.200]
Are you aware of that?

[01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:31.300]
No, I did not.

[01:12:31.660 --> 01:12:32.220]
Catholic priest.

[01:12:32.840 --> 01:12:34.440]
And he was once a rabid right-winger.

[01:12:34.500 --> 01:12:37.020]
I guess he probably still is a rabid right-winger, but you wouldn't know it.

[01:12:37.460 --> 01:12:38.620]
Now he's just a comedian.

[01:12:39.420 --> 01:12:39.900]
Bye-bye.

[01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:42.800]
John McLaughlin's got six and Morley's safer.

[01:12:42.800 --> 01:12:43.900]
Still only got six.

[01:12:44.020 --> 01:12:46.360]
And that's because we got a very anti-stomato guardians out there.

[01:12:46.360 --> 01:12:48.840]
As soon as that city was Jewish and safer means book.

[01:12:49.740 --> 01:12:56.380]
Baruch Hatad and I, No Tain Hatad Ra, Yadi Yadi Yadi Yashkudal, Yashkudal, Shreibu, Baba

[01:12:56.380 --> 01:12:56.740]
Maizu.

[01:12:57.460 --> 01:12:58.440]
And Yashkubibu too.

[01:12:59.500 --> 01:13:01.260]
All religious, focused, focused, man.

[01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:06.440]
How much, why would anybody in its right mind waste any time with his nonsense, huh?

[01:13:07.020 --> 01:13:07.760]
With fairy tales.

[01:13:07.900 --> 01:13:09.300]
It's one thing to waste time with fairies.

[01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:11.320]
It's nothing to waste time with fairy tales.

[01:13:11.620 --> 01:13:13.980]
Just ask Bill Smat and the Kimberbohl campers.

[01:13:14.140 --> 01:13:14.880]
The biggest name.

[01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:15.740]
They know their fairy.

[01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:19.560]
Adam and Steve.

[01:13:21.060 --> 01:13:21.540]
And you're a fairy king.

[01:13:21.740 --> 01:13:24.120]
They don't come any better than Neil Rudd.

[01:13:26.160 --> 01:13:27.700]
Now, in some addition.

[01:13:28.020 --> 01:13:31.360]
Isaiah Washington has given us some great hours of entertainment on Grey's Anatomy.

[01:13:31.580 --> 01:13:33.540]
This time it was personal drama.

[01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:35.340]
Any members of the cast called you?

[01:13:35.840 --> 01:13:35.980]
Yes.

[01:13:36.260 --> 01:13:37.920]
I got a...

[01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:39.000]
Whoa.

[01:13:40.460 --> 01:13:40.980]
Whoa.

[01:13:41.420 --> 01:13:41.860]
I...

[01:13:41.860 --> 01:13:48.780]
Play it and I attacked him, called him a homophobic slur, and then I showed him, tried to

[01:13:48.780 --> 01:13:49.760]
show him a death wall.

[01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:51.160]
Nothing against VNGay.

[01:13:51.400 --> 01:13:51.780]
No.

[01:13:52.180 --> 01:13:53.600]
My wife opens the gun ripples.

[01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:54.440]
You like him?

[01:13:54.980 --> 01:13:56.500]
No comment, no comment, no comment.

[01:13:57.060 --> 01:13:59.000]
In fact, edition will be right back.

[01:14:00.940 --> 01:14:03.600]
Club 45 is 560 WQAM.

[01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:04.140]
It's a Tuesday.

[01:14:04.140 --> 01:14:05.400]
We got the man of dog or two.

[01:14:06.180 --> 01:14:07.900]
And then we got the Humperwood at the power hour.

[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:09.700]
How's that 45 hour doing, by the way?

[01:14:09.700 --> 01:14:10.020]
Do we know?

[01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:11.520]
Don't we?

[01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:13.400]
We won't get the hour leaves until this next...

[01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:14.100]
The book comes out.

[01:14:14.100 --> 01:14:18.420]
And it's coming out, I'll remember the Alvosto baby on a Wednesday when you're going to be on.

[01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:22.100]
Remember I mentioned the other day that I might make a cameo that day because the rings

[01:14:22.100 --> 01:14:22.540]
were coming out.

[01:14:22.540 --> 01:14:22.740]
Yeah.

[01:14:22.780 --> 01:14:23.100]
I forget it.

[01:14:23.260 --> 01:14:23.800]
Oh, okay.

[01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:25.080]
What?

[01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:27.520]
Why I just don't want to get your hopes up.

[01:14:27.720 --> 01:14:28.960]
I mean, you think I'm really going to do that?

[01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:30.140]
Why not?

[01:14:30.440 --> 01:14:33.460]
I may be crazy, but in my back, it's always in the middle of the week when I got the day

[01:14:33.460 --> 01:14:33.720]
going.

[01:14:33.920 --> 01:14:35.660]
I have to be a day weekend with the one that...

[01:14:35.660 --> 01:14:35.820]
Like that.

[01:14:36.020 --> 01:14:36.700]
It's a public age.

[01:14:36.700 --> 01:14:37.020]
Like a Bible.

[01:14:38.780 --> 01:14:39.520]
Oh, man.

[01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:42.120]
924 votes on the pool.

[01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:43.720]
How's the Humper doing with the me?

[01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:45.480]
He's got...

[01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:47.080]
64, I have 49.

[01:14:47.300 --> 01:14:48.280]
Never want to throw other people out.

[01:14:49.340 --> 01:14:49.980]
Yeah, leave us alone.

[01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:50.680]
Get off our case.

[01:14:52.360 --> 01:14:54.760]
Michael Moore, slime, CNN and Wolf Blitzer on live TV.

[01:14:54.920 --> 01:14:55.380]
You go, Mike.

[01:14:56.160 --> 01:14:57.800]
I told you I watched this sickle last week.

[01:14:57.940 --> 01:14:58.360]
Did that say anything?

[01:14:59.080 --> 01:14:59.400]
Yes.

[01:14:59.960 --> 01:15:00.720]
Now, have you seen it?

[01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:02.940]
Yeah, you did because you said last week you didn't need to be lying.

[01:15:03.420 --> 01:15:03.580]
Right.

[01:15:03.660 --> 01:15:04.740]
Now, what would you recommend?

[01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:05.920]
Sickle or Harry Potter?

[01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:06.400]
The new one.

[01:15:06.580 --> 01:15:07.440]
Oh, that's funny.

[01:15:08.820 --> 01:15:09.680]
Come on.

[01:15:11.320 --> 01:15:12.320]
Adam and Steve.

[01:15:12.920 --> 01:15:13.740]
What the hell was that all about?

[01:15:14.920 --> 01:15:18.160]
Before a live interview with documentary filmmaker Michael Moore, CNN aired a segment

[01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:23.120]
entitled Sickle Reality Check in which Dr. Sanjay Gupta, or I nearly pooped it with

[01:15:23.120 --> 01:15:27.200]
the last time I saw Dr. Gupta, the no-archief medical correspondent, aimed to keep more

[01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:29.460]
honest and fact check his new film, Sickle.

[01:15:30.300 --> 01:15:34.340]
The four-minute piece concluded that Moore did fudge the facts and it implied that Sickle

[01:15:34.340 --> 01:15:38.060]
was misleading and portraying healthcare systems in other countries, such as France, the

[01:15:38.060 --> 01:15:40.400]
UK and Canada, as better than the one in the USA.

[01:15:41.640 --> 01:15:45.920]
When given a chance to speak, Moore immediately put a host-walt blitz free down the defensive.

[01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:50.080]
The report was so biased that can't imagine what pharmaceutical companies ads are coming

[01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:53.600]
up right after our break here said Moore, why don't you tell the truth to the American

[01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:54.020]
people?

[01:15:54.300 --> 01:15:54.760]
You go, Mike.

[01:15:55.900 --> 01:15:59.100]
I wish that CNN and the other mainstream media would just for once tell the truth about

[01:15:59.100 --> 01:16:00.220]
what's going on in this country.

[01:16:00.600 --> 01:16:04.140]
Moore argued that CNN has got such a lousy track record of reporting the truth about

[01:16:04.140 --> 01:16:08.160]
the war in Iraq and asking tough questions that Americans should be really skeptical of

[01:16:08.160 --> 01:16:09.120]
the reporting on healthcare.

[01:16:10.300 --> 01:16:14.320]
Well, there's a year friend Candy Cali is on CNN right now as a matter of fact, if you

[01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:15.040]
got a big screen.

[01:16:15.460 --> 01:16:15.820]
My buddy.

[01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:18.300]
You're the ones who are fudging the facts, Moore.

[01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:19.900]
You fudge the facts to the American people.

[01:16:19.980 --> 01:16:22.260]
Now, I don't know how long about this issue, about the war.

[01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:25.160]
I'm just curious, when are you going to just stand there and apologize to the American

[01:16:25.160 --> 01:16:28.480]
people for not bringing the truth to them that isn't sponsored by some major corporation?

[01:16:30.420 --> 01:16:34.060]
Blitz or Grudy Fencevon backed up his fellow CNN employees saying that he would stand

[01:16:34.060 --> 01:16:37.040]
behind correspondence and say, Gupta's record on medical issues.

[01:16:37.280 --> 01:16:41.060]
Moore in response, about the posterity bottle on his website, Michael Moore.com, showing

[01:16:41.060 --> 01:16:42.380]
that Gupta's facts weren't accurate.

[01:16:43.180 --> 01:16:46.620]
I'm going to put the real facts up there on my website, said Moore so that people can see

[01:16:46.620 --> 01:16:49.300]
that what he said was just absolutely wrong.

[01:16:49.500 --> 01:16:49.840]
Absolutely.

[01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:50.380]
Right.

[01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:54.560]
Turn to the war in Iraq, Moore accused Gupta, who spent time embedded with US troops in

[01:16:54.560 --> 01:16:58.780]
Iraq and the mainstream media at large refusing to ask our leaders the hard questions and

[01:16:58.780 --> 01:17:00.120]
demand the honest answers.

[01:17:00.880 --> 01:17:04.220]
Morely, the blame for the continued US involvement in the war in Iraq at the feet of the media

[01:17:04.220 --> 01:17:08.000]
arguing that they feel that they do their jobs and question the Bush war policy, Blitz

[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:11.580]
Grudy refused to argue with Moore about Iraq and instead steered the conversation back

[01:17:11.580 --> 01:17:12.620]
to the topic of healthcare.

[01:17:13.960 --> 01:17:17.760]
Moore was asked which of the US presidents of candidates he thought would best fix America's

[01:17:17.760 --> 01:17:18.420]
healthcare system.

[01:17:18.720 --> 01:17:22.240]
He didn't name a specific candidate but said that the Democratic candidates is a whole

[01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:25.900]
need to be more specific about how they plan to achieve their goal of universal healthcare.

[01:17:26.440 --> 01:17:30.020]
Our own government admits that because of the 47 million who aren't insured we now

[01:17:30.020 --> 01:17:33.820]
have about 18,000 people a year who died in this country just because they don't have

[01:17:33.820 --> 01:17:34.420]
health insurance.

[01:17:35.060 --> 01:17:37.860]
That's 6, 9, 11s every single year concluded Moore.

[01:17:38.180 --> 01:17:40.960]
We need universal healthcare that's free for everyone who lives in this country.

[01:17:41.060 --> 01:17:44.160]
It'll cost us less than what we're spending now lining the pockets of those private

[01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:46.620]
health insurance companies or these pharmaceutical companies.

[01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:51.440]
After the interview, Blitz Grudy found sympathy from fellow CNN hosts Lou Dobbs and Jack

[01:17:51.440 --> 01:17:51.980]
Cavarty.

[01:17:51.980 --> 01:17:55.900]
After watching that Michael Moore interview said Cavarty, I've decided whatever CNN's

[01:17:55.900 --> 01:17:56.740]
paying it ain't enough.

[01:17:57.760 --> 01:18:02.620]
As the kissed Wolf says, this is very, very Israeli, pro-Israeli Jewish ass.

[01:18:03.480 --> 01:18:05.900]
And then it's got the video on there from the situation room.

[01:18:06.140 --> 01:18:08.900]
It looks like his boat camper would say a really bad situation for Wolf.

[01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:12.840]
Tenth and Wolf don't forget it's a pretty good movie.

[01:18:13.480 --> 01:18:13.660]
Okay.

[01:18:14.040 --> 01:18:17.200]
Don't read the reviews on there and I'm, you know, IMDb or I won't.

[01:18:17.460 --> 01:18:18.320]
It's one thing I've learned.

[01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:18.680]
Check it out.

[01:18:18.680 --> 01:18:22.960]
It's bad enough to read the reviews of like movie critics to discover what you want to

[01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:23.760]
go see if looking out.

[01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:24.620]
That's bad enough.

[01:18:25.080 --> 01:18:27.700]
When we read this stuff, just everyday shluppers put out there.

[01:18:28.040 --> 01:18:28.760]
Forget about it.

[01:18:28.860 --> 01:18:29.380]
What's all they know?

[01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:29.860]
It's good.

[01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:30.800]
It's a good mob movie.

[01:18:32.060 --> 01:18:33.660]
And of course, I know you love mob movies.

[01:18:33.940 --> 01:18:34.140]
Sure.

[01:18:34.560 --> 01:18:37.340]
And it's got James Martin in it, which you wouldn't hold it against him in the fact that

[01:18:37.340 --> 01:18:37.900]
he looks so good.

[01:18:38.040 --> 01:18:39.880]
It's got a lot of ugly people in it too, so you'll feel better.

[01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:43.640]
Oh man.

[01:18:44.520 --> 01:18:46.480]
Although I checked out a course during the break.

[01:18:46.600 --> 01:18:47.420]
I checked out some pictures.

[01:18:48.140 --> 01:18:49.640]
He looks better than Bill Smad.

[01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:50.200]
I'll say that.

[01:18:50.520 --> 01:18:52.800]
But then again, but then again, so does your ass.

[01:18:53.440 --> 01:18:54.020]
Thank you.

[01:18:54.140 --> 01:18:54.220]
Wow.

[01:18:55.020 --> 01:18:57.500]
No, did you, did you, you haven't seen that picture yet?

[01:18:57.880 --> 01:18:58.240]
No, no.

[01:18:58.480 --> 01:18:59.840]
I'm going to have to email that to you.

[01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:01.300]
I eat for the length of time.

[01:19:01.300 --> 01:19:03.080]
It's really that illuminating.

[01:19:03.780 --> 01:19:06.560]
Father time, sandy claws and eel gibbons.

[01:19:08.040 --> 01:19:09.800]
930 votes on our award any pool today.

[01:19:11.540 --> 01:19:14.020]
Kristen even have to be like Brickaswet today to get to a thousand.

[01:19:14.020 --> 01:19:17.000]
See how much greater it is what I'm here to do these polls, Chris?

[01:19:17.420 --> 01:19:19.600]
It's the wonder by the hand down the garden pan, huh?

[01:19:20.040 --> 01:19:21.560]
It's wonderful when you hear the push the pole.

[01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:23.820]
Yeah, quick kiss in my ass.

[01:19:24.060 --> 01:19:24.760]
You're not fooling anybody.

[01:19:25.920 --> 01:19:26.300]
Fendého.

[01:19:26.860 --> 01:19:27.120]
What?

[01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:31.600]
Cindy she and the fallen soldiers mother who galvanized the anti-war movement said

[01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:36.980]
Sunday that she plans to run against House Speaker Nancy Pelosi unless, unless Nancy moves

[01:19:36.980 --> 01:19:38.580]
to House President Bush in the next two weeks.

[01:19:38.660 --> 01:19:39.200]
You go, Cindy.

[01:19:39.660 --> 01:19:41.580]
I'm going to move to California just so I can vote for her.

[01:19:41.700 --> 01:19:42.100]
What do you say?

[01:19:42.100 --> 01:19:42.780]
All right.

[01:19:44.120 --> 01:19:48.580]
She and Sid shall run against the San Francisco Democrat in 2008 as an independent if Pelosi

[01:19:48.580 --> 01:19:52.380]
doesn't file articles from impeachment against Bush by July 23rd.

[01:19:52.480 --> 01:19:56.320]
That's when she and enter supporters out of Riven Washington DC after a 13-day caravan

[01:19:56.320 --> 01:20:01.040]
and walking tour starting from the group's war port to a site near Bush's Crawford Ranch.

[01:20:02.620 --> 01:20:06.060]
Democrats at Americans feel betrayed by the Democratic leadership she and told the AP.

[01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:07.580]
We hired them to bring it into the war.

[01:20:07.700 --> 01:20:09.140]
I'm not too far from San Francisco.

[01:20:09.140 --> 01:20:10.920]
So it would be too big of a move for me.

[01:20:11.020 --> 01:20:11.980]
I give her a run for a money.

[01:20:11.980 --> 01:20:13.900]
She said she kick her ass in Frisco.

[01:20:14.080 --> 01:20:14.400]
You know that?

[01:20:15.040 --> 01:20:17.360]
She would cook her a big fat smelly ass.

[01:20:19.020 --> 01:20:21.320]
Messages left with Pelosi staff were not immediately returned.

[01:20:21.620 --> 01:20:23.120]
The White House didn't comment on she and his plan.

[01:20:23.240 --> 01:20:25.340]
They basically pretend she doesn't exist, you know?

[01:20:25.800 --> 01:20:25.920]
Right.

[01:20:26.860 --> 01:20:29.360]
She plans for official candidacy announcement today.

[01:20:30.880 --> 01:20:34.180]
Sunday wrapped up on this expected to be her final week in at the five-ever Crawford

[01:20:34.180 --> 01:20:37.940]
lot that she sold to California radio talk show host B. Walker who plans to keep it

[01:20:37.940 --> 01:20:38.680]
open to protesters.

[01:20:38.680 --> 01:20:41.440]
B. Walker that's not the one that's married to Jim Lampley is it?

[01:20:44.160 --> 01:20:44.560]
Yes.

[01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:45.480]
It is?

[01:20:45.780 --> 01:20:45.920]
Yeah.

[01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:47.440]
Why did you why did you post so long?

[01:20:47.440 --> 01:20:49.240]
I was because I thought it was a trick question.

[01:20:50.340 --> 01:20:53.460]
Why you thought I was going to say something grotesque about the fact that she's got no

[01:20:53.460 --> 01:20:54.240]
what is it?

[01:20:54.700 --> 01:20:57.520]
She has fused fingers and tears.

[01:20:57.520 --> 01:20:59.400]
She has fused fingers what does that mean?

[01:20:59.640 --> 01:21:03.800]
They look like flippers kind of like flipper like bony nodded.

[01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:05.840]
Do they look like Luke Calvin?

[01:21:06.200 --> 01:21:06.600]
No.

[01:21:07.140 --> 01:21:07.460]
No.

[01:21:07.880 --> 01:21:08.560]
Not that good.

[01:21:09.660 --> 01:21:10.820]
What is he about eighty now?

[01:21:10.920 --> 01:21:13.360]
Luke Calvin ought to hang it up too may must be about a hundred years old.

[01:21:14.060 --> 01:21:16.280]
See that's one thing you know most I will say this.

[01:21:17.120 --> 01:21:20.580]
Most people at one time in their life there was a period of time that at some age when

[01:21:20.580 --> 01:21:23.520]
they looked pretty good maybe it was when they first came out of their mother's womb.

[01:21:23.700 --> 01:21:27.440]
Maybe I looked good then because since then never we had all covered in blood and mucus

[01:21:27.440 --> 01:21:27.700]
of life.

[01:21:27.720 --> 01:21:29.900]
Yeah well I'm saying compared to the rest of their life.

[01:21:30.120 --> 01:21:31.020]
Thorded and pointy headed.

[01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:33.960]
For some of us that was as good as we ever looked at that that's what I'm trying to say

[01:21:33.960 --> 01:21:34.200]
to you.

[01:21:35.840 --> 01:21:39.840]
She first came to Crawford in August 2005 during Bush's vacation and made me talk to him

[01:21:39.840 --> 01:21:42.200]
about the war that claimed her son cases life in 2004.

[01:21:42.700 --> 01:21:46.780]
She became the face of the anti-war movement during her twenty-six day roadside vigil at

[01:21:46.780 --> 01:21:51.340]
12000 but it also drew counter protest of Bush supporters many of whom said she was hurting

[01:21:51.340 --> 01:21:52.280]
troop morale.

[01:21:52.860 --> 01:21:56.220]
She in who has never helped political office recently said that she was leaving the Democratic

[01:21:56.220 --> 01:22:00.120]
Party because it caved into the present and of course she is absolutely correct.

[01:22:01.420 --> 01:22:05.080]
Last week she announced her care about a Washington which he calls the People's Accountability

[01:22:05.080 --> 01:22:05.460]
Movement.

[01:22:05.940 --> 01:22:09.400]
I didn't expect to be back so soon but the focus is different than it was before she

[01:22:09.400 --> 01:22:13.260]
had said Sunday instead of talking and making accusations we're going into communities

[01:22:13.260 --> 01:22:16.240]
and talking to the people who have been hurt by the Bush regime we're finding out how

[01:22:16.240 --> 01:22:17.500]
we can help people she be saying.

[01:22:18.100 --> 01:22:22.780]
She in who turns fifty today said Bush should be impeached because she believes he missed

[01:22:22.780 --> 01:22:24.820]
like the public while reasons for going for war.

[01:22:25.020 --> 01:22:29.200]
Violated as a Geneva Convention by torturing detainees and crossed the line by committing

[01:22:29.200 --> 01:22:30.760]
the prison sentence of Scooter Libby.

[01:22:31.160 --> 01:22:35.100]
She said otherwise from Pigeon Mayor the domestic spying program and the inadequate and tragic

[01:22:35.100 --> 01:22:36.380]
response to Hurricane Katrina.

[01:22:36.820 --> 01:22:39.380]
How about first sluppers doing Orleans by the way they doing any better?

[01:22:39.740 --> 01:22:39.980]
No.

[01:22:40.640 --> 01:22:40.640]

[01:22:41.400 --> 01:22:44.960]
She in said she hopes Pelosi frowns out a hell of impeachment so she can move onto her next

[01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:49.820]
project including overseas trips for humanitarian work but if not she in said she's ready to

[01:22:49.820 --> 01:22:50.040]
run.

[01:22:50.860 --> 01:22:54.180]
I'm doing it to encourage other people to run against congress members who are not doing

[01:22:54.180 --> 01:22:57.940]
their jobs who are be holding this special interest she in said Pelosi let the people down

[01:22:57.940 --> 01:23:01.380]
and work hard to put Democrats back in power who we thought were a hope for change.

[01:23:02.280 --> 01:23:05.460]
And you know why and what the deal was with that and that's because they were naive.

[01:23:06.620 --> 01:23:06.740]
Yep.

[01:23:07.420 --> 01:23:11.440]
Pelosi was elected to the House of 87 and became the first woman speaker in January and

[01:23:11.440 --> 01:23:12.480]
the hubber and Drared.

[01:23:13.540 --> 01:23:16.960]
She in said she lives in a Sacramento suburb of the decline of the close to city citing

[01:23:16.960 --> 01:23:17.860]
safety reasons.

[01:23:18.100 --> 01:23:21.160]
Here is outside Pelosi's district but there are no district residents who require

[01:23:21.160 --> 01:23:24.360]
members of Congress according to the California Secretary of State's orifice.

[01:23:25.040 --> 01:23:29.060]
I mean if Arnold can be the governor who is an Austrian Nazi bastard why the hell can't

[01:23:29.060 --> 01:23:32.940]
she be a you know speaker of the House who is something anyway she ain't going to be

[01:23:32.940 --> 01:23:33.580]
speaker of the House.

[01:23:33.580 --> 01:23:34.720]
Yeah you are an e-dog.

[01:23:34.920 --> 01:23:40.020]
That's right screw you Arnold you Nazi bastard you you fooling you below me and not only

[01:23:40.020 --> 01:23:41.880]
that but oh you're fairing.

[01:23:41.880 --> 01:23:42.280]
That too.

[01:23:44.040 --> 01:23:47.280]
938 votes in the next hour we're going to go over a thousand easily we'll slide right

[01:23:47.280 --> 01:23:51.400]
in there baby just like slide in a home plate during the night's all-star game are you

[01:23:51.400 --> 01:23:54.060]
all pumped up about that now you're going to be watching Chris I don't know.

[01:23:54.780 --> 01:23:57.080]
I don't know probably not probably not.

[01:23:57.600 --> 01:23:58.460]
Well why not.

[01:23:58.700 --> 01:24:01.800]
Can you think of all the more important than watching baseball especially a meaningless

[01:24:01.800 --> 01:24:02.580]
all-star game.

[01:24:04.060 --> 01:24:08.340]
Alex Rio so was selected to be all-star game from the Toronto Blue Jays congratulations.

[01:24:09.360 --> 01:24:10.540]
You're not excited about that?

[01:24:10.940 --> 01:24:11.060]
No.

[01:24:12.060 --> 01:24:15.900]
They like me so much here they changed the name from the sky dome which to me was one

[01:24:15.900 --> 01:24:20.420]
of the best names of a stadium ever ever to the Roger Center just because I came here

[01:24:21.020 --> 01:24:24.840]
like that huh you think it's just a coincidence don't you.

[01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:25.220]
Sure.

[01:24:26.320 --> 01:24:29.760]
That's a cable and the phone company everything is named Rogers down that's only because

[01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:34.340]
of me anybody buying it no better than Bill Smith I'll take that that's that ain't

[01:24:34.340 --> 01:24:35.320]
where it at is Bill Smith.

[01:24:36.660 --> 01:24:41.020]
I have seen some pictures of some really funky looking people but you know something what

[01:24:41.020 --> 01:24:44.760]
in a way it's good it looks like that because if he looked like like a real person

[01:24:44.760 --> 01:24:46.480]
that somebody might actually listen to what he's saying.

[01:24:47.060 --> 01:24:47.820]
Makes sense.

[01:24:47.820 --> 01:24:50.500]
It's about Adam and Eve and not Adam and Steve.

[01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:52.540]
My God.

[01:24:53.480 --> 01:24:55.360]
1156-560-2202.

[01:24:55.780 --> 01:25:00.940]
This is very quick whenever I shape my balls I listen to the Neil Rogers 12-1 hour.

[01:25:03.840 --> 01:25:04.960]
Yeah yeah.

[01:25:05.760 --> 01:25:06.780]
Where's that y'all.

[01:28:09.960 --> 01:28:11.680]
I know you guys are getting a lot of crap.

[01:28:11.780 --> 01:28:12.540]
Oh, he's still playing.

[01:28:12.640 --> 01:28:13.100]
I think you know what?

[01:28:13.160 --> 01:28:13.520]
I like it.

[01:28:13.600 --> 01:28:15.680]
I don't really care what you like it or not or what they think I like it.

[01:28:15.680 --> 01:28:16.280]
I don't care what you like it or not.

[01:28:16.460 --> 01:28:19.880]
And you want to like it because you did that great editing job and everybody kisses your

[01:28:19.880 --> 01:28:20.280]
ass boy.

[01:28:20.400 --> 01:28:21.480]
George is in a phenomenal job.

[01:28:21.500 --> 01:28:22.140]
And what he did.

[01:28:22.380 --> 01:28:22.820]
I do like it.

[01:28:23.820 --> 01:28:25.680]
So why do we have to listen to these other losers?

[01:28:25.740 --> 01:28:26.420]
They're like Chris.

[01:28:27.020 --> 01:28:27.840]
Well, you know, I'm weak.

[01:28:27.980 --> 01:28:28.600]
I listen to anybody.

[01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:28.820]
Yeah.

[01:28:29.140 --> 01:28:32.240]
The day when we start letting Chris program the show that's the day we might as well hang

[01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:34.120]
it up like, and then let Greg be the upcoming.

[01:28:34.120 --> 01:28:36.960]
Then you'll appreciate me once you have to work with Greg be the.

[01:28:37.280 --> 01:28:40.420]
I believe the complaint was that it was played too much.

[01:28:40.740 --> 01:28:41.020]
Too bad.

[01:28:41.920 --> 01:28:43.300]
I thought you can't play it at all.

[01:28:43.640 --> 01:28:44.320]
It's like sex.

[01:28:44.500 --> 01:28:45.320]
You can't have too much.

[01:28:45.480 --> 01:28:46.160]
Same thing with that bid.

[01:28:47.700 --> 01:28:49.200]
Like sex that ever crumbly in fish.

[01:28:49.720 --> 01:28:51.440]
Although, you know, I don't want too much.

[01:28:51.480 --> 01:28:52.940]
I just like a little bit would be good to start.

[01:28:53.180 --> 01:28:53.820]
Oh, go.

[01:28:54.060 --> 01:28:54.440]
What a place.

[01:28:54.620 --> 01:28:55.340]
Not to what you're weak.

[01:28:55.780 --> 01:28:56.500]
Look at this.

[01:28:56.640 --> 01:28:57.280]
Hi, Alia.

[01:28:58.680 --> 01:29:02.240]
Trucker shot friend of the face with a shotgun for grabbing his butt.

[01:29:03.440 --> 01:29:04.640]
What's his sports thing?

[01:29:04.820 --> 01:29:05.720]
Let me say to you.

[01:29:05.820 --> 01:29:10.440]
When I see a guy put his hand on others guys as baseball's very big for that in football

[01:29:10.440 --> 01:29:13.600]
is what you don't see that in hockey because real men play hockey.

[01:29:13.980 --> 01:29:14.860]
That's a real sport.

[01:29:16.760 --> 01:29:19.820]
But in baseball and football, baseball more than any other.

[01:29:20.680 --> 01:29:22.120]
They pat each other when he asks.

[01:29:22.420 --> 01:29:26.860]
And the manager comes out of the pitching coach comes out to make a pitching change and

[01:29:26.860 --> 01:29:29.240]
he takes the ball from the pitcher and what does he do to Chris?

[01:29:29.240 --> 01:29:32.200]
He pass him on the ass as he leaves the amount.

[01:29:32.460 --> 01:29:32.920]
Am I right?

[01:29:33.260 --> 01:29:33.740]
Yeah, usually.

[01:29:34.320 --> 01:29:36.780]
Almost every time he gets to put his hand on to me that's.

[01:29:36.780 --> 01:29:38.140]
Yeah, I don't care what anybody says.

[01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:39.280]
You just tell him, jealous.

[01:29:40.400 --> 01:29:41.760]
It depends on who the pitcher is.

[01:29:41.820 --> 01:29:43.620]
If it was Justin Thompson, I would have been real jealous.

[01:29:43.960 --> 01:29:44.840]
Whatever happened to him.

[01:29:44.900 --> 01:29:45.340]
Oh, God.

[01:29:45.640 --> 01:29:46.300]
Man, he was cute.

[01:29:47.120 --> 01:29:50.760]
Highly a truck driver killed his friend with a shotgun last week because the man grabbed

[01:29:50.760 --> 01:29:56.060]
his butt-ox in a sexual manner police said, how do you grab your somebody's butt-ox

[01:29:56.060 --> 01:29:59.020]
in a sexual manner as opposed to what other kind of a manner is there?

[01:29:59.020 --> 01:29:59.280]
Yeah.

[01:30:00.620 --> 01:30:01.400]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:30:01.800 --> 01:30:02.100]
Yeah.

[01:30:02.760 --> 01:30:07.160]
What other kind of a way is to grab somebody's ass in a non-sexual way?

[01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:08.300]
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

[01:30:08.480 --> 01:30:08.980]
I don't know.

[01:30:09.140 --> 01:30:10.560]
Maybe your doctor can, but other than that.

[01:30:10.560 --> 01:30:13.200]
Maybe the administration is in order at the Abercrombie in bitch.

[01:30:13.580 --> 01:30:14.700]
Oh, my God.

[01:30:15.260 --> 01:30:16.300]
And I'll take you where else.

[01:30:16.660 --> 01:30:19.580]
And now I don't want to get, you know, side-track from the story.

[01:30:19.660 --> 01:30:20.320]
I'll get back to it.

[01:30:20.900 --> 01:30:25.060]
But how many times do I talk about the fact that Indian guys are like underrated as

[01:30:25.060 --> 01:30:25.680]
far as their looks?

[01:30:25.680 --> 01:30:28.860]
And that's because most people run away because of the career role.

[01:30:28.920 --> 01:30:30.560]
You know, oh, gee, I don't want to look at these people.

[01:30:30.640 --> 01:30:31.300]
They smell like curry.

[01:30:31.380 --> 01:30:32.500]
And that's because it's all they eat.

[01:30:34.260 --> 01:30:36.140]
There was a young man, I would say around 20.

[01:30:36.340 --> 01:30:36.980]
Oh, there he goes again.

[01:30:37.080 --> 01:30:37.740]
It was 20-year-olds.

[01:30:37.780 --> 01:30:38.120]
That's right.

[01:30:38.220 --> 01:30:39.140]
It would buy me yesterday.

[01:30:39.380 --> 01:30:40.060]
Playing with his buddy.

[01:30:40.540 --> 01:30:42.100]
I mean, playing the sauce with his buddy.

[01:30:42.500 --> 01:30:45.020]
In fact, they look like maybe they've been playing together other things.

[01:30:46.900 --> 01:30:50.720]
He was so good-looking that it just penetrated my brain.

[01:30:50.720 --> 01:30:52.060]
That's how handsome he was.

[01:30:52.220 --> 01:30:52.540]
Handsome.

[01:30:52.640 --> 01:30:52.980]
You're brave.

[01:30:53.080 --> 01:30:53.080]

[01:30:53.080 --> 01:30:53.440]
Are you sure I handsome?

[01:30:55.060 --> 01:30:58.520]
Now why is it that Indian men, so many of them are so good-looking, and Indian women,

[01:30:58.680 --> 01:31:02.360]
although not that I pay that much attention, I don't recall ever seeing like too many really

[01:31:02.360 --> 01:31:03.260]
beautiful Indian women.

[01:31:03.380 --> 01:31:03.700]
Am I wrong?

[01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:04.160]
Yes.

[01:31:04.920 --> 01:31:05.460]
I am wrong.

[01:31:05.600 --> 01:31:05.800]
Yes.

[01:31:06.340 --> 01:31:06.980]
Well, there you go.

[01:31:07.880 --> 01:31:08.800]
So I'll leave that to you.

[01:31:08.920 --> 01:31:09.960]
And I'll take with the eyes.

[01:31:10.240 --> 01:31:11.040]
Big beautiful eyes.

[01:31:11.400 --> 01:31:11.640]
Mmm.

[01:31:13.240 --> 01:31:14.220]
I really was tempted.

[01:31:14.420 --> 01:31:16.520]
I mean, not tempted really that I would do it.

[01:31:16.560 --> 01:31:22.320]
But it crosses your mind that you would like to go over and say, you just can't say to

[01:31:22.320 --> 01:31:24.140]
people about how beautiful you are, you know, like that.

[01:31:25.400 --> 01:31:25.680]
Right.

[01:31:26.360 --> 01:31:27.760]
But you can't say that to people.

[01:31:27.800 --> 01:31:30.120]
You can't walk over to a guy and say, man, you are really something else.

[01:31:30.260 --> 01:31:30.500]
That's right.

[01:31:30.640 --> 01:31:32.080]
You're an old bag approaching a guy.

[01:31:33.920 --> 01:31:34.200]
Yeah.

[01:31:35.220 --> 01:31:36.620]
Well, what if I wasn't a little bag?

[01:31:36.720 --> 01:31:38.560]
What if I was a young guy like him and I would have gone over.

[01:31:38.620 --> 01:31:40.060]
He'd probably say, well, that's a boogie, baby.

[01:31:40.580 --> 01:31:42.020]
Well, he was, I think, a little bit of a comb.

[01:31:42.160 --> 01:31:42.460]
But anyway.

[01:31:42.600 --> 01:31:42.740]
Yeah.

[01:31:43.380 --> 01:31:45.420]
Can we get back to this highly-attract driver?

[01:31:45.580 --> 01:31:50.520]
He killed his friend with a shotgun because the man grabbed his buttocks in a sexual manner.

[01:31:50.520 --> 01:31:51.840]
His buttocks.

[01:31:52.900 --> 01:31:56.320]
Rolando Aguilar has been charged with first-degree murder in the death of Omar Feebles.

[01:31:58.100 --> 01:31:58.900]
Where's that Feebles?

[01:31:59.820 --> 01:32:01.400]
FEV LES has got to be Feebles.

[01:32:01.560 --> 01:32:02.380]
Where it can't be Feebles?

[01:32:03.620 --> 01:32:03.860]
Feebles?

[01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:04.380]
What would he mean?

[01:32:04.540 --> 01:32:05.020]
You don't know.

[01:32:05.160 --> 01:32:06.140]
It's got to be his spatic.

[01:32:06.240 --> 01:32:07.320]
It's first of all, it's in Hyal.

[01:32:07.360 --> 01:32:08.480]
His first name is Omar.

[01:32:08.920 --> 01:32:11.160]
And unless he's a tent maker, maybe he's a terrorist, I don't know.

[01:32:11.620 --> 01:32:12.340]
I would say Feebles.

[01:32:13.260 --> 01:32:13.580]
Feebles.

[01:32:13.920 --> 01:32:16.880]
And then what I just said, don't start with that pendejo again, stuff.

[01:32:17.160 --> 01:32:17.560]
I wouldn't.

[01:32:18.120 --> 01:32:22.240]
Highly police at AAR 55 confessed to killing Feebles for the year on the 4th of July.

[01:32:22.440 --> 01:32:23.500]
On Hank's birthday, oh.

[01:32:24.840 --> 01:32:27.660]
According to reported, the heroed Aguilar told police that friends have been drinking

[01:32:27.660 --> 01:32:30.160]
together and decided to stay the night at Aguilar's apartment.

[01:32:30.400 --> 01:32:30.720]
Uh-oh.

[01:32:30.980 --> 01:32:31.760]
Uh-oh.

[01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:32.240]
Uh-oh.

[01:32:32.380 --> 01:32:32.860]
No.

[01:32:34.460 --> 01:32:36.100]
Now we get to the meat of the matter.

[01:32:36.800 --> 01:32:41.640]
The two men were sleeping in the same bed when Feebles woke Aguilar with his sexual

[01:32:41.640 --> 01:32:45.800]
advances, prompting Aguilar to re-tree this shotgun from the closet and shoot Feebles

[01:32:45.800 --> 01:32:47.360]
in the face in the push.

[01:32:48.200 --> 01:32:50.800]
Aguilar then ran to the bathroom to make it look like a burglary, police said.

[01:32:51.460 --> 01:32:52.180]
He killed him dead.

[01:32:53.440 --> 01:32:54.540]
Well, let me ask you this.

[01:32:54.700 --> 01:32:56.120]
Why was he sleeping in the same bed?

[01:32:56.400 --> 01:32:57.640]
Uh, I think they said they were drunk.

[01:32:58.400 --> 01:32:59.240]
Was there what it was?

[01:32:59.860 --> 01:33:00.260]
I'd like to know.

[01:33:00.440 --> 01:33:01.960]
Not drunk enough to rest out in the same way.

[01:33:01.960 --> 01:33:06.020]
Not drunk enough to detect those sexual advances on his back bone buttocks.

[01:33:06.140 --> 01:33:09.660]
Apparently once he detected them, that's when he rejected them.

[01:33:10.100 --> 01:33:10.600]
I see.

[01:33:13.640 --> 01:33:16.560]
Not a good idea to be grabbing some of these buttocks in the middle of the night.

[01:33:16.560 --> 01:33:17.980]
Not unless you ask permission first.

[01:33:18.440 --> 01:33:19.840]
Unless it's somebody you know pretty good.

[01:33:20.120 --> 01:33:20.860]
Get a signed waiver.

[01:33:21.200 --> 01:33:21.200]

[01:33:21.400 --> 01:33:23.200]
You know, notarized with the witness.

[01:33:26.220 --> 01:33:27.960]
There was no mourning at the funeral.

[01:33:28.180 --> 01:33:31.440]
I mean, you knew how to get to the store eventually and were this is so stupid, man.

[01:33:31.680 --> 01:33:32.260]
Oh, please.

[01:33:32.700 --> 01:33:36.060]
It's so typical of the kind of crap that people waste time with in America.

[01:33:36.340 --> 01:33:36.900]
Cracker, please.

[01:33:37.440 --> 01:33:38.880]
Yeah, cracker, please is correct.

[01:33:38.880 --> 01:33:40.560]
Now let's bury the cracker word too.

[01:33:40.700 --> 01:33:41.640]
Can we get out the C word?

[01:33:41.840 --> 01:33:42.000]
Nah.

[01:33:42.960 --> 01:33:46.720]
Maybe we can have a funeral for the C word that Bill Campersof said about the cool word.

[01:33:46.880 --> 01:33:47.000]
Okay.

[01:33:47.380 --> 01:33:48.480]
Haven't heard that in the Koon's age.

[01:33:49.400 --> 01:33:50.320]
Can't say that no more.

[01:33:51.320 --> 01:33:52.280]
What is with him anyway?

[01:33:52.560 --> 01:33:56.140]
Did somebody get to him or did somebody like grab his buttocks too hard in the locker room

[01:33:56.140 --> 01:33:56.420]
sometime?

[01:33:57.420 --> 01:33:58.840]
959 votes on the pool, by the way.

[01:33:58.880 --> 01:34:02.080]
Let's get to a thousand a hour so we don't have to pock you around in that big one to

[01:34:02.080 --> 01:34:02.420]
two hour.

[01:34:03.680 --> 01:34:08.700]
Hundreds of onlookers cheered yesterday as the NAACP put to rest a long standing

[01:34:08.700 --> 01:34:13.440]
expression of racism by holding a public burial for the N word during its annual convention.

[01:34:13.800 --> 01:34:19.740]
Now I'm curious, but I'm looking through this CNN story and nowhere in the story does

[01:34:19.740 --> 01:34:23.520]
it actually say the word because it's put to rest.

[01:34:24.220 --> 01:34:24.800]
Oh, I see.

[01:34:24.900 --> 01:34:25.200]
It's dead.

[01:34:25.740 --> 01:34:27.600]
Oh, we're going to hear it again.

[01:34:27.720 --> 01:34:28.480]
I thought God is dead.

[01:34:29.120 --> 01:34:30.240]
It's out of respect to the word.

[01:34:31.060 --> 01:34:34.900]
The ceremony included a march by delegates from across the country from downtown Detroit's

[01:34:34.900 --> 01:34:39.320]
Cobalt Center to Hart Plaza along the way to horses.

[01:34:39.620 --> 01:34:41.280]
Now what kind of a name word is that?

[01:34:41.540 --> 01:34:43.780]
Persher Ron Horses, P-E-R-C-H-R-O-N.

[01:34:44.260 --> 01:34:44.740]
Never heard of it.

[01:34:45.340 --> 01:34:45.960]
Perch on this.

[01:34:47.100 --> 01:34:48.060]
Two Persher Ron Horses.

[01:34:48.180 --> 01:34:49.080]
I have no idea what that is.

[01:34:49.160 --> 01:34:52.300]
Am I going to pretend that I do because I mean I know a little bit about horses but not

[01:34:52.300 --> 01:34:52.740]
that kind.

[01:34:53.540 --> 01:34:55.720]
In fact, it wouldn't surprise me if I'm the racing network.

[01:34:55.860 --> 01:34:59.380]
There's horses racing running round and round and people losing their money on them.

[01:34:59.480 --> 01:35:02.220]
At the overweights number one, Carol's pick carries three over.

[01:35:02.440 --> 01:35:02.980]
Well, that's good.

[01:35:02.980 --> 01:35:03.880]
But a three pound hoover.

[01:35:03.940 --> 01:35:04.260]
No sweat.

[01:35:04.700 --> 01:35:05.700]
Get off of my air cloud.

[01:35:06.320 --> 01:35:08.060]
Get away from me without horse racing crap.

[01:35:10.800 --> 01:35:15.400]
Anyway, they pulled a pine box at home with a bouquet of fake black roses and a black ribbon

[01:35:15.400 --> 01:35:17.640]
printed with a derivation of the word.

[01:35:18.980 --> 01:35:22.500]
The confidence will be placed at Detroit Memorial Park cemetery will have a headstone.

[01:35:22.780 --> 01:35:23.660]
Oh my God.

[01:35:23.940 --> 01:35:26.260]
Although that's the appropriate place for it though I would think, isn't it?

[01:35:26.660 --> 01:35:27.100]
Indeed, right?

[01:35:27.300 --> 01:35:27.400]
Sure.

[01:35:28.460 --> 01:35:30.260]
Today we're not just bearing the N word.

[01:35:30.260 --> 01:35:33.360]
We're taking out of our spirits at Detroit Mayor Kauami Kilpatrick.

[01:35:33.760 --> 01:35:35.880]
We're bearing all the things that go with the N word.

[01:35:36.040 --> 01:35:38.340]
We have to bury the pimps in the hose that go with it.

[01:35:38.720 --> 01:35:39.080]
Oh, what are they?

[01:35:39.200 --> 01:35:42.360]
I hope they have got a lot of headstones, because there's a lot of pimps in a lot of hose.

[01:35:43.660 --> 01:35:47.420]
He continued, die and word of me don't want to see you around here no more.

[01:35:48.600 --> 01:35:49.420]
That's what he said.

[01:35:51.200 --> 01:35:53.160]
The N word has been used as a slur against black.

[01:35:53.180 --> 01:35:57.140]
From what other centuries says CNN, it remains a simple racism but it's also used by black

[01:35:57.140 --> 01:36:01.040]
when referring to other blacks, especially in comedy routines and rap and hip-hop music.

[01:36:02.560 --> 01:36:05.820]
This was the greatest child that racism ever birthed said the word.

[01:36:05.920 --> 01:36:10.000]
Now that was within A by the way when I just said, does that make it okay if it ends with

[01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:10.240]
an A?

[01:36:10.380 --> 01:36:11.280]
What word did you say?

[01:36:13.460 --> 01:36:15.420]
No, you know what I'm saying, no it's it.

[01:36:16.220 --> 01:36:16.640]
Yes of course.

[01:36:17.020 --> 01:36:18.880]
If it ends in an A then it's okay.

[01:36:19.680 --> 01:36:20.560]
If it ends in E.R.

[01:36:21.740 --> 01:36:22.920]
Did you say what I thought you said?

[01:36:23.080 --> 01:36:24.100]
Don't err by saying that.

[01:36:24.200 --> 01:36:24.420]
Right.

[01:36:25.600 --> 01:36:28.020]
This was the greatest child that racism ever birthed.

[01:36:28.240 --> 01:36:32.280]
Reverend Otis Moss, the turret assistant pastor at Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago

[01:36:32.280 --> 01:36:34.620]
said in his Eulogy, had a eulogy for their word.

[01:36:35.220 --> 01:36:36.900]
Let's bury a bunch of words, okay?

[01:36:37.400 --> 01:36:37.900]
Like work.

[01:36:39.240 --> 01:36:43.140]
Public discussion on the words using increased last year following a tired by a sign-filled

[01:36:43.140 --> 01:36:47.240]
actor Michael Richards who used it repeatedly at an LA comedy club, responding to a Hechler,

[01:36:47.500 --> 01:36:49.420]
he later issued a public apology, too late.

[01:36:50.560 --> 01:36:53.900]
The issue about racially insensitive remarks heated up earlier this year after talk show

[01:36:53.900 --> 01:36:54.880]
host Don, I'm a subscriber.

[01:36:55.400 --> 01:36:58.800]
Black members of the Rutgers University Women's Basketball team as...

[01:37:00.800 --> 01:37:01.240]
As...

[01:37:01.240 --> 01:37:01.880]
That's your cute George.

[01:37:02.720 --> 01:37:03.000]
What?

[01:37:03.540 --> 01:37:04.220]
Oh sorry.

[01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:05.200]
Matthew Edadol.

[01:37:05.980 --> 01:37:10.140]
And WACP National Board Chairman Julian Bond repeated a call during the opening address

[01:37:10.140 --> 01:37:13.180]
on the net for the 98th annual convention which runs through Thursday.

[01:37:13.820 --> 01:37:17.680]
While we're happy to have sent a certain radio cowboy back to his ranch, we ought to hold

[01:37:17.680 --> 01:37:21.220]
ourselves to the same standard bond said, if he can't refer to our woman as hoes then

[01:37:21.220 --> 01:37:21.820]
we shouldn't either.

[01:37:21.820 --> 01:37:22.880]
Lots of good points Julian.

[01:37:23.020 --> 01:37:26.780]
I always liked Julian Bond until he made some comment about sending the cowboy back to

[01:37:26.780 --> 01:37:28.760]
his ranch to his ranch.

[01:37:29.420 --> 01:37:33.340]
Black leaders including the Reverend Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton have challenged the entertainment

[01:37:33.340 --> 01:37:36.760]
industry in American public to stop using the inward and other racial slords.

[01:37:37.040 --> 01:37:40.040]
Well guess what guys, when you stop using it then maybe we will, okay?

[01:37:41.480 --> 01:37:46.260]
The end of the lay held a symbolic funeral in Detroit in 19...

[01:37:46.260 --> 01:37:46.980]
What year is that?

[01:37:47.100 --> 01:37:47.920]
11 for Jim Crow.

[01:37:47.920 --> 01:37:52.340]
The systematic mostly seven practices discrimination against and segregation of blacks from the

[01:37:52.340 --> 01:37:54.460]
end of post-Aboric construction of the mid-20th century.

[01:37:56.060 --> 01:37:57.780]
Can that possibly say 1911?

[01:37:59.660 --> 01:38:00.020]
Maybe.

[01:38:00.560 --> 01:38:00.920]
I don't know.

[01:38:01.060 --> 01:38:01.780]
I can't read this.

[01:38:02.020 --> 01:38:04.220]
So this is one of those typo things you know.

[01:38:04.340 --> 01:38:05.500]
But it makes it always more exciting.

[01:38:05.900 --> 01:38:08.660]
It makes it more of a challenge when you can't read the damn number or the word or stuff

[01:38:08.660 --> 01:38:09.200]
like that.

[01:38:10.320 --> 01:38:13.720]
And now that Miguel isn't around anymore, who am I going to piss off by reading all these

[01:38:14.660 --> 01:38:16.080]
important bedtime stories on it?

[01:38:16.080 --> 01:38:17.240]
Oh he's still listening.

[01:38:18.080 --> 01:38:18.540]
He's still listening.

[01:38:18.540 --> 01:38:18.600]
Is he still listening?

[01:38:18.780 --> 01:38:19.740]
I can't hear that.

[01:38:20.140 --> 01:38:20.560]
Hey, call that.

[01:38:20.640 --> 01:38:20.680]
Hey, call that.

[01:38:20.680 --> 01:38:21.900]
Love you Miguel, we miss you badly.

[01:38:23.520 --> 01:38:27.340]
And you replacement by the way, somebody, now who is it that did it?

[01:38:27.940 --> 01:38:29.300]
Someone in that department.

[01:38:29.580 --> 01:38:31.560]
Someone on the promotions that I'm the only one who's listening.

[01:38:31.740 --> 01:38:33.120]
I hear that he had Miguel would have been there with me.

[01:38:33.120 --> 01:38:33.540]
Not really.

[01:38:34.200 --> 01:38:34.640]
That's right.

[01:38:34.820 --> 01:38:35.060]
Not really.

[01:38:35.220 --> 01:38:37.560]
He's not the only person from other point of view.

[01:38:37.720 --> 01:38:38.620]
Some jerk or a sissy.

[01:38:38.720 --> 01:38:39.380]
Some jackass.

[01:38:39.660 --> 01:38:40.520]
Some don't.

[01:38:41.720 --> 01:38:45.360]
This is Joe Boyle in the voice of the Toronto May beliefs and you're listening to the

[01:38:45.360 --> 01:38:47.360]
hockey authority, Neil God.

[01:38:47.820 --> 01:38:50.660]
Hey everybody, I'm Brown and Brown.

[01:38:51.240 --> 01:38:54.160]
Accountable for everybody, Brown and Brown.

[01:38:54.460 --> 01:38:55.620]
That's a human being.

[01:38:56.140 --> 01:39:01.060]
I'm a big disappointment, but I got a Brown nose and I know it's where I'm on it.

[01:39:01.520 --> 01:39:04.160]
There was no rush to get them saved.

[01:39:04.640 --> 01:39:07.300]
They don't vote Republican anyway.

[01:39:07.860 --> 01:39:14.200]
I did everything I possibly can to show myself home for the clue that's planned.

[01:39:14.200 --> 01:39:17.700]
Oh, what a job I had as a vector of freedom.

[01:39:18.160 --> 01:39:23.780]
When I'm much more than a wiserly skimmer and a clueless son of a bitch.

[01:39:24.340 --> 01:39:24.780]
Absolutely.

[01:39:25.080 --> 01:39:27.860]
It's his gigs, Brown goes in the bridge.

[01:39:28.380 --> 01:39:31.100]
It's his gigs, Brown goes in the bridge.

[01:39:31.680 --> 01:39:34.360]
New Orleans is wiped out in gone.

[01:39:34.920 --> 01:39:39.520]
But W said I did one heck of a job and it sure pays off.

[01:39:39.520 --> 01:39:47.900]
To be a Brownie and another YMASD Christian, Bonnie, the National God is down then down.

[01:39:48.240 --> 01:39:51.200]
We thought it was just to get the press out of town.

[01:39:51.540 --> 01:39:53.000]
Everybody go home.

[01:39:53.420 --> 01:39:54.480]
There's nothing to see.

[01:39:55.100 --> 01:39:57.520]
Everything here is pink-y-pain.

[01:39:58.140 --> 01:40:01.300]
Older hurricane gave us a big EC.

[01:40:01.780 --> 01:40:07.500]
40-year-old consul is je neary like a giant republic in Swingy.

[01:40:07.500 --> 01:40:11.360]
Praise Jesus for our Lord and King.

[01:40:12.020 --> 01:40:14.720]
Praise Jesus for our Lord and King.

[01:40:15.360 --> 01:40:17.960]
How believe compassion's what we elect.

[01:40:18.560 --> 01:40:23.040]
It serves the right to have less blacks and you descend as you say.

[01:40:23.280 --> 01:40:24.740]
It's a national disgrace.

[01:40:25.340 --> 01:40:26.620]
They shouldn't have it black.

[01:40:27.120 --> 01:40:31.420]
In the first place, this is no time to blame the blame game.

[01:40:31.780 --> 01:40:34.820]
Since we know that furry kings are called by kings.

[01:40:34.820 --> 01:40:37.480]
Who are not the right kind of Alma?

[01:40:38.420 --> 01:40:41.200]
Lights caught him at clenin' and caroled.

[01:40:41.200 --> 01:40:44.800]
Well, oh, we're achieving a marriage in right-wing dream.

[01:40:45.400 --> 01:40:48.160]
You make everybody white like me.

[01:40:48.480 --> 01:40:53.200]
And an ignorant son of a bitch who gets his job.

[01:40:53.540 --> 01:40:54.820]
Brown knows a new bitch.

[01:40:55.060 --> 01:40:58.360]
Oh, how I miss getting my new baby in horses.

[01:40:58.900 --> 01:41:01.780]
I'd rather do that than watch floating corpses.

[01:41:01.780 --> 01:41:04.240]
This I'm a negligent murderer now.

[01:41:05.260 --> 01:41:08.340]
And I'll keep going down to keep my nose brown.

[01:41:08.660 --> 01:41:10.940]
I'm a negligent murderer now.

[01:41:11.980 --> 01:41:15.220]
But I'll keep going down to keep my nose brown.

[01:41:15.620 --> 01:41:17.400]
Yeah, he was a bad public official.

[01:41:17.520 --> 01:41:19.260]
He should be executed brownie brown time.

[01:41:19.260 --> 01:41:21.260]
We should take a pegs out of the Chinese book.

[01:41:22.640 --> 01:41:26.060]
China executed the former head of its food and drug watch right on today.

[01:41:26.700 --> 01:41:29.160]
For approving untested medicine and new change for cash,

[01:41:29.160 --> 01:41:33.400]
the strongest signal yet from Beijing that it's serious about tackling its product safety crisis.

[01:41:34.420 --> 01:41:36.800]
If it's made in China, don't eat it.

[01:41:37.140 --> 01:41:37.560]
That's good plan.

[01:41:38.280 --> 01:41:38.780]
Or Mexico.

[01:41:39.160 --> 01:41:42.800]
His execution was confirmed by state TV in the official Shinwai News Agency.

[01:41:43.560 --> 01:41:46.920]
The few corrupt officials of the SFDA are ashamed of the whole system

[01:41:46.920 --> 01:41:49.760]
and their scandals have revealed some very serious problems.

[01:41:49.880 --> 01:41:52.260]
Agency spokeswoman Yan Ying-Yang.

[01:41:52.260 --> 01:41:53.340]
Yan Ying-Yang.

[01:41:53.920 --> 01:41:55.080]
He said a news conference.

[01:41:55.900 --> 01:41:56.820]
That's a surname.

[01:41:57.220 --> 01:41:58.480]
Yan Ying-Yang.

[01:41:59.060 --> 01:41:59.560]
Yan Ying-Yang.

[01:41:59.560 --> 01:41:59.940]
Yan Ying-Yang.

[01:41:59.940 --> 01:42:00.000]
Yan Ying-Yang.

[01:42:00.120 --> 01:42:00.440]
Wing-Ling.

[01:42:00.880 --> 01:42:04.680]
Said a news conference held a highlight efforts to improve China's track record on food and drug safety.

[01:42:04.980 --> 01:42:07.900]
They were embarrassed because they killed your dogs and cats and stuff like that.

[01:42:08.060 --> 01:42:09.260]
And then there were people getting bad toothpaste.

[01:42:09.940 --> 01:42:11.480]
And all of these things.

[01:42:11.480 --> 01:42:12.300]
All of these things.

[01:42:13.160 --> 01:42:13.860]
Tainted toothpaste.

[01:42:14.140 --> 01:42:15.800]
You thought it was toothpaste, but taint what you thought.

[01:42:15.800 --> 01:42:18.620]
I looked up in Wikipedia.

[01:42:19.300 --> 01:42:22.980]
Niga is a term used in African American vernacular English.

[01:42:23.700 --> 01:42:24.580]
Ibonics it says.

[01:42:24.880 --> 01:42:31.520]
Now, why would they dignify Ibonics as if it was like seeing them using it?

[01:42:31.580 --> 01:42:32.900]
They need to call it something.

[01:42:33.120 --> 01:42:34.740]
The teacher needed to call the...

[01:42:34.740 --> 01:42:35.860]
How about the literature?

[01:42:36.120 --> 01:42:37.500]
See, they couldn't say that.

[01:42:37.540 --> 01:42:37.800]
How about illiterate?

[01:42:38.560 --> 01:42:39.260]
We know what that is.

[01:42:39.400 --> 01:42:40.160]
Listen, wink, wink.

[01:42:40.500 --> 01:42:41.040]
Come over here.

[01:42:41.300 --> 01:42:42.580]
We're going to tell you a secret.

[01:42:42.580 --> 01:42:47.200]
We can't tell these kids that mommy and dad are your bunch of ignorance that don't talk right.

[01:42:47.340 --> 01:42:48.860]
So we've got to call it something.

[01:42:49.320 --> 01:42:50.920]
We've got to call it something.

[01:42:51.080 --> 01:42:54.540]
Ignites that won't offend them so that we can teach them to have not speak.

[01:42:54.660 --> 01:42:55.400]
We call it bubba.

[01:42:55.760 --> 01:42:57.560]
Everybody misinterpreted that as a whole thing.

[01:42:58.020 --> 01:42:58.580]
It's a real play.

[01:42:58.580 --> 01:43:00.200]
Yeah, but you've got to call it something.

[01:43:01.080 --> 01:43:01.960]
I like that.

[01:43:02.100 --> 01:43:02.900]
The Ibonic play.

[01:43:03.980 --> 01:43:10.440]
Anyway, it's an African American vernacular English that began as an idol like form of the word and then it's got the inward type of it or not.

[01:43:10.880 --> 01:43:15.980]
Which is derived ultimately from the Latin word, knee, knee.

[01:43:16.440 --> 01:43:21.460]
See, I don't know how you would say that in Latin because you wouldn't say a G wouldn't be knee-jerk like in the...

[01:43:21.460 --> 01:43:24.300]
You know, they'd like to say to the Italian or Spanish men.

[01:43:25.940 --> 01:43:27.360]
Meaning the color black.

[01:43:27.720 --> 01:43:28.340]
They'd go black.

[01:43:29.580 --> 01:43:29.980]
Knees.

[01:43:30.520 --> 01:43:31.540]
I don't know how you say it.

[01:43:32.760 --> 01:43:33.380]
In Latin.

[01:43:34.500 --> 01:43:38.500]
I mean, I had three years of Latin and I conduct my math and I was a result.

[01:43:38.920 --> 01:43:39.360]
How was it spelled?

[01:43:39.360 --> 01:43:40.400]
N-I-G-E-R.

[01:43:41.580 --> 01:43:42.740]
N-I-G-E-R.

[01:43:43.300 --> 01:43:43.420]
Right.

[01:43:43.900 --> 01:43:44.300]
N-G-E-R.

[01:43:45.260 --> 01:43:46.140]
I beg your pardon?

[01:43:47.680 --> 01:43:48.180]
N-G-L.

[01:43:50.480 --> 01:43:51.740]
And then you write this for me.

[01:43:51.820 --> 01:43:52.740]
And me and the color black.

[01:43:53.160 --> 01:43:54.320]
So it's like, it's just like...

[01:43:54.320 --> 01:43:55.960]
It just means you notice all these things going on.

[01:43:56.320 --> 01:43:57.160]
It's like schwarz.

[01:43:57.780 --> 01:43:57.920]
Right.

[01:43:58.380 --> 01:44:00.660]
Schwarz in German and in English means black.

[01:44:01.860 --> 01:44:03.220]
Schwarz here means a person.

[01:44:03.360 --> 01:44:04.500]
I've worked through this a million times.

[01:44:04.740 --> 01:44:06.240]
And of course Moe used to get all that.

[01:44:06.240 --> 01:44:07.500]
And then you go under the guise of stick.

[01:44:07.620 --> 01:44:09.240]
He's saying things you ought to have a bullet in the brain.

[01:44:09.680 --> 01:44:10.400]
What's wrong with that?

[01:44:11.020 --> 01:44:13.740]
There is nothing derogatory about the word in and of itself.

[01:44:13.880 --> 01:44:15.360]
Other depending on the usage, okay?

[01:44:15.940 --> 01:44:16.140]
Right.

[01:44:16.920 --> 01:44:17.720]
It's like Jew.

[01:44:18.180 --> 01:44:19.100]
You know, I'm a Jew.

[01:44:19.860 --> 01:44:21.580]
If you said you're a Jew bastard.

[01:44:23.460 --> 01:44:25.340]
It might be a derogatory, you know what I'm saying?

[01:44:25.660 --> 01:44:25.820]
Right.

[01:44:26.160 --> 01:44:27.560]
Or if you said you damn Jew.

[01:44:28.660 --> 01:44:30.420]
You mocky Jew, kite bastard.

[01:44:30.600 --> 01:44:31.020]
And he said that.

[01:44:31.120 --> 01:44:32.280]
It might be slightly derogatory.

[01:44:32.580 --> 01:44:33.740]
And I might take Umbridge with that.

[01:44:33.740 --> 01:44:35.720]
Even though of course I'm not really interested in any of the bubbling mice.

[01:44:35.720 --> 01:44:37.800]
These were the trapping except the Adeli, you know?

[01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:38.560]
I do like the Dile.

[01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:40.100]
I like my cheese mice.

[01:44:40.340 --> 01:44:40.620]
Sure.

[01:44:41.440 --> 01:44:42.420]
What are you playing?

[01:44:42.580 --> 01:44:43.220]
What is that crap?

[01:44:43.940 --> 01:44:44.260]
DMX.

[01:44:44.760 --> 01:44:45.400]
What is this?

[01:44:45.520 --> 01:44:46.120]
It's DMX.

[01:44:46.500 --> 01:44:47.320]
He likes that word.

[01:44:47.420 --> 01:44:49.000]
He uses it a lot and he's entitled to.

[01:44:49.220 --> 01:44:50.140]
So we don't want to hear him.

[01:44:50.280 --> 01:44:51.600]
We don't want to put that word on the ear.

[01:44:52.440 --> 01:44:53.580]
You crazy or what?

[01:44:53.880 --> 01:44:54.000]
What?

[01:44:54.120 --> 01:44:55.860]
Next to be playing that nappy headed hose thing.

[01:44:56.260 --> 01:44:58.300]
Nappy, nappy, nappy, nappy headed hose.

[01:44:59.420 --> 01:45:01.380]
987 votes on the pole rhymes with hope.

[01:45:02.540 --> 01:45:04.000]
I mean it's all part of it.

[01:45:04.120 --> 01:45:04.900]
Well, I don't want to go in.

[01:45:04.900 --> 01:45:05.500]
I don't want to go in.

[01:45:05.560 --> 01:45:06.300]
How do you get me solid?

[01:45:06.300 --> 01:45:07.920]
That's because of the funeral for the end word, you know?

[01:45:08.020 --> 01:45:08.340]
That's right.

[01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:09.880]
I didn't play that.

[01:45:10.860 --> 01:45:11.900]
I had nothing to do with it.

[01:45:12.120 --> 01:45:13.040]
I seen it on the news.

[01:45:13.180 --> 01:45:17.560]
And of course I saw that story there and I figured you know you'd be really depressed if I didn't cover it with a blanket.

[01:45:17.820 --> 01:45:18.080]
That's right.

[01:45:18.240 --> 01:45:19.240]
I mentioned it.

[01:45:19.380 --> 01:45:22.340]
Well, we're sure that Bob Barker and Richie have hung up their microphones.

[01:45:23.800 --> 01:45:28.440]
What other old cout or broadcast legends should seriously consider hanging it up?

[01:45:29.920 --> 01:45:30.540]
Larry King.

[01:45:31.500 --> 01:45:32.200]
291 votes.

[01:45:32.200 --> 01:45:33.940]
He's been leading from the get-go as they say.

[01:45:34.360 --> 01:45:36.200]
And he's just crushing the competition here.

[01:45:37.180 --> 01:45:38.440]
Andy Rune 153.

[01:45:38.960 --> 01:45:39.340]
Paul Harvey.

[01:45:39.700 --> 01:45:40.160]
Good day.

[01:45:40.940 --> 01:45:41.320]
142.

[01:45:42.680 --> 01:45:43.240]
Barbara Walters.

[01:45:43.540 --> 01:45:43.920]
97.

[01:45:44.200 --> 01:45:48.020]
See, if Andy Rune and Paul Harvey are 88 and they're still on the year and still making a lot of money,

[01:45:48.320 --> 01:45:49.920]
then how come I can't be on till I'm 88?

[01:45:50.340 --> 01:45:50.880]
That would be great.

[01:45:51.500 --> 01:45:52.800]
That would be another 24 years.

[01:45:53.120 --> 01:45:55.540]
By that time Chris would be like an old man and George would be like Methuselah.

[01:45:56.880 --> 01:45:57.000]
Right?

[01:45:58.560 --> 01:45:59.220]
Paul Harvey.

[01:45:59.520 --> 01:45:59.900]
142.

[01:45:59.900 --> 01:46:03.240]
So those three who got the big numbers, after that it's kind of like small taters.

[01:46:03.540 --> 01:46:04.860]
Barbara Walters got 97.

[01:46:05.480 --> 01:46:06.760]
Regis Philbin 72.

[01:46:07.080 --> 01:46:07.640]
The Humper.

[01:46:07.900 --> 01:46:09.040]
Hank Goldberg 68.

[01:46:09.400 --> 01:46:10.620]
Neil Rogers only 51.

[01:46:10.980 --> 01:46:11.940]
Hank's got me by 17.

[01:46:12.560 --> 01:46:14.380]
By 2.5 years and by 17 votes.

[01:46:16.060 --> 01:46:17.280]
G Gordon Litty 49.

[01:46:17.780 --> 01:46:18.680]
Roger Ebert.

[01:46:18.820 --> 01:46:20.660]
We apologize to what's left of him 20.

[01:46:22.020 --> 01:46:22.560]
What is that?

[01:46:22.680 --> 01:46:24.120]
Is that something you're playing or what is that?

[01:46:24.420 --> 01:46:24.880]
I'm not playing that.

[01:46:25.540 --> 01:46:26.600]
What does that sound?

[01:46:26.720 --> 01:46:27.420]
Or something outside?

[01:46:27.420 --> 01:46:29.400]
Well a lot of sounds out here today.

[01:46:30.500 --> 01:46:31.420]
Roger Ebert's got 20.

[01:46:31.620 --> 01:46:32.740]
Keith Jackson's got 19.

[01:46:33.080 --> 01:46:35.100]
Are you sure that he's actually still doing stuff Chris?

[01:46:36.020 --> 01:46:36.880]
I don't know.

[01:46:36.880 --> 01:46:37.600]
I said I don't know.

[01:46:37.740 --> 01:46:38.100]
Keith Jackson.

[01:46:38.100 --> 01:46:39.980]
That's I knew he was doing West Coast stuff.

[01:46:40.360 --> 01:46:41.240]
Nooo, Nelly.

[01:46:42.320 --> 01:46:43.880]
Tom McLaughlin's got 17 votes.

[01:46:44.040 --> 01:46:45.800]
And the more safer he's the move in a very slightly,

[01:46:46.220 --> 01:46:47.620]
he's got 8 out of 990,

[01:46:47.640 --> 01:46:48.620]
which means after the break,

[01:46:48.960 --> 01:46:50.140]
we'll have your 1000 votes.

[01:46:50.940 --> 01:46:54.800]
This is G Gordon Litty and they don't come any worse than Neil Rogers.

[01:47:05.760 --> 01:47:08.020]
I took your calls to date Monix.

[01:47:09.040 --> 01:47:11.260]
They say the future beat right for me.

[01:47:11.800 --> 01:47:13.360]
Now again, it gets no job.

[01:47:13.880 --> 01:47:16.120]
Because I don't got no literacy.

[01:47:17.160 --> 01:47:18.980]
I was talking like an old me growing.

[01:47:19.680 --> 01:47:21.960]
The Monix thought they had this way.

[01:47:22.520 --> 01:47:24.120]
Now I can't do nothing.

[01:47:24.720 --> 01:47:24.780]
I'm not going to be a good boy.

[01:47:24.780 --> 01:47:24.780]

[01:47:24.780 --> 01:47:24.780]

[01:47:24.780 --> 01:47:27.120]
But my heritage says that's OK.

[01:47:27.920 --> 01:47:30.040]
Change my name to Chute Rowan.

[01:47:30.220 --> 01:47:32.760]
Drive a Duke Senicoda in a Cadillac.

[01:47:36.420 --> 01:47:40.620]
I remember when I was stealing all the white men's cars,

[01:47:41.080 --> 01:47:43.220]
hanging outside the building there bar,

[01:47:43.600 --> 01:47:45.480]
grinding the blues out poverty.

[01:47:46.180 --> 01:47:49.980]
White Dillers got snowed, y'all foesy and high, high.

[01:47:50.680 --> 01:47:55.440]
Though the Monix will give my life a change now, high, high.

[01:47:55.860 --> 01:47:58.260]
Got to go in and sell more crack cocaine.

[01:47:59.160 --> 01:48:04.560]
Crack cocaine, crack cocaine, crack cocaine, crack cocaine.

[01:48:04.680 --> 01:48:10.760]
Crack cocaine, crack cocaine, crack cocaine, crack cocaine.

[01:48:13.880 --> 01:48:15.760]
Litty would have bought it in the song.

[01:48:19.180 --> 01:48:20.980]
Robotics makes me sound funny.

[01:48:21.280 --> 01:48:23.640]
Got nothing to do with literacy.

[01:48:24.420 --> 01:48:26.100]
Now I got to make more money.

[01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.160]
They've a fool, sounds good to me.

[01:48:29.700 --> 01:48:31.380]
I got plenty of nothing.

[01:48:32.200 --> 01:48:34.300]
Robotics ain't getting me anywhere.

[01:48:34.980 --> 01:48:39.640]
Maybe I'll mug an old white bitch, steal a purse and pull her hair.

[01:48:40.220 --> 01:48:41.880]
Then I'm going to take some money.

[01:48:41.880 --> 01:48:42.160]
I'm gonna give it my life a day,

[01:48:42.160 --> 01:48:44.680]
but it's very old and fridge-y.

[01:48:48.580 --> 01:48:52.880]
I remember when I was stealing all the white men's cars,

[01:48:53.380 --> 01:48:55.480]
hanging outside the building there bar,

[01:48:55.840 --> 01:48:57.780]
grinding the blues out poverty.

[01:48:58.560 --> 01:49:02.180]
White Dillers got snowed, y'all foesy and high, high.

[01:49:03.140 --> 01:49:06.000]
Though the Monix will give my life a change now.

[01:49:07.880 --> 01:49:35.980]
Cuts to go with their moe crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack cocaine crack

[01:50:34.160 --> 01:50:38.340]
I try to call it, keep my phone in, I pull it

[01:50:39.160 --> 01:50:46.360]
Now try your little quick fuck, fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck

We keep on it's been

[01:51:04.980 --> 01:51:08.000]
1235 at 560 WTQA, I want to get this straight now

[01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:11.800]
According to the urban dictionary, there are 20 different definitions for the word pendejo

[01:51:11.800 --> 01:51:12.780]
Alright

[01:51:12.780 --> 01:51:18.360]
Now remember we were talking before the show today about the difference between Spanish words and Mexican

[01:51:18.360 --> 01:51:20.460]
All the languages have their own distinctions

[01:51:21.700 --> 01:51:26.480]
Number one, pendejo is a Spanish slang from idiot, stupid or dumbass

[01:51:28.060 --> 01:51:31.640]
Right, a two, pendejo is a single pubic here

[01:51:31.640 --> 01:51:35.640]
That's right, that's the Cuban technical definition, but still it's used as a dumbass

[01:51:36.180 --> 01:51:37.580]
Can I continue reading that?

[01:51:37.580 --> 01:51:42.800]
Yes, you must, I mean, do I, I guess I don't really need to read any of this if you have the definitive answer

[01:51:42.800 --> 01:51:44.400]
No, just a commenting as you go

[01:51:45.040 --> 01:51:52.760]
In Mexico's slang it's used as an insult like idiot or fool, but in Peru's slang it's used to describe a smart guy with few or no scruples

[01:51:53.900 --> 01:51:54.300]
Okay

[01:51:55.380 --> 01:51:57.720]
Definition three, Spanish slang for A-hole

[01:52:00.540 --> 01:52:04.440]
For Pendejo is Spanish slang, oh I see, well why do they have it there twice?

[01:52:05.060 --> 01:52:05.720]
Oh I see

[01:52:07.360 --> 01:52:09.340]
I'm EO to Add Esun Pendejo

[01:52:10.920 --> 01:52:11.400]
Okay

[01:52:11.400 --> 01:52:13.720]
But there is this jerk, doesn't say

[01:52:13.720 --> 01:52:14.060]
Right

[01:52:14.060 --> 01:52:15.520]
To Add Esun Pendejo Pedro

[01:52:18.720 --> 01:52:19.200]
Okay

[01:52:19.200 --> 01:52:24.600]
Number five, on the West side of San Antonio, Texas, I discovered that Pendejo means more than just stupid

[01:52:24.600 --> 01:52:29.660]
Which is what I had been told, the connotation on the West side had more to do with being called an effing idiot

[01:52:30.360 --> 01:52:36.060]
Naturally, this was not taken to well, requires some fancy explaining you get out of text-mix slang is tricky stuff

[01:52:36.760 --> 01:52:38.920]
I like that on the West side of San Antonio

[01:52:40.220 --> 01:52:44.100]
Numerous states, dumbass can be used as a term of indirma, I guess it says

[01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.360]
Orale? Oh no, I'm not reading that word

[01:52:47.360 --> 01:52:49.460]
No, what are they?

[01:52:49.900 --> 01:52:54.960]
No, I'm the word I've heard before, the show today begins with the pen, you said you don't know the word, I'm not reading it

[01:52:54.960 --> 01:52:56.460]
Okay, okay

[01:52:57.200 --> 01:52:59.780]
It's not something you're lost sometimes you give them a little pinch

[01:52:59.780 --> 01:53:02.960]
But anyway, Pendejo is a human here

[01:53:03.560 --> 01:53:09.920]
For human people it is used to describe somebody who is cowardly or is a whoos

[01:53:10.440 --> 01:53:12.100]
It's a whole P word, I can't read it

[01:53:12.100 --> 01:53:15.320]
Pubes are always hidden and that's where the meaning comes from, it's there

[01:53:15.320 --> 01:53:15.720]
I see

[01:53:16.460 --> 01:53:18.420]
No, say as Tampendejo Alex

[01:53:19.580 --> 01:53:24.860]
See, Tagusta a lot of Muchacha and something cool in that, I can't read it

[01:53:24.860 --> 01:53:25.980]
I can't read

[01:53:25.980 --> 01:53:26.880]
All right

[01:53:27.960 --> 01:53:30.640]
Spanish slang with different meanings depending on the context

[01:53:30.640 --> 01:53:32.900]
Can mean a whole or dumbass

[01:53:32.900 --> 01:53:37.880]
Much less severe than English cuss words can be used as a casual insult

[01:53:37.880 --> 01:53:40.200]
Depending on the context in which is used

[01:53:40.720 --> 01:53:43.280]
Casual insult or whatever, let's see

[01:53:44.520 --> 01:53:48.580]
I hate profusely a bit of you with it, that's older than you are, okay that bit, but you're right, it is good

[01:53:49.780 --> 01:53:51.400]
He's all whipped up today, you want to know why?

[01:53:51.640 --> 01:53:51.940]
Why?

[01:53:52.360 --> 01:53:53.080]
I can't say it

[01:53:53.080 --> 01:53:54.920]
All right, to begin aversary day

[01:53:55.440 --> 01:53:56.420]
It's good for him

[01:53:56.420 --> 01:53:57.260]
It's okay

[01:53:57.260 --> 01:53:58.280]
No, good for us

[01:53:59.420 --> 01:54:04.600]
Pendejo can be a term of endearmate but it can also be used as an insult depending on who you say it to

[01:54:04.600 --> 01:54:07.380]
Very similar to the use of the N word, aha

[01:54:07.380 --> 01:54:10.280]
To a friend, what's up Pendejo?

[01:54:10.340 --> 01:54:12.400]
Pendejo, a similar to the how you doing?

[01:54:13.120 --> 01:54:19.300]
To a stranger, what's up when the Pendejo is similar to what's something you a whole, aha I say

[01:54:20.160 --> 01:54:21.220]
How do you like that?

[01:54:21.940 --> 01:54:23.600]
So again it has to do with intent

[01:54:24.640 --> 01:54:27.160]
A single tube of care especially around the bubble

[01:54:27.660 --> 01:54:31.980]
Really though, and now we get back to Cuban again and if it's Cuban you know it has to do with ass

[01:54:31.980 --> 01:54:34.380]
You know that, let me ask you about that

[01:54:34.820 --> 01:54:36.280]
I guess you know all about it

[01:54:36.280 --> 01:54:42.920]
And it says a person is referred to as such because he shows himself to be schmid on, wow

[01:54:43.760 --> 01:54:45.000]
How do you like that?

[01:54:46.440 --> 01:54:46.840]
Literally a big deal

[01:54:46.840 --> 01:54:48.620]
Estetipo es un Pendejo

[01:54:49.260 --> 01:54:50.660]
And what does that mean?

[01:54:51.900 --> 01:54:53.060]
Everyone I want to know

[01:54:53.060 --> 01:54:54.780]
He allows himself to be a crap ton

[01:54:54.780 --> 01:54:56.080]
Is that what that means?

[01:54:56.720 --> 01:54:59.040]
That's one of the applications there, yeah

[01:54:59.040 --> 01:54:59.760]
A schmid

[01:54:59.760 --> 01:55:04.600]
A Hispanic A-hole can be used as a term of endearmate

[01:55:04.600 --> 01:55:08.360]
Yo Pendejo, Nise Mags, what does that mean?

[01:55:09.360 --> 01:55:10.040]
I don't know that one

[01:55:10.040 --> 01:55:12.260]
Oh, I don't think you know any Spanish

[01:55:12.260 --> 01:55:15.660]
Nope, in Argentina usually a young person

[01:55:16.340 --> 01:55:19.440]
Estes un Pendejo tiene dos años

[01:55:20.520 --> 01:55:21.980]
So what does that mean?

[01:55:22.200 --> 01:55:26.300]
Oh it's so not fly in the Spanish circles I'm familiar with

[01:55:26.300 --> 01:55:29.880]
So I can't use my Mexicans and Jicanos for A-hole

[01:55:29.880 --> 01:55:35.360]
In Puerto Rican means Wuss, Sissy, Bitch, or Wimp

[01:55:35.960 --> 01:55:37.020]
Boy this is good

[01:55:37.020 --> 01:55:39.160]
I like words with 20 different meaning

[01:55:39.160 --> 01:55:41.060]
Sure, you're always going to get in trouble with those

[01:55:41.060 --> 01:55:45.720]
Upon further investigation I discovered that a Pendejo is literally a single pubic here

[01:55:45.720 --> 01:55:47.900]
Used to describe someone of low value

[01:55:47.900 --> 01:55:50.740]
Maybe used as a term of endearmate among chums

[01:55:50.740 --> 01:55:54.640]
Yo Pendejo, get off my sister

[01:55:57.560 --> 01:55:58.120]
Wow

[01:55:59.940 --> 01:56:02.340]
I've heard of my cloud but get off my sister

[01:56:02.340 --> 01:56:03.820]
That's a little another category

[01:56:04.860 --> 01:56:06.920]
Pendejo means moron in Spanish

[01:56:09.200 --> 01:56:11.040]
A sucker or stupid idiot

[01:56:11.840 --> 01:56:13.700]
Number 19, similar to all the rest

[01:56:13.700 --> 01:56:15.900]
More like someone who is a Wuss

[01:56:15.900 --> 01:56:18.400]
And against got the P word but we better not say that

[01:56:18.400 --> 01:56:19.520]
Or even make those sounds

[01:56:21.340 --> 01:56:24.420]
And last and certainly least in New Mexicans slang

[01:56:24.420 --> 01:56:26.580]
Pendejo means cop

[01:56:27.860 --> 01:56:28.300]
Cop

[01:56:28.300 --> 01:56:29.240]
Pendejo, huh?

[01:56:29.940 --> 01:56:30.780]
As in police

[01:56:31.420 --> 01:56:33.360]
Pendejo fact we are as in police station

[01:56:33.360 --> 01:56:33.700]
Huh

[01:56:34.140 --> 01:56:35.740]
In Mexico, I don't know what that is

[01:56:35.740 --> 01:56:38.300]
That reflects their attitude towards law enforcement I suppose

[01:56:38.300 --> 01:56:38.820]
Wow

[01:56:39.320 --> 01:56:42.560]
And speaking of Pendejo, Bill O'Reilly is off here in Washington DC

[01:56:42.560 --> 01:56:44.540]
You know that they took him off the air on a radio?

[01:56:44.760 --> 01:56:45.280]
I did not know

[01:56:45.760 --> 01:56:47.280]
Lost his affiliate in DC

[01:56:47.280 --> 01:56:49.820]
What a shame I got him in a column by Steve Young about that

[01:56:49.820 --> 01:56:52.320]
And of course in Miami Mark, he's still got a point

[01:56:52.320 --> 01:56:56.060]
He has never moved the Richter scale kind of like man

[01:56:56.060 --> 01:56:56.660]
Cali, you know?

[01:56:57.740 --> 01:56:59.680]
When you've got a number in a book that starts with a

[01:56:59.680 --> 01:57:02.380]
You've got Sirus Baby that means ain't nobody listening

[01:57:02.380 --> 01:57:02.700]
You know?

[01:57:04.620 --> 01:57:07.540]
Kind of like we had in that last book from 11 o'clock at night till midnight

[01:57:07.540 --> 01:57:09.160]
When we had those, what do we have on?

[01:57:09.260 --> 01:57:10.060]
O ESPN radio

[01:57:10.400 --> 01:57:11.840]
Which at least they pushed back till

[01:57:11.840 --> 01:57:14.060]
Well like tonight we got it on after the All-Star game

[01:57:14.700 --> 01:57:16.700]
Because we know nobody is going to be listening to the All-Star game

[01:57:16.700 --> 01:57:19.320]
Who would be listening to it on the radio when it's on free TV

[01:57:19.320 --> 01:57:20.980]
And everybody is at home by that all right?

[01:57:20.980 --> 01:57:22.100]
People drive it around

[01:57:22.740 --> 01:57:24.600]
Who's going to be driving around between eight midnight?

[01:57:24.800 --> 01:57:26.180]
And unless they're going to the police concert

[01:57:27.220 --> 01:57:27.860]
You going?

[01:57:28.140 --> 01:57:28.860]
A wish

[01:57:28.860 --> 01:57:30.340]
And anybody got tickets I want to go

[01:57:31.020 --> 01:57:32.680]
No you know that's something you might enjoy

[01:57:32.680 --> 01:57:35.600]
I would enjoy it and I was not able to tell you in the building

[01:57:35.600 --> 01:57:36.380]
Hook you up for that

[01:57:36.380 --> 01:57:36.980]
In the building

[01:57:37.860 --> 01:57:38.260]
Yeah

[01:57:38.260 --> 01:57:39.160]
I was about to say

[01:57:39.160 --> 01:57:39.960]
I was about to say

[01:57:39.960 --> 01:57:40.220]
I was about to say

[01:57:40.220 --> 01:57:43.020]
I don't think that's their thing

[01:57:43.020 --> 01:57:43.980]
That's not their bag

[01:57:43.980 --> 01:57:44.540]
That's the police

[01:57:44.540 --> 01:57:45.680]
They're not playing Roxanne

[01:57:46.100 --> 01:57:46.500]
No

[01:57:47.280 --> 01:57:48.400]
Intervie death you make?

[01:57:48.820 --> 01:57:49.060]
No

[01:57:49.060 --> 01:57:50.980]
That's one of my favorite all-time songs

[01:57:50.980 --> 01:57:51.780]
Every breath you take

[01:57:51.780 --> 01:57:53.720]
I know we have discussed this in the past

[01:57:53.720 --> 01:57:54.880]
I know you don't like that

[01:57:54.880 --> 01:57:56.180]
I like it fine

[01:57:56.180 --> 01:57:57.280]
They overplayed it to hell

[01:57:57.280 --> 01:57:57.880]
But what?

[01:57:57.940 --> 01:57:59.240]
Oh here we go with overplayed again

[01:57:59.240 --> 01:58:00.160]
See here you go

[01:58:00.160 --> 01:58:01.580]
That's got under the under the square now

[01:58:01.580 --> 01:58:02.060]
It's like that

[01:58:04.380 --> 01:58:04.780]
Yeah

[01:58:04.780 --> 01:58:08.840]
See that overplayed business is I think over-stated over-done

[01:58:09.540 --> 01:58:09.940]
Nevertheless

[01:58:09.940 --> 01:58:11.220]
This song is so beautiful

[01:58:11.220 --> 01:58:12.820]
I liked it before I got tired of it

[01:58:12.820 --> 01:58:13.900]
I get chills from it

[01:58:13.900 --> 01:58:14.360]
Yeah

[01:58:14.360 --> 01:58:15.780]
You liked it before you hated it?

[01:58:15.920 --> 01:58:16.400]
Like the war

[01:58:16.840 --> 01:58:18.660]
You were forward before you were against it

[01:58:18.660 --> 01:58:19.520]
Is that how it was?

[01:58:19.520 --> 01:58:19.920]
Right

[01:58:19.920 --> 01:58:21.020]
It's nothing like

[01:58:22.160 --> 01:58:23.040]
Like that

[01:58:25.580 --> 01:58:28.080]
You got a thousand four harts on the floor by the way Chris

[01:58:28.080 --> 01:58:31.620]
I noticed that you'd Chris is kicking up a new style now

[01:58:32.260 --> 01:58:32.700]
Exactly

[01:58:32.700 --> 01:58:34.020]
I'll run the control room

[01:58:35.040 --> 01:58:36.360]
If you're not doing it

[01:58:36.360 --> 01:58:38.680]
Get some exercise you cow you will do it

[01:58:38.680 --> 01:58:40.720]
Tell him to stay alive for Chris' sake

[01:58:42.740 --> 01:58:44.660]
Are we gonna like play the police instead of

[01:58:44.660 --> 01:58:45.360]
Why not break her wire?

[01:58:45.860 --> 01:58:47.560]
We can do the break anytime you want

[01:58:47.560 --> 01:58:49.680]
Sing of Michael Jackson

[01:58:50.280 --> 01:58:52.220]
Talked to Katie Holmes and Whitney

[01:58:52.220 --> 01:58:54.060]
He's just in the long battle with crack

[01:58:55.320 --> 01:58:58.840]
Sick of me hearing Paris' silken voice

[01:58:58.840 --> 01:59:01.740]
And how Jeff will take Brad back

[01:59:02.780 --> 01:59:05.100]
Sick of the Olsen twins

[01:59:05.100 --> 01:59:07.860]
And here in Lindsay Lowe will ask so much

[01:59:07.860 --> 01:59:09.400]
Wait she's not just bones

[01:59:10.520 --> 01:59:13.740]
Don't want to hear about Ben at Black

[01:59:13.740 --> 01:59:16.880]
Or when Russell Frost starts throwing bones

[01:59:16.880 --> 01:59:23.480]
Those don't so let parentheses are always in trouble

[01:59:23.480 --> 01:59:26.020]
Katie's still the end of scene

[01:59:26.740 --> 01:59:31.380]
Always on the cover of the tabloid

[01:59:32.940 --> 01:59:36.120]
Magazine's I've got my own problems

[01:59:36.120 --> 01:59:41.140]
I don't give a damn in Jessica's the mid-nick

[01:59:42.140 --> 01:59:47.000]
All what knew what big shit it flicks and deep things

[01:59:48.900 --> 01:59:51.160]
Sick of seeing Britney

[01:59:51.160 --> 01:59:55.720]
Then be more Cameron D as her boyfriend Justin Timberlake

[01:59:55.720 --> 02:00:00.320]
All along that mob plastic wonder voice

[02:00:00.320 --> 02:00:03.100]
And all of their boobs are fake

[02:00:04.100 --> 02:00:06.080]
Tired of Mariah

[02:00:06.080 --> 02:00:10.680]
Britney's a wager terror reed of Bret and Hillary Buff

[02:00:10.680 --> 02:00:15.460]
Sick of hearing Demo Beliegg

[02:00:15.460 --> 02:00:18.400]
Shut your mouth I've had it nuts enough

[02:00:18.400 --> 02:00:24.860]
Those don't so let parentheses are always in trouble

[02:00:24.860 --> 02:00:27.420]
Katie's still the end of scene

[02:00:28.080 --> 02:00:32.780]
Always on the cover of the tabloid

[02:00:34.320 --> 02:00:37.520]
Magazine's I've got my own problems

[02:00:37.520 --> 02:00:40.880]
I don't give a damn in Kirstie

[02:00:40.880 --> 02:00:42.540]
All he loses weight

[02:00:42.540 --> 02:00:48.300]
Or crazy or he loves current mental state

[02:00:49.800 --> 02:00:53.660]
Drugs and you know and why don't you start off

[02:00:53.660 --> 02:00:57.920]
Actually with my first appearance back here on your show in three years

[02:00:57.920 --> 02:01:02.440]
And maybe apologize to me for saying that three years ago

[02:01:02.440 --> 02:01:05.500]
Because it turned out everything I said in fair night was true

[02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:10.360]
Everything's come to happen everything I said I mean I was I took you in that film

[02:01:10.360 --> 02:01:15.460]
To Walter Reed Hospital in it took three years before you were any of the rest of the mainstream media

[02:01:15.460 --> 02:01:18.300]
Would go to Walter Reed Hospital and see what was happening to our troops

[02:01:18.300 --> 02:01:23.820]
So for me to have to sit here and listen again to a more crap about socialized medicine

[02:01:23.820 --> 02:01:28.360]
Or how the Canadians have it you know worse than us and all this all the statistics show

[02:01:28.360 --> 02:01:33.520]
That we have a far worse health care than these other industrialized countries

[02:01:33.520 --> 02:01:36.940]
Were the only ones that don't have it free and universal

[02:01:36.940 --> 02:01:44.860]
And you know there's a there's a you said that the Germany was the only one that was better than us in terms of weight times

[02:01:44.860 --> 02:01:48.720]
The Commonwealth fund last year showed of the top six countries

[02:01:48.720 --> 02:01:51.740]
We were second to last next to Canada

[02:01:51.740 --> 02:01:54.860]
Look I saw the film and and it's a powerful

[02:01:54.860 --> 02:01:59.900]
I saw Dr. Sanjay goop over there and bet it was a principle of the war

[02:01:59.900 --> 02:02:05.320]
He and the others of you in the mainstream media refused to ask our leaders the hard questions

[02:02:05.320 --> 02:02:09.640]
And demand the honest answers and that's why we're in this war we're in the fifth year of this war

[02:02:09.640 --> 02:02:14.200]
Because you and CNN Dr. Gupta you didn't do your jobs back then

[02:02:14.200 --> 02:02:18.220]
And now here we are in this mess what if you'd actually done the job on that

[02:02:18.220 --> 02:02:23.320]
That's why anybody who hears anything of what you say now about universal health care

[02:02:23.320 --> 02:02:27.880]
Should question what you're saying what you're putting out there you didn't do the job for us with a war

[02:02:27.880 --> 02:02:33.220]
You're not doing it with this issue and I just I just wondering when the American people are going to turn off their TV sets

[02:02:33.220 --> 02:02:34.880]
And put listening to this stuff right?

[02:02:35.260 --> 02:02:39.780]
Right right now would be good. I mean like you go Mike how you like that?

[02:02:40.320 --> 02:02:42.380]
I like it a lot. And there's a little blitzkrieg would it be?

[02:02:42.420 --> 02:02:44.140]
Yeah yeah yeah yeah. I mean lining them though, yeah.

[02:02:44.860 --> 02:02:49.060]
Michael Moore posted a lengthy critique of a CNN reality check that attacked his newest film, Sico

[02:02:49.060 --> 02:02:51.560]
Which examines flaws in the West Healthcare industry

[02:02:52.180 --> 02:02:56.500]
In a heated exchange with situation room post the anxious wolf blitzkrieg

[02:02:56.500 --> 02:02:59.400]
The second part of which is said to air tonight at 7 o'clock by the way

[02:02:59.400 --> 02:03:03.160]
Moore said the four minute report which aired immediately before his appearance was biased

[02:03:03.780 --> 02:03:09.300]
On his website, Moore said the Sico truth squad refuted many of the findings in Dr. Sanger Gupta's reporting

[02:03:09.300 --> 02:03:13.780]
Which concluded that Moore did fudge facts some facts in the movie he fudged it

[02:03:14.560 --> 02:03:18.400]
This is libel the website says there is not a single fact that's fudged in the film

[02:03:18.400 --> 02:03:21.880]
We expect CNN to correct their mistakes on the air and apologize to the reviewers

[02:03:22.800 --> 02:03:26.820]
Moore's website also posts links to discussions of his appearance on prominent liberal blogs

[02:03:26.820 --> 02:03:29.880]
Including Crookson Liars, Huffington Post and Brad Blog

[02:03:31.480 --> 02:03:35.780]
Rachel Sklar writing and Huffington Post said the clip is spreading around the net like wildfire

[02:03:35.780 --> 02:03:41.040]
And Brad Blogs Brad Feedman applauded Moore's dead on target ass whooping to hapless wolf blitzkrieg and friends

[02:03:41.760 --> 02:03:43.680]
How'd you like that? He was just ripping him an ass?

[02:03:43.700 --> 02:03:45.080]
Yes, ripping him a bigger one

[02:03:45.080 --> 02:03:49.240]
Long overdue baby, they need to be taken off the air now

[02:03:49.240 --> 02:03:52.200]
I want to do this because the journalists and the doctors are going to be better

[02:03:52.200 --> 02:03:56.040]
But I'm going to be better by Dr. Sanger Gupta he's busy banging all the chicks there at CNN

[02:03:57.700 --> 02:04:03.740]
Gupta backs up more is finding that the US healthcare system is number 37 on the WHOS rankings of healthcare systems around the world

[02:04:03.740 --> 02:04:08.460]
But Gupta encourages viewers to hold on before believing Cuba's healthcare system is better

[02:04:08.460 --> 02:04:12.960]
After Moore takes people out of receive treatment because Cuba ranks lower than the US coming at number 39

[02:04:13.820 --> 02:04:18.960]
Sikko shows the who list including Cuba's placement below the US some more says he's not trying to deceive anybody

[02:04:19.580 --> 02:04:26.020]
The fact that the healthcare system in an impoverished nation crippled by our decades old blockade including medical supplies and drugs

[02:04:26.020 --> 02:04:31.140]
Ranked so closely to ours is more an indictment of the American system than the Cuban system more as website says

[02:04:31.800 --> 02:04:40.060]
In his piece Dr. Prupta says Moore is wrong in asserting the US spends $7,000 per person on healthcare compared to Cuba spending $25 per person

[02:04:40.060 --> 02:04:45.140]
Putting the figure for the US at $6,096 per person and Cuba spending at $229.

[02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:56.260]
More links to a study from the Department of Health and Human Services that projected health spending for 2006 at $7,092 per capita and $7,498 for 2007

[02:04:57.360 --> 02:05:03.260]
As for Cuba Moore's site says Dr. Prupta and CNN need to watch Sikko first before commenting on it

[02:05:03.260 --> 02:05:08.800]
Sikko says Cuba spends $251 per person on healthcare not 25 bucks is pooped the reports

[02:05:08.800 --> 02:05:15.480]
And the BBC reports that Cuba's per capita health for expenditure is $251 just like it says in the freaking movie

[02:05:15.480 --> 02:05:19.620]
And Prupta is wrong in asserting Americans that have just slightly longer than Cuban's Moore says

[02:05:19.620 --> 02:05:25.720]
Just the opposite the website says the 2006 United Nations Human Development Reports Human Development Index states

[02:05:25.720 --> 02:05:30.760]
The life expectancy in the US is 77.5 years in Cuba 77.6 years

[02:05:31.900 --> 02:05:38.960]
The CNN report also states the fact that Americans have shorter wait times than everybody but Germans for non-emergency treatment like HIPAA placements or NEA repairs

[02:05:38.960 --> 02:05:44.940]
Moore says this isn't the whole truth and that for Sikko is waiting for a doctor's appointment only Canadians have longer wait times, eh?

[02:05:46.460 --> 02:05:50.680]
In New Zealand 81% of patients get the same one next day appointment for a non-routine visit

[02:05:50.680 --> 02:05:56.660]
The comparable figures were 71% in Britain 47% of the US and 36% in Canada

[02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:05.080]
Moore also refutes CNN's airing over healthcare aim list explaining that citizens in other countries pay higher taxes to fund the more expansive healthcare programs

[02:06:05.080 --> 02:06:11.080]
The movie never claims that healthcare has provided absolutely free in other countries without tax contributions from citizens more points out

[02:06:11.080 --> 02:06:15.660]
Along with the fact that half of all the bankruptcy in the US are triggered by medical bills according to MSNBC

[02:06:17.020 --> 02:06:22.340]
The truth squad did not mention the conclusion Gupta reached in this report that there's one fact everyone agrees on

[02:06:22.340 --> 02:06:25.240]
The system here should be far better

[02:06:25.700 --> 02:06:26.800]
How do you like that?

[02:06:27.080 --> 02:06:28.420]
Dr. Puptus is that

[02:06:29.460 --> 02:06:36.700]
It sucks it blows not as much as Joyce though and you know we haven't played in a long long time even a little bit on this show

[02:06:36.700 --> 02:06:39.240]
We have no far sounds anymore

[02:06:40.320 --> 02:06:42.380]
Haven't played even just a little tiny bit of that

[02:06:43.180 --> 02:06:45.680]
And you know keep in mind that somebody lied to us about that

[02:06:45.680 --> 02:06:49.280]
Well corporate doesn't want you to play that no mo you know no mo

[02:06:49.280 --> 02:06:51.220]
Don't don't do it all other crap

[02:06:52.300 --> 02:06:57.480]
And little Tom jica sits over there and his little ivory tower right and about well you know maybe a fun and entertain

[02:06:57.480 --> 02:07:01.060]
It wouldn't be so bad going back to that you know ho ho like that you know

[02:07:02.440 --> 02:07:09.820]
I think very fun and entertain would be like to yank out his last remaining here is follicle by follicle starting with his belly like that

[02:07:10.480 --> 02:07:13.020]
All right speaking of Pentejo

[02:07:14.440 --> 02:07:18.180]
Well it is a pretty old pubic here yeah right we'd like a tweezer

[02:07:44.960 --> 02:07:49.660]
All right look who that is everybody look who that is

[02:07:50.200 --> 02:07:54.260]

He's a racing winner race around the car that is the race driver that never wins that is the winner he wins

[02:08:04.880 --> 02:08:09.300]

2016 votes out our award winning pool how are we doing with the Humper on that that's the real battle there

[02:09:16.100 --> 02:09:18.280]
People want to somebody to hang up through a microphone

[02:09:18.280 --> 02:09:20.280]
Larry King the wind's hands down

[02:09:20.280 --> 02:09:24.760]
Hank's got 69 oh sorry and I got 51 he's got me beat big time

You think I can catch him if you start now

[02:09:28.120 --> 02:09:31.720]
No he's running a lot faster than I am

[02:09:33.280 --> 02:09:37.160]
Maria Guerrero's 911 cost started out calm Sunday morning a soft measured voice

[02:09:37.160 --> 02:09:40.060]
She tells it especially that her ex-boyfriend Mario wouldn't leave her alone

[02:09:40.060 --> 02:09:42.500]
You're not gonna like my take on this story you want to know why

[02:09:43.120 --> 02:09:45.000]
Well let's see what your take is and then I'll let you

[02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:45.660]
Okay

[02:09:46.440 --> 02:09:48.660]
When we went through the recording and I'm loving this fancy

[02:09:48.660 --> 02:09:51.040]
Hip-hop part of the man's wild night wielding attack

[02:09:51.040 --> 02:09:54.300]
That authority say left Guerrero and her roommate would stab wounds

[02:09:54.300 --> 02:09:57.280]
And the ex-boyfriend Mario Cruz dead from a deputies gun

[02:09:59.440 --> 02:10:02.500]
The call came and we'll see I saw the story on the Sun Center website

[02:10:02.500 --> 02:10:06.360]
Whenever the hell what when did this happen Sunday morning so I guess I seen it yesterday

[02:10:07.580 --> 02:10:12.080]
Right and Mario even though he's dead and even though he was obviously out of control and the wild man

[02:10:12.080 --> 02:10:15.840]
He was a good looking guy I said and you know me I always started with the good one

[02:10:15.840 --> 02:10:20.840]
I do know that well that's right calls he must have some reason the call came

[02:10:21.560 --> 02:10:23.080]
Oh that is so bad

[02:10:23.080 --> 02:10:29.000]
The call came in just after 6am from a home in the 7100 block of Southgate Boulevard in Tamarack

[02:10:29.560 --> 02:10:32.860]
Guerrero complained that Cruz had been knocking on the windows all morning and wouldn't leave

[02:10:33.280 --> 02:10:36.640]
He's not welcome to my house and he knows that he was just trying to get it in my house

[02:10:36.640 --> 02:10:39.380]
And he's not letting me or my roommate sleep Guerrero told the dispatcher

[02:10:39.380 --> 02:10:42.720]
He's knocking on my windows have been telling me to leave for the past hour he hasn't been listening

[02:10:43.280 --> 02:10:46.060]
Guerrero calmly added and I'm sure he might be violent

[02:10:46.060 --> 02:10:48.860]
The dispatcher replied he has a history of violence

[02:10:48.860 --> 02:10:53.220]
Yes he does Viral responded as the call goes on the noise in the background intensifies

[02:10:53.220 --> 02:10:57.780]
The dispatcher asks is it Cruz then a huge crash? Oh my God

[02:10:57.780 --> 02:10:59.280]
Oh my God

[02:10:59.280 --> 02:11:01.000]
He just broke my window Viral Yield

[02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:03.180]
The recording then becomes chaotic

[02:11:03.840 --> 02:11:07.060]
Guerrero can be heard yelling at Cruz to leave she screams

[02:11:07.900 --> 02:11:09.460]
Let me say it again she screams

[02:11:10.960 --> 02:11:14.760]
He has a knife he has a knife and he's stabbing me Viral Yields of this dispatcher

[02:11:14.760 --> 02:11:16.420]
Man he just stabbed us

[02:11:16.420 --> 02:11:19.920]
That nice though that she said man that's always the right

[02:11:19.920 --> 02:11:23.120]
When you get in the stab and she said man I can probably lost it

[02:11:23.120 --> 02:11:27.280]
For last words of dispatcher our please for help oh my God

[02:11:27.280 --> 02:11:28.160]
Oh my God

[02:11:28.160 --> 02:11:29.760]
Help help please we need help help

[02:11:29.760 --> 02:11:32.860]
Not long after that a deputy arrived in fatally shot Cruz

[02:11:32.860 --> 02:11:34.060]
How's 27

[02:11:35.820 --> 02:11:38.020]
Viral Yields of this dispatcher

[02:11:38.020 --> 02:11:44.140]
Viral Yields of this dispatcher

[02:11:44.140 --> 02:11:44.740]
Viral Yields of this dispatcher

[02:11:44.740 --> 02:11:44.740]

[02:11:45.240 --> 02:11:46.260]
Viral Yields of this dispatcher

[02:11:46.260 --> 02:11:50.200]
Cruz's death marked the fourth time this year that a brown deputy is fatally shot somebody

[02:11:50.200 --> 02:11:52.560]
I wonder if the first three was good looking as he was

[02:11:53.160 --> 02:11:54.420]
He was a good looking guy

[02:11:54.420 --> 02:11:58.780]
There's that old expression about you know the beautiful on the outside and also on the inside

[02:11:58.780 --> 02:11:59.380]
Uh huh

[02:11:59.380 --> 02:12:00.340]
Well I guess not

[02:12:00.340 --> 02:12:00.860]
Not

[02:12:00.860 --> 02:12:03.120]
He was beautiful on the outside

[02:12:03.120 --> 02:12:06.180]
But nasty on him and maybe I don't know he's dead

[02:12:07.100 --> 02:12:10.540]
The BSO identified that deputy lay the shooting is Gregory Stanley 34

[02:12:10.540 --> 02:12:12.440]
He's been with the agency since 2002

[02:12:12.440 --> 02:12:15.800]
He's been placed on routine paid administrative league to the investigations complete

[02:12:15.800 --> 02:12:19.500]
The shooting rattles Shirley Mennick who moved to Southgate villas for solitude

[02:12:19.500 --> 02:12:21.200]
Oh oh surprise Shirley

[02:12:21.900 --> 02:12:27.120]
It's very unsettling said Mennick 71 is living in the housing complex and the 7100 block of Southgate

[02:12:27.120 --> 02:12:31.400]
Boulevard for only a few months I came here for peace and quiet I haven't gotten any she said

[02:12:33.400 --> 02:12:37.140]
According to the Sheriff's Office a raging cruise armed with two large knives

[02:12:37.140 --> 02:12:39.880]
I was heard a barbecue grill through the bedroom window of Burrow's townhouse

[02:12:40.400 --> 02:12:43.840]
Burrow and Nick far flood the apartment only to be chased down and stabbed by crews

[02:12:43.840 --> 02:12:46.540]
A deputy shot crews when he refused to drop the knives

[02:12:47.540 --> 02:12:47.940]
Good

[02:12:49.060 --> 02:12:50.600]
Why is that good? Drop the knife

[02:12:51.140 --> 02:12:51.660]
That's right

[02:12:52.100 --> 02:12:52.960]
Well what kind of that?

[02:12:53.040 --> 02:12:54.980]
That's like bows and arrows against guns man

[02:12:54.980 --> 02:12:56.000]
I just don't get it

[02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:56.360]
Yeah I guess who wins

[02:12:57.840 --> 02:12:59.700]
Well I've sound to me like here

[02:12:59.700 --> 02:13:02.880]
From the front of the wall that shows you did with D-Full all those years

[02:13:02.880 --> 02:13:04.080]
Do you ever end to work his show?

[02:13:04.440 --> 02:13:04.620]
Yes

[02:13:05.140 --> 02:13:05.780]
I'm so sorry

[02:13:06.460 --> 02:13:06.860]
Whatever

[02:13:07.640 --> 02:13:12.260]
Investigators have a release they loaded for the attack but Burrow repeatedly tells crews the night of a recording that he was not

[02:13:12.260 --> 02:13:13.740]
Inemily involved with anyone else

[02:13:15.040 --> 02:13:18.220]
Burrow who was released Sunday from University Hospital can be reached for comment

[02:13:18.780 --> 02:13:22.740]
Her next door neighbor Miguel Diaz 28 said Burrow and crews had moved to South Florida from Jersey

[02:13:22.740 --> 02:13:25.200]
They pair lived together for a while and moved to part

[02:13:26.740 --> 02:13:30.100]
Crews' parents can be reached for comment he does not have a criminal record in Florida

[02:13:30.100 --> 02:13:31.920]
And he won't have one because he's dead

[02:13:32.840 --> 02:13:38.200]
Men in whose front to outside walls and patio were still smeared with dried blood yesterday

[02:13:38.200 --> 02:13:42.820]
Said she awoke Sunday to screams and pounding on her front door shortly before 6 a.m

[02:13:42.820 --> 02:13:45.140]
I just heard those loud thumps

[02:13:45.140 --> 02:13:51.460]
Then I heard this girl screaming she was really terrified said men who were called being too braggied asleep to immediately realize what was happening

[02:13:51.460 --> 02:13:52.780]
With too braggied with sleep

[02:13:52.780 --> 02:13:57.300]
Men in Slater Burrow's roommate is T-shirt soaked in blood collapsed on men in his patio

[02:13:57.300 --> 02:14:01.020]
She went there for peace and quiet and she got serious

[02:14:02.020 --> 02:14:06.040]
Now why are you doing with an accident like that? I mean does that sound Jewish to you? Mending? I don't know

[02:14:06.520 --> 02:14:06.920]
Hmm

[02:14:07.580 --> 02:14:10.100]
Do you have to be Jewish to talk like that? I think you do

[02:14:10.100 --> 02:14:15.500]
A rapid swing of gunshots from a deputy fall with crews collapsing dead in the complexes parking lot

[02:14:15.500 --> 02:14:18.900]
Why do they have to kill him for quite a while? He had knives that had a gun

[02:14:18.900 --> 02:14:21.700]
Why do you have to kill him?

[02:14:23.840 --> 02:14:24.640]
Because why?

[02:14:24.960 --> 02:14:26.380]
Knives are deadly weapons

[02:14:26.380 --> 02:14:27.040]
Yeah

[02:14:27.520 --> 02:14:28.220]
And with a close...

[02:14:28.220 --> 02:14:31.280]
Actually another deadly weapon too but doesn't mention that one in the story

[02:14:31.280 --> 02:14:33.020]
Well you could go check it out I'm sure he's on ice

[02:14:33.020 --> 02:14:34.520]
Oh he's not that he's dead

[02:14:34.520 --> 02:14:36.000]
I can go have a cold one

[02:14:37.420 --> 02:14:38.340]
Oh no

[02:14:39.340 --> 02:14:41.840]
Diaz said Nickfarrer had recently moved into the villa with Barerro

[02:14:41.840 --> 02:14:45.540]
He said he saw Nickfarr moving belongings into the unit on Saturday

[02:14:45.540 --> 02:14:47.440]
He described Barerro as quite a nice

[02:14:48.040 --> 02:14:50.680]
A Monday her broken bedrubindo was boarded up with plywood

[02:14:50.680 --> 02:14:54.380]
A damaged white Venetian blind hung above the broken glass in long loops

[02:14:55.740 --> 02:15:00.440]
Barerro also punged on neighbor Jennifer Guzman's door leaving bloody streaks all over the white paint Guzman

[02:15:00.440 --> 02:15:03.600]
Said Barerro was wearing a blue bathroom and her hand was bleeding Guzman

[02:15:03.600 --> 02:15:07.780]
Said she was panicking saying please help me my ex-boyfriend is trying to stab her

[02:15:07.780 --> 02:15:09.600]
I said Guzman 35

[02:15:09.600 --> 02:15:12.480]
My ex-bottages gravy and a punky pie

[02:15:13.200 --> 02:15:16.520]
How do you like that? Well that's a horrible story there and he got all whipped up

[02:15:16.520 --> 02:15:20.180]
You know sounds like kind of an OJ thing good thing nobody got killed except him

[02:15:20.180 --> 02:15:20.460]
Yeah

[02:15:21.120 --> 02:15:23.980]
Well he was a good looking guy at least in the picture they put in the paper

[02:15:23.980 --> 02:15:25.500]
Maybe they're just trying to make him look good you know

[02:15:26.940 --> 02:15:29.380]
I've always told him that and it's true in society

[02:15:29.380 --> 02:15:33.640]
And I'm not just talking about an old bag like me that's like a sucker for a pretty face a guy's face

[02:15:33.640 --> 02:15:37.880]
And it's just in society we tend to sympathize with good looking people

[02:15:37.880 --> 02:15:40.620]
Nasty looking people it's like oh you know and that's right

[02:15:40.620 --> 02:15:43.960]
Weird looking people like John Mark Car for example that's what he's like

[02:15:43.960 --> 02:15:46.880]
Who's back in the music and two but I'm not going to talk about he isn't nut

[02:15:47.680 --> 02:15:48.420]
He's back in the news?

[02:15:49.280 --> 02:15:54.240]
Yeah, oh they arrested they busted him for something it's on our website somewhere with a good point of response

[02:15:54.240 --> 02:15:57.960]
I wouldn't read anymore about him that I would about Paris Freaking Hilton for Christ's sake

[02:15:59.540 --> 02:16:00.420]
Was it Kitty Point?

[02:16:02.060 --> 02:16:05.660]
Leasing that was not it had nothing to do with nothing like that I don't remember what it was

[02:16:05.660 --> 02:16:08.160]
Well why are you pushing me on John Mark Car?

[02:16:08.220 --> 02:16:10.360]
Just to be a one of them breaking back again? Just to be a bastard

[02:16:10.360 --> 02:16:12.720]
Now he definitely looks like the ship had landed didn't he?

[02:16:12.720 --> 02:16:12.980]
Oh yeah

[02:16:12.980 --> 02:16:14.360]
Oh yeah

[02:16:15.940 --> 02:16:23.440]
One day Starbucks when I'm traveling Manhattan and lies a feather stone and the nation says she had the privilege of attending several hours of the proceedings

[02:16:23.440 --> 02:16:29.960]
On the way down Tantan she says I noticed that a young woman on the subway seemed to be using a brown paper Starbucks bag as a purse

[02:16:29.960 --> 02:16:31.800]
And it did make a pretty nice handbag

[02:16:32.740 --> 02:16:37.300]
Starbucks professions of concern for corporate responsibility are much like that attractive packaging

[02:16:37.820 --> 02:16:42.360]
And the trial that began yesterday the nation's leading purveyor of coffee flavored milk drinks

[02:16:43.260 --> 02:16:49.760]
Stands accused by the National Liberation's Board of 30 violations of employee rights especially firing workers for union organizing

[02:16:50.380 --> 02:16:58.000]
Starbucks had seven lawyers present the two fired workers in question Daniel Gross and Joe Agan's junior both IWDW members were present

[02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:03.340]
Gross wore a suit and looked sharp as any activist appearing before a judge probably showed Agan's went for a less formal look

[02:17:03.340 --> 02:17:04.780]
A sleeveless muscle t-shirt

[02:17:05.380 --> 02:17:07.720]
Oh that's right go to court and a sleeveless muscle t-shirt

[02:17:08.380 --> 02:17:10.040]
Maybe the judge is a mighty colon

[02:17:10.600 --> 02:17:16.360]
Today both sides waited through details of discovery meaning yesterday that is to say the NLRB lawyers asked for documents from Starbucks

[02:17:16.360 --> 02:17:22.500]
And the company's legal team wind about how burdensome would be to get so many documents because since the turnover rate is so high

[02:17:22.500 --> 02:17:24.960]
Many of the relevant personnel files are now in storage

[02:17:25.460 --> 02:17:31.940]
It's very difficult to get the files out once they go in and stays the Eisenstein when a Starbucks leaked outside counsel argued with a straight face

[02:17:31.940 --> 02:17:39.260]
More incredibly before the hearing had officially begun she disputed the NLRB's contention that there was a union campaign going on when Gross and Agan were fired

[02:17:39.260 --> 02:17:47.700]
If that's a major cornerstone of Starbucks defense the company could be in trouble because the judge who seemed very fair minded and interested in reaching reasonable compromises didn't buy it

[02:17:47.700 --> 02:17:54.200]
And a lot of discovery based on the assumption that the date of the union campaign was relevant also this ample public record of the campaign including media coverage

[02:17:54.200 --> 02:17:58.200]
It'll be interesting to see what happens I can't be there for much of the rest of the trial unfortunately

[02:17:58.200 --> 02:18:05.240]
So I hope other journalists and bloggers will go check it out they're taking today off and back in session money on it says lies a further stone in the nation

[02:18:05.860 --> 02:18:12.400]
Well you might think I mean I know how much you hate the Walmart right you might stop frequently Starbucks so much not too

[02:18:12.900 --> 02:18:21.520]
Maybe a little bit see see that how he picks and chooses who we don't like he likes that coffee latte crap at the Starbucks

[02:18:21.520 --> 02:18:28.240]
I like a a venti moca latte fraccatino please do you really yes I did look for it with whipped cream

[02:18:28.940 --> 02:18:33.400]
I haven't had one a long time because it's not good but I can't see that can influence me normal

[02:18:33.400 --> 02:18:42.920]
I'm not a crap hey I'm on an all-time low man I'm doing great are you really yeah all-time low for like in the past 10 years at least

[02:18:42.920 --> 02:18:47.000]

[02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:49.480]

right the race of independence upper Arlington police conducting computer surveillance

[02:24:58.420 --> 02:25:03.520]
made 24th lengther kidney porn website to Northland and home of John W. Adams who faces two

[02:25:03.520 --> 02:25:09.300]
felony counts of pandering police later search that him someone found two child pornography movies

[02:25:09.300 --> 02:25:14.060]
on his computer according to an upper Arlington police officer has not to be named because he works under covers

[02:25:15.300 --> 02:25:21.220]
Adam 65 has been passed to the Mount Calvary free will back to church in Darbydale for more than 10 years

[02:25:21.220 --> 02:25:25.820]
he was in the Franklin County jail last night and will appear this morning in Franklin County Municipal Court

[02:25:25.820 --> 02:25:32.500]
I guess he already done there here come to judge the two felony charges for pandering sexually oriented

[02:25:32.500 --> 02:25:36.900]
matter involving a child and for downloading possessing kidney porn authorities said church leaders

[02:25:36.900 --> 02:25:41.940]
will claim to me today if the church to discuss the situation I think the world of the person

[02:25:41.940 --> 02:25:46.440]
Neil Warren stepped to a new radicator church said of Adams he's like a brother he is a brother

[02:25:47.060 --> 02:25:52.280]
I think he's a mother we know another fact that he said the church is blessed that Adams had his pastor

[02:25:52.280 --> 02:25:56.940]
coined Adams biography on the church website his biggest dream is to have each and every member of church

[02:25:56.940 --> 02:26:01.540]
walk with him to the gates of heaven probably with little kids who would be there for his amusement and amusement

[02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:07.420]
not another child molesting well we don't know him less than anybody but it sounds like he might like to you know

[02:26:07.420 --> 02:26:10.040]
right he said it don't cost nothing to look

[02:26:11.160 --> 02:26:14.880]
speaking of costing something John McCain he couldn't raise money in a whore house

[02:26:15.920 --> 02:26:20.780]
John McCain's campaign manager and chief strategist resided in a major stash

[02:26:20.780 --> 02:26:27.060]
shakeup for the struggling Republican presidential candidate who's all but broke and is the way lagging in the polls baby

[02:26:27.060 --> 02:26:34.900]
bomb bomb bomb bomb around once the American public found out that McCain was insane they said I don't think I'm giving him no more money

[02:26:34.900 --> 02:26:36.460]
or giving him my vote

[02:26:37.820 --> 02:26:44.000]
in statements Tireen Olson the veteran of Bush's successful 2004 reelection stole an effort said he resigned his campaign manager

[02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:49.840]
effective immediately and John weaver said he stepped down from his post of chief strategist

[02:26:49.840 --> 02:26:54.160]
but other officials have spoken condition about an enmity to avoid discussing private conversations

[02:26:54.160 --> 02:26:57.880]
and Nelson was fired several people close to Nelson disputed that characterization

[02:26:59.260 --> 02:27:04.840]
other officials said Mark Salder was senior aid whom some consider McCain's alter ego will continue to devise him in a voluntary world

[02:27:04.840 --> 02:27:08.380]
but will cease his day to day involvement in the campaign campaign my ass

[02:27:09.380 --> 02:27:14.560]
I think he's finished over that seven o'clock to that I see it in the second part of the Michael Morthin Rippen Wolf

[02:27:14.560 --> 02:27:16.500]
let's quicken a well deserved ass

[02:27:17.460 --> 02:27:22.340]
send Wolf back to the Cabood so okay get him out of our face get him out of the situation room

[02:27:23.100 --> 02:27:23.500]
jackass

[02:27:26.080 --> 02:27:29.640]
to official said Rick Davis a long time a the McCain will take over the campaign

[02:27:29.640 --> 02:27:33.760]
it's been a tremendous honor to serve senator McCain work on his campaign Nelson said

[02:27:34.480 --> 02:27:38.780]
but it be put a boop it about as word of the changes became public McCain was on the center floor

[02:27:38.780 --> 02:27:43.140]
defending the troop build up in a raccoon containing the reinforcements that only just been put in place

[02:27:43.140 --> 02:27:48.120]
he made his sixth trip to Iraq last week proving beyond the shadow without his statements today that he is

[02:27:48.120 --> 02:27:54.780]
but crazy is a bad bug he never met a war he didn't like make no mistake he said violence in bag that remains an unacceptable

[02:27:54.780 --> 02:28:00.940]
high levels but the US and Iraq seem to be moving in the right direction McCain said the progress

[02:28:00.940 --> 02:28:09.060]
on military has made should encourage us right and I think that the troops and these civilians who are dying now are dying more lightly than perhaps they may have been in the past

[02:28:09.060 --> 02:28:16.060]
but he's a crazy guy maybe he knows what's the thing that the sma fil sma

[02:28:16.060 --> 02:28:23.000]
and that guy on the beach did you see that picture yet or not no no maybe all maybe I'll email it to you

[02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:26.260]
or maybe I won't I don't know

[02:28:28.580 --> 02:28:34.080]
it's too much like work you know it's a little bit of a plus I got to work two full days this week but it's a poor sma

[02:28:36.860 --> 02:28:44.120]
stupid as all story why don't they just eliminate the all-star games the carcress who now cares about it's like at the end of the day

[02:28:44.120 --> 02:28:51.620]
nobody cares about the stupid as all-star game is no hitting the scores like 14 to 10 stuff like that who that wants to see a bunch of crap like that

[02:28:53.200 --> 02:29:00.600]
nobody money is that what it's about of course nobody you know about that

[02:29:01.120 --> 02:29:05.080]
I like that I have some I know that Chris would like to have some money anybody out there want to help them out

[02:29:05.080 --> 02:29:12.020]
anybody want to make a donation to the Chris Raven survival fund no we think I understand the speed corner out there

[02:29:12.020 --> 02:29:19.020]
where Miguel used to stand look what it did for him that's okay we sure miss our good friend Miguel you got screwed over by

[02:29:19.020 --> 02:29:28.120]
good bye they killed you did your job real well by Jolly Raleigh Jodair brought another one of those flunkies from Raleigh in I think the whole city of Raleigh is going to be working

[02:29:28.120 --> 02:29:33.940]
in the QM pretty soon I don't know what the unemployment rate in Raleigh is but it's going to be dropping real fast very soon

[02:29:34.560 --> 02:29:40.400]
because all those shlippers up there that couldn't get hired in a panty rate they're going to be working a QAM nobody on that payroll

[02:29:41.320 --> 02:29:42.820]
no wonder we can't make any money

[02:29:42.820 --> 02:29:43.940]
I'm not a badger guy

[02:29:47.920 --> 02:29:49.560]
I'm dying on the air

[02:29:50.560 --> 02:29:51.560]
yeah

[02:30:05.120 --> 02:30:05.600]
here

[02:30:19.640 --> 02:30:24.160]
Rollin' runin' Rollin' rollin' in the morning

[02:30:25.520 --> 02:30:28.720]
The big old hairy, caring glasses

[02:30:29.740 --> 02:30:33.460]
On his boy, he's got a life in most cars

[02:30:33.460 --> 02:30:37.440]
Childhood was tragic So it took a magic

[02:30:37.440 --> 02:30:41.160]
He can fly up through what he can't have a car

[02:30:41.160 --> 02:30:44.300]
This could not be harder

[02:30:45.220 --> 02:30:48.080]
Here comes Mary and Father

[02:30:48.080 --> 02:30:49.000]
Oh my God

[02:30:51.340 --> 02:30:55.160]
Rollin' rollin' Rollin' rollin' in the morning

[02:30:56.080 --> 02:30:56.960]
131 and 56

[02:30:56.960 --> 02:30:58.100]
You better get with it, George

[02:30:58.100 --> 02:30:59.700]
You better go and see the new hairy Potter flick

[02:30:59.700 --> 02:31:01.960]
Or else you're gonna be gone and what?

[02:31:02.500 --> 02:31:03.960]
Listen out, I'll pass

[02:31:03.960 --> 02:31:06.360]
And here's the fact that says Uncle Eli

[02:31:06.360 --> 02:31:08.480]
agree with George that some great songs do get played today

[02:31:08.480 --> 02:31:12.120]
But every breath you take is one of those rare songs

[02:31:12.120 --> 02:31:13.400]
that I never tire of hearing

[02:31:13.400 --> 02:31:14.940]
And I would say amen to that

[02:31:15.920 --> 02:31:17.460]
How could you not love that song?

[02:31:17.460 --> 02:31:20.460]
I did once upon a time and maybe I listened to movie radio

[02:31:20.460 --> 02:31:21.940]
then you, yeah

[02:31:21.940 --> 02:31:23.960]
I got to play the death

[02:31:24.720 --> 02:31:26.940]
And so you played it the death of the radio station

[02:31:26.940 --> 02:31:28.060]
You played it the death of an hour and a half

[02:31:28.060 --> 02:31:28.800]
And I heard it the other day

[02:31:31.380 --> 02:31:33.920]
We have heard it in the pack of moonsies

[02:31:34.460 --> 02:31:36.840]
So I was in 52 votes on our poll by the way

[02:31:37.940 --> 02:31:39.240]
Oh you, you are

[02:31:40.160 --> 02:31:42.700]
You are evil man, you are really evil

[02:31:44.780 --> 02:31:45.180]
LAUGHTER

[02:31:47.820 --> 02:31:49.960]
Wow, I'm so good at it even scares me

[02:31:50.800 --> 02:31:53.240]
Victoria Colerber who writes in the San Francisco Chronicle

[02:31:53.240 --> 02:31:56.900]
says, just do this because maybe some people will go out there and watch

[02:31:56.900 --> 02:31:58.260]
Tickle instead of a hair hora

[02:31:58.260 --> 02:31:59.840]
I think they could watch both

[02:31:59.840 --> 02:32:06.820]
and I might watch Tickle because it's an outstanding movie

[02:32:06.820 --> 02:32:07.460]
Need to be seen

[02:32:07.460 --> 02:32:09.460]
The first half it's a little slow

[02:32:09.460 --> 02:32:10.420]
and it's drags

[02:32:10.420 --> 02:32:10.840]
There's something more important.

[02:32:10.840 --> 02:32:13.220]
Why would you want to have a good healthcare system anyway?

[02:32:13.360 --> 02:32:15.420]
Just give the people the money and die.

[02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:16.180]
Right.

[02:32:16.740 --> 02:32:19.440]
And just like Paris Hilton going, they're good taking care of him.

[02:32:20.540 --> 02:32:24.160]
Filmmaker Michael Moore might be on us something in his new documentary Sick O says, Victoria,

[02:32:24.440 --> 02:32:28.120]
these days few Americans are buying the claim that the US has the best medical system in the

[02:32:28.120 --> 02:32:28.380]
world.

[02:32:29.800 --> 02:32:33.580]
With poll showing that healthcare is Americans' top domestic concern, politicians are

[02:32:33.580 --> 02:32:37.820]
scrambling to propose reforms, consumers are buying lower cost eye-mind drugs from foreign

[02:32:37.820 --> 02:32:41.800]
sources, and some even become medical tourists to obtain affordable treatment in other countries.

[02:32:42.720 --> 02:32:46.700]
Study sure Americans are not healthier, nor are they living longer than people in industrialized

[02:32:46.700 --> 02:32:49.580]
nations that spend half per capita of what we do on care.

[02:32:50.200 --> 02:32:54.140]
For example, a 2007 Commonwealth fund study that compared the US with five other nations,

[02:32:54.620 --> 02:32:59.180]
Australia, Canada, Germany, New Zealand, and the UK ranked the US health system last.

[02:33:00.140 --> 02:33:03.460]
The study looked at access to healthcare efficiency, equity, and health living among other

[02:33:03.460 --> 02:33:03.720]
measures.

[02:33:04.160 --> 02:33:04.600]
Healthy living.

[02:33:05.480 --> 02:33:10.760]
In a 2000 report by the WHO, the most reasonable from the UN organization, put the US 37th

[02:33:10.760 --> 02:33:14.940]
out of 190 nations in healthcare services right between Costa Rica and Slovenia.

[02:33:15.420 --> 02:33:21.480]
France was rated number one, UK 18, Canada number 30, Cuba, a couple of noxes behind the

[02:33:21.480 --> 02:33:22.260]
US at 39.

[02:33:23.260 --> 02:33:27.900]
In a New York Times CBS poll conducted March Healthcare ranked as the top domestic concern, and

[02:33:27.900 --> 02:33:31.720]
in Sick O, Moore highlights America's disillusionment with their healthcare system compared to

[02:33:31.720 --> 02:33:35.260]
Texas another country including France, Canada, Britain, and even Cuba.

[02:33:36.440 --> 02:33:39.800]
And like we said the other day, the part about Cuba is just enough to make you scream

[02:33:39.800 --> 02:33:40.400]
and cry.

[02:33:41.080 --> 02:33:43.200]
But of course it's all about your lies, you know, right?

[02:33:43.340 --> 02:33:44.680]
Of course it didn't happen, nothing that.

[02:33:44.940 --> 02:33:48.120]
I think Wolf Blitzkrieg ought to be executed on TV at 7.50 tonight.

[02:33:49.360 --> 02:33:53.180]
Many health experts say, more likely glorify, and that they ought to have Dr. Sanjay pooped

[02:33:53.180 --> 02:33:55.400]
the right in his lap too while they're pulling a swish.

[02:33:56.540 --> 02:34:00.240]
Many health experts say, more likely glorifying other systems, especially the one in France,

[02:34:00.240 --> 02:34:03.940]
still they accept his argument that other nations are doing a better job than the US

[02:34:03.940 --> 02:34:06.880]
and providing coverage for all residents and making sure that people have access to

[02:34:06.880 --> 02:34:08.720]
primary care and preventive services.

[02:34:09.140 --> 02:34:13.280]
The US has a private system for all but the poor and elderly, the country's law, in Sick

[02:34:13.280 --> 02:34:15.640]
O, have national systems funded primarily through the government.

[02:34:16.500 --> 02:34:20.840]
We, unlike any other country, have 46 million people who are uninsured and that raises a

[02:34:20.840 --> 02:34:24.300]
whole host of health and financial issues said, can through a professor of health policy

[02:34:24.300 --> 02:34:25.120]
at Emory University.

[02:34:26.640 --> 02:34:30.080]
Those issues are undermining the health of American civil studies of show, while the United

[02:34:30.080 --> 02:34:34.580]
States may have cutting edge medical technologies, many people like access to such advanced care

[02:34:34.580 --> 02:34:36.560]
limiting any positive health impact.

[02:34:37.180 --> 02:34:41.260]
RS is really a sick care system with tremendous technical capabilities to deal with people

[02:34:41.260 --> 02:34:45.200]
with serious illness, though, if said, he argues that it's far more cost effective to prevent

[02:34:45.200 --> 02:34:48.460]
people from getting sick or release cases illnesses early through better monitoring.

[02:34:50.040 --> 02:34:53.420]
Karen Davis, president of the Commonwealth Fund, a nonprofit foundation that supports

[02:34:53.420 --> 02:34:57.500]
healthcare research said, many of the problems associated with poor primary care can be traced

[02:34:57.500 --> 02:35:00.020]
to the fragmented structure of our healthcare system.

[02:35:00.340 --> 02:35:03.640]
US patients have an act of trouble seeing the same doctor and sure notice, seeing multiple

[02:35:03.640 --> 02:35:07.240]
doctors who sometimes fail to communicate with each other and for gold care because they

[02:35:07.240 --> 02:35:08.060]
don't want to spend the money.

[02:35:09.460 --> 02:35:13.760]
We tend to have more medical errors than other countries because of this highly specialized

[02:35:13.760 --> 02:35:14.720]
fragmented system.

[02:35:14.840 --> 02:35:17.820]
She said, more things can go wrong and they do go wrong.

[02:35:18.760 --> 02:35:21.860]
Morris film has been criticized for showing the positive side of health systems in other

[02:35:21.860 --> 02:35:23.860]
countries while glossing over negative aspects.

[02:35:24.340 --> 02:35:28.420]
There's almost only positive attributes about the British differential human system invariably

[02:35:28.420 --> 02:35:29.400]
no system is perfect.

[02:35:30.100 --> 02:35:33.500]
I think this sort of detracts from this credibility on these comparisons, Steve Zuckerman,

[02:35:33.840 --> 02:35:35.760]
health economist with the Urban Institute in Washington.

[02:35:36.680 --> 02:35:40.440]
More ignores the fact that private coverage still exists in most countries with nationalized

[02:35:40.440 --> 02:35:43.820]
healthcare and he hoids showing solutions other than adoption of a government-funded system

[02:35:43.820 --> 02:35:45.100]
often known as single pair.

[02:35:45.720 --> 02:35:49.200]
He's trying to be entertaining, but if the object appears to kick off a serious study

[02:35:49.200 --> 02:35:53.880]
about the British and Cuba system as an alternative to the US system, you need a lot more than

[02:35:53.880 --> 02:35:55.560]
what's presented in Zuckerman said.

[02:35:56.400 --> 02:36:00.280]
In Zucko, more addresses one of the biggest criticism of the Canadian system, long wait

[02:36:00.280 --> 02:36:04.200]
times for care, by asking patients and non-Intario emergency room how long they had to wait.

[02:36:04.460 --> 02:36:06.060]
All responded that they got treated quickly.

[02:36:07.080 --> 02:36:10.600]
But the Commonwealth Fund report found that both the US and Canadian patients were more

[02:36:10.600 --> 02:36:12.380]
likely to wait six days and more for an appointment.

[02:36:12.740 --> 02:36:15.980]
Waiting times for a specialist to elect a surgery were the shortest in the US and Germany.

[02:36:15.980 --> 02:36:20.060]
US patients were less likely than Canadians to have to wait more than four hours in emergency

[02:36:20.060 --> 02:36:20.600]
room.

[02:36:21.240 --> 02:36:25.540]
More also implies that Karen Canada, Britain and France is virtually free, he dismissed his

[02:36:25.540 --> 02:36:28.480]
claims that the French are overtaxed by showing the comfortable life of a French couple

[02:36:28.480 --> 02:36:30.140]
who even have many left over to travel.

[02:36:31.600 --> 02:36:34.020]
But La Vifreau say is an entirely rosé.

[02:36:35.920 --> 02:36:37.060]
It's not all rosé.

[02:36:37.120 --> 02:36:39.900]
The country has the highest unemployment rate of 9% along with high taxes.

[02:36:40.280 --> 02:36:45.200]
In France, taxes are much more than 44% of gross domestic product compared to 46% of

[02:36:45.200 --> 02:36:45.480]
the US.

[02:36:46.080 --> 02:36:49.160]
Still, the US spends a higher percentage of its gross domestic product and the health

[02:36:49.160 --> 02:36:54.160]
than any other country, more than 16% compared to France's 10.7%.

[02:36:54.160 --> 02:36:58.440]
The US spends over six grand per person in public and private funds compared to 3,100

[02:36:58.440 --> 02:36:59.780]
bucks per capita spending in France.

[02:37:00.180 --> 02:37:02.620]
Americans living in France generally praise the French system.

[02:37:04.660 --> 02:37:08.420]
Roderick Beck, former New Yorker, moved to Paris this spring, said the profit motive that

[02:37:08.420 --> 02:37:12.420]
drives insurance companies as well as physicians is the central problem with the US health system.

[02:37:13.260 --> 02:37:16.540]
One of those insurance companies doing at the most fundamental level, collecting cash

[02:37:16.540 --> 02:37:20.160]
and paying off benefits at Beck 45, or so, for its health communications firm, governments

[02:37:20.160 --> 02:37:24.520]
using taxation and simple healthcare card that do more efficiently do that more efficiently

[02:37:24.520 --> 02:37:25.700]
than insurance-based system.

[02:37:26.380 --> 02:37:30.940]
Bruce Gain, 41 US journalist living in France since 2003, said the French system is better

[02:37:30.940 --> 02:37:34.360]
because the government strictly controls prices and the number of doctors per capita is

[02:37:34.360 --> 02:37:35.560]
much higher than in the US.

[02:37:36.360 --> 02:37:39.780]
And as far as medical technology goes, there are more doctors here to offer the latest

[02:37:39.780 --> 02:37:42.120]
treatments and drugs that affordable cost gain said.

[02:37:42.660 --> 02:37:45.940]
Davis to the Commonwealth fund said the US doesn't need to adopt nationalized healthcare

[02:37:45.940 --> 02:37:46.780]
to improve efficiency.

[02:37:47.260 --> 02:37:50.440]
For example, she said the Netherlands has a well developed system for after hours primary

[02:37:50.440 --> 02:37:52.660]
care that would reduce emergency room visits.

[02:37:53.100 --> 02:37:55.000]
There's a lot we can learn from other countries she said.

[02:37:56.240 --> 02:38:01.820]
The WHO in 2009, the US 37th out of those 191 countries in healthcare, US life expectancy

[02:38:01.820 --> 02:38:05.220]
is nearly three years shorter than average than Canadians and about two years less than

[02:38:05.220 --> 02:38:05.600]
the French.

[02:38:06.800 --> 02:38:11.940]
And the US spent about double in 2004 what France Germany Canada per capita in 2004.

[02:38:12.560 --> 02:38:13.780]
All of these things.

[02:38:14.120 --> 02:38:16.960]
But Dr. Poopdoth, thank you for some good propaganda there on CNN.

[02:38:18.180 --> 02:38:20.240]
Knocked their satellites out of the sky, baby.

[02:38:20.380 --> 02:38:23.820]
Knocked down the tower because there's something in the air.

[02:38:24.380 --> 02:38:25.040]
You're sure as tower.

[02:38:25.240 --> 02:38:26.080]
And you still don't have that.

[02:38:26.200 --> 02:38:27.600]
Oh yeah, you did play that dude, didn't you?

[02:38:27.820 --> 02:38:28.480]
Under Fabinuma.

[02:38:30.260 --> 02:38:32.000]
I wonder if he's came to Alfred E, you think?

[02:38:33.440 --> 02:38:33.860]
They're kidding.

[02:38:33.860 --> 02:38:34.380]
You're president?

[02:38:36.740 --> 02:38:38.140]
1060 votes and Chris is poor.

[02:38:38.360 --> 02:38:40.720]
He's pretty pumped up about that even though he's not saying too much.

[02:38:40.780 --> 02:38:41.520]
Oh, I love it.

[02:38:41.600 --> 02:38:41.940]
It's awesome.

[02:38:42.200 --> 02:38:42.900]
Thank you everybody.

[02:38:43.300 --> 02:38:44.500]
Yeah, thank you everybody.

[02:38:44.620 --> 02:38:45.400]
It's a great day.

[02:38:45.400 --> 02:38:46.000]
Pretty tilt too.

[02:38:47.900 --> 02:38:48.620]
Third man.

[02:38:48.780 --> 02:38:50.740]
From Jolly Fadass Joe, about 30 million times.

[02:38:51.020 --> 02:38:51.960]
I don't know what to tell you.

[02:38:53.700 --> 02:38:55.320]
He's a funny guy that Jolly Joe.

[02:38:55.620 --> 02:38:58.560]
And let's start my paycheck probably showed up again either yesterday or today.

[02:38:59.160 --> 02:38:59.580]
Down there.

[02:38:59.800 --> 02:39:00.000]
All right.

[02:39:00.500 --> 02:39:00.900]
I got these.

[02:39:00.900 --> 02:39:01.040]
Yeah.

[02:39:01.300 --> 02:39:03.620]
Dave Josh Court is if you're listening, I got your check.

[02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:04.740]
Well, you did get it.

[02:39:04.880 --> 02:39:05.000]
Yeah.

[02:39:05.400 --> 02:39:05.880]
How do you like?

[02:39:06.220 --> 02:39:07.080]
Let me tell you right now.

[02:39:07.180 --> 02:39:08.080]
I'm a witch, okay?

[02:39:08.640 --> 02:39:09.680]
Which one are you?

[02:39:10.080 --> 02:39:10.540]
I'm a witch.

[02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:11.780]
Witch of Eastwood.

[02:39:12.140 --> 02:39:12.940]
I really am.

[02:39:14.060 --> 02:39:18.440]
If I could tell you how many times I've picked up that Blackberry and started to send it a text

[02:39:18.440 --> 02:39:21.540]
message to somebody who was at the same instant messaging me.

[02:39:22.740 --> 02:39:23.580]
Happens all the time.

[02:39:24.340 --> 02:39:24.880]
To you too?

[02:39:25.160 --> 02:39:25.260]
Sure.

[02:39:25.880 --> 02:39:27.520]
Oh, then just, then I'm not a witch.

[02:39:27.720 --> 02:39:27.820]
Good.

[02:39:40.200 --> 02:39:40.940]
I'm not a witch.

[02:39:40.940 --> 02:39:40.940]

[02:39:40.940 --> 02:39:40.960]
I'm not a witch.

[02:39:40.960 --> 02:39:40.960]

[02:39:40.960 --> 02:39:40.960]

[02:39:40.960 --> 02:39:40.960]

[02:39:40.960 --> 02:39:40.960]

[02:39:40.960 --> 02:39:40.960]

[02:39:40.960 --> 02:39:40.960]

[02:39:41.440 --> 02:39:41.440]

[02:39:41.440 --> 02:39:41.440]

[02:39:41.440 --> 02:39:41.440]

I'm not a witch.

[02:39:43.340 --> 02:39:43.700]
I'm not a witch.

[02:39:43.700 --> 02:39:44.080]

[02:40:11.820 --> 02:40:11.820]

[02:40:11.820 --> 02:40:11.820]

[02:40:11.820 --> 02:40:11.820]

[02:40:11.820 --> 02:40:11.820]

[02:40:50.600 --> 02:40:50.600]

[02:40:50.600 --> 02:40:50.600]

[02:40:50.660 --> 02:40:50.660]

[02:40:50.660 --> 02:40:50.660]

[02:40:50.680 --> 02:40:50.800]
I'm not a witch.

[02:40:50.800 --> 02:40:50.860]

[02:40:56.860 --> 02:40:58.000]
You're pushing it too hard.

[02:40:58.220 --> 02:40:59.020]
What was that?

[02:40:59.780 --> 02:41:00.620]
One moment please.

[02:41:00.860 --> 02:41:01.540]
I said 68.

[02:41:01.860 --> 02:41:02.980]
I don't have a date for it.

[02:41:03.140 --> 02:41:03.640]
Oh good.

[02:41:03.640 --> 02:41:03.640]

[02:41:03.640 --> 02:41:03.640]

[02:41:04.900 --> 02:41:05.480]
I don't have a date for it.

[02:41:05.480 --> 02:41:06.040]
What the hell is this?

[02:41:06.120 --> 02:41:07.060]
I'm going to make a loud sound.

[02:41:07.720 --> 02:41:08.520]
What does it say here?

[02:41:14.440 --> 02:41:15.200]

[02:42:11.800 --> 02:42:11.800]

[02:42:11.800 --> 02:42:11.800]

[02:42:11.800 --> 02:42:11.860]
What does it say here?

[02:42:11.860 --> 02:42:11.860]

[02:42:11.860 --> 02:42:11.860]

[02:42:11.860 --> 02:42:11.860]

[02:42:11.860 --> 02:42:11.860]

[02:42:11.860 --> 02:42:11.860]

[02:42:11.860 --> 02:42:11.860]

[02:42:11.860 --> 02:42:11.940]
What does it say here?

[02:42:12.100 --> 02:42:12.200]
What does it say here?

What does it say here?

[02:42:13.380 --> 02:42:13.600]
What does it say here?

[02:42:13.600 --> 02:42:14.080]
What does it say here?

[02:42:14.080 --> 02:42:14.720]
What does it say here?

[02:42:54.900 --> 02:42:54.900]

[02:43:15.780 --> 02:43:16.680]
What does it say here?

[02:43:16.840 --> 02:43:16.840]

[02:43:16.840 --> 02:43:16.840]

[02:43:16.840 --> 02:43:16.840]

[02:43:16.840 --> 02:43:16.840]

[02:43:16.840 --> 02:43:16.840]

[02:43:16.840 --> 02:43:16.840]

[02:43:16.840 --> 02:43:16.840]

[02:43:16.840 --> 02:43:16.840]

[02:43:16.860 --> 02:43:16.860]

[02:43:16.860 --> 02:43:16.860]

[02:43:16.860 --> 02:43:16.860]

[02:43:16.860 --> 02:43:16.860]

[02:43:16.860 --> 02:43:16.860]

[02:43:16.860 --> 02:43:16.860]

[02:43:16.860 --> 02:43:16.860]

What does it say here?

[02:43:17.940 --> 02:43:19.120]
What does it say here?

[02:43:19.260 --> 02:43:20.960]
What does it say here?

[02:43:21.120 --> 02:43:23.420]
What does it say here?

[02:43:23.580 --> 02:43:24.260]
What does it say here?

[02:43:24.340 --> 02:43:24.340]

[02:43:24.380 --> 02:43:24.880]
What does it say here?

[02:43:30.300 --> 02:43:35.940]

[02:43:50.960 --> 02:43:50.980]
What does it say here?

[02:43:50.980 --> 02:43:51.000]
What does it say here?

[02:43:51.000 --> 02:43:51.000]

[02:43:51.000 --> 02:43:51.000]

[02:43:51.000 --> 02:43:51.000]

[02:43:51.000 --> 02:43:51.000]

[02:43:51.000 --> 02:43:51.000]

[02:43:51.000 --> 02:43:51.000]

[02:43:51.000 --> 02:43:51.000]

[02:43:51.020 --> 02:43:51.080]
What does it say here?

[02:43:51.080 --> 02:43:51.080]

[02:43:51.080 --> 02:43:51.080]

[02:43:51.080 --> 02:43:51.080]

[02:43:51.080 --> 02:43:51.080]

[02:43:51.080 --> 02:43:51.080]

[02:43:51.080 --> 02:43:51.080]

[02:43:51.080 --> 02:43:51.980]
What does it say here?

[02:43:51.980 --> 02:43:52.220]
What does it say here?

[02:43:52.220 --> 02:43:53.540]
What does it say here?

[02:43:53.560 --> 02:43:54.860]
What does it say here?

[02:43:54.860 --> 02:43:54.860]

[02:43:54.860 --> 02:43:54.860]

[02:43:54.860 --> 02:43:54.860]

[02:43:54.860 --> 02:43:56.740]
What are they talking about?

[02:43:57.240 --> 02:43:58.300]
What are these people doing here?

[02:43:58.420 --> 02:44:01.360]
I'm on the air and I'm getting 85,000 messages here now.

[02:44:02.900 --> 02:44:03.900]
Keeps it interesting, I guess.

[02:44:04.500 --> 02:44:04.740]
Yeah.

[02:44:05.300 --> 02:44:07.240]
I'm on the air and Muff Lindsay is...

[02:44:07.240 --> 02:44:07.900]
But it'd be put a boop.

[02:44:08.080 --> 02:44:09.900]
Whatever you want, I'll go ahead and sell it.

[02:44:10.000 --> 02:44:11.520]
Okay, if you can sell something, we'll take the money.

[02:44:11.640 --> 02:44:12.140]
You know how that works.

[02:44:12.540 --> 02:44:13.060]
No paycheck.

[02:44:14.720 --> 02:44:16.260]
I think I should go on strike right now.

[02:44:16.360 --> 02:44:18.600]
Today is the 10th of July last time I checked.

[02:44:18.880 --> 02:44:20.200]
Where'd it house my paycheck, Joe Bell?

[02:44:21.820 --> 02:44:22.660]
Can you believe that?

[02:44:22.780 --> 02:44:23.380]
As of 1.30?

[02:44:23.700 --> 02:44:24.220]
No paycheck?

[02:44:24.220 --> 02:44:25.600]
Oh, they got a pay-boke of Brian somehow.

[02:44:25.880 --> 02:44:27.080]
They can't pay both of you.

[02:44:30.900 --> 02:44:33.960]
Sooner or later, sooner or later,

[02:44:34.120 --> 02:44:36.160]
eventually this always happens.

[02:44:37.420 --> 02:44:41.040]
They've been nice and early and they're too early for a long time now.

[02:44:41.120 --> 02:44:44.280]
And all of a sudden, I don't know why when you expected the least, no paycheck.

[02:44:53.300 --> 02:44:54.240]
But what is that?

[02:44:55.320 --> 02:44:55.880]
Sooner or later.

[02:44:57.380 --> 02:44:58.680]
What's one here, a different version.

[02:44:59.660 --> 02:45:01.100]
And Donna's got a version, different time.

[02:45:08.380 --> 02:45:09.740]
What do we do about this?

[02:45:10.920 --> 02:45:14.100]
I think you should...

[02:45:15.360 --> 02:45:18.420]
I mean, I'll go over there to accounting if you want me to during this.

[02:45:18.540 --> 02:45:19.700]
I don't want you to go over to accounting.

[02:45:19.860 --> 02:45:22.200]
I want you to go over there and jump up and down on somebody's desk

[02:45:22.200 --> 02:45:27.180]
and scream and yell and holler and drop your pants and drop a huge load right on somebody's desk.

[02:45:27.600 --> 02:45:32.100]
I'll go inquire and then get back to you and let you know what they say.

[02:45:32.620 --> 02:45:35.580]
The way the inquiry is said, where the hell is Neil's paycheck for a crisis?

[02:45:35.840 --> 02:45:36.880]
What is wrong with people?

[02:45:37.160 --> 02:45:38.160]
Are you people crazy?

[02:45:38.540 --> 02:45:40.540]
Because if you don't get it today, you're not going to do the show tomorrow.

[02:45:41.580 --> 02:45:43.960]
That's right. If I don't get that checked today, I'm not going to be here tomorrow.

[02:45:44.180 --> 02:45:44.500]
That's right.

[02:45:46.540 --> 02:45:47.840]
And maybe not Thursday either.

[02:45:48.020 --> 02:45:49.480]
See, you thought you were going to go further with that?

[02:45:49.620 --> 02:45:49.820]
Yeah.

[02:45:49.980 --> 02:45:50.720]
Hey, don't go overboard.

[02:45:51.140 --> 02:45:51.700]
Go crazy.

[02:45:52.940 --> 02:45:54.660]
I mean, what kind of bunch of garbage is this?

[02:45:54.700 --> 02:45:56.060]
This is what happens when you...

[02:45:56.060 --> 02:45:58.200]
It's just like the thing with a pull crisis, the same thing.

[02:45:58.500 --> 02:46:01.600]
When you give complacent and you assume that they're going to do, you know,

[02:46:01.600 --> 02:46:03.600]
like things that ordinary, like real business people do.

[02:46:03.900 --> 02:46:06.400]
All of a sudden, no surprise, no paycheck on payday.

[02:46:06.760 --> 02:46:07.480]
Bites you in the ass.

[02:46:08.960 --> 02:46:09.640]
Joe Bell.

[02:46:10.820 --> 02:46:13.680]
This is not my idea of the way things are supposed to be, okay?

[02:46:14.060 --> 02:46:15.100]
I mean, yesterday was the night.

[02:46:15.100 --> 02:46:17.580]
They had plenty of opportunity to mail it on Friday or whatever.

[02:46:17.820 --> 02:46:18.780]
So we'll show up there yesterday.

[02:46:19.040 --> 02:46:20.900]
Or maybe like the 10th, which is today's payday.

[02:46:22.380 --> 02:46:23.680]
But here we go again.

[02:46:23.840 --> 02:46:26.480]
Beasley be once again wearing their ugly head.

[02:46:27.120 --> 02:46:28.780]
And there's nothing worse than ugly head.

[02:46:28.940 --> 02:46:30.200]
Believe me when I tell you, I should know.

[02:46:31.380 --> 02:46:31.880]
We all know.

[02:46:32.740 --> 02:46:33.880]
Now, what is that all about?

[02:46:34.080 --> 02:46:35.280]
That paycheck has got to be there.

[02:46:35.820 --> 02:46:37.260]
I want you to go into a county.

[02:46:37.600 --> 02:46:40.400]
And I want you to carry on like, mumple still skin and heat.

[02:46:40.500 --> 02:46:42.160]
I want you to start throwing crap.

[02:46:42.360 --> 02:46:44.120]
I want you to like turn desks upside down.

[02:46:44.300 --> 02:46:47.460]
Then I want you to go into Joe Bell's office and say, hey listen, you fat effort.

[02:46:48.100 --> 02:46:49.560]
You try to get them fired like croak?

[02:46:49.940 --> 02:46:50.360]
Pinday Ho.

[02:46:51.080 --> 02:46:54.500]
Now I'm only going to be gentlemanly when I go over that department.

[02:46:54.620 --> 02:46:54.880]
That's right.

[02:46:54.940 --> 02:46:57.920]
Well, I appreciate your efforts in advance.

[02:46:59.640 --> 02:47:00.440]
Thank you.

[02:47:02.780 --> 02:47:05.260]
Always some excitement when you work for these bastards folks.

[02:47:05.380 --> 02:47:07.660]
Let me tell you right now there's always like a little bit of excitement.

[02:47:07.800 --> 02:47:09.440]
Oh well, a payday, what's that?

[02:47:10.140 --> 02:47:11.220]
Expect us to pay you.

[02:47:11.300 --> 02:47:12.260]
You barely even working out.

[02:47:12.360 --> 02:47:12.940]
That's right.

[02:47:13.980 --> 02:47:14.780]
That's a good excuse.

[02:47:15.300 --> 02:47:16.120]
153 a.k.a.

[02:47:16.260 --> 02:47:18.420]
And this is to be warned for the late nights in the weekend hours.

[02:47:18.920 --> 02:47:19.340]
Go back.

[02:47:25.420 --> 02:47:26.940]
No ticking or lousy, baby.

[02:47:27.020 --> 02:47:27.600]
That's way it works.

[02:47:28.380 --> 02:47:28.760]
Read your text.

[02:47:29.940 --> 02:47:30.660]
I beg your pardon?

[02:47:30.860 --> 02:47:31.620]
Read your text message.

[02:47:59.320 --> 02:48:00.300]
I beg your pardon?

[02:48:02.360 --> 02:48:05.000]
I beg your pardon?

[02:48:06.780 --> 02:48:07.700]
I beg your pardon?

[02:48:07.700 --> 02:48:08.100]
I beg your pardon?

[02:48:08.100 --> 02:48:08.100]

[02:48:08.160 --> 02:48:08.600]
I beg your pardon?

[02:48:08.600 --> 02:48:09.280]
I beg your pardon?

[02:48:09.920 --> 02:48:10.720]
I beg your pardon?

[02:48:10.740 --> 02:48:11.580]
I beg your pardon?

[02:48:12.160 --> 02:48:13.000]
I beg your pardon?

[02:48:13.000 --> 02:48:13.960]
I beg your pardon?

[02:48:13.960 --> 02:48:14.120]
I beg your pardon?

[02:48:14.120 --> 02:48:14.900]
I beg your pardon?

[02:48:14.900 --> 02:48:16.380]
I beg your pardon?

[02:48:16.380 --> 02:48:16.940]
I beg your pardon?

[02:48:16.940 --> 02:48:16.960]
I beg your pardon?

[02:48:16.960 --> 02:48:17.220]
I beg your pardon?

[02:48:17.220 --> 02:48:17.340]
I beg your pardon?

[02:48:17.340 --> 02:48:18.520]
I beg your pardon?

[02:48:18.820 --> 02:48:20.820]
I beg your pardon?

[02:48:20.880 --> 02:48:21.300]
I beg your pardon?

[02:48:21.300 --> 02:48:21.360]
I beg your pardon?

[02:48:21.420 --> 02:48:22.600]
I beg your pardon?

[02:48:22.600 --> 02:48:22.900]
I beg your pardon?

[02:48:22.900 --> 02:48:24.020]
I beg your pardon?
