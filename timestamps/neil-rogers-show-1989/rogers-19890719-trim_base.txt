[00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:02.000]
Bill Tanner from Power.

[00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:04.160]
Anyway, oh, we never ordered lunch.

[00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:06.840]
Well, they're just going to bring a bunch of stuff by.

[00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:08.080]
We don't want to get picky, okay?

[00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:09.520]
Because at this point, we're getting really depressed.

[00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.040]
We had a down button for the first time in ages

[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.080]
from a 7-3 to a 6-3.

[00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:16.700]
I remember the last down book.

[00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.000]
That's where ever been a down book?

[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:19.780]
Oh, yeah.

[00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.560]
We went from that 9-2-5.

[00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:22.300]
Oh, that's right.

[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.360]
You don't go up forever.

[00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:24.720]
You've got to add a little bit.

[00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.760]
But I'm looking at the WIOG-12-plus last spring,

[00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.600]
stationed at a 3-2, and this year we got a 4-7.

[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.340]
So that's not chopped liver.

[00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:34.140]
Oh, no, no.

[00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:34.900]
Still pretty good.

[00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.360]
But anyway, June, we got screwed in there badly

[00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:39.580]
in the diaries evidently.

[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.540]
Either that or we're just doing a lot of things wrong.

[00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.120]
We're going to have to have a lot of seminars and start

[00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.200]
to re-examine, do a lot of heavy topics

[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.200]
and bring a lot of ministers and do stuff like that.

[00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.740]
And here's your lander with more, even more number.

[00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:53.380]
Thank you.

[00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.200]
Here's midday again.

[00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.140]
Oh, yeah, there it is.

[00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.900]
He didn't make it up 07-3 to a 6-3.

[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.120]
Our CUNE dropped 37,000 people.

[00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.620]
See, I don't buy that.

[00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.540]
I think this is a June is a statistical thing.

[00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:10.120]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.800]
Because life, look at life, 8-4 to a 10-6 in midday.

[00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:16.380]
Crazy.

[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.560]
Incredible.

[00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.100]

[00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.200]
Magic from a 4-9 to a 5-5.

[00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.800]
Now, let's see.

[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.320]
How did this, this is 12-plus.

[00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.380]
How did GTR do midday?

[00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:27.740]
4-1 to a 3-7.

[00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.420]

[00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.180]
We'll see a 4-4 to a 3-6 while a 100-3-2 to a 3-7.

[00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:33.940]
Love 94-3-5 to a 2-9.

[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.080]
How did you delve into it in the morning?

[00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.660]
By the way, on Love 94-12-plus.

[00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.560]
3-0 to a 1-2-4.

[00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:41.360]
Yikes.

[00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.480]
Love to a 3-2-2-5.

[00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.480]

[00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.660]
Sandy went from a 3-2 to a 2-5.

[00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.540]
Winds went from a 2-2 to a 1-8.

[00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.800]
Hmm.

[00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.060]
Zeta stayed flat with a 1-7.

[00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.480]
Edgar can flat.

[00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.080]
Consistent as the rocket you brought it.

[00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.600]
Always.

[00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:56.980]
Oh.

[00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.800]
Let's see.

[00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.620]
W. The motivation station showed up in midday with a 0.5.

[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.900]
What did QIM do in the morning in 12-plus?

[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.960]
We got to get that number.

[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.660]
We got to find that number.

[00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.200]
They're at 0.6.

[00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.340]
For Dick fatherly and whoever else was on part of that thing.

[00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.560]
It's 10-49, 11-4-11 here at WI-O-D-Boy.

[00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:19.260]
Really depressing.

[00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.540]
We're going to have a morbid day.

[00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.260]
I should have known the way they started it down.

[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.900]
It was going to be really, really.

[00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.140]
It was a pall over the bill.

[00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.000]
A morbid and depressing dropping a full point like that.

[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.240]
Boy, that's really desperate.

[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.180]
When Erie stayed about the same, he went from what I say is 6-5-9.

[00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.960]
So he's right there, always, Mr. Consistency.

[00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:36.480]
And no.

[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.180]
No, no, no, Gonser.

[00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:38.240]
Yeah.

[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.680]
Who is?

[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.760]
That's a big word.

[00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.540]
10-4-11 at WI-O-D and we want to talk now about.

[00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:45.200]
Phyam's dog.

[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.380]
Okay.

[00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.760]
Well, it's that time of the show when we start eating again.

[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:49.420]
That's another thing.

[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:50.640]
Too much of that eating on here.

[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:51.240]
No, wrongly.

[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:52.720]
Bad radio.

[00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.220]
Let's get back to the business of more of those draft shows.

[00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:57.680]
That's where it's at.

[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.520]
We could do the soccer draft in these hours.

[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:02.860]
We'd have like a 92-share.

[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.240]

[00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:06.380]
Hmm.

[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:07.640]
Where's the good sound?

[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:08.320]
That's the sound of it.

[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.020]
We got stuffed shells, meatballs.

[00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.560]
What is it?

[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.300]
Is that the cheesecake that I was talking about?

[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.440]
Yeah.

[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.360]
I'm going to talk about that wine that you're drinking.

[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.140]
Wait, we have this.

[00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:19.260]
We had this last week.

[00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:20.160]
This is incredible.

[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.900]
That's the heat-park front piece.

[00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:23.420]
Oh, that's incredible.

[00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:24.780]
That's incredible.

[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.100]
And Sharon keeps coming in with these insipid facts.

[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.280]
Oh, yeah.

[00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:32.280]
It says, though, we were sorry to see that you took a slight hit in the book.

[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.540]
WGTR took a bigger one in another venue.

[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.120]
It seems that they have been dropped from radio and records as a reporter.

[00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.800]
Right.

[00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:47.300]
It says, apparently, slight press election for old music caused R&R to reassess his status.

[00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.600]
And GTR has now considered a classic AOR.

[00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.620]
It is.

[00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:53.940]
What a bitter pill it says.

[00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.340]
Love and Kiss and the Phantom.

[00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:56.300]
Phantom informer.

[00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:58.860]
Who has given us a good information, by the way.

[00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:04.080]
Give us the real lowdown on Zeta when we were going on.

[00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.340]

[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.440]
Bad information.

[00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.520]
Yeah, that thing wise didn't mention that.

[00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:11.680]
I haven't noticed Dennis Rees called back to apologize for all the bad information he gave us.

[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.060]
Oh, I remember that.

[00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:14.640]
I mean five.

[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.680]
Well, you was like in Twilight's show.

[00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:17.320]
Oh, shit.

[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:20.340]
Well, look at this guy.

[00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:24.260]
He just got everything all the way down here with real plates and real, who are not used to this?

[00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:25.600]
The tentals from Pizza Law.

[00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.360]
Yeah, we were all kinds of sodas.

[00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.960]
Yeah, I noticed.

[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.700]
Trust me.

[00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:32.620]
Okay, it's 11.38.

[00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.460]
And we got a mobile and Broward that I'm sure is long gone.

[00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.760]
Hello.

[00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:40.540]
Same old, same old belch and...

[00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.700]
Yep.

[00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.800]
That's what happens.

[00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.580]
Bad radio.

[00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:43.180]
I know.

[00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.040]
It'll do it every time.

[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.620]
It's a shame because I fit into that demographic.

[00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.320]
It's 1,500 to 5.

[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:50.380]
I'm right there.

[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.740]
Now, we're aiming for a little older demographic.

[00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:54.440]
We want the WOLD audience.

[00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:55.360]
95 plus.

[00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:57.240]
I'll tell you that.

[00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:58.020]
I think it's going to change.

[00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:00.280]
They're going to go even higher than that.

[00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:00.720]
Yeah.

[00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.040]
Yeah, they got a special category.

[00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:05.580]
They're going to put an arbitrage for Muthuzla.

[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.180]
Neil, you're crazy.

[00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.480]
I can't imagine why everybody is not listening to this.

[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.540]
You know, if you want to brighten up your day,

[00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.200]
you can put a smile on your face and forget the troubles of the world.

[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:17.580]
Yeah.

[00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:18.560]
This is the stage.

[00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:19.260]
This is it.

[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:19.800]
Oh, I know.

[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.120]
Well, don't worry about that.

[00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.360]
You know, if it was the whole three trends,

[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:24.620]
I'd have been a little bit nervous.

[00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.180]
But when it's one month, we don't worry about it.

[00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:28.180]
Well, it's vacation time.

[00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:28.660]
Yeah.

[00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:30.400]
There's nobody here in case you have a notice.

[00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:31.440]
Well, that's true.

[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:32.000]
Okay.

[00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:32.960]
Have a good one.

[00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:33.540]
Thank you.

[00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:33.740]
5.

[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.800]
21 till noon at WLD.

[00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.460]
Here's 18 to 34 midday.

[00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:39.520]
Now, how come we're getting this now

[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.340]
and spike-wise headed an hour ago?

[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:42.200]
Remember?

[00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:42.960]
Oh, yeah.

[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:44.340]
Hot had a 13.

[00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:45.200]
They were flat.

[00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:50.520]
GTR down sharply from a 10-8 to a 9.

[00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.700]
The hour is 6-5 to a 7-4.

[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.400]
We went from a 6-1 to a 7-1.

[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.240]
So we went up a point in 18 to 34s in the last book.

[00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:05.300]
Are you following me or are you just going to stuck your face?

[00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:06.340]
Are you paying any attention?

[00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.040]
I hear every number with the decimal point that you're going to find.

[00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:10.700]
Oh, you don't.

[00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:11.500]
Yes, I do.

[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:12.960]
We went up a point.

[00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:14.320]
That's great.

[00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.520]
Midday, love 94 from a 6-2 to a 4-8.

[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:18.580]
18 to 34.

[00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:19.460]
Well, that's not a jam.

[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:22.140]
Zeta 4-2 to a 4.

[00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:25.740]
That's 18 to 34.

[00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:26.900]
How did she do it?

[00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:29.120]
In midday, he asked.

[00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:31.700]
Not on the second page.

[00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:34.680]
Oh, they've got to be, aren't they?

[00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:36.300]
They're not on...

[00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:36.800]
Oh, they're there.

[00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:38.220]
They're all listening to this.

[00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.200]
Listen to this fight wise.

[00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:41.980]
Uh-oh.

[00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:44.200]
Ten a.m. to 3 p.m. 18 to 34.

[00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.680]
She went from a 2-7 to a 5-7.

[00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:47.800]
Good lord.

[00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:49.360]
Whoa.

[00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:53.040]
I wonder what they did in the morning before I heard him in the McQueen better watch it.

[00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:57.020]
In those bonded 18 to 34s where they had like a deathmell.

[00:06:58.380 --> 00:06:59.560]
Deathwish in the morning.

[00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:02.540]
Here it is 18 to 34 GTR from a 12 to a 10.

[00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:05.780]
And she from a 3 to a 4-5.

[00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:06.540]
They're creeping.

[00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:08.460]
Creeping ever so slowly.

[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:09.600]
Kind of like wins.

[00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:13.740]
Who did make it, by the way, I know.

[00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:16.640]
Probably everybody in the audience, that's what they really tuned in for today.

[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:19.640]
25 to 54 middays.

[00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:21.280]
W-I-N-Z did make it.

[00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:22.840]
They did make the last trend.

[00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:24.960]
It shows you never depend on those trends.

[00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:26.880]
They...

[00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:28.440]
Oh, that's men.

[00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:29.520]
That's not even the right sheet.

[00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:30.440]
They had a pointy.

[00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:32.160]
All right.

[00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:32.860]
Isn't that good?

[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:33.640]
Great.

[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:34.700]
I'm...

[00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:35.040]
I'm weird.

[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:36.620]
I just want to verify.

[00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:37.900]
Just one moment please.

[00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:39.640]
Much more than I expect.

[00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:42.640]
QAM at a point seven on the bottom.

[00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:47.220]
A motivation station at a point seven and RAC had a point seven.

[00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:49.180]
W-I-N-Z beat them all with a point eight.

[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:52.540]
Isn't that good?

[00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:54.480]
A point eight.

[00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:56.360]
25 to 54s in midday.

[00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:57.500]
We can't make puns for many.

[00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:58.500]
So I don't feel so bad.

[00:07:58.620 --> 00:07:59.520]
We still had a good number.

[00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.480]
Of course, they're going to be in the upper office.

[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.180]
I'm telling you.

[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:12.220]
Same old party operation.

[00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:13.360]
Same old party.

[00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:14.140]
Same old party.

[00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:16.280]
Thank you.

[00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:18.160]
Thank you so much.

[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:18.780]
Look at that.

[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:20.500]
Well, you went crazy.

[00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:23.020]
Okay.

[00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:23.680]
Thanks for being here.

[00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:23.960]
Oh yeah.

[00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:27.060]
Of course, that could.

[00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:28.560]
Anyway, it's 11-42.

[00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:30.080]
At least one thing we can always eat.

[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:30.500]
Yeah.

[00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:32.060]
You always said that.

[00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:32.460]
No matter what we're talking about,

[00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:32.460]

[00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:32.460]

[00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:32.460]

[00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:32.460]

[00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:32.460]

[00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:32.460]

[00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:32.460]

[00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:32.460]

[00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:32.460]

[00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:32.460]

[00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:35.720]
we're always going to be able to eat.

[00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:37.180]
So we won't starve.

[00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:38.000]
Long's we got a job.

[00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:43.560]
For those meatballs and prebi-

[00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:44.740]
Look at all that pizza.

[00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:48.080]
How come the people aren't coming in to eat?

[00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:50.440]
There's only three pizzas here.

[00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:51.960]
Yeah, there's three pizzas.

[00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:54.020]
I want one slice of that pepperoni.

[00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:54.600]
It looks great.

[00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:56.200]
And that's it.

[00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:58.920]
And we got all these mushrooms here too.

[00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:00.840]
Which I don't know why we're letting them sit there

[00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:01.580]
and kind of go to waste.

[00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:02.380]
No, you know.

[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:03.660]
Kind of foolish, isn't it?

[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:06.040]
Anyway, we'll get to you when we're good and ready.

[00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:08.320]
Both the bokeh and the pomegranate are open,

[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:10.340]
which I guess is kind of a, um,

[00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:11.460]
ties right in.

[00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:12.260]
Yeah.

[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:14.580]
With everything else that's going on here today, doesn't it?

[00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:17.800]
Why don't you take a pizza, Andy?

[00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:19.660]
Yeah, why don't you take one of the fries?

[00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:20.480]
We're going to be great.

[00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:22.040]
Like, take a pizza.

[00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:23.740]
Oh, it's like, take two of them.

[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:26.260]
Leave that one there, because I like the looks of that one.

[00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:27.680]
Just take these two.

[00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:28.420]
Go nuts.

[00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:29.780]
And go crazy with them.

[00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:34.560]
And then you can just take a look at the food.

[00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:36.500]
And then you can just take a look at the food.

[00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:36.500]

[00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:36.500]

[00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:37.500]
And then you can just take a look at the food.

[00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:38.240]
And then you can just take a look at the food.

[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:39.240]
And then you can just take a look at the food.

[00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:40.540]
And then you can just take a look at the food.

[00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:43.520]
And then you can just take a look at the food.

[00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:48.620]
And then you can just take a look at the food.

[00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:51.780]
And then you can just take a look at the food.

[00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:56.340]
And then you can just take a look at the food.

[00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:58.280]
And then you can just take a look at the food.

[00:09:58.280 --> 00:09:59.760]
And then you can just take a look at the food.

[00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:01.940]
Okay, let's look at that.

[00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:03.160]
The Palm Beach lines are going.

[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:04.560]
And everybody's having a nice day.

[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:05.720]
And everybody's having a nice day.

[00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:06.140]
Everybody get out of here.

[00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:07.600]
Let's go to Miami.

[00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:08.000]
Hello.

[00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:09.520]
I feel.

[00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:09.980]
Yeah.

[00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:13.140]
I think I know where you had to drop on your radio.

[00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:15.320]
Okay, let's analyze this now, Sir.

[00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:17.160]
We have to leave our rear wheel.

[00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:17.820]
We have to leave our rear wheel.

[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:18.720]
We have to leave our rear wheel.

[00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:19.160]

[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:20.900]
We have to leave our rear wheel.

[00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:23.560]
He could have been the one that knocked you all down.

[00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:24.060]
Yeah.

[00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:25.220]
No?

[00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:26.960]
Probably.

[00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:27.820]
Probably.

[00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:32.440]
Whatever you say sir. Let me ask another question. If you eat that's bad radio, right?

[00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:34.140]
Mm-hmm. How about if they eat you?

[00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:36.740]
I don't know radio. That's even worse. That's even worse?

[00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:41.040]
Then you get a memo, right? Yeah. Okay. Well I want to call somebody

[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:45.440]
bill the electrician that may or the douchebag. Mm-hmm. And that's about it.

[00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:47.840]
Okay sir. All right. See ya.

[00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:53.300]
Sixteen-tailed noon at WIOD. What did you just do?

[00:10:55.060 --> 00:11:01.360]
Oh well thank you so much. Isn't that cute? Or scratching stuff off and chasing

[00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:08.220]
changing stuff around and it's just bizarre. Anyway we got like four three four

[00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:10.780]
stick and calls on the board. I don't know what's happening with the phone. It's

[00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:13.920]
going nuts and nuts. The same time that everybody came in and disrupted the show.

[00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:19.820]
Mm-hmm. And I'm just lost. Me too. But you know something I'm eating here and I don't

[00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:26.340]
really give a plan. I'm having a great time. Food is wonderful. I couldn't give a damn

[00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:33.260]
less. Oh here have some of these mushrooms. Because I know you're like those before they

[00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:40.240]
all come in and start going crazy here. Yeah. Anyway it's quarter to

[00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:45.480]
noon at WIOD. Steve today's got open phones. Thank God for that. Hank Goldberg on

[00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:50.680]
sports talk tonight. Hank is going to be eating during sports talk. We got the

[00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:54.480]
Yankees in a white sauce today to talk and then of course after the ball game we

[00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:58.760]
got what's the question which I can't wait. How did we do it tonight? We went up at

[00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:04.840]
night. Yeah. Well there you go. I don't know I got too many sheets here. I got just

[00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:09.680]
tons and tons of stuff. They went from a two seven to a four two or something

[00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:13.060]
like that at night and twelve plus. Isn't that great? We're really doing it seven

[00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:17.860]
a midnight. Boy in a weekend. This station I told you we need bumper stickers that say

[00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:23.640]
the weekends are deadly at WIOD. We had one five on the weekend. The whole station

[00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:28.680]
that's Saturday and Sunday at one five. That's like almost Zato like. In fact I bet

[00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:37.060]
today beat us. Would that be in fair or less? No I bet today. Guaranteed. Guaranteed. I mean

[00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:41.880]
when you got a one five anywhere you know everybody in the world here it is weekend twelve

[00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:49.140]
plus. Hot hot like number one in almost every category everywhere. Winds had a three

[00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:55.840]
on a weekend. I. O. D. Oh I'm sorry it was a two three. I apologize wasn't that bad.

[00:12:55.920 --> 00:13:03.760]
No Azeta had a two. I told you not to over read WS news had a two two but it is Zato

[00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:07.480]
like. Which Debbie Ellis is going to be wearing during her show which he moves to mid

[00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:11.040]
days going to be wearing that two two. Well we do have some big competition coming

[00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:16.520]
on. We got a call from Maryland. Hello. Hello. What are you doing? All right. How are you?

[00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:21.820]
Oh we're great. How was your vacation? Terrific. I'm going back tomorrow. Where did you

[00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:27.680]

[00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:34.460]

I feared a house tomorrow. Really? Yeah. Well how do you present? Oh yeah this three out

[00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:44.700]

[00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:49.980]
call remember? That's right. Yeah. We were shocked and out of town called it actually

[00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:56.460]
the guy had something to say. Yeah. I'm finding my way around this place that's a band

[00:13:56.460 --> 00:14:01.600]
turned me under that radio station. That's pretty good. Nothing like you guys. To what

[00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:09.340]
station? B. A. M. Oh yeah. Stand was here. Alan Brown right? Oh yeah. Fair. You know

[00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:17.140]
I know of him. Yeah. Anyhow. We. We. We. And then literally I went down to the

[00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:23.960]
separately that he told me to go to and that's by faith. Was it good? Yeah. Yeah. What

[00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:32.420]
happened? And this is uh. Yeah. Very. Baltimore? Yeah. Can't stand it. But then

[00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:37.800]
the radio was a hot. Yeah. That's true. By the way Ed Kaplan on Q. A. M. What's that?

[00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:20.980]
The big mushrooms. One lasagna and they've got fantastic spaghetti and that great pugazza pizza

[00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:26.180]
that layered pizza with a real spicy sauce and the thin onions and all like good stuff inside of

[00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:31.660]
it like a triple decker and Sicilian pan pizza and calzones and the you name it they got it along

[00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:36.640]
with all kinds of unique and different toppings some of which will scare the daylights out of you.

[00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:41.180]
Okay. They really do a great job. Everything is fresh. It's delicious and the price is right. They

[00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:45.700]
even deliver and when they deliver to you if you're a real slipper you can even use your credit

[00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:50.920]
cars and the pay for it. How do you like that? Pizza law they're upstairs at 69th Avenue in West

[00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:55.380]
Flaglissery just east of the Palmetto and we thank Jeff and the gang over there for putting together

[00:16:55.380 --> 00:17:00.760]

Anyway you stop by for a great lunch or dinner anytime to the pizza law.

[00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:20.320]
You know what they do is they put it in a bottle and they put it in this game bay and we got an

[00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:25.320]
advantage because we're right on the water back here. So your land that goes back in with a fish net

[00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:32.440]
and gets scooped it out of the bay. He's got real bitter death. Okay well that's it. Okay.

[00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:40.400]
Bye. See ya. What a call huh. Miami hello. Hey you hung up on me. What do you mean by that?

[00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:49.800]

[00:17:53.340 --> 00:18:10.220]
No. Yeah. Is this heal? Yeah. Is it heal? Oh it's not? What's happening here? This is

[00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:14.340]

[00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:20.480]

[00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:27.060]

[00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:33.100]
piece of style pizza just a regular style. It's from W.I.N.V. Oh you don't want to be eating

[00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:37.080]
any of that now. You get to be careful. You got to get yourself to make you are. In fact

[00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:42.820]
the auntie there's a little bitter pill on his slice. And you know what I did here that Bill

[00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:47.060]
can't have calling you with their numbers now. How they have to get their numbers before you got

[00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:51.980]
their numbers. Because he's the guy that makes them up. I got shocked when I heard that. I want to know.

[00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:56.900]
Yeah. Anyway he's been a long time since I see you at from you know when he used to work over

[00:18:56.900 --> 00:19:02.060]
there that other radio stations of the I and Z you still look the same. Yeah. All right then

[00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:05.860]
why don't you fat enough to tell you no matter what anybody tell you about you going down.

[00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:10.360]
Let me tell you they all wrong. You're going up. I'm listening to you right now. Okay.

[00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:14.420]
Lee right. Okay. Peace to everybody. Listen and you're right. Just get down. You're

[00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:21.180]
walking at loose now. Whoa man. I told you that station was just for people on drugs.

[00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:28.140]
No certainly you got to be on drugs to your hot 105. Yeah. That's it. That's it.

[00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:33.680]
And it's like between them and life. It's like the two extremes of the spectrum. Yeah.

[00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:39.000]
It's for people who are just beyond the cradle on the one hand and people who are

[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:46.560]
have got a foot and a half in the grave on the other hand. It's true. But anyway we're just going to

[00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:53.540]
boycott this whole book. Really right. We're going to make up a lot of excuses and a lot of

[00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:58.260]
alibi. We did pretty damn good. Okay. They should kiss the ground or doing a six free here in midday.

[00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:01.500]
Oh yeah. Well it's no point. No.

[00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:12.920]
Paul I'll beat that. Yeah. I think those bumper stickers are probably what got us over the top.

[00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:24.020]
Don't you? They are beautiful. We got a promotion department here that Albert Einstein would

[00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:27.940]
be. We know how to promote the department. Don't we? No.

[00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:34.340]
Those t-shirts I like to like everything is like plain white and blue you know what I'm saying?

[00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:41.400]
Like real boring looking. It's real dynamic. It's kind of like a reflection of our general

[00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:50.680]
managers and a real dynamic like a dead toad. Anyway it's 1157 a WIOD here's plantation. Hello.

[00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:55.360]
Yeah. Neil how you doing? Welcome back. Yeah. I didn't get to you before you left.

[00:20:56.340 --> 00:21:03.040]
The day that you were at the Hollywood Toyota. I had an I'm a lot in plantation too and I had to pass

[00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:10.260]
by where Y100 was and there wasn't two people there. No not Y100. Yeah. Y100. No Zeta.

[00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:15.420]
No but Y100 also were out there. Oh they also had one where? I don't know. They were at the

[00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:19.860]
Dodge Place on University. The Dodge Place. The Dodge Place.

[00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:22.100]
Between Sterling and the

[00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:26.680]
between Sterling and the

[00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:30.220]
between the Hard Place. Between Griffin and Sterling on the

[00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:35.260]
on the University. Nobody there. And there was nobody there and that was in five minutes later

[00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:39.040]
I was over there as to you. Well maybe if Super Dave would have been here they would have had a

[00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:45.400]
big crowd. I have no life. Yeah not anymore. I'll tell you that's that's still in the morning

[00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:50.860]
on Y100 is Firmable. I already hit he could listen to it. Well they got a lot of them. I'll tell you

[00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:55.820]
that they're just going through the roof. They went from a from whatever the holiday went. I don't

[00:21:55.820 --> 00:22:00.760]
know. What did they do in 18 to 34? They just estimated they went from a 7-6 to a 6-1.

[00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:04.800]
Well your old pads would be the one for you. Yeah evidently that must be where their whole

[00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:10.580]
audience is is in pre-pube-best and pig maze I guess they must have all of them. That's mental

[00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:15.720]
pig maze. Exactly. Well everybody's out of town anyway I'm vacation you know it's the

[00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:20.140]
biggest vacation. Now we got a real screwing I'm going to say it right now because I've always said

[00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:23.760]
this over the years it's it's almost like picking them out of a head if you do well over a long

[00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:29.000]
period of time and you obviously got something going but in any given bookman these these samples

[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:37.320]
are so incredible that it just almost makes you speechless. That's a bad radio. Henry's having a good time.

[00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:43.200]
Well Raven's party. Yeah see Henry celebrates upbooks he celebrates

[00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:50.860]

[00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:33.460]

[00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:39.280]

[00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:47.860]
What a good way to go out you know. Okay here we got some 18 to 49 man we got everything here

[00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:54.080]
why even bother getting the book we got everything that's ever been invented we got men 18 to 34

[00:23:54.080 --> 00:24:02.880]
a lot of you can see this yet look at this. Men 18 to 34 midday we went from a 970 to an 113.

[00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:08.540]
Oh so our audience is just getting younger that's a good excuse we're just getting younger

[00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:13.980]
pretty soon we're going to put that stick in Y 100 off the mat right. So you get all those 10

Don't you feel the same way. I'm not saying anything. I don't think I have it.

[00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:52.340]
I can't imagine she's been coming in here back in fourth and back in boomers for hours and I

[00:24:52.340 --> 00:25:01.440]
can't believe I wouldn't have one thing. Here's the men 18 to 34 6 to 10 am hot had a 15.9 it's

[00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:19.140]

[00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:07.800]
You can't say that. Yeah you can say it in your house.

[00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:18.460]
Oh my boy. She's there. I had a dump there. She never fails to disappoint me. What a sicko huh?

[00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:27.660]

Rinerie head from a 4.7 to a 4.8. So we finally found somewhere where something and somebody

[00:26:42.820 --> 00:26:51.460]
on his station went up a little bit. Yeah. Look at that probation for oh she said it doesn't have

[00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:57.260]
anything to do with the newsroom. It's an outside matter. I see. Okay those two getting pretty

[00:26:57.260 --> 00:27:03.520]
chummy in there aren't they Miami? Hello. Yeah. Welcome back. Thank you so much.

[00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:08.000]
Bird did a great job in your absence. No question about it. Nice changes pace. Yeah.

[00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:15.760]
You have a nice trip. Great. How glad. Well that's good. Happy to be back. Yeah up until this call

[00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:19.000]
I was ecstatic. I've been told this call. First of all I see. Well I mean at

[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:23.440]
tone in your voice there's like a certain level of sarcasm there isn't there. No no I have to

[00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:28.660]
be not ecstatic. A little sarcasm in this call sir. No not at all. I sustained some permanent hearing

[00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:35.920]
loss when Steve got on the phone. Oh he talks very loud. Yeah. He does. He hangs out with

[00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:42.540]
Lee Fowler a lot. Kind of rubs off so to speak. I don't want our guest downstairs to get the wrong

[00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:47.720]
idea Roy Masters when I said it kind of rubs off. He gets real nervous when he uses an expression

[00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:54.680]
like that. So what's up sir. I just have a feeling that bubbling under the surface of this

[00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:59.160]
call or something that doesn't know. No absolutely not. No. No I was just caught off guard

[00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:06.180]
snapping. Oh. Was the. Are you want to go back on hold? No. Oh. As a matter of fact there is a point

[00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:11.080]
of information. How do you get on the lightning round without being kept on hold? You just call

[00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:17.280]
in and if you get a ring you'll get on. Okay. Very. Can you say hello? Hello and hang up on it.

[00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:24.220]
Oh very. You're repeated to Dion. Were you back in town Saturday? Yeah. You were. Did you

[00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:30.200]
relisten to the Dion show? No. No. When I'm on vacation I don't I don't get involved with this place.

[00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:35.120]
It was a great show. Yeah. Too bad they didn't play the tapes in the right order. Yeah but I've

[00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:40.600]
never listened to a single radio program twice and it was actually worth. Yeah Dion is great.

[00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:43.940]
Now that was a great show. No mistake. It was a great show. What about the cops?

[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:50.020]
Like you said. I think your right by hearing has been affected since Steve was in here.

[00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:54.000]
Yeah up until this call. It looks in there only three and a half games out there going through a

[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:58.660]
little problem you know it's called Lacka Runs. They're tied with a knife. Yeah. There you go.

[00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:02.700]
Montreal is going to take the good. Can I read you this thing out of this? Yeah. Well listen have a great day.

[00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:08.020]
Take care. Okay son. What was his story? Man use a live squirrel as windshield wimper. You get the

[00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:13.660]
feeling of something under that well what's wrong with that? He was using the tail. I can't

[00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:18.780]
visualize that what it was. Yeah. The fur was flying when eagle light police arrested a motorist

[00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:22.960]
for an unusual offense driving down the street with a live squirrel tied to his windshield wimper.

[00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:27.120]
What's wrong with that? Ashford, Massachusetts they charged 49 year old John Griffith with

[00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:32.380]
unlawful possession of a bushy tailed rodent. He just he was described as a loner who lives at

[00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:37.060]
a local campsite. He was irate and combative when officers pulled him over. He told the cops

[00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:43.400]
that the squirrel always accompanied him because he was his friend. Yeah. Police report that the

[00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:48.140]
squirrel who was tied to the wiper by an island. He was probably enjoying it. Was frightened but not

[00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:55.640]
hurt by the unusual auto trip. I gotta remember that. He said it was nothing compared to how when

[00:29:55.640 --> 00:30:03.120]
he puts him into watch the laundry and the dryer. One 19 at WIOD let's take a call from these calls

[00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:07.400]
today. I'm going to be honest with you boy. This has been real real eye opener for me all the way

[00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:12.240]
with his Monday. And we never gave the numbers out and they're all filled up which is a big deal I

[00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:17.340]
guess in his business. My Emmy. Hello. Hi. Hi. You're Neil. Yeah. How you doing? Joy.

[00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:22.760]
Hey. It's been a boring two week through the algebra. I'm going to throw you a good job. It's not the same.

[00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:27.480]
I know. Hey, I have a first request and then I want you to come from a rumor for me.

[00:30:28.580 --> 00:30:33.860]
Requester you can play a young Neil or freeway in spiket today. No. Okay. Catch you later on that man.

[00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:40.720]
Somebody said that Neil is black. Is that true? Who? Another Neely. He says I swear to God,

[00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:47.120]
Neil is black. I said no. He's not. Yeah. Neil is black. He doesn't sound black. Why are you talking to me

[00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:50.660]
and you're talking like you you're talking in the first person and now you're switching in the third

[00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:56.360]
person. Is there a special reason for that? No, because a good friend of mine told me that Neil is black.

[00:30:58.460 --> 00:31:07.140]
I heard the same thing. Yeah. Not in the up sorry Nick. Oh, Nick. Yeah. What?

[00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:14.080]
You're right about these calls. Wow. Oh, right. I should have kept telling my story about the plane trip

[00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:18.560]
back and about the Lebanese woman with the baby and the diaper. I should have continued on that story.

[00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:26.620]
These calls just stopped. 21 past one at WIOD. Lauder Hill. Hello. Hello. Yes.

[00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:32.260]
Hi Neil. I'm so glad you're back. I can't stop laughing. Really? I can't stop crying.

[00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:38.500]
You're absolutely wonderful. You know, those days especially at Amsterdam, I'd be sitting in my hotel room

[00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:43.940]
and I'd look out the window and it would be bitter cold and raining. Amsterdam is nice when the sun is

[00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:49.540]
shining and gets up to about 72. It never really gets hot there. But when it's raining, it gets real

[00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:55.360]
dark like up north. You know, when it rains and it gets cloudy all day and gray and it's bitter and

[00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:59.380]
I'd sit in that hotel room and I'd look outside. I think even though I can't go out walking or doing

[00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:05.200]
anything, it's just so nice being here and just being free. It's like a bird. You know what?

[00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:11.120]
If I can use that expression. Like total escape. And I would sit back down and turn on the TV and

[00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:15.840]
there would be Larry King and then I'd think, well, maybe I'm not so free after all. Well, now

[00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:22.440]
you're back to reality. Yeah. Part of your wake up. I just wanted to say that bird did an excellent job

[00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:26.020]
while you were gone. Well, we're going to take a four hour pull on it tomorrow.

[00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:32.200]
The last time you were gone, he wasn't so great. But this time I don't think he was as nervous and

[00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:35.960]
he was nervous. Yeah, last time I went, he was terrible. You were a sister. Sorry,

[00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:43.540]
bird. I love you, but sorry. Anyway, that you were so bad that the only day that wasn't good

[00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:47.820]
with that bathing suit contest was Stan. I can't believe you did that. I really can't because when

[00:32:47.820 --> 00:32:53.460]
Stan, when Stan did that on INZ, I ripped him for days. It was so bad and embarrassing. But you

[00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:59.280]
guys get away with murder. It was. And I have one thing to say about Steve. This is an arrest.

[00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:04.540]
This is an arrest. I just have one thing to say about Steve. You know, he said how you read your

[00:33:04.540 --> 00:33:11.980]
audience into Stan wrong. I would never take credit if that were you. Stan's audience was really

[00:33:11.980 --> 00:33:16.080]
bad. Those were not nearly people. Well, he had there was something there was some crossover,

[00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:22.940]
but no question Stan did have his own special group. I mean, floor mat. I mean, you know,

[00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:28.200]
he had those people that just, you know, he didn't he never had a show. He never had a show.

[00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:35.580]
He really did. I'm sorry. Well, at least he's consistent because he don't have a show now.

[00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:39.120]
He is. So, you know, there's something to be said for consistency. I have to tell you

[00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:43.800]
something when he was on that day, I had turned it on about, I don't know, 11 o'clock, 11

[00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:49.120]
30 in the morning. I got in the car and I turned it on. And for a minute, I thought it was you.

[00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:53.520]
It was just it was just the way it came on and the way happened to be listening to it. Yeah,

[00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:58.160]
Stan, I sound a lot of like. I know Neil's not back because of the new day and he

[00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:02.860]
rolled back to like three. And when he started with that business and all of a sudden, I heard

[00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:09.800]
that about Ricky Tickies, you know, lingerie and bathing suit and I know Ricky. Ricky Tickies,

[00:34:10.700 --> 00:34:14.920]
lingerie. Well, there must be something going on. I don't know about. I knew about the cat,

[00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:20.780]
but I didn't know about the lingerie. Well, anyway, it's been fun. Okay, listen, have a great day

[00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:25.980]
and I'll say hi to Stan for you. No, thank you. Okay. Wow. Boy, they're just ripping the crap out

[00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:31.940]
of everybody today, aren't they? 24 past one at WIOD. I think we're going to do a little break here

[00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:36.840]
and we got the boy, we got the lighting run. This is basically overall, this is great. So,

[00:34:36.980 --> 00:34:42.060]
all right, and you go on vacation, which is going to really be something. Yeah. Now, you're just,

[00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:45.180]
you're just not going to show up Friday, right? You're not going to tell anybody about that.

[00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:49.440]
That's correct. That's, that's the best way. Because you had a little run-in with Boy Geary who

[00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:53.880]
said that you can't take that extra day. I know. And you said you're just going to go ahead and

[00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:57.400]
take it anyway and you said, well, just don't tell anybody. Yeah. That's what he said. I said,

[00:34:57.400 --> 00:35:01.700]
so we're not going to tell anybody about it. He just won't show up on Friday. He won't be here. Okay,

[00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:05.180]
but whatever you do, don't tell anybody and we'll just pretend, you know, it's one of the, like,

[00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:09.960]
he's sick. So I'll make up a story like you're under the weather. How do you guys do it? Oh,

[00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:15.280]
you guys take that extra day. How do you guys do it? Because we're talent. Oh, oh, we'll see.

[00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:21.100]
They didn't tell me that. 25 at WIOD and we'll be right back. Good morning. I'm Henry Barrow in the

[00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:25.680]
six. I have to do whatever you want. I have a great time. Excellent. We talk about the CUB. Yeah.

[00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:30.560]
I won't think anything just like you. I won't think about the stage. Yeah. I'm specifically going

[00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:34.360]
to go where I can't hear it. Excellent. And you guys, you can do anything. By the way, I just want

[00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:39.860]
to mention the WIOD newsletter. I'm going to throw that out. Wow. Oh, geez. There's a new newsletter

[00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:44.820]
out while I was on vacation. Here it is. And wouldn't you know, we barely get any mention. It does

[00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:48.660]
mention you were going to be filling in for me. Yeah. You only mentioned this. I didn't get one.

[00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:56.160]
And see, I don't even get a clot. Listen to this. The 610 WIOD sports crew presented another great

[00:35:56.160 --> 00:36:05.240]
show for our audience on the recent NBA draft. It's Eric come a row.

[00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:11.200]
Sonny Hersh and Jim Manage provided pick by pick coverage. I wonder if they mean this.

[00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:18.020]
And the hang goldberg got the crowd reaction and official comments from the heat draft party at

[00:36:18.020 --> 00:36:23.900]
the mighty arena while Tony Yip, Marvin Raw man and Eric Martinez provided the

[00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:29.240]
produced the program. Keep it all. I can't even read this. I'm so tongue tied. It's so exciting.

[00:36:29.380 --> 00:36:34.240]
Keeping it all sounding great was Steve Ziegler because I'm in the second page. Yeah. Oh yeah.

[00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:41.240]
The radio at its finest. It does mention my name. That's a first. I don't forget the

[00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:46.200]
British cricket draft is coming up on Sunday and we're going to have Rick Weaver in Scotland.

[00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:51.440]
Man, I tried watching cricket for like five minutes on the BBC over there. How can they,

[00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:56.600]
how can you watch it? It is so ridiculous. One thing I've decided about the British. The reason

[00:36:56.600 --> 00:37:00.780]
they always they lose every war and we have to bail them out or they lost the revolution.

[00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:05.680]
Because they're silly. They're like silly people. Very silly. In fact, in Amsterdam,

[00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:10.920]
you know, they're people from all over the world there. It's incredible. And the only people

[00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:15.360]
that were really rowdy and loud and obnoxious, everywhere you went were the British kids.

[00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:22.860]
Really? Drunk, loud, obnoxious, disgusting. All of them. I mean, they were just disgusting.

[00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:27.920]
Out in the streets and restaurants everywhere you went, they were the only ones who just

[00:37:28.460 --> 00:37:33.340]
out of control. And when you stop at thing, I bet you that Roy Masters would probably have

[00:37:33.340 --> 00:37:37.680]
some comments on this. So seriously, in a country where they worship a queen, I'm telling you,

[00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:43.220]
there's just it's just a little peculiar, okay? And all the, well, I won't say it all, but most

[00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:50.220]
of the British men are like, fake, like, fay Wayne or fay Dunnoway. They're all a little

[00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:55.620]
fay. In fact, even the Dutch guys on the plane coming back, there was this Dutch family,

[00:37:56.320 --> 00:38:01.380]
husband and wife and two, the two, naughty little girls I was talking about. And the life was so

[00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:07.140]
butch man, she looked like she could put you through the four with her foot. And a husband

[00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:12.700]
looked just like, what's the queen's husband? What is his name? Prince Philip. Prince Philip.

[00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:19.580]
Is that his name? He looked just like him. And at same kind of very wimpy, ineffectual, you know what I mean?

[00:38:19.660 --> 00:38:23.060]
They've always been that way, don't you think? Yeah. Always been that way. Very strange.

[00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:30.940]
If you look at all British movies, 30s, 40s, they're all the same. You know, they are.

[00:38:31.780 --> 00:38:36.880]
I lost an old movie. So maybe Roy Masters can kind of penalize that for us on the King's show.

[00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:44.560]
Okay, it's 132 at WIOD. Let's go to senior. Hello. Get off the quick. Let's go to a plantation. Hello.

[00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:51.680]
Neil. Yeah. What? Hold on. Let's try Boka. Hello.

[00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:58.800]
Okay. Good. I forgot about this beginning of that desperate time of the show. It is that time.

[00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:05.680]
Miami. Hello. Hello. Neil. Are you holding? Yes. Hello. Yeah. Yeah. Hi Neil. I just want to say

[00:39:07.140 --> 00:39:11.780]
welcome back. Got you a little confused there. Yeah. That's all right. We're confused too.

[00:39:12.140 --> 00:39:18.560]
I just want to say welcome back and tell you that the bird did a good job. He was pretty good.

[00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:22.620]
Well, we're taking a five-part poll on it starting tomorrow. Well, this guy is incredible though.

[00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:29.380]
He's a little, he just freaks for Boka George. You know. He just has us, how does and,

[00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:35.500]
yeah, and easy circumstances here. You know, we kind of shaky gave us a heart attack,

[00:39:36.100 --> 00:39:43.920]
sort of speed. Really? Yeah, but the guy is, he's all right, but I don't know about him. He was not nervous

[00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:49.640]
when he was talking this time. He was a little, you know. I don't know. I don't see like I'm

[00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:56.160]
right. I should be, you know, like, you know. Yeah. Anyway, look, he, I don't know what he did with

[00:39:56.160 --> 00:40:01.580]
your cards, but at one time he was, he was really quite crazy with those things. He was playing him

[00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:07.780]
back and forth. He was complaining a little bit because obviously you have him in some sort of water.

[00:40:08.540 --> 00:40:13.940]
Well, he was fine. He's got him all in alphabetical order now. It's really great. I can't find a thing.

[00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:20.180]
But no, the show was, it was great. He did a good job, except for that time we had all those

[00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:25.900]
half-naked women and of course, half-naked women. Well, that's what he said. Well, that's good.

[00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:28.800]
Next week we're going to have a bunch of hot naked guys in here. It's going to be great.

[00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:31.760]
All right. I have a couple of friends that be interested in me. I'm sure you do.

[00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:35.020]
Okay, Neil. Have a good day. Okay. See you.

[00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:38.840]
134 W.I.N.C. We're getting ready now. Are you holding?

[00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:43.800]
Okay. See, I'm getting psyched now. I know which ones are holding for the lighting round.

[00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:49.240]
And that lady was holding most of them. Bokka is open. So let's do a little break and then when we

[00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:52.980]
come back, it'll almost be that time, right? In fact, it'll probably be that time because it's the

[00:40:52.980 --> 00:40:57.000]
shell spot. You know how long this is. It seems that after two years of telling everybody,

[00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:02.880]
I don't want to read this copy. This is that same awful copy. And the essence of it is that a lot

[00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:07.200]
of people think that it shows that you give your paper plates and plastic forks and spoons like we

[00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:11.160]
in here with everything. Yeah, because it's so inexpensive. Do you remember somebody came in one

[00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:16.520]
day and they brought us China? Oh, we didn't know how to act. I don't remember, but we didn't know

[00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:20.780]
how we didn't know what to do. That was incredible. I mean, we're not complaining because you know,

[00:41:20.780 --> 00:41:25.400]
we don't have people there to wash the dishes. All of we got, how about your land?

[00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:32.080]
He's got a lot of time. She's got a lot of time. I'm sure she's got plenty of experience.

[00:41:32.220 --> 00:41:37.640]
She could go down there kind of like during the noon hours. She could wash the dishes and we could

[00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:42.260]
have real silver and plates and stuff. Sure should be thrilled. Of course she would.

[00:41:42.380 --> 00:41:48.700]
Firstly, if it had WIOD, like embroidered on the thinner, anyway, shells uses real silverware.

[00:41:48.700 --> 00:41:53.580]
She took away abortion and homosexual this and homosexual land.

[00:41:54.080 --> 00:42:00.460]
Be pretty slim-picking wouldn't it? 23 till 2 at WIOD and

[00:42:00.460 --> 00:42:04.200]
let's see, West Palm, you're holding for lightning round? No. Oh, you're holding for us.

[00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:08.600]
You're first. Great. How you doing? What a call. Yeah. Nice talking to you.

[00:42:09.100 --> 00:42:15.560]
I had a radio option last week. I was listening to wind and I heard the one, huh?

[00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:21.720]
Yeah, I was one. I heard the sportscaster, this was Ron Harrison with saying,

[00:42:21.940 --> 00:42:28.340]
was talking about how Ron Gittery had been in doored 15-manageral changes with the near Yankees.

[00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:32.620]
He said, both kind of like being in a radio business, maybe a good station even will,

[00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:37.940]
and any kind of pregnant positive moved on. Like to hear a short term like that.

[00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:43.020]
Yeah. Well, he was trying to come over here a long time ago and just didn't work out.

[00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:50.400]
Well, he did a great job well. I'm going to take back and kneel and grab the hand of his ass.

[00:42:50.540 --> 00:42:54.420]
Thank you. Take care. See you. Bye-bye. Now, who's this on the bat line? Is that for us?

[00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:57.320]
Is he talking to somebody on the air? What?

[00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:02.540]
He's still talking to him. That exciting. There's somebody on the bat line.

[00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:06.840]
Nobody called him with the name of that movie. And you know why? Because most people don't have

[00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:11.160]
viewers' choice so they don't they don't know what I'm talking about. Well, you give so many clues.

[00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:15.060]
But when you do, you know, you always tune in the middle.

[00:43:15.140 --> 00:43:19.980]
Anybody who saw it. No, I've seen it twice. Anybody who saw it with no one I'm talking about.

[00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:25.040]
Oh, okay. It's about this young guy and his girlfriend. And she's plotting.

[00:43:25.860 --> 00:43:31.120]
In fact, he gets involved with this. I don't know if it's her mother or this older woman. And he's

[00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:36.820]
involved with both of them. And both of them are plotting with this woman's husband to kill him

[00:43:36.820 --> 00:43:40.780]
and collect his insurance money and pretend that it's the husband who dies.

[00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:45.900]
Oh, I see. And it's all out in the snow. They're out in a shed somewhere in a shack. I don't know.

[00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:52.280]
And it's incredible. It's bizarre. It seems like all the movies that I see on these pay-per-view

[00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:58.120]
channels are all really strange, weird. What was that one I was telling you about before I went

[00:43:58.120 --> 00:44:03.080]
away? He's put me in a darkness. Another bizarre movie. Miami, hello.

[00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:08.960]
Hey, Neil. Yeah. I was in the panhandle all last weekend. We had a rock station up in

[00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:13.500]
Bainby, Georgia and a rock station mobile. All of them are playing the crap out of that neon out.

[00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:18.740]
Great. Got to get these ones like one mobile. They're doing like power rotation or whatever you

[00:44:18.740 --> 00:44:24.480]
call it. Here at least once an hour. Good. And I was listening. I got back Saturday morning. I

[00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:29.620]
put your, you know, the best needle out. And I heard the second and the fourth hours

[00:44:29.620 --> 00:44:35.280]
were the same tape. I couldn't believe it. They finally got D on. He was on the first hour and he

[00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:39.520]
came back in the third. Wait a minute. The second and the fourth hour were the same tape. Oh,

[00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:43.960]
same thing. Good thing. We got running the board on a weekend here, man. It's like a disaster.

[00:44:44.440 --> 00:44:47.660]
I don't know. He was, I don't want to get anybody in trouble. But wouldn't it be nice if they

[00:44:47.660 --> 00:44:53.200]
gave these people a little training? Yeah, it was sure helpful. I was driving through Milton.

[00:44:53.420 --> 00:44:56.740]
I think I saw Cap Dave stand on the corner with his side. With his thumb out, yeah.

[00:44:56.740 --> 00:45:03.780]
Well, you're science. The only proof. I still love those new billboards. There's with the,

[00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:09.180]
you know, the call letters on the tombstone. That's my favorite. I should tell you something.

[00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:12.140]
Yeah. Okay. You can hold for light. Sure. No problem. Okay.

[00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:19.640]
140 at WIOD for Lauderdale. Hello. I'm holding. You're holding? Yes, sir. Okay. So it's

[00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:25.320]
squeezed too tight now. Would you mind tapping for me? Let's go to Miramar. Hello. Hello. Yeah.

[00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:30.100]
Also, you know that movie you were talking about? Yeah. I think I'm not sure about it. Isn't it

[00:45:30.100 --> 00:45:35.940]
called the No People or something? No. No. I'll think of one. It just came out. It came out a couple

[00:45:35.940 --> 00:45:42.880]
months ago. I don't know. It's called Ice People. No. Can I hold for light, Ram? Sure. Okay.

[00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:47.940]
You're going to be okay? Yeah. All right. Let's go to Miami. Hello. Hello. Neil. Yeah.

[00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:52.960]
Hi. Welcome back. Thank you. Hi, Bird. That was a good week you had there. I enjoyed it. Why is

[00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:57.340]
it such a bad connection? I don't know. Neil, because I'm calling long distance. Listen. Where are you?

[00:45:57.680 --> 00:46:03.700]
I'm a really enbrouwer. I'm a first time call. Oh, a brow. Well, I'd explain to you. Well, now,

[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:09.140]
you're a brow or two. You live there. But I'm listening. Neil, I had a human interest story written to

[00:46:09.140 --> 00:46:15.480]
me on Father's Day and mentioned beyond in there. Theon picked up the article and he called me. And we

[00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:20.480]
discussed the show that he was on your show. And we discussed how he just couldn't believe on an AM

[00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:27.040]
show that you know, I have to be in on that show that, you know, visiting with you guys and doing

[00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:32.960]
an AM show, talking about the record three, four days later. It's people from Amrister Records.

[00:46:33.180 --> 00:46:42.340]
I'm not mistaken. Arista. Arista. Amrister. Yeah. Right. Okay. He couldn't believe it. That's what's

[00:46:42.340 --> 00:46:48.060]
happening down there. Theon and plantation and Boca and South. They boom. Things are taken off. Yeah.

[00:46:48.060 --> 00:46:52.100]
Just boy, I got to tell Neil when I get a chance that that show was just unbelievable. The record

[00:46:52.100 --> 00:46:58.220]
is just when skyrocketing. Great. And eventually probably will get to you. No, he did tell us that. Yeah,

[00:46:58.300 --> 00:47:02.100]
he can't buy toilet of Hollywood and told us. Oh, did he really? Yeah. Because I had a conversation

[00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:07.400]
with him. He's nice and sky evolve. Yes, he is. Yeah. They had an article about me. Well,

[00:47:07.740 --> 00:47:13.960]
as as a Father's Day, I guess they made me father of the year down here. Great. And and theon

[00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:20.160]
picked up on it and and he just the nicest guy just called me and spoke to me for 25 minutes and

[00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:23.360]
I thought I just passed it out to you. We just got a lot of time on his hands. Are they

[00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:28.380]
Father? I said he's the hell of a guy. He sure was. He was on Letterman. Yeah. Yeah. He's been

[00:47:28.380 --> 00:47:34.340]
everywhere. He's back down to 22nd. I think Bird mentioned it on the 23rd. The 22nd, 23rd and 26. They

[00:47:34.340 --> 00:47:39.620]
want to have a half an hour on VH1 of Deon. All right. I didn't know that. Oh, they're going to run

[00:47:39.620 --> 00:47:44.520]
a continuous loop. Maybe a re four hours or so. Yeah, he's making a big comeback. It's good to see.

[00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:49.240]
Oh, he looks great to his fantastic and one hell of a good human being. Okay, listen, have a great day.

[00:47:49.660 --> 00:47:56.700]
Thank you much. See you. Bye bye. 143 at WIOD and I want to try to clarify this mess again. Yeah.

[00:47:57.400 --> 00:48:01.080]
At Charhut, well, yeah, the food at Charhut, you already know his fantastic. In fact, we had

[00:48:01.080 --> 00:48:05.940]
unsolicited call early in the show. Somebody called just to thank me for turning them on to Charhut.

[00:48:05.940 --> 00:48:10.180]
In fact, when I was over there in Amsterdam eating at those unmentionable places, I was saying,

[00:48:10.180 --> 00:48:14.240]
yeah, I wish there was a Charhut here, but you know, they haven't made it quite that far yet,

[00:48:14.360 --> 00:48:19.780]
but eventually they might because Charhut is growing like crazy. They want to, okay, I think we got

[00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:26.720]
a little bit more compression going here with a lumpy hill myself and gravelers. I got five. Hey,

[00:48:27.060 --> 00:48:34.220]
75 degrees in the magic city. Hey, we're broadcasting live. Hold on a second. Let me stop out of

[00:48:35.420 --> 00:48:42.220]
75 degrees in the magic city. Hills over great storm. Oh, I'm already on down. Come on down with it.

[00:48:42.360 --> 00:48:44.240]
We're going to get down to that. We're going to get down to that. We're going to get to that.

[00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:48.060]
Groovy. It's the right time. What the hell am I talking about?

[00:48:51.600 --> 00:48:55.380]
That's the one with a question mark on it. Oh, is it? Yeah. Now, do you know, did it happen

[00:48:55.380 --> 00:49:00.060]
while you were gone or before, before a stencil's not no longer with us? Did that happen while you

[00:49:00.220 --> 00:49:05.580]
were gone? Also, Steve's pencil was fired. He was fired. It's been for what? I don't know.

[00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:10.700]
I all I was told is he's no longer with us. This happened. Well, what was he on probation for?

[00:49:11.380 --> 00:49:13.920]
They didn't say that. This was a while ago. This happened.

[00:49:15.580 --> 00:49:21.180]
Steve's pencil was fired and gone for probably two weeks. He's a good guy. He was a good guy.

[00:49:21.300 --> 00:49:27.000]
He was one of the only handful of good people over next door. I agree. Are you serious?

[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:37.020]
Yeah. Yeah. I know. Oh, business. Okay. It's 147 at WIOD. It's at time that I've been just waiting

[00:49:37.020 --> 00:49:42.100]
two weeks for a boy. How did that survive two weeks without me? Dose of this every day.

[00:49:42.100 --> 00:49:49.180]
Dave County. Polking Niel was very close. Boca. Hey, bird. Have it. Some orange slice.

[00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:56.360]
Broward. This is Lee, baby. Since I need a job. Nobody knows what that means.

[00:49:56.580 --> 00:50:03.340]
Palm Beach. That means you're Pecker, bird. Dave. That's not a stretch mark on my bow.

[00:50:04.780 --> 00:50:09.820]
How did you do without this every day? How did you make it? Broward.

[00:50:09.820 --> 00:50:19.440]
I love her my fan. Yeah, I like that one. He can't live without me. He's here themselves real quick.

[00:50:19.940 --> 00:50:24.440]
Palm Beach. See the movie sensation of the summer. Steve,

[00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:30.060]
one pumpkin and then Joe Johnson and the war. The running. It is showing you.

[00:50:32.040 --> 00:50:36.000]
Boca. Hi, this is Michael Jackson. I can't slide under the doors well when I'm concentrated.

[00:50:37.580 --> 00:50:38.100]
Dave.

[00:50:41.900 --> 00:50:45.420]
Broward. Hi, Niel. Debbie L. Throwgan. How are you?

[00:50:56.280 --> 00:50:59.820]
Dave County. Hello. We're smart. I know the magic.

[00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:07.540]
Dave. Remember if you can't stand a draft, shut the damn door. Boca.

[00:51:12.720 --> 00:51:15.500]
Yeah, please don't remind me Palm Beach.

[00:51:15.620 --> 00:51:22.440]
Killers got the horse, sliced birds. Broward. Niel, still have a U.S.D. in one emoji.

[00:51:25.840 --> 00:51:29.560]
Oh, that's the interesting thing. I didn't see any condominiums over there.

[00:51:29.820 --> 00:51:34.120]
No kidding. I didn't see any huge groups of old people. Broward.

[00:51:34.540 --> 00:51:38.420]
It was amazing. Factor shock. Dave County. Hello.

[00:51:38.500 --> 00:51:41.680]
Niel, you're a stick little glue sitting there. Broward.

[00:51:41.860 --> 00:51:46.000]
I think it's not a frog in your throat. If you didn't... Dave.

[00:51:46.500 --> 00:51:47.320]
Get out.

[00:51:49.540 --> 00:51:53.960]
Broward. In the dictionary, under salivating a portion of picture of steep pain.

[00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:59.100]
Boca. Oh God, play more music. I can't stand a listen, you Glenn.

[00:52:00.180 --> 00:52:03.580]
That's your buddy. Your pal. Dave, hello.

[00:52:03.940 --> 00:52:05.760]
Thank God the queen's back.

[00:52:07.740 --> 00:52:10.800]
Broward. Allie, Allie, the Hollywood guard, your douchebag.

[00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:15.280]
Dave. You'll need to give me a hand with your footcloth.

[00:52:16.900 --> 00:52:20.360]
Broward. Okay, good one. Bomby.

[00:52:20.920 --> 00:52:24.380]
No mad, your douchebag. Boca.

[00:52:24.780 --> 00:52:26.160]
Get it quick. What's behind you?

[00:52:28.160 --> 00:52:29.760]
Broward. Niel, you're a dog.

[00:52:30.840 --> 00:52:34.040]
This is a good one. I heard an incredible story. It has yet to be

[00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:36.860]
substantiated about the dork lady. What?

[00:52:37.480 --> 00:52:40.620]
And if there were some people inside the building, some of the bureaucrats

[00:52:40.620 --> 00:52:42.160]
who wanted her to do an air check.

[00:52:44.260 --> 00:52:46.580]
Is this true? Do I have to?

[00:52:46.780 --> 00:52:51.200]
For the possibility of doing a weekend show, I'll talk to you about it later.

[00:52:52.140 --> 00:52:53.540]
I don't want to talk about it on the air.

[00:52:54.440 --> 00:52:57.600]
It's nothing to a barrison. It's nothing to a barrison.

[00:52:57.880 --> 00:52:59.300]
It's too embarrassing. It's little if nothing to it.

[00:52:59.720 --> 00:53:01.200]
Dave, hello. Where did you do that?

[00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:03.060]
Is Olivier dead or just acting?

[00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:05.400]
Broward.

[00:53:05.720 --> 00:53:06.600]
How is this going?

[00:53:06.780 --> 00:53:07.200]
Car guy.

[00:53:08.860 --> 00:53:09.300]
Broward.

[00:53:09.720 --> 00:53:10.200]
That's it.

[00:53:11.700 --> 00:53:12.140]
I'm going to get out of here.

[00:53:13.780 --> 00:53:14.740]
That was it.

[00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:16.020]
Palm Beach.

[00:53:16.220 --> 00:53:18.040]
Niel, what do you call a fountain or a gay bar?

[00:53:19.480 --> 00:53:19.880]
Boka.

[00:53:20.440 --> 00:53:22.060]
Louis Oliver. Get to work.

[00:53:24.280 --> 00:53:24.680]
Dave.

[00:53:25.740 --> 00:53:26.880]
Hey, the cops are up.

[00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:27.700]
Cups are up.

[00:53:28.660 --> 00:53:30.520]
It sounded like Harry with the sore throat.

[00:53:30.660 --> 00:53:34.480]
And then for he was so incoherited yesterday, he didn't at the end of the

[00:53:35.020 --> 00:53:35.880]
at the end of the game.

[00:53:36.100 --> 00:53:39.300]
He messed up and he was laughing and he forgot Dwayne's stats name.

[00:53:39.300 --> 00:53:41.040]
He didn't know what planet he was on.

[00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:42.960]
Dwayne's, I think I, Dwayne's stop.

[00:53:43.160 --> 00:53:44.660]
I think the pressure started to get to Harry.

[00:53:45.320 --> 00:53:46.120]
Dave County, hello.

[00:53:46.240 --> 00:53:48.420]
The third on I, 95.

[00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:50.080]
Weathe.

[00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:50.900]
Broward.

[00:53:51.260 --> 00:53:53.580]
Now you've had a taste and I mean taste of five bags.

[00:53:55.820 --> 00:53:56.340]
Boka.

[00:53:56.660 --> 00:53:58.440]
Welcome back from vacation, Niel.

[00:53:58.520 --> 00:53:59.380]
Ellis Rubin Howard.

[00:54:01.260 --> 00:54:02.040]
Palm Beach.

[00:54:02.500 --> 00:54:05.600]
Dwayne Stump says that door was here at 36D.

[00:54:07.180 --> 00:54:07.700]
Dave.

[00:54:08.440 --> 00:54:10.100]
I just want to be walked.

[00:54:10.320 --> 00:54:11.320]
He's up so long.

[00:54:14.120 --> 00:54:14.600]
Broward.

[00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:16.860]
Mommy, my hug is on her again.

[00:54:17.020 --> 00:54:18.080]
I got little cuckoo.

[00:54:18.900 --> 00:54:20.420]
This is quite a liking, right?

[00:54:20.600 --> 00:54:21.600]
My plane, I think.

[00:54:21.740 --> 00:54:22.300]
Quite a liking.

[00:54:22.380 --> 00:54:22.860]
Broward.

[00:54:23.080 --> 00:54:26.540]
Gary, I've fallen and I can't get out.

[00:54:28.020 --> 00:54:28.400]
Dave.

[00:54:28.960 --> 00:54:29.820]
Ben and Jerry live.

[00:54:31.840 --> 00:54:32.600]
Palm Beach.

[00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:34.940]
Dave.

[00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:36.980]
Yeah, they can.

[00:54:36.980 --> 00:54:37.660]
Little here.

[00:54:37.940 --> 00:54:38.400]
Boka.

[00:54:39.640 --> 00:54:40.100]
No.

[00:54:44.940 --> 00:54:46.160]
Dave County, hello.

[00:54:46.420 --> 00:54:47.140]
Oh, yeah, bro.

[00:54:49.220 --> 00:54:49.680]
Broward.

[00:54:49.900 --> 00:54:50.940]
Can I hold for the door?

[00:54:51.080 --> 00:54:51.960]
I'm Kent Allen, man.

[00:54:53.900 --> 00:54:56.260]
The norm, Kent Joel, ladies and gentlemen,

[00:54:56.260 --> 00:55:00.280]
setting new lows in the history of talk radio on WFT.

[00:55:00.420 --> 00:55:03.340]
Now you've got to have a good radio and be just in the right spot.

[00:55:03.420 --> 00:55:04.140]
Yeah, I can't.

[00:55:04.380 --> 00:55:05.180]
I can't do it.

[00:55:05.180 --> 00:55:08.300]
In fact, if you sit like right in the middle of the construction on 95,

[00:55:08.880 --> 00:55:11.200]
like in the median there, there's a spot, I think right there.

[00:55:11.360 --> 00:55:11.580]
Tower.

[00:55:12.080 --> 00:55:14.220]
On Oakland, you can get just in the right spot.

[00:55:14.220 --> 00:55:17.360]
There you can listen to it almost uninterrupted for four hours.

[00:55:17.480 --> 00:55:18.000]
Even at night.

[00:55:18.220 --> 00:55:20.180]
And the good thing is if you got a phone in the car,

[00:55:20.380 --> 00:55:21.540]
you can call me in the ear.

[00:55:21.580 --> 00:55:22.200]
You can get a call.

[00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:22.500]
Yeah.

[00:55:23.260 --> 00:55:24.320]
Oh, is he going to be here?

[00:55:24.320 --> 00:55:26.540]
He is going to be so sorry to you, Ben.

[00:55:26.620 --> 00:55:27.460]
You have no idea.

[00:55:28.180 --> 00:55:29.000]
Dave County, hello.

[00:55:29.260 --> 00:55:31.360]
I got a call from the first of when you're here.

[00:55:32.120 --> 00:55:33.080]
That was kind of cute.

[00:55:33.900 --> 00:55:34.220]
153.

[00:55:34.740 --> 00:55:38.180]
They're kind of tidying with what I said about FTL, didn't it?

[00:55:38.380 --> 00:55:38.540]
Didn't it?

[00:55:39.120 --> 00:55:39.520]
Yeah.

[00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:42.420]
Oh, I'm telling you, this is in the book is coming out on Wednesday.

[00:55:42.820 --> 00:55:43.900]
That'll be great, Sean.

[00:55:44.420 --> 00:55:47.100]
But nobody ever came in and told us what time the numbers are coming.

[00:55:47.240 --> 00:55:48.240]
It's Thursday, yeah.

[00:55:48.660 --> 00:55:48.820]
Right?

[00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:49.460]
Didn't it?

[00:55:49.540 --> 00:55:50.060]
Don't you see?

[00:55:50.180 --> 00:55:50.860]
Come out in the afternoon.

[00:55:50.920 --> 00:55:51.580]
I'm not always.

[00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:52.560]
I have no idea.

[00:55:52.820 --> 00:55:53.520]
I don't find out.

[00:55:54.280 --> 00:55:54.920]
Booker, hello.

[00:55:55.360 --> 00:55:56.180]
Yeah, Michael Jackson.

[00:55:56.740 --> 00:55:58.580]
And I can't beat it as well when I'm caught.

[00:55:59.300 --> 00:55:59.700]
BEEP.

[00:56:00.220 --> 00:56:00.800]
Palm Beach.

[00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:02.260]
The Metzuck.

[00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:03.760]
Good call.

[00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:05.700]
Dave County, hello.

[00:56:05.700 --> 00:56:08.500]
I'm moving around factors well when he's got him medication.

[00:56:09.480 --> 00:56:09.960]
BEEP.

[00:56:10.640 --> 00:56:11.120]
Proud.

[00:56:11.620 --> 00:56:13.300]
Into the far, I was thinking of that.

[00:56:13.880 --> 00:56:15.340]
Thank you very much.

[00:56:15.380 --> 00:56:15.980]
Into the far.

[00:56:15.980 --> 00:56:16.560]
Did you see it?

[00:56:16.860 --> 00:56:17.760]
No, not yet.

[00:56:18.120 --> 00:56:19.120]
It's bizarre.

[00:56:19.520 --> 00:56:20.580]
I heard you were strange.

[00:56:21.180 --> 00:56:21.780]
OK, thanks.

[00:56:21.980 --> 00:56:22.300]
You're up.

[00:56:22.460 --> 00:56:23.160]
Into the far.

[00:56:23.220 --> 00:56:23.500]
Yeah.

[00:56:23.880 --> 00:56:24.580]
Oh, man.

[00:56:24.880 --> 00:56:27.220]
Is that a strange move?

[00:56:27.620 --> 00:56:27.940]
Never heard.

[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:28.800]
Interesting move.

[00:56:29.400 --> 00:56:30.080]
You'd like it.

[00:56:30.160 --> 00:56:30.580]
A lot of sex.

[00:56:31.540 --> 00:56:32.500]
OK, proud.

[00:56:32.500 --> 00:56:32.960]
Hello.

[00:56:32.960 --> 00:56:35.220]
Hey, birdie, my boyfriend's back.

[00:56:37.340 --> 00:56:39.100]
I didn't even have to tune in.

[00:56:39.180 --> 00:56:40.740]
I heard you show two weeks ago.

[00:56:41.940 --> 00:56:42.540]

[00:56:44.240 --> 00:56:44.840]

[00:56:56.260 --> 00:56:56.760]
But deadly.

[00:56:57.420 --> 00:56:58.200]
Dave, hello.

[00:56:58.600 --> 00:57:00.060]
I'm dying over here.

[00:57:01.380 --> 00:57:01.980]
Broward.

[00:57:02.580 --> 00:57:05.580]
Seen paid a direct $1,000.

[00:57:05.580 --> 00:57:06.520]
Yes, folks.

[00:57:08.040 --> 00:57:08.320]
Dave.

[00:57:08.940 --> 00:57:10.640]
So unholy for a nary, is he?

[00:57:11.940 --> 00:57:12.420]
Broward.

[00:57:12.600 --> 00:57:13.060]
How's that?

[00:57:15.900 --> 00:57:16.380]
Boca.

[00:57:16.940 --> 00:57:18.180]
Where did they get all of Dave?

[00:57:21.200 --> 00:57:21.680]
Dave.

[00:57:22.220 --> 00:57:22.660]
One and all.

[00:57:25.400 --> 00:57:25.880]
Broward.

[00:57:26.120 --> 00:57:27.720]
Yes, we're on the other side.

[00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:29.440]
Look back, he's now in the days.

[00:57:31.040 --> 00:57:31.520]
Dave.

[00:57:31.520 --> 00:57:33.940]
Yes, this is bamboo, a bamboo boyfriend.

[00:57:34.080 --> 00:57:34.960]
If I can't get anybody.

[00:57:37.100 --> 00:57:38.300]
He's going to come to get you.

[00:57:38.380 --> 00:57:40.960]
I'm telling you, you got big problems in store.

[00:57:41.160 --> 00:57:42.320]
You're a big, big brother.

[00:57:42.860 --> 00:57:43.260]
Broward.

[00:57:43.420 --> 00:57:43.660]
Broward.

[00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:44.300]
Over.

[00:57:46.940 --> 00:57:48.400]
So Steve's done so, Godfather.

[00:57:48.520 --> 00:57:49.300]
Who's doing midday?

[00:57:49.640 --> 00:57:51.640]
In wild until they get there.

[00:57:51.940 --> 00:57:52.760]
You know, they're permanent.

[00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:53.740]
He's not the permanent.

[00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:55.440]
Until they get their stuff together.

[00:57:55.800 --> 00:57:56.580]
That's what I mean.

[00:57:56.580 --> 00:57:56.760]
In wild, what?

[00:57:57.180 --> 00:57:57.760]
In wild until they get there.

[00:57:58.120 --> 00:57:58.240]
Yes.

[00:57:59.120 --> 00:58:00.060]
Have you heard their music?

[00:58:00.840 --> 00:58:01.840]
Dave, hello.

[00:58:02.960 --> 00:58:03.820]
Line round.

[00:58:04.440 --> 00:58:04.840]
Yeah.

It's your was.

[00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:07.420]

Hello.

[00:58:08.640 --> 00:58:09.000]
Good afternoon.

[00:58:09.640 --> 00:58:10.160]
Hello.

[00:58:11.320 --> 00:58:15.080]
These people are sharp as a bat of lots of good.

[00:58:15.260 --> 00:58:16.080]
They're great to be back.

[00:58:16.260 --> 00:58:16.840]
Dave Chowdy.

[00:58:17.500 --> 00:58:17.820]
Hello.

[00:58:20.420 --> 00:58:23.140]
Okay, well, another one of those little pauses that we've

[00:58:23.140 --> 00:58:24.500]
come to know on this show.

[00:58:26.940 --> 00:58:28.660]
I hate to break the news to you, pal.

[00:58:28.660 --> 00:58:30.640]
But some of those I understand, okay?

[00:58:30.880 --> 00:58:31.040]
Oh.

[00:58:31.040 --> 00:58:31.580]
Real well.

[00:58:31.880 --> 00:58:32.640]
Just like you do.

[00:58:33.660 --> 00:58:35.580]
What do we, how about Boca?

[00:58:36.160 --> 00:58:37.920]
He said slowly.

[00:58:38.420 --> 00:58:40.380]
How about Boca?

[00:58:41.480 --> 00:58:41.680]
Well.

[00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:43.520]
Yeah.

[00:58:43.900 --> 00:58:45.140]
We were safe on that one.

[00:58:46.120 --> 00:58:48.280]
No problems at all in Palm Beach.

[00:58:48.560 --> 00:58:49.840]
Do my talk about slow.

[00:58:50.060 --> 00:58:50.660]
Do my favorite.

[00:58:50.720 --> 00:58:51.380]
Dave Chowdy.

[00:58:51.700 --> 00:58:53.000]
The New York Street.

[00:58:55.700 --> 00:58:56.260]
Broward.

[00:58:56.720 --> 00:58:59.000]
Get back to the...

[00:58:59.900 --> 00:59:00.920]
Bomb Beach.

[00:59:01.180 --> 00:59:04.880]
Talk with Cistery Baysell with Norm Kent on STL.

[00:59:05.460 --> 00:59:06.120]
Got it.

[00:59:06.260 --> 00:59:07.680]
I think that's what he's going to be doing.

[00:59:07.940 --> 00:59:08.500]
Nate Chowdy.

[00:59:08.600 --> 00:59:08.780]
Hello.

[00:59:09.060 --> 00:59:10.140]
Very good to say.

[00:59:11.960 --> 00:59:12.520]
Broward.

[00:59:13.100 --> 00:59:15.960]
Yes, he's being for Boca's radio.

[00:59:18.100 --> 00:59:18.660]
Broward.

[00:59:19.120 --> 00:59:20.240]
I love you, Ocean Man.

[00:59:22.240 --> 00:59:23.000]
Boca.

[00:59:23.940 --> 00:59:24.860]
Survey's bad.

[00:59:26.620 --> 00:59:27.240]
Dave.

[00:59:30.220 --> 00:59:30.220]

[00:59:33.960 --> 00:59:37.160]
I just like sometimes to see how it all goes.

[00:59:37.220 --> 00:59:38.040]
A little with it.

[00:59:38.460 --> 00:59:39.080]
Nate Chowdy.

[00:59:39.180 --> 00:59:39.380]

How are you?

[00:59:46.900 --> 00:59:47.260]
How are you?

[00:59:47.640 --> 00:59:48.240]
I'm good.

[00:59:48.440 --> 00:59:49.380]

[00:59:49.380 --> 00:59:50.800]
Steve Sands, we miss you.

[00:59:50.940 --> 00:59:51.520]
Get rid of him.

[00:59:51.920 --> 00:59:52.560]
Broward.

[00:59:52.660 --> 00:59:53.300]
Dave.

[00:59:53.760 --> 00:59:55.360]
I'm coming, beanie boy.

[00:59:58.040 --> 00:59:58.680]

[00:59:59.820 --> 01:00:00.460]
Broward.

[01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:09.100]
I got some shine on a cloudy day.

[01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:13.280]
You know what, Steve?

[01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:13.840]
Michael's Jr.

[01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:14.400]
Wasn't it?

[01:00:14.940 --> 01:00:15.600]
Dave Chowdy.

[01:00:15.700 --> 01:00:15.900]
Hello.

[01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:18.000]
Who pulled from Kiwri?

[01:00:18.420 --> 01:00:18.420]

[01:00:18.420 --> 01:00:18.420]

[01:00:18.420 --> 01:00:18.420]

[01:00:18.420 --> 01:00:18.420]

Yeah, take your hat from another field.

[01:00:26.460 --> 01:00:27.120]
Dave.

[01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:28.020]
Dave.

[01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:38.360]

[01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:39.840]
I'm playing against parties over.

[01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:42.960]
I don't know that could be.

[01:00:43.180 --> 01:00:43.600]
You know.

[01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:45.700]
And last but not least in Boca.

[01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:48.740]
Oh, I'm thinking.

[01:00:50.660 --> 01:00:52.160]
Great last but not least.

[01:00:52.180 --> 01:00:53.220]
Okay, that's going to do it.

[01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:54.360]
It's wonderful being back.

[01:00:54.420 --> 01:00:57.220]
And if you believe that, you know, you'll buy almost anything.

[01:00:57.740 --> 01:00:58.760]
Stay tuned now.

[01:00:58.980 --> 01:01:01.000]
Steve has got another one of these contrived debates.

[01:01:01.500 --> 01:01:05.160]
And the question is, how long will Roy Masters let Bob Puts

[01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:06.840]
leave his hand on his knee?

[01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:10.600]
That's going to be well worth listening in for.

[01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:13.940]
Don't forget the sunny on sports talk, Yankee and White Sox today to clock.

[01:01:13.940 --> 01:01:15.480]
And we'll see you again.

[01:01:15.740 --> 01:01:18.740]
I know it's, it's frightening for me to think about it.

[01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:21.880]
We'll see you again tomorrow morning at 10 here on 610-WYOD.
