[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.020]
All the old ladies are getting excited now.

[00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:05.700]
Where is it?

[00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:06.900]
Bring a build caller.

[00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:09.500]
Oh my God!

[00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:12.720]
It's the real build caller!

[00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.620]
Come on, don't hover in the background!

[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.900]
Come on!

[00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.160]
Come on now!

[00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.620]
Playing hard to get.

[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.120]
Open that gate up for build caller now.

[00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:26.620]
Let that man through.

[00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:28.620]
This mic is sitting at a tough life.

[00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:30.540]
He's never cashed a ticket in his life.

[00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:31.320]
Put him here.

[00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:32.820]
Yeah, but the chair point right here.

[00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.020]
You're busy eating anyway.

[00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.300]
Right here next to me.

[00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.880]
No, I'm going to sit in the middle and referee.

[00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.540]
This could be.

[00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.000]
You want me to sit right here by a rough part of the show now.

[00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.120]
What are you pointing your finger at?

[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.400]
Right here.

[00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.820]
Over here.

[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.280]
No, don't give him.

[00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:47.400]
You just sit down over here.

[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.900]
I'll sit in the middle and kind of referee.

[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.160]
No, no, I want him by me.

[00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.900]
No, you don't.

[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:52.700]
Yes, I do.

[00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:54.340]
No, you have an advantage.

[00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:55.400]
He can't hear you over there.

[00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.020]
It's called her.

[00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.360]
What a pleasant surprise to see you.

[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.440]
Star of WQAM in the morning from 5'30 to 10.

[00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:07.000]
We don't want to sit.

[00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.060]
We're going to get all upset.

[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.200]
But he's got plenty of audience to share.

[00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:11.720]
That's what he said to me.

[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:12.700]
I'm sorry I didn't hear what you said.

[00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:18.140]
I said lester is really a great guy, isn't he?

[00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:19.180]
Oh, this is great.

[00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.120]
Can you hear it?

[00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.320]
These are better than ours.

[00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.880]
Hello, test.

[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:23.340]
How you doing?

[00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:24.880]
You look fat.

[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.100]
You've lost a little weight.

[00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.180]
Did you know that's nutrition?

[00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.920]
By the way, do we want to talk about that great meal we had over the weekend?

[00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:33.540]
Don't do it.

[00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:34.220]
Don't do it.

[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.780]
I won't do it.

[00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:35.780]
No, we know it actually.

[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:36.440]
It was standby.

[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:37.540]
It was stands bra.

[00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.460]
I'm not going to tell the story, but it was stands berthay.

[00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.520]
We all went out and had a great meal.

[00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.900]
Don't try it.

[00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.280]
Please.

[00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.760]
I'm going to destroy my mind.

[00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.880]
First day, we had a tremendous meal.

[00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.440]
I mentioned it several times.

[00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.840]
Did you?

[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.720]
Yes, you tell me.

[00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.340]
No, I did not tell all the things.

[00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:50.180]
No, I didn't know.

[00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.960]
Great.

[00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.560]

[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.500]
Marvin is more his Marvin.

[00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.660]
He's got a great crowd meal.

[00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.940]
I'm proud of you because I know you were up in the hospital.

[00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.520]
Marvin, you're still looking for him in Chicago.

[00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.560]
I don't know.

[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.620]
He was here a minute ago, but then he heard you were coming in.

[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.260]
Is this Johnny Dark?

[00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:06.960]
You never met Johnny Dark?

[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.000]
No, I was.

[00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.820]
Don Cox was here.

[00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:10.580]
I know a lot of people who I'm sorry.

[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.520]
I say Don Cox was here before.

[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.100]
And this is the rat.

[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.060]
And this is the bird over here.

[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.580]
The rat.

[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.360]
I've never met him.

[00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:19.200]
That's correct.

[00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.940]
You never met the bird?

[00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.240]
No.

[00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:21.720]
And you don't know me.

[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.020]
You don't know me?

[00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.360]
I don't want to get into it on here.

[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:26.080]
Yes.

[00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.360]
What do you think you're here for?

[00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.300]
I'm here to buy some CDs.

[00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:32.640]
Oh, I'm sure.

[00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.860]
No, you're here to confront me face to face and tell me the charges.

[00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:37.960]
He's here to get some more rice.

[00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.320]
He's here to get some more rice.

[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.740]
Stevens records.

[00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:39.960]
Okay, now don't get hostile.

[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.260]
I want to hear what I've done to you, Mr. Calder.

[00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:44.780]
Okay, we're going to take a little break now.

[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:47.420]
Oh, boo.

[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.800]
And when we come back, Bill Calder will answer the question.

[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.080]
Is the rat sink, does it sink or does it float?

[00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.920]
That's the question.

[00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:59.180]
Uh-huh.

[00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:01.940]
Remember the sink and float, lady?

[00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:03.700]
Well, look at that.

[00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:04.880]
His mic is off, too, now.

[00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:06.400]
Now, we didn't tell you this.

[00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:07.040]
Is this off?

[00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:08.080]
Oh, there he is.

[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.700]
This is advantage.

[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.260]
We will have Calder's mic on.

[00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:11.080]
Yours will be off.

[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.340]
But he's only been back in town a short time.

[00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:15.380]
He needs a little edge.

[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.020]
Anyway, would you like me to sign one of those things?

[00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.600]
No thanks.

[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:19.800]
Okay, tell me.

[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.100]
Hey, can I do the spot?

[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:23.640]
Certainly.

[00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.940]
The surly bird gets the worm, right?

[00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.560]
I tell you about Toyota Hollywood.

[00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.640]
Would you like to read some of these prices here?

[00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:30.300]
Shoppers.

[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:31.360]
I'm not doing it.

[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.620]
If you want to read the prices, anyway, a brand new 89

[00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.780]
Celica that was 50,000 56 sticker price.

[00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.680]
You can get it for 8328 right now at Toyota Hollywood.

[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:42.580]
That's like half price.

[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:43.880]
That would give you a half dozen.

[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.820]
Even Bill Tesser could figure that out.

[00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.580]
An 89 Corolla that stickers for $11,493.

[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:50.820]
$6,293.

[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:52.940]
A brand new 89 to sell.

[00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.040]
A sticker price, $10,673.

[00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.160]
Almost exactly 50% off.

[00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.160]
You can buy it right now with discount and credit.

[00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.600]
What a 5,373 bucks.

[00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.420]
Seriously, there are just a few days left till the 90s are going to come in.

[00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:06.960]
They are just brooming out the remaining 89.

[00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.260]
So get yourself over for the deal of a lifetime to Toyota of Hollywood.

[00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.200]
On $441 between tapped and Sheridan streets in Hollywood.

[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.840]
And we'll be back with a battle of the bands from SPACs after this.

[00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.700]
Chuck Meyer here.

[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.220]
How do you spend your...

[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.340]
Oh, I got a mouthful of food.

[00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.220]
And the callers here, he and the bird are going to have it out in public now.

[00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:32.780]
It's going to be great with a live audience.

[00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.420]
Finally.

[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:35.000]
Finally.

[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.980]
I'm going to come up with a mix of rounds, three falls.

[00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:39.220]
If they turn my mic on.

[00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.740]
Oh, there it is.

[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.480]
It's on.

[00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:41.500]
Quit your belly.

[00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:41.960]
Can you, can you?

[00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.360]
Go ahead, rip into hell.

[00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:45.520]
No, I have nothing to say.

[00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.860]
I've said everything I have to say.

[00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.080]
There's a fan of yours.

[00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.480]
What is it?

[00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:49.940]

[00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.420]
He just plays a big fan here.

[00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.840]
Listen.

[00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.780]
When you came in, man, you get surly with me.

[00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.000]
I'm a shopper here.

[00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:00.260]
I'm not here to see you.

[00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.160]
You know, ladies went nuts when you came in here.

[00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:02.840]
Man, it was incredible.

[00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:04.500]
What is this?

[00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:05.340]
Oh, look at that.

[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.120]
You want some shells?

[00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:06.860]
No, thanks.

[00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.820]
You're not going to eat?

[00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:09.720]
No, I didn't come here to eat.

[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:10.980]
Look at that beautiful fruit.

[00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:12.300]
You know why I came here?

[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:13.160]
I'll be honest with you.

[00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:14.180]
I came here to say hello.

[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.800]
You are so full of crap that it's just frightening, you know?

[00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:21.080]
It's frightening.

[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.260]
No, I did.

[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.120]
Well, he would like to say hello.

[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.220]
He'd like to mend his fence.

[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:26.140]
What is it like to know less than any question?

[00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:27.560]
Okay, I want to know more.

[00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.180]
Oh, I know you're dying to get this over with.

[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:30.040]
Yes, I am.

[00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:30.360]
I know.

[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:30.760]
I know.

[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.700]
Because I have no complaint with you, Mr. Calder.

[00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:35.160]
I like you.

[00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:35.520]
I shouldn't have.

[00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:36.520]
I know.

[00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:40.320]
Bill, I listened to you back on the great entertainer.

[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:40.560]
I enjoyed it.

[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.680]
Well, look back into his fence like saying you remember when I was in the cupboard wagon,

[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:45.480]
Bill.

[00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:48.320]
I've always enjoyed your show on the air, Bill.

[00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.340]
I've never ripped you on or on the air.

[00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:51.740]

[00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:53.500]
I never hate your guts.

[00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:54.900]
Why do you hate me?

[00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:57.000]
I'm going to be honest.

[00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:58.900]
I'm going to tell you what an old one.

[00:05:59.040 --> 00:05:59.500]
I like this.

[00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:01.120]
From the very...

[00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:01.680]
You know what?

[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:03.280]
When his nostrils start flaring like that?

[00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:04.780]
No, I'm going to be honest with him.

[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.340]
I'm going to be honest with him because I think he deserves an answer.

[00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:18.720]
For the very beginning, when Neil said he was going to have a sidekick, yes, I told him,

[00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.220]
I thought it was a great idea.

[00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:25.760]
But for God's sakes, don't get a Gentile.

[00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:32.820]
I did.

[00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:34.640]
I said, get a Jewish guy.

[00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:35.460]
Excellent point.

[00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.480]
So this is my big crime.

[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:39.280]
Your Gentile.

[00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:39.840]
Society.

[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:46.560]
No, I didn't take exception to a few things you said because I'm not the type to take cheap shots at people.

[00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:49.700]
I have never ripped you.

[00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.120]
Any comment I've made about you?

[00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:51.760]
No, I'll tell you that.

[00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:55.200]
We're running out of time and we're getting close to the news.

[00:06:55.440 --> 00:07:03.880]
Let me just say, in closing, that a couple of times I felt you jumped in and you were much too quick to rip.

[00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:06.260]
Don't use that rip.

[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:07.700]
Well, not rip.

[00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:11.000]
No, but to suddenly take a shot at me.

[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:11.480]
To do what?

[00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:13.060]
To suddenly take a shot.

[00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:19.340]
Number one, Neil was giving me hell about some callers as he's privy to do that because...

[00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:20.560]
You don't point my call to your show this morning?

[00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:21.840]
See, I'm not what I meant.

[00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:29.680]
And then you jumped right in and said, yeah, an Lester called to me like this like Bill, I did say it.

[00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:30.180]
That's right.

[00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:32.240]
I did not intend it as a second negative.

[00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:35.940]
Secondly, when he couldn't find my ratings, which are hard to find, I agree.

[00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:42.480]
You said, well, I'm not going to say anything because you'll think I'm attacking him or something to that effect.

[00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:48.900]
After all, I'm not going to say anything, but I know why you can't find his ratings because he doesn't have any.

[00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:50.580]
You are too sensitive.

[00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:52.500]
You are ridiculous.

[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:54.740]
Glenn, let me ask you a question.

[00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:56.720]
Glenn, listen to me.

[00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:00.880]
Listen to yourself right now and then tell me I'm sensitive.

[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:01.760]
I'm laughing.

[00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:03.240]
I'm having a great time.

[00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:08.220]
I'm sensitive to you worse than me, which I never thought I would encounter in my entire life here.

[00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:10.060]
I'm here to have a good time.

[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:11.060]
I'm Bill...

[00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:12.220]
Bill...

[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:17.660]
Bill Cussford and I are here to provide some CDs, to buy some soundtracks.

[00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:18.920]
I can't hear you.

[00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:19.780]
No, sir...

[00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:21.940]
I heard the big charts.

[00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:23.580]
I know what my crime is now.

[00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:24.640]
I'm a Goisha Cup.

[00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:25.720]
You've got me.

[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.140]
You've got me...

[00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:28.340]
Well, I'm back through the wall.

[00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:30.200]
No, but you have that Gentile humor.

[00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:31.040]
It's not...

[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:33.500]
You heard it.

[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:34.580]
It's you heard it.

[00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:35.020]
It's right.

[00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:36.820]
It's not ripping me to you.

[00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:38.340]
But it's a Gentile humor.

[00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:40.520]
See, Jews can attack me.

[00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:42.120]
And I see.

[00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:44.060]
Now this answer is my other question.

[00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:46.660]
He's beaten on me for about 14 years.

[00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:48.680]
It's true.

[00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:49.900]
And it was all true, that's right.

[00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:50.460]
Exactly.

[00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:53.540]
I remember the first time when he came to me for a job.

[00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:54.660]
It's true.

[00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:55.400]
I asked him.

[00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:58.400]
The first thing I asked him was not worried worked or do you have a tape or anything?

[00:08:58.400 --> 00:08:59.500]
I said, are you Jewish?

[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:00.120]
Bill.

[00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:01.380]
Let me tell you something.

[00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:02.120]
It's all serious.

[00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:02.800]
I'm in the West Bill.

[00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:04.620]
My girlfriend is Jewish.

[00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:06.220]
People...

[00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:08.260]
My landlords are Jewish.

[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.700]
I work with someone who's Jewish.

[00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:12.460]
I'm an honorary Jew.

[00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:19.920]
And he lives in Kendall.

[00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:21.660]
Yes.

[00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:24.080]
Yeah, for your question.

[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:25.560]
I'm going to tell you something.

[00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:26.980]
I'm going to tell you something.

[00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:29.660]
I have a lot of friends who are Jewish.

[00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:32.180]
I know Neil Rogers and he's Jewish.

[00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:33.800]
And I'm going to tell you something.

[00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:35.580]
Your no Jewish.

[00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:44.000]
He's got my vote.

[00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:49.420]
Now I'm going to leave.

[00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:50.640]
Have we settled this?

[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:51.920]
Have we?

[00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:52.780]
I think so.

[00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:53.500]
I think so.

[00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:54.400]
I think he puts you to rest.

[00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:54.920]
Did you hear?

[00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:58.120]
So how could I come back from that?

[00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:01.000]
The last thing I did today was I had a little...

[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.320]
We have a little breast pot in the studio.

[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:04.920]
A pot, yes.

[00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:06.520]
Did you grease it up a little bit?

[00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:06.920]
I grease it up.

[00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:09.280]
And through an arat.

[00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:10.320]
No, I'm only kidding.

[00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:12.100]
But you have to remember Glenn.

[00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:14.060]
What was that mystery sound by the way?

[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:16.640]
Glenn, you've taken a lot of kidding since you've been on the show.

[00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:18.040]
Because you don't do anything like that.

[00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:18.560]
You know what I mean?

[00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:21.740]
And you have to learn to take a joke.

[00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:22.600]
This is all a joke.

[00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:24.060]
I've never even known you.

[00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:25.240]
That's what I thought.

[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:29.260]
So how come I don't even like you and I don't even know you?

[00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:33.140]
Grito.

[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:35.880]
It's all in the spirit.

[00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:37.440]
You should have learned this from Neil.

[00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:38.380]
Exactly.

[00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:40.700]
Neil has learned nothing.

[00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:43.560]
There's...

[00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:43.860]
Okay.

[00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:44.700]
Okay.

[00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:47.020]
Are we friends again?

[00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:47.560]
Are we?

[00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:48.040]
No.

[00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:48.720]
No.

[00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:49.700]
Oh.

[00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:53.540]
Okay.

[00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:55.060]
Well, I think we have cleared that up.

[00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:56.400]
We're real clear for you.

[00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:58.320]
And we're almost at the end of the hour.

[00:10:58.320 --> 00:10:59.620]
Now, when is the food coming?

[00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:03.180]
I've got to go get some CDs.

[00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:04.080]
It's been great.

[00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:04.400]
You see it?

[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:04.680]
You see it?

[00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:05.960]
Get some raised Stevens, man.

[00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:06.880]
You're not playing it up here.

[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:07.260]
You see it?

[00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:09.920]
And we got some.

[00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:11.060]
Don't you want to eat anything?

[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:11.720]
Come on.

[00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:12.480]
I don't act like that.

[00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:13.420]
You're so...

[00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:13.960]
Come on.

[00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:14.860]
Be fat like me.

[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:15.640]
Be fat like me.

[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:16.000]

[00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:21.040]
Okay.

[00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:21.480]
Okay.

[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.220]
Have a wonderful life and I'll see you at the track.

[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:26.780]
Anyway, we've got some stuffed shells.

[00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:28.560]
I think I may just have a little touch of that.

[00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:29.960]
Pastrami, little pizza.

[00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:30.860]
Some of the ravioli.

[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:31.920]
Everything is delicious.

[00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:37.780]
And we want to thank everybody who brought the food by Steve

[00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:38.840]
from Steve's Pizza.

[00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:39.440]
Right?

[00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:40.340]
TV's pizza.

[00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:41.620]
Now, you all straighten out with him.

[00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:42.540]
Is that all clear to him?

[00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:43.800]
I'm going to talk to him during the break.

[00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:45.500]
And then we'll find out.

[00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:45.980]
I'll go get some food.

[00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:47.080]
I'll report back to you.

[00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:49.240]
Oh, he says he wants to talk to you during the break.

[00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:50.060]
Off the air.

[00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:50.880]
Off the air.

[00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:51.040]
Yeah.

[00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:52.040]
I'll report back.

[00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:55.600]
Okay, Chuck Meyer is standing by and he's got the new NYOD news.

[00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:56.660]
We'll come back in 12-5.

[00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:58.420]
Does anybody know what Steve is doing today?

[00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:00.080]
Does anybody care?

[00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:02.500]
Does anybody care?

[00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:02.600]

[00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:04.120]
And they all said thumbs down.

[00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:05.240]
Abortion.

[00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:08.400]
Okay, they said Steve would be doing another abortion today, too.

[00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:12.720]
And we'll come back live from the brand new specs in North Miami in 12-05.

[00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:14.140]
Yeah.

[00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:16.140]
You have a good way to do it.

[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:19.060]
And, uh, I can't believe you can do it.

[00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:21.460]
So, you've got to put you in your cage real good.

[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:22.160]
Oh, did he?

[00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:25.240]
Kind of stirred that pot when he was here a little bit, didn't he?

[00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:26.280]
Exactly.

[00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:27.860]
Okay, I'll see it to recent.

[00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:28.880]
It's great to see you.

[00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:30.780]
Unbelievable.

[00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:34.120]
We remember the story some of us.

[00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:35.580]
Okay, anyway, what are we doing?

[00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:37.320]
Are we doing all- I will.

[00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:39.900]
I promise I swear to a Madeline O'Hare.

[00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:41.320]
Okay, my hand on the...

[00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:44.800]
Okay, now listen, Dion is going to be here any second of it.

[00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:46.440]
He can get through this wild crowd.

[00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:48.220]
He's going to be here at noon.

[00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:50.420]
Okay, take care of yourself.

[00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:52.340]
I guess he's going to bring his guitar, right?

[00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:54.660]
He's going to possibly bring his guitar or not.

[00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:55.540]
Or not, he's a case maybe.

[00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:57.760]
And it's going to be great.

[00:12:57.860 --> 00:12:59.740]
And I got a little of my gas here in the water.

[00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:02.560]
And everything is under control.

[00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:03.840]
This has been just more...

[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:06.140]
See, when you come out, it really brings out the...

[00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:08.000]
See, brings out the words.

[00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:11.300]
Yeah, it brings out my...

[00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:13.720]
I'm going to have just a little...

[00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:15.460]
I don't want to go overboard.

[00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:19.180]
But the people from post-abilities we want to thank for bringing all of it.

[00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:20.680]
Yeah, they all bond really good.

[00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:23.120]
If I didn't taste the shells, they would be crushed.

[00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:24.100]
Wouldn't they?

[00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:24.440]
Yeah.

[00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:26.440]
Devils, why do you get a little plate?

[00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:27.880]
Well, I don't want a whole thing.

[00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:29.800]
Okay, let's give the numbers out.

[00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:34.400]
Just in case there are people who still want to call and in case we can hear any of the callers, which is unlikely.

[00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:36.400]
We have a full board of calls.

[00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:40.460]
See, we don't have to beg for calls when we do this either because for some reason when they're in...

[00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:41.780]
We're in the studio, they hate us.

[00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:45.740]
But when we're out and about, they just go nuts.

[00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:49.260]
And of course, Rogers on the board of days, so we know that we'll actually...

[00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:49.260]

[00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:51.460]
...get one or two legitimate calls before the end of the show.

[00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:54.560]
And that's all I'm having just a little taste of.

[00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:56.420]
There's anybody who wants this...

[00:13:56.420 --> 00:13:57.380]
What are we going to do with this?

[00:13:57.700 --> 00:13:59.460]
Well, you should take it back there to...

[00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:02.940]
John, aren't they eating back there?

[00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:03.260]
Yeah.

[00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:05.900]
Or over here, they got a table.

[00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:08.240]
Oh, yeah, go ahead.

[00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:10.640]
No, but just don't... what's up the floor? That's all I...

[00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:11.680]
Oh, don't drop the cheese.

[00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:15.340]
Oh, God, they got this beautiful new place here.

[00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:18.000]
And these people are going to pick out and put stuff to join.

[00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:20.240]
And they'll never...

[00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:23.180]
Oh, cheese!

[00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:26.360]
What are you, sir?

[00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:27.220]
You okay?

[00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:30.040]
Yeah, with his fingers he's eating stuffed shells.

[00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:31.440]
Oh, go ahead, please.

[00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:32.860]
You can't do too much damage with that.

[00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:33.920]
We got Jerry Vale here.

[00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:35.060]
He's going to sing a medley of his hit.

[00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:36.980]
Does he look like Jerry Vale?

[00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:37.340]
Yeah.

[00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:38.000]
Huh?

[00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:38.620]
Yes.

[00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:41.140]
Of course these people don't even know Jerry Vale.

[00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:43.060]
Look, you know Jerry Vale?

[00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:44.780]
Does he look just like him?

[00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:45.440]
Yeah.

[00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:47.100]
Yeah.

[00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:48.680]
Okay.

[00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:49.880]
Who's this for?

[00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:52.380]
Who want... oh, for you, you don't look like you need it, sir.

[00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:54.700]
Yeah, right.

[00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:57.260]
You haven't done enough sharing from what it looks like.

[00:14:57.880 --> 00:14:59.540]
Okay, it's 12 away to W.I.O.D.

[00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:01.960]
Let's punch up a call and see if there's any chance

[00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:03.040]
that we can hear them.

[00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:03.360]
Okay.

[00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:07.300]
First, first look at this guy on this man's...

[00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:09.420]
Oh, jeez!

[00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:12.500]
Dr. Vinny B.

[00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:16.560]
It says on this man's body, Dr. Vinny B.

[00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:17.600]
Get a seat.

[00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:19.180]
Oh, go.

[00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:20.260]

[00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:21.480]
I don't believe it.

[00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:23.620]
Oh, look at this.

[00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:26.440]
We love the pictures.

[00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:30.480]
Yeah, there's a few stiffs lying in a street waiting for you

[00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:31.180]
on a way across.

[00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:32.800]
Oh, I bet.

[00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:36.600]
Okay, and have a couple of that little sandwich before your surgery.

[00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:37.720]
It'll help your eyesight.

[00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:39.840]
It'll get your blood sugar back up.

[00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:41.340]
Dr. Vinny B.

[00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:42.500]
Isn't he a piece of art?

[00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:42.820]
What a day.

[00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:44.340]
Man, the celebrity.

[00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:46.400]
How'd you like to be sitting in his waiting room, huh?

[00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:47.480]
Boy, he is.

[00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:48.800]
The celebrity's here today.

[00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:49.780]
It's just...

[00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:51.240]
I can't control the...

[00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:53.920]
I wouldn't be surprised if Don Agony showed up, you know?

[00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:54.340]
Noodles.

[00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:55.620]
It happened.

[00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:57.100]
We're still waiting for Irene, right?

[00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:58.140]
Yeah, waiting for Irene.

[00:15:58.160 --> 00:15:58.740]
Waiting for Irene.

[00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:01.500]
Anybody from Love 94 has been there.

[00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:02.820]
And Keith Allen might show up.

[00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:04.800]
He's there to be a good challenger,

[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.940]
wouldn't it since they've been calling in a ledging

[00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:08.340]
that they want to make up to?

[00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:10.560]
We're very close to where he lives.

[00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:13.740]
I bet you this crowd would go nuts if Keith Allen came in and kissed him

[00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:15.120]
made up with you right in the middle of the bag.

[00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:17.660]
Now, Bill called or face me face to face,

[00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:20.460]
and we had it out on the air, and I found out my crime.

[00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:22.860]
And I wouldn't be surprised if Joey stops by, too,

[00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:25.060]
to plug that sick TV show in his...

[00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:28.940]
I have no argument with Joey, though.

[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.320]
Speaking of kissing and making him...

[00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:31.600]
Was this Meg on again today?

[00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:33.100]
Boy.

[00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:35.980]
Like I said, I wouldn't give it like, yeah, what a show.

[00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:36.520]
That's right.

[00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:38.060]
We got to talk about...

[00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:40.340]
No, we don't have to talk about anything in this break.

[00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:44.340]
We just have to do a little break, and we'll come back where it's

[00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:46.420]
specs the brand new one on Biscayne Boulevard

[00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:48.960]
between 124th and 125th right,

[00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:53.800]
next to Wendy's, and just have a block away from that Kenny's Deli,

[00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:55.400]
where they sent him to delicious pastrami,

[00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:56.820]
what are you laughing about?

[00:16:57.020 --> 00:16:57.940]
Go ahead, Shadelli.

[00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:00.880]
Bill called or...

[00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:03.940]
No, he wouldn't know pastrami for all of us, Skye, okay?

[00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:05.520]
We'll come right back from specs.
