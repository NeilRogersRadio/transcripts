were better than this look at that the brow lines are just kind of like sitting there

[00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:15.440]
and a vocal line they're just not enthusiastic anymore okay they just don't love us like they used to

[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:19.440]
do they i don't think they hate us like poison to be honest with you they

[00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:24.260]
11 33 at wild one thing you're going to love are those great oh Tim was starting up again

[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:30.000]
11 37 at wild couldn't been anybody else because the other engineers don't hate me some of the

[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.520]
mildly dislike but it's only Tim anyway we have an open line and that's a little inside here

[00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:38.920]
Sharon was telling us a little story about some stuff in the hallway yeah the only engineer who

[00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:43.660]
won't speak to me who's that Tim oh he doesn't speak to you eat it while see your part of the show

[00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:50.060]
exactly he is carrying on his guy again at rickhead words uh juvenile behavior anyway not

[00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:53.880]
seriously you know i don't really care but when you work i've said this before when you work in

[00:11:53.880 --> 00:12:02.880]
a building with people every day it just just the most simple the most superficial common sense is

[00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:08.280]
that even if you what what it would nick is saying no are there people you don't speak to there are

[00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:15.080]
why because you hate their guts right yes he didn't want he didn't want to say it emphatically

[00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:19.720]
but he kind of like yeah i don't understand it i mean i first of all there aren't that many people

[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:28.400]
in the building i dislike i'm trying to think there's only two and one recently yeah we don't

[00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:32.640]
want to mention Bill wise his name i'm trying to think if there's anybody else there nobody else in

[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:40.940]
building just like yeah do you now very you know just wonder and but even even at that well

[00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:45.080]
no i will not speak to Bill wise but that that's more than dislike that's that that's just

[00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:49.920]
common sense when he treats you like garbage and stiffs somebody else because of a problem he's

[00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:55.020]
got with us but the engineering thing boy is just incredible i mean you just it just doesn't it

[00:12:55.020 --> 00:13:00.860]
isn't done you know i mean just put on an act just be for yeah i'm not one of these people believes

[00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:05.840]
in putting on an act in your life okay but where you work every day and you have to encounter the

[00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:12.400]
same people every day it's just like i said the simplest most basic common decency but of course

[00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:17.500]
some people don't have that no so he was out there in a hallway a hawk in a china with scott trying

[00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:22.560]
to start trouble again like i'm starting the story again the story didn't have to do with scott his

[00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:26.660]
name was mentioned only because he was involved in it because Bill wise mentioned it at the table

[00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:31.580]
but boy i i think i like crayons or something out here they think it worked for key thighs

[00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:37.400]
we're going to try it here now because since i've come back today's only wednesday i i have never seen

[00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:42.400]
such juvenile behavior in all my life it's like they're all regressing into into an infantile state

[00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:49.460]
like indiana it's eleven thirty nine at w i d we got a mobile phone in store let's get to the

[00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:55.160]
important stuff and screw all these childish idiots hello hey nil yeah hey i'm just wondering in

[00:13:55.160 --> 00:14:00.840]
in honor of the maylocks and w o l d i got a bunch of people that i got one to hear that um

[00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:04.620]
wasted away again in allen bail do you well that he mean like a bunch like two

[00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:11.460]
no i mean like uh two maybe maybe even two bunches maybe a couple of bunches i'll be damned uh

[00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:15.640]
so this is really a request is that what you say no no i wouldn't i wouldn't put a request i

[00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:21.060]
suggestion what's that a suggestion a suggestion mm-hmm while you sound like you're a howl to

[00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:24.960]
that twenty one twenty one so you're under the age of a hundred you're in stew you're in

[00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:30.660]
steward yeah what are you doing there work in driving working in computer's the pain in the ass

[00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:34.900]
so you live there no i live down in four lot of all you live in four lot of that because i was

[00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:38.140]
going to say if you said you live in steward i would immediately pull a card out of the machine

[00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:42.800]
but since you live down here with us and suffer through the daily rigors of life in sunflower

[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:47.840]
there's no problem at all well thank you sir okay anybody in particular we're going to dedicate

[00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:51.540]

[00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:25.560]
you again it's eleven fifty three at wio d i will say this and of course part of the reason is

[00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:32.720]
because we had that accident in chicago but here we were surrounded by martial field lord and

[00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:38.300]

[00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:03.180]

[00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:09.020]
about pussy in the well and uh the cheese cake but what are you talking about cheese cake yeah i don't

[00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:45.720]

[00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:28.420]
nothing ever you're right go away pal okay you're another one of those Palm Beach people who

[00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:32.280]
thinks that there's really stuff going on up there and that god for sake in place this place is

[00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:37.980]
bad enough okay this is a bush league the it's a tropical depression is what it is down here but

[00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:43.780]
Palm Beach is like it's not even like little league it's like sand law okay it's like the littlest

[00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:50.320]
of the little leagues as Alice would say the tiniest uh huh the smallest of the small so just

[00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:55.220]
bug off and don't start calling here and tell us how to run the show okay anyway we have these

[00:27:55.220 --> 00:28:01.460]
great dolphins gauge and don't forget a w-i-o-d it's not just a game it's an obsession i'm just

[00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:06.500]
enthralled and you think we had a lot of dolphin promos now just wait a couple of weeks man to be

[00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:12.520]
on like every other second every in the middle of phone calls we're going to be having Rick weaver

[00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:17.540]
singing what do we do with that by the way oh oh yeah yeah this will get that guy upset you think

[00:28:17.540 --> 00:28:23.620]
haha this is Rick weaver voice of the dolphins and today i'm also the voice of a generation

[00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:30.880]
people flying to push down love that but anyway if you want to pick up your dolphin schedule

[00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:34.320]
a sooner or later we're going to tell them where they are because they're all downstairs now waiting

[00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:39.060]
to be distributed by the w-i-o-d account executives to sponsor so i wouldn't hold my breath

[00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:44.140]
but uh the thing that i noticed right away is they've distorted it's not like it's like a tactic

[00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:50.460]
not slanting Donna Mills you know or they shoot her through linoleum that's what in fact one

[00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:55.480]
one show they shot her through cement it was incredible but anyway weaver and golver his side by

[00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:59.180]
side and the pictures like all distorted on the schedule you know my right my exaggerating

[00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:03.300]
by being honest the colors and this is not by accident okay we don't want you to see what they

[00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:07.240]
look like it's the same reason that we're on radio and we try to lay low i mean these guys

[00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:13.280]
the colors like smeared yeah it's like somebody smeared the whole picture before they put it on

[00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:19.480]
here i didn't know rick weeper was award winning oh it says award winning broadcaster rick weeper

[00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:23.260]
are you going to start ripping him now football season you can do it during the off year when he

[00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:27.620]
like just comes in his paycheck is it football season it's getting pretty damn close but

[00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:32.520]
now we're here from rick well i shouldn't be able to tell by the weather outside should exactly

[00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:35.940]
it's only not too much yeah should have jogged about what you immediately go out and start

[00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:40.000]
thinking of shoulder pads and stuff when it's like August yeah especially when you go to

[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:45.200]
south beach and see the husket with their 80 pounds of clothing crossing colons avenue anyway it's

[00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:50.220]

[00:37:51.020 --> 00:37:55.720]
make green together on the same thing but i'm glad you're in here because i got melting pot

[00:37:55.720 --> 00:38:00.820]
coming up right now and i heard i heard through the grapevine that you've been saying that the

[00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:05.640]
melting pot are the imitators which i find fabulous i mean just incredibly interesting because the

[00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:10.500]
guy who started your place which i don't want to mention on the air but the guy who started your

[00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:14.880]
place used to be a waiter at the melting pot in tala hasi that's how he started with fondue as a

[00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:18.680]
waiter and then as he worked there he decided hey look at this they're making all this money and

[00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:22.520]
they're doing great why don't i just go start my own place and he started with the one and now he's

[00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:28.900]
got a couple of ripoff places they're just cheap imitations of the melting pot oh but you

[00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:32.820]
notice how he kind of glosses over there and if you're having trouble hearing steve he's a little

[00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:42.100]
soft-focusing no he didn't just because mic open it's open it is isn't it okay

[00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:51.940]
and he stole it and he ripped it off and he ripped it off what you that's your line okay you

[00:38:51.940 --> 00:38:57.200]
can ask me anything no you know why because they tried it first before your guy put it on

[00:38:57.200 --> 00:39:01.320]
him any they tried it and they just didn't feel that it was up to like the field too which is like

[00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:06.880]
all knots in that place that you ever know it's like knots landing they tried it and they didn't

[00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:11.920]
yes as my friend once and boy it was a real experience is dang clear what you say yes as a matter

[00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:17.000]
of fact it was like knots landing without the landing if it still all washes anyway you'll want

[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:20.880]
the real good fondue if you got any taste you know steve is one of these guys it tries to be

[00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:25.260]
generous to these folks and help them out but the melting pot started fondue in his town they made

[00:39:25.260 --> 00:39:28.680]
it famous they make it better than anybody they got the secret recipes that Greg couldn't

[00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:33.700]
steal right and believe me it's just phenomenal from the cheese appetizers the great chef salad

[00:39:33.700 --> 00:39:37.140]
to the summer sizzler special where you get a little bit of everything there's no lobster

[00:39:37.140 --> 00:39:42.020]
revealed because it's from hunger is fondue but they do have and no free dessert because nobody has

[00:39:42.020 --> 00:39:46.880]
to give away freebies at the melting pot a combination of filet mignon shrimp teriyaki surloin

[00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:51.520]
and breast of chicken all in one great entree the summer sizzler special and save room for those

[00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:55.340]
great desserts and a good part of it is when you get the white amber red o' dessert no nuts

[00:39:55.340 --> 00:39:59.100]
in the dessert you know because they don't melt the Nestle's chocolate bars with the nuts and

[00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:04.340]
it'll like they do at certain other places no nuts in my fondue even Alice said that on a show

[00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:09.860]
this one so you head for one of the three melting pot restaurants tonight or any night seven nights

[00:40:09.860 --> 00:40:15.780]
week that's what he told the officer and he wrote him a second ticket south by me 98 35 sunset drive

[00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:21.560]
north by me beach at 31 43 northeast 163rd and of course the notorious melting pot in

[00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:26.680]
crawl springs just east of West sample road don't forget the Debbie Ella show I guess that's

[00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:32.800]
over now is brought to you today by fiber one no that's the sandy patent news is mailbox and then

[00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:38.280]
of course they have a little a keo pectade for the Alice Rantell show early in the morning in fact

[00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:45.380]
that's the new slogan on a rantell show it's in the bag isn't he soft spoke in the

[00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:53.180]
owl was talking about police officers penis size that's the rumor i don't uh

[00:40:54.940 --> 00:41:00.100]
well he's just that you know if they have a small penis they're they're not you know they're

[00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:03.940]
very sensitive about it and they're they're not in a good mood when they pull you over you know

[00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:10.220]
yeah and and and particularly motorcycle cops he says particularly motorcycle cops man

[00:41:11.540 --> 00:41:19.080]
well no he says he says he says you should ask but they ask you for your license you should ask them

[00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:22.820]
yeah that would always that would be my first instinct is to answer that question you know

[00:41:22.820 --> 00:41:26.740]
I swear I heard this this morning driving to work Steve I swear I was on the dog next person

[00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:32.340]
I'll probably never forget where I was listening to this yeah and a rumor also has did you hear the

[00:41:32.340 --> 00:41:37.020]
part because you told me he spoke to Jeff Charles yes he spoke to Jeff Charles we can hear this

[00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:42.760]
and uh he's covered a whole new format provenance wrote island and uh Jeff you sure wasn't

[00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:47.480]
province town that's what he originally called and Charlie Meadows Meadows.

[00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:50.000]
Meadows. Yes and his name Meadows.

[00:41:51.700 --> 00:41:57.840]
Meadows. Johnny Meadows. Anyway Jeff Charles says he's on three to six up there and he's

[00:41:57.840 --> 00:42:05.300]
discovered this revolutionary new talk radio format no guests they just go on and just talk

[00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:10.920]
and just have a good time you know I don't know where they hear Charles ever got the idea for that

[00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:14.940]
but that's what he said and they were they were agreeing it the guests are terminal often they

[00:42:14.940 --> 00:42:19.380]
have little to say. The list was agreeing. Oh absolutely says that's why they dumped the guest.

[00:42:19.460 --> 00:42:23.420]
That's why he likes to be on the morning. The dream of consciousness. I'd be on the morning. Sidekicks.

[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:32.060]
No question about it make no mistake about it yeah I don't know where he got the idea.

[00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:44.920]
And a sense of humor which he obviously has gone well the stuff about the cops if I was a steric

[00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:50.160]
well anyway and I like those little uh too many calls that he makes because yesterday he called

[00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:54.380]
me her Suarez and he called but who is some of the other big celebrities it's our Tungiri Williams

[00:42:54.380 --> 00:42:59.240]
which is unusual very unusual so I'm like every other day that he's jury kind of like his butt

[00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:05.300]
exactly calls out yeah that's a new format they might try to F.T.L.

[00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:12.240]
Maybe F.T.L. could start like a new format called don't call us we'll call you and it could

[00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:23.240]
just go through the phone book. Yeah it's something to think about. Exactly.

[00:43:23.780 --> 00:43:28.860]
Well we're very issue oriented on this show and I want to say so what do you think of the Metro rail?

[00:43:29.340 --> 00:43:33.520]
The Metro rail? It's just a joke. It's pretty dope. The Metro rail too is just a joke.

[00:43:34.540 --> 00:43:40.120]
I want to say does man Cain? Who? This man Cain? Steve Cain are you gonna rip him now?

[00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:42.380]
All I know is that man. Wait a minute why don't you unplug the mic again?

[00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:47.580]
All I know is the man from whatever it sounds so stupid that he couldn't empty water from a

[00:43:47.580 --> 00:43:55.740]
period of directions from the bottom. Wow. Wow. You know something he's just in heaven now. In fact

[00:43:55.740 --> 00:44:01.100]
he wants you to call on his show so badly he said he would just love to have a little one on one

[00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:06.380]
with you. No problem. I don't know if he's even up to my level I'm 17. Really?

[00:44:06.860 --> 00:44:11.260]
Wait a minute he's typing a message here on the screen it's probably going to be hostile it says

[00:44:11.260 --> 00:44:21.900]
she doesn't have the balls. Well I'm sure of that. To call in another word she says you don't

[00:44:21.900 --> 00:44:25.520]
have the guts to call him one on one and face to face. What time to show?

[00:44:25.860 --> 00:44:29.640]
Now wait a minute are you making all these comments about him you've heard his show haven't you?

[00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:34.220]
I know from what I've heard from other people who listen to him. Yeah.

[00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:36.820]
And from the bottom of my head. Well now I wouldn't see but that's not fair okay.

[00:44:37.380 --> 00:44:40.980]
I mean if you're only hearing a second hand what? I'll listen to him today.

[00:44:41.100 --> 00:44:45.860]
Ah see now try that. No now don't you realize you're hearing a second hand from other people

[00:44:45.860 --> 00:44:49.260]
who listen and you're making all these accusations. I mean what you said probably is true.

[00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:53.740]
Ah. No seriously that's a terrible thing to do it's a bad habit to get into is take it.

[00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:59.080]
Now you just got through complimenting me for not going through all of BS and you know telling

[00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:03.280]
it like it is you've got to make your judgments based on what you hear and what you feel.

[00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:07.680]
Not what somebody some other jackass tells you right? Because your friends probably are

[00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:12.980]
bozos too from time to time right? Definitely. Definitely. There you go. So you listen today you're

[00:45:12.980 --> 00:45:16.880]
going to promise me. I promise. And I want you to call me tomorrow and then you give us your own

[00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:21.500]
personal honest opinion and then you can call Steve tomorrow too if you're not you know paranoid.

[00:45:22.780 --> 00:45:27.300]
Okay promise. I promise. Talk to you tomorrow. Okay. See now we got you new list new there. She's

[00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:32.840]
17 great demographic. She sounds like you know she's bubbly and effervescent and she's going to listen

[00:45:32.840 --> 00:45:37.460]
herself. See it just becomes fashionable to say those things that like Steve is some kind of a

[00:45:37.460 --> 00:45:42.440]
monk head douchebag. If you say it and you mean it from personal experience then it has some

[00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:46.980]
significance. But just to say it because it's the popular thing to say that's that's going along

[00:45:46.980 --> 00:45:53.080]
with the crowd okay I just can't find it. Dear field. Yeah Neil. Yeah. Yeah how you doing? Okay.

[00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:58.000]
Listen I was flying in from New York yesterday. Boy how do you press it? Well I guess how uplifting

[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:05.180]
to be flying in from Newark. Yeah right but I had to lay over in Atlanta. Mm hmm. And I was listening

[00:46:05.180 --> 00:46:10.360]
to my radio while I was sitting around in the airport and some guy got into conversation with

[00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:14.420]
some guy at the airport. He said he heard you was transferring up there. Any truth to that? No

[00:46:14.420 --> 00:46:18.240]
there's no truth to it and I don't know whether this call is for real or whether this is one of those

[00:46:18.780 --> 00:46:24.460]
provocative calls that somebody has set you up to make but we have a jackass who started rumors

[00:46:24.460 --> 00:46:27.820]
in Atlanta yesterday that I was coming up there and that the world was going to come to it and I'm

[00:46:27.820 --> 00:46:32.600]
this terrible person going to WSP. What are the chances you think of my going to work in Atlanta sir?

[00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:36.700]
Yeah I didn't think it made much sense. No I didn't see you for a couple of years now. Yeah.

[00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:41.740]
You know I can't get in the antenna big enough to pick up a station in Atlanta so I'd have to follow

[00:46:41.740 --> 00:46:45.660]
you up there. There you go. Well I got news for it. They gave me a list of a hundred cities to go to

[00:46:45.660 --> 00:46:50.520]
that would be one of the last five. Yeah I hear that. Okay. Okay thanks a lot. Have a great life sir.

[00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:57.980]
Oh we're back to that again huh? 136 at WIOD we have an open line in Broward at 524 WIOD 524

[00:46:57.980 --> 00:47:02.520]
946. He said when somebody says well I've heard rumors as this individual who was up there yesterday

[00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:08.040]
did there were no rumors. He's the one that started that now. Okay just to be provocative and to be

[00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:13.080]
a more harassment and just to create more problems and of course time and time again it just backfires

[00:47:13.580 --> 00:47:18.860]
because he's not fooling anybody okay. But like I said if you wait long enough 40 or 50 years the

[00:47:18.860 --> 00:47:22.300]
wheels of justice in this country will see that everything is straightened out have no fear.

[00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:27.520]
Right now speaking of that speaking of the wheels of justice if your car is stolen you want to sit

[00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:31.880]
around waiting for the insurance company to settle you want to sit around waiting forever to see

[00:47:31.880 --> 00:47:35.880]
if they're ever going to find your car because 999 out of 100 they're not going to find it unless

[00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:41.180]
you have that low jack in your car okay this is an incredible device we've seen it demonstrated

[00:47:41.180 --> 00:47:45.300]
personally I think most of us here at the station about a chance to go with the folks from low jack

[00:47:45.300 --> 00:47:49.420]
and they've taken us out and hidden one of the cars and then they show us how the thing actually

[00:47:49.420 --> 00:47:54.080]
works and here's how it does work they hide that little tiny transmitter a radio transmitter in your

[00:47:54.080 --> 00:47:58.640]
car truck and if your car is stolen all you do is call the police immediately and they automatically

[00:47:58.640 --> 00:48:03.320]
activate that transmitter and they have a device that tracks it and they can just home in on it in a

[00:48:03.320 --> 00:48:07.940]
matter of minutes the average time is about a half an hour they can find that car while it's still in

[00:48:07.940 --> 00:48:12.940]
one piece while it's still worth getting back. So it's offload of being number one in auto theft in

[00:48:12.940 --> 00:48:17.540]
the entire country it just makes sense to protect a big investment by having low jack in fact low

[00:48:17.540 --> 00:48:22.380]
jack isn't expensive it's guaranteed an installation by bonded technicians can be done quickly at your

[00:48:22.380 --> 00:48:27.580]
home or office and when you talk to them be sure and ask about that 25% discount on your comprehensive

[00:48:27.580 --> 00:48:32.000]
insurance when you have low jack. Call them today for more information call their toll free number

[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:39.100]
1-800-30 I wouldn't think so yeah I wouldn't think so okay Neil you have a very nice day I think

[00:48:39.300 --> 00:48:45.520]
touched all the bases sir and I just wish he would uh besides they contrived debate try to go toe

[00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:50.520]
to toe with you those were the fun days right there's no match whatever you say yes sir have a great

[00:48:50.520 --> 00:48:56.640]
life okay well there was a real butt kisser if I ever heard one 142 at WIOD by the way the rumor is we

[00:48:56.640 --> 00:49:00.800]
were picking on Scott again about the noise and that's not true in spite of what our friend from

[00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:04.920]
engineering told you in a hallway we hear about all these things he didn't say that to you Sharon was

[00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:11.680]
making it up just tell Tim to get a life and go back and hang out with Rick Edwards would you

[00:49:12.520 --> 00:49:16.140]
anyway boy look at these phones all of a sudden like in noon it's like everybody got off of

[00:49:16.140 --> 00:49:21.200]
playing maybe they were coming from Newark okay with that other guy through Atlanta maybe

[00:49:21.880 --> 00:49:25.120]
everything's straight not every I think everybody here had to get something out of their system

[00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:29.340]
kind of like Bill Wise oh needs to get something out of his system okay in fact we have the

[00:49:29.340 --> 00:49:35.260]
animal bag that just might do the job okay it's a Debbie yellow special it's a poor bagger okay

[00:49:35.900 --> 00:49:39.820]
see you think that four baggers an old baseball expression for home run but four

[00:49:39.820 --> 00:49:45.960]
baggers really from the Bill Wise School of cleansing internal cleansing and if anybody can use it man

[00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:51.280]
now let's see there is is that Laura that I see because the window does things here that's Laura

[00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:56.120]
now I've got all the stuff that I'm gonna have to record you doing that today doing that today as

[00:49:56.120 --> 00:50:00.260]
soon as I get off and Mitch came in here and he said have no fear you can make it as warm as you want

[00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:05.680]
no problem at all so I'll crank it up to about 90 go in there and sweat my way through some of

[00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:09.480]
those spots because next week I know this comes as a shock but it's a long overdue for me I'm going

[00:50:09.480 --> 00:50:14.220]
on vacation again I'm almost I'm almost in bear it but I got a news for it's not my fault that

[00:50:14.220 --> 00:50:18.320]
it's also close together I was taking the first part in March as you remember at the end of March

[00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:22.620]
and then a little Miss Muffet back in sales set up this thing I had to do and I couldn't go away

[00:50:22.620 --> 00:50:26.980]
and she screwed up my whole vacation schedule but to be honest with you I like the way it worked out

[00:50:26.980 --> 00:50:32.780]
a lot yeah because between the Chicago trip jammed in there in between and then these other

[00:50:32.780 --> 00:50:37.400]
vacations it's like just you know it's I feel like I'm part of management on a permanent vacation

[00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:41.640]
that much yeah in fact little did people know but you know that album by your oh Smith permanent

[00:50:41.640 --> 00:50:47.820]
vacation was about people in management broadcast manage I knew that well I'm sure you did okay let's

[00:50:48.880 --> 00:50:53.040]
why am I having such a good time all of a sudden I think it had to do with when Steve was in here

[00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:56.320]
with a mic over I think that was the word it was it was it was it was yesterday when Arnold's brought

[00:50:56.320 --> 00:51:00.240]
the food and suddenly our whole attitude chain yeah same thing happened today I mean a show today

[00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:04.620]
was a lot better but it was not great better and then Steve came in and we got him I mean nailed

[00:51:04.620 --> 00:51:09.320]
him with that you know hidden mic trick and all of a sudden I feel like life was almost worth living

[00:51:09.320 --> 00:51:14.500]
again I couldn't believe it worked well no because he didn't notice it and when you do like I say

[00:51:14.500 --> 00:51:18.720]
you don't use the overhead you're not sensitive to it and you just the oral blivious yeah

[00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:23.240]
mech green new mech green new right away and that's frightening if mech new and Steve didn't I think

[00:51:23.240 --> 00:51:29.640]
that that's true that says it all absolutely Miami hello congratulations on that extraordinary

[00:51:29.640 --> 00:51:37.320]
good interview with Kane he never sounded better I think we have our first first whole question

[00:51:37.320 --> 00:51:42.860]
answer we're here they listen about ball Kane wouldn't know but we talked to just Charles anytime

[00:51:42.860 --> 00:51:48.380]
concerning that mech why don't you go back to Chicago and drop a few bucks I know you had a lot

[00:51:48.380 --> 00:51:54.440]

[00:52:21.160 --> 00:52:26.580]
Hollywood on a 441 between Tapt and Sheridan would like to send special look at wishes to rabbi

[00:52:26.580 --> 00:52:30.680]
uh what was his name I don't know who pick who was on the cane chose another one of his good friends

[00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:35.660]
boy has he got a circle of friends that even even Hermann Gearing would be embarrassed by that proud

[00:52:36.220 --> 00:52:41.540]
but anyway if you want a great deal on the quality use car right over on the west side of 441

[00:52:41.540 --> 00:52:47.140]
across from the new car lot you will find literally acres and acres of great quality

[00:52:47.140 --> 00:52:51.660]
reconditioned use cars now let's face it not every car that's traded in at Toyota of Hollywood is

[00:52:51.660 --> 00:52:55.520]
going to be you know great they're going to get some lemons and what they do with those I'm sure

[00:52:55.520 --> 00:52:58.600]
they get rid of those privately you know what I mean or they drive me to the bay or they do

[00:52:58.600 --> 00:53:02.080]
something else because when they sell you a use car they want to make sure that it's been totally

[00:53:02.080 --> 00:53:05.480]
reconditioned that it's in great running shape and will give you a good dependable transportation

[00:53:05.480 --> 00:53:10.400]
at a price that you can afford so instead of taking somebody else's nightmares from those used

[00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:13.480]
car lots and then finding that they're out of business when you go back to have it fixed

[00:53:13.480 --> 00:53:18.640]
head for a great deal on a good use car at Toyota of Hollywood's used car lot and don't forget one

[00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:22.880]
of the acres there is devoted to the buy here pay here a lot for those of your real sluppers who

I hung up on everybody in the beginning of the show because we had a lot of stuff to talk about

[01:02:31.780 --> 01:02:37.140]

[01:02:37.140 --> 01:02:43.080]

[01:03:07.420 --> 01:03:13.400]
leave them lying there in the dirt hmm and debating her and another one of Steve's famous contrived

[01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:19.260]
debates will be doctor Irene lip-aw who's a lip-aw of the old block and says she's revolted by

[01:03:19.260 --> 01:03:25.020]
Joella's anti female outlook and things Joella should boil an oil with bill wise and bill mullen

[01:03:25.020 --> 01:03:30.040]
